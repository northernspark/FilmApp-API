2
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,347
Next, please.

3
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,728
Next!

4
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,076
Don't fool around

5
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,786
Okay

6
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:23,667
Did you hear what I said?

7
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:27,587
I want to document
our trip to America.

8
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,547
Next, please. Next.

9
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:33,510
How you doing?
Can I see your documents?

10
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,180
What is the purpose of your
visit to the United States?

11
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:38,306
Two weeks holiday.

12
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,684
Do you have
a return-trip ticket?

13
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,852
Excuse me. No photography
in the F.I.S. area.

14
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:46,231
Is he travelling with you?
Are you two together?

15
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,482
Yes.

16
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,984
Sir, come on up. Join us.

17
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,154
Is there a problem?

18
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,032
No. If you're together
I want to talk to you together.

19
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,326
-Can I see your documents?
-Sure.

20
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,079
Passport, please.
Are you related?

21
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,540
Yes. He's my friend.

22
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,754
You're a Czech national
and you're a Russian national.

23
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,965
How do you know one another?

24
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,718
We know each other from Prague.

25
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,637
-How long are you staying?
-Two weeks.

26
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,639
I'd like him to answer
for himself.

27
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,558
But he doesn't speak English.

28
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,602
No, sir.
I speakvery good English.

29
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:28,273
I'm here for movies.

30
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:30,900
For movies?
I don't understand.

31
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,987
When I was a boy,
I've seen at my school...

32
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,741
movie called
"It's Wonderful Life..."

33
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,909
directed by Frank Capra...

34
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,496
and ever since I just want
to come to United States...

35
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,333
Iand of the free,
home of the brave...

36
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,002
a country where anyone
can be anything.

37
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,879
Bullshit!

38
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,672
"Abandoned baby
in Times Square."

39
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,758
Come on,
it's too fucking soft.

40
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:58,178
It won't work,
and it won't get the numbers.

41
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,889
Are you suggesting that
we manufacture bad news?

42
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,016
It's what they tune us infor.

43
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,061
We're a tabloid show.
They tune infor rough stuff.

44
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,979
The net work's up
my pretty little ass to change.

45
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,440
Every lobbyist, mom,
and politician...

46
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,192
is screaming about
violence in prime time.

47
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:13,943
We've got to broaden the format.

48
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,945
Broaden the format.

49
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,989
The story they will run
is the one with the juice.

50
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,866
They want ratings
as much as I do.

51
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,827
If it bleeds, it leads.
What have you got?

52
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,746
Ride-along with Eddie Flemming.

53
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,414
-Fuck, again?!
-Cover of "People."

54
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,875
He is not new.

55
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,586
Eddie's a dear friend,
but we've done him to death.

56
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:32,962
No, this is good.

57
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:34,464
The psychiatrist
goes to trial tomorrow.

58
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,966
The ratings'll hit the roof.
What's Eddie doing?

59
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,760
He's staking out
a Jamaican serial killer.

60
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,178
That's good.

61
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:43,807
I don't want blood and guts!
Broaden the format!

62
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,768
I know they brought you in
to be the journalism cop--

63
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,312
-Excuse me!
-You're killing my show!

64
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,273
Don't forget,
Eddie's always good TV.

65
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,067
Not when he's drunk.

66
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,569
He's got a new cure for that.

67
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,793
-When?
-Tomorrow at lunch.

68
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,347
Ready, set.

69
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,892
Let's go.

70
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,979
Thrill of the hunt.

71
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:51,184
Look, Times square.
Just like the movies!

72
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,977
Don't speak Russian!

73
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,147
Why do I always have to
Speak to you in Czech?

74
00:05:56,523 --> 00:06:00,568
Because I don't like your
ugly language, okay?

75
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,288
Taxi!

76
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,214
"Fuji colour...

77
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:24,384
"adjustable shutter speed...

78
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,971
"nightvision, infrared...

79
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,389
"black and white.

80
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,101
"Make your own movies."

81
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,905
Damn!
Watch where you're going!

82
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,871
Where'd that big guy go
with the video?

83
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,956
He stole my camera!
Stop that guy in the cab!

84
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,709
-Go! Go!
-Stop that guy in the cab!

85
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,920
Bryan,we're pulling up now.
This is important.

86
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,048
I need fresh footage for
the piece on Eddie tonight...

87
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,008
so come in fast on my signal
with the camera rolling.

88
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,093
You got it?

89
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,144
So what's Unique?

90
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,772
Not what, who. From Jamaica.

91
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,191
His girlfriend took too long
putting her make-up on.

92
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,985
They were late for a party.

93
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,946
-Stabbed her with a bottle.
-Jesus Christ.

94
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,865
That's unique. Shit.

95
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,493
He still went to the party.

96
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:35,872
Topfloor, back room.

97
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:37,666
Eddie, autograph, mon.

98
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,751
Phone number.

99
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,753
Why your picture not on this?

100
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:43,838
-Bounce.
-All right.

101
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,134
Yo, Unique.
5-0's on the way, bro.

102
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:49,969
-Cops?
-Let's go.

103
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,054
Love you too, man.

104
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,889
Who does he think Leon was?

105
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,474
It won't matter.

106
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,351
He'll hear the cops are coming
and just get out.

107
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,478
-Come on. Be quiet
-Right.

108
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,022
-Stand by.
-Standing by.

109
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,191
Eddie, are you gonna
be home tonight?

110
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,901
We're running
the Stephen Geller piece.

111
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,278
Again? You ran that fucking
thing a thousand times.

112
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,280
So what?
He's going to court tomorrow.

113
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,615
The psychiatrist's trial
is starting.

114
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,701
Ratings'll be through the roof.

115
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,288
Hey, get out.

116
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,711
Do me a favour.
Cut my interview out.

117
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,796
What for? Jesus Christ.

118
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,257
Are you getting shit
from downtown? Fuck them.

119
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,342
You're the only one
making big cases in this town.

120
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,554
I bring the big cases,
that brings the big news.

121
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,764
That stuff hurts
as much as it helps.

122
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,142
Get real jealous downtown.

123
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,769
Stay behind me.

124
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,564
Hope this fuck don't run.
My knees are killing me.

125
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,191
Be quiet. Get back.

126
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,902
Are you worried about my safety?
I'm touched.

127
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:50,947
Go! Get away!

128
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,366
Just keep them out of my way.

129
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,493
-You ready?
-Robert,we're ready.

130
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,954
You ready? Let's go.

131
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,499
Go on! Just get out!

132
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,172
Come on,you fucking guys!
Come in rolling!

133
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,215
What's your rush?
You going to a party?

134
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,176
What you chase me for?

135
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,595
You always leave your house
like that?

136
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,430
This not my bloody house!

137
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,516
-You live here?
-Me don't live here!

138
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,185
That sounds like
burglary to me, pal.

139
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,145
Eddie, any chance
we could get that again?

140
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,522
I didn't want to do it
in the first place.

141
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,527
Are you fucking kidding me?
Turn that fucking thing off!

142
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,738
Are you out of your mind?
Where the hell were you?

143
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,825
You two are a waste
of my goddamn life! Fuck!

144
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,176
No, Emil, get the position.

145
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:55,970
-What?
-First scene of my new movie.

146
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,057
Collecting our share
from the bankjob.

147
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,726
And...action.

148
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,190
Just a moment!

149
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:11,528
Who's there?

150
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,113
It's Emil.

151
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,017
How are you?

152
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,855
Glad to see you.

153
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,656
Olga said he didn't
know where you were.

154
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,116
If you are trying to hide,

155
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:01,786
You shouldn't write to her
with your return adress!

156
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,666
Beautiful necklace.

157
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:21,097
Effects. Video Effects.

158
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,600
It wasn't my fault
you two got caught.

159
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,185
I know.

160
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,605
Please, it's hisfault.
It's really hisfault.

161
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,607
Trying to get
the bank clerk's phone number.

162
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,442
How could I wait?

163
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,695
Hey, you didn't tell us
she was your wife!

164
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,865
That's why I didn't tell you!
Because of what you did!

165
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,453
Let'sforget all this shit!

166
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:48,917
Hang on. Calm down.

167
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,214
You know what?

168
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,884
Give me my money.

169
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:03,139
Emil,we spent it.

170
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,183
What?

171
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:08,186
Look at the way we live.

172
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:09,437
I'm a plumber.

173
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,314
Nice watch.

174
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:14,025
You think I'd be working
if I had money?

175
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:21,574
What's going on?
Just give me my money.

176
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,034
I'll helpyou.

177
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,160
You'll help me?

178
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,496
I get you a job.

179
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:27,622
A job?

180
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,666
The money is good.

181
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,334
A job as a plumber?

182
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:33,712
It's easy. It's good.

183
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,800
You think I came
to America to work?

184
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,051
No way.

185
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,679
We started over.
You can, too.

186
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,891
Emil, please.
I'm your friend.

187
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,978
I'm your friend--

188
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:51,521
Sorry.

189
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:56,317
It's my fault.
Emil, please--

190
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,904
Emil, put down the knife!

191
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:03,116
You spent all my money
while I was in prison?

192
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,994
You're telling me to get a job?

193
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:07,912
As a plumber,
fixing fucking toilets?!

194
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,080
Please, put down the knife!

195
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,583
-You're my friend!
-Yes, I am!

196
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,251
You're my best friend!

197
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:17,589
Please, put down the knife.
Emil, please.

198
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,400
Shut up!

199
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:39,569
Shut up!

200
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,135
She saw.

201
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,849
-What are you looking for?
-Her wallet, you idiot.

202
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:17,732
Daphne Handlova. Six-month visa.

203
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,486
Still here after two years.

204
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:23,780
She'll call the police.
She will!

205
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,865
She is illegal!

206
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:48,513
Turn that fucking
sick thing off!

207
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:51,307
Do as I say!

208
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:12,912
What are you looking for?

209
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,377
Ah, no!

210
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:23,465
Bohemian barbecue.

211
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,010
Man,what you got for me?

212
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,720
I don't have time
for this tonight.

213
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:12,389
Where the fuck you going?

214
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,641
Do yourself a favour
and get the hell outta here.

215
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,351
Gonna make me bust your ass?

216
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,770
I'm not telling you again.
This ain't a smart move.

217
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:20,814
Give me your fucking money--

218
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,650
You happy now?
Now you're under arrest.

219
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,985
-You the cops?
-Fire Department.

220
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,696
Firemen don't carry
no damn guns.

221
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,657
Guess again.
I'm an arson investigator.

222
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:31,950
We do everything cops do.

223
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:34,828
Yo, man, come on!

224
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,788
All right,
we're getting up on three.

225
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:38,248
One, two, three.

226
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,875
Why don't you
let a brother off, man?

227
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,628
No harm, nofoul.
My bad, dawg.

228
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:46,047
What's up, man? Come on!

229
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,718
-Put your hand up there.
-What you gonna do?

230
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,220
-Where you going?
-To a fire.

231
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,889
-Hell, no!
-I'll send a cop back!

232
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:56,516
Oh, hell, mother fucker!

233
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,352
You can't leave me hand cuffed
to no goddamn tree!

234
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:02,439
Some freak'll come up
in here and stab me, man!

235
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:19,331
Make sure EMS is standing by.

236
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,333
We'll have to take
the bodies out pretty soon.

237
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,502
Let's get the fourth winches
to the front of the building.

238
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,338
Chief, you first due?

239
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:29,966
Yeah. I got two roasts
up on the top floor.

240
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:33,595
You don't have to investigate
because Homicide's here.

241
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:35,597
Homicide?
Who said they could go up there?

242
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,182
I didn't make this
a crime scene yet.

243
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,310
-It's Eddie Flemming.
-Fuck him.

244
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,395
Jordy, where you been?
We got a celebrity.

245
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,231
I heard.
Who the hell let him up there?

246
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,150
Don't know. Think Eddie'll
give me his autograph?

247
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,235
Maybe he'll give you
a kiss, too.

248
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,783
-Hey, Cap.
-Bobby.

249
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,826
Stairs are soggy.

250
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:01,331
-Hey, Eddie.
-What?

251
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,375
Looks to me,
from the 69 position...

252
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,293
that they were doing each other.

253
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:06,753
They must've been
smoking something...

254
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,755
and were so wacked
out of their heads...

255
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,924
that they got careless,
lit up the mattress...

256
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,343
and set themselves onfire.

257
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:15,345
I don't know.
We got the experts here.

258
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,013
Show them what you found?

259
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:18,515
Hope you don't mind, guys.

260
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:19,766
We thought maybe
you needed some help.

261
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:22,394
Not at all.
Detective? Bobby Korfin.

262
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:25,063
-How you doing, Bobby?
-My Uncle Tony worked with you.

263
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:26,940
Detective,you mind
putting that cigar out?

264
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:29,067
-Trying to pick up a scent.
-Sorry.

265
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:32,737
I'm glad you guys
got it allfigured out...

266
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:34,280
but you mind if we go
through our routine?

267
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,408
Give us something to do.

268
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:37,951
We don't mind.

269
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,287
-No, certainly.
-Appreciate it.

270
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,331
-Be our guest.
-Thanks.

271
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:46,334
Talk about smoking after sex.

272
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,221
We got a fast-burning fire.

273
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,559
We got some good
low patterns down here.

274
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,648
-Mouth's clean.
-Clean?

275
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:10,775
So let me get this straight...

276
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:13,236
you think a couple of crackheads
burned themselves up?

277
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:15,030
That's what it looks like to me.

278
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:16,531
While they're burning up...

279
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,450
they're still going down
on one another?

280
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,160
Gotta hand it to them.

281
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,829
I guess some people have
their priorities straight.

282
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,998
I guess they do.

283
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:30,712
Flammable.

284
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:33,381
Thank you.

285
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:35,425
-What's that?
-Evidence.

286
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,677
Of a homicide.

287
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:41,806
-You know what that is?
-No,what?

288
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:44,017
Camello,
punch a hole in the corner.

289
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,144
I want to look at the floor.

290
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:52,108
They have no soot
in their mouths...

291
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:53,568
which means they weren't
breathing before the fire...

292
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:55,904
and this little piece
of cloth...

293
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:57,572
means they were doused
in a flammable liquid...

294
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,949
and then positioned
like this on the bed.

295
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,826
To the untrained eye,
it looks like an accident.

296
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:03,244
No offence.

297
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,413
What's he looking for?

298
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,627
He's looking for a timer.

299
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:19,094
Here you go.
Big double homicide.

300
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,263
Good.

301
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,683
Just take some deep breaths.

302
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,644
Did you see the look
on Eddie'sface...

303
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,604
when you handed him
that timer?

304
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,190
Damn, I wish
I had a picture of him.

305
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,275
He knew all along, though.

306
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:35,402
What?

307
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:37,153
Why do you think
he was so quiet?

308
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:38,988
He was testing us.

309
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,074
You think so?

310
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:44,536
Detective,
does it look like a murder?

311
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:46,788
We haven't determined
the exact cause of death yet.

312
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:47,956
There's a lot of answers
we still haven't got.

313
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:50,625
-How many victims?
-Two bodies.

314
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,919
-Have you identified them?
-Not positively.

315
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:54,379
Is it drug-related?

316
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:57,716
We don't know the cause
of the fire or the deaths.

317
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:00,010
We get them all,
we'll let you know.

318
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,137
What's this in your hand?
Evidence?

319
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:03,847
This is something
we found on the scene.

320
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:06,391
Whether it's evidence or not
has yet to be determined.

321
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,393
-Thank you, Detective.
-You're welcome.

322
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:15,150
See you.

323
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:35,587
Do you see her?

324
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:37,547
Who?

325
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:40,216
There was a woman in the crowd.
She looked scared.

326
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:42,719
Looked like
she wanted to talk to us.

327
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:46,681
Shit.

328
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,860
Get a blanket.

329
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,529
Now here you come.
It's about fucking time.

330
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:03,073
What the hell happened to you?

331
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:05,617
She stripped me, man.
A bag lady.

332
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:07,118
Stripped all my clothes off.

333
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:09,746
Grabbing me in my nuts.
It was disgusting.

334
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:12,457
Consider yourself lucky.
I won't lock you up.

335
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,250
You're free to go.
Get the hell outta here.

336
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:16,044
A dog pissed on me, man!

337
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:17,879
You violated my civil rights.

338
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,590
We got you for robbery one.
Take a walk.

339
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:23,677
So, before you slept with her...

340
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:26,554
with your own son's wife...

341
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:29,557
did you take even a second to
think about the consequences?

342
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,769
I take full responsibility
for sleeping with her.

343
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:34,813
I had very low self-esteem.

344
00:22:35,313 --> 00:22:38,942
I had to compete with somebody.
It happened to be my son.

345
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:42,237
You're blaming this
on low self-esteem?

346
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:44,114
I had a lot of
behavioural disorders.

347
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:46,408
A behavioural disorder
and low self-esteem...

348
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:48,159
makes you have sex
with your son's wife?

349
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:49,911
It's not all hisfault.

350
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:53,289
No, that's true.
What about your wife?

351
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,626
He's ignored me for months.
I had no one around.

352
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:58,962
I didn't think that
he loved me anymore.

353
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:13,810
How could somebody
who loved somebody do that?

354
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,062
That's the lowest thing
you could ever possibly do.

355
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:18,940
"Self-esteem."

356
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,450
"Low self-esteem."

357
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:35,248
Turn off the camera.

358
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:36,875
I'm not filming anything.

359
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:38,126
Turn off the fucking camera!

360
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:39,878
I'm watching Milos die.

361
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:41,713
Turn it off!

362
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:44,507
Let go.

363
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:47,844
Don't break it! Don't break it!

364
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:49,429
How do you erase it?

365
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:50,472
I'll do it! I'll do it!

366
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,556
Get rid of it!

367
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,101
Don't speak to me in Russian.

368
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:58,146
You got it?

369
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:01,858
Erase it! Erase it now!

370
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:04,194
Just erase it!

371
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:18,541
Daphne Handlova.

372
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:26,216
What's this?

373
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:29,469
"Worldly Escorts."

374
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,930
"Worldly." What is it?

375
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:36,559
What is it?

376
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:40,188
I'm serious.
Get on your knees.

377
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:51,032
Look me in the eyes
and tell me you're sorry.

378
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:53,243
Let me see if I believe you.

379
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:54,953
I'm very sorry
for what I've done.

380
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:56,871
I promise
I'll never do it again.

381
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,124
How come we don't believe you?

382
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:04,504
Are you looking
for companionship?

383
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:06,715
Yes. I'm homesick.

384
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:11,386
I can set you up
with a realfine date.

385
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:14,055
Do you have Eastern European
girl, Czech girl?

386
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:16,725
-Of course.
-Askfor Russian girl.

387
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:19,853
Whatever you want.
As a matter off act...

388
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:23,773
I have a lovely
Czech girl right here.

389
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:26,818
Send her. I take her.

390
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:28,653
What's your address?

391
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:31,948
-Can you forgive him?
-Give me a hug.

392
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:33,742
Wait a minute. Hold on.

393
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:42,417
That's a good start there.

394
00:26:02,854 --> 00:26:03,938
Now that you know Eddie,
maybe he'll put you...

395
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:05,774
in the next movie about him.

396
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:06,900
You think so?

397
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:09,110
You can play his wife.

398
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:13,740
What's up, Chief?

399
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:15,825
What the hell is that?

400
00:26:16,284 --> 00:26:18,495
What is that in your hand?
Evidence?

401
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:19,871
This is something
we found on the scene.

402
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,207
Whether it's evidence or not,
we're not sure.

403
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:25,335
You gave Eddie Flemming
the evidence?

404
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:27,087
Who did cause and origin?

405
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:29,339
Chief,who do you think did?
We did.

406
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:31,800
Then why didn't you
talk to the reporter?

407
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:33,843
Because we got more
important things to do...

408
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:35,887
Iike finding out who did it.

409
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:37,972
Really?

410
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:43,228
Don't you guys understand?

411
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:44,979
It is all about image.

412
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:48,483
The better we look,
the more money I get to pay you.

413
00:27:02,914 --> 00:27:04,416
Good evening.
I'm Robert Hawkins...

414
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:06,543
and this is "Top Story."

415
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:09,212
Tonight we have an exclusive
interview with Stephen Geller...

416
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:10,922
who horrified the nation
two years ago...

417
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:14,884
when he murdered three clerks
in a Manhattan shoe store.

418
00:27:15,343 --> 00:27:17,095
But now, Mr Geller's claim...

419
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:19,514
spoken softly
and articulately...

420
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:22,684
is that he is the victim.

421
00:27:23,143 --> 00:27:25,603
Hard to believe. Watch.

422
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:29,816
These people died...

423
00:27:30,275 --> 00:27:32,652
because of the criminal actions
of my psychiatrist.

424
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:35,030
He didn't insist
that I stay on my medication.

425
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:38,116
So you feel absolutely
no responsibility...

426
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:39,534
for killing these people?

427
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:42,412
It was my finger
that pulled the trigger...

428
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:45,206
but morally,
I'm not responsible.

429
00:27:45,665 --> 00:27:47,876
My psychiatrist
knew what I was capable of.

430
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:49,502
How can I know?
I'm not a doctor.

431
00:27:49,961 --> 00:27:52,130
That seems very savvy
for a man who's beenfound...

432
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:53,965
mentally incompetent
to stand trial.

433
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:55,967
I'm a victim here, too.

434
00:27:56,426 --> 00:27:58,470
My life has been
permanently disrupted.

435
00:27:58,928 --> 00:28:00,096
Permanently disrupted?

436
00:28:00,555 --> 00:28:02,140
Hasn't this "incident,"
as you call it...

437
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,184
jump-started your career
as an artist?

438
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:06,311
Isn't there a movie
in the works?

439
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,772
We're in negotiations.
That's correct.

440
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:12,108
Doesn't the "Son of Sam" Iaw
prohibit convicted criminals...

441
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:13,568
from profiting
from their crimes?

442
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:16,404
It doesn't apply to me
because I'm not a criminal.

443
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:19,366
I wasn't convicted.

444
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:22,827
I wasfound to be
temporarily insane.

445
00:28:23,286 --> 00:28:26,122
I love America.

446
00:28:26,581 --> 00:28:29,668
No one is responsible
for what they do.

447
00:28:33,171 --> 00:28:35,507
-Get in the bathroom.
-We'll fuck her first.

448
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:37,634
-Get in.
-Fuck her first, right?

449
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:40,303
Stay there! Shut up!

450
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:54,609
I'm Honey
from Worldly Escorts.

451
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:56,861
You called us?

452
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,906
And how are you tonight?

453
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:02,534
Where's the Czech girl?

454
00:29:02,993 --> 00:29:04,577
Baby, I'm whatever
you want me to be.

455
00:29:05,036 --> 00:29:10,250
I'm a little schoolgirl,
I'm Mommy, I'm a Czech girl.

456
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:12,127
Now, I like to get business
out of the way...

457
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:13,503
before we get down
to pleasure...

458
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:16,381
so can you put the money
on the dresser?

459
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,718
But I need the Czech girl.

460
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:22,095
Daphne. You know her?

461
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:25,098
It's an outcall service
run from a loft.

462
00:29:25,557 --> 00:29:27,308
I don't know the other girls.

463
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:28,977
Aren't you getting undressed?

464
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:30,228
Where's the escort service?

465
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:32,063
That's confidential.

466
00:29:32,522 --> 00:29:35,025
Can you put the money
on the dresser, please?

467
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:37,235
Yes. Sure.

468
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:39,070
Thank you.

469
00:29:48,204 --> 00:29:52,417
I'd like to talkwith the person
who runs the service.

470
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:54,210
Can you give me her address?

471
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:58,423
Do we have a problem here?

472
00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:02,886
Good. There's no reasonfor us
to have a problem.

473
00:30:04,596 --> 00:30:09,267
I'm gonna make you
feel real good.

474
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,773
Sorry, no smoking.

475
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:20,028
When I'm through with you...

476
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:24,282
you won't even remember
the Czech girl.

477
00:30:27,077 --> 00:30:29,621
Listen to me.

478
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:34,042
I don't want sex.

479
00:30:35,377 --> 00:30:38,672
Just give me the address,
please.

480
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:41,966
Look, I don't give a shit
if you want sex or not...

481
00:30:42,425 --> 00:30:43,343
but you're paying for my time.

482
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:44,803
Just listen to me.

483
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:48,598
Give me the address,
and then you can go.

484
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:51,893
What are you doing?

485
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:54,187
Listen to me.
You got to help me!

486
00:30:54,646 --> 00:30:56,690
Just calm down
and listen to me.

487
00:30:57,148 --> 00:30:59,651
Give me the fucking address,
and then you go!

488
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,654
Please,you got to help me.

489
00:31:03,113 --> 00:31:04,656
I need your help!

490
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:15,834
All right! OK!

491
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:18,128
It's in my purse. No!

492
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:20,213
Shit! God!

493
00:31:23,425 --> 00:31:25,301
Help me!

494
00:31:26,594 --> 00:31:27,345
No! Help me!

495
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:31,057
No! God! Someone!
Please help!

496
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:37,814
No! Help!

497
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:59,169
What really stood out
about this girl were her eyes.

498
00:31:59,627 --> 00:32:03,131
She had the most amazing huge
blue eyes you've ever seen.

499
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:06,718
Just absolutely beautiful.

500
00:32:07,177 --> 00:32:08,386
How long they been
living in your building?

501
00:32:08,845 --> 00:32:11,056
Fouryears.

502
00:32:11,514 --> 00:32:13,558
I'll give you a call as soon
as we know something more.

503
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:17,103
-What do you got?
-Milos and Tamina Karlova.

504
00:32:17,562 --> 00:32:18,897
They were quiet
and kept to themselves.

505
00:32:19,356 --> 00:32:21,232
Landlord don't know
who your girl is.

506
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,947
OK if I smoke?

507
00:33:10,323 --> 00:33:12,075
It's your crime scene now.

508
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:13,785
Do whateveryou want.

509
00:33:14,244 --> 00:33:16,538
Did you watch the news?

510
00:33:16,997 --> 00:33:18,873
I must have missed it.

511
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:21,876
Just so you know...

512
00:33:23,169 --> 00:33:25,296
I gave you guys all the credit.

513
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:28,091
Well,just so you know...

514
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:31,011
I don't really care
about that stuff.

515
00:33:31,469 --> 00:33:33,680
Why should you?

516
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:35,932
I don't even watch TV.

517
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:40,103
Good. Good.
That's commendable.

518
00:33:44,107 --> 00:33:45,692
You get a report from the M.E.?

519
00:33:46,151 --> 00:33:48,320
Sure did.

520
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:51,656
I want to ask you something.

521
00:33:52,115 --> 00:33:53,616
You got a problem with me?

522
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:57,495
If you showed up and found me
stepping on your crime scene...

523
00:33:57,954 --> 00:34:00,123
and remember, it was
my crime scene yesterday...

524
00:34:00,582 --> 00:34:02,208
it might piss you off, too.

525
00:34:06,338 --> 00:34:07,630
What about the report?

526
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:10,342
You were right.
Both dead before the fire.

527
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,926
The man was stabbed so hard...

528
00:34:12,385 --> 00:34:14,554
the killer broke off the tip
of the knife in his spine.

529
00:34:15,013 --> 00:34:17,557
That usually indicates
something pretty personal.

530
00:34:30,236 --> 00:34:31,905
Super said
he's seen her before...

531
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:35,325
but she didn't live here.

532
00:34:36,618 --> 00:34:38,328
Prettiest suspect
I've had in a while.

533
00:34:38,787 --> 00:34:41,539
I don't know if she has
anything to do with this.

534
00:34:41,998 --> 00:34:43,750
I saw her outside
after the fire...

535
00:34:44,209 --> 00:34:45,251
and thought maybe
it was a lead.

536
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,920
Thought maybe
she saw something.

537
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:50,382
Why would they
have taken the trouble...

538
00:34:52,884 --> 00:34:55,428
to position the bodies
like that?

539
00:34:57,013 --> 00:34:59,265
Maybe they're trying
to send somebody a message.

540
00:34:59,724 --> 00:35:02,519
Burial rites are very serious
in Eastern Europe.

541
00:35:02,977 --> 00:35:03,895
Could be to humiliate them.

542
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:05,647
How do you know all this?

543
00:35:06,106 --> 00:35:08,149
My folks were from Poland.

544
00:35:15,323 --> 00:35:16,574
Where?

545
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:17,993
You sure it was a knife?

546
00:35:18,451 --> 00:35:20,704
Really?

547
00:35:24,749 --> 00:35:26,459
There was another murder on...

548
00:35:26,918 --> 00:35:28,670
8th Avenue in a hotel.

549
00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:30,630
A stabbing.

550
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:33,216
Clerk said
a Russian rented the room.

551
00:35:33,675 --> 00:35:35,927
Mind if I go along with you?

552
00:35:36,386 --> 00:35:39,264
This isn't afire.
There's nothing foryou to do.

553
00:35:39,723 --> 00:35:42,058
I'll watch you.
Maybe I'll learn something.

554
00:35:42,517 --> 00:35:43,727
This isn't
homicide school, kid.

555
00:35:44,185 --> 00:35:47,022
But if you want to help,
take that.

556
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,773
What's this?

557
00:35:49,232 --> 00:35:51,526
The matching set
for the murder weapon.

558
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,826
This is our second day
in America.

559
00:36:00,285 --> 00:36:01,953
First day was very exciting...

560
00:36:02,412 --> 00:36:04,247
full of thrills and chills.

561
00:36:04,706 --> 00:36:08,168
Over here is the co-star
of my new movie.

562
00:36:08,626 --> 00:36:10,587
My partner Emil.

563
00:36:11,046 --> 00:36:13,298
Who's this?

564
00:36:13,757 --> 00:36:15,467
That is New York'sfinest.

565
00:36:15,925 --> 00:36:17,802
That's his case.

566
00:36:21,389 --> 00:36:22,724
Is that all you want?

567
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:26,603
Do you know how much killer
getsfor movie rights?

568
00:36:27,062 --> 00:36:28,229
It says in there
he wants a million.

569
00:36:28,688 --> 00:36:30,315
A million?

570
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:31,983
You're kidding.

571
00:36:32,442 --> 00:36:35,904
The killer gets million dollars
for television interview?

572
00:36:36,363 --> 00:36:38,531
It pays to be a killer
in this country.

573
00:36:43,953 --> 00:36:46,831
-Just taking a bath.
-Any ID?

574
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:50,251
-P.D. only.
-He's OK.

575
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:51,836
We still got
to run some prints.

576
00:36:52,295 --> 00:36:56,007
This kid here from Midtown
caught the case.

577
00:36:56,466 --> 00:36:58,718
How you doing?
Tommy Cullen.

578
00:36:59,177 --> 00:37:00,345
It's a pleasure
tofinally meet you.

579
00:37:00,804 --> 00:37:03,098
This is what we got.
Figure she's a prostitute.

580
00:37:03,556 --> 00:37:05,850
Judging from the defence wounds
on her arms and hands...

581
00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:07,852
she was really fighting
for her life.

582
00:37:08,311 --> 00:37:12,232
The room was registered
to a Frank Capra.

583
00:37:12,691 --> 00:37:15,318
-Who said this guy's Russian?
-The clerk.

584
00:37:15,777 --> 00:37:17,612
Check the switchboard.
See what calls went out.

585
00:37:18,071 --> 00:37:19,656
I'm on it.
Excuse me, gentlemen.

586
00:37:20,115 --> 00:37:22,492
We're waiting on the M.E.
tofind out if she was raped.

587
00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:23,994
We got a shitload
of prints here...

588
00:37:24,452 --> 00:37:25,954
but in this joint,
they could be anybody's.

589
00:37:26,413 --> 00:37:31,876
Anybody take a piss lately?
Check the toilet seat.

590
00:37:32,335 --> 00:37:35,046
Only one guy checked in?

591
00:37:43,096 --> 00:37:44,889
You want to go
to homicide school?

592
00:37:45,348 --> 00:37:46,808
Let me show you something.

593
00:37:47,267 --> 00:37:49,853
The killer was standing
over there, slashing her.

594
00:37:50,311 --> 00:37:51,855
At the point of death,
the heart stops beating...

595
00:37:52,313 --> 00:37:54,774
so you don't bleed anymore.
See these two marks?

596
00:37:55,233 --> 00:37:59,696
Somebody was over here while
the killer was stabbing her.

597
00:38:00,155 --> 00:38:02,657
What kind of knife you think
we're talking about here?

598
00:38:03,116 --> 00:38:07,078
If you look at the marks
on the wall over here...

599
00:38:07,537 --> 00:38:09,497
they're wide,
but notvery deep.

600
00:38:09,956 --> 00:38:12,500
This was not your everyday
kitchen or pocketknife.

601
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:14,252
What if the tipwas broken off?

602
00:38:14,711 --> 00:38:16,629
Could be. Then we'd probably
find it somewhere.

603
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,298
I thinkwe already found it.

604
00:38:18,757 --> 00:38:22,093
There was only one phone call
made last night.

605
00:38:22,552 --> 00:38:24,012
I dialled it,
and it was an escort service.

606
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:27,432
-You identify yourself?
-I'm new, not stupid.

607
00:38:27,891 --> 00:38:30,769
Call communications.
Get an address on that number.

608
00:38:34,022 --> 00:38:36,691
-Good work.
-Thanks.

609
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,693
So you gonna head over
to the escort service?

610
00:38:39,152 --> 00:38:41,071
I'll let you know what happens.

611
00:38:41,529 --> 00:38:43,573
Eddie, you the man, bro!

612
00:38:44,032 --> 00:38:45,116
Eddie, this is ridiculous.

613
00:38:45,575 --> 00:38:48,161
If I ride along with you,
we could talk over the case.

614
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,955
Tell you what.
I'll bounce this coin.

615
00:38:51,414 --> 00:38:52,582
If you win,you come with me.

616
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:53,792
If you don't win,
you don't come with me.

617
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:55,585
Fair enough?

618
00:38:56,044 --> 00:38:57,754
All right, but I call it.

619
00:38:58,213 --> 00:38:59,839
You call it.

620
00:39:03,426 --> 00:39:05,261
-Tails.
-Heads. You lose.

621
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,640
That's bullshit.
I didn't get to see.

622
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:10,934
Go ahead. I'll call it.

623
00:39:11,393 --> 00:39:15,021
Heads.
See? You lost twice.

624
00:39:18,274 --> 00:39:20,235
See you around.

625
00:39:21,861 --> 00:39:23,446
Come on.

626
00:39:23,905 --> 00:39:25,740
All right.

627
00:39:36,459 --> 00:39:37,711
That supposed to be funny?

628
00:39:38,169 --> 00:39:40,672
Yeah, come on.

629
00:39:42,674 --> 00:39:43,508
I was just joking.

630
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:45,135
Thanks for letting me
come along.

631
00:39:45,802 --> 00:39:47,429
No problem. Souvenir.

632
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:50,765
Two heads.

633
00:39:51,224 --> 00:39:52,183
Better than one.

634
00:39:52,642 --> 00:39:55,228
Police. We just want to
ask you some questions.

635
00:39:55,687 --> 00:39:56,563
Do you have a warrant?

636
00:39:57,022 --> 00:39:58,523
We're not looking
to bust you, ma'am.

637
00:39:58,982 --> 00:40:00,734
It's Detective Eddie Flemming
from Homicide.

638
00:40:01,192 --> 00:40:03,278
Just open the door.
We want to talk.

639
00:40:03,737 --> 00:40:05,363
My God,what an honour.

640
00:40:05,822 --> 00:40:07,991
Rose Hearn.
Please come in.

641
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:11,411
I just saw you on television.

642
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:14,414
You look better in real life.

643
00:40:14,873 --> 00:40:16,875
Just give me one second.

644
00:40:26,843 --> 00:40:29,346
So,what can I help
you with, Detective?

645
00:40:29,804 --> 00:40:31,056
We don't have any ID yet...

646
00:40:31,514 --> 00:40:33,892
but we found one of your girls
at the King Edward Hotel.

647
00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:36,603
What?

648
00:40:37,062 --> 00:40:38,396
Did you send anybody over there?

649
00:40:38,855 --> 00:40:42,275
Yeah. Honey.

650
00:40:42,734 --> 00:40:45,570
She's one of my girls.
She's dead?

651
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:46,655
I'm afraid so.

652
00:40:47,113 --> 00:40:48,740
Oh, my God.

653
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:51,117
Are you all right?

654
00:40:51,576 --> 00:40:53,328
-Do you want some water?
-Please.

655
00:40:53,787 --> 00:40:55,330
Get some water, please.

656
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:56,623
Do you know
what she was doing there?

657
00:40:57,082 --> 00:41:00,126
She was on a date
with a guy.

658
00:41:00,585 --> 00:41:03,088
He called asking for
a Czechoslovakian girl.

659
00:41:03,546 --> 00:41:04,839
I sent him Honey.

660
00:41:05,298 --> 00:41:07,258
Once they get there,
it doesn't really matter.

661
00:41:07,717 --> 00:41:08,426
Do you have Czech girls
working for you?

662
00:41:08,885 --> 00:41:13,139
No, but he insisted on one.

663
00:41:13,598 --> 00:41:15,975
Does this girl
look familiar to you?

664
00:41:20,105 --> 00:41:21,731
Linda?

665
00:41:28,613 --> 00:41:29,698
What were you saying?

666
00:41:30,156 --> 00:41:32,826
I think I know this girl.
Her name is Daphne.

667
00:41:33,284 --> 00:41:34,244
She's a Czech girl.

668
00:41:34,703 --> 00:41:36,079
I tried to recruit her
and gave her my card.

669
00:41:36,538 --> 00:41:39,916
I never heard backfrom her.
She's very popular suddenly.

670
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:41,376
Do you have a last name?

671
00:41:41,835 --> 00:41:46,840
No. I just had two guys come in
asking about her.

672
00:41:47,298 --> 00:41:48,466
Who were they?

673
00:41:48,925 --> 00:41:52,470
One guy said he was her cousin
was trying tofind her.

674
00:41:52,929 --> 00:41:55,974
They had a video camera,
and I wanted them out...

675
00:41:56,433 --> 00:41:57,434
so I told them where she worked.

676
00:41:57,892 --> 00:41:58,560
Where's that?

677
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:00,562
It's a salon
on 63rd and Madison.

678
00:42:01,021 --> 00:42:04,941
-What's the name?
-Ludwig's. She washes hair.

679
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:10,697
Leon, Ludwig's Hair Salon.
Suspects might be there.

680
00:42:11,156 --> 00:42:12,365
We think
the suspects are there.

681
00:42:12,824 --> 00:42:13,491
-Right away!
-Hurry!

682
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:15,118
Want a sip?

683
00:42:15,577 --> 00:42:17,746
-I'm on duty.
-So am l.

684
00:42:37,474 --> 00:42:39,100
Hunting for Daphne.

685
00:42:42,854 --> 00:42:44,522
I'll go inside.
You cover the exit.

686
00:42:44,981 --> 00:42:45,857
Of course.

687
00:42:46,316 --> 00:42:48,443
I always wanted to be a cop...

688
00:42:48,902 --> 00:42:50,111
when I was a kid.

689
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:52,072
I dreamt about
pulling out my gun...

690
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:54,908
kicking the door in,
yelling "Freeze"!

691
00:42:56,785 --> 00:42:57,952
What did you dream about?

692
00:42:58,411 --> 00:43:00,413
Running into a burning building,
kicking down the door...

693
00:43:00,872 --> 00:43:02,874
rushing through the smoke,
and saving a kid.

694
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:05,627
Then I guess we're doing it
the right way.

695
00:43:06,086 --> 00:43:08,838
If it was a burning building,
I'd let you gofirst.

696
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,675
Watch out.

697
00:43:14,052 --> 00:43:15,303
Fuck.

698
00:43:15,762 --> 00:43:18,056
The thrill of the hunt.

699
00:43:23,895 --> 00:43:25,772
Excuse me.

700
00:43:26,231 --> 00:43:27,357
Sorry.

701
00:43:27,816 --> 00:43:28,775
I'm looking for Daphne.

702
00:43:29,234 --> 00:43:31,861
I don't know where she went.
Maybe infront.

703
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,822
Thanks.

704
00:44:00,015 --> 00:44:01,725
I've got a temper.

705
00:44:02,183 --> 00:44:04,602
When I lose it,
I lose control.

706
00:44:05,061 --> 00:44:07,772
Get out of here!

707
00:44:08,231 --> 00:44:09,858
I didn't intend to kill Milos.

708
00:44:10,317 --> 00:44:13,403
When I went to prison,
they beat me.

709
00:44:13,862 --> 00:44:16,906
I still didn't tell
he was my partner.

710
00:44:17,365 --> 00:44:19,701
I loved Milos like a brother.

711
00:44:21,161 --> 00:44:24,080
Daphne,will you
be coming back to work?

712
00:44:24,539 --> 00:44:27,083
-In a minute, Ludwig.
-Come!

713
00:44:27,542 --> 00:44:29,878
Thank you.

714
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:32,672
I don't want to kill you.

715
00:44:33,131 --> 00:44:35,675
But if you talk...

716
00:44:36,134 --> 00:44:38,386
I will.

717
00:44:42,223 --> 00:44:45,477
I thought you'd want it.

718
00:44:45,935 --> 00:44:47,604
This was Tamina's necklace.

719
00:44:48,063 --> 00:44:50,106
Keep it.

720
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,986
Let's get out of here.

721
00:45:00,325 --> 00:45:01,951
Good-bye, my love.

722
00:45:17,926 --> 00:45:19,761
Your name's Daphne, right?

723
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,639
Remember last night at the fire,
you saw me?

724
00:45:23,098 --> 00:45:25,225
Last night,you wanted
to tell me something.

725
00:45:25,684 --> 00:45:27,936
I got it.
I smell smoke across the street.

726
00:45:28,395 --> 00:45:29,229
We just want to talk to you.

727
00:45:29,688 --> 00:45:31,982
We're here to protect you.
No problem.

728
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,317
You speak English?

729
00:45:34,776 --> 00:45:37,529
You speak English, don't you?

730
00:45:37,988 --> 00:45:39,614
Let's go this way.

731
00:45:45,203 --> 00:45:47,872
Did two guys come
and visit you today?

732
00:45:52,085 --> 00:45:54,170
What's that?
Who gave you this?

733
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,724
Across the street,
two guys with a video camera.

734
00:46:06,182 --> 00:46:07,767
Don't look! It's OK.

735
00:46:08,226 --> 00:46:09,519
Let's just box them in.

736
00:46:09,978 --> 00:46:11,187
You stay here with her.

737
00:46:13,648 --> 00:46:15,567
Come on, let's go!

738
00:46:30,206 --> 00:46:32,917
Shit! Go!

739
00:46:36,671 --> 00:46:38,548
Goddamn!

740
00:46:41,676 --> 00:46:42,969
Split up!

741
00:46:43,428 --> 00:46:45,347
Fuck! Go!

742
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:49,726
Son of a bitch!

743
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:56,733
Get the fuck out of the road!

744
00:47:04,741 --> 00:47:07,118
Move! Damn!

745
00:47:08,536 --> 00:47:10,246
On the bus!

746
00:47:21,549 --> 00:47:22,759
-Look out!
-Be careful!

747
00:47:27,389 --> 00:47:30,141
Excuse me! Move! I'm a cop!

748
00:47:48,493 --> 00:47:49,452
Look, look!

749
00:47:49,911 --> 00:47:51,371
Watch out! Watch out!

750
00:47:55,417 --> 00:47:57,669
Perfect! Cut! Print! Go!

751
00:48:03,842 --> 00:48:05,176
Bobby,you OK?

752
00:48:05,635 --> 00:48:08,096
I'm all right.
They went towards the park!

753
00:48:09,347 --> 00:48:11,558
-You hit?
-No.

754
00:48:12,017 --> 00:48:15,979
Got my piece.

755
00:48:36,082 --> 00:48:38,293
Did you get him?

756
00:48:40,211 --> 00:48:41,838
Think so.

757
00:48:46,968 --> 00:48:47,927
I'm here, Leon.

758
00:48:48,386 --> 00:48:49,971
I'm having a bad day, man.

759
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:52,015
You'll be OK.

760
00:48:54,184 --> 00:48:55,894
We've surrounded the park.
They've disappeared.

761
00:48:57,937 --> 00:48:59,314
Detective, can you tell us
what happened?

762
00:48:59,773 --> 00:49:01,900
-I can't talk right now.
-Give me a break.

763
00:49:02,359 --> 00:49:04,694
Excuse me,what's
the Fire Marshal doing here?

764
00:49:05,153 --> 00:49:06,529
I can't give out any statements
right now. I'm sorry.

765
00:49:06,988 --> 00:49:08,657
I understand your partner,
Leon Jackson, is injured.

766
00:49:09,115 --> 00:49:10,742
He was hurt, not seriously.

767
00:49:11,201 --> 00:49:12,535
Do you have a suspect
in custody?

768
00:49:12,994 --> 00:49:14,579
Now's not a good time, OK?

769
00:49:15,038 --> 00:49:15,622
Detective Jackson
was not hurt seriously.

770
00:49:16,081 --> 00:49:17,123
That's all I can tell you.

771
00:49:17,582 --> 00:49:19,084
All right.
Eddie, are you all right?

772
00:49:19,542 --> 00:49:21,086
Not a good time.

773
00:49:21,544 --> 00:49:23,171
All right.

774
00:49:25,799 --> 00:49:27,634
If you'd just be willing
to cooperate...

775
00:49:28,093 --> 00:49:29,511
Let me tell you something.

776
00:49:29,969 --> 00:49:32,389
I want to know who they are
and how you're involved now!

777
00:49:32,847 --> 00:49:34,474
I don't know who they are.
I've never seen them before.

778
00:49:34,933 --> 00:49:37,560
I was there showering,
and Tamina is a friend of mine.

779
00:49:38,019 --> 00:49:39,104
My shower was broken,
so she let me use theirs.

780
00:49:39,562 --> 00:49:40,730
Go on.

781
00:49:41,189 --> 00:49:42,524
That's it.
I saw the killings.

782
00:49:42,983 --> 00:49:44,067
Why are you protecting them?

783
00:49:44,526 --> 00:49:45,819
I'm protecting myself.

784
00:49:46,277 --> 00:49:48,446
From what?
Are you here illegally?

785
00:49:48,905 --> 00:49:50,365
Don't worry about that.
We'll talk to lmmigration.

786
00:49:50,824 --> 00:49:53,243
-Don't talk to lmmigration.
-Why not?

787
00:49:53,702 --> 00:49:55,537
We'll find out
one way or another.

788
00:49:55,996 --> 00:49:58,790
Better that it comes from you.
You understand?

789
00:50:08,425 --> 00:50:09,509
You want to sit down?

790
00:50:09,968 --> 00:50:11,594
Why don't you sit down?

791
00:50:14,681 --> 00:50:16,599
You want a glass of water?

792
00:50:29,779 --> 00:50:32,991
My little sister and I
shared a flat.

793
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:38,121
I came home one night,
and a man was raping her.

794
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:41,750
His gun was on the chair,
and I grabbed it...

795
00:50:42,208 --> 00:50:45,170
and when he came at me,
I shot him.

796
00:50:45,628 --> 00:50:46,713
Justifiable homicide.

797
00:50:47,172 --> 00:50:50,008
Yes, but he was a cop.

798
00:50:50,467 --> 00:50:53,553
So you shot him,
and you killed a cop?

799
00:50:54,012 --> 00:50:57,098
I was living in a small town
in Slovakia.

800
00:50:57,557 --> 00:50:58,558
We don't want to hear
your life story.

801
00:50:59,017 --> 00:51:00,477
I got an officer
shot out there.

802
00:51:00,935 --> 00:51:02,020
Just tell us where
we can find these guys.

803
00:51:02,479 --> 00:51:04,356
You're a cop.
I know you won't help me.

804
00:51:04,814 --> 00:51:07,067
You're right.
Not unless you help us.

805
00:51:07,525 --> 00:51:11,363
Eddie, can I talk to you
alone for a second?

806
00:51:11,821 --> 00:51:13,281
For a second.

807
00:51:19,746 --> 00:51:23,041
Even if she is telling
the truth, she's fucked.

808
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:27,212
Would you mind letting me
talk to her first?

809
00:51:27,671 --> 00:51:29,839
Any leads I get,
they're all yours...

810
00:51:30,298 --> 00:51:32,676
but let me
get first crack at her.

811
00:51:33,134 --> 00:51:35,261
You want to talk to her alone?

812
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:36,680
She's scared.

813
00:51:37,138 --> 00:51:39,140
You're intimidating her.
Big hotshot celebrity.

814
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,726
I'm a nobody.
Maybe she'll open upwith me.

815
00:51:42,185 --> 00:51:43,478
Maybe she looks
at me different.

816
00:51:43,937 --> 00:51:46,398
What is this?
You're her saviour?

817
00:51:46,856 --> 00:51:48,900
Gonna save her
from the burning building?

818
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:50,986
I'm being serious here.

819
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,369
I'll give you a head start...

820
00:51:59,828 --> 00:52:00,745
but you get her
to the station house...

821
00:52:01,204 --> 00:52:02,080
and don't let her
out of your sight.

822
00:52:02,539 --> 00:52:03,873
She's the only warm body
we got left.

823
00:52:04,332 --> 00:52:06,209
I'm a professional,
all right?

824
00:52:06,668 --> 00:52:07,919
Women like that have a way...

825
00:52:08,378 --> 00:52:10,672
of turning professionals
into amateurs.

826
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:39,242
What are you doing?

827
00:52:39,701 --> 00:52:41,619
I've got to light
this scene better.

828
00:52:42,078 --> 00:52:43,455
Make it more dramatic...

829
00:52:43,913 --> 00:52:46,583
just like in the movie,
"Silence of the Sheeps."

830
00:52:47,042 --> 00:52:48,626
Shut up.

831
00:52:49,085 --> 00:52:50,712
Hurts, huh?

832
00:53:01,973 --> 00:53:04,601
Big enough?
Just kidding.

833
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:06,686
Want to get married?

834
00:53:10,065 --> 00:53:12,067
I love you.
You want to get married?

835
00:53:12,525 --> 00:53:13,526
Sweetheart.

836
00:53:13,985 --> 00:53:15,612
No?

837
00:53:17,197 --> 00:53:18,365
Come on.

838
00:53:19,741 --> 00:53:21,284
Come on.

839
00:53:37,801 --> 00:53:39,761
I love you.

840
00:53:41,054 --> 00:53:43,765
sweetheart, my love.

841
00:53:45,725 --> 00:53:47,769
I adore you.

842
00:53:49,145 --> 00:53:51,690
I adore you, my Nicolette.

843
00:53:53,817 --> 00:53:55,485
I want you.

844
00:54:04,411 --> 00:54:06,788
I adore you.

845
00:54:10,959 --> 00:54:12,335
She's here.

846
00:54:12,794 --> 00:54:14,421
She's here?

847
00:54:20,552 --> 00:54:22,554
What does that mean?

848
00:54:25,056 --> 00:54:26,266
"Good luck" in Greek.

849
00:54:26,725 --> 00:54:28,810
Good luck in English.

850
00:54:32,939 --> 00:54:34,566
Are you married?

851
00:54:36,818 --> 00:54:38,653
Do you live alone?

852
00:54:40,697 --> 00:54:42,615
I haven't showered
since the killings.

853
00:54:43,074 --> 00:54:45,493
We could stop at your place,
and I could take a shower...

854
00:54:45,952 --> 00:54:48,330
before we have to go back
to custody.

855
00:54:48,788 --> 00:54:50,790
Look, l...

856
00:54:51,249 --> 00:54:54,544
I can't take you
back to my place.

857
00:54:55,003 --> 00:54:56,755
Then somewhere else?

858
00:55:00,008 --> 00:55:01,634
How's it going, dude?

859
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:06,139
-Eddie, how are you?
-Not too good.

860
00:55:17,734 --> 00:55:19,861
I love you.

861
00:55:20,278 --> 00:55:22,364
You have a funny way
of showing it.

862
00:55:22,822 --> 00:55:24,282
Yeah, me, too.

863
00:55:24,741 --> 00:55:25,909
Why'd you snap at me?

864
00:55:26,368 --> 00:55:27,327
I didn't snap at you.

865
00:55:27,786 --> 00:55:30,038
Yes,you did.
I just wanted a statement.

866
00:55:30,497 --> 00:55:31,414
I just can't answeryou
every time.

867
00:55:31,873 --> 00:55:33,041
I couldn't do it.

868
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,419
Didn't have to embarrass me
infront of my colleagues.

869
00:55:36,878 --> 00:55:40,090
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to embarrass you.

870
00:55:40,548 --> 00:55:41,216
You know that.

871
00:55:41,675 --> 00:55:43,176
It's all right.

872
00:55:45,512 --> 00:55:47,138
You OK?

873
00:55:58,066 --> 00:56:01,569
You got blood all over
your watch. Leon's?

874
00:56:02,028 --> 00:56:04,197
Probably. It has to be.

875
00:56:06,908 --> 00:56:09,327
Is he gonna be all right?

876
00:56:09,786 --> 00:56:12,580
He'll be OK.

877
00:56:14,207 --> 00:56:16,167
Last week,you had
that schoolteacher's blood...

878
00:56:16,626 --> 00:56:18,586
on your shoes.

879
00:56:19,045 --> 00:56:22,173
I don't know how you do it.

880
00:56:25,301 --> 00:56:26,344
Speaking of shoes...

881
00:56:26,803 --> 00:56:29,139
you know what I was thinking?

882
00:56:31,057 --> 00:56:35,353
I would like to have...

883
00:56:39,149 --> 00:56:41,276
some shoes next to my shoes.

884
00:56:46,197 --> 00:56:47,407
Wait.

885
00:56:47,866 --> 00:56:49,784
What are you doing, Eddie?

886
00:57:10,221 --> 00:57:12,307
Forget the phone. What?

887
00:57:12,766 --> 00:57:14,225
No, go ahead.
Answer the phone.

888
00:57:14,684 --> 00:57:16,311
Aw, shit.

889
00:57:18,396 --> 00:57:19,981
Look, can I just
call you right back?

890
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,733
You can't call me back.
We can't find Katie.

891
00:57:22,192 --> 00:57:24,319
We want you to anchor right now.
We don't know where she is.

892
00:57:24,778 --> 00:57:26,613
Come down, get in a cab,
and be here in an hour.

893
00:57:27,072 --> 00:57:28,531
Wait a minute.
Now? Right now?

894
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:29,741
You want your shot?

895
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,826
Get in the cab
and come down here now.

896
00:57:36,748 --> 00:57:38,083
They want me to anchor.

897
00:57:38,541 --> 00:57:40,085
-Great.
-Tonight.

898
00:57:40,543 --> 00:57:42,712
-That's great.
-Oh, my God.

899
00:57:45,715 --> 00:57:49,177
Forget that for a second.

900
00:57:49,636 --> 00:57:50,929
No,when you come back.

901
00:57:51,388 --> 00:57:52,514
You promise?
We'll talk tonight?

902
00:57:52,972 --> 00:57:54,182
Of course I promise.

903
00:57:54,641 --> 00:57:56,184
I'll see you
when you come back...

904
00:57:56,643 --> 00:57:57,268
and we'll do it.

905
00:57:57,727 --> 00:57:59,020
Go ahead.
You'll be great.

906
00:57:59,479 --> 00:58:00,647
I love you, Eddie.

907
00:58:01,106 --> 00:58:03,233
I love you, sweetheart.

908
00:58:07,028 --> 00:58:08,405
I'll see you tonight.

909
00:58:08,863 --> 00:58:11,241
Good luck.

910
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:13,785
Don't be late.

911
00:58:52,824 --> 00:58:55,035
The video of Milos and Tamina...

912
00:58:55,493 --> 00:58:56,786
I told you to erase it.

913
00:58:57,245 --> 00:58:59,581
I erased everything.
It's all gone.

914
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:02,834
Don't lie.
I won't be angry.

915
00:59:04,794 --> 00:59:07,088
Why not?

916
00:59:15,055 --> 00:59:17,265
-What is it?
-What does it look like?

917
00:59:17,724 --> 00:59:18,558
It's an address book.

918
00:59:19,017 --> 00:59:21,811
I took it from the black cop.

919
00:59:24,731 --> 00:59:26,066
What's this?

920
00:59:27,901 --> 00:59:29,944
What is it?

921
00:59:40,705 --> 00:59:45,251
"Eddie Flemming."

922
00:59:50,882 --> 00:59:53,885
Why won't you be angry
at me for keeping my movie?

923
00:59:57,806 --> 00:59:59,724
You'll see.

924
01:00:01,101 --> 01:00:03,770
Come. Bring the camera.

925
01:00:11,861 --> 01:00:13,071
Hello.

926
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:17,575
My name is Frank Capra.
I'm a famous Hollywood director.

927
01:00:22,539 --> 01:00:24,207
There she is!

928
01:00:41,808 --> 01:00:43,226
What are you doing here?

929
01:00:43,685 --> 01:00:45,353
What am I doing here?

930
01:00:45,812 --> 01:00:47,772
I came to see how
the investigation is going.

931
01:00:48,231 --> 01:00:49,441
I called,
and you're not here.

932
01:00:49,899 --> 01:00:50,984
I waited by the station house,
you never show up.

933
01:00:51,443 --> 01:00:52,986
I beep you,
you don't return my call.

934
01:00:53,445 --> 01:00:56,614
Where the hell have you been?

935
01:00:57,073 --> 01:00:59,492
Ladder 21 was at the rock
for training. All right?

936
01:00:59,951 --> 01:01:01,661
So we stopped there so
she could get cleaned up.

937
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:03,455
What do you mean cleaned up?

938
01:01:04,956 --> 01:01:05,915
I let her take a shower.

939
01:01:06,374 --> 01:01:09,169
A shower?
And did you take one, too?

940
01:01:09,627 --> 01:01:11,087
Come on, Chief.

941
01:01:11,546 --> 01:01:12,964
She's been through a lot.
I'm trying to help her out.

942
01:01:13,423 --> 01:01:14,257
Really?
That's really nice of you.

943
01:01:14,716 --> 01:01:15,675
You take a homicide witness...

944
01:01:16,134 --> 01:01:17,677
to take a shower after
your partner's been shot.

945
01:01:18,136 --> 01:01:19,721
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

946
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:21,514
You having that much trouble
get ting dates?

947
01:01:21,973 --> 01:01:23,767
I told him to.
Tommy, get her out of here.

948
01:01:24,225 --> 01:01:25,560
There was the press
all over the place.

949
01:01:26,019 --> 01:01:27,479
I didn't want her face
in the news, so I told him...

950
01:01:27,937 --> 01:01:29,147
to take her someplace quiet
till things calmed down.

951
01:01:29,606 --> 01:01:31,733
-Really?
-It was my decision, not his.

952
01:01:32,192 --> 01:01:33,526
I am
the Deputy Chief Fire Marshal...

953
01:01:33,985 --> 01:01:36,154
and every now and then, I like
to be included in decisions.

954
01:01:36,613 --> 01:01:38,198
I understand.
Infact, once he briefs me...

955
01:01:38,657 --> 01:01:40,200
you guys can take over
the press conference...

956
01:01:40,659 --> 01:01:41,785
and you can take
the lead in the case.

957
01:01:42,243 --> 01:01:44,120
-How's that?
-All right.

958
01:01:44,579 --> 01:01:46,623
I'm ready to be briefed.

959
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:49,793
-Excuse us.
-Sure.

960
01:01:50,251 --> 01:01:52,087
Are you ready to brief me?

961
01:01:52,545 --> 01:01:54,255
Good.

962
01:01:57,217 --> 01:01:59,177
Wait.

963
01:02:02,972 --> 01:02:04,808
Fellas, can you give us
a few minutes, please?

964
01:02:05,266 --> 01:02:07,310
-You bet.
-Thanks.

965
01:02:08,728 --> 01:02:09,562
Shut that door, too,
when you go out.

966
01:02:10,021 --> 01:02:11,648
Thanks a lot, guys.

967
01:02:13,066 --> 01:02:15,235
Just so you know,
I didn't touch her.

968
01:02:15,694 --> 01:02:16,861
Maybe you should've...

969
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:18,488
because nobody believes
you didn't, including me.

970
01:02:18,947 --> 01:02:20,073
I know it wasn't
the smartest thing to do...

971
01:02:20,532 --> 01:02:21,700
and you think I'm a fool,
but nothing happened.

972
01:02:22,158 --> 01:02:23,284
It wasn't
the smartest thing to do.

973
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:25,537
To say the least,
you ought to know better.

974
01:02:25,996 --> 01:02:28,498
She's got the potential
to fucking hang you.

975
01:02:28,957 --> 01:02:30,583
If she even suggests
that you made a pass at her...

976
01:02:31,042 --> 01:02:31,918
it's fucking over.
Deny it all you want.

977
01:02:32,377 --> 01:02:33,837
It won't make a fucking
bit of difference.

978
01:02:34,295 --> 01:02:37,090
You never went
out on a limb for somebody?

979
01:02:37,549 --> 01:02:38,967
"Here's the name of
an immigration lawyer."

980
01:02:39,426 --> 01:02:40,677
That's how you go out on a limb.

981
01:02:41,136 --> 01:02:42,178
If you heard her story,
you'd believe her, too.

982
01:02:42,637 --> 01:02:44,597
You'll jeopardize
your career and your life...

983
01:02:45,056 --> 01:02:46,516
and my case...

984
01:02:46,975 --> 01:02:48,643
and I'll give you
another piece of advice.

985
01:02:49,102 --> 01:02:49,978
Maybe you don't watch TV...

986
01:02:50,437 --> 01:02:52,188
but I'll let you in
on a little secret.

987
01:02:52,647 --> 01:02:54,149
The whole fucking world
watches television.

988
01:02:54,607 --> 01:02:56,568
When you go out there,
they know your face...

989
01:02:57,027 --> 01:02:59,571
and the little fucking
itty bit of fame...

990
01:03:00,030 --> 01:03:02,615
I have in this fucking city
makes my job a lot easier...

991
01:03:03,074 --> 01:03:05,076
and I get a lot more done
because of it.

992
01:03:05,535 --> 01:03:07,620
Why'd you stand up
for me with the chief?

993
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,669
I don't know.

994
01:03:15,128 --> 01:03:17,047
You remind me of a puppy
I used to have...

995
01:03:17,505 --> 01:03:20,675
who pissed all over the carpet,
but I still kept him.

996
01:03:37,567 --> 01:03:39,486
-Let's go.
-Captain!

997
01:03:41,363 --> 01:03:43,281
One at a time, please!

998
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:47,452
We're looking for two male white
suspects in their thirties.

999
01:03:47,911 --> 01:03:50,914
We believe them to be of
an Eastern-European nationality.

1000
01:03:54,584 --> 01:03:55,877
That's another lesson.

1001
01:03:56,336 --> 01:03:58,755
You got nothing to say,
don't waste their time or yours.

1002
01:03:59,214 --> 01:04:00,882
Let somebody else do that.

1003
01:04:01,341 --> 01:04:02,550
What's the plan now?

1004
01:04:03,009 --> 01:04:05,011
You're on the team, so I'll
call you when something happens.

1005
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:07,138
Right now I've got to propose
to my girlfriend.

1006
01:04:07,597 --> 01:04:09,891
Really? Congratulations.

1007
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:12,811
Don't congratulate me.
She hasn't said yes yet.

1008
01:04:13,269 --> 01:04:14,813
I still think
there's something...

1009
01:04:15,271 --> 01:04:17,482
I could be doing
to helpfind these guys.

1010
01:04:17,941 --> 01:04:20,402
Go home and get some rest.

1011
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:22,028
Sometimes you can try too hard.

1012
01:04:22,487 --> 01:04:24,531
Sometimes you have to go away
in order to come back.

1013
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:26,658
Like you did
with that shot today?

1014
01:04:27,117 --> 01:04:27,909
That's right.

1015
01:04:28,368 --> 01:04:29,744
All right. I get it.

1016
01:04:30,203 --> 01:04:32,205
Good, because you don't
look like you get it.

1017
01:04:32,664 --> 01:04:33,707
I get it.

1018
01:04:34,165 --> 01:04:35,709
-Sure you get it?
-I get it.

1019
01:04:36,167 --> 01:04:37,711
-You get it?
-No, I get it.

1020
01:04:38,169 --> 01:04:41,506
Trust me. I get it.

1021
01:04:44,175 --> 01:04:45,051
Why don't you keep it?

1022
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:48,304
Don't say I never
gave you anything.

1023
01:06:11,346 --> 01:06:12,973
Coming.

1024
01:06:31,533 --> 01:06:33,159
Hello?

1025
01:07:14,951 --> 01:07:16,411
I'm looking for Gayle Cassiopi.

1026
01:07:18,246 --> 01:07:19,873
I think it's one flight up.

1027
01:07:20,332 --> 01:07:22,459
Thanks.

1028
01:07:31,343 --> 01:07:32,969
Action.

1029
01:08:29,317 --> 01:08:30,360
Who's she?

1030
01:08:30,819 --> 01:08:32,904
None of your fucking business.

1031
01:08:37,242 --> 01:08:38,994
Who's Nicky?

1032
01:08:52,674 --> 01:08:53,842
Beautiful.

1033
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:55,927
It's OK.

1034
01:09:05,145 --> 01:09:08,231
You know what I need?
I need your opinion.

1035
01:09:08,690 --> 01:09:10,567
You do? About what?

1036
01:09:15,030 --> 01:09:16,740
You see...

1037
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:20,702
they're going to make
a movie about me, too, Eddie...

1038
01:09:21,161 --> 01:09:22,620
and write books.

1039
01:09:23,079 --> 01:09:25,832
Write books.

1040
01:09:27,334 --> 01:09:30,170
Books? What's your fucking
accomplishment?

1041
01:09:32,339 --> 01:09:36,676
I kill someone famous.

1042
01:09:38,428 --> 01:09:46,394
And I saw you on the page
of "People" magazine.

1043
01:09:46,853 --> 01:09:48,271
Eddie, look at me.

1044
01:09:48,730 --> 01:09:51,858
Good.

1045
01:09:52,317 --> 01:09:55,195
Good. Be tough to the end.

1046
01:09:55,654 --> 01:09:58,782
Actor who plays you will
want you to die like a hero.

1047
01:10:01,117 --> 01:10:04,204
Tabloids don't have
to do re-enactments.

1048
01:10:04,663 --> 01:10:08,375
They're going to have
a real movie this time.

1049
01:10:08,833 --> 01:10:11,503
You film killing me,
you'll get away with that?

1050
01:10:13,463 --> 01:10:14,714
You're stupider than I thought.

1051
01:10:15,173 --> 01:10:17,384
Both out of your fucking minds.

1052
01:10:21,596 --> 01:10:25,016
Turn it off!

1053
01:10:31,314 --> 01:10:32,941
We are insane.

1054
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:38,154
Who else but crazy men
would film their crimes?

1055
01:10:38,613 --> 01:10:42,450
So I kill you,
and if we are caught...

1056
01:10:42,909 --> 01:10:44,327
we are sent
to mental hospital...

1057
01:10:44,786 --> 01:10:49,332
but once I'm in the hospital,
I say I'm not crazy...

1058
01:10:49,791 --> 01:10:51,835
just pretending.

1059
01:10:52,293 --> 01:10:54,879
So I would be acquitted.

1060
01:10:55,338 --> 01:10:57,090
We see psychiatrists.

1061
01:10:57,549 --> 01:11:00,051
They must certify we are sane...

1062
01:11:00,510 --> 01:11:03,179
and because of
your double jeopardy law...

1063
01:11:03,638 --> 01:11:06,016
we can't be tried
for the same crime twice.

1064
01:11:06,474 --> 01:11:10,353
We come out
free, rich, and famous.

1065
01:11:10,812 --> 01:11:14,232
This is a fucking great idea.

1066
01:11:14,691 --> 01:11:16,526
You think the jury
will buy that bullshit?

1067
01:11:16,985 --> 01:11:18,820
You sickfucks.

1068
01:11:36,546 --> 01:11:39,341
I'm smarter than Americans.

1069
01:11:40,842 --> 01:11:44,095
You watch crybaby talk shows
all day long.

1070
01:11:47,390 --> 01:11:52,270
Not only will Americans
believe me, they'll cry for me.

1071
01:12:01,154 --> 01:12:05,450
Would you like to say
good-bye to your Nicky?

1072
01:12:05,909 --> 01:12:09,496
Maybe you can
propose to her now.

1073
01:12:16,419 --> 01:12:19,089
He has nothing to say.

1074
01:12:19,547 --> 01:12:20,840
Give me a pillow.

1075
01:12:22,509 --> 01:12:24,469
Give me a fucking pillow!

1076
01:12:30,558 --> 01:12:32,352
Come here, start the camera.

1077
01:12:32,811 --> 01:12:35,355
Cut!
This is my project.

1078
01:12:35,814 --> 01:12:38,108
I'm the director,
and I say action.

1079
01:12:38,566 --> 01:12:40,235
Shut the fuck up!

1080
01:14:36,977 --> 01:14:37,978
Detective Flemming...

1081
01:14:38,436 --> 01:14:40,855
was one of the most
decorated NYPD detectives...

1082
01:14:41,314 --> 01:14:42,607
in the history of New York.

1083
01:14:43,066 --> 01:14:44,901
Among the several thousand
arrests he made...

1084
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:48,029
during his career,
the famed Stephen Geller case.

1085
01:14:48,488 --> 01:14:50,657
He was widely loved
by the community he served.

1086
01:14:51,116 --> 01:14:52,701
His partner eulogized him.

1087
01:14:53,159 --> 01:14:54,744
Eddie was my mentor...

1088
01:14:56,830 --> 01:14:58,581
My partner...

1089
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:02,460
Tragedy.
Every great film must have one.

1090
01:15:02,919 --> 01:15:04,963
...the word "friend."

1091
01:15:06,923 --> 01:15:09,009
I will miss him.

1092
01:15:34,034 --> 01:15:35,160
I said, no!

1093
01:15:35,618 --> 01:15:38,038
No means no.
Want me to get ugly?

1094
01:15:38,496 --> 01:15:40,332
Gentlemen, I'm sorry.
It's a private affair.

1095
01:15:40,790 --> 01:15:43,335
-Sorry, no.
-Let me get a drink.

1096
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:19,806
Please hold.

1097
01:17:20,265 --> 01:17:23,518
Just stay on. Hold on.
Robert, you've got a call.

1098
01:17:23,977 --> 01:17:25,186
What the hell
are you doing here?

1099
01:17:25,645 --> 01:17:27,480
Hold on. I'm right here.
Just stay right there.

1100
01:17:27,939 --> 01:17:28,857
Don't be ridiculous.
Can't you see I'm busy here?

1101
01:17:29,316 --> 01:17:30,567
Trust me. Take this call.

1102
01:17:31,026 --> 01:17:32,027
Hang up the phone,
go get yourself a drink.

1103
01:17:32,485 --> 01:17:34,404
Take the call.

1104
01:17:34,863 --> 01:17:36,364
Give it to me.

1105
01:17:37,824 --> 01:17:39,451
I'm sorry.

1106
01:17:42,037 --> 01:17:43,455
Who is this?

1107
01:17:43,913 --> 01:17:47,208
I made a movie
of Eddie Flemming's murder.

1108
01:17:51,421 --> 01:17:52,756
How do I know this is you?

1109
01:17:53,214 --> 01:17:54,466
You'll know when you meet me.

1110
01:17:54,924 --> 01:17:58,011
-Where?
-Come to 35th and Broadway.

1111
01:17:58,470 --> 01:17:59,929
Don't bring the police.
Come alone...

1112
01:18:00,388 --> 01:18:01,598
oryou'll be in my next film.

1113
01:18:02,057 --> 01:18:04,601
Listen, asshole, I've been
threatened by better than you.

1114
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:07,228
No. I'm the best
that's ever threatened you.

1115
01:18:07,687 --> 01:18:08,813
They're gonna get you.

1116
01:18:09,272 --> 01:18:12,150
We'll talk about that.

1117
01:18:12,609 --> 01:18:13,777
About surrendering?

1118
01:18:14,235 --> 01:18:17,155
4.00. It gives you
time to go to bank.

1119
01:18:17,614 --> 01:18:20,158
$1 million.

1120
01:18:23,328 --> 01:18:25,872
"Top Story,"
are you still there?

1121
01:18:26,331 --> 01:18:27,415
I'm here.

1122
01:18:27,874 --> 01:18:29,167
It doesn't work that way.

1123
01:18:29,626 --> 01:18:31,503
If you don't want my film...

1124
01:18:31,961 --> 01:18:35,882
I'll call another show,
and they will show it.

1125
01:18:41,972 --> 01:18:43,473
I'll meet you.
I need two things from you--

1126
01:18:43,932 --> 01:18:47,394
I want exclusivity,
and you will surrender to me.

1127
01:18:50,146 --> 01:18:51,648
Bring cash.

1128
01:18:58,154 --> 01:18:59,990
Let's go.

1129
01:19:04,327 --> 01:19:06,705
Truck 21 spotted on
the north end of the building...

1130
01:19:07,163 --> 01:19:08,707
put the aerial ladder
up to the roof.

1131
01:19:09,165 --> 01:19:11,292
Engine company 54
and Engine 9...

1132
01:19:11,751 --> 01:19:13,878
took hand lines
up to the second level.

1133
01:19:14,337 --> 01:19:16,923
The they cut a hole in the roof
directly over the fire.

1134
01:19:17,382 --> 01:19:20,218
-So how was the funeral?
-Not good.

1135
01:19:20,677 --> 01:19:22,637
Did the D.A.
video-tape her deposition?

1136
01:19:23,096 --> 01:19:24,431
He finished a little while ago.

1137
01:19:24,889 --> 01:19:26,016
Swing by her apartment...

1138
01:19:26,474 --> 01:19:28,310
pick up her clothes,
and take her straight to INS.

1139
01:19:28,768 --> 01:19:30,687
She's their problem now.

1140
01:20:08,016 --> 01:20:11,102
Hard to believe. Watch.

1141
01:20:59,442 --> 01:21:00,276
What's this?

1142
01:21:00,735 --> 01:21:01,987
I don't know.

1143
01:21:04,364 --> 01:21:05,699
"Good luck with
all your troubles.

1144
01:21:06,157 --> 01:21:08,827
"I'm here if you need me.
Ludwig."

1145
01:21:11,538 --> 01:21:12,831
Who's he?

1146
01:21:13,289 --> 01:21:17,168
My boss.
Why, are you jealous?

1147
01:21:19,546 --> 01:21:21,840
Why don'twe get your stuff?

1148
01:21:49,576 --> 01:21:51,703
Look...

1149
01:21:52,162 --> 01:21:54,873
you're a witness
to a double homicide.

1150
01:21:55,332 --> 01:21:57,667
All right?
I can't get involved with you.

1151
01:22:01,087 --> 01:22:02,881
All right?

1152
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:07,385
Why don't you go get your bags,
and I'll wait here.

1153
01:22:07,844 --> 01:22:09,763
Are you all right?

1154
01:22:10,221 --> 01:22:12,807
I'm fine.

1155
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:30,283
Get back!

1156
01:22:34,037 --> 01:22:35,413
That's not mine!

1157
01:22:45,215 --> 01:22:46,800
Get back!

1158
01:22:52,681 --> 01:22:54,307
Don't do it!

1159
01:22:57,769 --> 01:22:59,562
Come on!

1160
01:23:02,357 --> 01:23:05,276
Hurry!

1161
01:23:10,699 --> 01:23:12,325
-It's locked.
-Where's the key?

1162
01:23:12,784 --> 01:23:13,785
-It's not mine.
-All right.

1163
01:23:14,244 --> 01:23:15,620
Get in the bathroom.

1164
01:23:20,125 --> 01:23:22,335
1075. 47th and 8th!

1165
01:23:22,794 --> 01:23:24,963
All right. We're trapped!
Two alarms on arrival!

1166
01:23:27,132 --> 01:23:29,301
Oh, my God.

1167
01:23:29,759 --> 01:23:31,636
He's nailed it down.

1168
01:23:32,095 --> 01:23:34,973
Baby, don't open the window.
It'll suck the fire towards us.

1169
01:23:41,438 --> 01:23:44,316
-They were here.
-Jesus Christ, that's Eddie's.

1170
01:23:44,774 --> 01:23:46,151
They were here!

1171
01:23:46,609 --> 01:23:49,612
Calm down, Daphne.
Just get in the tub.

1172
01:23:50,989 --> 01:23:52,240
-There's gasoline.
-What?

1173
01:23:52,699 --> 01:23:53,908
There's gasoline in here.

1174
01:23:54,367 --> 01:23:56,536
-What are you doing?
-I'm pouring it out.

1175
01:23:56,995 --> 01:23:58,997
-It's not going down.
-Oh, my God.

1176
01:24:02,792 --> 01:24:04,127
Give it to me.

1177
01:24:05,628 --> 01:24:06,921
Jesus Christ.
It's clogged. God damn it.

1178
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:09,466
Please do something.
We're going to die.

1179
01:24:11,259 --> 01:24:12,427
Forget it.
They're all clogged.

1180
01:24:12,886 --> 01:24:16,765
Come on, baby.
Just stay low and stay calm.

1181
01:24:49,297 --> 01:24:52,884
90% people who die in a fire
die from eating smoke.

1182
01:24:53,343 --> 01:24:55,470
Let me introduce you
to my partner...

1183
01:24:55,929 --> 01:24:58,306
and the man
who started the fire.

1184
01:25:02,811 --> 01:25:05,105
Say something for your fans.

1185
01:25:10,151 --> 01:25:12,529
Stand back and get down!
Just get back and stay low.

1186
01:25:15,115 --> 01:25:16,866
Stay low!

1187
01:25:28,086 --> 01:25:30,380
This'll buy us some time!

1188
01:25:47,897 --> 01:25:50,358
Get back!

1189
01:25:55,655 --> 01:25:56,948
This is a great film.

1190
01:25:57,407 --> 01:26:01,244
We can see fire right now,
and Daphne's in the fire.

1191
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:10,462
Tell him it's OK.

1192
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:18,762
Let's go!

1193
01:26:39,115 --> 01:26:40,742
Come on, guys. Let's go.

1194
01:26:41,201 --> 01:26:43,328
Get that plug now!

1195
01:26:58,051 --> 01:26:59,803
Take care of the boy.

1196
01:27:01,429 --> 01:27:03,556
And get her some oxygen!

1197
01:27:09,270 --> 01:27:11,690
You all right?
What the hell happened up there?

1198
01:27:12,148 --> 01:27:14,693
It was a setup. Somebody
booby-trapped the apartment.

1199
01:27:15,151 --> 01:27:17,362
-Who?
-It's gotta be the same guys.

1200
01:27:17,821 --> 01:27:20,240
You gotta speak louder.
I can't hearyou.

1201
01:27:20,699 --> 01:27:21,908
Jordy, are you hurt?

1202
01:27:22,367 --> 01:27:23,243
-I'm all right.
-What?

1203
01:27:23,702 --> 01:27:25,954
You have to speak up.

1204
01:27:26,413 --> 01:27:28,790
What the hell
are you talking about?

1205
01:27:29,249 --> 01:27:32,002
What is it?

1206
01:27:41,553 --> 01:27:42,554
We have a disturbance
in the lobby.

1207
01:27:43,013 --> 01:27:44,472
-Where's Hawkins?
-He's not on the premises.

1208
01:27:44,931 --> 01:27:47,183
Go get that tape
and bring it here right now.

1209
01:27:47,642 --> 01:27:48,810
Any request for that
video-tape has to go to--

1210
01:27:49,269 --> 01:27:52,230
Woman, I am begging you!
You can't let this happen!

1211
01:27:52,689 --> 01:27:54,065
You want that tape,
contact the at torney.

1212
01:27:54,524 --> 01:27:55,150
I'll be happy to give you--

1213
01:27:55,608 --> 01:27:57,068
You thinkwe're joking?

1214
01:27:59,446 --> 01:28:02,240
Listen,you can't do this!
Don't do this to Eddie.

1215
01:28:02,699 --> 01:28:04,159
Don't do it to
the people of this city.

1216
01:28:04,617 --> 01:28:06,119
You can't show
the man's murder on TV!

1217
01:28:06,578 --> 01:28:09,039
You want the tape, there it is!

1218
01:28:11,708 --> 01:28:13,918
Stay tuned for a special edition
of "Top Story."

1219
01:28:14,377 --> 01:28:15,670
Detective Eddie Flemming's
brutal murder...

1220
01:28:16,129 --> 01:28:18,923
has been video-taped,
and we will broadcast it...

1221
01:28:19,382 --> 01:28:20,800
after these messages.

1222
01:28:21,259 --> 01:28:23,678
Hard to believe. Watch.

1223
01:28:45,700 --> 01:28:47,661
Who says you can't be
success in America?

1224
01:28:48,119 --> 01:28:52,874
I came here with nothing,
knowing nobody, and now, look.

1225
01:28:54,876 --> 01:28:56,336
I am success story.

1226
01:29:01,883 --> 01:29:04,177
Why did you say "I"?

1227
01:29:04,636 --> 01:29:06,638
-It should be "we."
-Don't be paranoid.

1228
01:29:07,097 --> 01:29:08,640
I gave you half of
what they gave me.

1229
01:29:09,099 --> 01:29:09,933
Good evening.
I'm Robert Hawkins...

1230
01:29:10,392 --> 01:29:11,267
and this is "Top Story."

1231
01:29:11,726 --> 01:29:13,353
-Here we are.
-Tonight I present to you...

1232
01:29:13,812 --> 01:29:15,230
material of a graphic
and violent nature...

1233
01:29:15,689 --> 01:29:17,899
never before seen
on television...

1234
01:29:18,358 --> 01:29:20,777
and I do so with a heavy heart.

1235
01:29:21,236 --> 01:29:22,320
It would only be normal
to askwhy.

1236
01:29:22,779 --> 01:29:24,823
Why are we showing something
so disturbing?

1237
01:29:25,281 --> 01:29:27,617
And my answer
is as a journalist...

1238
01:29:28,076 --> 01:29:29,577
I am obligated to show it.

1239
01:29:30,036 --> 01:29:32,580
I air this tape
in loving memory...

1240
01:29:33,039 --> 01:29:34,332
of my friend Eddie Flemming.

1241
01:29:34,791 --> 01:29:37,460
Hard to believe.

1242
01:29:39,963 --> 01:29:41,047
Watch.

1243
01:29:41,506 --> 01:29:46,219
You film killing me,
you're gonna get away with that?

1244
01:29:46,678 --> 01:29:48,555
Just turn it off.

1245
01:29:49,014 --> 01:29:50,890
Cut! This is my project.

1246
01:29:51,349 --> 01:29:53,560
I'm the director,
and I say action.

1247
01:29:54,019 --> 01:29:55,562
Shut the [beep] up!

1248
01:30:30,847 --> 01:30:32,807
Why did you leave that stuff in
about you being a director?

1249
01:30:33,266 --> 01:30:35,310
-Because I am the director.
-What?

1250
01:30:35,769 --> 01:30:37,479
Don't you fucking realize
if it wasn't for me...

1251
01:30:37,937 --> 01:30:42,233
for my idea, no fucking way
we'd be sitting here right now?

1252
01:30:42,692 --> 01:30:44,611
-Your idea?
-My idea.

1253
01:30:45,070 --> 01:30:46,863
Is that the guy?

1254
01:30:48,281 --> 01:30:49,324
Don't you understand?

1255
01:30:49,783 --> 01:30:52,118
This is a greatAmerican movie,
and who made it?

1256
01:30:52,577 --> 01:30:54,037
I made it all.
I was the director.

1257
01:30:54,496 --> 01:30:56,289
-Who are you?
-Everything.

1258
01:30:56,748 --> 01:30:58,625
I am everything.

1259
01:30:59,084 --> 01:31:00,710
This is whatAmerica wants--
violence and sex.

1260
01:31:01,169 --> 01:31:03,630
Before we hand in
the nextvideo...

1261
01:31:04,089 --> 01:31:05,882
I'm gonna put titles on it...

1262
01:31:06,341 --> 01:31:10,553
and my credit is going to read,
"Directed by Oleg Razgul."

1263
01:31:11,012 --> 01:31:13,723
Yeah, but there is
only one problem.

1264
01:31:14,182 --> 01:31:16,643
One credit,
but I don't share credit.

1265
01:31:17,102 --> 01:31:18,979
-You got it?
-Share credit?

1266
01:31:19,437 --> 01:31:20,897
You think you're a director?

1267
01:31:21,356 --> 01:31:27,404
You're just a little,
small, Russian piece of shit.

1268
01:31:30,407 --> 01:31:31,741
Let's go!

1269
01:31:43,795 --> 01:31:45,755
This is Robert Hawkins
for "Top Story."

1270
01:31:46,214 --> 01:31:48,675
We'll be back after this.

1271
01:31:49,134 --> 01:31:51,219
All right, I'm here.
Oh,Jesus.

1272
01:31:51,678 --> 01:31:53,096
This is the man
I told you about.

1273
01:31:53,555 --> 01:31:55,724
This is Bruce Cutler.

1274
01:31:57,100 --> 01:31:58,101
Bryan, come get this from here.

1275
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:01,521
I am Emil. I'm insane.

1276
01:32:01,980 --> 01:32:03,690
Are you my lawyer?

1277
01:32:04,149 --> 01:32:05,108
Not just yet.

1278
01:32:05,567 --> 01:32:07,610
I got your money.

1279
01:32:13,408 --> 01:32:14,993
Where is it?

1280
01:32:15,452 --> 01:32:17,454
Shit,where is it?

1281
01:32:17,912 --> 01:32:18,830
Where is it?!

1282
01:32:19,289 --> 01:32:21,124
He's got the camera!
He's got the movie!

1283
01:32:21,583 --> 01:32:22,459
Let's sit down
and talk a minute.

1284
01:32:22,917 --> 01:32:24,336
I need it! Where is it?

1285
01:32:24,794 --> 01:32:25,503
Don't move!

1286
01:32:25,962 --> 01:32:28,048
Get your hands up
and drop the gun!

1287
01:32:28,506 --> 01:32:30,342
Drop the goddamn gun!

1288
01:32:32,844 --> 01:32:34,012
What did you hit him for?
He surrendered!

1289
01:32:34,471 --> 01:32:36,723
-Go tight on them.
-He's unarmed and hurt!

1290
01:32:37,182 --> 01:32:38,141
I'm going with you.

1291
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:39,559
Come on!

1292
01:32:40,018 --> 01:32:41,186
I'm coming down there with you.

1293
01:32:41,645 --> 01:32:42,604
I'm his lawyer--

1294
01:32:43,063 --> 01:32:44,064
Turn the camera off!

1295
01:32:44,522 --> 01:32:47,275
Keep going! Keepfilming!

1296
01:32:47,734 --> 01:32:49,527
I'm invoking his rights!

1297
01:32:49,986 --> 01:32:50,820
What's going on?

1298
01:32:51,279 --> 01:32:52,113
I'm going with you.

1299
01:32:52,572 --> 01:32:53,823
Fuck!

1300
01:32:54,282 --> 01:32:55,325
I'm going down there with you.

1301
01:32:55,784 --> 01:32:56,951
What's going on?!

1302
01:32:57,410 --> 01:32:58,703
They're taking you downtown.

1303
01:32:59,162 --> 01:33:01,373
-Whoa! I'll take him.
-He's mine!

1304
01:33:01,831 --> 01:33:02,666
I'm taking him.
Don't argue with me.

1305
01:33:03,124 --> 01:33:04,751
-He's my collar!
-He killed my partner!

1306
01:33:05,210 --> 01:33:07,003
After he's booked, he's yours,
but I'm walking him in!

1307
01:33:07,462 --> 01:33:09,422
All right, kid,
have your 15 minutes.

1308
01:33:09,881 --> 01:33:13,134
Tommy, ride with him.
Get in the fucking car.

1309
01:33:13,593 --> 01:33:15,303
Don't speak to him!

1310
01:33:16,972 --> 01:33:17,889
Put your head in!

1311
01:33:18,348 --> 01:33:19,474
Get him in the car, Tommy!

1312
01:33:19,933 --> 01:33:21,434
Put your head in,you fool!

1313
01:33:21,893 --> 01:33:23,353
I ain't playing with you!
Shit!

1314
01:33:23,812 --> 01:33:26,648
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself!

1315
01:33:27,107 --> 01:33:28,358
Bullshit, Leon!

1316
01:33:28,817 --> 01:33:31,236
Ashamed of what?
I got him off the streets.

1317
01:33:31,695 --> 01:33:32,779
Bravo, Mr Hawkins!

1318
01:33:33,238 --> 01:33:34,990
You better back off.

1319
01:33:35,448 --> 01:33:36,533
You are sick!

1320
01:33:36,992 --> 01:33:37,993
I'm fed up with your bullshit!

1321
01:33:38,451 --> 01:33:40,161
Let go!

1322
01:33:43,581 --> 01:33:45,291
Get outta here!

1323
01:33:49,671 --> 01:33:53,216
Where are you going?
You'll lose everybody!

1324
01:33:53,675 --> 01:33:55,218
What are you doing, man?

1325
01:33:55,677 --> 01:33:57,012
This is not the way
to the station!

1326
01:34:10,358 --> 01:34:11,985
Talk to me!
You're losing them!

1327
01:34:12,444 --> 01:34:14,070
Answer me, man!

1328
01:34:41,556 --> 01:34:43,099
-Answer me!
-Where am l?

1329
01:34:43,558 --> 01:34:46,061
-What the hell--
-What's going on?

1330
01:34:46,519 --> 01:34:49,022
Hold on. Wait!

1331
01:34:49,481 --> 01:34:50,649
Come on!

1332
01:34:51,107 --> 01:34:53,276
Where's my lawyer?
Where are they?

1333
01:34:53,735 --> 01:34:55,111
God damn it!

1334
01:34:55,570 --> 01:34:58,114
What's wrong with you, man?
Shit!

1335
01:34:58,573 --> 01:35:00,909
Fuck you!
What's going on?

1336
01:35:01,368 --> 01:35:03,453
Jordy, listen!
Wait a minute!

1337
01:35:03,912 --> 01:35:05,163
You can't do this, man!

1338
01:35:05,622 --> 01:35:07,540
Listen! Wait,Jordy!

1339
01:35:10,126 --> 01:35:10,835
Come on.

1340
01:35:11,294 --> 01:35:12,545
Listen, man, please!

1341
01:35:13,004 --> 01:35:17,634
How'd you know how to rig
that apartment?

1342
01:35:18,093 --> 01:35:19,928
My father was a fireman.

1343
01:35:20,387 --> 01:35:22,931
He taught me about fire.
Now it's my friend.

1344
01:35:23,390 --> 01:35:25,016
-Take a walk.
-You're not thinking straight.

1345
01:35:25,475 --> 01:35:26,685
Don't you get it?
He knew he'd get caught.

1346
01:35:27,143 --> 01:35:28,436
That's why you video-taped
Eddie's murder!

1347
01:35:28,895 --> 01:35:30,522
I want to see
this son of a bitch dead, too--

1348
01:35:30,981 --> 01:35:32,107
It's over tonight,
you son of a bitch!

1349
01:35:32,565 --> 01:35:33,400
You can't kill him
in cold blood!

1350
01:35:33,858 --> 01:35:34,943
Get the hell outta here!

1351
01:35:35,402 --> 01:35:36,361
Get in the car!

1352
01:35:36,820 --> 01:35:40,490
Listen to me!
I'm not gonna let you do this!

1353
01:35:40,949 --> 01:35:43,118
Get in the car! Go!

1354
01:35:43,576 --> 01:35:44,536
Now go!

1355
01:35:44,995 --> 01:35:47,872
Fuck it, man! Shit!

1356
01:35:48,331 --> 01:35:50,333
Something fucking funny?

1357
01:35:50,792 --> 01:35:52,252
Refreshing.

1358
01:35:52,711 --> 01:35:54,963
You think this is funny?!

1359
01:35:55,422 --> 01:35:56,965
Turn around!

1360
01:35:57,424 --> 01:36:00,468
You want to be famous?
You want headlines?

1361
01:36:02,095 --> 01:36:03,471
Now's your chance.

1362
01:36:03,930 --> 01:36:05,056
Put your hands up.

1363
01:36:05,515 --> 01:36:07,684
Get your goddamn hands up!

1364
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:11,271
Turn around.

1365
01:36:11,730 --> 01:36:13,523
You want to be
a real American, right?

1366
01:36:13,982 --> 01:36:14,733
You want to be a tough guy?

1367
01:36:15,191 --> 01:36:18,528
Here's Eddie's gun.
You remember him?

1368
01:36:24,451 --> 01:36:25,285
Come on.

1369
01:36:25,744 --> 01:36:27,537
You want to be famous?
Shoot me.

1370
01:36:27,996 --> 01:36:29,539
Want headlines?
Want to make money?

1371
01:36:29,998 --> 01:36:32,167
Want to be a celebrity?
Shoot me!

1372
01:36:34,377 --> 01:36:37,839
You can't kill me.
You're not a cop.

1373
01:36:38,298 --> 01:36:40,300
You're just a fireman
with a gun.

1374
01:36:43,219 --> 01:36:47,182
OK...l'll make it easy.

1375
01:37:03,907 --> 01:37:10,997
You Americans are pussies
without your missiles and money.

1376
01:37:11,456 --> 01:37:14,751
You won't kill me.

1377
01:37:15,210 --> 01:37:17,462
You don't have the balls.

1378
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:37,315
Don't do it, brother!

1379
01:37:37,774 --> 01:37:39,693
Kill me.

1380
01:37:40,151 --> 01:37:41,820
Get up!

1381
01:37:42,278 --> 01:37:44,364
You are mine now, sucker!

1382
01:37:44,823 --> 01:37:46,324
You are out of control,
you know that?

1383
01:37:46,783 --> 01:37:48,660
Here's Eddie's gun.

1384
01:37:50,370 --> 01:37:52,539
Where you going?

1385
01:37:52,998 --> 01:37:55,792
I lost my shoe.
I want my shoe.

1386
01:37:56,251 --> 01:37:58,211
Get him out of here!

1387
01:38:03,883 --> 01:38:07,554
Emil Slovak is a victim here.
He is not a culprit.

1388
01:38:08,013 --> 01:38:09,097
We all appreciate the tragedy...

1389
01:38:09,556 --> 01:38:11,349
of the death
of Detective Flemming.

1390
01:38:11,808 --> 01:38:13,226
I represent Mr Slovak.

1391
01:38:13,685 --> 01:38:16,896
He was operating under the undue
influence of his partner.

1392
01:38:17,355 --> 01:38:18,982
This will all come out
at the trial...

1393
01:38:19,441 --> 01:38:21,860
and Emil will be vindicated.
I will see to that.

1394
01:38:24,738 --> 01:38:26,573
-Good job.
-Thanks.

1395
01:38:27,032 --> 01:38:28,742
How you feeling?

1396
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:30,535
I brought letters.

1397
01:38:30,994 --> 01:38:32,620
Fan mail from women.

1398
01:38:33,079 --> 01:38:34,164
One wants to buy you a suit...

1399
01:38:34,622 --> 01:38:37,125
another one sent money,
and another one wants money.

1400
01:38:37,584 --> 01:38:39,544
-Bring me the cigarettes?
-I did.

1401
01:38:41,421 --> 01:38:45,258
The perception out there
is very bad, Emil, right now.

1402
01:38:45,717 --> 01:38:46,926
And perception is reality.

1403
01:38:47,385 --> 01:38:48,637
You may not be crazy...

1404
01:38:49,095 --> 01:38:50,138
but I want to get
that message out...

1405
01:38:50,597 --> 01:38:51,973
and I want to get it out now.

1406
01:38:52,432 --> 01:38:54,017
That's our only defence
in this case.

1407
01:38:54,476 --> 01:38:56,770
You have tofocus
on three things--

1408
01:38:57,228 --> 01:38:59,064
paranoia,fear, and delusions.

1409
01:38:59,522 --> 01:39:00,732
I was all of those.

1410
01:39:01,191 --> 01:39:04,653
But you never appreciated
the severity of it until now.

1411
01:39:05,111 --> 01:39:05,987
Of course not.
How could I be?

1412
01:39:06,446 --> 01:39:09,324
I was paranoid,
fear ful, and deluded.

1413
01:39:12,661 --> 01:39:14,287
Now...what about Oleg?

1414
01:39:14,746 --> 01:39:16,623
They're looking
all over for him.

1415
01:39:17,082 --> 01:39:19,542
Haven't found him.
Maybe he went back to Russia.

1416
01:39:20,001 --> 01:39:21,419
I don't know.

1417
01:39:21,878 --> 01:39:22,671
He's here.

1418
01:39:23,129 --> 01:39:24,297
Let'sforget about him
and focus on you.

1419
01:39:24,756 --> 01:39:26,549
You're what's most important.

1420
01:39:27,008 --> 01:39:31,012
What about my movie rights?
Book rights?

1421
01:39:31,471 --> 01:39:33,056
Foryou?

1422
01:39:33,515 --> 01:39:36,768
I have not thought
about that, Emil.

1423
01:39:37,227 --> 01:39:39,813
How much do you want?
What's your cut?

1424
01:39:41,314 --> 01:39:44,985
I thinkwe could be partners.
50-50.

1425
01:39:45,443 --> 01:39:47,070
No way.

1426
01:39:47,529 --> 01:39:48,822
I give you 30%, no more.

1427
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:50,448
Don't forget.
We're in it together.

1428
01:39:50,907 --> 01:39:52,200
I thought 40%
might be all right.

1429
01:39:52,659 --> 01:39:54,327
Oh, my God!

1430
01:39:54,786 --> 01:39:56,788
Thirty,
or I call another lawyer.

1431
01:39:57,247 --> 01:39:58,748
This is the biggest
case of your life.

1432
01:39:59,207 --> 01:40:02,335
Don't try to negotiate.
Say yes or no.

1433
01:40:07,590 --> 01:40:10,302
I can live with 30%,
but, Emil, it's important...

1434
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:13,179
you understand
this is not all about money.

1435
01:40:13,638 --> 01:40:14,806
What else do you need?

1436
01:40:15,265 --> 01:40:18,727
I need to know about you,
what makes you tick.

1437
01:40:19,185 --> 01:40:20,729
I need to know
about your background.

1438
01:40:21,187 --> 01:40:22,605
I need to know about
your mother,your father...

1439
01:40:23,064 --> 01:40:23,982
your brother,your sister,
everything.

1440
01:40:24,441 --> 01:40:26,985
That's what I need to know.

1441
01:40:28,820 --> 01:40:31,489
My father always degraded me.

1442
01:40:31,948 --> 01:40:32,949
He killed my self-esteem.

1443
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:37,162
He hated me from the day
when I was born.

1444
01:40:41,666 --> 01:40:44,210
Emil Slovak
will appear in court today.

1445
01:40:44,669 --> 01:40:45,879
His lawyer--

1446
01:40:46,338 --> 01:40:48,381
Stay focused. Start again.

1447
01:40:49,966 --> 01:40:52,385
Emil Slovak
will appear in court today.

1448
01:40:52,844 --> 01:40:57,474
His lawyer will argue that
his client is mentally unfit...

1449
01:40:57,932 --> 01:40:59,392
This is such bullshit.

1450
01:40:59,851 --> 01:41:03,813
In a related matter, Mr Slovak's
attorney Bruce Cutler...

1451
01:41:04,272 --> 01:41:07,275
famous for handling
sensational cases...

1452
01:41:07,734 --> 01:41:10,278
claims his client is
unfit to stand trial.

1453
01:41:10,737 --> 01:41:13,573
Bobby,want to give me
a break already?

1454
01:41:14,032 --> 01:41:16,159
Hello?
No, not you, hon.

1455
01:41:16,618 --> 01:41:18,787
Hello? No,
we have no comment.

1456
01:41:19,245 --> 01:41:21,748
...his partner Oleg Razgul,
who threatened to kill him...

1457
01:41:22,207 --> 01:41:23,166
if he didn't follow his orders.

1458
01:41:23,625 --> 01:41:26,127
I gotta go!

1459
01:41:26,586 --> 01:41:28,546
I'm going back to
the Czech Republic...

1460
01:41:29,005 --> 01:41:30,340
toface the charges against me.

1461
01:41:30,799 --> 01:41:32,008
I'm innocent.

1462
01:41:32,467 --> 01:41:33,969
If she shot a cop
who raped her sister...

1463
01:41:34,427 --> 01:41:36,638
in this country,
she'd be a hero.

1464
01:41:38,014 --> 01:41:39,349
And I approached him
and asked him...

1465
01:41:39,808 --> 01:41:41,434
for some spare change.
Politely, right?

1466
01:41:41,893 --> 01:41:44,354
Whereupon he pulls out
his big gun...

1467
01:41:44,813 --> 01:41:45,730
pushed me
all up in the tree...

1468
01:41:46,189 --> 01:41:48,358
hand cuffs me
like this up here...

1469
01:41:48,817 --> 01:41:50,235
and then he takes
my money, right?

1470
01:41:50,694 --> 01:41:51,987
Took my money and
left me here like this...

1471
01:41:52,445 --> 01:41:53,405
exposed to all the elements.

1472
01:41:53,863 --> 01:41:55,365
Un-fucking-believable.

1473
01:41:55,824 --> 01:41:57,283
Look at this fucking guy.

1474
01:41:57,742 --> 01:41:59,703
Kids, you know,
if you out there...

1475
01:42:00,161 --> 01:42:02,455
don't hate your firemen.

1476
01:42:02,914 --> 01:42:04,165
Not all Fire Marshals like this.

1477
01:42:04,624 --> 01:42:07,168
It's not like this,
so keep the love.

1478
01:42:10,005 --> 01:42:12,173
Hard to believe.
You're watching "Top Story."

1479
01:42:12,632 --> 01:42:14,175
How could you forget that
you hand cuffed a civilian...

1480
01:42:14,634 --> 01:42:16,344
to a fucking tree
in Central Park...

1481
01:42:16,803 --> 01:42:17,971
in the middle of the night?!
Tell me that!

1482
01:42:18,430 --> 01:42:20,348
Look, all right,
I know I screwed up...

1483
01:42:20,807 --> 01:42:22,350
but it's not like this guy
is some innocent civilian.

1484
01:42:22,809 --> 01:42:24,728
He'll end your career
and probably mine!

1485
01:42:25,186 --> 01:42:26,813
End my career?

1486
01:42:27,272 --> 01:42:29,190
What am I talking about?
The press will be all over us!

1487
01:42:29,649 --> 01:42:30,859
Get the fuck back to your desks!

1488
01:42:31,318 --> 01:42:33,153
Come on, Chief.
Look at my file.

1489
01:42:33,611 --> 01:42:35,530
I've never had a civilian
complaint against me before.

1490
01:42:35,989 --> 01:42:38,408
-I crack big cases.
-Your record doesn't matter!

1491
01:42:38,867 --> 01:42:39,784
It should mean something!

1492
01:42:40,243 --> 01:42:41,536
That's past history!
Don't you get it?

1493
01:42:41,995 --> 01:42:45,957
Look, I'm sorry.
It's unfortunate...

1494
01:42:46,416 --> 01:42:48,335
that I have to make decisions
based on your press coverage...

1495
01:42:48,793 --> 01:42:50,211
but that's what I gotta do.

1496
01:42:50,670 --> 01:42:55,050
You're suspended, without pay,
pending a department trial.

1497
01:42:55,508 --> 01:42:58,011
Not to mention
your criminal charges.

1498
01:42:58,470 --> 01:42:59,971
That's not right.

1499
01:43:00,430 --> 01:43:03,475
You better get yourself
a damn good lawyer.

1500
01:43:44,683 --> 01:43:47,018
...over a million dollars
for the disputed video.

1501
01:43:47,477 --> 01:43:51,147
In related news, Emil Slovak
is back in court tomorrow...

1502
01:43:51,606 --> 01:43:52,524
where we're expected to learn...

1503
01:43:52,983 --> 01:43:54,818
if he is competent
to stand trial.

1504
01:43:55,276 --> 01:43:58,530
Meanwhile, the massive manhunt
continuesfor Oleg Razgul...

1505
01:43:58,989 --> 01:44:00,490
the alleged mastermind
behind the murder...

1506
01:44:00,949 --> 01:44:02,617
of New York City Detective
Eddie Flemming.

1507
01:44:03,076 --> 01:44:05,870
"Action News" has learned that
Mr Slovakwon't have to worry...

1508
01:44:06,329 --> 01:44:07,831
about how he is going
to pay for his defence.

1509
01:44:08,289 --> 01:44:09,457
He has received movie offers...

1510
01:44:09,916 --> 01:44:13,086
and has been in conversations
with numerous publishers...

1511
01:44:13,545 --> 01:44:15,505
concerning the rights
to his story.

1512
01:44:18,008 --> 01:44:19,384
Further developments
are expected today...

1513
01:44:19,801 --> 01:44:21,594
in the bizarre Eddie Flemming
murder case.

1514
01:44:22,053 --> 01:44:24,097
Judge Stanley Stern
will issue his ruling...

1515
01:44:24,556 --> 01:44:27,475
on alleged killer
Emil Slovak's insanity plea.

1516
01:44:27,934 --> 01:44:28,935
If the court rules
in his favour today...

1517
01:44:29,394 --> 01:44:31,896
Mr Slovakwill be
transferred to the psych ward...

1518
01:44:32,355 --> 01:44:33,773
at Rikers lsland
for further testing...

1519
01:44:34,232 --> 01:44:35,483
before being remanded
to the custody...

1520
01:44:35,942 --> 01:44:37,986
of a permanent institution
for the mentally ill.

1521
01:44:38,445 --> 01:44:40,572
Slovak's attorney Bruce Cutler
has maintained...

1522
01:44:41,031 --> 01:44:41,906
that an abusive childhood
is to blame...

1523
01:44:42,365 --> 01:44:43,283
for the actions of his client.

1524
01:44:43,742 --> 01:44:45,994
The Czech national
apparently has a history...

1525
01:44:46,453 --> 01:44:47,287
of physical
and emotional trauma...

1526
01:44:47,746 --> 01:44:50,373
heaped upon him
by an alcoholic father.

1527
01:44:59,382 --> 01:45:01,301
What's ever left over, keep it.

1528
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:03,178
Thanks, buddy.

1529
01:45:20,779 --> 01:45:22,989
Keep the Statue of Liberty
in the background, all right?

1530
01:45:23,448 --> 01:45:24,991
-How do I look?
-You look beautiful.

1531
01:45:25,450 --> 01:45:27,535
Thanks. Fuck you. Roll.

1532
01:45:27,994 --> 01:45:29,537
What are you looking at?

1533
01:45:30,955 --> 01:45:32,207
Forget about him.
Let's go.

1534
01:45:32,666 --> 01:45:34,334
All right. Just roll.

1535
01:45:38,213 --> 01:45:39,381
All right. Let's go.

1536
01:45:39,839 --> 01:45:41,967
Bruce Cutler,
do you have a statement for us?

1537
01:45:42,425 --> 01:45:44,552
It's been a difficult
and long day for us.

1538
01:45:45,011 --> 01:45:47,555
Emil has been found
incompetent to stand trial...

1539
01:45:48,014 --> 01:45:50,767
and in times
of extreme stress...

1540
01:45:51,226 --> 01:45:53,478
as a result of
his delusional thinking...

1541
01:45:53,937 --> 01:45:56,898
he could not appreciate
the wrong fulness of his acts...

1542
01:45:57,357 --> 01:46:00,026
and therefore he's not
liable for his acts.

1543
01:46:00,485 --> 01:46:03,905
This is a victory
for the mentally ill...

1544
01:46:04,364 --> 01:46:06,700
and before Emil
is taken on the boat...

1545
01:46:07,158 --> 01:46:10,412
to the psychiatric ward
at Rikers lsland...

1546
01:46:10,870 --> 01:46:12,706
it should be noted
that what he did...

1547
01:46:13,164 --> 01:46:14,541
he was forced to do...

1548
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:19,587
by Oleg Razgul, a dangerous
and demented individual...

1549
01:46:20,046 --> 01:46:21,172
who is at liberty right now...

1550
01:46:21,631 --> 01:46:24,467
in the streets of New York,
and both Emil and l...

1551
01:46:24,926 --> 01:46:27,846
Iook forward to when
he is brought to justice.

1552
01:46:29,389 --> 01:46:31,266
What the fuck are you
looking at,you piece of shit?

1553
01:46:31,725 --> 01:46:32,851
Officers,you have to watch him.

1554
01:46:33,310 --> 01:46:34,477
He's assaulted
my client in the past.

1555
01:46:34,936 --> 01:46:36,563
That's it? This scumbag
kills Eddie Flemming...

1556
01:46:37,022 --> 01:46:38,148
and now he gets to spend
the rest of his life...

1557
01:46:38,606 --> 01:46:39,858
in some country club nuthouse?

1558
01:46:40,317 --> 01:46:42,902
What about the victims and
the families and their rights?

1559
01:46:43,361 --> 01:46:45,363
Marshal, I understand
you don't agree...

1560
01:46:45,822 --> 01:46:48,575
but this is the system,
and this is the law.

1561
01:46:50,243 --> 01:46:51,077
Let's go.

1562
01:46:51,536 --> 01:46:53,621
I can kill you.
I'm insane.

1563
01:46:55,206 --> 01:46:57,334
We need this area cleared.
Move back.

1564
01:47:00,128 --> 01:47:01,171
...two-shot
of Cutler and Slovak.

1565
01:47:01,630 --> 01:47:02,505
All right.

1566
01:47:02,964 --> 01:47:04,215
Give me the boat
in the background.

1567
01:47:04,674 --> 01:47:05,884
Do you really believe
that your client is insane?

1568
01:47:06,343 --> 01:47:09,763
Emil knew exactly
what he was doing. Watch this.

1569
01:47:10,221 --> 01:47:12,015
All right.

1570
01:47:19,314 --> 01:47:20,190
Turn it off.

1571
01:47:20,649 --> 01:47:22,567
This tape I kept for myself.

1572
01:47:25,820 --> 01:47:27,947
In hospital
I say I'm not crazy...

1573
01:47:28,406 --> 01:47:30,617
and because of your
double jeopardy law...

1574
01:47:31,076 --> 01:47:33,411
we can't be tried for
the same crime twice.

1575
01:47:33,870 --> 01:47:36,957
We come out
free, rich, and famous.

1576
01:47:37,415 --> 01:47:40,085
Can we deal for this?

1577
01:47:44,255 --> 01:47:45,924
It'sfree.

1578
01:47:47,384 --> 01:47:48,927
What would you say
to evidence...

1579
01:47:49,386 --> 01:47:51,012
that proves your client
is not insane?

1580
01:47:51,471 --> 01:47:52,889
"Top Story" has
the truth right here...

1581
01:47:53,348 --> 01:47:54,849
from Oleg Razgul himself.

1582
01:47:55,308 --> 01:47:57,852
You knew what you were doing.

1583
01:47:58,311 --> 01:47:59,813
It's all in here...in my movie.

1584
01:48:00,271 --> 01:48:03,233
Officers, do your duty
and arrest this man!

1585
01:48:03,692 --> 01:48:05,777
I'm not the killer.
I'm the director. Action!

1586
01:48:13,159 --> 01:48:14,786
-Back off!
-Let her go!

1587
01:48:15,245 --> 01:48:17,706
Everyone, back away from me!

1588
01:48:18,164 --> 01:48:19,332
Hold your fire!
Do not fire your weapons!

1589
01:48:19,791 --> 01:48:20,750
Stay back!

1590
01:48:21,209 --> 01:48:22,085
Nobody's gonna fire.

1591
01:48:22,544 --> 01:48:23,503
-Hold that line!
-Let her go!

1592
01:48:23,962 --> 01:48:25,463
Tell him to put his gun down.

1593
01:48:25,922 --> 01:48:28,258
-All right.
-Get that shotgun out of here!

1594
01:48:28,717 --> 01:48:30,135
-Nobody's gonna fire.
-Stay back!

1595
01:48:30,593 --> 01:48:32,679
Everybody, get back!
Do not fire, anyone!

1596
01:48:33,138 --> 01:48:34,139
-Lower those weapons!
-Go tighter.

1597
01:48:34,597 --> 01:48:35,640
Now! Lower!

1598
01:48:36,099 --> 01:48:37,017
Tell him to put his gun down!

1599
01:48:37,475 --> 01:48:38,852
-Put your weapon down!
-Let her go!

1600
01:48:39,311 --> 01:48:40,520
If he doesn't lower his gun,
I'llfucking kill her!

1601
01:48:40,979 --> 01:48:42,731
-Officer, lower that weapon!
-Loweryour gun!

1602
01:48:43,189 --> 01:48:44,858
-Remember what he did to Eddie!
-Shut up!

1603
01:48:45,317 --> 01:48:46,234
Do not fire that weapon!

1604
01:48:46,693 --> 01:48:50,071
I'll surrender
if he lowers his gun.

1605
01:48:50,530 --> 01:48:52,699
Don't you let this
piece of shit surrender!

1606
01:48:53,158 --> 01:48:54,743
If you don't let me surrender,
I kill her now.

1607
01:48:55,201 --> 01:48:56,870
-I don't care!
-I kill her now.

1608
01:48:57,329 --> 01:48:58,288
Do not fire that weapon!

1609
01:48:58,747 --> 01:49:00,206
-Shut up!
-Take that shot.

1610
01:49:00,665 --> 01:49:02,334
God damn it!
You take that fucking shot!

1611
01:49:02,792 --> 01:49:05,837
Officer, for the last time,
lower your weapon!

1612
01:49:09,633 --> 01:49:11,885
Look, he's lowered the weapon.
Don't shoot her.

1613
01:49:12,344 --> 01:49:13,511
You take that shot.

1614
01:49:13,970 --> 01:49:17,766
He lowered his weapon.
You don't have to shoot her.

1615
01:49:18,224 --> 01:49:19,726
He lowered the weapon,
all right?

1616
01:49:37,452 --> 01:49:39,371
You're OK.
Don't look back.

1617
01:49:39,829 --> 01:49:42,123
Don't look at him.

1618
01:49:48,004 --> 01:49:51,341
Fuck! Did you get that?
Fuck!

1619
01:49:56,554 --> 01:49:58,139
Let's get you out of here.

1620
01:50:04,729 --> 01:50:06,106
Hey, boss.
He's still alive.

1621
01:50:06,564 --> 01:50:07,816
Come on. Let's go.

1622
01:50:51,234 --> 01:50:53,695
How was that?

1623
01:50:54,779 --> 01:50:56,364
That was great.

1624
01:51:17,427 --> 01:51:19,804
Thanks.

1625
01:51:25,852 --> 01:51:27,270
I thought you might want that.

1626
01:51:34,069 --> 01:51:35,945
Alan, here.
Take this camera.

1627
01:51:37,864 --> 01:51:38,865
Marshal.

1628
01:51:39,324 --> 01:51:41,368
Marshal,you feel up
to making a statement?

1629
01:51:41,826 --> 01:51:42,619
All right. Forget it.
No statement.

1630
01:51:43,078 --> 01:51:44,704
Cut the camera.
Listen, I can help you.

1631
01:51:45,163 --> 01:51:46,414
Take a lessonfrom Eddie.

1632
01:51:46,873 --> 01:51:48,166
The media can be
a powerful ally.

1633
01:51:53,213 --> 01:51:56,383
Eddie was my friend.
I'd like to be yours, too.

1634
01:52:19,197 --> 01:52:20,448
Good job.

1635
01:53:09,289 --> 01:53:11,166
-You OK?
-I'm fine. Fuck him.

1636
01:53:11,625 --> 01:53:14,377
Follow him walking away,
and then whip back to me.

1637
01:53:24,554 --> 01:53:26,681
We've been talking with
Fire Marshal Jordan Warsaw.

1638
01:53:27,140 --> 01:53:28,141
He's understandably
over whelmed...

1639
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:30,018
with what's just
occurred here today--

1640
01:53:30,477 --> 01:53:32,520
the tragic end
of two vicious psychopaths...

1641
01:53:32,979 --> 01:53:34,189
who attempted to manipulate
the news media...

1642
01:53:34,648 --> 01:53:36,274
for their own greed and egos.

1643
01:53:36,733 --> 01:53:38,777
We at "Top Story"
will never allow ourselves...

1644
01:53:39,235 --> 01:53:40,445
to be used in this way.

1645
01:53:40,904 --> 01:53:43,990
Our goal is to bring you
the news in all its complexity.

1646
01:53:44,449 --> 01:53:46,284
The truth was
the real hero here today...

1647
01:53:46,743 --> 01:53:47,994
and we're proud
to have brought it to you...

1648
01:53:48,453 --> 01:53:50,455
exclusively on "Top Story."

1649
01:53:50,914 --> 01:53:53,792
This is Robert Hawkins.
Good night.

1650
01:53:54,305 --> 01:54:00,822
