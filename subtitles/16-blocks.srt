00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:44,767
<i>This is Detective Jack Mosley.
Shield number 227.</i>

3
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:48,141
<i>I guess this will be
my last will and testament.</i>

4
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:50,373
<i>This is for Diane.</i>

5
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:55,413
<i>When this day is over, they're gonna come
and talk to you about this...</i>

6
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:59,786
<i>...and they're gonna... They're gonna
tell you what happened, Diane.</i>

7
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:03,053
<i>But what they tell you
is not really what happened here.</i>

8
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,198
<i>So I hope that you get this.</i>

9
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:11,995
<i>I was trying to do a good thing.</i>

10
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,781
Police! Get down! Everybody, down!

11
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,086
Down! Get down!

12
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:38,259
Go, go, go! Come on!

13
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:40,593
- Clear.
- Police. Get down.

14
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,132
Seal it off.

15
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,135
Agent 10-10, we're all secure.

16
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:47,663
All right, we're out of here.

17
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:49,331
It's clear.

18
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,671
You smell that?

19
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:05,051
Couple hours. We gotta move now.
Would you turn that thing off?

20
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:07,489
All right, who's downstairs
we don't need?

21
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,304
It's all yours. Good luck.

22
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:32,310
I hate to do this, Jack, but I need you
to sit on this until uniforms get here.

23
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,817
- All right.
- Just hang until you're relieved.

24
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,478
All right.

25
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:38,982
Don't touch anything.

26
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,824
Any word on the suspects?

27
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:01,234
- What do you want me to tell you?
- What did you tell them?

28
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,500
I saw someone out there.

29
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:05,605
Yeah, yeah. Come on.

30
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:15,748
- Anything for me?
- Breath mints.

31
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:19,824
Sergeant Cannova called.
Wants you to write up this wire request.

32
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,427
Said to make sure
you get the right dates on them.

33
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:26,190
The particulars are on your desk,
and he needs it by tonight.

34
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,227
All right.

35
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,834
All right, well, we can have an officer
come by about 8 a. m. Tomorrow.

36
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:46,747
You gave her two?

37
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:57,356
Well, you know, we do what we can.

38
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:03,993
Hey, Jack, I forgot to tell you,
the lieutenant's looking for you.

39
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,138
He wants you to find him right away.

40
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,767
Yeah, yeah.

41
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,639
Well, listen.
All right, well, I'll call you.

42
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,374
Hey, Mosley.

43
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,175
- Mosley.
- Yeah.

44
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,287
Grace tell you to find me?

45
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,425
- Yeah, just a minute ago.
- All right, need a favor.

46
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:29,220
Get this guy from lockup
and run him to Centre Street.

47
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:33,126
The DA needs him ASAP. He's gotta be
in front of a grand jury before 10.

48
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:35,894
I signed out.

49
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:37,797
You signed the sheet?

50
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:41,502
Well, not technically, no.
But I mean, I'm signed out.

51
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,266
Then consider yourself on overtime.

52
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,741
Captain Gruber called.
We need this thing done.

53
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,073
Don't you got some mutt
that takes care of this?

54
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:51,978
I got Keenan, but he's still on the verrazano.
He's behind some overturned truck.

55
00:05:56,556 --> 00:06:00,253
I'm tired. I mean, look, normally,
you know me, I don't say no.

56
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:02,417
I know you been
working all night, Jack...

57
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:05,189
...but who's the detective
and who's the lieutenant here?

58
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,629
I mean, Jack, I got nobody else.

59
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,734
It's a nothing thing.

60
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:13,360
One hundred and eighteen minutes
to get a little hemorrhoid 16 blocks.

61
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:18,408
I'll let you come in
to work late tomorrow.

62
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,269
Yeah, yeah.

63
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:50,934
Edward Bunker.

64
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,601
Yeah, that's me, officer.
Eddie Bunker, right here.

65
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,940
Down here, the last cell.

66
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:57,776
- Come back in an hour.
- What do you mean, come back?

67
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,077
He's supposed to wear a suit
when he leaves.

68
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,551
- And?
- It's not here yet.

69
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:05,122
Just get him out here, all right?

70
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,020
They said he'd wear a suit.

71
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:11,095
No, yeah, I'm supposed to get a suit.
It's a three-piece suit. It's gray.

72
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,663
It's got... Wait. Yeah.

73
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:15,824
It's a three-button, it's gray,
it's got cuffs on the pants.

74
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:18,835
They brought the catalog down.
I picked it out of the catalog.

75
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,973
I'm not supposed
to leave without it. Wait.

76
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,233
I'm not supposed to leave
without that suit.

77
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:27,072
- You tell it to him.
- No, that's why you brought my shoelaces.

78
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:29,043
- Come on, come on.
- I'm not supposed to.

79
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:32,184
- Yo, yo, you take the old lady, right?
- Yeah, you sure?

80
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,683
The old lady goes into the car,
otherwise she dies.

81
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:36,082
- You think so?
- Yeah, man.

82
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:40,021
That's what... I don't know. You gotta
figure out the answer for yourself.

83
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:43,856
Everybody just calm down.
Officer, I'm going to court.

84
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,657
- I'm supposed to have a suit.
- Hey.

85
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,027
Shut up. Here's your property.

86
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,465
- It's not a good sign.
- Hands behind your back.

87
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,797
- Hold on, I'm trying...
- Hands behind your back.

88
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:57,204
I don't even have my...
All my prop... Wait one minute.

89
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,336
It's not right.
They promised me the suit.

90
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,640
I picked it out of the catalog...
Wait, my book.

91
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,909
I can't leave without my book.
My book is very important to me.

92
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:09,115
Why are we rushing like this?
It's not a good sign.

93
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:11,313
- Hey.
- What's the damn answer?

94
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,857
- Hey!
- Shut up.

95
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:17,494
- I hate police.
- Half a tank.

96
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,295
You could have had
a little more patience.

97
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,837
This suit don't mean nothing to you.
You probably got a bunch of suits.

98
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,703
But it's a whole different thing to me.

99
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,016
These cars don't ever change, huh?

100
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:48,249
Traditional cruisers.

101
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:51,396
And the same retarded hump
in the middle.

102
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:55,861
Smell the same way,
like Lysol and vomit.

103
00:08:56,836 --> 00:09:00,169
I hope nobody vomited back here.
They probably did.

104
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,577
Hey, man, let me ask you something.

105
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,081
I'm trying to figure this out.

106
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,284
You driving along
in your hurricane, right?

107
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:19,822
There's three people at the bus stop.

108
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:23,018
Yeah, one is an old lady.
She's sick, she about to die.

109
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,790
The second one is your best friend.

110
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,093
He saved your life, right?

111
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:32,635
And the third is the girl of your dreams.

112
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:34,796
Right, but check it out...

113
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:39,267
...you only got space in the car
for one person.

114
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,480
Right? Who you take?

115
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:45,845
It's a riddle that's supposed to tell
what type of person you are...

116
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:47,610
...like where you at in your life.

117
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,347
It's a hypothetical question, man, damn.

118
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,855
It's just a hypothetical...

119
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:56,654
Well, good. Fine, good.
I guess that's my answer.

120
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,599
Why don't you get
on the loudspeaker?

121
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,640
<i>Put the Hawaii Five-0 light on
or something.</i>

122
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,938
Use your police power.
Put on a little siren.

123
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,910
Make room, make a hole.

124
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,949
Isn't that the saying,
"Make a hole, make a hole"?

125
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:22,243
Go on, make a hole.

126
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:31,092
Signs. Everywhere, signs, signs, signs.
All over, man.

127
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,758
I used to not even see
nothing like that, man.

128
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:38,370
And then I start seeing them.
And I start looking for them.

129
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,968
And everything just start falling in place.

130
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:46,209
I'm gonna be all right,
where I'm supposed to be.

131
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:50,409
I ain't got my suit,
but once they get my testimony...

132
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,949
...they drop my charges, I'm free.

133
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,552
It's making sense to me.

134
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,885
I believe in that.

135
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,717
Being in the right place.

136
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,724
Being where you supposed to be.
You believe in that?

137
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:04,886
I believe life's too long
and guys like you make it even longer.

138
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,200
Life's too long?

139
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,232
Damn.

140
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:17,336
That's some cold shit, man. I ain't never
heard nobody say no shit like that.

141
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,640
Usually you hear about people
trying to make their life longer, you know?

142
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:25,375
Trying to stay alive a little longer.
You sound a little...

143
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:27,849
...depressed or something, you all right?

144
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,314
You stopping?

145
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,086
This ain't the courthouse, man.
What you doing?

146
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,321
Yo.

147
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:41,891
Yo, why you stopping?

148
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:45,401
You gonna rush me out to court,
and now you stopping? What are you...?

149
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:47,732
Hey. Hey, man.

150
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:52,708
Hey, man. Listen, man, I got an important
appointment after my court date, man.

151
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:56,644
That shit ain't funny, man.
Come on, man. It's not a game, man.

152
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,374
Yo.

153
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,243
Some bullshit, man.

154
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:05,218
Hey. Hey!

155
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,951
No, man. It ain't Miller Time, man.

156
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:17,195
<i>The weather will be clear early morning,
but the rest of the day...</i>

157
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,269
Sam. Hey, Angela.

158
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,840
<i>So we are looking at a hot, humid day.</i>

159
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:25,272
<i>Looks like temperature
might reach 100 degrees...</i>

160
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,344
<i>...so don't forget
to pack your sunscreen.</i>

161
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:29,208
Add a pack of these, will you?

162
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:32,908
I know this dude smelled funny.
I got the wrong dude, man.

163
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,051
17.50. What?

164
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:39,521
Hey, don't open it. Come over here.

165
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,390
What time is it, man?

166
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:44,324
It's 8:11.

167
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,796
That's a good sign. That's a good sign.

168
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,766
I'm on my way. I'm gonna get there.

169
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:57,035
- Want change?
- No, you keep the change.

170
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,700
Keep the change.
All right, you have a good day.

171
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:02,177
- I don't want the peanuts.
- Bye.

172
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,775
No, man. Can't do nothing for you,
understand?

173
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,511
Hey, you better give me that change.
I'm gonna need that.

174
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:10,245
You see my situation right here?

175
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:11,787
No, no, no! No, no, no!

176
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:50,091
Hey!

177
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,006
How am I supposed to get out?

178
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:37,998
- Come on.
- Help me. Help me.

179
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:46,851
- My book. Why did you stop?
- Go, left, go. Left.

180
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,886
Move. Move. Move.

181
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,717
Wait. Freeze!

182
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,156
In here. Come on.

183
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,390
Shit.

184
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:03,523
Hey!

185
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,762
Just get out of here, now!
Go on. Go!

186
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,935
Come on, let's go.
That way, let's go. Go, go.

187
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:20,579
Ready? Here.

188
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,816
Let's go. Go.

189
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:32,256
- Dominic, get people out of here, right now.
- Jesus, Jackie. What's going on?

190
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,729
- Everybody. You too.
- All right, okay.

191
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:38,536
- Let's go.
- Come on, come on, come on.

192
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,201
Hey, yo.

193
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:48,341
Come on, keep going. Come on.
Come on, move it.

194
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:54,018
Yeah, this is Detective Jack Mosley,
shield number 227.

195
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:57,451
I am 10-13, at... Hold on a minute.

196
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:01,616
- Dominic, what's the address here?
- 133 Mulberry.

197
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,694
133 Mulberry.

198
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,456
Mulberry Street.

199
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,533
All right.

200
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:20,973
Is they coming?

201
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,581
I don't know why you stopped, man.

202
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:31,886
I don't know why
you would do that, man.

203
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:35,854
They said you were nobody.

204
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:38,758
- I ain't nobody.
- Shut up.

205
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,900
You a wino. You need to stop drinking,
that's what you need.

206
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:45,230
Shut up.

207
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,714
Jack?

208
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,583
- Frank.
- Hey.

209
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,615
You all right?

210
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,347
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

211
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:10,323
We were on Mott when the call went out.
Heard it was you.

212
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:12,594
Got here as soon as we could.

213
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,734
Oh, hi.

214
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:21,439
- Hey.
- You all right?

215
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,075
- Yeah, I'm all right.
- You having fun?

216
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:27,202
- No.
- No? Oh, well.

217
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,544
Gotta have fun.

218
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:37,253
- What's up, Jack?
- Hey, man. Hi.

219
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:42,555
You did a really great, great job, man.

220
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,923
You got yourself a bad guy.

221
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:48,458
Been a while, huh? Yeah.

222
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:53,799
We got the second shooter
half a block from here, so it's done.

223
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,441
- Sure you're okay?
- Yeah.

224
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:02,068
I'm just getting my wind. I was running.

225
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,616
Why don't you let us take it from here.

226
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:07,081
Oh, yeah.

227
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:11,814
We'll get the kid where he belongs,
and you don't have to worry about a thing.

228
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:14,215
- We'll get you home.
- Yes, please.

229
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,953
Please, please, officer.
That's a very good idea...

230
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:20,064
...because, honestly, I don't think
this dude is doing too good.

231
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:21,460
I told him not to stop.

232
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:24,124
I asked him not to stop.
He just had to stop.

233
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,999
That's when everything happened.
Dude came to the window.

234
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:29,663
I have a very important
appointment aft...

235
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,275
Jack.

236
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,642
Hey, Shue.

237
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,345
Come on. Here.

238
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,047
Why don't you take this. Come on.

239
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,819
We'll get you out of here.
Got a car waiting. All right?

240
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:50,427
Get some sleep.

241
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,423
Jack?

242
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:29,864
The kid was gonna testify against Jerry.

243
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:34,032
He saw Jerry doing some business.

244
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:39,071
Now, we both know that Jerry has never
been a standup guy like you and me.

245
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:45,072
He'll roll over, they indict him.
We can't have that.

246
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,845
No. It's gonna hurt a lot of us.

247
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:53,222
Come on.

248
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:07,732
See, this whole thing caught us...
It caught us completely unaware.

249
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:13,807
It was supposed to be
Teach's nephew driving him.

250
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:17,506
But he got stuck out there in traffic,
who knows where...

251
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,675
...so then your lieutenant, he pegged you.

252
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:26,915
You know, just the wrong time
and the wrong place for you today.

253
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:33,694
All right. Now, you know that I would never
put you in a position like this, right?

254
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,890
You know that, huh?

255
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:39,094
And I never figured
you'd cap one of those guys.

256
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,836
- That's what I get for hiring drug addicts.
- Grab the gun.

257
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:48,905
Grab the gun. There you go.

258
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:51,408
Come on. Frank?

259
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,647
- Here we go.
- All right, here we go. Jack.

260
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,120
Squeeze the trigger.

261
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,059
All right. Let go of the gun.
Let go of the gun.

262
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,600
I figure it like this.

263
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:16,635
You... You pop the guys
trying to spring the kid.

264
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:19,572
The kid, well, he gets your gun.

265
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,370
And he takes you hostage.

266
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:25,983
So we came in and saved the day.

267
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:28,449
He died, you lived.

268
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:32,915
Now, this could be a good thing
for you, Jack.

269
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,490
Get you back where you belong.

270
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,299
- Are you still with?
- Stand up.

271
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,873
- You still with what's-her-name?
- Come on, stand up.

272
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:54,334
- What are you waiting for?
- What's her name?

273
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:12,625
Caroline.

274
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,496
It's Caroline.

275
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,695
This changes everything, Jack.

276
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,531
Over here.

277
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:31,108
Come on, Frank.

278
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:39,657
Kid, get up. Come on.

279
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:47,595
Shit. Man, shit.

280
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:55,663
All right, Jack, it's 8:25.

281
00:22:56,475 --> 00:23:00,571
- You stay there.
- Listen to me, the jury's tenure ends at 10.

282
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:04,443
All right? The kid gets there
one minute past, all this...

283
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,482
...it doesn't matter.

284
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:13,422
And all you gotta do
is look the other way.

285
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:15,526
All right? We still got options here.

286
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:16,991
Okay?

287
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:18,390
We just want the kid.

288
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:24,063
Jack, Jack, Jack,
just let me help you.

289
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,763
All right?

290
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:27,564
Back up.

291
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:33,833
Jack, once you go out that door...

292
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,977
...I can't help you.

293
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:39,276
Please just back up, Frank.
Just back up.

294
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:00,962
He shot a cop.

295
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:03,833
What the hell did you see?
What did you see?

296
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,772
That cop back there.

297
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,571
I seen him around my way...

298
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:10,772
...holding a gun in this
little Puerto Rican kid's mouth.

299
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,746
Come on. Let's go.

300
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:16,012
He said he'd kill his mother
if he testified.

301
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,115
What you doing that for?
We need that.

302
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,590
The shell in that gun was over 20 years old.
Lucky it went off at all.

303
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:25,821
- They didn't tell you Shue was a cop?
- No, they didn't tell me.

304
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,090
They showed me a picture, that was it.

305
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:32,327
Well, congratulations, because you're about
to testify against one of New York's worst.

306
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:34,472
- What?
- Fellas, look, the clock's ticking.

307
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:37,767
He's gotta be at the courthouse by 10.
We know where he's going.

308
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:40,309
Mulvey, you're coming with me.

309
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,939
- Know where you're going?
- Take the north side.

310
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:44,741
- You got it, let's go.
- Come on.

311
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:48,817
- Captain.
- Where are we, Frank?

312
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,785
Well, we're putting descriptions out
over precinct channels.

313
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:56,792
No names, or that one's a cop.
It'll help to have some eyes.

314
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,858
- How long can you sit on this?
- He shot a cop.

315
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,324
You're the precinct captain, Dan.
How long?

316
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,562
I don't know.
Hour, maybe a little more.

317
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,799
- Who's on this with you?
- My guys.

318
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:13,172
Ortiz and Maldonado from the 66.
Touhey and Kaller from the 111.

319
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,370
A couple others
you don't wanna know about.

320
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:22,012
The guy was your partner for 20 years.

321
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,519
What the hell happened in there?

322
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,953
- Is he drunk?
- I don't know.

323
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:29,586
I don't know. We woke him up.

324
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:33,390
Hopefully he'll do what he always does,
and we can go back to work.

325
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:35,430
If he doesn't?

326
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:42,438
We gotta quash this thing
before he gets his legs back.

327
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,233
These are his streets.

328
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:52,211
This could get ugly for all of us
if that kid talks.

329
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,716
- He can't talk.
- He won't talk.

330
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,688
Look, I appreciate
what you did for me back there...

331
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:00,518
...but I'm starting to think
you're not the dude for this.

332
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:03,320
I mean, you're out of breath,
you're hung-over.

333
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:05,759
Your leg is gonna give out on you
any second, man.

334
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:09,230
I got someplace I need to be at 12,
you understand?

335
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,301
I need to be finished at court by 10...

336
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:13,869
...or I'm not gonna get
where I'm supposed to get.

337
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,906
- You understand what I'm saying?
- All right, I understand.

338
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:20,511
- You're not listening to what I'm saying.
- Wait, come here. Come here.

339
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:26,706
Come on.

340
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,151
Hung-over.

341
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:32,119
A bad leg.

342
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,087
No gun.

343
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,457
- Bobby?
- Yeah?

344
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:42,464
<i>- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- I'm already there.</i>

345
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:08,957
Oh, God.

346
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:14,628
Come on, let's go.

347
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:19,498
Listen, just stay put right here.
I'll be right back.

348
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:25,004
Come on, man, don't take long.
We gotta go.

349
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:29,104
Hurry up.

350
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:33,050
- Hey, man, where your bathroom?
- What?

351
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:35,083
Your bathroom. Where your bathroom at?

352
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:37,448
Down at the end of the hall.

353
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,289
Yeah.

354
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:44,419
That's what you look like
when you smile, huh?

355
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,528
You was probably drinking then too.

356
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:53,337
There's the lady.

357
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:57,131
Redhead. She cute. That ain't bad.

358
00:27:57,308 --> 00:28:00,573
Hey, man. Come on, don't be stopping
to get high or nothing like that.

359
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:02,610
Man, we gotta go.

360
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:07,717
Make sure you lift the seat up
before you go.

361
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:12,885
It's up already.

362
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:17,888
Maybe you left it like that, huh?

363
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:00,295
I'm coming.

364
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:17,683
Hey, Jack.

365
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:20,319
Jack Mosley.

366
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:25,491
Why did you do that?

367
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:28,555
Do what?

368
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:31,001
Shoot that cop.

369
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,295
Cops...

370
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:36,130
...they don't shoot other cops.

371
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:41,476
Especially over nobody like me.

372
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:56,184
It's a long way to go for a stranger,
you know.

373
00:29:57,862 --> 00:29:59,454
Thank you.

374
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:02,463
I never had nobody...

375
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,465
Hell, man, you know.

376
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:08,231
I don't rock with the police,
you know what I'm saying?

377
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,940
- Finger off the trigger.
- They never been my friend.

378
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:12,838
- Then here you come.
- On the ground.

379
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:14,911
It's kind of bugging me out, you know.

380
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,747
You on some vigilante business.

381
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:20,384
Let's go.

382
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,179
- Jack...
- Put your arms around the pole.

383
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:25,947
I don't know what to think anymore.

384
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:29,423
- Here. Cuff yourself.
- What are you doing, Jack?

385
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:32,586
Yeah, it's a little strange.

386
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:35,232
You know? By any definition, this here.

387
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,163
All right, kid. Good.

388
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,893
Okay.

389
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:42,766
Okay, okay, okay.

390
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:44,870
Okay.

391
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:47,408
Okay.

392
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:51,176
You should have done
what you always do, Jack.

393
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:55,884
- Where's your phone?
- It's on the left-hand side.

394
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,751
They know I'm here.
If I don't answer it...

395
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:05,362
- Jack?
- Let's go, kid. Come on.

396
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:22,877
<i>- Bob.
- Bob's a little tied up right now, Frank.</i>

397
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,172
<i>All right, I'm impressed, Jack.</i>

398
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,476
Did you shoot him too?

399
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,120
Send someone to check on Bobby.

400
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,021
<i>Jack, you're not up to this.</i>

401
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:40,092
<i>All right? It's gonna end bad for you.</i>

402
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:46,359
You lost the kid, didn't you?

403
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:50,207
<i>He bailed on you. Well, you know what?</i>

404
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,536
<i>That is the best thing
that could have happened.</i>

405
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,041
<i>So why don't you go home.</i>

406
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:55,440
Forget about what happened.

407
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:58,138
We'll take it from here.
Are you looking for him?

408
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:00,045
<i>And you can't find him.</i>

409
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:02,311
<i>We're gonna find him, all right?</i>

410
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:04,082
<i>We're gonna find him.</i>

411
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,985
All right, Jack, now you can hang up.

412
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,727
Where are you, kid?

413
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:15,724
All right. Now, let's see
which way he went.

414
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,494
Did he go up? Did he go down?

415
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,104
In or out, Jackie.
Which way did he go?

416
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,841
Let's see if he went down.

417
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:30,105
- Excuse me, sir, do you mind swiping?
- Get a job, man.

418
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,010
Ma'am, would you mind swiping me in?

419
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:35,175
Ma'am? Ma'am, would you mind
swiping me in, please, ma'am?

420
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:38,413
I have a very important
appointment I have to...

421
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:44,120
Excuse me, ma'am, would you mind...?
Somebody mind swiping me in?

422
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:47,526
I'm trying to get
to an important appointment.

423
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:50,361
Somebody help me. Somebody help me.

424
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:52,730
Somebody help me.

425
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:54,670
Hey.

426
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:58,039
Come here.

427
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:01,811
- Come on. Go.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

428
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:18,418
Eddie!

429
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:20,029
- Oh, no.
- What are you doing?

430
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:22,029
- Why are you running?
- What do you want?

431
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,464
It's too much, man.
I'm doing the rest on my own.

432
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:26,967
I'm doing what I said.
I'm getting out of here.

433
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:30,335
- Lf I can find you, they can find you!
- I'm doing what I said.

434
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,538
Eddie, listen to me. Listen to me.
Listen to me!

435
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:36,578
- I'm your only friend down here.
- No, you're not my friend.

436
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:39,979
- I can do this...
- Friend? You don't even know me!

437
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:42,517
And get me where?
You gonna get me shot.

438
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:46,416
Ever since I've been with you, people been
trying to shoot me. People you know!

439
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:49,856
Look, man, I got someplace I need to be.
I got something I need to do.

440
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,724
Unless you gonna shoot me or arrest me,
I'm going, Jack.

441
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:56,025
- I can't let you leave.
- Thank you, Jack Mosley. I'm going.

442
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,668
- You can't leave.
- Yes, I can. Thank you, Jack Mosley.

443
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,562
Stop. Don't do that. Stop.

444
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:03,138
Ladies and gentlemen...!
You're not going. Come here.

445
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:05,275
Eddie!

446
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,709
Okay, okay.
Okay, we gotta go.

447
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,371
- Move! Move!
- Get out of the way!

448
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:16,013
Move! Move!

449
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,988
- Here, come on.
- What are you doing?

450
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:29,793
Taxi! Hey!

451
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:31,832
Taxi!

452
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,438
It's Kaller. He just missed them
at the Canal Street station.

453
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:40,710
Where, where, where?

454
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:44,038
Shit. Where the hell is he?

455
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:46,414
Goddamn it.

456
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,779
We're gonna find you.

457
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:51,547
Yeah, this is Detective Nugent.
I need a triangulation...

458
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:55,749
<i>...on Detective Torres' cell phone.
Area code 935...</i>

459
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:04,062
That cop back at the apartment,
he said you should do what you always do.

460
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:06,897
What did he...?
What did he mean by that?

461
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:11,872
You're not doing
what you always do, huh?

462
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:14,841
Jack Mosley, I get it. I see the signs.

463
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:18,345
I'm where I'm supposed to be.
I was wrong. You're the right guy.

464
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:21,713
I could have got another guy,
did something different, but I got you.

465
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:23,649
I appreciate it. You're the right guy.

466
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:24,810
- Okay?
- Okay.

467
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:27,480
<i>- This is Comtech, over.
- Yeah, go, this is Nugent.</i>

468
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:30,752
GPS indicates they're on Bowery.

469
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:32,953
<i>Repeat, Bowery,
moving south towards Pell.</i>

470
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,621
<i>Speed indicates they're on foot.</i>

471
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,892
Are you hearing this, boys?
He's in Chinatown.

472
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:39,065
<i>Let's move in.</i>

473
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:50,476
- What's the deal with that book?
- It's my business plans.

474
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,412
I'm moving to Seattle.
My sister's already living out there.

475
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:56,712
I'm gonna open up a bakery.
But it's only, like, a specialty bakery.

476
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:59,789
Birthday cakes for little kids.
There's a lot of money in that.

477
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:02,790
I'm gonna send you
a big birthday cake on your birthday...

478
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,428
- I hate birthday cakes.
- You hate birthday cakes?

479
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:07,393
First thing that doesn't go your way...

480
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:10,329
...you're gonna be slipping into
Carol's Clip and Curl...

481
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,492
...and stealing all her hair-care products.

482
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,195
Because you're a thief.
And that's what you are, Eddie.

483
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:18,809
- You're always gonna be a thief.
- People can change, Jack.

484
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:21,968
- Days change, seasons change. Not people.
- Yes, you do...

485
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:25,343
- People don't change, Eddie.
- Yes, you do. I'll get you that cake.

486
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,177
You know what it's gonna say on top?

487
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:31,253
"Jack Mosley, ha-ha-ha, eat this. " Make you
eat your words, lick your fingers too.

488
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:33,083
Subject's moving west on Pell.

489
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:39,854
Subject now moving south on Doyers.
Still moving south on Doyers.

490
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:43,592
Bobby, you take Doyer, we got Pell.
And, Kaller, you close up Bowery.

491
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:45,167
<i>- Copy that.
- Let's squeeze him.</i>

492
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:48,271
<i>- Copy that, on my way.
- Why don't you pull up. Pull up.</i>

493
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:33,207
- Sorry.
- Who is that? You can't go in here.

494
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:34,783
Oh, sorry.

495
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:58,433
Look, man, I gotta be down there.
All right, you understand?

496
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:02,711
I gotta be down there that way, and
there's streets and shit in between there.

497
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,475
You got some sort of plan?
Some sort of police plan or something?

498
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:09,449
I see your limp acting up.
You ought to get that checked out.

499
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:13,249
I have a buddy of mine
walking around with a limp just like that.

500
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:15,688
He don't wanna go
to the doctor, though, right?

501
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:19,455
Finally he go,
they say it's a fracture, right?

502
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,463
And now it's infected.
They gotta cut it off at the knee.

503
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,426
Wasn't so bad, though.
He had no more pain.

504
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:28,436
He ended up moving to Jersey,
working for the PATH...

505
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:31,006
...being a motorman.
Got a pension and shit now.

506
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:34,736
I guess everything happens for a reason,
you know what I mean?

507
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:37,312
You're a sunny little shit,
I'll give you that much.

508
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,455
Get in here! Get in that door!

509
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,951
Jack!

510
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:53,328
- Pull me in! Help me in!
- Come on, come on, come on.

511
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,589
Lock the door.

512
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:02,037
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Hold up.

513
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:05,369
Come on.

514
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,067
- You all right?
- Yeah.

515
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:57,454
Jack, what are we doing?
Where are we going?

516
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:05,001
- Come on.
- Where we going, Jack?

517
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,894
Out of the way.

518
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,505
Over here.

519
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:14,507
Jack? How we even know that Centre Street
Courthouse is in this direction, Jack?

520
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:16,305
Jack? We gotta know...

521
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:19,182
Down! Head down!

522
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:21,507
Go!

523
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:26,513
Come on!

524
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,469
Kaller!

525
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:44,907
Push it.

526
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:17,831
You all right, Jack?

527
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:25,206
I was aiming for the kid,
if that makes you feel better.

528
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:27,316
Well, you missed!

529
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,416
That kid is gonna get you killed.

530
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:37,658
He worth that?

531
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:46,059
Well, I got all day.

532
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,564
How about you, you got all day?

533
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:56,076
- Jack, you still there?
- Yeah.

534
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,779
Still here.

535
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,251
Well, this is awkward.

536
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,716
When I started this day...

537
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:13,192
...I never figured on trading
9 mils with my friend.

538
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:20,165
I think we stopped being friends
right around 8:25, in that bar.

539
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:22,495
No.

540
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:28,277
No, that's not gonna erase
20 years together.

541
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:29,877
We're still friends.

542
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:36,383
Look...

543
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:39,719
...a lot I'd take back, but I can't.

544
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:44,693
Well, so you move forward.
Next day, next case.

545
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:47,956
- Lines were crossed.
- What lines?

546
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:53,365
- You hear me? Lines were crossed, Frank.
- What lines? There are no lines!

547
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:56,264
There's getting it done
and not getting it done, period!

548
00:42:56,974 --> 00:43:00,535
You put the bad guys away
no matter what it takes.

549
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:03,236
Now, you're gonna ruin the lives...

550
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:05,908
...of six cops.

551
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:08,679
Good cops.

552
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:10,649
Good men.

553
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:18,751
Are you ready to sacrifice
their lives for that kid?

554
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:21,731
Hey, Frank.

555
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:23,897
- Frank.
- Yeah?

556
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:27,401
This is not about me
ruining anybody's life.

557
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:29,835
Okay? This is about you.

558
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:32,670
You hear me?

559
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:35,269
Yeah.

560
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,275
You look at that kid's jacket?

561
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:41,444
I did.

562
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:45,019
- Armed robbery, assault, beats old women...
- I never had no armed robbery!

563
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:48,317
Beats old women over the heads,
steals their Social Security checks.

564
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:51,484
- One time, I used...
- Shut up. Shut up.

565
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:53,527
Oh, no, don't tell him to shut up.

566
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:58,896
No, Jack, listen to him.
No, that kid, he's sharp.

567
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:00,331
Yeah, he's playing you.

568
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:04,601
He's sharper than you are.

569
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:07,435
He's telling you stories, right?

570
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:10,444
He wants to be a good citizen.

571
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:13,010
Go to church.

572
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:15,642
Buy his mother a house.

573
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:19,687
But he has spent
more than half his life in prison.

574
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:26,958
Two hours ago, he was sitting in a cell
for weapons possession.

575
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:29,929
- He's always gonna do what he has done.
- I wasn't...

576
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:33,536
He is a career criminal.
That's who you're protecting.

577
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:38,875
- You all right?
- Yeah. Frank's got him on the other side.

578
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:40,873
He's got my gun too.

579
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:43,337
Now, if you can't see
how wrong this is...

580
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,506
...I promise you
I will speak from my heart...

581
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:50,019
...when I give the eulogy at your funeral.

582
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,883
So...

583
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:55,819
...do you believe the kid?

584
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:01,029
Or do you believe your ex-partner?

585
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:08,496
Frank, we're right
on the other side of the door.

586
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:10,435
Because...

587
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:13,936
...if you believe the kid...

588
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,777
...you got a choice to make.

589
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:29,124
Do you go through your ex-partner?

590
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,858
Or do you choose door number two...

591
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:38,599
...and go back to where you came,
with your gimpy leg and your shot-up hand?

592
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:51,244
You're not gonna get very far.
And what if your ex-partner is right, Jack?

593
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:55,142
What if he is right, and you're wasting
your whole miserable life?

594
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:16,567
- It's Frank.
- You all right?

595
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:19,402
Yeah. They're in the elevator.
Seal the building.

596
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:21,975
Come on, Bobby.
Come on, get on that.

597
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,145
Everybody out! Police!

598
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:29,514
Everybody out! Police!
Move, move! Police!

599
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:33,656
- Frank, where are you?
- Bobby, I'm coming up!

600
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:37,953
All right. Come on, come on.
Upstairs. Seal the stairwell.

601
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:40,460
- All right.
- Find the back stairs. Check the roof.

602
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,189
- Come on, Mal! This way.
- Got you.

603
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:44,732
- Maldonado, seal it up.
- Got you.

604
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:03,817
Hello? Hello? Hello?

605
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:11,349
- No, nothing.
- No answer. He's not there. Come on.

606
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:21,870
I never open door.

607
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:25,270
Please. Please, help.

608
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:28,975
Come on.

609
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,250
Jack, Jack, Jack. Thank you.

610
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,822
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

611
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:44,450
- You saw that, right? You heard him, right?
- Yeah. He never opens the door.

612
00:47:53,837 --> 00:47:56,806
Thank you very much, sir. Thank you.

613
00:47:57,474 --> 00:47:59,704
- Thank you. Thank you very much, sir.
- Thank you.

614
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:03,040
- You heard him, right, Jack?
- Not now, Eddie.

615
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:06,376
- Keep your voice down.
- He said he never opens the door.

616
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,041
You know what that mean, right?

617
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:13,579
Not right now.
There's the signs everywhere.

618
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:17,693
<i>- Yeah, ADA MacDonald, please.
- May I tell her who's calling?</i>

619
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:20,295
Yeah, tell her it's the guy
that's got her witness.

620
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:30,832
You're driving a car
during a hurricane.

621
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:32,532
Like:

622
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:34,734
A hurricane.

623
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,972
And there's three people at a bus stop.

624
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:40,616
- A old woman.
- Yeah.

625
00:48:40,784 --> 00:48:43,776
A friend, like my friend here.

626
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:47,156
Him. He save your life, your friend.

627
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:50,424
It's Detective Mosley for you.

628
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:51,754
- Mosley?
- Yeah?

629
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,726
Where are you?
Where's my witness?

630
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:55,660
I'm about seven blocks from you.

631
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:58,164
But there's about a ton of cops
between me and you.

632
00:48:58,335 --> 00:49:00,064
And they all want this kid dead.

633
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:02,728
Not to mention that
you got a leak in your office.

634
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:06,000
- Somebody's talking to these cops.
- Shit.

635
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:08,838
What did you think was gonna happen
when you pinched Shue?

636
00:49:09,012 --> 00:49:11,480
You thought they'd just lay down
and go away quietly?

637
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:14,242
We thought if we went to the grand jury,
Shue would fold.

638
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:15,646
He bent but didn't break.

639
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:19,311
<i>We were gonna throw it away until
we ran into Edward Bunker last night.</i>

640
00:49:19,756 --> 00:49:23,954
Jury's tenure ends at 10. Without that kid,
they'll vote no bill and it all goes away.

641
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,357
<i>He's an eyewitness.
He makes this work.</i>

642
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:29,260
Where are you? I'll send my squad.
Richard, pen.

643
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:48,781
What room?

644
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:58,389
- So, what, are they coming?
- Yeah, they're coming.

645
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:03,995
Good. Because I gotta be somewhere, man.
I got something to do.

646
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:07,398
I gotta be someplace by noon.
I gotta go get something.

647
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:09,505
It's real important.

648
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:11,232
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

649
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:14,508
Ortiz, I'm coming in the building.

650
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:17,738
Frank?

651
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:24,981
- Touhey and Kaller are taken care of.
- Good. Find Bobby. He's on the back stairs.

652
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:27,885
Eddie, come here, put this on.
Here, come on, put that on.

653
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:31,516
But it's a big, hot, wool shirt.
It's hot. It's summer.

654
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,323
- You're dressed like a criminal.
- Oh, you want me to...?

655
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:37,558
You want me to change my...?
I get it. But why can't I put that on?

656
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:39,326
- What about this?
- What about that?

657
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:42,768
- What's wrong with this? It's just a pattern.
- He don't even wear that.

658
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:44,270
Just put the... Here.

659
00:50:44,608 --> 00:50:46,200
Never mind. What about this?

660
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:50,540
Is this all right? Mass-transit blue?

661
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,520
When I was locked up,
they had me work in the kitchen.

662
00:50:57,687 --> 00:51:00,121
So one day a little dude
walk up to me and say:

663
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:02,258
"Hey, you think
you could bake me a cake?"

664
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:04,189
I said, "Yeah, I'll bake you a cake. "

665
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:07,421
I ain't tell him I ain't never
baked a cake, you know.

666
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:09,121
But I ain't got shit else to do.

667
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:13,235
So, you know, I read the instructions...

668
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:16,167
...I bake him a cake, you know,
for his daughter's birthday.

669
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:18,068
She'd come up there to visit him.

670
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:22,234
You know, it say,
"Happy Birthday, Angel," right?

671
00:51:22,846 --> 00:51:25,576
He go crazy.
He can't get enough, you know.

672
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:29,276
He said, "Eddie, you done hooked me up.
Man, you the man. "

673
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:31,944
And I started doing that.
It was good. I had a skill.

674
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:34,283
People look at me different.
They would start...

675
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:36,551
- You missed a button.
- Did I?

676
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:38,819
Your buttons are all crooked.

677
00:51:38,995 --> 00:51:41,361
- Come on. Come on, man.
- All right.

678
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:43,860
Nugent.

679
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:48,467
You're a prince.

680
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:54,305
<i>- The word is 5E, boys, 5E.
- Got it.</i>

681
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:59,839
Then I start doing my research,
doing my due diligence.

682
00:52:00,016 --> 00:52:04,112
I found out, you know, it's good money
in birthday cakes for kids, you know.

683
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:09,721
That type of thing, like Tweety Bird
or Bugs Bunny or something like that.

684
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:11,952
<i>Or Yu-Gi-Oh!.
You ever heard of Yu-Gi-Oh!?</i>

685
00:52:13,063 --> 00:52:17,022
<i>- Yu-Gi-Oh!.
- Yu-Gi-Oh!. Kids love that, man.</i>

686
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:24,936
<i>You don't know Yu-Gi-Oh!?
You gotta get out more. Yu-Gi-Oh! hot.</i>

687
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:26,336
Know what I'm saying?

688
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:35,015
I'm gonna make money, Jack.
Open up my bakery.

689
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:39,178
You gonna eat your words about me, Jack.
How do I look? Do I look all right?

690
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:42,655
- All right.
- Freeze! Police!

691
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:45,158
- Police! Police!
- Shut up!

692
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:46,852
- Oh, my God!
- Shut up!

693
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:50,324
Frank, they gave us
the wrong apartment.

694
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,028
Put it down.

695
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,374
Put it down.

696
00:53:04,428 --> 00:53:05,861
Can't get lucky all the time.

697
00:53:06,296 --> 00:53:08,127
You can be smart every day, though.

698
00:53:11,034 --> 00:53:14,026
- All right, give me the gun.
- Hold on.

699
00:53:14,204 --> 00:53:16,069
What are you doing?

700
00:53:21,712 --> 00:53:23,577
This place is crawling with cops, Eddie.

701
00:53:24,281 --> 00:53:26,511
Hey, look at me.

702
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:31,378
Eddie, what are you doing?

703
00:53:31,688 --> 00:53:34,156
How does it feel?

704
00:53:37,527 --> 00:53:38,994
How does it feel?

705
00:53:39,496 --> 00:53:41,487
You're a baker, right?

706
00:53:42,499 --> 00:53:45,662
Eddie, listen to him.

707
00:53:45,969 --> 00:53:47,960
Pull that trigger,
you go to jail for life.

708
00:53:48,939 --> 00:53:50,338
<i>Frank, we're on our way down.</i>

709
00:53:51,708 --> 00:53:54,074
<i>Frank, do you read me?</i>

710
00:53:57,781 --> 00:53:59,942
- You can't stop me, you understand?
- Time to go.

711
00:54:00,117 --> 00:54:03,052
- Time to go.
- You can't stop me.

712
00:54:05,255 --> 00:54:07,450
You gave him a loaded weapon?

713
00:54:11,561 --> 00:54:13,358
- Frank.
- Bobby, get these things off me.

714
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:16,124
- Did he take your gun?
- They went south. Get out of here.

715
00:54:16,299 --> 00:54:20,599
Ortiz! Ortiz, give me a piece.
Give me a piece! Get over here.

716
00:54:25,075 --> 00:54:27,407
Make a hole, make a hole.
Come on, make a hole.

717
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:43,186
Speak to me.
Come on, somebody, speak to me.

718
00:54:46,496 --> 00:54:47,963
Turn.

719
00:54:56,173 --> 00:54:57,970
- Excuse me!
- Open up!

720
00:54:58,975 --> 00:55:01,341
- Excuse me!
- Open up!

721
00:55:02,179 --> 00:55:04,204
Keep moving. Go.
Go, go, go.

722
00:55:06,583 --> 00:55:07,811
Oh, shit.

723
00:55:10,821 --> 00:55:13,119
On the bus! Let's go.

724
00:55:18,562 --> 00:55:20,359
- Just keep driving.
- What are you doing?

725
00:55:20,530 --> 00:55:23,988
- I'm a cop. Lock the back door.
- He's got a gun!

726
00:55:25,502 --> 00:55:28,198
No stops.
Tell them to hang on to something, Eddie!

727
00:55:28,371 --> 00:55:32,467
Hang on! Don't worry, this man,
he's a police officer.

728
00:55:32,642 --> 00:55:34,667
- Everything is gonna be fine.
- Hang on!

729
00:55:34,845 --> 00:55:36,676
Everybody just hang on. Don't worry!

730
00:55:45,689 --> 00:55:47,281
Right, right, right! Go right!

731
00:55:52,295 --> 00:55:54,525
- What are you doing?
- Stop this thing!

732
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:08,337
Get down!

733
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:38,040
Get away from the bus!
Away from the bus!

734
00:56:40,777 --> 00:56:42,540
Stay down! Stay down!

735
00:56:48,752 --> 00:56:50,185
Heads down!

736
00:56:53,056 --> 00:56:55,650
- Where the hell are you?
- Construction site at Baxter.

737
00:56:55,825 --> 00:56:57,053
He has hostages.

738
00:57:01,531 --> 00:57:02,793
Let me go.

739
00:57:10,874 --> 00:57:12,136
Listen!

740
00:57:12,442 --> 00:57:15,536
Everybody, stand up.
They're not gonna shoot you.

741
00:57:15,712 --> 00:57:18,112
Stand up in front of the windows.

742
00:57:18,281 --> 00:57:20,715
They won't shoot you.
You, stay down. Stay down.

743
00:57:25,889 --> 00:57:28,483
Fill in the blanks. Fill in the spots.

744
00:57:28,658 --> 00:57:30,785
Scoot over, scoot over! That's it.

745
00:57:30,961 --> 00:57:33,896
- All right, get Gruber down here.
- Okay.

746
00:57:39,569 --> 00:57:41,059
Hey!

747
00:57:42,038 --> 00:57:43,596
All right, seal off that end.

748
00:57:56,453 --> 00:57:59,752
- It's a busload.
- Jesus, this shit just gets deeper.

749
00:57:59,923 --> 00:58:01,584
- Bobby?
- Gruber's on his way.

750
00:58:02,125 --> 00:58:05,117
All right. We gotta get
our stories straight, all right?

751
00:58:05,295 --> 00:58:06,922
We're getting our stories straight?

752
00:58:12,836 --> 00:58:14,599
Yeah, suit up.

753
00:58:25,915 --> 00:58:28,816
Thought we could handle this quickly
and quietly, commissioner.

754
00:58:28,985 --> 00:58:31,613
A guy shoots a cop,
takes a grand-jury witness hostage...

755
00:58:31,788 --> 00:58:33,449
...and we're supposed to make nice?

756
00:58:33,623 --> 00:58:37,787
Commissioner, look, sir, this is...
Watch your back, sir.

757
00:58:37,961 --> 00:58:39,826
This is my fault, all right?

758
00:58:39,996 --> 00:58:43,329
I used to work with Mosley,
so I asked the captain to let me handle it.

759
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:46,992
I felt that I could bring him in.
I just didn't realize how far gone he was.

760
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:50,731
- Stay on Tac 2, boys.
- Wait for command, here we go.

761
00:58:52,442 --> 00:58:53,909
That's it, cover them up.

762
00:58:56,346 --> 00:59:00,009
Good, okay. Great job. Thank you.

763
00:59:07,357 --> 00:59:10,121
- Commissioner, sir. Captain.
- Hi, Mike.

764
00:59:10,293 --> 00:59:13,262
- What do we got?
- Cop. Twenty plus, flipped.

765
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:15,955
- Suicidal?
- Been to the farm twice the last four years.

766
00:59:16,132 --> 00:59:18,100
- Twice?
- Twice. Nothing like this, though.

767
00:59:18,268 --> 00:59:21,294
- What do you know, detective?
- Like the captain said, he flipped.

768
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:24,872
After he nailed Shue, he started
spouting crap about making headlines.

769
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:27,271
There's no way
that you're getting this guy out.

770
00:59:27,977 --> 00:59:31,845
<i>Please fall back behind the barricades.
On the sidewalk.</i>

771
00:59:32,549 --> 00:59:34,039
Smart cop.

772
00:59:34,484 --> 00:59:38,352
Okay. You're all gonna be okay.
We're gonna get you out of here.

773
00:59:38,521 --> 00:59:41,388
- Please, just move to the back of the bus.
- Jack?

774
00:59:41,558 --> 00:59:43,958
Just move to the back of the bus,
please, right now.

775
00:59:44,127 --> 00:59:47,028
It's okay. You're gonna get off the bus.
I am a police officer.

776
00:59:47,197 --> 00:59:50,894
Jack, it's Mike Sheehan from HNT.

777
00:59:51,067 --> 00:59:54,969
We worked that barricade deal
on the concourse a few years ago.

778
00:59:56,406 --> 00:59:59,398
I'm gonna put this thing down, okay?

779
01:00:04,013 --> 01:00:05,878
- I'm sorry.
- Jack!

780
01:00:06,049 --> 01:00:08,643
I'm sorry that I got you
in this situation.

781
01:00:08,818 --> 01:00:10,752
You know the drill, no weapons.

782
01:00:12,288 --> 01:00:13,619
Listen, you're on the job.

783
01:00:14,057 --> 01:00:16,252
- Just keep your head down.
- You know the deal.

784
01:00:16,426 --> 01:00:18,951
I'm just gonna step in here,
nice and easy...

785
01:00:19,562 --> 01:00:23,225
...and hand you this phone
so we can talk, okay?

786
01:00:23,399 --> 01:00:28,803
Make sure we got no injuries in there.
Jack, just open the door, okay?

787
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,164
- I need to...
- Just throw it, Mike!

788
01:00:32,342 --> 01:00:33,673
- Okay, you got it.
- Throw it!

789
01:00:33,843 --> 01:00:38,075
Here you go. Jack...

790
01:00:44,053 --> 01:00:45,645
<i>Jack, can you hear me?</i>

791
01:00:46,356 --> 01:00:48,290
How many people you got in there, Jack?

792
01:00:49,392 --> 01:00:51,724
Count how many people are here.

793
01:00:52,662 --> 01:00:55,654
Everybody put your hands up, please.

794
01:00:56,266 --> 01:01:00,259
<i>N. Y.P.D., we got a situation here.
We need you people back on the sidewalk.</i>

795
01:01:00,436 --> 01:01:04,338
<i>- Stay behind the barricade.
- Twenty-six, 28. okay, thank you.</i>

796
01:01:04,507 --> 01:01:07,135
That's everybody?
Please, don't cry, don't cry.

797
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:12,577
Everything's gonna be all right, just relax.
Stay calm, okay? Thank you.

798
01:01:12,749 --> 01:01:14,808
- What is it?
- Thirty-one. Thirty-one.

799
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:22,155
Okay, we have about
40 people on the bus.

800
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,686
Okay, that's good.

801
01:01:25,061 --> 01:01:27,996
You know, it's important
that we're clear with each other, Jack.

802
01:01:28,431 --> 01:01:31,525
<i>ESU and HNT are in place.</i>

803
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:37,206
The block is sealed, Jack.
It's a frozen zone.

804
01:01:37,507 --> 01:01:42,240
<i>So let's work this out
so everybody can go home, all right?</i>

805
01:01:42,412 --> 01:01:46,075
<i>That's all we wanna do.
Just end it, nice and easy.</i>

806
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:48,717
Jack?

807
01:01:48,885 --> 01:01:51,752
<i>Jack? This is as far as you go, buddy.</i>

808
01:01:52,088 --> 01:01:53,077
<i>Keep talk...</i>

809
01:02:11,941 --> 01:02:14,842
- Is everybody okay?
- Yeah.

810
01:02:15,545 --> 01:02:17,638
- Hi, how are you?
- Good.

811
01:02:17,814 --> 01:02:19,679
How are you?

812
01:02:19,849 --> 01:02:25,048
My name's Eddie. Hi, how you doing?
Everybody's okay?

813
01:02:29,125 --> 01:02:30,592
What's your name?

814
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,428
- Christina.
- Christina.

815
01:02:33,696 --> 01:02:38,463
That's a pretty name.
How old are you, Christina?

816
01:02:40,203 --> 01:02:42,569
- Seven.
- Seven years old.

817
01:02:45,275 --> 01:02:48,244
And my strawberry recipe...
I know I got one. Let me see.

818
01:02:49,112 --> 01:02:51,979
Where's my strawberry recipe? Let's see.

819
01:02:52,749 --> 01:02:56,276
Angel-food-cake recipe right here.

820
01:02:57,353 --> 01:03:00,754
Here we go, strawberry fan.

821
01:03:01,491 --> 01:03:03,584
See right here on the top?

822
01:03:03,893 --> 01:03:05,724
I can put a fan on the top.

823
01:03:06,396 --> 01:03:10,264
You know, like a Chinese fan?

824
01:03:10,633 --> 01:03:12,760
I could do that.

825
01:03:13,803 --> 01:03:15,566
When's your birthday?

826
01:03:16,005 --> 01:03:19,805
- September 22nd.
- Oh, so that's soon.

827
01:03:19,976 --> 01:03:24,743
Gonna be 8 years old, huh?
That's gonna be a good day for you.

828
01:03:25,081 --> 01:03:26,605
When's your birthday?

829
01:03:28,151 --> 01:03:30,415
Today, actually.

830
01:03:30,787 --> 01:03:34,188
- Yeah.
- Happy birthday to you.

831
01:03:38,528 --> 01:03:41,986
And, yeah, every day
is somebody's birthday, you know.

832
01:03:42,165 --> 01:03:45,328
That's gonna be the motto for my shop:

833
01:03:45,501 --> 01:03:47,560
"Every day's a birthday," you know.

834
01:03:47,737 --> 01:03:51,673
I didn't know my birthday
was gonna turn out like this, but...

835
01:03:51,841 --> 01:03:56,642
Yeah, I'm glad to be, you know,
here, alive, you know.

836
01:03:59,048 --> 01:04:00,948
<i>- Right here, Jack.
- Yeah, Sheehan.</i>

837
01:04:01,417 --> 01:04:02,782
Commissioner, sir.

838
01:04:02,952 --> 01:04:04,749
<i>- Sheehan?
- Right here.</i>

839
01:04:04,921 --> 01:04:07,446
<i>All right. This is what I want.</i>

840
01:04:07,623 --> 01:04:10,854
I want you to get me
Assistant District Attorney MacDonald...

841
01:04:11,027 --> 01:04:14,827
...a court stenographer
and somebody from Tv.

842
01:04:14,998 --> 01:04:16,795
<i>Somebody that I would recognize.</i>

843
01:04:16,966 --> 01:04:19,628
<i>I want them to come on the bus
and record sworn testimony.</i>

844
01:04:19,802 --> 01:04:24,034
When I get what I want,
I'll let everybody out. Safely.

845
01:04:24,207 --> 01:04:29,042
- That's a tall order. It'll take some time...
- Just do it. I'm not in the mood, okay?

846
01:04:29,212 --> 01:04:31,510
<i>Get these people here in 15 minutes...</i>

847
01:04:31,681 --> 01:04:34,206
<i>...or I'm gonna shoot
these passengers one at a time...</i>

848
01:04:34,384 --> 01:04:36,852
<i>- ... and throw them out the door.
- Jack, be cool, okay?</i>

849
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:39,989
Let's not do anything rash.
This thing can end without bloodshed.

850
01:04:40,156 --> 01:04:42,124
<i>- Okay? We can work this...
- Fifteen minutes.</i>

851
01:04:42,291 --> 01:04:44,987
Jack? Jack?

852
01:04:48,164 --> 01:04:49,961
He's gone.

853
01:04:51,834 --> 01:04:53,426
All right, everybody on your feet.

854
01:04:54,904 --> 01:04:57,873
- Jack, what are you doing?
- Gotta get these people off this bus.

855
01:04:58,041 --> 01:05:01,306
But you just made your call.
You called the DA. They said they'd come.

856
01:05:01,477 --> 01:05:03,775
- Everybody's coming.
- Nobody's coming, okay?

857
01:05:03,946 --> 01:05:05,504
What do you mean,
nobody's coming?

858
01:05:05,681 --> 01:05:08,912
They're gonna breach this bus
in less than five minutes.

859
01:05:09,085 --> 01:05:12,213
- They're gonna kill me, kill you...
- Jack, what about testifying?

860
01:05:12,388 --> 01:05:14,686
We're right here. We can go.
We can end this.

861
01:05:14,857 --> 01:05:17,291
- We can testify.
- Nobody's testifying.

862
01:05:18,294 --> 01:05:20,387
It's all over, Eddie.

863
01:05:20,563 --> 01:05:22,758
We lose, kid.

864
01:05:34,811 --> 01:05:37,541
- Hey, Ray.
- Frank.

865
01:05:37,713 --> 01:05:39,305
You?

866
01:05:40,983 --> 01:05:42,280
You guys going in?

867
01:05:42,452 --> 01:05:44,886
The commissioner hasn't given us
the green light yet.

868
01:05:45,054 --> 01:05:51,050
Well, I don't need to remind you
that he shot two of us.

869
01:05:53,096 --> 01:05:55,030
Enough said.

870
01:05:55,498 --> 01:05:58,399
We got maybe 40 civilians on that bus.
Get them out.

871
01:05:58,568 --> 01:06:00,661
I don't want anybody hurt,
including our guys.

872
01:06:00,837 --> 01:06:03,931
Nobody's gonna get hurt, commissioner.
These guys know what to do.

873
01:06:11,147 --> 01:06:13,672
<i>- We have movement.
- Let's move in.</i>

874
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:16,683
<i>- Hold your fire. Repeat, hold your fire.
- Move in to the bus. Let's go.</i>

875
01:06:19,689 --> 01:06:21,452
Hey. What...?

876
01:06:23,426 --> 01:06:24,415
Bob.

877
01:06:27,296 --> 01:06:28,490
When you get outside...

878
01:06:28,664 --> 01:06:30,529
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

879
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:33,362
They'll take you to a holding area.
It'll be hectic.

880
01:06:33,536 --> 01:06:36,437
- But everybody's out there...
- Listen to me, listen to me.

881
01:06:36,606 --> 01:06:39,166
Once you get outside that perimeter,
you just get lost.

882
01:06:39,342 --> 01:06:42,334
- What if they...?
- Keep moving. You just keep moving.

883
01:06:42,512 --> 01:06:43,843
Come here. You look great.

884
01:06:44,013 --> 01:06:45,776
Hey, gray suit.

885
01:06:46,916 --> 01:06:48,440
Got you a gray suit.

886
01:06:48,618 --> 01:06:51,815
All right? Hands in the air, folks.
Don't look back.

887
01:06:59,896 --> 01:07:02,831
Hands in the air, you'll be all right.
You'll be all right.

888
01:07:15,044 --> 01:07:16,568
Next. Sorry.

889
01:07:26,355 --> 01:07:28,220
Come on, come on, let's go!

890
01:07:28,391 --> 01:07:30,222
- What is he doing?
- How should I know?

891
01:07:30,393 --> 01:07:32,486
- I'll let you know when I know.
- Don't you...

892
01:07:32,662 --> 01:07:35,028
I'll let you know when I know.
Out of my face!

893
01:07:45,208 --> 01:07:47,506
Kaller, give me a hand with them!

894
01:07:51,647 --> 01:07:54,013
Bobby? Right there. Right here.

895
01:07:54,550 --> 01:07:57,246
- That's him. That's him.
- Hey, man!

896
01:07:58,354 --> 01:08:00,481
- It's not him.
- Let him go.

897
01:08:00,656 --> 01:08:02,715
- The dude, he changed. It's not me.
- What?

898
01:08:02,892 --> 01:08:05,554
- He's in a suit, a gray suit.
- Suit, gray suit.

899
01:08:26,482 --> 01:08:29,144
- We count 31.
- That leaves eight people on the bus.

900
01:08:29,318 --> 01:08:30,979
No, I was the last one off the bus.

901
01:08:31,153 --> 01:08:34,054
The only person left on that bus
is the guy with the gun.

902
01:08:35,124 --> 01:08:36,955
- Then go, do it!
- Let's go, let's go.

903
01:08:37,126 --> 01:08:40,357
- Get your people out there. Let's go.
- Come on, let's go.

904
01:08:41,163 --> 01:08:44,291
Mosley is still on the bus.
That kid is here somewhere. We checked...

905
01:08:44,467 --> 01:08:46,264
Bobby, I don't care what you checked.

906
01:08:46,435 --> 01:08:48,995
Check it again, now. Go.
You guys, that way.

907
01:09:02,818 --> 01:09:07,778
This is Detective Jack Mosley.
Shield number 227.

908
01:09:18,801 --> 01:09:21,361
I guess this will be
my last will and testament.

909
01:10:15,191 --> 01:10:16,419
Don't shoot!

910
01:10:16,792 --> 01:10:18,191
Hold your fire!

911
01:10:18,361 --> 01:10:20,158
Do not shoot! Do not shoot!

912
01:10:20,329 --> 01:10:22,524
<i>- Who is that?
- Hold your fire!</i>

913
01:10:23,332 --> 01:10:25,391
<i>- Hold your fire!
- Is it that wit from the 32?</i>

914
01:10:27,002 --> 01:10:29,266
Get on your goddamn radio.
Find out who that is.

915
01:10:29,438 --> 01:10:31,201
Guns down, hold your fire!

916
01:10:32,742 --> 01:10:33,970
Don't shoot!

917
01:10:34,143 --> 01:10:36,077
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

918
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:39,442
Don't shoot!

919
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:41,378
Don't shoot!

920
01:10:44,854 --> 01:10:48,255
- Do not move! Step away from the bus!
- Don't shoot, hold your fire!

921
01:10:48,424 --> 01:10:50,415
- Do not shoot!
- Get away from the bus!

922
01:10:50,593 --> 01:10:51,719
Hold your fire.

923
01:10:52,728 --> 01:10:56,596
Jack. Jack, it's me. Jack Mosley!

924
01:10:57,233 --> 01:10:59,133
It's me, Eddie, Jack.

925
01:11:01,971 --> 01:11:03,370
Chuck Berry.

926
01:11:03,706 --> 01:11:05,196
Chuck Berry.

927
01:11:05,674 --> 01:11:09,201
Chuck Berry,
he got locked up for armed robbery.

928
01:11:09,378 --> 01:11:11,642
He changed. He changed.

929
01:11:13,382 --> 01:11:16,909
Barry White, he stole 300 tires.

930
01:11:17,086 --> 01:11:22,217
Can you picture big Barry White
stealing 300 tires? He changed.

931
01:11:22,391 --> 01:11:24,757
You said... You said people don't change.

932
01:11:25,327 --> 01:11:27,727
- People change.
- Eddie.

933
01:11:28,464 --> 01:11:30,830
- What?
- You're killing me.

934
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:34,831
Team three, breach the bus.
Repeat, team three, breach the bus.

935
01:11:35,004 --> 01:11:37,472
<i>Entrance team moving in.</i>

936
01:11:50,586 --> 01:11:53,077
Get out of the way!

937
01:11:53,923 --> 01:11:56,517
Head down!
Cover your ears and your eyes!

938
01:12:02,097 --> 01:12:03,325
- Hold fire.
- Go, go!

939
01:12:03,732 --> 01:12:05,791
- Go, go, go!
- Hold your fire!

940
01:12:05,968 --> 01:12:06,992
This is a nightmare.

941
01:12:23,886 --> 01:12:25,217
Hold fire!

942
01:12:56,752 --> 01:12:58,549
- Let's go! Move, move, move!
- Stay down!

943
01:12:58,721 --> 01:13:00,188
- Move up! Move up!
- Come here.

944
01:13:00,356 --> 01:13:03,086
<i>Team two, status?</i>

945
01:13:03,259 --> 01:13:06,353
Go ahead! Take it! Go!

946
01:13:36,959 --> 01:13:39,223
The bus is empty.

947
01:13:39,395 --> 01:13:41,090
They went through the bus doors!

948
01:13:41,263 --> 01:13:44,892
They're in the goddamn building!
Seal it off!

949
01:13:45,568 --> 01:13:48,435
<i>- All clear. The bus is empty.
- They've entered the building.</i>

950
01:13:50,773 --> 01:13:52,365
Seal the building, start a search.

951
01:13:52,541 --> 01:13:55,009
Remember, heads up.
He just shot two cops. Be careful.

952
01:13:57,346 --> 01:13:59,246
Jack, I gotta tell you something.

953
01:13:59,415 --> 01:14:01,815
Hey, man. Jack, listen to me, man.

954
01:14:01,984 --> 01:14:04,043
Jack, I wanna tell you something.

955
01:14:04,219 --> 01:14:07,916
Hold on, hold on, wait.
I gotta tell you something. It's important.

956
01:14:08,457 --> 01:14:10,925
Shit. Get up, go.

957
01:14:13,128 --> 01:14:15,028
Oh, shit.

958
01:14:16,198 --> 01:14:18,598
Hey, sir. I'm a cop, all right?
I'm on the job.

959
01:14:18,767 --> 01:14:20,792
Look, I need that phone for a minute.

960
01:14:20,970 --> 01:14:22,562
Look what you did to my suit, man.

961
01:14:23,105 --> 01:14:25,733
I told you you was gonna get me shot.

962
01:14:26,742 --> 01:14:28,175
It's me. I need your help.

963
01:14:28,611 --> 01:14:32,707
All this started because my friend
Maurice came by my house.

964
01:14:34,483 --> 01:14:37,941
Two days ago,
Maurice came by my house.

965
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:39,519
He all excited.

966
01:14:39,688 --> 01:14:42,282
He got a shoebox.

967
01:14:42,458 --> 01:14:43,755
He had a gun.

968
01:14:43,926 --> 01:14:46,486
He talking about,
"Hold this for me for a little while. "

969
01:14:46,662 --> 01:14:50,428
I'm like, "I'm on parole. "
He like, "Me too. "

970
01:14:50,599 --> 01:14:54,535
Next day, somebody shot him.

971
01:14:55,838 --> 01:14:58,363
Thirty-two thousand dollars
in that shoebox.

972
01:15:00,476 --> 01:15:03,206
- That's a sign, huh?
- Yeah.

973
01:15:03,379 --> 01:15:05,609
It's a very big sign.

974
01:15:05,781 --> 01:15:08,306
Easy, easy, easy.

975
01:15:12,254 --> 01:15:16,623
You know how much it gonna take me
to open the bakery?

976
01:15:19,028 --> 01:15:21,553
Thirty-one thousand dollars.

977
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:26,463
Jack, I got so nervous
I ran out the house.

978
01:15:26,635 --> 01:15:31,163
I went to Port Authority
and I put the money in a locker.

979
01:15:35,244 --> 01:15:36,506
I get back to my house...

980
01:15:36,679 --> 01:15:39,011
...my parole officer's there...

981
01:15:39,181 --> 01:15:40,808
...in my house.

982
01:15:40,983 --> 01:15:43,816
He got Maurice's gun in his hand.

983
01:15:43,986 --> 01:15:47,251
He looking at me like, "That's it, Eddie. "

984
01:15:47,589 --> 01:15:49,489
And he's talking about 15 years, man.

985
01:15:50,059 --> 01:15:52,027
I got so sick.

986
01:15:52,194 --> 01:15:55,755
Then the DA came to my cell...

987
01:15:57,232 --> 01:16:00,258
...and he showed me
the picture of that cop.

988
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:03,601
Then I met you.

989
01:16:04,139 --> 01:16:09,042
Jack, they clean them lockers out
every 24 hours.

990
01:16:10,479 --> 01:16:12,504
I had a little schedule going, man.

991
01:16:13,882 --> 01:16:16,282
Court at 10:00...

992
01:16:17,319 --> 01:16:19,583
...Port Authority at 12.

993
01:16:19,755 --> 01:16:21,746
Hey. Hey, look at me. Wake up.

994
01:16:22,591 --> 01:16:24,525
You ain't gonna die on me, are you?

995
01:16:26,695 --> 01:16:29,357
I don't know, I never died before.

996
01:16:29,531 --> 01:16:31,829
It's not gonna happen today.

997
01:16:41,910 --> 01:16:43,400
Hey. Thank you for coming.

998
01:16:43,579 --> 01:16:48,414
- What's going on?
- Look. Shot here. I think it went in and out.

999
01:16:48,784 --> 01:16:50,615
Yeah, let's get him in.

1000
01:16:52,855 --> 01:16:54,288
I know you.

1001
01:16:54,456 --> 01:16:56,321
- Come on.
- I was at your house.

1002
01:16:56,492 --> 01:16:58,585
- You were at my apartment?
- Had to get my gun.

1003
01:16:58,761 --> 01:17:00,626
Bigmouth.

1004
01:17:01,196 --> 01:17:04,563
It was very nice, very clean.

1005
01:17:05,634 --> 01:17:08,102
The police grilled me
for an hour at the hospital.

1006
01:17:08,270 --> 01:17:09,498
What'd you say to them?

1007
01:17:09,671 --> 01:17:12,071
That you're a self-medicating,
depressed individual.

1008
01:17:12,241 --> 01:17:14,402
And you don't care
about anything or anyone.

1009
01:17:14,576 --> 01:17:19,070
Oh, she's honest, straightforward.
That's sexy. I like that.

1010
01:17:28,657 --> 01:17:30,181
What'd you do this time, Jack?

1011
01:17:30,359 --> 01:17:33,123
He saved my life a couple times.

1012
01:17:34,429 --> 01:17:39,298
Hey, he's a good dude.
You gotta give him another chance.

1013
01:17:39,468 --> 01:17:42,403
I don't know what he did,
but you gotta give him another chance.

1014
01:17:42,571 --> 01:17:45,005
He gotta have somebody to talk to.

1015
01:17:45,174 --> 01:17:47,699
I'm not gonna be around.

1016
01:17:49,611 --> 01:17:53,206
- Eddie, this is my sister, Diane.
- What?

1017
01:17:53,849 --> 01:17:55,942
She's your sister?

1018
01:17:56,518 --> 01:17:58,349
Oh, man.

1019
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:02,217
I just started having a little hope for you.
Your family don't even like you.

1020
01:18:02,391 --> 01:18:05,053
I got a sister too.

1021
01:18:06,128 --> 01:18:08,858
But she live in Seattle.

1022
01:18:09,031 --> 01:18:11,465
I was supposed to go out there
and start my bakery.

1023
01:18:11,633 --> 01:18:14,158
I was supposed to go out there today
to see her.

1024
01:18:14,336 --> 01:18:16,327
See her on the bus.

1025
01:18:17,072 --> 01:18:18,300
I can stop the bleeding...

1026
01:18:18,473 --> 01:18:20,964
...but he's gotta get stitched up,
get to a hospital.

1027
01:18:21,476 --> 01:18:23,569
We gotta be at the courthouse
in less than 20.

1028
01:18:24,079 --> 01:18:26,240
You're gonna have to do it.

1029
01:18:29,785 --> 01:18:32,481
You're gonna be fine, Eddie.
It's not as bad as it looks.

1030
01:18:34,756 --> 01:18:36,519
What happened to your hand?

1031
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:40,251
I gotta ask you one more favor.

1032
01:18:42,164 --> 01:18:44,689
Just a little favor.

1033
01:18:51,573 --> 01:18:53,871
Hey, is today really your birthday?

1034
01:18:54,042 --> 01:18:55,703
No.

1035
01:18:55,878 --> 01:19:00,474
No, I just said that because the little girl,
she was so scared.

1036
01:19:01,183 --> 01:19:03,378
She was cute, man.

1037
01:19:04,286 --> 01:19:06,220
When's your birthday?

1038
01:19:08,757 --> 01:19:11,590
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

1039
01:19:13,562 --> 01:19:16,258
No, for real, I don't know.

1040
01:19:16,431 --> 01:19:20,367
I'm not... I came up in foster care.
Had a lot of birthdays.

1041
01:19:20,535 --> 01:19:25,370
But didn't you say...? You got a sister, right?
That you're going to see?

1042
01:19:25,540 --> 01:19:28,532
Yeah, I just found out about her
a couple months ago.

1043
01:19:28,710 --> 01:19:30,769
- Never met your sister?
- No.

1044
01:19:32,347 --> 01:19:35,180
That's why I'm going out to Seattle
to meet her.

1045
01:19:36,285 --> 01:19:37,582
I'm looking forward.

1046
01:19:37,753 --> 01:19:40,551
Maybe she turns out
to look like Angelina Jolie.

1047
01:19:40,722 --> 01:19:43,987
Shit, if she do,
I hope she ain't my sister.

1048
01:19:48,363 --> 01:19:50,661
Hey, man, what you want
on your cake, man?

1049
01:19:50,832 --> 01:19:52,993
You never told me.
I gotta send you one, man.

1050
01:19:54,136 --> 01:19:57,003
- I don't want no cake, Eddie.
- Damn it, Jack, come on, man...

1051
01:19:57,172 --> 01:19:59,766
I can't think of anything
that has happened in my life...

1052
01:19:59,942 --> 01:20:03,002
...that I would want written on a cake.
- Nothing?

1053
01:20:05,147 --> 01:20:07,081
I'm not a good guy, Eddie.

1054
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:14,414
I'm not a good guy.

1055
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:20,091
Yeah, me neither.

1056
01:20:34,710 --> 01:20:35,938
- Diane.
- Frank.

1057
01:20:36,111 --> 01:20:37,908
Give me the keys.

1058
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,913
- Stay in the car.
- Little out of your sector, aren't you?

1059
01:20:41,083 --> 01:20:42,710
Saving lives knows no bounds.

1060
01:20:42,884 --> 01:20:45,375
- You should know that, Frank.
- You look good.

1061
01:20:45,554 --> 01:20:47,784
You look a little desperate.
Doesn't suit you.

1062
01:20:47,956 --> 01:20:49,423
Open the door.

1063
01:20:49,591 --> 01:20:51,821
Open the door. Open the door.

1064
01:20:53,261 --> 01:20:55,729
Sorry, Jack, this is as close
as I can get you.

1065
01:21:02,337 --> 01:21:04,464
Like I said, you're looking good.

1066
01:21:09,144 --> 01:21:10,702
Thanks, kid.

1067
01:21:11,813 --> 01:21:13,178
All right, come on, let's go.

1068
01:21:13,348 --> 01:21:15,816
No, hey, hold on. Hold on a minute.

1069
01:21:15,984 --> 01:21:17,383
Why is that? Hold on for what?

1070
01:21:17,552 --> 01:21:19,452
This is as far as you go too.

1071
01:21:19,621 --> 01:21:21,748
- Come on, man. I don't...
- Listen to me, Eddie.

1072
01:21:21,923 --> 01:21:24,357
- What?
- Listen.

1073
01:21:25,761 --> 01:21:28,457
Those guys you were gonna
testify against...

1074
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:30,689
...those cops?
- Yeah?

1075
01:21:32,167 --> 01:21:33,566
I was one of them.

1076
01:21:42,044 --> 01:21:44,444
You were gonna testify against me too.

1077
01:21:47,082 --> 01:21:49,175
I did what they did.

1078
01:21:49,351 --> 01:21:51,819
We did some bad things.

1079
01:21:52,988 --> 01:21:56,185
I did another bad thing when I used you.

1080
01:21:57,426 --> 01:22:01,624
I was gonna let you do
what I should have done.

1081
01:22:01,797 --> 01:22:04,823
What I should have had the courage
to do six years ago.

1082
01:22:10,272 --> 01:22:11,637
I'm sorry.

1083
01:22:16,778 --> 01:22:21,010
You know, if you didn't
come to get me today...

1084
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:24,484
...I'd be dead right now.

1085
01:22:24,653 --> 01:22:26,450
- Right.
- So...

1086
01:22:27,923 --> 01:22:30,517
I was supposed to meet you.

1087
01:22:31,126 --> 01:22:33,356
That was the sign.

1088
01:22:33,762 --> 01:22:35,992
You saved my life, kid.

1089
01:22:40,902 --> 01:22:43,427
Take care of yourself, kid.

1090
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:46,568
Thank you.

1091
01:22:47,109 --> 01:22:50,272
Make cakes, Eddie the baker.

1092
01:22:57,986 --> 01:23:01,786
Oh, yeah. You give the car keys
to your best friend.

1093
01:23:01,957 --> 01:23:04,653
You let him take the old lady
to the hospital.

1094
01:23:04,826 --> 01:23:09,695
You stay at the bus stop with the girl
because she's the girl of your dreams, right?

1095
01:23:09,865 --> 01:23:12,265
So everything's gonna be okay.

1096
01:23:13,168 --> 01:23:15,136
- Right?
- Yeah.

1097
01:23:16,404 --> 01:23:18,634
Have fun in Seattle. Say hi to your sister.

1098
01:23:18,807 --> 01:23:20,399
Yeah.

1099
01:23:24,646 --> 01:23:26,136
Yeah.

1100
01:23:27,449 --> 01:23:30,247
Get him to the Port Authority.
Make sure he gets on that bus.

1101
01:23:30,418 --> 01:23:31,646
- Carl, thanks.
- No problem.

1102
01:23:31,820 --> 01:23:33,219
All right.

1103
01:24:45,794 --> 01:24:47,455
Hell of a morning, huh?

1104
01:24:57,539 --> 01:24:58,801
Where's the wit?

1105
01:25:01,142 --> 01:25:02,473
You're looking at him.

1106
01:25:06,548 --> 01:25:08,413
I let the kid go, Frank.

1107
01:25:09,784 --> 01:25:13,743
- You're not gonna get to him now.
- Bullshit.

1108
01:25:15,457 --> 01:25:16,719
Wouldn't do that.

1109
01:25:26,468 --> 01:25:28,095
So...

1110
01:25:29,938 --> 01:25:31,929
...what do you think
you're gonna tell them?

1111
01:25:33,241 --> 01:25:35,334
Are you gonna tell them everything?

1112
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:38,172
Are you gonna tell them about you too?

1113
01:25:39,748 --> 01:25:41,909
You think that's gonna
make you feel better?

1114
01:25:42,317 --> 01:25:44,046
Nothing's gonna make me feel better.

1115
01:25:44,219 --> 01:25:45,948
Then why?

1116
01:25:47,222 --> 01:25:49,247
Look, Jack, you and me...

1117
01:25:49,424 --> 01:25:54,418
...we did our business in a certain way.

1118
01:25:56,631 --> 01:26:00,158
You never complained
when we cleared the tough cases.

1119
01:26:00,335 --> 01:26:04,101
It didn't bother you
doing any of that until...

1120
01:26:05,473 --> 01:26:08,203
Listen to me, all right? You listen.

1121
01:26:08,376 --> 01:26:11,277
Okay, Jack? Really listen.

1122
01:26:11,446 --> 01:26:14,347
Whatever you think
that you are gonna do up there...

1123
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:17,047
...it is never gonna happen.

1124
01:26:18,019 --> 01:26:20,579
You are not gonna make it.

1125
01:26:22,190 --> 01:26:24,658
Is that what you're thinking, Frank?

1126
01:26:25,193 --> 01:26:29,357
You're gonna shoot me down here?
Nobody knows?

1127
01:26:31,032 --> 01:26:33,626
Like the Ling family, huh?

1128
01:26:33,802 --> 01:26:35,030
Like they never knew.

1129
01:26:35,203 --> 01:26:37,797
He was a stupid old man
who wouldn't keep his mouth shut.

1130
01:26:37,972 --> 01:26:40,497
All right, so I stuck a gun
in some guy's mouth.

1131
01:26:40,675 --> 01:26:44,008
- He had a heart attack, he died. So what?
- So what?

1132
01:26:44,179 --> 01:26:47,376
Look, if it hadn't happened
the way that it did, if he hadn't died...

1133
01:26:47,549 --> 01:26:50,712
...you would've been patting me
on the back, saying, "Good job. "

1134
01:26:50,885 --> 01:26:53,615
Collateral damage,
it is a fact of life in this business.

1135
01:26:53,788 --> 01:26:57,349
He took his last breaths while you were
wiping the fingerprints off the room.

1136
01:26:57,525 --> 01:27:00,460
- He was gonna take down our case.
- He was an innocent man.

1137
01:27:00,628 --> 01:27:03,995
- He was gonna take down our case.
- He was somebody's husband.

1138
01:27:04,165 --> 01:27:06,929
- He was gonna take down our case.
- He was somebody's father.

1139
01:27:07,102 --> 01:27:09,900
He was gonna take down our case!
What were we supposed to do?

1140
01:27:10,071 --> 01:27:13,404
- He wanted to tell the truth.
- Fuck the truth!

1141
01:27:24,252 --> 01:27:25,685
Right.

1142
01:27:44,739 --> 01:27:47,435
I'm not gonna need this anymore.

1143
01:28:32,068 --> 01:28:34,036
<i>Bobby? He's on his way up.</i>

1144
01:28:34,904 --> 01:28:35,893
Take him out.

1145
01:29:09,339 --> 01:29:12,137
Mosley's in the building!
Get the ADA. Freeze!

1146
01:29:12,308 --> 01:29:14,242
- Hands in the air!
- Don't shoot.

1147
01:29:14,410 --> 01:29:16,571
- Don't move! Down on your knees.
- I'm not armed.

1148
01:29:16,746 --> 01:29:19,476
- Down on your knees! Now!
- Don't shoot, I'm not armed.

1149
01:29:19,649 --> 01:29:23,278
Lower your weapon. Just call
ADA MacDonald, please, on the radio.

1150
01:29:23,453 --> 01:29:25,785
- Hands up.
- Get ADA MacDonald here right now!

1151
01:29:25,955 --> 01:29:28,253
- Don't shoot. Don't shoot me.
- Get your hands up!

1152
01:29:28,424 --> 01:29:30,187
Just get ADA MacDonald for me.

1153
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:33,158
- Jack, come on!
- I won't argue with you. Get down.

1154
01:29:33,329 --> 01:29:35,126
Mosley! Mosley!

1155
01:29:35,298 --> 01:29:36,560
Hands up!

1156
01:29:36,733 --> 01:29:38,997
Where's my witness?
Where's Edward Bunker?

1157
01:29:39,602 --> 01:29:41,467
He didn't make it.

1158
01:29:42,305 --> 01:29:43,829
I'm gonna take his place.

1159
01:29:49,445 --> 01:29:52,380
- Please lower your weapons.
- Hold your fire and stand down.

1160
01:29:52,548 --> 01:29:54,175
Back off.

1161
01:29:56,352 --> 01:29:58,479
I have information...

1162
01:29:58,654 --> 01:30:01,885
...regarding your ongoing
witness-tampering investigation.

1163
01:30:02,759 --> 01:30:05,523
Dates, cases that include extortion...

1164
01:30:06,095 --> 01:30:09,121
...manslaughter and possible homicide...

1165
01:30:09,932 --> 01:30:12,799
...involving members
of the 14th Precinct.

1166
01:30:13,903 --> 01:30:17,361
These charges include
Captain Dan Gruber...

1167
01:30:17,707 --> 01:30:19,868
...detectives Jerry Shue...

1168
01:30:20,576 --> 01:30:22,544
...Edward Maldonado...

1169
01:30:23,312 --> 01:30:25,542
...Bob Torres...

1170
01:30:25,715 --> 01:30:27,615
...Jim Mulvey...

1171
01:30:28,918 --> 01:30:30,579
...myself...

1172
01:30:31,654 --> 01:30:33,383
...and Detective Frank Nugent.

1173
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:40,090
What's this about, Mosley?
What do you want?

1174
01:30:40,863 --> 01:30:42,888
I want Edward Bunker's record expunged.

1175
01:30:43,099 --> 01:30:46,330
- Done. What else?
- Nothing else.

1176
01:30:46,502 --> 01:30:48,265
You can substantiate all this, Mosley?

1177
01:30:49,872 --> 01:30:51,339
Yeah.

1178
01:30:52,341 --> 01:30:53,433
Gun!

1179
01:30:59,682 --> 01:31:02,207
Hold your fire. I fired that shot.

1180
01:31:08,024 --> 01:31:11,687
<i>You're gonna shoot me down here?
Nobody knows?</i>

1181
01:31:13,796 --> 01:31:15,423
<i>Like the Ling family, huh?</i>

1182
01:31:16,399 --> 01:31:18,594
<i>Like they never knew.</i>

1183
01:31:18,768 --> 01:31:21,362
<i>He was a stupid old man
who wouldn't keep his mouth shut.</i>

1184
01:31:21,537 --> 01:31:23,971
<i>All right, so I stuck a gun
in some guy's mouth.</i>

1185
01:31:24,140 --> 01:31:27,166
<i>- He had a heart attack, he died. So what?
- So what?</i>

1186
01:31:27,343 --> 01:31:29,436
<i>- So what?
- So how about he was innocent?</i>

1187
01:31:29,612 --> 01:31:32,046
<i>- Innocent?
- How about he didn't deserve to die?</i>

1188
01:31:32,215 --> 01:31:35,707
<i>Look, if it hadn't happened
the way that it did, if he hadn't died...</i>

1189
01:31:35,885 --> 01:31:38,820
<i>...you would've been patting me
on the back, saying, "Good job. "</i>

1190
01:31:38,988 --> 01:31:41,786
<i>Collateral damage,

1191
01:31:41,958 --> 01:31:45,519
<i>He took his last breaths while you were

1192
01:31:45,695 --> 01:31:48,357

1193
01:31:48,531 --> 01:31:51,762

1194
01:31:51,934 --> 01:31:54,698
<i>- He was gonna take down our case.

1196
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:00,832
<i>- He wanted to tell the truth.
- Fuck the truth!</i>

1197
01:32:04,547 --> 01:32:06,708
Let's get you to the jury.

1198
01:32:21,797 --> 01:32:22,821
- Thanks a lot.
- Thanks.

1199
01:32:22,999 --> 01:32:24,261
Okay.

1200
01:32:41,183 --> 01:32:43,549
- Hey, happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, Jack.

1201
01:32:43,719 --> 01:32:45,812
Welcome back, Jack.

1202
01:32:45,988 --> 01:32:48,513
- Are you kidding me?
- Two years in the pen is enough.

1203
01:32:48,691 --> 01:32:50,625
Thanks for that memory. Thank you.

1204
01:32:50,793 --> 01:32:52,624
- Happy birthday, Jack.
- Happy birthday.

1205
01:32:52,795 --> 01:32:55,161
- Happy birthday. Blow them out.
- Welcome home.

1206
01:32:55,331 --> 01:32:57,891
I hate birthdays, you know that, right?

1207
01:32:59,835 --> 01:33:02,497
- Sorry, sorry.
- Happy birthday.

1208
01:33:12,481 --> 01:33:14,278
This came with it.

1209
01:33:25,861 --> 01:33:27,852
<i>Dear Jack Mosley:</i>

1210
01:33:28,030 --> 01:33:32,626
<i>I hope you're doing well and everything
worked out like it was supposed to.</i>

1211
01:33:32,802 --> 01:33:34,827
<i>I'm doing great.</i>

1212
01:33:35,004 --> 01:33:36,995
<i>Seattle is different, and I like it a lot.</i>

1213
01:33:37,173 --> 01:33:41,542
<i>I'm not sure I ever smelled fresh air
before I got here. It's a trip.</i>

1214
01:33:41,711 --> 01:33:45,169
<i>Sometimes I can't believe it.
It's the best feeling I've had in my life.</i>

1215
01:33:45,848 --> 01:33:47,748
<i>I'm busting my ass,
but I'm happy, though.</i>

1216
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:53,711
<i>The bakery is now open. Three cheers.</i>

1217
01:33:55,524 --> 01:33:58,220
<i>I put my name first
because I'm doing all the hard work.</i>

1218
01:33:58,394 --> 01:34:00,453
<i>These ovens are hot, man.</i>

1219
01:34:00,630 --> 01:34:02,996
<i>Hope you like the cake.
What did I tell you?</i>

1220
01:34:03,165 --> 01:34:07,499
<i>- That's Eddie.
- If you're ever in town, you got a friend.</i>

1221
01:34:07,670 --> 01:34:10,696
<i>Thank you for doing the right thing,
Jack Mosley. God bless you.</i>

1222
01:34:11,207 --> 01:34:14,938
<i>Keep in touch. Peace.</i>

1223
01:34:15,111 --> 01:34:17,341
- That's great.
- Go on, take one more. Look.

1224
01:34:17,513 --> 01:34:21,916
You know how this guy...?
