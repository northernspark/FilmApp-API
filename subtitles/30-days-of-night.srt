Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

2
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,908
Strange.

3
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,994
Who'd do something like this?

4
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:26,415
Maybe someone got a little upset
about their roaming charges.

5
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:31,086
Stealing satellite phones
makes sense. You can hock them.

6
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,049
You can run up charges
on somebody else's account.

7
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:37,676
But burning them?

8
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:39,678
Youngsters?

9
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,722
Pulling some prank?

10
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,599
No.

11
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,310
They'd have left a note.

12
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:49,230
"Fuck you" to their parents...

13
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,941
...or the world or whatever.

14
00:03:58,364 --> 00:04:00,407
Not a bad idea, though.

15
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,135
I brought Peggy here
on our first date.

16
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:22,263
Yeah, we all did.

17
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,725
Not Peggy, of course.

18
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:30,813
Yeah, I got you.

19
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,443
Last sunset in a month...

20
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,070
...always works.

21
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,744
Come on. Let's go do the sign.

22
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:50,666
You okay, Eben?

23
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:55,004
Yeah.

24
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:36,628
Why do you even bother with that?
Nobody's gonna see it for a month.

25
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,130
It's tradition.

26
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,152
Put this off till the last minute,
didn't you?

27
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,030
There's a lot of small towns
in this state.

28
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:07,076
My boss wants all his gear inspected
and certified by the 31st.

29
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:10,287
And I noticed you saved
Barrow for the last.

30
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,209
You sure you don't wanna stay?

31
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,669
Me and Jeannie were hoping
you and Eben...

32
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:21,423
...might rethink
this separation thing.

33
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:25,594
Thanks.

34
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,471
I...

35
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:30,307
...gotta make the plane.

36
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:42,569
Okay, sweetie. I know you can't
handle a month with no sun.

37
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,697
I promise I won't live on
Oreos and Snapple, all right?

38
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:52,871
Have fun in Seattle.

39
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:57,709
Yeah. So long, Kirsten.
I'll call you when I get there.

40
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:00,963
Goodbye.

41
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,005
Got a problem?

42
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:47,342
Nothing I can't handle
my own fucking self.

43
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,309
This for generators?

44
00:07:57,728 --> 00:07:59,855
Yeah. Yeah, mostly.

45
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,359
Beau, I have to cite you for it.
I can't have it leaking on the street.

46
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,239
What?

47
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:13,744
For that? You don't--

48
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:17,915
You don't have to cite me.

49
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:21,001
You don't have to do anything.

50
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:26,131
Isn't that why we live out here?

51
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,967
You know, for a little freedom?

52
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,638
Happy motoring.

53
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:40,896
Yeah, I'll add it to my collection.

54
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:47,569
You know, Beau's not so bad.
Why'd you bother writing him up?

55
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,865
He lives all alone out there
on the south ridge.

56
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:56,203
A little citation now and then
lets him know he's a part of this town.

57
00:08:57,663 --> 00:09:00,249
<i>Eben? Come in, Eben.</i>

58
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:03,752
Yeah, Helen.

59
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:07,089
<i>Something bad's happened
to John Riis' dogs.</i>

60
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:18,976
<i>Well, folks, you're listening
to KBRW, Barrow, Alaska.</i>

61
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,269
<i>Today's the last</i> day--

62
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:26,108
<i>I'm leaving too, getting
on that last plane out of here.</i>

63
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,048
Hey, Stella, are you okay?

64
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,470
Damn it, Malekai.

65
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,557
Don't you know what
"right of way" means?

66
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:00,142
I'm sorry, Stella.

67
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,352
The brakes jammed and...

68
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,856
Eben wanted this back from the airport
before the storm hit, and I was--

69
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:09,151
Oh, shit.
Who's gonna run me to the airport?

70
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,653
Well, wouldn't Eben?

71
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,574
My mom could come down
and give you a tow...

72
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:18,076
...but, you know,
she don't move too fast.

73
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,245
Fuck! Where's my phone?

74
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,149
It's me.

75
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:51,693
Surprise.

76
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:58,367
L-- I need a ride to the airport.

77
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,410
What?

78
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,289
You're in town,
and you didn't wanna talk?

79
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:09,544
<i>I had fire-marshal work here,
and I just had a little accident.</i>

80
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:12,089
I'm stuck on Ransom and 355.
The airport'll close...

81
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,424
...and I'll never get to Anchorage.

82
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:22,015
I mean, if you wanna talk,
we can do it on the drive.

83
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:27,938
Hey, Billy.

84
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:30,107
Stella's stuck at Ransom and 355.

85
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:33,151
She needs a ride to the airport.
Can you go get her?

86
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,741
Yeah.

87
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,160
John Riis needs me
for something...

88
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,454
...so Billy's gonna come get you.

89
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,709
Let me know if a day comes
when you do wanna talk.

90
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,117
What sick jerk would do this?

91
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:26,037
Every kennel. Every dog we had.

92
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,999
Did you fight with anyone
recently, John?

93
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:36,298
I'll kill them. I'll kill them.

94
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:39,634
This wasn't done long ago.

95
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:45,432
I'll find them. Okay?

96
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:53,607
You'll be okay, Malekai.

97
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:02,282
- Where have you been?
-I couldn't find the damn car keys.

98
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:06,703
Then I was like, "Wait, was that
Rogers and 355 or Ransom?"

99
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,997
- And then--
-Yeah, never mind. Let's go.

100
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,962
It would be a lot easier
if you just played, Grandma.

101
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:20,509
Oh, I don't really care for those sort of
games, if you wanna know the truth.

102
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,512
Try your brother.

103
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,808
- What?
-Eben, do you wanna play?

104
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:31,520
I can't right now, Jake. Sorry.

105
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:35,023
While you were busy with John Riis,
Carter and Wilson called...

106
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,901
...about a vandalism problem
at the Utilidor.

107
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,572
Thanks.

108
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,662
Call Point Hope and Wainwright.
See if they're having any troubles.

109
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,220
No.

110
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:11,059
I am not trapped here for a month.

111
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:22,070
- There's someone you can bunk with.
-Don't start, Billy.

112
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:26,032
Peggy and me can put two girls in one
room. You'd have a place of your own.

113
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:29,744
I can't stay here. I've got bills
to put in the mail. My plants'll die.

114
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:31,997
It'll all work out.

115
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,417
Of course, the price
of staying at my place...

116
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:39,129
...is explaining to me and Peggy
just what is wrong with you and Eben.

117
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:48,346
Not enough time this century
to cover that, Billy.

118
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:15,874
Eben, how you doing?

119
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,584
- Good to see you.
-Hey, Carter.

120
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,628
Lord, it's gotta be
10 below out here.

121
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,963
- Eben.
-Wilson.

122
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,682
Can't your wife bring you up
a sweater or two?

123
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,685
Bring the whole tribe up
while she's at it?

124
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:38,939
They'll come when they're ready,
l guess.

125
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:40,815
So...

126
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:44,611
...I've found all kinds of garbage
in here over the years.

127
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,988
Blue jeans, bikes...

128
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:50,659
Sometimes I can yank them out before
the muffin monster chews them to shit.

129
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:52,786
The muffin monster?

130
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,712
I saw Wilson's helicopter logo.

131
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,298
Pulled that stuff out
before it got totally trashed.

132
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,764
You keep your copter
under lock and key, don't you?

133
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:16,601
Yeah, I put it in dry dock
when the tourists headed south.

134
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:19,938
I haven't looked at it for days.
They ripped out the throttle...

135
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:22,691
...the rotors,
half the fucking helicopter!

136
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,609
It's my life, Eben.

137
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:28,571
Why would someone
rip the hell out of my bird?

138
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:02,123
Hey! Stop!

139
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,710
Stop! Stop!

140
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:07,253
Who are you people?

141
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,271
No whiskey?

142
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:27,524
No rum?

143
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,442
Alcohol's illegal this month.

144
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:34,405
Folks have a hard enough time in the
dark without booze making it worse.

145
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:39,327
Well, forget about the liquor...

146
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,329
."Lucy.

147
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:44,124
Just bring me a bowl of...

148
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,168
...raw hamburger.

149
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:51,506
You can only get meat two ways
around here, frozen or burnt.

150
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:58,054
You don't bring me what I wanna eat,
what I wanna drink.

151
00:18:58,221 --> 00:19:00,306
That's enough, pal.

152
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:02,600
Leave the lady be.

153
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:29,544
Hey, what do you say the two of us
go outside and have a little talk, huh?

154
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:36,718
Well, now, what's wrong with a man
wanting a little fresh meat?

155
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:41,848
Come on. You and me, let's go.

156
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:47,187
I'm taking you outside.

157
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,564
I would like to see that.

158
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,027
I would too.

159
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:58,740
But then Lucy'd have to clean up
after Eben kicked your ass.

160
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:05,163
It's more trouble than you're worth.

161
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:13,171
Hey, be nice!

162
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:17,258
Enough.

163
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:18,927
Stay down.

164
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:24,933
Fire marshal's office lets you carry
one of those things?

165
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:28,478
It's a funny thing, I never asked.

166
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:31,272
So you missed your flight?

167
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:34,442
That sucks. Where you gonna stay?

168
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,243
Billy and Peggy are putting me up.

169
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:49,958
Well, I'll talk to you sometime,
l guess.

170
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:54,629
Hey, listen.

171
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:59,926
Look, maybe I'll come along
and say hi to Jake and Helen.

172
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:05,598
Bye,Luce.

173
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:18,027
We haven't seen vandalism
like this in a long time.

174
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:22,031
Don't you know how to take care
of this town without me?

175
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,669
Malekai totaled my car.

176
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,422
Hell of a day.

177
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:39,674
Just you wait.

178
00:21:55,857 --> 00:21:57,650
Hey, Jake.

179
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:07,243
- Where are we going?
-I'm heading back to your house.

180
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,453
My landlady...

181
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:11,372
...doesn't want pipeline workers
keeping her up all night.

182
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,166
Denise is right.

183
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:16,836
- Let's head back to my place.
-Neither of you are getting me alone.

184
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:18,588
Neither!

185
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:22,216
We share, right?
None of us have to be greedy.

186
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:26,054
- Yeah, come on. We'll be good.
-Oh, you will?

187
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,849
- Where's the fun in that, Gabe?
-You bad little bitch.

188
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:31,893
All right, all right,
Rock, Paper, Scissors.

189
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:35,521
- Whoever wins, we go to his place.
-Good idea. Let's do it.

190
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,565
- Come on.
-Hurry up, let's get moving.

191
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:40,026
On three.

192
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:42,195
One, two--

193
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:47,033
Gabe?

194
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:50,953
Gabe?

195
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:52,914
Gabe!

196
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:15,353
Let me tell you what I got.

197
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,564
You don't work at the refinery.

198
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,027
You didn't fly in.
Somebody'd have seen you.

199
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:26,697
And you're definitely
not from around here.

200
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:28,866
How'd you get in?

201
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,709
All right.

202
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:45,425
We got a long time to figure this out.
Nobody's coming for you for a month.

203
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:06,154
Jake, come here a second.

204
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:15,455
What the hell is that?

205
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:19,834
It's pot. It helps her with her cancer.

206
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:23,838
Didn't tell you I got a little greenhouse
at home. Didn't want you arresting me.

207
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,010
Now I know why you wanted
to live with Grandma.

208
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:31,971
No, I just thought you and Stella
ought to have some privacy.

209
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:34,015
Well, that worked out.

210
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:38,352
Computer's down.

211
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,398
I'll call Gus.

212
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:49,197
Strange.

213
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,658
The phone's down too.

214
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:56,287
Mr. and Mrs. Sheriff.

215
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:59,540
So sweet.

216
00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:01,501
So...

217
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:05,671
...helpless against what is coming.

218
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:09,967
He's just trying to freak us out.

219
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,178
It's working.

220
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:16,390
We have more important things
to think about.

221
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:19,727
<i>- I'll</i> check on Gus.
- Check on Gus.

222
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:22,396
Bar the windows.

223
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:24,398
Try to hide.

224
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:26,734
They're coming.

225
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:32,740
This time they gonna
take me with them, honor me.

226
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:37,411
Yeah. For all that I have done.

227
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:39,997
"They"?

228
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:45,378
Who are "they"?

229
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:59,433
The generator's kicked in.

230
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:19,078
- I'm heading out to the cell tower.
-We have to stay here with him?

231
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:22,540
Sure. We'll keep an eye on him.

232
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,793
As soon as the lines are back up,
get Billy over here.

233
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,838
Stay on the walkie-talkie with me
until the power's back.

234
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:51,652
Gus!

235
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,497
Gus?

236
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:39,700
This is Sheriff Eben Oleson.
Stay in your homes, lock your doors...

237
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:43,037
...and load your firearms.
This is not a drill.

238
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:47,041
- Is your genny up and running?
-Yeah.

239
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:51,170
Anyone with a genny should go home
immediately, just to be safe.

240
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:53,798
If you don't have one,
you should meet at the diner.

241
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:56,801
I heard gunshots, Eben.
What the hell is going on?

242
00:27:57,051 --> 00:27:58,636
I don't know.

243
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:03,891
Just go home.
I'll let you know when I find out, okay?

244
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:05,226
Okay.

245
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:10,564
Come on, guys. Let's go.

246
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:19,407
Let's just have dinner, John.

247
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,162
Please?

248
00:28:46,434 --> 00:28:48,811
John!John!

249
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,271
- Ally!
-John!

250
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:53,357
No! No! John!

251
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:58,028
John!

252
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:08,372
John!

253
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:10,499
No!

254
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,628
John!

255
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:16,380
Ally! Ally!

256
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:20,050
- John! John!
-Ally!

257
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:21,427
-Oh, my God!
-Ally?'

258
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:24,346
- John! John!
-Ally!

259
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:27,600
Oh, my God. No!

260
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:32,480
No way out of town.

261
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:34,815
No one to come help.

262
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:37,026
- Shut up.
-Ignore him, Jake.

263
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:40,321
You can feel it.

264
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:47,119
That cold ain't the weather,
that's death approaching.

265
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:51,957
Who you think
they gonna take first?

266
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:58,631
The girl who thinks
a gun will help her?

267
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:02,092
The kid, sheriff's kid?
Or the old gal?

268
00:30:02,343 --> 00:30:04,053
Shut up!

269
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,141
Yeah.

270
00:30:10,351 --> 00:30:13,020
Thank you for the plastique.

271
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:17,399
I can snap that apart
and pick the lock.

272
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:20,694
- No, you won't.
-Jake, he can't. Jake.

273
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:24,073
Jake.

274
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:36,001
You shithead.

275
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:39,046
Helen, get the first-aid kit.

276
00:30:50,808 --> 00:30:55,020
All right, time to talk.
Who are you here with?

277
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:56,814
Who are you here with?

278
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:02,736
Who did that to Gus?

279
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:07,241
You're a dead man.

280
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:09,535
Where are they?!

281
00:31:10,578 --> 00:31:12,997
I don't talk to dead men.

282
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:16,500
I don't talk to dead men!

283
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:21,755
Well, if I'm dead,
no one lets you loose from here.

284
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:24,258
You're all dead!

285
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:34,768
I can take care of that for now,
but Doc Miller--

286
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:38,689
No. Wait till the power's back.
Call Doc Miller then.

287
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:41,525
This fucker doesn't deserve
anything till then.

288
00:31:48,032 --> 00:31:53,120
Billy and I'll work our way
from South Street to the pipeline.

289
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:58,459
His friends don't have
many places to hide.

290
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:01,128
I'll join you.

291
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:03,464
No, we got it.

292
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:08,677
Right now, you, me and Billy
are the authorities.

293
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:11,472
It'd be stupid not to take more help.

294
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:14,516
We got walkie-talkies. We'll be fine.

295
00:32:17,186 --> 00:32:20,648
There's a Taser in the back.
If he gives you any trouble...

296
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:23,317
...use it. Okay?

297
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:26,028
You drive. I'm riding shotgun.

298
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,286
- Stop the truck.
-What?

299
00:32:34,662 --> 00:32:35,829
Stop the fucking truck.

300
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:50,511
I thought I saw something.

301
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:05,192
- Get in the truck.
-What?

302
00:33:05,693 --> 00:33:06,902
Get in the fucking truck!

303
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:21,917
- Jesus Christ!
-Fuck!

304
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,553
- Holy shit!
-Fuck!

305
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:46,233
What the hell was that?

306
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:05,502
Shit! What was that?
Where was that? Where was that?

307
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:08,047
<i>No!</i>

308
00:34:08,297 --> 00:34:09,506
<i>- Helen!
- Help!</i>

309
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:12,593
Helen! Helen, come in!

310
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:21,393
Jake'?

311
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:22,936
Helen?

312
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:26,148
Are you here?

313
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:30,944
Oh, shit.

314
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:47,294
They didn't take me.

315
00:34:53,634 --> 00:34:55,594
Who did they take?

316
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:59,431
They didn't take me.

317
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:07,272
Did they take my brother?

318
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:22,204
Finish me off.

319
00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:29,086
Finish me.

320
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:33,799
Eben.

321
00:35:35,676 --> 00:35:37,678
Eben, look at me.

322
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:40,681
No.

323
00:36:43,577 --> 00:36:45,454
What are they?

324
00:36:48,582 --> 00:36:50,375
We don't know.

325
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:54,421
- Wilson, I wanna go home.
-it's okay. Dad!

326
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:57,758
-It's okay.
-You keep shooting and they just...

327
00:36:58,217 --> 00:36:59,635
They just keep coming.

328
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:02,763
- How is that possible?
-I don't know.

329
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:05,974
Maybe they're all coked up
on PCP or something, you know.

330
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:08,268
They don't feel any bullets.

331
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,653
They killed every sled dog in town.

332
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:23,283
They took Aaron and Gabe.

333
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:25,118
They killed my grandmother.

334
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:08,555
What are you? What are you?

335
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:13,578
- Lucy, is the back door locked? Okay.
-All locked.

336
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:17,124
Jake'?

337
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:22,003
- Eben!Eben!
-Jake.

338
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:26,967
- Who the hell are these people, Eben?
-What do they want?

339
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:35,434
We'll figure that out when we
get you guys someplace safe.

340
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,854
There's a generator at the Utilidor.

341
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:42,816
No, that's way out on the edge of town.
We need someplace close to hide.

342
00:40:42,983 --> 00:40:43,984
Now.

343
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:48,280
Charlie Kelso's attic.

344
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:51,491
It has a pull-down ladder.
You can't tell it's there.

345
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:54,828
He would've boarded up
his home before he left.

346
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,289
Which is exactly why
it's a good idea.

347
00:40:57,747 --> 00:41:00,959
We'll pull down a board to get in,
then we'll tack it back.

348
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,711
Carter.

349
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:09,593
I want you to lead everybody
close to the buildings.

350
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,970
If you hear anything,
roll under a crawlspace.

351
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:15,724
Go straight to Kelso's attic.
I'll meet you there.

352
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:17,893
What are you gonna do?

353
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:24,357
I'm gonna load up with as many bear
traps and flares as a 4x4 can carry.

354
00:41:24,858 --> 00:41:27,152
Something's gotta slow them down.

355
00:41:32,908 --> 00:41:34,326
I'm coming with you.

356
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:37,913
Okay.

357
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,731
- Fuck!
-Oh, shit!

358
00:42:05,232 --> 00:42:06,233
Shit!

359
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:15,325
Fuck!

360
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:19,120
Shit!

361
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:36,096
Eben!

362
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:40,517
No!

363
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:47,065
Go! Get out of here!

364
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:50,610
Shit. Shit. Shit.

365
00:42:58,243 --> 00:42:59,786
Move it. Move it!

366
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:03,290
Come on!

367
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:13,383
Go!

368
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:21,975
- What the hell is going on?
-I don't know.

369
00:43:22,142 --> 00:43:25,186
- We gotta lose this thing.
-And go where?

370
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:27,689
We know a place.

371
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:45,874
Okay.

372
00:43:57,469 --> 00:43:58,803
Go.

373
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,992
These seem to work.

374
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:25,955
It's well hidden.

375
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:40,720
Hey.

376
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,562
Two, three.

377
00:45:25,724 --> 00:45:27,642
I saw them...

378
00:45:29,102 --> 00:45:31,896
...feed on Grandma Helen.

379
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:37,068
They're like vampires, you know?

380
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:41,114
Vampires don't exist, Jake.

381
00:45:42,157 --> 00:45:44,242
They don't fall
when you shoot them.

382
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:46,536
Hell, neither do I.

383
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:51,040
Well, I don't care what they are.
I just care what we do about them.

384
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:54,419
What are we gonna do about them?

385
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:00,592
We'll sleep in shifts.

386
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:06,014
We'll ration our food, and then
we'll figure out the next step.

387
00:46:08,558 --> 00:46:12,270
We have two advantages.
We know this town...

388
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:14,272
...and we know the cold.

389
00:46:15,482 --> 00:46:17,150
We live here for a reason.

390
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:21,446
Because nobody else can.

391
00:46:29,162 --> 00:46:31,206
Yeah, right.

392
00:47:59,586 --> 00:48:02,338
I guess it's good
you didn't want kids, huh?

393
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:05,425
Imagine.

394
00:48:08,177 --> 00:48:10,513
Where--? Where's Catherine?
Where's Catherine?

395
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,099
- Dad. Dad. Dad.
-What?

396
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:16,603
Dad, Mom died a long time ago.

397
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:20,356
Isaac“.

398
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:24,903
...you should go to sleep now.
You should go to sleep.

399
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:29,365
That's right. That's right.
You should go to sleep.

400
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:33,870
Thank you.

401
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:54,390
They're ransacking
the Clarks' place.

402
00:48:55,224 --> 00:48:57,143
They're tearing through
everyone's home.

403
00:48:57,393 --> 00:49:00,855
- We have to move.
-When do you suggest we do that?

404
00:49:01,314 --> 00:49:04,275
Now, while we have the strength.

405
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:08,279
Until we have some way to stop them,
it's suicide, Lucy.

406
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:11,074
We can stay here
until they find us...

407
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,284
...and they can kill us all,
or we can run.

408
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:16,079
Some won't make it,
but it's better than all of us dying!

409
00:49:16,245 --> 00:49:18,081
- Shut up!
-Doug, you should sit down.

410
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:19,582
Maybe Denise or Lucy dies...

411
00:49:19,749 --> 00:49:22,085
...but that's okay so long as
you have a chance?

412
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:24,337
- Hey. Hey.
-Hey.

413
00:49:32,345 --> 00:49:33,596
Stupid.

414
00:49:40,853 --> 00:49:44,691
Start a fight, that'll get us all
killed a lot faster.

415
00:49:55,702 --> 00:49:56,828
Okay.

416
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:05,628
We go to the general store to get
supplies, then we go to the Utilidor.

417
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:13,636
But we'll never make it there
without cover.

418
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:18,599
We get there,
we can last the month.

419
00:50:19,267 --> 00:50:21,811
The next blizzard, we'll be ready.

420
00:50:31,696 --> 00:50:33,614
Hello!

421
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:37,076
Somebody!

422
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:45,293
Help!

423
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:47,962
Come on.

424
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:52,091
Help!

425
00:50:53,593 --> 00:50:55,762
Please!

426
00:50:56,888 --> 00:50:58,931
Anyone?

427
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:02,685
Hello?

428
00:51:05,354 --> 00:51:07,398
Anyone?

429
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:10,109
Help!

430
00:51:13,613 --> 00:51:15,615
We need to get her in
before they find her.

431
00:51:15,782 --> 00:51:17,533
- Wait.
-What?

432
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:20,620
Look at the rooftops behind her.

433
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:28,252
Please!

434
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:34,467
They're using her as bait.

435
00:52:03,162 --> 00:52:04,622
Please.

436
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:08,334
Please, no. I tried.

437
00:52:08,501 --> 00:52:10,294
There isn't anybody left.

438
00:52:16,134 --> 00:52:17,969
Please.

439
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:22,431
Please, God. Please.

440
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:43,953
No God.

441
00:53:03,431 --> 00:53:04,682
Eben.

442
00:53:13,316 --> 00:53:14,942
Eben!

443
00:53:22,033 --> 00:53:23,492
<i>I'll come to you.</i>

444
00:54:05,952 --> 00:54:08,704
I've known Kirsten my whole life.

445
00:54:09,205 --> 00:54:10,248
I'm going out.

446
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:12,333
Why we waiting?
While they're feeding...

447
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,585
...we could make a run for it.

448
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:17,296
- I can kill these things.
-We'll die in here otherwise.

449
00:54:17,463 --> 00:54:19,257
Eben doesn't know what he's doing!

450
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:20,424
- Just move.
-Beau.

451
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:22,677
We agreed to keep
the bigger weapon here.

452
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:25,346
- Just move!
-We need you here.

453
00:54:35,815 --> 00:54:37,483
Okay.

454
00:54:37,692 --> 00:54:39,735
Okay. Okay.

455
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:52,748
John.

456
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:56,335
How long have you
been under there?

457
00:54:57,336 --> 00:54:58,587
I'm not sure.

458
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:00,673
Where's Ally?

459
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:04,010
Took Ally.

460
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:05,970
Couldn't follow.

461
00:55:07,138 --> 00:55:08,848
You're okay?

462
00:55:10,975 --> 00:55:14,395
- The leg hurts.
-Okay.

463
00:55:15,521 --> 00:55:18,316
I know a safe place.

464
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:22,278
I'm gonna pull you out.
But stay quiet.

465
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:26,032
Come on.

466
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,202
So hungry-

467
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:33,664
Yeah, we'll get you
something to eat. Yeah.

468
00:55:40,546 --> 00:55:42,256
What happened to you?

469
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:44,717
Shit!

470
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:54,894
Eben.

471
00:55:56,062 --> 00:55:57,229
Come on.

472
00:56:01,609 --> 00:56:03,402
John.

473
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:14,038
John! Stay back! Stay back!

474
00:56:17,375 --> 00:56:18,584
John.

475
00:56:19,919 --> 00:56:21,295
Stay back!

476
00:57:18,102 --> 00:57:19,687
Are you hurt?

477
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:21,981
- There's blood.
-He can't breathe.

478
00:57:22,148 --> 00:57:24,150
I'm okay. I'm okay.

479
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:26,318
Where's your inhaler?

480
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:30,489
- I lost it.
-Oh, shit.

481
00:57:37,496 --> 00:57:39,915
John Riis became one of them.

482
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:38,974
Isaac.

483
00:58:43,562 --> 00:58:46,148
No. Isaac.

484
00:58:46,357 --> 00:58:48,651
I'm walking to Wainwright.

485
00:58:48,943 --> 00:58:51,111
It's 80 miles.
There's no way to get there.

486
00:58:52,404 --> 00:58:54,615
- Just go back upstairs.
-Wilson.

487
00:58:54,782 --> 00:58:57,993
Come on down. We need to get
out of here. Bring your mother too.

488
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,746
- Okay, we'll die if you go out there.
-No!

489
00:59:00,913 --> 00:59:05,084
No. I'll die if I stay here. That's what's
gonna happen. Leave me alone.

490
00:59:06,585 --> 00:59:07,711
What's she doing?

491
00:59:08,254 --> 00:59:10,756
Just-- Just keep quiet.

492
00:59:12,925 --> 00:59:15,302
- I'm sorry.
-it's all right.

493
00:59:19,098 --> 00:59:21,100
Let's just go back upstairs.

494
00:59:21,267 --> 00:59:23,602
Can I--? There's a bathroom?

495
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:26,480
No-- Okay, remember
you can't flush.

496
00:59:26,647 --> 00:59:29,024
We'll just open the valve afterwards.

497
00:59:50,462 --> 00:59:53,299
Who would have thought
we'd make it this long, huh?

498
00:59:53,465 --> 00:59:54,800
We're ahead of the curve.

499
00:59:54,967 --> 00:59:57,720
Every day they need more food.
They'll be back.

500
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:05,644
Dad? Dad?

501
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:07,313
Dad!

502
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:09,481
No noise!

503
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:20,409
- Wait! You can't just rush out.
-He's my father.

504
01:00:20,701 --> 01:00:22,077
Wait! No!

505
01:00:50,439 --> 01:00:52,900
Stella, are you all right?
What happened?

506
01:00:53,067 --> 01:00:56,028
Isaac went to Wainwright.

507
01:00:56,862 --> 01:01:00,449
- Wilson went to find him.
-How long you been down here?

508
01:01:32,981 --> 01:01:34,900
Dad!

509
01:01:50,249 --> 01:01:51,834
Dad!

510
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:09,810
Dad!

511
01:02:13,439 --> 01:02:15,357
Dad!

512
01:02:53,145 --> 01:02:55,355
I should've fought harder.

513
01:02:57,649 --> 01:02:59,735
Kept Wilson here.

514
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:05,657
It's hard to stop someone
when their family's at stake.

515
01:03:09,328 --> 01:03:11,538
The things you'll do
to save your own.

516
01:03:13,499 --> 01:03:15,751
We were like that once.

517
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:19,254
Weren't we?

518
01:03:59,378 --> 01:04:01,088
It's gone.

519
01:04:03,549 --> 01:04:04,925
It's snowing.

520
01:04:05,717 --> 01:04:08,387
As soon as it's safe,
we have to move.

521
01:05:25,464 --> 01:05:27,424
You four, canned goods.

522
01:05:27,633 --> 01:05:30,552
Stella, Carter, propane, batteries.

523
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:34,932
Jake, medical supplies. We meet
back here in two minutes. Let's go.

524
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:04,670
I promised my wife I wouldn't live
on these things while she was gone.

525
01:06:04,836 --> 01:06:06,254
She'll cut you slack.

526
01:06:31,822 --> 01:06:33,699
Oh, God.

527
01:06:37,703 --> 01:06:40,205
I'm done playing with this one.

528
01:06:41,707 --> 01:06:43,750
You wanna play with me now?

529
01:06:45,335 --> 01:06:46,670
Come on!

530
01:06:52,009 --> 01:06:53,051
What?

531
01:06:55,178 --> 01:06:57,055
Okay.

532
01:06:57,889 --> 01:06:59,349
Wait.

533
01:07:55,697 --> 01:07:57,240
Somebody!

534
01:07:57,449 --> 01:07:59,201
Somebody get the ax!

535
01:08:16,718 --> 01:08:18,929
She was just a girl.

536
01:08:24,518 --> 01:08:26,520
You did the right thing.

537
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:36,655
It's okay.

538
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:50,794
Who was she?

539
01:08:51,962 --> 01:08:54,256
I mean, does anybody
recognize her?

540
01:08:54,714 --> 01:08:56,174
No.

541
01:08:56,716 --> 01:08:57,843
No.

542
01:09:01,346 --> 01:09:03,140
The whiteout's over.

543
01:09:14,109 --> 01:09:16,361
We have to move.

544
01:09:16,528 --> 01:09:18,655
We can't stay here.

545
01:09:18,822 --> 01:09:21,283
But the Utilidor's too far
without cover.

546
01:09:26,705 --> 01:09:27,789
Eben?

547
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:33,420
Could we make it to your station
if somebody created a diversion?

548
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:39,217
How?

549
01:09:42,637 --> 01:09:45,098
These things can't survive the sun.

550
01:09:45,849 --> 01:09:47,934
What if we brought the sun early?

551
01:09:50,061 --> 01:09:51,855
Helen had that operation at home.

552
01:09:52,189 --> 01:09:55,275
Yeah. She used an ultraviolet light
to grow the stuff.

553
01:09:55,442 --> 01:09:59,279
Yeah. I can run for her place,
let them follow me.

554
01:09:59,446 --> 01:10:03,074
Hit them with the sun lamp while the
rest of you go to the sheriff's station.

555
01:10:03,241 --> 01:10:05,285
Just because something
stopped Bela Lugosi...

556
01:10:05,452 --> 01:10:08,205
...doesn't mean it can stop
these things.

557
01:10:08,371 --> 01:10:11,583
Why would they send that stranger
to cut us off...

558
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:13,960
...if they can handle the light?

559
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:16,463
What if it doesn't work?

560
01:10:20,508 --> 01:10:22,260
It has to.

561
01:10:28,683 --> 01:10:30,310
I'll do it.

562
01:10:31,436 --> 01:10:33,438
- I'm the fastest.
-Bullshit.

563
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:36,691
I weigh less than you
and I know Grandma's house.

564
01:10:36,858 --> 01:10:40,445
- You're 15 years old. Forget about it.
-I'm 15. Right.

565
01:10:40,612 --> 01:10:43,323
- You've got a wife. People need you.
-Jake.

566
01:10:44,157 --> 01:10:46,326
I saw you in the back with the ax.

567
01:10:47,827 --> 01:10:50,664
You think you're up to doing that
three or four more times?

568
01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:54,251
You don't even think
this plan'll work.

569
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:56,169
Yeah, but you do.

570
01:10:58,129 --> 01:10:59,464
I'm going.

571
01:11:00,048 --> 01:11:01,967
I'll see you at the station.

572
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:04,970
You'll need to start her genny first.

573
01:11:07,055 --> 01:11:08,431
See you soon.

574
01:11:17,399 --> 01:11:19,442
Hey!

575
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,210
- Come on.
-Go, go, go.

576
01:11:42,132 --> 01:11:43,550
Hey!

577
01:11:44,259 --> 01:11:46,511
Come on, motherfuckers!

578
01:11:49,514 --> 01:11:50,640
Hey!

579
01:12:19,336 --> 01:12:21,796
Come on. Come on.

580
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:54,037
Come on!

581
01:13:13,348 --> 01:13:15,183
Let me check.

582
01:13:19,854 --> 01:13:22,023
Okay, quick. Come in.

583
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:26,403
Come on, Stella.

584
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:39,350
<i>You there?</i>

585
01:14:41,352 --> 01:14:44,814
Yeah. Yeah, it worked.

586
01:14:45,315 --> 01:14:47,901
But they're gonna cutoff
the power, $0...

587
01:15:21,559 --> 01:15:24,896
<i>Stella. I got out.</i>

588
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:28,191
It's good to hear your voice.

589
01:15:28,358 --> 01:15:30,068
<i>Don't wait for me.</i>

590
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:33,780
Please.

591
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:38,576
Eben.

592
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:44,666
Run for Rogers Avenue,
towards the trencher.

593
01:15:49,587 --> 01:15:51,422
It's my turn.

594
01:16:51,232 --> 01:16:52,317
Fuck off!

595
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:42,784
Welcome to Barrow,
top of the world.

596
01:18:34,419 --> 01:18:36,713
You ain't gonna eat me.

597
01:19:57,794 --> 01:19:59,086
Beau....

598
01:20:01,005 --> 01:20:02,840
And Doug.

599
01:20:31,536 --> 01:20:33,746
Now there's six of us.

600
01:20:36,207 --> 01:20:38,334
Soon there'll be just five.

601
01:20:46,384 --> 01:20:49,637
The little girl in the store.

602
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:52,598
I changed.

603
01:20:53,975 --> 01:20:55,601
I'm just so thirsty now.

604
01:21:01,649 --> 01:21:03,860
I couldn't tell you.

605
01:21:04,402 --> 01:21:08,656
That photo's all I've got left
of my family.

606
01:21:12,285 --> 01:21:15,580
Martha was taking the kids
to visit her mom.

607
01:21:17,665 --> 01:21:19,542
They were hit...

608
01:21:21,085 --> 01:21:23,254
...by a drunk driver.

609
01:21:27,925 --> 01:21:31,637
I wanted to be with them so much.

610
01:21:35,933 --> 01:21:39,395
I couldn't bring myself to do it.

611
01:21:43,232 --> 01:21:46,569
But I know they're waiting for me.

612
01:21:50,615 --> 01:21:54,660
I can't live forever.

613
01:21:55,369 --> 01:21:57,246
I can't.

614
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:00,708
Eben.

615
01:22:03,669 --> 01:22:05,504
Don't let me.

616
01:22:08,841 --> 01:22:10,676
No, Carter.

617
01:22:11,552 --> 01:22:13,679
He told us what he wants.

618
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:39,932
Did you see that?

619
01:23:40,433 --> 01:23:41,934
Yeah.

620
01:23:49,734 --> 01:23:51,277
It's Billy.

621
01:24:18,429 --> 01:24:19,930
Billy.

622
01:24:50,294 --> 01:24:52,213
It's Peggy and the girls.

623
01:24:54,799 --> 01:24:57,259
I heard the screams.

624
01:24:58,844 --> 01:25:01,639
I didn't want them to die
like the rest.

625
01:25:03,849 --> 01:25:06,435
I tried to shoot myself too.

626
01:25:06,602 --> 01:25:09,146
The fucking gun jammed.

627
01:25:15,152 --> 01:25:17,029
I shouldn't have signaled to you.

628
01:25:18,864 --> 01:25:21,117
I just couldn't stand
being on my own.

629
01:25:40,845 --> 01:25:42,596
You have a family.

630
01:25:45,057 --> 01:25:47,393
You don't ever hurt them!

631
01:25:48,686 --> 01:25:51,856
Don't ever hurt them.

632
01:26:10,875 --> 01:26:13,169
Maybe they tried for the Utilidor.

633
01:27:01,926 --> 01:27:03,260
Gail.

634
01:27:04,511 --> 01:27:05,930
Gail.

635
01:27:09,725 --> 01:27:10,976
No. Stella.

636
01:27:16,565 --> 01:27:17,942
Stella.

637
01:27:25,616 --> 01:27:27,284
I'll meet you at the Utilidor.

638
01:27:34,959 --> 01:27:37,086
No, Billy, stay there!

639
01:29:15,059 --> 01:29:16,435
Eben!

640
01:29:17,561 --> 01:29:18,896
Jake.

641
01:29:21,398 --> 01:29:22,733
Jake.

642
01:29:29,782 --> 01:29:31,033
Stella?

643
01:29:32,701 --> 01:29:34,620
Gail Robbins?

644
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:36,497
We don't know.

645
01:31:18,098 --> 01:31:20,601
Stella, this is Eben. Come in.

646
01:31:22,311 --> 01:31:24,021
Where are you?

647
01:31:29,485 --> 01:31:31,236
Hello?

648
01:31:36,909 --> 01:31:40,120
- Hello?
-Stella. This is Eben.

649
01:31:40,287 --> 01:31:42,789
- Come in.
-Anyone?

650
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:09,691
Eben!

651
01:32:42,224 --> 01:32:44,476
Billy. Bill, hey. Billy!

652
01:32:46,144 --> 01:32:48,272
- Go!
-No. Billy.

653
01:32:48,772 --> 01:32:49,898
Shit. Shit.

654
01:32:57,281 --> 01:32:58,282
Eben!

655
01:33:52,085 --> 01:33:53,462
Hey.

656
01:33:54,838 --> 01:33:57,215
I found these behind Carter's desk.

657
01:33:57,382 --> 01:34:00,510
Chocolates, vitamins and vodka.

658
01:34:03,013 --> 01:34:04,598
Stella, come in. This is Eben.

659
01:34:06,099 --> 01:34:07,893
We should celebrate.

660
01:34:09,728 --> 01:34:11,897
One day till sunrise.

661
01:34:22,824 --> 01:34:25,452
You did good
getting everybody here.

662
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:35,504
<i>Eben.</i>

663
01:34:38,924 --> 01:34:40,717
Stella.

664
01:34:41,051 --> 01:34:44,721
<i>Whisper. They're walking around.</i>

665
01:34:44,930 --> 01:34:48,934
<i>I just had to hear your voice.
I've got Gail with me.</i>

666
01:34:49,101 --> 01:34:50,560
Where are you?

667
01:34:50,727 --> 01:34:53,563
Opposite the Melanson's,
under a wreck.

668
01:35:04,741 --> 01:35:08,412
- Are you okay?
-it's so cold.

669
01:35:08,912 --> 01:35:10,580
We're freezing, Eben.

670
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:14,918
I can see the car.
The wreck on the right.

671
01:35:16,461 --> 01:35:18,338
We're coming to get you.

672
01:35:21,842 --> 01:35:23,969
There's way too many of them.

673
01:35:24,136 --> 01:35:26,722
They'd kill us before we got to her.

674
01:35:36,106 --> 01:35:38,650
We have to cut off
or they'll hear you.

675
01:35:40,068 --> 01:35:42,696
I'll call you back when it's safe.

676
01:35:46,116 --> 01:35:48,744
<i>The sun comes up tomorrow.</i>

677
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:52,497
<i>We're gonna watch it together.</i>

678
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:56,585
I'm so sorry, baby.

679
01:35:58,462 --> 01:36:01,131
<i>I should never have left you.</i>

680
01:36:05,135 --> 01:36:07,846
The street's filling up with oil.

681
01:36:14,936 --> 01:36:17,272
They broke into the pipeline.

682
01:36:47,010 --> 01:36:49,179
They're burning down the town.

683
01:37:05,278 --> 01:37:07,697
Nobody will know what happened.

684
01:37:09,366 --> 01:37:11,952
They'll just think it was
some horrible accident.

685
01:37:18,291 --> 01:37:21,711
Next time they'll take out
Point Hope, Wainwright.

686
01:37:27,217 --> 01:37:29,177
Wait. Wait.

687
01:37:29,678 --> 01:37:32,973
This building's strong.
Can't we just ride it out here?

688
01:37:43,817 --> 01:37:45,861
He'll kill her if she runs.

689
01:37:48,822 --> 01:37:50,365
She'll burn if she stays.

690
01:37:55,579 --> 01:37:58,373
You go out there,
won't they come after all of us?

691
01:38:11,928 --> 01:38:13,221
Oh, dear God.

692
01:38:13,763 --> 01:38:15,432
Eben.

693
01:38:21,897 --> 01:38:23,440
Eben!

694
01:38:28,153 --> 01:38:29,529
Eben.

695
01:38:31,031 --> 01:38:32,657
Jake...

696
01:38:32,824 --> 01:38:36,119
...when they're all watching me,
get on the walkie-talkie...

697
01:38:38,163 --> 01:38:42,542
...and tell Stella to run for it.
-What are you talking about?

698
01:38:48,006 --> 01:38:49,633
Eben.

699
01:38:50,592 --> 01:38:55,138
When John Riis and Carter changed,
they were only bitten.

700
01:38:55,305 --> 01:38:57,807
They stayed who they were
for a little while.

701
01:39:00,810 --> 01:39:03,229
We can't fight them
the way that we are.

702
01:39:07,943 --> 01:39:09,986
Thanks, little brother.

703
01:39:12,447 --> 01:39:14,449
Take care of Stella for me.

704
01:39:20,789 --> 01:39:23,959
- Are you fucking crazy?
-it's somebody else's blood.

705
01:39:45,897 --> 01:39:50,610
- He's one of them.
-How do we know he won't attack us?

706
01:39:51,152 --> 01:39:54,280
- Maybe we should stop him now.
-Shut up.

707
01:39:54,447 --> 01:39:55,824
Shut up!

708
01:39:58,410 --> 01:40:00,412
Nobody touches him.

709
01:40:06,251 --> 01:40:08,044
I can smell your blood.

710
01:40:28,648 --> 01:40:31,234
You can't fight them all, Eben.

711
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:17,781
Stella, it's Jake.

712
01:41:18,907 --> 01:41:20,950
Get out of there now. Run.

713
01:42:23,555 --> 01:42:25,098
Go!

714
01:44:29,806 --> 01:44:32,308
What did you do to yourself?

715
01:44:33,559 --> 01:44:35,645
What I had to.

716
01:44:39,315 --> 01:44:40,775
Should I go after them?

717
01:44:47,365 --> 01:44:51,995
-It's almost dawn. We made it.
-Eben.

718
01:44:52,495 --> 01:44:54,289
The dawn.

718
01:44:55,305 --> 01:45:01,563
