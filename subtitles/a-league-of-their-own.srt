Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

2
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,568
You might need that.

3
00:01:03,235 --> 00:01:04,236
Where'd you find this?

4
00:01:04,803 --> 00:01:07,739
It was in one of those cartons.

5
00:01:11,509 --> 00:01:12,310
Needs oil.

6
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,711
Who doesn't?

7
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:16,714
You ready?

8
00:01:18,582 --> 00:01:19,950
- I'm not going.
- Mom!

9
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:22,820
I've got two children,
I don't need a third.

10
00:01:23,554 --> 00:01:25,255
Why is it so important that I go?

11
00:01:25,989 --> 00:01:28,591
For one thing, it'd be nice if you
just left the room.

12
00:01:29,526 --> 00:01:31,494
Besides, these are your old friends.

13
00:01:34,063 --> 00:01:35,564
They probably won't remember me.

14
00:01:36,932 --> 00:01:38,701
The "Queen of Diamonds," Dottie Hinson?

15
00:01:39,435 --> 00:01:41,270
Margaret, it just isn't a good idea.

16
00:01:42,004 --> 00:01:44,873
Come on, Mom.
You'll get to see Aunt Kit.

17
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,942
- You never see each other.
- We still won't.

18
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,978
She'll be traveling around
with that husband of hers.

19
00:01:51,846 --> 00:01:53,481
Frank. He has a name.

20
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:55,816
He's always been very nice to you.

21
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:58,318
He makes me nervous.

22
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:01,788
There's a lot of reasons
why I can't go.

23
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:03,990
Honey...

24
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:08,027
...I'm not comfortable about this.
I'm not really part of it.

25
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,964
It was never that important.
It was just something I did.

26
00:02:12,898 --> 00:02:16,402
When will you realize how special it
was, how much it all meant?

27
00:02:19,971 --> 00:02:22,374
I know how you feel. I really do.

28
00:02:24,075 --> 00:02:25,343
But you're going.

29
00:02:30,214 --> 00:02:31,315
Car.

30
00:02:33,851 --> 00:02:36,320
- Car, train, bus. I'm tired already.
- Sleep on the plane.

31
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,688
Grandma's out.
Is there a fire?

32
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:40,123
Wisenheimer.

33
00:02:40,523 --> 00:02:42,992
Julie's watching you.
I don't want any bad reports.

34
00:02:44,794 --> 00:02:45,728
- Bye, Grandma.
- Bye.

35
00:02:46,696 --> 00:02:48,197
Jeffrey, come here.

36
00:02:51,967 --> 00:02:54,636
No matter what your brother does,
he's littler than you.

37
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,672
Give him a chance to shoot. Promise?

38
00:03:00,075 --> 00:03:01,576
Bobby, come here.

39
00:03:03,711 --> 00:03:04,712
Kill him.

40
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,548
Come on, you'll miss your plane.

41
00:03:33,405 --> 00:03:35,307
I still think I shouldn't go.

42
00:04:49,941 --> 00:04:51,009
Get a hit, Beans!

43
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:04,521
I'm coming, Mae! I'm coming!

44
00:05:14,864 --> 00:05:17,266
This week in the world of sports.

45
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:20,769
With the boys overseas
and off to war...

46
00:05:21,536 --> 00:05:23,672
...baseball pitches in
for the war effort.

47
00:05:24,806 --> 00:05:26,641
Trading bats for bullets,
Yankee Joe DiMaggio...

48
00:05:27,342 --> 00:05:29,177
...promises to give
those Nazis a jolt.

49
00:05:30,344 --> 00:05:32,313
Ace fireballer Bob Feller...

50
00:05:33,047 --> 00:05:35,382
...has traded Cleveland gray
for Navy blue.

51
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,118
Baseball's biggest stars say...

52
00:05:38,852 --> 00:05:41,154
..."Look out, Mr. Hitler.
The Yanks are coming. "

53
00:05:41,955 --> 00:05:44,357
Not to mention the Indians,
Red Sox and Tigers.

54
00:05:45,225 --> 00:05:47,760
And they won't come back
till it's over, over there.

55
00:05:50,496 --> 00:05:54,133
Meanwhile, Chicago club owner
Walter Harvey, the candy-bar king...

56
00:05:55,334 --> 00:05:58,703
...met with other team owners at
the Harvey Mansion as rumours persist...

57
00:05:59,838 --> 00:06:03,141
...that baseball may be shut down
for the duration of the war.

58
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:07,011
Harvey's promotional whiz kid,
Ira Lowenstein...

59
00:06:08,012 --> 00:06:11,382
...has been given the job of
figuring out how to keep baseball going.

60
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:14,551
Good luck, Mr. Lowenstein.

61
00:06:23,893 --> 00:06:25,261
Strike 2!

62
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:36,905
Hey, fatso!

63
00:06:37,405 --> 00:06:39,874
Get the hell out of the way!
What are you, crazy?

64
00:06:41,843 --> 00:06:43,211
Strike 3!

65
00:06:48,048 --> 00:06:49,049
Kit!

66
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,919
- Sis, don't swing at her high pitch.
- I can hit it.

67
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,655
- You can't.
- I can.

68
00:06:56,356 --> 00:06:58,391
This bat's too heavy.
You'll never get it around.

69
00:06:59,158 --> 00:07:00,259
I will!

70
00:07:01,394 --> 00:07:04,330
Listen. There's a big hole
on the right side. Don't look.

71
00:07:05,264 --> 00:07:07,299
- Unless she pitches inside, pull it.
- I know.

72
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,001
Batter up!

73
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,103
No high ones.

74
00:07:12,671 --> 00:07:13,872
I like the high ones!

75
00:07:14,372 --> 00:07:16,074
- Mule!
- Nag!

76
00:07:24,581 --> 00:07:27,184
Come on, Kit.
Keep your eye on the ball.

77
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:34,057
Strike 1!

78
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:46,134
Strike 2!

79
00:07:47,636 --> 00:07:48,503
Too high.

80
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:56,978
All right, Kit. Look it over!

81
00:07:57,578 --> 00:07:59,146
Look it over there!

82
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:01,482
Strike 3!

83
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:10,523
All right, 2 outs, everybody.
Two away!

84
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:13,025
Better luck next time!

85
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:15,828
Knock it out of here! Okay, Dottie!

86
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,131
Batter up!

87
00:08:27,272 --> 00:08:28,439
Right in here!

88
00:08:33,077 --> 00:08:34,578
Bring them in there, Dottie!

89
00:08:37,715 --> 00:08:38,582
Ball!

90
00:08:45,488 --> 00:08:47,390
Keep your eye on it, Dottie!

91
00:08:48,224 --> 00:08:50,393
One hit and we win!

92
00:09:01,169 --> 00:09:03,071
That's it, Dottie! You did it!

93
00:09:06,074 --> 00:09:07,375
That's the ball game!

94
00:09:18,985 --> 00:09:21,354
Hey, Kit! What are you swinging
those high ones for?

95
00:09:22,155 --> 00:09:24,290
Good thing your sister bailed you out.

96
00:09:25,925 --> 00:09:28,094
How about the two bucks you owe me
for this game?

97
00:09:28,828 --> 00:09:31,096
Kit! Wait up, I'll give you a ride!

98
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:35,434
Stop kicking the rocks.

99
00:09:35,934 --> 00:09:36,868
I'm sorry.

100
00:09:37,636 --> 00:09:40,705
- That game just made me so mad.
- We won. Get mad if we lose.

101
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,674
That last pitch was
right down the middle.

102
00:09:44,609 --> 00:09:46,644
If I'd have swung at that,
I'd be the hero.

103
00:09:47,445 --> 00:09:50,047
- You got me so crazy-
- I only said lay off the high ones.

104
00:09:50,948 --> 00:09:52,983
"Good thing your sister bailed you out. "

105
00:09:54,851 --> 00:09:57,520
"Kit, why don't you get your sister
to teach you how to hit?"

106
00:09:58,455 --> 00:10:00,423
"Why can't you be beautiful
like your sister?"

107
00:10:01,157 --> 00:10:02,592
What idiot said that?

108
00:10:03,192 --> 00:10:04,193
No one.

109
00:10:04,694 --> 00:10:07,162
- But that's what they were thinking.
- No, it's not!

110
00:10:09,765 --> 00:10:11,667
You ever hear Dad
introduce us to people?

111
00:10:13,101 --> 00:10:14,803
"This is our daughter Dottie.

112
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:18,339
This is our other daughter,
Dottie's sister.

113
00:10:19,941 --> 00:10:22,076
Should've just had you
and bought a dog.

114
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,946
- Mitch Swaley likes you.
- He's one step up from dating pigs.

115
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,382
But an important step.

116
00:10:32,052 --> 00:10:33,820
- Why are you walking so fast?
- Why are you?

117
00:10:34,521 --> 00:10:37,457
- Because you are.
- Can't even let me walk faster than you?

118
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,801
Girls, you got chores to do.

119
00:10:54,505 --> 00:10:56,841
Don't run! You'll scare the chickens!

120
00:10:58,509 --> 00:11:00,477
I don't have time for these games.

121
00:11:01,845 --> 00:11:03,814
- Why are you running?
- You can go faster than that.

122
00:11:04,514 --> 00:11:05,682
Your legs are longer.

123
00:11:06,216 --> 00:11:07,584
- I win!
- Barely.

124
00:11:30,371 --> 00:11:31,039
Hey!

125
00:11:32,974 --> 00:11:33,975
Hey, yourself.

126
00:11:36,377 --> 00:11:37,244
Doesn't that hurt them?

127
00:11:39,146 --> 00:11:40,013
Doesn't seem to.

128
00:11:40,881 --> 00:11:42,983
It would bruise the hell out of me.

129
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,751
Who are you?

130
00:11:45,218 --> 00:11:46,920
I'm Ernie Capadino, baseball scout.

131
00:11:47,687 --> 00:11:50,556
I saw you playing today.
Not bad, not bad.

132
00:11:51,524 --> 00:11:53,292
Ever hear of Walter Harvey?
Harvey Bars?

133
00:11:53,993 --> 00:11:55,160
You know, the candy?

134
00:11:55,661 --> 00:11:57,996
Yeah, we feed them to the cows
when they're constipated.

135
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:01,099
He's starting
a girls' baseball league...

136
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,169
...so we can make a buck
while the boys are overseas.

137
00:12:05,003 --> 00:12:05,937
Wanna play?

138
00:12:06,871 --> 00:12:10,871
Nice retort. Tryouts are in Chicago.
It's a real league, professional.

139
00:12:12,109 --> 00:12:13,677
Professional baseball?

140
00:12:15,245 --> 00:12:17,147
They'll pay you $75 a week.

141
00:12:18,615 --> 00:12:19,916
We only make $30 at the dairy.

142
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,852
Then this would be more,
wouldn't it? Interested?

143
00:12:24,254 --> 00:12:26,355
Come on. $75 a week?

144
00:12:27,757 --> 00:12:29,525
Pull her leg. Mine are long enough.

145
00:12:30,192 --> 00:12:32,027
Look, your country needs you.

146
00:12:32,695 --> 00:12:35,297
You can not only play ball,
but you're kind of a dolly.

147
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:38,466
Oh, now I get it.
Listen, mister.

148
00:12:39,501 --> 00:12:41,469
I'm a married woman.
My husband's overseas.

149
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:44,972
Oh, relax!
I'm talking lookie, no touchie.

150
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,174
We want girls easy on the eye.

151
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:50,044
I'll go. I'm ready now.
I gotta sign something?

152
00:12:50,844 --> 00:12:53,714
I don't want you! I want her!
The one who hit the ball!

153
00:12:54,614 --> 00:12:56,316
You can climb back under the cow.

154
00:12:57,217 --> 00:12:58,585
She's good. She's very good.

155
00:12:59,119 --> 00:13:01,521
She pitches. She didn't today,
because she did yesterday.

156
00:13:02,388 --> 00:13:04,423
Thanks for that special glimpse
into her life.

157
00:13:05,257 --> 00:13:06,058
I want you.

158
00:13:06,792 --> 00:13:08,227
You I saw, you I like.

159
00:13:08,861 --> 00:13:10,295
The train leaves for Chicago tomorrow.

160
00:13:11,763 --> 00:13:13,198
What do you say?
Are you in?

161
00:13:13,765 --> 00:13:14,432
No, thanks.

162
00:13:16,601 --> 00:13:17,735
"No, thanks"?

163
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,937
Hey, no skin off my Ashtabula.

164
00:13:20,538 --> 00:13:22,707
If you wanna pluck cows,
that's your business.

165
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:25,009
You know something? You're not nice.

166
00:13:26,543 --> 00:13:28,745
That one hurt. So long, milkmaids.

167
00:13:35,452 --> 00:13:36,452
No, wait!

168
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,356
Just watch me pitch. Dottie,
get your mitt! I'll throw him a few.

169
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:44,760
Now look...

170
00:13:45,294 --> 00:13:48,163
...I know the goods when I see
the goods, and she's the goods.

171
00:13:49,765 --> 00:13:50,866
I'm sorry.

172
00:13:57,672 --> 00:13:59,373
Will you shut up?!

173
00:14:01,242 --> 00:14:02,476
You're a pitcher, huh?

174
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:09,950
I'll tell you what.
If she comes, you can come too.

175
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:13,186
If you stink, it only costs us
the train ticket.

176
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,555
Get these wild animals away from me!

177
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,857
Haven't you ever heard of a leash?

178
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:23,162
Come on, Dottie.

179
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,298
You got the whole rest of your life
to hang around here.

180
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:29,334
Never go anywhere. Never do anything.

181
00:14:30,568 --> 00:14:33,438
I'm married. I'm happy.
It's what I want. Don't confuse things.

182
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:41,178
But can't you just have this first?

183
00:14:41,912 --> 00:14:45,482
Just so you can say you once
did something? Something special?

184
00:14:49,085 --> 00:14:50,086
Goodness sake, Kit!

185
00:14:50,753 --> 00:14:53,689
Keep your voice down.
Your father's listening to the radio.

186
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,092
Please, Dottie?

187
00:14:58,927 --> 00:15:00,429
I gotta get out of here.

188
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:03,365
I'm nothing here.

189
00:15:14,008 --> 00:15:15,909
In the Pacific Northwest,
my territory...

190
00:15:16,677 --> 00:15:20,313
...we have increased sales 106%
in the last 12-month period.

191
00:15:21,481 --> 00:15:22,983
And this with a war on!

192
00:15:26,953 --> 00:15:30,022
You know, if I had your job,
I'd kill myself.

193
00:15:31,957 --> 00:15:34,360
Sit here. I'll see if I can
dig up a pistol.

194
00:15:36,528 --> 00:15:39,131
Every trip I take, I gotta sit
next to one of these guys.

195
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,333
I'm just too friendly.

196
00:15:41,933 --> 00:15:42,867
Hey, isn't that-?

197
00:15:46,971 --> 00:15:49,707
Well, I'll say one thing for them.
They can run.

198
00:15:50,975 --> 00:15:52,209
Mr. Capadino!

199
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:53,811
I got her! Look!

200
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,247
- Sir, your knee.
- Like it?

201
00:15:58,148 --> 00:15:59,516
Stop the train!

202
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,655
Come on! Come on!

203
00:16:10,726 --> 00:16:11,827
Give me that bag!

204
00:16:25,006 --> 00:16:26,974
Did you promise the cows you'd write?

205
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:37,784
When do we get to Chicago?

206
00:16:39,252 --> 00:16:41,721
We gotta make a stop.
Fort Collins, Colorado.

207
00:16:43,022 --> 00:16:44,590
Gotta look at another girl.

208
00:16:45,691 --> 00:16:47,126
Hope you're not jealous.

209
00:16:53,932 --> 00:16:54,599
I'm sorry.

210
00:16:54,999 --> 00:16:56,768
It's okay, honey. That was good form.

211
00:17:00,171 --> 00:17:01,172
Thattagirl!

212
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,340
Good, honey. Good.

213
00:17:06,577 --> 00:17:07,311
Nice, nice.

214
00:17:07,711 --> 00:17:08,812
That's a rope, honey.

215
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,815
Good girl. Good, good.

216
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:14,350
Right, too high.

217
00:17:14,984 --> 00:17:16,686
She's got an eye like DiMaggio.

218
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,093
Okay, Marla.

219
00:17:25,594 --> 00:17:26,461
Now lefty.

220
00:17:41,241 --> 00:17:42,042
She's really good.

221
00:17:43,443 --> 00:17:44,244
She's your daughter?

222
00:17:48,214 --> 00:17:49,916
Her mom's dead.
It's just the two of us.

223
00:17:51,351 --> 00:17:53,886
Coach said if she was a boy,
she'd go to the state tournament.

224
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,023
I said, "If she was a boy, I'd talk to
the Yankees instead of living here."

225
00:18:02,394 --> 00:18:04,096
That's enough.
You can bring her over.

226
00:18:04,763 --> 00:18:05,630
Okay, Marla.

227
00:18:06,231 --> 00:18:06,898
Come here.

228
00:18:07,298 --> 00:18:08,099
Boys!

229
00:18:08,533 --> 00:18:09,634
Hit the showers!

230
00:18:18,642 --> 00:18:20,010
Take off your hat, honey.

231
00:18:32,755 --> 00:18:33,989
We'll let you know.

232
00:18:35,758 --> 00:18:37,526
Daddy, I'm sorry.

233
00:18:38,227 --> 00:18:39,795
Let's go. We'll miss the train.

234
00:18:40,462 --> 00:18:42,030
Let's move, move, move!

235
00:18:44,566 --> 00:18:45,733
What's the matter?

236
00:18:47,135 --> 00:18:48,436
I can't use her.

237
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:51,105
She's great. Why not?
What's the problem?

238
00:18:52,706 --> 00:18:54,541
You know General Omar Bradley?

239
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:57,411
There's too strong a resemblance.

240
00:18:58,945 --> 00:19:00,981
You ain't taking her
because she ain't pretty?

241
00:19:01,748 --> 00:19:03,583
Well, look who just caught up!

242
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,685
All right. Come on, let's go.

243
00:19:07,887 --> 00:19:09,588
Pick those suitcases up! Come on!

244
00:19:10,322 --> 00:19:11,690
I'm not kidding. Move!

245
00:19:12,257 --> 00:19:13,826
- One foot in front of the other.
- Mister?

246
00:19:20,165 --> 00:19:22,834
I know my girl ain't so pretty
as these girls.

247
00:19:23,935 --> 00:19:25,303
But that's my fault.

248
00:19:26,103 --> 00:19:27,938
I raised her like I would a boy.

249
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,807
I didn't know any better.

250
00:19:31,975 --> 00:19:33,744
She loves to play.

251
00:19:35,946 --> 00:19:38,548
Don't make my girl suffer
because I messed up raising her.

252
00:19:40,483 --> 00:19:41,417
Please?

253
00:19:45,521 --> 00:19:47,223
I wish you had a decent mitt.

254
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,325
I think maybe I'd better not go.

255
00:19:51,026 --> 00:19:52,594
No, you can relace it.

256
00:19:53,195 --> 00:19:54,062
It'll be okay.

257
00:19:54,663 --> 00:19:56,831
I mean, who's gonna
take care of you? Cook?

258
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:59,167
Help you take care of the equipment?

259
00:19:59,801 --> 00:20:01,235
Don't you worry about me.

260
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:03,904
You'll play baseball.

261
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,641
I'm not gonna know anybody.

262
00:20:11,178 --> 00:20:13,079
Nothing's ever gonna happen here.

263
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:17,984
You gotta go where things happen.

264
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,054
I love you, Daddy.

265
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:30,562
Let's go, let's go.

266
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,931
Come on, honey.

267
00:20:43,307 --> 00:20:44,241
Are you coming?

268
00:20:47,044 --> 00:20:49,779
See, how it works is, the train moves,
not the station.

269
00:20:54,784 --> 00:20:56,552
This is making me sick.

270
00:21:04,226 --> 00:21:05,527
Write to me, honey.

271
00:21:06,962 --> 00:21:08,163
I love you.

272
00:21:37,356 --> 00:21:39,124
Hey, cowgirls, see the grass?

273
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:40,959
Don't eat it.

274
00:21:54,405 --> 00:21:56,707
Okay, girls, this is it.
Harvey Field.

275
00:21:57,508 --> 00:21:58,675
Tryouts. Get out there.

276
00:21:59,176 --> 00:22:01,144
Show them what you got.
Don't embarrass me.

277
00:22:01,912 --> 00:22:04,114
It's been a thin slice of heaven.
Goodbye.

278
00:22:05,248 --> 00:22:06,616
Wait. You're going?

279
00:22:07,817 --> 00:22:09,085
Dry your eyes.

280
00:22:09,585 --> 00:22:11,554
I'm going home.
Grab a shower and a shave.

281
00:22:12,321 --> 00:22:15,390
Give the wife a pickle-tickle,
and I'm on my way. I'll see you.

282
00:22:17,726 --> 00:22:18,593
- But-
- But what?

283
00:22:19,327 --> 00:22:20,428
Field! Tryouts! Play!

284
00:22:21,196 --> 00:22:22,764
That's it! Get lost!

285
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:27,935
I hate when they get
attached to me like that.

286
00:22:38,612 --> 00:22:39,546
- Hey, Mae.
- What?

287
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,115
- Come look at this.
- Wait a second, Doris.

288
00:22:42,882 --> 00:22:44,917
I can't wait much longer, so get up.

289
00:22:47,086 --> 00:22:47,953
Yeah, so?

290
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,589
Yeah, so I ain't done yet.
Watch this.

291
00:22:52,724 --> 00:22:54,226
- That's it?
- You can't do it, Mae.

292
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:57,595
I could do it. How long you been
working on that, Doris?

293
00:22:58,530 --> 00:22:59,397
Took me a year.

294
00:22:59,898 --> 00:23:03,334
Not counting the two months I was in the
hospital. Bat hit me right in the head.

295
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:07,304
Your head and not your behind?
That looks really swollen.

296
00:23:08,172 --> 00:23:11,675
- What kind of thing is that to say?
- I'm joking, okay? I'm nervous.

297
00:23:15,011 --> 00:23:16,579
- What are you looking at?
- Yeah, what?

298
00:23:17,614 --> 00:23:18,715
Nothing.

299
00:23:19,615 --> 00:23:20,917
That's right, nothing.

300
00:23:21,784 --> 00:23:23,686
All these girls gonna be in the league?

301
00:23:25,354 --> 00:23:26,288
- You wish.
- You do wish.

302
00:23:26,722 --> 00:23:29,258
- Four teams. Sixteen girls to a team.
- That's right.

303
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:31,860
Sixty-four girls.

304
00:23:32,394 --> 00:23:33,662
What are you, a genius?

305
00:23:34,195 --> 00:23:37,332
They got over 100 girls here,
so some of youse will have to go home.

306
00:23:38,366 --> 00:23:40,067
- Sorry about that.
- Come on, Doris.

307
00:23:40,735 --> 00:23:42,303
What do you mean, "some of us"?

308
00:23:47,641 --> 00:23:49,976
- Okay, some of them are going home.
- How'd you do that?

309
00:23:51,411 --> 00:23:52,645
Excuse me.

310
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,914
You caught that. Hello?

311
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,417
Let's go practice.

312
00:23:58,918 --> 00:24:00,953
She caught it with her bare hand.

313
00:24:04,223 --> 00:24:06,558
And now, from Chicago,
The Mutual presents...

314
00:24:07,392 --> 00:24:10,128
...another social commentary
by Miss Maida Gilespie.

315
00:24:11,396 --> 00:24:12,897
Careers and higher education...

316
00:24:13,498 --> 00:24:15,900
...are leading to
the masculinization of women...

317
00:24:16,801 --> 00:24:18,969
...with enormously dangerous
consequences...

318
00:24:19,737 --> 00:24:22,272
...to the home, the children
and our country.

319
00:24:23,373 --> 00:24:25,075
When our boys come home from war...

320
00:24:25,709 --> 00:24:28,044
...what kind of girls will they
be coming home to?

321
00:24:28,812 --> 00:24:31,948
And now, the most
disgusting example...

322
00:24:32,982 --> 00:24:36,052
...of this sexual confusion,
Mr. Walter Harvey, of Harvey Bars...

323
00:24:37,086 --> 00:24:40,222
...is presenting us
with women's baseball.

324
00:24:41,256 --> 00:24:44,392
Right here in Chicago, young girls
plucked from their families...

325
00:24:45,794 --> 00:24:47,095
...are gathered at Harvey Field...

326
00:24:47,662 --> 00:24:50,331
...to see which one of them
can be the most masculine.

327
00:24:51,232 --> 00:24:55,002
Mr. Harvey, like your candy bars,
you are completely nuts.

328
00:25:23,495 --> 00:25:25,330
Very good. Try another.

329
00:25:51,287 --> 00:25:52,454
Nice throw!

330
00:26:16,676 --> 00:26:19,345
Your name will be on
one of those five lists.

331
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,381
Okay, find your name.

332
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:28,020
If we could just form
two or three parallel lines...

333
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:37,962
I'm a Peach!

334
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:42,166
A Rockford Peach!

335
00:26:42,733 --> 00:26:44,435
I made it! I can stay!

336
00:26:46,236 --> 00:26:49,539
Are you a newspaper guy? This is
my friend Mae. She made the team.

337
00:26:52,342 --> 00:26:55,078
Come on, we got a lot to do.
Let's settle down.

338
00:26:55,979 --> 00:26:57,347
Now, you're the first-

339
00:27:01,183 --> 00:27:04,186
Honey, are you supposed to be here,
or are you on the cut list?

340
00:27:06,822 --> 00:27:08,323
Look, I'm sorry.

341
00:27:09,191 --> 00:27:11,793
If you're on the cut list,
you have to leave the field.

342
00:27:12,694 --> 00:27:13,995
Well, are you cut?

343
00:27:15,196 --> 00:27:18,833
Look on the list. It's either Rockford,
Racine, Kenosha or South Bend.

344
00:27:23,737 --> 00:27:25,372
Can you read, honey?

345
00:27:26,373 --> 00:27:27,240
No.

346
00:27:27,674 --> 00:27:29,442
All right, what's your name?

347
00:27:30,643 --> 00:27:31,945
Shirley Baker.

348
00:27:33,379 --> 00:27:34,814
Let's just take a look.

349
00:27:43,855 --> 00:27:44,790
This is you.

350
00:27:45,257 --> 00:27:47,292
You're with us.
You're a Rockford Peach.

351
00:27:49,894 --> 00:27:50,828
Go join your team.

352
00:27:52,864 --> 00:27:54,765
Settle down.
We got a lot to go over.

353
00:27:55,499 --> 00:27:57,268
First, congratulations.

354
00:27:58,168 --> 00:27:59,870
You are the first members...

355
00:28:00,504 --> 00:28:03,106
...of the All-American
Girls' Baseball League.

356
00:28:08,044 --> 00:28:09,345
I'm Charlie Collins.

357
00:28:09,946 --> 00:28:12,815
I'll be managing the Racine team
when the season starts.

358
00:28:13,883 --> 00:28:15,985
The other teams will have
managers soon.

359
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:18,620
At the end of practice today...

360
00:28:19,288 --> 00:28:21,690
...you all have to get fitted
for your uniforms.

361
00:28:22,557 --> 00:28:25,894
And this is what they'll look like.
Pretty darn nifty, if you ask me.

362
00:28:27,862 --> 00:28:29,430
You can't slide in that.

363
00:28:30,064 --> 00:28:31,065
That's a dress.

364
00:28:31,565 --> 00:28:32,733
It's half a dress.

365
00:28:33,267 --> 00:28:34,435
That's not a baseball uniform.

366
00:28:34,935 --> 00:28:37,471
What do you think we are,
ballplayers or ballerinas?

367
00:28:38,705 --> 00:28:39,806
It's awfully short.

368
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,209
Short? I'm gonna have to squat
in that thing.

369
00:28:45,245 --> 00:28:46,879
I can't!
My husband will kill me.

370
00:28:47,513 --> 00:28:48,181
Ladies!

371
00:28:51,417 --> 00:28:52,084
Excuse me.

372
00:28:52,451 --> 00:28:54,920
You can't play ball in this,
you can't play ball with us.

373
00:28:57,456 --> 00:28:59,424
There are 38 girls getting
tickets home...

374
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:02,227
...who'll play in a bathing suit
if I ask.

375
00:29:02,961 --> 00:29:04,996
There's no pockets for my cigarettes.

376
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,865
There is no smoking.

377
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:10,367
There is also no drinking and no men.

378
00:29:11,568 --> 00:29:14,871
Your social engagements will be cleared
through your team chaperones.

379
00:29:15,906 --> 00:29:18,308
You'll have regular classes
at charm and beauty school.

380
00:29:19,476 --> 00:29:20,410
For what?

381
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,679
Every girl in this league
will be a lady.

382
00:29:25,548 --> 00:29:27,950
And gracefully and grandly.

383
00:29:29,084 --> 00:29:31,420
Gracefully and grandly.

384
00:29:42,096 --> 00:29:43,331
All right, now go back!

385
00:29:44,131 --> 00:29:45,566
And sip.

386
00:29:46,467 --> 00:29:47,334
Down.

387
00:29:47,835 --> 00:29:48,836
Don't slurp.

388
00:29:49,336 --> 00:29:50,437
Sip.

389
00:29:51,438 --> 00:29:52,372
Down.

390
00:29:52,806 --> 00:29:53,807
Don't slurp.

391
00:30:01,914 --> 00:30:03,182
Stop that!

392
00:30:03,682 --> 00:30:04,483
It's good.

393
00:30:05,618 --> 00:30:06,852
Posture!

394
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,354
Heads up.

395
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:11,723
Backs straight.

396
00:30:12,257 --> 00:30:13,825
And sit.

397
00:30:17,495 --> 00:30:19,897
Right over left.
Legs always together.

398
00:30:20,731 --> 00:30:21,832
A lady reveals nothing.

399
00:30:27,904 --> 00:30:30,006
The hair. Soften and shorten.

400
00:30:31,641 --> 00:30:34,310
The eyebrows. Thin and separate.
There should be two.

401
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,448
ery nice.

402
00:30:40,349 --> 00:30:41,584
ery nice!

403
00:30:43,152 --> 00:30:44,253
Lovely!

404
00:30:47,489 --> 00:30:48,657
What do you suggest?

405
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:51,092
A lot of night games.

406
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:58,732
I wanna show you the grounds.
You know, I always-

407
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:01,235
Jimmy, come on.

408
00:31:01,835 --> 00:31:03,470
I'm showing you around.
Beautiful, huh?

409
00:31:04,137 --> 00:31:05,705
Place used to be a golf course.

410
00:31:06,339 --> 00:31:08,508
I never cared for the game,
but I love grass.

411
00:31:09,309 --> 00:31:12,178
It costs a fortune,
with the mowing and trimming.

412
00:31:13,145 --> 00:31:16,515
But I grew up in an apartment.
I had one lousy plant in a cheese box.

413
00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:19,318
Now look. I got a park.

414
00:31:21,687 --> 00:31:23,788
These are my in-laws. Hello!

415
00:31:24,723 --> 00:31:27,392
They can't hear nothing.
Enough socializing.

416
00:31:28,493 --> 00:31:30,962
Jimmy, I'm thinking of giving you
another managing job.

417
00:31:34,932 --> 00:31:37,734
Mr. Harvey, I guarantee I'll do
a better job than last time.

418
00:31:38,669 --> 00:31:41,271
You kind of let me down
on that San Antonio job.

419
00:31:42,172 --> 00:31:45,241
I had no right to sell off
the team's equipment like that.

420
00:31:46,276 --> 00:31:47,443
It won't happen again.

421
00:31:47,944 --> 00:31:50,613
Let me be blunt.
Are you still a fall-down drunk?

422
00:31:53,048 --> 00:31:54,350
Well, that is blunt.

423
00:31:56,718 --> 00:31:58,754
No, sir. I've quit drinking.

424
00:31:59,521 --> 00:32:00,956
You've seen the error of your ways?

425
00:32:01,623 --> 00:32:03,258
No, I just can't afford it.

426
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,260
That's funny to you?

427
00:32:07,161 --> 00:32:08,663
Your drinking is funny?

428
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:10,631
You're a young man.

429
00:32:11,732 --> 00:32:13,367
You still could be playing...

430
00:32:14,034 --> 00:32:16,837
...if you just would've laid off
the booze.

431
00:32:18,738 --> 00:32:21,474
Well, it's not exactly like that.

432
00:32:22,675 --> 00:32:23,409
I hurt my knee.

433
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:26,212
You fell out of a hotel.
That's how you hurt it!

434
00:32:27,046 --> 00:32:27,980
There was a fire.

435
00:32:28,414 --> 00:32:30,182
Which you started,
which I paid for.

436
00:32:30,883 --> 00:32:31,884
I was gonna send you...

437
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:35,454
...a thank-you card, but I wasn't
allowed anything sharp to write with.

438
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:39,657
I want you to manage
one of the new girls' baseball teams.

439
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:44,128
Don't look so stunned. Face it.

440
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:48,432
You're still a name. You step
out of the dugout before every game.

441
00:32:49,566 --> 00:32:50,801
You wave your little hat.

442
00:32:51,335 --> 00:32:52,502
You give the people a thrill.

443
00:32:53,003 --> 00:32:55,305
Get an organ grinder.
I can hop around and dance.

444
00:32:56,106 --> 00:32:57,740
If your knees are up to it,
go ahead.

445
00:32:59,776 --> 00:33:01,010
Mr. Harvey...

446
00:33:03,012 --> 00:33:04,914
...I hit 487 home runs
for your baseball club.

447
00:33:05,581 --> 00:33:07,549
Three in the World Series,
two in game 4 alone.

448
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,585
I know that.

449
00:33:10,085 --> 00:33:11,853
That's why I'm giving you this job.

450
00:33:12,587 --> 00:33:13,755
Take it or leave it.

451
00:33:14,823 --> 00:33:15,824
I gotta feed the fish.

452
00:33:21,095 --> 00:33:23,197
Ladies and gentlemen!
Welcome to the first game...

453
00:33:23,998 --> 00:33:26,033
...of the All-American
Girls' Baseball League!

454
00:33:26,767 --> 00:33:30,003
The South Bend Blue Sox
against your own Rockford Peaches.

455
00:33:31,104 --> 00:33:33,840
- Where is he?
- I can't believe he's our manager.

456
00:33:34,741 --> 00:33:38,077
I was listening to the radio when he hit
that home run to win the pennant.

457
00:33:39,578 --> 00:33:41,680
I'm asking him to sign
my husband's baseball card.

458
00:33:42,414 --> 00:33:44,450
Do you mind?
Could I take a look at that?

459
00:33:45,184 --> 00:33:46,551
Just be careful with it.

460
00:33:47,085 --> 00:33:50,288
If anything happens, he'll come back
from the Pacific and kill me.

461
00:34:02,066 --> 00:34:04,601
- Mr. Dugan-
- Mr. Dugan, I'm simply...

462
00:34:36,297 --> 00:34:37,598
Do something, Mae.

463
00:34:38,632 --> 00:34:39,366
Time him.

464
00:34:40,267 --> 00:34:41,635
Give me your watch.

465
00:34:43,436 --> 00:34:44,504
Could be a record.

466
00:34:50,977 --> 00:34:52,211
That counts.

467
00:34:52,945 --> 00:34:54,113
How long?

468
00:34:55,948 --> 00:34:57,249
I ain't gonna ask you again.

469
00:34:57,816 --> 00:34:59,651
Shut up, Doris.

470
00:35:04,889 --> 00:35:05,890
Keep timing.

471
00:35:12,796 --> 00:35:13,964
Hey, Mae, how long?

472
00:35:15,732 --> 00:35:17,567
Boy, that was some good peeing.

473
00:35:20,503 --> 00:35:21,438
Hey, coach.

474
00:35:21,938 --> 00:35:25,074
Mr. Dugan? Could you sign
my husband's baseball card for me?

475
00:35:29,078 --> 00:35:30,012
Great to meet you!

476
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,348
What'll we do?
He didn't give us a lineup.

477
00:35:34,082 --> 00:35:35,083
We can't play without one.

478
00:35:35,751 --> 00:35:37,519
I'll pitch. I can pitch.

479
00:35:41,756 --> 00:35:43,958
- I thought I was playing centre field.
- No, I am.

480
00:35:46,427 --> 00:35:48,662
Hey, you guys. Come on.

481
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,131
How hard can it be to make a lineup?

482
00:35:51,832 --> 00:35:53,867
Oh, yeah?
Why don't you do it, Oregon?

483
00:35:54,601 --> 00:35:56,303
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

484
00:35:57,971 --> 00:35:59,806
All right.
Mae, centre field, lead off.

485
00:36:00,506 --> 00:36:01,307
She's good.

486
00:36:01,808 --> 00:36:03,776
And now, the manager of the Peaches...

487
00:36:04,577 --> 00:36:07,179
...former six-time
National League Home Run Champ...

488
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,882
...Jimmy Dugan!

489
00:36:14,686 --> 00:36:17,222
Jimmy, look up here! We love you!

490
00:36:18,523 --> 00:36:21,659
Bullshit. You can all kiss my ass.
That's right.

491
00:36:22,927 --> 00:36:25,029
Kiss my big hairy ass.

492
00:36:27,331 --> 00:36:29,166
And the Rockford Peaches!

493
00:36:30,334 --> 00:36:32,502
Doris Murphy takes the field!

494
00:36:34,971 --> 00:36:36,406
Lift up your skirt!

495
00:36:38,274 --> 00:36:39,208
This'll be something.

496
00:36:39,976 --> 00:36:41,344
Ain't too many people here.

497
00:36:42,144 --> 00:36:43,512
- You nervous, Doris?
- Yeah.

498
00:36:44,046 --> 00:36:44,913
I ain't.

499
00:36:48,884 --> 00:36:51,553
- Are they laughing at us?
- Yeah, they're laughing at us.

500
00:36:55,657 --> 00:36:57,992
- They hate us.
- Just keep smiling.

501
00:37:00,461 --> 00:37:03,197
Hey, glamour puss!
Can you throw the ball?

502
00:37:04,131 --> 00:37:05,766
All right, ladies, let's play ball!

503
00:37:06,466 --> 00:37:08,435
- Let's play ball.
- Dirt in the skirt!

504
00:37:09,636 --> 00:37:11,805
And now, the lineup for Rockford:

505
00:37:12,972 --> 00:37:16,876
Leading off and playing centre
field, number 5, Mae Mordabito!

506
00:37:18,511 --> 00:37:21,814
Batting second and playing 3rd base,
number 22, Doris Murphy!

507
00:37:23,815 --> 00:37:26,885
Batting third, the catcher,
number 8, Dottie Hinson!

508
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:31,990
Batting fourth and playing 2nd base,
number 32, Marla Hooch.

509
00:37:33,057 --> 00:37:34,492
Girls can't play ball!

510
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:36,327
Batting fifth...

511
00:37:36,861 --> 00:37:38,829
Look at me! I'm a ballplayer!

512
00:37:48,538 --> 00:37:50,807
Better look out,
I might break a nail!

513
00:37:51,641 --> 00:37:54,043
- number 1, Ellen Sue Gotlander.

514
00:38:02,551 --> 00:38:04,252
- It slipped!
- Batting ninth, pitcher...

515
00:38:04,919 --> 00:38:07,789
...number 23, Kit Keller!

516
00:38:09,657 --> 00:38:13,160
Count's 2 balls and no strikes to
Rockford's big catcher, Dottie Hinson.

517
00:38:14,261 --> 00:38:16,030
And it's in the dirt. 3 and 0.

518
00:38:16,764 --> 00:38:19,633
Let's see if Jimmy Dugan gives her
the green light on 3 and 0...

519
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,801
...or gives her the take sign.

520
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,638
Game's tied 2-2,
the bottom of the 9th...

521
00:38:26,372 --> 00:38:28,841
...with two runners in scoring position
and only 1 out.

522
00:38:29,709 --> 00:38:31,277
From the belt, here's the delivery.

523
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:38,183
Oh, baby! She hit the cream cheese
out of that one!

524
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:44,289
Jimmy Dugan, master strategist,
had her swinging away!

525
00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:46,824
He sure knows his baseball.

526
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,260
Come on, Dottie!

527
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:50,895
Make me proud!

528
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:53,664
A 3-run clout for Dottie Hinson...

529
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:55,866
...and Rockford wins it, 5 to 2.

530
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:02,405
Dottie, ladies and gentlemen! Dottie!

531
00:39:03,206 --> 00:39:05,408
I couldn't believe you hit it
right out there!

532
00:39:09,945 --> 00:39:11,380
Can we have your autograph?

533
00:39:12,014 --> 00:39:12,948
Can we, Jimmy?

534
00:39:13,615 --> 00:39:14,983
Not today, boys.

535
00:39:15,917 --> 00:39:17,085
Come back next game.

536
00:39:25,526 --> 00:39:26,894
Nice piece of coaching.

537
00:39:27,428 --> 00:39:30,631
Especially in the 5th inning when you
scratched your balls for an hour.

538
00:39:31,898 --> 00:39:34,134
Anything worth doing
is worth doing right.

539
00:39:35,702 --> 00:39:36,369
Yes, indeed.

540
00:39:36,736 --> 00:39:39,405
Until you did that, I couldn't tell
if you were drunk or dead.

541
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:47,880
It was made very clear to me
what I'm supposed to do here.

542
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:52,817
I smile...

543
00:39:53,818 --> 00:39:56,621
...wave my little hat, and I did that.
So when do I get paid?

544
00:39:58,556 --> 00:40:00,958
You have some good ballplayers.
If you'll only-

545
00:40:01,826 --> 00:40:02,960
Ballplayers!

546
00:40:03,561 --> 00:40:05,696
I haven't got ballplayers!
I've got girls!

547
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:09,633
Girls are what you sleep with after
the game, not what you coach during it.

548
00:40:15,805 --> 00:40:18,808
If we paid you more, could you be
just a little more disgusting?

549
00:40:19,775 --> 00:40:21,410
I could certainly use the money.

550
00:40:25,581 --> 00:40:27,916
On the home front...

551
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,585
...they find them everywhere...

552
00:40:31,319 --> 00:40:33,588
...North, East, South and West,
and even Canada.:

553
00:40:34,489 --> 00:40:37,291
Players for the new
All-American Girls' Baseball League.

554
00:40:42,463 --> 00:40:43,764
After a month of play...

555
00:40:44,298 --> 00:40:47,300
...the shine still isn't off
these Diamond Gals.

556
00:40:49,102 --> 00:40:50,603
Alice "Skeeter" Gaspers says...

557
00:40:51,237 --> 00:40:54,173
..."Legging out a triple is no reason
to let your nose get shiny. "

558
00:40:55,107 --> 00:40:57,643
Betty Grable has nothing on these gals.

559
00:40:59,411 --> 00:41:02,481
Helen Haley has not only been on
several championship amateur teams...

560
00:41:03,448 --> 00:41:05,784
...she's also an accomplished
coffeemaker.

561
00:41:08,786 --> 00:41:09,921
With her husband in the Pacific...

562
00:41:10,421 --> 00:41:12,690
...Betty Horn enjoys
cooking spaghetti and knitting.

563
00:41:13,457 --> 00:41:15,726
Her teammates call her
"Betty Spaghetti. "

564
00:41:17,361 --> 00:41:19,963
Ellen Sue Gotlander is
a former Miss Georgia.

565
00:41:22,866 --> 00:41:24,567
Then there's pretty Dottie Hinson...

566
00:41:25,201 --> 00:41:26,970
...who plays like Gehrig
and looks like Garbo.

567
00:41:27,637 --> 00:41:30,439
Fellas, keep your mitts to yourselves.
She's married.

568
00:41:32,341 --> 00:41:35,978
And there's her kid sister Kit,
who's as single as they come.

569
00:41:37,146 --> 00:41:40,782
Enough concentrated "oomph" for
a whole carload of Hollywood starlets.

570
00:41:42,517 --> 00:41:44,419
And how about Marla Hooch?

571
00:41:46,187 --> 00:41:47,388
What a hitter!

572
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:49,390
What a lead!

573
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:52,059
But girls playing baseball?

574
00:42:09,442 --> 00:42:10,609
- Enjoy that?
- Yeah!

575
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:13,378
Good. Come back next game, will you?

576
00:42:17,782 --> 00:42:19,417
I'm Evelyn Gardner.

577
00:42:22,487 --> 00:42:24,188
I play right field.

578
00:42:26,824 --> 00:42:27,892
For us.

579
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:35,799
I just spoke to my husband last night.

580
00:42:36,566 --> 00:42:38,968
He says I can't leave our son
with him at home anymore.

581
00:42:39,869 --> 00:42:42,605
See, he says he's too busy reading
the want ads...

582
00:42:45,741 --> 00:42:49,178
...and I should just take him with me
and shut up about it. So can I?

583
00:42:51,346 --> 00:42:53,482
Take my son with me on road trips?

584
00:43:00,755 --> 00:43:02,189
Ballplayers...!

585
00:43:10,697 --> 00:43:12,866
He's the sweetest little boy.

586
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:15,602
Everyone's just gonna love him.

587
00:43:31,716 --> 00:43:33,551
Get this brat off of me!

588
00:43:39,323 --> 00:43:40,257
That's it! I quit!

589
00:43:40,691 --> 00:43:42,326
Stilwell, angel, come to Mommy.

590
00:43:43,427 --> 00:43:45,395
- You're too young to drive.
- I will. Watch.

591
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:47,731
Evelyn!

592
00:43:48,331 --> 00:43:51,267
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to
kill your son!

593
00:43:52,669 --> 00:43:54,103
Wait! The girls have a game!

594
00:43:54,704 --> 00:43:56,739
You can't leave us like this!
Please, Mr. Goosatelli!

595
00:43:57,506 --> 00:44:00,042
Get over here, Stilwell!
I'm gonna kill you!

596
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:03,011
You can't catch me!

597
00:44:04,246 --> 00:44:06,281
Don't use my bat, use Marla's!
It's heavier!

598
00:44:07,048 --> 00:44:09,517
- Evelyn, why is he so wild?
- I don't know.

599
00:44:10,618 --> 00:44:13,554
Stilwell, angel,
have another chocolate bar.

600
00:44:15,089 --> 00:44:16,023
Gimme! Gimme!

601
00:44:16,624 --> 00:44:19,626
You can't leave us like this.
We're in the middle of nowhere!

602
00:44:20,627 --> 00:44:22,129
- We can't be here!
- No!

603
00:44:26,433 --> 00:44:27,867
Keep him away from me!

604
00:44:28,735 --> 00:44:30,503
He's really a sweetie, Dottie.

605
00:44:31,237 --> 00:44:34,173
- I hope I have five just like him.
- Don't eat the wrapper, honey.

606
00:44:40,879 --> 00:44:42,447
- You gonna come?
- Where you going?

607
00:44:43,882 --> 00:44:45,917
A roadhouse called the Suds Bucket.

608
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:48,386
No, I'm married. I'm...

609
00:44:48,953 --> 00:44:52,156
Come on, you ain't on the farm anymore.
Live a little bit.

610
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:54,592
Girls!

611
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:55,693
Please!

612
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:58,829
Mr. Goosatelli shan't be returning.

613
00:45:01,932 --> 00:45:04,067
How you gonna get past Miss Cuthbert?

614
00:45:05,068 --> 00:45:07,036
Mae's gonna poison her dinner.

615
00:45:19,581 --> 00:45:20,815
What is it, baby?

616
00:45:38,932 --> 00:45:40,967
What the hell is going on?!

617
00:45:42,402 --> 00:45:43,336
Why are we stopped?

618
00:45:43,803 --> 00:45:44,604
Lou quit.

619
00:45:45,905 --> 00:45:46,839
Who's Lou?

620
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:49,642
The driver.

621
00:45:51,343 --> 00:45:53,045
A car could've came by now.

622
00:45:54,679 --> 00:45:56,514
- Get on the bus!
- Was that English?

623
00:46:00,018 --> 00:46:01,652
I loved you in The Wizard of Oz.

624
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:13,430
In the 43 years I've practised medicine,
I never saw a woman throw up that much.

625
00:46:14,631 --> 00:46:16,800
Maybe that's how
she entertains herself, doc.

626
00:46:23,339 --> 00:46:24,707
Hurry! Come on!

627
00:46:25,774 --> 00:46:26,709
Quiet!

628
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:28,677
Mae, what did you give her?

629
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:32,113
Who cares? It's working.

630
00:46:51,164 --> 00:46:52,932
I'm going, baby!

631
00:46:53,633 --> 00:46:55,068
Come on, way to go, Mae!

632
00:47:05,611 --> 00:47:06,278
I'm coming in!

633
00:47:43,545 --> 00:47:44,980
Catch me!

634
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:48,616
Did you see me, Kit? I pretzeled!

635
00:47:58,192 --> 00:48:00,594
- How'd you learn to do that?
- She taught me.

636
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:04,597
My father owns a dance hall, upstate.
innie's Dance Girls Deluxe.

637
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:07,333
She was a dancer, I was a bouncer.

638
00:49:00,715 --> 00:49:01,516
You were great!

639
00:49:12,526 --> 00:49:14,995
- Thanks for the ride, kid.
- What's your rush, dollbody?

640
00:49:15,929 --> 00:49:19,065
What do you say we slip in the back seat
and you make a man out of me?

641
00:49:21,768 --> 00:49:23,536
What do you say I smack you around?

642
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:25,337
Can't we do both?

643
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,781
No, I'm not hot. It's fine.

644
00:49:38,116 --> 00:49:39,484
It's really cold.

645
00:49:40,751 --> 00:49:42,320
- That's better.
- Where's Kit?

646
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:45,122
I think she's on the dance floor.
There she is.

647
00:49:45,889 --> 00:49:48,358
I got my truck parked outside.

648
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:52,462
Sorry, we gotta go. Come on.
Alice, come on.

649
00:49:53,263 --> 00:49:54,697
We gotta go. We got trouble.

650
00:49:55,365 --> 00:49:58,801
- I knew it. You killed Miss Cuthbert.
- We'll bury her. I know a guy-

651
00:50:00,636 --> 00:50:03,639
Lowenstein's coming.
He catches us, we're out of the league.

652
00:50:04,606 --> 00:50:07,409
Let's make like a bread truck
and haul buns, ladies.

653
00:50:09,444 --> 00:50:11,079
Let's duck out the back door.

654
00:50:12,714 --> 00:50:14,282
Is this all? Marla didn't come?

655
00:50:14,949 --> 00:50:16,050
She came.

656
00:50:18,052 --> 00:50:19,353
Well, where is she?

657
00:50:21,488 --> 00:50:22,356
There.

658
00:50:24,258 --> 00:50:26,460
Thinkin' of you

659
00:50:29,095 --> 00:50:32,165
Some others I've seen

660
00:50:37,703 --> 00:50:38,804
What did you do to her?

661
00:50:39,305 --> 00:50:40,472
We just gave her a dress.

662
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,341
And a lot of liquor!

663
00:50:45,944 --> 00:50:48,113
You guys go ahead. I'll get Marla.

664
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:53,384
Hurry up, ladies!

665
00:50:53,818 --> 00:50:54,618
Thanks.

666
00:50:56,654 --> 00:50:58,555
Gave me a thrill

667
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:01,825
With all your faults

668
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,427
I love you still

669
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:06,896
It had to be you

670
00:51:08,431 --> 00:51:09,866
Wonderful you

671
00:51:11,467 --> 00:51:13,369
It had to be you

672
00:51:16,672 --> 00:51:18,574
It had to be you

673
00:51:23,011 --> 00:51:24,779
It had to be you

674
00:51:30,251 --> 00:51:31,485
Marla, honey? We gotta go.

675
00:51:32,753 --> 00:51:35,122
I'm singing to Nelson! Ain't I, baby?

676
00:51:36,156 --> 00:51:37,257
You sure are.

677
00:51:41,928 --> 00:51:43,563
I could take her home.

678
00:51:44,163 --> 00:51:45,331
It'd be an honour.

679
00:51:45,832 --> 00:51:47,133
Ain't he something?

680
00:51:48,034 --> 00:51:50,202
Could make me be blue

681
00:52:00,011 --> 00:52:02,947
That's the second time he dropped
that Bible since she's been in there.

682
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:17,827
Come on, girls.

683
00:52:18,795 --> 00:52:19,729
Mae, what'd you say?

684
00:52:20,163 --> 00:52:20,964
Everything.

685
00:52:21,464 --> 00:52:23,232
Here's a good job for you, Jimmy.

686
00:52:24,867 --> 00:52:26,836
Managing girl ballplayers.

687
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:30,906
You go out there and you wave
your little hat around.

688
00:52:32,374 --> 00:52:33,809
Don't drink!

689
00:52:34,643 --> 00:52:37,645
Why would I want to drink?
I'm a goddamn Peach!

690
00:52:41,482 --> 00:52:44,418
God, double play.
Now I'm hitting like a girl.

691
00:52:45,386 --> 00:52:47,921
"But be nice to them.
They're good ballplayers."

692
00:52:48,856 --> 00:52:50,957
There, catch that, blondie!

693
00:52:54,894 --> 00:52:56,196
Now batting for the Rockford Peaches...

694
00:52:56,796 --> 00:52:58,431
...number 5, centre fielder...

695
00:52:59,365 --> 00:53:01,267
...Mae Mordabito!

696
00:53:04,003 --> 00:53:05,204
Here's the pitch.

697
00:53:06,338 --> 00:53:07,973
There's a shot into right centre!

698
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,075
It's up the alley!

699
00:53:11,176 --> 00:53:13,278
She's turning around 1 st!
She's digging up the dirt!

700
00:53:14,312 --> 00:53:15,580
She's heading past 2nd.

701
00:53:17,248 --> 00:53:18,249
She's heading into 3rd!

702
00:53:18,749 --> 00:53:20,518
Dirt in the skirt, Mae!
Dirt in the skirt!

703
00:53:21,919 --> 00:53:24,254
- Safe!
- She's in there with a triple!

704
00:53:25,122 --> 00:53:27,524
Boy, did she smack that one
right on the kisser.

705
00:53:28,358 --> 00:53:30,393
No wonder they call her
"All-the-Way" Mae.

706
00:53:33,062 --> 00:53:34,197
Triple.

707
00:53:35,198 --> 00:53:36,065
Next batter...

708
00:53:36,566 --> 00:53:39,802
...number 32, 2nd baseman,
Marla Hooch.

709
00:53:42,237 --> 00:53:45,374
Evelyn, look at this!
I've got Stilwell's snack on my cleat!

710
00:53:56,384 --> 00:53:57,685
What are you, stupid?

711
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:01,955
Somebody's gotta run the team.
Someone who actually watches the games.

712
00:54:03,023 --> 00:54:05,492
You're gonna squeeze bunt
with our best hitter?

713
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:08,194
What's the sign to swing away?

714
00:54:09,095 --> 00:54:10,663
Hey, blond girl!
What's the sign?

715
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:13,032
It's the letters.
A squeeze'll work.

716
00:54:13,666 --> 00:54:15,501
Stop thinking with your tits. Batter!

717
00:54:17,269 --> 00:54:17,936
Time!

718
00:54:43,426 --> 00:54:44,094
Come on!

719
00:54:45,295 --> 00:54:47,130
Who is the goddamn manager here?
I am!

720
00:54:47,797 --> 00:54:49,498
Then act like it, you big lush!

721
00:54:50,833 --> 00:54:53,569
- You tell him, Dottie!
- About time someone told him.

722
00:54:57,205 --> 00:54:58,840
- I'm ready now.
- Play ball!

723
00:55:07,415 --> 00:55:09,250
Way to go, whatever your name is!

724
00:55:13,287 --> 00:55:14,588
Good bluff!

725
00:55:18,091 --> 00:55:20,060
But I still say
you're not ballplayers.

726
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,637
Cemetery boneyard! Cross your fingers
or you'll never get another hit.

727
00:55:33,405 --> 00:55:34,506
Sound it out.

728
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:37,475
Kimono.

729
00:55:37,942 --> 00:55:40,078
Kimono off and...

730
00:55:42,046 --> 00:55:43,047
...gra-bed...

731
00:55:43,581 --> 00:55:44,582
Grabbed.

732
00:55:45,249 --> 00:55:46,050
...her...

733
00:55:50,087 --> 00:55:51,255
...milky...

734
00:55:52,889 --> 00:55:54,124
...milky white...

735
00:55:54,624 --> 00:55:56,192
What are you giving her to read?

736
00:55:56,793 --> 00:55:58,561
What's the difference?
She's reading.

737
00:55:59,228 --> 00:56:00,329
That's the important thing.

738
00:56:00,797 --> 00:56:01,797
Go away! Go! Shoo!

739
00:56:02,265 --> 00:56:03,332
Go ahead, Shirley.

740
00:56:03,833 --> 00:56:04,567
Thanks.

741
00:56:07,069 --> 00:56:08,137
Milky...

742
00:56:08,637 --> 00:56:09,638
...white...

743
00:56:14,609 --> 00:56:15,777
...breasts.

744
00:56:18,413 --> 00:56:20,381
It gets really good after that.

745
00:56:21,449 --> 00:56:23,851
- A delivery boy walks in...
- What are you doing?

746
00:56:24,652 --> 00:56:25,819
I'm writing a song.

747
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,488
Really? What's it about?

748
00:56:29,289 --> 00:56:30,457
About us.

749
00:56:31,224 --> 00:56:32,325
Could you teach it to me?

750
00:56:32,792 --> 00:56:34,494
Doris, is this your boyfriend?

751
00:56:37,663 --> 00:56:38,831
Is it out of focus?

752
00:56:39,498 --> 00:56:40,933
No, that's how he looks.

753
00:56:43,836 --> 00:56:45,671
Looks aren't the most important thing.

754
00:56:46,405 --> 00:56:49,975
Right. The important thing is he's
stupid, out of work and treats me bad.

755
00:56:51,409 --> 00:56:52,610
Then why...?

756
00:56:53,278 --> 00:56:55,179
Why? What do you think? Because...

757
00:56:56,113 --> 00:56:57,748
...none of the other boys ever...

758
00:56:59,116 --> 00:57:01,218
Always made me feel like I was wrong.

759
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:05,489
Like I was some sort of a weird girl
or a strange girl...

760
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:08,892
...or not even a girl,
just because I could play.

761
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,128
I believed them too. But not anymore.

762
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:15,331
I mean, look. There's a lot of us.

763
00:57:16,165 --> 00:57:17,533
I think we're all all right.

764
00:57:19,335 --> 00:57:20,436
We are.

765
00:57:23,505 --> 00:57:24,439
Give me that.

766
00:57:30,178 --> 00:57:31,546
So long, Charlie!

767
00:57:37,017 --> 00:57:39,887
So with 2 runs in the 6th,
South Bend gets even.

768
00:57:42,789 --> 00:57:44,557
I've gotta go! I've gotta go!

769
00:57:45,525 --> 00:57:47,160
You shake it off. Shake it off.

770
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:52,765
Say, Evelyn, can I ask you a question?

771
00:57:56,268 --> 00:57:57,503
Which team do you play for?

772
00:57:59,705 --> 00:58:01,740
- I'm a Peach.
- Well, I was just wondering...

773
00:58:02,607 --> 00:58:04,943
...because I couldn't figure out why
you'd throw home...

774
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:07,211
...when we've got a 2-run lead!

775
00:58:07,845 --> 00:58:10,648
You let the tying run get on 2nd,
and we lost the lead!

776
00:58:11,615 --> 00:58:12,917
You start using your head!

777
00:58:13,550 --> 00:58:16,486
That's that lump that's three feet
above your ass!

778
00:58:25,128 --> 00:58:26,129
Are you crying?

779
00:58:28,164 --> 00:58:29,031
Are you crying?

780
00:58:29,498 --> 00:58:30,733
Are you crying?!

781
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:32,668
There's no crying!

782
00:58:33,335 --> 00:58:35,037
There's no crying in baseball!

783
00:58:35,671 --> 00:58:36,905
Leave her alone, Jimmy.

784
00:58:37,506 --> 00:58:38,640
You zip it, Doris!

785
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:42,410
Rogers Hornsby, my manager,
called me a 'talking pile of pig shit'!

786
00:58:43,411 --> 00:58:45,313
That was when my parents came
from Michigan...

787
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:48,215
...to see me play the game!
And did I cry?

788
00:58:50,417 --> 00:58:51,518
No! Do you know why?

789
00:58:52,686 --> 00:58:55,689
Because there's no crying in baseball.
No crying in baseball!

790
00:58:56,723 --> 00:58:57,824
No crying!

791
00:58:58,391 --> 00:58:59,759
What's the matter?

792
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:01,594
She's crying, sir.

793
00:59:02,662 --> 00:59:04,497
I didn't mean to do that.

794
00:59:05,498 --> 00:59:07,266
Perhaps you chastised her
too vehemently.

795
00:59:07,933 --> 00:59:10,802
Good rule of thumb: Treat each of them
as you would your mother.

796
00:59:13,505 --> 00:59:16,174
Anyone ever tell you you look like
a penis with a hat on?

797
00:59:17,342 --> 00:59:18,343
You're out of here!

798
00:59:18,810 --> 00:59:20,244
- I heard that!
- You misunderstood.

799
00:59:20,812 --> 00:59:22,046
- Ten seconds!
- You misunderstood!

800
00:59:22,546 --> 00:59:25,216
You can't throw me out knowing
you've got a strike!

801
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:27,451
Off this field!

802
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:33,056
I can't believe no one ever
called you that before!

803
00:59:33,923 --> 00:59:36,326
That's where you belong.
I'm in charge now.

804
00:59:39,262 --> 00:59:41,997
The crowd's light today,
what with the tractor show in town.

805
00:59:42,932 --> 00:59:46,768
If you're nearby, and you must be, since
this isn't a powerful radio station...

806
00:59:48,003 --> 00:59:50,539
...come on down to the ballpark
and bring the kiddies.

807
00:59:52,007 --> 00:59:53,775
People better start showing up.

808
00:59:54,409 --> 00:59:56,310
We don't have fans,
we don't have a league.

809
00:59:57,044 --> 00:59:58,279
Ladies...

810
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:00,748
...you all look wonderful.

811
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:07,154
There's a reporter and a photographer
in the stands from Life magazine.

812
01:00:08,555 --> 01:00:10,123
- We're famous!
- Life magazine?

813
01:00:10,724 --> 01:00:12,225
Don't waste your time.

814
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:16,929
Dottie, I'm trying to get them to do
a story about you.

815
01:00:17,897 --> 01:00:19,331
Me? Why me?

816
01:00:20,132 --> 01:00:22,501
You're the "Queen of Diamonds."
That's what I'm calling you.

817
01:00:24,303 --> 01:00:25,670
Did you tell them about me?

818
01:00:26,271 --> 01:00:28,807
I told them how at first,
the scout didn't even want you...

819
01:00:29,741 --> 01:00:32,143
...but how Dottie wouldn't come
without her kid sister.

820
01:00:33,644 --> 01:00:35,146
They really loved it.

821
01:00:37,081 --> 01:00:38,849
A real human-interest story.

822
01:00:40,951 --> 01:00:44,254
Will you just try to give them
something spectacular out there?

823
01:00:45,355 --> 01:00:46,222
Anything.

824
01:00:46,623 --> 01:00:47,624
What's the matter?

825
01:00:50,259 --> 01:00:52,028
Well, we're not doing so well.

826
01:00:53,095 --> 01:00:56,031
Harvey and the other owners think
they've made a mistake.

827
01:00:57,132 --> 01:00:58,367
They might close you down.

828
01:00:59,968 --> 01:01:01,603
What are you talking about?

829
01:01:02,270 --> 01:01:03,838
They can't close us down here.

830
01:01:04,439 --> 01:01:06,574
- What kind of a thing is that?
- What's it mean?

831
01:01:07,308 --> 01:01:10,111
They're businessmen.
No profit, no product.

832
01:01:11,045 --> 01:01:12,613
And what am I supposed to do?

833
01:01:13,214 --> 01:01:14,915
Go back to taxi dancing?

834
01:01:15,582 --> 01:01:18,385
Ten cents so some slob can sweat
gin all over me?

835
01:01:19,953 --> 01:01:21,388
I'm never doing that again!

836
01:01:22,055 --> 01:01:26,025
So you tell old rich Mr. Chocolate Man
that he ain't closing me down!

837
01:01:27,293 --> 01:01:28,861
They can't keep us from playing!

838
01:01:29,462 --> 01:01:31,030
We'll show them how we play.

839
01:01:32,398 --> 01:01:35,634
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.
I am trying my best.

840
01:01:36,969 --> 01:01:39,571
So will you just give them
everything you've got?

841
01:01:40,438 --> 01:01:41,706
We always do.

842
01:01:46,677 --> 01:01:49,213
A slick play by Alice Gaspers
and there's 2 gone...

843
01:01:50,114 --> 01:01:52,249
...in the 3rd.
That'll bring up Dee Lynch.

844
01:01:55,819 --> 01:01:58,755
Lynch is the most consistent
Belles hitter this year.

845
01:02:00,356 --> 01:02:01,658
Settles in.

846
01:02:04,193 --> 01:02:05,695
Pops it up! Foul.

847
01:02:06,329 --> 01:02:08,097
Hinson should have
no trouble with this.

848
01:02:08,764 --> 01:02:09,565
She's under it.

849
01:02:10,933 --> 01:02:12,034
Uncle Elmore's socks!

850
01:02:12,501 --> 01:02:14,269
What did she do?

851
01:02:17,772 --> 01:02:18,873
I can't do that.

852
01:02:19,407 --> 01:02:20,208
Who can?

853
01:02:20,642 --> 01:02:23,177
- What is her name?
- Dottie Hinson. D-O-T-T-I-E...

854
01:02:24,979 --> 01:02:26,347
What the hell was that?

855
01:02:26,947 --> 01:02:28,849
I just thought it might
help the league.

856
01:02:29,616 --> 01:02:31,451
A goddamn circus!

857
01:02:32,119 --> 01:02:33,553
A double would be nice-

858
01:02:34,154 --> 01:02:35,455
All right!

859
01:02:36,856 --> 01:02:38,424
God knows we have a game.

860
01:02:40,259 --> 01:02:42,528
It's not like any of this helps,
believe me.

861
01:02:54,305 --> 01:02:55,240
That was really nice!

862
01:02:55,673 --> 01:02:59,510
Let's go, girls. Dozens of people are
waiting for the game to start.

863
01:03:27,636 --> 01:03:28,303
Batter!

864
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,808
What is her name?
Hey you, tall girl!

865
01:03:34,542 --> 01:03:35,343
Beverly!

866
01:03:35,810 --> 01:03:37,712
Look sharp, tall-
What is her name?

867
01:03:38,379 --> 01:03:39,680
Beverly. Good.

868
01:03:44,484 --> 01:03:45,852
Five bucks! Five bucks!

869
01:03:51,991 --> 01:03:55,294
What if, at a key moment in the game,
my uniform bursts open...

870
01:03:56,495 --> 01:03:57,863
...and my bosoms fly out?

871
01:03:58,497 --> 01:04:00,699
That might draw a crowd, right?

872
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,969
Think there's men
who ain't seen your bosoms?

873
01:04:04,703 --> 01:04:05,804
Thank you.

874
01:04:07,005 --> 01:04:08,973
- Marla, what you got?
- What about me?

875
01:04:09,707 --> 01:04:11,476
I got a letter from Nelson!

876
01:04:15,045 --> 01:04:16,680
Fly ball as Dottie Hinson brings...

877
01:04:17,314 --> 01:04:19,149
...the crowd to its feet
with a home run!

878
01:04:22,519 --> 01:04:23,453
22!

879
01:04:29,492 --> 01:04:31,127
We love you, 22!

880
01:04:31,761 --> 01:04:33,529
- Come on!
- Open your mouth!

881
01:04:35,331 --> 01:04:36,498
The kid ate the lineup!

882
01:04:39,434 --> 01:04:40,102
Right here.

883
01:04:58,418 --> 01:05:00,387
I'm so happy! Thank you.

884
01:05:06,192 --> 01:05:06,993
I love you.

885
01:05:08,594 --> 01:05:09,962
I'll be back next season.

886
01:05:10,563 --> 01:05:11,997
See you next season!

887
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:20,371
Slide! Slide!

888
01:05:21,406 --> 01:05:22,206
Safe!

889
01:05:22,774 --> 01:05:23,574
Thank you!

890
01:05:24,041 --> 01:05:25,276
Let it up. Let it up.

891
01:05:27,711 --> 01:05:28,712
That was a good one.

892
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:31,482
It's a fly ball to left!

893
01:05:32,849 --> 01:05:35,185
Betty Spaghetti makes the catch!

894
01:05:36,353 --> 01:05:39,088
Heads up! Spaghetti makes the throw!
It's gonna be close!

895
01:05:41,858 --> 01:05:43,826
Aunt Edna's bridgework! She is out!

896
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:46,896
Dottie Hinson held onto the ball!

897
01:05:47,730 --> 01:05:49,031
Oh, doctor!

898
01:05:52,234 --> 01:05:53,735
A lot of ballplayers use it.

899
01:06:07,648 --> 01:06:08,949
High foul pop.

900
01:06:09,583 --> 01:06:10,584
It's coming back!

901
01:06:12,953 --> 01:06:14,521
She caught it! Unbelievable!

902
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:18,357
Full house on its feet
cheering Dottie Hinson!

903
01:06:24,596 --> 01:06:25,898
That sounded good.

904
01:06:26,665 --> 01:06:28,800
- You haven't got a curve ball left.
- I don't?!

905
01:06:29,568 --> 01:06:30,936
You haven't had one since-

906
01:06:57,159 --> 01:06:58,160
Safe!

907
01:06:59,094 --> 01:06:59,828
Safe!

908
01:07:31,157 --> 01:07:31,958
He's good-looking.

909
01:07:33,793 --> 01:07:36,462
- What's he do when not in the Army?
- Dairy assistant manager.

910
01:07:37,363 --> 01:07:38,730
He'll be manager. He's smart.

911
01:07:40,265 --> 01:07:42,100
So he's good-looking and smart.

912
01:07:42,834 --> 01:07:44,135
There's so few of us.

913
01:07:46,204 --> 01:07:47,972
Where did you say he was? Italy?

914
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:51,776
I think. I haven't got a letter
from him in three weeks.

915
01:07:52,810 --> 01:07:54,245
I used to get one every week.

916
01:07:56,413 --> 01:07:57,981
That doesn't mean anything.

917
01:07:59,649 --> 01:08:03,286
If he's in combat, it's not like there's
a mailbox on every corner.

918
01:08:04,921 --> 01:08:07,523
If something happened,
you would've got a telegram.

919
01:08:08,457 --> 01:08:09,191
Oh, God, don't-

920
01:08:09,625 --> 01:08:11,961
But he's fine. No, he's fine.

921
01:08:15,797 --> 01:08:17,232
How come you're not in the Army?

922
01:08:19,467 --> 01:08:20,468
I have no cartilage...

923
01:08:21,503 --> 01:08:22,570
...in my knee.

924
01:08:23,037 --> 01:08:24,605
You don't need it to shoot Nazis.

925
01:08:25,206 --> 01:08:27,942
You need this, right? Trigger finger.
I could do that.

926
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:35,415
How did I get so useless so fast?

927
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:42,655
Boys like this on your fingers?

928
01:08:43,289 --> 01:08:44,357
Works for me.

929
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:49,695
Your sister's not gonna be mad?

930
01:08:50,362 --> 01:08:51,597
I don't care.

931
01:08:53,298 --> 01:08:54,466
Listen, when...

932
01:08:55,634 --> 01:08:57,268
- Bob.
- ... Bob comes back...

933
01:08:58,536 --> 01:08:59,971
...will you keep playing?

934
01:09:02,039 --> 01:09:03,040
You could just quit?

935
01:09:03,507 --> 01:09:04,442
Sure.

936
01:09:05,342 --> 01:09:06,477
You play like you love it.

937
01:09:11,148 --> 01:09:13,116
- Does he know how good you are?
- Bob?

938
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:15,218
No, Hitler. Yes, Bob.

939
01:09:16,419 --> 01:09:17,420
How good am I?

940
01:09:21,424 --> 01:09:22,591
You stink.

941
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:24,693
You're lousy.

942
01:09:25,894 --> 01:09:29,298
You're only the best player
in the league. You don't know that?

943
01:09:32,534 --> 01:09:33,768
You ever been married?

944
01:09:36,371 --> 01:09:37,872
Let me think. Yeah, twice.

945
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:40,007
Any children?

946
01:09:41,242 --> 01:09:42,510
One of them was.

947
01:09:45,712 --> 01:09:47,147
Is she out?

948
01:09:48,749 --> 01:09:50,717
I think it's time for a drink.

949
01:09:52,318 --> 01:09:53,953
Hang on. Hang on.

950
01:09:56,689 --> 01:09:58,124
These really don't mix.

951
01:10:12,403 --> 01:10:14,439
- Good, huh?
- Oh, yeah. It's great.

952
01:10:21,612 --> 01:10:22,546
Fair ball!

953
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:31,454
Time!

954
01:10:31,888 --> 01:10:34,023
Jimmy Dugan pops his head
out of the dugout.

955
01:10:34,757 --> 01:10:36,926
He's on his way to talk to his hurler.

956
01:10:38,227 --> 01:10:40,329
Kit Keller looks mighty tired.

957
01:10:42,097 --> 01:10:43,398
Game's getting exciting.

958
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:46,601
I'll finish it right here.

959
01:10:47,135 --> 01:10:48,569
I'll strike this turkey out.

960
01:10:50,104 --> 01:10:51,472
Betty's ready to come in.

961
01:10:52,073 --> 01:10:54,041
Come on. I've never been
taken out before.

962
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:55,542
Ask Dottie.

963
01:10:56,877 --> 01:10:58,579
I really wanna finish this game.

964
01:10:59,613 --> 01:11:00,480
Please?

965
01:11:04,084 --> 01:11:04,818
What do you think?

966
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:09,188
Well, you know, she's battling.

967
01:11:11,057 --> 01:11:11,991
What do you think?

968
01:11:14,193 --> 01:11:15,627
She's throwing grapefruits.

969
01:11:20,131 --> 01:11:23,902
It looks like Keller's coming out of
the game, and she is not happy about it!

970
01:11:25,370 --> 01:11:26,938
Nice job, Kit!

971
01:11:28,039 --> 01:11:31,108
Betty Horn sprints in
from the left-field bullpen.

972
01:11:33,977 --> 01:11:37,047
Look at this crowd. This is great!
They're jumping, cheering...

973
01:11:38,081 --> 01:11:39,349
...and they paid to get in.

974
01:11:39,883 --> 01:11:42,085
You did a fabulous job.
I won't forget this.

975
01:11:42,885 --> 01:11:46,122
Thank you very much, Mr. Harvey.
I appreciate it, coming from you.

976
01:11:47,323 --> 01:11:50,826
But to be perfectly honest, I think
the girls deserve most of the credit.

977
01:11:51,994 --> 01:11:52,794
They're great.

978
01:11:53,228 --> 01:11:56,031
Fortunately, we won't need
them anymore. Do you want a peanut?

979
01:11:56,965 --> 01:11:58,266
No. What do you mean?

980
01:11:59,767 --> 01:12:01,069
What do I mean?

981
01:12:01,636 --> 01:12:04,105
We're winning the war.
Our situation changed.

982
01:12:04,939 --> 01:12:08,375
Roosevelt himself said,
"Men's baseball won't be shut down."

983
01:12:09,443 --> 01:12:11,478
So we won't need the girls next year.

984
01:12:14,748 --> 01:12:17,750
Bases loaded. Bottom of the 9th.
Rockford up, 6 to 2. Two men out.

985
01:12:18,718 --> 01:12:20,553
No balls, 2 strikes.

986
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:23,789
Strike 3!

987
01:12:25,291 --> 01:12:28,660
And that is the ball game!
Rockford is in the playoffs!

988
01:12:32,230 --> 01:12:35,033
I love these girls.
I don't need them, but I love them.

989
01:12:35,934 --> 01:12:37,035
Come on. Let's go.

990
01:12:38,569 --> 01:12:40,771
Look at me. I'm full of peanuts!

991
01:12:41,572 --> 01:12:43,474
I've got peanuts all over myself.

992
01:12:44,141 --> 01:12:46,610
This is what it's gonna be like
in the factories too.

993
01:12:48,078 --> 01:12:49,713
"Men are back.
Turn in your rivets."

994
01:12:50,847 --> 01:12:53,583
First, it was their patriotic duty
to get out and go to work.

995
01:12:54,484 --> 01:12:56,953
When the men come back,
they're sent back to the kitchen.

996
01:12:58,588 --> 01:13:02,291
Should we send the boys returning
from war back to the kitchen? Come on.

997
01:13:06,194 --> 01:13:08,864
Do you know how dedicated they are?
What they go through?

998
01:13:09,798 --> 01:13:11,966
They play with sprained ankles,
broken fingers.

999
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:15,436
They ride a bus all night to play
a double-header the next day!

1000
01:13:16,871 --> 01:13:18,305
I'll make it up to them.

1001
01:13:18,939 --> 01:13:20,140
What? With Harvey Bars?

1002
01:13:20,641 --> 01:13:22,776
I'm getting tired of listening
to you, Ira.

1003
01:13:25,345 --> 01:13:28,014
I'd like your permission
to take over the league.

1004
01:13:30,049 --> 01:13:32,251
Do you understand?
All of the owners are getting out.

1005
01:13:33,052 --> 01:13:34,687
There's no point to it anymore.

1006
01:13:35,321 --> 01:13:37,590
Just let them finish the season,
and that's it!

1007
01:13:38,357 --> 01:13:41,727
I sold your product when there was
no product. This is a product!

1008
01:13:43,962 --> 01:13:46,765
There is no room for girls' baseball
in this country...

1009
01:13:47,665 --> 01:13:49,434
...once the war is over.

1010
01:13:50,535 --> 01:13:51,269
They're through.

1011
01:13:52,803 --> 01:13:54,238
I think you're wrong.

1012
01:13:55,506 --> 01:13:57,775
And I'm gonna prove it to you,
Mr. Harvey!

1013
01:13:59,343 --> 01:14:02,546
Hi, my name's Mae. That's more
than a name, that's an attitude.

1014
01:14:04,014 --> 01:14:07,016
Here's my friend Doris.
Best player on the team.

1015
01:14:08,351 --> 01:14:09,986
- Thank you.
- You're the best.

1016
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:13,189
- The game put us in the playoffs.
- I could've finished.

1017
01:14:14,023 --> 01:14:15,524
Stilwell could've hit off you.

1018
01:14:17,326 --> 01:14:19,795
What's the matter?
Too big to finish your own games now?

1019
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:27,035
Don't start with me, Kit!

1020
01:14:27,568 --> 01:14:29,070
Don't you start with me!

1021
01:14:29,670 --> 01:14:30,905
Kit, come on, cut it out!

1022
01:14:35,075 --> 01:14:37,044
What the hell are you doing?!

1023
01:14:46,886 --> 01:14:49,155
- Get your sister off of her!
- Stay out of it!

1024
01:14:57,028 --> 01:14:58,730
You just wait, Doris!

1025
01:14:59,664 --> 01:15:01,166
Let me down!

1026
01:15:04,001 --> 01:15:05,570
Let me down!

1027
01:15:11,008 --> 01:15:13,377
You stay down there and you cool off!

1028
01:15:18,915 --> 01:15:21,451
- Why'd she do it?
- She was vulnerable. You provoked her.

1029
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:24,587
- Shut up, Helen!
- You're making her more upset.

1030
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:26,222
Really!

1031
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:28,590
- I don't need it from Helen.
- Take a shower.

1032
01:15:29,324 --> 01:15:32,961
- I'm not taking a shower.
- She reminds me of my husband.

1033
01:15:37,899 --> 01:15:40,001
Save some hot water for me, you guys.

1034
01:15:40,768 --> 01:15:41,702
You okay?

1035
01:15:43,604 --> 01:15:45,439
My rear end hurts where he dropped me.

1036
01:15:46,106 --> 01:15:47,241
You acted like a baby.

1037
01:15:48,742 --> 01:15:49,843
You treat me like one.

1038
01:15:50,744 --> 01:15:52,879
I treated you like a pitcher
who'd lost her stuff.

1039
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:56,883
When Betty's in trouble,
you back her up every pitch!

1040
01:15:58,017 --> 01:16:01,320
I seem to remember last week, somebody
throwing a resin bag in my face.

1041
01:16:02,388 --> 01:16:05,391
Told me to get my fat ass behind
the plate. Was that you or the umpire?

1042
01:16:06,391 --> 01:16:07,960
You could've backed me up today...

1043
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:10,395
...instead of holding me back.

1044
01:16:11,062 --> 01:16:12,130
I hold you back?

1045
01:16:16,868 --> 01:16:18,102
It's like at home.

1046
01:16:18,636 --> 01:16:20,905
It's like if you're here,
then I'm not here.

1047
01:16:22,106 --> 01:16:22,906
What's that mean?

1048
01:16:24,408 --> 01:16:27,010
I don't know what I mean.
I know I'm wrong.

1049
01:16:27,911 --> 01:16:30,714
I know you're right and I'm wrong.
I know that. I just-

1050
01:16:34,283 --> 01:16:35,985
I just get so mad!

1051
01:16:37,753 --> 01:16:39,188
Why do you gotta be so good?

1052
01:16:55,202 --> 01:16:57,505
Dottie, here you are.
You weren't on the bus.

1053
01:16:58,272 --> 01:16:59,540
Can I speak to you a minute?

1054
01:17:03,210 --> 01:17:04,311
I have to leave.

1055
01:17:04,811 --> 01:17:07,280
Don't worry.
The bus wouldn't leave without you.

1056
01:17:08,281 --> 01:17:09,649
I'm leaving the team.

1057
01:17:11,117 --> 01:17:11,984
What?

1058
01:17:12,451 --> 01:17:14,086
- Why? What-
- I have to go home.

1059
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:16,922
Home? You can't go home now.

1060
01:17:17,990 --> 01:17:19,625
This couldn't come at a worse time.

1061
01:17:20,292 --> 01:17:23,728
We're in a bit of a crisis,
and I have to try to pull something off.

1062
01:17:24,796 --> 01:17:26,998
It's not a good time to lose
our most popular player.

1063
01:17:27,799 --> 01:17:30,935
- What's the problem?
- I don't want to talk about it.

1064
01:17:32,136 --> 01:17:33,270
It's personal?

1065
01:17:36,774 --> 01:17:38,141
It's one of the girls, isn't it?

1066
01:17:38,675 --> 01:17:39,910
It's Mae, right?

1067
01:17:42,479 --> 01:17:44,881
Kit, that's it.
I've noticed there's some friction.

1068
01:17:45,682 --> 01:17:48,618
That's fine. No problem.
Doesn't mean you have to quit.

1069
01:17:49,652 --> 01:17:50,886
I can arrange a trade.

1070
01:17:51,454 --> 01:17:53,289
Racine? Kenosha? South Bend?

1071
01:17:54,656 --> 01:17:55,657
Trade me or whatever.

1072
01:17:56,124 --> 01:17:58,460
But figure it out by tomorrow,
or I'm going home.

1073
01:17:59,694 --> 01:18:02,997
Tomorrow? Fine! I'll work
everything out by tomorrow.

1074
01:18:04,032 --> 01:18:06,000
You really gave me a scare
for a second.

1075
01:18:08,269 --> 01:18:10,304
Does anybody have any extra hose?

1076
01:18:11,138 --> 01:18:12,906
Does anybody have any extra hose?

1077
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,075
Mae, your date's here.

1078
01:18:16,510 --> 01:18:18,211
- How do I look?
- Where'd you get that dress?

1079
01:18:18,979 --> 01:18:20,880
- Borrowed it.
- It don't fit. Too tight.

1080
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:23,783
I don't plan on wearing it that long.

1081
01:18:24,517 --> 01:18:26,786
I don't know why
you get dressed at all.

1082
01:18:30,356 --> 01:18:31,457
Where's Dottie?

1083
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:32,991
In there.

1084
01:18:33,792 --> 01:18:35,360
Wanna go to the movies with me?

1085
01:18:37,429 --> 01:18:38,730
You bitch!

1086
01:18:39,964 --> 01:18:41,666
I've been traded to Racine!

1087
01:18:43,801 --> 01:18:44,535
You?

1088
01:18:44,969 --> 01:18:46,670
I told them to trade me.

1089
01:18:47,338 --> 01:18:49,873
They'd really trade you.
Miss Star, Miss Perfect.

1090
01:18:50,807 --> 01:18:52,109
You knew what would happen!

1091
01:18:52,843 --> 01:18:55,312
- I didn't!
- This'll be better than the movies.

1092
01:18:56,446 --> 01:18:59,749
- I'll quit. Is that what you want?
- They'll blame me for you quitting!

1093
01:19:00,783 --> 01:19:01,918
What do you want me to do?

1094
01:19:02,551 --> 01:19:05,487
Stay away from me. Leave me alone!
That's what I want you to do!

1095
01:19:06,722 --> 01:19:07,456
Kit, listen.

1096
01:19:07,856 --> 01:19:09,691
It was all a mistake.
A big mistake.

1097
01:19:10,359 --> 01:19:12,127
- I was getting too good.
- You won't listen.

1098
01:19:12,794 --> 01:19:15,730
I knew if I did too good,
you'd do something to push me down!

1099
01:19:24,505 --> 01:19:26,206
Kit, blow it out your rear end!

1100
01:19:26,874 --> 01:19:28,442
I'm sick of you blaming me.

1101
01:19:29,142 --> 01:19:30,377
I got you into this league!

1102
01:19:31,044 --> 01:19:31,978
She got her in the league!

1103
01:19:32,512 --> 01:19:35,048
- I didn't wanna be here!
- Then why are you still here?

1104
01:19:39,819 --> 01:19:41,587
Kit wants to know why
she's playing.

1105
01:19:43,722 --> 01:19:45,824
My train leaves at 8.
I got 10 minutes to pack.

1106
01:19:47,692 --> 01:19:49,327
If you have trouble,
you know who to blame.

1107
01:19:49,995 --> 01:19:51,162
See you in the World Series.

1108
01:19:51,663 --> 01:19:52,797
You bet you will.

1109
01:19:53,331 --> 01:19:54,766
Don't look at her.

1110
01:19:57,835 --> 01:20:00,504
Has anyone seen my new red hat?

1111
01:20:01,905 --> 01:20:03,473
Piss on your hat!

1112
01:20:04,141 --> 01:20:05,776
Well, that seemed uncalled for.

1113
01:20:07,410 --> 01:20:08,478
Just keep it down.

1114
01:20:08,978 --> 01:20:10,079
- Kit's off our team.
- She's not!

1115
01:20:10,647 --> 01:20:11,814
Yes, she is. Are you deaf?

1116
01:20:15,251 --> 01:20:17,019
You need any help in there?

1117
01:20:18,053 --> 01:20:19,755
Don't act like this.

1118
01:20:20,522 --> 01:20:21,790
You're still in the league.

1119
01:20:22,324 --> 01:20:24,993
You're just on another team,
that's all.

1120
01:20:31,399 --> 01:20:33,100
Batter up

1121
01:20:34,035 --> 01:20:36,070
Hear that call

1122
01:20:37,371 --> 01:20:39,273
The time has come

1123
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:42,542
For one and all

1124
01:20:43,443 --> 01:20:46,179
To play

1125
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:48,581
Ball

1126
01:20:49,248 --> 01:20:51,484
For we're the members of

1127
01:20:52,251 --> 01:20:54,787
The All-American League
We come from cities

1128
01:20:55,621 --> 01:20:56,989
Near and far

1129
01:20:57,623 --> 01:20:59,524
We got Canadians

1130
01:21:00,225 --> 01:21:01,459
Irish ones and Swedes

1131
01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:04,996
We're all for one, we're one for all
We're All-Americans

1132
01:21:06,164 --> 01:21:09,100
Each girl stands
Her head so proudly high

1133
01:21:10,101 --> 01:21:11,368
Her motto.: Do or Die

1134
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:15,572
She's not the one to use
Or need an alibi

1135
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:19,976
Our chaperones are not too soft
They're not too tough

1136
01:21:21,444 --> 01:21:23,846
Our managers are on the ball

1137
01:21:26,115 --> 01:21:27,049
Miss Cuthbert...

1138
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:30,019
You gorgeous stack of pancakes!

1139
01:21:32,087 --> 01:21:33,455
Man on the floor!

1140
01:21:34,456 --> 01:21:35,891
Already dressed.

1141
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:39,594
Get Stilwell away.
I don't know what he's doing.

1142
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:41,629
Get him away from the tapes!

1143
01:21:42,196 --> 01:21:43,631
Angel, come here now.

1144
01:21:44,465 --> 01:21:45,399
All right.

1145
01:21:47,134 --> 01:21:48,569
Everybody, let's listen up.

1146
01:21:49,236 --> 01:21:52,372
I was in the toilet reading my contract,
and it turns out I get a bonus...

1147
01:21:53,373 --> 01:21:55,275
...when we get to the World Series.

1148
01:21:55,976 --> 01:21:58,111
Let's play hard! Play smart!
Use your heads!

1149
01:21:58,878 --> 01:22:01,347
That's that lump three feet
above our ass, right?

1150
01:22:04,550 --> 01:22:06,318
Some more prominent than others.

1151
01:22:06,986 --> 01:22:08,053
Come in.

1152
01:22:11,790 --> 01:22:13,291
Excuse me!

1153
01:22:13,892 --> 01:22:15,860
I got a telegram
from the War Department.

1154
01:22:16,561 --> 01:22:17,795
Oh, my God! Ernie!

1155
01:22:19,997 --> 01:22:22,600
Boy, I hate these.
These are the worst.

1156
01:22:24,568 --> 01:22:27,805
The Army could at least send someone
to tell you your husband's dead.

1157
01:22:30,273 --> 01:22:32,042
Darn! I had the name right here!

1158
01:22:34,377 --> 01:22:36,546
I gotta go back
and straighten this out.

1159
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:38,214
Sorry.

1160
01:22:38,948 --> 01:22:42,318
- Just give me the telegram.
- I can't. I don't have a name.

1161
01:22:43,419 --> 01:22:44,720
Just give me the telegram.

1162
01:22:45,287 --> 01:22:47,689
This is official.
This is from the War Department!

1163
01:22:48,490 --> 01:22:49,224
Come on!

1164
01:22:49,658 --> 01:22:51,026
That's official business!

1165
01:22:51,593 --> 01:22:52,594
I'm coming-

1166
01:23:29,928 --> 01:23:32,330
- I'm sorry, Betty.
- No, it's George!

1167
01:23:51,614 --> 01:23:53,049
It's George!

1168
01:24:08,796 --> 01:24:09,897
All right, come on.

1169
01:24:10,798 --> 01:24:12,366
We still got a game to play.

1170
01:24:45,563 --> 01:24:46,564
Come in.

1171
01:24:56,173 --> 01:24:57,340
Hi, cutie.

1172
01:25:05,181 --> 01:25:06,282
How did you...?

1173
01:25:08,050 --> 01:25:09,685
Bob! Oh, my God!

1174
01:25:11,186 --> 01:25:11,920
What happened?

1175
01:25:13,388 --> 01:25:15,157
- I'm fine.
- What is it?

1176
01:25:15,857 --> 01:25:17,359
It was a sniper.

1177
01:25:17,992 --> 01:25:19,093
I was lucky though.

1178
01:25:19,561 --> 01:25:20,995
He got seven of us before we got him.

1179
01:25:23,297 --> 01:25:24,799
Oh, sweetie!

1180
01:25:28,635 --> 01:25:30,204
It's all right. I made it.

1181
01:25:30,837 --> 01:25:31,938
I missed you so much.

1182
01:25:32,506 --> 01:25:33,740
I've been discharged.

1183
01:25:34,341 --> 01:25:36,176
I didn't think
I'd ever see you again.

1184
01:25:36,876 --> 01:25:39,412
It's all over. I'm here, baby.

1185
01:25:41,914 --> 01:25:42,915
Well, listen.

1186
01:25:43,416 --> 01:25:44,984
You have to sit down here.

1187
01:25:46,418 --> 01:25:47,853
I'll clear all this stuff off.

1188
01:25:51,056 --> 01:25:52,691
I almost forgot how beautiful you are.

1189
01:25:53,825 --> 01:25:56,294
- Oh, no. I look terrible!
- You look beautiful.

1190
01:25:59,430 --> 01:26:01,832
You're the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1191
01:26:11,341 --> 01:26:12,409
I love you.

1192
01:26:17,513 --> 01:26:20,116
Can we just hold each other
for the rest of our lives?

1193
01:26:23,285 --> 01:26:24,586
That's my plan.

1194
01:26:38,432 --> 01:26:41,035
Why am I the only one on this bus?
What are we waiting for?

1195
01:26:42,769 --> 01:26:45,238
Are you physically unable
to show up on time?

1196
01:26:46,072 --> 01:26:47,007
Coming, Jimmy.

1197
01:26:48,108 --> 01:26:50,977
If you think you can do without
the batting practice, think again.

1198
01:26:51,911 --> 01:26:53,079
Not the way you hit.

1199
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:56,816
Let's not go to the World Series
without Stilwell's toys!

1200
01:26:57,917 --> 01:27:01,053
- Alice, what time is it where you live?
- It's bad luck to yell before a game.

1201
01:27:05,223 --> 01:27:07,258
- Could you sign my baseball?
- Sure.

1202
01:27:12,029 --> 01:27:14,198
"Avoid the clap. Jimmy Dugan. "

1203
01:27:18,402 --> 01:27:19,903
That's good advice!

1204
01:27:23,573 --> 01:27:25,275
Write to us. We'll miss you.

1205
01:27:25,975 --> 01:27:27,243
We will. Thanks.

1206
01:27:27,777 --> 01:27:29,278
Good luck in the World Series.

1207
01:27:44,125 --> 01:27:45,493
Taking a little day trip?

1208
01:27:47,462 --> 01:27:48,396
Bob and I are...

1209
01:27:48,896 --> 01:27:49,997
...driving home...

1210
01:27:50,598 --> 01:27:51,599
...to Oregon.

1211
01:27:59,072 --> 01:28:00,707
I thought you were a ballplayer.

1212
01:28:02,442 --> 01:28:03,309
You were wrong.

1213
01:28:03,743 --> 01:28:04,477
Was I?

1214
01:28:06,646 --> 01:28:08,280
It is only a game.

1215
01:28:09,181 --> 01:28:11,150
It's only a game,
and I don't need this.

1216
01:28:11,917 --> 01:28:13,485
I have Bob. I don't need this.

1217
01:28:16,955 --> 01:28:20,458
I gave away five years at the end
of my career to drinking.

1218
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:23,428
Five years.

1219
01:28:24,162 --> 01:28:27,431
There isn't anything I wouldn't give
to get back any one day of it.

1220
01:28:30,501 --> 01:28:31,802
Well, we're different.

1221
01:28:36,773 --> 01:28:39,509
Chickenshit! You wanna go home
and make 100 babies, great.

1222
01:28:40,443 --> 01:28:41,878
I can't tell anyone how to live.

1223
01:28:42,478 --> 01:28:44,780
But sneaking out like this,
quitting...

1224
01:28:45,815 --> 01:28:47,449
You'll regret it all your life.

1225
01:28:48,150 --> 01:28:49,585
Baseball is what gets inside you.

1226
01:28:50,252 --> 01:28:52,921
It's what lights you up.
You can't deny that.

1227
01:28:53,989 --> 01:28:55,757
It just got too hard.

1228
01:28:59,093 --> 01:29:00,528
It's supposed to be hard.

1229
01:29:01,429 --> 01:29:03,330
If it wasn't hard,
everyone would do it.

1230
01:29:04,465 --> 01:29:06,567
The hard is what makes it great.

1231
01:29:17,844 --> 01:29:19,078
Everything all right?

1232
01:29:20,846 --> 01:29:22,481
Yeah, fine. Fine.

1233
01:29:23,949 --> 01:29:25,050
Bye, Jimmy.

1234
01:29:46,536 --> 01:29:49,005
First game of the first
women's baseball World Series.

1235
01:29:49,839 --> 01:29:52,442
This is history in the making.
History in the making!

1236
01:30:00,482 --> 01:30:01,717
This is for you.

1237
01:30:02,484 --> 01:30:03,785
We brought you these also.

1238
01:30:04,619 --> 01:30:05,487
For me?

1239
01:30:05,954 --> 01:30:06,621
Thank them!

1240
01:30:27,307 --> 01:30:28,741
- Cut it out!
- I'm sorry.

1241
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:52,029
Two box seats on the 3rd base line.

1242
01:30:52,830 --> 01:30:54,598
I got two box seats. Who wants them?

1243
01:30:55,232 --> 01:30:56,300
- How much?
-10 bucks.

1244
01:30:56,833 --> 01:30:59,569
That's my daughter, 3rd baseman,
Doris Murphy. Best one they got.

1245
01:31:00,503 --> 01:31:02,205
- Where you from?
- Staten Island.

1246
01:31:02,839 --> 01:31:05,308
After the game,
I'm taking her out for a steak dinner.

1247
01:31:06,609 --> 01:31:08,711
All right, all right, all right!

1248
01:31:09,912 --> 01:31:11,347
Time for the song and dance.

1249
01:31:11,914 --> 01:31:12,648
What's that smell?

1250
01:31:13,082 --> 01:31:14,783
Alice thinks it's bad luck
to change her socks.

1251
01:31:15,484 --> 01:31:17,185
So we all suffer?
Get away, get away.

1252
01:31:17,853 --> 01:31:21,623
Outfielders, play deep a few steps.
Don't give up anything long. Alice?

1253
01:31:22,857 --> 01:31:26,060
If the lead-off hitter gets on,
they're gonna bunt. Be ready.

1254
01:31:27,595 --> 01:31:29,630
Now, I'd like to...

1255
01:31:32,900 --> 01:31:34,534
I'd like to lead you in prayer.

1256
01:31:35,168 --> 01:31:35,969
- Come on.
- A prayer?

1257
01:31:36,736 --> 01:31:37,737
Come on.

1258
01:31:39,772 --> 01:31:41,874
Yes, a little prayer.
Come on! Come on!

1259
01:31:43,009 --> 01:31:44,844
In the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Ghost...

1260
01:31:49,782 --> 01:31:50,883
Lord...

1261
01:31:52,184 --> 01:31:53,685
...hallowed be Thy name.

1262
01:31:56,354 --> 01:31:57,856
May our feet be swift.

1263
01:31:58,790 --> 01:32:00,358
May our bats be mighty.

1264
01:32:01,626 --> 01:32:03,260
May our balls...

1265
01:32:04,128 --> 01:32:05,129
...be plentiful.

1266
01:32:06,597 --> 01:32:07,598
And, Lord...

1267
01:32:08,098 --> 01:32:11,535
...I'd just like to thank you
for that waitress in South Bend.

1268
01:32:12,869 --> 01:32:15,205
You know who she is.
She kept calling Your name.

1269
01:32:16,406 --> 01:32:17,340
And, God...

1270
01:32:19,208 --> 01:32:21,310
...these are good girls,
and they work hard.

1271
01:32:23,112 --> 01:32:25,914
Help them see it all the way through.
Okay, that's it.

1272
01:32:26,915 --> 01:32:28,216
- Let's go.
- Amen.

1273
01:32:32,153 --> 01:32:33,221
Go...

1274
01:32:34,155 --> 01:32:35,223
...Peaches!

1275
01:32:38,392 --> 01:32:40,561
Last game. Now or never, ladies.

1276
01:32:45,599 --> 01:32:48,201
Alice, you're killing me.
You're killing me, Alice!

1277
01:32:49,236 --> 01:32:51,137
You're goddamn killing me!

1278
01:32:57,076 --> 01:32:59,678
And the rocket's red glare

1279
01:33:00,546 --> 01:33:03,081
The bombs bursting in air

1280
01:33:04,249 --> 01:33:06,651
Gave proof through the night

1281
01:33:07,786 --> 01:33:10,121
That our flag was still there

1282
01:33:11,556 --> 01:33:14,692
Oh, say does that star-spangled

1283
01:33:15,793 --> 01:33:18,262
Banner yet wave

1284
01:33:20,898 --> 01:33:24,401
O'er the land of the free

1285
01:33:25,635 --> 01:33:29,672
And the home of the brave

1286
01:33:34,343 --> 01:33:37,212
This is it, folks.
One game for the whole ball of string.

1287
01:33:38,247 --> 01:33:39,448
There is no tomorrow.

1288
01:33:39,948 --> 01:33:43,785
Someone will walk out league champions,
and someone else will just walk out.

1289
01:33:44,986 --> 01:33:46,554
You're gonna lose!

1290
01:33:47,488 --> 01:33:49,190
You're gonna lose!

1291
01:33:53,861 --> 01:33:56,130
You keep that kid away from me
for just one game!

1292
01:33:57,664 --> 01:33:58,966
Ellen Sue, how's it looking?

1293
01:33:59,499 --> 01:34:01,134
- Good.
- Feeling good? Looking good!

1294
01:34:01,768 --> 01:34:02,702
Nice and warm?

1295
01:34:03,136 --> 01:34:06,139
Good. Alice, if Ellen Sue doesn't have
anything, don't keep it a secret.

1296
01:34:07,173 --> 01:34:08,741
Tell me right away.

1297
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:10,476
You understand me?

1298
01:34:10,976 --> 01:34:12,144
Do you hear me?!

1299
01:34:12,778 --> 01:34:14,213
You're screaming. I hear you.

1300
01:34:17,482 --> 01:34:18,483
Where'd you come from?

1301
01:34:19,951 --> 01:34:21,786
We got to Yellowstone and turned back.

1302
01:34:25,590 --> 01:34:27,625
Have trouble with the bears, did you?

1303
01:34:28,459 --> 01:34:31,395
I was fine until that scout walked
into our barn. I'm no quitter.

1304
01:34:32,363 --> 01:34:34,831
Wait a minute! Hold it!
Who said you could play?

1305
01:34:39,002 --> 01:34:40,970
Alice has been catching
the last six games.

1306
01:34:43,373 --> 01:34:44,874
She looks pretty good.

1307
01:34:46,842 --> 01:34:47,977
You don't want me to play?

1308
01:34:48,944 --> 01:34:51,046
Well, you're already dressed.

1309
01:34:52,381 --> 01:34:54,516
Hell, if you want to play...

1310
01:34:55,951 --> 01:34:56,952
...I don't care.

1311
01:34:57,686 --> 01:34:58,953
You can play.

1312
01:35:00,388 --> 01:35:01,656
Well, then, I'll play.

1313
01:35:04,358 --> 01:35:05,159
Good.

1314
01:35:05,559 --> 01:35:07,127
- Fine.
- Fine. Go play.

1315
01:35:12,799 --> 01:35:14,834
You look like shit.
Don't you ever shave?

1316
01:35:19,572 --> 01:35:21,140
We're gonna win.

1317
01:35:22,575 --> 01:35:24,009
We're gonna win!

1318
01:35:26,312 --> 01:35:27,546
You're gonna lose!

1319
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:29,648
You stink!

1320
01:35:36,888 --> 01:35:37,989
Got him!

1321
01:35:39,490 --> 01:35:40,725
Lineup change!

1322
01:35:41,225 --> 01:35:43,260
- It's okay.
- Evelyn, he deserved it.

1323
01:35:44,828 --> 01:35:47,698
Stilwell, you gonna stay out here
or come in the dugout?

1324
01:35:52,469 --> 01:35:53,269
Strike!

1325
01:35:53,703 --> 01:35:54,370
Strike!

1326
01:36:01,977 --> 01:36:02,778
You're out!

1327
01:36:07,582 --> 01:36:08,517
3!

1328
01:36:10,085 --> 01:36:10,885
Strike!

1329
01:36:13,821 --> 01:36:14,555
You're out!

1330
01:36:14,922 --> 01:36:15,590
You're out!

1331
01:36:16,190 --> 01:36:18,025
You're out, Brenda! You are out!

1332
01:36:20,394 --> 01:36:21,762
Go! Go! Go!

1333
01:36:30,270 --> 01:36:32,472
Good, Mae! Good catch!
Thank goodness.

1334
01:36:34,574 --> 01:36:36,075
2 down! 2 down!

1335
01:36:41,413 --> 01:36:43,315
Base hit. Gardner's up with it.

1336
01:36:44,049 --> 01:36:45,817
Wallace'll stop at 3rd.

1337
01:36:46,451 --> 01:36:47,819
Gardner's throw is way off line!

1338
01:36:51,589 --> 01:36:53,557
Go! Go! All the way!

1339
01:36:54,258 --> 01:36:55,759
I'm sorry! Shoot!

1340
01:36:56,393 --> 01:37:00,230
Wallace scampers home, and the Belles
take the lead, 1 to nothing!

1341
01:37:01,431 --> 01:37:03,533
They're dancing in the aisles
here in Racine!

1342
01:37:24,853 --> 01:37:26,421
I know. I know.

1343
01:37:33,260 --> 01:37:34,895
You're still missing the cutoff man.

1344
01:37:35,529 --> 01:37:37,798
That's something I would like
you to work on...

1345
01:37:38,598 --> 01:37:39,833
...before next season.

1346
01:37:46,472 --> 01:37:47,974
All right. Thanks.

1347
01:37:49,575 --> 01:37:51,277
Thank you, Mr. Dugan.

1348
01:38:02,787 --> 01:38:04,422
All right, let's get this one!

1349
01:38:07,091 --> 01:38:09,693
All right, come on!
We need some runs out there.

1350
01:38:10,561 --> 01:38:12,129
Make something happen, Mae!

1351
01:38:13,497 --> 01:38:15,065
All-the-Way Mae!

1352
01:38:15,966 --> 01:38:18,768
- They love her.
- Let's go, let's go!

1353
01:38:21,504 --> 01:38:22,672
Very cute. Thanks.

1354
01:38:34,449 --> 01:38:35,183
Safe!

1355
01:38:35,617 --> 01:38:36,551
She's safe!

1356
01:38:38,786 --> 01:38:41,522
Way to play! Way to run!
Way to make something happen!

1357
01:38:46,393 --> 01:38:47,061
Safe!

1358
01:38:57,970 --> 01:39:00,906
You get a hit, I'll baby-sit
that little porker! Come on!

1359
01:39:07,980 --> 01:39:08,647
You're out!

1360
01:39:13,785 --> 01:39:15,687
Come on! Bring me home, Helen!

1361
01:39:26,096 --> 01:39:27,030
Out!

1362
01:39:30,266 --> 01:39:31,901
Peaches are down to their final out.

1363
01:39:32,802 --> 01:39:35,605
Only tying and go-ahead runs
in scoring position.

1364
01:39:36,539 --> 01:39:38,574
Big Dottie Hinson striding
to the plate.

1365
01:39:39,341 --> 01:39:42,010
Let's get out of this inning!
Come on!

1366
01:39:58,025 --> 01:39:59,727
Throw smoke, Kit! Throw smoke!

1367
01:40:08,268 --> 01:40:09,435
Here's the pitch.

1368
01:40:12,104 --> 01:40:14,240
Bite me on the butt
and call me an apple!

1369
01:40:14,974 --> 01:40:16,408
She nearly took her head off!

1370
01:40:17,309 --> 01:40:18,811
Mordabito scores!

1371
01:40:23,148 --> 01:40:24,516
Murphy, she will score!

1372
01:40:25,150 --> 01:40:27,352
Rockford has taken the lead, 2 to 1!

1373
01:40:31,355 --> 01:40:32,356
That's my wife!

1374
01:40:47,036 --> 01:40:48,271
One more!

1375
01:40:49,205 --> 01:40:50,706
Keep it going!

1376
01:40:54,543 --> 01:40:56,745
Put it past the little queen here.

1377
01:40:57,512 --> 01:40:58,747
Right past her!

1378
01:40:59,748 --> 01:41:01,383
There's a fly ball to left field.

1379
01:41:02,016 --> 01:41:03,918
She'll have to go for this one!

1380
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:07,154
That's the final out.

1381
01:41:07,755 --> 01:41:09,190
But the damage has been done.

1382
01:41:09,857 --> 01:41:12,726
Right here in Racine,
Rockford leads our Belles, 2 to 1...

1383
01:41:13,727 --> 01:41:15,762
...as we go to the bottom of the 9th.

1384
01:41:16,863 --> 01:41:19,265
Come on, it's okay.
You gotta bat now. Relax!

1385
01:41:21,034 --> 01:41:23,069
One run and we are back
in this ball game.

1386
01:41:23,836 --> 01:41:26,038
Shake it off. You gotta hit.

1387
01:41:32,311 --> 01:41:33,812
It's okay, Kit.

1388
01:41:41,753 --> 01:41:43,654
Strike her out!

1389
01:41:44,355 --> 01:41:46,257
Bad eye! Bat at that, blond girl!

1390
01:41:50,527 --> 01:41:52,229
She drives it to deep centre!

1391
01:41:52,929 --> 01:41:54,297
Mordabito goes to the wall...

1392
01:41:55,098 --> 01:41:57,066
...and makes the catch!

1393
01:41:58,701 --> 01:42:00,269
Beautiful catch!

1394
01:42:01,270 --> 01:42:02,371
Beautiful!

1395
01:42:03,773 --> 01:42:05,608
Gotlander's pitch...

1396
01:42:06,275 --> 01:42:08,644
...and it is in the dirt! Ball 1!

1397
01:42:11,780 --> 01:42:13,815
That looked good to me, Ellen Sue!

1398
01:42:14,616 --> 01:42:16,517
Shake that one off!

1399
01:42:17,218 --> 01:42:18,219
That ain't nothing!

1400
01:42:21,222 --> 01:42:23,424
Gotlander, she delivers.

1401
01:42:24,191 --> 01:42:26,326
It's a ground ball between 1 st and 2nd.

1402
01:42:27,094 --> 01:42:27,894
This ball is hot!

1403
01:42:28,362 --> 01:42:30,497
Hendricks will go up at 1 st
with a base hit.

1404
01:42:33,766 --> 01:42:36,369
That's all right. 1 down!
We got 1 down! Let's go!

1405
01:42:42,641 --> 01:42:44,543
Foul ball! Hinson's taking after it.

1406
01:42:45,244 --> 01:42:46,044
That does it!

1407
01:42:46,478 --> 01:42:47,546
Did she get it?

1408
01:42:48,613 --> 01:42:50,248
She got it! She got it!

1409
01:42:52,884 --> 01:42:55,086
There's no question who the star
of this game is.

1410
01:42:55,887 --> 01:42:59,123
Dottie Hinson has her team
1 out from the title.

1411
01:43:04,561 --> 01:43:07,430
Come on, Kit, you're up.
You're the hitter now. Let's go.

1412
01:43:14,303 --> 01:43:17,306
The last batter standing
in Rockford's way is Kit Keller.

1413
01:43:18,307 --> 01:43:20,142
Kit is 1 for 3 today.

1414
01:43:30,084 --> 01:43:31,853
- Can I have time-out?
- Time!

1415
01:43:44,664 --> 01:43:47,800
High fastballs. She can't hit them,
can't lay off them.

1416
01:43:48,835 --> 01:43:49,502
All right.

1417
01:43:50,136 --> 01:43:53,005
All right, if we just hold them now,
we got it! Come on!

1418
01:43:54,506 --> 01:43:55,641
Come on, Ellen Sue!

1419
01:43:56,141 --> 01:43:57,643
One, two, three!

1420
01:44:06,184 --> 01:44:06,984
Play ball!

1421
01:44:14,925 --> 01:44:16,293
- Strike!
- Swing and a miss.

1422
01:44:16,893 --> 01:44:17,961
Strike 1!

1423
01:44:18,428 --> 01:44:19,529
Yes! Thank you, God!

1424
01:44:20,063 --> 01:44:21,831
Lay off the high ones!

1425
01:44:31,507 --> 01:44:32,508
Here's the pitch.

1426
01:44:33,108 --> 01:44:34,810
Swing and a miss! Strike 2!

1427
01:44:40,181 --> 01:44:42,350
One more! One more!

1428
01:45:01,934 --> 01:45:03,236
Here's the pitch.

1429
01:45:04,537 --> 01:45:06,505
It is a long fly ball.
Back, back, back.

1430
01:45:09,274 --> 01:45:10,008
It falls in there!

1431
01:45:10,442 --> 01:45:11,877
No one'll get to this ball!

1432
01:45:12,611 --> 01:45:14,846
This should tie it up!
Hendricks is rounding 3rd!

1433
01:45:15,613 --> 01:45:16,548
She will...

1434
01:45:16,981 --> 01:45:17,715
...score!

1435
01:45:18,116 --> 01:45:18,983
Keller to 3rd!

1436
01:45:21,219 --> 01:45:23,754
Gardner hits the relay man
with a frozen rope!

1437
01:45:26,457 --> 01:45:29,893
The coach is giving Keller the stop sign
at 3rd! But she is not stopping!

1438
01:45:30,994 --> 01:45:32,262
She runs through the stop sign!

1439
01:45:32,796 --> 01:45:34,030
She is not stopping!

1440
01:45:34,564 --> 01:45:35,932
Here comes the throw!

1441
01:45:36,499 --> 01:45:37,600
It should be in time!

1442
01:45:50,378 --> 01:45:51,179
Safe!

1443
01:45:54,015 --> 01:45:55,917
She is safe! I can't believe it!

1444
01:45:56,717 --> 01:45:57,985
Hinson dropped the ball!

1445
01:45:58,552 --> 01:45:59,720
Hinson dropped the ball!

1446
01:46:00,788 --> 01:46:03,590
The ball game is over!
Racine has won the game, 3 to 2...

1447
01:46:04,491 --> 01:46:06,059
...and the World Series!

1448
01:46:07,194 --> 01:46:09,596
Take me home, Mama, and put me to bed!

1449
01:46:10,497 --> 01:46:13,800
I have seen enough to know
I have seen too much!

1450
01:46:51,033 --> 01:46:52,535
You played a good game.

1451
01:47:04,279 --> 01:47:05,580
Well, what do you say?

1452
01:47:06,948 --> 01:47:08,116
All right, Ira.

1453
01:47:08,683 --> 01:47:10,051
We'll stick with it.

1454
01:47:10,985 --> 01:47:13,787
My mother always used to say,
"If at first you don't succeed-"

1455
01:47:14,688 --> 01:47:17,090
You don't have to spend
six months in Saskatchewan.

1456
01:47:17,925 --> 01:47:20,994
- Alice, you told me it's lovely.
- If you like icicles.

1457
01:47:22,028 --> 01:47:23,596
I thought we were gonna win.

1458
01:47:24,264 --> 01:47:26,532
- We didn't.
- Up to that last inning, we had it.

1459
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:29,969
I'm so depressed, I could eat a cow.

1460
01:47:31,837 --> 01:47:33,272
It's all right.

1461
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:36,441
You did good.

1462
01:47:38,710 --> 01:47:40,478
Get dressed. See you on the bus.

1463
01:47:42,447 --> 01:47:43,381
Thanks.

1464
01:47:49,887 --> 01:47:51,722
Wanna be a ballplayer
when you get big?

1465
01:47:53,023 --> 01:47:54,858
- What's your name?
- Angelina.

1466
01:48:01,764 --> 01:48:03,266
Gotta practice really hard.

1467
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:05,268
What's your name?

1468
01:48:05,735 --> 01:48:07,169
- How much?
- Help yourself.

1469
01:48:07,770 --> 01:48:08,637
Thank you.

1470
01:48:09,138 --> 01:48:11,039
- Hitting!
- You all like hitting better?

1471
01:48:11,807 --> 01:48:13,241
- What's your name?
- Mary.

1472
01:48:16,144 --> 01:48:17,645
- Who you rooting for?
- Racine!

1473
01:48:18,313 --> 01:48:20,081
That's what I thought you said.

1474
01:48:22,116 --> 01:48:24,151
You guys be good. Get dirty.

1475
01:48:37,730 --> 01:48:39,999
- I'm sorry I knocked you over.
- No, you're not.

1476
01:48:41,100 --> 01:48:43,002
You blocked the entire plate!
How do you-

1477
01:48:43,769 --> 01:48:45,404
You did what you had to.

1478
01:48:46,071 --> 01:48:47,773
You beat me.
You wanted it more than me.

1479
01:48:49,107 --> 01:48:51,576
I jammed my shoulder,
if it makes you feel any better.

1480
01:48:54,145 --> 01:48:55,079
A little.

1481
01:48:58,149 --> 01:49:01,419
Bob and I are driving back to Oregon.
You're welcome to come with us.

1482
01:49:04,421 --> 01:49:05,722
You two should be alone.

1483
01:49:06,256 --> 01:49:07,624
I'd just be in the way.

1484
01:49:08,225 --> 01:49:09,793
When will you be coming home?

1485
01:49:11,795 --> 01:49:15,298
Some of the girls talked about
staying around here and getting jobs.

1486
01:49:16,999 --> 01:49:18,501
I really like it here.

1487
01:49:19,268 --> 01:49:20,202
Christmas?

1488
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:27,209
I don't know. You'll come back
next year, right?

1489
01:49:29,778 --> 01:49:31,613
I wanna have kids.
We wanna have kids.

1490
01:49:32,847 --> 01:49:35,049
You got plenty of time to have kids.

1491
01:49:36,484 --> 01:49:38,119
You couldn't give this up.
You'd miss it.

1492
01:49:38,819 --> 01:49:39,620
Miss it?

1493
01:49:40,087 --> 01:49:41,655
Miss putting on all this gear?

1494
01:49:42,256 --> 01:49:45,125
Catching a double-header in 100-degree
heat? Pushing the bus in mud?

1495
01:49:46,092 --> 01:49:48,695
Getting slammed into every other day
by a base runner?

1496
01:49:49,662 --> 01:49:51,097
Think I'm gonna miss that?

1497
01:49:54,667 --> 01:49:56,102
I'll tell you what I'll miss.

1498
01:49:58,537 --> 01:49:59,905
I'll miss the girls.

1499
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:02,240
I'll miss you.

1500
01:50:03,542 --> 01:50:04,476
Me?

1501
01:50:05,810 --> 01:50:07,579
How many sisters do you think I have?

1502
01:50:12,416 --> 01:50:13,551
I love you, Kit.

1503
01:50:15,486 --> 01:50:16,353
Really?

1504
01:50:18,789 --> 01:50:21,124
Just when I want you to stay,
you're leaving.

1505
01:50:29,966 --> 01:50:31,667
Thanks for getting me in the league.

1506
01:50:33,102 --> 01:50:35,971
You got yourself in the league.
I got you on the train.

1507
01:50:37,773 --> 01:50:38,640
Play great.

1508
01:50:40,141 --> 01:50:41,076
Like you.

1509
01:50:43,678 --> 01:50:44,545
You stay in touch.

1510
01:50:45,346 --> 01:50:46,914
Come home every once in a while.

1511
01:50:47,815 --> 01:50:50,751
If you don't, I'll come back
and hit line drives at your head.

1512
01:50:55,555 --> 01:50:56,823
I love you.

1513
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:01,995
And you are gonna miss this.

1514
01:51:02,962 --> 01:51:04,330
I don't care what you say.

1515
01:51:07,900 --> 01:51:08,834
There's the winner!

1516
01:51:09,301 --> 01:51:10,669
Good game, Jimmy.

1517
01:51:12,871 --> 01:51:15,607
Hi, I'm a big fan of yours.
I'm Dottie's husband.

1518
01:51:18,676 --> 01:51:20,979
Well, then I'm a big fan of yours.

1519
01:51:29,053 --> 01:51:30,420
Old man Harvey just...

1520
01:51:31,021 --> 01:51:33,290
...offered me a job managing
next year in Wichita.

1521
01:51:35,191 --> 01:51:36,893
Triple A? Great. Good luck.

1522
01:51:37,627 --> 01:51:38,561
Turned him down.

1523
01:51:39,295 --> 01:51:40,029
Why?

1524
01:51:40,496 --> 01:51:41,797
What do you mean, why?

1525
01:51:42,398 --> 01:51:43,632
I already got a job.

1526
01:51:48,537 --> 01:51:49,638
I'll see you.

1527
01:51:52,240 --> 01:51:54,976
Miss Cuthbert, save me
my special seat, now, cutie!

1528
01:51:55,910 --> 01:51:57,111
Meet you at the hotel.

1529
01:52:05,686 --> 01:52:07,054
Did you see Mae's catch, Dad?

1530
01:52:07,688 --> 01:52:10,290
I'd rather see you play ball
instead of what you used to do.

1531
01:52:11,558 --> 01:52:13,960
What are you saying that for?
You make her feel bad!

1532
01:52:14,827 --> 01:52:15,762
Steak dinner.

1533
01:52:16,229 --> 01:52:17,864
On you. I'll see you later.

1534
01:52:18,564 --> 01:52:20,666
Kit, over here! Come on, let's go!

1535
01:52:32,076 --> 01:52:33,311
That was Bob, huh?

1536
01:52:34,078 --> 01:52:35,179
Nice guy.

1537
01:52:44,021 --> 01:52:45,255
Lay off of those high ones.

1538
01:52:46,890 --> 01:52:47,991
I like the high ones.

1539
01:52:49,192 --> 01:52:50,493
- Mule!
- Nag!

1540
01:53:26,693 --> 01:53:28,261
Hey, Mae. Come here.

1541
01:53:29,562 --> 01:53:30,863
- What do you want?
- Come here.

1542
01:53:33,232 --> 01:53:34,466
- What is it?
- Look at her.

1543
01:53:41,139 --> 01:53:42,073
It's Dottie.

1544
01:53:44,375 --> 01:53:45,376
Hey, Doris.

1545
01:53:51,048 --> 01:53:52,616
Mae? All-the-Way Mae?

1546
01:53:53,250 --> 01:53:55,219
- No one's called me that since-
- Last night!

1547
01:53:55,953 --> 01:53:57,054
I'm a married woman now.

1548
01:53:57,587 --> 01:53:58,755
Yeah, about eight times.

1549
01:53:59,289 --> 01:54:01,558
Girls! Look who's here!

1550
01:54:02,325 --> 01:54:03,326
Shirley?

1551
01:54:07,763 --> 01:54:09,265
Helen Haley!

1552
01:54:09,932 --> 01:54:13,435
- It's Dr. Haley now. I'm a doctor.
- I always knew you would be.

1553
01:54:14,836 --> 01:54:16,204
- Who's that?
- Dottie Hinson.

1554
01:54:17,239 --> 01:54:18,540
Betty Spaghetti?

1555
01:54:19,307 --> 01:54:20,809
Best ballplayer in the league.

1556
01:54:21,409 --> 01:54:23,444
- I don't remember her.
- She only played one year.

1557
01:54:24,312 --> 01:54:25,813
Ellen Sue!

1558
01:54:28,482 --> 01:54:30,384
You haven't changed one bit.

1559
01:54:31,418 --> 01:54:33,553
I married a plastic surgeon.

1560
01:54:35,489 --> 01:54:37,190
Having you here is good luck.

1561
01:54:37,824 --> 01:54:39,125
Thanks, Alice!

1562
01:54:49,334 --> 01:54:50,269
Marla!

1563
01:54:54,573 --> 01:54:56,274
I'm so glad you're here.

1564
01:54:56,941 --> 01:54:59,344
- How's...?
- Nelson? He's good.

1565
01:55:00,178 --> 01:55:02,213
He's retired.
Our son runs the business.

1566
01:55:05,282 --> 01:55:06,083
How's Bob?

1567
01:55:07,851 --> 01:55:08,652
He's...

1568
01:55:10,821 --> 01:55:11,488
When?

1569
01:55:12,455 --> 01:55:13,757
Just this winter.

1570
01:55:15,692 --> 01:55:16,960
I'm sorry.

1571
01:55:22,331 --> 01:55:24,566
Oh, Shirley, I'm so excited.

1572
01:55:25,334 --> 01:55:26,835
I've got butterflies in my stomach!

1573
01:55:27,502 --> 01:55:30,739
They've got a "Women In Baseball"
thing up there. Isn't it neat?

1574
01:55:31,773 --> 01:55:34,108
Baseball Hall of Fame.
I'm shaking.

1575
01:55:34,976 --> 01:55:36,277
Wait a minute here.

1576
01:55:37,445 --> 01:55:39,280
- Guess who that is?
- Who?

1577
01:55:45,786 --> 01:55:46,520
You remember?

1578
01:55:47,521 --> 01:55:48,755
You're gonna lose.

1579
01:55:51,891 --> 01:55:52,892
Stilwell, angel!

1580
01:55:54,193 --> 01:55:55,061
My goodness!

1581
01:55:56,696 --> 01:55:57,697
Where's your mom?

1582
01:55:58,764 --> 01:56:00,799
Mom died a couple of years ago.

1583
01:56:02,334 --> 01:56:03,435
I'm sorry.

1584
01:56:03,936 --> 01:56:05,437
She was a real nice lady.

1585
01:56:06,371 --> 01:56:08,006
And a damn fine ballplayer.

1586
01:56:11,809 --> 01:56:13,644
When I heard about this, I...

1587
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:17,648
...felt like I...

1588
01:56:18,182 --> 01:56:19,550
...owed it to her to be here.

1589
01:56:20,150 --> 01:56:23,220
She always said it was the best time
she had in her whole life.

1590
01:56:27,123 --> 01:56:28,057
Come here.

1591
01:56:32,061 --> 01:56:33,696
Recognize yourself?

1592
01:56:37,132 --> 01:56:38,901
- Can I get one of these?
- Sure.

1593
01:57:04,190 --> 01:57:05,191
Ladies!

1594
