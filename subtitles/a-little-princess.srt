00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,020
A very long time ago...

3
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:28,340
...there lived a beautiful princess,
in a mystical land known as...

4
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,180
...India.

5
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,260
She was married to the
handsome Prince Rama...

6
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,660
...who had been banished
to the enchanted forest...

7
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,700
...by his jealous stepmother,
Queen Kaikeyi.

8
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,220
One day...

9
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,540
...Princess Sita saw a wounded deer
in the woods...

10
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,700
...and she begged Rama
to go and help it.

11
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,860
Rama drew a circle in the ground
and said to her:

12
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,140
''This is a magic circle.

13
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,860
So long as you stay inside it...

14
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,300
...no harm can come to you. ''

15
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,380
That night,
the princess heard a horrible cry.

16
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,700
Help me.

17
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,900
Thinking it was her beloved Rama
in danger...

18
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,780
...the princess ran from the circle
to answer the cry.

19
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,380
She soon came across
an old beggar man.

20
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,700
Although she had no money
to give him...

21
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,460
...she could not refuse his plea.

22
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,820
As soon as he had the bracelet...

23
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,180
...he transformed into the
1 0-headed demon, Ravana.

24
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,980
He grabs her and takes her
to his palace...

25
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,220
...to make her his bride.

26
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,300
Did you ever know
a real prince, Maya?

27
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,740
Laki's father.

28
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,860
- I thought he was in the army.
- He was.

29
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,220
And he was my prince.

30
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,700
And I, his princess.

31
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,420
But I mean real princes
and princesses.

32
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,900
All women are princesses.

33
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,500
It is our right.

34
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,340
I shall miss it here.

35
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,580
India is the only place on earth
that stirs the imagination.

36
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,860
I wish we could stay here forever.

37
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,620
I know, sweetheart.
But now that England's at war...

38
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,420
...I must go too.
You understand, don't you?

39
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,900
But why must I go to America?

40
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,540
Because it's safer.

41
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:43,140
And you'll be going to the school
your mother went to at your age...

42
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,820
- ...in a city called?
- New York.

43
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,460
Papa?

44
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:56,020
Maya told me that all girls
are princesses.

45
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,060
- Maya is a very wise woman.
- Then it's true?

46
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:03,260
You can be anything you want to be,
as long as you believe.

47
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,620
- What do you believe?
- I believe that you are...

48
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,580
...and always will be,
my little princess.

49
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,700
I gave this to your mother
on our wedding day.

50
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,860
I want you to have it.

51
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,380
She was so beautiful.

52
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,900
What did you love most about her?

53
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,780
Tough question.

54
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,420
I loved the way her eyes lit up
when she laughed.

55
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,100
Just like yours do.

56
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,260
I loved the sound of her voice when
she sang me the Indian folksong.

57
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,900
But I think,
more than anything else...

58
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,540
...I loved dancing with her!

59
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,300
Hello!

60
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,740
You must be Captain Crewe.

61
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,180
My sister will be down presently.

62
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,980
We were just preparing
the young lady's room.

63
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,060
Your things arrived this morning.

64
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,140
Thank you...?

65
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,420
Heavens, Amelia.
Amelia Minchin.

66
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,140
Captain Crewe.

67
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,740
How delightful to meet you!

68
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,620
And this must be little Sara.

69
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,300
My, what a beautiful child.

70
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:23,220
- I was telling the Captain--
- Thank you, that'll be all.

71
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,540
Won't you follow me?

72
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,220
Classes begin promptly at 8:00.

73
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,260
We cover all subjects:
literature, math, science...

74
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,620
...and of course, French and Latin.

75
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,620
Oh, Sara speaks fluent--

76
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,740
Luncheon is served at 1 :30.
Then we take our daily walk...

77
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,060
...unless the weather is
extremely inclement.

78
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,940
At 4:00, the girls attend
etiquette classes...

79
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,780
...where they're trained in
the formal graces of society.

80
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:55,140
Study hall is between 4:30 and 6:30,
followed by a light supper.

81
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,340
Before bedtime,
we read from one of the classics...

82
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,620
...something the children
look forward to with anticipation.

83
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,140
Sunday is a day of rest.
Students may write to their parents.

84
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,820
And of course, we attend church.
Have you any questions?

85
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,660
Come along, dear.

86
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,700
Girls.

87
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,420
Say hello
to our new arrival...

88
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,900
...Miss Sara Crewe.

89
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,940
Hello, Sara.

90
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,540
You must tell them about
your exciting life in India.

91
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,460
No doubt she'll be our most
popular student in no time.

92
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,140
There are certain rules
that should be made clear.

93
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,060
First is the Order Rule...

94
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,780
...which requires the girls keep
their rooms spotless.

95
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,660
These rules are strictly enforced.

96
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,540
But I assure you, the results
are well worth the effort.

97
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,700
Our reputation for sending
the most poised...

98
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,740
...and charming young ladies
into society...

99
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,900
...is one of the highest.

100
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,300
I've no doubt.

101
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:49,460
Also, I'm afraid jewelry
and such finery are not allowed.

102
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,540
What if I wear it in my room,
during my free time?

103
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,380
If you absolutely insist.

104
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,020
I do.

105
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,420
She'll get in trouble.

106
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,540
This is splendid.

107
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,420
It's our largest suite.

108
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,380
Thank you for all the care
you've taken.

109
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,220
I want Sara to feel at home
while I'm away.

110
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,460
- No expense shall be spared.
- Of course not.

111
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,380
I'll let you say goodbye.

112
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,660
You don't have much time
before your boat leaves.

113
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,340
We'll write to each other
every day.

114
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,220
How do you like your room?

115
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:09,380
I made sure it was the best,
with corner windows and a fireplace.

116
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,180
And with all your toys
and clothes moved in...

117
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,620
...it's as if you were really...

118
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,660
I think I saw something...

119
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,180
...on that chair over there.

120
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,620
She came all the way from France
to be with you.

121
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,380
Her name is Emily.

122
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,260
Dolls make the very
best friends.

123
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:48,420
Just because they can't speak
doesn't mean they don't listen.

124
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:53,180
Did you know, when we leave them alone
in our room, they come to life?

125
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,780
- They do?
- Yes.

126
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,180
Before we walk in, they quickly
return to their places.

127
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,340
Why don't they come to life
in front of us?

128
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,380
Because it's magic.

129
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,860
Magic has to be believed.

130
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,620
That's the only way it's real.

131
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,140
Whenever you're afraid,
or miss me terribly...

132
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,060
...just tell Emily.

133
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,420
She'll get the message to me,
wherever I am.

134
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,180
And I'll send one back right away...

135
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,460
...so when you hug her...

136
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,220
...you'll be getting a hug from me.

137
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,660
It's all right, Papa.

138
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,460
I'm going to be fine.

139
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,380
What are you doing?

140
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,780
Memorizing me by heart?

141
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,980
I already know you by heart.

142
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,020
Goodbye princess.

143
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:00,780
What was that noise last night?
Somebody was crying for hours.

144
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,380
That's nothing.
You should hear Josephine snore.

145
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,900
I do not!

146
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,100
Who was it? The new girl?

147
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,460
She hasn't come out of her room.
Did you see all her toys?

148
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,220
I want your hair ribbon.

149
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,620
Her father grows crackers.
They're very rich.

150
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,700
They must be.
Everyone I know eats crackers.

151
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:26,300
Her father's British. I hear he's
best friends with the king and queen.

152
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,540
I hear he was thrown out of India...

153
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,700
...because people died
from eating his poisoned crackers.

154
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,500
Poisoned crackers?

155
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,420
My aunt died from eating poisoned
string beans.

156
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:41,460
- Who cares about her?
- Yeah, who cares?

157
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:49,340
But before we catch them, they return
to their places, quick as lightning.

158
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,900
Gosh, she's fast.

159
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,020
Mama.

160
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,100
Sara?

161
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,140
We don't delay breakfast
for one student.

162
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,700
I'm sorry, but I--

163
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,060
Remember, you're not the only
child here.

164
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,100
Yes, good morning.

165
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,740
You remember our newest pupil
from our visit yesterday.

166
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,780
This is Monsieur Dufarge.

167
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,180
You begin French lessons today.

168
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,140
Do I have to?

169
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,260
You most certainly do.

170
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,300
Apologize to Monsieur
for your rudeness.

171
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,140
- But I didn't mean to be rude.
- Now!

172
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:01,740
This child doesn't need to learn French.
She practically is French!

173
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,260
She learned from her father.

174
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,620
I understood what she said.

175
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,900
I'm sorry. We tried to tell you.

176
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,540
She can tutor the younger children...

177
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:15,020
...and help you
with your pronunciation, Miss Minchin.

178
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,500
Are those sausages I smell?

179
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,620
Thank you.

180
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,580
There's no talking at the table.

181
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,980
Doesn't seem natural.

182
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,580
I won't say it again.

183
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,020
Seven times five is 35.

184
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,060
Seven times six is 42.

185
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,940
Seven times seven is 49.

186
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,740
Seven times eight is...

187
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,340
...58.

188
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,780
No, wait. 54?

189
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,100
55?

190
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,980
Or 72? Or 93? Or 1 2?

191
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,460
I'm sorry, Miss Minchin.

192
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,300
I studied for hours last night.

193
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,460
I find that hard to believe.

194
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,940
I imagine your father will as well.

195
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,260
Please don't tell him.

196
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,460
I promise I'll do better.

197
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,300
Please.

198
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,980
Lavinia, you may continue.

199
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,460
Seven times eight is 56.

200
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,620
Seven times nine...

201
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,780
...is 63.

202
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,500
Dear Papa:

203
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,380
I miss you already.

204
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,300
Things are fine.

205
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:57,420
Except I never imagined there
would be so many rules at school.

206
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,940
I guess they're there for a purpose...

207
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,300
...and I'm trying hard to obey them.

208
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,420
But I get the feeling
I'm doing something wrong.

209
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,660
Goodbye, Father.

210
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,700
Bye, son.

211
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,900
I hope when you read this...

212
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,860
...it kindles your heart and puts
a smile on your face.

213
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,420
I'm so proud of you.
I think about you every moment.

214
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,660
And I love you forever.

215
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,900
Your Sara.

216
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,460
Lottie, you mustn't get so excited.

217
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,220
Lottie? Precious?

218
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,380
Please, Lottie dear!
Please stop screaming!

219
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:20,460
How about a cookie?
Would you like that?

220
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,460
I'll get a cookie.

221
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,500
It's hard to study with you
carrying on like this.

222
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,820
I want my mama!

223
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,340
You'll see her soon.

224
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:41,060
I won't. She's dead,
and I won't ever see her again!

225
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,460
I don't have a mother either.

226
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,700
You don't?

227
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,340
Where is she?

228
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,340
In heaven with my baby sister.

229
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,100
That doesn't mean
I can't talk to her.

230
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,780
I tell her everything,
and I know she hears me.

231
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,380
How?

232
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,180
Because that's what angels do.

233
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,220
- Your mama's an angel?
- Of course.

234
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,220
And so is yours.
With beautiful wings of silk...

235
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,420
...and a crown of rosebuds.

236
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,260
And they all live together
in a castle.

237
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,540
Do you know what it's made of?

238
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,060
Sunflowers...

239
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:25,700
...hundreds of them, so bright
they shine like gold.

240
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,860
When the angels
want to go someplace...

241
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,540
...they just whistle, like this.

242
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:42,060
And a cloud floats to the castle
and picks them up.

243
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,540
As the angels fly through the sky...

244
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,940
...riding the cloud
like a magic carpet...

245
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,020
...under the moon
and through the stars...

246
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,700
...until they're hovering
above us.

247
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:04,020
That's how they can look down
and see if we're all right.

248
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,580
And sometimes they even
send messages to us.

249
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:16,340
You can't hear them if you're
kicking and screaming as you were.

250
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:22,060
But they always try again,
in case we've missed it.

251
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,020
Hey, wait!

252
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,460
That's Becky.
She's not allowed to talk to us.

253
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,820
Why not?

254
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:35,260
She's a servant girl,
and she has dark skin.

255
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,980
So?

256
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:40,220
Well, doesn't that mean something?

257
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,580
I'm sorry, I--

258
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,940
Is there anything
I can do for you, miss?

259
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,980
I just came up here
to change my shoes.

260
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,700
No, there's nothing.

261
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,900
Begging your pardon, but we'll
both be in trouble if you stay.

262
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,500
All right, girls, pair up.

263
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,220
Pair up.

264
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,780
''Sir Edward saw the sorrow
in his daughter's eyes...

265
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:44,100
...but he knew
that family honor must prevail.

266
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,700
Nobility was not to be trifled with.

267
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,500
'I beg of you, Charlotte,' he said.

268
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,260
'Marry Sir John in the spring,
as he has asked.' ''

269
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,020
Thank you, Lavinia.

270
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,340
Sara, you may take your turn.

271
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:11,020
''Charlotte said to her father,
'Father, you are right.

272
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,620
I must put away my foolish fancies
and childhood wishes.' ''

273
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,340
But I simply won't do it.

274
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,980
I'm sorry, Father.

275
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,940
When I marry, it'll be for love.

276
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:33,460
And with that,
Charlotte ran from the house.

277
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,420
Waiting outside was
the handsome stable boy, Pierre...

278
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,300
...whom Charlotte secretly adored.

279
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:43,340
Together they escaped to the coast
and quickly set sail for Tahiti.

280
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:48,140
When they were halfway there,
their ship was attacked by pirates!

281
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,540
Rather than be eaten alive...

282
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,500
...they threw
themselves into the sea.

283
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,260
As they began to drown...

284
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,380
...they held each other close,
and swore undying love.

285
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:05,180
Then, when all seemed lost,
a group of mermaids appeared--

286
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,500
Stop!

287
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,700
What are you doing?

288
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:17,700
I couldn't bear to see her marry him,
so I imagined another ending.

289
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,980
lmagined it?

290
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,460
Don't you ever do that, miss?

291
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,860
Believe in something,
just to make it seem real?

292
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,420
That's easy for a child
who has everything.

293
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:35,500
There will be no more make-believe
at this school...

294
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,540
...during reading
or any other time.

295
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,740
- Is that understood?
- Yes, Miss Minchin.

296
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,980
All of you, go to your bed.

297
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,500
I never heard a story like that
in my life.

298
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:54,300
I bet you know lots of them,
don't you, Sara?

299
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,380
I want silence up there!

300
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:02,180
We have to do something about this
communication rule.

301
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,340
After Minchin goes to bed...

302
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,380
...we'll sneak into your room, and you
can show us a real story.

303
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,100
How about it, Sara?

304
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,380
Only if it's just you three.

305
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,940
Come on, come on.

306
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,820
The evil Ravana locked the princess
up in his tower.

307
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,140
There she stayed for many weeks...

308
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,700
...just staring out her window...

309
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,300
...missing her Prince Rama terribly.

310
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,500
Perfect.

311
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,460
You look just like Emily.

312
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:39,020
My father hates dolls.
And he hates coming here.

313
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,220
Says he doesn't belong.

314
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,460
Then why does he send you?

315
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:46,220
Because he wants me to belong.

316
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:20,060
My little girl. She spoke French!
She really spoke French.

317
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,100
Your mother and I
are very proud of you.

318
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,420
I caught you, Nellie!

319
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,020
Papa!

320
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,740
Randolph...John!

321
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,180
Rama approached the thorny palace...

322
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,980
...unaware that Ravana
was waiting for him.

323
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,460
That's it!
I can't take it anymore!

324
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,700
I don't care what you say
about Sara's stories.

325
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:19,380
They have to be more fun than
watching your hair being combed!

326
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:24,180
If anyone else feels the same way,
she should leave too.

327
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,100
But Ravana was not through yet.

328
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:45,940
He took a bow that could
hold, not one, but 1 0 arrows...

329
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,140
...each filled with poison.

330
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,460
The arrows sped through the air...

331
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,460
...heading straight for Rama.

332
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,260
The arrows hit the ground...

333
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:00,420
...and released their poison,
giant clouds of thick, yello w smoke.

334
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,180
- I want a big piece!
- Hush up, Lottie.

335
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:10,380
''Princess'' Sara will give
everyone a fair share.

336
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,300
Right, Princess?

337
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,100
I told her that's what you were.

338
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:18,380
Well, not just me.
All girls are princesses.

339
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:21,900
Even snotty, two-faced bullies
like you, Lavinia.

340
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,660
Here, Lavinia,
you get a big piece.

341
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,420
Yes, may I help you?

342
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,220
I'm Mr. Barrow.

343
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,420
Captain Crewe's solicitor.

344
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,900
Oh, yes, do come in.

345
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,580
- We're celebrating Sara's birthday.
- May I speak to you in private?

346
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,420
Yes, of course.
Right this way.

347
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:47,180
May I just say that Sara is quite
the favorite around here.

348
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:51,100
We went to great lengths to make
this a special day for her.

349
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:07,900
I'm afraid your check to us this month
will be rather large.

350
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:11,180
There will be no check,
Miss Minchin.

351
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,300
Excuse me?

352
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:06,940
The party is over! Everyone
go to their rooms, this instant!

353
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,100
But we--

354
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,260
Sara, you will stay behind.

355
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,860
I have something to tell you.

356
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,940
Move!

357
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:25,620
Amelia, go to Sara's room
and find a simple black dress.

358
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,140
If nothing is suitable, borrow one.

359
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,500
- But, sister--
- Do as I say.

360
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:43,220
Why would I need a black dress,
Miss Minchin?

361
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,780
I'm afraid I have some bad news, Sara.

362
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,380
Your father has...

363
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,140
Your father--

364
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:13,540
It's been discovered that
your father has died.

365
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,940
He was killed in battle
several weeks ago.

366
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,140
I'm sorry.

367
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:25,780
That's the situation, and
there's nothing we can do to change it.

368
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:32,180
The British government has seized
control of his company and assets...

369
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:35,700
...leaving you penniless,
without any money.

370
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:40,100
Since you've no relations,
this puts me in a terrible position.

371
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,100
What are you staring at?

372
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,540
Don't you understand
what I'm saying?

373
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,420
You are alone in the world...

374
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,940
...unless I decide to keep you here...

375
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,580
...out of charity.

376
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:11,860
Because of the expenses you've
incurred, all you own is mine...

377
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,780
...your clothes, your toys, everything.

378
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:19,220
It'll hardly make up for
the financial losses I've suffered.

379
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:22,420
From now on, you must earn
your room and board.

380
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:25,900
You'll move to the attic
and work as a servant.

381
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,860
If you fail to meet our standards...

382
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,100
...or if you don 't obey,
you'll be thrown out.

383
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:38,180
And the streets of this city
are not kind to homeless beggars.

384
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,380
Report to Mabel in the kitchen
promptly at 5 a.m.

385
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,260
You could be arrested
for taking this.

386
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:56,020
You're lucky I let you keep
that doll.

387
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,100
You may have the book.

388
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,380
But another incident like this...

389
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,780
...and I will call the authorities.

390
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,220
I expect you to remember,
Sara Crewe...

391
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,860
...you're not a princess any longer.

392
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,380
Papa.

393
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,420
Papa, please.

394
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,060
Sara, what happened?

395
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:26,300
You're to serve the girls
without conversation, understand?

396
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:30,220
Sara will be working here
as a servant from now on.

397
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:34,060
There will be no communication.
Is that clear?

398
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,460
Yes, Miss Minchin.

399
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,980
Seven times five is 35.

400
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,660
Seven times six is 42.

401
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,940
Let go!

402
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,380
Great God!

403
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,740
It can't be!

404
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,700
It's my son, John!

405
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,180
Dear God, no.

406
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,460
Not John.

407
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,540
It's John, Ram Dass!

408
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,820
It's John. Help me.

409
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,380
- Come inside.
- Help.

410
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,860
I thought you'd be sleeping.

411
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,100
I never got a chance
to give you your birthday present.

412
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,580
It's a picture of where you
used to live.

413
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:01,420
See the blue threads?
That's the river.

414
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:05,220
These are the mountains
you always talk about.

415
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,700
Thank you, Becky.

416
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:09,860
It's beautiful.

417
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:16,860
Why don't you tell stories anymore?

418
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:21,420
They're just make-believe.
They don't mean anything.

419
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,380
They've always meant something to me.

420
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:29,140
Some days I thought I'd die, until
I heard you talk about the magic.

421
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,140
There is no magic, Becky.

422
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,220
Papa...

423
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,540
...can you hear me?

424
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,900
I'm so scared.

425
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:41,100
Are you still a princess?

426
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:45,660
You better get back in line
or we'll both be in trouble.

427
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:46,740
Are you?

428
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:51,820
Girls, get in line.

429
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:18,100
Don't touch that!

430
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,020
It's for Mr. Randolph.

431
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:24,180
The poor man. His son is
missing in action in Europe.

432
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:27,340
You mean John?
He's such a nice boy.

433
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,340
Here, little girl.

434
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:44,460
I told you
not to give your money away.

435
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:50,540
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

436
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:53,260
You see?
You never get rid of them.

437
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:59,620
May I help you?

438
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:05,700
Would you like to buy a flower?

439
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,900
Would you like to buy a flower?

440
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:10,820
- Would you?
- Not today.

441
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:15,220
Would you like to buy a flower?

442
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:26,260
Would you?

443
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:38,940
Pardon me.

444
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:47,980
Give her a flower.

445
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:49,700
Wait!

446
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,180
For the princess.

447
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,500
What is it, little mouse?

448
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:36,940
Are you a prisoner too?

449
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:43,860
Is it ever this cold
where you come from?

450
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:45,780
No.

451
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:51,340
Tell me about it, Sara.
Tell me again about India.

452
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,180
India.

453
00:48:58,580 --> 00:48:59,860
Tell me.

454
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:01,860
Well...

455
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:05,100
...the air is so hot there...

456
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:08,660
...you can almost taste it.

457
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,460
I bet it tastes like coconuts.

458
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:16,300
It's more like spices, really.

459
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:18,860
Curry and saffron.

460
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:20,780
What else?

461
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:28,020
Tigers sleep under trees...

462
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:32,220
...and elephants cool themselves
in the lakes.

463
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:35,900
The warm wind blows
through the fields...

464
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:38,660
...and the spirits ride it...

465
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:41,740
...singing as they look down on us.

466
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:45,580
Their voices echo
through the mountains...

467
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:47,740
...and the sky...

468
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:49,860
...is all different colors...

469
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:53,340
...like a peacock's tail.

470
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,940
Soot all over the place,
you clumsy fool!

471
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:58,060
Get out!

472
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:59,980
Get out of my house!

473
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:03,140
And you can forget
being paid this week!

474
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:05,180
Ungrateful little wretch.

475
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,060
No, you don't!

476
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:10,180
I won't tolerate
any soot in this house!

477
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:14,220
There, just look at my boot!
It's filthy!

478
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:16,180
Out!

479
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:20,220
Out! And take this
ridiculous-looking thing with you!

480
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:26,900
Where might Miss Amelia be
this morning?

481
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:30,420
Good morning, Frances.
You're here early this morning.

482
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:34,900
A working man gets up early if he
wants to have an effect on the world.

483
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:36,300
How true.

484
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:39,620
And what a powerful effect you have,
Frances.

485
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:20,260
Where have you been?

486
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:24,580
I've been chilled for half an hour.
Hurry up and light a fire.

487
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:28,060
And don't touch anything
else with your dirty hands.

488
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:32,220
This is my room now,
and I won't have you messing it up.

489
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:41,420
What is that awful smell?
When did you last have a bath?

490
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:50,380
What are you doing?

491
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:52,700
I don't believe in this!

492
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:56,740
So you can just stop it!
Stop it, I said!

493
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:02,940
What did you just do?

494
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:05,820
Just a little curse I learned
from a witch in India.

495
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:07,260
Curse?

496
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:12,140
- What kind of curse?
- You'll see.

497
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:16,180
But I wouldn't brush my hair as much
if I were you.

498
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:31,100
It's all right.
I saved it especially for you.

499
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:34,060
Go on. Take it.

500
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:01,620
Is this where you live?

501
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:05,420
You shouldn't be here.
It's too dangerous.

502
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:10,180
Why don't you like me anymore?
Did I do something wrong?

503
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:12,140
No, of course not.

504
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:15,740
I didn't think you'd
want me for a friend...

505
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:19,100
...now that things are different.

506
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:22,860
I'm sure you could do fine without
me for a friend...

507
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:25,820
...but I couldn't get along
without you.

508
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:28,860
I'm sorry.
I should've known...

509
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:31,620
...you wouldn't be like the others.

510
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:34,620
- What's that?
- One knock means ''I'm here. ''

511
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:38,660
Two knocks means ''All is well. ''

512
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:41,780
Three means
''The coast is clear. ''

513
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:46,500
- ''The demon Minchinweed is asleep. ''
- It all sounds so adventurous!

514
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:49,260
Look, Becky. We have a visitor.

515
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,380
Hello, Becky.

516
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:55,100
Oh, Sara, I miss your stories so much.

517
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:59,500
Won't you tell us what happened
to Rama and the princess?

518
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:02,260
The smoke from Ravana 's arrows...

519
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,740
...finally began to lift.

520
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:07,500
Rama lay dead on the ground.

521
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:09,460
Oh, no!

522
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:12,420
But then
a wonderful thing happened.

523
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:18,060
The gazelle laid down next to Rama,
giving him his own life.

524
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:31,820
He's suffering from amnesia...

525
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:34,940
...one of the rare side effects
of poison gas.

526
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:37,340
His eyes will heal in time.

527
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:40,100
His memory...who can say?

528
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:41,820
He's not my son.

529
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:45,980
I'm sorry, Mr. Randolph.

530
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:48,580
He was in severe shock...

531
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:51,380
...with no coat, no identification.

532
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:55,060
Since your son was the only name
unaccounted for...

533
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:57,500
...they assumed this was John.

534
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:00,780
I am sorry.

535
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:12,860
All the hoping.
You must think me a fool.

536
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:16,300
Is it your wish to be wise, sahib?

537
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:18,060
I don't know.

538
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:22,420
I suppose a wise man
wouldn't have come here at all.

539
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:23,940
But if he had...

540
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:27,500
...he would have looked
closely upon the soldier's face.

541
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:30,980
What would he have seen?

542
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:35,020
Pain, sahib.
He needs to be cared for.

543
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:38,340
He's not my responsibility.

544
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:42,620
A wise man would remember
that this man was in John's regiment.

545
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:47,780
If his memory returns, he might
tell what happened to his son.

546
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:53,860
Perhaps sahib will learn
that John is in British hospital...

547
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:59,020
...wishing that a kind man would
take him home, away from his pain.

548
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:06,500
If the plumber comes,
show him the problem.

549
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:09,820
And don't babble with him.
He's paid by the hour.

550
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:13,300
And correct the Latin tests
by the time I get back.

551
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:14,740
Yes, sister.

552
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:21,980
Hello, Miss Minchin.

553
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:24,740
Goodbye, Miss Minchin.

554
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:52,460
Oh, no, not again!

555
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:59,020
Lottie, not again.

556
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:20,180
Let's find the locket.

557
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:23,500
All right...

558
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:26,540
...it's okay. It's all right.

559
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:57,300
Come quick!
I think Lottie's possessed.

560
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:28,300
I got it.

561
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:36,780
Will you please get that child
under control?

562
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:38,860
Don't worry. Everything's fine.

563
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:09,100
What is it?

564
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:13,900
I thought I saw a mouse.

565
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:34,460
Hello.

566
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:45,900
I swear, that child has
a pact with Satan to destroy me.

567
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:48,820
I'm not cut out for this job.
I have no patience.

568
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:51,980
And teaching!
All those facts to remember.

569
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:53,740
I don't like it at all.

570
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:56,300
You like Frances, don't you?

571
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:57,580
What?

572
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:00,780
Of course not. How dare you.

573
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:02,380
I think he likes you too.

574
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:05,500
You do?

575
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:07,500
Really?

576
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:10,540
I think you should run away
and get married.

577
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:12,980
It'd be terribly romantic.

578
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:16,180
What an extraordinary thing to say.

579
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:29,820
Well, anyway, my sister would be
furious if she found out.

580
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:32,180
You'd be long gone by then.

581
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:34,860
Living in some exotic paradise...

582
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:37,900
...with that dashing young milkman.

583
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:42,900
I'd better get to the market.

584
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:05,140
You're doing well, young man.

585
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:07,060
You're almost home.

586
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:12,100
You must trust my eyes, sahib.

587
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:40,460
What's going on?

588
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:41,900
It's a surprise.

589
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:49,660
- What are you doing here?
- We brought you something.

590
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:57,580
Princess Sara, we present you with
something we rescued.

591
01:04:58,260 --> 01:04:59,860
In a dangerous adventure.

592
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:03,020
- Our very own crusade.
- Risking all our lives.

593
01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:04,660
And mine too.

594
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:14,980
I don't know what to say.

595
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:21,540
You are the best friends
anyone could ever ask for.

596
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:26,020
It's all right.

597
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:29,100
It's just my little monkey friend,
Hanuman.

598
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:32,500
Where did he come from?

599
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:34,660
Right next door. Look.

600
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:37,740
He likes to visit me.

601
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:40,340
Can you really talk to him, Sara?

602
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:44,740
Hanuman, say hello to all my friends.

603
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:07,900
After Rama came back to life...

604
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:11,940
...he raced towards the monster's
palace to rescue Sita.

605
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:13,100
Suddenly...

606
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:15,500
...Ravana appeared!

607
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:32,820
I think we better save
the rest for later.

608
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:51,580
What's going on here?

609
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:54,380
It's not their fault.
I asked them to come.

610
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:56,140
You five go downstairs.

611
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:57,860
I'll deal with you later.

612
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:00,100
Becky...

613
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:04,140
...you'll remain locked in your room
tomorrow without meals.

614
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:05,340
Go!

615
01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:11,740
And you will perform her chores
in addition to your own...

616
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:14,420
...without breakfast, lunch or dinner.

617
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:16,100
It's time you learned...

618
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:19,980
...that real life has nothing to do
with your fantasy games.

619
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:22,740
It's a cruel,
nasty world out there...

620
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:25,580
...and it's our duty
to make the best of it.

621
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:30,740
Not to indulge in ridiculous dreams,
but to be productive and useful.

622
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:36,620
Do you understand what I'm saying?

623
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:40,540
Yes, ma'am.

624
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:44,020
Good.

625
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:49,100
But I don't believe in it.

626
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:55,060
Don't tell me you still
fancy yourself a princess.

627
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:58,420
Good God, child, look around you!

628
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:01,420
Or better yet, look in the mirror.

629
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:10,380
I am a princess.

630
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:12,180
All girls are.

631
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:15,140
Even if they live
in tiny old attics.

632
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:17,620
Even if they dress in rags.

633
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:21,780
Even if they aren't pretty
or smart or young.

634
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:25,700
They're still princesses.
All of us.

635
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:29,340
Didn't your father ever tell you that?

636
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:31,220
Didn't he?

637
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:37,740
If I find you up here
with the girls again...

638
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:40,500
...I'll throw you out
into the street!

639
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:14,180
What're we going to do?

640
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,820
A whole day with nothing to eat.

641
01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:20,020
Don't cry, Becky.

642
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:21,900
I'm scared.

643
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:25,540
If Minchin throws me out,
I've got no place to go.

644
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:28,140
That's not true.

645
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:33,060
I'm here with you. I've always
thought of us as sisters.

646
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:34,940
You have?

647
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:38,580
Let's make a promise
to always look out for each other.

648
01:09:38,860 --> 01:09:39,900
It's a promise.

649
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:45,740
Now, what are we going to do
about food?

650
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:48,220
Starve, I guess.

651
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:51,500
No, there's only one thing to do.

652
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:54,700
We'll eat a great feast
before we go to sleep...

653
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:57,140
...and that will
keep us full tomorrow.

654
01:09:57,340 --> 01:10:00,060
Feast? What feast?

655
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:02,100
Just look around.

656
01:10:03,260 --> 01:10:04,980
See that table there?

657
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:07,700
It's covered with a beautiful cloth...

658
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:09,140
...and candles...

659
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:12,100
...and trays
of good things to eat.

660
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:15,060
Come on, Becky.

661
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:18,300
Tell me what kind of food there is.

662
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:21,260
But I don't see any food.

663
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,140
Try, Becky.

664
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:26,940
Just make-believe it.
Remember what you told me?

665
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:28,820
About the magic?

666
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:40,780
- Muffins?
- Good! What kind?

667
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:42,540
All kinds.

668
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:47,180
Every kind of muffin God ever made,
and all of them hot.

669
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:48,820
Good!

670
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:54,500
But we're not dressed right
for such an elegant banquet.

671
01:10:56,900 --> 01:11:01,340
I'm wearing a long velvet cape
with fur on the collar.

672
01:11:01,780 --> 01:11:02,620
And you?

673
01:11:02,860 --> 01:11:05,860
Well,
I always liked diamonds myself.

674
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:10,460
Rings and bracelets,
and a whole dress covered with them.

675
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:14,660
Smell those sausages!

676
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:16,540
I love sausages.

677
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:45,820
Oh, my Lord!

678
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:50,940
I think you went
a little too far this time.

679
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:52,620
It wasn't me.

680
01:12:57,220 --> 01:12:58,660
Go ahead.

681
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:14,620
I feel like I've been
touched by an angel.

682
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:15,780
Look!

683
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:17,500
Just what we ordered.

684
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:20,260
I'm a little scared about this.

685
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:23,580
Me too.
Do you think we shouldn't eat it?

686
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:25,220
I'm not that scared.

687
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:41,420
Thank you for your kindness.
I'm sorry to inconvenience you.

688
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:42,940
It is nothing, sahib.

689
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:49,700
That word...

690
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:53,460
It sounds so familiar...

691
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:57,020
...yet I don't know what it means.

692
01:13:57,260 --> 01:14:00,700
It is not English.
We use it where I am from.

693
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:02,780
In India.

694
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:06,460
India...

695
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:08,100
You know it?

696
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:12,260
No.

697
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:15,420
Everything's just a blur.

698
01:14:18,740 --> 01:14:20,860
Maybe someday I'll sort it out.

699
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:23,220
You will, sahib.

700
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:26,020
You will.

701
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:21,820
Yoo-hoo?

702
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:41,020
One minute.

703
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:06,700
Oh, my God.

704
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:21,300
Where is it?

705
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:23,020
Where's the locket?

706
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:24,940
Give it to me!

707
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:29,620
What is all this?

708
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:31,980
Where'd it come from?

709
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:34,500
I don't know.
I just woke up and it was here.

710
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:37,420
You stole it,
like you stole this locket!

711
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:40,500
You're nothing but a dirty
little thief.

712
01:16:40,940 --> 01:16:45,180
It's my responsibility to protect
the children from animals like you.

713
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:48,940
You'll be leaving
with the police very shortly!

714
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:52,700
No, Miss Minchin!

715
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:54,780
I didn't do it.

716
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:57,140
Miss Minchin, please!

717
01:16:57,380 --> 01:16:59,820
Miss Minchin, I didn't do it!

718
01:17:13,740 --> 01:17:17,060
You heard me.
I want her picked up immediately!

719
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:37,220
You've removed the bandages.

720
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:40,380
There wasn't much point.
I can see all right.

721
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:43,420
Come on in, have a brandy.

722
01:17:57,420 --> 01:17:58,980
Don't worry.

723
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:01,940
I'm sure they'll believe you.

724
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:05,420
I have to get out.

725
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:08,980
But how? My room's locked too.

726
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:23,220
The police, they're here!

727
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:28,180
Let's go, boys.
Step lively now.

728
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:44,340
Quick, help me with this board!

729
01:18:44,580 --> 01:18:46,780
- Right this way.
- Yes, madam.

730
01:19:00,980 --> 01:19:02,460
You'll fall!

731
01:19:03,620 --> 01:19:05,100
I can do it.

732
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:08,900
I'll come back for you.
I promise.

733
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:36,860
What is she doing?

734
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:39,060
Get back in here!

735
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:09,500
- The little beast is running away!
- We're trying, miss.

736
01:20:27,860 --> 01:20:28,780
Good God!

737
01:20:47,620 --> 01:20:50,540
Don't just stand there!
Go and find her!

738
01:20:56,140 --> 01:20:58,340
Take this one while you're at it.

739
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:16,380
I heard you calling
in your sleep last night.

740
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:20,700
Sometimes when I dream,
I sense a part of me that's missing.

741
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:24,980
It's strange, having your heart
remember what your mind can't.

742
01:21:28,540 --> 01:21:30,340
She jumped like a little animal.

743
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:35,460
Who's that at this hour?

744
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:42,020
Let us in, man.

745
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:45,460
A child from the school
is in your house.

746
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:46,820
What's going on?

747
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:49,620
I'm sorry, but there's a child
hiding in your house.

748
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:51,420
- What?
- Search upstairs.

749
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:56,420
Oh, not now!

750
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:58,500
Ram Dass, get some candles!

751
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:04,820
- Start with the attic.
- Let's go.

752
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:06,020
Quickly!

753
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:09,380
Who's there?

754
01:22:25,180 --> 01:22:28,740
Make sure you check the closets
and under the beds!

755
01:22:34,660 --> 01:22:35,900
What is it?

756
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:37,900
Why are you crying?

757
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:45,140
Please tell me.
I won't hurt you.

758
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:48,700
Won't you tell me your name?

759
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:03,420
That's such a pretty name.

760
01:23:18,220 --> 01:23:19,420
Papa.

761
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:28,100
Papa.

762
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:29,900
What did you say?

763
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:34,220
- I'm sorry.
- Papa, it's me, Sara.

764
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:35,620
Do you know me?

765
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:37,180
Don't you remember me?

766
01:23:37,620 --> 01:23:38,620
Please...

767
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:41,740
...you've got to know me.
It's Sara. Remember?

768
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:44,100
Remember India and Maya?

769
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:45,660
Remember the Ramayana...

770
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:48,780
...and Emily?
The locket with Mama's picture?

771
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:51,220
Oh, Papa, please!

772
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:53,100
Papa, please!

773
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:54,460
Do you know this man?

774
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:55,580
Tell them!

775
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:01,940
This child has no father.
Take her away!

776
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:07,140
Papa!

777
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:09,340
I'm so sorry.

778
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:33,980
Sara!

779
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:45,500
Papa, don't ever leave me!

780
01:24:58,300 --> 01:24:59,980
- I missed you.
- I love you.

781
01:25:54,140 --> 01:25:57,380
Well, well, well.
I hardly recognized you.

782
01:25:58,020 --> 01:26:00,220
I'm glad you straightened
everything out.

783
01:26:00,420 --> 01:26:02,700
They released all my property.

784
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:05,180
I came to say goodbye...

785
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:08,500
...and to thank you
for everything you've done for us.

786
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:11,500
No more than you tried to do for my son.

787
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:15,980
- Take care, Mr. Randolph.
- And you too.

788
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:19,140
You must be glad
to be going home.

789
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:21,100
Thank you.

790
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:46,660
I have a surprise for you all.

791
01:26:50,980 --> 01:26:55,740
Whenever you think of me, tell Emily,
and she'll get the message to me.

792
01:26:56,140 --> 01:27:00,020
And when you hug her, you'll really
be getting a hug from me.

793
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:02,260
Then we'll hug her every day.

794
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:31,580
That's the first time
anyone's hugged Lavinia.

795
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:36,940
Bye, Becky.

796
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:39,020
Come on.

797
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:48,940
Yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming.

798
01:27:49,340 --> 01:27:52,660
Get over here.
I've been looking for you, Minchin.

799
01:27:52,860 --> 01:27:55,380
- Pick up the bucket.
- When do I get my break?

800
01:27:55,580 --> 01:27:56,860
Follow me!

801
01:27:57,700 --> 01:27:59,980
What do you put in here, rocks?

802
01:28:07,740 --> 01:28:08,500
Bye, Ram Dass!

803
01:28:08,740 --> 01:28:11,100
- Bye, Hanuman!
- Cheerio!

804
01:28:12,305 --> 01:28:18,673
