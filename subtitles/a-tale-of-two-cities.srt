2
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,930
Get up. Get up. Come on.
Get up. Get up.

3
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,964
Get up there, get up there.

4
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,630
Come on there.
Now push hard.

5
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,673
Get up. Push hard. Come on.

6
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:26,277
Come on, there. Come on, there.

7
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,779
Blimey.

8
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,613
Hey, Joe, what o'clock is it?

9
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:36,880
It must be nearly 11.

10
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:39,616
Eleven, and we ain't atop
of Shooter's Hill yet?

11
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:42,283
- Push.
- Come on, now. Hey.

12
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:43,554
Come on.

13
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,479
Aye, Joe.

14
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,382
What do you say it is, Tom?

15
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,989
Well, I'd say it's a horse
coming up at a canter.

16
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:13,489
Well, I say it's a horse
coming up at a gallop.

17
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,925
Gentlemen, in the king's name,
on guard, all of you.

18
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:23,830
Dover mail?

19
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:25,493
Are you the Dover mail?

20
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,833
Never mind what we are. What are you?

21
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:30,032
I'm a messenger from Tellson's Bank.

22
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,474
Stand! No nearer.

23
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:34,704
I wants Mr. Jarvis Lorry.

24
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,815
I've got a message for him from his bank.

25
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:40,043
Here I am. Is that Jerry Cruncher?

26
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,881
Right you are, sir.

27
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,682
Stop! Keep where you are.

28
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:46,051
It's quite all right. I know him.

29
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:50,986
Then step over and speak to him if
you must, but don't let him come no nearer.

30
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,591
You never know these days.

31
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,860
What is the message, Jerry?

32
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:59,937
The message is to wait at
the Royal George for mademoiselle.

33
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,097
She'll be at Dover.

34
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:05,039
Give this reply to the office, Jerry:

35
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:07,304
"Recalled to life."

36
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,345
"Recalled to life."

37
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:11,483
Right you are, sir.

38
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,680
- Did you hear the message, sir?
- I did.

39
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:19,154
- What did you make of it?
- Nothing at all.

40
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:22,089
That's a coincidence too.
That's what I made of it myself.

41
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,857
Now then, gentlemen,
all together, please.

42
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:49,011
- Hot gravy, sir?
- No, no.

43
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,722
The young lady you were expecting, sir...

44
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,256
...Miss Manette...
- Yes.

45
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:55,394
- She has arrived, sir.
- Good.

46
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:57,859
It's business. Strictly business.

47
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,259
Of course, sir.

48
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:03,027
I'm from Tellson's Bank in London,
and it is business.

49
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,807
Quite, quite.

50
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:13,143
I am Mr. Jarvis Lorry Jr.
Of Tellson and Company, bankers.

51
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,372
Your humble servant, miss.

52
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:18,346
Yes, l... I received a letter
from the bank, sir...

53
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:21,282
...informing me that some intelligence,
some discovery...

54
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:24,082
The word is not material, miss,
either one will do.

55
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:28,523
- Are you quite a stranger to me, sir?
- Miss Manette, I am a man of business.

56
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:31,095
Pay no more attention to me
than if I were a machine.

57
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:34,199
- I am not much else.
- But I know you. I'm sure I know you.

58
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,062
Yes. When you were a little girl...

59
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:39,432
...I was instrumental in bringing you
and your mother over to England.

60
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:41,971
No romance. Business, you know.

61
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:45,338
- No room for sentiment in business.
- Yes.

62
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,274
That was 17 years ago.

63
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:51,440
Yes. I speak, miss, of that time.

64
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:56,111
Our business today has to do
with your father, Dr. Manette.

65
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,689
- You knew him before he died?
- Before...?

66
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:02,259
Yes. Yes, he was a client
of Tellson and Company's Paris bank.

67
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:03,690
I am an arm of that bank.

68
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,421
That is how you will regard me.

69
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:07,896
A mere mechanical arm
of Tellson and Company.

70
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:11,230
Mr. Lorry, what have you
come to tell me?

71
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:15,300
Now, let us suppose
that your father had not died.

72
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:18,137
- Suppose...
- Don't be afraid, child.

73
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:21,474
Mr. Lorry, please do not
keep me in suspense.

74
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:22,875
What is it?

75
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,517
If your father had not died.

76
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:28,745
If he had suddenly
and silently disappeared.

77
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:32,584
If he had an enemy
who caused him to be imprisoned...

78
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,922
I entreat you, sir.
Pray... Pray, tell me.

79
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:38,325
No, no. Don't kneel, child.

80
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,523
In heaven's name,
why should you kneel to me?

81
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,191
For the truth,
oh, dear, good, compassionate, sir.

82
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,269
For the truth.

83
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:49,033
Mr. Lorry, is my father alive?

84
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,744
Yes, child.

85
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:58,980
- Where is he?
- You will find him greatly changed.

86
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:02,918
A wreck it is probable,
though we will hope for the best.

87
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,953
My father.

88
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:08,719
My poor, poor father.

89
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,591
Now you know the best and the worst.

90
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,255
You will see this poor,
wronged gentleman...

91
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:18,928
...then with a fair sea voyage,
and a fair land voyage...

92
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,232
What is the matter?

93
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:23,637
Miss Manette, my dear child.

94
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,210
What are you doing to my Ladybird?

95
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,380
I was just... l... l...

96
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,175
I had to tell her some news.

97
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,146
You took a fine manner of doing it.

98
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:35,810
You in brown, why couldn't you tell her
without frightening her to death?

99
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:37,455
See what you've done to her.

100
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:38,954
You call that being a banker?

101
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,593
- I tried to break it as gently as I could.
- Gently?

102
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,161
I'd like to see you break things roughly.

103
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:48,556
Oh, my pretty. My sweet.

104
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:50,361
Pross is with you now.

105
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:52,367
No one can harm you.

106
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:53,835
My darling.

107
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:57,271
- I assure you, madam, I had no intention...
- I am not "madam."

108
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:59,775
I'm Miss Lucie's companion,
and I'm Miss Pross.

109
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,504
But, madam, I assure you that...

110
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,740
- I'm all right.
- Of course you're all right.

111
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,281
It was a shock.

112
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:08,511
The man has no sense blurting out
whatever he was blurting out...

113
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:10,747
...as if he were calling coals.

114
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:13,687
Please, Miss Pross.
Where is my father?

115
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,260
He has been imprisoned
at the Bastille 18 years.

116
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,056
Eighteen years.

117
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,358
Gracious creator of day.

118
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,297
To be buried alive for 18 years.

119
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:25,801
But I entreat you, sir, where is he now?

120
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,497
An old servant of his, De Farge,
is taking care of him.

121
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,507
- But where? Where?
- In his wine shop in Paris.

122
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,168
You must take me to him at once.

123
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,781
Well, why do you stand there
like a nincompoop?

124
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:39,850
You hear, don't you?
She wants to be taken to her father.

125
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,351
Isn't it natural she should
want to see her father?

126
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,750
Well, I will, but...

127
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,585
A toast to the king's health.

128
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,895
- There's mud in it.
- There's food in it.

129
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,126
Drink, little one.
Never mind the taste.

130
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,271
How can men bear such poverty?

131
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:36,238
Bear it? Look, they live within
the very shadow of the Bastille.

132
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,434
They have to bear it.

133
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,488
Don't do that, Jacques.

134
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:52,852
Well, there'll be blood flowing
in these streets before long, De Farge.

135
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,619
Yes, but keep that thought
in your heart, Jacques.

136
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,990
Don't waste it on the walls.

137
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,098
You're right, Jacques.

138
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:05,827
Jacques, where do you want this wood?
In the loft?

139
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,166
Jacques, 116 from Bordeaux.

140
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:11,367
Welcome, Jacques. Come inside.

141
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:17,809
A hundred and sixteen from Bordeaux,
my wife.

142
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:22,479
Well, Jacques, do you see the way
the spilt wine is being sucked up?

143
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:23,883
Every drop.

144
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:26,456
Not often those poor beasts
know the taste of wine...

145
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,617
...or of anything
but black bread and death.

146
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,785
It is so throughout all France.

147
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,897
Has he seen our tenant upstairs?

148
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,726
Not yet, but I'll show him.

149
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:39,029
Eighteen years imprisoned in the Bastille.

150
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,036
Wait till you see him.

151
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:45,769
The sight will burn into the souls
of all of the name of Jacques.

152
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,981
Strangers. The rose.

153
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,396
Madame De Farge?

154
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:15,434
Recalled to life.

155
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:20,612
Yes, yes. We have some
very fine old wine upstairs.

156
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,577
My husband will show you.

157
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:24,238
Come.

158
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:34,890
You were too young to remember me.

159
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:36,528
I was his servant.

160
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,391
Where...? Where is he?

161
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:40,293
Is he greatly changed?

162
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,696
Changed, mademoiselle.

163
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,358
Changed.

164
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,677
You lock him in? Why?

165
00:11:56,849 --> 00:12:01,013
He's lived so long that way,
that an open door <i>would...</i>

166
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:02,415
Is it possible?

167
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:04,988
All things are possible in France today...

168
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:09,218
...just as all things will be possible later.

169
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:11,528
Don't come in to him yet.

170
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:13,062
Let us go first.

171
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:21,403
Still hard at work?

172
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:26,070
Yes, l... I'm working.

173
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,372
These shoes must be done.

174
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:31,277
You have a visitor, you see.

175
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,615
A visitor.

176
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:37,387
Show your work to monsieur.

177
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,932
It is a lady's shoe.

178
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:55,301
It is a young lady's walking shoe.

179
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,239
It is in the present mode.

180
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,742
I never saw the mode.

181
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,108
I did it from a drawing.

182
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:13,050
Dr. Manette, do you remember me?

183
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:21,461
Come, come, now. Do you remember
an old friend in Tellson's Bank in London?

184
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,192
No.

185
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:26,131
No.

186
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:46,389
Who are you?

187
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:53,459
Who are you?

188
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,633
It is the same...

189
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:05,072
...but how can it be?

190
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,079
It is the same...

191
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,317
...but she is dead.

192
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,076
Yes.

193
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:19,021
My mother is dead, but I <i>am...</i>

194
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:22,051
Can't you feel who I am?

195
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:27,488
She had laid her head on my shoulder...

196
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:31,567
...and when I was brought
to the North Tower...

197
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:37,567
...they found hair like this...

198
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:40,177
...on my sleeve.

199
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,011
How was this?

200
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:45,910
Was it you?

201
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:50,985
I'm Lucie, her daughter.

202
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,382
Your daughter.

203
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,360
Do you think he's fit
to make a journey to England?

204
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:02,523
Get him out of France for his sake, and for
the sake of the Jacquerie who rescued him.

205
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:05,101
- What is this Jacquerie?
- One day you will know.

206
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,364
All France will know.

207
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:10,030
You're coming with me, Father.

208
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,034
Wait.

209
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:13,843
Wait.

210
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:22,178
Where is the place?

211
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:25,482
The brick was here by the bench.

212
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:26,886
It's gone.

213
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:29,926
- What's he looking for?
- Something he wrote in the Bastille.

214
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,392
And it was left in his cell?

215
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:32,825
No, we found it.

216
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:36,957
A reminder of such horror,
it's better he should never see it again.

217
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:42,672
Father, dear, we shall find it.

218
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:46,470
You're coming with me now. Home.

219
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,240
Home.

220
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:05,185
No one saw a coach leave here,
you understand?

221
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:10,433
Eighteen years in a cell without a trial...

222
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:14,299
...because an aristocrat chose
to brush the good doctor from his path.

223
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,771
Too bad we don't know
which aristo it was.

224
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:18,204
But I do know.

225
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:20,436
I have cause to remember.

226
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:23,877
His outrages against my own family
would never let me forget.

227
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:27,143
Then you have his name on your register?

228
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:30,078
He has the place of honor.

229
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:33,247
The Marquis St. Evremonde.

230
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,057
Killed.

231
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,721
Dead.

232
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:22,205
The child is dead, Excellency.

233
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:27,643
It's extraordinary to me that you cannot
take care of yourselves and your children.

234
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,940
One or the other of you
is forever in the way.

235
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,583
How do you know what injury
you might do to my horses?

236
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,413
Drive on, faster.

237
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:41,254
Irritating episode.

238
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:53,766
The marquis drives fast.

239
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:58,035
We'll drive him fast to his tomb.

240
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,597
My dear nephew,
what goes forward here?

241
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,740
I'm leaving. I'm going to England.

242
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:30,664
Really?

243
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,177
Monsieur Gabelle,
when you were my nephew's tutor...

244
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:36,814
...you shouldn't have encouraged him
to be so petulant.

245
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:39,883
You've made the name Evremonde
the most detested in all France.

246
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,610
I can't endure your cruelty.

247
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:45,518
There is a sickness these days
which labels itself humanitarianism.

248
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:47,488
You have no pity for those who suffer.

249
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:51,060
Pity, my dear boy,
is a diseased variety of sentimentality.

250
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,130
Do you pity the swine
whose flesh we eat?

251
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,663
The peasants are not swine.

252
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,700
That, my dear Charles,
is where you and I differ.

253
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,430
I'm very much afraid,
that you have taught my nephew...

254
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:03,006
...to take the new philosophy
of equality seriously.

255
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:06,702
Now, I enjoy Monsieur Voltaire
and these other modern philosophers, but l...

256
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,905
I take them lightly,
and merely as an exercise for the mind.

257
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,481
Most of our lands are stolen.

258
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,312
I intend to see them returned
to the peasants.

259
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,817
Really?

260
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:20,786
Thank your stars that you're related to me,
or you might find yourself in the Bastille.

261
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:24,087
Monseigneur, I pray you overlook
the impulsiveness of youth.

262
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:27,323
- I'm not frightened of anything you can do.
- Charles, I beg of you.

263
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:32,163
I'm not at all sure that it wouldn't be the
patriotic thing to imprison you, Charles...

264
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,737
...in spite of the pain
it would cause me personally.

265
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:39,571
By the bye, if you should run into
any difficulties in England, let me know.

266
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:43,340
The prisons, even in that utopia,
are very uncomfortable, they tell me.

267
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:47,076
A pleasant journey, Mr. Darnay.

268
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:50,718
What did he mean by that?

269
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:52,584
The steel hand in the velvet glove.

270
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,420
- But he's capable of anything.
- I'm not troubled, Gabelle.

271
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:58,222
Charles, let me go with you.

272
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:00,092
I can't take you now...

273
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,529
...but some day we'll be together.

274
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:05,065
God bless you, Charles.

275
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:12,305
On the boat to England,
you say, Morveau?

276
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:15,037
Do you think it can be done
on the boat to England?

277
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,183
Darnay will be arrested the day he lands.

278
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,818
You are ingenious, Morveau.

279
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,351
I like your plan.

280
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,682
- Proceed with it.
- Very well, Your Excellency.

281
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:27,290
The boy is capricious.
He needs correction.

282
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,552
Yes, Your Excellency.

283
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,671
Here we are, Dr. Manette,
safe in England...

284
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:49,644
...and you've borne the voyage
like a seasoned traveler.

285
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:52,807
It's been a pleasant voyage.

286
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:57,547
Your kindness has done me good,
much good.

287
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:02,187
It's nice to be one's self again.

288
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:05,859
Believe me, Miss Manette,
I'm sorry the voyage is ending.

289
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:10,593
And l... I can't tell you how glad I am
your hatbox fell into the water at Calais.

290
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,327
Really, Mr. Darnay.

291
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:17,942
Oh, I only meant that rescuing it gave me
the opportunity to meet you and your father.

292
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,238
And it gave me the opportunity
to hear your instructive discourse...

293
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,677
...on George Washington
and the rights of man.

294
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:25,407
Now you're making sport of me.

295
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:28,712
Oh, no, Mr. Darnay,
it was most edifying.

296
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:30,684
Ahoy, ashore.

297
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:36,990
- All right, hand me my luggage, my bag.
- Get back.

298
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,527
Sorry.

299
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,790
There we are. Hurry up, lad.
Good, that's it.

300
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,695
Bon voyage.

301
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,036
Barsad.

302
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:55,141
Now to find the carriage,
and then for London, eh, doctor?

303
00:21:56,615 --> 00:22:00,210
I wonder, Miss Manette, if I may presume
to call upon you at your home?

304
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,080
On such short acquaintance?

305
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:03,653
Oh, Mr. Darnay.

306
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:09,089
Certainly a crossing from Calais in this fog
cannot be called short acquaintance.

307
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:10,489
Do let me see you again.

308
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,323
Lucie, dear, ready?

309
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,362
Yes, Father.

310
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:20,466
Thank you, Mr. Darnay,
for all your kindness.

311
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:23,470
- Goodbye then until Sunday.
- Sunday?

312
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:27,476
I told Father I was inviting you to sup
with us on Sunday at our house in Soho.

313
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,238
Goodbye.

314
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,341
Goodbye, young man, until Sunday.

315
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,984
Which one is Evremonde?

316
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,686
That's him there.

317
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:44,022
But he calls himself Darnay,
Charles Darnay.

318
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:48,223
I tell you, the marquis is going to make it
well worthwhile for the both of us.

319
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:14,890
Really, not working yet, Carton?
This is too much.

320
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,051
You've got to put your mind
on this case.

321
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,891
No, not possible.

322
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:26,062
They've got this Charles Darnay
up for treason.

323
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,967
I don't know Charles Darnay.

324
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,337
I hate treason, I hate Frenchmen...
For that matter, I hate Englishmen.

325
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,375
Yes, but Lorry
sent this case on to us...

326
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:36,173
...with a special request
for all my consideration.

327
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:38,578
It's not my consideration he wants,
it's yours.

328
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,149
Why don't you give it to him.

329
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:42,411
Of course, I count on you
for a little help.

330
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:45,078
You don't need me.
You're the great barrister Stryver.

331
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,487
Stryver of the King's Bench Bar.

332
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:50,321
Well, if I am, it's due to perseverance.

333
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:54,090
I had to get into the front rank.
I wasn't born there, was I?

334
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,057
I use my brains.

335
00:23:56,234 --> 00:24:00,500
- You use mine, you mean.
- Well, if I do, I pay you for it.

336
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:03,538
Well, not enough to justify
your interfering with my drinking.

337
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,403
But this is a treason case.

338
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:07,568
It's a matter of life and death.

339
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:09,611
Well, so is everything else. What of it?

340
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:13,046
Carton, I beg of you,
have a look at this brief.

341
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:17,319
Really, with a man's life in your hands,
how can you hesitate?

342
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:20,322
- I don't hesitate.
- But I tell you, Darnay is lost.

343
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:22,824
We have to find a way to counteract
the evidence...

344
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:24,757
...of these witnesses, Barsad and Cly.

345
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:29,128
Barsad and Cly. Cly and Barsad.
Barsad and Cly.

346
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,701
A case like that
could be tried on mere sound.

347
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,861
What are you talking about?

348
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:38,339
Well, Barsad and Cly or Cly and Barsad...

349
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,946
...by the very sound of their names,
by the build of their syllables...

350
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:46,209
...are manifestly villains.
Just as the other fellow...

351
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:48,648
The... The defendant,
what was his name?

352
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,880
Darnay. Charles Darnay.

353
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:54,257
Equally, manifestly a gentleman.

354
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:59,363
But you can't convict a man on syllables,
on the sound of his name.

355
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,154
Barsad.

356
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,267
Barsad.

357
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:06,298
I seem to know that name.

358
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:12,436
Wasn't he involved in
a treason case once before?

359
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:14,340
Barsad. Yes, he was.

360
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:19,215
I believe we've uncovered
something here, Carton.

361
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:26,986
Well, Mr. Darnay, fate and Mr. Barsad
have it that I should handle your case.

362
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:28,750
Your life is in my hands.

363
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:31,953
I may lead you to fortune or the grave.
Who knows, and who cares?

364
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:36,123
I wish you'd stop drinking, or I wouldn't
give much for Mr. Darnay's fortune.

365
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:39,031
You know, I shouldn't wonder
but that Cruncher...

366
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:42,196
...Jerry Cruncher,
knows this fellow Barsad.

367
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,841
I think I'll call on Jerry.

368
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:46,409
I can't have you hobnobbing
with a fellow like him.

369
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:47,977
Why, he's a grave robber.

370
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:50,512
Now, a man who employs me
shouldn't be a snob.

371
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:51,910
But he's a grave robber.

372
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:55,052
You don't discern the facts.
The very pith and marrow escape you.

373
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,245
Do you know the most interesting
thing to me?

374
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:59,447
Saving an innocent man
from a horrible death.

375
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:03,492
No. It's that Cruncher probably knows
the tavern that Barsad drinks at.

376
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:07,462
That means I can pursue this case
in a congenial atmosphere.

377
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:09,156
You're in luck, Stryver.

378
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:13,065
I'll lay you a wager.
I'll drink you a victory.

379
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:18,670
Oh, dear Lord,
don't let him be a grave robber.

380
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:22,210
Have mercy on us.
Don't let him be a grave robber.

381
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,607
Oh, dear <i>God...</i>

382
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:28,252
Bust me if she ain't at it again.

383
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:31,881
Flopping yourself down
and praying against my prosperity.

384
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:34,321
Oh, Jerry, how can I keep from praying...

385
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:36,756
...now that I know
what your real business is?

386
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:40,762
Listen, Aggerawayter, I won't have me
wittles blessed off me table by your praying.

387
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,331
A grave robber.

388
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,797
Don't say that word.

389
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:45,937
I'm a resurrectionist, that's what I am.

390
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:50,131
Doing a service for the medical profession,
besides making a bit of money for myself.

391
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:53,243
So that's why your fingers
is always rusty, Father.

392
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:54,810
Quiet, you.

393
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:58,609
You're an unnatural wife and
an unnatural mother, praying against me.

394
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,274
I wasn't praying against you,
I was praying for you.

395
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,853
And I tell you I won't be
took the liberty with.

396
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:06,047
You've got a fine mother, you have...

397
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:09,853
...praying that the bread and butter
be snatched out of the mouth of her child.

398
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:12,087
Father, I think she's flopping again.

399
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:15,289
- What, more flopping?
- No, no, no. I was meditating.

400
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,901
And I won't have you meditating neither.

401
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:21,334
Prayed against and meditated against
in me own home.

402
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:24,207
Jerry.

403
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:26,936
- How are you, Mr. Carton?
- Not rusty, huh?

404
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:28,511
- Oh, no, sir.
- Good.

405
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:33,083
- You'll never see them rusty again.
- Jerry, do you know a man called Cly?

406
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:36,812
Cly? No, I don't believes I do, sir.

407
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,785
Know anybody called Barsad?

408
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:40,584
Oh, Barsad. I knows him, sir.

409
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:43,250
- A great fellow for bowling.
- Where do I find him?

410
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:45,419
You might find him
bowling down at Puffey's.

411
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:47,087
Good.

412
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:49,230
But if you're going to meet him...

413
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,733
...you won't be keeping
very good company.

414
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:54,337
Neither will Mr. Barsad.

415
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:06,647
- Hey, whose idea was it?
- Mine.

416
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:08,615
I did all the brainwork.

417
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:10,721
Oh, I see.

418
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:13,787
Told them where to hold up the coach...

419
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:16,791
...and when to shoot the coachman.

420
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:21,489
And after doing all that for them,
what do you think they did, Barsad?

421
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:22,997
Run away with the swag?

422
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:27,070
Oh, oh, Barsad, where did you
learn so much of human nature?

423
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:29,763
In a really hard school of experience.

424
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:33,809
I don't believe in nobody,
and I don't trust nobody.

425
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:36,071
That's right.
Made up my mind, same thing.

426
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:38,340
Nobody. Never trust nobody.

427
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:41,144
But them swine,
did you get back at them?

428
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:43,184
Did I get ba...?

429
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:45,618
Did I fix something up on them.

430
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,917
- Did you plant something on them?
- Plant...

431
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:50,186
Oh, you got a brain, Barsad.

432
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:53,091
- You got a brain.
- What did you plant on them?

433
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,960
If I tell you where I last saw them...

434
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:01,799
...maybe you'll guess
what I planted on them.

435
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:03,934
Where did you see them?

436
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:05,804
Outside Newgate Prison.

437
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:07,205
Newgate?

438
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:08,606
With my own eyes.

439
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:13,114
First hung up and then quartered.

440
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:15,013
Drawn and quartered?

441
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:18,314
Like animals, drawn and quartered.
You guessed it, Barsad.

442
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,118
Now... Now, let that brain of yours...

443
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:24,784
...work out what I planted on them.

444
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:28,694
Treason. You got them for treason.

445
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:32,628
You're a great man, Barsad.
You guessed it.

446
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:36,365
- Treason, eh?
- Now, Barsad, match that if you can!

447
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,566
Right. I will match it.

448
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:41,576
If you'll take the trouble
to go to the Old Bailey tomorrow...

449
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:44,146
...you'll have the pleasure
of seeing a Frenchman...

450
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:46,442
...by the name of Darnay, up for treason.

451
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,917
Put there by no other
than your humble servant.

452
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:53,888
No. Oh, if that's true,
I take my hat off to you, Barsad.

453
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:56,288
Then doff it right now.

454
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,259
- Wait till I tell you how I did it.
- No, another drink first.

455
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,797
- There's plenty of time.
- No, no. Now, let me tell you.

456
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:07,762
Now, Mr. Barsad, will you please
tell us, in your own way...

457
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:13,502
...just what happened on the boat, just how
your attention was attracted to the prisoner.

458
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:17,307
Well, sir, I was strolling about
having a bit of exercise...

459
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,042
...when I passed a cabin door
which happened to be open.

460
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,914
I looked down, and I noticed
some papers on the floor.

461
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:24,952
I thought they might be valuable.

462
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:26,750
So, thinks I to myself:

463
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:30,122
"Here's my opportunity to do
a good turn for some poor chap."

464
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:32,991
You know, l... I likes doing
that sort of thing.

465
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:38,101
Do not delay, my good man.
Just get to the incriminating facts.

466
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:40,769
Yes, milord.

467
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:46,844
I picked up the papers, and imagine
my astonishment when I discovered...

468
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:50,606
...that they were lists
of His Majesty's forces, God bless him.

469
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:54,013
And what was your motive in turning
these papers over to the police?

470
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,483
- My duty, sir.
- Your duty to your country?

471
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:59,452
- Yes, sir.
- Your duty as a patriotic Englishman.

472
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:02,058
Your duty as a shining citizen.

473
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:06,220
I say, milord,
that were statues decreed in Britain...

474
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:09,798
...as they were in ancient Greece
and Rome to public benefactors...

475
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:13,802
...this noble citizen
would most assuredly have one.

476
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:16,406
Your Honor, I protest.

477
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:20,237
Must we have a statue or
would you be satisfied with just a bust?

478
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:23,504
Silence in court.

479
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,012
No levity, gentlemen.

480
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:29,082
That's all, Mr. Barsad.
Your witness.

481
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:41,431
"No questions now.

482
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,897
Later on, if you're not too silly, we'll..."

483
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,234
No questions now. Beg pardon, milord.

484
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:58,739
Here are the lists,
if you care to examine them.

485
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,942
Have these been
in the prisoner's possession?

486
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,416
- Yes, milord.
- Oh, dear.

487
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:04,454
Can't be too careful, you know.

488
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:06,988
Jail fever. Very prevalent.

489
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:10,286
I now call Miss Lucie Manette.

490
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:21,500
Miss Manette,
have you seen the prisoner before?

491
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:23,265
Oh, most unhappily, yes.

492
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:27,400
Answer the questions put to you.
Make no remark upon them.

493
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,710
Where did you first meet him?

494
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:33,817
- When the gentleman came onboard, l...
- lf you mean the prisoner, say the prisoner.

495
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:39,353
The prisoner noticed that my father
was in a very weak state of health.

496
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:42,755
He was very kind and good to my father.

497
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:44,220
To us both.

498
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:48,632
I hope I won't repay him
by doing him harm today.

499
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,963
It's your duty to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but.

500
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:55,299
The prisoner understands that, or should.

501
00:32:56,874 --> 00:32:59,809
The prisoner was overheard
to make some remark about America.

502
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,946
What was it? Be particular.

503
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:06,448
He tried to explain to me
the quarrel between England and America...

504
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:10,485
...and said that it might have been avoided
had England been more understanding.

505
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:16,426
- Oh, he made treasonable remarks like that?
- There was no harm in the way he said this.

506
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:20,291
- It was said only to beguile the time.
- We'll leave that for the jury to decide.

507
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:23,957
That will be all, Miss Manette.
Your witness.

508
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:27,496
No questions, milord.

509
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:32,631
With your permission, milord,
I'd like to call the witness, Barsad, again.

510
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:42,951
Mr. Barsad, did you discuss this case
with Mr. Cly last night?

511
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:47,854
Last night? Why, sir, l... I haven't seen
Mr. Cly since last Sunday's services.

512
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:52,895
Services. My guess is
he stole the collection box.

513
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:54,895
Where were you last night?

514
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,431
At home. Working.

515
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:58,068
Working, Mr. Barsad?

516
00:33:58,236 --> 00:33:59,999
Just what is your profession?

517
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:02,901
- Gentleman.
- Retired, of course.

518
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:04,439
And on what do you live?

519
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,167
On my property.

520
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:07,743
Where is it?

521
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:10,676
Well, l... I haven't any just now.

522
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:13,908
Oh, then at present you're not living.

523
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:15,712
Silence in court.

524
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:20,347
Really, Mr. Stryver, I don't see that
these questions are at all relevant.

525
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:24,621
- Mr. Barsad, have you ever been kicked?
- Certainly not.

526
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:26,195
Come, come, Mr. Barsad.

527
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:28,924
Weren't you one time kicked down stairs?

528
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:33,127
Well, once I was kicked
at the top of the stairs...

529
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:37,035
...but I fell down the stairs
of my own will and volition.

530
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:40,769
Wasn't that kick the result of
your stealing a silver teapot?

531
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:46,178
I was maligned about a mustard pot,
but it turned out to be only plated.

532
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,375
Oh, I see. You were maligned.

533
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:51,113
Do you know a French marquis?

534
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,016
- No, sir.
- No?

535
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:56,956
A relative of the prisoner's?

536
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:59,688
- No, sir.
- No?

537
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:03,634
And now, Mr. Barsad,
I want to ask you the vital question.

538
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:07,237
The attorney general has told us
that his whole case rests...

539
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:10,932
...upon the identification of a certain man
whom you say is the prisoner.

540
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:14,169
A man whom you saw enter the cabin
on the Dover boat.

541
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:17,314
Now, I want you to be very, very careful.

542
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:20,076
After all, all we want is the truth.

543
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:25,780
Now, are you quite certain
that the man you saw was the prisoner?

544
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:31,987
- Yes, sir.
- Couldn't have made a mistake?

545
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:33,391
No, sir.

546
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:37,398
Couldn't have mistaken him for me,
for instance?

547
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:40,298
- Oh, no, sir.
- Or his lordship, perhaps?

548
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,934
Piffle.

549
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:44,634
No, sir.

550
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:49,178
Well then, could you have mistaken him
for my learned friend here?

551
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,243
<i>Why...</i>

552
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:59,612
Now you seem to think otherwise.

553
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:03,021
Will milord bid my learned friend
lay aside his wig for a minute?

554
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:05,788
I don't think it's necessary,
but if he doesn't mind...

555
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:08,488
...and won't catch cold in his head.

556
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:12,763
Now, Mr. Barsad...

557
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:17,168
...couldn't you have mistaken the prisoner
for Mr. Carton there?

558
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,002
No, <i>I...</i>

559
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:29,144
Well, sir, come to think of it,
as a matter of fact...

560
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:32,917
...it was not the prisoner at all, sir.

561
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,318
That's all, milord.

562
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:37,290
As far as I'm concerned,
it's quite sufficient.

563
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:42,989
Gentlemen... the jury will retire
and consider their verdict.

564
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:51,039
I'll never understand how
you got him to change his evidence.

565
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,871
I just have a way of getting
at the essence of the facts.

566
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,479
- The pith and marrow, as it were.
- Oh, really?

567
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:58,137
Oh, yes, quite so, quite so.

568
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,716
Oh, Mr. Carton,
if you'll excuse me.

569
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:05,015
Charles... Mr. Darnay
will be acquitted, won't he?

570
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:09,220
If the jury understands evidence, Charles...
Mr. Darnay will be acquitted.

571
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,156
Mr. Stryver's defense was brilliant.

572
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,194
Wonderful. If he does get off...

573
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,628
...it'll be entirely due
to Mr. Stryver, won't it?

574
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,268
Nothing to it. Mere professional claptrap.

575
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:21,166
Young sir, give credit
where credit is due.

576
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:25,338
Mr. Lorry, I would like Charles to know
we wish him well.

577
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:27,477
- Would you tell him for me?
- No, I better.

578
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:30,739
It wouldn't do for respectable businessmen,
especially bankers...

579
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,940
...to be seen talking to the prisoner.

580
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:37,053
- Might tell against the prisoner.
- Yes. Upstart.

581
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,195
Silence in court.

582
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:48,428
Gentlemen of the jury,
have you agreed upon your verdict?

583
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,227
- We have.
- What is your verdict?

584
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:52,892
Not guilty.

585
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:56,562
The prisoner at the bar,
the jury has found you not guilty.

586
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,370
Prisoner dismissed.

587
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,886
I'm so glad.

588
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:16,322
So very glad.

589
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:22,798
Charles. Charles, my boy.

590
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,561
- Glad to have got you off with honor.
- You saved my life.

591
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:27,465
Never any other outcome possible.

592
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:30,505
Barsad and Cly. Cly and Barsad.

593
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:33,075
I could have told from
the sound of their names...

594
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:36,805
...from the very run of the syllables,
that they <i>were...</i>

595
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:39,713
Well, anyway, it was
all very simple, really.

596
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:45,786
Well, Mr. Stryver,
shows you can't tell brains by appearance.

597
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:56,662
Barsad.

598
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,997
As between fellow artists,
why not try another country?

599
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:03,368
Yes, sir. Yes, Mr. Carton,
I think I should love to travel.

600
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:04,872
Perhaps France.

601
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:09,001
Or you might like to go even further,
say, China.

602
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,842
Never trust nobody.

603
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,576
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Miss Manette.

604
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:18,753
My boy, never for a moment
did I doubt your innocence.

605
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:22,552
So, Mr. Lorry, respectable men of business
may speak to Mr. Darnay in public...

606
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,888
...now he's acquitted.
- You mentioned that before.

607
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:28,429
We men of business must think of
the house we serve more than ourselves.

608
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:32,035
Yes, yes. Banking, of course,
imposes its own restrictions and silences.

609
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,195
And indeed, sir, I don't know
that it is any of your business.

610
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,466
- I have no business.
- And if you had, sir...

611
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:41,577
...perhaps you would attend to it.
- Lord, love you, no, I wouldn't.

612
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:50,481
Mr. Darnay,
you're a very fortunate young man.

613
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:52,679
I beg your pardon, sir.

614
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:56,953
Well, it's not long since you were well
advanced on your way to another world.

615
00:39:57,128 --> 00:40:00,154
I'm... I'm very grateful to Mr. Stryver
and to you.

616
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:02,629
Would you...?
Would you care to dine with me?

617
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,292
No, I don't dine,
but I'll wine with you.

618
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,567
Well, Mr. Darnay...

619
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:14,734
...how does it feel to belong
to this terrestrial scheme again...

620
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,437
...to taste, to feel, to be alive?

621
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:19,674
It's very agreeable.

622
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:22,910
- I'm glad you find it so.
- Why, don't you?

623
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,987
I?

624
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:30,088
Matter of fact, Mr. Darnay,
I care for no man...

625
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:32,462
...and no man cares for me.

626
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,861
You seem to be rather bitter today.

627
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:36,590
I suppose you were up all night.

628
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,993
- All night.
- No sleep, I'll wager.

629
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:41,229
- Not a wink.
- Just drinking.

630
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:43,464
Very sad. Just drinking.

631
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:45,233
For no reason?

632
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:46,637
For no reason.

633
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:49,609
Well, pardon me, but...
But why do it?

634
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:54,681
You are smug, Mr. Darnay,
when you ask why people drink...

635
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:56,683
...but I'll tell you.

636
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:01,384
So that they can stand
their fellow men better.

637
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:05,285
After a few bottles
I might even like you.

638
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:09,525
You've been kind to me, and
I'll not reward you by taking offense.

639
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,928
There's a good fellow.

640
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:13,865
A toast then. Let's drink a toast. Drink...

641
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,441
...to the person
that's nearest your heart.

642
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:20,702
- To the person...?
- The one you're thinking of.

643
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:22,539
- But I don't know...
- Come now, man...

644
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:24,305
...it's on the tip of your tongue.

645
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,211
Very well. To Miss Manette.

646
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:28,180
Miss Manette.

647
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:34,348
There's a fair young lady to hand
to a coach in the dark.

648
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:40,795
There's a fair young lady to be pitied by
and wept for by.

649
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,325
Must be worth being tried for one's life...

650
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:48,666
...to be the object of such sympathy
and compassion.

651
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:52,471
Well, Miss Manette.

652
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:59,780
Oh, waiter, glass.

653
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:07,889
Tell me, Mr. Darnay,
do you think I particularly like you?

654
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:11,027
- I've not asked myself that question.
- Well, ask it now.

655
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:14,289
I thought you did,
but you're acting now as if you don't.

656
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:18,124
I begin to have a better opinion
of your understanding.

657
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:19,826
Waiter.

658
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:22,632
There is nothing to prevent
my settling for the dinner.

659
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:26,003
- Oh, nothing in the world.
- Let me have the record.

660
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:29,345
- You call the...? The whole dinner?
- I do.

661
00:42:29,513 --> 00:42:34,541
In that case, waiter, another bottle.

662
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,714
- Thank you.
- Good night, sir.

663
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,651
Good night.

664
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:43,888
And don't let your sober face elate you.

665
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:48,095
You never know what it may come to.

666
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,941
Why treat the fellow like that?

667
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:06,077
Is it because he shows you
what you have fallen away from...

668
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,514
...what you might have been?

669
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:14,789
Change places with him.

670
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:20,128
Would you have been looked at
by those blue eyes as he was?

671
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:23,694
Come on, Carton, you're jealous.

672
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:28,770
Have it out in plain words.
You hate the fellow.

673
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:49,218
I've got to be getting home.

674
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:50,690
Christmas, you know.

675
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:53,762
Home? Where can you better find
the spirit of Christmas...

676
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:55,831
...than a good old English tavern?

677
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,093
But a tavern ain't a home.

678
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:01,362
No, at home you bicker and quarrel.

679
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:05,372
And here, it's all peace on Earth,
good will to men.

680
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:07,806
Drink up, gentlemen. Good will to men.

681
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,879
Merry Christmas!

682
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:14,680
Really, what can be keeping Mr. Darnay?

683
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:18,652
A man who would be late for Christmas
services would be late for his own wedding.

684
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:21,518
Charles told me he had to see
Mr. Lorry about something.

685
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:22,920
Important indeed.

686
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:26,153
Anything can be more important
to a young man than going to church.

687
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,993
For myself, I'm very sorry to see Mr. Darnay
go into Mr. Lorry's bank.

688
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:34,035
You all think it was a great kindness
on Mr. Lorry's part, but I don't...

689
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:38,300
...because I think Mr. Lorry is an atheist.
All bankers are atheists.

690
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:43,480
- Good evening, Mr. Darnay.
- Good evening.

691
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,610
- Merry Christmas, Charles.
- Merry Christmas, Lucie.

692
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:50,720
Merry Christmas, Miss Pross,
Dr. Manette.

693
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:52,879
Merry Christmas.
We've been waiting for you.

694
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:55,218
Will you forgive me
if I don't go to church?

695
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:57,019
I must speak to your father about...

696
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:59,492
- About something that has arisen.
- You're worried.

697
00:44:59,663 --> 00:45:01,187
Oh, it's nothing serious, Lucie.

698
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:04,528
- Lf only I could speak to Dr. Manette.
- Certainly.

699
00:45:05,169 --> 00:45:07,967
Mr. Lorry has sent Jerry Cruncher
to light you to the church.

700
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:11,039
We'll come back directly after the service.
You'll wait for us?

701
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:13,768
- Yes, l...
- Well, come along, Lucie.

702
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:16,538
Not going to church, indeed. Atheist.

703
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:20,013
Bankers and Frenchmen, all atheists.

704
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:23,119
May I remind you
that the port on the sideboard...

705
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:26,552
...is for the party after services
and not for haphazard consumption.

706
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:29,192
Oh, Pross, do come along.

707
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:32,859
Won't you sit down, Charles.

708
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:36,329
I will not delay disclosing to you
what I have to say, Dr. Manette.

709
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,958
I have just learned from Mr. Lorry
something that distresses me deeply.

710
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:42,037
It is a bitter irony, sir...

711
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:45,642
...that this man,
who did you such a dreadful injustice...

712
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:47,909
...should be my blood relation.

713
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:50,604
I'm very sorry.

714
00:45:51,148 --> 00:45:55,107
Can you understand that l...?
That I had to tell you?

715
00:45:55,986 --> 00:46:00,582
Yes, I understand you had to tell me.

716
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:04,387
I am an Evremonde,
but I love you and yours.

717
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:07,860
For you and Lucie I would give up my life,
if necessary.

718
00:46:08,132 --> 00:46:12,796
Dr. Manette, can you find it
in your heart to forgive me?

719
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:16,167
You showed character, Charles,
in coming to me.

720
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,865
And I have no blame for you.

721
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:22,978
In suffering, one learns many things.

722
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:26,583
Among them,
not to punish the innocent.

723
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,445
I shall never forget your kindness.

724
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,712
- But you must promise me one thing.
- Anything.

725
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:33,448
- You must not tell Lucie.
- But I must. That would be...

726
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:37,355
You must let me tell her in my own way,
in my own time...

727
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:41,692
...or you may spoil not only
your own happiness, but hers.

728
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:42,923
Trust me, Charles.

729
00:46:46,635 --> 00:46:50,799
I don't like Mr. Lorry sending dozens
of people to look after us we don't want.

730
00:46:50,973 --> 00:46:53,567
If he's so anxious about us,
why didn't he come himself?

731
00:46:53,743 --> 00:46:56,234
Oh, no, not himself, the old atheist.

732
00:46:56,412 --> 00:46:59,472
Now, you know perfectly well
Mr. Lorry is the soul of kindness.

733
00:46:59,648 --> 00:47:03,209
- Mr. Cruncher is his odd-job man.
- Odd-job man, indeed.

734
00:47:03,386 --> 00:47:07,379
From what I can gather,
he's the oddest of odd-job men.

735
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:09,548
Wait.

736
00:47:11,394 --> 00:47:13,794
Good evening, Mr. Carton.

737
00:47:13,963 --> 00:47:17,660
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you, Miss Manette.

738
00:47:17,833 --> 00:47:19,357
Miss Pross, merry Christmas.

739
00:47:19,535 --> 00:47:21,560
I'd say merry Christmas to you,
Mr. Carton...

740
00:47:21,737 --> 00:47:24,399
...if it weren't plain to see
that you'd already had it.

741
00:47:24,573 --> 00:47:28,600
Were you going to midnight service?
We're going. Do come with us.

742
00:47:29,178 --> 00:47:32,875
Why not? Thank you, Miss Manette.

743
00:47:35,117 --> 00:47:37,278
It's dangerous taking him to church,
Miss Pross.

744
00:47:37,453 --> 00:47:40,013
He'll forget where he is
and call for a round of drinks.

745
00:47:40,189 --> 00:47:44,683
Hold your tongue and hold that lantern
higher, or I'll bash you with this umbrella.

746
00:48:17,693 --> 00:48:20,093
I'll light a candle for you.

747
00:49:11,881 --> 00:49:16,580
Go along, my man. And I hope
you mend your ways in the future.

748
00:49:19,588 --> 00:49:21,852
Lucie, my pet,
your father's waiting for you.

749
00:49:22,024 --> 00:49:24,686
And as you know,
he doesn't like crowds of people about...

750
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:26,589
...especially on Christmas Eve.

751
00:49:26,762 --> 00:49:29,629
Please tell him I'll come in
in just a moment.

752
00:49:31,834 --> 00:49:33,062
Won't you come in too?

753
00:49:33,235 --> 00:49:36,602
- We're having a little Christmas celebration.
- Oh, I'm afraid not.

754
00:49:36,772 --> 00:49:39,935
- Thank you, Miss Manette.
- You'll be very welcome.

755
00:49:40,142 --> 00:49:44,476
I must tell you, Miss Manette, that when
you met me, I wasn't on my way to church.

756
00:49:44,914 --> 00:49:46,108
I know.

757
00:49:46,782 --> 00:49:51,219
My usual Christmas Eve,
going from tavern to tavern.

758
00:49:52,721 --> 00:49:57,749
Well, I know, <i>but...</i> Well, we...
We can't always be at our best.

759
00:49:58,761 --> 00:50:00,285
Won't you please come in?

760
00:50:00,963 --> 00:50:05,297
Not like this.
If I may come some other time.

761
00:50:05,868 --> 00:50:07,130
Please do.

762
00:50:07,303 --> 00:50:10,101
I'd love to have you for a friend.

763
00:50:12,975 --> 00:50:15,375
So... So would Father.

764
00:50:21,183 --> 00:50:23,276
Merry Christmas.

765
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:24,739
You're making quite a tea drinker
out of me, Prossie. Aren't you ashamed?

766
00:51:24,913 --> 00:51:28,974
I am Miss Pross. And as for being ashamed,
why should I be ashamed?

767
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:31,745
For giving you a decent home
to come to, I suppose.

768
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,388
For saving you
from the gallows, practically.

769
00:51:34,556 --> 00:51:37,684
- Ashamed... indeed.
- Oh, Miss Pross...

770
00:51:38,294 --> 00:51:41,695
...don't you think, at times, you're inclined
to exaggerate just a trifle?

771
00:51:41,864 --> 00:51:45,891
One of Prossie's most endearing gifts.
That's why I love you.

772
00:51:46,068 --> 00:51:50,129
I'll have you know, I'm not one of those
flibbertigibbeties you can take liberties with.

773
00:51:50,306 --> 00:51:51,671
No more liberties, Prossie.

774
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:56,334
And I'll thank you to call me Miss Pross
or not address me at all.

775
00:51:59,148 --> 00:52:02,447
You know, I believe you've completely
captivated Pross.

776
00:52:02,618 --> 00:52:05,348
She's part of the flavor
of this house to me.

777
00:52:05,521 --> 00:52:10,515
I couldn't imagine it without her, no more
than without these paintings of yours.

778
00:52:10,693 --> 00:52:13,753
- It's beautiful.
- Please don't look at it.

779
00:52:13,929 --> 00:52:17,421
I know it's dreadful, but I do it.

780
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:22,864
That's like my drinking.
I know it's dreadful, but I do it.

781
00:52:23,038 --> 00:52:26,235
There hasn't been quite so much
of that lately, has there?

782
00:52:27,109 --> 00:52:29,202
With your <i>influence...</i>

783
00:52:29,511 --> 00:52:32,446
Your visits here have meant so much to us,
to Father and me.

784
00:52:32,614 --> 00:52:35,947
What do you think it's meant to me,
being able to come here and see you?

785
00:52:36,118 --> 00:52:40,077
- Oh, if we've helped you, I'm glad.
- It's you. It's you who have done it.

786
00:52:41,323 --> 00:52:45,419
I've always felt in you
such hidden possibilities.

787
00:52:45,594 --> 00:52:49,928
- It seems such a pity to...
- To waste them? Don't be afraid to say it.

788
00:52:50,099 --> 00:52:52,499
I have wasted them and myself.

789
00:52:52,668 --> 00:52:54,465
It's only now, after knowing you...

790
00:52:54,636 --> 00:52:58,402
...that I've told myself that perhaps
it's not too late.

791
00:52:58,807 --> 00:53:00,536
I'm sure it's not.

792
00:53:00,709 --> 00:53:04,668
After all, you're young.
Your whole life's before you.

793
00:53:04,847 --> 00:53:08,044
- Anything you want to <i>accomplish...</i>
- Do you believe that?

794
00:53:08,217 --> 00:53:10,208
Oh, I do.

795
00:53:10,953 --> 00:53:14,889
- It makes it worth the trying.
- Thank you, Sydney.

796
00:53:15,057 --> 00:53:18,026
That completes my happiness.

797
00:53:21,663 --> 00:53:25,895
I wonder if you know how much
your happiness means to me.

798
00:53:26,068 --> 00:53:31,096
Oh, of course I do.
You're my very dearest friend.

799
00:53:32,474 --> 00:53:34,635
I must tell you.

800
00:53:35,344 --> 00:53:36,572
What?

801
00:53:36,745 --> 00:53:39,475
- Can't you guess?
- Guess?

802
00:53:40,115 --> 00:53:42,276
I'm going to be married.

803
00:53:47,122 --> 00:53:48,487
Charles Darnay.

804
00:53:49,124 --> 00:53:50,591
Yes.

805
00:53:57,966 --> 00:54:00,662
Aren't you going to wish me happiness?

806
00:54:01,270 --> 00:54:06,469
Happiness, yes. Yes, of course.
All that you deserve.

807
00:54:10,813 --> 00:54:12,075
Amen.

808
00:54:12,247 --> 00:54:13,839
I join you together in marriage...

809
00:54:14,016 --> 00:54:17,952
...in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost, amen.

810
00:54:19,988 --> 00:54:23,583
And now, for the first time, Mrs. Darnay.

811
00:54:23,759 --> 00:54:27,058
All my congratulations, Dr. Manette.

812
00:54:27,229 --> 00:54:29,129
Dear, dear. This is an occasion...

813
00:54:29,298 --> 00:54:32,529
...that makes me speculate
on all I may have lost.

814
00:54:32,701 --> 00:54:37,229
To think there might have been
a Mrs. Lorry any time these 50 years.

815
00:54:37,406 --> 00:54:38,998
You were a bachelor in your cradle.

816
00:54:39,174 --> 00:54:42,234
You were cut out for a bachelor
before you were put in your cradle.

817
00:54:42,411 --> 00:54:45,471
I may have been so in my cradle,
but since then, let me tell you...

818
00:54:45,647 --> 00:54:47,774
...there have been occasions...
- Mr. Lorry.

819
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:50,316
This is not the time or place
for such confidences.

820
00:54:50,486 --> 00:54:51,919
But...

821
00:54:55,491 --> 00:55:00,155
- Charles, have you seen Sydney?
- Why, no.

822
00:55:00,329 --> 00:55:03,628
Well, I wonder why he didn't
come to my wedding.

823
00:55:08,604 --> 00:55:11,630
Why, Sydney, why didn't you
come to the wedding?

824
00:55:11,807 --> 00:55:14,139
Pleasant ceremonies, weddings.

825
00:55:14,309 --> 00:55:17,335
You know, Sydney, come to think of it,
you ought to get married.

826
00:55:17,513 --> 00:55:19,981
Find yourself someone
to take care of you...

827
00:55:20,148 --> 00:55:22,673
...some respectable woman
with a little property.

828
00:55:22,851 --> 00:55:24,876
Landlady, lodging-house keeper.

829
00:55:25,053 --> 00:55:26,611
Marry her against a rainy day.

830
00:55:26,788 --> 00:55:31,748
Oh, must I spend my life listening to that
eternal blithering, pompous voice of yours?

831
00:55:31,927 --> 00:55:33,451
Drives me mad.

832
00:55:33,629 --> 00:55:36,723
You certainly are a funny fellow.
Never know how to take you.

833
00:55:37,666 --> 00:55:40,601
Suggest marriage to you, and you fly up.

834
00:55:40,769 --> 00:55:43,067
If you'd only seen
the joy in Lucie's <i>eyes...</i>

835
00:55:43,238 --> 00:55:46,605
Why should that surprise me?
Why shouldn't she be happy?

836
00:55:47,442 --> 00:55:48,841
Why shouldn't she be?

837
00:55:50,512 --> 00:55:55,074
You are destined for more, Gaspard,
than revenge for the murder of your child.

838
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:59,619
You may light a spark
that will kindle all France.

839
00:56:00,322 --> 00:56:01,721
I go.

840
00:56:02,591 --> 00:56:04,821
He goes.

841
00:56:33,355 --> 00:56:36,756
- "Henri Dupont, 42 francs, quit rental."
- Not enough, Gabelle.

842
00:56:36,925 --> 00:56:40,725
With what I get from these peasants,
I can hardly afford to pay my perfume bills.

843
00:56:41,129 --> 00:56:45,998
- What about Roulet? Has he paid his rent?
- No, Your Excellency, nor will he.

844
00:56:46,168 --> 00:56:47,726
Roulet died last week.

845
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:53,601
Now, that was impertinent of him.
He died with his rent unpaid.

846
00:56:53,775 --> 00:56:56,243
- Oh, what did he die of?
- Hunger.

847
00:56:56,411 --> 00:56:58,902
Hunger is an indulgence
with these peasants...

848
00:56:59,081 --> 00:57:00,412
...as gout is with us.

849
00:57:00,582 --> 00:57:04,541
It is an indulgence they would gladly
dispense with, Monseigneur.

850
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,281
Oh, I keep forgetting, Gabelle. You're a...
You're a humanitarian, aren't you?

851
00:57:08,457 --> 00:57:10,618
You think that one person
is as good as another.

852
00:57:10,792 --> 00:57:13,556
A naive notion,
so contradicted by the facts.

853
00:57:13,729 --> 00:57:17,358
But speaking of...
Speaking of humanitarians...

854
00:57:17,532 --> 00:57:19,762
...what has become of your disciple,
my nephew...

855
00:57:19,935 --> 00:57:22,426
...in the year since he left
my tyrannical roof?

856
00:57:22,604 --> 00:57:25,869
- Do you hear from him, Gabelle?
- Oh, yes. He is very happy.

857
00:57:26,041 --> 00:57:28,202
He has taken a post at Tellson's Bank.

858
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:30,740
Frightfully bourgeois.

859
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:34,742
If it weren't that my sister, Charles' mother,
were quite beyond reproach...

860
00:57:34,916 --> 00:57:38,545
...I should suspect that Charles
had tainted blood somewhere.

861
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,984
His conduct is so strange.

862
00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:43,483
It's quite mystifying.

863
00:57:44,426 --> 00:57:46,018
What was that, Gabelle?

864
00:57:46,428 --> 00:57:47,895
What, Your Excellency?

865
00:57:48,096 --> 00:57:51,463
I thought I saw somebody
at the window. Go and see.

866
00:57:52,434 --> 00:57:53,992
Certainly.

867
00:58:11,586 --> 00:58:14,749
There was nothing, Monseigneur.
Good night.

868
00:59:58,193 --> 01:00:01,356
Gentlemen. Monsieur Gabelle.

869
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:02,963
Your forgiveness, gentlemen.

870
01:00:03,131 --> 01:00:06,100
I'm certain you wouldn't have me
put promptness before gallantry.

871
01:00:06,268 --> 01:00:10,671
It's of no consequence.
Believe me, no consequence.

872
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:14,065
Monsieur Gabelle here has been
trying to frighten us...

873
01:00:14,242 --> 01:00:18,144
...with hobgoblins, werewolves
and mythical revolutionists.

874
01:00:19,714 --> 01:00:21,079
Proceed, Monsieur Gabelle.

875
01:00:21,249 --> 01:00:25,982
You may laugh, gentlemen,
but revolution is in the air.

876
01:00:26,154 --> 01:00:29,453
Yet there is still time to remove
the cause of this unrest.

877
01:00:29,724 --> 01:00:32,454
All the people ask is justice.

878
01:00:32,627 --> 01:00:36,222
Only the Jacquerie, the extremists...

879
01:00:36,398 --> 01:00:38,958
...are spreading the doctrine
of violence and bloodshed.

880
01:00:39,134 --> 01:00:43,901
And what do you suggest, Gabelle?
That we double the police force?

881
01:00:44,573 --> 01:00:47,770
Double the police? No.
Give the people bread.

882
01:00:47,943 --> 01:00:49,308
Reduce their taxes.

883
01:00:49,644 --> 01:00:54,308
Oh, l... I beseech you, gentlemen,
correct your errors or the flood will come...

884
01:00:54,482 --> 01:00:57,007
...a flood that may sweep us all
away forever.

885
01:00:57,185 --> 01:01:01,281
His terror is genuine, gentlemen,
even if his philosophy is not.

886
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:05,448
Remember your own terror five years ago
when my master met his death?

887
01:01:05,994 --> 01:01:10,124
And remember also, gentlemen, that
the Jacques who killed him is still at liberty.

888
01:01:10,298 --> 01:01:12,892
Enough of this, Gabelle.
I have a new agent in Paris...

889
01:01:13,068 --> 01:01:15,662
...a smart Englishman,
who will ferret out this murderer.

890
01:01:15,837 --> 01:01:19,864
Our gracious king also has seen
the necessity for stronger measures.

891
01:01:20,041 --> 01:01:23,807
He has brought German hussars
and Swiss infantry into Paris...

892
01:01:23,979 --> 01:01:27,073
...to give your Jacques' a good drubbing,
Monsieur Gabelle.

893
01:01:27,249 --> 01:01:29,114
Mercenaries to fight Frenchmen?

894
01:01:29,284 --> 01:01:32,549
More delicate than to slaughter them
ourselves, don't you think?

895
01:01:32,721 --> 01:01:35,281
Shall we rejoin the ladies, gentlemen?

896
01:01:40,795 --> 01:01:45,562
How I loathe intellectuals
like this fellow, peasants who read.

897
01:01:47,235 --> 01:01:49,226
I think he's right about the peasants.

898
01:01:57,545 --> 01:02:00,571
How many thousands of these
foreign soldiers are they bringing in?

899
01:02:00,749 --> 01:02:03,149
It doesn't matter how many.
It will do them no good.

900
01:02:03,318 --> 01:02:04,683
It'll do them no good.

901
01:02:05,654 --> 01:02:08,179
The starving people of Paris
might wait a long time...

902
01:02:08,356 --> 01:02:11,689
...before rising up
to fight French soldiers.

903
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:15,352
But against hired foreign troops...

904
01:02:16,464 --> 01:02:20,730
...any day, any hour.
- Any minute.

905
01:02:21,436 --> 01:02:23,097
Want this wood in the loft?

906
01:02:23,271 --> 01:02:27,901
Aristo spy. Used to be with Evremonde.
Name is Barsad.

907
01:02:31,012 --> 01:02:32,707
Good day.

908
01:02:33,181 --> 01:02:37,982
Cognac, the very best.
Never mind the cost.

909
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:41,450
These foreign soldiers are gonna fi...

910
01:02:43,191 --> 01:02:45,716
They march well, don't they?

911
01:02:46,061 --> 01:02:47,892
Very well.

912
01:02:49,397 --> 01:02:53,857
You knit with great skill, madam.
What sort of things do you make?

913
01:02:54,035 --> 01:02:56,799
Everything, mostly shrouds.

914
01:02:57,639 --> 01:02:59,300
Shrouds?

915
01:03:00,742 --> 01:03:03,836
- Business seems bad.
- Business is very bad.

916
01:03:04,012 --> 01:03:05,274
People are so poor.

917
01:03:05,814 --> 01:03:08,078
The unfortunate, miserable people.

918
01:03:08,249 --> 01:03:10,410
And so oppressed too, as you say.

919
01:03:10,585 --> 01:03:12,075
As you say.

920
01:03:12,253 --> 01:03:14,380
Pardon me.
Certainly it was I who said so...

921
01:03:14,556 --> 01:03:18,185
...but of course, naturally you think so.
- I think?

922
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,851
All we think here is how to live.

923
01:03:21,329 --> 01:03:22,853
Good health, Jacques.

924
01:03:23,031 --> 01:03:25,192
My name is Ernest De Farge.

925
01:03:25,367 --> 01:03:26,732
De Farge?

926
01:03:27,836 --> 01:03:30,168
Didn't you used to work for Dr. Manette?

927
01:03:30,338 --> 01:03:33,967
- Yes.
- You know, I met him in England.

928
01:03:34,142 --> 01:03:35,871
He has a charming daughter.

929
01:03:36,044 --> 01:03:37,602
Little grandchild now too.

930
01:03:37,779 --> 01:03:39,474
- Grandchild?
- Oh, yes.

931
01:03:39,647 --> 01:03:41,774
His daughter married Charles Darnay.

932
01:03:41,950 --> 01:03:43,281
You must remember him.

933
01:03:43,451 --> 01:03:45,612
He's the nephew
of the Marquis St. Evremonde.

934
01:03:48,757 --> 01:03:50,816
You must have known the marquis.

935
01:03:51,259 --> 01:03:53,625
No. Why should I?

936
01:03:53,795 --> 01:03:57,231
Well, when the marquis was killed
some years ago...

937
01:03:57,399 --> 01:03:59,890
...his death was applauded
in this neighborhood.

938
01:04:00,068 --> 01:04:01,865
You remember that, Jacques?

939
01:04:02,270 --> 01:04:04,670
You make a mistake
when you call my husband Jacques.

940
01:04:04,839 --> 01:04:06,033
His name is Ernest.

941
01:04:06,207 --> 01:04:08,471
I don't want to make
a mistake in your name.

942
01:04:08,643 --> 01:04:11,612
Are there two Ds in Barsad?

943
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:20,883
I don't believe it.
It can't be true...

944
01:04:21,056 --> 01:04:23,149
...what he said of Mademoiselle Manette.
- No.

945
01:04:23,324 --> 01:04:25,292
If he has said it, it's probably false...

946
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:27,928
...but it may be true.
- No, no, it's not true.

947
01:04:28,096 --> 01:04:32,226
If it is, I hope for her sake that destiny
will keep her husband out of France.

948
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,460
Her husband's destiny will lead him
to the end that is to end him.

949
01:04:35,637 --> 01:04:38,105
- That is to end him.
- I can't understand the doctor...

950
01:04:38,273 --> 01:04:41,299
...permitting such a marriage.
- Or forgetting what the Evremondes did.

951
01:04:41,476 --> 01:04:44,639
The doctor may forget,
and the doctor may forgive, but I don't.

952
01:04:45,346 --> 01:04:46,335
We don't.

953
01:04:47,048 --> 01:04:49,312
I don't believe there will be
a terror in France.

954
01:04:49,484 --> 01:04:51,679
I count on the people's sanity
and good temper.

955
01:04:51,853 --> 01:04:55,152
Well, the trouble is,
the aristocrats weren't firm enough.

956
01:04:55,323 --> 01:04:58,588
They should hang hoodlums and that's all
the revolution there will be.

957
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:01,752
That's the kind of talk that cost us
the American colonies.

958
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:03,727
No comparison at all that I can see.

959
01:05:03,898 --> 01:05:08,267
None. We lost the colonies because they fell
under the spell of that upstart Washington.

960
01:05:08,436 --> 01:05:10,927
Well, the time may come
when the upstart Washington...

961
01:05:11,106 --> 01:05:14,075
...will be a better remembered
Englishman than George III.

962
01:05:14,242 --> 01:05:15,971
Oh, stuff and nonsense.

963
01:05:16,144 --> 01:05:20,240
You businessmen never read anything
but your ledgers. You're badly informed.

964
01:05:20,415 --> 01:05:23,407
- Oh, bless my soul.
- And as for the French aristocrats...

965
01:05:23,585 --> 01:05:27,180
...they're so blind they can't see
the lightning in front of their eyes.

966
01:05:27,355 --> 01:05:30,688
You mustn't make the mistake of thinking
that all aristocrats are alike.

967
01:05:30,859 --> 01:05:33,123
- They differ as other classes do.
- I agree.

968
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:40,591
