3
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:48,247
Wow,
look at that big blue ocean.

4
00:00:48,247 --> 00:00:49,515
How does it feel, Dave,

5
00:00:49,515 --> 00:00:52,584
to see the Pacific Ocean
for the first time?

6
00:01:21,146 --> 00:01:22,548
When did you
get this tattoo?

7
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,385
It's your last chance
to play the truth game.

8
00:01:28,854 --> 00:01:31,390
You know what we should do? 

9
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:32,791
Play the truth game
tomorrow.

10
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:34,793
Oh, my God.

11
00:01:34,793 --> 00:01:37,729
Do you promise that you will?
- Oh, I promise.

12
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:49,808
Dave?

13
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:53,245
Dave?

14
00:01:53,245 --> 00:01:54,513
Dave?

15
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:58,250
Why do you always leave me
in the dark, alone?

16
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:02,254
I'm sorry, baby,
I was just taking a photo.

17
00:02:02,254 --> 00:02:03,455
Come here, I'm scared. Okay,
I'm here now, it's okay.

18
00:02:03,455 --> 00:02:05,491
Don't do that.
I won't.

19
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:14,333
Ugh, ew, gross.

20
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,668
I don't like bugs.

21
00:02:16,668 --> 00:02:18,871
I don't know why you
have to put on boots

22
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:21,340
every single time
you see a spider.

23
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,711
It's day two
of our California vacation.

24
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:27,779
And today we're going to

25
00:02:27,779 --> 00:02:29,281
tell each other three truths,

26
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:31,450
that we've never
told each other before.

27
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,352
I'm not doing it.

28
00:02:33,352 --> 00:02:35,454
Come on, you promised,
I'll go first.

29
00:02:35,454 --> 00:02:37,689
Dave...

30
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:40,959
I hate the New York Knicks.
- What?

31
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,394
No, you don't.

32
00:02:42,394 --> 00:02:43,929
I do.

33
00:02:43,929 --> 00:02:46,665
Years, we've been watching
Knicks games together

34
00:02:46,665 --> 00:02:49,868
and suddenly
now you tell me...

35
00:02:49,868 --> 00:02:52,838
It's your turn.

36
00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:54,973
I don't like that butterfly
tattoo on your ass.

37
00:02:54,973 --> 00:02:56,875
You are such a jerk!

38
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:59,645
You've kissed it
a million times.

39
00:02:59,645 --> 00:03:00,879
By accident.

40
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,650
That is not fair,
I was 17 and drunk.

41
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,920
You've done lots of stupid things,
you just...

42
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,722
don't have a mark
on your ass to prove it.

43
00:03:10,722 --> 00:03:12,524
See, this is dangerous!

44
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:16,929
No, no.

45
00:03:16,929 --> 00:03:18,697
No what?
No more.

46
00:03:18,697 --> 00:03:20,499
What do you mean
no more... why?

47
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:22,401
Because you've
eaten that entire bag.

48
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:24,403
Here, I'll split half of this
chocolate bar with you.

49
00:03:24,403 --> 00:03:26,805
So you're doing me a favor
by eating half of it?

50
00:03:26,805 --> 00:03:28,874
Remember that, remember that,
for when we get married...

51
00:03:28,874 --> 00:03:29,741
By keeping the chips
that I did want.

52
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:31,877
Fat husband, kind wife.

53
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,063
That is a very large knife
that you are holding.

54
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:52,864
The guy at the store said
it was the largest knife

55
00:03:52,864 --> 00:03:54,900
you could fold up
and put in your pocket.

56
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,868
I'll just
hold on to it.

57
00:03:56,868 --> 00:03:59,538
You ready for number two?
Sure.

58
00:03:59,538 --> 00:04:01,373
I don't like that

59
00:04:01,373 --> 00:04:03,141
you don't ever stick up for me
in front of your friends.

60
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,777
What are you
talking about?

61
00:04:05,777 --> 00:04:06,945
You don't, come on.

62
00:04:06,945 --> 00:04:08,647
Yes, I do.
No, you don't.

63
00:04:08,647 --> 00:04:09,948
Yes, I do. And I
always stick up for you.

64
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,784
My turn.

65
00:04:12,784 --> 00:04:15,454
I don't think that you think
I'm good at what I do.

66
00:04:15,454 --> 00:04:16,788
What?

67
00:04:16,788 --> 00:04:18,390
I think you're
very good at what you do.

68
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,292
I think you can
try harder

69
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:22,828
but I think you're good at what
you do.

70
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:24,563
That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

71
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,066
Christy.

72
00:04:28,066 --> 00:04:29,568
We're not
gonna be late.

73
00:04:29,568 --> 00:04:31,737
We're not gonna be late,
Christy.

74
00:04:31,737 --> 00:04:33,405
See that?

75
00:04:33,405 --> 00:04:35,107
You're sister's right.

76
00:04:35,107 --> 00:04:36,942
That's me sticking up for
you. Thank you, thank you.

77
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:38,810
Yeah.
Yeah, that's nice.

78
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,112
Yep, okay, bye.

79
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:42,814
We made it through
one and two.

80
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,018
Give me three.

81
00:04:46,018 --> 00:04:48,920
Come on. Hmm, I don't wanna
play this game anymore.

82
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,622
Please?

83
00:04:50,622 --> 00:04:51,890
We still have to get through
dinner with your sister.

84
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:54,993
What's wrong?

85
00:04:54,993 --> 00:04:56,395
Something
just hit me.

86
00:04:56,395 --> 00:04:57,596
What?

87
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:08,994
Fuck, fuck.

88
00:07:12,497 --> 00:07:14,800
 911,
what's your emergency?

89
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,068
Me and my girlfriend
are being abducted.

90
00:07:17,068 --> 00:07:19,604
<i>I'm escaping right now.
What is your name, sir?</i>

91
00:07:19,604 --> 00:07:20,939
Dave Roberts
and Jessica Marino.

92
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:22,274
<i>Where is your location,</i>

93
00:07:22,274 --> 00:07:23,875
<i>starting with
your street name?</i>

94
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:26,778
I don't have a street name,
I'm on a trail.

95
00:07:26,778 --> 00:07:28,947
<i>Can you track me? Are
you in immediate danger?</i>

96
00:07:28,947 --> 00:07:31,183
Yes, just get to
Mount Hollywood,

97
00:07:31,183 --> 00:07:33,952
that's where they got my
girlfriend right now.

98
00:07:33,952 --> 00:07:36,888
Sir, sir, hello?

99
00:07:36,888 --> 00:07:38,623
I think I just heard them,
I have to go.

100
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,707
I'm still on the trail,
can you track me or not?

101
00:07:55,707 --> 00:07:57,943
Can you track me or not
... hello?

102
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,289
Sir, hello?

103
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:12,858
Have you located me yet?

104
00:08:12,858 --> 00:08:14,626
<i>Yes, now we have you.</i>

105
00:08:14,626 --> 00:08:16,127
<i>You're on the south side
of the mountain.</i>

106
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,863
<i>Keep heading
towards the Observatory.</i>

107
00:08:17,863 --> 00:08:19,664
<i>I'm dispatching
a patrol car.</i>

108
00:08:19,664 --> 00:08:20,866
Okay.

109
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,669
<i>Keep this line open.</i>

110
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:35,881
Stop, stop, help me!

111
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,877
Dave?

112
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:19,077
Dave?

113
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,382
Dave, is that you?

114
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,455
Who are you?

115
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,093
Can you say something?

116
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,484
You all right?

117
00:12:32,484 --> 00:12:34,586
Are you hurt?

118
00:12:34,586 --> 00:12:36,154
I'm okay.

119
00:12:36,154 --> 00:12:38,123
What did you see?

120
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:43,161
Um, I just remember getting
shot and I woke up here.

121
00:12:43,161 --> 00:12:45,296
What happened to you?
The same.

122
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,033
Dave, who would
do this to us?

123
00:12:49,033 --> 00:12:51,469
I don't know,
I have no idea.

124
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:56,407
I'm scared, I'm really
scared. I know, I know.

125
00:12:56,407 --> 00:12:59,410
But at least we're
together. Yeah.

126
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,045
It's me and you.

127
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,219
Hello!

128
00:13:13,424 --> 00:13:14,674
No...

129
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:23,067
No, please.
It's okay.

130
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:24,269
It's okay,
we're just gonna take

131
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:26,337
this one breath at
a time, okay?

132
00:13:26,337 --> 00:13:28,439
Just one
breath at a time.

133
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:30,074
Okay, okay.

134
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,313
Breathing's good.

135
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,917
I'm gonna go walk around
and see what's here.

136
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:41,920
You stay put, okay?

137
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,321
I wanna know where
you're at, at all times.

138
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:46,057
Okay.

139
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,585
I just bumped
into something.

140
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:16,387
It's a toilet.

141
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,597
This feels
like a bench.

142
00:14:25,597 --> 00:14:27,232
It's bolted down,
it won't move.

143
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:34,072
Fuck, this is a...

144
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:35,373
this is a mattress.

145
00:14:44,215 --> 00:14:45,483
A sink.

146
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,119
A light switch.

147
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:51,756
We're in some
kind of prison cell.

148
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,093
It's my fucking father.

149
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,197
You don't know that.

150
00:14:59,197 --> 00:15:01,132
Come on,
my father's position.

151
00:15:11,442 --> 00:15:12,677
Hold on to me
tight, Jess.

152
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:22,654
Something's got me!

153
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,323
Don't breathe.

154
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,226
Don't breathe, Jess.

155
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,208
Oh, my God.

156
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:47,378
Dave, Dave... Dave!

157
00:15:47,378 --> 00:15:50,214
Dave, wake up, look,
our hands are free, look.

158
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:56,187
Are you hurt?

159
00:15:56,187 --> 00:15:57,455
Are you okay?

160
00:15:59,757 --> 00:16:01,559
What grabbed you?

161
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,164
I don't know,
it was like a...

162
00:16:06,164 --> 00:16:07,532
metal vice grip.

163
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,628
What's going on?

164
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,231
Who are you?

165
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,737
It's food.

166
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:51,576
That's why there's
this gap here.

167
00:16:51,576 --> 00:16:53,544
So they can slide this
under like we're in a cage.

168
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,048
What are we,
lab rats?

169
00:16:57,048 --> 00:16:58,816
It could be poison.

170
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,187
Why go to the trouble
of poisoning us

171
00:17:03,187 --> 00:17:04,555
if they
could just kill us?

172
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:36,687
It's probably...
cement up there.

173
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:40,792
There's a security camera.

174
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,371
What does that mean?

175
00:17:57,811 --> 00:18:00,411
<i>What do you want
from us, who are you?</i>

176
00:18:00,411 --> 00:18:02,480
If this is about Jessica's
father, she hates him.

177
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,585
Come out!

178
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:26,804
Dave, Dave,
are you okay?

179
00:18:26,804 --> 00:18:28,473
Are you okay, what happened?

180
00:18:28,473 --> 00:18:30,241
What happened...
are you okay?

181
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:39,684
Oh, my God,
it's our clothes.

182
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,721
My phone.

183
00:18:43,721 --> 00:18:46,324
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

184
00:18:46,324 --> 00:18:48,593
Oh my God,
I've got full power.

185
00:18:48,593 --> 00:18:50,261
Oh, please, please, please,
please.

186
00:18:50,261 --> 00:18:51,796
Please, come on,
come on, come on.

187
00:18:53,264 --> 00:18:54,866
I have full reception.

188
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,706
Phones yes, but...

189
00:19:01,706 --> 00:19:03,541
knife, no.

190
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:07,712
That figures.

191
00:19:07,712 --> 00:19:08,913
Why would they
give us our phones

192
00:19:08,913 --> 00:19:10,448
if our phones actually
worked?

193
00:19:10,448 --> 00:19:11,716
They gave me my watch.

194
00:19:11,716 --> 00:19:12,884
All my apps
are wiped out too.

195
00:19:12,884 --> 00:19:14,619
And a chocolate bar.

196
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:16,787
I don't even have date
and time on the screen.

197
00:19:16,787 --> 00:19:18,789
And one stick of gum.

198
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:20,324
And my nail polish.

199
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:45,516
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

200
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:06,537
Here we are, at the beginning
of our vacation,

201
00:20:06,537 --> 00:20:09,240
abducted in LA.

202
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,709
We don't know
why we're here.

203
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:13,411
And we don't know
who abducted us.

204
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:17,848
And this could be
the last proclamation

205
00:20:17,848 --> 00:20:20,585
of what's happening to us.

206
00:20:20,585 --> 00:20:22,920
We were kidnapped right
out of Griffith Park,

207
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,989
and just
placed in this cell

208
00:20:24,989 --> 00:20:27,658
and our only contact has been
with someone

209
00:20:27,658 --> 00:20:30,695
who uses these
metal pincers to grab us

210
00:20:30,695 --> 00:20:33,598
like we're fucking
wild animals.

211
00:20:33,598 --> 00:20:37,268
And there's
this weird wheezing sound

212
00:20:37,268 --> 00:20:39,003
every time they come around.

213
00:20:39,003 --> 00:20:40,838
They gave us
our phones back

214
00:20:40,838 --> 00:20:43,074
and there's no reception...
it's fucking creepy.

215
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,746
And they're watching our every
move on a security camera.

216
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:51,616
I'm scared shitless.

217
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:15,706
Where are you going?

218
00:21:15,706 --> 00:21:17,141
I'm going to flash them.

219
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,122
Dave?

220
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:09,493
Dave?!

221
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:37,221
It's day two
and Dave is gone.

222
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:41,158
I've been passed out
for 12 hours

223
00:22:41,158 --> 00:22:44,562
and, uh,
I'm officially freaking out.

224
00:22:44,562 --> 00:22:48,165
There's this thing on the top
of my spine.

225
00:22:48,165 --> 00:22:50,167
I'm gonna use
the camera to record it now.

226
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:02,580
I feel stuffed but I haven't
eaten anything.

227
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,181
I want Dave.

228
00:23:04,181 --> 00:23:06,250
Please come back, Dave,
please come back, Dave.

229
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,748
Come on, come on.

230
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:47,258
Fuck!

231
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:02,072
<i>It's day four.</i>

232
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,909
<i>There's still no Dave.</i>

233
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,949
<i>That fucking light is going to
drive me insane.</i>

234
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:18,088
I just... I don't...
I don't understand how

235
00:24:18,088 --> 00:24:19,623
kidnapping me and Dave

236
00:24:19,623 --> 00:24:21,225
is going to
change the world.

237
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:45,216
Yeah, yeah?

238
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:52,857
<i>Something's happening
inside my body.</i>

239
00:24:52,857 --> 00:24:56,026
Like my hormones are changing.

240
00:24:56,026 --> 00:24:57,995
<i>Maybe it's getting off
the pill, I don't know.</i>

241
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:05,870
<i>Come on, just give me
something.</i>

242
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:20,230
Dave.

243
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:45,589
Hello?

244
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,607
Are you okay?

245
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:06,016
Oh, no!

246
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:11,181
Ahh, get off of me!

247
00:29:15,788 --> 00:29:17,488
Get off of me!

248
00:29:17,488 --> 00:29:20,057
Get off of me!

249
00:29:20,057 --> 00:29:21,391
Get off!

250
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:30,033
Please!

251
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:36,607
Please,
I don't wanna die!

252
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:49,453
Jessica?

253
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:58,962
Are you okay? I woke
up in a hospital room.

254
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:02,065
There was a-- there was a dead
abductor on the ground.

255
00:30:02,065 --> 00:30:03,333
I tried to escape.

256
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:07,004
I saw--
I saw a news webpage,

257
00:30:07,004 --> 00:30:08,272
and there were pictures,

258
00:30:08,272 --> 00:30:09,473
our pictures were next
to pictures

259
00:30:09,473 --> 00:30:11,942
of my dad
in Afghanistan.

260
00:30:11,942 --> 00:30:14,077
It has to be the Taliban.

261
00:30:14,077 --> 00:30:15,379
Fuck, you were right.

262
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:17,915
Oh my God.

263
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:35,465
It's day five.

264
00:30:35,465 --> 00:30:37,601
It is the Taliban.

265
00:30:37,601 --> 00:30:39,303
I escaped and I saw
a news headline

266
00:30:39,303 --> 00:30:40,604
and Dave
found an ear.

267
00:30:40,604 --> 00:30:42,372
So that backs it up.

268
00:30:42,372 --> 00:30:44,274
It's probably some sort of
sleeper cell

269
00:30:44,274 --> 00:30:46,510
that's been in
the U.S. for a while.

270
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:51,949
<i>And I found
this little kid.</i>

271
00:30:51,949 --> 00:30:53,350
<i>They kidnapped a kid.</i>

272
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:55,219
<i>She was 10,
12 years old.</i>

273
00:30:55,219 --> 00:30:57,521
<i>It's so creepy.</i>

274
00:30:57,521 --> 00:30:59,389
<i>A kid?</i>

275
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:04,027
And Dave has that same wound
on the back of his neck.

276
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:10,200
We both have needle marks
on our arms, it's fucked.

277
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:13,003
<i>I tried a protein bar.</i>

278
00:31:13,003 --> 00:31:14,304
<i>You ate
the rat pellets?</i>

279
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:17,307
That or starve.

280
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:21,211
<i>They turned the lights on.</i>

281
00:31:21,211 --> 00:31:23,547
<i>Yeah, now we can see what
a shithole we're in.</i>

282
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,077
Do you hear that breathing?

283
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,021
Hello?

284
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:07,424
Who the fuck are you?

285
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:11,695
Please don't hurt us.

286
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:14,398
Who are you?

287
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:15,718
I'm Justin.

288
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,536
Summer.

289
00:32:19,536 --> 00:32:20,737
Who kidnapped you?

290
00:32:20,737 --> 00:32:23,273
I-- I don't... know.

291
00:32:27,644 --> 00:32:29,046
My name's Dave.

292
00:32:29,046 --> 00:32:30,314
This is my girlfriend,
Jessica.

293
00:32:32,649 --> 00:32:34,551
We we're kidnapped
in Griffith Park.

294
00:32:34,551 --> 00:32:37,454
Summer,
this is my fault.

295
00:32:37,454 --> 00:32:40,057
We knew four people were
already missing from the park

296
00:32:40,057 --> 00:32:42,492
and-- and we walked right
by the poster,

297
00:32:42,492 --> 00:32:44,061
and now we're here.

298
00:32:44,061 --> 00:32:46,563
I'm so sorry,
I'm sorry.

299
00:32:46,563 --> 00:32:48,131
Four people?
Posters?

300
00:32:48,131 --> 00:32:49,333
What did the posters say?

301
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:50,600
We... we didn't
look at it.

302
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,169
I read online that

303
00:32:52,169 --> 00:32:54,471
the police were using
blood hounds in the park,

304
00:32:54,471 --> 00:32:57,174
and all they ended up finding
was a Flip cam.

305
00:32:57,174 --> 00:32:58,642
My Flip camera.

306
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:03,580
That means the cops
must have a good lead.

307
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,649
There wasn't any
talk about hostages,

308
00:33:05,649 --> 00:33:09,019
or... or... or ransom notes
from the Taliban?

309
00:33:09,019 --> 00:33:09,769
No.

310
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:11,588
Did you see them?

311
00:33:11,588 --> 00:33:12,338
No.

312
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:14,391
Here.

313
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,630
Here, put this on, wrap it
around like a skirt.

314
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:22,265
It'll make
you feel better.

315
00:33:22,265 --> 00:33:24,301
The rest of your clothes
should come soon...

316
00:33:24,301 --> 00:33:26,503
part of their procedure

317
00:33:26,503 --> 00:33:30,107
to strip you down, and make
you huddle in the dark.

318
00:33:30,107 --> 00:33:32,109
How old are you two?
18.

319
00:33:32,109 --> 00:33:33,643
When were you
guys kidnapped?

320
00:33:33,643 --> 00:33:37,714
Saturday,
around 7:00 p.m.

321
00:33:37,714 --> 00:33:39,449
What time is it now?

322
00:33:39,449 --> 00:33:41,051
Um, I think by
our calculations

323
00:33:41,051 --> 00:33:43,653
it should probably be about
Sunday morning.

324
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:48,959
We've been joined
by two new victims,

325
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:51,728
Justin and Summer,

326
00:33:51,728 --> 00:33:55,198
who also have no idea why
they've been abducted.

327
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:59,536
Do you two have
any military connections?

328
00:33:59,536 --> 00:34:00,786
What?

329
00:34:01,807 --> 00:34:05,509
Any reason why
the Taliban would kidnap you?

330
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:06,810
No.

331
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,815
Justin...
it's your mom and dad.

332
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:15,986
Hey, okay, is this
like a boot camp,

333
00:34:15,986 --> 00:34:19,056
like... like
some kind of intervention?

334
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:20,724
I don't think so.

335
00:34:20,724 --> 00:34:22,492
'Cause they found
some pot in Justin's room

336
00:34:22,492 --> 00:34:23,827
and they threatened to
send him away.

337
00:34:23,827 --> 00:34:27,697
I mean...
it's gotta be it.

338
00:34:27,697 --> 00:34:29,800
Believe me,
this is not a boot camp.

339
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:33,770
Are either of your
parents rich?

340
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:38,175
Justin's father
is Jerry Weiner,

341
00:34:38,175 --> 00:34:41,044
you know, the big movie
producer?

342
00:34:41,044 --> 00:34:44,514
Maybe this is
about ransoms?

343
00:34:44,514 --> 00:34:46,550
Yeah, we found this
little girl.

344
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:49,119
I mean, maybe
she's being held, too.

345
00:34:52,224 --> 00:34:54,791
<i>Okay, Justin...</i>

346
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,470
Dave?

347
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:26,511
Hello?

348
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:29,593
Summer?

349
00:35:29,593 --> 00:35:30,861
Oh, fuck.

350
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,580
Where is Dave?

351
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:33,723
What are you doing?

352
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:37,861
What are you doing?

353
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:42,199
No!

354
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:43,519
No, no, no!

355
00:36:46,138 --> 00:36:48,872
No, no, no!

356
00:36:48,872 --> 00:36:50,273
Fuck you, no!

357
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:56,246
No, no, no,
no, no, no!

358
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:55,038
Are you okay?

359
00:37:55,038 --> 00:37:57,941
Hey, what happened?

360
00:37:59,776 --> 00:38:02,779
What is that?
Don't-- don't touch.

361
00:38:02,779 --> 00:38:05,115
What is it?
Don't touch it.

362
00:38:05,115 --> 00:38:07,050
Can I look?
It hurts.

363
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,987
Oh, my God.

364
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:17,227
Oh, my God.

365
00:38:17,227 --> 00:38:20,230
What did they do?

366
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:22,332
What, did they
take out your kidney?

367
00:38:22,332 --> 00:38:24,768
What is that?
Fuck!

368
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:27,437
Just take our
fucking body parts one by one,

369
00:38:27,437 --> 00:38:30,840
sell it off to the highest
bidder?

370
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,676
They look like fucking
metal staples.

371
00:38:32,676 --> 00:38:33,396
Jesus.

372
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,982
It's okay, you're fine,
you're okay, you're okay.

373
00:38:52,429 --> 00:38:55,098
Wow... the first ones.

374
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:59,135
What?

375
00:38:59,135 --> 00:39:01,871
Your 9-1-1 call got a lot of
people down to Griffith Park

376
00:39:01,871 --> 00:39:05,008
hoping to be
the chosen ones.

377
00:39:05,008 --> 00:39:07,277
What the fuck are you
talking about?

378
00:39:07,277 --> 00:39:09,779
We wanted to get abducted.

379
00:39:09,779 --> 00:39:10,779
Why?

380
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:14,317
You don't know
who abducted you?

381
00:39:14,317 --> 00:39:16,386
No, do you?

382
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,290
They're aliens.

383
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,227
They're not
fucking aliens.

384
00:39:24,227 --> 00:39:26,296
You got a scar?

385
00:39:26,296 --> 00:39:28,231
Yeah.
Aliens.

386
00:39:28,231 --> 00:39:30,900
I got mine a couple
of days ago!

387
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,836
They entered
your body, right?

388
00:39:32,836 --> 00:39:35,805
I can feel a worm, crawling
around inside me.

389
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:40,276
I don't feel anything inside me,
so I don't buy it.

390
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:47,350
<i>Hello, I'm Elliot.</i>

391
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:50,153
<i>That's Maria,
she's totally freaked out.</i>

392
00:39:50,153 --> 00:39:52,489
She's writing her dissertation
on alien abductions.

393
00:39:52,489 --> 00:39:56,326
But now that it's happened,
she's comatose.

394
00:39:56,326 --> 00:39:57,527
They're abducting couples

395
00:39:57,527 --> 00:40:00,330
to repopulate Earth
with human aliens.

396
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:03,166
I guess we should be
rejoicing, huh, Dave?

397
00:40:03,166 --> 00:40:05,168
I mean, if it's gonna be between
aliens and the Taliban,

398
00:40:05,168 --> 00:40:07,070
I'd take
aliens any day.

399
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:08,438
You guys are insane.

400
00:40:08,438 --> 00:40:10,440
I'm a Harvard
PhD'er with degrees

401
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,909
in Physics and Philosophy
with an IQ rated

402
00:40:12,909 --> 00:40:16,045
in the top percentile
of the human population.

403
00:40:16,045 --> 00:40:19,182
Maria believes that's
why the nabbed us,

404
00:40:19,182 --> 00:40:22,485
and, we're not
even a couple.

405
00:40:22,485 --> 00:40:24,354
That doesn't
make any sense.

406
00:40:24,354 --> 00:40:26,289
I mean, why take
Jessica and me?

407
00:40:26,289 --> 00:40:27,524
We're regular people.

408
00:40:27,524 --> 00:40:29,259
Males
are the chosen ones.

409
00:40:29,259 --> 00:40:31,261
Females are
the egg farm.

410
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:33,963
Got it.

411
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,200
Did the aliens send you

412
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,136
to put out their message,
to be the Messiah?

413
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:44,507
I don't believe in
any of this alien crap.

414
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:48,445
Have as many as you want.

415
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:51,414
They're running experiments

416
00:40:51,414 --> 00:40:53,516
to determine our
body status for future use,

417
00:40:53,516 --> 00:40:57,287
controlling exactly what we eat,
so I say eat.

418
00:40:57,287 --> 00:40:58,555
In the blue room

419
00:40:58,555 --> 00:41:01,224
I saw something
that said Nevada five,

420
00:41:01,224 --> 00:41:04,060
Jeff Miller, RIP, 2009.

421
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,062
Yep, Miller,
he's on our list.

422
00:41:06,062 --> 00:41:07,997
The count was up to nine
in Nevada,

423
00:41:07,997 --> 00:41:09,966
12 in Boston,
six in New York.

424
00:41:09,966 --> 00:41:12,435
In that same room
I found an ear.

425
00:41:12,435 --> 00:41:15,138
Seems to be a bit
more of a ransom move.

426
00:41:15,138 --> 00:41:18,174
Think that Getty kid back
in the '70s.

427
00:41:18,174 --> 00:41:20,510
They're running transfusions
through our kidneys.

428
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:21,911
Think about it.

429
00:41:21,911 --> 00:41:24,547
Elliot,
you're full of shit!

430
00:41:24,547 --> 00:41:26,282
Where's the proof?

431
00:41:26,282 --> 00:41:28,084
Not once have I seen
one alien gadget

432
00:41:28,084 --> 00:41:30,920
that can't be bought here on
"off the shelf" planet earth.

433
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,456
Here's why, if the FBI ever
captures one,

434
00:41:33,456 --> 00:41:35,158
there won't be
anything to positively

435
00:41:35,158 --> 00:41:39,095
identify them as alien,
no smoking ray-guns.

436
00:41:39,095 --> 00:41:40,630
That's your proof?

437
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:43,366
No proof
is your proof?

438
00:41:43,366 --> 00:41:45,468
Are you saying that we're
like Adam and Eve?

439
00:41:45,468 --> 00:41:46,970
That's exactly
what he's saying,

440
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:48,271
they're rounding up
a new herd,

441
00:41:48,271 --> 00:41:49,639
taking us two-by-two,

442
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:51,708
walking us up the plank to
the alien fucking ark.

443
00:41:56,946 --> 00:42:00,183
Aliens, no need to gas us,
we're on your side.

444
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,538
One time we're gonna
get gassed and not wake up.

445
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:25,441
If we die,

446
00:42:25,441 --> 00:42:26,709
I just don't
wanna die alone.

447
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:31,347
That's why you got me.

448
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:35,652
Let's get married...
right now.

449
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:38,388
It's too sad.

450
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:42,992
No, it's not.

451
00:42:42,992 --> 00:42:45,328
I'll record it...

452
00:42:45,328 --> 00:42:46,763
and we can still
have a wedding video.

453
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:50,883
So...

454
00:42:52,037 --> 00:42:54,571
<i>in case we miss our
future wedding,</i>

455
00:42:54,571 --> 00:42:58,174
do you, Jessica Marino,

456
00:42:58,174 --> 00:43:01,277
take me, Dave Roberts,

457
00:43:01,277 --> 00:43:03,780
to be your lawfully wedded
husband?

458
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:06,583
<i>I do.</i>

459
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:12,088
Do you, Dave Roberts...

460
00:43:12,088 --> 00:43:14,457
take Jessica Marino

461
00:43:14,457 --> 00:43:16,526
<i>to be your
lawfully wedded wife?</i>

462
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:20,263
<i>I do.</i>

463
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:25,568
By the power vested in me,

464
00:43:25,568 --> 00:43:28,972
in the middle
of this cell,

465
00:43:28,972 --> 00:43:31,541
<i>I now pronounce us...</i>

466
00:43:31,541 --> 00:43:33,376
husband and wife.

467
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:37,380
You may kiss
the bride.

468
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,604
Day seven.

469
00:44:01,604 --> 00:44:03,439
<i>I read a book
on prison once</i>

470
00:44:03,439 --> 00:44:05,141
<i>by the French writer
Albert Camus.</i>

471
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:08,645
And he goes through

472
00:44:08,645 --> 00:44:11,581
the four stages of how to
break down a prisoner.

473
00:44:11,581 --> 00:44:15,485
One, you strip
them of everything.

474
00:44:15,485 --> 00:44:17,787
Two, you make them grovel

475
00:44:17,787 --> 00:44:21,424
<i>for the most basic
human fucking needs.</i>

476
00:44:21,424 --> 00:44:23,292
Three, you confuse

477
00:44:23,292 --> 00:44:25,261
the ever-living
fuck out of them

478
00:44:25,261 --> 00:44:27,497
by unexplainable changes
in their routine,

479
00:44:27,497 --> 00:44:31,034
shuffling
prisoners in and out.

480
00:44:31,034 --> 00:44:32,502
And then you follow that up

481
00:44:32,502 --> 00:44:37,340
with long, long, long lonely
periods of isolation.

482
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:42,345
Well, you fucking
forgot one thing, Camus,

483
00:44:42,345 --> 00:44:45,381
the fucking, freaking,
goddamned red light!

484
00:44:45,381 --> 00:44:46,616
That helps!

485
00:44:46,616 --> 00:44:49,519
That fucking helps!

486
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:51,621
Come out!

487
00:44:51,621 --> 00:44:53,356
Come the fuck out!

488
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,361
Come on!

489
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,130
Is this funny for you?

490
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:04,300
Fucking laugh at!

491
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:07,370
Come on, I'll tear this
whole fucking place apart!

492
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:08,638
Come on!

493
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:16,646
It's gas,
cover your mouth.

494
00:45:16,646 --> 00:45:18,214
Cover your mouth!

495
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:20,717
Get ready to run.

496
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:34,430
Run!

497
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:42,505
Get the light!

498
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,859
Let's go.

499
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:09,365
Fuck.

500
00:46:12,803 --> 00:46:14,270
There's a kid!

501
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:28,535
No!

502
00:46:30,255 --> 00:46:31,521
Fuck!

503
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:36,893
Fuck!

504
00:46:41,764 --> 00:46:43,332
Who the hell are you?

505
00:46:43,332 --> 00:46:44,634
We're getting
out of here.

506
00:46:44,634 --> 00:46:46,502
Shit yeah, come on,
Tiffany, get your stuff.

507
00:46:46,502 --> 00:46:47,770
Oh, my God!

508
00:46:50,306 --> 00:46:51,974
Get back, get back!

509
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:55,411
Stop it!

510
00:46:55,411 --> 00:46:57,547
Please, stop,
you're going to kill him!

511
00:46:57,547 --> 00:46:58,748
Stop it!

512
00:46:58,748 --> 00:47:00,383
Stop it!

513
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,567
You okay?

514
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:24,440
What up?

515
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,275
You all right, man?

516
00:47:26,275 --> 00:47:27,844
What the fuck?

517
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,548
Buzz, it's Dave,
from Griffith Park 8.

518
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:36,752
There's eight
of us now?

519
00:47:36,752 --> 00:47:38,321
He has no idea
what's going on.

520
00:47:38,321 --> 00:47:40,356
Shut up, Tiffany,
the guy's hurting.

521
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,693
Look, Buzz,
he has the same scar as you.

522
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:49,298
Watch it, watch it.

523
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:53,636
Fucker Tased me
right in the wound.

524
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,807
It's Dave and Jessica,
right?

525
00:47:57,807 --> 00:47:59,508
What do you know?

526
00:47:59,508 --> 00:48:03,379
Hey, man, shh,
they're watching.

527
00:48:03,379 --> 00:48:04,714
Yeah.

528
00:48:04,714 --> 00:48:06,515
Is it the Taliban?

529
00:48:08,484 --> 00:48:12,488
Listen, I can get
on the Internet,

530
00:48:12,488 --> 00:48:15,658
not now,
sometimes late at night.

531
00:48:15,658 --> 00:48:16,893
What?

532
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:18,327
Our phones don't work.

533
00:48:18,327 --> 00:48:19,629
Your phone sucks.

534
00:48:19,629 --> 00:48:21,497
This thing
is the shit.

535
00:48:21,497 --> 00:48:23,933
They don't seem to care that
I can get on the Internet.

536
00:48:23,933 --> 00:48:26,903
I mean, what
difference does it make?

537
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:29,839
It's not like I can tell anyone
where we are, can I?

538
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:32,842
Can the cops
trace your signal?

539
00:48:32,842 --> 00:48:34,710
Scrambled.

540
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:36,846
This place is
high-tech, man.

541
00:48:36,846 --> 00:48:40,016
Haven't you guys noticed that
your phones never go down?

542
00:48:40,016 --> 00:48:43,486
Tesla's dream,
no wires, no cords.

543
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:48,291
Secret government mojo.

544
00:48:48,291 --> 00:48:49,692
They've been stealing
people off the street

545
00:48:49,692 --> 00:48:52,561
for some secret,
genetic mission.

546
00:48:52,561 --> 00:48:54,363
They're creating
a super-human.

547
00:48:54,363 --> 00:48:57,566
Oh, Christ,
not this shit again.

548
00:48:57,566 --> 00:48:59,535
Dude, it's all on
the Internet.

549
00:48:59,535 --> 00:49:00,970
Those protein bars
you've been eating,

550
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:03,572
full of hormones, doing
weird shit to us.

551
00:49:03,572 --> 00:49:05,975
Like stopping your hair
and nails from growing,

552
00:49:05,975 --> 00:49:07,877
never taking a shit,

553
00:49:07,877 --> 00:49:10,479
turning your pee pink.

554
00:49:10,479 --> 00:49:12,949
It's freaky shit,
man.

555
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:21,057
My beard hasn't
grown in at all.

556
00:49:24,329 --> 00:49:28,965
Yeah, right there,
Griffith Park 8.

557
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:36,005
There's no mention
of a little girl?

558
00:49:36,005 --> 00:49:36,755
No.

559
00:49:37,909 --> 00:49:39,542
Just young couples
in our prime.

560
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:42,878
If they don't care that
he's making connections

561
00:49:42,878 --> 00:49:44,513
to the outside world,

562
00:49:44,513 --> 00:49:47,683
then they don't give a shit
about being caught.

563
00:49:47,683 --> 00:49:49,752
Yeah, problem is,
everyone thinks

564
00:49:49,752 --> 00:49:52,788
my Facebook
updates are a hoax.

565
00:49:52,788 --> 00:49:54,657
The abductors broke
my phone camera

566
00:49:54,657 --> 00:49:56,892
so I can't send pictures.

567
00:49:56,892 --> 00:49:58,160
They know exactly
what they're doing.

568
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:01,097
Well, let me log
into my Facebook.

569
00:50:01,097 --> 00:50:01,847
No.

570
00:50:02,934 --> 00:50:05,935
If we both say the same thing
our our status,

571
00:50:05,935 --> 00:50:08,504
the outside world
might believe it.

572
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:12,908
All right, fine.

573
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:22,551
Okay, here's
what I'm gonna say.

574
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,160
You say
the same thing.

575
00:50:32,561 --> 00:50:33,763
Oh, shit, come on!

576
00:50:33,763 --> 00:50:34,964
What's going on here?!

577
00:50:34,964 --> 00:50:36,165
What are you doing?

578
00:50:36,165 --> 00:50:37,566
Hey, what are you doing?

579
00:50:37,566 --> 00:50:38,834
Stop!

580
00:50:38,834 --> 00:50:40,403
Get back!

581
00:50:56,486 --> 00:50:57,920
No, get off!

582
00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:10,066
Buzz, Buzz,
are you okay?

583
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:13,502
Fuck, that hurt.

584
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:27,716
It's gone.
- What?

585
00:51:27,716 --> 00:51:30,152
They took my phone.

586
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:33,189
Now we're screwed.

587
00:51:33,189 --> 00:51:34,824
You fuck!

588
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:41,597
This is your
fucking fault.

589
00:51:41,597 --> 00:51:43,199
How?

590
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:47,803
You are officially
persona non grata, ass-wipe.

591
00:51:47,803 --> 00:51:49,839
Give me one of
your phones.

592
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:51,107
Fuck you.

593
00:51:51,107 --> 00:51:52,875
Yeah, get
the fuck over there.

594
00:51:52,875 --> 00:51:54,477
I don't wanna see your
ugly face. Stop it!

595
00:51:54,477 --> 00:51:56,045
Please go, please.

596
00:52:06,723 --> 00:52:08,090
Somebody's
gonna find us.

597
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:09,558
Don't cross this line!

598
00:52:09,558 --> 00:52:10,159
Have a little faith.

599
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:17,099
<i>This is my cell,
my domain!</i>

600
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:18,501
<i>You hear me?</i>

601
00:52:18,501 --> 00:52:20,136
There is no room
for anyone else!

602
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:24,273
Okay.

603
00:52:24,273 --> 00:52:26,575
This will
keep us going.

604
00:52:26,575 --> 00:52:29,245
Describe walking into your
favorite place.

605
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:36,752
I'll go first.

606
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:41,757
Getting off the G,

607
00:52:41,757 --> 00:52:43,692
we're walking past
over to the diner,

608
00:52:43,692 --> 00:52:47,062
and smelling
all that greasy food.

609
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:52,768
And then walking up
to that dirty door

610
00:52:52,768 --> 00:52:55,671
that you hate touching,

611
00:52:55,671 --> 00:52:57,673
and running
up the steps...

612
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:03,646
... and unlocking the door
to our apartment.

613
00:53:03,646 --> 00:53:05,614
And Felix is meowing.

614
00:53:08,051 --> 00:53:10,252
Aw, poor Felix.

615
00:53:10,252 --> 00:53:11,720
Yeah.

616
00:53:13,623 --> 00:53:15,658
Poor Felix.

617
00:53:15,658 --> 00:53:19,328
Sitting in
my brothers place,

618
00:53:19,328 --> 00:53:22,131
getting fatter...

619
00:53:22,131 --> 00:53:23,866
and fatter
by the minute.

620
00:53:30,706 --> 00:53:32,007
You little bastard.

621
00:53:32,007 --> 00:53:33,943
Give me one of your phones,
goddamn it.

622
00:53:36,679 --> 00:53:38,147
Buzz,
what are you doing?

623
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:41,250
Get over there!

624
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:44,320
Give it to me
or I'll fucking kill you.

625
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,125
This'll take care
of your ass.

626
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,834
Get off of him!

627
00:53:58,834 --> 00:54:00,202
Give me the phone!
Get off!

628
00:54:00,202 --> 00:54:01,937
Get off, get off!

629
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:34,937
Are you all right?

630
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:53,789
So they're
only jacking couples,

631
00:54:53,789 --> 00:54:54,990
which means that

632
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:57,226
that little girl
isn't a hostage,

633
00:54:57,226 --> 00:54:58,961
she has to
be their kid.

634
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:05,167
Well, if it's not the Taliban
and it's not kidnappers,

635
00:55:05,167 --> 00:55:07,836
sure as shit
ain't the government.

636
00:55:07,836 --> 00:55:09,738
We don't know that.

637
00:55:09,738 --> 00:55:11,740
I mean, think about
what the government did

638
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:14,843
to unsuspecting citizens
in the '50s.

639
00:55:14,843 --> 00:55:19,315
They gave them LSD,
they did nuclear tests.

640
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,085
Yeah.

641
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:32,761
What was your
third truth?

642
00:55:32,761 --> 00:55:34,029
I don't remember.

643
00:55:35,398 --> 00:55:37,866
Wasn't anything
too revealing.

644
00:55:37,866 --> 00:55:39,368
I was not trying to
make you any more mad

645
00:55:39,368 --> 00:55:41,337
than the first two truths
made you.

646
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:43,405
Fine.

647
00:55:43,405 --> 00:55:45,174
I have one since.

648
00:55:45,174 --> 00:55:46,942
Since we've been here?

649
00:55:49,279 --> 00:55:53,816
When we were abducted,
I woke up,

650
00:55:53,816 --> 00:55:57,019
and I looked for you--
we were still on the peak.

651
00:55:57,019 --> 00:55:58,854
And I went running down
the mountainside,

652
00:55:58,854 --> 00:56:00,456
towards the Observatory.

653
00:56:00,456 --> 00:56:01,857
I thought
I'd made it.

654
00:56:01,857 --> 00:56:03,058
I was flagging down
this van.

655
00:56:03,058 --> 00:56:05,127
You just left me?

656
00:56:05,127 --> 00:56:05,877
No.

657
00:56:08,132 --> 00:56:11,367
I was... I was
trying to get us help.

658
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:13,369
I was on the phone
with 911.

659
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:16,905
I was trying to
get us rescued.

660
00:56:16,905 --> 00:56:18,807
Why didn't
you tell me earlier?

661
00:56:18,807 --> 00:56:22,211
When would've been a good time
to tell you that, Jessica?

662
00:56:22,211 --> 00:56:24,279
You're so guilty.

663
00:56:25,448 --> 00:56:26,915
When?

664
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:42,164
Jessica hasn't spoken
to me in hours...

665
00:56:42,164 --> 00:56:43,899
and I'm starting to lose it.

666
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:47,603
Jess, I need you
to talk to me, please.

667
00:56:58,381 --> 00:57:00,115
Jess, where are you?

668
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:03,018
Tell me
where you are.

669
00:57:03,018 --> 00:57:04,253
Dammit, this is not
the fucking time

670
00:57:04,253 --> 00:57:06,021
to be mad
at me, where are you?

671
00:57:18,134 --> 00:57:19,601
(lock latching)

672
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:25,274
Who's there?

673
00:57:29,979 --> 00:57:31,814
Maria?

674
00:57:31,814 --> 00:57:33,081
Where's Elliot?

675
00:57:33,081 --> 00:57:34,283
I don't know.

676
00:58:31,107 --> 00:58:32,441
Jessica?

677
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:35,611
Jessica.

678
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:39,515
We only have each other
right now, please.

679
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:44,186
You just left me.

680
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:49,024
You're a coward.

681
00:58:52,128 --> 00:58:53,962
It wasn't the bravest
thing I've done.

682
00:58:55,398 --> 00:58:57,466
I've never been
in a fight before...

683
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:02,070
... except for in
the third grade, and I lost.

684
00:59:07,477 --> 00:59:09,044
I probably wouldn't
have married you

685
00:59:09,044 --> 00:59:11,046
if you wore wife-beaters.

686
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:13,482
I love you.

687
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:17,286
I love you.

688
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:34,369
Okay, Morris, it's time to
jump through the hoop. Come on.

689
00:59:34,369 --> 00:59:36,038
Come on, Morris.

690
00:59:36,038 --> 00:59:37,339
Come on.

691
00:59:37,339 --> 00:59:39,007
Jump through the hoop,
Morris.

692
00:59:39,007 --> 00:59:40,257
Da-da

693
00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:43,946
Come on, Morris.

694
00:59:43,946 --> 00:59:45,213
Come on,
I feel it.

695
00:59:45,213 --> 00:59:47,416
It's coming, here it is,
here it is.

696
00:59:47,416 --> 00:59:50,185
Oh, come on, you tiny
little alien bug. Yes, yes.

697
00:59:52,121 --> 00:59:53,455
You did it!

698
00:59:53,455 --> 00:59:54,455
Hey!

699
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:57,960
Ahh, Morris,
you're a champ.

700
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,661
You two are
really losing it.

701
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:07,235
That's the first thing
you've said in ten hours.

702
01:00:07,235 --> 01:00:09,538
We're losing it?

703
01:00:09,538 --> 01:00:12,641
I'm studying
UFOs at UCLA.

704
01:00:12,641 --> 01:00:16,144
You can study
UFOs at UCLA?

705
01:00:16,144 --> 01:00:18,480
I saw my first UFO
when I was ten,

706
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:22,084
March 13, 1997,
Phoenix, Arizona,

707
01:00:22,084 --> 01:00:23,652
thousands of people saw it.

708
01:00:23,652 --> 01:00:26,722
For 20 minutes a spaceship
hovered over downtown.

709
01:00:26,722 --> 01:00:28,390
You can look
it up on YouTube.

710
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:34,663
I can't, actually.

711
01:00:34,663 --> 01:00:36,131
Don't you get it?

712
01:00:36,131 --> 01:00:38,100
We're on a spaceship.

713
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:40,769
We're not
on a spaceship.

714
01:00:40,769 --> 01:00:43,505
Why do you think they
wear oxygen masks

715
01:00:43,505 --> 01:00:45,107
when they come in here?

716
01:00:45,107 --> 01:00:47,509
Gassing's been around
since World War I.

717
01:00:47,509 --> 01:00:49,511
Armies going in and gassing
the shit out of the enemies,

718
01:00:49,511 --> 01:00:52,114
using gas masks to protect
themselves.

719
01:00:52,114 --> 01:00:54,149
Which is why
they don't touch us.

720
01:00:54,149 --> 01:00:56,118
Why they use pincers.

721
01:00:56,118 --> 01:00:58,654
To avoid contact
with human viruses.

722
01:00:58,654 --> 01:01:02,591
It's the same thing that
killed off the Aztecs.

723
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:06,361
The avatar's
are here, among us.

724
01:01:06,361 --> 01:01:12,334
That's a really, really...
nice theory, Maria,

725
01:01:12,334 --> 01:01:14,770
but unfortunately,
I don't think it's anything

726
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:18,106
nearly as fun
as that.

727
01:01:18,106 --> 01:01:21,810
I can't find my kidney.

728
01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:23,679
They're harvesting
organs, okay.

729
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:26,348
Do you know how much
money can be made in that?

730
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:34,523
Goodbye, Morris.

731
01:01:34,523 --> 01:01:37,325
This is one small
step for bug

732
01:01:37,325 --> 01:01:40,362
and one giant
leap for "bugkind."

733
01:01:40,362 --> 01:01:42,130
Go out that way.

734
01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:42,880
Go.

735
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:48,370
It was good
meeting you.

736
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:49,771
Don't forget to write.

737
01:02:31,814 --> 01:02:33,849
Maria... wake up.

738
01:02:46,562 --> 01:02:47,929
It's completed.

739
01:02:59,307 --> 01:03:00,642
Come on!

740
01:03:00,642 --> 01:03:01,910
Come on!

741
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:05,480
Where is she, huh?

742
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:09,584
You hear me
down here?

743
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:11,987
You better not hurt her!

744
01:03:13,723 --> 01:03:15,290
You better not
hurt her!

745
01:03:26,669 --> 01:03:28,336
Oh, my God!

746
01:03:28,336 --> 01:03:30,772
Oh, my God-- ow.

747
01:03:30,772 --> 01:03:32,407
It's food,
it's real food.

748
01:03:32,407 --> 01:03:35,811
It's lots and lots of
real food... oh, my God.

749
01:03:37,346 --> 01:03:41,283
Mmm, oh my God,
look at this.

750
01:03:41,283 --> 01:03:45,954
Look at...
oh my God.

751
01:03:45,954 --> 01:03:48,657
Oh my God...
it's so good.

752
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:53,695
It could be poison.

753
01:03:53,695 --> 01:03:56,865
They don't
need us anymore.

754
01:03:56,865 --> 01:03:59,935
They've got plenty
of our eggs.

755
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:03,371
I mean, how many
Jessicas do they need?

756
01:04:05,775 --> 01:04:07,275
I don't know.

757
01:04:07,275 --> 01:04:08,877
I don't
really think about it.

758
01:04:08,877 --> 01:04:11,479
Well, I'm not
touching that stuff.

759
01:04:11,479 --> 01:04:13,481
I'll wait to see
if you croak.

760
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:18,019
Okay,
I'll be your guinea pig.

761
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:24,993
<i>Oh, Morris,
you're going to be a star.</i>

762
01:04:24,993 --> 01:04:26,695
<i>Your name up in lights.</i>

763
01:04:28,998 --> 01:04:31,900
<i>(Jessica) Come on,
come through the hoop.</i>

764
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:34,002
<i>Come on.</i>

765
01:04:34,002 --> 01:04:35,570
<i>He's doing it.</i>

766
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,555
Okay, come on.

767
01:04:54,824 --> 01:04:56,758
Come on,
give me something.

768
01:04:58,427 --> 01:05:00,462
Please, God,
give me something.

769
01:05:01,664 --> 01:05:03,832
Fucking shit.

770
01:05:03,832 --> 01:05:06,768
Please, please, please,
please, please.

771
01:05:09,538 --> 01:05:11,339
Oh my God.

772
01:05:11,339 --> 01:05:14,542
Oh, oh my God,
oh my God, oh my God.

773
01:05:14,542 --> 01:05:16,978
I have bars-- oh my God--
come on.

774
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:21,449
Come on.

775
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:25,754
Please...

776
01:05:25,754 --> 01:05:27,555
<i>Hi, you've
reached the Marino residence.</i>

777
01:05:27,555 --> 01:05:29,024
<i>Thank you for your kind
messages.</i>

778
01:05:29,024 --> 01:05:31,359
<i>All our thoughts are
with Jessica and Dave,</i>

779
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:33,728
<i>and we pray they are safe
and will return soon.</i>

780
01:05:33,728 --> 01:05:36,464
Hi, Mommy.

781
01:05:36,464 --> 01:05:39,067
It's me, um,
it's... it's Jessica.

782
01:05:39,067 --> 01:05:44,439
Uh, hi, I'm okay, um...

783
01:05:44,439 --> 01:05:46,875
If you can... if you can trace
this phone call

784
01:05:46,875 --> 01:05:50,011
then maybe you can find us,
we don't know who has us.

785
01:05:50,011 --> 01:05:52,547
But I'm okay,
I'm okay, sort of.

786
01:05:52,547 --> 01:05:53,815
Please.

787
01:05:53,815 --> 01:05:55,617
Fuck, fuck!

788
01:05:56,919 --> 01:05:59,054
Come on, Christy.

789
01:05:59,054 --> 01:06:00,989
Give me something.

790
01:06:03,058 --> 01:06:05,727
Oh my God,
come on, Christy.

791
01:06:05,727 --> 01:06:08,930
Please answer,
please answer.

792
01:06:08,930 --> 01:06:10,332
<i>Jessica?</i>

793
01:06:10,332 --> 01:06:11,833
Oh my God.

794
01:06:11,833 --> 01:06:14,336
<i>Jessica is that...
- Christy, can you hear me?</i>

795
01:06:14,336 --> 01:06:16,438
<i>Oh my God, Jessica,
hello, are you there?</i>

796
01:06:16,438 --> 01:06:19,474
Hi, yeah, it's me,
can you hear me?

797
01:06:19,474 --> 01:06:22,410
<i>Jess, hello,
I can barely hear you, hello?</i>

798
01:06:22,410 --> 01:06:25,013
Christy, don't hang up,
please don't hang up.

799
01:06:25,013 --> 01:06:25,853
Hi, hi.

800
01:06:28,352 --> 01:06:30,018
Can you hear me now?

801
01:06:31,519 --> 01:06:34,522
Hello, please--
fuck, I need help.

802
01:06:34,522 --> 01:06:35,362
Please.

803
01:06:37,027 --> 01:06:38,927
I just had my sister
on the phone.

804
01:06:38,927 --> 01:06:40,128
What are you doing?

805
01:06:40,128 --> 01:06:41,997
Call 911!

806
01:06:41,997 --> 01:06:45,433
Oh my God, oh my God.

807
01:06:45,433 --> 01:06:48,169
Fuck, they shut
off my phone.

808
01:06:58,446 --> 01:07:01,149
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

809
01:08:53,596 --> 01:08:54,863
Oh my God.

810
01:08:58,701 --> 01:08:59,968
Jesus.

811
01:09:02,004 --> 01:09:03,271
Okay.

812
01:09:53,656 --> 01:09:54,956
Oh, my God.

813
01:09:56,725 --> 01:09:59,194
Oh my...
please don't be Dave.

814
01:10:08,671 --> 01:10:12,207
Oh my God, oh.

815
01:10:12,207 --> 01:10:15,743
Oh, Summer,
I'm so sorry.

816
01:10:15,743 --> 01:10:16,823
Oh, oh...

817
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:22,717
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

818
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:39,234
Maria, Maria, come on.

819
01:10:39,234 --> 01:10:43,304
Come on, look at me,
wake up.

820
01:10:43,304 --> 01:10:45,240
Come on,
we're breaking out, get up.

821
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:48,943
Maria, we're breaking
out, get up.

822
01:10:48,943 --> 01:10:50,812
Come on, get up.

823
01:10:52,281 --> 01:10:53,748
Come on.

824
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:18,866
Oh my God!

825
01:13:15,424 --> 01:13:19,160
It's been weeks...

826
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:21,129
and still
no Jessica.

827
01:13:23,165 --> 01:13:26,768
I've completely lost
track of time.

828
01:13:26,768 --> 01:13:30,037
And I'm going fucking crazy.

829
01:13:30,037 --> 01:13:33,341
And I thought that they
abandoned us here to die,

830
01:13:33,341 --> 01:13:35,510
and then they shove more

831
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:38,479
goddamned protein bars
under the door.

832
01:13:40,783 --> 01:13:42,183
There's Justin.

833
01:13:43,852 --> 01:13:45,286
He's been here...

834
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:49,190
... a while.

835
01:13:49,190 --> 01:13:51,426
He just got back
from surgery.

836
01:13:51,426 --> 01:13:54,929
And he hasn't seen
Summer in forever either.

837
01:13:56,398 --> 01:13:57,865
Okay, Justin, go ahead.

838
01:14:00,202 --> 01:14:02,236
Take a look.

839
01:14:02,236 --> 01:14:04,138
Man...

840
01:14:04,138 --> 01:14:07,508
This greenish puss,
is it... gangrene?

841
01:14:09,044 --> 01:14:11,279
I feel something
inside of me, moving.

842
01:14:15,317 --> 01:14:17,318
We need to
get out of here.

843
01:14:17,318 --> 01:14:18,586
Have you noticed that
they've been shorthanded

844
01:14:18,586 --> 01:14:20,488
the last couple weeks?

845
01:14:20,488 --> 01:14:24,258
It's the only reason you
and I are in here together.

846
01:14:24,258 --> 01:14:26,594
They wait until
we fall asleep.

847
01:14:26,594 --> 01:14:28,095
They send the short,
limping one

848
01:14:28,095 --> 01:14:30,064
in here to
collect our bandages.

849
01:14:30,064 --> 01:14:33,000
He's very weak.

850
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,402
He's deteriorating.

851
01:14:34,402 --> 01:14:36,304
He stinks.

852
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:41,108
We take two cloths,
we're going to wet them,

853
01:14:41,108 --> 01:14:42,310
lay down as if we are
going to sleep,

854
01:14:42,310 --> 01:14:44,011
and when they
come in here to gas us,

855
01:14:44,011 --> 01:14:46,614
I want you to take that cloth
and put it over your mouth.

856
01:14:46,614 --> 01:14:49,083
What makes you
think that that will work?

857
01:14:49,083 --> 01:14:50,918
They are human.

858
01:14:50,918 --> 01:14:52,386
We can kill them.

859
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:57,625
Oh, gross.

860
01:14:57,625 --> 01:14:59,126
The only reason
they come in here

861
01:14:59,126 --> 01:15:01,996
is to keep it sanitary.

862
01:15:01,996 --> 01:15:05,233
We get him when he comes
over here to pick these up.

863
01:15:07,936 --> 01:15:10,638
I'll keep my foot
on your arm,

864
01:15:10,638 --> 01:15:12,373
I'll tap you when
he walks through the door

865
01:15:12,373 --> 01:15:14,876
to make sure you're
still awake.

866
01:15:14,876 --> 01:15:16,644
Just like that.

867
01:16:01,256 --> 01:16:03,691
Justin, get the light!

868
01:16:03,691 --> 01:16:05,593
Get the light, Justin!

869
01:16:47,736 --> 01:16:49,437
He's human.

870
01:16:51,974 --> 01:16:53,474
He's got some
fucking disease.

871
01:16:57,980 --> 01:16:59,347
Let's go.

872
01:17:09,157 --> 01:17:10,758
Let's go find
Jessica and Summer.

873
01:17:39,087 --> 01:17:40,521
No, no, no!

874
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:44,792
Fuck!

875
01:17:44,792 --> 01:17:47,094
They must've put this in since
the last time we escaped.

876
01:17:48,797 --> 01:17:50,598
He probably has keys.

877
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:54,468
I'm gonna run back
and I'm gonna see

878
01:17:54,468 --> 01:17:56,337
if he has
any keys on him, okay?

879
01:17:56,337 --> 01:17:58,305
I want you to stay here
and keep a lookout.

880
01:17:58,305 --> 01:18:00,508
If you see anyone, I want
you to scream to me, okay?

881
01:18:00,508 --> 01:18:02,209
Don't... don't... don't
leave me alone here, Dave.

882
01:18:02,209 --> 01:18:03,778
Justin, stay right here

883
01:18:03,778 --> 01:18:05,680
and yell as loud as you
can if you see anyone.

884
01:18:23,632 --> 01:18:24,899
My buck knife.

885
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:30,237
I got them!

886
01:18:35,143 --> 01:18:36,610
Dave?

887
01:18:38,113 --> 01:18:39,313
Are you okay?

888
01:18:39,313 --> 01:18:40,581
The lights are out!

889
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:43,918
I can't see anything.

890
01:18:52,827 --> 01:18:54,595
Dave!

891
01:18:54,595 --> 01:18:56,397
Somebody's coming!

892
01:18:56,397 --> 01:18:57,732
Come back!

893
01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:05,206
I'm hit.

894
01:19:05,206 --> 01:19:06,456
Dave!

895
01:19:09,244 --> 01:19:11,345
I've been hit!

896
01:19:11,345 --> 01:19:12,680
I'm coming, I'm coming.

897
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:15,182
No, I'm not
letting you in.

898
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:21,822
No, I'm not letting
you in here.

899
01:19:29,197 --> 01:19:30,631
I'm here, Justin,
hang in there, hold on.

900
01:19:38,907 --> 01:19:39,657
No!

901
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:36,931
Justin, you okay?

902
01:20:53,715 --> 01:20:54,915
Fuck!

903
01:21:14,903 --> 01:21:16,370
Jessica?

904
01:21:21,476 --> 01:21:23,310
Jessica?

905
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:26,013
Fuck!

906
01:21:28,016 --> 01:21:28,976
Jessica?

907
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:31,986
Jessica?

908
01:21:34,656 --> 01:21:36,657
Is Jessica in here?
Dude, you're still alive?

909
01:21:38,026 --> 01:21:40,661
We need to go, Elliot.
They experimented on Maria.

910
01:21:40,661 --> 01:21:42,830
They implanted a chip
in the back of her neck.

911
01:21:42,830 --> 01:21:44,265
She came back, puked
for hours

912
01:21:44,265 --> 01:21:46,333
right in front
of me, and died.

913
01:21:46,333 --> 01:21:47,668
I'm sorry.

914
01:21:47,668 --> 01:21:49,837
But right now we need
to get out of here.

915
01:21:53,775 --> 01:21:55,709
This is your last chance,
Elliot!

916
01:21:55,709 --> 01:21:58,345
They tried to turn her
into a human-alien hybrid,

917
01:21:58,345 --> 01:21:59,980
that's what
the abductors are.

918
01:22:16,965 --> 01:22:18,432
Jessica?

919
01:22:20,402 --> 01:22:21,602
You check this door.

920
01:23:20,062 --> 01:23:21,595
What the fuck?

921
01:25:40,201 --> 01:25:41,668
Buzz?

922
01:25:44,572 --> 01:25:46,006
What's happened to you?

923
01:26:07,929 --> 01:26:11,265
Elliot, come on,
wake up.

924
01:26:11,265 --> 01:26:12,833
Come on.

925
01:26:27,783 --> 01:26:29,049
Jessica?

926
01:26:36,156 --> 01:26:37,691
Tiffany, wake up.

927
01:26:37,691 --> 01:26:39,226
Wake up.

928
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:47,968
Tiffany, Tiffany.

929
01:26:56,078 --> 01:26:57,945
Jessica?

930
01:26:57,945 --> 01:26:59,213
Jessica?

931
01:27:20,935 --> 01:27:22,236
Jessica.

932
01:27:23,605 --> 01:27:24,838
Wake up.

933
01:27:24,838 --> 01:27:27,274
Jess, Jess, wake up.

934
01:27:27,274 --> 01:27:29,743
Jessica, Jessica.

935
01:27:29,743 --> 01:27:31,178
Come on, come on.

936
01:27:31,178 --> 01:27:33,947
Wake up, wake up,
you okay?

937
01:27:33,947 --> 01:27:36,984
We have to
get out of here, okay?

938
01:27:36,984 --> 01:27:38,252
Up right now.

939
01:27:40,021 --> 01:27:43,090
We gotta go,
we gotta go.

940
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:00,807
You can put me down.

941
01:28:00,807 --> 01:28:03,243
You all right, are
you okay? I'm okay.

942
01:28:03,243 --> 01:28:04,678
Can you run?

943
01:28:04,678 --> 01:28:05,946
All right.

944
01:28:24,732 --> 01:28:26,066
We never left L.A.

945
01:28:26,066 --> 01:28:28,001
Oh my God.

946
01:28:30,003 --> 01:28:31,438
We're free!

947
01:28:32,774 --> 01:28:34,207
Oh, I can't believe it!

948
01:28:42,818 --> 01:28:44,384
What happened?

949
01:28:49,290 --> 01:28:50,824
I don't know.

950
01:28:50,824 --> 01:28:52,259
How long
has this been?

951
01:28:52,259 --> 01:28:55,362
I don't know,
it's less than a month.

952
01:28:55,362 --> 01:28:58,198
It looks like it's three
months, it's huge.

953
01:29:00,201 --> 01:29:01,835
It's one of them.

954
01:29:08,976 --> 01:29:10,777
Go to the fire escape,
right over here, go.

955
01:29:25,093 --> 01:29:26,360
They've got guns!

956
01:29:28,363 --> 01:29:30,397
Dave, Dave!

957
01:29:31,799 --> 01:29:33,066
Oh my God.

958
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:42,876
Hold me!

959
01:29:47,482 --> 01:29:50,183
I love you.

960
01:29:50,183 --> 01:29:51,418
Okay?
Okay.

961
01:29:51,418 --> 01:29:52,819
I love you.

962
01:29:52,819 --> 01:29:54,821
I love you.

963
01:29:54,821 --> 01:29:56,523
I love you.

964
01:29:57,305 --> 01:30:03,328
