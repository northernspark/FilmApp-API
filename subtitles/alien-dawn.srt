00:01:30,974 --> 00:01:33,408
It's November 28th, it's about

3
00:01:34,545 --> 00:01:36,172
6 o'clock in the morning.

4
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,839
Uh, my name is
Marissa Jean McCallum...

5
00:01:41,485 --> 00:01:43,851
- What the hell was that?
- I was on my way to work,

6
00:01:44,788 --> 00:01:48,189
I was driving and then all of a sudden
some things just started happening!

7
00:01:48,559 --> 00:01:52,518
Meteors contained
alien intelligence...

8
00:01:53,931 --> 00:01:55,990
Their shiny and moving and...

9
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,726
don't why we would be attacked!

10
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:04,007
The safety for the people
around the world is at stake.

11
00:02:05,842 --> 00:02:07,366
If anyone finds this...

12
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:13,741
please give it to my parents
Ellen and David McCallum...

13
00:02:13,917 --> 00:02:15,214
they live in Colorado.

14
00:02:17,754 --> 00:02:19,278
Mom Dad I love you...

15
00:02:21,925 --> 00:02:24,951
I have to go... I have to go.

16
00:02:25,262 --> 00:02:28,356
Theres no way as to...
it appears to be the key military

17
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,760
and government facilities
are the target of the attacks!

18
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:43,407
I would like to speak clearly
and candidly to the American people,

19
00:02:43,647 --> 00:02:46,445
the situation is increasingly perilous.

20
00:02:48,352 --> 00:02:51,116
Come on... we gotta go!

21
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:05,167
Come on... Come on!

22
00:03:06,003 --> 00:03:07,061
We gotta move!

23
00:03:10,007 --> 00:03:13,602
- Hurry! Come on! Go! Run!
- We saw the troops

24
00:03:14,044 --> 00:03:15,909
handing out heavy weapons.

25
00:03:17,481 --> 00:03:20,678
Come this way... come on!

26
00:03:22,886 --> 00:03:23,875
Move!

27
00:03:24,721 --> 00:03:25,585
Go!

28
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,756
The military bases have been
completely emptied.

29
00:03:34,831 --> 00:03:38,062
Their now taking all the weapons
including rocket launchers...

30
00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:42,132
and they say now that the pepople
and the military are together.

31
00:03:45,676 --> 00:03:47,041
Holy shit...

32
00:03:48,278 --> 00:03:49,370
Get down! Get down...

33
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:51,807
What are you talking about?

34
00:03:51,948 --> 00:03:53,882
- How do you know the city routes...
- What the fuck are you talking about?

35
00:03:54,117 --> 00:03:57,052
- Do you see those god damn explosions?
- The city routes are blocked!

36
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,787
We'll go to the desert, I've got guns!

37
00:03:58,955 --> 00:04:00,445
If we leave they will block the routes...

38
00:04:00,624 --> 00:04:02,387
- if we leave the city.
- It doesn't matter, if we stay here...

39
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:04,117
we're fucking sitting ducks,
we're suicides.

40
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:07,819
What is that noise?

41
00:04:08,398 --> 00:04:10,366
Come on! Come on lets go!

42
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,471
Shut up! Shut up!

43
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,840
I can't! Stop it! Don't say that to me!

44
00:04:42,432 --> 00:04:43,694
I got it! I got it!

45
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,801
- Do you know what your doing?
- Stay out of it!

46
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,393
- Your doing it wrong!
- Shut up!

47
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,507
I got it... I got it.

48
00:04:52,342 --> 00:04:56,301
- What the fuck are you doing?
- The radios on! The radios on...

49
00:04:56,513 --> 00:04:58,413
Get the god damn car started!

50
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,151
Hurry up!
Fucking muslims are attacking us!

51
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,514
Don't say that stuff,
we don't know any of that!

52
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,087
If you can't do it! I will!
Get the hell out of the way!

53
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,089
I'm trying! Give me a fucking second!

54
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:11,725
- Your talking about weapons...
- Yes! 3O miles South

55
00:05:11,862 --> 00:05:13,921
- out of this town!
- Thats in the desert!

56
00:05:14,197 --> 00:05:16,757
- That's the safest place!
- Start the fucking car!

57
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:19,594
- It's the safest place!
- Will you stop yelling in my ear?!

58
00:05:19,836 --> 00:05:22,202
Just use the blue wire
I used the yellow wire

59
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,770
- with the blue wire...
- Okay then try the other yellow wire!

60
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:25,838
I know its the blue
and the yellow I know it is.

61
00:05:27,277 --> 00:05:28,209
Hey!

62
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,741
- We have to evacuate the area now!
- We're trying!

63
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:38,653
Wait here!

64
00:06:05,549 --> 00:06:06,675
Go now!

65
00:06:07,484 --> 00:06:10,544
We've gotta get out of here right now!

66
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,781
What the hell is that?!

67
00:06:22,265 --> 00:06:23,755
It ain't fucking terrorists!

68
00:06:33,877 --> 00:06:35,105
Shit...

69
00:06:47,357 --> 00:06:48,324
Go!

70
00:06:49,793 --> 00:06:51,556
Come on... come on.

71
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:07,407
We gotta get to Paradise city

72
00:07:07,644 --> 00:07:09,441
- it's a military stronghold.
- I don't know.

73
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:10,704
It's our best bet!

74
00:07:11,081 --> 00:07:12,844
We gotta move! Come on!

75
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,370
Hey... come on!

76
00:07:37,841 --> 00:07:39,900
We're gonna get through this
but we gotta stick together.

77
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,376
I got something for them...

78
00:07:44,915 --> 00:07:46,348
they won't be expecting it.

79
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:50,751
Come on... I'm with you...
come on muah!

80
00:07:58,628 --> 00:08:00,721
This is it! I can see it! Come on!

81
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,766
Come on, just keep going!
We're almost there!

82
00:08:20,283 --> 00:08:23,218
Okay, hang on! Inside!

83
00:08:31,828 --> 00:08:32,692
We lost the others...

84
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:34,491
It's okay we don't need them.

85
00:08:39,803 --> 00:08:41,771
It's a little quieter outside but...

86
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:47,098
still there is something
in the distance.

87
00:08:48,144 --> 00:08:52,740
But Jonie...
she needs some bandages...

88
00:08:54,084 --> 00:08:57,019
I think I can help
but I'll have to go outside...

89
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,287
and

90
00:09:01,758 --> 00:09:03,191
I don't really want to go alone...

91
00:09:07,564 --> 00:09:09,691
I hate to say it but I think I need help.

92
00:09:14,838 --> 00:09:15,998
I can do this...

93
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,700
I have to do this.

94
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,295
Oh my god...

95
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,196
- What is that?
- It's an animal.

96
00:09:55,245 --> 00:09:56,371
Is it a dog?

97
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,448
It may be too late.

98
00:10:17,801 --> 00:10:18,665
Hey!

99
00:10:19,502 --> 00:10:21,367
You guys shouldn't be out here
right now, it's not safe.

100
00:10:21,838 --> 00:10:23,271
Yeah, we know.

101
00:10:23,606 --> 00:10:24,630
We're looking for some food.

102
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,772
- Do you know where we can find any?
- Do you?

103
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,246
I mean... we're unarmed
we're just tired and hungry.

104
00:10:34,584 --> 00:10:35,642
What do you mean, we?

105
00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:37,616
There is a couple of us.

106
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,625
Okay, come on. Hurry.

107
00:10:51,801 --> 00:10:52,665
Thank you.

108
00:10:54,504 --> 00:10:55,562
You okay?

109
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:56,872
No...

110
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,971
- That's a nasty gash...
- Um, this is Jonie. I'm Marissa.

111
00:11:01,878 --> 00:11:02,810
Roger.

112
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,348
- I'm Anders.
- Nice to meet you.

113
00:11:07,684 --> 00:11:10,653
Listen, I need to get medical supplies
for her head. I have some training but

114
00:11:11,154 --> 00:11:12,678
I don't have anything here to treat her.

115
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,747
- Where is the food?
- That is all that's left.

116
00:11:15,825 --> 00:11:18,794
- Is she family? A friend?
- No we just met.

117
00:11:18,862 --> 00:11:21,296
I'm a Reporter at the wrong place
at the wrong time.

118
00:11:21,464 --> 00:11:22,556
Yeah, yeah.

119
00:11:23,032 --> 00:11:25,364
So there is a store
a few blocks from here

120
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,126
but I didn't want to leave her alone and

121
00:11:28,037 --> 00:11:29,527
I thought maybe
you could stay with her?

122
00:11:29,672 --> 00:11:31,139
Yeah, I'll stay with her. Anders.

123
00:11:31,641 --> 00:11:32,608
Absolutely.

124
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:34,375
You gonna be okay.

125
00:11:34,744 --> 00:11:37,645
Your head and we'll be back soon.

126
00:11:38,081 --> 00:11:39,844
- It's bad... be careful.
- Okay.

127
00:11:40,683 --> 00:11:42,082
- I'll take care of you.
- Thank you.

128
00:11:43,553 --> 00:11:45,851
- You hungry?
- No, no, no.

129
00:11:45,922 --> 00:11:46,980
You sure?

130
00:11:48,358 --> 00:11:49,791
You know what
I could use is some water.

131
00:11:50,727 --> 00:11:51,591
Okay.

132
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:55,090
- We're not going far, it's just up here.
- You sure?

133
00:11:55,765 --> 00:11:57,130
Yeah, I used to work around here.

134
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,002
So much for the military

135
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:15,443
they just swatted us like
insects or something.

136
00:12:17,187 --> 00:12:18,711
We're smarter than insects.

137
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:21,381
I hope so.

138
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,452
All citizens are urged to arm
themselves anyway they can.

139
00:12:24,761 --> 00:12:27,229
Vice President Clinton says
we should resist at every turn.

140
00:12:38,107 --> 00:12:40,632
Any other family? Other than Roger?

141
00:12:41,544 --> 00:12:44,775
No no, Roger's it half brother
he's sorta family.

142
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:46,679
More than my Ex-Wife.

143
00:12:47,784 --> 00:12:50,446
What about you? Sister?

144
00:12:51,321 --> 00:12:52,515
You don't have kids do you?

145
00:12:52,822 --> 00:12:54,517
- No... god no.
- Husband?

146
00:12:55,325 --> 00:13:00,092
Parents and a horse. Don't judge me.

147
00:13:01,231 --> 00:13:03,222
- What's his name?
- Baby.

148
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,267
Can't tell me not to judge you...
listen to that name.

149
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,273
- Do you know these people?
- No.

150
00:13:21,117 --> 00:13:22,345
Hey, hows it going man?

151
00:13:25,188 --> 00:13:28,282
- Is this your store?
- It's a military run facility.

152
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,582
Whats your regiman?
What do you mean?

153
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:32,592
Does this AK-47 say something
about military to you?

154
00:13:32,762 --> 00:13:34,627
- Calm down man calm down!
- There are just two of us.

155
00:13:34,964 --> 00:13:36,522
Your not welcome here! Get out!

156
00:13:36,866 --> 00:13:39,733
The nest store is too far
we just need a moment and...

157
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:41,765
I've been doing this all fucking day!

158
00:13:42,005 --> 00:13:43,870
People like you
keep coming to me huh?

159
00:13:44,641 --> 00:13:46,836
It's a big store,
there is enough food for all of us.

160
00:13:47,443 --> 00:13:48,910
Then you can find
a fucking Taco Bell.

161
00:13:49,145 --> 00:13:50,703
Your not helping anyone
but yourselves...

162
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,212
- I don't need to talk to you get out!
- Your not moving yet!

163
00:13:53,483 --> 00:13:56,145
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Alright! Alright!

164
00:13:57,553 --> 00:13:59,578
- Thanks a lot.
- What the fuck?

165
00:14:00,356 --> 00:14:01,254
What were you thinking...

166
00:14:01,524 --> 00:14:02,650
what are you doing
shooting guns at them?

167
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,626
- Look I've been doing this all fucking day.
- We need bullets!

168
00:14:06,462 --> 00:14:08,430
My head is pounding...

169
00:14:08,998 --> 00:14:10,966
can you get the lights,
it's just throbbing.

170
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,962
Yeah, absolutely. Hang on a second.

171
00:14:14,304 --> 00:14:18,035
Your proud of that? Fuck you?

172
00:14:22,245 --> 00:14:23,371
Fuck you!

173
00:14:24,314 --> 00:14:25,474
Get out of here!

174
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,049
Wake up...

175
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,720
- Fuck!
- Need a blanket?

176
00:14:34,023 --> 00:14:35,991
- I could use some water.
- Sure.

177
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:37,851
There is some over there.

178
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:39,493
Here you go.

179
00:14:40,063 --> 00:14:41,758
- Here, I'll help you up.
- Yeah, thanks.

180
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:46,126
Okay, here you go.

181
00:14:52,742 --> 00:14:53,766
What's wrong?

182
00:14:59,882 --> 00:15:01,679
Let me turn the lights on,
hang on a second.

183
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,847
I don't know what to do...
What's wrong?

184
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:11,350
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong with her?

185
00:15:11,761 --> 00:15:13,695
She just started gagging,
I don't know what's wrong with her!

186
00:15:14,197 --> 00:15:16,597
I just gave her some water!
And then she started gagging!

187
00:15:16,766 --> 00:15:17,698
What's wrong?

188
00:15:17,867 --> 00:15:21,997
- Jonie Can you breathe for me?
- Water? This is bleach!

189
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:25,436
I didn't know!
I thought I was giving her water!

190
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:29,243
Roger! Roger! Roger!

191
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,877
Give me the milk!
The milk from the bag right now!

192
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,650
Okay Jonie,
I need you to try not and get sick.

193
00:15:35,885 --> 00:15:38,479
I need you to drink this
and try to keep it down.

194
00:15:38,821 --> 00:15:41,051
- Come on, come on Jonie...
- Roger give them some space.

195
00:15:41,224 --> 00:15:42,521
I'm holding her!

196
00:15:43,126 --> 00:15:47,290
Jonie, stay on your left side
and keep it down.

197
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,756
- It's going to make you better.
- What should I do?

198
00:15:49,665 --> 00:15:51,292
She's a Nurse!
She knows whats going on!

199
00:15:52,235 --> 00:15:54,135
I'm trying to help her!

200
00:15:54,404 --> 00:15:56,395

202
00:15:59,442 --> 00:16:00,568

00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,574
I don't know, lets keep her calm.

205
00:16:04,747 --> 00:16:08,410
Jonie, look at me it's gonna be fine.
I'm going to give you some more milk.

206
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:12,187
Try to breathe. You can't get sick Jonie.
Lay down Jonie.

207
00:16:12,422 --> 00:16:14,322
Just lay down, just lay down.

208
00:16:15,758 --> 00:16:17,692
- What did you give her?
- I don't know.

209
00:16:18,694 --> 00:16:20,628
I've never done this before,
I don't know.

210
00:16:20,863 --> 00:16:21,955
Wheres the Army?

211
00:16:22,465 --> 00:16:25,093
Just give her some space.
I am giving her space.

212
00:16:25,268 --> 00:16:27,600
Fucking calm down!

213
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:35,004
- Stupid! This is your fault!
- Stop calling me fucking stupid asshole!

214
00:16:35,478 --> 00:16:36,376
Come on!

215
00:16:36,646 --> 00:16:38,807
- Lets talk about it right here!
- Stop fighting!

216
00:16:40,983 --> 00:16:42,245
Oh my god! Theres blood...

217
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,079
Jonie? Just lay down!

218
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:47,185
I need the towel give me the towel.

219
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,122
Oh my god, she's still bleeding...

220
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,692
Will you just talk to her?
Talk to her and keep her calm.

221
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:58,690
Jonie, you are safe,
you need to try to stay calm.

222
00:16:58,901 --> 00:17:01,062
Take deep breaths Jonie,
Take deep breaths.

223
00:17:01,838 --> 00:17:02,998
What do we do?

224
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,708
- Just give her some space.
- She's dying!

225
00:17:07,243 --> 00:17:10,610
- Stop it! Help me! Can you help me?
- You have one enough!

226
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,676
So...

227
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:18,010
Jonie is dying.

228
00:17:18,721 --> 00:17:21,690
I wish we could get her
to a hospital or...

229
00:17:24,227 --> 00:17:26,627
anywhere we could pump her
stomach and give her medicine.

230
00:17:28,264 --> 00:17:30,289
I might be able to help her, but here,

231
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,734
there is nothing I can do.

232
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,760
When I was a little girl,

233
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,567
I had a horse named Pumpkin.

234
00:17:41,677 --> 00:17:44,373
And he fell and broke his leg.

235
00:17:46,782 --> 00:17:49,546
And they said he probably
didn't have a chance.

236
00:17:51,554 --> 00:17:52,578
Probably.

237
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,721
Its the probably
that kills you though, you know?

238
00:18:02,365 --> 00:18:03,730
I didn't want to do it.

239
00:18:06,802 --> 00:18:08,394
I didn't know want to do it now.

240
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,007
Ah, I can't think about this.

241
00:18:19,382 --> 00:18:21,282
They can probably do it
better than I could.

242
00:18:25,121 --> 00:18:26,782
I hate to say it, but I need them.

243
00:18:29,158 --> 00:18:30,523
There is something else I can do.

244
00:18:31,561 --> 00:18:33,756
There has to be something else
we can do.

245
00:18:33,996 --> 00:18:35,429
Listen there is nothing else
we can do.

246
00:18:35,831 --> 00:18:37,628
- Please...
- She's going to die.

247
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,391
So what are we supposed to do then?

248
00:18:40,403 --> 00:18:41,665
It's going to get more
and more people,

249
00:18:41,837 --> 00:18:45,568
I think I think we have to end it.

250
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:47,435
To kill her?

251
00:18:52,982 --> 00:18:56,679
Okay. How do we kill her?

252
00:18:58,788 --> 00:19:01,518
- I don't know.
- I won't shoot her.

253
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,252
- Okay.
- I won't do it.

254
00:19:06,796 --> 00:19:07,728
Maybe...

255
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,395
what if we snapped her neck?

256
00:19:13,803 --> 00:19:16,738
It would be quick, right?
You don't feel that pain, right?

257
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,973
Tell me she won't feel that pain.

258
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:21,367
Okay.

259
00:19:22,545 --> 00:19:25,742
Alright. I'll do this. I will do this.

260
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,439
I will do this it's okay.

261
00:19:29,685 --> 00:19:32,119
I don't know how I can't do this.

262
00:19:33,189 --> 00:19:34,451
Just figure it out.

263
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:38,054
- I'm sorry...
- Get away from me!

264
00:19:38,194 --> 00:19:39,821
Stop Jonie stop!

265
00:19:41,063 --> 00:19:42,826
Jonie you need to
let him do this, okay?

266
00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:46,059
There is nothing else we can do.
It's just going to get worse.

267
00:19:48,004 --> 00:19:51,462
Get away! Get away! Get away!

268
00:19:54,243 --> 00:19:56,575
I can't do this! I need you...

269
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:07,312
Hey Jonie, look up here Jonie?

270
00:20:09,425 --> 00:20:10,392
It's alright.

271
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:13,695
Can you see me? Look at me...

272
00:20:14,764 --> 00:20:15,890
No...

273
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,997
Okay. Close your eyes.

274
00:20:21,203 --> 00:20:22,192
Relax.

275
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,534
Close your eyes.

276
00:20:48,064 --> 00:20:49,531
We are trying to keep all water,

277
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,293
electricity and
communication services active.

278
00:20:52,702 --> 00:20:56,570
Please go to our government
and news outlets for more information.

279
00:21:08,751 --> 00:21:09,683
How you doing?

280
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,652
I can't get clean.

281
00:21:13,923 --> 00:21:14,787
Yeah, I know.

282
00:21:18,994 --> 00:21:21,690
- Do you wanna talk about it?
- No! No!

283
00:21:27,069 --> 00:21:29,333
Well other people might need
to talk about it you know,

284
00:21:30,439 --> 00:21:31,531
we're only human.

285
00:21:31,774 --> 00:21:32,900
Yeah, go talk.

286
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:37,240
But you don't need anything
your just fine, your cool?

287
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,451
No its cool,
just shut yourself out you know.

288
00:21:46,122 --> 00:21:47,783
But what are we supposed to do? Huh?

289
00:21:49,592 --> 00:21:51,685
- What are we supposed to do?
- I don't know!

290
00:21:51,961 --> 00:21:54,293
- We can't stay here anymore.
- We can't...

291
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,923
- There is nothing here!
- We gotta do something!

292
00:21:57,767 --> 00:21:59,564
What? What do you want to do?

293
00:22:02,838 --> 00:22:03,930
We need to leave,

294
00:22:05,941 --> 00:22:07,101
we need to go now.

295
00:22:07,877 --> 00:22:09,572
We need to do something, but...

296
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,809
Hey man don't do that.

297
00:22:13,149 --> 00:22:15,208
- Don't do what? Console her?
- Thats enough.

298
00:22:15,484 --> 00:22:17,611
After she see just watched someone
get their neck snapped?

299
00:22:18,654 --> 00:22:19,780
It was your fault.

300
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:22,254
It was no ones fault.

301
00:22:23,793 --> 00:22:25,658
Fuck you! My fault?

302
00:22:27,363 --> 00:22:28,523
You would have done the same thing.

303
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:31,164
How the hell was I supposed know
it was pitch black in here?

304
00:22:33,202 --> 00:22:34,931
- Your stupid man.
- Why don't you start worrying about

305
00:22:35,037 --> 00:22:36,664
what the fuck we need to do? Huh?

306
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:39,637
- Why don't you think about that shit!
- Hey! Stop it! Both of you!

307
00:22:41,477 --> 00:22:44,105
It's not making anything better.
Do you understand?

308
00:22:44,346 --> 00:22:45,472
We need to get out of here.

309
00:22:46,482 --> 00:22:49,645
Your not thinking straight.
And that's all good but you need to listen.

310
00:22:49,885 --> 00:22:51,648
- We're gonna listen to your plan?
- Yeah...

311
00:22:51,921 --> 00:22:53,081
Is that what we're supposed to do?

312
00:22:53,222 --> 00:22:54,712
And your plan is what?

313
00:22:55,925 --> 00:22:57,449
To go in attack mode?

314
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,019
- Three against a hundred?
- Yeah... no!

315
00:23:00,229 --> 00:23:02,754
- With our one machine gun?
- Some kind of action!

316
00:23:03,999 --> 00:23:06,729
Better than being couped up!

317
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,566
What? Not to going some place
with more weapons and people?

318
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,466
So we can fight back as a group?

319
00:23:12,241 --> 00:23:14,709
- No! Your the Lone Ranger I forgot!
- Stop fighting!

320
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:19,242
Please! Both of you!

321
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,843
- Don't fucking touch her!
- Stop!

322
00:23:24,286 --> 00:23:26,186
What the fuck are you to her? Huh?

323
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:30,687
- Oh God this isn't the answer.
- I will touch her

324
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,019
- if I want to fucking touch her.
- Oh come on Brother...

325
00:23:34,363 --> 00:23:35,830
- What Brother?
- You know better than that?

326
00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:40,163
Do I? And what are you gonna do?

327
00:23:43,405 --> 00:23:45,771
- That's what I thought.
- I got a plan man...

328
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:47,502
- okay.
- Lets hear the plan.

329
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:50,907
- Your stupid you could do it anyway.
- I'm stupid? I'm stupid?

330
00:23:51,247 --> 00:23:54,216
Well I'm the stupid ass that's
going to take her with me and protect her.

331
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,409
Go on and take a shot at me,
if that's what you want.

332
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,845
- Take a shot at me.
- You would like that wouldn't you?

333
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,178
You want to be a super hero?

334
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,648
Go be a fucking super hero
on your own.

335
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:17,198
The Department of Defense

336
00:24:17,406 --> 00:24:19,840
has issued protocon instructions
for the building of explosives.

337
00:24:20,442 --> 00:24:22,171
Check with your news outlets,
internet sites,

338
00:24:22,344 --> 00:24:25,040
local libraries and schools
for important information.

339
00:24:25,748 --> 00:24:28,546
Take care and follow
the instructions very carefully.

340
00:24:28,951 --> 00:24:30,748
Our continued survivval

341
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,287
on how effective we are
on fighting the terrorists invaders.

342
00:24:53,842 --> 00:24:55,036
You here Paulo?

343
00:24:59,281 --> 00:25:01,749
Oh, oh my fucking god.

344
00:25:07,356 --> 00:25:09,916
These machines have been systemarcily
picking up people,

345
00:25:10,225 --> 00:25:11,954
for what reasons we can't.

346
00:25:24,673 --> 00:25:26,607
Washington DC has taken a huge hit.

347
00:25:27,643 --> 00:25:29,201
The White House has been leveled.

348
00:25:31,647 --> 00:25:33,444
Hold on... Go again go again

349
00:25:35,517 --> 00:25:36,415
Oh my god!

350
00:25:37,353 --> 00:25:40,288
The President of the United States
is dead.

351
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,202
Hey Man! Buddy!

352
00:26:41,116 --> 00:26:45,018
Come on! Faster! Buddy! Faster, faster!
Walk man come on, come on!

353
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,320
We find a car,

354
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,021
we just drive

355
00:26:54,763 --> 00:26:56,526
and we don't stop
untiI we hit Paradise City.

356
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:57,891
What if no ones there?

357
00:27:00,602 --> 00:27:03,537
We figure something else out.

358
00:27:04,273 --> 00:27:06,298
Drive some place else
to no matter where we have to go...

359
00:27:06,508 --> 00:27:07,566
we need to move...

360
00:27:08,277 --> 00:27:09,835
- no more sitting ducks.
- Okay.

361
00:27:12,781 --> 00:27:13,645
Anders?

362
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,414
What?

363
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:18,547
We're gonna leave at dawn.

364
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:20,653
Okay.

365
00:27:21,957 --> 00:27:24,653
- And I want you to come with us.
- No... no.

366
00:27:28,764 --> 00:27:30,698
One word answers. He sits alone

367
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,331
in his mind in a dark room
and deals with things.

368
00:27:42,444 --> 00:27:43,775
They are gonna waste us
if we stay here!

369
00:27:44,046 --> 00:27:48,142
What? We are gonna get wasted
if we stay here! We have to go!

370
00:27:54,123 --> 00:27:55,886
- Tell me when.
- Okay hold on.

371
00:27:58,627 --> 00:27:59,559
Okay.

372
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:01,691
Come on guys... come on.

373
00:28:10,405 --> 00:28:11,372
Go man...

374
00:28:13,842 --> 00:28:14,706
It's not working.

375
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,974
It's gonna blow man! Ditch it!

376
00:28:20,516 --> 00:28:23,679
It's gonna blow man,
dude its gonna blow!

377
00:28:49,845 --> 00:28:52,643
We have no plan. We are stuck in here.

378
00:28:53,715 --> 00:28:56,013
We barely have any food...
we're running out of water...

379
00:28:57,753 --> 00:28:59,721
I mean... things are not getting
any better outside...

380
00:28:59,922 --> 00:29:01,787
what if they never get better?
What are we supposed to do?

381
00:29:01,957 --> 00:29:03,686
We can't just stay here
we have have to go.

382
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,251
We have to go.

383
00:29:05,894 --> 00:29:08,294
But they can never agree upon
when or why or how.

384
00:29:08,463 --> 00:29:09,327
And he's building these bombs

385
00:29:09,464 --> 00:29:11,364
and we don't know if any
of these bombs are going to work.

386
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,765
I don't think he knows what he's doing.

387
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:18,732
I don't know what I'm doing.

388
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,104
I don't like it here.

389
00:29:24,112 --> 00:29:25,204
I feel...

390
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,845
restless. I feel caught.

391
00:29:29,985 --> 00:29:32,249
I'm shocked...
but I didn't get enough stuff.

392
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,319
Yeah, well there is nothing
up there either.

393
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:37,523
Yeah?

394
00:29:39,161 --> 00:29:43,029
Not that I could tell
I don't know its really dark.

395
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,158
Aw, come on.

396
00:29:45,734 --> 00:29:47,531
No... oh great!

397
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:49,136
Marissa? Where are you?

398
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:51,804
Marissa?

399
00:29:55,844 --> 00:29:56,970

400
00:29:58,847 --> 00:29:59,745

Are you alright?

403
00:30:10,025 --> 00:30:11,049
Am I alright?

404
00:30:13,362 --> 00:30:15,694
No... no, I'm not alright.

405
00:30:15,764 --> 00:30:17,493
- Hey... hey, hey.
- People are dying!

406
00:30:17,766 --> 00:30:20,132
And we're stuck here
and we can't leave

407
00:30:20,469 --> 00:30:22,596
and we don't even know
what we're doing! I just want to go!

408
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:25,930
- I just wanna run away and hide!

409
00:30:26,441 --> 00:30:28,909
- I just wanna go...
- I know. I know.

410
00:30:30,512 --> 00:30:31,774
I just wanna go.

411
00:30:32,814 --> 00:30:33,746
Look at me.

412
00:30:34,983 --> 00:30:37,474
Okay? I'm here...

413
00:30:39,187 --> 00:30:41,314

414
00:30:43,825 --> 00:30:48,091
bad stuff and channel it,
redirect us, yeah channel it...

415
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:50,425
we're gonna take it into
what we're doing, Okay?

416
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,661
Look at me it's me...

417
00:30:56,471 --> 00:30:58,962
- I'm not going anywhere alright?
- Okay.

418
00:31:00,742 --> 00:31:02,369
- I'm not going anywhere...
- Okay?

419
00:31:07,683 --> 00:31:08,650
I promise.

420
00:31:09,351 --> 00:31:11,046
Hey, the power is out.

421
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:13,921
That's no good.

422
00:31:14,923 --> 00:31:15,719
Yeah.

423
00:31:29,004 --> 00:31:30,938
What the hell are they doing
out there?

424
00:31:31,073 --> 00:31:33,098
- I have no idea.
- Why won't they leave?

425
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,401
Just go away just leave?

426
00:31:36,745 --> 00:31:38,303
There are like 2O out there?

427
00:31:39,414 --> 00:31:40,608
What are you doing?

428
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,445
- Close the door!
- You asked me what they are doing?

429
00:31:44,386 --> 00:31:45,284
Come on!

430
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,152
Oh my fucking god!

431
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,327
God dammit motherfucker.

432
00:32:20,922 --> 00:32:23,447
Hey! Stop playing with that thing,
it's not a toy.

433
00:32:23,825 --> 00:32:25,258
I'm not playing... I'm practicing.

434
00:32:26,294 --> 00:32:27,318
Practicing.

435
00:32:29,064 --> 00:32:30,031
What are you doing?

436
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:31,691
Homemade bombs.

437
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:37,672
How do you know
how to make a homemade bomb?

438
00:32:39,641 --> 00:32:40,801
What's in a homemade bomb?

439
00:32:41,076 --> 00:32:45,240
I know lots of things little bit of this
little bit of that and some of this.

440
00:32:46,948 --> 00:32:47,937
Nice.

441
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:51,610
What do we do with the bombs
after they are done?

442
00:32:54,122 --> 00:32:55,521
Just looking for a detonator.

443
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,266
Here we go.

444
00:33:14,843 --> 00:33:15,605
Get out of there...

445
00:33:15,944 --> 00:33:17,809
get out of there
come on, come on, come on.

446
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,640
- Give me the gun.
- I got the shot.

447
00:33:36,865 --> 00:33:38,162
Good shot! Good shot!

448
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,171
Run... run!

449
00:34:02,924 --> 00:34:03,686
Gun looks okay.

450
00:34:04,826 --> 00:34:06,418
Yeah, you dropped the gun
what are you doing?

451
00:34:06,661 --> 00:34:08,959
Yeah, I was trying not to get hit
by a fucking branch.

452
00:34:09,264 --> 00:34:11,129
- Is it okay or not?
- Thanks for your concern.

453
00:34:12,734 --> 00:34:15,794
Guys... really love our new skylight.

454
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,434
I think it is officially time
for us to leave.

455
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,168
Yeah, she's right.

456
00:34:23,345 --> 00:34:25,779
Yeah, but first
we should survey the area.

457
00:34:26,781 --> 00:34:27,645
Up here... come on.

458
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:29,211
Your going on the roof?

459
00:34:33,922 --> 00:34:35,685
Up here we're gonna
get ourselves killed.

460
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:54,308
What do you see?

461
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:56,769
I don't know...

462
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:58,574
Iooks like they are building
something.

463
00:35:00,882 --> 00:35:02,247
They're not building anything.

464
00:35:06,388 --> 00:35:07,650
What the fuck is that?

465
00:35:13,828 --> 00:35:15,090
I can see the truck.

466
00:35:16,398 --> 00:35:18,127
About 5 more minutes,
I know I can start it this time.

467
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,565
- We shouldn't be out in the open.
- Dude, it's the only way out of here.

468
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:23,000
We can't be seen up here
on this roof this entire time.

469
00:35:31,313 --> 00:35:33,213
Alright is this everything?

470
00:35:33,682 --> 00:35:37,550
- Yeah, I think so.
- I got the gun and the food.

471
00:35:38,086 --> 00:35:38,950
And the food.

472
00:35:39,788 --> 00:35:42,655
Grab the its not water.

473
00:35:43,124 --> 00:35:44,591
So we don't suffer from anything.

474
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:48,294
What else do we need?
Any extra food in the back?

475
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:49,427
Hear that?

476
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:51,497
- What?
- What?

477
00:35:52,601 --> 00:35:53,533
That!

478
00:35:54,803 --> 00:35:55,735
What is that?

479
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:02,035
Oh my god.

480
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:07,078
Hey, look up there.

481
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:11,844
I don't think that's good.

482
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:15,787
That is some nasty shit.

483
00:36:17,826 --> 00:36:21,694
- Look at those people.
- We need to get inside. Get inside!

484
00:36:21,963 --> 00:36:22,725
Go!

485
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,929
Grab everything... lets go!

486
00:36:31,406 --> 00:36:36,434
- Get the lights... find it faster.
- I can't fucking find it any faster!

487
00:36:36,645 --> 00:36:37,907
I need the extra towels from the store.

488
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,741
Unwrap that stuff, we don't need
any of that shit getting in here.

489
00:36:40,982 --> 00:36:43,212
- Here! Here!
- Thank you.

490
00:36:44,185 --> 00:36:45,152
Your a little bit out of control.

491
00:36:45,353 --> 00:36:46,980
I think there is little bit
of that in my lungs now.

492
00:36:48,923 --> 00:36:50,982
Hear that? Great! Your paranoid.

493
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:55,928
No.

494
00:36:56,398 --> 00:36:59,595
No. We should have fucking left
two hours ago. I knew it!

495
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:01,598
- Well, we didn't.
- Why don't you ever fucking listen to me?

496
00:37:01,836 --> 00:37:02,860
You want to get into that?

497
00:37:03,071 --> 00:37:08,407
We are sitting in a fucking bathroom
with no place to go!

498
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:11,235
Why would I listen to you anyway
with all your stupid ideas?

499
00:37:11,846 --> 00:37:14,747
Stupid? Your stupid idea
was to fucking stay here!

500
00:37:14,883 --> 00:37:16,248
Now look at us
we're in a fucking bathroom!

501
00:37:16,584 --> 00:37:18,609
If we had left,
we would be dead already!

502
00:37:18,753 --> 00:37:22,245
We would be in this state
if we had left two hours ago!

503
00:37:23,024 --> 00:37:23,991
Fuck!

504
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,227
Do you guys ever get along?

505
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:32,565
It's not gonna matter anyway.

506
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:35,970
Why don't you turn off the fucking lights
to save our fucking batteries?

507
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:38,930
Yeah, right. Why don't you say fuck
a couple of more times?

508
00:37:39,207 --> 00:37:41,641
- I don't do well in small spaces.
- You should calm down...

509
00:37:42,477 --> 00:37:44,638
plenty of food and water
and everyone's fine.

510
00:37:45,146 --> 00:37:47,740
Plenty of food and water?
All we have is 3 bottles of fucking water

511
00:37:48,316 --> 00:37:49,647
and a couple bags of chips.

512
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:51,674
Yeah, we're gonna be fucking great.

513
00:37:51,986 --> 00:37:54,386
The Department of Defense instructs
for everyone to stay indoors.

514
00:37:54,723 --> 00:37:56,520
Tape up your doors and window sills.

515
00:37:56,825 --> 00:37:59,055
If you have a gas mask...
we urge you to use it.

516
00:37:59,327 --> 00:38:02,694
If you don't have one use a towel
to cover up your mouth and nose.

517
00:38:02,831 --> 00:38:05,527
The black smoke has only has
a life for a few hours.

518
00:38:22,751 --> 00:38:26,482
No. We're going to do Countries,
starting with the letter A.

519
00:38:26,821 --> 00:38:27,788
Roger.

520
00:38:30,759 --> 00:38:31,885
Afghanistan.

521
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:34,889
- Right? A country.
- That works.

522
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:35,961
Libya

523
00:38:36,865 --> 00:38:37,627
Cuba

524
00:38:38,433 --> 00:38:39,297
Denmark

525
00:38:41,803 --> 00:38:45,603
Um. England. Yeah, I need help.

526
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:48,171
France... Jesus it's hot.

527
00:38:49,878 --> 00:38:50,640
Germany

528
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:57,215
- Haiti
- Yoy know what?

529
00:38:59,454 --> 00:39:00,978
What is that sound right now?

530
00:39:02,123 --> 00:39:02,987
Hey!

531
00:39:03,391 --> 00:39:05,382
Are you kidding?
Are you fucking eating?

532
00:39:06,194 --> 00:39:07,286
Hey! Hey! Hey!

533
00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:11,890
What are you doing?
We got the same supply here.

534
00:39:12,066 --> 00:39:13,556
This isn't part of our supply.
This is my food from earlier.

535
00:39:14,702 --> 00:39:16,966
There wasn't any food from earlier
when we came in here.

536
00:39:19,841 --> 00:39:21,900
It's to be equal share
for everybody, Roger!

537
00:39:22,243 --> 00:39:25,041
- This isn't part of our share.
- This is my food from earlier!

538
00:39:25,313 --> 00:39:26,803
The bag was already open!

539
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:29,849
But we agreed we have so little and
whatever we have is cut evenly.

540
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,719
I don't believe
that's what we did at all.

541
00:39:32,987 --> 00:39:37,651
I said these bags right here
are what we all split.

542
00:39:37,926 --> 00:39:39,518
This, is what I found in my
own pocket.

543
00:39:40,562 --> 00:39:43,030
This is why you're not in a relationship,
because your fucking selfish.

544
00:39:43,598 --> 00:39:45,361
Right here...
learn something about yourself.

545
00:39:47,902 --> 00:39:49,995
Yeah, did I hit a little too
close to home?

546
00:39:51,406 --> 00:39:53,772
You hide food in here
and don't tell us about it,

547
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:56,573
we're supposed to eat at the same time
and divide it evenly.

548
00:39:56,878 --> 00:39:59,210
- Hold on a second.
- What? If I had a breath mint,

549
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:01,612
would you want me to break
that into three too?

550
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:03,041
Yes I do!

551
00:40:04,552 --> 00:40:05,814
That is the stupidest fucking thing...

552
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:07,978
How about the water?
Did you drink the water too?

553
00:40:08,223 --> 00:40:11,659
No! Did I drink the water too?
No! It wasn't in my pocket from earlier!

554
00:40:11,793 --> 00:40:14,091
Why don't you just bathe in it?
I don't give a shit!

555
00:40:15,864 --> 00:40:16,956
Something stinks in here!

556
00:40:17,198 --> 00:40:18,893
- Dude, you got your shoes off!
- It's probably you.

557
00:40:21,069 --> 00:40:22,934
Wow! You guys are unbelievable.

558
00:40:23,872 --> 00:40:26,807
You know what? I'm gonna go see
how things are outside

559
00:40:27,108 --> 00:40:29,372
since things in here
can't get any worse.

560
00:40:29,744 --> 00:40:31,644
I don't think you should go outside.

561
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,849
Well... I would rather be out there
than in here.

562
00:40:34,983 --> 00:40:37,144
So, do you think while I'm gone,

563
00:40:38,152 --> 00:40:41,519
while I'm gone, can you guys
resolve whatever this is,

564
00:40:41,723 --> 00:40:44,283
so from now on
we can move on and stop fighting.

565
00:40:44,792 --> 00:40:46,089
Because this is not getting us anywhere.

566
00:40:47,428 --> 00:40:49,487
And frankly, I'm tired of listening to it.

567
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:50,694
Grow up!

568
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:53,327
You shouldn't go. It hasn't been
two hours yet. How long has it been?

569
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,602
Do we have any idea
how long its been?

570
00:41:32,707 --> 00:41:33,696
I gotta pee.

571
00:41:34,876 --> 00:41:37,174
- Well, can't you hold it?
- No.

572
00:41:39,881 --> 00:41:41,815
Give me a second
untiI I find some place.

573
00:41:48,222 --> 00:41:49,189
Hurry.

574
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:55,751
I need help!

575
00:41:57,799 --> 00:41:58,697
What?

576
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,126
Toilet paper?

577
00:42:02,804 --> 00:42:04,135
Sorry kid, I'm fresh out.

578
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:05,863
Well find something.

579
00:42:08,142 --> 00:42:09,837
Ah, Jesus...

580
00:42:19,153 --> 00:42:20,051
No.

581
00:42:20,421 --> 00:42:21,979
- It's a receipt!
- Exactly!

582
00:42:28,763 --> 00:42:31,630
- No!
- Hey! At least it's not used.

583
00:42:33,267 --> 00:42:34,256
Whatever.

584
00:42:36,237 --> 00:42:37,932
Beggars can't be choosers kid.

585
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,365
- Want it back?
- No! It's all yours!

586
00:43:10,071 --> 00:43:12,471
Well... I guess it now or never, right?

587
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:14,902
I wonder if their gonna nuke the City?

588
00:43:16,644 --> 00:43:18,407
They will not nuke the City. Trust me.

589
00:43:24,919 --> 00:43:27,080
Holy shit! I fucking knew it!

590
00:43:27,321 --> 00:43:30,654
Look, I told you! Didn't I?
I called it! I knew it!

591
00:43:30,758 --> 00:43:31,986
You can have all the credit Roger!

592
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,525
What if they do this to all the Cities?

593
00:43:33,761 --> 00:43:35,695
No, No, no... one or two Cities
would be a good deterrent,

594
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:36,693
if they do anymore than that

595
00:43:36,798 --> 00:43:38,356
then we'll have to start from
the beginning and be like cavemen.

596
00:43:38,566 --> 00:43:39,498
Well, maybe we'll have to

597
00:43:39,634 --> 00:43:41,534
and that is the only way
we can get ride of these things.

598
00:43:42,103 --> 00:43:44,867
Holy shit! Look at that! Look at That!

599
00:43:45,273 --> 00:43:46,934
2 million people still living over there,

600
00:43:47,075 --> 00:43:48,702
oh great their gone,
now we can write them off.

601
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,443
Where the hell is the Military?

602
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,670
I mean, shouldn't they be here,
shouldn't they be fighting?

603
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,473
Is there anyone doing anything,

604
00:43:55,683 --> 00:43:57,014
We've barely seen
any Military presence,

605
00:43:57,151 --> 00:43:59,346
they probably hit them first,
that was their strategy.

606
00:44:00,421 --> 00:44:03,447
So it was like their plan.

607
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:06,852
It had to be their plan.

608
00:44:07,161 --> 00:44:08,753
Look if we get to Paradise City,

609
00:44:08,996 --> 00:44:11,487
it's a Military town, we can get guns,

610
00:44:11,799 --> 00:44:14,199
ammunition, we can start
doing something right now!

611
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:16,597
- Whatever is left of the town.
- You think there is anyone left?

612
00:44:17,805 --> 00:44:21,707
Paradise City and Little Haven
are both cleared as radiation free zones.

613
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,877
On this side of Paradise City has been
bombarded with dozens more sunders.

614
00:44:29,383 --> 00:44:32,250
The invaders have constructed
a base camp that is suspected.

615
00:44:49,003 --> 00:44:51,995
I think it's the alternator, I can't...

616
00:44:52,507 --> 00:44:53,599
Hey...

617
00:44:54,842 --> 00:44:56,833
- Hey!
- Hey! Hey!

618
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,584
I still can't believe
that my home is gone.

619
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,718
You never think that something like
is going to happen to you.

620
00:45:18,166 --> 00:45:22,933
But at least the planes are back.

621
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:31,772
Maybe they are going to
where the Military is.

622
00:45:33,047 --> 00:45:35,481
Hopefully, that place
is where we're going too.

623
00:45:52,233 --> 00:45:53,131
What are you thinking?

624
00:45:55,603 --> 00:45:56,729
They are all going the same way.

625
00:45:59,874 --> 00:46:02,502
I tell you what... there are going
to people banding together,

626
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,037
we'll see who's left. Alright?

627
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:08,838
If I had a guess, I would say
it's probably what 2OO, OOO of them

628
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:14,485
and there are 2 billion people

629
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:18,918
assuming, so that is 2O, OOO
to every one invader.

630
00:46:20,161 --> 00:46:21,219
Those are our odds.

631
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,762
- That is pretty good.
- Thanks!

632
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,727
That's assuming that there are
that many people left.

633
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,651
Hey... you finally
got this piece of crap running.

634
00:46:49,757 --> 00:46:52,055
Couple tried to get it...
good to see you.

635
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,626
- Yeah, happy to see you too.
- Wait you guys know each other?

636
00:46:54,962 --> 00:46:56,759
- We met earlier.
- Do you have any food?

637
00:46:57,765 --> 00:46:58,891
We've got some chips in the car.

638
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,326
I'll get you some alright?

639
00:47:00,801 --> 00:47:02,166
Good to see your still walking around.

640
00:47:02,837 --> 00:47:04,065
You know it.

641
00:47:05,706 --> 00:47:07,139
Paradise City?

642
00:47:07,708 --> 00:47:10,040
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Got room for two?

643
00:47:10,478 --> 00:47:12,105
- Yeah we do. Lets go.
- Alright,

644
00:47:16,717 --> 00:47:17,843
Hang on, gotta grab my gun!

645
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:25,891
Yeah, first thing we're gonna do
is get a hot meal

646
00:47:26,827 --> 00:47:29,625
and some fresh and a shower.

647
00:47:34,402 --> 00:47:35,460
What the hell is that?

648
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,259
I don't know.

649
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,333
No don't touch it.

650
00:47:41,642 --> 00:47:42,700
It's got thorns...

651
00:47:45,246 --> 00:47:47,237
I've never seen anything
like this around here.

652
00:47:48,182 --> 00:47:51,811
Hey! Come check this out!

653
00:47:52,586 --> 00:47:54,520
Maybe its from one of those
tripod things.

654
00:47:54,722 --> 00:47:57,987
That's black smoke coming down,
maybe it was seeding or something.

655
00:48:07,034 --> 00:48:08,399
I saw this movie once

656
00:48:09,003 --> 00:48:12,370
where the human race
had to escape Earth

657
00:48:13,274 --> 00:48:16,766
and they ended up on another Planet
and in order to survive on that Planet

658
00:48:16,911 --> 00:48:21,678
they had to adapt to their environment.
So they started to planting things,

659
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:23,842
so they could live there.

660
00:48:24,518 --> 00:48:26,645
I think that's
what they are doing here.

661
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:30,487
- It's called terraforming.
- Yes,

662
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,189
terraformer.

663
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:35,092
To make it inhabitable,
changing the biological systems.

664
00:48:35,363 --> 00:48:36,227
Yeah.

665
00:48:36,797 --> 00:48:38,287
We need to know what's down there.

666
00:48:38,799 --> 00:48:39,993
Someone to scout it out?

667
00:48:41,202 --> 00:48:43,670
I'll do it. Go down there,

668
00:48:44,805 --> 00:48:46,397
listen, watch, observe them,

669
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:49,700
figure out what their doing,
what their weaknesses are.

670
00:48:50,144 --> 00:48:51,202
Maybe get some supplies.

671
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,575
- You can't go down there by yourself.
- I can get down there. I'll go down there.

672
00:48:53,714 --> 00:48:57,650
- No one of us... No, I'll go.
- We should all go.

673
00:48:58,319 --> 00:48:59,650
Why just by yourself?

674
00:48:59,787 --> 00:49:01,084
Because I'm faster

675
00:49:01,389 --> 00:49:03,687
and I can take care of myself
and worrying about to other people

676
00:49:04,625 --> 00:49:05,592
is just gonna slow it down.

677
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,694
And there is more of a chance
for us to get caught.

678
00:49:10,798 --> 00:49:13,392
You stay here, you take care of her.

679
00:49:13,834 --> 00:49:16,166
I'll be back. I guarantee it.

680
00:49:22,243 --> 00:49:23,608
Well, I don't like it either way man.

681
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:25,846
It will be good.

682
00:49:27,681 --> 00:49:28,613
I will.

683
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:30,748
Be safe.

684
00:50:02,383 --> 00:50:03,350
How you doing?

685
00:50:04,718 --> 00:50:06,276
Hm, good.

686
00:50:07,955 --> 00:50:11,857
- Cold. Tired.
- Yeah right. Cold I know, I know.

687
00:50:13,561 --> 00:50:14,493
I'm cold.

688
00:50:18,566 --> 00:50:19,726
You know your funny.

689
00:50:20,034 --> 00:50:21,001
Huh?

690
00:50:24,038 --> 00:50:25,665
I think if this hadn't happened,

691
00:50:27,875 --> 00:50:29,035
you know you and me,

692
00:50:30,878 --> 00:50:32,505
wouldn't have happened either?
Right?

693
00:50:33,714 --> 00:50:34,840
In the real world?

694
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:42,282
The normal world at the bar,
when things were.

695
00:50:46,594 --> 00:50:51,224
I don't know, maybe you're different.

696
00:50:55,703 --> 00:50:56,863
Your different too,

697
00:50:58,839 --> 00:50:59,931
crazy...

698
00:51:01,742 --> 00:51:02,970
not different.

699
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:08,648
You may be right,
this would not have happened.

700
00:51:10,751 --> 00:51:12,150
Now everything is different,

701
00:51:14,588 --> 00:51:15,577
everything is changing.

702
00:52:21,155 --> 00:52:22,588
Hey you okay?

703
00:52:23,958 --> 00:52:26,188
Water... water, I need water.

704
00:52:28,429 --> 00:52:32,627
What happened?

705
00:52:35,035 --> 00:52:36,730
The invaders have all these people

706
00:52:37,271 --> 00:52:38,761
in this fenced area and their just

707
00:52:39,006 --> 00:52:41,497
- sucking all their blood out!
- How many are down there?

708
00:52:41,675 --> 00:52:43,700
Thousands!
Thousands and thousands!

709
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:46,212
Any Military?
Any aggressive presence?

710
00:52:46,347 --> 00:52:48,872
- Any good sign at all?
- There is no hope! We lost!

711
00:52:49,283 --> 00:52:51,342
We're done! It's over! Goodbye!

712
00:52:51,518 --> 00:52:52,815
There is nobody else!

713
00:52:54,722 --> 00:52:55,780
This war is over!

714
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:09,534
Guys come here.

715
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:11,335
Come in here.

716
00:53:15,242 --> 00:53:16,709
I've got something in mind,

717
00:53:18,679 --> 00:53:19,771
there is a move we can make.

718
00:53:21,682 --> 00:53:23,206
I hope its better than your last plan.

719
00:53:23,717 --> 00:53:25,014
We have a plan,

720
00:53:26,754 --> 00:53:27,880
and bombs.

721
00:53:29,189 --> 00:53:32,852
And anders has been teaching me
how to make bombs.

722
00:53:33,761 --> 00:53:36,696
That's very strange.
It's actually very interesting

723
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:42,201
and we have a little arsenal going,
which is cool.

724
00:53:44,905 --> 00:53:48,397
I guess you could say
that I am a terrorists.

725
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,639
Maybe that is not such
a bad thing always?

726
00:53:54,515 --> 00:53:55,812
I kind a like it.

727
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:03,722
I am waiting for the tripod,

728
00:54:04,558 --> 00:54:06,924
the others are setting up
the bombs at the car.

729
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:14,127
And I volunteered to be the bait.

730
00:54:16,804 --> 00:54:18,601
I ran a little track in high school,

731
00:54:20,908 --> 00:54:23,775
hopefully, I can still run

732
00:54:24,712 --> 00:54:27,738
fast enough to get away
from this thing.

733
00:54:30,317 --> 00:54:31,807
And hopefully, our bombs work.

734
00:54:33,587 --> 00:54:37,523
Anders made them, I don't know
how he knows so much about bombs.

735
00:54:38,158 --> 00:54:40,058
He said it was from
the Military information

736
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:42,162
they sent out when the whole thing
started, but...

737
00:54:43,797 --> 00:54:46,163
it's almost like he knew before that.

738
00:54:48,268 --> 00:54:49,929
I don't know who this guy is,

739
00:54:52,005 --> 00:54:55,771
but if he saves us all, I guess...

740
00:54:58,746 --> 00:54:59,610
who cares?

741
00:55:02,483 --> 00:55:05,941
Anyway, I don't know why
we are doing this.

742
00:55:06,353 --> 00:55:08,048
The Military, we keep asking.

743
00:55:08,922 --> 00:55:09,854
I keep asking...

744
00:55:17,831 --> 00:55:18,923
It's coming.

745
00:55:32,279 --> 00:55:33,610
It's too close.

746
00:55:36,984 --> 00:55:38,349
God, I can't do this.

747
00:55:41,221 --> 00:55:43,849
This is never gonna work,
it's too close. This is crazy.

748
00:55:44,024 --> 00:55:47,118
I was there, I was gonna do it.
I don't know, I was just...

749
00:55:48,162 --> 00:55:51,495
I'm Never gonna get away
from that thing. It's too fast.

750
00:55:51,832 --> 00:55:53,561
I'm not that good of a runner.

751
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:55,359
We don't even know
if those things are gonna go off.

752
00:55:55,669 --> 00:55:56,601
We need a better plan.

753
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:06,439
I can do this,

754
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:10,481
I know I can do this.

755
00:56:15,222 --> 00:56:16,189
It's time.

756
00:56:20,494 --> 00:56:21,722
Here goes nothing.

757
00:57:09,643 --> 00:57:11,907
You've got to apply some pressure
to the middle switch,

758
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:13,637
that is the trigger.

759
00:57:14,214 --> 00:57:15,476
This is not gonna work.

760
00:57:17,484 --> 00:57:18,746
It's gonna work.

761
00:57:18,919 --> 00:57:22,719
- Anything it's not gonna work!
- That was one grenade.

762
00:57:22,923 --> 00:57:25,050
You gotta have faith.

763
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:29,689
Yes, that is the trigger.
Right, pump it up.

764
00:57:32,833 --> 00:57:34,357
It better fucking work!

765
00:57:34,801 --> 00:57:36,735
Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my god!

766
00:57:37,237 --> 00:57:38,363
Come on guys!

767
00:57:39,072 --> 00:57:40,972
These sons of bitches!

768
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:43,702
I told you!
I knew it was going to work!

769
00:58:21,381 --> 00:58:22,814
Good job!

770
00:58:24,318 --> 00:58:26,218
Yeah baby! Yeah!

771
00:58:28,155 --> 00:58:29,588
Fuck you, yeah!

772
00:58:31,158 --> 00:58:32,318
We got you!

773
00:58:33,026 --> 00:58:34,891
- We got you!
- Guys, hold on a second.

774
00:58:35,162 --> 00:58:36,527
There is something in the distance!
Guys! Guys!

775
00:58:36,863 --> 00:58:37,693
We gotta get out of here!

776
00:58:38,999 --> 00:58:40,125
Run baby run!

777
00:58:54,481 --> 00:58:55,470
Run!

778
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:00,484
Wait! Wait...

779
00:59:04,358 --> 00:59:06,087
They could die!

780
00:59:10,063 --> 00:59:11,360
We need to help them!

781
00:59:59,046 --> 01:00:01,446
So we have guards everywhere

782
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:03,740
and a fence that goes
all the way around,

783
01:00:04,317 --> 01:00:07,081
this looks like it's not going
to be real easy.

784
01:00:08,321 --> 01:00:10,186
There are ways through the fence.

785
01:00:10,757 --> 01:00:11,689
Big enough for a person?

786
01:00:11,925 --> 01:00:13,449
Yeah, big enough for sure.
I'll show you.

787
01:00:13,727 --> 01:00:14,557
Are they safe?

788
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:19,931
The guards too
I don't see it being a problem.

789
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,267
There are flyers
that are going above the line.

790
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:27,830
It's looks like they are
on a random system, but they are not.

791
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,975
Look, see the first one going by?

792
01:00:31,078 --> 01:00:32,170
- Right there?
- Yeah.

793
01:00:32,479 --> 01:00:34,572
It's going to our advantage right now.

794
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:36,944
The second one that goes by,
start counting after that,

795
01:00:37,350 --> 01:00:38,612
there is a break in between.

796
01:00:40,487 --> 01:00:42,717
We can time it so there is not
any activity, we can get through there.

797
01:00:43,757 --> 01:00:44,849
It's almost time to go.

798
01:00:48,428 --> 01:00:50,328
I just don't want to forget something.

799
01:00:50,964 --> 01:00:51,896
Um...

800
01:00:54,801 --> 01:00:56,735
this is going to sound crazy, but.

801
01:00:59,239 --> 01:01:01,639
When I was standing
to face face with that thing.

802
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:03,436
It looked at me.

803
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:10,239
And it's like I heard a voice,

804
01:01:10,484 --> 01:01:13,851
like not a voice. More like a feeling.

805
01:01:16,823 --> 01:01:18,188
And it looked at me

806
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,422
like a person would look at a cow
or something.

807
01:01:24,364 --> 01:01:25,695
Just as food, but...

808
01:01:26,967 --> 01:01:29,959
not angry more I like thought, more

809
01:01:32,672 --> 01:01:36,233
like regret almost

810
01:01:37,677 --> 01:01:38,644
and shame.

811
01:01:42,482 --> 01:01:43,813
It's not what I expected.

812
01:01:46,386 --> 01:01:48,047
It's lonely without the others

813
01:01:49,923 --> 01:01:51,288
and I'm really scared for them.

814
01:01:53,827 --> 01:01:58,287
The United States Government is urging
every citizen to protect themselves.

815
01:01:58,865 --> 01:02:02,232
Every man, woman and child is
now responsible for their own safety.

816
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:05,362
If you have a firearm,
you need to use it.

817
01:02:05,872 --> 01:02:07,772
- Our Military has...
- We almost set?

818
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:10,109
Yeah.

819
01:02:10,877 --> 01:02:11,809
What do we have left on that one?

820
01:02:14,514 --> 01:02:16,880
Looks good, but not much
for this other one.

821
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:20,347
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

822
01:02:22,422 --> 01:02:23,650
Never enough is it?

823
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:28,692
And these things,
are they actually gonna work?

824
01:02:32,365 --> 01:02:33,229
They better.

825
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:02,087
Jesus, it dark out here
without the lights.

826
01:03:03,063 --> 01:03:04,087
What is that?

827
01:03:04,464 --> 01:03:06,329
Looks like an oiI refinery.

828
01:03:07,801 --> 01:03:09,359
It's not pretty,

829
01:03:11,504 --> 01:03:13,768
- I don't like it.
- Is there gonna be anything left?

830
01:03:15,642 --> 01:03:16,700
We have to think positive.

831
01:03:20,347 --> 01:03:23,612
Under the circumstances,
we'll have to see won't we?

832
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:24,747
I guess so.

833
01:03:29,789 --> 01:03:30,778
You got this?

834
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:36,688
I used to like driving at night.

835
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:39,323
When you were younger?

836
01:03:42,202 --> 01:03:43,726
- Yeah.
- Me too.

837
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:55,540
Anders should be back any second.

838
01:03:55,982 --> 01:03:58,610
He said this would only take 2O minutes
but he's been gone a lot longer.

839
01:03:58,785 --> 01:04:00,650
- I'm hopes he didn't...
- What the hell are you doing here?

840
01:04:00,754 --> 01:04:02,654
My god... I'm waiting for a friend.

841
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:04,656
What company are you with?
This is Bravo company's territory.

842
01:04:04,791 --> 01:04:05,917
I'm not with a company!

843
01:04:06,192 --> 01:04:08,319
We heard the emergency broadcast,
we brought some bombs.

844
01:04:08,561 --> 01:04:10,324
Then we better go get them.
Because its gonna go...

845
01:04:10,563 --> 01:04:12,690
No! I have people down there!
You can't blow it yet!

846
01:04:13,366 --> 01:04:14,333
What are you doing with that?

847
01:04:15,802 --> 01:04:18,930
I'm just filming some stuff, you know,
I thought it might come in handy later.

848
01:04:19,639 --> 01:04:20,799
For my family and stuff.

849
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:22,908
You okay?

850
01:04:24,878 --> 01:04:28,006
Look, my friend Anders is down there.
He needs to know what is going on.

851
01:04:29,349 --> 01:04:30,338
Let's go.

852
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:42,419
Just wait here,
I'm gonna go check things out.

853
01:04:47,367 --> 01:04:48,732
Oh shit!

854
01:05:05,352 --> 01:05:06,751
This is a really bad idea!

855
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:08,987
I should have just waited for Anders.

856
01:05:11,758 --> 01:05:15,091
God, those things just
scoop you up and that's it.

857
01:05:17,797 --> 01:05:19,094
This isn't gonna work.

858
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:22,461
Hey! Thanks god your back!

859
01:05:35,882 --> 01:05:36,814
Come on!

860
01:06:14,921 --> 01:06:15,853
See him?

861
01:06:16,990 --> 01:06:17,888
No.

862
01:06:20,427 --> 01:06:21,655
- No Roger.
- Me either.

863
01:06:22,595 --> 01:06:24,358
Okay, lets keep going
there is more up ahead.

864
01:06:25,165 --> 01:06:26,223
Come on.

865
01:06:29,602 --> 01:06:30,933
- Roger!
- Roger!

866
01:06:32,839 --> 01:06:34,739
Don't touch the fence,
its all electric over here.

867
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:36,572
Fuck it's good to see you!

868
01:06:36,709 --> 01:06:38,700
- How you doing? How you doing man?
- I'm doing good man.

869
01:06:39,045 --> 01:06:40,603
- What's up brother?
- Are you okay? Are you hurt?

870
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:42,074
Okay sweetie,
we're gonna get you out of here.

871
01:06:42,782 --> 01:06:44,875
We don't have time for this,
we gotta blow the fence.

872
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:46,642
There is a whole bunch
of weapons right over there.

873
01:06:46,719 --> 01:06:49,483
- Right over where?
- Right over there. / We got it.

874
01:06:49,722 --> 01:06:52,885
Everyone back away from the fence,
we're gonna blow it!

875
01:06:53,393 --> 01:06:54,655
Come on!

876
01:07:04,637 --> 01:07:06,366
We gotta go! Come on!

877
01:07:15,315 --> 01:07:16,543
Okay listen... where is Sera?

878
01:07:16,749 --> 01:07:19,741
They take everybody to that
black temple right over there.

879
01:07:19,919 --> 01:07:22,285
- Right over there?
- No, honey, you have to stay.

880
01:07:24,624 --> 01:07:26,182
What is your name? I'm Rennick.

881
01:07:26,759 --> 01:07:28,283
- I'm Anders.
- It's not safe there!

882
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:35,731
- Tell her we she has to stay!
- We'll come back for you! Let's go!

883
01:07:36,669 --> 01:07:38,603
- This is Tiffany.
- You got her? I got her.

884
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:41,407
I want to come!

885
01:07:41,674 --> 01:07:44,302
I know! But you can't!
You've got to stay! This is Rennick.

886
01:07:44,644 --> 01:07:45,611
He's going to take care of you!

887
01:07:46,112 --> 01:07:48,603
All right! You got to stay with him.

888
01:08:05,231 --> 01:08:06,493
What is this place?

889
01:08:07,867 --> 01:08:08,799
I've no idea.

890
01:08:09,235 --> 01:08:12,261
- It fucking reeked in here.
- Yeah it does.

891
01:08:28,321 --> 01:08:29,788
Do we know what we're doing in here?

892
01:08:32,125 --> 01:08:33,592
What the fuck was that!?

893
01:08:34,327 --> 01:08:36,693
It's my handy work, it's mine.

894
01:08:36,796 --> 01:08:37,820
- Your handy work?
- Done.

895
01:08:38,264 --> 01:08:41,097
How did the fuck did you learn
how to make a bomb with timer?

896
01:08:43,469 --> 01:08:44,663
Reading books?

897
01:08:44,904 --> 01:08:47,771
- You? Read? Bullshit.
- Guys...

898
01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:53,408
Hey there is something up there.
Catch the light.

899
01:08:55,682 --> 01:08:57,673
Anders, seriously I know Dr. Suess

900
01:08:57,951 --> 01:08:59,885
does not teach you
how to make a bomb with a timer.

901
01:09:08,962 --> 01:09:11,726
You son of a bitch! Let go!

902
01:09:23,710 --> 01:09:24,608
Heads!

903
01:09:49,302 --> 01:09:52,169
You son of a bitch! Let go!

904
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:33,573
Jesus...

905
01:10:40,586 --> 01:10:43,851
I don't know what I was expecting,
but definitely, this is not it.

906
01:10:44,123 --> 01:10:45,988
Come on Roger, I've seen what
you brought home when your drunk.

907
01:10:49,796 --> 01:10:54,699
So I guess this is where
I'm supposed to ask you

908
01:10:55,702 --> 01:10:57,192
where your from and what you want.

909
01:11:04,644 --> 01:11:05,906
But honestly, I don't care.

910
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:11,745
Come on guys, let's kill this bitch!

911
01:11:28,401 --> 01:11:31,666
Yeah, come on, get her out of here.

912
01:11:31,838 --> 01:11:32,930
Come on! Get up!

913
01:11:33,439 --> 01:11:35,703
Get up! We gotta get out of here!

914
01:11:55,161 --> 01:11:57,152
- Does this belong to you?
- Yeah she does.

915
01:11:57,363 --> 01:11:58,728
Don't fucking leave me again!

916
01:11:59,031 --> 01:12:00,931
- Damn...
- Good job by the way.

917
01:12:01,167 --> 01:12:02,657
Hey thanks. Just getting started.

918
01:12:03,035 --> 01:12:04,559
I'm going to get
these people out of the cages.

919
01:12:04,871 --> 01:12:07,203
- Keep your heads down! ...Y ou too!
- Good luck!

920
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:49,638
- How are you doing? You making it?
- Fucking yeah.

921
01:12:50,483 --> 01:12:52,417
- You want get down?
- Put me down.

922
01:12:52,752 --> 01:12:55,585
This is by no means
an admission to inferiority.

923
01:13:01,394 --> 01:13:02,691
So where do we go from here?

924
01:13:04,597 --> 01:13:06,565
Well, we could keep running and hiding

925
01:13:07,767 --> 01:13:11,931
or we can find another nest
of those brain blobs

926
01:13:12,071 --> 01:13:14,005
and fry the living daylights
out of them.

927
01:13:21,881 --> 01:13:22,745
Shit!

928
01:13:31,791 --> 01:13:33,520
I think I used too many explosives.

929
01:13:35,995 --> 01:13:37,121
No, where.

930
01:13:40,366 --> 01:13:41,731
It's never enough.

931
01:13:51,244 --> 01:13:53,769
Come on. Let's move.

932
01:14:00,987 --> 01:14:05,481
The United States Government is urging
every Citizen to protect themselves.

933
01:14:05,958 --> 01:14:09,325
Every man, woman and child
is responsible for their safety.

934
01:14:09,829 --> 01:14:12,696
If you have a firearm,
you need to use it.

935
01:14:26,279 --> 01:14:27,371
We did it.

936
01:14:28,981 --> 01:14:30,039
We won.

937
01:14:31,918 --> 01:14:33,818
But it doesn't really feel like a victory,

938
01:14:36,422 --> 01:14:37,980
Just feels like a starting point.

939
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:42,284
Cause we still have to fight.

940
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:49,397
We have to fight untiI we kill
every one of these fucking creatures

941
01:14:49,602 --> 01:14:50,728
and take back what is ours.

942
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:54,005
Because I refuse to run,
and I refuse to be scared

943
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,208
and I refuse to hide
for the rest of my life

944
01:14:56,342 --> 01:14:57,775
waiting for something
to come around a corner!

945
01:14:57,877 --> 01:14:59,640
Well that's not
going to happen anymore!

946
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:01,612
I won't do it.

947
01:15:04,784 --> 01:15:06,217
So they can leave

948
01:15:09,388 --> 01:15:10,582
or they can die.

949
01:15:14,994 --> 01:15:16,928
Because we are the resistance.

950
01:15:18,631 --> 01:15:20,030
And that's all there is.

951
01:15:21,305 --> 01:15:27,389
GOM Player is used by millions of 
people around the world, find out why!
