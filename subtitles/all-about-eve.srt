00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:09,860
The Sarah Siddons Award
is perhaps unknown to you.

3
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,740
It has been spared the sensational publicity

4
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,100
of such questionable honours
as the Pulitzer Prize

5
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:20,860
and those awards presented annually
by that... film society.

6
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,740
The distinguished-looking gentleman
is an extremely old actor.

7
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,100
Being an actor,
he will go on speakingfor some time.

8
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,140
It is not important that you hear what he says.

9
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,340
However, it is important that you know
where you are and why you are here.

10
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,860
This is the dining hall
of the Sarah Siddons Society.

11
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:44,220
It is the annual banquet and presentation
of the highest honour our theatre has:

12
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,780
the Sarah Siddons Awardfor
Distinguished Achievement.

13
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,620
These hallowed walls,
indeed many of these faces,

14
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,700
have looked upon Modjeska,
Ada Rehan and Minnie Fiske.

15
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,900
Mansfield's voice filled this room.

16
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,660
It is unlikely that the windows
have been opened since his death.

17
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:06,380
The minor awards, as you can see,
have already been presented.

18
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,780
Minor awards are for such
as the writer and director,

19
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,460
since they merely construct a tower

20
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,300
so that the world can applaud
a light which flashes on top of it.

21
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:20,580
And no brighter light has ever
dazzled the eye than Eve Harrington.

22
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,900
Eve... but more of Eve later.

23
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,020
All about Eve, in fact.

24
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:31,660
To those who do not read, attend the theatre,
listen to unsponsored radio programmes

25
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,380
or know anything of the world
in which you live,

26
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,700
it is perhaps necessary to introduce myself.

27
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,860
My name is Addison DeWitt.

28
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:45,420
My native habitat is the theatre.
In it, I toil not. Neither do I spin.

29
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,900
I am a critic and commentator.

30
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,540
I am essential to the theatre.

31
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,620
This is Karen Richards.

32
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:57,020
She is the wife of a playwright,
therefore of the theatre by marriage.

33
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:03,260
Nothing in her background should have
brought her closer to the stage than Row E.

34
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,180
However, during her senior year at Radcliffe,
Lloyd Richards lectured on the drama.

35
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,220
The following year
Karen became Mrs Lloyd Richards.

36
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,860
There are, in general,
two types of theatrical producers.

37
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:20,260
One has a great many wealthy friends
who will risk a tax-deductible loss.

38
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,700
This type is interested in art.

39
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,980
The other is one to whom each production
means potential ruin or fortune.

40
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,060
This type is out to make a buck.

41
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,420
Meet Max Fabian.

42
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,300
He is the producer of the play which has won
for Eve Harrington the Sarah Siddons Award.

43
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,660
Margo Channing is a star of the theatre.

44
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:47,260
She made her first stage appearance at
the age of four in Midsummer Night's Dream.

45
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,780
She played a fairy and entered,
quite unexpectedly, stark naked.

46
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,260
She has been a star ever since.

47
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,220
Margo is a great star. A true star.

48
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,140
She never was or will be
anything less or anything else.

49
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:09,180
Having covered in tedious detail not only
the history of the Sarah Siddons Society,

50
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:14,540
but also the history of acting since
Thespis first stepped out of the chorus line,

51
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,740
our distinguished chairman has finally
arrived at our reason for being here.

52
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:24,900
I have been proud and privileged
to have spent my life in the theatre,

53
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:29,740
a poor player that struts
and frets his hour upon the stage,

54
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,220
and I've been honoured to be, for 40 years,

55
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,060
chief prompter of the Sarah Siddons Society.

56
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,740
39 times have I placed in deserving hands

57
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,300
this highest honour the theatre knows.

58
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,180
Surely no actor is older than I.

59
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,060
I've earned my place - out of the sun.

60
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:58,900
And never before has this award gone to
anyone younger than its recipient tonight.

61
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,980
How fitting that it should
pass from my hands to hers.

62
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,660
Such young hands. Such a young lady.

63
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:11,460
Young in years, but whose heart
is as old as the theatre.

64
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,820
Some of us are privileged to know her.

65
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,100
We have seen beyond the beauty and artistry

66
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,300
that have made her name
resound through the nation.

67
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:24,140
We know her humility, her devotion,

68
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,260
her loyalty to her art,

69
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,740
her love, her deep and abiding love for us,

70
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:35,340
for what we are and what we do - the theatre.

71
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,100
She has had one wish,

72
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,780
one prayer, one dream:

73
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,340
to belong to us.

74
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,860
Tonight her dream has come true,

75
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:50,660
and henceforth
we shall dream the same of her.

76
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,260
Ladies and gentlemen, for distinguished
achievement in the theatre,

77
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:59,220
the Sarah Siddons Award...
to Miss Eve Harrington.

78
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,660
Eve. Eve, the golden girl. The cover girl.

79
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:46,020
The girl next door, the girl on the moon.
Time has been good to Eve.

80
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:51,020
Life goes where she goes. She's been
profiled, covered, revealed, reported,

81
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,940
what she eats and what
she wears and whom she knows

82
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,060
and where she was and
when and where she's going.

83
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,900
Eve.

84
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,380
You all know all about Eve.

85
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,060
What can there be to know
that you don't know?

86
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,700
When was it? How long?

87
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,340
It seems a lifetime ago.

88
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:15,820
Lloyd always said that in the theatre a lifetime
was a season and a season a lifetime.

89
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,460
It's June now. That was early October.

90
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,420
Only last October.

91
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,060
It was a drizzly night.
I remember I asked the taxi to wait.

92
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,740
Where was she?

93
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:40,300
Strange. I'd become so accustomed
to seeing her there night after night,

94
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,420
I found myself lookingfor a girl
I'd never spoken to.

95
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,900
Wondering where she was.

96
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,220
Mrs Richards?

97
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,580
There you are.

98
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,700
It seemed odd, suddenly, your not being here.

99
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,060
- Why should you think I wouldn't be?
- Why should you be?

100
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:08,660
Six nights a week for weeks of watching even
Margo Channing enter and leave a theatre.

101
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,340
- You don't mind my speaking to you?
- Not at all.

102
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:15,020
I've seen you so often.
It took every bit of courage I could raise.

103
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,580
To speak to just a playwright's wife?

104
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,020
I'm the lowest form of celebrity.

105
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:24,260
You're Margo Channing's best friend.
You and your husband are always with her.

106
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,980
And Mr Sampson. What's he like?

107
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,340
Bill Sampson? He's a director.

108
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,580
- He's the best.
- He'll agree with you.

109
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:38,540
Tell me. What do you do in between
the time Margo goes in and comes out?

110
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,020
Just huddle in that doorway and wait?

111
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,980
No. I see the play.

112
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:48,580
You see the play? You've seen
every performance of this play?

113
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,620
Yes.

114
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,220
But don't you find it, apart from
everything else, don't you find it expensive?

115
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,300
Standing room doesn't cost much. I manage.

116
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,420
- I'm gonna take you to Margo.
- No.

117
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,020
- Yes. She's got to meet you.
- No, I'd be imposing on her.

118
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,100
I'd be just another tongue-tied fan.

119
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,260
There isn't another like you.
There couldn't be.

120
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,980
If I'd known... Some other time.
Looking like this.

121
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,500
You look just fine.
By the way, what's your name?

122
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,580
Eve. Eve Harrington.

123
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,100
- Good evening, Gus.
- Good evening, Mrs Richards.

124
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,860
- Good night.
- Good night, Gus.

125
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,700
You can breathe it, can't you?

126
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,300
Like some magic perfume.

127
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,500
Wait right here. Don't run away.

128
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,820
"If the South had won,
you could write plays about the North."

129
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,140
- Hi.
- Hello!

130
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,900
"I don't think
you can rightly say we lost the war."

131
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,460
"We was more starved out, you might say."

132
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:18,380
"I don't understand all these plays
about love-starved Southern women."

133
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,940
"Love is one thing we were
never starved for in the South."

134
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,500
Margo's interview with
a reporter from the South.

135
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,740
When it gets printed, they're
gonna fire on Gettysburg again.

136
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,700
- It was Fort Sumter they fired on.
- I never played Fort Sumter.

137
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,100
Honeychild had a point.
Lloyd, honey, be a playwright with guts.

138
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:41,380
Write me one about a nice, normal woman
who just shoots her husband.

139
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,860
- You need new girdles.
- Buy some.

140
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,740
- Same size?
- Of course.

141
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,820
I find these wisecracks
increasingly less funny.

142
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,940
- Aged in Woodhappens to be a fine play.
- That's my loyal little woman.

143
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,420
The critics thought so.
The audiences think so.

144
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,980
Packed houses, tickets
four months in advance.

145
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,540
I can't see that Lloyd's plays
have hurt you any.

146
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,500
- Easy now.
- Relax, kid, it's just me and my big mouth.

147
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:11,020
You get me so mad sometimes. Of all
the women with nothing to complain about...

148
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,180
- Ain't it the truth?
- Yes, it is.

149
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,620
You're talented, famous, wealthy.

150
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:19,740
People waiting around night after night
just to see you. Even in the rain.

151
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:25,020
Autograph fiends. They're not people. Little
beasts that run around in packs like coyotes.

152
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,860
- They're your fans.
- They're nobody's fans.

153
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,580
They're juvenile delinquents.
They're nobody's audience.

154
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,380
They never see a play or a movie.
They're never indoors long enough.

155
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,740
Well, there's one indoors right now.

156
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,140
- I've brought her back to see you.
- You've what?

157
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,980
She's just outside the door.

158
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,940
The heave-ho.

159
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,580
But you can't put her out. I promised.

160
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:54,260
Margo, you've got to see her. She worships
you. It's like something out of a book.

161
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,820
That book is out of print.
Those days are gone.

162
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,980
But if you'd only see her...
You're her whole life.

163
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,660
You must have spotted her by now.
She's always there.

164
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:07,700
The mousy one with
the trench coat and the funny hat.

165
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,740
How could I miss her?
Every night, every matinée.

166
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,100
Come in, Eve.

167
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,820
- I thought you'd forgotten about me.
- Not at all.

168
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,980
Margo, this is Eve Harrington.

169
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,460
- How do you do, my dear?
- Oh, brother.

170
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,420
- Hello, Miss Channing.
- My husband.

171
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,540
- Hello, Miss Harrington.
- How do you do?

172
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,700
And this is my dear friend
and companion, Miss Birdie Coonan.

173
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,940
- Oh, brother.
- Miss Coonan.

174
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,580
- Oh, brother, what?
- When she gets like this,

175
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,780
she starts playing Hamlet's mother.

176
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,500
I'm sure you must have things
to do in the bathroom, Birdie, dear.

177
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,940
If I haven't, I'll find
something till you get normal.

178
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,940
Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington?

179
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,100
Harrington.

180
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,780
- I'm so sorry. Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

181
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,860
- Would you like a drink?
- I was saying how often you've seen the play.

182
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,420
No, thank you.

183
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,300
Yes, I've seen every performance.

184
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:13,540
Every performance?
Then am I safe in assuming you like it?

185
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,460
- I'd like anything Miss Channing played in.
- Would you really? How sweet.

186
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,580
I doubt very much that
you'd like her in The Hairy Ape.

187
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,380
Please don't misunderstand me, Mr Richards.

188
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:29,020
I think part of Miss Channing's greatness
lies in her ability to pick the best plays.

189
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,100
- Your new play is for Miss Channing, isn't it?
- Of course it is.

190
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,700
- How did you hear about it?
- There was an item in The Times.

191
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,460
I like the title, Footsteps on the Ceiling.

192
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,500
Yes, but let's get back to this one.

193
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,660
- Have you really seen every performance?
- Yes.

194
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,700
Why? I'm curious.

195
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:52,060
Well, if I didn't come to see the play,
I wouldn't have anywhere else to go.

196
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:56,700
- There are other plays.
- Not with you in them. Not by Mr Richards.

197
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:00,060
But you must have friends, a home, family?

198
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,660
Tell us about it, Eve.

199
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,740
- If I only knew how.
- Try.

200
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,380
Well...

201
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,980
Well, it started with the play before this one.

202
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,300
- Remembrance.
- Remembrance.

203
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,260
- Did you see it here in New York?
- San Francisco.

204
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,700
It was the last week. I went one night.

205
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,740
The most important night
of my life... until now.

206
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,780
I found myself going the next night
and the next and the next.

207
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,020
Every performance.

208
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,740
Then, when the show went East, I went East.

209
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:59,620
- Eve, why don't you start at the beginning?
- It couldn't possibly interest you.

210
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,940
Please.

211
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:06,580
I guess it started back home.
Wisconsin, that is.

212
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,940
It was just Mom and Dad and me.

213
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:13,180
I was an only child.
I used to make believe a lot when I was a kid.

214
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:17,100
Acted out all sorts of things.
What they were isn't important.

215
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:22,020
But, somehow, acting and make-believe
began to fill up my life more and more.

216
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,700
It got so I couldn't tell
the real from the unreal.

217
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,980
Except that the unreal
seemed more real to me...

218
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:33,900
- I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I?
- Not at all.

219
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:39,340
Farmers were poor in those days.
That's what Dad was, a farmer.

220
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,460
I had to help out.

221
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:48,900
So I quit school, went to Milwaukee,
became a secretary... in a brewery.

222
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:54,060
When you're a secretary in a brewery, it's
hard to make believe you're anything else.

223
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,020
Everything is beer.

224
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,860
It wasn't much fun, but it helped at home.

225
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:06,020
And there was a little theatre group there,
like a drop of rain on the desert.

226
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,100
That's where I met Eddie.

227
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,980
He was a radio technician.

228
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,660
We played Liliomfor three performances.

229
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,180
I was awful.

230
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,700
Then the war came and we got married.

231
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,780
Eddie was in the air force.

232
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,260
They sent him to the South Pacific.

233
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:31,180
You were with the OWl, weren't you,
Mr Richards? That's what Who's Who says.

234
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,940
Well, with Eddie gone,
my life went back to beer.

235
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,180
Except for a letter a week.

236
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,420
One week he wrote me
he had leave coming up.

237
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:46,580
I'd saved my money and vacation time
and went to San Francisco to meet him.

238
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,380
But Eddie wasn't there.

239
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,260
They forwarded the telegram from Milwaukee.

240
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,780
The one that came from Washington.

241
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,660
To say that... Eddie wasn't coming at all.

242
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,540
That Eddie was dead.

243
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,780
I figured I'd stay in San Francisco.

244
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:14,140
I was alone. I couldn't go back without Eddie.

245
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,940
I found a job, and his insurance helped.

246
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:22,420
And there were theatres in San Francisco.

247
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,980
And then, one night, Margo Channing
came to play in Remembrance,

248
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,060
and I went to see it.

249
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,100
Well...

250
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,220
Here I am.

251
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:44,980
What a story. Everything but
the bloodhounds snapping at her rear end.

252
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:49,620
There are some human experiences that
do not take place in a vaudeville house!

253
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,820
And that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian
should understand and respect.

254
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:59,420
- I want to apologise for Birdie.
- You don't have to apologise for me.

255
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:07,180
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.
It's just my way of talking.

256
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,780
You didn't hurt my feelings, Miss Coonan.

257
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,860
Call me Birdie.

258
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,780
And as for being fifth-rate,

259
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,900
I closed the first half
for eleven years, and you know it.

260
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,020
47 minutes from now my plane takes off
and how do I find you?

261
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,940
- Not ready, looking like a junkyard.
- Thank you so much.

262
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,260
Is it sabotage?
Have you no human consideration?

263
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:38,020
- Show me a human and I might have.
- Airlines have clocks, even if you don't.

264
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,260
I start shooting a week from Monday.
Zanuck is impatient.

265
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,380
Zanuck, Zanuck! What are you two? Lovers?

266
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,220
- Only in some ways. You're prettier.
- I'm a junkyard.

267
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,460
- Bill. This is Eve Harrington.
- Hi.

268
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:53,940
My wonderful junkyard. The mystery
and dreams you find in a junkyard.

269
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,820
Heaven help me.

270
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,900
I love a psychotic.

271
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:03,380
- Hello. What's your name?
- Eve Harrington.

272
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,940
- You've already met.
- Where?

273
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,980
- Right here, just a minute ago.
- That's nice.

274
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,980
- You're not going, are you?
- I think I'd better.

275
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:20,500
It's been... I can hardly find
the words to say how it's been.

276
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,500
No, don't go.

277
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:27,380
The four of you must have so much to say
to each other with Mr Sampson leaving.

278
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,620
No, stick around, please.

279
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:35,700
Tell you what. We'll put Stanislavsky
on his plane, then go somewhere and talk.

280
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,460
Well, if I'm not in the way...

281
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,540
I won't be a minute.

282
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,420
Lloyd, we've got to go.

283
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,100
Good night, Margo.

284
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,980
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Not too early.

285
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,860
- Good luck, genius.
- Geniuses don't need good luck. I do.

286
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,460
- I'm not worried about you.
- Keep the thought.

287
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,660
Good night, Eve.
I hope I see you again soon.

288
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:15,500
- I'll be at the old stand tomorrow matinée.
- Not just that way. As a friend.

289
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,620
I'd like that.

290
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:24,140
- It's been a real pleasure, Eve.
- I hope so, Mr Richards. Good night.

291
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,500
Good night.

292
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,380
Mrs Richards?

293
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,300
I'll never forget this night as long as I live.

294
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,620
And I'll never forget you
for making it possible.

295
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,580
And I'll never forget you, Eve.

296
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,780
Where were we going that night, Lloyd and I?

297
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,300
Funny, the things you remember...

298
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,380
and the things you don't.

299
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,260
So you're going to Hollywood?

300
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,300
- Why?
- I just wondered.

301
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:09,260
- Just wondered what?
- Why?

302
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:13,300
- Why what?
- Why you have to go out... there.

303
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:17,780
- I don't have to. I want to.
- Is it the money?

304
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,820
80%of it'll go for taxes.

305
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:25,500
Then why? Why, if you're the most
successful young director in the theatre...

306
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,060
The theatre. The theatre.

307
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,660
What rules say the theatre exists
only within some ugly buildings

308
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,420
crowded into one
square mile of New York City?

309
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,500
Or London, Paris or Vienna?

310
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,940
Listen, Junior, and learn.

311
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:45,740
Do you wanna know what the theatre is?
A flea circus. Also opera.

312
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,420
Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets,

313
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,620
Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy,
a one-man band - all theatre.

314
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,500
Wherever there's magic and make-believe
and an audience, there's theatre.

315
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,500
Donald Duck, Ibsen and The Lone Ranger.

316
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:06,700
Sarah Bernhardt and Poodles Hanneford.
Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable.

317
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,780
Rex the Wild Horse, Eleonora Duse -
all theatre.

318
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:13,180
You don't understand them all.
You don't like them all.

319
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:18,180
Why should you? The theatre's for everybody
- you included - but not exclusively.

320
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,820
So, don't approve or disapprove.

321
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:24,580
It may not be your theatre,
but it's theatre for somebody, somewhere.

322
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:27,060
I just asked a simple question.

323
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,700
And I shot my mouth off.

324
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,740
Nothing personal, Junior. No offence.

325
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:38,980
It's just that there's so much bushwa in
this ivory greenroom they call the theatre,

326
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,380
sometimes it gets up around my chin.

327
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,740
But Hollywood. You mustn't stay out there.

328
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:48,340
- It's only a one-picture deal.
- So few come back.

329
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,060
I read George Jean Nathan every week.

330
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,420
- Also Addison DeWitt.
- Every day.

331
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,820
You didn't have to tell me.

332
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,900
It's the latest thing - one earring.

333
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,820
If it isn't, it's going to be.
I can't find the other one.

334
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,340
Throw that dreary letter away. It bores me.

335
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,500
- Where do you suppose it could be?
- It'll show up.

336
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:16,660
I give up. Look in the wigs.
Maybe it got caught in one.

337
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,460
Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in.

338
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:22,340
- Where's my coat?
- Right where you left it.

339
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,460
The seams.

340
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,780
He can't take his eyes off my legs.

341
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,860
Like a nylon lemon peel.

342
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,980
Byron couldn't have said it more graciously.

343
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,060
Here we go.

344
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:42,540
Got any messages?
What do you want me to tell Tyrone Power?

345
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,820
Just give him my phone number.
I'll tell him myself.

346
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,460
Kill the people.

347
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,580
- You got your key?
- See you at home.

348
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:01,060
I have a suggestion.
There's really not very much time left.

349
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,740
I mean, you haven't had a minute alone yet.

350
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:08,060
And I could take care of everything here
and meet you at the gate with the ticket...

351
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,100
if you'd like.

352
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,980
I think we'd like very much.

353
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,460
- Sure you won't mind?
- Of course not.

354
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,940
- She's quite a girl, this whatshername.
- Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way.

355
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,940
That lack of pretence,
that strange directness and understanding.

356
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,580
Did she tell you about
the theatre and what it meant?

357
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,980
No, I told her. I sounded off.

358
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,900
All the religions in the world rolled into one,

359
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,340
and we're gods and goddesses.

360
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:46,900
Isn't it silly? Suddenly I've developed
a big, protective feeling toward her.

361
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,580
A lamb loose in our big, stone jungle.

362
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:59,020
- Take care of yourself out there.
- They have the Indians pretty well in hand.

363
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:03,300
- Bill, don't get stuck on some glamour puss.
- I'll try.

364
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:06,980
You're not much of a bargain. You're
conceited, thoughtless and messy.

365
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:12,060
- Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
- You're a setup for some young babe.

366
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,580
How childish are you gonna get
before you stop it?

367
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,260
I don't wanna be childish.
I'd settle for a few years.

368
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,420
And cut that out right now.

369
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,460
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?

370
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,900
As of this moment, you're six years old.

371
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,580
All ready.

372
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,940
Thanks for your help. Good luck.

373
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,100
Goodbye, Mr Sampson.

374
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,980
- Knit me a muffler?
- Call me when you get in.

375
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,100
Hey, Junior!

376
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:12,420
Keep your eye on her. Don't let her get lonely.
She's a loose lamb in a jungle.

377
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,500
Don't worry.

378
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:32,260
That same night, we sent for Eve's things...
her few pitiful possessions.

379
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,700
She moved into the little guest room
on the top floor.

380
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:43,660
The next three weeks were out of a fairy tale,
and I was Cinderella in the last act.

381
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:49,220
Eve became my sister, lawyer, mother,
friend, psychiatrist and cop.

382
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,860
The honeymoon was on.

383
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,780
One more?

384
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,860
From now on it isn't applause -

385
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:04,140
just something to do
till the aisles get cleared.

386
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,900
What, again?

387
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:14,860
I could watch you play that last scene
a thousand times, cry every time.

388
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:18,660
Performance number 1,000 of this one,
if I play it that long,

389
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,900
will take place in a well-padded booby hatch.

390
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:28,660
I must say, you can certainly tell
Mr Sampson's been gone a month.

391
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,780
You certainly can.

392
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:34,540
Especially if you're me
between now and tomorrow morning.

393
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,740
You bought the new girdles a size smaller.
I can feel it.

394
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,220
Something maybe grew a size larger.

395
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:43,620
You can get into one of those girdles
and act for two and a half hours.

396
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:47,180
I couldn't get into the girdle
in two and a half hours.

397
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:56,180
You haven't noticed my latest bit
of interior decorating.

398
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:59,860
But you've done so much. What's new?

399
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,340
The curtains. I made them myself.

400
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:07,100
They're lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?

401
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,540
Adorable.

402
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:12,620
We now got everything a dressing room
needs except a basketball hoop.

403
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,940
Just because you can't even work a zipper!

404
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:18,300
It was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
I appreciate it.

405
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,060
I'll just take this to the wardrobe mistress.

406
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:25,300
- Don't bother. Mrs Brown will be along soon.
- No trouble at all.

407
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:33,460
May I be so bold as to say something?

408
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:37,140
- Have you ever heard of the word "union"?
- Behind in your dues? How much?

409
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:40,540
- I haven't got a union. I'm slave labour.
- Well?

410
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,620
But the wardrobe women have got one
and, next to a tenor,

411
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:47,540
a wardrobe woman is the
touchiest thing in show business.

412
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,540
She's got two things to do:
carry clothes and press 'em wrong.

413
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:54,740
And don't let anybody try to muscle in.

414
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,220
Eve.

415
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,100
We'd better let Mrs Brown
pick up the wardrobe.

416
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,540
- Hello.
- We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills.

417
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:46,660
- Call? What call?
- Is this Templeton 89970? Miss Channing?

418
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,900
Yes, it is, but I don't understand.

419
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:53,860
We are ready with the call you placedfor
12 midnight, California time, to Mr Sampson.

420
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,700
- I placed?
- Go ahead, please.

421
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:00,220
Margo, what a wonderful surprise.

422
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,460
What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do.

423
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:07,020
Bill. Have I gone crazy, Bill?

424
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,620
- You're my girl, aren't you?
- That I am.

425
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,700
Then you're crazy.

426
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,860
- When are you coming back?
- I leave in a week.

427
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,620
The picture's wrapped up.
We previewed last night.

428
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,860
Oh, those previews.

429
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:24,860
Like opening out of town, but terrifying.
There's nothing you can do.

430
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,980
You're trapped. You're in a tin can.

431
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:32,500
In a tin can, cellophane or wrapped
in a Navajo blanket, I want you home.

432
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:37,220
- You in a hurry?
- In a big hurry, so be quick about it.

433
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,140
Goodbye, darling. Sleep tight.

434
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:43,020
Hey, wait a minute.
You haven't even said it yet.

435
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,860
Now, Bill. You know how much I do,
but over a phone...

436
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,940
Now, really. That's kids' stuff.

437
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:54,620
Kids' stuff or not. It doesn't happen
every day and I wanna hear it.

438
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,660
- And if you won't say it, you can sing it.
- Sing it?

439
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,540
Sure, like the Western Union boys used to do.

440
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,540
Bill...

441
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,460
It's your birthday.

442
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:14,500
And who remembered it?
Who was there on the dot at12 midnight?

443
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,460
Happy birthday, darling.

444
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:19,780
The reading could've been better,
but you said it.

445
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:22,020
Now "many happy returns of the day".

446
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,900
Many happy returns of the day.

447
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:29,820
- I get a party, don't I?
- Of course. Birthday and coming home.

448
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:33,620
- Who will I ask?
- I know all about the party. Eve wrote me.

449
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,140
- She did?
- She hasn't missed a week since I left.

450
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,820
But you know that.
You probably tell her what to write.

451
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:45,180
- I sent her a list of guests, so check with her.
- Yeah, I will.

452
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:48,700
- How is Eve? OK?
- OK.

453
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:51,380
- I love you.
- I'll check with Eve.

454
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:56,740
I love you too. Good night, darling.

455
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,100
See ya.

456
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,260
Birdie.

457
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,460
You don't like Eve, do you?

458
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,740
You want an argument or an answer?

459
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,340
- An answer.
- No.

460
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,820
- Why not?
- Now you want an argument.

461
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,900
- She works hard.
- Night and day.

462
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:03,180
- She's loyal and efficient.
- Like an agent with only one client.

463
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,380
She thinks only of me,

464
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:10,140
doesn't she?

465
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:13,580
Well, let's say she thinks
only about ya, anyway.

466
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:16,540
- How do you mean that?
- I'll tell ya how.

467
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,060
Like...

468
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,060
Like she's studying you.

469
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:24,220
Like you was a play, or a book,
or a set of blueprints.

470
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,420
How you walk, talk, eat, think...

471
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:30,340
I'm sure that's flattering.
There's nothing wrong with it.

472
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:35,900
Good morning. Well, what do
you think of my elegant new suit?

473
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:38,300
It looks much better on you than it did on me.

474
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:42,980
I can imagine. All it needed was
a little taking in here and letting out there.

475
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:48,020
- Are you sure you won't want it yourself?
- Quite sure. I find it too seventeenish for me.

476
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,340
Come now, as though you were an old lady.

477
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,820
I'm on my way. Is there anything else?

478
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,220
- That script to take to the Guild.
- I've got it.

479
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,740
And those cheques for the income-tax man.

480
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,820
Right here.

481
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:03,500
It seems I can't think of a thing
you haven't thought of.

482
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:06,180
That's my job. See you at teatime.

483
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,020
Eve?

484
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:15,500
Did you place a call from me to Bill
for midnight California time?

485
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:19,620
- Golly, I forgot to tell you!
- Yes, dear, you forgot all about it.

486
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,420
I was sure you'd want to, being his birthday.

487
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:27,140
You've been so busy lately. Last night
I meant to tell you before you went out.

488
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,700
I guess I was asleep when you got home.

489
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:32,980
Yes, I guess you were.
It was very thoughtful of you, Eve.

490
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:38,060
Mr Sampson's birthday, I couldn't forget that.
You'd never forgive me.

491
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,980
As a matter of fact,
I sent him a telegram myself.

492
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:18,180
Bill's welcome-home birthday party...
a night to go down in history.

493
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:22,660
Even before the party started,
I could smell disaster in the air.

494
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:28,180
I knew it. I sensed it even as lfinished
dressing for that blasted party.

495
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,100
- You all put together?
- My back's open.

496
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:36,020
- Extra help get here?
- There's some characters

497
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:39,820
dressed as maids and butlers.
Did you call the William Morris Agency?

498
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,060
You're not funny. Actors would cost less.
How about the food?

499
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,660
The caterer had to go back
for the hors d'oeuvres.

500
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,420
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot.

501
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,260
There was nothing he didn't know.

502
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,020
There's a message from the bartender.

503
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:03,620
"Does Miss Channing know that
she ordered domestic gin by mistake?"

504
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,380
The only thing I ordered
by mistake is the guests.

505
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:09,340
They don't care what they drink
as long as it burns.

506
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:12,220
- Where's Bill? He's late.
- Late for what?

507
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:16,420
- Don't be dense. The party.
- I ain't dense. He's been here for 20 minutes.

508
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,300
Well, I certainly think it's odd
he hasn't even come up to...

509
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,740
The cameraman said:

510
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:43,860
"Even De Mille couldn't see anything
looking through the wrong end!" So...

511
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:46,900
Don't let me kill the point.
Or isn't it a story for grown-ups?

512
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:50,060
You've heard it. I looked through
the wrong end of the camera.

513
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:54,100
Remind me to tell you about the time
I looked into the heart of an artichoke.

514
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:58,460
- I'd like to hear it.
- Some snowy night in front of the fire.

515
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:01,540
Meanwhile, would you check
about the hors d'oeuvres, Eve?

516
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:04,780
The caterer forgot them.
The varnish wasn't dry or something.

517
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,860
Of course.

518
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,380
Looks like I'm going
to have a fancy party.

519
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:23,140
- I thought you were going to be late.
- Well, I'm guest of honour.

520
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,180
I had no idea you were even here.

521
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:28,300
I ran into Eve
and she told me you were dressing.

522
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,780
That's never stopped you before.

523
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:35,660
She wanted to know about Hollywood.
She seemed so interested...

524
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:39,660
- She's a girl of so many interests.
- It's a pretty rare quality these days.

525
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:43,060
- A girl of so many rare qualities.
- So she seems.

526
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,340
So you've pointed out so often.

527
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,380
So many qualities so often.

528
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:51,580
Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth
and affection, and so young.

529
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,660
So young and so fair.

530
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,700
I can't believe you're making this up.

531
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,780
It sounds like something
out of an old Clyde Fitch play.

532
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:04,580
Clyde Fitch, though you may not think so,
was well before my time.

533
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:08,780
I always deny that you were in Our American
Cousin the night Lincoln was shot.

534
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,740
- I don't think that's funny.
- Of course it is.

535
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,300
This is all too laughable to be anything else.

536
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,740
You know what I feel
about your age obsession.

537
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:21,420
And this getting into a jealous froth because
I spent ten minutes with a stage-struck kid.

538
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,820
- 20!
- 30 minutes, 40 minutes. What of it?

539
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,300
Stage-struck. She's a young lady of qualities.

540
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:30,220
And I'm fed up with both
the young lady and her qualities.

541
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,580
Studying me as if I were a play or a blueprint.

542
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,540
How I walk, talk, think, act, sleep.

543
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:40,340
How can you take offence at a kid
trying to be like her ideal?

544
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,820
Stop calling her a kid.

545
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:47,940
As it happens, there are
particular aspects of my life

546
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:52,060
to which I would like to maintain
sole and exclusive rights and privileges.

547
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:55,260
- For instance, what?
- For instance, you.

548
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:01,180
This is my cue to take you
in my arms and reassure you.

549
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,060
But I'm not going to. I'm too mad.

550
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,620
- Guilty!
- Mad!

551
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:08,740
There are certain characteristics
for which you are famous, on stage and off.

552
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:13,100
I love you for some and in spite of others.
I haven't let those become too important.

553
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:17,660
They're part of your equipment for getting
along in what is called "our environment".

554
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:20,220
You have to keep your teeth sharp, all right.

555
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:23,140
But I will not have you
sharpen them on me, or on Eve.

556
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:27,580
- What about her teeth? Her fangs?
- She hasn't cut them yet and you know it!

557
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,660
So when you start judging
an idealistic, dreamy-eyed kid

558
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:35,740
by the bar-room, Benzedrine standards of
this megalomaniac society, I won't have it!

559
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:39,260
Eve Harrington has never by word,
look, thought or suggestion

560
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:43,740
indicated anything to me but adoration
for you and happiness at our being in love.

561
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:48,540
To intimate anything else spells a paranoiac
insecurity that you should be ashamed of.

562
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:53,420
Cut. Print it. What happens in the next reel?
Do I get dragged off to the snake pits?

563
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,500
Miss Channing?

564
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:01,580
The hors d'oeuvres are here.
Is there anything else I can do?

565
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:08,740
Thank you, Eve. I'd like a martini, very dry.

566
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,820
I'll get it.

567
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:15,180
- What'll you have?
- A milk shake?

568
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,660
A martini, very dry, please.

569
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,660
- The party's on the first floor.
- Hi, Bill.

570
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:28,020
- Hello, Mrs Richards.
- How are you, dear?

571
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,820
Good evening, Mr Richards. Mr Fabian.

572
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,140
- May I have your coat?
- I'll take it up.

573
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,220
- Please.
- Thank you.

574
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,740
- Hi.
- Hi, Margo.

575
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:41,220
- The house looks lovely.
- I like that girl.

576
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,340
That quality of quiet graciousness.

577
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:46,140
Among so many quiet qualities.

578
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,060
Shall we?

579
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:53,140
- It's made me so happy your taking Eve in.
- I'm so happy you're happy.

580
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:58,140
You haven't been running a settlement house
exactly. The kid has earned her way.

581
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,820
You had a mixed-up inventory
when she took over.

582
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,100
Merchandise laying all over the shop.

583
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:06,940
- You mixed Margo up with a five-and-ten.
- Make it Bergdorf Goodman.

584
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:10,740
Everything on its proper shelf, eh, Max?
All done up in little ribbons.

585
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,660
I could die right now
and nobody'd be confused.

586
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,940
- How about you, Max?
- How about me what?

587
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:19,020
Suppose you dropped dead.
What about your inventory?

588
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:23,180
I ain't going to drop dead. Not with the heat.

589
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,940
This is the most ghoulish conversation.

590
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:28,060
- Thank you.
- Nothing.

591
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,060
Max!

592
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,460
Fife!

593
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:36,820
"The kid" will be down in a minute, unless
you'd like to take her drink up to her.

594
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:40,540
I can get a fresh one...
Karen, you're a Gibson girl.

595
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:43,340
The general atmosphere is very Macbethish.

596
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:46,420
- What has or is about to happen?
- What is he talking about?

597
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,820
- Macbeth.
- We've seen you like this before.

598
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,300
Is it over or is it just beginning?

599
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:05,540
Fasten your seat belts.
It's going to be a bumpy night.

600
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,580
- Margo, darling!
- How are you?

601
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:15,540
Enchantée to you too.

602
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:19,820
I remember, Addison, crossing you off
my guest list. What are you doing here?

603
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:24,060
Dear Margo, you were an unforgettable
Peter Pan. You must play it again soon.

604
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,580
- Remember Miss Caswell?
- I do not. How do you do?

605
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:29,700
- We've never met. Maybe that's why.
- She is an actress.

606
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:32,980
A graduate of the Copacabana
School of Dramatic Art.

607
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,260
Eve.

608
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:39,580
- Good evening, Mr DeWitt.
- I had no idea you knew each other.

609
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:42,340
This must be, at long last,
our formal introduction.

610
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:47,060
- Until now, we've only met in passing.
- That's how you met me. In passing.

611
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:49,500
Eve, this is an old friend
of Mr DeWitt's mother.

612
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:52,900
- Miss Caswell, Miss Harrington.
- How do you do?

613
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,740
I've been wanting you
to meet Eve for the longest time.

614
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:58,780
Your timidity must have
kept you from mentioning it.

615
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:02,140
- You know of her interest in the theatre?
- We have that in common.

616
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:04,060
Then you two must have a long talk.

617
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:07,060
I'm afraid Mr DeWitt would find me
boring before too long.

618
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:10,500
You won't bore him, honey.
You won't even get a chance to talk.

619
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,540
Claudia, come here.

620
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:17,300
You see that man?
That's Max Fabian, the producer.

621
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:19,620
Now, go and do yourself some good.

622
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,340
Why do they always look
like unhappy rabbits?

623
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:26,020
Cos that's what they are.
Now go and make him happier.

624
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:32,820
Now, don't worry about your little charge.
She'll be in safe hands.

625
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,180
Amen!

626
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:29,460
- Liebestraum.
- I just played it.

627
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:32,700
- Play it again.
- But that was the fourth straight time.

628
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,940
Then this will be five.

629
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:42,020
Many of your guests are wondering when
they may be permitted to view the body.

630
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:46,180
- Where has it been laid out?
- It hasn't been laid out.

631
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:49,380
We haven't finished with the embalming.

632
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:52,340
As a matter of fact, you're looking at it.

633
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:55,140
The remains of Margo Channing...

634
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,020
sitting up.

635
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:01,460
It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.

636
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:03,940
Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?

637
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:08,220
You know nothing about feelings,
natural or unnatural.

638
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:11,780
Your guests were also wondering
whether the music couldn't be

639
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:15,060
a shade more on the...
shall we say, happier side?

640
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:20,540
If my guests do not like it here,
I suggest they accompany you to the nursery

641
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:24,300
where I'm sure you will all feel more at home.

642
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:29,140
Margo, you by any chance haven't got
any bicarbonate of soda in the house?

643
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:32,420
Poor Max. Heartburn?

644
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:35,780
It's that Miss Caswell.

645
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:38,900
I don't see why she hasn't
given Addison heartburn.

646
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:44,420
- No heart to burn.
- Everybody has a heart, except some people.

647
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:47,620
Of course I've got bicarb.

648
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:50,100
I've got a box in the pantry.

649
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:53,620
We'll put your name on it. "Max Fabian."

650
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:57,940
It will stay there always, just for you.

651
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:02,260
Let the rest of the world
beat their brains out for a buck.

652
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:04,380
It's friends that count.

653
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:09,100
- And I have friends.
- I love you, Max. I really mean it.

654
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:11,340
I love you.

655
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:13,620
Come to the pantry.

656
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:17,260
She loves me like a father. Also, she's loaded.

657
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:34,220
There you are, Maxie dear.

658
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:37,300
One good burp
and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell.

659
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:40,820
The situation I'm in ain't the kind
you can belch your way out of.

660
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:44,180
- I made a promise.
- To Miss Caswell? What?

661
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:46,860
For an audition for this part we are replacing.

662
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:48,900
What's her name? Your sister?

663
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:51,260
- One?
- No, two, please.

664
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:53,580
If she can act, she might not be bad.

665
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:56,660
She looks like she might
burn down a plantation.

666
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:59,460
Right now, I feel like
there is one burning in me.

667
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:02,380
- When's the audition?
- A couple of weeks.

668
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:06,020
Tell you what. Why don't I read with her?

669
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:09,700
- Would you?
- Anything to help you out, Max.

670
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:12,700
Now that's cooperation. I appreciate it.

671
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:16,420
Not at all. And now you
can do me a great favour.

672
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,540
Just name it.

673
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:21,820
Give Eve Harrington a job in your office.

674
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:27,820
You get quick action, don't you?

675
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:30,700
I wouldn't think of taking
that girl away from you.

676
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:35,340
You said yourself my inventory was in shape,
all my merchandise put away.

677
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:38,860
To keep her here with nothing to do,
I'd be standing in her way.

678
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:41,740
- And you need her, Max.
- What will she do?

679
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:44,540
She'd be a great help. She'd read scripts,

680
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:48,940
interview people you have to see,
get rid of those you don't have to.

681
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:51,500
You'd be a man of leisure, Maxie.

682
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:53,860
- Well...
- Think of your health.

683
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:57,340
More time to relax
in the fresh air at a racetrack.

684
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:00,860
- I don't think it's such a good idea.
- Promise?

685
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:02,940
- Promise.
- That's my Max.

686
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,300
There you both are.

687
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:08,500
Max, Karen's decided it's time to go.

688
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:11,100
- Where is she now?
- Up in your room.

689
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:14,380
If you'll excuse me,
I'll go and tell Miss Caswell.

690
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:20,460
- Who's left out there?
- Too many.

691
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:23,900
And, besides, you got a new guest.
A movie star from Hollywood.

692
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:28,500
Shucks! And I sent
my autograph book to the cleaners.

693
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:35,100
You disapprove of me
when I'm like this, don't you?

694
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:39,660
Not exactly. Sometimes, though,
I wish I understood you better.

695
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:42,140
- When you do, let me in on it.
- I will.

696
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:48,220
- How's the new one coming?
- The play? Oh, all right, I guess.

697
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:52,460
Cora. Still a girl of 20?

698
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:54,540
20-ish. It's not important.

699
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:57,300
Don't you think it's about time
it became important?

700
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:00,420
- How do you mean?
- Don't be evasive.

701
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,860
Margo, you haven't got any age.

702
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:06,460
Miss Channing is ageless.
Spoken like a press agent.

703
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:09,260
I know what I'm talking about.
They're my plays.

704
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,340
Spoken like an author.

705
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:15,380
Lloyd, I'm not 20-ish. I'm not 30-ish.

706
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:18,180
Three months ago I was 40 years old.

707
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:20,740
40! Four-0.

708
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:28,100
That slipped out.
I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it.

709
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:33,540
Now I suddenly feel as if
I've taken all my clothes off.

710
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:39,300
To thousands of people
you're as young as you want.

711
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:42,020
As young as they want, you mean.

712
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:45,820
I'm not interested whether thousands
of people think I'm six or 600.

713
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:48,300
Just one person, isn't that so?

714
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:55,780
You know what this is all about. It has little
to do with whether you should play Cora.

715
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:58,860
It has everything to do with
you having a fight with Bill.

716
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:01,900
Bill's 32. He looks 32.

717
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:06,300
He looked it five years ago.
He'll look it 20 years from now.

718
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:08,380
I hate men.

719
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:13,660
Don't worry, Lloyd. I'll play your play.

720
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:17,860
I'll wear rompers and come in
rolling a hoop, if you like.

721
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:25,180
Who'd show up at this hour?
It's time people went home.

722
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:29,380
Hold that coat up.

723
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:35,460
- Whose is it?
- Some Hollywood movie star.

724
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:38,780
- Her plane got in late.
- Discouraging, isn't it?

725
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:42,100
Women with furs like that
where it never even gets cold.

726
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:44,180
Hollywood.

727
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:50,020
Tell me, Eve. How are things
going with you? Happy?

728
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:52,260
There should be a new word for happiness.

729
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:55,940
Being here with Miss Channing
has been a... I just can't say.

730
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:59,340
She's been so wonderful,
done so much for me.

731
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:06,180
Lloyd says Margo compensates for
underplaying on stage by overplaying reality.

732
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:10,980
Next to that sable, my new mink
seems like an old bed jacket.

733
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:16,260
You've done your share, Eve. You've
worked wonders with Margo. Good night.

734
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:19,060
- Mrs Richards?
- Karen.

735
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:21,020
Karen.

736
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:24,580
Isn't it awful? I'm about
to ask you for another favour,

737
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:26,580
after all you've done already.

738
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:28,500
Nobody's done so much.

739
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:32,100
Stop thinking of yourself
as one of the hundred neediest cases.

740
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:36,140
- What is it?
- Miss Channing's affairs are in good shape,

741
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:39,220
so there isn't enough
to keep me as busy as I should be.

742
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:42,500
Not that I'd consider anything
that would take me away from her.

743
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:46,020
But the other day
when Mr Fabian told Miss Channing

744
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:50,460
that her understudy was going to have
a baby and they'd have to replace her...

745
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:55,100
- You wanna be Margo's new understudy?
- I don't let myself think about it even.

746
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:58,620
But I do know the part so well,
and every bit of the staging,

747
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:01,500
there'd be no need to break in a new girl.

748
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:05,180
Suppose I had to go on one night

749
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:08,420
to an audience that came
to see Margo Channing.

750
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:11,900
- I couldn't possibly.
- I wouldn't worry too much about that.

751
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:17,380
Margo just doesn't miss performances.
If she can walk, crawl or roll, she plays.

752
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:21,780
- The show must go on.
- No, dear. Margo must go on.

753
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:24,900
I don't see any reason
why you shouldn't be her understudy.

754
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:28,420
- You think Miss Channing would approve?
- I think she'd cheer.

755
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:32,660
- But Mr Richards and Mr Sampson?
- They'll do as they're told.

756
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:36,620
Then... would you speak
to Mr Fabian about it?

757
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:39,380
- Of course.
- You won't forget?

758
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:41,660
I won't forget.

759
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:47,620
I seem to be forever
thanking you for something, don't I?

760
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:58,100
The bed looks like a dead animal act.

761
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:01,500
- Which one is sable?
- But she just got here.

762
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:05,020
Well, she's on her way
with half the men in the joint.

763
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:08,580
- It's only a fur coat.
- What do you expect? Live sable?

764
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:12,660
Diamond collar, gold sleeves.
You know - picture people.

765
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:17,300
Elder statesmen of the theatre or cinema

766
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:21,700
assure the public that actors
and actresses are just plain folks,

767
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:25,220
ignoring the fact that their greatest
attraction to the public

768
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:28,820
is their complete lack of resemblance
to normal human beings.

769
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:32,180
Now there's something
a girl could make sacrifices for.

770
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:34,660
- And probably has.
- Sable.

771
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:38,100
- Sable? Did she say sable or Gable?
- Either one.

772
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:41,220
We all have abnormality in common.

773
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:44,980
We're a breed apart from the rest
of humanity, we theatre folk.

774
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:48,180
We are the original displaced personalities.

775
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:51,940
You won't have to read his column
tomorrow, Eve. You just heard it.

776
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:56,180
- I don't agree, Addison.
- That's your particular abnormality.

777
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:58,900
I admit there's a screwball
element in the theatre.

778
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:02,860
It sticks out, it's got spotlights
on it and a brass band.

779
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:07,900
But it isn't basic. It isn't standard.
If it were, the theatre couldn't survive.

780
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:12,220
- Waiter.
- That isn't a waiter, my dear. That's a butler.

781
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,620
Well, I can't yell out "butler", can I?

782
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:17,180
Maybe somebody's name is Butler.

783
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:20,740
You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point.

784
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:24,620
I don't wanna make trouble.
All I want is a drink.

785
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:28,340
- Leave it to me. I'll get you one.
- Thank you, Mr Fabian.

786
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:33,620
Well done. I can see your career
rising in the east like the sun.

787
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:39,940
- You were saying?
- The theatre is nine-tenths hard work.

788
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:44,580
Work done the hard way - by sweat,
application and craftsmanship.

789
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:48,220
To be a good actor or actress,
or anything in the theatre,

790
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:51,020
means wanting to be that
more than anything else.

791
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:53,260
Yes. Yes, it does.

792
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:56,980
It means a concentration
of desire or ambition and sacrifice

793
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:59,260
such as no other profession demands.

794
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:03,060
And the man or woman who accepts
those terms can't be ordinary,

795
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:05,220
can't be just someone.

796
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:08,140
To give so much for almost always so little.

797
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:10,420
"So little"?

798
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,580
"So little", did you say?

799
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:17,020
Why, if there's nothing else,
there's applause.

800
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:20,260
I've listened backstage to people applaud.

801
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:22,180
It's like...

802
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:26,940
Like waves of love coming over
the footlights and wrapping you up.

803
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:32,220
Imagine - to know every night
that different hundreds of people love you.

804
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:36,340
They smile, their eyes shine,
you've pleased them.

805
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:39,420
They want you. You belong.

806
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:43,740
Just that alone is worth anything.

807
00:56:57,020 --> 00:57:01,500
Don't get up. And please stop acting
as if I were the Queen Mother.

808
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:04,420
- I'm sorry, I didn't...
- Outside of a beehive, Margo,

809
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:07,540
your behaviour is hardly queenly or motherly.

810
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:09,620
You're in a beehive, pal.

811
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:14,140
We're all busy little bees, full of stings,
making honey day and night.

812
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:16,260
- Aren't we, honey?
- Margo, really.

813
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:19,100
Please don't play governess, Karen.

814
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:22,540
I haven't your unyielding good taste.

815
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:27,100
I wish I could have gone to Radcliffe, too,
but Father wouldn't hear of it.

816
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:29,820
He needed help behind a notions counter.

817
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:33,860
I'm being rude now, aren't I?
Or should I say, ain't I?

818
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:37,740
You're maudlin and full of self-pity.
You're magnificent.

819
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:40,180
How about calling it a night?

820
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:42,740
And you pose as a playwright.

821
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:47,260
A situation pregnant with possibilities,
and all you can think of is "go to sleep".

822
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:50,540
- It's a good thought.
- It won't play.

823
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:55,340
As a nonprofessional,
I think it's an excellent idea. Excuse me.

824
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:59,060
Undramatic, perhaps, but practical.

825
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:01,860
- Happy little housewife.
- Cut it out.

826
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:06,660
This is my house, not a theatre.
In my house you're a guest, not a director.

827
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:10,420
Then stop being a star and treating
your guests as your supporting cast.

828
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:13,060
- Let's not get into a big hassle.
- It's time we did.

829
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:17,140
Margo has to realise what's attractive
on stage need not be attractive off.

830
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:19,620
All right!

831
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:21,740
I'm going to bed.

832
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:33,020
You be host. It's your party.
Happy birthday. Welcome home.

833
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:35,620
And we who are about to die salute you.

834
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:37,700
Need any help?

835
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:46,740
To put me to bed?
Take my clothes off, hold my head?

836
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:51,020
Tuck me in, turn out the lights
and tiptoe out?

837
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:54,980
Eve would, wouldn't you, Eve?

838
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:57,580
- If you'd like.
- I wouldn't like.

839
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:07,260
- I forgot I had it.
- I didn't.

840
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:17,660
Too bad. We're gonna miss the third act.

841
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:20,140
They're gonna play it offstage.

842
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:25,420
- Coming, Max?
- In a minute.

843
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:32,580
Eve, you mustn't mind Margo
too much, even if I do.

844
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:35,900
There must be some reason,
something I've done without knowing.

845
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:39,740
The reason is Margo and don't try
to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.

846
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:42,260
But if I thought I'd offended her,
of all people...

847
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:47,780
Eve... I'm fond of Margo, too.
But I know Margo. And every now and then,

848
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:52,780
there is nothing I wanna do so much
as kick her right square in the pants.

849
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:55,340
Well, if she has to pick on someone,

850
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:57,820
I'd just as soon it was me.

851
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:02,860
- Max is gonna drop us.
- Good night.

852
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:05,020
- Good night.
- Good night.

853
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:09,740
Mrs Richards? You won't forget, will you?
What we talked about before?

854
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:11,820
No, Eve. I won't forget.

855
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:39,100
Why so remote, Addison?

856
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:42,620
You should be at the side of
your protégée, lending her moral support.

857
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:46,620
Miss Caswell is where I can
lend no support, moral or otherwise.

858
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:48,820
In the ladies' shall we say "lounge"?

859
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:51,140
Being violently ill to her tummy.

860
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:53,580
It's good luck before an audition.

861
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:56,660
Miss Caswell got lucky too late.
The audition is over.

862
01:00:56,740 --> 01:01:00,340
It can't be. I came here to read
with Miss Caswell. I promised Max.

863
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:02,860
The audition was at 2.30.
It's now nearly four.

864
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:06,500
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch.
I never have, you know.

865
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:08,820
Who read with Miss Caswell?

866
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:11,420
- Bill? Lloyd?
- No.

867
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:15,140
- Well, it can't have been Max. Who?
- Naturally, your understudy.

868
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:18,660
It's unnatural to allow a girl
in an advanced state of pregnancy...

869
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:23,500
I refer to your new and unpregnant
understudy, Miss Eve Harrington.

870
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:26,140
Eve? My understudy?

871
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:29,820
- Didn't you know?
- Of course I knew.

872
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:31,900
It just slipped your mind?

873
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:38,020
How... was Miss Caswell?

874
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:40,740
Frankly, I don't remember.

875
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:43,340
- Just slipped your mind?
- Completely.

876
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:46,620
Nor can anyone else present
tell you how Miss Caswell read,

877
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:49,580
or whether Miss Caswell read
or rode a pogo stick.

878
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:51,780
Was she that bad?

879
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:56,300
Margo, I have lived in the theatre
as a Trappist monk lives in his faith.

880
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:58,980
I have no other world, no other life.

881
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:02,020
Once in a great while,
I experience that moment of revelation

882
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:05,060
for which all true believers
wait and pray. You were one.

883
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:10,780
Jeanne Eagels another, Paula Wessely,
Hayes. There are others, three or four.

884
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:13,060
Eve Harrington will be among them.

885
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:15,180
I take it she read well.

886
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:17,540
It wasn't a reading, it was a performance.

887
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:21,100
Brilliant, vivid,
something made of music and fire.

888
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:23,220
How nice.

889
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:26,060
In time, she'll be what you are.

890
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:28,540
A mass of music and fire.

891
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:32,620
That's me. An old kazoo with some sparklers.

892
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:38,460
Tell me, was... Bill swept away too?

893
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:42,700
- Or were you too full of revelation to notice?
- Bill didn't say.

894
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:47,540
But Lloyd listened to his play as if
it had been written by someone else, he said.

895
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:50,780
It sounded so fresh,
so new, so full of meaning.

896
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:55,540
How nice for Lloyd. How nice for Eve.
How nice for everybody.

897
01:02:56,140 --> 01:03:00,140
Eve was incredibly modest.
She insisted that no credit was due her.

898
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:04,300
That Lloyd felt as he did because she read
his lines exactly as he'd written them.

899
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:07,460
The implication being
that I did not read them as written?

900
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:11,860
Neither your name nor your performance
entered the conversation.

901
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:20,140
Feeling better, my dear?

902
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:26,340
Like I just swam the English Channel.
Now what?

903
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:30,420
Your next move, it seems to me,
should be towards television.

904
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:37,460
Tell me this.
Do they have auditions for television?

905
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:41,380
That's all television is, my dear.
Nothing but auditions.

906
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:47,980
Margo, darling.

907
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:02,660
Terribly sorry I was late.
Lunch was long and I couldn't find a cab.

908
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:05,980
- Where's Miss Caswell? Oh, hello, Eve.
- Hello, Miss Channing.

909
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:08,580
How are you making out
in Mr Fabian's office?

910
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:13,060
Now, Max, I don't want you working this child
too hard just because you promised.

911
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:16,140
As you see, I kept my promise, too.

912
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:18,420
It's all over.

913
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:21,460
- What's all over?
- The audition.

914
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:26,060
- Eve read with Miss Caswell.
- Eve? How enchanting.

915
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:29,420
How did you get the idea of letting
Eve read with Miss Caswell?

916
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:33,540
- Well, she's your understudy.
- Eve? My understudy? I had no idea.

917
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:35,780
I thought you knew. She started a week ago.

918
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:41,860
I've never seen her backstage, but with
so many people loitering about... Well, well.

919
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:44,540
So Eve is not working for Max, after all.

920
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:48,020
Max, you sly puss.

921
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:54,860
Miss Channing, I can't tell you
how glad I am that you arrived so late.

922
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:58,940
- Really, Eve? Why?
- Otherwise, I never would have dared to read.

923
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:01,460
- Why not?
- If you'd come in the middle,

924
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:03,540
I couldn't have gone on.

925
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:07,460
What a pity.
All that fire and music being turned off.

926
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:09,980
- What fire and music?
- You wouldn't understand.

927
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:12,060
How was Miss Caswell?

928
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:14,180
Back to the Copacabana.

929
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:16,860
But Eve, Margo. Let me tell you about Eve.

930
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:22,300
I was dreadful, Miss Channing. I have no right
to be anyone's understudy, much less yours.

931
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:24,980
I'm sure you underestimate yourself.
You always do.

932
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:26,980
You were about to tell me about Eve.

933
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:29,060
- You'd have been proud of her.
- I'm sure.

934
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:31,700
- She was a revelation.
- To you too?

935
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:35,020
- What do you mean by that?
- It must have been a revelation

936
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:38,820
to have a 24-year-old character
played by a 24-year-old actress.

937
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:41,260
- That's beside the point.
- It is the point.

938
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:43,580
It must have seemed so new and fresh to you,

939
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:46,820
so exciting, to have your lines
read just as you wrote them.

940
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:50,020
- Addison.
- So full of meaning, fire and music.

941
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:54,140
You've talked to that
venomous fishwife DeWitt.

942
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:56,940
In this case, as trustworthy
as the world almanac.

943
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:59,980
You knew when you came in
that Eve was your understudy.

944
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:02,460
Playing that childish game of cat and mouse.

945
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:05,620
Not mouse. Never mouse. If anything, rat.

946
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:10,340
Your genius for making a bar-room brawl
out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding.

947
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:13,060
Perfectly innocent?
Men have been hanged for less.

948
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:15,460
I'm lied to, attacked behind my back,

949
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:18,620
accused of reading your play
as if it were the holy gospel.

950
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:20,420
I never said it was.

951
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:24,660
You listen as if someone else had written
your play. Whom do you have in mind?

952
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:27,900
Arthur Miller? Sherwood?
Beaumont and Fletcher?

953
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:30,380
- May I say a word?
- No!

954
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:35,300
You think Miller or Sherwood would stand
for the nonsense I take from you?

955
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:39,500
Stick to Beaumont and Fletcher.
They've been dead for 300 years!

956
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:43,220
All playwrights should be dead for 300 years!

957
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:48,420
That would solve none of their problems
because actresses never die!

958
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:55,820
The stars never die and never change.

959
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:58,540
You may change this star any time you want

960
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:02,700
for a new and fresh and exciting one,
fully equipped with fire and music.

961
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:06,740
Any time you want,
starting with tonight's performance.

962
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:08,820
This is for lawyers to talk about.

963
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:12,540
This concerns a contract
that you cannot rewrite or ad-lib.

964
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:16,820
Are you threatening me
with legal action, Mr Fabian?

965
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:21,220
- Are you breaking the contract?
- Answer my question.

966
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:25,260
- Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.
- I don't hear you.

967
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:29,100
- I said I'm a dying man!
- Not until the last drugstore

968
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:31,780
has sold its last pill.

969
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:35,460
I shall never understand the process
by which a body with a voice

970
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:37,900
suddenly fancies itself as a mind.

971
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:40,380
Just when does an actress decide

972
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:43,900
they're her words she's saying
and her thoughts she's expressing?

973
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:47,460
Usually at the point
when she has to rewrite and rethink them

974
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:50,100
to keep the audience from leaving the theatre.

975
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:54,860
It's about time the piano realised
it has not written the concerto!

976
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:06,220
And you, I take it, are the Paderewski
who plays his concerto on me, the piano?

977
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:10,420
Where is Princess Fire and Music?

978
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,860
- Who?
- The kid. Junior.

979
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:21,140
- Gone.
- I must have frightened her away.

980
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:24,020
I wouldn't be surprised.
Sometimes you frighten me.

981
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:27,380
Poor little flower.
Dropped her petals and folded her tent.

982
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:30,660
- Don't mix your metaphors.
- I'll mix what I like!

983
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:33,780
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.

984
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:36,220
What a body. What a voice.

985
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:40,820
That ex ship-news reporter.
No body, no voice, all mind.

986
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:45,300
- The gong rang, the fight's over, calm down.
- I will not calm down.

987
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:47,780
Don't calm down.

988
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:54,580
- You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
- I'm trying terribly hard.

989
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:58,980
Well, you needn't be. I will not be
tolerated and I will not be plotted against.

990
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:02,180
- Here we go.
- Such nonsense. What do you take me for?

991
01:09:02,260 --> 01:09:06,620
Little Nell from the country? Been my
understudy for a week without me knowing it.

992
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:09,660
- Carefully hidden, no doubt.
- Don't get carried away.

993
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:13,140
Arrives here for an audition
when everyone knows I will be here,

994
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:17,860
- and gives a performance out of nowhere.
- You've been all through that with Lloyd.

995
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:21,900
The playwright doesn't make the
performance. It doesn't just happen.

996
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:24,780
Full of fire and music and whatnot.

997
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:27,180
Carefully rehearsed, I have no doubt.

998
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:29,900
Full of those Bill Sampson touches.

999
01:09:29,980 --> 01:09:33,340
- I am tired of these paranoiac outbursts.
- Paranoiac?

1000
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:36,420
I didn't know Eve was
your understudy until this afternoon.

1001
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:42,060
- Tell that to Dr Freud along with the rest of it.
- No, I'll tell it to you for the last time.

1002
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:46,460
Cos you've got to stop hurting the two of us
by these paranoiac tantrums.

1003
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:50,060
- That word. I don't even know what it means.
- It's time you found out.

1004
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:52,660
I love you. I love you.

1005
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:55,660
- You're beautiful and intelligent.
- A body with a voice.

1006
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:59,380
A beautiful and an intelligent woman,
and a great actress.

1007
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:04,380
A great actress at the peak of her career.
You have every reason for happiness.

1008
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:06,300
- Except happiness.
- Every reason.

1009
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:10,900
But due to some uncontrollable drive,
you permit the slightest action of a kid...

1010
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:14,740
- A kid!
- ..a kid to turn you into a screaming harpy.

1011
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:17,060
Now, once and for all, stop it.

1012
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:36,620
It's obvious you're not a woman.

1013
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:41,460
- I've been aware of that for some time.
- Well, I am.

1014
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:43,540
I'll say.

1015
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:46,020
Don't be condescending.

1016
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:48,500
Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.

1017
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:53,580
I may have seen better days, but I'm
still not to be had for the price of a cocktail.

1018
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:55,660
Like a salted peanut.

1019
01:10:56,740 --> 01:11:01,260
- Margo, let's make peace.
- The terms are too high.

1020
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:05,620
Just being happy? Just stopping
all this nonsense about Eve?

1021
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:08,260
- And Eve and me?
- It's not nonsense.

1022
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:12,420
But if I tell you it is, as I just did...
were you listening to me?

1023
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:17,620
- Isn't that enough?
- I wish it were.

1024
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:20,180
Then what would be enough?

1025
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:22,500
If we got married?

1026
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:25,700
I wouldn't want you to marry me
just to prove something.

1027
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:29,340
You've had so many reasons
for not wanting to marry me.

1028
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:33,740
Margo, tell me what's behind all this.

1029
01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:35,740
I don't know, Bill.

1030
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:38,140
It's just a feeling. I don't know.

1031
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:40,140
I think you do know.

1032
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:42,820
But you won't or can't tell me.

1033
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:48,580
I said before it was gonna be
my last try, and I meant it.

1034
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:52,060
I can't think of anything else to do.
I wish I could.

1035
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:56,500
We usually wind up screaming
as the curtain comes down.

1036
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:59,140
Then it comes up again and everything's fine.

1037
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:01,220
But not this time.

1038
01:12:03,140 --> 01:12:05,820
No playwright in the world
could make me believe

1039
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:09,100
this would happen between two adult people.

1040
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:12,420
Goodbye, Margo.

1041
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:20,420
Bill?

1042
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:24,380
Where are you going?

1043
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:26,660
To find Eve?

1044
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:31,660
That suddenly makes
the whole thing believable.

1045
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:55,060
Lloyd.

1046
01:12:55,980 --> 01:12:59,660
- Lloyd, what's happened?
- Up to here, that's where I've got it.

1047
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:02,420
Of all the star-ridden,
presumptuous, hysterical...

1048
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:04,300
- Margo again.
- And again and again.

1049
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:07,460
- Two hours late for the audition.
- That's on time for Margo.

1050
01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:11,300
And then a childish routine about
not knowing Eve was her understudy.

1051
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:13,620
- It's possible she didn't.
- She knew.

1052
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:17,580
Addison told her how superbly
Eve had read the part.

1053
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:21,740
Karen, let me tell you about Eve.
She's got everything. A born actress.

1054
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:26,260
- Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting...
- You'll run out of adjectives, dear.

1055
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:29,580
Everything a playwright first thinks
of wanting to write about,

1056
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:32,540
until his play becomes
a vehicle for Miss Channing.

1057
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:34,540
Margo hasn't done badly by it.

1058
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:37,380
Margo's great.
She knows it, that's the trouble.

1059
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:40,580
She can play Peck's Bad Boy
all she wants and who's to stop her?

1060
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:44,660
Who's to give her that boot
in the rear she needs and deserves?

1061
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:48,700
It's gonna be a cosy weekend.

1062
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:51,740
- What is?
- We're driving to the country tomorrow.

1063
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:55,020
Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I.

1064
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:58,780
Well, we've spent weekends
before with nobody talking.

1065
01:13:58,860 --> 01:14:03,300
Just be sure to lock up
all blunt instruments and throwable objects.

1066
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:11,100
Newton, they say, thought of gravity
by getting hit on the head by an apple.

1067
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:15,500
And the man who invented the steam-engine,
he was watching a teakettle.

1068
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:20,060
But not me. My big idea came
to me just sitting on a couch.

1069
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:24,900
That boot in the rear to Margo.
Heaven knows, she had one coming.

1070
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:29,100
From me, from Lloyd, from Eve,
Bill, Max and so on.

1071
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:32,500
We'd allfelt those size fives
of hers often enough.

1072
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:36,020
But how? The answer was
buzzing around me like a fly.

1073
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:38,900
I had it.

1074
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:43,020
But I let it go.
Screaming and calling names is one thing,

1075
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:45,100
but this could mean...

1076
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:51,020
Why not? "Why"I said to myself"not?"

1077
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:56,060
It would all seem perfectly legitimate.
And only two people in the world would know.

1078
01:14:56,140 --> 01:15:00,060
Also, the boot would land where
it would do the most goodfor all concerned.

1079
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:02,940
After all, it was no more than a harmless joke

1080
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:05,980
which Margo herself
would be the first to enjoy.

1081
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:10,060
And no reason why she shouldn't
be told about it... in time.

1082
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:22,060
Hello. Will you please call
Miss Eve Harrington to the phone?

1083
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:25,420
Not at all. I'll wait.

1084
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:30,940
It was a cold weekend, outside and in.

1085
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:32,820
Bill didn't come at all.

1086
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:37,500
Margo didn't know where he was
and didn't care... she kept saying.

1087
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:40,020
Somehow we staggered through Sunday,

1088
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:43,780
and by the time we drove Margo
to the station late Monday afternoon,

1089
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:48,740
she and Lloyd had thawed out
to the extent of being civil to each other.

1090
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:52,820
- What time is it?
- When you asked a minute ago, it was 5.42.

1091
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:55,940
It is now 5.43.
When you ask again a minute from now...

1092
01:15:56,020 --> 01:16:00,220
I just don't want Margo to miss her train.
As it is, she'll barely make the theatre.

1093
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:03,940
5.55. We'll be at the station in plenty of time.

1094
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:07,580
That little place
" just two hours from New York".

1095
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:12,780
It's on my list of things I'll never understand,
like collecting shrunken Indian heads.

1096
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:16,180
You should know what it means
to want a little peace and quiet.

1097
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:18,860
Peace and quiet is for libraries.

1098
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:21,020
Lloyd. Please.

1099
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:24,700
Just a little skid, that's all.
This road's like glass.

1100
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:28,740
- Karen and I just don't want an accident.
- I don't intend to have an accident.

1101
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:32,940
It isn't important whether you do.
We are wearing long underwear.

1102
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:37,020
Now what's this?

1103
01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:54,180
But it can't be. We can't be out of gas.

1104
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:58,780
I filled it myself yesterday. Wasn't it full
when you drove to Brewster this morning?

1105
01:16:58,860 --> 01:17:02,220
I didn't look. You know
I don't pay attention to those things.

1106
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:03,780
Just incredible.

1107
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:06,860
- How much time have we got?
- Roughly ten minutes.

1108
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:09,780
- Howfar is the station?
- About three or four miles.

1109
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:14,020
- Any houses where we can borrow gas?
- There's not much along this back road.

1110
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:17,260
Not many cars either.
Not much chance of a lift.

1111
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:21,340
No sense in sitting here. I'm gonna
walk up about half a mile, just in case.

1112
01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:41,260
- You want it on?
- It doesn't matter.

1113
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:43,980
I detest cheap sentiment.

1114
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:52,460
Karen?

1115
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:53,660
No, thank you.

1116
01:17:53,740 --> 01:17:58,220
- I haven't been very pleasant this weekend.
- We've all been a little tense lately.

1117
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:03,140
Come to think of it, I haven't been very
pleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry.

1118
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:07,020
More than any two people I know, I don't
want you and Lloyd to be angry with me.

1119
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:10,940
We're never deeply angry.
We just get mad the way you do.

1120
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:13,020
We know you too well.

1121
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:15,580
So many people know me.

1122
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:18,660
I wish I did.
I wish someone would tell me about me.

1123
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:21,580
You're Margo. Just... Margo.

1124
01:18:22,180 --> 01:18:26,860
And what is that? Besides something
spelled out in light bulbs, I mean.

1125
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:32,460
Besides a temperament, which consists
mostly of swooping about on a broomstick

1126
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:34,780
and screaming at the top of my voice.

1127
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:37,260
Infants behave the way I do, you know.

1128
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:41,540
They carry on and misbehave.
They'd get drunk if they knew how,

1129
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:44,340
when they can't have what they want.

1130
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:47,540
When they feel unwanted or insecure or...

1131
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:50,220
unloved.

1132
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:55,020
- What about Bill?
- What about Bill?

1133
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:56,700
He's in love with you.

1134
01:18:56,780 --> 01:19:01,380
More than anything in this world,
I love Bill. And I want Bill.

1135
01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:03,460
And I want him to want me.

1136
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:05,540
But me, not Margo Channing.

1137
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:09,340
And if I can't tell them apart, how can he?

1138
01:19:10,060 --> 01:19:12,460
Well, why should he and why should you?

1139
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:17,260
Bill's in love with Margo Channing. He's
fought with her, worked with her, loved her.

1140
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:21,460
But ten years from now
Margo Channing will have ceased to exist.

1141
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:25,020
And what's left will be... what?

1142
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:29,220
Margo, Bill is all of
eight years younger than you.

1143
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:34,140
Those years stretch as the years go on.
I've seen it happen too often.

1144
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:36,380
Not to you, not to Bill.

1145
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:39,140
Isn't that what they always say?

1146
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:46,540
I don't suppose the heater runs
if the motor doesn't.

1147
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:51,980
Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so
people could just sit in a car and keep warm.

1148
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:54,980
About Eve.

1149
01:19:55,060 --> 01:19:58,300
I've acted pretty disgracefully
toward her too.

1150
01:19:59,260 --> 01:20:02,060
- Well...
- Don't fumble for excuses.

1151
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:04,780
Not here and now with my hair down.

1152
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:09,380
At best, let's say I've been oversensitive to...

1153
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:14,220
Well, to the fact that she's so young,
so feminine and so helpless.

1154
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:17,380
To so many things I want to be for Bill.

1155
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:24,660
It's funny, a woman's career. The things you
drop on your way up so you can move faster.

1156
01:20:24,740 --> 01:20:28,540
You forget you'll need them again
when you get back to being a woman.

1157
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:33,300
That's one career all females have
in common, whether we like it or not.

1158
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:35,380
Being a woman.

1159
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:37,980
Sooner or later, we've got to work at it.

1160
01:20:38,660 --> 01:20:42,220
No matter how many
other careers we've had or wanted.

1161
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:47,140
And in the last analysis,
nothing's any good unless you can

1162
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:49,740
look up just before dinner or

1163
01:20:49,820 --> 01:20:52,340
turn around in bed and there he is.

1164
01:20:52,420 --> 01:20:54,620
Without that, you're not a woman.

1165
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:59,940
You're something with a French provincial
office or a... a book full of clippings.

1166
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:03,620
But you're not a woman.

1167
01:21:07,180 --> 01:21:09,380
Slow curtain. The end.

1168
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:16,420
Margo. Margo, I want you
to know how sorry I am about this.

1169
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:19,260
- About what?
- This.

1170
01:21:19,340 --> 01:21:21,900
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

1171
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:24,860
Don't give it a thought.
One of destiny's merry pranks.

1172
01:21:24,940 --> 01:21:29,380
After all, you didn't personally
drain the gasoline tank yourself.

1173
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:38,180
Eve, of course, was superb.

1174
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:43,140
Many of the audience understandably
preferred to return another time to see Margo.

1175
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:47,580
But those who remained cheered loudly,
lustily and longfor Eve.

1176
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:51,180
How thoughtful of her to call
and invite me that afternoon.

1177
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:54,500
And what a happy coincidence
that several representatives

1178
01:21:54,580 --> 01:21:56,980
of other newspapers happened to be present.

1179
01:21:57,060 --> 01:21:59,260
All of us invited that afternoon

1180
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:03,820
to attend an understudy's performance,
about which the management knew nothing

1181
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:07,340
until they were forced
to ring up the curtain at nine o'clock.

1182
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:08,780
Coincidence.

1183
01:22:08,860 --> 01:22:11,100
You were better than all right.

1184
01:22:11,180 --> 01:22:14,620
You rang a bell. Little things
here and there, but it doesn't matter.

1185
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:17,140
Be proud of yourself. You've got a right to be.

1186
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:19,220
Are you proud of me, Bill?

1187
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:22,220
I admit I was worried
when Max called. I had my doubts.

1188
01:22:22,460 --> 01:22:26,580
- You shouldn't have had any doubts.
- After all, the other day was one scene.

1189
01:22:26,660 --> 01:22:29,140
The woods are full of one-scene sensations.

1190
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:32,940
But you did it. With work and patience,
you'll be a good actress

1191
01:22:33,020 --> 01:22:36,180
- if that's what you wanna be.
- Is that what you want me to be?

1192
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:40,180
- I'm talking about you and what you want.
- So am I.

1193
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:45,260
- What have I got to do with it?
- Everything.

1194
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:52,220
The names I've been called,
but never Svengali. Good luck.

1195
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:57,460
Don't run away, Bill.

1196
01:22:57,540 --> 01:22:59,940
From what would I be running?

1197
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:05,420
You're always after truth
on the stage. What about off?

1198
01:23:06,140 --> 01:23:09,340
- I'm for it.
- Then face it. I have.

1199
01:23:09,660 --> 01:23:14,860
- Ever since that first night in here.
- I told you what every actress should know.

1200
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:18,780
You told me that whatever I became,
it would be because of you.

1201
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:21,740
- Make-up's a little heavy.
- And for you.

1202
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:25,540
- You're quite a girl.
- You think?

1203
01:23:25,620 --> 01:23:30,420
- I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
- You hear all kinds of things.

1204
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:34,260
I'm only human, rumours to the contrary,
and I'm as curious as the next man.

1205
01:23:34,340 --> 01:23:37,140
- Find out.
- Only thing:

1206
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:39,380
what I go after I want to go after.

1207
01:23:39,460 --> 01:23:41,460
I don't want it to come after me.

1208
01:23:48,140 --> 01:23:51,780
Don't cry. Just score it
as an incomplete forward pass.

1209
01:24:12,980 --> 01:24:14,940
Who is it?

1210
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:18,580
May I come in?

1211
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:21,580
Certainly, Mr DeWitt.

1212
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:28,460
I expected to find this room
with a theatreful of people at your feet.

1213
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:32,860
- I'm lucky they didn't throw things.
- Your performance was no surprise to me.

1214
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:36,260
After the other day, I regarded it
as simply a promise fulfilled.

1215
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:40,220
You're more than kind. But it's
still Miss Channing's performance.

1216
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:43,460
I'm the carbon copy you read
when you can't find the original.

1217
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:48,580
- You're more than modest.
- It's not modesty. I don't try to kid myself.

1218
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:50,940
A revolutionary approach to the theatre.

1219
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:55,300
- But if I may make a suggestion...
- Please do.

1220
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:58,300
I think the time has come
to shed some of your humility.

1221
01:24:58,380 --> 01:25:02,420
It is just as false not to blow your horn
at all as it is to blow it too loudly.

1222
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:05,420
I don't think I've done anything
to sound off about.

1223
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:09,420
We come into this world with our little
egos equipped with individual horns.

1224
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:11,500
If we don't blow them, who else will?

1225
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:17,740
Even so... one pretty good performance by
an understudy, it'll be forgotten tomorrow.

1226
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:21,780
It needn't be.

1227
01:25:21,860 --> 01:25:27,260
Even if I wanted to, as you say,
be less humble, blow my own horn,

1228
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:31,300
how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.

1229
01:25:32,380 --> 01:25:35,660
- I'm somebody.
- You certainly are.

1230
01:25:37,060 --> 01:25:40,500
Leave the door open a bit... so we can talk.

1231
01:25:44,980 --> 01:25:49,380
After you change, if you're not busy
elsewhere, we could have supper.

1232
01:25:49,660 --> 01:25:52,660
I'd love to. Or should I pretend I'm busy?

1233
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:57,060
Let's have a minimum of pretending.
I shall want to do a column about you.

1234
01:25:57,140 --> 01:25:59,380
I'm not even enough for a paragraph.

1235
01:25:59,460 --> 01:26:04,100
Perhaps more than one. There's so much
I want to know. I've heard your story in part.

1236
01:26:04,180 --> 01:26:08,820
Your home in Wisconsin, your tragic
marriage, your fanatical attachment to Margo.

1237
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:11,820
It started in San Francisco, didn't it?

1238
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:16,940
I say your idolatry of Margo
started in San Francisco, didn't it?

1239
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:18,180
That's right.

1240
01:26:18,260 --> 01:26:22,020
San Francisco, an oasis of
civilisation in the California desert.

1241
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:26,220
Tell me, do you share
my high opinion of San Francisco?

1242
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:28,300
Yes, I do.

1243
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:33,100
And that memorable night when Margo
first dazzled you from the stage,

1244
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:37,180
what theatre was it in San Francisco?
Was it the Shubert?

1245
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:39,260
Yes, the Shubert.

1246
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:43,380
Fine old theatre, the Shubert. Full of tradition.

1247
01:26:43,460 --> 01:26:47,060
Untouched by the earthquake.
Or should I say fire?

1248
01:26:47,180 --> 01:26:49,820
Tell me, what was your husband's name?

1249
01:26:50,780 --> 01:26:52,780
- Eddie.
- Eddie what?

1250
01:26:56,540 --> 01:27:00,220
I'm about to go into the shower.
I won't be able to hear you.

1251
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:02,100
Well, it can wait.

1252
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:05,300
Where would you like to go?
We must make this a special night.

1253
01:27:05,380 --> 01:27:08,500
You take charge.

1254
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:10,380
I believe I will.

1255
01:27:24,020 --> 01:27:27,740
Some morning papers carried
a squib about Eve's performance.

1256
01:27:27,820 --> 01:27:30,180
Not much, but full of praise.

1257
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:32,740
I couldn't imagine
how they found out about it.

1258
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:36,820
But Lloyd said Max's publicity man
probably sent out the story.

1259
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:40,100
At any rate, lfelt terribly guilty
and ashamed of myself

1260
01:27:40,180 --> 01:27:43,420
and wanted nothing so much
as to forget the whole thing.

1261
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:45,740
Margo and I were having lunch at 21,

1262
01:27:45,820 --> 01:27:48,340
just like girlfriends... with hats on.

1263
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:52,580
- Has Miss Channing come in?
- Not yet.

1264
01:27:52,660 --> 01:27:54,660
Thank you.

1265
01:27:55,620 --> 01:27:59,820
Eve! I've heard the most wonderful
things about your performance.

1266
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:03,260
- Relief that I managed to stagger through it.
- She was magnificent.

1267
01:28:03,340 --> 01:28:05,500
- Then you've heard, too.
- I was there.

1268
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:08,460
- You were at the play last night?
- A happy coincidence.

1269
01:28:08,540 --> 01:28:12,620
- We're having lunch with a talent scout.
- They certainly don't waste much time.

1270
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:16,340
- It's nothing definite. Just lunch.
- They'll be wasting their time.

1271
01:28:16,420 --> 01:28:19,340
Eve has no intention of going to Hollywood.

1272
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:22,540
By your smart dress,
I take it your companion is a lady?

1273
01:28:22,620 --> 01:28:24,820
- Margo.
- Margo lunching in public?

1274
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:27,620
It's a new Margo,
but she's just as late as the old one.

1275
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:30,100
She may be later than you think.

1276
01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:36,100
Why not read my column to pass the time?

1277
01:28:36,180 --> 01:28:38,900
- The minutes will fly like hours.
- Thank you, Addison.

1278
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:41,500
Now we must join our sunburnt eager beaver.

1279
01:28:41,580 --> 01:28:43,580
- Goodbye, Karen.
- Goodbye.

1280
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:08,180
"And so my hat which has,
lo, these many seasons,

1281
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:11,900
become firmly rooted about my ears,
is lifted to Miss Harrington."

1282
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:15,820
"I am available for dancing in the streets
and shouting from the housetops."

1283
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:19,540
I thought that one went out with Woollcott.
Now listen to this.

1284
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:23,780
"Miss Harrington had much to tell and
these columns shall report her faithfully

1285
01:29:23,860 --> 01:29:27,620
about the lamentable practice
in our theatre of permitting

1286
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:30,500
mature actresses to continue playing roles

1287
01:29:30,580 --> 01:29:34,820
requiring a youth and vigour
of which they retain but a dim memory."

1288
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:37,900
- I just can't believe it.
- It gets better.

1289
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:42,340
"About the understandable reluctance
of our entrenched first ladies of the stage

1290
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:45,140
to encourage, shall we say,
younger actresses,

1291
01:29:45,220 --> 01:29:48,620
and Miss Harrington's unsupported
struggle for opportunity."

1292
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:51,700
- I can't believe Eve said those things.
- In this rat race,

1293
01:29:51,780 --> 01:29:54,380
everybody's guilty till proved innocent.

1294
01:29:54,460 --> 01:29:58,940
One of the differences between
the theatre and civilisation.

1295
01:29:59,020 --> 01:30:03,820
What gets me is how all the papers happened
to catch that particular performance.

1296
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:05,900
Lloyd says it's a publicity release.

1297
01:30:05,980 --> 01:30:08,660
The witch must have sent out Indian Runners,

1298
01:30:08,740 --> 01:30:13,740
snatching critics out of bars, steam rooms
and museums or wherever they hole up.

1299
01:30:13,820 --> 01:30:17,460
She won't get away with it.
Nor will Addison DeWitt and his poison pen.

1300
01:30:17,540 --> 01:30:21,020
If Equity or my lawyer can't
or won't do anything about it,

1301
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:27,260
I shall personally stuff that pathetic little
lost lamb down Mr DeWitt's ugly throat!

1302
01:30:36,420 --> 01:30:40,860
I came as soon as I read that piece of filth.
I ran all the way.

1303
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:54,060
Bill's here, baby.

1304
01:30:54,140 --> 01:30:56,140
Everything's all right now.

1305
01:31:03,940 --> 01:31:07,420
I guess at this point
I'm what the French call "de trop".

1306
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:10,100
Maybe just a little around the edges.

1307
01:31:22,340 --> 01:31:26,100
It's Addison from start to finish.
It drips with his brand of venom.

1308
01:31:26,180 --> 01:31:28,700
Taking advantage of a kid,
twisting her words,

1309
01:31:28,780 --> 01:31:31,460
making her say what he wanted her to say.

1310
01:31:31,540 --> 01:31:34,900
- Where did you get all that information?
- Eve.

1311
01:31:34,980 --> 01:31:37,860
- Eve?
- She's been to see me.

1312
01:31:37,940 --> 01:31:41,100
She left just before you came in.
You just missed her.

1313
01:31:41,180 --> 01:31:44,540
- That was a pity.
- Wanted to explain about the interview.

1314
01:31:44,620 --> 01:31:48,260
Wanted to apologise to someone,
and didn't dare face Margo.

1315
01:31:48,340 --> 01:31:52,100
- I wonder why.
- She started talking and couldn't finish.

1316
01:31:52,180 --> 01:31:54,180
She cried so.

1317
01:31:55,660 --> 01:31:59,620
I've been going over our financial position,
if you'll pardon the expression.

1318
01:31:59,700 --> 01:32:04,020
- That's quite a change of subject.
- What with taxes coming up, and,

1319
01:32:04,100 --> 01:32:07,820
since I'm a playwright and not
an oil-well operator, I was thinking...

1320
01:32:07,860 --> 01:32:10,060
I'm trying hard to follow you.

1321
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:13,700
Instead of waiting until next season
to do Footsteps on the Ceiling,

1322
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:15,580
which is in pretty good shape,

1323
01:32:15,660 --> 01:32:19,420
and if Margo can be talked into
going on tour with Aged in Wood,

1324
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:22,500
we could put Footsteps
into production right away.

1325
01:32:22,580 --> 01:32:26,220
- I'm beginning to catch up.
- If we can cast it properly, that is.

1326
01:32:26,300 --> 01:32:30,940
Maybe get some younger actress? Someone
who'd look the part as well as play it?

1327
01:32:31,020 --> 01:32:35,460
- You've got to admit, it'd be a novelty.
- Now you're quoting Addison... or Eve.

1328
01:32:35,540 --> 01:32:37,860
Eve did mention the play, but in passing.

1329
01:32:37,940 --> 01:32:40,820
She'd never have the nerve
to ask to play a part like Cora.

1330
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:43,900
Eve would askAbbott to give her Costello.

1331
01:32:43,980 --> 01:32:47,140
I got the idea myself while
she was talking about the play.

1332
01:32:47,220 --> 01:32:49,940
- With gestures, of course.
- To write something

1333
01:32:50,020 --> 01:32:54,620
and have it realised completely.
For once, not to compromise.

1334
01:32:55,260 --> 01:32:59,660
Lloyd Richards, do not consider giving
that contemptible little worm the part of Cora!

1335
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:04,500
- Now just a minute...
- Margo's not been exactly a compromise.

1336
01:33:04,580 --> 01:33:08,140
Playwrights everywhere would
give their shirts for that compromise.

1337
01:33:08,220 --> 01:33:09,300
Now just a minute...

1338
01:33:09,380 --> 01:33:12,700
Eve's disloyalty and ingratitude
must be contagious.

1339
01:33:12,780 --> 01:33:16,260
All this hysteria because
of an impulsive excited kid

1340
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:19,140
and a professional
manure-slinger named DeWitt.

1341
01:33:19,220 --> 01:33:22,940
- She apologised, didn't she?
- On her knees, I've no doubt.

1342
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:26,020
Very touching.
Very Academy of Dramatic Arts.

1343
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:29,980
That bitter cynicism is something
you've acquired since you left Radcliffe.

1344
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:35,180
That cynicism I acquired the day I
discovered I was different from little boys.

1345
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:38,140
Hello.

1346
01:33:38,580 --> 01:33:40,820
Hi, Margo.

1347
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:43,100
No, not at all.

1348
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:47,180
Karen and I were just chatting.

1349
01:33:50,180 --> 01:33:53,420
Yes, I'm sure we can
and I'm sure we'd love to.

1350
01:33:53,940 --> 01:33:56,500
Right. 11.45ish.

1351
01:33:58,340 --> 01:34:00,340
See you then.

1352
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:06,580
Margo and Bill want us to meet them
at the Cub Room tonight after the theatre.

1353
01:34:06,660 --> 01:34:09,180
Margo Channing in the Cub Room.

1354
01:34:09,260 --> 01:34:12,580
I couldn't be more surprised
if she'd said Grant's tomb.

1355
01:34:12,660 --> 01:34:16,660
- I'm glad Bill's back.
- They'd die without each other.

1356
01:34:17,660 --> 01:34:21,020
I didn't promise Eve anything.
I said she'd be fine for the part

1357
01:34:21,100 --> 01:34:23,300
but there were practical difficulties.

1358
01:34:23,380 --> 01:34:25,380
- Such as?
- You, for one.

1359
01:34:25,460 --> 01:34:29,460
I told her you wanted Margo to play
the part and I would want your approval.

1360
01:34:29,540 --> 01:34:31,620
That's fine. Fine and dandy.

1361
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:35,700
Just refer all of Miss Eve Harrington's
future requests to me.

1362
01:34:39,580 --> 01:34:43,940
The so-called art of acting is not one
for which I have a particularly high regard.

1363
01:34:44,020 --> 01:34:46,780
- Hear, hear.
- But you may quote me as follows:

1364
01:34:46,860 --> 01:34:51,820
"Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave
a performance in your cockamamie play,

1365
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:57,780
the like of which I have never seen before
and expect rarely to see again."

1366
01:34:57,860 --> 01:35:01,300
- He does not exaggerate. I was good.
- You were great.

1367
01:35:01,380 --> 01:35:06,460
Quite a night. I hear your understudy,
a Miss Harrington, has given her notice.

1368
01:35:06,540 --> 01:35:08,580
- Too bad.
- I'm broken up about it.

1369
01:35:08,660 --> 01:35:11,420
You just can't pick up
champagne and drink it.

1370
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:13,900
Somebody's got to be
very witty about a toast.

1371
01:35:13,980 --> 01:35:15,980
I shall propose the toast,

1372
01:35:16,060 --> 01:35:19,060
without wit, with all my heart.

1373
01:35:20,020 --> 01:35:21,700
To Margo.

1374
01:35:21,780 --> 01:35:24,780
- To my bride-to-be.
- Glory hallelujah.

1375
01:35:24,980 --> 01:35:26,980
- Margo.
- Drink.

1376
01:35:29,860 --> 01:35:33,740
- When? When are you going to do it?
- Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at ten.

1377
01:35:33,820 --> 01:35:36,420
- And you're going to be on time.
- Yes, sir.

1378
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:41,660
City Hall, that's for prizefighters and
reporters. I see a cathedral, banks of flowers...

1379
01:35:41,740 --> 01:35:45,460
It's only for the licence.
There's a three-day wait for blood tests.

1380
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:48,620
I'll marry you if it turns out
you have no blood at all.

1381
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:51,700
- What are you going to wear?
- Something simple,

1382
01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:53,740
a fur coat over a nightgown.

1383
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:58,620
The point is this. In a cathedral,
a ballpark or a penny arcade,

1384
01:35:58,700 --> 01:36:02,460
we want you two beside us,
as our nearest and dearest friends.

1385
01:36:02,540 --> 01:36:05,740
Which we are. Which we'll always be.

1386
01:36:05,820 --> 01:36:10,380
There are very few moments in life
as good as this. Let's remember it.

1387
01:36:10,460 --> 01:36:14,180
To each of us and all of us -
never have we been more close.

1388
01:36:14,260 --> 01:36:16,660
May we never be farther apart.

1389
01:36:18,980 --> 01:36:20,820
- Mrs Richards?
- Yes.

1390
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:22,900
- For you.
- Thank you.

1391
01:36:24,060 --> 01:36:26,980
Very indiscreet. A note in the open like that.

1392
01:36:27,060 --> 01:36:30,180
Next time, tell your lover
to blow smoke rings or tap a glass.

1393
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:32,500
Lloyd, I want you to be big about this.

1394
01:36:32,580 --> 01:36:36,060
The world is full of love tonight.
No woman is safe.

1395
01:36:36,140 --> 01:36:41,540
Well, this beats all world's records
for running, jumping or standing gall.

1396
01:36:43,140 --> 01:36:46,260
"Forgive my butting in to what
seems such a happy occasion,

1397
01:36:46,340 --> 01:36:48,540
but it's important that I speak with you."

1398
01:36:48,620 --> 01:36:50,980
"Please", and that's underlined,

1399
01:36:51,060 --> 01:36:53,980
"meet me in the ladies' room. Eve."

1400
01:36:54,740 --> 01:36:57,980
I understand she's now
the understudy in there.

1401
01:36:58,060 --> 01:37:00,660
Hand me that empty bottle. I may find her.

1402
01:37:02,820 --> 01:37:05,540
Well, look. There's Rasputin.

1403
01:37:12,580 --> 01:37:16,100
- More champagne, Miss Channing?
- That's what I said, bub.

1404
01:37:16,180 --> 01:37:21,060
- Maybe she just wants to apologise.
- I have no interest in anything she may say.

1405
01:37:21,140 --> 01:37:24,460
But what could she say?
That's what fascinates me.

1406
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:28,700
- Go on, find out.
- Karen, in all the years of our friendship,

1407
01:37:28,780 --> 01:37:32,220
I have never let you go
to the ladies' room alone.

1408
01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:35,020
Now I must. I am busting to find out

1409
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:39,420
what's going on in that feverish
little brain waiting in there.

1410
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:43,980
Well... all right.

1411
01:37:48,860 --> 01:37:50,780
Karen!

1412
01:37:50,860 --> 01:37:52,860
How nice.

1413
01:38:03,860 --> 01:38:06,660
Very effective, but why take it out on me?

1414
01:38:30,700 --> 01:38:32,820
I was wondering whether you'd come at all.

1415
01:38:32,900 --> 01:38:35,740
Don't get up. And don't act
as if I were the Queen Mother.

1416
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:37,820
I don't expect you to be pleasant.

1417
01:38:37,900 --> 01:38:39,980
I don't intend to be.

1418
01:38:40,060 --> 01:38:43,900
Can't we sit down just for a minute?
I've got a lot to say and none of it's easy.

1419
01:38:43,980 --> 01:38:46,340
- There can't be very much.
- But there is.

1420
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:50,180
- Easy or not, I won't believe a word of it.
- Why should you?

1421
01:38:51,060 --> 01:38:53,060
Please sit down.

1422
01:38:58,420 --> 01:39:02,020
You know, I've always considered
myself a very clever girl.

1423
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:05,220
Smart, good head on my shoulders,
that sort of thing.

1424
01:39:05,300 --> 01:39:08,660
Never the wrong word at the wrong time.

1425
01:39:08,740 --> 01:39:11,140
But then I'd never metAddison DeWitt.

1426
01:39:13,380 --> 01:39:15,460
I remember I had a tooth pulled once.

1427
01:39:15,540 --> 01:39:18,660
They gave me some anaesthetic.
I don't remember the name.

1428
01:39:18,740 --> 01:39:20,540
It affected me strangely.

1429
01:39:20,620 --> 01:39:24,180
I found myself saying things
I wasn't even thinking.

1430
01:39:24,260 --> 01:39:28,180
As if my mind was outside of my body
and couldn't control what I did or said.

1431
01:39:28,260 --> 01:39:31,540
- And you felt like that talking to Addison?
- In a way.

1432
01:39:31,620 --> 01:39:36,020
You find yourself trying to say what
you mean, but somehow the words change.

1433
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:38,100
They become his words.

1434
01:39:38,180 --> 01:39:42,300
And suddenly you're not saying
what you mean, but what he means.

1435
01:39:42,380 --> 01:39:46,620
Do you expect me to believe that you didn't
say any of that? That they were all Addison?

1436
01:39:46,700 --> 01:39:48,980
I don't expect you to believe anything,

1437
01:39:49,060 --> 01:39:52,980
except that the responsibility
is mine... and the disgrace.

1438
01:39:54,340 --> 01:39:56,740
Let's not get overdramatic.

1439
01:39:58,300 --> 01:40:01,300
You really have a low opinion
of me, haven't you?

1440
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:04,380
I'll give you some pleasant news.

1441
01:40:04,460 --> 01:40:08,620
I've been told off
in no uncertain terms, all over town.

1442
01:40:08,700 --> 01:40:11,060
Miss Channing should be happy to hear that.

1443
01:40:11,180 --> 01:40:13,940
To know how loyal her friends are,

1444
01:40:14,020 --> 01:40:18,060
how much more loyal than
she had a right to expect me to be.

1445
01:40:18,140 --> 01:40:20,940
- Eve, don't cry.
- I'm not crying.

1446
01:40:22,700 --> 01:40:26,660
Tell me, how did your luncheon
turn out with the man from Hollywood?

1447
01:40:26,740 --> 01:40:31,740
Some vague promises of a test. If a particular
part should come along, one of those things.

1448
01:40:31,820 --> 01:40:36,020
- But the raves about your performance...
- An understudy's performance.

1449
01:40:36,100 --> 01:40:40,740
Well, I think you're painting
the picture a little blacker than it is, really.

1450
01:40:40,820 --> 01:40:44,900
Don't underestimate him.
You have a powerful friend in Addison.

1451
01:40:45,220 --> 01:40:47,660
He's not my friend. You were my friends.

1452
01:40:47,740 --> 01:40:50,540
- He can help you.
- I wish I'd never met him.

1453
01:40:50,620 --> 01:40:52,620
I'd like him to be dead.

1454
01:40:52,700 --> 01:40:54,700
I want my friends back.

1455
01:40:55,580 --> 01:41:00,140
Eve... I don't think
you meant to cause unhappiness.

1456
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:04,340
But you did. More to yourself perhaps,
as it turned out, than to anyone else.

1457
01:41:04,420 --> 01:41:07,420
- I'll never get over it.
- Yes, you will.

1458
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:11,940
You theatre people always do.
Nothing is for ever in the theatre.

1459
01:41:12,020 --> 01:41:16,140
Whatever it is, it's here, it flares up, burns hot,

1460
01:41:16,220 --> 01:41:18,220
and it's gone.

1461
01:41:18,740 --> 01:41:22,380
- I wish I could believe that.
- Give yourself time.

1462
01:41:22,460 --> 01:41:24,940
Don't worry too much
about what people think.

1463
01:41:25,020 --> 01:41:27,620
You're very young and very talented.

1464
01:41:28,740 --> 01:41:32,940
And, believe it or not,
if there's anything I can do...

1465
01:41:33,020 --> 01:41:35,380
There is something.

1466
01:41:37,660 --> 01:41:42,060
- I think I know.
- Something most important you can do.

1467
01:41:42,420 --> 01:41:46,500
You wanna play Cora. You want me
to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.

1468
01:41:46,740 --> 01:41:49,660
If you told him so, he'd give me
the part. He said he would.

1469
01:41:49,740 --> 01:41:54,380
After all you've said. Don't you know
that part was written for Margo?

1470
01:41:54,460 --> 01:41:57,140
It might've been 15 years ago.
It's my part now.

1471
01:41:57,220 --> 01:42:02,420
- You talk just as Addison said you did.
- Cora is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd.

1472
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:06,740
- Nothing in the world will make me say that.
- Addison wants me to play it.

1473
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:09,820
- Over my dead body.
- That won't be necessary.

1474
01:42:10,180 --> 01:42:13,700
Addison knows how Margo
happened to miss that performance,

1475
01:42:13,780 --> 01:42:18,820
how I happened to know she'd miss it
in time to notify every paper in town.

1476
01:42:18,900 --> 01:42:22,180
It's quite a story.
Addison could make quite a thing of it.

1477
01:42:22,260 --> 01:42:26,380
Imagine how snide and vicious he could get,
and still tell nothing but the truth.

1478
01:42:26,580 --> 01:42:29,140
I had a time persuading him.

1479
01:42:30,340 --> 01:42:33,340
You better sit down. You look a bit wobbly.

1480
01:42:37,620 --> 01:42:42,100
If I play Cora, Addison will never
tell what happened, in or out of print.

1481
01:42:42,180 --> 01:42:45,140
A simple exchange of favours.

1482
01:42:45,220 --> 01:42:48,540
I'm so happy I can do something
for you at long last.

1483
01:42:50,620 --> 01:42:52,740
Your friendship with Margo,

1484
01:42:52,820 --> 01:42:55,300
your deep, close friendship.

1485
01:42:55,700 --> 01:43:01,020
What would happen to it if she knew the
cheap trick you played on her for my benefit?

1486
01:43:01,100 --> 01:43:04,740
You and Lloyd, how long, even in the theatre,

1487
01:43:05,860 --> 01:43:09,860
before people forgot what happened
and trusted you again?

1488
01:43:11,780 --> 01:43:13,420
No.

1489
01:43:14,580 --> 01:43:18,740
It would be so much easier for everyone
concerned if I were to play Cora.

1490
01:43:18,820 --> 01:43:21,220
So much better theatre, too.

1491
01:43:22,020 --> 01:43:24,020
A part in a play.

1492
01:43:25,180 --> 01:43:28,380
You'd do all that just for a part in a play?

1493
01:43:28,460 --> 01:43:31,260
I'd do much more for a part that good.

1494
01:43:53,620 --> 01:43:55,620
Hungry?

1495
01:43:57,340 --> 01:44:00,900
I'm not surprised, after all that humble pie.

1496
01:44:00,980 --> 01:44:04,620
Nothing of the kind.
Karen and I had a nice talk.

1497
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:06,700
Heart to heart? Woman to woman?

1498
01:44:06,780 --> 01:44:11,300
Including a casual reference to the part
of Cora and your hopes of playing it?

1499
01:44:11,380 --> 01:44:15,980
I discussed it very openly. I told her I'd
spoken to Lloyd, and that he was interested.

1500
01:44:16,060 --> 01:44:20,180
And Karen mentioned, of course,
that Margo expects to play the part?

1501
01:44:20,260 --> 01:44:23,940
Oddly enough, she didn't
say a word about Margo.

1502
01:44:24,020 --> 01:44:28,380
Just that she'll be happy to do
what she can to see that I play it.

1503
01:44:29,620 --> 01:44:32,020
Just like that?

1504
01:44:32,100 --> 01:44:34,540
Just like that.

1505
01:44:34,620 --> 01:44:38,340
You know, Eve, sometimes
I think you keep things from me.

1506
01:44:39,620 --> 01:44:42,780
- I don't think that's funny.
- It wasn't meant to be.

1507
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:46,500
I confide in you and rely on you
more than anyone I've ever known.

1508
01:44:46,580 --> 01:44:49,340
To say a thing like that now,
without any reason,

1509
01:44:49,420 --> 01:44:51,700
when I need you more than ever.

1510
01:44:51,780 --> 01:44:54,220
I hope you mean what you say.

1511
01:44:54,300 --> 01:44:56,700
I intend to hold you to it.

1512
01:44:57,980 --> 01:45:00,940
We have a great deal
in common, it seems to me.

1513
01:45:10,300 --> 01:45:13,940
- Well, what happened?
- Nothing much. She apologised.

1514
01:45:14,020 --> 01:45:15,900
- With tears?
- With tears.

1515
01:45:15,980 --> 01:45:19,740
But not right away. First fight them back,
chin up, stout fellow.

1516
01:45:19,820 --> 01:45:22,220
- Check.
- Very classy. Lots of technique.

1517
01:45:22,300 --> 01:45:26,940
You mean all this time she's done
nothing but apologise? What did you say?

1518
01:45:27,620 --> 01:45:29,620
Not much.

1519
01:45:32,020 --> 01:45:34,820
Groom, may I have a wedding present?

1520
01:45:34,900 --> 01:45:39,100
- What would you like? Texas?
- I want everybody to shut up about Eve.

1521
01:45:39,180 --> 01:45:41,940
Just shut up about Eve. That's all I want.

1522
01:45:42,020 --> 01:45:44,060
Give Karen more wine.

1523
01:45:44,140 --> 01:45:46,180
Never have I been so happy.

1524
01:45:46,260 --> 01:45:49,300
Isn't it a lovely room? The Cub Room.

1525
01:45:49,380 --> 01:45:53,540
What a lovely, clever name.
Where the elite meet.

1526
01:45:53,620 --> 01:45:57,780
Never have I seen so much elite,
all with their eyes on me,

1527
01:45:57,860 --> 01:46:02,140
waiting for me to crack that little
gnome on the noggin with a bottle.

1528
01:46:02,220 --> 01:46:06,460
But not tonight. I'm forgiving tonight.
Even Eve. I forgive Eve.

1529
01:46:07,420 --> 01:46:09,660
There they go.

1530
01:46:10,780 --> 01:46:12,420
There goes Eve.

1531
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:15,460
Eve Evil, little Miss Evil.

1532
01:46:16,700 --> 01:46:19,540
But "the evil that men do..."
How does that go, groom?

1533
01:46:19,620 --> 01:46:24,300
Something about the good they leave behind.
I played it once in rep in Wilkes-Barre.

1534
01:46:24,380 --> 01:46:27,020
You've got it backwards,
even for Wilkes-Barre.

1535
01:46:27,100 --> 01:46:30,620
Do you know why I forgive Eve?
She left good behind.

1536
01:46:30,900 --> 01:46:35,100
The four of us here together -
it's Eve fault. I forgive her.

1537
01:46:35,700 --> 01:46:39,860
And Bill, especially Bill. She did that too.

1538
01:46:40,220 --> 01:46:42,500
You know, she probably means well after all.

1539
01:46:42,580 --> 01:46:45,860
- She is a louse.
- Never try to outguess Margo.

1540
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:48,660
- Groom?
- Yes, dear.

1541
01:46:48,740 --> 01:46:50,940
- Do you know what I'm going to be?
- A cowboy?

1542
01:46:51,020 --> 01:46:53,980
- A married lady.
- With a paper to prove it.

1543
01:46:54,060 --> 01:46:57,740
I'm going to look up at six o'clock,
and there he'll be.

1544
01:46:58,420 --> 01:47:01,060
- Remember, Karen?
- I remember.

1545
01:47:01,940 --> 01:47:05,740
- You'll be there, won't you?
- Often enough to keep the franchise.

1546
01:47:05,820 --> 01:47:08,380
No more make-believe, offstage or on.

1547
01:47:08,660 --> 01:47:11,100
Remember, Lloyd? I mean it now.

1548
01:47:11,180 --> 01:47:14,220
Lloyd, will you promise
not to be angry with me?

1549
01:47:14,860 --> 01:47:17,540
- That depends.
- No, I mean deeply angry.

1550
01:47:17,780 --> 01:47:19,940
I don't think I could be.

1551
01:47:20,020 --> 01:47:22,900
Well, I don't want to play Cora.

1552
01:47:23,220 --> 01:47:26,340
- What?
- You're always so touchy about his plays.

1553
01:47:26,420 --> 01:47:30,620
It isn't the part. It's a great part
and a fine play. But not for me any more.

1554
01:47:30,700 --> 01:47:34,860
Not for a foursquare, upright,
downright, forthright, married lady.

1555
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:40,660
- What's your being married got to do with it?
- It means I've finally got a life to live.

1556
01:47:40,740 --> 01:47:43,540
I don't have to play parts I'm too old for

1557
01:47:43,620 --> 01:47:46,900
just because I've got
nothing to do with my nights.

1558
01:47:47,740 --> 01:47:50,260
Lloyd, I'll make it up to you, believe me.

1559
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:55,060
I'll tour a year with this one, anything.
Only you do understand, don't you?

1560
01:48:01,700 --> 01:48:04,060
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.

1561
01:48:04,460 --> 01:48:07,860
- Nothing?
- Everything. Everything's so funny.

1562
01:48:19,340 --> 01:48:21,860
Lloyd never got around to asking

1563
01:48:21,940 --> 01:48:25,860
whether it was all right with me
for Eve to play Cora.

1564
01:48:25,940 --> 01:48:30,820
Bill, oddly enough, refused to direct
the play at first... with Eve in it.

1565
01:48:30,900 --> 01:48:33,580
Lloyd and Max finally won him over.

1566
01:48:33,660 --> 01:48:39,500
Margo never came to rehearsal.
Too much to do around the house, she said.

1567
01:48:39,580 --> 01:48:43,380
I'd never known Bill and Lloyd
to fight as bitterly and often,

1568
01:48:43,460 --> 01:48:46,020
and always over some business for Eve,

1569
01:48:46,100 --> 01:48:49,380
or a move, or the way she read a speech.

1570
01:48:49,620 --> 01:48:53,220
But I'd never known Lloyd
to meddle as much with Bill's directing,

1571
01:48:53,300 --> 01:48:56,460
as far as it affected Eve, that is.

1572
01:48:56,540 --> 01:48:59,060
Somehow Eve kept them going.

1573
01:48:59,140 --> 01:49:02,540
Bill stuck it out. Lloyd seemed happy.

1574
01:49:06,260 --> 01:49:10,420
And I thought it might be best
if I skipped rehearsals from then on.

1575
01:49:12,060 --> 01:49:16,180
It seemed to me I had known always
that it would happen. And here it was.

1576
01:49:16,260 --> 01:49:20,980
I felt helpless. That helplessness you
feel when you have no talent to offer,

1577
01:49:21,060 --> 01:49:23,220
outside of loving your husband.

1578
01:49:23,300 --> 01:49:27,140
How could I compete?
Everything Lloyd loved about me,

1579
01:49:27,220 --> 01:49:29,220
he'd gotten used to long ago.

1580
01:49:34,580 --> 01:49:36,060
Hello?

1581
01:49:36,140 --> 01:49:38,340
Who? Who's calling Mr Richards?

1582
01:49:38,420 --> 01:49:42,380
My name wouldn't mean anything.
I room across the hall from Eve Harrington.

1583
01:49:42,460 --> 01:49:45,860
She isn't well. She's been crying
all night and she's hysterical.

1584
01:49:45,940 --> 01:49:48,020
She doesn't want a doctor and...

1585
01:49:48,460 --> 01:49:50,460
Who is it? What's it all about?

1586
01:49:50,540 --> 01:49:54,860
- Did Miss Harrington tell you to call?
- No. Eve didn't say to call him.

1587
01:49:54,940 --> 01:50:00,140
I saw Mr Richards with her a couple of times.
I thought, they being such good friends...

1588
01:50:00,220 --> 01:50:03,260
This is Lloyd Richards.
Where is Eve? Let me talk to her.

1589
01:50:03,340 --> 01:50:06,500
Hello, Mr Richards.
She's upstairs in her room.

1590
01:50:06,580 --> 01:50:10,220
I really hate to bother you this way,
but the way Eve's been feeling,

1591
01:50:10,300 --> 01:50:13,940
I've been worried sick, what with
her leaving tomorrowfor New Haven.

1592
01:50:14,020 --> 01:50:16,980
Tell her not to worry. Tell her I'll be right over.

1593
01:50:34,780 --> 01:50:38,020
To the theatre world,
New Haven, Connecticut,

1594
01:50:38,100 --> 01:50:42,740
is a short stretch of sidewalk between
the Shubert Theatre and the Taft Hotel,

1595
01:50:42,820 --> 01:50:46,220
surrounded by what looks
very much like a small city.

1596
01:50:46,300 --> 01:50:51,100
It is here that managers have
what are called out-of-town openings,

1597
01:50:51,180 --> 01:50:55,260
which are openings for New Yorkers
who want to go out of town.

1598
01:50:55,980 --> 01:50:59,180
What a day. What a heavenly day.

1599
01:50:59,260 --> 01:51:02,220
- D-day.
- Just like it.

1600
01:51:02,300 --> 01:51:06,460
Tomorrow morning, you will have won
your beachhead on the shores of immortality.

1601
01:51:06,540 --> 01:51:08,540
Stop rehearsing your column.

1602
01:51:09,460 --> 01:51:11,380
Isn't it strange, Addison?

1603
01:51:11,460 --> 01:51:15,620
I thought I'd be panic-stricken,
want to run away or something.

1604
01:51:15,700 --> 01:51:19,740
Instead, I can't wait for tonight
to come. To come and go.

1605
01:51:19,820 --> 01:51:21,940
Are you that sure of tomorrow?

1606
01:51:22,020 --> 01:51:24,580
- Aren't you?
- Frankly, yes.

1607
01:51:30,900 --> 01:51:32,900
It'll be a night to remember.

1608
01:51:32,980 --> 01:51:35,620
It'll bring me everything I've ever wanted.

1609
01:51:35,700 --> 01:51:38,260
The end of an old road,
the beginning of a new one.

1610
01:51:38,340 --> 01:51:42,420
- All paved with diamonds and gold?
- You know me better than that.

1611
01:51:42,500 --> 01:51:44,500
Paved with what, then?

1612
01:51:45,380 --> 01:51:47,380
Stars.

1613
01:51:48,420 --> 01:51:50,340
What time?

1614
01:51:50,420 --> 01:51:52,420
Almost four.

1615
01:51:52,980 --> 01:51:55,220
Plenty of time for a nice, long nap.

1616
01:51:55,300 --> 01:51:57,740
We rehearsed most of last night.

1617
01:51:57,820 --> 01:51:59,940
You could sleep now, couldn't you?

1618
01:52:00,020 --> 01:52:02,980
- Why not?
- The mark of a true killer.

1619
01:52:03,900 --> 01:52:06,980
Sleep tight, rest easy and come out fighting.

1620
01:52:07,060 --> 01:52:09,700
Why did you call me a killer?

1621
01:52:09,780 --> 01:52:13,860
Did I say killer? I meant champion.
I get my boxing terms mixed.

1622
01:52:15,100 --> 01:52:18,340
Addison, come in for a minute, will you?

1623
01:52:18,420 --> 01:52:20,820
I've got something to tell you.

1624
01:52:30,300 --> 01:52:33,460
Suites are for expense accounts.
You're being extravagant.

1625
01:52:33,540 --> 01:52:38,220
Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd
had a terrific row, but Lloyd insisted.

1626
01:52:39,100 --> 01:52:43,700
- Can I fix you a drink?
- With the reluctant compliments of Max?

1627
01:52:43,780 --> 01:52:46,180
Lloyd. I never have any.

1628
01:52:46,260 --> 01:52:49,420
He likes a few drinks after we finish,
so he sent it up.

1629
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:53,420
Some plain soda. Lloyd must be
expecting a record run in New Haven.

1630
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:56,860
That's for tonight. You're invited.

1631
01:52:56,940 --> 01:53:00,020
We're having everyone up
after the performance.

1632
01:53:00,100 --> 01:53:02,060
"We are"?

1633
01:53:02,140 --> 01:53:04,140
Lloyd and I.

1634
01:53:05,300 --> 01:53:08,100
I find it odd that Karen
isn't here for the opening.

1635
01:53:08,180 --> 01:53:10,660
- Addison...
- She was always so devoted to Lloyd.

1636
01:53:10,740 --> 01:53:14,380
- One would think only death could keep her...
- Addison...

1637
01:53:14,460 --> 01:53:20,740
I said this would be a night to remember,
that it would bring me all I ever wanted.

1638
01:53:20,820 --> 01:53:25,260
Something about an old road ending
and a new one starting, all paved with stars.

1639
01:53:25,340 --> 01:53:27,780
I didn't mean just the theatre.

1640
01:53:27,860 --> 01:53:29,860
What else?

1641
01:53:32,500 --> 01:53:34,940
Lloyd Richards.

1642
01:53:35,300 --> 01:53:38,780
He's going to leave Karen.
We're going to be married.

1643
01:53:40,060 --> 01:53:42,900
So that's it. Lloyd.

1644
01:53:42,980 --> 01:53:45,660
Still just the theatre, after all.

1645
01:53:45,740 --> 01:53:47,620
It's nothing of the kind.

1646
01:53:47,700 --> 01:53:49,820
Lloyd loves me. I love him.

1647
01:53:50,060 --> 01:53:54,220
I know nothing of Lloyd's loves. I leave
those to Louisa May Alcott. But I know you.

1648
01:53:54,300 --> 01:53:59,020
- I'm in love with Lloyd.
- He is a commercially successful playwright.

1649
01:53:59,300 --> 01:54:02,780
- You have no right to say that.
- And, artistically, very promising.

1650
01:54:02,860 --> 01:54:05,020
Eve, dear, this is Addison.

1651
01:54:07,220 --> 01:54:09,380
Oh, Addison, won't it be just perfect?

1652
01:54:09,460 --> 01:54:12,820
Lloyd and I.
There's no telling howfar we can go.

1653
01:54:12,900 --> 01:54:16,340
He'll write great plays for me.
I'll make them great.

1654
01:54:16,420 --> 01:54:19,260
You're the only one who knows,
except Lloyd and me.

1655
01:54:19,340 --> 01:54:21,340
- And Karen.
- She doesn't know.

1656
01:54:21,420 --> 01:54:24,300
- She knows enough not to be here.
- But not all of it.

1657
01:54:24,380 --> 01:54:27,380
- Not that Lloyd and I are gonna be married.
- I see.

1658
01:54:27,820 --> 01:54:30,980
And when was this unholy alliance joined?

1659
01:54:31,060 --> 01:54:34,460
We decided night before last,
before we came up here.

1660
01:54:34,540 --> 01:54:37,620
I trust the setting was properly romantic.

1661
01:54:37,700 --> 01:54:41,260
Lights on dimmers
and gypsy violins offstage.

1662
01:54:41,340 --> 01:54:43,660
The setting wasn't romantic,

1663
01:54:43,740 --> 01:54:45,700
but Lloyd was.

1664
01:54:45,780 --> 01:54:48,980
He woke me up at three o'clock
in the morning, banging on my door.

1665
01:54:49,060 --> 01:54:52,460
He couldn't sleep, he said. He'd left Karen.

1666
01:54:52,540 --> 01:54:56,900
Couldn't go on with the play or anything
else until I promised to marry him.

1667
01:54:56,980 --> 01:54:59,780
We sat and talked until it was light.

1668
01:54:59,860 --> 01:55:02,100
He never went home.

1669
01:55:02,180 --> 01:55:06,420
- You sat and talked until it was light?
- We sat and talked, Addison.

1670
01:55:07,460 --> 01:55:09,900
I want a run-of-the-play contract.

1671
01:55:11,380 --> 01:55:15,380
There never was, and there
never will be, another like you.

1672
01:55:16,580 --> 01:55:18,820
Well, say something. Anything.

1673
01:55:18,900 --> 01:55:21,460
Congratulations. Skål. Good work, Eve.

1674
01:55:28,060 --> 01:55:32,580
- What do you take me for?
- I don't know that I "take you" for anything.

1675
01:55:32,660 --> 01:55:35,540
Is it possible that you've confused me

1676
01:55:35,620 --> 01:55:38,820
with those backward children
you've played tricks on?

1677
01:55:38,900 --> 01:55:41,620
That you have the same contempt
for me as for them?

1678
01:55:41,700 --> 01:55:44,300
I'm sure you mean something,
but I don't know what.

1679
01:55:44,380 --> 01:55:46,860
Look closely, Eve. It's time you did.

1680
01:55:47,340 --> 01:55:51,740
I am Addison DeWitt.
I'm nobody's fool, least of all yours.

1681
01:55:52,020 --> 01:55:56,020
- I never intended you to be.
- Yes, you did, and you still do.

1682
01:55:56,100 --> 01:55:59,620
I don't know what you mean.
But I want to take my nap. It's important...

1683
01:55:59,700 --> 01:56:03,420
- It's important that we talk, killer to killer.
- Champion to champion.

1684
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:06,300
Not with me, you're no champion.
You're stepping up.

1685
01:56:06,420 --> 01:56:10,540
Please say what you have to say, plainly
and distinctly, and then let me take my nap.

1686
01:56:10,620 --> 01:56:16,220
Very well. Although it's unnecessary,
because you know what I'm going to say.

1687
01:56:16,300 --> 01:56:20,020
Lloyd may leave Karen,
but he will not leave Karen for you.

1688
01:56:20,100 --> 01:56:24,220
- What do you mean by that?
- More plainly and more distinctly?

1689
01:56:24,300 --> 01:56:27,780
I have not come to New Haven
to see the play, discuss your dreams,

1690
01:56:27,860 --> 01:56:30,580
or pull the ivy from the walls of Yale.

1691
01:56:30,660 --> 01:56:34,260
I came to tell you that you will
not marry Lloyd, or anyone else,

1692
01:56:34,340 --> 01:56:36,340
because I will not permit it.

1693
01:56:36,420 --> 01:56:38,900
- What have you got to do with it?
- Everything.

1694
01:56:39,220 --> 01:56:42,460
Because after tonight you will belong to me.

1695
01:56:42,540 --> 01:56:45,820
Belong? To you?

1696
01:56:46,740 --> 01:56:48,740
I can't believe my ears.

1697
01:56:48,820 --> 01:56:50,700
A dull cliché.

1698
01:56:50,780 --> 01:56:52,860
"Belong" to you?

1699
01:56:52,940 --> 01:56:56,060
That sounds medieval.
Something out of an old melodrama.

1700
01:56:56,140 --> 01:56:59,180
So does the history of the world
for the past 20 years.

1701
01:56:59,260 --> 01:57:01,300
I don't enjoy putting it this bluntly.

1702
01:57:01,380 --> 01:57:04,740
I'd hoped that you would have
taken it for granted that you and I...

1703
01:57:04,820 --> 01:57:06,820
"Taken it for granted"?

1704
01:57:06,900 --> 01:57:08,900
"That you and I..."?

1705
01:57:13,740 --> 01:57:16,820
Now remember, as long as you live,
never to laugh at me.

1706
01:57:16,900 --> 01:57:19,780
At anything or anyone else, but never at me.

1707
01:57:23,100 --> 01:57:26,900
- Get out.
- You're too short for that gesture.

1708
01:57:26,980 --> 01:57:29,380
Besides, it went out with Mrs Fiske.

1709
01:57:30,500 --> 01:57:33,500
Then if you won't get out,
I'll have you thrown out.

1710
01:57:33,580 --> 01:57:36,460
Don't pick up that phone. Don't even touch it.

1711
01:57:36,540 --> 01:57:38,940
Something told you to do
what I said, didn't it?

1712
01:57:39,020 --> 01:57:42,700
That instinct is worth millions.
You can't buy it, Eve. Cherish it.

1713
01:57:42,780 --> 01:57:46,100
When that alarm goes off,
go to your battle stations.

1714
01:57:47,260 --> 01:57:51,740
To begin with, your name is not Eve
Harrington. It's Gertrude Slescynski.

1715
01:57:51,820 --> 01:57:55,500
- What of it?
- True, your parents were poor, and still are.

1716
01:57:55,580 --> 01:58:00,140
They would like to know how you are. They
haven't heard from you for three years.

1717
01:58:00,220 --> 01:58:02,220
What of it?

1718
01:58:02,860 --> 01:58:04,900
A matter of opinion, granted.

1719
01:58:04,980 --> 01:58:10,940
It's also true you worked in a brewery. But
life there was not as dull as you pictured it.

1720
01:58:11,020 --> 01:58:15,660
It got less and less dull, until your boss's
wife had your boss followed by detectives.

1721
01:58:15,740 --> 01:58:19,500
- She never proved a thing!
- But the $500 you got to get out of town

1722
01:58:19,580 --> 01:58:22,700
brought you straight to New York, didn't it?

1723
01:58:30,660 --> 01:58:35,100
- That $500 brought you straight to New York.
- She was a liar. She was a liar!

1724
01:58:35,180 --> 01:58:38,700
Answer my question.
Weren't you paid to get out of town?

1725
01:58:41,860 --> 01:58:45,340
There was no Eddie, no pilot.
You've never been married.

1726
01:58:45,420 --> 01:58:50,180
That was not only a lie, it was an insult to
dead heroes and the women who loved them.

1727
01:58:50,260 --> 01:58:54,340
San Francisco has no Shubert Theatre.
You've never been to San Francisco.

1728
01:58:54,420 --> 01:58:57,940
That was a stupid lie, easy to expose,
not worthy of you.

1729
01:58:58,020 --> 01:59:02,940
I had to get in to meet Margo. I had to say
something, be somebody. Make her like me!

1730
01:59:03,020 --> 01:59:05,260
She did like you. She helped and trusted you.

1731
01:59:05,340 --> 01:59:08,180
- You repaid her by trying to win Bill.
- That's not true!

1732
01:59:08,260 --> 01:59:12,260
I was there. I saw you and heard you
through the dressing-room door.

1733
01:59:13,020 --> 01:59:16,540
You used my name to blackmail Karen
into getting you the part of Cora.

1734
01:59:16,620 --> 01:59:19,580
- You lied to me about it.
- No!

1735
01:59:19,780 --> 01:59:22,420
I had lunch with Karen not three hours ago.

1736
01:59:22,500 --> 01:59:27,260
As always with women who try to find out
things, she told more than she learnt.

1737
01:59:28,020 --> 01:59:32,140
Now do you want to change your story about
Lloyd beating at your door that night?

1738
01:59:32,220 --> 01:59:34,020
Please, please.

1739
01:59:38,380 --> 01:59:43,380
That I should want you at all suddenly
strikes me as the height of improbability.

1740
01:59:43,460 --> 01:59:46,940
But that in itself is probably the reason.

1741
01:59:47,020 --> 01:59:51,700
You're an improbable person, Eve,
and so am I. We have that in common.

1742
01:59:51,780 --> 01:59:55,900
Also a contempt for humanity,
an inability to love and be loved.

1743
01:59:55,980 --> 01:59:59,620
Insatiable ambition... and talent.

1744
01:59:59,700 --> 02:00:03,020
We deserve each other.
Are you listening to me?

1745
02:00:05,220 --> 02:00:08,020
- Then say so.
- Yes, Addison.

1746
02:00:08,300 --> 02:00:12,180
And you realise and you agree
how completely you belong to me?

1747
02:00:12,620 --> 02:00:14,180
Yes, Addison.

1748
02:00:14,780 --> 02:00:18,020
Then take your nap,
and good luck for tonight.

1749
02:00:22,980 --> 02:00:24,940
I won't play tonight.

1750
02:00:25,020 --> 02:00:29,460
I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on.

1751
02:00:29,540 --> 02:00:33,580
"Couldn't go on"?
You'll give the performance of your life.

1752
02:00:51,500 --> 02:00:54,420
And she gave the performance of her life.

1753
02:00:54,500 --> 02:00:57,100
And it was a night to remember, that night.

1754
02:01:06,820 --> 02:01:09,820
Honoured members of
the Sarah Siddons Society,

1755
02:01:09,900 --> 02:01:13,220
distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.

1756
02:01:14,460 --> 02:01:16,820
What is there for me to say?

1757
02:01:16,900 --> 02:01:20,220
Everything wise and witty
has long since been said

1758
02:01:20,300 --> 02:01:24,580
by minds more mature
and talents far greater than mine.

1759
02:01:24,660 --> 02:01:28,020
For me to thank you as equals
would be presumptuous.

1760
02:01:28,100 --> 02:01:30,500
I am an apprentice in the theatre,

1761
02:01:30,580 --> 02:01:33,580
and have much to learn from all of you.

1762
02:01:33,660 --> 02:01:37,180
Let me say only that I am proud and happy,

1763
02:01:38,100 --> 02:01:41,020
and that I regard this great honour

1764
02:01:41,100 --> 02:01:44,180
not so much as an award
for what I have achieved,

1765
02:01:44,260 --> 02:01:48,340
but as a standard to hold against
what I have yet to accomplish.

1766
02:01:49,700 --> 02:01:54,500
And, further, that I regard it
as bestowed upon me only in part.

1767
02:01:55,580 --> 02:01:59,940
The larger share belongs
to my friends in the theatre,

1768
02:02:00,020 --> 02:02:02,500
and to the theatre itself

1769
02:02:02,580 --> 02:02:05,380
which has given me all I have.

1770
02:02:06,740 --> 02:02:10,740
In good conscience,
I must give credit where credit is due.

1771
02:02:12,180 --> 02:02:15,660
To Max Fabian. Dear Max.

1772
02:02:16,140 --> 02:02:20,140
Dear sentimental, generous,
courageous Max Fabian,

1773
02:02:20,220 --> 02:02:23,940
who took a chance on
an unknown, untried amateur.

1774
02:02:28,420 --> 02:02:31,860
To my first friend in the theatre,

1775
02:02:31,940 --> 02:02:35,700
whose kindness and graciousness
I shall never forget,

1776
02:02:35,780 --> 02:02:38,180
Karen. Mrs Lloyd Richards.

1777
02:02:44,100 --> 02:02:47,900
It was Karen who first brought me
to one whom I'd always idolised,

1778
02:02:47,980 --> 02:02:51,180
one who became
my benefactress and champion.

1779
02:02:52,340 --> 02:02:56,020
A great actress and a great woman,

1780
02:02:56,420 --> 02:02:58,460
Margo Channing.

1781
02:03:03,100 --> 02:03:05,420
To my director,

1782
02:03:05,500 --> 02:03:10,260
who demanded always a little more
than my talent could provide,

1783
02:03:10,340 --> 02:03:12,940
but who taught me patiently and well,

1784
02:03:14,500 --> 02:03:16,500
Bill Sampson.

1785
02:03:19,180 --> 02:03:23,100
And one without whose
great play and faith in me,

1786
02:03:23,780 --> 02:03:26,460
this night could never have been.

1787
02:03:26,540 --> 02:03:28,900
How can I repay Lloyd Richards?

1788
02:03:31,620 --> 02:03:33,860
How can I repay the many others,

1789
02:03:33,940 --> 02:03:36,900
so many, I couldn't possibly name them all,

1790
02:03:36,980 --> 02:03:39,940
whose help, guidance, and advice

1791
02:03:41,420 --> 02:03:46,340
have made this, the happiest
night of my life, possible.

1792
02:03:50,540 --> 02:03:54,420
Although I am going to Hollywood
next week to make a film,

1793
02:03:54,500 --> 02:03:57,660
do not think for a moment
that I am leaving you.

1794
02:03:57,740 --> 02:03:59,860
How could I?

1795
02:03:59,940 --> 02:04:02,660
My heart is here in the theatre,

1796
02:04:02,740 --> 02:04:07,020
and 3,000 miles are too far
to be away from one's heart.

1797
02:04:07,140 --> 02:04:10,020
I'll be back to claim it... and soon.

1798
02:04:11,660 --> 02:04:15,380
That is, if you want me back.

1799
02:04:21,660 --> 02:04:24,740
Good night to you all,
and to all, a good night.

1800
02:04:32,060 --> 02:04:36,340
For services rendered beyond...
whatever it is of duty, darling.

1801
02:04:40,940 --> 02:04:46,020
Come on, I'm the host. I got to get home
before my guests start stealing the liquor.

1802
02:04:48,660 --> 02:04:51,420
- Congratulations, Eve.
- Thank you, Karen.

1803
02:04:54,780 --> 02:04:58,580
- Congratulations, Miss Harrington.
- Thank you so much.

1804
02:04:59,220 --> 02:05:03,820
Nice speech, Eve. But I wouldn't worry
too much about your heart.

1805
02:05:03,900 --> 02:05:07,500
You can always put that award
where your heart ought to be.

1806
02:05:09,900 --> 02:05:11,900
I don't suppose there's a drink left?

1807
02:05:11,980 --> 02:05:14,660
- You can have one at Max's.
- I don't think I'm going.

1808
02:05:14,740 --> 02:05:18,620
- Why not?
- Because I don't want to.

1809
02:05:18,700 --> 02:05:22,140
- I'm so happy for you, Eve.
- Thank you so much.

1810
02:05:23,540 --> 02:05:28,420
Max has gone to a lot of trouble. This is going
to be an elaborate party and it's for you.

1811
02:05:28,500 --> 02:05:31,900
No, it isn't. It's for this.

1812
02:05:31,980 --> 02:05:34,580
- It's the same thing, isn't it?
- Exactly.

1813
02:05:35,820 --> 02:05:38,580
Here, take it to the party instead of me.

1814
02:05:38,660 --> 02:05:40,820
You're being very childish.

1815
02:05:40,900 --> 02:05:44,940
- I'm tired. I want to go home.
- Very well. I'll drop you off.

1816
02:05:45,020 --> 02:05:48,500
I shall go to the party alone.
I have no intention of missing it.

1817
02:07:11,500 --> 02:07:13,540
- Who are you?
- Miss Harrington.

1818
02:07:13,620 --> 02:07:17,260
- What are you doing here?
- I... I guess I fell asleep.

1819
02:07:20,260 --> 02:07:24,180
Please don't have me arrested.
I didn't steal anything. You can search me.

1820
02:07:24,260 --> 02:07:28,060
- How did you get in here?
- I hid outside till the maid came in.

1821
02:07:28,140 --> 02:07:30,860
She went out to get something
and left the door open.

1822
02:07:30,940 --> 02:07:34,860
I sneaked in and hid till she'd finished.
Then I just looked around.

1823
02:07:34,940 --> 02:07:38,540
I was afraid someone would notice
the lights were on, so I turned them off.

1824
02:07:38,620 --> 02:07:42,060
- Then I guess I fell asleep.
- You were just looking around?

1825
02:07:42,140 --> 02:07:43,980
- That's all.
- What for?

1826
02:07:44,060 --> 02:07:46,620
- You probably won't believe me.
- Probably not.

1827
02:07:46,700 --> 02:07:49,060
- It was for my report.
- What report? To whom?

1828
02:07:49,140 --> 02:07:51,900
About how you live,
what kind of clothes you wear,

1829
02:07:51,980 --> 02:07:55,940
what kind of perfume
and books, things like that.

1830
02:07:56,020 --> 02:07:59,900
You know the Eve Harrington Club that
they have in most girls' high schools?

1831
02:07:59,980 --> 02:08:03,820
- I've heard of them.
- Ours was one of the first - Erasmus Hall.

1832
02:08:03,900 --> 02:08:08,020
- I'm the president.
- Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?

1833
02:08:08,100 --> 02:08:12,340
Lots of actresses come from Brooklyn.
Barbara Stanwyck and Susan Hayward.

1834
02:08:12,420 --> 02:08:14,740
Of course, they're just movie stars.

1835
02:08:14,820 --> 02:08:17,380
You're going to Hollywood, aren't you?

1836
02:08:18,780 --> 02:08:22,260
From the trunks you're packing,
you must be going to stay a long time.

1837
02:08:22,340 --> 02:08:24,340
I might.

1838
02:08:28,180 --> 02:08:30,980
That spilled drink's gonna ruin your carpet.

1839
02:08:31,060 --> 02:08:33,460
Maid'll fix it in the morning.

1840
02:08:34,340 --> 02:08:37,140
- I'll just clean up the mess.
- Don't bother.

1841
02:08:37,980 --> 02:08:40,900
- How'd you get up here from Brooklyn?
- Subway.

1842
02:08:41,980 --> 02:08:44,140
How long does it take?

1843
02:08:44,220 --> 02:08:47,020
With changing and everything,
a little over an hour.

1844
02:08:47,100 --> 02:08:50,620
It's after one now.
You won't get home till all hours.

1845
02:08:52,380 --> 02:08:54,380
I don't care if I never get home.

1846
02:08:56,620 --> 02:08:58,620
That's the door.

1847
02:09:01,580 --> 02:09:03,580
You rest. I'll get it.

1848
02:09:11,420 --> 02:09:13,620
Hello. Who are you?

1849
02:09:14,420 --> 02:09:18,300
Miss Harrington's resting, Mr DeWitt.
She asked me to see who it is.

1850
02:09:18,380 --> 02:09:20,380
Well, we won't disturb her rest.

1851
02:09:20,460 --> 02:09:25,380
It seems Miss Harrington left her award
in the taxi cab. Will you give it to her?

1852
02:09:26,620 --> 02:09:29,460
Tell me, how did you know my name?

1853
02:09:30,220 --> 02:09:32,820
It's a very famous name, Mr DeWitt.

1854
02:09:32,900 --> 02:09:35,220
- And what's your name?
- Phoebe.

1855
02:09:35,860 --> 02:09:38,740
- Phoebe?
- I call myself Phoebe.

1856
02:09:40,060 --> 02:09:41,860
And why not?

1857
02:09:41,940 --> 02:09:47,060
Tell me, Phoebe, do you want someday
to have an award like that of your own?

1858
02:09:47,140 --> 02:09:52,340
- More than anything else in the world.
- Then ask Miss Harrington how to get one.

1859
02:09:53,460 --> 02:09:56,260
Miss Harrington knows all about it.

1860
02:10:04,460 --> 02:10:06,540
Who was it?

1861
02:10:06,620 --> 02:10:08,700
Just a taxi driver, Miss Harrington.

1862
02:10:08,780 --> 02:10:12,500
You left your award in his cab,
and he brought it back.

1863
02:10:12,580 --> 02:10:16,460
Put it on one of the trunks,
will you? I wanna pack it.

1864
02:10:16,540 --> 02:10:18,540
Sure, Miss Harrington.

1865
02:10:19,305 --> 02:10:25,390
