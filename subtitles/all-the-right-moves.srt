Ampipe Bulldogs. Ampipe Bulldogs.
Ampipe Bulldogs.

00:03:04,774 --> 00:03:06,818
Ampipe.

4
00:04:00,038 --> 00:04:01,873
- Bye, Pop.
Morning, Stefen.

5
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,833
Greg.

6
00:04:26,773 --> 00:04:29,108
- Stef, we gonna beat Walnut Heights?
You know it.

7
00:04:29,275 --> 00:04:30,610
All right! Get in.

8
00:05:09,107 --> 00:05:12,068
Hurry up.
Hey, wait up.

9
00:05:12,235 --> 00:05:14,487
There you go.

10
00:05:18,491 --> 00:05:21,786
The Stinger!
- You take good care of Charlotte?

11
00:05:21,953 --> 00:05:25,123
- She's my freak of the week.
- Shadow, damn you!

12
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:27,917
You know when people die
and they donate stuff?

13
00:05:28,126 --> 00:05:31,671
Well, I'm gonna donate
my dick to Charlotte.

14
00:05:34,549 --> 00:05:40,138
Here comes my nervous breakdown.
I'll see you guys later. Take care.

15
00:05:48,062 --> 00:05:52,859
- Why is what's-her-name crying?
- Her and her boyfriend are breaking up.

16
00:05:53,025 --> 00:05:58,489
I bet I know why. I mean most guys
aren't as understanding as I am, Lisa.

17
00:05:58,656 --> 00:06:01,743
I know that, Stef.

18
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:06,706
- What did you do? Swim to school?
- Yeah, my chauffeur was a little late.

19
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,710
- Stefo.
Hey, Tracy.

20
00:06:10,877 --> 00:06:14,964
- You got my English?
I got your English right here.

21
00:06:15,173 --> 00:06:18,217
You want your English?
You want his English?

22
00:06:18,384 --> 00:06:20,052
- No?
Come on.

23
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:24,640
- I'm not sure about 20 and 21.
- How do you know football stuff...

24
00:06:24,807 --> 00:06:26,893
...and not know how to conjugate a verb?

25
00:06:27,059 --> 00:06:28,978
- What's a verb?
- What's a hand-on?

26
00:06:29,145 --> 00:06:32,398
- What's a hand-on?
- I taught you Saturday night.

27
00:06:32,565 --> 00:06:34,442
Stef!

28
00:06:35,401 --> 00:06:37,278
- Come on.
See you at lunch.

29
00:06:37,445 --> 00:06:38,905
Yeah, you buy, right?

30
00:06:40,781 --> 00:06:43,159
Tracy, come on.

31
00:06:43,326 --> 00:06:46,496
Tracy, come on. Come on.

32
00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:49,582
All right, brain pump.

33
00:06:53,794 --> 00:06:58,049
Harry.
- Hey, brothers.

34
00:06:59,342 --> 00:07:01,636
Give me a break, man.

35
00:07:22,031 --> 00:07:23,699
- Vinnie.

36
00:07:23,866 --> 00:07:27,620
She keeps looking back here. Do it.

37
00:07:27,787 --> 00:07:29,247
- No way.
- Come on.

38
00:07:29,413 --> 00:07:31,165
No.

39
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,710
- Come on.
- No.

40
00:07:34,877 --> 00:07:38,339
- Guinea.
- Okay.

41
00:08:30,808 --> 00:08:33,436
Vucci. Vucci. Vinnie!

42
00:08:46,532 --> 00:08:50,119
You got something to share
with us, Mr. Salvucci?

43
00:08:50,286 --> 00:08:54,749
- Can I leave the room?
Yeah, I think you'd better.

44
00:09:12,433 --> 00:09:15,186
Don't tell me that hurt.
- Yes, it hurt.

45
00:09:15,352 --> 00:09:18,272
You ruined my chances
for a scholarship.

46
00:09:18,439 --> 00:09:20,691
Have you heard
from any recruiters?

47
00:09:20,858 --> 00:09:24,862
You know the reason I'm playing
is because Prazowicz is hurt.

48
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:28,157
- You still got a shot.
- Right, for welfare.

49
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,792
Stef?

50
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:43,130
Stef? Are you in here?

51
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,591
Stef?

52
00:09:48,844 --> 00:09:50,888
Stef?

53
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:53,516
I got the lunch.

54
00:09:55,976 --> 00:09:57,436
You are my lunch.

55
00:10:02,107 --> 00:10:06,278
Scared you, Lietzke?
- No.

56
00:10:07,238 --> 00:10:12,326
- Next time, you go. I almost got busted.
- You want me to get busted?

57
00:10:12,535 --> 00:10:16,789
No one's gonna put you on report
the week of the Walnut Heights game.

58
00:10:16,956 --> 00:10:20,167
Yeah, Walnut Heights, huh?

59
00:10:20,626 --> 00:10:24,046
There's gonna be recruiters
from every college.

60
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:29,426
All to see Stefen Djordjevic.

61
00:10:29,593 --> 00:10:32,680
Only it's no joke.

62
00:10:32,846 --> 00:10:35,683
Walnut Heights have the best
halfback in the state.

63
00:10:35,849 --> 00:10:39,603
I knock him on his ass,
I'll have my pick of colleges.

64
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,314
You pick one near home, huh.

65
00:10:46,026 --> 00:10:48,654
Yeah, I'd like to.

66
00:10:48,821 --> 00:10:51,448
This is my shot.

67
00:10:51,615 --> 00:10:55,286
This is my way out Friday night.

68
00:10:56,996 --> 00:11:03,043
And I gotta go to the best school,
with the best engineering program.

69
00:11:06,964 --> 00:11:11,010
Djordjevices have been humping
steel out of this town for years.

70
00:11:11,218 --> 00:11:15,180
You know, Grandpa, Pop, Greg.

71
00:11:15,347 --> 00:11:18,684
I mean, you know,
it's about time one of us...

72
00:11:18,851 --> 00:11:23,439
...had something to say
about the stuff after it's been made.

73
00:11:23,772 --> 00:11:26,525
And it's gonna be me.

74
00:11:31,613 --> 00:11:34,283
- You're making fun. You're laughing.
- No.

75
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,660
- Yes, you are.

76
00:11:37,202 --> 00:11:38,454
Those fries are terrible.

77
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,125
Is someone in here?

78
00:11:44,334 --> 00:11:47,504
Is it you, Salvucci?

79
00:11:47,755 --> 00:11:50,049
If it is, you're in bad trouble.

80
00:11:56,221 --> 00:11:59,516
- The University of Southern Cal.
- Bullshit.

81
00:11:59,683 --> 00:12:04,063
No, no bullshit. A full fucking ride, man!

82
00:12:04,229 --> 00:12:08,067
- We're getting out of here, buddy.
I know. Shit!

83
00:12:09,109 --> 00:12:14,323
Excuse me, ladies. Brian Riley
is going to SC, motherfuckers!

84
00:12:14,531 --> 00:12:16,283
All right.

85
00:12:16,492 --> 00:12:19,244
All I gotta do is maintain
my 2.0 average-

86
00:12:19,411 --> 00:12:23,040
- You can do that if you cheat.
- Bonehead is going to Hollywood.

87
00:12:23,248 --> 00:12:27,419
- Maybe you better take us with you.
- We make you look good.

88
00:12:27,628 --> 00:12:30,464
I don't have to shovel
any more damn snow.

89
00:12:30,672 --> 00:12:34,259
You might not shovel snow,
but you will shovel earthquakes.

90
00:12:34,468 --> 00:12:39,306
I'll be playing in the Rose Bowl.
You guys will watch me on TV.

91
00:12:39,515 --> 00:12:43,560
You going to Hollywood,
you're gonna have to learn to dress.

92
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:47,856
- And dance.
- That's right. You gotta be cool, man.

93
00:12:48,065 --> 00:12:51,527
One, two. Come on.
Come on, man, come on. One...

94
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:56,615
- Shake it out, Bri.
Hey, Fox, show me how to do that.

95
00:13:04,122 --> 00:13:08,669
Okay, now you've got
to be gliding. Come on.

96
00:13:08,877 --> 00:13:12,005
Move your hands
just like you're a puppet.

97
00:13:13,298 --> 00:13:16,343
- This shit comes in handy.
You know it.

98
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:21,265
Mouse, wake up and check this out.
Not bad for a white boy, eh?

99
00:13:21,473 --> 00:13:24,935
You look horrible. No wonder
you get beat on defense.

100
00:13:25,143 --> 00:13:28,438
Yeah? Who's wearing the letter, pal?

101
00:13:29,314 --> 00:13:33,360
Bri, you ain't never gonna be
one of them exotic dancers.

102
00:13:35,571 --> 00:13:38,240
It's a good thing.

103
00:13:38,448 --> 00:13:41,535
- Don't give her too much now.
- Yeah. Charlotte.

104
00:13:41,702 --> 00:13:45,872
- Charlotte?
- Just tease it, Charlotte.

105
00:13:53,171 --> 00:13:54,756
Ladies!

106
00:13:58,051 --> 00:13:59,428
Five minutes.

107
00:14:08,645 --> 00:14:13,525
Look, I've been up all night.
I want you to take a look at this.

108
00:14:13,692 --> 00:14:16,570
If we play straight,
they're gonna blow us out.

109
00:14:16,737 --> 00:14:21,366
But if we force them to pass,
we can take away the edge they got.

110
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:24,911
We'll put our linemen a yard
and a half off the ball.

111
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,789
-62 stack?
- Yeah. Submarine every play.

112
00:14:27,956 --> 00:14:31,168
- Goal line defense the entire game?
- Yeah.

113
00:14:31,335 --> 00:14:34,171
When Alexander comes up,
all he's gonna find is people.

114
00:14:34,338 --> 00:14:38,133
- What if he tries to break around end?
- We got our linebackers.

115
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,720
- If they pass, we're too quick.
- Nobody's ever tried it.

116
00:14:42,971 --> 00:14:47,601
If it works, we're geniuses.
If it doesn't, what've we got to lose?

117
00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:50,312
Our lives.

118
00:14:51,313 --> 00:14:54,983
Right. So let's make it work, Jess.

119
00:14:55,192 --> 00:14:59,279
I want you to attack the legs
of the man in front of you.

120
00:14:59,446 --> 00:15:02,574
Get your ass up, Nicatancous.

121
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,452
- Get down! Ready!
Go, Tank!

122
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:09,247
34! Blue!
Great. That's where we want you.

123
00:15:09,456 --> 00:15:13,585
- All right.
23! 22! Hut!

124
00:15:13,752 --> 00:15:16,463
Hut! Hut! Hut!

125
00:15:19,174 --> 00:15:22,302
Get in there! Hit their knees!

126
00:15:22,469 --> 00:15:25,305
All right, that was good. That was good.

127
00:15:28,934 --> 00:15:33,021
What the hell's coach got us doing?
Don't ask, just do it.

128
00:15:33,188 --> 00:15:36,108
See who's over there watching us?

129
00:15:36,274 --> 00:15:37,734
Not us. Nickerson.

130
00:15:37,901 --> 00:15:40,987
Riley, come here.
Alexander, come here.

131
00:15:41,154 --> 00:15:44,658
Riley, this is Alexander.
Follow him the entire game.

132
00:15:44,866 --> 00:15:46,535
And it's your key, son.

133
00:15:46,701 --> 00:15:49,120
He goes to take a crap,
show him the way.

134
00:15:49,287 --> 00:15:50,330
- Understand?
- Yes.

135
00:15:50,497 --> 00:15:51,957
- Can you handle it?
- Yes!

136
00:15:52,123 --> 00:15:53,208
- I can't hear you!
- Yes!

137
00:15:53,542 --> 00:15:56,795
All right, I trust you.

138
00:15:56,962 --> 00:16:00,757
Safeties, I want you right
up here with the linebackers.

139
00:16:00,924 --> 00:16:03,927
If they block down,
I want you shooting down.

140
00:16:04,094 --> 00:16:08,807
Djordjevic, get in here, wuss.
What's your key in this formation?

141
00:16:08,974 --> 00:16:11,518
I cover the tailback
or go with the flow.

142
00:16:11,726 --> 00:16:15,480
Listen, they can't run
against a 6-2 stack, okay?

143
00:16:15,647 --> 00:16:17,732
We're gonna force them to pass.

144
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:19,860
- Who are we?
Ampipe!

145
00:16:20,026 --> 00:16:22,028
- What are we?
- Bulldogs!

146
00:16:22,237 --> 00:16:23,405
What are we?
Bulldogs!

147
00:16:23,572 --> 00:16:24,614
Who are we gonna beat?

148
00:16:24,781 --> 00:16:28,910
You keep them here all night
till they get it right, okay?

149
00:16:29,077 --> 00:16:31,746
Will do, coach.

150
00:16:32,247 --> 00:16:38,044
- How are we gonna beat them?
2-2! Blue!

151
00:16:45,844 --> 00:16:51,182
Here we go now.
Here we go. 22. Blue.

152
00:17:03,737 --> 00:17:06,239
Hi, baby.

153
00:17:07,365 --> 00:17:10,076
Well?
- Yeah, well. It was great.

154
00:17:10,243 --> 00:17:13,622
Those guys from Cal Poly
stayed the whole time.

155
00:17:13,788 --> 00:17:15,332
- And?
- Yeah, well...

156
00:17:15,498 --> 00:17:18,335
...we're gonna grab
a few beers, eight or nine.

157
00:17:18,501 --> 00:17:20,962
Eight or nine?

158
00:17:21,504 --> 00:17:23,340
- That's great.
- Yeah, it is.

159
00:17:23,506 --> 00:17:26,593
I got a good shot at
defensive backfield coach.

160
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,429
It's down to me
and a guy from Aliquippa.

161
00:17:29,596 --> 00:17:32,724
Yeah, he's good, but you're better.

162
00:17:32,891 --> 00:17:35,477
- We're gonna get out of here.
- Yeah.

163
00:17:40,065 --> 00:17:44,319
Mr. Djordjevic, we'd like him
to come to our school.

164
00:17:44,486 --> 00:17:46,196
- Djordjevic.
- I'm sorry.

165
00:17:46,363 --> 00:17:49,491
- To play football?
- And to get an education.

166
00:17:50,075 --> 00:17:52,077
Would you tell us about that?

167
00:17:52,243 --> 00:17:54,913
We'll do everything
to see he gets his diploma.

168
00:17:55,121 --> 00:17:58,666
We have tutoring to help him
get his degree.

169
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,753
Our people graduate, Mr. Djordjevic.

170
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,424
We'd like you to visit the campus.
Take a look at the conditions.

171
00:18:06,591 --> 00:18:08,635
Meet the coaches, the players.

172
00:18:08,802 --> 00:18:13,139
We got two alumni in the pros now.
One of them is All-Conference.

173
00:18:13,306 --> 00:18:15,350
Do you want to play pro ball?

174
00:18:15,517 --> 00:18:17,102
Me?

175
00:18:18,061 --> 00:18:19,813
How about it, Pop?

176
00:18:19,979 --> 00:18:24,484
No, there's not much call for a 5' 10"
white cornerback in the NFL.

177
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:31,032
- I could do the job in college, though.
- Yes, you can. You hit like a truck.

178
00:18:31,241 --> 00:18:32,867
What are you looking for?

179
00:18:33,076 --> 00:18:36,121
I'm looking to trade football
for an education.

180
00:18:36,329 --> 00:18:39,624
- I'm gonna be an engineer.
I checked your grades.

181
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:43,461
A "B" average
is not going to get you a scholarship.

182
00:18:43,628 --> 00:18:48,341
- I know that.
- Well? We offer a B.S. in engineering.

183
00:18:49,551 --> 00:18:53,721
Yeah, well... You know,
Mr. Smith, I like your school.

184
00:18:53,888 --> 00:18:56,516
It's got a pretty good football team.

185
00:18:56,683 --> 00:19:02,021
But to tell you honestly, there's
other schools I'd rather look at first.

186
00:19:06,568 --> 00:19:10,363
Maybe you do belong
at another school, Stef.

187
00:19:10,572 --> 00:19:13,741
Mr. Smith, because my son
is good at football...

188
00:19:13,908 --> 00:19:17,620
...he has opportunities
that otherwise would not be his.

189
00:19:17,787 --> 00:19:21,583
I'd like to thank you for coming
and offering them.

190
00:19:21,749 --> 00:19:25,169
I know what you're thinking,
what you're looking for.

191
00:19:25,336 --> 00:19:27,171
Maybe I don't blame you.

192
00:19:27,338 --> 00:19:30,925
If things fall through,
you've got a place with me.

193
00:19:31,092 --> 00:19:34,053
Okay, thank you.

194
00:19:43,438 --> 00:19:45,106
I hope you know what you're doing.

195
00:19:46,566 --> 00:19:48,818
- That's Lisa. Pop, can I go?
- Stefen.

196
00:19:48,985 --> 00:19:53,448
Don't worry. I'm gonna get
a good scholarship to a good school.

197
00:19:53,656 --> 00:19:56,618
They haven't been
beating down the door.

198
00:19:56,826 --> 00:20:01,289
Yeah, you just wait till they
see me in the Walnut Heights game.

199
00:21:29,627 --> 00:21:32,171
Stef, stop. Stef.

200
00:21:35,007 --> 00:21:38,761
Stef, stop.

201
00:21:42,014 --> 00:21:43,933
Stef.

202
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:46,727
Stop!

203
00:21:56,529 --> 00:21:59,157
I want to go home.

204
00:22:02,118 --> 00:22:08,166
- You don't have to be mad. Look at me.
- I'm looking at you. I'm not mad.

205
00:22:09,292 --> 00:22:15,006
Listen, I'm sorry. I guess I shouldn't
have let it go that far.

206
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:21,012
- See you tomorrow?
- We have history and lunch, right?

207
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:26,267
Right, Stef. Look, I'm scared,
and you're going away.

208
00:22:26,434 --> 00:22:30,313
I don't understand it.
It's not like I don't love you.

209
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:35,484
We've been going out a long time and...

210
00:22:36,652 --> 00:22:40,072
...Brian and those guys see me here.
Nothing is going on.

211
00:22:40,239 --> 00:22:43,659
- Brian? Brian?
- I didn't mean that.

212
00:22:43,826 --> 00:22:47,288
- Brian, right.
- Lisa, I didn't mean that.

213
00:22:47,496 --> 00:22:51,500
I don't want it to be for Brian
or anybody else.

214
00:22:51,667 --> 00:22:57,715
- I want it to be special and not in a car.
- Okay.

215
00:22:59,717 --> 00:23:02,762
I understand. Let's go home.

216
00:23:13,147 --> 00:23:14,523
Go!

217
00:23:17,568 --> 00:23:19,320
Halt!

218
00:23:19,487 --> 00:23:24,575
Nicatancous, what are you doing?
You spin all the way from here.

219
00:23:24,742 --> 00:23:27,870
You really piss me off!
What's wrong with you?

220
00:23:28,037 --> 00:23:29,872
Nothing.
- That wasn't a block!

221
00:23:30,081 --> 00:23:31,415
- I can't hear you!
- Nothing, sir.

222
00:23:31,582 --> 00:23:34,126
What was that?
That was a third-base slide!

223
00:23:34,293 --> 00:23:37,088
You block about as good
as a jelly doughnut.

224
00:23:37,254 --> 00:23:41,008
- That was nothing! Are you listening?
- Yes!

225
00:23:41,175 --> 00:23:44,887
- You want to play against Walnut Heights?
- Yes, sir.

226
00:23:45,054 --> 00:23:46,972
- Convince us you're a dog.
- Yes, sir.

227
00:23:47,139 --> 00:23:50,017
I want you pissing on every
fire hydrant in Walnut Heights.

228
00:23:50,184 --> 00:23:52,603
- Yes, sir.
- Get down on your knees! Now growl!

229
00:23:53,979 --> 00:23:56,148
You bite! You dig!

230
00:23:56,315 --> 00:23:59,068
- You want to go to college?
- Yes, sir.

231
00:23:59,235 --> 00:24:02,279
- Then play the way you've been taught!
Break!

232
00:24:02,488 --> 00:24:04,573
Ready?
Break!

233
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:09,036
Dig in there, dig in there.
Formation right!

234
00:24:09,537 --> 00:24:13,124
Set! Ready! Go!

235
00:24:18,921 --> 00:24:23,509
No. Mouse, give me that ball.
Djordjevic, what are you doing here?

236
00:24:23,676 --> 00:24:27,179
I've told you 1000 times,
go for the ball not the man.

237
00:24:27,346 --> 00:24:32,643
This is a football, see?
That's a man. There is a man over there.

238
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:35,604
- Do that in a game, we got a penalty.
I had the coverage.

239
00:24:35,771 --> 00:24:39,066
- What?
- I had the coverage, sir. I made the play.

240
00:24:39,233 --> 00:24:45,114
- You do it my way, or it's the highway!
- Hustle on in. Hey, hustle up. Hustle up.

241
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,375
- A good practice, gentlemen.
All right!

242
00:24:56,542 --> 00:24:59,420
Today you're not ladies, you're gentlemen.

243
00:24:59,587 --> 00:25:01,422
- We got any quitters?
No!

244
00:25:01,589 --> 00:25:04,175
- I didn't hear you.
- No, sir!

245
00:25:04,341 --> 00:25:08,095
You quit on this field,
you're gonna quit high school...

246
00:25:08,262 --> 00:25:11,473
...you're gonna quit your job, your lady.

247
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,144
You know what you're gonna
end up being? Quitters and losers!

248
00:25:15,311 --> 00:25:18,147
None of you guys are quitters and losers!

249
00:25:18,314 --> 00:25:19,857
- Any quitters here?
- No!

250
00:25:20,482 --> 00:25:21,901
- Didn't hear you.
- No!

251
00:25:22,067 --> 00:25:23,527
- Can't hear you.
- No, sir!

252
00:25:24,695 --> 00:25:29,074
All right, everybody, five laps. Five laps!

253
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,036
You do 10.

254
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:38,334
- Why are you so hard on Djordjevic?
- Shit.

255
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,378
He's good, he's got talent.
You know what?

256
00:25:41,462 --> 00:25:43,839
He's using me, Jess. He's using me.

257
00:25:44,006 --> 00:25:45,674
Hey...

258
00:25:46,008 --> 00:25:47,760
...relax.

259
00:25:48,385 --> 00:25:54,183
- They're gonna give you the job.
- Yeah? Christ, I hope so.

260
00:26:23,045 --> 00:26:26,507
Ready. Okay.

261
00:26:26,674 --> 00:26:29,301
When I say, "Ampipe,"
you say, "Bulldogs. "

262
00:26:29,468 --> 00:26:30,886
- Ampipe.
Bulldogs!

263
00:26:31,053 --> 00:26:32,596
Ampipe!
- Bulldogs!

264
00:26:32,763 --> 00:26:35,599
- When I say, "let's," you say, "go. " Let's.
- Go!

265
00:26:35,766 --> 00:26:36,809
- Let's.
- Go!

266
00:27:00,332 --> 00:27:06,964
All right, team, get it together.
Go, Bulldogs!

267
00:27:21,895 --> 00:27:28,152
This rally, this game
is not just for the students.

268
00:27:28,318 --> 00:27:32,114
It's for the whole town.

269
00:27:32,906 --> 00:27:39,580
It's for the mothers,
for the fathers and the steelworkers!

270
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:47,754
And now, here's the man
who's gonna bring us a victory...

271
00:27:47,921 --> 00:27:54,344
...and who's gonna make Ampipe
what it used to be. Coach Nickerson!

272
00:27:59,057 --> 00:28:01,393
Walnut Heights is undefeated.

273
00:28:06,064 --> 00:28:09,985
And Walnut Heights is ranked
third in the state.

274
00:28:11,487 --> 00:28:16,575
They have a swim team, a tennis team.
They got golf for boys and girls!

275
00:28:17,409 --> 00:28:21,330
But they don't have
a football team like we've got.

276
00:28:21,997 --> 00:28:26,210
And they don't have a
student body like we have!

277
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:31,089
I've gotta talk to you.
What?

278
00:28:31,256 --> 00:28:33,926
I've gotta talk to you.

279
00:28:41,099 --> 00:28:42,851
Tracy's pregnant.

280
00:28:43,769 --> 00:28:47,564
- What?
- Tracy's pregnant. I took her to the doctor.

281
00:28:47,731 --> 00:28:51,318
We are gonna beat
Walnut Heights because we're Ampipe.

282
00:28:51,526 --> 00:28:57,115
And this Ampipe football team
can't lose! They're gonna win!

283
00:28:59,409 --> 00:29:03,205
Well, how does she feel
about an abortion?

284
00:29:03,288 --> 00:29:06,041
You know Tracy, not real good.

285
00:29:07,793 --> 00:29:10,128
You dumb bastard.

286
00:29:11,004 --> 00:29:15,759
What are you gonna do?
You gonna have the kid? Huh?

287
00:29:20,555 --> 00:29:23,600
What am I supposed to do, Stef?

288
00:29:23,767 --> 00:29:30,065
Captain, quarterback,
team leader, Clarence Oliver, Rifleman.

289
00:29:30,273 --> 00:29:35,445
What you do is you talk
to your recruiter at SC, okay?

290
00:29:35,612 --> 00:29:40,325
I've heard about stuff like this.
They can work things out for you-

291
00:29:40,492 --> 00:29:45,080
- I'm having a kid.
- Look, we're getting out of here, Brian.

292
00:29:45,914 --> 00:29:47,791
Right?

293
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:51,920
I proudly introduce
defensive captain and linebacker...

294
00:29:52,087 --> 00:29:54,798
Right, Bri? Bri?

295
00:29:54,965 --> 00:29:57,551
...Brian Riley!

296
00:30:12,315 --> 00:30:17,738
This is the biggest game of our lives.
We've worked hard.

297
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:23,326
We no longer want to win.
We have to win.

298
00:30:23,493 --> 00:30:26,538
And we're gonna. We're gonna win.

299
00:30:29,249 --> 00:30:34,546
Not just for us, but for you too.
Thanks a lot.

300
00:32:35,583 --> 00:32:37,419
Jeez, look at the place.

301
00:32:39,838 --> 00:32:44,050
Now this is what a real locker room
looks like.

302
00:33:27,385 --> 00:33:30,138
- Tank, you take my tape roll?
Fuck it.

303
00:33:30,305 --> 00:33:33,016
Did you take my tape roll, huh?

304
00:33:33,183 --> 00:33:34,893
Did you take it?

305
00:33:35,059 --> 00:33:39,314
Cut it out, man! Save it for the field, Vucci.

306
00:34:04,464 --> 00:34:06,257
Let's go, fellas.

307
00:34:06,424 --> 00:34:09,052
That's everybody.

308
00:34:10,303 --> 00:34:13,681
Let me have it over here.
Right here, let's have it.

309
00:34:19,896 --> 00:34:22,232
Settle down.

310
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:37,247
Gentlemen.

311
00:34:38,498 --> 00:34:40,083
Here's the situation.

312
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:43,753
We haven't beaten Walnut Heights
in my five years as coach.

313
00:34:43,962 --> 00:34:48,049
There are people out there
who don't think you're gonna do it.

314
00:34:48,967 --> 00:34:52,053
But there's 37 people
in this room who can.

315
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,471
Yes, sir!
- Right?

316
00:34:53,638 --> 00:34:55,807
Yes, sir!

317
00:34:55,974 --> 00:34:58,643
That's you, and that's me.

318
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:01,563
Why are we so sure?
What do we know?

319
00:35:01,729 --> 00:35:05,858
I don't think they know about
the pain you're willing to endure.

320
00:35:06,067 --> 00:35:07,443
- Do they, Tank?
- No.

321
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:11,072
Or how hard you hit.
- No, sir.

322
00:35:11,281 --> 00:35:14,742
- Or what you'll do to Alexander.
- No, sir!

323
00:35:14,909 --> 00:35:18,830
- They don't know about Rifleman's arm.
- No, sir.

324
00:35:19,038 --> 00:35:24,836
In 48 minutes they're gonna find out who
you are. You're gonna make me proud.

325
00:35:25,044 --> 00:35:30,800
You guys are gonna achieve some great
successes. And I hope and pray you do.

326
00:35:30,967 --> 00:35:36,097
There's seldom gonna be a moment like
tonight when you hold it all in your hands.

327
00:35:36,306 --> 00:35:40,435
You can achieve something together
they can never take away.

328
00:35:40,643 --> 00:35:45,648
Your friends, your family,
your parents, your school, this town.

329
00:35:45,815 --> 00:35:49,819
A win tonight is gonna give them
something to be proud of.

330
00:35:50,278 --> 00:35:54,991
You know what they call us? You know
why they only gave us 500 tickets?

331
00:35:55,158 --> 00:35:59,162
We're the dagos, we're the Polacks,
we're the niggers!

332
00:35:59,329 --> 00:36:02,957
That's what you are. That's what I am.
That's what we are.

333
00:36:03,124 --> 00:36:06,252
That's how we're gonna
win this game, together!

334
00:36:06,461 --> 00:36:07,837
- How?
- Together!

335
00:36:08,004 --> 00:36:09,172
- How?
- Together!

336
00:36:09,338 --> 00:36:10,631
- We'll do it!
- Together!

337
00:36:10,798 --> 00:36:12,216
- How?
- Together!

338
00:36:12,425 --> 00:36:15,887
We're gonna win together!
Come on down!

339
00:36:20,558 --> 00:36:24,437
Now taking
the fiield the Ampipe Bulldogs.

340
00:36:27,857 --> 00:36:30,443
And here come your Knights!

341
00:36:46,876 --> 00:36:50,046
Ampipe kicks off.

342
00:36:50,254 --> 00:36:53,508
And the game is under way!

343
00:36:59,138 --> 00:37:01,516
Come on! Get tough!

344
00:37:04,894 --> 00:37:08,940
- Six-two stack monster. Ready!
Break!

345
00:37:09,315 --> 00:37:12,527
- All right, fellows, this is it!
Break!

346
00:37:13,361 --> 00:37:15,780
Full house! Full house!

347
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:20,117
- I'm coming after your ass, Riley!
- Do it. Make me happy!

348
00:37:35,466 --> 00:37:39,095
Way to go, way to go, all right.
- Way to go, LaRue.

349
00:37:39,637 --> 00:37:43,641
Bellow, come here.
Why can't we block those little turkeys?

350
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:47,019
- They're cutting my knees.
- I don't want to hear that.

351
00:37:47,186 --> 00:37:49,772
Block them anyway. Now let's do it.

352
00:38:07,415 --> 00:38:11,085
That's the end
of the fiirst quarter. No score.

353
00:38:11,294 --> 00:38:12,503
Break!

354
00:38:12,712 --> 00:38:14,005
Break!

355
00:38:23,681 --> 00:38:26,475
Ready, set!

356
00:38:26,642 --> 00:38:28,769
Hut! Hut!

357
00:38:32,398 --> 00:38:35,860
Alexander's in the clear.

358
00:38:36,527 --> 00:38:38,863
Touchdown!

359
00:38:39,405 --> 00:38:42,366
And the Knights take the lead!

360
00:38:54,628 --> 00:38:58,299
Ampipe's ball 2:48 left in the half.

361
00:39:19,695 --> 00:39:23,532
Ampipe touchdown
by number 19 Austin Williams.

362
00:39:25,951 --> 00:39:28,245
Yeah. All right!

363
00:39:40,091 --> 00:39:46,764
Walnut Heights leads 10-7
with 3:47 left in the game.

364
00:40:05,825 --> 00:40:08,327
We did it! We did it!
- Yeah!

365
00:40:08,536 --> 00:40:10,746
Stefen!

366
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,874
In your face Walnut High! In your face!

367
00:40:14,041 --> 00:40:20,673
Ampipe touchdown
by number 33 Stefen Djordjevic.

368
00:40:34,979 --> 00:40:41,527
Ampipe leads 14-10
with 3:12 left in the game.

369
00:40:56,333 --> 00:41:00,796
Alexander for 17
and a fiirst down on the Ampipe 42.

370
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:10,097
Hold that line!

371
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:19,732
Great catch by Alexander down to the 29!

372
00:41:28,115 --> 00:41:29,783
Out of bounds on the 10.

373
00:41:29,992 --> 00:41:33,203
- First and goal for the Knights.
That's my man.

374
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:35,539
Ready. Set.

375
00:41:46,008 --> 00:41:51,055
Pass interference. The Knights have
the ball on the Ampipe fiive-yard line.

376
00:41:51,221 --> 00:41:53,974
You got a boy
playing for Walnut Heights?

377
00:41:54,141 --> 00:41:57,561
You hit too soon. It's your penalty.
Interference.

378
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:59,313
- It's the same play from practice.
- Shit!

379
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,522
It's the same play!

380
00:42:00,731 --> 00:42:04,234
- Blind bastard!
Good hit! It was a good hit!

381
00:42:04,401 --> 00:42:07,780
It was a good hit!
You're damn right. Come on.

382
00:42:09,031 --> 00:42:15,162
Okay, we're holding them. Now keep up
goal line D, goal line D! Ready! Break!

383
00:42:15,621 --> 00:42:18,665
Third and goal for the Knights
on the three.

384
00:42:22,544 --> 00:42:25,422
Ready! Set! Hut-hut!

385
00:42:29,551 --> 00:42:34,264
- Hold them! Come on!
Yeah! Yeah! All right!

386
00:42:35,682 --> 00:42:37,101
Fight, damn it, fight!

387
00:42:37,976 --> 00:42:42,689
Fourth and goal for the Knights
on the one-yard line! This is it!

388
00:42:48,028 --> 00:42:54,284
Ready! Set!
- Hold them! You fucking bastards!

389
00:43:04,128 --> 00:43:07,548
Alexander is stopped short
of the goal line!

390
00:43:10,259 --> 00:43:15,389
Ampipe takes over on their own one-
yard line with 12 seconds left.

391
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:23,480
- We did it, Riley!
Did we do it?

392
00:43:23,647 --> 00:43:25,107
You did it!

393
00:43:26,483 --> 00:43:27,860
Rifleman!

394
00:43:28,068 --> 00:43:30,612
- Coach!
- I strong right, 42 condition.

395
00:43:30,779 --> 00:43:32,406
All right!

396
00:43:52,301 --> 00:43:56,513
Salvucci fumbles in
the end zone and the Knights recover.

397
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:02,269
It's a touchdown! No time left. Knights
win! Touchdown. The Knights win!

398
00:45:30,148 --> 00:45:35,028
Come on, Salvucci.
Let's hear a good cry, all right.

399
00:45:35,195 --> 00:45:40,367
All I'm hearing is a whimper. Let's
hear a cry! I want to hear a good one.

400
00:45:41,034 --> 00:45:46,915
You choked! You cost us the game.
You quit on me and on this team.

401
00:45:47,416 --> 00:45:49,876
He didn't quit.

402
00:45:52,045 --> 00:45:54,089
What did you say?

403
00:45:57,217 --> 00:46:02,013
Well, Salvucci, he didn't quit.
None of us quit.

404
00:46:03,849 --> 00:46:08,770
I don't know. We beat those guys'
asses up and down that field tonight!

405
00:46:10,397 --> 00:46:15,110
We got nothing to be ashamed of, right?
Isn't that right?

406
00:46:15,318 --> 00:46:20,740
You know, maybe the scoreboard
doesn't say it, but we won that game.

407
00:46:23,952 --> 00:46:25,829
We held them.

408
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:32,085
It was just a fluke.
That's all, it's just a fluke.

409
00:46:32,252 --> 00:46:34,087
A fluke?

410
00:46:35,005 --> 00:46:39,301
That pass interference penalty,
that was no fluke.

411
00:46:39,968 --> 00:46:42,971
If you had done it the way
I taught you...

412
00:46:43,138 --> 00:46:47,893
...they never would've been down there
and scored and we would've won!

413
00:46:48,852 --> 00:46:51,813
You're just as responsible as he is.

414
00:46:56,151 --> 00:47:01,823
If you'd have had Rifleman hold
on to the ball, then we would've won.

415
00:47:02,032 --> 00:47:04,200
We didn't quit, you quit!

416
00:47:05,619 --> 00:47:10,582
Get your stuff and you get the hell
out of here right now.

417
00:47:11,166 --> 00:47:12,834
What?

418
00:47:14,044 --> 00:47:18,924
You heard me. You get out of here.
You're through. You're off the team.

419
00:47:48,536 --> 00:47:52,540
I'll see you, I gotta get on the bus.
All right.

420
00:47:52,874 --> 00:47:56,378
- Yeah, that's him. Right there.
Wait up.

421
00:47:59,422 --> 00:48:02,676
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Where you going?

422
00:48:02,884 --> 00:48:05,553
- On the bus.
No, this is the wrong bus.

423
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:09,391
This is for players.
You ride with the cheerleaders.

424
00:48:17,565 --> 00:48:21,319
- Stef? Stef? Okay.
- Hey, Lisa, don't talk to me now.

425
00:48:21,486 --> 00:48:24,239
- I want to be left alone.
- You were good.

426
00:48:24,406 --> 00:48:26,866
Just leave me alone!

427
00:48:46,428 --> 00:48:52,350
Why didn't Nickerson take
the safety and then punt it out of there?

428
00:48:52,517 --> 00:48:57,397
Because he's an asshole. We're never
gonna beat those rich pricks.

429
00:48:57,564 --> 00:49:02,861
Not as long as he's coach we won't.
- Maybe that won't be for too long.

430
00:49:05,738 --> 00:49:08,324
Goddamn it, it's true.

431
00:49:08,491 --> 00:49:12,704
He's kicked off for disciplinary
reasons. What does that mean?

432
00:49:12,871 --> 00:49:16,207
- His big mouth got him in trouble.
- What'd he say?

433
00:49:16,374 --> 00:49:18,877
He knew this would ruin his chances.

434
00:49:19,043 --> 00:49:24,507
Word gets around he has a bad attitude,
he'll be lucky if he gets any offers.

435
00:49:24,674 --> 00:49:27,427
I can't believe he meant it.
Everybody's-

436
00:49:27,594 --> 00:49:29,929
Your kid cost us the game.

437
00:49:33,683 --> 00:49:35,602
Oh! Hot damn!

438
00:49:35,768 --> 00:49:38,980
I'm gonna go home and wait
for your brother.

439
00:49:39,147 --> 00:49:42,567
Because whatever he said,
he'll have to apologize.

440
00:49:42,734 --> 00:49:45,403
Sure, Pop. Sure.

441
00:49:47,071 --> 00:49:49,157
Goddamn!

442
00:50:08,134 --> 00:50:09,719
Hey! Hey!

443
00:50:10,011 --> 00:50:14,015
Hey, Stefie, come on in.
All right.

444
00:51:15,159 --> 00:51:18,037
Suzie?
Uh-huh?

445
00:51:18,204 --> 00:51:20,581
I should've had Rifleman
fall on the ball.

446
00:51:22,458 --> 00:51:26,879
Please, Vern,
you're driving yourself crazy.

447
00:51:27,046 --> 00:51:32,093
Daddy, there's a man playing
on the lawn, and he waked me up.

448
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:35,346
Honey, you get in bed with Mommy,
okay?

449
00:51:44,021 --> 00:51:45,690
Hey.

450
00:51:46,858 --> 00:51:49,777
Bosko.
What the hell are you guys doing?

451
00:51:49,986 --> 00:51:53,281
What do you think?
- Isn't this a little crazy?

452
00:51:53,448 --> 00:51:56,033
You gonna do something about it?

453
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,312
Bastards.

454
00:52:38,075 --> 00:52:39,535
Hey, Stef!

455
00:52:39,952 --> 00:52:42,079
- Hey.
- How you doing?

456
00:52:42,246 --> 00:52:46,125
- You going to talk to the coach?
- Yeah. Wish me luck.

457
00:52:46,292 --> 00:52:49,253
- Want me to go with you?
- No.

458
00:52:49,462 --> 00:52:50,963
You sure?

459
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:54,800
- Okay, good luck, pal.
- All right.

460
00:52:56,219 --> 00:52:57,678
Hey.

461
00:52:58,804 --> 00:53:01,599
- How you doing, man?
- How you doing?

462
00:53:15,613 --> 00:53:17,406
Coach Nickerson.

463
00:53:21,953 --> 00:53:27,458
I'd just like to say I'm sorry about
what I said. I didn't mean anything.

464
00:53:28,709 --> 00:53:33,673
And, well, Friday, it's our last game,
it's at home, and I'm a senior.

465
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:37,718
I'd really like to play,
and it means a lot to me.

466
00:53:37,885 --> 00:53:43,224
And I feel really bad
about what happened.

467
00:53:43,391 --> 00:53:47,103
I was hoping maybe you'd take me
back on the team.

468
00:53:47,645 --> 00:53:48,938
I'm sorry.

469
00:53:51,983 --> 00:53:53,651
So what?

470
00:53:56,904 --> 00:53:59,281
Real forgiving, aren't you?

471
00:54:02,034 --> 00:54:04,829
You were at the house, and I saw you.

472
00:54:04,996 --> 00:54:08,165
The best thing you can do
is get out of here.

473
00:54:08,791 --> 00:54:13,546
I can explain. They picked me up.
I just dumped garbage on your lawn.

474
00:54:13,713 --> 00:54:15,631
- I tried to stop them!
- No.

475
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:19,260
You dumped garbage on me,
my wife, my little girl.

476
00:54:19,427 --> 00:54:21,178
- I'm sorry.
- Now leave me alone.

477
00:54:21,345 --> 00:54:25,057
What about the game?

478
00:54:25,516 --> 00:54:28,602
I mean, this is the last game.

479
00:54:29,395 --> 00:54:31,272
Please.

480
00:54:32,148 --> 00:54:34,483
You've played your last game.

481
00:54:44,243 --> 00:54:47,329
Coach, you are really fucked, man!

482
00:54:48,122 --> 00:54:51,125
No, son. You are.

483
00:55:02,887 --> 00:55:04,346
Lisa!

484
00:55:07,016 --> 00:55:12,980
How about it, Lis? I was at
band practice today watching you.

485
00:55:13,147 --> 00:55:17,067
- You're real good.
- Yeah, I saw you there, Stef.

486
00:55:18,277 --> 00:55:23,157
Maybe I'll join the band to spend
more time with you. How's that sound?

487
00:55:23,324 --> 00:55:26,494
It sounds like Nickerson
didn't take you back.

488
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:31,499
Screw Nickerson. I've got the grades,
the talent. I'll get my scholarship.

489
00:55:31,665 --> 00:55:35,961
You'll get your football scholarship,
I'll get nothing.

490
00:55:36,128 --> 00:55:38,172
What are you talking about?

491
00:55:39,465 --> 00:55:44,887
Asshole jocks who can't spell their
names get scholarships and I can't.

492
00:55:45,054 --> 00:55:46,931
Asshole jocks?

493
00:55:47,389 --> 00:55:52,061
An asshole who'd scream at his
girlfriend who he says he loves...

494
00:55:52,228 --> 00:55:54,605
...in front of a busload of people.

495
00:55:54,772 --> 00:55:58,150
- I don't need to be treated like that!
- Wait, Lisa.

496
00:55:58,317 --> 00:56:02,071
I apologize. A lot was going on.
You don't understand.

497
00:56:02,238 --> 00:56:05,366
I don't understand?
You don't understand!

498
00:56:05,908 --> 00:56:10,496
I want to go to college and study
music. But we can't afford it.

499
00:56:10,663 --> 00:56:15,793
Nobody in Ampipe gets a music
scholarship, just football scholarships!

500
00:56:16,335 --> 00:56:18,754
So I'll be a grocery clerk.

501
00:56:22,341 --> 00:56:29,014
I'm stuck here, Stef. I haven't even
got a chance. I'm 17 years old.

502
00:56:29,556 --> 00:56:32,184
It's not fucking fair.

503
00:56:32,643 --> 00:56:37,648
And, you, you're so selfish,
you don't even see it.

504
00:56:42,403 --> 00:56:47,324
- God, I've been such an asshole, huh?
- Yes.

505
00:56:48,784 --> 00:56:50,244
Yeah.

506
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:54,665
I can spell my own name, though.

507
00:56:55,916 --> 00:56:59,878
No, Lis, I mean, I don't know what-

508
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:08,178
I'm really sorry.
What can I do to make it up to you?

509
00:57:08,345 --> 00:57:10,431
Just be my friend.

510
00:57:13,225 --> 00:57:15,185
I can do that.

511
00:57:17,021 --> 00:57:18,856
I need you, Lis.

512
00:57:19,023 --> 00:57:24,611
I need you too sometimes, you know?
You gotta be there for me.

513
00:57:26,488 --> 00:57:30,367
Okay, I will. I promise.

514
00:57:31,035 --> 00:57:33,996
I promise. I'm sorry.

515
00:57:35,539 --> 00:57:41,920
I'm sorry. I promise I won't pressure
you about what happened last week.

516
00:57:42,087 --> 00:57:47,551
You know, sex and all that stuff.
It's stupid, and, I'm sorry.

517
00:57:47,718 --> 00:57:49,553
Yeah, you will.

518
00:57:51,805 --> 00:57:53,807
How do you know that?

519
00:57:56,560 --> 00:58:00,606
You're so gorgeous,
I just can't help it. That's why.

520
00:58:02,232 --> 00:58:08,447
I love you so much, Lisa.
I'm sorry. I just mess up.

521
00:58:13,327 --> 00:58:15,788
Now I get to carry this, huh?

522
00:58:16,371 --> 00:58:18,165
Come on!

523
00:58:19,082 --> 00:58:24,963
I don't need to graduate, I need a job.
My uncle and brother are out of work.

524
00:58:25,172 --> 00:58:29,384
You quit school, you'll be on the
streets. How will that help?

525
00:58:29,593 --> 00:58:33,263
Let me make some calls.
Before you make a decision.

526
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:35,599
Hey, Nick, how's it going?

527
00:58:35,766 --> 00:58:38,352
Sherm, how are you?
- Nice to see you.

528
00:58:38,519 --> 00:58:40,687
Vinnie,
Sherm Williams, Boston College.

529
00:58:40,854 --> 00:58:44,483
I've heard good things.
Everything okay?

530
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:47,319
- That time of year again?
- Playing Pitt.

531
00:58:47,486 --> 00:58:49,530
- I understand, you-
- Hold it.

532
00:58:49,696 --> 00:58:53,367
- Vinnie. I know you're no quitter.
- What?

533
00:58:53,575 --> 00:58:57,287
- Don't quit on me, man.
- Right, coach.

534
00:58:57,454 --> 00:59:00,082
Hey, nice to meet you.

535
00:59:00,249 --> 00:59:04,628
I understand you had a hell
of a defense against Walnut Heights.

536
00:59:04,795 --> 00:59:08,298
I want to see film on Riley,
Djordjevic and Oliver.

537
00:59:08,465 --> 00:59:12,928
Riley and Oliver, they're good.
Djordjevic, I got to pass on.

538
00:59:13,095 --> 00:59:16,765
- Why? That kid's tough.
- He's got an attitude problem.

539
00:59:16,932 --> 00:59:21,270
- I cut him from the team.
- That must have been a tough decision.

540
00:59:23,897 --> 00:59:25,774
Yeah, it was tough.

541
00:59:29,194 --> 00:59:32,906
How about it, Greg?
How about what, Stef?

542
00:59:35,742 --> 00:59:38,161
I don't know. How you doing?

543
00:59:39,454 --> 00:59:42,499
- You want to use the car tonight?
- What?

544
00:59:42,666 --> 00:59:45,585
Just drop me off at the Carpatho.

545
00:59:46,878 --> 00:59:51,758
- You're not going to go to the game?
- No, I'm going to go get drunk.

546
00:59:57,973 --> 01:00:04,146
I got laid off today.
Me and 700 others.

547
01:00:05,605 --> 01:00:11,737
- What are you going to do?
- I told you. I'm gonna get shit-faced.

548
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:14,114
I mean, after that.

549
01:00:15,824 --> 01:00:17,492
I don't know.

550
01:00:18,535 --> 01:00:20,412
I'm real sorry.

551
01:01:31,608 --> 01:01:35,695
- Aren't you supposed to be at the game?
- I hate football.

552
01:01:35,862 --> 01:01:40,367
I just like to watch number
33 run around in those tight pants.

553
01:01:41,326 --> 01:01:45,080
It's pretty cold out here.
You want to go upstairs?

554
01:01:45,247 --> 01:01:46,832
I'll beat you!

555
01:01:51,378 --> 01:01:54,965
- What were you doing up here?
- Just drawing.

556
01:01:55,590 --> 01:02:02,180
- Then show me.
- You want to see? Step into my office.

557
01:02:07,727 --> 01:02:09,688
Did you do all these?

558
01:02:10,313 --> 01:02:16,653
Yeah. This is what I've been playing
football for, for the past 10 years.

559
01:02:17,112 --> 01:02:18,488
What's that one?

560
01:02:18,655 --> 01:02:24,160
That's my undersea dome. It's just
one of the first things I ever did.

561
01:02:24,327 --> 01:02:25,870
It's good.

562
01:02:26,788 --> 01:02:30,542
- Where's your dad?
- He's at work.

563
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:38,300
- And Greg?
- Carpatho.

564
01:02:39,092 --> 01:02:43,847
- Are we alone?
- Yeah. I could call someone.

565
01:02:44,681 --> 01:02:46,141
No.

566
01:02:48,685 --> 01:02:52,272
Why don't you take your coat off
and stay a while?

567
01:02:52,814 --> 01:02:55,191
That would be nice, wouldn't it?

568
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:14,627
- You got that right over your bed.
- Yeah. Remember that night?

569
01:03:20,008 --> 01:03:23,595
I've got a funny outfit to show you.

570
01:03:42,572 --> 01:03:44,449
It's cute.

571
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:38,938
I love you.

572
01:05:40,315 --> 01:05:42,442
I love you too, Lis.

573
01:06:12,096 --> 01:06:15,224
You hear from Syracuse or
any other school?

574
01:06:15,391 --> 01:06:16,768
No.

575
01:06:17,185 --> 01:06:20,480
Pretty soon it'll be
letter-of-intent day.

576
01:06:20,647 --> 01:06:23,441
The last school I saw
was Walnut Heights.

577
01:06:23,608 --> 01:06:26,486
- How about it, Vin?
- Fuck school, man.

578
01:06:26,652 --> 01:06:28,821
Fuck Christmas.

579
01:07:09,487 --> 01:07:12,323
Hi, Miss Malevik.
- How are you?

580
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:17,453
- All right. Do I get a kiss?
Where are you going?

581
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:19,205
Don't ask.
- Pittsburgh.

582
01:07:19,372 --> 01:07:22,500
- See the Penguins and Flyers.
Aren't we lucky?

583
01:07:22,667 --> 01:07:24,252
- Can I come?
- I'm surprised you're not.

584
01:07:24,418 --> 01:07:25,461
No. You don't go.

585
01:07:25,628 --> 01:07:28,464
- He's only kidding.
- Honeymoon, they go alone.

586
01:07:28,631 --> 01:07:31,384
- That settles that.
Will you carry this?

587
01:07:31,551 --> 01:07:33,845
Bye, Miss Malevik.
Goodbye.

588
01:07:36,347 --> 01:07:40,518
- How you doing?
- All right. How are you doing?

589
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:42,687
Big day.

590
01:07:43,604 --> 01:07:46,315
I heard Nickerson got
that coaching job.

591
01:07:46,482 --> 01:07:50,611
Yeah. Apparently the guy
in Aliquippa got a better offer.

592
01:07:50,778 --> 01:07:54,991
A toast. To the bride, the groom...

593
01:07:55,158 --> 01:07:59,620
...and the baby. May it be a boy.
Na zdrowie.

594
01:08:02,123 --> 01:08:03,541
Thanks.

595
01:08:09,213 --> 01:08:12,049
- What do you think of this?
- I know.

596
01:08:13,301 --> 01:08:16,804
Tracy always wanted a big wedding
with a long gown.

597
01:08:16,971 --> 01:08:19,390
Every girl does, I guess.

598
01:08:19,932 --> 01:08:23,185
Like we wanted to play
for the Steelers, huh?

599
01:08:28,357 --> 01:08:31,569
- I'll give you a hand with this stuff.
- Yeah.

600
01:08:52,256 --> 01:08:56,385
Should we be spending
U.S. tax dollars in Guatemala-?

601
01:08:56,552 --> 01:08:59,847
Excuse me, Miss Dudukovich.
- Yes, sir.

602
01:09:00,306 --> 01:09:02,808
- Yes, I do.
- She doesn't.

603
01:09:05,186 --> 01:09:07,855
Police officer. You're under arrest.

604
01:09:16,864 --> 01:09:19,116
All right. Come on!

605
01:09:26,916 --> 01:09:30,378
- Hold it! Where are you taking him?
To jail.

606
01:09:30,544 --> 01:09:32,296
- What for?
Armed robbery.

607
01:09:32,463 --> 01:09:34,882
Help me, coach!

608
01:09:35,257 --> 01:09:37,677
Hey! Help me, coach!

609
01:09:40,304 --> 01:09:43,140
Come on, what are you, chicken?

610
01:09:45,643 --> 01:09:47,353
Hold it.

611
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:51,690
- Babe, I want you to wait here, okay?
- No way, Stef. Come on.

612
01:09:57,655 --> 01:10:00,408
Hey, Henry, can I have another Iron?

613
01:10:01,158 --> 01:10:03,160
- How about it, Mr. Bosko?!
- Mr. Bosko.

614
01:10:03,369 --> 01:10:04,995
Hey, Stef. Lisa Lietzke.

615
01:10:05,204 --> 01:10:10,251
- What can I do for you?
- Mr. Bosko, I have a real problem.

616
01:10:10,418 --> 01:10:14,797
Nickerson is blackballing me
because of the stuff at his house.

617
01:10:14,964 --> 01:10:18,342
I was hoping you'd tell him what
really happened.

618
01:10:18,509 --> 01:10:20,344
What really happened?

619
01:10:20,761 --> 01:10:23,347
No college will even touch me now.

620
01:10:23,514 --> 01:10:28,894
- Come on, Bosko, the whole town knows.
- Knows what? That I was there?

621
01:10:29,061 --> 01:10:34,150
Hey. Was I at Nickerson's house?
Did I trash it? Were you there?

622
01:10:34,316 --> 01:10:36,444
Were any of you there?

623
01:10:39,155 --> 01:10:43,868
- Please. You gotta help me.
- I don't gotta do anything.

624
01:10:44,743 --> 01:10:48,372
I don't plan on spending
the rest of my life here.

625
01:10:48,539 --> 01:10:52,084
Now, you can't even get a job in
that goddamn mill!

626
01:10:52,251 --> 01:10:56,130
That goddamn mill.
Is that your problem, Stef?

627
01:10:56,297 --> 01:11:00,467
Hey, fellas. Stef's got a problem
with the goddamn mill.

628
01:11:00,634 --> 01:11:03,721
Where your father works?
Where your brother works?

629
01:11:03,888 --> 01:11:05,556
My brother was laid off.

630
01:11:05,723 --> 01:11:09,852
Where my father worked and all
who made this town what it is?

631
01:11:10,019 --> 01:11:11,854
You mean, what it was.

632
01:11:14,815 --> 01:11:17,026
You too good for us or something?

633
01:11:17,985 --> 01:11:20,863
No, sir. I just want to go to college.

634
01:11:23,115 --> 01:11:27,828
Stef. Is that what's the matter, Stef?

635
01:11:28,787 --> 01:11:33,459
- You getting tired of Polack pussy?
- You son of a bitch!

636
01:11:37,504 --> 01:11:41,258
All right. Enough. Enough! Enough!
I said enough!

637
01:11:46,347 --> 01:11:47,932
Bosko.

638
01:11:54,355 --> 01:11:58,859
Hey, Djordjevic,
we'll see you around, okay?

639
01:12:32,559 --> 01:12:35,854
- Yes?
- Mrs. Nickerson, my name is Lisa Lietzke.

640
01:12:36,021 --> 01:12:38,190
Can I talk to you for a moment?

641
01:12:39,441 --> 01:12:44,196
Please believe me. I know Stef,
and he'd never try to hurt anyone.

642
01:12:45,656 --> 01:12:49,368
He's a kid. He wants to go to college
and be something.

643
01:12:49,535 --> 01:12:52,121
And your husband's stopping him.

644
01:12:52,705 --> 01:12:56,709
You know, someone happens to bow out,
or a spot opens up...

645
01:12:56,875 --> 01:13:01,004
...I would appreciate it if you could
keep me in mind.

646
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:02,923
Yes, sir.

647
01:13:03,757 --> 01:13:07,594
Okay. Thank you for your time.

648
01:13:07,803 --> 01:13:12,891
- What would you do? Would you go?
- I'm a junior. I have a year left.

649
01:13:13,058 --> 01:13:15,227
What about after you graduate?

650
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:21,608
You know, if he leaves here
you'll probably lose him.

651
01:13:21,775 --> 01:13:24,069
I have to let him go. I love him.

652
01:13:24,278 --> 01:13:29,366
I was in love in high school. We were
gonna get married after graduation.

653
01:13:29,533 --> 01:13:33,871
The Army took him. I went to
North Carolina State and met Vern.

654
01:13:35,747 --> 01:13:38,000
What do you want to do, Lisa?

655
01:13:38,792 --> 01:13:41,211
I want to study music.

656
01:13:41,879 --> 01:13:43,672
Then do it.

657
01:13:45,048 --> 01:13:48,719
- What happened to that high school boy?
- Tommy?

658
01:13:48,886 --> 01:13:53,891
I guess he's in Parkersburg. I haven't
thought about him in 100 years.

659
01:13:55,225 --> 01:13:58,770
- God, I loved him.
- No more than I love Stef.

660
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:20,375
Well, yes, sir, I realize it's a little
late, but I've been very busy.

661
01:14:20,542 --> 01:14:23,545
You know, I was
meaning to call you sooner.

662
01:14:26,173 --> 01:14:29,301
Mr. Smith, you said
I could count on you.

663
01:14:34,598 --> 01:14:37,726
I understand. Okay.

664
01:14:39,102 --> 01:14:40,562
Thanks anyway.

665
01:14:58,038 --> 01:15:00,040
Drink some of this.

666
01:15:07,255 --> 01:15:10,133
Are you ashamed of me, Papa?

667
01:15:10,801 --> 01:15:13,845
What are you talking about?
That's crazy.

668
01:15:14,846 --> 01:15:18,809
You're my son. I love you.
Why would I be ashamed of you?

669
01:15:19,434 --> 01:15:24,648
I don't know. I must have done
something wrong for this to happen.

670
01:15:25,482 --> 01:15:29,361
You've done nothing wrong, Stefen.
You're a good boy.

671
01:15:29,820 --> 01:15:33,865
I love you. We love you.

672
01:15:35,367 --> 01:15:38,161
Your mother was always proud of you.

673
01:15:39,663 --> 01:15:41,665
I know you're hurt.

674
01:15:43,041 --> 01:15:45,919
It's okay. I understand.

675
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:51,717
- I love you and I'm proud of you.
- I'm sorry.

676
01:15:51,883 --> 01:15:54,970
I was never prouder of you
than right now.

677
01:16:16,575 --> 01:16:19,202
- You got it.
You got it, bro.

678
01:16:21,288 --> 01:16:22,789
Drink.

679
01:16:24,708 --> 01:16:27,419
- How's it going, man?
That's for luck.

680
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:31,923
Hey, can I have your attention?
Everybody.

681
01:16:32,132 --> 01:16:37,012
I'd like to toast a friend who couldn't
be with us. To Vinnie Salvucci.

682
01:16:37,179 --> 01:16:39,264
- To the Vucc.
To Vucc.

683
01:17:03,538 --> 01:17:05,165
What's it going to be?

684
01:17:05,332 --> 01:17:06,416
- Girl.
- A boy.

685
01:17:26,228 --> 01:17:29,814
I'm going to West Virginia.
To West Virginia!

686
01:17:30,023 --> 01:17:33,276
Good for him.
He wanted to go to West Virginia.

687
01:17:33,443 --> 01:17:36,821
- Shadow. Here's to West Virginia.
- Here's to it.

688
01:17:37,572 --> 01:17:44,204
- And SC, right, Brian?
- Stef, man. I'm going to have a kid.

689
01:17:45,747 --> 01:17:47,916
That's more important than college.

690
01:17:49,668 --> 01:17:54,422
I got what I want.
I really got what I wanted.

691
01:18:05,267 --> 01:18:07,060
How you doing, Trace?

692
01:18:07,227 --> 01:18:10,939
You're the 18th person that's
touched my stomach.

693
01:18:15,652 --> 01:18:19,322
- Job? What job?
- Greg got on with a demolition company.

694
01:18:19,489 --> 01:18:22,701
He pulled a few strings and got me
weekend work.

695
01:18:22,909 --> 01:18:25,829
- Doing what?
- You know that blast furnace...

696
01:18:25,996 --> 01:18:30,458
...down at Franklin and Seven?
Tearing that piece of shit apart.

697
01:18:30,625 --> 01:18:34,879
My father worked there 14, 15 years.

698
01:18:35,922 --> 01:18:40,093
Then on the fifth day, thank you, God,
he created cheerleaders.

699
01:18:40,301 --> 01:18:43,430
- Amen.
- And commanded that they wear skirts...

700
01:18:43,596 --> 01:18:46,182
...and do cartwheels,
and that was very good!

701
01:18:46,349 --> 01:18:50,353
Great.
- I mean, that was pretty good.

702
01:18:50,603 --> 01:18:55,775
And on the sixth day,
he created the football player.

703
01:18:55,942 --> 01:19:00,822
And fans paid money
to watch them hurt.

704
01:19:01,698 --> 01:19:05,952
And that was good. On the seventh day...

705
01:19:08,830 --> 01:19:11,332
...they all played football.

706
01:19:11,499 --> 01:19:16,671
Six-two stack monster.
Six-two stack monster. Ready, hut!

707
01:19:38,401 --> 01:19:41,362
- He's over there on the counter.
- I know.

708
01:20:03,885 --> 01:20:07,347
Mrs. Nickerson, excuse me.

709
01:20:09,098 --> 01:20:15,021
I want to tell you I know it's late
and I have to say this for my own sake.

710
01:20:15,188 --> 01:20:18,900
I was there the night your house
got messed up.

711
01:20:19,108 --> 01:20:23,112
And I'm sorry it happened.

712
01:20:34,958 --> 01:20:36,834
Hey, Djordjevic!

713
01:20:39,337 --> 01:20:42,423
Djordjevic, I'd like to talk to you.

714
01:20:42,590 --> 01:20:45,134
We got nothing to talk about.

715
01:20:45,885 --> 01:20:47,387
Where are you going?

716
01:20:47,553 --> 01:20:48,846
- Where am I going?
- Yeah.

717
01:20:51,015 --> 01:20:53,142
No place, man.

718
01:20:53,393 --> 01:20:57,981
Shadow, he's going to West Virginia.
He just found out tonight.

719
01:20:58,147 --> 01:21:02,277
Tank's going to Furman, you knew that.
You're going to Cal Poly.

720
01:21:02,777 --> 01:21:04,779
Mouse...

721
01:21:05,989 --> 01:21:08,574
Mouse is going to college.
He's gonna play ball.

722
01:21:10,743 --> 01:21:14,831
Me, I'm just gonna hang out here.
I don't know. You know.

723
01:21:16,791 --> 01:21:22,755
Hey, Nickerson. You lied about me.
You blackballed me.

724
01:21:24,507 --> 01:21:29,178
Together, remember that?
Together, together, together.

725
01:21:29,387 --> 01:21:32,098
That was always just bullshit.

726
01:21:32,515 --> 01:21:35,393
- What?
- You're full of shit, man.

727
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:41,691
You sit in your office, scholarship,
no scholarship. He goes, he stays.

728
01:21:42,567 --> 01:21:46,446
Who in the hell gave you that power?

729
01:21:46,654 --> 01:21:49,991
You're just a coach.
A high school football coach.

730
01:21:51,159 --> 01:21:52,869
I mean...

731
01:21:55,705 --> 01:21:57,832
I don't know.

732
01:22:08,134 --> 01:22:09,802
You know...

733
01:22:11,512 --> 01:22:16,976
...Nickerson, you are not God!

734
01:22:17,602 --> 01:22:21,731
You are just a typing teacher.

735
01:24:11,048 --> 01:24:13,050
- Mr. Djordjevic.
- Hello, Lisa.

736
01:24:13,217 --> 01:24:15,469
- Hi, Greg.
- Hey, Lisa.

737
01:24:21,309 --> 01:24:23,561
It's so good to see you.

738
01:24:24,854 --> 01:24:29,108
- You've been working hard.
- What have you been up to?

739
01:24:31,402 --> 01:24:34,572
- What's he doing here?
He's been looking for you.

740
01:24:34,739 --> 01:24:39,410
I brought him here.
Listen, why don't you just talk to him?

741
01:24:47,668 --> 01:24:49,420
Just talk to him, huh?

742
01:24:49,587 --> 01:24:51,630
Hi, Joe.
Hello. How are you?

743
01:24:52,089 --> 01:24:53,799
Hi, Greg.
Coach.

744
01:24:53,966 --> 01:24:56,844
How are you feeling?
- Okay.

745
01:24:58,512 --> 01:25:00,306
Djordjevic.

746
01:25:02,808 --> 01:25:06,353
I've come here to apologize.
I wanted to tell you...

747
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:10,900
...that I'm sorry about what I did.
You know, and I was wrong.

748
01:25:11,692 --> 01:25:13,527
I'm sorry.

749
01:25:15,404 --> 01:25:21,786
I'd like you to come play football
for me at Cal Poly on this scholarship.

750
01:25:23,579 --> 01:25:28,292
- You wanna run that by me again?
- I want you to play football for me.

751
01:25:30,294 --> 01:25:33,506
- You're just doing this to feel better.
- I am.

752
01:25:33,672 --> 01:25:37,843
You're damn right.
I feel a hell of a lot better right now.

753
01:25:38,928 --> 01:25:40,596
Full scholarship, huh?

754
01:25:40,763 --> 01:25:45,810
Yeah. At one of the finest engineering
schools in the country. So sign it.

755
01:25:47,812 --> 01:25:52,483
Come on, Stef. Just sign it.
I love you. I want you to. Just sign it.

756
01:25:52,650 --> 01:25:54,777
What about you, Lis? Huh?

757
01:25:55,736 --> 01:25:56,862
Sign it.
