1
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,135
Because the world is round

2
00:00:14,238 --> 00:00:19,540
It turns me on

3
00:00:23,548 --> 00:00:29,180
Because the world

4
00:00:29,287 --> 00:00:34,554
Is round

5
00:00:37,562 --> 00:00:41,692
Ah

6
00:00:45,236 --> 00:00:50,003
Because the wind is high

7
00:00:50,074 --> 00:00:55,876
It blows my mind

8
00:00:59,917 --> 00:01:05,378
Because the wind

9
00:01:05,456 --> 00:01:09,916
Is high

10
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,961
Ah

11
00:01:16,033 --> 00:01:19,799
Love is old, love is new

12
00:01:22,073 --> 00:01:25,702
Love is all, love is you

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,074
Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

14
00:01:38,156 --> 00:01:40,317
I was really involved
at the beginning

15
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:44,191
because I nurtured a dream
about a project with George.

16
00:01:44,262 --> 00:01:48,562
For him, this project was
not only doing a show,

17
00:01:48,633 --> 00:01:54,333
but it was also an opportunity to maybe
have the Beatles members left alive

18
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:57,374
working together
on a creative project again.

19
00:02:00,511 --> 00:02:04,880
(McCartney) I was introduced
originally to the Cirque by my daughter

20
00:02:04,949 --> 00:02:08,817
when she took me to a show
in the Albert Hall in London.

21
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,718
And then George and Olivia

22
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:16,249
took me to see "O"
in Las Vegas.

23
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,660
George, because he was friends,
I think, with Guy,

24
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:26,601
started talking about a collaboration
between the Cirque and the Beatles.

25
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:28,935
There was the possibility
that Cirque

26
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,137
wanted to use Cirque's interpretation
of Beatles music

27
00:02:34,245 --> 00:02:39,273
with possibly musicians on stage
just like, you know, normal Cirque shows.

28
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:43,480
And I said,
"No, it's got to be the Beatles' music."

29
00:02:58,903 --> 00:03:01,030
The brief that I was given was:

30
00:03:01,105 --> 00:03:03,835
"You've got to have
90 minutes of music

31
00:03:03,908 --> 00:03:09,676
and you create that from anything you
recorded with the Beatles since 1962."

32
00:03:09,747 --> 00:03:11,738
(drum intro)

33
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:20,714
(Starr) George knew
where all the bodies were.

34
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:24,921
"That bass line that wasn't used,
we can put that there. There's a drum..."

35
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:28,898
There was talk of,
like, some new, hip guy,

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,525
which sounds all very nice
for a minute.

37
00:03:31,636 --> 00:03:36,630
But, you know, suddenly the new, hip guy
is... There's another new, hip guy.

38
00:03:36,707 --> 00:03:40,700
So we got George Martin,
who's always been hip.

39
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:43,873
Baby, you can drive my car

40
00:03:43,948 --> 00:03:45,779
And maybe I'll love you

41
00:03:45,883 --> 00:03:49,284
(George Martin) I've lived with
these songs for 40-odd years.

42
00:03:49,353 --> 00:03:51,844
It's great to listen to.

43
00:03:51,956 --> 00:03:54,049
(man) I started, with my father,

44
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:57,355
started working on this
two years ago.

45
00:03:58,896 --> 00:04:03,424
I suppose when I started doing it, I was
full of fear, loathing and dread, thinking:

46
00:04:03,501 --> 00:04:08,871
"God, I've been given a Beatles tape
and they want me to do something to it

47
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,467
and people are going to
hate me for this."

48
00:04:18,015 --> 00:04:20,006
It's a good retrospective song.

49
00:04:20,117 --> 00:04:22,984
(George Martin) We've been
running around in circles.

50
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:27,923
OK. All I've got...
I've got nothing left.

51
00:04:27,992 --> 00:04:29,323
Oh

52
00:04:29,393 --> 00:04:31,691
Oh, yeah

53
00:04:31,796 --> 00:04:33,229
Oh

54
00:04:33,297 --> 00:04:35,959
Oh, yeah

55
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,335
(man) I felt like un imposteur.
How do you say? The syndrome of the...

56
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:43,600
- (man) Impostor.
- Impostor.

57
00:04:43,674 --> 00:04:46,302
Who am I to be there,

58
00:04:47,311 --> 00:04:49,905
sitting in studio 2
with George Martin

59
00:04:49,981 --> 00:04:53,678
and dreaming of which tracks,

60
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:56,948
which music
we would play with?

61
00:04:57,021 --> 00:05:01,424
(George Martin) But also we're
changing the actual tracks themselves.

62
00:05:01,525 --> 00:05:04,358
And this is a tightrope of taste
that we're walking

63
00:05:04,428 --> 00:05:07,397
because once you start
tampering with Beatle material,

64
00:05:07,465 --> 00:05:10,332
you're tampering with
the Holy Grail.

65
00:05:10,434 --> 00:05:12,425
It's like, sort of,
if I went in

66
00:05:12,503 --> 00:05:15,495
and we overlaid guitars
to make things sound more rocky,

67
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,767
people would go
completely bonkers.

68
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:21,367
I'd find out my house
had been burnt down.

69
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:26,280
(Champagne) Like yesterday,
visiting all of those places

70
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:29,751
and signs of that mythology...
We went to Liverpool yesterday.

71
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,811
Some other guy, now

72
00:05:31,922 --> 00:05:35,323
Is taking my love away from me,
oh, now...

73
00:05:35,393 --> 00:05:40,558
- (Champagne) I feel like a pilgrim.
- (George Martin) You're Scousers now.

74
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:43,327
(Champagne) So I feel
really excited, actually.

75
00:05:43,434 --> 00:05:45,629
Delighted, excited,

76
00:05:45,703 --> 00:05:49,139
honored and panicked.

77
00:05:51,442 --> 00:05:55,071
I was told in the very beginning
that this was going to be,

78
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:58,912
or this was already,
an impossible show.

79
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:02,146
And this is what I deal with
from day one.

80
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,019
Get back

81
00:06:05,122 --> 00:06:08,922
Get back
to where you once belonged

82
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,551
Get back

83
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,622
Get back

84
00:06:12,697 --> 00:06:16,827
Get back
to where you once belonged

85
00:06:18,402 --> 00:06:20,461
Get back, Jo

86
00:06:22,807 --> 00:06:25,970
(Champagne) Honestly,
I was very, very nervous,

87
00:06:26,077 --> 00:06:30,138
thinking that,
from the time that they broke up,

88
00:06:31,148 --> 00:06:34,481
the world is hoping
for a comeback.

89
00:06:34,552 --> 00:06:36,281
Oh, get back

90
00:06:36,353 --> 00:06:38,412
Get back

91
00:06:38,522 --> 00:06:41,582
Get back
to where you once belonged

92
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:54,003
(Champagne) You've got to go
straight to your final destination, OK?

93
00:06:54,071 --> 00:06:56,904
Don't do the whole path.

94
00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:04,671
OK, number two, go.

95
00:07:04,749 --> 00:07:08,742
(man) I play Sergeant Pepper.
Sergeant Pepper is the band leader.

96
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:11,845
At this stage of the creation,

97
00:07:11,956 --> 00:07:14,652
I would say
he's more on paper.

98
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:19,093
I guess I'm a mix, maybe,
of George Martin, in a certain way,

99
00:07:19,196 --> 00:07:22,222
and Dominic told me also
that Sergeant Pepper, for him,

100
00:07:22,299 --> 00:07:24,699
represents the father
of Paul McCartney

101
00:07:24,802 --> 00:07:28,101
because he played
the trumpet in a band.

102
00:07:29,807 --> 00:07:31,297
(shouts)

103
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:36,012
Instead of just dully telling
the Beatles' story:

104
00:07:36,113 --> 00:07:39,742
"It started here and ended there,
and that was this, this and that,"

105
00:07:39,817 --> 00:07:44,345
I tried to touch
the main emotions

106
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:47,151
that went throughout
their experience,

107
00:07:47,224 --> 00:07:50,489
building this show
as a rock-'n'-roll poem.

108
00:07:50,594 --> 00:07:53,461
("Eleanor Rigby"
by the Beatles)

109
00:08:02,306 --> 00:08:03,864
It is cold!

110
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:08,139
I'm from Johannesburg.
I'm from the east side of Johannesburg,

111
00:08:08,245 --> 00:08:10,941
which is called Katlehong.

112
00:08:11,482 --> 00:08:15,316
They chose me
for one of the characters,

113
00:08:15,386 --> 00:08:17,820
you know,
for the Beatles' music.

114
00:08:17,922 --> 00:08:23,189
And at that time I didn't even
know about the Beatles and all that.

115
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:28,220
Like, "I don't know about those people,
so I'll know everything when I get here."

116
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,699
He just arrived just now.

117
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,429
Nice to meet you.
Welcome. We were worried.

118
00:08:33,504 --> 00:08:37,838
We were not hoping anymore, actually.
I'm really glad you're here.

119
00:08:37,908 --> 00:08:41,275
So it's going to be a cultural shock
for you, but welcome aboard.

120
00:08:41,345 --> 00:08:44,678
We're going to take care of you.
Thank you for being here.

121
00:08:45,115 --> 00:08:47,811
Evelyne, you play with Hassan.

122
00:08:49,753 --> 00:08:53,348
Hassan, tu fais un geste
et tu stoppes.

123
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:57,055
Crab a locker fishwife,
pornographic priestess

124
00:08:57,161 --> 00:09:01,825
Boy, you've been a naughty girl,
you let your knickers down

125
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:04,834
I am the eggman

126
00:09:04,902 --> 00:09:07,462
They are the eggmen

127
00:09:07,538 --> 00:09:10,974
I am the walrus,
goo goo g'joob

128
00:09:11,075 --> 00:09:15,341
(Champagne) OK, stop.
Now, can I have everyone sing:

129
00:09:15,446 --> 00:09:19,473
"Oompah, oompah,
everybody's got one,

130
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,849
oompah, oompah,
stick it up your jumper"?

131
00:09:22,953 --> 00:09:25,183
OK, so, stand by.

132
00:09:25,256 --> 00:09:26,746
Three, four...

133
00:09:26,824 --> 00:09:29,554
(all chant) Oompah, oompah,
everybody's got one.

134
00:09:29,627 --> 00:09:33,222
Oompah, oompah, stick it up your jumper.
Oompah...

135
00:09:33,297 --> 00:09:36,164
("I Am the Walrus")

136
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,939
(Champagne) And keep,
keep, keep, keep...

137
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,169
OK, give your upper body
a little bit more...

138
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:49,712
Can you imagine?
We're the first company

139
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:54,979
that, in 35 years, has been able to make
a deal - a business deal - with the Beatles.

140
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:57,987
We're partners with the Beatles.
This is big.

141
00:09:59,523 --> 00:10:01,718
The Beatles,
with the name they have,

142
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:04,784
and us, who never give away
creative control, it was...

143
00:10:04,862 --> 00:10:10,323
How could you find,
you know, creative consensus?

144
00:10:11,335 --> 00:10:16,034
Well, partnerships are difficult. If you've
ever been married, you know that.

145
00:10:16,106 --> 00:10:21,703
But partnerships where there's more than
two people are even more complicated.

146
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:23,713
Exponentially.

147
00:10:23,781 --> 00:10:27,808
Cirque has a done a lot of business
with our company, MGM Mirage,

148
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:30,751
and it's been
a two-part partnership.

149
00:10:30,821 --> 00:10:34,917
LOVE is unique
because we have a third partner,

150
00:10:34,992 --> 00:10:39,452
which is the Apple Group
that represents, of course, the Beatles.

151
00:10:40,464 --> 00:10:45,629
One of the things about the Beatles
and the shareholders now,

152
00:10:45,703 --> 00:10:50,299
it's sort of like
an inverted democracy, right?

153
00:10:50,374 --> 00:10:53,673
That if one person doesn't want
to do something, we don't do it.

154
00:10:53,744 --> 00:10:56,736
It's not like
three can overrule one.

155
00:10:57,514 --> 00:10:59,675
Thank you.

156
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:04,813
This is something George wanted
to happen from the minute he met Guy.

157
00:11:04,922 --> 00:11:08,323
So, for me, this is really
emotional and important.

158
00:11:08,392 --> 00:11:13,659
And I know that he's on one of those
bungee wires up there somewhere.

159
00:11:15,199 --> 00:11:18,600
Ladies and gentlemen,
I just want to thank George

160
00:11:18,669 --> 00:11:21,467
because he's the one
who discovered you for us.

161
00:11:21,538 --> 00:11:25,372
And thank you
for doing this, Olivia.

162
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:34,376
We lost George and George's input
into the show, and that's a...

163
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,919
that's a great loss.

164
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:42,118
It made people more determined
to see the project through,

165
00:11:42,192 --> 00:11:46,424
you know,
and make it work and, uh...

166
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:49,898
We would have done that anyway
if George had been alive.

167
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,492
It just made us all
more determined to do it for George.

168
00:11:53,604 --> 00:11:57,040
I think so.
It did me, anyway.

169
00:11:57,107 --> 00:11:59,769
Here comes the sun

170
00:12:00,978 --> 00:12:04,436
Here comes the sun
and I say

171
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,176
It's all right

172
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,710
Little darling

173
00:12:11,789 --> 00:12:16,556
It's been a long cold
lonely winter

174
00:12:17,594 --> 00:12:19,255
Little darling

175
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:23,527
It feels like years
since it's been here

176
00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:26,502
Here comes the sun

177
00:12:26,603 --> 00:12:28,798
(Starr) I've always loved Cirque.

178
00:12:28,872 --> 00:12:32,433
God knows -
it's 10, 12 years I've seen it,

179
00:12:32,509 --> 00:12:35,069
when it was in a tent
in Santa Monica in LA.

180
00:12:35,145 --> 00:12:40,742
So I had no problem with
the Cirque du Soleil attitude,

181
00:12:40,818 --> 00:12:44,618
'cause it's like this fantasy world,
which I loved.

182
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:48,456
Found my coat
and grabbed my hat

183
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,926
Made the bus
in seconds flat

184
00:12:52,963 --> 00:12:56,023
Found my way upstairs
and had a smoke

185
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,001
Somebody spoke
and I went into a dream

186
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,661
Ah

187
00:13:00,737 --> 00:13:06,369
We've always liked to associate ourselves
with slightly crazy people

188
00:13:06,477 --> 00:13:08,536
'cause we're slightly crazy.

189
00:13:08,645 --> 00:13:10,806
Artists are slightly crazy, you know.

190
00:13:10,914 --> 00:13:13,508
So to work with the Cirque,

191
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,849
we're drawing on
that same attraction.

192
00:13:16,954 --> 00:13:19,047
("Back in the USSR")

193
00:13:19,156 --> 00:13:22,216
Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC

194
00:13:22,326 --> 00:13:25,420
Didn't get to bed last night

195
00:13:25,496 --> 00:13:28,863
On the way
the paper bag was on my knee

196
00:13:28,966 --> 00:13:30,991
Man, I had a dreadful flight

197
00:13:31,068 --> 00:13:33,059
I'm back in the USSR

198
00:13:34,905 --> 00:13:39,774
I met Dominic, actually,
from the inception of this idea,

199
00:13:39,877 --> 00:13:44,746
and I thought he understood
John's songs, especially, very well.

200
00:13:44,815 --> 00:13:47,978
("I Am the Walrus")

201
00:13:49,153 --> 00:13:51,951
It's not so much that
John's character's personified -

202
00:13:52,022 --> 00:13:58,257
I don't think that they're doing that so
much as to really express the songs well.

203
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:03,900
Help me get my feet
back on the ground

204
00:14:04,001 --> 00:14:07,493
Won't you please,
please help me?

205
00:14:07,604 --> 00:14:12,371
Help me, help me, ooh

206
00:14:16,213 --> 00:14:17,737
Eleanor Rigby

207
00:14:17,814 --> 00:14:21,807
Picks up the rice in the church
where a wedding has been

208
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,179
Lives in a dream

209
00:14:25,255 --> 00:14:27,348
(Olivia Harrison) When I went to watch,

210
00:14:27,424 --> 00:14:30,916
to have a visual imagination
was really difficult for me

211
00:14:30,994 --> 00:14:35,693
'cause I kept thinking, "That doesn't look
right. What are they gonna do there?"

212
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:39,826
And they'd say, "No. That's not going
to be there. The stage is going to come up

213
00:14:39,903 --> 00:14:42,428
and they'll be gone
and that will be dark."

214
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:47,910
So that was actually
a whole new experience for me.

215
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:51,508
And also, you know,
you have your concept about a song.

216
00:14:51,582 --> 00:14:56,281
"Eleanor Rigby" to you might be
something and it might be different to me.

217
00:14:56,353 --> 00:15:00,949
And that's the beauty of music.
You know, the vision of it is in your head.

218
00:15:01,024 --> 00:15:05,154
("While My Guitar Gently Weeps")

219
00:15:08,632 --> 00:15:11,999
I look at you all

220
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:16,062
See the love there
that's sleeping

221
00:15:17,107 --> 00:15:19,632
While my guitar

222
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,645
Gently weeps

223
00:15:24,314 --> 00:15:28,512
I feel strongly about the two characters
from the beginning of the show,

224
00:15:28,585 --> 00:15:32,988
that, you know,
we have to let go of that at some point.

225
00:15:33,056 --> 00:15:38,653
These characters will be emotionally
very charged at this point of the show.

226
00:15:38,762 --> 00:15:41,697
- Can I speak freely?
- Yeah.

227
00:15:41,798 --> 00:15:46,258
Yeah, I don't particularly
like those characters.

228
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:49,669
- And I don't know if it's, you know...
- You know what?

229
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:54,643
I'll tell you what. In the beginning he was
in it too much, if you know what I mean.

230
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:57,111
(PA) This is a short pause.

231
00:15:58,215 --> 00:16:00,342
If we count
all the titles that we have,

232
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:04,717
we have 14 John, 13 Paul,
four George and one Ringo.

233
00:16:04,788 --> 00:16:06,756
- But you know what?
- So?

234
00:16:06,823 --> 00:16:12,193
What I'm saying is we're concerned about
trying to respect a balance in between...

235
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:17,700
Yeah, but, you know, you use John
for the early-day ones, and here comes...

236
00:16:17,801 --> 00:16:22,067
This is the time
that they were the best, and so...

237
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:27,076
And, anyway, it's not just about that.
It's about what makes you feel the best.

238
00:16:27,144 --> 00:16:30,011
Hey, Jude

239
00:16:30,113 --> 00:16:33,674
Don't make it bad

240
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,548
Take a sad song

241
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,317
And make it better

242
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:45,623
Remember
to let her into your heart

243
00:16:45,696 --> 00:16:48,358
Then you can start

244
00:16:48,432 --> 00:16:51,458
To make it better

245
00:16:51,535 --> 00:16:53,526
Uh...

246
00:16:58,742 --> 00:17:05,079
I would say first
that I was given a lot of freedom

247
00:17:05,148 --> 00:17:08,015
to write and direct this show

248
00:17:08,118 --> 00:17:10,416
by the Beatles.

249
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:14,117
And I really appreciated that,

250
00:17:14,191 --> 00:17:18,890
knowing that
the balance in between them

251
00:17:18,995 --> 00:17:21,759
is a very fragile one.

252
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:25,825
If you have a school photograph
and everybody's clustering around,

253
00:17:25,902 --> 00:17:31,863
the first thing is, "Where am I?" You don't
look for your friend, you look for yourself.

254
00:17:31,942 --> 00:17:35,673
So that if Paul
is listening to a mix of a song,

255
00:17:35,746 --> 00:17:38,943
he's going to listen to himself.
And the same with Ringo.

256
00:17:39,015 --> 00:17:41,279
And Olivia and Yoko
do the same thing.

257
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:46,983
They are, in a way, looking after their
own territory, perhaps with more care.

258
00:17:47,057 --> 00:17:49,821
Of course they're looking at
the broad elements too.

259
00:17:49,926 --> 00:17:55,455
But you have to juggle with that and sort
of make sure that everybody is satisfied,

260
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:58,865
that we have
a consensus of approval.

261
00:17:58,935 --> 00:18:01,495
Hey, Jude

262
00:18:01,605 --> 00:18:04,665
Na na na

263
00:18:04,741 --> 00:18:06,902
Na na na na

264
00:18:08,078 --> 00:18:10,444
Na na na na

265
00:18:10,514 --> 00:18:13,176
Hey, Jude

266
00:18:14,217 --> 00:18:17,653
Na na na

267
00:18:17,754 --> 00:18:20,222
Na na na na

268
00:18:24,628 --> 00:18:26,789
(cheering and applause)

269
00:18:28,765 --> 00:18:33,429
My background is theater.
In England, I'm an actor.

270
00:18:33,503 --> 00:18:36,495
You come to
an environment like this,

271
00:18:36,606 --> 00:18:39,473
which is incredibly challenging
for an artist

272
00:18:39,543 --> 00:18:43,570
because of the nature of the company
and the shows it does.

273
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,410
It's very much
like a factory as well.

274
00:18:46,516 --> 00:18:48,984
I'm not used to big productions.

275
00:18:49,052 --> 00:18:52,818
I'm used to, like, people that I know,
people that I understand

276
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:57,292
and doing the same things and all that,
you know, so it's quite...

277
00:18:57,394 --> 00:19:01,160
It is hard because you're trying to
work through not just interpreters,

278
00:19:01,231 --> 00:19:04,428
but coaches as well
and assistant directors.

279
00:19:04,501 --> 00:19:10,064
You're at the bottom of the food chain,
trying to get through so many people

280
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,837
to articulate what you're trying to say
or your concepts.

281
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:19,542
Also, in the show itself, there's a director
and eight or nine different coaches...

282
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:24,644
See you in Vegas. Forget the snow.
It's over. Forget the snow. It's over.

283
00:19:24,754 --> 00:19:27,723
The devil lives here
for a South African.

284
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:31,022
- Take care of yourself. Have a safe trip.
- God bless.

285
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:46,169
You'd think that you couldn't go wrong
with Cirque and the Beatles,

286
00:19:46,276 --> 00:19:48,836
and I hope that's true.

287
00:19:48,912 --> 00:19:52,609
But risk in the entertainment business

288
00:19:52,716 --> 00:19:56,618
is just about as scary
as risk in a poker game -

289
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,813
there are no sure bets.

290
00:19:59,589 --> 00:20:03,787
The aggregated investment
in the Beatles show is...

291
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,455
approaches $180 million.

292
00:20:09,266 --> 00:20:13,703
As long as it's empty, it costs me about
$5 million a month, so I'm incentivized

293
00:20:13,803 --> 00:20:17,295
to get the show room
up and running.

294
00:20:17,874 --> 00:20:23,972
Everything was on fast-track - to do all the
negotiations with Cirque, Mirage, Apple,

295
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,878
and do the storyboards
and build the theater.

296
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:32,411
All that was happening at the same time,
so it was pretty frenetic at times.

297
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,649
Still is, actually.

298
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,993
(Hudson) My reaction was, "I know
where we are now and the world we're in."

299
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,429
And that's
the most important thing to me.

300
00:20:42,499 --> 00:20:46,868
For the first time, it went, "Oh,
it'll be nice to come to work tomorrow."

301
00:20:46,937 --> 00:20:50,930
"It'll be nice to come in and say,
'I see what you want. That makes sense."'

302
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:56,741
Because we've had five months of
not knowing how to navigate through this.

303
00:20:56,813 --> 00:21:00,340
I think we're going to be able to see
all the characters

304
00:21:00,417 --> 00:21:04,615
and we're going to sense the emotion
on stage because it's very intimate.

305
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,780
So I think
this is a very good thing.

306
00:21:07,991 --> 00:21:10,391
(Champagne) Welcome to the casino.

307
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,759
I'm very happy about
the intimacy of the theater.

308
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:17,322
It's a room
good for actors and characters,

309
00:21:17,434 --> 00:21:24,067
much more than other,
let's say, big, impressive scenery,

310
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:27,701
but where the human being
is, like, very small

311
00:21:27,777 --> 00:21:30,007
or part of a machine.

312
00:21:30,113 --> 00:21:34,607
And that leads me to what I think
should be one of your challenges

313
00:21:34,718 --> 00:21:37,619
and state of mind
for this creation -

314
00:21:37,721 --> 00:21:40,212
what we would call
"showmanship."

315
00:21:40,323 --> 00:21:42,621
OK. Sometimes it happens, OK?

316
00:21:42,692 --> 00:21:46,150
The trap is open,
but we need the stage to be closed

317
00:21:46,229 --> 00:21:49,756
and it's not working
and you're all alone on stage.

318
00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:54,494
I want you not to leave, not to escape,
but to stay there

319
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:59,701
and to make this show
as good as it was one minute ago

320
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:02,040
up until the light turns green.

321
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,876
- Did you ever stop "O"?
- (man) Many times.

322
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:08,679
- Many times?
- You have to go on stage and improvise.

323
00:22:08,752 --> 00:22:11,744
Sometimes it takes time,
like 10 minutes or 15 minutes.

324
00:22:11,821 --> 00:22:15,655
You're doing, and suddenly there's
a green light and the show continues.

325
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:20,253
- OK, you go on stage and you improvise.
- (Hudson) That's the best way, I think.

326
00:22:20,363 --> 00:22:22,524
(Champagne) "OK, let's play with it."

327
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:27,433
That's the first reaction you have to have,
so this is why I insist on that.

328
00:22:27,504 --> 00:22:30,735
"We're panicking now.
Let's have fun. Let's play with that."

329
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,831
"We have nothing to lose somehow."

330
00:22:32,909 --> 00:22:35,571
Yeah, OK.
So save the show.

331
00:22:50,593 --> 00:22:54,085
I don't think he's like that,
as piggy as that.

332
00:22:54,197 --> 00:22:57,098
I think he has to save...

333
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,330
- He has to keep some control. Exactly.
- Right. OK.

334
00:23:01,438 --> 00:23:05,966
It's... I don't know, because now
we're working with professional people

335
00:23:06,076 --> 00:23:08,874
who have learnt things
from the school and all that.

336
00:23:08,945 --> 00:23:12,472
Because with me and what you call
pantsula and gumboots dance,

337
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:15,916
I've never been to school for that.
I learnt it from the streets -

338
00:23:15,985 --> 00:23:18,818
from the streets of South Africa,
from Johannesburg.

339
00:23:18,922 --> 00:23:22,255
So I'm learning from them as well

340
00:23:22,358 --> 00:23:25,953
and there's small things
that I can pick up

341
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:28,998
and then make use of them.

342
00:23:35,004 --> 00:23:38,701
(Champagne) OK, so how many times...
We have 10 minutes?

343
00:23:38,775 --> 00:23:42,506
Well, we could work on
"Lady Madonna". No?

344
00:23:42,579 --> 00:23:47,414
Just show me. I just want to see you
performing together, face to face.

345
00:23:47,517 --> 00:23:50,145
("Lady Madonna")

346
00:23:51,955 --> 00:23:55,356
(Moloi) Working with Natasha,
it's a different thing

347
00:23:55,425 --> 00:23:58,883
because I've only
worked with guys.

348
00:23:58,995 --> 00:24:03,193
And I was even... The first time,
I was even scared to touch her

349
00:24:03,266 --> 00:24:07,498
because I'm not used to
working with ladies.

350
00:24:10,373 --> 00:24:15,504
I'm not just dancing because I know
the style, the routine, but I'm giving.

351
00:24:15,578 --> 00:24:18,411
I want to make people happy,
at the end of the day.

352
00:24:18,515 --> 00:24:23,851
I want to sit down here and know
that people are happy, you know.

353
00:24:23,953 --> 00:24:26,012
Baby at your breast

354
00:24:26,122 --> 00:24:31,617
Wonder how you manage
to feed the rest

355
00:24:35,999 --> 00:24:38,991
("Lady Madonna" continues)

356
00:24:39,068 --> 00:24:42,333
Tuesday afternoon
is never ending

357
00:24:43,339 --> 00:24:46,536
Wednesday morning
papers didn't come

358
00:24:47,577 --> 00:24:52,981
(George Martin) Listening sessions have
been important for analyzing the theater,

359
00:24:53,082 --> 00:24:56,745
which, let's face it,
isn't an ideal place

360
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,913
for putting out music.

361
00:24:58,988 --> 00:25:01,252
We're used to working in a studio

362
00:25:01,357 --> 00:25:04,383
where everything
is geared to a good sound.

363
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:08,556
Now, here we have an auditorium
which is very, very large

364
00:25:08,631 --> 00:25:11,600
and it's oval - almost circular.

365
00:25:11,668 --> 00:25:14,694
And above what you can see,

366
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:18,501
there is as much space
as there is below it.

367
00:25:21,344 --> 00:25:28,113
(Baldwin) We did allow for the most
sophisticated audio system ever devised.

368
00:25:28,184 --> 00:25:32,712
They had to have speakers everywhere.
I had to pay for the speakers, too.

369
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:37,123
They were in the seats and in the seat in
front, and behind your right and left ear.

370
00:25:37,193 --> 00:25:42,495
And they ended up with
several thousands of speakers.

371
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:47,002
And they felt like,
"We have to give them the music

372
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:49,664
as if the Beatles
were in the room performing."

373
00:25:49,739 --> 00:25:51,366
Get back

374
00:25:51,474 --> 00:25:53,567
Get back

375
00:25:53,676 --> 00:25:57,203
Get back
to where you once belonged

376
00:25:57,313 --> 00:25:59,304
Get back

377
00:25:59,382 --> 00:26:03,751
(Proteau) I think it's something
like a historic moment to do this show.

378
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:08,450
All the characters and all the people
in the show, we realize that.

379
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:10,651
But as a stage performer,

380
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:16,756
the way that I will play, the way that
I will approach my character, is the same.

381
00:26:16,833 --> 00:26:20,098
Dominic says, "I remember
that your father is a policeman

382
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:22,603
and I see you
being Sergeant Pepper."

383
00:26:22,672 --> 00:26:27,632
And, strangely, when I tried the uniform,
it was like the photo of my father.

384
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:33,171
So it was very special. And also
because my father is now in a hospital

385
00:26:33,283 --> 00:26:36,741
because he has
Alzheimer's disease.

386
00:26:36,819 --> 00:26:42,553
He doesn't remember me. He cannot say
who I am and that I am his son.

387
00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:45,594
So it touched me greatly.

388
00:26:48,498 --> 00:26:53,094
("Sgt Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band")

389
00:26:57,607 --> 00:27:03,204
(Giles Martin) I'm of a different generation.
I was born in late '69, when they broke up.

390
00:27:03,313 --> 00:27:05,747
Since I was about 17 or 16,

391
00:27:05,815 --> 00:27:09,273
I started working
in studios with him.

392
00:27:09,352 --> 00:27:14,312
And I learnt a lot through the fact
that his hearing was failing,

393
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:17,291
and so he needed
another set of ears.

394
00:27:17,393 --> 00:27:20,487
And that was my training,
and a fantastic honor.

395
00:27:20,596 --> 00:27:23,895
I mean, despite him being my dad,
he is George Martin.

396
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,460
Wednesday morning
and five o'clock

397
00:27:28,538 --> 00:27:31,837
As the day begins

398
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:37,071
Silently closing...

399
00:27:37,146 --> 00:27:40,741
(Giles Martin) It's funny, the studio
he's chairman of has been sold

400
00:27:40,817 --> 00:27:44,583
and he said to me,
"I might take early retirement."

401
00:27:45,855 --> 00:27:49,416
You know,
he's much younger mentally

402
00:27:49,525 --> 00:27:53,461
than a lot of other people
in the music industry,

403
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:57,900
much more keen on innovation,
and this appeals to him, this show.

404
00:27:58,001 --> 00:28:01,459
He may not have the ears he had

405
00:28:01,537 --> 00:28:03,471
and he's old,

406
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:05,632
but he still has the brain.

407
00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:10,168
He never accepts second best.

408
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:13,476
I think that's the best thing for me
with him on this project,

409
00:28:13,549 --> 00:28:17,986
'cause I've had to do lot of chopping
around and a lot of changes.

410
00:28:18,054 --> 00:28:19,715
And...

411
00:28:19,789 --> 00:28:23,247
I know that if he thinks it's good,

412
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:26,021
then it's good.

413
00:28:38,107 --> 00:28:40,132
(musicians tune up)

414
00:28:42,645 --> 00:28:46,012
- (George Martin) Nice to see you again.
- It's nice to see you.

415
00:28:46,115 --> 00:28:49,482
I know.
I never thought I'd be here again.

416
00:28:51,387 --> 00:28:55,983
We wanted to use George Harrison's
song, "While My Guitar Gently Weeps".

417
00:28:56,059 --> 00:28:59,426
And the version
that everybody knows,

418
00:28:59,495 --> 00:29:02,055
which is on the albums,

419
00:29:02,165 --> 00:29:04,326
was going to be used
in the show.

420
00:29:04,434 --> 00:29:10,168
But then Dominic, who has been trawling
through the Anthology all the time,

421
00:29:10,273 --> 00:29:13,333
listened to one of the tracks

422
00:29:13,443 --> 00:29:18,278
where George virtually made a demo,
and he liked this very much.

423
00:29:18,347 --> 00:29:24,445
And I did agree with him. It had a wistful
quality that the master didn't have.

424
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:29,924
(Olivia Harrison) There was a version
that everyone wanted to use except me.

425
00:29:29,992 --> 00:29:34,622
It's really beautiful and intimate,
and I was worried that, um...

426
00:29:34,697 --> 00:29:38,064
it would not sustain
in a big theater.

427
00:29:38,134 --> 00:29:43,367
And it was really Dhani that said,
"No, no, no. They have to use it."

428
00:29:43,473 --> 00:29:47,967
(Giles Martin) So everyone said, "What
can we do?" You know, mixing tracks.

429
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:53,276
And there was nothing that you could take
from another Beatles song.

430
00:29:53,349 --> 00:29:55,579
- Hello, Olivia.
- Hello.

431
00:29:55,685 --> 00:29:58,711
Nice to see you.
Come in.

432
00:29:58,788 --> 00:30:01,655
Actually,
I was really quite nervous about it

433
00:30:01,757 --> 00:30:05,557
because this song
is such a tender song for George

434
00:30:05,628 --> 00:30:07,562
and George isn't with us anymore.

435
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:14,058
And my responsibility in adding music
to this, it weighed very heavily on me.

436
00:30:14,137 --> 00:30:16,935
("While My Guitar Gently Weeps")

437
00:30:54,844 --> 00:30:57,369
While my guitar

438
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,313
Gently weeps

439
00:31:01,684 --> 00:31:05,211
With every mistake

440
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:08,415
We must surely be learning

441
00:31:08,524 --> 00:31:12,585
(Olivia Harrison) I don't think you can
put into words what was George like.

442
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:17,326
You know, he says in some of his songs,
"beware of sadness,"

443
00:31:17,433 --> 00:31:22,496
"all things must pass, " "life goes on
within you and without you."

444
00:31:22,605 --> 00:31:27,633
And that's sort of practical advice
that I have to apply in my life.

445
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,974
He's not here.

446
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:33,879
("While My Guitar Gently Weeps"
continues)

447
00:31:42,124 --> 00:31:44,684
Ah, lovely.

448
00:31:45,228 --> 00:31:46,820
That was great.

449
00:31:46,896 --> 00:31:50,957
The string players,
they realized the significance of...

450
00:31:51,033 --> 00:31:54,298
- It'll be your last string session.
- Yeah, absolutely.

451
00:31:54,403 --> 00:31:57,167
And playing, you know,
a Beatles string session.

452
00:31:57,273 --> 00:32:01,232
And at the end of it,
they gave you a big bouquet of flowers.

453
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:03,972
They gave me two dozen red roses,
the musicians.

454
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,073
Normally they hand out invoices,
so there's a...

455
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:11,347
(George Martin) No,
I was knocked out by that.

456
00:32:27,036 --> 00:32:29,630
(Champagne in French)

457
00:32:33,476 --> 00:32:37,537
How long was this, Armand?
Was it 45 seconds?

458
00:32:37,613 --> 00:32:41,276
("Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!")

459
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,341
(Champagne) A crash
with the machine?

460
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:48,550
(PA) Stand by, please, same place.
We had an automation crash.

461
00:32:52,695 --> 00:32:56,324
(Champagne) Armand, tell us
when you're ready to bring them down.

462
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,633
OK, so we have a couple of events
I would say that we need to prepare for.

463
00:33:00,703 --> 00:33:04,070
On Saturday, as you know,
we have also some visitors from Apple.

464
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:08,907
Paul McCartney will be here. We're going
to do the listening of music with him.

465
00:33:08,978 --> 00:33:12,209
So they will have
a lot of people around this week,

466
00:33:12,315 --> 00:33:15,011
so we just need to get focused
at the same place.

467
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:19,550
- Do you know what you're doing?
- Not yet.

468
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:25,458
Because I'm sure it would be enormously
helpful if you could show Paul

469
00:33:25,561 --> 00:33:30,430
as much of the show visually
as is possible.

470
00:33:31,434 --> 00:33:37,236
Because he hasn't seen it and
he's terribly, intensely curious about it.

471
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:42,710
The thing is that with the machine,
with the state of the process now,

472
00:33:42,778 --> 00:33:45,872
if we launch ourselves
in a complicated act,

473
00:33:45,948 --> 00:33:50,146
it might stop for an hour and a half.
This is where we're at.

474
00:33:50,219 --> 00:33:55,020
Like this afternoon, we worked four hours
and then we were ready to run through,

475
00:33:55,124 --> 00:33:59,788
and we waited 45 minutes because
everything was turned upside down.

476
00:33:59,862 --> 00:34:02,660
(Champagne in French)

477
00:34:02,765 --> 00:34:04,665
(Lalibert)

478
00:34:04,767 --> 00:34:06,792
(Champagne)

479
00:34:15,578 --> 00:34:21,175
We stick on the plan. This is what we do.
We're on a work time frame here.

480
00:34:23,052 --> 00:34:27,853
There's no way we're going back there.
This is staging.

481
00:34:27,957 --> 00:34:32,485
It's not true that we'll expose ourselves
to things that are unfinished

482
00:34:32,595 --> 00:34:36,531
that will create another debate
for two hours and long letters.

483
00:34:36,632 --> 00:34:39,533
Excuse me, but we're past that.

484
00:34:39,635 --> 00:34:42,468
("While My Guitar Gently Weeps")

485
00:34:58,988 --> 00:35:01,923
(man) They're outside.
They just arrived.

486
00:35:01,991 --> 00:35:05,017
- (George Martin) Oh, there's Paul.
- (man) Here he is.

487
00:35:05,094 --> 00:35:09,258
- Mon ami.
- Bonjour! Bonsoir!

488
00:35:09,365 --> 00:35:13,062
Bon afternoon.
Hi. All right.

489
00:35:13,135 --> 00:35:17,037
- You know Dominic.
- Welcome. How are you?

490
00:35:17,106 --> 00:35:20,564
- (McCartney) Good, good.
- We're thrilled to have you here.

491
00:35:20,676 --> 00:35:23,338
Everyone has butterflies
in their stomach.

492
00:35:23,446 --> 00:35:25,471
(McCartney) Good.

493
00:35:25,548 --> 00:35:28,574
I like to keep everyone
in a state of tension.

494
00:35:29,351 --> 00:35:33,412
My only problem was
nobody knew what we were gonna do.

495
00:35:33,522 --> 00:35:36,457
I'd say, "Well, what is the show?"

496
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:39,153
(French accent) "Don't worry.
It's OK. It's OK."

497
00:35:39,228 --> 00:35:42,857
"The Cirque will be good.
The Cirque and the Beatles, very good."

498
00:35:42,965 --> 00:35:45,661
I'm going, "No. No, no."

499
00:35:45,734 --> 00:35:49,226
Then finally they came up with this idea
that the show is based on,

500
00:35:49,305 --> 00:35:53,071
with the ladders,
bringing up the building,

501
00:35:53,142 --> 00:35:55,940
World War II
and Eleanor Rigby coming through.

502
00:35:56,011 --> 00:36:00,107
So, you know, I felt,
"Oh, that's enough. It's all I needed."

503
00:36:00,182 --> 00:36:02,912
Just, "What are you
going to hang the show on?"

504
00:36:02,985 --> 00:36:05,818
(Champagne) Stop. Stop it.

505
00:36:05,921 --> 00:36:08,788
("Get Back")

506
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:17,330
- (Champagne) Stop.
- (woman) We're going to have to stop.

507
00:36:18,901 --> 00:36:21,699
(Champagne in French)

508
00:36:30,513 --> 00:36:32,674
What's new?

509
00:36:34,183 --> 00:36:37,152
It's much taller
than I thought it would be.

510
00:36:37,219 --> 00:36:41,986
I'd like to have a speaker like this. Doing
a concert, you wouldn't have it up there.

511
00:36:42,057 --> 00:36:44,582
- No. That's true.
- So...

512
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:49,029
- But then we wouldn't be in the round.
- That's right.

513
00:36:50,866 --> 00:36:53,391
(cheering)

514
00:36:53,469 --> 00:36:56,632
(McCartney) The only time
we ever were in the round

515
00:36:56,705 --> 00:36:59,674
was our first American gig,
in Washington.

516
00:36:59,742 --> 00:37:03,542
And they stuck us there
and kept asking Ringo to move his kit.

517
00:37:03,646 --> 00:37:07,912
He had to physically move them each
time. I remember, poor Ringo was facing...

518
00:37:07,983 --> 00:37:12,716
We'd never seen the likes of it. They're
saying, "But you've got to do this."

519
00:37:12,788 --> 00:37:15,951
We said, "No!"
They said, "Yeah, there's audience there."

520
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:19,756
We said, "Well, they'll just see our backs."
"No, you've got to move."

521
00:37:19,828 --> 00:37:23,992
So we're moving. Poor old Ringo
picking up his bloody drum kit

522
00:37:24,066 --> 00:37:26,728
and repositioning it
between numbers.

523
00:37:26,835 --> 00:37:30,737
- And then, to make it worse, jelly babies!
- (George Martin) Yeah.

524
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:33,569
- (McCartney) The stage...
- They were thrown at you.

525
00:37:33,676 --> 00:37:36,543
We'd said that our favorite sweet
was jelly babies,

526
00:37:36,645 --> 00:37:40,479
so all the Americans threw them at us -
Bassett's jelly babies.

527
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:44,383
And the whole bloody floor
was like glue.

528
00:37:45,387 --> 00:37:48,982
("I Want to Hold Your Hand")

529
00:37:52,161 --> 00:37:54,493
Oh, yeah, I'll

530
00:37:54,597 --> 00:37:56,758
Tell you something

531
00:37:56,832 --> 00:37:59,801
(Starr) I just loved
the front line of that band.

532
00:37:59,868 --> 00:38:02,359
You know,
John, Paul and George were that band.

533
00:38:02,471 --> 00:38:07,067
And in Liverpool, if they were playing,
it'd be, like, a band I would go and see

534
00:38:07,142 --> 00:38:09,940
if I wasn't playing
in the band I was with.

535
00:38:10,012 --> 00:38:14,745
And then, by chance, there was a knock
on the door at 12 o'clock in the afternoon

536
00:38:14,817 --> 00:38:20,119
and Brian Epstein said, "Would you
play with the Beatles just for today?"

537
00:38:20,189 --> 00:38:23,784
And I did,
and that's how we became friends.

538
00:38:26,862 --> 00:38:30,389
We were just a couple of kids
walking around town in black

539
00:38:30,466 --> 00:38:34,027
with a guitar over our backs,
walking down the streets like that.

540
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,435
So I remember that -
the very beginnings -

541
00:38:36,505 --> 00:38:41,738
or just going to John's house
and learning chords and playing things.

542
00:38:41,844 --> 00:38:46,372
Then it would be, like, in hotel rooms,
and saying, "OK, I've got a bit of an idea."

543
00:38:46,482 --> 00:38:48,541
So you'd fire off each other.

544
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:52,314
And it nearly always took us
about three hours, top.

545
00:38:52,388 --> 00:38:55,414
We never took
any longer than three hours.

546
00:38:55,524 --> 00:38:58,049
And every day we did it,

547
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,027
every single time
we came to do it,

548
00:39:01,096 --> 00:39:03,394
we did it.
We finished a song.

549
00:39:03,465 --> 00:39:08,732
We had a knack for it.
We understood what we were trying to do.

550
00:39:08,837 --> 00:39:10,361
Eleanor Rigby

551
00:39:10,472 --> 00:39:15,535
Died in the church
and was buried along with her name

552
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,202
Nobody came

553
00:39:17,312 --> 00:39:18,939
Father McKenzie

554
00:39:19,014 --> 00:39:24,179
Wiping the dirt from his hands
as he walks from the grave

555
00:39:24,286 --> 00:39:26,117
No one was saved

556
00:39:26,188 --> 00:39:29,123
All the lonely people

557
00:39:29,191 --> 00:39:32,991
Where do they all come from?

558
00:39:33,062 --> 00:39:36,088
All the lonely people

559
00:39:36,198 --> 00:39:39,224
Where do they all belong?

560
00:39:43,105 --> 00:39:45,232
It's strange, isn't it?

561
00:39:46,375 --> 00:39:50,937
But for me,
what's really strange about this is, um...

562
00:39:52,147 --> 00:39:57,585
remembering writing these things,
you know, which was so little -

563
00:39:57,653 --> 00:40:02,955
little guitar, little old piano, bit of paper
and a pencil, the back of an envelope.

564
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:05,289
You know,
"Sergeant Pepper" or something.

565
00:40:05,394 --> 00:40:09,524
So it was such a little process,
and look what's happened to it.

566
00:40:09,631 --> 00:40:11,622
(George Martin) It is amazing.

567
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:24,176
(George Martin) It's very difficult
to escape this heritage that we have.

568
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:30,584
I've been having memories brought back
every day of my life.

569
00:40:31,587 --> 00:40:35,683
There will be a little knot of Beatle fans
somewhere who says:

570
00:40:35,791 --> 00:40:40,160
"They shouldn't do that. They should
leave the masters as we know them."

571
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:44,097
But we're embarking on
a new direction here.

572
00:40:46,668 --> 00:40:50,866
- (Lennon) I'm sorry. I feel useless.
- (Champagne) No noise up there.

573
00:40:50,939 --> 00:40:53,840
It's critical.
No noise there. It'll alter the sound.

574
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:59,006
- (man) We're not going to...
- (Champagne) But McCartney is there.

575
00:40:59,114 --> 00:41:01,708
- (McCartney) Ringo!
- Beep, beep

576
00:41:01,784 --> 00:41:06,016
- (Lennon) Phew! OK, let's go.
- (McCartney) Don't, John. Don't...

577
00:41:06,121 --> 00:41:08,988
(Harrison) Sorry. OK?

578
00:41:09,057 --> 00:41:12,458
- (McCartney) I love that sequence.
- (Champagne) You liked it?

579
00:41:12,561 --> 00:41:14,552
I was playing it safe.

580
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:17,292
I'm glad I came
and said don't be nervous.

581
00:41:17,399 --> 00:41:20,232
It's something to not be nervous about.
It's great.

582
00:41:20,302 --> 00:41:24,170
But I can play you some more
and have your opinion on that.

583
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:26,298
I'm sorry for the rest.
It's like...

584
00:41:26,375 --> 00:41:30,436
It's great. Man, come on.
Hey, come on, man, we understand.

585
00:41:30,512 --> 00:41:32,503
We've been at this a long time too.

586
00:41:33,615 --> 00:41:36,516
So a piano will appear...

587
00:41:36,585 --> 00:41:39,110
(Lennon) Are you ready, Ring?
What should I do now?

588
00:41:39,188 --> 00:41:41,588
- (McCartney) Swing it, man.
- (Lennon) Swing it.

589
00:41:41,657 --> 00:41:43,989
- (McCartney) Let's go.
- (engineer) Take four.

590
00:41:44,059 --> 00:41:49,691
- (McCartney) Hey, Jude, don't...
- (Lennon) Paul, it's very hard to sing this.

591
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:52,892
- (Starr) Do I love you?
- (McCartney) Ringo, stop.

592
00:41:53,001 --> 00:41:57,233
- (Harrison) We'll get that other one.
- (McCartney) Un, deux, trois, quatre.

593
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:59,706
I love the talking,

594
00:41:59,775 --> 00:42:03,871
'cause it put us in that environment,
you know, in the studio,

595
00:42:03,946 --> 00:42:08,076
and the fun we used to have
before we made these records,

596
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,311
which was always
about the music.

597
00:42:10,385 --> 00:42:13,582
But the chatter I loved.
I thought it made it...

598
00:42:13,655 --> 00:42:17,785
It seemed like it could be now,
in a way.

599
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:21,421
I thought they could have
made me a bit taller.

600
00:42:21,496 --> 00:42:25,296
That's the only thing I thought,
"My God, can't I be taller now?"

601
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,868
"Seeing as I'm a shadow."

602
00:42:29,805 --> 00:42:32,433
How did the guys
get together to do a tune right?

603
00:42:32,507 --> 00:42:35,169
You were always
on top of one another like this.

604
00:42:35,277 --> 00:42:40,909
I think that's a good thing. It shows the
humor of recording. We always said...

605
00:42:40,983 --> 00:42:43,281
How could you
put up with them?

606
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:45,820
I'll tell you.
This is what I was going to say.

607
00:42:45,921 --> 00:42:50,153
Because he did Peter Sellers, the Goons...
He did all the comedy records.

608
00:42:50,225 --> 00:42:54,662
My favorite memory of you lot
is when we were doing "Kite"

609
00:42:54,763 --> 00:42:56,754
and I had to do the harmonium.

610
00:42:56,832 --> 00:43:00,666
I became the artist
and you four were the producers.

611
00:43:00,736 --> 00:43:04,866
And you were saying,
"Yeah, another take, please, George."

612
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:08,103
And I was pumping my guts out.

613
00:43:08,176 --> 00:43:11,304
And they were doing it deliberately,
keeping me going.

614
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:15,749
"Just try one more, George.
It's not quite right."

615
00:43:15,817 --> 00:43:18,945
George Martin was like
the grown-up in the group.

616
00:43:19,021 --> 00:43:21,012
George was...

617
00:43:21,123 --> 00:43:24,559
We were like the kids.
In fact, they used to call us "the boys."

618
00:43:24,626 --> 00:43:27,754
That was the working title
of this show, wasn't it?

619
00:43:27,829 --> 00:43:30,992
And we always used to joke,
but we were, like...

620
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:36,060
In the later years, we were, like, 28
and we were still being called "the boys."

621
00:43:36,138 --> 00:43:39,369
We were, like, married with kids
and stuff, "the boys."

622
00:43:39,474 --> 00:43:41,135
But, um...

623
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:43,973
So George Martin was fantastic.

624
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,707
He could do so much.
He could guide us,

625
00:43:46,782 --> 00:43:50,047
he could understand what we were doing,
he could encourage us,

626
00:43:50,152 --> 00:43:54,316
and he could also pick up the
experimental ideas that we threw at him.

627
00:43:54,389 --> 00:43:58,758
I mean, all I had was a bit of tape
and a pair of brass scissors.

628
00:43:58,827 --> 00:44:02,490
And now it's incredible
what the computer power is,

629
00:44:02,597 --> 00:44:07,466
and stretching sounds
and bending them,

630
00:44:07,536 --> 00:44:10,300
putting them in different keys.

631
00:44:10,372 --> 00:44:13,068
It's amazing what you can do.

632
00:44:16,712 --> 00:44:19,203
(McCartney) You work
how you're told to work.

633
00:44:19,314 --> 00:44:21,475
You work with
what technology you have.

634
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:25,247
Now, of course, everyone's got
so much technology, they take forever.

635
00:44:25,354 --> 00:44:29,120
We were told to make four songs a day,
so we did.

636
00:44:29,191 --> 00:44:32,752
Not just ready to mix
some other time,

637
00:44:32,828 --> 00:44:36,889
mixed, finished, ch-ching,
put it up on the shelf. There's "Michelle".

638
00:44:36,999 --> 00:44:42,198
Right, let's do "Nowhere Man".
Ch-ching. Put that up on the shelf.

639
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:45,728
So that meant at the end of the week
you'd done 20 songs.

640
00:44:45,841 --> 00:44:48,935
So, you know,
the early albums, we only did...

641
00:44:49,044 --> 00:44:52,172
It took us, like...
The first album was a day.

642
00:44:52,948 --> 00:44:56,850
- (Giles Martin) I'm pleased he's happy.
- (Champagne) I'm relieved.

643
00:44:56,952 --> 00:44:58,943
I'm relieved.

644
00:44:59,021 --> 00:45:02,752
I'm not sure what I'd do
if he wanted to change the music.

645
00:45:02,824 --> 00:45:05,816
It would rather bugger everyone up,
wouldn't it?

646
00:45:05,894 --> 00:45:10,024
- Now the ball is on my camp.
- (Ste-Croix) You think he will like it?

647
00:45:10,098 --> 00:45:12,931
- You think he will like it?
- Ringo? Of course he will.

648
00:45:13,035 --> 00:45:16,869
Because he's only coming
the day before the premiere.

649
00:45:16,938 --> 00:45:19,930
He cannot come to a session like this.
So to have you...

650
00:45:20,042 --> 00:45:24,706
He'll love it. He's heard this music.
It's just a cool idea.

651
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:27,146
The way you put the sound
is beautiful.

652
00:45:27,215 --> 00:45:29,706
He's never sounded so good.

653
00:45:31,553 --> 00:45:34,613
They mixed 15 minutes
of the music first

654
00:45:34,723 --> 00:45:38,159
and we went to hear it
and I was blown away.

655
00:45:38,226 --> 00:45:41,161
And I just kept saying,
"Make it crazier."

656
00:45:41,229 --> 00:45:43,288
You know, you can...

657
00:45:43,398 --> 00:45:47,664
you can go broader,
as far as I was concerned.

658
00:45:47,736 --> 00:45:52,105
Not for broad's sake,
but just because it was so cool.

659
00:45:53,708 --> 00:46:00,011
Well, I had to... Once I opened out
the drums, I had to open out the vocals.

660
00:46:00,115 --> 00:46:02,845
Oh, right.
Is this the cool fight?

661
00:46:02,951 --> 00:46:04,919
(man) Yeah, yeah.

662
00:46:04,986 --> 00:46:07,784
("Lady Madonna")

663
00:46:26,108 --> 00:46:28,542
- It's in process.
- No, it's good.

664
00:46:37,152 --> 00:46:38,585
(applause stops)

665
00:46:38,653 --> 00:46:40,211
(laughter)

666
00:46:41,189 --> 00:46:43,384
(Champagne) We trained for that.

667
00:46:43,458 --> 00:46:45,949
Yeah, what to say?

668
00:46:46,027 --> 00:46:50,828
We just watched a little bit of it.
We think it's fantastic, very exciting.

669
00:46:50,899 --> 00:46:54,232
I think you're great acrobats,
great performers.

670
00:46:54,302 --> 00:46:59,501
And I think it's going to be a fantastic
show. Really fantastic. So thank you.

671
00:47:02,077 --> 00:47:05,103
- But I want you to work harder!
- (laughter)

672
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:08,513
Harder! Much harder!
That's it!

673
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:18,281
(men sing African song)

674
00:47:40,215 --> 00:47:43,776
("Octopus's Garden")

675
00:47:43,852 --> 00:47:46,446
(Champagne in French)

676
00:47:52,961 --> 00:47:58,399
Every morning, before I get out of bed, I
put the Beatles on and order room service.

677
00:47:58,466 --> 00:48:01,663
No, I don't. I don't.

678
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:06,739
You know, if it's on, it's on.

679
00:48:06,841 --> 00:48:10,800
Sometimes, I'll play a Beatles record
and say, "Wow, look."

680
00:48:10,912 --> 00:48:13,346
"Listen to that on that track."

681
00:48:15,283 --> 00:48:17,979
Any combination,
it seems that Beatles tracks work

682
00:48:18,053 --> 00:48:20,715
because the tracks
are strong enough.

683
00:48:20,789 --> 00:48:22,950
That's the deal.

684
00:48:23,024 --> 00:48:25,219
("Octopus's Garden")

685
00:48:27,462 --> 00:48:30,431
(Giles Martin) Ringo loves
the fact that his...

686
00:48:30,498 --> 00:48:34,901
He's a great drummer. I mean,
I've learnt how good a drummer he is

687
00:48:35,003 --> 00:48:38,564
because I had the ability to remove him
from a song and put him back on

688
00:48:38,673 --> 00:48:42,666
so the song becomes... He plays the song
unlike any other drummer.

689
00:48:42,744 --> 00:48:48,273
He doesn't play necessarily a fixed, "This
is my drum part," he'll play the song.

690
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:52,719
He really is a song-playing drummer.
But he has a groove that's his own.

691
00:48:52,787 --> 00:48:57,019
So if I can take him playing one song
and stick it in another,

692
00:48:57,125 --> 00:49:00,253
he loves it because it's like,
"It's me, but it's more me."

693
00:49:00,362 --> 00:49:03,627
("Drive My Car")

694
00:49:04,666 --> 00:49:08,432
Asked a girl
what she wanted to be

695
00:49:08,503 --> 00:49:11,961
She said,
"Baby, can't you see?"

696
00:49:13,508 --> 00:49:16,534
(Starr) My dream at 13
was to play drums.

697
00:49:17,112 --> 00:49:19,342
I started in hospital.

698
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:24,010
I was in hospital
with tuberculosis for a year,

699
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:26,314
and so to keep us busy...

700
00:49:26,388 --> 00:49:28,788
I learned to knit.

701
00:49:30,158 --> 00:49:33,559
So they'd give you, like, things to do
'cause we couldn't do a lot.

702
00:49:33,628 --> 00:49:36,426
So then,
every couple of weeks,

703
00:49:36,498 --> 00:49:41,595
a music teacher would come in
with little drums, tambourines, maracas.

704
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:46,972
I fell in love with the drum. I wouldn't be in
the hospital band unless I got a drum.

705
00:49:47,075 --> 00:49:52,707
Then I came out of hospital and made
my own snare drum out of a biscuit tin

706
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:55,272
and pieces of firewood as sticks.

707
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:58,012
I couldn't play, but I could hit.

708
00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:00,952
You know,
and that's how it started.

709
00:50:01,022 --> 00:50:06,551
Now they give me a drum set a week,
you know, if I want one.

710
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:08,960
It's so hard.
You got nothing, you get nothing.

711
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:11,760
You got everything,
they'll give you anything.

712
00:50:11,833 --> 00:50:14,666
("A Day in the Life")

713
00:50:19,507 --> 00:50:24,001
I read the news today,
oh, boy

714
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:30,146
About a lucky man
who made the grade

715
00:50:30,218 --> 00:50:35,918
Well, I think that the show has to have
some gritty or sad moments too,

716
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:38,481
because that was life.
That is life, you know?

717
00:50:38,593 --> 00:50:43,758
And it can't just be happy-go-lucky
from the beginning to end.

718
00:50:47,135 --> 00:50:52,437
I remember when I went to the Dakota
building and Yoko Ono's apartment

719
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:54,941
to present
the concept of the show.

720
00:50:55,043 --> 00:51:00,003
And I remember the moment
of John Lennon's murder.

721
00:51:00,115 --> 00:51:04,051
And when I came up there,
I was really, like... (sighs)

722
00:51:04,152 --> 00:51:07,349
I was really shaken

723
00:51:07,422 --> 00:51:11,290
by just being there.

724
00:51:11,393 --> 00:51:15,659
And she offered me a cup of tea.

725
00:51:15,764 --> 00:51:19,063
She told me, "Welcome into this."

726
00:51:19,134 --> 00:51:21,659
Then I just felt more comfortable,

727
00:51:21,736 --> 00:51:26,139
and simply I expressed
what I thought the show should be,

728
00:51:26,241 --> 00:51:32,407
and I left the meeting with
great encouragement and strength.

729
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:39,611
I read the news today, oh, boy

730
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:45,253
Julia is the character of a song
on the White Album,

731
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,760
but she is also John Lennon's mother

732
00:51:47,829 --> 00:51:52,926
who was killed by a policeman
driving a car when he was a teenager.

733
00:51:53,034 --> 00:52:00,907
And as you can hear him singing
"Julia" or "Mother" in his solo career,

734
00:52:00,975 --> 00:52:05,969
you can appreciate
how sensitive he was about her.

735
00:52:08,283 --> 00:52:12,720
Then, is it too sensitive to be there
with the blessing of the Beatles?

736
00:52:12,787 --> 00:52:18,589
(Ono) I'm very glad that "Julia"
is something that they're working on.

737
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:23,530
John had an incredible, incredible
love for his mother.

738
00:52:23,631 --> 00:52:25,929
He was very, very saddened

739
00:52:26,034 --> 00:52:31,301
that his mother never saw him
become so famous.

740
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:36,074
And that was one thing
that he regretted all the time.

741
00:52:36,144 --> 00:52:38,908
("Julia")

742
00:52:42,984 --> 00:52:46,147
(George Martin) People say,
"What's your favorite song?"

743
00:52:46,221 --> 00:52:48,746
I say, "I don't know -
there were so many of them."

744
00:52:48,823 --> 00:52:53,351
But if I had to pick one of John's it would
probably be "Strawberry Fields Forever".

745
00:52:53,428 --> 00:52:57,262
It's such an extraordinary song.

746
00:52:57,332 --> 00:53:00,426
And the first time I heard it,
we'd been...

747
00:53:00,502 --> 00:53:05,030
Up to that point, we'd been making
albums which we had to rush,

748
00:53:05,106 --> 00:53:08,906
until they made the decision,
wisely and rightly,

749
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:12,003
not to do any more touring
but to concentrate on recording.

750
00:53:12,113 --> 00:53:15,776
And the very first song
we recorded after that decision

751
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:18,318
was John's "Strawberry Fields".

752
00:53:18,386 --> 00:53:23,153
As usual, I perched myself
on a high chair, like a bar stool,

753
00:53:23,224 --> 00:53:27,661
and John stood in front of me with his
acoustic guitar and started singing.

754
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:34,330
No one, I think, is in my tree

755
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:38,834
And I was knocked out.
I thought, "What an extraordinary song."

756
00:53:38,907 --> 00:53:40,465
"What a beautiful song."

757
00:53:40,542 --> 00:53:45,138
He was a marvelous man,
but he was never really satisfied

758
00:53:45,213 --> 00:53:47,545
with anything he did.

759
00:53:48,483 --> 00:53:51,714
In the year before he died
I spent a night with him,

760
00:53:51,786 --> 00:53:55,051
and we talked about old times.

761
00:53:55,156 --> 00:53:58,489
We had a lovely evening.
Then out of the blue, he said to me:

762
00:53:58,593 --> 00:54:01,357
"You know, George, if I could,

763
00:54:01,429 --> 00:54:05,661
I'd record everything we did again."

764
00:54:05,733 --> 00:54:10,227
I said, "You can't be serious, John.
We did some great stuff."

765
00:54:10,305 --> 00:54:14,173
"What are you on about?"
He said, "We could have done it better."

766
00:54:14,275 --> 00:54:16,368
I said, "What about 'Strawberry Fields'?"

767
00:54:16,477 --> 00:54:20,880
And he looked at me over his glasses and
he said, "Especially 'Strawberry Fields'."

768
00:54:20,949 --> 00:54:26,148
And I thought, "Gosh," you know.
I practically bled for that song.

769
00:54:27,355 --> 00:54:30,916
Nothing is real

770
00:54:30,992 --> 00:54:34,792
And nothing to get hung about

771
00:54:34,862 --> 00:54:38,263
(Giles Martin) After we did it
using the different versions,

772
00:54:38,333 --> 00:54:40,858
Yoko said it was nothing
to do with the music at all,

773
00:54:40,935 --> 00:54:44,735
it was that he didn't like his voice on it,
he didn't like his singing on it.

774
00:54:44,839 --> 00:54:48,866
He had a great voice and yet he was
always asking me to distort it:

775
00:54:48,943 --> 00:54:51,537
"Put more tape echo on it.
I can't bear that."

776
00:54:51,613 --> 00:54:58,177
I think that also John had this vision
in his mind which was a fantastic sound

777
00:54:58,252 --> 00:55:00,117
and he wanted it to be realized.

778
00:55:00,188 --> 00:55:02,179
But he was never very practical.

779
00:55:02,256 --> 00:55:08,559
He would talk to me in
terms of colors and so on, and dreams.

780
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:12,498
And I had to pin him down, saying,
"OK, what instrument do you use?"

781
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,591
"How do we get this off the ground?"

782
00:55:14,669 --> 00:55:16,603
He didn't want
to be bothered with that.

783
00:55:16,671 --> 00:55:19,834
He wanted to create something
that would just flow.

784
00:55:19,907 --> 00:55:21,875
("Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds")

785
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:24,104
(man) Le prochain.

786
00:55:26,347 --> 00:55:29,145
Regarde ta boule.

787
00:55:31,719 --> 00:55:37,351
Somebody calls you,
you answer quite slowly

788
00:55:37,425 --> 00:55:39,985
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

789
00:55:40,061 --> 00:55:44,896
(George Martin) I want you to fix me up
so that I can do one of those things.

790
00:55:44,999 --> 00:55:47,934
- You mean hang with harnesses?
- I could join her up there.

791
00:55:48,036 --> 00:55:50,664
- Well, no problem.
- (both laugh)

792
00:56:06,454 --> 00:56:08,115
(cheering and applause)

793
00:56:08,189 --> 00:56:13,627
So today with your presence,
we do the traditional "Lion Den."

794
00:56:13,695 --> 00:56:16,220
It's the first time we run it with the public.

795
00:56:16,297 --> 00:56:20,825
So you are our lion,
and we hope that you don't eat us.

796
00:56:21,936 --> 00:56:26,168
Well, we try to run it, as much
as possible, smoothly for you guys,

797
00:56:26,274 --> 00:56:30,574
and enjoy everything with love.

798
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:33,738
(cheering and applause)

799
00:56:37,719 --> 00:56:40,381
("Gnik Nus")

800
00:57:04,112 --> 00:57:08,879
Something in the way she moves

801
00:57:12,153 --> 00:57:16,783
Attracts me like no other lover

802
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:24,660
Something in the way she woos me

803
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:29,829
I don't want to leave her now

804
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:32,634
You know I believe, and how

805
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:41,780
(Champagne) Go, go, go!
They're all late. They're all late.

806
00:57:41,883 --> 00:57:47,116
("Within You Without You"/
"Tomorrow Never Knows")

807
00:57:47,188 --> 00:57:51,249
We were talking

808
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:55,027
(woman) Guys, pull north.
Pull north.

809
00:57:58,466 --> 00:58:01,993
And the people

810
00:58:02,703 --> 00:58:06,036
Who hide themselves

811
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:09,838
Behind a wall

812
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:12,769
Sitting on a cornflake

813
00:58:14,682 --> 00:58:17,845
Waiting for the van to come

814
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:19,783
(Champagne in French)

815
00:58:21,589 --> 00:58:23,489
Man, you've been a naughty boy

816
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:26,756
(Champagne) His gas mask?
Where his gas mask is?

817
00:58:26,828 --> 00:58:29,388
I am the eggman

818
00:58:29,463 --> 00:58:32,193
They are the eggmen

819
00:58:32,266 --> 00:58:34,325
I am the walrus

820
00:58:34,435 --> 00:58:36,096
Goo, goo, g'joob

821
00:58:36,904 --> 00:58:39,304
Here come old flat top

822
00:58:39,373 --> 00:58:41,068
(Champagne) Video, no?

823
00:58:42,343 --> 00:58:45,471
They're late.

824
00:58:45,546 --> 00:58:47,878
This looks bad.

825
00:58:47,949 --> 00:58:53,319
He got hair down to his knee

826
00:58:54,355 --> 00:58:59,816
Got to be a joker,
he just do what he please

827
00:59:07,401 --> 00:59:12,236
- I want to talk to him.
- Well, he's going to come. Guy's...

828
00:59:12,306 --> 00:59:16,072
- Why don't we just go to that table?
- Sure, sure.

829
00:59:16,477 --> 00:59:18,945
I mean, what is it? It's sleazy.

830
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:21,675
This "Come Together"
is not a sleazy song.

831
00:59:21,749 --> 00:59:25,207
- It's a song of political coming together.
- I see what you mean.

832
00:59:25,319 --> 00:59:27,617
(Ono) You're not inspired
with John's songs?

833
00:59:27,722 --> 00:59:29,986
- (Champagne) I am, honestly.
- Great.

834
00:59:30,057 --> 00:59:32,958
Tell me what you were inspired about,
and the words.

835
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:37,760
He's singing so well and I feel so sorry
for him because nothing's going on.

836
00:59:37,832 --> 00:59:40,892
It's just making it like...
Oh, "atmospheric" is the word.

837
00:59:41,002 --> 00:59:46,497
But it's not atmospheric.
Beatles' thing is power. Also...

838
00:59:46,574 --> 00:59:51,443
I have, you know, a lot of respect
for him, for having done this much.

839
00:59:51,512 --> 00:59:56,848
And of course we're all still saying, "Well,
could you just..." et cetera, et cetera.

840
00:59:56,951 --> 00:59:59,818
Olivia is going there and I'm going there

841
00:59:59,921 --> 01:00:05,359
because we are very protective
of our husbands' songs, you know.

842
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,760
So he's got a lot to deal with, really.

843
01:00:09,797 --> 01:00:12,322
(Champagne in French)

844
01:00:17,038 --> 01:00:19,302
- (they laugh)
- Oh, la, la, la, la.

845
01:00:19,373 --> 01:00:21,898
(woman over PA) OK.

846
01:00:21,976 --> 01:00:23,739
("All You Need is Love")

847
01:00:23,811 --> 01:00:28,339
- All you need is love
- All together now.

848
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:32,750
- All you need is love
- Everybody.

849
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:37,382
All you need is love, love

850
01:00:37,458 --> 01:00:39,790
Love is all you need

851
01:00:40,027 --> 01:00:41,790
Love is all you need

852
01:00:42,029 --> 01:00:43,826
Love is all you need

853
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:46,256
Love is all you need

Love is all you need

01:00:53,174 --> 01:00:55,074
Love is all you need

858
01:00:55,309 --> 01:00:56,936
Love is all you need

859
01:00:57,011 --> 01:00:59,411
(cheering and applause)

860
01:01:19,266 --> 01:01:21,860
- See you later.
- See you.

861
01:01:21,936 --> 01:01:24,427
(Olivia Harrison) OK, see you later.

862
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:28,867
- You like it?
- When the pictures come up...

863
01:01:28,943 --> 01:01:31,935
- The smile?
- The smile, it just kills me.

864
01:01:32,013 --> 01:01:36,916
And, you know, Dhani is just like him,
so to see exactly...

865
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:39,976
- It's amazing.
- It's like twins.

866
01:01:40,788 --> 01:01:44,189
Oh! No, you can take that after.
Very cold ice.

867
01:01:44,258 --> 01:01:47,159
My feet are going to shatter.

868
01:01:47,628 --> 01:01:50,096
- (man) If only you could feel them.
- Exactly.

869
01:01:50,197 --> 01:01:54,258
Do you think this is a departure,
this is a change for Cirque?

870
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:56,860
The dancing, the staging,
the way it's presented?

871
01:01:56,937 --> 01:02:00,964
Yeah, it is. This is more a musical
than a Cirque show.

872
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:04,569
- You could have told us!
- Huh?

873
01:02:04,678 --> 01:02:09,775
Yeah, you know, 'cause I think
people are gonna be surprised.

874
01:02:09,850 --> 01:02:14,344
- In terms of not having many acrobatics?
- I hope they're not disappointed.

875
01:02:14,422 --> 01:02:16,322
- Yeah, that type...
- Well...

876
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:19,359
I don't think they expect...
People will come for the music,

877
01:02:19,427 --> 01:02:22,760
the encounter of the Cirque du Soleil
and the Beatles.

878
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:26,823
Now it's a question of tidying up things
and clarifying things.

879
01:02:26,901 --> 01:02:31,429
That's why it's important to get... That's
what I like about the opinion of Yoko.

880
01:02:31,505 --> 01:02:34,440
This is what we need,
because we were not there with them.

881
01:02:34,508 --> 01:02:37,671
You know, especially with Yoko and you,
we were not there.

882
01:02:37,745 --> 01:02:42,808
With George I didn't have time
to go into detail of each of the songs.

883
01:02:42,917 --> 01:02:45,351
I want to make sure
the details are addressed.

884
01:02:45,419 --> 01:02:48,320
Like I said, at the end
we have to make a decision

885
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:53,850
because we can't do a show
in a community way.

886
01:02:53,961 --> 01:02:57,920
As long as there is something...
each one has something going,

887
01:02:58,032 --> 01:03:01,001
- and there's some focus.
- But it's the same thing.

888
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:04,162
That's what I always bring back
to the people I work with.

889
01:03:04,271 --> 01:03:08,503
I said, "It's not about
who has the best idea."

890
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:11,204
"It's what is the best idea,
who will prevail."

891
01:03:11,312 --> 01:03:15,976
Of course, everybody has
his personality, his pride

892
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:19,247
and his ego,
and I totally understand that.

893
01:03:19,353 --> 01:03:22,186
But at the end, we're all there
to serve one thing -

894
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:24,247
- the show for the public.
- The show.

895
01:03:24,358 --> 01:03:29,057
They will decide who will live or die
with what we do.

896
01:03:53,921 --> 01:03:57,948
(Proteau) In Montreal, I have a family.
I have three sons.

897
01:03:58,025 --> 01:04:00,289
May we present the Beatles?

898
01:04:00,394 --> 01:04:04,125
So this is a kind of sacrifice
that maybe I do.

899
01:04:05,199 --> 01:04:10,694
The last time I saw them was at the end
of March because my father died.

900
01:04:14,942 --> 01:04:22,144
When I open the show, I just feel that...
that I'm doing that for my father.

901
01:04:33,194 --> 01:04:37,528
I bring a message from Apple,
my boss Neil Aspinall,

902
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:41,123
and from Paul and Ringo
and Yoko and Olivia

903
01:04:41,235 --> 01:04:43,328
to wish you the very best for tonight,

904
01:04:43,437 --> 01:04:49,774
and express their profound respect for
your skill, your energy, your courage.

905
01:04:49,877 --> 01:04:52,607
One day, this will all seem
like a long time ago,

906
01:04:52,713 --> 01:04:57,116
so savor the moment,
and you have my best wishes.

907
01:05:05,492 --> 01:05:09,758
(Champagne) We all know we worked
really hard. It was not an easy one.

908
01:05:09,830 --> 01:05:15,427
All the Beatles themselves - Paul, Ringo,
Yoko and Olivia and their family,

909
01:05:15,502 --> 01:05:21,668
tonight we have the honor to have also
Cynthia Lennon, first wife of John Lennon,

910
01:05:21,742 --> 01:05:27,738
is going to be here with Julian Lennon
and Sean, and Dhani Harrison.

911
01:05:27,815 --> 01:05:31,546
And all those people gathered around
with what you've done,

912
01:05:31,619 --> 01:05:35,111
with what we've all done together.

913
01:05:35,189 --> 01:05:37,350
I think it's great that...

914
01:05:37,424 --> 01:05:39,449
You know, bodies go.

915
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:45,430
George Harrison is dead, but we can
really say that his spirit is with us.

916
01:05:47,001 --> 01:05:51,529
And we gave a body
to that spirit all together.

917
01:05:51,639 --> 01:05:53,834
- Peace and love. I love you.
- (applause)

918
01:06:06,787 --> 01:06:08,584
(hums to himself)

919
01:06:11,225 --> 01:06:14,888
You told me once that you had
le symptme de I'imposteur.

920
01:06:14,995 --> 01:06:17,759
- Yeah.
- How's that now?

921
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,225
Well...

922
01:06:24,138 --> 01:06:27,699
It's hard to answer that, you know?

923
01:06:29,343 --> 01:06:31,504
I'm happy that we...

924
01:06:31,578 --> 01:06:35,674
I've been a lot... very nostalgic of the '60s,
you know?

925
01:06:35,749 --> 01:06:39,947
All those years of freedom and revolution.

926
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:45,788
And I felt I was having my 20s
more in a decade of cynicism.

927
01:06:45,859 --> 01:06:48,794
And I've been pretty cynical myself.

928
01:06:48,862 --> 01:06:53,595
And I feel like today I'm back to the roots,
you know,

929
01:06:53,667 --> 01:07:00,470
of dreaming that we can take a sad song
and make it better, as the man said.

930
01:07:00,541 --> 01:07:02,941
("Because")

931
01:07:09,550 --> 01:07:14,351
Because the world is round

932
01:07:14,421 --> 01:07:20,758
It turns me on

933
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:34,366
Because the world is round

934
01:07:37,745 --> 01:07:42,409
Ah

935
01:07:42,516 --> 01:07:44,643
(Giles Martin) It was a great experience.

936
01:07:44,752 --> 01:07:47,983
I've tried to get away from
the George Martin mantle, you know?

937
01:07:48,055 --> 01:07:50,182
"George's son, in he comes."

938
01:07:50,257 --> 01:07:53,249
But it's been a huge learning curve for me.

939
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,385
And it's your dad, you know?

940
01:07:55,462 --> 01:07:58,329
You spend time going through his stuff.

941
01:07:58,432 --> 01:08:01,663
In a way, a father and son team,
you know, in years to come,

942
01:08:01,735 --> 01:08:05,865
I'll probably remember this more
than I'll remember the show.

943
01:08:11,912 --> 01:08:15,746
Ah

944
01:08:15,816 --> 01:08:19,115
Love is old, love is new

945
01:08:19,186 --> 01:08:24,488
I guess I'm used
to all these celebrities and stuff.

946
01:08:24,591 --> 01:08:31,520
Even in South Africa, I've been
performing for big people,

947
01:08:31,632 --> 01:08:35,864
like even the president of South
Africa, which is Nelson Mandela.

948
01:08:35,936 --> 01:08:40,464
I've performed for him. So it's not
a big deal. It's not a big issue.

949
01:08:40,541 --> 01:08:44,568
I'm just going to do what I do best.
You know what I'm saying?

950
01:08:47,014 --> 01:08:48,948
("Get Back")

951
01:08:51,985 --> 01:08:54,351
(cheering and applause)

952
01:09:09,803 --> 01:09:13,534
Jo Jo was a man
who thought he was a loner

953
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:17,337
But he knew it couldn't last

954
01:09:17,444 --> 01:09:20,971
Jo Jo left his home in Tucson, Arizona

955
01:09:21,081 --> 01:09:24,847
For some California grass

956
01:09:24,952 --> 01:09:28,319
Get back, get back

957
01:09:28,388 --> 01:09:31,949
Get back to where you once belonged

958
01:09:32,593 --> 01:09:36,393
Get back, get back

959
01:09:36,463 --> 01:09:39,261
Get back to where you once belonged

960
01:09:39,333 --> 01:09:40,891
Get back, Jo Jo

961
01:09:41,001 --> 01:09:43,834
(Starr) If you hear that music,
there's four people.

962
01:09:43,904 --> 01:09:47,897
It doesn't matter that only Paul and I
are here, there's still four people.

963
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:52,935
There are only two of us now,
but in spirit there's four of us, you know?

964
01:09:53,013 --> 01:09:54,878
("Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!")

965
01:09:54,948 --> 01:09:57,143
The band begins at ten to six

966
01:09:57,217 --> 01:10:01,847
When Mr. K performs his tricks
without a sound

967
01:10:03,423 --> 01:10:05,687
And Mr. H will demonstrate

968
01:10:05,792 --> 01:10:09,888
Ten somersets he'll undertake
on solid ground

969
01:10:09,997 --> 01:10:12,227
Having been some days in preparation

970
01:10:12,299 --> 01:10:15,996
A splendid time is guaranteed for all

971
01:10:16,436 --> 01:10:20,964
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill

972
01:10:31,151 --> 01:10:33,711
(cheering and applause)

973
01:10:35,556 --> 01:10:37,956
("Drive My Car")

974
01:10:40,027 --> 01:10:43,793
Asked a girl what she wanted to be

975
01:10:43,864 --> 01:10:47,527
She said, "Baby, can't you see?"

976
01:10:47,634 --> 01:10:51,161
I wanna be famous, a star of the screen

977
01:10:51,271 --> 01:10:54,707
But you can do something in between

978
01:10:54,775 --> 01:10:57,335
Baby, you can drive my car

979
01:10:59,546 --> 01:11:01,343
I was sitting next to Ringo,

980
01:11:01,415 --> 01:11:04,646
so it was great because
I just kept saying to him:

981
01:11:04,751 --> 01:11:06,844
"What a fucking great band we were."

982
01:11:06,954 --> 01:11:11,220
I should be more modest. I should say, "It
was good" and, "Thank you very much. "

983
01:11:11,291 --> 01:11:15,193
But I don't care now.
The Beatles is over. It's a body of work.

984
01:11:15,262 --> 01:11:18,993
And I can now stand back and say,
"That was great."

985
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:21,728
("Octopus's Garden")

986
01:11:21,835 --> 01:11:26,966
I'd ask my friends to come and see

987
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:32,273
An octopus's garden with me

988
01:11:32,346 --> 01:11:35,975
I'd like to be under the sea

989
01:11:36,817 --> 01:11:40,719
In an octopus's garden in the shade

990
01:11:42,689 --> 01:11:45,089
We would be warm

991
01:11:45,192 --> 01:11:47,183
Below the storm

992
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:52,425
(Starr) You think, "Oh, you know,
it was a long time ago."

993
01:11:52,499 --> 01:11:56,959
And what's interesting is that now
we are these people

994
01:11:57,070 --> 01:11:59,231
but the music still carries on.

995
01:11:59,306 --> 01:12:02,298
It's not our personalities, it's the music.

996
01:12:02,376 --> 01:12:05,106
("A Day in the Life")

997
01:12:09,049 --> 01:12:13,145
I read the news today, oh, boy

998
01:12:14,921 --> 01:12:19,756
Four thousand holes
in Blackburn, Lancashire

999
01:12:20,827 --> 01:12:24,627
And though the holes were rather small

1000
01:12:26,667 --> 01:12:29,227
They had to count them all

1001
01:12:29,302 --> 01:12:33,705
Now they know how many holes
it takes to fill the Albert Hall

1002
01:12:34,708 --> 01:12:41,944
I'd love to turn you on

1003
01:13:01,601 --> 01:13:04,297
(applause)

1004
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:16,272
(Lennon) Just keep going, then.

1005
01:13:16,349 --> 01:13:19,147
(Starr) Just keep going.

1006
01:13:19,219 --> 01:13:21,449
(Harrison) Keep going.

1007
01:13:22,589 --> 01:13:25,023
(McCartney) Keep going.

1008
01:13:25,425 --> 01:13:28,690
- (Harrison) Peace.
- (Lennon) Peace.

1009
01:13:28,795 --> 01:13:32,196
I look at you all

1010
01:13:32,265 --> 01:13:36,531
See the love there that's sleeping

1011
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:43,106
While my guitar gently weeps

1012
01:13:44,077 --> 01:13:47,535
I look at the floor

1013
01:13:47,614 --> 01:13:51,744
And I see it needs sweeping

1014
01:13:51,818 --> 01:13:54,412
Every time I heard George's voice
or saw the image,

1015
01:13:54,521 --> 01:13:56,648
you just want to pull them off the...

1016
01:13:56,757 --> 01:13:59,555
You want to pull them right there
because it's so close

1017
01:13:59,626 --> 01:14:02,356
and the voices are so intimate
and so familiar,

1018
01:14:02,429 --> 01:14:05,330
the way that they just resonate
in your ear

1019
01:14:05,432 --> 01:14:07,593
in a vibration that nobody else has.

1020
01:14:08,535 --> 01:14:13,563
How to unfold your love

1021
01:14:15,075 --> 01:14:20,012
Dhani said it was hard for him. It made
him very sad because it's so close,

1022
01:14:20,113 --> 01:14:25,210
and yet, you know...
physically unsatisfying.

1023
01:14:25,318 --> 01:14:27,786
But, spiritually, very satisfying.

1024
01:14:27,854 --> 01:14:33,554
("Within You Without You"/
"Tomorrow Never Knows")

1025
01:14:33,627 --> 01:14:38,860
Try to realize it's all within yourself

1026
01:14:38,932 --> 01:14:43,130
No one else can make you change

1027
01:14:45,138 --> 01:14:50,440
And to see you're really only very small

1028
01:14:50,510 --> 01:14:56,847
And life flows on within you
and without you

1029
01:14:58,518 --> 01:15:01,043
(cheering and applause)

1030
01:15:10,864 --> 01:15:13,059
(Lennon) Come on, George.
You ready, Ring?

1031
01:15:13,133 --> 01:15:15,192
- (Starr) I think.
- What shall I do now?

1032
01:15:15,268 --> 01:15:17,634
- (McCartney) Swing it, man.
- Swing it, swing it.

1033
01:15:17,704 --> 01:15:20,138
- (McCartney) Right, let's go.
- (engineer) Take four.

1034
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:21,571
(strums)

1035
01:15:21,675 --> 01:15:23,142
- Ringo.
- Do it again.

1036
01:15:23,210 --> 01:15:25,906
One, two, three, four.

1037
01:15:25,979 --> 01:15:28,709
("Strawberry Fields Forever")

1038
01:15:28,782 --> 01:15:33,810
No one, I think, is in my tree

1039
01:15:34,721 --> 01:15:38,282
I mean, it must be high or low

1040
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:45,798
That is, you can't, you know,
tune in, but it's all right

1041
01:15:45,866 --> 01:15:51,498
(Ono) It's the light that is not here
anymore, you know?

1042
01:15:51,605 --> 01:15:55,132
It's that one, isn't it?

1043
01:15:55,208 --> 01:15:57,335
John was there.

1044
01:15:57,444 --> 01:16:05,044
But it's very different from listening to his
songs and seeing a show of it, you know?

1045
01:16:06,052 --> 01:16:09,749
It always makes me feel a little bit...

1046
01:16:12,392 --> 01:16:14,986
Well, sad is not the word.
Well, it is, you know.

1047
01:16:15,061 --> 01:16:19,691
I feel sad that he's just a voice now.

1048
01:16:19,799 --> 01:16:21,790
He rollercoaster

1049
01:16:21,868 --> 01:16:24,666
He got early warning

1050
01:16:24,738 --> 01:16:27,639
He got muddy water

1051
01:16:27,707 --> 01:16:30,801
He one mojo filter

1052
01:16:30,911 --> 01:16:36,781
He say one and one and one is three

1053
01:16:37,217 --> 01:16:42,314
Got to be good-looking
'cause he's so hard to see

1054
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:45,153
Come together

1055
01:16:45,225 --> 01:16:47,625
Right now

1056
01:16:48,295 --> 01:16:50,661
Over me

1057
01:16:53,066 --> 01:16:56,035
(Starr) John had a huge heart, you know.
He was a good man.

1058
01:16:56,102 --> 01:17:00,300
He was very sharp
and, you know, had this quick wit.

1059
01:17:00,373 --> 01:17:03,308
And George in the band
was my best friend.

1060
01:17:03,743 --> 01:17:07,144
Paul is incredible.
An incredible man.

1061
01:17:07,213 --> 01:17:11,707
He's still the most melodic bass player
out there today.

1062
01:17:11,785 --> 01:17:16,119
You know, it was
a really, really great band.

1063
01:17:16,189 --> 01:17:18,749
("Back in the USSR")

1064
01:17:18,825 --> 01:17:21,851
Show me round the snow-peaked
mountains way down south

1065
01:17:21,962 --> 01:17:25,056
Take me to your daddy's farm

1066
01:17:25,665 --> 01:17:28,793
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out

1067
01:17:28,868 --> 01:17:31,132
Come and keep your comrade warm

1068
01:17:31,237 --> 01:17:34,331
I'm back in the USSR

1069
01:17:34,441 --> 01:17:37,308
You don't know how lucky you are, boy

1070
01:17:37,944 --> 01:17:40,708
Back in the USSR

1071
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:43,271
Let me tell you, honey

1072
01:17:43,350 --> 01:17:47,582
I'm back, I'm back in the USSR

1073
01:17:47,654 --> 01:17:50,589
It's so good to be

1074
01:17:50,657 --> 01:17:51,817
Well

1075
01:17:51,925 --> 01:17:54,553
Back in the USSR

("Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts
Club Band (Reprise)")

1077
01:18:02,035 --> 01:18:06,062
We're Sgt Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band

1078
01:18:06,139 --> 01:18:09,165
We hope you have enjoyed the show

1079
01:18:10,176 --> 01:18:14,135
Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

1080
01:18:14,214 --> 01:18:16,739
We're sorry but it's time to go

1081
01:18:18,418 --> 01:18:22,184
Sgt Pepper's Lonely,
Sgt Pepper's Lonely

1082
01:18:22,422 --> 01:18:26,358
Sgt Pepper's Lonely,
Sgt Pepper's Lonely

1083
01:18:26,426 --> 01:18:30,522
Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

1084
01:18:30,630 --> 01:18:34,498
(McCartney) I'm very proud, of course,
of the music we made with the Beatles.

1085
01:18:34,601 --> 01:18:38,162
I can hardly believe it.
It's a slightly strange feeling.

1086
01:18:38,271 --> 01:18:42,503
It's like, I wake up some mornings
and think, "I was in the Beatles?"

1087
01:18:42,575 --> 01:18:48,172
There's only four people who could say
that in the world, in the universe,

1088
01:18:48,281 --> 01:18:49,748
and I'm one of them.

1089
01:18:49,816 --> 01:18:53,252
So it's a slightly sort of strange feeling,

1090
01:18:53,353 --> 01:18:55,753
but an amazing one.

1091
01:18:55,822 --> 01:18:59,417
("All You Need is Love")

1092
01:19:04,230 --> 01:19:07,529
Love, love, love

1093
01:19:08,468 --> 01:19:11,494
Love, love, love

1094
01:19:12,906 --> 01:19:16,501
Love, love, love

1095
01:19:22,515 --> 01:19:25,177
There's nothing you can do
that can't be done

1096
01:19:26,786 --> 01:19:30,119
Nothing you can sing
that can't be sung

1097
01:19:30,990 --> 01:19:34,687
Nothing you can say
but you can learn how to play the game

1098
01:19:35,261 --> 01:19:37,456
It's easy

1099
01:19:40,033 --> 01:19:43,935
Nothing you can make
that can't be made

1100
01:19:44,037 --> 01:19:49,031
(Starr) You can't help but feel
with the chat, with the songs,

1101
01:19:49,109 --> 01:19:50,974
that we're all still there.

1102
01:19:51,077 --> 01:19:56,140
It's a bit like when we did
"Free As A Bird", when John had left us.

1103
01:19:56,216 --> 01:20:01,244
We all had to pretend that he was making
a cup of tea in the kitchen or something.

1104
01:20:01,354 --> 01:20:03,584
You have to get over it, you know?

1105
01:20:03,656 --> 01:20:09,185
Because we were this incredibly
close-knit four-man band.

1106
01:20:09,863 --> 01:20:11,990
All you need is love

1107
01:20:12,065 --> 01:20:14,124
Everybody.

1108

All you need is love, love

Love is all you need

1110
01:20:21,541 --> 01:20:23,372
Love is all you need

1111
01:20:23,643 --> 01:20:25,804
Love is all you need

1112
01:20:26,079 --> 01:20:28,604
Love is all you need

1113
01:20:28,715 --> 01:20:31,206
(George Martin) Each generation,
as it grows up,

1114
01:20:31,317 --> 01:20:34,013
finds the Beatles for themselves.

1115
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:37,146
And now... My children found it
for themselves

1116
01:20:37,223 --> 01:20:41,284
and my grandchildren have found it
for themselves. And it will go on.

1117
01:20:41,394 --> 01:20:43,521
It really will.

1118
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:45,461
Love is all you need

1119
01:20:45,698 --> 01:20:48,531
Love is all you need

1120
01:20:48,801 --> 01:20:50,530
Love is all you need

1121
01:20:53,439 --> 01:20:55,498
(cheering and applause)

1122
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:03,980
Just one special round of applause
for John and George!

1123
01:21:04,050 --> 01:21:06,109
(loud cheering and applause)

1124
01:21:27,507 --> 01:21:29,907
(McCartney) All right,
fade it there, Charlie.

1125
01:21:29,976 --> 01:21:32,945
(Harrison) Take seven.
OK, put the red light off.

1126
01:21:33,012 --> 01:21:36,209
(Lennon) This is Johnny Rhythm
saying good night to yous all,

1127
01:21:36,316 --> 01:21:38,511
and God bless yous.

1128
01:21:38,585 --> 01:21:40,917
(laughter)

1129
01:24:17,471 --> 01:24:20,668
(The Beatles:
"Can You Take Me Back")

1130
01:24:23,377 --> 01:24:26,437
Can you take me back
where I came from?

1131
01:24:26,513 --> 01:24:31,212
Brother, can you take me back?

1132
01:24:31,552 --> 01:24:34,282
Can you take me back?

1133
01:24:38,058 --> 01:24:40,720
Nobody was very sure
how this was going to work.

1134
01:24:40,794 --> 01:24:45,424
It was the first show that Cirque had
that didn't have live musicians.

1135
01:24:45,499 --> 01:24:48,491
We were thinking about
perhaps using live musicians

1136
01:24:48,569 --> 01:24:50,901
for which I would score,
together with tape.

1137
01:24:50,971 --> 01:24:54,702
What we didn't want to do is
to do what everybody else had done

1138
01:24:54,775 --> 01:24:57,938
for the last 35 years
since their separation,

1139
01:24:58,012 --> 01:25:02,642
which is a replica
of The Beatles on stage

1140
01:25:02,716 --> 01:25:05,981
playing imitation of The Beatles' music.

1141
01:25:06,053 --> 01:25:08,920
So we thought, "We've got to do
something different,

1142
01:25:08,989 --> 01:25:13,016
not just play one Beatles song after the
other. We have to offer something new."

1143
01:25:13,093 --> 01:25:17,792
We have the technology to do something
different, so we thought we'd give it a go.

1144
01:25:17,865 --> 01:25:19,958
("The Word")

1145
01:25:20,034 --> 01:25:21,865
It's so fine

1146
01:25:21,935 --> 01:25:23,596
It's sunshine

1147
01:25:23,671 --> 01:25:26,265
It's the word, love

1148
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:28,968
Beep-beep, beep-beep, yeah!

1149
01:25:29,043 --> 01:25:34,140
(man) Because of the nature of the project,
we felt we had to do it with computers.

1150
01:25:34,214 --> 01:25:40,881
So obviously the next stage with that
is that all the tapes have to be digitized -

1151
01:25:40,954 --> 01:25:45,891
put into a format that then George and
Giles could manipulate and play with.

1152
01:25:47,428 --> 01:25:50,420
(Giles) We took all the Beatles
catalog on tape -

1153
01:25:50,497 --> 01:25:53,830
original Beatles four-tracks,
eight-tracks and two-tracks.

1154
01:25:53,901 --> 01:25:58,304
So, in layman's terms, what we're doing
is deconstructing what's happened

1155
01:25:58,372 --> 01:26:02,365
and putting it back together
so it works in a surround format.

1156
01:26:02,443 --> 01:26:05,344
(Hicks) Even though
the rhythm track is on one track,

1157
01:26:05,412 --> 01:26:09,007
another tape has the bass,
the drums and the guitars separated.

1158
01:26:09,083 --> 01:26:14,077
So they have a way where they can lock
that tape up to the master tape,

1159
01:26:14,154 --> 01:26:17,920
then just have all your separate elements
to work with and play with.

1160
01:26:17,991 --> 01:26:23,657
So that was just really sort of
delving back, dissecting history, really.

1161
01:26:27,701 --> 01:26:32,070
(Ringo Starr) Not just a mix of the music,
not just the same track remixed.

1162
01:26:32,139 --> 01:26:34,300
It's the track reworked.

1163
01:26:34,374 --> 01:26:37,309
So it's like it's new, you know?

1164
01:26:37,377 --> 01:26:41,438
And how difficult is that
when most of it was on four-track?

1165
01:26:41,515 --> 01:26:45,007
'Cause that's how we worked when
we started - four-track to eight-track.

1166
01:26:45,085 --> 01:26:49,579
We never got to the 72s,
like they have now. So it was great.

1167
01:26:49,656 --> 01:26:53,285
(Paul McCartney) We'd said to them,
"Be as experimental as you can."

1168
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:56,761
And so they gave us
this little demo playback.

1169
01:26:56,830 --> 01:27:01,460
And suddenly they'd taken
"Within You Without You"

1170
01:27:01,535 --> 01:27:04,095
and put the "Tomorrow Never Knows"
drums on it,

1171
01:27:04,171 --> 01:27:08,130
and then started to bring in a guitar
from here and a thing from there.

1172
01:27:08,208 --> 01:27:12,872
And we went, "That's it exactly.
That's what we're talking about."

1173
01:27:12,946 --> 01:27:16,143
And I think we were all amazed
at how well it worked.

1174
01:27:17,251 --> 01:27:19,412
I'll bring in the song gradually.

1175
01:27:19,486 --> 01:27:23,445
("Tomorrow Never Knows" intro)

1176
01:27:23,524 --> 01:27:26,823
(segues into "Within You Without You")

1177
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:35,664
If I take down "Tomorrow" now...

1178
01:27:38,438 --> 01:27:43,102
(Yoko Ono) George Martin and Giles
Martin did justice to The Beatles' music.

1179
01:27:43,177 --> 01:27:46,840
And not only that,
but I think they went a step further.

1180
01:27:46,914 --> 01:27:51,613
This is showing
that the music is so strong,

1181
01:27:51,685 --> 01:27:55,177
an incredible artistic power that it has,

1182
01:27:55,255 --> 01:27:59,419
that it can be used in a different way.

1183
01:27:59,493 --> 01:28:03,122
(Giles) You're playing with what
everyone holds so precious and dear.

1184
01:28:03,197 --> 01:28:08,863
They heard it and loved it. They loved
the idea of not doing something ordinary.

1185
01:28:08,936 --> 01:28:13,032
And The Beatles never, never did
anything ordinary.

1186
01:28:17,578 --> 01:28:21,844
(George) "Tomorrow Never Knows"
has got a great rhythm sound to it.

1187
01:28:21,915 --> 01:28:24,975
Ringo's drums are very hypnotic.

1188
01:28:25,052 --> 01:28:29,386
And, of course, "Within You Without You"
is a well-known George song.

1189
01:28:29,456 --> 01:28:31,981
It was a matter of fitting, really,

1190
01:28:32,059 --> 01:28:36,086
because there are moments when
you have to stop it, then start again.

1191
01:28:36,163 --> 01:28:40,224
You have to work with the original rhythm
and tabla sound, and so on.

1192
01:28:42,669 --> 01:28:49,165
I think George's love of those sounds
of Indian instruments was so prescient.

1193
01:28:49,243 --> 01:28:52,303
They're timeless instruments
and he always knew that.

1194
01:28:52,379 --> 01:28:55,109
That's why he loved them
and he loved to use them.

1195
01:28:55,182 --> 01:29:03,351
But it's amazing that today they actually
add some kind of edge to the music.

1196
01:29:03,423 --> 01:29:05,584
(Giles) The Beatles recorded in a very...

1197
01:29:05,659 --> 01:29:10,494
My father was economical - he always
says this - with how things were done.

1198
01:29:10,564 --> 01:29:13,624
People go,
"You could use the drums from Help!"

1199
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:19,400
You go, "No, I can't. They're with the
guitars and the bass." That's a challenge.

1200
01:29:19,473 --> 01:29:23,375
People go, "Why didn't you use this?"
But they're tied together.

1201
01:29:23,443 --> 01:29:30,110
Turn off your mind, relax
and float downstream

1202
01:29:33,654 --> 01:29:37,454
It is not dying

1203
01:29:39,092 --> 01:29:42,892
It is not dying

1204
01:29:48,001 --> 01:29:52,995
There's so much space in what they did.
Suddenly the tablas had more importance

1205
01:29:53,073 --> 01:29:59,410
and the different instruments
just flying around the room.

1206
01:29:59,479 --> 01:30:02,971
I think that was the one
that really sold everybody on it.

1207
01:30:03,050 --> 01:30:08,682
Life flows on
within you and without you...

1208
01:30:16,697 --> 01:30:21,100
Ringo and Paul were constantly saying,
"Go as far as you can."

1209
01:30:21,168 --> 01:30:23,693
"We will stop you. Go as far as you can."

1210
01:30:23,770 --> 01:30:27,797
But there's only so far you can go before
you start completely losing your mind.

1211
01:30:29,009 --> 01:30:30,067
And "Octopus's Garden"...

1212
01:30:30,143 --> 01:30:35,137
I had an idea to put Ringo on his own,
you know, because it's such a...

1213
01:30:35,215 --> 01:30:38,275
To leave his vocal kind of bare.

1214
01:30:38,352 --> 01:30:41,879
(George) We wanted to use
one of Ringo's tracks,

1215
01:30:41,955 --> 01:30:46,688
and the show director was very keen
on using "Octopus's Garden".

1216
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:51,629
We started off with a very orchestral
and dreamy beginning,

1217
01:30:51,698 --> 01:30:56,397
and most people who listened to it
said, "Where did that come from?"

1218
01:30:56,470 --> 01:30:58,904
"That doesn't sound like Beatles to me."

1219
01:30:58,972 --> 01:31:02,499
Well, of course, it was Beatles
and it was something I had scored.

1220
01:31:02,576 --> 01:31:06,774
And we cut up Ringo's voice,

1221
01:31:06,847 --> 01:31:10,681
so that instead of singing the track as it is,

1222
01:31:10,751 --> 01:31:13,618
he does it quite slowly and leisurely
to begin with.

1223
01:31:15,322 --> 01:31:17,654
(Ringo) I'd like to be

1224
01:31:18,892 --> 01:31:21,725
Under the sea

1225
01:31:21,795 --> 01:31:25,629
In an octopus's garden

1226
01:31:25,699 --> 01:31:27,291
In the shade

1227
01:31:30,003 --> 01:31:33,769
- He'd let us in
- ("Yellow Submarine" starts)

1228
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:36,001
Knows where we've been

1229
01:31:36,810 --> 01:31:39,779
In his octopus's garden

1230
01:31:40,714 --> 01:31:42,944
In the shade

1231
01:31:48,755 --> 01:31:52,987
I'd ask my friends to come and see...

1232
01:31:53,060 --> 01:31:55,551
(Giles) Ringo was dead interested in this.

1233
01:31:55,629 --> 01:32:00,066
He'd come in, and I worked in order,
so "Octopus's Garden" hadn't been done.

1234
01:32:00,133 --> 01:32:03,569
He kept saying, "How about
'Octopus's Garden'? You done it yet?"

1235
01:32:03,637 --> 01:32:06,231
He'd come in, and I'd go, "No."

1236
01:32:06,306 --> 01:32:11,710
And so there was this pressure
mounting up. "You go mad on it. Go mad."

1237
01:32:11,778 --> 01:32:16,613
"Don't, you know... Don't skimp
on my song!" It was one of those things.

1238
01:32:16,683 --> 01:32:18,310
And I'm thinking, "Oh, OK."

1239
01:32:18,385 --> 01:32:21,218
So originally I tried
the end of "Glass Onion".

1240
01:32:22,022 --> 01:32:25,458
I put that with his vocal and
actually it sounded too dark and eerie.

1241
01:32:25,525 --> 01:32:30,428
I wanted him on his own - Ringo on
his own - 'cause he's such a character.

1242
01:32:30,497 --> 01:32:34,593
Then I took the strings from "Good Night",
put them up a tone

1243
01:32:34,668 --> 01:32:37,364
and changed the key slightly.

1244
01:32:37,437 --> 01:32:40,406
And, it's funny, it just fitted.

1245
01:32:40,474 --> 01:32:44,069
And I did the whole of "Good Night",
and my dad came in and goes:

1246
01:32:44,144 --> 01:32:48,274
"What are you doing?" I said, "Well,
I thought this might be kind of cool."

1247
01:32:48,348 --> 01:32:53,285
He goes, "Oh, my God!"
He goes - and this was good direction -

1248
01:32:53,353 --> 01:32:57,915
he goes, "But you should
just chop the first verse back in again."

1249
01:32:57,991 --> 01:33:01,825
"Don't play the whole thing."
So there's a bit of a clash going on.

1250
01:33:01,895 --> 01:33:06,798
- The rhythm track to "Octopus's Garden".
- ("Octopus's Garden" plays)

1251
01:33:09,436 --> 01:33:14,169
- It's just very light. And so...
- That's the original?

1252
01:33:14,241 --> 01:33:17,335
That's the original.
So we combined "Lovely Rita".

1253
01:33:17,410 --> 01:33:19,071
(drumbeat)

1254
01:33:19,146 --> 01:33:21,205
Yeah.

1255
01:33:21,281 --> 01:33:23,977
And it's the same groove
'cause it's just Ringo.

1256
01:33:24,050 --> 01:33:27,349
We didn't sample or move anything.

1257
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:32,448
And he's exactly right, too.
It has to be right on the nose.

1258
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:35,988
(Ringo) I'd like to be

1259
01:33:36,062 --> 01:33:38,360
Under the sea...

1260
01:33:39,032 --> 01:33:43,093
(Giles) Because you wanted
the double time in this section here,

1261
01:33:43,170 --> 01:33:45,195
in comes "Polythene Pam".

1262
01:33:45,272 --> 01:33:49,208
(percussion on "Polythene Pam")

1263
01:33:51,478 --> 01:33:54,276
(segues into "Helter Skelter")

1264
01:33:55,849 --> 01:34:00,343
The end goes into "Helter Skelter" - the
guitars and rhythm are "Helter Skelter".

1265
01:34:00,420 --> 01:34:04,083
So I really threw in the kitchen sink.
It finished off with "Sun King".

1266
01:34:04,157 --> 01:34:07,251
I threw everything at that song,
to make Ringo happy.

1267
01:34:07,327 --> 01:34:10,319
I was so nervous when he came.
He knocked on the door

1268
01:34:10,397 --> 01:34:13,662
and opened the door to my studio -
a lot like this one at Abbey Road.

1269
01:34:13,733 --> 01:34:15,894
I played it and I stood in the corner.

1270
01:34:15,969 --> 01:34:21,407
First of all, I thought he had
my voice a little too loud.

1271
01:34:21,474 --> 01:34:25,843
I always tried to hide it a bit.
But it works 'cause it's very pure.

1272
01:34:27,047 --> 01:34:29,379
(Ringo) I'd like to be

1273
01:34:30,483 --> 01:34:32,144
Under the sea...

1274
01:34:32,219 --> 01:34:35,347
When he heard the strings of
"Good Night", his face dropped -

1275
01:34:35,422 --> 01:34:38,482
he's not that keen on his vocal
on "Good Night" apparently,

1276
01:34:38,558 --> 01:34:42,824
so he was delighted
that it didn't happen, and he loved it.

1277
01:34:44,598 --> 01:34:48,534
In an octopus's garden with you

1278
01:34:49,736 --> 01:34:53,263
In an octopus's garden with you

1279
01:35:03,283 --> 01:35:05,945
(intro of "Lady Madonna")

1280
01:35:10,323 --> 01:35:13,190
(Giles) The Beatles did
a lot of amazing psychedelic stuff,

1281
01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:15,990
really heartfelt stuff
and a lot of rock stuff.

1282
01:35:16,062 --> 01:35:20,362
But "Lady Madonna" is slightly more,
I suppose, funky in a way.

1283
01:35:20,433 --> 01:35:25,735
So we got the track up
and I listened to it on four-track.

1284
01:35:25,805 --> 01:35:30,936
What we do is listen to each four-track.
They bounced, so we put them together.

1285
01:35:31,011 --> 01:35:35,072
The first track you hear
when you get it out is this.

1286
01:35:35,148 --> 01:35:37,878
(piano solo on "Lady Madonna")

1287
01:35:43,657 --> 01:35:46,285
- Yeah.
- Which is...

1288
01:35:46,359 --> 01:35:49,522
- I think it's almost boogie-woogie.
- Yeah. It's great.

1289
01:35:49,596 --> 01:35:52,724
And then on top of that, they put this:

1290
01:35:52,799 --> 01:35:57,031
(drum and bass play
on a different channel)

1291
01:35:57,103 --> 01:36:00,504
Obviously listening to themselves
in the cans.

1292
01:36:02,642 --> 01:36:05,543
- If you put them both together...
- (complete version)

1293
01:36:05,612 --> 01:36:09,708
On "Lady Madonna" we departed
from our normal procedure,

1294
01:36:09,783 --> 01:36:14,186
because normally we would lay down
a rhythm track and overdub things on it.

1295
01:36:14,254 --> 01:36:19,282
But this song was piano-driven, really -
Paul on his piano, working away.

1296
01:36:19,359 --> 01:36:22,055
The bass and other things
were added later,

1297
01:36:22,128 --> 01:36:24,460
which was not what we normally did.

1298
01:36:24,531 --> 01:36:28,991
See how they run

1299
01:36:29,069 --> 01:36:33,028
Lady Madonna,
baby at your breast...

1300
01:36:33,106 --> 01:36:37,600
You know, when The Beatles started,
none of them played keyboards at all.

1301
01:36:37,677 --> 01:36:44,549
And when they were successful, I think
Paul got himself a piano first, John later.

1302
01:36:44,617 --> 01:36:50,817
And yet in a very short space of time Paul
became extremely good at playing piano.

1303
01:36:50,890 --> 01:36:53,450
And on "Lady Madonna"
he plays a brilliant piano.

1304
01:36:58,565 --> 01:37:02,797
Lady Madonna,
children at your feet,

1305
01:37:02,869 --> 01:37:07,465
Wonder how you manage
to make ends meet...

1306
01:37:07,540 --> 01:37:10,668
(Giles) I didn't realize that
Paul wrote "Lady Madonna",

1307
01:37:10,744 --> 01:37:13,212
then John wrote "Hey Bulldog"
to compete with it.

1308
01:37:13,279 --> 01:37:16,248
I had no idea
there was this thing going on.

1309
01:37:16,316 --> 01:37:20,810
They're both great piano parts and
it's funny how they just work together.

1310
01:37:21,354 --> 01:37:24,346
So "Bulldog" on its own, which is:

1311
01:37:25,959 --> 01:37:28,928
(instrumental section of "Hey Bulldog")

1312
01:37:31,231 --> 01:37:35,725
I always wanted to get "Hey Bulldog"
in the show 'cause it's such a fantastic riff.

1313
01:37:35,802 --> 01:37:37,702
So put some other tracks in.

1314
01:37:37,771 --> 01:37:41,730
I got it to work in the solo section, and
I thought what would work over the top

1315
01:37:41,808 --> 01:37:46,336
and found that Eric Clapton's guitar solo
from "While My Guitar Gently Weeps"

1316
01:37:46,413 --> 01:37:51,476
complemented it nicely and it just worked.
It took a while to get it all to work.

1317
01:37:51,551 --> 01:37:57,353
I used the organ from "I Want You
(She's So Heavy)" to glue it together.

1318
01:37:57,424 --> 01:38:00,825
(guitar solo
together with "Hey Bulldog")

1319
01:38:00,894 --> 01:38:03,988
- And you hear it sped up.
- (fast-paced guitar)

1320
01:38:04,063 --> 01:38:06,361
Billy Preston was very good but...

1321
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:18,040
There's the "Lady Madonna" vocals...
and the guitar coming in.

1322
01:38:18,111 --> 01:38:21,308
And then back into "Lady Madonna".

1323
01:38:21,381 --> 01:38:24,782
(George) Yeah. It's mixed together nicely.

1324
01:38:25,785 --> 01:38:30,620
(McCartney) You finally hear Ronnie Scott.
The sax player in the middle is Ronnie.

1325
01:38:30,690 --> 01:38:36,253
I knew Ronnie, so I said to him, "Would
you work on this record we're making?"

1326
01:38:36,329 --> 01:38:41,164
"We just need a nice wild... (imitates sax)
Sax solo. You can do that, Ronnie."

1327
01:38:41,234 --> 01:38:43,429
He said, "Yeah, mate, I'll do that."

1328
01:38:43,503 --> 01:38:49,203
So he came along to the session,
played it great, but in the mix we buried it.

1329
01:38:49,275 --> 01:38:53,541
I met up with him weeks later after and
he'd heard it on the radio or somewhere.

1330
01:38:53,613 --> 01:38:58,050
He said, "What did you do to my solo?"
I said, "Sorry, Ronnie. It's pop."

1331
01:38:58,117 --> 01:39:02,247
"This isn't jazz. It's a different thing.
It still sounds good, Ron, great."

1332
01:39:02,322 --> 01:39:05,450
But he was always a bit pissed at...
you know. "What are you doing?"

1333
01:39:05,525 --> 01:39:08,551
So now finally in the show,
at the end of "Lady Madonna",

1334
01:39:08,628 --> 01:39:11,096
you suddenly hear... (imitates sax)

1335
01:39:11,164 --> 01:39:13,155
So he's not with us anymore,

1336
01:39:13,233 --> 01:39:17,795
but he would have been pleased
to finally be revealed in all his glory.

1337
01:39:18,171 --> 01:39:20,503
(sax solo)

1338
01:39:21,341 --> 01:39:23,172
(applause and cheering)

1339
01:39:24,844 --> 01:39:27,335
("Strawberry Fields")

1340
01:39:34,687 --> 01:39:39,215
Let me take you down
'cause I'm going to...

1341
01:39:39,292 --> 01:39:43,092
(George) "Strawberry Fields",
I thought, would be difficult to handle

1342
01:39:43,162 --> 01:39:49,965
because it's one of my favorite tracks
and it's also a kind of icon too.

1343
01:39:50,036 --> 01:39:53,233
It's something which
many people would say:

1344
01:39:53,306 --> 01:39:56,469
"Don't ever touch it.
That is sacrosanct."

1345
01:39:58,545 --> 01:40:03,847
No one I think is in my tree...

1346
01:40:03,917 --> 01:40:07,512
(Giles) Yoko had some tapes from home,
from John's house,

1347
01:40:07,587 --> 01:40:10,215
with him doing early versions of
"Strawberry Fields".

1348
01:40:10,290 --> 01:40:11,985
(George) No one had heard this bit.

1349
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:15,951
So this is him at home.

1350
01:40:18,364 --> 01:40:23,529
(Lennon) No one I think is in my tree...

1351
01:40:23,603 --> 01:40:27,437
(Giles) So what we did is we took
all of the versions we could find

1352
01:40:27,507 --> 01:40:31,102
and tried to combine them
in one long, expansive song

1353
01:40:31,177 --> 01:40:35,011
that just starts off at home
and finishes in the studio.

1354
01:40:35,081 --> 01:40:38,608
That is I think it's not too bad...

1355
01:40:38,685 --> 01:40:42,815
And while I swanned around,
you tuned all of the...

1356
01:40:42,889 --> 01:40:47,189
You pitch-shifted on the tape machine,
like in the old days, all the versions

1357
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:49,194
so they're all in the same key.

1358
01:40:49,262 --> 01:40:53,722
(George) It was near enough, but not
near enough for what we were doing.

1359
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:59,702
Living is easy with eyes closed

1360
01:40:59,772 --> 01:41:03,765
Misunderstanding all you see...

1361
01:41:03,843 --> 01:41:07,745
(Yoko) This show has to be something -
especially John's songs -

1362
01:41:07,814 --> 01:41:10,612
had to be something
that John would be proud of.

1363
01:41:10,683 --> 01:41:18,783
That was my concern, in the sense that
the spirit of the songs will come out well.

1364
01:41:18,858 --> 01:41:21,190
Nothing is real

1365
01:41:22,095 --> 01:41:25,087
And nothing to get hung about

1366
01:41:26,099 --> 01:41:29,125
Strawberry fields forever...

1367
01:41:35,041 --> 01:41:41,071
So now this is the final version -
the final four-track that was done.

1368
01:41:42,915 --> 01:41:46,874
I think I know I mean yes,
but it's all wrong

1369
01:41:46,953 --> 01:41:50,787
(George) Which is like the master, so...

1370
01:41:50,857 --> 01:41:53,451
(end of "Strawberry Fields")

1371
01:41:56,062 --> 01:41:58,690
(Giles) So we used this drumbeat
as a foundation

1372
01:41:58,765 --> 01:42:02,826
'cause the song was faded in and out,
and we still used everything that's there.

1373
01:42:02,902 --> 01:42:07,134
They faded in and out because, of course,
in those days we had no click tracks

1374
01:42:07,206 --> 01:42:09,436
to keep us in synch.

1375
01:42:09,509 --> 01:42:14,173
And, in fact, the rhythm went
completely haywire at one point.

1376
01:42:14,247 --> 01:42:16,681
But there was a bit after it
I wanted to include.

1377
01:42:16,749 --> 01:42:20,446
I couldn't edit them together,
so the only thing I did on the mix

1378
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:25,355
was to dip them down to nothing,
with the bit that was wobbly,

1379
01:42:25,425 --> 01:42:27,086
then bring them back again.

1380
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:31,028
So everybody said, "Great idea -
fading, then coming back."

1381
01:42:31,097 --> 01:42:35,466
I didn't tell them the reason,
but now we don't need to do that.

1382
01:42:35,535 --> 01:42:39,335
(instrumental section
of "Strawberry Fields")

1383
01:42:44,110 --> 01:42:47,341
We should run through
the separate elements,

1384
01:42:47,413 --> 01:42:51,975
and the first thing we hear
is "Hey Bulldog", very quietly.

1385
01:42:52,719 --> 01:42:56,621
- And "In My Life".
- (piano solo on "In My Life")

1386
01:42:56,689 --> 01:42:59,852
- And "Penny Lane".
- (trumpet solo on "Penny Lane")

1387
01:43:02,328 --> 01:43:04,489
All happening with the...

1388
01:43:07,533 --> 01:43:09,524
And "Piggies" comes in.

1389
01:43:15,908 --> 01:43:22,279
Meanwhile, we have the whole rhythm
from "Strawberry Fields" at the end.

1390
01:43:24,684 --> 01:43:26,743
And "Hello Goodbye".

1391
01:43:27,820 --> 01:43:33,258
Hela, heba, helloa...

1392
01:43:33,326 --> 01:43:36,818
I think, because The Beatles
had so many musical ideas,

1393
01:43:36,896 --> 01:43:38,955
that often they work together.

1394
01:43:39,031 --> 01:43:44,025
They're so sort of melodic
in what they did, that it's amazing how...

1395
01:43:44,103 --> 01:43:48,039
It's the same brain,
it's just wedged together.

1396
01:43:48,107 --> 01:43:51,873
(Yoko) There's no other Beatles
in the world. It's one and only.

1397
01:43:51,944 --> 01:43:54,879
The Beatles were like
acrobatics of the mind,

1398
01:43:54,947 --> 01:43:58,940
and Cirque du Soleil
is the acrobatics of the body.

1399
01:43:59,018 --> 01:44:01,384
And so when it comes together,

1400
01:44:01,454 --> 01:44:06,551
it makes a kind of... something
that's whole. I like that, yeah.

1401
01:44:06,626 --> 01:44:09,220
("Baby, You Can Drive My Car")

1402
01:44:10,897 --> 01:44:14,697
Asked a girl
what she wanted to be

1403
01:44:14,767 --> 01:44:17,634
She said, baby, can't you see...

1404
01:44:17,703 --> 01:44:19,728
(Giles) No one has done this before.

1405
01:44:19,806 --> 01:44:24,800
No one has gone to their own library
and used themselves.

1406
01:44:24,877 --> 01:44:28,244
It's great The Beatles have done this first.
Others will do it,

1407
01:44:28,314 --> 01:44:31,943
and I hope people like the results
that have come from it.

1408
01:44:32,018 --> 01:44:36,011
(McCartney) There will be people who are
purist and want to hear it as it was.

1409
01:44:36,088 --> 01:44:38,818
And you know what? It exists as it was.

1410
01:44:38,891 --> 01:44:41,860
So, you know, just play your vinyl.

1411
01:44:41,928 --> 01:44:46,297
And I think that's great.
That is how it was.

1412
01:44:46,365 --> 01:44:49,027
But obviously,
by allowing it to happen,

1413
01:44:49,101 --> 01:44:52,366
we don't have a problem
with the remix aspect.

1414
01:44:53,506 --> 01:44:58,307
(George) We're talking about probably
the most important popular music

1415
01:44:58,377 --> 01:45:00,277
of the 20th century,

1416
01:45:00,346 --> 01:45:03,179
and it's historic what we're dealing with.

1417
01:45:03,249 --> 01:45:08,380
Of course, over a period of 90 minutes
we can get in a lot of songs

1418
01:45:08,454 --> 01:45:11,617
which are icons,
which are wonderful.

1419
01:45:11,691 --> 01:45:14,819
And when you hear them in a big room

1420
01:45:14,894 --> 01:45:19,991
with what we've been able to do with them
in surround sound,

1421
01:45:20,066 --> 01:45:22,830
I think you'll have a few shivers
going down your spine.

1422
01:46:19,546 --> 01:46:22,538
("Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite")

1423
01:46:25,619 --> 01:46:30,249
Yeah, it's great.
I think that Lennon's voice all over,

1424
01:46:30,323 --> 01:46:33,292
- it sounds very good.
- (George) You're happy with it?

1425
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:34,850
Yeah. What about you?

1426
01:46:34,928 --> 01:46:38,955
I'd like to be able to hear the voice nearer,
without being louder.

1427
01:46:39,032 --> 01:46:43,264
We can certainly play with that,
see if we can, without increasing the level,

1428
01:46:43,336 --> 01:46:46,999
bring it closer by using the center
speakers on the back of the chair.

1429
01:46:47,074 --> 01:46:52,341
When we did the 5.1, I think
we put a slight slap on him as well,

1430
01:46:52,412 --> 01:46:56,371
and that may just make him boom
a bit more.

1431
01:46:56,450 --> 01:46:59,851
He doesn't sound like he's a ringmaster.

1432
01:47:01,088 --> 01:47:06,287
I fear, with the experience, people thinking
The Beatles are selling out to Las Vegas.

1433
01:47:06,359 --> 01:47:10,659
I think Las Vegas...
There's a lot of money in Las Vegas!

1434
01:47:10,730 --> 01:47:14,359
You can do things in Las Vegas
you can't do anywhere else in the world.

1435
01:47:14,434 --> 01:47:18,370
Even The Beatles couldn't build
a $100m theater

1436
01:47:18,438 --> 01:47:20,065
to put their music into

1437
01:47:20,140 --> 01:47:22,540
which has 6,000 speakers inside.

1438
01:47:22,609 --> 01:47:25,737
- So each section has its own sound?
- Its own sound, yeah.

1439
01:47:25,812 --> 01:47:27,905
You get a little spill from...

1440
01:47:27,981 --> 01:47:33,044
The idea of working with The Beatles'
music is something that is unbelievable.

1441
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:36,453
It's unbelievable because I grew up...

1442
01:47:36,523 --> 01:47:41,119
That generation was my generation,
and I know The Beatles' music inside out.

1443
01:47:41,194 --> 01:47:45,790
So the idea of working with
The Beatles' music is just fantastic.

1444
01:47:45,866 --> 01:47:49,927
("La Marseillaise" opening
of "All You Need Is Love")

1445
01:47:54,107 --> 01:47:57,270
Love, love, love

1446
01:47:58,512 --> 01:48:01,413
Love, love, love...

1447
01:48:01,481 --> 01:48:05,383
(Deans) We started as a proscenium
theater, then it went to a 360 theater.

1448
01:48:05,452 --> 01:48:09,286
So now the whole auditorium
was around the stage,

1449
01:48:09,356 --> 01:48:13,793
which for me, as a sound designer,
it's like: Where do you put the speakers?

1450
01:48:15,128 --> 01:48:20,156
(Giles) There's left and right,
as you have at home - The Beatles stereo.

1451
01:48:20,233 --> 01:48:23,600
Then we have a speaker in the seat -
we can have this voice up close.

1452
01:48:23,670 --> 01:48:25,763
We have a speaker 80 feet away.

1453
01:48:25,839 --> 01:48:28,137
You can have strings or you can have...

1454
01:48:28,208 --> 01:48:31,075
We have speakers in the ears -
they're three inches away.

1455
01:48:31,144 --> 01:48:37,344
So my idea is to almost feel like you're
dropping someone into a Beatles studio

1456
01:48:37,417 --> 01:48:40,716
where they're
surrounding you completely.

1457
01:48:40,787 --> 01:48:45,349
- So I'll hear these two and this?
- Plus you'll hear...

1458
01:48:45,425 --> 01:48:47,916
The subs for these are in the ceiling.

1459
01:48:47,994 --> 01:48:52,863
And then you have what's behind, like
what we saw downstairs, what's behind,

1460
01:48:52,933 --> 01:48:57,336
what's in front and then the main PA
as well. And then we can move sound...

1461
01:48:57,404 --> 01:49:01,306
- I can't hear a word, mate! Sorry.
- ("Hey Jude" plays loudly)

1462
01:49:01,374 --> 01:49:04,832
(all laugh as McCartney mouths words)

1463
01:49:07,814 --> 01:49:12,717
(Deans) The kind of work I do,
I like for the audience to be enveloped.

1464
01:49:12,786 --> 01:49:17,382
I like for the audience
to be a part of the show.

1465
01:49:17,457 --> 01:49:21,416
And I'm not trying to do it so people go,
"Oh, there's sound around me."

1466
01:49:21,494 --> 01:49:27,194
It should just belong. It should be
as one unified joint production.

1467
01:49:27,267 --> 01:49:30,293
("Hey Jude" carries on playing)

1468
01:49:30,370 --> 01:49:34,204
- I know this song. Yeah.
- Takes a little time, but...

1469
01:49:34,274 --> 01:49:37,243
- Good singer. Who's this?
- We're trying to find out.

1470
01:49:37,310 --> 01:49:39,301
- French guy?
- Yeah!

1471
01:49:39,379 --> 01:49:40,539
Thought so.

1472
01:49:40,614 --> 01:49:43,242
OK, let's move on.

1473
01:49:43,316 --> 01:49:47,685
("La Marseillaise" opening
of "All You Need Is Love")

1474
01:49:47,754 --> 01:49:49,745
Here we go!

1475
01:49:51,591 --> 01:49:54,788
Love, love, love...

1476
01:49:54,861 --> 01:49:58,820
(Giles) I've seen a lot of shows in Vegas
and they sound very good,

1477
01:49:58,898 --> 01:50:02,891
but they don't sound... English!

1478
01:50:04,404 --> 01:50:07,032
I don't mean that in a nasty way at all -
it's great -

1479
01:50:07,107 --> 01:50:09,871
but I think The Beatles
should sound like The Beatles.

1480
01:50:11,344 --> 01:50:14,472
Me and Paul are pretty good
at getting that done.

1481
01:50:14,547 --> 01:50:18,677
Paul Hicks is... Funnily enough,
he's Tony Hicks' son from The Hollies.

1482
01:50:18,752 --> 01:50:20,743
There was a band called The Hollies.

1483
01:50:20,820 --> 01:50:25,917
I've only worked with "son-ofs" - that's the
most important thing: "Who's your dad?"

1484
01:50:25,992 --> 01:50:31,430
He's been at Abbey Road for a long time,
so we'll be here mixing in the theater.

1485
01:50:31,498 --> 01:50:36,367
- I was going backwards and forwards.
- There's too much sub going on.

1486
01:50:36,436 --> 01:50:38,927
(George) Cirque du Soleil
has never had a show

1487
01:50:39,005 --> 01:50:43,135
where the music has been
entirely on tape or on recording.

1488
01:50:43,209 --> 01:50:45,643
They've always had live musicians.

1489
01:50:45,712 --> 01:50:50,775
And they were scared, because
what happens if something goes wrong?

1490
01:50:50,850 --> 01:50:54,911
You know, if a guy hurts himself
and we have to fill in time.

1491
01:50:54,988 --> 01:50:59,721
So we've had to make our music
continuous,

1492
01:50:59,793 --> 01:51:04,127
but, at the same time,
we've had to have flexibility within it.

1493
01:51:04,197 --> 01:51:09,032
There are a lot of places where
you can stretch the music a little bit.

1494
01:51:09,102 --> 01:51:12,765
Or, if it comes to really dire straits,

1495
01:51:12,839 --> 01:51:19,267
then the operator will be able to loop
a particular section and keep it going.

1496
01:51:19,346 --> 01:51:22,679
("Help!" comes to an end)

1497
01:51:25,218 --> 01:51:27,880
(man) On normal Cirque shows -
other Cirque shows -

1498
01:51:27,954 --> 01:51:31,822
the music is written
in the creative process of the show itself.

1499
01:51:31,891 --> 01:51:35,759
And so that way the music
is also eligible to be changed

1500
01:51:35,829 --> 01:51:38,320
over the course of the show
from minute to minute.

1501
01:51:38,398 --> 01:51:42,994
Here, once a song starts
that the whole audience knows,

1502
01:51:43,069 --> 01:51:48,006
you don't want to mess with it,
and we don't want to mess with it either.

1503
01:51:49,008 --> 01:51:50,999
("Here Comes The Sun")

1504
01:51:51,077 --> 01:51:52,738
Little darling

1505
01:51:52,812 --> 01:51:56,873
It's been a long, cold, lonely winter

1506
01:51:58,451 --> 01:51:59,440
Little darling...

1507
01:51:59,519 --> 01:52:02,818
(George) We're playing back
in 5.1 surround,

1508
01:52:02,889 --> 01:52:07,053
which is quite a different experience
to stereo or mono.

1509
01:52:07,127 --> 01:52:09,459
I love it. I think it's great.

1510
01:52:09,529 --> 01:52:13,522
And it gives you another dimension
to the music.

1511
01:52:15,969 --> 01:52:20,406
Hela, heba, helloa...

1512
01:52:20,473 --> 01:52:23,806
(Whiteley) Because so many
of the songs stay the same,

1513
01:52:23,877 --> 01:52:27,438
projections are heavily synchronized
to the music.

1514
01:52:27,514 --> 01:52:30,005
Lighting punches
happen at the exact same time,

1515
01:52:30,083 --> 01:52:35,419
so, from here, we're spitting out numbers
those departments can synchronize too.

1516
01:52:35,488 --> 01:52:37,479
We've done a lot of preparation.

1517
01:52:37,557 --> 01:52:41,550
There's no other Cirque show
with so many elements so tied together

1518
01:52:41,628 --> 01:52:44,563
because they've never had
the music established

1519
01:52:44,631 --> 01:52:47,361
40 years before the show was created,
like this one.

1520
01:52:47,434 --> 01:52:51,200
- (George) They'll have a playback?
- (man) That's the first time for them

1521
01:52:51,271 --> 01:52:54,331
- to hear the real thing.
- I hope they like it.

1522
01:52:54,407 --> 01:52:57,570
Because in the rehearsal room
we have commercial versions.

1523
01:52:57,644 --> 01:53:02,138
And even then they haven't heard it
like you and I have heard it.

1524
01:53:02,582 --> 01:53:04,846
We'll play you the opening of the show.

1525
01:53:04,918 --> 01:53:07,409
To explain what we've done
with the music is,

1526
01:53:07,487 --> 01:53:14,359
all of the music for the show is basically
chopped Beatles stuff from all their tapes

1527
01:53:14,427 --> 01:53:21,162
that my dad, who's here now,
recorded from 1962 to '69 onwards.

1528
01:53:21,234 --> 01:53:22,826
(cheering)

1529
01:53:24,904 --> 01:53:27,668
(George) We're embarking on
a new direction here.

1530
01:53:27,740 --> 01:53:32,006
The sounds we are getting are not
the sounds you would get in a studio.

1531
01:53:32,078 --> 01:53:34,069
It's a different thing altogether.

1532
01:53:34,147 --> 01:53:40,780
It's sounds that are designed to enhance
the visuals and make the show exciting.

1533
01:53:40,854 --> 01:53:43,982
("Get Back" starts up/audience cheers)

1534
01:53:44,057 --> 01:53:47,584
Jojo was a man
who thought he was a loner

1535
01:53:47,660 --> 01:53:50,993
But he knew it couldn't last

1536
01:53:51,631 --> 01:53:55,294
Jojo left his home
in Tucson, Arizona

1537
01:53:55,368 --> 01:53:58,030
For some California grass

1538
01:53:59,072 --> 01:54:00,835
Get back

1539
01:54:00,974 --> 01:54:02,771
Get back

1540
01:54:02,842 --> 01:54:06,278
Get back
to where you once belonged

1541
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:08,313
Get back

1542
01:54:08,848 --> 01:54:10,679
Get back...

1543
01:54:10,750 --> 01:54:15,619
When I heard the show in Las Vegas
and heard the sound quality,

1544
01:54:15,688 --> 01:54:18,987
I was blown away,
'cause I'm listening and thinking,

1545
01:54:19,058 --> 01:54:22,425
"Wow, that snare drum!
I can't believe it!"

1546
01:54:22,495 --> 01:54:27,194
It's just so clear, it's so original.
You just don't hear snare drums like that.

1547
01:54:27,267 --> 01:54:30,168
("Glass Onion")

1548
01:54:31,871 --> 01:54:33,862
Oh, yeah

1549
01:54:35,608 --> 01:54:37,599
Oh, yeah

1550
01:54:39,612 --> 01:54:41,978
Oh, yeah!

1551
01:55:27,135 --> 01:55:31,731
("La Marseillaise" opening
of "All You Need Is Love")

1552
01:55:33,808 --> 01:55:37,209
(man) I remember clearly when
we decided with Dominic Champagne

1553
01:55:37,278 --> 01:55:39,769
to work in 360 degrees.

1554
01:55:39,847 --> 01:55:47,276
For me it was impossible to see the show
in an Italian way of seeing a show -

1555
01:55:47,355 --> 01:55:52,122
I mean, from being outside the frame
of the theater.

1556
01:55:52,794 --> 01:55:56,753
It's very difficult.
It's a nightmare to work like that.

1557
01:55:56,831 --> 01:56:01,825
For the light, for the video, for the stage,
for the artists, it's very, very tough.

1558
01:56:01,903 --> 01:56:05,703
All the exits of the stage
are inside the audience.

1559
01:56:05,773 --> 01:56:10,176
Also, even the video projections
are in the audience.

1560
01:56:10,244 --> 01:56:15,147
And it's very important because it means
the audience can have the feeling

1561
01:56:15,216 --> 01:56:19,915
that they are inside the show
and can live an experience.

1562
01:56:21,956 --> 01:56:24,584
(man #2) The challenge is
to use those screens

1563
01:56:24,659 --> 01:56:34,330
as something who places you not outside
of the scene, but inside the stage.

1564
01:56:36,070 --> 01:56:41,667
My approach is more working with
optical effect, natural effect.

1565
01:56:41,742 --> 01:56:46,441
It's always better
if I can shoot what I have to do,

1566
01:56:46,514 --> 01:56:51,975
and then, of course, I put filters,
I composite and everything.

1567
01:56:52,053 --> 01:57:02,952
But my first material, the roots are
always better if I do it like a handcrafter.

1568
01:57:03,030 --> 01:57:05,362
And I'm sure of that.

1569
01:57:05,433 --> 01:57:07,264
- It must be all right.
- OK, let's go.

1570
01:57:07,335 --> 01:57:09,235
- Don't, John.
- Sorry.

1571
01:57:11,305 --> 01:57:12,897
- (McCartney) OK?
- (Lennon) Yes.

1572
01:57:12,974 --> 01:57:14,805
(McCartney) Now!

1573
01:57:14,876 --> 01:57:18,107
- (Lennon) Yes, sir, that's my baby!
- (McCartney) Straight away.

1574
01:57:18,179 --> 01:57:20,374
- (Lennon) We'll do this again.
- OK. Go!

1575
01:57:20,448 --> 01:57:22,712
(Lennon) Sorry. I feel less than useless...

1576
01:57:22,783 --> 01:57:30,121
Apple Corps gave to Cirque all those
recording sessions between '63 and '69,

1577
01:57:30,191 --> 01:57:32,955
during which The Beatles
were recording their songs,

1578
01:57:33,027 --> 01:57:36,258
with which I could make a montage.

1579
01:57:38,232 --> 01:57:41,463
(McCartney) Are we still
recording even now?

1580
01:57:41,535 --> 01:57:46,302
(Lennon) No, I don't think so.
You're not being funny, are you?

1581
01:57:46,374 --> 01:57:51,539
- I can hear voices talking.
- (Ringo) Nobody was listening.

1582
01:57:51,612 --> 01:57:53,011
(moaning)

1583
01:57:53,080 --> 01:57:59,542
(Lennon) I get something in me head and
all the walls of Rome couldn't stop me.

1584
01:57:59,620 --> 01:58:07,220
They had a great sense of humor. That's
what I tried to show with this montage.

1585
01:58:07,295 --> 01:58:11,857
- (Lennon) Paul, it's very hard to sing this.
- (Ringo) Do I love you!

1586
01:58:11,933 --> 01:58:13,093
Ringo, stop!

1587
01:58:13,167 --> 01:58:19,072
Of course, I had to sign so many papers
to promise I won't sell it over the net!

1588
01:58:19,140 --> 01:58:24,373
But for a year and a half
it was such a terrific experience.

1589
01:58:24,445 --> 01:58:28,506
- Let's get this show on the road.
- (Lennon) OK, George. Go ahead.

1590
01:58:28,582 --> 01:58:33,747
This is the greatest band in the world
and you can hear them work together.

1591
01:58:33,821 --> 01:58:37,188
And it's clear as if it was now.

1592
01:58:40,795 --> 01:58:43,696
(man, in French)
I think their effect was universal.

1593
01:58:43,764 --> 01:58:48,633
Their arrival turned the world upside
down, seduced it and revolutionized it,

1594
01:58:48,703 --> 01:58:50,694
and it was the same everywhere.

1595
01:58:50,771 --> 01:58:52,796
("Revolution")

1596
01:58:58,813 --> 01:59:02,544
You say you want a revolution

1597
01:59:02,616 --> 01:59:04,709
Well, you know...

1598
01:59:04,785 --> 01:59:08,186
I started making costumes
at the age of eight.

1599
01:59:08,255 --> 01:59:11,349
I like to give the impression

1600
01:59:11,425 --> 01:59:15,156
that the character
comes from an unknown world

1601
01:59:15,229 --> 01:59:18,426
but, by the details in the costume,

1602
01:59:18,499 --> 01:59:21,730
by the manner in which
he or she moves,

1603
01:59:21,802 --> 01:59:25,898
give the impression that that world exists
and the character is a part of it.

1604
01:59:27,041 --> 01:59:31,137
(woman) So this is all costumes
from the presentation.

1605
01:59:31,212 --> 01:59:32,543
(applause)

1606
01:59:32,613 --> 01:59:36,105
There are references to
absolutely loads of names,

1607
01:59:36,183 --> 01:59:38,777
like Michelle, Polythene Pam,

1608
01:59:38,853 --> 01:59:42,812
Sugarplum Fairy,
Father McKenzie, Lady Madonna.

1609
01:59:42,890 --> 01:59:46,690
There's an entire universe,
an entire population of people, really,

1610
01:59:46,761 --> 01:59:51,721
who exist most probably in
the imaginations of thousands of people,

1611
01:59:51,799 --> 01:59:55,929
because there were thousands of people
worldwide who listened to The Beatles.

1612
01:59:56,003 --> 02:00:02,704
So we had an enormous responsibility in
portraying these characters in the show.

1613
02:00:02,777 --> 02:00:05,644
All the lonely people

1614
02:00:05,713 --> 02:00:08,705
Where do they all belong?

1615
02:00:10,151 --> 02:00:12,142
(woman) I have two favorite props.

1616
02:00:12,219 --> 02:00:17,213
The first one is Eleanor Rigby's train
because it's really made from junk parts.

1617
02:00:17,291 --> 02:00:23,628
So it's really made from antiques,
so it has a real life. It's not newly made.

1618
02:00:23,697 --> 02:00:25,528
This one carries a lot of...

1619
02:00:25,599 --> 02:00:29,296
I remember each part of this train,
where I buy it.

1620
02:00:29,370 --> 02:00:33,500
The other one is Sgt Pepper's bundle
'cause I think it's so...

1621
02:00:33,574 --> 02:00:37,340
Because it's a sphere, it's like
he's carrying the world on his back.

1622
02:00:37,411 --> 02:00:40,608
It's very poetic, I think, this image.

1623
02:00:41,615 --> 02:00:45,176
Dominic is a prop-consuming guy.

1624
02:00:45,252 --> 02:00:52,021
I heard in previous Cirque shows a lot of
things were sent to the Cirque warehouse.

1625
02:00:52,093 --> 02:00:58,259
But on this show, I think I have two or
three major props who were cut. That's it.

1626
02:00:58,332 --> 02:01:02,063
And there are more than 600 props
on this show.

1627
02:01:02,136 --> 02:01:05,435
And every day he's asking for more -
he's still asking for more.

1628
02:01:05,506 --> 02:01:10,205
I'll continue to feed him because I like
that my work is so integrated in this show.

1629
02:01:16,050 --> 02:01:19,042
Dominic is a guy
who puts a lot of stuff on stage.

1630
02:01:19,120 --> 02:01:25,582
We are both big hockey fans,
so we have a kind of a language.

1631
02:01:25,659 --> 02:01:29,288
We have one puck, OK?
So where's the puck now?

1632
02:01:29,363 --> 02:01:35,666
I have to put the audience
to help them to focus, to follow the story.

1633
02:01:35,736 --> 02:01:42,904
Sometimes we have two pucks, but we try
to keep the game at one puck on the ice!

1634
02:01:42,977 --> 02:01:45,537
But it's a big, big challenge.

1635
02:01:45,613 --> 02:01:50,141
And after that, I have to express myself
artistically, you know,

1636
02:01:50,217 --> 02:01:54,051
with colors, with emotion
in relation to the music,

1637
02:01:54,121 --> 02:01:58,148
with rhythm, with beat,
with counter beat,

1638
02:01:58,225 --> 02:02:01,319
with a big "Whoo!"

1639
02:02:01,395 --> 02:02:03,727
And I like to, you know...

1640
02:02:03,797 --> 02:02:07,563
"Lucy In The Sky",
it's a song that I like visually

1641
02:02:07,635 --> 02:02:10,001
because I put a lot of hours on that,

1642
02:02:10,070 --> 02:02:15,337
but with some other songs I'm more
laid-back and just install a nice ambiance.

1643
02:02:15,409 --> 02:02:19,812
That means that
we recreate a place, a space.

1644
02:02:19,880 --> 02:02:22,678
Woke up, got out of bed

1645
02:02:22,750 --> 02:02:26,083
Dragged a comb across my head...

1646
02:02:26,153 --> 02:02:29,316
Those tracks have been recorded
40 years ago,

1647
02:02:29,390 --> 02:02:34,589
and everything that I discover with
the lyrics and the way they were writing

1648
02:02:34,662 --> 02:02:36,892
and the sense of humor they had...

1649
02:02:36,964 --> 02:02:39,489
They were four guys, you know?

1650
02:02:39,567 --> 02:02:44,903
That's what I'd like people to remember
when they come and see the show.

1651
02:02:44,972 --> 02:02:47,463
("Glass Onion")

1652
02:02:48,842 --> 02:02:51,072
Oh, yeah

1653
02:02:52,980 --> 02:02:55,312
Oh, yeah...

1654
02:02:56,217 --> 02:03:00,449
(man) The first time I get inside
the Abbey Road Studio

1655
02:03:00,521 --> 02:03:06,619
I was thinking about all the archives
that I was supposed to check.

1656
02:03:07,027 --> 02:03:10,087
So many pictures.

1657
02:03:10,164 --> 02:03:16,660
I spent a week, ten hours a day,
watching The Beatles.

1658
02:03:16,737 --> 02:03:19,604
And finally, I had this flash.

1659
02:03:19,673 --> 02:03:26,909
I was like, "We don't want to be
documentary with our concept."

1660
02:03:26,981 --> 02:03:30,940
"We want to bring the people
inside their universe."

1661
02:03:31,018 --> 02:03:37,981
"So why don't we use all the pictures
to create one picture?"

1662
02:03:38,058 --> 02:03:40,049
Finally it's a little movie,

1663
02:03:40,127 --> 02:03:43,824
so you have thousands of movies
inside the image,

1664
02:03:43,897 --> 02:03:46,832
like a kaleidoscope of their life.

1665
02:03:46,900 --> 02:03:49,266
("All You Need Is Love")

1666
02:03:50,604 --> 02:03:53,368
(refrain) Love is all you need...

1667
02:04:29,977 --> 02:04:33,504
(McCartney) Right, fade it there, Charlie.

1668
02:04:33,580 --> 02:04:35,571
OK, put the red light off.

1669
02:04:35,649 --> 02:04:39,813
(Lennon) This is Johnny Rhythm saying
good night to yous and God bless yous.

1670
02:04:39,887 --> 02:04:41,980
(applause and laughter)

1671
02:04:42,305 --> 02:04:48,472
