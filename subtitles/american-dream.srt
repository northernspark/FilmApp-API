MAN: As President Reagan
was preparing to deliver

4
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:33,058
his weekly radio address
from Camp David,

5
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:34,889
he ad-libbed

PRESIDENT REAGAN:
My fellow Americans,

9
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:43,067
I've talked to you
about the economic problems

10
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,798
and opportunities
our nation faces.

11

I'm prepared to tell you
it's a hell of mess.

12
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,535
The hard line being taken
by the Reagan administration

13
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,077
concerning
the air controllers strike...

The Supreme Court delivered
a potentially staggering setback

to labor unions.

16
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:57,976
It comes at a time
when union officials

no.

when Hormel treated us decent.

Why do you stay at

00:11:00,392 --> 00:11:03,225
that I think I must have
for the welfare

156
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,627
of the long-term future
of the company,

157
00:11:05,697 --> 00:11:09,189
that would say,
"We can do no more."

158
00:11:09,267 --> 00:11:12,794
If Jay Hormel were here today,
if George A. Hormel were here,

159
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:15,806
they probably would be doing
exactly the same thing

160
00:11:15,874 --> 00:11:17,398
that we are.

161
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:28,649
I think unions are getting
their teeth kicked in.

162
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,951
I think if you're
into a situation

163
00:11:32,023 --> 00:11:34,082
of where you're getting beat up,

164
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:36,559
you better try
something different.

165
00:11:36,628 --> 00:11:40,029
MAN: Corporate campaigns
initiated by Ray Rogers...

166
00:11:40,098 --> 00:11:41,588
MAN #2: Rogers
has been used to targeting

167
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:42,894
one enemy, the employer.

168
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:45,300
MAN #3: Rogers brought
his Corporate Campaign here...

169
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:49,101
JIM: We were very ineffective
in communicating our message.

170
00:11:49,174 --> 00:11:50,903
MAN #4:
He managed to attract reporters

171
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,967
from the "New York Times,"
the "Chicago Tribune"...

172
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:56,946
JIM: I ran across an article on
Ray Rogers and gave him a call.

173
00:11:57,015 --> 00:11:58,812
MAN #5: Tough-talking
labor consultant...

174
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,717
JIM: He said he needed
to do a little research

175
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:04,255
because he was a vegetarian,

176
00:12:04,322 --> 00:12:06,882
didn't know anything
about meatpacking.

177
00:12:10,395 --> 00:12:13,796
Ray came and made a
presentation to our membership.

178
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:20,099
RAY: We will run
a multimillion dollar campaign

179
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:24,438
even though you don't
have millions of dollars.

180
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:27,501
The greatest resource,
the greatest strength you have

181
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:30,047
is the people themselves.

182
00:12:30,115 --> 00:12:32,083
And that's why
we feel so confident

183
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,550
that we can pull off
a major victory,

184
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:36,814
not just for Local P-9
in Austin,

185
00:12:36,888 --> 00:12:39,584
but for labor
throughout this entire country.

186
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,516
- Congratulations, partner.
- Yeah.

187
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,953
The price of poker just went up.

188
00:13:11,022 --> 00:13:14,583
In this game, because that's
the way the company views it.

189
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:17,992
It's a game the way
they want to treat people,

190
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,554
hold their whole lives
in jeopardy.

191
00:13:20,632 --> 00:13:23,157
And to them, it might be a game.

192
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:26,636
And to us, it's a war.

193
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:28,673
Things can really
start moving now.

194
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,732
Super.
That's just really nice.

195
00:13:32,777 --> 00:13:36,269
And we hope that the corporate
executives from Hormel come.

196
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,714
We hope the executives
from the bank come.

197
00:13:38,783 --> 00:13:41,274
We want everybody to see
the type of program

198
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:42,581
that we plan on running

199
00:13:42,654 --> 00:13:46,090
and then let them begin
to lose the night's sleep

200
00:13:46,157 --> 00:13:49,991
like they've caused
this community to lose sleep.

201
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:52,858
[ Chanting ]
We're gonna win!

202
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:55,331
We're gonna win!
We're gonna win!

203
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,426
We're gonna win!
We're gonna win!

204
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:08,172
RAY: On our staff,
we have experts in all facets

205
00:14:08,246 --> 00:14:11,773
of research and analysis,
communications experts,

206
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,875
and experts in all facets

207
00:14:13,952 --> 00:14:15,715
of political
and community organization.

208
00:14:15,787 --> 00:14:19,314
We looked out there in society
and saw poor and working people

209
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,722
getting the daylights
kicked out of them.

210
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:24,319
We felt there had to be
a mechanism that they and unions

211
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:25,988
and community groups
could turn to

212
00:14:26,064 --> 00:14:28,965
that had a lot of expertise
in how to challenge

213
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,093
powerful adversaries
that were irresponsible

214
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:32,796
in the policies
directed at workers.

215
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:35,203
So we developed
Corporate Campaign programs.

216
00:14:35,273 --> 00:14:38,071
And our campaign is one
of taking the offense,

217
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:40,077
showing that workers
can fight back.

218
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:43,581
That they don't have to keep
taking one loss after another.

219
00:14:45,283 --> 00:14:46,978
You know what we need to do.

220
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:51,079
JIM: Ray told me you're never
going to outspend a company,

221
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:53,215
public-relations-wise.

222
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:56,021
My name is Ray Rogers.
I'm with Corporate Campaign.

223
00:14:56,094 --> 00:14:57,789
JIM:
That what you needed to do

224
00:14:57,862 --> 00:14:59,693
was look at creating a situation

225
00:14:59,764 --> 00:15:02,358
that became
a newsworthy situation.

226
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:06,427
The company spent millions in
many years to build an image.

227
00:15:06,504 --> 00:15:07,937
That's being destroyed
overnight.

228
00:15:08,006 --> 00:15:11,134
JIM: The strategy was
to go after the money

229
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:12,471
behind the corporation.

230
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:15,206
There's a lot of labor money
in First Bank's system.

231
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,941
MAN: Ray Rogers
and his Corporate Campaign

232
00:15:17,015 --> 00:15:20,644
mailed this letter to over 5,000
union members in the Midwest

233
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:22,983
that says in part
the First Bank system

234
00:15:23,054 --> 00:15:25,750
is a principal stockholder
in the Hormel company

235
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,951
and thus can influence policy.

236
00:15:28,026 --> 00:15:30,654
This institution
is directly involved

237
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,856
in the policymaking process
of Hormel.

238
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:37,595
JIM: Ray knows how to put
labor's best foot forward

239
00:15:37,669 --> 00:15:41,196
so that John Q. Public would
sympathize with our cause.

240
00:15:41,272 --> 00:15:44,002
There's some guy I'd never seen.

241
00:15:44,075 --> 00:15:46,737
They started talking to me
about that Hormel situation.

242
00:15:46,811 --> 00:15:49,905
The guy says, "Are you the guy
that's been brought in?

243
00:15:49,981 --> 00:15:51,175
Man, I'm telling you,

244
00:15:51,249 --> 00:15:54,082
you can't imagine how many
of my friends are watching this.

245
00:15:54,152 --> 00:15:55,483
We're 100% behind you.

246
00:15:55,553 --> 00:15:57,282
You're teaching
this country something.

247
00:15:57,355 --> 00:15:58,982
And, by God, you gotta win."

248
00:15:59,057 --> 00:16:01,184
This is what I'm getting
everywhere.

249
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:04,126
You are a symbol of something
that goes beyond Austin.

250
00:16:04,195 --> 00:16:05,685
Don't you forget it.

251
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,031
Local P-9 engaged the services
of a labor consultant

252
00:16:13,104 --> 00:16:15,368
from New York City.

253
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,001
Mr. Ray Rogers
and Corporate Campaign.

254
00:16:19,077 --> 00:16:21,944
And Mr. Rogers has
a different philosophy

255
00:16:22,013 --> 00:16:24,413
about how to deal
with companies.

256
00:16:24,482 --> 00:16:25,972
Traditional
collective bargaining

257
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:30,044
is not the preferred method
that he would use.

258
00:16:30,121 --> 00:16:34,319
His traditional approaches
are harassment, intimidation,

259
00:16:34,392 --> 00:16:36,121
and threats.

260
00:16:36,194 --> 00:16:39,630
And his rationale for that mode
of approaching an employer

261
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,962
is that if you can
embarrass a company

262
00:16:42,033 --> 00:16:44,092
hard enough and long enough,

263
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,330
you'll bring that company
to its knees.

264
00:16:46,404 --> 00:16:49,237
And they will agree
to the terms and conditions

265
00:16:49,307 --> 00:16:52,435
of his client unions,
the ones that he represents.

266
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:55,343
So he came to us
with that approach.

267
00:16:57,015 --> 00:17:00,075
There's supposed to be
some other pigs here today.

268
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:04,112
CROWD: We don't need
First Bank's greed!

269
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,716
If anybody doesn't have a sign,
just grab a sign here.

270
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:11,091
CROWD: We don't need
First Bank's greed!

271
00:17:11,162 --> 00:17:13,756
From day to day, you get to be

272
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:16,130
on a high like today
with everybody here.

273
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,659
But when you go home
and nobody's around you,

274
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:20,898
you tend to get down.

275
00:17:20,972 --> 00:17:23,202
But then you get back up
when you go back

276
00:17:23,274 --> 00:17:25,333
to the union hall
and start helping.

277
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,934
Then you get up again.

278
00:17:27,011 --> 00:17:29,605
We're on
the right side of things.

279
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:32,673
People are realizing we're
willing to fight that fight.

280
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,981
People recognize
that the labor movement

281
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:36,850
being a key factor
if we're gonna have

282
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:41,290
any real meaningful social --
economic -- Cut.

283
00:17:50,935 --> 00:17:53,768
NARRATOR: Are you afraid
of Corporate Campaign?

284
00:17:53,838 --> 00:17:55,271
We're not.

285
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,672
What happens if they persist?

286
00:17:57,742 --> 00:18:00,176
Well, I don't know.

287
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,043
With our position,
I don't know what they can do.

288
00:18:03,114 --> 00:18:08,108
I realize that they can say
a lot of things,

289
00:18:08,186 --> 00:18:10,245
but they can't do
a lot of things.

290
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:14,018
And I think it's tragic, because
the only thing they end up doing

291
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:16,356
is destroying their jobs
and their company.

292
00:18:16,427 --> 00:18:18,952
MAN: Thank you all very much.
Appreciate it.

293
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,418
<i>NARRATOR: The United Food
and Commercial Workers</i>

294
00:18:44,489 --> 00:18:49,517
<i>is the parent union
of Austin's local union P-9.</i>

295
00:18:50,261 --> 00:18:53,924
The Local 9 will suffer
as a result of it.

296
00:18:53,998 --> 00:18:55,590
They can't negotiate
by themselves.

297
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:59,398
<i>Lewie Anderson is the director
of the meatpacking division.</i>

298
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:02,496
And they say, "This company
is a profitable company,

299
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:06,169
and nothing else
in the universe matters.

300
00:19:06,244 --> 00:19:07,939
We have a right to our $10.69.

301
00:19:08,012 --> 00:19:09,946
We have a right
to those benefits."

302
00:19:10,014 --> 00:19:11,413
That's their thinking.

303
00:19:11,482 --> 00:19:15,851
To go even beyond that there,
they are convinced by Ray Rogers

304
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,549
that the Corporate Campaign
will achieve that goal for them.

305
00:19:19,624 --> 00:19:22,593
He shot them
a line of shit, is all he did.

306
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,321
The plain fact of the matter is

307
00:19:24,395 --> 00:19:26,727
there is no doubt
in my mind whatsoever

308
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:31,292
they are not going to win
through a corporate campaign.

309
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:33,064
They are not gonna win.

310
00:19:33,137 --> 00:19:35,537
If they continue, they're
gonna become bigger losers

311
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:37,097
than what they are now.

312
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:39,473
It is gonna
cost them their jobs.

313
00:19:39,544 --> 00:19:43,207
Instead of making $8.25 an hour,
or $9.25 an hour...

314
00:19:43,281 --> 00:19:44,509
MAN ON RADIO:
Good one by Glen Campbell.

315
00:19:44,582 --> 00:19:46,140
It's time for the
song of inspiration

316
00:19:46,217 --> 00:19:47,912
brought to you by your friends

317
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:51,114
at Omaha Auto and Truck
Recyclers Association.

318
00:19:51,189 --> 00:19:53,157
It used to be
you always had problems.

319
00:19:53,224 --> 00:19:55,886
You always had
one or two local unions

320
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,088
that were going through
real serious problems,

321
00:19:59,163 --> 00:20:03,293
but you had some time to think
about it and to work with them

322
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,997
and stay with them and help them
work through those problems.

323
00:20:07,071 --> 00:20:09,232
But what you've had
in the last five years

324
00:20:09,307 --> 00:20:11,468
is everybody's had problems.

325
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:13,237
They've had them
all at the same time.

326
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:16,769
You're just running all over
the country in all directions,

327
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,076
trying to patch things up

328
00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:20,174
and get things going
in the right direction.

329
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:21,980
Then you don't get to stay.

330
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:25,318
You have to go deal
with another crisis.

331
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,858
The companies in this industry
are embarked on a program

332
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:31,089
to tear the wages up,
to tear the fringe benefits up,

333
00:20:31,162 --> 00:20:35,531
to return us to the days
of "The Jungle" 60 years ago.

334
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,591
Do the unions have any clout?

335
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:40,604
Does the public care
about the unions anymore?

336
00:20:43,207 --> 00:20:47,007
Can the unions
sell this message?

337
00:20:51,182 --> 00:20:52,149
CROWD:
Go!

338
00:20:52,216 --> 00:20:53,877
Go! Go!

339
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:56,477
Go! Go!

340
00:21:01,092 --> 00:21:03,026
<i>Local unions like P-9</i>

341
00:21:03,094 --> 00:21:06,621
<i>have complete autonomy
to carry on all union business</i>

342
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,359
<i>as long as they don't violate</i>

343
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,901
<i>their international
constitution.</i>

344
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:15,463
<i>The International Union
can only give strategic advice.</i>

345
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,100
MAN: What can you do
that we can't do?

346
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:20,303
- So far, I haven't seen much.
- Really?

347
00:21:20,378 --> 00:21:22,403
- [ Crowd groans ]
- There's your answer.

348
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,175
No, I want you to answer that.

349
00:21:24,248 --> 00:21:25,875
I want you to answer that.

350
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,248
You're reading too many things

351
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:30,810
about what Lewie Anderson
and other people are saying.

352
00:21:30,888 --> 00:21:34,380
- You're dodging the question.
- I'm not dodging the question.

353
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,017
That's a question
that was asked.

354
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:37,391
I'm not gonna answer it.

355
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,724
What you do not have,

356
00:21:38,796 --> 00:21:40,889
what the International
has not furnished,

357
00:21:40,965 --> 00:21:43,365
what you have not furnished
is the analysis

358
00:21:43,434 --> 00:21:47,302
upon which you build a program
of real, impenetrable economic

359
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:49,602
and political pressure,
harassing the company.

360
00:21:49,674 --> 00:21:52,871
We have developed some damn good
campaign literature.

361
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:55,105
I haven't seen anybody
from the International

362
00:21:55,179 --> 00:21:57,147
come and give you
that kind of direction

363
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:59,012
or campaign literature.

364
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:01,745
One thing I'll credit you.
You're a hell of a motivator.

365
00:22:01,819 --> 00:22:05,949
Millions of dollars worth
of free and positive publicity

366
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:08,720
for your campaign,
national press coverage.

367
00:22:08,793 --> 00:22:10,090
Yes, you have!

368
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:14,022
And that's your answer.

369
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:16,826
All right.

370
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:26,476
Hi.

371
00:22:26,544 --> 00:22:29,604
Hi.
Are you with P-9?

372
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,271
Mm-hmm.

373
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:32,077
Okay.

374
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,984
Is what Local 9
proposing up there

375
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:42,493
with the Corporate Campaign
the answer to the problems

376
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,824
we have seen in the meatpacking
industry in the past

377
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:49,060
and the challenges
that we're faced for the future?

378
00:22:49,133 --> 00:22:51,397
Sometimes you gotta do
what you gotta do, too.

379
00:22:51,469 --> 00:22:54,336
Are you saying that
regardless of what is decided

380
00:22:54,405 --> 00:22:58,341
by this organization,
you're going to go ahead

381
00:22:58,409 --> 00:23:00,843
with that campaign
as you've outlined it?

382
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:04,541
If the rank and file dictates
they're gonna resist pay cuts,

383
00:23:04,615 --> 00:23:07,743
we're gonna resist the pay cuts.

384
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:12,882
And I guess we would like to see
you on our side in this fight.

385
00:23:12,957 --> 00:23:14,720
The Austin program,
it occurs to us,

386
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:17,386
is symptomatic
of Reagan's philosophy.

387
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:21,125
"I'll get mine, and the hell
with everybody else."

388
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:23,690
RAY: Maybe we shouldn't expect
every meatpacker

389
00:23:23,768 --> 00:23:25,929
to receive the same wage.

390
00:23:26,003 --> 00:23:28,130
Maybe we need to look
at each company and say,

391
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:30,674
"What is the profitability
of the company?"

392
00:23:30,741 --> 00:23:34,142
Then base the wages that
we expect on its profitability.

393
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:37,739
God damn it, the guy working
at Armour, $6 bucks an hour,

394
00:23:37,815 --> 00:23:40,340
doing the same work
they're doing in Austin

395
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:41,885
deserves the $10.69, too,

396
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:44,114
as well as every other
packinghouse worker!

397
00:23:44,188 --> 00:23:46,918
That is what we stand for.
That is what we gotta do.

398
00:23:46,991 --> 00:23:50,188
We cannot have one group
hanging way up here

399
00:23:50,261 --> 00:23:52,456
and everybody else down below.

400
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,998
It's the wrong kind of unionism.

401
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:57,899
We're here saying, you know,
we've got a program.

402
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:01,564
We're representing a client
and a large group of people.

403
00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:03,436
We're gonna continue
to represent them

404
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:05,408
as long as they want us to.

405
00:24:05,476 --> 00:24:08,274
MAN: Why won't the International
support the Hormel workers?

406
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:11,179
Is $10.69 an hour too much?

407
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:14,013
Look, I worked
in those packinghouses.

408
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:17,248
I worked for a very antiunion
employer as a beef skinner,

409
00:24:17,321 --> 00:24:19,084
so I know what that work is.

410
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:22,320
And they deserve $10.69-plus,
believe me.

411
00:24:22,393 --> 00:24:24,657
One of the things
that Local 9 has said

412
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:26,196
to the Packing Committee

413
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:29,028
is, "Well, if we
can get $10.69 there,

414
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,864
that's the shining star,
and everybody will go to that."

415
00:24:31,936 --> 00:24:33,460
But I gotta tell you,

416
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,972
in some 10 or 15 years
of our experience,

417
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,132
that's not the case.

418
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:38,641
One of two things happens.

419
00:24:38,709 --> 00:24:42,145
Those operators on the low end
of the scale get bigger,

420
00:24:42,213 --> 00:24:45,410
or those on the high end
of that wage scale

421
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:48,179
say, "The hell with it,"
and they go out of business,

422
00:24:48,252 --> 00:24:50,686
or they close this plant
and go down the road

423
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:53,724
and open up a plant
at $5.00 or $6.00 an hour.

424
00:24:53,791 --> 00:24:55,315
That would be great
if we could do that.

425
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:57,725
I'd be the first to say,
"Let's do it."

426
00:24:57,795 --> 00:24:59,729
But it don't work that way.

427
00:25:00,898 --> 00:25:04,197
We came into this thing alone,
and we'll go out alone.

428
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,598
I want to tell you,
I am disgusted

429
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,699
to be even associated
with this organization.

430
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:12,743
You've got to.

431
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:15,278
John, take your pen
if you're disgusted.

432
00:25:15,346 --> 00:25:18,782
Yeah. You've got a lot
of gutless people here.

433
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,345
JIM: We pleaded
with the National Union

434
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:24,081
that if they couldn't support
us, get out of the way.

435
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:26,988
If you're gonna get in the way
and run interference for Hormel,

436
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:29,494
then we're gonna go right
through you if we have to.

437
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:43,534
So you've got the International
Union looking at it and saying,

438
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:45,508
"If these people are successful,

439
00:25:45,576 --> 00:25:47,874
they may find that
an International Union

440
00:25:47,945 --> 00:25:48,877
isn't necessary,

441
00:25:48,946 --> 00:25:52,677
and all they need is a labor
consultant from time to time.

442
00:26:00,057 --> 00:26:01,718
LEWIE:
Now we have a situation

443
00:26:01,792 --> 00:26:07,025
where some of the people
from Local 9 and Ray Rogers

444
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:10,363
have a caravan
roaming across the country,

445
00:26:10,434 --> 00:26:14,097
spieling out some of
the most antiunion venom.

446
00:26:14,171 --> 00:26:17,800
JIM: Our caravan was designed
to tell people what was going on

447
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:20,207
from workers
just like themselves.

448
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:21,711
We had the facts.

449
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:23,838
We had the information
to back it up.

450
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,543
We were gonna tell it
to them, give it to them,

451
00:26:26,617 --> 00:26:29,051
read it to them, sing it,
whatever it took.

452
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,213
RAY:
$100,000 expense account,

453
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:34,349
and Lewie Anderson was making
his $70,000-plus salary

454
00:26:34,425 --> 00:26:35,687
and his lavish expense account.

455
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,751
If you think
when the public sees that

456
00:26:37,828 --> 00:26:39,523
that they understand
the complexities

457
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:42,691
of what's going on
in Austin, Minnesota.

458
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,792
All they see
is 200 or 300 people

459
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:46,962
screaming how the union
is no good.

460
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:48,972
We're not like
some other locals.

461

at Hormel's history.

He talked to some people,

564
00:31:38,762 --> 00:31:41,754

once he put a public campaign

they were gonna crumble.

I should say,

567
00:31:47,938 --> 00:31:51,396
had about as much depth
as piss on a flat rock.

done before you figure out

00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:07,486

Being militant and standing up
if you're on the wrong strategy

"At least we're fighting."

583
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,732
Because when you fight and it's
over and you've lost everything,

584
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:31,679
that's a terrible price to pay
just to say that you were tough.

00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,482
like a fighter
going into a fight.

617
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:24,324
When you know you've trained
about as well as you can,

618
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:27,091
it's time to get the gloves on
or take them off

619
00:34:27,164 --> 00:34:28,791
and do what you got to do.

620
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:31,494
By over a 93% margin,

621
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:35,335
the contract proposal
termed by the company

622
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:39,502
to be their last and final offer
was rejected.

623
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:43,013
So the Executive Board has met,
and we intend

624
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,176
to give the company
a 48-hour-working-day notice

625
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,684
tonight before midnight.

626
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,948
[ Cheers and applause ]

627
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:54,282
<i>For the first time in 52 years,</i>

628
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:59,022
<i>Hormel's Austin plant was about
to be shut down by a strike.</i>

629
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:03,293
You're looking
pretty chipper today.

630
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,130
- Hi, Bill.
- Hiya, Jim.

631
00:35:05,202 --> 00:35:08,694
Too bad we can't meet
under better circumstances.

632
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,968
I need you to sign.

633
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:13,704
In fact, if you want to sign
a couple of them, you can.

634
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:20,984
We got new pencils for everyone,
just like the President.

635
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:22,610
No, we don't.

636
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:24,120
That's mine.

637
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:29,723
- Okay, there you go, Jim.
- Okay. Thanks.

638
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:34,998
What may result
from the Hormel workers' action

639
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:37,193
is a test
of just how much muscle

640
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:40,328
organized labor
can or cannot flex.

641
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:43,862
Kevin Berger, Channel 5
Eyewitness News, St. Paul.

642
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,548
NYBERG:
I think it is tragic.

643
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:58,486
We were hoping that some
resolve would be reached,

644
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:02,117
so that this community
and certainly our employees

645
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:04,787
wouldn't have to go through
what we're facing.

646
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:06,853
We've done everything
humanly possible

647
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:09,957
to resolve this thing
on reasonable terms.

648
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:12,434
But we aren't going to resolve
this dispute

649
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,470
on unreasonable terms.

650
00:36:13,537 --> 00:36:15,630
JIM: The company's strategy
is a clear one.

651
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:17,765
They want to freeze us out.

652
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,140
They want to starve us out.

653
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:25,979
And I think the motto that we at
Local 9 have is best exemplified

654
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:30,146
in one of Bruce Springsteen's
latest songs.

655
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:34,419
"We made a promise.
We swore we'd always remember.

656
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:37,120
No retreat and no surrender."

657
00:36:37,194 --> 00:36:40,823
And I think that the fact
that these people are here today

658
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:43,992
helping us so that the company
can't starve us out

659
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:47,401
is certainly a giant push
well on the way

660
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:50,998
to let this company know that
we are not about to surrender.

661
00:36:53,944 --> 00:36:55,639
- Hi.
- Hi.

662
00:36:56,213 --> 00:36:57,305
Hi.

663
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:06,816
What we started is something

664
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:12,193
that's gonna be
more than maybe what we thought.

665
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:16,165
I see people working together,
people willing to share,

666
00:37:16,233 --> 00:37:17,632
people borrowing clothes.

667
00:37:17,701 --> 00:37:20,761
I see people opening up.
I see people crying.

668
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:24,239
It's just a whole new part
of people,

669
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:25,969
and we're pulling together.

670
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:27,704
You know, we're a big family.

671
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:29,837
Just so it doesn't.

672
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:33,179
If it takes too long, people
are gonna get short on cash.

673
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,878
Then they're gonna feel
the squeeze really bad.

674
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:41,323
My kid five weeks ago got
his finger in the door at home.

675
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:43,121
Just one of those
freak accidents.

676
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:45,560
Went in and had three stitches.
120 bucks.

677
00:37:45,629 --> 00:37:48,189
There went half of my paycheck.

678
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:52,161
This money
is to be used for food

679
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:54,727
for the people of Local P-9.

680
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,673
I can't even add.

681
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:05,477
I can't even add.

682
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:08,882
One thousand...

683
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,352
One hundred...

684
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:18,286
Forty-nine dollars!

685
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,021
Almost $1,050.

686
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:22,622
And they're not done yet.

687
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:26,295
Take it in brotherhood.
Spirit.

688
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:30,830
JIM: This money will be very
much needed by our membership.

689
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:33,706
And I thank you
from the bottom of my heart.

690
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:44,816
Hey, Joe. They lost
their power over there.

691
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:47,858
JIM: Our union hall
became a fun place to be at.

692
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:50,553
There was a lot of things
going on.

693
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:54,496
It became a place
where families could come.

694
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:57,363
We had a lot of folks
who liked to work on cars.

695
00:38:57,434 --> 00:39:00,995
Instead of pulling picket duty,
they fixed our cars.

696
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:06,101
We had carpenters
who fixed people's homes.

697
00:39:06,176 --> 00:39:09,475
They did what they liked to do.
They did their hobbies.

698
00:39:19,823 --> 00:39:21,950
I asked Guyette,

699
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,426
"Tell me where
Corporate Campaign is today,

700
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:27,191
where it's going next week
and the following weeks

701
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:29,255
and relate that
to how we're getting back

702
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:30,300
into the packinghouse."

703
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:32,494
All they did
is the same old gibberish.

704
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,470
"We've got a group.
We're gaining support.

705
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:35,835
We got money coming in."

706
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:37,601
They start with this gibberish,
and you say,

707
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,074
"l didn't ask you that."

708
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:40,633
"Let him speak!"

709
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,544
Then Rogers
gets into his filibuster.

710
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:46,811
Then all of a sudden,
it's, "boom." "Next question."

711
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,374
"I was in Ottumwa,

712
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:50,920
and the guys there
were patting me on the back."

713
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:53,013
This guy gets it, and he talks
for 10 or 15 minutes.

714
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,320
LEWIE: When he gets up
to start his filibuster,

715
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:57,656
you got to have
7, 8, 9, 10 people say,

716
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,821
"Tell me how you're gonna get
the jobs back.

717
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,660
Tell me how you're gonna
get a contract."

718
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,597
You got to keep pounding
into him,

719
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:07,103
"Where are you as far
as settling this thing?"

720
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:08,832
You got some maniacs up there

721
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,739
in the leadership position
and a maniac in Rogers,

722
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:12,643
who has yet to do
one positive thing.

723
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:15,009
who has yet to do
one positive thing.

724
00:40:19,149 --> 00:40:22,050
We can't be jacking
around here forever.

725
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:26,355
This is a mess.
That's what I'm saying.

726
00:40:26,423 --> 00:40:32,157
Employees shall receive
as normal 40 hours' pay.

727
00:40:33,563 --> 00:40:35,030
Vacation pay shall consist

728
00:40:35,098 --> 00:40:39,034
of an employee's
normal 40-hour weekly check.

729
00:40:39,102 --> 00:40:41,502
- Yeah. That's good enough.
- Good.

730
00:40:43,173 --> 00:40:46,768
JIM: Normally, the National
Union managed negotiations.

731
00:40:46,843 --> 00:40:50,540
However, in this particular
situation, our national union

732
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,946
was spearheading
a concessionary drive,

733
00:40:53,016 --> 00:40:57,043
and we didn't want
a concessionary contract.

734
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:01,489
Therefore, our national union
was told, "Get out of the way.

735
00:41:01,558 --> 00:41:04,186
We'll deal
with our own negotiations."

736
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:06,092
It don't mean anything.

737
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:09,323
NYBERG:
When the union made a proposal

738
00:41:09,399 --> 00:41:11,526
that we thought was outrageous,

739
00:41:11,601 --> 00:41:15,128
what we had to do is come back
with a proposal of our own.

740
00:41:15,205 --> 00:41:18,003
Instead of just basing it
blindly on the old contract,

741
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:20,202
we looked at every provision
of that agreement and said,

742
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:21,710
"What would make sense here?"

743
00:41:21,778 --> 00:41:23,211
WOMAN:
Who's gonna pay for that?

744
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,838
MAN:
The company.

745
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:26,507
What is it?

746
00:41:26,583 --> 00:41:28,346
Joint Management Labor.

747
00:41:28,418 --> 00:41:30,818
LEWIE: Any seasoned,
experienced negotiator

748
00:41:30,887 --> 00:41:34,482
knows you don't rewrite
your whole contract.

749
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:39,285
You don't throw your
whole contract up for grabs.

750
00:41:39,362 --> 00:41:41,523
You don't give the company
the opportunity

751
00:41:41,598 --> 00:41:45,432
to dismantle your contract
because you rewrote it.

752
00:41:46,536 --> 00:41:48,868
But that's exactly what
the P-9 leadership did.

753
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:50,998
They rewrote a whole contract.

754
00:41:51,074 --> 00:41:53,872
Language it has taken
40 years to negotiate,

755
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:56,777
language that provides
the local union to have a say

756
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,714
in how the goddamn plant is run.

757
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:01,683
When management got done
with that contract,

758
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:03,310
those things didn't exist.

759
00:42:03,386 --> 00:42:07,686
And I'm speaking to 40 years
of bargaining gone as a result

760
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:10,318
of these assholes
rewriting that whole contract

761
00:42:10,393 --> 00:42:12,054
and submitting it
to the company.

762
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:48,925
Being a negotiator requires
a lot of different skills,

763
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:52,526
especially in an industry that's
in turmoil, like this one.

764
00:42:52,602 --> 00:42:55,537
Nobody likes to have their wages
and benefits rolled back.

765
00:42:55,605 --> 00:42:59,200
And it's unconscionable
to put out this proposal

766
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:02,006
after all the concessions
these workers made.

767
00:43:02,078 --> 00:43:03,477
What's your reaction?

768
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:06,277
- What's next?
- No further comments on that.

769
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:12,155
LEWIE: All I can do is take
a peek at their vaults

770
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:13,280
and see if there's any money.

771
00:43:13,356 --> 00:43:14,755
If there is,
we all run in there,

772
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:19,285
we grab as much of it as we can,
and we get the hell out.

773
00:43:19,362 --> 00:43:21,990
Negotiations have broke off.

774
00:43:22,065 --> 00:43:24,158
There are no further meetings
scheduled.

775
00:43:24,234 --> 00:43:26,225
LEWIE: That's pure,
unadulterated bullshit!

776
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:28,737
What's holding up
a contract settlement

777
00:43:28,805 --> 00:43:31,535
is that these bastards
won't give you a decent wage!

778
00:43:31,608 --> 00:43:33,508
That's what holding up
the settlement!

779
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:36,171
Send your bargaining committee
to Chicago

780
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:38,840
with a vote of confidence
that supports them

781
00:43:38,915 --> 00:43:40,883
and tells the company
to stick their proposal

782
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:43,852
where the sun don't shine
and give us a decent contract!

783
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,353
Thank you very much.

784
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:47,856
JIM: Sometimes you have to
fire the people up

785
00:43:47,924 --> 00:43:49,858
to send a clear message
to management

786
00:43:49,926 --> 00:43:53,020
that the workers
are really ticked off.

787
00:43:53,096 --> 00:43:55,530
That they not only want
what's right,

788
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,591
they want
more than what's right.

789
00:43:58,668 --> 00:44:02,126
You better be prepared to give
a lot back that was taken away!

790
00:44:02,205 --> 00:44:04,799
Or you four can start looking
for another job!

791
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:06,274
You want to come back
to these meetings?

792
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:09,471
I worked out in that plant,
and I busted my ass for you

793
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:11,480
for over 18 years on production.

794
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:13,641
All of a sudden,
you put the hammer down,

795
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:15,651
and we go from our $10.69

796
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:19,780
down to $6.50 to walk back
in that plant on a Monday.

797
00:44:19,856 --> 00:44:23,758
You want to come back?
You keep your mouth shut, okay?

798
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,920
You don't know
what you're talking about!

799
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,361
I won't take it anymore!

800
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:30,194
I won't have the courtesy
of letting you ask questions.

801
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:32,929
I'll walk out the next time
you open your mouth.

802
00:44:43,813 --> 00:44:48,375
LEWIE: The more that the
membership seems unreasonable,

803
00:44:48,451 --> 00:44:51,682
the more the bargaining
committee seems unreasonable,

804
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:53,279
the tougher they are...

805
00:44:54,624 --> 00:44:55,818
Hello.

806
00:44:55,892 --> 00:44:58,360
LEWIE: The more the employer
has to rely on you

807
00:44:58,428 --> 00:45:02,626
as the negotiator, because
you're the one, supposedly,

808
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:05,361
that has to make
common sense prevail.

809
00:45:05,435 --> 00:45:07,960
I'd like to carve out
numbers one and two

810
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,801
and continue to talk with you

811
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,170
to see if there's
something we can do,

812
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:12,640
but I haven't come up
with anything.

813
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:15,200
LEWIE: You only do that once you
have extracted the maximum

814
00:45:15,278 --> 00:45:17,041
from that employer.

815
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:22,511
And then you let
the membership decide.

816
00:45:22,585 --> 00:45:24,644
[ Crowd booing ]

817
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:34,022
They stole my check!

818
00:45:35,432 --> 00:45:38,162
LEWIE: That's a danger
when you fire the troops up,

819
00:45:38,234 --> 00:45:40,759
is that you get
their expectations so high

820
00:45:40,837 --> 00:45:43,533
and they believe those
expectations can be met.

821
00:45:43,606 --> 00:45:44,538
If you don't meet them,

822
00:45:44,607 --> 00:45:46,666
they believe
you haven't done your job

823
00:45:46,743 --> 00:45:48,734
and may believe
you sold them out.

824
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:51,178
We can't afford
to go backwards anymore.

825
00:45:51,247 --> 00:45:53,010
We've went back far enough.

826
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,017
We work too goddamn hard
down there

827
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:57,383
to have to go backwards anymore.

828
00:45:57,454 --> 00:45:58,512
I say, "Fuck them."

829
00:45:58,588 --> 00:46:01,352
If they want to close it down,
let them close it.

830
00:46:01,424 --> 00:46:03,255
We can all find something else.

831
00:46:03,326 --> 00:46:04,725
We're decent human beings,

832
00:46:04,794 --> 00:46:07,126
and we deserve
every damn thing we get.

833
00:46:07,197 --> 00:46:09,290
LEWIE:
If you take workers who feel

834
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:13,166
that they're
been mistreated or misused,

835
00:46:13,236 --> 00:46:15,136
they want to get
at the heart of the matter.

836
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:17,173
They want to get
to that employer.

837
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,969
It's their obligation
to give it to us.

838
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:22,671
If they don't want to,
then piss on them. Let them go.

839
00:46:28,885 --> 00:46:32,651
Look, between both of you,
you want a strike.

840
00:46:32,722 --> 00:46:34,986
You keep snapping
at everything for one.

841
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:37,993
- lf you want one.
- MAN: Some results, Lewie.

842
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:39,551
You think it's us?

843
00:46:39,629 --> 00:46:43,292
I can't deliver, and I don't
intend to carry this on.

844
00:46:43,366 --> 00:46:46,665
I can't deliver something
that's not there at this time.

845
00:46:46,736 --> 00:46:50,331
I've been banging around.

846
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:54,002
Quit looking for somebody to run
in with a fucking white horse!

847
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:57,638
You don't even know
what negotiations is all about,

848
00:46:57,714 --> 00:46:59,682
and you act like
you know everything!

849
00:46:59,749 --> 00:47:03,378
I did not come here and act
like I know everything, Lewie!

850
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:06,251
Our members are asking
for some answers, Lewie!

851
00:47:06,322 --> 00:47:08,085
Give your members some answers!

852
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:10,285
Don't lay the shit on me!

853
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:13,227
The easiest goddamn thing
to do is blame somebody

854
00:47:13,296 --> 00:47:15,764
for the problem you're in!

855
00:47:15,832 --> 00:47:18,960
We didn't blame you for
the problem we're in.

856
00:47:19,035 --> 00:47:22,163
LEWIE: The biggest and most
powerful threat that you have

857
00:47:22,238 --> 00:47:24,706
is the threat of a strike.

858
00:47:24,774 --> 00:47:28,301
When you actually
have to use the strike,

859
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:31,575
then you are going into
an all-out war.

860
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:33,980
And you have to pick
your fights.

861
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:37,281
If I get emotional.
I seem tired about this.

862
00:47:37,353 --> 00:47:41,483
This is not jerk-off time.
This is serious business.

863
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:44,550
You better be able
to inflict some economic damage

864
00:47:44,627 --> 00:47:45,594
on that employer.

865
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:48,096
If you cannot get
into his pockets

866
00:47:48,164 --> 00:47:52,362
and take a lot of money out
and make the employer understand

867
00:47:52,435 --> 00:47:55,734
that it's better to settle
than it is to fight,

868
00:47:55,805 --> 00:47:58,740
then the employer
will crush you.

869
00:48:18,028 --> 00:48:21,122
<i>Hormel's production
has not been stopped.</i>

870
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:26,969
<i>The company shifted production
to their other plants</i>

871
00:48:27,037 --> 00:48:29,267
<i>that are still in operation.</i>

872
00:48:39,717 --> 00:48:42,811
<i>In Austin, they are using
their own management personnel</i>

873
00:48:42,887 --> 00:48:46,584
<i>to turn out thousands
of cans of Spam a day.</i>

874
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:03,871
MAN: It's got to be
blatantly obvious to everyone

875
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:06,307
that this company
doesn't want a contract.

876
00:49:06,377 --> 00:49:08,174
MAN #2:
We're at the crossroads.

877
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:09,405
JIM:
I want to win.

878
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,210
MAN: I don't think there's a guy
who don't want to win.

879
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:16,185
That's no excuse for doing
something you shouldn't.

880
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:17,515
All I'm saying is,

881
00:49:17,588 --> 00:49:21,046
whatever it takes to win,
I want to do it.

882
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:25,254
LEWIE: That, potentially,
is a time bomb

883
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:27,854
that can blow up
in all of our faces.

884
00:49:27,932 --> 00:49:30,230
The company is gonna end up
forcing a settlement

885
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:31,791
on those people out there.

886
00:49:31,869 --> 00:49:34,497
That is gonna be way under
the Hormel chain settlement

887
00:49:34,572 --> 00:49:36,904
and under the Oscar Mayer
settlement.

888
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:40,341
Here you're gonna have this
big company, very profitable,

889
00:49:40,411 --> 00:49:42,402
that has got
a substandard agreement

890
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:46,176
that's gonna tear the shit out
of our rates in the industry.

891
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:47,842
We are gonna negotiate shit

892
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:50,853
if they get stuck
with a bad settlement up there.

893
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:55,818
MAN:
You people are believing

894
00:49:55,893 --> 00:49:58,987
that we've got the power
to get them to the table.

895
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:01,292
It is my assessment

896
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:04,357
that the reason
that we have been unsuccessful,

897
00:50:04,435 --> 00:50:07,996
the reason that our strategy
hasn't worked,

898
00:50:08,072 --> 00:50:11,473
the reason that we've gone
to a 4-1/2-month strike,

899
00:50:11,542 --> 00:50:13,669
is simply that very issue.

900
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:15,735
We don't have the strength
to get them there.

901
00:50:15,813 --> 00:50:19,305
The division that some
have tried to create here

902
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:21,146
has been to our downfall.

903
00:50:21,218 --> 00:50:24,312
And I just wish that we could
act concerted.

904
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:28,290
The fact is, I think
we all realize right now

905
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:32,420
the company is in a very solid
and very legal position

906
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:34,930
to start that packinghouse up
without us

907
00:50:34,999 --> 00:50:37,331
if we don't go back to work.

908
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:41,701
Now, I think that the rank
and file here has been misled

909
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:44,104
in understanding
this company's position.

910
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:49,476
The problem is, Jim, the company
isn't gonna talk to you, period.

911
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,514
They've got a grudge
against you.

912
00:50:51,582 --> 00:50:53,049
You probably
got a grudge against them.

913
00:50:53,117 --> 00:50:57,850
And I don't care if we offer
to go back for 5 bucks an hour.

914
00:50:57,921 --> 00:50:59,479
The company
ain't gonna talk to you.

915
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,683
Why don't you talk to them?

916
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:05,251
Because I'm not part of the
negotiating board. That's why.

917
00:51:05,329 --> 00:51:06,921
WOMAN:
You're out of order!

918
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:10,660
Hey, you can rule me
out of order all you want.

919
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,463
I'm gonna tell you one thing.

920
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:14,128
Rule me out of order
all you want.

921
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:16,001
JIM:
Security?

until we're blue in the face.

how we say it again.

as we're going to go.

to go into negotiations

936

to talk about it anymore?

940

- Nope.
- Other than asking questions.

941
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:11,561
Yep.

There's no bargaining
whatsoever?

943

You think you're winning.
I don't think you're winning.

944
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,995
The company, I don't think,
thinks you're winning.

945
00:52:22,072 --> 00:52:25,371
You're at war, they're at war,
and they're not giving in.

946
00:52:41,759 --> 00:52:46,594
The contract that you work under
is your decision alone.

947
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:50,099
The Executive Board
has recommended rejection.

948
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:55,671
I have a family like you have.

949
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:58,207
And I want to be able
to say to them,

950
00:52:58,275 --> 00:52:59,936
as Hubert Humphrey said,

951
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,604
"I'd rather live 50 years
like a tiger

952
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:05,580
than 100 years like a chicken. "

NYBERG: We've got a $100 million
plant that needs to be run.

954
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:38,473
We're taking applications
tomorrow

955
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:41,449
from people that want
to work in that plant.

956
00:53:41,517 --> 00:53:43,246
And if Local P-9 says,

957
00:53:43,319 --> 00:53:46,186
"We are going to continue
to withhold our labor,"

958
00:53:46,255 --> 00:53:48,348
now the process is underway.

959
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,988
The union will have rights
to their jobs

960
00:53:53,062 --> 00:53:55,622
until they've been
permanently replaced.

961
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:21,781
No bills today.

962
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:34,100
When you got a place like this,
we got 4-3/4 acres and house

963
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:35,797
and lived here seven years.

964
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:40,275
And payments are, you know, a
couple hundred dollars a month.

965
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:43,676
I got a wife and three kids,
and I love them.

966
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:46,742
They'll understand later.

967
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:50,343
If it comes down to losing
this place, we'll survive,

968
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,684
just like a lot of people.

969
00:54:53,389 --> 00:54:54,981
I got to give R.J. credit.

970
00:54:55,058 --> 00:54:58,516
At least he made a stand,
you know.

971
00:54:58,594 --> 00:55:02,257
He put himself
on one side or the other.

972
00:55:02,331 --> 00:55:05,698
I'm on the side that's commonly
referred to as the P-10ers.

973
00:55:05,768 --> 00:55:07,235
That was my choice.

974
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:12,468
R.J. decided he wanted to follow
Ray Rogers and Jim Guyette.

975
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:15,067
It's a hard decision
to make for some people,

976
00:55:15,144 --> 00:55:18,739
but it wasn't for me
when we took that strike vote.

977
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:21,613
Go out there
and be willing to give up things

978
00:55:21,684 --> 00:55:24,312
and make things better
for us workers

979
00:55:24,387 --> 00:55:27,322
and workers around the
United States, union people.

980
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:29,585
We're tired of going backwards.

981
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:33,691
But then you have to look
at the rest of the economy.

982
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:36,391
Throughout the nation,
that's what's happening.

983
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:39,230
And I guess
maybe you have to swallow hard,

984
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:41,896
but if you want a job...

985
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:48,642

I guess, a little bit.

There's nothing worse
than a scab,

so how can you have anything
to do with a scab?

You guys have been giving in

01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:58,678
Don't be mad at us.

1076
01:00:58,754 --> 01:01:01,587
Blame it on the people
causing the problem.

1077
01:01:01,657 --> 01:01:02,817
That's across the tracks.

1078
01:01:02,892 --> 01:01:04,826
It's them that put you
in this position,

1079
01:01:04,894 --> 01:01:07,226
because they put us
in this position.

1080
01:01:07,296 --> 01:01:10,163
We don't know who's going in
there to do what, so to stop it,

1081
01:01:10,232 --> 01:01:11,824
we had to stop everybody
that goes in that plant.

1082
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:13,630
We had to close it down.

1083
01:01:13,703 --> 01:01:16,365
I don't want to merit
right or wrong.

1084
01:01:16,439 --> 01:01:18,999
I'm not gonna pick sides.

1085
01:01:19,075 --> 01:01:20,235
But I got a question.

1086
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:22,004
Is what the company's doing...

1087
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:24,672
I don't want
to discuss moralities.

1088
01:01:24,747 --> 01:01:26,578
Is what the company doing legal?

1089
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:29,243
They're not out there because
they like to holler

1090
01:01:29,318 --> 01:01:31,616
and fight and
they want to kill somebody.

1091
01:01:31,687 --> 01:01:33,848
They're out
'cause they want a contract

1092
01:01:33,923 --> 01:01:35,515
where they can go to work.

1093
01:01:35,591 --> 01:01:37,183
We want to work.

1094
01:01:38,594 --> 01:01:40,687
This is a tragedy for all of us.

1095
01:01:40,763 --> 01:01:42,321
I was born and raised here.

1096
01:01:42,398 --> 01:01:45,856
Members of my family
that are buried here.

1097
01:01:45,935 --> 01:01:48,495
These people are my friends
on all sides of this issue.

1098
01:01:48,571 --> 01:01:50,368
I've graduated
from high school with them.

1099
01:01:50,439 --> 01:01:52,907
I went to college
with some of these people.

1100
01:01:52,975 --> 01:01:54,533
This isn't
some impersonal thing.

1101
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:57,511
We're personally involved
whether we want to be or not.

1102
01:01:57,580 --> 01:02:01,107
We would do anything in our
power to try to resolve this.

1103
01:02:01,183 --> 01:02:02,616
It's a difficult situation

1104
01:02:02,685 --> 01:02:05,153
for both Chief Hoffman and I
to deal with.

1105
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:08,213
I can't tell you what it's like.
It's tearing us up.

1106
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:47,862
MAN:
Left! Left!

1107
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,693
Left, right, left!

1108
01:02:49,765 --> 01:02:51,357
Left! Left!

1109
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,698
Left, right, left!

1110
01:03:03,379 --> 01:03:05,142
Minnesota governor
Rudy Perpich

1111
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:07,648
called the National Guard,
trying to help maintain order,

1112
01:03:07,717 --> 01:03:10,777
as striking union meatpackers
and their supporters

1113
01:03:10,853 --> 01:03:14,619
blockaded the Hormel plant
in Austin, Minnesota.

1114
01:03:15,191 --> 01:03:19,491
- Hey, your clubs are cracked!
- Holy shit! Look at them go!

1115
01:03:20,796 --> 01:03:22,093
Behind the barricades.

1116
01:03:22,164 --> 01:03:24,997
MAN: I don't know if you know,
but this is your community,

1117
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:27,501
not two or three of them
greedy executives!

1118
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:31,301
What the hell's the matter
with you? Shut it down!

1119
01:03:32,908 --> 01:03:34,341
Shut her down!

1120
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:36,674
I want, no matter what happens,

1121
01:03:36,746 --> 01:03:40,614
if anybody gets hit,
if anybody gets hit,

1122
01:03:40,683 --> 01:03:43,083
you simply try
to identify who it is,

1123
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:45,086
but get back to that hall!

1124
01:03:46,088 --> 01:03:48,522
Wait a minute.
You see what they got here?

1125
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:50,183
There ain't no way
you got a chance

1126
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:52,784
on dealing with those clubs!

1127
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:55,387
So you better think rationally!

1128
01:03:55,464 --> 01:03:59,264
I don't want to see you in
a fight with the National Guard!

1129
01:04:01,036 --> 01:04:03,300
Okay, remember,
if anybody moves on you,

1130
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:05,363
just go back to the office.

1131
01:04:16,152 --> 01:04:18,950
There's varying opinions
from everyone here

1132
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:22,149
as to how many people
are gonna cross the line.

1133
01:04:22,224 --> 01:04:27,025
But it sounds as though

1134
01:04:27,096 --> 01:04:30,293
you're gonna have
a stampede situation.

1135
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:33,335
If what everybody
is reflecting is accurate.

1136
01:04:33,402 --> 01:04:35,393
MAN:
Let's get our people

1137
01:04:35,471 --> 01:04:38,599
and tell 'em the straight shot,
like they deserve.

1138
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:41,973
We got lots of folks that
are gonna go in there tomorrow

1139
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:45,536
because the Guard's gonna
let everybody in.

1140
01:04:45,614 --> 01:04:47,980
So let's all
go back in tomorrow.

1141
01:04:48,584 --> 01:04:51,849
I don't think there's gonna be
that many going in tomorrow.

1142
01:04:51,921 --> 01:04:53,786
I don't think
we've shown our last shot.

1143
01:04:53,856 --> 01:04:55,255
I'm not ready to give up.

1144
01:04:55,324 --> 01:04:57,019
- No.
- Shit, not me.

1145
01:04:57,092 --> 01:04:58,525
I got some real problems

1146
01:04:58,594 --> 01:05:02,052
because I can see tomorrow
and you guys can't.

1147
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:05,498
But, boy,
that's what makes me sick.

1148
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:07,399
Go home and take
a couple aspirin.

1149
01:05:07,469 --> 01:05:09,061
You'll feel better
in the morning.

1150
01:05:09,138 --> 01:05:11,902
Jesus Christ,
I won't feel a bit better.

1151
01:05:14,343 --> 01:05:16,811
Left, left, right, left.

1152
01:05:16,879 --> 01:05:20,246
I've been out of work
for six years. I need a job.

1153
01:05:20,316 --> 01:05:21,977
NARRATOR:
How have you been getting by?

1154
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:23,609
Just doing odd jobs.

1155
01:05:23,686 --> 01:05:26,883
Must be hard. You ever worked
in a packinghouse?

1156
01:05:26,956 --> 01:05:28,423
No.

1157
01:05:28,490 --> 01:05:30,355
- Where are you from?
- McIntyre.

1158
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:33,259
- How'd you hear about it?
- Been on the news.

1159
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:35,524
I got neighbors that work here.

1160
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:38,226
Does it feel hard to go
across the picket line?

1161
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:39,699
No.

1162
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:42,737
- Scab!
- Hey, you lowlife!

1163
01:05:43,706 --> 01:05:46,197
When you go across that line,
that's your decision.

1164
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:49,142
You just don't let it
bother you.

1165
01:05:49,211 --> 01:05:50,610
You'd better be able
to stand it,

1166
01:05:50,679 --> 01:05:53,239
or you should have
never went across.

1167
01:05:55,184 --> 01:05:56,708
NARRATOR:
Why are you doing this?

1168
01:05:56,785 --> 01:05:58,047
Because I need a job.

1169
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,247
When was the last time
you worked?

1170
01:06:00,322 --> 01:06:03,189
Oh, last spring.

1171
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:04,954
- Where are you from?
- Austin.

1172
01:06:05,027 --> 01:06:06,221
Okay.

1173
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:12,623
You're crossing a picket line!

1174
01:06:12,701 --> 01:06:14,931
You're a scab!

1175
01:06:17,172 --> 01:06:19,402
Hey, scab, go home!

1176
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:21,033
Go home, scab!

1177
01:06:32,855 --> 01:06:36,882
JIM: Some people may be looking
for excuses to cross.

1178
01:06:36,959 --> 01:06:40,918
But remember that your
self-respect will be left behind

1179
01:06:40,996 --> 01:06:43,931
if anyone decides to cross
the picket line.

1180
01:06:43,999 --> 01:06:46,092
You know,
my family is starving.

1181
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:49,660
I'm not getting a thing from
anybody other than $40 a week,

1182
01:06:49,738 --> 01:06:52,002
just like everybody else
in here.

1183
01:06:52,074 --> 01:06:53,439
I want my job,

1184
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:57,001
just like everybody in here
wants their job.

1185
01:06:57,079 --> 01:06:59,673
I'm seriously considering
crossing.

1186
01:06:59,748 --> 01:07:01,272
I'd be a liar
if I said I wasn't.

1187
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:02,612
Don't do it!

1188
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:04,346
I didn't say I was.

1189
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:06,047
I said I was considering.

1190
01:07:06,121 --> 01:07:08,351
What I'm saying is,
a lot of you people,

1191
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:10,551
and you'd be liars
if you say you didn't,

1192
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:12,423
haven't considered crossing.

1193
01:07:12,494 --> 01:07:14,121
Because we all need jobs.

1194
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:17,461
What plan of action is
everybody here looking for?

1195
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:20,400
I think we're all looking
for some plan of action.

1196
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:22,869
Either we gotta
shut down every plant

1197
01:07:22,938 --> 01:07:24,769
that Hormel owns Monday morning.

1198
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:27,968
Or Tuesday or Wednesday
we might as well all go back

1199
01:07:28,043 --> 01:07:30,409
if we don't shut down
their goddamn plants

1200
01:07:30,479 --> 01:07:32,071
and shut 'em down fast.

1201
01:07:32,147 --> 01:07:36,413
I think that you guys can't keep
going and saying, "l agree."

1202
01:07:36,485 --> 01:07:39,716
The company says
they're not gonna meet.

1203
01:07:39,788 --> 01:07:41,551
The company says
they're not gonna give.

1204
01:07:41,624 --> 01:07:45,424
They're not gonna give Monday,
not Tuesday, not Wednesday.

1205
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:48,759
And all that time,
you got some more guys going in,

1206
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:51,493
and so what we're all saying is

1207
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:53,967
you gotta either shut down
the other plants

1208
01:07:54,036 --> 01:07:56,163
<i>or, like you said,
all go in en masse</i>

1209
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:57,967
and work without a contract.

1210
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:59,974
But it's gotta be
one or the other.

1211
01:08:00,042 --> 01:08:01,566
It can't be dragged out

1212
01:08:01,644 --> 01:08:05,045
and waiting for the company
to give you something.

1213
01:08:05,114 --> 01:08:07,844
They told you they ain't
gonna give you anything else.

1214
01:08:13,455 --> 01:08:17,186
Now we're looking at shutting
the other operations down.

1215
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:18,283
Don't you feel

1216
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:23,525
that that's a much more
pressurizing strategy

1217
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:25,863
on this company at this time?

1218
01:08:25,934 --> 01:08:29,426
Especially in light of the fact
that those people know

1219
01:08:29,505 --> 01:08:32,599
that whatever happens here
is gonna happen to them.

1220
01:08:32,675 --> 01:08:34,472
We need to communicate that.

1221
01:08:34,543 --> 01:08:35,703
Mm-hmm.

1222
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:39,179
Don't you think that that's
a better position to be into?

1223
01:08:39,248 --> 01:08:41,739
If you can't shut them down
completely,

1224
01:08:41,817 --> 01:08:42,943
you've accomplished nothing,

1225
01:08:43,018 --> 01:08:47,614
other than getting a whole lot
of people fired and out of work.

1226
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:52,855
What I'm saying to you is,
at what cost are you prepared

1227
01:08:52,928 --> 01:08:55,829
to take roving pickets
to that plant?

1228
01:08:55,898 --> 01:08:57,559
What are you gonna
do when they say,

1229
01:08:57,633 --> 01:09:01,592
"You screwed me out of a job.
Now what are you gonna do?"

1230
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:05,162
I'll say it. Hell, there's
nothing we can do for them.

1231
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:06,605
That's the risk we take.

1232
01:09:06,675 --> 01:09:08,040
Not we take.
They take.

1233
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:09,771
Okay.
It's the risk they take.

1234
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:11,779
We all take.

1235
01:09:11,847 --> 01:09:15,681
Yeah, we took it willingly,
and we took it to start with.

1236
01:09:15,751 --> 01:09:18,584
Now for our fight,
we're dragging them in.

1237
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:21,350
JIM: When does the realization
come to those folks

1238
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:24,187
that our fight
is indeed their fight?

1239
01:09:24,259 --> 01:09:27,660
When are we gonna do it
if we don't do it now?

1240
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:29,891
Mr. Nyberg, what will Hormel do

1241
01:09:29,965 --> 01:09:33,594
if P-9 sets up picket lines
at your other plants?

1242
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:36,229
Our employees know
that it is our position

1243
01:09:36,305 --> 01:09:39,274
that they'd be in violation
of the contracts

1244
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:41,775
if they voluntarily stay out

1245
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:43,709
and honor the picket line
of Local P-9

1246
01:09:43,779 --> 01:09:46,077
or however many pickets
there might be.

1247
01:09:46,148 --> 01:09:48,616
We know that if they do stay out

1248
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:51,710
that they will be subject
to replacement

1249
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:55,120
just as employees in Austin
are subject to replacement.

1250
01:09:57,659 --> 01:09:59,923
<i>The Executive Board
of Local P-9</i>

1251
01:09:59,995 --> 01:10:02,862
<i>decided to recommend that
the picket line be extended</i>

1252
01:10:02,931 --> 01:10:07,834
<i>to all other Hormel plants in
an attempt to shut them down.</i>

1253
01:10:07,903 --> 01:10:10,701
<i>With that came the promise that
if anyone at the other plants</i>

1254
01:10:10,773 --> 01:10:13,970
<i>got fired for honoring
P-9's picket line,</i>

1255
01:10:14,042 --> 01:10:16,408
<i>no P-9ers
would return to their jobs</i>

1256
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:20,175
<i>until the company agreed
to rehire everyone.</i>

1257
01:10:21,583 --> 01:10:25,679
You know, when you talk
about being illegal,

1258
01:10:25,754 --> 01:10:30,748
at one time, it was illegal
to go out on strike.

1259
01:10:30,826 --> 01:10:34,694
At one time, it was illegal
to join a union.

1260
01:10:34,763 --> 01:10:36,094
I guess at one time,

1261
01:10:36,165 --> 01:10:39,965
it was illegal
for America to even exist.

1262
01:10:40,936 --> 01:10:44,337
The Executive Board
has passed a motion.

1263
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:47,375
Roving pickets will be sent
to other plants.

1264
01:10:49,211 --> 01:10:54,080
If this is approved, it'll send
a message to the company,

1265
01:10:54,149 --> 01:10:56,709
to everyone else.

1266
01:10:56,785 --> 01:10:58,946
We made a promise.

1267
01:10:59,021 --> 01:11:04,857
We swore we'd always remember.
No retreat, no surrender.

1268
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:08,563
Speaking on the motion...

1269
01:11:10,165 --> 01:11:13,692
It's a unanimous
Executive Board recommendation.

1270
01:11:15,137 --> 01:11:18,106
All those in favor
signify by saying "aye."

1271
01:11:18,173 --> 01:11:20,573
CROWD:
Aye!

1272
01:11:20,642 --> 01:11:22,735
Those opposed.

1273
01:11:22,811 --> 01:11:24,278
Ayes have it.

1274
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:41,552
I repeat.
This is a union picket line.

1275
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:44,690
We ask that you do not cross it.

1276
01:11:44,766 --> 01:11:47,963
Take the day off.
One damn day is all we ask.

1277
01:11:48,036 --> 01:11:52,200
All Hormel plants will be shut
up tight as a drum by Friday.

1278
01:11:52,274 --> 01:11:54,902
There will be none running,
to our knowledge.

1279
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:56,638
We'd appreciate your support.

1280
01:11:56,712 --> 01:11:58,270
Go home and have
a cup of coffee.

1281
01:11:58,347 --> 01:12:01,976
Go talk to Ma and the kids
before they go to school.

1282
01:12:02,050 --> 01:12:04,280
MAN:
There's no way on God's creation

1283
01:12:04,353 --> 01:12:06,821
that I'm gonna cross
their picket line!

1284
01:12:10,025 --> 01:12:12,255
When I looked at a guy
I worked with for seven years.

1285
01:12:12,327 --> 01:12:15,819
I live in the same town he does,
22 miles up the road.

1286
01:12:15,898 --> 01:12:17,991
And I said to him,
"How do you feel?"

1287
01:12:18,066 --> 01:12:19,556
He said, "My heart's pumping."

1288
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:21,762
I looked at another guy
I worked with for seven years.

1289
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:25,170
I said, "How do you feel?"
He said, "My heart's pumping."

1290
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:27,708
I said, "Guess what?
You're union people."

1291
01:12:27,776 --> 01:12:30,506
We ain't crossing
no picket lines!

1292
01:12:30,579 --> 01:12:32,774
We ain't crossing them!

1293
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:50,195
What miracle do we expect to
happen in the next three days?

1294
01:12:50,265 --> 01:12:52,096
That's the question.

1295
01:12:52,901 --> 01:12:56,268
What miracle?
How or why?

1296
01:12:56,338 --> 01:12:59,603
We have tremendous spirit,
we've got a wonderful program.

1297
01:12:59,674 --> 01:13:03,542
And we seem to think that
if we just go one day at a time,

1298
01:13:03,612 --> 01:13:04,670
like an alcoholic.

1299
01:13:04,746 --> 01:13:07,408
Just keep the strike going
one more day,

1300
01:13:07,482 --> 01:13:12,044
and after today's over,
it'll keep going tomorrow.

1301
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:15,419
What do we expect
is gonna happen?

1302
01:13:15,490 --> 01:13:17,253
I'm mystified.

1303
01:13:25,267 --> 01:13:26,427
Scabs!

1304
01:13:26,501 --> 01:13:28,992
Go back to your own town, scabs!

1305
01:13:29,070 --> 01:13:32,938
Asshole! Go to hell!
I hope you rot in hell!

1306
01:13:36,811 --> 01:13:39,211
You're the one
that really hurts, Steve.

1307
01:13:39,281 --> 01:13:41,374
All these other guys are dicks.

1308
01:13:41,449 --> 01:13:44,782
When you went across there,
you really hurt.

1309
01:13:44,853 --> 01:13:46,514
What the hell's
the matter with you?

1310
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:48,488
How can you work
with those scabs?

1311
01:13:48,556 --> 01:13:52,083
Doesn't it bother you to go in
there with guys like that?

1312
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:53,525
Then you got no class.

1313
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:55,358
I don't know you.

1314
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:56,897
Who's your smiley partner?

1315
01:13:56,965 --> 01:13:59,866
I've known that guy
since we were in grade school.

1316
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:06,468
It's killing him inside.
He's told me that.

1317
01:14:06,541 --> 01:14:09,840
I tried to talk him out of it.

1318
01:14:09,911 --> 01:14:12,744
He said no.
It's what he had to do.

1319
01:14:14,115 --> 01:14:16,845
My wife and children
have been my backbone.

1320
01:14:16,918 --> 01:14:18,385
They've just.
"No way."

1321
01:14:18,453 --> 01:14:22,412
They knew in their minds
that if I did,

1322
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:24,720
I couldn't live with myself.

substantially

in two or three days,

1325
01:14:32,867 --> 01:14:36,735
I will base my decision
on the fact

1326
01:14:36,805 --> 01:14:39,865
that my family is number one
in my life, not my union.

NARRATOR: Are you gonna go
across the picket line?

1328
01:14:42,877 --> 01:14:44,811
So it appears it.

1329
01:14:44,879 --> 01:14:48,940
At this stage of the game,
well, it would be tough,

1330
01:14:49,017 --> 01:14:53,954
but I can't see any alternative.

1331
01:14:54,022 --> 01:14:57,185
Now that we've been working on
this for a year and a half

1332
01:14:57,258 --> 01:14:58,816
trying to figure out
the difference

1333
01:14:58,893 --> 01:15:00,360
between right and wrong,

1334
01:15:00,428 --> 01:15:03,556
I believe that I was a dupe,
I was lied to originally.

1335
01:15:03,631 --> 01:15:06,725
And now he's got control
of my whole life.

1336
01:15:06,801 --> 01:15:09,463
On the other hand,
it's a question of morality,

1337
01:15:09,537 --> 01:15:11,129
because I was brought up

1338
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:13,834
that you do not cross a
picket line, no matter what.

1339
01:15:13,908 --> 01:15:15,808
It's something
that you do not do.

1340
01:15:15,877 --> 01:15:18,641
Because you don't belong
to a union all these years

1341
01:15:18,713 --> 01:15:20,738
and develop
all these principles.

1342
01:15:20,815 --> 01:15:22,942
It isn't like a dollar bill.

1343
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:25,452
You can't throw it on the ground
and be rid of it.

1344
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:28,717
As much as I want my job back,

1345
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:32,590
I've still been a good
union member for many years.

1346
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:35,390
But I don't know.

1347
01:15:35,463 --> 01:15:36,862
My family comes first.

1348
01:15:36,931 --> 01:15:39,957
My daughter goes to work.
She's got a part-time job.

My boy, he works at McDonald's,

01:15:43,071 --> 01:15:45,733
My wife goes to work.
She's got a job.

1351
01:15:45,807 --> 01:15:49,106
And what do I do? I sit home,
and I play with the cat.

1352
01:15:49,177 --> 01:15:51,372
What kind of provider is that?

1353
01:15:51,446 --> 01:15:52,504
It may sound corny,

1354
01:15:52,580 --> 01:15:55,208
but a person takes pride
in being a breadwinner

1355
01:15:55,283 --> 01:15:58,047
and providing for your family.

1356
01:15:58,119 --> 01:15:59,416
When you can't do that,

1357
01:15:59,487 --> 01:16:02,251
when you say to them,
"All I want to do is work,"

1358
01:16:02,323 --> 01:16:04,518
and they...

It's tough.

01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:11,696
But I spent more
than we should have.

1361
01:16:11,766 --> 01:16:15,133
But I want to go back to work.

1362
01:16:15,203 --> 01:16:18,536
And the hell with P-9.

you feel like you're betraying.

1380
01:18:47,055 --> 01:18:48,647
- Where you guys going?
- To work.

1381
01:18:48,723 --> 01:18:51,590
- You got a pass for that?
- You want to see our cards?

1382
01:18:51,659 --> 01:18:54,059
Just Hormel cards?
You want to see them?

1383
01:18:54,128 --> 01:18:56,323
Yeah.
You new employees?

1384
01:18:56,397 --> 01:18:59,798
No, no. Not by any stretch
of the imagination.

1385
01:19:00,735 --> 01:19:04,364
WOMAN: To some, staying out
no longer makes sense.

1386
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:06,634
There is more here
than a town divided,

1387
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:09,176
as brother watches brother
cross the line

1388
01:19:09,244 --> 01:19:14,944
in a place not big enough for
anyone to hide for very long.

1389
01:19:15,016 --> 01:19:18,144
He won't be my brother
if he crosses the line.

1390
01:19:24,425 --> 01:19:29,624
For me, it wasn't tough
to get to the point of the gate.

1391
01:19:29,697 --> 01:19:30,527
I was ready.

1392
01:19:30,598 --> 01:19:34,056
But the minute
we crossed that line,

1393
01:19:34,135 --> 01:19:36,467
part of me
just stayed back there.

1394
01:19:36,537 --> 01:19:39,870
Well, unionism, to me,
is watching out

1395
01:19:39,941 --> 01:19:43,104
not only for your own job,
but you're an organization

1396
01:19:43,177 --> 01:19:45,805
for the welfare and benefit
of all the workers.

1397
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:51,147
And now, you know,
for this moment, we aren't.

1398
01:19:51,219 --> 01:19:52,846
Because we left them.

1399
01:19:56,024 --> 01:19:59,152
You know, I wasn't always
International president.

1400
01:19:59,227 --> 01:20:02,060
I used to work
in the grocery stores, you know.

1401
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:04,621
And I know what it is
to work for peanuts.

1402
01:20:04,699 --> 01:20:06,599
And you think I like the fact

1403
01:20:06,668 --> 01:20:09,728
that our people got to roll
their wages back a bit?

1404
01:20:09,804 --> 01:20:10,600
I don't.

1405
01:20:10,672 --> 01:20:12,367
But I tell you what.

1406
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,408
I don't take people
over a cliff.

1407
01:20:14,475 --> 01:20:17,000
There's an old rule
in the labor movement.

1408
01:20:17,078 --> 01:20:19,706
Anybody can put people
on the street.

1409
01:20:19,781 --> 01:20:22,341
It takes a man to put them
back to work. I'm sorry.

1410
01:20:22,417 --> 01:20:25,147
It takes a man or a woman
to put them back to work.

1411
01:20:25,219 --> 01:20:27,687
Now is the time to settle it.

1412
01:20:27,755 --> 01:20:29,222
Hopefully, we can work it out

1413
01:20:29,290 --> 01:20:32,020
through the course
of our local union.

1414
01:20:32,093 --> 01:20:36,086
If we don't, then in a short
period of time, I'll settle it.

1415
01:20:36,164 --> 01:20:37,893
- Question.
- I'll settle it.

1416
01:20:37,965 --> 01:20:41,731
- How will you settle it?
- I told you I'll settle it.

1417
01:20:41,803 --> 01:20:43,668
I have a meeting.
Thank you.

1418
01:20:45,506 --> 01:20:47,997
The United Food and Commercial
Workers Union

1419
01:20:48,076 --> 01:20:50,772
ordered 1,000 members
of its meatpackers local

1420
01:20:50,845 --> 01:20:52,972
to end their bitter
seven-month strike

1421
01:20:53,047 --> 01:20:55,277
against Hormel
in Austin, Minnesota.

1422
01:20:55,349 --> 01:20:57,544
The International Union said
it had lifted its sanction

1423
01:20:57,618 --> 01:20:58,312
of the walkout

1424
01:20:58,386 --> 01:21:01,253
and cut off $40-a-week benefits
to strikers.

1425
01:21:01,322 --> 01:21:03,654
But pickets remained in place
through the day.

1426
01:21:03,725 --> 01:21:05,693
WOMAN: It is a strike,
those on the line say,

1427
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,819
is becoming symbolic
of the struggle

1428
01:21:07,895 --> 01:21:10,056
to keep trade unions alive.

1429
01:21:14,902 --> 01:21:19,032
If they end up operating
that plant nonunion

1430
01:21:19,107 --> 01:21:22,736
and your guys
never get back in there,

1431
01:21:22,810 --> 01:21:25,779
will you consider that
a big defeat for you?

1432
01:21:25,847 --> 01:21:27,371
Or not?

1433
01:21:27,448 --> 01:21:29,507
Number one,

1434
01:21:29,584 --> 01:21:32,815
if I say there's no way I could
look at this as a defeat,

1435
01:21:32,887 --> 01:21:35,720
then you're gonna say,
"How can you say that?

1436
01:21:35,790 --> 01:21:38,691
Now, you either win
or you're gonna lose."

1437
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:42,628
And let's talk about
what has happened here

1438
01:21:42,697 --> 01:21:46,360
and about the types of
victory and defeat you can have.

1439
01:21:46,434 --> 01:21:49,198
If all the workers
lose their job here,

1440
01:21:49,270 --> 01:21:52,137
okay, if that's a scenario
that you're playing,

1441
01:21:52,206 --> 01:21:55,733
yeah, that is certainly
a defeat that way.

1442
01:21:55,810 --> 01:21:59,337
But when you consider the fight
these people have fought.

1443
01:21:59,413 --> 01:22:02,075
Are you saying that 1,000 guys
lose their jobs,

1444
01:22:02,150 --> 01:22:04,846
and because they've got
intense national attention

1445
01:22:04,919 --> 01:22:07,615
on these important problems
that confront labor,

1446
01:22:07,688 --> 01:22:09,053
that could still be a victory?

1447
01:22:09,123 --> 01:22:10,556
No, what I am saying,

1448
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:13,321
there's been a set of dynamics
that has occurred

1449
01:22:13,394 --> 01:22:16,886
both with all the people in this
area, within this community,

1450
01:22:16,964 --> 01:22:19,432
and within the labor movement.

1451
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:23,334
That cannot be considered
anything but positive.

1452
01:22:41,189 --> 01:22:44,784
JIM:
I think that we at P-9

1453
01:22:44,859 --> 01:22:48,192
started
this small labor dispute.

1454
01:22:48,262 --> 01:22:51,459
It quickly escalated
into a labor dispute

1455
01:22:51,532 --> 01:22:54,126
that represented
a lot of things.

1456
01:22:55,603 --> 01:23:00,040
Taking on one of the corporate
giants in an industry.

1457
01:23:00,107 --> 01:23:02,871
Taking on one of the largest
international unions

1458
01:23:02,944 --> 01:23:05,606
in the country.

1459
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:08,547
And really recognizing
the forces

1460
01:23:08,616 --> 01:23:11,449
that working people
have to deal with.

1461
01:23:17,124 --> 01:23:22,892
If a small union in the middle
of a cornfield in Minnesota

1462
01:23:22,964 --> 01:23:27,424
can do the kinds of things
we do...

1463
01:23:28,236 --> 01:23:31,171
We just need to get about
the business of doing it.

1464
01:23:56,530 --> 01:23:59,465
LEWIE: I don't believe
the membership elects leaders

1465
01:23:59,533 --> 01:24:02,024
to be heroes at their expense.

1466
01:24:02,870 --> 01:24:05,498
Talks about dignity and
everybody going back together.

1467
01:24:05,573 --> 01:24:08,303
What dignity is there
when you don't have a job?

1468
01:24:08,376 --> 01:24:10,367
There's no dignity at all.

1469
01:24:16,851 --> 01:24:18,682
<i>In June of 1986,</i>

1470
01:24:18,753 --> 01:24:22,280
<i>the International took over
the local union</i>

1471
01:24:22,356 --> 01:24:26,486
<i>and threw out the elected
leadership of Local P-9.</i>

1472
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:29,393
The main things
that the order covers is

1473
01:24:29,463 --> 01:24:36,335
if anybody physically confronts
the UFCW, if they remove assets,

1474
01:24:36,404 --> 01:24:41,000
or if they hold themselves out
to be representing Local P-9

1475
01:24:41,075 --> 01:24:43,066
rather than just saying
they're a member of P-9.

1476
01:24:43,144 --> 01:24:45,669
Do I have to say I'm suspended?

1477
01:24:45,746 --> 01:24:47,577
The order's
pretty clear on that.

1478
01:24:47,648 --> 01:24:49,707
I got to say I'm suspended?

1479
01:24:58,559 --> 01:24:59,924
<i>The International Union</i>

1480
01:24:59,994 --> 01:25:02,155
<i>negotiated a settlement
with Hormel,</i>

1481
01:25:02,229 --> 01:25:05,255
<i>whereby the people
who crossed the picket line</i>

1482
01:25:05,333 --> 01:25:08,268
<i>would receive the same wages
and benefits as workers</i>

1483
01:25:08,336 --> 01:25:10,964
<i>at the other Hormel plants.</i>

1484
01:25:11,038 --> 01:25:14,599
<i>$10.25 per hour.</i>

1485
01:25:19,013 --> 01:25:20,776
We didn't stand by the company.

1486
01:25:20,848 --> 01:25:23,681
We stood by
the International Union.

1487
01:25:23,751 --> 01:25:25,616
Kiss my ass!
Kiss my ass!

1488
01:25:25,686 --> 01:25:27,313
You're full of shit.

1489
01:25:27,388 --> 01:25:30,380
You went back to save
your ass and save your job.

1490
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:32,016
By God, we needed our jobs.

1491
01:25:32,093 --> 01:25:34,891
We took our chances
with Hormel with the hope

1492
01:25:34,962 --> 01:25:37,988
that unionism
would somehow survive.

1493
01:25:38,065 --> 01:25:42,365
We left the union
and we went back to our jobs.

1494
01:25:42,937 --> 01:25:44,768
That's where it was.

1495
01:25:44,839 --> 01:25:46,500
[ Booing and jeering ]

1496
01:25:48,542 --> 01:25:50,567
Go ahead.
You can scream and holler.

1497
01:25:50,644 --> 01:25:53,078
Get that out of your system.
Then we can proceed.

1498
01:25:54,682 --> 01:25:58,345
There's one part in the contract
that I must have missed.

1499
01:25:58,419 --> 01:26:03,516
It's the part that says
they have to take me

1500
01:26:03,591 --> 01:26:06,287
and the rest
of all these guys back.

1501
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:08,123
This is the way I feel.

1502
01:26:08,195 --> 01:26:12,063
Hormel's will never take me back
unless I put it in the contract

1503
01:26:12,133 --> 01:26:13,862
or you put it in the contract.

1504
01:26:13,934 --> 01:26:15,902
And if that's not
in the contract,

1505
01:26:15,970 --> 01:26:19,235
all this bullshit of a contract
don't mean nothing to me.

1506
01:26:19,306 --> 01:26:23,140
Because how many days' vacation
or how much of this they get.

1507
01:26:23,210 --> 01:26:27,544
I don't get none of it, because
I didn't get back in the plant.

1508
01:26:27,615 --> 01:26:30,584
<i>The contract did not contain
any provisions</i>

1509
01:26:30,651 --> 01:26:34,815
<i>for the people
who honored the picket line.</i>

1510
01:26:36,390 --> 01:26:40,292
<i>These people were placed
on a waiting list.</i>

1511
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:43,762
It's time, and I think you
people have realized, too.

1512
01:26:43,831 --> 01:26:46,061
Had we pulled together
two years ago,

1513
01:26:46,133 --> 01:26:48,761
I don't think you or us
would be faced with this.

1514
01:26:48,836 --> 01:26:51,930
But I think it's the thing
that's going on in America,

1515
01:26:52,006 --> 01:26:54,873
and I think we as men and women
have to realize

1516
01:26:54,942 --> 01:26:56,239
we better start pulling
together,

1517
01:26:56,310 --> 01:26:59,006
or, by God,
they're gonna bury us.

1518
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:36,846
Part of why
it's gonna be so hard to leave

1519
01:27:36,918 --> 01:27:39,546
is because I'm gonna have to
leave my mom and dad.

1520
01:27:39,621 --> 01:27:41,088
My dad's still out on strike,

1521
01:27:41,156 --> 01:27:44,751
and I feel like
I'm abandoning him, almost.

1522
01:27:44,826 --> 01:27:50,492
But we feel like we have to get
on with our lives for the kids.

1523
01:27:50,565 --> 01:27:52,897
They need a normal atmosphere
they can grow up in.

1524
01:27:52,967 --> 01:27:55,868
I know my dad will be okay,
'cause he's a survivor.

1525
01:27:55,937 --> 01:27:58,531
And he knows that
we're still behind him 100%.

1526
01:27:58,606 --> 01:27:59,903
We're not abandoning him.

1527
01:27:59,974 --> 01:28:03,432
We're just taking our fight
somewhere else.

1528
01:28:06,481 --> 01:28:09,814
As far as the strike goes,
it was time.

1529
01:28:09,884 --> 01:28:11,078
It was past time.

1530
01:28:11,152 --> 01:28:14,781
Mike took a stand and refused
to go across the picket line.

1531
01:28:14,856 --> 01:28:17,916
I'm glad he wouldn't, because
I wouldn't have wanted him to.

1532
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:41,505
LEWIE: You hear this business
of "Old Jay Hormel,

1533
01:28:41,583 --> 01:28:43,949
if he was around,
things wouldn't run this way,"

1534
01:28:44,018 --> 01:28:46,282
or "We got this new crop
of executives,

1535
01:28:46,354 --> 01:28:47,719
and they've changed
the direction."

1536
01:28:47,789 --> 01:28:49,586
They didn't change nothing.

1537
01:28:49,657 --> 01:28:53,821
Hormel changed because it was
to their advantage to change.

1538
01:28:53,895 --> 01:28:56,090
They realized
there was profits and growth

1539
01:28:56,164 --> 01:28:57,893
by pursuing this strategy.

1540
01:28:57,966 --> 01:28:59,058
And they did it.

1541
01:28:59,133 --> 01:29:00,828
All of a sudden,
they're not benevolent anymore

1542
01:29:00,902 --> 01:29:02,927
and they're not
so paternalistic.

1543
01:29:03,004 --> 01:29:06,633
They become barracudas,
just like everybody else.

1544
01:29:09,644 --> 01:29:12,807
We can't look to unions and say,
"You gotta stop this."

1545
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:16,338
It's gonna take a combination
of outrage from people.

1546
01:29:16,417 --> 01:29:18,715
Whether you support a union
or you don't,

1547
01:29:18,786 --> 01:29:21,846
is it right for
these companies to do this?

1548
01:29:22,991 --> 01:29:25,459
It can't be dealt with
just on the picket line

1549
01:29:25,526 --> 01:29:27,653
and just
at the bargaining table.

1550
01:29:32,267 --> 01:29:35,327
You're not looking
at short-term fixes here.

1551
01:29:51,653 --> 01:29:54,281
<i>When the union's
inspiration</i>

1552
01:29:54,355 --> 01:29:56,983
<i>Through the workers' blood
shall run</i>

1553
01:29:57,058 --> 01:29:59,959
<i>There will be
no power greater</i>

1554
01:30:00,028 --> 01:30:03,020
<i>Anywhere beneath the sun</i>

1555
01:30:03,097 --> 01:30:05,725
<i>Yet, what force on Earth
is weaker</i>

1556
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:08,769
<i>Than the feeble strength
of one</i>

1557
01:30:08,836 --> 01:30:14,604
<i>And the union
makes us strong</i>

1558
01:30:14,676 --> 01:30:19,409
<i>Solidarity forever</i>

1559
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:23,883
<i>Solidarity forever</i>

1560
01:30:23,951 --> 01:30:27,751
<i>Solidarity forever</i>

1561
01:30:27,822 --> 01:30:32,521
<i>And the union
makes us strong</i>

1562
01:30:32,593 --> 01:30:34,424
<i>In our arms
is placed a power</i>

1563
01:30:34,495 --> 01:30:36,827
<i>Greater
than their hoarded gold</i>

1564
01:30:36,898 --> 01:30:39,059
<i>Greater
than the might of armies</i>

1565
01:30:39,133 --> 01:30:41,158
<i>Magnified a thousand fold</i>

1566
01:30:41,235 --> 01:30:43,635
<i>We can bring together
the new world</i>

1567
01:30:43,705 --> 01:30:45,696
<i>From the ashes of the old</i>

1568
01:30:45,773 --> 01:30:50,506
<i>And the union
makes us strong</i>

1569
01:30:50,578 --> 01:30:55,015
<i>Solidarity forever</i>

1570
01:30:55,083 --> 01:30:59,281
<i>Solidarity forever</i>

1571
01:30:59,354 --> 01:31:03,120
<i>Solidarity forever</i>

1572
01:31:03,191 --> 01:31:07,787
<i>And the union
makes us strong</i>

1573
01:31:07,862 --> 01:31:12,231
<i>Solidarity forever</i>

1574
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:16,600
<i>Solidarity forever</i>

1575
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:23,839
