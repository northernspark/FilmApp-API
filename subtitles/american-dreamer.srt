2
00:02:15,607 --> 00:02:19,361
Dimitri, I think you owe
the rather large man...

3
00:02:19,447 --> 00:02:21,517
sitting on top of you an apology.

4
00:02:21,687 --> 00:02:24,804
- I'm sorry.
- I'd like you all to meet the killer.

5
00:02:26,607 --> 00:02:30,156
- Count Reneleau.
- Damn you, Rebecca Ryan.

6
00:02:30,927 --> 00:02:33,805
Rebecca, you are incredible.

7
00:02:36,207 --> 00:02:40,120
Dimitri, you know I always get my man.

8
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:41,916
No.

9
00:02:45,047 --> 00:02:49,325
Dimitri, you know
I always get my woman.

10
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:51,962
That won't work.

11
00:02:57,087 --> 00:03:00,477
You know I always get my person.

12
00:03:01,367 --> 00:03:03,005
That stinks.

13
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:09,720
Come on, Rebecca, be brilliant.
I want to go to Paris.

14
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,395
"'Dimitri,' said Rebecca...

15
00:03:23,207 --> 00:03:26,995
"'you know I always get my man.
Even when he's a woman."'

16
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:32,722
I like it.

17
00:03:38,687 --> 00:03:40,917
- I finished the contest.
- Contest?

18
00:03:41,127 --> 00:03:43,163
The Rebecca Ryan contest.
You want to read it?

19
00:03:43,247 --> 00:03:46,683
I'd love to, but I haven't
got time right now. I'll read it later.

20
00:03:47,887 --> 00:03:49,366
It's got a surprise ending.

21
00:03:54,847 --> 00:03:59,045
The important thing, kid, is that
you're doing something you like to do.

22
00:04:01,927 --> 00:04:03,519
I'll be home late.

23
00:04:04,807 --> 00:04:06,001
Have a nice...

24
00:04:08,327 --> 00:04:09,316
day.

25
00:04:09,567 --> 00:04:11,080
Why do you want to go to Paris, Mum?

26
00:04:12,207 --> 00:04:14,801
I've dreamed about going
ever since I was a little girl.

27
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,720
It's the most beautiful,
romantic city in the world.

28
00:04:17,807 --> 00:04:21,197
Boring. Did you really write
a whole book in here?

29
00:04:21,967 --> 00:04:24,322
Cut it out, guys. Careful.

30
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:27,480
No, it's not a whole book.
See, it's just a few pages.

31
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:31,082
It's a contest and you have to write
in the style of the Rebecca Ryan novels.

32
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:34,603
And then, if you write the best,
you win a free trip for two to Paris.

33
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,996
- I'd rather go to Africa.
- Why Africa?

34
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,886
Because he's seen the naked women
in National Geographic.

35
00:04:40,127 --> 00:04:43,164
He loves boobs, Mum.
You've raised a pervert.

36
00:04:43,247 --> 00:04:45,636
I've seen you
looking at the boobs, too, Kevin.

37
00:04:46,047 --> 00:04:48,436
I know, Mum. I'm a pervert, too.

38
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:20,556
- Let's take a trip to France.
- Let's.

39
00:05:21,887 --> 00:05:25,197
Listen to this recording
and repeat what you hear.

40
00:05:25,647 --> 00:05:28,923
- Ready to travel with us to Paris?
- Yes.

41
00:05:29,647 --> 00:05:30,841
- Oui.
- Oui.

42
00:05:31,367 --> 00:05:33,119
- No. Non.
- Non.

43
00:05:33,527 --> 00:05:36,599
- Please. S'il vous plaît.
- S'il vous plaît.

44
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,647
- Thank you. Merci.
- Merci.

45
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:44,119
Eins, zwei, drei, vier, fünf.

46
00:05:44,847 --> 00:05:48,237
Eins, zwei, drei, vier, fünf.

47
00:05:48,767 --> 00:05:52,077
- Very good. Sehr gut.
- Danke schön.

48
00:05:52,527 --> 00:05:57,078
Nietzsche says, "What doesn't
destroy me, makes me stronger."

49
00:05:58,607 --> 00:06:02,566
Nietzsche sagt, "Was nicht umbringt,
macht mich stärker."

50
00:06:02,847 --> 00:06:04,166
You've got to be kidding.

51
00:06:04,927 --> 00:06:07,361
"'Dimitri,' said Rebecca,
'you know I always get my man.

52
00:06:07,447 --> 00:06:08,766
"'Even when he's a woman."'

53
00:06:11,647 --> 00:06:12,921
What do you think?

54
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:14,884
"The important thing, kid, is...

55
00:06:15,407 --> 00:06:17,398
"you're doing something you like to do."

56
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:20,237
I was kidding. It was really good, Mum.

57
00:06:20,327 --> 00:06:21,726
- Do you really think so?
- Yeah.

58
00:06:21,847 --> 00:06:24,407
- Do you think it might win?
- Sure. Maybe.

59
00:06:25,447 --> 00:06:28,962
- Who's Dimitri?
- Dimitri is Rebecca's best friend.

60
00:06:29,087 --> 00:06:30,884
- Are they married?
- No.

61
00:06:31,407 --> 00:06:34,080
- Why not?
- Rebecca is very busy.

62
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:36,761
She's beautiful, she's talented.
She speaks five languages.

63
00:06:36,847 --> 00:06:37,882
Can she do kung fu?

64
00:06:37,967 --> 00:06:40,322
She is an aikido master.
She can do all that stuff.

65
00:06:40,447 --> 00:06:43,166
If she's all that great,
how come Dimitri didn't marry her?

66
00:06:44,047 --> 00:06:47,881
For one thing, every man she meets
falls immediately in love with her...

67
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:53,603
and Dimitri has other interests.

68
00:06:53,727 --> 00:06:57,481
- You mean he's a homo?
- Karl, I think it's time for bed.

69
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,920
Don't leave me in the dark with Kevin.
He's a homo, too.

70
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:03,282
Karl, who taught you to talk that way?

71
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:05,562
Ignore him, Mum.
He just wants attention.

72
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,997
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Mum.

73
00:07:10,207 --> 00:07:11,276
Night, Mum.

74
00:07:18,007 --> 00:07:18,996
Sleep tight.

75
00:07:20,887 --> 00:07:21,876
Homo?

76
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:30,275
"Prince Rupert slowly unbuttoned...

77
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,835
"Rebecca's silk blouse..."

78
00:07:34,207 --> 00:07:35,162
Hi, honey.

79
00:07:35,287 --> 00:07:38,404
Hello, sweetheart.
How was your day? Anything exciting?

80
00:07:40,767 --> 00:07:42,200
As a matter of fact...

81
00:07:45,087 --> 00:07:47,476
we've just about closed the Simon fund.

82
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,000
Honey, that's wonderful.

83
00:07:54,047 --> 00:07:58,518
"...his strong hands demanding
what she knew she..."

84
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:09,925
"'I want you, Rebecca... '"

85
00:08:11,247 --> 00:08:13,442
"'more than I've ever wanted... '"

86
00:08:58,207 --> 00:09:01,722
- You don't want to?
- Lf you want to.

87
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:04,640
- Only if you do.
- Sure, I want to.

88
00:09:04,727 --> 00:09:06,638
- You don't sound very sure.
- Sure I'm sure.

89
00:09:06,727 --> 00:09:09,525
It's just that these accounts
have to be logged...

90
00:09:09,607 --> 00:09:11,040
sometime before tomorrow morning.

91
00:09:13,327 --> 00:09:14,282
Okay.

92
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:24,956
I guess I could get up early
and do them in the morning.

93
00:09:25,047 --> 00:09:26,685
No, it's okay.

94
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,756
- You sure?
- No, it's fine, really.

95
00:09:30,047 --> 00:09:33,403
- You're not just saying that?
- No. Honest.

96
00:09:40,327 --> 00:09:42,522
- I think we should make love.
- You do?

97
00:09:42,847 --> 00:09:44,758
- I do if you do.
- I do.

98
00:09:45,327 --> 00:09:46,282
Okay.

99
00:09:53,447 --> 00:09:56,405
- Would you rather be on top?
- Would you rather be on the bottom?

100
00:09:56,487 --> 00:09:59,638
- Look, either-or, which would you like?
- Whatever you want.

101
00:10:02,407 --> 00:10:04,125
Don't do this to me.

102
00:10:18,687 --> 00:10:19,676
Great.

103
00:10:22,007 --> 00:10:22,962
Come on.

104
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:25,122
Come...

105
00:10:59,087 --> 00:11:00,076
I've won.

106
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:21,879
"Stir vigorously over low flame
for 30 seconds.

107
00:11:26,927 --> 00:11:29,566
"Be careful not to stir too vigorously...

108
00:11:30,247 --> 00:11:32,841
"as this will cause the sauce
to thicken too rapidly."

109
00:11:32,927 --> 00:11:33,882
Oh, my God.

110
00:11:34,767 --> 00:11:36,485
Please don't do this.

111
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,961
- Way to go, butt face.
- Oh, no.

112
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:42,522
Dickhead.

113
00:11:45,407 --> 00:11:47,284
"Add three eggs."

114
00:11:47,687 --> 00:11:50,520
That's it. Table is done. Can I go now?

115
00:11:50,607 --> 00:11:53,599
Honey, would you get me
three eggs, please?

116
00:11:57,247 --> 00:12:00,444
A whole week without you and Dad.
I don't know what we'll do.

117
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,363
I guess we'll just
have to trash the house.

118
00:12:03,447 --> 00:12:05,119
Hurry up with those eggs, wise guy.

119
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,636
- Hey, Mum. Want to see me juggle?
- What?

120
00:12:07,847 --> 00:12:09,724
Don't do that.

121
00:12:14,607 --> 00:12:18,122
- Are you all right?
- Look, Mum. It didn't even break.

122
00:12:18,207 --> 00:12:19,162
Great.

123
00:12:26,327 --> 00:12:27,840
I got it, Mum.

124
00:12:33,327 --> 00:12:35,124
I got it, Mum.

125
00:12:38,247 --> 00:12:39,282
Great.

126
00:12:51,087 --> 00:12:54,318
That was delicious, honey.
You really outdid yourself.

127
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:57,763
It was nothing.
Just something I threw together.

128
00:13:02,287 --> 00:13:04,881
All right, what's the surprise?

129
00:13:05,927 --> 00:13:09,966
- Did somebody get straight A's?
- Yes, Dad, somebody did.

130
00:13:10,807 --> 00:13:13,605
But unfortunately,
he couldn't be here tonight.

131
00:13:20,087 --> 00:13:21,759
I won the contest.

132
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:24,519
Oh, that.

133
00:13:25,247 --> 00:13:28,000
That's great. That's terrific.

134
00:13:29,087 --> 00:13:32,841
Hey, hey. I think that deserves a toast.

135
00:13:34,687 --> 00:13:36,882
To Mum.

136
00:13:38,767 --> 00:13:41,281
Really put a lot of thought
into that one, Dad.

137
00:13:47,447 --> 00:13:50,166
So what did you win?
I assume you won something.

138
00:13:50,847 --> 00:13:54,237
We won a free trip to Paris, France...

139
00:13:54,327 --> 00:13:58,320
all expenses paid for two.
We leave Sunday. Can you believe it?

140
00:13:58,407 --> 00:14:01,922
- I can't believe it myself.
- Sunday? This Sunday?

141
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:05,637
I know it's short notice, but they're
giving this luncheon on Tuesday...

142
00:14:05,727 --> 00:14:08,958
at this famous restaurant,
Tour d'Argent, in my honour.

143
00:14:11,287 --> 00:14:14,597
We'll be staying at
the romantic Hôtel des Artistes...

144
00:14:14,727 --> 00:14:16,957
for a whole week. Can you believe it?

145
00:14:17,047 --> 00:14:20,483
Darling, I think you're getting
a little ahead of yourself here.

146
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:23,842
I really think we need
to think this thing over.

147
00:14:25,127 --> 00:14:28,483
This is the chance of a lifetime.

148
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:31,877
I know. It's a terrific opportunity.

149
00:14:34,847 --> 00:14:38,556
Why don't we have dessert
and talk about it later?

150
00:15:06,887 --> 00:15:08,002
Voilà.

151
00:15:10,087 --> 00:15:13,284
You don't seem to understand.
I cannot just pack up and leave.

152
00:15:13,367 --> 00:15:17,280
I know, but it would be a chance
for the two of us to be alone together...

153
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:19,403
in the most romantic city in the world.

154
00:15:19,487 --> 00:15:22,160
That's half the reason I stayed up
all those nights working.

155
00:15:22,727 --> 00:15:25,446
I'm not asking for six months.
You can take a week.

156
00:15:25,527 --> 00:15:28,439
Cathy, you have no idea
what I can or cannot take.

157
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:36,003
- Honey, we need this time together.
- This is the worst possible time for me.

158
00:15:36,087 --> 00:15:39,477
No, it is not. You're always this busy,
and you'll always be this busy.

159
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:40,886
And that is the way you like it.

160
00:15:40,967 --> 00:15:44,323
Look, I'm not the problem,
and don't make it seem like I am.

161
00:15:45,007 --> 00:15:47,965
All they'll do is to give you a plaque
and a pat on the back.

162
00:15:48,287 --> 00:15:51,199
I don't mean to make light of it,
but that's really all it is.

163
00:15:51,287 --> 00:15:54,040
- I can't give up a week's work for that.
- All right.

164
00:15:54,127 --> 00:15:56,721
I'll just get somebody in
to take care of you and the boys.

165
00:15:56,807 --> 00:15:59,446
- You won't even know I'm gone.
- You can't be serious.

166
00:15:59,807 --> 00:16:03,243
- What do you mean?
- You're planning on going without me?

167
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:06,165
- Do you want to go?
- No, I can't.

168
00:16:07,247 --> 00:16:09,283
- I can.
- No, you can't.

169
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:11,036
Kevin.

170
00:16:16,927 --> 00:16:20,317
I earned this trip. You have no right
to keep me from going.

171
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:25,717
Honey, if you want to go to Paris
that bad...

172
00:16:26,447 --> 00:16:29,598
save up and go in three, four years.

173
00:16:30,807 --> 00:16:33,560
I tell you what. Let's not make
a decision on it right now.

174
00:16:33,647 --> 00:16:35,239
Let's just think on it.

175
00:16:35,687 --> 00:16:38,406
I'm sure things will be
a lot clearer in the morning. Okay?

176
00:16:41,927 --> 00:16:44,043
- Cathy?
- Okay.

177
00:16:47,487 --> 00:16:48,681
Where are you going?

178
00:16:48,767 --> 00:16:50,803
I'm just going downstairs
to read for a while.

179
00:16:50,887 --> 00:16:52,320
- Cathy.
- What?

180
00:16:52,607 --> 00:16:55,644
- I don't want you to go.
- I'm just going downstairs.

181
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:56,995
You know what I mean.

182
00:16:57,687 --> 00:17:01,521
It would be selfish, childish,
and irresponsible of you to leave...

183
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,243
but I'm not going to tell you not to go.

184
00:17:04,327 --> 00:17:06,397
I'm going to leave that decision
up to you.

185
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:09,442
Love you.

186
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:22,798
Leave the clubs.
We'll get them after we eat.

187
00:17:22,887 --> 00:17:25,606
I still can't believe
you kept Cathy from going to Paris.

188
00:17:26,247 --> 00:17:27,805
If Phyllis had won that contest...

189
00:17:27,887 --> 00:17:30,685
it would have taken me and
the National Guard to keep her home.

190
00:17:30,767 --> 00:17:33,565
I hear it takes the National Guard
just to keep her satisfied.

191
00:17:35,527 --> 00:17:36,516
Very funny.

192
00:17:40,207 --> 00:17:43,961
The trick is you never lose control.

193
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:48,763
You don't yell. You don't scream.
You just help them make your decision.

194
00:17:54,247 --> 00:17:58,206
I guess the real trick is
never let them enter contests.

195
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,482
Bonsoir.

196
00:19:21,767 --> 00:19:22,882
Après vous.

197
00:20:10,247 --> 00:20:13,717
"Cathy, that was a childish, selfish,
and irresponsible thing to do.

198
00:20:17,327 --> 00:20:18,760
"The most important thing, kid...

199
00:20:20,367 --> 00:20:23,598
"is that you're doing something
that you like to do."

200
00:20:33,007 --> 00:20:36,477
Madame, your limousine is ready.

201
00:20:37,607 --> 00:20:38,562
My limousine?

202
00:20:39,687 --> 00:20:41,882
To take you
to the Rebecca Ryan luncheon.

203
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,681
Madame, we have some extra time.

204
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:58,084
Perhaps, you would like to see
some of the classic sights of Paris.

205
00:20:58,527 --> 00:21:00,438
Yes, I'd like that very much.

206
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:36,642
Madame.

207
00:21:38,887 --> 00:21:42,243
It was a wonderful ride, really.
Merci beaucoup.

208
00:21:42,327 --> 00:21:43,840
- No, madame.
- Really, no, it's just...

209
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:47,044
I want to walk a little
and take some pictures.

210
00:21:47,127 --> 00:21:50,244
But your luncheon. The Tour d'Argent
is this way, one block.

211
00:21:50,327 --> 00:21:52,795
Really? Great. I'll walk.

212
00:21:52,887 --> 00:21:54,957
Thank you. Merci. Au revoir.

213
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:07,356
Hey.

214
00:22:09,487 --> 00:22:10,442
Stop.

215
00:22:19,127 --> 00:22:21,960
Marguerite, you want the whole world
to see you?

216
00:22:23,007 --> 00:22:25,237
Terrible. Awful.

217
00:22:26,007 --> 00:22:28,282
Why does it always happen to me?

218
00:22:30,407 --> 00:22:33,285
My God. I've got to call an ambulance.

219
00:22:41,207 --> 00:22:44,165
- Dimitri is Rebecca's best friend.
- Tour d'Argent is this way.

220
00:22:44,247 --> 00:22:46,715
- Chance of a lifetime.
- I don't want you to go.

221
00:22:46,807 --> 00:22:49,275
- It'll be like a second honeymoon.
- He loves boobs, Mum.

222
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:52,279
- I got it, Mum.
- Damn you, Rebecca Ryan.

223
00:22:52,367 --> 00:22:53,322
To Mum.

224
00:23:05,207 --> 00:23:07,846
Miss McMann, I just love your books.

225
00:23:08,327 --> 00:23:10,966
I named my daughter Rebecca.

226
00:23:11,447 --> 00:23:15,520
Yes, I tried that with my son.
He wasn't amused.

227
00:23:16,607 --> 00:23:17,596
Thank you.

228
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,479
You're awake. I'm so glad.

229
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:31,284
I'm so sorry it happened.

230
00:23:31,967 --> 00:23:35,516
I feel just terrible, awful beyond belief.

231
00:23:36,447 --> 00:23:40,565
But thank God you are all right.
No broken bones.

232
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:44,125
Just a bump on your beautiful head.

233
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:46,918
I'm Don Carlos Dominguez...

234
00:23:47,167 --> 00:23:50,523
His Majesty's ambassador from Spain...

235
00:23:51,367 --> 00:23:52,641
at your service.

236
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:56,916
Whom do I have the pleasure
of addressing?

237
00:23:58,287 --> 00:24:01,120
You know perfectly well
who I am, you snake.

238
00:24:01,207 --> 00:24:02,879
Snake? Moi?

239
00:24:14,967 --> 00:24:17,003
- Cathy Palmer has disappeared.
- Who?

240
00:24:17,607 --> 00:24:21,202
- Cathy Palmer.
- I thought your wife's name was Joanna.

241
00:24:21,567 --> 00:24:24,639
Cathy Palmer is the woman
who won the Rebecca Ryan contest...

242
00:24:24,847 --> 00:24:27,645
which is why we're all here today
at this luncheon.

243
00:24:27,847 --> 00:24:31,840
She's a smart girl. She obviously knows
how boring these things really are.

244
00:24:38,807 --> 00:24:41,640
- You shouldn't be up.
- What have you done with my clothes?

245
00:24:41,727 --> 00:24:43,240
Those are your clothes.

246
00:24:43,447 --> 00:24:44,402
Don't be absurd.

247
00:24:44,487 --> 00:24:47,240
Rebecca Ryan wouldn't be caught dead
in something like this.

248
00:24:49,727 --> 00:24:52,002
I think I'd better get a doctor.

249
00:25:00,487 --> 00:25:01,886
I guess it'll have to do.

250
00:25:29,847 --> 00:25:32,998
- I'll take it. And that.
- Very good.

251
00:25:35,207 --> 00:25:37,243
Another two for Miss Ryan.

252
00:25:38,407 --> 00:25:39,362
Hello?

253
00:25:42,127 --> 00:25:44,118
I need to inquire
about one of your guests.

254
00:25:44,847 --> 00:25:46,803
- Does Rebecca Ryan live here?
- Yes.

255
00:25:46,887 --> 00:25:48,400
Just a minute, please.

256
00:25:52,007 --> 00:25:53,759
Does Rebecca Ryan live here?

257
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:59,517
You idiot. Of course she lives here.
Everybody knows that.

258
00:26:04,207 --> 00:26:08,200
You idiot. Of course she lives here.
Everybody knows that.

259
00:27:02,207 --> 00:27:04,437
- Bonjour, madame.
- Thank you.

260
00:27:07,687 --> 00:27:08,722
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

261
00:27:08,807 --> 00:27:09,842
Bonjour, madame.

262
00:27:52,687 --> 00:27:55,724
- Certainly took your time getting here.
- I'm lucky I'm here at all.

263
00:27:58,127 --> 00:28:00,800
I don't know how much
Malcolm told you about the job.

264
00:28:01,367 --> 00:28:04,200
Nothing much to it really.
Just a bit of filing, a few letters.

265
00:28:04,287 --> 00:28:07,006
- Any calls?
- No, just secretarial.

266
00:28:09,927 --> 00:28:12,361
- Come in.
- No, just...

267
00:28:12,807 --> 00:28:13,956
Sorry.

268
00:28:25,247 --> 00:28:27,238
I say... Excuse me. No, I'm afraid...

269
00:28:27,487 --> 00:28:30,160
What on earth is all...
Don't bring all that...

270
00:28:33,487 --> 00:28:36,399
- Fine. Just everybody come in.
- Put them in the bedroom.

271
00:28:40,447 --> 00:28:44,156
- What are they doing?
- I missed the boat, but my bags didn't.

272
00:28:44,247 --> 00:28:46,397
- Boat?
- Yes. I ran into a little trouble.

273
00:28:46,807 --> 00:28:50,163
- Or should I say, it ran into me.
- Would you mind telling me...

274
00:28:50,607 --> 00:28:51,676
What do you mean?

275
00:28:52,727 --> 00:28:53,955
- Not now.
- What?

276
00:28:59,727 --> 00:29:03,402
What are you doing? Excuse me,
would you just close the drawer.

277
00:29:03,487 --> 00:29:07,082
- Is this all there is?
- Why do you want to know?

278
00:29:07,167 --> 00:29:09,840
Now, don't start pinching pennies
on me now, Dimitri.

279
00:29:09,927 --> 00:29:14,125
I've got more important things
on my mind. Merci.

280
00:29:16,927 --> 00:29:19,122
$300.

281
00:29:19,567 --> 00:29:21,285
- Au revoir.
- Au revoir, madame.

282
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:26,485
Why did you call me Dimitri?

283
00:29:26,607 --> 00:29:29,326
Priest never showed up.
I think we scared him off.

284
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:31,239
Malcolm is behind this, isn't he?

285
00:29:31,327 --> 00:29:34,763
I don't know who is behind it yet,
but the future of life on this planet...

286
00:29:34,847 --> 00:29:38,283
may very well depend on my finding out.

287
00:29:38,407 --> 00:29:39,726
Oh, Lord.

288
00:29:44,127 --> 00:29:45,958
Time is ticking away.

289
00:29:46,607 --> 00:29:50,486
I wasted two valuable hours
getting out of the hospital.

290
00:29:50,927 --> 00:29:53,316
- You escaped?
- Just barely.

291
00:29:53,567 --> 00:29:55,523
That black Citroën was no accident.

292
00:29:55,607 --> 00:29:57,837
Just another crude attempt
to get rid of...

293
00:30:01,087 --> 00:30:05,160
- Rebecca Ryan.
- Rebecca Ryan, I see.

294
00:30:05,247 --> 00:30:07,158
They obviously think I know something.

295
00:30:07,247 --> 00:30:09,397
It's something worth killing you for,
obviously.

296
00:30:09,487 --> 00:30:10,522
Right.

297
00:30:10,607 --> 00:30:14,361
My God. The Embassy party.
It's tonight. Of course.

298
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:18,477
No wonder they tried to kill me.

299
00:30:19,607 --> 00:30:22,883
I suspect my arrival there
will surprise some of our old friends.

300
00:30:23,487 --> 00:30:26,206
- I want you to come with me.
- I imagine you do.

301
00:30:28,367 --> 00:30:31,484
I suppose I could stand here all night
asking you who's responsible.

302
00:30:31,567 --> 00:30:33,159
You wouldn't tell me, would you?

303
00:30:37,967 --> 00:30:40,720
If I told you everything,
you'd be dead before you knew it.

304
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,679
You're very good, you know.

305
00:30:44,767 --> 00:30:47,486
You're confident, you're convincing,
you're...

306
00:30:48,167 --> 00:30:49,282
undressing.

307
00:30:50,087 --> 00:30:53,318
Be a dear and fix me a martini
while I change.

308
00:31:25,727 --> 00:31:27,445
Mr. McMann?

309
00:31:28,647 --> 00:31:29,636
Yes.

310
00:31:29,727 --> 00:31:33,037
I'm sorry I'm late. The metro was...

311
00:31:33,487 --> 00:31:34,806
You're the secretary.

312
00:31:34,887 --> 00:31:38,004
I'm so excited to be working for you.

313
00:31:38,527 --> 00:31:41,644
I just love your mother's...

314
00:31:42,727 --> 00:31:44,001
books.

315
00:31:44,207 --> 00:31:46,402
Yes. Well, look, here.

316
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:49,638
It's jolly decent of you to have come.
Thank you so much.

317
00:31:49,727 --> 00:31:51,763
I'll give your regards to my mother.

318
00:31:51,847 --> 00:31:53,485
- Good day.
- Good day, sir.

319
00:31:58,407 --> 00:31:59,396
I bet it was...

320
00:31:59,647 --> 00:32:03,276
Charles. It was... No, it wasn't.

321
00:32:03,367 --> 00:32:05,198
It was Jean Paul. Wasn't it?

322
00:32:05,287 --> 00:32:08,006
He's trying to get back at me
for the time I persuaded him...

323
00:32:08,087 --> 00:32:11,079
to promise to marry
two different women at the same time.

324
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:15,122
The personification of mortal fear.

325
00:32:18,927 --> 00:32:20,440
What's wrong? You all right?

326
00:32:24,007 --> 00:32:26,521
Why don't we stop playing this game?

327
00:32:27,567 --> 00:32:30,525
You've more than earned your money.
Tell me your real name.

328
00:32:31,047 --> 00:32:33,686
- Don Carlos Dominguez.
- The Spanish Ambassador?

329
00:32:33,767 --> 00:32:36,042
He's the snake
who tried to run me down.

330
00:32:37,127 --> 00:32:39,163
I thought
we were going to stop this game.

331
00:33:05,807 --> 00:33:09,004
These diplomats will stab you
in the back every time.

332
00:33:11,687 --> 00:33:14,326
You can count on me up to here.

333
00:33:15,567 --> 00:33:19,560
- I will never turn my back on you.
- Thank you very much, my dear friend.

334
00:33:24,207 --> 00:33:27,165
- Marguerite.
- There you are. At last.

335
00:33:27,847 --> 00:33:28,996
Bonsoir.

336
00:33:29,247 --> 00:33:32,637
Aren't you going to introduce us
to your new friend?

337
00:33:34,047 --> 00:33:36,003
Yes. Marguerite Lasueur.

338
00:33:37,127 --> 00:33:39,561
Her husband, Rafael Lasueur,
French Foreign Minister.

339
00:33:39,647 --> 00:33:40,602
Enchanté.

340
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:42,484
Ivan Stanovonovitch,
the Russian Ambassador.

341
00:33:42,567 --> 00:33:43,886
Na zdorov'e.

342
00:33:45,327 --> 00:33:47,522
Don Carlos Dominguez,
the Spanish Ambassador.

343
00:33:47,607 --> 00:33:49,802
- May I present...
- No, you may not. Excuse me.

344
00:33:49,887 --> 00:33:50,922
Oh, my God.

345
00:33:55,287 --> 00:33:57,642
The pressure is on.

346
00:33:58,607 --> 00:34:00,882
Bravo, madame.

347
00:34:00,967 --> 00:34:04,357
I never much liked that fascist donkey.

348
00:34:04,447 --> 00:34:06,915
Will you do me the honour, Miss...

349
00:34:07,007 --> 00:34:09,885
Ryan, Rebecca Ryan.

350
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:12,435
And I can drink any man here
under the table.

351
00:34:45,287 --> 00:34:47,881
I drink to Rebecca Ryan.

352
00:34:47,967 --> 00:34:51,403
She's the first real woman
I have met in all of France.

353
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:11,967
- Having fun?
- Oh, yes.

354
00:35:13,087 --> 00:35:15,362
Who's that man?

355
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:16,766
Sorry.

356
00:35:19,847 --> 00:35:23,635
That is Victor Marchand,
he's the leader of the Opposition party...

357
00:35:23,727 --> 00:35:27,720
and he is very important,
so stay away from him.

358
00:35:34,367 --> 00:35:37,723
Pieces are finally beginning
to fall in place.

359
00:35:40,047 --> 00:35:43,005
- May I cut in?
- By all means.

360
00:35:46,567 --> 00:35:49,718
I don't know what you hope to gain
with this little game of yours.

361
00:35:49,807 --> 00:35:53,038
If you continue, you will get more
than you bargained for.

362
00:35:53,127 --> 00:35:54,924
Of that you can be sure.

363
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,159
What's with her name?

364
00:35:58,087 --> 00:36:01,284
Drumming up more publicity
for your mother's books?

365
00:36:01,607 --> 00:36:03,120
More vodka.

366
00:36:04,127 --> 00:36:06,436
You are a very interesting woman.

367
00:36:06,527 --> 00:36:09,325
You are so...

368
00:36:17,247 --> 00:36:20,125
Yes, it's a mixture of English
and Bantu tongues...

369
00:36:20,207 --> 00:36:23,404
spoken in the mining towns
of South Africa.

370
00:36:23,567 --> 00:36:24,761
But German...

371
00:36:25,247 --> 00:36:27,397
Wasn't it Nietzsche who said:

372
00:36:33,967 --> 00:36:35,480
It's deep, isn't it?

373
00:36:47,127 --> 00:36:48,480
Oh, Lord.

374
00:36:54,727 --> 00:36:56,843
What on earth did you say to him?

375
00:36:56,927 --> 00:36:59,760
The wheels are in motion.
There's no turning back now.

376
00:36:59,847 --> 00:37:02,441
Stay here. Don't move. I'll be right back.

377
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:09,235
Above all, don't talk to anybody.

378
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:40,045
"Terminate yourself immediately."

379
00:38:28,207 --> 00:38:29,356
Don Carlos?

380
00:38:37,127 --> 00:38:39,277
Oh, my God.

381
00:38:49,047 --> 00:38:51,083
Don Carlos, are you all right?

382
00:38:52,967 --> 00:38:55,720
- What happened?
- I've got to get out of here.

383
00:38:57,767 --> 00:39:00,998
- Don Carlos, please, just one second.
- That woman!

384
00:39:01,327 --> 00:39:04,080
How could she... How did she know?

385
00:39:04,327 --> 00:39:06,966
Whatever she said, she didn't mean it.

386
00:39:07,047 --> 00:39:08,366
My life is over.

387
00:39:08,447 --> 00:39:11,245
Agents are probably onto me
right this very second.

388
00:39:11,327 --> 00:39:14,478
I didn't want to spy for them,
but I had to.

389
00:39:14,607 --> 00:39:16,245
The money was too good.

390
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:20,436
I must cite diplomatic immunity
before I am a dead fish.

391
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:26,203
What exactly did she tell you?

392
00:39:28,087 --> 00:39:29,042
Wait...

393
00:39:29,807 --> 00:39:32,844
maybe you are one of them right now.

394
00:39:53,247 --> 00:39:54,726
Na zdorov'e.

395
00:39:59,447 --> 00:40:02,086
- Hi.
- Hello.

396
00:40:03,407 --> 00:40:04,556
I know.

397
00:40:05,847 --> 00:40:08,042
You do? How wonderful.

398
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,045
What do you know?

399
00:40:11,407 --> 00:40:13,284
I...

400
00:40:13,367 --> 00:40:16,359
know that you are involved in a plot...

401
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:19,515
that could very well cost you your life.

402
00:40:21,167 --> 00:40:24,000
Excuse me, Victor, we were just off.
Weren't we?

403
00:40:24,087 --> 00:40:25,679
- Come on.
- We are?

404
00:40:27,647 --> 00:40:31,117
I will do everything in my power
to see that justice is done.

405
00:40:31,567 --> 00:40:34,923
Before it's all over,
you'll be madly in love with me.

406
00:40:51,127 --> 00:40:54,836
- Good evening, madame.
- It's a glorious evening, isn't it?

407
00:41:21,967 --> 00:41:23,878
Don't come near me or I'll jump.

408
00:41:33,327 --> 00:41:36,000
Nothing you do
can further embarrass me.

409
00:41:45,247 --> 00:41:46,202
Right.

410
00:42:00,647 --> 00:42:02,126
Jacqueline.

411
00:42:02,847 --> 00:42:03,916
Hello.

412
00:42:07,687 --> 00:42:09,006
You know...

413
00:42:13,527 --> 00:42:17,122
The most extraordinary thing
happened...

414
00:42:17,207 --> 00:42:18,560
Amazing, really.

415
00:42:30,567 --> 00:42:31,886
Good night.

416
00:42:32,887 --> 00:42:36,880
- She seems like a lovely girl.
- Yes, she's...

417
00:42:38,527 --> 00:42:39,880
- Indeed.
- Lovely.

418
00:42:44,327 --> 00:42:46,921
Look, it's the bedroom.

419
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:52,122
- I'm putting you down now, all right?
- Oh, good.

420
00:42:53,327 --> 00:42:55,124
Okay. Just let's get this...

421
00:42:55,487 --> 00:42:58,320
Oh, yes, it is very wet.

422
00:42:58,967 --> 00:43:00,161
Don't... Let me just...

423
00:43:00,247 --> 00:43:03,444
- I'm missing an arm.
- I know, it's all right, because it's wet.

424
00:43:03,527 --> 00:43:06,325
- Oh, my God, I'm missing an arm.
- Just a minute. There.

425
00:43:06,407 --> 00:43:08,443
Oh, good. So glad to see it.

426
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:11,963
I can get rid of this, I think.

427
00:43:23,407 --> 00:43:25,682
Oh, no. Hello?

428
00:43:27,807 --> 00:43:29,126
Anybody in?

429
00:43:33,207 --> 00:43:36,438
You have to take this off, you know,
it's absolutely soaking.

430
00:43:38,967 --> 00:43:40,116
Come on.

431
00:43:41,927 --> 00:43:45,556
I can undo this, all right?
You'll have to manage the rest yourself.

432
00:43:45,967 --> 00:43:50,119
"Prince Rupert slowly unbuttoned
Rebecca's blouse...

433
00:43:51,807 --> 00:43:55,277
"slipping his hand underneath
and caressing her smooth skin."

434
00:43:57,007 --> 00:43:58,201
Yes, well...

435
00:44:01,367 --> 00:44:04,006
I'll just undo this.

436
00:44:06,887 --> 00:44:09,606
There we are. Now that's undone.
Come on, now.

437
00:44:27,127 --> 00:44:29,243
Right. Thank you. Thank you very much.

438
00:44:31,887 --> 00:44:34,037
Don't be angry, Kevin.

439
00:44:35,327 --> 00:44:39,320
- I was just trying to have a good time.
- All right.

440
00:44:42,167 --> 00:44:43,759
Kevin? Who the hell is Kevin?

441
00:44:51,767 --> 00:44:53,678
Hello?

442
00:44:53,767 --> 00:44:56,201
Hello, it's Malcolm Hargraves here,
in Paris.

443
00:44:56,967 --> 00:44:59,765
I was wondering
if you'd heard from Mrs. Palmer?

444
00:44:59,847 --> 00:45:02,645
No. Why? Is something wrong?

445
00:45:03,127 --> 00:45:05,004
She just seems to have...

446
00:45:05,087 --> 00:45:06,281
disappeared.

447
00:45:06,367 --> 00:45:08,927
No, she would never do anything
like that.

448
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:10,886
She's a perfectly sensible girl.

449
00:45:10,967 --> 00:45:13,322
That may be. I think you should be here.

450
00:45:13,847 --> 00:45:15,246
Just a second.

451
00:46:06,167 --> 00:46:09,477
"Rebecca Ryan, 2,000 francs."

452
00:46:12,167 --> 00:46:15,603
"Rebecca Ryan, 8,000 francs."

453
00:46:16,887 --> 00:46:21,597
"Rebecca Ryan, 37,000 francs."

454
00:46:39,607 --> 00:46:42,485
I think we have to have a little talk.

455
00:46:42,807 --> 00:46:44,798
I think you might be
in some sort of trouble.

456
00:46:44,887 --> 00:46:48,323
And I don't know what it is.
And I'm not sure that you do either.

457
00:46:48,407 --> 00:46:52,082
We all have secrets.
I can understand that.

458
00:46:52,167 --> 00:46:55,682
But I am beginning to worry about you.
I don't want you to be hurt.

459
00:46:56,567 --> 00:46:58,717
So what I propose is this.

460
00:46:58,807 --> 00:47:01,605
That I take you to see
this jolly good chap I know.

461
00:47:01,687 --> 00:47:04,485
He is a sort of doctor.

462
00:47:04,887 --> 00:47:08,516
And I think he might be able to help you
work your way through this.

463
00:47:09,207 --> 00:47:11,596
- What do you say?
- What?

464
00:47:15,087 --> 00:47:17,920
I said, I think you might be
in some sort of trouble.

465
00:47:18,767 --> 00:47:22,123
Trouble is my middle name.
The Spanish Ambassador confessed.

466
00:47:22,207 --> 00:47:24,402
- I've got to warn Victor.
- Warn Victor about what?

467
00:47:24,487 --> 00:47:25,522
Yes, it's all right there.

468
00:47:26,647 --> 00:47:28,877
Victor's addressing the assembly,
even as we speak.

469
00:47:28,967 --> 00:47:31,686
Let's hope that his life doesn't end
before his speech does.

470
00:47:31,767 --> 00:47:33,883
- What are you looking for?
- Your keys.

471
00:47:35,007 --> 00:47:38,682
- Could I ask about these receipts?
- What about them?

472
00:47:38,767 --> 00:47:41,235
Well, I don't mean to pry or anything.

473
00:47:41,327 --> 00:47:44,080
- Is this your signature?
- Yes, I believe it is.

474
00:47:44,527 --> 00:47:48,998
- This thing have any pockets in it?
- Yes, and until now, no rips.

475
00:47:49,287 --> 00:47:52,006
- Where are the keys to your car?
- The concierge has them.

476
00:47:52,087 --> 00:47:55,318
- Could we just straighten this out?
- Stop fussing, Dimitri...

477
00:47:55,407 --> 00:47:58,126
and get some rest. You look dreadful.

478
00:47:59,767 --> 00:48:03,282
Yes, but we are talking here
about thousands of francs.

479
00:48:03,367 --> 00:48:06,803
I mean, dollars. And what's all this stuff
about the Spanish Ambassador?

480
00:48:06,887 --> 00:48:09,685
What did you say to Don Carlos...

481
00:48:12,047 --> 00:48:14,003
My car. She got my car.

482
00:48:28,887 --> 00:48:30,366
Follow that car.

483
00:48:30,887 --> 00:48:32,559
I don't believe I said that.

484
00:48:49,327 --> 00:48:52,160
Rebecca.

485
00:48:59,767 --> 00:49:02,122
Just a second. Will you wait, damn it?

486
00:49:02,647 --> 00:49:05,957
And is not the criminal
a human being first?

487
00:49:06,327 --> 00:49:09,080
Does he not still maintain
his basic human dignity?

488
00:49:09,607 --> 00:49:13,600
Is it not up to us, the state,
to protect his dignity?

489
00:49:14,087 --> 00:49:17,875
I say, if we do not protect his dignity...

490
00:49:17,967 --> 00:49:21,243
- that would tarnish our own.
- Excuse me. Sorry.

491
00:49:21,607 --> 00:49:23,916
- Victor.
- Ultimately, society...

492
00:49:24,007 --> 00:49:25,963
will not be judged by the...

493
00:49:27,127 --> 00:49:30,244
- the great buildings...
- No.

494
00:49:30,887 --> 00:49:35,039
...or the great monuments
it leaves behind...

495
00:49:35,247 --> 00:49:37,761
but rather by the way...

496
00:49:38,167 --> 00:49:41,364
it treats its most disadvantaged citizens.

497
00:49:41,447 --> 00:49:43,165
I say...

498
00:49:43,247 --> 00:49:46,205
I say, let us build a monument
to the human spirit.

499
00:49:46,287 --> 00:49:47,800
I say...

500
00:49:47,887 --> 00:49:51,562
- What are you doing?
- Hi.

501
00:49:54,127 --> 00:49:56,687
Saving Victor's life.

502
00:49:57,847 --> 00:49:59,599
We... Sorry.

503
00:49:59,687 --> 00:50:01,166
- We surely...
- Get...

504
00:50:01,247 --> 00:50:03,442
...must recognise that man...
...out.

505
00:50:03,527 --> 00:50:05,563
- Get out.
- That man...

506
00:50:05,647 --> 00:50:09,196
They're going to kill him, Dimitri...

507
00:50:10,127 --> 00:50:12,322
and no one can do
a damn thing about it.

508
00:50:12,407 --> 00:50:14,125
Get out.

509
00:50:15,607 --> 00:50:20,123
- No one except Rebecca Ryan.
- Get out.

510
00:50:21,047 --> 00:50:22,082
Out.

511
00:50:22,487 --> 00:50:24,079
- Thank you.
- Now.

512
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:35,047
Rebecca, don't you think
this has gone far enough?

513
00:50:35,127 --> 00:50:38,005
It's gone too far.
He's already taken the bait.

514
00:50:39,167 --> 00:50:40,725
Just a second. Come on.

515
00:50:42,167 --> 00:50:45,045
Do you understand?
I'm trying to help you.

516
00:50:45,327 --> 00:50:47,761
- I know you're eager to help, Dimitri.
- Well, then.

517
00:50:47,847 --> 00:50:50,281
But this is no time to play the hero.

518
00:50:50,367 --> 00:50:51,277
I am not...

519
00:50:52,727 --> 00:50:53,955
playing the hero.

520
00:50:56,167 --> 00:50:59,762
I'm not playing the hero.
You are playing the God damn...

521
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:11,156
Oh, no.

522
00:51:12,487 --> 00:51:14,717
- I'll handle it.
- Oh, no.

523
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:20,961
- Is this your car, monsieur?
- Yes.

524
00:51:21,047 --> 00:51:23,959
It is impossible to leave it here.
It is not a parking place.

525
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:27,437
Yes, but every second counts
when a man is about to be murdered.

526
00:51:27,887 --> 00:51:29,206
Murder?

527
00:51:29,287 --> 00:51:31,323
No. It loses something
in the translation.

528
00:51:34,807 --> 00:51:37,162
- What murder?
- Tell Capt. Genet not to worry.

529
00:51:37,247 --> 00:51:39,761
Rebecca Ryan's on the case.

530
00:51:46,887 --> 00:51:50,197
Victor's walking into a trap
and he doesn't know it.

531
00:51:50,647 --> 00:51:51,762
Clutch.

532
00:51:51,847 --> 00:51:53,599
I tried to warn him
at the Embassy party...

533
00:51:53,687 --> 00:51:56,042
but he pretended not to know
what I was talking about.

534
00:51:56,127 --> 00:51:58,163
- Who does?
- It's very simple, Dimitri.

535
00:51:58,247 --> 00:51:59,282
Red light.

536
00:51:59,767 --> 00:52:01,325
Red light!

537
00:52:04,847 --> 00:52:05,836
Was that red?

538
00:52:21,687 --> 00:52:22,881
Damn it, Rebecca.

539
00:52:28,447 --> 00:52:30,756
To the park. All right.

540
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,485
Damn it. Don't go, Rebecca.

541
00:52:33,527 --> 00:52:37,202
- Come back. Could we discuss this?
- Not now, Dimitri.

542
00:52:41,447 --> 00:52:42,562
Got a light?

543
00:52:45,087 --> 00:52:46,486
Now, listen.

544
00:52:48,007 --> 00:52:49,565
You're going to get us both arrested.

545
00:52:49,647 --> 00:52:52,400
That is Victor Marchand,
for Christ's sake.

546
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:57,356
And he just made contact.

547
00:52:58,887 --> 00:52:59,842
Dimitri.

548
00:53:00,727 --> 00:53:01,842
Damn it.

549
00:53:03,567 --> 00:53:06,001
- Keep that.
- Merci beaucoup.

550
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:09,042
- There's a hand-off.
- Oh, for God's sake.

551
00:53:09,207 --> 00:53:10,481
Get down.

552
00:53:10,887 --> 00:53:13,117
- Now, look what you have done.
- Look what you did.

553
00:53:13,207 --> 00:53:14,162
- Great.
- Great.

554
00:53:40,727 --> 00:53:43,685
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.

555
00:53:46,767 --> 00:53:49,679
No. Not going in there.

556
00:53:49,767 --> 00:53:52,235
- Somebody's got to protect Victor.
- From you.

557
00:53:53,887 --> 00:53:54,842
What?

558
00:53:57,767 --> 00:53:58,722
I don't...

559
00:54:04,087 --> 00:54:05,645
Victor, wait.

560
00:54:06,807 --> 00:54:09,002
Victor, where are you?

561
00:54:12,687 --> 00:54:14,325
Rebecca.

562
00:54:14,407 --> 00:54:17,365
Hey, wait. I need to talk to you.

563
00:54:28,167 --> 00:54:29,316
God.

564
00:54:30,167 --> 00:54:32,886
- For heaven's sake.
- You're lucky you're still alive.

565
00:54:32,967 --> 00:54:35,606
- I'm on a streak. Come on.
- Listen.

566
00:54:39,167 --> 00:54:40,839
I'm sorry. What?

567
00:54:43,207 --> 00:54:46,643
Victor, it's all right.
She's not dangerous.

568
00:54:48,247 --> 00:54:49,805
She's just a little confused.

569
00:54:59,007 --> 00:55:00,235
Can we just...

570
00:55:00,327 --> 00:55:01,362
Wait, Rebecca.

571
00:55:02,367 --> 00:55:05,598
- Just stop.
- Victor, wait.

572
00:55:07,367 --> 00:55:10,837
Victor, don't be afraid. I'm here to help.

573
00:55:16,887 --> 00:55:19,037
- Listen.
- What the hell was that?

574
00:55:19,887 --> 00:55:22,003
Victor. Oh, my God,
I hope we're not too late.

575
00:55:22,087 --> 00:55:24,920
- I'm taking you out of here.
- This is no time to worry about me.

576
00:55:25,007 --> 00:55:27,282
A man's life is at stake.
Would you let go of me?

577
00:55:27,367 --> 00:55:29,119
No, I'm taking you to the hospital.

578
00:55:29,207 --> 00:55:31,801
I really hate to do this, Dimitri.

579
00:55:33,327 --> 00:55:34,885
What?

580
00:55:37,407 --> 00:55:40,046
Someday you'll thank me for that.

581
00:55:46,247 --> 00:55:47,202
Sorry.

582
00:56:02,927 --> 00:56:03,916
Hey.

583
00:56:07,247 --> 00:56:08,805
No, wait.

584
00:56:14,567 --> 00:56:15,682
I'm here to help.

585
00:56:17,447 --> 00:56:18,846
Wait.

586
00:56:23,927 --> 00:56:28,045
The priest. Of course, the priest.

587
00:56:31,367 --> 00:56:32,561
Father.

588
00:56:44,847 --> 00:56:46,326
Wait. Father.

589
00:56:51,167 --> 00:56:52,122
Wait.

590
00:56:53,727 --> 00:56:55,638
Father, we haven't much time.

591
00:56:56,247 --> 00:56:58,807
You have to break the sanctity
of the confessional...

592
00:56:58,887 --> 00:57:01,606
- and tell me who the killer is.
- I had to do it.

593
00:57:01,687 --> 00:57:04,565
I'm sorry, Father, for the mistake.

594
00:57:18,007 --> 00:57:19,440
Entrez.

595
00:57:20,927 --> 00:57:23,236
Don't tell them anything, Dimitri.

596
00:57:23,327 --> 00:57:26,603
If the police get involved now
they will just foul things up.

597
00:57:27,007 --> 00:57:28,406
Come now.

598
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:32,126
Let's not have any secrets between us,
Miss...

599
00:57:32,207 --> 00:57:33,196
Ryan.

600
00:57:35,607 --> 00:57:36,642
Rebecca Ryan.

601
00:57:38,607 --> 00:57:40,677
- And you, sir?
- No, thanks. I don't smoke.

602
00:57:40,767 --> 00:57:42,883
- No. Your name.
- Sorry.

603
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:45,242
Alan McMann.

604
00:57:46,127 --> 00:57:50,564
Dimitri, I didn't mean
that you had to lie about your name.

605
00:57:51,247 --> 00:57:53,044
Inspector...

606
00:57:53,367 --> 00:57:56,086
there's something that
you'll want to know about this woman.

607
00:57:56,167 --> 00:57:58,317
Maybe there is something
I should know about you?

608
00:57:58,407 --> 00:57:59,317
What?

609
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:02,604
But first, I want to know about the priest.

610
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:03,642
Right.

611
00:58:04,567 --> 00:58:08,276
Miss Ryan, suppose you tell me
exactly what happened.

612
00:58:08,367 --> 00:58:11,006
- Well there's this...
- No. Miss Ryan.

613
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:14,837
- Well...
- And don't leave anything out.

614
00:58:16,767 --> 00:58:18,485
Okay.

615
00:58:34,287 --> 00:58:36,164
You know, you haven't said...

616
00:58:36,487 --> 00:58:38,796
a word since we left the police station.

617
00:58:39,567 --> 00:58:41,205
Is something wrong?

618
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:46,485
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thank you, no. It's fine.

619
00:58:46,567 --> 00:58:47,920
Thank you.

620
00:58:56,847 --> 00:58:59,281
I want you to listen to me, Dimitri.

621
00:59:01,967 --> 00:59:05,357
You know,
life is full of these little ups and downs.

622
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:08,397
Pain is not something to be afraid of.

623
00:59:08,807 --> 00:59:12,641
I'm glad I've gone through pain,
because it teaches one courage.

624
00:59:15,167 --> 00:59:18,637
I've seen a lot of men shot.
I've seen a lot of men killed.

625
00:59:18,727 --> 00:59:20,922
Some of them by my own hand.

626
00:59:21,007 --> 00:59:23,680
And I guess it's something
you never get used to.

627
00:59:31,447 --> 00:59:33,677
We're lucky we have each other.

628
00:59:35,447 --> 00:59:38,678
You know, in a funny way,
you've ruined me.

629
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:40,959
I can never marry.

630
00:59:41,367 --> 00:59:44,245
Even though you're the way you are.

631
00:59:44,807 --> 00:59:47,401
Marriage pales next to our friendship.

632
00:59:47,767 --> 00:59:52,079
I don't know a husband and wife
that communicate as well as we do.

633
01:00:10,527 --> 01:00:12,085
As a matter of fact...

634
01:00:14,967 --> 01:00:17,037
I don't know a husband and wife...

635
01:00:18,647 --> 01:00:20,319
that communicate...

636
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:22,322
at all.

637
01:00:29,207 --> 01:00:30,925
What you are feeling right now...

638
01:00:31,007 --> 01:00:35,285
is the barrel of a Smith and Wesson
.357 Combat Magnum.

639
01:00:35,367 --> 01:00:38,564
This weapon can fell an elephant
at a 100 yards...

640
01:00:38,647 --> 01:00:42,435
let alone a snake like you at point blank.

641
01:00:57,127 --> 01:00:59,960
My shoes, you see? My shoes.

642
01:01:01,287 --> 01:01:03,676
There's no one in them. Not even me.

643
01:01:06,207 --> 01:01:09,005
Sorry. May I just have a word?

644
01:01:10,327 --> 01:01:12,522
Just one second.

645
01:01:16,487 --> 01:01:17,806
This is a book.

646
01:01:18,887 --> 01:01:23,403
Rebecca Ryan is a character in a book.
A book is not real life.

647
01:01:23,687 --> 01:01:26,759
- Rebecca Ryan is not real life.
- Calm down.

648
01:01:26,847 --> 01:01:30,442
We all get a little tense
when the bullets start flying.

649
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:35,605
Are you listening to me? This is a book.

650
01:01:35,847 --> 01:01:38,680
Rebecca Ryan is a character in a book.

651
01:01:38,767 --> 01:01:42,442
There is no one behind the curtain,
there are no flying bullets.

652
01:01:53,327 --> 01:01:54,999
- Oh, my God.
- What?

653
01:01:55,727 --> 01:01:57,763
Someone really is trying to kill us.

654
01:01:57,847 --> 01:02:00,486
Dimitri, someone is always
trying to kill us.

655
01:02:00,807 --> 01:02:02,399
- We've got to get out of here.
- Right.

656
01:02:40,207 --> 01:02:41,162
Taxi.

657
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:55,839
- Hello.
- What a pleasant surprise.

658
01:02:55,927 --> 01:02:57,406
Aunt Edna.

659
01:02:58,647 --> 01:03:01,684
- Thank God you're here.
- Thank God you're here, too, dear.

660
01:03:01,767 --> 01:03:04,281
Now don't be upset.
Nobody's trying to kill us.

661
01:03:04,367 --> 01:03:06,676
We're just going to stay here
for a few days.

662
01:03:06,767 --> 01:03:08,997
- God, I need a drink.
- In there.

663
01:03:10,527 --> 01:03:11,960
New friend?

664
01:03:14,447 --> 01:03:16,324
She thinks she's Rebecca Ryan.

665
01:03:17,007 --> 01:03:18,520
She thinks I'm Dimitri.

666
01:03:18,607 --> 01:03:21,963
She obviously thinks
that you are Dimitri's Aunt Edna.

667
01:03:22,047 --> 01:03:24,641
- How utterly charming.
- Yeah.

668
01:03:25,167 --> 01:03:27,727
She also thinks
that someone is trying to kill us.

669
01:03:27,807 --> 01:03:30,765
Now, don't believe a word she says.

670
01:03:30,847 --> 01:03:34,806
Above all, don't let her set foot
outside this house. All right?

671
01:03:35,287 --> 01:03:36,766
Where are you going?

672
01:03:37,247 --> 01:03:38,316
To the police.

673
01:03:38,407 --> 01:03:40,363
Whatever for?

674
01:03:40,447 --> 01:03:42,244
Someone is trying to kill us.

675
01:03:43,407 --> 01:03:45,637
Whatever you say, dear.

676
01:03:49,007 --> 01:03:52,522
So, I understand
you're in a bit of a bind.

677
01:03:54,607 --> 01:03:57,679
What are you trying to tell me?

678
01:03:58,047 --> 01:04:02,404
Is she Rebecca Ryan
or is she not Rebecca Ryan?

679
01:04:02,487 --> 01:04:05,320
I told you, there is no such person.

680
01:04:05,407 --> 01:04:06,840
But she sat right here.

681
01:04:06,927 --> 01:04:09,487
No, she thinks
she's a character in a book.

682
01:04:09,567 --> 01:04:11,159
She thinks I'm a character in a book.

683
01:04:11,247 --> 01:04:13,966
She thinks even my mother
is a character in a book.

684
01:04:14,047 --> 01:04:18,040
- The woman is crazy.
- She is not the only one.

685
01:04:18,127 --> 01:04:20,516
Look, you have got to do something...

686
01:04:20,647 --> 01:04:23,525
because the priest's death
was not an accident.

687
01:04:23,687 --> 01:04:28,203
That bullet and this one
were meant for Rebecca.

688
01:04:28,487 --> 01:04:30,443
The woman who does not exist?

689
01:04:30,607 --> 01:04:35,397
No, of course she exists,
but not as Rebecca.

690
01:04:36,207 --> 01:04:39,643
- Because Rebecca does not exist.
- Right.

691
01:04:39,727 --> 01:04:43,083
Wrong. Get out of my office.

692
01:04:43,767 --> 01:04:46,235
If you could just take it
maybe from the beginning...

693
01:04:50,367 --> 01:04:53,325
- Aunt Edna?
- Yes, dear. I'm right here.

694
01:04:53,527 --> 01:04:57,486
They think I know who the killer is.
That's why they're trying to kill me.

695
01:04:58,167 --> 01:05:01,477
- It's so obvious.
- I wouldn't say obvious.

696
01:05:01,567 --> 01:05:05,196
Sure it is. The Spanish Ambassador
tried to run me down.

697
01:05:05,287 --> 01:05:07,721
But he's just a pawn
in somebody else's game.

698
01:05:08,047 --> 01:05:12,086
The priest was the link, but they shot
him before he could finger the killer.

699
01:05:12,567 --> 01:05:15,843
Yes, I remember that story.

700
01:05:16,527 --> 01:05:20,725
It's the one where the Count,
whom we think is the good guy...

701
01:05:21,207 --> 01:05:23,402
- actually betrays...
- Victor.

702
01:05:23,887 --> 01:05:24,842
Who?

703
01:05:25,007 --> 01:05:29,000
My God, Edna, of course.
Count Reneleau. He's the killer.

704
01:05:29,687 --> 01:05:31,598
I've got to warn Victor.

705
01:05:32,687 --> 01:05:34,484
Oh, my.

706
01:05:57,167 --> 01:05:58,282
Victor.

707
01:06:00,207 --> 01:06:02,562
Thank you so much for meeting me.

708
01:06:05,487 --> 01:06:08,320
Ever since you spoke to me
at the Embassy party...

709
01:06:08,607 --> 01:06:11,724
I've been hoping I might see you again.

710
01:06:14,927 --> 01:06:15,996
- Victor, l...
- Yes?

711
01:06:16,087 --> 01:06:17,918
I know what you're thinking.

712
01:06:18,007 --> 01:06:21,317
You want to run your trembling fingers
through my hair.

713
01:06:22,927 --> 01:06:26,317
You want to carry me off somewhere
and make passionate love to me.

714
01:06:26,767 --> 01:06:28,485
But that will have to wait.

715
01:06:29,887 --> 01:06:33,960
I don't believe I have ever met a woman
quite like you before.

716
01:06:34,047 --> 01:06:35,366
I know.

717
01:06:37,047 --> 01:06:40,835
Believe me, Victor,
I know what you're going through.

718
01:06:43,447 --> 01:06:45,802
But we can't be blinded by passion.

719
01:06:46,447 --> 01:06:50,042
Not while your life is at stake.
I want you to tell me everything.

720
01:06:50,687 --> 01:06:54,282
Otherwise, I can't be responsible
for what might happen.

721
01:06:57,967 --> 01:06:59,639
Pleasure before business.

722
01:07:00,087 --> 01:07:04,046
Why don't we drink to me,
a victim of desire?

723
01:07:13,967 --> 01:07:15,082
Salud.

724
01:07:20,047 --> 01:07:23,005
I told you not to let her out of the house.

725
01:07:23,087 --> 01:07:24,679
I didn't. She let herself out.

726
01:07:25,407 --> 01:07:28,046
She's a headstrong young lady
and I found that attractive.

727
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,925
- Mother, what did you say to her?
- I didn't say anything.

728
01:07:31,007 --> 01:07:34,238
- You encouraged her, didn't you?
- No, I didn't encourage her.

729
01:07:34,767 --> 01:07:36,758
- I just set her straight.
- Mother.

730
01:07:37,207 --> 01:07:39,562
She was recounting the plot of
The Priest Confesses...

731
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:41,478
but she seemed to have it all mixed up.

732
01:07:41,567 --> 01:07:44,843
I simply reminded her that
in The Priest Confesses, the Count...

733
01:07:44,927 --> 01:07:47,964
whom we all think is the good guy,
actually betrays...

734
01:07:48,047 --> 01:07:49,002
Victor.

735
01:07:49,207 --> 01:07:50,640
That's what she said.

736
01:07:50,727 --> 01:07:53,525
Mother, what have you done?

737
01:07:53,967 --> 01:07:57,357
I don't remember this Victor chap
in The Priest Confesses.

738
01:07:57,487 --> 01:07:59,478
He's not in The Priest Confesses.

739
01:07:59,887 --> 01:08:01,525
Was it The Poisoned Princess?

740
01:08:01,607 --> 01:08:03,916
No, he's not in a book. He's real.

741
01:08:04,007 --> 01:08:06,316
Darling, I know we like to think of them
as real...

742
01:08:06,407 --> 01:08:08,477
but they are only characters in a book.

743
01:08:08,567 --> 01:08:11,923
She obviously thinks
that Victor is Vincent. Here it is.

744
01:08:12,367 --> 01:08:14,835
"Rebecca gave Vincent's secretary
urgent instructions:

745
01:08:14,927 --> 01:08:16,519
"'Meet me at Chez Bernard immediately.

746
01:08:16,607 --> 01:08:19,599
"'Your future and that of your country
hang in the balance."'

747
01:08:19,727 --> 01:08:22,639
I will not be outwitted
by a two-dimensional character...

748
01:08:22,727 --> 01:08:25,002
in a cheap romantic thriller.

749
01:08:25,967 --> 01:08:27,764
Bite your tongue.

750
01:08:35,247 --> 01:08:36,441
Oh, my God.

751
01:08:39,567 --> 01:08:41,398
Excuse me, sir.

752
01:08:45,167 --> 01:08:47,317
Victor. Is he all right?

753
01:08:47,407 --> 01:08:50,365
- Yes, sir.
- What happened? Was there a girl?

754
01:08:50,487 --> 01:08:52,125
Excuse me.

755
01:08:56,287 --> 01:08:58,357
Rebecca. Are you all right?

756
01:08:58,447 --> 01:09:01,120
I'm fine, Dimitri.
Unfortunately, Victor wasn't so lucky.

757
01:09:01,207 --> 01:09:03,163
God, what happened?

758
01:09:04,327 --> 01:09:06,887
If it wasn't for Miss Ryan's knowledge
of first aid...

759
01:09:06,967 --> 01:09:09,083
he would be in the morgue right now.

760
01:09:09,207 --> 01:09:10,560
Just doing my job.

761
01:09:11,607 --> 01:09:14,246
We found traces of potassium cyanide.

762
01:09:15,007 --> 01:09:16,520
- Cyanide?
- Yes.

763
01:09:16,607 --> 01:09:19,758
But as I remember it
he was supposed to have his throat cut.

764
01:09:26,887 --> 01:09:29,924
They caught me off guard.
I didn't expect them to poison him.

765
01:09:30,007 --> 01:09:32,316
- But look.
- What is that?

766
01:09:32,407 --> 01:09:34,875
It's the matchbook from the park.

767
01:09:34,967 --> 01:09:37,276
- Where did you get that?
- It was in his pocket.

768
01:09:38,367 --> 01:09:43,077
"640 St. Raphaël 12."
What do you think that means?

769
01:09:44,927 --> 01:09:46,246
It's an address.

770
01:09:47,087 --> 01:09:49,043
- It must be an address.
- Exactly.

771
01:09:49,607 --> 01:09:50,881
Taxi.

772
01:09:51,167 --> 01:09:52,600
Why am I saying this?

773
01:09:55,367 --> 01:09:58,404
Well done, Dimitri.
Now, what about the 12?

774
01:10:01,847 --> 01:10:04,964
Maybe we missed him.
Maybe it's just as well.

775
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:07,523
Might have been
a lot of innocent bloodshed...

776
01:10:07,607 --> 01:10:09,086
if he'd had the nerve to show up.

777
01:10:09,167 --> 01:10:11,283
- Who?
- Count Reneleau.

778
01:10:13,607 --> 01:10:16,360
Can't we just forget this character
for a while?

779
01:10:16,807 --> 01:10:19,367
I've been trying to forget Reneleau
for years.

780
01:10:19,447 --> 01:10:21,597
You might as well try and forget evil.

781
01:10:22,407 --> 01:10:26,286
He thinks I'm stupid and inept.
He doesn't even know me.

782
01:10:27,087 --> 01:10:28,486
It makes me so mad...

783
01:10:28,567 --> 01:10:31,639
when he ignores me
for his accounts at 2:00 in the morning.

784
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:34,400
He ignores you for his accounts?
What do you mean?

785
01:10:35,247 --> 01:10:36,236
What?

786
01:10:36,327 --> 01:10:39,683
You said he ignores you
for his accounts.

787
01:10:39,767 --> 01:10:42,964
No. He's a Count. Count Reneleau.

788
01:10:45,087 --> 01:10:47,521
I don't think
I can take much more of this.

789
01:10:47,607 --> 01:10:50,917
People are shooting at us with guns
and everything, and I don't know why.

790
01:10:52,647 --> 01:10:56,686
I don't know what's real anymore.
I don't even know if you're real.

791
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:03,679
I don't know what it is you've got,
but I think it's contagious.

792
01:11:04,727 --> 01:11:05,955
Do you want to?

793
01:11:06,887 --> 01:11:08,286
If you want to.

794
01:11:08,967 --> 01:11:12,004
- Only if you do.
- Well, sure, I want to.

795
01:11:12,327 --> 01:11:15,478
- You don't sound very sure.
- Sure I'm sure.

796
01:11:15,647 --> 01:11:19,276
It's just if you've seen one cathedral,
you've seen them all.

797
01:11:19,767 --> 01:11:24,522
- Okay, Harold.
- It's only a stupid cathedral.

798
01:11:26,807 --> 01:11:31,517
It's not the cathedral, Harold.
It's the last 15 years.

799
01:11:56,207 --> 01:11:57,401
What's wrong?

800
01:12:04,367 --> 01:12:06,562
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

801
01:12:07,847 --> 01:12:10,805
Really. Everything's going to be all right.

802
01:12:13,447 --> 01:12:15,836
I won't let anything happen to you.

803
01:12:17,527 --> 01:12:20,564
I'll stay with you till you're through this.

804
01:12:24,127 --> 01:12:26,243
If anything does happen to you...

805
01:12:27,527 --> 01:12:29,722
it'll probably happen to me as well.

806
01:12:36,287 --> 01:12:37,606
Now, let's eat.

807
01:12:51,527 --> 01:12:52,926
Oh, my God.

808
01:13:09,127 --> 01:13:10,446
I've got it.

809
01:13:11,367 --> 01:13:13,483
- I've got it.
- Got what?

810
01:13:13,687 --> 01:13:17,760
Count Reneleau wasn't trying
to kill Victor, he was trying to kill me.

811
01:13:19,527 --> 01:13:22,599
- What's wrong?
- God. You're so beautiful.

812
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:25,599
I know, but that's beside the point.
Aren't you listening to me?

813
01:13:25,687 --> 01:13:28,485
- No, I think you better leave.
- Why?

814
01:13:48,207 --> 01:13:50,880
- Sorry.
- I'm not.

815
01:13:59,247 --> 01:14:01,602
I've waited for this moment for 15 years.

816
01:14:02,647 --> 01:14:04,239
I wish that were true.

817
01:14:05,167 --> 01:14:06,805
I wish it were all true.

818
01:14:07,567 --> 01:14:10,286
I've loved you ever since the first time
I set eyes on you.

819
01:14:10,367 --> 01:14:11,516
Really?

820
01:14:18,247 --> 01:14:21,956
Ever since we met on that train
to Istanbul so many years ago.

821
01:14:26,247 --> 01:14:27,202
Rebecca.

822
01:14:30,727 --> 01:14:32,763
There's something we have to face.

823
01:14:34,247 --> 01:14:36,636
I know. I think we made a mistake.

824
01:14:39,887 --> 01:14:41,081
I don't know.

825
01:14:42,287 --> 01:14:44,676
That's my fault, it's not yours.

826
01:14:45,327 --> 01:14:47,522
It's no one's fault. It just happened.

827
01:14:47,607 --> 01:14:50,804
- We must have misread it.
- Misread it?

828
01:14:52,167 --> 01:14:55,045
Yeah, the address.
It didn't lead us anywhere.

829
01:14:59,527 --> 01:15:03,122
- Do you think it could be a red herring?
- I'm afraid to think anymore.

830
01:15:48,647 --> 01:15:50,524
My son also rises.

831
01:15:52,847 --> 01:15:55,645
Too bad you weren't up earlier
to help me in the garden.

832
01:16:00,207 --> 01:16:02,926
My chrysanthemums
are lovely this year.

833
01:16:07,527 --> 01:16:10,678
- I think I'm in love with her.
- Isn't that nice?

834
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:13,956
You don't understand. She's a nut.

835
01:16:15,047 --> 01:16:17,959
Your father was one of the biggest nuts
of the whole world...

836
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:20,515
and I loved him dearly for 33 years.

837
01:16:21,847 --> 01:16:25,078
Even when he chained himself to a tree
during an electrical storm...

838
01:16:25,167 --> 01:16:27,442
and dared the lightning to strike him.

839
01:16:28,687 --> 01:16:31,326
Which, unfortunately, it did.

840
01:16:33,207 --> 01:16:35,402
I should have taken her to a hospital.

841
01:16:36,607 --> 01:16:38,996
Why is she starting to make sense?

842
01:16:41,127 --> 01:16:43,687
Why am I asking you?

843
01:16:46,247 --> 01:16:47,362
I'll get it.

844
01:16:53,087 --> 01:16:54,202
- Yes?
- You...

845
01:17:09,607 --> 01:17:12,246
Now, stop it. Both of you. Right now.

846
01:17:21,527 --> 01:17:25,998
Dimitri, it's not an address.
It wasn't an address at all.

847
01:17:26,287 --> 01:17:28,847
It's a departure time
for the Paris Express. Look.

848
01:17:28,927 --> 01:17:32,476
The 6:40 to St. Raphaël on the 12th.
That's today.

849
01:17:32,567 --> 01:17:36,355
Victor will be on that train. And
it will be the last train he ever takes.

850
01:17:37,727 --> 01:17:40,878
- What happened to your nose?
- My nose?

851
01:17:45,607 --> 01:17:47,916
Someone just tried to kill me.

852
01:17:48,007 --> 01:17:51,477
They will stop at nothing to keep us
from getting on that train. Come on.

853
01:17:51,567 --> 01:17:53,876
There's not a moment to lose.
Coming, Aunt Edna?

854
01:17:53,967 --> 01:17:55,446
Yes. Of course.

855
01:17:55,567 --> 01:17:56,522
Hat.

856
01:18:04,207 --> 01:18:05,401
Cathy?

857
01:18:37,007 --> 01:18:39,202
Victor's going to deliver
the state secrets.

858
01:18:39,287 --> 01:18:42,120
Once they're in Count Reneleau's
hands, he's as good as dead.

859
01:18:42,447 --> 01:18:44,642
Train leaves in 5 minutes,
can we make it?

860
01:18:44,727 --> 01:18:46,445
Watch this.

861
01:19:23,327 --> 01:19:24,282
Wait.

862
01:19:25,167 --> 01:19:26,122
Attendez.

863
01:20:00,487 --> 01:20:03,559
Wait. I'm here to help.

864
01:20:22,007 --> 01:20:22,962
Wait!

865
01:20:25,247 --> 01:20:27,078
Don't go in there. They'll kill you.

866
01:20:40,647 --> 01:20:43,605
Victor's safe now, thanks to us.

867
01:20:44,287 --> 01:20:46,084
Unfortunately, nobody else is.

868
01:20:46,167 --> 01:20:49,364
Not as long as Count Reneleau
is still alive.

869
01:20:58,647 --> 01:21:01,480
Dimitri, you know I always get my man.

870
01:21:01,567 --> 01:21:03,125
Even when he's a woman.

871
01:21:05,247 --> 01:21:07,886
- Even when he's a woman.
- My God.

872
01:21:09,567 --> 01:21:11,797
- Stop.
- What are you doing?

873
01:21:11,887 --> 01:21:12,797
Let go of me!

874
01:21:14,287 --> 01:21:17,643
Count Reneleau. He's a killer.
Don't let him near me.

875
01:21:18,047 --> 01:21:19,162
Cathy!

876
01:21:29,527 --> 01:21:31,324
Rebecca? What is it?

877
01:21:33,847 --> 01:21:34,882
Help me.

878
01:21:57,167 --> 01:22:01,445
One in a hundred, no, one in a million
is the talent your wife has.

879
01:22:02,327 --> 01:22:04,283
The girl can write.

880
01:22:04,767 --> 01:22:07,804
Let her do one book for me
and I guarantee a bestseller.

881
01:22:07,887 --> 01:22:09,843
Alan, you tell him.

882
01:22:10,807 --> 01:22:12,240
She's very talented.

883
01:22:17,967 --> 01:22:19,036
Well, I tried.

884
01:22:27,167 --> 01:22:28,441
Mr. Palmer?

885
01:22:30,567 --> 01:22:35,277
Your wife wants you to wait a moment
while she talks to Mr. McMann.

886
01:23:00,407 --> 01:23:03,160
- How are you?
- Okay.

887
01:23:06,207 --> 01:23:08,163
Quite a mystery I had going there,
wasn't it?

888
01:23:08,247 --> 01:23:09,999
Yes. Quite a fantasy.

889
01:23:10,327 --> 01:23:13,922
It's just unfortunate that it got mixed up
in other people's reality.

890
01:23:14,487 --> 01:23:16,443
I feel so bad about Victor.

891
01:23:17,127 --> 01:23:19,322
I tried to contact him several times...

892
01:23:20,007 --> 01:23:21,963
but he wouldn't return my calls.

893
01:23:23,967 --> 01:23:26,845
Thought I was saving his life.
I almost killed him.

894
01:23:27,127 --> 01:23:29,482
You were a heroine
in the classic tradition.

895
01:23:31,007 --> 01:23:33,646
It's strange
just being Cathy Palmer again.

896
01:23:35,567 --> 01:23:37,080
What's Cathy Palmer like?

897
01:23:39,327 --> 01:23:40,726
Nothing special.

898
01:23:42,967 --> 01:23:45,401
I bet you're glad to get rid of me.

899
01:23:48,087 --> 01:23:50,885
Actually, I've never been less glad
of anything in my life.

900
01:23:54,567 --> 01:23:55,636
Oh, well.

901
01:23:59,967 --> 01:24:01,958
I don't know how to say goodbye.

902
01:24:12,407 --> 01:24:14,125
Bye, Rebecca.

903
01:24:32,767 --> 01:24:34,723
Look, it's gonna be all right.

904
01:24:34,807 --> 01:24:37,401
We'll go home,
we'll pick up where we left off.

905
01:24:37,567 --> 01:24:41,355
A lot of things have happened, but
we'll just put those things behind us...

906
01:24:41,447 --> 01:24:42,846
and get on with...

907
01:24:46,527 --> 01:24:48,006
Things will be a lot clearer later.

908
01:24:48,087 --> 01:24:50,920
Maybe I didn't take this writing thing
of yours serious enough.

909
01:24:51,007 --> 01:24:52,884
Maybe some of this is my fault.

910
01:24:53,087 --> 01:24:55,601
But things can be like they were.
Or pretty close.

911
01:24:56,007 --> 01:24:58,646
No, they can't. What am I saying?

912
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:01,999
You've been running around Paris
as this weird person.

913
01:25:02,727 --> 01:25:04,126
You slept with...

914
01:25:05,327 --> 01:25:07,557
I think it's a mistake
to talk about this tonight.

915
01:25:07,647 --> 01:25:09,524
Things will be a lot clearer
in the morning.

916
01:25:09,607 --> 01:25:12,644
I'm looking forward to getting back.
God, it's gonna be good.

917
01:25:12,727 --> 01:25:14,479
Much better than it was before.

918
01:25:14,567 --> 01:25:16,797
Not that it was horrible or anything...

919
01:25:17,607 --> 01:25:20,963
but I'm aware that maybe
I haven't been the most...

920
01:25:21,607 --> 01:25:22,960
The best...

921
01:25:23,727 --> 01:25:26,241
Well, I am aware of those things.

922
01:25:26,327 --> 01:25:31,117
Still, it's a good thing. I mean
you and I have a pretty good thing.

923
01:25:33,207 --> 01:25:35,596
Marriage isn't always
just smooth sailing.

924
01:25:35,887 --> 01:25:39,926
I mean, marriage is a tough proposition
in any country.

925
01:25:40,487 --> 01:25:44,844
Just do me one favour, kid.
Don't enter any more contests.

926
01:25:50,967 --> 01:25:52,400
We're together.

927
01:26:07,047 --> 01:26:09,436
- I can't.
- You can't what?

928
01:26:10,327 --> 01:26:11,760
I can't make it work.

929
01:26:12,087 --> 01:26:15,443
Cathy, I've taken about all of this
I'm going to take.

930
01:26:15,927 --> 01:26:17,565
I've given all I can give.

931
01:26:18,887 --> 01:26:20,718
This is ridiculous.

932
01:26:21,567 --> 01:26:24,923
You're going to end our marriage
right here in an airport?

933
01:26:47,607 --> 01:26:48,562
Alan.

934
01:27:13,487 --> 01:27:16,718
I couldn't go back to what I was.
I tried, but I just...

935
01:27:53,527 --> 01:27:56,758
We gotta get out of here.
My head is killing me.

936
01:27:56,847 --> 01:27:59,236
If I can think of a way...

937
01:28:16,127 --> 01:28:17,765
Victor, what are you doing here?

938
01:28:18,407 --> 01:28:21,205
Don't you think
it's a little late to play innocent?

939
01:28:21,687 --> 01:28:24,520
You're behind this?
What did we ever do to you?

940
01:28:27,567 --> 01:28:28,886
I love this room.

941
01:28:30,127 --> 01:28:34,200
My ancestors strangled, massacred,
and hanged...

942
01:28:34,287 --> 01:28:38,166
several hundred Protestants in here
during the 16th century...

943
01:28:38,247 --> 01:28:41,205
a glorious era
that shall never come again.

944
01:28:41,807 --> 01:28:46,483
Do you have any idea how much it costs
to maintain a place like this?

945
01:28:48,647 --> 01:28:51,320
For a couple of centuries
it was tea and opium.

946
01:28:52,407 --> 01:28:54,841
Nowadays it's cocaine and heroin.

947
01:28:55,727 --> 01:28:58,560
My God. You shot the priest.

948
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:00,919
I was aiming for Miss Ryan.

949
01:29:01,367 --> 01:29:04,245
Shooting a priest
distressed me enormously.

950
01:29:05,207 --> 01:29:08,483
I don't know how much you know
about my activities, Miss Ryan...

951
01:29:08,567 --> 01:29:09,761
but I intend to find out.

952
01:29:09,847 --> 01:29:12,236
You've got it wrong.
I'm not Rebecca Ryan.

953
01:29:13,007 --> 01:29:17,239
In about 20 minutes,
you'll be begging to tell me everything.

954
01:29:18,447 --> 01:29:22,326
Even as we speak, the blood
is gorging the capillaries of your brains.

955
01:29:22,527 --> 01:29:24,882
Soon, some of them
will begin to explode.

956
01:29:25,207 --> 01:29:28,563
I'd be more than happy to provide
a less painful death...

957
01:29:28,847 --> 01:29:32,886
if you'd just tell me
who it was that betrayed me.

958
01:29:37,167 --> 01:29:39,965
Victor, you don't understand.
We don't know anything.

959
01:29:40,047 --> 01:29:43,437
She suffered a traumatic shock. She
thought she was a character in a book.

960
01:29:43,527 --> 01:29:45,802
Didn't you ever hear of
the Rebecca Ryan novels?

961
01:29:45,887 --> 01:29:47,605
The time for games is over.

962
01:29:48,407 --> 01:29:51,763
You've been remarkably successful
in avoiding your death...

963
01:29:52,407 --> 01:29:53,522
until now.

964
01:29:59,327 --> 01:30:01,397
Wait. Victor, don't go.

965
01:30:04,527 --> 01:30:05,596
What are you doing?

966
01:30:05,687 --> 01:30:08,759
I'm doing what Rebecca Ryan did in
The Missionary Murders.

967
01:30:08,927 --> 01:30:11,600
She swung back and forth
until she caught Dimitri's hands...

968
01:30:11,687 --> 01:30:13,040
and then she untied him.

969
01:30:13,127 --> 01:30:16,676
That wasn't The Missionary Murders,
that was The Stairway to Death.

970
01:30:16,767 --> 01:30:20,237
No, that wasn't The Stairway to Death.
In The Stairway to Death...

971
01:30:20,327 --> 01:30:23,046
she made the bomb out of
the Sheikh's aftershave.

972
01:30:23,167 --> 01:30:25,806
No, that was The Serpent Sings.

973
01:30:25,887 --> 01:30:29,323
You're crazy.
It wasn't The Serpent Sings.

974
01:30:29,407 --> 01:30:32,604
Of course it was.
The stupid serpent bloody sings.

975
01:30:32,727 --> 01:30:36,083
You've got it. It's loose.

976
01:30:36,687 --> 01:30:39,406
Christ, anyway. I ought to know...

977
01:30:41,047 --> 01:30:42,002
as...

978
01:30:43,047 --> 01:30:44,241
I...

979
01:30:44,927 --> 01:30:46,326
wrote...

980
01:30:47,167 --> 01:30:48,805
the bloody...

981
01:30:49,687 --> 01:30:50,642
books.

982
01:30:51,607 --> 01:30:52,562
What?

983
01:30:54,687 --> 01:30:56,882
What do you mean,
you wrote the books?

984
01:30:57,327 --> 01:30:59,761
I'm Margaret McMann.

985
01:30:59,847 --> 01:31:00,836
What?

986
01:31:05,167 --> 01:31:06,885
I mean, she's my mother.

987
01:31:07,047 --> 01:31:09,845
- She's your...
- And I'm her son.

988
01:31:09,927 --> 01:31:12,316
But she didn't write the books, I did.

989
01:31:12,407 --> 01:31:13,806
She's my front.

990
01:31:20,887 --> 01:31:22,957
What do you mean, she's your front?

991
01:31:23,687 --> 01:31:25,643
I didn't want anybody to know...

992
01:31:25,807 --> 01:31:27,604
that I wrote that cheap pulp.

993
01:31:27,767 --> 01:31:30,565
Cheap pulp?
How dare you call that cheap pulp?

994
01:31:30,647 --> 01:31:34,003
Those are wonderful stories,
and you're a terrific writer.

995
01:31:35,647 --> 01:31:38,115
- You really think so?
- I love those books.

996
01:31:38,727 --> 01:31:41,480
That's what got me into all this trouble
in the first place.

997
01:31:43,807 --> 01:31:44,876
Let's get out of here.

998
01:31:47,447 --> 01:31:49,278
God. I hate heights.

999
01:31:49,367 --> 01:31:50,720
Give me your hand.

1000
01:32:04,647 --> 01:32:06,000
Wait.

1001
01:32:31,287 --> 01:32:32,242
Come on!

1002
01:32:45,407 --> 01:32:48,080
Alan, I think we're in trouble.

1003
01:33:45,487 --> 01:33:47,443
You two are impossible.

1004
01:33:51,247 --> 01:33:52,202
Au revoir.

1005
01:33:57,167 --> 01:33:58,361
Look out!

1006
01:34:03,567 --> 01:34:04,716
Oh, my God.

1007
01:34:13,687 --> 01:34:15,405
What do we do now, Rebecca?

1008
01:34:15,967 --> 01:34:17,605
I wish I knew.

1009
01:34:18,127 --> 01:34:19,879
I can't hold on much longer.

1010
01:34:20,687 --> 01:34:21,881
Neither can I.

1011
01:34:23,887 --> 01:34:26,276
I know this isn't
the right time or place, but...

1012
01:34:26,847 --> 01:34:27,916
I love you.

1013
01:34:31,607 --> 01:34:33,120
I love you, too.

1014
01:34:55,607 --> 01:34:56,881
"...narrowly missing them...

1015
01:34:56,967 --> 01:35:00,118
"and sending the planks crashing
down onto the jagged rocks below.

1016
01:35:00,207 --> 01:35:02,357
"Instinctively,
they leaped for the scaffolding...

1017
01:35:02,447 --> 01:35:06,281
"which, to their horror,
swung inexorably out over the water...

1018
01:35:06,367 --> 01:35:09,279
"leaving them helplessly suspended
in midair.

1019
01:35:10,687 --> 01:35:12,678
"Their eyes met in desperation...

1020
01:35:12,767 --> 01:35:17,079
"as their fingers slowly slipped
from the cold steel.

1021
01:35:17,527 --> 01:35:20,883
"Down they plunged, 200 feet...

1022
01:35:20,967 --> 01:35:25,757
"and disappeared beneath
the dark surface of the icy water."

1023
01:35:32,407 --> 01:35:33,476
Time for bed.

1024
01:35:33,567 --> 01:35:36,445
You can't stop now.
I can't stand the suspense.

1025
01:35:36,767 --> 01:35:38,246
Neither can Margaret.

1026
01:35:41,767 --> 01:35:42,916
Come on, chaps.

1027
01:35:43,007 --> 01:35:45,282
Just a couple more pages.
Talk to her, Alan.

1028
01:35:45,367 --> 01:35:46,641
There are no more pages.

1029
01:35:46,727 --> 01:35:48,718
- Hurry up and write some.
- To bed.

1030
01:35:54,247 --> 01:35:56,602
- Goodnight, Mum.
- Goodnight, sweetheart.

1031
01:36:00,647 --> 01:36:02,763
- Goodnight, Mum.
- Goodnight, Alan.

1032
01:36:03,167 --> 01:36:04,600
Sleep tight.

1033
01:36:06,047 --> 01:36:09,084
So they disappear beneath the surface
of the icy water.

1034
01:36:12,807 --> 01:36:14,320
What happens next?

1035
01:36:15,167 --> 01:36:16,919
You know what happened next.

1036
01:36:17,247 --> 01:36:19,238
Yes, but we can't tell them that.

1037
01:36:33,887 --> 01:36:35,366
Okay, so?

1038
01:36:38,047 --> 01:36:39,400
Well, how about...

1039
01:36:40,647 --> 01:36:42,478
she gets eaten by a giant...

1040
01:36:44,527 --> 01:36:47,564
- She gets eaten by a giant.
- Alan.

1041
01:36:50,407 --> 01:36:51,362
All right.

1042
01:36:52,647 --> 01:36:53,841
How about...

1043
01:36:55,367 --> 01:36:57,722
he doesn't want to work
any more tonight...

1044
01:36:58,767 --> 01:37:00,803
so he carries her off...

1045
01:37:01,447 --> 01:37:05,201
to a turret high in his castle...

1046
01:37:06,807 --> 01:37:11,244
runs his fingers through her silky hair...

1047
01:37:13,687 --> 01:37:17,157
and makes mad, passionate...

1048
01:37:17,767 --> 01:37:19,405
love to her.

1049
01:37:30,967 --> 01:37:32,605
End of chapter.
