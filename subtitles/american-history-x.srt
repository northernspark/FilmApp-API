2
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,996
Derek.

3
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,623
Derek.

4
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:13,001
Fucking pervert, Dan.
- Jesus, what the fuck are you thinking?

5
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:16,004
There's a black guy outside.
He's breaking into your car.

6
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,800
How long's he been there?
- I don't know.

7
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,344
What's going on?
- Not right now, honey. How many?

8
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,181
- Danny, how many?
- One, I think.

9
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,267
Is he strapped?

10
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,436
- Does he have a fucking gun, Danny?
- Man, I don't fucking know.

11
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,524
Wait a second.
What the fuck is going on, Derek?

12
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,442
- Stay right here and be quiet.
- Jesus.

13
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,362
- Stay right here.
Wait a second, Derek. Wait.

14
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,989
Derek.

15
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,742
Shh, shh, shh.

16
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,411
They're right here.

17
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,639
I don't have a personal problem
with him, okay?

18
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,350
Don't insult my intelligence, Murray.

19
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,311
You hate this child
and I think I know why.

20
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,029
I went out with his mother a few times.

21
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,323
That was three years ago. It was nothing.

22
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,825
Nothing. Really? Hmm.

23
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:53,120
That paper, Bob, it's a travesty.

24
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:56,164
Arguing for Hitler as a civil-rights hero?

25
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,749
You've gotta draw the line.

26
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,001
Murray, you actually did this to yourself.

27
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,629
You told them they could
do a report on any book...

28
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:06,007
...that related to the struggle
for civil rights. In plain English.

29
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,847
I am not disputing the fact that the child
is confused and harbors some sick ideas...

30
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,641
...but I am not ready
to give up on him yet.

31
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,436
His brother probably put him up to it.

32
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,606
I can guarantee you 100 percent
his brother did not put him up to this.

33
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,109
I find that hard to believe. Whatever.

34
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:27,362
I know he was a good kid
and it's a shame what he's been through...

35
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,781
...but that is dangerous.
- Dangerous in what way?

36
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,617
Bob, that goes too far.

37
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:36,413
This racist propaganda,
this Mein Kampf psychobabble?

38
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,499
He learned this nonsense, Murray,
and he can unlearn it too.

39
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,335
I will not give up on this child yet.

40
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,023
- I knew it was you.
Danny, get in here.

41
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:07,235
I said, get in here. Get in here!

42
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,029
Five, four, three...

43
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,990
...two... Shut the door.

44
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,703
What's it gonna be, Danny?

45
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,164
What's what gonna be?

46
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,750
This petty crap you're pulling.

47
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:24,753
I don't know.

48
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,463
Have a seat.

49
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,554
How you doing?

50
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,183
Fine.

51
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,602
Things at home okay?

52
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,979
Yeah.

53
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,276
Derek got out this morning, did he not?

54
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,280
Yeah, he did.

55
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,784
He was one of my students.
You knew that, right?

56
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,621
Honors English.
He was a brilliant student.

57
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:03,959
Like you. But he hung out
with simple-minded fools.

58
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,294
- Heh-heh-heh.
- Also like you.

59
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,922
Look, did you bring me in here
to talk about Derek?

60
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,299
Because what happened to him
has nothing to do with me.

61
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,970
Everything you do right now
has something to do with Derek.

62
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,722
Look, I followed directions
and I wrote an A paper.

63
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,976
"Mein Kampf"?

64
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,479
- I should expel you.
- Go ahead.

65
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:28,650
- You don't think I could handle it?
- No, I think the street would kill you.

66
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:32,487
Your rhetoric and your propaganda
aren't gonna save you out there.

67
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,907
So here's the drill.

68
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,618
I'm your history teacher from now on.

69
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,330
We will discuss current events.

70
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,916
We will call this class...

71
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,837
...American History X.

72
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,840
We meet once a day.

73
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:56,678
All right, your first assignment is to
prepare for me a new paper due tomorrow.

74
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:00,473
Oh, come on. It took me a week
to read Mein Kampf. That isn't fair.

75
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,445
- What do you want me to do it on?
- Your brother.

76
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,865
Oh, God, man.
Please tell me you're joking.

77
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,200
No, no, no. I'm not kidding.

78
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:24,706
I want you to analyze and interpret all the
events surrounding Derek's incarceration.

79
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:28,501
How these events helped shape
your present perspective...

80
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:32,088
...concerning life
in contemporary America.

81
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,007
The impact on your life.

82
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,259
Your family's.

83
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,930
Whatever you wanna say, Danny...

84
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,394
...I'll be the only one reading it.

85
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,065
But if it's not on my desk...

86
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,025
...tomorrow morning...

87
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:56,071
...you are a ghost at Venice Beach High.

88
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,240
Are you clear?

89
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,202
Yeah, I'm clear.

90
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,250
Telling teacher I'm fucking cheating?

91
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,544
Is that what's happening?

92
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:14,839
- I never cheated in my life.
- Beat his motherfucking ass, Henry.

93
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,759
- I didn't say anything.
- Why you tripping on me?

94
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,764
Why you all kicking him like that?

95
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,599
What's up, man?

96
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,936
What you scared for?
I ain't gonna do nothing.

97
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,986
What's up?

98
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:41,282
Want some too, bitch?
Punk. What's wrong with you?

99
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,243
You wanna die?

100
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,538
Punk-ass white boy.

101
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:56,297
You lucky I gotta go to class.
He ain't gonna do nothing.

102
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:59,342
He don't wanna see me and the heater.

103
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,139
Lucky the bell rung.
I would have clocked that white boy.

104
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,765
Punk-ass motherfucker.

105
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:06,975
We'd smoke that fool.

106
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,478
You gotta fucking stand up for yourself.

107
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,204
We got a whole file on skinheads.

108
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:31,332
These all part of the same gang?
Venice Beach Gang.

109
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,918
Where's my buddy?
He's doing a stretch at YA.

110
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,421
This guy C.C.?
Mm-hm.

111
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,174
That him?
Yeah, that's him right there.

112
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:44,345
This morning we have a guest coming in,
and there he is.

113
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,556
- Morning.
- Morning, sir.

114
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,349
- Good to see you, pal.
- Morning.

115
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,643
Gentlemen, this here is Dr. Bob Sweeney.

116
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,188
He's principal over at Venice Beach High.

117
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:58,109
He's been doing outreach work with gangs,
both in and out of the can.

118
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,779
Three years ago,
a local kid named Derek Vinyard...

119
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:04,449
...was sent up for murdering two Crips
who were trying to jack his car.

120
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:09,037
Bob taught Vinyard back in high school
and he's followed the case closely.

121
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,831
He was a skinhead, right?

122
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:16,169
He was more like the skinhead.
The protégé of Cameron Alexander.

123
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:19,047
- Who?
- Cameron Alexander.

124
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,382
Here you go. Have a look-see.

125
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,718
Cameron Alexander, well...

126
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,470
...he's a Venice Beach landmark.

127
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:29,224
He's probably the biggest distributor
of white-power literature and videos...

128
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,475
...in L.A. County.

129
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,144
He promotes white-power bands.
He writes reviews.

130
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,231
And, uh, in his spare time
this guy even writes hate columns.

131
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,690
Does he have a record?

132
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,067
He's pretty clean.

133
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,861
Been trying to pin something to him,
but it doesn't work.

134
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,739
Trust me. He's behind all of it.

135
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,200
He runs everything out of his house
down by the beach.

136
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,410
No white gangs in Venice Beach...

137
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,913
...before Cameron Alexander
and Derek Vinyard hooked up.

138
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,083
Alexander found in Derek
his shining prince.

139
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:59,254
Essentially, he used Derek
to recruit a slew of insecure...

140
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,422
...frustrated and impressionable kids.

141
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,260
This kid Vinyard, well,
he's got a lot of baggage...

142
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:09,389
...as you'll see in this tape
that we've gotten courtesy of NBC.

143
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,023
L.A. County firefighter Dennis Vinyard...

144
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,694
...was shot and killed battling a blaze
at a suspected Compton drug den.

145
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,612
We're at the Vinyard home right now...

146
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,783
...and Lieutenant Vinyard's oldest son,
Derek, has agreed to talk with us.

147
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:32,745
Derek, if you could come down here,
please, for just a second.

148
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:36,791
Look, I know this is tough,
but, um, how do you feel right now?

149
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,460
How do you think I feel?

150
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,840
- I think it's typical.
- Typical, how?

151
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:47,719
This country's becoming a haven
for criminals, so, what do you expect?

152
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,138
Decent, hardworking Americans
like my dad...

153
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,391
...are getting rubbed out
by social parasites.

154
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,226
Parasites?

155
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,897
Blacks, browns, yellow, whatever.

156
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,189
I don't understand.

157
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,483
You're saying your father's murder
was race-related?

158
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,485
Yeah, it's race-related.

159
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:08,281
Every problem in this country
is race-related, not just crime.

160
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:12,201
Immigration, AIDS, welfare. Those are
problems of the black community...

161
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,330
...the Hispanic community,
Asian community. Not white problems.

162
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,498
Aren't those issues
that deal more with poverty?

163
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:21,586
No. They're not products of their
environments, either. That's crap.

164
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,963
Minorities don't give two shits
about this country.

165
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,549
They come here to exploit it,
not to embrace it.

166
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,969
Millions of white European-Americans
came here and flourished.

167
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:33,181
Within a generation. What the fuck
is the matter with these people?

168
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,934
They have to go around shooting at firemen.

169
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:41,230
- What does this have to do with your father?
- My father was murdered doing his job.

170
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,524
Putting out a fire
in a nigger neighborhood...

171
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,526
...he shouldn't have given
a shit about.

172
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:49,364
He got shot by a fucking drug dealer
who probably collects a welfare check.

173
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,324
- That's enough.
- I'm sorry.

174
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:54,369
Derek Vinyard was released
from Chino earlier this morning...

175
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,746
...after serving three and some-odd years.

176
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,457
I think this is something
we gotta keep an eye on.

177
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,417
If something happens to him...

178
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,045
...things could get very ugly
down by the beach.

179
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:05,463
Just keep it low.

180
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,884
Venice Beach didn't always look like this.

181
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,470
It used to be a great neighborhood.

182
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,472
The boardwalk's always been a dump...

183
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,516
...but when my dad moved us out here...

184
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,185
...Venice was a nice, quiet place
to grow up.

185
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,815
Over the years, though,
it's just gone to hell.

186
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,067
The gangs are like a plague.

187
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,945
They moved west from Inglewood
and South Central...

188
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,530
...and basically took over.

189
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,991
It ain't fouling you.
What's wrong with you?

190
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,495
Fuck all y'all.

191
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,582
I ain't got time for all the bullshit.

192
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,584
Fuck y'all.

193
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,045
You all right?
I'm all right.

194
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:50,299
Yo, is that that fool
you was telling me about?

195
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,927
Yeah, that's that motherfucker.

196
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,560
Yeah, man, that's him.

197
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,446
Bitch-ass motherfucker.

198
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,781
That's why Derek started the D.O.C.

199
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:18,286
He said white kids shouldn't have to walk
around scared in their own neighborhood.

200
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:22,373
For a while there, he really made it
like it was ours again.

201
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,959
- Throw the ball. Throw the ball.
- Come on, Seth. Block.

202
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:28,963
Come on, Curtis. Quit chucking it up.
Pass the ball.

203
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,466
- Pass that thing.
- D up.

204
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,634
- Here we go.
- Come on, let's go. Let's go.

205
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:34,844
Come on.

206
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:39,140
Look at this fucking jungle bunny.
He does a spin move every time. Every time.

207
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:44,103
- You ain't getting shit, motherfucker.
- Over here. Over here.

208
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,646
This one's for you, boy!

209
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,816
- Fuck you...?
- Stop that.

210
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,443
Who you calling a boy, motherfucker?

211
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:53,905
You lucky motherfucker! I'm through
monkeying around with your ass!

212
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,532
You pale, pastrami-eating,
cracker motherfucker...

213
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,659
...a hundred bucks say
I make you my bitch.

214
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:05,666
Hear that? He's trying to make ends meet
for his cut in welfare. You're fucking on!

215
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,838
- It's 8-6, Seth.
- When I want your opinion, I'll ask for it.

216
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:13,508
Come on, guys, I can't cover this.
Help me out here.

217
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:17,011
- You have a big fucking mouth, Seth.
- I can take this niglet down.

218
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,597
You can't take a shit.
The fuck are you thinking?

219
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,517
- I will beat him. Give me the money.
- Shut up. Shut up.

220
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,936
You're gonna fucking embarrass us.
Shut up!

221
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,445
I'll take care of this.

222
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,615
Hey.

223
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,035
I got a bet.

224
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:46,791
I come in this game right now. Same score,
but we play black guys against white guys.

225
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,044
Motherfucker.

226
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,130
Oh, shit.

227
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,173
Name your price, cracker.

228
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,509
No money. No money. For these courts.

229
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,469
And not just today. For good.

230
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:02,849
If you win, we will walk away.
But if we win...

231
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:05,143
...no bitching, no fighting...

232
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:09,230
...here in front of everybody, pack your shit
and get your black asses out of here.

233
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,315
Man, fuck that. Take this bet, man.

234
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,859
Eight to six, our ball.

235
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,987
Let's go.

236
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,253
Pick him up. Pick him up.

237
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,553
Seth, get back and play some D!

238
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,513
Come on, Seth.

239
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,434
Come on, let's go.

240
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,403
All right. Defense!

241
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,912
All right.

242
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,289
Pass the fucking ball, I was wide open.

243
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,502
Damn!

244
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,880
Let's go. Let's go, yo. Let's go.

245
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:17,715
Pick, pick, Derek!

246
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,056
Bullshit! That's offense.

247
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,434
- Get out of here. He moved his feet.
- If you want to go, I'm ready!

248
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,061
- Don't throw elbows!
- Want to go?

249
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,313
Adolf Hitler-wannabe motherfucker?
What?

250
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,816
Kill that motherfucker! Dead!

251
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,652
Chill out, bro. Chill out.

252
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:41,155
- Wait, it's cool. It's cool.
- Relax.

253
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,244
You okay?
- Yeah. Just give me some water.

254
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:50,164
- You gotta call offense on that shit, Der.
- Not on game point, Danny.

255
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,458
You can't let niggers
get away with that shit.

256
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:56,420
- Honey, it's game point.
- Shut them down, Derek. Kick some ass.

257
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,172
Watch this.

258
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,705
Get that ball.

259
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:33,124
Pass the ball, baby. Pass the ball.

260
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,798
Yeah!

261
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,560
Bye-bye.

262
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,562
Get the fuck off my court.

263
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,981
- This is my house.
- Fuck you, bitch.

264
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,029
- What happened?
- I dropped the ball!

265
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:04,238
Yeah!

266
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:13,748
Get the fuck out of here!
This is my court! Yes!

267
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,172
Yeah.

268
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,885
Derek wouldn't let us visit him in prison.

269
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,095
He said it would make it
too hard for him...

270
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:31,432
...and that if we came,
he wouldn't see us anyhow.

271
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,852
Three years without him,
just wondering...

272
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,774
...and then at 7:00 this morning...

273
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:42,526
...we picked him up outside the gate.

274
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:47,573
Come on, Danny.
Der.

275
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:51,243
The whole ride back,
he didn't say anything.

276
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:55,956
I wanted to stay home, but he said,
"No, go to school. I'll see you later. "

277
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:11,764
Oh, come on. Give the guy a break.

278
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,141
What's the matter?
You too big to give me a hug?

279
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,351
No, man.

280
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:19,563
I just know you'll need someone to look
after you while you adjust to all this space.

281
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,065
Yeah, right.

282
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,819
This place is smaller
than the old living room.

283
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:27,321
- How you doing? How's school?
- It's good. It's good.

284
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,491
You gotta do something about that hair.
That 'do has gotta go.

285
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,786
- I don't know. The girls like it, so...
- Well, I don't.

286
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:36,205
You're keeping it pretty close.
All the way down, huh?

287
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,915
Yeah.

288
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,960
Shit, look, I forgot, man.

289
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:45,172
- It hurt like shit while they put it on.
- When did you get that?

290
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,716
I got it about a month ago.

291
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,301
Cameron made it official.

292
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:52,471
- Cameron?
- Yeah.

293
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,684
- He put this on you?
- Mm-hm. Yeah.

294
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,356
Hello?
- What?

295
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,024
Hi. Just hang on a second.

296
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,277
Derek, it's for you.

297
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,821
Nothing. Nothing.

298
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,406
- There a phone in the back?
- Mm-hm.

299
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,241
I'll get it in the back.

300
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,584
I got it.

301
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,044
Yeah? Oh, hey.

302
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,174
What?

303
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:33,053
My eyes have seen the glory
Of the trampling at the zoo

304
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:38,392
We washed ourselves in niggers' blood
And all the mongrels' too

305
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:43,564
We're taking down the ZOG machine
Jew by Jew, by Jew

306
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:47,234
The white man marches on

307
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,488
You think our friend was behind that?

308
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,574
You know what? I don't even care.

309
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,534
I'm gonna take care of that tonight.

310
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:57,036
Mwah.

311
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:59,246
My sweet kid. My baby boy.

312
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:02,416
God, what's with the love fest, you guys?

313
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:11,091
No, he'll do it.
He'll do it. I'll make sure he does it.

314
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,594
I'll get it.

315
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,937
- Came to see the man.
- Can you fit through the door?

316
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,605
Fuck you!

317
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,192
- Seth.
What's up, Dan?

318
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,319
How you doing? Where's Derek?

319
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:31,529
He's on the phone.

320
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:35,074
Come out, you free motherfucker!
Vinyard, where the fuck are you?

321
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,909
- Vinyard!
- Hang on.

322
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,119
- Give me a minute.
Vinyard!

323
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,580
No, I'll be out in a minute.

324
00:25:56,596 --> 00:26:00,975
I'm being careful. What am I gonna do?
I won't stay in my room the rest of my life.

325
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,227
Hold on.

326
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,564
Hey. Hey. What the fuck
is Seth doing here?

327
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,941
Did you invite him over?

328
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,735
No, he always comes over here.

329
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,655
All right. Danny, give me a minute.

330
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,950
Just give me one minute.

331
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,919
Yeah.

332
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,596
God, are you still here, Goodyear?

333
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,766
You calling me a blimp,
you fucking Democrat?

334
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,354
When was the last time
you were able to see your feet?

335
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,775
Come in here, Danny.

336
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,362
Seth.

337
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,616
Hey, man,
you going to Cam's party tonight?

338
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,701
Is Davina's ass watertight?

339
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:03,162
You're fucking sick, man.

340
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,206
All right, relax.
Let me ask you a few questions.

341
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:09,293
I'm not in the mood.
I got homework to do.

342
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:13,047
Tell me some of the shit you've learned,
fuck-ass, before I pistol-whip you.

343
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:18,385
Okay. I believe in death, destruction,
chaos, filth and greed.

344
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:22,222
Cut the shit, Dan. Come on.
Tell me what I wanna hear, asshole.

345
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:28,228
- You mean that shit about your mother?
- You wanna get fucking beaten, Danny?

346
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:33,233
I'm not fucking talking to you, Davina.
Why don't you shut up?

347
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:36,445
Look, you got to let me do this
my own way, all right?

348
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,406
I'll take care of it.

349
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:41,617
Who do you hate, Danny?

350
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:44,495
I hate anyone that isn't white Protestant.

351
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:45,871
Why?

352
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,540
They're a burden to the advancement
of the white race.

353
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:53,045
- Some of them are all right, I guess.
- None of them are fucking all right, Danny.

354
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,881
They're all fucking freeloaders.
Remember what Cam said?

355
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:59,885
"We don't know them. We don't wanna
know them. They're the fucking enemy. "

356
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,057
What don't you like about them?
And say it with some fucking conviction.

357
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:08,352
I hate the fact that it's cool
to be black these days.

358
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,021
Good.
I hate this hip-hop...

359
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,607
...fucking influence
on white fucking suburbia.

360
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:16,610
- Good.
And I hate Tabitha Soren...

361
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:19,154
...and all her Zionist MTV fucking pigs...

362
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:21,031
...telling us we should get along.

363
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,909
Save the rhetorical bullshit,
Hillary Rodham Clinton...

364
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,953
...because it ain't gonna fucking happen.

365
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,789
That's the best shit I've heard
come out of your mouth.

366
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,625
Danny, no. I feel sorry for you, Danny.

367
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,210
I know you don't believe that.

368
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,713
- Shut up, Davina!
- No, you shut the fuck up!

369
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,465
Get out of the house, you piece of shit!
Please go.

370
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,426
Is that any way to talk to a guest?

371
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:41,677
A friend of the family?

372
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:45,597
- Derek hates you and you don't realize it.
- Hey, how do you know who I hate?

373
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:47,766
Fucking A. Back from the dead.

374
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:50,436
God bless Jesus Christ, man.

375
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:54,231
I think you lost weight, man. I can get
my arms almost all the way around you.

376
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,485
Fifty fucking pounds, man.
Jesus, look at this hair. Holy shit.

377
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:01,655
- Yeah, I told him it's gotta go.
It's good to have you back.

378
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,324
Grab your jacket,
let's get the fuck out of here.

379
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,660
All right. I wanna talk to him one second.

380
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:07,995
Look...

381
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,414
Hey, uh, listen...

382
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,666
...did you pull some shit
in school today?

383
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:16,170
- No, just the usual.
- I'm telling you, man, this kid is awesome.

384
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,840
- Did you turn in a paper on Mein Kampf?
- Yeah.

385
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,216
Awesome.
- You should've...

386
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:23,761
Sweeney probably shit his pants.
- He did, man.

387
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,638
Did Cameron put you up to that?
Did he tell you to do that?

388
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:29,975
No, man, I thought it would be cool.
How'd you know, though?

389
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,852
- How'd you know?
- Doesn't matter how.

390
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,188
This kid is smart as hell.

391
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,273
Was that Sweeney on the phone?

392
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,150
Yeah, Sweeney called.

393
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,152
What are you talking to Sweeney for?

394
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,613
Relax. Listen.
- He's got to get a fucking life.

395
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,532
- He pisses me off.
- Sweeney's a good teacher, all right?

396
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,327
Sweeney is a nigger on a power trip,
Vinyard.

397
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,579
That's what he was like
when we were there.

398
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:53,665
- And it'll never change. Fuck that nigger!
- Hey, Seth.

399
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:56,376
- Seth, go away. Go away.
- What? Are you kidding?

400
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:59,922
Go wait in Danny's room. I wanna
talk to my brother. I'm glad to see you.

401
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:02,633
- I'll be there in one minute.
- Hurry up. I'm starving.

402
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,806
Come here. Seriously, look...

403
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:12,559
Forget this yahoo. He kills bugs for a living.
You don't wanna be like that.

404
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:14,728
I'm serious. It's not funny.

405
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,022
Sweeney is a good teacher.
You can learn from him.

406
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,399
So don't fuck it up
with small-fry shit like that.

407
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:21,068
You got to be smarter than that.

408
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,904
You gotta see the bullshit paper
he's making me write.

409
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,532
I know about it. He told me about it.
I don't care.

410
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:29,243
Do it. You do anything he tells
you to do. I mean it.

411
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,287
I don't want you in trouble in school,
trying to impress me...

412
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,706
...taking this shit in there, all right?

413
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,542
Do you understand what I'm saying?

414
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:39,086
I guess, but I was doing it
because I thought you'd be happy.

415
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,381
Well, I'm not.

416
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:46,218
Shit. Listen to that.

417
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,762
Yeah, I know. It's been getting worse.

418
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,599
All right, don't worry about it.
I'll talk to you about this later.

419
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,434
Okay.
Later.

420
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:59,481
She's coughing her lungs out and
you're blowing this shit in her face all day.

421
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,149
- Put it out.
I'm putting it out.

422
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,442
All right. Come on.

423
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:05,696
Hey. Come on, I wanna talk to you.

424
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:12,703
Mommy, are you okay?

425
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,252
What are you doing? Put that out.

426
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,463
I'm yelling at him for blowing smoke
and you're here sucking on it.

427
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,424
Nice thing to come home to, huh?

428
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,175
Yeah.

429
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:31,763
You all right?

430
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,396
Look...

431
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,065
...you gotta take it easy.
You gotta get some rest.

432
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:45,485
I want you to take Danny's and my room
and we'll hit the couch.

433
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:49,197
- Couch is fine for now.
- No, it's not fine. It's not. This is terrible.

434
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:51,325
We can't live like this.

435
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,535
We gotta get out of here.

436
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,247
Can I go with you?

437
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,792
Yeah, we all gotta get out of here.
That's the point.

438
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,336
I could drop out of school.

439
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:06,340
No. No, absolutely not. You gotta finish.
I'll work something out.

440
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:14,431
Derek, can we please go eat?
I'm fucking starving here.

441
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,683
I don't give a shit!
Go wait in the living room!

442
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:19,353
- God.
- I want him out of my house.

443
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,064
I know, I know. Look.

444
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,498
He's an idiot. He's always been an idiot.

445
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:42,376
Whatever, dude. He can't help it.
I gotta do that paper.

446
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:44,878
Look, I'm gonna catch up with you
later tonight.

447
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,965
Not at Cameron's, all right?
I need you to stay away from there.

448
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:51,510
- Why? I thought we were gonna hang.
- Trust me. I'll explain it later.

449
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:54,638
I need you to stay away from the party,
all right?

450
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,306
- Whatever.
- Hey, I'm not kidding.

451
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,558
Promise me you'll stay
away from that party.

452
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:01,144
I'm not fucking 14 anymore, all right?

453
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,647
Whatever.

454
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,109
God!

455
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,408
Come on, let's go.

456
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,745
- Where are you parked?
- Out back.

457
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,776
- Yeah, that's the whole bunch.
- Right.

458
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:33,570
It didn't take long for Derek
to make a name for himself.

459
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,864
And Cameron knew just how to use it.

460
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,991
You sure you don't wanna
stick around?

461
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,327
You know I'd love to...

462
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:41,995
...but I gotta be careful.

463
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,330
Yeah, I know.

464
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:47,000
- We'll see you back at the house, then.
- Right.

465
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,668
- All right.
- Good luck.

466
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,921
He sent Derek to the kids...

467
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,672
...to the frustrated ones.

468
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:57,010
The ones who were sick of getting their
asses kicked by black and Mexican gangs.

469
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,512
Don't just be some punk...

470
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,930
...be part of something.

471
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,599
All right, let's go. Pull it together.

472
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:07,395
And everybody ate it up.
They did whatever Derek told them to.

473
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,315
Let's go. Come on,
we're not here to fucking socialize.

474
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:14,611
Shut the fuck up.
Check this shit out, man.

475
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:18,698
You want a little toke? Huh? Go ahead.

476
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:21,326
- Curtis, what is that?
- Aw, come on, Derek.

477
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:23,703
Weed is for niggers.
Put that away right now.

478
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:26,873
Aw, Jesus fucking Christ.
- Have a little self-respect.

479
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:32,420
All right, listen up.
We need to open our eyes.

480
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:39,052
There's over 2 million illegal immigrants
bedding down in this state tonight.

481
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:43,765
This state spent $3 billion last year...

482
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:47,310
...on services for people who had
no right to be here in the first place.

483
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,895
Three billion dollars.

484
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:54,109
Four hundred million dollars just to lock up
a bunch of illegal immigrant criminals...

485
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:57,154
...who only got into this country
because the INS decided...

486
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:01,032
...it's not worth the effort
to screen for convicted felons.

487
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:06,663
Who gives a shit?
Our government doesn't give a shit.

488
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,916
Our border policy is a joke.

489
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:14,171
So is anybody surprised that south
of the border they're laughing at us?

490
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,089
- Laughing at our laws.
- Yeah.

491
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:19,092
Every night these parasites
stream across the border...

492
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,844
...like some fucking pinata exploded.

493
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,179
Ha-ha-ha.
- Don't laugh!

494
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:26,683
There's nothing funny going on here.
This is about your life and mine.

495
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:31,146
It's about decent, hardworking Americans
falling through the cracks...

496
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,857
...and getting the shaft.
The government cares about...

497
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:38,528
...the constitutional rights of a bunch of
people who aren't citizens of this country!

498
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:42,657
On the Statue of Liberty, it says, "Give me
your tired, your hungry, your poor. "

499
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,410
Well, it's Americans who are
tired and hungry and poor.

500
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:49,122
And I say until you take care of that,
close the fucking book!

501
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,208
Because we're losing.

502
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:55,128
We're losing our right
to pursue our destiny.

503
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,963
We're losing our freedom...

504
00:36:57,131 --> 00:37:00,967
...so that a bunch of fucking foreigners
can come in and exploit our country.

505
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,970
And this isn't something
that's going on far away.

506
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:07,015
This isn't happening in places
we can't do anything about it.

507
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:11,645
It's happening right here! Right in our
neighborhood. Right in that building.

508
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:15,148
Archie Miller ran that grocery store
since we were kids here.

509
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:18,109
Dave worked there, Mike worked there.

510
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:21,905
He went under, and now some fucking
Korean owns it, who fired these guys...

511
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:26,368
...and is making a killing because
he hired 40 fucking border-jumpers.

512
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:29,913
I see this shit going on and I don't see
anybody doing anything about it.

513
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,915
And it fucking pisses me off!

514
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:36,002
So look around you.

515
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:39,256
This isn't our neighborhood.
It's a battlefield.

516
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:42,384
We're on a battlefield tonight.
Make a decision.

517
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:45,512
Are we gonna stand on the sidelines...

518
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,473
...quietly standing there
while our country gets raped?

519
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,058
Fuck that.

520
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,018
Are we gonna ante up
and do something?

521
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,687
Fuck, yeah!
Hell, yeah!

522
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,105
You're goddamn right we are.

523
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:09,077
Come here!

524
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:13,039
Don't you know it's against the law
to hire border-jumpers, you nip bastard?

525
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:17,002
Fuck that! Fuck that!

526
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:24,092
Sweetheart. No, you don't need this.
We're not gonna hurt you.

527
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,845
Please! Please, no!

528
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,140
You fucking spic!

529
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,854
You know what?
I think this bitch is hungry.

530
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:38,064
This bitch stinks.
Get me cleaning products.

531
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:40,150
Smells like fish and chips
and guacamole.

532
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,609
Here we go.

533
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:43,653
Yeah, that's it.

534
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:00,086
Get the fuck up!

535
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,967
Get down!

536
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,685
Have some fucking beans,
you goddamn beaner.

537
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,020
Yeah!

538
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,689
- Take my job.
- You donkey bitch!

539
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,445
Get some of that in there.

540
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,740
- Throw it on, throw it on.
Hey, that's a great color on you.

541
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:30,700
You can get a white woman's job,
bitch.

542
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,578
A little better than this one, huh?
Yeah.

543
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:36,790
- White.
You can move up in the world, huh?

544
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,876
Asshole!

545
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:45,757
Let's go. We're out of here.
Everybody out. Let's go. Now. Now!

546
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,303
All right, let's go! Let's go!

547
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:53,723
Let's go.
- Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go.

548
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,642
Let's go.

549
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,940
No green card, no fucking work,
comprendes?

550
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,985
- Come on. Come on!
Go, go, go.

551
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:07,487
We're fucking done! Come on!

552
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:37,684
Dad was gone.
But things were almost normal again.

553
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:41,354
Derek had a good job.
Mom was starting to live a little.

554
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:45,692
Everyone was feeling so good
that we just didn't see it coming.

555
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,485
Maybe we should have.

556
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:51,197
The irony is that most of the stores
that were destroyed during the riots...

557
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:53,950
...were owned by black people.
- That's stupid, though.

558
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,577
Why trash your own neighborhood?

559
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:58,538
Well, that's my point.
It's an irrational act.

560
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:03,001
It's like an expression of rage
by people who feel neglected...

561
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,711
...and turned away by the system.

562
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,672
Exactly.
I mean, it's like we had in Watts...

563
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,258
...or the riots in Chicago in '68...

564
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:11,885
I don't buy that for a minute.

565
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:15,722
Calling a riot an irrational expression
of rage, that's such a cop-out.

566
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,349
It's opportunism at its worst.
A bunch of people...

567
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:21,644
...grabbing any excuse they can find
to go and loot a store.

568
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,813
The fact these people ripped off stores...

569
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,649
...in their own communities
reflects that these people...

570
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,610
...have no respect for the law.

571
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:33,156
And certainly no concept of community
or civic responsibility.

572
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:36,910
Wait a minute. White people commit
crimes against white people too.

573
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:40,413
But they're not offing each other
in record numbers all over America.

574
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,415
Look at the statistics, for chrissakes.

575
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:47,003
One in every three black males is in
some phase of the correctional system.

576
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:51,174
Is that a coincidence or do these people
have a racial commitment to crime?

577
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,510
Not only that. They're proud of it.

578
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:56,721
Maybe it says something about prejudice
in the judicial system.

579
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,765
If you wanna talk about
criminal statistics...

580
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:02,602
...you might wanna take a look at
the social inequalities that produce them.

581
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,771
Yap, yap. You know what?
That's exactly what I hate.

582
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,690
You're taking one thing
and calling it something else...

583
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:11,945
...and alleviating the responsibility that
these people have for their own actions.

584
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:13,613
It's like saying:

585
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:17,075
"It's not a riot, it's rage.
It's not crime, it's poverty. "

586
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:21,371
It's just nonsense. It's bullshit.
It's exactly what happened in this trial too.

587
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,958
Because the media twisted things around
so people focused on these cops...

588
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,668
...whether they'd get convicted...

589
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:29,963
...and whether Rodney King's
civil rights had been violated.

590
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:32,257
Everybody lost sight
of Rodney King himself.

591
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:35,385
The guy's a multiple felon
by his own admission.

592
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:39,639
He's high as a goddamn kite, driving
120 miles an hour down the highway.

593
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:43,560
He gets pulled over by a bunch of cops,
and he attacks them.

594
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,312
He attacked police officers.
Bottom line. And he walked.

595
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,316
And there's some yahoo with a video
camera who turned it on halfway through...

596
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,360
...so all we see is them hitting him.

597
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:56,573
Exactly. Powell and Koon winding up
and cracking him with billy clubs...

598
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,284
...and Briseno's kicking him
in the back of the skull.

599
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:01,786
And people are going,
"Oh, this poor guy. "

600
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,162
Poor guy who attacked 4 cops.

601
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:06,249
And those cops end up on the stand
defending themselves...

602
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:09,794
...for using absolutely standard,
textbook self-defense procedures.

603
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,921
I don't think the tape showed that at all.

604
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:15,008
You didn't think so?
And what, you're an authority, Ma?

605
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:17,343
Murray, what do you think?

606
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:22,932
I did think that the police used
their clubs rather excessively.

607
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,436
Who are you to say what's excessive?
I think it was totally appropriate.

608
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,522
They're in a better position
to make that call than you are.

609
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:33,860
In fact, we as society, grant cops a certain
amount of authority to make those calls...

610
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:37,780
...because we acknowledge that their job
is difficult and dangerous.

611
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:41,701
You know? Unfortunately,
very few people, like, respect that authority.

612
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,704
Look who's talking about respect here,
Mr. Junior-KKK.

613
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,831
- What?
- Davina.

614
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:49,876
You wanna go to college, Davina?
You should learn to listen.

615
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:53,046
I didn't say I respected laws.
I acknowledge a cop's authority.

616
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:56,549
I don't respect laws that let monkeys
like Rodney King on the street.

617
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,509
Second, I am not, as you well know...

618
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:03,389
...a member of a low-rent, disorganized
bunch of rednecks like the fucking KKK.

619
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,892
Please. So take your head
out of your ass.

620
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,603
You've gotten off the point.

621
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:13,399
- I had a point. That wasn't the point.
- Do you have one? What is your point?

622
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,401
All right, think about this.

623
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,737
If Danny had been
walking across the street...

624
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:22,283
...and Rodney King had plowed into him...
- Can we just drop this Rodney King thing?

625
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:23,910
Mm-hm.

626
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,710
Who would like some dessert?

627
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:35,588
We're having a discussion.

628
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,007
We're having a nice discussion, right?

629
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:40,843
If Rodney King had been hopped up
on Chivas Regal and PCP...

630
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:43,096
...and killed Danny,
you'd sing a different tune.

631
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:45,807
I didn't see him hit anybody
and neither did you.

632
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:47,725
He didn't happen to kill anybody.

633
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:50,978
- Thank God.
- Keep it down, okay? Ally's sleeping.

634
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:57,777
If he had, though? Come on, think about it.
If that monkey had run some kid over...

635
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:00,863
...everybody would have a different
opinion of this matter.

636
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,741
They'd be focused on Rodney King
and not on these officers.

637
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:06,202
But instead, he just attacked a few cops.

638
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:10,248
Now all the sudden it's Hands Across
America for this total son of a bitch.

639
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,624
I mean, it blows my mind.

640
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,793
We're hung up on this notion
we have some...

641
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,546
...obligation to help
the struggling black man.

642
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:20,299
Cut him some slack until he can overcome
these historical injustices.

643
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:22,885
It's crap. This stuff you guys
are saying perpetuates it.

644
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,429
All this liberal nonsense.

645
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:27,974
Everyone's looking the other way
while our country rots from inside out.

646
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:31,811
Christ, Lincoln freed the slaves,
what, like, 130 years ago?

647
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:34,564
How long does it take
to get your act together?

648
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:37,650
Well, Jews have been persecuted
for over 5000 years.

649
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:41,571
Are you saying that it's wrong
to feel sensitive about anti-Semitism?

650
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:45,992
Forget that. I'm with you.
I am with you all the way, baby.

651
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,996
- I'm sick of these liberal hypocrites.
- Here we go again. I love this part.

652
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:53,082
Well, look at the way that they
scapegoated Chief Gates.

653
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,752
They'd come down that hard
on black Willie Williams?

654
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:59,297
- No way. The video was a setup.
- Jesus Christ. Can I please be excused?

655
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:01,841
- Yes.
- No, you cannot. Don't interrupt.

656
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,844
Excuse me, I was talking.
I listened to you.

657
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,512
The hell do you think you are?

658
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,599
- She's in the middle of a point.
- Who do you think you are?

659
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:10,892
- Sit down!
- No. Fuck you!

660
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:13,311
Sit down! Shut up!
Derek, calm down.

661
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:14,812
- Sit down!
- Derek, calm down.

662
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,356
- Shut up!
- Don't tell him to shut up!

663
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:19,358
- Sit your ass down! No.
- Fuck you, move!

664
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:21,778
- Sit down, shut up!
- Get out of my way! Move!

665
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:23,154
Goddamn it, Derek, move!

666
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,448
Shut your mouth
and give my girlfriend respect.

667
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,867
Derek, what are you trying to prove?

668
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:31,704
Murray, stay out of it! Come here. Hey.
Where do you think you're going?

669
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:35,750
- Derek, let her go! Derek, let her go!
Come here!

670
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:38,169
You need to learn
some fucking manners, Davina.

671
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:41,214
- Shut your fucking mouth! Shut up!
- Derek!

672
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:42,882
Stop!

673
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,092
She can't breathe!

674
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,345
Let her go!

675
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:49,263
Are you gonna apologize?

676
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:51,599
Are you gonna apologize? Are you?

677
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:53,017
You're a fucking asshole.

678
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,728
I hate you!

679
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:06,572
What are you doing, Derek?
This is your family.

680
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:10,243
Right, my family. So you know what?
I don't give two shits about you...

681
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:13,830
...anybody else or what you think.
You're not part of it, never will be.

682
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,249
- That has nothing to do with it!
It doesn't?

683
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:18,000
You don't think I see
what you're doing?

684
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:21,754
You think I'll sit here and smile while
some kike tries to fuck my mother?

685
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:23,798
It's never gonna happen!

686
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:26,968
Fucking forget it. Not on my watch.
Not while I'm in this family.

687
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:30,263
I will fucking cut your Shylock nose off
and stick it up your ass...

688
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,765
...before I let that happen.
Coming in here...

689
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:37,770
...and poisoning my family's dinner with
your Jewish, nigger-loving, hippie bullshit!

690
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,277
Fuck you!

691
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:46,237
Yeah, walk out.

692
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:48,531
Asshole-fucking, Cabala-reading
motherfucker!

693
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,241
Get the fuck out of my house!

694
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:57,415
You see this?
That means "not welcome. "

695
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:11,721
- What did I do?
- You disgust me!

696
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,056
You disgust me! Bring him to our table!

697
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:15,975
Primping your hair and your dress!

698
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:20,229
- Don't touch me! All tarted up!
- What did I do to you?

699
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:23,858
How could you bring him to Dad's table?
How could you go from Dad to that?

700
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:25,151
Aren't you ashamed?

701
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:28,613
I'm ashamed that you came out of my body!

702
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:35,828
Go run to your fucking kike!
Go run to him!

703
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:44,003
It's okay. I'm proud of you, baby.

704
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:52,511
I'm so sorry, Doris.

705
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,847
I really am.

706
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:06,192
- He's gone.
- He's just a boy...

707
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,444
...without a father.

708
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:12,281
Doris, you don't know the world
your children are living in.

709
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:24,001
Goodbye.

710
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:10,881
Hey. You all right?

711
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:16,512
- Take this, you fucking dick!
- Hey, no. No, no, come here!

712
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,847
- Fuck you!
- Calm down!

713
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:19,223
- Let go of me!
- Calm down!

714
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:20,766
Let me go, goddamn it!

715
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:22,935
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
- Fuck you!

716
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,814
I would never hurt you. You know that.

717
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:29,025
Come on, I screwed up. I lost control.

718
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:30,609
It's not you.

719
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:32,111
I'm sorry.

720
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:34,447
Come on, I'd never hurt you guys.
I'd never hurt you.

721
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:36,574
You know that. I'd do anything for you.

722
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:37,950
I don't believe you.

723
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,202
I trust you, Derek.

724
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,255
Hi.

725
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:53,883
Hi. What are you doing out of bed, huh?

726
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,968
- Want a plane ride?
- Yeah.

727
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:57,970
Going for takeoff.

728
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:02,349
- Woo-hoo!
- Heh-heh-heh.

729
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:03,601
Oh, no.

730
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,603
No, no! Don't crash!

731
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,314
Gotta go to Mom.

732
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,316
She's a crazy flier.

733
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:14,153
Kiss Mom. Oh, yeah.

734
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:16,489
Okay.

735
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:25,956
- You don't feel too hot.
- No, it's in my chest.

736
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:28,459
- What are you up to?
- I'm just thinking.

737
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,336
A lot of that going around.

738
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:33,297
- I don't even know how we got here.
- Mom.

739
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:36,092
Like I let you all down.
I don't know when it happened.

740
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,135
Mom, it's okay.

741
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:39,970
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

742
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,766
It's cold in here. No wonder you're sick.

743
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,227
Don't get sick from cold,
you get sick from germs.

744
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:49,688
No, you get sick from smoking.

745
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:53,651
You gotta quit. It's not good for you.

746
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,700
What are you looking at me like that for?

747
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:04,495
When are you gonna let that
beautiful hair grow back?

748
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:08,332
The day you quit smoking.

749
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:12,545
Deal.

750
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,631
I better get Ally to bed.

751
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,216
- Say good night to Mom?
- Mm-hm.

752
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:19,677
Then you have to go to bed. Come on.

753
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,513
- Good night, Mama.
- Good night, baby.

754
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:24,723
Good night, Mom.

755
00:52:56,923 --> 00:53:00,384
I go back to that night
again and again in my mind.

756
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:02,428
I try to stop it from happening.

757
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,597
I want you out of this house.

758
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:07,683
That's fine. I'll be gone in the morning.

759
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,268
He can move in with me.

760
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,897
In my mind,
I imagine what would've happened...

761
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:16,233
...if I hadn't gone into that room
and told him.

762
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:18,861
Danny, get down!

763
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:23,115
No, Danny!

764
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:25,618
Mommy!

765
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:41,592
Nigger, you just fucked with
the wrong bull.

766
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,802
- Come here!
- Get off!

767
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:47,431
You should've learned your place
on the fucking basketball court!

768
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,601
But you fucking monkeys
never get the message!

769
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:53,145
My father gave me that truck,
you motherfucker!

770
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:54,730
You ever shoot at firemen?

771
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,774
You come here, you shoot at my family?

772
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:59,318
I'm gonna teach you a real lesson,
motherfucker.

773
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:01,487
Put your fucking mouth on the curb.

774
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:02,655
Come on, man!

775
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:05,282
Put it on the curb! Right now!

776
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:11,789
- That's it.
- Derek, no!

777
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:16,293
No!

778
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:17,836
Now say good night.

779
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:32,142
Fucker.

780
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:41,235
Drop your weapon!
Put your weapon on the ground!

781
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:43,028
Put your hands up!

782
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:45,197
I said, get your hands up!

783
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:46,865
Now turn around!

784
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:58,961
Put your hands behind your head!

785
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:04,300
Get down on your knees right now!

786
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:04,068
It's all right.

787
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:05,944
It's all right.

788
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:09,281
Let's go.

789
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:12,201
Come on.

790
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:22,669
She ain't gonna open the door?

791
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:25,422
I don't know.
Someone's there looking at us. Hello?

792
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,049
Danny, it's for you.

793
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:30,135
I'll be right there.

794
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:46,068
Open the door, Danny!
It's fucking freezing!

795
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:48,153
Danny, this party's gonna be sick!

796
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:51,156
Come on, Danny!

797
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:24,022
I'm gonna go get some beers.

798
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:38,370
Hey, what a party, huh, fat Seth?

799
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:41,457
I'm not fat, asshole! I'm husky.

800
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,293
What the fuck's up, Seth?

801
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,545
Drink up, Danny,
before your brother sees you.

802
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:47,921
Holy fuck. He's here?

803
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:49,798
- Yeah, he's here.
- He's fucking here.

804
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:52,176
- Go pay your respects.
- Fuck you, Seth.

805
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,889
Let's go talk to Cameron, Danny.

806
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,601
- Father Vinyard?
- How's it going? I'm Jason, this is Chris.

807
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:03,770
- We're friends with your brother.
- You are a fucking god, man!

808
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:06,231
- Oh, shit, yeah.
Derek!

809
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:12,321
Hey.

810
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:25,501
- I thought you turned that paper in.
- I did...

811
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,586
...and now fucking Murray
turned me in...

812
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:30,964
...and so Sweeney's
making me write another one.

813
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:35,719
Good old Sweeney.
He never stops trying, now, does he?

814
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:39,640
He's one of those proud-to-be-nigger
people. I hate those guys.

815
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:41,517
Now, wait a minute, Danny.

816
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:43,393
He's not proud.

817
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:49,233
He's a manipulative,
self-righteous Uncle Tom.

818
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:53,570
He's trying to make you feel guilty
about writing about Adolf Hitler. Yeah.

819
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:57,407
Some nigger, some spic writes about
Martin Luther King...

820
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:59,576
...or fucking Cesar "Commie" Chavez...

821
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:01,537
- Heh-heh-heh.
... gets a pat on the head.

822
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:03,455
Yeah.

823
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:07,042
I mean, you can see the hypocrisy
in that, can't you?

824
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:09,878
Definitely.

825
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:14,925
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

826
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:16,134
No, listen to me.

827
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:22,808
I wanna see you, okay? I do.
But I gotta take care of something tonight.

828
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:27,312
- Okay.
- You understand?

829
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,983
Yeah. I'm here.
When you're ready, I'm here.

830
00:59:34,445 --> 00:59:37,155
- Look, would you do something with me?
- Anything.

831
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:40,158
Leave with me.

832
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:43,328
- Leave where?
- Leave here. Leave all this.

833
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:45,622
Just come with me.

834
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:49,334
Why would you wanna leave? They
worship you. You're like a god to them.

835
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:51,253
If you think we had it good before...

836
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:54,214
...wait till you see what it's like now.
- I don't want all that.

837
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:58,010
I don't want my family involved.
Everything I've done here has fucked it up.

838
00:59:58,177 --> 01:00:01,179
- Do you understand?
- You think what you did was wrong?

839
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,099
Oh, baby. Oh, come on.

840
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:06,643
Those niggers got exactly
what they deserved...

841
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:08,770
...and we all know that.

842
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:10,439
I understand you just got out...

843
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:13,191
...but no one's gonna hurt you.
No one can touch you.

844
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:14,818
There's a small army out there.

845
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:17,321
We won't let a bunch of spooks
kick us out of here.

846
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:20,616
Stacey, you're not listening to me, okay?
I'm not scared.

847
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:21,950
I don't want it anymore.

848
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:25,454
I'm done with it. I'm through with this.

849
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:27,372
It's...

850
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,791
It's bullshit, Stacey.

851
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:33,420
Listen, you don't need this, Stacey.
Come on, trust me.

852
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:36,673
If you wanna be with me,
just trust me. Come with me.

853
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:38,884
Come on.

854
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:40,093
You're nuts.

855
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:42,220
You are nuts. No way.

856
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:45,349
I don't think you realize
what's been going on here.

857
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:49,186
We are 10 times what we were,
and we are bloody organized.

858
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:51,563
I mean, it is like nothing
you have ever seen!

859
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:53,065
This is a mistake. Forget it.

860
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:56,068
Wait a second. Wait a second.
What was a mistake?

861
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:58,320
Stacey, just say goodbye.
Just say goodbye.

862
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,530
This isn't you.

863
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:03,241
- I know you.
- You don't know anything about me, Stacey.

864
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:13,043
- Hey. Are you Danny's brother?
- Yeah.

865
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:14,836
Tell him Lizzy's looking for him.

866
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:17,214
Lizzy. Thank you.

867
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:23,929
We'll let the niggers, kikes and spics
grab for their piece of the pie.

868
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:25,389
Can't blame them.

869
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:29,893
Of course,
they're gonna have to fight to get it.

870
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:33,855
And if we scare the fuck out of people...

871
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:37,567
...and a few people get killed
in the process, so be it.

872
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:41,238
You gonna put that
in your paper, Danny?

873
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:45,283
- Ha, ha. Hey, man.
- Well, look who's here.

874
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:47,369
The return of the soldier.

875
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:52,541
- What are you doing here, Danny?
- Come on, man. I had to check it out.

876
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,752
- You knew I was gonna come.
Let the kid alone, Derek.

877
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:57,796
He knows when to go to bed.

878
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:03,009
- Go wait outside.
- Come on, I'm not doing anything.

879
01:02:03,177 --> 01:02:05,137
There's a little blond sitting out there.

880
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:08,473
She keeps asking for you.
She's dying. Come on.

881
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:10,851
- Well, I gotta check out.
- Go easy on her.

882
01:02:11,018 --> 01:02:12,978
All right.

883
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:18,942
Wait for me right outside.

884
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:25,157
Take it easy.

885
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:27,284
Chill out.

886
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:30,078
You're on safe ground.

887
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:33,498
You don't have to watch your ass
around here.

888
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:37,294
Come on, sit down. Relax.

889
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:41,173
I'm sorry. The party was a little quick.

890
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:44,885
But we're just so damned glad
you're back, Derek.

891
01:02:45,052 --> 01:02:48,430
- It's only natural you should feel funny.
- I don't feel funny, Cam.

892
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:53,185
You know, you made the fat kid nervous.
He thinks the joint messed with your mind.

893
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:54,686
It did.

894
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:05,489
Glory, glory hallelujah

895
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:10,660
Glory, glory hallelujah

896
01:03:10,828 --> 01:03:14,039
The white man marches on

897
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:17,209
Things have changed
since you've been gone, Derek.

898
01:03:17,376 --> 01:03:19,377
You talk about organization?

899
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:22,214
Wait till you see
what we've done with the Internet.

900
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:26,051
We've got every gang from Seattle
to San Diego working together now.

901
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:28,470
They're not competing.
They're consolidated.

902
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:31,014
Only thing we lack
is a little overall leadership.

903
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:33,934
And that's where you come in.

904
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:37,312
Because people out there
got a lot of respect for you, Derek.

905
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:41,733
- When you're ready, talk to me about it.
- Well, you can forget about that.

906
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:44,069
I'm done with it, Cam.

907
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:47,072
Yeah, well, I know you grew out of that...

908
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:50,575
...shaved-head bullshit
a long time ago, thank God.

909
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:52,410
I like your hair the way it is now.

910
01:03:52,578 --> 01:03:54,996
See, that's what I mean.
We're thinking bigger now.

911
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:57,916
- No more of this grocery store...
- You're not listening.

912
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:01,461
I am done with it. All that bullshit
out there and all your bullshit too.

913
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,129
I'm out.

914
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:06,341
I understand how you feel.
You've just done some hard time...

915
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:08,426
Don't fucking talk to me about hard time.

916
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:10,720
- You don't know a thing about it.
- I done mine.

917
01:04:10,888 --> 01:04:13,139
You didn't do shit.
I found out about your story.

918
01:04:13,307 --> 01:04:16,935
You did two months, then rolled over
on two kids and let them go down for you.

919
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:19,104
So don't feed me your fucking lies,
Cameron!

920
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:22,858
All right, then. This is stupid.

921
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:24,526
I'm done.

922
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:27,070
Look, you go cool off.
Get laid. Do something.

923
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:29,948
Get your head on straight,
then I'll talk to you.

924
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:32,075
But it doesn't matter if I don't, does it?

925
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:34,536
You got the next crop
all lined up and ready to go...

926
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:37,789
...you fucking chicken hawk!
- Excuse me?

927
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:40,417
You prey on people, Cam! You use them!

928
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:43,378
I lost three years of my life
for your fucking phony cause...

929
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:45,422
...but I am onto you,
you fucking snake.

930
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:48,133
Hey, Derek. Watch it. Be careful.

931
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:49,551
Remember where you are.

932
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:53,263
This is not a fucking country club
where you can waltz in and out of here...

933
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:55,098
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

934
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:58,351
I came in here to tell you one thing:
I am out. Out!

935
01:04:58,519 --> 01:04:59,644
And Danny is out too.

936
01:04:59,812 --> 01:05:02,272
You come near my family again,
I'll fucking kill you.

937
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,774
Well, excuse me, but fuck you, Derek.

938
01:05:04,942 --> 01:05:07,110
You can't come barking threats at me.

939
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:09,821
You can do whatever you want,
but Danny is a good kid.

940
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:14,075
He's not some whining pussy like you.
He needs my help and I'll give it to him.

941
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:15,952
If you come near Danny again...

942
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:19,080
...I will feed you your fucking heart,
Cameron.

943
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:21,041
I won't have to.

944
01:05:22,209 --> 01:05:24,002
He'll come to me.

945
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:27,589
I'm more important to him now
than you'll ever be.

946
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:32,969
Shit!

947
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:36,056
You're a fucking dead man, Vinyard.

948
01:05:51,405 --> 01:05:53,198
Hey, hey, hey. Where's Cameron?

949
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:54,532
Where the fuck is he?

950
01:05:55,534 --> 01:05:57,702
- Hey, Derek.
- Hey, Derek.

951
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:59,579
Stay away from me, Stacey. Danny!

952
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:01,998
Why don't you share
what you just said to me...

953
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:04,960
...you piece-of-shit, race-trading nigger!

954
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:07,212
Fucking nigger?
- You monkey-fucking traitor!

955
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,047
Are you a fucking nigger?

956
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:11,049
Hey, Danny! Come on.

957
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:13,176
He's a fucking nigger. Nigger. Nigger.

958
01:06:13,344 --> 01:06:14,636
Cam's out cold!

959
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:16,554
Where the fuck are you going?

960
01:06:17,723 --> 01:06:19,557
He's got a gun!

961
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:22,435
- Yo, yo, back up, back up.
Seth.

962
01:06:22,603 --> 01:06:25,021
You make me fucking sick!

963
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:27,315
Seth! Put down the fucking gun!

964
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:28,566
Go ahead. Shoot.

965
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:32,404
- Shoot him! Do it, Seth! Shoot him!
Seth. Holy shit.

966
01:06:32,571 --> 01:06:33,697
Traitor.
- Kick his ass.

967
01:06:33,864 --> 01:06:36,074
- Seth!
- Do it, Seth, do it.

968
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:37,867
- Shoot him.
Do it! Shoot him!

969
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:39,786
Oh, God.

970
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:41,037
Back up. Move.

971
01:06:43,207 --> 01:06:45,417
Back up. Back up. Back the fuck up.

972
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:47,919
Move. Move.

973
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:49,212
Easy, Derek. Hey. Hey.

974
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:13,278
- Danny, easy.
- Fuck you. Who do you think you are?

975
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:15,280
Danny, Danny. Relax. Relax.

976
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:18,950
- Who do you think you are?
- Danny. Take it easy, Dan. Take it easy.

977
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:21,453
I fucking hate you, Der!

978
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:23,538
All right. Shh, shh. I mean it.

979
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:26,541
Hey, come on. Come on.
Shut up. Shut up.

980
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:28,793
- Take it easy.
- What's happened to you, Der?

981
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:31,963
Take it easy. Take it easy.

982
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:34,299
What's happened to you, Der?

983
01:07:42,808 --> 01:07:45,226
Come on. Come on.

984
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:50,315
This is so fucked.

985
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:51,983
Look. I'm sorry. All right?

986
01:07:52,151 --> 01:07:54,778
You weren't supposed to see that.
I told you not to come.

987
01:07:54,945 --> 01:07:57,155
Fuck you, man.

988
01:07:57,656 --> 01:07:59,115
That was so fucked up.

989
01:07:59,283 --> 01:08:01,201
I know. I know.

990
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:04,204
- God.
- It wasn't supposed to happen that way.

991
01:08:04,371 --> 01:08:05,914
That was fucked up.

992
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:08,500
- That's all there is to it.
- Not what I had planned.

993
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:11,252
It just all went to shit.

994
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:13,505
It went to shit.

995
01:08:13,672 --> 01:08:15,131
Totally out of control.

996
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:19,344
What's fucking happening to you, man?

997
01:08:24,683 --> 01:08:26,476
Hey. Look at me.

998
01:08:29,855 --> 01:08:31,356
I can't go back to that, Dan.

999
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:33,691
Can't go back to what?

1000
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:38,363
To any of it. Those guys, the gang,
that life. I'm done with it.

1001
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:44,035
What happened to you up there?

1002
01:08:52,002 --> 01:08:55,964
C Block! Back at the chow!
Don't be late today, you piece of shit!

1003
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:57,841
Let's go! You wanna eat today?

1004
01:08:58,008 --> 01:09:00,009
Get up! Five minutes!

1005
01:09:00,177 --> 01:09:02,345
This is my fucking house! Get up!

1006
01:09:02,513 --> 01:09:04,722
What the fuck's your problem,
you asshole?

1007
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:06,516
Move!

1008
01:09:06,684 --> 01:09:07,976
Joe, open the fucking gates.

1009
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:09,936
All right, back up.

1010
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:17,152
Five minutes. Step forward.

1011
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:19,529
Those beds better be made.

1012
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:25,577
After two days in that place,
I didn't think I'd make it a week.

1013
01:09:25,744 --> 01:09:27,245
Come on there, motherfuckers.

1014
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:29,581
You wanna eat today, you piece of shit?

1015
01:09:29,748 --> 01:09:33,084
You white-trash piece of shit.
You think you're fucking special?

1016
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:36,754
Button that top button. Let's go! Move!

1017
01:09:36,922 --> 01:09:40,049
Are you fucking eyeballing me?
Don't eyeball-fuck me, asshole.

1018
01:09:40,217 --> 01:09:42,385
I'll fucking kill you.

1019
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:45,597
Fucking keep my eye on you,
you white piece of shit.

1020
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:50,435
Don't fucking eyeball me, boy,
or I'll fucking skull-fuck you!

1021
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:52,353
Step forward.

1022
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:55,773
Turn to the left.

1023
01:09:56,942 --> 01:09:59,277
Step forward to chow. Let's go.

1024
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:01,446
Come on.

1025
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:04,032
Hey, fish, straight ahead.
Straight ahead, fucker.

1026
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,241
Let's go.

1027
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:08,369
All the wrong people
knew who I was anyway...

1028
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:11,831
...so I figured I'm just gonna put up a flag
and hope a friend sees it.

1029
01:11:15,187 --> 01:11:16,938
That's the catapult right there.

1030
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:38,042
- How you doing?
- Good.

1031
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:39,711
Have a seat.

1032
01:11:41,213 --> 01:11:44,090
- Spike. Good to meet you.
- Hey.

1033
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:56,728
Don't fuck with me, all right? Because
I'm the most dangerous man in this prison.

1034
01:11:57,604 --> 01:11:58,813
You know why?

1035
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,607
Because I control the underwear.

1036
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:11,951
All right, we pick them up over here
and we sort them over there.

1037
01:12:12,119 --> 01:12:14,912
I hope you work out, all right?
The last guy they sent me...

1038
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:19,042
...didn't wear no drawers,
couldn't read the sizes in the drawers...

1039
01:12:19,209 --> 01:12:21,002
...and used to sniff the drawers.

1040
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:23,254
We got two sizes: Medium and large.
All right?

1041
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:25,882
All you do is put the mediums
with the mediums...

1042
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:27,592
...and the large with the large.

1043
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:31,346
It's a boring job, but it's better than
that last shit they had me doing.

1044
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:35,767
I spent two years in the kitchen, ha,
scrubbing hot-ass pots and pans.

1045
01:12:35,934 --> 01:12:38,728
That, you don't wanna do. All right?

1046
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:40,938
You should be happy
that you landed this job.

1047
01:12:41,106 --> 01:12:44,442
Ain't no telling what the hell
they'll have you do in the joint.

1048
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:47,320
By the way, uh...

1049
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:50,365
...what are you in for?

1050
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:55,620
Probably robbed some old lady, huh?

1051
01:13:06,965 --> 01:13:09,092
Okay, I know your kind, right?

1052
01:13:09,259 --> 01:13:11,469
Badass peckerwood with an attitude.

1053
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:15,223
Well, let me tell you something, man.

1054
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:17,100
You better watch your ass.

1055
01:13:17,267 --> 01:13:19,018
Because in the joint...

1056
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:21,145
...you the nigger, not me.

1057
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:28,736
I was a year in. I thought I was cruising.

1058
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:31,656
Then everything
started getting complicated.

1059
01:13:56,723 --> 01:13:58,349
I'll take care of that, all right?

1060
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:00,143
What the fuck is that?

1061
01:14:01,895 --> 01:14:03,479
What's that all about?

1062
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:06,858
Oh, that's just politics, man.
Favors, you know.

1063
01:14:09,027 --> 01:14:11,112
He's doing favors for that fucking spic?

1064
01:14:13,073 --> 01:14:17,201
Mitch has got a little something extra
on the side with them boys, you know.

1065
01:14:17,911 --> 01:14:19,287
You're kidding, right?

1066
01:14:20,372 --> 01:14:21,456
No.

1067
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:25,501
That's bullshit, man.
Somebody should say something to him.

1068
01:14:25,669 --> 01:14:27,253
What the fuck is he thinking?

1069
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:29,714
Mitch is the only reason
why you're not a corpse.

1070
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:33,092
- Remember that.
- You know what? I don't fucking give a shit.

1071
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:36,387
I can take care of myself.
He shouldn't be doing that.

1072
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:39,557
I'm getting sick of it.
A lot of hard talk around here...

1073
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:41,976
...and not a lot of follow-through.

1074
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:46,230
I think you'd better chill out...

1075
01:14:46,398 --> 01:14:50,193
...on the preaching bullshit, okay?
We're getting a little tired of that shit.

1076
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:53,738
Ease up on it.

1077
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:25,478
What are you doing here, Doris?

1078
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:27,271
I was in the neighborhood.

1079
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:30,066
Well, look, I told you I don't want you
all coming here.

1080
01:15:30,234 --> 01:15:33,110
I don't care what you told me, okay?

1081
01:15:33,278 --> 01:15:34,570
I need to talk to you now.

1082
01:15:55,676 --> 01:15:56,717
So how is everyone?

1083
01:15:56,885 --> 01:16:02,306
Davina's great.
She's, uh, getting straight A's almost.

1084
01:16:02,474 --> 01:16:04,725
And, uh, Ally's walking...

1085
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:07,061
...and starting to talk a little.

1086
01:16:11,775 --> 01:16:14,735
- How's Danny?
- Danny?

1087
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:17,572
Danny.

1088
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:21,409
He holds you up so high.

1089
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:23,995
He thinks you're the greatest.

1090
01:16:24,913 --> 01:16:27,957
He's always bragging about you
to Cameron...

1091
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:29,917
...and all his new friends.

1092
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:35,715
He's starting to remind me of you.

1093
01:16:35,882 --> 01:16:38,551
Jesus, don't sound so worried, all right?

1094
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:40,219
I'm sure he's fine.

1095
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:44,181
I mean, he's 16 years old, Doris.
He's not gonna be a little angel forever.

1096
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:48,019
You think because I watched
my first-born fuck up his entire life...

1097
01:16:48,186 --> 01:16:52,189
...that I can sit here and see my baby
follow him down the same toilet?

1098
01:16:52,357 --> 01:16:54,984
You know what?
I can't fix all this shit from up here, okay?

1099
01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:56,527
I'm not asking you to.

1100
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:59,864
It makes me feel bad. I'm trying to get
through this, you make it harder.

1101
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:03,034
You think you're the only one
doing time, Derek?

1102
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:05,620
You think you're here all alone?

1103
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:07,622
You think I'm not in here with you?

1104
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:21,677
Fuck, man.

1105
01:17:24,973 --> 01:17:28,726
Every day you go through these sheets
like you gonna get to the end of them.

1106
01:17:29,728 --> 01:17:32,313
Look, nigga, will you chill the fuck out?

1107
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:35,691
Goddamn! No matter how fast
you get through them, man...

1108
01:17:35,859 --> 01:17:38,361
...they'll keep bringing them in
and bringing them in.

1109
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:42,239
Throwing them around ain't gonna do
a thing but give you a heart attack.

1110
01:17:42,407 --> 01:17:43,908
Know what? That's cool with me.

1111
01:17:44,076 --> 01:17:46,494
But you're gonna give me
a goddamn heart attack too!

1112
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:57,755
I know, I know.
I'm just a dumb stupid nigger, right?

1113
01:17:57,923 --> 01:17:59,632
What do I know?

1114
01:18:01,093 --> 01:18:04,303
I know I ain't the one getting mad
at them damn sheets, though.

1115
01:18:04,888 --> 01:18:08,891
As a matter of fact, the only sheets
I get mad at? I'll tell you.

1116
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:13,604
"Boys, this is what we gonna do.

1117
01:18:13,772 --> 01:18:15,439
We gonna hate some niggers.

1118
01:18:15,607 --> 01:18:19,443
We gonna hate some goddamn niggers.
That's all we'll do, is hate niggers all day.

1119
01:18:19,611 --> 01:18:22,029
I don't know what a nigger is,
but we'll hate them.

1120
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:24,115
My cousin Derek
is in the pen right now...

1121
01:18:24,282 --> 01:18:28,369
...working next to a nigger,
driving him nigger crazy. "

1122
01:18:46,596 --> 01:18:48,889
See? That's the ticket.

1123
01:18:49,933 --> 01:18:51,851
Nice and easy.

1124
01:18:52,686 --> 01:18:54,478
Now we can ignore each other in peace.

1125
01:18:58,525 --> 01:19:00,568
I go, "What you doing?"
Know what he tells me?

1126
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:03,821
He goes, "It's better than the pig
I just tried to fuck. "

1127
01:19:06,825 --> 01:19:08,117
Never lets me finish.

1128
01:19:08,285 --> 01:19:10,995
Why don't you tell a joke?
Did you fuck him too?

1129
01:19:12,664 --> 01:19:16,959
I get back, she's laying on her back.
She likes the wine bottle thing, right?

1130
01:19:18,003 --> 01:19:19,670
What's up?

1131
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:27,803
Will you get to the fucking point?
Jesus Christ.

1132
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:37,855
He was taking it from the Mexicans
and dealing it out to his own people.

1133
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:41,484
He didn't believe in shit.
None of them did.

1134
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:43,736
Took too damn long.

1135
01:19:51,244 --> 01:19:53,120
Hey. Hey, Vinyard!

1136
01:20:06,927 --> 01:20:08,511
What?

1137
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:11,597
Come on, man. Don't look at me like that.

1138
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:14,141
You know what that smells like, right?

1139
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:17,394
Come on, don't tell me this smell
doesn't remind you of a woman.

1140
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:20,356
God, I miss that smell, man.

1141
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:24,819
The job I had on the outside
wasn't much better than this one.

1142
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:28,572
But at least I gotta go home at night
and lie down next to this sweet smell.

1143
01:20:31,743 --> 01:20:33,536
God, I miss that.

1144
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:36,205
You got a woman?

1145
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:37,873
Yeah, you got a woman, man.

1146
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:40,709
Let me give you some advice. All right?

1147
01:20:40,919 --> 01:20:42,920
She comes to visit you...

1148
01:20:43,713 --> 01:20:47,591
...whatever you do, no matter what,
don't let her leave here in a fight.

1149
01:20:47,759 --> 01:20:50,845
Don't let her walk out of here
with a bad attitude. If you do...

1150
01:20:51,012 --> 01:20:55,766
...you spend next week wondering if she's
getting her fuck on with somebody else.

1151
01:20:55,934 --> 01:20:59,228
She comes to see you it's nothing
but sweet talk through that glass.

1152
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:01,772
Send her away floating, all right?

1153
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:04,942
Because it's not like the real world.
Where you can fight...

1154
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:08,696
...but it's cool to fight because you
can make up and have make-up sex.

1155
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:11,949
You know what I'm saying? That angry sex.
That sex with an attitude.

1156
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:15,619
Where you lay on your back and let her
take out all that aggression on you.

1157
01:21:15,787 --> 01:21:17,705
All guys know that, man.
That's that good sex.

1158
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:19,874
It's that pow, pow, pow.

1159
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:22,877
Let her get on top
and she's gonna punish you first, right?

1160
01:21:23,044 --> 01:21:24,545
"You been a bad boy, huh?

1161
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:27,423
You been a bad boy
and I'm gonna punish you.

1162
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:32,720
I'm gonna put it on you.
Don't you ever let me catch you...

1163
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:34,471
...looking at another woman.

1164
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:37,516
Yeah. I may forgive you if you bring it.

1165
01:21:37,684 --> 01:21:40,019
I think I can. I forgive.

1166
01:21:40,186 --> 01:21:43,689
I forgive. Oh, right there. Right there.
You hitting it. My spot.

1167
01:21:43,857 --> 01:21:47,985
That's it. Right. Yeah. Yeah.
Yes. I forgive you.

1168
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:51,655
I forgive you. I for... I for... I forgive you.

1169
01:21:51,823 --> 01:21:53,824
I love you!"

1170
01:21:57,662 --> 01:21:59,330
Let's keep it moving.

1171
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:15,095
How do you figure the Lakers to ever
be a bigger dynasty than the Celtics?

1172
01:22:15,263 --> 01:22:18,474
- The Lakers are like a flare-up. A fluke.
- Are you crazy?

1173
01:22:18,642 --> 01:22:21,602
One good coach for four years.
The Celtics are like a dynasty!

1174
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:26,190
Come on, man. The Celtics were, like,
the ugliest team in the history of sports.

1175
01:22:26,358 --> 01:22:28,275
A dynasty of ugly motherfuckers, man.

1176
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:30,486
Look at Kevin McHale.

1177
01:22:30,654 --> 01:22:33,322
James Worthy?
The guy has a head like a melon.

1178
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:36,033
- No, he had ladies.
- I can't even talk to you.

1179
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:38,869
- I don't even know what you're saying.
- You are tweaking.

1180
01:22:39,037 --> 01:22:41,121
Boston Celtics.

1181
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:42,623
- How many is that?
- That's enough.

1182
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:44,375
Enough? All right.

1183
01:22:53,677 --> 01:22:55,552
I lost count, man.

1184
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:57,554
- Doesn't matter, man.
- All right.

1185
01:22:57,722 --> 01:22:59,556
Who's counting anyway?

1186
01:23:06,564 --> 01:23:08,524
All right, so I wanna know something.

1187
01:23:10,068 --> 01:23:11,568
What the fuck landed you in here?

1188
01:23:11,736 --> 01:23:13,821
You didn't kill.
Too skinny for a gangbanger.

1189
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:17,992
That a bitch. Don't judge a book by its
cover. I can throw these things, all right?

1190
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:21,412
- You know what I'm saying?
- Whatever. Come on. What did you do?

1191
01:23:21,579 --> 01:23:25,416
Yo, man, it's none of your business,
all right? It's embarrassing, all right?

1192
01:23:27,085 --> 01:23:29,795
What? Embar...?
Everybody in here is embarrassed.

1193
01:23:29,963 --> 01:23:32,923
You think? Nobody in here
got away with anything.

1194
01:23:33,299 --> 01:23:34,925
What did you do?

1195
01:23:36,636 --> 01:23:39,763
Look, man, I stole a TV, all right?

1196
01:23:39,973 --> 01:23:41,765
So you stole a TV.
What's embarrassing?

1197
01:23:41,933 --> 01:23:46,020
I stole a TV from a store that was right
next door to a doughnut shop, all right?

1198
01:23:46,187 --> 01:23:49,106
I run out, the store owner's
running behind me, yelling, bam.

1199
01:23:49,274 --> 01:23:51,692
I run into three cops, all right?

1200
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:53,944
I told you it was embarrassing
and you laugh.

1201
01:23:54,112 --> 01:23:56,280
Wait a second. Wait a second.

1202
01:23:57,282 --> 01:23:58,907
That doesn't make sense.

1203
01:23:59,993 --> 01:24:02,369
No, you didn't get six years
for stealing a TV.

1204
01:24:02,537 --> 01:24:05,789
- Come on.
- I go in the store, I come out...

1205
01:24:05,957 --> 01:24:09,293
...the police officer grabs my arm,
TV falls on his foot and breaks it.

1206
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:11,628
They said I threw the TV at the officer.

1207
01:24:11,796 --> 01:24:13,756
Assault. Six years.

1208
01:24:13,923 --> 01:24:15,758
Come on. Tell the truth.

1209
01:24:15,925 --> 01:24:17,801
You chucked it at him. Or something.

1210
01:24:17,969 --> 01:24:20,929
Like I said, I came out of the store...

1211
01:24:21,097 --> 01:24:24,641
...he grabbed my arm, it fell on his foot.

1212
01:24:29,564 --> 01:24:33,442
What you got for me, baby?
What you got for me? What you got for me?

1213
01:24:34,611 --> 01:24:36,862
There you go, baby. Yeah, baby.

1214
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:38,989
That's what I'm talking about!

1215
01:24:43,286 --> 01:24:44,870
Put some D on him, now.

1216
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:18,028
Fuck you.

1217
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:20,030
Get a towel! Hold him. Hold him.

1218
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:30,040
- You wanna be a nigger, sweet boy?
- Fuck you!

1219
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:32,543
We're gonna treat you like one.

1220
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:35,379
Come on.

1221
01:25:49,978 --> 01:25:51,228
Fuck you.

1222
01:25:56,734 --> 01:25:58,318
- That was real sweet.
- Fuck you!

1223
01:26:31,895 --> 01:26:33,937
How is he?

1224
01:26:34,105 --> 01:26:36,064
Well, he took six stitches.

1225
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:45,657
Hey, man.

1226
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:20,484
Oh, man, what the hell
are you doing here, anyway?

1227
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:24,321
Well, I came to talk about Danny,
but we don't have to do that right now.

1228
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:25,739
I brought you some books.

1229
01:27:28,409 --> 01:27:31,328
Well, what about him? You know?
Don't keep me in suspense.

1230
01:27:31,955 --> 01:27:33,997
He's headed right where you are.

1231
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:39,086
Oh, man, you know what? My mother
already laid this trip on me, man.

1232
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:41,380
Danny's not my responsibility.
You know?

1233
01:27:41,547 --> 01:27:45,050
What do you expect me to do? It
doesn't help. Am I supposed to feel guilty?

1234
01:27:45,218 --> 01:27:49,513
I don't want you to do anything. I need
to know the truth about how you feel.

1235
01:27:49,681 --> 01:27:52,891
Well, what?
You think I want him in here? I mean...

1236
01:27:53,059 --> 01:27:56,311
I don't know. I don't know what I feel.
I'm all...

1237
01:27:58,314 --> 01:27:59,856
I feel a little inside out.

1238
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:03,694
Um, you know, I don't know.
There's some things...

1239
01:28:04,362 --> 01:28:06,029
...that don't fit.

1240
01:28:06,197 --> 01:28:07,990
Well, that happens.

1241
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:11,868
Look, you are too damn smart
to be floating around here...

1242
01:28:12,036 --> 01:28:14,621
...pretending you don't see
the holes in this bullshit.

1243
01:28:14,789 --> 01:28:17,791
Listen, I said I was confused.
I didn't say I didn't believe in it.

1244
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:20,335
All right.
That's why you have to stay open.

1245
01:28:21,087 --> 01:28:23,046
Right now, your anger is consuming you.

1246
01:28:23,214 --> 01:28:26,216
Your anger is shutting down the brain
God gave you.

1247
01:28:26,384 --> 01:28:29,886
You've been talking about what's going
on in me since I was in high school.

1248
01:28:30,054 --> 01:28:33,056
How the fuck do you know so much
about what's going on inside me?

1249
01:28:33,224 --> 01:28:35,350
No, I know about me.

1250
01:28:35,518 --> 01:28:39,730
I know about this place.
I know about the place you are in.

1251
01:28:40,273 --> 01:28:42,399
What do you know
about the place I'm in?

1252
01:28:42,567 --> 01:28:44,443
There was a moment...

1253
01:28:44,610 --> 01:28:47,446
...when I used to blame
everything and everyone...

1254
01:28:47,613 --> 01:28:51,700
...for all the pain and suffering
and vile things that happened to me...

1255
01:28:51,868 --> 01:28:54,244
...that I saw happen to my people.

1256
01:28:55,204 --> 01:28:57,122
I used to blame everybody.
Blame white people.

1257
01:28:57,290 --> 01:28:59,875
Blame society. Blame God.

1258
01:29:00,293 --> 01:29:03,920
I didn't get no answers, because
I was asking the wrong questions.

1259
01:29:04,088 --> 01:29:06,757
- You have to ask the right questions.
- Like what?

1260
01:29:09,552 --> 01:29:12,095
Has anything you've done
made your life better?

1261
01:29:23,107 --> 01:29:24,441
No.

1262
01:29:32,658 --> 01:29:34,034
You gotta help me now.

1263
01:29:37,205 --> 01:29:38,955
Just help me.

1264
01:29:40,458 --> 01:29:42,459
Get me out of here, you know?

1265
01:29:45,463 --> 01:29:48,215
I'm up in four months for review.

1266
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:51,551
Put in a word for me.

1267
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:54,137
I already have.
So you're out there, then what?

1268
01:29:54,305 --> 01:29:56,973
I don't wanna fuck up
my family anymore.

1269
01:29:57,141 --> 01:29:59,309
I'll go as far away as I can get.

1270
01:29:59,977 --> 01:30:01,103
That's not good enough.

1271
01:30:02,563 --> 01:30:07,109
You want my help, you gotta do better
than that. My help is not unconditional.

1272
01:30:08,111 --> 01:30:11,071
But running just ain't good enough.

1273
01:30:44,021 --> 01:30:45,313
Fuck him.

1274
01:30:45,481 --> 01:30:48,150
Fuck him. Fuck him.
Let the niggers have him.

1275
01:30:49,944 --> 01:30:51,695
Yo, what's up, D?

1276
01:30:51,863 --> 01:30:54,906
Yo, what's all that bullshit you pulled
in the mess hall, man?

1277
01:30:55,533 --> 01:30:58,285
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Are you fucking crazy?

1278
01:30:59,495 --> 01:31:01,621
D! Look at me, man!

1279
01:31:01,789 --> 01:31:03,206
You can't make it on your own.

1280
01:31:03,374 --> 01:31:07,335
I'm not afraid of those fucking pussies.
There was six of them, they jumped me.

1281
01:31:07,503 --> 01:31:09,963
That won't happen again.
I hope they fucking try.

1282
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:12,674
Look, I'm not talking about
your peckerwood friends!

1283
01:31:12,842 --> 01:31:15,051
They were protecting your stupid ass!

1284
01:31:15,219 --> 01:31:17,053
You dissed them in public.

1285
01:31:17,221 --> 01:31:19,264
Now you're on your fucking own!

1286
01:31:19,432 --> 01:31:21,641
Yo, man, I'm talking about the brothers.

1287
01:31:21,809 --> 01:31:25,479
They're gonna fuck you, toss your salad,
then smoke your motherfucking ass!

1288
01:31:25,646 --> 01:31:29,566
Tell me something I don't already know.
You think I haven't thought about that?

1289
01:31:29,734 --> 01:31:32,861
They're gonna come for me,
they're gonna come. Nothing I can do.

1290
01:31:35,239 --> 01:31:37,282
What can I do, man?

1291
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:43,747
So I was right back where I started.

1292
01:31:43,915 --> 01:31:45,665
Every day, I was sure it was my day.

1293
01:31:47,543 --> 01:31:49,961
Every time I stepped out of my cell.

1294
01:31:50,129 --> 01:31:52,589
Every time I got in that shower.

1295
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:59,554
I figured it was only a matter of time
before they made a move.

1296
01:32:01,265 --> 01:32:03,642
I just hoped that it'd be quick.

1297
01:32:35,299 --> 01:32:37,342
But it never came.

1298
01:32:38,761 --> 01:32:41,888
I couldn't figure it out.
I knew some of them were itching for it.

1299
01:32:42,056 --> 01:32:44,474
But after a while
I just put my head down...

1300
01:32:44,642 --> 01:32:47,978
...read the stuff that Sweeney sent me,
and I kept to myself.

1301
01:32:50,648 --> 01:32:53,275
The last six months in that place
I was like a ghost.

1302
01:33:07,832 --> 01:33:09,583
What's up, man? You getting out?

1303
01:33:12,878 --> 01:33:15,672
What the fuck you waiting on?
Get the fuck on out of here.

1304
01:33:18,134 --> 01:33:21,469
- Yeah, you know, I got this funny feeling.
- Oh, yeah? What's that?

1305
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:27,767
I'm thinking maybe the only reason
I'm getting out of here in one piece is you.

1306
01:33:27,935 --> 01:33:29,978
Come on, man.
Get the fuck out of here, man!

1307
01:33:30,146 --> 01:33:33,607
You think I'm gonna put my neck on the line
for a crazy-ass peckerwood?

1308
01:33:34,525 --> 01:33:37,694
Yeah. Right. Stupid.

1309
01:33:43,576 --> 01:33:45,368
That's what I thought.

1310
01:33:49,582 --> 01:33:51,541
I owe you, man.

1311
01:33:52,376 --> 01:33:54,711
Man, you don't owe me shit, all right?

1312
01:33:57,048 --> 01:33:58,923
Yes, I do.

1313
01:34:08,851 --> 01:34:10,185
You'll be out in no time.

1314
01:34:10,353 --> 01:34:12,479
Come on, man.
It's a piece of cake. All right?

1315
01:34:14,774 --> 01:34:17,692
You just take it easy on the brothers,
all right? The brothers!

1316
01:34:28,287 --> 01:34:30,246
God, man.

1317
01:34:32,124 --> 01:34:34,417
I'm sorry, Der.

1318
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:37,212
Sorry that happened to you.

1319
01:34:38,255 --> 01:34:41,383
No, I'm not. I'm lucky.

1320
01:34:41,550 --> 01:34:43,134
I feel lucky because...

1321
01:34:43,302 --> 01:34:45,220
...it's wrong, Dan.

1322
01:34:46,972 --> 01:34:50,934
It's wrong and it was eating me up.
It was gonna kill me.

1323
01:34:51,102 --> 01:34:53,812
And I kept asking myself all the time...

1324
01:34:53,979 --> 01:34:56,940
...how did I buy into this shit,
you know?

1325
01:34:58,609 --> 01:35:00,860
And it's just because I was pissed off.

1326
01:35:01,362 --> 01:35:05,156
And nothing I ever did
ever took that feeling away.

1327
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:08,952
I mean, I killed two guys, Danny.
I killed them.

1328
01:35:11,288 --> 01:35:13,707
And that didn't make me
feel any different.

1329
01:35:14,625 --> 01:35:18,086
It just got me more lost.
And I'm tired of feeling pissed off, Danny.

1330
01:35:18,963 --> 01:35:20,630
I'm just tired of it.

1331
01:35:21,966 --> 01:35:24,134
And I'm not telling you what to do.

1332
01:35:24,969 --> 01:35:26,636
I'm really not.

1333
01:35:27,471 --> 01:35:29,639
But I need you to understand.

1334
01:35:31,225 --> 01:35:33,977
Because I love you
and you're my best friend.

1335
01:35:36,772 --> 01:35:38,565
Do you understand?

1336
01:35:38,733 --> 01:35:40,692
Yeah, I understand.

1337
01:35:44,447 --> 01:35:45,822
All right.

1338
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:49,325
Whoo!

1339
01:35:49,493 --> 01:35:51,202
Jesus.

1340
01:36:06,093 --> 01:36:08,470
- Hey.
- Hi.

1341
01:36:08,637 --> 01:36:10,930
- Everything okay?
No, everything's great.

1342
01:36:11,098 --> 01:36:13,683
Great. Yeah.
You wanna sleep in our room?

1343
01:36:13,851 --> 01:36:17,145
- No, thank you. Yeah. This is good. I'm fine.
- You sure?

1344
01:36:17,938 --> 01:36:19,481
Thank you, though.

1345
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:21,941
All right. Come on, let's go.

1346
01:36:42,838 --> 01:36:44,380
Good night.

1347
01:37:51,448 --> 01:37:53,199
I'm gonna take a shower, all right?

1348
01:38:26,901 --> 01:38:31,321
It's hard to look back
and see the truth about people you love.

1349
01:38:31,488 --> 01:38:35,658
I think if you asked Derek why it all went
the way it did, and where it all started...

1350
01:38:35,826 --> 01:38:38,494
...he'd still say it started
when our father was murdered.

1351
01:38:39,622 --> 01:38:41,956
But the truth is, it started earlier.

1352
01:38:42,374 --> 01:38:45,251
All right. Are we all meeting together
for the game tonight?

1353
01:38:45,419 --> 01:38:46,753
Yes, definitely.

1354
01:38:46,921 --> 01:38:49,547
Ben's Burgers, 7:00,
then we go watch the big guy play.

1355
01:38:49,715 --> 01:38:51,925
Okay. Yeah.

1356
01:38:52,092 --> 01:38:55,511
- Psyching up for the game?
- Yeah, I'm always ready for that.

1357
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:59,682
I got an English exam third period.
I'm having a heart attack. I'm not ready.

1358
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:02,477
What's the matter,
afraid you're gonna get a B?

1359
01:39:02,645 --> 01:39:04,479
Might do you good. B minus.

1360
01:39:05,606 --> 01:39:07,357
Don't laugh. This guy is different.

1361
01:39:07,524 --> 01:39:11,986
Dr. Sweeney? This guy's unbelievable.
I've never had a teacher like this.

1362
01:39:12,154 --> 01:39:14,948
He's got two Ph. D.s.
I don't know what he's doing at our school.

1363
01:39:15,115 --> 01:39:18,201
- He's not like other teachers.
- What's he got you reading?

1364
01:39:19,495 --> 01:39:21,871
We got this essay exam on this book,
Native Son.

1365
01:39:22,039 --> 01:39:24,540
- All on this one book.
- Native Son. I don't know that.

1366
01:39:24,708 --> 01:39:25,959
That's a big surprise.

1367
01:39:27,544 --> 01:39:29,796
What? I read.

1368
01:39:29,964 --> 01:39:33,049
Honey, they don't teach
Tom Clancy at school.

1369
01:39:34,969 --> 01:39:36,719
Well, they don't.

1370
01:39:36,887 --> 01:39:39,263
So, what is it? What is this Native Son?
What is it?

1371
01:39:39,431 --> 01:39:41,557
It's this book about this black guy.

1372
01:39:42,142 --> 01:39:44,560
We're doing this
whole black literature unit.

1373
01:39:45,354 --> 01:39:47,021
What is it, Black History Month?

1374
01:39:47,398 --> 01:39:48,606
No, it's just like...

1375
01:39:48,774 --> 01:39:51,401
This guy Sweeney, you know,
it's part of the course now.

1376
01:39:54,697 --> 01:39:56,364
Yeah.

1377
01:39:58,409 --> 01:39:59,659
What?

1378
01:40:00,619 --> 01:40:02,495
Nothing. It's just, you know.

1379
01:40:02,663 --> 01:40:04,539
It's everywhere I look now.

1380
01:40:05,624 --> 01:40:06,916
What?

1381
01:40:08,335 --> 01:40:10,878
This affirmative blaction.

1382
01:40:11,922 --> 01:40:15,842
Honey, a few new books
doesn't qualify as affirmative black action.

1383
01:40:17,094 --> 01:40:18,761
Read the book, ace the guy's test.

1384
01:40:18,929 --> 01:40:21,264
Just don't swallow everything
he feeds you whole.

1385
01:40:21,432 --> 01:40:23,933
- Just because you see it on the news.
- But like what?

1386
01:40:24,101 --> 01:40:27,437
All this stuff about making everything equal.
It's not that simple.

1387
01:40:27,604 --> 01:40:29,313
Now you got this book, Native Son.

1388
01:40:29,481 --> 01:40:31,607
What happened to the other books
in the course?

1389
01:40:31,775 --> 01:40:35,820
They're not any good anymore because
Mr. Two-Ph. D. S says they aren't?

1390
01:40:35,988 --> 01:40:39,949
Are you gonna trade in great books
for black books? Does that make sense?

1391
01:40:41,326 --> 01:40:43,202
You gotta question these things, Derek.

1392
01:40:43,370 --> 01:40:45,371
You gotta look at the whole picture.

1393
01:40:45,539 --> 01:40:48,624
We're talking about books here.
But I'm also talking about my job.

1394
01:40:49,043 --> 01:40:52,336
I got two black guys on my squad now
who got their job...

1395
01:40:52,504 --> 01:40:56,132
...over a couple of white guys
who actually scored higher on the test.

1396
01:40:57,426 --> 01:41:01,137
That make sense? Huh?
Yeah, sure, everything's equal now...

1397
01:41:01,305 --> 01:41:05,558
...but I got two guys watching my back,
responsible for my life...

1398
01:41:05,726 --> 01:41:09,395
...who aren't as good as two others.
They got the job because they were black.

1399
01:41:09,563 --> 01:41:12,356
- Not because they were the best.
- That sucks.

1400
01:41:12,524 --> 01:41:14,442
Yeah. Is that what America is about?

1401
01:41:14,610 --> 01:41:16,736
No. America's about
"best man for the job. "

1402
01:41:16,904 --> 01:41:18,988
You do your best, you get the job.

1403
01:41:19,156 --> 01:41:22,450
You know, this affirmative action crap...

1404
01:41:22,618 --> 01:41:24,869
I don't know what that's about.
There's some...

1405
01:41:25,037 --> 01:41:27,663
...hidden agenda or something going on.

1406
01:41:27,831 --> 01:41:29,916
- You see what I'm saying?
- Yeah, I do.

1407
01:41:30,084 --> 01:41:32,502
I don't know,
I didn't think about it like that.

1408
01:41:32,669 --> 01:41:35,046
- Well...
- This guy, though...

1409
01:41:35,214 --> 01:41:38,132
I don't know. Dr. Sweeney,
he comes on, like, so strong...

1410
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:40,510
...it's kind of hard not to listen to him.

1411
01:41:40,677 --> 01:41:42,637
Maybe some of what he says is kind of...

1412
01:41:42,805 --> 01:41:44,430
It's bullshit.

1413
01:41:44,598 --> 01:41:46,849
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

1414
01:41:47,017 --> 01:41:48,601
No, no.

1415
01:41:48,769 --> 01:41:51,270
It's nigger bullshit.

1416
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:55,691
- You see that, don't you?
- Yeah.

1417
01:41:56,527 --> 01:42:00,530
- You gotta watch out for that.
- Yeah, I get what you're saying. I will.

1418
01:42:02,407 --> 01:42:03,866
Good boy.

1419
01:42:05,160 --> 01:42:08,329
- I'm proud of you.
- Don't worry about it. I got it.

1420
01:44:12,079 --> 01:44:13,496
It's 5:40 a. M...

1421
01:44:13,664 --> 01:44:18,084
...and in about one minute,
I'm gonna watch the sun come up.

1422
01:44:18,335 --> 01:44:20,628
I don't know if I've ever done that.

1423
01:44:21,630 --> 01:44:25,174
Anyway, we're gonna try
to pick things up and start over.

1424
01:44:25,342 --> 01:44:28,302
It won't be easy,
but we're all together again.

1425
01:44:29,179 --> 01:44:31,264
And I feel good.

1426
01:44:32,474 --> 01:44:34,809
I'm not sure if this paper
is what you wanted.

1427
01:44:34,977 --> 01:44:38,771
If I hit the social significance,
or whatever you're looking for.

1428
01:44:39,189 --> 01:44:43,234
But, for what it's worth, thanks a lot.

1429
01:44:57,541 --> 01:44:59,959
Wow. You look great.

1430
01:45:00,127 --> 01:45:01,961
Look at you.

1431
01:45:02,796 --> 01:45:05,715
Yeah. Gotta dress up
for the parole officer.

1432
01:45:06,216 --> 01:45:07,633
Is she cute?

1433
01:45:07,801 --> 01:45:10,386
She is a fat guy named Hector.

1434
01:45:10,554 --> 01:45:12,513
So I'm out of luck.

1435
01:45:15,517 --> 01:45:18,644
I just gotta check in,
then I'll see about getting my old job back.

1436
01:45:19,313 --> 01:45:20,563
Great.

1437
01:45:20,731 --> 01:45:22,732
- Good morning.
Yes, my love.

1438
01:45:22,899 --> 01:45:26,777
Davina, can you...?
Your sister's gonna help you, honey.

1439
01:45:26,945 --> 01:45:28,863
You look great. Knock them dead.
- Okay.

1440
01:45:29,031 --> 01:45:30,323
Thanks.

1441
01:45:30,574 --> 01:45:34,869
What would you like to wear?
I wanna wear my blue dress today.

1442
01:45:35,037 --> 01:45:38,164
- You do look good.
- Yeah? I feel silly.

1443
01:45:38,332 --> 01:45:40,416
- You look good.
Yeah?

1444
01:45:42,836 --> 01:45:44,337
You feel good?

1445
01:45:47,090 --> 01:45:50,176
Yeah. Yeah. I feel, you know...

1446
01:45:50,344 --> 01:45:52,428
...a little...

1447
01:45:52,596 --> 01:45:54,430
I'm getting there. I'm getting there.

1448
01:45:56,266 --> 01:45:59,393
Listen, I don't know...

1449
01:45:59,561 --> 01:46:02,396
I don't know if it's okay that I'm here.

1450
01:46:06,151 --> 01:46:08,402
I wanna be here.

1451
01:46:26,296 --> 01:46:27,755
- I'm gonna get a paper.
- Cool.

1452
01:46:45,399 --> 01:46:48,025
- What do you want?
- A maple bar and a large milk.

1453
01:46:48,193 --> 01:46:49,860
All right, I got it.

1454
01:46:54,866 --> 01:46:58,536
Let me get a coffee, a maple bar
and a large milk to go.

1455
01:46:58,703 --> 01:47:00,162
Right away.

1456
01:47:08,296 --> 01:47:10,131
Hey, Derek.
- Hey.

1457
01:47:11,133 --> 01:47:12,341
Derek.

1458
01:47:12,509 --> 01:47:15,010
- We need to talk.
- What's going on?

1459
01:47:15,178 --> 01:47:19,056
Cameron Alexander and Seth Ryan
are at the ICU at St. John's.

1460
01:47:19,224 --> 01:47:21,475
- They were jumped last night.
- How bad?

1461
01:47:21,643 --> 01:47:23,894
Well, it looks like they're gonna live.

1462
01:47:24,062 --> 01:47:27,148
- Then they got lucky.
- Somebody's gotta lose, though.

1463
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:32,069
Aw, what?

1464
01:47:32,237 --> 01:47:35,364
We were kind of hoping that maybe
you'd talk to your old crew.

1465
01:47:35,532 --> 01:47:37,700
- Come on. No way.
This is not a good thing.

1466
01:47:37,868 --> 01:47:40,035
If there's anybody they'll listen to,
it's you.

1467
01:47:40,203 --> 01:47:42,455
No. No, I hate to tell you, but I'm out.

1468
01:47:42,622 --> 01:47:44,665
Those guys are probably
gunning for me now.

1469
01:47:44,833 --> 01:47:46,709
We're asking for your help here, Derek.

1470
01:47:46,877 --> 01:47:49,336
- Did you tell him I was gonna do this?
- Derek.

1471
01:47:55,552 --> 01:47:57,219
This has got nothing to do with me.

1472
01:47:57,387 --> 01:48:00,181
Yes, it does.
It has everything to do with you.

1473
01:48:00,348 --> 01:48:03,058
What are you doing to me?
You know, I'm doing my best.

1474
01:48:03,226 --> 01:48:05,728
I'm going like this to keep
my family in the clear.

1475
01:48:05,896 --> 01:48:08,355
- Don't ask me to fix this.
- I'm not asking that.

1476
01:48:08,523 --> 01:48:12,443
- It was there before me.
- You helped create it. Wanna take a break?

1477
01:48:12,611 --> 01:48:14,862
You take a break, you'll find no peace.

1478
01:48:15,030 --> 01:48:17,406
The way to find peace is to stick.

1479
01:48:18,241 --> 01:48:20,576
It's not gonna make
a fucking bit of difference.

1480
01:48:20,744 --> 01:48:22,286
It might.

1481
01:48:23,705 --> 01:48:26,081
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
Do you?

1482
01:48:26,249 --> 01:48:29,335
Yes. I'm asking you to do
whatever is in your power to do.

1483
01:48:32,422 --> 01:48:33,756
Man.

1484
01:48:35,717 --> 01:48:37,218
Fuck.

1485
01:48:42,182 --> 01:48:43,766
All right.

1486
01:48:45,936 --> 01:48:47,895
You're gonna get me shot by white boys.

1487
01:48:48,063 --> 01:48:50,773
- I doubt it.
- Yeah, well...

1488
01:48:50,941 --> 01:48:54,318
...we're all gonna have a laugh at that,
let me tell you.

1489
01:48:54,486 --> 01:48:57,738
I'm gonna take him to school.
I'll be back in half an hour.

1490
01:48:57,906 --> 01:48:59,281
Come on.

1491
01:48:59,449 --> 01:49:02,743
Hey, you. You got
something good for me this morning?

1492
01:49:02,911 --> 01:49:06,455
- I'll give it to you, Dr. Sweeney. All right?
- Yeah, okay.

1493
01:49:10,794 --> 01:49:12,294
What's going on?

1494
01:49:17,801 --> 01:49:19,260
Come on.

1495
01:49:35,151 --> 01:49:38,153
This is so bad for Seth, man.

1496
01:49:38,321 --> 01:49:41,490
- I wonder how bad they got fucked up.
- I don't know.

1497
01:49:41,658 --> 01:49:44,660
I'm glad they're not dead,
but other than that, I don't care.

1498
01:49:45,495 --> 01:49:46,787
Should we visit them?

1499
01:49:46,955 --> 01:49:49,081
Visit them? No. No, definitely not.

1500
01:49:49,249 --> 01:49:51,584
Definitely not. Just stay out of it.

1501
01:49:51,751 --> 01:49:53,544
Listen, too...

1502
01:49:53,712 --> 01:49:57,756
...I saw a car cruising by the house last
night when I pulled out of there with Seth.

1503
01:49:57,924 --> 01:50:00,718
If you get home before me,
look around the street, all right?

1504
01:50:00,885 --> 01:50:02,845
Make sure there's nothing going on.

1505
01:50:04,264 --> 01:50:06,140
Oh, man. This is bad.

1506
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:11,437
- They're after you, man.
- It'll cool off.

1507
01:50:11,605 --> 01:50:13,272
If I made it through Chino...

1508
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:17,026
...this should be a piece of cake, right?

1509
01:50:17,193 --> 01:50:20,362
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

1510
01:50:21,781 --> 01:50:23,198
Okay.

1511
01:50:23,783 --> 01:50:25,242
What are you gonna do?

1512
01:50:25,410 --> 01:50:27,161
I don't know. I'll work it out. Hey.

1513
01:50:27,329 --> 01:50:29,455
Keep your head up.
Things are gonna be fine.

1514
01:50:29,623 --> 01:50:31,457
It's gonna be fine.

1515
01:50:31,625 --> 01:50:33,334
Go turn that paper in.

1516
01:50:35,545 --> 01:50:38,213
- Okay. All right, see you.
- Hey, hey, Dan.

1517
01:50:46,056 --> 01:50:47,681
I'll see you at home.

1518
01:50:49,601 --> 01:50:51,185
All right?

1519
01:50:51,561 --> 01:50:52,811
Yeah, I'll see you.

1520
01:50:52,979 --> 01:50:55,147
- Hey, good luck, all right?
- Yeah.

1521
01:50:55,523 --> 01:50:57,066
See you later.

1522
01:51:02,989 --> 01:51:04,948
- We're gonna be late.
We'd better go.

1523
01:51:05,116 --> 01:51:07,701
- Okay.
- All right. Come on.

1524
01:51:30,767 --> 01:51:33,686
- Fine.
- All right. I'll catch up with you, all right?

1525
01:51:33,937 --> 01:51:35,479
See you later.

1526
01:52:56,060 --> 01:52:57,478
- Derek, no!
- Get out of my way!

1527
01:52:57,645 --> 01:52:59,730
- All right. All right.
- Get out of my way!

1528
01:52:59,898 --> 01:53:01,315
Let him go!

1529
01:53:02,984 --> 01:53:07,029
Oh, no. No! No! No!

1530
01:53:07,363 --> 01:53:09,531
Oh, Jesus.

1531
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:14,036
No.

1532
01:53:14,204 --> 01:53:18,373
Oh, no, no. No.

1533
01:53:32,931 --> 01:53:34,640
Oh, Jesus.

1534
01:53:34,808 --> 01:53:36,975
God, what did I do?

1535
01:53:50,365 --> 01:53:54,827
Oh, God.

1536
01:54:05,755 --> 01:54:08,382
So I guess this is where
I tell you what I learned.

1537
01:54:08,550 --> 01:54:10,926
My conclusion, right?

1538
01:54:11,761 --> 01:54:13,846
Well, my conclusion is...

1539
01:54:14,013 --> 01:54:16,014
...hate is baggage.

1540
01:54:16,266 --> 01:54:19,560
Life's too short
to be pissed off all the time.

1541
01:54:20,103 --> 01:54:21,979
It's just not worth it.

1542
01:54:24,774 --> 01:54:27,901
Derek says it's always good
to end a paper with a quote.

1543
01:54:28,403 --> 01:54:30,445
He says someone else
has already said it best...

1544
01:54:30,613 --> 01:54:35,117
...so if you can't top it,
steal from them and go out strong.

1545
01:54:35,285 --> 01:54:37,953
So I picked a guy I thought you'd like:

1546
01:54:39,539 --> 01:54:42,916
"We are not enemies, but friends.

1547
01:54:43,084 --> 01:54:45,502
We must not be enemies.

1548
01:54:45,670 --> 01:54:47,880
Though passion may have strained...

1549
01:54:48,047 --> 01:54:51,300
...it must not break
our bonds of affection.

1550
01:54:51,467 --> 01:54:56,305
The mystic chords of memory
will swell when again touched...

1551
01:54:56,472 --> 01:55:01,101
...as surely they will be,
by the better angels of our nature. "

1552
01:55:02,305 --> 01:55:08,813
