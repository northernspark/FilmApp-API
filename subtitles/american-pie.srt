2
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:32,074
Oh, you're so good.

3
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:35,410
Oh, yes.
I am the best, baby.

4
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:37,829
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, that was a tit.

5
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:40,332
That is a tit! Yes!

6
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,334
Oh, you're so big!

7
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:45,170
Oh, yeah.
That's right, baby.

8
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:47,464
Doggie wants
to hide his bone.

9
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,716
I'm bone smugglin', baby.

10
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,844
Man, would you shut up!

11
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:54,346
Hey, Jimmy.
Just wanted to say sweet dreams.

12
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,348
Sweet dreams.
Good night, Mom.

13
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,934
Kiss good night.

14
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:03,021
- Something wrong with the reception?
- Yeah. Yeah.

15
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:05,691
There's this nature show
that I'm trying to watch.

16
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,277
And the birds are
all scrambled and I can't even...

17
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,612
Do me! Yes!

18
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:12,698
Baby! Ride me like a pony!

19
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:16,201
The thing must be broken
or I sat on the remote or something.

20
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:18,704
- Getting ready for bed, son?
- I'm all set, Dad.

21
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,874
No, I think he's tried
to watch some illegal channels.

22
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,918
- lllegal channels?
- This is just bad reception, honey.

23
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:27,004
- Spank my hairy ass!
- What's that?

24
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,338
Oh, baby!

25
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,883
You know what?
Just give me this, please...

26
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:33,760
- Oh, my God!
- And let's get this...

27
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:37,556
Okay, okay. What the hell's
the matter with this thing?

28
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:38,974
Yes!

29
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,945
lllegal channels? Shit!

30
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:55,574
If there's any channel that should be
illegal, it's that all-woman's channel.

31
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:59,411
Lifetime supply
of pantihose or some shit.

32
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:02,789
Did you see The Little Mermaid
on TV the other night?

33
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:06,710
- Ariel, man, she's so hot!
- She's a mermaid, dude.

34
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,879
Yeah, Oz. But not when she's on land.

35
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:12,758
Come on, Vicky, it's Stifler's party.
We got to go. It'll be great.

36
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:17,679
All that happens at Stifler's parties
is people get drunk and do it.

37
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,599
Come on, Kevin. Open it.

38
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,936
It's a big, thick envelope,
Vicky. You got in.

39
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:26,188
If you think so,
just open it.

40
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,232
Fine.

41
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:38,909
"Dear Miss Latham: We're sorry but
after keeping you on the waiting list...

42
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:43,038
for the past couple of months, we've
decided that you are now rejected. "

43
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,958
- Shut up!
- You got in.

44
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,836
Yes! I love you!

45
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:01,139
You think I should wear
this shirt to Stifler's party?

46
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:03,767
You've worn that shirt for
three days in a row, man!

47
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,853
Guys, she said it.

48
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:08,313
- Said what?
- She said she loves me.

49
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:10,691
Holy shit, dude! The "L" word?

50
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,318
Cornell's not
that far from "U" of"M."

51
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:16,905
It's only, like, seven hours.
And you get to drive across Canada.

52
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:18,866
Beautiful country.

53
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:21,869
Whatever. It's doable.

54
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,496
What we should do today, in band...

55
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,417
instead of playing our instruments
regularly, we should play backwards.

56
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,878
- That'd be so funny!
- Yeah.

57
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:39,511
You're talking about a post-high school
long-distance relationship.

58
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:43,682
-And you and Kevin haven't even done it.
-That's not why we're going out.

59
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:47,352
What do you expect him to drive
to Cornell for? Milk and cookies?

60
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:49,605
We're gonna have sex
when he's ready and I'm ready.

61
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,773
It's got to be
completely perfect.

62
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:54,943
I want the right time,
the right moment, the right place...

63
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,779
Vicky, it's not
a space shuttle launch. It's sex.

64
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:04,786
- Finch.
- Here's the man we are looking for.

65
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,330
- What's goin' on, buddy?
- Same ol'...

66
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,168
Finch.
You got the Latin homework?

67
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:18,091
It means, "My dog ate it. "
It's Latin.

68
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:21,845
- It's a Latin joke.
- Latin. Just drink your coffee.

69
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:25,224
- No, Jim, it's mochaccino.
- What?

70
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,392
It's mochaccino.
It's not coffee.

71
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,603
'Nova!

72
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:33,857
- What's up, dude?
- Comin' to the party, you fuckface?

73
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:36,318
Depends if my date
wants to stop by.

74
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,571
- I'm workin' on somethin' new.
- I got an idea about something new.

75
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:41,990
How about you guys
actually locate your dicks...

76
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:44,910
remove the shrink-wrap
and fucking use them!

77
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:48,747
Dude, it's gonna happen.
She's a college chick.

78
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,250
Oh, right.
I'll see you guys tonight.

79
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:55,003
I'll look for you
in the no-fucking section.

80
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:02,302
I'm shooting for a 9:00 E.T.A.
Beer in hand by five after.

81
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:04,596
Breath check.

82
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,735
- I wish you wouldn't do that.
- You got something up your sleeve?

83
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,613
This is a foolproof plan,
my friend.

84
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:23,782
I have a serious question
to ask you guys.

85
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:27,494
You know Nadia the Czechoslovakian
chick? She might be there tonight.

86
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,788
Do you think she would prefer...

87
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,918
laid-back Jim, or...

88
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:38,922
cool, hip Jim?

89
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,426
I don't think it really matters
with that shirt you're wearing.

90
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,805
You're the one with the girlfriend,
and you're still stranded on third base.

91
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:49,850
Hey, at least I know
what third base feels like.

92
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:53,937
- You're still just a batboy.
- Batboy. What are you talking about?

93
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:57,024
Guys, uh...

94
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,360
What exactly does
third base feel like?

95
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:02,529
You wanna
take this one?

96
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:06,450
Like warm apple pie.

97
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,120
Apple pie, huh?

98
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:14,124
McDonald's or home-made?

99
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:17,836
Gentlemen, destiny awaits.

100
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,387
That's number five and six
for the Stif-meister!

101
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:34,228
Holy!

102
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,233
Nadia! Buenos dias.
Glad you could make it.

103
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,401
I'll be back for you later.

104
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:50,160
- Another party sultan!
- How ya doin'?

105
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:52,496
Welcome to Stifler's
Palace of Love, fellas.

106
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,541
The keg's back there! Enjoy!

107
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:59,670
Vicky, Jessica! Great to see you.
Glad you could make it.

108
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,547
Bitches!

109
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,382
- Sherman!
- Hey!

110
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:05,968
What the fuck
are you doin' here?

111
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:11,014
Fellas! What's goin' on?

112
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:15,686
Sherman. Not much.
Just scopin' the babes.

113
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:19,731
Indeed!
Some fine ladies here, boys.

114
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:22,943
Confidence is high.
Repeat. Confidence is high.

115
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,445
Sherman is movin'
to DEFCON 2.

116
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:28,866
Full strategic arsenal
ready for deployment.

117
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,076
You have somethin'
goin' tonight, Sherman?

118
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,245
You see that
Central chick, Bernette?

119
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,375
She's around.
Seems she's taken a liking to me.

120
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:43,172
It's time she experienced
the Shermanator.

121
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:45,549
Yeah, okay, Sherman.
Whatever.

122
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:49,678
I'm a sophisticated sex robot
sent back through time...

123
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:53,265
to change the future
for one lucky lady.

124
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,810
- Go get 'em, tiger.
- I'll be back!

125
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,939
- Hopeless.
- Completely.

126
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,066
- Hi.
- Hey, Vic.

127
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,028
Oh, shit.
Guys... Guys...

128
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:09,740
There's Nadia
and she just looked at me.

129
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,451
- She just looked at me.
- Why don't you go talk to her?

130
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,665
You're right, Kev.
I should just go talk to her.

131
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:22,794
I could do that.
Sure.

132
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:07,631
That's great!

133
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,772
See ya later.

134
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,490
We're here for the party.

135
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,744
What party? There's no party.

136
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:46,545
Weird.
Try the house down the street.

137
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:53,385
So, what's your major?

138
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,804
Post-modern feminist thought.

139
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:58,974
Oh, cool.
Great night, isn't it?

140
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,934
Sure.

141
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:07,733
Yeah, it's just somethin' about the
springtime that's just cool, you know?

142
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:11,195
Like the smell
of fresh rain or somethin'.

143
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:17,159
- Suck me, beautiful.
- What did you just say?

144
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,077
Suck me, beautiful.

145
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:26,251
My friends call me "'Nova,"
as in Casanova.

146
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:27,711
That's pathetic.

147
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,216
Jeez, you don't
have to laugh at me.

148
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,259
There's just some things
you need to learn.

149
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:36,637
- Like what?
- Well, you've got to tone it down.

150
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,931
You don't need to come
to a place like Lookout Point...

151
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:41,934
and spout off cheeseball lines
to be romantic.

152
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:45,521
- Okay.
- You have to pay attention to a girl.

153
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:49,483
Be sensitive to her feelings.
Relationships are reciprocal.

154
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:53,820
Come on, Casanova.
I'll take you back to your friends.

155
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:03,288
Vicky, think it's time to take
the next step in our relationship?

156
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:07,125
- Tonight?
- Yeah, it's such a perfect evening.

157
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:09,628
I mean, it's how you've
always pictured it, isn't it?

158
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,880
Damn, my farts fuckin' stink!

159
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:16,468
Dude, you gotta take a shit!
You smell like a Yeti!

160
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:18,095
Or not.

161
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:20,931
Just relax.

162
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,145
You actually said that?

163
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:30,816
Shut up!

164
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,985
You did a hell of a lot better
than I did with Nadia.

165
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:36,029
Oh, thanks, Jim, that's great.
That's really reassuring.

166
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:38,615
Hey, no problem, 'Nova.

167
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:42,619
Hey, don't call me 'Nova any more.
I'm a fraud.

168
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:45,122
You guys are pathetic.

169
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,291
I'm gonna find myself
a little hottie.

170
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:50,794
"Suck me, beautiful"!

171
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:59,428
- Let me know.
- Okay.

172
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:01,847
Keep going.

173
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,433
I should be able
to talk to girls.

174
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:06,852
I'm articulate.

175
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:09,188
You know, I got a 720
on my S.A.T. verbal.

176
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:11,481
Bullshit.
There's no way.

177
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:15,444
I kid you not, man.
Look. Listen.

178
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:17,696
Copious.

179
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,740
Verisimilitude.

180
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,076
Oh, now.

181
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,380
Suck me, beautiful!

182
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:38,258
- Damn it, Stifler.
- Checkout time!

183
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:41,386
Please, vacate the room.

184
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,597
You are such a jerk.

185
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:51,230
God, I can't believe how many
cool people are at this party.

186
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,944
And you got a keg too!

187
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:59,863
- Wow!
- Indeed.

188
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:08,080
Oh, wait.
I left my beer downstairs.

189
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:10,499
No. No.
Here, babe!

190
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:13,669
Thanks.

191
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:17,005
You're really beautiful. Oh...

192
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:20,342
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

193
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,985
You know what? I don't know
if I want to be doing this.

194
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:39,903
Doing what?

195
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:42,823
You know, if we hook up tonight...

196
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:45,868
tomorrow I'll just be some girl
you go telling your friends about.

197
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,204
No way!

198
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:53,208
Steve, you could at least look at me
when you say that!

199
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:54,334
Look.

200
00:13:55,627 --> 00:14:01,008
Sarah, I wouldn't go telling stories
or anything about you.

201
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:05,679
I promise.
So, just relax.

202
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:09,933
Take it slow,
and let the good times roll.

203
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:15,647
- Okay.
- All right.

204
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,406
What's wrong?

205
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:28,619
What's wrong?
What is it?

206
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:33,207
Xenophobic.

207
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:43,383
- Regurgitation.
- I know that one.

208
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:47,804
- Kevin likes it.
- He likes getting head.

209
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:50,390
Gee, what a total shocker.
What about you, Vicky?

210
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:52,643
I mean, have you just
never had one with Kevin...

211
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,686
or have you never
had one, period?

212
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:55,938
I've had one.

213
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:59,441
- I think.
- Okay.

214
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:03,320
That's a no. No wonder
you're not psyched about sex.

215
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,364
You never even had one manually?

216
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:08,700
-I've never tried it.
-You've never double-clicked your mouse?

217
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:12,579
Nice!

218
00:15:12,663 --> 00:15:14,665
Jesus! How much did you drink?

219
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:17,209
Hey, Stifler?

220
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:20,212
- How's the pale ale?
- Fuck you!

221
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,802
- That's Stifler's mom?
- Yup.

222
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:31,723
Shit. I cannot believe a fine woman
like this produced a guy like Stifler.

223
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:34,935
- Dude, that chick's a "MILF."
- What the hell is that?

224
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:39,106
M-I-L-F... Mom I'd like to fuck.

225
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:42,150
Yeah, dude!
Oh, yeah!

226
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:45,279
- Yeah! MILF!
- Hey, guys.

227
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:50,033
- Come here.
- Sherman, what's goin' on?

228
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:53,162
Don't you think you fellas
could try a little tact?

229
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:56,957
I got company,
if you know what I mean?

230
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:02,087
She's hot!

231
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:09,386
If Sherman has sex before I do,
I'm gonna be really pissed.

232
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,725
The Shermanator?

233
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:18,270
Come on, man.

234
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:21,857
MILF! MILF!

235
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:26,111
MILF! MILF! Hey, dude.
What are you doin' to her, dude?

236
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:29,573
Oh, my God, bro, dude.

237
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:34,495
Enough of this blow job bullshit.
I gotta get laid already.

238
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:37,456
That's nice.
Really, really nice.

239
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:40,792
- Can I have a ride?
- Sure.

240
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:43,504
- Vicky, wait.
- Not for you.

241
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:48,509
Yeti! I am the Yeti!

242
00:16:57,142 --> 00:17:00,479
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Finch, where were you last night?

243
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:02,856
What happened to that
foolproof plan of yours?

244
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,193
I was going for a fashionably late
entrance, and I was too late.

245
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,946
So, no ladies left.

246
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:11,573
It was a very
special night, very special.

247
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:14,743
Guys. Guys.

248
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:20,666
- I'll never forget this.
- I'll never forget it, either.

249
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:22,626
Thank you.

250
00:17:33,846 --> 00:17:37,015
Fellas, say goodbye
to Chuck Sherman, the boy.

251
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:39,810
I am now a man.

252
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,563
I highly recommend
you join the club.

253
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:45,983
We were doin' the wild thing
all night.

254
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,026
I'm exhausted.

255
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,113
I don't get it.
How the hell did you do that?

256
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:55,909
It was just my time.
It was just my time.

257
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:59,705
Best of luck to you boys.

258
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:05,210
- I cannot believe this.
- Come on, guys.

259
00:18:05,294 --> 00:18:07,129
We should be happy
for Sherman.

260
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:11,633
No, we shouldn't be.

261
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:14,553
You know, I put in months
of quality time with Vicky.

262
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:17,306
Sherman meets a chick
for one night and scores.

263
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:20,058
- This is just wrong.
- No shit.

264
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:23,645
How the hell am I supposed
to become Mr Sensitive Man?

265
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:27,399
We're all gonna go to college
as virgins. You realize this, right?

266
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:29,902
They probably have special dorms
for people like us.

267
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:34,740
All right. I got an idea.
But it's got to stay between us.

268
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:37,659
It's really simple. We just
got to make an agreement.

269
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:39,745
It's more than an agreement.

270
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:41,997
- A bet?
- A pact.

271
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,333
No money involved.
More important than any bet.

272
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:48,253
Here's the deal.
We all get laid before we graduate.

273
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,841
Dude, it's not like I haven't
been trying to get laid.

274
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:56,887
Think about when you work out, Oz.
You gotta have someone to spot you.

275
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,849
Someone to keep you motivated.
That's what we can do for each other.

276
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:03,602
We'll be there
to keep each other on track.

277
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:06,104
Separately we are flawed
and vulnerable, but together...

278
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:08,273
we are the masters
of our sexual destiny.

279
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:12,277
Their tiger-style kung fu is strong,
but our dragon-style will defeat it.

280
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:12,945
Guys!

281
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:15,822
The Shaolin masters from
East and West must unite!

282
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:18,450
- Fight, and find out who is number one.
- Guys!

283
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:23,372
Come on. You're ruining my moment here.
This is our very manhood at stake.

284
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:25,999
We must make a stand,
here and now.

285
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:30,796
No longer will our penises
remain flaccid and unused!

286
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:34,967
We will fight for every man out there
who isn't getting laid and should be.

287
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:38,554
This is our day.
This is our time.

288
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:42,933
And, by God, we will not stand by and
watch history condemn us into celibacy.

289
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,060
- Amen.
- I like that.

290
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:48,981
- We will make a stand. We will succeed.
- 'Bout time!

291
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:51,650
We will get laid!

292
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:54,862
The sex.

293
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:57,239
It's got to be valid,
consensual sex.

294
00:19:57,322 --> 00:20:00,659
No prostitutes.
That's what you're thinkin', Finch.

295
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:02,161
Busted.

296
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,998
So, basically,
prom is our last chance.

297
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:08,167
- Dude, prom sucks.
- I know.

298
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,335
But you gotta think
about it this way.

299
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:14,381
I mean, all the parties afterwards?
The chicks are going to want to do it.

300
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:17,467
He's right. It's like
tradition or something.

301
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:20,387
- Like the Rose Bowl.
- So, that gives us...

302
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,764
Exactly three weeks to the day.

303
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:27,186
- We're gonna do this.
- To the next step!

304
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:28,228
Next step!

305
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:21,114
Well, did you get the flowers?

306
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:51,687
You'll get her back soon enough.

307
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:54,022
- You think so?
- She likes you.

308
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:55,315
- I like her too.
- Do you love her?

309
00:21:57,526 --> 00:22:00,362
You know what?
You can't really ask me that.

310
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:03,365
If you want to get her in the sack,
just tell her you love her.

311
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:06,368
- That's how I was duped.
- Look, Jessica.

312
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:08,620
I don't want
to dupe her.

313
00:22:10,164 --> 00:22:14,293
All right. What you need to do
is learn how to press a girl's buttons.

314
00:22:14,376 --> 00:22:16,461
You have to give her
what she's never had.

315
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:19,965
- What's that?
- Let me give you a hint.

316
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:27,264
Comprende?
- You mean an orgasm.

317
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:28,765
You got it, stud.

318
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:31,810
Well, I'm pretty sure
that I've given her a...

319
00:22:31,894 --> 00:22:35,814
- No, you haven't.
- Well, there was one time...

320
00:22:35,898 --> 00:22:38,817
- No.
- Oh, man.

321
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:43,363
Look, kid, it's up to you.
The big "L" or the big "O."

322
00:22:43,614 --> 00:22:46,742
Dickhead!
You gotta see this.

323
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:50,913
Do you believe in magic
In a young girl's heart

324
00:22:50,996 --> 00:22:54,500
How the music can free her
whenever it starts

325
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:59,004
And it's magic if the music is groovy
It makes you feel...

326
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:01,590
What did you cocks do to him?

327
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:04,468
I'll tell you about the magic
It'll free your soul

328
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:08,889
But it's like tryin'to tell
a stranger 'bout rock 'n'roll

329
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:11,141
Great.
See you next time.

330
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:18,941
Hey, guys.
Came to watch me in action?

331
00:23:19,024 --> 00:23:21,693
- I think you sounded pretty good.
- Yeah, man.

332
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:23,612
I think you need
your balls reattached.

333
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:27,282
- Hey, keep it down, dude.
- What the fuck are you doing here?

334
00:23:27,366 --> 00:23:29,409
This place
is an untapped resource.

335
00:23:29,493 --> 00:23:33,288
I mean, check it out.
These vocal jazz girls are hot.

336
00:23:33,372 --> 00:23:36,124
Why the hell is he joining
jazz choir so late?

337
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:39,962
Maybe he's preparing for
another senior year at East?

338
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:42,714
You guys,
we don't even know him.

339
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:47,970
You dipshit!

340
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:52,182
You're expecting to score with some
goody-goody choirgirl priss?

341
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:56,311
These chicks don't know me. I can work
the sensitive angle here, fellas!

342
00:23:56,395 --> 00:23:58,605
You know, it's just like
that college chick told me.

343
00:23:58,689 --> 00:24:01,733
All that you gotta do
is just ask 'em questions...

344
00:24:01,817 --> 00:24:03,777
and listen to what
they have to say and shit.

345
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:08,198
I don't know, man.
That sounds like a lot of work!

346
00:24:11,577 --> 00:24:13,412
Just a second!

347
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,752
Come in. Come in.

348
00:24:20,836 --> 00:24:23,130
Oh, Jim, you're here.

349
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:26,592
I was just walking
by your room and...

350
00:24:26,675 --> 00:24:30,721
And, you know, I was thinking, "Boy,
it's been a long time since we've had...

351
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:33,223
a little father-son chat. "

352
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:38,687
Oh! I almost forgot.
I bought some magazines.

353
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:41,982
Do you just want to flip
to the centre section?

354
00:24:44,193 --> 00:24:46,778
Well, this is the...
this is the female form.

355
00:24:46,862 --> 00:24:49,781
And they have
focused on the breasts...

356
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:54,620
which are used primarily
to feed young infants...

357
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:58,290
and also in foreplay.

358
00:24:58,373 --> 00:24:59,416
Right.

359
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,794
This is...
This is Hustler.

360
00:25:02,878 --> 00:25:06,590
And this is a much
more exotic magazine.

361
00:25:06,673 --> 00:25:11,470
Now, they have decided to focus
more on the pubic region...

362
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:15,390
- Right.
- The whole groin area.

363
00:25:15,474 --> 00:25:19,269
Look at the expression on her face.
You see that? See what's she's doing?

364
00:25:19,353 --> 00:25:22,731
She's kind of looking
right into your eyes saying...

365
00:25:22,814 --> 00:25:26,318
"Hey, big boy.
Hey, how ya doin'?"

366
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:28,695
- You see?
- Right.

367
00:25:30,948 --> 00:25:34,326
Shaved is a magazine
I'm not too familiar with...

368
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:39,081
but, again,
if you flip to the centre...

369
00:25:39,164 --> 00:25:41,166
section...

370
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:45,796
Well, you see the detail that
they go into in this picture here.

371
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:51,009
It almost looks like a tropical plant
or something, underwater thing.

372
00:25:51,093 --> 00:25:53,679
- Do you know what a clitoris is?
- Oh, my God.

373
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:56,139
- Don't say, "Oh... "
- I know what a clitoris is.

374
00:25:56,223 --> 00:25:58,517
You've been there and back.
You know everything.

375
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:03,230
I've learned about it in Sex Ed.
I don't need you to talk about clitoris.

376
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:05,983
You know what?
I'm sorry, okay?

377
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:09,486
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

378
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:13,282
I shouldn't have got hot there.
You know what I'm going to do, Jim?

379
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:15,826
I'm going to just
leave these books here...

380
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:19,371
for you to peruse at your...
at your leisure.

381
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:21,999
Wait!

382
00:26:27,296 --> 00:26:29,381
Well, safer than a tube sock.

383
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,387
- Okay, that was good.
- Yeah.

384
00:26:37,347 --> 00:26:40,934
- See you at dinner.
- Yeah. I'll see you at dinner.

385
00:26:41,727 --> 00:26:43,687
So, Finch, this is your plan?

386
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:47,149
You know, I don't think girls are
into the whole mini-golf thing.

387
00:26:47,232 --> 00:26:49,359
Kevin, I'm sure
that they're not.

388
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:53,113
Actually, there is one small matter that
I need to ask for your cooperation in...

389
00:26:53,197 --> 00:26:56,200
- in the spirit of this pact.
- What do you need?

390
00:26:56,283 --> 00:26:59,411
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
And tell all the boys the same thing.

391
00:26:59,495 --> 00:27:03,373
Look, I gotta go.
Sixteen minutes round-trip.

392
00:27:03,457 --> 00:27:06,251
You know, Finch,
it's senior year.

393
00:27:06,335 --> 00:27:08,670
Don't you think it's time you learned
how to take a dump at school?

394
00:27:08,754 --> 00:27:12,090
When was the last time you looked
at the facilities in this school?

395
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:23,310
Excuse me.
That's Paul Finch, right?

396
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:26,688
You've seen him
in the locker room, right?

397
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:31,818
My friends, they want
to know: Is it true?

398
00:27:31,902 --> 00:27:34,613
You know, that he's equipped.

399
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:38,784
I have no idea. Finch showers
with his bathing suit on.

400
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:41,286
I mean...

401
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:44,623
As a matter of fact, it is true.
The guy's huge!

402
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:47,876
- Does he have a date for the prom yet?
- No, definitely not.

403
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,962
All right. Thanks.

404
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:53,757
Oh, man!

405
00:27:54,216 --> 00:27:58,929
So I was thinking maybe you could give
me some advice, brother to brother.

406
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:02,182
I thought you might know a trick
or somethin'to make her...

407
00:28:02,266 --> 00:28:03,308
Orgasm?

408
00:28:03,392 --> 00:28:06,228
- Yeah.
- What's good here?

409
00:28:06,311 --> 00:28:08,522
- Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
- What?

410
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:10,023
How do you do that?

411
00:28:10,107 --> 00:28:12,401
Never mind that.
Pay attention.

412
00:28:12,484 --> 00:28:15,821
Is that all that you're interested in,
tryin' to get your girl into bed?

413
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:19,074
It'd be good to be able to,
you know, return the favour.

414
00:28:19,158 --> 00:28:21,577
Be nice to know she enjoys
things as much as I do.

415
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,913
Good. That's what I wanted to hear.
Now you qualify.

416
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:28,750
- Qualify for what?
- You've just inherited the Bible.

417
00:28:31,962 --> 00:28:34,047
It originally started
as a sex manual...

418
00:28:34,131 --> 00:28:37,509
this book that some guys
brought back from Amsterdam.

419
00:28:37,593 --> 00:28:40,262
Each year it got passed on
to one East student who was worthy.

420
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:44,474
Now, it's full of all sorts of stuff
that guys have added over the years.

421
00:28:46,894 --> 00:28:52,149
But you have to keep it a secret
and return it at the end of the year.

422
00:28:52,232 --> 00:28:55,152
So now you know. Good luck.

423
00:29:02,618 --> 00:29:04,870
- If you believe in magic
- Magic

424
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:06,830
Don't you bother to choose

425
00:29:06,914 --> 00:29:10,083
If it's jug band music
or rhythm and blues

426
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:13,504
Just go and listen
It will start with a smile

427
00:29:13,587 --> 00:29:17,508
That won't wipe off your face
no matter how hard you try

428
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:20,469
Your feet start tappin'
And you can't seem to find

429
00:29:20,552 --> 00:29:22,971
How you got there

430
00:29:23,055 --> 00:29:25,724
Do you believe in magic

431
00:29:30,896 --> 00:29:33,232
Yeah, magic

432
00:29:33,315 --> 00:29:35,567
What was that?

433
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:38,237
- Sorry.
- No, it was good.

434
00:29:40,656 --> 00:29:44,076
Well, it...
It came from the heart.

435
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,163
Keep it coming.
All right, people, good work.

436
00:29:48,247 --> 00:29:53,418
Don't forget. The state competition's
a couple of weeks away, so keep on it.

437
00:30:04,012 --> 00:30:07,808
- Not bad, Chris.
- Really?

438
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:12,437
Thanks.
Heather, right?

439
00:30:13,981 --> 00:30:16,942
You've got this sort of
Frank Sinatra thing going on.

440
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:21,697
Right. I feel like I've discovered
this whole new side of me.

441
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,324
I mean, music is so expressive.

442
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:28,912
Okay, I agree, but aren't
you supposed to be out...

443
00:30:28,996 --> 00:30:32,749
trying to decapitate someone
with your lacrosse stick or something?

444
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:36,795
Oh, sure, sure. You know,
I know what people think.

445
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:40,507
It's like, "Oz, he's just this
kick-ass lacrosse player. "

446
00:30:40,591 --> 00:30:44,887
I also play football, by the way,
but that's not all that I am, you know?

447
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,763
Of course, I didn't...

448
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:51,310
It really bothers me when people
try to pigeonhole me like that.

449
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:55,731
You? You think
I don't get that?

450
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:59,151
God, it's like just because I don't
get drunk and barf every weekend...

451
00:30:59,234 --> 00:31:03,572
that people say, "Look, there's this
Goody Two-Shoes choirgirl priss. "

452
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:07,951
Yeah. So, like,
what else do you do?

453
00:31:08,744 --> 00:31:11,455
Well, the same things you do...

454
00:31:11,538 --> 00:31:14,416
like hang out
with friends and stuff.

455
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,835
Why? What do you think I do?

456
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:21,298
I just realized that I don't know
anything about you. I was interested.

457
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:25,219
What do you want to know?

458
00:31:25,302 --> 00:31:28,096
You know, stuff about you.

459
00:31:31,016 --> 00:31:33,060
All right.

460
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:37,606
Mom, I'm home!

461
00:32:34,663 --> 00:32:36,331
Oh, yeah.

462
00:32:41,837 --> 00:32:44,173
It's not what it looks like.

463
00:32:50,512 --> 00:32:53,182
Well, we'll just tell
your mother that...

464
00:32:53,265 --> 00:32:55,267
that we ate it all.

465
00:33:35,307 --> 00:33:37,809
Goal by number eight,
Chris Ostreicher.

466
00:33:41,647 --> 00:33:43,774
- Nice game.
- Good game.

467
00:33:47,486 --> 00:33:50,447
Hey, what are
you doin' here?

468
00:33:50,531 --> 00:33:53,951
Just enjoying my first exhilarating
lacrosse experience.

469
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:56,578
- You kicked butt.
- Oh, thanks.

470
00:33:56,662 --> 00:33:59,748
- Chris...
- You can call me Oz.

471
00:33:59,832 --> 00:34:02,209
- Do I have to?
- You can call me Ostreicher.

472
00:34:02,292 --> 00:34:04,336
- What's your middle name?
- Forget it.

473
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:08,048
- I won't tell anyone.
- Well, neither will I.

474
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,264
So, I had this thought and...

475
00:34:15,347 --> 00:34:17,683
It may seem like
it's way out of left field.

476
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:19,768
I don't know if you can...

477
00:34:19,852 --> 00:34:22,271
but since I'm not going with
anybody, I thought that maybe...

478
00:34:22,354 --> 00:34:25,023
Those guys sucked ass!

479
00:34:25,107 --> 00:34:27,359
Choir chick, what the hell
are you doing here?

480
00:34:28,277 --> 00:34:32,239
Well, I was asking
Chris to prom.

481
00:34:32,322 --> 00:34:34,199
So, do you want to go?

482
00:34:34,283 --> 00:34:37,828
Oh, yeah!
That would be great.

483
00:34:38,704 --> 00:34:41,039
Just don't expect Oz
to pay for the limo!

484
00:34:41,123 --> 00:34:44,293
Stifler, fuck!
I mean...

485
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:48,422
Why do you got to be
so insensitive all the time?

486
00:34:49,464 --> 00:34:51,133
What?

487
00:34:52,259 --> 00:34:55,637
Whatever. Look, don't forget.
My cottage after prom.

488
00:34:55,721 --> 00:34:58,223
On Lake Michigan.

489
00:34:59,266 --> 00:35:01,935
Wait up, you pussies!

490
00:35:03,312 --> 00:35:05,731
Well, I gotta hit
the showers now...

491
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:09,568
but I think this is gonna
be really, really good.

492
00:35:09,651 --> 00:35:12,196
Yeah. Me too.

493
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:13,655
All right.

494
00:35:21,246 --> 00:35:25,417
- Happenin' Oz!
- Working with the choir chick?

495
00:35:25,501 --> 00:35:29,087
What d'ya say, fellas? I just dig
those cute little sweaters she wears.

496
00:35:29,171 --> 00:35:31,882
Nuts you do, you little horn dog.

497
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:36,011
Yeah!
Yeah, baby!

498
00:35:36,094 --> 00:35:38,597
Spank me!
Spank me!

499
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,641
Hit that high "C"!

500
00:35:46,355 --> 00:35:47,689
What's goin' on?

501
00:35:52,945 --> 00:35:55,405
I was being selfish
and majorly insensitive.

502
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:58,367
I'm a total idiot.
I mean, a fool, a buffoon.

503
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:00,953
I think shithead
really says it.

504
00:36:01,036 --> 00:36:05,541
You're right. I'm a shithead,
and I want to make it up to you.

505
00:36:05,624 --> 00:36:08,210
Oh, yeah? How?

506
00:36:11,755 --> 00:36:14,424
Vicky, shh.
Your parents are downstairs.

507
00:36:14,508 --> 00:36:17,636
- Kevin, don't stop!
-Just a second.

508
00:36:31,733 --> 00:36:35,904
Hon, can you tell Vic
to come on down for supper?

509
00:36:35,988 --> 00:36:37,781
Holy shit!

510
00:36:37,865 --> 00:36:41,827
Shh. You know there's
no lock on your door?

511
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,836
I'm coming!
I'm coming!

512
00:36:55,048 --> 00:36:56,717
- Oh, Jim!
- Dad.

513
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,345
I was just looking at
the old family portrait out here.

514
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:03,056
Well, that was
a fun day wasn't it?

515
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,601
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

516
00:37:05,684 --> 00:37:08,604
Jim, I want to talk
about masturbation.

517
00:37:10,022 --> 00:37:14,276
I just want you to know that
it's a perfectly normal thing.

518
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:16,528
And I have to admit,
you know...

519
00:37:16,612 --> 00:37:21,074
I did a fair bit of masturbating
when I was a little younger.

520
00:37:21,158 --> 00:37:25,287
I used to call it
"stroking the salami. "

521
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:27,789
You know,
"pounding the ol' pud. "

522
00:37:30,542 --> 00:37:32,711
I never did it with baked goods.
But you know your Uncle Mort?

523
00:37:32,794 --> 00:37:35,214
He "pinched the one-eyed snake"
six times a day.

524
00:37:35,297 --> 00:37:39,510
See, it's like practise
for the big game.

525
00:37:39,593 --> 00:37:42,721
You see?
It's like... It's like...

526
00:37:42,804 --> 00:37:46,099
banging a tennis ball
against a brick wall.

527
00:37:46,183 --> 00:37:50,145
Which can be fun.
It can be fun, but it's not a game.

528
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:52,606
- Right.
- It's not a game.

529
00:37:52,689 --> 00:37:56,151
What you want is you want
a partner to return the ball.

530
00:37:56,235 --> 00:37:59,738
- Do you want a partner?
- Yeah, I want a partner.

531
00:37:59,822 --> 00:38:01,740
- You do?
- I want a partner.

532
00:38:01,824 --> 00:38:05,869
Want a partner.
Good. Good.

533
00:38:08,747 --> 00:38:12,376
So, once Hal becomes king,
he has to take on...

534
00:38:12,459 --> 00:38:14,795
the responsibilities of leadership
and turn his back...

535
00:38:14,878 --> 00:38:17,381
on his old,
drunken friend, Falstaff.

536
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:21,927
You see, Hal is going through a rite
of passage, much like you all are.

537
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:26,431
So make most of the time you've got
left together. You'll miss it later.

538
00:38:26,515 --> 00:38:28,725
So, does your tongue cramp up?

539
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:31,895
Nah. You get kind of dizzy, though.

540
00:38:31,979 --> 00:38:36,733
Wow. That's amazing. She's probably
gonna want to do it soon.

541
00:38:39,736 --> 00:38:41,989
All right. Class dismissed.

542
00:38:44,449 --> 00:38:48,203
Still questing after
the Holy Grail, huh, guys?

543
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:57,171
- Hey, where's Finch?
- He went home to take a shit.

544
00:38:57,254 --> 00:39:01,550
I don't get it. How does a guy like that
get this sudden reputation?

545
00:39:01,633 --> 00:39:05,053
- What reputation?
- Observe.

546
00:39:05,137 --> 00:39:09,141
Excuse me.
Do you know who Paul Finch is?

547
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:11,560
Yeah! He's the guy
with the tattoo, right?

548
00:39:12,644 --> 00:39:16,648
You know, the eagle and the
blazing fire and that stuff.

549
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:22,321
If you guys see him later,
will you tell him Courtney says hi?

550
00:39:22,404 --> 00:39:23,447
Bye.

551
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:28,827
Okay. Explain.

552
00:39:28,911 --> 00:39:31,872
I can't. I don't know
how he's doing it.

553
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:35,209
I guess that just
leaves Jim trailing.

554
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:37,753
-Jimbo!
- Better sack up, buddy!

555
00:39:37,836 --> 00:39:40,005
Yeah, I know.
I'm working on it.

556
00:39:40,088 --> 00:39:43,967
James? You are very good
in the world history class, yes?

557
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:46,845
Me? Yes. No...

558
00:39:47,638 --> 00:39:49,223
Yes, I am.

559
00:39:49,306 --> 00:39:51,600
Perhaps you could help me
with my studies.

560
00:39:51,683 --> 00:39:55,938
Yeah. Absolutely.
That would be great sometime.

561
00:39:56,021 --> 00:40:00,567
- How about tomorrow?
- Well, I have ballet practise.

562
00:40:00,651 --> 00:40:03,821
Perhaps I could come
by your house afterwards?

563
00:40:03,904 --> 00:40:06,156
I could change clothes
at your place.

564
00:40:10,828 --> 00:40:13,664
Yeah. I suppose
that would be okay.

565
00:40:13,747 --> 00:40:15,624
Sure.

566
00:40:23,674 --> 00:40:26,093
Nice car!

567
00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:28,595
- I'm glad you think so.
- You don't like it?

568
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:32,057
No, I like the car.
By the way, though, about prom?

569
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,060
That was a bad idea.
I'm sorry I invited you.

570
00:40:35,143 --> 00:40:38,272
- What are you talkin' about?
- Please.

571
00:40:38,355 --> 00:40:41,775
I asked you because I thought
you might actually be worth going with.

572
00:40:41,859 --> 00:40:46,029
But you are just a jock.
No, wait. You're a jerk.

573
00:40:46,113 --> 00:40:48,699
Wait! I don't understand.

574
00:40:48,782 --> 00:40:52,411
I saw you making fun of me
with your lacrosse buddies.

575
00:40:52,494 --> 00:40:54,163
I wasn't makin' fun of you.

576
00:40:54,246 --> 00:40:56,832
Give me a break.
You're so full of it.

577
00:41:00,043 --> 00:41:05,132
Fuck me! There's gonna be an Eastern
European chick naked in your house.

578
00:41:05,215 --> 00:41:07,342
And you're not gonna
do anything about that?

579
00:41:07,426 --> 00:41:11,180
What am I gonna do, huh?
Broadcast her over the Internet?

580
00:41:11,263 --> 00:41:14,725
- Yeah.
- You can do that?

581
00:41:19,855 --> 00:41:22,274
No. I cannot do that to her.

582
00:41:22,357 --> 00:41:25,777
Jim, get some fuckin' balls.

583
00:41:25,861 --> 00:41:28,906
If you don't have the guts
to photograph a naked chick...

584
00:41:28,989 --> 00:41:30,657
how you gonna sleep with one?

585
00:41:30,741 --> 00:41:33,368
I don't like the kid,
but he's got a point.

586
00:41:33,452 --> 00:41:36,914
See, even Shit-break
knows you should do it.

587
00:41:36,997 --> 00:41:40,292
All you gotta do is set up some sort of
private link or whatever on the 'Net...

588
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:42,377
and tell me the address.

589
00:41:42,461 --> 00:41:45,255
You can send me
the address too.

590
00:41:45,339 --> 00:41:48,467
I'll save you a seat.

591
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:53,805
How sweet it is
to be loved by you, by you

592
00:41:53,889 --> 00:41:56,558
I needed the shelter
of someone's arms

593
00:41:56,642 --> 00:41:58,477
Someone's arms

594
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,356
- There you were
- You were

595
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:06,985
I needed someone
who understands my ups and downs

596
00:42:07,069 --> 00:42:09,071
There you were

597
00:42:09,154 --> 00:42:12,741
Okay, that was good,
but I want to thicken up that solo.

598
00:42:12,825 --> 00:42:15,828
Michigan State is this Saturday,
and I want that part to smoke.

599
00:42:15,911 --> 00:42:18,205
Yeah, I know,
my timing's off.

600
00:42:18,288 --> 00:42:21,959
It's not that. I think it'll work better
as a duet with a tenor part.

601
00:42:22,042 --> 00:42:24,002
I'll do it.

602
00:42:25,337 --> 00:42:27,965
- Dick.
- I'll do it.

603
00:42:28,048 --> 00:42:30,050
Great. See you tomorrow.

604
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:40,060
- Why are you doing this?
- 'Cause I want to.

605
00:42:40,143 --> 00:42:43,522
Yeah? Well,
you can't fake this.

606
00:42:43,605 --> 00:42:45,691
You better practise.

607
00:42:57,953 --> 00:42:59,079
Come in.

608
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:05,377
Jim? There's a...
a young lady here to see you.

609
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,713
- Hey, Nadia.
- Hi, James. Ready to study?

610
00:43:07,796 --> 00:43:10,507
He's always ready to study.
He's a real bookworm.

611
00:43:10,591 --> 00:43:12,050
Dad.

612
00:43:12,134 --> 00:43:14,052
He's not one of those
nerdy guys...

613
00:43:14,136 --> 00:43:15,512
Dad!

614
00:43:15,596 --> 00:43:19,016
Well, I'll let you two
hit the books.

615
00:43:23,145 --> 00:43:26,190
You want a beer?

616
00:43:26,273 --> 00:43:30,068
- Oh, there we go.
- Come on, move!

617
00:43:30,152 --> 00:43:34,656
Steve! It's my computer,
and I wanna use it!

618
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,241
Shut up!

619
00:43:36,325 --> 00:43:38,994
You need to change, right?

620
00:43:39,077 --> 00:43:42,206
- Uh, do you mind?
- No, not at all.

621
00:43:42,289 --> 00:43:45,667
Please, you know.
Just go ahead and get changed.

622
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:49,129
I'll go downstairs
and start studying up.

623
00:43:51,757 --> 00:43:53,800
There he goes.

624
00:43:53,884 --> 00:43:55,177
Now we're in business.

625
00:43:58,472 --> 00:44:00,682
- Back in a sec.
-Jimmy, honey...

626
00:44:23,956 --> 00:44:25,290
Here she is.

627
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,587
- Did I miss anything?
- No. You are just in time.

628
00:44:30,671 --> 00:44:34,091
- Oh. Oh!
- This is incredible.

629
00:44:34,174 --> 00:44:36,885
Oh, my God!
This is too much.

630
00:44:36,969 --> 00:44:39,972
Oh, did you see?
Oh, there that goes. Oh, Jeez.

631
00:44:40,472 --> 00:44:42,391
God bless the Internet.

632
00:44:44,685 --> 00:44:47,938
- Do it. Take it off.
- Oh, my God.

633
00:44:48,021 --> 00:44:50,732
Oh, thank you, God,
for this wonderful, wonderful day.

634
00:44:50,816 --> 00:44:53,360
She takes her vitamins.

635
00:44:57,489 --> 00:44:59,408
Stop hyperventilating.

636
00:45:04,454 --> 00:45:09,251
This is, like,
the coolest thing I've ever seen.

637
00:45:09,334 --> 00:45:10,961
I know.

638
00:45:12,588 --> 00:45:15,257
This is definitely one
of Stifler's best ideas ever.

639
00:45:16,842 --> 00:45:18,927
What is she...
She's touching my stuff.

640
00:45:19,011 --> 00:45:21,680
- Why is she touching my stuff?
- Let her touch.

641
00:45:21,763 --> 00:45:24,766
- She's going through my stuff!
- Nadia can touch anything she wants.

642
00:45:34,485 --> 00:45:36,945
- No, no.
- Nice collection there.

643
00:45:37,029 --> 00:45:39,698
She's gonna leave.
She's definitely gonna...

644
00:45:39,781 --> 00:45:42,409
She's getting comfortable.
She's not gonna leave.

645
00:45:42,493 --> 00:45:45,204
She reads the articles.

646
00:45:46,305 --> 00:45:52,271
