00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,120
Stella?

3
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,600
- Stella.
- No!

4
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,800
Look at them sugar warehouses

5
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,900
blowing up like
blasted paper bags.

6
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,100
Young madam.

7
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,900
It's all right, luv.

8
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,800
Come on. That's it.

9
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,500
Don't cry. You be a
good girl for your mum.

10
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,300
Shh, shh, shh. Don't worry.

11
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,000
Your father's gone.
Oh, no. Shh, shh.

12
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,400
Look. Pretty pearls.

13
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,100
Be a good girl, now.

14
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,200
It's all right. It's all right.

15
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,900
You be a good girl now,
and I'll be back soon.

16
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,200
Stella!
Stella, don't worry, luv.

17
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,200
You're all right.

18
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,600
Now, take deep breaths, Stella.

19
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,900
Stella, breathe deeply.
That's it.

20
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,900
Don't worry. You're all right.

21
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,600
How... now...

22
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,500
brown... cow.

23
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,200
How... now... 

24
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,700
brown... cow.

25
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,900
How now, brown cow.

26
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
How now, brown cow.

27
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,800
How now, brown cow.

28
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,900
How now, brown cow.

29
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,200
I didn't know it was
called Dramatic Art.

30
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,500
Hoo-er.

31
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,300
Oh, yes. It is.

32
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,200
I thought she was just
learning to speak properly.

33
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,900
Well, that's it, that's it.

34
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Oh. Well, I hope she's not in
for another disappointment.

35
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,400
Well, if she is,
I've told her

36
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,000
this time she'll end up
behind the counter

37
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,400
in Woolworths, my girl.
Or Boots.

38
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,800
And she'll be damn lucky
to get that and all.

39
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,800
Damn lucky. Oh, yes.

40
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,900
Hello, Mother?

41
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,700
It's Auntie Lily
and Uncle Vernon.

42
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,900
They ask too much of me.

43
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,800
Hello? Hello?

44
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,800
Yes, yes, yes.

45
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,900
It's a trunk call.

46
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,400
She's practicing acting

47
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,600
as if into a telephone

48
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,200
for her interview.

49
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,500
Oh? Oh.

50
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,000
Well, fancy that.

51
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,500
Mrs. Fairfield's out.

52
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,900
Can I take a message?
Yes, yes, yes.

53
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,600
It's a trunk call.

54
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,700
Should she walk
when on the phone?

55
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,900
Mrs. Fairfield's out.
Shall I take a message?

56
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,200
Mrs. Fairfield speaking.

57
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,800
Good Lord!

58
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,900
Sidney, don't say Good Lord.

59
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,000
No, that's not right.

60
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,400
How now, brown cow.

61
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,200
Won't do, young lady.
I'm expected.

62
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,100
Rose Lipman is known to me

63
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,200
which is how you've come
by this interview.

64
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,600
Audition! Have you
settled up with the taxi?

65
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,000
Yes. Here, here.

66
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,500
I'd rather die than tip him!

67
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,900
I think it degrades the giver

68
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,600
every bit as much
as the receiver.

69
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,100
Chuck it through the window
and hook it, then!

70
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,600
I'll go on the tram.

71
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,800
You'll arrive bedraggled.

72
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,900
She'll be soaked!
She'll ruin her hair!

73
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,900
Mrs. Fairfield says...

74
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,900
Sidney, I believe
the telephone is going--

75
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,900
Not a play that springs
immediately to mind, is it?

76
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,500
Off.

77
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,800
Hello? Hello?

78
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,900
Everybody is always out
when you need them most.

79
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,100
There's no need for that, Bunny.

80
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,900
Hello? Hello?

81
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,400
I think it's tea time.
Don't you?

82
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,200
Yes, yes, yes.
It-- it's a trunk call.

83
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,400
Not my fault.

84
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,700
Hello?

85
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,000
Hello?

86
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,600
The thing is...

87
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,000
I think she's a genius.
Don't you, Bunny?

88
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,600
Your promiscuity is humiliating.

89
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,000
<i># Even when the darkest clouds #</i>

90
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,900
<i># Are in the sky #</i>

91
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,400
<i># You mustn't sigh #</i>

92
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,600
<i># And you must not cry #</i>

00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,400

00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:35,400
<i># As you go by #</i>

95
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,800
I must keep my coat on.

96
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,800
Thank you.

97
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,000
But you're drenched. Huh?

98
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,100
That is not important.

99
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,800
Auntie Lily said time enough
for a new dress

100
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,200
when I get the job.

101
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,500
Yes.

102
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,100
I think I'm falling in love
with him, Mother.

103
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,600
I could've been afraid of him

104
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,800
but for his nicotine-stained fingers.

105
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,700
I know a man who
can't close his eyes.

106
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,600
He burned... in a bomb.

107
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,900
How interesting.

108
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,400
He was to be married

109
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,900
but his fiancée was afraid
that it would pass on

110
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,600
to the children
and threw him over.

111
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,100
It's all right.

112
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,200
But the worst thing, he says,

113
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,900
is people thinking
he looks fierce

114
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,400
when most days

115
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,200
he weeps.

116
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,300
Inside.

117
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,300
Oh, hell.

118
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,800
Well, I look forward to meeting
you again, Miss Bradshaw.

119
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,000
Congratulations.

120
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Oh?

121
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,900
Bunny here is our stage manager.

122
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,500
I think he ought to
take care of--

123
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,600
There's a taxi.

124
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,900
- No, I-- I--
- Taxi!

125
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,600
I have shopping to do,
thank you.

126
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,200
Uncle Vernon
never travels by cab

127
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,500
'cause he finds tipping degrading.

128
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,900
Isn't that foolish of him?

129
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,400
But you haven't seen me act,
Mr. Potter.

130
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,400
Oh, I rather think I have, what?

131
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,200
Stella?

132
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,400
Good evening.
My name is Stella Bradshaw.

133
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,500
I don't expect you'll
ever want to love me.

134
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,100
What you are is dog's bodies.

135
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,000
Assistant stage managers
they have to pay.

136
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,900
You're students.

137
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,900
So they don't have to pay you.

138
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,400
When you've been nine days
in an open boat

139
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,400
I expect you look on that
sort of thing with contempt.

140
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,900
George was in an open boat.

141
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,400
Oh.

142
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,800
For nine days.

143
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,600
Weren't you, George?

144
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,900
It's not as deep as all that.

145
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,500
Eh? What?

146
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,200
The stage, George.
It's not as deep as I expected.

147
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,000
I thought you meant the organ.

148
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,200
Too deep for me to see.

149
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,800
Here.
Keep your nice clothes clean.

150
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,500
Thank you.

151
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,500
It's not that I'm bored by
what you all did in the war.

152
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,400
But everybody has,
like, stories to tell

153
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,900
and bits of them to show

154
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,900
where they were hurt.

155
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,800
Oh, they will have.

156
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,700
Who's that?

157
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,900
That's P.L. O'Hara.

158
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,000
"Richard II" before the war.

159
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,400
I keep that notice
because it mentions me.

160
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,800
Not by name. The set.

161
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,400
He sent me that postcard
during the war.

162
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,900
Don't know why.

163
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,500
He was on the "Andrew,"
commanding a corvette.

164
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,800
Best Captain Hook we've had
in this theatre, the same.

165
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,500
Set for "Richard II"

166
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,400
on which I solved
the problem of the dungeon.

167
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,600
Ladies, gentlemen,
and others assorted

168
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,800
please find a seat.

169
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,600
It is rather fine.

170
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,200
But then, I love
beautiful things, don't you?

171
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,600
- Yes.
- Wait.

172
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,100
Morning, darling.

173
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,400
- Hello!
- How old is she, exactly?

174
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,200
Absolutely none of your business.

175
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,900
It's my fault.
I was trying to be pleasant.

176
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,200
She drinks.

177
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,900
Have I got time for a cup?

178
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,400
No. You're here to work,
young man, sit down.

179
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,700
Get some fags, will you?
What's your name?

180
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,900
Her name's Stella.

181
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,900
And she won't, Mr. Fairchild,
unless Bunny lets her.

182
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,900
Time hurries.

183
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,800
So, does everybody
know everybody?

184
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,600
This side.

185
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,200
Well, if you don't, you will.

186
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,100
And you all know me

187
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,200
or what they say about me.

188
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,000
And all of that is true.

189
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,900
So speak now if you don't

190
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,900
because we do "Dangerous Corner."

191
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,000
Two weeks' rehearsal,
play for two weeks

192
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,800
while we rehearse
"Caesar and Cleo."

193
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,700
Playing for two weeks,
while we rehearse "Peter Pan."

194
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:11,800
So, the thing is,
it's a very heavy season

195
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:16,400
and you're all going to have
to work very, very hard.

196
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,300
But you're all the very
best people we could find

197
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,200
the length and breadth
of the profession.

198
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,200
Aww!

199
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,700
For the money.

200
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,900
Welcome.
I think you're all very good.

201
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,200
I mean...

202
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,900
wonderful.

203
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,200
You wanted to know the truth
and here it is!

204
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,600
Some of it.

205
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,700
She's been in love
with you for ages.

206
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,600
Wives are always
aware of these things, you know.

207
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,400
I'll tell you what I have longed
to tell you for some time

208
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,700
that I think you're a fool
for not having responded to it.

209
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:02,100
For not having done something
about it before now.

210
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,900
Sorry.

211
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,400
Doesn't matter. Go on, go on!

212
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,600
When somebody loves you
like that

213
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,900
for God's sake,
make the most of it

214
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,000
before it's too late.

215
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,600
Leave it!

216
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,200
Stop fussing
like an old queen, Bunny!

217
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,200
Stella.

218
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,300
Ten minutes.

219
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,700
Darling, I'd like you to take
some notes for me.

220
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,500
Care for a snifter, squire?

221
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,600
Do you know where
the general post office is?

222
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,100
Of course. I live here.

223
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,200
Of course you do.
I think that's charming.

224
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,900
Now, I want you
to run all the way

225
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,900
and don't change a word.

226
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,700
There you are.

227
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,700
Ten bob.
That's two and six change.

228
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,400
Bunny! Where's Bunny?

229
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,600
Bunny!

230
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,800
Meredith, old boy,

231
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,900
when are we gonna
get onto the stage?

232
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,600
The old green, huh?

233
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,800
I'm having a bit of trouble
finding my character.

234
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,200
Mmm. So I'd noticed.

235
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,700
A cup of tea, please.

236
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,900
One of those, thanks.

237
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,200
There's a man next to you

238
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,700
whose toes can be seen
through his boots.

239
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,000
Oh, my God, I can smell it.

240
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,900
There's no need to be so loud.

241
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,200
People have feelings.

242
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,800
A minute longer
and you'd be scratching.

243
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:09,400
<i>"Darling Hilary stop.
In hell stop."</i>

244
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,000
<i>"You must ring stop."</i>

245
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,900
<i>"Reverse charges."</i>

246
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,400
<i>"I love you. Meredith."</i>

247
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,900
Oh!

248
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,300
What's this about Hilary?

249
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,900
I phoned twice
this morning, Bunny.

250
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,900
I mean...

251
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,900
not a dicky bird.

252
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,400
Well, perhaps the bill
hasn't been paid.

253
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,500
It has. I paid it.

254
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,600
Of course, that girl is
in love with you, too

255
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,000
if that's any comfort.

256
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,800
Stella by Starlight?

257
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,900
<i>"Don't bother to telephone stop."</i>

258
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,400
<i>"Will not accept
reverse charges stop."</i>

259
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,600
<i>"Yours, Meredith."</i>

260
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,300
Thank you.

261
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,700
If I could,
I'd take you away from all this.

262
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,900
I'm sorry.

263
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,700
You're afraid of dirt.

264
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,300
Better than lurking in corridors
for Meredith Potter

265
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,100
with a copy of Shakespeare
at hand in case he notices you.

266
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,900
What about you, then?

267
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,400
Got a pash on him?

268
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,700
He's not here anyway.

269
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,200
In London with the designer,
I'm told.

270
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,200
I know.

271
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,800
Why don't you like George?

272
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,600
I do.
He has native intelligence.

273
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,600
- He's not a nigger.
- What?

274
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,200
He went straight from St. Aloysius'

275
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,600
to the Royal Court as a stagehand.

276
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,900
If he slopped glue

277
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,600
he was hit on the head
with the brush.

278
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,200
If he made a noise,
he was fined sixpence.

279
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:08,000
They all were.
Then he came here as a day man.

280
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,700
They were all something.

281
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:14,800
At sea. Over Germany.
In the desert.

282
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,900
Well, Mother, I might as well
get it over with

283
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,800
s-so that when the moment
comes to be p-penetrated

284
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:38,400
by Mr. Potter,
I shall not put him off

285
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,200
scream... or anything.

286
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,800
I don't like the feel of it.

287
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,500
Thank you very much, Geoffrey.

288
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,900
It's not that
I don't like old George.

289
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,000
It's just that he stinks.

290
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,900
I'll put these on the boiler.

291
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,800
Leave it! Leave it!

292
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,800
You'll have us all
blown to eternity!

293
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,000
I can do it!

294
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Oh, can you? Can you?

295
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,800
Look at you!

296
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,600
Blow us all to buggery.

297
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,900
At the theatre
I have a lot to do with gas.

298
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,400
It's one of my jobs is gas.

299
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,700
Oh, is it?

300
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,800
I hope you know what
you're doing there all hours.

301
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,700
All kinds of hours.

302
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,700
What do you know of life?

303
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,100
The way that life
can bowl you over?

304
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,000
Bowl you over!

305
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,600
But not here it won't.

306
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,400
You put that on the door.

307
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,400
Unless you want all and sundry
catching you in your vest.

308
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,500
Uncle Vernon?

309
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:33,700
I know you want
what's best for me.

310
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:37,600
A-and...

311
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,600
fear for me, don't you?

312
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,400
But it's all right.

313
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,000
I want it to happen.

314
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,900
And...

315
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,400
Really,
I-- I think the world of you.

316
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,900
I've cleaned the tidemark

317
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,300
and put the loofah
back under the stairs.

318
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,300
Night-night.

319
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,100
Nighty-night. God bless.

320
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,300
Night-night.

321
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,200
Night-night.

322
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,200
Do I do the right thing?

323
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,700
If the school
won't have her back...

324
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,300
Not won't. Not won't.

325
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,300
Well, they don't think
she'd benefit.

326
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,800
She's got the brains.
Candles. But not...

327
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,800
Oh, yes. Anything else?

328
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,400
...the application.
Toilet rolls.

329
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,600
Quantity two dozen.

330
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,900
Afraid I can only manage...

331
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,700
She's burgeoning, you know.

332
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,400
Is she?

333
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,200
- Is your daughter?
- What?

334
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:33,500
Burgeoning, as it were, yet?

335
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,300
I don't know.

336
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,400
I haven't looked.

337
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,900
No, no, no!
It's the one on the left!

338
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,500
The left, dear!
She's deaf as a post.

339
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,700
Yes, well, it's your right.
Thank you.

340
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,100
Now, Geoffrey,
move stage left.

341
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,700
Stage left.
Thank you very much.

342
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,000
Thank you, no. Number 8?

343
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,500
- No, thank you.
- Shall I move stage left?

344
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,600
Geoffrey, is that where
I asked you to stand?

345
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,800
I was trying--

346
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,200
Please stand where
I asked you to stand!

347
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,900
- Sorry.
- Number 10?

348
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,900
Footlights.
That takes me back.

349
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,800
No. Number 11.

350
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,200
Now, that's very close.
Thank you.

351
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,600
The play's awfully good,
isn't it, Mr. Potter?

352
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,000
Why this wasn't sorted out
yesterday is beyond me.

353
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,300
I'm coming in!

354
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,700
What do you think it's about,
Stella?

355
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,400
Now, there are two ways
of doing this...

356
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,600
Love?

357
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,000
Uh, love.

358
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,000
Is it?

359
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:46,700
People loving people
who love other people?

360
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,300
No, no. Thank you.

361
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,800
I, um...

362
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:57,000
I think it's about time.

363
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,900
I think we're all mourners
at a funeral procession

364
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,800
and that some of us
have simply dropped behind

365
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,600
to tie a shoelace.

366
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,300
So contact with the beloved
is suspended.

367
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,400
But the dead--
the dead are still there.

368
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:21,000
So, too,
those we think we love.

369
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,600
Just around

370
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,100
the dangerous corner,
if you like...

371
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,400
waiting to be, um...

372
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,800
Hilary!

373
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,700
Bunny. How long?

374
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,700
Weeks at this rate.

375
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,000
Caught up with--
waiting to be caught up with.

376
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,400
I-- I hadn't thought of it
like that.

377
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,400
No.

378
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,400
Stella. Stella!

379
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,600
Call beginners, please.

380
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,600
Don't you think they're good,
Stella's notes?

381
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,600
I mean, I wish
I could spell like that.

382
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,400
Mourners at a "funral,"
is my favourite bit.

383
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,500
It's cold now!

384
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,000
I hate cold bacon.

385
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,900
We haven't all got
shoes with laces.

386
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,900
All beginners, please!

387
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,400
Beginners, please!

388
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,400
- Fetch Bunny.
- What's that noise?

389
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,100
Not a word.

390
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,200
Why can't we start?!

391
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,600
Th-there's a spot of bother.

392
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,600
Huh? Speak up. What is wrong?

393
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,400
I've been forbidden to divulge.

394
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,200
How long?! 

395
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,200
Leave her!

396
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,400
He's such a shit!

397
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,000
Cheer up, Stella.
It might never happen.

398
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,100
There are priests out there.

399
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,200
Only for rehearsals.
It's a sin otherwise.

400
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,600
His Nibs is a convert.

401
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,900
Mr. Potter's Catholic?

402
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,600
Well, they all are. Actors.

403
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,200
Desmond Fairchild, he's not.

404
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,900
What is he?

405
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,400
Hold it under there,
like that.

406
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,000
Deep breaths, Miss Allenby.

407
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,200
Remember your training.

408
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,900
Stand by, Mr. Fairchild, please.

409
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,000
House lights.

410
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,500
Going up.

411
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,400
You have just
been listening to a play

412
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,800
in eight scenes
written for broadcasting

413
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:33,900
by Mr. Humphrey Stoat,
called "The Sleeping Dog."

414
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,500
Hello, Mother.

415
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,900
I'm becoming a Catholic.

416
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,800
You'd like the play.

417
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:55,000
At the end,
they dance to that tune

418
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,200
"My Foolish Heart."

419
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,600
<i># When I take my sugar to tea #</i>

420
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,700
<i># All the boys are jealous of me #</i>

421
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,900
<i># 'Cause I never take her
where the gang goes #</i>

422
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,500
<i># When I take my sugar to tea #</i>

423
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,000
<i># I'm a rowdy dowdy, that's me #</i>

424
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,900
<i># She's a high hat baby,
that's she #</i>

425
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,900
<i># So I never take her
where the gang goes #</i>

426
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,900
<i># When I take my sugar to tea #</i>

427
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,600
<i># Every Sunday afternoon #</i>

428
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,200
<i># We forget about our cares #</i>

429
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,400
<i># Rubbing elbows at the Ritz #</i>

430
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,400
Ah, Dotty's over there.
Shall we join them?

431
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,900
Oh, let's not.

432
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,600
Oh, poor Dicky.

433
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,900
What a cross he has to bear.

434
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,000
Drunk as
a fiddler's bitch she was.

435
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,900
Is. Will be. Ha ha ha!

436
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,500
Some people like being burdened.

437
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,500
Gives them an interest.

438
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,200
Obsession?

439
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,600
Obsession is hell!

440
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,300
It devours.

441
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,400
Oh, I haven't forgotten
the misery of it.

442
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,800
Him! P.L. O'Hara.

443
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,000
Though everybody warned me.

444
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,900
I mean, he chased
everything in a skirt.

445
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,900
Dicky isn't like that.

446
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:10,000
No, but Dawn is. Trousers.

447
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,200
Poor Dicky.

448
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,800
Poor Dicky and his trousers.

449
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,900
Oh, P.L., P.L.!

450
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,100
I thought
I could help him forget.

451
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,800
About what?

452
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,600
What he did.

453
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,800
Got a local girl in trouble
and scarpered.

454
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:33,000
Is Mr. Potter's friend
o-obsessed with him?

455
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,900
Bunny?

456
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,400
Hilary.

457
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,900
Do you know, treasure,
I don't know.

458
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,600
Is she pretty? Is she elegant?

459
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,000
She'd have to be special.

460
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,600
Any lady friend of Meredith's

461
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,300
would have to be
something special.

462
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,300
How very true.

463
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,800
What about Desmond Fairchild?

464
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,800
What's your estimation of him?

465
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,400
He's a cunt.

466
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,900
Belated afternoon to you girls.

467
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,100
I shall give her a part.

468
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,800
Of course, he is.
She shall play...

469
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,200
She shall play
Ptolemy, the boy king, hmm?

470
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,700
Save getting an amateur in.

471
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:35,400
Trouble is, Fairchild is
a local councilor's nephew.

472
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,000
Is he?

473
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,900
Maybe you should
talk to her, then, Bunny.

474
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,000
Wash her mouth out with soap.

475
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,900
Stella...

476
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,200
Can't stop or
it won't stretch, George says.

477
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,100
It's been
brought to my notice

478
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,200
that you called
a member of the company a...

479
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,100
Is that how you spell it?

480
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,240
This is a theatre,

481
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,400
George told me he was.

482
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,900
Isn't it something to do
with betting, like favourite?

483
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,400
Spend less time
in the prop room.

484
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,800
Ptolemy. The boy king.
Son of the flute-blower.

485
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,400
He's only in Act II.

486
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,900
Geoffrey, don't stand about.
You'll turn to stone.

487
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,900
You're a bit lucky.

488
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,800
Luck doesn't come into it.

489
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:04,700
Mr. Potter wouldn't ask me if
he didn't think I could do it.

490
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:44,900
I'm being interviewed by
the "Manchester Daily News."

491
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,600
I'm at the Reparatory Theatre.

492
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,000
I play the boy king.

493
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,000
S'all right for some.

494
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,700
Son of the flute-blower?

495
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,900
Didn't he want
his welsh rarebit?

496
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,400
I'm 16 years old.

497
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,100
I've got a diploma from

498
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,100
the Manchester
Academy of Dramatic Art.

499
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,500
I can also do American dialects
from the Deep South.

500
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,400
I was trained by Mrs. Ackerley.

501
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,700
She plumped out me vowels.
I tend to have flat ones.

502
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,200
I'll wait for you
after the show.

503
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,900
Take you for a drink.

504
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:35,800
Oh! Good girl! Ohh!

505
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,900
How do you get V.D.?

506
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,900
All the newspapers.
Even Manchester.

507
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,300
There'll be many's
the write-up for our Stella

508
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,600
but this'll be
the important one, now.

509
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,000
On the doorstep of my digs
this morning

510
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,100
with a bloody great bunch
of half-dead daffodils.

511
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,900
- Who?
- Dawn Allenby, who do you think?

512
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,000
I had to let her in.

513
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,000
She started picking up my socks.

514
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,000
Ohh! She drinks.

515
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,600
- We know.
- We know. 

516
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,400
Why does Richard St. Ives

517
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,600
put a red dot
in the corner of each eye?

518
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,400
To make him look younger.

519
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,600
How dare you?!

520
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,300
How dare he?

521
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,900
All right, Stella?

522
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,300
Good luck.

523
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,400
House lights, Joe.

524
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,500
Ah! By Apis, Persian,
thy gods are good to thee.

525
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,900
Try yet again, Captain.
Double or quits.

526
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,900
No, I am not in the vein.

527
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,700
Stand! Who goes there?

528
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,500
Good night, old boy!

529
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,100
T-there's this man.

530
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,300
A boy--

531
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:47,800
Been given my bloody notice.

532
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:52,800
Not wanted after
"Caesar and Cleopatra."

533
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,000
Oh, dear.

534
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:59,600
Swine. What a swine.

535
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,800
Tells me there's nothing for me.

536
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:08,400
Looking at me
through that bloody monocle.

537
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,900
Bloody swine.

538
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,100
Swine Meredith bloody Potter.

539
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,900
What about bloody Wendy?

540
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,100
Mr. Potter's not to blame!

541
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,600
It was Dicky St. Ives
said it was you or him.

542
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Come on, then! Be a good--

543
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,300
No! Stay away!

544
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,200
Ha! I only drink

545
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,900
because our house
took a direct hit in Ealing.

546
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,700
I'm not like that!
I'm sorry.

547
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,000
For two days,
I was buried alive

548
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,900
nursing my mother's vase.

549
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,600
Oh, dear.
What are we to do?

550
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,000
When they pulled me out

551
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:56,400
the vase was without so much
as a single crack.

552
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:56,400
The thing is...

553
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,700
Then the bloody rescue man
stumbled.

554
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,900
I have a gulp in my throat
won't go away.

555
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,500
As if I'm waiting for something.

556
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,400
What are you doing here,
young lady?

557
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,500
N-nothing, Miss Lipman.

558
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,900
These new shoes are killing me.

559
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,000
They're gone, Vernon and Lily.

560
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:42,000
It's not them. It's a young man.

561
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,300
A reporter.

562
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,900
He pursues me

563
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,900
and awaits me in the shadows.

564
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,400
I've ordered a taxi.

565
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,100
Silly girl.

566
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:06,500
What'll become of her, Bunny?

567
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:10,000
What will become of you?

568
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,400
If you're lucky,
you'll end up like me.

569
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,400
At least me...

570
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:19,000
I was as silly as you
in a lot of ways. Still am.

571
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,600
A sickness, my girl,
being something else.

572
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:27,000
See you don't get lost
while you are something else.

573
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,600
Came to the right place for it,
I'll say that.

574
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:42,000
Listening to every word we say.

575
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,100
Look...

576
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:50,800
And this stuck in her sock.

577
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,900
I find it comforting.

578
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,100
You're never a Catholic.

579
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,000
Vernon Bradshaw
wouldn't let you near--

580
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,900
Uncle Vernon
does not rule my life.

581
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,200
Not this nor in the next.

582
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,200
I'm thinking about going over.

583
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,600
To the Romans.

584
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:11,000
While you think, wear
a smaller one round your neck.

585
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,300
Don't tell Uncle Vernon.

586
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,800
All right, but behave yourself.

587
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:19,800
I do rule your life while
you're in this theatre, my girl.

588
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,300
Be what you like.

589
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,000
Don't tell the whole of
Liverpool I said you could.

590
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,200
While you're on the cross

591
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,900
there's a boil coming in
on your wrist should be lanced.

592
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,900
Anything else?

593
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,500
No.

594
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,900
Right. Left foot forward.

595
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,200
Thank you.

596
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,400
Stella?

597
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,700
Go down to the kitchen

598
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,400
and ask the waiter
with a dent in his forehead

599
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,200
to send up
a bucket full of ice cubes

600
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,100
and two or three napkins.

601
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,900
And then get lots of
black coffee and some aspirin.

602
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,800
Last night
he thought he could fly

603
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,600
from a window at The Commercial.

604
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,600
Fortunately at
the bar parlour window.

605
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,300
I've got a part in this one.

606
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:10,000
As I live and breathe,
Peter Pan!

607
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,400
- Slightly!
- Very same.

608
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,900
Scala Theatre, 1922.

609
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:22,900
'Course I've-- I've
grown somewhat since then.

610
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,200
Oh, yes! Mmm!

611
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,300
Oh, who's Hook this time?

612
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,200
- Dicky St. Ives.
- Oh, bugger.

613
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,700
Morning, Dicky.
How are you, squire?

614
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,100
Very, very well.

615
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,100
Geoffrey!

616
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,200
Get me 20 Players, will you?

617
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,900
What did
your last servant die of?

618
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,900
Do as you're told, Geoffrey.

619
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,900
Hoity-toity this morning,
aren't we?

620
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,600
Thank you, Stella.

621
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,300
And there's your torch.
Remember what I told you?

622
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,300
I can't.

623
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,900
Not shine a torch and
ring a bell at the same time.

624
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,200
Weren't you
in the Girl Guides, dear?

625
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,400
No. They wouldn't have me.

626
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:03,300
And I have an aversion
to flickering lights.

627
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,800
Something in me past.

628
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:08,800
Little candle flames
make me shiver.

629
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,100
I cannot go into it here.

630
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:16,000
Sufficient to say,
it is the stuff of nightmares.

631
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,700
You-- None of you know--

632
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,500
I don't know.

633
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:27,800
I'm not qualified
to say whether the grief

634
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:31,400
his mother felt in the death
of his elder brother had an

635
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:35,100
adverse effect on Mr. Barrie's
emotional development

636
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,900
because...

637
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,100
I have pains of my own.

638
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,400
Me. Not you.

639
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:50,200
Or you or you or anyone.

640
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:51,500
I-- Me!

641
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:56,400
I... I... have them.

642
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:07,200
"Peter Pan"
is pure make-believe.

643
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:10,300
I don't want any truck
with anything else

644
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:15,900
so, children,
and poor people

645
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,700
if you can't see the truth,
give me make-believe.

646
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,400
I prefer it.

647
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:26,400
So don't give me any symbolic...

648
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,200
Ohh!

649
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,900
Shambolic more like, what?

650
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,900
What are you miserable about?

651
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,900
Nothing.

652
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,800
Is it because I've got a part

653
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,300
and you've only
a torch and a bell?

654
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,900
Tinkerbell's very important.

655
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,300
In this precarious profession

656
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,900
it doesn't do to get too big
for one's boots.

657
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
So, what were you doing the other night
swearing at Meredith

658
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,800
and running down the stairs
like a looney?

659
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,400
What were you doing spying?

660
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:09,300
I was coping with Dawn.

661
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,200
Poor woman.

662
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:13,100
She was two days under rubble.

663
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,900
They all were.

664
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,900
It-- It's Mr. Potter.

665
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:24,900
He hardly knows I'm there.

666
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:28,000
He can't feel anything of me...

667
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:29,900
here.

668
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,500
He should be able to.

669
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,400
He's got other things
to think about.

670
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,000
Thank you, Jimmy.

671
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:47,200
Oh, dear, dear.

672
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,200
The last thing we need.

673
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,600
<i>"Dearest Swine,</i>

674
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,700
<i>"no money, no job, no friends.</i>

675
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:20,700
<i>"Hope you and that ghastly
Liverpool girl are satisfied.</i>

676
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,900
<i>"Use this in memory of me.
Yours, Dawn Allenby."</i>

677
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,600
"Manchester Daily News,
November 9th."

678
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,000
Up and out, please!

679
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,600
That means you, too,
Miss Bradshaw.

680
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,000
A marvellous man this Caesar.

681
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,800
When think you he will come?

682
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:13,600
He was settling
the Jewish problem when I left.

683
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,000
<i>"In other roles,
a promising debut was made</i>

684
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:38,100
<i>"by young local actress
Stella Bradshaw.</i>

685
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,900
<i>"In the part of Ptolemy,
she was always convincing..."</i>

686
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:47,300
See, my ship is waiting.

687
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,000
The time for Caesar's farewell
to Egypt has arrived.

688
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,800
Caesar comes!

689
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,900
Attention there!
Here comes Caesar!

690
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,500
What the--

691
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:06,300
Aah! Oh, no!

692
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,900
All right, squire?

693
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:11,000
That bloody woman! Ohh!

694
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,600
Thank you.

695
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:19,700
This has never happened before,
not even for miscarriages.

696
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,800
What's wrong with
Desmond Fairchild?

697
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,000
Why could he not go on?

698
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,300
Says he hasn't the legs
for Caesar.

699
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,400
He would be a laughing-stock.

700
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,700
So what about Captain Hook?

701
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,800
Says he's suited
with the part of Smee...

702
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,200
Thank you very much.

703
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,900
Oh, for God's sake, are you sure
Dicky can't stand up?

704
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,200
Meredith, the poor man has
broken his leg in two places.

705
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:39,100
Yes, that's £1,10 shillings.

706
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,900
Enjoy the--
Oh, what am I saying?

707
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:43,200
What about that actor always
sending me photographs?

708
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:46,000
His wife phoned to ask
for them back. He's dead.

709
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,100
- What about Cyril?
- Who's Cyril?

710
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:50,400

711
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,900
Oh, yes, Cyril What's-his-name
I did know at Derby.

712
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:55,300
And he later lost both his legs
at the first Battle of Alamein.

713
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,000
I mean, try, Bunny!

714
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,300
O'Hara.

715
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,200
- No.
- Why not?

716
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,800
The thing is, Rose,
I don't-- I don't--

717
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,500
If he's free,
he'll come for me.

718
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,600
The thing is,
I don't think he's right for it.

719
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,300
Do you, Bunny?

720
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,900
Fiddlesticks!

721
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:14,900
He is the best Captain Hook
there has ever been.

722
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:06,600
Haven't changed.

723
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:09,600
Still hankering
after the past, I see.

724
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,500
Bloody motorbike at your age.

725
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:17,900
What is it,
next week "Lawrence of Arabia"?

726
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,200
Mind you don't fall off.

727
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,200
Six-week run. Two matinees
a week from Tuesday.

728
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,900
All right with Potter
after last time?

729
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,300
Funny bugger.
Spent too much money

730
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,600
on two big productions,
one after the other

731
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:40,100
and now we won't break even.
Well, we might.

732
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,900
With "Peter Pan." With you.

733
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:50,900
I don't do that
with everyone, so mind.

734
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,800
Welcome home.

735
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:07,200
I know this is
your old dressing room.

736
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,800
George told me.

737
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:13,500
I'm Stella. A student.

738
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,900
Should be A.S.M.
as George says

739
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,500
but they won't pay us.

740
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:23,800
You have to kick the pipes to
get the water out of the taps.

741
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,800
I expect you didn't know.

742
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:28,800
Do you know Mary Deare,
Peter Pan?

743
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,400
I think she's very good,
don't you?

744
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:33,200
How strange it is.

745
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:36,900
You and me. Together.
I mean, here.

746
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,500
After all these years.

747
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,300
Did you ever
get my Christmas cards?

748
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,400
I never forgot.

749
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:48,400
But then you never were one
to dwell on the past, were you?

750
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,600
I'm not called.

751
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,700
I just came in to see you.

752
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,300
They're all very nice.

753
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,100
Miss Bird is very nice.

754
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:05,900
So's Miss Blundell.
Very nice, too.

755
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:08,100
Uh, Sibyl, a brew?

756
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:11,500
Mr. Fairchild is...

757
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,200
Hmm?

758
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:15,600
I do know other words

759
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:19,400
but nobody usually likes
the sound of them.

760
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:26,300
I know her.

761
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,400
Stella? Oh, hardly, darling.

762
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,700
First job. Never been
further than Blackpool.

763
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,500
I know him.

764
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,300
Now is the hour

765
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,600
when children
in their homes are abed.

766
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,200
Their lips bright-browned
with the good-night chocolate.

767
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:06,900
And their tongues drowsily
searching for belated crumbs

768
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:11,400
housed insecurely
on their shining cheeks.

769
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:15,400
Compare with them

770
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:19,400
the children on this boat
about to walk the plank.

771
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,900
Split my infinitives

772
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,100
but 'tis my hour of triumph!

773
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,600
Yo-ho, yo-ho,

774
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:32,900
The frisky captain
walks along and so...

775
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,800
And yet

776
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:40,300
some disky spirit
compels me now

777
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,000
to make my dying speech.

778
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,900
Lest when dying

779
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,700
there may be...

780
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,600
"No time for it."

781
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:00,900
Should one pause there?

782
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,600
Yes.

783
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:05,800
No, no, I mean
should we pause there?

784
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,900
Good time to break. Mary?

785
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:09,900
I-- I thought...

786
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:15,100
Mr. O'Hara,
can I get you a cup of tea?

787
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,800
Yes. Thanks.

788
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:18,700
Bunny?

789
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:23,600
Mr. Potter doesn't ask me
to do notes anymore.

790
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,200
Have I upset him, Bunny?

791
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:32,500
I shouldn't think so, dear.
Not you.

792
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:36,200
Did you come back for me,
P.L., or something else?

793
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:41,000
You. I owe you a great deal.

794
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:43,600
What you been looking for?

795
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,600
You can't do anything
I don't hear about

796
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:50,000
on that motorbike.

797
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:54,500
You won't find her. Not now.

798
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,000
I might.

799
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:03,500
Or I might find him.

800
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:04,900
How will you know?

801
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:09,400
I'll know.

802
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:17,400
A little chap
that stands like me.

803
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:18,700
How's that?

804
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,800
Heroical. Twice nightly.

805
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:02,600
Leave it.

806
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:09,900
Disley?

807
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,800
Disley!

808
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:16,600
Do you want the nursery set
stage left or stage right?

809
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,700
- Stella!
- Are you sure?

810
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:20,000
Because
it's got to be even numbers.

811
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,400
Cup of tea, dear.

812
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:22,800
- George?
- Uh-huh?

813
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:24,800
I want the nursery set
in next, please.

814
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:26,800
Hey!

815
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,900
Good of you to join us,
Geoffrey.

816
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,800
Right! Let's hang the cloths!

817
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,800
Careful.

818
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:56,900
Let's take it up.

819
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:59,900
Easy! Right!

820
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:03,000
Fly it! Stella, I'll do it.

821
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:05,600
Gently!
Steady, steady, steady!

822
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,400
That's it, that's it.

823
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,900
That's it. Yes, good!

824
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:16,000
Oh, Disley, it's beautiful.

825
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,100
Do you like it?
Wait till it's lit.

826
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,800
Yes, well done, Disley.
It's beautiful.

827
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:23,900
Wait till it's lit.

828
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:37,900
No, thanks.

829
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:41,700
I've had more than enough
for one morning.

830
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:56,800
Well... Ahem!

831
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,900
It's, um...

832
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,100
Not far enough upstage...
by two foot.

833
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,800
Well, it can't go
any further back.

834
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:07,600
It's already
on the last set of lines.

835
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,900
Well, it's too far downstage.

836
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:11,800
What do you
propose I do about it?

837
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,400
I don't know.

838
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:16,600
Hang it from below the bridge
and tumble it.

839
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:21,400
You do know how to tumble
a cloth, don't you, Bunny?

840
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:23,900
Oh, dear, Bunny doesn't know how
to tumble a cloth.

841
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:25,100
George, can you help?

842
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,000
Now we'll have
to re-hang everything!

843
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Well, you should've got it right
the first time.

844
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:32,600
I need depth.
Every inch you can give me.

845
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:33,900
Eh, George?

846
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:43,200
Well, you have the wish
to come with me, Geoff-wey

847
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:45,600
or do you want to stay here
with Mr. Potter?

848
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:48,800
Oh? Oh? Geoff-wey!

849
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:51,200
Well, Geoffrey?

850
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,300
Sorry. What does he call you?
Your new friend?

851
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,600
Geoff-wey? Go on, Geoff-wey!

852
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:57,800
Get up them stairs.
You might learn something.

853
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:01,000
"Bring me out that doodle-doo!"

854
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,300
Morning.

855
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:06,400
Launched me pirate ship yet?

856
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:08,000
Not quite, no.

857
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:09,900
Perhaps
you ought to show us how

858
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:12,700
being a jolly jack tar,
and all, hmm?

859
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,700
Or a matelot, and all.

860
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,900
Tiddly drop of thickers, George.

861
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,900
I think he makes
a very good Captain Hook

862
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:32,900
don't you, Stella? Hmm?

863
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:50,600
How still the night is.

864
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:56,900
Nothing sounds alive.

865
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:01,800
Now is the hour

866
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:05,500
when children
in their homes are abed

867
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:08,300
their lips bright-browned

868
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,900
with the good-night chocolate.

869
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:16,100
And their tongues
drowsily searching

870
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,800
for belated crumbs

871
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:22,000
housed insecurely
on their shining cheeks.

872
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,200
Compare with them

873
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:30,300
the children on this boat
about to walk the plank.

874
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:35,000
Split my infinitives

875
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:40,200
but 'tis my hour of triumph!

876
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:50,800
And yet...

877
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:57,700
some disky spirit
compels me now

878
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:00,700
to make my dying speech

879
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:03,200
lest when dying...

880
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:08,400
there may be no time for it.

881
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:29,900
As usual, a child being sick
during my quiet scene.

882
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:32,000
Well done, Shirley.
Oh, thank you.

883
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,400
There's a Christmas party.

884
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:36,900
You were very good
with the torch. 

885
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:01,900
Un triomphe!

886
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,100
Over there.

887
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:21,300
You sit down there.

888
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,500
All right.

889
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:25,400
John!

890
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:27,100
I can't go on like this.
We have to talk.

891
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:28,900
Oh, I think
everyone ought to talk.

892
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:30,200
I think you ought to dance,
as well.

893
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:32,900
He's thinking about
leaving the theatre.

894
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,600
We've saved you
a seat here, darling.

895
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:39,000
Come on.

896
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,300
Look at her hair. What a colour.

897
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,700
I know! Isn't it tedious?

898
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:47,900
Thank you, darling.

899
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:02,900
Everybody
looked at someone else

900
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,500
even while
they were talking to somebody.

901
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:10,000
It's not easy to do.

902
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:13,000
I thought you understood.

903
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:15,600
Don't let it get you down,
Geoff-wey.

904
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:20,900
What's going on there?

905
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:23,600
Meredith.

906
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:25,100
He's up to his usual nonsense.

907
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,400
You're ruining my life.

908
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:34,100
You can't force him
to give you better parts.

909
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,200
You mind your own business.
You know nothing about it.

910
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,400
Would you like to dance?

911
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:46,300
I-- I'm no good at it.

912
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:16,600
Keep the hands up.

913
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:27,000
Yes.

914
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:28,800
Huh?

915
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,300
Where's Meredith?

916
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:35,900
Went to midnight mass.

917
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:38,400
With Bunny.
They've just gone.

918
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,600
Shall I give you a lift home?

919
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:41,900
Y-yes.

920
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,900
Stop! Stop, please!

921
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:10,400
Here'll do.

922
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:12,300
I want to phone me mother.

923
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,000
Would you like a cup of tea?

924
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:09,700
Damp.

925
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:15,900
Turpentine.

926
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:21,200
I had a friend who painted.

927
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:31,900
You look at me as if
I might fly up the chimney.

928
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:21,600
It shouldn't be
quite like that, you know?

929
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,000
There are things come first.

930
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:32,900
Lots of things.

931
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:38,800
For instance, you have
to take your knickers off.

932
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,500
Or shall I?

933
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,000
If you like.

934
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:00,900
Stella...

935
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:05,000
Stella...

936
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:12,800
Stella Maris...

937
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:36,400
Who's Stella Maris?

938
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:46,400
I knew someone called that.

939
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:53,500
"Star of the sea."

940
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,300
Stella Maris.

941
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:03,300
That's nice.

942
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:08,900
It's not a real name.
It's something she made up.

943
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,900
Dotty bought me this.

944
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,200
'Cause she was
worried about me growth.

945
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:40,400
If you need some water,
there's only the sink.

946
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,900
No, thank you.
I had a bath last night.

947
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:51,800
I expect there's a knack to it.

948
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:58,100
It's very intimate, isn't it?

949
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,800
Hello, Mother?

950
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:01,800
I've got something--

951
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:03,900
It's Stella.

952
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:06,400
I've got something to tell you.

953
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,400
Uncle Vernon?

954
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:25,800
I'm in.

955
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:58,400
I'm looking for Mr. Potter
from the-- the theatre.

956
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:12,500
Sorry to intrude,
but I'm impelled to speak.

957
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,200
Oh. My name is Bradshaw.

958
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:19,200
Oh, my God.

959
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:21,300
You're Uncle Vernon.

960
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,200
Delighted!

961
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:54,900
Someone was splashing out
at Woolworths.

962
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:56,600
Quiet, please!

963
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:06,200
Stella's very young
and very impressionable.

964
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:13,000
Well under
the age of carnal consent.

965
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:15,800
I-- I can't be everywhere.

966
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:18,900
It'd look very odd, that-- that.

967
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:25,600
The thing is,
she gets very upset.

968
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:27,900
Do you get very upset?

969
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,900
Ohh. I served in North Africa.

970
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:36,400
I didn't.
I was in the catering corps.

971
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:39,100
Were you very brave?

972
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:47,800
Stella!

973
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:01,400
Coming back?

974
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:04,200
No.

975
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,000
Why not?

976
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:10,700
I just don't want to.

977
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:13,500
Uncle Vernon wouldn't like it.

978
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:44,800
It strikes me clear as day,
she's gone, Lily.

979
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:54,800
What have I--

980
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:57,400
What have we led her in for, eh?

981
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:55,500
No tea for me.

982
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,000
It'll warm you up.

983
01:20:58,100 --> 01:20:59,600
No, it doesn't.

984
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:24,400
You ought to get a proper coat.

985
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:30,000
Auntie Lily bought me a coat.

986
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:32,600
I'd rather die.

987
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:36,900
It's too big
and it's got a fur collar.

988
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:39,200
It sounds glamorous.

989
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:44,700
You have to paint your face
if you wear fur.

990
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:49,500
Cheap goods should be wrapped
in plain brown paper.

991
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:57,800
Who gave you the pearls?

992
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,900
My mother.

993
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:05,800
I'm sorry.

994
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:07,900
I can see they weren't
bought in Woolworths.

995
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:10,300
They probably were.

996
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:15,300
Which is why she left them
on me pillow...

997
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:17,100
twined around a single red rose.

998
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:22,900
What a lovely thing to do.

999
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,800
I'm in love with someone else!

1000
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:38,300
Do you do this with him?

1001
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,900
What's that got to do with it?

1002
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:52,800
Put your legs closer together.

1003
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,200
That feels different.

1004
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:07,900
Put them-- There's--

1005
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,900
Meredith.

1006
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,800
Meredith.

1007
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:32,800
She won't wear the vest
wardrobe has made for her.

1008
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:35,300
I bleed for her.

1009
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:42,500
Bunny's watching.

1010
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:05,500
Here, put those--

1011
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:09,200
The crocodile!

1012
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:10,900
Stella,
this is very dangerous.

1013
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:13,700
I told you.
No real flowers on the stage.

1014
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:15,100
This has nothing to do with me.

1015
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:19,100
And you, Mr. O'Hara,
should know better.

1016
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:31,000
They're made for each other.

1017
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:33,500
Wendy,
you are wrong about mothers!

1018
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:36,700
I thought like you
about the window

1019
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,800
so I stayed away
for moons and moons...

1020
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:41,700
Is Stella bronchial,
by any chance?

1021
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:44,700
Are you crying?

1022
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:50,900
It's-- it's to do with
the low notes in the male voice.

1023
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:55,600
I noticed it first in the army
when music was compulsory.

1024
01:24:56,900 --> 01:24:58,700
Oh, I know.

1025
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:01,200
No. She's got
such a nasty cough.

1026
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:04,900
Bunny's had to put cough drops
in the prompt corner.

1027
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:07,800
We've had her X-rayed.
She's sound as a bell.

1028
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:10,000
I shall let you have
the 3 ha'pence for the sweets.

1029
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,800
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Was it more?

1030
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:16,500
No, no. No,
the reason I'm here is

1031
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:19,600
we're playing football against
the "Treasure Island" cast

1032
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:21,600
on New Year's Day.

1033
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,900
My footy days are over.
Heh. I haven't the wind.

1034
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:28,000
No, no, Uncle Vernon.

1035
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:30,000
I wanted you both
to come and watch.

1036
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:31,900
You know, support us,

1037
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,300
meet some of
Stella's new friends.

1038
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:43,200
I'm beginning to get
the hang of fucking.

1039
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:47,700
Yes.

1040
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:53,800
It's no different from learning
to play the ukulele.

1041
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:55,800
You just need practice.

1042
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:05,100
Don't you love me just a bit?

1043
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:08,000
No.

1044
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,900
I love another.

1045
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:19,500
<i># Oh, I do like to be

1046
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:23,200
<i># Oh, I do like to stroll along

1047

1048
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:27,300
Oh! Sorry.

1049
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:29,200
That's perfectly all right.

1050
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:30,600
<i># Beside the seaside #</i>

1051
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:32,400
Is he one of our pirates
or one of theirs?

1052
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:33,800
One of theirs.

1053
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:35,900
I mean, I think their pirates
are much better

1054
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:38,300
than our pirates,
don't you, Bunny?

1055
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:39,700
Can't you find anywhere to sit?

1056
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:42,500
Bunch up, Bunny.
Geoff-wey can sit between us.

1057
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:43,900
Oh, no, he can't.
He's too chubby.

1058
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:46,200
We need someone slimmer.
John! John Harbour!

1059
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:48,600
You come and sit between us and
Geoff-wey can have your seat.

1060
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:50,500
I'll stand, thank you, Meredith.

1061
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:55,000
I am the wefewee, Geoff-wey,
so just you be careful.

1062
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:56,900
<i># Oh, I do like to be

01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:58,500
Where's that pirate?

<i># Oh, I do like to be

1070
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:34,300
Got it!

1071
01:27:57,400 --> 01:27:59,900
Come on, The Playhouse!
Come on, The Rep!

1072
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:12,000
- Hey, you're not trying.
- I'm trying very hard.

1073
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:13,400
No, you're not.

1074
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,500
- Yay!
- Go, Rep!

1075
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,900
Yeah! Good one!

1076
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,400
Thank you.
I'll let you get away with that.

1077
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:46,800
What?

1078
01:28:57,900 --> 01:28:58,900
Come on, Geoffrey!

1079
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:00,900
- Yeah!
- That's it! Go on!

1080
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:05,400
- Yay!
- You've done it!

1081
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:06,900
Good goal, son!

1082
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,600
Offside.
Surely that was offside.

1083
01:29:10,900 --> 01:29:13,400
Offside. Offside.
Back here.

1084
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:14,600
- What?!
- Offside?!

1085
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:17,000
How could
that have been offside?!

1086
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:19,300
The first thing
an actor must learn

1087
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:20,900
is humility, Geoffrey.
Remember?

1088
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,500
Thank you, John.
I might have missed it.

1089
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:25,200
- Boo! Boo!
- Get some spectacles, Potter!

1090
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:29,000
- Leave it!
- Get off me!

1091
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:30,600
Geoffrey, leave it!

1092
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:32,600
Yes?

1093
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:38,200
Oh, my God!

1094
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:41,000
Geoffrey!

1095
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:45,600
Come on.

1096
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,200
Breathe. You'll feel better.
Just breathe deeply.

1097
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:54,900
My bloody scarf!

1098
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:57,300
He was wearing
my bloody scarf

1099
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:58,900
and he wouldn't even look at me!

1100
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:00,400
You all right?

1101
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:02,800
- I fainted, I think.
- Oh, good God.

1102
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:05,500
I fainted
because the pain was

1103
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,600
very excruciating,
so I did the best thing

1104
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:09,900
I could think of and I fainted.

1105
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:11,000
Get me my coat, Bunny.

1106
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:12,500
Geoffrey's got to go.

1107
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:14,500
Get me my coat, Bunny!

1108
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:20,400
- Mr. Potter.
- Uncle Vernon.

1109
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:23,000
There, there. Shh.

1110
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:24,900
Poor boy.

1111
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:29,800
Desmond!

1112
01:30:29,900 --> 01:30:31,500
All right, all right.

1113
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:34,200
Now, look here,
we were wondering--

1114
01:30:34,300 --> 01:30:35,900
we were all wondering

1115
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:38,200
if you might not have
a word with Potter.

1116
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:39,600
Geoffrey
shouldn't have hit him

1117
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:41,500
but it does seem
a cry for help.

1118
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:43,900
That's right! We all think
it's a cry for help.

1119
01:30:43,900 --> 01:30:45,900
Cry for help, squire-- skipper.

1120
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:48,900
Ah, yes, I see.

1121
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,300
I'll tell the bugger!

1122
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,500
No, Babs.
He'll be awful to you.

1123
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:55,600
Cry for help, old boy.
Yes, yes.

1124
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:58,700
Leave it with you, then.
You were in the navy.

1125
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:01,200
Meredith,
you all right, squire?

1126
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:14,800
No, I don't think one should be
too hard on the lad.

1127
01:31:14,900 --> 01:31:18,400
Geoffrey-- he has been
working very hard.

1128
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:20,160

1129
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:21,900
you are one
of nature's gentlemen.

1130
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:24,400
That's very nice of you,
Uncle Vernon.

1131
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:26,700
I like these days.

1132
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:29,400
Hint of frost.
Touch of sunlight.

1133
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:30,800
Mmm! Invigorating, isn't it?

1134
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:31,900
I always think
on a day like this

1135
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,600
a man can stand up
and face the--

1136
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:38,800
Oh, Christ!

1137
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:41,000
...world.

1138
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
- Oh, God, I--
- Pirates!

1139
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Where's our Stella?
I'm all right.

1140
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,400
I'm all right.
Where's Stella?

1141
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:49,000
Aah! God!

1142
01:31:59,900 --> 01:32:01,400
Good of you to bother.

1143
01:32:04,100 --> 01:32:05,800
Could have waited.

1144
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:15,000
It's to do with
that boy Geoffrey...

1145
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:16,600
You know...

1146
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:18,600
he is a boy.

1147
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:24,200
Hardly more than a child,
really.

1148
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:26,600
Have you seduced him?

1149
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:30,900
Does he think he loves you?

1150
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,900
Are you playing games with him?
I think you are.

1151
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:35,300
I think you're doing
what you did in Windsor.

1152
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:39,300
A much older man, I grant you.

1153
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:43,800
A much sadder man.

1154
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:46,100
Don't need to remind you
that he later hanged himself

1155
01:32:46,100 --> 01:32:48,100
in a police cell, do I?

1156
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:52,500
Ohh...

1157
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:54,600
Nothing to do with you.

1158
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,900
Perhaps.

1159
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:03,500
Look, just drop it.
Leave the boy alone.

1160
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:07,400
The play's about innocence.

1161
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:11,600
Not seduction or exploitation.

1162
01:33:11,900 --> 01:33:13,800
I mean, look at the play, man.

1163
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:17,900
This is awkward for me.

1164
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:22,200
Yes. Isn't it?

1165
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:25,200
I'm not a narrow man

1166
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:28,600
and, God knows,
I'm no saint, but you...

1167
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:30,100
you...

1168
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:32,400
Aren't you going to be off
if you don't hurry?

1169
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:38,800
Here.

1170
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:45,800
Just before you go down
to the nursery, Mr. Darling

1171
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:48,100
don't you think
you ought to remember

1172
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:50,100
that it's also
a criminal offense

1173
01:33:50,100 --> 01:33:52,000
to consort with a minor?

1174
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:55,100
You know...

1175
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:57,400
assault a child?

1176
01:34:06,900 --> 01:34:08,900
- Mr. O'Hara!
- You wouldn't.

1177
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,100
God, I'm off!

1178
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:21,600
Aah!

1179
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:27,700
<i>"Potter, my concern
is for a young man</i>

1180
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:30,900
<i>"whose life may well be ruined
by your attentions.</i>

1181
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:32,600
<i>"If the situ--"</i>

1182
01:34:37,900 --> 01:34:40,500
He's boasting about it
in the prop room!

1183
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:43,300
Stagehand --that one with
the glass eye-- egging him on!

1184
01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:44,900
- Who?
- Geoffrey!

1185
01:34:44,900 --> 01:34:47,000
Why hasn't he been given
the sack?

1186
01:34:47,100 --> 01:34:49,700
- Geoffrey has his reasons.
- He's unbalanced! 

1187
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:51,500
Don't talk rot.

1188
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:53,900
Mr. Potter's a wronged man!

1189
01:34:56,900 --> 01:34:59,900
Mr. Potter has spent his life
harming people like Geoffrey

1190
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:03,200
and causing pain to people
like Bunny who really love him.

1191
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:05,800
Hilary Melville was only 18

1192
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:09,400
when Potter picked him
up at the BBC.

1193
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:12,600
Hilary is a him?

1194
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:17,300
Believe it or not.
Doesn't much matter--

1195
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:19,900
him or her, old or young,
to Meredith.

1196
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:22,100
What he wants is hearts.

1197
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:24,200
You're jealous of him!

1198
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:26,400
Oh.

1199
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:30,700
I'm going
and I'm not coming back.

1200
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:32,900
Not ever.

1201
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:36,700
Oh, for God's sake.
Look, please--

1202
01:35:55,100 --> 01:35:57,300
Kind of you to come.

1203
01:35:57,400 --> 01:35:58,900
I am ashamed.

1204
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,900
I'm at a disadvantage.

1205
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:04,700
It's not broken!

1206
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:07,800
Sprained.

1207
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:09,700
It was me own fault.

1208
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:11,900
I went down
not watching where I was--

1209
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,000
It's Mr. Potter
I feel sorry for.

1210
01:36:15,100 --> 01:36:17,800
I hear he's from a good family,
the lad who butted him.

1211
01:36:17,900 --> 01:36:20,600
So I believe. Is Stella here?

1212
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:23,600
He's not gonna sack the boy?

1213
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:26,100
He too was bothered
about me injury.

1214
01:36:26,100 --> 01:36:27,700
You just missed him.

1215
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:31,500
What did Potter have to say?

1216
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:35,200
He's helping us with Stella,
keeping an eye on her.

1217
01:36:35,300 --> 01:36:37,800
She, of course,
tells us nothing.

1218
01:36:37,900 --> 01:36:41,000
She keeps things locked in,
you know, Stella.

1219
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:43,900
That's why
I got her on the stage

1220
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,800
to help get them out.

1221
01:36:46,900 --> 01:36:48,500
We're all she's got.

1222
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,300
What about her mother?

1223
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:55,600
She talks to her mother
on the phone.

1224
01:36:58,100 --> 01:36:59,900
Did you hear that, Lily?

1225
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,200
The little madam.

1226
01:37:01,900 --> 01:37:04,200
She can't ring her mother.

1227
01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:06,400
She doesn't know where
her mother is.

1228
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:07,500
None of us do.

1229
01:37:07,900 --> 01:37:10,700
America, we think.

1230
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,600
What I am about to tell you
may put us in a bad light.

1231
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:25,100
We threw her out,
Stella's mother.

1232
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:27,600
Our Renée.

1233
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:28,900
Not at first

1234
01:37:28,900 --> 01:37:32,000
when she came back
from London. Not then.

1235
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:33,100
Going out...

1236
01:37:33,900 --> 01:37:37,600
staying out all night on more
than one occasion-- occasion.

1237
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:40,700
She was young, Vernon.
She wanted a bit of life.

1238
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:45,000
It was-- it was
before the war, of course.

1239
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:51,400
She came back when the baby
was born-- our Stella.

1240
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:56,200
But she went off again.

1241
01:37:56,300 --> 01:37:58,600
Got herself
a room in a house

1242
01:37:58,700 --> 01:38:01,700
around the corner
in Percy Street.

1243
01:38:01,900 --> 01:38:05,500
Artists and suchlike.

1244
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:07,100
She got herself a job.

1245
01:38:07,100 --> 01:38:10,900
A telephonist at the GPO.
Quite successful.

1246
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,400
Successful.

1247
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:16,200
But she-- she couldn't stop it.

1248
01:38:16,300 --> 01:38:19,700
Dollin' herself up
and going out.

1249
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:23,900
The neighbours told us.
They told us.

1250
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:29,400
There she was, little Stella...

1251
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:32,600
left alone in that basement...

1252
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:34,500
in a cot...

1253
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:38,300
with a row of nightlights
along the floor.

1254
01:38:38,300 --> 01:38:40,600
A baby.

1255
01:38:50,700 --> 01:38:54,400
And our Renée? Not sure.

1256
01:38:56,900 --> 01:38:59,800
She left a rose on her pillow.

1257
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:01,600
Withered, of course.

1258
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,300
Place stank of turps.

1259
01:39:10,900 --> 01:39:13,200
Could have been a conflagration.

1260
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:20,100
There have been times...

1261
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:28,900
there were times

1262
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,900
I was close to death.

1263
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:37,900
I knew it. Felt it.

1264
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:45,000
And what I thought was...

1265
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:50,800
I have a son...

1266
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:56,400
and it will not be
the end of me.

1267
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:02,800
But it is.

1268
01:40:06,700 --> 01:40:12,400
I may not face it as well
as I did death.

1269
01:40:36,900 --> 01:40:39,800
Stella!

1270
01:40:41,900 --> 01:40:44,400
Stella Maris!

1271
01:40:48,100 --> 01:40:49,800
Aah!

1272
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:44,900
Now is the hour

1273
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,600
when children
in their homes are abed.

1274
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:49,100
Their lips bright-browned

1275
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:51,300
with the good-night chocolate

1276
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:52,900
and their tongues
drowsily searching

1277
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,700
for belated crumbs
housed insecurely

1278
01:43:55,800 --> 01:43:57,600
on their shining cheeks.

1279
01:43:59,700 --> 01:44:00,900
Compare with them
the children

1280
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,300
on this boat
about to walk the plank!

1281
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:06,800
Split my infinitives

1282
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:11,200
but 'tis my hour of triumph!

1283
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:22,800
All right.

1284
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:24,300
Right.

1285
01:44:31,700 --> 01:44:33,900
<i>"Potter,
it may be that you think</i>

1286
01:44:33,900 --> 01:44:36,100
<i>"my association
with a certain person</i>

1287
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:39,100
<i>"will prevent me from doing

1288
01:44:39,100 --> 01:44:42,100

1291
01:44:54,900 --> 01:44:56,900
Excuse me, sir.

1292
01:44:56,900 --> 01:44:58,500
Are you the stage manager?

1293
01:44:59,900 --> 01:45:03,900
Yes. I am.

1294
01:45:07,900 --> 01:45:10,600
Our Stella's been a brick.

1295
01:45:10,700 --> 01:45:13,700
She cradled me head, you know.

1296
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:16,300
But she's been telling
her fibs again.

1297
01:45:16,900 --> 01:45:19,800
Like mother, like daughter.

1298
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:22,600
Renée wasn't all bad.

1299
01:45:22,700 --> 01:45:25,000
She won that competition
to be the speaking clock

1300
01:45:25,100 --> 01:45:26,900
out of the whole of England.

1301
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:30,000
"The girl
with the golden voice."

1302
01:45:30,100 --> 01:45:32,200
No, I'm out of 'em.

1303
01:45:32,300 --> 01:45:35,000
Will you take a substitute?

1304
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:39,200
There is no substitute
for the real thing.

1305
01:45:50,700 --> 01:45:53,600
Tink! Dear Tink!

1306
01:45:53,700 --> 01:45:57,200
Are you dying?!

1307
01:45:58,300 --> 01:46:00,400
Captain Hook's drowned himself.

1308
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:01,600
What do you mean?

1309
01:46:01,700 --> 01:46:03,200
Her light grows faint

1310
01:46:03,300 --> 01:46:07,400
and if that goes out,
it means she is dead!

1311
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:09,000
Her voice is so low

1312
01:46:09,100 --> 01:46:11,800
I can scarcely hear
what she is saying!

1313
01:46:11,900 --> 01:46:14,900
He's dead.
Drowned himself, yes.

1314
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:17,600
She says...

1315
01:46:17,700 --> 01:46:20,800
She says she thinks
she could get well again

1316
01:46:20,900 --> 01:46:26,100
if children believe in fairies!

1317
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:28,700
Do you believe in fairies?

1318
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:32,400
Say it quick! That you believe!

1319
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:35,600
If you believe in fairies,
clap your hands!

1320
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:39,800
Oh, children, clap your hands
and Tinkerbell will live!

1321
01:46:40,900 --> 01:46:44,700
If you believe in fairies,
children, clap your hands!

1322
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:46,600
Louder! Louder!

1323
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:51,800
Oh, clap your hands
and Tinkerbell will live!

1324
01:47:04,900 --> 01:47:06,900
Be a good girl, now.

1325
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:08,900
It's all right. It's all right.

1326
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,900
You be a good girl
and I'll be back soon.

1327
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,900
I'll be just a minute.
Don't worry.

1328
01:47:59,900 --> 01:48:02,600
The thing is...

1329
01:48:02,700 --> 01:48:04,000
I don't suppose

1330
01:48:04,100 --> 01:48:06,300
we can keep it
out of the papers, Rose.

1331
01:48:06,300 --> 01:48:09,200
I could, but I won't.

1332
01:48:09,300 --> 01:48:13,200
God forgive me,
but it'll be good for business.

1333
01:48:29,900 --> 01:48:32,200
It's been awful.

1334
01:48:32,300 --> 01:48:35,600
I haven't dared phone you.

1335
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:39,300
There was
this man who seduced me.

1336
01:48:39,300 --> 01:48:41,300
It wasn't my fault.

1337
01:48:42,900 --> 01:48:44,800
<i>"At the third stroke...</i>

1338
01:48:44,900 --> 01:48:48,600
<i>"the time will be
10:47 and 20 seconds."</i>

1339
01:48:48,700 --> 01:48:53,000
I'm learning, Mother.
I'm just...

1340
01:48:53,100 --> 01:48:56,500
bending down to tie a shoe lace.

1341
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:59,900
<i>"...10:47 and 30 seconds."</i>

1342
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,400
And everyone is waiting
round the corner.

1343
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:10,000
<i>"...the time will be
10:47 and 40 seconds."</i>

1344
01:49:12,900 --> 01:49:14,800
<i>"At the third stroke...</i>

1345
01:49:14,900 --> 01:49:20,000
<i>"the time will be
10:47 and 50 seconds."</i>

1346
01:49:21,305 --> 01:49:27,468
