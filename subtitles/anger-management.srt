00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,200
Hey, Timmy, get me a hot dog.

3
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,900
Hey, Dave.
I like your Dukes of Hazzard T-shirt.

4
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,300
Thanks, Sara.
I like your CHiPs T-shirt.

5
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,700
-Thanks.
-Fun party, huh?

6
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,500
Yeah. Except for Arnie Shankman being here.

7
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,800
Wedgie! Wedgie! Wedgie!

8
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,300
You know, I kinda feel bad for him
with his sister losing her mind and all.

9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,200
Whatever.

10
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,400
You know what we should do?
Play Truth or Dare.

11
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,000
-You want to?
-Sure.

12
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,900
Okay, I'll go first.
Truth or dare?

13
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,600
Truth.

14
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,900
Have you ever kissed a girl before?

15
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,500
-Well, I--
-Family doesn't count.

16
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,800
-Maybe I'll take dare.
-Okay.

17
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,600
I dare you to kiss me.

18
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,200
Right here?

19
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:08,100
Yeah. I want everyone to see
that your first kiss is with me.

20
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,800
Got any mustard for that
cocktail frank, butt-lick?

21
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,100
-David Buznik.
-I just landed in St. Louis.

22
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,800
-I hope you wrote my speech.
-I did, sir. I pulled an all nighter.

23
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,000
I look forward to this, Mr. Head.
Never been to St. Louis.

24
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,400
Thank you for allowing me
to come on this trip--

25
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,200
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, that sounds great.

26
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,100
If we finish our work,
I'd love to go to a jazz club.

27
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,500
Terrific.

28
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,600
-He hung up on you again, didn't he?
-Yes. Yes, he did.

29
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,400
He's a jerk. You came up with the idea
for the Husky Cat clothing line.

30
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,400
He didn't say thank you.
He should give you a promotion.

31
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,600
There's a creative executive position
that just opened up, so...

32
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,900
Bring that up on the trip.
You gotta stick up for yourself.

33
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,600
I know. I'll figure something out.

34
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,500
I gotta go. Sorry.

35
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,600
I'm gonna miss you.

36
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,400
That guy's looking at us.

37
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,300
You know I don't like it when
people watch me kiss.

38
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,700
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,100
Take care.

40
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,300
Okay. Bye.

41
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,200
Dave...

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,500
-Have a good flight.
-Okay.

43
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,700
I'm sorry.

44
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,800
I think you're in my seat.

45
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,900
Come on, pal. I'm already settled in
here. Can't you sit somewhere else?

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,600
You're supposed to sit in the seat
they assigned you.

47
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,400
Nobody cares. Just sit in the seat
I'm supposed to sit in.

48
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,500
Excuse me. This seat's available.

49
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,200
Okay. Thank you.

50
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,200
You're very welcome.

51
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,500
No air.

52
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,300
That's too bad, huh?

53
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,700
You're on my side of the armrest.

54
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,600
We're not gonna have problems,
are we?

55
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,700
No.

56
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,800
I'm wetting my Jockeys here.

57
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,800
You gotta get a load of this, keed.

58
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,800
I mean, you like comedies?

59
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,500
I just haven't been sleeping a lot
lately so I was trying to catch some...

60
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,300
Look at this actress here.

61
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,100
What is your position
on breast implants?

62
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,900
This guy.

63
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,700
I can just watch the movie with you.

64
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,800
Excuse me.

65
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,500
-Could I get a headset?
-Certainly.

66
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,800
Thank you.

67
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,400
Probably make out
with my next boyfriend.

68
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,000
Oh, my God, it was disgusting.

69
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,800
Miss?

70
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,700
I'll be right there, sir.

71
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,200
Where's your headset?

72
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,500
She's busy right now,
but it's coming.

73
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,400
For crying out loud. You're missing
important plot points.

74
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,900
Ma'am?

75
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,600
Could you give me a second, sir?

76
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,000
Excuse me.

77
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,400
Could I maybe get that headset,
please?

78
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,200
-Do not raise your voice to me, sir.
-I wasn't raising my voice.

79
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,400
Just calm down.

80
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,500
I am calm.
I just want my headset.

81
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,200
Our country is going through
a difficult time now.

82
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,900
If you won't cooperate--

83
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,500
I don't know where a headset
ties into patriotism.

84
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,100
Is there a problem here, sir?

85
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,600
I don't think so.

86
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,800
Can you come to the back with me
so we can have a talk?

87
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,000
A talk about what?
There's not a problem.

88
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,800
-The stewardess just keeps--
-Flight attendant.

89
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,400
The flight attendant keeps
ignoring me when--

90
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,600
Calm down.

91
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,700
I am calm.
What is it with you people?

92
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,700
"You people"?

93
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,300
Now wait a minute.

94
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,100
I don't mean you people.
I mean you people.

95
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,100
I will not tolerate any racist
behavior on the plane.

96
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,400
This is a difficult time
for our country.

97
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,300
I'm not a racist.
I just want to watch the movie.

98
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm only going to say this
one more time, sir. Calm down.

99
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,400
I'm calm!

100
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,200
All rise.

101
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,400
-What do you think?
-Not guilty. It's a no-brainer.

102
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:26,100
Mr. Buznik. In case 723, assault and
battery against a flight attendant...

103
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,700
...I find you guilty.

104
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,700
I'm ordering you to pay a fine
of $3500.

105
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,000
Thank God you're okay.

106
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,000
In addition, to prevent
further acts of rage...

107
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:43,300
...this court orders you to undergo 20
hours of anger management therapy.

108
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,100
Anger management?

109
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,300
Oh, my goodness. Bobby Knight.

110
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,500
-You're in this group?
-Oh, yeah. This is my first day.

111
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,100
-It's my first day also.
-I hope this class cures me.

112
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,500
Working on the anger problem?

113
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,300
Anger? Isn't this
Sexaholics Anonymous?

114
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,700
No. I think that's down the hall.

115
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,100
Well, the hell with this!
I'm going home!

116
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,800
Dr. Rydell?

117
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,500
You don't remember me, do you?

118
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:55,000
-I sat next to you on the plane.
-Oh, yeah, the headset guy.

119
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,300
-Good to see you again.
-Good to see you too.

120
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,700
That was a crazy flight.

121
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,500
They actually sentenced me
to anger management for that.

122
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,800
Really?

123
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,500
Wow.

124
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,200
This is incredible.
You could sign this for me...

125
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,100
...and tell them I don't have
an anger problem if you want.

126
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,600
I can't just sign your papers.

127
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,700
I didn't do anything wrong.
You know that.

128
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,000
All right.

129
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,700
How's this?

130
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,300
Just hang for one session...

131
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,000
...so I can at least say
I gave you a proper analysis.

132
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,200
-Then I'll sign your papers.
-Okay.

133
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,300
-Shall we?
-Oh, yes. Yes.

134
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:37,600
So my boss, he was talking to me
about how many sick days I've taken.

135
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,400
So my boss, he was talking to me
about how many sick days I've taken.

136
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,000
And I was like, you know,
"Don't go there."

137
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,900
But he kept on about wanting to see
a doctor's note or something.

138
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,800
And I said, "Look, I'm seriously
serious. You don't want to go there."

139
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,500
But he kept talking and talking,
being such a nag...

140
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,000
...and then I just blacked out.

141
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,300
I blacked out.

142
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,100
And when I woke up, I was standing
over him and I was screaming:

143
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,000
"I told you not to go there!
I told you not to go there!"

144
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,700
How do you feel you
handled that situation?

145
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,000
Not as well as I could've.

146
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,500
Remember, Lou, temper's the one
thing you can't get rid of by losing it.

147
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,200
Now, Fury Fighters,
let's say hello to someone...

148
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,500
...who's joining our quest to get
the anger monkeys off our backs:

149
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,700
-Dave.
-Hi, Dave.

150
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,900
Hi.

151
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,300
Good news, I fed my anger monkey
a banana this morning...

152
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,800
...and he's feeling much better.

153
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,100
More good news, you won't have to
listen to those lame jokes...

154
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,300
...because I'm only here
for one session.

155
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,700
Dave assaulted a female
flight attendant in midair.

156
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,300
-Nice.
-I bet you beat her good.

157
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,900
I didn't beat anybody.
I touched a woman.

158
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,100
Liar. Bullshitter.
You're a woman beater.

159
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,200
You can't admit it because
you're a piece of garbage.

160
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,700
I don't know about all that, but
now I understand why you're here.

161
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,800
I'm here because I was verbally
attacked by my neighbor.

162
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,500
And I took a dump on his porch.

163
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,400
I guess you're better than me.
That's why you can't cop to your rage.

164
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,200
You're superior. He's superior.

165
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,400
-Maybe Dave's not ready yet, Chuck.
-You're not ready. Hear what he said?

166
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,000
Let's introduce Dave
to some of the rest of us.

167
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,000
Girls, why don't you tell Dave
what brought you here.

168
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm sure he'd love to listen
to what you guys have to say.

169
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,600
We always do.

170
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,200
-Come on, Dave. Join us.
-Okay.

171
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,100
Okay. Well, we're
in the adult film industry.

172
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,400
And we're lovers.

173
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,600
One day, Gina was having sex
with this Filipino guy Melo...

174
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,000
-...which was cool, it was in the script.
-Sure.

175
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,500
And then I asked Melo
back to the house with us...

176
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,400
...which is cool, because,
well, we like a little variety.

177
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,000
Variety's good.

178
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,800
So anyway, in the middle
of our session...

179
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,900
...I look up and I see Gina
kissing Melo on the mouth...

180
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,700
...which is not cool because it
violates our threesome code of ethics.

181
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,200
-Stacy bit my toe off.
-Then Melo freaks out...

182
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,900
-...and calls me a crazy skank.
-Nobody talks to my bitch that way.

183
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,900
-So I stapled his lips shut.
-Here we are.

184
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,400
Well, we've all been there.

185
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,700
-I like him.
-Yeah, he's funny.

186
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,800
Not as funny as you.

187
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,600
I like that.

188
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,300
-All right, girls.
-Let it go. Let it go a little bit longer.

189
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,900
Walk it off.

190
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,300
Nate. Didn't we decide that you
shouldn't listen to the ball game?

191
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,000
Don't worry, Dr. B, it's just a
regular season game. Not important.

192
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,900
He missed the lay-up!

193
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,300
See? Iverson just missed a lay-up
at the buzzer, Sixers lose.

194
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,000
Who gives a crap, huh?

195
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,000
I mean, it's just a silly game,
anyways.

196
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,200
The anger sharks are swimming
in my head.

197
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,100
You gotta dunk that shit!

198
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,400
You gotta dunk that shit!

199
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,500
Listen to me. Stay with me, Nate.

200
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,800
Now, repeat after me, Nate:

201
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,000
Goosfraba.

202
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,000
Goos blah blah.

203
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,700
Not "blah blah," Nate.

204
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,400
Goosfraba.

205
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,200
Goosfraba.

206
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,200
That's good. Slower.

207
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,000
Goosfraba.

208
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,800
How do you feel?

209
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,000
Better.

210
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,200
Good job, Nate.

211
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,000
That sound is a derivation
of an old Eskimo word...

212
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,600
...that mothers used to calm
their children.

213
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,800
-I see.
-Eskimos seem nice.

214
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,800
-They do.
-I think Eskimos are smug.

215
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,900
Hold that thought, Chuck.

216
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,600
So, Dave...

217
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,600
...tell us about yourself.

218
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,200
Who are you?

219
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,100
Well, I am an executive assistant...

220
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,800
...at a major pet products company.

221
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,800
I don't want you to tell us what you do.
I want you to tell us who you are.

222
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,900
All right.

223
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,200
I'm a pretty good guy.

224
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,200
I like playing tennis on occasion...

225
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,600
Also, not your hobbies, Dave,
just simple:

226
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,500
Tell us who you are.

227
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,900
I just...

228
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,300
Maybe you could give me an example
of what a good answer would be.

229
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,100
What did you say?

230
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,300
You want Lou to tell you who you are?

231
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,000
No, I just...

232
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,200
I'm a nice, easygoing man.

233
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,700
I might be a little bit
indecisive at times.

234
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,200
Dave, you're describing
your personality.

235
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,000
I want to know...

236
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,000
-...who you are.
-What the hell do you want me to say?

237
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,400
I mean, I'm sorry. I just...
I want to answer your question.

238
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,700
I'm just not doing it right, I guess.

239
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,700
I think we're getting a picture, Dave.

240
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,800
-Let's move on.
-Dr. Rydell, I'd like to know something.

241
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,100
Why is it that Chuck
thinks he can smoke?

242
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:26,400
I do whatever I want when I want,
you little Spanish fruit topping.

243
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,700
Honey, at least I didn't
make my aunt pregnant.

244
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,200
What are you laughing at, Dave?

245
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,700
Just laughing. I don't know.
I'm not laughing at you.

246
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:43,100
Were you laughing with me?
Because I'm not laughing.

247
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,900
Am I out of line,
or is this guy pushing me?

248
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,000
Well, how do you feel, Chuck?

249
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,600
I went from happy to angry, skipped
sad. Now I feel like kicking his ass.

250
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,100
Then we'll see who's laughing.

251
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,500
What? Think you're better than me
because you've got both your nuts?

252
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,500
All right, man. All right. Come on.
Come on, big boy. Pretty boy.

253
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,900
All right. Is it worth going back
to the penitentiary, Chuck?

254
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,400
-So he's laughing at you.
-I'm not laughing at him.

255
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,800
Goosfraba.

256
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,900
-Goosfraba.
-Okay.

257
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,800
Good job, Chuck.
That was really good.

258
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,900
Where's the coffee cake?
I was looking forward to it.

259
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,400
Where's the coffee cake?
I was looking forward to it.

260
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,300
I haven't been to the Actors Studio
in quite some time.

261
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,400
-I'm sure your audition will go well.
-Thanks. I hope so.

262
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,700
-Good night.
-All right.

263
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,200
-Thanks, Buddy.
-Bye-bye.

264
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,500
That was a little bit insane.

265
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,000
If I had to do 20 hours of that,
I'd end up killing myself.

266
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,100
Here you go.

267
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,300
Twenty hours in my class
would be pointless for you.

268
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,900
I agree.

269
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,400
I think I'm going to recommend
to the court that we double your time.

270
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,300
What do you mean?

271
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,000
Let me explain something.

272
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,200
There are two kinds of angry people:
explosive and implosive.

273
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,200
Explosive is the kind of individual that
you see screaming at the cashier...

274
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,200
...for not taking their coupons.

275
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,200
Implosive is the cashier
who remains quiet, day after day...

276
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,800
...and finally shoots everyone
in the store.

277
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,700
You're the cashier.

278
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:27,700
No. I'm the guy hiding in the frozen
food section dialing 911, I swear.

279
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm going to assign you an anger ally...

280
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,700
...to help calm you down
when you're losing it.

281
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,100
Chuck.

282
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,000
Not Chuck. Give me Bobby Knight,
or the porno girls.

283
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,000
Heard we're partnering up, huh?

284
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,800
-Yes.
-Here's my number.

285
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,600
Great. "You're going to die, bitch."

286
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,600
Oops, that's a letter I'm writing
to Geraldo Rivera.

287
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,300
-I see.
-My bad. Here.

288
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,100
That's the number. Good. Thank you.

289
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,500
Dave and Chuck...

290
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,000
...working together as a team.

291
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,700
-It's a win-win situation.
-Yeah, feels it.

292
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,700
Dave's particulars.

293
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,900
I'll see you soon.

294
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,500
The Yanks are great this season.

295
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,100
Dave thinks they could beat
Seattle's win record.

296
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,800
Remember at Brown when we
saw Ron Guidry win his 20th?

297
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,700
Oh, man.
He was on fire that year.

298
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,000
We could've been too.

299
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,500
Andrew, don't start or I can't
hang out with you anymore.

300
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,700
Sorry, it's just hard. I'll never
meet anyone as good as you.

301
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,800
You will.
She'll be a very lucky lady.

302
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,700
Thanks for being my best friend.

303
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,500
Linda.

304
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,800
-Hey, Dave.
-Andrew.

305
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,200
Good to see you guys hugging.

306
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,300
How was the doctor?

307
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,500
Psychotic.

308
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,300
Well, did you get any good
promotion news from Mr. Head?

309
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,100
I wasn't able to talk to him
about that yet, but I will.

310
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,700
Not that crowded here.
You'd think it would be packed.

311
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,000
I rented the place. I figured it'd be
more fun if it was just Brown alumni.

312
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,700
Where'd you go to college again?

313
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,800
Trenton Community College.

314
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,800
You had a hard day.
Let me buy you a milk shake.

315
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,700
Later, Andrew.

316
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,300
--once you cast your line in,
so during retrieval...

317
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,900
...it'll help you to create
a realistic and a erratic...

318
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,100
Hey, Dave.

319
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,800
-Hey. Andrew, what's up?
-Not much.

320
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,800
You always try to simulate live bait.

321
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,300
Okay, they got fishing while you
go to the bathroom. That's nice.

322
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,200
Yep. Bass fishing.
Hey, he caught one.

323
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,200
Be aware of your presentation...

324
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,100
...and make sure that,
as you work it along...

325
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,700
Oh, yeah.

326
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,900
Congratulations.

327
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,700
Now that is a big one, folks.

328
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,600
Always a blast being with your friends.

329
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,200
It was a great night.

330
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,400
Yankees winning, beer and hot dogs.

331
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,000
Yeah, you like those foot-long
hot dogs, don't you?

332
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:19,700
So I saw your boy Andrew
at the urinal.

333
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,500
Saw his...

334
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,400
-...thing.
-You were looking?

335
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,400
Yeah, unfortunately.

336
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:31,100
So, now, did this guy grow up near
a nuclear power plant or something?

337
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,000
What are you talking about?

338
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:37,500
Never really seen nothing like that
before. Didn't it used to scare you?

339
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,200
I never saw it.

340
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,700
You never saw it?

341
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,600
No, I told you, I never slept
with him. Why, is it huge?

342
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,900
No. No. No. No.

343
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,500
It's actually quite petite.

344
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,800
I felt bad for him.

345
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,100
It looked like it belonged on
a baby and it had a funny color.

346
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,400
I bet he got a lot of snickers
in the locker room.

347
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,600
Like, "What the hell's that thing?"

348
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,100
When you're in a locker room,
you must feel good about yourself.

349
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:11,100
I do. If there are 20 naked guys
in there, I'm usually in the top 18.

350
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,800
-Which isn't bad.
-You're doing really good.

351
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,300
Thanks.

352
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,900
-Who's that?
-I don't know. Let me get rid of them.

353
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,800
-Hello?
-Dave, it's me, Chuck.

354
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,600
-Who's Chuck?
-Your anger ally.

355
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,500
I'm in a mood, Dave. A bad mood.

356
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,100
A very bad mood.

357
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:38,400
I was fired from my ice-cream truck job
today. No more Fudgeicles.

358
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,900
-What's an anger ally?
-Who's that?

359
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,900
She making fun of me?

360
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,500
No. That's my girlfriend.

361
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,000
You tell her to put a sock in it because
I need to talk to you right now!

362
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,200
We're a little busy right now.

363
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,400
You're busy? We're all busy, okay?

364
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,400
You come down here before
a black wolf swallows my brain!

365
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,300
After I got kicked out of the Army,
I went through a real bad time:

366
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:16,100
Hookers, booze, shooting holes in the
ceiling, screaming myself to sleep.

367
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,700
Finally, my parents said I
had to move out.

368
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,300
I'm guessing that's when you
decided to shack up with your aunt.

369
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,800
Don't get cute, wiseass!

370
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,500
But, yes.

371
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
What's with the watch, huh?
Am I boring you?

372
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,100
We ordered the drinks 15 minutes ago
and I kind of gotta get back.

373
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,300
Miss? Excuse me, miss?

374
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,300
Is this
Slow And Stupid Waitress Day?

375
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,700
I'm sorry. I be right with you.

376
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:47,200
Damn, man, reminds me
of these chicks back in the war.

377
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,200
Would give you the old licky-licky,
then fry your banana.

378
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,500
Settle.

379
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,100
I have seen some shit, man.
I kid you not, I have seen some shit.

380
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,300
Wake up to the sound
of kids screaming.

381
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,600
Explosions everywhere.

382
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,600
Never know when your number's up.

383
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,600
Vietnam, huh?

384
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,700
-Grenada, man.
-Grenada?

385
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,300
Wasn't that like 12 hours long?

386
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,600
Did you see that?

387
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:25,800
-See what?
-That guy. He just gave me a look.

388
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,800
He didn't give you a look.

389
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:33,500
And I'm pretty sure I heard him mutter
some kind of anti-Semitic remark.

390
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,800
Are you Jewish?

391
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,000
I could be. But, no. Half Irish,
half Italian, half Mexican.

392
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,700
Let's go give those guys some tsuris.

393
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,300
Well, the guy on the left
is blind, Chuck.

394
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,300
I hear you.

395
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,100
He's yours.

396
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,600
No. That's not what I was saying.

397
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,500
-Hey.
-What the hell?

398
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,300
Got something against guys
with hair?

399
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,100
What's going on?

400
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,500
Don't! Stop it! Stop!

401
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,600
Stop! Goosfraba!

402
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,500
You piece of shit!

403
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,700
Stop it! Stop it!

404
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,700
Welcome back, Mr. Buznik.

405
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:28,700
I see you've managed to brutalize
a cocktail waitress this time.

406
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,700
I guess beating up stewardesses
can get old after a while.

407
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,900
Flight attendant, Your Honor.

408
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,100
I didn't hit her on purpose,
Your Honor.

409
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,300
I was being attacked by someone...

410
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,100
...and while I was
trying to take away his...

411
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,800
His...

412
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,800
Trying to take away my cane,
Your Honor.

413
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,000
You cracked a waitress in the face...

414
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,800
...while attempting to steal
a blind man's cane?

415
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:59,100
Your Honor, we're not even sure
how blind this man really is.

416
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,500
Okay. My bad. Moving on.

417
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,000
Happy now, ass-wipe?

418
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,600
Mr. Buznik, I don't know
why you hate women.

419
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,500
Maybe you don't know either...

420
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:20,700
...but I'll let you think about it while
you spend one year in a state prison.

421
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,700
-Isn't that a bit harsh, Your Honor?
-No!

422
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Okay.

423
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,200
-May I approach, Your Honor?
-By all means, Dr. Rydell.

424
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,600
Thank you.

425
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,000
-It's been a while.
-Yes, it has.

426
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,000
-You look marvelous, Brenda.
-Thank you.

427
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,700
-And how are the boys?
-Fantastic.

428
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,800
James made the basketball team,
Raheem landed the lead...

429
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,500
...in Fiddler on the Roof.

430
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,200
Raheem will make
a breathtaking Tevye, I'm sure.

431
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,800
So do you have a take
on this Buznik guy?

432
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,800
Is this good or bad?

433
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,900
Well, it's bad that he's
talking to her...

434
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,100
...but it's good that...

435
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,700
No, it's bad. It's all bad.

436
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,600
-You think you can help him?
-I think so, Your Honor.

437
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:22,900
If I can't, I'll tear him apart
with my bare hands.

438
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,800
Mr. Buznik...

439
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,400
...because of the enormous respect
I have for Dr. Rydell...

440
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,600
...I'm placing you in his intensive
anger management program...

441
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,200
...for 30 days.

442
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,500
But if you fail to strictly adhere
to the rules of his program...

443
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,900
...you will spend the next year
in state prison.

444
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,400
-Buddy?
-Good evening. Ready to get it on?

445
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,200
Get what on?
What are you doing here?

446
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,000
Well, well, well.

447
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,300
The lair of the rage rhino.

448
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,600
I smell the effluvium
of pain and frustration.

449
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,900
-Where should we put my stuff?
-What stuff?

450
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,800
We've got 30 days
to control your anger.

451
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,800
My approach dictates
intense observation.

452
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,600
What better vantage point
than bunkmates?

453
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,500
Put that there, Dan,
thank you very much.

454
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:31,000
No. No. I'm sorry. Guys, I don't think
you should be moving in with me.

455
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,700
Sit down, Dave.

456
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,700
Let's be perfectly clear about this.

457
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,200
You've been deemed
a threat to society.

458
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,700
I believe that radical,
round-the-clock therapy...

459
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,000
...is the only way to effect
a meaningful and positive change...

460
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,200
...in your behavior.

461
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,500
Now we can do it here
or Rikers Island.

462
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,000
-Anything else, Dr. B?
-No thanks, Dan.

463
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,500
We'll install the wiretaps
tomorrow.

464
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,900
Wiretaps?

465
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,500
-Is this your CD collection?
-Yes.

466
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,600
Oh, my.

467
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,200
What are you doing?

468
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,400
I don't want you listening
to any angry music.

469
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,100
The Carpenters are angry?
I mean...

470
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,300
Don't be naive, Dave.

471
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,400
"Close to You."
"We've Only Just Begun."

472
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,300
Songs of madness and obsession.

473
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,300
Who's going to pay for that?

474
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:25,500
Retard your anger level a few notches
and listen to me. Can you do that?

475
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,700
Yeah. It's retarded. I'm retarded.

476
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,900
Good.

477
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:34,700
Now then, we need to go over
some ground rules.

478
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,700
My girlfriend got me that.

479
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,800
You're to refrain from violent acts
including verbal assault...

480
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,400
...and vulgar hand gestures.

481
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,400
You may not use rage-enhancing
substances...

482
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:53,300
...such as caffeine, nicotine, alcohol,
crack cocaine...

483
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,100
...Slippy-Flippies, Jelly Stingers,
Trick Sticks...

484
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,000
...Bing Bangs or Flying Willards.

485
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,400
-How about Fiddle Faddles?
-Under my supervision.

486
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,100
Also, if you are unable
to stop masturbating...

487
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,900
...please do so without the use
of any pornographic images...

488
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,700
...depicting quote-unquote
"angry sex."

489
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:15,400
That having been said,
I'm a pretty good guy...

490
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,500
...and I think you'll be
pleasantly surprised...

491
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,600
...at how much fun we can have.

492
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:24,300
Jeez, without Slippy-Flippies or angry
masturbating? How is that possible?

493
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:28,500
Sarcasm is anger's ugly cousin.
From now on, unacceptable.

494
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,400
Dave, I got this for you.

495
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,100
It's a wonderfully therapeutic tool.

496
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,600
Record your thoughts on this
whenever you feel angry.

497
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,600
I'm feeling very angry right now...

498
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,800
...because I only have one bed
and no couch.

499
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,600
Not a problem.

500
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:53,200
In Europe, it's not considered unusual
for three or four men to share a bed.

501
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,900
Yeah, well, that's why I'm
proud to be an American.

502
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,600
By the way...

503
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,400
I like to sleep in the nude.

504
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,600
You hear that frog?

505
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,300
Nope.

506
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,100
What do you want?

507
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,500
I'm just recording your demeanor
upon awakening.

508
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:14,300
Good to see you got your
underwear back on.

509
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,000
6:30?

510
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,400
I don't gotta be up till 7.

511
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,800
You've got to make my breakfast.

512
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,500
Dave, cooking is very relaxing
and therapeutic.

513
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,400
I want two eggs,
over easy and unfertilized...

514
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,100
...wheat toast, dry, and please...

515
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,700
...tell me you've got ketchup.

516
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
There's a Denny's down the street.

517
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,600
Not only do they have ketchup...

518
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,300
...but they got the angriest
waitresses I've seen.

519
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,800
You could have a blast with
the goosfraba thing down there.

520
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,200
Lame-o.

521
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,700
Your eggs.

522
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:20,000
-Holy shit!
-I said over easy!!

523
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,300
Now, why did I do that?

524
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,500
Because I refused to spoon with you
last night?

525
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,100
The angry man opens his mouth
and shuts his eyes.

526
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,000
Alpha-Bits.

527
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,500
No matter how old I get,
always a culinary delight.

528
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:47,200
No explanation for the egg throwing.
He's a psycho.

529
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:51,100
Don't sulk, Dave. Eat. Sit down.

530
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,800
We'll be off to work in a jiffy.

531
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:59,200
"We'll be off to work." Now, by "we'll,"
I assume you mean just me, right?

532
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,900
Well, I have to join you at work.

533
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,500
Full contact.

534
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:07,400
That will make me look nuts, Buddy,
bringing a shrink to work...

535
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,900
...you whipping eggs at people.
I don't know.

536
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:14,300
You must never be ashamed that you
sought help for yourself, Dave.

537
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,200
It's not a weakness.

538
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,700
I mean, I gotta be there by 9:00.

539
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,900
I don't think we'll make it on time.
You're not even dressed.

540
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:27,100
The Talmud says:
"Wherever you look...

541
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,500
...there's something to be seen."

542
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,300
Look, Dave.

543
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,500
-What exactly was that all about?
-What?

544
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,300
You just ran through a red light.
Are you trying to get us both killed?

545
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,900
I'm a little flustered right now.
I have to be to work in eight minutes.

546
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,200
Flustered?

547
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,900
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, man!

548
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,100
-Holy shit! What are you doing?
-I need you to unfluster.

549
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,900
My boss is going to go nuts on me
if we're late, so please?

550
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,400
We will proceed when you
are centered.

551
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,000
I'm centered, I'm centered.

552
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,500
There's 10,000 people behind us.
Let's go, crazy man.

553
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,200
What is that? Is that good?

554
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,200
We're going to sing a song.

555
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,700
No. I don't want to sing a song.
I want to go to... I've gotta go.

556
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,000
Here we go.

557
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,700
The magic of Leonard Bernstein
and Stephen Sondheim's...

558
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,500
...West Side Story.

559
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,800
"I Feel Pretty."

560
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,200
Get this moving.
What the hell's your problem?

561
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,000
Shut your pie-hole!
We're working here!

562
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,600
Wow. Sorry.

563
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,100
# I feel pretty, #

564
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,200
# Oh, so pretty, #

565
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:19,900
# I feel pretty and witty and gay! #

566
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,200
# And I pity #

567
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:31,400
# Any girl who isn't me today. #

568
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,300
# I feel charming, #

569
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,200
# Oh, so charming #

570
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,800
# It's alarming how charming I feel! #

571
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,500
<i>Move your ass, dipshit!</i>

572
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,400
# And so pretty #

573
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,600
# That I hardly can believe I'm real #

574
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,700
<i>Burn in hell!</i>

575
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,600
# See the pretty girl in that mirror there?
What mirror? Where? #

576
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,500
# Who can that attractive girl be?
Wich one? Where? #

577
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,700
# Such a pretty face,
Such a pretty dress, #

578
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,000
# Such a pretty smile,
Such a pretty me! #

579
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,700
# - I feel stunning #
- I feel stunning

580
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,500
# - And entrancing #
- And entrancing

581
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:28,100
# Feel like running and dancing for joy, #

582
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,600
# For I'm loved #

583
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,900
# By a pretty wonderful boy! #

584
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,400
You're late.

585
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,100
Yes. There was a little bit
of a tie up on the bridge.

586
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,200
I didn't ask for a traffic report.
You're always late.

587
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,800
Now is the first time I've been late.
But you're right. I'm sorry.

588
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,600
May I interject?

589
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,000
You were about to say something else
before you said, "I'm sorry."

590
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,200
We mustn't absorb and repress.

591
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,200
-Who's this?
-I'm his anger management therapist.

592
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,900
You're in anger management?

593
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,600
Temporarily, yeah.

594
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:16,000
Do you remember the flight
to St. Louis...

595
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,400
...that I was on when they had to
turn the plane around?

596
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,400
Yeah, yeah. Because of that unruly
passenger in coach.

597
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,300
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

598
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:27,200
He doesn't like people
touching his clubs.

599
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,700
Well, that unruly passenger was me.

600
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:36,400
I got arrested at Kennedy. That's why
I didn't make the next flight.

601
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,200
You said your apartment caught fire.

602
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,600
Dissembling is a common tool
of the anger junkie.

603
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,900
Might I have your first name,
Mr. Head? And tell me it isn't Dick.

604
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,800
-It's Frank.
-Fran.

605
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,000
Isn't that normally a girl's name?

606
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,200
What went on on that flight?

607
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,600
To be honest with you,
it was a mix-up. I...

608
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,200
Jibber jabber. Jibber jabbering.
Mumbo jumbo.

609
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,900
Denial. Key, key, key, key, key, key.

610
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,300
Fran, your assistant beat the bejesus
out of a flight attendant.

611
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,200
-I didn't.
-You broke her nose.

612
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,900
I broke the cocktail waitress's nose.

613
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,500
I mean, I accidentally did that.

614
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,700
Dave, you have a disease.

615
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,600
Would you apologize if you
were a diabetic? Of course not.

616
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:28,300
Why do you feel you have to apologize
because you're suffering from T.A.S.?

617
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,100
T.A.S.?

618
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,000
Toxic Anger Syndrome.

619
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,700
I don't have T.A.S.

620
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:38,000
He's angry. It's a sickness,
not a crime, Fran.

621
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,900
His name is Frank!

622
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,400
No. I'm sorry.

623
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,300
Clothes for cats
isn't really a new idea...

624
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:05,100
...but there was never really a line
made for overweight cats...

625
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,300
...who might feel a little
self-conscious...

626
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,500
...about how they look
in certain outfits.

627
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:14,000
That's why I got the baggy sweater
on him, to cover up his gut.

628
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:17,000
And the beret to take attention
off his plump head.

629
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:21,100
Oh, little Meatball.
You tie this up tight...

630
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,600
...and away goes the chin.

631
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,500
I'm so handsome.

632
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:32,500
-Hey, Dave. This is your office?
-Andrew.

633
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,300
-What are you doing here?
-I played golf with Frank.

634
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,900
He's friends with my dad. We're
members of the same country club.

635
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,100
Really? I've been wanting to
play golf with him a long time.

636
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,700
-Is it awesome there?
-It's nice.

637
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,300
So, anyway, Dave, how's
anger management going?

638
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,700
Who told you about that?

639
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,500
Linda's my best friend.
There's no secrets between us.

640
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,300
For the love of Mike!
This guy's your girl's best friend?

641
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,300
No. I mean, I like to consider
myself her best friend...

642
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:09,300
...but Andrew is her best friend friend,
if that makes any sense.

643
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,200
You ought to golf yourself.
You look a little stressed out.

644
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,300
I gotta go. Bye.

645
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,000
Well, well, well.

646
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,300
This guy's got quite a basket on him.

647
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,600
Really? I didn't notice that.

648
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,400
Do you really want the love of your life
hanging around with a guy...

649
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,100
...who looks as though he could
satisfy a blue whale?

650
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,600
Well, it's...
I'm doing okay myself, pal.

651
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,600
Maybe it's the way his pants fit him.

652
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,700
What's up?

653
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,500
-This is your young lady?
-That's my Linda.

654
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,800
My, oh, my.

655
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:54,300
I was toying with the notion
that you were gay...

656
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:57,600
...because of the kitty-cat
clothes, so forth.

657
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,500
What does she do?

658
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:03,400
She teaches poetry. Poetry teacher.

659
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,600
I love poetry.

660
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,400
Oh, my, my, my. It's...

661
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,600
Yes, it's a good picture of her.

662
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,600
Well, apparently Dr. Rydell has a
history of unorthodox techniques.

663
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,600
He's got a dozen lawsuits pending.

664
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,300
So it's not just me.
This guy is nuts, isn't he?

665
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,500
Or a genius.

666
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:32,200
But if you could prove that he's nuts:
audiotape, video, picture, whatever...

667
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,400
...I'll arrange a hearing.

668
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,800
I gotta go. I think he's coming.

669
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,500
Hi, Nancy.

670
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,600
What are you doing
in the ladies' room?

671
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:54,300
Sorry. I just heard you guys
got cleaner seats than us.

672
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,500
Not after I get through with them.

673
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:04,400
I don't care for the way you've
ironed my shirts, Dave. Try it again.

674
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,700
-I've been very patient with you.
-Beware the fury of the patient man.

675
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:11,300
-I'm serious!
-Too serious.

676
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,000
Get undressed.

677
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,200
What did you say?

678
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,700
Take off your clothes.

679
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,400
I've got a stress-reduction
technique to show you.

680
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,600
-It'll be good for you.
-Take off my clothes?

681
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,200
Do you want to see me naked, Buddy?

682
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,100
Are you a homophobe, Dave?

683
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:35,400
No, I'm a pulling-my-penis-out-
in-front-of-you-a-phobe.

684
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,400
Let's take a walk on the wild side.

685
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,800
-What's up, baby?
-Why are we here?

686
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,300
I'm not a homophobe.

687
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,300
My lawyer's gay.
His boyfriend is gay.

688
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,900
And are they all aware
that you despise them?

689
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,500
Looking for company, baby?

690
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,600
No. We're not. Thank you.

691
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,500
It's worth 50 bucks...

692
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:13,200
...if you get in the back seat with
my friend here and have a little chat.

693
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,500
My pleasure, Mr. Eyebrows.

694
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,000
Oh, boy, here we go.

695
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:24,600
-Hello.
-Hey. Good to see you.

696
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:28,700
-What's your name, baby?
-Melvin.

697
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,500
His name is David. Don't dissemble.

698
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:35,100
I'm not dissembling.
That's my Hebrew name.

699
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,600
I'm Galaxia. That's my German name.

700
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,100
Great.

701
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,500
Where are you from originally,
Hebrew Melvin?

702
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,800
Brooklyn.

703
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,300
What part of Germany
do you hail from?

704
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:53,100
I'm from a little Bavarian village
called Lickin Zee Dickin.

705
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,700
Care to visit?

706
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,900
Actually, I like to spend
most of my time...

707
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,600
...in Girls Without Wieners-ville.

708
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:04,000
I'm more comfortable there.

709
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,200
He's just not used to male intimacy.

710
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:12,700
Well, that's okay,
because I'm a lady.

711
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,400
Oops, no, I'm not.

712
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,200
Whoa! There it is.

713
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,300
I feel like dancing. Dancing.

714
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:22,400
Oh, my God.

715
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:25,400
What does this have to do
with anger management?

716
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:29,100
-Oh, are you an angry boy?
-No.

717
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,900
Do you need some discipline?

718
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,300
No, thank you very--

719
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,700
Oh! Hey! Hey, watch that shit!

720
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,000
Listen, ladies!
Gentleman! Lentleman!

721
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,300
I'm not having sex with a she-male!
Relax!

722
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,000
Galaxia, you may
get out of the car now.

723
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,800
Your services are no longer required.

724
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,700
You know what?

725
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:51,700
You guys are freaks.

726
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,400
Give me the tape recorder.

727
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:59,700
Come on.

728
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,900
Patient number 135, David Buznik...

729
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,700
...has learned the difference between
unhealthy anger and righteous anger.

730
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:13,400
Thus he has advanced
to the second level of my program.

731
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:16,100
Great. Can I go throw up now?

732
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,900
I'm a lady. Oops, no, I'm not.

733
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,800
-Whoa, there it is.
-I feel like dancing.

734
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,200
Wasn't that sick?
She looked like Olivia Newton-John...

735
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:34,200
...if she was really ugly
and had huge balls.

736
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,000
But Buddy didn't order you
to have sex.

737
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,000
I'm getting a call.
Please hang on.

738
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,800
-Hello?
-Is Buddy there?

739
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,900
No, he's in the shower right now.

740
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,500
This is Becky, his assistant.

741
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:48,800
Just tell him his mom called
from Boston.

742
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:52,000
She said she's having
some minor surgery.

743
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:57,400
It's not serious, but she'll be at Boston
County Hospital for the next two days.

744
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:13,900
Miracles of modern science.
I am stimulating my hair follicles...

745
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:17,000
...and brushing my teeth
at the same time.

746
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,800
It looks really good.

747
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
What's the matter?

748
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:27,000
Your mom. They took her
to the hospital, Buddy.

749
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,000
What's wrong with my mother?

750
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,100
She's having surgery.

751
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:33,300
I'm sorry.

752
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:37,200
-Is it serious?
-When is surgery not serious?

753
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,900
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're right.

754
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:43,000
Maybe I better get up to Boston...

755
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,200
...see what's going on up there.

756
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:49,800
Yeah. Yeah.
Why don't you just go up there.

757
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,100
Spend some quality time.
I'll stay here.

758
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,900
It'll be good for you guys.

759
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,500
Oh, God.

760
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:05,300
You're all I got, Mom.
Please don't leave me.

761
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,800
No more clam chowder.

762
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,400
Buddy...

763
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,000
...it was a joke.

764
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,300
I'm sorry.
You don't have to cry anymore.

765
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,000
-A joke?
-Yeah.

766
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,800
Oh, boy.

767
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,800
A joke. A jo-- I...

768
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,800
I can't believe that
I fell for that one.

769
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,600
I really thought my mother
was having surgery.

770
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:42,400
I'm going to get you
back for that one.

771
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:49,300
Just so you know,
she really is having surgery.

772
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,300
I thought you said you were joking.

773
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,700
No, the serious part was the joke.

774
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:00,200
She's having surgery,
but just minor surgery.

775
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,600
Maybe I better get up to Boston...

776
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,900
...see what's really going on up there.

777
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:11,700
Why don't you--? You just
shoot up there. I'll be here.

778
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:16,900
What?

779
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:20,900
-I can't believe he's making me go.
-How come you guys aren't flying?

780
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:25,400
Because Dr. Cocoa Puff said legally
I'm not allowed to get on a plane.

781
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,100
Meanwhile, I've got Head up my ass
about that catalog.

782
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:31,000
I've got to get it done with
nut-boy in Boston.

783
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,300
Why can't Head write his own catalog?

784
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,900
Because I've got to earn
that promotion.

785
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:39,000
You've been doing his job for years.
You should be his--

786
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:42,000
I'm sorry. I know this is really
stressing you out.

787
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:45,300
I'm sure that it's going to be over
before you know it.

788
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:48,600
Yeah, if I don't get caught
popping any Jelly Stingers.

789
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,100
Well, that's going to be tough!

790
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,500
Oh, God. There he is.

791
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,700
-That's him?
-Yes.

792
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,300
What? Oh. Okay, I'll hold that.

793
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:12,700
My--

794
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,600
The quiet warmth

795
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:19,500
Smoldering beneath the rituals
Of hope for familiarity

796
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:22,400
A coursing underground river

797
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:26,100
Pregnant with the chance currents
Of knowledge and love

798
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:29,500
-What?
-That's my poem! I wrote that.

799
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,900
I know.

800
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,400
That is your poem.
I love that poem.

801
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,200
I found it crumpled up
behind the sports pages...

802
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,800
...on the floor of David's bedroom.

803
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:44,200
-Shades of early Emily Dickinson.
-Who was great on Police Woman.

804
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,900
Thank you. And thank you
for rescuing it from the floor.

805
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,600
I think I better get going.

806
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:56,900
I'll miss you, big guy,
so take good care.

807
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,900
-How about a kiss?
-I'd love a kiss.

808
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,900
I think she's talking to me.
I think I can handle it.

809
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,400
So why don't you back up
an inch or two.

810
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:05,700
Got it.

811
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,600
Thank you. And, take care.

812
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,100
Have a great trip, you guys.

813
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:12,500
Oh, we will.

814
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,800
Bye.

815
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:21,100
What?

816
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:24,600
Some mindless nitwit
is parked behind me.

817
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,300
Good. Then we can't go.

818
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,100
No, I can get out.

819
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:31,200
-Get in.
-I don't know how you'll get out.

820
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:35,900
Try to wiggle out, you're going to get
a ding. But you know everything.

821
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,300
What's he doing?

822
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:53,500
Well, you're batting a thousand...

823
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,400
...in craziness.

824
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,200
Now we're bumping into cars.

825
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:03,100
I'm just making a little room
to back up.

826
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,300
If I had lost my temper...

827
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:07,600
...would I have had
the presence of mind...

828
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,800
...to leave my card
and my insurance information?

829
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:14,500
Whatever, Mr. Insane-Vein-Popping-
A-Little-Too-Far-Out-Of-His-Head-...

830
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:17,000
...While-Swinging-The-Bat Guy.

831
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,800
I think you've got room to back up.

832
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:42,300
Why haven't you taken Linda
off the market?

833
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:43,700
Think you can do better?

834
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:47,100
I'm going to ask her to marry me
when I'm ready.

835
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,300
Nobody wants to settle down
with a 35-year-old secretary.

836
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,000
Procrastination, Dave.

837
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,600
I'm not procrastinating.

838
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,200
I even think about how I'm
going to pop the question.

839
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,000
Husky down jacket.
Husky Eskimo look.

840
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:04,000
What's your plan,
ask her at a Yankee game?

841
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,100
Actually, yes. How did you know?

842
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,600
I said the corniest thing
I could think of.

843
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,800
If you knew Linda, you'd know
how uncorny it would be to her.

844
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:15,600
Putting up a "Marry me, please"
on the scoreboard...

845
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:19,100
...proclaiming my love for her
in front of thousands of strangers.

846
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:24,300
As you seem to have noticed, I'm a little
bit jumpy with public affection.

847
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:27,500
You seemed to be lovey-dovey
back there.

848
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,400
Glad you think that's funny.
I gotta work.

849
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,100
A five-hour trip to find out Mommy
had a jelly bean...

850
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:52,400
...removed from her nose.

851
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:55,200
I'm glad I missed work.
Can we eat now?

852
00:53:56,305 --> 00:54:02,446
