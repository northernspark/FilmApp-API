- <i>Yeah.</i>

144

I'll take a look.
- <i>Good.</i>

<i>Pop, when are you gonna get rid of</i>
<i>those sinks, buy some new ones?</i>

146
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:35,531
- What are you talking about?
Those sinks are perfectly good.
- They're prehistoric!

147
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:38,475
- God forbid you should make a change.
- Here you are!

148

<i>I got plenty.</i>

No, thanks, I've been
a little nauseous all day.

151

You never take care of yourself.
You're always waitin' for
somebody else to do it for you.

152
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:53,258
- What's that mean?
- It means you were raised
like a little princess.

153
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,851
Hey, news flash! I was not raised
like a little princess.

154

<i>All right, all right.!</i>

Don't be nervous.
He's one of the top men in the field!

you don't have to bend or nothin'.

00:13:02,384 --> 00:13:06,047
I always think gynecologists
must have such back problems.

You know what that's from? It's
from all those elevators in the city.

You keep breathing air

somebody else's nostrils.

00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,141
- And it makes you sick.

227
00:14:23,165 --> 00:14:25,156
- Or we won't be able to
sleep in this room neither.
- I'm sorry.

00:14:25,234 --> 00:14:27,464
- Put me down quick.
- I'm sorry. Here.

It don't matter if it's

239
00:14:58,066 --> 00:15:00,899
'cause whatever we have this time, we'll
go and have the other one the next time.

Saltines.

245
00:15:22,524 --> 00:15:26,290
My sister when she was pregnant with the
twins and had the morning sickness...

246
00:15:26,361 --> 00:15:28,955
- she said the saltines helped her.
- Oh.

247
00:15:29,031 --> 00:15:32,762
So tomorrow I'm gonna go out
and get you a dozen boxes.

248
00:15:32,834 --> 00:15:36,565
- You want something now?
- No, no, Vinnie, please,
I'm just scared, okay?

249
00:15:36,638 --> 00:15:39,607
Promise me we're not gonna turn out
like Tina and Jerry, okay?

250
00:15:39,675 --> 00:15:42,109
Tell me we're special.

251
00:15:42,177 --> 00:15:45,943
We're special, baby.
You make us special.

252
00:15:46,014 --> 00:15:49,506
I know that.

253
00:15:49,584 --> 00:15:53,987
But enough's enough. Angela, I mean,
you can be special and normal too.

254
00:15:54,056 --> 00:15:58,152
A house, a crib,
a nice normal life.

255
00:15:59,895 --> 00:16:03,387
I mean, I can't wait.
Can you, huh?

256
00:16:06,268 --> 00:16:08,202
Oh, boy.

257
00:16:23,218 --> 00:16:26,654

Oh, I'm so pleased!
That's fantastic!

00:16:41,703 --> 00:16:45,696
Hey, come here! She's going to get
married. She's having a baby.

263
00:16:47,142 --> 00:16:52,170
- It's a breast pump!
- You are gonna thank me for this.

264
00:16:52,247 --> 00:16:54,613
Let's make a toast
to the baby.

265
00:16:54,683 --> 00:16:56,776
To the baby.

266
00:17:00,455 --> 00:17:03,356
You're gonna love it, Angie,
the whole thing.

267
00:17:03,425 --> 00:17:07,862
- It's the most beautiful
experience a woman can have.
- Damn straight!

268
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:11,490
Except for the water retention.
My hands swelled up so much...

269
00:17:11,566 --> 00:17:14,330
I had to go to a jeweler
to get my rings cut off.

270
00:17:14,403 --> 00:17:18,169
<i>Forget the hands. How 'bout the way</i>
<i>your breasts swell up?</i>

271
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,041
- I leaked so bad, I ruined 12 blouses.
- Oh, my God.

272
00:17:23,111 --> 00:17:25,045
That stuff,
it doesn't come out.

<i>Stop it.! You'll give her nightmares</i>
<i>for the next seven months.</i>

274
00:17:28,417 --> 00:17:32,751

- Of course it is.

275
00:17:33,822 --> 00:17:35,756
Oh, I'm...

276
00:17:35,824 --> 00:17:39,385
When I was born, my mother,
she pushed so hard she had
a B.M. right there on the table.

277
00:17:39,461 --> 00:17:43,192
Ah, I'm gonna uh...
I gotta take a walk.

278
00:17:43,265 --> 00:17:46,757
- Angie, don't listen to them.
- I'm sorry!

279
00:17:46,835 --> 00:17:50,202
[Vinnie] So,
when are you gonna start gettin' big?

280
00:17:50,272 --> 00:17:53,673
You're gonna look so sexy
when you get some meat on your bones.

281
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,837
Hey, look, baby names.

282
00:17:57,913 --> 00:18:02,373
Will I be sexy when my breasts
are leakin' and I'm having
bowel movements on the table?

283
00:18:02,451 --> 00:18:04,885
- What?
- Nothing.

284
00:18:04,953 --> 00:18:08,354
What aboutJoey orJohnny
if it's a boy? Johnny orJimmy?

285
00:18:08,423 --> 00:18:10,448
Or Debbie if it's a girl?

- This is a guy.

- The "guyest."

He's a real nut job, but he's cute.
He's from Ireland.

So cool.

You'll probably like her.

Get outta there. We're done.

- Come on, let's go. Come on.
- No.

545
00:37:42,298 --> 00:37:46,792
I have never been so humiliated in my
whole life. You didn't even see my face.

546
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:51,034
It's acting, Angela. Do you think the
guy in <i>The Elephant Man</i> said...

547
00:37:51,107 --> 00:37:54,008
"I ain't gonna do this 'cause you ain't
gonna see my face"? Huh?

548
00:37:54,077 --> 00:37:56,375
- Ow!
- Besides, your legs look terrific.

549
00:37:56,446 --> 00:38:00,780
- And you don't spell
"plumber" with two "Ms."
- It's somebody else's number.

550
00:38:02,185 --> 00:38:05,313
- You did a good job.
- Thank you. You, too.

551
00:38:05,388 --> 00:38:08,255
Thank you.

552
00:38:08,324 --> 00:38:11,259
So, I forgot to tell ya.

553
00:38:11,327 --> 00:38:14,660
- Took out a homeowners loan yesterday.
- Huh?

554
00:38:14,731 --> 00:38:18,167
- I bought a house.
- You forgot to tell me.
What, are you crazy?

555
00:38:18,234 --> 00:38:21,567
It's the sweetest little place you've
ever seen on Eighty-fourth Street, baby.

556
00:38:21,638 --> 00:38:25,233
- You're serious!
- Yeah! It's perfect. It's got a garage.

557
00:38:25,308 --> 00:38:27,776
It's got a little room for the baby.
You should've seen it.

558
00:38:27,844 --> 00:38:31,905
You're damn right I should've seen it
before you took out a loan on a house!

559
00:38:31,981 --> 00:38:34,711
A whole house!
Ain't I supposed to live in it too?

560
00:38:34,784 --> 00:38:37,947
Realtor said another couple were gonna
make an offer. I had to move on it!

561
00:38:38,021 --> 00:38:41,923
You've been goin' places
with a realtor behind my back?

562
00:38:41,991 --> 00:38:46,553
- Huh?
- Angela, you've seemed edgy lately.

563
00:38:46,629 --> 00:38:49,530
I thought I'd look at a few
places, check 'em out first.

564
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,033
Do all the legwork
and then show 'em to you.

565
00:38:52,101 --> 00:38:55,161
I never thought I'd have
to say "yes" to one on the spot.

566
00:38:58,975 --> 00:39:01,341
All right, Vinnie, look.

567
00:39:01,411 --> 00:39:04,312
I've been thinkin' about this so
I'm just gonna come out and say it.

568
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,712
I don't think it's a good idea
our gettin' married.

569
00:39:06,783 --> 00:39:11,584
- I don't think we'd be good
for each other.
- Angela, don't bust my balls.

570
00:39:11,654 --> 00:39:15,146
- You see it first.
Then if you don't like it...
- It's not just the house.
