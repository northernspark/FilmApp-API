2
00:01:33,643 --> 00:01:37,207
She was the first English woman
I had ever met.

3
00:01:37,327 --> 00:01:41,051
And it seemed to me she knew
more about the world than anyone.

4
00:01:41,131 --> 00:01:44,814
But it was a world Siam
was afraid would consume them.

5
00:01:45,936 --> 00:01:49,980
The monsoon winds had whispered
her arrival like a coming storm.

6
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:55,185
Some welcomed the rain,
but others feared a raging flood.

7
00:01:55,825 --> 00:02:00,790
Still she came, unaware
of the suspicion that preceded her.

8
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:05,996
But it wasn't until years later that I began
to appreciate how brave she was

9
00:02:06,076 --> 00:02:08,598
and how alone she must have felt.

10
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,601
An Englishwoman.

11
00:02:11,681 --> 00:02:14,164
The first I'd ever met.

12
00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:32,462
Mother! Come look!
I think they've killed someone!

13
00:02:32,582 --> 00:02:34,549
Louis, do take care by the railing.

14
00:02:34,584 --> 00:02:38,188
Beebe, Moonshee, gather your things.
It's time we went to shore.

15
00:02:38,228 --> 00:02:41,511
I think we should wait
until someone from the palace arrives.

16
00:02:41,631 --> 00:02:45,755
If they were coming, they would be here
already. Besides, the ship is leaving.

17
00:02:45,835 --> 00:02:47,797
My point exactly.

18
00:02:52,682 --> 00:02:54,644
Goodbye, Mrs. Leonowens.

19
00:02:58,728 --> 00:02:59,689
Louis!

20
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:04,975
Louis!

21
00:03:05,015 --> 00:03:06,016
Pardon me.

22
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,099
Louis, come along, darling.

23
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:10,780
- Mother?
- Yes?

24
00:03:10,861 --> 00:03:13,909
Why does this king need you
if nobody here speaks English?

25
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:17,908
The ways of England are the ways of
the world. It's a wise man who knows that.

26
00:03:22,392 --> 00:03:26,396
Memsahib, in less than an hour
the Newcastle sails,

27
00:03:26,476 --> 00:03:28,884
not to return for another month.

28
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:31,761
Tonight we shall all sleep
in our own home, I promise.

29
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:33,884
Madam. A carriage... where?

30
00:03:33,924 --> 00:03:35,926
A carriage? Wait, wait.

31
00:03:36,006 --> 00:03:39,249
What is it?

32
00:03:41,451 --> 00:03:43,413
Over there. This way, darling.

33
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:09,079
What do you suppose he's like,
this King Mongkut?

34
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,642
I heard that people used to be
forbidden to even look at his face

35
00:04:12,722 --> 00:04:14,924
and that they revere him as a god.

36
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,127
- You mean like Jesus?
- No, hardly!

37
00:04:17,287 --> 00:04:21,011
I suppose if he wishes his son
to be tutored in the ways of the West,

38
00:04:21,171 --> 00:04:23,293
then I should be quite honored.

39
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:26,016
But why can't he just send him to London?

40
00:04:26,056 --> 00:04:28,939
Then you wouldn't have
the chance to learn Siamese.

41
00:04:53,884 --> 00:04:57,047
Gracious me!
Are we sure this is the right road?

42
00:04:58,929 --> 00:05:00,850
How would we know?

43
00:05:01,011 --> 00:05:06,256
If you are not the lead elephant,
the scenery never changes!

44
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,005
Mother, look at those statues!

45
00:06:23,413 --> 00:06:25,455
Mem Leonowens, Kaw Rub.

46
00:06:25,575 --> 00:06:26,656
Mrs. Leonowens,

47
00:06:26,816 --> 00:06:31,501
His Excellency, Chao Phya Kralahome,
the prime minister of Siam.

48
00:06:36,706 --> 00:06:39,269
Have you any friends in Bangkok, sir?

49
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,192
No. I know no one here.

50
00:06:47,277 --> 00:06:48,638
Sir is married?

51
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,884
A widow. Can you please explain
to me why you call me sir?

52
00:06:54,764 --> 00:06:58,248
Women do not stand
in the presence of His Excellency.

53
00:07:03,573 --> 00:07:06,696
How long are you in possession
of dead husband?

54
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:10,540
23 months.

55
00:07:11,581 --> 00:07:12,983
How did he die?

56
00:07:14,424 --> 00:07:19,109
Please convey to His Excellency that my
purpose here is as tutor to the king's son

57
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:22,152
and it is not necessary
to ask personal questions.

58
00:07:22,712 --> 00:07:24,274
Please.

59
00:07:27,237 --> 00:07:30,600
In Siam, sir, it is custom

60
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,803
to first ask questions of personal nature

61
00:07:33,884 --> 00:07:35,845
to be polite.

62
00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:41,892
Mr. Prime Minister, I meant no disrespect.

63
00:07:42,852 --> 00:07:46,016
However, getting here
was something of a challenge.

64
00:07:46,056 --> 00:07:48,618
Sir will be shown to palace quarters.

65
00:07:48,653 --> 00:07:50,580
Mem.

66
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,944
I beg your pardon.
The king promised us a home

67
00:07:53,984 --> 00:07:55,986
outside the palace walls.

68
00:07:56,746 --> 00:07:58,788
It's what was agreed upon.

69
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:05,595
In Siam, Sir, you will learn
everything has its own time.

70
00:08:12,562 --> 00:08:15,805
Don't bother unpacking, Moonshee.
It's only for one night.

71
00:08:15,886 --> 00:08:20,170
It shall be settled to our satisfaction
or we'll be leaving as soon as possible.

72
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,892
We don't have any money.

73
00:08:21,932 --> 00:08:25,255
That is correct, but I do not need
to be reminded of that.

74
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,582
It sounds like we're living in a beehive.

75
00:08:32,622 --> 00:08:34,624
In the morning I shall go to the king.

76
00:08:34,704 --> 00:08:38,949
A monarch who fails to keep his word
is uncivilized, unenlightened and ungrateful.

77
00:08:38,989 --> 00:08:44,114
There are principles at stake. Having a proper
British household with some privacy is one.

78
00:08:44,154 --> 00:08:46,676
I don't think Siam
agrees with you, memsahib.

79
00:08:46,756 --> 00:08:48,959
Mother, how can it be a proper household?

80
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:52,002
You haven't lived in England
since you were little

81
00:08:52,042 --> 00:08:54,084
and I've never been there at all.

82
00:08:54,124 --> 00:08:57,167
India is British.
That's what being colonized is about.

83
00:08:59,169 --> 00:09:01,731
Father would have put him right in his place.

84
00:09:01,771 --> 00:09:04,334
I'm very sorry I'm not
the man your father was.

85
00:09:12,062 --> 00:09:14,104
I'm sorry, Louis.

86
00:09:14,824 --> 00:09:17,347
But this is a good opportunity for us.

87
00:09:18,588 --> 00:09:22,232
I should just... try to look at the positive side.

88
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:24,794
Assuming there is one.

89
00:09:24,915 --> 00:09:26,756
Your father would have.

90
00:09:26,877 --> 00:09:29,960
He was a brave man, wasn't he?

91
00:09:31,121 --> 00:09:33,083
Yes, very.

92
00:09:33,803 --> 00:09:35,765
And most considerate.

93
00:09:35,805 --> 00:09:38,488
Which is more than I can say for this king.

94
00:09:38,648 --> 00:09:40,730
Shall we go find your bed? Come on.

95
00:10:52,282 --> 00:10:55,325
Unfortunate
your meeting so delayed, sir.

96
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:58,528
King's obligation reach
into every corner of Siam.

97
00:10:58,688 --> 00:11:01,771
It has given me the time
to think of many things,

98
00:11:01,851 --> 00:11:04,654
including why you pretended
not to speak English.

99
00:11:04,774 --> 00:11:07,177
I believe it wise to be cautious.

100
00:11:07,217 --> 00:11:10,780
I will assume that our speaking now
is a great step forward.

101
00:11:10,815 --> 00:11:12,983
Best not to assume too much.

102
00:11:14,464 --> 00:11:16,586
When presented to His Majesty,

103
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:21,431
you and son will remember
to touch forehead to floor.

104
00:11:22,352 --> 00:11:25,876
Although we have become
better acquainted with your customs,

105
00:11:25,996 --> 00:11:28,678
we have certainly not forgotten our own.

106
00:11:28,718 --> 00:11:30,720
Then how will you greet him?

107
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,762
With the utmost respect.

108
00:11:46,256 --> 00:11:49,139
Mother, are those men speaking French?

109
00:11:49,219 --> 00:11:53,343
Yes. Apparently a warship's
run aground where it shouldn't have.

110
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:35,265
It appears sir must wait
to meet His Majesty another day.

111
00:12:36,626 --> 00:12:39,309
No, I do not think so. Come along.

112
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,192
Mem Leonowens!

113
00:12:43,313 --> 00:12:44,474
Mem! Wait!

114
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,556
Please!

115
00:12:46,957 --> 00:12:50,440
Your Majesty, I am Anna Leonowens.
I am the school...

116
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,522
Stop!

117
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:54,965
Who?! Who?!

118
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:58,848
Your Majesty,
Mem Anna Leonowens and son Louis.

119
00:13:01,491 --> 00:13:05,375
Your Majesty, we have been
kept waiting for nearly three weeks.

120
00:13:05,455 --> 00:13:08,738
I appreciate that you have
issues of great importance,

121
00:13:08,778 --> 00:13:10,941
but I imagine your son's education...

122
00:13:11,061 --> 00:13:12,502
Silence!

123
00:13:32,482 --> 00:13:35,045
You... are teacher?

124
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,127
Yes, Your Majesty, I am.

125
00:13:52,903 --> 00:13:57,507
You do not look sufficient of age
for scientific teaching.

126
00:13:57,627 --> 00:13:59,629
How many years have you?

127
00:14:01,952 --> 00:14:05,715
Enough to know that age and wisdom
do not necessarily go hand in hand.

128
00:14:05,876 --> 00:14:10,400
I doubt you would say same
for being bold and English.

129
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,123
They are rather inseparable, I'm afraid.

130
00:14:16,286 --> 00:14:19,209
His Majesty has not dismissed you.
Follow him.

131
00:14:21,491 --> 00:14:24,494
Come along, Louis. Up, up. Quickly!

132
00:14:39,229 --> 00:14:42,832
You articulate logical answer
under pressure, Mem Leonowens.

133
00:14:42,873 --> 00:14:45,035
That is very kind of you, Your Majesty.

134
00:14:45,155 --> 00:14:48,798
But irritating superior attitude
king find most unbeautiful.

135
00:14:48,838 --> 00:14:52,242
However, it will serve you well
given decision I now make.

136
00:14:52,322 --> 00:14:54,684
First impressions can often be misleading.

137
00:14:54,764 --> 00:14:57,287
Along with my eldest son,

138
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:01,171
you shall now teach all my children.

139
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,412
Come.

140
00:15:14,504 --> 00:15:16,546
The royal family.

141
00:15:16,586 --> 00:15:18,548
23 wives,

142
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,790
42 concubines,

143
00:15:20,871 --> 00:15:23,193
58 offspring,

144
00:15:23,313 --> 00:15:25,595
and 10 more on the way.

145
00:15:25,635 --> 00:15:29,639
Each one unique.
Each one my hope for the future.

146
00:15:34,764 --> 00:15:36,766
I understand your surprise.

147
00:15:36,846 --> 00:15:42,893
Not as many as Emperor of China, but
he did not spend half of life in monastery.

148
00:15:42,973 --> 00:15:44,935
King making up for lost time.

149
00:15:46,496 --> 00:15:48,458
Mother, what's a concubine?

150
00:16:08,558 --> 00:16:12,082
Presenting original pupil and heir apparent.

151
00:16:12,117 --> 00:16:14,164
Prince Chulalongkorn.

152
00:16:14,204 --> 00:16:17,127
This, my son, is your new teacher.

153
00:16:17,888 --> 00:16:20,090
It is a great honor, Your Highness.

154
00:16:35,866 --> 00:16:38,028
He doesn't look too happy about it.

155
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:03,613
This is a necessary
and practical gift I give to you

156
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:10,941
and you must never forget to honor your
renowned teacher Mem Anna Leonowens.

157
00:17:24,314 --> 00:17:26,316
Must not forget head wife.

158
00:17:26,356 --> 00:17:28,438
The Lady Thiang.

159
00:17:29,439 --> 00:17:32,682
It is my pleasure that you help
make her a fine scholar also.

160
00:17:32,842 --> 00:17:34,444
Lady Thiang.

161
00:17:34,564 --> 00:17:36,406
Welcome, mem teacher.

162
00:17:37,447 --> 00:17:39,089
Prince

163
00:17:39,209 --> 00:17:40,210
Thongkon Yai.

164
00:17:41,331 --> 00:17:43,293
Prince Suk Sawat.

165
00:17:46,937 --> 00:17:48,939
Princess Kannika Kaeo.

166
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,987
And Princess Fa-Ying.

167
00:17:57,027 --> 00:17:59,429
I'm not princess. I'm monkey.

168
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:01,671
My deepest apologies.

169
00:18:06,276 --> 00:18:08,718
I study her in English myself.

170
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,603
Well, Your Majesty,
I am most flattered by your welcome.

171
00:18:13,683 --> 00:18:17,367
And I find the opportunity
to be in a school an exciting one.

172
00:18:17,447 --> 00:18:20,370
Such devotion to progress
is to be commended.

173
00:18:24,294 --> 00:18:27,017
Reform is vital for my country's survival.

174
00:18:27,057 --> 00:18:30,860
As tiny feet change, so too will Siam.

175
00:18:30,941 --> 00:18:34,349
But being in a country
with so many unique customs,

176
00:18:34,384 --> 00:18:39,389
if I am to raise my son to be like his father,
which I very much hope he will be,

177
00:18:39,509 --> 00:18:42,832
then I must feel free
to follow our own traditions.

178
00:18:42,953 --> 00:18:45,715
As a father, I understand.

179
00:18:45,835 --> 00:18:50,440
Good. Then His Majesty will appreciate why
having a home outside the palace walls

180
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,682
is of such great importance to us.

181
00:18:52,762 --> 00:18:57,327
A home which had been promised
but so far has not been provided.

182
00:18:59,649 --> 00:19:02,692
It is my pleasure that you live in the palace.

183
00:19:05,655 --> 00:19:08,098
But it is not mine, Your Majesty.

184
00:19:12,502 --> 00:19:16,586
You do not set conditions
of your employment.

185
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:19,069
And you shall obey!

186
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:24,955
May I respectfully remind His Majesty
that I am not his servant but his guest!

187
00:19:27,597 --> 00:19:30,080
A guest who is paid.

188
00:19:32,202 --> 00:19:34,204
Education begins tomorrow.

189
00:19:36,126 --> 00:19:39,089
He sounds absolutely dreadful, if you ask me.

190
00:19:39,209 --> 00:19:41,131
He did unnerve me, I must say.

191
00:19:41,892 --> 00:19:45,535
Moonshee, why does
the king have so many wives?

192
00:19:45,655 --> 00:19:47,657
That is an excellent question

193
00:19:47,737 --> 00:19:49,579
for your mother.

194
00:19:52,022 --> 00:19:53,023
Mother?

195
00:19:53,063 --> 00:19:55,105
I heard you, Louis.

196
00:19:55,745 --> 00:19:58,748
Well, Siam is a monarchy
just like England.

197
00:19:58,788 --> 00:20:02,072
And one way that a royal family
maintains its control

198
00:20:02,152 --> 00:20:06,516
in the face of war and disease
is to have as many children as possible.

199
00:20:07,397 --> 00:20:10,440
So he needs a lot of wives
to take care of them?

200
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,963
A keen observation, darling.

201
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,245
Time for bed. Come and give us a kiss.

202
00:20:16,726 --> 00:20:18,648
Does he love all of them?

203
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:22,372
In a way.

204
00:20:22,452 --> 00:20:24,694
Like you loved Father?

205
00:20:25,655 --> 00:20:28,058
Things are very different here, Louis.

206
00:20:28,178 --> 00:20:30,100
Even love.

207
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,302
Go on. Off to bed.

208
00:20:35,385 --> 00:20:39,069
Mother, why doesn't Queen Victoria
have a lot of husbands?

209
00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:42,352
Good night, Louis.

210
00:21:35,805 --> 00:21:37,888
Presenting royal school, sir.

211
00:21:51,501 --> 00:21:53,503
Is anything wrong, sir?

212
00:21:53,623 --> 00:21:56,066
No. Nothing at all, Lady Thiang.

213
00:21:56,146 --> 00:21:58,108
Louis, that will be your desk.

214
00:22:07,357 --> 00:22:10,080
Yes. Well, I suppose class is now in session.

215
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,681
Sit down.

216
00:22:16,967 --> 00:22:19,009
Greetings, Mem Leonowens.

217
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:25,455
My father wish to give sir this
to put on path of good teaching.

218
00:22:25,495 --> 00:22:28,979
Well, I shall certainly
bear that in mind, Your Highness.

219
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:31,061
May I compliment you on your English?

220
00:22:37,267 --> 00:22:40,110
Siam - population six million,

221
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,994
spreading across 49 bountiful provinces,

222
00:22:44,034 --> 00:22:46,756
from Burma in west to Cambodia in east,

223
00:22:46,836 --> 00:22:49,479
presided over by King Maha Mongkut,

224
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:54,124
Lord of Life, whose strength
and power reach everywhere.

225
00:22:54,244 --> 00:22:56,566
Not in my house, they don't.

226
00:22:58,088 --> 00:23:00,891
Son of teacher is forgetting I am son of king.

227
00:23:00,971 --> 00:23:02,893
Son of teacher couldn't care less.

228
00:23:02,973 --> 00:23:05,295
You will sit somewhere else!

229
00:23:05,415 --> 00:23:06,616
I will not!

230
00:23:06,776 --> 00:23:09,059
Louis, remember what I told you.

231
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:11,421
I'm sorry, Mother. But he started it.

232
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:16,586
In my country, man never tell woman
he is sorry about anything... ever.

233
00:23:16,626 --> 00:23:18,708
If you had father, you would know that.

234
00:23:18,828 --> 00:23:21,111
You don't have a father! You have a map!

235
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,357
Louis!

236
00:23:22,392 --> 00:23:25,715
- It's forbidden to touch royalty!
- I didn't! I shoved you!

237
00:23:25,835 --> 00:23:28,318
Get one of your slaves to shove me back!

238
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:36,766
Get off me!

239
00:23:36,846 --> 00:23:38,248
Let me through. Excuse me.

240
00:23:38,328 --> 00:23:40,931
Stop it, Louis. That's enough!

241
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:51,001
Why?

242
00:24:54,084 --> 00:24:57,367
Prince insult memory of boy's father.

243
00:25:23,553 --> 00:25:27,837
998, 999,

244
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:30,640
1,000.

245
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,322
Finished.

246
00:25:32,362 --> 00:25:33,643
You may go home.

247
00:25:33,763 --> 00:25:35,405
Aren't you coming?

248
00:25:35,525 --> 00:25:38,889
Not until Prince Chulalongkorn
finishes his task.

249
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,723
I'm sorry, Lady Thiang,
but supper will have to wait.

250
00:26:13,843 --> 00:26:16,206
The prince has not yet been dismissed.

251
00:26:19,729 --> 00:26:22,612
His Majesty King Mongkut
afraid schoolteacher

252
00:26:22,732 --> 00:26:25,455
might get hungry during long night ahead.

253
00:26:25,535 --> 00:26:28,138
He send food... for one.

254
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,470
Why does my father humble me?

255
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,552
He wants what's best for you.

256
00:26:42,632 --> 00:26:44,955
For the moment, that includes me.

257
00:26:45,035 --> 00:26:47,037
Why?

258
00:26:48,838 --> 00:26:51,281
Most people do not see the world as it is.

259
00:26:51,321 --> 00:26:53,323
They see it as they are.

260
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,645
And a good king needs a broader view.

261
00:27:02,732 --> 00:27:04,774
Stay here, Your Highness.

262
00:27:46,216 --> 00:27:48,178
What is that smell?!

263
00:28:01,912 --> 00:28:06,156
She has been chained outside for six weeks.
All because she tried to buy her freedom.

264
00:28:06,276 --> 00:28:10,760
Mem Leonowens, Jao Jom Manda Ung
is daughter of very influential family.

265
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:15,365
Yes. And when La-Ore offered her the money,
she took it. Her mistress took it.

266
00:28:15,445 --> 00:28:17,447
Then she accused her of ingratitude

267
00:28:17,527 --> 00:28:20,490
and chained her like an animal
where the prince and I found her.

268
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:24,694
Heir to throne must never be involved
in issue of bondservant.

269
00:28:24,774 --> 00:28:26,776
It will resolve itself in time.

270
00:28:26,816 --> 00:28:27,978
Like my house?

271
00:28:28,058 --> 00:28:30,180
You are learning.

272
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:42,292
I have been doing much thinking,
mem teacher,

273
00:29:42,372 --> 00:29:46,736
on why some in this life are masters,
like Jao Jom Manda Ung,

274
00:29:46,776 --> 00:29:48,738
and others slaves.

275
00:29:48,858 --> 00:29:52,462
That is something you need
to ask your father, Your Highness.

276
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:54,504
But you are teacher.

277
00:29:54,624 --> 00:29:55,785
Teach.

278
00:30:08,879 --> 00:30:12,802
This American woman - Harriet Beecher
Stowe - asked the same question.

279
00:30:12,842 --> 00:30:16,526
Perhaps you should read her and then
we might continue our discussion.

280
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:22,812
A woman?

281
00:30:22,852 --> 00:30:24,494
Yes.

282
00:30:26,656 --> 00:30:28,578
Uncle Tom's Cabin.

283
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,022
I shall read it at once, mem.

284
00:32:16,126 --> 00:32:18,088
Come along, Louis!

285
00:32:19,329 --> 00:32:22,092
Quickly. We don't want to be late for school.

286
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,824
Were you not commanded
to leave slave issue alone?

287
00:32:34,985 --> 00:32:38,989
Your Excellency, I'm fully prepared
to obey His Majesty's commands

288
00:32:39,109 --> 00:32:41,711
within the obligation of my duties.

289
00:32:41,746 --> 00:32:44,314
Beyond that, I promise no obedience.

290
00:32:44,354 --> 00:32:46,716
You will follow.

291
00:33:11,621 --> 00:33:13,583
La-Ore purchased her freedom once,

292
00:33:13,663 --> 00:33:16,666
and I believe, had I given
this woman my ring first,

293
00:33:16,746 --> 00:33:20,510
she would have taken it
and continued to hold La-Ore captive.

294
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:25,035
King's commitment to noble families
must not be compromised.

295
00:33:26,156 --> 00:33:28,838
In your letter confirming my employment,

296
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:33,283
you said you wanted Siam to take its place
among the nations of the modern world.

297
00:33:33,323 --> 00:33:35,971
You spoke of building
something greater than yourself.

298
00:33:36,006 --> 00:33:40,330
A country where no man is above the law.
Which is why I chose to come here.

299
00:33:44,895 --> 00:33:48,298
Schoolteacher has outstanding memory.

300
00:34:03,113 --> 00:34:05,355
Kralahome...

301
00:34:05,435 --> 00:34:08,478
If you would please honor
Jao Jom Manda Ung

302
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,601
with an explanation of the law.

303
00:35:25,475 --> 00:35:27,517
Why did you intervene?

304
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:33,203
My conscience demanded it.

305
00:35:33,763 --> 00:35:35,805
And boys' fisticuffs?

306
00:35:35,845 --> 00:35:37,928
I beg your pardon?

307
00:35:37,968 --> 00:35:42,052
I suppose, since you must be
both mother and father to son,

308
00:35:42,092 --> 00:35:44,975
tendency to overprotect is strong.

309
00:35:46,656 --> 00:35:49,179
Louis can fend for himself, Your Majesty.

310
00:35:49,339 --> 00:35:51,301
It was your son I was protecting.

311
00:35:51,381 --> 00:35:55,505
Thank you for the supper.
Although I do not think it was necessary.

312
00:35:55,585 --> 00:35:57,032
I know my son.

313
00:35:57,067 --> 00:35:59,269
You would still be there.

314
00:35:59,304 --> 00:36:01,111
Perhaps.

315
00:36:01,151 --> 00:36:04,955
But then my point would have been made,
Your Majesty, not yours.

316
00:36:05,035 --> 00:36:07,037
- I am king.
- Yes.

317
00:36:07,077 --> 00:36:09,239
And I am his schoolteacher.

318
00:36:09,279 --> 00:36:11,561
Which lesson do you think he learnt?

319
00:36:11,681 --> 00:36:14,804
To respect his classmates
or to fear his father?

320
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:23,733
Husband must have been
very understanding.

321
00:36:27,497 --> 00:36:31,541
My husband was never threatened
by my ideas or my opinions.

322
00:36:33,383 --> 00:36:35,986
And because I am also such

323
00:36:36,146 --> 00:36:40,470
I will allow you to always
stand upright in my presence,

324
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:44,714
providing head shall
never be higher than mine.

325
00:36:46,796 --> 00:36:49,279
Thank you, Your Majesty.

326
00:36:56,887 --> 00:36:58,808
Your Majesty,

327
00:36:58,929 --> 00:37:02,812
I believe there has been enough insult
caused by this woman,

328
00:37:02,973 --> 00:37:05,855
who believes herself
to be the equal of a man.

329
00:37:07,377 --> 00:37:09,940
Not the equal of a man, Chao Phya.

330
00:37:11,661 --> 00:37:13,623
The equal of a king.

331
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:32,923
I make this for you tomorrow.

332
00:37:33,763 --> 00:37:36,726
Why, thank you, Fa-Ying. It's beautiful.

333
00:37:36,761 --> 00:37:39,049
These are monkeys at summer palace.

334
00:37:39,129 --> 00:37:41,131
And this must be you.

335
00:37:41,171 --> 00:37:43,693
I shall hang it on my wall at home.

336
00:37:43,773 --> 00:37:46,776
I will make another for you yesterday.

337
00:37:47,857 --> 00:37:50,020
Then I shall wait for it tomorrow.

338
00:37:54,264 --> 00:37:57,067
- Lady Thiang.
- Good morning, Mem Leonowens.

339
00:37:57,147 --> 00:38:01,191
This is Lady Tuptim.
She's new in palace, also like yourself.

340
00:38:04,194 --> 00:38:09,519
I wish also to learn writing of English to...

341
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,643
to please His Majesty King Mongkut.

342
00:38:13,763 --> 00:38:15,565
Yes, well, certainly.

343
00:38:15,685 --> 00:38:19,009
But I should hope that
it would please Lady Tuptim as well.

344
00:38:25,255 --> 00:38:27,217
And this is for you.

345
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:58,288
Make sure all of your books are open.

346
00:38:59,489 --> 00:39:02,532
Who knows the next letter
in the alphabet after E?

347
00:39:02,612 --> 00:39:04,574
- F.
- F.

348
00:39:07,857 --> 00:39:09,499
Who can tell me which words start with F?

349
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,022
Fa-Ying loves the river.

350
00:39:52,062 --> 00:39:55,545
Yes, she told me
all about her journey to Ayudhya.

351
00:39:55,585 --> 00:39:57,827
How it is the center of the universe.

352
00:39:57,867 --> 00:40:01,871
It is home to ancient ones
and their many legends.

353
00:40:01,952 --> 00:40:03,833
I told her in England we have Camelot.

354
00:40:03,994 --> 00:40:07,037
And a big round table.

355
00:40:07,117 --> 00:40:08,518
Yes, that's right.

356
00:40:08,678 --> 00:40:12,282
Everyone should have legends, I think.
It allows us to dream.

357
00:40:12,317 --> 00:40:15,805
You're an interesting mix
of fact and fancy, mem.

358
00:40:15,926 --> 00:40:19,529
I suppose it's because
I'm always surrounded by children.

359
00:40:19,609 --> 00:40:22,772
Teaching the young
is fulfilling endeavorment.

360
00:40:23,413 --> 00:40:25,415
I didn't have a choice really.

361
00:40:28,538 --> 00:40:31,141
Buddhists believe all life is suffering.

362
00:40:31,261 --> 00:40:35,545
Take away pain of husband's death...
takes away mem's chance to grow.

363
00:40:37,627 --> 00:40:40,830
- We might have preferred a different lesson.
- Yes.

364
00:40:40,911 --> 00:40:45,675
But unique opportunity to change world
would have passed to someone else.

365
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:56,806
Louis. Do try and stay in the boat, darling.

366
00:40:57,888 --> 00:41:03,133
He asked about your flag and the significance
of the white elephant. I had no answer.

367
00:41:03,213 --> 00:41:05,375
Louis Leonowens!

368
00:41:12,382 --> 00:41:13,743
Yes, Your Majesty?

369
00:41:13,823 --> 00:41:15,585
I am teacher now.

370
00:41:17,147 --> 00:41:18,788
The flag of Siam.

371
00:41:18,868 --> 00:41:20,790
- Red is for?
- Courage.

372
00:41:20,951 --> 00:41:22,993
- White?
- Compassion.

373
00:41:23,033 --> 00:41:27,837
The white elephant is Siam's
most rare and honored creature.

374
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:31,521
Perhaps on journey to rice festival
we will all see one.

375
00:41:31,561 --> 00:41:33,523
Rice festival?

376
00:41:33,643 --> 00:41:34,844
Mother!

377
00:41:34,965 --> 00:41:36,166
Mother, look!

378
00:41:36,246 --> 00:41:38,248
There's Moonshee and Beebe!

379
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:42,852
I trust you will find ample space

380
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:45,936
for engaging in English traditions.

381
00:41:45,976 --> 00:41:48,378
Even for growing of roses.

382
00:41:48,498 --> 00:41:51,942
Out of curiosity,
is this because of our agreement

383
00:41:51,982 --> 00:41:54,264
or are you simply trying to get rid of me?

384
00:41:56,466 --> 00:41:58,188
Yes.

385
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:12,402
A little soap and water,
and we will have a fine house, mem.

386
00:42:14,925 --> 00:42:16,766
Shall I make us some tea?

387
00:42:16,846 --> 00:42:19,409
Yes. That would be lovely.

388
00:42:57,527 --> 00:43:00,290
I remember my first rice festival.

389
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:02,933
People come from everywhere to see king.

390
00:43:03,053 --> 00:43:06,897
He bless all crops, and it begin to rain.

391
00:43:06,937 --> 00:43:09,059
I think he was a god.

392
00:43:11,061 --> 00:43:13,023
And now?

393
00:43:14,504 --> 00:43:16,826
He is also a man.

394
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:22,953
I feel very fortunate that we're invited.

395
00:43:23,914 --> 00:43:27,197
One cannot see Siam's beauty
living in Bangkok, mem.

396
00:43:28,758 --> 00:43:35,365
The mountains are so green and the skies
are more blue than even your eyes.

397
00:43:36,206 --> 00:43:37,767
I must find Louis.

398
00:43:37,847 --> 00:43:39,809
Louis!

399
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:53,463
- May I ask a favor, mem?
- Yes, certainly.

400
00:43:54,985 --> 00:43:57,267
To send this.

401
00:43:58,228 --> 00:44:01,831
I wish family to know
how happy I am here with king.

402
00:44:02,872 --> 00:44:06,276
I'll tell Moonshee
to find a messenger straight away.

403
00:44:06,716 --> 00:44:07,717
Mem...

404
00:44:08,678 --> 00:44:10,720
May I ask a question?

405
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,082
Yes.

406
00:44:13,203 --> 00:44:15,205
How did husband die?

407
00:44:16,846 --> 00:44:18,929
In my arms, actually.

408
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:25,735
How did mem survive?

409
00:44:27,978 --> 00:44:29,900
Just as you will.

410
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:31,982
One awful day at a time.

411
00:44:43,673 --> 00:44:46,476
Mem sha, Louis is teasing me.

412
00:44:46,596 --> 00:44:51,001
He say in England coldness
fall from sky like tiny feathers.

413
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:53,043
Why would I lie about snow?

414
00:44:53,203 --> 00:44:56,526
Please, mem, it is too hot.
Can make some now?

415
00:44:56,686 --> 00:45:01,211
Just because your father can make it rain
doesn't mean I can make it snow.

416
00:45:01,251 --> 00:45:04,494
At last I discover her limitations.

417
00:45:04,534 --> 00:45:06,501
I have many, Your Majesty.

418
00:45:06,536 --> 00:45:09,019
Father, will you make it snow, please?

419
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,942
Even for you, I cannot.

420
00:45:12,022 --> 00:45:14,905
But I've seen photographs
of such phenomenon.

421
00:45:14,985 --> 00:45:17,267
Blankets of it... up to here!

422
00:45:19,269 --> 00:45:21,871
Louis... Smoke?

423
00:45:22,512 --> 00:45:24,034
Me? Jolly good!

424
00:45:24,194 --> 00:45:26,156
No. No!

425
00:45:26,316 --> 00:45:28,438
But, Mother, he's the king.

426
00:45:28,518 --> 00:45:30,120
My father smoked too.

427
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,643
Yes, but your father had already
achieved his full height.

428
00:45:33,723 --> 00:45:36,766
I have been smoking since age six.

429
00:45:36,927 --> 00:45:40,210
And some believe me
to be a giant among men.

430
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:44,254
Yes. In intelligence
as well as stature, Your Majesty.

431
00:45:44,334 --> 00:45:48,058
Which is why, Louis,
I'm sure His Majesty was only teasing.

432
00:45:48,858 --> 00:45:53,783
I believe now is good time for all children
to spread amazing concept of snow

433
00:45:53,904 --> 00:45:55,906
to cool off court. Yes?

434
00:45:56,026 --> 00:45:57,988
Yes!

435
00:46:01,551 --> 00:46:03,954
I simply meant to open conversation

436
00:46:03,989 --> 00:46:06,316
in controversial fashion

437
00:46:06,436 --> 00:46:08,798
mem is so fond of.

438
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,403
I do have my opinions,
but they're merely that.

439
00:46:13,563 --> 00:46:18,929
I wish to compliment you for enlightening
children to open minds and taste life.

440
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:21,451
However,

441
00:46:21,491 --> 00:46:24,975
at this time
I shall not offer cigar to your son

442
00:46:25,095 --> 00:46:29,739
and you shall not teach this book to mine.

443
00:46:34,144 --> 00:46:40,110
Chulalongkorn has many questions, but one
cannot plow new fields in Siam overnight.

444
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:42,712
I understand, Your Majesty.

445
00:48:01,711 --> 00:48:05,115
Honestly, Louis.
I leave you alone for five minutes...

446
00:48:06,196 --> 00:48:08,238
It was his idea.

447
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:12,842
Just because Prince Chulalongkorn jumps off
a bridge doesn't mean you must as well.

448
00:48:12,882 --> 00:48:15,926
How can anyone smoke those things?

449
00:48:16,086 --> 00:48:18,488
Your father certainly enjoyed them.

450
00:48:22,892 --> 00:48:24,895
Is that why you like him?

451
00:48:24,975 --> 00:48:28,058
The king, I mean.
Because he reminds you of Father?

452
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:34,024
I think that cigar
has clouded your brain, young man.

453
00:48:34,905 --> 00:48:36,426
Go on. Go to sleep.

454
00:48:47,797 --> 00:48:51,281
You drag me out at night
and turn down five pounds a bushel?!

455
00:48:51,401 --> 00:48:55,165
- French offer seven!
- What is the matter with you people?!

456
00:48:55,245 --> 00:48:59,329
You seem to have a very high opinion
of the quality of your produce!

457
00:48:59,409 --> 00:49:03,413
That is the best price you're gonna get!
I'm not gonna offer any more!

458
00:51:11,381 --> 00:51:15,625
Now, we all know that this egg
will never fit into this bottle.

459
00:51:16,746 --> 00:51:18,748
It's a fact. It's the truth.

460
00:51:18,868 --> 00:51:21,871
And we rely on truth
to make judgments, don't we?

461
00:51:21,992 --> 00:51:27,197
What if our judgment is wrong, even when
we know for a fact that it must be right?

462
00:51:27,237 --> 00:51:30,760
Do we rely on our eyes
or do we believe in the impossible?

463
00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:45,335
You see, one way to achieve
the impossible is to change the climate.

464
00:52:01,751 --> 00:52:05,555
The French say I am uncivilized ruler.

465
00:52:06,316 --> 00:52:09,599
I, who have spent entire life

466
00:52:09,679 --> 00:52:13,603
attempting to teach self
history, literature, and science.

467
00:52:13,803 --> 00:52:16,406
Why would they print such things,
Your Majesty?

468
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:20,290
You are English.
You should not be so surprised.

469
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:23,133
Well, I can still be appalled.

470
00:52:23,253 --> 00:52:25,175
More importantly,

471
00:52:25,335 --> 00:52:29,980
do you, as a foreigner, see me in this light?

472
00:52:31,421 --> 00:52:34,304
I do not know all that you are, Your Majesty.

473
00:52:34,424 --> 00:52:36,826
But I believe I know what you're not.

474
00:52:36,947 --> 00:52:38,909
And you are not what they say.

475
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:43,873
Thank you, mem... for humble validation.

476
00:52:47,237 --> 00:52:50,440
I have decided to give self
anniversary dinner

477
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:53,964
and invite important
English nobles and diplomats.

478
00:52:54,084 --> 00:52:56,086
I don't understand.

479
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:59,689
French Indochina grows stronger
and more aggressive.

480
00:52:59,769 --> 00:53:05,135
But if I improve our foreign intercourse
with your queen's special envoy,

481
00:53:05,175 --> 00:53:09,259
French will think three times
before trying to undermine Siam.

482
00:53:10,901 --> 00:53:13,063
That's very clever, Your Majesty.

483
00:53:16,746 --> 00:53:19,829
As if to sound English bugles
in own defense.

484
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:22,913
You shall take charge of all formalities

485
00:53:22,993 --> 00:53:26,596
as mem is obvious choice
to make certain guests feel at home.

486
00:53:26,756 --> 00:53:29,279
But... the anniversary is when?

487
00:53:29,399 --> 00:53:31,361
Three weeks from yesterday.

488
00:53:31,401 --> 00:53:34,684
Three weeks?! That's impossible.

489
00:53:35,765 --> 00:53:37,928
Mem...

490
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,369
The egg

491
00:53:39,489 --> 00:53:41,932
is in the bottle.

492
00:54:22,812 --> 00:54:24,975
Only half a glass.

493
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:43,793
We cannot have the servant bowing
every time somebody walks into the banquet.

494
00:54:43,873 --> 00:54:45,875
I understand.

495
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:16,146
Just for one night.

496
00:55:16,186 --> 00:55:18,548
Thank you, Your Majesty.

497
00:55:32,242 --> 00:55:35,485
Sorry for nervousness.
This is first time in Siam history

498
00:55:35,605 --> 00:55:39,009
that king allow everyone
to stand up in his presence.

499
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:41,932
But only for tonight.

500
00:55:42,452 --> 00:55:46,016
Your country and mine
have much in common, Your Majesty.

501
00:55:46,056 --> 00:55:48,778
Rich cultures. Long histories.

502
00:55:48,858 --> 00:55:51,061
And now, it seems, Mrs. Leonowens.

503
00:55:51,141 --> 00:55:52,462
Yes.

504
00:55:52,502 --> 00:55:57,267
My children's horizons keep
expanding under her tutelage.

505
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:03,473
My husband and I have been
stationed all over the Orient.

506
00:56:03,633 --> 00:56:07,477
But I must say... I've never
seen anything quite like this.

507
00:56:07,637 --> 00:56:09,599
Extraordinary, isn't it?

508
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:14,004
Grand Palace born from
the mind of King Taksin.

509
00:56:14,164 --> 00:56:16,726
First man to unify all Siam.

510
00:56:16,766 --> 00:56:21,371
Our country owes its creation
to a man they declared insane.

511
00:56:21,451 --> 00:56:25,655
Well, these rooftops are a little nutty.

512
00:56:26,937 --> 00:56:29,299
He endeavored to build an empire,

513
00:56:29,419 --> 00:56:34,424
but the nobility that ran Siam
for generations had grown tired of his wars

514
00:56:34,504 --> 00:56:39,509
and replaced him with Mongkut's
grandfather, someone they could influence.

515
00:56:39,549 --> 00:56:44,114
Taksin they put in a velvet sack,
beaten to death with a sandalwood club,

516
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,396
and buried somewhere in palace.

517
00:56:46,476 --> 00:56:47,477
Oh, dear.

518
00:56:47,557 --> 00:56:50,640
It sounds as though you admire him, general.

519
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:55,565
I admire vision, Lady Bradley, in all its forms.

520
00:57:13,183 --> 00:57:17,988
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
I believe the sun set a little earlier today.

521
00:57:18,068 --> 00:57:19,709
Mem.

522
00:57:19,829 --> 00:57:23,473
You arrange all this
to influence positive future of Siam.

523
00:57:24,794 --> 00:57:28,118
And now you steal attention away from it.

524
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:33,483
Well, that was not my intention,
Your Majesty.

525
00:57:34,084 --> 00:57:36,006
Mrs. Leonowens.

526
00:57:36,126 --> 00:57:38,128
What a delightful surprise,

527
00:57:38,248 --> 00:57:42,612
encountering such an enchanting
countryman. And so far from home.

528
00:57:42,772 --> 00:57:45,495
Lord Bradley, this is indeed a great honor.

529
00:57:49,019 --> 00:57:52,742
I'm half-crazy

530
00:57:52,822 --> 00:57:56,266
All for the love of you

531
00:57:56,346 --> 00:57:59,910
It won't be a stylish marriage

532
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:03,673
I can't afford a carriage

533
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:06,957
But you'll look sweet upon the seat

534
00:58:07,037 --> 00:58:11,281
Of a bicycle made for two

535
00:58:19,169 --> 00:58:22,252
Gracious ladies, kind sirs,

536
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:27,257
on behalf of 68 brothers and sisters,
we thank you immeasurably

537
00:58:27,377 --> 00:58:29,739
and bid you most gracious evening.

538
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:44,234
Your son bears a striking resemblance
to his father, Mrs. Leonowens.

539
00:58:44,274 --> 00:58:47,837
I had the good fortune
of serving with him a few years ago.

540
00:58:47,877 --> 00:58:49,839
He was a courageous soldier, ma'am.

541
00:58:51,681 --> 00:58:53,683
I thank you, Captain Blake.

542
00:58:53,723 --> 00:58:57,447
Father, may I please kiss good night?

543
00:59:04,534 --> 00:59:08,698
If I may beg indulgence
for not wishing to break family tradition.

544
00:59:18,188 --> 00:59:20,470
I will be there in your dreams

545
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:22,512
as you will be in mine.

546
00:59:23,914 --> 00:59:25,875
- Good night.
- Good night.

547
00:59:32,482 --> 00:59:36,006
You have
a remarkable family, King Mongkut.

548
00:59:36,046 --> 00:59:38,768
A remarkably large one.

549
00:59:38,848 --> 00:59:40,850
Hardly seems fair.

550
00:59:40,931 --> 00:59:43,133
All these women for one man.

551
00:59:43,173 --> 00:59:46,016
Makes me wish I was Siamese myself.

552
00:59:48,858 --> 00:59:53,944
Mycroft Kincaid...
of East India Trading Company. Correct?

553
00:59:53,984 --> 00:59:56,466
Guilty as charged, Your Majesty.

554
00:59:56,546 --> 01:00:01,912
Mr. Kincaid's company is merely one of the
ways we try to foster economic relations

555
01:00:02,072 --> 01:00:04,554
with other countries, Your Majesty.

556
01:00:04,594 --> 01:00:09,399
Also, I think, to arrive at forefront
of world in wealth and power.

557
01:00:09,434 --> 01:00:10,400
Yes?

558
01:00:14,284 --> 01:00:18,648
Still, progress through commerce is logic.

559
01:00:18,808 --> 01:00:23,733
King find most practical
and excellent topic for discussion.

560
01:00:23,813 --> 01:00:28,178
With all due respect, Your Majesty,
it is a little far-fetched to think

561
01:00:28,258 --> 01:00:31,661
that commerce alone
will bring progress to your people.

562
01:00:31,781 --> 01:00:35,425
Especially when they're awash
with superstition and fear.

563
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:39,069
Like your lovely concubines here
with their talismans,

564
01:00:39,109 --> 01:00:42,432
worn, no doubt, to protect them
from us foreign devils.

565
01:00:52,562 --> 01:00:56,446
A friend once said, Mr. Kincaid,

566
01:00:56,526 --> 01:00:59,409
English also have fantastical beliefs.

567
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:05,375
Or am I mistaking your country
for being land of Merlin and Camelot?

568
01:01:07,137 --> 01:01:09,139
Point taken, Your Majesty.

569
01:01:09,259 --> 01:01:14,064
However, there is no arguing
the superiority of the English.

570
01:01:14,224 --> 01:01:18,308
And in the light of these dreadful massacres
up and down your border,

571
01:01:18,468 --> 01:01:21,871
it's no wonder you're seeking our favor.

572
01:01:22,032 --> 01:01:25,160
Superiority, Mr. Kincaid? I do not recall

573
01:01:25,195 --> 01:01:29,639
anyone being given the right to judge
whose culture or customs are superior.

574
01:01:29,674 --> 01:01:34,084
Especially when those judging have
frequently done so at the point of gun.

575
01:01:36,927 --> 01:01:39,209
Would you not agree, Your Majesty?

576
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,253
Quite.

577
01:01:44,975 --> 01:01:49,659
Well... the evenings here
are certainly warmer than in London.

578
01:01:49,779 --> 01:01:52,062
Hear, hear!

579
01:01:52,142 --> 01:01:55,145
A night made to order for anniversary party.

580
01:01:55,265 --> 01:02:00,510
Especially for a king who is
most charitable and forgiving.

581
01:02:03,233 --> 01:02:04,754
To our host!

582
01:02:04,874 --> 01:02:07,837
A true gentleman, generous in every way.

583
01:02:07,918 --> 01:02:12,607
May history mark this occasion
as the first step

584
01:02:12,642 --> 01:02:16,286
towards forging an alliance
between our two countries.

585
01:02:16,446 --> 01:02:19,689
His Majesty!

586
01:02:28,858 --> 01:02:32,542
And in honor
of our most distinguished guests

587
01:02:32,662 --> 01:02:37,307
a waltz, as is European custom
of dancing after dinner.

588
01:03:28,038 --> 01:03:32,442
I must tell you, Your Majesty,
that I have not done this in some time

589
01:03:32,562 --> 01:03:35,605
and, seeing as the evening
has gone so well,

590
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:38,728
we wouldn't want to end up
in a heap now, would we?

591
01:03:38,768 --> 01:03:41,211
I am king. I shall lead.

592
01:03:44,574 --> 01:03:47,657
I never danced with
an Englishwoman before, mem.

593
01:03:47,697 --> 01:03:49,619
Nor I with a king.

594
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:55,385
I want you to make promise, mem, to always
tell king what you think, no matter what.

595
01:03:55,505 --> 01:03:57,827
Like to man from East India Company.

596
01:03:59,829 --> 01:04:01,831
I always have.

597
01:04:56,846 --> 01:04:58,728
Mem.

598
01:04:58,808 --> 01:05:00,931
You're humming.

599
01:05:01,051 --> 01:05:03,453
Yes, I suppose I am.

600
01:05:03,573 --> 01:05:08,098
As alarming as this may sound, Beebe,
I'm feeling rather at home here now.

601
01:05:08,218 --> 01:05:13,223
What charming people, hm? You remember
when this marketplace used to terrify us?

602
01:05:13,303 --> 01:05:15,905
Like it was yesterday.

603
01:05:15,986 --> 01:05:18,828
I was afraid that dinner might unsettle you.

604
01:05:18,868 --> 01:05:21,511
All those Englishmen in uniform.

605
01:05:21,551 --> 01:05:25,235
Yes. I thought it would
make me miserably homesick.

606
01:05:25,395 --> 01:05:29,239
Quite the opposite.
I rather enjoyed myself. Even the dancing.

607
01:05:29,399 --> 01:05:31,361
Shall we get some of these?

608
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:53,863
And how did His Majesty fare
amongst all your countrymen?

609
01:05:53,984 --> 01:05:56,346
He was charming. Absolutely charming.

610
01:05:58,108 --> 01:06:03,233
I don't think I'll ever forget how he stood
there, holding his hand out as if I was...

611
01:06:03,353 --> 01:06:05,355
One of his 26 wives?

612
01:06:06,196 --> 01:06:09,759
Well, thank you, Beebe.
I hadn't thought of it in that way.

613
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:11,841
Well, perhaps you should.

614
01:07:26,156 --> 01:07:28,398
I have a surprise for you.

615
01:07:34,124 --> 01:07:35,245
How...

616
01:07:35,365 --> 01:07:37,327
How did you...

617
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,930
I'm not quite sure, actually.

618
01:07:42,172 --> 01:07:43,578
Thank you, mem.

619
01:07:43,613 --> 01:07:46,816
My family... is very important to me.

620
01:07:47,817 --> 01:07:50,420
I shall leave you to enjoy every word then.

621
01:08:07,677 --> 01:08:08,999
Your Majesty?

622
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,282
- You sent for me?
- Ah, yes.

623
01:08:12,362 --> 01:08:13,443
But here...

624
01:08:13,483 --> 01:08:15,445
Look.

625
01:08:17,727 --> 01:08:21,211
Something tells me
my little monkey did not go to bed

626
01:08:21,251 --> 01:08:23,613
- night of anniversary.
- Yes, I know.

627
01:08:23,693 --> 01:08:27,177
I've been presented with drawings
of couples dancing ever since.

628
01:08:31,741 --> 01:08:32,742
Come.

629
01:08:41,271 --> 01:08:43,353
Sit, please.

630
01:08:55,926 --> 01:08:59,609
Perhaps you should simply say
what it is you're trying so hard not to.

631
01:09:05,175 --> 01:09:07,297
I share this with you, mem,

632
01:09:07,377 --> 01:09:10,100
because I believe you to be trustworthy.

633
01:09:12,382 --> 01:09:16,947
Events are happening which
I now believe to be of Burmese origin,

634
01:09:17,107 --> 01:09:20,870
and I fear that military action is unavoidable.

635
01:09:21,511 --> 01:09:23,473
But Burma is British.

636
01:09:27,077 --> 01:09:28,278
Yes.

637
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:34,084
Then it is not the French that
you were worried about, was it?

638
01:09:42,292 --> 01:09:44,014
I see.

639
01:09:51,381 --> 01:09:57,787
On table, mem, is small gift of appreciation
for your many efforts at anniversary party.

640
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:18,568
Mem's hand

641
01:10:19,729 --> 01:10:21,731
has been lonely without such.

642
01:10:24,014 --> 01:10:26,816
It is... most kind, Your Majesty.

643
01:10:26,896 --> 01:10:28,858
It's very beautiful.

644
01:10:28,939 --> 01:10:30,981
Though I am terribly grateful...

645
01:10:31,101 --> 01:10:33,383
It is custom to bestow favors

646
01:10:33,423 --> 01:10:38,788
for those who... who please king.
And mem has done so.

647
01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:44,274
I'm sorry. I cannot accept such generosity.

648
01:11:04,294 --> 01:11:08,338
I hardly think ten days' rain
warrants the call to battle, Louis.

649
01:11:08,378 --> 01:11:10,620
May I suggest a retreat?

650
01:11:14,864 --> 01:11:18,668
Mother, I think I should have
a topknot like the other boys.

651
01:11:19,549 --> 01:11:21,952
I think you've gone a bit daft, darling.

652
01:11:22,072 --> 01:11:24,354
With all this rain, it's no wonder.

653
01:11:24,474 --> 01:11:26,756
I don't see why I have to miss school.

654
01:11:26,796 --> 01:11:30,800
Because your classroom's under water,
and I cannot have you ill.

655
01:11:45,535 --> 01:11:47,777
My most precious Tuptim.

656
01:11:47,857 --> 01:11:51,261
I know you will understand
why I must write this to you.

657
01:11:51,341 --> 01:11:56,106
When you were torn from my heart,
I was left with nothing but my faith.

658
01:11:56,146 --> 01:12:01,471
Which is why, I flam to live,
I must devote my life to Buddha.

659
01:12:01,511 --> 01:12:03,873
For only he can give me peace.

660
01:12:04,714 --> 01:12:07,077
I will never forget you.

661
01:13:03,493 --> 01:13:07,337
Fa-Ying was found
in the garden, riddled with fever.

662
01:13:07,417 --> 01:13:10,540
Difficult even for a grown man
to survive such.

663
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:14,664
Cholera always in world
but still hardly at all in Bangkok.

664
01:13:14,784 --> 01:13:18,668
- Is there nothing you can do?
- They have already begun. Listen.

665
01:13:18,788 --> 01:13:23,633
Phra Arahan. Reminding soul
to go to heaven and not lose way.

666
01:13:25,355 --> 01:13:28,638
It is why mem must not be heard weeping,

667
01:13:28,718 --> 01:13:33,283
as her soul will attach to sadness
and remain to comfort living.

668
01:13:36,886 --> 01:13:39,369
His Majesty is grateful.

669
01:13:40,370 --> 01:13:44,054
The little one has made
frequent mention of sir's name.

670
01:17:47,777 --> 01:17:49,779
Your Majesty?

671
01:17:49,819 --> 01:17:54,304
Being as the rain has stopped, the children
hoped you might join them for a picnic.

672
01:18:01,992 --> 01:18:03,954
Mem.

673
01:18:03,994 --> 01:18:07,397
I will always remember
your feelings for my daughter.

674
01:18:08,318 --> 01:18:12,082
And you shall never forget
you are not here to teach king.

675
01:18:12,202 --> 01:18:14,884
The children miss you terribly, Your Majesty.

676
01:18:18,648 --> 01:18:21,131
You cannot shut the world out for ever.

677
01:18:21,166 --> 01:18:23,533
Believe me, I've tried.

678
01:18:23,573 --> 01:18:27,177
When my Tom died, I thought
that my heart would never mend.

679
01:18:28,138 --> 01:18:30,220
But then there was Louis.

680
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:32,542
He was my salvation, you see.

681
01:18:32,662 --> 01:18:36,306
And yet you still refuse to live.

682
01:18:36,386 --> 01:18:38,748
I beg your pardon?

683
01:18:43,433 --> 01:18:45,235
A mother,

684
01:18:45,315 --> 01:18:47,037
a teacher,

685
01:18:47,157 --> 01:18:48,398
a widow.

686
01:18:48,438 --> 01:18:50,600
But you're never just... woman.

687
01:18:51,201 --> 01:18:53,243
That is not fair.

688
01:18:53,283 --> 01:18:58,888
In spite of all you say,
mem is not accepting passing of husband.

689
01:18:58,929 --> 01:19:00,931
It is why you so protect son,

690
01:19:01,011 --> 01:19:04,294
and why you devote all time
to books and issues,

691
01:19:04,414 --> 01:19:06,816
and why you cannot accept gift!

692
01:19:06,937 --> 01:19:08,939
Why are you doing this?

693
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:12,983
Because you lie even to yourself.

694
01:19:13,743 --> 01:19:16,146
So do not lecture me about living.

695
01:19:16,186 --> 01:19:19,189
You are not qualified.

696
01:21:04,614 --> 01:21:06,616
These hours are meant for sleep.

697
01:21:08,738 --> 01:21:10,700
You startled me.

698
01:21:11,541 --> 01:21:13,503
I thought it wise to do so.

699
01:21:17,867 --> 01:21:21,751
May I ask what His Majesty is doing awake
at such an ungodly hour?

700
01:21:21,911 --> 01:21:23,994
Gazing at the moon.

701
01:21:25,035 --> 01:21:27,557
Yes, she's beautiful.

702
01:21:27,677 --> 01:21:31,521
As the sun rises, she will surrender the night.

703
01:21:32,482 --> 01:21:36,006
But she is always with him,
even when he cannot see her.

704
01:21:38,128 --> 01:21:40,850
That must be a great comfort to him.

705
01:21:43,253 --> 01:21:45,015
Yes.

706
01:21:49,579 --> 01:21:53,783
This come from Bangkok.
You may find it of some interest.

707
01:21:55,225 --> 01:21:57,227
- It's from...
- Yes.

708
01:21:57,307 --> 01:21:58,949
Please to read.

709
01:21:59,869 --> 01:22:02,272
As monkey has stolen king's spectacles.

710
01:22:05,835 --> 01:22:10,961
"Your Majesty, the United States
sincerely appreciates your generous offer

711
01:22:11,081 --> 01:22:13,563
to help end this tragic conflict. "

712
01:22:13,643 --> 01:22:18,808
"Unfortunately our country does not reach
a latitude which favors the elephant. "

713
01:22:18,929 --> 01:22:23,213
"We are, however, highly grateful
for this indication of friendship. "

714
01:22:23,253 --> 01:22:26,096
"Your good friend, Abraham Lincoln. "

715
01:22:29,419 --> 01:22:33,023
I admire this man for what
he is trying to do for his people.

716
01:22:33,183 --> 01:22:39,629
They say at the Battle of Antietam,
70,000 men killed each other in one day.

717
01:22:39,669 --> 01:22:43,673
And each one of those soldiers
has a father who grieves.

718
01:22:43,793 --> 01:22:46,196
I'm father to all of Siam.

719
01:22:47,877 --> 01:22:50,400
Mem is not wrong about moving on.

720
01:22:51,801 --> 01:22:53,843
Neither were you, Your Majesty.

721
01:23:04,294 --> 01:23:08,378
When we return, it is time for teacher
to teach Chulalongkorn and others

722
01:23:08,458 --> 01:23:12,582
any subject she wish,
as long as king know first,

723
01:23:12,742 --> 01:23:15,265
so can be prepared for consequences.

724
01:23:16,386 --> 01:23:18,308
I will do my best, Your Majesty.

725
01:23:21,231 --> 01:23:25,595
And I was always believing
Englishwomen slept in hats!

726
01:23:47,257 --> 01:23:49,779
I have been wondering, mem.

727
01:23:49,819 --> 01:23:52,862
When it's my son's time to become king,

728
01:23:52,983 --> 01:23:55,265
will he be a good one?

729
01:23:55,345 --> 01:23:58,068
Well, he is still a boy, Your Majesty.

730
01:23:58,108 --> 01:24:02,712
But a keenly intelligent one,
with a warm heart and sympathetic soul.

731
01:24:02,872 --> 01:24:05,235
Qualities, I believe, of a great king.

732
01:24:08,798 --> 01:24:11,761
I want to thank you
for bringing me here - to Siam.

733
01:24:12,842 --> 01:24:15,605
I cannot imagine anywhere I would rather be.

734
01:24:18,648 --> 01:24:20,530
Were you happy in Bombay?

735
01:24:20,650 --> 01:24:22,652
I was never unhappy.

736
01:24:22,732 --> 01:24:26,256
But... I find myself traveling
from place to place,

737
01:24:26,376 --> 01:24:29,259
wondering where it is that I belong exactly.

738
01:24:31,341 --> 01:24:33,343
And I find myself here.

739
01:24:33,903 --> 01:24:36,426
Your path is as it should be.

740
01:24:38,228 --> 01:24:40,870
My mind has taken me
down many roads of late.

741
01:24:42,192 --> 01:24:44,674
All of which lead absolutely nowhere.

742
01:24:46,396 --> 01:24:48,398
What would Buddha say of that?

743
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,842
That roads are for journeys, mem.

744
01:24:55,245 --> 01:24:56,646
Not destinations.

745
01:25:02,612 --> 01:25:05,175
Don't your wives ever get jealous?

746
01:25:05,295 --> 01:25:08,258
I do not understand significance of question.

747
01:25:08,298 --> 01:25:11,942
- Forgive me. I was prying.
- No. Please, continue.

748
01:25:12,822 --> 01:25:15,585
Well, most of the world believes that

749
01:25:15,785 --> 01:25:18,828
a man and a woman
should share a relationship

750
01:25:18,868 --> 01:25:21,431
which is sacred only unto themselves.

751
01:25:25,395 --> 01:25:28,238
Each one of my wives
believes same about king.

752
01:25:29,599 --> 01:25:32,162
Not everyone can marry you, Your Majesty.

753
01:25:32,282 --> 01:25:34,244
Good thing.

754
01:25:34,324 --> 01:25:36,566
King need his rest sometime.

755
01:28:24,334 --> 01:28:26,256
You said my instincts were good.

756
01:28:28,658 --> 01:28:30,660
And what are they telling you?

757
01:28:31,942 --> 01:28:34,144
That you are not drinking either.

758
01:30:55,205 --> 01:30:58,688
All the bodies were stripped
and left to the sun.

759
01:30:59,329 --> 01:31:05,095
I fear Prince Chowfa and Alak
were cremated with the others.

760
01:31:06,536 --> 01:31:10,220
May their souls rest in peace.

761
01:31:12,302 --> 01:31:16,386
You couldn't have prevented
your brother's death, Your Majesty.

762
01:31:16,546 --> 01:31:18,548
Send my armies north.

763
01:31:18,628 --> 01:31:23,313
If Burma wants this war, they shall have it.

764
01:31:29,919 --> 01:31:31,121
Lord Bradley?

765
01:31:31,241 --> 01:31:35,125
Lady Bradley, Mr. Kincaid.
If I might have a moment of your time.

766
01:31:35,165 --> 01:31:37,287
I'm afraid a moment is all we have.

767
01:31:37,327 --> 01:31:40,210
We are leaving on the next boat,
and so should you.

768
01:31:40,971 --> 01:31:43,813
- My life is here, Lady Bradley.
- Nasty business.

769
01:31:43,853 --> 01:31:46,336
All this sabre-rattling.

770
01:31:46,496 --> 01:31:48,858
Not good for trade, I can tell you.

771
01:31:48,979 --> 01:31:52,582
The king's brother is most likely dead,
as is his general.

772
01:31:52,622 --> 01:31:55,345
I would hardly call his action unprovoked.

773
01:31:56,266 --> 01:31:58,468
What can I do for you, Mrs. Leonowens?

774
01:32:00,230 --> 01:32:02,792
Are the British behind these attacks on Siam?

775
01:32:02,872 --> 01:32:05,915
Huh! Stick to teaching, Mrs. Leonowens!

776
01:32:05,996 --> 01:32:08,878
It's obvious you know nothing about politics.

777
01:32:08,999 --> 01:32:12,642
Burma would not make a move
without England's blessing. That I know.

778
01:32:12,682 --> 01:32:14,684
Precisely.

779
01:32:14,724 --> 01:32:20,730
But if this crisis isn't resolved soon and a
country under our protection is threatened,

780
01:32:20,770 --> 01:32:23,613
we will have no choice
but to defend our interests.

781
01:32:24,934 --> 01:32:26,576
Our protection?

782
01:32:26,656 --> 01:32:28,703
Our interests?

783
01:32:28,738 --> 01:32:31,982
The ways of England
are the ways of the world, my dear.

784
01:32:32,102 --> 01:32:36,786
They are the ways of one world, Lady
Bradley. One I am ashamed to call my own.

785
01:32:36,826 --> 01:32:40,150
You forget yourself, madam.
Now if youll excuse us.

786
01:32:40,230 --> 01:32:41,992
No, I will not.

787
01:32:42,072 --> 01:32:44,074
You raised your glass to him!

788
01:32:44,154 --> 01:32:46,236
You commended him for his vision.

789
01:32:46,316 --> 01:32:49,679
And all the while you were waiting
to take his country from him.

790
01:32:49,839 --> 01:32:54,004
How the empire conducts its business
is really none of your concern.

791
01:32:54,524 --> 01:32:58,893
The last time I inquired, Lord Bradley,
I was still a British subject.

792
01:32:58,928 --> 01:33:03,373
A fact you would do well to remember
next time you're cheek to cheek with the king.

793
01:33:46,456 --> 01:33:48,498
What is it?

794
01:33:59,869 --> 01:34:01,791
Oh, my dear girl.

795
01:34:01,871 --> 01:34:03,353
What have you done?

796
01:34:05,275 --> 01:34:08,158
What I have done is not result of king

797
01:34:08,198 --> 01:34:10,200
or intention to dishonor.

798
01:34:11,201 --> 01:34:14,684
A concubine's heart
is of no consequence to king,

799
01:34:14,764 --> 01:34:17,927
consumed with matters
of the whole universe.

800
01:34:18,008 --> 01:34:21,131
But, Tuptim, why did you not come to me?

801
01:34:23,573 --> 01:34:25,935
The king might have understood.

802
01:34:25,976 --> 01:34:28,578
You simply can't do this to him - not now!

803
01:34:29,459 --> 01:34:35,425
If love was a choice, who would
ever choose such exquisite pain?

804
01:34:36,826 --> 01:34:39,429
This is what I need His Majesty to know.

805
01:34:39,469 --> 01:34:42,232
If such does not compromise you.

806
01:34:43,593 --> 01:34:46,076
I will tell him anything you wish.

807
01:34:49,559 --> 01:34:52,362
I thank Buddha for giving me direction.

808
01:34:53,323 --> 01:34:55,605
And now, with mem before me,

809
01:34:55,725 --> 01:34:59,449
I thank him for giving me true friend.

810
01:37:20,390 --> 01:37:26,196
He wrote to me to bid me farewell,
believing I was lost for ever to the inside.

811
01:37:26,356 --> 01:37:28,798
So committed his life to monastery!

812
01:38:51,321 --> 01:38:53,603
Stop it! Do you hear me?!

813
01:38:53,683 --> 01:38:56,046
Don't you dare lay
another hand on that woman!

814
01:38:57,127 --> 01:39:00,650
She has done nothing but to try
and find happiness! Do not touch me!

815
01:39:00,690 --> 01:39:03,733
I will go to the king!
He will put an end to this savagery!

816
01:39:13,023 --> 01:39:15,225
Thank you for seeing me, Your Majesty.

817
01:39:15,265 --> 01:39:18,548
I was told by your prime minister
this was none of my concern.

818
01:39:18,628 --> 01:39:20,630
It is none of mem's concern.

819
01:39:20,670 --> 01:39:23,994
And king is seeing you now
to tell you same himself.

820
01:39:24,114 --> 01:39:25,395
Forgive me, but...

821
01:39:25,435 --> 01:39:30,120
I do not wish for you to talk more
on this, mem. To king or anyone.

822
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:32,722
- I was only trying...
- Tuptim broke law!

823
01:39:32,802 --> 01:39:35,885
By loving someone?
"Sacrifice your life for truth. "

824
01:39:35,966 --> 01:39:39,049
"Persecute no man. "
Are these not the teachings of Buddha?

825
01:39:39,084 --> 01:39:41,651
I am king! And I say enough!

826
01:39:45,535 --> 01:39:48,658
You asked me to always tell you what I think.

827
01:39:48,738 --> 01:39:52,262
What you think... and what you do

828
01:39:52,302 --> 01:39:55,185
and how... and when you do them

829
01:39:55,305 --> 01:39:57,267
are not the same thing.

830
01:39:58,188 --> 01:40:01,071
If you believe I wish to execute this girl...

831
01:40:01,751 --> 01:40:05,155
But now, because you say to court

832
01:40:06,236 --> 01:40:08,918
you can tell king what to do,

833
01:40:09,039 --> 01:40:11,761
I cannot intervene as I had planned.

834
01:40:11,881 --> 01:40:13,923
Intervene? After they're tortured?

835
01:40:14,004 --> 01:40:15,405
Yes!

836
01:40:16,726 --> 01:40:20,810
But you, a woman and a foreigner,

837
01:40:22,132 --> 01:40:24,694
have made it seem king at your command.

838
01:40:24,854 --> 01:40:26,856
You have made me appear weak.

839
01:40:26,977 --> 01:40:30,620
And impossible for me
to step in and not lose face!

840
01:40:30,660 --> 01:40:32,943
- But you are the king.
- To remain such,

841
01:40:32,983 --> 01:40:36,391
I cannot undermine ability
to command loyalty,

842
01:40:36,426 --> 01:40:40,070
- which I must have to keep country secure.
- You have the power...

843
01:40:40,230 --> 01:40:43,713
Now is not the time to change
the way that things are done!

844
01:40:44,314 --> 01:40:46,276
Well, if not now, then when?

845
01:40:46,316 --> 01:40:49,960
How many more people must die
so that you might save face?!

846
01:40:59,409 --> 01:41:01,736
Go home, mem.

847
01:41:01,771 --> 01:41:03,813
You help enough for one day.

848
01:45:17,827 --> 01:45:22,152
For the life of me, I don't know
how you people can stand this heat.

849
01:45:22,272 --> 01:45:24,995
You have five minutes, Mr. Kincaid.

850
01:45:25,075 --> 01:45:27,117
I suggest you not waste them.

851
01:45:28,838 --> 01:45:31,601
I don't suppose I could have a glass of water?

852
01:45:35,525 --> 01:45:37,087
Right.

853
01:45:37,167 --> 01:45:39,409
Then I'll come straight to the point.

854
01:45:40,810 --> 01:45:46,576
As you know, I do a lot
of business with the Siamese,

855
01:45:46,656 --> 01:45:49,704
many of whom have ended up
dead in recent months.

856
01:45:49,739 --> 01:45:54,504
Which, as I have discovered,
is all part of some elaborate plot

857
01:45:54,624 --> 01:45:57,587
to make you think we British are the villains.

858
01:46:00,150 --> 01:46:03,033
I happen to know we are not.

859
01:46:03,593 --> 01:46:09,879
The acquisition of a particular little piece
of information has cost me a small fortune.

860
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:12,682
But the fact is, when all is said and done,

861
01:46:12,802 --> 01:46:16,046
I make more money
with Mongkut on the throne, so

862
01:46:16,086 --> 01:46:21,131
I think I'm about to become your best friend.

863
01:46:23,053 --> 01:46:29,459
Your Majesty, Alak will not stop
until all of your children are in velvet sacks.

864
01:46:30,780 --> 01:46:34,624
Kincaid said he'll blame
the coup on Burma,

865
01:46:34,704 --> 01:46:40,030
then launch a full-scale attack using
your troops already protecting the border.

866
01:46:41,151 --> 01:46:44,234
Alak seeks to finish
what Taksin only dreamed of.

867
01:46:44,274 --> 01:46:46,316
Taksin was insane.

868
01:46:46,396 --> 01:46:48,083
No.

869
01:46:48,118 --> 01:46:50,200
He was betrayed.

870
01:46:51,161 --> 01:46:53,123
As we are now.

871
01:46:54,084 --> 01:46:56,406
How long before Alak reaches the city?

872
01:46:56,566 --> 01:46:58,168
A week.

873
01:46:58,288 --> 01:46:59,889
Maybe less.

874
01:47:00,010 --> 01:47:01,972
And my armies?

875
01:47:02,132 --> 01:47:04,614
They will never reach the palace in time.

876
01:47:07,537 --> 01:47:09,499
Then he has already won.

877
01:47:11,341 --> 01:47:13,903
I will evacuate the royal family at once.

878
01:47:29,599 --> 01:47:31,001
No.

879
01:47:31,081 --> 01:47:33,043
Recall the army.

880
01:47:33,163 --> 01:47:35,125
And announce to the people

881
01:47:36,126 --> 01:47:39,289
we have just received glad tidings.

882
01:47:43,213 --> 01:47:45,175
Glad tidings, Your Majesty?

883
01:47:55,945 --> 01:47:59,389
Mother, doesn't "chahng see kao"
mean white elephant?

884
01:47:59,549 --> 01:48:02,912
- Do you think they've found one?
- Yes. In Prachin Buri.

885
01:48:03,033 --> 01:48:06,116
Entire village has seen it.
The first in 20 years!

886
01:48:06,236 --> 01:48:09,479
- I'll see to our tickets.
- I don't want to go, Mother.

887
01:48:09,599 --> 01:48:11,846
I don't want to leave my friends.

888
01:48:11,881 --> 01:48:15,685
- The king has done good things too.
- Your mother has much on her mind.

889
01:48:15,765 --> 01:48:18,128
You said the Siamese people are just like us.

890
01:48:18,168 --> 01:48:21,371
And what about Chulalongkorn?
Doesn't he matter any more?

891
01:48:24,134 --> 01:48:28,298
Believe me, darling.
I wish this could all be very different.

892
01:48:28,338 --> 01:48:30,380
It is the right decision.

893
01:48:30,420 --> 01:48:32,142
We must go.

894
01:48:48,918 --> 01:48:50,520
Sir.

895
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:56,806
You of all are most aware
there are certain boundaries I cannot cross.

896
01:48:56,886 --> 01:48:59,289
One being to contradict king.

897
01:48:59,329 --> 01:49:01,331
Yes. And God help him.

898
01:49:01,451 --> 01:49:02,657
Excuse me.

899
01:49:02,692 --> 01:49:05,575
Passage for four on the Newcastle.
Thank you.

900
01:49:05,655 --> 01:49:07,657
There is no white elephant, sir.

901
01:49:10,780 --> 01:49:13,583
King invented sighting at Prachin Buri

902
01:49:13,663 --> 01:49:18,308
so he can escort royal family
to greet imaginary beast, as in tradition.

903
01:49:18,388 --> 01:49:20,390
I don't understand.

904
01:49:24,474 --> 01:49:28,518
There is a traitor marching on palace.

905
01:49:29,559 --> 01:49:34,644
Deception's only purpose is to hide children
in monastery in village of Nong Khai.

906
01:49:35,966 --> 01:49:37,927
Please, mem.

907
01:49:38,088 --> 01:49:41,131
My king believes you are wise.

908
01:49:41,251 --> 01:49:45,015
You are only one who can persuade him
to stay with children

909
01:49:45,175 --> 01:49:48,858
until army returns to Bangkok
and palace is secure.

910
01:49:51,461 --> 01:49:53,463
Please, mem.

911
01:51:10,060 --> 01:51:14,424
I have just been informed of the nature
of your expedition, Your Majesty.

912
01:51:14,504 --> 01:51:19,269
And I would like to ask a few questions
about the dangers involved

913
01:51:19,349 --> 01:51:21,871
as I've heard, at times,

914
01:51:21,951 --> 01:51:24,714
wild elephants cannot be reasoned with.

915
01:51:26,997 --> 01:51:30,880
I am surprised Kralahome
took time to arouse such curiosity

916
01:51:30,920 --> 01:51:33,803
rather than make sure
mem not miss her boat.

917
01:51:36,126 --> 01:51:40,170
We have already missed our boat
so that I might speak with you now.

918
01:51:40,250 --> 01:51:42,452
King cannot miss his boat.

919
01:51:42,612 --> 01:51:46,296
If it will not be inconvenient,
we should like to go with you.

920
01:51:46,376 --> 01:51:49,339
Jungle is no place for proper English teacher.

921
01:51:49,419 --> 01:51:53,783
No, it is not, Your Majesty. Which is why
the presence of one in your cortege

922
01:51:53,903 --> 01:51:55,986
might help ensure your display.

923
01:52:00,550 --> 01:52:02,712
Something I feel,

924
01:52:02,792 --> 01:52:05,075
for many reasons,

925
01:52:05,155 --> 01:52:07,557
I would very much like to do.

926
01:53:07,897 --> 01:53:11,141
When a woman who has much to say
says nothing,

927
01:53:12,462 --> 01:53:14,624
her silence can be deafening.

928
01:53:20,590 --> 01:53:23,233
I wish to thank you, mem, for your courage.

929
01:53:27,998 --> 01:53:30,560
I thought I never wanted to see you again.

930
01:53:44,814 --> 01:53:48,618
I had a vision of young Tuptim and of Balat.

931
01:53:50,140 --> 01:53:53,348
I think by touching us all

932
01:53:53,383 --> 01:53:57,787
they have fulfilled their destiny
and attained eternal peace.

933
01:54:01,311 --> 01:54:05,875
Through birth and rebirth, we Buddhists
hope to learn from our mistakes.

934
01:54:10,760 --> 01:54:14,884
You told me once that I had never
accepted the loss of my husband.

935
01:54:14,924 --> 01:54:18,568
- I had no right.
- No, no. That was true.

936
01:54:19,209 --> 01:54:22,332
I now realize that
it is not enough to just survive.

937
01:54:23,653 --> 01:54:26,096
That life is... precious.

938
01:54:28,218 --> 01:54:31,941
Especially if youre Christian
and only allowed to have one.

939
01:54:36,426 --> 01:54:38,428
Why did you come back?

940
01:54:42,632 --> 01:54:45,515
Because I could not imagine
a Siam without you.

941
01:57:37,127 --> 01:57:39,169
What has happened?

942
01:57:39,249 --> 01:57:42,092
You and the children must
go on to Nong Khai without me.

943
01:57:42,212 --> 01:57:44,214
I will meet you there.

944
01:57:44,294 --> 01:57:47,577
I can see it in your eyes.
Something awful has happened.

945
01:57:47,697 --> 01:57:49,619
Was not to be this way, mem.

946
01:57:51,741 --> 01:57:53,783
Alak's army has found us.

947
01:57:53,863 --> 01:57:55,865
If he crosses the bridge,

948
01:57:57,027 --> 01:57:59,269
everything I love will die.

949
01:57:59,349 --> 01:58:01,831
- But they're only children.
- Yes.

950
01:58:02,552 --> 01:58:04,514
And each one heir to throne.

951
01:58:05,355 --> 01:58:07,397
Now... you must hurry.

952
01:58:08,798 --> 01:58:12,002
- What will you do?
- Blow up the bridge.

953
01:58:12,082 --> 01:58:14,084
But will that stop him?

954
01:58:14,164 --> 01:58:16,126
It will - if he's on it.

955
01:58:16,286 --> 01:58:20,330
Your Majesty, promise me...
Promise me that I will see you again.

956
01:58:28,418 --> 01:58:32,622
If your Bible is correct,
whole world created in seven days.

957
01:58:33,023 --> 01:58:35,185
Therefore

958
01:58:35,305 --> 01:58:37,947
possible handful of men can stop an army.

959
01:58:52,362 --> 01:58:56,646
But, Father, never has such
an expedition excluded royal children.

960
01:58:57,727 --> 01:59:02,572
My son, there are many things you will
come to understand when you are older.

961
01:59:02,692 --> 01:59:04,294
Why can't I stay with you?

962
01:59:04,454 --> 01:59:07,497
Because I need you
to lead our family to the monastery!

963
01:59:12,502 --> 01:59:15,625
There is no white elephant, is there?

964
01:59:48,498 --> 01:59:50,940
Come. Come.

965
02:03:22,632 --> 02:03:25,775
Mother, come look!
The king is waiting on the bridge.

966
02:03:25,810 --> 02:03:28,918
- What?
- There's hundreds of men on the other side.

967
02:03:40,730 --> 02:03:42,692
Wait! Stop the carriage.

968
02:07:29,679 --> 02:07:31,281
You!

969
02:07:32,202 --> 02:07:35,645
Why did you not go to monastery
like king order?

970
02:07:37,407 --> 02:07:40,490
Because I lost one man to the jungle,
Your Majesty.

971
02:07:40,570 --> 02:07:43,413
I was not about to let that happen again.

972
02:07:43,493 --> 02:07:46,056
Mem Anna not fully to blame, Father.

973
02:07:46,136 --> 02:07:49,619
After all, you did put me in charge.

974
02:07:57,427 --> 02:08:01,511
To sound English bugles in own defense.

975
02:08:02,472 --> 02:08:04,514
Yes.

976
02:08:07,357 --> 02:08:10,720
When king say handful of men
could save all Siam,

977
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:13,723
he was most unusually

978
02:08:14,724 --> 02:08:16,646
incorrect.

979
02:08:22,772 --> 02:08:26,336
And it be then that all ears hear

980
02:08:27,577 --> 02:08:30,020
what all eyes suddenly see.

981
02:08:30,100 --> 02:08:32,582
Great white beast in infinite splendor!

982
02:08:33,223 --> 02:08:35,265
Where's the beast?

983
02:08:37,427 --> 02:08:40,030
Great white beast!

984
02:08:45,915 --> 02:08:48,958
And as people rejoice
with overwhelming joy,

985
02:09:00,210 --> 02:09:06,376
most excellent conclusion to expedition
echoed in every corner of Siam.

986
02:09:06,456 --> 02:09:08,018
The end!

987
02:09:19,269 --> 02:09:21,311
Perfect! You were wonderful!

988
02:09:21,351 --> 02:09:23,273
Very, very good.

989
02:09:23,313 --> 02:09:27,917
Mem, this is play to commemorate
monumental occasion

990
02:09:27,998 --> 02:09:32,162
and we make fools of selves
because of insufficient practice.

991
02:09:32,282 --> 02:09:36,406
I understand truly, Your Highness.
But the celebration was tonight!

992
02:09:36,486 --> 02:09:38,448
We were duty-bound, were we not?

993
02:09:38,488 --> 02:09:40,971
- Were we not?
- Yes!

994
02:09:41,451 --> 02:09:46,176
I want you all to imagine next year,
when you've had time to perfect things.

995
02:09:46,211 --> 02:09:49,899
Then your father will be even more
proud of you than he already is.

996
02:09:51,461 --> 02:09:53,463
And you, mem?

997
02:09:53,498 --> 02:09:55,465
Will you be?

998
02:10:03,433 --> 02:10:06,436
I will always be proud of you, my children.

999
02:10:28,938 --> 02:10:32,462
I... ordered this some time ago
for the children, you know.

1000
02:10:32,542 --> 02:10:35,505
It's a fine example of scientific thinking,

1001
02:10:36,466 --> 02:10:38,868
as music is mathematical in nature.

1002
02:10:40,190 --> 02:10:43,913
Chords constructed from notes
in intervals of thirds,

1003
02:10:45,235 --> 02:10:48,238
and so on, and so on.

1004
02:10:49,199 --> 02:10:51,361
Precisely.

1005
02:10:59,009 --> 02:11:02,212
I would like to know... why,

1006
02:11:03,453 --> 02:11:07,337
if science can unravel
something as beautiful as music,

1007
02:11:08,298 --> 02:11:12,222
why it cannot posit a solution
for a schoolteacher and a king.

1008
02:11:13,663 --> 02:11:17,747
The manner in which
people might understand

1009
02:11:17,787 --> 02:11:20,870
such new possibilities is

1010
02:11:20,991 --> 02:11:23,913
also process of evolution.

1011
02:11:26,236 --> 02:11:28,438
Everything in Siam has its own time.

1012
02:11:33,963 --> 02:11:36,886
Even if king is also wanting it to be different.

1013
02:11:40,210 --> 02:11:42,172
I still must go, Your Majesty.

1014
02:11:50,380 --> 02:11:51,861
So,

1015
02:11:51,901 --> 02:11:53,903
where is it you will be going?

1016
02:11:56,266 --> 02:11:58,228
England.

1017
02:12:00,310 --> 02:12:02,312
Home.

1018
02:12:04,314 --> 02:12:06,316
This is good, mem.

1019
02:12:06,396 --> 02:12:08,798
Very good for Louis as well.

1020
02:12:20,210 --> 02:12:22,212
What?

1021
02:12:24,334 --> 02:12:26,376
Am wondering if,

1022
02:12:27,137 --> 02:12:29,099
given circumstances,

1023
02:12:30,620 --> 02:12:32,942
it is appropriate

1024
02:12:33,783 --> 02:12:35,785
for king to ask

1025
02:12:36,946 --> 02:12:38,908
Anna

1026
02:12:39,069 --> 02:12:41,031
to dance.

1027
02:12:45,435 --> 02:12:48,358
I have danced with a king before,
Your Majesty.

1028
02:12:54,004 --> 02:12:56,046
And I

1029
02:12:58,928 --> 02:13:00,850
an Englishwoman.

1030
02:13:27,557 --> 02:13:29,599
Until now,

1031
02:13:31,121 --> 02:13:33,123
Madam Leonowens,

1032
02:13:34,484 --> 02:13:36,966
I did not understand supposition

1033
02:13:37,967 --> 02:13:42,132
man could be satisfied
with only one woman.

1034
02:14:30,540 --> 02:14:33,188
I was only a boy,

1035
02:14:33,223 --> 02:14:37,827
but the image of my father holding
the woman he loved for the last time

1036
02:14:37,907 --> 02:14:40,790
has remained with me throughout the years.

1037
02:14:41,751 --> 02:14:46,756
It is always surprising how small a part of life
is taken up by meaningful moments.

1038
02:14:48,638 --> 02:14:51,761
Most often they are over before they start,

1039
02:14:51,881 --> 02:14:55,205
although they cast a light on the future

1040
02:14:55,245 --> 02:14:58,928
and make the person
who originated them unforgettable.

1041
02:15:00,570 --> 02:15:04,814
Anna had shined such a light on Siam.
