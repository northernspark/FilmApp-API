Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese

2
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,929
What should I do with this,
Your Excellency?

3
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,206
Yes.

4
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,806
I picked it out for Daria
Alexandrovna and the children.

5
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,766
<i>Bonjour,</i> Lili.

6
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,410
<i>Bonjour.</i>

7
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,046
<i>Bonjour,</i> Grisha.

8
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,281
<i>Bonjour.</i>

9
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,001
Vasya.

10
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,605
Who is coming to see
<i>Grand-maman</i>?

11
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,806
Me! Me! Me!

12
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,604
Come along,
my little ducklings.

13
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,245
Be good today. I'm off.

14
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,685
Read the chapter carefully.

15
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,040
I'll come back
to test you on it.

16
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,811
Read it twice.

17
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,926
<i>Au revoir.</i>

18
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,085
Oh, Stiva.

19
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,924
Aunt Dolly found a note
from the governess.

20
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,001
Well?

21
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,848
Stiva wants me to come to Moscow
to persuade Dolly to forgive him.

22
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,447
I'm to be deprived of my wife so
that adultery may be forgiven?

23
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,720
I can't excuse him just
because he's your brother.

24
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,569
Oh, it's for Dolly's sake, too.

25
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,801
Four committees today.

26
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,921
I have the world
waiting for me.

27
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,970
There's never time to
look at your exercises.

28
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,249
Serozha is doing very well,
Your Excellency.

29
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,049
Who put this shirt on you?

30
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,282
Well, never mind.
I'll come and hear you read.

31
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,847
Tomorrow, perhaps.

32
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,646
Thank you, Lukich.
Perhaps tomorrow.

33
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,684
No. No, no, not tomorrow.

34
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,000
Thank you, Your Excellency.

35
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,167
Come along.

36
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,605
Alexei, do you think nine years
of marriage and children

37
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,729
should count for nothing
against an infatuation?

38
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,201
No. Very well.

39
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,648
But sin has a price,
you may be sure of that.

40
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,321
But why?

41
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,120
Because that's
where Aunt Dolly lives.

42
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,130
But why?
I told you, Serozha.

43
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,043
She's not well.
I must go to see her.

44
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,565
But why, Mama?

45
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,563
Don't make Mama cry.

46
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,404
I'll be back before you know,
and bring you a present.

47
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,290
I don't want a present.
I want you to stay.

48
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,522
Oh, my little <i>Kotik.</i>

49
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,444
What present?

50
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,329
That's better.

51
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,762
It's the first time
I've left my little boy.

52
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,845
So, you're leaving your son
and I'm returning to mine.

53
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,729
I'm Countess Vronskaya.

54
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,009
I've been in St Petersburg for the
christening of a granddaughter.

55
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,764
My eldest son married
Princess Chirkov.

56
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,448
You're a charming creature.
Why don't I know you?

57
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,204
I've never been
in Moscow society, really.

58
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,611
But you know my name.

59
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,081
I've heard you mentioned.
Talked about, you mean?

60
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,605
Ah, love.

61
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,402
Was it love?
Always.

62
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,571
My sons are ashamed of me.

63
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,211
But I'd rather end up wishing I
hadn't than end up wishing I had.

64
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,486
Wouldn't you?

65
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,481
I don't know.

66
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,291
Some man came without an
appointment, Your Excellency.

67
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,441
Waiting outside.

68
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,525
Levin!
Where did you disappear?

69
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,564
I'm very anxious to see you.

70
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,081
I need your advice.

71
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,446
Well, come into my room, then.

72
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,763
This is my oldest friend,
Konstantin Dmitrievich Levin.

73
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,002
Someone send word
I'll be a few minutes late.

74
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,965
That's my office, up there.

75
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,046
Oh, I've been hard at it.
Sit down.

76
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,406
Hard at what, exactly?

77
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,323
Well, we're overwhelmed
with work.

78
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,401
Paperwork.

79
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,687
Paperwork is the soul of Russia.
Farming is only the stomach.

80
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,491
Now, when am I going to
come and shoot some snipe?

81
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,370
Look at you, in Western clothes you
told me you'd never wear again.

82
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,441
Something's up.

83
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,002
Yes, I'm in love.
I've come back to propose.

84
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,851
Have you guessed who she is?

85
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,561
I... I have a suspicion. Why didn't
you propose when you were here?

86
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,808
I decided it was impossible.

87
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,123
Kitty is of the heavens, an angel.
And I am of the earth.

88
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,841
But then, I thought and thought, and
there's no life for me without her.

89
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,684
Do I have a chance?
Of course you do.

90
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,966
The Shcherbatskys are giving
a soiree this evening.

91
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,644
Get there early,
before the crowd.

92
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,245
And if I may suggest...
Anything, what?

93
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,402
New boots.
Right. Anything else?

94
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,126
We'd better have
dinner together.

95
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,840
Come on. We'll meet
later at l'Angleterre.

96
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,211
Or do you prefer the Hermitage?

97
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,009
Let's say, 5:30
at l'Angleterre.

98
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,445
I owe them more
than the Hermitage,

99
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,931
so it wouldn't be fair
to withdraw my custom.

100
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,449
Uh, so, new boots,
coat, and a proper hat.

101
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,402
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

102
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,811
Do you...

103
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,366
Do you...

104
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,726
Excuse me.

105
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,091
It's so unfair.

106
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,365
You marry for love.

107
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,171
You're a good husband.

108
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,965
Children arrive, years depart.

109
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,049
And all of a sudden,
your wife grows old and tired.

110
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,600
And her hair is thin.
And her body...

111
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,762
And you yourself,
you still have your vigour!

112
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,924
And then you find yourself a martyr
to distraction by so many women.

113
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,843
Forgive me, but I find
that incomprehensible.

114
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,208
As though, I should leave this restaurant
and steal a roll from a baker's shop.

115
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,361
Well, you know,
a freshly baked roll.

116
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,206
I'm talking about love, and you're
talking about your appetite.

117
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,851
Easily confused. Now, do you
know, um, Count Vronsky?

118
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,445
Who? No. Why?

119
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,409
He's your rival. He turned up
from Petersburg after you left.

120
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,481
Who is he?

121
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,927
Oh, you don't need to worry about him.
He's... He's just...

122
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,650
He's a rich,
good-looking cavalry officer

123
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,246
who has nothing better to do
than make love to pretty women.

124
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,367
Is that cabbage soup?

125
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,569
<i>Potage aux choux é la russe,</i>
as the gentleman ordered.

126
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,449
It's what I wanted.

127
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,323
Understand that, for me, tonight
is a question of life and death.

128
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,731
Kostya...

129
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,641
Kostya, Kitty would be
mad to refuse you.

130
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,768
And Dolly's on
your side, you know?

131
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,001
She says her sister Kitty was always
meant to be your wife, and will be.

132
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,161
Dolly said that?

133
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,804
I've always thought
your Dolly was a gem.

134
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,006
She is.

135
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,200
She is.

136
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,169
I loved her to distraction.

137
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,885
Konstantin!

138
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,325
Konstantin!

139
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,131
Konstantin!

140
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,243
I'm too early.
I'll come back.

141
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,323
No. Come up.

142
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,690
Look at me.

143
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,525
I'm receiving for <i>Papa</i> and
<i>Maman,</i> who are late to dress.

144
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,329
It's my first reception.

145
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,129
Princess Ekaterina.

146
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,800
Delighted. Delighted.

147
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,283
I'm so pleased you were able to be
with us, Konstantin Dmitrievich.

148
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,650
Kitty, you look...

149
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,681
You look...
Stiva told us you were back.

150
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,761
How long are you staying?

151
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,161
I don't know.
It depends on you.

152
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,166
On me?

153
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,891
What I mean to say is I...

154
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,530
I only came with one purpose.

155
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,244
I want to...
Will you be my wife?

156
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,649
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

157
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,609
Wrong moment.
It's the wrong moment.

158
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,966
But will you?

159
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,561
I can't.

160
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,166
I'm sorry.

161
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,321
Yes.

162
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,805
It was impossible.

163
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,007
I'm sorry.

164
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,330
Are you the brother
of Nikolai Levin?

165
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,401
Yes.

166
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,927
He's in Moscow. He's staying
at the Unicorn in Khitrovka.

167
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,081
How do you know?

168
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,049
It's the sort of thing I know.

169
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,521
Count Vronsky?

170
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,961
Yes?

171
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,444
Princess Kitty.

172
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,127
It's been so long, and yet,
it seems like yesterday.

173
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,089
It was yesterday.

174
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,080
Excuse me.

175
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,481
No.

176
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,127
Sorry.

177
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,761
It's Kostya.

178
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,685
Good God! Look at him.

179
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,570
You look like a capitalist.

180
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,451
What do you want?

181
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,921
Nothing.
I came to see you.

182
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,322
Good evening, miss...
Madam.

183
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,801
Don't talk to her like that.
You sound like a magistrate.

184
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,689
More vodka for my brother!
Quick about it.

185
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,771
I don't want anything.

186
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,931
I'm all right.

187
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,965
Who told you where to find me?

188
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,806
A colonel in the Third Department.
They're watching you.

189
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,001
Good.

190
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,530
They must think I'm dangerous.

191
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,371
What have you got
to smile about?

192
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,441
Nothing.

193
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,567
That's right.

194
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,486
The day is coming. I have given
up my birthright for it.

195
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,362
You're on the wrong side
of history.

196
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,922
Not because privilege
is immoral.

197
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,287
But because it's irrational.

198
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,686
He's sick!

199
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,769
Let go, if you know
what's good for you.

200
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,649
I took Marya Nikolaevna
from a brothel.

201
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,924
But I consider her my wife.

202
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,721
If her presence offends,
you're free to leave.

203
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,046
Are you married?

204
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,205
No.

205
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,443
Why not? Are you waiting
to fall in love?

206
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,284
No.
Good.

207
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,086
Romantic love will be the last
illusion of the old order.

208
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,600
You should marry
one of your peasants.

209
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,087
Yes. I damn well should.

210
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,810
The brotherhood of man!

211
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,690
Nikolai, you need to
see a doctor.

212
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,167
Then come and stay with me at Pokrovskoe
till you get your health back.

213
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,571
With my wife?

214
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,121
If you...

215
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,207
Or...

216
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,082
Or go abroad to a spa.

217
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,320
I'll send more
if that's what you want.

218
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,365
Hello, what's this?

219
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,603
Austrian royalty on their honeymoon.
I've got them for four days.

220
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,082
The private carriage will
stop opposite the stand.

221
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,766
Bad luck.
What do they like, art?

222
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,841
Food.

223
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,771
Here's the train.

224
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,201
Oh.

225
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,646
I'll come back.

226
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,851
Stiva!

227
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,601
Anna!

228
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,201
You don't look ashamed!
Oh, I am, I really am.

229
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,689
Yes, of course. Oblonsky's
sister, Karenina.

230
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,331
<i>Charmante,</i> don't you think?

231
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,445
There, Countess.

232
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,409
You have found your son,
and I have found my brother.

233
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,209
Madam Karenina has a son, too.

234
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,760
It's the first time they've been
apart, so she frets about him.

235
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,242
Excuse me for not
recognising you before.

236
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,530
<i>Au revoir</i>, Countess.
<i>Au revoir</i>, my dear.

237
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,568
Let me kiss that pretty face.

238
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,611
Keep your people inside until
this has been cleared up.

239
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,847
The sole supporter
of a large family, they say.

240
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,649
Well, can't anything
be done for them?

241
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,370
Wait for me, <i>Maman.</i>

242
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,081
Stand back.
Move aside. Stand back.

243
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,889
I have you to thank for that.

244
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,565
Oh!
Oh, what a good fellow!

245
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,004
What a good fellow.

246
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,970
<i>Have you known
Count Vronsky long?</i>

247
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,841
Did you like him?
He's in love with Kitty.

248
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,686
Oh.

249
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,610
But we should be discussing
you and Dolly.

250
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,011
What have you got
to say for yourself?

251
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,924
I've said it all.
On my knees, in tears.

252
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,161
Now I need you to say it.

253
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,810
I'm going to the office, so
you'll have Dolly to yourself.

254
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,450
Don't be late home.

255
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,845
Oh, dear.

256
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,688
Kitty's coming by to see you.

257
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,809
She's all grown up
and a bit frightened of you.

258
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,848
The belle of
St Petersburg society.

259
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,161
Is that who I am?

260
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,806
Dolly.

261
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,610
Stiva has told me.

262
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,889
Oh, Dolly, I'm sorry.

263
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,128
From the bottom of my heart.

264
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,603
I don't know what to do.

265
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,848
I know. I know.

266
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,042
I can't bear to be with him.

267
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,681
And he doesn't care.
He's got what he wants.

268
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,082
What he wants is you.
He loves you, Dolly.

269
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,242
You and the children
are everything to him.

270
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,526
Are we?

271
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,250
And there is room
for a governess?

272
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,529
That was shameful, disgraceful,
but it was not love.

273
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,765
It was the animal in man,
not the soul.

274
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,649
Stiva's remorse is
from the soul.

275
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,124
Well, what about me?

276
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,327
Does his remorse
make it easier for me?

277
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,404
I know you are suffering.
But, Dolly, you must tell me.

278
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,961
Is there enough love left in your heart?
Enough to forgive him?

279
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,920
Well, when I think of them
together, I can't forgive him.

280
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,047
No.

281
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,607
My poor lamb. So you would
rather accept your fate?

282
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,806
My fate?

283
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,283
But I haven't done anything!
It's him who...

284
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,964
Do you love him, Dolly?

285
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,721
You love him, and he loves you.

286
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,131
But you can't forgive.

287
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,204
So, your lives must continue like this
forever, with both of you wretched.

288
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,610
Oh, that's pretty.
Is that a wedding dress?

289
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,806
Yes.

290
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,291
Look for
the "G" for "Grisha."

291
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,488
Here.
Oh.

292
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,925
Can you do your whole name?

293
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,002
Doesn't that look
like a princess? No?

294
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,329
I'm home!
Home, home, home!

295
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,448
Now, where are
my little ducklings?

296
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,489
Papa! Papa!

297
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,766
Papa!

298
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,602
Will you stay for
the Bobrishchevs' ball, Anna?

299
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,808
Oh. I always feel
dull at a ball.

300
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,411
Ah!

301
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,446
Stiva, tell Anna
she must come to the ball.

302
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,045
Well, of course she must.

303
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,640
And God go with you.

304
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,008
You can introduce me
to your new governess.

305
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,526
But she's old!
She's a hundred!

306
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,531
I know why you want me to come.

307
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,841
You want everyone to be there

308
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,446
because you're quite sure
it's going to be your night.

309
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,170
How did you know?

310
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,206
I know everything.

311
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,729
Oh, to be your age again.

312
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,131
Surrounded by that...

313
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,011
That blue mist.

314
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,883
I was 18, too,
when I got married.

315
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,010
Is the prince at home?

316
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,249
He's just gone up, I believe.

317
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,049
Is nobody receiving?

318
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,044
I can enquire, sir.
I don't think so.

319
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,642
The princess retired early.
Is there a message?

320
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,404
No. Thank you.

321
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,689
We thought you would
come back married.

322
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,921
Did you?

323
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,407
But you only came back
with a hat.

324
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,849
A black silk hat.

325
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,246
What kind of animal can you
make a hat like that from?

326
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,810
It's not natural.

327
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,930
Next time, perhaps.

328
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,643
There'll be no next time.

329
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,361
Kitty.

330
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,926
May I have a waltz?

331
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,684
You may, Boris.

332
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,604
I'll save you the third, just
because it's your first ball.

333
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,284
You're my first conquest!

334
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,562
Where do you want to be taken?

335
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,686
There.

336
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,681
How are you, Stiva?

337
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,445
Thanks to Anna, I am a happy man.
Would you like to dance?

338
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,124
No. Ask Anna.

339
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,925
No, I don't...

340
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,207
Come on, then. OBLONSKY: Oh!
Look out!

341
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,443
This vile, idiotic
matchmaking of yours.

342
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,807
For goodness' sake,
what have I done?

343
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,725
Is anything the matter?

344
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,961
No.

345
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,800
You look as lovely as ever,
Princess Kitty.

346
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,489
Don't ask me, <i>Maman.</i>

347
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,804
Kitty, it's us next.

348
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,044
Princess, I have the honour
to claim my dance.

349
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,369
He'll dance the mazurka
with Kitty. You'll see.

350
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,610
I am! I really am!

351
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,285
Dance with me.

352
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,929
I'm not used to being
spoken to like that

353
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,048
by a man I met once
at a railway station.

354
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,521
I dare say, but if I'm
not to dance with you,

355
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,410
then I'm getting out of
this operetta and going home.

356
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,170
Then, for Kitty's sake.

357
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,001
That's my sister.

358
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:48,524
Next stop is Bologoye!
Bologoye, next stop.

359
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,209
Can I be of service to you?

360
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,245
Why are you leaving Moscow?

361
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,570
What else can I do?

362
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,560
I have to be where you are.

363
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,130
Stop, that's enough.

364
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,326
Go back to Kitty.

365
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,207
No.

366
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,686
This is wrong.

367
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,091
It makes no difference.

368
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,367
You have no right.

369
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,930
It makes no difference.

370
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,770
You must forget me.

371
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,681
If you're a good man,
you'll forget everything.

372
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,122
And you? Will you forget?

373
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,680
Yes.

374
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,766
Is Serozha all right?

375
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,285
Oh, is that all I get?

376
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,407
Yes, he's quite well.

377
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,126
Were you a success?

378
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,247
I?

379
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,845
Oh, Dolly and Stiva.

380
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,006
Yes, I think so.

381
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,444
I'll announce myself.
Very good, sir.

382
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,251
Vronsky.
The master himself.

383
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,240
Baroness, coffee from the new
coffee pot for Count Vronsky.

384
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,005
I'll be off home
if I'm in the way.

385
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,368
You're at home
where you are, Baroness.

386
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,284
Oh! Oh, Pierre, you never say
such pretty things to me.

387
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,249
We were just
discussing my husband.

388
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,209
He won't divorce me, you see,
and do you know why?

389
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,045
No. Because he likes eating
off my family silver.

390
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,281
I want to bring an action.

391
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,885
Just because I'm supposed
to be unfaithful,

392
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,849
I don't see why I have to
eat off Pierre's crockery.

393
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,046
Look at it!

394
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,926
It's my crockery.

395
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,041
Oh!

396
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,565
How was Moscow?

397
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,600
Provincial.

398
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,966
Thank you for my presents.

399
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,005
I'm writing to Dolly
and to Kitty.

400
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,331
You are good.

401
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,005
Time for bed.

402
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,129
What are they saying in Moscow
about the new statute?

403
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,325
What new statute?

404
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,285
The new statute
I carried in Council.

405
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,091
No one mentioned it.

406
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,161
Really?

407
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,127
Oh.

408
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,927
Here, it caused
quite a sensation.

409
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,921
Princess Betsy.

410
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,361
Cousin.

411
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,329
I didn't know
you were an art lover.

412
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,890
I'm prepared to be one.

413
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,680
Countess Lydia tells me

414
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,240
you haven't been to one of her
evenings since you returned.

415
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,651
The last one was to
meet a missionary.

416
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,767
The one before that

417
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,810
was for a lecture on the union
of the Greek and Roman Churches.

418
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,609
Oh, I'm sorry.

419
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,330
I know you're fond of her.

420
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,090
Come on, or we'll be late.

421
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,330
Here's the thing, Vronsky.

422
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,085
A posting's come up, and there's
a promotion in it for you.

423
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,161
Thank you, sir.

424
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,685
In the garrison in Tashkent.

425
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,569
Tashkent? But...

426
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,322
I would like to stay in Peter,
sir, if you don't mind.

427
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,245
Well, I don't mind.

428
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,768
But your mother...
It's her idea.

429
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,928
Your husband is a saint,

430
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,891
and we must all cherish him
for Russia's sake.

431
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,242
You didn't come to my dinner.

432
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,765
I had to see my
Commanding Officer.

433
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,081
Well, "she" didn't come either.

434
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,443
I do hope you can
come on afterwards.

435
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:53,367
Father Kristof's report on the Chinese
mission will be with lantern slides.

436
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,164
I'm expected at the Tverskoys'.

437
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,286
No doubt.

438
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,841
But I'm sure that Princess
Betsy can wait for you.

439
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,486
Yes, in fact, I don't think
I will go to Betsy's.

440
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,880
You're caught.

441
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,365
I'm afraid I'm becoming
quite ridiculous.

442
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,085
Now, there's a phenomenon.

443
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,243
Look, Anna's shadow
has arrived before Anna.

444
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,125
I'm Anna's friend.

445
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,243
But all this making up
one's mind to it in public

446
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,846
is not polite to a distinguished
man like Karenin.

447
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,811
In my opinion, Karenin is a fool
and Anna is the best of us.

448
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,804
And we all love you for your
contrary opinions, Princess.

449
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,123
Alexei, you look desperate.

450
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,364
It's not attractive.

451
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,920
I'm losing hope.

452
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,286
Hope of what?

453
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,521
Persuading a virtuous woman
to break her marriage vows?

454
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,686
No, you're right.

455
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,771
She won't come.

456
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,291
He's gone.

457
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,528
But you're just in time
for the surprise.

458
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,530
Turn around!

459
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,608
May I have the honour
of bringing you an ice?

460
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,208
Ices are being served.

461
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,687
I would prefer
to try a cigarette.

462
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,531
<i>Courage.</i>

463
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,285
I'll try another one sometime.

464
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,281
When?

465
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,086
Where?

466
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,363
Just as I was thinking your manners
had improved since Moscow.

467
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,726
You behaved badly.

468
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,040
Very badly.

469
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,089
And who was
responsible for that?

470
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,444
Give me a cup of tea.

471
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,966
How nice!

472
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,849
Alexei Alexandrovich
has arrived.

473
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,640
I'm not sure my nerves can stand
another Alexei at this moment.

474
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,604
Were you glad to see me or not?

475
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,126
So the Schuzburgs
asked us to dinner.

476
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:15,364
The sauce was said to have cost a
thousand rubles, and it was ghastly.

477
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:24,561
I gave them a sauce that cost
85 kopeks and it was a triumph.

478
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,730
This must stop.

479
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,610
You make me feel as if I
were guilty of something.

480
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,841
What do you want me to do?

481
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,528
I want you to go to Moscow
and beg Kitty to forgive you.

482
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,170
No, that's not what you want.

483
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,969
Moscow?
I can do better than that.

484
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,211
Tonight I refused a posting
to Tashkent.

485
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,361
I can change my mind,
and you'll never see me again.

486
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,327
If you have any thought for me,
you will give me back my peace.

487
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,845
I have no peace to give.

488
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,650
There can be no peace for us.

489
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,564
Only misery
or the greatest happiness.

490
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,529
Your husband is impossible.

491
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,601
His opinions are all wrong,

492
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,728
but he talks so brilliantly,
he wins every argument.

493
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,131
What?

494
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,526
I called to take you home.

495
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,286
No, I'm staying.

496
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,843
Send the carriage back for me.

497
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:08,967
Of course.

498
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,487
Do you want me
to go to Tashkent?

499
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,445
So I'll go to Tashkent.

500
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,601
No!

501
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,525
I don't want you to go.

502
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,082
I stayed up to talk to you.

503
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,367
What about?

504
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,085
It's late.

505
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,610
Where's Annushka?

506
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,886
I sent her off.

507
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,766
Well.

508
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,363
If you want to talk,
but we should go to bed.

509
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,760
I must warn you
about something.

510
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:48,841
Warn me?

511
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,726
Oh, it's really rather late.

512
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,723
I wish to warn you that
you may, inadvertently

513
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,808
by indiscretion
and carelessness,

514
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,445
give the world occasion
to talk about you.

515
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,010
I am not a committee.

516
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,611
Please say
what you want to tell me.

517
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,922
You and Count Vronsky
attracted attention tonight.

518
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,241
You don't like it
when I don't talk to people,

519
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,520
and you don't like it
when I do.

520
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,925
I didn't notice
anything myself,

521
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,240
but I saw
everyone else noticed.

522
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,121
I consider jealousy to be insulting
to you and degrading to me.

523
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,089
I have no right
to inquire into your feelings.

524
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,409
They concern
only your conscience.

525
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,008
But it's my duty to remind you
that we are bound together by God,

526
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:33,402
and this bond can only be
broken by a crime against God.

527
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,842
I have nothing to say to you.

528
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,526
And you have a son.

529
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,211
And I'm tired.

530
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,886
If I am wrong,
I ask your pardon.

531
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,722
I don't know
what you're talking about,

532
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,609
and it's really
too late for this.

533
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,366
Excuse me, please.

534
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,680
Too late.

535
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,802
Oh, God! Oh, forgive me!

536
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,170
It's the end of everything.

537
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,567
I've got nothing left now
except you, remember that.

538
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,528
How could I not remember?

539
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,929
You're my happiness.

540
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,410
Happiness?

541
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,448
You murdered my happiness.

542
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,805
Murderer.

543
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,451
Murderer.

544
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,006
Go on.

545
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,366
Yes.

546
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,725
Go on. Murderer.

547
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,046
Murderer.

548
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,888
Look out, here they come.

549
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,645
Oh, bad luck.

550
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,244
<i>Potage aux choux á la russe!</i>

551
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,480
Agafia, if you
opened up in Moscow,

552
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,449
the l'Angleterre
would go out of business.

553
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,205
It's true.

554
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,687
Do you want news of Moscow?
Babylon? No.

555
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,321
Oh, you're right,
what do you care?

556
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,600
You love the country,
you've got it.

557
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,047
You love agriculturing, and,
Lord knows, you've got that.

558
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,326
You love shooting,
you've got that.

559
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,761
You've got everything you want.
Ha!

560
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,125
All right, go on, then.

561
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,680
Have you stopped
stealing bread rolls?

562
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,291
Ballet girl, Oriental type.
How can I help it?

563
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:02,641
How is...

564
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,165
How are the Shcherbatskys?

565
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,447
You mean Kitty.

566
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,010
Is she engaged now?
No.

567
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,607
Vronsky went back
to St Petersburg.

568
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,246
Huh.

569
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,046
Kitty will be seeing Dolly
at Ergoshovo in the summer.

570
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,641
You could...

571
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,324
Oh, yes, as if I had
time in the summer.

572
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,846
And I've got extra land at Kashin
this year for the haymaking.

573
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,763
Kashin? That's on the
Ergoshovo road, isn't it?

574
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,326
Couldn't you see Kitty
when she's there?

575
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,801
Especially, not then.
I humiliated myself once.

576
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,087
Oh, damn you, Kostya.
You love Kitty.

577
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,970
You love Kitty
and you can't forgive her

578
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,201
because, first, you funked it,
and then you bungled it.

579
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,924
And then you ran away
from an 18-year-old girl

580
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,446
who was made
a fool of by a uniform.

581
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,565
It's not you I feel
sorry for, it's Kitty.

582
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,926
Her heart told her no.

583
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,090
Did you come to shoot snipe
or criticise me?

584
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,850
Well, don't hold him
like a parcel.

585
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,801
Oh! It's Aunt Kitty,
darling.

586
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:02,609
Doesn't he make you ashamed
of dwelling on your troubles?

587
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,841
I have no troubles.

588
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,607
That man wasn't worth
the tears, believe me.

589
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:09,809
I don't care about him. I don't
even think about him, or her.

590
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,090
Except to hate her.

591
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,361
Then we'll never
speak of it again.

592
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,200
There are better men
waiting for you.

593
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,245
Stiva says...

594
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,560
Kitty, my lamb,
did Konstantin...

595
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,802
What has Levin
got to do with it?

596
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,769
Anyway, I'll never get married.

597
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:36,367
The whole business of it
has become disgusting to me.

598
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,721
And look what it's done for you.
Why do they call it love?

599
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,844
Because it's love.

600
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,080
I want you to,
I don't care about it.

601
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,241
You should care.

602
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,961
Anyway, someone
might be watching.

603
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,009
But I'm damned, anyway.

604
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,402
I'm not. I'm blessed.

605
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:13,690
You love me.
Yes.

606
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,125
Only me.
No.

607
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,728
Apart from Frou-Frou?
Yes.

608
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,923
But me more than your horse?

609
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,001
Yes.

610
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,365
Are you happy?

611
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,286
Yes.

612
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,411
And you love me?

613
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:33,641
Yes.

614
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,407
How much?

615
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,487
This much.

616
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,287
This much?

617
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:42,727
Yes.

618
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,764
This much?
Yes.

619
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,086
And this much?

620
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,846
Yes.

621
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:48,961
This much?

622
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,405
Yes.

623
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,608
This much?
And this much?

624
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,129
So, this is love.

625
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:13,771
This.

626
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,241
Countess.

627
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,528
I thought you would be
at Peterhof now.

628
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,840
I've come from there.

629
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,691
I'm distressed that you haven't
taken your usual house this year.

630
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,769
Anna wanted a change.

631
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:33,124
Nearer to Princess Betsy
at Tsarskoe Selo.

632
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,647
The guards are in summer camp
at Tsarskoe.

633
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,644
Alexei Alexandrovich,

634
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,690
forgive me, but...

635
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,288
You are too tolerant.
Your wife is...

636
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,522
Oh! Is this about my wife?

637
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,682
My wife is beyond reproach.

638
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,488
She is, after all, my wife.

639
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,769
Alyosha! Alyosha!

640
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:13,210
A message from <i>Maman.</i>

641
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,408
Her friend Princess Sorokina
has a house here

642
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,642
and a virgin daughter.

643
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,569
Well, that's not
part of the message,

644
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:20,971
but they'll all be at the races

645
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,641
and you're expected
to supper afterwards.

646
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,326
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

647
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,801
I give you the regiment!

648
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,364
The regiment!

649
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,723
I heard you turned down
a promotion.

650
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,723
That was <i>Maman</i> interfering.

651
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:39,847
Yes.

652
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,881
And now she's come up
with a princess for you.

653
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:47,324
Alexei, we're brothers,
so don't take of fence.

654
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,651
Getting married
puts the pack on your back.

655
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,371
It leaves your hands free
for climbing the ladder.

656
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,129
Getting serious
about a married woman

657
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,611
is like carrying
your pack in your arms.

658
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:00,284
So, they talk about me.

659
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,644
I'm leaving, Sasha.

660
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,325
An assignation?

661
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,129
Come on, I'll introduce you.

662
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,931
Beautiful.

663
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,048
A man would come to no harm.

664
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,569
Do you think
you'll win tomorrow?

665
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,600
Makhotin's
Gladiator is favourite.

666
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,605
Sixteen hands.

667
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,405
Frou-Frou looks dainty
beside him.

668
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,004
But she's got heart.

669
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,651
Haven't you, my darling?

670
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:48,606
Anna.

671
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,091
Alexei!

672
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,687
What is it?

673
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,245
I couldn't bear not to
see you before the race.

674
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:06,202
What were you thinking about?

675
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,531
Tell me.

676
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,085
I'm pregnant.

677
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,531
Oh, my love.

678
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,289
Well, love was
never a game to us.

679
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:26,200
Here's an end
to living in corners,

680
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:27,805
existing day to day on lies.

681
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,730
Yes.

682
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,963
Now we can be together.

683
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,529
How can we, Alexei?

684
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,603
Tell Karenin everything.

685
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,609
Do you think my husband
will make you a present of me?

686
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:39,727
Leave him.

687
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,131
Leave him and be your mistress?

688
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,850
Yes, run away.

689
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,127
I would never see my son again.

690
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,770
The laws are made by
husbands and fathers.

691
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,171
What, then?

692
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:56,120
I'll never forgive myself
for your unhappiness.

693
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,045
Unhappiness?

694
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,367
I'm like a starving beggar
who's been given food.

695
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:03,486
I, unhappy?

696
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,361
No.

697
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,163
This is my happiness.

698
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,130
Serozha!

699
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,610
Serozha, I'm coming to get you!

700
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,050
Where are you?

701
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,331
Serozha!

702
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,690
Where are you?

703
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,163
How are you, young man?

704
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:36,285
Your tutor doesn't seem
to be in evidence.

705
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,566
Yah!

706
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:42,851
Alexei.

707
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:45,288
You got away at last.
Can you stay?

708
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:46,926
Why?

709
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,802
Go and find Vasily Lukich.

710
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,521
I have to change.

711
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,364
Princess Betsy
is sending her trap for me.

712
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,091
Would you like to come? She's
taking me to watch the race.

713
00:57:58,360 --> 00:57:59,885
Races, surely.

714
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:03,408
No, I'll come on later.
Then I must get back to town.

715
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:38,766
Yes!

716
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,371
Princess! Princess!

717
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,124
A bet! Who do you
fancy in the next?

718
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:55,886
Kusolev.

719
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:57,930
I'm on Vronsky.
Pair of gloves?

720
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,125
Done.

721
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,203
Alexander Vronsky.

722
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,409
You are an exquisite creature.

723
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,562
You really ought to be
the spoils of victory today.

724
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,325
Yah! Yah!

725
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:15,764
Go, Frou-Frou! Go!

726
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,161
Go!

727
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,003
Go, Frou-Frou! Go!

728
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,564
Alexei!

729
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,251
I'm here.

730
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,210
Oh.

731
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,241
I'm here.

732
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,047
Get up!

733
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,126
Get up!

734
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:07,880
Her back is broken.

735
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,691
You know...

736
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:33,570
They say the Emperor
disapproves of the races.

737
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:35,526
The danger of injury.

738
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:36,647
But I...

739
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:37,846
What?

740
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:44,168
I'm saying I think there's a value
in manly sport, for the military.

741
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,006
I don't understand.

742
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:52,604
In my opinion, it's not the sport itself.
It's the spectacle.

743
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:55,203
It's making
a cruel spectacle out of...

744
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,084
What are you talking about?

745
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,490
I have to tell you...
Yes.

746
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:04,763
I have to tell you,
you behaved improperly today.

747
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,121
How is that?

748
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:13,087
By making plain your feeling
when one of the riders fell.

749
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:15,288
Your conduct was improper.

750
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:19,368
It must not occur again.
I have said it before.

751
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:25,209
You will say my concern
is unnecessary and ridiculous.

752
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,850
You are my wife.

753
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,883
I'm wrong to think that.

754
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:33,241
Yes?

755
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,491
Perhaps I was mistaken...

756
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,840
No.

757
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:39,849
You were not mistaken.

758
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,571
I love him.

759
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:48,444
I am his mistress.

760
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,083
Do what you like to me.

761
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,205
Wait. Please, move away.

762
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:18,567
I will not have a scandal. Therefore,
you will not see this man again.

763
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:22,721
You will behave in a way that
nothing is known against you

764
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,484
by society or by the servants.

765
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:29,402
In return, you will keep the
privileges of a wife, and the duties.

766
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:32,605
Tomorrow you will return home.
That is all.

767
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,290
Are you hurt?

768
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,410
What's happened?

769
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:13,402
I told him I'm your mistress.

770
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,964
He thinks I can give you
up and go on living.

771
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:17,724
No. You cannot.

772
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,091
Time for bed?

773
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:17,084
It was pleasant to hear you being
congratulated on your husband.

774
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:20,049
Not that I care
for decorations, but...

775
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,890
Alexei, I can't. I'm sorry.

776
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,001
Oh.

777
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,803
But I'm his wife, now.

778
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,964
I'm having his child.

779
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,926
Tell me what I did
to deserve this.

780
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:39,687
Halt!

781
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:04,283
How many mowers
is it, Theodore?

782
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:06,362
Forty-two, Master.

783
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:10,721
In your father's time, it was
work for two days for 30 men.

784
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,529
Though he never
picked up a scythe himself.

785
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,162
The men don't like me for it.

786
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:18,402
They like what they're used to.

787
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:20,011
It settles me.

788
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,241
How is that, Master?

789
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:24,731
When I'm mowing, I don't
ask myself why I'm here.

790
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:27,280
You're here to be
Master Konstantin Dmitrievich.

791
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:29,562
As it's always been,
by the grace of God.

792
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,161
My father owned you, Theodore.

793
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:35,087
Owned you like chattels
to be bought and sold.

794
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:36,810
Was that by the grace of God?

795
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:39,731
It was.

796
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:42,408
That's my youngest
you were looking at, there.

797
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:47,171
His young life is perilous now since the
freedom came and work must be found.

798
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:49,644
They look happier
than I've ever been.

799
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:55,291
Is it living simply
that I'm looking for?

800
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,330
I'm expected.

801
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:33,881
No.

802
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,002
I will not live like this.

803
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:40,482
This waiting
for hour after hour,

804
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:42,722
not knowing
when I'll ever see you again.

805
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:44,641
Sorry.

806
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:47,290
It's my demon.
I can't help it.

807
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:48,720
You wrote that you were ill.

808
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:49,926
Don't worry,
it won't be for long.

809
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,411
Stop.
No, it's true.

810
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:52,766
I was told it in a dream.

811
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:54,046
There.
It was only a bad dream.

812
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:55,690
Yes, and I'm only going
to die having your baby.

813
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:58,161
That's all nonsense.
Tell me it is.

814
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:00,524
Tell me it is.

815
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:03,811
You love me, only me.

816
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:06,611
Your note said
your husband would be out.

817
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:09,161
He was late.
It serves him right.

818
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,565
And you...

819
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,650
Why do you call him my husband?

820
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:17,085
He isn't my husband,
he's a clock.

821
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:19,970
But it was awkward. My honour.
You made an agreement.

822
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:22,920
Do you think of your honour when you're
sharing whores with your Colonel?

823
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,644
Your demon again?

824
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:28,008
I'll be glad to die
before you start to hate me.

825
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,320
Anna.

826
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:32,685
Put your hand there.

827
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:35,770
You can feel him move.

828
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,606
I respectfully ask
Minister Karenin

829
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:46,084
whether his proposals for the regulation
of these colourful gypsy tribes

830
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:49,803
of these scholarly,
God-fearing Jews, and of...

831
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:54,328
But I'm afraid I've lost
the Minister's attention.

832
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:57,727
Who is here?

833
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,529
Only Madame, Your Excellency.

834
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:07,050
I wanted to see him because...

835
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:10,602
I do not wish to know why a
woman wants to see her lover.

836
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:12,560
What are you doing?

837
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:14,131
I want his letters!

838
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,887
I am going to Moscow tomorrow,
and then the provinces

839
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:24,770
with a commission to investigate
conditions among the Jews and gypsies,

840
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:27,650
whose conditions
I infinitely prefer to my own.

841
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:31,850
I will not return to this house until
divorce has driven you into the street.

842
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,320
Meanwhile, my son will be sent
to live with my eldest sister.

843
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:36,681
No, Alexei, please.
Please, leave me Serozha!

844
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,048
Do you think
I would let you have my son?

845
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:41,122
You are depraved.
A woman without honour.

846
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:44,204
I thank God the curse of
love is lifted from me.

847
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:02,769
I need your advice.

848
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:11,723
Come on, come on!
Yes, yes.

849
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,122
Right, after you, after you.

850
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:19,884
Are we late?
Of course, you're late.

851
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:22,042
I'm Countess Nordston.

852
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:24,771
We nearly met at the
Shcherbatskys' last winter.

853
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,251
Come into the fold.

854
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:27,651
Come on.

855
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:33,124
You've been waiting for me.
Forgive me.

856
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,530
Kitty is here.

857
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:42,848
Konstantin, what a long time
since we saw each other.

858
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,931
Since you saw me, but I
saw you not so long ago.

859
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:47,241
When?

860
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:49,085
You were driving to Ergoshovo.

861
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:50,571
I was at Kashin
for the haymaking.

862
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:51,766
Oh, but why didn't you...

863
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,410
I'm so glad to see you.

864
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:55,890
You're just the same.

865
01:12:58,280 --> 01:12:59,566
I hope not.

866
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,443
I was young and silly
in those days.

867
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,290
Months and months ago.

868
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,491
And you haven't changed.

869
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:13,608
No. I haven't.

870
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:21,450
Permit me to announce,
um, soup Marie-Louise carp

871
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,522
with asparagus and roast beef.

872
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,523
I went to the market in person.

873
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:30,045
An extra place.

874
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:35,409
I've come to tell you our
connection must be severed.

875
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:37,885
I'm going to
divorce your sister.

876
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:40,401
Divorce?

877
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:44,163
Oh, dear me, what are you
talking about?

878
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:45,810
Well, don't be in a hurry.
Stay to dinner.

879
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,086
And later, you can talk
it over with Dolly.

880
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:49,003
Prince Oblonsky, everything
is over between our families.

881
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:51,890
Alexei, divorce is one thing.
Dinner is quite another.

882
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:55,763
You Petersburgers
think yourselves so <i>de bon ton</i>

883
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:58,810
compared with dull,
old-fashioned Moscow.

884
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:01,088
But we know how to do things.

885
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,247
Only the other day,

886
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:05,130
I hear Vasya Pryachnikov fought a
duel with Kvitsky and killed him.

887
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,247
Well, what...

888
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:07,924
What was the challenge about?

889
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,570
Pryachnikov's wife, naturally.

890
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:11,290
It was a matter
of honour, defending a woman's honour.

891
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:14,842
Sounds like barbarism to me. What if
the lover had killed the husband?

892
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:17,400
Would that have preserved
the wife's honour, too?

893
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:19,926
Still, not many of us can say
our lover died for love.

894
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,286
Love?

895
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:24,330
"Thou shall not covet
thy neighbour's wife."

896
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:36,529
Would you die for love,
Konstantin Dmitrievich?

897
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,888
I would. But not for
my neighbour's wife.

898
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,201
An impure love
is not love to me.

899
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:48,286
To admire another man's wife
is a pleasant thing,

900
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:51,811
but sensual desire indulged
for its own sake is greed,

901
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:53,724
a kind of gluttony,

902
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,730
and a misuse of something
sacred, which is given to us

903
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:00,009
so that we may choose the one person
with whom to fulfil our humanness.

904
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:04,650
Otherwise,
we might as well be cattle.

905
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:06,324
Ah! An idealist!

906
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:14,808
But she will be nobody's wife.

907
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:16,520
She'll be ruined.

908
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:20,091
I tried to save her.
She chose ruin.

909
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:22,006
Alexei Alexandrovich.

910
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:23,641
Look at me.

911
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:29,122
You will have no peace of mind
until you forgive her.

912
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:32,443
It was Anna who taught me that.

913
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,050
I do not wish to forgive.

914
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:35,929
I'm not a cruel man.

915
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,968
I've never hated anyone.

916
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,004
But I hate her with all my soul

917
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,481
for all the wrong
she has done me.

918
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:46,805
Now, it is your turn
to play us something, Countess.

919
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:48,888
I thought you'd never ask.

920
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,326
Very good.

921
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,368
Since we last met,

922
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:57,410
there is something I have
often wanted to ask you.

923
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:58,970
What is that?

924
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:10,491
This.

925
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:14,851
Do...

926
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:16,687
Not...

927
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:23,606
Did.

928
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,206
Did not.

929
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:41,128
The last word is "never."

930
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:50,645
I know what it says.

931
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:14,921
Then.

932
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:19,406
But now?

933
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,884
Can you forgive

934
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:32,051
and forget?

935
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:49,850
I never stopped.

936
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:11,609
Why doesn't he come?

937
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:15,684
He is kind.
He will forgive me.

938
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:19,840
Her fever is higher.

939
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:22,241
I want Alexei.
Why doesn't he come?

940
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:24,444
Give me some water.
No, I mustn't.

941
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:26,451
It isn't good
for my little girl.

942
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,364
Or let her have a nurse, yes.

943
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:31,406
Don't bring her here
because Alexei is coming

944
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:33,369
and it will hurt him
to see her.

945
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:35,562
He's come, my dear.
Look there.

946
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:38,441
Her deliverance
is still in God's hands.

947
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:41,922
You think he won't forgive
me but you don't know him.

948
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:44,808
No one knows him except me.

949
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:47,482
I'm not afraid of him, now.

950
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:51,649
I'm afraid of death, though.

951
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:55,567
Oh.

952
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:03,051
You poor man.

953
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:08,524
Let him come closer.

954
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:11,801
Alexei.

955
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,241
Alexei.

956
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:31,691
Look at my husband.

957
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:34,091
He's a saint.

958
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:36,525
Take his hand.

959
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:53,526
Thank God.

960
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:56,407
Thank God.

961
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:14,410
You must leave now.

962
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:18,170
I promise to send for you
if she asks for you.

963
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:21,721
I don't know
what happened to me.

964
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:24,770
I forgive you.
I forgive Anna.

965
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:29,248
My soul is filled with joy.

966
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,049
I will remain with her
and look after her forever.

967
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:40,606
Come now.

968
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:48,966
Come now.

969
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:51,165
Look at you.

970
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:54,929
You look like what you've become.
A laughingstock.

971
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:58,248
I fancy you will be asked
to leave the regiment.

972
01:22:58,320 --> 01:22:59,765
I would like you to go, <i>Maman.</i>

973
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,444
I'll go when I'm ready to go.

974
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:03,963
A little affair
with a married woman

975
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:05,849
puts a finishing touch
to a young man's education.

976
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:08,321
But this morbid,
selfish obsession...

977
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:09,761
You've publicly
humiliated yourself

978
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:12,041
and dishonoured a man who has
devoted his life to Russia.

979
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:15,370
So you'd better come back
to Moscow with me.

980
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,329
You're finished here.

981
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,846
And there was her husband,
wearing her best ball gown.

982
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:42,968
Rouge all over his face.

983
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,329
<i>Ma chére, le scandale!</i>

984
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:51,250
But I'd better tell you
some regimental news.

985
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:52,527
Who is here?

986
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:56,685
Princess Elisabeth Federovna
Tverskaya, Your Excellency.

987
01:23:57,480 --> 01:23:58,925
I don't want to see him.

988
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:02,006
But surely your husband
wouldn't stop...

989
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:04,246
I'm so glad to see you.

990
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:05,401
You look feverish.

991
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:07,448
We've been talking too much,
so I'm going.

992
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,363
Princess Betsy
came to tell me...

993
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:12,329
I don't want to hide
anything from you.

994
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:15,763
Count Vronsky asked to come to say goodbye.
He's going away.

995
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:21,166
I've told him
that I can't receive him.

996
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:25,450
Well, goodbye, my treasure.

997
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:49,165
I agree with you.

998
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:51,641
As he is going away, there's no
need for Count Vronsky to come.

999
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:53,609
I just said so, so there's
no need to repeat it.

1000
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:54,966
But it is for you to decide.

1001
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:57,168
Yes, and I decided.

1002
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:58,241
Then I am very glad that...

1003
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:01,005
That we agree, so perhaps we
can stop talking about it.

1004
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:03,890
Of course. ls there
anything I can do for you?

1005
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:08,443
Yes, can you please, please, please
stop cracking your knuckles?

1006
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:15,370
I'm a bad woman.

1007
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,164
But I can't breathe.

1008
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:24,207
Your kindness, which I can't
repay, and your forgiveness...

1009
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:27,045
You begged me
for my forgiveness.

1010
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:28,645
But I didn't die, and now
I have to live with it.

1011
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:31,451
Then what? What do you want?

1012
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:34,683
Do you know what you want? Do
you want to see Count Vronsky?

1013
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:36,808
Not to say goodbye.

1014
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:41,565
I can't hear.

1015
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:44,164
Not to say goodbye.

1016
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:50,731
You would be lost.
Irretrievably lost.

1017
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:53,289
You would have no position.

1018
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:56,682
And worse, if we divorce,
you would be the guilty party.

1019
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:59,240
That means you cannot
legally remarry.

1020
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:02,608
Your union with Count Vronsky
would be illegitimate,

1021
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:05,160
as would your daughter, who now
has the protection of my name.

1022
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:07,163
And this is what you want?

1023
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:12,328
It would be a sin
to help you destroy yourself.

1024
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:14,129
You forget something.

1025
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:19,001
Count Vronsky and I
love each other.

1026
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:24,131
And this love sanctifies
a criminal folly?

1027
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:25,964
All I know
is that I sent him away

1028
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:28,441
and it's as if I'd shot
myself through the heart!

1029
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:33,685
I see.

1030
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:39,404
And what of Serozha?

1031
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:43,529
I would die for him,

1032
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:46,921
but I won't live
like this for him.

1033
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:51,325
When he knows of love,
he will forgive me.

1034
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:57,567
Then I must choose
the smaller sin.

1035
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:02,041
Vronsky has robbed me of my cloak
and I will give him my coat.

1036
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:03,486
No, I...

1037
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:32,368
My darling. My darling.

1038
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:36,127
You look so pale.

1039
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:37,690
Oh, my darling.

1040
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:41,931
We'll go south
to the sea air and sunshine.

1041
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:47,524
Is it all right?
Sit down a minute.

1042
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:50,523
I want to see everything.

1043
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,240
A moment.

1044
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:00,082
And now I'm doing
kitchenmaid's work

1045
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:02,925
because Nadya's parents won't
let her set foot in the house.

1046
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,480
And who can blame them?
It's indecent.

1047
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:44,490
It's Konstantin.

1048
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:47,366
Yes, good.

1049
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:50,242
The doctor here is useless.

1050
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:52,963
Get me one from Moscow.

1051
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,004
Where did you go?

1052
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:00,888
I asked for you everywhere
when I was getting married.

1053
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:10,961
I'm sorry.
I couldn't leave him.

1054
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:13,806
Yes. My wife...

1055
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:17,290
You can't stay now.

1056
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:23,362
I will nurse him with Agafia.

1057
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:26,169
The woman will find
somewhere in the village.

1058
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:27,890
You won't see her.

1059
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:31,166
She knows it is impossible
to meet you.

1060
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:34,687
It is a torment to me that I've
brought you under the same roof

1061
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:37,730
as this unfortunate...
As this fallen...

1062
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:40,966
And in your precious,
delicate condition.

1063
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:43,931
Oh, Kostya.

1064
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:49,406
Good. A clean nightshirt
and sheets.

1065
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:52,051
A towel and a clean
pail of warm water.

1066
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:53,681
Wait.

1067
01:30:58,720 --> 01:30:59,880
And bring the perfume bottle,

1068
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:02,846
in the outside pocket
of my handbag.

1069
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:20,811
Twenty-one to Stremov, four to Karenin.
The motion is carried.

1070
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:41,442
Alexei, they're back.

1071
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:44,129
Here, in St Petersburg.

1072
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:46,285
She has written to me.

1073
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:48,167
To you?

1074
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:01,850
They think I don't have
the right to refuse.

1075
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:03,686
It's the boy's birthday.

1076
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:05,685
My friend,

1077
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:11,481
you would be blowing on the embers of
a fire which must be allowed to die.

1078
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:15,365
Let me write to her.

1079
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:00,569
I'm here to see Serozha.

1080
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:03,841
<i>Madame?</i>

1081
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:10,281
I beg your pardon,
Your Excellency.

1082
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:16,728
No, I've come to see Serozha.

1083
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:36,204
Serozha.

1084
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:37,646
<i>Maman?</i>

1085
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:38,761
Oh.

1086
01:34:39,320 --> 01:34:40,651
My dear little boy.

1087
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:42,529
I knew you would come.

1088
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:44,400
Today is my birthday.

1089
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:45,891
I know.

1090
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:48,204
Are you crying?

1091
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:49,406
No, I won't cry.

1092
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:51,480
Where did you go, <i>Maman?</i>

1093
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:53,204
I don't know.

1094
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:55,243
Everywhere. The south.

1095
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:58,728
I thought about you every day.

1096
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:02,211
And I thought
about you every day.

1097
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:07,126
And you must love Papa.
He's better than I am.

1098
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:10,044
No one in the whole world
is better than you.

1099
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:28,481
No.

1100
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:03,280
Where's Anya?

1101
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:05,044
She's still asleep.

1102
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:08,443
Should I take your coat?

1103
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:13,443
Are you feeling unwell, madam?

1104
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:15,090
I'm not sleeping.

1105
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:17,768
I can send out for something.

1106
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:19,481
Yes.

1107
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:42,729
Why are you in the dark?

1108
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:45,891
Yashvin is going to call.
You remember him.

1109
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:47,247
Are you going out?

1110
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:49,040
To where?

1111
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:51,361
To whom?

1112
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:53,284
What's the matter?

1113
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:55,565
I didn't know
what happened to you.

1114
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:57,080
But I told you
yesterday. My brother.

1115
01:36:57,120 --> 01:36:59,805
Does it take all day
to meet your brother?

1116
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:02,048
Does he need you
more than I do?

1117
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:03,891
What's happened?

1118
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:10,002
Well, Alexander agreed
to everything.

1119
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:11,730
Mother's house in Moscow
will goto him,

1120
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:14,610
and the country estate
will be our new home.

1121
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:19,123
As soon as the divorce.

1122
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:23,126
Karenin hasn't answered
your letter yet?

1123
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:29,967
You're the very first person to
call on me since our return.

1124
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:32,247
I received a note
from Princess Betsy

1125
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:35,130
asking me to call on her
between 6:30 and 8:00.

1126
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:36,770
Or was it 7:00?

1127
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:39,566
But perhaps you'll meet
at the opera tonight.

1128
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:41,529
I would love to be there
if I could get a box.

1129
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:43,330
Madame, your box
is number four.

1130
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:46,246
You'll find me there
with Princess Myagkaya.

1131
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:48,286
Will you come, Vronsky?

1132
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:55,171
Well... I see why Alexei
is so fond of you.

1133
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:03,890
You know you can't
go to the theatre.

1134
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:05,644
Annushka!
For heaven's sake.

1135
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:07,006
A bath! I'll come in
and choose a dress.

1136
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:08,127
Anna, I implore you.

1137
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:10,487
I'm not ashamed of who I am
or what I've done.

1138
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,244
Are you ashamed for me?

1139
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:14,926
Why don't you book
a room at the hotel?

1140
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,650
Aren't we together?

1141
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:18,401
Have you changed towards me?

1142
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:19,891
It's because I love you
and care about you.

1143
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:21,724
If that's the case, then I don't
know why you aren't coming with me.

1144
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:22,801
That would make it worse.

1145
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:24,325
You're afraid.

1146
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:26,125
Well, I'm not.

1147
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:05,408
Should we visit, or stay put?

1148
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:07,246
Stay put.

1149
01:39:09,720 --> 01:39:12,087
Minister! Congratulations.

1150
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:14,449
Come in for a moment.

1151
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:35,402
Princess
Sorokina and her daughter.

1152
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:38,689
They're from Moscow, neighbours
of Count Vronsky's mother.

1153
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:42,128
Quite well off. No sons.
She's a widow.

1154
01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:46,283
My dear, I'm a sales catalogue.

1155
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:55,441
Alexei.

1156
01:39:57,960 --> 01:40:00,361
You'll come up
to see us afterwards?

1157
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:02,489
I'll talk to Varya.

1158
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:07,726
Will you call on Anna?

1159
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:11,162
Oh. Alexei. I'm fond of...

1160
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:12,241
For God's sake!

1161
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:15,521
Anna isn't a criminal.

1162
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:18,444
I'd call on her if she'd
only broken the law.

1163
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:21,043
But she broke the rules.

1164
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:38,889
Who has made the decor?
Haven't we got a programme?

1165
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:40,645
Colonel, would you be so kind?

1166
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:41,721
Of course.

1167
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:45,202
Please, I would be honoured
if you would take mine.

1168
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:47,209
Thank you. How very...

1169
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:50,721
It's a disgrace.

1170
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:52,165
Hush, dear.
A common courtesy.

1171
01:40:56,840 --> 01:40:58,444
Everyone's looking.

1172
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:01,251
Let them look!
Fetch my cloak.

1173
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,809
What are we coming to?

1174
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:06,845
It's an insult to decency.
Take me home.

1175
01:41:06,920 --> 01:41:10,242
Hush. I beg you, my dear.
It was only a word or two.

1176
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:11,840
I have a word or two
for some people

1177
01:41:11,880 --> 01:41:13,721
one didn't expect
to be rubbing shoulders with.

1178
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:18,127
She has a nerve, flaunting
herself like a slut in society.

1179
01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:23,526
Yes, why don't you?

1180
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:25,841
Rescue her and put your
seal on the fiasco.

1181
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:42,126
Alexei,

1182
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:44,489
you see why she must divorce.

1183
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:48,603
Marriage will solve everything.
When will it be?

1184
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:50,603
As far as I'm concerned,
she's my wife.

1185
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:52,603
As you saw, she isn't.

1186
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:56,404
We're going to Moscow, then
to my place in the country.

1187
01:41:56,960 --> 01:41:58,371
That sounds like a good idea.

1188
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:00,240
But, for a day or two,
Anna will be at home.

1189
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:03,407
Then...

1190
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:06,929
I'll say goodbye now.

1191
01:42:25,880 --> 01:42:28,121
Well, you had
an excellent night.

1192
01:42:30,120 --> 01:42:32,566
Does your mother want you to
marry the widow or the child?

1193
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:35,528
Either one.
Don't joke about it.

1194
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:39,241
If you loved me, you would have
locked me in to stop me going!

1195
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:56,244
Yes, it was my fault.

1196
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:10,605
I won't sleep.

1197
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:16,408
I know how to make you sleep.

1198
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:12,083
Anna, I am very glad
to see you.

1199
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:14,721
Are you well?
How is your little one?

1200
01:44:16,440 --> 01:44:19,410
Stiva wanted to invite you and
Count Vronsky to the house,

1201
01:44:19,480 --> 01:44:21,005
but it's impossible.

1202
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:22,570
No, I understand.

1203
01:44:22,640 --> 01:44:24,483
No. No, you don't.

1204
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:27,322
Kitty and her husband
are with us.

1205
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:29,249
She's in Moscow
to have the baby.

1206
01:44:29,320 --> 01:44:32,483
Kitty! Tell her
how pleased I am.

1207
01:44:33,160 --> 01:44:35,367
Perhaps I'll wait
a year or two.

1208
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:38,201
Love.

1209
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:41,326
Yes, love.

1210
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:48,448
Don't you disapprove of me
for what I've done?

1211
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,970
No. I wish I'd done the same.

1212
01:44:52,440 --> 01:44:54,169
But no one asked me.

1213
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:58,808
Well, I wouldn't have been
brave enough.

1214
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:02,004
Stiva, you know,

1215
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:04,204
he doesn't change.

1216
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:07,129
Like all men, I suppose.

1217
01:46:06,160 --> 01:46:07,650
I had an inspiration.

1218
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:08,966
Why do we have to wait here?

1219
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:10,769
Why can't we wait
in the country?

1220
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:13,002
I don't want to hear any more about
a divorce or think about it.

1221
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:14,650
Good, I'm bored here.
When should we go?

1222
01:46:15,120 --> 01:46:17,040
If I bore you here,
I'll bore you in the country.

1223
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:19,566
I didn't say you bore me, Moscow bores me.
When should we go? Tomorrow?

1224
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:21,160
I can't be ready by tomorrow.

1225
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:22,366
The day after, then.
If you like.

1226
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:25,290
No, wait, that's Sunday.
I have to see <i>Maman.</i>

1227
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:27,000
That's 20 minutes away
on the train.

1228
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:29,124
You could go
to see her tomorrow.

1229
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:32,971
Or was it that you wanted to spend
Sunday with Princess Sorokina?

1230
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:35,328
Please.
Don't spoil everything.

1231
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:39,081
I can't see Maman tomorrow because she won't
have read the papers she has to sign.

1232
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:40,810
In that case, let's not bother.

1233
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:42,723
I'll leave on Sunday or not at all.
That's absurd.

1234
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:45,521
It's absurd to you because you have
no understanding of my life here.

1235
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:48,247
Anna. No, you've
stopped loving me.

1236
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:51,520
You've given up everything for me
and it's turned you against me.

1237
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:53,284
Why lie about it?
Stop!

1238
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:55,806
I put off our departure for a day or
two and you tell me I don't love you.

1239
01:46:56,200 --> 01:46:57,964
Because I've been living off
your love and there's none left.

1240
01:46:58,040 --> 01:46:59,121
So this is over. Finished.

1241
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:13,886
I'm sorry.

1242
01:47:23,560 --> 01:47:24,800
I don't mind when we go.

1243
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:27,042
I'll telegraph <i>Maman.</i>
We'll go on Sunday.

1244
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:28,890
I'll do anything you want.

1245
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:32,010
You should leave me. I don't want to.
I love you.

1246
01:47:32,680 --> 01:47:33,681
Why?

1247
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:37,730
You can't ask "why" about love.

1248
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:04,762
So, will you be all packed?

1249
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:07,448
I'll be out today
making the arrangements.

1250
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:09,249
Is that your way of telling
me you'll be at your mother's

1251
01:48:09,320 --> 01:48:10,560
with that simpering
little princess?

1252
01:48:10,640 --> 01:48:13,405
No. I'll be at my lawyer's,
waiting for some documents.

1253
01:48:13,480 --> 01:48:15,289
Then I'm having dinner to say
goodbye to old comrades.

1254
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:16,361
I know what that means.

1255
01:48:16,440 --> 01:48:18,841
My God, this is unendurable!

1256
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:21,806
I can invite them here,
if you like.

1257
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:24,611
Thank you, but if I'm not fit to dine
in society, I won't eat with the band.

1258
01:48:24,680 --> 01:48:28,127
Who was the telegram from?

1259
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:31,166
I didn't show you because Stiva keeps
telegraphing what we already know.

1260
01:48:31,240 --> 01:48:32,810
Karenin promises nothing,
but will consider...

1261
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:35,850
I told you I don't care about the
divorce, so why hide the telegram?

1262
01:48:46,160 --> 01:48:48,731
Is there anything
you wish to say to me?

1263
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:23,564
So it's the child.

1264
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:25,765
She brought papers from <i>Maman.</i>

1265
01:49:30,680 --> 01:49:31,761
Anna.

1266
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:52,001
No.

1267
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:18,531
Oh, God.

1268
01:53:18,680 --> 01:53:20,603
Forgive me.

1269
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:58,811
I'll be buying in feed
before winter's over.

1270
01:53:58,920 --> 01:54:02,322
Well, you don't press people
hard, but you live rightly.

1271
01:54:03,120 --> 01:54:05,521
For your soul, not your belly.

1272
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:10,009
How do we know what's rightly?

1273
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:12,561
Just by knowing it.
How else?

1274
01:54:13,320 --> 01:54:16,403
But I believe in reason.

1275
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:20,043
Reason. Was it reason that
made you choose your wife?

1276
01:54:46,120 --> 01:54:47,929
I came looking for you.

1277
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:51,810
I understood something.

1278
01:54:52,120 --> 01:54:54,009
What did you understand?

1279
01:55:06,760 --> 01:55:08,285
He smiled at me.

1280
01:55:08,440 --> 01:55:10,602
He's very advanced for his age.

1281
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:15,329
What did you understand?

1282
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:33,729
I'm so proud of you.

1283
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:35,404
Night-night.

1284
01:55:49,360 --> 01:55:50,407
And you, too.

1285
01:55:50,480 --> 01:55:52,881
