00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:58,434
-What iust happened?

-Seriously.
-You are not doing it.

6
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:03,968
-Fix it. You're the computer whiz.
-Come on, do it!

7
00:02:05,499 --> 00:02:06,833
Well, what happened?

8
00:02:07,499 --> 00:02:09,167
Hong Kong server was iust hacked.

11

And Barcelona.

12
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:18,468
Quadruple redundancy, plus a spare.

13
00:02:19,532 --> 00:02:21,367
Excellent work, my precious ones.

14
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:26,466
Okay, it's on.

15
00:02:33,532 --> 00:02:35,600
Did you see that one?

16
00:02:37,632 --> 00:02:39,200
Oh, my God!

17
00:02:39,466 --> 00:02:41,134
-Hey! What?
-That is so gross.

18
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,800
-l so iust came a little.
-Right, yeah.

19
00:02:46,265 --> 00:02:47,966
-Dude!
-Follow him.

20
00:02:48,899 --> 00:02:49,899
Closer.

22
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:57,700
Go.

23
00:03:28,899 --> 00:03:30,700
-Did you see that?
-Oh, my gosh.

24
00:03:55,265 --> 00:03:59,035
-Right in the back! That was fantastic.
-Right in the back, are you kidding me?

25
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,068
l'm not betting against Ripper anymore.

26
00:04:08,132 --> 00:04:09,566
Now it gets really fucked up.

27
00:04:09,632 --> 00:04:12,267
Are you kidding me?
Like it hasn't been already?

28
00:04:15,866 --> 00:04:18,868
Live or die. Live or die.

29
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:20,467
All right, kill or stay?

30
00:04:21,165 --> 00:04:22,466
-Kill him. Kill him.
-Kill him.

31
00:04:22,532 --> 00:04:23,599
Why not, right?

32
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:26,135
-l mean, dude, he's lost us 100 bucks.
-Let's do it.

33
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:28,433
-Kill.
-Kill, l guess.

34
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,501
Survey says...

35
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:37,802
Mr. Executioner, come on down!

36
00:04:47,232 --> 00:04:48,232
Finish him.

37
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,533
Now!

38
00:05:11,499 --> 00:05:13,400
He didn't even cut it offwith the first one!

39
00:05:13,466 --> 00:05:16,335
-He didn't even cut it off!
-God, this is so gross, you guys!

40
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,168
-This is so gross.
-God. It makes me giddy in my underpants.

41
00:05:20,132 --> 00:05:21,366
Come on.

42
00:05:21,432 --> 00:05:23,534
This isn't real, is it?

43
00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:26,101
No, no, it's like the movies.
It's special effects and stuff.

44
00:05:26,165 --> 00:05:27,633
Smoke and mirrors, yeah, it's...

45
00:05:27,733 --> 00:05:31,269
No, no, no. No, l heard it was real.
l mean, if it was fake, it'd be on TV.

46
00:05:31,366 --> 00:05:32,967
-What? You're so stupid.
-Yeah, right.

47
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:34,333
-There's no way.
-Seriously.

48
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:36,300
My brother-in-law's friend works for the FBl.

49
00:05:36,366 --> 00:05:38,101
Says they're looking
for the guy that runs this thing.

50
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,600
Hey.

51
00:06:29,232 --> 00:06:30,399
Sorry.

52
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:33,800
That's better.

53
00:06:34,332 --> 00:06:35,666
How did my gallant warrior do?

54
00:06:36,132 --> 00:06:37,366
Total slaughter.

55
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:38,933
No mercy given?

56
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,401
None taken.

57
00:06:42,232 --> 00:06:43,733
What was the score?

58
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:45,100
A lot to a little.

59
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:47,634
Defensive struggle?

60
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,834
Always. You ready?

61
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:51,100
Yeah.

62
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:56,666
Thank you.

63
00:06:58,366 --> 00:07:00,501
l was watching, to be honest.

64
00:07:15,966 --> 00:07:18,501
You're gonna miss these moments.

65
00:07:18,566 --> 00:07:21,669
Waves of nausea
followed by crippling cramps?

66
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,434
Somehow l doubt that.

67
00:07:23,499 --> 00:07:25,234
Okay, but when you're 50,

68
00:07:25,299 --> 00:07:28,301
don't get all teary-eyed
reminiscing about those pregnant days

69
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:29,500
and how you miss them.

70
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,700
You're such a man.

71
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:33,533
You think you know everything,

72
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,868
but you know nothing of
the inner workings ofthe female body.

73
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:38,267
But you still have to give your opinion.

74
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:41,068
And expect everyone to accept it as fact.

75
00:07:41,466 --> 00:07:43,935
l know to bail on this conversation.

76
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,234
Yeah. Good thinking.

77
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:47,700
David!

78
00:07:49,299 --> 00:07:51,167
-You all right?
-Yeah.

79
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:14,233
Lori.

80
00:08:21,966 --> 00:08:23,467
Baby?

81
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:52,533
David, l'm sorry.

82
00:10:10,699 --> 00:10:14,869
l don't speak Mexican, senoríta.

83
00:10:16,065 --> 00:10:18,600
No sleeping in the bar. You understand that?

84
00:10:35,332 --> 00:10:39,869
Just give me another bottle of...

85
00:10:41,165 --> 00:10:42,799
Whatever it is l'm drinking, okay?

86
00:10:43,232 --> 00:10:44,399
Okay.

87
00:10:44,466 --> 00:10:45,700
lt's for you.

88
00:10:49,132 --> 00:10:50,800
Where's the head at?

89
00:10:50,866 --> 00:10:52,467
lt's over there.

90
00:10:55,099 --> 00:10:56,300
Yeah.

91
00:10:56,966 --> 00:10:58,934
One more, please.

92
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:06,933
Hello.

93
00:11:09,532 --> 00:11:10,699
Hey.

94
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,300
Where's my drink?

95
00:12:26,366 --> 00:12:27,700
l don't smoke.

96
00:12:28,265 --> 00:12:30,133
But you do speak French.

97
00:12:33,232 --> 00:12:34,566
What happened to your face?

98
00:12:36,432 --> 00:12:39,101
Life sucks. Scars happen.

99
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:43,168
You know,
this is the third bar l've seen you in.

100
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:48,503
You like to flash those big bills
or perhaps you have a Mexican death wish.

101
00:12:50,099 --> 00:12:51,533
You traveling alone?

102
00:12:52,032 --> 00:12:53,533
What business is it to you?

103
00:12:55,366 --> 00:12:56,900
None, really.

104
00:12:57,599 --> 00:13:01,035
But from what l saw in there,
l thought we could make ourselves

105
00:13:01,099 --> 00:13:02,867
not so lonely.

106
00:13:36,699 --> 00:13:40,169
l hope you have a nicer place
than this shithole to fuck your wife.

107
00:13:42,332 --> 00:13:44,333
Not that l'm complaining.

108
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,368
l'm not married.

109
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,768
What? She leave you?

110
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,733
She's dead.

111
00:14:04,032 --> 00:14:05,600
Then l guess she won't be missing you.

112
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:27,733
l've got something for you here.

113
00:15:04,933 --> 00:15:08,236
Check him for tracking devices.
If you find anything, dump his corpse.

114
00:15:11,132 --> 00:15:12,600
Make sure you're not followed.

115
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,234
Hello?

116
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,766
Hello?

117
00:16:08,099 --> 00:16:09,333
Don't draw attention.

118
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,234
Who's there?

119
00:16:13,499 --> 00:16:14,900
Over here.

120
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:20,200
Where am l?

121
00:16:22,299 --> 00:16:23,533
Hell.

122
00:16:28,265 --> 00:16:30,767
What ís the one thíng
we all have ín common?

123
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,267
Death.

124
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:38,070
The only questíons are how and when
the Grím Reaper wíll vísít.

125
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:42,001
A problem you need not
worry about any longer.

126
00:16:46,232 --> 00:16:47,833
Thís poínt forward,

127
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,100
your lífe ísn't yours anymore.

128
00:16:50,866 --> 00:16:52,300
lt belongs to me.

129
00:16:53,332 --> 00:16:55,300
You are no longer Davíd Lord.

130
00:16:55,499 --> 00:16:57,367
He ceases to exíst.

131
00:16:58,366 --> 00:17:01,268
Your name ís Death Dealer.

132
00:17:02,065 --> 00:17:03,499
You were bred to fíght.

And to díe.

135
00:17:07,232 --> 00:17:08,800
Who are you?

136
00:17:08,866 --> 00:17:11,001
Do what you were born to do, Death Dealer,

137
00:17:11,399 --> 00:17:13,868
and your demíse wíll be one of glory.

138
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,334
Resíst,

139
00:17:16,399 --> 00:17:21,270
and l promíse you paín ín the líkes of whích
you never could conceíve ímagínable.

140
00:17:21,866 --> 00:17:23,500
What do you want?

141
00:17:25,733 --> 00:17:27,501
Help! Hello?

142
00:17:28,399 --> 00:17:30,134
Somebody help me!

143
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:31,400
Let me out!

144
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,401
Your name ís Death Dealer.

145
00:17:49,466 --> 00:17:51,034
What are you doing?

146
00:17:51,099 --> 00:17:52,333
You were bred to fíght.

147
00:17:53,165 --> 00:17:54,833
To kíll. To díe.

148

Your name ís Death Dealer.
You were bred to fíght.

151
00:18:03,866 --> 00:18:06,301
Kíll, kíll, kíll. Your name ís... Díe.

152
00:19:13,099 --> 00:19:15,901
So, what do we know about him?

153
00:19:16,466 --> 00:19:17,867
He's a fireman from Denver.

154
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:19,567
l thought he was a doctor.

155
00:19:19,632 --> 00:19:21,834
He has a paramedic license.
He's not a doctor.

156
00:19:22,366 --> 00:19:23,433
Family?

157
00:19:23,532 --> 00:19:25,433
Wife, deceased.

158
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:27,601
He's a fucking doctor.

159
00:19:28,165 --> 00:19:31,234
At least the last guy she grabbed was
a competitive kendo artist.

160
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:33,701
Well, this guy is a fireman, okay?

161
00:19:33,766 --> 00:19:37,870
Have you seen him? He's, like, 85 kilograms.

162
00:19:37,933 --> 00:19:39,000
-1 86...
-Milla.

163
00:19:42,132 --> 00:19:45,668
-He'll fight.
-He's fucking useless. He's a piece of shit.

164
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:47,700
lt's so typical of you, Milla.

165
00:19:47,766 --> 00:19:49,067
My dear Kaden.

166
00:19:49,132 --> 00:19:52,502
He's been in your care for three days
and he's yet to give you the time of day.

167
00:19:54,132 --> 00:19:57,869
Maybe Kaden's tired old shtick
won't break him.

168
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,635
l'll guarantee you
he'll respond to a little honey instead.

169
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:03,333
Dirty, fucking whore.

170
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:06,168
He's my fighter. l recruited him.

171
00:20:06,232 --> 00:20:08,267
lt's my risk, my responsibility.

172
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:12,769
May l remind both ofyou
they are all my fighters.

173
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,234
And this is my world.

174
00:20:15,332 --> 00:20:16,700
But you're absolutely right, Milla.

175
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,500
lt's your risk.

176
00:20:18,966 --> 00:20:20,267
lt's also your ass.

177
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:23,434
Well, he'll fight and he'll win.

178
00:20:26,899 --> 00:20:28,166
Do whatever it takes.

179
00:20:28,632 --> 00:20:29,899
Just make sure he fights.

180
00:21:34,532 --> 00:21:35,866
What's your name?

181
00:21:36,532 --> 00:21:39,534
You want my real name
or the one they gave me?

182
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:41,299
The real one.

183
00:21:42,065 --> 00:21:45,067
Morí. Taíga Morí.

184
00:21:46,165 --> 00:21:47,633
l'm from Osaka.

185
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,400
You don't sound Japanese.

l studíed archítecture at Harvard.

187

Firefighterlparamedic from Denver.

189
00:22:03,232 --> 00:22:04,399
You hurt?

190
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:10,667
We're going to die here, David Lord.

191
00:22:10,933 --> 00:22:13,101
Nah, nah, don't talk like that.

192
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:15,668
My wife, Akiko,

193
00:22:17,432 --> 00:22:19,567
she used to say that l was the strong one.

194
00:22:20,733 --> 00:22:25,671
The survívor. But l'm not. l'm weak.

195
00:22:26,099 --> 00:22:27,099
l'm tíred.

196
00:22:28,466 --> 00:22:29,800
And l'm angry.

197
00:22:29,866 --> 00:22:32,168
And all l want to do
is kill those motherfuckers!

198
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:35,501
Showtime.

199
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:53,001
Hold your breath! Hold!

200
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,334
-Tough it up!
-Tough it up!

201
00:23:35,432 --> 00:23:37,200
You look like shit.

202
00:23:38,766 --> 00:23:41,802
The magic cocktail
is already whispering in your ear.

203
00:23:42,466 --> 00:23:43,700
Why are you doing this?

204
00:23:44,199 --> 00:23:45,733
What's your name?

205
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,234
David Lord.

206
00:23:57,199 --> 00:23:59,367
What were you going to name your child?

207
00:23:59,432 --> 00:24:01,233
Leave my family out of this.

208
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:04,435
Your wife, she's pretty.

209
00:24:05,866 --> 00:24:08,001
Such a pity she's gone.

210
00:24:11,566 --> 00:24:15,503
ln the Marines, how many men, women
and children did you kill?

211
00:24:18,132 --> 00:24:19,600
No matter.

212
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,734
'Cause you aren't prepared
for what's about to happen.

213
00:24:23,132 --> 00:24:25,601
Whether you live or die.

214
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:29,567
How will you live or die?

215
00:24:31,566 --> 00:24:32,867
lt's your choice.

216
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,599
What?

217
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:40,667
-You want me?
-l'd love to get my hands on you.

218
00:24:40,733 --> 00:24:42,367
That's the spirit.

219
00:24:51,165 --> 00:24:52,299
No, no, no, no!

220
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:27,334
New guy doesn't stand a chance.

221
00:25:28,699 --> 00:25:29,866
Yoshi.

222
00:25:30,632 --> 00:25:33,634
We need to talk about your TPS reports.

223
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:36,768
Yeah. The cover sheets.

224
00:25:37,666 --> 00:25:39,200
l know. l know.

225
00:25:52,699 --> 00:25:55,968
Home again, home again.

226
00:25:56,933 --> 00:25:59,302
And how are my two beauties this fine day?

227
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:01,667
-Ready to go.
-Ready to go.

228
00:26:01,733 --> 00:26:03,134
Magnificent.

229
00:26:03,199 --> 00:26:04,867
Let's make something special, shall we?

230
00:26:09,899 --> 00:26:11,500
What is your name?

231
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:14,568
David Lord.

232
00:26:21,132 --> 00:26:25,169
No. Your name is Death Dealer.

233
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,368
Now l'm gonna ask you again.

234
00:26:28,499 --> 00:26:32,936
What is your name?

235
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:39,767
lnput a six-second delay.

236
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:42,534
Link the video screen.

237
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:45,267
Ladies, if you will.

238
00:26:46,065 --> 00:26:47,466
Lights.

239
00:26:51,132 --> 00:26:52,500
Lay in graphics.

240
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:56,668
Marvelous!

241
00:26:57,332 --> 00:27:01,135
Outstanding. You've outdone yourselves,
my little pearls.

242
00:27:01,499 --> 00:27:07,338
We are going live in three, two, one.
Cue music.

243
00:27:41,566 --> 00:27:43,801
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
l'm not gonna fight!

244
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:49,000
Boring.

245
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:21,034
What a coward.

246
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,368
lf l was a betting man, Milla, and l am,

247
00:28:24,432 --> 00:28:26,934
l'd say you're going to lose this one.

248
00:28:43,499 --> 00:28:45,400
-No.
-Get up, get up, get up!

249
00:28:49,165 --> 00:28:50,766
Ladies, please, do something.

250
00:28:50,833 --> 00:28:52,834
My lids are getting heavy.
l'm falling asleep here.

251
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:25,901
-Yeah!
-Dude.

252
00:29:30,065 --> 00:29:31,466
He's shit.

253
00:29:32,532 --> 00:29:33,532
What?

254
00:29:44,733 --> 00:29:46,501
Well, l'll be damned.

255
00:29:55,632 --> 00:29:57,700
Oh, my God!

256
00:29:58,099 --> 00:30:01,602
lt is now time for the Fan-atics to vote.

257
00:30:03,032 --> 00:30:04,466
Survey says...

258
00:30:06,232 --> 00:30:09,468
Mr. Executioner, come on down!

259
00:30:09,632 --> 00:30:12,468
l'm a paramedic.
l'm gonna stop the bleeding.

260
00:30:15,099 --> 00:30:16,200
What's he doing?

261
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,200
l've got a chíld.

262
00:30:22,632 --> 00:30:24,400
l'm David Lord and l've been kidnapped!

263
00:30:25,766 --> 00:30:27,400
Cut the audio. Cue music.

264
00:30:29,165 --> 00:30:31,934
Can you smell it? It's iust like sweetness.

265
00:30:32,232 --> 00:30:33,566
Naughty boy.

266
00:30:33,733 --> 00:30:35,468
Get him out ofthere, please.

267
00:30:44,432 --> 00:30:50,371
And we are out in three, two, one.

268
00:30:51,566 --> 00:30:56,003
Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant show.

269
00:30:56,065 --> 00:30:59,835
You were marvelous.
And you were marvelous.

270
00:31:12,499 --> 00:31:13,733
Hey!

271
00:31:13,866 --> 00:31:15,767
Stop right there!

272
00:31:17,132 --> 00:31:19,400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

273
00:31:19,466 --> 00:31:22,168
He's an embarrassment.
l should have cut him in half there and then.

274
00:31:22,232 --> 00:31:23,733
No, no, no, no!

275
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:26,535
You are not going to kill him!

276
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:27,800
Yes, l am.

277
00:31:27,866 --> 00:31:30,235
Kaden, be reasonable.

278
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,402
Reasonable? This cunt deserves to die.

279
00:31:35,466 --> 00:31:37,601
Yes he does, but not this way.

280
00:31:37,933 --> 00:31:39,668
lt's wasted if he dies off camera.

281
00:31:39,733 --> 00:31:40,767
Fuck the cameras!

282
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,833
Kaden, where's your sense of adventure?

283
00:31:44,366 --> 00:31:45,500
He wronged me.

284
00:31:45,566 --> 00:31:48,001
He wronged us!

285
00:31:48,065 --> 00:31:52,002
Look, l want to hold his head
on the chopping block for you.

286
00:31:52,065 --> 00:31:53,966
But we can break him.
We can make him fight.

287
00:31:54,265 --> 00:31:55,933
We can make him fight for us.

288
00:31:56,265 --> 00:31:57,599
On our stage.

289
00:32:00,199 --> 00:32:01,266
And if he won't?

290
00:32:02,366 --> 00:32:06,103
Then you get your wish. Fuck the cameras.

291
00:32:31,733 --> 00:32:34,068
So, there we were.

292
00:32:34,132 --> 00:32:39,036
Akiko got a headache from the flight,
so she went out to get some Aspirin.

293
00:32:43,366 --> 00:32:46,001
That was the last time l ever saw her.

294
00:32:50,366 --> 00:32:51,900
Searched the city for days.

295
00:32:53,265 --> 00:32:57,268
Contacted the authorities,
the embassy. Nothing.

296
00:32:58,332 --> 00:33:00,067
There was no trace of her.

297
00:33:02,132 --> 00:33:03,233
And then l got a phone call.

298
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,168
lt was the first time l ever heard that voice.

299
00:33:09,399 --> 00:33:10,566
And she said

300
00:33:11,666 --> 00:33:15,536
if l ever wanted to see my wife alive,

301
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:18,268
l should do exactly what she says.

302
00:33:19,432 --> 00:33:21,567
lt's so fucking cliché!

303
00:33:23,766 --> 00:33:27,369
l should have known something was up
when she never asked for a ransom.

304
00:33:29,699 --> 00:33:33,502
She told me to go to this bar outside the city.

305
00:33:34,232 --> 00:33:35,666
To go alone.

306
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,634
But when l got there,

307
00:33:40,966 --> 00:33:42,634
there was no Akiko.

308
00:33:43,666 --> 00:33:44,933
Only that woman.

309
00:33:46,199 --> 00:33:48,935
She's the same woman that brought you.

310
00:33:50,632 --> 00:33:52,367
Then l woke up here.

311
00:33:52,432 --> 00:33:54,100
How long has it been?

312
00:33:56,232 --> 00:33:58,233
A month. Six weeks maybe.

313
00:33:59,332 --> 00:34:01,934
When you never see the sun rise or set,
how do you know?

314
00:34:04,299 --> 00:34:06,234
Why'd they choose you?

315
00:34:07,933 --> 00:34:10,335
Because l trained with weapons all my life.

316
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:12,867
Have you fought?

317
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:15,466
Yeah.

318
00:34:16,966 --> 00:34:18,033
lt was either him or me.

319
00:34:20,366 --> 00:34:22,167
We're all already dead anyway.

320
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:30,968
l brought you something to eat.

321
00:34:33,065 --> 00:34:34,299
Why?

322
00:34:35,299 --> 00:34:36,667
lt's simple.

323
00:34:54,799 --> 00:34:56,333
Satisfied?

324
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:07,335
You were lucky. You won't be next time.

325
00:35:08,332 --> 00:35:09,833
Why do you care?

326
00:35:10,699 --> 00:35:13,168
-l can help you.
-l don't need your help.

327
00:35:13,232 --> 00:35:15,200
Without me, you'd be dead very soon.

328
00:35:15,899 --> 00:35:17,233
What's in it for you, huh?

329
00:35:17,366 --> 00:35:18,967
l recruited you.

330
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:22,067
You win, l win.

331
00:36:35,499 --> 00:36:39,135
l know it must be maddening for you,
but your situation is hopeless.

332
00:36:39,466 --> 00:36:40,834
Can't escape.

333
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:42,634
You can only hope to survive.

334
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:45,266
Who the hell are you?

335
00:36:46,332 --> 00:36:49,635
l am that man behind the curtain.

336
00:36:50,432 --> 00:36:51,766
You're sick.

337
00:36:53,766 --> 00:36:57,102
When l was growing up,
my father used to stage these brutal,

338
00:36:57,165 --> 00:36:59,400
bare-knuckle fights in the backyard.

339
00:36:59,499 --> 00:37:02,401
All these assholes would come over
and drink and gamble

340
00:37:02,466 --> 00:37:04,734
and cheer the winners and spit on the losers.

341
00:37:05,532 --> 00:37:08,201
Well, in my mind,

342
00:37:08,265 --> 00:37:11,267
iust watching those poor fools lose
wasn't enough.

343
00:37:11,799 --> 00:37:15,369
So l've upped the ante, as it were.

344
00:37:16,933 --> 00:37:19,068
l'm gonna kill you. You know that?

345
00:37:21,332 --> 00:37:27,304
What we have here is
a failure to communicate.

346
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:34,802
l have always wanted to say that!

347
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:38,434
l love Strother Martin.

348
00:37:41,499 --> 00:37:44,335
Where were we?

349
00:37:45,532 --> 00:37:47,300
Yes.

350
00:37:47,466 --> 00:37:49,134
The paradox.

351
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:52,568
You won't fight,

352
00:37:52,632 --> 00:37:54,333
but you don't want to die.

353
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,400
But you will die,

354
00:37:57,766 --> 00:37:59,467
if you won't fight.

355
00:38:01,032 --> 00:38:02,566
You see our dilemma?

356
00:38:03,065 --> 00:38:05,934
l won't fight. Not for you.

357
00:38:06,132 --> 00:38:08,901
Well, who would you fight for? Your wife?

358
00:38:09,632 --> 00:38:12,534
That's right. She's dead.

359
00:38:13,899 --> 00:38:16,935
Well, what would you fight for?

360
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,334
Your freedom?

361
00:38:22,232 --> 00:38:25,635
No, no, seriously.
l'll make you a proposition.

362
00:38:27,232 --> 00:38:31,202
You give me, say, 10 fights.

363
00:38:31,432 --> 00:38:33,834
-One down, nine to go.
-l didn't kill that man.

364
00:38:33,899 --> 00:38:36,434
Horribly mutilated and left for dead?

365
00:38:36,499 --> 00:38:39,768
Knowing he was going to be killed, huh?
Shades of gray, David.

366
00:38:39,866 --> 00:38:41,500
Shades of gray.

367
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,334
You give me an all-out effort,

368
00:38:44,399 --> 00:38:46,934
nine more times and win,

369
00:38:47,733 --> 00:38:48,867
and l'll let you go.

370
00:38:52,232 --> 00:38:54,968
l'm witness to kidnapping, torture
and murder.

371
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:56,533
l know your faces.

372
00:38:56,632 --> 00:38:59,368
You really want me to believe
you'll just let me go?

373
00:39:00,432 --> 00:39:04,502
Well, you'll be drugged and dropped on
some desolate road in a Third World country,

374
00:39:04,566 --> 00:39:06,968
yeah, but you'll be free.

375
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,736
And as far as you knowing who we are,

376
00:39:13,332 --> 00:39:14,933
you don't know shit.

377
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,839
Look, the FBl, Ml5, Interpol,
all kinds of motherfuckers are looking for us.

378
00:39:21,566 --> 00:39:23,601
l don't fear a fireman from Denver.

379
00:39:26,432 --> 00:39:27,900
l give you my word.

380
00:39:29,232 --> 00:39:32,768
Give me nine more fights and win,

381
00:39:32,833 --> 00:39:35,669
and, in the words of Abraham Lincoln,

382
00:39:35,733 --> 00:39:37,768
''l'll set you free!''

383
00:39:39,766 --> 00:39:43,269
Fuck you! l'll die before l kill for you.

384
00:39:44,566 --> 00:39:49,337
l am sorely disappointed. Crushed, really.

385
00:39:50,899 --> 00:39:52,767
But l haven't lost my appetite.

386
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:17,100
What is your name?

387
00:40:18,966 --> 00:40:21,134
You expecting a different answer?

388
00:40:30,165 --> 00:40:31,499
Death Dealer.

389
00:40:32,766 --> 00:40:34,834
How lovely it would be.

390
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:37,567
But first,

391
00:40:38,366 --> 00:40:40,234
you must fight for me.

392
00:40:41,499 --> 00:40:42,967
Or what?

393
00:40:43,499 --> 00:40:45,300
You gonna kill me?

394
00:40:45,366 --> 00:40:50,471
No. l'm gonna kill her.

395
00:40:51,299 --> 00:40:54,301
Your friend's wife. Akiko.

396
00:40:56,632 --> 00:40:58,233
You have three minutes

397
00:40:59,032 --> 00:41:01,434
to kill your opponent.

398
00:41:01,966 --> 00:41:04,835
And by kill, l mean...

399
00:41:06,499 --> 00:41:08,434
Off with his head.

400
00:41:09,532 --> 00:41:13,035
You do that in the allotted amount oftime,

401
00:41:15,399 --> 00:41:17,334
she goes free.

402
00:41:18,366 --> 00:41:20,968
But you lose,

403
00:41:21,632 --> 00:41:26,603
or you're one second over three minutes,

404
00:41:29,432 --> 00:41:31,333
l will slice her throat,

405
00:41:31,966 --> 00:41:35,002
and bleed her like a little fucking piggy.

406
00:41:38,132 --> 00:41:40,667
You know, they say

407
00:41:41,566 --> 00:41:45,069
you drown in your own blood.

408
00:41:46,499 --> 00:41:49,401
Sounds like a horrible way to go.

409
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,669
l'll take it that you accept my offer.

410
00:42:25,032 --> 00:42:26,433
Hey, dude, come here.

411
00:42:27,299 --> 00:42:29,968
You're retarded. Come on. Line up's up.

412
00:42:31,032 --> 00:42:33,234
-''White Samurai''?
-Yeah.

413
00:42:33,299 --> 00:42:35,134
He's only fought once. He's kind of a pussy.

414
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:36,400
You're kind of a pussy.

415
00:42:36,466 --> 00:42:38,301
-l like the Dealer of Death.
-Death Dealer.

416
00:42:38,366 --> 00:42:39,867
-Whatever.
-No, not whatever.

417
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:41,801
His name is Death Dealer,
that's what you should call him.

418
00:42:41,866 --> 00:42:43,267
Shut up, okay?

419
00:42:46,632 --> 00:42:49,201
Oh, my gosh, a damsel in distress.

420
00:42:50,132 --> 00:42:52,300
-Classic.
-l love samurais.

421
00:42:52,366 --> 00:42:53,400
Who doesn't?

422
00:42:53,899 --> 00:42:54,966
Bring up the music.

423
00:42:55,799 --> 00:42:59,435
Gently. Gently.

424
00:43:00,666 --> 00:43:02,467
Now give me a breeze.

425
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:29,134
Lovely!

426
00:43:29,499 --> 00:43:30,766
Ninias don't like samurais.

427
00:43:30,833 --> 00:43:33,368
That's not true.
Ninjas and samurais are like cousins.

428
00:44:12,032 --> 00:44:13,400
-Yeah.
-Yeah!

429
00:44:13,466 --> 00:44:15,634
-That is disgusting.
-l love it when they get gruesome.

430
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:39,600
-Do you think he's gonna make it?
-Yeah.

431
00:44:39,666 --> 00:44:40,933
-No, he's done. He's done.
-No, he's hurt.

432
00:44:55,265 --> 00:44:57,166
-What?
-Awesome!

433
00:45:06,432 --> 00:45:08,767
-David.
-Taiga. Taiga.

434
00:45:09,065 --> 00:45:12,301
Taiga, no, no, no.

435
00:45:14,199 --> 00:45:16,301
They told me they would kill her.

436
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:18,767
l'm sorry.

437
00:45:20,299 --> 00:45:21,967
-Safe.
-That was insane.

438
00:45:22,632 --> 00:45:24,100
l'm sorry.

439
00:45:25,632 --> 00:45:28,634
The Whíte Samuraí fought wíth bravery.

440
00:45:28,699 --> 00:45:31,401
But was unable to defeat hís opponent.

441
00:45:32,666 --> 00:45:36,536
And unable to save hís príncess.

442
00:45:58,265 --> 00:45:59,733
That was a little gross.

443
00:46:10,666 --> 00:46:12,267
l'm sorry.

444
00:46:13,933 --> 00:46:15,301
There's nothing l can do.

445
00:46:21,499 --> 00:46:23,968
Why are you letting this man suffer?

446
00:46:24,032 --> 00:46:26,100
End it. Kill him.

447
00:46:26,666 --> 00:46:29,835
Kill him now.

448
00:46:46,466 --> 00:46:47,967
Awesome!

449
00:47:00,132 --> 00:47:01,166
Fade music.

450
00:47:03,466 --> 00:47:04,900
Fade graphics.

451
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,904
And we're out.

452
00:47:13,232 --> 00:47:16,401
That was astounding!

453
00:47:17,399 --> 00:47:19,868
Kudos to us all.

454
00:47:20,666 --> 00:47:25,070
You said he would fight, Milla,
and fight he did.

455
00:47:26,265 --> 00:47:27,799
My money, please.

456
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,604
Ladies, will you please wire Milla's winnings.

457
00:47:41,566 --> 00:47:43,067
Kawaii.

458
00:47:51,966 --> 00:47:54,234
A little something extra.

459
00:47:55,099 --> 00:47:56,900
You've done exceedingly well, Milla.

460
00:47:57,699 --> 00:48:01,169
Your fireman from Denver
may turn out to be a rainmaker.

461
00:48:03,866 --> 00:48:05,133
Hey.

462
00:48:06,432 --> 00:48:07,666
You.

463
00:48:08,933 --> 00:48:10,734
The one behind the curtain.

464
00:48:12,199 --> 00:48:13,533
Yes.

465
00:48:13,799 --> 00:48:15,400
l accept your offer.

466
00:48:16,199 --> 00:48:19,936
l will give my absolute best
for another eight fights.

467
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,568
On one condition.

468
00:48:23,632 --> 00:48:25,266
And that is?

469
00:48:25,933 --> 00:48:27,768
The last fíght,

470
00:48:29,766 --> 00:48:31,000
l want him.

471
00:48:33,833 --> 00:48:35,301
Those are my terms.

472
00:48:36,366 --> 00:48:38,101
You don't líke them,

473
00:48:38,933 --> 00:48:40,301
then we're done with this bullshit right now.

474
00:48:47,833 --> 00:48:51,836
You are not going to kill yourself.
You're bluffing.

475
00:48:52,733 --> 00:48:54,634
You don't think l could beat him.

476
00:48:56,265 --> 00:48:58,834
Please, it's a nonissue.

477
00:48:58,899 --> 00:49:03,203
No one's ever survived five contests,
Iet alone 10.

478
00:49:06,532 --> 00:49:08,333
People want to see me fight.

479
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,501
l want to fight.

480
00:49:12,132 --> 00:49:13,166
Well?

481
00:49:13,933 --> 00:49:15,567
What's it gonna be?

482
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,035
That's up to you, Kaden.

483
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,801
And what if he wins?

484
00:49:23,799 --> 00:49:27,369
You know l'd never allow that to happen.

485
00:49:30,065 --> 00:49:32,133
We accept your offer,

486
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:34,367
Death Dealer.

487
00:50:00,432 --> 00:50:02,066
They're moving you into another room.

488
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,768
l'd rather have antibiotics.

489
00:50:06,399 --> 00:50:08,267
l can get you those.

490
00:50:08,332 --> 00:50:09,933
What changed?

491
00:50:12,265 --> 00:50:14,166
You fought.

492
00:50:14,232 --> 00:50:15,833
You mean, l won.

493
00:50:17,699 --> 00:50:21,302
So what? Now l'm your prize pig?

494
00:50:23,432 --> 00:50:25,167
How much is your cut

495
00:50:25,766 --> 00:50:28,935
of the death of another innocent life, huh?

496
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:32,334
Do you want the antibiotics or not?

497
00:50:33,265 --> 00:50:35,467
Yeah, l want the antibiotics.

498
00:50:39,065 --> 00:50:41,400
And something to sew it up!

499
00:51:14,265 --> 00:51:16,300
Watch the muscle, watch the muscle.

500
00:51:16,666 --> 00:51:18,534
Right there.

501
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,334
Wider stitches, okay?

502
00:51:33,499 --> 00:51:36,168
Very good. Pull the skin.

503
00:51:36,332 --> 00:51:39,368
Pull the skin. Pull it tight.

504
00:52:05,799 --> 00:52:07,400
Fuck.

505
00:52:14,299 --> 00:52:15,700
Yeah, yeah.

506
00:52:43,733 --> 00:52:45,634
Looks like you're getting better.

507
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,568
Better enough to fight.

508
00:52:51,566 --> 00:52:53,000
Exactly.

509
00:53:04,899 --> 00:53:05,966
Thank you.

510
00:53:09,065 --> 00:53:10,366
Really.

511
00:55:21,666 --> 00:55:25,636
Yeah, we sure do like a whipping.
But nothing

512
00:55:26,866 --> 00:55:28,601
like a pussy-whipping.

513
00:57:52,099 --> 00:57:53,800
Hey, check this out.

514
00:57:53,866 --> 00:57:55,500
What's up?

515
00:57:55,566 --> 00:57:57,734
-Dude.
-Yeah.

516
00:57:57,799 --> 00:58:00,301
Hell, yeah, Death Dealer will be all over him.

517
00:58:00,399 --> 00:58:02,100
-You think so?
-Definitely.

518
00:58:02,165 --> 00:58:04,433
-He's gonna kill him.
-The Executioner's a big guy.

519
00:59:04,466 --> 00:59:06,267
What'd you do to your hair?

520
00:59:07,399 --> 00:59:10,702
Just trying something a little different.

521
01:01:17,432 --> 01:01:19,200
l am Davíd Lord.

522
01:01:19,466 --> 01:01:22,535
Yeah! Yeah!

523
01:01:25,866 --> 01:01:27,968
Oh, my goodness!

524
01:01:28,032 --> 01:01:32,536
He is every bit as good
as you were in your prime.

525
01:01:33,966 --> 01:01:37,969
You know, iust say the word, partner.

526
01:01:38,032 --> 01:01:39,733
We can call this off.

527
01:02:33,165 --> 01:02:37,335
My name is David Lord.
And in one more fight, l'm gonna kill you.

528
01:02:47,532 --> 01:02:50,835
That was amazing, my man.

529
01:02:51,499 --> 01:02:54,935
Bravo! Bravo!

530
01:03:02,032 --> 01:03:03,266
Better watch your back.

531
01:03:04,833 --> 01:03:07,468
He may have found himself a new favorite.

532
01:03:45,833 --> 01:03:47,801
We've got a situation up here.

533
01:04:34,632 --> 01:04:38,035
Brutus Jackson,
who terrorized South Africa 1 2 months ago

534
01:04:38,099 --> 01:04:41,602
by going on a drug-induced rampage,
killing 14 people, has escaped.

535
01:04:43,132 --> 01:04:46,869
Jackson was beíng transferred
to the death row facílíty at Pollsmoor

536
01:04:46,933 --> 01:04:50,036
when the transport carryíng hím
was brazenly ambushed

537
01:04:50,132 --> 01:04:52,400
íust outsíde the Robben Island Príson gate.

538
01:04:53,032 --> 01:04:57,002
The three guards escortíng Jackson
were found dead at the scene.

539
01:04:57,065 --> 01:04:59,500
Local authorítíes have
no further ínformatíon at thís tíme.

540
01:05:01,933 --> 01:05:05,069
Are you out of your fucking mind?

541
01:05:06,265 --> 01:05:07,432
l don't see the problem.

542
01:05:07,899 --> 01:05:11,936
The whole universe is looking for us
and you pull a stunt like this!

543
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,736
You kidnap a world-famous serial killer?

544
01:05:14,933 --> 01:05:16,000
Spree killer.

545
01:05:17,566 --> 01:05:19,234
You might as well
drop a trail of bread crumbs

546
01:05:19,299 --> 01:05:21,000
leading law enforcement to our door!

547
01:05:21,065 --> 01:05:24,568
Come on. The deadbeats are boring.

548
01:05:24,632 --> 01:05:27,601
All the mind fucking in the world
can't help someone who's physically weak.

549
01:05:28,833 --> 01:05:32,336
Listen, and this guy,

550
01:05:32,399 --> 01:05:33,900
he is a monster.

551
01:05:34,132 --> 01:05:35,867
He is ready to kill again.

552
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:41,136
Think of the added revenue
when our audience sees that it's him.

553
01:05:41,566 --> 01:05:45,736
No longer will anyone be able to claim
that our fights aren't real.

554
01:05:48,199 --> 01:05:50,067
You're afraid of him.

555
01:05:52,432 --> 01:05:56,335
Yeah, and you will be, too,
once you get up close and personal.

556
01:05:56,399 --> 01:05:59,068
No, no, no, no. Not the serial killer.

557
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:03,300
You're afraid of the fireman.

558
01:06:05,432 --> 01:06:09,335
You are hurting me!

559
01:06:26,933 --> 01:06:28,167
What?

560
01:06:29,766 --> 01:06:32,135
How did you come to be their hostage?

561
01:06:33,699 --> 01:06:35,233
That's funny.

562
01:06:36,532 --> 01:06:39,501
Let's iust say
my family wasn't as pleasant as they are.

563
01:06:41,699 --> 01:06:44,301
Certainly with less reward.

564
01:06:49,065 --> 01:06:51,133
Kaden's afraid of you.

565
01:06:52,499 --> 01:06:54,434
He brought in some professional,

566
01:06:55,165 --> 01:06:57,767
some maniac from South Africa.

567
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,203
Come back alive. Please.

568
01:07:13,299 --> 01:07:16,635
Just two more
and at least one of us will be free.

569
01:07:19,866 --> 01:07:21,334
You know they won't let me live.

570
01:07:27,566 --> 01:07:29,267
l have a brother, Sam.

571
01:07:31,332 --> 01:07:33,300
We haven't spoken since the accident.

572
01:07:35,666 --> 01:07:38,402
l tuned out everyone l ever loved.

573
01:07:38,466 --> 01:07:41,302
He probably doesn't even know l'm missing.

574
01:07:41,866 --> 01:07:43,901
Or that l'll soon be dead.

575
01:07:44,966 --> 01:07:46,500
Wish l had been a better brother.

576
01:07:49,499 --> 01:07:51,634
Now l want closure, you know?

577
01:08:38,599 --> 01:08:40,167
So have you guys done that whole,
you know,

578
01:08:40,232 --> 01:08:41,900
-college threesome thing yet or...
-Dude.

579
01:08:42,099 --> 01:08:44,267
You're never gonna believe
who Death Dealer is fighting.

580
01:08:44,466 --> 01:08:46,401
Remember that South African
serial killer guy?

581
01:08:46,466 --> 01:08:47,466
-Yeah.
-The one who escaped?

582
01:08:47,566 --> 01:08:49,234
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Him.

583
01:08:49,432 --> 01:08:51,000
-Tonight?
-Now.

584
01:08:51,065 --> 01:08:53,233
lt was nice meeting you guys. Have fun.

585
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,035
Death Dealer! Death Dealer!

586
01:09:02,165 --> 01:09:03,633
-Oh, my God.
-Sacagawea!

587
01:09:08,899 --> 01:09:10,100
-Kill the man!
-Yeah!

588
01:09:18,699 --> 01:09:20,067
God damn!

589
01:09:22,833 --> 01:09:24,434
Where'd he go?

590
01:09:25,432 --> 01:09:27,700
Kaneko, Kawaii, can one of you find him?

591
01:09:33,232 --> 01:09:37,002
Having a little bit of fun now,
aren't we? Yeah?

592
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,735
Well, you ain't seen nothing yet.

593
01:09:50,532 --> 01:09:53,735
-Yes! All day long, yeah!
-God, this is so awesome!

594
01:09:58,766 --> 01:10:00,834
Yeah! Yeah!

595
01:10:05,466 --> 01:10:07,467
Got a lot of fight in ya.

596
01:10:08,866 --> 01:10:11,501
lt's pointless, although it's noble.

597
01:10:22,199 --> 01:10:24,668
That's nice. Very nice.

598
01:10:26,899 --> 01:10:28,600
Very, very nice.

599
01:11:00,199 --> 01:11:01,667
Payback's a bitch, huh?

600
01:11:12,566 --> 01:11:14,701
lt's been nice knowing you.

601
01:11:37,733 --> 01:11:39,801
-Yeah!
-Oh, my God!

602
01:11:39,866 --> 01:11:41,667
That was frickin' awesome.

603
01:13:06,899 --> 01:13:08,400
Fade music.

604
01:13:10,265 --> 01:13:11,633
Titles.

605
01:13:13,833 --> 01:13:13,833
And we are out.

606
01:13:38,132 --> 01:13:39,399

-He iust owned that, you know?

623
01:15:40,766 --> 01:15:43,935
Well, well, well, the Wizard himself.

624
01:15:44,766 --> 01:15:47,268
To what do l owe
the extreme pleasure ofthis surprise visit?

625
01:15:47,833 --> 01:15:50,235
Well, fireman, you got your wish.

626
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,635
Any thoughts to what you're gonna do
when you're free?

627
01:15:56,399 --> 01:15:57,633
So how's it gonna come?

628
01:15:58,265 --> 01:16:00,100
How's what gonna come?

629
01:16:03,165 --> 01:16:05,433
All right, okay, so you know.

630
01:16:06,199 --> 01:16:09,201
Here l had this speech prepared
l was gonna give, but...

631
01:16:16,833 --> 01:16:18,534
l had the lab whip this up.

632
01:16:19,032 --> 01:16:20,933
Genius little concoction.

633
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:22,700
Takes about 20 minutes to kick in.

634
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,334
lt won't kill you.

635
01:16:24,632 --> 01:16:27,568
Just throw you off your game. Teeny bit.

636
01:16:28,733 --> 01:16:31,368
Can't have our fans feeling like
they got ripped off, now can we?

637
01:16:31,799 --> 01:16:33,600
They've come to expect
great things from you.

638
01:16:33,666 --> 01:16:37,369
You and Kaden, you're both iust cowards.

639
01:16:38,699 --> 01:16:41,535
No. No, only me.

640
01:16:42,332 --> 01:16:45,334
Kaden may be a lot ofthings,
but he's not a coward.

641
01:16:47,866 --> 01:16:50,401
You are really great in there.

642
01:16:50,466 --> 01:16:53,101
lt's like you were born to do this.

643
01:16:54,499 --> 01:16:56,667
You know, there is another way.

644
01:16:57,766 --> 01:17:01,436
You could stay and achieve true greatness.

645
01:17:01,933 --> 01:17:04,068

648
01:17:26,833 --> 01:17:28,768
After l'm done with Kaden.

649
01:17:34,799 --> 01:17:36,600
Good luck with that.

650
01:17:52,299 --> 01:17:54,768
Your boyfriend dies tonight.

651
01:18:15,766 --> 01:18:17,134
-So gonna whup his ass.
-Here we go, here we go.

652

653
01:19:08,666 --> 01:19:10,200
Come on, Kaden.

654
01:19:28,699 --> 01:19:29,733
Come on.

01:20:46,499 --> 01:20:49,368
l don't know how it happened,
but your cover was blown.

658
01:20:51,833 --> 01:20:54,402
Probably a retaliation
for the Korean sanction.

659
01:21:00,833 --> 01:21:02,234
Hi, l'm looking for Sam Lord.

660
01:21:04,366 --> 01:21:05,867
Who's calling?

661
01:21:05,933 --> 01:21:09,436
l have a message for you
from your brother, Davíd.

662
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:14,636
From my brother David? David Lord?

663
01:21:16,632 --> 01:21:19,401
Ready the men.
We have a location on Agent Searle.

664
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:23,466
Come on.

665
01:21:24,866 --> 01:21:26,000
Come here, you.

666
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,803
You ready to die, Death Dealer, huh?
Ready to die?

667
01:21:37,866 --> 01:21:40,802
They've got a website. Death Games.

668
01:21:41,766 --> 01:21:42,833
Real fucked up shit.

669
01:21:43,265 --> 01:21:46,635
But they're no two-bit operation.
Their online security is flawless.

670
01:21:46,699 --> 01:21:49,401
So their origins are unknown
and so far untraceable.

671
01:21:49,466 --> 01:21:51,401
So is the money trail.

672
01:21:52,065 --> 01:21:53,099
Dead end every time.

673
01:21:58,165 --> 01:22:02,135
l'd be lying if l didn't tell you that this is the
closest thing there is to a suicide mission.

674
01:22:02,733 --> 01:22:04,768
-Are you sure?
-l want this assignment.

675
01:22:06,099 --> 01:22:07,633
Give it!

676
01:22:25,699 --> 01:22:26,766
Kill him.

677
01:22:42,733 --> 01:22:44,734
That's quality action right there.

678
01:22:52,599 --> 01:22:55,301
-Who are you?
-My name is David Lord.

679
01:22:55,366 --> 01:22:57,534
David Lord. David Lord.

680
01:22:57,599 --> 01:22:59,233
Your cover name will be David Lord.

681
01:22:59,599 --> 01:23:02,234
You're a firefighter and a paramedic
from Denver, Colorado.

682
01:23:02,299 --> 01:23:04,067
My name is Death Dealer.

683
01:23:04,366 --> 01:23:07,135
-No.
-l was bred to fight. To kill.

684
01:23:07,566 --> 01:23:08,733
l made you.

685
01:23:09,165 --> 01:23:10,466
And l will end you!

686
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:12,300
No.

687
01:23:23,733 --> 01:23:28,471
Why and how in the fuck is he still standing?

688
01:23:30,265 --> 01:23:31,432
Can you help me?

689
01:23:52,699 --> 01:23:54,534
Why are you smiling, you conniving bitch?

690
01:23:54,699 --> 01:23:56,200
-Do you realize what you...
-Logan!

691
01:24:10,432 --> 01:24:12,300
You know what to do.

692
01:24:46,933 --> 01:24:49,602
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!

693
01:25:15,733 --> 01:25:18,302
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!

694
01:26:02,699 --> 01:26:04,033
Going somewhere?

695
01:26:18,599 --> 01:26:22,369
l could have killed you months ago!
l protected you!

696
01:26:25,332 --> 01:26:27,734
Somehow l don't feel protected.

697
01:26:27,933 --> 01:26:32,504
Look, l can give you more money
than you could ever spend!

698
01:26:32,566 --> 01:26:33,800
l'm sure you could.

699
01:26:33,866 --> 01:26:35,867
Here, take it!

700
01:26:41,966 --> 01:26:44,301
On the ground, on the ground,
get on the ground!

701
01:26:50,132 --> 01:26:51,566
Room's clear.

702
01:26:53,566 --> 01:26:57,303
l never murdered anyone!
It was Kaden, he's the one!

703
01:26:57,366 --> 01:26:59,201
And your hands are clean?

704
01:26:59,265 --> 01:27:00,933
Cleaner than yours!

705
01:27:01,466 --> 01:27:04,735
You can't make somebody change, David!

706
01:27:04,799 --> 01:27:07,701
You murdered those people
because you wanted to do it!

707
01:27:07,966 --> 01:27:12,970
All that bullshit about brainwashing!
You didn't have to do it! You wanted to do it!

708
01:27:13,032 --> 01:27:16,668
lt's who you are,
it's who you've always been!

709
01:27:16,733 --> 01:27:19,102
We're the same, you're iust like me!

710
01:27:19,165 --> 01:27:20,299
So tell me,

711
01:27:20,432 --> 01:27:23,735
since we're the same, what am l about to do?

712
01:27:36,966 --> 01:27:40,302
No! No! No!

713
01:28:00,332 --> 01:28:02,901
Drop your weapon and get on your knees!
Drop your weapon!

714
01:28:03,432 --> 01:28:05,200
Drop your weapon!

715
01:28:06,833 --> 01:28:07,967
Agent Searle?

716
01:28:12,966 --> 01:28:15,101
Agent Searle?

717
01:28:16,305 --> 01:28:22,785
