Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese

2
00:01:38,274 --> 00:01:41,024
To the Bank of England! Quickly!

3
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,584
Surround the building!

4
00:01:42,712 --> 00:01:45,265
You go that way! You go this way!

5
00:01:53,088 --> 00:01:55,455
There he is!

6
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,512
- Come on!
- After him, men!

7
00:02:24,988 --> 00:02:25,970
That way!

8
00:02:49,645 --> 00:02:53,060
- He came this way. I'm sure of it.
- Come on!

9
00:02:53,282 --> 00:02:55,551
Come on, mates! Keep up!

10
00:03:00,423 --> 00:03:02,278
Sorry, sir.

11
00:03:23,747 --> 00:03:27,838
Today is the day I will finally achieve
what has been deemed impossible.

12
00:03:28,585 --> 00:03:31,901
Man can break
the 50-mile-per-hour speed barrier.

13
00:03:32,688 --> 00:03:35,437
And you're lucky
to be a part of it, Pierre.

14
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,959
- It's Jean Michel, sir.
- Yes.

15
00:03:38,128 --> 00:03:41,641
We will make history.
Or we will die trying.

16
00:03:42,865 --> 00:03:45,102
- Die?
- This is very exciting.

17
00:03:45,268 --> 00:03:48,464
That's it!
I refuse to be catapulted,

18
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:52,730
electrocuted, or have my internal organs
disrupted any longer!

19
00:03:54,544 --> 00:03:56,518
I quit!

20
00:03:59,482 --> 00:04:01,392
He is a very sick man!

21
00:04:03,986 --> 00:04:06,888
The electrocution was not my fault!

22
00:04:07,123 --> 00:04:10,189
You refused to wear
the rubber underpants!

23
00:04:10,426 --> 00:04:12,336
We're looking for a bank robber.

24
00:04:15,264 --> 00:04:17,533
Is there no man brave enough
to be my valet?

25
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,839
Oh... Aah!

26
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:25,148
I'm your new valet.

27
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:29,007
Uh... I must commend
the valet service

28
00:04:29,213 --> 00:04:31,417
on their impeccable foresight.

29
00:04:31,582 --> 00:04:34,680
But they know I only
accept French valets.

30
00:04:34,884 --> 00:04:37,786
Yes. Oh! Oui! Oui!

31
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,500
I come from a long line
of French valets.

32
00:04:41,757 --> 00:04:44,277
On my father's side.
Very, very French.

33
00:04:45,094 --> 00:04:48,804
- But your accent.
- My father French. Never speak.

34
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:53,886
My mother Chinese and never shuts up.
All the children pick up her accent.

35
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:57,362
Very well.

36
00:04:57,507 --> 00:05:01,435
Will you be willing to risk your life
to challenge the laws of physics?

37
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:05,987
- Yes. Uh, and I can sing, too.
- Excellent. Pop this little hat on.

38
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,184
- He's got to be in here.
- He's this way!

39
00:05:14,457 --> 00:05:17,654
And the throttle in your
right hand controls the speed.

40
00:05:22,832 --> 00:05:26,181
- How do I stop?
- Godspeed!

41
00:05:44,487 --> 00:05:45,502
Uh-uh-uh...

42
00:05:47,357 --> 00:05:50,902
Twenty-five miles per hour.
Yes, the pressure's stable-ish.

43
00:05:51,594 --> 00:05:55,107
We need more speed, man.

44
00:05:55,332 --> 00:05:57,667
Waah! Wee-yoo!

45
00:05:58,267 --> 00:06:01,049
Forty miles per hour.
Hang on in there, my good man.

46
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:08,847
Forty-seven.

47
00:06:09,012 --> 00:06:10,506
Forty-eight.

48
00:06:10,646 --> 00:06:12,369
Forty-nine.

49
00:06:12,515 --> 00:06:14,403
Eureka! We've done it!

50
00:06:23,026 --> 00:06:24,368
Uh...

51
00:06:25,462 --> 00:06:26,444
Waaah!

52
00:06:26,562 --> 00:06:28,951
I say, I say. Uh, good morning.

53
00:06:29,132 --> 00:06:32,744
- I'm looking for a man with...
- Over here!

54
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,693
There he is. There's my valet.

55
00:06:38,007 --> 00:06:40,244
Sorry! New valet.

56
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,856
Whoa!

57
00:06:53,022 --> 00:06:55,772
Whoa!

58
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:00,094
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

59
00:07:00,262 --> 00:07:04,004
You'll be able to let go any second.

60
00:07:04,234 --> 00:07:05,728
The pack will run out of steam

61
00:07:05,868 --> 00:07:10,123
in exactly three, two, one.

62
00:07:10,373 --> 00:07:12,064
Now.

63
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,380
Look out!

64
00:07:17,046 --> 00:07:20,429
- That was incredible!
- We've broken the human speed barrier.

65
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,519
Good-bye, sir.

66
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,567
It's been very nice valeting for you.

67
00:07:28,058 --> 00:07:31,353
Let's... do it again soon.

68
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,869
Please, wait!

69
00:07:32,996 --> 00:07:35,931
With you as my brave valet,
I can test all my inventions.

70
00:07:37,133 --> 00:07:38,181
No!

71
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:40,155
Spread out!

72
00:07:40,303 --> 00:07:41,579
- Cover that...
- Yes, yes.

73
00:07:41,704 --> 00:07:44,421
- I take the job.
- Splendid!

74
00:07:44,607 --> 00:07:46,844
I can't wait to present
my results to the Academy.

75
00:07:49,078 --> 00:07:52,177
Too kind. Too kind. Thank you.

76
00:07:52,382 --> 00:07:56,888
And with this grant to develop
new applications for copper wire,

77
00:07:57,187 --> 00:08:00,351
Dr. Ramsey invented this.

78
00:08:04,394 --> 00:08:06,947
Needless to say,
the Royal Academy of Science

79
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:10,872
declared this crackpot
mentally incompetent,

80
00:08:11,133 --> 00:08:15,126
and he was duly dispatched
to a lunatic asylum.

81
00:08:17,507 --> 00:08:20,224
Sir. I have an urgent
announcement for you. Here.

82
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:22,962
Don't just stand there. Read it.

83
00:08:23,145 --> 00:08:25,087
Oh. Um...

84
00:08:25,248 --> 00:08:28,728
"It is with great distress

85
00:08:28,951 --> 00:08:31,537
that Scotland Yard announces

86
00:08:31,754 --> 00:08:34,372
that the Bank of England...
has been robbed."

87
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:39,605
My stolen Jade Buddha stolen?
You blighter!

88
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:43,310
You gave me every assurance that
the Bank of England was impenetrable!

89
00:08:43,532 --> 00:08:46,019
Sir, sir, I said, "lmpregnable."

90
00:08:46,201 --> 00:08:48,885
It's the same thing, you idiot!

91
00:08:50,706 --> 00:08:53,127
Please, please, not the quills!

92
00:08:53,309 --> 00:08:55,164
Lord Salisbury!

93
00:08:55,311 --> 00:08:59,141
Please contact General Fang
and inform her, no Buddha, no deal.

94
00:08:59,381 --> 00:09:03,090
To forgo your obligation would
be dishonorable, Lord Kelvin.

95
00:09:04,286 --> 00:09:06,773
A woman in the Royal Academy?

96
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,535
The Jade Buddha was delivered
by us to the Bank of England.

97
00:09:10,793 --> 00:09:14,819
- What happens while in British hands...
- Is absolutely your concern.

98
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:18,379
Colonel Kitchner,
chief of Scotland Yard,

99
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:19,910
please inform General Fang

100
00:09:20,036 --> 00:09:22,523
what other items were stolen
from the bank.

101
00:09:22,705 --> 00:09:26,022
Nothing else.

102
00:09:26,242 --> 00:09:29,538
Exactly. It seems
your little land dispute

103
00:09:29,746 --> 00:09:32,746
has spilled over
onto our noble shore.

104
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:35,337
Until the Jade Buddha
is back in my possession,

105
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:40,636
you and your cause will receive no
British military assistance whatsoever.

106
00:09:41,523 --> 00:09:43,182
Kitchner.

107
00:09:45,362 --> 00:09:49,803
My agents will retrieve the Jade
Buddha once again, Lord Kelvin.

108
00:09:50,066 --> 00:09:53,327
This time, do not let it
slip through your fingers.

109
00:10:11,187 --> 00:10:12,976
A female general.

110
00:10:13,123 --> 00:10:16,254
What sort of pathetic man
takes orders from a woman?

111
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,139
Cor!

112
00:10:22,264 --> 00:10:25,908
- Come away from here.
- Oh, Dad. Can't we stay?

113
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,447
My wind-powered pulley system

114
00:10:36,612 --> 00:10:39,034
circulates the house with fresh air.

115
00:10:39,215 --> 00:10:42,085
Kitchen items are to be placed
on the white boat,

116
00:10:42,285 --> 00:10:44,652
and the blue is for laundry.

117
00:10:44,821 --> 00:10:47,090
But most importantly,
this supplies the house

118
00:10:47,256 --> 00:10:50,387
with a running current of electricity.

119
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:53,552
Electricity.

120
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:58,333
This is my comprehensive
data schedule and list of regulations.

121
00:10:58,601 --> 00:11:02,311
It's quite simple. You're never
to divert one iota from my plans.

122
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:04,961
I must live my life
with total efficiency...

123
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,507
to maximize my inventing capacity,

124
00:11:07,677 --> 00:11:11,354
thus enabling me to do
the most I can for mankind.

125
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,857
Uh, Mr. Fogg, you are a noble,
precise gentleman.

126
00:11:16,619 --> 00:11:21,289
Thank you. Uh... Sorry.
What was your name? Ahem.

127
00:11:22,258 --> 00:11:25,554
Passport. Too.

128
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:28,223
Passepartout.

129
00:11:37,206 --> 00:11:39,279
Bottled light.

130
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,935
A miracle.

131
00:11:41,077 --> 00:11:42,483
Hardly.

132
00:11:42,612 --> 00:11:46,889
Just undiscovered science from
an American named Thomas Edison.

133
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,899
It turns on with a whistle.

134
00:11:52,121 --> 00:11:55,187
Please don't do that.

135
00:11:55,392 --> 00:11:57,334
Ah, I see your eye is drawn

136
00:11:57,526 --> 00:12:00,973
to what I hope will one day
be my crowning achievement.

137
00:12:01,195 --> 00:12:02,951
A giant moth?

138
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,667
- It's a flying machine.
- It can fly?

139
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,910
Yes.

140
00:12:10,073 --> 00:12:12,756
No. But it will... one day.

141
00:12:12,942 --> 00:12:15,877
One day it will transport people
through the air.

142
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,894
Perhaps over entire oceans.

143
00:12:21,417 --> 00:12:22,661
Uh-oh.

144
00:12:22,818 --> 00:12:25,720
I'm going to have
to make a rule for this.

145
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:40,158
Dear Father:

146
00:12:40,303 --> 00:12:44,874
I will find the fastest way
back to China...

147
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,475
to make our village safe once again.

148
00:13:03,292 --> 00:13:04,634
Passepartout?

149
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,429
Departure for the Royal Academy
of Science in two minutes.

150
00:13:09,698 --> 00:13:11,007
Prepare my urban transport device.

151
00:13:11,134 --> 00:13:12,989
Prepare my urban transport device.

152
00:13:14,203 --> 00:13:15,796
It's the shoes
with little wheels on them.

153
00:13:15,939 --> 00:13:16,702
It's the shoes
with little wheels on them.

154
00:13:19,976 --> 00:13:21,601
Clear the way. Clear the way.

155
00:13:21,744 --> 00:13:24,046
Mr. Fogg coming through.
Watch out! Watch out!

156
00:13:25,314 --> 00:13:27,256
Excuse me. Out of way.

157
00:13:28,917 --> 00:13:30,608
- Gangway.
- Fogg's arrived.

158
00:13:30,787 --> 00:13:33,056
- Gangway. Ooh!
- Hey!

159
00:13:33,222 --> 00:13:35,939
That makes it exactly
ten minutes before noon.

160
00:13:36,593 --> 00:13:38,055
That will be all.

161
00:13:42,599 --> 00:13:44,388
Gentlemen.

162
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:46,867
Today I have proved that man

163
00:13:47,036 --> 00:13:49,884
can break the 50-mile-per-hour
speed barrier

164
00:13:50,073 --> 00:13:52,440
without disrupting
his internal organs.

165
00:13:53,675 --> 00:13:57,058
Where is your Royal Academy
of Science authorization?

166
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,581
What am I thinking? What a fool.

167
00:13:59,748 --> 00:14:02,748
That would mean that you
were a real scientist!

168
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,338
By your definition,
a real scientist's objective

169
00:14:07,523 --> 00:14:09,694
would be to prevent man from progress.

170
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,732
We live in a golden age, Fogg.

171
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:15,830
Everything worth discovering
has been discovered.

172
00:14:16,031 --> 00:14:18,070
Yet ridiculous dreamers
like you insist

173
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:21,430
on a past filled with dinosaurs...

174
00:14:21,637 --> 00:14:23,099
and evolution.

175
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,342
And on a future filled

176
00:14:25,507 --> 00:14:27,362
with motorized vehicles,

177
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:29,746
radio waves,

178
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:31,767
and flying machines!

179
00:14:31,915 --> 00:14:35,014
Confound it! The bloody
Bank of England is a madhouse!

180
00:14:37,086 --> 00:14:39,901
Rumor has it the bloke's a foreigner.
An Asian chap.

181
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,424
Rumor has it the bloke's a foreigner.

182
00:14:46,963 --> 00:14:48,239
Nothing.

183
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:56,023
Yes, I heard it was a Chinese fellow,
and he acted alone.

184
00:15:02,712 --> 00:15:06,738
No. Actually,
they say he was Norwegian.

185
00:15:10,853 --> 00:15:13,952
In fact, though, it was a gang
of elderly Norwegians.

186
00:15:14,923 --> 00:15:17,312
I heard it from a very reliable source

187
00:15:17,527 --> 00:15:20,341
that it was a gang
of redheaded elderly Norwegians

188
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,871
with very tiny feet.

189
00:15:24,233 --> 00:15:26,721
It's about time
someone robbed that bank.

190
00:15:26,902 --> 00:15:29,040
Like this very institution,

191
00:15:29,204 --> 00:15:31,146
the Bank of England is outdated.

192
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:34,241
As usual, your contempt
for tradition is appalling.

193
00:15:35,577 --> 00:15:38,512
You rest on your traditions,
if you prefer,

194
00:15:38,715 --> 00:15:42,392
but, as with this bank robber,
progress waits for no one.

195
00:15:42,987 --> 00:15:46,020
So now you're an expert
on the bank thief as well.

196
00:15:46,256 --> 00:15:49,485
Give us the benefit
of your ineffable wisdom, Fogg.

197
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,994
Twenty-six minutes ago,
a ship left Dover for Paris.

198
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,753
From there, the thief
takes the Orient Express,

199
00:15:58,936 --> 00:16:02,197
where he transfers to a steamer,
from Istanbul to India.

200
00:16:02,406 --> 00:16:04,827
In little over a month,
that man could be in China.

201
00:16:05,775 --> 00:16:10,248
If we're to believe Fogg's calculations,
he will have circled the globe

202
00:16:10,513 --> 00:16:12,368
and returned to England in a fortnight.

203
00:16:16,954 --> 00:16:22,038
Actually, by my calculations, it would
be closer to, uh, exactly 80 days.

204
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,471
Outstanding idea.

205
00:16:32,635 --> 00:16:34,523
Well, then, Fogg,

206
00:16:34,672 --> 00:16:37,421
let's see you circumnavigate the world

207
00:16:37,608 --> 00:16:39,942
in 80 days.

208
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:44,936
I... That would be
a fruitless use of my time.

209
00:16:45,181 --> 00:16:47,286
I'm on the verge of numerous...

210
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:49,817
countless... scientific breakthroughs.

211
00:16:51,087 --> 00:16:54,121
You coward. Admit it.
It cannot be done.

212
00:16:55,024 --> 00:16:57,774
It can! I could do it.

213
00:16:57,961 --> 00:17:00,197
A wager.

214
00:17:00,364 --> 00:17:03,462
£10,000.

215
00:17:04,234 --> 00:17:07,430
Unlike you and your colleagues,
money does not inspire me.

216
00:17:08,004 --> 00:17:11,615
I believe every man has his price.

217
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,769
Even you, o noble Phileas Fogg.

218
00:17:16,013 --> 00:17:20,453
There must be something I could offer
that would be worthy of your time.

219
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:27,265
There is. Your position as head
of the Royal Academy.

220
00:17:31,227 --> 00:17:33,748
I could lead Britain
and the rest of the world

221
00:17:33,931 --> 00:17:36,451
into a new age of progress
and discovery.

222
00:17:40,069 --> 00:17:41,727
- Fair enough.
- What?

223
00:17:43,741 --> 00:17:47,353
I, Lord Kelvin, hereby vow

224
00:17:47,577 --> 00:17:51,984
to surrender my position as minister
of science to Phileas Fogg...

225
00:17:52,248 --> 00:17:54,256
- No!
- No! No!

226
00:17:54,417 --> 00:17:58,192
if he can circumnavigate
the globe...

227
00:17:58,421 --> 00:18:00,877
in no more than 80 days.

228
00:18:02,725 --> 00:18:04,732
But if he cannot,

229
00:18:04,894 --> 00:18:08,756
he must never set foot
in this academy again,

230
00:18:09,431 --> 00:18:14,614
he must tear down that abhorrent eyesore
he calls a laboratory,

231
00:18:14,904 --> 00:18:17,359
and he must swear...

232
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,475
never to invent again.

233
00:18:24,315 --> 00:18:26,551
Just as I always suspected, Fogg.

234
00:18:26,717 --> 00:18:30,033
You promise so much, yet you deliver...

235
00:18:30,286 --> 00:18:31,780
oh, nothing.

236
00:18:34,923 --> 00:18:37,062
- I'll take your wager.
- What did you say?

237
00:18:39,063 --> 00:18:40,918
I'll take your wager!

238
00:18:42,031 --> 00:18:43,340
He did it.

239
00:18:47,037 --> 00:18:48,761
Then it's done.

240
00:18:48,906 --> 00:18:53,030
A man who has never set foot
out of England circling the globe.

241
00:18:54,912 --> 00:18:57,301
This is going to be rather amusing.

242
00:18:59,682 --> 00:19:03,872
History won't remember your amusement,
but it will be hard-pressed to forget

243
00:19:04,153 --> 00:19:08,593
the moment I'm standing on the very top
step of the Royal Academy of Science.

244
00:19:08,858 --> 00:19:11,793
By the strike of noon,

245
00:19:12,028 --> 00:19:15,639
after I, Phileas Fogg,
have traveled around the world

246
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:18,639
in 80 days!

247
00:19:25,408 --> 00:19:26,749
Oh, dear.

248
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:33,092
Mr. Fogg, we all pack and ready to go.
Mr. Fogg, are you in here?

249
00:19:33,383 --> 00:19:36,449
Phileas! Phileas! Phileas!

250
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,605
- Uh...
- Mr. Fogg, are you well, sir?

251
00:19:40,823 --> 00:19:42,547
Huh?

252
00:19:42,693 --> 00:19:44,547
Uh, Passepartout.

253
00:19:45,728 --> 00:19:48,576
Would you... sit with me a moment?

254
00:19:54,303 --> 00:19:55,350
Yes, sir.

255
00:20:00,778 --> 00:20:04,039
I risked everything,
my entire life's work.

256
00:20:05,481 --> 00:20:08,383
For something you believe in.

257
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:11,486
Nothing could make
more sense than that, sir.

258
00:20:17,026 --> 00:20:18,848
You are honorable, Passepartout.

259
00:20:20,196 --> 00:20:23,644
But I'm afraid this was
a calamitous lapse of judgment.

260
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,695
- Mr. Fogg?
- Yes?

261
00:20:30,472 --> 00:20:33,222
- Let your family...
- There is no one left to tell.

262
00:20:34,745 --> 00:20:37,876
This house and my inventions
are all I have.

263
00:20:42,552 --> 00:20:47,440
And a brave French valet that will help
you make it around the world in 80 days.

264
00:20:52,396 --> 00:20:55,145
- You really believe we can succeed?
- Yes.

265
00:20:55,899 --> 00:20:58,582
Yes. Yes. Yes!

266
00:20:58,768 --> 00:21:01,638
You're mad. We'll be sliced to pieces
before we reach India.

267
00:21:04,707 --> 00:21:06,082
We're with you, sir!

268
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:11,271
Good luck!

269
00:21:16,185 --> 00:21:17,941
Halt!

270
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:24,206
- Quite a contraption here, Mr. Fogg.
- Thank you, Inspector.

271
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:30,024
But I'm afraid I'm gonna have to detain
you and your valet until further notice.

272
00:21:30,334 --> 00:21:34,556
This here doohickey is in violation
of the city's new vehicle code.

273
00:21:35,437 --> 00:21:36,932
Vehicle code?

274
00:21:37,074 --> 00:21:38,764
Code 431.

275
00:21:38,908 --> 00:21:42,837
All vehicles
must be powered by horses.

276
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,756
Or other indigenous
quadruped creatures of the like,

277
00:21:46,984 --> 00:21:48,772
excluding giraffes and...

278
00:21:48,918 --> 00:21:50,445
You're driveling. Stand aside.

279
00:21:50,621 --> 00:21:53,076
I'm about to embark upon
a journey around the world.

280
00:21:53,289 --> 00:21:55,678
Not in this monstrosity,
you're not. No!

281
00:21:55,892 --> 00:21:57,746
- Mm-mm.
- That's hot.

282
00:21:58,661 --> 00:22:00,450
It's... Ow!

283
00:22:11,975 --> 00:22:14,658
Time to go.
We have a boat to catch.

284
00:22:14,844 --> 00:22:18,140
Stealing a police vehicle is not
an acceptable way to begin our journey.

285
00:22:18,347 --> 00:22:20,452
- Not stealing. Borrowing.
- Excuse us.

286
00:22:20,616 --> 00:22:23,485
We're borrowing this vehicle
to catch our ship to Paris,

287
00:22:23,686 --> 00:22:26,337
if someone could inform
the appropriate authorities.

288
00:22:35,631 --> 00:22:38,664
Bloody hell! Me brain's leakin'!

289
00:22:42,105 --> 00:22:43,632
Ahh! Damn that nincompoop Fix.

290
00:22:43,773 --> 00:22:46,195
What's the point of hiring
a corrupt police officer

291
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:48,742
if he can't abuse the law properly?

292
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:50,285
- Kitchner.
- Sir!

293
00:22:50,414 --> 00:22:52,268
Tell Fix to pack his bags.

294
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:54,357
- He's going on a trip.
- Right away, sir.

295
00:23:44,735 --> 00:23:45,782
Hmm. Smart man.

296
00:23:45,902 --> 00:23:48,269
Passepartout, tell this
impudent fellow we must

297
00:23:48,438 --> 00:23:52,660
leave within six and a half hours, or we
miss our connection in Constantinople.

298
00:23:52,909 --> 00:23:55,691
Yes, sir. Please.
We are in a great hurry.

299
00:23:55,878 --> 00:23:57,088
- Passepartout?
- Yes?

300
00:23:57,213 --> 00:23:59,188
In French.

301
00:24:04,988 --> 00:24:06,777
Sacre bleu, la champignon,

302
00:24:06,922 --> 00:24:10,980
chateau, bien, françoise, voilà,
ooh-la-la, foie de gras.

303
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,226
- What did he say?
- Uh...

304
00:24:20,302 --> 00:24:21,284
He say...

305
00:24:29,112 --> 00:24:31,250
- What?
- He says not to worry.

306
00:24:31,414 --> 00:24:35,343
The next train will leave in five hours.
Good time for sightseeing.

307
00:24:35,585 --> 00:24:39,032
Passepartout, this is
a scientific expedition, not a holiday!

308
00:24:39,288 --> 00:24:41,263
I will not miss this train.

309
00:24:43,092 --> 00:24:44,914
Ah!

310
00:24:45,062 --> 00:24:46,720
- Very amazing.
- What?

311
00:24:46,862 --> 00:24:48,389
What does it say?

312
00:24:48,531 --> 00:24:50,833
Eddie Thomason will be
showing his inventions.

313
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,139
Thomas Edison? Here in Paris?

314
00:24:53,303 --> 00:24:56,172
What a chance for you
to meet another great inventor.

315
00:24:56,372 --> 00:24:59,885
I would quite like to tell him
about my whistle modification.

316
00:25:00,109 --> 00:25:01,189
Good idea.

317
00:25:06,316 --> 00:25:08,683
See? Exposition. Science.

318
00:25:22,465 --> 00:25:25,215
I assure you these are not
the works of Thomas Edison.

319
00:25:25,401 --> 00:25:27,823
Uh, I think he is
somewhere around here.

320
00:25:28,471 --> 00:25:32,181
Wait a moment. This isn't science.

321
00:25:33,142 --> 00:25:34,800
This is art.

322
00:25:34,944 --> 00:25:36,319
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

323
00:25:36,446 --> 00:25:38,551
That painting is highly inaccurate.

324
00:25:38,714 --> 00:25:41,365
It's not supposed
to be accurate.

325
00:25:42,619 --> 00:25:46,394
The artist views reality
through imagination

326
00:25:46,622 --> 00:25:49,721
rather than simply recording it.

327
00:25:49,926 --> 00:25:52,511
It is called "lmpressionism."

328
00:25:53,996 --> 00:25:57,062
Well, um, I'm not impressed.

329
00:25:57,266 --> 00:26:00,681
Trees are not violet,
grass is not charcoal,

330
00:26:00,903 --> 00:26:02,692
and a man cannot...

331
00:26:13,482 --> 00:26:14,889
fly.

332
00:26:15,018 --> 00:26:16,927
You feel something.

333
00:26:17,553 --> 00:26:19,276
You dream of flying.

334
00:26:19,455 --> 00:26:22,041
Or of naked men.

335
00:26:22,225 --> 00:26:24,592
- Sometimes.
- Ah.

336
00:26:24,761 --> 00:26:27,794
The flying. N-N-Not the men.

337
00:26:27,997 --> 00:26:30,812
I am glad you like my painting.
Monique La Roche.

338
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,059
Phileas Fogg. I must say, it's a lot
better than these amateurs.

339
00:26:35,304 --> 00:26:37,279
What did he say?

340
00:26:40,009 --> 00:26:42,627
Oh, no.

341
00:26:54,657 --> 00:26:55,901
Non.

342
00:27:11,941 --> 00:27:14,658
Goodness. What was that all about?

343
00:27:14,844 --> 00:27:18,619
Well, a wealthy gentleman
bought my painting for a lot of money.

344
00:27:19,515 --> 00:27:21,238
Champagne for everyone!

345
00:27:34,564 --> 00:27:38,458
I'm still looking for Mr. Eddie.
Nice painting.

346
00:27:41,337 --> 00:27:43,923
Have you considered
a career in schematic drawing?

347
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,325
No. It would be far too limiting.

348
00:27:47,508 --> 00:27:49,712
At least your work
shows genuine promise.

349
00:27:51,247 --> 00:27:55,022
Thank you. Those I painted
many months ago.

350
00:27:55,251 --> 00:27:57,106
I was lacking inspiration.

351
00:27:57,287 --> 00:28:00,735
I found some men
to help me find Mr. "Edimon."

352
00:28:02,025 --> 00:28:04,840
- This way.
- Thank you. Thank you.

353
00:28:06,794 --> 00:28:08,071
He's very eager.

354
00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:11,641
Get him!

355
00:28:19,475 --> 00:28:23,305
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Oh, it's terrible, no?

356
00:28:23,544 --> 00:28:25,006
No, no, it's...

357
00:28:25,148 --> 00:28:26,358
- clever.
- Oh.

358
00:28:26,482 --> 00:28:27,627
Hmm. Yes.

359
00:28:28,183 --> 00:28:29,612
- He's a clown.
- Mm-hmm.

360
00:28:29,786 --> 00:28:31,728
And yet...

361
00:28:31,921 --> 00:28:34,026
he's incredibly angry.

362
00:28:34,223 --> 00:28:37,518
The irony is, uh, terrifying.

363
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,648
- Is that good?
- Is it?

364
00:29:09,191 --> 00:29:10,532
Ah, this is interesting.

365
00:29:12,028 --> 00:29:15,061
Without opposable thumbs,
a dog could never play poker.

366
00:29:15,264 --> 00:29:17,403
Yes, they can.

367
00:29:17,566 --> 00:29:19,475
Where have you seen
a dog playing poker?

368
00:29:20,436 --> 00:29:22,127
Right there.

369
00:29:55,535 --> 00:29:57,707
Perhaps I'm not the best judge.

370
00:30:00,141 --> 00:30:03,141
Bandits! They come to take away
all the paintings!

371
00:30:13,286 --> 00:30:16,450
- Quickly! Come this way!
- Passepartout!

372
00:30:19,191 --> 00:30:20,369
Go, go, go!

373
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:46,272
Thank you, Miss La Roche.
You may just have saved our trip.

374
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,909
- There you are.
- I would, uh...

375
00:30:49,121 --> 00:30:51,772
- I would like to repay you.
- Take me with you.

376
00:30:51,958 --> 00:30:55,537
- What?
- I'm stifled here. Pigeonholed.

377
00:30:55,763 --> 00:30:59,243
They think of me only
as a coat-check girl!

378
00:30:59,467 --> 00:31:02,816
- Why?
- Because I am the coat-check girl.

379
00:31:03,404 --> 00:31:04,549
- Ah.
- Look.

380
00:31:04,671 --> 00:31:07,191
The leading art critic in Paris.

381
00:31:07,374 --> 00:31:09,763
Look what he wrote
about one of my paintings.

382
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:13,758
- I can't read this. It's French.
- I wish I couldn't.

383
00:31:13,948 --> 00:31:15,573
Why do you carry it?

384
00:31:15,715 --> 00:31:20,472
When I do succeed,
I can throw it in his face, but for now,

385
00:31:20,755 --> 00:31:23,602
I need a world journey to inspire me.

386
00:31:27,694 --> 00:31:30,857
I'm inspired to get us
back on schedule.

387
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:36,360
Let's see. Wind velocity
approximately twelve knots,

388
00:31:36,604 --> 00:31:39,254
factoring in air density...

389
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,650
Outstanding!

390
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:43,905
Passepartout, onward! Ah.

391
00:31:51,152 --> 00:31:54,086
There we go. Passepartout,
tell him to keep the change.

392
00:31:54,321 --> 00:31:56,623
Uh...
fromage, por favor.

393
00:31:58,191 --> 00:32:00,297
We are going around
the world in 80 days!

394
00:32:06,198 --> 00:32:08,238
The balloon cannot
support all this weight!

395
00:32:08,435 --> 00:32:10,802
Your hot air should compensate, no?

396
00:32:10,937 --> 00:32:12,879
Get off!

397
00:32:20,614 --> 00:32:23,331
- What are they doing?
- They're being disorderly.

398
00:32:23,517 --> 00:32:25,459
Hey! Let go! Let go!

399
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:30,257
Hey! Passepartout!
My valise! It has all my money in it.

400
00:32:42,202 --> 00:32:44,471
Hey, lady, lady, lady! It's my bag.

401
00:32:44,638 --> 00:32:46,493
No, that is my bag.

402
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,128
No, that's not your bag. It's my bag!

403
00:32:49,309 --> 00:32:50,323
- No!
- You crazy.

404
00:32:50,443 --> 00:32:51,872
Yes.

405
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:55,721
That tickles!

406
00:33:02,822 --> 00:33:04,196
You took my bag.

407
00:33:04,325 --> 00:33:06,081
Mr. Fogg!

408
00:33:07,561 --> 00:33:08,739
- Good catch!
- Thank you.

409
00:33:21,741 --> 00:33:22,919
Ooh!

410
00:33:26,812 --> 00:33:28,820
Those are the gallery bandits.

411
00:33:37,524 --> 00:33:39,531
Oh, yes!

412
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:41,634
Ah.

413
00:33:46,666 --> 00:33:49,962
He stole my purse!
This devil stole my purse!

414
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:16,049
My bag! He took my... Ah!

415
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:21,140
- We've stolen that old lady's purse.
- Huh. Here.

416
00:34:24,371 --> 00:34:28,430
We must help Passepartout.
How do I make this go lower?

417
00:34:28,676 --> 00:34:31,294
What are you doing?
Decrease the overall weight...

418
00:34:31,478 --> 00:34:33,616
- That's not going to work.
- Yes, it is.

419
00:34:37,851 --> 00:34:39,574
Physics, no?

420
00:34:39,754 --> 00:34:41,510
Yes.

421
00:34:55,902 --> 00:34:57,812
Ahhh...

422
00:34:57,972 --> 00:35:00,176
Ooh! Ay! Owww.

423
00:35:10,283 --> 00:35:11,461
Bonjour.

424
00:35:11,618 --> 00:35:14,552
Bonjour.

425
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,565
- Eh?
- Bye-bye!

426
00:35:25,433 --> 00:35:27,571
Wake up, lady! Wake up, lady!

427
00:35:32,138 --> 00:35:34,472
Wake up! Lady, wake up!

428
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,439
- Bye, mama.
- Merci.

429
00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:46,546
Bye, baby.

430
00:35:49,156 --> 00:35:51,066
Ohh...

431
00:35:57,765 --> 00:36:00,612
Very impressive. I'd have let go by now.

432
00:36:05,672 --> 00:36:08,061
The statue's grabbing his trousers.

433
00:36:08,274 --> 00:36:10,314
I don't think it's doing it on purpose.

434
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:26,887
Oh, dear.

435
00:36:36,169 --> 00:36:38,886
Help!

436
00:36:46,947 --> 00:36:48,507
Well done, Passepartout.

437
00:36:48,648 --> 00:36:51,496
We're still on schedule
despite those dogged thieves.

438
00:36:51,684 --> 00:36:53,506
Yes, yes. Thank you.

439
00:36:57,524 --> 00:37:00,622
Those art thieves
seemed to recognize you.

440
00:37:01,629 --> 00:37:06,233
- I look like someone they know.
- Some other Frenchman, perhaps?

441
00:37:08,636 --> 00:37:13,971
- So, where can we drop you off?
- We're not stopping.

442
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:17,121
Once we land to board
the Orient Express, you are free to go.

443
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:18,685
Thank you so much.

444
00:37:19,747 --> 00:37:22,168
- For what?
- I'm free to go with you.

445
00:37:22,348 --> 00:37:24,803
I did not say you were free to come.

446
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:26,742
- I said you were free to go.
- Where?

447
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,121
- Anywhere.
- Thank you. I will go with you.

448
00:37:32,192 --> 00:37:35,258
- No, you will not, Miss La Roche.
- Monique.

449
00:37:35,528 --> 00:37:36,608
Miss... Monique!

450
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,559
There! Now we are getting along.

451
00:37:41,769 --> 00:37:43,776
Comme c'est beau.

452
00:37:43,938 --> 00:37:45,978
C'est magnifique.

453
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,400
Toutes ces couleurs.

454
00:37:49,543 --> 00:37:53,155
Look at the sunrise.
There is only one word for it.

455
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,868
- "Magical."
- Miss La Roche!

456
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:58,919
I refuse to allow you
to continue traveling with us.

457
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:02,982
I'm not traveling with you.
I'm making my own way.

458
00:38:03,256 --> 00:38:05,111
Maybe you shouldn't travel with me.

459
00:38:05,258 --> 00:38:07,779
This is what happens
when you leave your home.

460
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,744
You meet... people!

461
00:38:19,205 --> 00:38:22,304
Why are you keeping up this ruse?

462
00:38:25,812 --> 00:38:30,995
Perhaps I should inform Mr. Fogg,
and together he and I can speculate.

463
00:38:40,528 --> 00:38:44,554
A very sacred object
was stolen from my village.

464
00:38:44,797 --> 00:38:46,706
I have taken it back.

465
00:38:56,911 --> 00:38:58,155
Incroyable.

466
00:38:59,145 --> 00:39:02,855
For many centuries, the Jade Buddha
has protected my people.

467
00:39:03,083 --> 00:39:06,182
It has never left our village until now.

468
00:39:09,155 --> 00:39:12,090
And those art thieves. Who are they?

469
00:39:12,325 --> 00:39:16,668
The Black Scorpions.
They work for an evil warlord. Fang.

470
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:20,377
She wants the Buddha
so she can take over my village.

471
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,495
I must return the Jade Buddha
to protect Lanzhou.

472
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:27,421
Mr. Fogg is the fastest way.

473
00:39:28,808 --> 00:39:32,354
Perhaps, then,
we can help one another.

474
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:36,825
I will keep your secret,
and you convince Mr. Fogg

475
00:39:37,051 --> 00:39:39,472
to allow me to travel
the world with you.

476
00:39:46,694 --> 00:39:50,971
Keep this Dummkopf in his seat,
or we throw him off!

477
00:39:52,766 --> 00:39:56,759
Merely pointing out if they coordinated
their coal-shoveling technique,

478
00:39:57,003 --> 00:40:00,232
they could maximize our speed.

479
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:06,816
When we reach Constantinople, I suggest
you board a train we are not on.

480
00:40:07,982 --> 00:40:12,553
- Uh, Mr. Fogg, she must come with us.
- And why is that?

481
00:40:12,853 --> 00:40:17,457
Uh, we just discovered that we are
related from the same family.

482
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:25,778
I'm her father's second cousin's sister
on my mother's side. French.

483
00:40:27,767 --> 00:40:31,444
Monsieur Fogg. If I make the train
go faster, I can come with you, oui?

484
00:40:31,671 --> 00:40:34,257
Yes.

485
00:40:37,744 --> 00:40:40,362
I bid you farewell, Miss La Roche.

486
00:40:55,461 --> 00:40:59,454
If there's anything else you would like,
just let us know, Miss La Roche.

487
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,990
Ah! Voilà.

488
00:41:02,135 --> 00:41:06,162
Champagne with your first-class seats,
Mademoiselle La Roche.

489
00:41:06,407 --> 00:41:07,486
Merci.

490
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,815
- Champagne?
- No, thank you.

491
00:41:13,013 --> 00:41:14,671
- Merci.
- Monsieur.

492
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:23,829
A tea?

493
00:41:46,412 --> 00:41:47,427
Okay.

494
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,732
How to make English tea.

495
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:56,172
Precisely 96 degrees.

496
00:42:01,994 --> 00:42:03,074
Ooh.

497
00:42:04,197 --> 00:42:05,758
Excuse me, sir.

498
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:08,745
- Fogg's valet!

499
00:42:08,968 --> 00:42:11,837
- A jade Buddha!
- This is not a jade Buddha.

500
00:42:12,005 --> 00:42:16,063
- Oh, yes, it is!
- You're right. But I'm not a valet.

501
00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:18,219
Oh. Really?

502
00:42:19,979 --> 00:42:21,124
Owww!

503
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:24,357
Me bloody nose!

504
00:42:24,551 --> 00:42:28,195
Let me in!
You're gonna pay for scorchin' me willy!

505
00:42:42,902 --> 00:42:45,422
Heh-heh-heh-heh. Now I gotcha.

506
00:42:46,706 --> 00:42:49,706
Ow! Oh! Ow!

507
00:42:49,909 --> 00:42:52,909
Ahhh!

508
00:42:53,113 --> 00:42:55,022
You're under arrest!

509
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:59,286
Ah! Ooh! Ow!

510
00:43:00,353 --> 00:43:01,695
Sorry!

511
00:43:18,705 --> 00:43:20,614
Why the devil are we stopping?

512
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:30,718
Prince Hapi would be honored
to have Fogg

513
00:43:30,883 --> 00:43:33,087
and his traveling companions
at his banquet.

514
00:43:33,287 --> 00:43:34,880
How very flattering.

515
00:43:35,056 --> 00:43:38,951
But please inform Prince "Happy"
that we are on a very tight schedule.

516
00:43:40,061 --> 00:43:42,810
Prince Hapi demands it.

517
00:43:43,598 --> 00:43:46,762
Then Prince Hapi
will have to get accustomed

518
00:43:46,967 --> 00:43:49,106
to not getting everything he wants.

519
00:43:56,711 --> 00:43:58,718
It is magnificent.

520
00:43:58,879 --> 00:44:01,596
Mr. Fogg, his house
is even bigger than yours.

521
00:44:01,782 --> 00:44:05,427
His collection, his taste...
It is exquisite.

522
00:44:05,653 --> 00:44:07,082
Yes, it is.

523
00:44:08,422 --> 00:44:11,324
Not good.
Very old. Look. Broken.

524
00:44:11,525 --> 00:44:14,395
And where is His Highness?

525
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:26,715
Oh. The prince is also
a talented musician.

526
00:44:26,941 --> 00:44:29,559
If I did nothing
but lounge about the palace,

527
00:44:29,743 --> 00:44:31,783
I'd learn to pluck a few notes.

528
00:44:44,791 --> 00:44:47,311
Let's make this brief.
I'll pose for photographs,

529
00:44:47,527 --> 00:44:49,415
wearing a turban,
holding an atlas...

530
00:44:49,596 --> 00:44:51,003
Mademoiselle.

531
00:44:53,367 --> 00:44:58,223
How magical that our paths should cross.
Do you believe in fate?

532
00:44:58,506 --> 00:45:00,033
Is that what you call it

533
00:45:00,173 --> 00:45:02,726
when one stops a train
and kidnaps its passengers?

534
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,918
Phileas Fogg.

535
00:45:05,078 --> 00:45:06,539
Please forgive me,

536
00:45:06,681 --> 00:45:11,089
but I feel like Aphrodite herself
descended to Earth.

537
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:14,029
What is a ravishing
woman like you...

538
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:20,845
- I never think when I'm naked.
- I do. In the bath.

539
00:45:21,128 --> 00:45:22,786
- Yes. Well, I mean...
- No!

540
00:45:22,963 --> 00:45:24,850
Don't touch it!

541
00:45:25,032 --> 00:45:30,215
- That is my most treasured possession.
- I was only pointing. I was just...

542
00:45:30,504 --> 00:45:32,293
Don't even point.

543
00:45:32,439 --> 00:45:33,999
Rodin.

544
00:45:34,141 --> 00:45:37,141
Yes. A Rodin.

545
00:45:37,344 --> 00:45:38,686
Oh.

546
00:45:38,812 --> 00:45:42,161
I have never seen a more beautiful...
muscular form.

547
00:45:42,382 --> 00:45:46,211
Well, I can assure you,
I'm in much better shape now.

548
00:45:46,454 --> 00:45:49,585
Incroyable. It is a sculpture of you!

549
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:50,935
Yes.

550
00:45:51,059 --> 00:45:54,027
"Hapi Birthday.
Your pal, Rodin."

551
00:45:54,261 --> 00:45:57,458
- Come, my dear. Let us dine.
- Yes.

552
00:45:59,467 --> 00:46:02,314
Ah, Mr. Fogg, please join us.

553
00:46:02,502 --> 00:46:04,412
No, sorry. We are on a tight schedule.

554
00:46:04,572 --> 00:46:07,387
We will join you, actually.
But just one drink.

555
00:46:13,447 --> 00:46:16,611
After the duke and the duchess
sat down in the bath,

556
00:46:16,817 --> 00:46:19,370
I realized I forgot
to put on my bathing suit.

557
00:46:25,492 --> 00:46:26,768
I'm such a fool.

558
00:46:26,927 --> 00:46:30,789
Always embarrassing myself
in front of visiting dignitaries.

559
00:46:31,065 --> 00:46:33,967
But you know how that can be,
right, Phil?

560
00:46:34,201 --> 00:46:36,088
Uh, yes.

561
00:46:36,237 --> 00:46:38,855
Uh, it's Phileas, actually.

562
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:42,552
So, Foggy, tell me.
I heard you're an inventor.

563
00:46:42,776 --> 00:46:46,005
Well, I try to apply myself
to thinking of new ways

564
00:46:46,213 --> 00:46:48,701
to help better mankind,
if that's what you mean.

565
00:46:48,883 --> 00:46:50,738
Well, I'm not an inventor,

566
00:46:50,884 --> 00:46:54,364
but I did develop a new way
of irrigating dry land

567
00:46:54,588 --> 00:46:57,435
so that no one in my kingdom
ever has to be hungry.

568
00:46:57,625 --> 00:46:58,737
Oh.

569
00:47:00,794 --> 00:47:02,769
Mr. Fogg invented wheelie shoes.

570
00:47:06,333 --> 00:47:08,155
Not now, Passepartout.

571
00:47:10,437 --> 00:47:12,160
Oh.

572
00:47:12,305 --> 00:47:13,712
Mmm.

573
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:15,301
- Miss La Roche.
- Hmm?

574
00:47:15,443 --> 00:47:19,469
It is mesmerizing,
the way your face illuminates.

575
00:47:19,713 --> 00:47:20,858
Oh...

576
00:47:20,981 --> 00:47:23,664
Her discoloration could be
an allergic reaction

577
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:26,403
or a mild form of hives.

578
00:47:28,723 --> 00:47:31,887
Although I've noticed a certain

579
00:47:32,092 --> 00:47:35,637
luminescent glow about her
complexion when she's drawing.

580
00:47:35,897 --> 00:47:40,240
And sometimes, when she's...
concentrating on her latest work,

581
00:47:40,534 --> 00:47:42,989
her ears will actually flutter.

582
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:50,248
- It's rather fetching.
- Guess who else was in this bath.

583
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:53,445
U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes.

584
00:47:55,383 --> 00:47:57,969
Shouldn't we be going?
We have a schedule to keep.

585
00:47:58,152 --> 00:48:00,126
Thank you for your hospitality.

586
00:48:00,287 --> 00:48:03,833
It's been absolutely fascinating,
but I'm afraid we must push on.

587
00:48:04,058 --> 00:48:05,040
Yes.

588
00:48:05,192 --> 00:48:07,080
Very well.
The gentlemen are free to go.

589
00:48:07,195 --> 00:48:10,544
But Miss La Roche...
stays here with me.

590
00:48:11,364 --> 00:48:13,274
- To be my wife.
- Hmm?

591
00:48:13,467 --> 00:48:15,955
Yes. Wife number seven.

592
00:48:16,804 --> 00:48:19,935
- You have seven wives?
- One for each day of the week.

593
00:48:22,676 --> 00:48:25,971
- This is absolutely ridiculous!
- No more talk!

594
00:48:26,178 --> 00:48:27,585
Prince Hapi has spoken!

595
00:48:30,351 --> 00:48:33,798
Well, we did say one drink.
Passepartout, we're leaving.

596
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:36,060
I can tell when we're not wanted.

597
00:48:40,327 --> 00:48:41,275
Monsieur Fogg!

598
00:48:42,562 --> 00:48:44,734
Do Tuesdays work for you?

599
00:48:45,866 --> 00:48:48,517
- Good-bye.
- Thank you!

600
00:48:52,606 --> 00:48:54,940
No!

601
00:48:56,076 --> 00:48:57,091
Halt!

602
00:48:57,712 --> 00:48:59,239
Or Hapi gets smashed!

603
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:03,340
Please! Anything but my statue of me!

604
00:49:03,582 --> 00:49:06,965
Miss La Roche,
please join us, if you will.

605
00:49:08,523 --> 00:49:12,800
- All of you, drop your weapons.
- Do as he says!

606
00:49:14,327 --> 00:49:16,913
- Get in the tent.
- Everybody!

607
00:49:17,131 --> 00:49:20,392
- Now!
- Let's go. Come on.

608
00:49:27,007 --> 00:49:31,163
Now, take off your clothes
and throw them... Uh...

609
00:49:31,412 --> 00:49:35,186
I assure you the statue is not
armed... harmed in any way.

610
00:49:50,931 --> 00:49:53,713
Get them!

611
00:49:56,804 --> 00:49:58,178
His arm!

612
00:49:59,539 --> 00:50:01,711
Thank you, Phileas.
That was very heroic.

613
00:50:01,876 --> 00:50:04,429
Yes, and needlessly time-consuming.

614
00:50:04,611 --> 00:50:07,742
This is exactly why
I should never have let you come along.

615
00:50:07,948 --> 00:50:09,126
Kill them!

616
00:50:09,849 --> 00:50:13,395
I want my arm!

617
00:50:13,621 --> 00:50:16,621
No!

618
00:50:16,824 --> 00:50:20,402
Sir! I've received a telegram
from Inspector Fix.

619
00:50:20,659 --> 00:50:22,764
- A-ha!
- According to him,

620
00:50:22,963 --> 00:50:26,062
the bank thief and Fogg's valet
are the same man.

621
00:50:26,266 --> 00:50:29,200
Fogg doesn't realize
he's transporting the bank thief!

622
00:50:29,402 --> 00:50:33,592
Or does he?
He did leave town in quite a hurry.

623
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:35,727
Wouldn't you say, Lord Rhodes?

624
00:50:35,875 --> 00:50:37,730
Indeed, Lord Salisbury.

625
00:50:37,877 --> 00:50:39,819
Eh, evading arrest,

626
00:50:39,981 --> 00:50:42,250
stealing a police vehicle,

627
00:50:42,416 --> 00:50:45,034
sounds rather incriminating to me.

628
00:50:45,218 --> 00:50:47,041
One can almost deduce

629
00:50:47,187 --> 00:50:49,838
this entire bet was merely a ruse

630
00:50:50,024 --> 00:50:52,031
to facilitate his escape.

631
00:50:52,892 --> 00:50:56,602
- Don't you agree, Lord Kelvin?
- Yes.

632
00:50:56,831 --> 00:50:58,391
Brilliant, Lord Salisbury.

633
00:50:58,566 --> 00:51:02,210
I shall name a beef-related entrée
after you in your honor! Kitchner!

634
00:51:02,435 --> 00:51:04,443
- Sir!
- Inform your men at Scotland Yard

635
00:51:04,604 --> 00:51:09,787
that Phileas Fogg is without a doubt
the man who robbed the Bank of England!

636
00:51:10,111 --> 00:51:13,493
- Where are they now?
- They're taking a train across India,

637
00:51:13,681 --> 00:51:15,175
from Bombay to Calcutta.

638
00:51:15,316 --> 00:51:17,487
Thank God we own India!

639
00:51:17,652 --> 00:51:19,921
I want their faces
in every police station,

640
00:51:20,086 --> 00:51:22,475
army barracks, post office,
railway station and outhouse in India!

641
00:51:24,824 --> 00:51:27,377
We're going to stop Fogg
and get my Jade Buddha back

642
00:51:27,595 --> 00:51:30,213
by any means necessary!

643
00:51:38,204 --> 00:51:40,692
Agra is where we will capture them!

644
00:51:49,049 --> 00:51:51,285
Intercept them at Agra!

645
00:51:51,452 --> 00:51:53,110
Carry on, Cutter!

646
00:51:53,253 --> 00:51:55,587
Move it! Move it! Fall in!

647
00:52:06,766 --> 00:52:09,483
And they were
the greatest kung fu boxers.

648
00:52:09,703 --> 00:52:12,125
Ten Tigers of Canton.

649
00:52:12,272 --> 00:52:13,548
Brothers in arms.

650
00:52:13,673 --> 00:52:16,324
They fought to keep order
and justice in China.

651
00:52:16,509 --> 00:52:19,826
The most famous of Ten Tigers
is Wong Fei Hung.

652
00:52:24,819 --> 00:52:27,186
Armed with
only bamboo sticks...

653
00:52:27,355 --> 00:52:29,330
It's salivating on... please.

654
00:52:29,489 --> 00:52:30,917
Is this your goat?

655
00:52:31,057 --> 00:52:33,130
Did they really fight like tigers?

656
00:52:33,326 --> 00:52:36,425
Each Tiger have their own
animal fighting style.

657
00:52:36,663 --> 00:52:38,867
Like tiger.

658
00:52:39,032 --> 00:52:41,966
Snake. Snake head, snake tail,
snake mouth, snake tongue!

659
00:52:43,137 --> 00:52:44,795
Where are my calculations?

660
00:52:44,938 --> 00:52:46,279
Monkey!

661
00:52:47,407 --> 00:52:50,887
The goat! Passepartout, I'm being
attacked by a ferocious animal!

662
00:52:52,178 --> 00:52:55,080
- It has small horns.
- Sorry, Mr. Fogg.

663
00:52:55,281 --> 00:52:58,063
Please keep that inconsiderate
beast away from me.

664
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:00,225
And refrain from ridiculous anecdotes.

665
00:53:00,387 --> 00:53:03,169
Why do you not like his story, Mr. Frog?

666
00:53:03,857 --> 00:53:05,515
It's Fogg. Phileas Fogg.

667
00:53:06,292 --> 00:53:10,515
How could a man learn to defend himself
by watching animals behave like...

668
00:53:10,798 --> 00:53:13,099
- animals?
- It is famous legend.

669
00:53:13,266 --> 00:53:17,063
- A ridiculous legend.
- Most legends are born from truth.

670
00:53:17,337 --> 00:53:19,027
Yes.

671
00:53:19,172 --> 00:53:22,489
But all truths are born from facts.

672
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:25,295
Solid, tangible facts
that can be calculated

673
00:53:25,478 --> 00:53:27,136
and written down on paper.

674
00:53:27,279 --> 00:53:30,956
And then eaten by a goat.

675
00:53:31,184 --> 00:53:34,119
Mr. Feelsillious,
when I tell the story

676
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,451
of the man who circled
the entire world in 80 days,

677
00:53:37,657 --> 00:53:39,894
would that not be a legend?

678
00:53:42,862 --> 00:53:45,448
Only if the man's name
was Feelsillious Frog.

679
00:53:50,303 --> 00:53:54,776
- What the blazes is it now?
- Come this way! Come on!

680
00:53:55,041 --> 00:53:57,791
Look sharp, now. Get 'em!

681
00:53:57,977 --> 00:53:59,471
Find these men!

682
00:53:59,612 --> 00:54:04,434
Uh-oh. Time to go. They seem to think
we robbed the Bank of England.

683
00:54:04,718 --> 00:54:07,718
Preposterous. This is a desperate
attempt by Lord Kelvin

684
00:54:07,954 --> 00:54:09,067
to impede my journey.

685
00:54:09,155 --> 00:54:11,544
I am a British citizen.
I have nothing to fear.

686
00:54:13,993 --> 00:54:15,902
Except bullets.

687
00:54:17,031 --> 00:54:19,235
Listen up!
Have you seen these men?

688
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,007
Come on!

689
00:54:35,482 --> 00:54:37,337
Any word on the bank thieves, sir?

690
00:54:37,485 --> 00:54:40,005
They were on the train.
Keep your rifles ready.

691
00:54:40,186 --> 00:54:41,648
They won't get past us, sir!

692
00:54:43,723 --> 00:54:46,276
Ladies, have you seen these two men?

693
00:54:47,794 --> 00:54:51,023
Look closely. They're very dangerous.

694
00:54:51,231 --> 00:54:54,133
They're everywhere!
This is not going to work!

695
00:54:54,367 --> 00:54:57,815
- Just act like ladies.
- Not a problem.

696
00:54:58,037 --> 00:55:00,754
Hello. Hello! Ah.

697
00:55:02,208 --> 00:55:05,339
- I feel faint.
- Phileas, women are not that weak!

698
00:55:05,545 --> 00:55:07,618
No, but I am.

699
00:55:14,187 --> 00:55:17,351
Hello, darling.
What can I do for you, eh?

700
00:55:21,896 --> 00:55:26,685
What nice hand,
nice eye, nice hair...

701
00:55:27,934 --> 00:55:29,974
Hang about!

702
00:55:33,439 --> 00:55:36,308
Mr. Fogg, what are you doing?
This is no time to sleep.

703
00:55:36,509 --> 00:55:38,135
Stop, stop.

704
00:55:40,446 --> 00:55:44,221
Go, go, go! Get us out of Agra quickly.

705
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:46,654
Passepartout, we did it.

706
00:55:52,058 --> 00:55:53,968
Hey, wrong way.

707
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,338
Ah!

708
00:56:00,033 --> 00:56:02,105
Phileas? No! No!

709
00:56:06,574 --> 00:56:08,679
Aah! Run! Run, Passepartout!

710
00:56:08,875 --> 00:56:10,468
Ah! Ah!

711
00:56:10,577 --> 00:56:12,137
Ahhh!

712
00:56:12,279 --> 00:56:14,035
Fogg's valet! Heh!

713
00:56:14,682 --> 00:56:16,820
- What are you doing?
- Now I gotcha!

714
00:56:17,418 --> 00:56:19,011
Hand over the Jade Buddha!

715
00:56:20,453 --> 00:56:21,402
Oh!

716
00:56:23,424 --> 00:56:27,101
You're under arrest! Whoa!
Watch me plums! Ooh!

717
00:56:31,865 --> 00:56:35,509
Now you get him very mad! Let's go.

718
00:56:35,735 --> 00:56:37,840
Stop, or I'll arrest you as well!

719
00:56:46,946 --> 00:56:48,856
Run!

720
00:56:50,283 --> 00:56:52,388
- Which way?
- Down!

721
00:56:52,552 --> 00:56:54,462
Again!

722
00:56:55,922 --> 00:56:57,133
Down!

723
00:56:59,827 --> 00:57:00,906
Jump!

724
00:57:04,564 --> 00:57:07,347
- Go, go, go!
- What's upsetting him?

725
00:57:07,566 --> 00:57:10,283
- He wants the Jade Buddha!
- Then give it to him!

726
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:17,917
- Phileas, wake up!
- Please, please. You must go.

727
00:57:19,078 --> 00:57:22,853
- My husband will be home soon.
- Phileas!

728
00:57:35,695 --> 00:57:37,583
Ow! Ay!

729
00:57:41,568 --> 00:57:43,161
Phileas, help!

730
00:57:43,302 --> 00:57:45,124
Leave her alone! I'll protect you!

731
00:57:45,271 --> 00:57:47,126
Ah!

732
00:57:48,207 --> 00:57:49,701
I'm here, my dear.

733
00:57:49,843 --> 00:57:52,745
Uh, that stumble was
simply to buy me time.

734
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:57,044
This cane is not as it appears.

735
00:57:57,250 --> 00:58:01,855
If I depress this button, it would
deploy a weapon more deadly than yours.

736
00:58:05,659 --> 00:58:08,048
This... is...

737
00:58:08,261 --> 00:58:10,814
a strange knife.

738
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:12,437
Isn't it a sextant?

739
00:58:13,399 --> 00:58:15,286
Yes.

740
00:58:22,075 --> 00:58:23,481
Huh.

741
00:58:27,614 --> 00:58:31,956
- Are you all right, my dear?
- Phileas, that was so unlike you. Ah!

742
00:58:32,218 --> 00:58:34,073
You men, come with me!

743
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:37,319
You'd better put this on.

744
00:58:37,523 --> 00:58:40,174
Perhaps I should wear
women's clothing more often.

745
00:58:44,931 --> 00:58:46,841
Oh.

746
00:58:47,033 --> 00:58:48,495
We should run.

747
00:58:48,667 --> 00:58:50,522
- What, now?
- Mm-hmm.

748
00:58:51,604 --> 00:58:53,098
Yes, we should run.

749
00:58:57,510 --> 00:58:59,517
- Break down the door!
- Okay.

750
00:59:01,014 --> 00:59:02,191
No, not me brains!

751
00:59:14,827 --> 00:59:17,194
- Give me the Jade "Bu-ddha"!
- Okay, okay.

752
00:59:17,396 --> 00:59:19,086
What's "Bu-ddha"?

753
00:59:21,601 --> 00:59:24,220
Get ready to jump! Now!

754
00:59:38,185 --> 00:59:41,316
It is him, the Englishman
who robbed the Bank of England!

755
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:44,106
He's escaping in that palkee-garry!

756
00:59:44,291 --> 00:59:46,560
Hey, there he is!

757
00:59:48,094 --> 00:59:50,516
They'll check all trains heading east.

758
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:54,920
If we could make it to the coast, we
can't sail into Singapore or Hong Kong.

759
00:59:55,168 --> 00:59:58,365
- They're both British colonies.
- Does England own everything in Asia?

760
00:59:58,572 --> 01:00:01,888
Not China. Not yet.

761
01:00:56,195 --> 01:00:57,537
Passepartout?

762
01:00:58,932 --> 01:01:03,787
- You look troubled.
- I cannot keep lying to Mr. Fogg.

763
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:05,663
You did what you had to.

764
01:01:05,805 --> 01:01:08,227
The fate of your village
is of far greater importance

765
01:01:08,442 --> 01:01:11,159
than any bet Phileas has made.

766
01:01:11,311 --> 01:01:14,442
If he loses, all it will
cost him his money and pride.

767
01:01:14,648 --> 01:01:17,964
No, Mr. Fogg will lose
much more than that.

768
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:21,920
What do you mean?

769
01:01:26,626 --> 01:01:28,666
My village!

770
01:01:31,931 --> 01:01:35,477
- Your village?
- Uh... I mean,

771
01:01:35,701 --> 01:01:37,555
my, what a village!

772
01:01:37,704 --> 01:01:39,111
Oh, it's beautiful!

773
01:01:40,573 --> 01:01:43,443
We do need to stop and
resupply, but we must be off by morning.

774
01:02:03,864 --> 01:02:05,752
- Lau Xing, Lau Xing.
- Lau Xing, Lau Xing.

775
01:02:05,932 --> 01:02:08,518
Lau Xing.

776
01:02:08,735 --> 01:02:11,833
- Lau Xing.
- Lau Xing.

777
01:02:21,281 --> 01:02:24,859
Goodness, that's quite a welcome.
Do these people know him?

778
01:02:25,084 --> 01:02:28,761
It must be their custom,
the way they welcome all strangers.

779
01:02:28,988 --> 01:02:30,995
- Lau Xing.
- Lau Xing.

780
01:02:45,972 --> 01:02:48,176
Whoo!

781
01:02:49,743 --> 01:02:50,790
Lau Xing.

782
01:03:02,888 --> 01:03:04,317
Lau Xing.

783
01:03:06,257 --> 01:03:07,948
Lau Xing.

784
01:03:10,063 --> 01:03:11,623
Ah. Uh...

785
01:03:38,458 --> 01:03:39,864
Oh. It's beautiful.

786
01:03:39,992 --> 01:03:41,879
You are very talented.

787
01:03:42,028 --> 01:03:43,337
Thank you.

788
01:03:44,663 --> 01:03:46,573
You need more blue.

789
01:03:53,473 --> 01:03:56,123
Fascinating. Absolutely fascinating.

790
01:03:58,878 --> 01:04:01,180
Sorry?

791
01:04:10,657 --> 01:04:11,671
Vile.

792
01:04:11,791 --> 01:04:14,606
Absolutely vile.

793
01:04:23,169 --> 01:04:25,024
Welcome home, Lau Xing.

794
01:04:28,808 --> 01:04:30,532
Your brothers will be proud.

795
01:04:30,677 --> 01:04:33,394
The whole notion of
a lighter-than-air craft cannot work,

796
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:36,100
unless you can
harness the power of helium.

797
01:04:36,282 --> 01:04:38,224
Or hydrogen, which is far better...

798
01:04:41,454 --> 01:04:43,723
Yes, well, couldn't have
put it better myself.

799
01:04:43,889 --> 01:04:48,745
As for this Englishman, do you think
such an association is wise?

800
01:04:49,062 --> 01:04:52,095
He is the most disciplined man
I have ever met.

801
01:04:53,132 --> 01:04:55,019
The crane!

802
01:04:55,168 --> 01:04:57,207
The monkey. Very frightening.

803
01:04:58,370 --> 01:05:01,185
Snake.

804
01:05:01,373 --> 01:05:03,795
And, of course, the eagle.

805
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:08,127
Phileas?

806
01:05:10,249 --> 01:05:13,413
Phileas, I made this for you.

807
01:05:13,619 --> 01:05:17,874
Oh, yes.
Oh, that's very, very good. Yes.

808
01:05:18,124 --> 01:05:19,269
What does this say?

809
01:05:19,391 --> 01:05:22,261
Stupid.

810
01:05:24,597 --> 01:05:25,971
Lau Xing...

811
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:56,102
I've had quite enough.

812
01:05:56,296 --> 01:05:58,238
I just... I...

813
01:06:25,425 --> 01:06:26,472
Ahhh.

814
01:06:26,593 --> 01:06:29,789
I am going to be abominably ill.

815
01:06:43,642 --> 01:06:45,977
I... I want to die.

816
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:49,185
Please kill me.

817
01:07:22,748 --> 01:07:24,919
"Dear Father:

818
01:07:25,084 --> 01:07:28,117
I will find the fastest way to China."

819
01:07:32,091 --> 01:07:33,749
It's strong.

820
01:07:42,202 --> 01:07:44,820
Mr. Fogg, I was going to tell you.

821
01:07:50,744 --> 01:07:54,606
- This is your family.
- My name is not Passepartout.

822
01:07:54,847 --> 01:07:56,538
It is Lau Xing.

823
01:07:57,416 --> 01:08:02,150
- I robbed the Bank of England.
- You robbed the Bank of England?

824
01:08:02,421 --> 01:08:05,999
Not for gold or money,
but for the Jade Buddha.

825
01:08:06,226 --> 01:08:08,593
It was stolen from our village.

826
01:08:08,795 --> 01:08:14,326
Phileas, he had no other choice.
This was his only way to get home.

827
01:08:17,569 --> 01:08:20,798
- You knew about this?
- Well...

828
01:08:22,708 --> 01:08:25,261
I have nothing but respect
for you, Mr. Fogg.

829
01:08:27,613 --> 01:08:30,198
Then respect my deductive reasoning.

830
01:08:30,382 --> 01:08:33,448
You have both used me.

831
01:08:33,652 --> 01:08:35,441
You to escape to China,

832
01:08:35,587 --> 01:08:38,653
and you to travel to further
your impressionistic humbug!

833
01:08:39,124 --> 01:08:42,256
Your overtures of... comradeship,

834
01:08:42,494 --> 01:08:44,436
of friendship, of...

835
01:08:48,867 --> 01:08:51,867
All that was a means to ensure
I would take you along.

836
01:08:52,072 --> 01:08:56,228
My entire life,
I got along splendidly by myself.

837
01:08:56,475 --> 01:09:00,369
You've been pebbles in my shoe,
slowing me down, endangering my life,

838
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:04,615
risking everything,
all I've ever lived for.

839
01:09:04,817 --> 01:09:06,605
And you!

840
01:09:08,087 --> 01:09:09,680
You knew that.

841
01:09:23,203 --> 01:09:26,301
Don't let him go.
He'll be lost by midnight.

842
01:09:27,107 --> 01:09:28,700
Go!

843
01:09:32,678 --> 01:09:35,874
More of your relatives, I suppose.

844
01:09:41,019 --> 01:09:44,052
You can just forget
about a reference.

845
01:09:44,256 --> 01:09:47,639
I beg a thousand pardons, Mr. Fogg.

846
01:09:57,170 --> 01:09:59,079
What's he screaming about?

847
01:09:59,238 --> 01:10:01,693
He's saying, "Please, let me go.
I'm bored."

848
01:10:05,210 --> 01:10:07,152
Why is he in prison?

849
01:10:13,953 --> 01:10:16,124
Urinating in public.

850
01:10:16,288 --> 01:10:19,005
Charming.

851
01:10:19,192 --> 01:10:22,191
At least he had the decency
to be forthcoming about it.

852
01:10:22,429 --> 01:10:25,276
Is there anything you've told me
that's even remotely true?

853
01:10:25,497 --> 01:10:27,123
I really can sing.

854
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,967
# Frère Jacques, Frère Jacques

855
01:10:31,170 --> 01:10:32,926
# Dormez-vous

856
01:10:33,072 --> 01:10:34,446
# Dormez-vous

857
01:10:34,573 --> 01:10:37,224
# Sonnez les matines
Sonnez les matines

858
01:10:37,409 --> 01:10:39,711
# Ding, ding, ding
Ding, ding, ding #

859
01:10:39,878 --> 01:10:42,813
Ding, dang, dong, Passepartout.
Ding, dang, dong.

860
01:10:43,016 --> 01:10:45,285
Look!

861
01:10:48,053 --> 01:10:52,723
Oh, good. Here comes
Mr. Grumpy and the Leatherettes.

862
01:10:58,797 --> 01:11:02,921
- Where is the Jade Buddha?
- You are better off killing me.

863
01:11:04,303 --> 01:11:08,459
You have nerve.
Are your comrades so brave?

864
01:11:09,409 --> 01:11:12,670
Your threats don't frighten me.
Nor does your silly bracelet.

865
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:17,163
All right. It's not silly.

866
01:11:17,349 --> 01:11:21,179
I spit on you! France spits on you!

867
01:11:21,421 --> 01:11:22,795
Vive I'Anjou!

868
01:11:23,857 --> 01:11:26,606
- Your turn will come soon enough.
- Coward!

869
01:11:26,793 --> 01:11:29,640
Leave them alone. Fight me.

870
01:11:29,829 --> 01:11:31,804
Yes, fight him.

871
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:35,134
Let's see how ferocious you really are.

872
01:12:23,316 --> 01:12:25,291
Hey, that's cheating!

873
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:28,508
- Look out!
- Huh?

874
01:12:28,656 --> 01:12:30,696
Left!

875
01:12:34,662 --> 01:12:35,971
Behind you!

876
01:12:39,299 --> 01:12:40,924
No!

877
01:12:41,067 --> 01:12:44,199
- Hit them!
- Silence!

878
01:12:50,109 --> 01:12:51,287
You savages!

879
01:12:52,912 --> 01:12:54,406
Phileas, help him!

880
01:12:54,547 --> 01:12:57,329
- Watch out on the right.
- Huh?

881
01:12:57,518 --> 01:12:58,946
No, my right.

882
01:13:00,154 --> 01:13:01,528
Stop helping me!

883
01:13:01,654 --> 01:13:03,443
What's happening?

884
01:13:03,591 --> 01:13:04,867
Where is Passepartout?

885
01:13:04,991 --> 01:13:06,420
How is he getting on?

886
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:10,650
I wouldn't say he's winning,
but, uh, I think he's doing all right.

887
01:13:18,972 --> 01:13:21,044
Go home to mama.

888
01:13:35,555 --> 01:13:37,727
Huh?

889
01:13:38,826 --> 01:13:42,208
- What took you so long?
- I had to finish my lunch.

890
01:13:52,438 --> 01:13:53,420
Wong Fei Hung!

891
01:13:54,475 --> 01:13:58,184
Surely you're not foolish enough
to take on all of my men by yourself?

892
01:14:03,950 --> 01:14:04,965
Ten Tigers?

893
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:15,151
Kill them!

894
01:14:25,773 --> 01:14:28,871
Execute the prisoners!
I want their heads on pikes!

895
01:14:41,454 --> 01:14:43,276
What's happening?

896
01:14:44,123 --> 01:14:45,683
Phileas!

897
01:14:52,298 --> 01:14:53,705
Ohhh!

898
01:14:55,669 --> 01:14:57,491
Passepartout... Knife!

899
01:15:08,915 --> 01:15:10,988
- Merci.
- You're welcome.

900
01:16:33,534 --> 01:16:37,941
You promise me that Black Scorpions
will never come back to Lanzhou.

901
01:16:58,826 --> 01:17:02,371
These are my brothers and sister.
The Ten Tigers.

902
01:17:02,628 --> 01:17:05,661
- But there are only nine.
- Including me.

903
01:17:05,899 --> 01:17:07,273
They're real.

904
01:17:08,434 --> 01:17:09,994
The legend was true.

905
01:17:58,050 --> 01:18:00,254
- Mr. Fogg...
- Passepartout,

906
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:02,754
or whatever your name is,
save your apologies.

907
01:18:02,922 --> 01:18:06,632
Phileas, he risked his life
for what he believes in.

908
01:18:06,859 --> 01:18:08,866
If anyone understands that, you do.

909
01:18:09,061 --> 01:18:12,476
Please ensure Miss La Roche
finds safe passage home.

910
01:18:12,732 --> 01:18:15,482
This should be adequate.

911
01:18:20,005 --> 01:18:21,412
Oh.

912
01:18:21,541 --> 01:18:24,257
I, uh, believe this is your veil.

913
01:18:28,481 --> 01:18:31,515
I will never dress like a woman again.

914
01:18:33,085 --> 01:18:34,939
Ever.

915
01:18:35,088 --> 01:18:38,349
Mr. Fogg.
Please let me help you win your bet.

916
01:18:39,959 --> 01:18:43,701
I have secured the services
of a more reliable gentleman.

917
01:18:56,008 --> 01:18:57,982
Yes. Well, perhaps I'll just, uh,

918
01:18:58,144 --> 01:18:59,737
travel alone.

919
01:19:51,965 --> 01:19:55,762
Fifi La Belle!
She sings! She dances!

920
01:19:56,035 --> 01:19:59,515
She does the dance of the...
You, sir, come right in.

921
01:19:59,739 --> 01:20:02,357
See Miss Fifi La Belle in all her...

922
01:20:02,542 --> 01:20:06,884
Ah, the most modern city in the world.

923
01:20:07,146 --> 01:20:09,961
Finally, civilization.

924
01:20:17,023 --> 01:20:19,544
Excuse me. Pardon me.

925
01:20:19,726 --> 01:20:23,555
Can anyone direct me
to the Pacific Railroad Station?

926
01:20:26,633 --> 01:20:28,520
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.

927
01:20:28,701 --> 01:20:31,734
I'm such a... rutabaga sometimes.

928
01:20:31,937 --> 01:20:34,272
No, no, no.
Please, it's my fault entirely.

929
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:37,604
- Let me, uh...
- Oh... Ah!

930
01:20:37,811 --> 01:20:40,593
Oh. Oh, Lord,
I think I sprained my knee.

931
01:20:40,780 --> 01:20:42,722
Uh! Ooh.

932
01:20:42,882 --> 01:20:44,987
I should find you a physician.

933
01:20:45,151 --> 01:20:47,769
There's a doctor who has
an office around the corner.

934
01:20:47,953 --> 01:20:51,499
Excellent.
Well, uh, I'll get him for you.

935
01:20:51,724 --> 01:20:52,804
Thank you.

936
01:20:52,925 --> 01:20:56,220
There should be more people
like you in this world.

937
01:20:58,564 --> 01:21:01,281
Whoo, doggy! Jackpot!

938
01:21:05,472 --> 01:21:08,025
Whoo!

939
01:21:17,384 --> 01:21:18,977
Mon Dieu.

940
01:21:19,118 --> 01:21:22,467
Can you imagine Phileas alone
in a place like this?

941
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:24,182
I'm sure he's fine.

942
01:21:25,792 --> 01:21:28,345
Alms.

943
01:21:28,528 --> 01:21:30,316
Alms.

944
01:21:31,730 --> 01:21:33,454
Alms for the poor?

945
01:21:38,137 --> 01:21:39,249
Arms?

946
01:21:40,406 --> 01:21:43,821
You already got arms.
It's money you need.

947
01:21:44,878 --> 01:21:47,977
I can't even scrounge proficiently.

948
01:21:48,180 --> 01:21:49,554
Hey.

949
01:21:50,216 --> 01:21:53,794
Cheer up, pal. You just gotta
figure out what'll work for you.

950
01:21:54,019 --> 01:21:58,013
Now, what makes you
different from them?

951
01:21:58,258 --> 01:22:00,527
I'm hungry and miserable.

952
01:22:00,694 --> 01:22:03,247
No. You stink.

953
01:22:04,028 --> 01:22:08,218
Your stink is your most powerful weapon
in your begging arsenal.

954
01:22:08,501 --> 01:22:10,127
Watch this.

955
01:22:12,771 --> 01:22:14,495
Hey.

956
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:17,128
- Give me money.
- Sure. Don't touch me. You stink.

957
01:22:18,812 --> 01:22:21,659
- That guy smells like a dead horse!
- I'm not proud of it.

958
01:22:21,847 --> 01:22:24,497
Simple, yet effective.

959
01:22:24,683 --> 01:22:26,112
- Yeah, I see.
- You try.

960
01:22:26,252 --> 01:22:29,187
Give it a shot. I got faith in you.

961
01:22:30,123 --> 01:22:34,051
Excuse me. Now, uh, you...

962
01:22:37,663 --> 01:22:38,611
Ah.

963
01:22:38,764 --> 01:22:42,473
I'm not gonna lie to you.
That's gonna happen about half the time.

964
01:22:45,305 --> 01:22:47,214
It's a volume business.

965
01:22:49,475 --> 01:22:52,508
- Hunk of cheese?
- Oh, yes, I would rather...

966
01:22:52,711 --> 01:22:54,238
Maybe later.

967
01:22:55,849 --> 01:22:58,664
What are them drawings?
You some kind of devil worshipper?

968
01:22:59,653 --> 01:23:02,108
Don't you be putting a hex on me.
I'll cut you.

969
01:23:03,590 --> 01:23:06,524
- I'm an inventor.
- That's nice.

970
01:23:06,725 --> 01:23:08,962
Or, rather, I was.

971
01:23:17,804 --> 01:23:21,099
One day I will build a machine
that will allow man to fly.

972
01:23:21,908 --> 01:23:24,144
Flying men? Where?

973
01:23:25,477 --> 01:23:29,023
- Nowhere.
- Where are the flying men?

974
01:23:29,248 --> 01:23:31,320
- Where are the flying men?
- Over there.

975
01:23:31,483 --> 01:23:33,687
The bird men are coming! I knew it!

976
01:23:33,852 --> 01:23:36,787
The bird men are coming!
The bird men are coming!

977
01:23:36,990 --> 01:23:39,259
The birds! The bird men!

978
01:23:39,426 --> 01:23:41,313
Bird men! Birds!

979
01:23:50,603 --> 01:23:53,669
"I traveled the world for inspiration

980
01:23:53,872 --> 01:23:58,542
and found it in a man...
who lives what he dreams."

981
01:24:39,618 --> 01:24:42,553
- Phileas?
- No.

982
01:24:43,589 --> 01:24:46,010
Passepartout! Monique!

983
01:24:48,661 --> 01:24:49,676
Mr. Fogg.

984
01:24:52,231 --> 01:24:56,006
You crossed the Pacific Ocean.
For me?

985
01:24:56,236 --> 01:25:00,164
- We will help you win your bet.
- Mr. Fogg, I would never let you down.

986
01:25:01,373 --> 01:25:04,722
- But why would you do this?
- Because you are our friend,

987
01:25:04,943 --> 01:25:07,693
and perhaps... more.

988
01:25:09,415 --> 01:25:12,895
More with her. You and me?
We just stick with friends.

989
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,681
- Ooh.
- Oof!

990
01:25:16,823 --> 01:25:20,849
Lord Kelvin, I can
offer you something much more precious

991
01:25:21,093 --> 01:25:23,165
than a single Jade Buddha.

992
01:25:23,329 --> 01:25:27,006
Beneath Lanzhou are a series
of untapped jade reserves.

993
01:25:27,264 --> 01:25:31,868
If the town were to be overrun,
those reserves would be ours.

994
01:25:32,135 --> 01:25:33,248
I see.

995
01:25:33,370 --> 01:25:36,403
However, should Phileas Fogg
win this race,

996
01:25:36,606 --> 01:25:41,396
I will have neither the power nor
the means to hand over any arsenal.

997
01:25:41,678 --> 01:25:46,697
Then I will see to it personally
that Mr. Fogg's journey is cut short.

998
01:25:46,984 --> 01:25:51,010
Very well.
Let us consider our deal to be...

999
01:25:53,523 --> 01:25:56,371
Still, it's a first-rate idea, sir.

1000
01:25:56,561 --> 01:26:00,717
What's this blocking my jade reserves?
That will have to be demolished.

1001
01:26:00,997 --> 01:26:02,274
But that is
the Great Wall of China, sir.

1002
01:26:02,399 --> 01:26:04,286
But that is
the Great Wall of China, sir.

1003
01:26:05,469 --> 01:26:07,062
It's not that great.

1004
01:26:17,481 --> 01:26:20,677
Passepartout went
to get help hours ago.

1005
01:26:20,885 --> 01:26:23,121
What if he's lost, or...

1006
01:26:23,286 --> 01:26:25,010
Don't fret, my dear.

1007
01:26:25,155 --> 01:26:29,246
Passepartout's a warrior
with impeccable survival instincts.

1008
01:26:29,493 --> 01:26:33,486
No doubt he'll return with help, and we
will board our train with time to spare.

1009
01:26:33,765 --> 01:26:35,172
Agua.

1010
01:26:36,266 --> 01:26:38,950
Perhaps I'm being a little optimistic.

1011
01:26:39,136 --> 01:26:40,346
Help!

1012
01:26:40,470 --> 01:26:42,292
- Help us!
- Help!

1013
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:44,447
Ah! A rattlesnake!

1014
01:26:44,609 --> 01:26:45,591
Help!

1015
01:26:45,709 --> 01:26:47,880
I don't want to die!

1016
01:26:48,044 --> 01:26:50,183
Ah. Good morning.

1017
01:26:52,215 --> 01:26:53,906
- Howdy.
- Hey.

1018
01:26:54,050 --> 01:26:56,352
Crazy English cowboy wannabe man.

1019
01:26:56,520 --> 01:27:00,295
How's about going someplace else?
You're blocking the path.

1020
01:27:00,525 --> 01:27:02,434
Wilbur, it's him.

1021
01:27:04,462 --> 01:27:05,639
I'll be damned.

1022
01:27:07,330 --> 01:27:11,007
Mr. Fogg, my name is Orville Wright.
This is my brother, Wilbur.

1023
01:27:11,234 --> 01:27:14,529
- We're big fans of yours.
- Fan's a strong word.

1024
01:27:14,771 --> 01:27:19,343
Better way to say it's we got a lot
of money riding on you to win your bet.

1025
01:27:19,610 --> 01:27:21,847
We're gonna use
our winnings to build this.

1026
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:25,294
Orville, maybe now is not the time.
Let me explain it to Mr. Fogg.

1027
01:27:25,483 --> 01:27:30,022
Just one second. Forgive my brother.
He's got his head up in the clouds.

1028
01:27:30,287 --> 01:27:34,597
He's one of these dreamers who thinks
man's gonna go swooshing around

1029
01:27:34,858 --> 01:27:37,825
on the planet
like a little hummingbird.

1030
01:27:38,029 --> 01:27:40,679
Yeah, we're all gonna fly.
He thinks so, too.

1031
01:27:40,897 --> 01:27:43,767
It's kind of sad. I'm sorry.
He's kind of a moron.

1032
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,255
He's mastered the cable steering system.
The drag-and-lift ratio.

1033
01:27:48,506 --> 01:27:50,415
- This is brilliant.
- Thank you.

1034
01:27:50,574 --> 01:27:53,443
That's what I've been saying,
but Orville doesn't listen.

1035
01:27:53,643 --> 01:27:56,458
All that stuff about mastering...
That's what I say.

1036
01:27:56,646 --> 01:28:00,388
You gotta have faith in me, no matter
how crazy big brother's dreams sound.

1037
01:28:00,617 --> 01:28:03,268
- But you told me...
- You gotta have confidence.

1038
01:28:03,453 --> 01:28:06,421
- You've got to speak up and support me.
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

1039
01:28:06,623 --> 01:28:09,012
Have you come across our friend
on your way here?

1040
01:28:10,193 --> 01:28:12,135
Who are we looking for?

1041
01:28:12,329 --> 01:28:13,376
Passepartout.

1042
01:28:14,331 --> 01:28:16,436
You mean the crazy,
half-naked Chinese guy

1043
01:28:16,633 --> 01:28:18,608
we saw running around,
where he was like...

1044
01:28:18,803 --> 01:28:21,421
- Singing "Frère Jacques"?
- With a cow skull on his head?

1045
01:28:22,073 --> 01:28:23,502
- Possibly.
- Yes.

1046
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:26,902
- He's in the back of the wagon.
- Passepartout.

1047
01:28:27,110 --> 01:28:29,532
- You are alive!
- Is that you, Grandma?

1048
01:28:33,283 --> 01:28:35,650
- Bye-bye.
- Good luck. Go win the bet.

1049
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:39,464
- No pressure, but you gotta win it.
- Bye.

1050
01:28:39,689 --> 01:28:43,519
Now, you see, to get the real
classy dames, you gotta invent stuff.

1051
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:46,182
I did.

1052
01:28:46,396 --> 01:28:48,284
"I did"? What's with the "I did"?

1053
01:28:48,465 --> 01:28:51,563
We're the Wright Brothers.
We did. Now go.

1054
01:28:51,868 --> 01:28:54,683
Hyah!

1055
01:29:00,811 --> 01:29:05,732
They're not going to make it!

1056
01:29:19,062 --> 01:29:21,910
Ah-ha-ha! New York, New York!

1057
01:29:22,132 --> 01:29:24,499
So much to see! So little time!

1058
01:29:24,669 --> 01:29:26,938
Our steamer leaves in ten minutes!

1059
01:29:27,104 --> 01:29:28,991
Go, go, go! Go, go, go!

1060
01:29:38,815 --> 01:29:41,717
- We're never going to make it.
- Phileas Fogg?

1061
01:29:45,523 --> 01:29:47,889
Autograph this for me?
It's for the wife.

1062
01:29:48,059 --> 01:29:51,953
Certainly. This business about me
robbing the Bank of England...

1063
01:29:52,228 --> 01:29:54,497
Ah, I'm from Ireland. Nice goin'.

1064
01:29:56,600 --> 01:30:01,139
The boat. Follow me.
I know a shortcut. Make a lane!

1065
01:30:06,109 --> 01:30:07,964
Make a lane!

1066
01:30:16,887 --> 01:30:18,610
Where are we?

1067
01:30:19,357 --> 01:30:21,844
- Ah!
- Whoa!

1068
01:30:22,025 --> 01:30:26,182
- That's a big man.
- It is a lady. A French lady.

1069
01:30:26,596 --> 01:30:29,891
She looks like an evil
Chinese warlord to me.

1070
01:30:41,244 --> 01:30:44,026
Your journey has caused
quite a stir, Mr. Fogg,

1071
01:30:44,215 --> 01:30:46,069
but I'm afraid it ends here.

1072
01:30:46,217 --> 01:30:48,835
Leave them alone.
This has nothing to do with them.

1073
01:30:50,221 --> 01:30:52,522
On the contrary, Lau Xing,

1074
01:30:52,689 --> 01:30:56,912
Lord Kelvin and I have made
new arrangements to conquer Lanzhou.

1075
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:59,070
Unfortunately for Mr. Fogg,

1076
01:30:59,262 --> 01:31:02,262
they entail his... permanent detour.

1077
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:04,060
I knew Kelvin was duplicitous,

1078
01:31:04,235 --> 01:31:07,049
but to align himself
with such a little scoundrel!

1079
01:31:08,272 --> 01:31:10,923
You're not a scoundrel,
but you are quite small!

1080
01:31:13,176 --> 01:31:18,392
As in petite, but most definitely lethal
and generally very scary.

1081
01:31:20,284 --> 01:31:22,739
One, two...

1082
01:31:23,653 --> 01:31:25,726
- Go!
- Three!

1083
01:31:31,361 --> 01:31:33,500
- Go up there.
- Stop them.

1084
01:31:40,071 --> 01:31:42,438
Passepartout, my cane!

1085
01:31:45,842 --> 01:31:46,955
Uh, there.

1086
01:32:10,934 --> 01:32:14,001
Passepartout!
Help! We are trapped!

1087
01:32:30,887 --> 01:32:32,414
Help!

1088
01:32:35,625 --> 01:32:38,440
Passepartout! Help!

1089
01:32:56,813 --> 01:32:58,090
There you are!

1090
01:33:01,350 --> 01:33:03,717
You have a knife in your buttock.

1091
01:33:30,815 --> 01:33:32,986
It's the evil Chinese warlord!

1092
01:33:33,149 --> 01:33:34,458
- Ooh!
- Huh?

1093
01:33:34,584 --> 01:33:36,755
She's coming!

1094
01:33:39,823 --> 01:33:41,546
The boat!

1095
01:33:41,691 --> 01:33:44,473
Up there! Hurry! Go, go, go!

1096
01:33:45,628 --> 01:33:48,279
Go, Mr. Fogg. There's not much time.

1097
01:34:07,050 --> 01:34:09,287
Wait, wait! What am I thinking?

1098
01:34:09,486 --> 01:34:11,144
Passepartout can't defeat them.

1099
01:34:11,255 --> 01:34:13,360
He's nine Tigers short.

1100
01:34:15,758 --> 01:34:20,395
Phileas, I do believe you are becoming
the man of my dreams.

1101
01:34:20,696 --> 01:34:23,118
When this is over,
let's hope the arms and legs

1102
01:34:23,333 --> 01:34:26,148
of the man of your dreams
are still attached to the torso...

1103
01:34:26,336 --> 01:34:28,224
of the man of your dreams.

1104
01:34:55,465 --> 01:34:59,491
- You have failed to stop him.
- Then your death will have to suffice.

1105
01:35:19,322 --> 01:35:20,729
Let go of me!

1106
01:35:20,857 --> 01:35:24,632
The book! It's going to fall!
How can we save...

1107
01:35:24,861 --> 01:35:26,934
- Phileas?
- I will save him...

1108
01:35:27,130 --> 01:35:29,651
Wah!

1109
01:35:38,108 --> 01:35:39,733
Mr. Fogg!

1110
01:35:52,689 --> 01:35:54,478
No!

1111
01:36:06,837 --> 01:36:08,844
Oh. Passepartout?

1112
01:36:18,916 --> 01:36:21,218
Passepartout!

1113
01:36:21,385 --> 01:36:22,563
- Huh?
- You're alive!

1114
01:36:23,687 --> 01:36:26,142
Are you injured?

1115
01:36:30,693 --> 01:36:34,206
Yes, well, uh...
Rules are made to be broken.

1116
01:36:34,465 --> 01:36:37,182
Or, uh, stabbed by a spiky shoe.

1117
01:36:37,367 --> 01:36:41,197
Mr. Fogg, you missed the ship.
You'll lose your bet.

1118
01:36:41,471 --> 01:36:44,984
Oh. At least I didn't lose a friend.

1119
01:36:55,352 --> 01:36:58,352
You must be the eleventh Tiger.

1120
01:36:58,889 --> 01:37:00,482
Meow!

1121
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:08,797
- Let's go. We must catch the next ship.
- It would never reach London in time.

1122
01:37:12,402 --> 01:37:14,769
No. No! No!

1123
01:37:14,971 --> 01:37:18,801
We are not giving up!
I almost died! You almost died!

1124
01:37:19,042 --> 01:37:22,304
We take the next ship
and win that bet!

1125
01:37:25,148 --> 01:37:27,450
Very well.

1126
01:37:27,618 --> 01:37:29,211
- Let's go.
- Yes!

1127
01:37:30,287 --> 01:37:31,880
Thank you.

1128
01:38:07,356 --> 01:38:10,226
Yes. Yes! Yes!

1129
01:38:12,029 --> 01:38:14,004
Oh, it's hopeless.

1130
01:38:14,197 --> 01:38:17,012
By those calculations,
I'm still behind by one day.

1131
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:21,935
- There must be some way!
- Phileas Fogg on my boat?

1132
01:38:23,005 --> 01:38:25,656
What an honor, sir!

1133
01:38:25,842 --> 01:38:29,454
I've quite a penny wagered on you.
The wife's none too happy about it.

1134
01:38:29,679 --> 01:38:34,316
Then again, she hasn't cracked a smile
since that shark almost devoured me.

1135
01:38:35,185 --> 01:38:37,421
Got 'em both in one bite.

1136
01:38:53,070 --> 01:38:55,688
Ah, it's Inspector Fix!

1137
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:59,385
My goodness! He made it
around the world before Fogg!

1138
01:39:00,210 --> 01:39:03,505
I came back from India
the short way, you ninny!

1139
01:39:05,314 --> 01:39:08,381
I take it you don't have
Phileas Fogg in that valise.

1140
01:39:12,922 --> 01:39:14,678
A little Jade Buddha, perhaps?

1141
01:39:28,539 --> 01:39:31,027
That's the last
of the coal, Captain.

1142
01:39:41,419 --> 01:39:43,753
Mr. Fogg.

1143
01:39:43,921 --> 01:39:46,823
I'm sorry to say,
we've burnt the last of the coal.

1144
01:39:47,024 --> 01:39:49,577
But I've had a word with the crew,

1145
01:39:49,761 --> 01:39:52,095
and all of them...

1146
01:39:52,863 --> 01:39:54,935
have agreed to burn their shoes.

1147
01:39:56,300 --> 01:39:58,471
The effort is appreciated, Captain.

1148
01:39:58,635 --> 01:40:01,450
Unfortunately,
we've gained a mere six hours.

1149
01:40:02,239 --> 01:40:06,876
- Even shoes cannot help us now.
- Must be something we can do.

1150
01:40:15,752 --> 01:40:19,014
That's it.
I've got it.

1151
01:40:20,424 --> 01:40:21,372
Birds.

1152
01:40:21,491 --> 01:40:23,880
Excellent idea! We'll burn birds!

1153
01:40:24,061 --> 01:40:26,200
No, we'll fly to London.

1154
01:40:26,396 --> 01:40:29,975
We follow the laws of physics
mastered by the birds millennia ago

1155
01:40:30,234 --> 01:40:34,009
and combine it with the Wright
Brothers' steering system.

1156
01:40:34,839 --> 01:40:37,206
Most people would laugh at you.

1157
01:40:37,374 --> 01:40:40,690
But not us. We care about you.

1158
01:40:47,985 --> 01:40:51,334
Captain, I'm afraid
I have to ask permission

1159
01:40:51,555 --> 01:40:53,976
to dismantle your ship
to build this machine.

1160
01:40:54,157 --> 01:40:56,230
Dismantle Carmen?

1161
01:40:56,394 --> 01:40:59,209
But she's me livelihood,
me most loyal companion.

1162
01:40:59,429 --> 01:41:00,607
Never, never, ever!

1163
01:41:00,765 --> 01:41:04,060
What if I could direct you
to an impeccable physician

1164
01:41:04,302 --> 01:41:07,302
who could replace both your nipples,
at my expense,

1165
01:41:07,537 --> 01:41:10,766
and I will give you enough money
to buy a brand-new ship?

1166
01:41:12,376 --> 01:41:14,896
You had me at the nipples.

1167
01:41:15,345 --> 01:41:19,306
- Cornelius, fetch me me tools! Now!
- Aye, aye, Captain!

1168
01:41:21,019 --> 01:41:22,426
One, two! One, two!

1169
01:41:28,659 --> 01:41:30,569
Timber!

1170
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:04,848
I'll go sharpen the propeller.

1171
01:42:14,638 --> 01:42:16,361
Wrong way. Not looking.

1172
01:42:52,677 --> 01:42:54,619
Just one more.

1173
01:42:54,778 --> 01:42:57,461
That's it! Right, lads, tie it off!

1174
01:42:57,647 --> 01:43:01,990
The Greenwich time zone. The last time
I shall set my watch ahead.

1175
01:43:02,420 --> 01:43:04,525
Well...

1176
01:43:04,689 --> 01:43:07,536
- Shall we fly?
- Let's.

1177
01:43:08,393 --> 01:43:12,419
Mr. Fogg. Hurrah!

1178
01:43:12,696 --> 01:43:14,638
Hurrah!

1179
01:43:16,333 --> 01:43:18,220
Inspiring words.

1180
01:43:19,369 --> 01:43:22,785
- Very well. Prepare for takeoff!
- Yes, sir!

1181
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:39,619
- Mr. Fogg, are you sure?
- No!

1182
01:43:41,491 --> 01:43:43,596
Whoa!

1183
01:43:50,735 --> 01:43:53,124
How the hell are we getting back?

1184
01:43:53,336 --> 01:43:56,086
Whoa!

1185
01:43:58,975 --> 01:44:01,244
- Now!
- Ohhh!

1186
01:44:08,151 --> 01:44:11,348
You did it, Phileas! We are flying!

1187
01:44:11,521 --> 01:44:14,172
My God! It's...

1188
01:44:15,292 --> 01:44:16,502
magical!

1189
01:44:17,228 --> 01:44:20,359
- Better than your dreams?
- Better than my dreams.

1190
01:44:20,598 --> 01:44:22,354
Hey! Don't forget to steer!

1191
01:44:43,421 --> 01:44:45,788
It's a...

1192
01:44:45,957 --> 01:44:48,062
a telegram from...

1193
01:44:48,226 --> 01:44:50,233
General Fang, sir.

1194
01:44:58,634 --> 01:45:00,522
We're going to make it!

1195
01:45:04,674 --> 01:45:06,779
- This all right?
- Oh, dear.

1196
01:45:06,943 --> 01:45:10,391
- This is exactly like a dream I had.
- You dream of winning the race?

1197
01:45:10,647 --> 01:45:15,284
- No, of crashing to my death.
- Don't worry. I'm gonna get it.

1198
01:45:18,288 --> 01:45:20,558
- Look up there!
- Great Scott!

1199
01:45:20,725 --> 01:45:22,765
Look! A flying machine!

1200
01:45:23,493 --> 01:45:26,876
- Don't step on the wing!
- It's Phileas Fogg!

1201
01:45:28,165 --> 01:45:31,361
Sir, rumor has it a flying machine
is heading for the Royal Academy,

1202
01:45:31,569 --> 01:45:33,674
our bank thief at the pedals.

1203
01:45:33,838 --> 01:45:36,391
Some people will believe anything.

1204
01:45:36,574 --> 01:45:38,995
A flying machine is
heading for the Academy!

1205
01:45:39,175 --> 01:45:43,070
- The bank thief is pedaling!
- See what I mean?

1206
01:45:43,312 --> 01:45:45,167
Help!

1207
01:45:45,315 --> 01:45:47,617
Well done, Passepartout!

1208
01:45:48,184 --> 01:45:49,678
The wing ropes!

1209
01:45:51,022 --> 01:45:55,015
Just a minor setback.
Another minor setback.

1210
01:45:56,192 --> 01:45:59,869
All right, this is a major setback.

1211
01:46:00,530 --> 01:46:02,985
A flying machine is headed
for the Royal Academy,

1212
01:46:03,199 --> 01:46:06,014
and witnesses swear
that it's Phileas Fogg.

1213
01:46:07,738 --> 01:46:11,033
Faster, Passepartout! Faster!

1214
01:46:11,242 --> 01:46:13,795
- We're losing altitude!
- Landing gear?

1215
01:46:13,977 --> 01:46:16,433
That would have been
an excellent idea!

1216
01:46:19,784 --> 01:46:21,791
The bird men are here!

1217
01:46:24,889 --> 01:46:27,791
No. I will not lose this wager!

1218
01:46:27,991 --> 01:46:32,182
He is not to reach the top step.
Get the police. Here. Now!

1219
01:46:32,429 --> 01:46:35,560
I want Fogg arrested the moment
his feet touch British soil!

1220
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:37,010
Oh!

1221
01:46:37,168 --> 01:46:39,022
- I'm sorry...
- Right in my ear!

1222
01:46:39,170 --> 01:46:42,039
Passepartout, get back in your seat.

1223
01:46:42,272 --> 01:46:45,054
We're going to return to the ground!

1224
01:46:50,848 --> 01:46:52,987
Stop! Kitchner! Hold your ground!

1225
01:46:53,783 --> 01:46:56,205
Why are they fleeing?

1226
01:46:56,386 --> 01:46:58,459
Cowards!

1227
01:47:03,226 --> 01:47:04,633
Hold on!

1228
01:47:35,525 --> 01:47:37,413
Make it to the top step!

1229
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:40,309
- New Zealand. We didn't go there.
- Top step.

1230
01:47:40,530 --> 01:47:43,530
Arrest them!
They robbed the Bank of England!

1231
01:47:44,402 --> 01:47:47,598
No, no!
Nonsense! Where is your proof?

1232
01:47:47,804 --> 01:47:50,423
This is the Royal Academy of Science!

1233
01:47:50,608 --> 01:47:53,510
We don't need to prove anything!

1234
01:47:53,710 --> 01:47:56,842
Besides which,
by the time you get out of jail,

1235
01:47:57,047 --> 01:47:59,436
you'll have lost the wager.

1236
01:48:04,488 --> 01:48:05,982
Noon.

1237
01:48:06,122 --> 01:48:07,431
We did our best.

1238
01:48:08,991 --> 01:48:12,952
Out of me way! Move it!
I used to be somebody important!

1239
01:48:13,663 --> 01:48:15,867
Should have thrown him
through a higher window.

1240
01:48:16,066 --> 01:48:18,716
- Get off!
- Get rid of this buffoon!

1241
01:48:18,903 --> 01:48:23,310
That's the thanks I get for going
halfway around the world to stop Fogg?

1242
01:48:24,640 --> 01:48:28,699
He also sent a Chinese warlord
to kill Phileas Fogg!

1243
01:48:28,945 --> 01:48:30,571
That's right. He did!

1244
01:48:32,083 --> 01:48:34,254
Lies! All of it!

1245
01:48:38,021 --> 01:48:39,101
- Kitchner!
- Yes?

1246
01:48:39,989 --> 01:48:42,607
- Tell them!
- Oh, well, yes, uh...

1247
01:48:42,792 --> 01:48:46,087
- Well, the thing of it...
- You mumbling moron!

1248
01:48:46,329 --> 01:48:48,598
Salisbury, translate Kitchner's blather.

1249
01:48:48,798 --> 01:48:51,645
I... Me... I... Yes. Yes!

1250
01:48:51,836 --> 01:48:54,770
- Rhodes!
- The thing of it is,

1251
01:48:55,538 --> 01:48:57,425
I don't want to make a fuss.

1252
01:48:57,575 --> 01:49:01,252
You spineless cretins!

1253
01:49:01,479 --> 01:49:06,083
That man stuck me with quills!
Bunches of them!

1254
01:49:06,349 --> 01:49:09,895
Yes! Lord Kelvin's a bully!

1255
01:49:10,153 --> 01:49:15,238
It's true! I hate to admit it,
but I'm a battered lord.

1256
01:49:15,493 --> 01:49:18,493
- No!
- Oh, boo-hoo!

1257
01:49:18,695 --> 01:49:21,794
So what if I did
try to kill Phileas Fogg?

1258
01:49:22,298 --> 01:49:25,494
What are you gutless peons
going to do about it?

1259
01:49:25,702 --> 01:49:29,412
I hold all the power!
I run everything!

1260
01:49:29,639 --> 01:49:34,757
So which of you half-wits
is going to stop me? You? You? You?

1261
01:49:35,045 --> 01:49:38,078
- The queen!
- The queen?

1262
01:49:38,282 --> 01:49:41,032
Oh, the queen!

1263
01:49:41,217 --> 01:49:45,178
That inbred, antiquated old cow!

1264
01:49:45,422 --> 01:49:50,244
The only way she could stop me
is if she sat on me!

1265
01:49:51,461 --> 01:49:54,909
With her big, fat royal bottom!

1266
01:49:58,735 --> 01:50:01,157
She's behind me, isn't she?

1267
01:50:01,938 --> 01:50:04,109
Oh, Your Majesty.

1268
01:50:04,275 --> 01:50:08,465
I have just apprehended the culprits
who robbed the Bank of England.

1269
01:50:08,712 --> 01:50:11,046
- No, Majesty!
- Rubbish!

1270
01:50:12,749 --> 01:50:14,659
Quiet!

1271
01:50:16,086 --> 01:50:18,453
I love being able to do that.

1272
01:50:18,621 --> 01:50:21,174
So, Lord Kelvin,

1273
01:50:21,357 --> 01:50:24,805
unsportsmanlike conduct,
attempted murder,

1274
01:50:25,027 --> 01:50:28,093
trading my arsenal for Buddhas.

1275
01:50:28,331 --> 01:50:30,720
How do you know about that?
I never said...

1276
01:50:30,934 --> 01:50:35,124
Admit it. You've been
a naughty boy, haven't you?

1277
01:50:37,674 --> 01:50:42,628
Your Majesty, I assure you,
there is an explanation for all of this.

1278
01:50:42,912 --> 01:50:45,181
What it was, was, was...

1279
01:50:45,348 --> 01:50:48,348
I was... I... I was simply...

1280
01:50:48,551 --> 01:50:50,144
simply...

1281
01:50:52,055 --> 01:50:53,779
Why do they always run?

1282
01:50:53,923 --> 01:50:55,384
Arrest him.

1283
01:50:55,525 --> 01:51:00,162
Get out of my way, you fools!
Unhand me! Don't you know who I am?

1284
01:51:01,298 --> 01:51:04,778
I'll kill you!
I'll have you for this, Fogg!

1285
01:51:05,035 --> 01:51:09,541
So, is this Phileas Fogg's
miraculous flying invention?

1286
01:51:10,406 --> 01:51:13,057
Your Majesty, we all invented it.

1287
01:51:13,243 --> 01:51:16,788
I'm very impressed,
and that doesn't happen often.

1288
01:51:17,014 --> 01:51:18,291
Thank you.

1289
01:51:18,415 --> 01:51:21,895
But still, we failed
to help Phileas win his bet.

1290
01:51:23,720 --> 01:51:27,517
- I'm sorry, Phileas.
- Don't be, my chéri.

1291
01:51:27,758 --> 01:51:31,817
I saw the world.
I learnt of new cultures.

1292
01:51:32,061 --> 01:51:34,297
I flew across an ocean.

1293
01:51:34,497 --> 01:51:36,090
I wore women's clothing.

1294
01:51:37,066 --> 01:51:39,237
Oh?

1295
01:51:40,337 --> 01:51:42,671
Made a friend.

1296
01:51:44,207 --> 01:51:46,760
Fell in love.

1297
01:51:46,943 --> 01:51:50,107
- Who cares if I lost a wager?
- I do.

1298
01:51:50,313 --> 01:51:55,943
- I've got 20 quid riding on you.
- Your Majesty, it has gone 12 noon.

1299
01:51:56,252 --> 01:51:59,667
Correct. Which gives you
24 hours remaining.

1300
01:52:00,557 --> 01:52:03,306
- Could we have miscounted?
- No.

1301
01:52:03,493 --> 01:52:07,235
I moved Mr. Fogg's watch ahead one hour
as we passed each time zone.

1302
01:52:08,799 --> 01:52:11,188
The international date line.

1303
01:52:11,401 --> 01:52:14,249
We set our watches forward
at 20 more time zones, so...

1304
01:52:14,470 --> 01:52:17,339
here it's still day 79.

1305
01:52:17,541 --> 01:52:20,094
- So, we've...
- We've won!

1306
01:52:27,317 --> 01:52:28,779
We won, we won...

1307
01:52:28,918 --> 01:52:31,438
Thank God. Ah!

1308
01:52:35,959 --> 01:52:38,894
Your Majesty, I...
I apologize. Do forgive me.

1309
01:52:39,095 --> 01:52:43,023
- I quite forgot myself.
- Go and win your bet, Mr. Fogg.

1310
01:52:43,299 --> 01:52:46,234
I shall need a new minister of science.

1311
01:52:48,838 --> 01:52:52,548
Uh, yes, of course, Your Majesty.

1312
01:52:55,045 --> 01:52:57,314
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

1313
01:52:58,448 --> 01:53:01,863
Go!

1314
01:53:07,157 --> 01:53:09,044
- We won, Phileas! We won!
- Yes!

1315
01:53:09,226 --> 01:53:10,819
We won!

1316
01:53:13,329 --> 01:53:15,271
Oh, well done!

1317
01:53:22,272 --> 01:53:23,482
Go ahead.

1318
