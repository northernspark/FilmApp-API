{5620}{5668}We should get this repaired.
{5900}{5952}I'm going to bed. Good night.
{6003}{6036}I'll be up soon.
{6058}{6112}Now, it gives me great pleasure|to welcome...
{6115}{6199}our new deputy superintendent,|Dr. Max Raphael.
{6251}{6346}And we also welcome his wife, Stella,|and their fine young fellow, Charlie.
{6387}{6492}And we wish you many contented years|here, among the confined and confused.
{6514}{6600}I refer, of course, to the present|company, not to the patients.
{6846}{6882}Please forgive the latecomer.
{6884}{6944}A rather delicate moment|with our new matricide.
{6946}{7028}- Did I miss anything?|- Only Jack's speech. Perfect timing.
{7030}{7109}Peter, I'd like to introduce you|to Mrs. Raphael.
{7112}{7171}Yes, of course. I'm so sorry.|Peter Cleave.
{7174}{7228}- How do you do?|- Stella Raphael.
{7232}{7300}Peter is our longest-serving doctor here.
{7303}{7351}I'm fixtures and fittings.
{7362}{7411}Forgive me. I need that sausage.
{7414}{7440}Excuse me.
{7460}{7535}- What's your field, Dr. Cleave?|- Peter, please.
{7594}{7653}I tend to deal with the extreme cases.
{7696}{7735}My particular interest...
{7737}{7815}is sexual pathology|and its associated catastrophes.
{7843}{7930}- And what does your wife make of that?|- She doesn't. I'm not.
{7942}{8014}I spend my life|immersed in the passions of others.
{8016}{8097}Dangerous sport, love.|I'm not sure I have the stomach for it.
{8109}{8140}I've been married for 12 years.
{8143}{8196}I'm not sure|I've ever thought of it as a sport.
{8199}{8252}Well, marriage|is a different beast entirely.
{8255}{8300}I'm talking about passion.
{8369}{8428}What did Cleave|have to say for himself?
{8430}{8495}This and that. I rather liked him.
{8509}{8545}Trust me, he's got fangs.
{8548}{8599}- Who has?|- Count Dracula.
{8631}{8659}He wanted my job.
{8662}{8720}Thought he deserved it|for his years of loyalty.
{8737}{8810}Why didn't you speak|to any of the other wives?
{8840}{8879}There wasn't time.
{8895}{8957}But I'm so looking forward|to our coffee mornings.
{8960}{9039}You will involve yourself|in the life of the hospital.
{9041}{9108}- It's expected.|- Of course.
{9132}{9207}Now, the band. I thought last year's|was splendid. Agreed?
{9210}{9271}Yes, but can we have|some slower numbers this time?
{9273}{9335}I've only just recovered.|It was exhausting.
{9357}{9442}Rebook the band, subject to slowies.|Show of hands.
{9502}{9531}Carried.
{9537}{9594}Next, do I have any takers for the cake?
{9632}{9704}Stella, would you like to commandeer|the fruitcake?
{9707}{9759}- I'd be honored.|- Lovely.
{9761}{9834}And if you'll forgive the reminder,|no liqueur.
{9842}{9875}Alcohol, dear.
{9877}{9936}Alcohol for the patients, verboten.
{11399}{11471}Help me! Help me!
{11493}{11588}Help me! Help me! Help! Help me!
{12035}{12075}Are you joining us?
{12105}{12143}No, I'm not. No.
{12145}{12183}- It's this way.|- No.
{12208}{12272}But you're not allowed in the corridor!
{12279}{12310}Come back!
{12327}{12384}You're going the wrong way!
{12422}{12457}- I'm so sorry.|- No bother.
{12698}{12729}Thank you.
{12780}{12832}I don't mean to nanny,|but it might be wise...
{12835}{12911}to restrict yourself|to the public areas of the hospital.
{12914}{12978}One never quite knows|what one might find.
{13014}{13070}Do the male and female patients|ever mix?
{13072}{13144}Yes, of course.|At the annual hospital ball.
{13147}{13207}A perfect opportunity to mingle.
{13228}{13285}Believe me, once a year is ample.
{13316}{13368}- Can I give you a hand, Mrs. Bain?|- No.
{13381}{13428}Thank you, Mrs. Raphael.
{13608}{13671}How did my predecessor fill her days?
{13679}{13740}She sewed. Tapestry.
{13759}{13836}One year, she did all the hospital,|seen from above.
{13999}{14040}Mommy! Come and see!
{14048}{14100}- What, darling?|- Come and see!
{14284}{14332}Edgar, this is my mother.
{14358}{14433}We've invented a test of strength.|Will you time us?
{14448}{14499}I don't have my watch on, darling.
{14502}{14534}Just count then.
{14576}{14619}Ready and lift.
{14636}{14662}Go.
{14664}{14775}1, 2, 3, 4, 5...
{14784}{14893}6, 7, 8, 9, 10...
{14912}{14984}11, 12, 13...
{14986}{15046}14, 15, 16...
{15048}{15083}Put him down.
{15110}{15183}Sorry. I didn't see you there,|Mrs. Raphael.
{15216}{15252}Come on, Charlie.
{15392}{15432}Thank you, Mrs. Bain.
{15662}{15743}Charlie's made a new friend,|that man doing the glasshouse.
{15745}{15801}- Oh, good.|- Is he safe?
{15829}{15878}He wouldn't be in our garden|if he wasn't.
{15880}{15931}Working is a privilege.|It can take years to earn it.
{15933}{15982}They've all been fully vetted.
{15988}{16075}- Is he one of yours?|- No, Cleave's. His favorite, I think.
{16098}{16175}- Favorite?|- It's not unusual to have a pet patient.
{16188}{16220}Who's yours?
{16277}{16303}You.
{16412}{16470}Why is Peter Cleave so taken with him?
{16472}{16530}You know him,|fancies himself an aesthete...
{16532}{16592}and the fellow used to be a sculptor.
{16601}{16637}What did he do?
{16676}{16712}Heads, I think.
{16727}{16765}- No, I meant...|- I know what you meant.
{16768}{16844}I interviewed him myself.|Charlie is perfectly safe.
{17076}{17103}Hello.
{17125}{17199}I'm sorry about the other day.|I hope you didn't get into trouble.
{17202}{17267}No more than I'm in already,|Mrs. Raphael.
{17823}{17887}My husband tells me|you were a sculptor.
{17899}{17934}I still am.
{17957}{18030}- May I ask how long you've been here?|- You may.
{18055}{18080}And?
{18122}{18153}Six years.
{18270}{18308}I killed my wife.
{18356}{18393}She betrayed me.
{18939}{18973}Mrs. Raphael.
{19016}{19063}What have you done to him?
{19088}{19122}Mrs. Raphael!
{19178}{19233}He was climbing a tree. He fell.
{19478}{19523}Can Edgar stay for tea?
{19572}{19667}- I'm afraid he can't. He...|- I've got to get back to work, Charlie.
{19754}{19782}Thanks.
{20116}{20147}How is he?
{20160}{20202}He's fine, thank you.
{20265}{20334}I don't think|he'll be climbing any trees just yet.
{20336}{20404}I don't know. Not my position...
{20425}{20476}but I reckon he's an adventurer.
{20490}{20531}You might be right.
{20551}{20606}I suppose he gets that from you.
{20657}{20689}I doubt it.
{20715}{20767}It must be your husband then.
{20913}{20952}Interesting dress.
{20982}{21054}- Is that a compliment?|- Yes.
{21090}{21171}Might it be a touch too revealing,|given the occasion?
{21181}{21238}I'll mention it to my dressmaker.
{21271}{21307}What a good idea.
{21541}{21576}United front.
{23500}{23548}May I have the pleasure?
{25350}{25430}- Can you keep a secret?|- Depends what it is.
{25448}{25504}Jack told me|he's planning to retire next year.
{25508}{25581}I wonder who he's recommending|as his successor.
{25602}{25667}- Would it be someone I know?|- It would.
{25686}{25757}- Is it Peter Cleave?|- Very droll.
{25788}{25865}Congratulations. That's wonderful news.
{25936}{25997}It'll be a huge commitment|for both of us.
{26004}{26091}I know it's not exactly ideal here|for you and Charlie, but it'll change.
{26100}{26160}We'll have that house and a garden.
{26169}{26215}We'll be able to settle.
{26459}{26511}Thank you for dancing with me.
{26619}{26658}I can't take those.
{26838}{26889}You could take what they mean.
{27024}{27073}- Hello, Mr. Archer.|- Edgar.
{27539}{27570}Break over!
{33659}{33715}How are you finding Mrs. Raphael?
{33722}{33772}I don't have much to do with her.
{33775}{33818}I'm busy with my work.
{33820}{33926}But Mr. Archer tells me|of your recent interest in horticulture.
{33937}{34027}She's kind to me. I gave her|some flowers a few weeks ago.
{34034}{34080}And you danced with her.
{34101}{34175}Only to show you|I can behave myself with a woman.
{34187}{34219}I don't doubt it.
{34221}{34312}- You're pleased with my progress?|- I'm not here to judge you.
{34343}{34417}But, yes,|you're progressing as one would want.
{34436}{34487}And, in time...
{34512}{34572}work duties lead to my release?
{34586}{34628}Have patience, Edgar.
{34652}{34712}We still have many mountains to climb.
{34750}{34801}I've always done|everything you've asked.
{34804}{34886}Indeed, but that does not make you|ready for the world.
{34891}{34974}- But you've cured me.|- Of what exactly?
{34996}{35049}Severe personality disorder...
{35074}{35130}with features of morbid jealousy.
{35194}{35310}Continue with your work,|and we'll continue to take a view.
{36068}{36110}Any news on the job?
{36131}{36181}You'll be the first to know.
{36224}{36274}Stella behaving herself?
{36295}{36327}Yes, Mother.
{36386}{36442}That fellow's done wonders|with your glasshouse.
{36444}{36490}Yes, it's scrubbed up rather well,|hasn't it?
{36492}{36575}Our rockery resembles Berlin in '45.
{36608}{36644}Perhaps you could pass him over to us.
{36647}{36713}I don't know if it's my imagination,|but isn't he rather attractive?
{36716}{36757}- It's your imagination.|- He is attractive.
{36760}{36850}- Did he do something rather nasty?|- He murdered his wife.
{36868}{36936}Obviously sane.|Can't think why we got him.
{36963}{37000}What will happen to him?
{37003}{37066}I have no idea.|That's Peter's department.
{37068}{37170}I suspect he will be overhauling|rockeries for a good few years to come.
{37190}{37270}Here's to locking the door|and throwing away the key.
{37351}{37428}What the hell is wrong with you?|You had no right to say that.
{37431}{37508}The way he casually dismissed that|man's whole future, it was sickening.
{37511}{37560}Policy is not your concern.
{37577}{37678}- I thought the policy was to reform.|- It's none of your bloody business!
{37680}{37758}- Is it really so difficult to behave?|- Like the other wives?
{37760}{37842}- Like the other little ladies?|- Frankly, yes.
{37952}{38007}- Bye, Mrs. Bain.|- Behave yourself, Charlie.
{38366}{38411}Here, let me show you.
{38953}{38983}Not here.
{39611}{39643}Oh, no!
{40356}{40425}- I just had a bath.|- Your point being?
{40700}{40750}- I forgot my checkbook.|- Oh.
{40771}{40850}- Where did you last see it?|- Well, I don't know, do I?
{41240}{41271}Here it is.
{41336}{41380}Here we go, young man.
{41396}{41466}Let's go to the zoo.|Shall we do that first?
{41468}{41540}And then we can go|into the shop we went to...
{42342}{42381}Are you all right?
{42415}{42459}Have you seen a ghost?
{42534}{42583}What's the matter, darling?
{42612}{42654}There was a patient.
{42661}{42737}- What patient? Where?|- In the house.
{42759}{42818}He might've been in Mommy's bedroom.
{42907}{42957}Who was he? Do you know him?
{43702}{43754}Can I use the phone, please?
{43766}{43812}Is everything all right?
{44201}{44313}It's been suggested|that your dealings with Edgar Stark...
{44316}{44376}went beyond propriety.
{44380}{44439}- Suggested by who?|- John Archer.
{44472}{44539}And there have been whispers|among the patients.
{44542}{44575}These rumors soon get back to me.
{44578}{44632}Naturally, I give them no credence...
{44635}{44705}but I do need to know|why they might have arisen.
{44713}{44767}Stella talked to Stark in the garden.
{44769}{44836}She talks to many of the patients.|What of it?
{44872}{44900}Stella?
{44934}{45027}Well, Charlie was fond of him so|of course I spoke to him occasionally.
{45030}{45107}- You danced with him at the ball.|- I danced with you, too.
{45588}{45630}I'm afraid it's true.
{45642}{45671}My God!
{45691}{45747}- Does Max know?|- I suspect so.
{45758}{45806}It's a bloody catastrophe!
{45814}{45896}The Home Office will be apoplectic,|and in my last year.
{45899}{45985}- Doubtless they'll require a head to roll.|- Well, they're not having mine!
{46003}{46052}Did you never think|the man might try to escape?
{46055}{46131}Of course not.|Otherwise, I would have prevented it.
{46161}{46247}Well, you were right about Max.|He's not for us.
{46274}{46331}Appalling, bloody stupid woman!
{46334}{46412}She practically chauffeured the man|out of the door!
{46446}{46530}As for the wife, never in 40 years.
{46553}{46606}He obviously has no control over her.
{46608}{46674}Who will be her next prey,|for God's sake?
{46724}{46755}He'll have to go.
{46757}{46846}May I suggest that we don't toss|that particular bone to the press?
{46848}{46887}At least, not yet.
{46912}{47022}We'll be crucified in the papers as it is.|They love a madman on the loose.
{47036}{47129}We must preserve the integrity|of the hospital for the future.
{47244}{47288}Peter, when the Inspector arrives...
{47291}{47348}do you think we can play down|the more lurid aspects...
{47351}{47407}of Stark's recent activities?
{47423}{47458}Naturally.
{47500}{47566}Do you think Stella|helped him to escape?
{47597}{47661}Not particularly. She was manipulated.
{47705}{47768}I suspect she's fallen in love with him.
{47828}{47863}You're fixated.
{47866}{47943}That's why you passed him fit for work|when you knew he was unstable.
{47945}{48022}Drivel. Your wife destabilized him.
{48024}{48108}One could hardly have predicted|that element in the equation.
{48151}{48246}I assume you're acting as Jack's|factotum sent to extract my resignation?
{48249}{48346}Spare us the grandiosity. Just get on|with your work and keep quiet.
{48358}{48420}I might remind you|that I'm your superior.
{48423}{48456}In what sense?
{48812}{48840}How long?
{48864}{48939}- You're supposed to time me.|- I'm sorry, darling.
{48984}{49049}If they catch him, will he be in trouble?
{49105}{49192}I don't think they will catch him.|He's been gone too long.
{49195}{49271}I think he's on a boat|sailing back to Australia.
{49747}{49811}I think you should come and talk to me.
{49849}{49897}Unofficially, of course.
{49960}{49997}Let me help you.
{50824}{50923}I might go up to town tomorrow|and do some early Christmas shopping.
{50936}{51003}- Something for me?|- Wait and see.
{52092}{52152}I'm Nick. It was me on the phone.
{52170}{52214}Why were you so late?
{52239}{52298}Had to be sure you weren't followed.
{52345}{52387}How do you know him?
{52404}{52451}I was his assistant...
{52480}{52507}before.
{54234}{54289}Did you think I'd abandoned you?
{54337}{54402}I couldn't contact you till it was safe.
{54459}{54498}And it's safe now?
{54987}{55039}- How was London?|- Busy.
{55075}{55150}I saw something for you,|but they didn't have your size.
{55152}{55215}I have to go and collect it next week.
{55934}{55970}Successful trip?
{56036}{56093}You find what you were after?
{56106}{56142}Yes. Finally.
{56178}{56211}Where is it?
{56282}{56316}Your shopping.
{56321}{56367}The shopping you did in London.|Where is it?
{56370}{56433}- It's for Christmas. I've hidden it.|- Where?
{56448}{56524}- If I told you, it wouldn't be hidden.|- Show me what you bought.
{56552}{56591}Show me! Damn you!
{56817}{56854}Happy Christmas.
{57279}{57311}Forgive me.
{58343}{58380}Does he suspect?
{58422}{58468}He's buried in his work.
{58486}{58527}Do you share a bed?
{58715}{58746}I'm yours.
{58855}{58901}So don't go back to him.
{58913}{58954}Come and live with me.
{58984}{59036}I can't just leave my family.
{59054}{59088}Yes, you can.
{59146}{59201}Give them up or don't come back.
{59268}{59352}Once you're here,|we'll find a way to bring Charlie, too.
{59392}{59419}Please.
{59453}{59492}I can't share you.
{59712}{59740}Decide.
{59923}{59957}How is Edgar?
{60002}{60038}What on earth do you mean?
{60040}{60134}Your housekeeper let slip|you're taking regular trips to London.
{60142}{60199}You're seeing him, aren't you?
{60261}{60351}If you knew women, you'd know|they like to shop occasionally.
{60538}{60627}Don't delude yourself|you're in love with a tortured genius.
{60660}{60699}He's a failed artist...
{60701}{60781}infinitely more dangerous|both to you and himself.
{60813}{60871}He's mine, and he needs my help.
{60912}{60958}Evidently, he disagrees.
{61048}{61107}You should know|what he did to his wife.
{61125}{61183}I don't need to know.|I have nothing to do with the man.
{61185}{61270}He beat her to death with a hammer|and then decapitated her.
{61297}{61346}He took a scalpel and cut out her eyes...
{61349}{61434}and then he hacked at her face|as if it were clay.
{61497}{61554}Perhaps there won't be|any more trips to London.
{61556}{61623}Perhaps your mental state is too fragile.
{61665}{61735}With Max's consent,|we can hold you here.
{61772}{61826}- Nonsense.|- But we can.
{61937}{61991}For your own safety, of course.
{62032}{62062}Stella...
{62084}{62126}tell me where he is.
{62766}{62851}Mrs. B, how do you spell amoeba?
{62864}{62913}With a dictionary, my dear.
{62924}{63013}Don't ask me.|I've got the brain of an amoeba.
{63856}{63881}She's...
{63928}{63971}She's having a little holiday.
{64009}{64067}I'm sure she'll be back very soon.
{64239}{64280}Shall I read to you?
{64404}{64451}Has she gone to Australia?
{64674}{64724}"That was Tom's great secret...
{64727}{64786}"the scheme to return home|with his brother pirates...
{64789}{64847}"and attend their own funerals.
{64852}{64937}"They had paddled over to the Missouri|shore on a log, at dusk on Saturday."
{65370}{65411}Can I move, please?
{65493}{65540}I've got pins and needles.
{65614}{65691}She taught me lots of things.|She's a black Caribbean.
{65699}{65780}Have you had a black woman?|No, you haven't. I have.
{65831}{65890}I was very drunk, but you know...
{65911}{65999}I couldn't quite do the samba.|She taught me a lot of things.
{66152}{66185}Take it off.
{66406}{66439}I'm working!
{66598}{66670}- I'm going for a walk, all right?|- Be careful.
{67552}{67583}Thank you.
{67812}{67861}- Are you following me?|- No.
{67880}{67952}What? You just like hanging around|in markets?
{68090}{68149}Have you any reason not to trust me?
{68152}{68214}- So why have me followed?|- It won't happen again. Sorry.
{68216}{68283}- Why don't you trust me?|- I said I'm sorry.
{68449}{68476}I'm working.
{68479}{68553}You're always working.|It's just like being with my husband.
{68580}{68631}- Is it?|- Yes.
{68634}{68699}- Like being with your husband, is it?|- Yes.
{68701}{68738}- Just like home?|- Yes.
{68740}{68824}- Is this what he was like?|- Yes.
{68873}{68904}Like this?
{68988}{69070}- Hooray! Look at that.|- Wonderful.
{69267}{69332}- Tell me.|- I miss Charlie.
{69403}{69482}It's all right. Don't be sad.
{70268}{70299}I love you.
{70302}{70352}It doesn't matter, but I do.
{70380}{70453}- No, you don't.|- I do.
{70526}{70563}I love him, too.
{70624}{70699}- Happy Christmas, Stella.|- Thank you.
{70848}{70916}You touch her again, I'll fucking kill you!
{71463}{71502}Please stay, Nick.
{71518}{71589}I'm gonna clear out my stuff|before he gets back.
{71638}{71680}There's no point in arguing.
{71781}{71827}It's not my place, but...
{71878}{71931}Maybe you should come with me.
{72013}{72073}He's turning. I've seen it before.
{72123}{72158}With his wife?
{72189}{72225}I saw the body.
{72263}{72308}Please don't stay here.
{72790}{72841}I thought you'd been caught.
{72852}{72930}- Is that what you want?|- No, of course not.
{72973}{73032}- Are you missing your comforts?|- No.
{73058}{73103}You were going to Nick.
{73225}{73287}Are you going to start hitting me now?
{73982}{74014}I love you.
{74085}{74116}I love you.
{75118}{75209}He needs help. Can you find a doctor?
{75231}{75277}I'll see what I can do.
{75852}{75922}- I saw you together. You're fucking him.|- No.
{77006}{77030}Eat.
{77075}{77170}When my wife took her lovers,|she tried to poison me.
{77219}{77244}Eat.
{78266}{78318}You've checked those clothes?
{78665}{78699}Mrs. Raphael.
{79225}{79253}Let's go.
{79832}{79889}You'll be released in the morning.
{79994}{80036}Could I see Charlie?
{80138}{80244}You're aware I could prevent you from|having any further contact with him.
{80286}{80324}But he needs you.
{80383}{80430}You'll see him tomorrow.
{80515}{80547}Thank you.
{80863}{80921}Mr. Raphael, this way please, sir.
{80982}{81029}Mr. Raphael,|do you have any comments?
{82145}{82226}There's a blanket in the back|if you want to sleep. It's a long journey.
{82229}{82280}- Where are we going?|- Wales.
{82302}{82353}- What?|- Wales.
{82380}{82413}North Wales.
{82437}{82517}Sheep, tractors,|and a genetic hatred of the English.
{82563}{82630}Once it got in the papers,|I was dismissed.
{82646}{82719}I managed to get a position|at a local hospital.
{82737}{82801}- Jack fired you?|- No.
{82842}{82877}His successor.
{84961}{84993}You asleep?
{85150}{85191}Are you better now?
{85226}{85306}I'll never go away again. I promise.
{85367}{85410}I'm very, very sorry.
{85714}{85770}Thank you for letting me see him.
{85784}{85846}A stronger man would have let you rot.
{85861}{85935}- You're strong.|- Don't be trite.
{85963}{86022}I wasn't strong enough to keep you.
{86195}{86260}- Good night.|- Good night.
{86693}{86734}A little word of advice.
{86737}{86810}Don't let your shame|degenerate into self-pity.
{86828}{86865}It seldom helps.
{87142}{87185}Settled in all right?
{87233}{87271}Walking, are you?
{87415}{87444}Charlie.
{87586}{87611}Mom!
{87614}{87637}Good morning, sir.
{87707}{87778}Come on.|Good morning, Charlie. You all right?
{88225}{88271}We can't live like this.
{88296}{88341}Please come back to us.
{88414}{88442}Please.
{88739}{88764}Excuse me.
{89002}{89029}Hello?
{89046}{89112}Speak up, will you?|This line's atrocious.
{89121}{89171}Yes.
{89174}{89222}{y:i}- Could you tell me where?|- Yes, Wales.
{89225}{89257}{y:i}Do you have an address?
{89260}{89330}Well, I don't have an address.|Only the hospital. Cledwyn General.
{89333}{89384}{y:i}- Could you repeat that, please?|- Cledwyn.
{89422}{89474}Well, I have no idea. Ask a policeman.
{89477}{89509}Claudia, who is it?
{89512}{89582}An old colleague of Dr. Raphael's.|He's a mumbler.
{89585}{89621}- May I?|- Please.
{89681}{89713}Who is this?
{89763}{89790}Hello?
{89849}{89876}Edgar?
{90002}{90084}{y:i}- Are you expecting the police?|- Yes, they're here already.
{90130}{90218}{y:i}- If he comes for her?|- I wouldn't like to say what he'd do.
{90271}{90322}{y:i}You put her on medication, I assume?
{90330}{90366}She doesn't need it.
{90410}{90442}She's fine.
{90474}{90557}- Goodbye, Mr. Griffin. See you.|- Goodbye.
{90574}{90646}- Bye.|- Bye, darling. Goodbye.
{90670}{90703}Bye, Elaine.
{90717}{90761}- Bye, Charlie.|- Bye, Mr. Griffin.
{90764}{90802}See you tomorrow.
{90985}{91046}There's a school field trip next week.
{91055}{91105}Are parents allowed to come?
{91402}{91459}If you need me, I'll be upstairs.
{91466}{91518}I've just got to finish something.
{92066}{92089}Here.
{92530}{92579}Parents are allowed on the field trip.
{92582}{92617}I told a lie.
{92745}{92801}Well, everyone lies occasionally.
{92833}{92868}Good for telling me.
{93007}{93057}Would you like some company?
{93125}{93189}Well, I don't think I'm busy next week.
{93911}{93958}I know you long for him.
{94011}{94083}But you won't see him again.|You know that, don't you?
{94098}{94122}Yes.
{94182}{94244}We'll be a family again, like before.
{94291}{94351}In time, this will be what you want.
{95085}{95154}Hurry, darling,|we mustn't keep Daddy waiting.
{95414}{95442}Hello?
{95686}{95736}- Where's Mommy?|- Phone rang.
{95986}{96013}Sorry.
{96065}{96124}- Who was it?|- Mr. Griffin.
{96143}{96198}Instructions for our field trip.
{96347}{96397}- Inspector.|- Good morning, Dr. Raphael.
{96400}{96439}It's good of you to help out.
{97491}{97521}You came.
{97754}{97784}Let's go.
{97861}{97911}I can't leave Charlie again.
{97930}{97965}I promised him.
{97993}{98042}I'll never stop loving you.
{98068}{98115}- Where is he?|- At school.
{98134}{98198}We'll go and get him. Take him with us.
{98792}{98816}No!
{99690}{99721}He's gone.
{99768}{99810}Now let him go!
{99962}{100067}{y:i}Six green bottles hanging on the wall
{100078}{100176}{y:i}Six green bottles hanging on the wall
{100178}{100288}{y:i}And if one green bottle|should accidentally fall
{100290}{100404}{y:i}There'll be five green bottles|hanging on the wall
{100414}{100513}{y:i}Five green bottles hanging on the wall
{100516}{100547}{y:i}Five green
{100706}{100767}If I can have your attention, please.
{100774}{100857}Children, don't forget to collect items|of interest in your jam jars.
{100860}{100910}Now, if you could form yourselves|into groups.
{100913}{100963}Please, at least one adult in each.
{100982}{101014}Here we go.
{101023}{101100}Okay, one, two, there we go.|Thanks, Mrs. Jones.
{101102}{101137}There we are.
{101172}{101243}There we are, Mrs. Raphael.|Well done, Charlie.
{101440}{101488}I'm going to catch a fish.
{101522}{101564}Won't you need a rod?
{101568}{101637}I'm hoping a small one|will swim into my jar.
{101667}{101756}Do you know fish can only|remember things for eight seconds?
{103695}{103729}Mrs. Raphael!
{103760}{103810}Mrs. Raphael, do something!
{103866}{103901}Do something!
{105337}{105372}Thank you so much.
{105441}{105488}Such difficult circumstances.
{106226}{106281}Excuse me.
{106334}{106355}Jack.
{106394}{106417}Jack...
{106452}{106507}you must come and visit me soon.
{106526}{106565}Maybe next summer.
{106593}{106652}It's so kind of you to deal with all this.|Poor Max.
{106655}{106697}The least I could do.
{106752}{106804}Max is in complete agreement.
{106817}{106884}Of course, I had to arrange things|with the Home Office.
{106886}{106957}It was a little bit sticky, but we got there.
{106988}{107070}Well, arranging things is your forte,|isn't it, Peter?
{107104}{107142}Goodbye, my dear.
{107289}{107354}Well, shall I keep you informed?
{107390}{107432}I don't want to know.
{107454}{107485}Oh, my dear.
{107528}{107609}Peter, I just wanted|to thank you for so many things.
{107612}{107677}So sorry, dear Max.
{108280}{108360}I want you to understand|what's going to happen next.
{108380}{108428}The shock will wear off...
{108431}{108501}and it will be replaced|by a devastating grief.
{108515}{108590}In time, you'll come to terms|with what you've done...
{108593}{108644}and you'll just be very, very sad.
{108672}{108744}And that sadness will stay with you...
{108768}{108816}for the rest of your life.
{109684}{109735}- Good evening.|- Good evening.
{110260}{110292}Come now.
{110561}{110592}Good girl.
{110662}{110699}Where's Charlie?
{110724}{110816}- Where's my picture of Charlie?|- With your belongings.
{110847}{110897}- You mean, I can't see him?|- Not yet.
{110946}{111001}Because I killed him, didn't I?
{111140}{111166}Come here.
{112206}{112244}Is Edgar here?
{112272}{112308}Of course not.
{112349}{112381}Where is he?
{112421}{112485}The past, Stella.
{112525}{112564}He's in the past.
{113102}{113138}Good afternoon.
{113257}{113319}If you won't speak, I can't treat you.
{113383}{113444}Do you want to stay in solitary forever?
{113503}{113565}Talk. Say something!
{113651}{113694}Express your contempt.
{113994}{114025}She's here.
{114067}{114124}She's been here six weeks.
{114162}{114200}She's my patient.
{114289}{114313}Why?
{114435}{114476}Something terrible.
{114596}{114633}The boy drowned.
{114694}{114758}Yes, you were fond of him.
{114862}{114909}Would you like to see her?
{114989}{115016}Speak.
{115588}{115612}Thank you.
{115657}{115698}Did you do as I asked?
{115701}{115774}To think rigorously|about what it means to love?
{115819}{115897}I'm beginning to understand|that it was never real.
{115922}{115973}That it was all an obsession.
{116031}{116093}Can you define your feelings for him?
{116178}{116210}I have none.
{116246}{116309}It's over. It ended when Charlie died.
{116334}{116406}If I told you he was here,|in the hospital?
{116466}{116538}Well, I suppose it would be logical|if he were.
{116651}{116704}The question was hypothetical.
{117006}{117070}You've been very brave|these past weeks.
{117084}{117122}Thank you, Peter.
{117918}{117976}I see you've got a flat tire.
{118056}{118097}I don't need a car.
{118150}{118209}- Not for work?|- I've resigned.
{118258}{118335}I think I might go into teaching. I'm...
{118366}{118428}- I might be quite good with children.|- Yes.
{118461}{118492}Good idea.
{118529}{118576}What do you want from me?
{118693}{118718}Come.
{118770}{118825}Welcome. Thank you, nurse.
{118903}{118983}Would you like a drink?|I usually have one about now.
{119022}{119064}- I'd love one.|- Yes.
{119113}{119144}The usual?
{119162}{119210}Your old usual, should I say?
{119384}{119420}Your health.
{119506}{119544}Yesterday, I went to see Max.
{119547}{119616}I made a suggestion|with which he concurred.
{119654}{119728}My contacts at the Home Office|might well release you from here...
{119731}{119829}were I to guarantee|your continued treatment and safety.
{119916}{119968}What I mean to say is that...
{119980}{120051}were you to live with me, in my house...
{120066}{120150}these conditions|would most likely be satisfied.
{120206}{120277}I can offer you a fine home|and a decent life...
{120290}{120384}traveling, art, gardening, and so on.
{120406}{120478}But I'm still married to Max.
{120503}{120549}He wants to divorce you.
{120746}{120793}You're a very dark horse.
{120810}{120897}Well, I assure you this is not|my usual procedure with patients.
{120903}{120964}It's something|that rather crept up on me.
{121011}{121094}It would be arrogant to suggest|that you might love me.
{121136}{121191}But I believe you need me at present...
{121194}{121293}and perhaps, in time, this need|might grow into love of some variety.
{121378}{121433}Are you a passionate man, Peter?
{121503}{121593}I think that's something|we'd have to discover.
{121638}{121717}What would she want|with an old queen like you?
{121735}{121778}We have dialogue.
{121781}{121865}I'm disappointed.|I thought you wanted me.
{121890}{121958}You resent it, don't you?
{121993}{122064}That she might find happiness|with someone else?
{122276}{122344}I wondered if you might like this.
{122416}{122448}Oh, Peter.
{122478}{122527}Thank you. It's beautiful.
{122558}{122599}It was my mother's.
{122826}{122856}Shall we?
{122998}{123023}Here.
{123146}{123215}The ladies were discussing|the hospital ball.
{123259}{123306}Would you like to attend?
{123370}{123405}I'm not sure.
{123427}{123520}Well, it might be difficult for you.|Memories and so on.
{123594}{123674}- You'll be there?|- Well, of course. Yes, that's true.
{123814}{123855}Will Edgar be there?
{123981}{124058}If we're to be married, Peter,|let's not have lies.
{124231}{124273}You knew he was here?
{124312}{124366}I heard talk, and I know you.
{124390}{124448}You wouldn't give up on a patient.
{124460}{124553}I thought it might be traumatic for you.|I would have told you in time.
{124589}{124670}- Forgive me.|- Of course.
{124827}{124874}And to answer your question...
{124904}{124946}he'll be at the dance.
{124950}{124991}Unless you wish otherwise.
{125023}{125072}Whatever you think is best.
{125238}{125340}It might be useful for his recovery|to see you've moved on, as it were.
{125423}{125461}You'll fail her.
{125484}{125513}He did.
{125529}{125556}I did.
{125567}{125598}So will you.
{125601}{125673}Perspective. We can work with that.
{125690}{125718}Cleave...
{125802}{125849}will you let me see her?
{125883}{125912}Please.
{126056}{126122}The hospital ball|might be an opportunity.
{126186}{126232}Cooperate in your treatment...
{126260}{126296}and we'll see.
{127205}{127248}You look magnificent.
{127346}{127401}You look very dashing yourself.
{127461}{127505}I remember that dress.
{127533}{127581}I'm amazed it still fits.
{127664}{127745}- Will you dance with me later?|- That would be lovely.
{129994}{130054}Stella, shall we?
{130276}{130359}By the way, I went to fetch Edgar,|and he was asleep.
{130361}{130411}I woke him and he said|that he'd changed his mind...
{130413}{130459}and didn't want to come.
{133607}{133688}Leave me alone.
