0:05:43:He descended to the dead.|On the third day, he rose again.

0:06:04:...he's quick on his toes,|he's hip, he's a con artist.
0:06:08:l think it's what l've been|working toward my whole career.
0:06:11:You've been working|towards Holocaust comedy?
0:06:14:-Anne!|-What, Bob?
0:06:29:Not in front of the children.|They look up to me.

0:07:42:You'll quit KNX?

0:07:48:Well, Donna Reed was part-time.
0:07:50:l just hope l can pull it off.|Hogan's in almost every scene.
0:07:53:You worry. You always worry,|but in the end you succeed.
0:07:58:Easy for you to say.
0:08:04:Hello, Henry.|Now, we're all professionals here.
0:08:08:You've all been working on your|characters, each with his own slant.
0:08:12:We have to keep in mind|this is a gang comedy.

0:08:22:Did you hear about the|Greek quarterback...
0:08:24:...who hated to leave|his buddies behind?

0:08:30:Let's pick up with Klink and Hogan.
0:08:33:The great disciplinarian...
0:08:36:...knows when to reward|and when to punish.
0:08:40:Now, my leniency|is a legend, right?

0:11:13:Forget it. Do you see this spread?
0:11:15:Yeah, l gotta hand it to CBS.

0:12:55:Yeah, l'll throw them away.
0:12:58:-l've seen them before. l just ignored it.|-All right, l get the message.
0:13:03:Bad enough l've gotta hide them|like some teenager.
0:13:06:Well, what did you have in mind?
0:13:08:Putting them on the coffee table|for our guests to see?
0:13:11:l apologize.
0:13:13:-Maybe we should see Father Donnelly.|-No, it's our business.
0:13:17:Family business.|We'll keep it at home.
0:13:20:You're never home. l just thought|when you started shooting Hogan's...
0:13:23:-...that this would change things.|-lt will, darling. Trust me. lt will.
0:13:31:Hogan's Heroes premiered|September 1 7, 1 965...

0:13:42:Of the new shows,|it was number one.
0:13:45:I've always had|an extraordinary amount of luck.
0:13:47:Being in the right place|at the right time.
0:13:49:There was some controversy|the first few months, but it died away.
0:13:53:Mondays we block ed the show.|Tuesdays we did exteriors.
0:13:56:Wednesdays and Thursdays|we did interiors.
0:13:59:Friday we'd have a table reading|of the next week's script.

0:19:37:...strip clubs.
0:19:39:Joints.
0:19:44:Would you be more comfortable|in the confessional?

0:20:51:Listen. l know several musicians.|We play from time to time.

0:22:57:Light hits this layer and stores|a charged density pattern on it...
0:23:01:...which is scanned with an electron|beam. So the resulting signal...
0:23:05:...is sent by cable|to where it's recorded on tape.
0:23:08:The helical-scan method of the VTR|issues proper magnetic coding...
0:23:12:...so picture quality is always secure.
0:23:16:-l've never seen anything like this.|-Of course not.
0:23:19:That's the point. lt's a prototype.
0:23:23:-That stereo over there.|-Yeah?

0:23:33:-Tonight?|-Of course.

0:26:07:Anything.
0:26:10:Can we leave the lights on?
0:26:17:-Dank e for the stockings, colonel.|-Don't tell anybody there's a war on.
0:26:31:Herr Kommandant,|Colonel Hogan to see you.
0:26:35:The second season,|Cynthia Lynn, who played Helga...
0:26:39:... was replaced by Patti Olsen,|screen name Sigrid Valdis.
0:26:42:The character's name was Hilda.
0:26:45:Herr Kommandant,|Colonel Hogan to see you.
0:26:49:Kommandant, you wanted to see me?
0:26:51:Yes, Hogan, l have a very serious|matter to discuss with you.

0:32:27:Herr Kommandant,|Colonel Hogan to see you.
0:32:35:Well, he did beat out|a million other sperm.
0:32:39:Think about that.
0:32:40:-Guess it's kind of hard to fathom.|-Yeah.
0:32:43:-You're so easy to talk to.|-lt's because l speak English, Sigrid.
0:32:50:-Call me Patricia.|-Patricia.
0:32:52:Sigrid is my stage name.|To you, l'm Patricia.
0:33:00:And what brought you back to L.A.?

0:33:10:Tired of being a housewife, you know?
0:33:13:So you came back here|where you can play one instead?
0:33:16:Something like that.
0:33:18:What about you, Hogan?|What are your dreams?
0:33:22:Besides drumming with Buddy Rich?
0:33:26:l dream about finding|somebody who gets me...
0:33:31:...who l am.
0:33:41:We're in the show together.
0:33:43:We have to keep up|the appearance of respectability.
0:33:46:l can be very respectable.
0:33:53:You're not really hungry, are you?
0:34:00:l'm gonna get the check.
0:34:02:Yeah.
0:34:05:We're a Christian publication,|Mr. Crane.
0:34:08:Please. lt's Bob.
0:34:09:So this is a little outside our|normal terrain. We usually don't do...
0:34:13:...Hollywood interviews,|what with the divorces and whatnot.
0:34:17:-Sure.|-That's why we're interested in you.
0:34:20:You've been married to your|high-school sweetheart for 1 6 years.
0:34:25:-Fifteen, actually.|-Fifteen years.
0:34:28:How do you do it? What's your secret?
0:34:32:Three words:
0:34:34:Don't...make...waves.
0:34:39:As every sailor knows,|when one set of waves meets...
0:34:42:...another set of waves|it can set up some chop.
0:34:45:And when three sets of waves|come together, it can make...
0:34:48:...for some mighty rough sailing.
0:34:51:lt also helps sometimes|to have a harmless safety valve.
0:34:55:Because when l get tense,|l blow off steam.
0:34:59:And so when it comes|to my own family...
0:35:02:...l don't make waves.
0:35:05:That's inspirational.|You're a fortunate man.
0:35:08:Yes.
0:35:11:Yes, l am.
0:35:22:-You want me to run lines with you?|-No, l got it.

0:35:47:Tense.
0:35:49:-Distant.|-Oh, you're being ridiculous.
0:35:53:Come on.

0:36:19:My goodness, she was built.
0:36:23:-Mindy.|-Mandy. Mandy!
0:36:26:We should name a ride after her.
0:36:28:-Loop-de-Loop.|-Tilt-A-Whirl.
0:36:31:Watching these home movies|gets me so damn hot.
0:36:34:-They're videos, Bob. Videos.|-l got a hard-on the size of Florida.
0:36:38:-What was that?|-What?
0:36:41:Rewind the tape.
0:36:45:Just rewind it.
0:36:51:Okay. Okay, just play it from there.
0:36:55:Play it right there.
0:36:56:-What's that on my ass?|-What?
0:36:58:Freeze it. Can you do that?
0:36:59:Not for long.|The image becomes unstable.
0:37:02:Freeze it right there!
