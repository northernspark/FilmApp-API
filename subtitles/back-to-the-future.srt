October is inventory time.

00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:35,784
So right now, Statler Toyota
is making the best deals of the year...

4
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:38,126
on all 1985 model Toyotas.

You won't find a better car...

At a better price with better service
anywhere in Hill Valley.

In other news, officials at
the Pacific Nuclear research facility...

11
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:59,377
have denied the rumor that
a case of missing plutonium...

12
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,114
was in fact stolen
from their vault two weeks ago.

13
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:05,885
A Libyan terrorist group had claimed
responsibility for the alleged theft.

14
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,622
However, officials now
attribute the discrepancy...

15
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,630
to a simple clerical error.

16
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:15,156

Oh, God.

28
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,693
Hey, Doc.
Where are you?

29
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:58,219
I've found you. Can you meet me
at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15?

30
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,232
I made a major breakthrough.
I'll need your assistance.

31
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,997
- 1:15 in the morning?
Doc, what's goin' on?
- Yeah.

32
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,095
- Where you been all week?
- Workin'.

33
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:09,266
- Is Einstein with you?
- Yeah, he's right here.

34
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:12,072
You left your equipment
on all week.

35
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,511
My equipment.
That reminds me, Marty.

36
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,516
Do not hook up to the amplifier. There's
a slight possibility of overload.

37
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:21,075
Yeah.
I'll keep that in mind.

38
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,622
Good. I'll see you tonight.
Don't forget now.

39
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,625
- 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall.
- Right.

40
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:38,330
- Are those my clocks I hear?
- Yeah, it's 8:00.

41
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:40,395
Perfect!
My experiment worked!

42
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:43,909
They're all exactly
25 minutes slow!

43
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:46,570
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Doc.

44
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:49,012
Are you telling me
that's it's 8:25?

45
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,073
- Precisely.
- Damn!

Strickland's looking for you.

00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,977
If you get caught,
it'll be four tardies in a row.

All right, come on.
I think we're safe.

61
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:07,616
This time wasn't my fault. The doc
set all his clocks 25 minutes slow.

62
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:12,756
The doc? Am I to understand
you're still hanging around
with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?

63
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:16,825
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker.

64
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:20,566
And one for you, McFly.
I believe that makes four in a row.

65
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,575
Let me give you a nickel's worth
of free advice, young man.

66
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:26,908
This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous.
He's a real nutcase.

67
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:29,413
Hang around with him,
you'll end up in big trouble.

68
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,416
Oh, yes, sir.

69
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:34,817
You got a real attitude problem.
You're a slacker.

70
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:39,381
You remind me of your father when
he went here. He was a slacker too.

71
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,552
Can I go now,
Mr. Strickland?

72
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:45,290
I notice your band is on the roster
for the dance auditions.

73
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:47,798
Why even bother, McFly?
You don't have a chance.

74
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,801
You're too much
like your old man.

75
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:53,805
No McFly ever amounted to anything
in the history of Hill Valley.

76
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,006
Yeah, well,
history is gonna change.

77
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,614
Next, please.

78
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,882

We'll never get a chance
to play in front of anybody.

90
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,611
Marty, one rejection
isn't the end of the world.

91
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,148
I just don't think
I'm cut out for music.

92
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:14,118
But you're good, Marty. You're really
good, and your audition tape is great.

93
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:16,381
You've gotta send it in
to the record company.

94
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:18,389
- It's like Doc's always saying.
- I know.

95
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:21,790
If you put your mind to it,
you can accomplish anything.

96
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,795
That's good advice, Marty.

97
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:27,526
All right. What if I send in
the tape and they don't like it?

98
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,534
What if they say
I'm no good?

99
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,695
What if they say,
"You got no future"?

100
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:35,298
I don't think I can take
that kind of rejection.

101
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,342
Jesus. I'm starting
to sound like my old man.

102
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,378
- He's not that bad.
- Save the clock tower.

103
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:41,470
He's letting you borrow
the car tomorrow night.

104
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,883
Check out that 4x4.

105
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:48,512
- <i>That is hot.</i>
- Back her up.

106
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,523
Someday, Jennifer.
Someday.

107
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,254
Wouldn't it be great to take
that truck up to the lake?

108
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,230
Throw a couple of sleeping bags
in the back.

109
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,268
Lie out underneath the stars.

110
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,930
- Stop it.
- What?

111
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,565
Does your mom know?
About tomorrow night?

112
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:12,702
Nah, get outta town. My mom thinks
I'm goin' campin' with the guys.

113
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,770
My mother would freak out if she knew
I was goin' up there with you.

114
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,839
I'd get
the standard lecture...

115
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:20,511
about how she never did
that stuff when she was a kid.

116
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:23,350
I mean, look,
I think the woman was born a nun.

117
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:26,118
She's just trying
to keep you respectable.

118
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:28,387
She's not doin'
a very good job.

119
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,328
- Terrible.
- Save the clock tower.

120
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,422
Save the clock tower.

121
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:37,560
Mayor Wilson is sponsoring
an initiative to replace that clock.

122
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,935
Thirty years ago,
lightning struck that clock tower...

123
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:42,270
and the clock
hasn't run since.

124
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:44,275
We at the Hill Valley
Preservation Society...

125
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,937
think it should be preserved
exactly the way it is...

126
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,106
as part of our history
and heritage.

127
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:50,910

00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,076

00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,874
without tellin' me
it had a blind spot.

152
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,876
I could've been killed.

153
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,378
Now, Biff,
I never noticed...

154
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:31,280
that the car had any blind spot
before when I would drive it.

155
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,341
Hi, son.

156
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,353
<i>Are you blind, McFly? It's there.</i>

157
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,355
<i>How else do you explain</i>
<i>that wreck out there?</i>

158
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,722
<i>Now, Biff, can</i> I...
<i>can I assume...</i>

159
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:43,557
that your, uh, insurance
is gonna pay for the damage?

160
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:45,995
<i>My</i> insurance?
It's your car.

161
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:49,000
Your insurance should pay for it.
I wanna know who's gonna pay for this.

162
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:52,060
I spilled beer when I was smashed into.
Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill?

163
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:55,073
-  Uh...
<i>- And where's my reports?</i>

164
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:59,510
I haven't finished those up yet, but I
figured since they weren't due till...

165
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:03,036
Hello? Hello?
Anybody home? Huh?

166
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,583
Think, McFly. Think!

167
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:07,585
I gotta have time
to get 'em retyped.

168
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:11,555
Do you realize what would happen if I
hand in my reports in your handwriting?

169
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,558
I'll get fired.

170
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,322
You wouldn't want that
to happen, would ya?

171
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,363
- Would ya?
- Of course not, Biff.

172
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,921
I wouldn't
want that to happen.

173
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,332
<i>Now, look. I'll finish</i>
<i>those reports tonight...</i>

174
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:26,838
and I'll run 'em on over
first thing tomorrow.

175
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,931
Not too early.
I sleep in Saturday.

176
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,942
Your shoe's untied.

177
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,672
Don't be so gullible, McFly.

178
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,737
Got the place fixed up nice.

179
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,284
I have your car towed
all the way to your house...

180
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,286
and all you got for me
is light beer?

181
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,425
What are you lookin' at,
butthead?

182
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:55,957
Say hi to your mom
for me.

183
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:02,604
I know what you're gonna say,
son, and you're right.

184
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,700
You're right.

185
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:08,679
But, uh, Biff just happens
to be my supervisor...

186
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:13,411
and I'm afraid I'm just not
very good at... confrontations.

187
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,578
But the car, Dad.

188
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,190
I mean, he wrecked it.
He totaled it.

189
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,628
I needed that car
tomorrow night, Dad.

190
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:27,154
Do you have any idea
how important this was to me?

191
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,167
<i>I know, and all</i>
<i>I can say is I'm...</i>

192
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,931
I'm sorry.

193
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:34,370
Believe me, Marty,
you're better off...

194
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,409
without having to worry
about all the aggravation...

195
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:40,912
and headaches
of playing at that dance.

196
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,914
<i>He's absolutely right.</i>

197
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:45,075
The last thing you need
is headaches.

198
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:56,794
Kids, we're gonna have to eat
this cake by ourselves.

199
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:59,262
Your Uncle Joey
didn't make parole again.

200
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,359
It would be nice if you
all dropped him a line.

201
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:09,100
- Uncle Jailbird Joey?
- He's your brother, Mom.

202
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:13,008
Yeah. It's a major embarrassment,
having an uncle in prison.

203
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,205
We all make mistakes
in life, children.

204
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:18,580
- Goddamn it. I'm late.
- David, watch your mouth!

205
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:21,279
You come here and kiss your mother
before you go.

206
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:24,379
Come on, Mom. Make it fast.
I'll miss my bus.

207
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,390
See you later, Pop.

208
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,188
Whoo! Time to change
that oil.

209
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,196
Oh. Ha-ha-ha.

210
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:35,825
<i>Hey, Marty. I'm not</i>
<i>your answering service.</i>

211
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:38,165
While you were outside
pouting over the car...

212
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,171
Jennifer Parker
called you twice.

213
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:45,176
<i>I don't like her. Any girl who calls</i>
<i>up a boy is just asking for trouble.</i>

214
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:48,077
<i>Oh, Mom. There's nothing wrong</i>
<i>with calling a boy.</i>

215
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:52,243
I think it's terrible.
Girls chasing boys.

216
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:55,446
When I was your age,
I never chased a boy or called a boy...

217
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:58,684
or sat in a parked car
with a boy.

218
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:02,557
<i>Then how am I ever</i>
<i>supposed to meet anybody?</i>

219
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,960
Well, it'll just happen.

220
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,362
Like the way
I met your father.

221
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:10,129
That was so stupid.
Grandpa hit him with the car.

222
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,136
It was meant to be.

223
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:15,071
Anyway...

224
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,598
if Grandpa hadn't hit him,
then none of you would have been born.

225
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:20,611
Yeah, well.

226
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:24,012
I still don't understand what Dad
was doin' in the middle of the street.

227
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,449
What was it, George?
Bird-watching?

228
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:29,078
What, Lorraine? What?

229
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:32,123
Anyway, your Grandpa
hit him with the car...

230
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,159
and brought him
into the house.

231
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,194
He seemed so helpless.

232
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,896
Like a little lost puppy,
and my heart just went out to him.

233
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:47,302
<i>Yeah, Mom, we know. You've told us</i>
<i>this story a million times.</i>
<i>You felt sorry for him.</i>

234
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:50,740
<i>So you decided to go with him</i>
<i>to the "Fish Under The Sea" dance.</i>

235
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:54,609
No. It was
the "Enchantment Under The Sea" dance.

236
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,979
Our first date.
I'll never forget it.

237
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,780
It was the night of that
terrible thunderstorm, remember, George?

238
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:08,453
Your father kissed me for
the very first time on that dance floor.

239
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,790
It was then
that I realized...

240
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,390
that I was gonna spend
the rest of my life with him.

241
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,773
Oh, no! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

242
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:30,281
# #

243
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,624
Hello.

244
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:47,631
Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you?

245
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:50,668
Ah, Doc. Uh, no.

246
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,829
No, don't be silly.

247
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,635
Listen, this is very important.
I forgot my video camera.

248
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:58,642
Can you pick it up at my place
on your way to the mall?

249
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,304
Uh, yeah.
I'm on my way.

250
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:29,664
- Einstein! Hey, Einstein,
where's the doc, boy?

251
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,460
Doc!

252
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,795
- Marty! You made it!
- Yeah.

253
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,800
Welcome to
my latest experiment.

254
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:31,859
This is the one I've been
waiting for all my life.

255
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,928
- Uh, well, it's a DeLorean.
- Bear with me.

256
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,601
All your questions will be answered.
Roll tape, and we'll proceed.

257
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,236
- Is that a Devo suit?
- Never mind that now.

258
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:42,303
- Not now.
- I'm ready.

259
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,679
Good evening.
I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.

260
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,378
I'm in the parking lot
of Twin Pines Mall.

261
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:50,751
It's Saturday morning,
October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m.

262
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:53,256
<i>This is temporal experiment</i>
<i>number one.</i>

263
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,759
Come on, Einie.
Get in there.

264
00:19:55,827 --> 00:20:00,264
Attaboy. In you go. Sit down.
Put your seat belt on.

265
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,337
Whoa, whoa. Okay.

266
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,738
Please note
that Einstein's clock...

267
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,779
is in precise synchronization
with my control watch.

268
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:17,007
- Got it? Good.
- Right. Check, Doc.

269
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,319
Have a good trip, Einstein.
Watch your head.

270
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,029
<i>You got that thing</i>
<i>hooked up to the... car?</i>

271
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:33,257
- Watch this.
- Yeah. Okay.

272
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,323
<i>Got it.</i>

273
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:39,929
Jesus!

274
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,201
Not me! The car!

275
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:06,487
If my calculations
are correct...

276
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:09,591
when this baby hits
88 miles per hour...

277
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,659
you're gonna see
some serious shit.

278
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:50,041
Watch this! Watch this!

279
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,957
Ah! What did I tell you?

280
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:13,259
Eighty-eight miles
per hour!

281
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:21,228
The temporal displacement occurred
exactly 1:20 a.m. And zero seconds!

282
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:25,134
Ah, Jesus Christ!

283
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,610
Jesus Christ, Doc!
You disintegrated Einstein!

284
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,113
Calm down. I didn't
disintegrate anything.

285
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:35,119
The molecular structure of both Einstein
and the car are completely intact.

286
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:39,590
- Then where the hell are they?
- The appropriate question is,
<i>"When</i> the hell are they?"

287
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:44,618
You see, Einstein has just become
the world's first time traveler!

288
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:48,359
I sent him
into the future!

289
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:50,867
One minute into the future,
to be exact.

290
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:53,905
At precisely 1:21 a.m.
And zero seconds...

291
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:56,497
we shall catch up with him
and the time machine.

292
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:04,142
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Doc. Uh...

293
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,980
Are you telling me that you
built a time machine...

294
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,987
out of a DeLorean?

295
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:14,492
If you're gonna build
a time machine into a car,
why not do it with some style?

296
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,357
Besides, the stainless steel
construction made the flux dispersal...

297
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,897
Look out!

298
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:07,337
- What? What? Is it hot?
- <i>It's cold.</i>

299
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:09,539
Damn cold.

300
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:14,179
Ah, ha-ha!
Einstein, you little devil!

301
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:19,921
Einstein's clock is exactly one minute
behind mine and still ticking!

302
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:25,695
- He's all right.
<i>- He's fine.</i>

303
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:28,096
He's completely unaware
that anything happened.

304
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,862
As far as he's concerned,
the trip was instantaneous.

305
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:33,370
That's why his watch
is exactly one minute behind mine.

306
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:36,566
He skipped over that minute to instantly
arrive at this moment in time.

307
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,041
Come here.
I'll show you how it works.

308
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:44,509
First, you turn
the time circuits on.

309
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,787
This readout tells you
where you're going...

310
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:52,585
this one tells you where you are,
this one tells you where you were.

311
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,648
You input your destination time
on this keypad.

312
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:57,593
Say you wanna see the signing of
the Declaration of Independence.

313
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:03,061
Or witness
the birth of Christ.

314
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:08,303
Here's a red-letter date
in the history of science.

315
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:11,137
November 5, 1955.

316
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:19,011
Yes, of course.
November 5, 1955.

317
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:22,918
What happened?

318
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:25,047
That was the day
I invented time travel.

319
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:29,355
<i>I remember it vividly. I was standing</i>
<i>on my toilet hanging a clock.</i>

320
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:32,362
The porcelain was wet.
I slipped, hit my head on the sink.

321
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,421
When I came to,
I had a revelation.

322
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:37,730
A vision. A picture in my head.
A picture of this.

323
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:41,294
This is what makes
time travel possible.

324
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,170
The flux capacitor.

325
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:47,575
- Flux capacitor?
- <i>It's taken almost 30 years</i>
<i>and my family fortune...</i>

326
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:49,944
to realize
the vision of that day.

327
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:52,848
My God, has it been that long?

328
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:54,977
Things have certainly changed
around here.

329
00:25:56,922 --> 00:26:00,722
I remember when this was all farmland
as far as the eye could see.

330
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,890
Old man Peabody
owned all of this.

331
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:09,900
He had this crazy idea
about breeding pine trees.

332
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:16,197
This is, uh...
This is heavy-duty, Doc.

333
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:20,301
This is great. Does it run on
regular unleaded gasoline?

334
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:24,109
Unfortunately, no. It requires something
with a little more kick. Plutonium.

335
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:26,480
Uh, plutonium.
Wait a minute. Are you...

336
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:28,951
Are you tellin' me
that this sucker is nuclear?

337
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,215
Hey, hey, hey.
Keep rolling there.

338
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:34,520
<i>No, this sucker's electrical, but I need</i>
<i>a nuclear reaction to generate...</i>

339
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,652
the 1.21 gigawatts
of electricity I need.

340
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:40,186
You don't just walk into a store
and buy plutonium.

341
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,063
<i>Did you rip that off?</i>

342
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:46,637
Of course. From a group
of Libyan nationalists.

343
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:48,639
They wanted me
to build them a bomb.

344
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:52,905
So I took their plutonium and
gave them a bomb casing full of
used pinball machine parts.

345
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:56,414
- Come on!
Let's get you a radiation suit.
- Jesus!

346
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,678
It's safe now.
Everything's lead-lined.

347
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:32,140
Don't you lose
those tapes now.

348
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:34,208
I need that as a record.

349
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:36,276
Let's put this back here.
There we go.

350
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:40,752
Whoop! Almost forgot
my luggage.

351
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,487
Who knows if they've got
cotton underwear in the future.

352
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:46,462
- I'm allergic to all synthetics.
- The future.

353
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:48,465
- That's where you're goin'.
- That's right.

354
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:50,467
Twenty-five years
into the future.

355
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:53,436
I've always dreamed of seeing
the future, looking beyond my years...

356
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,473
seeing the progress
of mankind.

357
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,940
- Why not?
- I'll also be able to see who wins...

358
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,910
the next 25 World Series.

359
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:05,473
- Uh, Doc. Uh, look me up
when you get there.
- Huh?

360
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:08,610
Indeed I will.
Roll 'em.

361
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:14,350
Ahem!

362
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:17,793
I, Dr. Emmett Brown...

363
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:21,991
am about to embark
on an historic journey.

364
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:26,236
What am I thinking of?

365
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:28,568
I almost forgot to bring
extra plutonium.

366
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,040
How do I expect to get back?
One pellet, one trip.

367
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:33,577
I must be out of my mind.

368
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:36,637
What is it, Einie?

369
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:49,485
Oh, my God. They found me.
I don't know how, but they found me.

370
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,496
- <i>Run for it, Marty!</i>
- Who? Who?

371
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:56,193
Who do you think?
The Libyans!

372
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:00,027
Holy shit!

373
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:06,875
I'll draw their fire!

374
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,947
Doc, wait!

375
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,065
No!

376
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:33,001
You bastard!

377
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:53,418
Go!

378
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,662
Go!

379
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:44,032
Come on! Move!
Damn it!

380
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:47,873
<i>Jesus!</i>

381
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:08,991
Holy shit!

382
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:11,900
Let's see if you bastards
can do 90.

383
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:06,681
<i>Lord, what is it? What is it, Pa?</i>

384
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:10,421
Looks like an airplane...
without wings.

385
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:13,987
That ain't no airplane.
Look.

386
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:37,179
- Don't look!
- Listen... Whoa!

387
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:51,701
Hello?

388
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,829
Uh, excuse me.

389
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,243
Sorry about your barn.

390
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:07,280
It's already mutated
into human form! Shoot it!

391
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,353
Take that,
you mutated son of a bitch!

392
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:19,058
- <i>It's getting away!</i>
<i>- Hold it!</i>

393
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,189
Shoot it, Pa!

394
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:26,460
My pine! Why, you...

395
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:31,975
<i>You space bastard! You killed my pine!</i>

396
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:40,816
Okay, McFly. Get a grip on yourself.
It's all a dream.

397
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:43,479
Just a very intense dream.

398
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,554
Whoa! Listen,
you gotta help me.

399
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:31,193
Don't stop, Wilbur! Drive!

400
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:33,260
Can't be.

401
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,444
This is nuts.

402
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:47,917
Oh, come on.

403
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:50,681

454
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:16,583
You wouldn't want that
to happen, would ya?

455
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:21,257
- Would ya? No.
- Of course not.

456
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:23,259
I wouldn't want
that to happen.

457
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:25,261
What are you lookin' at,
butthead?

458
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:28,787
Get a load of this guy's life preserver.
Dork thinks he's gonna drown.

459
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,834
How 'bout my homework,
McFly?

460
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:32,835
Uh, okay, Biff.

461
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:35,269
Well, I'll, uh...
I'll finish that on up tonight...

462
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:38,137
and then I'll bring it over
first thing tomorrow morning.

463
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:41,542
Not too early. I sleep in Sundays.
Your shoe's untied!

464
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:44,706
Don't be so gullible, McFly.

465
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:48,047
- I don't wanna see you in here again.
- Okay. All right. Bye-bye.

466
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,172
- What?
- You're George McFly!

467
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,178
Yeah. Who are you?

468
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:18,113
What do you let those boys
push you around like that for?

469
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:20,116
- They're bigger than me.
- Stand tall, boy!

470
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:22,118
Have some respect
for yourself.

471
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:24,552
<i>Don't you know if you</i>
<i>let people walk over you now...</i>

472
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:26,920
they'll walk over you
for the rest of your life.

473
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:30,017
Look at me. You think I'm gonna
spend my life in this slop house?

474
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,187
- Watch it, Goldie.
- No, sir!

475
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,027
<i>I'm gonna make somethin'of myself.</i>
<i>I'm goin'to night school.</i>

476
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:38,500
- One day, I'm gonna be somebody.
- That's right. He's gonna be mayor.

477
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:40,662
Yeah, I'm...

478
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:44,640
Mayor! Now that's
a good idea!

479
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:46,642
I could run for mayor.

480
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:49,838
- A colored mayor. That'll be the day.
- Wait and see, Mr. Carruthers.

481
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:53,281
I will be mayor. I'll be the most
powerful man in Hill Valley...

482
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,284
and I'm gonna
clean up this town.

483
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:57,513
Good. You can start
by sweeping the floor.

484
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:03,055
Mayor Goldie Wilson.

485
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,061
I like the sound of that.

486
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:20,908
Hey, Dad! George!
Hey, you on the bike!

487
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:54,267
He's a Peeping Tom!

488
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,050
Dad!

489
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:16,061
Hey, wait... Wait a minute.
Who are you?

490
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:22,068
Stella! Another one of these damn kids
jumped in front of my car!

491
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:25,597
<i>Come out here!</i>
<i>Help me take him in the house!</i>

492
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:32,809
Mom?

493
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,817
<i>That you?</i>

494
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,877
There, there, now.
Just relax.

495
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:42,925
You've been asleep
for almost nine hours now.

496
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:47,764
I had a...
horrible nightmare.

497
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:51,994
I dreamed that
I went back in time.

498
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,469
<i>It was terrible.</i>

499
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:57,371
Well, you're safe
and sound now...

500
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:59,636
back in good old 1955.

501
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,539
1955?

502
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:09,176
You're my mo...
You're my mo...

503
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,312
My name is Lorraine.

504
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,817
- Lorraine Baines?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

505
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:19,285
But you're, uh...
You're so, uh...

506
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:22,332
You're so...
thin!

507
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:25,493
Just relax, Calvin.
You got a big bruise on your head.

508
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:31,466
Ah! Where are my pants?

509
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:35,307
Over there...
on my hope chest.

510
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:40,178
I've never seen
purple underwear before, Calvin.

511
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:43,617
Calvin? Why... Why do you
keep calling me Calvin?

512
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:47,088
That is your name, isn't it?
Calvin Klein.

513
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:49,216
It's written all over your underwear.

514
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:52,829
I guess they
call you Cal, huh?

515
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:56,662
No, actually, people...
call me Marty.

516
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:58,668
Oh.

517
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:00,727
Pleased to meet you,
Calvin...

518
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:03,730
Marty...

519
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,799
Klein.

520
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:15,347
- Do you mind if I sit here?
- No.

521
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:18,650
Fine. No. Good.
Fine. Good.

522
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:23,756
- That's a big bruise you have there.
- Ahh!

523
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,887
<i>Lorraine, are you up there?</i>

524
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:28,898
Oh, my God!
It's my mother!

525
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:31,958
Quick!
Put your pants back on!

526
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:43,013
Tell me, Marty,
how long have you been in port?

527
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,014
- Excuse me?
- I guessed you're a sailor.

528
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:47,141
That's why you wear
that life preserver.

529
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:49,151
Uh, Coast Guard.

530
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:53,747
Sam, here's the young man you hit with
your car. He's all right. Thank God.

531
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:55,792
What were you doin'
in the middle of the street?

532
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:58,623
Don't pay attention to him.
He's in one of his moods.

533
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:01,494
Quit fiddling with that thing.
Come in here to dinner.

534
00:45:01,565 --> 00:45:03,499
You already know Lorraine.

535
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:06,035
This is Milton,
this is Sally...

536
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:10,096
that's Toby, and over there in
the playpen is little baby Joey.

537
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:14,675
So you're my Uncle Joey.

538
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:17,612
Better get used to these bars, kid.

539
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:21,879
<i>Yes. Joey just</i> loves
<i>being in his playpen.</i>

540
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:25,547
He cries whenever we take him out,
so we leave him in there all the time.

541
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:27,920
Well, Marty,
I hope you like meat loaf.

542
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:30,016
Well, listen,
I really oughta...

543
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:32,028
Sit here, Marty.

544
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:36,556
Sam, stop fiddling with that thing
and come in here and eat your dinner.

545
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:39,966
<i>Oh, ho, ho! Look at it roll.</i>

546
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:42,096
Now we can watch
Jackie Gleason while we eat.

547
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,774
<i>Bang! Zoom!</i>

548
00:45:50,848 --> 00:45:54,340
Our first television set.
Dad just picked it up today.

549
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:57,544
Do you have a television?

550
00:45:57,621 --> 00:46:00,317
Well, yeah, ya know,
we have... two of'em.

551
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:03,052
Wow! You must be rich.

552
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:07,655
Oh, honey, he's teasing you.
Nobody has two television sets.

553
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:16,395
Hey... Hey, I've seen this one.
This is a classic.

554
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:19,306
This is where Ralph dresses up
as a man from space.

555
00:46:19,376 --> 00:46:23,039
What do you mean you've seen this?
It's brand new.

556
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,809
Yeah, well,
I saw it on a... rerun.

557
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:29,649
- What's a rerun?
- You'll find out.

558
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,484
You know, Marty,
you look so familiar to me.

559
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:34,490
<i>Do I know your mother?</i>

560
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:37,550
Yeah, I think maybe you do.

561
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:41,086
<i>Then I wanna give her a call.</i>
<i>I don't want her to worry about you.</i>

562
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:43,292
You can't. Uh...

563
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:46,734
That is, uh, nobody,
uh, nobody's home.

564
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:50,262
- Oh.
- Yet.

565
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,433
Oh.

566
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:55,876
Uh, listen. Do you know
where Riverside Drive is?

567
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:59,109
It's on the other end of town.
A block past Maple.

568
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:01,117
<i>East end of town.</i>

569
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:03,949
A block past Maple.
That's John F. Kennedy Drive.

570
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:07,690
Who the hell
is John F. Kennedy?

571
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:09,692
<i>Mother?</i>

572
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,285
<i>With Marty's parents</i>
<i>out of town...</i>

573
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:15,456
don't you think
he oughta spend the night?

574
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:17,966
After all, Dad almost
killed him with the car.

575
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:19,969
That's true, Marty.

576
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:23,370
I think you should spend the night.
I think you're our responsibility.

577
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:28,036
- Well, gee, I don't know.
- And he can sleep in my room.

578
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:30,170
I gotta go! I gotta go.
Thanks very much.

579
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:32,909
It was wonderful. You were all great.
See you all later.

580
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:36,414
Much later.

581
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,082
He's a very strange
young man.

582
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:44,093
He's an idiot.

583
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:48,063
<i>Comes from upbringing.</i>
<i>His parents are probably idiots too.</i>

584
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:51,931
<i>Lorraine, you ever have a kid</i>
<i>who acts that way, I'll disown you.</i>

585
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,141
Doc?

586
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:34,677
- Don't say a word.
- Doc!

587
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,236
I don't wanna know
anything about you.

588
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:39,248
- Listen, Doc... Doc...
- Quiet!

589
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:42,547
- Don't tell me anything. Quiet.
- You gotta help...

590
00:48:45,555 --> 00:48:48,456
I'm gonna read your thoughts.
Let's see now.

591
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:51,392
You come here
from a great distance?

592
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:53,895
- Yeah. Exactly.
- Don't tell me!

593
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:57,024
<i>You want me to buy a subscription</i>
<i>to</i> The Saturday Evening Post?

594
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,694
- No!
- Not a word! Not a word now!

595
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,704
Quiet.

596
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,798
Uh... donations.

597
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:06,934
You want me
to make a donation...

598
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:09,308
to the Coast Guard
Youth Auxiliary.

599
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:11,404
Doc...

600
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:15,010
I'm from the future.

601
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:18,077
I came here in a time machine
that you invented.

602
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:21,056
Now, I need your help
to get back to the year...

603
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,718
1985.

604
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,786
By God!

605
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:32,997
Do you know
what this means?

606
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:38,740
It means that this damn thing
doesn't work at all!

607
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:43,212
Doc, you gotta help me.
You are the only one who knows
how your time machine works.

608
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,441
Time machine?

609
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:47,449
I haven't invented
any time machine.

610
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:51,653
Okay. All right.
I'll prove it to you.

611
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:54,953
Look at my driver's license.
Expires 1987.

612
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:58,620
Look at my birthday.
I haven't even been born yet.

613
00:49:58,695 --> 00:50:00,788
And look at this picture.

614
00:50:00,864 --> 00:50:03,094
It's my brother,
my sister and me.

615
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:07,330
Look at her sweatshirt, Doc.
"Class of 1984"?

616
00:50:07,404 --> 00:50:11,932
Pretty mediocre photographic fakery.
They cut off your brother's hair.

617
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,705
I'm tellin' the truth.
You gotta believe me.

618
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:16,746
Then tell me, "future boy,"

619
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:22,111
who's president
of the United States in 1985?

620
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:26,246
- Ronald Reagan.
- Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha!

621
00:50:27,324 --> 00:50:29,792
Then who's vice president?
Jerry Lewis?

622
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:33,686
I suppose Jane Wyman
is the First Lady.

623
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:37,063
- Wait, Doc!
- And Jack Benny
is secretary of the treasury!

624
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:40,626
- Doc, you gotta listen to me!
- I've had enough practical
jokes for one evening.

625
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:43,172
- Good night, future boy!
- No, wait, Doc. Doc!

626
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:47,609
Th-The bruise on your head.
I know how that happened.
You told me the whole story.

627
00:50:47,677 --> 00:50:50,077
You were standing on
your toilet hanging a clock...

628
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:52,581
and you fell and hit your head
on the sink...

629
00:50:52,649 --> 00:50:55,641
and that's when you came up
with the idea for the flux capacitor...

630
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:59,519
which is what makes
time travel possible.

631
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:17,003
There's something wrong with
the starter, so I hid it... here.

632
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:29,318
After I fell
off my toilet...

633
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:32,412
I drew this.

634
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:37,683
<i>The flux capacitor.</i>

635
00:51:55,345 --> 00:51:59,076
It works!

636
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:01,117
It works!

637
00:52:02,185 --> 00:52:04,551
I finally invent something
that works!

638
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:08,557
You bet your ass
it works.

639
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:11,458
Somehow we've gotta sneak this
back to my laboratory.

640
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:13,519
We've gotta get you home!

641
00:52:13,597 --> 00:52:15,656
Here, Doc.
This is it.

642
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,065
Never mind that.
Never mind that now.

643
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,571
Why, that's me!
Look at me!

644
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,664
- I'm an old man!
- I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.

645
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:26,800
I'm in the parking lot
of Twin Pines Mall.

646
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:28,970
Thank God,
I've still got my hair.

647
00:52:29,045 --> 00:52:31,036
What's this thing
I'm wearing?

648
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:33,275
This is a radiation suit.

649
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:35,284
Radiation suit?

650
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:38,788
Of course. Because of all
the fallout from the atomic wars.

651
00:52:39,856 --> 00:52:42,757
This... is truly amazing.

652
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:45,420
A portable television studio.

653
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:49,431
No wonder your president
has to be an actor.
He's got to look good on television.

654
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:51,933
Whoa. This is the part
comin' up, Doc.

655
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:54,027
No, no, no, no.
This sucker's electrical...

656
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:57,164
but I need a nuclear reaction
to generate the 1.21 gigawatts...

657
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,174
What did I just say?

658
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:05,471
...this sucker's electrical,
but I need a nuclear reaction...

659
00:53:05,549 --> 00:53:07,483
to generate the 1.21 gigawatts
of electricity...

660
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:09,576
1.21 gigawatts!

661
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:13,281
1.21 gigawatts.

662
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:17,292
Great Scott!

663
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,294
<i>What...</i>

664
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:21,887
What the hell
is a gigawatt?

665
00:53:21,965 --> 00:53:24,433
How could I have been
so careless?

666
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:26,492
1.21 gigawatts!

667
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:31,030
Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind
of power? It can't be done, can it?

668
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:34,167
Doc, look. All we need
is a little plutonium.

669
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:36,576
Oh! I'm sure
that in 1985...

670
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:38,773
plutonium is available
in every corner drugstore...

671
00:53:38,848 --> 00:53:41,646
but in 1955,
it's a little hard to come by.

672
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:45,518
Marty, I'm sorry,
but I'm afraid you're stuck here.

673
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:48,422
Whoa, Doc, stuck here?
I can't be stuck here.

674
00:53:48,491 --> 00:53:50,925
I got a life in 1985.

675
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:52,928
- I got a girl.
- Is she pretty?

676
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:55,829
Doc, she's beautiful.
She...

677
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:58,026
She's crazy about me.
Look at this.

678
00:53:58,101 --> 00:54:00,194
Look what she
wrote here, Doc.

679
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:02,602
I mean,
that says it all.

680
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:06,039
Doc, you're my only hope.

681
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:09,806
Marty, I'm sorry, but the only
power source capable of generating...

682
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:12,939
1.21 gigawatts of electricity
is a bolt of lightning.

683
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:16,984
- What did you say?
- A bolt of lightning.

684
00:54:17,053 --> 00:54:20,386
Unfortunately, you never know when
or where it's ever gonna strike.

685
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:24,990
We do now.

686
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:31,123
This is it!

687
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:33,396
<i>This</i> is the answer.

688
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,870
It says here
that a bolt of lightning...

689
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:41,172
is gonna strike the clock tower
at 10:04 p.m. Next Saturday night!

690
00:54:44,014 --> 00:54:47,472
If we could somehow harness
this lightning...

691
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:51,917
channel it into
the flux capacitor...

692
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:54,582
<i>it just might work.</i>

693
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:56,956
Next Saturday night...

694
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:59,325
we're sending you
back to the future!

695
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:02,464
All right. Saturday's good.
Saturday's good.

696
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:05,899
I can spend a week in 1955.
I can hang out. You can show me around.

697
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:09,370
That is completely out of the question.
You must not leave this house.

698
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:11,532
You must not see anybody
or talk to anybody.

699
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:14,076
Anything you do can have serious
repercussions on future events.

700
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,578
Do you understand?

701
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:19,513
Yeah. Sure. Okay.

702
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:24,519
Have you interacted with
anybody else today besides me?

703
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:29,251
I'm... Yeah, well, I might've
sort of bumped into my parents.

704
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:31,260
Great Scott!

705
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,819
Let me see that photograph again
of your brother.

706
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,792
Just as I thought. This proves
my theory. Look at your brother.

707
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:44,634
<i>His head's gone.</i>
<i>It's like it's been erased.</i>

708
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:48,401
Erased from existence.

709
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:56,945
Whoa! They really cleaned this place up.
Looks brand new.

710
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:00,615
Remember, according to
my theory, you interfered with
your parents' first meeting.

711
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,523
If they don't meet, they won't
fall in love, get married and have kids.

712
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:06,255
That's why your older brother's
disappearing from that photograph.

713
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:09,457
Your sister will follow, and unless
you repair the damage, you'll be next.

714
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:12,660
- Sounds pretty heavy.
- Weight has nothing to do with it.

715
00:56:12,736 --> 00:56:16,263
Which one's your pop?
That's him.

716
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:19,904
Okay. Okay, you guys.

717
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:24,242
Ha, ha, ha, ha. Very funny.
You guys are being real mature.

718
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:26,908
Maybe you were adopted.

719
00:56:26,983 --> 00:56:29,451
Okay, real mature, guys.

720
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:33,350
- Okay, pick up my books.
- McFly.

721
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:37,257
That's Strickland.
Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?

722
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:40,194
Shape up, man.
You're a slacker.

723
00:56:40,263 --> 00:56:44,529
- Do you wanna be a slacker
for the rest of your life?
- No.

724
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:47,434
- What did your mother
ever see in that kid?
- I don't know.

725
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:52,134
I guess she felt sorry for him
'cause her dad hit him with the car.

726
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:54,699
He hit me
with the car.

727
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:56,712
That's the
"Florence Nightingale effect."

728
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,510
It happens in hospitals when nurses
fall in love with their patients.

729
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:01,174
Go to it, kid.

730
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:05,513
Hey, George, buddy.

731
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:07,988
I have been lookin'
all over for you.

732
00:57:08,057 --> 00:57:11,185
You remember me, the guy who
saved your life the other day?

733
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,195
Oh. Yeah.

734
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,254
Good. There's somebody
I'd like you to meet.

735
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:21,536
Lorraine?

736
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:23,765
Calvin!

737
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:27,071
I'd like you to meet
my good friend George McFly.

738
00:57:27,143 --> 00:57:30,078
Hi. It's really
a pleasure to meet you.

739
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:33,741
- How's your head?
- Uh, good. Fine.

740
00:57:33,817 --> 00:57:37,514
I've been so worried about you
ever since you ran off the other night.

741
00:57:37,587 --> 00:57:39,578
A-Are you okay?

742
00:57:39,656 --> 00:57:43,717
- Come on. We're tardy! Come on!
- Sorry. I have to go.

743
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:45,784
Isn't he a dreamboat?

744
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:53,060
- She didn't even look at him.
- This is more serious than I thought.

745
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:55,070
Apparently, your mother
is amorously infatuated with you...

746
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:57,402
instead of your father.

747
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,465
Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc.
Are you trying to tell me...

748
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:02,340
that my mother...
has got the hots for me?

749
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:05,074
- Precisely.
- Whoa. This is heavy.

750
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:08,709
Heavy.
Why are things so heavy in the future?

751
00:58:08,785 --> 00:58:11,618
- Is there a problem with
the Earth's gravitational pull?
- What?

752
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:15,021
The only way we're gonna get those two
to mate is if they are alone together.

753
00:58:15,091 --> 00:58:17,582
So you've gotta get your father
and mother to interact...

754
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:20,993
in some sort of social...

755
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:22,998
What, you mean like a date?

756
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:25,125
- Right!
- What kind of date?

757
00:58:25,201 --> 00:58:27,431
What do kids do in the '50s?

758
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,631
They're your parents.
You must know them.

759
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:33,198
What are their common interests?
What do they like to do together?

760
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:35,210
Well, nothing.

761
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:38,179
<i>Look! There's a rhythmic</i>
<i>ceremonial ritual coming up.</i>

762
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:40,307
Of course!
The Enchantment Under The Sea dance!

763
00:58:40,383 --> 00:58:43,784
They're supposed to go to this. That's
where they kiss for the first time.

764
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:46,413
All right, kid. You stick
to your father like glue...

765
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:48,423
and make sure he takes her
to that dance.

766
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:51,156
George, buddy.

767
00:58:51,227 --> 00:58:55,459
Remember that girl
I introduced you to? Lorraine?

768
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,471
What are you writing?

769
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,666
Uh, stories.

770
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:08,973
Science fiction stories
about visitors...

771
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:12,242
coming down to Earth
from other planets.

772
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:18,612
Get outta town! I didn't know
you did anything creative.

773
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:21,521
- Let me read some.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

774
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:24,754
I never... I never let
anybody read my stories.

775
00:59:24,827 --> 00:59:26,761
Why not?

776
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:28,797
Well, what if they
didn't like them?

777
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:31,595
What if they told me
I was no good?

778
00:59:33,169 --> 00:59:36,138
I guess that would be pretty hard
for somebody to understand.

779
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,004
Uh, no.
No, not hard at all.

780
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:45,070
So anyway, George,
about Lorraine...

781
00:59:45,148 --> 00:59:47,446
she really likes you.

782
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:50,782
She told me to tell you
that she wants you to ask her...

783
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:53,185
- to the Enchantment Under The Sea dance.
- Really?

784
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:57,989
Oh, yeah. All you gotta do
is go over there and ask her.

785
00:59:58,061 --> 01:00:01,394
What, right here, right now in
the cafeteria? What if she said no?

786
01:00:01,464 --> 01:00:05,628
I don't know if I could take
that kind of a rejection.

787
01:00:05,702 --> 01:00:10,503
Besides, I think she'd
rather go with somebody else.

788
01:00:10,573 --> 01:00:12,564
Uh, who?

789
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:16,445
Biff.

790
01:00:16,512 --> 01:00:19,072
- Little kiss. Come on.
- Come on. Leave.

791
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:21,207
<i>You want it. You know you want it.</i>

792
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:23,309
You know you want me
to give it to you.

793
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:27,254
- Shut your filthy mouth.
I'm not that kind of girl.
- Ooh.

794
01:00:27,323 --> 01:00:29,917
Maybe you are and you
just don't know it yet.

795
01:00:29,993 --> 01:00:31,927
Get your meat hooks off of me.

796
01:00:31,995 --> 01:00:34,657
<i>You heard her.</i>
<i>She said get your meat hooks...</i>

797
01:00:34,731 --> 01:00:36,756
off.

798
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:39,734
Uh, please.

799
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:42,930
So what's it to you,
butthead?

800
01:00:43,006 --> 01:00:44,940
You know, you been
lookin' for a...

801
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:48,671
Fight, fight, fight.

802
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:58,379
Since you're new here, uh,
I'm gonna cut you a break...

803
01:00:58,454 --> 01:01:00,888
today.

804
01:01:00,957 --> 01:01:03,357
So why don't you
make like a tree...

805
01:01:03,426 --> 01:01:05,394
and get outta here.

806
01:01:17,206 --> 01:01:20,198
<i>George!</i>

807
01:01:20,276 --> 01:01:22,244
Why do you keep
following me around?

808
01:01:22,311 --> 01:01:25,212
Look, George.
I'm telling you, George...

809
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:27,215
if you do not ask Lorraine
to that dance...

810
01:01:27,283 --> 01:01:30,218
- I'm gonna regret it
for the rest of my life.
- But I can't go to the dance.

811
01:01:30,286 --> 01:01:33,483
I'll miss my favorite television
program, <i>Science Fiction Theater.</i>

812
01:01:33,556 --> 01:01:37,083
Yeah, but, George,
Lorraine wants to go with you.

813
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:40,425
- Give her a break.
- Look, I'm just not ready...

814
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:43,192
to ask Lorraine
out to the dance.

815
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:46,292
And not you or anybody else
on this planet...

816
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:48,599
is gonna make me
change my mind.

817
01:01:55,812 --> 01:01:57,905
<i>Science Fiction Theater.</i>

818
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:31,012
Who are you?

819
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:39,121
<i>Silence, Earthling.</i>

820
01:02:39,188 --> 01:02:41,656
My name is Darth Vader.

821
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:50,930
<i>I am an extraterrestrial</i>
<i>from the planet Vulcan.</i>

822
01:02:52,702 --> 01:02:55,170
Marty!

823
01:02:57,006 --> 01:02:59,406
- Marty! Marty!
- Hey, George, buddy.

824
01:02:59,475 --> 01:03:01,739
You weren't at school.
What have you been doing all day?

825
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:04,439
I overslept.
Look, I need your help.

826
01:03:04,514 --> 01:03:07,608
I have to ask Lorraine out,
but I don't know how to do it.

827
01:03:07,683 --> 01:03:10,345
All right, listen. Keep your pants on.
She's over in the cafe.

828
01:03:10,419 --> 01:03:12,444
God! How do you...

829
01:03:15,558 --> 01:03:17,492
What made you change
your mind, George?

830
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:20,154
Last night, Darth Vader
came down from planet Vulcan...

831
01:03:20,229 --> 01:03:23,255
and told me that if I didn't take
Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.

832
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:27,234
Yeah, well, let's just keep this
brain-melting stuff to ourselves, okay?

833
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:30,670
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- All right, okay. There she is, George.

834
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:33,072
- <i>Now just go in there and invite her.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

835
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:35,667
- But I don't know what to say.
- Just say anything, George.

836
01:03:35,745 --> 01:03:38,839
Say whatever's natural, the first thing
that comes into your mind.

837
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:42,177
Nothing's coming to my mind.

838
01:03:42,251 --> 01:03:44,185
Jesus, George.
It's a wonder I was even born.

839
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:47,120
- What? What?
- Nothing, nothing. Nothing.

840
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:51,024
Look. Tell her destiny
brought you together.

841
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:53,084
Tell her that she is
the most beautiful girl...

842
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:55,357
you have ever seen
in the world.

843
01:03:55,431 --> 01:03:58,366
Girls like that stuff.
What are you doing, George?

844
01:03:58,434 --> 01:04:00,425
I'm writing this down.
This is good stuff.

845
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:03,529
- Yeah. Okay, let's go.
Can you take care of that?
- Oh, right.

846
01:04:22,225 --> 01:04:25,194
Lou, give me a milk.

847
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:28,196
Chocolate.

848
01:04:34,971 --> 01:04:36,939
And a cherry Coke.

849
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:47,209
Lorraine? My density...

850
01:04:47,283 --> 01:04:49,342
has popped me to you.

851
01:04:50,453 --> 01:04:52,921
- What?
- Oh.

852
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:56,516
What I meant to say was...

853
01:04:56,592 --> 01:04:58,526
Wait a minute.
Don't I know you from somewhere?

854
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:02,120
<i>Yes. Yes.</i>

855
01:05:02,198 --> 01:05:05,361
I'm George.
George McFly.

856
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:07,425
I'm your density.

857
01:05:07,503 --> 01:05:09,630
I mean...

858
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,674
Your destiny.

859
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:15,370
Oh.

860
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,440
Hey, McFly!

861
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:20,107
Oh, gee...

862
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:23,916
I thought I told you
never to come in here.

863
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:30,720
Well, it's gonna cost you.
How much money you got on you?

864
01:05:30,793 --> 01:05:33,660
Well, how much
do you want, Biff?

865
01:05:41,704 --> 01:05:43,638
All right, punk.

866
01:05:43,706 --> 01:05:47,073
- Now I'm gonna...
- Whoa, whoa, Biff. What's that?

867
01:05:53,082 --> 01:05:56,711
That's Calvin Klein.
Oh, my God, he's a dream.

868
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:59,812
Whoa! Kid! Kid, stop!
Stop, stop. Stop!

869
01:05:59,889 --> 01:06:01,823
- Stop.
- Hey!

870
01:06:01,891 --> 01:06:04,189
I'll get it back to you,
all right?

871
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:06,524
You broke it!

872
01:06:06,595 --> 01:06:08,563
Come back here!

873
01:06:10,566 --> 01:06:12,557
Wow! Look at him go!

874
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:15,860
Get him!

875
01:06:28,684 --> 01:06:30,515
To the car! Go!

876
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:39,827
- What's that thing he's on?
- It's a board with wheels.

877
01:06:39,895 --> 01:06:41,829
He's an absolute dream.

878
01:06:41,897 --> 01:06:44,695
- Come on, come on!
- <i>Look out for the car!</i>

879
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:19,425
<i>I'm gonna ram him.</i>

880
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:29,470
Shit!

881
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:41,322
Whoo!

882
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:55,270
Thanks a lot, kid.

883
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:58,632
I'm gonna get
that son of a bitch.

884
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:01,801
- Where does he come from?
- Yeah, where does he live?

885
01:08:01,877 --> 01:08:04,368
I don't know...

886
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:06,438
but I'm gonna find out.

887
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:15,049
<i>Oh, my God. They found me.</i>

888
01:08:15,124 --> 01:08:18,924
<i>I don't know how, but they found me.</i>
<i>Run for it, Marty!</i>

889
01:08:22,665 --> 01:08:26,431
Oh, my God.
They found me.

890
01:08:26,502 --> 01:08:30,438
<i>I don't know how, but they found me.</i>
<i>Run for it, Marty!</i>

891
01:08:30,506 --> 01:08:32,906
Doc?

892
01:08:32,975 --> 01:08:36,775
Oh, hi, Marty.
I didn't hear you come in.

893
01:08:36,846 --> 01:08:40,213
Fascinating device,
this video unit.

894
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:42,250
Listen, Doc.

895
01:08:42,318 --> 01:08:45,378
There's something I haven't told you
about the night we made that tape.

896
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:47,388
Please, Marty, don't tell me.
No man should know too much
about his own destiny.

897
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:49,390
- You don't understand.
- I <i>do</i> understand.

898
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:51,585
If I know too much about my future,
I could endanger my existence...

899
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:53,890
just as you have
endangered yours.

900
01:08:55,531 --> 01:08:57,465
You... You're right.

901
01:08:57,533 --> 01:09:00,627
Now, let me show you my plan
for sending you home.

902
01:09:00,703 --> 01:09:02,637
Please excuse the crudity
of this model.

903
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:05,230
I didn't have time to
build it to scale or to paint it.

904
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:08,435
- It's good.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

905
01:09:08,511 --> 01:09:11,503
Okay, now, we run some
industrial-strength electrical cable...

906
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:14,413
from the top
of the clock tower, down...

907
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:17,043
suspending it over the street
between these two lampposts.

908
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:19,917
Meanwhile, we've outfitted
the time vehicle...

909
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:22,014
with this big pole
and hook...

910
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:25,788
which runs directly
into the flux capacitor.

911
01:09:25,861 --> 01:09:28,261
At the calculated moment...

912
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:30,355
you start off
from down the street...

913
01:09:30,432 --> 01:09:34,027
driving directly toward the cable,
accelerating to 88 miles per hour.

914
01:09:35,304 --> 01:09:37,636
According to the flyer,
at precisely 10:04 p. M...

915
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:40,106
this Saturday night, lightning
will strike the clock tower...

916
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:42,110
electrifying the cable...

917
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:44,578
just as the connecting hook
makes contact...

918
01:09:44,647 --> 01:09:47,707
thereby sending 1.21 gigawatts
into the flux capacitor...

919
01:09:47,783 --> 01:09:50,308
and sending you back to 1985.

920
01:09:50,386 --> 01:09:52,752
<i>All right, now.</i>
<i>Watch this.</i>

921
01:09:52,821 --> 01:09:54,982
You wind up the car
and release it.

922
01:09:56,058 --> 01:09:58,026
I'll simulate the lightning.

923
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:07,825
Ready.

924
01:10:17,913 --> 01:10:20,746
Set.

925
01:10:22,851 --> 01:10:24,819
Release.

926
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:46,138
<i>You're instilling me</i>
<i>with a lot of confidence, Doc.</i>

927
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:49,644
Don't worry. I'll take care of ideas.
You take care of your pop.

928
01:10:51,547 --> 01:10:54,482
By the way, what happened today?
Did he ask her out?

929
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:57,075
- I think so.
- What did she say?

930
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:07,529
It's your mom!
She's tracked you down!

931
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:10,622
<i>Quick! Let's cover</i>
<i>the time machine.</i>

932
01:11:22,911 --> 01:11:25,607
Hi, Mar... Cal... Marty.

933
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:27,615
Mom... Lorraine.

934
01:11:27,683 --> 01:11:30,675
Uh, how did you know
I was here?

935
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:34,687
I followed you.

936
01:11:34,757 --> 01:11:36,918
Oh, uh, this is my,
uh, Doc... My uncle...

937
01:11:36,992 --> 01:11:40,428
<i>Doc... Brown.</i>

938
01:11:40,496 --> 01:11:42,464
- Hi.
- Hi.

939
01:11:42,531 --> 01:11:45,159
Uh...

940
01:11:45,234 --> 01:11:48,567
Marty, this may seem
a little forward...

941
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:51,800
but I was kind of
wondering if...

942
01:11:51,874 --> 01:11:54,672
I-if you'd ask me to the...

943
01:11:54,743 --> 01:11:57,712
Enchantment Under The Sea dance
on Saturday?

944
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:01,249
Uh, you mean...

945
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:03,410
You mean nobody's asked you?

946
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:05,453
No.

947
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:07,921
Not yet.

948
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:11,585
- What about... What about George?
- George McFly?

949
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:18,767
Oh, he... He's kind of cute and all,
but, uh, not...

950
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:20,859
Well...

951
01:12:20,936 --> 01:12:23,200
I think a man
should be strong...

952
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:27,142
so he can
stand up for himself...

953
01:12:28,444 --> 01:12:30,378
and protect
the woman he loves.

954
01:12:34,483 --> 01:12:36,610
Don't you?

955
01:12:37,619 --> 01:12:39,553
Yeah.

956
01:12:39,621 --> 01:12:41,919
I still don't understand.

957
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:44,584
How am I supposed to go
to the dance with her...

958
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:47,561
if she's already going
to the dance with you?

959
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:50,621
Well, because, George,
she <i>wants</i> to go with you.

960
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:52,633
She just doesn't
know it yet.

961
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:55,602
That's why we gotta show her that you,
George McFly, are a fighter.

962
01:12:55,671 --> 01:12:57,605
You're somebody who's gonna
stand up for yourself...

963
01:12:57,673 --> 01:12:59,607
somebody who's
gonna protect her.

964
01:12:59,675 --> 01:13:02,143
Yeah, but I've never
picked a fight in my entire life.

965
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:05,339
Look, you're not gonna be
picking a fight, Dad...

966
01:13:05,414 --> 01:13:07,678
dad-dad-daddio.

967
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:09,980
You're coming
to her rescue, right?

968
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:12,919
Okay, let's go over the plan again.
8:55, where you gonna be?

969
01:13:12,988 --> 01:13:15,957
- I'm gonna be at the dance.
- Right. And where am I gonna be?

970
01:13:16,024 --> 01:13:18,083
You're gonna be
in the car with her.

971
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:21,095
Right, so around 9:00,
she's gonna get very angry with me.

972
01:13:21,163 --> 01:13:23,631
Why is she gonna
get angry with you?

973
01:13:23,699 --> 01:13:25,929
Well, because, George,
nice girls get angry...

974
01:13:26,001 --> 01:13:28,561
when guys
take advantage of them.

975
01:13:28,637 --> 01:13:32,471
Oh! You mean you're gonna
go touch her on her...

976
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:35,840
No. No, George, look.

977
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:38,209
It's just an act, right?

978
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:42,410
Okay. So, 9:00, you're strolling
through the parking lot.

979
01:13:42,484 --> 01:13:45,544
You see us, uh,
struggling in the car.

980
01:13:45,621 --> 01:13:48,784
You walk up, you open
the door and you say...

981
01:13:50,492 --> 01:13:53,325
Your line, George.

982
01:13:53,395 --> 01:13:55,329
Oh! Uh...

983
01:13:55,397 --> 01:13:58,730
Hey, you, get your
damn hands off her!

984
01:14:00,402 --> 01:14:02,870
- You really think I oughta swear?
- Yes, definitely.

985
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:04,872
Goddamn it, George, swear.

986
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:07,909
Okay. So now you come up.
You punch me in the stomach.

987
01:14:07,976 --> 01:14:09,910
I'm out for the count,
right?

988
01:14:09,978 --> 01:14:13,072
And you and Lorraine
live happily ever after.

989
01:14:13,148 --> 01:14:15,514
Oh, you make it sound
so easy.

990
01:14:15,584 --> 01:14:17,575
I just...
I wish I wasn't so scared.

991
01:14:17,653 --> 01:14:19,587
George, there's nothing
to be scared of.

992
01:14:19,655 --> 01:14:21,748
All it takes is a little
self-confidence.

993
01:14:21,824 --> 01:14:24,759
You know, if you
put your mind to it...

994
01:14:24,827 --> 01:14:26,988
you can accomplish anything.

995
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:31,290
<i>Hill Valley</i>
<i>area weather this Saturday night.</i>

996
01:14:31,366 --> 01:14:34,199
<i>Mostly clear,</i>
<i>with some scattered clouds.</i>

997
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:36,203
<i>Lows tonight</i>
<i>in the upper 40s...</i>

998
01:14:36,271 --> 01:14:38,865
Are you sure
about this storm?

999
01:14:38,941 --> 01:14:43,469
Since when can weathermen predict
the weather, let alone the future?

1000
01:14:43,545 --> 01:14:45,740
You know, Marty, I'm gonna
be very sad to see you go.

1001
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:47,748
You've really made
a difference in my life.

1002
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:49,807
You've given me
something to shoot for.

1003
01:14:49,885 --> 01:14:54,049
Just knowing that I'm gonna
be around to see 1985...

1004
01:14:54,122 --> 01:14:56,056
that I'm gonna succeed
in this...

1005
01:14:56,124 --> 01:14:58,183
that I'm gonna have a chance
to travel through time!

1006
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:07,634
It's gonna be really hard waiting
30 years before I can talk to you...

1007
01:15:07,703 --> 01:15:10,831
about everything that's happened
in the past few days.

1008
01:15:10,906 --> 01:15:14,205
I'm really gonna
miss you, Marty.

1009
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:16,210
I'm really gonna miss you.

1010
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:23,951
- Doc, about the future...
- No!

1011
01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:27,250
Marty, we've already agreed that
having information about the future...

1012
01:15:27,322 --> 01:15:29,256
can be extremely dangerous.

1013
01:15:29,324 --> 01:15:33,317
Even if your intentions are good,
it can backfire drastically.

1014
01:15:33,395 --> 01:15:35,363
Whatever you've got
to tell me...

1015
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:38,422
I'll find out through
the natural course of time.

1016
01:15:39,568 --> 01:15:42,196
"Dear Dr. Brown...

1017
01:15:42,271 --> 01:15:45,138
on the night that
I go back in time...

1018
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:47,471
you will be...

1019
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:50,876
shot by terrorists.

1020
01:15:50,946 --> 01:15:53,380
Please take whatever
precautions are necessary...

1021
01:15:53,448 --> 01:15:55,439
to prevent
this terrible disaster.

1022
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:59,851
Your friend...

1023
01:15:59,922 --> 01:16:01,856
Marty."

1024
01:16:10,799 --> 01:16:13,734
Evening, Dr. Brown.
What's with the wire?

1025
01:16:13,802 --> 01:16:16,737
Oh, just a little
weather experiment.

1026
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:20,633
- Whatcha got under here?
- No, no! Don't touch that!

1027
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:23,735
Some new, specialized
weather-sensing equipment.

1028
01:16:23,812 --> 01:16:25,780
You, uh, got a permit for that?

1029
01:16:25,847 --> 01:16:27,838
Of course I do.

1030
01:16:34,756 --> 01:16:37,623
Just a second. Let me see if
I can find it here.

1031
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:32,375
Do you mind if we...

1032
01:17:32,447 --> 01:17:35,348
park... for a while?

1033
01:17:35,417 --> 01:17:38,716
- That's a great idea. I'd love to park.
- Huh?

1034
01:17:38,787 --> 01:17:41,347
Marty, I'm almost
18 years old.

1035
01:17:41,423 --> 01:17:43,357
It's not like I've never
parked before.

1036
01:17:44,526 --> 01:17:46,460
What?

1037
01:17:46,528 --> 01:17:49,463
Marty, you seem so nervous.
Is something wrong?

1038
01:17:49,531 --> 01:17:51,556
No.

1039
01:17:51,633 --> 01:17:53,828
No.

1040
01:17:57,406 --> 01:18:00,341
Lorraine, Lorraine,
what are you doin'?

1041
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:02,843
I swiped it from
the old lady's liquor cabinet.

1042
01:18:02,911 --> 01:18:05,744
Yeah, well,
you shouldn't drink.

1043
01:18:05,814 --> 01:18:08,442
- Why not?
- Because you...

1044
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:11,884
You might regret it
later in life.

1045
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:13,887
Marty, don't be such a square.

1046
01:18:13,955 --> 01:18:16,719
<i>Everybody who's anybody drinks.</i>

1047
01:18:21,797 --> 01:18:24,493
Geez, you smoke too?

1048
01:18:24,566 --> 01:18:26,659
Marty, you're beginning
to sound just like my mother.

1049
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:41,414
We're gonna take a little break,
but we'll be back in a while...

1050
01:18:41,483 --> 01:18:44,145
so, uh, don't nobody go nowhere.

1051
01:19:00,936 --> 01:19:04,167
Marty?
Why are you so nervous?

1052
01:19:05,173 --> 01:19:07,403
Lorraine...

1053
01:19:07,476 --> 01:19:09,637
have you ever...

1054
01:19:09,711 --> 01:19:13,909
uh, been in a situation where you
knew you had to act a certain way...

1055
01:19:13,982 --> 01:19:17,383
but when you got there, you didn't
know if you could go through with it?

1056
01:19:17,452 --> 01:19:20,216
Oh, you mean like how you're
supposed to act on a first date?

1057
01:19:20,288 --> 01:19:23,348
Oh, uh, sort of.

1058
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:27,828
- I... I think I know
exactly what you mean.
- Y-You do?

1059
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:31,660
You know what I do
in those situations?

1060
01:19:31,733 --> 01:19:34,031
- What?
- I don't worry.

1061
01:19:51,386 --> 01:19:53,320

it's like I'm kissing...

1064
01:20:01,763 --> 01:20:03,697
my brother.

1065
01:20:03,765 --> 01:20:06,893

1066
01:20:06,968 --> 01:20:09,095
Believe me.

1067
01:20:09,171 --> 01:20:11,105
It makes perfect sense.

1068
01:20:11,173 --> 01:20:13,198
Somebody's coming.

1069
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:22,446
You caused 300 bucks' damage to my car,
you son of a bitch...

1070
01:20:22,517 --> 01:20:24,451
and I'm gonna take it
outta your ass.

1071
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:26,453
Hold him.

1072
01:20:26,521 --> 01:20:29,285
Let him go, Biff.
You're drunk.

1073
01:20:29,357 --> 01:20:32,224
Well, lookee
what we have here.

1074
01:20:35,263 --> 01:20:39,097
No, no! Stay right here with me.
Come on, Lorraine.

1075
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:41,101
- <i>Let me go!</i>
- Leave her alone, you bastard!

1076
01:20:41,169 --> 01:20:43,467
You guys, take him in back.
I'll be right there.

1077

This ain't no peep show.

1079
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:57,914
- Hey, let's put him in there.
- Yeah!

1080
01:20:59,654 --> 01:21:01,645
That's for messing up my hair.

1081
01:21:01,723 --> 01:21:03,816
What the hell
are you doing to my car?

1082
01:21:03,892 --> 01:21:06,053
Hey, beat it, spook.
This don't concern you.

1083

peckerwood?

1084

1085
01:21:15,136 --> 01:21:17,331
Look, I don't wanna mess

1086
01:21:17,405 --> 01:21:19,464
Get home to your mama, boy.

1087
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:21,566
Biff! Biff! Hurry, Biff!

1088
01:21:21,643 --> 01:21:23,770

1090
01:21:25,847 --> 01:21:27,781
Reginald, where are your keys?

1091
01:21:27,849 --> 01:21:30,147
<i>The keys are in the trunk.</i>

1092
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:33,244
- Say that again?
- <i>I said the keys are in here.</i>

1093
01:21:37,192 --> 01:21:39,524
Let me go!

1094
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:48,669
<i>Come on!</i>

1095
01:21:50,472 --> 01:21:54,033
Hey, you,
get your damn hands off...

1096
01:21:54,109 --> 01:21:55,974
Oh.

1097
01:21:56,044 --> 01:21:58,205
I think you got
the wrong car, McFly.

1098
01:21:59,714 --> 01:22:02,308
George, help me! Please!

1099
01:22:02,384 --> 01:22:06,650
Just turn around, McFly,
and walk away.

1100
01:22:06,721 --> 01:22:08,484
- Please, George.
- Are you deaf, McFly?

1101
01:22:08,556 --> 01:22:10,649
<i>Close the door and beat it.</i>

1102
01:22:13,361 --> 01:22:16,990
No, Biff.
You leave her alone.

1103
01:22:17,065 --> 01:22:19,625
All right, McFly.

1104
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:24,762
You're asking for it...

1105
01:22:24,839 --> 01:22:27,034
and now you're gonna get it.

1106
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:30,271
Stop it!

1107
01:22:30,345 --> 01:22:32,279
Biff, you'll break his arm!

1108
01:22:33,882 --> 01:22:35,873
Biff, no!

1109
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:38,442
Gimme a hand here, Reginald.

1110
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:41,546
Ow! Damn it, man!
I sliced my hand!

1111
01:22:41,623 --> 01:22:43,557
- Whose are these?
- Mine.

1112
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:45,752
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

1113
01:22:46,761 --> 01:22:49,059
You're gonna break his arm!

1114
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:52,964
Biff! Biff, leave him alone!

1115
01:22:53,034 --> 01:22:55,332
Let him go! Let him go!

1116
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:29,603
Are you okay?

1117
01:23:50,058 --> 01:23:52,049
Who is that guy?

1118
01:23:52,127 --> 01:23:54,061
That's George McFly.

1119
01:23:57,799 --> 01:24:00,597
- That's George McFly?
- Excuse me.

1120
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:13,714
The storm.

1121
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:17,912
Hey, guys, you gotta get back
in there and finish the dance.

1122
01:24:17,986 --> 01:24:19,920
Hey, man,
look at Marvin's hand.

1123
01:24:19,988 --> 01:24:22,456
He can't play with this hand like that,
and we can't play without him.

1124
01:24:22,524 --> 01:24:24,719
Yeah, well, look, Marvin,
you gotta play.

1125
01:24:24,793 --> 01:24:26,727
See, that's where they kiss for
the first time on the dance floor...

1126
01:24:26,795 --> 01:24:28,729
and if there's no music,
they can't dance.

1127
01:24:28,797 --> 01:24:30,731
And if they can't dance,
they can't kiss.

1128
01:24:30,799 --> 01:24:32,733
If they can't kiss, they can't
fall in love, and I'm history.

1129
01:24:32,801 --> 01:24:36,430
The dance is over, unless you know
somebody else that can play the guitar.

1130
01:24:43,945 --> 01:24:46,379
This is for
all you lovers out there.

in that... that zoot suit?

1216
01:31:43,464 --> 01:31:45,489
The old man really came through.
It worked.

1217
01:31:45,566 --> 01:31:48,797
He laid out Biff in one punch.
I didn't know he had it in him.

1218
01:31:48,870 --> 01:31:51,304
He's never stood up
to Biff in his life.

1219
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:56,942
- Never?
- No. Why? What's the matter?

1220
01:31:57,011 --> 01:31:58,945
All right!

1221
01:31:59,013 --> 01:32:01,106
Let's set your destination time.

1222
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:09,148
This is the exact time you left.

1223
01:32:09,223 --> 01:32:12,158
Let's send you back
at exactly the same time.

1224
01:32:15,263 --> 01:32:17,322
It'll be like you never left.

1225
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:21,660
Now, I painted a white line
on the street...

1226
01:32:21,736 --> 01:32:23,670
way over there.

1227
01:32:23,738 --> 01:32:25,672
That's where
you'll start from.

1228
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:27,833
I've calculated
the precise distance...

1229
01:32:27,909 --> 01:32:31,367
taking into account the acceleration
speed and wind resistance...

1230
01:32:31,445 --> 01:32:34,812
retroactive from the moment
the lightning strikes...

1231
01:32:34,882 --> 01:32:40,047
which will be in exactly
7 minutes and 22 seconds.

1232
01:32:40,121 --> 01:32:42,487
When this alarm goes off,
you hit the gas.

1233
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:44,491
Right.

1234
01:32:50,431 --> 01:32:53,628
Well, I guess
that's everything.

1235
01:32:57,605 --> 01:33:00,039
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

1236
01:33:05,379 --> 01:33:07,347
See you in about 30 years.

1237
01:33:09,150 --> 01:33:11,084
I hope so.

1238
01:33:12,353 --> 01:33:14,378
Don't worry!

1239
01:33:14,455 --> 01:33:16,389
<i>As long as you</i>
<i>hit that wire...</i>

1240
01:33:16,457 --> 01:33:19,255
with the connecting hook
at precisely 88 miles an hour...

1241
01:33:19,327 --> 01:33:22,262
the instant the lightning
strikes the tower...

1242
01:33:24,365 --> 01:33:26,356
everything will be fine.

1243
01:33:26,434 --> 01:33:28,800
All right.

1244
01:33:35,676 --> 01:33:39,908
- What's the meaning of this?
- You'll find out in 30 years.

1245
01:33:39,981 --> 01:33:42,108
It's about the future,
isn't it?

1246
01:33:42,183 --> 01:33:44,845
- It's information about the future!
- Wait a minute!

1247
01:33:44,919 --> 01:33:46,978
I warned you
about this, kid.

1248
01:33:47,054 --> 01:33:49,921
The consequences
could be disastrous!

1249
01:33:49,991 --> 01:33:52,391
Doc, that's a risk
you're gonna have to take.

1250
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:55,224
- Your life depends on it!
- No!

1251
01:33:55,296 --> 01:33:59,198
I refuse to accept
the responsibility.

1252
01:33:59,266 --> 01:34:02,997
- In that case,
I'll tell you straight out!

1253
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:07,674
Great Scott!

1254
01:34:15,416 --> 01:34:18,544
You get the cable!
I'll throw the rope down to you!

1255
01:34:18,619 --> 01:34:21,213
Right! I got it!

1256
01:34:51,552 --> 01:34:53,486
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1257
01:34:53,554 --> 01:34:55,283
Doc!

1258
01:35:03,397 --> 01:35:08,528
- Come on, come on. Let's go!
- All right! Take it up!

1259
01:35:10,137 --> 01:35:11,536
Go!

1260
01:35:19,146 --> 01:35:21,273
- Doc!
- Huh?

1261
01:35:21,348 --> 01:35:24,749
I have to tell you
about the future!

1262
01:35:24,819 --> 01:35:29,256
- What?
- I have to tell you about the future!

1263
01:35:29,323 --> 01:35:30,654
What?

1264
01:35:30,725 --> 01:35:35,719
On the night I go
back in time, you get...

1265
01:35:35,796 --> 01:35:37,525
Oh!

1266
01:35:38,933 --> 01:35:41,128
Doc!

1267
01:35:46,173 --> 01:35:49,040
Oh!

1268
01:35:49,110 --> 01:35:51,305
Go!

1269
01:35:51,378 --> 01:35:53,972
- No, Doc!
- Look at the time!

1270
01:35:54,048 --> 01:35:56,107
You've got less than
four minutes.

1271
01:35:56,183 --> 01:35:58,276
<i>Please, hurry!</i>

1272
01:36:09,497 --> 01:36:11,431
Yeah!

1273
01:37:04,418 --> 01:37:07,717
Damn it, Doc! Why did you
have to tear up that letter?

1274
01:37:07,788 --> 01:37:09,756
If I only had more time.

1275
01:37:12,626 --> 01:37:15,026
Wait a minute.
I got all the time I want.

1276
01:37:15,095 --> 01:37:18,656
I got a time machine.
I can just go back early and warn him.

1277
01:37:18,732 --> 01:37:20,723
Okay. Ten minutes
ought to do it.

1278
01:37:22,970 --> 01:37:28,704
<i>- Okay. Time circuit's on.</i>
<i>- Fluxing.</i>

1279
01:37:28,776 --> 01:37:30,869
Engine running.
All right.

1280
01:37:33,581 --> 01:37:35,515
No. No, no, no, no.

1281
01:37:35,583 --> 01:37:37,517
Come on. Come on.

1282
01:37:37,585 --> 01:37:39,553
Not this time.
Come on, come on.

1283
01:38:48,622 --> 01:38:50,613
Come on.

1284
01:38:53,193 --> 01:38:55,923
Here we go. Here we go.
This time. Come on.

1285
01:38:57,364 --> 01:39:01,027
Please. Please.
Come on!

1286
01:40:38,665 --> 01:40:40,030
Doc.

1287
01:41:28,582 --> 01:41:32,518
Yeah! Ha-ha!

1288
01:41:57,511 --> 01:42:00,878
# We searched
all through the night # #

1289
01:42:16,930 --> 01:42:19,296
Crazy drunk driver.

1290
01:42:28,876 --> 01:42:30,844
Whoo!

1291
01:42:33,113 --> 01:42:35,775
<i>All right. Oh, Red.</i>

1292
01:42:37,284 --> 01:42:40,117
You look great.
Everything looks great.

1293
01:42:40,187 --> 01:42:42,246
<i>1:24.</i>

1294
01:42:42,322 --> 01:42:45,223
I still got time.
I'm comin', Doc!

1295
01:42:47,294 --> 01:42:51,390
No! No, not again!

1296
01:42:51,465 --> 01:42:54,525
Come on! Come on!

1297
01:42:59,506 --> 01:43:01,440
Hey!

1298
01:43:07,181 --> 01:43:09,115
Libyans.

1299
01:43:31,805 --> 01:43:36,265
<i>No! You bastard!</i>

1300
01:43:48,121 --> 01:43:49,952
<i>Go!</i>

1301
01:44:24,358 --> 01:44:27,691
Doc! Doc!

1302
01:44:32,299 --> 01:44:34,767
Oh, no!

1303
01:44:48,915 --> 01:44:50,883
You're alive.

1304
01:44:59,059 --> 01:45:01,823
Bulletproof vest?

1305
01:45:01,895 --> 01:45:03,863
How did you know?

1306
01:45:04,998 --> 01:45:07,967
<i>L- I never got a chance</i>
<i>to tell you.</i>

1307
01:45:21,315 --> 01:45:25,342
What about all that talk
about screwing up future events?

1308
01:45:25,419 --> 01:45:27,353
The space-time continuum?

1309
01:45:27,421 --> 01:45:31,016
Well, I figured,
what the hell.

1310
01:45:40,901 --> 01:45:42,835
So how far ahead
are you going?

1311
01:45:42,903 --> 01:45:46,100
About 30 years.
It's a nice round number.

1312
01:45:46,173 --> 01:45:48,334
Look me up when you get there,
all right?

1313
01:45:48,408 --> 01:45:50,467
Guess I'll be about 47.

1314
01:45:50,544 --> 01:45:52,478
I will.

1315
01:45:52,546 --> 01:45:55,242
- Take care.
- You too.

1316
01:45:55,315 --> 01:45:58,580
Right. Bye-bye, Einie.

1317
01:45:58,652 --> 01:46:00,586
<i>Oh, and watch that reentry.</i>

1318
01:46:00,654 --> 01:46:03,020
- <i>It's a little bumpy.</i>
- You bet.

1319
01:46:41,862 --> 01:46:43,989
# Take me away #

1320
01:46:44,064 --> 01:46:46,225
# I don't mind #

1321
01:46:46,299 --> 01:46:50,258
# Just better promise me
I'll be back in time #

1322
01:46:53,774 --> 01:46:55,765
<i># Gotta get back in time #</i>

1323
01:46:57,344 --> 01:46:59,835
<i># Gotta get back in time #</i>

1324
01:47:01,415 --> 01:47:03,508
# Get me back in time # #

1325
01:47:08,855 --> 01:47:11,483
What a nightmare.

1326
01:47:21,701 --> 01:47:24,966
<i>If Paul calls me, tell him I'm</i>
<i>working at the boutique late tonight.</i>

1327
01:47:25,038 --> 01:47:27,097
<i>Linda, first of all,</i>
<i>I'm not your answering service.</i>

1328
01:47:27,174 --> 01:47:30,575
<i>Second of all,</i>
<i>somebody named Greg or Craig</i>
<i>called you just a little while ago.</i>

1329
01:47:30,644 --> 01:47:32,839
- Which one was it, Greg or Craig?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

1330
01:47:32,913 --> 01:47:35,643
- <i>I can't keep up</i>
<i>with all of your boyfriends.</i>
- Hey.

1331
01:47:37,284 --> 01:47:41,015
- <i>What the hell is this?</i>
- Breakfast.

1332
01:47:41,087 --> 01:47:43,749
<i>What, did you sleep</i>
<i>in your clothes again?</i>

1333
01:47:43,824 --> 01:47:46,224
Yeah. L...

1334
01:47:46,293 --> 01:47:48,591
Yeah. What are...
What are you wearing, Dave?

1335
01:47:48,662 --> 01:47:52,496
Marty, I always wear
a suit to the office.

1336
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:55,568
- <i>You all right?</i>
- Yeah.

1337
01:47:55,635 --> 01:47:57,762
<i>I think we need a rematch, George.</i>

1338
01:47:57,838 --> 01:48:00,534
- A rematch? Why? Were you cheating?
- No.

1339
01:48:00,607 --> 01:48:03,007
- Hello.
- Good morning.

1340
01:48:04,244 --> 01:48:06,007
Mom! Dad!

1341
01:48:06,079 --> 01:48:08,741
- Wh... Did you hit your head?
- Marty, are you all right?

1342
01:48:08,815 --> 01:48:12,478
You guys... You guys look great.
Mom, you look so thin.

1343
01:48:12,552 --> 01:48:15,043
Why, thank you, Marty.
George!

1344
01:48:16,089 --> 01:48:18,080
Good morning, sleepyhead.

1345
01:48:19,659 --> 01:48:22,184
- <i>Good morning, Dave. Linda.</i>
<i>- Good morning, Mom.</i>

1346
01:48:22,262 --> 01:48:25,095
<i>Marty, I almost forgot.</i>
<i>Jennifer Parker called.</i>

1347
01:48:25,165 --> 01:48:28,794
I sure like her, Marty.
She is such a sweet girl.

1348
01:48:28,869 --> 01:48:30,860
Isn't tonight
the night of the big date?

1349
01:48:30,937 --> 01:48:32,802
What? What, Ma?

1350
01:48:32,873 --> 01:48:36,741
Aren't you going up to the lake?
You've been planning it for two weeks.

1351
01:48:36,810 --> 01:48:38,971
Mom, we talked about this.

1352
01:48:39,045 --> 01:48:41,036
How can I go to the lake?
The car's wrecked.

1353
01:48:41,114 --> 01:48:43,241
- Wrecked?
- Wrecked?

1354
01:48:43,316 --> 01:48:45,375
- What happened?
- When did this happen?

1355
01:48:45,452 --> 01:48:49,445
- <i>I'm sure the car is fine.</i>
- <i>Why am I always the last one</i>
<i>to know about these things?</i>

1356
01:48:49,523 --> 01:48:51,923
<i>See? There's Biff out there</i>
<i>waxing it right now.</i>

1357
01:48:51,992 --> 01:48:56,895
Biff, I want to make sure we get two
coats of wax this time, not just one.

1358
01:48:56,963 --> 01:48:58,897
I'm just finishing up
the second coat now.

1359
01:48:58,965 --> 01:49:01,229
Now, Biff, don't con me.

1360
01:49:02,769 --> 01:49:04,703
I'm... I'm sorry,
Mr. McFly.

1361
01:49:04,771 --> 01:49:08,229
I meant I was just starting
on the second coat.

1362
01:49:08,308 --> 01:49:11,004
Ah, Biff.
What a character.

1363
01:49:11,077 --> 01:49:13,341
<i>Always trying to get away</i>
<i>with something.</i>

1364
01:49:13,413 --> 01:49:16,610
<i>I've had to stay on top of Biff</i>
<i>ever since high school.</i>

1365
01:49:16,683 --> 01:49:18,674
<i>Although,</i>
<i>if it wasn't for him...</i>

1366
01:49:18,752 --> 01:49:22,518
- We never would have fallen in love.
- That's right.

1367
01:49:22,589 --> 01:49:25,149
Mr. McFly! Mr. McFly,
this just arrived.

1368
01:49:25,225 --> 01:49:27,921
Oh, hi, Marty.
I think it's your new book.

1369
01:49:29,996 --> 01:49:31,930
Oh, honey!

1370
01:49:31,998 --> 01:49:34,228
Your first novel.

1371
01:49:34,301 --> 01:49:37,429
<i>Like I've always told you,</i>
<i>you put your mind to it...</i>

1372
01:49:37,504 --> 01:49:41,531
- you can accomplish anything.
- Oh, Marty, here's your keys.

1373
01:49:41,608 --> 01:49:43,576
You're all waxed up,
ready for tonight.

1374
01:49:43,643 --> 01:49:45,702
Keys?

1375
01:50:00,794 --> 01:50:02,728
How about a ride, mister?

1376
01:50:02,796 --> 01:50:07,790
Jennifer! Oh, are you
a sight for sore eyes.

1377
01:50:07,867 --> 01:50:09,801
Let me look at you.

1378
01:50:09,869 --> 01:50:12,770
Marty, you're acting like
you haven't seen me in a week.

1379
01:50:12,839 --> 01:50:14,773
I haven't.

1380
01:50:14,841 --> 01:50:16,832
You okay?

1381
01:50:16,910 --> 01:50:18,844
Is everything all right?

1382
01:50:20,146 --> 01:50:22,580
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

1383
01:50:24,884 --> 01:50:26,818
Everything is great.

1384
01:50:40,900 --> 01:50:44,802
Marty! You've gotta
come back with me!

1385
01:50:45,939 --> 01:50:48,203
- Where?
- Back to the future.

1386
01:50:52,012 --> 01:50:54,674
Wait a minute.
What are you doin', Doc?

1387
01:50:54,748 --> 01:50:56,841
I need fuel.

1388
01:51:00,687 --> 01:51:03,121
Go ahead. Quick!
Get in the car.

1389
01:51:03,189 --> 01:51:06,124
No, no. I just got here,
okay? Jennifer's here.

1390
01:51:06,192 --> 01:51:08,217
<i>We're gonna take the new truck</i>
<i>for a spin.</i>

1391
01:51:08,294 --> 01:51:10,956
Well, bring her along.
This concerns her too.

1392
01:51:11,031 --> 01:51:14,558
What are you talking about?
What happens to us in the future?

1393
01:51:14,634 --> 01:51:17,432
- Do we become assholes or something?
- No, no, no, no, Marty.

1394
01:51:17,504 --> 01:51:20,701
Both you and Jennifer turn out fine.
It's your kids, Marty.

1395
01:51:20,774 --> 01:51:23,072
Something has gotta be done
about your kids.

1396
01:51:29,382 --> 01:51:32,715
Hey, Doc, we better back up. We don't
have enough road to get up to 88.

1397
01:51:32,786 --> 01:51:36,916
Roads? Where we're going,
we don't need roads.

1398
01:52:04,384 --> 01:52:05,874
