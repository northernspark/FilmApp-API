2
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:47,096
Keep that horn going.

3
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:54,106
Ten fathoms by the mark, sir.

4
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,039
Hoist your pilot signal lights.

5
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,276
Hoist your pilot signal lights.

6
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,780
Haul down your jibs.

7
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:04,614
Haul down your jibs.

8
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:13,495
By the deep eight and a sandy bottom, sir.

9
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,162
- Stand by the anchor.
- Aye, sir. Standing by.

10
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:21,239
Right ahead, sir.

11
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:28,204
- I see it. Right over there.
- We're here, boys!

12
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,110
Ahoy!

13
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:35,449
Be quiet down there.

14

15
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:45,095
220 days out of New York...

16
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:48,463
...and 15 days trying to find
your blasted harbor.

17
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:51,836
Nobody asked you to come.

18
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:55,772
You got anything
in this hog-end of the world except fog?

19
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:00,378
Sure! We've got gold, mountains of gold!

20
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,580
What are our chances?

21
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:09,485
You're just in time. We're all humpbacked
carrying nuggets around.

22
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:15,756
- Where are you going, Jerry?
- To the promised land!

23
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:19,863
Man overboard!

24
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,965
Pilot boat, ahoy!
Man overboard! Please pick him up!

25
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:33,142
There they are at last, Miss Rutledge.
The will-o'-the-wisp lights of fortune.

26
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:36,545
San Francisco,
the latest newborn of a great republic.

27
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:40,085
I see a lot of fog and a few lights.

28
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:42,545
I like it when life's hidden.

29
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,889
It gives you a chance to imagine nice things.

30
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,055
Nicer than they are.

31
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:52,353
Listen to them.

32
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,960
Men like to yell, don't they?

33
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:57,669
They imagine they're millionaires already.

34
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:01,398
More than that.
They've all left lives behind they didn't like.

35
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:04,271
They all dream of being reborn
in the new land.

36
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:07,039
Do they? Or do they dream of gold?

37
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,412
No, Miss Rutledge.

38
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,775
Behind that fog lies
not only sand filled with gold...

39
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:14,682
...but a new empire for men of vision.

40
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:18,154
Men of vision! I love the fine names
men give each other...

41
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,386
...to hide their greed
and lust for adventure.

42
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:24,454
I am amazed at your idealism, Col. Cobb.

43
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:27,997
Newspaper men are either drunkards
or idealists, Miss Rutledge.

44
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,864
I'm afraid I'm both.

45
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,536
However soiled his hands...

46
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:34,971
...the journalist goes staggering
through life with the beacon raised.

47
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:39,135
Beg pardon, but there's not much time
to pay for your clearance papers.

48
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:41,770
Nobody will be allowed off ship
until they do.

49
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:44,247
- How much is it?
- $45.

50
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,248
Tell the purser I'll settle
before the ship leaves the port.

51
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:50,447
Sorry, but there'll be no going ashore
unless it's paid.

52
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:54,993
Here, young man, you get our luggage
and a boat to take us ashore.

53
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:56,789
Yes, sir, thank you.

54
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,523
Thank you, Colonel, I...

55
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:04,569
A paltry sum to unlock the golden gates of
that new empire that lies behind the fog.

56
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:09,937
Miss Rutledge, you'll pardon an old man
for interfering, but I'd like to help you.

57
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:13,501
San Francisco is no place
for so fair a flower as yourself.

58
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:16,579
Thank you for your offer of protection,
Col. Cobb...

59
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,851
...but I don't think I shall need it.

60
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:21,476
- Are you ready with the anchor?
- Aye, sir.

61
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,452
- Let her go!
- Aye, sir!

62
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,320
We're in, Colonel.

63
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:31,657
Boat's alongside, sir. This way.

64
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:41,133
Will you step aside please
and let the lady get in here?

65
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,142
Sufferin' snakes! A white woman!

66
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,373
How much to take us ashore?

67
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:56,218
- $50 apiece, in advance.
- $50? Why that's outrageous!

68
00:05:57,156 --> 00:06:00,751
This is New Year's Eve, folks,
and them's New Year's Eve prices.

69
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:05,396
- I know, but...
- Colonel, it'll be paid when we get ashore.

70
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:09,660
Jumpin' Jehoshaphat! A white woman!

71
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,302
What is the matter, my man, tired?

72
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:24,349
Tired? Say, I could row from here to China
and back again without even puffin'.

73
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,351
- Then why the delay?
- It's after 10:00 p.m.

74
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,915
I don't get the significance of your remark.

75
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,147
After 10:00, the rates go up.

76
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:37,859
A blackmailer at the gates of El Dorado.
Why, it's preposterous.

77
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:41,627
Pay or get out.
And the proposition goes for you too, miss.

78
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,999
- We are hardly in a position to walk.
- Try swimming.

79
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,262
But I haven't that much money!

80
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:49,933
Over you go then, both of you.
Business is business.

81
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:52,738
- You wouldn't dare!
- I wouldn't dare?

82
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:56,138
You don't think they call me
"Old Atrocity" for nothin', do you?

83
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,275
If I was to tell you the atrocities
I've committed in my time...

84
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:00,784
...you'd keel over.

85
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:04,118
Another thing,
there's a price on my head in every state...

86
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:07,386
...except in the Californy,
and it ain't organized yet.

87
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,324
Upsy-daisy, over you go, no foolin'.

88
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,059
Wait. Does it mean anything to you
that I came here to marry Dan Morgan?

89
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,896
- Marry Dan Morgan?
- Yes.

90
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,764
The man that made the Homestead Gully strike?

91
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:19,963
Yes.

92
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:23,671
Moses in the mountain.

93
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,438
Here comes one.

94
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:32,684
- Who you got there?
- A new white woman.

95
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:33,877
You're lyin'!

96
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,518
No, I ain't. She's a New York white
woman. Whiter than a hen's egg.

97
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,895
Be careful with her.

98
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,340
Give her room boys,
she ain't gonna disappear.

99
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:59,673
- Welcome to San Francisco, miss.
- Thank you, sir.

100
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:03,982
Happy New Year
to the gentlemen of San Francisco.

101
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:07,280
On behalf of the assembled multitude,
allow me to wish you likewise.

102
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:08,717
That's right and many of them.

103
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,551
Thank you. Would someone
please help Col. Cobb up?

104
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,182
I'd swim with my hands tied if you ask it.

105
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,659
Up you come to San Francisco, partner.

106
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:19,627
Col. Marcus Aurelius Cobb is the name,
gentlemen.

107
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,700
That's fine. Anything we can do for you?

108
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:24,065
- If you're chilly, have my coat.
- Mine's newer.

109
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,866
- Are you hungry?
- You can have me roasted, boiled or fried.

110
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:30,636
- Find something better than monkey meat.
- Bella Donna serves the best steaks.

111
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:33,803
Thank you, gentlemen,
but I came here to meet Mr. Dan Morgan.

112
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,847
Does anyone know where he is?

113
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,653
She's Dan Morgan's fiancée.

114
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:47,148
You came all the way from New York
to marry Dan Morgan?

115
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:50,562
There seems to be some mystery, gentlemen.

116
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:53,230
Mr. Morgan wrote me
that if he couldn't meet me...

117
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,766
...somebody'd take me to the Homestead Gully.

118
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:58,370
I'd like to go there if it isn't too far.

119
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:01,135
Does anyone know where it is?

120
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:06,338
You see, miss, Homestead Gully
has been taken off the map.

121
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,874
Would you like a little drink, miss?

122
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:12,140
Could you tell me where
I could find Mr. Morgan?

123
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,280
Well...

124
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,083
Go on, Jed.
You've been doing all the talking.

125
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:20,292
I hate to be the first
to break the news, miss, but...

126
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:25,457
...Mr. Morgan has been
taken off the map likewise.

127
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:32,063
- He's dead?
- He's deader than a doornail.

128
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:35,436
- Shut up, you varmint.
- Here, drink this.

129
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,604
How did it happen?

130
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:45,273
You see, the red come up
13 times straight in a row...

131
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:48,049
...and the gold mine changed hands.

132
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:51,715
After which unfortunate incident,
Mr. Morgan sort of...

133
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:54,759
...had a misunderstanding.

134
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,158
I'm afraid he was a bad loser, miss.

135
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,959
San Francisco is no place for a bad loser...

136
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,626
...especially if you're not so quick
on the draw.

137
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:03,702
Which he wasn't.

138
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:06,033
I never seen a man take so long
to pull a gun.

139
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:09,198
- He got drilled right clean through...
- Shut up or I'II...

140
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:14,338
Then there's nothing, no...

141
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,838
Miss Rutledge.

142
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:43,339
Allow me to offer my heartfelt sympathy.

143
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:46,003
I don't know why I'm crying, Col. Cobb...

144
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,376
...but that's what men expect of women,
isn't it?

145
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,609
- That they should cry?
- You poor child.

146
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:54,948
It seems my first claim
hasn't panned out so well.

147
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:59,916
You don't fool me, my dear.
You're hurt. Can't I be of some assistance?

148
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,886
You don't understand, Col. Cobb.

149
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,565
I never loved Dan Morgan.

150
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:10,168
- But you were going to marry him.
- Yes.

151
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:12,862
He must have meant something to you.

152
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:15,131
He meant a million dollars.

153
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,275
Miss Rutledge, I'm shocked!

154
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:20,808
Why? Because, I'm not pretending
an emotion I don't feel?

155
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:23,780
You poor dear.
Let me take you back to the ship.

156
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,509
No.

157
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,553
I'm not running away.

158
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:37,459
I came here to get something
and I'm going to get it.

159
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:41,058
Yes, but San Francisco
is no place for a woman.

160
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,233
Why not? I'm not afraid.

161
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,198
I like the fog.

162
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:55,139
I like this new world.
I like the noise of something happening.

163
00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:01,010
No, San Francisco is no place
for a bad loser, man or woman.

164
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,753
Dan Morgan was a bad loser.

165
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,926
I'm not. I'm staying.

166
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:14,126
I'm tired of dreaming, Col. Cobb.
I'm staying.

167
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:18,067
I'm staying and holding out
my hands for gold.

168
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,465
Bright yellow gold.

169
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:32,240
Gentlemen, who got Dan Morgan's money?

170
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:36,583
I'd forget about that money if I were you,
'cause you ain't ever going to get it back.

171
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:37,849
Who got the money?

172
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:40,892
It's in the hands of the worst fiend
in San Francisco.

173
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:43,689
- What's his name?
- His name's Louis Chamalis.

174
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:46,356
He owns the biggest gambling parlor
in California.

175
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:49,992
The Bella Donna,
the one we was telling you about.

176
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,861
- Gentlemen, I'm hungry.
- Of course you are.

177
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:55,270
I should like to have supper
at the Bella Donna.

178
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,304
Let's go down there.

179
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:11,846
- The streets ain't paved yet.
- I see.

180
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:14,954
Make way for a lady.

181
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:30,803
That's opium you smell, miss.

182
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:34,078
Opium and Chinamen
sure perfume up the street.

183
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,275
Make way for a lady.

184
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,457
Don't worry, miss, we'll soon be there.

185
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,326
Look out, here come some more Chinamen.

186
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:05,937
He's just having some fun, miss.
He's going to cut off their pigtails.

187
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,240
- Why?
- If you cut off a Chinaman's pigtail...

188
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,338
...he can't go to Heaven in their religion.

189
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:14,886
- That's the reason they're carrying on so.
- It's outrageous, gentlemen.

190
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:17,912
Surely you would not allow persecution
of this sort...

191
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,957
...to raise its ugly head in this new land.

192
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,083
Look out there, partner.

193
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,684
The Chinese are the oldest civilization
in the world.

194
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:28,096
We must not be intolerant.
We must respect their beliefs.

195
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,665
We must...

196
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:34,367
We must get me out of here!

197
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,341
Couple more minutes and he'd been in China.

198
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,208
Lucky you wasn't on Sacramento Ave.

199
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:46,648
They lost a burro there last week
and ain't found hair of him yet!

200
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:49,346
- Shall we go on to the Bella Donna?
- Yes!

201
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:52,219
I hope this doesn't give you
a wrong impression of our city.

202
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,690
Rome wasn't built in a day, gentlemen.

203
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:58,661
The paths of empire have always started
in the mud and ended in glory.

204
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:01,460
I shall make that the subject
of my first editorial.

205
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:06,053
A white woman.

206
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,444
I've got one of the biggest mines
out here, miss.

207
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:26,985
- I'd be mighty honored if...
- I gotta bigger mine than his, miss.

208
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,111
I was thinkin'
if you might consider marriage.

209
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:30,984
I'd like to meet the little lady, too!

210
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,253
- This is Jack Holt.
- Speakin' about marriage, miss...

211
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,124
We sure hope you're going
to like it out here.

212
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:41,226
I'm mighty serious about that marriage,
indeed I am.

213
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:52,406
- Get back to work.
- Sure.

214
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:58,143
We're taking out more than 100 ounces
of gold and that's more than...

215
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,747
Ain't somebody going to introduce me?

216
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,785
My name is Louis Chamalis.

217
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:12,860
I'm very glad to know you, sir.

218
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,264
Thank you.

219
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:20,999
I'd like that seat.

220
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:35,984
Well, miss...

221
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:39,552
...how do you like San Francisco?

222
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,617
I think I'm going to like it very much.

223
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:46,525
That's fine. I own it.

224
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:53,169
What's your pleasure, gentlemen?
This is on the house.

225
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:54,899
I drink nothin' but rye.

226
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,908
Knuckles, bring some wine.

227
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,239
I hear...

228
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,849
...you come out here to marry Dan Morgan.

229
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,043
Yes.

230
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:09,950
There's no accountin' for taste.

231
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:13,818
You'd have been throwing yourself
away on him.

232
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:19,253
You'd have been throwing yourself away.

233
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:22,129
You ain't told me your name yet.

234
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,469
My name is Mary Rutledge.

235
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,230
Nice name.

236
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,597
I am Col. Marcus Aurelius Cobb, sir.

237
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:31,440
I'm glad to know you.

238
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:35,008
- Miss Rutledge is not staying here, sir.
- Is that true?

239
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:39,781
- Depends on how much I like your town.
- Miss Rutledge, I beg you to reconsider.

240
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:43,218
Good night, Mr. Cobb.
Hope we'll see you around here often.

241
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:47,120
Good night, Col. Cobb and thank you.

242
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,059
Ready?

243
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,657
Happy New Year!

244
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:37,432
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

245
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:57,360
- I didn't hear you knock, sir.
- I guess that's because I didn't knock.

246
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,488
How do you feel?

247
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,266
I feel like New Year's morning, Mr. Chamalis.

248
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,269
I kinda thought you might,
so I brought you something.

249
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,635
Go on, take it.
We call this a prairie oyster.

250
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,230
It'll make you feel better.

251
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:11,400
Thank you.

252
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:18,815
Have you made up your mind
about what I told you last night?

253
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,949
Let me see. It was something about...

254
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:23,651
...marriage, wasn't it?

255
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:25,989
No, that wasn't me.

256
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,617
Have you something better to offer?

257
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:33,157
Let's you and me understand each other.

258
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,829
You ain't stayin' in San Francisco
to go into society, are you?

259
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:40,037
You're staying here for gold.

260
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:43,569
And you didn't bring a pick
and shovel with you, either.

261
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,666
You seem to have everything all figured out.

262
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:48,871
You're quite right. I'm staying for gold.

263
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:52,445
Then, you'll be glad to hear
that you've found it.

264
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:56,654
- I take it that you're a journey's end.
- Yeah.

265
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,958
That's me. Say, now look here.

266
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,958
You had a lot of the boys last night laying
bags of gold at them little feet of yours.

267
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:08,155
Them bags of gold is mine.

268
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:11,163
Only I don't have to dig
and sweat to get them.

269
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,204
I see. They shovel it out of the ground...

270
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:16,502
...and they hand it to you across the table
with the wheel on it.

271
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,406
You're high-falutin',
but you're smart, ain't you?

272
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,172
Yes, I'm smart.

273
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,548
You got a pretty way of holdin' your head.

274
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:27,351
What's your proposition, Mr. Chamalis?

275
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,716
All right. You work at the table, see?

276
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:33,423
You're worth a lot to me as an attraction.

277
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:36,983
They'll come swarming in here
like flies around a pot of honey.

278
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:41,531
How would you like to get part of
all the gold that's dug up around here?

279
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,066
Suppose I lose?

280
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:46,797
You lose only when you wanna
and you win when you wanna.

281
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:49,169
That's the kind of a little wheel it is.

282
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:54,868
Is that the wheel Dan Morgan played?

283
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,807
The very same one.

284
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,545
Head feel better?

285
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:02,751
Very much better, thank you.

286
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:04,481
Then it's a bargain?

287
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:05,947
Yes.

288
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,123
Good.

289
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,571
Like a swan, ain't it?

290
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:27,638
That's what you're like.

291
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,110
Soft and slick.

292
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:33,350
A swan.

293
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:40,150
One thing more, Mr. Chamalis.

294
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:43,823
I suggest you get used to knocking on doors.

295
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:47,362
All right, Swan.

296
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,305
San Francisco is getting
to be more like a city.

297
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:32,070
I've been in cities where they chased me
off the streets like a mad dog.

298
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:34,407
Shut up, before I start doing
some more chasing.

299
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:38,108
Looks like they'll have to build
a couple of more stores here pretty soon.

300
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:41,379
- Do you like this, Swan?
- It's very nice, sir.

301
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:43,544
It'd look right pretty on you.

302
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,646
I don't like that.

303
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:49,793
She can be the orneriest critter!

304
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:53,023
Shut up. I like her when she talks like that.

305
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:59,635
If it ain't the Mayor
of this thriving metropolis.

306
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:02,229
- Louis!
- Good morning, Mr. Mayor.

307
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,900
I want you to meet a friend of mine.
Miss Rutledge.

308
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:09,346
I'm sorry, sir, but I'm with my wife.
Come, my dear.

309
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:16,786
Why, the ungrateful coyote.
The two-faced hyena.

310
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:19,618
I made him mayor of this town
and I'll stop him being mayor!

311
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:21,123
- I wouldn't do that.
- Why I...

312
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:23,126
- I wouldn't do that!
- But he insulted me!

313
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:25,696
No, he didn't.
He just insulted me, that's all.

314
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:29,858
- I don't like that either!
- You'll get used to it and so will I.

315
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,902
- Now, then...
- I have one gown...

316
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:34,665
I'll show him and that horse-face
he calls his wife.

317
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:38,334
Buzzard meat. That's what she is. Gimme that.

318
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:40,843
- Which one, sir?
- The one she's got her paws on.

319
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:45,575
- Go on, take it. It's mine. I bought it.
- Sorry, miss, this belongs to Mr. Chamalis.

320
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:49,986
I'm buying that, too. It's mine, put it back.

321
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:51,646
- What?
- You heard what I said.

322
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:53,246
I don't approve of your behavior.

323
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:54,416
- You don't?
- No, sir.

324
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:56,858
It's my behavior,
and it's good enough in this town.

325
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,862
I'll show you some real behavior.

326
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:02,627
I'm buying this and that.
I'm buying all this, understand?

327
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:04,759
It's mine. I don't want anyone touching it.

328
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,269
I'm buying everything.

329
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:08,202
Do you want the fish, too?

330
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:11,139
No. Throw the fish to the Mayor's wife.
She looks hungry.

331
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:19,911
Make your plays, gentlemen.

332
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,324
22, even, black. You lose, sir.

333
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:39,630
I've never seen anything like it.
The black's come up six times in a row.

334
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,535
The red's bound to come up soon.

335
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:45,807
Sawbuck McTavish is me name
and I'm the luckiest man in the world.

336
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:48,436
I'm sure you are, sir.
Make your plays, gentlemen.

337
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:52,039
- Make your play, sir.
- Place them on the red, Sandy.

338
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:55,051
Go slow, Sawbuck.
We worked for that for a whole year.

339
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:58,213
I'm tired of bendin' over,
liftin' gold out of the ground.

340
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:02,123
I wanna pick up off the table,
standing up, let 'er go.

341
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,094
- How much is that?
- Weigh it when the gentleman wins.

342
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:08,654
- How about bettin' just half, Sawbuck?
- The play is made.

343
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,631
- All of it, sir?
- All of it, miss.

344
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:14,501
- You're daft, man.
- Daft, am I? Who found Bonanza Creek?

345
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:17,666
I'm the luckiest man in the world.
I never lose.

346
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,569
11, black.

347
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:30,283
- Sawbuck.
- Pull in your whiskers, Sandy.

348
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:33,289
- I want to talk to you.
- I don't want to hear no scolding.

349
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:37,259
- It isn't that, it's...
- Lost to the prettiest blue eyes I ever seen.

350
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:41,321
- Make your bet, sir, or get out.
- You were nicer to me a little while ago.

351
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,300
You'd better skedaddle,
while you've still got your shirt.

352
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:46,927
Sawbuck McTavish
never skedaddled from a lady yet.

353
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:49,529
Come on, let's go somewhere and celebrate.

354
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,131
You're drunk, sir.

355
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:55,076
I wasn't too drunk for gamblin'
and I'm no too drunk for love.

356
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:02,077
He asked for it, gentlemen.

357
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:04,345
I guess he didn't read the sign.

358
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:09,189
Go on, pick him up and take him out.

359
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:11,223
Go on, take him out.

360
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:20,334
You've no heard the last of this.

361
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:23,434
Make your plays, gentlemen.

362
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:26,572
See what he's up to.

363
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:39,915
Wait a minute, partner, where you going?

364
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:42,083
I saw the way she ran that wheel.

365
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:44,661
- How?
- Crooked!

366
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:47,789
And I'm going to tell the whole town.
I'm gonna tell 'em all.

367
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,821
There's your man, Sheriff.

368
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:14,756
- No Chinamen allowed in here.
- He's with us. Go ahead.

369
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,017
Knuckles, I'm sorry...

370
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:18,561
- What's on your mind?
- Nothing serious, Louis, I...

371
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:23,123
We'll do the talking, Sheriff.
Sandy Ferguson was murdered last night.

372
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:27,469
- Shot in the back.
- You know murder is a pretty big word.

373
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:28,698
Never mind, Joe.

374
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:32,708
All right, he was murdered. What about it?

375
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:35,371
We've sworn out a warrant
for the man that did it.

376
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,108
Before we're through,
he'll tell us who ordered it done.

377
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,683
Got a warrant?

378
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:43,921
- All printed out and everything.
- Serve it, Sheriff.

379
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:48,721
- Simply a matter of routine.
- Come on, serve it and take him along.

380
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:50,761
Not so fast, boys.

381
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:55,698
Where do you think you're taking Knuckles?

382
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,631
He's going to stand trial for murder.

383
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,637
You don't have to take him anywhere for that.

384
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,334
You want a trial?

385
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,907
All right.

386
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:10,839
Judge.

387
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:14,316
What is it? How dare you... My dear Louis.

388
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,081
I'm afraid it's rather late
so I think I'll go home.

389
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:19,588
- You're not going home.
- But I have things to do.

390
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,283
Steady, Judge.

391
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,922
Got a little work for you.

392
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,257
For me?

393
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:28,958
Seems that fellow named Ferguson
has just been killed.

394
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,034
Who?

395
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:31,893
- Ferguson, ain't it?
- Yeah.

396
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:35,029
- What's the matter with him?
- He's just been killed.

397
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,505
Ain't it a shame?

398
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,576
- It's appalling. Who did it?
- He's your man.

399
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:40,234
- Which one?
- Him.

400
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:42,004
Knuckles.

401
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:45,776
We've got a warrant. We're going to
put him in jail until court opens.

402
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:49,513
- Court's open now. Go ahead, Judge.
- But my dear Louis...

403
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:52,954
- This ain't no court, it's a saloon.
- It's whatever he says it is.

404
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:56,254
- But, my dear Louis...
- Go ahead, Judge, the court's open.

405
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:02,296
Hear ye.
This honorable court is now in session.

406
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:07,331
Gentlemen, I must insist upon
absolute silence. Pardon me.

407
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,366
And will you kindly remove your hats.

408
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:15,875
Gentlemen, Knuckles is accused of homicide.

409
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,672
- Who seen him do it?
- That fellow was there!

410
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:21,513
- This is the man.
- Come, gentlemen.

411
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:24,110
You can't expect me
to take the word of a Chinaman.

412
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:28,386
- Did any American witness this homicide?
- There ain't any question who did it, Judge.

413
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,517
Come on, get going.

414
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:32,926
Hold your horses.
This court is not going to be hurried.

415
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:36,398
Will you please stop the music
during the trial?

416
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,991
I can't concentrate.

417
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:40,332
- Give the Judge a drink.
- Thank you.

418
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:42,838
Fred, quiet on that noise.

419
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:44,169
That's better.

420
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:48,234
Mr. Slocum, are you prepared to
swear that these statements are true?

421
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,404
Sure.

422
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,708
You are.

423
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:54,516
Let me put it to you,
that if Knuckles did commit this crime...

424
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:56,712
...that he must have had some reason.

425
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:58,652
Of course he had a reason.

426
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:00,451
- Here you are, Judge.
- Thanks.

427
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:04,026
This man Ferguson passed a remark
about Miss Rutledge.

428
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:05,421
He was vulgar.

429
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,091
What? He insulted a lady?
Gentlemen, do you hear that?

430
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,327
He insulted a lady. A woman.

431
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:13,631
That sensitive vessel,
which from our childhood...

432
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:16,070
- Come on, hurry up.
- Yes. Of course.

433
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:18,608
- Under the evidence...
- Hurry up, Judge.

434
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,577
The case is dismissed. Good day, gentlemen.

435
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,271
Have another drink, Judge.

436
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,905
There's your trial.

437
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:28,981
I hate to see you fellows
make mistakes like this.

438
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,684
Might go bad with you sometime.

439
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,991
We'll be back, Chamalis.

440
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,522
Don't come around here
wasting my time anymore.

441
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,825
Get out of here. Come on, get out.

442
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:44,592
Ah Wing.

443
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:52,100
Knuckles.

444
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:01,952
I'm just going to cut your pigtail off.

445
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:05,222
What are you yelling about,
there's nothing to wash in Heaven.

446
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:08,383
What do you want to go there for? Let him go.

447
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:16,658
I'm afraid, my dear Louis,
I really must be going.

448
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:20,103
And so, I shall bid you good day, sir.

449
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:22,138
- Good day, your Honor.
- Thank you.

450
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,306
All right, Tim.

451
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,311
Easy, Mr. Peebles. Don't strain her, sir.

452
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,454
There she goes.

453
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:41,389
She starts, she moves.

454
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:44,518
She seems to feel the thrill
of life along her keel.

455
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:47,092
All right, that's enough.

456
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:49,832
There she is, Mr. Wigham.

457
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:53,495
The last word in human ingenuity,
the modern printing press.

458
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:56,334
She worked fine. Let's look at her insides.

459
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:59,674
- Welcome. Glad to see you all.
- We want to talk to you.

460
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:01,404
You all know Mr. Joseph Wigham?

461
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:05,910
You're just in time
to help christen our new printing press.

462
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:08,575
The beacon that is to guide
the destiny of our city.

463
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:11,154
Glad to hear you say that,
because we want your help.

464
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:12,882
Gentlemen, I'm at your service.

465
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,458
Go on, tell him, Jed.

466
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,720
We want you to write about Louis Chamalis.

467
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,625
- Criticizin' him.
- For being a murderer.

468
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,357
And running this town like a jungle.

469
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:23,963
We want to know if you have the courage
to print in your newspaper...

470
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:26,059
...exactly what's wrong with San Francisco.

471
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,694
That's right.

472
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:30,273
I've waited a long time for this.

473
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:35,234
She's oiled, inked and we're both ready.

474
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:38,006
<i>The Clarion is at your service
in any cause...</i>

475
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:40,710
...that will make San Francisco
a better city to live in.

476
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:42,781
That's fine, that's great.

477
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:45,981
If you'll just sit down,
I'll listen to your story.

478
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:54,124
All right, shut her off.

479
00:33:55,733 --> 00:34:00,670
<i>The first issue of the Clarion, Mr. Wigham.
Look at that make-up. Look at that type.</i>

480
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:02,103
Looks mighty neat.

481
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:05,369
This is something I've dreamed of.
I'm a new man, Mr. Wigham.

482
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:09,537
Forgiven for my journalistic sins.
Restored to my profession.

483
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:12,381
There is nothing that can touch it.

484
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:15,309
One of you stay here.

485
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,580
What's the meaning of this?

486
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:18,052
- That your newspaper?
- Yes.

487
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:19,487
Lemme see it.

488
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:27,628
You want law and order? I'm the law
around here and I give the orders.

489
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:30,826
Why are you buttin' in for?
Did I ever do you any hurt?

490
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:33,529
This is not a personal matter,
it's much more than that.

491
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:34,627
Listen.

492
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,708
Everybody gets along in this town
who minds his own business.

493
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:41,142
You're trying to spoil San Francisco
by printing this kind of stuff.

494
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,677
- Is that the machine this was printed on?
- Get Mr. Slocum in a hurry.

495
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:46,750
You stay where you are. Knuckles.

496
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:48,318
What are you going to do?

497
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,751
You just watch and you'll see.
Smash that machine.

498
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:51,913
You can't do that.

499
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:54,651
I can't? Smash it till there
ain't a word left on it.

500
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,319
- I won't allow it.
- After you finish, burn the building.

501
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:00,522
- You can't do that!
- This is outrageous! He's an old man.

502
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:04,089
He ain't going to get much older acting the
he way he does. Break it up.

503
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:07,228
You can't do that. You mustn't do that.

504
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:11,975
Wait a minute.

505
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:14,806
Louis.

506
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:20,050
- I don't want you to do this.
- Get out, this is business.

507
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:21,914
Then it's my business, too.

508
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:25,419
- Get out. Let me handle this my own way.
- I don't like your way.

509
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:27,787
I've never said anything
but now I'm saying it.

510
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:30,019
All right, have your say and get out.

511
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:34,120
You've done enough things I haven't liked.
I want him to have his paper.

512
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:36,666
- Now listen, Swan...
- I said let him have his paper.

513
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:38,701
Tell Knuckles to get out.

514
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:48,869
Go on, get out, will you?
You heard what she said, go on, get out.

515
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:57,511
- Do you still want your paper?
- If you destroy my press, you destroy me.

516
00:35:57,622 --> 00:36:00,614
More than that, you destroy
the soul of San Francisco, a city...

517
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:03,125
Cut out the high-soundin' talk
and answer me...

518
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:04,785
- Do you want your paper?
- Yes.

519
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:06,761
Then, run it the way you should run it.

520
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:08,661
- What way is that?
- My way.

521
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:11,633
Next time you do anything,
write anything or think anything...

522
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:14,364
...just ask yourself,
"How would Louis Chamalis like it?"

523
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:15,769
Understand?

524
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:18,675
Is that what makes the writing on the paper?

525
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:20,203
Yes.

526
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:23,105
I don't want anybody readin'
this kind of stuff.

527
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,484
There you are.

528
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:31,113
You still got your little plaything.

529
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:34,247
- Come on, Swan.
- I'll come in a moment.

530
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:53,436
Thank you, Miss Rutledge.

531
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:56,780
I couldn't have stood it if they'd broken it.

532
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:00,981
It isn't much use this way though, is it?

533
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:04,119
A poor shamed thing that mustn't speak.

534
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:06,114
It can speak, Colonel.

535
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:11,361
Let it speak the language of the town.
Lies, hypocrisy, and more lies.

536
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:14,223
The beacon of the new empire.

537
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:18,032
Mr. Chamalis' empire.

538
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:23,905
Is this true about Sandy Ferguson?

539
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:28,445
You should know better than I, Miss Rutledge.

540
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:46,489
Louis, I want to talk to you.
This is true, isn't it?

541
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:48,956
Sure.

542
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:52,467
- Why did you kill Sandy Ferguson?
- For business reasons.

543
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:56,404
Our bargains included lots of things.
But this wasn't one of them.

544
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:57,565
I don't like it.

545
00:37:57,675 --> 00:38:01,577
Listen, Swan, I'm running this town
and there's only one way to run it.

546
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:03,109
My way.

547
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:05,042
I'm beginning to learn that...

548
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,341
...and it isn't a pleasant lesson.

549
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:11,686
Come on, Swan, have a drink.

550
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,256
I'm one up on you.

551
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,957
You haven't thanked me yet
for lettin' the Colonel have his paper.

552
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:20,528
Thank you.
You seemed almost human for a moment.

553
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:23,594
How about you being human for a change?

554
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:26,162
I'd like another drink, please.

555
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:29,370
Why don't you ever kiss me
of your own accord?

556
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,571
Why don't you ever put your arms
around me and kiss me?

557
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:34,338
Wait till I have my drink.

558
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:38,814
I don't want that kind of love.

559
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:44,419
I'm sick of you talking to me like that.

560
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:47,514
I'm sick of you looking at me
like I was a snake in a gold skin.

561
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:48,717
Stop it, you're drunk.

562
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,316
I told you I'd wait, didn't I?

563
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:53,659
I've waited long enough.
You're going to love me or you're through!

564
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:55,789
You're going to say you love me and mean it.

565
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,232
I don't want any woman
looking at me like you do.

566
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,964
You're going to say you love me or get out.

567
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:03,330
I heard you. Don't keep repeating it.

568
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:05,739
- Is that all you got to say?
- Just that I'm going.

569
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:08,038
You're going, are you? Where?

570
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:11,171
There isn't a man who would
speak to you if you went out of here.

571
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:12,977
Because they know I'll kill 'em.

572
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:15,109
I'll kill the first man you talk to.

573
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:20,851
What do you want me to do, lie?
Lie and pretend I have a heart?

574
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:24,416
Do you think I'm still Mary Rutledge,
that I'm still a white woman?

575
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:25,688
Shut up.

576
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:29,254
Look at me, Louis.
Look in my eyes. What do you see?

577
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:33,392
It isn't pretty, is it?
I'm just what you see there.

578
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:37,399
Take what you can get, Louis,
and let it go at that.

579
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:40,101
Let's enjoy our mud puddle.

580
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,053
- Where are you going?
- I'm going riding.

581
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:00,562
I want the wind and the air on me.

582
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:04,226
- Yes, but it's going to rain.
- I like the rain, too.

583
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:06,996
Swan.

584
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,932
I want to talk to you about last night.

585
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:16,342
Forget it, Louis. I'm trying to.
I'll be back in time to run the table.

586
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:54,074
I'm sorry to break in on you like this,
mister, but...

587
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,386
...it's getting pretty wet out there.

588
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,987
What's the matter?

589
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:07,058
I can't get over it.

590
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:10,194
- Over what?
- How beautiful a woman is.

591
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:12,335
I'd almost forgotten, so help me.

592
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:18,064
Did you ever read about Balboa when he
first caught sight of the Pacific Ocean?

593
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:22,078
- What are you talking about?
- He fainted with pure joy.

594
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:25,004
You're the most peculiar desert rat
I've seen yet.

595
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:28,676
Would you mind very much if I
looked at you, if I promise not to faint?

596
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,677
You're pretty wet, ma'am.

597
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:34,986
Don't you think you ought to hang those
clothes of yours in front of the fire to dry?

598
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:36,820
Well...

599
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,891
I'm afraid there's only this one room, but...

600
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:44,328
I'll either have to go outside or I could use
my willpower and turn my back.

601
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,729
- Turn around, mister.
- Yes, ma'am.

602
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:53,106
I apologize for this place.
I found it myself a few minutes ago.

603
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:57,079
That's how I happened to join the gold rush.

604
00:41:57,181 --> 00:42:00,776
It was a case of going to work for my
father or finding the Golden Fleece.

605
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:02,919
I'm afraid I'm gabbin' my head off, but...

606
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:07,047
...I haven't talked to anybody for two years,
except my two burros.

607
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:09,148
I reckon you met them outside.

608
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,494
What did you talk to them about?

609
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:14,195
About cakes of soap.
Whether I'd shave or not.

610
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:17,529
Lamb kidneys in wine sauce
for breakfast we used to have at home.

611
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:21,035
- You're from New York, aren't you?
- 14 Gramercy Park.

612
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:24,767
Gramercy Park!
I used to play there when I was a little girl.

613
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,503
You weren't that little brat
with the Shetland pony?

614
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:31,407
No, I don't think you know me.

615
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:35,080
I was raised under a bell jar
with forget-me-nots in my hair.

616
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,585
Clothes dry yet?

617
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:39,049
I'll see.

618
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:43,488
Yes. I guess they're about cooked now, ma'am.

619
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,162
I'm afraid I'll have to use
my willpower again.

620
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,877
Pardon my curiosity, ma'am, but...

621
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:05,176
...I'm amazed to find anyone like you
blooming away in this arid land of gold.

622
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:07,273
You live in San Francisco?

623
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:12,011
No, I'm just visiting here.

624
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:13,248
Alone?

625
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,419
No. My family is with me, naturally.

626
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:18,128
Prospecting?

627
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:22,931
No, we're just visiting someone
who owns a ranch.

628
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:25,799
You can turn around now.

629
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:30,572
Would you mind my asking you
who you are, ma'am?

630
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:32,471
My name is Mary Rutledge.

631
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:36,379
Pleased to meet you, Miss Rutledge.
My name's James Carmichael.

632
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:39,482
I've never seen you before, have I?

633
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:41,544
In San Francisco?

634
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:45,554
No, I've never been there, only to get off
the boat and now to get on it again.

635
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:48,252
- You're leaving the West?
- Yes.

636
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:50,452
Shipping out like Sindbad with his loot.

637
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:52,760
Here it is.

638
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:55,761
I've been poking around
for this stuff for about two years.

639
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:58,892
I keep expecting it to vanish
like the figments of a dream.

640
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:02,798
It's safe now, that is, if I can get by
the harpies at San Francisco.

641
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:06,536
- The harpies?
- Yes, ma'am.

642
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,135
Although some people call them
by other names.

643
00:44:12,082 --> 00:44:14,744
- Can I help you button that?
- Thank you.

644
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:17,316
Remember how Ulysses
had to stuff cotton in his ears...

645
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:19,548
...to keep from hearing
the song of the Siren?

646
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,125
They're going to have
to sing awfully loud for me.

647
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:23,850
What does a harpy look like?

648
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:27,897
They've got snakes in their hair and
cats' eyes and no hearts at all.

649
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,625
You can always tell them easy.

650
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:33,967
This is more fun than digging gold.

651
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:37,905
If you weren't a lady from Gramercy Park
and I weren't a poetical half-wit...

652
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:41,967
...full of the most idiotic respect
for beauty and grace and gentility, I'd...

653
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:46,375
- You'd what, Mr. Carmichael?
- I'd act a lot different than I'd been acting.

654
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,007
You've been very charming.

655
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:50,177
That's the trouble with being
a poet at heart.

656
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:52,687
You always have to be charming
at the wrong time.

657
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,556
You don't mind this loose talk I hope, ma'am?

658
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:57,953
There.

659
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:01,227
I guess you're buttoned now and forever.

660
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:03,262
It seems to have stopped raining.

661
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,362
I think we'd better go.

662
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:09,762
I had an idea we were never
going to leave here, but...

663
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:12,432
...I guess that's impractical.

664
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:14,168
I'm afraid it is.

665
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:18,846
How am I going to write to you
if I don't know where you live?

666
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:22,350
I write awfully well, something like
Shelley when I'm in the mood.

667
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:26,549
- I'll read you something he wrote.
- You haven't time, Mr. Carmichael.

668
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:30,320
This is my road, and that's yours,
to the boat...

669
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:32,622
...and the lamb chops in wine sauce.

670
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,425
Lamb kidneys, ma'am.

671
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,363
Only they don't seem so important now.

672
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:41,766
- Can't I see you home?
- You'll miss the boat.

673
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:44,232
Aren't I ever going to see you again?

674
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:46,502
I'd like to remember it just like this.

675
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,475
The rain, the fog...

676
00:45:49,113 --> 00:45:51,946
...and a poet from Gramercy Park
with his bags of gold.

677
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:53,607
Let's leave it that way.

678
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:56,352
It's awfully hard to live poetry.

679
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:58,921
Goodbye, Mr. Carmichael.

680
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:03,660
Will you take this as a present, then,
and read it yourself?

681
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,285
And pretend I wrote it?

682
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:06,692
Thank you.

683
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,831
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

684
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:14,831
Hey!

685
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,834
You don't want a couple of jackasses
to remember me by?

686
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:21,672
No, thank you. Goodbye.

687
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:28,084
Kind of foggy, ain't it, Josephine?

688
00:46:28,752 --> 00:46:30,947
Maybe that old boat won't sail after all.

689
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:40,188
Where have you been?
I've been worried about you.

690
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:43,789
I've been riding, Louis, in Gramercy Park.

691
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:47,767
What are you talking about?
There ain't no Gramercy Park around here.

692
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:49,730
I guess you're right.

693
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:53,503
Is something the matter? Did anything happen?

694
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:55,370
A lot happened.

695
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,845
- What?
- I got caught in the rain.

696
00:46:58,115 --> 00:47:02,415
Got soaked.
Rode back a thousand miles and here I am.

697
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:05,111
That's all that matters, isn't it?

698
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:08,515
That's all that matters.

699
00:47:09,193 --> 00:47:11,218
I guess I'd better change my things.

700
00:47:34,218 --> 00:47:36,118
I beg your pardon, gentlemen.

701
00:47:36,753 --> 00:47:38,243
Is this the way to the boat?

702
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:40,050
- Passenger?
- Yes.

703
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:42,482
There's no use
your going aboard tonight, sir.

704
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:46,154
That is, unless you want to.
We ain't sailin' till this fog lifts.

705
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:48,788
- How soon do you expect that?
- A day or two.

706
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:50,799
I'll be seein' you on deck, sir.

707
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,232
- That's mighty discouragin', stranger.
- Yes, it is.

708
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:01,504
- You hit it rich and homeward bound?
- Yes.

709
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:04,136
You don't figure on standin' here
until the fog lifts?

710
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:05,647
I don't know.

711
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:09,378
Reason tells that's the smartest
thing to do. To stand right here.

712
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,416
But I've been too reasonable all day.

713
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:15,456
Something I left up in the air
that I'd like to attend to.

714
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:19,219
- How about a nice home-cooked meal first?
- Lead on, sir.

715
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:23,188
Lucky you met up with me, I can
protect you from the perils of the city.

716
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,324
Yes.

717
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:27,998
Yes siree. They had me hemmed in,
so I pulled my gun...

718
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:30,096
...and I clipped one down there
and one man...

719
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:34,200
- Take it easy, you might hurt somebody.
- Don't be afraid, son, it ain't loaded.

720
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:35,278
It's not loaded?

721
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:37,847
No, I don't depend on firearms
for protection...

722
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:40,075
...it's my muscles that scares them away.

723
00:48:40,183 --> 00:48:42,743
If you were to know things
I've done with my bare...

724
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:45,686
Here's a nice homey place for a stranger,
the Bella Donna.

725
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:47,654
Yes. I've heard of it.

726
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:51,784
Maybe you'd like me to help you carry
that gold. You're apt to strain yourself.

727
00:48:51,895 --> 00:48:53,795
No. Thanks just the same.

728
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:57,663
It's a shame not to take advantage of
my strength, but have it your own way.

729
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,565
Some folks are suspicious for no reason.

730
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:02,662
I never saw more grand larceny
behind one pair of whiskers.

731
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,707
- You ain't foolin', son?
- No.

732
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:10,238
You know most folks
don't seem to realize how bad I am.

733
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:15,847
Let's sit here and I'll fetch a garsin.

734
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:16,942
What's a garsin?

735
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:19,545
That's what we call waiters in San Francisco.

736
00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:22,489
"Garsin".
That's a kind of stylish nickname.

737
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:23,957
Garsin, come.

738
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:26,393
Quit yer hollerin'. What do you want?

739
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:28,964
Don't get fresh with me.
I'll shove you off the earth.

740
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:30,499
Start shovin'.

741
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:32,565
He's always foolin'.

742
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:35,137
Give us a minute
and get us a couple more drinks.

743
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:37,297
You'd better make it a bottle,
tootie-sweetie.

744
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:40,405
That's French. Let's wet the whistle.

745
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,275
I think I'll have...

746
00:49:50,754 --> 00:49:53,222
Makes me look a little more ferocious.

747
00:50:04,434 --> 00:50:07,631
If you can't make out what that says,
Number 3 is the best meal.

748
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:10,502
- What's she doing here?
- Who?

749
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:14,973
Her? Told you this was a nice homey
place. That's the lady known as Swan.

750
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:16,645
- Swan?
- Yep.

751
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:18,078
How long has she been here?

752
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,945
<i>Brought her in myself,
right off the Flyin' Cloud.</i>

753
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:22,676
Here's your bottle.

754
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,678
- She come alone?
- Yeah.

755
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:28,246
But Mr. Chamalis wanted her services
exclusive for the Bella Donna.

756
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:32,090
- Did she ever live on a ranch?
- Her? A ranch?

757
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:36,961
- The joke's on me.
- If you're lookin' for fun, there it is.

758
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:40,230
Win or lose, it's a pleasure
just to stand beside her at the table.

759
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:45,401
Can you see from here
whether she has snakes in her hair?

760
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:47,773
Son, go easy on that liquor.

761
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:59,387
Brought you another admirer, Swan.
All quiverin' to try his luck agin' ya.

762
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:07,189
10, black, even.

763
00:51:08,331 --> 00:51:09,923
Old man, advise me.

764
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:12,997
Are those snakes in her hair
or forget-me-nots?

765
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:15,799
It's all right.
He's a little young and been drinkin'.

766
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:21,735
No, they're not snakes. They're diamonds.
She's got lovely cats' eyes.

767
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:25,643
What's the delay, Swan. Come on, spin her.

768
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,115
Make your plays, gentlemen.

769
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:33,781
Quiet. I want to hear the song of the Siren.

770
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:37,849
- That ain't no way to talk to a lady.
- I most humbly apologize.

771
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:42,994
I forgot she was raised under a bell jar
with a sprig of forget-me-nots in her hair.

772
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:47,395
21, red. Waiter.

773
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:54,008
I'll take that.

774
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:57,877
Let's drink together, ma'am.
To me, James Carmichael.

775
00:51:59,182 --> 00:52:02,982
The dumbest jackass that ever came
hee-hawing into San Francisco.

776
00:52:04,387 --> 00:52:07,379
- Put your money up or get out.
- Come on, put up your money.

777
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:09,391
Come on, spin that wheel. Let's get going.

778
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:12,155
All right, here goes.

779
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:19,601
- Gramercy Park versus the hallucination.
- You'd better get it weighed first, son.

780
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:22,634
We'll weigh it for the gentleman
when he wins.

781
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:26,773
On the black, the color of women's hearts.

782
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:28,811
Easy. You ain't gonna get no place
with them sentiments.

783
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:33,008
- A little less fancy talk, stranger.
- Sorry to give offense.

784
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:38,079
7 and red.

785
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:39,952
You lose this one time, son.

786
00:52:40,056 --> 00:52:44,186
If at first you don't succeed, try again.
That's my motto since a child.

787
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:45,989
- Is that it?
- Yes, sir.

788
00:52:46,763 --> 00:52:47,991
Knuckles.

789
00:52:50,033 --> 00:52:51,557
Give him this.

790
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,703
Here you are, stranger. On the house.

791
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:02,643
Thank you. Hospitable of you.

792
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:04,737
Make your bets, gentlemen.

793
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,407
Had enough, you?

794
00:53:08,652 --> 00:53:10,620
Not so fast there.

795
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:21,694
- You ain't bettin' it all at once, are you?
- On the black.

796
00:53:34,477 --> 00:53:38,538
- Does it all go?
- Go on, roll your hoop.

797
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:45,218
Round and round the old willow tree.

798
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:48,516
Come on, old man of the sea.
Drink to the little ball.

799
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:58,067
27. And it's red.

800
00:54:01,605 --> 00:54:05,234
- Who won?
- The red. Yes, sir, the red come up again.

801
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,574
Not my color.

802
00:54:07,677 --> 00:54:12,512
You lost! Just like I did!
You lost like Sawbuck McTavish.

803
00:54:12,816 --> 00:54:16,183
Cover up your back
or they'll shoot you like they did Sandy.

804
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:18,015
- Get out!
- I seen it.

805
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:25,251
To Madam Swan and to Galahad.

806
00:54:25,362 --> 00:54:28,525
The pure in heart
and the expert dress cottoner.

807
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:36,828
One day, the black will win
and the harpies will weep.

808
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,500
Don't get excited, stranger.

809
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:46,513
Go on, take him out.

810
00:54:58,695 --> 00:55:00,663
Make your plays, gentlemen.

811
00:55:20,183 --> 00:55:22,208
Hey, Swan, open the door.

812
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,788
Please, go away, Louis.

813
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,753
Come on, open the door.
I've got something for you.

814
00:55:28,858 --> 00:55:30,553
Part of the money you won tonight.

815
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:34,392
I don't want it. Keep it.

816
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:37,162
What you acting so hot for?

817
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:40,102
I don't know.

818
00:55:41,971 --> 00:55:44,337
Just go away and leave me alone.

819
00:55:49,913 --> 00:55:53,872
Women are like frogs. You can never tell
which way they're gonna jump.

820
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:16,369
The old man of the sea.

821
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:18,240
How are you?

822
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:22,368
Son, still feel a little depressed
over your bad luck last night.

823
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:30,679
- Yes, I remember.
- I never seen the like before.

824
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:33,688
Don't let it dampen
that fine western spirit of yours.

825
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:35,953
I still have two burros left.

826
00:56:36,426 --> 00:56:38,860
That's right, ya did.
But you ain't got 'em now.

827
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,560
They run away.

828
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:44,396
A very interesting city.

829
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,865
Surprised I have my boots.

830
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:49,403
- Any complaints?
- No.

831
00:56:49,773 --> 00:56:51,104
No complaints.

832
00:56:51,207 --> 00:56:53,675
Wisdom was never bought at so cheap a price.

833
00:56:55,812 --> 00:56:59,179
You still feel pretty bad, son?
Maybe it's somethin' you ate.

834
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:03,619
Gall and wormwood sit hard
on the delicate stomach.

835
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:10,248
Gentlemen, I don't want to depress you
with my problems...

836
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:14,421
...but is there a way for the shorn lamb to
earn enough money for his passage home?

837
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:17,500
A shorn lamb
of infinite accomplishments and...

838
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:20,495
...a great mass of personal charm.

839
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:22,997
I like the way he talks.

840
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,498
I don't.

841
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,336
Nobody's askin' you.

842
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:29,370
I like a windbag like that around.

843
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:32,877
- Go on, get him something to do.
- If you say so.

844
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:37,551
Get busy on those.

845
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:45,821
You mean these interesting vessels?

846
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:49,556
We call 'em spittoons and we like 'em shiny.

847
00:57:50,066 --> 00:57:54,935
With all deference to my benefactor,
I think I'll call them cuspidors.

848
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:14,848
- How do you feel, son?
- Like a useful member of society at last.

849
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:15,925
That's fine.

850
00:58:16,025 --> 00:58:20,394
- You ever wait on table?
- No. I'm sure I have a talent for it.

851
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,089
You can begin now.

852
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:24,723
It ain't hard to be a garsin.

853
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:27,564
Just stick up for your rights
when they get fresh with you.

854
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:31,436
And always take a bottle in your right hand
and when they're comin' to...

855
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:38,771
I may spoil her appetite.

856
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:50,482
Good morning.
Would you like to see the menu, ma'am?

857
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:53,084
- What are you doing here?
- I'm waiting for your order.

858
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,561
I don't want you around here.

859
00:58:54,664 --> 00:58:58,657
I don't blame you after last night.
I'm very glad of this chance to apologize.

860
00:58:58,768 --> 00:59:01,293
I don't like sarcasm
so early in the day from waiters.

861
00:59:01,404 --> 00:59:03,668
There's no sarcasm intended, ma'am.

862
00:59:03,773 --> 00:59:06,037
You hate me, why hide it behind silly words?

863
00:59:06,142 --> 00:59:11,079
That's not an accurate account of my feelings.
The worst I feel is kind of philosophical.

864
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:15,006
What are you standing there for?
I told you I don't want you around here.

865
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:19,578
If you don't mind, I'd like to work here until
I get money to go back to New York.

866
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:22,783
You could steer clear
of the harpies next time.

867
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:26,289
What would you have for breakfast?
Would you like to see the menu?

868
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:29,590
I'll give you your fare back
to Gramercy Park, Mr. Carmichael.

869
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:33,533
I'm sorry, but I have some notion
on the subject of handouts.

870
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:38,029
- I'm not good enough to give you money.
- I'm not bad enough to take it, ma'am.

871
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:41,975
If you don't hate me, I hate you.
With all of your talk about being a poet...

872
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:45,104
...you're small, mean, righteous,
and no different from the rest.

873
00:59:45,214 --> 00:59:49,708
- Would you like to see the menu, ma'am?
- Bring me some toast, coffee and jam.

874
00:59:49,852 --> 00:59:51,149
And yes...

875
00:59:51,454 --> 00:59:53,820
...some lamb kidneys in wine sauce.

876
00:59:54,557 --> 00:59:55,956
Yes, ma'am.

877
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:06,294
I just met a fellow
who told me something very interesting.

878
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:11,704
I told you what was going to happen to
you if I ever caught you lyin'!

879
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:14,175
I caught you.

880
01:00:15,211 --> 01:00:17,645
What a pleasant way to begin
a conversation, Louis.

881
01:00:17,747 --> 01:00:19,408
And before breakfast, too.

882
01:00:19,882 --> 01:00:22,749
- You wasn't alone in the rain.
- You mean yesterday.

883
01:00:22,852 --> 01:00:26,253
You know what I mean. Yeah, yesterday.

884
01:00:27,156 --> 01:00:28,418
You was seen.

885
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:32,061
Come out with it. Don't sit there
like a dog barking at a cat in a tree.

886
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:33,128
I was seen doing what?

887
01:00:33,229 --> 01:00:34,457
- Who was he?
- Who was who?

888
01:00:34,564 --> 01:00:36,623
Who was the man you were with yesterday?

889
01:00:36,733 --> 01:00:37,791
You're hurting my arm.

890
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:40,061
I'll hurt worse than that
if you don't tell me.

891
01:00:40,169 --> 01:00:42,660
You were seen with him by the water,
talking to him.

892
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:44,399
- Who was he?
- I told you...

893
01:00:44,507 --> 01:00:46,065
I beg your pardon, ma'am.

894
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:49,508
There are no lamb kidneys.
Would you like the wine sauce by itself?

895
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:53,378
We're talkin', can't you see?
Go on, get out of here.

896
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:55,742
Sure.

897
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:00,152
Who was he?

898
01:01:00,456 --> 01:01:03,516
Louis, I told you I got lost
in the fog and I...

899
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:06,686
I stopped somebody to ask the way
and he told me.

900
01:01:06,796 --> 01:01:10,994
- That isn't a hanging offense, is it?
- I'll find out if you're lying.

901
01:01:13,136 --> 01:01:14,535
Waiter.

902
01:01:15,104 --> 01:01:18,835
Bring me a steak and a piece of pie.

903
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:33,049
Did you hear about
the Chinaman being killed last night?

904
01:01:33,156 --> 01:01:34,180
Yes.

905
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:37,951
I was wondering, Colonel, if I couldn't...

906
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:41,326
...weave it into this piece
about the climate.

907
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:43,524
Sayin' how sorry we was that the Chinaman...

908
01:01:43,633 --> 01:01:47,467
...was goin' to miss the salubrious spell of
weather we're expectin' next week.

909
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:51,302
All topics sound hollow
and commonplace compared to...

910
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:53,967
...the glorious climate of California,
Mr. Wigham.

911
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,278
Mr. McTavish was in again.

912
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:58,704
What did he want?

913
01:01:58,815 --> 01:02:01,909
He had an item about the
roulette wheel at the Bella Donna.

914
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:04,578
He says it's crooked,
that they stole a small fortune...

915
01:02:04,687 --> 01:02:06,882
...from a young fellow
playing there last night.

916
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:09,856
It's quite an interesting item, Colonel.

917
01:02:10,359 --> 01:02:15,262
Avoid all mundane matters,
and we shall flourish like a green bay tree.

918
01:02:19,368 --> 01:02:20,960
The beacon of the press.

919
01:02:23,172 --> 01:02:26,835
In the hell to which all journalists must
descend when they die...

920
01:02:26,943 --> 01:02:30,743
...we shall sit at red-hot desks
with quills of fire in our hand...

921
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:35,341
...and spend eternity writing about
the salubrious weather of that region.

922
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:40,486
Let us serve our apprenticeship here
thoroughly and intelligently.

923
01:02:42,692 --> 01:02:45,627
How do you spell "aurora borealis?"

924
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:50,896
Call it Mr. Chamalis' rosy-fingered dawn.

925
01:03:08,317 --> 01:03:09,477
What's that?

926
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:13,612
You've got eyes, go on and read it.
It's news, that's what it is.

927
01:03:13,723 --> 01:03:16,556
News you wouldn't print
in that yellow-dog paper of yours.

928
01:03:16,659 --> 01:03:19,127
You'd better not put that up.
There'll be trouble.

929
01:03:19,228 --> 01:03:20,252
There will that...

930
01:03:20,363 --> 01:03:24,766
I strongly advise against it, sir.
Mr. McTavish, take that down.

931
01:03:24,867 --> 01:03:26,164
You had...

932
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:29,872
I warned you.

933
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:33,373
Go on back inside
and write a story about the climate.

934
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:36,308
Stop where you are, sir!

935
01:03:36,746 --> 01:03:40,580
<i>This is the first honest news the Clarion
ever had and it's going to stay there!</i>

936
01:03:40,683 --> 01:03:43,208
Stop or I'll shoot!

937
01:03:57,733 --> 01:03:59,064
Mr. Wigham.

938
01:04:02,205 --> 01:04:06,005
Colonel, are you hurt bad?
Get a doctor quick.

939
01:04:06,108 --> 01:04:08,008
Land a hand here, someone.

940
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:12,307
- Mr. Wigham.
- Yes?

941
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:17,115
<i>I want you to change
the policy of the Clarion.</i>

942
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,989
I want you to write a story...

943
01:04:22,124 --> 01:04:25,719
...I should have written myself long ago.

944
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:31,862
I want you to tell
the people of San Francisco...

945
01:04:32,468 --> 01:04:36,234
...that no city can exist
without law and order.

946
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:38,364
Don't try to talk, Colonel.

947
01:04:42,678 --> 01:04:45,613
Write a story about that flag.

948
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:49,113
Write that wherever it flies...

949
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:52,481
...it brings a promise of life...

950
01:04:53,155 --> 01:04:56,420
...liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

951
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:02,858
There are some people in this town
who don't seem to know that.

952
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:06,293
<i>Let the Clarion tell them.</i>

953
01:05:08,971 --> 01:05:11,337
- Print the news.
- I will, Colonel.

954
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,101
We'll carry on.

955
01:05:16,779 --> 01:05:18,406
Law and order.

956
01:05:19,482 --> 01:05:20,710
Print it.

957
01:05:38,401 --> 01:05:41,928
You've got a job. We're here to help you.

958
01:05:51,013 --> 01:05:52,844
Two of you, come with me.

959
01:05:54,216 --> 01:05:56,684
I don't need anybody to go with me.

960
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:07,696
Here you are, gents.
At last we've got a paper in this town.

961
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:11,824
<i>All about law and order.
Here you are. The Clarion.</i>

962
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:13,090
Take one.

963
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:16,495
The voice of San Francisco.
No charge, brother.

964
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:20,369
- All about law and order.
- What you think! Law and order.

965
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:24,845
She's come to San Francisco.
Buy the paper, she's free.

966
01:06:25,247 --> 01:06:27,647
Law and order in San Francisco.

967
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:30,217
That's a new one on you, brother.

968
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:34,187
Law and order in San Francisco.
Law and order has come to stay.

969
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:37,123
Law and order is here to stay.

970
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,697
"Law and order".

971
01:06:45,101 --> 01:06:48,559
- I'll give then some law and order.
- Lot of 'em running around down there.

972
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:52,607
Selling those things all over the streets.
And they've got guns to back 'em up.

973
01:06:53,642 --> 01:06:55,507
I got guns, too.

974
01:06:55,611 --> 01:06:59,570
The first thing is to bust the machine
that printed this, like I should have done.

975
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:01,980
Go to the paper
and take some of the boys with you.

976
01:07:02,084 --> 01:07:03,779
I won't need anybody.

977
01:07:05,588 --> 01:07:07,249
So you killed Col. Cobb.

978
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:10,889
You must be crazy. You think you can
go on killing and destroying...

979
01:07:10,993 --> 01:07:12,255
No. Never mind about that.

980
01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:17,530
I found this under your pillow.
Who gave it to you?

981
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:22,293
It's about love. Poems. Who gave it to you?

982
01:07:25,641 --> 01:07:27,734
Do you want me to take
the little wheel tonight?

983
01:07:27,843 --> 01:07:30,334
I'll find out who he is,
but I'm giving you a chance.

984
01:07:30,446 --> 01:07:32,141
- Tell me.
- There's nothing to tell.

985
01:07:32,248 --> 01:07:34,842
Some rat with a book of poems.
That's what you went for.

986
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:36,212
That's what made you push me away?

987
01:07:36,308 --> 01:07:37,310
- Who is he?
- Stop it!

988
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:39,251
I bet he held you and made you happy.

989
01:07:39,355 --> 01:07:41,755
You stupid fool.
Nobody's touched me and nobody will.

990
01:07:41,857 --> 01:07:44,621
- You and nobody else. Understand?
- He kissed you, didn't he?

991
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:48,128
You kissed him like you never done to me.
Throwin' yourself on some rat.

992
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:52,064
I wish I had. I wish I could tell you
something to make you howl and shoot!

993
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:57,096
I'll do the shooting.

994
01:07:57,873 --> 01:08:00,205
But somebody else is going to do the howling.

995
01:08:02,778 --> 01:08:03,870
Here he comes.

996
01:08:03,979 --> 01:08:05,571
Anybody with him?

997
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,853
Keep on walking, Mr. Jacoby.

998
01:08:20,229 --> 01:08:22,322
- Which way?
- We'll steer you.

999
01:08:22,565 --> 01:08:24,123
Turn right here.

1000
01:08:33,008 --> 01:08:35,169
You call this a fair fight?

1001
01:08:37,012 --> 01:08:39,310
You're not in a fight, Mr. Jacoby.

1002
01:08:40,683 --> 01:08:42,708
You're on trial, Knuckles.

1003
01:08:44,086 --> 01:08:46,384
- For what?
- Murder.

1004
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:50,290
Where's the trial going to be?

1005
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:53,091
The trial is going on now, sir.

1006
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:01,533
Can I get word to Chamalis
to get me a lawyer?

1007
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:03,535
I'm representing you, sir.

1008
01:09:04,373 --> 01:09:07,570
- With a gun in my back.
- That's right.

1009
01:09:07,676 --> 01:09:12,613
Is this the man you saw
shoot down McTavish and Col. Cobb?

1010
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:14,475
That's him.

1011
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:18,614
Allow me to cross-examine the witness,
Mr. Slocum.

1012
01:09:18,854 --> 01:09:20,116
Are you sure, sir?

1013
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:23,085
Dead certain!

1014
01:09:32,134 --> 01:09:34,068
- Where's the rope?
- Here.

1015
01:09:39,408 --> 01:09:43,572
- Wait a minute. Who do you think you are?
- We're Vigilantes, sir.

1016
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,112
- You're what?
- The Vigilantes.

1017
01:09:45,214 --> 01:09:47,682
We're bringing law and order
to San Francisco.

1018
01:09:47,783 --> 01:09:51,446
What monkey business is this?
I thought there was going to be a trial.

1019
01:09:51,554 --> 01:09:52,851
You have been tried, Knuckles.

1020
01:09:52,955 --> 01:09:55,549
I didn't hear any trial.
There wasn't any judge or jury.

1021
01:09:55,658 --> 01:09:57,819
- Gentlemen, what is your verdict?
- Guilty!

1022
01:09:57,927 --> 01:10:01,522
No, wait a minute. You can't do this.
Get Louis Chamalis.

1023
01:10:19,481 --> 01:10:21,176
- Who done it?
- The Vigilantes!

1024
01:10:21,283 --> 01:10:22,841
They're holding meetings everywhere.

1025
01:10:22,952 --> 01:10:24,442
- Who?
- The Vigilantes.

1026
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:26,817
They've gone crazy. They'll be after us.

1027
01:10:26,922 --> 01:10:29,186
We must get away. They'll hang us like that.

1028
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:31,816
- Stand up, Rubber Knees.
- But Louis!

1029
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:34,795
This is my town and it's going to stay mine.

1030
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:36,489
- But they're too big...
- Shut up!

1031
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:39,862
Climb up there and take him down.

1032
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:42,535
Vigilantes?

1033
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,034
Come on.

1034
01:10:56,452 --> 01:10:58,420
Kind of quiet around here, ain't it?

1035
01:10:58,687 --> 01:11:01,178
Them Vigilantes sure depressed the business.

1036
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:12,196
- What's troubling you?
- I'm feeling pretty low tonight, son.

1037
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:16,237
Seein' Knuckles hangin' up out there,
reminded me I done somethin' I don't like.

1038
01:11:16,338 --> 01:11:18,863
- That's easy to believe.
- You're right.

1039
01:11:18,974 --> 01:11:21,738
I'm a no-good, terrible old man
with the heart of a coyote.

1040
01:11:21,844 --> 01:11:23,573
Yes, I'm certain of it.

1041
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:25,670
I wish you wasn't so ready to believe me.

1042
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:26,645
Why?

1043
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:28,773
It makes it harder to confess.

1044
01:11:28,884 --> 01:11:30,078
Confess what?

1045
01:11:32,021 --> 01:11:33,955
I ain't gonna beat about the bush, then.

1046
01:11:34,056 --> 01:11:37,082
There's one thing that's
botherin' my black soul in particular.

1047
01:11:38,193 --> 01:11:40,491
I found something that don't belong to me.

1048
01:11:40,596 --> 01:11:42,325
There it is, you recognize it?

1049
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:44,724
Somebody dropped it by mistake.

1050
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:48,035
- That's mine.
- I was wondering.

1051
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:49,430
Where did you get it?

1052
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:53,608
Off the floor.

1053
01:11:56,512 --> 01:11:58,480
Don't look at me like that, son.

1054
01:11:59,682 --> 01:12:02,412
Say you forgive me. Just say it once.

1055
01:12:03,519 --> 01:12:04,816
Thanks.

1056
01:12:07,022 --> 01:12:09,855
It's the first decent thing
I've done in my whole black life.

1057
01:12:09,958 --> 01:12:11,653
Sort of overwhelms me.

1058
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:17,155
I feel like a little white kitten, reborn.

1059
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,493
- May I reward you, sir?
- The reward.

1060
01:12:20,602 --> 01:12:24,436
I took that out myself in advance so as not
to delay matters with any bickering.

1061
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:25,666
I see.

1062
01:12:28,944 --> 01:12:30,434
Thanks again.

1063
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:38,019
Looks like the fog's gonna lift
and that boat'll be sailin'.

1064
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,020
- You shippin' on it?
- Yes.

1065
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:44,715
Hate to see you go, son,
but things'll be more suitable in the East.

1066
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,656
For poets and failures.

1067
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:07,773
He's goin' away, Swan.

1068
01:13:08,283 --> 01:13:10,751
This is the second time we say goodbye.

1069
01:13:11,186 --> 01:13:12,676
I'm sailing after all.

1070
01:13:14,356 --> 01:13:16,449
I thought you didn't have your boat fare.

1071
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:20,119
It seems that this old gentleman
rescued some of my loot the other night.

1072
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:22,891
It dropped under the table in the excitement.

1073
01:13:22,998 --> 01:13:27,128
And so with a bag of gold, the prodigal
returns to Gramercy Park, licked.

1074
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:30,065
There won't be any bands to play,
if that's what you mean.

1075
01:13:30,172 --> 01:13:31,901
Or any poems to write.

1076
01:13:32,007 --> 01:13:36,501
No, I guess not. I won't have much time
for writing poetry and...

1077
01:13:36,678 --> 01:13:39,010
Anyhow, I kind of run out of subject matter.

1078
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:43,245
Write about a harpy
who smiled at you and cheated you.

1079
01:13:43,352 --> 01:13:44,819
Write about that.

1080
01:13:45,854 --> 01:13:49,051
That's what you believe, isn't it?
That I'm a cheat.

1081
01:13:49,892 --> 01:13:51,826
No. I don't believe that.

1082
01:13:52,694 --> 01:13:55,993
Then why are you crawling out
without giving yourself another chance?

1083
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:58,430
He's just got enough for another ticket,
let him go!

1084
01:13:58,534 --> 01:14:01,162
That's no way for a man to go,
to crawl out of the West...

1085
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:02,794
...just for the price of a ticket.

1086
01:14:02,905 --> 01:14:05,840
- Not when there's still a chance.
- Now listen, I'm agin' it!

1087
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:09,843
Go away thinking that I stole your money
and sent you back, licked and broke.

1088
01:14:13,248 --> 01:14:15,512
- I'll try the black again.
- Son, it's pure folly.

1089
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:16,982
Weigh it for him, Bill.

1090
01:14:17,085 --> 01:14:19,519
The gentleman from Gramercy Park
bets on the black.

1091
01:14:20,022 --> 01:14:20,920
Here it goes.

1092
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:23,958
This teaches me.
I'll never do a good deed again.

1093
01:14:24,059 --> 01:14:26,527
You're stakin' your whole future
on a ball rollin'.

1094
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:27,754
It's an outrage.

1095
01:14:28,497 --> 01:14:31,057
It's not much of a future, win or lose.

1096
01:14:33,769 --> 01:14:37,796
- 17, on the black.
- Moses in the mountain! You win!

1097
01:14:37,906 --> 01:14:40,466
- How much did he have, Bill?
- $320.

1098
01:14:41,176 --> 01:14:45,374
- Are you letting it ride, Mr. Carmichael?
- I don't know. I...

1099
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:48,314
The play is made, here it goes.

1100
01:14:49,051 --> 01:14:51,645
Snatch it up, son, while there's time.

1101
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:01,420
22 on the black.

1102
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:04,294
Sufferin' Moses! You win again.
I can't believe it!

1103
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:06,890
- Make your play, sir.
- Pick it up, son.

1104
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:09,027
- Here it goes.
- Pick it up. It's on a number.

1105
01:15:09,137 --> 01:15:13,130
- Are you leaving it on the number?
- Son, it's a million to one, I tell you.

1106
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,978
You'll write something
about the fog, won't you?

1107
01:15:17,145 --> 01:15:21,605
About how people forget where they are
and who they are?

1108
01:15:23,552 --> 01:15:27,420
13 and it's black.
You won again, Mr. Carmichael.

1109
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:29,047
A bonanza!

1110
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:31,622
Pay off, Bill. The game is closed.

1111
01:15:31,727 --> 01:15:33,058
Do I win all that?

1112
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:36,824
The Bella Donna pays 35-to-1
on a number, always, Mr. Carmichael.

1113
01:15:36,932 --> 01:15:39,230
Hurry, Bill. Get him on the boat.

1114
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:40,335
I'll take him.

1115
01:15:40,435 --> 01:15:43,563
- I don't know quite what to say.
- Say it to somebody else, not me.

1116
01:15:43,672 --> 01:15:46,835
I've seen quite enough of you
for one day or for one lifetime.

1117
01:15:50,412 --> 01:15:54,815
I'm afraid, Mr. Carmichael,
I'm not as good a loser as you were.

1118
01:15:56,618 --> 01:15:59,348
Come on, son, don't stand around now.

1119
01:16:05,961 --> 01:16:08,293
You know the purpose of
organizing the Vigilantes?

1120
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:10,262
- I do.
- Sign here.

1121
01:16:13,635 --> 01:16:16,103
- What do we do first?
- Get Chamalis.

1122
01:16:16,204 --> 01:16:17,671
That's fine by me.

1123
01:16:20,108 --> 01:16:22,872
- The guns are in there. Pass 'em around.
- All right, Boss.

1124
01:16:22,978 --> 01:16:24,411
Law and order?

1125
01:16:24,513 --> 01:16:26,378
Here are my orders
and don't get 'em wrong.

1126
01:16:26,481 --> 01:16:28,642
Find out where these Vigilantes are meeting.

1127
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:30,615
- What are you going to do?
- Set fire to the city.

1128
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:33,017
Burn down every building
with a Vigilante in it.

1129
01:16:33,121 --> 01:16:34,918
- There's a wind coming.
- It's blowing the right way.

1130
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:37,856
Just a minute. We'll need plenty of money.

1131
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:41,157
- How much have you downstairs, Bill?
- We ain't got much.

1132
01:16:41,863 --> 01:16:43,228
What do you mean?

1133
01:16:45,734 --> 01:16:47,429
You tell him, Swan.

1134
01:16:48,637 --> 01:16:50,969
- What happened?
- We lost.

1135
01:16:51,073 --> 01:16:52,836
- What table?
- Mine.

1136
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:54,234
How much?

1137
01:16:54,776 --> 01:16:56,141
Bill counted it out.

1138
01:16:56,712 --> 01:16:58,839
A little over $40,000.

1139
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:02,343
- Who ran the wheel?
- I did.

1140
01:17:04,219 --> 01:17:08,019
Go on, boys, you've got your orders.
I'll be along. You stay here.

1141
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:13,127
Who was he, Swan?

1142
01:17:14,363 --> 01:17:15,523
A Mr. Carmichael.

1143
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:16,962
Who's that?

1144
01:17:17,566 --> 01:17:18,897
One of your employees.

1145
01:17:19,001 --> 01:17:21,265
The fellow with all them fancy words.

1146
01:17:23,505 --> 01:17:25,200
So that's him?

1147
01:17:25,707 --> 01:17:28,232
That's the fellow you traded me in for.

1148
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:30,043
Where is he, Swan?

1149
01:17:30,345 --> 01:17:32,711
- Gone.
- Gone?

1150
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:35,811
Listen.

1151
01:17:36,084 --> 01:17:39,076
I'm going out and bring your little friend
back to see you again.

1152
01:17:39,187 --> 01:17:42,554
I'm bringing him back
so that you can listen to his pretty poetry.

1153
01:17:43,692 --> 01:17:47,287
Lock her in and keep her waiting
till I come back with her sweetheart.

1154
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:50,923
You heard what he said.

1155
01:18:25,901 --> 01:18:29,200
- Mr. Chamalis is looking for you, sir.
- I was told.

1156
01:18:29,304 --> 01:18:31,829
I don't think this is
quite the place for you to hide.

1157
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:33,168
I'm not hiding.

1158
01:18:33,809 --> 01:18:37,404
- Then what do you want?
- I don't know.

1159
01:18:37,579 --> 01:18:40,139
Don't you understand?
They're outside that door.

1160
01:18:40,248 --> 01:18:42,910
He's looking for you to kill you!
He's out there.

1161
01:18:43,018 --> 01:18:44,042
He's going to kill you.

1162
01:18:44,152 --> 01:18:45,949
Why should he want to do that?

1163
01:18:46,288 --> 01:18:48,483
Because he's mad. Crazy mad.

1164
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:51,923
Because he's laboring under the delusion
that I'm in love with you.

1165
01:18:52,027 --> 01:18:53,051
Are you?

1166
01:18:54,596 --> 01:18:56,188
You must be mad, too.

1167
01:18:56,298 --> 01:18:59,062
I'm much worse than that, I'm stupid.

1168
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:03,164
Love is the only thing I've thought of
or read about since I was knee-high.

1169
01:19:03,271 --> 01:19:07,173
That's what I've always dreamed of,
meeting somebody and falling in love.

1170
01:19:07,275 --> 01:19:10,938
When that thing happened, I was going
to recite poetry to her for hours...

1171
01:19:11,046 --> 01:19:13,071
...about how her heart's an angel's wing...

1172
01:19:13,181 --> 01:19:15,411
...her hair the strings of a heavenly harp.

1173
01:19:15,517 --> 01:19:20,284
Instead I got drunk,
and hollered at her and called her a harpy.

1174
01:19:20,655 --> 01:19:22,282
I'm pretty stupid.

1175
01:19:23,258 --> 01:19:24,520
I love you.

1176
01:19:29,498 --> 01:19:31,728
Why are doing this to me?

1177
01:19:32,501 --> 01:19:36,437
Why did you come back to hurt me,
make me cry?

1178
01:19:37,239 --> 01:19:40,037
Please go. Thank you.

1179
01:19:40,342 --> 01:19:44,369
Thank you for being
what I thought you were, nice.

1180
01:19:45,747 --> 01:19:48,910
- You're coming back with me.
- No.

1181
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:50,577
I love you.

1182
01:19:52,821 --> 01:19:54,652
That's why I can't come.

1183
01:19:54,856 --> 01:19:57,086
If you just wanted Swan,
it would be different.

1184
01:19:57,192 --> 01:19:59,922
But you want somebody
that doesn't exist anymore.

1185
01:20:00,695 --> 01:20:04,825
I stole your money. I gave it back to you,
and that pleased you, that's all it is.

1186
01:20:04,933 --> 01:20:06,161
It pleased you.

1187
01:20:06,268 --> 01:20:08,793
I wasn't as bad as you thought.

1188
01:20:10,705 --> 01:20:13,697
You must go.
They're looking for you. They'll kill you!

1189
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:17,370
You're wasting a lot of time talking
because you're coming with me.

1190
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:18,446
No.

1191
01:20:19,981 --> 01:20:22,313
You're dreaming of something that isn't me.

1192
01:20:23,218 --> 01:20:27,382
- You'd look at me some day and...
- I'm looking at you now.

1193
01:20:28,623 --> 01:20:31,387
I'm no good, do you hear?

1194
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:36,329
Don't make me say it again.
Too much has happened to me.

1195
01:20:36,431 --> 01:20:38,592
It happened to Swan, not you. Listen.

1196
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:41,328
There's something inside of people
that can't be touched.

1197
01:20:41,436 --> 01:20:46,237
They can stand in mud up to their necks,
but that thing inside stays bright, shining.

1198
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:49,606
- I want to believe you.
- You must believe me because it's true.

1199
01:20:49,711 --> 01:20:54,648
Loving wipes out everything else.
All this never existed. You'll see.

1200
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:57,775
Are you sure? No. Don't tell me.

1201
01:20:57,886 --> 01:21:01,151
Even if you aren't sure,
even if it isn't true...

1202
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:03,515
Take me with you.

1203
01:21:05,093 --> 01:21:08,028
Stay where you are! Keep quiet
and nobody's going to get hurt.

1204
01:21:08,129 --> 01:21:09,562
Where's Chamalis?

1205
01:21:20,308 --> 01:21:21,866
Here he is, found him by the inlet.

1206
01:21:21,977 --> 01:21:23,274
Come here!

1207
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:26,108
- Where'd that windbag go?
- I ain't got no conception...

1208
01:21:26,214 --> 01:21:28,944
- He was seen with you.
- I was tryin' to collect some money.

1209
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:30,017
What did he say?

1210
01:21:30,118 --> 01:21:31,585
When I was grapplin' with him...

1211
01:21:31,686 --> 01:21:35,053
...I slipped in the mud and he on top of me
like 20 wildcats clawin'...

1212
01:21:35,156 --> 01:21:38,421
The Vigilantes came in looking for you!
They're bustin' the place!

1213
01:21:38,526 --> 01:21:40,391
- Where's Swan?
- She got away.

1214
01:21:40,495 --> 01:21:42,759
I seen her running through the fog
with somebody.

1215
01:21:42,864 --> 01:21:44,957
I took the other window. Listen, boss...

1216
01:21:45,066 --> 01:21:49,469
Shut up! She went with that fellow?
She'll try coming around to the boat.

1217
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:51,505
But she's too smart to come down this way.

1218
01:21:51,606 --> 01:21:52,664
But, Boss. Listen...

1219
01:21:52,774 --> 01:21:55,868
Shut up! She'll probably try
rowing around to the off side.

1220
01:21:55,977 --> 01:21:58,639
We'll get some boats.
You stay here and watch the wharf.

1221
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:00,214
- What about them?
- Stay here.

1222
01:22:00,315 --> 01:22:02,146
Come on, we'll get some boats.

1223
01:22:05,553 --> 01:22:08,954
- Right where Old Atrocity said it would be.
- Bless his heart.

1224
01:22:09,524 --> 01:22:11,185
Hurry, darling.

1225
01:22:19,868 --> 01:22:23,031
You just sit there and steer.
Say port or starboard and I'll obey.

1226
01:22:24,005 --> 01:22:25,097
Do you still love me?

1227
01:22:25,206 --> 01:22:27,936
Ask me that when I'm an old woman
with gray hair.

1228
01:22:28,043 --> 01:22:30,273
I'll tell you I haven't
begun to love you yet.

1229
01:22:31,179 --> 01:22:33,204
I'll have to wear this dress
for three months.

1230
01:22:33,315 --> 01:22:35,875
- You'll get tired of it.
- We'll put it in a museum.

1231
01:22:35,984 --> 01:22:37,849
There's a good one in Hoboken.

1232
01:22:39,854 --> 01:22:43,654
- I thought I heard something.
- No, that was me, flying through the air.

1233
01:22:45,393 --> 01:22:47,384
Head straight for the big boat.

1234
01:22:47,762 --> 01:22:49,161
Row carefully, darling.

1235
01:22:49,264 --> 01:22:51,926
He'll figure out where we're going
and come after us.

1236
01:22:52,033 --> 01:22:54,524
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

1237
01:22:54,703 --> 01:22:58,104
But I wish I had some other dress on.
I must look so foolish.

1238
01:22:58,206 --> 01:23:02,939
It would take me from here to China
and back to tell you how you look...

1239
01:23:04,212 --> 01:23:05,736
I heard something.

1240
01:23:07,082 --> 01:23:08,845
That's a bird hunting for fish.

1241
01:23:10,552 --> 01:23:13,953
We've turned the wrong way.
Starboard, Mr. Carmichael, darling.

1242
01:23:14,055 --> 01:23:16,387
It's hard rowing when you're so emotional.

1243
01:23:18,526 --> 01:23:20,619
Darling, where's your money?

1244
01:23:21,196 --> 01:23:24,529
Lordy, I forgot.
I left it right outside your window.

1245
01:23:24,632 --> 01:23:27,100
That's the most idiotic thing I've ever done.

1246
01:23:27,202 --> 01:23:29,762
- $30,000.
- $40,000, darling.

1247
01:23:29,871 --> 01:23:31,862
- Do you mind?
- I don't mind anything.

1248
01:23:31,973 --> 01:23:35,033
Same here.
I'm rowing out of the Golden West with...

1249
01:23:36,811 --> 01:23:38,403
I heard something.

1250
01:23:39,447 --> 01:23:42,245
Someone's rowing over there. Listen.

1251
01:23:44,285 --> 01:23:46,150
Keep pulling, you weasel.

1252
01:23:47,722 --> 01:23:49,713
- Chamalis.
- Don't mind.

1253
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:51,347
I don't.

1254
01:23:53,094 --> 01:23:56,757
I take it back about not liking the fog.
I'm very fond of fog.

1255
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:57,889
So am I.

1256
01:24:00,835 --> 01:24:02,769
They're moving in the same direction.

1257
01:24:04,139 --> 01:24:06,266
Darling, the fog is thinning.

1258
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:09,502
- Is it?
- A little. Here comes the moon.

1259
01:24:09,611 --> 01:24:11,772
This is one poet that hates the moon.

1260
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:18,682
There they are, boss.

1261
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:21,186
Pull to the left. Pull hard.

1262
01:24:21,689 --> 01:24:24,249
They've heard us. They're coming this way.

1263
01:24:26,094 --> 01:24:27,618
Don't, you fool, you'll hit her.

1264
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:29,253
Get down!

1265
01:24:29,364 --> 01:24:31,559
I'll never forgive that moon.
Are you all right?

1266
01:24:31,666 --> 01:24:34,533
I'm very frightened, but otherwise...
Can you row any faster?

1267
01:24:34,636 --> 01:24:35,603
I'll try.

1268
01:24:36,037 --> 01:24:39,097
- Jim, I love you.
- I adore you.

1269
01:24:39,207 --> 01:24:40,674
Whatever happens...

1270
01:24:41,376 --> 01:24:43,241
- What is it?
- A little accident.

1271
01:24:43,344 --> 01:24:45,778
We can't make it, Jim.
Jump over, you can swim.

1272
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:47,438
Get down.

1273
01:24:51,886 --> 01:24:54,116
You hit him. Keep pulling.

1274
01:25:03,665 --> 01:25:06,099
- Do you see them?
- No.

1275
01:25:19,881 --> 01:25:21,348
Here, darling.

1276
01:25:21,616 --> 01:25:22,844
I'm not much help, I...

1277
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:25,920
That's all right, but hurry, come, darling.

1278
01:25:31,092 --> 01:25:34,687
- Mary.
- Darling, they're coming.

1279
01:25:37,665 --> 01:25:39,656
They landed somewhere around here.

1280
01:25:40,502 --> 01:25:42,697
- Can you see them?
- Keep quiet.

1281
01:25:43,771 --> 01:25:45,432
Mary, you go on.

1282
01:25:45,707 --> 01:25:47,334
Quiet, everybody. Listen.

1283
01:25:54,482 --> 01:25:56,245
You thought you'd get away?

1284
01:25:56,618 --> 01:26:00,281
- The moon was on your side.
- Wait.

1285
01:26:00,388 --> 01:26:02,288
Get out of the way.
I'm going to put him out of his misery.

1286
01:26:02,390 --> 01:26:04,221
Before you shoot, listen to me!

1287
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:08,386
You wanted me to love you. You held me
in your arms and asked me to love you.

1288
01:26:08,496 --> 01:26:12,455
Do you still want it?
If you do, I will. I'll love you.

1289
01:26:12,567 --> 01:26:14,125
Don't kill him. Let him go.

1290
01:26:14,235 --> 01:26:17,932
Let him go and I'll love you
the way you've always wanted me to.

1291
01:26:18,039 --> 01:26:19,904
I'll forget him, I swear I will.

1292
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:22,476
He's never even touched me.
He's never even kissed me.

1293
01:26:22,577 --> 01:26:23,544
Let him go?

1294
01:26:23,645 --> 01:26:25,135
- He's never touched you?
- No.

1295
01:26:25,246 --> 01:26:27,714
On account of him, you'll feel for me
like I've always wanted you to?

1296
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:30,715
- On account of him?
- Not just on account of him...

1297
01:26:30,818 --> 01:26:33,218
...but if you do this, you'll be a fine man.

1298
01:26:33,321 --> 01:26:35,687
You'll be the kind of a man
that a woman could love.

1299
01:26:35,790 --> 01:26:38,850
- How do I know that you'll do that?
- Because I give you my word.

1300
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:42,054
Not Swan's word but the word of someone
you haven't known yet.

1301
01:26:42,163 --> 01:26:44,290
Somebody you'll like much better than Swan.

1302
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:47,733
I'll do it. I got to do it.

1303
01:26:48,102 --> 01:26:49,933
That's what I want.

1304
01:26:50,538 --> 01:26:52,199
Come here. Pick him up.

1305
01:26:52,307 --> 01:26:53,740
- What for?
- Pick him up.

1306
01:26:53,841 --> 01:26:56,002
Throw him on that boat.
I want him on that boat!

1307
01:26:56,110 --> 01:26:59,102
There are lots of people in this town
trying to give me orders, but you ain't.

1308
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:02,706
- Do what I told you.
- Thank you, Louis. Be careful.

1309
01:27:10,291 --> 01:27:11,315
He'll make it.

1310
01:27:11,426 --> 01:27:14,088
We'll have him on his feet
before he lands in New York.

1311
01:27:14,195 --> 01:27:17,562
- The tide's changing, sir.
- Folks, you'd better be saying goodbye.

1312
01:27:17,665 --> 01:27:18,859
We are sailing.

1313
01:27:20,268 --> 01:27:21,735
Goodbye, son.

1314
01:27:22,503 --> 01:27:23,492
Goodbye.

1315
01:27:23,771 --> 01:27:27,707
You left something outside the window.
I gave it all to the Captain.

1316
01:27:27,809 --> 01:27:29,800
There was five bags.

1317
01:27:30,712 --> 01:27:34,204
Can you imagine. I must have missed this one.

1318
01:27:34,315 --> 01:27:35,873
Goodbye, son.

1319
01:27:36,951 --> 01:27:38,111
Mary.

1320
01:27:42,423 --> 01:27:43,651
Yes, Jim.

1321
01:27:43,891 --> 01:27:45,222
We made it.

1322
01:27:46,394 --> 01:27:49,227
Be quiet, darling. Don't talk.

1323
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:52,595
Nothing can ever come between us anymore.

1324
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:53,826
No.

1325
01:27:54,702 --> 01:27:56,465
Go to sleep, darling.

1326
01:27:58,306 --> 01:28:02,265
Lay aloft. Unfold the topsails.

1327
01:28:07,315 --> 01:28:09,306
We'll take good care of him, miss.

1328
01:28:12,186 --> 01:28:13,483
Come on.

1329
01:28:22,730 --> 01:28:25,358
- Thank you, Louis.
- You did thank me.

1330
01:28:25,466 --> 01:28:29,027
Thank you again, and I'll always thank you.

1331
01:28:29,871 --> 01:28:31,930
You'll never regret it, I swear it.

1332
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:34,338
So that's the way a woman looks
when she's in love.

1333
01:28:34,442 --> 01:28:35,670
Hurry, Louis, don't stop.

1334
01:28:35,777 --> 01:28:38,439
And that's the way she cries
when she loves somebody.

1335
01:28:39,213 --> 01:28:41,841
- Hurry, please.
- Wait a minute.

1336
01:28:42,350 --> 01:28:44,045
You're going to love me now.

1337
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:49,021
- You're going to look like that for me.
- Yes. I'm going to keep my word.

1338
01:28:49,757 --> 01:28:52,123
You're never going to regret it.

1339
01:28:52,794 --> 01:28:56,321
I'm never going to regret it
because I'm never going to see you again.

1340
01:28:56,597 --> 01:29:00,363
I don't take presents off spittoon cleaners.
I don't take presents off anybody.

1341
01:29:00,468 --> 01:29:01,560
I give 'em.

1342
01:29:04,038 --> 01:29:07,098
I've got things to do here
without tying myself up to somebody...

1343
01:29:07,208 --> 01:29:09,676
...who's going to cry for somebody else
all the time.

1344
01:29:09,811 --> 01:29:11,676
What's the matter? You understand English?

1345
01:29:11,813 --> 01:29:14,247
Go on back to him now.

1346
01:29:16,117 --> 01:29:17,948
Chamalis, we want you.

1347
01:29:20,888 --> 01:29:22,082
All right.

1348
01:29:25,059 --> 01:29:28,085
What are you standing there for? Say goodbye?

1349
01:29:28,963 --> 01:29:30,260
All right.

1350
01:29:31,466 --> 01:29:33,331
Is that the way a gentleman does it?

1351
01:29:35,737 --> 01:29:36,965
Come on.

1352
01:29:37,305 --> 01:29:43,791
