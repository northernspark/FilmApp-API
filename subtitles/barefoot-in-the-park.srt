* Going... *

3
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:34,299
* Where it says
keep off the grass *

4
00:00:34,379 --> 00:00:41,538
* Isn't recommended
for the very old *

5
00:00:42,858 --> 00:00:46,297
* But when you're young
and you're in love *

6
00:00:46,377 --> 00:00:49,897
* The world is beautiful *

7
00:00:49,977 --> 00:00:56,776
* And I'm not a bit afraid
of you catching cold *

8
00:00:57,576 --> 00:01:00,855
* Running barefoot
through the park *

9
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:04,455
* Searching bareheaded
in the rain *

10
00:01:04,535 --> 00:01:07,574
* For a midwinter daisy *

11
00:01:07,654 --> 00:01:12,054
* Seems kind of crazy
to do *

12
00:01:12,134 --> 00:01:16,173
* But come along,
my barefoot love *

13
00:01:16,253 --> 00:01:18,973
* To the fields
that shine with spring *

14
00:01:19,053 --> 00:01:20,733
We just got married!

15
00:01:20,813 --> 00:01:21,932
* Though it's 10 below *

16
00:01:22,012 --> 00:01:26,612
* Let me go knee-deep
in daisies with you *

17
00:01:27,812 --> 00:01:28,931
* La la la... *

18
00:01:28,971 --> 00:01:32,251
They just got married.

Whoa!

26
00:02:10,636 --> 00:02:13,235
This is the Plaza Hotel,
please.

27
00:02:13,228 --> 00:02:14,488
Corie, it's the Plaza.

28
00:02:14,524 --> 00:02:16,072
Wait a minute.
I'm not finished.

29
00:02:16,144 --> 00:02:17,404
Corie, the man
is waiting.

30
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,700
Give him a big tip.

31
00:02:18,736 --> 00:02:21,292
Paul, tell me you're not sorry
we got married.

32
00:02:21,328 --> 00:02:22,588
After 40 minutes?

33
00:02:22,624 --> 00:02:25,179
Let's give it
a couple of hours first.

34
00:02:25,215 --> 00:02:26,907
If the honeymoon
doesn't work out,

35
00:02:26,943 --> 00:02:28,203
let's not get divorced.

36
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,499
Let's kill each other.

37
00:02:29,535 --> 00:02:31,227
Let's have
a maid do it.

38
00:02:31,263 --> 00:02:32,955
I hear the service
here's wonderful.

39
00:02:38,174 --> 00:02:39,110
Uh...

40
00:02:42,891 --> 00:02:43,827
Here's...

41
00:02:43,899 --> 00:02:45,266
Thank you.

42
00:02:45,338 --> 00:02:46,274
Come on.

43
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:06,721
Good afternoon.

44
00:03:06,793 --> 00:03:08,341
Yes.

45
00:03:08,377 --> 00:03:10,500
My hand.
I need my hand.

46
00:03:14,713 --> 00:03:15,937
"Mr. Paul Bratter. "

47
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:16,944
Yes.

48
00:03:17,016 --> 00:03:18,924
Is Mrs. Bratter
staying with you?

49
00:03:20,315 --> 00:03:21,349
My mother?

50
00:03:21,428 --> 00:03:22,780
Oh! Mrs. Bratter, yes.

51
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:24,170
Mr. And Mrs. Bratter.

52
00:03:25,403 --> 00:03:28,662
How long will you
be staying with us, Mr. Bratter?

53
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:29,775
Six days.

54
00:03:29,855 --> 00:03:30,888
And nights.

55
00:03:30,968 --> 00:03:34,226
It's a pleasure
to have you at the Plaza.

56
00:03:34,306 --> 00:03:35,260
449.

57
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,721
Ha ha ha!

58
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:52,827
Come on.
Corie, let's stop.

59
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,921
This way, please.

60
00:03:56,961 --> 00:03:59,306
Ex-excuse me.
Excuse us, please.

61
00:03:59,346 --> 00:04:03,121
Mr. Adams, I hope you realize
I'm only 15 years old.

62
00:04:04,155 --> 00:04:05,507
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.

63
00:04:05,586 --> 00:04:06,938
They're so stuffy
around here.

64
00:04:07,016 --> 00:04:09,799
Is this what life
is going to be like

65
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:11,230
for the next
50 years?

66
00:04:11,309 --> 00:04:14,568
Is that all we're going
to be married, 50 years?

67
00:04:14,647 --> 00:04:15,999
That's not very long.

68
00:04:16,078 --> 00:04:17,430
Wait. Don't make
rash judgments.

69
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:20,769
I think I'm going
to be a lousy wife.

70
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:22,199
Don't be angry with me.

71
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:24,107
I love you very much,

72
00:04:24,187 --> 00:04:25,538
and I'm very sexy.

73
00:04:25,618 --> 00:04:26,969
Then let's go inside.

74
00:04:27,049 --> 00:04:28,876
I'm paying $30 a day.

75
00:04:28,956 --> 00:04:31,738
O.K., Paul,
let's start the marriage.

76
00:04:31,818 --> 00:04:33,607
Good luck, Paul.

77
00:04:33,646 --> 00:04:35,276
Good luck, Corie.

78
00:04:59,878 --> 00:05:01,747
Forget it. They're
never coming out.

79
00:05:01,786 --> 00:05:03,655
How long
has it been now?

80
00:05:03,694 --> 00:05:04,767
Five days.

81
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:07,152
Whew! That must be
a hotel record.

82
00:05:07,191 --> 00:05:08,583
For a political
convention.

83
00:05:08,623 --> 00:05:10,968
A honeymoon record
is nine days.

84
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,301
Wait a minute, Paul!

85
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:22,732
Where are you going?

86
00:05:22,772 --> 00:05:24,640
Work.
I have to go to work.

87
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,501
I don't do this
for a living, you know.

88
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:28,932
Can't you call in sick?

89
00:05:28,972 --> 00:05:30,761
I am sick,
but I have to go.

90
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,622
Last night you promised
you'd never leave me.

91
00:05:33,702 --> 00:05:35,053
It's just till 5:30.

92
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:38,392
If it's a good marriage,
it'll last until 5:30.

93
00:05:39,426 --> 00:05:40,458
See ya.

94
00:05:40,538 --> 00:05:41,571
Tonight, hey?

95
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,069
What was that?

96
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:46,659
A kiss?

97
00:05:46,739 --> 00:05:49,560
Would you get inside?
It's a nice hotel.

98
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,031
Was that a kiss?

99
00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:53,893
If that's what kisses
are going to be like,

100
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:55,641
don't bother coming back
at 5:30.

101
00:05:55,681 --> 00:05:57,072
I can't kiss you
anymore.

102
00:05:57,112 --> 00:05:59,338
My lips are numb.
Now will you please go inside.

103
00:05:59,418 --> 00:06:02,199
If you don't give me
a real kiss,

104
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,584
I'm going to give you back
your pajamas.

105
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:05,896
Right now.

106
00:06:05,976 --> 00:06:07,844
N...

107
00:06:07,923 --> 00:06:08,957
W...

108
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,069
Wait!

109
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:20,841
Couldn't you
make it 4:30?

110
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,954
Ahem!

111
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:23,067
Oh!

112
00:06:23,146 --> 00:06:24,179
Tonight.

113
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,610
At the new apartment.

114
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:26,961
It's 49 West 10th Street.

115
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,432
I love you!

116
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:29,505
Yeah. Uh.

117
00:06:39,998 --> 00:06:41,270
Thank you, Mr. Dooley.

118
00:06:43,059 --> 00:06:44,927
Next time
you're in New York,

119
00:06:44,967 --> 00:06:46,079
just call me up.

120
00:09:45,411 --> 00:09:46,485
Hello?

121
00:09:46,564 --> 00:09:48,909
Bratter?

122
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:51,135
Up here, top floor!

123
00:09:52,804 --> 00:09:53,848
Top floor.

124
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:55,293
Take your time!

125
00:09:55,374 --> 00:09:57,140
Yeah.

126
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:00,753
Top floor.

127
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,760
It's always
the top floor.

128
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,419
Whatever happened
to elevators?

129
00:10:43,465 --> 00:10:46,276
Let's see.
The bed is 6 feet long

130
00:10:46,356 --> 00:10:48,685
and the room
is 51/2 feet

131
00:10:48,765 --> 00:10:50,691
and I'm in big trouble.

132
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,183
Tele...

133
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,435
Hi. Teleph...

134
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,683
Telephone company.

135
00:11:10,764 --> 00:11:11,808
The phone?

136
00:11:11,887 --> 00:11:12,931
Yeah.

137
00:11:13,011 --> 00:11:14,778
Oh, great!
Come on in.

138
00:11:14,858 --> 00:11:16,705
That's... that's
quite a climb.

139
00:11:16,785 --> 00:11:20,076
Yes. Five flights,
if you don't count the front stoop.

140
00:11:20,157 --> 00:11:22,003
Yeah, I counted
the front stoop.

141
00:11:22,084 --> 00:11:24,894
Uh, would you like
a glass of water?

142
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,018
Please.

143
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:28,426
I'd offer you soda
or a beer,

144
00:11:28,507 --> 00:11:30,354
but we don't have
anything yet.

145
00:11:30,434 --> 00:11:31,799
A glass
of water's fine.

146
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:34,488
Except we don't have
any glasses either.

147
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,295
Oh.

148
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:37,740
You could, uh...

149
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,948
put your head under
and just schlurp.

150
00:11:39,988 --> 00:11:42,838
Oh, no, I don't have
enough breath to slurp.

151
00:11:42,878 --> 00:11:44,163
Well...

152
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,297
Where would you
like the phone?

153
00:11:48,378 --> 00:11:50,305
Gee, uh...

154
00:11:50,385 --> 00:11:51,750
I don't know.

155
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,195
Any suggestions?

156
00:11:53,276 --> 00:11:54,641
Well, it all depends

157
00:11:54,721 --> 00:11:57,531
on what you're going
to do with the room.

158
00:11:57,611 --> 00:11:59,939
You going to have
furniture in here?

159
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,064
Ha!

160
00:12:01,144 --> 00:12:02,348
Sure.

161
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:05,238
Listen, you can give me
a long extension cord,

162
00:12:05,318 --> 00:12:09,092
and I'll carry it around with me
the first few years.

163
00:12:09,173 --> 00:12:11,420
Good. I'll use
the old connection.

164
00:12:12,946 --> 00:12:14,351
Whew!

165
00:12:14,391 --> 00:12:17,241
You're really going
to live up here, huh?

166
00:12:17,281 --> 00:12:19,288
I mean every day.

167
00:12:19,369 --> 00:12:20,894
Every day.

168
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,229
I hope that's the men
with the furniture.

169
00:12:26,434 --> 00:12:28,361
I don't want to see this.

170
00:12:29,806 --> 00:12:31,613
Hello, Bloomingdale's!

171
00:12:31,693 --> 00:12:33,620
Lord & Taylor's.

172
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,744
Oh.

173
00:12:34,824 --> 00:12:36,992
Up here, top floor!

174
00:12:38,438 --> 00:12:40,002
Oh, my God.

175
00:12:42,893 --> 00:12:45,704
It's probably another wedding gift
from my mother.

176
00:12:45,784 --> 00:12:48,393
She sends wedding gifts
twice a day.

177
00:12:48,473 --> 00:12:50,440
I hope it's
an electric heater.

178
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,247
Is it cold in here?

179
00:12:52,327 --> 00:12:53,691
I can't grip the phone.

180
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,337
Maybe the steam is off.

181
00:12:55,418 --> 00:12:56,783
Maybe that's it.

182
00:12:56,863 --> 00:12:58,228
Just turn it on.

183
00:12:58,308 --> 00:12:59,914
It'll come right up.

184
00:13:05,454 --> 00:13:07,341
It is on.

185
00:13:07,381 --> 00:13:09,628
It's just not
coming up.

186
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:10,753
Oh.

187
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,362
Your husband have
a lot of sweaters?

188
00:13:13,443 --> 00:13:14,808
I prefer it this way.

189
00:13:14,888 --> 00:13:18,541
It's a medical fact
that steam heat's bad for you.

190
00:13:18,621 --> 00:13:20,508
Yeah? In February?

191
00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:28,055
Just put them down
anywhere.

192
00:13:30,463 --> 00:13:31,828
I know. I know.

193
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:36,124
Oh, I'm terribly sorry
about the stairs.

194
00:13:41,061 --> 00:13:44,153
I think he wants you
to sign it.

195
00:13:44,233 --> 00:13:45,276
Oh.

196
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:52,221
Oh, wait a minute.

197
00:13:58,404 --> 00:13:59,768
There you are.

198
00:13:59,848 --> 00:14:02,177
Are you going
to be all right?

199
00:14:09,884 --> 00:14:11,249
That's a shame,

200
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:14,139
giving a job like that
to an old man.

201
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,585
He's probably
only 25.

202
00:14:15,665 --> 00:14:17,512
They age fast
on this route.

203
00:14:17,592 --> 00:14:19,439
O.K., lady,
you're in business.

204
00:14:22,891 --> 00:14:24,256
My own phone.

205
00:14:24,336 --> 00:14:26,183
Can I make
a call yet?

206
00:14:26,263 --> 00:14:28,109
Your bill started
two minutes ago.

207
00:14:28,189 --> 00:14:29,555
Who can I call?

208
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:32,445
Oh, by the way,
my name is Harry Pepper.

209
00:14:32,526 --> 00:14:34,372
If you ever have
phone trouble,

210
00:14:34,453 --> 00:14:37,744
do me a favor...
don't ask for Harry Pepper.

211
00:14:38,788 --> 00:14:40,153
What's the matter,
bad news?

212
00:14:40,233 --> 00:14:43,524
It's going to be cloudy tonight
with a light snow.

213
00:14:43,605 --> 00:14:45,933
You'll be the first
in the city

214
00:14:46,014 --> 00:14:47,343
to see it fall.

215
00:15:34,251 --> 00:15:36,619
Hello, is Mr. Paul Bratter
there, please?

216
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:38,545
This is Mrs. Paul Bratter
calling.

217
00:15:38,585 --> 00:15:41,154
This is terrific.
It works just great.

218
00:15:41,234 --> 00:15:42,718
Just like
a real phone, huh?

219
00:15:44,163 --> 00:15:47,053
Frank, is Paul there?

220
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:48,176
Hi, Corie.

221
00:15:48,256 --> 00:15:50,142
He left
about 20 minutes ago.

222
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:51,586
Looked very tired.

223
00:15:51,627 --> 00:15:54,476
Tell him to call me
when he gets in.

224
00:15:54,516 --> 00:15:55,720
I've got great news.

225
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,686
No kidding, Frank.
What is it?

226
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:03,024
Frank, hang on.
That may be him now.

227
00:16:04,067 --> 00:16:05,913
I didn't
want him to come

228
00:16:05,993 --> 00:16:07,839
till after
the furniture arrived.

229
00:16:10,327 --> 00:16:11,651
Paul?

230
00:16:11,731 --> 00:16:12,775
Corie?

231
00:16:12,855 --> 00:16:14,219
Where are you?

232
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,344
Paul?

233
00:16:15,423 --> 00:16:17,350
Up here!

234
00:16:33,402 --> 00:16:35,809
Paul, up here, top floor!

235
00:16:40,223 --> 00:16:41,587
Oh, it's him!

236
00:16:44,517 --> 00:16:47,327
How long did you say
you were married?

237
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:48,450
Six days.

238
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:51,820
He won't notice
the place is empty till June.

239
00:16:51,901 --> 00:16:53,266
So long,
Grammercy 59971.

240
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,192
Have a nice marriage.

241
00:16:55,272 --> 00:16:56,315
Thank you.

242
00:16:56,395 --> 00:16:58,843
And may you soon
have many extensions.

243
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:03,658
He's on his way up.

244
00:17:03,698 --> 00:17:06,548
Can you hang on
for five more flights?

245
00:17:06,588 --> 00:17:07,671
Paul?

246
00:17:07,751 --> 00:17:09,558
Hurry up, darling!

247
00:17:11,404 --> 00:17:13,283
Now, don't
expect too much,

248
00:17:13,322 --> 00:17:16,680
'cause the furniture
hasn't gotten here yet!

249
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:20,637
And the paint didn't
turn out exactly right,

250
00:17:20,717 --> 00:17:23,674
but I think it's
going to be beautiful!

251
00:17:27,552 --> 00:17:28,630
Paul?

252
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,549
Paul, are you all right?

253
00:17:30,629 --> 00:17:31,668
I'm coming.

254
00:17:31,748 --> 00:17:33,387
I'm coming.

255
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,506
What?

256
00:17:34,546 --> 00:17:35,945
He's coming.
He's coming.

257
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,300
He's coming.
He's coming.

258
00:18:01,725 --> 00:18:03,124
Hi, sweetheart!

259
00:18:04,923 --> 00:18:05,922
Paul, darling!

260
00:18:10,838 --> 00:18:13,117
Oh! Say something.

261
00:18:14,675 --> 00:18:16,954
It's six flights.
Did you...

262
00:18:18,992 --> 00:18:21,311
Did you know
it's six flights?

263
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,229
Well, it isn't.
It's only five.

264
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:25,147
What about
that big thing

265
00:18:25,227 --> 00:18:26,306
hanging outside
the building?

266
00:18:26,346 --> 00:18:28,705
That's not a flight.
It's a stoop.

267
00:18:28,745 --> 00:18:31,103
It may look
like a stoop.

268
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:33,021
It climbs
like a flight.

269
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:35,899
Is that all
you have to say?

270
00:18:35,939 --> 00:18:38,777
I didn't think
I'd get that much out.

271
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:39,896
Oh.

272
00:18:40,935 --> 00:18:42,294
But it didn't...

273
00:18:42,374 --> 00:18:44,692
It didn't seem
like six flights

274
00:18:44,772 --> 00:18:47,091
when I first
saw the apartment.

275
00:18:47,171 --> 00:18:48,529
Why... why is that?

276
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:49,968
You didn't see
this apartment.

277
00:18:50,048 --> 00:18:52,366
Don't you remember?
The woman wasn't home.

278
00:18:52,446 --> 00:18:55,285
You saw the apartment
on the third floor.

279
00:18:55,325 --> 00:18:56,363
That's why.

280
00:18:56,443 --> 00:18:57,802
You don't like it.

281
00:18:57,882 --> 00:18:59,241
I do like it, dear.

282
00:18:59,321 --> 00:19:02,159
I'm just waiting
for my eyes to clear.

283
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:04,037
I thought
you'd say wow!

284
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:05,157
I will.

285
00:19:05,197 --> 00:19:06,596
I will.
I'm just...

286
00:19:07,754 --> 00:19:08,834
You...

287
00:19:22,863 --> 00:19:23,982
Wow.

288
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:27,340
It's going
to be beautiful!

289
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,139
I promise you!

290
00:19:30,057 --> 00:19:31,417
Do you know what?

291
00:19:31,497 --> 00:19:32,536
What?

292
00:19:32,616 --> 00:19:33,934
I missed you.

293
00:19:33,974 --> 00:19:35,054
Really?

294
00:19:35,094 --> 00:19:37,931
In the middle of the
Monday morning conference

295
00:19:37,971 --> 00:19:39,051
I began to...

296
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:43,887
Let's go back
to the Plaza.

297
00:19:43,967 --> 00:19:45,925
We have an hour
till checkout.

298
00:19:46,005 --> 00:19:47,045
We can't.

299
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,164
Why?

300
00:19:48,244 --> 00:19:51,082
We stole a towel
and three ashtrays. We're hot.

301
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:04,951
You know, for a lawyer,
you're some good kisser.

302
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,068
Heh-eh!

303
00:20:08,148 --> 00:20:09,188
What?

304
00:20:09,268 --> 00:20:11,585
For a kisser,
I'm some good lawyer.

305
00:20:11,665 --> 00:20:12,705
Something's happened.

306
00:20:12,785 --> 00:20:14,144
Something's happened.
Tell me!

307
00:20:14,224 --> 00:20:15,582
It's not positive.

308
00:20:15,662 --> 00:20:18,461
The office will call
and let me know.

309
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,299
They called.
I mean I called.

310
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:21,299
When?

311
00:20:21,379 --> 00:20:22,337
Now.

312
00:20:22,417 --> 00:20:23,457
Where?

313
00:20:23,536 --> 00:20:24,896
Over there.
Right now.

314
00:20:24,976 --> 00:20:26,334
You didn't tell me.

315
00:20:26,414 --> 00:20:27,454
I forgot.

316
00:20:27,533 --> 00:20:30,331
You kissed me
and got me all crazy.

317
00:20:30,411 --> 00:20:31,650
Frank. Yes, Frank.
Tell me...

318
00:20:33,688 --> 00:20:35,527
That's very funny,
Frank.

319
00:20:35,607 --> 00:20:38,845
For a lawyer
I'm some good kisser.

320
00:20:38,885 --> 00:20:40,284
I'd love to listen,

321
00:20:40,324 --> 00:20:43,162
but I've got work to do.
You, too.

322
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:45,559
You've a got
a court case tomorrow.

323
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:46,999
Frank, are you kidding?

324
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,438
Do you mean this?

325
00:20:48,478 --> 00:20:50,396
The whole thing?

326
00:20:50,476 --> 00:20:51,835
Birnbaum v. Gump.

327
00:20:51,915 --> 00:20:53,274
Marshall just
dumped the case

328
00:20:53,354 --> 00:20:55,193
in our eager, inexperienced
little hands.

329
00:20:55,273 --> 00:20:59,030
This is our chance for the key
to the executive washroom.

330
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,468
Well, we're a cinch.

331
00:21:00,548 --> 00:21:02,867
I'll go over the briefs
here tonight.

332
00:21:02,947 --> 00:21:06,704
I'll meet you at the office at 8:00
in the morning.

333
00:21:06,784 --> 00:21:09,581
Frank, think I have time
to grow a mustache?

334
00:21:09,661 --> 00:21:11,499
Did you hear?
Did you hear?

335
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:12,939
It's my first case!

336
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:15,178
I'm going to be
a lawyer!

337
00:21:15,257 --> 00:21:16,616
That's great, Paul.

338
00:21:20,293 --> 00:21:22,612
You going to have
to work tonight?

339
00:21:22,692 --> 00:21:24,530
I'm going to go
over the affidavits.

340
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,928
This furrier's suing
a woman for nonpayment.

341
00:21:27,008 --> 00:21:28,367
I've got the furrier.

342
00:21:28,447 --> 00:21:30,286
I have a black
lace nightgown.

343
00:21:30,365 --> 00:21:33,164
He made four coats
for a Park Avenue woman.

344
00:21:33,244 --> 00:21:34,602
She doesn't want them.

345
00:21:34,682 --> 00:21:38,439
She's 4 foot 8. He'd have to sell them
to a rich midget.

346
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:39,878
I'll put on a record

347
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,276
and do an original
Cambodian fertility dance.

348
00:21:42,356 --> 00:21:43,715
There's no
signed contract.

349
00:21:43,795 --> 00:21:45,155
What's happening?
What is this?

350
00:21:45,235 --> 00:21:46,513
What are you doing?

351
00:21:46,593 --> 00:21:49,391
I'm trying to get you
all hot and bothered,

352
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,789
and you're summing up
for the jury.

353
00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:53,228
The whole marriage
is over.

354
00:21:53,308 --> 00:21:54,667
Corie,
honey, I'm sorry.

355
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:56,106
I'm excited,
that's all.

356
00:21:56,186 --> 00:21:59,463
You want me to be
rich and famous, don't you?

357
00:21:59,543 --> 00:22:00,902
During the day.

358
00:22:00,982 --> 00:22:03,780
At night I want you
here and sexy.

359
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,219
I will, I prom...

360
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:06,658
Tomorrow night...
your night.

361
00:22:06,738 --> 00:22:08,576
We'll do whatever
you like, O.K.?

362
00:22:08,656 --> 00:22:10,015
Something wild,
crazy, and insane?

363
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:11,135
Fine.

364
00:22:11,215 --> 00:22:12,253
Like what?

365
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:13,692
I'll come home early.

366
00:22:13,772 --> 00:22:15,132
We'll wallpaper
each other.

367
00:22:15,212 --> 00:22:17,050
Tonight, dear,
I've got to work.

368
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,489
Please, O.K.? O.K.?

369
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:20,087
O.K.

370
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:21,526
So where
do I sit?

371
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:24,404
The furniture will be here
in a minute.

372
00:22:24,484 --> 00:22:26,323
It probably got stuck
in traffic.

373
00:22:26,403 --> 00:22:27,761
What about tonight?

374
00:22:27,841 --> 00:22:29,680
I've got court
in the morning.

375
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,078
Maybe we ought
to check into a hotel.

376
00:22:32,158 --> 00:22:34,477
We just checked out
of a hotel.

377
00:22:34,557 --> 00:22:36,875
I want to sleep
in my own apartment.

378
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:38,314
Where, dear, where?

379
00:22:38,393 --> 00:22:41,192
There's only room
for one in the bathtub.

380
00:22:45,987 --> 00:22:47,387
Where's the bathtub?

381
00:22:47,426 --> 00:22:49,306
There's no bathtub.
There's a shower.

382
00:22:49,346 --> 00:22:51,703
How am I going
to take a bath?

383
00:22:51,743 --> 00:22:53,143
You'll take a shower.

384
00:22:53,183 --> 00:22:55,540
I don't like showers.
I like baths.

385
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,458
How will I
take a bath?

386
00:22:57,498 --> 00:23:00,337
Lie down and hang your feet
over the sink.

387
00:23:00,377 --> 00:23:01,775
Ha ha ha!

388
00:23:01,815 --> 00:23:04,174
You know
it's freezing in here.

389
00:23:04,214 --> 00:23:05,612
Isn't there any heat?

390
00:23:05,652 --> 00:23:07,531
Of course.
There's a radiator.

391
00:23:16,404 --> 00:23:19,243
The radiator's the coolest thing
in the room.

392
00:23:19,283 --> 00:23:21,600
Does the building
have a janitor?

393
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,360
Only Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday.

394
00:23:23,439 --> 00:23:27,237
Paul, it's going to warm up
a lot when the furniture gets here.

395
00:23:27,317 --> 00:23:30,274
What about tonight?
I've got court in the morning.

396
00:23:30,354 --> 00:23:33,551
Stop saying it like you have a case
every morning.

397
00:23:33,631 --> 00:23:35,469
This is your first one.

398
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:36,429
Well, how...

399
00:23:41,146 --> 00:23:42,025
What are you doing?

400
00:23:42,105 --> 00:23:43,943
Seeing if these windows
are closed.

401
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:45,862
Why is it windy
in here?

402
00:23:45,942 --> 00:23:47,780
I don't feel a draft.

403
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,220
I said wind.

404
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,617
There's a brisk northeasterly wind
blowing in here.

405
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:53,057
Don't get sarcastic.

406
00:23:53,137 --> 00:23:55,454
I'm not getting sarcastic.
I'm getting chapped lips.

407
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,374
How can there be wind...

408
00:23:57,453 --> 00:23:58,332
Aha!

409
00:23:58,412 --> 00:23:59,771
How's this
for an answer?

410
00:23:59,851 --> 00:24:01,490
There's a hole
in the skylight.

411
00:24:05,766 --> 00:24:07,166
Paul,
don't get excited.

412
00:24:07,206 --> 00:24:09,085
We'll plug it up
for tonight.

413
00:24:09,124 --> 00:24:11,003
How?
That's 20 feet high.

414
00:24:11,043 --> 00:24:13,880
Fly over in a plane
and drop something in.

415
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,479
It's only one night.
It's not that cold.

416
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,357
You know what it's like
in February at 3 A.M.?

417
00:24:19,436 --> 00:24:21,594
It's ice-cold freezing.

418
00:24:21,674 --> 00:24:23,513
It's not going
to be freezing.

419
00:24:23,593 --> 00:24:26,311
It's going to be cloudy
with a light snow...

420
00:24:31,228 --> 00:24:32,586
What? What? What?

421
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:33,785
Light what?

422
00:24:33,865 --> 00:24:34,825
Snow.

423
00:24:34,905 --> 00:24:36,223
Snow?

424
00:24:36,303 --> 00:24:38,142
It's going to snow
tonight?

425
00:24:38,222 --> 00:24:39,022
Hmm?

426
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,060
In here?

427
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,859
They're wrong as often
as they're right.

428
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:45,257
I'm going to be shoveling snow
in my living room.

429
00:24:45,337 --> 00:24:47,654
First of all,
it's just a little hole.

430
00:24:47,734 --> 00:24:49,893
Secondly,
what do you want me to do?

431
00:24:49,973 --> 00:24:51,332
Go to pieces...

432
00:24:51,411 --> 00:24:52,571
like me.

433
00:24:52,611 --> 00:24:53,530
It's natural.

434
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:54,489
Paul...

435
00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:57,927
I have a better idea.

436
00:25:02,603 --> 00:25:04,922
I'm going to keep you warm.

437
00:25:05,002 --> 00:25:07,320
And there's no charge
for electricity.

438
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:08,279
All right.

439
00:25:13,594 --> 00:25:14,914
I can't do this.

440
00:25:23,947 --> 00:25:26,305
Do you think
Corie would be upset

441
00:25:26,345 --> 00:25:28,703
if I just popped up
and said hello?

442
00:25:28,743 --> 00:25:30,622
Upset with
her own mother?

443
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:33,020
Why? I do it
all the time.

444
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,939
They're still practically
on their honeymoon.

445
00:25:34,979 --> 00:25:38,056
She's probably dying
for your advice.

446
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:40,454
Not Corie.
She gives her own advice.

447
00:25:40,534 --> 00:25:42,373
All right,
let's go home.

448
00:25:42,453 --> 00:25:44,291
I'll just be 10 minutes.

449
00:25:44,371 --> 00:25:47,010
No longer. I'll be circling
the block.

450
00:25:56,362 --> 00:26:00,599
I see I haven't got
much of a law career ahead of me.

451
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:02,517
Good.
I hope we starve.

452
00:26:02,597 --> 00:26:05,395
I hope they find us dead
in each other's arms.

453
00:26:05,475 --> 00:26:08,273
"Frozen skinny lovers
found on 10th Street. "

454
00:26:13,988 --> 00:26:15,827
Then we are in love again?

455
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,745
Yes,
we're in love again.

456
00:26:21,742 --> 00:26:23,262
It's the bed.

457
00:26:23,341 --> 00:26:25,539
It's the bed.

458
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:26,499
Yes.

459
00:26:30,536 --> 00:26:32,255
I hope it's the bed.

460
00:26:33,573 --> 00:26:35,013
Bloomingdale's?

461
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,490
Surprise!

462
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,450
Oh, no.

463
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,409
Your mother?

464
00:26:39,489 --> 00:26:41,327
I invited her
for Tuesday.

465
00:26:41,407 --> 00:26:43,846
I can't entertain her.
I've got court in the morning.

466
00:26:49,801 --> 00:26:52,159
She's going to think
we're Gypsies

467
00:26:52,199 --> 00:26:54,078
living in an empty store.

468
00:26:54,118 --> 00:26:56,956
Five minutes ago,
this place was paradise.

469
00:26:56,996 --> 00:26:58,395
Suddenly,
it's Cannery Row.

470
00:26:58,435 --> 00:26:59,833
She doesn't
understand, Paul.

471
00:26:59,873 --> 00:27:02,712
She has a different
set of values.

472
00:27:02,752 --> 00:27:04,630
She's practical,
not young like us.

473
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:06,429
I'm 26
and cold as hell.

474
00:27:16,381 --> 00:27:18,939
Sorry.

475
00:27:23,935 --> 00:27:24,815
What?

476
00:27:24,895 --> 00:27:26,253
Promise me one thing.

477
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:28,172
Don't tell her
about the rent.

478
00:27:28,252 --> 00:27:30,570
If she asks you,
tell her you're not sure.

479
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,929
I have to know
what my rent is.

480
00:27:32,969 --> 00:27:34,367
I'm a college graduate.

481
00:27:34,407 --> 00:27:36,286
Can't you lie for me?

482
00:27:36,326 --> 00:27:38,684
You don't have
to tell her it's 125.

483
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:40,603
How much is it,
then?

484
00:27:40,643 --> 00:27:41,561
60.

485
00:27:41,601 --> 00:27:42,521
65.

486
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:43,960
75, all right?

487
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,838
$75.63 a month, including gas
and electricity.

488
00:27:46,878 --> 00:27:48,756
Paul, will she
believe that?

489
00:27:48,796 --> 00:27:50,195
Anybody
would believe that.

490
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:53,073
It's the 125
that's hard to swallow.

491
00:27:57,589 --> 00:27:58,509
Yes? Hello.

492
00:27:58,549 --> 00:28:00,867
Yes, it is.

493
00:28:02,066 --> 00:28:03,584
You what?

494
00:28:03,664 --> 00:28:05,543
Thank you very much
for calling.

495
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,461
Furniture's not coming
till tomorrow.

496
00:28:07,501 --> 00:28:09,380
They're sending up
a mattress

497
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,298
and some blankets
for tonight.

498
00:28:11,338 --> 00:28:12,738
Won't that be cozy?

499
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:14,177
It'll be all right.

500
00:28:14,217 --> 00:28:17,055
Don't let her stay here too long
because I've got...

501
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:20,412
A case in court in the morning.
I know.

502
00:28:20,452 --> 00:28:21,377
Hello, Mother.

503
00:28:21,417 --> 00:28:22,343
Hello, Mom.

504
00:28:22,383 --> 00:28:23,791
I can't breathe.

505
00:28:23,831 --> 00:28:25,240
Take it easy,
Mother.

506
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,171
I can't catch my breath.

507
00:28:27,211 --> 00:28:28,619
You should
have rested.

508
00:28:28,659 --> 00:28:31,033
I did, but there were always
more stairs.

509
00:28:31,073 --> 00:28:32,481
Paul, help her.

510
00:28:32,521 --> 00:28:33,929
Watch this step.

511
00:28:33,969 --> 00:28:34,895
More stairs?

512
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:39,240
Mother, would you like
a glass of water?

513
00:28:39,281 --> 00:28:42,136
No, thank you, dear.
I can't swallow yet.

514
00:28:42,177 --> 00:28:44,067
Oh, my.

515
00:28:44,108 --> 00:28:45,998
It's not that high,
Mother.

516
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:47,446
It's not bad, really.

517
00:28:47,487 --> 00:28:49,379
What is it,
nine flights?

518
00:28:49,419 --> 00:28:52,275
It's five. We don't count
the front stoop.

519
00:28:52,315 --> 00:28:56,137
If I had known the people
on the third floor,

520
00:28:56,177 --> 00:28:58,148
I'd have gone
to visit them.

521
00:28:59,477 --> 00:29:02,292
Oh, gee, Mother,
what a pleasant surprise.

522
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:03,740
I'm not staying.

523
00:29:03,821 --> 00:29:06,718
Aunt Harriet's honking the horn for me
in 10 minutes.

524
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:08,689
Just one good look
around.

525
00:29:08,729 --> 00:29:11,103
I'm not sure
I'm coming back.

526
00:29:11,143 --> 00:29:13,034
You can't
tell anything yet.

527
00:29:13,074 --> 00:29:16,413
I wish you'd arrived
after the furniture had come.

528
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:18,264
I have a marvelous
imagination.

529
00:29:23,293 --> 00:29:24,298
Hmm.

530
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:26,954
Well?

531
00:29:27,035 --> 00:29:30,373
Corie, baby,
it's beautiful.

532
00:29:30,454 --> 00:29:31,621
You hate it.

533
00:29:31,701 --> 00:29:35,000
No, no, I love it.
It's a charming apartment.

534
00:29:35,081 --> 00:29:36,851
I love it.

535
00:29:36,931 --> 00:29:39,587
I knew you wouldn't
like it.

536
00:29:39,667 --> 00:29:41,035
I love it.

537
00:29:41,115 --> 00:29:42,966
Paul,
didn't I say that?

538
00:29:43,046 --> 00:29:44,897
She said
she loved it.

539
00:29:44,978 --> 00:29:46,828
I knew
I said it.

540
00:29:46,909 --> 00:29:49,725
Are you absolutely
crazy in love with it?

541
00:29:49,805 --> 00:29:51,173
Yes. It's very cute.

542
00:29:51,254 --> 00:29:53,587
There's so much
you can do with it.

543
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:55,518
I told you
she'd hate it.

544
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:57,931
Corie, you don't give
a person a chance.

545
00:29:58,012 --> 00:29:59,862
Let me see
the whole apartment.

546
00:29:59,943 --> 00:30:01,311
This is it.

547
00:30:01,392 --> 00:30:03,243
It's a nice large room.

548
00:30:03,323 --> 00:30:04,691
There's a bedroom.

549
00:30:04,771 --> 00:30:06,139
One flight up.

550
00:30:06,219 --> 00:30:08,553
It's just two steps.
See, 1, 2... 3.

551
00:30:08,633 --> 00:30:10,524
Oh, split level.

552
00:30:10,604 --> 00:30:13,824
Where's the bedroom?
Through here?

553
00:30:13,904 --> 00:30:16,237
No, in here.
This is the bedroom.

554
00:30:16,317 --> 00:30:18,168
It's really
just a dressing room,

555
00:30:18,248 --> 00:30:21,065
but I'm going to use it
as a bedroom.

556
00:30:21,145 --> 00:30:23,479
You can just
put a bed in here.

557
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:24,444
That's right.

558
00:30:24,524 --> 00:30:25,329
How?

559
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:27,743
It'll fit.
I measured the room.

560
00:30:27,824 --> 00:30:29,191
A double bed?

561
00:30:29,272 --> 00:30:30,640
No, a large single.

562
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,606
Very nice.

563
00:30:31,686 --> 00:30:33,054
Where will
Paul sleep?

564
00:30:33,134 --> 00:30:34,020
With me.

565
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:35,065
Large single?

566
00:30:35,146 --> 00:30:37,962
But you won't be able
to get to the closet.

567
00:30:38,043 --> 00:30:39,410
Yes, you will.

568
00:30:39,491 --> 00:30:41,341
Without climbing
over the bed?

569
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:44,237
You have to climb
over the bed.

570
00:30:44,318 --> 00:30:45,686
That's a good idea.

571
00:30:45,767 --> 00:30:48,582
You can just hang your clothes
from the pipe.

572
00:30:48,663 --> 00:30:49,589
That's right.

573
00:30:50,876 --> 00:30:52,767
Everything
is just temporary.

574
00:30:52,847 --> 00:30:55,664
What do they say
in Harper's Bazaar?

575
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,112
It won't take shape

576
00:30:57,152 --> 00:31:00,009
until the bride's own
personality becomes clearly defined.

577
00:31:00,049 --> 00:31:02,422
I think it's you
right now.

578
00:31:02,502 --> 00:31:04,193
What's in here?

579
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,336
Oh... the bathroom.

580
00:31:10,067 --> 00:31:11,193
No bathtub.

581
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:13,768
This is the kitchen.

582
00:31:13,848 --> 00:31:16,462
It's very cozy.

583
00:31:16,503 --> 00:31:17,912
It's chilly in here.

584
00:31:17,952 --> 00:31:19,360
You feel a draft?

585
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,291
Stand over here.
It's warmer.

586
00:31:21,331 --> 00:31:23,624
What you need
is a drink.

587
00:31:23,705 --> 00:31:26,762
Would you run down
and get some Scotch?

588
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,693
You have
lots of wall space.

589
00:31:28,733 --> 00:31:30,745
What color are you
going to paint it?

590
00:31:30,785 --> 00:31:32,274
It's painted.

591
00:31:32,355 --> 00:31:34,969
Very attractive.

592
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,430
I've got to go.

593
00:31:38,509 --> 00:31:40,843
No, Mother. Not till you
have a drink.

594
00:31:40,923 --> 00:31:43,257
Aren't you going
to get the Scotch?

595
00:31:43,337 --> 00:31:45,188
I'll stay for
just one drink.

596
00:31:45,268 --> 00:31:46,636
Button up. It's cold.

597
00:31:46,716 --> 00:31:47,602
I've noticed.

598
00:31:47,682 --> 00:31:49,050
Get some cheese.

599
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:50,016
Paul!

600
00:31:50,096 --> 00:31:52,912
I just want to give
my fella a kiss

601
00:31:52,992 --> 00:31:54,361
and wish him luck.

602
00:31:54,442 --> 00:31:56,292
Your new home
is beautiful.

603
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:58,223
It's a perfect
little apartment.

604
00:31:58,304 --> 00:32:00,154
And you do like it?

605
00:32:00,235 --> 00:32:03,050
Where else can you get
anything like this

606
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:04,499
for 75.63 a month?

607
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,947
Are you sure,
Paul?

608
00:32:06,028 --> 00:32:08,200
Six flights
of stairs again.

609
00:32:08,281 --> 00:32:10,694
It's the only way
to travel.

610
00:32:13,752 --> 00:32:14,677
Well...

611
00:32:14,757 --> 00:32:18,419
Corie, baby,
I'm so excited for you.

612
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,637
Mother,
it's not exactly

613
00:32:21,718 --> 00:32:23,568
what you pictured,
is it?

614
00:32:23,649 --> 00:32:25,620
Well, it's unusual...

615
00:32:25,701 --> 00:32:26,626
like you.

616
00:32:26,707 --> 00:32:29,522
I remember when you were
a little girl.

617
00:32:29,563 --> 00:32:32,420
You said you wanted
to live on the moon.

618
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,190
I thought
you were joking.

619
00:32:39,942 --> 00:32:43,080
Well, drunk again, huh?

620
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:45,051
O.K., I'll take care
of him.

621
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,431
I know what let's do.

622
00:32:55,471 --> 00:32:58,328
Let's open my presents
and see what you sent me.

623
00:33:02,512 --> 00:33:05,851
Hey, what's in here?
That sounds expensive.

624
00:33:05,932 --> 00:33:08,467
Now I think
it's a broken clock.

625
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,496
Aunt Harriet
helped me pick it out.

626
00:33:20,576 --> 00:33:24,358
She thinks I should move
into New York City now.

627
00:33:24,438 --> 00:33:25,806
That's an idea.

628
00:33:25,846 --> 00:33:28,220
"Why, Harriet? Just because
I'm alone?" I said.

629
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,151
"I'm not afraid
to live alone.

630
00:33:30,231 --> 00:33:33,048
In some ways, it's better
to live alone,"

631
00:33:33,127 --> 00:33:34,013
I said.

632
00:33:35,059 --> 00:33:36,910
Does this pot
come with directions?

633
00:33:36,991 --> 00:33:39,323
If I had known
about this kitchen,

634
00:33:39,363 --> 00:33:41,737
it would have come
with hot coffee.

635
00:33:41,818 --> 00:33:47,490
Mother,
I love everything.

636
00:33:47,571 --> 00:33:50,387
You've got to stop
sending me presents.

637
00:33:50,468 --> 00:33:53,283
You should start
spending your money on yourself.

638
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,410
Myself?

639
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:58,272
What does a woman like me need
living all alone

640
00:33:58,353 --> 00:34:00,203
way out
in New Jersey?

641
00:34:00,284 --> 00:34:01,651
You could travel.

642
00:34:01,732 --> 00:34:02,698
Travel.

643
00:34:02,778 --> 00:34:06,359
Alone? At my age?

644
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:09,256
I read a story
in the Times.

645
00:34:09,296 --> 00:34:11,348
Middle-aged woman
traveling alone

646
00:34:11,387 --> 00:34:13,239
fell off the deck
of a ship.

647
00:34:13,319 --> 00:34:17,383
They never discovered it
till they got to France.

648
00:34:19,273 --> 00:34:20,721
Mother...

649
00:34:20,802 --> 00:34:23,618
If you ever fell off
the deck of a ship,

650
00:34:23,698 --> 00:34:25,549
somebody would know
about it.

651
00:34:25,629 --> 00:34:28,083
Know what I think
you really need?

652
00:34:28,164 --> 00:34:30,055
I don't want to hear it.

653
00:34:30,095 --> 00:34:31,986
You're afraid
to hear the truth.

654
00:34:32,026 --> 00:34:34,601
It's not the truth
I'm afraid to hear.

655
00:34:34,682 --> 00:34:37,015
It's the word
you're going to use.

656
00:34:37,096 --> 00:34:39,911
Love. Last week I didn't know
what it meant.

657
00:34:39,992 --> 00:34:42,325
Then I checked in
to the Plaza Hotel.

658
00:34:42,406 --> 00:34:43,854
Know what happened there?

659
00:34:43,934 --> 00:34:45,745
I promised myself
I wouldn't ask.

660
00:34:45,825 --> 00:34:47,194
I fell in love.

661
00:34:47,274 --> 00:34:49,125
Spiritual, physical,
and emotional love.

662
00:34:49,205 --> 00:34:51,297
No one should be
without it.

663
00:34:51,378 --> 00:34:52,745
I have you.

664
00:34:52,826 --> 00:34:54,676
I'm not talking
about that kind...

665
00:34:54,757 --> 00:34:56,607
I know what you're
talking about.

666
00:34:56,688 --> 00:34:58,538
You don't want
to discuss it?

667
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:00,107
Not with you
present.

668
00:35:02,481 --> 00:35:04,815
That must be
Aunt Harriet.

669
00:35:06,907 --> 00:35:08,274
I've got to go.

670
00:35:08,355 --> 00:35:09,482
Some visit.

671
00:35:09,522 --> 00:35:10,930
Just a sneak preview.

672
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:13,344
I'll see you Tuesday
for the world premiere.

673
00:35:13,384 --> 00:35:16,159
You shouldn't have run
just for me.

674
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,125
Goodbye, love.

675
00:35:17,206 --> 00:35:19,057
I love
your new apartment.

676
00:35:19,137 --> 00:35:22,154
I'll see you both
on Tuesday.

677
00:35:23,884 --> 00:35:25,252
Geronimo.

678
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,931
Paul, what's the matter?

679
00:35:41,063 --> 00:35:43,437
I just had
an interesting talk

680
00:35:43,477 --> 00:35:45,851
with the man
in the liquor store.

681
00:35:45,891 --> 00:35:48,747
We have some of the greatest weirdos
in the country

682
00:35:48,787 --> 00:35:50,195
living
in this building.

683
00:35:50,235 --> 00:35:51,161
Like who?

684
00:35:51,201 --> 00:35:53,092
In Apartment 1C
are the Boscos,

685
00:35:53,132 --> 00:35:54,540
Mr. And Mrs.
J. Bosco.

686
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,988
Who are they?

687
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:58,402
A lovely young couple
of the same sex.

688
00:35:58,442 --> 00:36:00,816
No one knows
which one that is.

689
00:36:00,856 --> 00:36:03,230
In 3C are
Mr. And Mrs. Gonzales...

690
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:05,644
Mr. And Mrs. Armandariz,
and Mr. Calhoun,

691
00:36:05,685 --> 00:36:07,575
who must be
the umpire.

692
00:36:07,616 --> 00:36:09,506
Guess who lives in 4D.

693
00:36:09,547 --> 00:36:10,954
I don't know.

694
00:36:10,995 --> 00:36:12,322
Nobody else does either.

695
00:36:12,402 --> 00:36:14,253
Nobody's been seen
in three years,

696
00:36:14,334 --> 00:36:17,029
except every morning
there are nine empty tuna cans

697
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,477
outside the door.

698
00:36:18,558 --> 00:36:21,374
Sounds like a big cat
with a can opener.

699
00:36:21,455 --> 00:36:23,789
Victor Velasco
lives in 6A, the attic.

700
00:36:23,829 --> 00:36:26,202
He's 58. He skis,
he climbs mountains,

701
00:36:26,282 --> 00:36:28,134
he's been married
four times.

702
00:36:28,213 --> 00:36:30,426
He's known as the Bluebeard
of 10th Street.

703
00:36:30,466 --> 00:36:31,674
What does that mean?

704
00:36:31,754 --> 00:36:35,536
Either he attacks girls
or he's got a blue beard.

705
00:36:35,616 --> 00:36:36,742
Where are you going?

706
00:36:36,823 --> 00:36:39,156
To stand in the bedroom
and work.

707
00:36:39,237 --> 00:36:42,295
If the bed or the heat
comes up, let me know.

708
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:06,567
Paul...

709
00:37:06,648 --> 00:37:07,534
Hmm?

710
00:37:07,614 --> 00:37:08,903
Are you asleep?

711
00:37:08,984 --> 00:37:12,206
Just my hands
and my feet.

712
00:37:15,307 --> 00:37:17,160
Know what the trouble is?

713
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,093
We're wearing
too much clothing.

714
00:37:19,173 --> 00:37:21,509
Know how the Eskimos
keep warm?

715
00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:23,442
They check into a motel.

716
00:37:30,087 --> 00:37:31,940
Paul, do you hate me?

717
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:32,907
Yes.

718
00:37:32,987 --> 00:37:33,873
Say it.

719
00:37:33,953 --> 00:37:35,846
I hate you.

720
00:37:35,927 --> 00:37:38,263
I hate you.

721
00:37:41,405 --> 00:37:43,257
There's somebody
at the door.

722
00:37:43,338 --> 00:37:45,674
If it's the Red Cross,
let them in.

723
00:37:45,754 --> 00:37:47,607
Aren't you
going to answer it?

724
00:37:47,687 --> 00:37:50,024
You found the apartment.
You answer it.

725
00:38:04,643 --> 00:38:05,811
Paul.

726
00:38:12,093 --> 00:38:14,189
Who are you?

727
00:38:14,269 --> 00:38:15,316
Who are you?

728
00:38:15,396 --> 00:38:16,283
I live here.

729
00:38:16,363 --> 00:38:17,289
So do I.

730
00:38:17,369 --> 00:38:18,860
How delightful.

731
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,277
I hope I didn't
disturb you.

732
00:38:21,357 --> 00:38:23,653
My name is Velasco,
Victor Velasco.

733
00:38:23,693 --> 00:38:25,948
The Bluebeard...
from the attic?

734
00:38:26,028 --> 00:38:30,016
I was wondering
if I could use your bedroom.

735
00:38:30,097 --> 00:38:31,466
The bedroom? No.

736
00:38:31,547 --> 00:38:33,399
I can't get
into my apartment.

737
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,299
I wanted to crawl out your window
along the ledge.

738
00:38:36,379 --> 00:38:38,232
Did you
lose your key?

739
00:38:38,313 --> 00:38:41,615
I have my key, but it no longer
fits the lock.

740
00:38:41,695 --> 00:38:44,475
The penalty of being
four months behind on the rent.

741
00:38:47,214 --> 00:38:49,831
So, you say
you live here?

742
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:51,965
Just moved in today.

743
00:38:52,046 --> 00:38:55,348
Really? And what are you,
a folk singer?

744
00:38:55,429 --> 00:38:57,725
No, a wife.

745
00:38:57,806 --> 00:39:00,624
You know, of course,
you're very pretty.

746
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:04,210
All indications point
to my falling in love with you.

747
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:10,569
I see our ratfink landlord has left
a hole in the skylight.

748
00:39:10,649 --> 00:39:13,443
He's going to fix it,
won't he?

749
00:39:13,523 --> 00:39:15,358
I wouldn't
count on it.

750
00:39:15,438 --> 00:39:18,232
My bathtub has been leaking
since 1949.

751
00:39:18,312 --> 00:39:21,584
Tell me... does your husband, uh,
work during the day?

752
00:39:21,664 --> 00:39:22,541
Yes.

753
00:39:22,621 --> 00:39:23,978
In an office?

754
00:39:24,058 --> 00:39:24,936
Yes.

755
00:39:25,016 --> 00:39:27,809
Good. I work at home
during the day.

756
00:39:27,889 --> 00:39:29,246
I predict interesting
complications.

757
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,161
Am I making you
nervous?

758
00:39:31,241 --> 00:39:32,119
Very nervous.

759
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:33,076
Ha! Wonderful.

760
00:39:33,156 --> 00:39:34,513
Once a month

761
00:39:34,593 --> 00:39:37,387
I try to make
pretty young girls nervous

762
00:39:37,467 --> 00:39:40,260
just to keep my ego
from going out.

763
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:43,133
I'll save you
a lot of anguish.

764
00:39:43,213 --> 00:39:45,528
I'm 6...
I'm 58 years old

765
00:39:45,608 --> 00:39:47,284
and a thoroughly
nice fellow.

766
00:39:47,364 --> 00:39:49,359
Well, I'm glad
to hear that.

767
00:39:49,439 --> 00:39:52,032
I wish I were
10 years older.

768
00:39:52,112 --> 00:39:53,509
Older?

769
00:39:53,588 --> 00:39:57,819
Dirty old men seem to get away
with a lot more.

770
00:39:57,899 --> 00:39:59,735
I'm still
at the awkward age.

771
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,969
When do I get
invited down for dinner?

772
00:40:02,049 --> 00:40:04,364
Dinner? We'd love to have you
for dinner

773
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:07,276
as soon as we
get set up.

774
00:40:07,356 --> 00:40:09,711
With newlyweds,
I could starve to death.

775
00:40:09,751 --> 00:40:11,707
Shall we say
next Tuesday night?

776
00:40:11,786 --> 00:40:14,101
Tuesday night?
No, my mother's...

777
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,537
Tuesday night's
fine.

778
00:40:15,617 --> 00:40:17,213
It's a date.

779
00:40:17,253 --> 00:40:18,650
I'll bring the wine.

780
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:21,044
You can pay me
when I get here.

781
00:40:21,084 --> 00:40:23,918
You're invited to my cocktail party
tomorrow night, 10:00.

782
00:40:23,958 --> 00:40:25,235
You do drink, don't you?

783
00:40:25,315 --> 00:40:26,272
Yes, of course.

784
00:40:26,312 --> 00:40:28,308
Good. Bring liquor.
Until tomorrow.

785
00:40:28,388 --> 00:40:30,223
If we don't
freeze first.

786
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:33,096
You don't know
about the plumbing, do you?

787
00:40:33,176 --> 00:40:35,491
Everything in this museum
works backwards.

788
00:40:35,571 --> 00:40:38,843
For example, on the steam,
it says turn right,

789
00:40:38,923 --> 00:40:40,280
so you turn left.

790
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,195
Except I can't reach it.

791
00:40:42,275 --> 00:40:44,589
Will you help me up,
please?

792
00:40:44,669 --> 00:40:46,983
With the greatest
of physical pleasure.

793
00:40:47,064 --> 00:40:48,660
1, 2, 3, up.

794
00:40:52,372 --> 00:40:54,766
Corie, was there anyone...

795
00:40:56,522 --> 00:40:58,836
We were just warming up
the apartment.

796
00:41:00,512 --> 00:41:02,387
Uh, Paul...

797
00:41:02,427 --> 00:41:03,346
Whoo!

798
00:41:03,385 --> 00:41:05,740
This is Mr. Velasco
from upstairs.

799
00:41:05,779 --> 00:41:07,656
He was just telling me

800
00:41:07,696 --> 00:41:09,571
that all our plumbing
works backwards.

801
00:41:09,611 --> 00:41:10,768
That's right.

802
00:41:10,848 --> 00:41:12,683
An important thing
to remember is

803
00:41:12,763 --> 00:41:15,557
you have to flush up.
Until tomorrow night.

804
00:41:15,637 --> 00:41:17,472
What's tomorrow night?
Where's he going?

805
00:41:17,552 --> 00:41:18,909
Don't forget Tuesday.

806
00:41:18,989 --> 00:41:21,543
What's he doing
in the bedroom?

807
00:41:41,695 --> 00:41:44,848
That nut went out
the window.

808
00:41:51,034 --> 00:41:51,912
Hello.

809
00:41:51,991 --> 00:41:53,348
Hello, Mother?
It's me.

810
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:55,743
Did you hear
what I said?

811
00:41:55,823 --> 00:41:56,900
Nothing's wrong.

812
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:00,571
I just want to confirm
our Tuesday night dinner date.

813
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:02,528
At 2:00
in the morning?

814
00:42:02,567 --> 00:42:04,244
I want to be sure
you'll come.

815
00:42:04,323 --> 00:42:06,039
At 2:00
in the morning?

816
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,912
And, Mother, wear something
gay and frivolous.

817
00:42:08,952 --> 00:42:11,387
Buy a new dress.

818
00:42:11,466 --> 00:42:13,502
At 2:00
in the morning?

819
00:42:13,581 --> 00:42:15,975
I'll call you
tomorrow. Bye.

820
00:42:17,253 --> 00:42:18,649
Who you waving at?

821
00:42:18,689 --> 00:42:20,485
Him.

822
00:42:52,491 --> 00:42:54,765
I decided to meet you here
every day.

823
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:57,639
It takes you so long
to climb the stairs,

824
00:42:57,678 --> 00:42:59,554
and I can't wait for you.

825
00:42:59,594 --> 00:43:01,948
The bus driver will think
you're my mother.

826
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:11,765
Have you
an Aunt Fern?

827
00:43:11,845 --> 00:43:14,159
She sent us
a check today.

828
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:17,033
Boy, do you have
a cheap Aunt Fern.

829
00:43:17,113 --> 00:43:18,948
I'll write
and tell her.

830
00:43:19,028 --> 00:43:20,864
Your mother called
from Philly.

831
00:43:20,943 --> 00:43:23,737
She and your father
are coming up,

832
00:43:23,817 --> 00:43:27,089
and your sister has
a new boyfriend from Rutgers.

833
00:43:27,169 --> 00:43:29,963
He has acne, and
they all hate him,

834
00:43:30,043 --> 00:43:31,399
including
your sister.

835
00:43:31,479 --> 00:43:33,314
Did you miss me
today?

836
00:43:33,395 --> 00:43:34,272
No.

837
00:43:34,352 --> 00:43:35,231
Why not?

838
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:36,666
You called eight times.

839
00:43:36,746 --> 00:43:39,540
I don't talk to you
that much when I'm home.

840
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:42,414
Grouch. How'd it go
in court today?

841
00:43:42,493 --> 00:43:43,850
Gump or Birnbaum?

842
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:44,808
Birnbaum.

843
00:43:44,887 --> 00:43:46,244
You won? Oh, Paul!

844
00:43:46,324 --> 00:43:47,721
Oh, I'm so proud.

845
00:43:49,238 --> 00:43:50,515
Aren't you happy?

846
00:43:50,595 --> 00:43:52,430
We were awarded
6 cents.

847
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:54,824
You have to be
awarded something,

848
00:43:54,904 --> 00:43:57,698
so the court made it
6 cents.

849
00:43:57,778 --> 00:43:59,613
How much do you get?

850
00:43:59,693 --> 00:44:01,529
Birnbaum gets
the whole 6 cents.

851
00:44:01,609 --> 00:44:02,966
From here on in,

852
00:44:03,045 --> 00:44:06,796
I get the cases that come in
for a dime or under.

853
00:44:10,388 --> 00:44:11,745
Grouch,
grouch, grouch.

854
00:44:11,825 --> 00:44:14,618
You weren't that grouchy
under the covers.

855
00:44:14,698 --> 00:44:18,928
Do you have to carry on a personal
conversation with me on the stairs?

856
00:44:19,008 --> 00:44:20,365
What's wrong with it?

857
00:44:20,444 --> 00:44:22,759
Everybody knows
the intimate details of your life.

858
00:44:22,838 --> 00:44:25,632
I ring the bell, and suddenly
we're on the air.

859
00:44:25,712 --> 00:44:28,026
I better make you
a drink.

860
00:44:28,106 --> 00:44:30,421
You're supposed to be
charming tonight.

861
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,294
This little dinner
you have planned for tonight

862
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:36,168
has got fiasco
written all over it.

863
00:44:36,247 --> 00:44:39,041
Maybe they have
a lot in common.

864
00:44:39,121 --> 00:44:40,478
Are you kidding?

865
00:44:40,558 --> 00:44:41,595
Your mother?

866
00:44:41,674 --> 00:44:44,468
That quiet, dainty
little woman from New Jersey

867
00:44:44,548 --> 00:44:46,862
and the Count
of Monte Cristo?

868
00:44:46,942 --> 00:44:47,820
You must be kidding.

869
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:48,738
Why?

870
00:44:48,779 --> 00:44:50,175
You've seen
his apartment.

871
00:44:50,214 --> 00:44:52,570
He wears Japanese kimonos
and sleeps on rugs.

872
00:44:52,609 --> 00:44:55,402
Your mother wears a hair net
and sleeps on a board.

873
00:44:55,482 --> 00:44:56,919
Boof.

874
00:45:05,978 --> 00:45:07,814
Maybe we could help her.

875
00:45:07,894 --> 00:45:09,729
We don't have
to introduce her

876
00:45:09,809 --> 00:45:12,123
as my dull, 52-year-old,
housewife mother.

877
00:45:12,203 --> 00:45:14,518
That wasn't the exact wording
I had planned.

878
00:45:14,598 --> 00:45:16,434
What did you have
in mind?

879
00:45:16,514 --> 00:45:17,870
Something more glamorous.

880
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:19,107
Former actress.

881
00:45:20,145 --> 00:45:22,459
You know, of course,
that she was in

882
00:45:22,539 --> 00:45:24,375
The Man
Who Came To Dinner.

883
00:45:24,454 --> 00:45:26,770
Your mother? Where?
The East Orange Women's Club?

884
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:29,164
On Broadway. She was in
the original company

885
00:45:29,243 --> 00:45:30,680
of Strange Interlude,

886
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,074
and she had
a small singing part

887
00:45:33,114 --> 00:45:34,511
in Knickerbocker Holiday.

888
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,948
Are you serious?

889
00:45:35,988 --> 00:45:38,382
Cross my heart.

890
00:45:40,458 --> 00:45:41,814
Your mother an actress?

891
00:45:41,893 --> 00:45:42,812
Yeah.

892
00:45:44,328 --> 00:45:46,124
You never told me this.

893
00:45:46,204 --> 00:45:48,518
Why didn't you
ever tell me?

894
00:45:48,598 --> 00:45:50,913
I didn't think
you'd be interested.

895
00:45:50,993 --> 00:45:52,350
That's fascinating.

896
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:54,584
I can't get over that.

897
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,777
See?
Now you're interested.

898
00:45:57,857 --> 00:45:59,214
It's a lie.

899
00:45:59,294 --> 00:46:00,650
Every bit of it.

900
00:46:00,729 --> 00:46:02,606
I'm going to control
myself.

901
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,670
Hello, Mom.

902
00:46:26,749 --> 00:46:27,946
Are you
all right?

903
00:46:28,026 --> 00:46:28,904
Paul...

904
00:46:28,984 --> 00:46:29,861
Yes, Mom.

905
00:46:29,942 --> 00:46:32,256
In my handbag...
are some pink pills.

906
00:46:32,336 --> 00:46:33,533
Pink pills? Right.

907
00:46:33,613 --> 00:46:36,406
I'll be all right.
I'm a little out of breath.

908
00:46:36,486 --> 00:46:38,321
I'll get you
something to drink.

909
00:46:38,401 --> 00:46:40,716
I had to park
three blocks away.

910
00:46:40,796 --> 00:46:43,509
It started to rain, so I ran
the last two blocks.

911
00:46:43,589 --> 00:46:46,064
Then my heel got caught in
the subway grating.

912
00:46:46,144 --> 00:46:48,937
When I pulled my foot out,
I stepped in a puddle.

913
00:46:49,017 --> 00:46:51,491
Then a cab went by and
splashed my stockings.

914
00:46:51,571 --> 00:46:53,885
If the hardware
store downstairs was open,

915
00:46:53,966 --> 00:46:56,759
I was going to buy a knife
and kill myself.

916
00:46:56,838 --> 00:46:57,717
Drink this.

917
00:46:57,797 --> 00:46:59,154
Here's your pill,
Mom.

918
00:47:03,383 --> 00:47:05,697
A martini
to wash down a pill.

919
00:47:05,777 --> 00:47:07,294
It'll make you
feel better.

920
00:47:07,374 --> 00:47:09,848
A martini I had at
home made me sick.

921
00:47:09,928 --> 00:47:11,445
That's what
the pill's for.

922
00:47:11,524 --> 00:47:13,041
Let me help you
inside.

923
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:15,595
You need food. I'll get you
an hors d'oeuvre.

924
00:47:15,674 --> 00:47:16,553
No, thanks.

925
00:47:16,632 --> 00:47:18,947
It's just sour cream
and blue cheese.

926
00:47:19,026 --> 00:47:20,862
I wish you hadn't
said that.

927
00:47:20,942 --> 00:47:22,139
Like to lie down?

928
00:47:22,219 --> 00:47:25,173
No, thanks, dear.
I can't lie down without my board.

929
00:47:25,252 --> 00:47:29,003
Right now, all I want to do is
see the apartment.

930
00:47:29,083 --> 00:47:30,919
Well, then...
help you up.

931
00:47:30,998 --> 00:47:32,036
Up.

932
00:47:37,384 --> 00:47:38,341
Corie.

933
00:47:39,499 --> 00:47:40,377
Corie!

934
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:41,653
Do you like it?

935
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:42,891
Like it?

936
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:43,849
Tsk.

937
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:47,799
It's magnificent.

938
00:47:49,436 --> 00:47:50,353
Oh...

939
00:47:51,351 --> 00:47:54,464
Oh. And you did it all
by yourself.

940
00:47:54,544 --> 00:47:56,379
Mr. Velasco gave me
some ideas.

941
00:47:56,459 --> 00:47:57,657
- Who?
- Our decorator.

942
00:47:57,736 --> 00:48:00,290
He comes in through the window
once a week.

943
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:02,405
Oh, the man
that lives upstairs.

944
00:48:02,485 --> 00:48:04,800
Oh, you've heard
about him, eh?

945
00:48:04,879 --> 00:48:07,673
Yes. Corie had me on the phone for
two hours yesterday.

946
00:48:07,753 --> 00:48:10,067
Did you know he's been married
four times?

947
00:48:10,147 --> 00:48:12,941
Yes. If I were you,
I'd sleep with a gun.

948
00:48:14,896 --> 00:48:15,774
Mother...

949
00:48:15,853 --> 00:48:18,169
See, we did
get the bed in.

950
00:48:18,248 --> 00:48:19,765
Yes. Just fits,
doesn't it?

951
00:48:19,845 --> 00:48:22,159
Just. We have to
turn in unison.

952
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:23,596
Well, I must admit,

953
00:48:23,676 --> 00:48:26,389
I never expected
anything like this.

954
00:48:27,427 --> 00:48:29,103
Can't wait to see
the expression

955
00:48:29,182 --> 00:48:31,018
on your parents'
faces tonight, Paul.

956
00:48:31,098 --> 00:48:32,933
I beg your...
my what?

957
00:48:33,013 --> 00:48:34,211
Your mother
and father.

958
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:35,807
We're dining
with them tonight.

959
00:48:35,887 --> 00:48:37,643
Isn't that what
you said, Corie?

960
00:48:37,722 --> 00:48:39,558
Is that what
you told her?

961
00:48:39,638 --> 00:48:42,432
If I said you had a blind date
with Mr. Velasco,

962
00:48:42,511 --> 00:48:44,985
I couldn't have blasted you
out of the house.

963
00:48:45,065 --> 00:48:46,582
Blind date
with Mr. Velas...

964
00:48:46,661 --> 00:48:48,178
The man that
lives upst...

965
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:49,136
Good God.

966
00:48:49,216 --> 00:48:50,732
What's all the panic,
Mother?

967
00:48:50,812 --> 00:48:52,168
He's just a man.

968
00:48:52,249 --> 00:48:54,085
My accountant
is just a man.

969
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:56,479
You make him sound like
Douglas Fairbanks.

970
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:59,352
He looks nothing
like Douglas Fairbanks, does he, Paul?

971
00:48:59,392 --> 00:49:01,228
No. He just
jumps like him.

972
00:49:01,268 --> 00:49:03,781
Come on. You're going to have
a marvelous evening.

973
00:49:03,821 --> 00:49:05,059
Come on where?

974
00:49:05,098 --> 00:49:06,655
To Mr. Velasco's
for cocktails.

975
00:49:06,695 --> 00:49:07,932
I'm not even dressed.

976
00:49:07,972 --> 00:49:09,208
You look fine.

977
00:49:09,288 --> 00:49:11,763
For Paul's parents
I just wanted to look clean.

978
00:49:11,803 --> 00:49:13,359
He'll think
I'm a nurse.

979
00:49:13,399 --> 00:49:14,956
He'll think you're very
interesting.

980
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:16,233
How's my hair?

981
00:49:16,273 --> 00:49:18,627
Fine. Push it up
a bit in back.

982
00:49:18,667 --> 00:49:21,021
Paul, is something
wrong with my hair?

983
00:49:22,657 --> 00:49:25,012
Mother, just try to go along
with everything.

984
00:49:25,052 --> 00:49:27,406
What do you mean?
Where are we going?

985
00:49:27,446 --> 00:49:29,003
Be one
of the fellows.

986
00:49:29,042 --> 00:49:30,280
One of what fellows?

987
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:31,556
Should I go first?

988
00:49:31,596 --> 00:49:32,514
Go where?

989
00:49:32,554 --> 00:49:34,908
Up there. That's where
the birdman lives.

990
00:49:34,948 --> 00:49:35,906
Good Lord.

991
00:49:36,984 --> 00:49:37,862
Oh...

992
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:40,257
Go on, Paul.
It's all right, Mother.

993
00:49:40,336 --> 00:49:41,973
I'll be right
behind you.

994
00:49:42,132 --> 00:49:42,930
Oh!

995
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:44,606
Mother, are you
all right?

996
00:49:44,686 --> 00:49:47,000
Oh, my! You should've
told me about this.

997
00:49:47,081 --> 00:49:48,596
I'd have gone
into training.

998
00:49:48,676 --> 00:49:50,712
I've got you.
Paul, pull her up.

999
00:49:50,752 --> 00:49:51,988
Give me your hand.

1000
00:49:52,028 --> 00:49:53,266
You're pulling
my arm!

1001
00:49:53,306 --> 00:49:54,543
Stop pulling
her arm!

1002
00:49:54,583 --> 00:49:56,139
I'm not pulling.
I'm helping.

1003
00:49:56,179 --> 00:49:57,096
Ohh!

1004
00:49:58,414 --> 00:49:59,491
Thank you.

1005
00:49:59,571 --> 00:50:02,324
Oh! Isn't this wild?
What do you think, Mother?

1006
00:50:02,404 --> 00:50:03,761
I've broken
some straps.

1007
00:50:03,841 --> 00:50:04,719
Hello?

1008
00:50:06,355 --> 00:50:07,712
Ah, my guests.

1009
00:50:07,792 --> 00:50:08,670
Paul...

1010
00:50:09,867 --> 00:50:11,224
I beg
your pardon?

1011
00:50:11,304 --> 00:50:13,618
I was just saying
hello in Burmese.

1012
00:50:13,698 --> 00:50:14,576
Corie,
ra-vi-shing!

1013
00:50:14,656 --> 00:50:15,853
What does that mean?

1014
00:50:15,932 --> 00:50:17,608
Ravishing.
That's English.

1015
00:50:17,688 --> 00:50:19,045
Ha ha ha ha!

1016
00:50:19,125 --> 00:50:20,961
Paul, would you do
the honors?

1017
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,515
I don't believe you've met Corie's
mother... Mrs. Banks.

1018
00:50:23,595 --> 00:50:25,311
Mom, our new neighbor...
Mr. Velasco.

1019
00:50:25,391 --> 00:50:26,588
How do you do?

1020
00:50:26,668 --> 00:50:29,438
Mrs. Banks, I've been
looking forward so to meeting you.

1021
00:50:29,518 --> 00:50:31,927
I invited your daughter
to my cocktail party,

1022
00:50:32,007 --> 00:50:34,978
and she spent the entire evening
talking of you.

1023
00:50:35,058 --> 00:50:36,946
That must've been
a dull party.

1024
00:50:36,986 --> 00:50:38,230
Not at all.

1025
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:41,441
I meant talking about me
must've been dull, not the party.

1026
00:50:41,482 --> 00:50:42,887
Ha ha. I understand.

1027
00:50:42,927 --> 00:50:43,851
Thank you.

1028
00:50:43,891 --> 00:50:45,295
Won't you sit down?

1029
00:50:56,737 --> 00:50:57,982
Whishhh!

1030
00:50:58,022 --> 00:50:59,428
Aren't these
marvelous?

1031
00:50:59,468 --> 00:51:01,555
Yes, they're
marvelous.

1032
00:51:02,598 --> 00:51:03,482
And now...

1033
00:51:05,489 --> 00:51:06,373
Knichi!

1034
00:51:06,453 --> 00:51:07,336
Knichi?

1035
00:51:07,416 --> 00:51:08,942
It's an
hors d'oeuvre, Mother.

1036
00:51:09,022 --> 00:51:10,548
Mr. Velasco
makes them himself.

1037
00:51:10,628 --> 00:51:12,314
He's a... a
famous gourmet.

1038
00:51:12,395 --> 00:51:13,439
Gourmet.
Imagine.

1039
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:16,008
Didn't you once cook for the
king of Sweden?

1040
00:51:16,088 --> 00:51:18,417
Well, we belong to the same
gourmet society.

1041
00:51:18,497 --> 00:51:19,862
150 charter
members,

1042
00:51:19,943 --> 00:51:21,870
including the king,
Prince Philip,

1043
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:22,873
Fidel Castro.

1044
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,158
Fidel Castro,
too.

1045
00:51:24,198 --> 00:51:26,566
Yes. We meet once
every five years

1046
00:51:26,606 --> 00:51:29,096
for a dinner
we cook ourselves.

1047
00:51:29,176 --> 00:51:32,107
In 1987, they're
supposed to come to my house.

1048
00:51:32,187 --> 00:51:34,235
We have another
30 seconds.

1049
00:51:34,275 --> 00:51:35,198
Till what?

1050
00:51:35,238 --> 00:51:36,643
Until they're
edible.

1051
00:51:36,683 --> 00:51:38,089
The last 15 seconds,

1052
00:51:38,129 --> 00:51:40,497
we just let them
sit there and breathe.

1053
00:51:40,537 --> 00:51:42,545
Oh, Paul,
aren't they gorgeous?

1054
00:51:42,626 --> 00:51:43,749
Yeah.

1055
00:51:43,789 --> 00:51:45,194
When you eat knichi,

1056
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:47,604
you take a bite
into history.

1057
00:51:47,644 --> 00:51:50,012
Knichi is over
2,000 years old.

1058
00:51:50,052 --> 00:51:52,903
Not this particular batch,
of course. Ha ha.

1059
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,670
Ha ha ha ha...

1060
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:56,114
Ha ha ha.

1061
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:59,608
Would you be betraying the society
by telling us what's in them?

1062
00:51:59,648 --> 00:52:01,334
Well, if caught,

1063
00:52:01,414 --> 00:52:03,742
your taste buds
are ostracized for two years.

1064
00:52:03,823 --> 00:52:05,348
But since I'm
among friends...

1065
00:52:05,429 --> 00:52:07,275
It's bits
of salted fish,

1066
00:52:07,356 --> 00:52:08,239
grated olives,

1067
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,363
spices,

1068
00:52:09,443 --> 00:52:10,808
and onion batter.

1069
00:52:12,013 --> 00:52:12,936
Ready?

1070
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,145
5...

1071
00:52:15,225 --> 00:52:16,268
4...

1072
00:52:16,348 --> 00:52:17,232
3...

1073
00:52:17,312 --> 00:52:18,195
2...

1074
00:52:18,275 --> 00:52:20,122
1... 0. Mrs. Banks.

1075
00:52:20,202 --> 00:52:21,607
Oh. Thank you.

1076
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:23,896
What's the fish?

1077
00:52:23,977 --> 00:52:24,859
Eel.

1078
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:26,184
Eel?

1079
00:52:26,265 --> 00:52:27,269
Eel.

1080
00:52:27,349 --> 00:52:29,637
That's why the time element
is so essential.

1081
00:52:29,677 --> 00:52:31,083
Eel spoils quickly.

1082
00:52:31,123 --> 00:52:33,009
Mrs. Banks,
you're not eating.

1083
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:35,900
I had a martini
and a pink pill, and I think...

1084
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,184
Oh, please, please.

1085
00:52:37,224 --> 00:52:39,473
The temperature of the knichi
is very important.

1086
00:52:39,554 --> 00:52:41,039
You must eat it now.

1087
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:43,407
In five minutes,
we throw it away.

1088
00:52:43,488 --> 00:52:45,655
Wouldn't want you
to do that.

1089
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:47,161
Uh, no, no.
Pop it.

1090
00:52:47,201 --> 00:52:48,446
I beg
your pardon?

1091
00:52:48,486 --> 00:52:50,373
If you nibble,
knichi tastes bitter.

1092
00:52:50,413 --> 00:52:51,979
You must, uh, pop it.

1093
00:52:52,019 --> 00:52:52,982
Look.

1094
00:52:55,191 --> 00:52:56,073
See?

1095
00:52:56,154 --> 00:52:57,037
Oh, yes.

1096
00:52:59,205 --> 00:53:00,490
Ha ha ha ha.

1097
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:01,453
Here.

1098
00:53:01,493 --> 00:53:02,738
Oh. Thank you.

1099
00:53:09,081 --> 00:53:10,165
Are you O.K.?

1100
00:53:10,245 --> 00:53:12,735
I think I popped it
back too far.

1101
00:53:17,352 --> 00:53:18,796
Was that water?

1102
00:53:18,836 --> 00:53:21,206
No. Vodka. I use it
in the knichi.

1103
00:53:21,246 --> 00:53:22,450
Oh, my stomach.

1104
00:53:22,531 --> 00:53:24,859
Of course, the trick
is to pop it

1105
00:53:24,939 --> 00:53:27,187
right through the center
of the tongue.

1106
00:53:27,267 --> 00:53:30,359
Then it gets the benefit
of the entire palate. Corie.

1107
00:53:30,439 --> 00:53:32,326
Well... here goes.

1108
00:53:33,972 --> 00:53:35,377
How about that?

1109
00:53:35,417 --> 00:53:38,750
Perfect! You are the prettiest epicurean
I've ever seen.

1110
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:39,714
Paul.

1111
00:53:39,794 --> 00:53:42,884
No. No, thank you.
L... I have a bad arm.

1112
00:53:42,965 --> 00:53:45,454
You can try. Paul,
you have to try everything.

1113
00:53:45,534 --> 00:53:46,940
Right, Mr. Velasco?

1114
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:49,388
Well, as the French say,
at least once.

1115
00:53:57,699 --> 00:53:58,904
Ah.

1116
00:53:59,947 --> 00:54:00,871
Bitter.

1117
00:54:00,911 --> 00:54:01,834
Right?

1118
00:54:01,874 --> 00:54:03,440
You know why,
don't you?

1119
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,045
I nibbled,
I didn't pop.

1120
00:54:05,086 --> 00:54:06,972
Yeah. Have another.
Try to pop...

1121
00:54:07,013 --> 00:54:09,382
I don't care
to pop another one. Besides,

1122
00:54:09,422 --> 00:54:11,469
we're over
the five-minute limit.

1123
00:54:11,509 --> 00:54:13,878
Are we ready to go out
to dinner?

1124
00:54:13,918 --> 00:54:16,448
I thought we were having dinner
at your flat.

1125
00:54:16,488 --> 00:54:18,214
No. Our stove
caught fire.

1126
00:54:18,294 --> 00:54:19,539
Goodness.
What happened?

1127
00:54:19,619 --> 00:54:21,426
Nothing. We just
turned it on.

1128
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:23,353
If you're looking
for the unusual,

1129
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:24,718
I have
a suggestion.

1130
00:54:24,798 --> 00:54:26,162
That's what
we want...

1131
00:54:26,244 --> 00:54:27,447
The unusual,
right, Mother?

1132
00:54:27,528 --> 00:54:29,857
Oh, you know me...
one of the fellows.

1133
00:54:29,937 --> 00:54:32,265
Then we're off
to The Four Winds.

1134
00:54:32,345 --> 00:54:33,871
The Chinese restaurant,
53rd Street?

1135
00:54:33,951 --> 00:54:36,280
No, the Albanian restaurant
on Staten Island.

1136
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,564
We'll take
the ferry.

1137
00:54:37,645 --> 00:54:38,849
Ferry...
in February.

1138
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:41,258
I love it already!
Come on, Mother.

1139
00:54:41,338 --> 00:54:42,703
Paul, help her.

1140
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:46,798
It won't let go
of me. Ha ha! Oh...

1141
00:54:49,729 --> 00:54:53,061
Now, don't expect anything
lavish in the way of decor.

1142
00:54:53,101 --> 00:54:54,667
Actually,
I'm not even sure

1143
00:54:54,707 --> 00:54:56,594
that they have
a restaurant license.

1144
00:54:56,634 --> 00:54:59,485
Mr. Velasco,
don't you wear a coat?

1145
00:54:59,525 --> 00:55:01,412
Well, it's
only 30 degrees.

1146
00:55:01,452 --> 00:55:02,857
For me,
it's springtime.

1147
00:55:02,897 --> 00:55:05,266
Ready? My group,
stay close to me.

1148
00:55:05,306 --> 00:55:06,551
If anyone gets lost,

1149
00:55:06,591 --> 00:55:08,959
we'll meet
at the United States Embassy.

1150
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:13,135
Where were you?

1151
00:55:13,175 --> 00:55:14,419
Getting my gloves.

1152
00:55:14,459 --> 00:55:17,310
What do you need gloves for?
It's only 30 degrees.

1153
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:18,755
Oh. Sorry, I forgot.

1154
00:55:18,795 --> 00:55:20,448
We're having
a heat wave.

1155
00:55:27,169 --> 00:55:28,849
Do you have a dime?

1156
00:55:28,889 --> 00:55:29,928
Yeah.

1157
00:55:38,808 --> 00:55:40,688
Would you look
at her?

1158
00:55:40,728 --> 00:55:42,128
Look at her.

1159
00:55:45,327 --> 00:55:47,647
She's freezing to death,
but she wouldn't admit that.

1160
00:55:47,727 --> 00:55:50,007
I'll admit it.
I'm freezing to death.

1161
00:55:52,686 --> 00:55:55,007
Ah! Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

1162
00:55:57,006 --> 00:55:58,366
Ha ha ha! Hi!

1163
00:55:58,446 --> 00:55:59,326
Hello!

1164
00:55:59,406 --> 00:56:00,766
Ha ha ha!

1165
00:56:13,844 --> 00:56:14,885
Voila!

1166
00:56:16,684 --> 00:56:18,044
Come on, Mother.

1167
00:56:23,883 --> 00:56:26,683
Uh, listen, are you sure we're
in the right place?

1168
00:56:26,763 --> 00:56:28,763
Well... inhale.

1169
00:56:28,844 --> 00:56:29,923
This way.

1170
00:56:30,003 --> 00:56:31,123
Heavenly!

1171
00:56:33,002 --> 00:56:36,003
Em Shash Kepop...
The Four Winds.

1172
00:56:36,083 --> 00:56:37,923
I bid you now enter

1173
00:56:38,002 --> 00:56:40,042
a gastronomical
paradise.

1174
00:56:41,762 --> 00:56:43,122
Kishama!

1175
00:56:43,202 --> 00:56:44,562
Velasco!
Ha ha!

1176
00:56:44,641 --> 00:56:45,522
Ha ha!

1177
00:56:45,601 --> 00:56:46,802
Ha ha!

1178
00:56:48,002 --> 00:56:49,042
Mmm!

1179
00:56:49,121 --> 00:56:50,481
You taste
delicious!

1180
00:56:50,561 --> 00:56:53,041
You think so?
I put myself on the menu.

1181
00:56:53,121 --> 00:56:54,641
How many people
you got?

1182
00:56:54,721 --> 00:56:57,040
Four. All cold, all tired,
and all starving.

1183
00:56:57,121 --> 00:56:59,441
Good. First you drink,
then you eat,

1184
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,360
then you go
up to my bed

1185
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,279
and take
a little sleep, huh?

1186
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,479
Get up! Huh!

1187
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:20,038
Aha! Ouzo!

1188
00:57:20,078 --> 00:57:22,438
My beautiful,
beloved ouzo.

1189
00:57:22,479 --> 00:57:23,718
Paul,
do you drink?

1190
00:57:23,798 --> 00:57:26,438
Yes, thank you. Ouzo, I'd like
a Scotch, please.

1191
00:57:26,478 --> 00:57:28,358
No, no. Uh,
this is ouzo.

1192
00:57:28,398 --> 00:57:29,797
She is Mushka.

1193
00:57:29,837 --> 00:57:32,517
Paul, didn't you
know this was ouzo?

1194
00:57:32,558 --> 00:57:33,637
No.

1195
00:57:33,677 --> 00:57:35,077
Is the glass
dirty?

1196
00:57:35,116 --> 00:57:36,517
What color
is ouzo?

1197
00:57:36,557 --> 00:57:37,477
White.

1198
00:57:37,517 --> 00:57:38,477
It's dirty.

1199
00:57:44,876 --> 00:57:47,276
To the beginning
of new friendships.

1200
00:57:47,356 --> 00:57:50,156
Viznetz korvorsh
keyem buzu!

1201
00:57:50,196 --> 00:57:51,595
What does
that mean?

1202
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:54,115
I don't know.
I just made it up. Cheers!

1203
00:57:54,195 --> 00:57:55,314
Cheers!

1204
00:57:56,875 --> 00:57:57,755
Oh!

1205
00:57:57,834 --> 00:57:58,794
Whoo!

1206
00:57:58,874 --> 00:57:59,875
Wow!

1207
00:57:59,915 --> 00:58:01,314
Ha ha ha!
Whoo!

1208
00:58:01,354 --> 00:58:02,914
Here's to your
health, Mom.

1209
00:58:02,954 --> 00:58:04,634
Thank you.
To my health.

1210
00:58:07,114 --> 00:58:08,313
Have another one,
quickly.

1211
00:58:08,394 --> 00:58:09,593
No, thank you,
really.

1212
00:58:09,674 --> 00:58:11,513
Please. One
can make you sick.

1213
00:58:11,594 --> 00:58:13,833
Two starts you
on the road to recovery.

1214
00:58:16,553 --> 00:58:17,593
Pelmenchki!

1215
00:58:17,673 --> 00:58:18,873
I don't
believe it!

1216
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:21,192
Taste it.
You still won't believe it.

1217
00:58:21,272 --> 00:58:22,632
Pelmenchki!
For us!

1218
00:58:22,713 --> 00:58:25,032
He only makes it
twice a year.

1219
00:58:25,112 --> 00:58:28,791
If you like it,
I make you more next July.

1220
00:58:28,872 --> 00:58:29,751
Ha ha.

1221
00:58:29,832 --> 00:58:31,391
To pelmenchki.

1222
00:58:32,871 --> 00:58:35,992
Pour it in right away.
Otherwise, it goes sour.

1223
00:58:54,309 --> 00:58:56,229
Hey, it's Mushka.

Hey, I like that.
What are they playing?

1231
00:59:15,827 --> 00:59:17,667
It's an old
Albanian folk song.

1232
00:59:17,747 --> 00:59:19,267
What does
shama shama mean?

1233
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:21,667
Uh, Jimmy crack corn,
and I don't care.

1234
00:59:21,747 --> 00:59:22,627
No kidding.

I'll race you
up the stairs!

1261
01:00:49,778 --> 01:00:51,939
No! No! No!

1262
01:00:52,018 --> 01:00:52,899
Oh, you!

1263
01:00:52,978 --> 01:00:53,858
Oh!

1264
01:00:53,938 --> 01:00:55,298
Ha ha ha ha!

1265
01:00:55,378 --> 01:00:56,258
Oh!

01:00:56,338 --> 01:00:57,218
Ha ha!

1267
01:00:57,298 --> 01:00:58,657
No, you don't!

1268
01:00:58,737 --> 01:00:59,617
No! No!

1269
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:00,897
Aah! Aah!

1270
01:01:00,977 --> 01:01:01,857
Ha ha!

1271
01:01:02,897 --> 01:01:03,777
Whoo!

1272
01:01:05,617 --> 01:01:07,057
Ohhh, no.

1273
01:01:09,297 --> 01:01:10,857
I won!

1274
01:01:12,576 --> 01:01:15,216
I won. Ha ha
ha ha ha!

1275
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:17,776
That was not a fair race.
You tickled me.

1276
01:01:18,815 --> 01:01:21,175
Hey, how do you
say it again?

1277
01:01:21,216 --> 01:01:22,176
Say what?

1278
01:01:22,256 --> 01:01:24,575
Waiter, there's
a fly in my soup.

1279
01:01:24,655 --> 01:01:26,495
Oh. Poopla,
sirca al mercoori.

1280
01:01:26,575 --> 01:01:27,935
Sirca, poopla
al mercoori.

1281
01:01:28,015 --> 01:01:28,855
No, no.

1282
01:01:28,895 --> 01:01:29,934
No?

1283
01:01:30,015 --> 01:01:32,494
That's, "fly,
you have a waiter in my soup. "

1284
01:01:32,575 --> 01:01:35,894
I did. He put his hand in
to take out the fly.

1285
01:01:35,934 --> 01:01:37,334
Ha ha ha!

1286
01:01:37,374 --> 01:01:39,734
Ooh! How's my head
going to feel tomorrow?

1287
01:01:39,774 --> 01:01:40,693
Wonderful!

1288
01:01:40,734 --> 01:01:41,653
No headache?

1289
01:01:41,694 --> 01:01:43,573
No, but
you won't be able

1290
01:01:43,613 --> 01:01:46,453
to make a fist
for three days.

1291
01:01:46,493 --> 01:01:47,413
Hey!

1292
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:49,213
Look at that!

1293
01:01:49,293 --> 01:01:51,412
Coffee. We promised
to make coffee.

1294
01:01:51,493 --> 01:01:54,292
Oh! And a promise
is a promise!

1295
01:02:08,571 --> 01:02:10,451
I forgot the stove
doesn't work.

1296
01:02:10,491 --> 01:02:12,011
Hey, upstairs,
everybody, for coffee.

1297
01:02:12,091 --> 01:02:13,611
Don't you two
want coffee?

1298
01:02:13,691 --> 01:02:16,050
Oh, they'll drink it
if we make it.

1299
01:02:16,090 --> 01:02:18,930
Don't you two go away.
Shama shama el mal kema ma.

1300
01:02:27,729 --> 01:02:29,249
I feel like
we've died...

1301
01:02:30,768 --> 01:02:32,129
and gone to heaven...

1302
01:02:33,648 --> 01:02:35,488
only we had
to climb up.

1303
01:02:38,289 --> 01:02:41,088
Struck down
in the prime of life.

1304
01:02:41,167 --> 01:02:43,968
It isn't exactly
that I feel sick, just...

1305
01:02:44,047 --> 01:02:45,567
kind of numb...

1306
01:02:47,088 --> 01:02:49,407
and I can't
make a fist.

1307
01:02:52,287 --> 01:02:54,846
Mom, you want to hear
something frightening?

1308
01:02:57,487 --> 01:02:59,127
My teeth feel soft.

1309
01:03:00,686 --> 01:03:02,046
Huh. It's funny.

1310
01:03:02,126 --> 01:03:04,925
The best thing we had all night
was the knichi.

1311
01:03:05,006 --> 01:03:08,765
Ohh... anyway, Corie
had a good time.

1312
01:03:08,846 --> 01:03:12,165
She seems to get
such a terrific kick out of living.

1313
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:14,684
You've got to admire that,
don't you, Paul?

1314
01:03:14,765 --> 01:03:16,604
Yes, yes.
I admire anybody

1315
01:03:16,685 --> 01:03:19,005
who has three portions
of pelenchki.

1316
01:03:19,084 --> 01:03:20,444
I tried, Paul.

1317
01:03:20,524 --> 01:03:23,004
I just couldn't seem
to work up an appetite

1318
01:03:23,084 --> 01:03:24,204
the way they did.

1319
01:03:24,284 --> 01:03:26,124
No, you mustn't blame
yourself, Mom.

1320
01:03:26,204 --> 01:03:29,004
We're not used
to that kind of food, that's all.

1321
01:03:29,084 --> 01:03:30,923
You don't...
pick up a fork

1322
01:03:31,003 --> 01:03:32,843
and dig
into a black salad.

1323
01:03:32,923 --> 01:03:34,842
You got to play
with it.

1324
01:03:34,923 --> 01:03:37,362
I don't think I could get through
coffee tonight.

1325
01:03:37,442 --> 01:03:39,282
I'm all out
of pink pills.

1326
01:03:39,362 --> 01:03:40,562
Where you going?

1327
01:03:40,642 --> 01:03:43,122
Home. I'd like to die
in my own bed.

1328
01:03:43,202 --> 01:03:44,722
What will I
tell them?

1329
01:03:44,802 --> 01:03:46,642
Make up some
clever little lie.

1330
01:03:46,722 --> 01:03:49,522
Tell Corie I'm not
really her mother.

1331
01:03:50,881 --> 01:03:52,721
We've decided to have
flaming brandy.

1332
01:03:52,801 --> 01:03:55,121
I'm afraid you must
excuse me, darling,

1333
01:03:55,201 --> 01:03:57,041
but it is
a little late.

1334
01:03:57,121 --> 01:03:58,641
You can't go.
It's early.

1335
01:03:58,721 --> 01:04:01,520
I know, but I have a 10:00
dentist appointment at 9:00,

1336
01:04:01,601 --> 01:04:03,920
and it's been
a very long evening,

1337
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,320
and I don't know
what I'm saying.

1338
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,599
You can't do that.

1339
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,879
Darling.
Good night, Paul.

1340
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:10,159
Good night,
Mr. Velasco.

1341
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:11,439
Good night,
Paul.

1342
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:12,399
Good night.

1343
01:04:12,479 --> 01:04:13,679
Good night,
Corie.

1344
01:04:13,759 --> 01:04:14,959
You're not
going, too?

1345
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:17,319
Certainly. I'm driving
Mrs. Banks home.

1346
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:19,239
Oh, no. I mean,
it's too late.

1347
01:04:19,278 --> 01:04:20,318
For what?

1348
01:04:20,358 --> 01:04:23,398
The buses stop at 2:00.
How would you get home?

1349
01:04:23,478 --> 01:04:26,478
Why worry about that?
I'll meet that problem in New Jersey.

1350
01:04:26,557 --> 01:04:28,518
Really, Mr. Velasco,
it's very sweet...

1351
01:04:28,598 --> 01:04:29,477
Victor.

1352
01:04:29,558 --> 01:04:30,717
What?

1353
01:04:30,798 --> 01:04:33,277
If we're spending
the rest of the evening together,

1354
01:04:33,357 --> 01:04:36,197
it must be Victor. And I insist
the arrangement be reciprocal.

1355
01:04:36,237 --> 01:04:37,637
What is it?

1356
01:04:37,717 --> 01:04:39,476
What
is what?

1357
01:04:39,556 --> 01:04:40,637
Your name,
Mother.

1358
01:04:42,156 --> 01:04:43,596
It's Ethel.

1359
01:04:43,676 --> 01:04:46,436
Oh, yes. Ethel, that's right.
My name is Ethel.

1360
01:04:46,516 --> 01:04:48,955
That's better.
Are you ready... Ethel?

1361
01:04:49,036 --> 01:04:51,275
If you insist...
Walter.

1362
01:04:51,356 --> 01:04:52,515
Victor. It's Victor.

1363
01:04:52,596 --> 01:04:53,475
Yes, Victor.

1364
01:04:53,555 --> 01:04:54,635
Good night, Paul.

1365
01:04:56,155 --> 01:04:57,355
Shama shama, Corie.

1366
01:04:57,435 --> 01:04:58,315
Shama shama.

1367
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:00,195
If you don't hear
from us in a week,

1368
01:05:00,275 --> 01:05:02,594
we'll be at the Nacional Hotel
in Mexico City...

1369
01:05:02,675 --> 01:05:04,194
Room 703.
Come on, Ethel.

1370
01:05:04,274 --> 01:05:06,114
What did he mean
by that?

1371
01:05:06,194 --> 01:05:08,513
Stop worrying, Mother.
Call me in the morning.

1372
01:05:08,594 --> 01:05:09,473
Oh...

1373
01:05:11,314 --> 01:05:13,873
How about that?
He likes her!

1374
01:05:13,953 --> 01:05:15,833
He likes my mother!

1375
01:05:17,233 --> 01:05:19,033
He'll probably
have to sleep over.

1376
01:05:20,033 --> 01:05:21,593
Paul, do you
suppose that...

1377
01:05:21,633 --> 01:05:22,873
Not my mother.

1378
01:05:27,073 --> 01:05:28,952
Boy, what a night!

1379
01:05:31,072 --> 01:05:33,912
I got an idea. Let's take the bottle
of Scotch downstairs

1380
01:05:33,952 --> 01:05:36,311
and ring all the bells
and yell "police. "

1381
01:05:36,351 --> 01:05:39,191
Huh? Just to see who comes out
of whose apartment?

1382
01:05:39,231 --> 01:05:41,591
What's the matter, darling?
Don't you feel well?

1383
01:05:41,630 --> 01:05:43,511
What a rotten
thing to do,

1384
01:05:43,550 --> 01:05:47,190
dragging your mother out like that
into the middle of the harbor

1385
01:05:47,231 --> 01:05:49,310
for a bowl
of sheep dip.

1386
01:05:52,830 --> 01:05:55,589
It was Greek bean soup.

1387
01:05:57,189 --> 01:05:59,069
And at least
she tasted it.

1388
01:05:59,109 --> 01:06:01,469
She didn't jab at it
with her knife

1389
01:06:01,508 --> 01:06:03,029
throwing cute
little epigrams like,

1390
01:06:03,108 --> 01:06:05,748
"Ho, ho, ho. I think
there's somebody in there. "

1391
01:06:05,829 --> 01:06:08,188
That's, um... quite
a match you made.

1392
01:06:08,228 --> 01:06:10,588
I can just hear the conversation.
Sparkling dialogue.

1393
01:06:10,628 --> 01:06:12,988
He's telling her about some great
Japanese restaurant

1394
01:06:13,028 --> 01:06:14,908
in East Berlin,
and she's describing

1395
01:06:14,948 --> 01:06:17,468
the joys of having
a root canal job.

1396
01:06:19,827 --> 01:06:21,347
Give me your
hand, Ethel.

1397
01:06:21,427 --> 01:06:22,307
My what?

1398
01:06:22,387 --> 01:06:24,707
Your hand. There is ice
on the stoop.

1399
01:06:24,787 --> 01:06:26,667
Don't worry about me.
I can manage.

1400
01:06:26,746 --> 01:06:27,746
Ohhh!

1401
01:06:33,106 --> 01:06:33,986
Ethel.

1402
01:06:34,066 --> 01:06:35,426
Are you all right?

1403
01:06:35,506 --> 01:06:36,545
Uhhh...

1404
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:37,986
Ohhh...

1405
01:06:38,066 --> 01:06:39,505
Well.

1406
01:06:50,705 --> 01:06:52,064
I just can't
understand

1407
01:06:52,144 --> 01:06:54,624
how you can be so unconcerned
about all this.

1408
01:06:54,704 --> 01:06:56,423
- Unconcerned?
- I really...

1409
01:06:56,504 --> 01:06:58,983
Do you think
I'll get one wink of sleep

1410
01:06:59,063 --> 01:07:00,583
until that phone
rings tomorrow?

1411
01:07:00,663 --> 01:07:02,983
I'm scared to death
for my mother.

1412
01:07:03,063 --> 01:07:05,862
And I'm grateful there's finally
something to be scared about.

1413
01:07:07,263 --> 01:07:09,623
What I'm really
concerned about is you.

1414
01:07:11,662 --> 01:07:12,542
Me?

1415
01:07:12,622 --> 01:07:14,222
Me?

1416
01:07:14,302 --> 01:07:15,822
Yeah. I'm beginning
to wonder

1417
01:07:15,902 --> 01:07:18,261
if you're capable
of having a good time.

1418
01:07:18,302 --> 01:07:21,141
Why? Because I like
to wear my gloves in winter?

1419
01:07:21,181 --> 01:07:24,501
No. Because there isn't the least bit
of adventure in you.

1420
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:28,340
You know what you are, Paul?
You're a watcher.

1421
01:07:28,381 --> 01:07:30,860
You're a watcher.
There are watchers in this world,

1422
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:32,140
and there are doers.

1423
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:34,700
And the watchers
sit around watching the doers do.

1424
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:36,660
Tonight you watched,
and I did.

1425
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:39,540
It was a little harder
to watch what you did

1426
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:42,420
than it was for you to do
what I was watching.

1427
01:07:42,459 --> 01:07:44,819
You can't even relax
for one evening.

1428
01:07:44,859 --> 01:07:47,339
I don't know, Paul,
sometimes you act like a...

1429
01:07:47,419 --> 01:07:49,778
What? Hmm? A stuffed shirt?
Is that it?

1430
01:07:49,818 --> 01:07:51,018
I didn't say that.

1431
01:07:51,098 --> 01:07:52,618
That's what you
were implying.

1432
01:07:52,698 --> 01:07:53,898
That's what
you're anticipating.

1433
01:07:53,978 --> 01:07:55,498
I didn't say
stuffed shirt.

1434
01:07:55,578 --> 01:07:56,698
Mm-hmm.

1435
01:07:57,818 --> 01:07:59,497
But you're extremely
proper and dignified.

1436
01:08:03,898 --> 01:08:06,418
Proper and dignified?
When was I proper and dignified?

1437
01:08:06,497 --> 01:08:08,976
The other night at Delfino's,
you were drunk, right?

1438
01:08:09,057 --> 01:08:10,256
Right.
I was stoned.

1439
01:08:10,337 --> 01:08:12,136
Exactly. I didn't
even know it

1440
01:08:12,176 --> 01:08:14,577
until you told me
in the morning.

1441
01:08:14,656 --> 01:08:17,456
Uhh... I mean, you're a funny kind
of drunk, Paul.

1442
01:08:17,536 --> 01:08:20,816
You just sat around looking unhappy,
watching your coat.

1443
01:08:20,896 --> 01:08:22,416
I was watching
my coat

1444
01:08:22,496 --> 01:08:24,815
because I saw someone else
watching my coat.

1445
01:08:24,895 --> 01:08:27,375
If you want, I'll get drunk
for you sometime,

1446
01:08:27,455 --> 01:08:29,295
make your hair
stand on end.

1447
01:08:29,375 --> 01:08:32,654
In Harry's Bar last New Year's Eve,
I punched an old woman.

1448
01:08:32,734 --> 01:08:34,254
Don't tell me
about drunk.

1449
01:08:36,814 --> 01:08:39,893
When else? When else
was I proper and dignified?

1450
01:08:39,974 --> 01:08:41,334
All the time.

1451
01:08:41,414 --> 01:08:42,773
You're always
dressed right.

1452
01:08:42,854 --> 01:08:44,214
You always look right.

1453
01:08:44,294 --> 01:08:46,973
You always say
the right thing.

1454
01:08:47,053 --> 01:08:48,733
You're very nearly
perfect.

1455
01:08:48,813 --> 01:08:51,892
That's a rotten
thing to say.

1456
01:08:51,973 --> 01:08:54,772
Before we were married,
I thought you slept with a tie.

1457
01:08:54,852 --> 01:08:56,292
Just for formal sleeps.

1458
01:08:56,372 --> 01:08:58,732
You have absolutely no sense
of the ridiculous.

1459
01:08:58,772 --> 01:09:00,092
Like last
Thursday night,

1460
01:09:00,172 --> 01:09:03,291
you wouldn't walk barefoot with me in
Washington Square Park.

1461
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:04,251
Why not?

1462
01:09:04,332 --> 01:09:06,211
Simple answer.
It was 17 degrees.

1463
01:09:06,292 --> 01:09:08,572
Exactly. It's very logical,
it's very sensible,

1464
01:09:08,651 --> 01:09:09,771
and it's no fun.

1465
01:09:09,852 --> 01:09:11,691
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I am

1466
01:09:11,770 --> 01:09:14,251
a little bit too proper
and dignified for you.

1467
01:09:14,330 --> 01:09:15,850
Maybe you would've
been happier

1468
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:19,010
with somebody a little more colorful and
flamboyant... like the geek.

1469
01:09:19,090 --> 01:09:21,930
It'd be a lot more laughs than
a stuffed shirt.

1470
01:09:21,970 --> 01:09:23,170
You said I wasn't.

1471
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:25,049
Well, you are now.

1472
01:09:25,130 --> 01:09:26,649
I'm not listening
to this.

1473
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:29,050
I have a court case
in the morning.

1474
01:09:29,129 --> 01:09:30,330
Where are you going?

1475
01:09:30,409 --> 01:09:31,289
To sleep.

1476
01:09:31,369 --> 01:09:32,569
How can you now?

1477
01:09:32,649 --> 01:09:35,128
I'll close my eyes
and count knichis. Good night.

1478
01:09:35,209 --> 01:09:37,648
You cannot sleep now.
We're having a fight.

1479
01:09:37,728 --> 01:09:40,769
You have the fight. When you're
through, turn off these lights.

1480
01:09:40,848 --> 01:09:42,368
That gets me
absolutely insane!

1481
01:09:42,448 --> 01:09:44,528
You can even control
your emotions!

1482
01:09:44,607 --> 01:09:47,087
No, no. I'm just as upset
as you are.

1483
01:09:47,167 --> 01:09:49,967
But when I'm hungry, I eat.
When I'm tired, I sleep.

1484
01:09:50,047 --> 01:09:51,927
I've seen you
eat and sleep.

1485
01:09:52,007 --> 01:09:53,607
Not in midcrisis.

1486
01:09:53,687 --> 01:09:55,686
What crisis?
We're just yelling.

1487
01:09:55,767 --> 01:09:57,487
You don't consider
this a crisis!

1488
01:09:57,566 --> 01:09:59,726
Our whole marriage
is hanging in the balance.

1489
01:09:59,806 --> 01:10:00,686
It is?

1490
01:10:00,766 --> 01:10:02,126
When did this happen?

1491
01:10:02,207 --> 01:10:04,686
Just now. It's suddenly become
very clear to me

1492
01:10:04,765 --> 01:10:07,406
that you and I have
absolutely nothing in common.

1493
01:10:07,486 --> 01:10:09,965
Because I won't
go walking barefoot in the park?

1494
01:10:10,046 --> 01:10:12,286
No case. Adultery, yes,
but cold feet, no.

1495
01:10:12,326 --> 01:10:15,804
Don't you oversimplify this.
I am angry. Can't you see that?

1496
01:10:15,885 --> 01:10:19,205
It's 2:15. If I can get to sleep
in half an hour,

1497
01:10:19,245 --> 01:10:21,044
I'll get
about 5 hours sleep.

1498
01:10:21,125 --> 01:10:24,244
I'll call you from court tomorrow,
and we'll fight by phone.

1499
01:10:24,324 --> 01:10:25,844
You won't go to sleep!

1500
01:10:25,923 --> 01:10:28,284
You'll stay here
and fight to save our marriage!

1501
01:10:28,364 --> 01:10:30,844
If our marriage hinges
on those fishbowls and pelmenchki,

1502
01:10:30,924 --> 01:10:34,243
it's not worth saving.
Care to join me in our tiny bed?

1503
01:10:34,283 --> 01:10:36,642
We're sleeping from left
to right tonight.

1504
01:10:36,683 --> 01:10:40,482
You won't discuss it!
You're afraid to discuss it!

1505
01:10:40,522 --> 01:10:42,362
I married a...
a coward!

1506
01:10:42,522 --> 01:10:44,962
Would you bring in a pail?
The closet's dripping.

1507
01:10:45,042 --> 01:10:46,401
Oh, I hate you!

1508
01:10:46,482 --> 01:10:48,162
I really,
really hate you!

1509
01:10:48,242 --> 01:10:50,082
There's one thing
I've learned in court.

1510
01:10:50,162 --> 01:10:52,121
Be careful when
you're tired and angry.

1511
01:10:52,161 --> 01:10:54,041
You may say something
you'll regret.

1512
01:10:54,081 --> 01:10:55,641
I am now tired and angry.

1513
01:10:55,721 --> 01:10:57,241
And a coward!

1514
01:10:57,281 --> 01:10:58,361
Maybe you're right.

1515
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,761
Maybe we don't have
anything in common.

1516
01:11:00,801 --> 01:11:02,200
Two people
should have more

1517
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:04,041
than just
a blood test first.

1518
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:06,440
Maybe they should
be checked first

1519
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:08,360
for a little common sense,
understanding,

1520
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:09,799
and emotional maturity!

1521
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:12,679
All right. Why don't
you get it passed

1522
01:11:12,759 --> 01:11:14,120
by the Supreme Court?

1523
01:11:14,199 --> 01:11:17,000
Only those couples bearing a certificate
from their psychiatrist

1524
01:11:17,079 --> 01:11:19,878
proving that they're
emotionally mature can be married.

1525
01:11:21,079 --> 01:11:21,959
Oh, listen...

1526
01:11:22,039 --> 01:11:22,919
Don't touch me!

1527
01:11:22,999 --> 01:11:24,839
Don't lay
a finger on me!

1528
01:11:24,918 --> 01:11:27,238
I can't stand
to have you near me!

1529
01:11:27,318 --> 01:11:30,917
I don't want to be
in the same room with you!

1530
01:11:30,998 --> 01:11:31,877
You're hysterical.

1531
01:11:31,957 --> 01:11:32,998
I am not hysterical!

1532
01:11:33,078 --> 01:11:34,918
I know exactly
what I'm saying.

1533
01:11:34,997 --> 01:11:36,357
It's all over
between us.

1534
01:11:36,437 --> 01:11:38,757
It's never going
to be any good anymore.

1535
01:11:38,837 --> 01:11:41,157
I'm sorry.
I don't want to cry.

1536
01:11:41,237 --> 01:11:42,356
Cry, please. Go ahead.

1537
01:11:42,437 --> 01:11:44,316
Don't tell me
when to cry!

1538
01:11:44,357 --> 01:11:46,716
I'll cry when
I feel like crying.

1539
01:11:46,756 --> 01:11:49,746
I won't cry until you're
out of this apartment.

1540
01:11:49,825 --> 01:11:51,260
What do you mean?

1541
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:55,843
You certainly don't think we're
going to live here anymore, do you?

1542
01:11:55,923 --> 01:11:56,840
After this?

1543
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:58,434
Are you serious?

1544
01:11:58,514 --> 01:11:59,869
Of course
I'm serious, Paul!

1545
01:11:59,949 --> 01:12:01,224
I want a divorce!

1546
01:12:01,304 --> 01:12:02,460
Divorce!

1547
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:04,214
I'm sorry.
I can't discuss it anymore.

1548
01:12:04,293 --> 01:12:05,528
Where are you going?

1549
01:12:05,608 --> 01:12:06,485
To bed.

1550
01:12:06,565 --> 01:12:07,721
You can't, not now.

1551
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,196
You did before.

1552
01:12:09,236 --> 01:12:10,271
During a fight.

1553
01:12:10,351 --> 01:12:11,747
This is during
a divorce.

1554
01:12:11,787 --> 01:12:14,098
I can't talk to you when
you're hysterical.

1555
01:12:14,178 --> 01:12:17,765
I want to know why
you want a divorce.

1556
01:12:18,961 --> 01:12:19,837
Huh?

1557
01:12:22,150 --> 01:12:23,066
Why?

1558
01:12:24,541 --> 01:12:28,327
Because you and I have absolutely
nothing in common.

1559
01:12:28,367 --> 01:12:29,761
Nothing in common?

1560
01:12:29,801 --> 01:12:33,110
What about the six days
at the Plaza, Corie?

1561
01:12:33,150 --> 01:12:35,980
Six days does
not a week make.

1562
01:12:37,454 --> 01:12:39,009
What does that mean?

1563
01:12:42,237 --> 01:12:43,632
I don't know!

1564
01:12:43,672 --> 01:12:46,024
I don't know
what it means.

1565
01:12:48,933 --> 01:12:52,241
All I know is
that I want a divorce.

1566
01:12:54,672 --> 01:12:57,502
You know,
I think you mean it.

1567
01:12:57,542 --> 01:12:58,857
You mean this?

1568
01:12:58,937 --> 01:13:00,771
I do.

1569
01:13:00,851 --> 01:13:02,684
I really do.

1570
01:13:06,589 --> 01:13:08,423
Let's just...

1571
01:13:08,503 --> 01:13:09,698
think.

1572
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:17,511
I thought you
weren't going to cry.

1573
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:18,945
Well, I am!

1574
01:13:19,025 --> 01:13:21,336
I'm going to have
the biggest cry

1575
01:13:21,416 --> 01:13:24,206
I've ever had
in my whole life,

1576
01:13:24,286 --> 01:13:26,119
and I'm going
to enjoy it!

1577
01:13:26,199 --> 01:13:27,236
I'll cry so hard

1578
01:13:27,315 --> 01:13:29,627
I'll keep you
awake all night.

1579
01:13:29,707 --> 01:13:31,380
Good night, Paul.

1580
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:32,816
I mean goodbye.

1581
01:14:03,824 --> 01:14:06,774
Six days does
not a week make.

1582
01:14:15,941 --> 01:14:18,731
It's for you. I don't
live here anymore.

1583
01:14:23,912 --> 01:14:25,387
Fine. Fine.

1584
01:14:26,941 --> 01:14:29,731
You work and work
for a lousy 6 cents.

1585
01:14:36,985 --> 01:14:39,775
I don't even care.

1586
01:14:39,855 --> 01:14:41,688
I don't know...

1587
01:14:41,768 --> 01:14:43,123
why I even bother.

1588
01:14:43,203 --> 01:14:45,560
It's just...
it's just nothing.

1589
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,157
One pound of grapes.

1590
01:15:28,237 --> 01:15:29,116
Anything else?

1591
01:15:29,196 --> 01:15:30,594
No, thank you.

1592
01:15:40,221 --> 01:15:42,538
Ah-choo!

1593
01:15:42,618 --> 01:15:44,936
God bless him.

1594
01:15:45,015 --> 01:15:47,812
If that's for tonight,
you needn't bother.

1595
01:15:47,892 --> 01:15:49,250
I have my own dinner.

1596
01:15:49,330 --> 01:15:51,168
I thought you
were moving out.

1597
01:15:51,247 --> 01:15:55,442
I haven't had a chance
to look for a room yet.

1598
01:15:55,482 --> 01:15:56,880
I work during the day.

1599
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:57,998
You'll look tonight.

1600
01:15:58,038 --> 01:15:59,916
I'm coming down
with a cold.

1601
01:15:59,956 --> 01:16:01,834
That's why
I'm home early.

1602
01:16:01,874 --> 01:16:05,668
I thought I'd take aspirins and get
right into the sofa.

1603
01:16:05,708 --> 01:16:07,586
I'm sure you
can find someplace.

1604
01:16:07,626 --> 01:16:09,503
You can stay
at your club.

1605
01:16:09,543 --> 01:16:12,379
It's not that kind
of a club.

1606
01:16:12,419 --> 01:16:15,256
It's a locker room
and a handball court.

1607
01:16:15,296 --> 01:16:18,692
To sleep over, I'd have
to keep winning the serve.

1608
01:16:18,772 --> 01:16:20,609
Hello, Mrs. Bratter,
Mr. Bratter.

1609
01:16:20,689 --> 01:16:22,766
How's every
little thing?

1610
01:16:22,846 --> 01:16:24,204
The little things
are fine.

1611
01:16:24,284 --> 01:16:26,641
Shall I charge it,
Mr. Bratter?

1612
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:29,997
Charge it to Mrs. Bratter.
It's a new account.

1613
01:16:30,036 --> 01:16:31,794
The grapes are his.

1614
01:16:47,733 --> 01:16:48,772
It's open!

1615
01:16:50,450 --> 01:16:51,448
Hi.

1616
01:16:51,528 --> 01:16:52,407
Hello again.

1617
01:16:52,487 --> 01:16:53,845
Phone's out
of order.

1618
01:16:53,925 --> 01:16:55,284
Yeah. I know.

1619
01:16:55,364 --> 01:16:58,639
I wouldn't be up here
on a social call.

1620
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:01,515
Hey, you did
a real nice job.

1621
01:17:01,595 --> 01:17:02,474
Thank you.

1622
01:17:02,554 --> 01:17:05,351
Know anybody that
might want to rent it?

1623
01:17:05,431 --> 01:17:07,268
Rent it?
You moving already?

1624
01:17:07,348 --> 01:17:09,665
I'm looking
for a smaller place.

1625
01:17:09,745 --> 01:17:12,541
Smaller than this,
they're not easy to find.

1626
01:17:12,621 --> 01:17:14,938
How do you
like married life?

1627
01:17:15,018 --> 01:17:16,176
Very interesting.

1628
01:17:18,852 --> 01:17:19,732
Hello.

1629
01:17:19,812 --> 01:17:20,850
I'm the
telephone man.

1630
01:17:20,930 --> 01:17:22,248
I'm the husband.

1631
01:17:23,926 --> 01:17:27,562
Well, let's see what's
wrong with the phone.

1632
01:17:46,097 --> 01:17:47,774
It's dead.

1633
01:17:47,814 --> 01:17:50,771
I know. It was
murdered last night.

1634
01:17:54,366 --> 01:17:57,681
I'll be out of here
as fast as I can.

1635
01:17:57,721 --> 01:17:58,800
Take your time.

1636
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,917
Nobody's rushing you.

1637
01:18:06,191 --> 01:18:09,785
Is there any beer
in the house?

1638
01:18:15,738 --> 01:18:19,053
I said, "Is there any beer
in the house?"

1639
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:24,047
Would you
like me to look?

1640
01:18:24,126 --> 01:18:26,483
There's no beer
in the house.

1641
01:18:26,563 --> 01:18:28,840
There is no beer.

1642
01:18:34,473 --> 01:18:35,672
Ah!

1643
01:18:38,787 --> 01:18:40,146
That's my trouble... beer.

1644
01:18:40,226 --> 01:18:43,981
I can drink 10 cans
in a night... of beer.

1645
01:18:51,651 --> 01:18:52,889
Ahh!

1646
01:19:04,594 --> 01:19:06,831
My laundry come back today?

1647
01:19:11,305 --> 01:19:14,101
Yes, your laundry
came back today.

1648
01:19:14,181 --> 01:19:16,858
They stuffed your shirts
beautifully.

1649
01:19:25,686 --> 01:19:28,402
Would you
like a drink?

1650
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:32,277
I said, "Would you
like a drink?"

1651
01:19:32,317 --> 01:19:33,716
Who? Me?

1652
01:19:33,756 --> 01:19:34,754
Yeah.

1653
01:19:34,834 --> 01:19:35,793
No.

1654
01:19:35,873 --> 01:19:36,992
Right.

1655
01:19:42,464 --> 01:19:45,220
Just one more little screw
will do it.

1656
01:19:46,459 --> 01:19:47,817
There. I'm finished.

1657
01:19:47,897 --> 01:19:48,776
I'm finished.

1658
01:19:48,856 --> 01:19:51,771
Aah!

1659
01:19:55,327 --> 01:19:57,684
Hello. Yes, it is.

1660
01:19:57,724 --> 01:19:59,122
Just a moment.

1661
01:19:59,162 --> 01:20:00,560
It's Aunt Harriet.

1662
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:03,077
I don't have
an Aunt Harriet.

1663
01:20:06,832 --> 01:20:09,668
I guess you won't
be needing me anymore.

1664
01:20:09,708 --> 01:20:10,627
Goodbye.

1665
01:20:10,667 --> 01:20:13,742
Aunt Harriet,
can you hang on a second?

1666
01:20:13,822 --> 01:20:16,539
When do I get it?

1667
01:20:16,579 --> 01:20:17,578
Get what?

1668
01:20:17,658 --> 01:20:19,335
When do I get my divorce?

1669
01:20:19,415 --> 01:20:20,335
I don't know.

1670
01:20:20,414 --> 01:20:22,052
They didn't send
the marriage license yet.

1671
01:20:22,132 --> 01:20:23,729
I want you out tonight.

1672
01:20:23,769 --> 01:20:25,168
Fine.
I'll get my bag.

1673
01:20:25,208 --> 01:20:27,085
I'll pack
my wet suits.

1674
01:20:27,125 --> 01:20:28,363
Hi, Aunt Harriet.
What's wrong?

1675
01:20:28,403 --> 01:20:30,282
I'll go sleep
in the park,

1676
01:20:30,322 --> 01:20:32,199
where it's
dry and warm.

1677
01:20:32,239 --> 01:20:34,116
No, Mother's not with me.

1678
01:20:34,156 --> 01:20:36,513
She left about
2:00 this morning.

1679
01:20:36,553 --> 01:20:39,389
Yeah? What happened?

1680
01:20:39,429 --> 01:20:40,827
What?

1681
01:20:40,867 --> 01:20:43,144
Mother?

1682
01:20:43,224 --> 01:20:44,103
My mother?

1683
01:20:44,183 --> 01:20:45,541
Are you sure?

1684
01:20:45,621 --> 01:20:47,459
What's the matter?
What happened?

1685
01:20:47,539 --> 01:20:50,814
No. My phone's been
out of order all day.

1686
01:20:50,894 --> 01:20:51,933
Don't get excited.

1687
01:20:52,013 --> 01:20:53,211
I'll call you back

1688
01:20:53,291 --> 01:20:55,608
as soon as I find out
anything. Goodbye.

1689
01:20:55,688 --> 01:20:57,046
What's wrong
with your mother?

1690
01:20:57,126 --> 01:20:58,964
Mother didn't
come home last night.

1691
01:20:59,044 --> 01:21:00,721
Her bed hasn't
been slept in.

1692
01:21:00,801 --> 01:21:01,840
I'm calling the police.

1693
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,237
Take it easy.
There's nothing to be...

1694
01:21:04,317 --> 01:21:06,154
Maybe her back
was bothering her,

1695
01:21:06,234 --> 01:21:08,551
and she fell asleep
on the ironing board.

1696
01:21:08,631 --> 01:21:10,948
Would you just go away.
Just go away.

1697
01:21:11,028 --> 01:21:12,386
Where are you going?

1698
01:21:12,465 --> 01:21:14,544
Upstairs to find out
what happened to mother.

1699
01:21:14,584 --> 01:21:15,981
You better not come back.

1700
01:21:16,021 --> 01:21:18,138
I'm buying
a big dog tomorrow.

1701
01:21:18,218 --> 01:21:21,574
You'll have somebody
to walk barefoot in the park with.

1702
01:21:21,654 --> 01:21:23,052
A dog. That's a laugh.

1703
01:21:23,092 --> 01:21:25,928
When she tries
to take him for a walk,

1704
01:21:25,968 --> 01:21:27,726
he'll get one look
at those stairs

1705
01:21:27,806 --> 01:21:29,803
and go right
for her throat.

1706
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:35,156
Mr. Velasco, can I see you
for a minute?

1707
01:21:35,196 --> 01:21:37,553
A little dog.
A little doggie.

1708
01:21:37,593 --> 01:21:39,870
I don't need anybody
to protect me, sweetheart,

1709
01:21:39,950 --> 01:21:43,945
because I am a man,
independent, mature,

1710
01:21:44,025 --> 01:21:47,140
self-sufficient
man... ah-choo!

1711
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:49,217
Oh! God bless me.

1712
01:21:49,297 --> 01:21:51,614
I've probably got the flu.

1713
01:21:51,694 --> 01:21:53,532
Yeah.

1714
01:21:53,612 --> 01:21:56,927
Chills, fever, sweaty.

1715
01:21:56,967 --> 01:21:59,284
Probably have
a 24-hour virus.

1716
01:22:01,281 --> 01:22:04,078
Better tomorrow
at a quarter to 4:00.

1717
01:22:05,596 --> 01:22:08,073
Oh!

1718
01:22:08,393 --> 01:22:09,951
Thanks. Thanks a lot, pal.

1719
01:22:10,030 --> 01:22:11,828
And thus it was written.

1720
01:22:11,908 --> 01:22:13,745
Some shall die
by pestilence,

1721
01:22:13,825 --> 01:22:15,184
some by the plague,

1722
01:22:15,264 --> 01:22:16,302
and one poor schnook

1723
01:22:16,382 --> 01:22:19,658
will get it from a hole
in the ceiling.

1724
01:22:21,815 --> 01:22:22,694
Ahh!

1725
01:22:22,774 --> 01:22:23,972
That's it. That's it.

1726
01:22:26,489 --> 01:22:27,927
Goodbye, leaky closet.

1727
01:22:30,004 --> 01:22:32,601
Bye, no bathtub.

1728
01:22:32,681 --> 01:22:33,799
Bye, hole.

1729
01:22:35,078 --> 01:22:37,794
Goodbye, six flights.

1730
01:22:37,873 --> 01:22:38,753
Oh!

1731
01:22:38,832 --> 01:22:39,712
Goodbye,
Corie.

1732
01:22:39,792 --> 01:22:41,149
Oh, no goodbye?

1733
01:22:41,229 --> 01:22:43,107
According to law,
I'm entitled to...

1734
01:22:43,147 --> 01:22:44,026
Goodbye!

1735
01:22:45,543 --> 01:22:46,423
What?

1736
01:22:46,503 --> 01:22:48,180
Is it your mother?

1737
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:50,577
Corie, what is it,
an accident?

1738
01:22:50,657 --> 01:22:52,534
For Pete's sake,
what's it about?

1739
01:22:52,574 --> 01:22:55,410
It's not the way
it looks at all!

1740
01:22:55,450 --> 01:22:56,330
Boo-hoo!

1741
01:22:56,410 --> 01:22:57,289
Good God.

1742
01:22:57,369 --> 01:22:59,246
Corie, you've
got to believe me.

1743
01:22:59,286 --> 01:23:00,724
Somebody believe me.

1744
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:05,917
I warned her.

1745
01:23:05,957 --> 01:23:08,793
I warned her,
and I was right.

1746
01:23:09,233 --> 01:23:11,150
He warned me,
and he was right.

1747
01:23:11,230 --> 01:23:13,108
It must have
been the drinks.

1748
01:23:13,147 --> 01:23:15,984
I had a great deal
to drink last night...

1749
01:23:16,024 --> 01:23:18,341
Martinis, vodka, coffee,
black bean soup, and ouzos.

1750
01:23:20,818 --> 01:23:22,215
That's not
my problem.

1751
01:23:22,255 --> 01:23:24,612
I'm well
out of it now.

1752
01:23:27,528 --> 01:23:28,647
Ahh!

1753
01:23:39,353 --> 01:23:40,392
Then after I fell,

1754
01:23:40,472 --> 01:23:42,829
Victor picked me up
and carried me inside.

1755
01:23:42,869 --> 01:23:46,185
I couldn't walk because
my shoes fell down the sewer.

1756
01:23:46,225 --> 01:23:47,622
You don't have
to explain.

1757
01:23:47,662 --> 01:23:49,540
He started
to carry me here,

1758
01:23:49,580 --> 01:23:51,936
but his hat
fell over his eyes,

1759
01:23:51,976 --> 01:23:54,813
and we fell down the stairs
into apartment 3C.

1760
01:23:54,853 --> 01:23:56,251
I fell on his foot.

1761
01:23:56,291 --> 01:23:58,647
I thought we'd
have a nice evening.

1762
01:23:58,687 --> 01:24:00,566
Mr. Gonzales, Mr. Armandariz,
and Mr. Calhoun

1763
01:24:00,606 --> 01:24:02,003
carried us both
up there

1764
01:24:02,043 --> 01:24:04,400
and put us down
on the rugs.

1765
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:06,317
When I awoke,
Victor was gone,

1766
01:24:06,357 --> 01:24:08,714
and I was there
in his bathrobe.

1767
01:24:08,754 --> 01:24:11,271
I swear that's
the truth, Corie!

1768
01:24:15,945 --> 01:24:17,344
Got a cold.

1769
01:24:17,383 --> 01:24:19,740
I've had one
for 20 years.

1770
01:24:26,491 --> 01:24:28,848
Ahh!

1771
01:24:28,888 --> 01:24:32,604
Gee, that's a nice coat
you got there.

1772
01:24:32,683 --> 01:24:34,041
What?

1773
01:24:34,121 --> 01:24:35,001
Huh?

1774
01:24:35,081 --> 01:24:35,959
Your coat.

1775
01:24:36,039 --> 01:24:39,794
I'll make you a trade.
What have you got?

1776
01:24:39,874 --> 01:24:41,552
Nothing.

1777
01:24:41,632 --> 01:24:43,029
It's a deal!

1778
01:24:45,666 --> 01:24:48,502
You must believe me.
I've told you everything.

1779
01:24:48,542 --> 01:24:49,940
Then where
are your clothes?

1780
01:24:49,980 --> 01:24:51,858
That I can't tell you.

1781
01:24:51,898 --> 01:24:52,816
Why not?

1782
01:24:52,856 --> 01:24:54,255
You won't believe me.

1783
01:24:54,295 --> 01:24:56,652
I will. Mother,
where are your clothes?

1784
01:24:56,692 --> 01:24:58,090
I don't know.

1785
01:24:58,130 --> 01:24:59,528
I don't believe you.

1786
01:24:59,567 --> 01:25:02,404
Didn't I tell you
you wouldn't believe me?

1787
01:25:02,444 --> 01:25:04,322
I don't know
where they are.

1788
01:25:04,362 --> 01:25:06,239
I've never
been so humiliated.

1789
01:25:06,279 --> 01:25:09,116
I kept having
the most horrible nightmares.

1790
01:25:09,156 --> 01:25:11,991
I kept dreaming
my fingers were falling off

1791
01:25:12,031 --> 01:25:14,788
because I couldn't
make a fist. Ohh!

1792
01:25:15,987 --> 01:25:17,264
It's me.

1793
01:25:21,698 --> 01:25:23,896
Mr. Velasco,
are you all right?

1794
01:25:23,975 --> 01:25:27,731
If a broken toe
is all right, I'm fine.

1795
01:25:27,811 --> 01:25:28,610
Hello, Ethel.

1796
01:25:28,690 --> 01:25:30,048
Hello, Victor...
Mr. Victor...

1797
01:25:30,128 --> 01:25:31,007
Mr. Velasco.

1798
01:25:31,087 --> 01:25:33,404
I couldn't get up
the ladder again.

1799
01:25:33,484 --> 01:25:35,801
Did you tell Corie
what happened last night?

1800
01:25:35,881 --> 01:25:37,238
Why? What happened
last night?

1801
01:25:37,318 --> 01:25:38,198
Ooh, last night.
Yes.

1802
01:25:38,277 --> 01:25:39,316
Take his arm,
Mother.

1803
01:25:39,395 --> 01:25:42,991
I knew I would come to this,
being helped by women.

1804
01:25:43,071 --> 01:25:45,388
Oh, dear, does
your foot hurt?

1805
01:25:45,468 --> 01:25:47,265
Compared
to my stomach, no.

1806
01:25:47,345 --> 01:25:49,662
I think I have
a new ailment

1807
01:25:49,742 --> 01:25:51,579
which I shall call
"intestinal volcano. "

1808
01:25:51,659 --> 01:25:53,976
Are there little men
in there

1809
01:25:54,056 --> 01:25:55,894
running around
in spiked shoes?

1810
01:25:55,973 --> 01:25:57,332
And pointy
steel helmets,

1811
01:25:57,412 --> 01:26:00,209
and they keep
jumping up and down, up and down.

1812
01:26:00,289 --> 01:26:03,084
How long has
this been going on?

1813
01:26:03,164 --> 01:26:04,523
Hardly ever,
except after meals.

1814
01:26:04,603 --> 01:26:05,681
Welcome to my club.

1815
01:26:05,761 --> 01:26:08,078
I think
you have an ulcer.

1816
01:26:08,157 --> 01:26:09,516
An ulcer? Me?
From what?

1817
01:26:09,596 --> 01:26:10,794
Too many
spicy foods.

1818
01:26:10,874 --> 01:26:12,233
You'll have
to get used

1819
01:26:12,313 --> 01:26:14,150
to taking
little pink pills.

1820
01:26:14,230 --> 01:26:15,588
Oh, I'd rather die,

1821
01:26:15,668 --> 01:26:18,464
but first I must get
rid of this headache.

1822
01:26:18,544 --> 01:26:20,701
Do you have
about 300 aspirins?

1823
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:23,817
I'm not as young
as I think I am.

1824
01:26:23,897 --> 01:26:25,255
Why do you say that?

1825
01:26:25,335 --> 01:26:26,614
Isn't it obvious?

1826
01:26:26,694 --> 01:26:29,969
Last night, I couldn't
carry you up the stairs.

1827
01:26:30,049 --> 01:26:32,367
I can't eat
rich food anymore.

1828
01:26:32,446 --> 01:26:34,244
I dye my hair, my...

1829
01:26:34,324 --> 01:26:35,682
Well, it's very nice.

1830
01:26:35,762 --> 01:26:36,641
Thank you.

1831
01:26:36,721 --> 01:26:38,078
So are you.

1832
01:26:38,158 --> 01:26:42,074
You know, Ethel, you are
a very unusual woman.

1833
01:26:42,153 --> 01:26:43,352
Unusual? In what way?

1834
01:26:43,432 --> 01:26:45,589
I took a long look
at you last night.

1835
01:26:45,669 --> 01:26:47,506
Do you know
what you are?

1836
01:26:47,586 --> 01:26:48,465
What?

1837
01:26:48,545 --> 01:26:49,424
A good sport.

1838
01:26:49,503 --> 01:26:50,542
Oh, a good sport.

1839
01:26:50,622 --> 01:26:53,898
To have gone through
all you did last night...

1840
01:26:53,978 --> 01:26:55,336
the trip to Staten Island,
the strange food,

1841
01:26:55,416 --> 01:26:59,650
being carried up
to my apartment like that.

1842
01:26:59,730 --> 01:27:01,089
If you remember, eh?

1843
01:27:01,169 --> 01:27:02,766
Ha ha ha!

1844
01:27:05,962 --> 01:27:09,077
Mr. Velasco,
where are my clothes?

1845
01:27:09,157 --> 01:27:11,954
Oh, your clothes. Here.

1846
01:27:12,034 --> 01:27:14,830
I'm sure I wore
more than that.

1847
01:27:14,910 --> 01:27:16,548
It's a cleaning ticket.

1848
01:27:16,628 --> 01:27:18,945
They're sending them up
at 4:00.

1849
01:27:19,024 --> 01:27:20,863
Oh, they're
at the cleaners.

1850
01:27:20,943 --> 01:27:22,700
When did I
take them off?

1851
01:27:22,740 --> 01:27:25,497
You didn't. You were
drenched and out cold.

1852
01:27:25,577 --> 01:27:27,174
Gonzales took them off.

1853
01:27:27,214 --> 01:27:28,213
Mr. Gonzales?

1854
01:27:28,293 --> 01:27:29,651
Not Mister... Dr. Gonzales.

1855
01:27:29,731 --> 01:27:31,089
Oh, the doctor.
Dr. Gonzales.

1856
01:27:31,169 --> 01:27:32,527
I guess that's
all right, then.

1857
01:27:32,607 --> 01:27:35,324
How convenient to have
an M.D. In the building.

1858
01:27:35,364 --> 01:27:36,761
He is not an M.D.

1859
01:27:36,801 --> 01:27:39,158
He's a doctor
of philosophy.

1860
01:27:42,754 --> 01:27:44,112
Ha ha ha!

1861
01:27:44,192 --> 01:27:45,071
Here. Aspirin.

1862
01:27:45,151 --> 01:27:46,509
No, thank you.

1863
01:27:46,589 --> 01:27:47,947
I'm feeling
much better now.

1864
01:27:48,027 --> 01:27:49,385
I'll take them.

1865
01:27:49,465 --> 01:27:50,823
Well, I must go.

1866
01:27:50,903 --> 01:27:53,699
Someone is calling
about renting my apartment.

1867
01:27:53,779 --> 01:27:56,616
From now on,
I take elevators.

1868
01:27:56,695 --> 01:27:58,293
Ooh!

1869
01:27:58,373 --> 01:28:00,410
Is there anything
I can do for you?

1870
01:28:01,489 --> 01:28:02,847
Yes, there is.

1871
01:28:02,927 --> 01:28:05,803
Would you like to have
dinner with me tonight?

1872
01:28:05,883 --> 01:28:06,642
Me?

1873
01:28:06,722 --> 01:28:09,039
If you don't mind
eating plain food.

1874
01:28:09,119 --> 01:28:11,876
I love plain food.

1875
01:28:11,956 --> 01:28:15,311
Good. I'll call the New York Hospital
for a reservation.

1876
01:28:15,391 --> 01:28:17,069
I'll pick you up at 7:00.

1877
01:28:17,149 --> 01:28:18,946
Whatever you say,
Victor.

1878
01:28:19,026 --> 01:28:20,384
Now, that's funny.

1879
01:28:20,464 --> 01:28:22,941
I was getting
used to Walter.

1880
01:28:24,938 --> 01:28:29,173
You know what I
could use right now?

1881
01:28:29,213 --> 01:28:31,290
A double ouzo.

1882
01:28:34,207 --> 01:28:37,482
What I really could use
is a new outfit.

1883
01:28:37,562 --> 01:28:39,679
Mother,
can I talk to you?

1884
01:28:39,759 --> 01:28:43,514
Do you realize I slept without
a board last night?

1885
01:28:43,594 --> 01:28:45,911
For the first time
in years,

1886
01:28:45,991 --> 01:28:47,349
I slept
without a board!

1887
01:28:47,429 --> 01:28:48,468
You don't suppose

1888
01:28:48,548 --> 01:28:51,823
ouzo is some kind
of Greek miracle drug, do you?

1889
01:28:51,903 --> 01:28:54,699
There's something
I've got to talk to you about.

1890
01:28:54,779 --> 01:28:57,176
How sweet of you.
You're worried about me.

1891
01:28:57,256 --> 01:28:59,053
I'm not worried about you.

1892
01:28:59,093 --> 01:29:00,492
Oh, my hair.

1893
01:29:00,532 --> 01:29:03,448
I wonder what I
could do with my hair?

1894
01:29:03,528 --> 01:29:06,364
Paul and I are
getting a divorce.

1895
01:29:06,443 --> 01:29:08,960
A divorce?

1896
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:09,919
That's right.

1897
01:29:09,999 --> 01:29:13,595
Paul and I
are splitting up for good.

1898
01:29:13,674 --> 01:29:14,673
You and Paul?

1899
01:29:14,753 --> 01:29:15,832
I don't believe you.

1900
01:29:15,912 --> 01:29:17,909
You saw him leave
with his suitcase.

1901
01:29:17,989 --> 01:29:20,746
What did you think
he had in there?

1902
01:29:20,825 --> 01:29:22,663
I know how neat he is.

1903
01:29:22,743 --> 01:29:24,460
I thought
maybe the garbage.

1904
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:28,894
Mother, I believe you.
Why don't you believe me?

1905
01:29:28,974 --> 01:29:30,333
Because
in my entire life,

1906
01:29:30,413 --> 01:29:35,007
I've never seen two people more in love
than you and Paul.

1907
01:29:36,724 --> 01:29:39,521
Well, maybe that
was true yesterday,

1908
01:29:39,601 --> 01:29:42,397
but it sure
isn't true today.

1909
01:29:43,795 --> 01:29:47,670
It couldn't have
been all your fault.

1910
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:51,505
No? Because of me, you were
running around without your clothes

1911
01:29:51,585 --> 01:29:55,339
and Paul is out there
in the streets with a cold,

1912
01:29:55,419 --> 01:29:57,736
looking for a place
to sleep.

1913
01:29:57,816 --> 01:29:59,175
Whose fault is that?

1914
01:29:59,255 --> 01:30:01,092
Yours.

1915
01:30:01,172 --> 01:30:04,448
You want to know something
that may shock you?

1916
01:30:04,528 --> 01:30:06,126
I still love you.

1917
01:30:06,206 --> 01:30:08,043
And Paul loves you, too.

1918
01:30:08,123 --> 01:30:10,679
And I love him.

1919
01:30:10,759 --> 01:30:12,597
I don't know
what he wants.

1920
01:30:12,677 --> 01:30:16,392
I don't know how
to make him happy.

1921
01:30:16,432 --> 01:30:19,269
What am I going
to do, Mother?

1922
01:30:19,309 --> 01:30:22,144
That's the first time
you've asked my advice

1923
01:30:22,184 --> 01:30:23,583
since you were 10.

1924
01:30:27,457 --> 01:30:28,856
It's really very simple.

1925
01:30:28,896 --> 01:30:30,294
All you have to do

1926
01:30:30,334 --> 01:30:35,567
is give up a little bit
of you for him.

1927
01:30:35,607 --> 01:30:37,484
Don't make
everything a game,

1928
01:30:37,524 --> 01:30:40,840
just late at night
in that little room upstairs,

1929
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:42,758
take care of him.

1930
01:30:42,797 --> 01:30:44,675
Make him feel...

1931
01:30:44,715 --> 01:30:45,794
important.

1932
01:30:45,834 --> 01:30:47,711
If you can do that,

1933
01:30:47,751 --> 01:30:50,587
you'll have a happy
and wonderful marriage,

1934
01:30:50,627 --> 01:30:53,464
like 2 out
of every 10 couples.

1935
01:30:53,504 --> 01:30:56,339
You'll be one
of the two, baby.

1936
01:30:58,617 --> 01:31:01,932
Now get out of here
and go find him.

1937
01:31:01,972 --> 01:31:03,690
I've got a date.

1938
01:31:04,849 --> 01:31:08,125
Aunt Harriet isn't going
to believe a word of this.

1939
01:31:08,205 --> 01:31:10,521
If you don't hear
from me tomorrow,

1940
01:31:10,601 --> 01:31:13,796
I'll be in the Nacional Hotel
in Mexico City,

1941
01:31:13,876 --> 01:31:15,715
Room 703.

1942
01:32:20,949 --> 01:32:22,946
Ha ha ha!

1943
01:32:23,026 --> 01:32:24,863
Ha ha ha!

1944
01:32:24,943 --> 01:32:27,100
Ha ha ha!

1945
01:32:31,016 --> 01:32:32,374
Paul!

1946
01:32:32,453 --> 01:32:34,770
It is you!

1947
01:32:34,850 --> 01:32:36,688
I doubt that very much.

1948
01:32:36,768 --> 01:32:39,084
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

1949
01:32:39,164 --> 01:32:40,044
Oh, yeah?

1950
01:32:40,124 --> 01:32:42,440
Oh, well,
you'll never find me.

1951
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:43,878
Ha ha ha!

1952
01:32:43,958 --> 01:32:44,837
Your coat!

1953
01:32:44,917 --> 01:32:46,275
Where's your coat?

1954
01:32:46,355 --> 01:32:48,193
Coat?

1955
01:32:48,273 --> 01:32:51,069
I don't need a coat.

1956
01:32:51,149 --> 01:32:52,907
It's only 2 degrees.

1957
01:32:54,505 --> 01:32:56,342
What have you
been doing?

1958
01:32:56,422 --> 01:32:57,301
Oh.

1959
01:32:57,381 --> 01:33:00,177
Oh. Ha ha ha!

1960
01:33:00,257 --> 01:33:02,095
What have I been doing?

1961
01:33:02,175 --> 01:33:04,492
Just what have I been doing?

1962
01:33:04,571 --> 01:33:08,846
I've been walking
barefoot in the park.

1963
01:33:08,926 --> 01:33:10,484
Paul, you're crazy.

1964
01:33:10,564 --> 01:33:11,682
Shh!

1965
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:15,676
But guess what I am?

1966
01:33:15,756 --> 01:33:17,595
You're drunk.

1967
01:33:17,635 --> 01:33:19,512
Ha ha ha!

1968
01:33:19,552 --> 01:33:21,429
You finally noticed!

1969
01:33:21,509 --> 01:33:22,987
Ha ha ha!

1970
01:33:25,783 --> 01:33:28,260
You're lousy,
stinking drunk.

1971
01:33:30,937 --> 01:33:32,934
Yee eeh!

1972
01:33:33,014 --> 01:33:35,810
Oh, I see you
still have your shoes.

1973
01:33:35,890 --> 01:33:38,487
Boy, what a stuffed shirt.

1974
01:33:42,242 --> 01:33:43,440
Paul, no!

1975
01:33:45,278 --> 01:33:46,796
Paul!

1976
01:33:52,308 --> 01:33:53,867
Paul?

1977
01:33:53,947 --> 01:33:56,264
Paul, are you all right?

1978
01:33:56,344 --> 01:33:58,661
Corie, I got to
tell you something.

1979
01:33:58,741 --> 01:33:59,779
No, later.

1980
01:33:59,859 --> 01:34:02,175
No, now. I got
to tell you now.

1981
01:34:02,255 --> 01:34:04,572
I got all the way
down the stairs,

1982
01:34:04,652 --> 01:34:06,291
suddenly it hit me.

1983
01:34:06,371 --> 01:34:11,084
Suddenly I saw everything clearly
for the first time.

1984
01:34:11,164 --> 01:34:13,961
I said to myself
this is crazy.

1985
01:34:14,041 --> 01:34:15,518
This is crazy.

1986
01:34:15,598 --> 01:34:19,273
It's all wrong
for me to run away like this.

1987
01:34:19,313 --> 01:34:21,670
There's only one
right thing to do.

1988
01:34:21,710 --> 01:34:24,027
Really, Paul? What?

1989
01:34:24,107 --> 01:34:25,505
You get out.

1990
01:34:25,545 --> 01:34:28,382
Ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha ha.

1991
01:34:28,422 --> 01:34:30,139
Ha ha ha ha.

1992
01:34:32,256 --> 01:34:33,774
Ah-choo!

1993
01:34:41,844 --> 01:34:43,521
Why should I get out?

1994
01:34:43,601 --> 01:34:45,958
The lease is in my name.

1995
01:34:49,993 --> 01:34:51,511
I'm going home.

1996
01:34:56,225 --> 01:34:57,863
Drop in anytime.

1997
01:34:59,581 --> 01:35:01,258
You know
my address.

1998
01:35:10,207 --> 01:35:13,802
After all, a man's
home is his castle.

1999
01:35:13,882 --> 01:35:16,199
I'm home, castle.

2000
01:35:16,279 --> 01:35:19,075
Oh! Oh, still here?

2001
01:35:19,155 --> 01:35:21,472
Well, I will...

2002
01:35:21,552 --> 01:35:24,828
I will give you
10 minutes

2003
01:35:24,908 --> 01:35:27,703
to pack up
your pelmenchki

2004
01:35:27,783 --> 01:35:29,621
and go.

2005
01:35:29,701 --> 01:35:31,539
Ah-choo!

2006
01:35:31,619 --> 01:35:33,936
Paul, you're burning up
with a fever.

2007
01:35:34,016 --> 01:35:35,373
How about that?

2008
01:35:35,453 --> 01:35:36,812
You're going
to get pneumonia.

2009
01:35:36,892 --> 01:35:39,687
If that's what you want,
that's what I'll get.

2010
01:35:39,767 --> 01:35:42,724
Paul, take your shoes off.
They're soaking wet.

2011
01:35:42,804 --> 01:35:44,641
I can't. My feet
have swellened.

2012
01:35:44,721 --> 01:35:47,038
I never should
have let you out.

2013
01:35:47,118 --> 01:35:48,476
I've got an idea.

2014
01:35:48,556 --> 01:35:50,873
Let's do that thing
you said before.

2015
01:35:50,953 --> 01:35:52,311
Let's wake the police

2016
01:35:52,391 --> 01:35:54,189
and see if they come out
of the crazy neighbors.

2017
01:35:54,269 --> 01:35:56,107
This building
is under arrest!

2018
01:35:56,187 --> 01:35:57,424
Everybody out!

2019
01:35:57,504 --> 01:35:58,543
- What?
- Paul...

2020
01:35:58,623 --> 01:35:59,981
Will you
get into bed?

2021
01:36:00,061 --> 01:36:01,380
You get in first.

2022
01:36:01,420 --> 01:36:02,818
- You're sick.
- Not that sick.

2023
01:36:02,857 --> 01:36:04,735
No, stop it!

2024
01:36:04,775 --> 01:36:06,094
Stop it.

2025
01:36:06,173 --> 01:36:08,171
I mean it. Stop it.

2026
01:36:10,847 --> 01:36:12,245
Ha! Come here, cutie.

2027
01:36:12,285 --> 01:36:14,162
Come on, Paul,
stop it.

2028
01:36:14,202 --> 01:36:16,081
No! I'm
warning you.

2029
01:36:16,121 --> 01:36:18,477
Hey, you're pretty when
you're mean and rotten.

2030
01:36:18,517 --> 01:36:20,395
Keep away from me!
I'll scream!

2031
01:36:20,435 --> 01:36:22,312
Shh! There's snow
on the roof.

2032
01:36:22,352 --> 01:36:23,750
We'll have
an avalanche.

2033
01:36:23,790 --> 01:36:27,106
You're not supposed
to be walking around. You got a fever.

2034
01:36:27,146 --> 01:36:29,023
Stand still,
the both of you.

2035
01:36:37,372 --> 01:36:38,770
Hey...

2036
01:36:38,810 --> 01:36:40,209
Open this door.

2037
01:36:40,249 --> 01:36:41,646
I can't.
I'm scared.

2038
01:36:41,686 --> 01:36:42,765
Of me?

2039
01:36:42,805 --> 01:36:43,724
Yes.

2040
01:36:43,764 --> 01:36:44,843
Why?

2041
01:36:44,883 --> 01:36:46,280
It's not you
anymore.

2042
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:48,677
I want the old
Paul back.

2043
01:36:48,717 --> 01:36:51,074
That fuddy-duddy?

2044
01:36:51,114 --> 01:36:53,471
He's not a fuddy-duddy.
He's strong and dependable.

2045
01:36:53,511 --> 01:36:54,909
He takes care of me

2046
01:36:54,949 --> 01:36:56,667
and protects me
from people like you.

2047
01:36:56,707 --> 01:36:59,943
I want him to know
how much I love him.

2048
01:37:00,023 --> 01:37:02,978
I'll make everything
exactly the way he wants it.

2049
01:37:03,058 --> 01:37:05,375
I'll fix the hole
in the skylight

2050
01:37:05,455 --> 01:37:07,293
and the leak
in the closet.

2051
01:37:07,373 --> 01:37:09,211
I'll put in a bathtub.

2052
01:37:09,290 --> 01:37:11,128
I'll carry him upstairs
every night,

2053
01:37:11,208 --> 01:37:13,525
'cause that's
how much I love him.

2054
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:19,038
Paul?

2055
01:37:23,192 --> 01:37:24,311
Paul?

2056
01:37:27,866 --> 01:37:29,065
Hey...

2057
01:37:32,460 --> 01:37:33,738
Paul?

2058
01:37:37,573 --> 01:37:38,692
Paul!

2059
01:37:38,732 --> 01:37:40,449
Aah!

2060
01:37:40,489 --> 01:37:43,446
You're going
to kill yourself! Come down!

2061
01:37:43,526 --> 01:37:46,322
No, I want to be a nut,

2062
01:37:46,402 --> 01:37:49,197
just like everybody else
in this building!

2063
01:37:49,277 --> 01:37:50,436
Aah!

2064
01:37:50,516 --> 01:37:54,471
No, I don't want you
to be a nut. Come down.

2065
01:37:54,551 --> 01:37:56,309
No.

2066
01:37:56,389 --> 01:37:58,706
Not until you've
said it again,

2067
01:37:58,786 --> 01:38:01,381
loud and clear.

2068
01:38:01,421 --> 01:38:02,780
Anything, Paul,
anything.

2069
01:38:02,860 --> 01:38:05,057
My husband...

2070
01:38:05,137 --> 01:38:06,575
My husband...

2071
01:38:06,655 --> 01:38:08,013
Ah-choo!

2072
01:38:08,093 --> 01:38:09,851
Paul Bratter...

2073
01:38:09,891 --> 01:38:11,289
Paul Bratter...

2074
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:13,805
rising young attorney...

2075
01:38:13,885 --> 01:38:16,722
Aah!
Rising young...

2076
01:38:16,802 --> 01:38:19,078
rising young attorney...

2077
01:38:21,116 --> 01:38:24,312
is a lousy,
stinking drunk.

2078
01:38:24,392 --> 01:38:26,709
Is a lousy,
stinking drunk,

2079
01:38:26,789 --> 01:38:28,546
and I love him.

2080
01:38:30,224 --> 01:38:32,541
I love you,
too, Corie.

2081
01:38:32,621 --> 01:38:36,016
Even when I didn't like you,
I loved you.

2082
01:38:36,096 --> 01:38:38,613
Then, Paul, would
you please come down?

2083
01:38:43,167 --> 01:38:45,085
I can't, not now.

2084
01:38:45,165 --> 01:38:46,083
Why?

2085
01:38:46,163 --> 01:38:48,160
'Cause I'm
going to be sick.

2086
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:49,239
Oh, no!

2087
01:38:49,319 --> 01:38:50,437
Oh, yes.

2088
01:38:50,477 --> 01:38:53,793
Don't move. I'll be right up
there to get you.

2089
01:38:53,833 --> 01:38:57,309
Would you do that,
'cause I'm getting panicky.

2090
01:38:57,389 --> 01:38:59,226
Paul, I'm coming.
I'm coming.

2091
01:39:00,704 --> 01:39:02,063
Corie? Cor-Corie?

2092
01:39:02,143 --> 01:39:03,341
Corie!

2093
01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:04,819
What? What, Paul, what?

2094
01:39:04,898 --> 01:39:06,736
Don't leave me.

2095
01:39:06,816 --> 01:39:08,654
You're going
to be all right.

2096
01:39:08,734 --> 01:39:10,891
Just hold on tight
and be calm.

2097
01:39:10,971 --> 01:39:13,887
How?
Wh-what should I do?

2098
01:39:13,967 --> 01:39:15,804
What should he do?

2099
01:39:15,884 --> 01:39:18,041
What should he do?
Sing.

2100
01:39:18,121 --> 01:39:19,519
Sing?

2101
01:39:19,559 --> 01:39:21,437
Sing as
loud as you can.

2102
01:39:21,477 --> 01:39:23,914
Don't stop till I get there.
Promise you'll keep singing.

2103
01:39:23,994 --> 01:39:25,751
I promise.

2104
01:39:25,791 --> 01:39:28,148
O.K., don't stop
until I get there.

2105
01:39:28,188 --> 01:39:30,385
I love you, darling.
Keep singing.

2106
01:39:30,465 --> 01:39:31,823
Corie? Corie, Corie!

2107
01:39:31,903 --> 01:39:32,782
Corie!

2108
01:39:32,862 --> 01:39:33,981
What, Paul?

2109
01:39:34,061 --> 01:39:35,938
What song should I sing?

2110
01:39:37,336 --> 01:39:38,695
Shama shama.

2111
01:39:38,735 --> 01:39:40,212
Sh...

2112
01:39:40,292 --> 01:39:41,490
Shama?

2113
01:39:41,570 --> 01:39:43,889
Sing it, Paul.

What's happening?

2131
01:40:17,028 --> 01:40:18,386
I don't know.

2132
01:40:18,466 --> 01:40:20,426
They're looking up
at this house.
