{1153}{1227}Once upon a time|in a far away land...
{1233}{1324}a young prince|lived in a shining castle.
{1330}{1402}Although he had everything|his heart desired...
{1408}{1539}the prince was spoiled,|selfish and unkind.
{1545}{1594}But then,|one winter's night...
{1600}{1659}an old beggar woman|came to the castle...
{1665}{1731}and offered him|a single rose...
{1737}{1814}in return for shelter|from the bitter cold.
{1820}{1874}Repulsed by her|haggard appearance...
{1880}{1994}the prince sneered at the gift|and turned the old woman away.
{2000}{2079}But she warned him not to be|deceived by appearances...
{2085}{2157}for beauty is found within.
{2163}{2275}And when he dismissed her again,|the old woman's ugliness melted away...
{2281}{2371}to reveal|a beautiful enchantress.
{2377}{2445}The prince tried to apologize,|but it was too late...
{2451}{2535}for she had seen that|there was no love in his heart.
{2541}{2624}And as punishment, she transformed him|into a hideous beast...
{2630}{2760}and placed a powerful spell|on the castle and all who lived there.
{2766}{2822}Ashamed of|his monstrous form...
{2828}{2896}the beast concealed himself|inside his castle...
{2902}{3031}with a magic mirror as|his only window to the outside world.
{3037}{3088}The rose she had offered...
{3094}{3150}was truly an enchanted rose...
{3156}{3238}which would bloom|until his 21st year.
{3244}{3305}If he could learn|to love another...
{3311}{3428}and earn her love in return|by the time the last petal fell...
{3434}{3509}then the spell|would be broken.
{3515}{3575}If not,|he would be doomed...
{3581}{3685}to remain a beast|for all time.
{3691}{3737}As the years passed...
{3743}{3870}he fell into despair|and lost all hope...
{3876}{4011}for who could ever learn|to love a beast?
{4609}{4733}{y:i}Little town|{y:i}It's a quiet village
{4739}{4852}{y:i}Every day|{y:i}like the one before
{4858}{4959}{y:i}Little town|{y:i}full of little people
{4965}{5127}{y:i}Waking up to say
{5187}{5274}{y:i}There goes the baker|{y:i}with his tray like always
{5280}{5352}{y:i}The same old|{y:i}bread and rolls to sell
{5358}{5400}{y:i}Every morning|{y:i}just the same
{5406}{5443}{y:i}Since the morning|{y:i}that we came
{5449}{5506}{y:i}- To this poor provincial town|- Good morning, Belle.
{5512}{5553}- Morning, monsieur.|- Where you off to?
{5559}{5631}The bookshop. I just finished|the most wonderful story...
{5637}{5692}- about a beanstalk and an ogre and...|- That's nice.
{5698}{5773}Marie, the baguettes!|Hurry up!
{5779}{5857}{y:i}Look, there she goes|{y:i}The girl is strange, no question
{5863}{5940}{y:i}Dazed and distracted|{y:i}Can't you tell
{5946}{6029}{y:i}- Never part of any crowd|{y:i}- 'Cause her head's up on some cloud
{6035}{6132}{y:i}No denying she's a funny girl|{y:i}that Belle
{6138}{6180}- Bonjour|{y:i}- Good day
{6186}{6221}{y:i}How is your family
{6227}{6272}- Bonjour|{y:i}- Good day
{6278}{6313}{y:i}How is your wife
{6319}{6397}{y:i}- I need six eggs|{y:i}- That's too expensive
{6403}{6498}{y:i}There must be more|{y:i}than this provincial life
{6504}{6557}- Ah, Belle!|- Good morning.
{6563}{6628}- I've come to return|the book I borrowed.|- Finished already?
{6634}{6692}Oh, I couldn't put it down.|Have you got anything new?
{6698}{6737}Not since yesterday.
{6743}{6820}That's all right.|I'll borrow this one.
{6826}{6881}That one?|But you've read it twice!
{6887}{6934}Well, it's my favourite!|Far-off places...
{6940}{7012}daring sword fights, magic spells,|a prince in disguise.
{7018}{7090}If you like it all that much,|it's yours.
{7096}{7131}- But, sir!|- I insist.
{7137}{7207}Well, thank you.|Thank you very much.
{7213}{7296}{y:i}Look, there she goes|{y:i}That girl is so peculiar
{7302}{7376}{y:i}I wonder if|{y:i}she's feeling well
{7382}{7460}{y:i}- With a dreamy, far-off look|{y:i}- And her nose stuck in a book
{7466}{7559}{y:i}What a puzzle|{y:i}to the rest of us is Belle
{7565}{7621}{y:i}Oh
{7627}{7708}{y:i}Isn't this amazing
{7714}{7770}{y:i}It's my favourite part
{7776}{7931}{y:i}Because you'll see
{7937}{8079}{y:i}Here's where|{y:i}she meets Prince Charming
{8085}{8179}{y:i}But she won't|{y:i}discover that it's him
{8185}{8262}{y:i}Till chapter three
{8268}{8301}Hey-hey!|Hey-hey-hey!
{8307}{8394}{y:i}Now it's no wonder|{y:i}that her name means beauty
{8400}{8471}{y:i}Her looks have got|{y:i}no parallel
{8477}{8561}{y:i}But behind that fair facade|{y:i}I'm afraid she's rather odd
{8567}{8607}{y:i}Very different|{y:i}from the rest of us
{8613}{8651}{y:i}She's nothing like the rest of us
{8657}{8787}{y:i}Yes, different from the rest of us|{y:i}is Belle
{8890}{8935}Wow! You didn't|miss a shot, Gaston!
{8941}{9004}- You're the greatest hunter|in the whole world!|- I know.
{9010}{9065}No beast alive stands|a chance against you...
{9071}{9136}- and no girl, for that matter.|- It's true, Lefou.
{9142}{9197}And I've got my sights|set on that one.
{9203}{9256}- The inventor's daughter?|- She's the one!
{9262}{9311}- The lucky girl I'm going to marry.|- But she...
{9317}{9365}- The most beautiful girl in town.|- I know, but...
{9371}{9424}That makes her the best!
{9430}{9516}- And don't I deserve the best?|- Well, of course! I mean, you do!
{9522}{9597}{y:i}Right from the moment|{y:i}when I met her, saw her
{9603}{9611}{y:i}Right from the moment|{y:i}when I met her, saw her
{9617}{9691}{y:i}I said she's gorgeous|{y:i}and I fell
{9697}{9740}{y:i}Here in town|{y:i}there's only she
{9746}{9784}{y:i}Who is beautiful as me
{9790}{9883}{y:i}So I'm making plans|{y:i}to woo and marry Belle
{9889}{9978}{y:i}Look, there he goes|{y:i}Isn't he dreamy
{9984}{10055}{y:i}Monsieur Gaston|{y:i}Oh, he's so cute
{10061}{10142}{y:i}Be still my heart|{y:i}I'm hardly breathing
{10148}{10251}{y:i}He's such a tall, dark, strong|{y:i}and handsome brute
{10257}{10280}- Bonjour|{y:i}- Good day
{10286}{10330}{y:i}- You call this bacon|{y:i}- What lovely grapes
{10336}{10361}{y:i}- Some cheese|{y:i}- Ten yards
{10367}{10415}{y:i}- Excuse me|{y:i}- I'll get the knife|{y:i}- Please let me through
{10421}{10494}{y:i}- This bread, it's stale|{y:i}- Those fish, they smell|{y:i}- Madame's mistaken
{10500}{10586}{y:i}There must be more than|{y:i}this provincial life
{10592}{10687}{y:i}Just watch, I'm going|{y:i}to make Belle my wife
{10693}{10766}{y:i}Look, there she goes, a girl|{y:i}who's strange but special
{10772}{10846}{y:i}A most peculiar|{y:i}mademoiselle
{10852}{10930}{y:i}It's a pity and a sin|{y:i}She doesn't quite fit in
{10936}{10988}{y:i}'Cause she really is|{y:i}a funny girl
{10994}{11148}{y:i}A beauty but a funny girl|{y:i}She really is a funny girl
{11154}{11289}{y:i}That Belle
{11372}{11441}- Hello, Belle.|- "Bonjour", Gaston.
{11447}{11491}Gaston, may I have|my book, please?
{11497}{11554}How can you read this?|There's no pictures!
{11560}{11611}Well, some people|use their imagination.
{11617}{11676}Belle, it's about time you got|your head out of those books...
{11682}{11742}and paid attention|to more important things.
{11748}{11816}Like me.
{11822}{11874}The whole town's|talking about it.
{11880}{11924}It's not right|for a woman to read.
{11930}{11991}Soon she starts|getting ideas and thinking.
{11997}{12093}- Gaston, you are positively primeval.|- Why, thank you, Belle.
{12099}{12149}What do you say you and me|take a walk over to the tavern...
{12155}{12223}- and take a look at my trophies?|- Maybe some other time.
{12229}{12307}- What's wrong with her?|- She's crazy.|- He's gorgeous!
{12313}{12395}Please, Gaston, I can't.|I have to get home to help my father.
{12401}{12434}Goodbye.
{12440}{12527}That crazy old loon!|He needs all the help he can get.
{12533}{12578}Don't talk about|my father that way!
{12584}{12642}Yeah! Don't talk about|her father that way!
{12648}{12741}My father is not crazy.|He's a genius!
{13037}{13130}- Papa?|- How on earth did that happen?
{13136}{13196}- Doggone it!|- Are you all right, Papa?
{13202}{13302}I-I'm a... I'm about ready|to give up on this hunk of junk.
{13308}{13378}- You always say that.|- I mean it this time!
{13384}{13450}I'll never get this|boneheaded contraption to work!
{13456}{13532}Yes, you will, and you'll win|first prize at the fair tomorrow.
{13538}{13632}- Hmph!|- And become a world-famous inventor.
{13638}{13723}- You really believe that?|- I always have.
{13729}{13829}Well, what are we waitin' for?|I'll have this thing fixed in no time.
{13835}{13907}Hand me that... the... the...|the dog-legged clincher there.
{13913}{13977}So, did you have a good time|in town today?
{13983}{14034}I got a new book.
{14040}{14107}Papa, do you think I'm odd?
{14113}{14158}My daughter? Odd?
{14164}{14208}Where would you get|an idea like that?
{14214}{14314}Oh, I don't know. It's just that|I'm not sure I fit in here.
{14320}{14364}There's no one I can really talk to.
{14370}{14450}What about that Gaston?|H-He's a handsome fella.
{14456}{14541}He's handsome, all right,|and rude and conceited and...
{14547}{14639}- Oh, Papa, he's not for me.|- Well, don't you worry...
{14645}{14733}'cause this invention's gonna be|the start of a new life for us.
{14739}{14846}I think that's done it.|Now, let's give it a try.
{15154}{15237}- It works!|- It does?
{15243}{15288}- It does!|- You did it!
{15294}{15336}You really did it!
{15342}{15457}Hitch up Philippe, girl.|I'm off to the fair!
{15465}{15519}Goodbye, Papa.|Good luck!
{15525}{15636}Goodbye, Belle.|Take care while I'm gone.
{16024}{16046}We should be there by now.
{16052}{16072}We should be there by now.
{16078}{16126}Maybe we missed a turn.
{16132}{16248}I guess I should've taken...|Wait a minute.
{16316}{16402}No. Let's go this way.
{16624}{16744}Come on, Philippe, it's a short cut.|We'll be there in no time.
{17184}{17257}This can't be right.|Where have you taken us, Philippe?
{17263}{17358}We better turn around.
{17364}{17494}Whoa. Whoa, boy.|Whoa, now, whoa, Philippe.
{17510}{17565}Oh! Oh!|Look out! No!
{17571}{17627}Oh! Oh!|Look out! No!
{17660}{17772}Whoa!|Whoa, boy!
{17778}{17840}Back up, back up, back up!
{17846}{17931}Good boy! Good boy.|That's good, that's... Back up!
{17937}{17996}Steady, steady, now.|Steady.
{18002}{18105}Steady. No, Philippe!
{18239}{18331}Philippe?
{18333}{18414}Oh.
{18904}{18979}Help!|Is... Is someone there?
{18985}{19058}Help!
{19126}{19205}Oh!
{19679}{19785}Wha... Oh!
{19876}{19961}Hello?
{19978}{20007}Hello!
{20013}{20065}Poor fellow must have|lost his way in the woods.
{20071}{20140}Keep quiet.|Maybe he'll go away.
{20146}{20215}Is someone there?
{20221}{20280}Not a word, Lumiere.|Not one word!
{20286}{20385}I-I don't mean to intrude,|but I've lost my horse...
{20391}{20456}and... and I need a place|to stay for the night.
{20462}{20509}Oh, Cogsworth, have a heart.
{20515}{20567}Shh!
{20573}{20601}O-O-Ow! Ow! Ow!
{20607}{20656}Of course, monsieur,|you are welcome here.
{20662}{20695}Who said that?
{20701}{20743}Over here.
{20749}{20836}- Where?|- Hello.
{20883}{20921}Incredible!
{20927}{20967}Well, now you've done it, Lumiere.
{20973}{21036}Splendid! Just peachy!
{21042}{21119}- How is this accomplished?|- Put me down at once!
{21125}{21224}Stop that! Hee-hee-hee.|Stop that, I say!
{21339}{21394}Sir, close that at once!
{21400}{21453}- Do you mind?|- I-I beg your pardon?
{21459}{21576}It's... It's just that I've|never seen a clock that...
{21742}{21789}Oh, you are soaked|to the bone, monsieur.
{21795}{21841}Come.|Warm yourself by the fire.
{21847}{21924}- Thank you.|- No, no, no!
{21930}{21975}You know what the master will do|if he finds him here.
{21981}{22063}I demand that you stop|right there!
{22069}{22096}Oh, no, no!|Not the master's chair!
{22102}{22184}Oh, no, no!|Not the master's chair!
{22204}{22262}I'm not seeing this!|I'm not seeing this!
{22268}{22393}Well, hello there, boy.
{22456}{22508}- Oh, what service!|- All right!
{22514}{22588}This has gone far enough.|I'm in charge here...
{22594}{22683}Ah, would you like a spot of tea, sir?|It'll warm you up in no time.
{22689}{22804}No! No tea. No tea!
{22827}{22887}His mustache tickles, Mama!
{22893}{23009}Oh! Hello!
{23074}{23150}Uh-oh.
{23325}{23367}There's a stranger here.
{23373}{23446}Master, allow me to explain.|The gentleman was lost in the woods.
{23452}{23543}He was cold and wet, so...
{23565}{23634}Master, I'd like to take|this moment to say...
{23640}{23689}I was against this from the start.|It was all his fault.
{23695}{23807}I tried to stop them.|Would they listen to me? No, no...
{23894}{23944}Who are you?|What are you doing here?
{23950}{24004}I-I-I was lost in the woods and...
{24010}{24104}- You are not welcome here!|- I-I-I'm sorry.
{24110}{24157}- What are you staring at?|- N-Nothing.
{24163}{24247}So, you've come to stare|at the beast, have you?
{24253}{24331}Please, I meant no harm!|I-I just needed a place to stay.
{24337}{24492}- I'll give you a place to stay!|- No, no, please! No! No!
{24573}{24669}Oh, boy. Belle's gonna get|the surprise of her life, huh, Gaston?
{24675}{24780}Yep, this is her lucky day.
{24817}{24887}I'd like to thank you all|for coming to my wedding.
{24893}{25016}First I better go in there|and propose to the girl.
{25030}{25096}And you, Lefou, now, when|Belle and I come out that door...
{25102}{25202}Oh, I know! I know!|I-I strike up the band!
{25258}{25352}- Not yet!|- Sorry.
{25548}{25582}Oh!
{25588}{25664}Gaston,|what a pleasant surprise.
{25670}{25746}Isn't it, though?|I'm just full of surprises.
{25752}{25853}You know, Belle,|there's not a girl in town who|wouldn't love to be in your shoes.
{25859}{25934}This is the day...
{25971}{25984}This is the day|your dreams come true.
{25990}{26027}This is the day|your dreams come true.
{26033}{26098}What do you know|about my dreams, Gaston?
{26104}{26178}Plenty!|Here. Picture this.
{26184}{26304}A rustic hunting lodge,|my latest kill roasting on the fire...
{26310}{26379}and my little wife|massaging my feet...
{26385}{26449}while the little ones|play on the floor with the dogs.
{26455}{26504}- We'll have six or seven.|- Dogs?
{26510}{26543}No, Belle.
{26549}{26605}- Strapping boys like me.|- Imagine that.
{26611}{26672}- Do you know who that|little wife will be?|- Let me think.
{26678}{26725}- You, Belle.|- Gaston, I'm...
{26731}{26786}I'm speechless.
{26792}{26847}I really don't know|what to say.
{26853}{26948}- Say you'll marry me.|- I'm very sorry, Gaston, but...
{26954}{27088}but I just don't deserve you!
{27385}{27444}So, how'd it go?
{27450}{27517}I'll have Belle for my wife.
{27523}{27624}Make no mistake about that.
{27630}{27708}Touchy!
{27837}{27905}Is he gone?
{27911}{27983}Can you imagine?|He asked me to marry him.
{27989}{28089}Me, the wife of that|boorish, brainless...
{28095}{28136}{y:i}Madame Gaston
{28142}{28184}{y:i}Can't you just see it
{28190}{28271}{y:i}Madame Gaston|{y:i}his little wife
{28277}{28361}{y:i}No, sir, not me|{y:i}I guarantee it
{28367}{28455}{y:i}I want much more than|{y:i}this provincial life
{28461}{28523}{y:i}I want much more than|{y:i}this provincial life
{28692}{28808}{y:i}I want adventure|{y:i}in the great wide somewhere
{28814}{28919}{y:i}I want it more|{y:i}than I can tell
{28925}{29001}{y:i}And for once|{y:i}it might be grand
{29007}{29103}{y:i}To have someone understand
{29109}{29306}{y:i}I want so much more|{y:i}than they've got planned
{29311}{29335}Philippe! What are you|doing here? Where's...
{29341}{29400}Philippe! What are you|doing here? Where's...
{29406}{29490}Where's Papa? Where is he, Philippe?|What happened?
{29496}{29611}Oh, we have to find him.|You have to take me to him.
{29912}{29985}What is this place?
{29991}{30084}Philippe, please, steady.
{30085}{30178}Steady.
{30202}{30234}Papa!
{30240}{30304}Couldn't keep quiet,|could we?
{30310}{30366}Just had to invite him to stay,|didn't we?
{30372}{30444}Serve him tea,|sit in the master's chair.
{30450}{30547}- Pet the pooch!|- I was trying to be hospitable.
{30553}{30649}Hello?|Is anyone here?
{30655}{30709}Hello?
{30715}{30791}Papa? Papa?
{30797}{30843}Are you here?
{30849}{30915}Mama, there's a girl|in the castle.
{30921}{30993}Now, Chip, I'll not have you|making up such wild stories.
{30999}{31051}Really, Mama.|I saw her.
{31057}{31103}- Not another word. Into the tub.|- But... What...
{31109}{31194}A girl!|I saw a girl in the castle!
{31200}{31240}See, I told ya!
{31246}{31343}Irresponsible, devil-may-care,|waxy eared, slack-jawed...
{31349}{31406}Papa?
{31412}{31491}Did you see that?
{31497}{31567}- It's a girl!|- I know it's a girl.
{31573}{31647}Don't you see? She's the one!|The girl we have been waiting for!
{31653}{31757}- She has come to break the spell!|- Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
{31809}{31873}Papa?
{31879}{31945}Papa?
{31964}{32024}Hello?|Is someone here?
{32030}{32147}Wait!|I'm looking for my father. L...
{32180}{32290}That's funny.|I'm sure there was someone.
{32296}{32333}I-Is anyone here?
{32339}{32445}- Belle?|- Papa!
{32455}{32530}- H-H-How did you find me?|- Oh, your hands are like ice.
{32536}{32606}- We have to get you out of there.|- Belle, I want you to leave this place.
{32612}{32667}- Who's done this to you?|- No time to explain.
{32673}{32727}- You must go. Now!|- I won't leave you.
{32733}{32778}- What are you doing here?|- Run, Belle!
{32784}{32889}- Who's there? Who are you?|- The master of this castle.
{32895}{32959}I've come for my father.|Please let him out.
{32965}{33041}- Can't you see he's sick?|- Then he shouldn't have trespassed here!
{33047}{33112}But he could die.|Please, I'll do anything.
{33118}{33210}There's nothing you can do.|He's my prisoner.
{33216}{33333}Oh, there must be some way|I can... Wait!
{33441}{33540}- Take me instead.|- You?
{33546}{33615}You would take his place?
{33621}{33670}Belle, no! You don't know|what you're doing!
{33676}{33741}If I did,|would you let him go?
{33747}{33893}Yes, but you must promise|to stay here forever.
{33917}{34021}Come into the light.
{34241}{34373}No, Belle!|I won't let you do this!
{34382}{34477}- You have my word.|- Done!
{34533}{34610}No, Belle, listen to me.|I'm old. I've lived my life.
{34616}{34703}- Wait!|- Belle!|- Wait!
{34703}{34766}No! Please spare my daughter.|Please!
{34772}{34850}She's no longer your concern.|Take him to the village.
{34856}{34914}Let me out.|Please let me out!
{34920}{35057}Let me out!|Please! Please!
{35161}{35188}- Master?|- What?
{35194}{35287}Uh, since the girl is going to be|with us for quite some time...
{35293}{35443}I was thinking that you might want|to offer her a more comfortable room.
{35446}{35520}Then again, maybe not.
{35550}{35609}You didn't even let me|say goodbye.
{35615}{35664}I'll never see him again.
{35670}{35779}- I didn't get to say goodbye.|- I'll show you to your room.
{35785}{35866}My room?|But I thought...
{35872}{35917}- You wanna... You wanna|stay in the tower?|- No.
{35923}{36018}Then follow me.
{36463}{36544}- Say something to her.|- Huh? Oh.
{36550}{36670}I, uh, hope you like it here.
{36689}{36786}The castle is your home now,|so you can go anywhere you like|except the west wing.
{36792}{36895}- What's in the west...|- It's forbidden!
{37023}{37100}Now, if you need anything,|my servants will attend you.
{37106}{37165}Dinner. Invite her to dinner.
{37171}{37305}You will join me for dinner.|That's not a request!
{37709}{37803}Who does she think she is? That girl|has tangled with the wrong man.
{37809}{37877}- No one says no to Gaston!|- Darn right!
{37883}{37982}Dismissed! Rejected!|Publicly humiliated!
{37988}{38027}Why, it's more|than I can bear.
{38033}{38113}- More beer?|- What for? Nothing helps.
{38119}{38202}- I'm disgraced.|- Who, you? Never!
{38208}{38296}Gaston, you've got to|pull yourself together.
{38302}{38373}{y:i}Gosh, it disturbs me|{y:i}to see you, Gaston
{38379}{38446}{y:i}Looking so|{y:i}down in the dumps
{38452}{38523}{y:i}Every guy here'd|{y:i}love to be you, Gaston
{38529}{38602}{y:i}Even when taking|{y:i}your lumps
{38608}{38680}{y:i}There's no man in town|{y:i}as admired as you
{38686}{38764}{y:i}You're everyone's|{y:i}favourite guy
{38770}{38835}{y:i}Everyone's awed|{y:i}and inspired by you
{38841}{38918}{y:i}And it's not very hard
{38924}{39046}{y:i}To see why
{39056}{39124}{y:i}No one's
{39130}{39201}{y:i}Slick as Gaston|{y:i}No one's quick as Gaston
{39207}{39278}{y:i}No one's neck's as|{y:i}incredibly thick as Gaston
{39284}{39372}{y:i}For there's no man in town|{y:i}half as manly
{39378}{39434}{y:i}Perfect|{y:i}A pure paragon
{39440}{39517}{y:i}You can ask any|{y:i}Tom, Dick or Stanley
{39523}{39643}{y:i}And they'll tell you whose team|{y:i}they prefer to be on
{39649}{39721}{y:i}No one's
{39727}{39795}{y:i}Been like Gaston|{y:i}a kingpin like Gaston
{39801}{39870}{y:i}No one's got a swell cleft|{y:i}in his chin like Gaston
{39876}{39962}{y:i}As a specimen|{y:i}yes, I'm intimidating
{39968}{40038}{y:i}My, what a guy|{y:i}that Gaston
{40044}{40119}{y:i}Give 5 hurrahs|{y:i}Give 12 hip-hips
{40125}{40248}{y:i}Gaston is the best|{y:i}and the rest is all drips
{40254}{40324}{y:i}No one
{40330}{40395}{y:i}Fights like Gaston|{y:i}Douses lights like Gaston
{40401}{40474}{y:i}In a wrestling match|{y:i}nobody bites like Gaston
{40480}{40557}{y:i}For there's no one|{y:i}as burly and brawny
{40563}{40635}{y:i}As you see|{y:i}I've got biceps to spare
{40641}{40730}{y:i}- Not a bit of him scraggly or scrawny|- That's right!
{40736}{40809}{y:i}And every last inch of me's|{y:i}covered with hair
{40815}{40877}{y:i}- No one hits like Gaston|{y:i}- Matches wits like Gaston
{40883}{40957}{y:i}In a spitting match|{y:i}nobody spits like Gaston
{40963}{41056}{y:i}I'm especially good at expectorating
{41062}{41126}- Ptooey!|{y:i}- Ten points for Gaston
{41132}{41199}{y:i}When I was a lad|{y:i}I ate four dozen eggs
{41205}{41284}{y:i}Every morning|{y:i}to help me get large
{41290}{41360}{y:i}And now that I'm grown|{y:i}I eat five dozen eggs
{41366}{41504}{y:i}So I'm roughly the size|{y:i}of a barge
{41510}{41588}{y:i}No one
{41594}{41624}{y:i}Shoots like Gaston|{y:i}Makes those beauts like Gaston
{41630}{41667}{y:i}Shoots like Gaston|{y:i}Makes those beauts like Gaston
{41673}{41746}{y:i}Then goes tromping around|{y:i}wearing boots like Gaston
{41752}{41840}{y:i}I use antlers in all|{y:i}of my decorating
{41846}{41901}{y:i}My, what a guy
{41907}{42104}{y:i}Gaston
{42150}{42214}- Help! Someone help me!|- Maurice?
{42220}{42269}Please! Please, I need your help.
{42275}{42329}He's got her... He's got her|locked in the dungeon!
{42335}{42380}- Who?|- Belle. We must go.
{42386}{42425}Not... Not a minute to lose.
{42431}{42481}Whoa! Slow down, Maurice.
{42487}{42531}Who's got Belle|locked in a dungeon?
{42537}{42668}A beast!|A horrible, monstrous beast!
{42757}{42791}- Is it a big beast?|- Huge!
{42797}{42869}- With a long, ugly snout?|- Hideously ugly!
{42875}{42961}- And sharp, cruel fangs?|- Yes, yes! Will you help me?
{42967}{43018}All right, old man.|We'll help you out.
{43024}{43065}You will? Oh, thank you,|thank you, thank you!
{43071}{43153}You will? Oh, thank you,|thank you, thank you!
{43166}{43221}Crazy old Maurice.
{43227}{43310}He's always good|for a laugh.
{43316}{43407}Crazy old Maurice, hmm?
{43413}{43486}Crazy old Maurice. Hmm.
{43492}{43576}{y:i}Lefou, I'm afraid|{y:i}I've been thinking
{43582}{43656}{y:i}- A dangerous pastime|{y:i}- I know
{43662}{43729}{y:i}But that wacky old coot|{y:i}is Belle's father
{43735}{43804}{y:i}And his sanity's|{y:i}only so-so
{43810}{43885}{y:i}Now, the wheels in my head|{y:i}have been turning
{43891}{43960}{y:i}Since I looked at|{y:i}that loony old man
{43966}{44001}{y:i}See, I promised myself|{y:i}I'd be married to Belle
{44007}{44045}{y:i}See, I promised myself|{y:i}I'd be married to Belle
{44051}{44149}{y:i}And right now|{y:i}I'm evolving a plan
{44155}{44208}- If I...|- Yes?
{44214}{44282}- Then we...|- No, would she?
{44288}{44321}- Guess!|- Now I get it!
{44327}{44377}- Let's go!|- Let's go!
{44383}{44444}{y:i}No one
{44450}{44519}{y:i}Plots like Gaston|{y:i}Takes cheap shots like Gaston
{44525}{44597}{y:i}Plans to persecute harmless|{y:i}crackpots like Gaston
{44603}{44735}{y:i}So his marriage|{y:i}we soon will be celebrating
{44741}{44792}{y:i}My, what a guy
{44798}{44935}{y:i}Gaston
{44980}{45098}Will no one help me?
{45255}{45348}- Who is it?|- Mrs Potts, dear.
{45359}{45405}I thought you might like|a spot of tea.
{45411}{45459}But you're...|You're a...
{45465}{45547}- Oh! Careful.|- This is impossible!
{45553}{45613}I know it is,|but here we are.
{45619}{45681}I told you she was pretty, Mama,|didn't I?
{45687}{45761}All right, Chip, now, that'll do.|Slowly now.
{45767}{45851}- Don't spill.|- Thank you.
{45857}{45943}Wanna see me|do a trick?
{45943}{46010}- Chip!|- Oops, sorry.
{46016}{46072}That was a very brave thing|you did, my dear.
{46078}{46151}- We all think so.|- But I've lost my father...
{46157}{46199}my dreams, everything.
{46205}{46319}Cheer up, child.|It'll turn out all right in the end.
{46325}{46377}You'll see.|Oh, listen to me...
{46383}{46439}jabberin' on while there's|a supper to get on the table.
{46445}{46519}- Chip?|- Bye!
{46525}{46586}Well, now, what shall we|dress you in for dinner?
{46592}{46651}Oh, let's see what I got|in my drawers.
{46657}{46744}Oh, how embarrassing!
{46750}{46809}Ahem.|Ah, here we are!
{46815}{46857}You'll look ravishing|in this one!
{46863}{46942}That's very kind of you,|but I'm not going to dinner.
{46948}{47006}Ah, but you must!
{47012}{47065}Ahem, ahem, ahem, ahem, ahem.
{47071}{47176}Dinner is served.
{47191}{47271}What's taking so long?|I told her to come down.
{47277}{47359}- Why isn't she here yet?|- Oh, try to be patient, sir.
{47365}{47442}The girl has lost her father|and her freedom all in one day.
{47448}{47492}Master, have you thought|that perhaps...
{47498}{47547}this girl could be the one|to break the spell?
{47553}{47615}Of course I have!|I'm not a fool.
{47621}{47684}Good!|So, you fall in love with her...
{47690}{47744}she falls in love with you,|and poof!
{47750}{47818}The spell is broken.|We'll be human again by midnight.
{47824}{47891}Oh, it's not that easy, Lumiere.|These things take time.
{47897}{47943}But the rose has already|begun to wilt.
{47949}{48001}Oh, it's no use.
{48007}{48129}She's so beautiful and I'm...|Well, look at me!
{48154}{48215}Oh, you must help her|to see past all that.
{48221}{48267}I don't know how.
{48273}{48334}Well, you can start by|making yourself more presentable.
{48340}{48383}Straighten up.|Try to act like a gentleman.
{48389}{48485}Ah, yes. When she comes in,|give her a dashing, debonair smile.
{48491}{48548}Come, come.|Show me the smile.
{48554}{48641}- But don't frighten the poor girl.|- Impress her with your rapier wit.
{48647}{48677}But be gentle.
{48683}{48726}- Shower her with compliments.|- But be sincere.
{48732}{48835}And above all,|you must control your temper!
{48841}{48921}Here she is!
{48926}{48973}Good evening.
{48979}{49023}Well, where is she?
{49029}{49137}Who? Oh, ha ha ha!|The girl, yes. The girl.
{49143}{49233}Well, actually,|she's in the process of...
{49239}{49284}Circumstances|being what they are...
{49290}{49367}Uh, she's not coming.
{49373}{49408}What!
{49414}{49487}Oh, dear. Your Grace!|Your Eminence!
{49493}{49572}Let's not be hasty!
{49604}{49688}- I thought I told you|to come down to dinner!|- I'm not hungry.
{49694}{49772}You'll come out or I'll... I'll...|I'll break down the door!
{49778}{49869}Master, I could be wrong,|but that may not be...
{49875}{49926}the best way to win|the girl's affections.
{49932}{50012}Please attempt|to be a gentleman.
{50018}{50080}But she is being so difficult.
{50086}{50185}Gently, gently.
{50191}{50268}- Will you come down to dinner?|- No!
{50274}{50327}Suave, genteel.
{50333}{50426}It would give me|great pleasure...
{50432}{50476}if you would|join me for dinner.
{50482}{50525}And we say please.
{50531}{50562}- Please.|- No, thank you.
{50568}{50616}- You can't stay in there forever!|- Yes, I can.
{50622}{50729}Fine! Then go ahead|and starve!
{50735}{50905}If she doesn't eat with me,|then she doesn't eat at all!
{50930}{50989}Oh, dear. That didn't|go very well at all, did it?
{50995}{51068}Lumiere, stand watch|at the door...
{51074}{51144}and inform me at once|if there is the slightest change.
{51150}{51203}You can count on me,|{y:i}mon capitaine.
{51209}{51348}Well, we might as well|go downstairs and start cleaning up.
{51354}{51409}I ask nicely, but she refuses.
{51415}{51497}Wh-Wh-What...|What does she want me to do, beg?
{51503}{51593}Show me the girl.
{51599}{51683}{y:i}But the master's really not so bad|{y:i}once you get to know him.
{51689}{51776}{y:i}- Why don't you give him a chance?|{y:i}- I don't want to get to know him.
{51782}{51791}{y:i}I don't want to have|{y:i}anything to do with him.
{51797}{51885}{y:i}I don't want to have|{y:i}anything to do with him.
{51896}{51940}I'm just fooling myself.
{51946}{51999}She'll never see me|as anything...
{52005}{52104}but a monster.
{52178}{52263}It's hopeless.
{52645}{52687}- Oh, no.|- Oh, yes.
{52693}{52753}- Oh, no.|- Oh, yes, yes, yes!
{52759}{52859}I've been burnt by you before.
{52889}{52975}{y:i}Zut alors!|She has emerged!
{53048}{53165}Come on, Chip. Into the cupboard|with your brothers and sisters.
{53170}{53206}But I'm not sleepy.
{53212}{53284}- Yes, you are.|- No, I'm not.
{53290}{53363}I work and I slave all day long,|and for what?
{53369}{53438}A culinary masterpiece|gone to waste!
{53444}{53517}Oh, stop your grousing.|It's been a long night for all of us.
{53523}{53593}Well, if you ask me,|she was just being stubborn!
{53599}{53635}After all, he did say please.
{53641}{53719}But if the master|doesn't learn to control that temper,|he'll never break the...
{53725}{53801}Splendid to see you|out and about, mademoiselle.
{53807}{53924}I am Cogsworth,|head of the household.
{53925}{53995}- This is Lumiere.|{y:i}- Enchanté, chérie.
{54001}{54086}If there's... stop that...|anything we... please... can do...
{54092}{54153}to make your stay|more comfortable...
{54159}{54210}- I am a little hungry.|- You are?
{54216}{54251}Hear that?|She's hungry!
{54257}{54328}Stoke the fire. Break out the silver.|Wake the china.
{54334}{54388}Remember what|the master said.
{54394}{54468}Oh, pish tosh! I'm not about|to let the poor child go hungry.
{54474}{54541}All right, fine. Glass of water,|crust of bread and then...
{54547}{54606}Cogsworth,|I am surprised at you!
{54612}{54665}She's not a prisoner.|She's our guest!
{54671}{54758}We must make her feel welcome here.|Right this way, mademoiselle.
{54764}{54804}Well, keep it down.
{54810}{54863}If the master finds out about this,|it will be our necks.
{54869}{54915}Of course, of course.
{54921}{54999}But what is dinner|without a little music?
{55005}{55074}Music?
{55128}{55207}It is with deepest pride|and greatest pleasure...
{55213}{55253}that we welcome you tonight.
{55259}{55283}And now|we invite you to relax.
{55289}{55317}And now|we invite you to relax.
{55323}{55436}Let us pull up a chair|as the dining room proudly presents...
{55442}{55502}your dinner.

{55600}{55676}{y:i}Be our guest|{y:i}Put our service to the test
{55682}{55790}{y:i}Tie your napkin 'round your neck, chérie|{y:i}and we provide the rest
{55796}{55847}{y:i}Soup du jour|{y:i}Hot hors d'oeuvres
{55853}{55901}{y:i}Why, we only live to serve
{55907}{55956}{y:i}Try the grey stuff|{y:i}It's delicious
{55962}{56011}{y:i}Don't believe me|{y:i}Ask the dishes
{56017}{56066}{y:i}They can sing|{y:i}They can dance
{56072}{56126}{y:i}After all, miss|{y:i}this is France
{56132}{56218}{y:i}And a dinner here|{y:i}is never second best
{56224}{56278}{y:i}Go on, unfold your menu
{56284}{56355}{y:i}Take a glance and then|{y:i}you'll be our guest

{56863}{56955}{y:i}We tell jokes, I do tricks|{y:i}with my fellow candlesticks

{57644}{57731}{y:i}Ah, those good old days|{y:i}when we were useful
{57737}{57845}- Huh?|{y:i}- Suddenly those good old days are gone
{57851}{57917}- Oh!|{y:i}- Ten years we've been rusting
{57923}{57976}{y:i}Needing so much more|{y:i}than dusting
{57982}{58105}{y:i}Needing exercise|{y:i}A chance to use our skills

{60308}{60415}- Bravo! That was wonderful!|- Thank you.
{60421}{60543}Thank you, mademoiselle.|Good show, wasn't it? Everyone!
{60549}{60652}My goodness, look at the time.|Now it's off to bed, off to bed.
{60658}{60713}Oh, I couldn't possibly|go to bed now.
{60719}{60763}It's my first time|in an enchanted castle.
{60769}{60816}Enchanted!
{60822}{60895}Who said anything about|the castle being enchanted?
{60901}{61020}- It was you, wasn't it?|- I figured it out for myself.
{61037}{61084}I'd like to look around,|if that's all right.
{61090}{61166}- Oh, would you like a tour?|- Wait a second. Wait a second.
{61172}{61224}I'm not sure|that's such a good idea.
{61230}{61353}We can't let her go poking around in|certain places, if you know what I mean.
{61359}{61467}Perhaps you'd like to take me.|I'm sure you know everything|there is to know about the castle.
{61473}{61544}Oh, well! Actually, I...
{61550}{61604}Yes, I do.
{61610}{61693}As you can see,|the pseudo-facade was stripped away...
{61699}{61749}to reveal|the minimalist rococo design.
{61755}{61826}Note the unusual|inverted vaulted ceilings.
{61832}{61909}This is yet another example|of the late neoclassic Baroque period.
{61915}{62044}And, as I always say,|if it's not Baroque, don't fix it.
{62063}{62112}Where was I?
{62118}{62167}As you were!
{62173}{62281}Now, then, if I may draw your attention|to the flying buttresses above the...
{62287}{62358}Uh, mademoiselle?
{62459}{62511}- What's up there?|- Where? There? Oh, nothing.
{62517}{62564}Absolutely nothing of interest|at all in the west wing.
{62570}{62630}Dusty, dull, very boring.
{62636}{62692}Ah, so that's the west wing!
{62698}{62747}Nice going.
{62753}{62808}I wonder what|he's hiding up there.
{62814}{62904}- Hiding? The master is hiding nothing.|- Then it wouldn't be forbidden.
{62910}{63012}That's, uh, uh... Mademoiselle would,|uh, like to, uh, uh, see something else?
{63018}{63078}We have exquisite tapestries|dating all the way back to...
{63084}{63133}- Maybe later.|- Uh, the... the gardens...
{63139}{63185}or, or the...|the library perhaps?
{63191}{63230}You have a library?
{63236}{63282}- Yes! Oh, indeed.|- With books.
{63288}{63350}- Scads of books!|- Mountains of books!
{63356}{63382}- Forests of books!|- Cascades!
{63388}{63414}- Cloudbursts!|- Swamps of books!
{63420}{63484}More books than you'll ever|be able to read in a lifetime.
{63490}{63538}Books on every subject|ever studied...
{63544}{63570}by every author|who ever set pen to paper.
{63576}{63652}By every author|who ever set pen to paper.
{64863}{64944}Oh, oh.
{66014}{66086}- Why did you come here?|- I'm... I'm sorry.
{66092}{66180}- I warned you never to come here!|- I didn't mean any harm.
{66186}{66257}Do you realize|what you could have done?
{66263}{66297}Please! Stop!
{66303}{66406}- Get out!|- No!
{66406}{66520}Get out!
{66763}{66812}- Where are you going?|- Promise or no promise...
{66818}{66860}I can't stay here|another minute.
{66866}{66985}No, wait, please!|Please wait!
{68751}{68828}No!
{70457}{70557}Here, now. Don't do that.
{70611}{70693}Just hold still.
{70699}{70768}- That hurts!|- If you'd hold still,|it wouldn't hurt as much!
{70774}{70823}Well, if you hadn't have run away,|this wouldn't have happened.
{70829}{70911}If you hadn't frightened me,|I wouldn't have run away.
{70917}{70979}Well, you shouldn't have been|in the west wing!
{70985}{71073}Well, you should learn|to control your temper!
{71119}{71234}Now, hold still.|This might sting a little.
{71272}{71413}By the way, thank you|for saving my life.
{71484}{71569}You're welcome.
{71688}{71785}I don't usually leave the asylum|in the middle of the night...
{71791}{71913}but he said you'd make it|worth my while.
{71919}{71992}- I'm listening.|- It's like this.
{71998}{72063}I've got my heart set|on marrying Belle.
{72069}{72148}But she needs a little persuasion.
{72154}{72205}Turned him down flat!
{72211}{72265}Everyone knows|her father's a lunatic.
{72271}{72353}He was in here tonight raving|about a beast in a castle.
{72359}{72393}Maurice is harmless.
{72399}{72470}The point is,|Belle would do anything...
{72476}{72549}to keep him|from being locked up.
{72555}{72639}Yeah, even marry him.
{72668}{72728}So you want me to throw her father|into the asylum...
{72734}{72813}unless she agrees to marry you.
{72819}{72973}Oh, that is despicable!|I love it!
{72994}{73063}If no one will help me,|then I'll go back alone!
{73069}{73138}Yes, is that everything?|I don't care what it takes!
{73144}{73203}I'll find that castle|and somehow, I...
{73209}{73297}I'll get her out of there.
{73404}{73467}- Belle! Maurice!|- Oh, well.
{73473}{73524}Guess it's not gonna work after all.
{73530}{73583}They have to come back sometime.
{73589}{73676}And when they do,|we'll be ready for them.
{73682}{73780}Lefou, don't move from that spot...
{73786}{73831}until Belle|and her father come home.
{73837}{73910}But... But I...
{73916}{74010}Ah, nuts!
{74504}{74611}I've never felt this way|about anyone.
{74616}{74705}I want to do something|for her, but what?
{74711}{74755}Well, there's the usual things.
{74761}{74833}Flowers, chocolates,|promises you don't intend to keep.
{74839}{74932}Ah, no, no, it has to be|something very special.
{74938}{75061}Something that sparks her interest.|Wait a minute!
{75079}{75120}Belle?
{75126}{75224}There's something|I want to show you.
{75228}{75324}But first,|you have to close your eyes.
{75338}{75451}It's a surprise.
{75636}{75721}- Can I open them?|- No, no. N-Not yet.
{75727}{75828}Wait here.
{75892}{76032}- Now can I open them?|- All right. Now!
{76196}{76257}I can't believe it!
{76263}{76311}I've never seen so many books|in all my life.
{76317}{76387}- You... You like it?|- It's wonderful!
{76393}{76488}- Then it's yours.|- Oh, thank you so much.
{76494}{76563}- Would you look at that!|- I knew it would work.
{76569}{76623}What? What works?
{76629}{76703}- It's very encouraging.|- Isn't this exciting?
{76709}{76766}- I didn't see anything.|- Come along, Chip.
{76772}{76820}There's chores to be done|in the kitchen.
{76826}{76947}But what are they talking about?|What's going on? Come on, Mom.
{78030}{78115}{y:i}There's something sweet|{y:i}and almost kind
{78121}{78202}{y:i}But he was mean|{y:i}and he was coarse and unrefined
{78208}{78299}{y:i}And now he's dear|{y:i}and so unsure
{78305}{78445}{y:i}I wonder why|{y:i}I didn't see it there before
{78717}{78804}{y:i}She glanced this way|{y:i}I thought I saw
{78810}{78892}{y:i}And when we touched|{y:i}she didn't shudder at my paw
{78898}{78987}{y:i}No, it can't be|{y:i}I'll just ignore
{78993}{79124}{y:i}But then she's never looked at me|{y:i}that way before
{79149}{79288}{y:i}New and a bit alarming
{79294}{79353}{y:i}Who'd have ever thought
{79359}{79512}{y:i}That this could be
{79518}{79565}{y:i}True
{79571}{79658}{y:i}That he's no Prince Charming
{79664}{79722}{y:i}But there's something in him
{79728}{79854}{y:i}That I simply didn't see
{79860}{79905}{y:i}- Well, who'd have thought|{y:i}- Well, bless my soul
{79911}{79955}{y:i}- Well, who'd have known|{y:i}- Well, who indeed
{79961}{80020}{y:i}And who'd have guessed|{y:i}they'd come together on their own
{80026}{80084}{y:i}- It's so peculiar, wait and see|{y:i}- We'll wait a see
{80090}{80134}{y:i}A few days more
{80140}{80242}{y:i}There may be something there|{y:i}that wasn't there before
{80248}{80262}{y:i}There may be something there|{y:i}that wasn't there before
{80268}{80363}{y:i}You know, perhaps there is something|{y:i}there that wasn't there before
{80369}{80408}What?
{80414}{80497}{y:i}There may be something there|{y:i}that wasn't there before
{80503}{80562}- What's there, Mama?|- Shh.
{80568}{80671}I'll tell you when you're older.
{80691}{80724}Right, then, you all know|why we're here.
{80730}{80809}We have exactly 12 hours,|36 minutes and 15 seconds...
{80815}{80855}to create the most magical,|spontaneous...
{80861}{80976}romantic atmosphere|known to man or beast.
{81082}{81140}Right. Need I remind you...
{81146}{81217}that as the last petal falls|from this rose...
{81223}{81317}the spell will never be broken!
{81323}{81379}Very well. You all know|your assignments.
{81385}{81464}Half of you to the west wing,|half of you to the east wing...
{81470}{81570}the rest of you,|come with me.
{81638}{81723}Lighten up, Cogsworth,|and let nature take its course.
{81729}{81777}It's obivious there's a spark|between them.
{81783}{81864}Yes, but there's no harm|in fanning the flames, you know...
{81870}{81902}a little.
{81908}{81990}Besides, they must fall in love tonight|if we ever expect to be human again.
{81996}{82062}- Ah, human again.|- Human again.
{82068}{82191}Yes, think what that means.
{82210}{82323}{y:i}I'll be cooking again|{y:i}Be good-looking again
{82329}{82415}{y:i}With a mademoiselle|{y:i}on each arm
{82421}{82504}{y:i}When I'm human again|{y:i}Only human again
{82510}{82597}{y:i}Poised and polished|{y:i}and gleaming with charm
{82603}{82687}{y:i}I'll be courting again|{y:i}Chic and sporting again
{82693}{82779}{y:i}Which should cause|{y:i}several husbands alarm
{82785}{82861}{y:i}I'll hop down off this shelf|{y:i}and tout suite be myself
{82867}{82988}{y:i}I can't wait to be human again
{83006}{83080}{y:i}Be human again|{y:i}Only human again
{83086}{83166}{y:i}We'll be knick-knacks|{y:i}and what-nots no more
{83172}{83248}{y:i}When we're human again|{y:i}Good and human again
{83254}{83334}{y:i}Oh, cherie,|{y:i}we'll be only top drawer
{83340}{83422}{y:i}I'll wear lipstick and rouge|{y:i}and I won't be so huge
{83428}{83504}{y:i}Why I'll easily fit through that door
{83510}{83556}{y:i}I'll exude savoir faire
{83562}{83600}{y:i}I'll wear gowns|{y:i}I'll have hair
{83606}{83741}{y:i}It's my birth|{y:i}to be human again
{83803}{83880}{y:i}When we're human again|{y:i}Only human again
{83886}{83963}{y:i}When the world once more|{y:i}starts making sense
{83969}{84004}{y:i}I'll unwind for a change
{84010}{84042}{y:i}Really that would be strange
{84048}{84128}{y:i}Can I help it if I'm t-t-tense
{84134}{84207}{y:i}In a shack by the sea|{y:i}I'll sit back sipping tea
{84213}{84288}{y:i}Let my early retirement commence
{84294}{84379}{y:i}Far from fools made of wax|{y:i}I'll get down to brass tacks
{84385}{84502}{y:i}- And relax|{y:i}- When I'm human again
{84508}{84583}{y:i}So sweep fast|{y:i}round the floor
{84589}{84670}{y:i}Let's let some light in the room
{84676}{84737}{y:i}I can feel I can tell|{y:i}Someone might break the spell
{84743}{84833}{y:i}Any day now
{84839}{84908}{y:i}Shine up the brass|{y:i}on the door
{84914}{84980}{y:i}Alert the dustbin and broom
{84986}{85073}{y:i}If it all goes as planned|{y:i}Our time may be at hand
{85079}{85156}{y:i}Any day now
{85162}{85238}{y:i}Open the shutters|{y:i}and let in some air
{85244}{85337}{y:i}Put these here|{y:i}and put those over there
{85343}{85416}{y:i}Sweep up the years|{y:i}of sadness and tears
{85422}{85570}{y:i}And throw them away
{85638}{85741}{y:i}We'll be human again|{y:i}Only human again
{85747}{85825}{y:i}When the girl finally|{y:i}sets us all free
{85831}{85904}{y:i}Cheeks a-bloomin' again|{y:i}We're assumin' again
{85910}{85992}{y:i}We'll assume our long lost|{y:i}joie de vivre
{85998}{86071}{y:i}We'll be playin' again|{y:i}Holidayin' again
{86077}{86155}{y:i}And we're prayin' its' A.S.A.P.
{86161}{86196}{y:i}We will push|{y:i}We will shove
{86202}{86252}{y:i}They will both fall in love
{86258}{86391}{y:i}And we'll finally be human again
{86397}{86450}"There never was a story|of more woe"
{86456}{86554}"Than this of Juliet|and her Romeo"
{86574}{86647}- Could you read it again?|- Here, why don't you read it to me?
{86653}{86747}Uh, all right.
{86819}{86882}- I can't.|- You mean, you never learned?
{86888}{86958}I learned... a little.
{86964}{87023}It's just been so long.
{87029}{87080}Well, here, I'll help you.
{87086}{87193}- Let's start here.|- Here.
{87200}{87247}- Okay. "Twoh..."|- "Two."
{87253}{87365}"Two." I knew that.|"Two households..."
{87371}{87510}{y:i}We'll be dancing again|{y:i}We'll be twirling again
{87516}{87591}{y:i}We'll be whirling around|{y:i}with such ease
{87597}{87664}{y:i}When we're human again|{y:i}Only human again
{87670}{87753}{y:i}We'll go waltzing|{y:i}those old one-two-threes
{87759}{87831}{y:i}We'll be floating again|{y:i}We'll be gliding again
{87837}{87918}{y:i}Stepping, striding|{y:i}As fine as you please
{87924}{87999}{y:i}Like a real human does
{88005}{88084}{y:i}I'll be all that I was
{88090}{88185}{y:i}On that glorious morn|{y:i}when we're finally reborn
{88191}{88280}{y:i}And we're all of us human
{88286}{88535}{y:i}Again
{88715}{88799}Tonight is the night.
{88816}{88890}- I'm not sure I can do this.|- You don't have time to be timid.
{88896}{88945}You must be bold, daring.
{88951}{89035}Bold! Daring!
{89076}{89169}There will be music,|romantic candlelight...
{89175}{89217}provided by myself.

{89319}{89364}Yes, I con...
{89370}{89414}I, I... No, I can't.
{89420}{89505}- You care for the girl, don't you?|- More than anything.
{89511}{89595}Well, then you must tell her.
{89601}{89688}Voila! Oh, you look so... so...
{89694}{89737}Stupid.
{89743}{89792}Not quite the word|I was looking for.

{93328}{93380}Off to the cupboard|with you now, Chip.
{93386}{93472}It's past your bedtime.
{93478}{93562}Good night, love.
{94090}{94174}Belle?
{94181}{94252}Are you happy here with me?
{94258}{94342}Yes.
{94403}{94465}What is it?
{94471}{94555}If only I could see my father again|just for a moment.
{94561}{94667}I miss him so much.
{94735}{94819}There is a way.
{94846}{94902}This mirror|will show you anything...
{94908}{94972}anything you wish to see.
{94978}{95091}I'd like to see my father, please.
{95214}{95282}Papa! Oh, no!
{95288}{95452}He's sick. He may be dying,|and he's all alone.
{95541}{95652}- Then you-you must go to him.|- What did you say?
{95658}{95737}I release you.|You're no longer my prisoner.
{95743}{95815}You mean, I'm free?
{95821}{95910}- Yes.|- Oh, thank you.
{95916}{96010}Hold on, Papa. I'm on my way.
{96043}{96105}Take it with you|so you'll always have a way...
{96111}{96251}to look back and remember me.
{96281}{96386}Thank you for understanding|how much he needs me.
{96556}{96615}Well, Your Highness, I must say...
{96621}{96670}everything is going|just swimmingly.
{96676}{96742}I knew you had it in you.
{96748}{96793}I let her go.
{96799}{96860}Yes, yes, splen...
{96866}{96963}You what?|How could you do that?
{96969}{97072}- I had to.|- Yes, but, but, but... but why?
{97078}{97160}Because I love her.
{97166}{97201}He did what?
{97207}{97301}- Yes, I'm afraid it's true.|- She's going away?
{97307}{97351}But he was so close.
{97357}{97461}After all this time,|he's finally learned to love.
{97467}{97527}That's it then.|That should break the spell!
{97533}{97637}But it's not enough.|She has to love him in return.
{97643}{97745}Now it's too late.
{97909}{98018}Papa? Papa?
{98328}{98416}They're back.
{98422}{98475}- Belle!|- Shh.
{98481}{98572}It's all right, Papa. I'm home.
{98578}{98654}I thought I'd never see you again.
{98660}{98715}- I missed you so much!|- But the beast...
{98721}{98784}- Did you... How did you escape?|- I didn't escape, Papa.
{98790}{98869}- He... He let me go.|- That horrible beast?
{98875}{99011}But he's different now, Papa.|He's changed somehow.
{99106}{99186}- Hi!|- Oh, a stowaway.
{99192}{99257}Why, hello there, little fella.
{99263}{99315}Y... Didn't think I'd see you again.
{99321}{99380}Belle, why'd you go away?
{99386}{99434}Don't you like us any more?
{99440}{99563}Oh, Chip. Of course I do.|It's just that...
{99599}{99680}- May I help you?|- I've come to collect your father.
{99686}{99747}- My father?|- Don't worry, mademoiselle.
{99753}{99841}We'll take good care of him.
{99847}{99920}- My father's not crazy!|- He was raving like a lunatic!
{99926}{100017}- We all heard him, didn't we?|- Yes!
{100023}{100091}- No, I won't let you!|- Belle?
{100097}{100157}Maurice, tell us again, old man.
{100163}{100246}Just how big was the beast?
{100252}{100332}He was... I mean,|he was... he was, uh, enormous!
{100338}{100472}I'd... I'd say at least eight,|uh, no, more like ten feet!
{100478}{100562}Well, you don't get|much crazier than that!
{100568}{100617}It's true, I tell you!
{100623}{100695}- Get him out of here!|- Let go of me!
{100701}{100778}No! You can't do this!
{100784}{100855}Poor Belle.|Oh, it's a shame about your father.
{100861}{100922}You know he's not crazy, Gaston.
{100928}{101044}I might be able to clear up|this little misunderstanding if...
{101050}{101113}- If what?|- If you marry me.
{101119}{101165}- What?|- One little word, Belle.
{101171}{101215}- That's all it takes.|- Never!
{101221}{101340}- Have it your way!|- Belle? Let go of me!
{101346}{101404}My father's not crazy|and I can prove it!
{101410}{101500}Show me the beast.
{101574}{101647}- Is it dangerous?|- Oh, no, no, he'd never hurt anyone.
{101653}{101771}Please, l-I know he looks vicious,|but he's really kind and gentle.
{101777}{101825}- He's my friend.|- If I didn't know better...
{101831}{101899}I'd think you had feelings|for this monster.
{101905}{101991}He's no monster, Gaston.|You are!
{101997}{102063}She's as crazy as the old man!
{102069}{102119}The beast will make off|with your children.
{102125}{102167}- He'll come after them in the night.|- No!
{102173}{102228}We're not safe till his head|is mounted on my wall!
{102234}{102296}I say we kill the beast!
{102302}{102375}{y:i}- We're not safe until he's dead|{y:i}- He'll come stalking us at night
{102381}{102462}{y:i}Set to sacrifice our children|{y:i}to his monstrous appetite
{102468}{102550}{y:i}He'll wreak havoc on our village|{y:i}if we let him wander free
{102556}{102640}{y:i}So it's time|{y:i}to take some action, boys
{102646}{102806}{y:i}It's time to follow me
{102811}{102875}{y:i}Through the mist, through the woods|{y:i}through the darkness and the shadows
{102881}{102955}{y:i}It's a nightmare|{y:i}but it's one exciting ride
{102961}{103037}{y:i}Say a prayer, then we're there|{y:i}at the drawbridge of a castle
{103043}{103119}{y:i}And there's something|{y:i}truly terrible inside
{103125}{103188}{y:i}It's a beast|{y:i}He's got fangs, razor sharp ones
{103194}{103267}{y:i}Massive paws, killer claws|{y:i}for the feast
{103273}{103354}{y:i}Hear him roar, see him foam|{y:i}But we're not coming home
{103360}{103433}{y:i}Till he's dead|{y:i}Good and dead
{103439}{103488}{y:i}- Kill the beast|- No, I won't let you do this.
{103494}{103550}If you're not with us,|you're against us.
{103556}{103622}- Bring the old man!|- Get your hands off me!
{103628}{103687}We can't have them running off|to warn the creature!
{103693}{103774}- Let us out!|- We'll rid the village of this beast!
{103780}{103848}- Who's with me?|- I am! I am!
{103854}{103897}- I am!|{y:i}- Light your torch, mount your horse
{103903}{103945}{y:i}Screw your courage|{y:i}to the sticking place
{103951}{104016}{y:i}We're counting on Gaston|{y:i}to lead the way
{104022}{104090}{y:i}Through a mist, to a wood|{y:i}where within a haunted castle
{104096}{104163}{y:i}Something's lurking|{y:i}that you don't see every day
{104169}{104256}{y:i}It's a beast|{y:i}One as tall as a mountain
{104262}{104326}{y:i}We won't rest|{y:i}till he's good and deceased
{104332}{104408}{y:i}Sally forth, tally-ho|{y:i}Grab your sword and your bow
{104414}{104446}{y:i}Praise the Lord and here we go
{104452}{104547}We'll lay siege to the castle|and bring back his head!
{104553}{104624}I have to warn the beast.|This is all my fault.
{104630}{104678}Oh, Papa, what are we going to do?
{104684}{104807}Now, now.|We'll think of something.
{104926}{104997}{y:i}We don't like what we don't understand|{y:i}In fact, it scares us
{105003}{105084}{y:i}And this monster|{y:i}is mysterious at least
{105090}{105159}{y:i}Bring your guns, bring your knives|{y:i}Save your children and your wives
{105165}{105235}{y:i}We'll save our village|{y:i}and our lives
{105241}{105285}{y:i}We'll kill the beast
{105291}{105363}I knew it. I knew it was foolish|to get our hopes up.
{105369}{105460}Maybe it would have been better|if she'd never come at all.
{105466}{105507}- Could it be?|- Is it she?
{105513}{105567}"Sacrebleu!" Invaders!
{105573}{105631}- Encroachers!|- And they have the mirror!
{105637}{105705}Warn the master. If it's a fight|they want, we'll be ready for them.
{105711}{105753}Who's with me?
{105759}{105803}Take whatever booty|you can find.
{105809}{105877}But remember,|the beast is mine!
{105883}{105948}{y:i}Hearts ablaze, banners high|{y:i}We go marching into battle
{105954}{106027}{y:i}Unafraid although the danger|{y:i}just increased
{106033}{106103}{y:i}Raise the flag, sing the song|{y:i}Here we come 50 strong
{106109}{106178}{y:i}And 50 Frenchmen can't be wrong
{106184}{106235}{y:i}Let's kill the beast
{106241}{106306}- Pardon me, Master.|- Leave me in peace.
{106312}{106368}But, sir,|the castle is under attack!
{106374}{106461}{y:i}Kill the beast|{y:i}Kill the beast
{106467}{106550}- This isn't working.|- Oh, Lumiere, we must do something!
{106556}{106609}Wait! I know!
{106615}{106705}{y:i}Kill the beast|{y:i}Kill the beast
{106708}{106757}What shall we do, Master?
{106763}{106848}It doesn't matter now.|Just let them come.
{106854}{106928}{y:i}Kill the beast|{y:i}Kill the beast
{106934}{107042}{y:i}Kill the beast
{107274}{107366}Now!
{107793}{107877}Yes!
{107912}{107988}Here we go!
{108035}{108093}What the devil?
{108099}{108195}Belle, look out!
{108286}{108391}You guys gotta try this thing.
{108461}{108529}Up here, you scurvy scum.

{110241}{110333}And stay out!
{111008}{111086}Get up!
{111092}{111130}Get up!
{111136}{111209}What's the matter, beast?
{111215}{111323}Too kind and gentle|to fight back?
{111463}{111564}No!
{111567}{111682}- Belle!|- No, Gaston, don't!
{111781}{111887}Let's go, Philippe.
{112417}{112513}Come on out and fight!
{112519}{112583}Were you in love with her,|beast?
{112589}{112648}Did you honestly think|she'd want you...
{112654}{112775}when she had someone like me?
{112990}{113119}It's over, beast!|Belle is mine!
{113213}{113287}Let me go! Let me go!|Please, don't hurt me.
{113293}{113398}I'll do anything. Anything!
{113681}{113742}Get out!

{114046}{114134}Belle?
{114213}{114301}You came back.
{115195}{115288}You... You came back.
{115294}{115342}Of course I came back.
{115348}{115440}I couldn't let them...|Oh, this is all my fault.
{115446}{115490}If only I'd gotten here sooner.
{115496}{115598}Maybe it's better...|it's better this way.
{115604}{115657}Don't talk like that.
{115663}{115717}You'll be all right.
{115723}{115863}We're together now. Everything's|going to be fine, you'll see.
{115869}{115913}At least...
{115919}{116061}I got to see you one last time.
{116286}{116349}No! No!
{116355}{116410}Please! Please!
