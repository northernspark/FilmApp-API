{8916}{8956}Polo!
{8958}{9094}I feel like coming here|sets her back a little, you know?
{9095}{9137}Seeing you like this,|I think she worries,
{9138}{9194}after what|her mother did,

{9279}{9306}Never
{9308}{9356}Look, I love Nikky|more than anything in the world.

{10658}{10691}We did our best,
{10693}{10741}and the operation|was successful,

{10844}{10932}the body just can't|handle the stress

{13580}{13622}You know, I'm sorry,|but I'm not on call
{13623}{13650}You're out of the city?

{18710}{18749}I've seen|some nasty accidents.
{18750}{18778}Yeah,|I'll keep that in mind.
{19596}{19669}Okay, what did you hit, kid?
{19670}{19693}I didn't hit anything.

{19735}{19798}We'll be up and running|any second now.
{20722}{20773}Any second now.
{21083}{21118}Told you|it didn't sound good.
{21164}{21197}It could be a silent alarm
{21198}{21237}We're not in a bank
{21238}{21262}I have my phone.
{21406}{21429}There's no service
{21623}{21684}Yeah, I probably shouldn't|use any more minutes anyhow.

{21818}{21864}I was actually hoping|this might happen.
{21866}{21907}God, Christ,|my life is empty.
{22038}{22118}I have just captured|the perfect image of angst.
{22119}{22154}Erase the picture.
{22155}{22178}Why?
{22179}{22207}Just do it
{22234}{22274}Just fuckin' do it
{22324}{22373}Okay?

{23499}{23526}Put what?
{23527}{23564}Oh, don't be|coy with me.
{23566}{23610}They were right here.
{23678}{23754}I don't go around|hiding your asthma inhaler.
{23755}{23866}My inhaler's not gonna kill me.
{23867}{23905}50 years from now,|who knows?
{23906}{23938}Mm, scientists.
{23940}{23962}There you go.
{24126}{24200}Aren't you going to join me?
{24202}{24225}No, I can't.
{24226}{24258}I have a to-do list|a mile long.
{24260}{24321}I should have never|gone to bed last night.
{24411}{24504}Are you going out|like that?
{24506}{24562}I left my black veil|at the cleaners
{24564}{24641}I want more skin,|not less
{24642}{24694}We live on the beach.|What are you, a nun?
{24696}{24754}Yes, Abuela,|I am a nun
{24778}{24854}When I was your age,|I set this town on fire
{24856}{24890}Let's go to the beach.
{24892}{24945}Uh-uh.|I can't
{24946}{24979}Mid-terms|start next week
{25037}{25074}Life is for living.
{25076}{25102}I know I know
{25103}{25126}I'm trying to do that.
{25127}{25152}I just...
{25154}{25190}have to take care|of some stuff first
{25238}{25330}Listen, I love you,|so don't take this the wrong way,
{25331}{25402}but you|are starting to suck.
{25404}{25460}If you don't break,|you'll bend.
{25462}{25553}Isn't it, if you don't bend,|you'll break, I think?
{25554}{25622}No, no.|No, it's not.
{25623}{25740}I mean, if you don't start|taking breaks and breathe,
{25742}{25823}you'll mist|into someone really horrible.
{25825}{25889}Okay, we'll go|to the beach,
{25890}{25945}just for a little while.
{26344}{26414}Keep Calm.
{26416}{26498}You are not in danger.
{26551}{26587}Got any water|in here, dude?
{26589}{26621}In most cases,
{26622}{26720}the elevator mechanic|will arrive in 30 minutes
{26722}{26778}01:38|and counting.
{27374}{27402}Hey.

{29596}{29658}Hello?
{29659}{29721}Hello!
{29722}{29785}We need help|with the elevator
{31203}{31226}Let it go on three.

{31297}{31358}Shit
{31359}{31388}Somebody must've heard us.
{31390}{31423}This building|is empty, man.
{31425}{31462}Even the freaking|Golden Girls are gone.

{31510}{31554}There's got to be-|there's that couple, right?
{31555}{31605}They have a newborn baby.
{31606}{31647}People don't go|on vacations with babies
{31649}{31673}Really?
{31674}{31703}Have you been|on an airplane lately?
{31705}{31734}Hey, we're|all in this together.
{31736}{31762}You don't have|to be an asshole

{31828}{31881}- That's not-|- Look!
{31882}{31907}Let's calm down, okay?
{31996}{32025}With this heat wave,
{32026}{32093}every air-conditioner|in the city's running.
{32094}{32125}It's a blackout
{32126}{32176}Well, then, that means the power|should be back on soon
{32178}{32213}Well, the one a few years ago|lasted almost mo days.
{32214}{32250}Someone died|in a fucking elevator.
{32251}{32274}They died?
{32275}{32301}It's not a blackout
{32302}{32336}How do you explain|the emergency lights?
{32338}{32368}It's a back-up generator, genius.
{32370}{32418}My hospital|has a back-up generator.
{32419}{32464}Banks have|back-up generators.
{32466}{32494}Well, what if|the elevator's broken?
{32496}{32518}Huh?
{32520}{32543}Wait, wait, wait.
{32545}{32582}How many units have been rented?

{32654}{32686}Half finished?
{32688}{32782}There's five
{32813}{32865}Well, there's-|okay, this is three.

{32957}{32998}Okay, Maurie sisters.|That makes four
{33000}{33046}And the couple who are staying|with their relatives
{33048}{33082}while they're having|their plumbing redone.
{33084}{33118}They got a baby in tow.
{33120}{33158}That makes five
{33310}{33357}This could be a while
{33394}{33441}Shit
{34106}{34142}It's a gateway drug.
{34144}{34187}You got to start somewhere.
{35252}{35320}Tommy?
{35322}{35350}I wanted|to ask you something.
{35386}{35466}Someone told Olivia|at school that
{35467}{35530}last year, you were banging Evie,
{35532}{35577}among others.
{35753}{35842}Sometimes I just worry|that you do this with everyone,
{35844}{35973}that your promises,|things you say...
{35974}{36041}I don't think|it's an act, but...
{36329}{36384}Help us!
{36386}{36423}I need|to get out of here!
{36425}{36447}Don't yell!

{36982}{37004}You motherfucker
{37006}{37030}I'm really sorry.
{37032}{37054}Oh, Jesus,|let me get a look at that.
{37055}{37078}Please
{37126}{37148}You got to keep|pressure on the lip.
{37150}{37178}Without ice,|that's going to swell.
{37179}{37202}Get off me, man!
{37204}{37227}Hey, stop yelling.
{37229}{37251}Don't tell me what to do!

{37400}{37529}Okay, the air is getting|really thin in here, okay?
{37552}{37594}We need to relax
{37596}{37658}We need to think logically, okay?
{37721}{37744}Let me get that knife.
{38125}{38172}Okay.
{38221}{38261}The mountains it ain't,
{38262}{38310}but it's not bad
{38610}{38710}I know I didn't know you then,|and I shouldn't care, but...
{38711}{38767}Look Evie
{38769}{38806}it was a drunk thing.
{38807}{38874}It was once
{38875}{38903}And you...
{38905}{38969}You're pretty much|the only right choice
{38970}{39038}I've ever made|in my life.
{39039}{39067}And you know that l-
{39069}{39100}Francesca!
{39102}{39149}Shh
{39150}{39192}Francesca?
{39194}{39225}Fuck. It's early.
{39226}{39274}He must've lost.|He must've lost bad
{39275}{39316}Lost at what?|Cards
{39318}{39341}Get dressed
{39366}{39418}You never told me|your father gambles.
{39419}{39469}Doesn't everyone?
{39470}{39498}Did you put it somewhere?
{39500}{39541}Where is the mail?
{39542}{39566}Is he-I mean,|are you going to be okay?
{39568}{39666}One fucking thing for me,|and you can't even do that.
{39668}{39693}Francesca!
{39694}{39730}You said your father|was an accountant
{39732}{39755}You said he never drinks
{39757}{39787}He's not,|and he does
{39789}{39820}I'll tell you the rest|of the gory details later,
{39822}{39854}but right now,|you need to get out.
{39855}{39916}I'm the only one that can|calm him when he loses
{39918}{39971}He can't stay mad|at his little girl.
{40022}{40045}Go
{40862}{40910}Hey.

{41858}{41882}It's cool
{43066}{43135}It's okay.
{43285}{43319}You have a family?
{43321}{43352}I have a daughter,|yeah.
{43381}{43431}She's eight.
{43433}{43475}She's coming at 2:30 tomorrow.
{43477}{43537}I don't think I've ever|seen her around here
{43538}{43606}We have a house|outside the city.
{43607}{43637}I bought this apartment
{43638}{43710}for nights I work late|at the hospital.
{43743}{43774}You have a wife?
{43775}{43829}She's, um...

{44068}{44154}Oh, I'm so sorry.
{44160}{44198}Yeah, well, it was hard.
{44200}{44292}It was hard|for a long time.
{44294}{44386}But, you know, when I look|at my daughter now,
{44387}{44498}I can still-|I can still see my wife in her.
{44500}{44551}You know,|she's never really gone.
{44823}{44862}I think I can handle one more
{45191}{45260}It's really so nice|to finally hang out with a guy
{45262}{45342}and not have to worry about...
{45344}{45406}not have to worry about,|you know?
{45408}{45459}Yeah, I know|what you mean.
{46293}{46338}Go on
{46946}{46983}Okay, one, two, three.
{47086}{47122}What do you see|up there?
{47123}{47146}Is there a door?
{47227}{47260}The one back here is wall
{47262}{47306}but there's another|about 15 feet up there.
{47307}{47357}Maybe I can try|to open it.
{47358}{47401}Do you think|you can climb up there?
{47402}{47431}You need help up there?
{47433}{47482}No, no. It's all right. I can reach it.
{47484}{47528}Oh, thank God.
{47530}{47570}We're gonna be okay.
{47702}{47725}Shit
{47726}{47750}Oh, God.
{48115}{48174}I'm sorry|about before,
{48175}{48208}when I hit him
{48210}{48256}Oh, it's all right.
{48258}{48323}You had to do something.
{48325}{48382}I was afraid|it might upset you.
{48398}{48442}I'm fine
{48444}{48494}Besides, he seems|to be over it
{49601}{49637}I feel like I'm never going to graduate.
{49638}{49687}I wish your grandfather|could've seen you...
{49689}{49728}Worked in response...
{49730}{49755}Life is for living?
{49757}{49789}What does that|even mean?
{49848}{49876}I am living my life right now.
{49878}{49916}You were just wonderful.
{49918}{49941}Life is work
{49942}{49981}That's what I have to do
{49982}{50006}I want better things for you.
{50007}{50038}Maybe it'll change at some point.
{50039}{50076}Better and better
{50381}{50472}As soon as we get out of here,|there's something I have to do
{50474}{50538}Something about... that?
{50540}{50573}I mean the blood
{50574}{50679}Some kind of accident?
{50681}{50704}It's okay.
{50706}{50736}You don't have to
{51234}{51300}I have something|I need to do too
{51302}{51366}Does it have to do|with your daughter?
{51368}{51446}More like|for my daughter.
{51448}{51547}She's getting dropped off|here tomorrow, 2:30.
{51549}{51586}And I really need|to clean up.
{51587}{51622}She might not like|what she'd find
{51786}{51820}Come here
{51822}{51924}Sit down
{51926}{51981}Would you like|some wine?
{51982}{52011}Yeah, I'd love some.
{52013}{52092}Red?|White?
{52094}{52179}Pink?
{52181}{52244}White sounds good.
{52246}{52279}Okay.
{52663}{52691}Thanks
{52781}{52838}Come on.|Get loose
{52840}{52874}Feel like you're at home.
{52943}{52990}Put your head back.
{52992}{53072}This place, it's kind of like|my bachelor pad, you know?
{53074}{53113}I usually use it for alone time.
{53214}{53242}What is it, porn?
{53243}{53328}Do I look|like that kind of guy?
{53330}{53394}Yes, porn.
{53460}{53556}Let yourself go.
{53558}{53626}Let go.
{53627}{53650}Lose it with me
{54339}{54370}Uh!
{54873}{54921}Oh, my God.
{55057}{55089}Shit
{55135}{55186}What the hell was that?
{55227}{55279}What the fuck|did you do up there?
{55281}{55347}Hey, are you okay up there?
{55382}{55406}Don't touch my leg.
{55407}{55437}Don't touch it.|Don't touch it
{55438}{55498}Ugh.
{55581}{55620}It's that bad, huh?
{55622}{55652}What the fuck|did you do up there?
{55654}{55676}Karl, help me, please.
{55678}{55722}No, no, no!|No, no.
{55724}{55755}- Hey.
{55757}{55798}Karl, please!
{55799}{55846}Please
{55863}{55894}Oh, fuck.
{55896}{55918}Ah!
{55920}{55959}Grab that knife
{56138}{56170}Oh, God.
{56171}{56223}Oh, God.
{56225}{56264}Well, it's definitely broken.
{56266}{56297}Is he going to be okay?
{56298}{56329}If we get out of here soon, yes.
{56330}{56356}We don't-
{56358}{56380}Wait. I don't want|to lose my leg.
{56382}{56414}Yeah, well|that's a long ways off.
{56415}{56444}But we can do something.
{56446}{56488}I have some pills,|some painkillers.
{56490}{56534}I have water here
{56646}{56683}You could've|mentioned that sooner
{56685}{56714}Sorry.
{56715}{56765}For the pain, Tommy.
{56827}{56854}I|Just don't drink it all|okay?
{56856}{56884}That's all we have
{56886}{56909}That's it
{57329}{57357}What does it say?
{57392}{57429}Your emerg-
{57430}{57458}Help!
{57459}{57503}Help!|We need medical attention in here
{57505}{57555}Please help!
{57557}{57589}I think it only works|one way.
{57590}{57626}Please help us!
{57627}{57658}Please
{57659}{57713}We're aware of your emergency.
{57714}{57746}Please stay calm.
{57748}{57834}An elevator mechanic|will be with you shortly.
{57836}{57882}And make it quick.
{57884}{57918}Thank God
{57968}{58007}Any second now.
{58049}{58093}How do you think they're|going to pull us out of here?
{58094}{58130}Let them worry|about the logistics.
{58132}{58169}Right now, I just want|to get out of here.
{58170}{58270}We're aware of your emergency.
{58272}{58321}Please stay calm.
{58322}{58401}An elevator mechanic|will be with you shortly.
{58528}{58633}We're aware|of your emergency.
{58634}{58686}Please stay calm.
{58687}{58762}An elevator mechanic|will be with you shortly.
{59193}{59318}We're aware|of your emergency.
{59320}{59438}Please stay calm.
{60034}{60060}Almost 4:00 in the morning.
{60101}{60156}Been in here|nine hours
{60269}{60310}Severe internal bleeding.
{60311}{60390}Her organs|are beyond repair.
{60391}{60487}If she wasn't such a fighter,|she'd be gone already.
{60564}{60621}Is she in pain?
{60643}{60684}She's sedated,|but she's conscious
{60686}{60719}Does she know?
{60760}{60855}I was under explicit orders|not to feed her any bullshit.
{61019}{61142}Do you want me to call anyone,|parents, an aunt or uncle?
{61194}{61241}No, there's, um...
{61298}{61382}There's nobody.
{61383}{61478}It's always just been me|and my grandma, pretty much, so...
{61601}{61651}I'd like to see her now
{61802}{61826}Help me!
{62461}{62510}Maybe we should sleep in shifts.
{62512}{62538}What's that going to do, kid?
{62539}{62575}If this elevator collapses,
{62577}{62631}it's going to do it whether|or not we're keeping guard.
{62633}{62680}Remember, it's going to be|daylight soon.
{62725}{62821}And if one of us hears something,|like people outside,
{62822}{62934}we should be able to yell.
{62936}{62959}Tommy's right.
{62961}{63016}Of course he's right.
{63018}{63078}He disagreed with me.
{63079}{63121}So you want to go first?
{63702}{63753}I can't take this anymore.
{63853}{63950}What are we going to do?
{63951}{64024}What can I do?
{64145}{64194}Tet's run away.
{64195}{64227}After last night,|he'll come back
{64229}{64270}And things are only|gonna get worse.
{64272}{64300}You know it
{64302}{64330}That's crazy.
{64331}{64359}What's crazy|is staying here with him.
{64361}{64420}We don't have|the money for that.
{64422}{64459}No, but my father does.
{64461}{64536}And I know|where he keeps it.
{64538}{64561}My father...
{64654}{64727}He always keeps some cash|around the house for betting.
{64729}{64790}I found a wad yesterday.
{64791}{64814}Take it
{64815}{64842}He owes you.
{64843}{64866}If he finds out it's missing-
{64867}{64917}No, we'll be|at the airport.
{64918}{64966}Tonight?
{65058}{65125}Tonight.
{65193}{65315}We need to think about|rationing that water.
{65317}{65348}He needs it
{65350}{65412}Yeah, well, he's going|to need it in six hours too
{65414}{65454}And we'll need it|in six hours
{65492}{65567}We weren't the ones|who tried to play superhero.
{65569}{65606}We're gonna be|out of here by then.
{65608}{65659}Yeah?
{65661}{65684}I hope so.
{66634}{66670}Hey.
{66672}{66694}No way.
{66696}{66730}Excuse me?
{66732}{66780}Please don't.|I have asthma
{67054}{67094}I'll blow my smoke|out the opening.
{67095}{67134}Sorry. No.
{67135}{67166}Look, it's been a long time, lady.
{67167}{67216}I don't know if you've|ever had an addiction-
{67218}{67241}Oh, I don't know|if you've ever had
{67242}{67274}your throat close up|on you before.
{67276}{67309}Well, you have|your inhaler, right?
{67310}{67342}Yeah, but that's|not he point-
{67344}{67388}Well, you know,|you'll be fine.
{67390}{67445}I'm a doctor|remember? '
{67561}{67594}Tommy?
{67630}{67663}Tommy!
{67797}{67830}Tommy, I know you're in there.
{67832}{67902}I saw your motorcycle outside.
{67981}{68034}Thanks a lot,|asshole
{68138}{68161}Put it out
{68162}{68242}I have asthma
{68243}{68298}I said, "Cut it out."
{68299}{68348}I asked you|to put it out, now.
{68350}{68394}I'm telling you|to put that thing out.
{68396}{68425}I'm almost done
{68426}{68458}It's blowing back|in the room
{68460}{68490}No, it isn't.
{68491}{68514}Stop fighting.
{68588}{68622}This isn't good|for any of us.
{68623}{68663}Jesus Christ,|calm down, Claudia.
{68665}{68693}Maybe you should have one.
{68694}{68736}Oh, okay, you want|to fucking pollute the air?
{68738}{68785}Go ahead. We'll just|close the fucking door.
{68786}{68809}Ow!
{68810}{68833}Sorry.
{68834}{68869}Fucking bitch!
{68870}{68917}And everything|for a fucking cigarette!
{68992}{69033}Great. Now we got|a regular gimp collection.
{69034}{69070}I said I'm sorry.
{69072}{69127}It's been five hours, and we're already|like ord of the flies
{69129}{69151}I said I'm sorry, okay?
{69153}{69178}Just like a woman!
{69180}{69206}Look, this isn't helping.
{69287}{69322}And, you know,|it's true, kid.
{69324}{69376}You used to be able to smoke|anywhere, fucking anywhere:
{69378}{69465}Movie theaters, airplanes,|hospitals, supermarkets.
{69466}{69520}Fucking moral majority's|taken over!
{69522}{69550}Calm down
{69551}{69614}Oh, God,|I need to get out of here.
{69616}{69650}Let us out of here!
{69651}{69685}I hate this God damn-
{69730}{69770}Let us the fuck out!
{69771}{69798}Oh, my God,|you have a temper.
{69799}{69822}God!
{69824}{69852}What, just like a woman?
{69854}{69897}Exactly, just like a woman|to set a guy off...
{69946}{70023}And then calmly criticize him|for blowing up!
{70025}{70062}What the fuck|is your problem?
{70126}{70151}This is it
{70324}{70382}Nobody move.
{70383}{70406}Shit
{70675}{70702}Don't fucking move.
{70704}{70729}Shh
{70784}{70814}Tommy?
{70999}{71046}Tommy?
{71919}{71990}We were born in these lives,|Francesca
{71991}{72034}We didn't have a choice
{72035}{72114}But it's time that we take over|and do it for ourselves
{72690}{72718}help me!
{73122}{73172}Don't cry.
{73174}{73238}Abuela, I'm sorry.
{73315}{73399}When it's your turn,|it's your turn.
{73500}{73547}Shh, don't talk.
{73549}{73587}It's okay.
{73589}{73638}I have to
{73639}{73730}Last chance|to piss you off.
{73732}{73792}Abuela,|it's not funny.
{73794}{73885}Remember
{73886}{73966}you'll have to bend-
{73967}{74004}Isn't it "break"?
{74006}{74053}Whatever
{74100}{74157}I just need you|to get me something.
{74158}{74270}The photograph|on my table.
{74272}{74362}I need him with me|when my time comes.
{74364}{74410}I'll get you|the photograph.
{74411}{74451}At this point, it's a matter of time.
{74490}{74514}How long?
{74547}{74591}Uh, maybe tomorrow,
{74593}{74634}maybe...
{74636}{74681}in a few hours
{74721}{74745}Claudia
{74746}{74805}Hurry.
{74865}{74915}I love you.
{74937}{74981}Hurry.
{75680}{75733}You've been holding out on us.
{75818}{75840}What?
{75842}{75869}First water
{75870}{75916}Now candy?
{75918}{75962}Fucking convenience store|you got there.
{76076}{76102}Asshole.|What the-
{76104}{76149}what are you doing?
{76150}{76183}What the-
{76250}{76273}Give it to me
{76274}{76319}Give me|the candy bar.
{76511}{76550}No
{76552}{76598}Don't.|Jesus, don't.
{76600}{76638}Here
{76639}{76665}Give it back, please.
{76666}{76708}What the fuck?
{76710}{76752}That isn't cool, man.
{76778}{76819}Give it back to me, please.
{76821}{76854}I'd rather not
{76918}{77013}Chill out, man.
{77086}{77110}Now, look...
{77178}{77211}We're not going|to get out of here
{77213}{77265}until we stop|yelling at each other
{77266}{77292}and start working together.
{77294}{77382}And we need one person, one,
{77384}{77407}to make all the decisions
{77409}{77497}We need a strong leader.
{77498}{77557}Now, I'm just|strengthening my hand.
{77558}{77592}And don't worry.
{77594}{77638}I'll give you a hit|when you need one,
{77639}{77702}if you behave.
{77841}{77888}What kind of a monster are you?
{77937}{77977}Monster?
{78039}{78098}Don't you think you're being|a bit dramatic?
{78392}{78456}Maybe I'm just destined|for something else.
{78480}{78520}I don't know
{78522}{78590}I'd like to think I'm meant|for higher things, though, you know?
{78592}{78649}Higher things.
{78710}{78757}My father always told me,
{78758}{78824}"To endure|is to conquer our fate."
{78826}{78849}Fate?
{78850}{78875}Yeah
{78877}{78902}Do you really believe|that shit?
{78946}{78983}I like your eyes.
{78985}{79024}Destiny sucks.
{79675}{79713}You'll be fine
{79714}{79753}Yeah, you'll be fine.
{80183}{80214}There's no chance
{80380}{80404}No destiny.
{80474}{80521}No fate
{80643}{80698}There's only|what you take from the world
{80699}{80742}and what the world|takes from you.
{80807}{80833}You know that now,
{80834}{80925}don't you...
{80926}{80976}my darling?
{81734}{81806}What the hell are you doing, man?
{81807}{81881}Just making sure everything still works.
{82147}{82227}She's pretty good-looking, isn't she?
{82229}{82286}I got a girlfriend, man.
{82287}{82334}At least I did
{82336}{82378}God, I hope|she's okay.
{82379}{82412}He's going to know by now.
{82414}{82477}Oh, boo-hoo.
{82478}{82522}My little girl sees|the mess I made upstairs,
{82524}{82548}let me just say,
{82550}{82584}her idea of me|as the perfect father
{82586}{82631}is going to be|severely tested.
{82633}{82662}2:30
{82664}{82743}She's going|to be up there at 2:30.
{82745}{82793}And her lips|were trembling,
{82794}{82861}and I take this blade,|and I cut her up.
{82862}{82926}And it's beautiful.|It's fucking beautiful.
{82927}{82976}We were supposed|to run away to Paris.
{83054}{83085}Do people still run away?
{83086}{83134}I thought|we placated all you kids
{83135}{83210}with cell phones|and video games.
{83211}{83237}Shut up, man.
{83238}{83265}No, I'm just|kidding around.
{83266}{83326}Paris, it's a great city.
{83327}{83367}The food
{83369}{83398}Some of the women there
{83399}{83482}are even more sexually|adventurous than I am,
{83483}{83531}and that's|saying something.
{83607}{83671}We're going to have|to get something on these cuts.
{83673}{83722}What do you think|she's like?
{83776}{83798}What do you mean?
{83800}{83856}Usually the hot ones,
{83858}{83882}they just lay there.
{83883}{83934}You're out of line, man.
{83936}{83974}It's true
{83975}{84010}Bitches are so used|to getting there way.
{84011}{84063}And why?
{84065}{84102}Just 'cause|they look pretty.
{84170}{84206}Salt
{84362}{84404}Up and down.
{84487}{84517}She seems|like she likes this
{84518}{84546}Salt
{84666}{84738}They get all the jobs.
{84740}{84836}They get|all the attention
{84838}{84889}But what about|the rest of us, Tommy?
{84890}{84930}What about us?
{84931}{84974}Sometimes I wonder
{84975}{85091}why was I born|in such a fucked-up era?
{85093}{85134}Yeah, man.
{85135}{85158}Fucked up.
{85160}{85187}Yeah
{85189}{85326}Well, you'll see what I mean|someday, buddy.
{85454}{85477}Pills, man.
{85478}{85520}Please.|Please
{85803}{85869}7:30
{85870}{85936}Hope.
{85938}{85994}Let's have|some fucking hope.
{86170}{86215}They're gonna find her.
{86217}{86256}They're gonna find her.
{86983}{87042}Can you feel me now?
{87238}{87330}Can you feel me now?
{88001}{88028}The building, man.
{88030}{88115}Do you think...
{88117}{88163}Do you think|it was terrorists?
{88165}{88215}Terrorists?
{88217}{88286}In the Bifrost Bridge Building?
{88288}{88310}Yeah
{88312}{88370}You know what?
{88372}{88451}I'd say it was|definitely terrorists.
{88453}{88486}But how do you think|they made it past
{88487}{88527}all the security downstairs?
{88560}{88647}Maybe it was aliens, man.
{88750}{88800}Like in|The Twilight Zone,
{88802}{88858}when the electricity goes out,
{88860}{88953}and everybody thinks|it was everyone else.
{88954}{89021}But really,
{89022}{89079}it was aliens
{89081}{89142}Well
{89144}{89198}I don't know|about that
{89199}{89263}But there's one thing|I do know,
{89265}{89390}and that is that if I don't|get out of here soon,
{89392}{89476}I'm going to cut|your fucking throat...
{89478}{89534}and I'm going to rape|the shit out of that cunt
{89622}{89645}What?
{91699}{91781}Oh, God, how many cigarettes|have you smoked?
{91782}{91830}Please give me|my inhaler.
{91957}{91980}Give it to me
{92011}{92051}Please give me|my inhaler.
{92200}{92223}Please
{92383}{92422}God damn it
{92423}{92509}You'll get over it.
{92510}{92582}I want to show you|something.
{92583}{92614}Look
{92657}{92688}Come here
{92754}{92782}Look
{92806}{92838}Fire alarm
{92894}{92922}You hold this
{92924}{93004}underneath the sensor
{93006}{93062}and we'll be hearing sirens|before you've even climbed down.
{93063}{93094}I'm having|a hard time breathing.
{93096}{93118}- You want a hit?|- Please
{93121}{93182}- Okay.|- No
{93251}{93283}And since you're going up there anyway...
{93453}{93592}Now, look, I really,|really need to excuse myself
{93594}{93710}from this elevator
{93712}{93837}So don't you dream|of coming back here
{93838}{93901}without setting|that alarm off
{95823}{95879}Come on.|You can do this
{95881}{95917}You can do this
{95918}{95958}Come on
{96690}{96738}Come on
{97524}{97556}What the
{97599}{97680}Fuck
{97682}{97682}Claudia?
{97715}{97723}Claudia?
{97725}{97764}My daughter|should be here by now.
{97766}{97861}Oh, you are dead,|you fucking cunt.
{98048}{98070}Claudia
{98072}{98143}Claudia?
{98403}{98430}Hey.
{98432}{98454}I'm right here.
{98456}{98486}Are you okay?
{98488}{98537}Yeah, listen, I was on the top|of the elevator right now.
{98538}{98562}Jesus
{98658}{98681}What's going on?
{98682}{98714}Karl
{98716}{98761}Can you imagine how|she's going to react?
{98762}{98785}What?
{98786}{98836}My little girl,
{98838}{98870}Nikky.
{98871}{98914}Nobody should need|to see that kind of thing.
{99002}{99037}I protected her|the first time
{99038}{99063}What are you talking about, Karl?
{99065}{99088}I did
{99090}{99114}Why are you-
{99116}{99186}You can plan|your whole life out.
{99264}{99336}You can plot|the most complex course.
{99396}{99427}But sooner or later
{99429}{99494}you're going to walk|into some piece-of-shit elevator.
{99495}{99526}Karl?
{99528}{99554}Listen to me.|listen
{99555}{99590}I was on top|of the elevator right now.
{99592}{99631}I looked over the side,
{99633}{99677}and I could see that|we're almost at floor level
{99678}{99751}The optimism of youth.
{99753}{99860}It's remarkably enduring.
{99862}{99928}In fact
{99930}{99993}it's usually|the last thing to go
{99994}{100050}when I cut some bitch up.
{100052}{100087}Fuck
{100089}{100253}Their eyes pleading|and hoping to the end.
{100322}{100380}You can almost|hear them thinking,
{100382}{100406}"This isn't me"
{100408}{100454}No, this isn't me.
{100456}{100479}Get the fuck|away from me.
{100481}{100514}This isn't my life.
{100515}{100542}I got class tonight.
{100543}{100574}I can't be late for class"
{100576}{100606}Get the fuck|away from me.
{100608}{100641}Why do they always say that?
{100642}{100689}Stop it.
{100690}{100754}Hey, you want|to play something?
{100756}{100784}Marco
{100810}{100876}Come on, guys.
{100878}{100918}Marco
{100919}{100953}Please stop.
{100985}{101024}The way it goes:
{101026}{101087}Marco
{102181}{102259}You killed him
{102261}{102317}Finally,
{102318}{102386}some privacy.
{102388}{102430}You killed him
{102628}{102660}What's the point, Claudia?
{102662}{102687}We all know|how this ends
{102689}{102722}Please
{102724}{102781}You think the others|didn't say please?
{102782}{102814}I can get us out of here.
{102816}{102844}Give me the knife
{102846}{102890}You have got|to be kidding me.
{102891}{102955}Okay, I won't tell anyone.
{102957}{103044}Please have a conscience
{103046}{103077}Think about|your daughter.
{103078}{103111}Daddy.
{103113}{103136}What are you doing?
{103206}{103238}Please
{103239}{103309}Daddy, you're not playing well.
{103363}{103390}What conscience?
{103456}{103510}She'll never learn!
{103511}{103566}So now learn!
{103912}{103944}Oh!
{104163}{104190}Get off!
{104284}{104350}Ah!
{104674}{104726}Uh!
{104728}{104760}Get fucking back here!
{106724}{106776}police radio chatter
{108829}{108861}Hey, Claudia.
{108904}{108947}Claudia?
{109066}{109178}How is she?
{109179}{109239}My grandmother;|how is she?
{109241}{109281}We'll talk about it later
{109370}{109401}Tell me now
{109492}{109557}I'm sorry.
{109719}{109869}I didn't get her|the photograph.
{109870}{109923}I tried
{110006}{110078}Why do things|like this happen?
{110154}{110230}I used to think|about that too
{110231}{110278}After working here|for a while
{110306}{110401}I don't think|there is any reason,
{110402}{110482}no pattern.
{110483}{110546}Yeah
{110548}{110584}You get some rest, okay?
