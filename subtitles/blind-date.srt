<i>If you want a song played,</i>
<i>call the radio station right now.</i>

4
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,987
<i>You park in an abandoned lot.</i>
<i>You attend the movie.</i>

5
00:00:56,297 --> 00:01:01,030
<i>You come out to find that thieves</i>
<i>have ripped off your stereo.</i>

6
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,167
<i>This wouldn't have happened...</i>

7
00:01:09,377 --> 00:01:14,679
<i>...if you'd purchased the</i>
<i>James Brown auto alarm! Listen!</i>

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,856
<i>The James Brown auto alarm,</i>

00:01:25,493 --> 00:01:27,654
<i>The James Brown auto alarm.</i>

10
00:01:27,996 --> 00:01:30,362
<i>Get yours today!</i>

11
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,925
What are you doing?

12
00:02:34,262 --> 00:02:36,594
-Here.
-Oh, never mind.

13
00:02:42,303 --> 00:02:43,895
Morning.

14
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,605
Coffee.

15
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:58,545
What time did you go home
last night, 3:00 a.m.?

16
00:02:58,753 --> 00:03:01,881
You look like you've been
in a plane crash.

17
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:07,460
-This may shock you, but humans sleep.
-I know, I know.

18
00:03:08,463 --> 00:03:12,991
Gruen gave me a big project.
I think it's some kind of test.

19
00:03:13,267 --> 00:03:17,465
Where's my depreciation schedule?
I've lost my deprec--

20
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:21,432
I think I have everything.
Profit plan...

21
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,168
...flow charts....

22
00:03:24,445 --> 00:03:28,142
-How much time do I have?
-Four minutes.

23
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:31,851
Walter.

24
00:03:33,621 --> 00:03:37,455
-You should wind down.
-I'm getting something out of it.

25
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,722
You won't believe
what happened last night.

26
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,093
You worked on your presentation?
Not at all?

27
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,700
I had drinks at The Blue Dragon--

28
00:03:48,936 --> 00:03:51,871
Don't tell me one of your sex stories.

29
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:57,169
-Bringing the embalmer tonight?
-She's not an embalmer. She does hair.

30
00:03:57,411 --> 00:04:02,644
-No. I have a date with a gorgeous--
-In the parking lot of the club...

31
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:06,377
...I see this woman,
maybe 35, kind of classy.

32
00:04:06,654 --> 00:04:11,751
I figure she's waiting for her car.
So, what the hell, I talk to her.

33
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:17,359
Turns out, she came in a limo. I say,
''I've never been in a limo before.''

34
00:04:17,565 --> 00:04:21,968
She stares at me for 30 seconds,
then says, ''Let's take a ride.''

35
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:27,608
In the limo, she pushes a button and
a wall's up between us and the driver.

36
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:31,267
She hits another button,
a sunroof opens.

37
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,141
Bar slides open.

38
00:04:34,348 --> 00:04:38,148
She pours us vodka,
plays Sly and the Family Stone.

39
00:04:38,352 --> 00:04:41,480
Next thing I know, we slide onto PCH.

40
00:04:45,193 --> 00:04:48,959
Full moon, 2:00 a.m,
vodka, limo, music.

41
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:50,994
And I'm thinking....

42
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,430
-I don't believe you.
-We start to kiss.

43
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:58,935
I slide my hand up her dress.
What do I find? Garter belt!

44
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:03,474
-All your women wear garter belts!
-So I tell her I want her...

45
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:08,411
...from behind, standing up,
with my head sticking out the sunroof.

46
00:05:08,616 --> 00:05:10,140
So we start doing it.

47
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:14,378
We're going 60, my head's out
the roof, my hair's flying....

48
00:05:14,622 --> 00:05:19,559
This didn't happen. There was
no limo, no woman, no sunroof--

49
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:23,296
That's disgusting.

50
00:05:23,497 --> 00:05:28,525
I'm ashamed to know you. How do you
get women to do these things?

51
00:05:29,103 --> 00:05:34,234
As you know by now, Yakamoto has
agreed to entrust the management...

52
00:05:34,442 --> 00:05:38,435
...of all his personal
and corporate assets to us.

53
00:05:38,646 --> 00:05:42,082
No small thanks
to the efforts of Harry Gruen.

54
00:05:43,284 --> 00:05:46,276
I'm sure Mr. Yakamoto's
confidence in us...

55
00:05:46,487 --> 00:05:51,117
...will increase with the lethal charm
you'll all exude tonight.

56
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:53,327
A word of caution.

57
00:05:53,661 --> 00:05:57,654
He's very traditional.
Old-fashioned ideas about women.

58
00:05:57,865 --> 00:06:00,231
Wives must follow certain rules.

59
00:06:00,434 --> 00:06:05,872
Can't speak until spoken to, don't sit
until he does, all that crap.

60
00:06:07,275 --> 00:06:09,004
Meanwhile...

61
00:06:09,277 --> 00:06:13,179
...he keeps a stable of concubines
you wouldn't believe.

62
00:06:17,718 --> 00:06:19,015
Anyway...

63
00:06:20,454 --> 00:06:23,389
...this is a very old-world guy.

64
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:28,756
So watch yourselves, and keep
your wives away from the mai tais.

65
00:06:28,963 --> 00:06:32,922
Okay, a few facts
about the man. Denny...

66
00:06:33,134 --> 00:06:36,297
...show us Yakamoto's
holdings for '85.

67
00:06:38,205 --> 00:06:42,938
Damn. Spreadsheets are still printing.
Machine's been down.

68
00:06:44,245 --> 00:06:47,703
Okay, forget it.
Walter, let's have your report.

69
00:07:00,161 --> 00:07:05,292
Yakamoto Worldwide has shown almost
recession-proof capabilities.

70
00:07:05,499 --> 00:07:09,162
Even in a disastrous third quarter...

71
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:12,062
...his fish oil conglomerate...

72
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:16,174
...bolstered his net worth
by some 27%.

73
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:27,614
Walter, you look like shit.
Where were you last night?

74
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,289
I was here until 3.

75
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,290
This is the money business.
Image is everything.

76
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:36,463
Look at you. This jacket is shit.

77
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:41,624
See, men like Yakamoto don't make
deals with the lint man, here.

78
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:45,670
-Now look at Denny. That's a suit.
-Armani, sir.

79
00:07:45,873 --> 00:07:48,364
-Take a few tips from him.
-Yes, sir.

80
00:07:48,609 --> 00:07:53,103
We'll make a good assistant
portfolio assessor out of you yet.

81
00:07:53,314 --> 00:07:54,975
See you at dinner.

82
00:07:56,484 --> 00:07:59,112
-Who's he bringing?
-I don't know, sir.

83
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,016
God, I hope it's not the embalmer.

84
00:08:21,976 --> 00:08:24,376
-Can I borrow your wife?
-Sure. $50.

85
00:08:24,578 --> 00:08:27,411
I'm serious.
Denise bagged out on me.

86
00:08:27,648 --> 00:08:31,607
I need a date. They don't know
Susie's my sister-in-law.

87
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:35,152
She'd do it, but it's our anniversary.

88
00:08:35,356 --> 00:08:37,688
-Going to Spago's.
-I'm ruined.

89
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,986
Watch this. This guy 'll make an offer.

90
00:08:41,195 --> 00:08:44,653
-Have you decided?
-I can't go higher than 15,500.

91
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,197
No can do. It's 17,000 list.

92
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:50,097
What? You told me it was 18,000 list!

93
00:08:50,371 --> 00:08:55,502
You made $1 000 off your brother? I'm
bankrolling your dinner at Spago's!

94
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,870
Stop it. You're scaring him.

95
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:02,573
You're scaring me. Jesus, you'd
cheat your own flesh and blood.

96
00:09:02,783 --> 00:09:04,375
We'll talk.

97
00:09:06,253 --> 00:09:09,745
-I'll make it up to you.
-You'll write me a check?

98
00:09:09,957 --> 00:09:12,187
No, but I know this fantastic--

99
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:16,760
Stop! You're gonna recommend
one of your psychotic friends.

100
00:09:16,964 --> 00:09:19,023
I resent that, Walter.

101
00:09:19,233 --> 00:09:24,535
You've set me up before, only you
forget to mention one crucial detail:

102
00:09:24,738 --> 00:09:29,072
She's a dopehead, a lesbian,
keeps dead cats in the freezer....

103
00:09:29,276 --> 00:09:33,303
What a New Year's!
''The champagne's in the icebox.''

104
00:09:33,547 --> 00:09:38,450
I'm sorry. Seriously, I know someone.
Nadia Gates, Susie's cousin.

105
00:09:38,652 --> 00:09:43,214
-Ted, I don't want to hear it.
-Don't you trust your own brother?

106
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:47,393
No argument there.
But, no bullshit, Nadia's amazing.

107
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,755
She's just moved back to town...

108
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:53,058
-...and wants to meet people!
-What's she like?

109
00:09:53,267 --> 00:09:57,499
She's a sweetheart, good sense
of humour. You'll love her!

110
00:09:57,738 --> 00:10:01,504
I won't love her
because this won't happen!

111
00:10:01,742 --> 00:10:05,143
Suit yourself.
But I highly recommend her.

112
00:10:05,346 --> 00:10:07,576
Talk about the kiss of death!

113
00:10:10,284 --> 00:10:14,846
-Call us if you change your mind.
-I won't!

114
00:10:20,461 --> 00:10:23,021
Hi. Is Chloe there?

115
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,831
Do you have the rifle range's number?

116
00:10:27,034 --> 00:10:31,971
Never mind. Look, I'll just
call her later. Thanks.

117
00:10:53,227 --> 00:10:55,695
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Is she reasonably pretty?

118
00:10:56,897 --> 00:10:59,957
''Reasonably'' doesn't begin
to describe it.

119
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:04,968
I'm looking at her picture now.
She's an honest-to-God knockout.

120
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:08,869
Ted, just this once, please.
The truth.

121
00:11:09,376 --> 00:11:12,903
Susie, tell Walter Nadia's pretty.

122
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,410
She's very pretty, Walter.

123
00:11:18,586 --> 00:11:21,646
-When was the picture taken?
<i>-Four years ago.</i>

124
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:25,985
Four years? She could've been
disfigured in four years!

125
00:11:26,193 --> 00:11:30,425
-She could've gained 100 pounds!
-She's gorgeous! Stop it!

126
00:11:30,664 --> 00:11:32,256
I almost forgot!

127
00:11:32,499 --> 00:11:36,026
Don't get her drunk.
She loses control completely.

128
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,605
But don't get her drunk. If you do...

129
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,741
...she loses control!

130
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:46,737
Loses her inhibitions,
or she pees on the floor?

131
00:11:47,348 --> 00:11:49,373
What's ''lose control'' mean?

132
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,552
Oh, you know, she gets real wild.

133
00:11:53,454 --> 00:11:56,855
She gets real wild!

134
00:12:02,062 --> 00:12:06,863
All right! I may kill you later,
but I'm doing this now...

135
00:12:07,067 --> 00:12:09,160
...before I change my mind.
Give me the number.

136
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:26,750
-Walter?
-Yeah.

137
00:12:27,888 --> 00:12:29,412
Come on in.

138
00:12:37,331 --> 00:12:39,390
I'll just be a minute.

139
00:12:43,437 --> 00:12:47,339
I hope you don't mind
helping me with my suitcase.

140
00:12:47,574 --> 00:12:51,670
I'm moving out of here.
I'll be staying with a friend.

141
00:12:53,013 --> 00:12:56,915
If you feel like it,
a friend's having an art exhibit.

142
00:12:57,117 --> 00:13:01,144
If we have time before dinner,
maybe we could go?

143
00:13:01,355 --> 00:13:03,346
Yeah, no problem.

144
00:13:03,757 --> 00:13:07,249
Well, here goes, Walter. Ready or not.

145
00:13:07,461 --> 00:13:11,488
Oh, damn it!
This has been going on all night.

146
00:13:12,032 --> 00:13:15,365
There may be some matches over there.

147
00:13:16,036 --> 00:13:17,970
Let me look.

148
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,664
It may be over there.

149
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:22,972
Here.

150
00:13:24,111 --> 00:13:28,946
Now this is a blind date.
Here's your chance to run for it.

151
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,744
Your very last chance.

152
00:13:35,522 --> 00:13:37,752
You missed your chance.

153
00:13:44,498 --> 00:13:45,795
I'm glad.

154
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:07,380
I had no idea.

155
00:14:09,289 --> 00:14:11,348
Do you know this artist?

156
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:16,295
I've met him once.
He's Susie's friend.

157
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:20,057
I mean, coming was her idea.
We can go.

158
00:14:20,501 --> 00:14:23,993
-I don't have any obligation to him.
-No, come on.

159
00:14:24,204 --> 00:14:26,365
We're both adults, aren't we?

160
00:14:27,141 --> 00:14:29,302
I thought I was.

161
00:14:30,177 --> 00:14:33,010
I don't know. Maybe I'm not now.

162
00:14:35,682 --> 00:14:37,741
Can I ask you something?

163
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,754
Yeah, I guess so.

164
00:14:42,823 --> 00:14:47,988
Why didn't you have a date tonight?
Is there something I should know?

165
00:14:48,195 --> 00:14:52,996
I can't imagine why you don't
have a date every night of the week.

166
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:56,600
Know what? I was thinking
the same about you.

167
00:14:56,837 --> 00:15:01,171
-Come on, I'm serious.
-Me too. I was thinking that.

168
00:15:03,544 --> 00:15:05,739
I asked you first.

169
00:15:10,717 --> 00:15:13,743
I stopped dating
about three months ago.

170
00:15:14,021 --> 00:15:16,751
I was involved,
but it didn't work out.

171
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:22,224
Boy, how it didn't work out. So I was
living in Baton Rouge with my mama.

172
00:15:22,596 --> 00:15:26,794
And you're my first date.
But you almost weren't.

173
00:15:27,067 --> 00:15:29,297
Susie talked me into it...

174
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,038
...I'm glad to say.

175
00:15:33,207 --> 00:15:34,970
So how about you?

176
00:15:36,643 --> 00:15:40,773
Well, my date backed out
at the last minute...

177
00:15:41,215 --> 00:15:43,308
...I'm glad to say.

178
00:15:49,223 --> 00:15:51,214
You want some candy?

179
00:15:52,292 --> 00:15:54,783
I'm not much of a candy person.

180
00:15:55,762 --> 00:15:59,163
That's good.
I always was a candy person.

181
00:15:59,433 --> 00:16:03,733
Some people drink,
some people do drugs. I do sugar.

182
00:16:07,307 --> 00:16:09,571
This looks Japanese.

183
00:16:11,445 --> 00:16:14,141
''Master and Concubines''?

184
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,484
It's Yakamoto.

185
00:16:17,751 --> 00:16:20,948
-What is?
-The big business dinner tonight...

186
00:16:21,154 --> 00:16:25,056
...is for this Japanese industrialist
new client of ours.

187
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:29,127
He's old-world Japanese.
His wife's like his slave...

188
00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:31,320
...and he keeps concubines.

189
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:35,263
-You're kidding.
-No. His wife knows all about it.

190
00:16:35,502 --> 00:16:37,936
It's traditional or something.

191
00:16:39,973 --> 00:16:43,636
Tell me something.
Are you into those traditions?

192
00:16:43,844 --> 00:16:49,009
No, I'm actually a
one-concubine kind of guy...

193
00:16:49,683 --> 00:16:51,207
-...actually.
-Good.

194
00:16:52,286 --> 00:16:56,689
So, what was it that made you
break up with this guy?

195
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:00,018
-What do you mean?
-What was he like?

196
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,661
-Psychopath. Like that guy over there.
-What's wrong?

197
00:17:04,464 --> 00:17:08,366
That's him! That's my psychotic
ex-boyfriend David.

198
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:11,736
There. The guy in the goofy bow tie.

199
00:17:12,005 --> 00:17:13,632
He looks okay to me.

200
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,674
He's been chasing me
for three months. I moved twice.

201
00:17:17,945 --> 00:17:22,609
I think he's coming over here!
Watch it. Please just hide.

202
00:17:22,816 --> 00:17:24,374
Just relax.

203
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:30,347
Hello, Nadia.

204
00:17:30,557 --> 00:17:34,493
-David, don't start anything.
-I just want to say hello.

205
00:17:34,728 --> 00:17:36,320
Hi, I'm David.

206
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,693
-Walter.
-She has every reason to be upset.

207
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,666
I was so in love,
I made a total asshole of myself.

208
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:46,896
Apology accepted.
Nice to meet you.

209
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,632
-How long you been dating?
-None of your business!

210
00:17:50,877 --> 00:17:55,246
It is my business.
There's not a night that's gone by--

211
00:17:55,515 --> 00:17:58,814
You son of a bitch,
are you drilling her?!

212
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:01,510
Shut up and leave her alone!

213
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:06,421
Wait, I want to talk to you.
I'll find you!

214
00:18:12,899 --> 00:18:16,335
-I have an idea.
-Yeah? What?

215
00:18:20,941 --> 00:18:22,841
Thank you.

216
00:18:34,354 --> 00:18:38,256
-Okay, Walter, what's going on?
-Well....

217
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,753
We have about half an hour.
Indulge me.

218
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:17,226
-You like guitar?
-Oh, yeah, I do.

219
00:19:18,732 --> 00:19:22,725
<i>-We're set. How's the level for you?</i>
-It's basically cool.

220
00:19:22,936 --> 00:19:27,134
Turn up the monitors a bit
and we'll be there. Thanks.

221
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,400
-How are you?
-Good, Stanley. How are you?

222
00:19:30,977 --> 00:19:33,138
Did you bring your guitar?

223
00:19:34,748 --> 00:19:38,013
No, I brought something better
than a guitar.

224
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:41,583
-How you doing?
-Hi, how are you?

225
00:19:41,822 --> 00:19:43,551
Good, good.

226
00:19:45,525 --> 00:19:49,188
You ever hear him play?
He's really fantastic.

227
00:19:52,365 --> 00:19:53,992
Relax...

228
00:19:54,501 --> 00:19:56,901
...sip a little champagne.

229
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,935
I don't think I should drink.

230
00:20:03,043 --> 00:20:05,910
The last three or four times I ...

231
00:20:06,113 --> 00:20:09,605
I mean, it sort of makes me go crazy!

232
00:20:12,018 --> 00:20:16,717
Well, one little glass
isn't gonna make you go crazy.

233
00:20:22,963 --> 00:20:25,261
This is our first toast.

234
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:29,432
To auspicious beginnings.

235
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:37,203
It's really good.

236
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:41,107
<i>Stanley Jordan, take two. Rolling.</i>

237
00:20:59,266 --> 00:21:02,429
So, what made you think
to stop by here?

238
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:09,071
I recorded here when I thought
I wanted to be a musician.

239
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:14,242
I played guitar. But I really
don't have time for it now.

240
00:21:15,515 --> 00:21:20,976
I played all the time. I went to
the bathroom carrying a Stratocaster.

241
00:21:21,188 --> 00:21:24,919
I drove my mom nuts.
I got tendinitis.

242
00:21:27,961 --> 00:21:29,929
Why did you give it up?

243
00:21:30,997 --> 00:21:32,464
Well....

244
00:21:34,601 --> 00:21:37,934
Because if you want
to be a musician...

245
00:21:38,138 --> 00:21:43,132
...you're guaranteeing yourself
a life of poverty and obscurity...

246
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:46,176
...unless you're talented
like Stanley.

247
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,472
And...

248
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,507
...I got a good job now...

249
00:21:51,818 --> 00:21:55,811
...good car. Next year,
I'll be able to get a condo.

250
00:21:57,824 --> 00:21:59,155
I don't know.

251
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,987
It just kind of made sense.

252
00:22:05,265 --> 00:22:08,462
We're gonna be late.
Let me give you a little--

253
00:22:14,808 --> 00:22:17,208
Oh, I'm getting bad.

254
00:22:17,777 --> 00:22:20,769
I'm starting to feel the champagne.

255
00:22:24,184 --> 00:22:25,947
That's okay.

256
00:22:26,152 --> 00:22:27,881
Feel away.

257
00:22:28,321 --> 00:22:29,481
Come on.

258
00:23:10,697 --> 00:23:14,155
Hi, I called for Davis,
for two, please.

259
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:18,336
-Joseph, table six.
-Follow me, please.

260
00:23:18,538 --> 00:23:23,373
Please don't touch the flowers.
The arrangement is very expensive.

261
00:23:23,576 --> 00:23:27,910
These things don't smell.
They're no good anyway.

262
00:23:29,683 --> 00:23:32,948
-Sorry. Oh, my God.
-It's all right.

263
00:23:33,219 --> 00:23:35,414
-You sure?
-It 'll be fine.

264
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:50,301
-Lovely-looking girl.
-Thank you.

265
00:23:50,537 --> 00:23:52,562
-You know my wife.
-Yes, hello.

266
00:23:52,772 --> 00:23:55,468
Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Gruen.

267
00:24:01,147 --> 00:24:05,709
Thank you. Do you think you could
find me some safety pins?

268
00:24:05,952 --> 00:24:07,783
Safety pins?

269
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,252
No, I don't think so.

270
00:24:11,224 --> 00:24:13,749
There's a lot of roast beef in here.

271
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,623
Would you care for a cocktail?

272
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:22,325
-A bottle of your finest champagne.
-Very good.

273
00:24:22,602 --> 00:24:24,001
Thank you.

274
00:24:26,573 --> 00:24:28,404
Oh, my God.

275
00:24:29,943 --> 00:24:31,171
That's Yakamoto.

276
00:24:34,147 --> 00:24:35,671
Good evening.

277
00:24:36,249 --> 00:24:40,185
-My wife.
-Very nice to meet you, Mr. Yakimoto.

278
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,354
Yakamoto.

279
00:24:44,591 --> 00:24:46,582
Mrs. Yakamoto.

280
00:24:47,127 --> 00:24:49,994
-How lovely you look.
-Thank you.

281
00:24:51,297 --> 00:24:55,666
That's incredible.
She's like a geisha girl.

282
00:25:11,951 --> 00:25:16,820
Cupcake, would you excuse me
for just a minute?

283
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,282
Business.

284
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:27,031
-They still do that in Japan?
-I don't know--

285
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:30,531
Walter, you old dog.

286
00:25:31,538 --> 00:25:35,201
-Denny Gordon, this is Nadia Gates.
-How do you do?

287
00:25:35,475 --> 00:25:39,343
-Hi.
-I gotta hand it to you.

288
00:25:39,546 --> 00:25:43,573
This is the most exciting
woman in the place.

289
00:25:43,817 --> 00:25:46,945
Thank you. Nice tie.
Where did you get it?

290
00:25:47,153 --> 00:25:51,817
I don't remember. Probably
one of those places over on Rodeo.

291
00:25:52,058 --> 00:25:55,994
-Where's that?
-You don't know where Rodeo is?

292
00:25:56,196 --> 00:25:59,927
No, I know where it is.
I just wondered if you did.

293
00:26:03,169 --> 00:26:05,603
What happened to your pocket?

294
00:26:05,905 --> 00:26:09,534
-Oh, we had a little--
-That's the new style.

295
00:26:12,078 --> 00:26:14,546
See? Oh, that looks nice.

296
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:20,583
-Aren't you forgetting your date?
-My date? Oh, right. Yes.

297
00:26:20,753 --> 00:26:24,553
I do hope that we'll meet again.

298
00:26:26,826 --> 00:26:30,227
''Denny Gordon, supervisor,
real estate analysis.''

299
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:33,866
How did you get that?
It fell out of my pocket.

300
00:26:34,067 --> 00:26:37,935
-You pressed it in my hand.
-I don't think I did that.

301
00:26:38,171 --> 00:26:40,833
-You put it right in my hand.
-You see--

302
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:46,273
-Why? Did you think I'd call you up?
-Come on, you know how it is.

303
00:26:46,513 --> 00:26:49,175
No, I don't think
he does know how it is.

304
00:26:49,449 --> 00:26:54,352
He's not a vain slimeball pig
that's led around by his dick.

305
00:26:58,191 --> 00:27:01,422
I guess that just about
sums it up, huh?

306
00:27:03,763 --> 00:27:05,788
AlI's fair in love and....

307
00:27:06,065 --> 00:27:10,024
She's right. You really are
a slimeball pig.

308
00:27:10,236 --> 00:27:14,104
Hey, Denny! Your ex-fiancée,
she just took a hike.

309
00:27:14,307 --> 00:27:15,638
Oh, jeez.

310
00:27:16,743 --> 00:27:17,801
Honey?

311
00:27:18,077 --> 00:27:19,977
Sweetheart!

312
00:27:20,246 --> 00:27:23,306
I'll be right back, sir.
You look lovely.

313
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,744
Thank you.

314
00:27:24,951 --> 00:27:26,043
Pumpkin?

315
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:36,894
-My boss, Mr. Gruen, is watching us.
-Where is he?

316
00:27:45,471 --> 00:27:48,804
-Boy, that was--
-You shouldn't have any more.

317
00:27:50,743 --> 00:27:53,143
-Are you ready?
-Yes, we are.

318
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,513
Will you order for me, please?

319
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,978
We'll start with
the ''etoo-vee-ay de vee-o a''--

320
00:28:09,495 --> 00:28:11,292
Which soup?

321
00:28:12,432 --> 00:28:16,095
We'll have the cream
''du con-cum-be-ray.''

322
00:28:18,171 --> 00:28:20,105
Vegetable?

323
00:28:23,543 --> 00:28:25,670
This one right here.

324
00:28:26,145 --> 00:28:28,272
The <i>gratín dauphinois</i>?

325
00:28:28,781 --> 00:28:33,275
A bit of a clash with the
<i>veau au vin rouge,</i> don't you think?

326
00:28:33,486 --> 00:28:36,978
Excuse me. Come here.
Can I ask you something?

327
00:28:38,324 --> 00:28:43,023
Do you really speak French
or just bullshit menu French?

328
00:28:43,496 --> 00:28:46,260
-I trained in Paris.
-Oh, good.

329
00:28:51,904 --> 00:28:53,201
What did you say?

330
00:28:53,439 --> 00:28:57,808
I told him to stick a skewer
up his ass and flambé himself.

331
00:28:58,011 --> 00:29:00,605
-What did he say?
-He called me a slut.

332
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,440
Now, just a goddamn minute here.

333
00:29:04,851 --> 00:29:06,113
What did he say?

334
00:29:06,352 --> 00:29:09,913
''Your taste in women
is as bad as your French.''

335
00:29:10,189 --> 00:29:12,623
How do you say, ''Step outside''?

336
00:29:17,063 --> 00:29:18,462
This is a....

337
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,625
Excuse me.

338
00:29:23,069 --> 00:29:26,232
I said, ''The champagne
tastes like horse piss.''

339
00:29:26,439 --> 00:29:30,432
He said, ''I should know,''
which is quite a good comeback.

340
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:33,703
-What the hell--?
-Oh, my God!

341
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,411
-I'm sorry.
-What did he say?

342
00:29:36,616 --> 00:29:39,312
I don't know. I don't speak French.

343
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,789
-He insulted my date.
-It's all Henri's fault. He's French.

344
00:29:42,789 --> 00:29:44,950
-He insulted my date.
-It's all Henri's fault. He's French.

345
00:29:46,793 --> 00:29:48,385
Hey, Mr. Y.

346
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:52,290
If you don't mind,
that is the loveliest necklace.

347
00:29:52,498 --> 00:29:55,331
It's so pretty. Where did you get it?

348
00:29:55,535 --> 00:29:57,400
I don't speak English.

349
00:29:57,603 --> 00:30:00,003
He insulted my date, Nadia!

350
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,768
-Oh, my God.
-Go back to your seat.

351
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,638
-She can't talk?
-They're our guests.

352
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:11,215
-I just asked about the necklace.
-You are foolish and silly.

353
00:30:11,451 --> 00:30:14,943
-Leaving so soon? Sit.
-Go jump on your concubine.

354
00:30:15,154 --> 00:30:18,021
Did you hear her?
I have no concubine.

355
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:21,692
Walter, get this woman out of here!

356
00:30:23,396 --> 00:30:25,864
No, no. Don't do that.

357
00:30:27,066 --> 00:30:30,365
Why don't you walk
over there, Nadia? Here.

358
00:30:30,636 --> 00:30:32,331
Oh, take it to her.

359
00:30:33,139 --> 00:30:37,132
I hope this doesn't undermine
your confidence in us.

360
00:30:45,551 --> 00:30:48,748
-I worked very hard for this job.
-We can sort--

361
00:30:49,021 --> 00:30:51,819
-What's going on out here?
-Oh, my God.

362
00:30:52,024 --> 00:30:55,858
-Please, come back to the restaurant.
-Mrs. Gruen, hi.

363
00:30:56,596 --> 00:30:58,154
Mrs. Yakamoto.

364
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:02,095
-She doesn't speak English.
-Just get out of here!

365
00:31:02,368 --> 00:31:05,030
Mrs. Yakamoto, I have your hair.

366
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:09,265
I'm going to just
slip it under the door.

367
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:10,874
Got it?

368
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:15,012
I'll tell your husband
you'll be out in a minute.

369
00:31:17,717 --> 00:31:21,084
Don't take that
concubine stuff from anybody.

370
00:31:21,287 --> 00:31:24,586
-I no speak English!
-You a California resident?

371
00:31:24,791 --> 00:31:27,988
-I no speak English!
-Know what you're entitled?

372
00:31:28,194 --> 00:31:29,957
I no speak English!

373
00:31:30,196 --> 00:31:35,600
California law states you're entitled
to 50% of your husband's assets.

374
00:31:38,638 --> 00:31:40,765
Fifty percent?

375
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:44,971
Mr. Gruen, please. I'm very sorry.
I had no way--

376
00:31:45,211 --> 00:31:47,873
Walter, go away. Just go away.

377
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,073
Bottle of Meyer-Fonné Barsac.
Hors d'oeuvres, on the house?

378
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:57,382
Sir, I can't begin to tell you
how dreadfully sorry l--

379
00:31:57,824 --> 00:31:59,951
Attention! Attention, everybody!

380
00:32:01,928 --> 00:32:05,159
Mrs. Yakamoto needs
a good divorce lawyer now...

381
00:32:05,364 --> 00:32:09,164
...because Mr. Yakamoto
is worth over $100 million.

382
00:32:14,707 --> 00:32:17,073
-Miss.
-I'll kill her!

383
00:32:20,613 --> 00:32:22,103
Harry--

384
00:32:22,782 --> 00:32:24,647
Don't touch me. Please.

385
00:32:24,917 --> 00:32:27,112
Did you hurt yourself?

386
00:32:34,627 --> 00:32:37,152
Do I have to say the words?

387
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:39,898
-I'm fired?
-Fired?

388
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,892
I only wish we were in the Army...

389
00:32:44,103 --> 00:32:48,597
-...so I could have you shot.
-Yes, sir.

390
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,503
Twice.

391
00:32:55,147 --> 00:32:57,980
That was so much fun!

392
00:32:58,451 --> 00:33:02,581
My face is numb.
What do you wanna do now?

393
00:33:03,322 --> 00:33:06,587
There's a party down the street.
Let's go!

394
00:33:06,826 --> 00:33:12,230
Are you insane? You destroyed my life
and now you want to go to a party?

395
00:33:12,498 --> 00:33:16,832
-You don't like me, do you?
-I've never hit a woman before, but--

396
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:19,368
-Let's make up.
-That won't work.

397
00:33:19,572 --> 00:33:22,905
-Of course, it will.
-It won't! Now stop it!

398
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:28,340
-Nadia, I'm driving the car!
-Let's do it! Let's do it right now!

399
00:33:28,581 --> 00:33:32,039
-We're on the freeway!
-Who cares?

400
00:33:33,686 --> 00:33:37,679
I'm driving 55 miles an hour, here!
Will you, for chri--

401
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,555
Stop it!

402
00:33:48,134 --> 00:33:52,468
-Stop, please!
-You're frowning again.

403
00:33:52,705 --> 00:33:57,108
Stop it! For chrissakes,
there's a car behind us!

404
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,073
Gotta do better than that.

405
00:33:59,378 --> 00:34:02,905
Someone's getting out of the car.
Sit over there.

406
00:34:03,149 --> 00:34:05,276
-David!
-What? This is--

407
00:34:05,484 --> 00:34:07,611
-Car trouble?
-You following us?

408
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,914
-I'm worried about her.
-I'm taking her home.

409
00:34:11,123 --> 00:34:16,026
You let her drink? Son of a bitch,
don't you know she can't drink?

410
00:34:16,228 --> 00:34:19,629
-Nadia, get out of the car!
-Stay in the car.

411
00:34:19,899 --> 00:34:24,495
-Hey, that's a-- That's a $500 bra!
-I'm gonna kill you!

412
00:34:24,737 --> 00:34:28,833
You were gonna drill her.
I'll kill you!

413
00:34:29,075 --> 00:34:31,475
Can't we just talk about it?

414
00:34:32,244 --> 00:34:34,007
Honey, stay in the car.

415
00:34:34,246 --> 00:34:37,909
-I'll stay in the car.
-You don't love her like I do!

416
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:41,348
-I believe you!
-He doesn't love you like I do!

417
00:34:41,587 --> 00:34:45,648
What are you doing?
Get out of my car! Hey!

418
00:34:51,197 --> 00:34:53,427
That son of a bitch!

419
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,932
I'm gonna kill you too!

420
00:35:02,208 --> 00:35:04,039
Walter, what--

421
00:35:12,284 --> 00:35:15,515
You son of a bitch, I'll kill you!

422
00:35:16,022 --> 00:35:17,990
Damn bastard!

423
00:35:29,402 --> 00:35:34,305
Jesus, that guy's a maniac.
He was really trying to kill me.

424
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,367
Why'd you break up?

425
00:35:36,575 --> 00:35:40,306
You must be the best match
since Bonnie and Clyde.

426
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:52,180
Come on.

427
00:35:53,893 --> 00:35:55,087
I'm sorry.

428
00:35:56,829 --> 00:35:59,059
I really am. I...

429
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:01,760
It was a cheap shot.

430
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:09,198
-I wasn't crying about that.
-What are you crying about?

431
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:17,206
I just saw David chasing you
around the car, and I got sad.

432
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,211
Me too.

433
00:36:22,321 --> 00:36:24,448
Do you have a Kleenex?

434
00:36:27,193 --> 00:36:29,024
A handkerchief?

435
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:33,827
Here.

436
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:38,302
I hate it when my eyes get all puffy.

437
00:36:38,537 --> 00:36:42,166
I get all stuffed up. I look terrible.

438
00:36:44,677 --> 00:36:46,736
Are my eyes puffy?

439
00:36:50,382 --> 00:36:54,045
Can we stop so I can blow my nose
and wash my face?

440
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:56,585
I gotta go to the bathroom.

441
00:36:56,822 --> 00:36:59,052
Yeah, sure. Okay.

442
00:37:00,993 --> 00:37:02,153
Thank you.

443
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:54,203
-Can I help you?
-Fill it with unleaded.

444
00:37:54,413 --> 00:37:56,881
-Super?
-Regular.

445
00:37:58,584 --> 00:38:00,415
Let me say two words:

446
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:04,453
Engine knocks. Rings and valves,
$900. Check, please.

447
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:08,650
You can pay me now
or pay my service manager later.

448
00:38:08,894 --> 00:38:11,727
-Fill it with unleaded.
-Super?

449
00:38:11,931 --> 00:38:13,922
The guy wants super.

450
00:38:24,243 --> 00:38:26,143
-She's not in there.
-What?

451
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:30,338
The girl who came with you?
She's at Freda & Freddie's.

452
00:38:30,816 --> 00:38:32,681
The disco.

453
00:39:01,447 --> 00:39:03,813
Where's the ladies' room?

454
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:06,715
Thank you very much.

455
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:40,312
I'm looking for my date.

456
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:44,478
She's a brunette with a red dress on,
really pretty.

457
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:49,525
And she came in
the bathroom here and, see--

458
00:39:49,728 --> 00:39:52,925
She was in the bathroom
at the gas station.

459
00:39:53,165 --> 00:39:57,226
She took a long time.
I went to get her and she was gone.

460
00:39:57,436 --> 00:40:00,496
And the gas station guy said...

461
00:40:03,008 --> 00:40:07,775
...that she came in here.
I figured she went into this--

462
00:40:08,681 --> 00:40:12,048
I'll wait right here
at the bar for her, okay?

463
00:40:12,251 --> 00:40:17,018
Bartender, can I get
a Perrier and a soda? I mean--

464
00:40:17,222 --> 00:40:20,191
A Scotch and soda.
Something like that.

465
00:40:20,392 --> 00:40:21,950
Can I buy you a drink?

466
00:40:22,227 --> 00:40:26,960
She had a thing with her ex,
and she got a little emotional.

467
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:31,033
She started crying and wanted
to stop at a gas station.

468
00:40:31,236 --> 00:40:33,204
So we stopped next door.

469
00:40:33,439 --> 00:40:37,705
She took a long time.
When I went to get her, she'd left.

470
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:42,870
The guy said she came here.
She probably went into this bathroom.

471
00:40:43,082 --> 00:40:48,486
It wasn't like I was trying to
look in. I was trying to find her.

472
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:51,221
Come dance with me.

473
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:55,951
-This is the girl. Right here.
-Five dollars, please.

474
00:41:00,733 --> 00:41:05,295
-I know you're a good dancer.
-No, I really don't wanna dance.

475
00:41:06,972 --> 00:41:10,669
-Stop, it's not funny.
-Come on.

476
00:41:10,976 --> 00:41:13,103
I'm sorry.

477
00:41:15,481 --> 00:41:17,449
Let's just go.

478
00:41:18,317 --> 00:41:21,480
Please. I'm sorry.

479
00:42:28,353 --> 00:42:30,878
All right, you ready for this?

480
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:43,265
-Let's go now.
-Please, Walter.

481
00:43:14,399 --> 00:43:18,802
-Hi, I just wanted to come by and--
-David, don't--

482
00:43:19,037 --> 00:43:23,633
I came by to apologize.
I still love her very much.

483
00:43:23,842 --> 00:43:27,403
What? So you can drill her?
You son of a bitch!

484
00:43:39,725 --> 00:43:41,955
You bitch!

485
00:43:46,231 --> 00:43:48,358
We're leaving. Now!

486
00:43:52,905 --> 00:43:55,840
You son of a bitch!

487
00:44:04,316 --> 00:44:07,308
Let's go before the cops show up.

488
00:44:08,754 --> 00:44:10,813
Come on, come on!

489
00:44:12,324 --> 00:44:14,383
Move it, move it, move it.

490
00:44:16,995 --> 00:44:19,361
Get in. Get in!

491
00:44:20,332 --> 00:44:21,492
How much?

492
00:44:21,733 --> 00:44:23,826
-Cash or plastic?
-Cash!

493
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:27,164
It's $17.50.
What's going on over there?

494
00:44:27,372 --> 00:44:30,432
I wanna talk to you.
Get out of the car.

495
00:44:30,676 --> 00:44:33,167
Just get out of the--

496
00:44:34,246 --> 00:44:37,704
Get back inside, you stupid idiot!

497
00:44:50,862 --> 00:44:55,265
Your ex's hobby is killing people.
What's his profession?

498
00:44:56,068 --> 00:45:00,630
-He's a defence lawyer.
-For who? Jack the Ripper?

499
00:45:00,872 --> 00:45:02,931
It's not funny.

500
00:45:04,109 --> 00:45:07,772
I'm taking you home.
Where do your friends live?

501
00:45:08,046 --> 00:45:12,745
They live on Elm and East Hill.

502
00:45:12,951 --> 00:45:16,387
Your friends live
on Elm and East Hill?

503
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:18,579
No, the party.

504
00:45:19,558 --> 00:45:22,118
I'm not taking you to any party!

505
00:45:22,327 --> 00:45:23,988
Party!

506
00:45:25,831 --> 00:45:28,391
I'm gonna take you home.

507
00:45:28,734 --> 00:45:30,099
To Baton Rouge?

508
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:35,936
I'm taking you to your friends' house.
Where do they live?

509
00:45:36,308 --> 00:45:40,836
-We have to get on the freeway.
-No! No more freeways.

510
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:44,845
It's the only way I know
how to get there.

511
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:51,154
-What's the exact address?
-I know the house.

512
00:45:56,662 --> 00:45:59,756
-I'm getting on the freeway.
-Where's the hole?

513
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:02,695
But if you make one move--
You listening?

514
00:46:02,934 --> 00:46:05,960
If you make one move
that makes me nervous...

515
00:46:06,171 --> 00:46:10,130
...I'll put you out at the first
intersection. Understand?

516
00:46:10,542 --> 00:46:12,533
Don't frown, Walter.

517
00:46:13,879 --> 00:46:17,645
Here's the house. Right....

518
00:46:19,384 --> 00:46:22,842
Okay, here, stop. Right here.

519
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:34,724
When was the last time
you saw these people?

520
00:46:34,933 --> 00:46:36,924
About six years.

521
00:46:37,436 --> 00:46:38,664
Listen to me.

522
00:46:38,904 --> 00:46:41,737
Listen. Listen to me.

523
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:45,143
You absolutely sure this is the house?

524
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,335
Absolutely.

525
00:46:49,448 --> 00:46:51,109
Jesus!

526
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:07,632
Hey! Stop! Get out of there!
Come here a minute!

527
00:47:17,976 --> 00:47:19,876
Your beautiful car.

528
00:47:23,548 --> 00:47:27,951
Look at the bright side.
What the hell else could happen?

529
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:38,154
-Nadia, just stay out of this.
-Shut up, bitch!

530
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:39,887
Your wallet.

531
00:47:41,967 --> 00:47:45,801
-Oh, shit! The cops!
-Drop the gun!

532
00:47:51,343 --> 00:47:53,311
There was three girls.

533
00:47:53,512 --> 00:47:58,347
One of the girls put a gun to my head!
She had a knife in my crotch!

534
00:47:58,617 --> 00:48:01,313
Get out of the freaking car!

535
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:04,589
One had red hair standing straight up.

536
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:08,624
Both had leather jackets,
and one had a big tattoo!

537
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:14,459
How much did you drink tonight, sir?

538
00:48:38,023 --> 00:48:39,320
Good.

539
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:41,383
Head back.

540
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:43,691
Eyes closed.

541
00:48:43,895 --> 00:48:45,795
Arms out.

542
00:48:45,997 --> 00:48:47,794
Palms up.

543
00:48:47,999 --> 00:48:51,491
With your left hand,
touch the tip of your nose.

544
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:53,298
Good.

545
00:48:53,505 --> 00:48:55,530
Now the other hand.

546
00:48:57,742 --> 00:49:00,404
Now, keep your eyes closed.

547
00:49:00,645 --> 00:49:04,513
Raise your right foot
eight inches for 10 seconds.

548
00:49:16,127 --> 00:49:18,994
God, I feel horrible.

549
00:49:19,631 --> 00:49:22,293
Dare I hope that you sobered up?

550
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:25,325
Oh, I drank. I drank so much.

551
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:28,405
Yes, you did.

552
00:49:30,275 --> 00:49:34,177
And the dinner party.... Oh, God.

553
00:49:34,412 --> 00:49:37,347
-Walter, I'm so sorry.
-Well...

554
00:49:37,816 --> 00:49:40,444
...I know I feel a lot better now.

555
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:48,619
I just have this chemical imbalance.

556
00:49:48,827 --> 00:49:54,129
It's like an allergy to alcohol.
It makes me crazy, that's all.

557
00:49:54,966 --> 00:49:56,263
Is that so?

558
00:49:58,336 --> 00:50:03,433
Look, Walter, I know you hate me.
So just listen.

559
00:50:04,109 --> 00:50:07,135
Take me to my friend Cathy's house.

560
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:12,207
I know the address.
I won't ever bother you again.

561
00:50:17,022 --> 00:50:19,013
I'll kill you!

562
00:50:19,257 --> 00:50:20,519
Great!

563
00:50:20,725 --> 00:50:24,252
-I thought we'd lost him!
-What fun would that be?

564
00:50:25,997 --> 00:50:27,760
-David!
-Hold the tray!

565
00:50:37,876 --> 00:50:42,108
You son of a bitch! You wanna play?
Fine, I'll kill you!

566
00:50:53,625 --> 00:50:57,721
Actually, if you'll just
drop me off at the nearest hotel--

567
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:02,696
-And end this glorious evening?
-I told you I was sorry.

568
00:51:02,901 --> 00:51:06,632
It's barely midnight.
Don't you wanna boogie down?

569
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:10,404
Dance all night? Tear up the town?

570
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:14,241
I just wanna lie down
in a nice, cool place.

571
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:17,472
I just remembered! There's a party!

572
00:51:17,716 --> 00:51:21,812
I know somebody mentioned
a party at Elm and East Hill.

573
00:51:22,053 --> 00:51:25,022
I don't wanna go to a party anymore.

574
00:51:25,557 --> 00:51:29,653
My friends are nice, quiet people.
They'll bore you.

575
00:51:29,861 --> 00:51:33,160
We'll just have to
liven them up, won't we?

576
00:51:42,407 --> 00:51:44,500
Seen some traffic, pal?

577
00:51:46,611 --> 00:51:49,341
-Walter, listen to me.
-What?

578
00:51:49,581 --> 00:51:51,572
Party pooper.

579
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:58,280
-Please, Walter.
-This is great.

580
00:52:03,461 --> 00:52:06,794
-How are you?
-Walter Davis, rocket scientist.

581
00:52:08,466 --> 00:52:10,127
I'm thirsty.

582
00:52:10,368 --> 00:52:11,801
Thank you.

583
00:52:12,103 --> 00:52:14,537
Walter Davis, gynaecologist.

584
00:52:17,242 --> 00:52:21,201
-I know these people.
-Great! Let's mingle.

585
00:52:34,959 --> 00:52:37,086
You can't juggle pâté.

586
00:52:37,662 --> 00:52:38,788
Oh, my God!

587
00:52:38,997 --> 00:52:42,933
-You came after all.
-Walter Davis, interior decorator.

588
00:52:43,134 --> 00:52:48,162
-Did you do the Leland house?
-We did the upstairs in '60s kitsch.

589
00:52:48,406 --> 00:52:52,900
-Beanbag chairs, lava lamps. Amazing.
-We have to go there now.

590
00:52:53,111 --> 00:52:55,409
That's a great suit, Grant.

591
00:53:04,322 --> 00:53:07,917
106 at the Forum,
24 seconds left in the game.

592
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:11,651
Lakers down by one.
Magic pumps, shoots.

593
00:53:12,997 --> 00:53:15,864
Lakers win in overtime, folks!

594
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:17,694
Boston fans?

595
00:53:17,902 --> 00:53:20,268
Do I hear a mambo?

596
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:21,903
Come on, Nadia.

597
00:53:25,009 --> 00:53:27,569
It's mambo time!

598
00:53:30,515 --> 00:53:32,574
Listen to me!

599
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:40,088
Come and dance with me, darling.

600
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:51,758
Walter Davis, brain surgeon.

601
00:53:52,637 --> 00:53:55,538
Walter Davis, mambo king!

602
00:53:57,776 --> 00:54:01,644
-Mambo with me, darling!
-Would you care for another--

603
00:54:04,949 --> 00:54:08,441
I hope Walter and Nadia
are having a good time.

604
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:18,084
You lie down in a quiet room,
and I'll call a cab.

605
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:22,630
What is all this? I thought
you were Ms. Party-All-Night.

606
00:54:22,834 --> 00:54:25,325
This is a great fucking party!

607
00:54:27,505 --> 00:54:29,939
You'll thank me in the morning.

608
00:54:34,078 --> 00:54:35,875
Let's do it.

609
00:54:36,414 --> 00:54:41,249
Let's do it in the coats!
Right here in the fur coats, honey.

610
00:54:41,786 --> 00:54:46,587
Why don't you do now what you're
going to do later anyway?

611
00:54:46,925 --> 00:54:48,449
Just pass out.

612
00:54:48,927 --> 00:54:51,361
Come to me, baby!

613
00:54:59,704 --> 00:55:04,368
Nadia, my little minx.
You've come back to me.

614
00:55:04,642 --> 00:55:07,975
You can't get rid of me that easily.

615
00:55:10,315 --> 00:55:12,374
I'm gonna rip your head off!

616
00:55:18,489 --> 00:55:22,755
So I take her to my house,
watch a movie, kicking back.

617
00:55:23,061 --> 00:55:25,052
She's about this tall.

618
00:55:25,263 --> 00:55:27,356
Sort of like that one.

619
00:55:31,069 --> 00:55:32,161
Can I help you?

620
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:35,897
I need my suitcase out of here.
I called a cab.

621
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:46,544
-I wanna talk to you!
-Hey, go call somebody.

622
00:55:46,751 --> 00:55:49,242
I'm gonna freaking kill you!

623
00:55:52,790 --> 00:55:54,257
Get up, you big--

624
00:55:57,228 --> 00:55:58,855
Call them!

625
00:56:08,606 --> 00:56:10,267
-Walter, no!
-Shut up!

626
00:56:10,475 --> 00:56:12,306
-I'm not worth it.
-Shut up!

627
00:56:12,644 --> 00:56:13,838
-Dance!
-What?

628
00:56:14,045 --> 00:56:15,706
I said dance, scumbag!

629
00:56:21,219 --> 00:56:22,208
Moonwalk!

630
00:56:27,325 --> 00:56:28,815
I hate that shit!

631
00:56:31,396 --> 00:56:33,364
He's got a gun!

632
00:56:47,245 --> 00:56:49,440
Step up to the line, sir.

633
00:56:54,719 --> 00:56:56,186
Hands over your head.

634
00:56:56,754 --> 00:56:59,416
Straighten up. Look straight ahead.

635
00:57:08,433 --> 00:57:12,563
Here. You're allowed two phone calls.

636
00:57:21,946 --> 00:57:26,406
My brother was just
in a serious accident. I ...

637
00:57:26,617 --> 00:57:30,917
-What do you drive? I have a car--
-Have a nice day.

638
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:52,405
Buckle up, Walter.
You're in enough trouble.

639
00:57:53,244 --> 00:57:55,144
It's the law!

640
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:00,315
Home?

641
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:05,947
I warned you not to let her drink.

642
00:58:08,593 --> 00:58:13,963
You'd better get a good lawyer
or you'll go to jail for a long time.

643
00:58:17,335 --> 00:58:20,168
You're lucky you didn't kill anybody.

644
00:58:26,611 --> 00:58:27,839
Bad hangover?

645
00:58:30,681 --> 00:58:32,842
Serves you right.

646
00:58:34,519 --> 00:58:36,180
New car?

647
00:58:41,859 --> 00:58:43,292
God!

648
00:58:51,869 --> 00:58:54,963
-Sorry about your car.
-Just get out.

649
00:59:00,144 --> 00:59:04,046
-Thanks for bailing me out.
-I didn't bail you out.

650
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:13,684
-Teddy, what did you say?
-I said I didn't bail you out.

651
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:16,155
-Well, who did?
-Nadia.

652
00:59:16,394 --> 00:59:18,919
What?! Wait a second!

653
00:59:30,041 --> 00:59:33,101
-You smashed my rear window!
-Where is she?

654
00:59:33,377 --> 00:59:38,371
-For chrissakes, she's staying with us!
-I want you to take me to her.

655
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:52,191
-She didn't go to her friend's.
-Where is she?

656
00:59:52,396 --> 00:59:53,886
It's only 7:30!

657
00:59:54,098 --> 00:59:57,727
-I'm feeling sick again.
-She's in the guest room.

658
00:59:58,069 --> 01:00:00,799
-What is it?
-He wants to talk to Nadia.

659
01:00:01,038 --> 01:00:05,270
-But it's only 7:30.
-Look, Walter's out of control.

660
01:00:43,915 --> 01:00:45,678
Can you hear me?

661
01:00:46,484 --> 01:00:49,851
-Yes. Who are you?
-It's Walter.

662
01:00:52,990 --> 01:00:56,153
Walter, are you dead?
God, you look dead.

663
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:59,261
How much do I owe you for my bail?

664
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:05,100
I don't wanna be obligated
to you for anything.

665
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:10,599
Tell me how much I owe you.
I'll go home and write you a check.

666
01:01:10,841 --> 01:01:14,868
-Can we discuss this later?
-I don't have much time.

667
01:01:15,513 --> 01:01:18,175
-Don't shout.
-I wasn't shouting.

668
01:01:18,382 --> 01:01:23,217
I know. I thought you were going to,
and I couldn't stand it.

669
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:32,921
I go to court a week from this Friday.

670
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:36,725
After that, I'm told
I'll probably go to jail...

671
01:01:36,968 --> 01:01:38,697
...for at least two years.

672
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:43,533
I'd rather kill myself
than have you visit me in jail.

673
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:46,141
So tell me how much I owe you...

674
01:01:46,344 --> 01:01:49,745
...and then I never
wanna see you again.

675
01:02:01,192 --> 01:02:04,355
Ten thousand dollars!

676
01:02:08,899 --> 01:02:12,232
Now get out of here,
you ungrateful monster.

677
01:02:12,436 --> 01:02:13,994
Ungrateful?

678
01:02:14,205 --> 01:02:16,196
I'm ungrateful?

679
01:02:17,541 --> 01:02:21,568
I should be grateful after
what you did to me last night?

680
01:02:21,779 --> 01:02:24,748
After what I did?
What did I do to you?

681
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:28,112
You did a lot of things,
to a lot of people.

682
01:02:28,352 --> 01:02:32,516
I just happened to be a part of it.
A big part, I recall.

683
01:02:32,723 --> 01:02:35,886
-You got me drunk.
-I didn't get you drunk.

684
01:02:36,093 --> 01:02:40,189
-You bought the champagne.
-You didn't have to drink it!

685
01:02:40,398 --> 01:02:44,391
That's a cheap shot, Walter.
A real cheap shot.

686
01:02:44,602 --> 01:02:48,470
I drank it because you
seemed sweet and generous.

687
01:02:48,706 --> 01:02:51,436
Somebody I could fall in love with.

688
01:02:54,278 --> 01:02:58,374
I thought you were special.
I really did.

689
01:02:58,582 --> 01:03:00,948
I'm sorry you got fired.

690
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:05,919
I'm sorry you got arrested.
But you know why I'm most sorry?

691
01:03:06,123 --> 01:03:08,853
I'm sorry that you're not so special.

692
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:12,154
That you're mean and self-pitying...

693
01:03:12,396 --> 01:03:15,888
...and that you don't give
a damn about how I feel.

694
01:03:16,133 --> 01:03:18,761
And I feel shitty, Walter!

695
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:25,502
Oh, God.

696
01:03:34,452 --> 01:03:36,477
Where you going?

697
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:40,457
Want me to drive--? You want a cab?

698
01:03:47,965 --> 01:03:49,489
You're right.

699
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:53,500
Without a great lawyer,
he'll probably go to prison.

700
01:03:53,771 --> 01:03:56,706
He's planning on defending himself.

701
01:03:57,842 --> 01:04:00,276
He'll definitely go to prison.

702
01:04:03,981 --> 01:04:05,642
Will you defend him?

703
01:04:06,484 --> 01:04:08,213
Why would I do that?

704
01:04:09,019 --> 01:04:12,785
Because you're greatly responsible,
that's why.

705
01:04:15,159 --> 01:04:19,027
You do have a point.
I am greatly responsible.

706
01:04:19,964 --> 01:04:21,158
Not good enough.

707
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:26,726
If you do, I'll live with you.

708
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:31,371
Still not good enough.

709
01:04:32,543 --> 01:04:36,377
-Okay. Goodbye.
-I'll defend him on one condition.

710
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:38,241
What's that?

711
01:04:39,683 --> 01:04:41,674
Marry me.

712
01:04:43,754 --> 01:04:48,157
I feel guilty about what I did
to Walter, but not that guilty.

713
01:04:48,359 --> 01:04:53,490
Possession of an illegal firearm.
Assault with intent to commit murder.

714
01:04:53,697 --> 01:04:56,257
Ten years, minimum.

715
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:15,980
-Yes, Lupa.
<i>-Miss Gates wishes to see you again.</i>

716
01:05:16,187 --> 01:05:18,747
-Have her wait.
<i>-Yes, sir.</i>

717
01:05:24,962 --> 01:05:27,226
You should know this up front.

718
01:05:27,798 --> 01:05:32,292
I don't like you anymore.
And I certainly don't love you.

719
01:05:32,703 --> 01:05:34,295
I don't blame you.

720
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:37,737
Do we have to have sex?

721
01:05:45,583 --> 01:05:46,914
But no kissing.

722
01:05:51,388 --> 01:05:56,792
All rise. Court is now in session.
Judge Harold Bedford presiding.

723
01:05:57,595 --> 01:05:58,687
Be seated.

724
01:06:04,735 --> 01:06:06,396
Mr. Walter Davis.

725
01:06:10,774 --> 01:06:13,174
Thank you. Yes, Your Honour.

726
01:06:14,778 --> 01:06:18,578
I understand you refuse
to be represented by counsel.

727
01:06:18,782 --> 01:06:19,942
That's correct.

728
01:06:20,284 --> 01:06:24,277
Are you suicidal, Mr. Davis,
or just plain stupid?

729
01:06:25,589 --> 01:06:28,615
Probably a bit of both, sir.
Your Honour.

730
01:06:28,826 --> 01:06:30,259
I see.

731
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:34,862
Mr. Davis, it would be a humongous
understatement to tell you...

732
01:06:35,132 --> 01:06:38,659
...how passionately I disapprove
of your actions.

733
01:06:38,869 --> 01:06:42,270
In fact, I'd be equally
critical of a physician...

734
01:06:42,506 --> 01:06:46,943
...planning to perform
brain surgery on himself.

735
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:51,178
-Yes, Your Honour.
-''Yes, Your Honour'' doesn't do it.

736
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:55,113
Let the public defender
handle your case.

737
01:06:55,319 --> 01:06:59,119
-That won't be necessary, Your Honour.
-Oh, shit.

738
01:07:00,691 --> 01:07:06,129
-Sorry I'm late. I got it from here.
-Mr. Davis, would you explain this?

739
01:07:06,363 --> 01:07:09,025
I'll represent Mr. Davis, Your Honour.

740
01:07:09,233 --> 01:07:13,829
I was speaking to Mr. Davis!
I was under the impression....

741
01:07:14,038 --> 01:07:18,168
-What are you doing?
-I'm doing this as a favour to Nadia.

742
01:07:18,375 --> 01:07:22,869
-Ensuring I go to the gas chamber?
-If you're not calm, I can't help.

743
01:07:23,147 --> 01:07:28,380
-Please don't let this man help me!
-Order in the court!

744
01:07:30,854 --> 01:07:34,722
One more outburst,
and I'll hold you in contempt.

745
01:07:36,026 --> 01:07:40,986
-You all right, Agnes?
-Yes, Your Honour, I'm all right.

746
01:07:43,267 --> 01:07:46,828
Will counsel please
approach the bench?

747
01:07:47,938 --> 01:07:49,735
Hey! Your--

748
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:51,271
This is--

749
01:07:53,677 --> 01:07:55,406
What the hell's going on?

750
01:07:55,913 --> 01:07:59,940
Not complicated. I decided
he shouldn't defend himself.

751
01:08:00,184 --> 01:08:03,745
-Bullshit. What's on your face?
-I was in a fight.

752
01:08:03,954 --> 01:08:06,422
-With whom?
-Mr. Davis.

753
01:08:08,859 --> 01:08:11,555
-I don't want complications.
-Since when?

754
01:08:11,962 --> 01:08:13,930
I offer you a proposition.

755
01:08:14,131 --> 01:08:17,965
-If you find my defendant innocent--
-Stop.

756
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:22,462
You're crazy, trying to bribe
a superior court judge.

757
01:08:22,706 --> 01:08:26,039
I'll stop practising law
in your jurisdiction.

758
01:08:27,277 --> 01:08:30,872
-I don't believe you.
-I swear on Mother's grave.

759
01:08:31,115 --> 01:08:35,176
-Your mom's playing golf at Bel Air.
-I meant future tense.

760
01:08:35,386 --> 01:08:40,790
-Go out of state. Say, Alaska?
-My heart's set on somewhere tropical.

761
01:08:40,991 --> 01:08:45,052
-Change your name.
-Not practical. I'm getting married.

762
01:08:45,329 --> 01:08:49,663
You could honeymoon for
five or six years. All expenses paid.

763
01:08:49,933 --> 01:08:53,630
-I don't think that would--
-I won't press my luck.

764
01:08:53,904 --> 01:08:56,498
-One more thing.
-I knew it.

765
01:08:56,740 --> 01:09:01,677
The wedding's at your house.
Invite all your influential friends.

766
01:09:01,912 --> 01:09:06,679
If I practice law in another state,
I want to drop some big names.

767
01:09:06,917 --> 01:09:08,908
-Anything else?
-That's it.

768
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:14,082
I'll be breaking the law for
the first time, but it's worth it.

769
01:09:15,459 --> 01:09:16,756
Thanks, Dad.

770
01:09:18,195 --> 01:09:21,289
-Jesus.
-Sorry, Your Honour.

771
01:09:25,836 --> 01:09:28,100
What did you tell him? What?

772
01:09:28,305 --> 01:09:32,969
You can't railroad me into jail
so you can have a shot at Nadia!

773
01:09:33,177 --> 01:09:35,771
-Quiet!
-Don't believe him! He's crazy!

774
01:09:35,979 --> 01:09:38,641
-He's trying to steal my girl!
-Order!

775
01:09:38,849 --> 01:09:42,512
Order in the goddamn court!
Sorry, Agnes.

776
01:09:43,954 --> 01:09:47,856
I find the defendant not guilty.
Case dismissed.

777
01:09:48,325 --> 01:09:53,422
-Take a 20-minute recess.
-All rise. Twenty-minute recess.

778
01:09:53,630 --> 01:09:55,530
Congratulations.

779
01:09:56,133 --> 01:09:59,227
-What happened?
-You're a free man.

780
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:04,037
-Now you can congratulate me.
-What for?

781
01:10:04,408 --> 01:10:07,138
Nadia and I are getting married.

782
01:10:08,078 --> 01:10:10,911
And you're the one
who made it possible.

783
01:10:18,322 --> 01:10:21,416
-Where's Nadia?
-Baton Rouge, telling her mom.

784
01:10:21,658 --> 01:10:27,028
In the last few days my reality
has been tested to the limits, but--

785
01:10:27,231 --> 01:10:30,723
-Telling her mom what?
-She said to give you this.

786
01:10:37,608 --> 01:10:40,600
You are so lucky.
Why are you so unhappy?

787
01:10:40,844 --> 01:10:43,870
You guys go ahead.
I'm gonna walk a while.

788
01:10:49,586 --> 01:10:51,577
<i>''Dearest Walter:</i>

789
01:10:52,389 --> 01:10:54,516
<i>You may not believe it...</i>

790
01:10:54,758 --> 01:10:58,159
<i>...but I am sorry</i>
<i>for the trouble I caused you.</i>

791
01:10:58,362 --> 01:11:02,458
<i>I hope someday you'll find it</i>

792
01:11:02,699 --> 01:11:07,796
<i>You're a special person, Walter,</i>
<i>and I'll miss you a lot.</i>

793
01:11:08,038 --> 01:11:09,733
<i>Love, Nadia.</i>

794
01:11:10,374 --> 01:11:14,242
<i>Oh, P.S. I hope you start</i>
<i>playing the guitar again.''</i>

795
01:11:39,436 --> 01:11:41,597
<i>-Hello.</i>
<i>-Susie, it's Nadia.</i>

796
01:11:41,805 --> 01:11:46,105
<i>-Hi, where are you?</i>
<i>-Still in Baton Rouge. How's Walter?.</i>

797
01:11:47,578 --> 01:11:52,072
<i>He seemed pretty good</i>
<i>when I talked to him on the phone.</i>

798
01:11:52,282 --> 01:11:55,911
<i>He asked about you.</i>
<i>I told him you were...</i>

799
01:11:56,119 --> 01:12:00,146
<i>-...deliriously happy. Did I lie?</i>
<i>-No.</i>

800
01:12:00,357 --> 01:12:05,659
Oh, honey. Just get out of this thing.
You're just gonna ruin your life.

801
01:12:05,929 --> 01:12:09,763
<i>I can't. I know it sounds crazy,</i>
<i>but I made a deal.</i>

802
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,128
<i>Look, I'll call you</i>
<i>when I get in. Bye.</i>

803
01:12:13,337 --> 01:12:15,703
-Who's that?
-It's Nadia.

804
01:12:15,939 --> 01:12:17,497
How is she?

805
01:12:18,442 --> 01:12:20,842
She's deliriously happy.

806
01:12:37,628 --> 01:12:40,324
-What is it, darling?
-Air.

807
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:43,624
The air here's so wonderful.
I just love it.

808
01:12:54,645 --> 01:12:56,840
What, no merry-go-round?

809
01:12:57,047 --> 01:13:00,244
You promised David
a first-class wedding.

810
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:05,085
-A wedding, not Disney World.
-Don't be a shitheel, Harold.

811
01:13:05,322 --> 01:13:08,553
Your only son doesn't
get married every day.

812
01:13:08,759 --> 01:13:12,855
He's your son too.
It's time you take half the blame.

813
01:13:13,063 --> 01:13:17,159
-Mom! Dad!
-See? He even gives you top billing.

814
01:13:20,003 --> 01:13:23,200
Your soon-to-be daughter-in-law.

815
01:13:23,407 --> 01:13:24,999
-Hello.
-How do you do?

816
01:13:25,208 --> 01:13:29,042
-Well, let me show you to your room.
-Okay, fine.

817
01:13:32,449 --> 01:13:34,383
What do you think?

818
01:13:34,584 --> 01:13:37,849
She isn't at all
what I thought she'd be.

819
01:13:38,088 --> 01:13:40,249
What did you think she'd be?

820
01:13:40,457 --> 01:13:42,186
Blind.

821
01:13:48,131 --> 01:13:50,463
Plan to have children?
Naturally.

822
01:13:50,701 --> 01:13:54,432
-I know what to get you for a present.
-What's that?

823
01:13:54,638 --> 01:13:56,401
A vasectomy.

824
01:14:09,753 --> 01:14:14,247
The house is far too large
for us without David here...

825
01:14:14,458 --> 01:14:18,485
...but we're so emotionally attached.
We bought it in 1953...

826
01:14:18,729 --> 01:14:21,789
...the year after
Harold became a judge.

827
01:14:22,299 --> 01:14:25,325
-It's lovely.
-Thank you, my dear.

828
01:14:25,802 --> 01:14:28,896
Where are you and David
planning on living?

829
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:35,445
We haven't really decided yet.
I think David likes San Francisco.

830
01:14:37,114 --> 01:14:41,244
I thought you had in mind
something more tropical.

831
01:14:41,451 --> 01:14:46,616
We really haven't decided on
a place yet. Miami, maybe. Honolulu.

832
01:14:46,823 --> 01:14:50,987
-I understand you're from the South?
-Louisiana.

833
01:14:51,228 --> 01:14:56,131
I love the South. I played
the front nine at Augusta once.

834
01:14:56,566 --> 01:15:00,093
-Did you let Rambo out?
-Yes, sir.

835
01:15:05,842 --> 01:15:08,936
Jesus Christ.
Good doggie. Nice doggie.

836
01:15:09,446 --> 01:15:11,004
Oh, shit.

837
01:15:15,052 --> 01:15:17,043
She's lovely.

838
01:15:19,389 --> 01:15:21,016
And bright.

839
01:15:22,959 --> 01:15:25,951
To marry him,
she must have a screw loose.

840
01:15:28,331 --> 01:15:31,027
What is that dog barking about?

841
01:15:35,372 --> 01:15:36,464
Jordan.

842
01:15:55,492 --> 01:15:57,153
Rambo! Shut up!

843
01:15:57,594 --> 01:16:00,654
You'll wake up
the whole neighbourhood!

844
01:16:37,067 --> 01:16:38,728
-Rambo!
-Jordan!

845
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:41,301
-Yes, sir?
-What's with that dog?

846
01:16:41,538 --> 01:16:44,405
-I don't know, sir.
-Do something!

847
01:16:44,808 --> 01:16:48,801
Come here, Rambo.
What the hell's got into you?

848
01:16:50,714 --> 01:16:54,548
Stop that! You keep quiet
or I'll call the vet...

849
01:16:54,751 --> 01:16:59,711
...and he'll cut them off
and you'll bark like Cyndi Lauper.

850
01:17:02,092 --> 01:17:03,457
Help!

851
01:17:03,727 --> 01:17:05,820
Somebody open the door!

852
01:17:20,443 --> 01:17:21,910
Rambo, shut up!

853
01:17:22,112 --> 01:17:26,344
-Rambo, shut up!
-Jordan, shut up!

854
01:17:26,583 --> 01:17:28,380
Come on, Rambo.

855
01:17:32,122 --> 01:17:34,920
I want you to be quiet, you hear me?

856
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:38,593
What the hell are you doing?

857
01:17:38,795 --> 01:17:41,730
Planting corn!
What the hell do you think?

858
01:17:51,808 --> 01:17:54,709
I can't stand him. He's an idiot.

859
01:17:54,978 --> 01:17:58,038
Let's go back to bed
and forget him, okay?

860
01:17:58,281 --> 01:18:01,114
Maybe if we think hard, he'll go away.

861
01:18:01,318 --> 01:18:04,287
If he leaves me this house,
I'll sell it.

862
01:18:04,588 --> 01:18:06,385
Tomorrow, yes.

863
01:18:10,794 --> 01:18:12,159
Good night.

864
01:18:13,330 --> 01:18:15,093
Miserable mutt!

865
01:18:15,265 --> 01:18:17,893
-Would you like some hot cocoa?
-No.

866
01:18:18,068 --> 01:18:22,300
Rambo can protect us
when the neighbours try to lynch us.

867
01:19:03,647 --> 01:19:05,877
I'm gonna kill that damn dog.

868
01:19:12,722 --> 01:19:14,622
What the hell was that?

869
01:19:21,598 --> 01:19:24,431
Oh, it must have been the wind.

870
01:19:25,135 --> 01:19:27,330
There's no wind.

871
01:19:28,338 --> 01:19:29,999
-What?
-What?

872
01:19:32,809 --> 01:19:34,242
Great.

873
01:19:38,548 --> 01:19:42,075
Darling, my door's locked.
I guess the wind....

874
01:19:42,419 --> 01:19:44,410
David, it won't work.

875
01:19:44,621 --> 01:19:45,781
Now good night!

876
01:19:49,926 --> 01:19:51,257
Great.

877
01:20:19,055 --> 01:20:23,822
<i>Here's Johnny!</i>

878
01:20:41,945 --> 01:20:43,537
You all right, Agnes?

879
01:20:50,687 --> 01:20:54,623
Look at me!
I'll have to take another shower.

880
01:20:54,858 --> 01:20:57,258
I hate this! Jesus!

881
01:20:58,261 --> 01:20:59,751
Walter?

882
01:21:30,593 --> 01:21:32,925
It's not funny, David.

883
01:21:37,801 --> 01:21:39,996
Jesus.

884
01:21:48,411 --> 01:21:50,902
Plant seeds in my pocket.

885
01:21:52,582 --> 01:21:54,812
Great. I'm filthy.

886
01:22:22,278 --> 01:22:24,838
Why, what did you do that for?

887
01:22:33,356 --> 01:22:37,452
There you are, you filthy beast.
How did you get out?

888
01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:41,323
Right. Come on.
Back in the pen you go.

889
01:22:47,570 --> 01:22:50,061
You gonna move or aren't you?

890
01:23:23,506 --> 01:23:25,974
-What's that?
-It's for Miss Gates.

891
01:23:26,175 --> 01:23:27,767
I'll take it.

892
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:31,947
Why's he so happy?

893
01:23:32,148 --> 01:23:36,983
Hard to say. Last time he acted
like that, he'd run over the cat.

894
01:23:48,798 --> 01:23:51,892
Hello. Good morning.

895
01:23:52,168 --> 01:23:56,798
-You look very happy, David.
-So do you, darling.

896
01:23:57,006 --> 01:23:59,668
This is for you.

897
01:24:05,081 --> 01:24:06,548
Love you!

898
01:25:00,203 --> 01:25:04,401
Nadia, do you mind
if I eat this last chocolate?

899
01:25:04,607 --> 01:25:06,404
Sure, Mama.

900
01:25:09,078 --> 01:25:11,603
These are filled with brandy.

901
01:25:15,752 --> 01:25:18,220
You didn't eat this whole box?

902
01:25:18,421 --> 01:25:19,945
I didn't?

903
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:46,308
Shut up. Shut up!

904
01:26:32,061 --> 01:26:33,323
Dearly beloved...

905
01:26:33,529 --> 01:26:37,021
...we are gathered here
in this beautiful home...

906
01:26:37,233 --> 01:26:39,201
...on this beautiful day...

907
01:26:39,469 --> 01:26:43,064
...to witness the uniting
of two beautiful souls...

908
01:26:43,272 --> 01:26:45,206
...in holy wedlock.

909
01:26:45,408 --> 01:26:47,933
Marriage is a sacred commitment...

910
01:26:48,144 --> 01:26:52,274
...designed on Earth
and sanctified in heaven.

911
01:26:52,482 --> 01:26:55,076
Without the institution
of marriage...

912
01:26:55,251 --> 01:26:58,243
...mankind would still be
in the Dark Ages.

913
01:26:58,488 --> 01:27:01,821
Consider the marriage symbol,
the wedding ring.

914
01:27:02,024 --> 01:27:05,016
A perfect circle,
without beginning or end...

915
01:27:05,228 --> 01:27:08,220
...signifying God's
eternal love and devotion.

916
01:27:08,731 --> 01:27:12,565
For where would we be
without God's love?

917
01:27:22,445 --> 01:27:23,434
Cheap shoes.

918
01:27:25,281 --> 01:27:26,873
You all right, Agnes?

919
01:27:29,252 --> 01:27:33,916
And let us be ever mindful
of the consequences of our acts.

920
01:27:34,123 --> 01:27:36,114
God is watching.

921
01:27:37,627 --> 01:27:40,528
Oh, Lord, she did eat them all.

922
01:27:41,063 --> 01:27:42,792
Have you been drinking?

923
01:27:45,134 --> 01:27:46,692
The time has come...

924
01:27:46,936 --> 01:27:50,565
...for David and Nadia
to make this commitment.

925
01:27:50,773 --> 01:27:54,641
Do you, David,
take Nadia to be your wife?

926
01:27:54,844 --> 01:27:58,473
-I haven't finished. To have and to--
-I do.

927
01:27:58,681 --> 01:28:02,117
--in sickness and health,
till death do you part?

928
01:28:02,318 --> 01:28:04,786
-Do you, Nadia, take David--
-Wait.

929
01:28:05,021 --> 01:28:07,854
Is it indelicate
to ask what's going on?

930
01:28:08,090 --> 01:28:11,856
-I don't love your son.
-Me neither. What's your point?

931
01:28:12,094 --> 01:28:15,928
-Take deep breaths.
-Screw the guests!

932
01:28:16,132 --> 01:28:21,434
-This will take time. Have champagne.
-I know we had a bargain.

933
01:28:21,671 --> 01:28:25,505
-Play some music, and kill the dog!
-Honey--

934
01:28:25,775 --> 01:28:27,709
What's this about a bargain?

935
01:28:27,944 --> 01:28:31,038
People shouldn't marry
because of a bargain.

936
01:28:33,082 --> 01:28:35,550
Would you just--
Come back here and finish this!

937
01:28:37,453 --> 01:28:39,546
Stop the music!

938
01:28:43,993 --> 01:28:48,327
Ladies and gentlemen,
maybe you can help me with this one.

939
01:28:50,299 --> 01:28:53,325
Say two people are gonna be married...

940
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:56,566
...and one doesn't love the other one.

941
01:28:57,373 --> 01:29:00,672
The other only thinks
he loves the other one...

942
01:29:00,877 --> 01:29:04,176
...because the other one
really loves another.

943
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:05,779
Are you with me?

944
01:29:08,451 --> 01:29:12,478
If two people don't love each other
should they get married?

945
01:29:13,189 --> 01:29:14,781
There you go.

946
01:29:15,057 --> 01:29:19,255
-If one adored the other one...
-But she didn't love him!

947
01:29:19,462 --> 01:29:22,727
...would die for her,
she'd learn to love him.

948
01:29:22,965 --> 01:29:27,163
But she loves another man
and would always think of him.

949
01:29:27,370 --> 01:29:31,033
-Not if he's dead! Not now, Father!
-Would any of you--

950
01:29:32,408 --> 01:29:34,968
Hold it. Hold it.

951
01:29:35,344 --> 01:29:39,212
The only way to get this resolved
is to take a vote.

952
01:29:39,415 --> 01:29:42,111
All those in favour
of Nadia and David...

953
01:29:42,318 --> 01:29:46,049
...not getting married, say ''aye.''

954
01:30:33,035 --> 01:30:35,629
Nadia! Get your mouth away from him!

955
01:30:35,805 --> 01:30:39,639
Listen to me! Nadia!
Get your hands off of him!

956
01:30:40,305 --> 01:30:46,369
