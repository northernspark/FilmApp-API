Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,300
Dia.

4
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,775
English boys don't go
to school every day.

5
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
BLOOD DIAMOND

6
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,530
Teacher say this country
was founded as a utopia.

7
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:54,265
Do you know
what that word means, Papa?

8
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,810
Well, she says someday
when the war is over...

9
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,380
...our world will be a paradise.

10
00:02:59,545 --> 00:03:01,915
And all this you learn in one day?

11
00:03:02,085 --> 00:03:04,210
And math and science.

12
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:08,455
This is too much learning. Tomorrow,
you will stay home and mend the nets, yes?

13
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:09,750
No, Papa.

14
00:03:09,925 --> 00:03:12,220
What? So now you want
to go to school every day?

15
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,150
- Stay.
- Papa.

16
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,725
- Stay!
- Papa!

17
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,390
Jassie!

18
00:04:26,935 --> 00:04:28,425
Solomon.

19
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,115
Come, come, come.

20
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,220
Pick it up. Quick.

21
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:53,650
- Papa! Papa!
- Jassie.

22
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,730
- Dia, run!
- Papa!

23
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:03,895
- Papa! Papa!
- Dia, run!

24
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,165
Papa!

25
00:05:22,425 --> 00:05:24,390
Bring forward the next one. Bastard.

26
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,220
Bring forward the next one.

27
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,330
- Long sleeve or short sleeve?
- No.

28
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,330
Young man. You must understand.

29
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,165
The government wants you to vote, okay?

30
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:41,000
They gonna tell you say,
"The future is in your hands."

31
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,405
We now the future.

32
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,170
So we take your hands.

33
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:47,780
- No.
- No more hands, no more voting.

34
00:05:50,018 --> 00:05:51,280
Chop him.

35
00:05:54,956 --> 00:05:58,892
Spread the word.
The Revolutionary United Front is coming.

36
00:06:00,428 --> 00:06:04,728
- RUF!
- RUF! RUF!

37
00:06:06,568 --> 00:06:10,231
Bring forward the next one.
Bring him forward. Bring him forward.

38
00:06:12,907 --> 00:06:15,034
Long sleeve or short sleeve?

39
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:17,943
- Short sleeve!
- Chop him.

40
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,472
Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait.

41
00:06:22,784 --> 00:06:24,308
Not this one. Look at him.

42
00:06:25,286 --> 00:06:26,810
- Put him in the truck.
- Let's go.

43
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:28,387
Bring him to the mines.

44
00:06:28,556 --> 00:06:30,717
He can work. He can work.
Move, move, move.

45
00:06:30,892 --> 00:06:32,655
Next one, next one, next one.

46
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,826
Throughout the history of Africa...

47
00:06:40,301 --> 00:06:42,531
...whenever a substance
of value is found...

48
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:47,238
...the locals die
in great number and in misery.

49
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:53,111
Now, this was true of ivory,
rubber, gold and oil.

50
00:06:53,281 --> 00:06:54,680
It is now true of diamonds.

51
00:06:56,751 --> 00:07:00,312
According to a devastating report
by Global Witness...

52
00:07:00,488 --> 00:07:05,323
...these stones are being used
to purchase arms and finance civil war.

53
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:08,291
We must act to prohibit...

54
00:07:08,463 --> 00:07:12,797
...the direct or indirect import
of all rough diamonds from conflict zones.

55
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,429
May I remind you...

56
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:25,545
...that the U.S. is responsible for two-thirds
of all diamond purchases worldwide...

57
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:29,308
...and I don't anticipate
that demand diminishing.

58
00:07:29,884 --> 00:07:31,715
We must remember
that these stones...

59
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:36,846
...comprise only a small percentage
of the legitimate diamond industry...

60
00:07:37,025 --> 00:07:41,894
...whose trade is crucial to the economies
of many emerging nations.

61
00:07:42,063 --> 00:07:45,328
The Freetown government
and their white masters...

62
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,128
...have raped your land
to feed their greed.

63
00:07:48,303 --> 00:07:50,396
RUF have freed you.

64
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:53,904
- No more slave and master here.
- It's true.

65
00:07:54,075 --> 00:07:59,172
Current estimates are that conflict stones
account for only 15 percent of the market.

66
00:07:59,347 --> 00:08:01,747
But in a multi-billion-dollar-a-year
industry...

67
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,976
...that means hundreds of millions
of dollars are available...

68
00:08:05,153 --> 00:08:07,053
...for weapons in these conflict zones.

69
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:09,689
RUF is fighting for the people!

70
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:12,621
RUF is fighting for Sierra Leone!

71
00:08:12,794 --> 00:08:17,663
Any bastard think he would joke
with me diamond, I go cut he throat.

72
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:20,993
Stop!

73
00:08:22,203 --> 00:08:26,435
And we are joined today
by members of that diamond industry...

74
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:30,240
...who wholeheartedly
endorse your proposal.

75
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:34,074
I hope you join me
in applauding their presence here.

76
00:08:34,248 --> 00:08:37,513
Mr. Van De Kaap and Mr. Simmons.

77
00:08:46,427 --> 00:08:48,122
Give it to me.

78
00:09:21,696 --> 00:09:24,961
Don't worry. We'll be fine, huh?

79
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:29,502
Listen. You take off
as soon as I'm out the door.

80
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,104
You don't land
until I raise you on the sat phone.

81
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:34,936
You be careful, Danny.

82
00:09:35,109 --> 00:09:39,637
Don't worry. They want these guns
too much to do anything stupid.

83
00:09:53,494 --> 00:09:55,519
Where is Commander Zero?

84
00:09:57,698 --> 00:09:59,859
I am Captain Rambo.

85
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:04,267
Right. Right, I've seen your films, huh?

86
00:10:07,475 --> 00:10:09,909
I'm looking for Commander Zero, huh?

87
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:11,908
He's inside. You talk to me.

88
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,048
You are here to help us
in our struggle against the government.

89
00:10:15,216 --> 00:10:17,776
I'm here to do business
with Commander Zero, all right?

90
00:10:34,202 --> 00:10:35,601
All right.

91
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:40,002
You are the man, huh?
You are the man.

92
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,338
Here, huh?

93
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,359
Hey. I'm talking to you! Stop!

94
00:10:59,527 --> 00:11:01,586
- Commander Zero.
- Hey.

95
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:04,424
- I go kill you, eh?
- It's fine, huh? It's fine.

96
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:08,228
Commander Zero. Commander Zero.

97
00:11:08,402 --> 00:11:11,428
Mr. Archer, come here.

98
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:20,208
You get something for me?

99
00:11:20,381 --> 00:11:22,975
And yourself get something for me, huh?

100
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:27,449
Are you craze?
You get for pay me first for them.

101
00:11:45,907 --> 00:11:47,397
This no fine, huh?

102
00:11:47,575 --> 00:11:48,940
This no fine.

103
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:57,416
...and their new weapons, huh?

104
00:11:57,585 --> 00:11:59,883
Maybe I could kill you
and take what you bring.

105
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:01,954
Then you get one more dead body...

106
00:12:02,123 --> 00:12:04,785
...instead of airplane
way full with grenade launchers.

107
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,955
So I'm think I'm gonna go
to them government.

108
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:10,563
Them government,
at least them go pay me, huh?

109
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:13,598
Wait, wait. Wait, my friend.

110
00:12:17,672 --> 00:12:19,936
This is the thing you want? Here.

111
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:22,268
So many I not know
what to do with them all.

112
00:12:22,877 --> 00:12:25,937
Hey, Archer, next time,
you bring satellite TV, eh?

113
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:28,877
- I wanna see Baywatch.
- Yeah.

114
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,517
Yeah. Yeah.

115
00:12:54,475 --> 00:12:55,965
Hello, hello, hello.

116
00:12:57,378 --> 00:12:59,107
Papers, please.

117
00:12:59,513 --> 00:13:01,504
Danny Archer, National Geographic.

118
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:06,216
You crossing into Liberia.

119
00:13:06,387 --> 00:13:10,016
I've got a letter from the minister of interior
and a Liberian visa as well.

120
00:13:10,191 --> 00:13:12,659
I'm doing a story on the Marrakaz,
who, as you know...

121
00:13:12,827 --> 00:13:16,160
...are allowed to cross the border
in order to get into grazing grounds.

122
00:13:16,631 --> 00:13:18,656
You ever read National Geographic, huh?

123
00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:02,371
- You're under arrest for smuggling.
- No, no, no.

124
00:14:02,543 --> 00:14:05,239
Listen here, my friend.
Listen here, all right?

125
00:14:05,413 --> 00:14:07,881
I am good friends
with Colonel Coetzee.

126
00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:12,351
Colonel Coetzee would not be pleased
that you've interfered with his business.

127
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,249
Now, you know who I am, all right?

128
00:14:14,422 --> 00:14:17,289
You don't wanna make trouble for me
or my friends, all right?

129
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:21,155
Now, look, why don't I just
look the other way, all right?

130
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:24,957
You take one or two of those stones
and get something lacquer for the wife...

131
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:28,966
...or maybe the mistress, all right?
We'll solve the problem right here, huh?

132
00:14:29,704 --> 00:14:32,400
We'll go back to Freetown
and ask Colonel Coetzee...

133
00:14:32,573 --> 00:14:35,565
...how he wishes
to thank his business associate.

134
00:14:35,743 --> 00:14:37,404
Guys, take him away.

135
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:26,288
Hey! What the fuck?
What's going on there?

136
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,325
Come on! Fix that shit now!

137
00:15:28,496 --> 00:15:31,761
Wasting my time here!
What in the shit is that?

138
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:35,593
Fuck that stuff! Fix that shit!
Damn, now need to work.

139
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,704
- Can't work. What's going on there?
- Boss.

140
00:15:37,872 --> 00:15:40,739
- Fix that thing.
- I wanna go toilet. I must go now, now.

141
00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:44,207
- I can't hold it in, boss.
- Go, go.

142
00:15:44,545 --> 00:15:46,513
Get to work. Go to work, go to work.

143
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,776
Fuckheads wasting my time now.
How am I work in this shit?

144
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,557
Stop!

145
00:15:59,627 --> 00:16:01,561
Spread your fingers.

146
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,129
Open.

147
00:16:19,547 --> 00:16:21,310
Make it quick.

148
00:16:57,218 --> 00:16:58,913
Give it to me.

149
00:17:01,622 --> 00:17:03,214
Give it to me.

150
00:17:03,924 --> 00:17:05,892
The government troops are coming!

151
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,431
Go, go, go--!

152
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:45,863
No, no, no!

153
00:17:46,033 --> 00:17:48,729
No! I'm not a rebel!

154
00:18:27,241 --> 00:18:30,108
RUF is coming! RUF is coming!

155
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:34,213
RUF is coming! RUF is coming!
RUF is coming!

156
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:38,511
RUF is coming! RUF is coming!
RUF is coming!

157
00:18:38,686 --> 00:18:42,952
RUF is coming! RUF is coming!
RUF is coming!

158
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,621
RUF! RUF! RUF!

159
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:54,597
RUF! RUF! RUF!

160
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:57,168
RUF! RUF! RUF!

161
00:18:57,338 --> 00:18:59,806
RUF! RUF! RUF!

162
00:19:05,713 --> 00:19:07,078
Hey.

163
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:09,649
What did you do with it?

164
00:19:09,817 --> 00:19:11,944
I'm talking to you, you hear me?

165
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,548
Where the diamond? The pink one.

166
00:19:16,724 --> 00:19:19,488
- I saw you take it.
- You're mad. I do not know you.

167
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:23,596
Liar! I saw it with my own eyes.

168
00:19:24,465 --> 00:19:28,401
This big. Biggest I have ever seen.

169
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:33,169
My brothers, I go give $1000...

170
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,798
...to the man who cuts the diamond
out of this bastard.

171
00:19:36,977 --> 00:19:40,435
You the craze! You the craze!

172
00:19:40,614 --> 00:19:42,241
Where is the diamond?

173
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:45,613
Where is the diamond?
Do you see a diamond?

174
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:51,556
You devils have taken my family!
My home! I done lost everything!

175
00:19:52,326 --> 00:19:55,887
Here, look. What is left?

176
00:19:56,063 --> 00:19:57,963
What is left?

177
00:19:58,132 --> 00:20:00,794
If there is a diamond,
you are the one who has taken it!

178
00:20:00,968 --> 00:20:02,936
Liar! The man is a liar!

179
00:20:03,604 --> 00:20:07,370
I know your name, Solomon Vandy!
You have a name!

180
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:11,637
You have a family!
And I'll catch them!

181
00:20:11,812 --> 00:20:13,609
And I'll find them!

182
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:33,593
Please tell me you brought me
cigarettes, bru, please.

183
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:35,200
I just have to tell you, Danny.

184
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:38,395
The colonel's not going to be happy
about you losing the diamonds.

185
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:41,439
Forget the colonel.
There's a fisherman in there, all right?

186
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:44,236
He might've found a pink. Big one.

187
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:46,538
What about the colonel?
He'll want that stone.

188
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:49,181
Screw the colonel.
I'll contact our friends in London.

189
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:53,183
If this stone is as big as I think,
we're gonna need a real buyer, all right?

190
00:20:53,654 --> 00:20:56,452
What? What?

191
00:20:56,623 --> 00:20:59,319
London wants nothing more
to do with you.

192
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:04,024
"Arrest in Sierra Leone of Daniel Archer,
former mercenary and smuggler..."

193
00:21:04,198 --> 00:21:06,826
"Retains close ties
to Van De Kaap diamond cartel.

194
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,128
Sources say they deny
any affiliation whatso--"

195
00:21:10,304 --> 00:21:12,397
Fucking hell.

196
00:21:13,874 --> 00:21:15,967
Listen, his name
is Solomon Vandy, all right?

197
00:21:16,143 --> 00:21:19,806
Van De Kaap is gonna want that stone,
whatever they say. You just get him out.

198
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,572
Get him out.

199
00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:29,487
Yeah, can you tell Mr. Simmons
that Danny Archer called. Right.

200
00:21:29,923 --> 00:21:33,654
Archer. A-R-C-H-E-R.

201
00:21:57,818 --> 00:21:59,479
Afternoon, darling, huh?

202
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:03,555
Big white man all alone.
That is no fine.

203
00:22:03,724 --> 00:22:08,184
- I'm safe, huh? No HIV.
- Yeah, yeah. I've heard that one before.

204
00:22:08,362 --> 00:22:11,627
Archer, I know where to get
nice baby diamond just for you.

205
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:13,698
- Not now, next time.
- Come on, Archer.

206
00:22:13,867 --> 00:22:16,165
I said not now, next time. Bugger off.

207
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,188
Solomon Vandy?

208
00:23:11,191 --> 00:23:13,056
What do you want?

209
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:16,094
It seems you made a friend in prison.

210
00:23:41,188 --> 00:23:43,418
- Hey.
- How the body, Mr. Archer?

211
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,387
The body fine, M'Ed.

212
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:52,360
So you want something nice, huh?

213
00:23:52,966 --> 00:23:55,730
The best you can get ahold of, all right?

214
00:23:55,902 --> 00:23:59,429
Take me a few days,
but I go find you something special.

215
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:02,439
All right. You hear
they took Marampa yesterday?

216
00:24:03,644 --> 00:24:05,111
- Really?
- Now, come on.

217
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,941
You know every move they make.
When are they gonna hit us?

218
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:12,552
Oh, I imagine they come
do some shopping very soon.

219
00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:15,950
Yeah, yeah.
Got any smokes back there?

220
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:17,681
Yeah.

221
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:28,596
Who's that, huh?

222
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,428
All right.

223
00:24:38,011 --> 00:24:41,640
- Can I offer you a cigarette?
- Oh, no, thanks.

224
00:24:41,882 --> 00:24:43,474
You listening to this?

225
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:46,118
I am profoundly sorry.

226
00:24:46,286 --> 00:24:49,847
The world is falling apart,
and all we hear about is Blowjobgate.

227
00:24:50,691 --> 00:24:51,919
I believe he's sorry.

228
00:24:52,092 --> 00:24:55,493
When was the last time the world
wasn't falling apart, huh?

229
00:24:57,564 --> 00:25:01,432
A cynic. Why don't you sit down
and make me miserable?

230
00:25:03,937 --> 00:25:06,132
- Danny Archer.
- Maddy Bowen.

231
00:25:06,306 --> 00:25:08,103
- Pleased to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

232
00:25:08,475 --> 00:25:10,909
- American, huh?
- Guilty.

233
00:25:11,078 --> 00:25:13,342
Well, Americans usually are.

234
00:25:13,814 --> 00:25:16,214
Says the white South African?

235
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,241
I'm from Rhodesia.

236
00:25:21,088 --> 00:25:23,579
We say Zimbabwe now,
don't we?

237
00:25:23,757 --> 00:25:27,022
- Do we?
- Last time I checked.

238
00:25:27,194 --> 00:25:29,355
Don't tell me,
you're here to make a difference.

239
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:32,760
- And you're here to make a buck?
- I'm here for lack of a better idea.

240
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,397
- That's a shame.
- Not really.

241
00:25:35,569 --> 00:25:37,833
Peace Corps types only
stay around long enough...

242
00:25:38,004 --> 00:25:39,904
...to realize they're not helping anyone.

243
00:25:40,073 --> 00:25:41,938
Government only wants
to stay in power...

244
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:45,010
...until they've stolen enough
to go into exile somewhere else.

245
00:25:45,178 --> 00:25:47,806
And the rebels, they're not sure
they want to take over.

246
00:25:47,981 --> 00:25:50,313
Otherwise,
they'd have to govern this mess.

247
00:25:50,484 --> 00:25:52,782
- But TIA, right, M'Ed?
- TIA.

248
00:25:52,953 --> 00:25:54,181
What's TIA?

249
00:25:54,821 --> 00:25:58,723
- "This is Africa," huh?
- Right.

250
00:25:59,292 --> 00:26:01,760
- You want another?
- Sure.

251
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:08,090
So which one are you?

252
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:12,834
- Smuggler?
- Am I?

253
00:26:13,006 --> 00:26:15,941
Somehow you don't strike me
as the UNICEF type.

254
00:26:16,977 --> 00:26:18,945
How about soldier of fortune?

255
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:21,973
Or is that too much of a cliché?

256
00:26:22,149 --> 00:26:23,480
Diamonds?

257
00:26:24,184 --> 00:26:27,779
- If I told you I was a missionary...?
- For Van De Kaap?

258
00:26:29,489 --> 00:26:32,083
Better watch that type of talk,
Miss Bowen.

259
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:35,353
In America, it's bling-bling,
but out here, it's bling-bang, huh?

260
00:26:35,629 --> 00:26:38,757
I wouldn't want you
getting in any trouble.

261
00:26:40,033 --> 00:26:42,297
How much trouble
do you think I would get into...

262
00:26:42,469 --> 00:26:45,734
...for talking about blood diamonds?

263
00:26:48,542 --> 00:26:51,602
- You're a journalist.
- That's right.

264
00:26:55,549 --> 00:26:57,141
Piss off, huh?

265
00:27:01,488 --> 00:27:04,753
For five years, this country has reported
almost no diamond exports...

266
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:08,588
...while Liberia, right next door,
has exported 2 billion dollars' worth.

267
00:27:08,762 --> 00:27:11,788
Very odd, considering that Liberia
has no diamonds to speak of.

268
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:12,954
I'm shocked.

269
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:16,466
Van De Kaap denies trading blood
diamonds, but admits it's impossible...

270
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:20,970
...to tell where a diamond comes from
unless their smuggler gets caught.

271
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:22,836
What do you want from me, huh?

272
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:27,537
You know all about Van De Kaap.
Help me out. Off the record.

273
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:32,241
Well, off the record, I like to get kissed
before I get fucked, huh?

274
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:36,015
Shit.

275
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:12,848
- Cordell. How is it, Shona?
- Long time, pal.

276
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:16,393
- How's Alice?
- She's well, thanks.

277
00:28:16,563 --> 00:28:18,394
Tim must be in school, right?

278
00:28:18,565 --> 00:28:20,897
- Big kids, big problems, you know?
- Yeah, yeah.

279
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:23,661
I heard you got into a spot of trouble
in the bush, huh?

280
00:28:23,837 --> 00:28:26,237
Well, you know the bush, right, bru?

281
00:28:27,007 --> 00:28:29,567
- Company doing well?
- Can't complain.

282
00:28:29,743 --> 00:28:32,371
Eleven wars in the continent.
We're keeping busy.

283
00:28:32,546 --> 00:28:34,980
So, what, you're here on holiday, huh?

284
00:28:36,683 --> 00:28:38,583
- How's the colonel?
- He sends his regards.

285
00:28:38,752 --> 00:28:42,449
Good, good. Score us a loose, huh?

286
00:28:43,557 --> 00:28:45,752
Smoking will kill you, bru.

287
00:28:46,026 --> 00:28:47,254
Only if I live, right?

288
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:54,499
That's for breaking my TV, bru.

289
00:28:59,372 --> 00:29:02,899
Tell the colonel he'll get his money.
I'll come see him soon.

290
00:29:09,649 --> 00:29:10,877
Ten more.

291
00:29:11,051 --> 00:29:13,952
Come. Come.

292
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,550
Go on.

293
00:29:35,742 --> 00:29:39,678
Dia. Dia. Come here.
Get away from there.

294
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,942
Go. Go, Mama.

295
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:45,050
Stay down.

296
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:04,830
Excuse me,
my name's Solomon Vandy--

297
00:30:05,005 --> 00:30:07,098
- Check the list.
- I have checked the list.

298
00:30:07,273 --> 00:30:11,733
- File papers at the Office for Refugees.
- Sir, I have filed papers with the office.

299
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:13,902
Then God help you,
because I can't.

300
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,138
- Please, sir--
- Next.

301
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:17,442
- Sir-- Sir, no, please.
- Hey, hey. Me, me, me.

302
00:30:17,617 --> 00:30:21,383
Husband here. One year we look.

303
00:30:25,892 --> 00:30:28,053
Hurry, Mom. Go.

304
00:30:33,233 --> 00:30:34,598
Dia! Dia!

305
00:30:34,768 --> 00:30:35,757
- Jassie!
- Dia!

306
00:30:35,935 --> 00:30:37,527
- Mama!
- Dia!

307
00:30:37,704 --> 00:30:39,865
Jassie! Mama!

308
00:31:02,128 --> 00:31:04,961
He's been waiting.
What took you?

309
00:31:05,665 --> 00:31:09,032
What are you gonna do,
shoot me right here, huh, Shona?

310
00:31:09,202 --> 00:31:12,296
Now, don't be a wanker, man. Get in.

311
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:46,770
- Hello, Danny.
- Colonel.

312
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,737
You look well.

313
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:52,071
Clean living and a pure heart,
I suppose, huh?

314
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:54,107
Walk with me.

315
00:31:55,882 --> 00:31:58,715
It seems the rebels have taken back
the diamond fields, Danny.

316
00:31:58,885 --> 00:32:01,217
The government
of Sierra Leone has contracted us...

317
00:32:01,387 --> 00:32:03,355
...to go in there
and take the rebels down.

318
00:32:03,523 --> 00:32:05,115
So you sell the rebels weapons...

319
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:07,953
...the government hires you
when they use them? Nice, sir.

320
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:11,295
I assume you're asking
for mining concessions, huh?

321
00:32:11,464 --> 00:32:14,592
We save the government,
they show their gratitude.

322
00:32:14,768 --> 00:32:17,066
And you get rich, right?

323
00:32:21,374 --> 00:32:22,932
How long have I known you, Danny?

324
00:32:23,376 --> 00:32:26,539
I was... I was 19, sir.

325
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:31,308
And you survived.
A lot of boys didn't. Why is that?

326
00:32:32,719 --> 00:32:35,381
Just lucky, I guess.

327
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:42,159
No, you were a good soldier.
But I made you better, didn't I?

328
00:32:45,532 --> 00:32:46,965
Yes, sir. Yes, you did.

329
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:50,159
And over the years,
didn't I protect you...

330
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:54,529
...teach you about diamonds,
cut you in on the deals?

331
00:32:54,707 --> 00:32:58,370
- Some might call it that, yeah.
- But not you...

332
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:03,008
...because you done with me now, eh?
On to bigger things.

333
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:08,620
I need a man that knows
his way around up there.

334
00:33:08,788 --> 00:33:12,554
Unless, of course,
you wanna cut me in. Something pink?

335
00:33:13,626 --> 00:33:15,150
Sir...

336
00:33:15,328 --> 00:33:17,455
Our deal went bad,
and you owe me money.

337
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:19,359
I'll take a stone as payment.

338
00:33:19,532 --> 00:33:23,400
Look, do you think if I found a stone
like that, I'd still be on this continent?

339
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:27,404
- Come on.
- Danny, give me your hand.

340
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:34,141
That's red earth. It's in our skin.

341
00:33:34,614 --> 00:33:37,014
The Shona say the color
comes from all the blood...

342
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:39,743
...that's being spilled
fighting over the land.

343
00:33:41,788 --> 00:33:46,350
This is home.
You'll never leave Africa.

344
00:33:49,128 --> 00:33:51,790
If you say so, sir.

345
00:34:07,313 --> 00:34:10,942
So, what did you do, bury it?

346
00:34:12,151 --> 00:34:15,712
Yeah. Yeah, I would have
buried it, huh?

347
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:19,916
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about? Come on, bru.

348
00:34:20,093 --> 00:34:21,526
I'm late for work.

349
00:34:21,694 --> 00:34:24,219
Pink, huh? The biggest one
he'd ever seen.

350
00:34:24,397 --> 00:34:26,524
You were in the mining camps,
weren't you, bru?

351
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:30,191
Why else would that rebel with
the bandaged arm make up such a story?

352
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:32,600
Go ask him.

353
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,148
Thank you.

354
00:34:57,797 --> 00:35:00,595
Your mothers and fathers,
your brothers and sisters are dead.

355
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:02,632
- You are dead! You have been reborn.
- No!

356
00:35:02,802 --> 00:35:06,033
- We are your family now.
- No! No!

357
00:35:13,913 --> 00:35:16,245
Your parents are weak.

358
00:35:16,816 --> 00:35:21,253
They're the farmers.
They're the fishermen.

359
00:35:21,754 --> 00:35:25,315
They've done nothing
but suck the blood from this country.

360
00:35:26,693 --> 00:35:31,153
But you are the heroes
who will save this nation.

361
00:35:31,431 --> 00:35:33,399
You are not children anymore.

362
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,334
You're men.

363
00:35:38,538 --> 00:35:41,701
No one has ever given you respect...

364
00:35:41,874 --> 00:35:44,968
...but with this in your hand,
they go fear you.

365
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:47,635
If you do not get
the respect you deserve...

366
00:35:47,814 --> 00:35:50,112
...you will take it
by shedding their blood.

367
00:35:50,283 --> 00:35:54,242
- Repeat after me, shed their blood.
- Shed their blood.

368
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:57,480
- Louder! Shed their blood! Shed their blood!
- Shed their blood!

369
00:35:57,657 --> 00:36:00,785
Make them hear you in Freetown.
Shed their blood! Shed their blood!

370
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,520
Shed their blood! Shed their blood!
Shed their blood!

371
00:36:03,696 --> 00:36:06,597
- Dia Vandy, stand up.
- Shed their blood! Shed their blood!

372
00:36:06,766 --> 00:36:09,667
- Shed their blood! Shed their blood!
- Put your hand on the gun.

373
00:36:09,836 --> 00:36:11,428
Shed their blood!
Shed their blood!

374
00:36:11,604 --> 00:36:13,196
Shed their blood!
Shed their blood!

375
00:36:13,373 --> 00:36:16,399
- Shed their blood! Shed their blood!
- Now squeeze the trigger.

376
00:36:16,943 --> 00:36:21,346
Come on, Dia. Pull the trigger.
Pull the trigger!

377
00:36:55,481 --> 00:37:00,043
I know, I know.
It's hard to be a man.

378
00:37:00,787 --> 00:37:03,312
Sit up. Come.

379
00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:07,789
But you are a soldier
of the revolution now.

380
00:37:07,994 --> 00:37:10,861
And I am your commander.

381
00:37:11,364 --> 00:37:13,229
Whatever you need...

382
00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:16,630
...guns, CDs, food...

383
00:37:16,803 --> 00:37:20,466
...come to me.
I will take care of you.

384
00:37:23,776 --> 00:37:30,181
Today, you are promoted
to the rank of captain.

385
00:37:34,787 --> 00:37:36,778
Dia Vandy...

386
00:37:38,391 --> 00:37:40,222
...boss man.

387
00:37:57,977 --> 00:37:59,604
How's it, bru?

388
00:38:00,146 --> 00:38:03,309
- You got something for me, huh?
- Yeah.

389
00:38:04,083 --> 00:38:07,484
- So, what's new, M'Ed?
- Fucking RUF.

390
00:38:07,653 --> 00:38:10,178
Tried to hit the government building
across the street.

391
00:38:10,356 --> 00:38:15,020
Shit, man, half the people
be soldiers today, RUF tomorrow.

392
00:38:15,194 --> 00:38:18,595
- Might be time to get your family out, huh?
- And go where?

393
00:38:18,764 --> 00:38:22,495
Just fire up the chopper
and fly away like you people?

394
00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:24,700
This my country, man.

395
00:38:24,871 --> 00:38:28,329
We here long before you came,
long after you gone.

396
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:40,513
- Hi. I'm Maddy Bowen.
- How about you dance with me?

397
00:38:40,686 --> 00:38:44,053
- No, I don't dance.
- Neither do I. Come on.

398
00:38:49,262 --> 00:38:51,662
- So, Danny...
- Archer.

399
00:38:51,964 --> 00:38:53,022
Archer.

400
00:38:54,033 --> 00:38:57,594
When did you first start
moving stones? Was it Angola?

401
00:38:59,372 --> 00:39:03,968
Then you did the whole
mercenary thing. Was that fun?

402
00:39:05,511 --> 00:39:09,174
So, what are you?
Nihilist? Opportunist?

403
00:39:09,382 --> 00:39:11,509
Maybe I wasn't breast-fed
as a child, huh?

404
00:39:13,653 --> 00:39:16,087
You think I haven't met
people like you before?

405
00:39:16,255 --> 00:39:19,622
- I think you get off on people like me.
- You think?

406
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:24,886
When did you first start
working for Van De Kaap?

407
00:39:25,464 --> 00:39:27,091
Christ, you never stop, do you?

408
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:31,734
No, I never stop.

409
00:39:32,438 --> 00:39:34,030
Do you want me to stop?

410
00:39:35,408 --> 00:39:39,310
Why don't we go back to your place,
see what's in the minibar, huh?

411
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:41,571
I'm a print journalist. I drank it.

412
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:45,578
Is it possible that you don't care
how many people die...

413
00:39:45,751 --> 00:39:47,651
...because of the deals you do?

414
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:51,051
People here kill each other as a way of life.
Always been like that.

415
00:39:51,324 --> 00:39:54,157
So you can just watch it
and go about your day?

416
00:39:55,461 --> 00:39:57,554
Maybe we should all just
write about it, then.

417
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:00,062
Look, thanks for the dance, huh?

418
00:40:02,268 --> 00:40:05,635
- And a shot too, huh, M'Ed?
- Sure.

419
00:40:09,475 --> 00:40:10,772
You're a hard case, huh?

420
00:40:10,943 --> 00:40:13,935
Tell me something,
how long you been here in Africa, huh?

421
00:40:14,146 --> 00:40:17,445
Three months. And before that,
Afghanistan and Bosnia.

422
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,843
You come here
with your laptop computer...

423
00:40:20,019 --> 00:40:23,955
...and your malaria medicine
and your little bottles of hand sanitizer.

424
00:40:24,724 --> 00:40:27,750
Think you're gonna change
the outcome, huh?

425
00:40:27,927 --> 00:40:30,521
Let me tell you something.
You sell blood diamonds too.

426
00:40:30,696 --> 00:40:32,186
- Really?
- Yeah.

427
00:40:32,365 --> 00:40:33,354
Tell me, how is that?

428
00:40:33,532 --> 00:40:35,796
Who do you think buys
the stones that I bring out?

429
00:40:35,968 --> 00:40:39,597
Dreamy American girls who all want
a storybook wedding and a big, shiny rock...

430
00:40:39,772 --> 00:40:43,333
...like the ones in the advertisements
of your politically-correct magazines.

431
00:40:43,509 --> 00:40:46,501
So, please, don't come here
and make judgments on me, all right?

432
00:40:47,913 --> 00:40:52,213
I provide a service. The world wants what
we have, and they want it cheap.

433
00:40:52,385 --> 00:40:55,616
We're in business together.
Get over yourself, darling.

434
00:40:56,088 --> 00:41:00,184
Okay, just to clarify, not all American girls
want a storybook wedding...

435
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:03,260
...just like not all Africans kill each other
as a way of life.

436
00:41:03,429 --> 00:41:05,829
And yeah, it's a shit, shit world,
but you know what?

437
00:41:05,998 --> 00:41:09,866
Good things are done every day,
just, apparently, not by you.

438
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:14,496
This place is about to explode.

439
00:41:14,774 --> 00:41:16,799
I wanna spend my time
with someone else.

440
00:41:27,887 --> 00:41:30,913
You are listening to BBC World Service.

441
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:34,821
In Sierra Leone, Revolutionary United Front
forces have been sighted...

442
00:41:34,994 --> 00:41:37,724
...within 10 kilometers
of the capital city of Freetown.

443
00:41:37,897 --> 00:41:40,559
The minister of the interior
has expressed confidence...

444
00:41:40,733 --> 00:41:43,099
...that the government troops
can repel the attack.

445
00:41:43,269 --> 00:41:46,534
All foreign nationals are being advised
to leave the country.

446
00:41:46,706 --> 00:41:48,867
There are also unconfirmed reports...

447
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:53,102
...that atrocities are being committed by
both sides in the rapidly worsening situation.

448
00:41:53,279 --> 00:41:57,215
The United Nations has described
the refugee situation as critical.

449
00:42:08,794 --> 00:42:11,194
Don't tell me you're gonna try
and sell it yourself.

450
00:42:11,364 --> 00:42:13,889
To who?
And for what price, my friend?

451
00:42:14,066 --> 00:42:16,091
You need my help,
whether you like it or not.

452
00:42:16,268 --> 00:42:19,328
- What are you talking about?
- Here, let me help you with that.

453
00:42:19,505 --> 00:42:23,373
You hear that? You hear that?
They came into the city overnight.

454
00:42:23,542 --> 00:42:25,840
It's started.
What are you gonna do now, huh?

455
00:42:26,011 --> 00:42:30,311
Listen, the right stone can buy anything.
Information, safety, even freedom.

456
00:42:30,483 --> 00:42:32,917
But a big stone does not stay secret
for very long.

457
00:42:33,085 --> 00:42:36,350
The moment you tell anyone about it,
your life is absolutely worthless.

458
00:42:36,522 --> 00:42:39,650
The only reason you're alive is
you haven't told anyone where it is.

459
00:42:39,825 --> 00:42:41,087
Am I right? Am I?

460
00:42:41,494 --> 00:42:43,519
Who do you think got you
out of jail, huh?

461
00:42:43,696 --> 00:42:46,756
- That makes us partners.
- I am not your partner!

462
00:42:46,932 --> 00:42:49,423
What if I helped you find your family?

463
00:42:49,602 --> 00:42:51,126
What do you know of my family?

464
00:42:51,303 --> 00:42:54,329
The relief agencies are useless,
the hospitals are overwhelmed.

465
00:42:54,507 --> 00:42:57,101
- There are other ways, bru.
- Liar.

466
00:42:57,276 --> 00:43:00,507
Look at me. I know people, huh?
White people.

467
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:03,807
Without me, you're just another
black man in Africa, all right?

468
00:43:07,186 --> 00:43:08,915
Oh, shit.

469
00:43:10,656 --> 00:43:12,248
We got no time.
What's it gonna be?

470
00:43:12,425 --> 00:43:14,416
You would say anything.
How can I trust you?

471
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:17,994
I don't give a fuck about you, all right?
That diamond could be priceless!

472
00:43:18,164 --> 00:43:22,430
We split it, and you get your family.
What's it gonna be, yes or no? Yes or no?

473
00:43:22,601 --> 00:43:25,195
- Where will we go? Where do we go?
- Come on, follow me!

474
00:43:56,635 --> 00:43:58,262
Stay low!

475
00:44:00,139 --> 00:44:01,367
Get your ass over here!

476
00:44:12,418 --> 00:44:13,476
Wait!

477
00:44:13,919 --> 00:44:15,580
Now!

478
00:44:20,726 --> 00:44:22,284
Come on, come on.

479
00:44:26,332 --> 00:44:27,697
Come on!

480
00:44:43,916 --> 00:44:45,508
Come on.

481
00:44:45,684 --> 00:44:46,878
Fuck!

482
00:44:56,161 --> 00:44:57,992
No, this way.

483
00:44:58,430 --> 00:44:59,920
Fire!

484
00:45:16,148 --> 00:45:17,581
Fuck! Go, go, go!

485
00:45:17,883 --> 00:45:19,475
Go!

486
00:45:29,495 --> 00:45:31,292
Shit!

487
00:45:31,463 --> 00:45:33,124
No! No!

488
00:45:41,607 --> 00:45:43,336
This way.

489
00:46:03,195 --> 00:46:05,356
This way. Stay low.

490
00:46:16,775 --> 00:46:18,538
Come on. Go, go, go. Come on.

491
00:46:25,517 --> 00:46:27,280
Come on!

492
00:46:32,658 --> 00:46:35,183
It's okay. It's okay, it's okay.

493
00:47:00,919 --> 00:47:03,012
Fire!

494
00:48:44,857 --> 00:48:48,623
- Is there another way?
- That bridge is the only way across, huh?

495
00:48:48,794 --> 00:48:50,955
So, what do we do?

496
00:49:01,774 --> 00:49:06,541
- You are RUF, huh? And I am your prisoner.
- What do you mean?

497
00:49:06,712 --> 00:49:09,772
You wanna see your son again, don't you?
You stay behind me.

498
00:49:10,482 --> 00:49:12,109
Wait, wait. Wait.

499
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,816
Bring that pink chicken skin
over here, huh?

500
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:20,390
Now let me shoot that pink ass, boy.

501
00:49:56,094 --> 00:49:58,028
Where are we going?

502
00:49:58,797 --> 00:50:01,357
Lungi's under government control.

503
00:50:01,533 --> 00:50:05,993
I'm gonna try to locate a sat phone
to get in contact with my pilot, all right?

504
00:50:06,171 --> 00:50:08,537
I have agreed to nothing.

505
00:50:09,408 --> 00:50:11,899
You're in a bit of a conundrum there,
my friend.

506
00:50:12,077 --> 00:50:16,343
You know what that means?
It means you have no choice.

507
00:50:30,229 --> 00:50:33,392
So you're a fisherman, huh?

508
00:50:33,565 --> 00:50:37,399
- What do you catch mostly?
- Fish.

509
00:50:45,777 --> 00:50:47,210
Come on.

510
00:50:59,424 --> 00:51:00,948
- Hello.
- Back away from the fence.

511
00:51:01,126 --> 00:51:03,720
Listen, I'm from
the Cape Herald, all right?

512
00:51:03,896 --> 00:51:06,831
My wallet, my credentials,
everything got left in Freetown.

513
00:51:06,999 --> 00:51:09,661
We barely got out with our lives.
Can we just get through?

514
00:51:09,835 --> 00:51:12,861
Back away from the fence.

515
00:51:16,842 --> 00:51:18,503
But you are not a journalist.

516
00:51:18,677 --> 00:51:20,110
I'm trying to get us to Kono.

517
00:51:20,279 --> 00:51:22,679
- Do you understand that, huh?
- Getting B-roll. Wait.

518
00:51:22,848 --> 00:51:25,408
Listen, I'm coming back.
I'm coming back just now.

519
00:51:25,584 --> 00:51:28,644
How's it, my bru?
Have you got an extra smoke?

520
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:30,549
- Here.
- Oh, cheers.

521
00:51:30,722 --> 00:51:33,748
I'm looking for someone, an American
by the name of Maddy Bowen.

522
00:51:33,926 --> 00:51:36,690
- If you saw her, you would not forget it.
- Yeah, I know her.

523
00:51:36,862 --> 00:51:37,851
- Is it?
- Yeah.

524
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:41,625
Can you tell her Danny Archer's looking
for her? I've got the story she wants.

525
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,997
Okay, but I'm going out for a bit.
If I see her before, I'll tell her.

526
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:47,400
Magic. Listen, we'll be
right down the road, huh?

527
00:51:47,572 --> 00:51:50,439
- Sweet. Cheers, bru.
- Cheers.

528
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:55,246
It is as I said.
You will say anything.

529
00:52:01,753 --> 00:52:03,414
- You don't mind waiting?
- No worries.

530
00:52:03,588 --> 00:52:07,456
- Thank you so much. I'll just be a sec.
- All right, Maddy.

531
00:52:10,829 --> 00:52:12,228
Hi.

532
00:52:12,397 --> 00:52:14,160
You got out.

533
00:52:14,333 --> 00:52:17,393
Yes. Hello again.

534
00:52:17,569 --> 00:52:19,901
- This is Solomon Vandy.
- Hi.

535
00:52:20,072 --> 00:52:21,596
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

536
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:25,341
So I'm on deadline. I've been waiting
four hours to use the phone.

537
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:29,810
- I've got someone holding my place in line.
- I understand. Come with me, huh?

538
00:52:30,449 --> 00:52:32,542
All right. Here it is.

539
00:52:32,718 --> 00:52:35,653
- There's a company called Tiara Diamonds.
- Right?

540
00:52:35,821 --> 00:52:38,119
They get the stones
that I smuggle into Liberia.

541
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:40,656
Now, Van De Kaap
has no visible ties to Tiara...

542
00:52:40,826 --> 00:52:44,125
...but through a series of cross holdings
and offshore bank accounts...

543
00:52:44,296 --> 00:52:46,423
- ...they actually own it.
- You can prove this?

544
00:52:47,833 --> 00:52:51,291
- If you help me out, yeah.
- Right, here it comes.

545
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:53,995
Before you say anything,
look at that man. You see him?

546
00:52:54,439 --> 00:52:59,035
His entire village was burned down.
His wife and children, they got away.

547
00:52:59,211 --> 00:53:02,408
He's been working in the mining camps,
trying to get his family back.

548
00:53:02,581 --> 00:53:04,173
He cannot get through the red tape.

549
00:53:04,349 --> 00:53:07,113
All I'm asking is this,
that you help him, huh?

550
00:53:07,285 --> 00:53:09,310
And how do you know this man?

551
00:53:09,955 --> 00:53:13,789
- I know him. I know him.
- Oh, come on, Archer.

552
00:53:14,226 --> 00:53:15,784
You're using him.

553
00:53:17,362 --> 00:53:21,628
I'm using him, and you are using me,
and this is how it works, isn't it?

554
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,564
Come on. Look, you've got access
to U.N. databases.

555
00:53:24,736 --> 00:53:26,636
- You can track his family for him.
- Why?

556
00:53:26,805 --> 00:53:29,968
This whole country's at war.
Why should I help just one person?

557
00:53:35,614 --> 00:53:37,582
I can't believe I just said that.

558
00:53:40,819 --> 00:53:43,447
My family's here, in Guinea?

559
00:53:43,622 --> 00:53:45,920
Yes, according to the manifest.

560
00:53:46,858 --> 00:53:48,621
I do not know how to thank you.

561
00:54:14,619 --> 00:54:17,315
Thank you. Thank you.

562
00:54:31,736 --> 00:54:34,000
This is what a million people looks like.

563
00:54:37,442 --> 00:54:41,276
At the moment, the second largest
refugee camp in Africa.

564
00:54:41,847 --> 00:54:47,547
Might catch a minute of this on CNN,
somewhere between Sports and Weather.

565
00:54:57,028 --> 00:54:58,359
- Hello.
- Yeah, hello?

566
00:54:58,530 --> 00:55:00,896
I've spoken with Colonel Coedoo...

567
00:55:01,333 --> 00:55:04,200
...and highlighted the names
we're looking for.

568
00:55:04,369 --> 00:55:05,563
- Move away.
- What him doing?

569
00:55:05,737 --> 00:55:07,102
Okay, I'm gonna check for you.

570
00:55:07,272 --> 00:55:09,797
- Wait me there.
- Okay, thank you.

571
00:55:10,142 --> 00:55:11,234
We are here to help you.

572
00:55:11,409 --> 00:55:13,673
This woman says she has
spoken to Coedoo.

573
00:55:13,845 --> 00:55:17,611
An entire country made homeless.

574
00:55:20,519 --> 00:55:23,886
Two multiplied by three
is equal to six.

575
00:55:24,055 --> 00:55:27,582
Two multiplied by four
is equal to eight.

576
00:55:27,759 --> 00:55:30,990
Two multiplied by five
is equal to 10.

577
00:55:31,163 --> 00:55:34,257
Two multiplied by six
is equal to 12.

578
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:13,498
Jassie.

579
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:16,129
Jassie!

580
00:56:16,875 --> 00:56:18,604
Jassie!

581
00:56:18,777 --> 00:56:19,937
- Jassie.
- Solo.

582
00:56:20,111 --> 00:56:21,339
- Jassie.
- Solo.

583
00:56:21,546 --> 00:56:23,878
Jassie. Jassie.

584
00:56:25,984 --> 00:56:27,747
- Solomon.
- Jassie.

585
00:56:36,528 --> 00:56:37,756
- Solomon.
- Jassie.

586
00:56:39,497 --> 00:56:41,294
Dia. Dia.

587
00:56:42,267 --> 00:56:43,529
Where is Dia?

588
00:56:47,339 --> 00:56:48,465
Jassie!

589
00:56:59,184 --> 00:57:01,414
They took him.

590
00:57:05,824 --> 00:57:07,815
There are only two children
on the manifest.

591
00:57:07,993 --> 00:57:10,518
- Where is my son?
- Oh, Christ.

592
00:57:10,795 --> 00:57:12,660
Where is my son?

593
00:57:12,831 --> 00:57:14,594
- Away from the fence.
- Where is my son?

594
00:57:14,766 --> 00:57:16,028
Move away from the fence.

595
00:57:16,201 --> 00:57:19,261
- Let them out! Let them out!
- Keep away from the fence.

596
00:57:20,672 --> 00:57:21,866
Let them out!

597
00:57:25,377 --> 00:57:26,366
Away from the fence.

598
00:57:28,346 --> 00:57:30,143
- They'll shoot you!
- Jassie!

599
00:57:30,315 --> 00:57:32,681
No! Solo!

600
00:57:32,851 --> 00:57:35,149
Do you want your wife and child
to watch you die?

601
00:57:35,854 --> 00:57:38,652
Solo! Solo!

602
00:57:48,099 --> 00:57:52,661
They said they're concerned that
some of the refugees might be rebels...

603
00:57:53,204 --> 00:57:56,935
...so they refused to release them
until there's a cease-fire.

604
00:57:58,343 --> 00:58:01,107
I'm so sorry, Solomon.

605
00:58:01,479 --> 00:58:04,141
What you want, Mr. Archer,
is beyond those hills...

606
00:58:04,316 --> 00:58:06,477
...where I buried it.

607
00:58:29,741 --> 00:58:34,644
You say the mine is on the Sewa River.
Where exactly?

608
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:37,304
Solomon.

609
00:58:38,316 --> 00:58:40,181
I do not need a map.

610
00:58:40,352 --> 00:58:44,755
Yeah, well, I do.
Look, we are down here, huh?

611
00:58:44,923 --> 00:58:46,686
The press convoy
is on its way to Kono.

612
00:58:46,858 --> 00:58:50,157
You say the diamond mine is up here.
Where did you bury it?

613
00:58:53,498 --> 00:58:56,695
When we get to Kono,
we're gonna have to walk, all right?

614
00:58:56,868 --> 00:58:59,632
You damn well better be able to find it.

615
00:59:01,573 --> 00:59:05,805
My son is a very good student.

616
00:59:06,978 --> 00:59:09,606
He walks five kilometers
to the Sister School...

617
00:59:09,781 --> 00:59:13,148
...every morning to study English.

618
00:59:14,986 --> 00:59:18,046
He's going to be a doctor one day.

619
00:59:42,347 --> 00:59:46,249
"In the 90-degree heat,
Solomon Vandy drops to his knees...

620
00:59:46,418 --> 00:59:50,081
...rattling the wire
with his powerful hands."

621
00:59:53,625 --> 00:59:56,389
- What?
- Nothing.

622
00:59:58,496 --> 01:00:00,521
Do you think I'm exploiting his grief?

623
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:04,263
You're right. It's shit.

624
01:00:05,036 --> 01:00:07,766
It's like one of those infomercials.

625
01:00:07,939 --> 01:00:12,774
You know, the little black babies
with swollen bellies and flies in their eyes.

626
01:00:12,944 --> 01:00:16,846
So here I've got dead mothers,
I've got severed limbs, but it's nothing new.

627
01:00:17,015 --> 01:00:19,609
It might be enough
to make people cry if they read it...

628
01:00:19,784 --> 01:00:21,251
...maybe even write a check...

629
01:00:21,419 --> 01:00:23,785
...but it's not gonna be enough
to make it stop.

630
01:00:24,088 --> 01:00:28,650
I am sick of writing about victims,
but it's all I can fucking do.

631
01:00:28,827 --> 01:00:30,351
Because I need facts.

632
01:00:30,528 --> 01:00:35,056
I need names. I need dates.
I need pictures. I need bank accounts.

633
01:00:37,101 --> 01:00:39,626
People back home
wouldn't buy a ring...

634
01:00:39,804 --> 01:00:42,068
...if they knew it cost
someone else their hand.

635
01:00:42,707 --> 01:00:44,868
But I can't write that story...

636
01:00:45,043 --> 01:00:48,570
...until I get facts
that can be verified...

637
01:00:48,746 --> 01:00:53,877
...which is to say, until I find someone
who will go on record.

638
01:00:55,053 --> 01:00:56,577
So if that is not you...

639
01:00:56,754 --> 01:01:00,850
...and you're not really gonna help me,
and we're not really gonna screw...

640
01:01:01,025 --> 01:01:04,256
...then why don't you get the fuck
out of my face...

641
01:01:04,429 --> 01:01:06,329
...and let me do my work?

642
01:01:14,472 --> 01:01:18,408
Do you know that Solomon thinks
his son's gonna be a doctor one day?

643
01:01:21,179 --> 01:01:24,342
Maybe his baby dies in that camp.
Maybe his daughter gets raped.

644
01:01:24,682 --> 01:01:26,843
Who knows, maybe both.

645
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,683
Do you realize that
that diamond...

646
01:01:30,855 --> 01:01:33,619
...is the only chance he has
of getting his family out?

647
01:01:33,791 --> 01:01:38,023
- You don't give a rat's ass about his family.
- Do you understand that?

648
01:01:43,501 --> 01:01:45,560
Listen, I need to get to Kono, all right?

649
01:01:45,737 --> 01:01:47,830
The only way
is with the press convoy.

650
01:01:48,006 --> 01:01:50,372
I'm a journalist,
and he's my cameraman, all right?

651
01:01:50,542 --> 01:01:52,066
- No.
- Please, Maddy.

652
01:01:52,243 --> 01:01:53,870
- Please.
- No!

653
01:02:07,191 --> 01:02:09,557
After I smuggle the stones
across the border...

654
01:02:10,728 --> 01:02:13,458
...local buyers get them
to a middleman in Monrovia.

655
01:02:17,302 --> 01:02:18,599
Go on.

656
01:02:20,104 --> 01:02:24,973
He pays off Customs and then certifies
that the diamonds were mined in Liberia.

657
01:02:25,143 --> 01:02:27,509
That way, they can be legally exported.

658
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:31,173
Now, once they've reached
the buyers in Antwerp...

659
01:02:31,349 --> 01:02:33,840
...diamonds are brought
to the sorting tables...

660
01:02:34,018 --> 01:02:35,610
...no more questions are asked.

661
01:02:36,788 --> 01:02:38,551
By the time they get to India...

662
01:02:38,723 --> 01:02:42,454
...the dirty stones are mixed with
the clean stones from all over the world...

663
01:02:42,627 --> 01:02:44,891
...and then they become
like any other diamonds.

664
01:02:45,063 --> 01:02:47,258
And Van De Kaap
knows about all this?

665
01:02:48,866 --> 01:02:49,924
Yeah.

666
01:02:50,101 --> 01:02:52,763
When I get to London,
I meet with Simmons.

667
01:02:53,204 --> 01:02:56,640
Supply and demand. You control the supply,
and you keep the demand high.

668
01:02:56,808 --> 01:02:58,275
- Agreed.
- Good.

669
01:02:58,443 --> 01:03:00,809
Now, there's an underground vault...

670
01:03:00,979 --> 01:03:04,540
...where they put all the stones
they buy up to keep off the market...

671
01:03:04,716 --> 01:03:06,547
...so they can keep the price high.

672
01:03:07,318 --> 01:03:10,719
If rebels wanna flood the market
with a billion dollars' worth of rough...

673
01:03:10,888 --> 01:03:13,948
...a company like Van De Kaap,
who says that they're rare...

674
01:03:14,125 --> 01:03:15,786
...can't afford to let that happen.

675
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:18,224
Especially when they're telling
some poor sod...

676
01:03:18,396 --> 01:03:20,887
...he's supposed to shell out
three months' salary...

677
01:03:21,065 --> 01:03:22,396
...for an engagement ring.

678
01:03:22,567 --> 01:03:25,559
Now, technically speaking,
they're not financing the war...

679
01:03:25,737 --> 01:03:28,570
...but creating a situation
where it pays to keep it going.

680
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:31,971
- You understand?
- Yes. And where's my proof?

681
01:03:38,449 --> 01:03:42,579
Names, dates and numbered accounts.

682
01:03:44,689 --> 01:03:47,749
You publish one word of this story
before I give them the stone...

683
01:03:47,925 --> 01:03:49,950
...and I'm dead, huh?

684
01:03:50,128 --> 01:03:54,497
After I give it to them,
then... I leave this continent forever.

685
01:03:56,734 --> 01:03:58,531
If you don't come out
with the diamond?

686
01:03:58,703 --> 01:04:01,103
Then write whatever you want.

687
01:04:01,939 --> 01:04:04,032
I'm already dead.

688
01:04:10,882 --> 01:04:14,545
Now, remember. All you say is,
"I am the cameraman," all right?

689
01:04:14,719 --> 01:04:16,653
Listen, I cannot do this.

690
01:04:16,821 --> 01:04:19,449
- Why not?
- Because I am not a journalist.

691
01:04:19,624 --> 01:04:22,115
- Of course you're not.
- Well, then how can I say I am?

692
01:04:22,293 --> 01:04:25,490
Because you do. Because that's how
you get your son back, all right?

693
01:04:25,663 --> 01:04:28,063
Now get on the bus. Go.

694
01:04:44,749 --> 01:04:47,650
I am the cameraman.

695
01:04:53,591 --> 01:04:55,752
You are writing about
what is happening here?

696
01:04:56,561 --> 01:04:57,550
Yes.

697
01:04:57,729 --> 01:05:01,927
So when people in your country read it,
they will come help us, yes?

698
01:05:02,667 --> 01:05:03,725
Probably not.

699
01:05:05,336 --> 01:05:07,702
- You heard of a Stinger?
- What?

700
01:05:07,872 --> 01:05:12,332
Your friend, Maddy. She's like a full-on,
heat-seeking missile, bru.

701
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:15,206
I mean, I saw her go into Afghanistan...

702
01:05:15,379 --> 01:05:18,507
...like about 200 clicks
into Taliban land.

703
01:05:18,683 --> 01:05:21,516
When the military said no,
she just took a bus, bru.

704
01:05:21,686 --> 01:05:24,985
Came back with 3000 words,
and she still looked so good.

705
01:05:25,156 --> 01:05:27,021
- Like hot, you know?
- All right.

706
01:05:27,191 --> 01:05:28,920
Calm down to the frantic now, huh?

707
01:05:30,528 --> 01:05:32,359
- What's that?
- What's going on?

708
01:05:33,498 --> 01:05:34,726
Looks like it was an RPG.

709
01:05:34,899 --> 01:05:36,730
Open the door. Let us out.

710
01:05:37,068 --> 01:05:39,002
- Let's go, let's go.
- Come on. Go, go, go.

711
01:05:40,972 --> 01:05:42,439
Go, go! Move, move, move!

712
01:05:43,241 --> 01:05:46,142
We've just happened upon
the sight of an ambush...

713
01:05:47,278 --> 01:05:49,610
...fifteen kilometers
from the Liberian border...

714
01:05:49,781 --> 01:05:52,409
- ...near the Moa River...
- As you can see behind me...

715
01:05:52,583 --> 01:05:54,107
...just a few minutes ago...

716
01:05:54,285 --> 01:05:56,617
- ...an ambulance has...
- Got movement in the bush.

717
01:05:56,821 --> 01:05:58,846
- Check out the head of the road.
- Spread out.

718
01:05:59,023 --> 01:06:00,752
--at this site.
Dozens of--

719
01:06:01,759 --> 01:06:03,693
Many are injured.

720
01:06:13,838 --> 01:06:17,001
Get back on the bus, huh?
Get back on! Come on!

721
01:06:17,175 --> 01:06:18,802
- Maddy!
- Move it! Move it!

722
01:06:18,976 --> 01:06:19,965
Get back on the bus!

723
01:06:20,144 --> 01:06:21,702
Solomon! Solomon!

724
01:06:21,879 --> 01:06:23,369
- Let's go.
- Solomon, come here!

725
01:06:23,548 --> 01:06:24,981
- Go, go, go.
- Come on, come on.

726
01:06:25,183 --> 01:06:27,845
- Get in the bus!
- Move, move, move! Come on, come on.

727
01:06:28,186 --> 01:06:30,017
- Move!
- Get in the bus. Let's go.

728
01:06:30,188 --> 01:06:32,383
Get in, get in.
Goddamn it, get in! Get in!

729
01:06:32,557 --> 01:06:34,991
- Let me inside!
- There's no fucking space!

730
01:06:35,159 --> 01:06:37,423
- Let them on the bus.
- You give him your seat.

731
01:06:37,595 --> 01:06:40,564
What if we just take your place, huh?
What if we take your place?

732
01:06:40,731 --> 01:06:43,666
That's enough. He can ride with me.
Oi, he can ride with me.

733
01:06:43,835 --> 01:06:46,395
Maddy! Let's go!
Maddy, let's go. Come on!

734
01:06:59,317 --> 01:07:02,445
Nothing like a little bang-bang
to get the heart started, Maddy.

735
01:07:03,321 --> 01:07:06,518
- Whatever you say, Corbauld.
- Come on, love. Don't be like that.

736
01:07:06,691 --> 01:07:10,149
Story's played out, hasn't it?
Government bad, rebels worse.

737
01:07:10,695 --> 01:07:13,129
No one gives a toss anymore.
Know what I mean?

738
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:50,834
This medicine will make you strong...

739
01:07:51,369 --> 01:07:53,769
...make you invisible to your enemies.

740
01:07:53,938 --> 01:07:56,168
Bullets will bounce off you.

741
01:08:06,984 --> 01:08:10,750
Superboy Killer, yes, huh?
Commando.

742
01:08:11,923 --> 01:08:13,857
Foreigners are the cause of the problems.

743
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:20,294
Poppy Sankoh say,
"Overthrow those who would exploit you."

744
01:08:22,166 --> 01:08:23,656
I am Baby Killer.

745
01:08:27,438 --> 01:08:31,101
- I am the Master of Disaster.
- You will be strong.

746
01:08:34,445 --> 01:08:35,878
I am Born Trouble.

747
01:08:42,286 --> 01:08:44,345
I am See Me No More.

748
01:08:53,898 --> 01:08:56,833
You'd think they'd want
at least one decent road in this place.

749
01:08:58,269 --> 01:09:02,399
I'm gonna have to start charging
an entrance fee. Oh, God!

750
01:09:33,219 --> 01:09:34,447
Get down!

751
01:09:42,562 --> 01:09:44,792
- Look out!
- Shit!

752
01:09:57,310 --> 01:09:58,868
- You all right?
- Fine.

753
01:10:04,517 --> 01:10:05,814
Shit!

754
01:10:08,922 --> 01:10:10,253
Hold on!

755
01:10:20,367 --> 01:10:21,766
Hold on!

756
01:10:33,046 --> 01:10:34,274
Come on.

757
01:10:41,788 --> 01:10:43,983
- Everyone all right, huh?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

758
01:10:44,190 --> 01:10:45,623
Let me see that. You okay?

759
01:10:45,792 --> 01:10:46,850
- Yeah.
- All right.

760
01:10:49,496 --> 01:10:52,488
Quietly, now. Quietly.

761
01:11:13,653 --> 01:11:15,086
Come on.

762
01:11:36,381 --> 01:11:40,545
Kamajors. Local militia
protecting their homes, huh?

763
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:42,584
- Do not look them in the eye.
- No.

764
01:11:57,069 --> 01:11:58,559
Excuse me. Excuse me?

765
01:11:59,504 --> 01:12:02,871
Hi, I'm Maddy Bowen
with Vital Affairs magazine.

766
01:12:03,041 --> 01:12:06,101
Wonder if I could take your picture.
I'm just gonna get my camera.

767
01:12:06,278 --> 01:12:09,213
I've heard about your struggle.
I'd love to know more about it.

768
01:12:09,381 --> 01:12:12,009
Would you mind if I took your picture?
Everyone together?

769
01:12:12,351 --> 01:12:14,114
Everyone could all come in together.

770
01:12:17,623 --> 01:12:19,648
Is that okay?
If everyone could come closer.

771
01:12:20,692 --> 01:12:23,786
If you come over here and come in
nice and close. That's good.

772
01:12:23,962 --> 01:12:27,420
Yeah. That's great.
And we'll get one with all of us.

773
01:12:27,699 --> 01:12:29,496
There you go. That's perfect.

774
01:12:31,303 --> 01:12:33,828
How about one together?
Us together, what do you think?

775
01:12:34,006 --> 01:12:35,974
I'll come in like this, yeah?

776
01:12:36,775 --> 01:12:37,764
Cheese.

777
01:12:39,945 --> 01:12:42,277
So do you think
they've read your work?

778
01:12:42,447 --> 01:12:44,574
Shut up.

779
01:12:57,462 --> 01:12:59,794
Hey, get them, get them, get them.

780
01:13:01,433 --> 01:13:05,130
- I got a score. I got a score.
- You missed.

781
01:13:05,837 --> 01:13:07,998
Where have you come from?

782
01:13:08,573 --> 01:13:11,303
- Where did you come from?
- Where have you come from?

783
01:13:12,411 --> 01:13:15,244
That's right. Yeah.
From New York. From America.

784
01:13:15,414 --> 01:13:17,314
I don't have anything for you.

785
01:13:37,636 --> 01:13:39,433
My name is Benjamin Margai.

786
01:13:40,138 --> 01:13:42,197
Danny Archer. This is Maddy Bowen.

787
01:13:42,374 --> 01:13:45,434
- Hello. How are you?
- Very well, thank you.

788
01:14:00,258 --> 01:14:02,556
I'm the cameraman?

789
01:14:05,163 --> 01:14:08,098
The Belgians were the first
to chop off limbs in Africa.

790
01:14:08,266 --> 01:14:12,635
King Leopold took one hand
for every hundredth slave in the Congo...

791
01:14:12,804 --> 01:14:14,897
...to keep them in line.

792
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:18,475
Many of these children
were taken by the RUF.

793
01:14:18,643 --> 01:14:20,634
We have taken them back.

794
01:14:20,812 --> 01:14:23,906
Some of them have been
made to do horrible things.

795
01:14:24,082 --> 01:14:27,108
We are trying
to bring them back to life.

796
01:14:27,285 --> 01:14:28,912
Let me show you.

797
01:14:30,956 --> 01:14:33,254
Imagine doing all this, huh?

798
01:14:34,559 --> 01:14:36,459
What's your excuse?

799
01:14:37,262 --> 01:14:42,598
Well, it's gotten hard to go back
to sipping lattes and talking interest rates.

800
01:14:42,834 --> 01:14:45,462
So you're an action junkie, huh?

801
01:14:46,405 --> 01:14:48,703
Three out of five ex-boyfriends
recently polled...

802
01:14:48,874 --> 01:14:53,311
...say that I prefer to be
in a constant state of crisis.

803
01:14:53,845 --> 01:14:56,109
Maybe I just give a shit.

804
01:14:59,785 --> 01:15:00,774
You were good today.

805
01:15:03,221 --> 01:15:04,552
You know that?

806
01:15:05,690 --> 01:15:07,180
You too.

807
01:15:10,128 --> 01:15:13,063
"--that sometimes they forgot
to close the door.

808
01:15:13,231 --> 01:15:16,291
She also wrote
about her sister Josie...

809
01:15:16,902 --> 01:15:21,896
...who was very ill
and who had to be taken to hospital."

810
01:15:23,942 --> 01:15:25,136
Cheers.

811
01:15:27,946 --> 01:15:30,540
So how many attacks
have there been in the area?

812
01:15:30,715 --> 01:15:33,616
I have known most of the rebels
since they were children.

813
01:15:33,785 --> 01:15:38,313
The local commander is still afraid
I will come after him with my ruler.

814
01:15:39,758 --> 01:15:43,216
So you think because your intentions
are good, they'll spare you, huh?

815
01:15:43,395 --> 01:15:46,228
My heart always told me
that people are inherently good.

816
01:15:46,398 --> 01:15:48,593
My experience suggests otherwise.

817
01:15:48,767 --> 01:15:50,564
But what about you, Mr. Archer?

818
01:15:51,002 --> 01:15:53,436
In your long career as a journalist...

819
01:15:53,605 --> 01:15:56,438
...would you say that people
are mostly good?

820
01:15:58,510 --> 01:15:59,943
No.

821
01:16:00,212 --> 01:16:01,736
I'd say they're just people.

822
01:16:01,913 --> 01:16:05,849
Exactly. It is what they do
that makes them good or bad.

823
01:16:06,017 --> 01:16:09,248
A moment of love,
even in a bad man...

824
01:16:09,521 --> 01:16:11,989
...can give meaning to a life.

825
01:16:12,157 --> 01:16:15,786
None of us knows which path
will lead us to God.

826
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:20,020
Hey!

827
01:17:08,013 --> 01:17:09,878
It's palm wine.

828
01:17:19,157 --> 01:17:22,092
- Jesus Christ.
- Yeah, yeah. It takes getting used to, huh?

829
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:23,750
God.

830
01:17:23,929 --> 01:17:26,659
- Drank that as a boy.
- In Rhodesia?

831
01:17:28,833 --> 01:17:30,061
I take notes.

832
01:17:32,771 --> 01:17:34,500
The Shona...

833
01:17:35,807 --> 01:17:38,105
The Shona have a word for me.

834
01:17:39,945 --> 01:17:43,574
- It means "white boy in Africa."
- When did you leave?

835
01:17:44,215 --> 01:17:45,910
I didn't leave.

836
01:17:46,084 --> 01:17:50,418
I got sent away to South Africa
in 1978 when the munts overran us.

837
01:17:50,755 --> 01:17:52,222
Then you joined the army?

838
01:17:55,093 --> 01:17:57,254
Yeah. Yeah, I did my time in Angola.

839
01:17:57,429 --> 01:18:00,125
- The 32 Battalion.
- That's right.

840
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:05,765
You know, contrary to what
you might think about us...

841
01:18:05,937 --> 01:18:09,429
...we fought with the blacks, huh?
Yeah. Side by side.

842
01:18:09,608 --> 01:18:13,339
There was no apartheid in a foxhole.
The colonel always used to tell us that.

843
01:18:13,511 --> 01:18:16,912
- This is Colonel Coetzee?
- Yeah.

844
01:18:19,150 --> 01:18:22,551
Then, of course, it's 1994.
No more army.

845
01:18:22,721 --> 01:18:24,552
No more apartheid.

846
01:18:24,723 --> 01:18:28,090
Truth and reconciliation
and all of that rubbish, you know.

847
01:18:28,259 --> 01:18:29,749
Kumbaya.

848
01:18:30,528 --> 01:18:33,292
We fought and died together,
you know?

849
01:18:33,465 --> 01:18:36,730
Black and white. Most people back home
didn't even know we were at war.

850
01:18:36,901 --> 01:18:38,766
We thought we were
fighting Communism...

851
01:18:38,937 --> 01:18:42,805
...but in the end, it was all about
who gets what, you know?

852
01:18:42,974 --> 01:18:46,034
Ivory, oil, gold:

853
01:18:46,978 --> 01:18:48,741
Diamonds.

854
01:18:51,983 --> 01:18:54,952
So one day I decided,
"Fuck it," you know?

855
01:18:55,587 --> 01:18:57,145
"I'm gonna get mine."

856
01:18:57,322 --> 01:18:58,914
You gonna steal his diamond?

857
01:19:06,431 --> 01:19:10,128
That diamond is my ticket
out of this godforsaken continent.

858
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:12,166
That doesn't answer the question.

859
01:19:22,814 --> 01:19:26,910
My dad came home
from the war in '69.

860
01:19:29,187 --> 01:19:31,052
And it took him...

861
01:19:32,190 --> 01:19:34,283
...about 20 years to get right.

862
01:19:36,161 --> 01:19:37,458
What?

863
01:19:40,331 --> 01:19:44,631
You Americans love to talk
about your feelings, huh?

864
01:19:44,803 --> 01:19:47,067
So, what does that mean?
What does that mean?

865
01:19:47,238 --> 01:19:49,365
- Got a thing for messed-up vets now?
- Shut up.

866
01:19:51,376 --> 01:19:52,843
You lost both your parents.

867
01:19:53,745 --> 01:19:56,578
That's a polite way
of putting it, yeah.

868
01:19:59,217 --> 01:20:01,549
Mom was raped and shot...

869
01:20:04,389 --> 01:20:07,483
...and Dad was decapitated
and hung from a hook in the barn.

870
01:20:09,027 --> 01:20:10,756
I was 9.

871
01:20:14,365 --> 01:20:15,957
Boohoo, right?

872
01:20:19,704 --> 01:20:21,831
Sometimes I wonder...

873
01:20:24,943 --> 01:20:28,003
...will God ever forgive us
for what we've done to each other?

874
01:20:31,649 --> 01:20:34,516
Then I look around and I realize...

875
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:38,878
...God left this place a long time ago.

876
01:20:45,597 --> 01:20:47,622
It's...

877
01:20:49,901 --> 01:20:51,835
What's the point, huh?

878
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:37,305
Oh, shit. Keep moving, huh?

879
01:21:37,482 --> 01:21:39,245
- What?
- Drive at them. They'll panic.

880
01:21:39,417 --> 01:21:41,681
Do you know where the word
"infantry" comes from?

881
01:21:41,853 --> 01:21:45,152
It means "child soldier."
They are just children.

882
01:21:45,323 --> 01:21:48,986
- Stop! Stop! RUF on the road!
- Hi. Hello. Hello.

883
01:21:50,228 --> 01:21:51,286
Hello, little brothers.

884
01:21:51,462 --> 01:21:53,987
- RUF on the road!
- Yeah, yeah. What is your names?

885
01:21:54,499 --> 01:21:56,797
I'm Dead Body.
Who is this motherfucker?

886
01:21:56,968 --> 01:21:58,629
We are teachers on our way to Kono.

887
01:21:58,803 --> 01:22:01,033
Only RUF on the road.

888
01:22:01,206 --> 01:22:03,140
- RUF only!
- Yes, yes, I understand that.

889
01:22:03,341 --> 01:22:04,672
- Only RUF!
- But son, this is--

890
01:22:06,945 --> 01:22:08,537
Don't move! Don't move! Fuck.

891
01:22:10,782 --> 01:22:14,115
Jesus Christ! Maddy, press your hand
against the exit wound there, huh?

892
01:22:14,285 --> 01:22:16,583
- Got it.
- Keep it there, huh?

893
01:22:16,754 --> 01:22:18,517
Whatever you do,
don't talk, all right?

894
01:22:18,690 --> 01:22:20,521
Is there any wine left in that jug?

895
01:22:20,692 --> 01:22:22,557
- Here.
- Pour it all over everything, huh?

896
01:22:24,095 --> 01:22:27,030
The colonel's gonna have a medic
at the airstrip in Kono.

897
01:22:27,198 --> 01:22:30,190
- How far is it?
- You said not to talk.

898
01:22:30,468 --> 01:22:31,662
A comedian, huh?

899
01:22:45,850 --> 01:22:48,250
- How's his pulse?
- I can feel it sometimes.

900
01:22:58,696 --> 01:23:01,665
- Hold it right there.
- Stop.

901
01:23:01,833 --> 01:23:03,061
Papers, please.

902
01:23:07,238 --> 01:23:08,466
Excuse me.

903
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:11,575
I was just trying
to keep pressure on the wound.

904
01:23:11,743 --> 01:23:14,268
- He's lost a lot of blood.
- You'll be all right, huh?

905
01:23:14,946 --> 01:23:16,243
Will you?

906
01:23:16,948 --> 01:23:19,940
I'll check on him in the tent
in a little bit. Thank you.

907
01:23:20,184 --> 01:23:21,515
Hey.

908
01:23:22,053 --> 01:23:24,044
Look who's alive, eh?

909
01:23:24,222 --> 01:23:25,553
I told the H you'd be back.

910
01:23:27,525 --> 01:23:30,460
I'm afraid we're evacuating
all non-military personnel, miss.

911
01:23:30,628 --> 01:23:32,459
Transport touches down at 1600.

912
01:23:32,630 --> 01:23:34,393
She's with me, all right?

913
01:23:34,599 --> 01:23:38,262
No exceptions, pal. This is gonna be ugly.
Colonel doesn't want an audience.

914
01:23:38,436 --> 01:23:41,234
Is I.R.'s presence here
known to other African nations?

915
01:23:42,740 --> 01:23:44,765
- She's with you?
- Yeah.

916
01:23:45,910 --> 01:23:47,775
Come on. The colonel's this way.

917
01:23:47,946 --> 01:23:49,777
Give me a minute, huh?

918
01:23:52,951 --> 01:23:55,476
We block their escape
by blowing the bridge.

919
01:23:57,121 --> 01:23:58,816
That's correct.

920
01:23:59,557 --> 01:24:01,855
You made it out. Well done.

921
01:24:02,060 --> 01:24:03,994
Negative, Kilo Foxtrot, stand by.

922
01:24:04,662 --> 01:24:08,325
- Colonel, sir.
- So must be real, then.

923
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:10,694
The pink.

924
01:24:11,202 --> 01:24:13,796
Well, you're part
of this operation now.

925
01:24:13,972 --> 01:24:17,464
First we snuff everything that moves
out there, then we find your diamond.

926
01:24:17,642 --> 01:24:19,269
Colonel?

927
01:24:19,811 --> 01:24:22,245
Go get kitted. Yes?

928
01:24:28,553 --> 01:24:30,544
Move, move, move!

929
01:24:30,755 --> 01:24:34,020
- Go get your kit.
- Will do, chum. Will do.

930
01:24:37,562 --> 01:24:40,725
It's go time, all right?
Meet me behind the tents.

931
01:24:43,835 --> 01:24:45,530
How's Benjamin?

932
01:24:45,703 --> 01:24:47,170
They say he'll live.

933
01:24:48,506 --> 01:24:49,768
Good. Good.

934
01:24:57,181 --> 01:24:58,978
Listen, Maddy...

935
01:25:00,385 --> 01:25:02,148
...I need you to do me one last favor.

936
01:25:03,187 --> 01:25:04,552
Yeah?

937
01:25:06,524 --> 01:25:08,185
Tell that guard
you wanna put him...

938
01:25:08,359 --> 01:25:11,021
...on the cover of Soldier of Fortune
magazine for me.

939
01:25:17,068 --> 01:25:18,296
You're going in.

940
01:25:22,707 --> 01:25:24,971
You and Solomon.

941
01:25:27,145 --> 01:25:28,134
You're going in now.

942
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:31,175
Your plane leaves
in a few minutes, huh?

943
01:25:33,785 --> 01:25:35,753
You're an idiot.

944
01:25:40,058 --> 01:25:42,925
- What if I wanted to go in with you?
- I'd say no.

945
01:25:43,094 --> 01:25:45,085
- What if I insist?
- I'd insist back.

946
01:25:51,202 --> 01:25:52,396
It's my story.

947
01:25:52,570 --> 01:25:55,971
Your story is Van De Kaap, all right?
That stone is mine.

948
01:25:56,140 --> 01:25:59,576
I'm not leaving here without it,
you understand?

949
01:26:01,045 --> 01:26:03,912
Please, just give me two minutes.

950
01:26:20,665 --> 01:26:22,064
Yeah.

951
01:26:33,377 --> 01:26:35,072
- Hello.
- Hi.

952
01:26:35,246 --> 01:26:38,477
My name is Maddy Bowen.
I'm with Vital Affairs magazine.

953
01:26:38,649 --> 01:26:41,117
I was wondering
if I could ask you a few questions.

954
01:26:41,285 --> 01:26:42,809
Well, that depends what they are.

955
01:26:42,987 --> 01:26:46,946
Oh, I see you're familiar
with our devious ways, aren't you?

956
01:26:47,692 --> 01:26:49,592
Okay, so I'll start
with something simple.

957
01:27:02,206 --> 01:27:04,868
And before that you were with
the South African Defense--?

958
01:27:05,042 --> 01:27:06,703
- Defense Force, correct.
- Of course.

959
01:27:06,878 --> 01:27:10,314
And was that with Colonel Coetzee?
Were you in Angola?

960
01:27:10,481 --> 01:27:12,005
Angola, yeah.

961
01:27:13,618 --> 01:27:16,587
That is all I really need to know.
Thank you so much.

962
01:27:16,787 --> 01:27:18,254
- Thank you.
- Okay.

963
01:27:28,266 --> 01:27:29,665
Thank you, huh?

964
01:27:29,834 --> 01:27:32,268
Just keeping my end of the deal.

965
01:27:32,870 --> 01:27:34,167
Good luck to you, Solomon.

966
01:27:34,472 --> 01:27:35,962
Okay.

967
01:27:37,141 --> 01:27:40,975
- I hope you find what you're looking for.
- Thank you for all you have done.

968
01:27:48,419 --> 01:27:51,013
- Listen, I--
- No, you listen.

969
01:27:55,626 --> 01:27:57,526
In another life maybe, all right?

970
01:27:58,963 --> 01:28:00,794
Yeah. Sure.

971
01:28:00,965 --> 01:28:02,330
Yeah.

972
01:28:06,671 --> 01:28:08,798
You find yourself a good man,
all right, Maddy?

973
01:28:14,745 --> 01:28:17,771
You know, I've got three sisters.

974
01:28:17,949 --> 01:28:20,577
They're all married to good men.

975
01:28:22,453 --> 01:28:23,511
I prefer my life.

976
01:28:26,157 --> 01:28:30,617
Here is my office phone...

977
01:28:30,795 --> 01:28:33,161
...home phone, cellphone.

978
01:28:35,266 --> 01:28:38,429
I'm used to being pursued,
but what the heck.

979
01:28:49,614 --> 01:28:51,741
You better get on that plane, huh?

980
01:28:53,484 --> 01:28:55,384
You should get on that plane.

981
01:29:03,561 --> 01:29:05,358
So should you.

982
01:29:11,836 --> 01:29:12,962
You gonna call me?

983
01:29:16,774 --> 01:29:18,264
Soon as I'm near a phone, yeah.

984
01:29:19,210 --> 01:29:21,576
Yeah, right.

985
01:29:43,401 --> 01:29:46,666
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

986
01:29:51,242 --> 01:29:52,834
Oh, shit.

987
01:29:53,110 --> 01:29:55,840
Nabil? Yeah, I'll call you
when we get closer, all right?

988
01:29:56,013 --> 01:29:58,607
You keep me posted. Right.

989
01:29:58,783 --> 01:30:02,583
All right. I set the pace, huh?
Two-hour marches, five-minute breaks.

990
01:30:02,753 --> 01:30:06,587
If I hold my hand up like this, you stop.
If I point to the dirt, you lie flat.

991
01:30:06,757 --> 01:30:10,318
If I say go, you move like your life
depended on it. Understood?

992
01:30:10,494 --> 01:30:13,156
- Yes, boss.
- Come on.

993
01:30:23,441 --> 01:30:25,102
Tell me about the stone.

994
01:30:25,276 --> 01:30:27,904
Is it clear or is it milky?

995
01:30:28,079 --> 01:30:29,603
Clear.

996
01:30:29,780 --> 01:30:32,180
And the color, is it strong?

997
01:30:32,350 --> 01:30:33,578
Does it hold the light?

998
01:30:33,751 --> 01:30:35,810
It is as you say.

999
01:30:36,253 --> 01:30:39,416
- About the size of a bird's egg?
- Yes.

1000
01:30:39,590 --> 01:30:43,754
One hundred carats.
Come on, let's pick up the pace.

1001
01:31:25,336 --> 01:31:26,701
Dia!

1002
01:31:28,606 --> 01:31:30,574
Stop the truck!

1003
01:31:31,342 --> 01:31:33,037
I thought it was Dia.

1004
01:32:26,964 --> 01:32:28,522
Wake up.

1005
01:32:30,367 --> 01:32:33,461
Don't worry, they're gone, huh?

1006
01:32:34,805 --> 01:32:37,933
You know, I once had this buddy...

1007
01:32:38,108 --> 01:32:39,973
...named Mabhoko.

1008
01:32:40,744 --> 01:32:43,975
We used to hunt bush meat
together as kids, huh?

1009
01:32:44,782 --> 01:32:46,147
Baboons.

1010
01:32:46,317 --> 01:32:49,184
Baboons, they were
the hardest to catch. They're...

1011
01:32:50,287 --> 01:32:51,618
They're cunning.

1012
01:32:51,789 --> 01:32:53,882
Cunning creatures.

1013
01:32:54,158 --> 01:32:56,786
Fast, strong.

1014
01:32:56,961 --> 01:32:59,191
Got good eyesight.

1015
01:32:59,697 --> 01:33:03,724
We would always find them
by the smell of their shit.

1016
01:33:03,901 --> 01:33:09,032
And that's how we learned to track
your black terrorists in Angola, huh?

1017
01:33:13,110 --> 01:33:14,543
By the smell of your shit.

1018
01:33:15,579 --> 01:33:17,046
It's not...

1019
01:33:17,214 --> 01:33:19,944
It's not the same as a baboon's.

1020
01:33:22,186 --> 01:33:25,747
But, you know, after you skin it...

1021
01:33:27,057 --> 01:33:29,287
...the flesh of a baboon...

1022
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:31,960
...isn't that much different
than a man's, you know.

1023
01:33:35,366 --> 01:33:39,302
I'll tell you, I can track anything.

1024
01:33:51,549 --> 01:33:53,710
You risk my life like that again...

1025
01:33:59,089 --> 01:34:01,216
...and I'll peel your face
back off your head.

1026
01:34:03,727 --> 01:34:05,991
Do you understand?

1027
01:34:14,238 --> 01:34:16,297
Make us a fire.

1028
01:35:26,577 --> 01:35:28,169
What'd he say?

1029
01:35:28,345 --> 01:35:30,472
We are going the right way.

1030
01:35:37,621 --> 01:35:40,351
Hold up there, my man.
It's this way, huh?

1031
01:35:41,825 --> 01:35:44,020
Where do you think you are going?

1032
01:35:45,696 --> 01:35:47,357
Stop!

1033
01:35:47,631 --> 01:35:49,326
I said, stop!

1034
01:35:49,767 --> 01:35:51,325
He is not down there, all right?

1035
01:35:53,370 --> 01:35:57,033
All right. You're gonna need
some of that old discipline, huh?

1036
01:35:57,207 --> 01:35:59,471
Now you listen here, my boy,
and you listen well.

1037
01:35:59,643 --> 01:36:01,611
You are not going down there.
Are we clear?

1038
01:36:01,779 --> 01:36:03,406
You are not the master.

1039
01:36:03,580 --> 01:36:07,209
Right now, that is exactly what I am,
and you'd better remember it, Kaffir!

1040
01:36:22,366 --> 01:36:23,697
Don't you fucking move, huh?

1041
01:36:23,867 --> 01:36:25,835
Don't you move. Don't you move, huh?

1042
01:36:26,003 --> 01:36:28,335
- My son is there!
- Your son is gone!

1043
01:36:28,505 --> 01:36:29,836
- He is alive!
- He's gone!

1044
01:36:30,007 --> 01:36:32,567
He's alive! He's there
with those crazy people!

1045
01:36:33,777 --> 01:36:37,213
I am his father! His father!
I should have protected him!

1046
01:36:37,681 --> 01:36:41,583
I must go find him.
I cannot live without knowing!

1047
01:36:41,752 --> 01:36:43,982
Shoot me if you want, but I'm going.

1048
01:36:46,090 --> 01:36:49,548
Why should it matter,
I'm dead already.

1049
01:36:57,401 --> 01:36:59,665
We wait until dark, huh?

1050
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:30,231
Are you satisfied?

1051
01:37:33,203 --> 01:37:35,728
All right, come on.

1052
01:37:40,477 --> 01:37:42,672
--is fighting for Sierra Leone

1053
01:37:42,846 --> 01:37:45,906
RUF is fighting for Sierra Leone

1054
01:37:46,083 --> 01:37:49,018
Go tell my parents
They may see me no more

1055
01:37:49,186 --> 01:37:52,246
In the battlefield
We're fighting forever

1056
01:37:52,422 --> 01:37:55,323
Go tell my parents
They may see me no more

1057
01:37:55,492 --> 01:37:56,959
In the battlefield...

1058
01:37:59,530 --> 01:38:01,498
You are how old?

1059
01:38:01,665 --> 01:38:03,428
Me? I'm 31.

1060
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:05,761
And you have no wife?

1061
01:38:06,236 --> 01:38:09,103
- No.
- No children?

1062
01:38:10,274 --> 01:38:11,571
No.

1063
01:38:11,742 --> 01:38:13,369
And no home?

1064
01:38:13,544 --> 01:38:15,205
No.

1065
01:38:15,913 --> 01:38:18,313
But you have money, yes?

1066
01:38:18,482 --> 01:38:20,746
Yeah, some.

1067
01:38:20,918 --> 01:38:22,909
But not enough?

1068
01:38:25,422 --> 01:38:26,980
No.

1069
01:38:27,724 --> 01:38:32,218
If you get this diamond,
you will have enough money, yes?

1070
01:38:34,364 --> 01:38:35,388
Yes.

1071
01:38:35,566 --> 01:38:38,364
Then you will get
a wife and children?

1072
01:38:38,535 --> 01:38:39,934
Probably not, no.

1073
01:38:42,005 --> 01:38:42,994
What?

1074
01:38:45,108 --> 01:38:46,632
What?

1075
01:38:47,044 --> 01:38:49,103
I am confused.

1076
01:38:50,180 --> 01:38:51,647
Yeah?

1077
01:38:51,815 --> 01:38:54,613
That makes two of us, my bru.

1078
01:38:57,120 --> 01:39:00,612
Oh, Christ.
I've gotta quit smoking, huh?

1079
01:39:01,225 --> 01:39:03,193
Why don't you?

1080
01:39:03,460 --> 01:39:05,860
I'll tell you what, Solomon.

1081
01:39:06,129 --> 01:39:10,657
You find me this diamond,
and I'll quit right then and there, huh?

1082
01:39:18,075 --> 01:39:21,067
- You were born in Zimbabwe?
- Oh, yeah.

1083
01:39:21,245 --> 01:39:24,408
- Is it beautiful there?
- Sure you're not a reporter?

1084
01:39:24,815 --> 01:39:28,273
Because you ask a hell of a lot
of questions, my man.

1085
01:39:35,926 --> 01:39:39,623
My grandfather told
many stories of war.

1086
01:39:39,863 --> 01:39:42,696
How the Mende fought the Temne.

1087
01:39:42,866 --> 01:39:46,597
Or how two tribes would fight
when somebody had stolen a woman.

1088
01:39:56,680 --> 01:40:00,047
I understand white people
want our diamonds, yes?

1089
01:40:03,086 --> 01:40:06,817
But how can my own people
do this to each other?

1090
01:40:15,098 --> 01:40:17,157
I know good people...

1091
01:40:17,334 --> 01:40:20,201
...who say there is something
wrong with us...

1092
01:40:20,570 --> 01:40:21,730
...inside our black skin.

1093
01:40:21,905 --> 01:40:25,238
That we were better off
when the white man ruled.

1094
01:40:27,144 --> 01:40:29,942
But my son is good.

1095
01:40:31,515 --> 01:40:33,710
And when he grows up...

1096
01:40:33,884 --> 01:40:35,112
...and peace comes...

1097
01:40:39,122 --> 01:40:41,784
...this place will be a paradise.

1098
01:40:49,666 --> 01:40:52,134
We'll get your son back, huh?

1099
01:41:33,844 --> 01:41:36,176
Where is it exactly?

1100
01:41:37,714 --> 01:41:40,615
Through the camp, by the river.

1101
01:41:45,222 --> 01:41:46,917
Christ.

1102
01:41:47,391 --> 01:41:49,018
Okay.

1103
01:41:49,659 --> 01:41:51,524
I'm gonna make contact
with the colonel.

1104
01:41:51,695 --> 01:41:53,219
He'll send in an air strike.

1105
01:41:53,663 --> 01:41:56,632
- What is that?
- A chopper, huh? An attack helicopter.

1106
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:59,325
- We use it as a diversion.
- What if my son is there?

1107
01:41:59,503 --> 01:42:00,800
- He isn't.
- How do you know?

1108
01:42:00,971 --> 01:42:04,566
I said we do it my way now, all right?
Don't fuck with me.

1109
01:42:14,484 --> 01:42:16,884
Cordell, it's Danny.

1110
01:42:17,054 --> 01:42:19,386
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Shut up and listen, all right?

1111
01:42:19,556 --> 01:42:22,423
You tell the colonel I've found the stone.

1112
01:42:22,592 --> 01:42:25,561
No, I haven't got it in my hands,
but I'm OP'ing its location.

1113
01:42:25,729 --> 01:42:27,321
It's a major rebel camp, my man.

1114
01:42:27,497 --> 01:42:29,863
You tell him to send in the dakadak.

1115
01:42:30,434 --> 01:42:33,301
Because I stole a GPS, that's how.

1116
01:42:33,470 --> 01:42:36,030
If you shut up and listen,
I could give the coordinates.

1117
01:42:36,473 --> 01:42:39,499
Zero-nine-zero-five-four-two-four, north.

1118
01:42:39,676 --> 01:42:44,238
Three-two-seven-two-nine
three-zero-five-zero, east.

1119
01:42:44,414 --> 01:42:46,678
I'll call back at midnight to confirm.

1120
01:42:49,453 --> 01:42:52,388
You can look all night,
my friend, right?

1121
01:42:52,556 --> 01:42:55,218
I promise you he is not there.

1122
01:43:00,464 --> 01:43:02,659
They're coming in the morning, all right?

1123
01:43:02,833 --> 01:43:05,267
No movement, my friend. You stay still.

1124
01:43:07,204 --> 01:43:09,638
When it gets dark,
then we move in closer.

1125
01:43:31,795 --> 01:43:34,787
Solomon. Shit.

1126
01:43:45,575 --> 01:43:46,974
I can do it.

1127
01:43:47,144 --> 01:43:48,236
- Help me.
- Help him.

1128
01:43:48,411 --> 01:43:50,470
Thank you, Papa.

1129
01:44:32,422 --> 01:44:34,652
Hey, you smell.

1130
01:44:35,859 --> 01:44:37,326
That's fine.

1131
01:44:49,639 --> 01:44:51,607
- Ready? I'm winning.
- Okay, let's go.

1132
01:44:51,775 --> 01:44:53,436
Play, man.

1133
01:44:55,011 --> 01:44:57,912
- Play. Play the card.
- Play.

1134
01:45:24,708 --> 01:45:25,834
Dia.

1135
01:45:28,878 --> 01:45:30,573
Leave me alone.

1136
01:45:31,615 --> 01:45:34,846
- Dia. I'm your papa. Come with me.
- Hey.

1137
01:45:35,018 --> 01:45:36,747
- Dia.
- Get away from me.

1138
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:38,717
- Dia. Dia!
- I do not know you. Traitor!

1139
01:45:39,089 --> 01:45:41,580
- Enemy! Enemy!
- What the hell are you doing?

1140
01:45:41,758 --> 01:45:42,986
- What are you doing?
- I don't know you!

1141
01:45:43,159 --> 01:45:44,456
- What's wrong?
- I hate you!

1142
01:45:44,628 --> 01:45:46,357
- Dia, come with me!
- I hate you!

1143
01:45:46,529 --> 01:45:48,053
Get away from me!

1144
01:45:50,533 --> 01:45:52,398
- Get him!
- Don't shoot!

1145
01:45:52,902 --> 01:45:55,132
- Don't shoot! Don't--! Don't shoot!
- I hate you!

1146
01:45:55,305 --> 01:45:57,205
- Fisherman! Traitor!
- Don't shoot!

1147
01:45:57,374 --> 01:45:59,604
Get away from me!

1148
01:46:06,716 --> 01:46:08,877
I knew you would come back.

1149
01:46:09,352 --> 01:46:12,844
I have dug and dug and dug,
but I've found nothing.

1150
01:46:13,023 --> 01:46:14,923
Nothing.

1151
01:46:15,191 --> 01:46:16,681
Dig, dig, dig!

1152
01:46:16,860 --> 01:46:19,158
You will find it for me.

1153
01:46:20,130 --> 01:46:22,428
You will dig up
what you have come back for.

1154
01:46:22,599 --> 01:46:23,623
No.

1155
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:26,234
Why should the diamond
go to the foreign devils?

1156
01:46:26,970 --> 01:46:30,235
We will use it
to make the country strong.

1157
01:46:30,707 --> 01:46:33,301
RUF is fighting for the people!

1158
01:46:35,645 --> 01:46:38,739
RUF is fighting for Sierra Leone!

1159
01:46:41,584 --> 01:46:43,313
Pick it up.

1160
01:46:44,521 --> 01:46:47,490
Why? You are going to kill me anyway.

1161
01:46:47,657 --> 01:46:50,751
I do not need to kill you,
Solomon Vandy.

1162
01:46:53,596 --> 01:46:55,791
If you do not bring me the diamond...

1163
01:46:55,965 --> 01:46:58,195
...I will find the rest of your family.

1164
01:46:58,368 --> 01:47:00,802
Just as I have found your son.

1165
01:47:01,905 --> 01:47:05,272
I will rape your wife
in front of your eyes...

1166
01:47:06,076 --> 01:47:08,374
...slit her throat...

1167
01:47:08,978 --> 01:47:11,344
...and I will keep your daughters
for myself.

1168
01:47:16,753 --> 01:47:19,187
You think I am a devil...

1169
01:47:19,356 --> 01:47:21,688
...but only because I have lived in hell.

1170
01:47:23,326 --> 01:47:25,988
I want to get out.

1171
01:47:26,596 --> 01:47:28,689
You will help me.

1172
01:47:31,534 --> 01:47:32,831
I don't remember.

1173
01:47:33,002 --> 01:47:35,971
Find it or your family will die!

1174
01:47:36,906 --> 01:47:38,771
Now pick it up!

1175
01:47:54,324 --> 01:47:55,757
- Go!
- Bastards!

1176
01:47:55,925 --> 01:47:57,290
Shoot it!

1177
01:48:02,265 --> 01:48:03,254
Dia!

1178
01:48:15,345 --> 01:48:17,540
Come, boy. Come. This way. This way.

1179
01:48:18,415 --> 01:48:19,643
Dia!

1180
01:48:42,539 --> 01:48:44,131
Colonel, we think Archer's there.

1181
01:48:44,307 --> 01:48:47,140
I don't give a damn who's down there.
Kill them all.

1182
01:48:57,487 --> 01:48:58,749
Dia!

1183
01:49:13,503 --> 01:49:14,800
I'm coming!

1184
01:49:18,341 --> 01:49:20,002
- Dia!
- Bastard!

1185
01:49:43,166 --> 01:49:44,531
No!

1186
01:50:04,621 --> 01:50:05,952
Dia!

1187
01:51:12,188 --> 01:51:15,123
- We found his digger, sir.
- Keep him close.

1188
01:51:17,093 --> 01:51:19,288
- Danny boy.
- Colonel.

1189
01:51:19,462 --> 01:51:22,829
- Thanks for calling it in.
- Yeah, yeah. Always happy to help, huh?

1190
01:51:22,999 --> 01:51:26,332
So where is it? The stone?

1191
01:51:26,502 --> 01:51:28,436
We split, huh? Fifty-fifty, all right?

1192
01:51:28,605 --> 01:51:30,232
Look around you, Danny boy.

1193
01:51:30,406 --> 01:51:33,375
You're not in a position
to be dictating terms.

1194
01:51:33,543 --> 01:51:35,636
Then you will never find it, sir.

1195
01:51:35,812 --> 01:51:37,439
That's correct.

1196
01:51:39,115 --> 01:51:41,743
- But he will.
- Come. Up.

1197
01:51:43,386 --> 01:51:45,616
Introduce me to your digger.

1198
01:51:47,190 --> 01:51:48,851
Solomon Vandy.

1199
01:51:49,025 --> 01:51:51,186
This is Colonel Coetzee.
He wants the diamond.

1200
01:51:51,361 --> 01:51:54,387
- No more than you.
- Fuck.

1201
01:51:54,564 --> 01:51:56,555
You gonna show us where it's hidden?

1202
01:51:59,235 --> 01:52:00,930
Does he speak English?

1203
01:52:01,104 --> 01:52:04,130
He will only tell me, sir.
I promise you that.

1204
01:52:04,974 --> 01:52:08,034
- Let me talk to him, huh?
- Go on.

1205
01:52:14,784 --> 01:52:17,150
All right, my friend.

1206
01:52:17,320 --> 01:52:19,254
End of the line here, huh?

1207
01:52:19,422 --> 01:52:22,687
- You just tell him where it is, all right?
- I do not trust him.

1208
01:52:22,859 --> 01:52:26,295
I don't trust him either,
but we haven't got much of a choice here.

1209
01:52:27,997 --> 01:52:31,125
I promise you
he will shoot us both in the head.

1210
01:52:31,567 --> 01:52:34,331
Right, tell him, huh?
Tell him where it is, huh?

1211
01:52:34,504 --> 01:52:37,098
- Go on. Come on.
- I'm not feeling the love, Danny.

1212
01:52:38,307 --> 01:52:41,140
All right.
No more messing about, all right?

1213
01:52:41,310 --> 01:52:44,302
I said tell him where it is!
Tell him where it is! Now!

1214
01:52:44,480 --> 01:52:46,141
Tell him!

1215
01:52:47,316 --> 01:52:49,113
- No.
- Fucking--

1216
01:52:49,285 --> 01:52:51,981
Danny, there are other ways
to do this, okay?

1217
01:52:52,155 --> 01:52:53,782
Yeah, yeah.

1218
01:53:01,964 --> 01:53:04,956
- If he tells us, do we have a deal, sir?
- Seventy-thirty.

1219
01:53:05,134 --> 01:53:07,534
Sixty-forty. I've already lined up a buyer.

1220
01:53:07,704 --> 01:53:09,365
Agreed.

1221
01:53:14,544 --> 01:53:16,102
Come here.

1222
01:53:18,681 --> 01:53:22,117
This is his son. Vandy will do
whatever you want for his sake, all right?

1223
01:53:22,285 --> 01:53:27,052
Danny, you're a pisser, man. Well done.
Boys, we move out.

1224
01:53:29,826 --> 01:53:32,124
What do you say, Mr. Vandy?

1225
01:53:32,595 --> 01:53:35,496
- You ready to take a walk?
- Come on.

1226
01:53:41,771 --> 01:53:43,363
Come on.

1227
01:53:56,319 --> 01:53:59,413
So who's the buyer?
I'm guessing London.

1228
01:53:59,622 --> 01:54:02,887
Well, they no longer accept
conflict diamonds, huh?

1229
01:54:03,059 --> 01:54:05,527
Wouldn't hurt to interest
some other parties.

1230
01:54:06,062 --> 01:54:09,054
- Start a bidding war.
- What, one war's not enough for you, huh?

1231
01:54:09,999 --> 01:54:11,694
I missed you, Danny.

1232
01:54:12,001 --> 01:54:16,165
See? It is here.
He has tried to find it.

1233
01:54:16,339 --> 01:54:19,035
All right, Mr. Vandy.
Time for you to start digging.

1234
01:54:34,090 --> 01:54:36,354
Hey, boet, have you got a smoke?

1235
01:54:36,826 --> 01:54:38,726
Smoking will kill you.

1236
01:54:39,495 --> 01:54:40,985
Sorry.

1237
01:54:44,066 --> 01:54:45,966
It's all right.

1238
01:54:46,135 --> 01:54:48,262
Time I quit smoking anyway,
huh, Solomon?

1239
01:55:02,785 --> 01:55:04,116
- It's gone.
- What?

1240
01:55:04,287 --> 01:55:06,380
Someone has taken it.

1241
01:55:07,490 --> 01:55:11,256
This is where I buried it.
It isn't here.

1242
01:55:11,727 --> 01:55:15,094
Well, then there's no reason
for any of you to stay alive. Is there?

1243
01:55:19,435 --> 01:55:21,096
Wait, wait, wait.

1244
01:55:21,270 --> 01:55:23,500
I know, I know. I know where it is.

1245
01:55:23,973 --> 01:55:25,964
- I know where it is.
- It better be there.

1246
01:55:31,147 --> 01:55:32,136
Yes.

1247
01:55:32,315 --> 01:55:35,682
Oh, here, here.
It is here.

1248
01:55:35,852 --> 01:55:37,513
- Yeah? Yeah, there it is.
- Yes.

1249
01:55:38,688 --> 01:55:40,087
Fuck!

1250
01:55:58,741 --> 01:56:00,675
TIA, huh, Danny?

1251
01:56:02,078 --> 01:56:03,670
TIA.

1252
01:56:10,586 --> 01:56:14,044
Keep digging, huh?
They'll be here any second. Come on.

1253
01:56:16,259 --> 01:56:17,521
Keep digging.

1254
01:56:30,373 --> 01:56:33,103
- It had better be there, huh?
- Yes, yes.

1255
01:56:36,145 --> 01:56:37,737
Have you got it?

1256
01:56:39,181 --> 01:56:42,446
- Have you got it, huh?
- Yes, got it. Oh, yes.

1257
01:56:43,886 --> 01:56:45,148
Oh, yes.

1258
01:56:47,323 --> 01:56:48,915
Solomon.

1259
01:56:55,731 --> 01:56:58,700
Dia, what are you doing?

1260
01:56:59,201 --> 01:57:00,691
Dia.

1261
01:57:03,039 --> 01:57:04,939
What are you doing?

1262
01:57:09,812 --> 01:57:11,109
Of the proud Mende tribe.

1263
01:57:17,053 --> 01:57:21,922
You are a good boy
who loves soccer and school.

1264
01:57:24,226 --> 01:57:27,354
Your mother loves you so much.

1265
01:57:29,799 --> 01:57:32,597
She waits by the fire making plantains...

1266
01:57:32,768 --> 01:57:35,430
...and red palm oil stew
with your sister N'Yanda...

1267
01:57:37,707 --> 01:57:39,971
...and the new baby.

1268
01:57:48,884 --> 01:57:51,148
The cows wait for you.

1269
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:57,122
And Babu, the wild dog
who minds no one but you.

1270
01:57:59,695 --> 01:58:03,028
I know they made you do bad things...

1271
01:58:03,199 --> 01:58:05,667
...but you are not a bad boy.

1272
01:58:08,871 --> 01:58:11,271
I am your father...

1273
01:58:12,975 --> 01:58:15,273
...who loves you.

1274
01:58:16,545 --> 01:58:20,311
And you will come home with me
and be my son again.

1275
01:58:45,741 --> 01:58:48,107
Solomon, we've got to move, huh?

1276
01:58:48,277 --> 01:58:49,835
We've got to--

1277
01:58:53,015 --> 01:58:55,711
Go, go! Move!

1278
01:58:58,487 --> 01:59:00,045
Move. Move.

1279
01:59:00,222 --> 01:59:01,519
Move, move, move!

1280
01:59:01,690 --> 01:59:04,716
Move! Move! Move!

1281
01:59:06,328 --> 01:59:07,556
How far?

1282
01:59:07,730 --> 01:59:09,789
There's an airstrip
at the top of that gorge.

1283
01:59:09,965 --> 01:59:12,058
A plane will meet us, huh?

1284
01:59:12,468 --> 01:59:14,834
Hey, stop. Stop.

1285
01:59:17,106 --> 01:59:21,099
Give it to me.
Come on, give it to me, huh?

1286
01:59:28,617 --> 01:59:31,677
Keep moving. They'll be tracking us.

1287
01:59:37,993 --> 01:59:40,052
Nabil, where are you?

1288
01:59:41,130 --> 01:59:43,758
I'm nearly there.
Tell me what's happening.

1289
01:59:43,933 --> 01:59:47,391
We're about 10 K's out, huh?
We've got it, my friend.

1290
01:59:47,570 --> 01:59:49,470
- Who is we?
- The fisherman and his son.

1291
01:59:49,638 --> 01:59:51,230
Lose them.

1292
02:00:05,387 --> 02:00:07,480
It's at the top of that ridge there, huh?

1293
02:00:07,656 --> 02:00:08,953
You must stop and rest.

1294
02:00:09,125 --> 02:00:11,958
What? And give up the damn stone?

1295
02:00:12,128 --> 02:00:14,187
Keep moving. Come on.

1296
02:00:48,831 --> 02:00:51,163
Come. Come, come.

1297
02:01:38,280 --> 02:01:40,578
I can't. Stop.

1298
02:01:40,749 --> 02:01:42,808
- Okay.
- Stop.

1299
02:02:11,280 --> 02:02:12,372
Come on.

1300
02:02:12,982 --> 02:02:15,576
No! God, no. Stop.

1301
02:02:16,685 --> 02:02:20,018
Christ. No more. No more.

1302
02:03:03,966 --> 02:03:05,661
Take it, huh?

1303
02:03:08,070 --> 02:03:11,267
- Mr. Archer--
- Take it, take it.

1304
02:03:18,347 --> 02:03:20,110
I thought you would steal it from me.

1305
02:03:21,950 --> 02:03:25,579
Yeah, yeah, it occurred to me, huh?

1306
02:03:36,532 --> 02:03:38,159
Listen...

1307
02:03:41,136 --> 02:03:43,536
...this is Maddy's card, huh?

1308
02:03:43,706 --> 02:03:45,867
You call her when
you get to Conakry, all right?

1309
02:03:50,112 --> 02:03:52,080
And don't trust that pilot for a second.

1310
02:03:52,247 --> 02:03:55,307
You point this at his head
if he fucks around, all right?

1311
02:03:55,484 --> 02:03:56,951
I can carry you.

1312
02:04:09,865 --> 02:04:11,332
You take your boy home, huh?

1313
02:04:16,505 --> 02:04:19,167
You take him home, huh?

1314
02:04:23,712 --> 02:04:25,475
- Go! Go!
- Go. Come on.

1315
02:04:26,315 --> 02:04:27,407
Go on!

1316
02:04:33,155 --> 02:04:35,020
Come on. Come on.

1317
02:04:41,830 --> 02:04:44,196
Archer, you're a dead man!

1318
02:04:44,366 --> 02:04:46,197
Yeah, yeah.

1319
02:05:16,899 --> 02:05:18,264
Dia.

1320
02:05:39,488 --> 02:05:40,648
Hello. Maddy Bowen.

1321
02:05:40,889 --> 02:05:42,720
Yeah.

1322
02:05:43,058 --> 02:05:44,719
Thought I'd never call, huh?

1323
02:05:45,627 --> 02:05:49,688
And I'm so glad you did.
Excuse me.

1324
02:05:51,667 --> 02:05:52,827
When am I gonna see you?

1325
02:05:53,969 --> 02:05:59,703
Maddy, I want you to do me
one more favor, huh?

1326
02:06:00,409 --> 02:06:04,937
I want you to go meet Solomon
in Conakry.

1327
02:06:05,147 --> 02:06:07,843
In Guinea?
Why do you want me to go to Guinea?

1328
02:06:10,853 --> 02:06:12,912
We found his son...

1329
02:06:13,889 --> 02:06:17,290
...but he's gonna need some help,
you understand?

1330
02:06:18,060 --> 02:06:19,152
Maddy?

1331
02:06:21,964 --> 02:06:23,829
You're hurt.

1332
02:06:24,466 --> 02:06:25,524
Are you hurt?

1333
02:06:25,701 --> 02:06:28,864
Yeah, well, I've got
a little problem here.

1334
02:06:33,442 --> 02:06:37,139
Okay. You--
You tell me where you are.

1335
02:06:40,415 --> 02:06:41,439
Archer?

1336
02:06:53,595 --> 02:06:58,328
I'm looking at an incredible view
right now.

1337
02:06:59,735 --> 02:07:01,362
I wish you were here, Maddy.

1338
02:07:01,537 --> 02:07:05,200
Okay, then I'm coming to be with you.
You just tell me where you are.

1339
02:07:08,410 --> 02:07:09,741
I don't think so.

1340
02:07:09,912 --> 02:07:13,245
Are you still in Kono? Because I can
get someone there to help you.

1341
02:07:13,415 --> 02:07:17,681
Maddy, you find someplace safe
for the boy, all right?

1342
02:07:17,853 --> 02:07:20,253
And keep him out of sight.

1343
02:07:20,856 --> 02:07:23,586
And get Solomon to London.

1344
02:07:26,728 --> 02:07:29,492
He's bringing something with him.

1345
02:07:30,165 --> 02:07:32,099
But he's gonna need your help.

1346
02:07:33,335 --> 02:07:35,166
Why aren't you bringing it yourself?

1347
02:07:36,672 --> 02:07:41,735
I'm saying it's a real story now.

1348
02:07:42,644 --> 02:07:44,373
And you can write the hell out of it.

1349
02:07:51,587 --> 02:07:54,112
I'm really happy I met you.

1350
02:07:55,691 --> 02:07:56,680
You know that?

1351
02:08:00,028 --> 02:08:02,155
Yeah, I'm...

1352
02:08:03,365 --> 02:08:06,425
I'm really happy I met you too.

1353
02:08:07,035 --> 02:08:11,028
And I wish I could be there with you.

1354
02:08:11,907 --> 02:08:13,875
That's all right.

1355
02:08:16,411 --> 02:08:18,811
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.

1356
02:09:12,434 --> 02:09:14,766
When we get to the stairs,
you just keep walking...

1357
02:09:14,936 --> 02:09:16,961
...and I'll wait for you here.

1358
02:09:17,539 --> 02:09:19,063
You're not coming.

1359
02:09:19,241 --> 02:09:22,506
I'm not here. Good luck.

1360
02:09:44,166 --> 02:09:46,828
You must understand, Mr. Vandy...

1361
02:09:47,002 --> 02:09:53,066
...that your diamond could have ended up
nowhere else but with us.

1362
02:09:56,380 --> 02:09:59,345
- It is not enough.
- I assure you, 2 million pounds...

1363
02:09:59,515 --> 02:10:03,380
...is more than anyone else will offer you
for that stone under the circumstances.

1364
02:10:03,550 --> 02:10:06,250
I want what was promised to me
by Mr. Archer.

1365
02:10:09,725 --> 02:10:12,250
- What was promised to you?
- My family.

1366
02:10:12,595 --> 02:10:14,585
When they are here,
you will get the stone.

1367
02:10:15,265 --> 02:10:16,890
I will have the money too.

1368
02:10:18,200 --> 02:10:19,725
Well, may I see what I'm buying?

1369
02:10:19,900 --> 02:10:22,665
You will get the stone
once my family is here.

1370
02:10:23,440 --> 02:10:25,235
How do I even know you've got it?

1371
02:12:33,135 --> 02:12:35,900
Can you comment on the diamonds
mined in Sierra Leone?

1372
02:12:36,070 --> 02:12:39,975
I'm not going to comment
on some sensationalist magazine article.

1373
02:12:40,140 --> 02:12:42,735
- What about Liberia?
- No comment. No comment.

1374
02:12:42,910 --> 02:12:45,310
- Mr. Van De Kaap--
- That's all I have to say.

1375
02:12:45,480 --> 02:12:46,880
The natural resources
of a country...

1376
02:12:48,885 --> 02:12:51,855
...are the property of its people.
They are not ours to steal...

1377
02:12:53,190 --> 02:12:58,650
...or exploit in the name of our comfort,
our corporations, or our consumerism.

1378
02:13:08,570 --> 02:13:10,630
They're ready for you, sir.

1379
02:13:12,140 --> 02:13:14,540
The Third World is not a world apart.

1380
02:13:14,710 --> 02:13:19,375
And the witness you will hear today
speaks on its behalf.

1381
02:13:19,545 --> 02:13:23,415
Let us hear the voice of that world.
Let us learn from that voice.

1382
02:13:23,585 --> 02:13:27,110
And let us ignore it no more.

1383
02:13:27,290 --> 02:13:30,620
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Solomon Vandy.

1383
02:13:31,305 --> 02:13:37,243
