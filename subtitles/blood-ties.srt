2
00:01:05,027 --> 00:01:07,396
So there's a nigger,
a kike and a wop

3
00:01:07,397 --> 00:01:09,832
and they get surrounded by Indians.

4
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:13,169
The chief walks to them.
He says, "Listen, we're gonna kill you,

5
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,970
"we're gonna skin you,
we're gonna boil you.

6
00:01:14,971 --> 00:01:16,405
"We're gonna make a
canoe out of you.

7
00:01:16,406 --> 00:01:19,742
"But you get one final request."

8
00:01:19,743 --> 00:01:23,846
So the chief walks up to the nigger, and
of course he orders a bucket of chicken.

9
00:01:23,847 --> 00:01:25,981
He eats it, he's killed.

10
00:01:25,982 --> 00:01:30,219
They skin him, they boil him, and
they make a canoe out of him.

11
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,457
So the chief goes up to the
Jew, "What do you wish for?"

12
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:36,959
He says "I'll have
a knish and a bagel."

13
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,861
But he takes his time eating it.

14
00:01:38,862 --> 00:01:41,163
Then they kill him,
they skin him, they boil him,

15
00:01:41,164 --> 00:01:43,432
they make a canoe out of him.

16
00:01:43,433 --> 00:01:46,202
And finally, the chief
walks up to the wop.

17
00:01:46,203 --> 00:01:47,470
He says, "What do you want?"

18
00:01:47,471 --> 00:01:50,506
The Italian says, "I want a fork."

19
00:01:50,507 --> 00:01:53,242
The chief says,
"What do you want a fork for?

20
00:01:53,243 --> 00:01:55,010
"You don't want something else?"

21
00:01:55,011 --> 00:01:58,314
The Italian says,
"No, give me a fork!"

22
00:01:58,315 --> 00:02:00,216
He says, "We don't have a fork!"

23
00:02:00,217 --> 00:02:02,083
He says, "Find me a fucking fork!"

24
00:02:03,886 --> 00:02:05,954
So the chief goes out,

25
00:02:07,056 --> 00:02:12,061
finds him a fork, he brings
it over, hands it to him.

26
00:02:12,062 --> 00:02:15,998
He walks straight up to the chief.
He says, "Here's your fucking canoe!

27
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:18,134
"Ma, I'm coming!

28
00:02:18,135 --> 00:02:20,595
"Here's your fucking canoe!"

29
00:02:23,272 --> 00:02:25,373
Get the fuck down!
Get the fuck down!

30
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,135
Will somebody shut off
that fucking music?

31
00:03:56,632 --> 00:03:58,299
Take it easy.

32
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,048
You seem a little confused.

33
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:16,718
Let me see if I could clear
things up for you a little bit.

34
00:04:19,355 --> 00:04:23,325
This parking ticket

35
00:04:23,326 --> 00:04:26,395
belongs to a van that's registered
to one of your garages.

36
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:28,664
It was found at the crime scene.

37
00:04:28,665 --> 00:04:30,966
It was found two hours ago.

38
00:04:30,967 --> 00:04:32,902
One of my vans was stolen.
Yeah?

39
00:04:32,903 --> 00:04:34,403
Did you report it stolen?

40
00:04:34,404 --> 00:04:35,971
I didn't have to. It was found
after a couple of days.

41
00:04:35,972 --> 00:04:38,240
Oh, you didn't have to.
You found it.

42
00:04:38,241 --> 00:04:40,209
You're a lucky guy.

43
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,278
I don't know how it got there.

44
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,379
The fucking shit was stolen.

45
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,949
And are you aware of the fact
that that van and others like it

46
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,651
have been linked
to a series of robberies

47
00:04:48,652 --> 00:04:50,352
over the past
eight months all over

48
00:04:50,353 --> 00:04:52,221
from Bay Ridge to Kings Point?

49
00:04:52,222 --> 00:04:54,223
I don't know what
you're talking about.

50
00:04:54,224 --> 00:04:55,624
Mmm-hmm.

51
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:58,060
What's this?
Is this your firearm?

52
00:04:58,061 --> 00:04:59,595
It's never been fired.

53
00:04:59,596 --> 00:05:00,996
Is it registered?

54
00:05:00,997 --> 00:05:02,364
It's eight years old.

55
00:05:02,365 --> 00:05:05,267
Answer the question, is it registered?
You're a funny man, you know that?

56
00:05:05,268 --> 00:05:07,569
Yeah, I got a sense of humor, sure.
Yeah, I noticed.

57
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,438
Unregistered firearm,
take it downtown.

58
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:12,141
Listen, you got nothing
on me, all right?

59
00:05:12,142 --> 00:05:13,307
I quit years ago.

60
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,680
So get off my back.
Come on.

61
00:05:17,681 --> 00:05:21,183
I'm working on cars now,
with my brothers.

62
00:05:21,184 --> 00:05:24,253
I spent two fucking
years in the joint.

63
00:05:24,254 --> 00:05:28,222
You think... You think I'm
gonna give my family up again?

64
00:05:32,194 --> 00:05:34,829
Go 'head, look.
You ain't gonna find shit.

65
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,238
All these... All these
weeks you're telling me...

66
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:45,174
All these weeks you're
telling me it's a guarantee.

67
00:05:45,175 --> 00:05:46,408
There's no chance it could
be anywhere else but here.

68
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:47,743
No, well...
Yeah, and what do we find?

69
00:05:47,744 --> 00:05:49,645
So, it wasn't here, I...

70
00:05:49,646 --> 00:05:51,647
There's no point. He doesn't have
a permit for his gun. That's it!

71
00:05:51,648 --> 00:05:54,016
He's got no money on him,
no nothing!

72
00:05:54,017 --> 00:05:55,751
We've got a parking ticket
that connects him

73
00:05:55,752 --> 00:05:57,019
directly to the crime scene...
Oh, give it up, Frank.

74
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,421
Give it up.

75
00:05:59,422 --> 00:06:02,558
We blew our warrants,
we blew our arrests.

76
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:05,427
He goes away
for six months. That's it.

77
00:06:05,428 --> 00:06:06,662
We got one other guy.
You wanna talk to him?

78
00:06:06,663 --> 00:06:08,596
He's down at the morgue.

79
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,219
You know that girl back there?

80
00:06:42,097 --> 00:06:43,731
All right, now.

81
00:06:49,104 --> 00:06:51,485
You're really out.

82
00:07:28,377 --> 00:07:29,810
That's Frank.

83
00:07:37,786 --> 00:07:39,188
How's Pop?

84
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:41,256
Uh, it depends on the day.

85
00:07:41,257 --> 00:07:42,825
They took him off the
ventilator though this morning.

86
00:07:42,826 --> 00:07:43,826
You wanna go see your kids?

87
00:07:43,827 --> 00:07:46,527
No. I wanna see Pop.

88
00:07:58,173 --> 00:08:00,142
Pop, what are you doing up?

89
00:08:00,143 --> 00:08:02,144
That's you, boy, that's you!

90
00:08:02,145 --> 00:08:03,545
How you doing, Pop?

91
00:08:03,546 --> 00:08:06,148
Get over here,
you big son of a gun.

92
00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:07,949
Oh, buddy, oh, buddy.

93
00:08:10,886 --> 00:08:12,453
I'm doing great.

94
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:15,624
I can go four rounds.

95
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,326
They just took out one lung.

96
00:08:17,327 --> 00:08:20,329
I hope the geniuses
left the good one.

97
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,230
- I'm breathin' pretty good, huh?
- Yeah.

98
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:22,431
Hey, Frankie boy.

99
00:08:22,432 --> 00:08:23,565
Hey, Pop.
Hey.

100
00:08:23,566 --> 00:08:24,700
You look good.
Hi.

101
00:08:24,701 --> 00:08:26,335
Yeah. You shouldn't
be up, so come on.

102
00:08:26,336 --> 00:08:27,569
I know, I shouldn't.
Get in here, now.

103
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,403
Mother Teresa.
Come on.

104
00:08:33,308 --> 00:08:37,346
I'll tell ya what, they got
two, three nurses here,

105
00:08:37,347 --> 00:08:40,849
and I'll bet ya, I can be as
good as I was, at least once.

106
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,518
Mmm, okay.

107
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:44,186
So, what are the doctors saying?

108
00:08:44,187 --> 00:08:46,488
The doctors say, they say, uh...

109
00:08:46,489 --> 00:08:47,789
They say, "You got insurance?"

110
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,159
And they say,
"Wait until you get better."

111
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,627
I'll be out soon.

112
00:08:51,628 --> 00:08:54,163
Yeah, I don't know why I ask you.
I'm gonna go ask them myself, okay?

113
00:08:54,164 --> 00:08:55,424
Yeah, sure.

114
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,334
I'm gonna let you two talk.

115
00:08:59,335 --> 00:09:00,801
Love you, pal.

116
00:09:10,712 --> 00:09:12,748
You're not too
talkative, huh, buddy.

117
00:09:12,749 --> 00:09:15,284
I mean it's all right.

118
00:09:15,285 --> 00:09:16,718
It's all right. I mean...

119
00:09:16,719 --> 00:09:18,353
The good thing is you're out.

120
00:09:18,354 --> 00:09:21,823
I'm just on leave, Pop.
It's a furlough.

121
00:09:21,824 --> 00:09:24,244
I don't get a job,
they keep me in.

122
00:09:26,361 --> 00:09:27,461
Yeah.

123
00:09:28,697 --> 00:09:30,118
It's a long time you was gone.

124
00:09:52,621 --> 00:09:55,089
Frank, been a long time.

125
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,460
Kids are on the couch.

126
00:10:17,846 --> 00:10:19,815
Kids, this is your father.

127
00:10:19,816 --> 00:10:21,037
Come on, get up.

128
00:10:26,955 --> 00:10:29,658
Hey, what're you doing?
It's me.

129
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:31,425
I'm your father.

130
00:10:32,828 --> 00:10:34,862
Come here, give me a kiss.

131
00:10:52,014 --> 00:10:53,282
We can take it back.

132
00:10:53,283 --> 00:10:55,116
No, it's okay. Thanks.

133
00:10:57,586 --> 00:10:58,786
Thanks!

134
00:11:00,856 --> 00:11:02,391
Mom, can I go play these?

135
00:11:02,392 --> 00:11:04,492
Of course, sweetie.
Go ahead.

136
00:11:10,465 --> 00:11:13,035
So, I, uh, I hear
you been left back?

137
00:11:13,036 --> 00:11:14,836
Yeah.
Yeah? You gotta buckle down.

138
00:11:14,837 --> 00:11:16,338
Yeah.

139
00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:17,972
"Yeah, yeah."

140
00:11:19,608 --> 00:11:21,549
It's not enough to say
"yeah" all the time.

141
00:11:22,077 --> 00:11:24,345
He goes out every night.
You listen to your mother.

142
00:11:24,346 --> 00:11:27,082
You screw up in school, that's
how you stay in the sewer.

143
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,981
Frank!
Come on, join.

144
00:12:02,117 --> 00:12:04,018
No.
Come on!

145
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:10,224
I taught him everything he knows.

146
00:13:41,917 --> 00:13:44,184
Let me ask you something, Frank.

147
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,190
How close could you be with this
guy I've known you for 12 years.

148
00:13:48,191 --> 00:13:50,591
You never mentioned him
to me once.

149
00:13:51,593 --> 00:13:52,860
Not once.

150
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:58,600
Well, we... We, uh,
we had some problems.

151
00:13:58,601 --> 00:14:02,136
But that's behind us.

152
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,041
I just wanna try to help.

153
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,613
You've always been
good to me, Frank.

154
00:14:11,614 --> 00:14:13,548
You know I trust you.

155
00:14:13,549 --> 00:14:16,718
It's just, um, I don't
want any trouble here.

156
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:18,185
I understand that.

157
00:14:23,825 --> 00:14:26,260
It would really help me out.

158
00:14:26,261 --> 00:14:27,829
Can you help me?

159
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,263
I might, yes.

160
00:14:30,065 --> 00:14:31,867
I still need to ask Fabio.

161
00:14:31,868 --> 00:14:34,536
He is the one who runs the
joint here, you know.

162
00:14:34,537 --> 00:14:36,872
That's who calls the shots.

163
00:14:36,873 --> 00:14:39,106
I'll talk to him.
Okay, thanks.

164
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:44,979
Clean this spill here. When you are
done, go and clean the bathroom. Okay?

165
00:14:52,687 --> 00:14:56,825
I'm gonna try to, uh, find
you a better mattress, too.

166
00:14:56,826 --> 00:14:58,560
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

167
00:14:58,561 --> 00:15:00,095
All right, well, you know,
make yourself at home, dude.

168
00:15:00,096 --> 00:15:01,930
Oh, the toilet's broken

169
00:15:01,931 --> 00:15:05,100
so, if you wanna flush it,

170
00:15:05,101 --> 00:15:07,235
you gotta jiggle the, the bar
and if that, that doesn't work,

171
00:15:07,236 --> 00:15:09,004
you gotta lift the ball inside.
Yeah, no problem.

172
00:15:09,005 --> 00:15:10,939
But I'm serious about this
because the whole thing will...

173
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,480
Will flood if you don't...
All right.

174
00:15:12,908 --> 00:15:14,288
I got it. It's good.

175
00:15:17,946 --> 00:15:20,047
You want a beer?

176
00:15:36,131 --> 00:15:37,965
Here, an ashtray.

177
00:15:40,335 --> 00:15:42,337
You know those guys?

178
00:15:42,338 --> 00:15:43,438
No.

179
00:15:49,277 --> 00:15:51,812
So, uh, how was
first day at the lot?

180
00:15:54,716 --> 00:15:56,316
It was okay.

181
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:03,925
It's a start though, right?

182
00:16:03,926 --> 00:16:06,794
I'm sure something...
Something better's gonna come up.

183
00:16:17,172 --> 00:16:20,774
These guys don't look familiar to you?
Frank, do me a favor.

184
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,946
Stranger?

185
00:16:57,947 --> 00:16:59,814
Jesus Christ, you scared me, man.

186
00:16:59,815 --> 00:17:02,651
What do you say, Chris!
What are you doing, man?

187
00:17:02,652 --> 00:17:03,852
Whoa!
Hey.

188
00:17:03,853 --> 00:17:05,420
It's about fucking time, man.

189
00:17:05,421 --> 00:17:06,921
How you're doing?
Look at you, man!

190
00:17:06,922 --> 00:17:09,290
Oh, man.
I'm doing all right now.

191
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,359
What about Big Sal?

192
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,429
Oh, man! You won't be seeing
him around here no more.

193
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,931
He bought a bar,
over in Manhattan.

194
00:17:16,932 --> 00:17:18,266
He's doing all right.

195
00:17:18,267 --> 00:17:20,435
I hear he plays poker
with the DA these days.

196
00:17:20,436 --> 00:17:23,056
Can you imagine?
That scumbag.

197
00:17:25,073 --> 00:17:27,253
What about you, Chris?
Any plans?

198
00:17:27,976 --> 00:17:29,943
Keep the judge happy.

199
00:18:00,108 --> 00:18:03,528
Here where it says "print" and then
the timing when she got here...

200
00:18:12,387 --> 00:18:16,089
I'm gonna... I'm also gonna give
you some forms to fill out.

201
00:18:18,493 --> 00:18:20,762
So, please fill these out.

202
00:18:20,763 --> 00:18:23,183
You keep the pen.
Thank you.

203
00:18:27,469 --> 00:18:29,804
What are you doing here?

204
00:18:29,805 --> 00:18:31,806
Well, I didn't know
you worked there.

205
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,442
I just wanted to see
how you was doing.

206
00:18:34,443 --> 00:18:37,146
What do you want from
me, huh? He's in jail.

207
00:18:37,147 --> 00:18:39,548
Don't you feel like you fucked
things up enough already?

208
00:18:39,647 --> 00:18:41,149
Hey, wait a second. He is the
one who fucked things up!

209
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,950
Get out of here!

210
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,987
I'm sorry.

211
00:18:50,825 --> 00:18:53,160
You been following me for weeks.

212
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,197
I've seen you.

213
00:18:59,534 --> 00:19:01,468
What do you want, Frank?

214
00:19:03,438 --> 00:19:05,874
Okay.

215
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,308
I been thinking about you a lot.

216
00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:08,777
I been thinking about
what's happened between us.

217
00:19:08,778 --> 00:19:10,478
I been thinking about
how it ended,

218
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:12,247
and I've been worried about you,

219
00:19:12,248 --> 00:19:13,915
and I wanted to see if we
could be friends, okay?

220
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,117
I just wanted to see
if I could be there for you

221
00:19:16,118 --> 00:19:19,253
if you needed me sometime.
That's all I wanted, okay?

222
00:19:22,257 --> 00:19:24,024
Yeah?
Yeah.

223
00:19:27,996 --> 00:19:30,136
Can you be seen with me now?

224
00:19:32,801 --> 00:19:34,102
Can you be seen
with the "colored girl"?

225
00:19:34,103 --> 00:19:36,204
Come on, that's not, I...

226
00:19:36,205 --> 00:19:37,405
You just said it yourself, that was
a long time ago. Yes, yes, yes.

227
00:19:37,406 --> 00:19:38,940
And that things are different now.

228
00:19:38,941 --> 00:19:40,321
Leave me alone.

229
00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:47,559
Don't ever come back here again.
Do you hear me?

230
00:20:13,608 --> 00:20:15,275
What's wrong?

231
00:20:17,879 --> 00:20:21,515
Natalie, what is it?
What's the matter?

232
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,084
$40 short.

233
00:20:25,553 --> 00:20:27,555
It's the second time in 10 days.

234
00:20:27,556 --> 00:20:28,990
I already had to spend $50

235
00:20:28,991 --> 00:20:30,525
out of my own pocket last week.

236
00:20:30,526 --> 00:20:33,461
You need help recounting it?
No.

237
00:20:33,462 --> 00:20:36,965
No, I already counted
three goddamned times. It's gone.

238
00:20:36,966 --> 00:20:38,600
Okay, so there's 40 bucks missing.

239
00:20:38,601 --> 00:20:40,001
It's not the end of the world.

240
00:20:40,002 --> 00:20:41,401
Yeah, maybe not to you.

241
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,740
There you go, end of story.

242
00:20:55,316 --> 00:20:56,484
No, no, no.
It's... It's not about...

243
00:20:56,485 --> 00:20:58,151
End of story.

244
00:21:14,235 --> 00:21:15,670
How're you doing?

245
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:18,172
A bunch of us are going to dinner.

246
00:21:18,173 --> 00:21:19,373
Do you wanna come?

247
00:21:21,009 --> 00:21:22,789
Sure.
Well, get in.

248
00:23:39,647 --> 00:23:42,315
Okay, just stop holding onto me.

249
00:23:43,117 --> 00:23:44,552
I lost a lung not a leg.

250
00:23:59,834 --> 00:24:01,959
Rachel, honey, stop over
here, and get me some cigarettes.

251
00:24:01,985 --> 00:24:04,873
- Would you, please?
- Cigarettes? Dad, are you crazy?

252
00:24:05,274 --> 00:24:06,706
Please.

253
00:24:18,252 --> 00:24:19,520
Hey, Pop?
Yeah.

254
00:24:19,521 --> 00:24:21,122
Can I ask you something?
Sure!

255
00:24:21,221 --> 00:24:24,826
When I went to your house to get
all the stuff for the hospital,

256
00:24:24,827 --> 00:24:26,761
I found a letter.
Yeah.

257
00:24:26,762 --> 00:24:28,763
Uh, from Mom.

258
00:24:28,764 --> 00:24:31,099
And, you know,
you always told us that

259
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,869
she, she left us and...
That's right.

260
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:37,638
Well, the letter, you
know, it's to the judge

261
00:24:37,639 --> 00:24:40,475
and she's begging,
begging him for custody

262
00:24:40,476 --> 00:24:42,936
because I was so young when you...

263
00:24:43,644 --> 00:24:46,414
"When you" what?
You was too young "when you..."

264
00:24:46,415 --> 00:24:49,750
"When you" what?
When I what?

265
00:24:49,751 --> 00:24:52,553
When I wouldn't let you grow
up in a whorehouse, huh?

266
00:24:52,554 --> 00:24:55,289
Listen, your mother...

267
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,125
Your mother was a bitch!

268
00:24:57,126 --> 00:24:58,793
She was a real bitch.

269
00:24:58,794 --> 00:25:01,362
She beat the shit out of
your brother and sister

270
00:25:01,363 --> 00:25:03,498
on a daily basis with whatever
she had in her hands.

271
00:25:03,499 --> 00:25:08,769
She was a violent drunk, she
was a twisted, fucking slut!

272
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:12,840
And it was because
of your fucking safety...

273
00:25:12,841 --> 00:25:15,610
It was because of your safety
that I kicked her out.

274
00:25:15,611 --> 00:25:17,777
Your safety. Yours.

275
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,983
So you have... You have no memories
of her! You got none!

276
00:25:26,187 --> 00:25:28,887
You have none, and if you did,
you'd throw up. I promise you.

277
00:25:31,425 --> 00:25:32,959
When she died,

278
00:25:34,462 --> 00:25:36,396
it didn't matter to me,

279
00:25:37,665 --> 00:25:39,433
it didn't matter to... to her.

280
00:25:39,434 --> 00:25:41,501
It didn't matter to any of us.

281
00:25:45,339 --> 00:25:50,545
Well, look, just stay
out of the past, son.

282
00:25:50,546 --> 00:25:52,580
Just stay out of
the God damned past

283
00:25:52,581 --> 00:25:55,583
and... and live
your own life now, okay?

284
00:25:55,584 --> 00:25:56,950
Please.

285
00:25:58,753 --> 00:26:00,387
Please, okay?

286
00:26:02,323 --> 00:26:05,659
Okay. Let's go, honey.

287
00:26:30,551 --> 00:26:33,620
Come on, Ven, Ven, Ven,
Ven, Ven. Come on!

288
00:26:56,944 --> 00:26:58,813
Hiya, pumpkin.
How you doin', huh?

289
00:26:58,814 --> 00:27:00,515
Hi, Daddy.
Hey.

290
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:04,552
She has an ear ache.

291
00:27:04,553 --> 00:27:05,720
Oh, has she got a fever?

292
00:27:05,721 --> 00:27:07,861
Yeah, but it's going down.

293
00:27:08,489 --> 00:27:10,691
Hey. How are you?

294
00:27:10,692 --> 00:27:11,992
How are you?
Are you all right?

295
00:27:12,426 --> 00:27:14,562
What's it look like?

296
00:27:14,563 --> 00:27:16,264
How are you?
You need anything?

297
00:27:16,265 --> 00:27:17,605
No.

298
00:27:19,667 --> 00:27:22,035
Wait. Look what I got for you.

299
00:27:23,704 --> 00:27:24,704
You like it?

300
00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:26,760
Yes.

301
00:27:28,876 --> 00:27:30,477
There it is.

302
00:27:36,917 --> 00:27:38,619
What?

303
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,655
Is it true?
What?

304
00:27:40,656 --> 00:27:42,723
That they got nothing?

305
00:27:42,724 --> 00:27:45,425
No. I mean yes, it's true, yeah.

306
00:27:52,066 --> 00:27:53,867
You promised me.

307
00:27:56,504 --> 00:27:58,684
You said this wouldn't happen.

308
00:27:59,573 --> 00:28:01,914
And look where we are now.

309
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,912
Babe, babe.
I can't, Anthony.

310
00:28:04,913 --> 00:28:08,293
I can't do it again, okay?
Babe, babe.

311
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,850
They got nothing, all right?

312
00:28:13,321 --> 00:28:15,423
They ain't got shit.

313
00:28:15,424 --> 00:28:17,991
I'm getting outta
here soon. Trust me.

314
00:28:45,486 --> 00:28:46,787
Fucker!

315
00:28:46,788 --> 00:28:50,358
You get out, you don't even call me?
Jesus, Mike.

316
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:52,560
Where the fuck did you come from?

317
00:28:52,561 --> 00:28:54,962
- Good to see you.
- Hey! Hey!

318
00:28:54,963 --> 00:28:56,830
What're you doin'?

319
00:28:57,798 --> 00:28:59,467
Chitchat?

320
00:28:59,468 --> 00:29:02,536
We're paying you to chitchat? You wanna
chitchat, you go back to prison.

321
00:29:02,537 --> 00:29:05,597
You're paid to work, so get
a fuckin' move on! Okay?

322
00:29:13,381 --> 00:29:15,482
Let's just go back to work, okay?

323
00:29:28,629 --> 00:29:31,049
What the hell is goin' on?

324
00:29:55,055 --> 00:29:56,524
What do you wanna know?

325
00:29:56,525 --> 00:29:57,658
Please, don't be mad.

326
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:01,028
I'm not mad.
I asked you a question.

327
00:30:01,029 --> 00:30:03,596
You wanna know what I did?
Why I went away?

328
00:30:04,598 --> 00:30:06,434
Yeah.

329
00:30:06,435 --> 00:30:08,569
I got 12 years for killing a guy.

330
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:11,230
He raped and killed
a woman I was with.

331
00:30:13,974 --> 00:30:15,976
Listen, I spent most
of my fucking youth

332
00:30:15,977 --> 00:30:18,846
in correction houses and
prisons, that's who I am.

333
00:30:18,847 --> 00:30:20,187
You wanna leave, leave.

334
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:27,588
The few times I've seen my
father, he was behind bars.

335
00:30:27,589 --> 00:30:30,790
But what I hated the most is
that he always lied to me.

336
00:30:33,093 --> 00:30:35,663
I'm not sure I can get past this.

337
00:30:35,664 --> 00:30:37,598
But if you want me to,
you gotta always be honest

338
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:39,899
and you gotta tell me the truth.

339
00:30:43,938 --> 00:30:45,573
Yep!

340
00:30:45,574 --> 00:30:47,354
Hey, Frank, there's a
woman here to see you.

341
00:30:48,175 --> 00:30:49,243
Oh, about what?

342
00:30:49,244 --> 00:30:50,944
She says it's private.

343
00:30:52,613 --> 00:30:55,214
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

344
00:31:03,657 --> 00:31:04,824
Hey.

345
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,564
Look, I'm... Uh, I'm sorry
about the other day.

346
00:31:10,565 --> 00:31:12,066
I don't want any trouble.

347
00:31:12,067 --> 00:31:13,167
Why, am I trouble right now?

348
00:31:13,168 --> 00:31:16,136
Please, Vanessa, I can't
really talk right now, okay?

349
00:31:16,137 --> 00:31:17,872
I'm working, all right?

350
00:31:17,873 --> 00:31:19,840
Oh, so you can come to my work
but I can't come to yours?

351
00:31:19,841 --> 00:31:21,275
Don't touch me.

352
00:31:21,276 --> 00:31:23,511
You want some help, Frank?

353
00:31:23,512 --> 00:31:24,377
No.

354
00:31:27,749 --> 00:31:30,090
You wanna go for a drink?

355
00:31:33,854 --> 00:31:35,655
I'll be outside.

356
00:31:51,238 --> 00:31:52,773
You want something to drink?

357
00:31:52,774 --> 00:31:54,942
No. You locked up the wrong guy.

358
00:31:54,943 --> 00:31:56,010
Vanessa, listen to me.

359
00:31:56,011 --> 00:31:57,144
No, you listen to me.

360
00:31:57,145 --> 00:31:58,946
I wanna know one thing.

361
00:31:58,947 --> 00:32:00,180
Is it because of me
that you locked him up?

362
00:32:00,181 --> 00:32:01,682
Is it because of us?

363
00:32:01,683 --> 00:32:03,184
What are you talkin'...

364
00:32:03,283 --> 00:32:06,954
You know exactly
what I'm talking about!

365
00:32:06,955 --> 00:32:09,557
Do you think I could actually
do that even if I wanted to?

366
00:32:09,558 --> 00:32:11,592
Do you have any idea how much
evidence we got against him?

367
00:32:11,593 --> 00:32:13,192
No. You got nothing.

368
00:32:14,662 --> 00:32:17,097
You don't know Anthony.
He's a good man.

369
00:32:17,098 --> 00:32:19,667
Yes, he was trouble but
that's all in the past, okay?

370
00:32:19,668 --> 00:32:22,169
You have no idea what
this man has done for me,

371
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:24,939
for my mother when she
was sick, for my family!

372
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,840
When he got out,
he promised me that

373
00:32:26,841 --> 00:32:29,677
he was gonna stay clean
for me and for my kid.

374
00:32:29,678 --> 00:32:31,110
I understand.

375
00:32:32,246 --> 00:32:33,746
Some guys,

376
00:32:35,783 --> 00:32:38,363
they don't keep their promises.

377
00:32:39,353 --> 00:32:41,213
You're right, they don't.

378
00:32:51,231 --> 00:32:53,900
Where's the bathroom?
Straight back.

379
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,681
Stop following me!

380
00:33:40,682 --> 00:33:42,315
I'm not following you!

381
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,756
Just stop that!
Don't touch me!

382
00:33:48,757 --> 00:33:49,756
- Just stop... Let me just...
- Don't touch me!

383
00:33:49,757 --> 00:33:51,859
I don't ever wanna
fucking see you again!

384
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,294
You understand that?
You fucking left me...

385
00:33:54,295 --> 00:33:56,062
I... I didn't leave you!
You left me!

386
00:33:56,063 --> 00:33:59,199
I didn't understand myself, I was
stupid, all right? That's all!

387
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,301
Why do you wanna fucking
come back into my life?

388
00:34:01,302 --> 00:34:03,370
You fucking screwed up once,

389
00:34:03,371 --> 00:34:05,906
and now you wanna fucking
take away the one fucking guy

390
00:34:05,907 --> 00:34:07,741
that has been good to me?

391
00:34:07,742 --> 00:34:09,375
I have a kid with him!

392
00:34:11,311 --> 00:34:12,780
You fucking...

393
00:34:12,781 --> 00:34:14,848
You don't fucking understand!

394
00:34:14,849 --> 00:34:16,216
For you, I was like...

395
00:34:16,217 --> 00:34:18,318
Oh yeah, a good fucking deal!

396
00:34:18,319 --> 00:34:21,220
Do you know what it was
like every fucking year?

397
00:34:29,096 --> 00:34:31,264
I fucking hate you.
I hate you.

398
00:34:36,737 --> 00:34:37,804
Hey.

399
00:34:40,874 --> 00:34:42,375
No, no, no!

400
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:47,173
I wanna be with you.

401
00:35:49,042 --> 00:35:51,510
That's what I know,
I wanna be with you.

402
00:35:55,048 --> 00:35:57,016
I wanna be with you.

403
00:35:59,486 --> 00:36:02,088
And I ain't gonna leave you again.

404
00:36:33,587 --> 00:36:35,322
That's Vincent and Partenza.

405
00:36:35,323 --> 00:36:37,391
They're working with Scarfo,

406
00:36:37,392 --> 00:36:39,393
the one your brother put in the joint.
You know them?

407
00:36:39,394 --> 00:36:41,428
I know him. I don't know them.

408
00:36:41,429 --> 00:36:42,930
Guys from Philly.

409
00:36:43,029 --> 00:36:46,834
They started up three, four years
ago, doing girls and scores.

410
00:36:46,835 --> 00:36:49,102
We've become friendly.

411
00:36:49,103 --> 00:36:51,104
They're prepping a job right now,

412
00:36:51,105 --> 00:36:53,607
except they're having trouble
with some guys tipping the cops.

413
00:36:53,608 --> 00:36:55,609
They need someone reliable, Chris.

414
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:57,209
I could introduce you.

415
00:36:57,611 --> 00:36:59,011
No.

416
00:37:01,014 --> 00:37:03,350
Understood.
You change your mind, you let me know.

417
00:37:03,351 --> 00:37:05,352
It's your call.

418
00:37:05,353 --> 00:37:07,321
Whoa, Monica, babe.

419
00:37:07,322 --> 00:37:09,583
You look gorgeous!
Hey!

420
00:37:12,626 --> 00:37:14,628
Old habits die hard.

421
00:37:14,629 --> 00:37:16,063
I was in the neighborhood.

422
00:37:16,064 --> 00:37:17,444
Oh, yeah?

423
00:37:18,332 --> 00:37:19,533
You want a drink?

424
00:37:19,534 --> 00:37:22,234
I'm with clients.
Gotta go.

425
00:37:23,136 --> 00:37:24,570
Take it easy.

426
00:38:17,324 --> 00:38:20,292
You okay?
Well, I'm good.

427
00:38:20,961 --> 00:38:22,763
It belongs to the city.

428
00:38:23,589 --> 00:38:28,334
But it's got potential. Just imagine,
hot dogs, french fries, drinks, huh?

429
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:36,143
I just don't wanna go into
this by myself, Chris.

430
00:38:36,144 --> 00:38:38,245
So what do you say?
You interested?

431
00:38:38,246 --> 00:38:39,680
What, you want us
to go into business together?

432
00:38:39,681 --> 00:38:41,061
Yeah!

433
00:38:42,549 --> 00:38:44,051
I don't got a cent to my name.

434
00:38:44,052 --> 00:38:46,086
We don't need much.
What do we need, huh?

435
00:38:46,087 --> 00:38:48,121
A coat of paint?

436
00:38:48,122 --> 00:38:50,590
Look, the deal is, the park
commissioner has to pick us. Right?

437
00:38:50,591 --> 00:38:54,294
But Martin thinks that anybody
he recommends has a good shot.

438
00:38:54,295 --> 00:38:56,129
Chris, this is something
we could call our own.

439
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:58,265
Mikey, we just been inside.

440
00:38:58,266 --> 00:39:02,102
It's not our best
attribute, I know that.

441
00:39:02,103 --> 00:39:05,339
But the mayor's looking for good
stories on his work release program.

442
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,840
So the redemption angle works.

443
00:39:09,009 --> 00:39:11,310
Come on, give it a look.

444
00:39:12,746 --> 00:39:15,749
I mean, look at this.
It's pretty much built for us.

445
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:20,286
I mean fix this up a little,
throw a nail here.

446
00:39:22,489 --> 00:39:24,458
Paint it.

447
00:39:24,459 --> 00:39:26,760
We change the sign, you
know, "Mike, Chris, Chris."

448
00:39:26,761 --> 00:39:29,763

even have to change it.

He's living with you, isn't he?

477
00:41:35,422 --> 00:41:37,390
I'm not sure that's such
a good idea, Frank.

478
00:41:37,391 --> 00:41:38,525
What, is this
your personal opinion,

479
00:41:38,526 --> 00:41:41,495
or is this coming from higher up?

480
00:41:41,496 --> 00:41:45,832
Well your brother has a very loud
reputation, you know, so people talk.

481
00:41:45,833 --> 00:41:48,769
A man's allowed to help
his family, isn't he?

482
00:41:48,795 --> 00:41:49,503
Frank.

483
00:41:49,504 --> 00:41:52,305
I'm not gonna turn my back on him
just because I'm a cop. You know.

484
00:41:52,306 --> 00:41:54,639
He's trying to get his life in order again...
I'm not asking you to do that.

485
00:41:54,642 --> 00:41:56,910
What are you asking me then?

486
00:41:56,911 --> 00:42:01,348
I'm just asking you
to be careful, that's all.

487
00:42:01,349 --> 00:42:03,610
All right? You just do
what you think is right.

488
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,251
But be careful.

489
00:42:22,702 --> 00:42:24,771
Oh, fuck...

490
00:42:24,772 --> 00:42:26,152
Hey, is this the guy?

491
00:42:27,407 --> 00:42:28,787
All right, lose the hat.

492
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:33,580
Sorry I'm late.
Hey, Mike! How are you?

493
00:42:33,581 --> 00:42:35,748
Mister Herley.
Hey, wow!

494
00:42:37,484 --> 00:42:39,352
Mike you really did it, huh?

495
00:42:39,353 --> 00:42:40,820
Jeez.

496
00:42:40,821 --> 00:42:42,388
Well...

497
00:42:44,324 --> 00:42:47,961
Well, great! Great job!

498
00:42:47,962 --> 00:42:50,931
Now, I know what I said, Mike,

499
00:42:50,932 --> 00:42:55,869
but unfortunately there's nothing
written down, right? So...

500
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:59,406
How... How can you say that?
I mean, just like that?

501
00:42:59,407 --> 00:43:00,408
I'm sorry.

502
00:43:00,507 --> 00:43:04,544
If it was up to me, you'd get it,
I mean, I gave you my full support.

503
00:43:04,545 --> 00:43:06,780
So what's the problem?

504
00:43:06,781 --> 00:43:09,816
Well, the mayor's been getting
these anonymous letters.

505
00:43:09,817 --> 00:43:11,484
You know, and some of
his people have too,

506
00:43:11,485 --> 00:43:13,620
and, you know, they're
not too happy about it.

507
00:43:13,621 --> 00:43:16,923
Wait, wait. You knew about our records,
so did the commissioner, right?

508
00:43:16,924 --> 00:43:19,659
Yeah, right. But, this guy,

509
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,595
you know, he's gonna make a
stink with the whole city.

510
00:43:21,596 --> 00:43:23,263
So, I mean,
what do you want with me?

511
00:43:23,264 --> 00:43:25,498
You said it was as good as done!
Yeah.

512
00:43:25,499 --> 00:43:26,967
That's what you said! Right?
Right! I did.

513
00:43:26,968 --> 00:43:29,402
And, and I said I'm sorry!

514
00:43:29,403 --> 00:43:31,638
And I am very sorry.

515
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:34,374
But, you know, we got
an election comin' up

516
00:43:34,375 --> 00:43:36,009
and, the mayor, he's just...

517
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:37,844
I mean it's just too risky!

518
00:43:37,845 --> 00:43:39,980
Who sent the letters, do you know?

519
00:43:39,981 --> 00:43:42,682
There's no point even telling you.

520
00:43:42,683 --> 00:43:46,519
But if it's any consolation, Mike, that
guy's not gonna get the bid either...

521
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,355
I don't fucking care about that!
Mike.

522
00:43:48,356 --> 00:43:51,691
What I care about is you
keeping your fuckin' word!

523
00:43:51,692 --> 00:43:53,960
You fucking weasel!
Don't touch me.

524
00:43:53,961 --> 00:43:56,930
Do not ever touch me again!

525
00:43:56,931 --> 00:43:58,798
You guys, now you're in real...

526
00:43:58,799 --> 00:44:00,433
Now you're in real trouble!

527
00:44:00,434 --> 00:44:02,369
This is...
Now you're in...

528
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:05,272
You're in such trouble!

529
00:44:05,273 --> 00:44:07,741
Fucking weasel!
Fuck you!

530
00:44:07,742 --> 00:44:09,309
Fuck you!

531
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:11,711
You are fucked!

532
00:44:11,712 --> 00:44:12,946
If I fuckin' had a gun...
Fuck!

533
00:44:12,947 --> 00:44:14,368
- Prick!
- Fuck!

534
00:45:03,797 --> 00:45:05,464
What is this?

535
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:09,067
You're fucking serious?

536
00:45:09,936 --> 00:45:12,439
I don't have a choice.

537
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,260
You're coming after me
with a judge now?

538
00:45:15,742 --> 00:45:17,811
You owe me, Chris.

539
00:45:17,812 --> 00:45:20,879
10 years of child support.
I was in fucking jail!

540
00:45:24,751 --> 00:45:27,020
What do you think
you're gonna get outta me?

541
00:45:27,021 --> 00:45:29,356
I hear you're starting a
business with your friend.

542
00:45:29,357 --> 00:45:31,097
Yeah, well that just
went up in smoke.

543
00:45:33,827 --> 00:45:37,397
I know you inside and out, Chris.

544
00:45:37,398 --> 00:45:39,739
You make promises
and then you break 'em.

545
00:45:41,368 --> 00:45:44,537
I'm telling you, I'm not
gonna let this drop,

546
00:45:44,538 --> 00:45:46,439
because there are a lotta things.

547
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,907
Things even money can't undo.

548
00:45:47,908 --> 00:45:50,543
What do you want from me?
What do you expect me to do?

549
00:45:50,544 --> 00:45:52,545
I don't have anything.

550
00:45:52,546 --> 00:45:54,013
You know, my brother has
to lend me a fucking room.

551
00:45:54,014 --> 00:45:56,234
I'm at the end of my fucking
rope, you know that.

552
00:45:56,983 --> 00:46:00,019
Oh, yeah. Poor thing!

553
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:03,823
Oh, it's been so difficult for you.
Nobody is helping you.

554
00:46:03,824 --> 00:46:05,959
And you wanna change.

555
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:09,662
Yeah, you wanna be a nice guy now.

556
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:12,399
Don't give me that shit, right, you
can't change, you're trash to the core.

557
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,799
You shut your fucking mouth!

558
00:46:15,168 --> 00:46:17,748
Go to your room, honey, okay?

559
00:46:20,173 --> 00:46:24,243
Word is you found
yourself a nice young thing.

560
00:46:24,978 --> 00:46:26,512
Why don't you pimp her?

561
00:46:28,081 --> 00:46:30,048
Huh? You out of practice?

562
00:46:31,851 --> 00:46:34,511
Oh, she too good for that, right?

563
00:46:35,955 --> 00:46:38,792
Me, am I too good for that?

564
00:46:38,793 --> 00:46:40,559
You shut your fuckin' mouth!

565
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:45,832
You wanna know something?

566
00:46:45,833 --> 00:46:48,567
Your new one,
she'll be hooking soon...

567
00:46:53,873 --> 00:46:56,109
See?

568
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:59,446
I know you real well.
Yeah, I know you too.

569
00:46:59,447 --> 00:47:02,649
You just want that money to
sniff it up your fuckin' nose!

570
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:05,584
No one's telling you to go on whoring.
So stop judging me!

571
00:47:22,168 --> 00:47:24,336
Hey, what's the matter?

572
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:28,620
I think it's better
we stop seeing each other.

573
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:34,780
What did I do?
You didn't do anything.

574
00:47:36,082 --> 00:47:37,916
This fuckin' pisses me off.

575
00:47:42,088 --> 00:47:44,924
It pisses me off to have
to do these shitty jobs.

576
00:47:44,925 --> 00:47:49,229
Pisses me off to see you
at that fucking desk.

577
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:52,665
And all this being with you like this,
without money, without anything.

578
00:47:52,666 --> 00:47:55,067
It fuckin' pisses me off.

579
00:47:57,237 --> 00:48:00,058
Can't you see I don't give
a shit about any of this?

580
00:48:01,207 --> 00:48:03,943
I mean do you really think
that I care about money?

581
00:48:03,944 --> 00:48:05,845
Is that how you really see me?

582
00:48:09,182 --> 00:48:12,082
Come on, Chris, I just wanna be
with you, that's all that matters.

583
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:16,523
I don't care
if you bring me stuff.

584
00:48:16,524 --> 00:48:18,825
It's better this way, believe me.

585
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:23,659
Yeah, give me a beer, please.
A Miller.

586
00:48:25,265 --> 00:48:26,698
What'll you have?

587
00:48:41,948 --> 00:48:43,283
<i>So, the situation here is</i>

588
00:48:43,284 --> 00:48:45,318
<i>we've got two crews</i>
<i>that can't get out.</i>

589
00:48:45,319 --> 00:48:47,687
<i>We're trapped here,</i>
<i>that's the way I see it</i>

590
00:48:47,688 --> 00:48:50,323
<i>and we're going to remain</i>
<i>stuck for very long time.</i>

591
00:48:50,324 --> 00:48:51,825
<i>Did you hear what the police said?</i>

592
00:48:51,924 --> 00:48:55,995
<i>We got some unbelievable news. Information
from monitoring the police scanner...</i>

593
00:48:55,996 --> 00:48:57,162
Fuckin' pigs.

594
00:48:58,965 --> 00:49:00,767
Shut his fuckin' mouth!

595
00:49:00,768 --> 00:49:03,428
He thinks we're all fucking idiots.
Shh!

596
00:49:05,071 --> 00:49:08,207
They wanted to kill those people,
so they fucking killed 'em.

597
00:49:08,208 --> 00:49:11,644
Yeah, shut the TV off Frank.
I'm watching, Pop.

598
00:49:11,645 --> 00:49:15,315
It's fucking disgusting...
Bunch of fuckin' assholes.
Shut the damn thing off!

599
00:49:15,316 --> 00:49:16,916
You know, nobody's
making you watch.

600
00:49:16,917 --> 00:49:18,585
You can go in
and help with dinner.

601
00:49:18,586 --> 00:49:20,353
Oh, you're supporting the cops?
What a fucking surprise.

602
00:49:20,354 --> 00:49:21,753
Frank.

603
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:30,096
Hey, you don't know what the
fuck you're talking about, okay?

604
00:49:30,097 --> 00:49:33,800
They had bombs inside there, they had
grenades, they came out firing shots.

605
00:49:33,801 --> 00:49:35,868
If the cops fired, that means
they had no other option!

606
00:49:35,869 --> 00:49:36,809
What a fucking joke.

607
00:49:36,835 --> 00:49:38,972
You got no idea what
the SLA is capable of.

608
00:49:38,973 --> 00:49:41,374
Your guys slaughtered them
like fucking animals.

609
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:43,743
I didn't do anything, A!

610
00:49:43,744 --> 00:49:45,979
And B, shut the fuck up, you don't
know what you're talking about!

611
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:48,114
Guys, it's Thanksgiving!
You know what?

612
00:49:48,115 --> 00:49:51,084
Take your turkey and shove
it up your ass. I don't give a fuck.

613
00:49:51,085 --> 00:49:54,521
Don't you fucking tell me I don't know what
I'm talking about. Not ever, you hear me?

614
00:49:54,722 --> 00:49:56,990
I've known all about cops
since I was 12 years old.

615
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,858
As far as I'm concerned, they got
exactly what was coming to them.

616
00:49:58,859 --> 00:50:00,293
What, you think they had a choice?

617
00:50:00,294 --> 00:50:03,096
Yeah. That's right, they had a choice.
So did you.

618
00:50:03,097 --> 00:50:05,732
Don't try to make us think that
you're the victim all of a sudden.

619
00:50:05,733 --> 00:50:06,966
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

620
00:50:06,967 --> 00:50:09,801
Don't put your fucking hands on me!
Please, please!

621
00:50:10,403 --> 00:50:12,705
Please, my God.

622
00:50:12,706 --> 00:50:14,407
What is the matter with you guys?

623
00:50:14,408 --> 00:50:17,410
Chris, are you crazy, come on!

624
00:50:17,411 --> 00:50:21,047
I mean, we're never together. Now we're
all together we gotta act like animals.

625
00:50:21,048 --> 00:50:23,883
Do I gotta beg you guys?
Please, stop making trouble!

626
00:50:23,884 --> 00:50:25,852
What, what are you talking about?
Me making trouble?

627
00:50:25,853 --> 00:50:27,587
I didn't do shit, Pop!
I didn't mean you.

628
00:50:27,588 --> 00:50:31,087
I'll tell you what... There he goes,
he's got a smile now. I tell you what,

629
00:50:31,088 --> 00:50:33,726
I'm out of this nuthouse. If the department
needs me, tell them to call me at home.

630
00:50:33,727 --> 00:50:35,662
No! Nobody's leaving.
I been cooking all morning.

631
00:50:35,663 --> 00:50:37,397
I mean, what're you guys,
10 years old?

632
00:50:37,398 --> 00:50:39,898
Sit down on the couch,
shut your fucking mouths.

633
00:50:39,899 --> 00:50:42,001
No Dad, I've had it!

634
00:50:42,002 --> 00:50:44,982
Please, have some manners for
once in your life, please!

635
00:50:45,304 --> 00:50:47,073
He's got a fucking
smile on his face.

636
00:50:47,074 --> 00:50:48,454
All right, all right.

637
00:50:49,242 --> 00:50:51,583
Okay?
All right.

638
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:03,089
You little fucking prick!

639
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:04,757
Yeah, yeah,
go fuck yourself, convict.

640
00:51:04,758 --> 00:51:07,418
Oh, come on!
Hey, hey, hey!

641
00:51:09,396 --> 00:51:12,330
Dad. Dad, you all right?

642
00:51:15,368 --> 00:51:16,803
Oh, my God.

643
00:51:16,804 --> 00:51:20,239
No, no, I'm okay. I'm okay.
All right.

644
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,300
You're bleeding.

645
00:51:30,783 --> 00:51:32,163
Sit the fuck down.

646
00:51:34,487 --> 00:51:37,856
You two assholes,
sit the fuck down!

647
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,980
Dad, you're all right?

648
00:51:43,362 --> 00:51:45,096
Go fix the turkey.
Okay.

649
00:51:48,367 --> 00:51:49,467
Gimme...

650
00:52:00,012 --> 00:52:02,115
There's three of them.

651
00:52:02,116 --> 00:52:05,451
The two DeStefano brothers
and Heredy...

652
00:52:05,452 --> 00:52:08,855
They got a bar over on
Nassau called Gantry's.

653
00:52:08,856 --> 00:52:12,225
A little neighborhood spot
that's always empty.

654
00:52:12,226 --> 00:52:15,928
They open it up for lunch but
they're always in there real early.

655
00:52:15,929 --> 00:52:17,530
It's ideal.

656
00:52:17,531 --> 00:52:20,031
The address is
on the back of the picture.

657
00:52:21,534 --> 00:52:23,468
I just need to
get back on my feet.

658
00:52:26,072 --> 00:52:28,212
I'm not gonna make a habit of this.
Understood?

659
00:52:28,407 --> 00:52:29,667
Understood.

660
00:52:36,949 --> 00:52:38,329
Any questions?

661
00:52:42,088 --> 00:52:43,428
It's good to have you back.

662
00:54:58,958 --> 00:55:02,995
Listen, Chris, I'm sorry.

663
00:55:02,996 --> 00:55:06,532
Monica is on the street now.

664
00:55:06,533 --> 00:55:09,467
I had to kick her out of here.
She was using.

665
00:55:11,304 --> 00:55:13,238
You know the house rules.

666
00:55:19,645 --> 00:55:21,146
Yo, Chris.

667
00:55:23,015 --> 00:55:24,616
I got something coming.

668
00:55:25,384 --> 00:55:27,118
A helluva job.

669
00:55:29,188 --> 00:55:31,208
You sure you don't
wanna be a part of it?

670
00:55:33,993 --> 00:55:35,360
It's gonna be big!

671
00:56:09,729 --> 00:56:11,429
No, Mike, like this.

672
00:56:12,565 --> 00:56:14,266
Chris...

673
00:56:14,267 --> 00:56:18,571
Chris, Chris.
Chris, I wanna go home.

674
00:56:18,572 --> 00:56:21,140
Chris...
Shut the fuck up and listen to me!

675
00:56:21,141 --> 00:56:23,376
Nothing's gonna happen to us!
Trust me, okay?

676
00:56:23,377 --> 00:56:25,544
Just stay here, and watch.

677
00:56:25,545 --> 00:56:27,580
Someone comes,
you knock three times.

678
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:35,087
All right? You understand?
Three times!

679
00:57:03,416 --> 00:57:08,287
What are you looking for?
You looking for a friend of yours? Huh?

680
00:57:08,288 --> 00:57:11,791
<i>And I was scared, you
know but the funny thing is</i>

681
00:57:11,792 --> 00:57:13,358
<i>I did it for him.</i>

682
00:57:13,759 --> 00:57:15,828
<i>I just wanted to help him.</i>

683
00:57:15,829 --> 00:57:19,209
I didn't want him to keep getting
in more trouble, you know?

684
00:57:20,132 --> 00:57:21,834
I think about it now,
I feel pretty bad,

685
00:57:21,835 --> 00:57:24,335
'cause maybe that was
the start of it.

686
00:57:27,139 --> 00:57:28,519
And I wasn't the end.

687
00:57:33,245 --> 00:57:35,905
I didn't tell nobody
that story before.

688
00:57:38,117 --> 00:57:42,188
I guess I'm kind of
ashamed of that.

689
00:57:42,189 --> 00:57:43,856
And he always held it against me, too.
He never said nothing,

690
00:57:43,857 --> 00:57:47,359
but he always held it
against me, I know he did.

691
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:50,496
He was pissed, I was pissed, too.
I was really pissed.

692
00:57:50,497 --> 00:57:54,567
I can remember the first
time that he was in prison,

693
00:57:54,568 --> 00:57:56,735
and he told me if I was
gonna come to visit him

694
00:57:56,736 --> 00:57:58,537
I had to put on...

695
00:57:58,538 --> 00:58:01,774
I had to put on a lot of sweaters so I'd
look bigger because I was so small.

696
00:58:01,775 --> 00:58:03,609
Did you do it?
Of course I did.

697
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:06,110
I'd have fucking done
anything he told me to.

698
00:58:08,614 --> 00:58:12,154
And I'm standing there, and he's, you
know, he's behind the thing and,

699
00:58:13,385 --> 00:58:15,887
I'm looking at him
and he's clowning around.

700
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:20,070
I can't remember what
we said to each other.

701
00:58:21,527 --> 00:58:24,629
But I felt... I mean
I felt pity for him but...

702
00:58:27,833 --> 00:58:29,467
I was so pissed 'cause

703
00:58:31,237 --> 00:58:33,205
I fucking idolized that guy.

704
00:58:33,206 --> 00:58:35,773
You know,
he was my hero, you know?

705
00:58:38,144 --> 00:58:40,284
I couldn't understand, you know?

706
00:58:42,381 --> 00:58:46,718
I couldn't understand why he left
me on the outside, you know?

707
00:59:38,204 --> 00:59:39,772
Where's Janie?

708
00:59:39,773 --> 00:59:41,407
I didn't bring her.

709
00:59:41,408 --> 00:59:42,507
Why not?

710
00:59:43,876 --> 00:59:45,410
I left her at my mother's.

711
00:59:52,418 --> 00:59:54,679
What the fuck took you
so long to visit me?

712
00:59:59,458 --> 01:00:01,759
Anthony, I'm... I'm leaving you.

713
01:00:06,832 --> 01:00:07,853
Fuck you.

714
01:00:09,001 --> 01:00:13,872
I made my decision.
You lied to me and I...

715
01:00:13,873 --> 01:00:17,614
I don't trust you and I
can't do this anymore.

716
01:00:21,313 --> 01:00:22,948
Fuckin' bitch.

717
01:00:22,949 --> 01:00:25,851
Look at the way you talk to me!

718
01:00:25,852 --> 01:00:29,421
I will not have you fuck it up while I'm
stuck in this shithole, you hear me?

719
01:00:29,422 --> 01:00:31,763
Fuck you! I wasn't the one
that fucked it up!

720
01:00:33,292 --> 01:00:35,828
You don't care about me,

721
01:00:35,829 --> 01:00:39,665
you don't care about how I
fucking feel, how we feel.

722
01:00:39,666 --> 01:00:42,286
Janie needs a father,
she needs a family.

723
01:00:44,303 --> 01:00:46,244
What, you gonna provide that,
back here?

724
01:00:55,715 --> 01:01:00,919
Even if they let you out, it's
gonna start all over again.

725
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:03,289
I know it, I know it.

726
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:06,058
Anthony, I don't
trust you anymore.

727
01:01:06,059 --> 01:01:07,425
No.

728
01:01:15,034 --> 01:01:17,174
Anthony...

729
01:01:20,973 --> 01:01:22,473
Baby, look at me.

730
01:01:24,743 --> 01:01:26,110
I'm sorry.

731
01:01:27,479 --> 01:01:28,859
I'm sorry.

732
01:01:30,617 --> 01:01:33,518
Stop it, stop it,
you're hurting me.

733
01:01:37,556 --> 01:01:39,897
Ow! You...
You're hurting me.

734
01:01:49,568 --> 01:01:50,868
Stop crying.

735
01:01:52,571 --> 01:01:54,439
Fucking bitch!

736
01:01:55,874 --> 01:01:57,743
Listen to me.

737
01:01:57,744 --> 01:01:59,604
Look at me...

738
01:02:01,847 --> 01:02:06,784
Don't ever, ever forget to bring
Janie again, you hear me?

739
01:02:11,457 --> 01:02:12,490
Ever.

740
01:02:42,388 --> 01:02:43,809
I don't want to see you again.

741
01:03:39,812 --> 01:03:41,013
They fired me.

742
01:03:41,014 --> 01:03:42,313
Fuck 'em.

743
01:03:43,048 --> 01:03:44,248
You'll find a better job.

744
01:03:45,651 --> 01:03:46,951
I don't know.

745
01:03:48,887 --> 01:03:51,255
I made a mistake.
I wasn't thinking straight.

746
01:03:52,624 --> 01:03:53,624
I'm sorry.

747
01:03:58,497 --> 01:03:59,317
Where's the box?

748
01:04:00,599 --> 01:04:01,780
Um...

749
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:03,301
Open it.

750
01:04:17,983 --> 01:04:20,043
You like it?

751
01:04:23,689 --> 01:04:25,289
I don't know.

752
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:30,261
It's beautiful.

753
01:04:31,630 --> 01:04:32,930
You wanna get married?

754
01:04:39,505 --> 01:04:41,038
You really hurt me.

755
01:04:42,875 --> 01:04:45,844
And I don't wanna be hurt anymore.

756
01:04:45,845 --> 01:04:47,846
I've had enough troubles
in my life.

757
01:04:47,847 --> 01:04:49,180
All right.

758
01:04:52,718 --> 01:04:55,858
I'm gonna make you so
fucking happy, you'll see.

759
01:05:14,273 --> 01:05:16,708
I'm so sorry we didn't bring
anything, we didn't know.

760
01:05:16,709 --> 01:05:19,645
Oh, I thought she said
she didn't want to but...

761
01:05:19,646 --> 01:05:22,748
Ok, don't even listen to him,
this is so great you're here!

762
01:05:22,749 --> 01:05:24,550
It's the first time Frank's brought
someone home for Christmas,

763
01:05:24,551 --> 01:05:26,618
so, that's a present in itself!

764
01:05:26,619 --> 01:05:28,086
Thank you!

765
01:05:28,087 --> 01:05:29,347
You wanna open it?

766
01:05:32,124 --> 01:05:34,425
Okay, Pop's.

767
01:05:35,694 --> 01:05:37,595
Whoa!

768
01:05:37,663 --> 01:05:39,030
Whoa!

769
01:05:41,266 --> 01:05:43,101
What, this is for me, here?

770
01:05:43,102 --> 01:05:44,603
Yeah.

771
01:05:44,604 --> 01:05:46,424
"Leon," it's me!
Yeah.

772
01:05:46,772 --> 01:05:48,105
Wow!

773
01:05:51,743 --> 01:05:53,244
Frank, Frank.

774
01:06:01,286 --> 01:06:03,120
Jesus.

775
01:06:05,324 --> 01:06:06,858
You get this?

776
01:06:06,859 --> 01:06:08,826
I... Uh, not me!

777
01:06:09,294 --> 01:06:10,315
Me.

778
01:06:11,763 --> 01:06:13,197
Chris, I mean you're nuts.

779
01:06:13,999 --> 01:06:16,635
I got one.

780
01:06:16,636 --> 01:06:18,703
Yeah, but now you can put that one in
your room and watch it in your bed.

781
01:06:19,137 --> 01:06:20,271
Yeah.

782
01:06:23,342 --> 01:06:24,722
Well, it's very special.

783
01:06:28,847 --> 01:06:30,227
Thanks, buddy.

784
01:06:33,919 --> 01:06:35,754
That must've, uh...

785
01:06:35,755 --> 01:06:36,987
Well, thanks!

786
01:06:40,325 --> 01:06:42,093
Oh, that ring is...

787
01:06:43,061 --> 01:06:46,365
Oh, God.
Yeah. Yeah.

788
01:06:46,366 --> 01:06:48,826
He had a good day
at the racetrack, so...

789
01:06:57,976 --> 01:07:00,078
Yeah, are you
cutting the ham, or not?

790
01:07:01,381 --> 01:07:04,249
She really wants her ham!

791
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:07,031
It looks like we could feed
the entire Israeli army here!

792
01:07:11,757 --> 01:07:13,925
Evening, ma'am.

793
01:07:13,926 --> 01:07:17,386
Do you think we could have a
word with Frank for a moment?

794
01:07:18,797 --> 01:07:21,867
Frank. Frank!

795
01:07:21,868 --> 01:07:23,300
Can you come here a minute?

796
01:07:33,045 --> 01:07:35,881
Frank, I mean you know, really...
All right, all right.

797
01:07:35,882 --> 01:07:37,047
It's not cool.

798
01:07:39,785 --> 01:07:41,253
I'm sorry, Frank,

799
01:07:41,254 --> 01:07:43,595
but we got to bring your
brother in for questioning.

800
01:07:43,855 --> 01:07:45,195
We came to pick him up.

801
01:07:46,858 --> 01:07:48,794
What... What'd he do?

802
01:07:48,795 --> 01:07:51,897
Uh, someone hit
a garage last night.

803
01:07:51,898 --> 01:07:53,198
The one your brother worked.

804
01:07:53,865 --> 01:07:55,834
$5,000 was taken.

805
01:07:55,835 --> 01:07:57,369
And those fuckers killed the dog.

806
01:07:57,370 --> 01:07:59,271
No, he was with me last night.

807
01:08:00,872 --> 01:08:02,973
He must have gave them
the information, I...

808
01:08:04,209 --> 01:08:05,176
I'm sorry, Frank.

809
01:08:08,447 --> 01:08:10,348
Listen, hey guys, you know,
it's Christmas Eve.

810
01:08:10,349 --> 01:08:12,184
Let me bring him in tomorrow.

811
01:08:12,185 --> 01:08:14,953
You don't think we don't know
it's Christmas Eve right now?

812
01:08:14,954 --> 01:08:17,414
You don't think we'd rather
be with our kids right now?

813
01:08:17,489 --> 01:08:18,522
Talk to Connellan.

814
01:08:20,192 --> 01:08:22,260
And get out of the way.

815
01:08:22,261 --> 01:08:25,401
And you don't get involved.
Otherwise we'll haul your ass in, too.

816
01:08:27,165 --> 01:08:29,546
And we've gotta
search your place later.

817
01:08:30,168 --> 01:08:31,403
Are you kidding me?

818
01:08:31,404 --> 01:08:33,665
I look like I'm kidding, Frank?

819
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:37,400
You want to frisk me too?
Frank.

820
01:08:38,243 --> 01:08:39,623
I'm only gonna tell you once.

821
01:08:40,445 --> 01:08:42,613
Get out of my way. Now.

822
01:08:43,849 --> 01:08:45,189
Please.

823
01:09:00,398 --> 01:09:03,401
My apologies, folks, really.

824
01:09:03,402 --> 01:09:05,236
We, uh, need to talk to you.

825
01:09:06,972 --> 01:09:08,406
What'd I do?

826
01:09:08,407 --> 01:09:10,242
Yeah, we'll talk about it
at the precinct.

827
01:09:10,243 --> 01:09:12,110
Well, I'll tell you
what you talk about,

828
01:09:12,111 --> 01:09:14,012
talk about getting the fuck
out of my house. Get out!

829
01:09:14,013 --> 01:09:15,313
Pop, leave it.
Don't worry about it.

830
01:09:15,314 --> 01:09:16,515
It's Christmas, you
lowlife prick, get out!

831
01:09:16,516 --> 01:09:17,882
Pop!

832
01:09:19,551 --> 01:09:21,419
Baby, baby.

833
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:22,480
Don't worry.

834
01:09:28,193 --> 01:09:30,773
I gotta get my jacket.
Frankie.

835
01:09:32,464 --> 01:09:34,604
No, he needs to
go talk to 'em, Pop.

836
01:09:36,067 --> 01:09:38,970
What are you lookin' at, asshole?
Get the fuck out, get out!

837
01:09:38,971 --> 01:09:40,170
Right, come on guys!

838
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:50,916
There's nothing I can do.
You can't go with them?

839
01:09:50,917 --> 01:09:52,217
Nothin' I can do.

840
01:09:52,218 --> 01:09:53,417
Nothing you can do.

841
01:09:54,953 --> 01:09:56,693
Okay. I think that's bullshit.

842
01:09:57,989 --> 01:10:00,124
Bullshit.

843
01:10:07,399 --> 01:10:08,739
Hey, how you doing?

844
01:10:10,268 --> 01:10:11,289
You good?

845
01:10:14,573 --> 01:10:16,674
Jeez! What the fuck happened here?

846
01:10:18,877 --> 01:10:20,044
You want a beer?

847
01:10:31,456 --> 01:10:32,836
I want you to leave.

848
01:10:34,059 --> 01:10:35,594
You kicking me out?

849
01:10:35,595 --> 01:10:37,896
I'm kicking you out and the
sooner the fucking better.

850
01:10:37,897 --> 01:10:38,877
How about right now?

851
01:10:45,036 --> 01:10:47,138
You just fucking used me.
Oh, fuck you!

852
01:10:47,139 --> 01:10:49,074
And while your pals were
cleaning out the safe,

853
01:10:49,075 --> 01:10:51,276
you got your stupid cop little brother
to vouch for you, right? Huh?

854
01:10:51,277 --> 01:10:53,445
I'm too fucking stupid for words.

855
01:10:53,446 --> 01:10:55,013
You can fucking say that again.

856
01:10:55,014 --> 01:10:59,918
This whole thing makes me
fucking sick. Right?

857
01:10:59,919 --> 01:11:03,488
Why would you ever change?
Oh, shut the fuck up!

858
01:11:03,489 --> 01:11:07,157
I don't need a lesson from a cop who's
fucking the wife of the guy he put in jail!

859
01:11:07,993 --> 01:11:09,460
Say that to me again?

860
01:11:17,068 --> 01:11:18,729
Get out!

861
01:11:45,196 --> 01:11:47,296
I don't want to...
I don't want to...

862
01:11:48,433 --> 01:11:50,173
I don't want to
ever to see you again.

863
01:11:50,502 --> 01:11:51,668
Well,

864
01:11:53,538 --> 01:11:56,473
you might see me on Friday.

865
01:12:00,979 --> 01:12:03,919
These photos were taken two weeks
ago at Lou Rotella's place.

866
01:12:06,084 --> 01:12:07,519
This is Matthew Bachman,
a safecracker.

867
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,580
He did time with your brother.

868
01:12:10,522 --> 01:12:11,957
We're pretty certain
he was at the garage.

869
01:12:11,958 --> 01:12:14,192
One of the mechanics
noticed his tattoo.

870
01:12:14,193 --> 01:12:16,227
It's a jail gang's marker.

871
01:12:16,228 --> 01:12:18,368
It's exactly the same
as your brother's.

872
01:12:21,633 --> 01:12:23,368
Then why the fuck
did you release him?

873
01:12:23,369 --> 01:12:25,537
The mechanic got scared.

874
01:12:25,538 --> 01:12:27,272
We found his co-worker last night.

875
01:12:27,273 --> 01:12:30,054
Someone left a bullet in his
head as a Christmas present.

876
01:12:32,610 --> 01:12:34,511
I'm gonna be very honest with you.

877
01:12:36,147 --> 01:12:39,217
I'm not thrilled he's
living at your place.

878
01:12:39,218 --> 01:12:41,218
Hey, look at me.
I'd never cover for him.

879
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:43,188
Not ever.

880
01:12:43,189 --> 01:12:44,455
I know, Frank.

881
01:12:45,991 --> 01:12:47,257
You're a fine officer.

882
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:50,195
But this looks bad, Frank.

883
01:12:50,196 --> 01:12:51,595
It's too gray for us.

884
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:57,234
Either your brother moves out

885
01:12:58,503 --> 01:13:00,523
or I'm gonna ask for your shield.

886
01:13:00,705 --> 01:13:01,872
It's your call.

887
01:13:03,608 --> 01:13:05,677
Son of a bitch.

888
01:13:05,678 --> 01:13:07,111
It's the only solution.

889
01:13:08,213 --> 01:13:12,450
And I'd rather that you hear it from
us than read about it in the paper,

890
01:13:12,451 --> 01:13:15,120
or hear about it out in the hall.

891
01:13:15,121 --> 01:13:17,180
You going along with this?

892
01:13:18,256 --> 01:13:19,857
We made the decision together.

893
01:13:22,627 --> 01:13:23,687
I'm sorry.

894
01:13:30,735 --> 01:13:33,275
Best to you in the New Year.

895
01:13:37,509 --> 01:13:38,542
Sorry.

896
01:13:40,178 --> 01:13:42,380
Lieutenant, I got some news.

897
01:13:42,381 --> 01:13:45,583
There's word about a van, parked
at a Warde's truck drop-off point

898
01:13:45,584 --> 01:13:48,286
at a bank in Flatbush,
since about a week.

899
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:50,555
I've got a dry cleaner across the
street pointing surveillance.

900
01:13:50,556 --> 01:13:53,491
Seems to me that they're prepping
for a score. Maybe a big one.

901
01:13:53,492 --> 01:13:55,360
Alright, let everybody know.
We'll meet up in 10 minutes.

902
01:13:55,361 --> 01:13:56,593
Right.

903
01:13:58,530 --> 01:14:02,300
Frank, I want you in on this one.

904
01:14:02,301 --> 01:14:03,841
Don't go resign on me, all right?

905
01:14:04,569 --> 01:14:05,949
Have I ever let you down?

906
01:14:20,185 --> 01:14:22,845
What makes you so sure
it's gonna happen today?

907
01:14:25,256 --> 01:14:26,523
I just feel it.

908
01:14:28,093 --> 01:14:29,794
You feel it?

909
01:14:29,795 --> 01:14:32,935
We're here 'cause you feel it?

910
01:14:35,433 --> 01:14:37,568
I know it all right.
How's that, you asshole?

911
01:14:38,603 --> 01:14:41,239
Okay, well, we'll see, I mean...

912
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:43,420
The truck's gonna be here
in a minute.

913
01:14:43,808 --> 01:14:45,442
Nothing's moved for hours.

914
01:14:46,744 --> 01:14:48,212
We'll see.

915
01:14:54,552 --> 01:14:57,221
You understand this is
my car and not yours, right?

916
01:14:58,256 --> 01:14:59,996
Yeah.
All right.

917
01:15:02,594 --> 01:15:03,974
That's ours there.

918
01:15:05,296 --> 01:15:07,132
There it is,
that's our truck, right?

919
01:15:07,133 --> 01:15:08,265
Yeah.

920
01:15:12,237 --> 01:15:16,141
Okay, everybody stand by.
Truck's pulling on the set.

921
01:15:16,142 --> 01:15:19,177
If this is going down, it'll
be on the exit so be ready.

922
01:15:19,178 --> 01:15:22,913
But do not move, I repeat, do
not move until my command.

923
01:15:30,488 --> 01:15:33,824
I'm gonna say that again, whatever
happens, nobody moves until my cue.

924
01:15:47,438 --> 01:15:49,458
That's it.
There's nothin' happening.

925
01:15:57,315 --> 01:15:59,735
All units head back
to the station.

926
01:16:00,351 --> 01:16:01,611
Fuck.

927
01:16:02,387 --> 01:16:04,189
Well, that's that.

928
01:16:04,190 --> 01:16:05,570
Nothin' happened.

929
01:16:07,659 --> 01:16:09,059
Hold on.

930
01:16:10,828 --> 01:16:12,396
It's my fucking brother.

931
01:16:13,398 --> 01:16:15,900
We gotta follow the car.
You sure?

932
01:16:15,901 --> 01:16:19,270
Lieutenant? We need to follow the truck.
Something's coming.

933
01:16:19,271 --> 01:16:21,506
<i>Frank, we wasted
enough fucking time, here.</i>

934
01:16:21,507 --> 01:16:23,508
<i>If they were gonna hit it, they woulda
done it while they were loading.</i>

935
01:16:23,509 --> 01:16:25,410
<i>I wanna see you back in my
office in half an hour.</i>

936
01:16:25,411 --> 01:16:27,312
Follow the car.
Frank, you hear what they were...

937
01:16:27,313 --> 01:16:29,280
Follow the fucking car!
All right, all right.

938
01:16:29,281 --> 01:16:31,821
If you're wrong
you're in deep shit!

939
01:16:32,217 --> 01:16:33,517
Fucking red light.

940
01:17:14,692 --> 01:17:16,794
Don't fucking move!
Don't move.

941
01:17:16,795 --> 01:17:18,529
Don't fucking move!

942
01:17:18,530 --> 01:17:19,730
Don't move.

943
01:17:24,369 --> 01:17:27,372
Car 157 to Central,
emergency message.

944
01:17:27,373 --> 01:17:31,809
We got a 10-30 in progress on 33rd
Street between 2nd and 3rd Avenue.

945
01:17:31,810 --> 01:17:35,445
Suspects are armed
and posing as cops.

946
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:47,758
What the fuck is that?
Fuck!

947
01:18:04,876 --> 01:18:06,176
Move.

948
01:18:14,786 --> 01:18:16,186
Holy shit!

949
01:18:17,388 --> 01:18:19,489
Frank, what the fuck, Frank!

950
01:18:23,494 --> 01:18:26,030
Hey, what is this,
you just called for backup?

951
01:18:26,031 --> 01:18:29,067
Frank, they're gonna
be here in a minute.

952
01:18:29,068 --> 01:18:30,467
There's a lot of them!

953
01:18:59,731 --> 01:19:02,066
Let's get it goin'!

954
01:19:02,067 --> 01:19:04,928
What the fuck are you lookin' at?
Look the other way!

955
01:19:07,638 --> 01:19:08,939
Hurry up!

956
01:19:11,976 --> 01:19:13,477
Go!

957
01:19:35,633 --> 01:19:38,293
Police! Drop your weapons,
put your hands in the air!

958
01:20:11,437 --> 01:20:12,669
Let's go!

959
01:20:20,111 --> 01:20:21,578
Go, go!

960
01:20:48,072 --> 01:20:50,073
Don't fucking run!

961
01:21:00,218 --> 01:21:01,651
Freeze!

962
01:21:16,167 --> 01:21:17,735
Move over!

963
01:21:17,736 --> 01:21:19,069
Do it!

964
01:21:20,905 --> 01:21:23,541
Don't move! Don't move!

965
01:21:23,542 --> 01:21:25,209
Do not fucking move!

966
01:21:25,210 --> 01:21:27,110
Do not fucking move,
put your hands...

967
01:21:27,879 --> 01:21:29,045
Put the gun down.

968
01:21:29,881 --> 01:21:31,781
Put the fucking gun down!

969
01:21:39,090 --> 01:21:40,290
Chris?

970
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:51,101
Put the gun down.

971
01:22:19,964 --> 01:22:21,832
Mom, I'm going out!

972
01:23:10,615 --> 01:23:11,815
All right.

973
01:23:15,052 --> 01:23:19,323
The three perps that were hit
could not be identified.

974
01:23:19,324 --> 01:23:21,659
So far, there's
no evidence of prints,

975
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:23,960
and ballistics is still pending.

976
01:23:27,064 --> 01:23:29,044
We wanna know what you know.

977
01:23:31,969 --> 01:23:33,804
Hey, we were all there.

978
01:23:33,805 --> 01:23:35,840
Come on, Frank, you said,
"That's my brother."

979
01:23:35,841 --> 01:23:37,101
I heard you say it.

980
01:23:41,212 --> 01:23:42,178
Come on.

981
01:23:46,951 --> 01:23:49,319
I had an instinct.

982
01:23:50,921 --> 01:23:52,355
Obviously, I was wrong.

983
01:23:55,826 --> 01:23:57,060
So, Frank,

984
01:23:59,864 --> 01:24:02,165
is there anything
you're not telling us here?

985
01:24:32,296 --> 01:24:33,263
Frank!

986
01:24:35,232 --> 01:24:36,199
Frank.

987
01:24:40,371 --> 01:24:42,405
You know how much
I respect you as a cop,

988
01:24:43,808 --> 01:24:45,241
and as a man,

989
01:24:47,311 --> 01:24:48,931
don't throw
your life away for him.

990
01:24:51,382 --> 01:24:53,283
This is not for me anymore.

991
01:24:56,220 --> 01:24:58,680
And I don't know if it ever was.

992
01:25:27,318 --> 01:25:28,519
Oh, man!

993
01:25:36,026 --> 01:25:37,406
You, uh...

994
01:25:38,529 --> 01:25:41,097
You see your brother,
you talk to him?

995
01:25:41,966 --> 01:25:43,132
No.

996
01:25:45,436 --> 01:25:47,338
Let me go inside...

997
01:25:47,339 --> 01:25:49,199
Do you need anything?
No.

998
01:25:57,047 --> 01:25:58,427
He, uh...

999
01:25:59,416 --> 01:26:02,186
He told me he tried to call you

1000
01:26:02,187 --> 01:26:04,607
and come to see you
but you didn't want to.

1001
01:26:07,825 --> 01:26:09,125
I got my reasons, Pop.

1002
01:26:13,097 --> 01:26:16,066
He's getting married soon,
and, I mean...

1003
01:26:16,067 --> 01:26:17,334
He's your brother.

1004
01:26:17,335 --> 01:26:19,904
Well, that ain't everything.

1005
01:26:19,905 --> 01:26:22,438
I'll let you two deal with it.

1006
01:26:29,146 --> 01:26:30,613
What's wrong with us?

1007
01:26:32,449 --> 01:26:36,086
What's wrong with us?
What's wrong with you?

1008
01:26:36,087 --> 01:26:38,489
What's wrong with me?
I'm fucking dying,

1009
01:26:38,490 --> 01:26:40,524
that's what's wrong with me.

1010
01:26:40,525 --> 01:26:43,027
I...

1011
01:26:43,028 --> 01:26:46,463
I know that you think
I was always better, I was...

1012
01:26:46,464 --> 01:26:48,098
I favored Chris.

1013
01:26:48,099 --> 01:26:50,868
Hey... you...
No, no, no, listen to me.

1014
01:26:50,869 --> 01:26:52,570
You know, when...
When your mother left,

1015
01:26:52,571 --> 01:26:55,338
you weren't more than
a year and a half.

1016
01:26:59,610 --> 01:27:01,311
I was...

1017
01:27:01,979 --> 01:27:03,359
...very resentful.

1018
01:27:05,349 --> 01:27:07,151
You know, about your mother...

1019
01:27:07,152 --> 01:27:10,153
Every time I looked
at you, I... I saw her.

1020
01:27:13,023 --> 01:27:16,843
And you can't imagine how much...
how much you look like her.

1021
01:27:19,496 --> 01:27:20,663
And she...

1022
01:27:25,035 --> 01:27:26,669
She was beautiful.

1023
01:27:28,038 --> 01:27:33,244
I know this is, you
know just all wrong,

1024
01:27:33,245 --> 01:27:38,215
it's... I mean... it's... It's wrong and
it's a horrible god-awful thing to say

1025
01:27:38,216 --> 01:27:41,250
but it took me time...

1026
01:27:42,987 --> 01:27:45,656
...not... not to think
of you as a burden.

1027
01:27:45,657 --> 01:27:49,560
I mean that doesn't excuse that
I wasn't with you all the time,

1028
01:27:49,561 --> 01:27:52,029
but all that,

1029
01:27:52,030 --> 01:27:54,231
with all of that,

1030
01:27:54,232 --> 01:27:55,466
all of it,

1031
01:27:55,467 --> 01:27:57,100
I just...

1032
01:28:01,338 --> 01:28:03,339
I just want you to know...

1033
01:28:06,076 --> 01:28:08,778
I think that you're
a hell of a good man, Frank.

1034
01:28:13,150 --> 01:28:15,619
And...

1035
01:28:15,620 --> 01:28:17,621
I don't know why this is so hard
for me to say all the time,

1036
01:28:17,622 --> 01:28:19,923
but I guess it was my dad too...

1037
01:28:22,626 --> 01:28:23,694
But I love you, son,

1038
01:28:23,695 --> 01:28:25,930
I... I love you

1039
01:28:25,931 --> 01:28:28,498
and I'm very proud.

1040
01:28:31,068 --> 01:28:33,302
I love you and I'm proud.

1041
01:28:35,706 --> 01:28:37,440
It's all right, Pop.

1042
01:28:38,709 --> 01:28:41,512
I can see it's hard
to be a father.

1043
01:28:41,513 --> 01:28:42,745
Yeah.

1044
01:28:46,183 --> 01:28:47,316
But...

1045
01:28:48,218 --> 01:28:50,053
...not really though.

1046
01:28:52,122 --> 01:28:54,458
Not really.

1047
01:28:54,459 --> 01:28:57,061
Hey, banana-head, what are
you doin' over there?

1048
01:28:57,062 --> 01:28:58,728
Huh? Come on, swings...

1049
01:30:00,758 --> 01:30:03,738
So you can be here this afternoon?

1050
01:30:05,062 --> 01:30:06,262
Yeah, I'll be here.

1051
01:30:07,331 --> 01:30:08,598
Okay, thank you.

1052
01:30:20,577 --> 01:30:22,378
I'm sorry, Frank.

1053
01:30:24,481 --> 01:30:25,815
About what?

1054
01:30:27,518 --> 01:30:28,885
About the fight we had.

1055
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:38,361
You're sorry about
the fight we had?

1056
01:30:42,833 --> 01:30:45,836
"You might see me on Friday"?

1057
01:30:45,837 --> 01:30:48,539
I don't know what
you're talking about,

1058
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:50,640
but I got something to tell you...

1059
01:30:54,244 --> 01:30:56,445
I'm gonna get married in two weeks

1060
01:31:00,284 --> 01:31:02,385
and I really want you to be there.

1061
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:12,562
I know you'll come, Frank.
You got a great heart.

1062
01:31:17,734 --> 01:31:19,635
I know you'll come.

1063
01:32:04,181 --> 01:32:05,615
Congratulations!

1064
01:32:07,651 --> 01:32:10,253
How are you? How are you?
It's good to see you.

1065
01:32:12,422 --> 01:32:14,291
You look gorgeous!

1066
01:32:14,292 --> 01:32:15,491
Of course I do!

1067
01:32:20,197 --> 01:32:21,865
You talked to Frank?

1068
01:32:21,866 --> 01:32:24,434
Yeah, yeah, he's...

1069
01:32:24,435 --> 01:32:26,303
He... he said he'd come.

1070
01:32:26,304 --> 01:32:27,970
He was supposed to come by the house.
I think he's been delayed.

1071
01:32:28,605 --> 01:32:29,805
Delayed?

1072
01:32:31,241 --> 01:32:33,309
Delayed my fucking ass.

1073
01:33:21,592 --> 01:33:24,393
Everybody can I have
your attention, a few words...

1074
01:33:25,562 --> 01:33:28,631
Hey, just give me a minute!

1075
01:33:35,272 --> 01:33:38,040
I was nine years old
when my pop died.

1076
01:33:38,809 --> 01:33:41,311
He was a good man.

1077
01:33:41,312 --> 01:33:43,813
That was the toughest day
of my life.

1078
01:33:45,983 --> 01:33:48,852
I wasn't left
with much, you know, uh,

1079
01:33:48,853 --> 01:33:51,887
a mother who was never home,
or who couldn't care less.

1080
01:33:52,689 --> 01:33:54,690
No brothers, no sisters...

1081
01:33:56,627 --> 01:33:58,395
Nothing.

1082
01:33:58,396 --> 01:34:00,896
That day I became part
of Chris's family.

1083
01:34:01,765 --> 01:34:04,301
I never went hungry.

1084
01:34:04,302 --> 01:34:06,670
Nobody bullied me.

1085
01:34:06,671 --> 01:34:08,839
He became my older brother,

1086
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:12,309
the family I never had.

1087
01:34:12,310 --> 01:34:15,678
I was just... I was just a kid
three houses down...

1088
01:34:16,613 --> 01:34:17,873
And he did that for me.

1089
01:34:21,718 --> 01:34:25,455
I gladly call you my friend, even
more important, you're my brother.

1090
01:34:25,456 --> 01:34:26,637
And I love you.

1091
01:34:28,358 --> 01:34:32,929
So let's raise a glass and wish
these two beautiful people

1092
01:34:32,930 --> 01:34:35,666
a wonderful and prosperous
future together...

1093
01:34:35,667 --> 01:34:37,466
<i>- Salud!</i>
<i>- Salud!</i>

1094
01:34:55,852 --> 01:34:59,622
Oh, look who it is.

1095
01:35:00,557 --> 01:35:02,558
You gotta be kidding me.

1096
01:35:03,093 --> 01:35:04,493
Get in.

1097
01:35:13,370 --> 01:35:15,471
Bye, Bubby!
Bye.

1098
01:35:22,679 --> 01:35:24,514
Nice location.

1099
01:35:24,515 --> 01:35:27,117
How many of these
did you say you had?

1100
01:35:27,118 --> 01:35:30,698
Got two more which should
be finished in a month.

1101
01:35:30,987 --> 01:35:34,024
I pay the rent,
take care of the fines.

1102
01:35:34,025 --> 01:35:35,892
If you're interested,
you take care of the rest.

1103
01:35:35,893 --> 01:35:38,395
You collect the money,

1104
01:35:38,396 --> 01:35:41,031
make sure the girls
are working, not fighting,

1105
01:35:41,032 --> 01:35:43,700
finding new talent...

1106
01:35:43,701 --> 01:35:47,736
As for us, we want nothing to
do with the girls. Understood?

1107
01:35:49,806 --> 01:35:51,541
What's in it for me?

1108
01:35:51,542 --> 01:35:53,075
You gotta name your price.

1109
01:35:53,777 --> 01:35:55,145
Thousand a week.

1110
01:35:55,146 --> 01:35:57,814
You don't sell yourself short.

1111
01:35:57,815 --> 01:36:01,151
Do you know who's gonna
spend that money?

1112
01:36:01,152 --> 01:36:03,819
I'm doing all of this shit
to feed them, remember?

1113
01:36:05,055 --> 01:36:07,624
All right.

1114
01:36:07,625 --> 01:36:11,165
But your girls are gonna have
to make at least 3,000 a week.

1115
01:36:11,395 --> 01:36:12,735
Are you in?

1116
01:36:13,497 --> 01:36:15,865
Yeah. But one condition,

1117
01:36:16,700 --> 01:36:18,101
I ain't hooking no more.

1118
01:36:18,102 --> 01:36:20,403
Long as I get the money,
I don't care.

1119
01:36:35,786 --> 01:36:39,189
Now listen, no fucking drugs.

1120
01:36:39,190 --> 01:36:42,559
I want a clean house. I hear anything
like that going on with them...

1121
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:44,828
Um...

1122
01:36:44,829 --> 01:36:46,596
That's over. I'm clean.

1123
01:36:46,597 --> 01:36:48,457
Yeah?
Yeah.

1124
01:36:50,467 --> 01:36:53,903
Trust me, this is
just the beginning.

1125
01:37:05,081 --> 01:37:06,682
You wanna try it out?

1126
01:37:08,084 --> 01:37:10,153
Come on, Chris...

1127
01:37:10,154 --> 01:37:12,022
Fuck me.

1128
01:37:12,023 --> 01:37:13,403
You're dying to, I know you are.

1129
01:37:14,157 --> 01:37:16,092
I just got married.

1130
01:37:16,093 --> 01:37:17,793
Yeah...

1131
01:37:18,595 --> 01:37:19,995
And?

1132
01:37:21,565 --> 01:37:23,732
It'll be your wedding present.

1133
01:37:29,072 --> 01:37:30,452
Come on...

1134
01:37:39,483 --> 01:37:40,950
Here is one of the rooms.

1135
01:37:42,152 --> 01:37:44,053
Room. Bathroom.

1136
01:37:45,555 --> 01:37:46,956
Another room.

1137
01:37:48,258 --> 01:37:50,126
And another room!

1138
01:37:50,127 --> 01:37:51,293
Come!

1139
01:37:52,929 --> 01:37:55,798
And when you're done,
you put your take in here.

1140
01:37:57,234 --> 01:38:00,135
And no drugs in the house.
We stay clean, am I clear?

1141
01:39:03,066 --> 01:39:04,333
You stay here.

1142
01:39:08,572 --> 01:39:09,952
Open up!

1143
01:39:11,708 --> 01:39:14,368
Holy shit!

1144
01:39:14,878 --> 01:39:17,146
Get down here,
you fucking piece of shit!

1145
01:39:20,150 --> 01:39:22,818
I wanna see my daughter,
you hear me?

1146
01:39:25,855 --> 01:39:28,291
You got my wife, my kid...

1147
01:39:28,292 --> 01:39:30,959
Who the fuck do you think I am?

1148
01:39:33,730 --> 01:39:34,697
Vanessa!

1149
01:39:40,704 --> 01:39:43,324
Come on, Frankie boy.

1150
01:39:45,675 --> 01:39:47,677
Is that all you got?
Shut your fucking mouth!

1151
01:39:47,678 --> 01:39:49,279
You fucking coward!

1152
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:50,780
You're fucked,
you know that, right?

1153
01:39:50,781 --> 01:39:52,782
Shut your mouth!

1154
01:39:52,783 --> 01:39:54,163
Watch your head, now...

1155
01:39:55,118 --> 01:39:57,020
You fuck!
Listen.

1156
01:39:57,021 --> 01:39:59,656
We're not gonna be able
to hold him for too long.

1157
01:39:59,657 --> 01:40:01,197
You know that, don't you?

1158
01:40:03,293 --> 01:40:05,761
All right.
Take care of yourself.

1159
01:40:32,055 --> 01:40:34,957
I think maybe we should
leave town for a little while.

1160
01:40:36,993 --> 01:40:39,493
Wait for things to cool down.

1161
01:40:41,231 --> 01:40:43,198
He won't cool down.

1162
01:41:18,702 --> 01:41:20,135
How ya doin'?

1163
01:41:21,771 --> 01:41:23,272
Can I come in?

1164
01:41:38,788 --> 01:41:40,455
You're going on a trip?

1165
01:41:41,925 --> 01:41:43,827
I... We're gonna...

1166
01:41:43,828 --> 01:41:45,995
Go away for a little while
in the morning.

1167
01:41:45,996 --> 01:41:46,863
Where'll you go?

1168
01:41:46,864 --> 01:41:48,798
Bridgeport.

1169
01:41:48,799 --> 01:41:50,365
Oh, Kellner's old place?

1170
01:41:55,438 --> 01:41:59,174
Oh, uh, Pop left a box
of old movies for you.

1171
01:42:01,878 --> 01:42:03,947
Now listen, Frank.

1172
01:42:03,948 --> 01:42:06,883
You didn't come to the wedding.

1173
01:42:06,884 --> 01:42:09,424
I been thinking about it,
and that's all right.

1174
01:42:11,221 --> 01:42:13,155
But Natalie's pregnant.

1175
01:42:16,326 --> 01:42:19,746
And we want you to consider
being godfather to our child.

1176
01:42:22,465 --> 01:42:25,125
It's gonna be the best thing
I've ever done in my life.

1177
01:42:28,938 --> 01:42:31,358
But I gotta tell you,
if you say no,

1178
01:42:32,776 --> 01:42:34,309
I'm gonna be really pissed.

1179
01:42:46,156 --> 01:42:48,424
You look really good.

1180
01:42:48,425 --> 01:42:49,606
Thanks.

1181
01:42:51,227 --> 01:42:55,999
Yeah. It's ironic, you know?

1182
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,401
I'm sittin' here in a ratty
old T-shirt and jeans,

1183
01:42:58,402 --> 01:43:02,205
and you got on you
your fancy suit,

1184
01:43:02,206 --> 01:43:04,507
and probably rolled up
in a nice car.

1185
01:43:04,508 --> 01:43:08,289
If you're gonna give me a fucking
lecture, you can forget about it.

1186
01:43:26,462 --> 01:43:29,031
See, I can't ever trust you again.

1187
01:43:41,177 --> 01:43:43,345
Which is why I'm gonna do it.

1188
01:43:46,049 --> 01:43:47,629
I'll be the godfather to your kid.

1189
01:44:04,367 --> 01:44:06,827
Yeah, he's been out
a couple days...

1190
01:44:16,179 --> 01:44:17,559
Look who we got here!

1191
01:44:19,015 --> 01:44:21,618
It's been a while.
How you doin'?

1192
01:44:21,619 --> 01:44:23,051
Good night.

1193
01:44:23,586 --> 01:44:25,622
What's up, man?

1194
01:44:25,623 --> 01:44:27,997
I heard about your
little score, nice job!

1195
01:44:28,023 --> 01:44:30,392
Thanks.
How's the family?

1196
01:44:33,029 --> 01:44:35,932
Enjoy your night.

1197
01:44:35,933 --> 01:44:37,533
You never know
when shit gets ugly, right?

1198
01:44:37,534 --> 01:44:39,634
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

1199
01:44:41,137 --> 01:44:42,472
Your brother, you know...

1200
01:44:57,020 --> 01:45:00,055
Now you listen to me,
you fuckin' punk.

1201
01:45:01,424 --> 01:45:04,093
You touch a hair
on my brother's head,

1202
01:45:04,094 --> 01:45:05,628
and I will fucking kill you.

1203
01:45:05,629 --> 01:45:07,562
You understand?

1204
01:45:37,527 --> 01:45:38,628
Have you got any tape?

1205
01:45:38,629 --> 01:45:40,029
Jesus, what do you wanna do?

1206
01:45:40,030 --> 01:45:42,065
I need him to disappear
for a few days.

1207
01:45:42,066 --> 01:45:44,467
Don't you think he'll be more than a
little pissed off when you let him go?

1208
01:45:44,468 --> 01:45:45,969
Then he'll really go
after your brother.

1209
01:45:45,970 --> 01:45:48,705
My brother's leaving
the city tomorrow.

1210
01:45:48,706 --> 01:45:51,040
We need to keep him
here until Friday.

1211
01:45:51,041 --> 01:45:53,242
Chris, he's gonna come after you.
Let's fucking do him now.

1212
01:45:53,243 --> 01:45:55,143
Let me handle this.

1213
01:45:55,578 --> 01:45:57,079
Help me tie him up.

1214
01:46:04,454 --> 01:46:05,434
Chris!

1215
01:46:16,499 --> 01:46:18,133
Yeah...

1216
01:46:26,242 --> 01:46:28,077
What the fuck are you doing here?

1217
01:46:28,078 --> 01:46:29,645
You think I belong to you?

1218
01:46:29,646 --> 01:46:31,681
I don't belong to you, I belong to me.
Get the fuck inside!

1219
01:46:31,682 --> 01:46:33,415
I belong to me.

1220
01:46:36,319 --> 01:46:38,521
What the fuck did I tell you?

1221
01:46:38,522 --> 01:46:41,657
You told your friends I was giving
free ones? You think I'm yours?

1222
01:46:41,658 --> 01:46:45,660
Look what this fucker did to me.
I told you I ain't hooking no more!

1223
01:46:48,064 --> 01:46:50,166
I did everything you asked me,

1224
01:46:50,167 --> 01:46:51,801
I stopped using,
I collect your fucking money!

1225
01:46:51,802 --> 01:46:53,669
What did I fucking tell you?

1226
01:46:53,670 --> 01:46:55,371
I said you don't come
and talk to me ever!

1227
01:46:55,372 --> 01:46:57,607
What the fuck is going
through your mind?

1228
01:46:57,608 --> 01:46:59,709
They got cops all over the place!

1229
01:46:59,710 --> 01:47:01,143
Are you fuckin' stupid?

1230
01:47:27,503 --> 01:47:28,838
Say, baby!

1231
01:47:28,839 --> 01:47:30,807
What you doin' walkin'
by yourself tonight?

1232
01:47:30,808 --> 01:47:32,575
You wanna go party
with us tonight?

1233
01:47:32,576 --> 01:47:33,842
It's cool!

1234
01:48:31,334 --> 01:48:35,237
No, no, baby...
Here you pay after you fuck...

1235
01:48:37,540 --> 01:48:40,375
Sorry, honey.
You're already fucked.

1236
01:48:43,513 --> 01:48:45,181
All right. Let's go.

1237
01:48:45,182 --> 01:48:47,349
Hey! Hey! Shit,
I don't know her!

1238
01:48:50,586 --> 01:48:51,886
Don't touch me, pigs!

1239
01:48:52,922 --> 01:48:54,302
All right. Let's go.

1240
01:48:56,692 --> 01:48:57,952
Let's go!

1241
01:48:59,595 --> 01:49:01,429
Get off!

1242
01:49:02,832 --> 01:49:04,467
Don't touch me!

1243
01:49:04,468 --> 01:49:06,268
Come on! Shut up!

1244
01:49:12,441 --> 01:49:14,309
You think you're smart?

1245
01:49:16,312 --> 01:49:17,479
Right?

1246
01:49:20,316 --> 01:49:22,384
I don't think anything.

1247
01:49:24,854 --> 01:49:26,388
Yeah?

1248
01:49:28,457 --> 01:49:30,558
Well, you're not as smart
as you think you are.

1249
01:49:33,429 --> 01:49:35,530
What do you think is
gonna happen to you?

1250
01:49:38,834 --> 01:49:40,236
I don't know.

1251
01:49:40,237 --> 01:49:41,736
Same as always,

1252
01:49:42,738 --> 01:49:44,874
I don't give a fuck anymore.

1253
01:49:44,875 --> 01:49:47,475
Yeah, see, this isn't the
same as always, sweetheart.

1254
01:49:49,579 --> 01:49:51,946
That little Italian girl,
she told us everything.

1255
01:49:53,783 --> 01:49:55,317
Everything.

1256
01:49:57,453 --> 01:49:59,222
Now, if you really are
queen of that hive,

1257
01:49:59,223 --> 01:50:01,389
well, then, you deserve
what's coming your way.

1258
01:50:02,892 --> 01:50:05,360
But if you're just
a working stiff, well,

1259
01:50:06,896 --> 01:50:08,716
that's kind of a waste,
don't you think?

1260
01:50:15,972 --> 01:50:17,472
All right.

1261
01:50:21,477 --> 01:50:24,247
We're going to put you
back inside.

1262
01:50:24,248 --> 01:50:26,908
Why don't you think it over for
a little and get back to us?

1263
01:50:29,752 --> 01:50:31,920
Oh there is one more thing,
Miss D'Amato.

1264
01:50:33,489 --> 01:50:36,391
You are aware that
the Italian girl is a minor?

1265
01:50:41,897 --> 01:50:43,865
You didn't know that?

1266
01:50:45,501 --> 01:50:47,135
Well, think about that.

1267
01:50:48,571 --> 01:50:51,740
Possession of narcotics,
underage girls,

1268
01:50:53,709 --> 01:50:57,946
it'd be a long, long time
inside for you,

1269
01:50:59,015 --> 01:51:00,582
no question.

1270
01:51:48,465 --> 01:51:49,631
Yeah.

1271
01:51:52,668 --> 01:51:54,202
That's all.

1272
01:51:57,373 --> 01:51:58,740
Have a seat.

1273
01:52:10,453 --> 01:52:13,113
Police, open up!

1274
01:52:15,958 --> 01:52:18,627
Hey, sport, police, mind if we come in?
No.

1275
01:52:18,628 --> 01:52:20,096
Is this your mother's room?

1276
01:52:20,097 --> 01:52:21,864
Yeah.

1277
01:52:21,865 --> 01:52:24,367
Go back to sleep, kid, we'll
shut the door when we're done.

1278
01:52:24,368 --> 01:52:26,295
It'd be better if you'd shut up!

1279
01:52:26,321 --> 01:52:28,704
Well, this kid's got balls!

1280
01:52:28,705 --> 01:52:30,646
Don't worry we'll be quick.

1281
01:52:35,578 --> 01:52:36,644
See?

1282
01:52:46,148 --> 01:52:47,188
Yeah.

1283
01:52:47,189 --> 01:52:50,558
Frank, it's me. Sorry
I'm calling you so late.

1284
01:52:50,659 --> 01:52:52,027
I know how you...

1285
01:52:52,028 --> 01:52:53,996
What, you woke me up to apologize?

1286
01:52:53,997 --> 01:52:56,097
No, no. I, uh...

1287
01:52:57,533 --> 01:52:59,502
It's about your brother.

1288
01:52:59,503 --> 01:53:01,803
You... you were right,
he was, there. You...

1289
01:53:03,005 --> 01:53:04,739
You... you put a bullet into him.

1290
01:53:08,110 --> 01:53:09,878
<i>You still there?</i>

1291
01:53:12,014 --> 01:53:13,181
Yeah.

1292
01:53:16,685 --> 01:53:18,621
You know,

1293
01:53:18,622 --> 01:53:20,689
I don't have to tell you, you
know, me telling you this is...

1294
01:53:20,690 --> 01:53:21,956
<i>When?</i>

1295
01:53:24,193 --> 01:53:26,293
Uh, first thing in the morning.

1296
01:54:18,747 --> 01:54:19,914
Hello?

1297
01:54:23,719 --> 01:54:24,886
Hello?

1298
01:54:27,189 --> 01:54:28,156
<i>Hello?</i>

1299
01:55:05,561 --> 01:55:08,130
Was that the phone?

1300
01:55:08,131 --> 01:55:10,832
Yeah. It was nobody,
honey, wrong number.

1301
01:55:12,768 --> 01:55:14,235
Go back to sleep.

1302
01:55:43,866 --> 01:55:45,299
Police!

1303
01:55:48,904 --> 01:55:50,205
Chris!

1304
01:55:50,206 --> 01:55:53,007
Police! Police!
Don't fucking move!

1305
01:56:58,807 --> 01:57:02,111
I just called your place, somebody
picked up but didn't say nothing.

1306
01:57:02,112 --> 01:57:04,312
It's the cops.
They're after me.

1307
01:57:14,056 --> 01:57:15,823
Chris, Louis is dead.

1308
01:57:16,392 --> 01:57:17,660
What?

1309
01:57:17,661 --> 01:57:19,795
They found his body in the cellar.

1310
01:57:19,796 --> 01:57:22,097
Bobby just called me.

1311
01:57:22,098 --> 01:57:24,479
We don't know where Scarfo is.

1312
01:57:33,910 --> 01:57:36,444
Look, I want you to give
this to Natalie. All of it.

1313
01:57:37,379 --> 01:57:39,281
What about your brother?

1314
01:57:39,282 --> 01:57:41,742
Scarfo's all over him,
he wants him bad.

1315
01:57:41,750 --> 01:57:43,184
I know.

1316
01:58:19,421 --> 01:58:21,890
They left!
What?

1317
01:58:21,891 --> 01:58:24,511
They left, they gave me
the keys for the plants.

1318
01:58:25,227 --> 01:58:27,396
What's up?
Is he in trouble?

1319
01:58:27,397 --> 01:58:29,778
His brother was here about half
hour ago, lookin' for them.

1320
01:58:30,466 --> 01:58:32,034
Did you tell him where
they were going?

1321
01:58:32,035 --> 01:58:34,202
Yeah. Grand Central. Why?

1322
02:01:15,964 --> 02:01:17,064
He's running!

1323
02:01:45,045 --> 02:01:48,595
