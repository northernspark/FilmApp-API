50
00:07:48,613 --> 00:07:52,022
Say's subway strike, but I have not read ..

51
00:07:52,116 --> 00:07:53,442
No news in newspapers.

52
00:07:53,577 --> 00:07:55,441
All buses were on laundry ..

53
00:07:55,535 --> 00:07:58,280
and bet that yesterday was not found any taxi.

54
00:07:58,417 --> 00:08:01,085
I wanted so much to be
at the ceremony.

55
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,995
- Shut up, Shirley.
- Then my father talking.

56
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,413
- I have nothing to say.
- Frank, do not do this.

57
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:09,293
- I want to talk.
- About what?

58
00:08:09,511 --> 00:08:13,453
Do not start insulting.
I want a quiet lunch.

59
00:08:14,601 --> 00:08:17,050
My daughter's a fucking cop.

60
00:08:48,056 --> 00:08:50,538
They Turner, how is it?
Do you like action?

61
00:08:50,767 --> 00:08:54,260
- Why what?
- How did you become a cop?

62
00:08:54,479 --> 00:08:57,181
- I wanted since childhood.
- Yeah, me too.

63
00:08:57,483 --> 00:09:00,099
I looked at the guys dressed in blue
and I thought:

64
00:09:00,236 --> 00:09:02,684
'.. Nobody messes with a cop.' '

65
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:07,222
- Since you were a kid, right?
- I wanted to draw in people!

66
00:09:07,827 --> 00:09:09,278
Kidding?

67
00:09:15,294 --> 00:09:17,036
Bravo, Turner, bravo.

68
00:09:21,216 --> 00:09:23,335
I can not help myself!

69
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:43,608
Hi, two coffees and one of them
.

70
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,529
- Look, lady, goodbye.
- Thanks.

71
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:40,797
All the lying, not moving.
You open Cash and give me money.

72
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:44,469
So you want to carp

00:10:44,605 --> 00:10:46,929
One dollar and fifty-seven, agent.

00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:49,473
Oh, God!

75
00:11:52,265 --> 00:11:54,716
You think I'm an idiot, huh?

76
00:11:54,976 --> 00:11:58,668
I saw!
'll Kill you if you do what I tell you, motherfucker!

77
00:11:59,774 --> 00:12:02,099

Quick! Quick!

00:13:01,968 --> 00:13:04,794
Think I'm a fool,
and do not see, huh?

90
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,746
Stay here, you understand?
I play with life ..

91
00:13:07,851 --> 00:13:11,593
in this place!
are not willing to risk for you!

92
00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:15,307
If you do not sit down, I'll kill
like dogs!

93
00:13:15,735 --> 00:13:19,187
Give me the bag! You want to put a bullet in capu`ala
stupid?

94
00:13:19,572 --> 00:13:22,775
Police! Do not move!
Put the gun down!

95
00:13:23,284 --> 00:13:25,277
Get the interval, love!

96
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:28,657
Drop the gun!

97
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:34,651
Look, I came here
I fuck with you, you understand?

98
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:37,665
I told you to put the gun down now!

99
00:13:37,968 --> 00:13:39,333
Yeah, fuck you!

100
00:14:43,207 --> 00:14:49,038
Oh! God! God!
Turner, what the hell! Lord!

101
00:15:06,486 --> 00:15:09,437
- Good evening, sir. Hello.
- Three to two for the Mets.

102
00:16:27,995 --> 00:16:31,770
To recap:
bullets are your guy.

103
00:16:31,914 --> 00:16:35,119
You say that this man had a gun
but no weapons were found ..

104
00:16:35,254 --> 00:16:37,788
At the crime scene.
Even the cashier says ..

105
00:16:37,881 --> 00:16:41,508
suspect had a gun,
but not sure it was a gun.

106
00:16:41,508 --> 00:16:45,045
Witnesses confirmed that a knife could be.

107
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:47,924
Chief, I would like to add one thing:
cashier was shocked.

108
00:16:48,017 --> 00:16:50,582
Yes, this is not discussed.
But the fact remains ..

109
00:16:50,727 --> 00:16:53,764
.. As you empty the charger ,.
And IAI head off ..

110
00:16:53,857 --> 00:16:56,683
For one who, believing he had a gun
.

111
00:16:57,569 --> 00:16:59,970
I think in that situation, you reacted
..

112
00:17:00,073 --> 00:17:01,647
In a little exaggerated.

113
00:17:04,702 --> 00:17:08,071
'll Give you another mission,
Turner.Poti agent to leave ..

114
00:17:08,165 --> 00:17:09,909
to sharpen pencils for a while.

115
00:17:10,002 --> 00:17:11,952
- Stanley, look....
- Please, Nick.

116
00:17:12,087 --> 00:17:15,246
... A moment, you will like it!
Look, there is one of Hackensack,

117
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:19,000
Saturday night .. a bitch
sit in the front seat beside the taxi driver ..

118
00:17:19,093 --> 00:17:22,380
head between his thighs.
Fantastic! taxistul take a dump ..

119
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:24,506
.. It raises its head and says, what happens?

120
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:26,383
Has "cock" his mouth.

121
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:29,639
Man loses blood, but does not want to go anywhere
..

122
00:17:29,734 --> 00:17:31,724
even the hospital because it cunoscut.Ok?

123
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:34,936
Cabbie's all upset because the car is full of blood.

124
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,856
Whore out a needle and thread:
and you know what?

125
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:41,274
Stanley, I've sewn "rooster"
opposite!

126
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,614
What the hell to say wife?

127
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:48,326
Agent Turner in service twenty-four hours ..

128
00:17:48,462 --> 00:17:50,912
.. You head off a poor

129
00:17:51,006 --> 00:17:52,705
And 24 hours later,
is already out of service.

130
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,051
It happened in justified circumstances.

131
00:17:55,051 --> 00:17:57,536
- What are you threatening?
- It looks like a Magnum 44.

132
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,629
- You tried to disarm him?
- It was two meters.

133
00:17:59,848 --> 00:18:02,415
Then how can you say that was a Magnum 44
?

134
00:18:02,604 --> 00:18:04,385
Because they are convinced.

135
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:05,636
I saw.

136
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,181
- Pot?
- Yes.

137
00:18:08,735 --> 00:18:11,216
Have found no weapons at the scene,
Agent Turner ..

138
00:18:11,362 --> 00:18:13,102
and nothing in the body of the victim.

139
00:18:13,238 --> 00:18:16,900
Know. But I've seen.
It was, I saw him.

140
00:18:18,413 --> 00:18:21,031
- I saw the reflection of metal!
- And then you shot?

141
00:18:21,165 --> 00:18:23,449
- No. Then I pulled the shot!
- He shot him first?

142
00:18:23,585 --> 00:18:25,660
I asked him to throw the pistol to the ground ..

143
00:18:25,754 --> 00:18:29,039
but he did so,
targeted it in my direction.

144
00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:31,291
- How fast?
- What?

145
00:18:31,718 --> 00:18:35,337
Here, put that thing away,
I am el.E well?

146
00:18:47,112 --> 00:18:49,894
Hey, it's just a comb, you see?

147
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:57,029
You know, Turner?

148
00:18:57,415 --> 00:19:00,241
You're lucky if you resist 36 hours in service.

149
00:19:00,794 --> 00:19:04,327
- Who says so?
Investigator Nicholas Mann, homicide team.

150
00:19:04,463 --> 00:19:06,664
- We shall see!
- Who says that?

151
00:19:08,092 --> 00:19:10,378
- Sit down, sit down!
- Excuse me.

152
00:19:11,764 --> 00:19:14,299
- Hey, Turner's mother.
- What?

153
00:19:17,313 --> 00:19:20,180
Mama!
What are you doing here?

154
00:19:21,274 --> 00:19:23,184
Nothing, I wanted to see you.

155
00:19:24,819 --> 00:19:28,482
I called, but you were not home.
I wanted to say I'm sorry

156
00:19:28,576 --> 00:19:30,818

00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:36,824
- So that's because if you're working on?
- Yes, mother, you see,

159
00:19:36,917 --> 00:19:39,118

160
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:41,998
have the same job, the same job
.

- Come on, let's go.

162
00:19:47,762 --> 00:19:50,672
Something goes wrong, honey?
You know you want it good.

163
00:19:50,893 --> 00:19:53,289
Something that should not be shown.

164
00:19:54,187 --> 00:19:55,804
Hits you again, Mom?

165
00:19:58,233 --> 00:19:59,015

Enough! Get out, go to another
parte.Haide!

181
00:22:32,241 --> 00:22:33,816
Looking for someone?

182
00:22:35,162 --> 00:22:36,947
None in particular.

183
00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:43,452
- Okay, nu.nimeni.

184
00:22:44,881 --> 00:22:47,247

00:22:55,645 --> 00:22:57,343

00:22:58,231 --> 00:23:01,889

189
00:23:05,737 --> 00:23:07,311

- Yes, since we were girls.

192
00:23:20,923 --> 00:23:22,706
Tracy has little buddy.

193
00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:24,290
- Thanks.

194
00:23:25,886 --> 00:23:28,962
- How do you know?
- I am his accountant.

195
00:23:29,182 --> 00:23:30,966
- Do not believe you!
- Yes!

196
00:23:31,602 --> 00:23:33,760
Not look like an accountant.

197
00:23:36,023 --> 00:23:38,555
Well, an accountant
very helpful.

198
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,226
- Thanks.
- Please.

199
00:23:41,778 --> 00:23:44,063
- And you, what do you do?
- I'm a cop.

200
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:49,402
- Come?
- Indeed!

201
00:23:51,124 --> 00:23:53,604
Jenny, come here.
Do not remove!

202
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,287
- Are you okay? Yes, desigur.De what?
- You look weird.

203
00:23:58,714 --> 00:24:02,544
Like you have eaten something bad.

204
00:24:02,763 --> 00:24:04,169
A police?

205
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:10,218
Have gun?

206
00:24:11,606 --> 00:24:14,056
- Yes.
- But you're not on duty? No.

207
00:24:17,488 --> 00:24:20,439
Can I ask you a question from civilian to civilian
?

208
00:24:21,201 --> 00:24:22,066
Sure!

209
00:24:23,368 --> 00:24:27,311
're A very attractive woman,
beautiful. Indeed.

210
00:24:28,332 --> 00:24:31,869
Why did you
becoming a cop?

211
00:24:34,922 --> 00:24:38,833
Because I like to give people heads
wall.

212
00:24:44,851 --> 00:24:48,678
's Good,
it was very nice talking to you, but now leave.

213
00:24:48,773 --> 00:24:51,097
Do you have more work to do today.

214
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:55,342
- Hello! Oh, wait a minute,
Howard, wait a minute!

215
00:24:55,696 --> 00:24:59,358
- Excuse me, what car do you have?
- Honda Civic. Why?

216
00:24:59,578 --> 00:25:02,402
That silver with broken headlight?

217
00:25:02,663 --> 00:25:06,031
- I'm going to exchange
- The reason I noticed

218
00:25:06,126 --> 00:25:08,867
that the headlamp is broken,
stamp is because the car has expired?

219
00:25:09,002 --> 00:25:12,080
Good thing you reminded me
's because the new car?

220
00:25:12,174 --> 00:25:15,585
And tonight I would have taken?
I do not need a ticket

221
00:25:15,804 --> 00:25:17,336
We have taken many fines?
- Howard!

222
00:25:17,806 --> 00:25:20,548
Howard, relax!

223
00:25:44,671 --> 00:25:46,702
Hey, asshole! Are you blind?

224
00:26:06,487 --> 00:26:08,686
Excuse me, sir,
you need help?

225
00:26:16,203 --> 00:26:18,489
Listen, what do you do?

226
00:26:19,585 --> 00:26:20,326
Ehi!

227
00:26:22,546 --> 00:26:24,455
Ehi, what are you doing?
Oh my God!

228
00:26:25,258 --> 00:26:26,997
Calm down! Please!

229
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:31,044
Stop, please!

230
00:26:31,305 --> 00:26:32,880
Not! No!

231
00:26:34,852 --> 00:26:35,874
Do not tra...

232
00:27:00,463 --> 00:27:03,206
excess of legitimate defense
Turner agent?

233
00:27:03,425 --> 00:27:06,501
I
would advise to take a few days off.

234
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,005
Excuse me, would you tell me
I am suspended?

235
00:27:09,182 --> 00:27:10,883
Until further notice.

236
00:27:18,651 --> 00:27:20,892
One moment.
I'll take that.

237
00:27:28,371 --> 00:27:29,527
Even, and this.

238
00:28:00,323 --> 00:28:01,232
Taxi!

239
00:28:03,702 --> 00:28:06,028
Want to share it with me?
Everything is wet.

240
00:28:06,248 --> 00:28:08,698
- No, thanks.
- But there's no problem!

241
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:11,826
- Grazie.Signorina, it's here!
- I like to walk in the rain.

242
00:28:11,921 --> 00:28:15,496
Remember what happened
one who wanted to remain in the storm?

243
00:28:15,591 --> 00:28:16,038
Higley!

244
00:28:16,298 --> 00:28:19,627
Please here.
No problem, really.

245
00:28:19,763 --> 00:28:22,964
I take pneumonia.
Where do you want to go? please.

246
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,008
- Ln the middle.
- Okay. Perfect.

247
00:28:37,408 --> 00:28:39,858
- Should it rain!
- Really? - Yes.

248
00:28:40,995 --> 00:28:42,236
But we never take.

249
00:28:42,498 --> 00:28:48,033
- Hello? My name is Eugene.
- Megan. Thank you for picking me up.

250
00:28:49,378 --> 00:28:51,945
- Where are you going?
- Between 17 and L8.

251
00:28:52,174 --> 00:28:55,794
- Ok. - It's in your way?
- No.

252
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:58,755
No, like they do every day
!

253
00:28:59,057 --> 00:29:01,592
The nicest thing that happened to me
.

254
00:29:01,935 --> 00:29:03,758
- Cute?
- Yes, yes.

255
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:11,061
I do not like rain,
I prefer winter with snow.

256
00:29:11,448 --> 00:29:13,843
What I like when it snows
, is that the city

257
00:29:13,989 --> 00:29:15,690
becomes very quiet.

258
00:29:16,746 --> 00:29:20,196
Everything seems to stay.
Noise suddenly stops.

259
00:29:24,712 --> 00:29:27,381
And like anything will happen.

260
00:29:27,881 --> 00:29:29,415
And I like snow.

261
00:29:31,762 --> 00:29:33,544
It makes me feel safe.

262
00:29:35,057 --> 00:29:36,161
Safe.

263
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,846
Better not be late.

264
00:29:45,234 --> 00:29:48,561
Well!
want to wait in traffic? Are you hungry?

265
00:29:48,823 --> 00:29:51,191
- It can be done?
- Indeed. Yes, of course.

266
00:29:51,451 --> 00:29:53,108
- Keep the rest. Thanks.
- You sure?

267
00:29:53,286 --> 00:29:56,194
Come on!
Yes, desigur.Sigur.

268
00:30:00,835 --> 00:30:01,700
Thanks.

269
00:30:22,485 --> 00:30:24,477
- Good evening.
- There are two of us.

270
00:30:26,865 --> 00:30:28,689
This way, please.

271
00:30:29,743 --> 00:30:32,694
Maybe we should go elsewhere.

272
00:30:35,332 --> 00:30:39,702
- Hunt does not know what to say!
- Just say no! - Do not want!

273
00:30:41,717 --> 00:30:42,708
Lady!

274
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:47,878
- Thanks.
- Have a seat.

275
00:30:55,315 --> 00:30:56,972
It's very nice here.

276
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:05,939
In short, there in the rain,
cold, wet

277
00:31:06,703 --> 00:31:08,736
reminded me of one my cat

278
00:31:09,707 --> 00:31:11,365
And I could not resist.

279
00:31:13,084 --> 00:31:14,452
For what purpose?

280
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:21,416
For what purpose?
Kidding? No one!

281
00:31:22,887 --> 00:31:26,213
Ok, ok,
stop here.

282
00:31:26,848 --> 00:31:29,415
- Do you like champagne?
- Yes very much!

283
00:31:29,645 --> 00:31:30,593
Ok.

284
00:31:39,824 --> 00:31:41,230
For our meeting!

285
00:31:43,952 --> 00:31:45,568
For our meeting!

286
00:31:53,171 --> 00:31:55,571
Why do not you talk a little?

287
00:31:56,051 --> 00:32:00,710
Unfortunately, there is not much to say,
am trader. Stock

288
00:32:01,725 --> 00:32:04,050
market, contracts, purchase, sell.

289
00:32:04,143 --> 00:32:05,166

290
00:32:06,646 --> 00:32:10,138
A kind of society you for misanthropes, think.

291
00:32:10,483 --> 00:32:13,049
People who buy now and then betting all

292
00:32:13,236 --> 00:32:15,352
rest will go to hell.

293
00:32:17,115 --> 00:32:19,149
I do not want to talk about it.

294
00:32:22,914 --> 00:32:26,281
Know, the first time I laid eyes on you

295
00:32:28,337 --> 00:32:33,208
It's very unusual for me:
stay here with you tonight

296
00:32:36,431 --> 00:32:42,008
Glad you accepted.
I wants to know you better.

297
00:32:42,312 --> 00:32:44,303
I hope you'll allow me.

298
00:33:01,917 --> 00:33:04,482
Thanks for dinner,
was very good.

299
00:33:05,254 --> 00:33:07,870
I hope we meet again.

300
00:33:08,924 --> 00:33:11,042
There's no problem.

301
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,546
- Goodnight, Eugene.
- Goodnight, Megane.

302
00:33:15,849 --> 00:33:20,385
What are you doing tomorrow night?

303
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:41,911
- Yes?
- You Megan Turner? - Yes.

304
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:45,871
We are at the Interior Ministry.
I should follow.

305
00:33:46,717 --> 00:33:50,085
- Can I know why?
- Come with us, please.

306
00:33:50,598 --> 00:33:52,005
Only moment.

307
00:33:53,475 --> 00:33:56,146
Homeless that died last night in the west.

308
00:33:56,271 --> 00:33:59,805
Where
was not too daring, it would be almost silly.

309
00:33:59,942 --> 00:34:02,225
I wish that all crimes be so easy.

310
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,435
Do you have responded to that?

311
00:34:08,034 --> 00:34:09,984
- I have no idea.
- Maybe it coming one.

312
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,861
- Maybe it coming one.
- Think, Megan. Come on!

313
00:34:15,416 --> 00:34:17,699
There are other Megan Turner in New York?

314
00:34:17,793 --> 00:34:20,703
Yes, Megan Turner Augusta,
eighty-six years old,

315
00:34:20,798 --> 00:34:23,249
living in a hospice in the Bronx.
Check, but I'd say

316
00:34:23,343 --> 00:34:25,907
it's a formality. Not the kind of person

317
00:34:26,095 --> 00:34:28,297
which has its name on a bullet.

318
00:34:28,474 --> 00:34:30,956
I do not see myself writing my

319
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,132
name  bullet.

320
00:34:32,227 --> 00:34:34,343
Every day we learn something new.

321
00:34:34,562 --> 00:34:36,680
Where were you at midnight?

322
00:34:37,023 --> 00:34:38,213
Slept.

323
00:34:39,235 --> 00:34:41,479
Agencies have awakened, Nick!

324
00:34:42,654 --> 00:34:43,562
Okay.

325
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:47,067
Right, Megan, beautiful girl you

326
00:34:47,161 --> 00:34:49,361
Can you put someone, then

327
00:34:49,456 --> 00:34:52,282
you had a violent reaction. An old fiance

328
00:34:52,668 --> 00:34:55,869
or else. No!
- I have no fiance?

329
00:34:55,964 --> 00:34:58,873
Got a question!
Ok, so it's an acquaintance.

330
00:34:58,967 --> 00:35:02,542
Look, I do not know anyone, I
my mother, my father, my friend,

331
00:35:02,762 --> 00:35:04,671
Tracy and her husband, John.

332
00:35:04,892 --> 00:35:07,507
- And loved?
- I did not!

333
00:35:08,726 --> 00:35:11,593
No chance to be me.

334
00:35:11,854 --> 00:35:15,057
Yes! Could it be Augusta,
eighty-six, or

335
00:35:15,151 --> 00:35:17,686
or insane predilection for name Megan.

336
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,769
I doubt it.

337
00:35:19,364 --> 00:35:22,357
I think there is someone who likes you.

338
00:35:22,743 --> 00:35:25,944
This man knows and you may not know him.

339
00:35:26,372 --> 00:35:29,950
- But you're our only lead.
- Is suspended, remember?

340
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:31,786
Not anymore!

341
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,455
Nick, I think we need to talk
.

342
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:37,156
Only accept advice from my boss.

343
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:41,255
I want to know, even when he goes
pee. Is that clear?

344
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:44,800
With it, we have more chances
and little risk. Within the limits.

345
00:35:44,936 --> 00:35:47,605
We can do this with a civilian?

346
00:35:49,484 --> 00:35:51,849
Come on, Stan,
give me a hand!

347
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:56,062
- I take full responsibility?
- Completely.

348
00:35:56,198 --> 00:35:59,317
- With your department! Oh my God!
- Nick! It must be

349
00:35:59,411 --> 00:36:01,485
a way out, right?

350
00:36:01,703 --> 00:36:03,153
The way out?

351
00:36:05,251 --> 00:36:07,200
The way out for you?

352
00:36:09,963 --> 00:36:11,038
Oh my God!

353
00:36:12,925 --> 00:36:14,290
Turner! You.

354
00:36:18,848 --> 00:36:22,427
- What is this? - It's a badge
nominal investigator.

355
00:36:22,646 --> 00:36:24,970
You know nothing, absolutely nothing.

356
00:36:25,105 --> 00:36:26,556
The dangerous as they are.

357
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:29,172
- Yes, but risking
I not? That's right!

358
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:31,019
- Thanks.
- Sign here.

359
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:39,998
Lnvestigator Turner.
I like how it sounds.

360
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:43,992
- How do you feel?

361
00:36:44,211 --> 00:36:46,327
As someone who returns from hell.

362
00:36:50,177 --> 00:36:51,197
Watch.

363
00:36:52,011 --> 00:36:53,002
What?

364
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:57,339
At me!

365
00:36:59,643 --> 00:37:01,302
When you!
Okay, what is it?

366
00:37:02,983 --> 00:37:04,172
Why me?

367
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:06,383
Why you?

368
00:37:09,531 --> 00:37:12,275
It's just a stupid question, I'm sorry.

369
00:37:15,371 --> 00:37:18,698
I'm very happy,
I am very happy to be here.

370
00:37:20,544 --> 00:37:25,956
- Thanks. I'm on the highest peak in the world.
You want to go higher?

371
00:38:28,912 --> 00:38:29,905
Watch!

372
00:38:37,841 --> 00:38:41,783
You know, when you're here

373
00:38:43,929 --> 00:38:49,269
and look down
people look like little dots.

374
00:38:50,352 --> 00:38:52,428
There seem to be worth much.

375
00:38:52,606 --> 00:38:57,353
.... We just me in the world.

376
00:39:46,626 --> 00:39:47,994
Want to join?

377
00:39:54,011 --> 00:39:55,198
Soon.

378
00:39:57,931 --> 00:39:59,202
Soon!

379
00:40:02,435 --> 00:40:03,259
Ok.

380
00:40:13,741 --> 00:40:16,567
I want to know if you decided to give him
slippers.

381
00:40:16,703 --> 00:40:19,153
Shit!
What are you doing here my rifle!

382
00:40:21,291 --> 00:40:22,740
How was dinner?

383
00:40:24,753 --> 00:40:26,119
- Hi!
- Good.

384
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:30,789
And mine was wonderful!
Tuna salad without bread!

385
00:40:30,968 --> 00:40:32,584
Never buy?

386
00:40:32,762 --> 00:40:34,546
- Nick, his work...
- Yes, works with Exchange

387
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,253
commercially, I know.
And...?

388
00:40:36,474 --> 00:40:39,594
Nice apartment
nice clothes, nice salary.

389
00:40:39,813 --> 00:40:41,637
Your mother would agree.

390
00:40:42,689 --> 00:40:44,723
If you do not understand Turner

391
00:40:44,944 --> 00:40:47,507
every aspect of your life for myself.

392
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:51,023
Is that clear?
Now you have a secret

393
00:40:52,286 --> 00:40:53,776
Do me a favor.

394
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,893
What should I do?

395
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,489
Expenses.

396
00:42:02,947 --> 00:42:03,856
Hello?

397
00:42:07,786 --> 00:42:08,652
Where?

398
00:42:12,502 --> 00:42:14,198
Give me five minutes.

399
00:42:22,514 --> 00:42:25,296
Sorry! Let me go!

400
00:42:25,932 --> 00:42:28,676
I do not see anything!
Has to do with other crimes?

401
00:42:28,769 --> 00:42:30,175
Come on! Come on! back!

402
00:42:30,311 --> 00:42:32,681
'm Relationships with other victims? Detective!

403
00:42:32,775 --> 00:42:35,684
Can I have a rope,
please? I need a rope.

404
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,562
Guys, it's too crowded.

405
00:42:37,698 --> 00:42:40,607
Try to keep them at bay. Agree?

406
00:42:40,743 --> 00:42:42,191
Megan, come here.

407
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:45,820
Do you know this man?

408
00:42:50,544 --> 00:42:52,703
Well, look! Gunpowder burns

409
00:42:52,797 --> 00:42:54,956
chest.
He was shot goal.

410
00:42:55,258 --> 00:42:57,334
Now examining the scene.

411
00:43:05,394 --> 00:43:08,512
Apparently a scuffle took place
, his briefcase

412
00:43:08,606 --> 00:43:09,765
's up there.
- The body is here.

413
00:43:11,152 --> 00:43:13,353
So this guy went.

414
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:17,106
Killer to come,
he turned and hit him.

415
00:43:17,325 --> 00:43:18,189
Why?

416
00:43:22,871 --> 00:43:25,239
Maybe he likes seeing his face.

417
00:43:25,625 --> 00:43:29,035
- May. You could
to reconstruct?

418
00:43:31,091 --> 00:43:33,083
Just in case the projectile.

419
00:43:33,177 --> 00:43:34,123
Rahat.

420
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:38,629
Go!
Let's clear this place!

421
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,926
- 40!
- 10!

422
00:43:42,729 --> 00:43:43,917
40, I say!

423
00:43:44,813 --> 00:43:47,211
- 30, 90!
- 60 for me!

424
00:43:48,776 --> 00:43:49,934
60 per me!

425
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:51,435
60!

426
00:43:51,654 --> 00:43:53,020
5 today!

427
00:43:55,161 --> 00:43:58,695
Another heinous crime was discovered
tonight, on the outskirts of the city.

428
00:43:58,831 --> 00:44:01,157
The victim, a man of fifty years
, bank clerk

429
00:44:01,251 --> 00:44:03,732
who returns home after a dinner with friends
.

430
00:44:03,837 --> 00:44:06,317
Investigating authorities and homicide team

431
00:44:06,422 --> 00:44:08,747
directly involved in the investigation.

432
00:44:08,841 --> 00:44:11,584
Police chief said that was formed

433
00:44:11,678 --> 00:44:13,837
a special unit to coordinate their actions

434
00:44:13,931 --> 00:44:17,757
although now there are no other
clues leading to the killer.

435
00:44:21,607 --> 00:44:22,428
What?

436
00:44:29,155 --> 00:44:30,022
What?

437
00:44:34,537 --> 00:44:35,809
Who are you?

438
00:44:38,333 --> 00:44:40,117
Why are you talking to me?

439
00:44:45,384 --> 00:44:46,571
You ..

440
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:49,668
You are God, Eugene!

441
00:44:59,901 --> 00:45:00,765
You ..

442
00:45:00,943 --> 00:45:02,517
are unique, Eugene!

443
00:45:06,739 --> 00:45:10,109
Pray for him as your name
make them afraid.

444
00:45:13,582 --> 00:45:17,116
As the son of Justice will appear and new slaves

445
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,911
want protection

446
00:45:22,841 --> 00:45:25,084
under great wings yours.

447
00:45:25,261 --> 00:45:27,086
You are not alone, Eugene!

448
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:35,553
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

449
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:40,851
Stop!

450
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,021
Stop!

451
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:48,737
Stop talking to me!
I can not hear you!

452
00:45:49,667 --> 00:45:51,948
I can not hear you! God!

453
00:46:17,196 --> 00:46:18,688
Want to join me?

454
00:46:23,037 --> 00:46:23,985
Hello.

455
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:22,791
- Nothing?
- No!

456
00:47:23,813 --> 00:47:26,264
For the moment, I have no idea.
Use your right hand.

457
00:47:26,358 --> 00:47:28,754
Wears gloves and leather-soled shoes gate.

458
00:47:28,859 --> 00:47:31,103
Use a very small dagger.

459
00:47:31,196 --> 00:47:32,686
Look further!

460
00:47:33,032 --> 00:47:33,896
Yes

461
00:47:34,157 --> 00:47:37,151
I only six hundred thousand
to watch.

462
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,987
Every minute that passes and you have no idea

463
00:47:40,081 --> 00:47:42,324
Who knows, maybe someone out there

464
00:47:42,418 --> 00:47:43,658
As risking their lives.

465
00:47:43,752 --> 00:47:46,079
Fuck! Give me a moment of peace!

466
00:47:46,756 --> 00:47:49,833
But you think that I do not think about it?
Do not you think, but I am thinking about it

467
00:47:50,009 --> 00:47:53,168
while talking to you at any time from this life
dirty?

468
00:47:54,181 --> 00:47:55,629
What world are you?

469
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:19,894
Come here!

470
00:49:46,306 --> 00:49:48,873
Oh, excuse me!

471
00:49:51,314 --> 00:49:54,433
No, it's not your fault,
not have to apologize.

472
00:49:55,943 --> 00:49:58,478
- It's a thirty-eight, right?
- Now!

473
00:49:58,822 --> 00:49:59,730
Not!

474
00:50:04,203 --> 00:50:06,321
Eugene, I have to get the gun!

475
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:07,947
No, leave it there!

476
00:50:16,051 --> 00:50:17,123
Morning,

477
00:50:18,218 --> 00:50:19,753
your face is there

478
00:50:22,017 --> 00:50:24,090
when I open my eyes,

479
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:29,763
Megan, I think you're the most beautiful woman

480
00:50:29,983 --> 00:50:32,517
I've seen in my life.

481
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:47,063
Get it!

482
00:50:48,882 --> 00:50:52,707
Take the gun, hold it in your hand
!

483
00:50:56,138 --> 00:50:58,257
Want to get the gun?

484
00:51:07,234 --> 00:51:08,390
Strange it

485
00:51:09,818 --> 00:51:11,092
in hands!

486
00:51:17,705 --> 00:51:19,237
What's the point?

487
00:51:29,215 --> 00:51:31,083
Hold it in your hand

488
00:51:33,515 --> 00:51:34,881

489
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:40,844
Look!

490
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:44,308
In so!

491
00:51:50,032 --> 00:51:50,940
Ok!

492
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:02,369
Bum!

493
00:52:08,469 --> 00:52:09,292
What!

494
00:52:10,515 --> 00:52:12,099
I do not understand

495
00:52:12,099 --> 00:52:13,173
I knew

496
00:52:14,894 --> 00:52:18,096
The first time I saw you.

497
00:52:18,313 --> 00:52:19,179
How?

498
00:52:22,027 --> 00:52:24,854
I finally found my light,

499
00:52:27,325 --> 00:52:29,483
I saw the light in you!

500
00:52:30,536 --> 00:52:32,404
Did you see my light?

501
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:35,071
La supermarket.

502
00:52:37,461 --> 00:52:41,153
Eugene, you and me
I met at the supermarket.

503
00:52:45,387 --> 00:52:49,078
You've shot without blinking
,

504
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:51,676
without a little emotion.

505
00:52:51,895 --> 00:52:53,550
I know, I saw you!

506
00:52:54,856 --> 00:52:56,514
You were there?

507
00:52:57,193 --> 00:52:58,516
You only

508
00:52:59,236 --> 00:53:01,687
able to understand

509
00:53:03,406 --> 00:53:04,731
And the gun?

510
00:53:05,452 --> 00:53:07,651
She gave me light!

511
00:53:09,081 --> 00:53:10,237
Oh, God!

512
00:53:10,458 --> 00:53:11,406
Megan,

513
00:53:13,545 --> 00:53:14,652

514
00:53:15,381 --> 00:53:16,745
to see together

515
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,207
this light.

516
00:53:22,387 --> 00:53:24,380
You have the right to remain silent.

517
00:53:24,474 --> 00:53:27,966
Anything you say can be used against you in court
!

518
00:53:29,227 --> 00:53:30,468
Non capisci anchor?

519
00:53:30,564 --> 00:53:33,128
You have the right to an attorney.
If you can not afford

520
00:53:33,233 --> 00:53:35,101
The state will provide a lawyer.

521
00:53:35,237 --> 00:53:38,645
I know you better than you know yourself.

522
00:53:46,873 --> 00:53:49,270
Agent Turner require reinforcements,
1-0-1-3 agent ..

525
00:53:55,717 --> 00:53:57,166

Floor fifteen, ten

528
00:54:03,393 --> 00:54:05,877
And then put me in contact with the investigator
Nick Mann.

529
00:54:06,812 --> 00:54:08,053
Nick Mann!

530
00:54:10,568 --> 00:54:12,016
Do not move!

531
00:54:21,327 --> 00:54:24,530
We are part of the same person, you and me.

532
00:54:24,876 --> 00:54:28,119
If we would know each other better.

533
00:54:29,256 --> 00:54:30,995
And you want while.

534
00:54:33,134 --> 00:54:35,335
Is just beginning between us.

535
00:54:35,595 --> 00:54:37,003
It's just the beginning.

536
00:54:38,684 --> 00:54:40,217
Do not worry!

537
00:54:42,772 --> 00:54:44,805
You look worried,

538
00:54:50,405 --> 00:54:52,310
There is no reason.

539
00:54:53,491 --> 00:54:56,444
We have everything we need to live.

540
00:54:56,663 --> 00:54:58,570
And then, then

541
00:55:00,209 --> 00:55:01,282
death

542
00:55:03,044 --> 00:55:04,869
beginning is interesting

543
00:55:07,674 --> 00:55:09,707
Life  this.

544
00:55:18,561 --> 00:55:20,843
My jacket, my shoes.

545
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:23,390
My jacket, my shoes.

546
00:55:23,694 --> 00:55:25,977
My jacket, my shoes.

547
00:55:26,487 --> 00:55:28,938
My jacket, my shoes.

548
00:55:39,751 --> 00:55:42,871
What are the facts?
What are you working these days?

549
00:55:43,005 --> 00:55:45,288
Man working at the Stock Exchange,
has an impeccable past.

550
00:55:45,424 --> 00:55:47,000
That does not mean that now is not guilty.

551
00:55:47,134 --> 00:55:49,044
That means, my friend,
as may be something out bine.poate

552
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:51,171
More if you put a bait agent,

553
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:53,423
that had even a relationship. This way.

554
00:55:59,482 --> 00:56:01,224
Remove my client handcuffs!

555
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:04,269
Why not listen before
allegations, Mr. Dawson?

556
00:56:07,784 --> 00:56:08,974
Have you finished?

557
00:56:10,371 --> 00:56:12,821
Have you finished? Can I go?

558
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,865
Law, the law, yes
know the law.

559
00:56:16,042 --> 00:56:20,079
Leave me alone?
I already know the way.

560
00:56:22,385 --> 00:56:25,169
I have performed well here

561
00:56:25,263 --> 00:56:27,464
or even not satisfied me.

562
00:56:27,642 --> 00:56:29,088
He's detective?

563
00:56:30,016 --> 00:56:32,217
'm Detective Megan Turner.
I have ordered the arrest.

564
00:56:32,311 --> 00:56:33,336
And what is the evidence?

565
00:56:33,438 --> 00:56:35,303
Knowledge detective in charge of the investigation.

566
00:56:35,522 --> 00:56:36,795
It finds that Detective

567
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:39,810
arranged a meeting with the aim of arresting

568
00:56:39,904 --> 00:56:42,979
my client! It's a trap.
And she's an ordinary race.

569
00:56:43,073 --> 00:56:45,744
I think Hunt is responsible for the recent murders

570
00:56:45,827 --> 00:56:47,819
Just think? and put a person in jail

571
00:56:47,913 --> 00:56:49,529
Because "you think"? It's a joke?

572
00:56:49,623 --> 00:56:50,322
No, I, I know.

573
00:56:50,417 --> 00:56:52,950
Good, good!
Where did you find it?

574
00:56:53,294 --> 00:56:55,327
Knows palm read?

575
00:56:56,423 --> 00:56:59,333
Media will be of great value in this episode
.

576
00:57:00,219 --> 00:57:02,043
- My client confessed?
- No!

577
00:57:02,179 --> 00:57:04,254
Found the murder weapon?

578
00:57:05,267 --> 00:57:07,664
- No! Then you shit!

579
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:11,302
We rely  We are willing to Detective Turner.

580
00:57:11,521 --> 00:57:13,974
And exactly this will happen.

581
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:16,591
Now I want that my client be released immediately!

582
00:57:16,738 --> 00:57:18,062
And if you see someone in that department

583
00:57:18,156 --> 00:57:21,358
only a few meters away from him,
denunciation, the whole department

584
00:57:21,452 --> 00:57:22,472
police in New York.

585
00:57:22,577 --> 00:57:24,610
And, detective, if only trying to talk ..

586
00:57:24,704 --> 00:57:27,656
with my client, a directing traffic to get to the periphery

587
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:29,406
for the rest of your days.

588
00:57:31,129 --> 00:57:32,401
Release it!

589
00:57:48,399 --> 00:57:50,016
Come on, Megan, do not do that!

590
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:52,893
You were with him?
Sefu, it's a personal thing!

591
00:57:53,989 --> 00:57:55,823
Yes, I saw him a few times.

592
00:57:55,823 --> 00:57:59,767
Why did not you tell me this?
Because I thought it was him!

593
00:57:59,912 --> 00:58:03,279
Now you're in good company
because nobody believes it was him!

594
00:58:03,414 --> 00:58:05,322
What makes you so sure?

595
00:58:05,416 --> 00:58:09,080
For saying so! Or, rather,
he not said, but was involved.

596
00:58:09,174 --> 00:58:12,123
He said the first time he saw me
,

597
00:58:12,217 --> 00:58:14,333
when I killed
hot at the supermarket!

598
00:58:14,427 --> 00:58:17,128
He was not there, boss,
among witnesses that damned!

599
00:58:17,221 --> 00:58:19,004
I think it's gone!

600
00:58:19,183 --> 00:58:22,134
Home,
he wanted to see how I held the gun.

601
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:25,055
Sefu, from what I said, I think it's for

602
00:58:25,231 --> 00:58:27,599
how to say, it represents

603
00:58:27,693 --> 00:58:30,895
Divine hope!
Have to follow him!

604
00:58:30,989 --> 00:58:32,937
No, Nick, you do nothing.

605
00:58:33,156 --> 00:58:35,776
And neither do you.
That man knows us!

606
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:37,818
If you approach him
I am going to the bottom.

607
00:58:37,912 --> 00:58:40,583
Whole department goes down.

608
00:58:40,708 --> 00:58:43,659
Even the mayor will reach the bottom!

609
00:58:51,178 --> 00:58:54,954
See, if you were married, you could
to do these things!

610
00:58:55,141 --> 00:58:58,301
Yes, but then you could not depend
you.

611
00:58:59,062 --> 00:59:01,261
Look, boil water!

612
00:59:08,155 --> 00:59:09,647
What is Johnny?

613
00:59:10,868 --> 00:59:13,433
Right now he tears your hair out!

614
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:15,112
He took children out!

615
00:59:15,289 --> 00:59:16,280

Nice! Try to stay too!

617
00:59:19,086 --> 00:59:20,949
No, I meant only

618
00:59:21,587 --> 00:59:24,257
You, children,

619
00:59:24,549 --> 00:59:25,457
Yes!

620
00:59:26,093 --> 00:59:27,115

01:01:31,945 --> 01:01:32,935
Slowly.

649
01:01:33,071 --> 01:01:36,439
- Nick, I want to see him dead!
- Yeah, right now, you need to rest!

650
01:01:36,783 --> 01:01:39,610
Wasting time
must stop him!

651
01:01:39,828 --> 01:01:41,487
Not! You have to go to hospital.

652
01:01:41,621 --> 01:01:44,698
Losing time, believe me!
Must stop him!

653
01:01:44,917 --> 01:01:46,575
- Yeah, sure.
- Now!

654
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:50,664
Okay, let's go!

655
01:02:39,437 --> 01:02:42,224
You look good!

656
01:02:45,070 --> 01:02:46,058
Get up!

657
01:02:47,613 --> 01:02:49,564
Excuse me!
Get up!

658
01:02:53,244 --> 01:02:55,612
Raise your hands up! I see them!

659
01:02:56,123 --> 01:02:57,866
Come back!

660
01:02:58,667 --> 01:02:59,991
You're beautiful.

661
01:03:02,045 --> 01:03:03,454
I like how you did!

662
01:03:06,552 --> 01:03:08,375
Have you thought of me?

663
01:03:08,511 --> 01:03:10,797
When I think of you,
see your future, moving quickly

664
01:03:10,891 --> 01:03:12,132
through my eyes.

665
01:03:12,350 --> 01:03:13,841
And see you dead!

666
01:03:15,981 --> 01:03:19,099
- What the hell is going on here?
- Why did you do that, Megan?

667
01:03:19,692 --> 01:03:21,558
- What?
- That!

668
01:03:28,033 --> 01:03:30,432
's Dead crying Fuck you!

669
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:32,862
's All right, enough!

670
01:03:33,206 --> 01:03:35,241
Can I see the warrant?

671
01:03:36,503 --> 01:03:38,901
What is going on here?
You forced door Login

672
01:03:39,006 --> 01:03:41,486
and ransacked without a warrant is a violation
!

673
01:03:41,633 --> 01:03:43,874
- Detective, is history!
- Detective Turner

674
01:03:43,969 --> 01:03:46,711
e eyewitness in a murder trial!

675
01:03:47,807 --> 01:03:51,750
Well, Detective Turner,
tell me what you saw.

676
01:03:52,522 --> 01:03:55,849
I saw this man, as a slew
,

677
01:03:56,064 --> 01:03:58,633
on my best friend, my eyes
.

678
01:03:58,778 --> 01:04:01,395
Dawson, I'm tired of this story
!

679
01:04:01,696 --> 01:04:04,232
Descend the stairs together with her,

680
01:04:04,995 --> 01:04:08,530
He came after me and put the gun back mia.

681
01:04:08,707 --> 01:04:12,397
While she continued to walk, did not see it.

682
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:16,494
- I tried to warn her!
- Anybody could come back.

683
01:04:16,588 --> 01:04:18,874
How can you say it was me?

684
01:04:19,133 --> 01:04:22,991
Detective, you see the accused face?

685
01:04:24,099 --> 01:04:26,297
I told you that I was attacked from behind!

686
01:04:26,433 --> 01:04:28,341
How can you speak of identification, ha?

687
01:04:28,477 --> 01:04:30,428
Dear God, I know him well
!

688
01:04:30,562 --> 01:04:34,257
But she said she actually did not see his face
!

689
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:45,235
Well?

690
01:04:48,918 --> 01:04:49,784
No.

691
01:04:54,884 --> 01:04:58,084
He will have to resign by the end of the day.

692
01:04:58,262 --> 01:05:01,506
And I think she needs help.

693
01:05:01,767 --> 01:05:04,761
Mr. Dawson, I will personally handle your customer

694
01:05:04,853 --> 01:05:07,471
disappear as quickly as the face of the earth.

695
01:05:20,912 --> 01:05:22,988
Dawson will make us trouble in the Department.

696
01:05:23,165 --> 01:05:25,407
Hoyt people can not give us

697
01:05:25,501 --> 01:05:27,119
should know that.

698
01:05:31,299 --> 01:05:32,875
You believe me, Nick?

699
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:36,296
We have no proof, Megan!

700
01:05:36,847 --> 01:05:40,132
There's nothing substantial.
It is based on feelings,

701
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:41,927
assumption instinct.

702
01:05:42,562 --> 01:05:44,428
But you believe me, Nick?

703
01:05:48,651 --> 01:05:50,144
Yes, I believe you!

704
01:05:57,413 --> 01:06:00,573
Look, why not take a day off tomorrow?

705
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:04,033
You need to relax.

706
01:06:04,128 --> 01:06:06,831
If you have to go somewhere, let me

707
01:06:06,924 --> 01:06:10,698
I will provide a car
Department, yeah?

708
01:06:12,097 --> 01:06:15,131
Not want to put you under observation,
do not worry!

709
01:06:15,392 --> 01:06:18,759
But do not trouble!
I mean, you're a police officer,

710
01:06:18,853 --> 01:06:21,389
you should know how to take care of yourself.

711
01:06:24,026 --> 01:06:26,019
Had two children.

712
01:06:26,738 --> 01:06:27,479
Know.

713
01:06:37,125 --> 01:06:38,866
Sorry, Megan.

714
01:07:16,421 --> 01:07:17,328
Mama!

715
01:07:25,386 --> 01:07:31,342
Mama! Sorry for Tracy!

716
01:07:43,825 --> 01:07:45,151
- Ah! Excuse me!

717
01:07:45,954 --> 01:07:49,279
Would you show me? What's in arm, mother?

718
01:07:49,456 --> 01:07:51,116
- None.
- Mom, please!

719
01:07:51,335 --> 01:07:53,284
Do not say anything, Shirley!

720
01:07:55,088 --> 01:07:57,162
You did this?

721
01:07:57,466 --> 01:07:59,833
He had an accident,
fell down the stairs!

722
01:08:00,011 --> 01:08:03,701
Mother, he knew did this?
Tell me! Please tell me!

723
01:08:03,974 --> 01:08:07,549
- Do not answer, Shirley!
- Shut up, Dad! Shut your mouth!

724
01:08:14,653 --> 01:08:17,019
I'm tired of you!

725
01:08:17,906 --> 01:08:20,105
You hit again asshole!

726
01:08:20,242 --> 01:08:22,232
Not have to say anything!

727
01:08:26,291 --> 01:08:27,906
You're under arrest!

728
01:08:28,125 --> 01:08:31,161
Kidding? My daughter arrest me?

729
01:08:32,798 --> 01:08:35,707
Look, that's enough!
Stop, come on, that's enough! !

730
01:08:36,010 --> 01:08:39,211
Get me out of this car
immediately! Do you understand?

731
01:08:39,305 --> 01:08:41,641
And he handcuffs me that I miss
wrists! Come on!

732
01:08:41,641 --> 01:08:45,219
Finish, I am your father!
Wed ashamed of!

733
01:08:59,538 --> 01:09:02,738
Give me one good reason not to arrest you!

734
01:09:02,914 --> 01:09:05,282
- I can not believe!
- Dad!

735
01:09:08,212 --> 01:09:08,953
Why?

736
01:09:09,758 --> 01:09:10,777
I do not know.

737
01:09:13,468 --> 01:09:14,793
I crazy!

738
01:09:27,944 --> 01:09:29,894
If you try it again

739
01:09:36,370 --> 01:09:37,736
We return.

740
01:09:41,085 --> 01:09:42,907
- I'm back.
- Frank!

741
01:09:43,587 --> 01:09:45,411
Hi, Shirley, do you?

742
01:09:46,464 --> 01:09:48,413
Megan, honey,
your friend is here!

743
01:09:53,347 --> 01:09:55,506
Frank, this is Eugene Hunt.

744
01:09:55,683 --> 01:09:58,386
- This is my husband
Frank Turner. Good.

745
01:10:00,188 --> 01:10:02,098
- Mama!
- What, dear?

746
01:10:04,692 --> 01:10:05,601
None.

747
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:12,610
My mistake. I thought you and I know our

748
01:10:12,829 --> 01:10:14,820
some time.
- No.

749
01:10:16,416 --> 01:10:19,199
Mom, Dad, you can go for a second beyond

750
01:10:19,459 --> 01:10:23,871
The kitchen please?
- Megan have a guest!

751
01:10:28,179 --> 01:10:31,673
I want to exchange two words only with Eugene.

752
01:10:31,934 --> 01:10:34,883
- Only!
- Come Megan we are not children!

753
01:10:35,103 --> 01:10:37,847
There is nothing you can not say
in front of your parents.

754
01:10:39,731 --> 01:10:41,642
- Would you give me your coat?
- No!

755
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:47,942
I'm a little cold so I prefer to stand, thank you.

756
01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:52,737
And I have the same problem,
I not think it necessary to get it out.

757
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:57,035
Police force are still employed to find

758
01:10:57,129 --> 01:10:59,414
any trail that leads to the mysterious killer.

759
01:10:59,549 --> 01:11:01,540
- Did you hear?
For some time!

760
01:11:01,758 --> 01:11:04,793
- Sit down!
Always kill killer

761
01:11:04,971 --> 01:11:07,537
With a Magnum 44 whose owner asked

762
01:11:07,725 --> 01:11:11,301
authorities responsible for the investigation,
veto.

763
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:15,721
- I do not want to watch TV.
- Okay, stop it.

764
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:20,393
Excuse me
I came here to know a little.

765
01:11:22,325 --> 01:11:26,651
Really I wanted so much to come. True!
Talking to you, is we know a bit!

766
01:11:29,499 --> 01:11:32,283
Lord, Mr. and Mrs. Turner, you are really lucky

767
01:11:32,377 --> 01:11:34,244
to have a daughter Megan.

768
01:11:35,632 --> 01:11:39,250
True!
Megan Soaking is the most beautiful thing in the world.

769
01:11:41,262 --> 01:11:43,879
I did some things I do not have time.

770
01:11:44,014 --> 01:11:47,340
I think the time has come to leave.

771
01:11:47,477 --> 01:11:50,303
But I am here to meet your parents
.

772
01:11:50,648 --> 01:11:51,431
Ok.

773
01:11:54,403 --> 01:11:55,674
Yes, I understand.

774
01:12:08,126 --> 01:12:11,326
Eugene, wait a minute,
not go so hurry!

775
01:12:11,463 --> 01:12:12,120
Yes!

776
01:12:13,549 --> 01:12:17,293
- What? Sit, it seems like you're pretty
rushed to leave.

777
01:12:18,012 --> 01:12:20,130
Yes. It's true, I kinda hurry.

778
01:12:22,059 --> 01:12:25,752
Forgive me!
I hope you do not take this as an act of rudeness.

779
01:12:25,898 --> 01:12:28,095
Ah, no.
Sorry to go so fast.

780
01:12:28,232 --> 01:12:29,975
I'm sure we revedrea.

781
01:12:30,068 --> 01:12:31,976
Yes, I hope so.
It was nice to meet you.

782
01:12:32,069 --> 01:12:34,771
- With pleasure. It's nice to know
Megan's friends.

783
01:12:34,865 --> 01:12:36,773
It's a real surprise.

784
01:13:11,824 --> 01:13:13,314
How about a warrant?

785
01:13:13,449 --> 01:13:17,195
Hoyt tries right now.
But the judge's signature required.

786
01:13:17,331 --> 01:13:20,156
- Dawson
bastard will have to listen. Fuck '!

787
01:13:21,333 --> 01:13:24,995
Megan  Where are you? No do not tell me!
Let me guess!

788
01:13:25,423 --> 01:13:28,747
You Eugene's apartment.

789
01:13:31,011 --> 01:13:33,545
Wait to cool the engine.

790
01:13:33,764 --> 01:13:37,007
Remember
have nothing against it.

791
01:13:37,101 --> 01:13:38,426
So be careful, okay?

792
01:13:42,064 --> 01:13:45,185
What is Nick?
Not at all trust in your people?

793
01:13:46,363 --> 01:13:48,604
I trust, I swear to you Megan!

794
01:14:38,881 --> 01:14:40,203
's Look!

795
01:14:50,101 --> 01:14:51,259
Damn!

796
01:15:44,997 --> 01:15:46,489
Looking for something?

797
01:15:51,506 --> 01:15:52,662
All right!

798
01:15:56,344 --> 01:15:57,754
I got one!

799
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:02,966
Come on, Eugene!
Get it!

800
01:16:06,396 --> 01:16:08,879
You never know, maybe I'll be

801
01:16:08,984 --> 01:16:12,602
before you head to your flight.

802
01:16:39,975 --> 01:16:44,178
Megan  Do not do it! It's okay
Nick just wanted my gun.

803
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:45,430
And then?

804
01:16:46,818 --> 01:16:49,603
Then go home to rest.

805
01:16:55,661 --> 01:16:58,987
We have nothing against him, remember!

806
01:17:03,962 --> 01:17:07,372
Gun must be here somewhere.

807
01:17:07,632 --> 01:17:08,623
Will return!

808
01:17:10,302 --> 01:17:12,700
They say it's a good year for coffee.

809
01:17:12,804 --> 01:17:16,130
And you can see that, in
coffee grounds at the bottom of the cup.

810
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:18,760
Tell me, why did you follow?

811
01:17:19,982 --> 01:17:22,263
After you think you can not, right?

812
01:17:22,483 --> 01:17:25,153
- I wanted to see how you impedance.
- Nonsense!

813
01:17:25,778 --> 01:17:28,062
- I do not say!
- Yes, damn it!

814
01:17:37,835 --> 01:17:40,318
You know what I like in town this?

815
01:17:41,046 --> 01:17:43,205
As you can easily lose

816
01:17:43,464 --> 01:17:47,084
As in a glass of water
believing that swim in the ocean.

817
01:17:56,398 --> 01:17:57,471
Oh, God!

818
01:17:59,274 --> 01:18:03,478
You need to calm down Turner,
must be here.

819
01:18:10,663 --> 01:18:12,821
Look, it's beautiful night!

820
01:18:20,466 --> 01:18:22,416
Ok. E
beautiful night!

821
01:18:27,308 --> 01:18:30,384
What pushed you to become a police
?

822
01:18:33,438 --> 01:18:33,970
Him.

823
01:18:39,110 --> 01:18:39,935
Yes.

824
01:18:55,046 --> 01:18:57,580
It's a job that takes time.

825
01:18:57,799 --> 01:19:00,959
- Yes, it's true.
- I bet your wife does not like.

826
01:19:02,178 --> 01:19:03,420
A hatred.

827
01:19:03,766 --> 01:19:05,255
Ah, I'm sorry.

828
01:19:06,935 --> 01:19:07,926
I do not.

829
01:19:16,948 --> 01:19:18,022
Look!

830
01:19:22,037 --> 01:19:23,612
What are you doing?

831
01:19:23,871 --> 01:19:25,905
Megan, come here, Megan!

832
01:19:26,583 --> 01:19:27,447
Shit!

833
01:19:30,209 --> 01:19:32,079
Go to hell!

834
01:19:46,022 --> 01:19:46,929
God!

835
01:19:50,317 --> 01:19:52,642
Where the hell put the keys?

836
01:20:05,252 --> 01:20:06,326
Stop!

837
01:20:08,423 --> 01:20:11,831
He said here
but is bullshit.

838
01:20:13,136 --> 01:20:15,168
Do you smoke, lady?

839
01:20:16,598 --> 01:20:17,505
Fuck!

840
01:20:32,241 --> 01:20:32,939
Watch.

841
01:20:38,831 --> 01:20:40,021
Watch me.

842
01:20:44,923 --> 01:20:46,996
I want to see you!

843
01:20:50,553 --> 01:20:52,587
I want to see how I look.

844
01:20:53,638 --> 01:20:55,881
I want to see your face

845
01:20:56,225 --> 01:20:58,967
respect .. light ..

846
01:21:00,982 --> 01:21:02,474
and then .. nothing.

847
01:21:03,443 --> 01:21:05,519
You've reached the bottom, man!

848
01:21:37,606 --> 01:21:41,351
10-13! 10-13
an agent needs help!

849
01:21:41,486 --> 01:21:43,311
- Suspect...
- Nick're good?

850
01:21:43,445 --> 01:21:46,480
Yes, yes ,. I'm fine.
Male.... black hair.

851
01:22:17,778 --> 01:22:19,727
It could be anywhere.

852
01:22:19,863 --> 01:22:21,728
If you see someone who looks like he

853
01:22:21,822 --> 01:22:23,814
even remotely
give me a sign!

854
01:22:23,992 --> 01:22:26,153
Megan, I'm going home broken.

855
01:22:26,329 --> 01:22:27,986
So rest.

856
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,310
- I hope you whiskey!
- Yes.

857
01:23:04,748 --> 01:23:08,491
Yes, check all hospitals
suspect is injured.

858
01:23:08,711 --> 01:23:09,785
Yes, it's good.

859
01:23:10,421 --> 01:23:12,787
Chief, will you do me another favor?

860
01:23:13,049 --> 01:23:15,957
Thanks.
Preserve the unity here in front.

861
01:23:22,517 --> 01:23:24,092
I need it.

862
01:23:28,691 --> 01:23:30,933
Almost killed you not.

863
01:23:33,238 --> 01:23:34,426
Yes, indeed!

864
01:23:40,870 --> 01:23:43,824
I did not put you in that situation
.

865
01:23:45,879 --> 01:23:47,912
Megan's wrong.

866
01:23:51,426 --> 01:23:52,917
Passed.

867
01:24:02,479 --> 01:24:03,637
Passed.

868
01:24:05,648 --> 01:24:07,099
I'm afraid Nick.

869
01:24:10,070 --> 01:24:11,062
I'm afraid.

870
01:28:08,591 --> 01:28:11,418
Damn has a gun!
Go! Come on!

871
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:13,005
He ran!

872
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:23,224
Call the ambulance!

873
01:28:24,611 --> 01:28:26,477
Boss! Tell us something!

874
01:28:26,738 --> 01:28:28,899
Please tell us what happened!

875
01:28:29,201 --> 01:28:31,483
E wounded agent, huh?

876
01:28:36,583 --> 01:28:37,604
Megan!

877
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:44,153
Are you better?

878
01:28:45,175 --> 01:28:46,419
He was.

879
01:28:47,429 --> 01:28:48,129
Yes.

880
01:28:50,641 --> 01:28:52,883
- Now try to rest!
- Nick?

881
01:28:53,145 --> 01:28:54,217
'll Be fine.

882
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:57,887
I'll be back later.

883
01:29:03,238 --> 01:29:05,524
- What time?
- Almost 5:00.

884
01:29:06,407 --> 01:29:08,609
In a little and the sun will rise.

885
01:29:12,999 --> 01:29:15,565
That makes me sleep a while.

886
01:29:59,594 --> 01:30:00,544
Megan!

887
01:30:12,694 --> 01:30:15,143
Sorry, you come here a minute?

888
01:30:18,492 --> 01:30:21,440
- Can I have a cigarette?
- Of course!

889
01:30:26,247 --> 01:30:27,071
Thanks.

890
01:30:27,418 --> 01:30:30,494
Sure, something bad happened.

891
01:33:45,099 --> 01:33:47,218
Police!
All the earth!

892
01:36:09,265 --> 01:36:10,590
Sit down!

892
01:36:11,305 --> 01:36:17,468
