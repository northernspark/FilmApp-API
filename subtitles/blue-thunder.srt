Murphy.
Where the hell's Murphy?

6
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:10,820
- Hey, Jafo! Go find Murphy.
- Yes, sir.

7
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,792
Sir, Lieutenant Kress
wants you on the pad.

8
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:29,672
Sir?

9
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:32,675
Lose something?

10
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,178
No. You're wanted on the pad.

11
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,855
- Mind if I ask what you're doing?
- No.

12
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,149
I don't mind at all.

13
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,200
Murph, feeling any pressure?

14
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:00,995
Yeah, about 15 pounds per
square inch at sea level.

15
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,955
Where's Montoya?

16
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:06,834
Don't you check the duty board?
He's on days.

17
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,377
I forgot.

18
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:12,173
You're flying with
that new guy, Lymangood.

19
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:16,302
- The what?
- Me. Lymangood.

20
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,430
Outstanding.

<i>Captain Maloney and Officer Reiss,
report to Operations.</i>

22
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:35,112
If it was me, I'd ground him.

23
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:36,739
He'll be all right.

24
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,118
Personally, I wouldn't fly with him
for a bull that pissed Jack Daniels.

25
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,412
Is that right?

26
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,773
- All set?
- Yeah. Yes, sir.

27
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,400
- You sure now?
- Yeah.

Murphy and Lymangood.

30
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,793
Where the hell's Montoya?

31
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,922
They say he put in for days after
that wingding that Murphy threw.

32
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,508
No shit. Let me call Departure.

33
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,760

38
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:54,692
Oh, I don't know.

39
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:59,113
I just put in for observer.
I kind of liked the idea of it.

40
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:03,743
No guns. No kicking in doors.
You know, just quiet.

41
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,412
Oh, yeah.

42
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:11,125
All these people! What do you
suppose they're all doing down there?

43
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:16,088
According to the latest statistics,
1,000,775,000 of them...

44
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,507
...are getting it on.

45
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,469
That many, huh?

<i>The rest are waiting

Well, let's see what we can see here.

48
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,270
I got a black guy in a beanie.

49
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,190
Looks like he's selling
dope out of a van.

50
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,318
- Is that a red beanie?
- Yeah, that's him.

51
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,487
This is primo, man.
You want it?

52
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:43,574
He's ours. Undercover Buy Program.

53
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,576
Right, right.

54
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:50,081
- You were at the briefing?
- Yes, sir. Guess I just forgot.

55
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,708
You're gonna fit right in.

56

<i>Air-12, we have

<i>He's armed and has a hostage.</i>

60
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,179
Well, call it in.

61
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,058
Air-12 to Central. Proceeding to
the 211 at Burbank and Vineland.

62
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,561
Let's get out of here, man!

63
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:15,731
Bitch!

64
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:22,863
You dumb idiot!

65
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,917
Air-12 to ground,
your guy's heading for the junkyard.

66
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:42,091
Orange shirt and a cowboy hat, huh?
Whatever happened to inconspicuous?

67
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,929
Hit him! Hit him with the light.

68
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:49,682
I got him.

69
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:56,313
- Jesus Christ!
- Welcome to Air Support.

70
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,372
- Call an ambulance.
- Right.

71
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,590
Look at that guy.

72
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,926
Ground units! A man with
a gun is behind that dumpster.

73
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,470
No, the other way!

74
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,597
We're going down.
We gotta dust him.

75
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,240
Hit the ground, son. Hit it!

76
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,662
Code 4. They got it knocked.

77
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:16,811
Sir, what was that business
with the watch?

78
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,024
Back in the Ready Room,
with the watch?

79
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,235
Sort of a test.

80
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,654
If you think you're going
over the edge...

81
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,948
...you lose your sense of time.

82
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,660
With your eyes shut, you can't
tell 25 seconds from 5.

83
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,162
I get it, sir. Yes, sir.

84
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:38,374
Stop calling me "sir."
You sound like David Copperfield.

85
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,334
Yes, sir. I mean, okay, sir.

86
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,212
Check that ride at 10:00.

87
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,215
- Which one?
- Underneath the tree.

88
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,342
How do you see that shit?

89
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,722
- See it?
- Yep.

90
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,977
- It's got no plates on it.
- Well, call it in.

91
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,979
Abandoned vehicle.

92
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:05,025
Air-12 to Central. Reporting
an abandoned vehicle. It's a-

93
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:06,694
Come on, what kind of car?

94
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,196
It's a light tan Chevy.

95
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,408
It's got no front plates.
It's got no plates at all.

96
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:17,121
It's near the top of the hill
on Linden Road.

97
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,790
Very good.

98
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,250
Oh, thanks.

99
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:46,108
What time have you got?
You got about 10:30?

100
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,777
Been talking to Montoya, haven't you?

101
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,114
Well, he did mention
something about Encino.

102
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:54,783
I suppose you deserve
full initiation.

103
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,453
You might as well
have your picture taken.

104
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:24,563
Montoya thinks she's
some kind of movie actress.

105
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:28,984
Just my damn luck if they
had her working overtime tonight.

106
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,320
Those bastards.

107
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:34,406
Slave drivers.
That's what they are.

108
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:37,701
They don't care how hard
they work you, as long-

109
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:40,246
Oh, my God! There she is.

110
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:49,713
She's fantastic! Do you think
she knows we're out here?

111
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:52,132
All she has to do is look
out the window.

112
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,385
10:30, right on the dot!

113
00:09:55,762 --> 00:10:00,683
If there's one quality that I admire
in a person, it's punctuality.

114
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:05,104
And flexibility.

115
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,733
If a person says that they're
gonna be at a certain place-

116
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,318
Oh, God!

117
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,241
How does she do that?
How does she do that?

118
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,285
Beats the hell out of me.

119
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,120
Don't push on the pedals!

120
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,001
Would you look at her tan?

121
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:35,134
It's so even!

122
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,513
Oh, my God!

123
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,273
- What do you want?
- Get the briefcase!

124
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,317
I think she doesn't know.

125
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:41,992
Somebody does.

126
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:46,497
<i>All units in the vicinity handle a rape

127
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:48,415

<i>Identify and handle, code 3.</i>

129

Oh, shit! Come on, let's go, man!

130
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:06,767
Around the back.

131
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,229
Hold it! Freeze!

132
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,372
He's bought it.
Get on the other guy.

133
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,379
No, let them go!
Please, let them go!

134
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:38,924
- Over there.
- I got him.

135
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,673
Sir, you okay? Sir?

136
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,217
Fine.

137
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:27,931
Get an ambulance.

138
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:32,227
Air-12 requesting an ambulance
at 3920 Linden Road.

139
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,230
- How's the woman?
- She looks bad.

140
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,650
Oh, hell! It's gone.

141
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,695
The Chevy. The junker.
The Chevy.

142
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,490
It's gone.

143
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:54,708
For God's sake!

144
00:13:56,961 --> 00:14:01,381
Air-12, wind 150 degrees at 22,

Air-14, 1150 degrees at 12,
clear for takeoff.

146
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,973
The old man wants to see
both of you. Right now!

147
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:17,648
- I like your haircut.
- I like yours too.

148
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:35,207
You know, one of the really
fun things about this job...

149
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,919
...is reading the complaints
of the public.

150
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:42,506
For example, tonight here
we have a fella...

151
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:46,635
...that didn't appreciate us
disturbing his sleep.

152
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:52,683
I just hope I'm not called on
by the chief to explain...

153
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:57,604
...why two of my people were
hovering over Encino at 10:30...

154
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,899
...while Commissioner McNeely
was getting beaten...

155
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:04,361
...in her own front yard
in fashionable Brentwood.

156
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,115
McNeely? That's her?

157
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:11,076
Of the mayor's Task Force
on Urban Violence.

158
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,162
A touch of irony, if you
like that sort of thing.

159
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,124
- How is she?
- She was shot, Frank.

160
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,669
She's in Intensive Care.
Shot by one of the rapists.

161
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,130
One of the rapists?

162
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,717
Assault. Attempted rape.
That's what they're calling it.

163
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,135
There wasn't any rape.

164
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:31,096
Case is closed.
There's two toes tagged in the morgue.

165
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:35,225
That abandoned car we called in?
The Chevy. That was a stakeout.

166
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:39,605
No stakeout. A make-out.
Kids who couldn't afford a motel.

167
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:43,066
Kids go to Mulholland.
That's not the pattern.

168
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:46,445
Forget patterns, Frank.
And get the hell off my desk, will you?

169
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:48,572
Get off!

170
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,577
All right.

171
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,622
It doesn't bother you
that car has no plates?

172
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,999
That it wasn't there
when we came back?

173
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,917
That rapists don't travel in pairs?

174
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:05,714
What bothers me is, some son of
a bitch may ask what you were doing...

175
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,925
...five miles out of your patrol area!

176
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,094
When I talk to you,
I'll look at you.

177
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:14,640
It was my fault. I talked
Murphy into taking us there.

178
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:18,602
You're supposed to be stupid, son.
Don't abuse the privilege.

179
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:22,564
You think I haven't heard about
that silly twit out in Encino?

180
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:27,903
I had 20 years in this outfit when
you were sitting in front of the TV...

181
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:31,782
...watching Bugs Bunny,
gnawing on your Fudgsicle.

182
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:39,706
Remember, Officer Murphy, there are
people who don't like police officers.

183
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:44,544
They do not like the idea of
helicopters flying over their homes...

184
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,463
...peeking in their windows.

185
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:49,341
You know what they'll do?
They'll burn you...

186
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:53,261
...me, your idiotic friend here,
and my whole damn division.

187
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,138
I don't want my division burnt!

188
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,766
So here's the way it's coming down
with you guys!

189
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,770
- You're grounded. Both of you!
- Grounded?

190
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,941
I gotta figure out where to hide you
until this crap blows over.

191
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,276
Get out of here, Lymangood.

192
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,737
I mean, dismissed.

193
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,785
Stick around, Frank.

194
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:26,586
The review board wants to have you
up for psychiatric re-evaluation.

195
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,171
Oh, come on!

196
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:31,258
What do you expect after your
wig-out last month?

197
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:37,889
But there's a bright side
to this. And a moral.

198
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:40,600
Morals are good for you.
I love morals.

199
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:45,647
And the moral of this story is:
If you are walking on eggs, don't hop.

200
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,234
That's it.

201
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,707
Don't hop!

202
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,252
<i>Hello. Listen, it's me.</i>

203
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:35,048
<i>I don't know whether a post card from
Laguna means we're speaking again...</i>

204
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,677
<i>... but call me when you get in, okay?</i>

205
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:43,598
<i>Even if you're not speaking, call me.
Please? Okay, huh? Please, huh?</i>

206
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:50,772
<i>Hello. I'm back.</i>

207
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:53,400
<i>Is there no getting
rid of this chick?</i>

208
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:59,281
<i>The reason I'm pressing is that
I've got a really big favor I need.</i>

209
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,950
<i>I'm desperate! Desperate!</i>

210
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,620
<i>No matter what time it is, call me.</i>

211
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:08,206
<i>Please. Bye.</i>

212
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:34,941
Freeze!

213
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,484
For chrissake, Murphy!

214
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,573
You wanna get yourself killed?

215
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:45,660
You bozo! How many burglars come
in the front door with a key?

216
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:49,164
- You scared the shit out of me.
- I'm sorry.

217
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,749
Came to make friends.

218
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,087
Here's your key.

219
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,801
Well, I guess that makes
that official.

220
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,181
Where's my blender? I need it.

221
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:08,975
At 3:00 a. M.?

222
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:12,437
You have this problem.
You don't return phone calls.

223
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,147
In the kitchen.

224
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:17,817
Hold him for me.

225
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,613
This kid must be deaf.

226
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:26,326
- You coming?
- Where?

227
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:29,204
The Shocks' anniversary party.
You remember.

228
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:33,500
Annie's been open for a year now.
We're gonna have guacamole...

229
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:36,044
...and margaritas...

230
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,505
...and chili rellenos-

231
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,510
Fat chance, huh?

232
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:47,472
That must've been some leave
you had in Laguna.

233
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:50,809
What did you do? Spend all your
time on the pistol range?

234
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,186
Here it is!

235
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,899
What's this?

236
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,158
This is beautiful. Really!

237
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,913
- Could I please borrow this-?
- No.

238
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,206
I'll wash it.

239
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,668
It already belongs to you.
I bought it for your birthday.

240
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,421
- Really?
- I thought I gave you that damn thing.

241
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:22,716
Never mind. This is beautiful.
I love it!

242
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:28,555
Frank, I miss you.

243
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:30,515
I don't eat. I don't seem to sleep.

244
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:32,976
Maybe you ought to trade me
in on a surfer.

245
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:37,939
Well, I tried that once,
but it didn't work.

246
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,067
Come to think of it, neither did he.

247
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:43,111
Good night, Murphy.

248
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,741
Good night, you little faker.

249
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,452
Watch your legs.

250
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,497
Frank...

251
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,210
...we gotta get serious.

252
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:03,965
Now, I know you have a lot
of problems right now...

253
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:06,926
...and I'd really like to help you.

254
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,679
"You can run, but you can't hide."

255
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:14,225
- Joe Louis. That's very good.
- That's what I mean!

256
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:19,064
Frank, I'm gonna have to get tough
on you. Are you ready for that?

257
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:21,316
I'm ready.

258
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:52,097
<i>Five, four, three, two, one...</i>

259
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:53,973
Cue Mario, take one.

260
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:58,853
<i>The top story is still the assault
and attempted rape of Diana McNeely...</i>

261
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:01,648
<i>... of the mayor's
Task Force on Urban Violence.</i>

262
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:03,983
<i>McNeely's still on
the critical list.</i>

263
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:06,986
<i>We spoke to Chief Jensen
about the latest news.</i>

264
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,948
<i>We have nothing
on the two assailants.</i>

265
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:12,617
<i>They were without identification...</i>

266
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:16,496
<i>... probably Latin American and almost
certainly illegal aliens.</i>

267
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:19,707
<i>Our fingerprint teams are going
over their car...</i>

268
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:23,044
<i>... which was stolen from
a Santa Monica parking lot.</i>

269
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,589
<i>It is unclear what impact
this incident will have...</i>

270
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:31,177
<i>... on the minority community, and
the increasing racial tensions that-</i>

271
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:33,596
<i>We've just received word...</i>

272
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:37,851
<i>... that Alf Hewitt is standing by
St. Joseph's for a live report.</i>

273
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:41,104
<i>Commissioner Diana McNeely
died at 8:47 a. M...</i>

274
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:44,774
<i>... from a gunshot wound
which penetrated her neck...</i>

275
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:48,153
<i>... and lodged beneath
the third cervical vertebrae.</i>

276
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:49,988
<i>She never regained
consciousness...</i>

277
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:53,116
<i>... and if she had lived,
would've been paralysed.</i>

278
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:56,411
<i>This is Alf Hewitt,
from St. Joseph's Hospital.</i>

279
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:22,622
I've been trying to reach you. Why
don't you answer your beeper?

280
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:27,585
I just want to tell you that next time
I'm suspended, so's my fucking beeper!

281
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:31,047
<i>- Feel better?
- Yeah, a little.</i>

282
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:35,260
Get down here. We just came
up with a mince pie under each arm.

283
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,397
You're back on flying status.

284
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:50,733
You're assigned a special detail.

285
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:57,156
This is Mr. Icelan.
Mr. Fletcher of Washington.

286
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:58,574
This is Frank Murphy.

287
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:03,413
We're glad we found you. We're due
at the weapons testing range at-

288
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,374
- What do they call that place?
- Pinkville.

289
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:10,211
Everything I'm about to tell
you is highly classified.

290
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:14,924
Don't discuss it with anybody. We're
testing a new helicopter prototype.

291
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:17,468
We've got our own pilot...

292
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:20,763
...but your city's been chosen
as the testing area...

293
00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:24,267
...and your mayor is anxious that
his people participate.

294
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,269
Ours is not to reason why...

295
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:30,356
...ours is but to submit
to the vagaries of local politicians.

296
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:51,544
Smoke? Frank, is it?

297
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:53,880
No. Yes.

298
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:57,342
No: Smoke. Yes: Frank.

299
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:05,850
I understand you flew in Nam, Frank.

300
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,477
That's right.

301
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,772
- Two tours, was it?
- One and a half.

302
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,774
Why the foreshortened tour?

303
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:15,818
You know what they say about
a second chest wound.

304
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:18,529
It's nature's way of telling you
it's time to go home.

305
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:19,864
Yeah, right. Right.

306
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,866
You gonna tell us
about this special detail?

307
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:25,828
A lot of people are looking
forward to the Olympics out here.

308
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:30,625
For a few short weeks, the attention
of the world will be on this town.

309
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,752
Every nutcase and terrorist...

310
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:36,964
...and crazy with a pipe bomb and
a cause is drooling about it.

311
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:39,384
That's what this detail's all about.

312
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:42,095
The potential for catastrophe.

313
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:45,306
We don't want any Munich
massacres out here, Frank.

314
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,601
Are you talking about
crowd control from the air?

315
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:51,062
Give that man a cigar.

316
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:54,107
That's been tried.
It didn't work out so hot.

317
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:56,275
- Where was that?
- Vietnam.

318
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,489
We added a few new wrinkles.

319
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:05,243
- Such as?
- You'll see, Frank. You'll see.

320
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:30,101
This thing has antiterrorist
capabilities. You saying it's armed?

321
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:33,479
That I am. That it is.

322
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,898
That sounds like it now.

323
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,026
It's illegal to arm
police helicopters.

324
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:42,029
That would depend on the
circumstances, wouldn't it?

325
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:44,449
A lot of people ain't gonna like this.

326
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,368
What do you call this,
an "airbuster"?

327
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,872
The Special. But somebody hung
a nickname on it.

328
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:54,250
- What?
- Somebody hung a nickname on it.

329
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,335
Blue Thunder.

330
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:30,745
Okay, gentlemen, you wanna
take your seats? Here she comes.

331
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:36,375
She don't look normal...

332
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:40,755
...she don't fly normal,
because she ain't normal.

333
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:53,976
This whole ship is heavily armored...

334
00:30:54,228 --> 00:30:58,147
...with Nordoc NATO armor
one inch thick.

335
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:03,361
This ship is equipped with a forward
mounted 20 mm electric cannon.

336
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:06,447
Its six barrels are capable...

337
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:11,953
...of firing 4000 rounds
of ammunition per minute.

338
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:16,457
And that, gentlemen, is one hell of
a shit storm in anybody's language.

339
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:19,168
Now, let's take a look...

340
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,046
...and watch the lady strut her stuff.

341
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:32,640
The red dummies are terrorists, white
are civilians. Innocent bystanders.

342
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,813
The object is for our pilot
to knock out...

343
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:41,440
...the red dummies and the black cars.

344
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,360
He shouldn't touch any of the others.

345
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:48,948
In a riot situation, we just
want to get the bad guys...

346
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,950
...and protect the innocents.

347
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,513
Oh, my God!

348
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:18,978
That kind of firepower would be
used in our worst-case scenario...

349
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,730
...like armed insurrection.

350
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,566
It's comforting to know
you got it on tap.

351
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,651
Gentlemen, let me have your attention.

352
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,862
Notice the selectivity of the firing.

353
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:31,574
This is not a strafing run
where you tear up a whole street.

354
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:35,745
This little lady picks her targets
carefully. Now you watch.

355
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:11,781
Look at that. All the red
dummies are blown to hell.

356
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:13,282
And a few white ones.

357
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:18,204
One civilian dead for every 10
terrorists. An acceptable ratio.

358
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:21,040
Unless you're one of the civilians.

359
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:26,337
All right. Last pass, gentlemen.
Anybody wanna bet on the school bus?

360
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,152
We haven't told our pilot
everything about the bus.

361
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:53,906
Let's see if he can pick up
on what's wrong with it.

362
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,808
Damn it! Bloody gun!

363
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:41,579
Now, if you come down below,
we'll take a closer look...

364
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:45,583
...and I'll be glad to answer
any questions you may have.

365
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,899
Terrific shooting, colonel.
It was beautiful.

366
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,692
Beautiful, was it?

367
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,695
Goddamn it! I had another stoppage.

368
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,702
I nearly killed you
on that second pass.

369
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,580
If it happens again,
I'll have their balls.

370
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:27,041
There's somebody I want you to meet.

371
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:29,168
Well, what do you know!

372
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,295
Friend of yours?

373
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:36,509
An old war buddy. The bastard tried
to have me court-martialled once.

374
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,927
Sorry I brought it up.

375
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:39,386
Look who it isn't.

376
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:42,640
Colonel, this is Captain
Braddock of Astro Division.

377
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:46,435
And Frank Murphy. He'll do
the actual testing over the city.

378
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:49,271
Finally made colonel?

379
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,982
If you're nice, nice things
happen to you.

380
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:54,401
I'll try to remember that.

381
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,697
Step this way for any questions.

382
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,661
How did we draw him?

383
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,038
He and his observer
were assigned to us.

384
00:36:06,248 --> 00:36:09,875
- I didn't realize you were acquainted.
- Only too well, I'm afraid.

385
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:13,796
I'd have had him up on charges
if he hadn't caught some shrapnel.

386
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,799
He's totally unsuitable
for our purpose.

387
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,634
I'll call Mr. Holmes tonight.

388
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:21,345
Don't bother him.
I think we can handle it.

389
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:25,933
- 30 million candlepower
night sun with an infrared filter.

390
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:29,353
Over here is your TV camera,
with 100-to-1 zoom lens.

391
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:34,483
- We could've used this in Nam.
- We could've used something.

392
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,735
Do you think you can fly it?

393
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:39,655
You flew it, didn't you?

394
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:43,909
I'll check you out myself.

395
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,162
Be on the pad, 12 sharp.

396
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:49,039
Twelve sharp.

397
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,376
Catch you later.

398
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,296
Stand back from there.

399
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:58,507
Irritating little cocksucker,
isn't he?

400
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:10,936
- Hey. Tequila breath!
- My man in the sky.

401
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:15,065
- How do you like day shifts?
- My bride's happier. But me?

402
00:37:15,317 --> 00:37:18,903
- What's happening?
- I gotta go take a flight check.

403
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:21,155
What do you make of this?

404
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,740
What it is?

405
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:25,659
I found it where
Diana McNeely was killed.

406
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:28,662
I think it's about
that urban violence stuff.

407
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:30,748
Can you translate this?
It's in Spanish.

408
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:33,667
I gotta log in, but I'll
get back to you later.

409
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:35,377
Keep it under your hat.

410
00:37:35,629 --> 00:37:37,755
Right under the hat.
Look at this!

411
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:40,215
I gotta get dressed.
I'll see you in a second.

412
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,259
Hey, how you doing?
Thanks for the hat.

413
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:44,720
- How's it going?
- What's this "JAFO" shit?

414
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:49,308
Look up. Look down.
Look left. Look right.

415
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,268
- Don't worry.
- What's JAFO?

416
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,148
You know what Montoya told me?

417
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:59,568
He told me you looped one
of those things. A helicopter.

418
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,946
He's putting me on, right?

419
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:03,280
No, he wasn't.

420
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,366
You actually looped a chopper?

421
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,451
- That's right.
- When?

422
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:10,371
When I was young and stupid.

423
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:27,304
You're telling me it was
a complete 360? Right over the top?

424
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:30,307
- A full loop.
- I thought that was impossible.

425
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:33,394
It is.
It's aerodynamically impossible.

426
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:36,605
Anyone who tells you any
different is a damn liar.

427
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:41,276
Now, you take the Ranger
and I'll be in my bird.

428
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:44,780
We'll have a little game.
Follow my leader.

429
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:47,241
Follow my leader.

430
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:52,162
Catch you later.

431
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:01,797
<i>Murphy, this is Cochrane.</i>

432
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:06,093
Join formation with me, echelon
right. And keep it tight.

433
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,386
Roger that, colonel.

434
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:11,890
Wanna show me that loop, Murphy?

435
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:15,102
Negatory.

436
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:19,440
I thought so.
Okay, slide over to my left.

437
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,622
Come on, keep it tight.

438
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,249
Christ!

439
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,252
Any closer, we start eating blades.

440
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:43,380
We're following his leader.

441
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:53,182
Now push it over and pick up speed.

442
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,859
Follow me through
a high-speed climbing turn.

443
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,795
Level out at 500 feet.

444
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:32,221
All right, Mr. Murphy.
You take the lead.

445
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:34,056
Roger that.

446
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:55,786
Damn! Damn it! Shit!

447
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,621
We got a runaway!

448
00:40:58,581 --> 00:40:59,748
Jeez! What was that?

449
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:06,088
Grab your ankles
and kiss your ass goodbye.

450
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:07,548
- We're going down.
- Shit!

451
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,095
Mayday! Mayday!

452
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:14,721
We're going down.

453
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:19,101
Willowbrook and Alameda.
Request ambulance, fire.

454
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:24,398
Shut the fuel off.
Shut the fuel off!

455
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:26,900
What? Fuel?

456
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:38,245
Heads up!

457
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,414
Jesus! Where'd that bus come from?

458
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:42,916
Steady. We're gonna
make a house call.

459
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:00,100
<i>Central, this is Blue Thunder.</i>

460
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:05,105
It seems that we have a ship down,
somewhere in the Watts area.

461
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:13,113
Are you all right?

462
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:16,450
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

463
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,243
Get the hell off me!

464
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:36,678
I hope you broke your fucking neck!

465
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:40,432
You could've killed half of my crew!

466
00:42:40,642 --> 00:42:44,436
You knocked down the whole damn
shack! Get the hell out of here!

467
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:50,525
- Listen, Dick. Thanks a lot.
- Be careful.

468
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:52,527
- Take care.
- See you.

469
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:06,959
Rather a near thing today.
I heard your turbine failed.

470
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:08,377
Or was it your flying?

471
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:10,629
Back off, asshole.

472
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,841
What's that I hear? Threats?

473
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:18,595
Well, what a change.
We are acting brave nowadays.

474
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:22,641
Are you threatening me, Murphy?

475
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:26,645
No, I'm telling you. Back off.

476
00:43:27,689 --> 00:43:28,689
Catch you later.

477
00:43:57,677 --> 00:44:00,929
- Can I see your watch?
- Sure.

478
00:44:02,015 --> 00:44:03,849
You know where it is, don't you?

479
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:05,976
Are you losing weight?

480
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:09,062
Getting older too. I think you
have to turn up here.

481
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:10,731
Getting enough sleep?

482
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:14,192
Are we having two different
conversations or I am going nuts?

483
00:44:14,444 --> 00:44:17,946
The train ride. The train ride.
I'll find it.

484
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:21,408
- If you don't run out of gas first.
- What?

485
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:25,162
When that needle points to empty,
it means you're out of gas.

486
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:27,414
That's broken.
We got plenty.

487
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,959
Mommy! You missed the train ride.

488
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:33,462
Hang on.

489
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:39,092
- Are you crazy?
- This a one-way street!

490
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:41,303
I won't tell if you won't tell!

491
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:46,266
Jeez, look out!

492
00:44:54,484 --> 00:44:56,943
I'll tell you one thing,
it's awfully hard to read.

493
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:59,363
- Yeah, I know.
- It's part of a letter.

494
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:04,242
It says something about strangers
in the barrio making trouble.

495
00:45:04,494 --> 00:45:07,621
I don't know. Something
like that. Here's a word...

496
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:10,624
...that isn't in Spanish:
"Thor."

497
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:13,335
T- H-O-R.

498
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:16,213
- Thor? No.
- Mean anything?

499
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:21,635
Strangers in the barrio
making trouble.

500
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:26,223
I don't know.

501
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:31,561
Maybe I've been in this too long, but
I think something bad's coming down.

502
00:45:31,813 --> 00:45:35,607
<i>Most of the official family
of Los Angeles, led by the mayor...</i>

503
00:45:35,817 --> 00:45:39,111
<i>... and the City Council, gathered
with family members...</i>

504
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,531
<i>... and members of the black community
at McNeely's funeral...</i>

505
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:45,826
<i>... who was tragically murdered
several days ago.</i>

506
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:47,077
Food's up!

507
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:49,996
<i>McNeely, who chaired
the Commission on Urban Violence...</i>

508
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:53,583
<i>... was an outspoken critic of
police department policies.</i>

509
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:57,212
<i>The chief was in evidence as were
many of his aides.</i>

510
00:45:57,672 --> 00:46:00,882
<i>As temperatures stay high
and tempers continue to fray...</i>

511
00:46:01,134 --> 00:46:03,885
<i>... fires continue in
the Watts area...</i>

512
00:46:04,137 --> 00:46:07,931
<i>... the City of Industry, Pacoima
and East Los Angeles.</i>

513
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,268
You want ketchup on your sandwich?

514
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:17,315
Now where did he go?

515
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:19,192
Hey, Frank.

516
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,112
Frank, did you say you wanted-?

517
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,576
Frank?

518
00:46:28,995 --> 00:46:31,079
Frank, are you okay?

519
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:45,051
Frank.

520
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:49,848
Is this something kinky?

521
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:58,523
Goddamn your black Irish heart...

522
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:01,735
...Frances McNeil Murphy,
if you've left!

523
00:48:08,928 --> 00:48:12,222
These are your television monitors.
You have three.

524
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:15,475
The one in the center ties into
all your computer banks.

525
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,561
The switches:

526
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:19,354
Night vision.

527
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:22,190
Infrared filter. Target system.

528
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,652
Whisper mode
so you can travel silent.

529
00:48:26,279 --> 00:48:30,198
Audio, which controls your
outside mikes which are here.

530
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:31,658
What's the sensitivity?

531
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:34,369
You can hear a mouse fart
at 2000 feet.

532
00:48:35,997 --> 00:48:40,125
Now, gentlemen. This is your
Harrison fire control helmet.

533
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,877
This baby is the heart of your system.

534
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:45,797
Let's take a look
and see how she works.

535
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:50,218
Watch this.

536
00:48:54,223 --> 00:48:56,975
It superimposes the gun cues
on the real world.

537
00:48:57,226 --> 00:48:59,978
Wherever you look, the guns follow.

538
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,523
You can zero in on
any target you want...

539
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:06,985
...just by putting the green
tracer line on your target.

540
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:13,325
- You wanna give it a shot?
- Yeah.

541
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:22,083
What's that, 3/4-inch video?

542
00:49:22,335 --> 00:49:23,877
You know something about it?

543
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:27,297
- That was my rate in the Navy.
- What ship?

544
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:30,675
<i>- Midway.
- No shit. I was on the Forrestal.</i>

545
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:33,511
It's a hell of a setup.
Let me show you.

546
00:49:33,763 --> 00:49:36,681
It goes in a locked memory bank
here in the belly.

547
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:40,018
Each reel is code-numbered.

548
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:46,816
This little bug erases the tape on
a signal from Central Command.

549
00:49:47,068 --> 00:49:49,778
The tape's gotta be inside
the case to erase.

550
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:53,239
It only erases in the case?
That's great.

551
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:56,951
Adjust for your eye until the red
dot rides on your tracer line.

552
00:49:57,203 --> 00:50:01,331
Then press the cannon button and zap!
Where you look is where you hit.

553
00:50:01,582 --> 00:50:04,250
Sunshine! Just blew your
gizzard away.

554
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:09,005
What's all this shit I hear
about you threatening Cochrane?

555
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:12,133
Thank you, sergeant.

556
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:15,470
What?

557
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:19,099
In the police garage.
After your crack-up.

558
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:21,101
Feeling a little hostility?

559
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:23,186
I told him to back off, that's all.

560
00:50:23,396 --> 00:50:25,271
That's all? Well, it's enough.

561
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:30,318
They don't care if you kill yourself.
They got $5 million in this aircraft.

562
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:32,612
They don't want to see it totaled.

563
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,280
Some kind of bullshit.

564
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:38,243
Hey.

565
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,746
If you want my opinion...

566
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:45,291
...I think the feds are after your ass.
Better watch it.

567
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:49,254
Okay, thanks.

568
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:55,510
Hey, Matusek? How do you control
the oscillation of the quartz?

569
00:50:55,720 --> 00:51:00,098
It's the difference between the output
of the generator signals. See?

570
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:02,809
Hey, Jafo. This isn't
any night school.

571
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,311
We got a test flight
to make out there.

572
00:51:06,856 --> 00:51:10,108
- Good night.
- Good night, kid. Take it easy.

573
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:22,620
- Big Brother, on or off?
- What's Big Brother?

574
00:51:22,872 --> 00:51:25,540
The cabin mike.
It records everything we say.

575
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:27,667
I think we can lose that.

576
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:30,128
I got the fuse right here.

577
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:33,256
Get your hat off those
circuit breakers.

578
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:36,342
Tell me what JAFO is.
I'm putting the fuse here.

579
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:38,970
You'll find out. Just be patient.

580
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,890
Night vision. Checked, okay.

581
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:44,517
Target systems checked, okay.

582
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:48,313
Let's see what's on HBO tonight, okay?
Check.

583
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:52,650
Blue Thunder to tower,
requests permission for takeoff.

584
00:51:52,902 --> 00:51:57,489
Blue Thunder, Tower unable to issue
departure clearance at this time.

585
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:01,075
This isn't a very good idea.
He hasn't even got clearance.

586
00:52:01,327 --> 00:52:03,536
It's just an orientation flight.

587
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:07,457
Holmes is arriving tonight.
Let him take care of it.

588
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:09,584
- What do you want?
- Clear him.

589
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:13,505
Blue Thunder, Tower.
Wind 330 degrees at 15.

590
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:15,381
Clear for takeoff.

591
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:23,765
<i>Roger, Tower.
Blue Thunder off at 2030.</i>

592
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:28,311
<i>Be coming to you.
Traffic advisories.</i>

593
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:31,022
Let's hope he knows what he's doing.

594
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:49,916
How does she fly?

595
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,293
It's nose-heavier than the ayatollah.

596
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:56,047
- You're crazy. This stuff's great.
- Great, huh?

597
00:52:57,633 --> 00:53:01,761
- Okay, let's see what this turkey's got.
- Let's go!

598
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:33,167
Hey. Hey.

599
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:36,296
- Orbit right. Orbit right.
- What?

600
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:38,923
<i>- Hi, there.
- Hi.</i>

601
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:40,383
You gotta hear this.

602
00:53:40,593 --> 00:53:44,679
<i>I wondered if you knew where a guy
could get something good to eat.</i>

603
00:53:44,889 --> 00:53:48,349
<i>It depends on what a guy's
hungry for. Know what I mean?</i>

604
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,184
I'm going to video.

605
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:53,229
<i>A little sushi would be nice.</i>

606
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,733
- Sushi?
- Remember the last time we did this?

607
00:53:58,152 --> 00:54:00,945
- Try the zoom.
- Zoom, right.

608
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:03,114
<i>Seventy-five?</i>

609
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:06,242
<i>Are we talking about American money?</i>

610
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,202
<i>We certainly are.</i>

611
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:09,829
<i>Come on, lady. You know-</i>

612
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:15,126
Look at this. Hot Chihuahua!

613
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:17,629
<i>Honey, that's a little steep.</i>

614
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,923
I want it! I want it!

615
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:22,967
Let's lose this asshole.
He's breaking my heart.

616
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:25,136
Come on. We gotta go to work.

617
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:28,097
Bye-bye.

618
00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:38,566
I dig this police work.

619
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:40,735
Yeah. You're breathing heavy.

620
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:44,530
All right, here goes the whisper mode.

621
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:46,115
Whisper mode.

622
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,034
That's a check.

623
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:53,998
Hey, that's smooth!

624
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:56,167
Forest Lawn.

625
00:55:00,965 --> 00:55:04,008
Hey. Check this place over here
at 3:30.

626
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:06,344
Is that a state cycle in the driveway?

627
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:09,555
- That's highway patrol.
- Can you make the licence?

628
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:12,016
- Can you bring it around?
- Yeah.

629
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:24,570
That's 221 Bravo 6.

630
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:29,534
I know that cycle.
Jack Moran. Double Dork.

631
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:31,577
Double Dork?

632
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,079
Try that thermograph.

633
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:35,581
Thermograph.
Cutting in thermograph.

634
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:37,250
Coming in.

635
00:55:38,711 --> 00:55:40,795
The motor looks hot.

636
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:43,506
It hasn't been there too long.

637
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:47,468
- Want me to see if the owner's home?
- Sure. Can we do it?

638
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:50,805
That guy, Matusek,
he cleared me this morning.

639
00:55:51,015 --> 00:55:53,516
This sucker'll do everything
but cook your breakfast.

640
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:59,188
H-23.

641
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,607
Let's see, the house is right here.

642
00:56:01,817 --> 00:56:04,444
- She's there!
- How does the computer know?

643
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:06,988
They clear it with their
security patrol...

644
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:09,615
...and then they zap it right to us.

645
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:17,957
Let the good times roll!

646
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,548
<i>No. No.</i>

647
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:28,051
<i>Not yet. Not yet.</i>

648
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:30,219
<i>I'm not ready!</i>

649
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:37,602
<i>Stupid putz!</i>

650
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:40,772
Sounds like old Double Dork
is missing a step or two.

651
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:43,608
- We recorded all this?
- It's all on tape.

652
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:45,902
Locked in the memory bank
in the belly.

653
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:50,073
I think old Double Dork's
entitled to a quickie. Don't you?

654
00:56:50,282 --> 00:56:51,699
Absolutely.

655
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:53,743
Can you erase that tape?

656
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:56,370
The memory bank's locked,
but I can get in.

657
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:57,955
Good.

658
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:06,297
This mother hears through walls,
fires 4000 rounds a minute...

659
00:57:06,507 --> 00:57:09,425
...and peeks down dresses at
1000 feet. Jesus Christ!

660
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:14,055
This terminal here is hooked
into every data bank that there is.

661
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,516
A dozen of these and you
could run the country.

662
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:19,644
Watch this.
I feed it my name, right?

663
00:57:25,317 --> 00:57:27,777
They got your whole life in here.

664
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,071
Hit mine.

665
00:57:31,323 --> 00:57:33,074
Murphy...

666
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:35,326
...Frankie.

667
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,589
File under repair?

668
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:51,300
Did you break your file?
That's weird.

669
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:53,302
<i>Special Base to Blue Thunder.</i>

670
00:57:53,554 --> 00:57:54,846
Blue Thunder.

671
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:58,432
<i>- It's a wrap tonight. Come on home.
- 10-4.</i>

672
00:57:58,642 --> 00:58:00,726
Right, I'd better get going.

673
00:58:01,353 --> 00:58:03,646
You'd better go too, Mr. Fletcher.

674
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:07,400
I'll come along there when he's in.

675
00:58:07,568 --> 00:58:09,152
Yeah, right.

676
00:58:18,537 --> 00:58:21,914
<i>Blue Thunder, wind 270 degrees at 12.</i>

677
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:24,208
Blue Thunder to base,
final approach.

678
00:58:25,085 --> 00:58:29,046
Altimeter, two-niner-niner-five.
Cleared to land.

679
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:48,774
Does Cochrane drive a gray Corvette?

680
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:49,942
Yeah. Why?

681
00:58:50,194 --> 00:58:53,029
Check 9:00.
He's in some kind of hurry.

682
00:58:54,615 --> 00:58:55,907
Oh, yeah.

683
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:02,538
Listen. Check Cochrane out.

684
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:05,666
- On the computer?
- Yeah. I'm gonna tag along.

685
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:18,137
Blue Thunder, this is Tower.

686
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,306
Do you copy?
Is there a problem?

687
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:23,726
That's Cochrane, F.E., U.S. Army.

688
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:26,979
F.E. What's F.E. Stand for?

689
00:59:27,189 --> 00:59:28,940
"Fuck Everybody."

690
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:30,274
Gnarly!

691
00:59:32,361 --> 00:59:33,486
We're almost there.

692
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:36,656
<i>This is Tower. Do you copy?</i>

693
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:40,409
Base, you're coming in garbled.
Can't read you.

694
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:41,577
I got Washington.

695
00:59:44,665 --> 00:59:45,748
Go for it.

696
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:49,585
Cannot read you, Special Base.
Still garbled.

697
00:59:49,795 --> 00:59:52,088
Blue Thunder, come in.
Do you read me?

698
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:56,050
Breaking up, Special Base.
Can't read you. Still garbled.

699
00:59:59,263 --> 01:00:00,554
Here it comes.

700
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:10,481
"Project Thor." Wait.
Find out what that is.

701
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:12,817
Request information:

702
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:17,780
Thor Project.

703
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:28,416
I got it. Here it comes.

704
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:33,379
"Tactical Helicopter
Offensive Response."

705
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:38,217
Offensive Response?

706
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:40,594
What does that mean?

707
01:00:41,013 --> 01:00:44,890
Washington's jerking us around.
They've got bigger plans for this.

708
01:00:49,271 --> 01:00:52,523
<i>- Blue Thunder, you will acknowledge.
- Oh, shit!</i>

709
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:56,110
Blue Thunder to Special Base-

710
01:00:57,321 --> 01:00:58,821
Oh, shit!

711
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,382
- He's going in there.
- Yeah.

712
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:19,592
Where are we?

713
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,552
- Federal Building.
- Really?

714
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:23,971
Wanna find out what's going on?

715
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:26,307
Certainly.
Here goes the whisper mode.

716
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:41,614
You get anything?

717
01:01:42,074 --> 01:01:44,950
I just had a good shot of
some guys emptying trash.

718
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,202
Can't use it.

719
01:01:46,453 --> 01:01:49,121
Goddamn it to hell!
What's going on out there?

720
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:52,249
I'm holding you responsible
for that man's behavior.

721
01:01:52,501 --> 01:01:55,753
Dr. Haycock strongly recommended
he be grounded.

722
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:58,047
For your information, Mr. Icelan...

723
01:01:58,256 --> 01:02:01,592
...there are no paranoid
schizophrenics on duty here.

724
01:02:01,802 --> 01:02:04,095
He checks his sanity with
his wristwatch!

725
01:02:04,304 --> 01:02:07,223
What do you check yours with?
A dipstick?

726
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,810
I don't have to take crap from you.

727
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:12,228
He's finished as of now.

728
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:15,231
If there's a scratch
on that aircraft, so are you.

729
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:17,691
All right, try the thermograph.

730
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:24,281
I told you it was cool.

731
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:26,367
Lovely, lovely!

732
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:32,915
- Park here.
- I'll bring it around.

733
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:34,291
I got something!

734
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:43,134
- It locked!
- Yeah. Hold it, hold it.

735
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:49,181
<i>I still fail to understand.</i>

736
01:02:49,433 --> 01:02:53,477
<i>The Astro Division is autonomous.
The man was assigned to us.</i>

737
01:02:53,687 --> 01:02:55,646
<i>- McNeely complicated it.
- Fletcher!</i>

738
01:02:55,897 --> 01:03:00,192
<i>I can't say you people have
covered yourselves with glory so far.</i>

739
01:03:00,444 --> 01:03:04,780
If she hadn't started shouting,
we wouldn't have had to rough her up.

740
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:06,532
Rough her up?

741
01:03:08,076 --> 01:03:10,411
Is that a euphemism
for "assassination"?

742
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,789
She had street informants,
and she'd made the connection...

743
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:17,001
...between our project
and the trouble in the streets.

744
01:03:17,252 --> 01:03:19,628
<i>She was going public, on the record.</i>

745
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:21,547
Who are these other guys?

746
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:23,966
- They can't hear me.
- Shut up anyway!

747
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:27,595
<i>- This pilot-
- Murphy. Frank Murphy.</i>

748
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:30,639
<i>Is that under control?
I don't want attention.</i>

749
01:03:30,891 --> 01:03:33,184
<i>Blue Thunder might be perceived
as a threat.</i>

750
01:03:33,435 --> 01:03:36,103
<i>- Drop the hammer on him.
- What do you think?</i>

751
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:40,065
I think, Mr. Holmes,
that I should take him out.

752
01:03:40,275 --> 01:03:41,901
<i>You mean kill him?</i>

753
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:44,862
<i>- When?
- As soon as possible.</i>

754
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:46,864
Jesus Christ, Frank!

755
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:49,450
The boy loves me!
You got this on tape?

756
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:51,744
- I got every word of it.
- Good.

757
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:53,996
<i>Give him all the help he needs.</i>

758
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:56,207
<i>This conversation never took place.</i>

759
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:58,250
<i>If it gets back to me, I'll deny it.</i>

760
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:05,257
Oh, shit!

761
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:12,973
We're in deep shit!
Let's get the hell out!

762
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:31,325
<i>Tower, we have 330 degrees and 15.</i>

763
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:34,703
<i>Altimeter still 3000.
Clear to land?</i>

764
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:38,374
<i>Air-12 traffic, 1:00
two miles north-eastbound.</i>

765
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:40,751
<i>It's a Cessna 182 at 5000 VFR.</i>

766
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:44,505
<i>Blue Thunder down at 2130.</i>

767
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:48,217
Captain wants to see you
in the office right away.

768
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:52,388
- I'll get the tape's keycard.
- Be careful.

769
01:04:57,769 --> 01:04:59,019
Yes, sir. I will.

770
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:02,815
Well, sir, he's-
He's not that-

771
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:06,151
Very well, sir.

772
01:05:06,695 --> 01:05:07,820
I will.

773
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:11,282
All right, sir. I will.

774
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:13,033
Yes, thank you.

775
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:18,122
- Did you have a nice flight?
- I enjoyed it.

776
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:20,708
I hope so. It's
your last for a while.

777
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:23,294
- Now listen, Jack-
- No, you listen.

778
01:05:23,503 --> 01:05:24,962
That's how it is from now on:

779
01:05:25,213 --> 01:05:27,131
Me captain, you cop.
Me talk, you listen.

780
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:30,676
If I don't have an ass
when I get out of this chair...

781
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:33,095
...it's because
the old man chewed it off.

782
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:46,191
You're beautiful when you're angry,
but let's talk privately.

783
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:49,111
We don't have any secrets
from Mr. Icelan.

784
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:52,656
You're off the program, Frank.
You and your buddy Lymangood.

785
01:05:52,866 --> 01:05:55,367
I'll be lucky if I'm not
in Pacoima tomorrow...

786
01:05:55,577 --> 01:05:57,036
...driving a black-and-white.

787
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,832
Captain Braddock speaking.

788
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:03,959
Yes, sir.
He's here, colonel.

789
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:07,880
Icelan.

790
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,552
Guys, don't forget
to check under the hood.

791
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:15,804
Just gonna get my cuff links.

792
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:30,361
Who are you conning
with that phony radio bullshit?

793
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:34,698
For chrissakes, that went out 3 days
after Marconi invented it!

794
01:06:39,871 --> 01:06:41,664
Captain Braddock speaking.

795
01:06:44,042 --> 01:06:45,209
Yes, sir.

796
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,629
Yes, sir.
It's taken care of.

797
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:08,691
Who unlocked the memory bank?

798
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:10,734
That tall numb-nuts cop.

799
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:13,987
- Lymangood?
- You got it.

800
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:15,614
Son of a bitch!

801
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:51,775
Hey!

802
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:58,282
Get his gun!

803
01:08:09,294 --> 01:08:10,335
Take it easy.

804
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:13,630
Pay attention. Pay attention!

805
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:16,884
- We don't wanna hurt you.
- We want the tape.

806
01:08:17,802 --> 01:08:19,052
Let's be reasonable.

807
01:08:19,304 --> 01:08:21,722
You'll tell us what we wanna know
sooner or later.

808
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:24,433
And I think you'd rather it be sooner.

809
01:08:25,393 --> 01:08:29,062
Because first, we're gonna
break your fingers...

810
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:32,775
...then your arm,
then maybe your knees.

811
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:36,570
Now, I know you don't believe me...

812
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:38,739
...so I'm gonna show you.

813
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:50,459
Now, can it be sooner?

814
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:53,128
The tape.

815
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:55,547
It's in your car?

816
01:08:57,926 --> 01:08:59,301
Check the car.

817
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:19,279
You wanna tell us where it is?

818
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:28,288
You wanna write it down?
Thattaboy!

819
01:11:43,675 --> 01:11:46,802
<i>All units, detain
and hold for questioning...</i>

820
01:11:47,053 --> 01:11:48,428
<i>... Officer Frank Murphy...</i>

821
01:11:48,638 --> 01:11:51,181
<i>... in connection with the death
of Officer Lymangood.</i>

822
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:54,476
<i>Possibly driving
a black '79 Trans Am...</i>

823
01:11:54,686 --> 01:11:57,437
<i>... California license,
909 King-Edward-Boy.</i>

824
01:11:57,647 --> 01:12:00,107
I want to get a confirmation on that.

825
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:02,192
This is Air-12 to Central.

826
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:05,028
<i>Can we get a confirmation
on that dispatch?</i>

827
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:09,741
<i>Black '79 Trans Am. California
license 909 King-Edward-Boy.</i>

828
01:12:09,993 --> 01:12:13,245
<i>Officer Frank Murphy.
Detain and hold for questioning...</i>

829
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:16,999
<i>... in connection with the death
of Officer Richard Lymangood.</i>

830
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:41,606
<i>So far, so good.</i>

831
01:12:41,816 --> 01:12:45,777
<i>Check out Big Brother's tape
in Blue Thunder to learn more.</i>

832
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:51,867
<i>I just heard about Lymangood.
I'm really sorry.</i>

833
01:12:52,118 --> 01:12:54,327
<i>Call me if you want to talk.</i>

834
01:13:35,078 --> 01:13:37,537
- Here's your tea, colonel.
- Thank you.

835
01:13:38,122 --> 01:13:39,915
Why don't we just blank the tape?

836
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:42,918
That's what it's
designed for, right?

837
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:46,922
They tell me Lymangood changed
the code numbers.

838
01:13:47,173 --> 01:13:50,634
To go through every possible
combination would take forever.

839
01:13:55,014 --> 01:13:57,307
The trouble is,
we don't have forever.

840
01:14:23,835 --> 01:14:25,877
<i>Hey, boss. How's it going?</i>

841
01:14:26,087 --> 01:14:28,004
<i>Listen, I got the tape...</i>

842
01:14:29,006 --> 01:14:31,216
<i>... but it's not safe
to take it home.</i>

843
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:34,970
<i>So I'm gonna-
There's this drive-in that I go to...</i>

844
01:14:35,221 --> 01:14:38,223
<i>... at Riverside and Victory,
on the corner.</i>

845
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:41,768
<i>There's a dumpster in the back,
behind the concession stand.</i>

846
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:45,272
<i>And I'm pretty sure
they don't empty it until Monday.</i>

847
01:14:45,523 --> 01:14:48,608
<i>So that's where I'm gonna
stash the tape, okay?</i>

848
01:14:49,527 --> 01:14:54,030
<i>This is getting kind of fun, huh?
Cops and robbers, for real!</i>

849
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:55,907
<i>Well...</i>

850
01:14:56,534 --> 01:14:59,369
<i>Good luck if you should decide
to accept this mission.</i>

851
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:01,955
<i>This is Lymangood.</i>

852
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:06,751
<i>I forgot to tell you.
I found out what "JAFO" is:</i>

853
01:15:06,961 --> 01:15:10,505
<i>"Just Another Fucking Observer."</i>

854
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:16,553
You're not supposed to be in there.
Get the fuck out!

855
01:15:19,891 --> 01:15:22,017
You talking to me, asshole?

856
01:15:58,012 --> 01:15:59,262
Damn. Murphy!

857
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:15,612
<i>This is Special Base.
Come in.</i>

858
01:16:22,036 --> 01:16:23,078
Shit!

859
01:16:26,249 --> 01:16:27,457
<i>Los Angeles mobile.</i>

860
01:16:27,667 --> 01:16:29,876
Mobile, listen. Get me KBLA-TV.

861
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:32,087
<i>That number's in your directory.</i>

862
01:16:32,338 --> 01:16:35,173
Don't give me static.
This is a police emergency.

863
01:16:35,383 --> 01:16:36,508
Get me KBLA now!

864
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:40,845
<i>Good afternoon, KBLA-TV.</i>

865
01:16:41,097 --> 01:16:43,932
<i>I want to speak to Mario Machado
or Alf Hewitt.</i>

866
01:16:44,141 --> 01:16:46,935
<i>They're out in the field.
Wanna leave a message?</i>

867
01:16:47,144 --> 01:16:49,562
Tell them
Officer Frank Murphy is calling.

868
01:16:49,814 --> 01:16:52,274
I'm sending them a package.
Do you read me?

869
01:16:52,483 --> 01:16:53,984
<i>That's Frank Astro?</i>

870
01:16:54,235 --> 01:16:56,861
No, Frank Murphy. Astro Division...

871
01:16:57,113 --> 01:16:59,572
...police emergency.
Got it, sweetheart?

872
01:17:00,074 --> 01:17:03,285
- Yeah, I got it.
- Okay. Mobile? Mobile?

873
01:17:03,494 --> 01:17:06,329
<i>- Los Angeles mobile.
- Listen, I need another number.</i>

874
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:12,294
<i>- Hello?
- Kate, it's Frank.</i>

875
01:17:12,503 --> 01:17:14,504
Where are you?
I've been worried sick.

876
01:17:14,714 --> 01:17:17,966
I'm okay. Do me a favor
and pick up a package for me.

877
01:17:18,217 --> 01:17:21,469
<i>It's in a drive-in at the corner
of Victory and Riverside.</i>

878
01:17:21,721 --> 01:17:24,389
<i>It's near the concession stand,
in a dumpster.</i>

879
01:17:24,598 --> 01:17:27,350
- And then what?
- Take it to KBLA-TV.

880
01:17:27,518 --> 01:17:29,477
To Mario Machado or Alf Hewitt.

881
01:17:29,687 --> 01:17:32,731
<i>- Don't stop for anything or anybody.
- Got it.</i>

882
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:35,066
<i>- Okay. Thank you, baby.
- Bye.</i>

883
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:44,159
Where is he now?

884
01:17:44,368 --> 01:17:47,162
Over the Hollywood
and Ventura Freeway interchange.

885
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:50,248
Get the mayor's office on the phone.

886
01:17:50,458 --> 01:17:52,792
We're gonna get the Air Force,
and now!

887
01:17:53,044 --> 01:17:57,756
He called Channel 8 first.
The second call was to his girlfriend.

888
01:17:57,965 --> 01:18:02,385
Forget about the police. Get our own
cars to her place and that TV station!

889
01:18:02,636 --> 01:18:04,637
The bastard wants to go public!

890
01:18:04,889 --> 01:18:06,973
- We'll stop that.
- We'd better!

891
01:19:29,473 --> 01:19:31,141
Come on, move out!

892
01:19:33,644 --> 01:19:34,769
Move, move!

893
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:31,951
- Damn it, I can't see nothing!
- There she goes!

894
01:21:38,477 --> 01:21:44,315
<i>Air-7 to Special One.</i>

895
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,904
No shit, pendejo!

896
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:51,948
Set that thing down, man.

897
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:54,867
We got two choppers full
of SWAT guys.

898
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:01,416
It's getting real cozy up here.

899
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:04,210
<i>Return to base
or we're gonna open fire.</i>

900
01:22:08,299 --> 01:22:10,216
Come on, will you, Murphy?

901
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:14,846
All right, knock him down.

902
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:23,271
Okay, amigo. How's
your auto-rotation technique?

903
01:22:27,526 --> 01:22:28,526
Son of a bitch!

904
01:22:41,332 --> 01:22:42,498
Damn it! Hang on!

905
01:22:46,629 --> 01:22:48,004
Sorry about that, my friend.

906
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:00,975
Not again!

907
01:23:01,185 --> 01:23:04,520
All right, chaps.
How'd you like to follow my leader?

908
01:24:33,652 --> 01:24:34,902
- Pull up now!
- Pull up!

909
01:25:23,076 --> 01:25:25,036
<i>Okay, lady! Pull over!</i>

910
01:25:36,423 --> 01:25:37,840
Is there a problem, officer?

911
01:25:38,091 --> 01:25:39,926
A den mother in a Vega, right?

912
01:25:40,177 --> 01:25:44,472
Now play it very cool. I need
your license and your registration.

913
01:25:44,681 --> 01:25:45,681
Sure.

914
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:54,315
- I think I left them-
- Get out of the car.

915
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:08,055
<i>Channel 8 is bringing you live
coverage of a helicopter hijacking.</i>

916
01:27:08,432 --> 01:27:12,393
<i>Stay inside your homes.
There's a sniper over Los Angeles.</i>

917
01:27:12,644 --> 01:27:15,771
<i>We've already lost one police car
and two helicopters.</i>

918
01:27:16,023 --> 01:27:18,024
Well, what now, gentlemen?

919
01:27:18,275 --> 01:27:20,484
I don't plan on losing
more helicopters.

920
01:27:20,736 --> 01:27:23,154
May I introduce Colonel Coe
of the Air Force?

921
01:27:23,322 --> 01:27:24,488
- Colonel.
Mr. Mayor.

922
01:27:24,656 --> 01:27:27,241
A couple of F-16s are standing by
at March Field.

923
01:27:27,492 --> 01:27:29,368
- F-16s?
- We can take him out now.

924
01:27:29,828 --> 01:27:34,332
- All you've got to do is say the word.
- The F-16 is armed with rockets.

925
01:27:34,583 --> 01:27:37,752
The potential destruction
of innocent life is unimaginable.

926
01:27:38,003 --> 01:27:40,588
The F-16 is armed
with heat-seeking missiles.

927
01:27:40,839 --> 01:27:43,215
We can surgically remove him.
Like a tumor.

928
01:27:43,467 --> 01:27:45,384
We're not talking about a tumor.

929
01:27:52,976 --> 01:27:54,977
You gotta make a right there!

930
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:01,025
No, Kate.

931
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:18,542
You're really riding with the angels,
sweetheart.

932
01:28:47,406 --> 01:28:49,699
Thattagirl.
Good work!

933
01:29:05,132 --> 01:29:10,136
Ray Icelan at Astro says they've
scrambled two F-16s out of March.

934
01:29:10,387 --> 01:29:12,847
- What about the tape?
- No sign of it.

935
01:29:13,098 --> 01:29:16,308
But he called KBLA.
Fletcher's there to intercept.

936
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,811
I'll take care
of you one at a time.

937
01:29:19,062 --> 01:29:22,231
We'll have more help down here.
Just be calm.

938
01:29:22,691 --> 01:29:27,278
Sir! Sir! I've got to give this tape
to Mr. Machado or Abe Hewitt.

939
01:29:27,529 --> 01:29:31,240
- They're very busy right now.
- Yes, but this is from Frank Murphy.

940
01:29:31,491 --> 01:29:35,619
There's a crazy man in a helicopter.
I'll tell somebody you're here.

941
01:29:35,871 --> 01:29:38,706
The most dangerous thing
is a man afraid for his job.

942
01:29:38,957 --> 01:29:42,460
I'm Dick Fisher.
I'll get that to Mario if you'd like.

943
01:29:43,045 --> 01:29:45,171
No, I have to give this to
Mr. Mocher or-

944
01:29:45,422 --> 01:29:46,672
Machado.

945
01:29:46,923 --> 01:29:50,384
I'm his producer. I'd be delighted
to bring it up to him.

946
01:29:51,053 --> 01:29:52,136
I don't think so.

947
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:55,097
Can't we erase it?
Isn't that what the bug's for?

948
01:29:55,348 --> 01:29:57,391
We don't know the code number.

949
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:00,603
Then erase them all.

950
01:30:00,812 --> 01:30:05,441
- Why don't you give it to me-?
- Frank said to give it to Mr. Hewitt-

951
01:30:05,692 --> 01:30:09,278
I'm Alf Hewitt. You're the lady
with the tape from Frank Murphy?

952
01:30:09,529 --> 01:30:11,280
Your producer said that Mr. - 

953
01:30:11,531 --> 01:30:15,743
Who? I never saw this guy before
in my life. Come on, let's go.

954
01:30:15,994 --> 01:30:18,329
Not so fast.
That's government property.

955
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:21,248
- Get your hands off me!
- Stop him!

956
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:24,293
Get this bastard off me!

957
01:30:25,462 --> 01:30:27,546
Son of a bitch!
I'll blow your head off!

958
01:30:29,508 --> 01:30:31,717
Go, go, go! I got the tape!

959
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:01,539
<i>March Control,
this is Little Brother One.</i>

960
01:31:01,790 --> 01:31:06,168
<i>We have your target bearing 121
at 13 miles.</i>

961
01:31:06,419 --> 01:31:08,462
<i>Request clearance to engage.
Over.</i>

962
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:12,800
<i>Roger, Little Brother.
This is March Control.</i>

963
01:31:13,051 --> 01:31:15,344
<i>Affirmative.
Engage and destroy.</i>

964
01:31:15,929 --> 01:31:18,222
<i>I repeat:
Engage and destroy.</i>

965
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:32,987
<i>There he is.
He's all yours, cookie.</i>

966
01:32:35,967 --> 01:32:37,676
Holy shit!

967
01:32:50,899 --> 01:32:51,982
What?

968
01:32:54,110 --> 01:32:55,527
Well, I'll be damned.

969
01:32:56,863 --> 01:33:01,200
One of your missiles just took out
a barbeque shack down in Little Tokyo.

970
01:33:01,409 --> 01:33:04,787
- Francis, isn't that Ray's district?
- Yes, it is.

971
01:33:05,038 --> 01:33:06,205
You have his number?

972
01:33:06,414 --> 01:33:09,541
Call him, or they'll call him
and he'll call us...

973
01:33:09,793 --> 01:33:11,418
I'm on my way!

974
01:33:51,209 --> 01:33:53,127
There he is, right there!

975
01:33:56,715 --> 01:33:58,757
All right, everybody,
this is an emergency!

976
01:33:59,009 --> 01:34:01,802
<i>- All right, clear the area.
- Clear the area!</i>

977
01:34:08,018 --> 01:34:09,601
<i>Well, what do you know!</i>

978
01:34:10,103 --> 01:34:11,312
<i>He froze.</i>

979
01:34:12,605 --> 01:34:15,316
<i>Okay, he's all mine now, Cookie.</i>

980
01:34:45,221 --> 01:34:46,764
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

981
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:12,373
<i>I'm hit, cookie!
I'm hit!</i>

982
01:35:12,624 --> 01:35:14,208
<i>He blew my goddamn wing off!</i>

983
01:35:14,876 --> 01:35:16,126
<i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

984
01:35:16,378 --> 01:35:19,171
<i>This is Little Brother One.
I'm ejecting!</i>

985
01:35:55,917 --> 01:35:59,628
We just lost an F-16 and the top
of the Arco Tower. Now what?

986
01:35:59,879 --> 01:36:01,672
That's it. Call it off.

987
01:36:01,881 --> 01:36:06,176
May I remind you there is a crazy man
up there with six 20 mm cannons?

988
01:36:06,386 --> 01:36:07,678
I said, call it off.

989
01:36:08,346 --> 01:36:10,389
<i>Request permission for takeoff.</i>

990
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:13,809
<i>Colonel, hold your position.
Operation canceled.</i>

991
01:36:14,102 --> 01:36:17,938
<i>Repeat: Hold your position.
Do not take off.</i>

992
01:37:53,201 --> 01:37:54,201
Back to base.

993
01:38:06,172 --> 01:38:09,675
<i>Rough her up? Is that a
euphemism for "assassination"?</i>

994
01:38:09,926 --> 01:38:15,055
<i>She had street informants, and she'd
connected our project to the trouble-</i>

995
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:17,474
Jesus, Lollie,
you ought to hear this stuff.

996
01:38:17,725 --> 01:38:19,768
They sound like cops and feds.

997
01:38:20,019 --> 01:38:24,106
They're stirring up the barrio
to prove what that chopper can do.

998
01:38:25,316 --> 01:38:28,193
Tell Mario to go easy
on that "mad-sniper" stuff.

999
01:38:28,403 --> 01:38:31,863
That cop may be the hottest
ticket since Horatius at the bridge.

1000
01:39:42,018 --> 01:39:43,810
All right, let's try this.

1001
01:40:40,618 --> 01:40:42,494
All right, where are you?

1002
01:41:17,572 --> 01:41:19,156
Oh, damn it!

1003
01:42:02,033 --> 01:42:06,328
All right, Murphy. It's about time you
put your money where your mouth is.

1004
01:42:16,130 --> 01:42:18,131
One, two...

1005
01:42:18,341 --> 01:42:19,382
...three!

1006
01:42:35,775 --> 01:42:38,151
Come on, you tub of shit!

1007
01:42:49,121 --> 01:42:50,622
That's impossible!

1008
01:43:08,349 --> 01:43:09,349
Catch you later.

1009
01:44:01,152 --> 01:44:04,654
Okay. And now it's your turn.

1010
01:44:58,376 --> 01:45:03,505
<i>The $5 million prototype was destroyed
when Officer Murphy, out of gas...</i>

1011
01:45:03,839 --> 01:45:08,426
<i>... set the helicopter down on the
tracks in front of a freight train.</i>

1012
01:45:08,678 --> 01:45:11,972
<i>That was the end of the helicopter,
but not of this story.</i>

1013
01:45:12,223 --> 01:45:16,226
<i>On the strength of a tape that
Murphy delivered to this reporter...</i>

1014
01:45:16,477 --> 01:45:21,147
<i>... the mayor's reopened the
investigation of McNeely's death...</i>

1015
01:45:21,399 --> 01:45:26,403
<i>... which might also be connected
with the death of Officer Lymangood.</i>

1016
01:45:26,654 --> 01:45:29,030
<i>Half a dozen local police officers...</i>

1017
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:33,118
<i>... and several officials of the
State and Justice departments...</i>

1018
01:45:33,369 --> 01:45:35,286
<i>... have been detained for questioning.</i>

1019
01:45:35,496 --> 01:45:36,788
<i>Coming up, weather...</i>

1020
01:45:37,039 --> 01:45:40,917
<i>... and a preview of a bullet train
soon to be seen in the Southland.</i>

1021
01:45:41,127 --> 01:45:42,293
<i>Maybe.</i>

1022
01:45:43,305 --> 01:45:49,337
