00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,556
There comes a time in your life
when everything falls into place.

3
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,513
That dream, you've been working
towards for years.

4
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,555
You've torn your knees for it
on the dance floor.

5
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,518
You gave up everything else for it.

6
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,798
You kept going until
you really couldn't anymore.

7
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,192
There comes a time when every dance
you ever danced counts.

8
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,153
When you can feel every step,
every flow, every move...

9
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,392
in the deepest fibers of your body.

10
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,909
That's the time when you know
you don't live to dance...

11
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,913
but that you dance to live.

12
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,190
That time is now.

13
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,638
There's news.

14
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,116
Stop. Please stop, sir.

15
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:45,030
Chanel, I'm really late. I had to work
overtime, and I missed the bus.

16
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,557
Can you please pick me up?
- You have to learn to fend for yourself.

17
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,032
I've got a job, okay? If my daddy
worked for me, I could manage.

18
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,156
Byeee.

19
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,915
Is that Tara?
- Don't answer it. Go.

20
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,152
I'm with them. I'm one of the dancers.

21
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,430
Thank you, ladies.

22
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,112
Where were you?
- Ladies, you were really awesome.

23
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,989
I think you deserve a drink. Or ten.

24
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,119
Which of you girls can sign this?
Here, please.

25
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,513
Thank you. Here you go.
You'll split it with your friends, right?

26
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,513
Mail?
- Yes, upstairs.

27
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,040
Samuel, what are you doing here?

28
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,990
What are you doing?

29
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,317
Honey...
- I'm going to New York.

30
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,313
Oh yes, by the way. It's over.

31
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,551
In the Battle of Broadway
the five best Dutch dance crews...

32
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,075
will compete for a special award.

33
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,951
The grant for the trip is still uncertain,
because of cutbacks.

34
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,160
Do you remember how he danced?

35
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,118
How he looked at one spectator?
- At me.

36
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,670
And that sparks would fly
when he danced.

37
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,389
He was a tiger. Just like his son.

38
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,516
Maybe I'll find him.

39
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,513
Listen.

40
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,672
You're going to New York
to win that contest.

41
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,868
Not to find someone who's got nothing
to do with you anymore. Okay?

42
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,031
Just forget it.

43
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,713
Forget it.

44
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,838
Brainpower's new single, Light It Up.

45
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,591
Four tens, home boy.
- Great.

46
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,309
Cool track.
- No, man. I don't like hip-hop.

47
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,359
It's Brainpower.
- Listen, dude. This is real music.

48
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,676
Have a good trip, my man.

49
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,393
I came by your place.
- Don't ask.

50
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,308
Hey, I'm sorry, man. Ray...
- Quincy.

51
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,798
It's been a long time.

52
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,635
Are you in the contest?
- You know I am.

53
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,874
You know what that means, don't you?
- That you're going to lose, right?

54
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,469
You're good at that.
- Contestants, please report.

55
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,679
So many women, so little time.
- See you later, okay?

56
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,314
I'd like to get to know you...

57
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,439
Be careful.
- Hang on. Let me.

58
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,551
Give it to me.

59
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,588
You're going to New York too?
- No, I'm waiting for a ferry boat here.

60
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,075
Oh, my God. Look at Tara
in her new outfit.

61
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,790
Is that a real one?

62
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,916
Your ticket.
- Thanks.

63
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,399
Still no payment for the video.
- They'd pay cash, right?

64
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,949
Do you have it?
- No, do you?

65
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:34,559
We're not completely sure why, but it
seems our grant has been canceled.

66
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,073
And...

67
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,315
the whole thing's been called off.

68
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,680
Well, that's it, then.

69
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,118
That's it, then? We've got tickets,
don't we? Dumbo?

70
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,750
What will you do there?
- What do you think?

71
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,874
Who's going to New York with me?

72
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,833
Well?

73
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,676
Forty dancers in that hall,
and you're coming along.

74
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,592
Do you know each other?

75
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,273
Sure we do.
- No.

76
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,036
What's the plan?
- The plane's going to New York.

77
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,829
And if you don't push the stop button,
so are we.

78
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,278
The two of us, for a week...
- To win that contest, yes.

79
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,230
Fortunately for you, you're with one
of Holland's biggest talents.

80
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,470
And what's his name?

81
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:24,031
Very funny. My crew won everything
in the Amsterdam area.

82
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,590
And is your crew on the plane as well?

83
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,557
Is yours?

84
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,869
Well. One, two, three, four.

85
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,753
Five.

86
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,511
Look at that. Paris Hilton's coming too.

87
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,478
Five dancers.
Sounds like a crew to me.

88
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,677
You think we could, guys?
- Why not?

89
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,639
We don't know each other.
- They don't know that in New York.

90
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,189
If we arrive as one crew, we're in.

91
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:07,673
Yes, and we'll win that shit,
and be on Broadway, baby.

92
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,558
Or won't we?

93
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,235
Be like that.
- She's your type.

94
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,709
I'm going to nail her.

95
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,677
We're approaching New York Airport,
JFK.

96
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,877
The Fasten Your Seatbelts sign
has been lit.

97
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,552
Hey. The 34 bus will take us straight
to the Dance Academy.

98
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,678
I don't do buses.
- Excuse me?

99
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,798
I don't do buses.
- She doesn't do buses.

100
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,076
Not even with a condom?

101
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,748
Check that chick, man.
Did you see that?

102
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,197
Yes, Daddy.

103
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,309
Don't think I'm going to breakdance.
- Because?

104
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,271
If I enjoyed mopping the floor
in my tracksuit, I'd be a cleaning lady.

105
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,233
Wow. Check this out.

106
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,313
Can we do this?
- Sure. It's crap that everything's full.

107
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,439
Sometimes you just have to be
assertive.

108
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,160
I can't wait to see this.

109
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,911
You got a problem?

110
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,992
Smart move.

111
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:08,518
I know you from somewhere. Since
when do you dance with the Spanish?

112
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,630
So you don't qualify.

113
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,713
We're going to have a coffee break.

114
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,158
Those morons.
- Don't get worked up.

115
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,232
I'm not. Didn't you see
what that guy did?

116
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,119
Yes. Dance better than you.
- Fuck you.

117
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,556
What was that?
- She's right, though.

118
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,714
We hardly know each other. We have
different styles, and no routine.

119
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,516
What are we doing here?

120
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,712
Wait.

121
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,270
Excuse me?
- Sorry, but I don't do bad hotels.

122
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,356
But this isn't a bad hotel.
It's a perfect hotel.

123
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,512
Yes. You can even rent rooms
by the hour.

124
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,475
Oh, yuck. By the hour...

125
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,712
Fortunately, you only need
five minutes.

126
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,878
You know, guys? Good luck. We'll call.

127
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,753
Bye.

128
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,752
What are you doing here?
- It was open.

129
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,832
You can't just walk in.
- I wanted Samuel.

130
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,798
He's not here. Go.
- Have you seen Ray?

131
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,953
He's not in my shower either. Go away.
- Just tell me...

132
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,111
No. Go away.

133
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,597
Did you forget something?

134
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,079
Moron.

135
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,959
Damn, Tara. Where were you?
- Just around.

136
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,157
Wow. That's bad, Mama.

137
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,595
See? We're good. We can win.
- You'd say so, yes.

138
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,716
With these skills?

139
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,072
Not.

140
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,913
Awesome. Catch you later.

141
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,072
Was that the look of love?
- You wish.

142
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,599
I promise. We'll do something nice
tonight.

143
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,756
Here's some money.

144
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,309
You'll be alright, won't you?

145
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,718
That was good.
- Hey, you're Dutch?

146
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,795
Yes, we arrived yesterday.
- How do you do that with your foot...

147
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,396
Wait, I can show you.
You lean on this arm...

148
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,516
Like this, you mean?

149
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,038
Just you wait.

150
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,517
Ray, your bag.

151
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,876
Not the bag, not the bag...

152
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,595
That's my father. He lives here as well.

153
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,877
Were you going to see him?

154
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,952
Okay, cool. I'm coming with you.

155
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:29,915
Sure. You can't let a ten-year-old kid
alone in a city like New York, can you?

156
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,672
Wise guy.

157
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:45,874
Seeing those guys at the Academy,
I really think we have to be creative.

158
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,749
I've got a fun idea, let's try it.
Here, for you.

159
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,276
A blue one for you. Samuel.

160
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,591
Sorry Tara, I don't have a pink one
for you.

161
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:32,038
Guys, let's get serious. If we want to
win that battle, we have to try harder.

162
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,550
It's a small world, isn't it.

163
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,678
Come on, Nina.

164
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,151
That's nice.

165
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,959
Come on, Ray.

166
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,597
Come on, Quincy.

167
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,917
Finish her, man.

168
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,433
Okay, Samuel. Get him.

169
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,193
Ramona. Met her in the park
this morning.

170
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,352
I really have to get up earlier.

171
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,715
That's right. To practice.

172
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,997
This really won't happen to us again.

173
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,390
Is that clear?
- Crackers.

174
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,468
How do you know he still dances here?
That picture's old.

175
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,074
Yes, but this is him.

176
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,350
They'll be open tomorrow.

177
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,519
Are your parents divorced?
Because they don't talk.

178
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,877
Mine are divorced.
- Mine aren't.

179
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:59,149
They were never married. My dad
had to go back, after a dance contest.

180
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,392
I got it from him. The dancing.

181
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,312
Here, look at this.

182
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,596
I made this for him.

183
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,633
Is that you?
- Yes, and this. It's all me, actually.

184
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,475
Here, a battle. So he can see
I've got his talent.

185
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,200
He can see all this tomorrow.

186
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,349
What are you doing?
- I'm thinking.

187
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,996
We need something
no one has ever seen before. Ever.

188
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,714
That means you keep your shirt on,
Casanova.

189
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,873
But think about what we did yesterday,
at the club.

190
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:55,716
All together, and yet...
- No. I'll work it out in my room.

191
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,357
See you later.

192
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,712
Gross.
- Relax. Breathe in, breathe out.

193
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,757
And no one's using this?

194
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,598
Right, this doesn't really work.

195
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,433
Let's try something else.

196
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:40,230
The theme's Broadway,
so I want to use that.

197
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,678
Ray and Samuel...
Samuel, pay attention, please.

198
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,239
I want you to lift me.

199
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:52,032
I know it sounds vague, but I'm
wearing a hat. And you make it float.

200
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,676
Please.

201
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,035
Okay, the lift...

202
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,112
And Tara?
- I'll be with you in a minute.

203
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:07,673
It's 5, 6, 7, 8, then two bars,
then we do the lift. You're on this side.

204
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,796
After that, we do the hat.

205
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,394
5, 6, 7, 8, lift me up.

206
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,437
Okay, wait, wait.

207
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:21,278
We've got two bars to do the lift.
5, 6, 7, 8, and then I'll count, one, two.

208
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,398
Is that clear? One more time.

209
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,030
Five... Samuel, please. I'm over here.

210
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,954
God damn it. Think, guys.
- Come on, Nina.

211
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:40,272
This won't work.
- We're creating, that's how it goes.

212
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,795
But shouldn't I...
- No.

213
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,599
What about me?
- Definitely not you.

214
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,590
Nina, come on.

215
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,709
Daddy, you're going to party.

216
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,275
Act normal. I can't do salsa.

217
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,831
Dude, you just said 'great'.
- You'd have said the same thing.

218
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,909
You can dance salsa, right?

219
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,995
Get away from me, man.

220
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,192
Those guys are bad.
- Be cool, man.

221
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,191
Right. You can do that.

222
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,635
You know, if I created our routine, I'd...

223
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,837
But you're not creating it. I am.

224
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,389
You just decided that, did you?

225
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:50,111
We have to be good in that battle.
And you're just screwing around.

226
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:55,070
That's right. Running around,
going to parties...

227
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:58,755
pulling chicks...
- Come on. Listen to her.

228
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:03,277
Like I said, if I were creating
the routine...

229
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,159
I'd draw inspiration from this.

230
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:10,359
Inspiration?
- Yes. For new moves.

231
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:15,958
I'm sorry, but if I want to see some new
moves, I'll watch the porn channel.

232
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,275
Come on then, you hot babe.

233
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:32,910
So, as I was saying...

234
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,196
different moves.

235
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:39,239
That's not a routine yet.
- No, but it's something.

236
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,752
Are you coming? Stud?

237
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,114
Can I have my phone?
- Here it is.

238
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:23,716
It's late. I wanted an early night.
- Don't be that way.

239
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,877
What about this?
- You drink it.

240
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:37,836
What are you doing?
- Such a great party.

241
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,678
Oh man, you've got a big nose.

242
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,396
Hey, look at this.

243
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,195
Sit down and stay down.

244
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:12,028
Look, I can do that too.

245
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:48,396
I want to go home.

246
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,077
Thanks a lot, dude.

247
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:49,432
I told you you'd fall in love with me.

248
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,231
Nice, thanks.

249
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:01,915
Let's go to the Cielo
to dance off the tension.

250
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:04,913
No, we've got loads to do yet.

251
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:09,198
We'll have dinner,
then we'll dance until it gets light.

252
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,710
Didn't you hear me?

253
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:15,877
We have to focus.

254
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:19,669
Look. This is what I wanted to do.

255
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:23,549
I changed the entire composition...

256
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:27,474
I've only got tonight to work this out.

257
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:32,077
Come on. I just want to have fun.
- Fun?

258
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:38,793
Going home with my tail between
my legs because I lost, that'll be fun.

259
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:42,236
If I go home without winning,
I'll have failed.

260
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,789
And when you go home...

261
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:49,511
you'll have a good story, a nice trip
and some pretty chicks.

262
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,398
I just mean...

263
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,475
this is the chance I've waited for
all my life.

264
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:00,428
And you've achieved much more
than you ever expected.

265
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,477
Are you serious?

266
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:35,318
Which one do you think it is?

267
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,438
That one.

268
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,955
It could be him as well.

269
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,639
You wait here.
- Okay, chill.

270
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:48,551
Ray, your father. Did you find him?

271
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:05,793
I just want this to work.

272
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:07,951
Do you understand?

273
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,997
Isn't Quincy here?
- How should I know?

274
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:30,872
Come on, you don't need to do this.

275
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,872
This?

276
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:37,156
Oh, you think I...

277
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:41,154
I was just visiting a girl I met.
- I saw you dance.

278
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:46,753
All those clothes, the taxis, the hotel...

279
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:49,673
Is that worth all this nonsense?

280
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:53,879
Acting like a whore to pay for it?
- A whore?

281
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:57,669
I'm not a fucking whore, alright?

282
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:04,392
I just want to say you shouldn't do this.

283
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:09,429
I don't care what you think.
I'll never go back to how it used to be.

284
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:13,149
'If you can't afford it,
you shouldn't want it.'

285
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:16,995
No. And you keep your mouth shut,
you hear me?

286
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:31,909
Come on, Tara, listen to me.
- You heard me.

287
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:37,792
Come with me. Trust me.

288
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:49,952
Now you. Here we go.
One, two, three, four, five, six...

289
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,877
Come on, Tara...

290
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,910
I mean well.

291
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,756
Come with me.

292
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:13,631
Tara, please work at it.
The battle's tomorrow.

293
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:15,552
Keep going.

294
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:20,150
Ray, where's your head at? Damn...
- Wait.

295
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,675
What are you doing? Chill out.

296
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:25,434
No chilling out. It has to be good.

297
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:28,956
It won't be good if...
- Because you can't do it.

298
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:34,277
Just do it for once, instead of moaning.

299
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:36,556
Moaner.
- Jesus.

300
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:40,109
Yeah, what?
- Nagging bitch.

301
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:42,157
Five minutes.

302
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:12,280
What is this?
- They're trying hard.

303
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:17,673
And you keep pushing them.
- They're not trying, you know that.

304
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:23,469
Where were you yesterday?
- What do you mean?

305
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:27,076
Where were you?
- What are you talking about?

306
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,750
You were with Tara.

307
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:39,119
What's going on with you, anyway?

308
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,794
Nina, there's nothing going on.

309
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:45,669
Is there anyone here
who came to dance?

310
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:49,992
Well? Does anyone really
want to do this battle?

311
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:54,438
You. All you do is hang out
with your girlfriend.

312
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:57,319
Yes, your girlfriend.

313
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:01,359
And Tara, I don't know why
you're here, but not to dance.

314
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:05,308
You're walking around
with Mini Michael. That sucks.

315
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:09,075
What are you doing?
- And you should really shut up.

316
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:11,800
You're only here for the women.

317
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:15,999
Well, you've had two. Congratulations.

318
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:28,991
I'm out.

319
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:36,638
Nina, wait.

320
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,872
Listen to me.
- What do you want?

321
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:42,554
Fuck this. I'm going.

322
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:46,512
You know...

323
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:51,628
That's what I mean.
- I can explain.

324
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:53,791
Leave me alone.

325
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:53,433
His dad worked all night long.

326
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:57,756
He was lying on the sidewalk.
- Great example.

327
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:03,757
Great example.

328
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:10,070
I'm sorry my mind was on other things.

329
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:13,915
I was looking for my father.
- And?

330
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:18,392
Did you find him?
- I thought I'd understand if I met him.

331
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:26,917
But I understand even less.
My mother lied about everything.

332
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:29,355
What do you mean?

333
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,159
My father's not a dancer at all.

334
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:38,035
Yes, but you did find him, didn't you?

335
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:50,439
Give me an hour, okay?
- Ray, come on.

336
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:53,956
The contest is today, man. Ray...

337
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:10,954
Where are you going?
- Just leaving.

338
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:14,829
But the contest?
- Nina's gone, Tara's gone.

339
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,309
Nina's gone?
- I saw her leave.

340
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:21,792
And you didn't tell me?
- I've got problems of my own. It's over.

341
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:58,838
Are you leaving?

342
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:06,998
Then why are you still here?
- As if I had a place to go.

343
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:09,435
I fought with everyone.

344
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:15,389
You think you have to do it
all by yourself. If you don't trust us...

345
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:17,994
nothing will ever happen.

346
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:20,628
What was going on with Tara?

347
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:29,034
She's dancing at a strip club.

348
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:32,670
To pay for all that nonsense.
- You're serious?

349
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:37,671
She's in even deeper shit than we are.

350
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:52,078
We have a dance contest to do.
- As if you still want to.

351
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:57,435
All you have to do is apologize.

352
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:00,673
Am I right?

353
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,672
I'm sorry.

354
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:47,157
I'm sorry, Tara.

355
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:51,836
That I've been such a bitch.
Come here.

356
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,434
It's okay.

357
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:56,989
I was a lot worse.

358
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:09,229
I hate to bug you, but if we want
to win that contest, we have to go.

359
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:12,278
Yes, let's go.
- The subway's this way.

360
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:16,319
Wait.
- Right. The lady doesn't do subways.

361
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:19,153
No, the subway's fine.

362
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:24,713
But the bus is quicker.
- Very sharp, Tara. Very sharp.

363
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:43,475
Oh, there's that guy again.

364
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:46,431
Just ignore him. Come on.

365
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:49,957
Sweet thing.

366
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:51,758
Moron.

367
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:05,478
Sit down.

368
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:11,390
Must have been slippery.

369
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,358
Are you okay?

370
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:19,717
Where does it hurt?
- It's my knee.

371
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:23,434
You have to go to the hospital.

372
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:26,160
Go ahead and dance.
- It's not worth it.

373
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:28,709
Just go and dance, okay?

374
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:09,038
Hey, kiddies.

375
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:12,716
Does your little knee hurt?

376
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,598
Don't do it, don't do it.

377
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:19,598
Think of your knee.

378
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:30,038
You can forget it.

379
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:04,073
When you arrive,
you often forget the journey.

380
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:05,958
The pain.

381
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:08,076
The injuries.

382
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:10,356
The sleepless nights.

383
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:12,988
The sacrifice.

384
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:16,789
All you remember is the highlights.

385
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:19,318
New York.

386
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:22,952
Together with you.

387
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:25,918
Hey guys, do you hear that?

388
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:34,717
They're calling us back to the stage.
Come on.

389
01:32:35,305 --> 01:32:41,773
