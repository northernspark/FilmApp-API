Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

2
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,623
All right, easy.

3
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,420
Lousy morning for it.

4
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,930
Mr. Andrew Marsh,
bagged and tagged.

5
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,330
Better him than us.

6
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,924
So what did him in?

7
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,971
Looks like cardiac arrest,
but l'll call you later.

8
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:58,643
-Mr. Garrett.
-Morning, sir.

9
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,276
l'll be outside.

10
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,512
Sir.

11
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,083
Lieutenant...

12
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:22,223
-Nice quality.
-Nice ass.

13
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:25,169
That was the tape in the VCR.
The power was still on.

14
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:27,967
The sucker had a heart attack
watching his home movies.

15
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,507
What do you need me for?

16
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:31,770
He was tied up.
l've heard remote, but--

17
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:34,244
What the hell is this?

18
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:37,647
That is a nipple clamp.

19
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,015
-How would you know?
-He's from L.A.

20
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:42,316
l just happen to be
a well-informed individual.

21
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,948
How does this thing work?

22
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,117
Who cares? Bag it.

23
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:48,626
This is kinky shit.

24
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:51,687
Harry, take a picture
of these gouges for me.

25
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:54,324
Looks like she had him
chewing on the wood.

26
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,131
No, it looks more like
she had him handcuffed.

27
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,398
Who found the body?

28
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:01,598
Secretary came by
to pick up some papers.

29
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,300
Hell of a shock.
Want to talk to her?

30
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,809
She wouldn't leave.
Thought we'd steal the silver.

31
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:08,073
Can you blame her?

32
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,713
Do you want me to identify her?

33
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:14,480
lt's Rebecca Carlson.

34
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,021
His girlfriend.

35
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,250
They had a date last night
according to Ms. Braslow.

36
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:19,882
This is Bob Garrett from
the District Attorney's office.

37
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,419
Ms. Braslow was Mr. Marsh's
secretary for six years.

38
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:26,829
She killed him.

39
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,268
You've got your first witness.

40
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:52,148
The Resurrection and the Life
will raise him up in glory.

41
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:56,821
Then may he see the light
of Your presence, Lord Jesus.

42
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:59,922
ln the name of the Father,
and of the Son...

43
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,900
and of the Holy Spirit, amen.

44
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,267
Bless this grave...

45
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:08,863
and send your angel
to watch over it.

46
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:13,537
Forgive the sins of our brother,
whose body we bury here.

47
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:16,081
We ask this
through Christ our Lord.

48
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,844
Amen.

49
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:21,114
Go in peace with Christ.
Thanks be to God.

50
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:40,005
Miss Carlson?

51
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:42,700
-l'm sorry l'm late.
-Frank Dulaney?

52
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,902
l look that much like a lawyer?

53
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,673
Who else would speak to me?

54
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,477
His friends think
l shouldn't even be here.

55
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,413
Will you represent me?

56
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:56,955
There haven't been
any charges filed against you.

57
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,048
But there will be.
You know that.

58
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:03,484
Do you think l killed him?

59
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:07,055
That's a question
l never ask my clients.

60
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:10,330
What matters is whether the
state can prove you killed him.

61
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:13,433
l loved Andrew.

62
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,940
Why is it so hard
for everybody to believe?

63
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:19,876
You know why.
You're young and beautiful...

64
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:22,938
and you were involved
with a wealthy older man.

65
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:25,609
He wasn't old to me.

66
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:28,483
l'm sorry l said that.

67
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,955
A big part of my life
has been taken away from me...

68
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:35,118
and people are saying
it was my fault.

69
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:38,129
They've taken something good
between two people in love...

70
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:40,461
and made it dirty.

71
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,467
l didn't kill him.

72
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,263
You believed her?

73
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,308
Actually, l did.

74
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,900
You're a romantic.

75
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:54,707
Not at all. l just know
bullshit when l hear it...

76
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,146
and this wasn't bullshit.

77
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:59,082
Sharon, how can you say
she didn't love him...

78
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,881
without having met
either one of them?

79
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:02,215
He was too old.

80
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:03,880
He's right.

81
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,924
That's a very narrow
view of love.

82
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:08,324
lt's what the jury will think.

83
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:10,328
Did he have any family?

84
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:13,194
Lots of wives, no kids.

85
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,666
The register broke down again.

86
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:18,727
lt's the register.
Going to be here a while?

87
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:19,964
No. We're going home.

88
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,630
l have to lock up tonight.

89
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:24,141
Why don't you hire a manager?

90
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,440
Because at least
l won't be stealing from myself.

91
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:29,310
Last time this week?

92
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,647
Want a kiss?

93
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:35,950
lt's OK. Nobody noticed.

94
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,455
Bye.

95
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:38,956
Bye-bye.

96
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:41,516
Jamie!
How'd you sneak past me?

97
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,118
l saw some friends.

98
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,663
Those are your friends?

99
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,197
These are my friends.

100
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,572
Can you really
screw someone to death?

101
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,774
No.

102
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:02,975
Besides, you don't have
to worry about that stuff yet.

103
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:05,779
Do you?

104
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,013
No.

105
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:11,750
Because
you are a good-looking guy.

106
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,086
Let's go.

107
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,471
OK, let's go.

108
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:31,108
The neighbors saw you go
into Marsh's house at 8:30.

109
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,838
She's not denying she was there.

110
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,436
Did you have sex with him?

111
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,572
Yes.

112
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,479
Did you handcuff him to the bed?

113
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,711
Don't tell me it's relevant,
Bobby.

114
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:40,911
You didn't have to answer that.

115
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:43,888
No, but we appreciate
her honesty and cooperation.

116
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:46,356
-Bullshit.
-When did you leave?

117
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:49,121
Around midnight, l suppose.

118
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,129
lf l had known
it was going to matter...

119
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,131
l would've paid more attention.

120
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,359
Well, it's true, Frank.

121
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,025
There's nothing wrong
with saying that.

122
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:59,469
Miss Carlson,
do you use cocaine?

123
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:03,099
Cocaine use is illegal
in the state of Oregon.

124
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,906
l've never used it in Oregon.

125
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,875
Can we move on, please?

126
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,648
Did Mr. Marsh use cocaine?

127
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,985
Never.

128
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:23,017
The toxicology tests
came back positive for cocaine.

129
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:25,563
Then it's false positive,
because we never did drugs.

130
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:26,962
Not even poppers?

131
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,228
She just said
they didn't use drugs.

132
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:32,999
Amyl nitrate is often available
to heart patients.

133
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:36,074
Were you aware of
Mr. Marsh's heart condition?

134
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:39,269
He had arrhythmia.
That's not a heart condition.

135
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:43,645
Mr. Marsh had an advanced case
of heart disease.

136
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:47,849
He said it wasn't serious.

137
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,117
Why would he lie to you
about it?

138
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,453
l never know why men lie.

139
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,620
They just do.

140
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,596
Men lie.

141
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,092
Would you describe yourself
as a dominatrix?

142
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,762
Back off of this, Bob.

143
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,361
-A sadomasochist?
-That's it.

144
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:10,704
lnterview's over. Let's go.

145
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,677
You want to charge her?
Go ahead.

146
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:16,715
Otherwise, you can reach
Miss Carlson through my office.

147
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,249
Fine.

148
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:21,013
But l don't think
that'll be necessary.

149
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,521
-Reese.
-Right.

150
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:25,079
Rebecca Carlson...

151
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,591
you're under arrest
for the murder of Andrew Marsh.

152
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,184
You have the right
to remain silent.

153
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:31,195
Anything you say can
and will be used against you...

154
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:32,423
in a court of law.

155
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:35,399
Rebecca, l'll have you out
as fast as l can.

156
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,698
...one will be appointed
to you by the state.

157
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,738
Trying to get your name
on the front page?

158
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,744
You fucking sandbagged me!

159
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:50,043
Jesus, Frank,
don't take it personal.

160
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,880
Spending too much time with
criminals affects your judgment.

161
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:55,352
-You don't have probable cause.
-Sure, l do.

162
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:58,083
Marsh's will leaves
all $8 million to your client...

163
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,182
which would've
given even me motive...

164
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,887
and she admits to being there
the night of the murder.

165
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,589
You don't know it was homicide.

166
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,393
The method's self-explanatory.

167
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:07,397
What are you going to do?

168
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:08,956
Tag the body
as the murder weapon?

169
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,059
Exhibit ''A''?

170
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,626
lt's not a crime
to be a great lay.

171
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,638
Sure. l'd have
to have myself indicted.

172
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:15,833
This case is ridiculous.

173
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,772
Drop the charges,
save the state some money.

174
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,174
You can't convict.

175
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:22,976
Cocaine slipped to a rich old
man dying of heart disease?

176
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,880
l think l can make that case.

177
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,110
Not without intent.

178
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,618
She'll get manslaughter.

179
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,621
Tell your client 20 years.

180
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,452
Seven, if she behaves.

181
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:37,823
There they are.

182
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,745
Did you do it, Miss Carlson?

183
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:05,490
Get me out of here.

184
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,636
Bobby Garrett's going to stage
a big ugly trial.

185
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,671
Does he really expect me
to plead guilty...

186
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,173
to spare myself
the embarrassment?

187
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,004
l'm not guilty.

188
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,839
l'm not going to plead guilty.

189
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,106
l'd feel better
if you weren't in the will.

190
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:33,015
Andrew put me in his will?

191
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,178
Don't start jerking me around.

192
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,222
You're the primary beneficiary.

193
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:38,813
How much?

194
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,190
Wouldn't you ask?

195
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,665
Come on, how much?

196
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:50,065
Eight million, give or take.

197
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:53,804
That's a hell of a motive.

198
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:56,467
l know how Bobby works.

199
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:58,873
He's going to build his case
on your sex life.

200
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:02,380
He'll drag out every dirty
little thing you did.

201
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,608
lt wasn't dirty.

202
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:06,276
Not to you. Not to Andrew.

203
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:09,810
But people here have very
conservative views about sex.

204
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,220
No, they don't.

205
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,224
They just don't talk about it.

206
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,953
They're such hypocrites.

207
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:18,724
Those hypocrites will be
sitting in the jury box...

208
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,995
listening to Garrett say how
you led Andrew into perversion.

209
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,001
l didn't have
to lead him anywhere.

210
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:27,038
Andrew knew
exactly what he wanted.

211
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,775
All we did was make love.

212
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,276
ln handcuffs.

213
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:35,973
lt was different,
but it was still making love.

214
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:43,450
Have you ever seen animals
make love, Frank?

215
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:47,955
lt's intense.

216
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,461
lt's violent.

217
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:53,123
But they never
really hurt each other.

218
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,133
We're not animals.

219
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,169
Yes, we are.

220
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,436
You're great
when you get a big case.

221
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:43,443
How about the rest of the time?

222
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:45,483
You know what l mean.

223
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,160
l have to take a shower.

224
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:15,845
You don't get as rich as Marsh
by being a nice guy.

225
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,849
l want you to find out
who he fucked over--

226
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,612
business, personal, social--

227
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,619
anyone who might want him dead.

228
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,120
l'm hitting all the dealers...

229
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:25,122
with a list of
their nearest and dearest.

230
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,124
Maybe we'll get lucky
and come up with a user.

231
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:30,958
Joanne Braslow is here.
Garrett brought doughnuts.

232
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,691
The man's considerate.

233
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,233
But he always eats them all.

234
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,702
lt wasn't normal.

235
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:40,669
They didn't have normal sex.

236
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:43,674
How do you know
what kind of sex they had?

237
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,505
l wasn't peeping
through the keyhole...

238
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:47,340
if that's
what you're implying.

239
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:50,814
l would go to the house to
pick up and drop off papers...

240
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:54,011
and l would find
their little toys all over.

241
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:55,314
Would you characterize...

242
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:58,515
your feelings toward
my client as negative?

243
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,990
l don't have much sympathy
for drug users.

244
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:06,662
Do you have personal knowledge
that she used drugs?

245
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:14,568
l personally saw her
shovel the stuff up her nose.

246
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:15,799
ls that good enough?

247
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,432
ln front of a secretary?

248
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,477
l was at the house one morning.

249
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,479
l thought
she was still upstairs with him.

250
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:23,481
l went into the powder room...

251
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:26,814
and she was spooning coke
from a little vial.

252
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:28,512
What did she say
when she saw you?

253
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,817
She was too busy to notice.

254
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:33,824
Did you tell your boss
what you had seen?

255
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:36,690
-No.
-And why not?

256
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:39,196
l wanted to keep my job.

257
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:40,754
That didn't include
telling him...

258
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,028
his girlfriend
was a cokehead slut.

259
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:46,703
Frank...

260
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,938
take the last doughnut.

261
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:04,086
You fucking lied to me.
You lied on tape.

262
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:06,021
You were asked
a direct question--

263
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:07,456
''Do you use cocaine?''

264
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,652
And l said no.

265
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,592
Now they've
got an eyewitness...

266
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:13,096
that can testify not only
do you use cocaine...

267
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:15,565
but you used cocaine
in Marsh's house.

268
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:16,726
Joanne's lying.

269
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:18,895
l didn't say it was Joanne.

270
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:20,995
Who else would have been
in the house?

271
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:23,165
Do you know the expression
''smoking gun''?

272
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,641
She was in love with him.

273
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,973
Don't you see that?

274
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,843
Andrew Marsh must've been
a goddamn lovable guy.

275
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:30,814
Everybody loved him !

276
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,147
l haven't touched coke
since l was 17.

277
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,413
She makes a good witness.

278
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,148
l want you to meet somebody.

279
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,526
lt's right over here.

280
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,241
Dr. Novaro?

281
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,841
Ah, Miss Carlson.
l've been waiting for you.

282
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:02,846
Sorry l'm late.

283
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,112
This is Frank Dulaney.
He's my lawyer.

284
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,915
-Could you give me my medicine?
-Certainly.

285
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,130
There you are.

286
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,302
Go ahead.

287
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,100
You got to be kidding.

288
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:29,731
lnvestigate.

289
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,017
What the hell is it?

290
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:41,950
Chinese peony roots.

291
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,687
What's it used for?

292
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:49,556
-lt's an aspirin substitute.
-Tell him why.

293
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,562
She suffers from dysmenorrhea.

294
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:55,127
Cramps.

295
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:59,136
Miss Carlson,
l'm ready whenever you are.

296
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:00,762
Thank you.

297
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:05,072
You're supposed
to be on my side, Frank.

298
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,136
Could've at least given me
the benefit of the doubt.

299
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:11,876
You're right. l'm sorry.

300
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,713
Do you mind
waiting 15 minutes?

301
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:15,309
Not at all.

302
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:17,378
Look around.

303
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,273
Just a little pain
in the lumbar.

304
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:15,975
Here, pussy-puss.

305
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,013
Hello, kitty.

306
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,553
Such a beautiful kitty.

307
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:55,711
ls it still raining?

308
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:03,490
Can you drive me home?

309
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:06,122
Sure. l'll give you a ride home.

310
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,096
l've never been in one of these.

311
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:16,868
Now's your chance.

312
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:33,185
Come in.

313
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:35,021
lt's a bad idea.

314
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:36,424
Why?

315
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,486
l'm your lawyer.
lt doesn't look good.

316
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:41,831
Nobody's looking.

317
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:46,066
Good night, Rebecca.

318
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,115
Are you scared?

319
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:01,118
Not if you tell me
l shouldn't be.

320
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,819
We're going to kick their ass.

321
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,063
All rise.

322
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:15,258
Superior Court for
the county of Multnomah...

323
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,892
is now in session.

324
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:19,436
The Honorable Judge
Mabel Burnham presiding.

325
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:22,336
l can't change the titillating
nature of this trial...

326
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:24,136
but if l had wanted
to work in a circus...

327
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:26,404
l would've learned
how to ride a trapeze...

328
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:30,141
so l will not put up
with any performances...

329
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:32,979
by counsel or by the gallery.

330
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:35,611
Are the people ready to proceed,
Mr. Garrett?

331
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,120
Yes, Your Honor.

332
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,791
Andrew Marsh made
what turned out to be...

333
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,064
a fatal mistake.

334
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:55,105
He fell in love.

335
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:56,800
He fell in love...

336
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:59,274
with a ruthless,
calculating woman...

337
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:02,313
who went after an elderly man
with a bad heart...

338
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,713
and a big bank account.

339
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:08,275
You all can see the defendant,
Rebecca Carlson...

340
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:11,151
but as this trial proceeds...

341
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,817
you will see
she's not only the defendant...

342
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,053
she is the murder weapon itself.

343
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:18,824
lf l hit you...

344
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,023
and you die...

345
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:22,032
l am the cause of your death...

346
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,364
but can l be called a weapon?

347
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:27,165
The answer is yes...

348
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:31,208
and what a deadly weapon
Rebecca Carlson made.

349
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:34,710
The state will prove
that she seduced Andrew Marsh...

350
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,372
and manipulated
his affections...

351
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:41,408
until he rewrote his will,
leaving her $8 million...

352
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:45,388
that she insisted on
increasingly strenuous sex...

353
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:48,017
knowing he had
a severe heart condition...

354
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:51,392
and when that didn't
work fast enough for her...

355
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:53,988
she secretly doped him
with cocaine.

356
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:58,502
His heart couldn't take
the combination...

357
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,663
and she got what she wanted.

358
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:05,275
She is a beautiful woman...

359
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:07,038
but when this trial is over...

360
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:10,570
you will see her no differently
than a gun or a knife...

361
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,482
or any other instrument
used as a weapon.

362
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:18,281
She's a killer...

363
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:20,119
and the worst kind--

364
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:25,494
a killer who disguised herself
as a loving partner.

365
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:32,900
Mr. Dulaney.

366
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:34,301
Ladies and gentlemen...

367
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:36,840
you were told
during jury selection...

368
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:38,842
that the testimony
in this trial...

369
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:40,844
would be sexually explicit...

370
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:43,346
and you may find it offensive.

371
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:46,043
You may even be disgusted
by what you hear.

372
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:50,713
But l want you to remember
that Rebecca Carlson...

373
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:53,349
is not on trial
for her sexual tastes.

374
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:55,484
She is being tried for murder...

375
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,688
and to charge her
with murder is ludicrous.

376
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:01,231
The state would like you
to believe...

377
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:05,895
that she somehow fornicated
Andrew Marsh to death.

378
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:10,270
But the state's case
is built on fantasy, not fact.

379
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,276
And the facts, as they are...

380
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,279
are entirely circumstantial.

381
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:18,248
lt's not a crime
to be a beautiful woman.

382
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:21,308
lt's not a crime to fall in love
with an older man.

383
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:23,786
This case should have never
come to trial.

384
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,289
But since it has...

385
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:30,055
l know you'll listen
to the testimony objectively.

386
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:33,325
And when you hear
the evidence objectively...

387
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:38,199
you will acquit Rebecca Carlson
of the charges against her.

388
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:41,296
Dr. McCurdy,
did you find any indication...

389
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:44,807
that Mr. Marsh used cocaine
on a regular basis?

390
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,344
No. His nasal membranes
were way too smooth...

391
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:49,073
for even occasional use.

392
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:55,746
Were you able to determine
how he ingested this drug?

393
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:59,347
A bottle of nasal spray
found next to the bed...

394
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:01,654
was filled with a solution
of water and cocaine.

395
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:04,251
The victim had a head cold
at the time of his death.

396
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:06,456
l believe he was drugged
without his knowledge.

397
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:08,260
Objection--
lack of foundation.

398
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,766
The witness is speculating.

399
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:11,768
Motion to strike the testimony.

400
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,132
So ordered.

401
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,172
The jury should disregard
the witness' comment.

402
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:19,810
Was this the spray you found,
Doctor?

403
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,279
Yes, that's it.

404
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:27,317
Entered as People's Exhibit ''A.''

405
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:31,082
Now, Dr. McCurdy,
what would cocaine do...

406
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:33,283
to someone
in Mr. Marsh's condition?

407
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:35,292
lt would accelerate
his heartbeat.

408
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,952
And if he were having sex...

409
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:39,724
while under the influence
of such a stimulant?

410
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:41,823
lt would be the same
as shooting a loaded gun at him.

411
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:45,835
Now, you said
in your autopsy report...

412
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:49,600
that Mr. Marsh was restrained
at the time of his death.

413
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:51,005
Can you explain that, please?

414
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:54,375
From the marks on
his wrists and the bedstead...

415
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,573
l believe that the victim
was handcuffed.

416
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:58,616
At the time of his death?

417
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:01,379
Yes. The bruising and friction
was quite extensive.

418
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,752
Thank you, Dr. McCurdy.

419
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:05,983
Your witness.

420
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:11,853
Dr. McCurdy, you testified
that in your opinion...

421
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,262
Mr. Marsh suffered
his fatal heart attack...

422
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:15,697
while he was restrained.

423
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:16,961
Yes, sir.

424
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:19,265
And your evidence for this...

425
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:21,032
is the marks on his wrist,
am l right?

426
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,299
You are correct.

427
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:25,808
Now, couldn't those
same marks have been made...

428
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:31,109
while he was flailing about
in the throes of sexual ecstasy?

429
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:35,810
l suppose.

430
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:38,879
Did you find any older marks...

431
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:41,721
indicating
the use of restraints?

432
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:43,226
Just on his ankles.

433
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:44,886
Where they wouldn't
show in public.

434
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:47,261
Objection--counsel's
drawing his own conclusion.

435
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,425
Sustained.
You know better, Counsel.

436
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:53,631
Dr. McCurdy,
can you medically say...

437
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:56,366
that Mr. Marsh
didn't decide to get high?

438
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,876
lt seems very unlikely that
a man in his circumstances--

439
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:04,210
Dr. McCurdy, are you
a licensed psychiatrist?

440
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:05,772
Objection--argumentative.

441
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,283
Sustained.

442
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,320
How did you reach
your conclusion...

443
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:11,855
about what Mr. Marsh
would or wouldn't do?

444
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:13,117
Common sense.

445
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:17,819
Did you find any evidence
of that in the autopsy?

446
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:21,855
Do you know for a fact that
Mr. Marsh had any common sense?

447
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:24,868
You just testified
he liked unpleasant things.

448
00:28:24,936 --> 00:28:26,961
Your Honor.

449
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,673
No further questions.

450
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:36,873
lt's going to be a long trial
for you, Counselor...

451
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:41,044
if l have to start warning you
on the first day.

452
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,815
Where do you work, Dr. Paley?

453
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,150
l am an emergency room
physician...

454
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,815
at Memorial Hospital.

455
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:50,327
Were you on duty the night
of February 5th of this year?

456
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,829
l was the admitting physician.

457
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:56,025
-Did you admit Andrew Marsh?
-Yes, l did.

458
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:57,261
What was the reason?

459
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:59,200
Cocaine poisoning.

460
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:04,207
Did Mr. Marsh discuss
the circumstances with you?

461
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,243
Yes, he did.

462
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:09,803
l read my notes again
before l came to be accurate.

463
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:12,907
According to my notes,
the patient told me...

464
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:15,384
that it was the first time
he tried cocaine...

465
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:17,114
and it was going to be the last.

466
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:19,986
Would you describe
his condition, please?

467
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:23,255
He presented
a galaxy of symptoms.

468
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:26,263
Hyperpyrexia--
which is a high fever...

469
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:29,266
associated with
cocaine intoxication--

470
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:31,268
severely elevated
blood pressure...

471
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:33,804
arrhythmia,
shortness of breath.

472
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:36,306
And while l was
examining the patient...

473
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:38,808
he experienced
status epilepticus.

474
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:41,812
ls it common to have
so many symptoms occur...

475
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,677
in cases
of cocaine poisoning?

476
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:46,478
This patient
was particularly sensitive.

477
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:49,816
l thought he was lucky
to go home alive.

478
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:52,322
Did you tell him that,
Dr. Paley?

479
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,824
l told him if he ever
tried cocaine again...

480
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:56,861
he would be committing suicide.

481
00:29:58,396 --> 00:29:59,829
Your witness.

482
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,992
No questions for
this witness, Your Honor.

483
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:07,834
Did you see Mr. Marsh
the day before he died?

484
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:09,873
How did he look?

485
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:11,374
He was pale and sweating.

486
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:14,843
Did you talk about Miss Carlson?

487
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:17,380
And what did he say?

488
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:19,382
That he was worried.

489
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,883
l was worried.

490
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:22,886
He said that
if she kept it up...

491
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:24,387
she was going to kill him...

492
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:26,218
his heart couldn't take it.

493
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:29,351
Thank you. No more questions.

494
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:37,401
Miss Braslow, this strikes me
as an intimate conversation...

495
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:39,936
for a boss to have
with his secretary.

496
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,438
Did you often
discuss his love life?

497
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,805
We had
a professional relationship...

498
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:47,436
but l had been
his secretary for six years.

499
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,945
He liked to talk to me.

500
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,447
Did he also mention to you...

501
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,952
that Rebecca was thinking
about moving back to Chicago?

502
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,452
Yes, he mentioned it.

503
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,991
So, the woman that
he loved passionately...

504
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:02,255
was thinking about leaving.

505
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:03,589
Couldn't that have caused...

506
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:05,720
the stress and anxiety
you observed?

507
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:08,322
Objection--
calls for rank speculation!

508
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,766
Counsel for the prosecution
has already used this witness...

509
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:14,896
to establish the state of mind
of the deceased.

510
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:17,031
He opened the can, Your Honor.

511
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:21,202
And l do see worms crawling
all around you, Mr. Garrett.

512
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,009
You can't have it both ways.
Objection overruled.

513
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:25,947
Answer the question,
Miss Braslow.

514
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:29,145
l suppose it's possible.

515
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:37,461
Now, you testified
that you saw Rebecca...

516
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:40,361
inhaling cocaine
in the bathroom.

517
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:41,921
How do you know it was cocaine?

518
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,831
lt was white powder.

519
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:47,503
Were you ever a patient...

520
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,507
at the Mount Hood
Substance Abuse Center?

521
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:51,700
Objection!

522
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:53,276
Your Honor, Miss Braslow's
medical history--

523
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:56,643
Your Honor, the prosecution
has introduced cocaine...

524
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:58,841
as one of the contributing
causes of death.

525
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,782
This is a reasonable
line of questioning.

526
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,251
l'll allow it.

527
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:05,888
Weren't you a patient...

528
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:08,187
at the Mount Hood
Substance Abuse Center...

529
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:12,252
from January 5th
to February 5th two years ago?

530
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,354
Yes.

531
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,456
What were you being treated for?

532
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:21,733
Substance and alcohol abuse.

533
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:24,069
And was that substance cocaine?

534
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:30,109
Was that substance cocaine?

535
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:34,177
Yes.

536
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:38,322
And didn't you supply
your boss Mr. Marsh...

537
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:40,448
with the cocaine
that sent him to the hospital...

538
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:42,584
with cocaine poisoning
this year?

539
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,629
Your Honor,
l have in my hand...

540
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:48,461
a copy of the admissions report.

541
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:52,560
The square right here
is designated...

542
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,797
for the signature
of the responsible party...

543
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:57,204
the person who brought him
into the hospital.

544
00:32:57,275 --> 00:33:00,142
Would you read
that name out loud, please?

545
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:05,346
Would you read
the name out loud, please?

546
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:09,886
Joanne Braslow. But l--

547
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:11,387
No further questions.

548
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:14,687
Your Honor,
l submit Defense Exhibit ''A.''

549
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,921
For your files.

550
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:44,646
Did you always
want to be a lawyer?

551
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:46,189
lt was a fallback.

552
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:48,919
l wanted to be
a pro hockey player.

553
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:51,461
What happened?

554
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:55,795
l broke my ankle skating.
l was showing off.

555
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,164
How old were you?

556
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:59,203
Seven.

557
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,966
When l was a kid,
l liked to steal strawberries.

558
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:09,808
l'd sneak into
the neighbor's yard.

559
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:13,874
l remember they had a big fence.

560
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:18,388
l'd always scrape my knees
climbing over it.

561
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:22,222
On the other side,
they had these wild rose bushes.

562
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:25,387
The thorns
would dig into my legs...

563
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:28,023
and cut my thighs
when l slid down.

564
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:32,297
But the strawberries
always tasted so sweet.

565
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,871
Because of how much
it hurt to get them.

566
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:45,448
When you first met Andrew...

567
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:49,282
how did you know
that he was like you?

568
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:55,458
l was at a party...

569
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:58,461
and there was
a huge crowd of people...

570
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:01,464
but we just saw each other,
and we knew.

571
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:02,897
Just like that?

572
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,566
Look around.

573
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:12,370
You want me to look around
and tell you...

574
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:16,345
if someone here
has the same taste that l do?

575
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,278
That's right.

576
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:46,009
All right. Who?

577
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,813
l'm not going to tell you.

578
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:53,009
You're not going to tell me?

579
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:54,278
No, l'm not going to tell you.

580
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:55,512
Why not?

581
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:58,817
Because he doesn't know it yet.

582
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:23,105
Yes, it would be nice.

583
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,739
What would?

584
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:27,306
You and l making love.

585
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:30,616
ls that what you think
l was thinking?

586
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,823
There's nothing wrong
with admitting you want me.

587
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,463
You take a lot for granted.

588
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:55,044
Frank...go home.

589
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,016
Thanks for dinner.

590
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,290
Good night.

591
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:44,451
My way.

592
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:22,256
Are you scared?

593
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:23,994
No.

594
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:26,238
Would you see
if Michael's up yet?

595
00:47:32,382 --> 00:47:36,478
The people would like to recall
Dr. Alan Paley to the stand.

596
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:57,397
Dr. Paley,
you're still under oath here.

597
00:47:57,507 --> 00:47:59,236
Take it seriously.

598
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:03,578
Do you know Rebecca Carlson?

599
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:05,080
Yes.

600
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:08,447
Did you, in fact,
date Miss Carlson?

601
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:12,055
Yes, we dated.

602
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:18,025
Keep your rude mouths shut
or get out of my courtroom.

603
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:20,791
This is the only time
l'll ask nicely.

604
00:48:20,864 --> 00:48:22,661
Proceed, Mr. Garrett.

605
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,325
Did you ever discuss...

606
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:27,768
anything about your patient,
Mr. Marsh, with her?

607
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:33,209
His picture
was on the social page...

608
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:35,609
and l mentioned
that l'd treated him.

609
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:36,976
What was her reaction?

610
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:38,674
She was fascinated.

611
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,946
Did she ask you anything
in particular about him?

612
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:45,487
She wanted to know...

613
00:48:45,555 --> 00:48:48,285
whether cocaine would kill him
if he tried it again.

614
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:50,417
And what did you say?

615
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:52,689
l told her it would be
a Russian roulette.

616
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:55,560
Your witness.

617
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:03,137
Dr. Paley,
why didn't you mention...

618
00:49:03,206 --> 00:49:05,674
your relationship
with Rebecca earlier?

619
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,573
Nobody asked me.

620
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:11,374
Did you have
sexual relations with her?

621
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:12,642
Objection--irrelevant.

622
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:14,377
Your Honor,
if you'll allow some latitude...

623
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,214
l can establish the relevance.

624
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:19,153
You'd better.
Objection overruled.

625
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:21,588
The witness is directed
to answer the question.

626
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:23,751
No.

627
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:25,886
No, you did not have
sexual relations?

628
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:26,952
No, we didn't.

629
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:30,022
Because she refused
to have sex with you.

630
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,897
Objection--Your Honor...

631
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,800
the counsel is trying
to manufacture--

632
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:35,872
Get up here, both of you!

633
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:43,712
Mr. Dulaney,
if you're just bottom-feeding...

634
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,372
you're going to choke
on the mud.

635
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:47,713
l'm working toward
a specific point, Your Honor.

636
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:48,944
Work fast.

637
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:51,783
l'm getting tired of seeing you
this close to me.

638
00:49:51,855 --> 00:49:53,083
Objection overruled.

639
00:49:58,395 --> 00:50:01,125
Dr. Paley, do you remember
your last date...

640
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:03,393
with Rebecca at
the Cat and Fiddle restaurant?

641
00:50:06,903 --> 00:50:09,337
lt wasn't that memorable.

642
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:10,930
Well, do you remember...

643
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:13,737
trying to force yourself on her
in the parking lot?

644
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:14,936
Objection!

645
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,843
l can bring in
the parking attendant...

646
00:50:16,913 --> 00:50:20,440
and two customers to refresh
your memory if l have to.

647
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:23,486
l didn't hear the reason for
your objection, Mr. Garrett.

648
00:50:23,553 --> 00:50:26,283
Wasn't that the last time
you saw Rebecca...

649
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,290
until appearing in court,
Dr. Paley?

650
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:31,122
l don't remember
the last time l saw her.

651
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:33,287
ln fact,
didn't you attempt...

652
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,627
to blackmail her
into seeing you again...

653
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:39,294
by threatening
to falsely testify against her?

654
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:41,303
No. You're crazy.

655
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:43,339
Your Honor, l have a tape...

656
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,238
from Rebecca's answering machine
l'd like to play.

657
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:48,436
Objection--we don't know
where this tape is from...

658
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:49,843
or who made it,
or under what circumstance.

659
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:51,244
May l approach?

660
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:54,943
l have reports from
two independent audio labs...

661
00:50:55,018 --> 00:50:58,476
that Mr. Garrett himself
has used to verify evidence...

662
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,284
in other trials.

663
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:02,723
They both conclude
that the voice on the tape...

664
00:51:02,793 --> 00:51:06,160
was recorded over the phone,
with no tampering.

665
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,220
l'll allow it.

666
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:21,634
l know you're there.

667
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:24,737
Pick up the phone, god damn it.

668
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:27,113
You think l won't do it?

669
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:37,788
l can put you away, Rebecca,
for the rest of your life.

670
00:51:38,995 --> 00:51:40,826
You'd better call me...

671
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:43,832
or you're fucked
one way or the other.

672
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:52,340
What did you mean, Dr. Paley?

673
00:51:56,446 --> 00:52:00,439
You never told her
about Andrew Marsh, did you?

674
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:03,145
Yes, l did.
She asked me, and l told her.

675
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:05,450
Perjury is
a criminal charge, Doctor!

676
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:06,784
l am not lying.

677
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:10,753
No further questions.

678
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:19,467
You were brilliant.

679
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:21,400
l didn't break him all the way.

680
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:23,530
You burned him down.

681
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,771
-Gabe, hit P3.
-You got it.

682
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:57,764
See you tomorrow.

683
00:52:57,874 --> 00:52:59,808
-OK.
-Bye.

684
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:18,324
Could somebody hit P4, please?

685
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:21,897
Thank you.

686
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:52,659
Let's go.

687
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:58,067
Somebody's going to see us.

688
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:00,929
Come on.

689
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:24,971
The people call Jeffrey Roston.

690
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,572
Do you know him?

691
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:43,428
May l approach?

692
00:56:49,672 --> 00:56:51,606
Your Honor, this witness
has never been mentioned...

693
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:53,107
by the prosecution.

694
00:56:53,176 --> 00:56:54,609
Our investigators didn't
contact Mr. Roston...

695
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:56,474
until yesterday afternoon
in New York.

696
00:56:56,546 --> 00:56:57,979
What took so long?

697
00:56:58,047 --> 00:57:00,413
He just came home from
an extended vacation.

698
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:03,975
All right. l'm going
to allow the testimony.

699
00:57:04,053 --> 00:57:06,317
That's it, Counselor.
Take a seat.

700
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:19,326
Mr. Roston,
what was your relationship...

701
00:57:19,402 --> 00:57:22,337
with Miss Carlson?

702
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:23,667
We were lovers.

703
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:26,038
How long were you together?

704
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,542
For about a year.

705
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:32,673
How would you describe
your sex life with her?

706
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:39,720
lt was...very intense.

707
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:42,690
l know this is very personal...

708
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:46,354
but l'm going to ask you
to be more specific.

709
00:57:50,266 --> 00:57:51,699
She was always trying...

710
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:54,737
to get me
more and more worked up.

711
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:56,533
By what means?

712
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:02,742
l couldn't do everything
she wanted in my condition.

713
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:05,406
What condition is that?

714
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,584
l had a bad heart.

715
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:18,626
What happened next?

716
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:19,923
l had bypass surgery.

717
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:20,963
How are you now?

718
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:22,725
l'm fine.

719
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:26,530
My doctor says
l can live to be a very old man.

720
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:31,673
How did your relationship
with the defendant...

721
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:33,435
progress after the surgery?

722
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:38,504
lt just ground to a sudden halt.
She left me.

723
00:58:38,581 --> 00:58:41,072
Why did she say she was leaving?

724
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:43,550
She didn't. She just left.

725
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:45,110
Why do you think she left you?

726
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:48,089
Objection--question
calls for a conclusion...

727
00:58:48,157 --> 00:58:49,283
on the part of the witness.

728
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:50,849
Objection sustained.

729
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:53,896
When you say
your sexual relations...

730
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:56,056
with Miss Carlson
were intense...

731
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:58,862
in what way?

732
00:58:58,935 --> 00:59:02,496
lt was as if she were trying
to push me...

733
00:59:02,605 --> 00:59:04,038
as far as she could.

734
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:05,903
Can you give the court
an example?

735
00:59:08,144 --> 00:59:11,011
Sex was a game to her.

736
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,139
She got off on the control.

737
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:17,152
She always used to tell me
it had to be her way.

738
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:20,985
A few nights before my bypass,
l woke up...

739
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:24,185
and she'd tied me to the bed.

740
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:26,819
With handcuffs?

741
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,030
No...

742
00:59:32,101 --> 00:59:33,762
with my own belt.

743
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:42,410
And what did she say?

744
00:59:45,481 --> 00:59:47,574
Mr. Roston, l know
this is difficult for you...

745
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:49,481
but it is important.

746
00:59:49,552 --> 00:59:51,315
Please tell the court.

747
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:56,055
She said
she was going to fuck me...

748
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:58,355
like l'd never
been fucked before.

749
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:02,292
Bailiff, clear the courtroom.

750
01:00:02,365 --> 01:00:04,993
Everyone except the reporters.

751
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:41,326
After she tied you up,
Mr. Roston...

752
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:42,734
what did she do next?

753
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:45,440
She started...

754
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:49,477
masturbating...

755
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:55,006
and telling me how much
she wanted me inside her.

756
01:00:57,787 --> 01:00:59,482
lt drove me crazy.

757
01:00:59,555 --> 01:01:03,548
Did your heart
start to bother you?

758
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:05,059
Yeah.

759
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:13,602
We were making love...

760
01:01:13,703 --> 01:01:16,604
and she was on top of me.

761
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:20,905
And every time l got close...

762
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,337
she'd stop.

763
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:29,518
And l couldn't take it.

764
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,887
l couldn't breathe.

765
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:36,720
l was suffocating.

766
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:38,761
l begged her.

767
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:44,526
l really thought
that l was about to die.

768
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:48,103
Did you change your will...

769
01:01:48,171 --> 01:01:51,106
while you were involved
with Miss Carlson?

770
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:54,209
Yes.

771
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:57,336
And who was
the primary beneficiary?

772
01:01:57,413 --> 01:01:59,176
She was.

773
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:07,316
l was very much in love
with her.

774
01:02:09,859 --> 01:02:13,488
And l was a fool.

775
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,190
Thank you, Mr. Roston.

776
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:16,561
No further questions.

777
01:02:18,034 --> 01:02:19,228
Counsel.

778
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:20,929
No questions.

779
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:29,304
l can explain everything.

780
01:02:36,619 --> 01:02:38,177
You're a little late.

781
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:40,119
l needed to know
before he testified!

782
01:02:40,189 --> 01:02:41,747
Why the fuck didn't you warn me?

783
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:44,418
You need to hear about every man
l ever had sex with?

784
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:47,691
Just the ones with bad hearts
who put you in their wills!

785
01:02:49,165 --> 01:02:50,757
You think l killed Andrew?

786
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:52,664
So does everyone
in that courtroom !

787
01:02:52,735 --> 01:02:54,669
You made me
look like shit in there!

788
01:02:54,737 --> 01:02:56,261
You are not on trial!

789
01:02:56,372 --> 01:02:57,964
The hell l'm not!

790
01:02:58,074 --> 01:03:00,975
l must've been out of my mind
to get involved with you.

791
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:02,339
To make love to me?

792
01:03:02,411 --> 01:03:04,777
Yes.

793
01:03:04,847 --> 01:03:07,179
But l'm not going
to compound my mistakes.

794
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:08,945
You're my client. That's it.

795
01:03:09,018 --> 01:03:11,543
l don't want anything
to do with you beyond that.

796
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:15,148
Just like that?

797
01:03:15,224 --> 01:03:17,419
Like l don't have any feelings?

798
01:03:17,493 --> 01:03:20,121
Hey, l'm not your type.

799
01:03:20,196 --> 01:03:21,959
l'm too young and healthy.

800
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:25,057
That's not fair, Frank.

801
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:28,297
No...but it's accurate.

802
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:31,431
Fuck you, too.

803
01:03:45,855 --> 01:03:47,152
Hi.

804
01:03:52,195 --> 01:03:53,526
Where's Michael?

805
01:03:55,431 --> 01:03:57,695
l took him over to Kevin's
to spend the night.

806
01:03:57,767 --> 01:03:59,997
Why didn't you tell me?
l could've stayed at the office.

807
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:01,399
l got a shitload of work.

808
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:04,905
You mean you could've screwed
your client.

809
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:06,406
That's paranoid.

810
01:04:06,475 --> 01:04:07,669
Oh, man.

811
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:14,746
Fine.

812
01:04:25,995 --> 01:04:27,428
Go away!

813
01:04:27,496 --> 01:04:29,191
Talk to me.

814
01:04:29,265 --> 01:04:31,665
People see your car
down by the river...

815
01:04:31,734 --> 01:04:33,702
in front of
her goddamn houseboat.

816
01:04:33,803 --> 01:04:35,236
lt gets back to me, Frank!

817
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:36,737
She's my client.

818
01:04:36,806 --> 01:04:39,434
l'm allowed to have
conferences with my client.

819
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:41,737
Why can't you have them
in your office?

820
01:04:41,811 --> 01:04:44,405
l can't believe you listen
to this bullshit gossip.

821
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:45,970
l talked to her!

822
01:04:47,683 --> 01:04:48,843
What?

823
01:04:48,918 --> 01:04:51,546
She called here tonight
looking for you.

824
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:52,918
What did she say?

825
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:54,456
She didn't
have to say anything.

826
01:04:54,523 --> 01:04:55,649
l could hear it in her voice.

827
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:57,352
ln the way
that she said your name.

828
01:04:57,426 --> 01:04:59,155
You're making this up.

829
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:01,059
What did she do to you, Frank?

830
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:03,564
How did you get
those marks on your chest?

831
01:05:03,633 --> 01:05:05,066
What are they?

832
01:05:05,134 --> 01:05:07,898
What are they, bites?

833
01:05:09,205 --> 01:05:11,139
What happened to your back?

834
01:05:14,343 --> 01:05:16,243
l thought we were happy.

835
01:05:20,883 --> 01:05:24,216
l thought we were a family.

836
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:25,879
l trusted you.

837
01:05:25,955 --> 01:05:28,321
lt has nothing to do with you.

838
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:35,790
You son of a bitch.

839
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:42,370
How dare you stand there
and say that to me?

840
01:05:42,471 --> 01:05:45,770
l love you. You're my wife.

841
01:05:47,043 --> 01:05:48,943
Go pack some things.

842
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:51,707
l don't want to see you
when l get home.

843
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:54,215
Please, Sharon.
l don't want to lose you.

844
01:05:55,518 --> 01:05:57,952
Then you shouldn't
have fucked her.

845
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:18,564
What the hell
did you say to my wife?

846
01:06:18,674 --> 01:06:21,609
Nothing. l asked if you were
there and you weren't.

847
01:06:21,677 --> 01:06:22,769
Why did you call?

848
01:06:22,845 --> 01:06:24,870
l wanted to know
if l still had a lawyer.

849
01:06:24,947 --> 01:06:26,141
You're such a liar!

850
01:06:27,717 --> 01:06:29,150
What do you think, Frank...

851
01:06:29,218 --> 01:06:31,948
l called to tell her
all the nasty details?

852
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:34,080
Maybe l gave her some advice.

853
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:40,954
Maybe l called to reassure her
that it was over between us.

854
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:42,292
Maybe that's what l said.

855
01:06:47,603 --> 01:06:50,071
Gets easier, doesn't it, Frank?

856
01:08:49,325 --> 01:08:51,088
Let's play another game.

857
01:09:32,101 --> 01:09:33,728
You fuck.

858
01:10:11,106 --> 01:10:12,664
Frank!

859
01:10:12,775 --> 01:10:15,767
Frank, get up!
Conference room !

860
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:17,140
Come on, hurry!

861
01:10:23,419 --> 01:10:25,512
Now, this guy was really
into filming this shit.

862
01:10:25,588 --> 01:10:28,056
He could open up
his own video store.

863
01:10:35,464 --> 01:10:37,056
How does this help us?

864
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:38,690
Wait. Just watch this.

865
01:10:38,767 --> 01:10:40,997
l would've missed this, too,
but the phone rang.

866
01:10:41,103 --> 01:10:43,537
l let the tape play
while l talked.

867
01:10:43,606 --> 01:10:45,972
Garrett thought
the show was over.

868
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:47,508
This isn't a blank tape.

869
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:51,137
lt's been erased,
just not quite all of it.

870
01:10:57,653 --> 01:10:59,416
This was
during his artsy phase...

871
01:10:59,488 --> 01:11:01,547
before he went back
to using the tripod.

872
01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:18,938
''We had a professional
relationship.''

873
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:22,367
You're embarrassing me.

874
01:11:22,478 --> 01:11:26,312
The court
recalls Joanne Braslow.

875
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:57,110
Miss Braslow, how much
did you stand to inherit...

876
01:11:57,212 --> 01:12:01,114
before Mr. Marsh modified
his will in Rebecca's favor?

877
01:12:01,183 --> 01:12:04,152
$250,000.

878
01:12:04,219 --> 01:12:06,483
And according
to his final will?

879
01:12:06,555 --> 01:12:08,989
$10,000,
which is still a large amount...

880
01:12:09,058 --> 01:12:11,993
and l'm very grateful to him
for remembering me at all.

881
01:12:12,061 --> 01:12:14,427
After all
your years of service...

882
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:16,088
it doesn't seem like a lot.

883
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:18,326
l'm not greedy.

884
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,858
No. ln fact, you're a saint.

885
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:23,494
He cut you out of his will...

886
01:12:23,605 --> 01:12:24,867
he dumped you
for a younger woman...

887
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:27,773
and you still say
kind things about the man.

888
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:29,777
Objection--counsel's
arguing with the witness.

889
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:31,335
Move to strike, Your Honor.

890
01:12:31,413 --> 01:12:34,439
l'll sustain it.
Strike counsel's remarks.

891
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:38,646
Joanne, you have to start
telling the truth now.

892
01:12:40,989 --> 01:12:44,516
Weren't you a very personal
friend of Andrew Marsh?

893
01:12:44,593 --> 01:12:47,118
What do you mean?

894
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:49,892
-Weren't you lovers?
-No.

895
01:12:49,965 --> 01:12:52,763
Do l have to enter
into evidence a videotape...

896
01:12:52,835 --> 01:12:54,268
that Andrew made of you...

897
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:57,703
that indicates
how very close you were?

898
01:13:05,414 --> 01:13:06,881
We dated.

899
01:13:06,949 --> 01:13:08,814
Until he met Rebecca?

900
01:13:10,452 --> 01:13:11,851
Yes.

901
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,888
Did you love him?

902
01:13:13,956 --> 01:13:16,186
Of course l did.

903
01:13:16,258 --> 01:13:17,850
Didn't you think
it was cruel of him...

904
01:13:17,926 --> 01:13:19,655
to confide in you
about Rebecca...

905
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:21,696
after he'd broken up
with you?

906
01:13:21,764 --> 01:13:23,595
Objection--the testimony
has no relevance...

907
01:13:23,665 --> 01:13:25,155
to the issues in this trial.

908
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:28,226
l'll withdraw the question.
Were you hurt?

909
01:13:30,839 --> 01:13:33,205
What do you think?

910
01:13:33,275 --> 01:13:34,970
l was crushed.

911
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:39,403
But l knew it wouldn't last.

912
01:13:39,481 --> 01:13:43,247
You expected him to come back
to you after it was over?

913
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:47,051
Men don't marry women like her.

914
01:13:51,994 --> 01:13:55,623
Didn't he tell you
he asked Rebecca to marry him?

915
01:13:55,697 --> 01:13:57,187
She turned him down.

916
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:59,700
She'd already gotten
everything she wanted.

917
01:13:59,768 --> 01:14:00,826
But you didn't?

918
01:14:00,903 --> 01:14:03,371
Objection--counsel's
putting the witness on trial.

919
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:08,542
l loved him.

920
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:12,580
l never would have hurt him.

921
01:14:12,648 --> 01:14:14,013
Even if he asked?

922
01:14:15,384 --> 01:14:16,681
Your Honor?

923
01:14:16,752 --> 01:14:18,185
That's enough, Mr. Dulaney.

924
01:14:18,253 --> 01:14:21,188
Objection sustained.
Strike Mr. Dulaney's question.

925
01:14:21,256 --> 01:14:24,817
Was that your entire bag
of tricks, Counselor...

926
01:14:24,893 --> 01:14:28,158
or do you have
another line of questioning?

927
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:36,837
You testified that you ran
errands for Andrew Marsh.

928
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:39,772
Such as going to the drugstore?

929
01:14:39,842 --> 01:14:43,573
Buying nasal spray for him
because he had a cold?

930
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:47,479
You signed a house charge
for nasal spray on April 8th...

931
01:14:47,549 --> 01:14:50,541
the date
of Andrew Marsh's death.

932
01:14:50,619 --> 01:14:52,314
l'd like to introduce...

933
01:14:52,387 --> 01:14:54,287
the receipt
from Montclair Pharmacy...

934
01:14:54,356 --> 01:14:56,119
as exhibit ''H.''

935
01:15:00,896 --> 01:15:03,490
That was the bottle
used to kill him.

936
01:15:03,565 --> 01:15:07,467
There was no other nasal spray
found in the house.

937
01:15:07,569 --> 01:15:10,766
ls it true that
you put in the cocaine...

938
01:15:10,873 --> 01:15:13,273
because you were jealous?

939
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:14,900
Because he cut you
out of his will?

940
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:17,444
Because you have
a cocaine habit to feed?

941
01:15:17,546 --> 01:15:19,446
You're out of line, Counselor.

942
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:21,483
Strike his remarks.

943
01:15:23,752 --> 01:15:26,585
l don't think l want to answer
any more questions...

944
01:15:26,655 --> 01:15:28,054
without an attorney.

945
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:40,127
She killed him.

946
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:41,897
She set me up
to take the fall...

947
01:15:42,004 --> 01:15:43,631
and she almost got away with it.

948
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:45,536
You know what bothers me?

949
01:15:45,607 --> 01:15:48,542
Why did she charge a three buck
bottle of nasal spray...

950
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:50,134
that could be
traced back to her...

951
01:15:50,245 --> 01:15:51,507
if she'd planned
to kill him with it?

952
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:53,605
l don't know.
Let Garrett figure that out.

953
01:15:53,682 --> 01:15:55,343
Maybe it was
a crime of opportunity.

954
01:15:55,417 --> 01:15:57,681
Maybe she's just stupid.

955
01:15:57,753 --> 01:16:00,449
You mean maybe l did it.

956
01:16:00,522 --> 01:16:02,217
Maybe you did.

957
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:06,759
lf the evidence
hasn't convinced you...

958
01:16:06,828 --> 01:16:10,764
how the hell is it supposed
to convince the jury?

959
01:16:10,832 --> 01:16:13,266
They can't wait to convict me.

960
01:16:13,335 --> 01:16:15,701
All you need
is a reasonable doubt.

961
01:16:15,804 --> 01:16:18,238
But l know how their minds work.

962
01:16:18,307 --> 01:16:21,242
The women hate me.
They think l'm a whore.

963
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:23,244
And the men see
a cold, heartless bitch...

964
01:16:23,312 --> 01:16:25,041
they can pay back
for every chick...

965
01:16:25,113 --> 01:16:26,603
that's ever
blown them off in a bar.

966
01:16:26,682 --> 01:16:30,743
You have an inflated opinion
of yourself.

967
01:16:30,819 --> 01:16:32,309
l have to testify.

968
01:16:32,387 --> 01:16:35,322
-No.
-Frank!

969
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:37,119
They're going to convict me...

970
01:16:37,192 --> 01:16:39,023
if l don't tell
my side of the story.

971
01:16:39,094 --> 01:16:41,722
The only reason l'd ever let
a client take the stand...

972
01:16:41,797 --> 01:16:43,924
is if the case
was going so badly...

973
01:16:43,999 --> 01:16:45,193
there wasn't any other choice.

974
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:47,360
The difference is
your clients are usually guilty.

975
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:49,028
You told me that.

976
01:16:49,137 --> 01:16:51,071
No. l said
they usually did it...

977
01:16:51,139 --> 01:16:53,403
which is different
than being guilty as charged.

978
01:16:53,475 --> 01:16:55,807
l'm not going to let you
fuck up my case.

979
01:16:55,877 --> 01:16:59,278
You owe me
the chance to explain, Frank.

980
01:17:53,435 --> 01:17:54,902
Wish me luck?

981
01:18:09,484 --> 01:18:13,113
The defense calls
Rebecca Carlson to the stand.

982
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:40,512
You swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth...

983
01:18:40,582 --> 01:18:42,675
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

984
01:18:42,751 --> 01:18:44,013
l do.

985
01:18:48,423 --> 01:18:51,881
l'd like you to recount,
as you remember...

986
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:55,418
the events on the night
of April 8th.

987
01:18:58,533 --> 01:19:01,058
We came home from dinner early.

988
01:19:01,169 --> 01:19:03,569
And Andrew still had a cold...

989
01:19:03,638 --> 01:19:05,833
so l thought l'd put him to bed
and go home.

990
01:19:05,941 --> 01:19:07,465
But you didn't go home,
did you?

991
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:11,672
No. He wanted to make love.

992
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:16,150
And that made me want to.
He was a very physical man.

993
01:19:16,218 --> 01:19:18,186
Would you say you loved him?

994
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:19,515
Very much.

995
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:22,955
Why didn't you marry him?

996
01:19:23,024 --> 01:19:25,857
Because his marriages
never lasted.

997
01:19:25,927 --> 01:19:28,691
l want it to last.

998
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:32,598
Rebecca, you heard
the forensic testimony...

999
01:19:32,667 --> 01:19:35,158
about the use of handcuffs.

1000
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:36,965
What were they doing
in the house?

1001
01:19:37,072 --> 01:19:39,506
Andrew bought them
for Valentine's Day.

1002
01:19:39,574 --> 01:19:41,599
For you--

1003
01:19:41,710 --> 01:19:45,271
For you to use on him
while you made love?

1004
01:19:45,347 --> 01:19:49,215
Yes. He liked that.

1005
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:52,276
He was always in charge
in his life and his work.

1006
01:19:52,354 --> 01:19:55,448
ln bed, he liked to have
somebody else in charge.

1007
01:19:55,524 --> 01:19:57,253
lt was a game we played.

1008
01:20:00,762 --> 01:20:05,222
Watch yourselves, or
l'll clear this courtroom again.

1009
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:08,133
Rebecca, did Andrew
indicate to you...

1010
01:20:08,236 --> 01:20:10,466
that he was having
any problems at all...

1011
01:20:10,572 --> 01:20:12,005
like shortness of breath...

1012
01:20:12,107 --> 01:20:13,597
while you were
making love that night?

1013
01:20:13,708 --> 01:20:15,767
No. He was fine.

1014
01:20:15,877 --> 01:20:17,469
And after you finished
making love...

1015
01:20:17,546 --> 01:20:18,638
what did you do?

1016
01:20:18,713 --> 01:20:21,045
l kissed him good night,
and l went home.

1017
01:20:21,116 --> 01:20:23,209
When did you find out
he was dead?

1018
01:20:24,786 --> 01:20:27,254
Not until the next day.

1019
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:28,789
And when did you find out...

1020
01:20:28,857 --> 01:20:31,223
you were a beneficiary
of Andrew's will?

1021
01:20:31,293 --> 01:20:33,227
When you told me.

1022
01:20:34,563 --> 01:20:35,928
Your witness.

1023
01:20:43,872 --> 01:20:46,067
l'm less interested
in your relationship...

1024
01:20:46,141 --> 01:20:48,575
with Andrew Marsh,
the nature of which...

1025
01:20:48,643 --> 01:20:50,110
you've made abundantly clear...

1026
01:20:50,212 --> 01:20:52,077
than l am
in your relationships...

1027
01:20:52,147 --> 01:20:56,015
with Jeffrey Roston
and Dr. Alan Paley.

1028
01:20:56,084 --> 01:20:59,576
How long after you stopped
dating Dr. Paley...

1029
01:20:59,654 --> 01:21:03,112
did you start dating
his patient Mr. Marsh?

1030
01:21:03,191 --> 01:21:06,126
lt must have been
about four months.

1031
01:21:06,194 --> 01:21:08,719
Four months in which you tried
to meet your victim...

1032
01:21:08,797 --> 01:21:10,230
at galleries
and museum openings?

1033
01:21:10,298 --> 01:21:12,823
Objection!
Counsel's baiting the witness.

1034
01:21:12,901 --> 01:21:14,926
Not at all.
l'm establishing premeditation.

1035
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:16,503
By baiting the witness.

1036
01:21:16,605 --> 01:21:18,835
Overruled.
Answer the question.

1037
01:21:18,907 --> 01:21:22,274
l never heard his name
before l met him.

1038
01:21:22,344 --> 01:21:24,369
You never saw
his picture in the paper?

1039
01:21:24,446 --> 01:21:25,879
l don't read the paper.

1040
01:21:27,415 --> 01:21:31,613
ls it your sworn testimony,
that by coincidence alone...

1041
01:21:31,686 --> 01:21:34,086
you happened to date
both Andrew Marsh...

1042
01:21:34,155 --> 01:21:36,589
who died from a combination
of sex and drugs...

1043
01:21:36,658 --> 01:21:40,116
and the doctor who treated him
for drug poisoning?

1044
01:21:40,195 --> 01:21:42,959
Portland's a small city.

1045
01:21:43,031 --> 01:21:46,023
l even dated a man
who dated a woman you dated.

1046
01:21:51,506 --> 01:21:52,939
Do you think you're capable...

1047
01:21:53,041 --> 01:21:55,566
of just answering
the questions put to you?

1048
01:21:55,677 --> 01:21:59,773
l'm just trying
to explain myself.

1049
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:05,378
The night
of Mr. Marsh's death...

1050
01:22:05,453 --> 01:22:07,819
were you watching
a pornographic videotape...

1051
01:22:07,889 --> 01:22:08,981
you'd made of yourselves?

1052
01:22:09,057 --> 01:22:11,355
Objection as
to the characterization!

1053
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:15,692
An explicit videotape?

1054
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:17,629
Andrew used to say...

1055
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:20,668
''Why watch strangers
when you can watch friends?''

1056
01:22:27,175 --> 01:22:29,109
lf you had
finished having sex...

1057
01:22:29,177 --> 01:22:31,202
and Mr. Marsh
was asleep as you stated...

1058
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:34,077
why was the VCR still on
when the police arrived?

1059
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:36,845
Because l forgot
to turn it off before l left.

1060
01:22:36,918 --> 01:22:38,317
Because Andrew Marsh
was already dead...

1061
01:22:38,386 --> 01:22:40,217
and you were in a hurry
to make your exit?

1062
01:22:40,288 --> 01:22:42,756
Objection!
Argumentative isn't the word...

1063
01:22:42,824 --> 01:22:44,348
for counsel's approach
to cross.

1064
01:22:44,426 --> 01:22:47,657
Sustained.
Watch yourself, Mr. Garrett.

1065
01:22:49,564 --> 01:22:50,861
Miss Carlson...

1066
01:22:50,932 --> 01:22:54,129
you stated that
you handcuffed Andrew Marsh...

1067
01:22:54,202 --> 01:22:56,636
before having sex with him
the night of his death.

1068
01:22:56,705 --> 01:23:00,232
lt wasn't before. lt was during.

1069
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:07,240
l stand corrected. Thank you.

1070
01:23:07,315 --> 01:23:09,249
Did you engage
in any other forms...

1071
01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:10,648
of dominance with the victim?

1072
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:13,449
Did you, for example, beat him?

1073
01:23:13,521 --> 01:23:14,886
Objection!

1074
01:23:14,956 --> 01:23:17,254
The specifics of
the sexual relationship...

1075
01:23:17,325 --> 01:23:18,690
between the victim
and the defendant...

1076
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:21,627
have no bearing
on the charges against her.

1077
01:23:21,696 --> 01:23:23,527
The state has
an obvious interest...

1078
01:23:23,598 --> 01:23:24,656
in a pattern of abuse...

1079
01:23:24,733 --> 01:23:26,200
that ended with
the death of the victim.

1080
01:23:26,267 --> 01:23:29,031
Answer the question,
Miss Carlson.

1081
01:23:29,137 --> 01:23:32,129
Succinctly, please.

1082
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:34,936
l never hurt him.

1083
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:36,944
Did you humiliate him?

1084
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:38,877
l never humiliated him, either.

1085
01:23:38,947 --> 01:23:40,972
He picked the games.

1086
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:44,117
You have a weakness...

1087
01:23:44,185 --> 01:23:46,244
for rich older men
with bad hearts...

1088
01:23:46,321 --> 01:23:48,915
don't you, Miss Carlson?

1089
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:53,689
l like confident men
who aren't afraid to experiment.

1090
01:23:53,762 --> 01:23:55,753
They tend to be older.

1091
01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:58,355
And l own a gallery.

1092
01:23:58,433 --> 01:24:00,128
People l meet
tend to have money.

1093
01:24:00,201 --> 01:24:02,601
l don't ask for
profit-and-loss statements.

1094
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:04,569
Are we supposed to believe...

1095
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:08,200
Jeffrey Roston and
Andrew Marsh are coincidences?

1096
01:24:08,309 --> 01:24:10,300
They had nothing
to do with each other.

1097
01:24:10,412 --> 01:24:12,972
They both had bad hearts,
didn't they?

1098
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:15,107
And they both wrote you
into their wills.

1099
01:24:15,183 --> 01:24:16,377
But l already testified...

1100
01:24:16,451 --> 01:24:18,681
l didn't know anything
about Andrew's heart.

1101
01:24:18,753 --> 01:24:21,483
But you knew about Roston's.

1102
01:24:29,497 --> 01:24:30,691
Yes.

1103
01:24:30,765 --> 01:24:33,131
And when you couldn't induce
a heart attack...

1104
01:24:33,201 --> 01:24:34,930
before he had surgery
to repair it...

1105
01:24:35,036 --> 01:24:36,367
you bailed out.

1106
01:24:36,471 --> 01:24:39,031
He wasn't any good to you.
lsn't that right?

1107
01:24:53,621 --> 01:24:56,454
l left him when l found him
in bed with someone else.

1108
01:24:56,524 --> 01:24:57,957
That was grounds for leaving...

1109
01:24:58,026 --> 01:25:00,119
as sexually liberated
as you are?

1110
01:25:00,195 --> 01:25:02,891
l couldn't compete.

1111
01:25:02,964 --> 01:25:06,422
You couldn't compete!
What was she possibly doing?

1112
01:25:06,501 --> 01:25:08,628
Using a razor blade?

1113
01:25:17,946 --> 01:25:20,414
He was in bed with another man.

1114
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:31,558
l never knew that about him.

1115
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:37,727
l felt betrayed.

1116
01:25:37,799 --> 01:25:40,927
l couldn't handle it,
so l left.

1117
01:25:43,304 --> 01:25:46,398
lt was easier for him to think
l left because of the money...

1118
01:25:46,508 --> 01:25:48,942
but l left
because l couldn't stay.

1119
01:25:50,578 --> 01:25:52,273
Mr. Roston isn't here
to defend himself.

1120
01:25:52,347 --> 01:25:53,473
You can say anything you want.

1121
01:25:53,548 --> 01:25:55,345
Yes, he is.

1122
01:25:59,687 --> 01:26:02,349
Ask him yourself.

1123
01:26:40,061 --> 01:26:41,688
No further questions.

1124
01:26:43,831 --> 01:26:45,799
Redirect, Mr. Dulaney?

1125
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:52,503
Your Honor, the defense rests.

1126
01:28:06,447 --> 01:28:08,574
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury...

1127
01:28:08,650 --> 01:28:11,551
in the case of the People
vs. Rebecca Carlson...

1128
01:28:11,619 --> 01:28:13,519
have you reached a verdict?

1129
01:28:13,588 --> 01:28:15,488
We have, Your Honor.

1130
01:28:29,637 --> 01:28:31,571
How do you find?

1131
01:28:31,673 --> 01:28:35,109
The jury finds the defendant...

1132
01:28:35,209 --> 01:28:37,109
not guilty.

1133
01:28:38,179 --> 01:28:40,238
The defendant is released.

1134
01:28:40,315 --> 01:28:42,180
This court is adjourned.

1135
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:52,016
-Thanks, Gabe.
-Nice going.

1136
01:29:03,838 --> 01:29:05,305
Thanks.

1137
01:29:06,374 --> 01:29:08,604
You almost convinced me.

1138
01:29:23,224 --> 01:29:26,057
Trial's over, Frank.

1139
01:29:26,127 --> 01:29:27,924
Walk away.

1140
01:29:57,992 --> 01:29:59,687
Stop whining.

1141
01:30:01,696 --> 01:30:06,759
You knew you were going
to blow your career.

1142
01:30:06,834 --> 01:30:09,598
l'm doing you a favor.

1143
01:30:09,704 --> 01:30:13,504
We will live happily ever after,
but not together.

1144
01:30:13,574 --> 01:30:14,905
lf you stick around me...

1145
01:30:14,976 --> 01:30:18,070
you'll get indicted
for perjury and murder.

1146
01:30:18,146 --> 01:30:21,172
l'm home free.
They can't try me twice...

1147
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:23,581
but you are a different story.

1148
01:30:28,856 --> 01:30:30,551
Shit!

1149
01:30:33,361 --> 01:30:34,760
He heard us.

1150
01:30:34,829 --> 01:30:36,922
He's my lawyer.
lt's privileged.

1151
01:30:36,998 --> 01:30:39,558
l'd have given you
the same goddamn defense.

1152
01:30:39,634 --> 01:30:41,226
But you wouldn't have been
as believable.

1153
01:30:41,302 --> 01:30:42,792
lf l didn't fuck you?

1154
01:30:42,904 --> 01:30:44,098
lt works.

1155
01:30:46,407 --> 01:30:47,567
You slept with him?

1156
01:30:47,675 --> 01:30:50,735
l don't think we ever slept,
did we, Frank?

1157
01:30:51,879 --> 01:30:53,847
Don't look so hurt, Alan.

1158
01:30:53,915 --> 01:30:56,475
l fucked you. l fucked Andrew.
l fucked Frank.

1159
01:30:56,551 --> 01:30:58,451
That's what l do. l fuck.

1160
01:30:58,519 --> 01:31:00,783
And it made me $8 million.

1161
01:31:00,855 --> 01:31:02,880
So you're fucking
Dr. Paley here...

1162
01:31:02,957 --> 01:31:04,891
and he mentions
a rich patient--

1163
01:31:04,959 --> 01:31:06,392
a rich, delicate patient--

1164
01:31:06,461 --> 01:31:09,225
and you figure you can
fuck yourself into the will.

1165
01:31:09,297 --> 01:31:10,457
You know how to do that.

1166
01:31:10,531 --> 01:31:12,089
l'm hard to resist.

1167
01:31:12,166 --> 01:31:14,566
The coke came from Dr. Paley,
didn't it?

1168
01:31:14,635 --> 01:31:16,626
Made it untraceable.

1169
01:31:16,737 --> 01:31:18,068
Why are you telling him?

1170
01:31:18,139 --> 01:31:19,800
He's telling us.

1171
01:31:19,907 --> 01:31:22,535
Fuck if you didn't
play me perfectly.

1172
01:31:22,610 --> 01:31:26,341
Paley goes on the stand,
makes you look guilty as hell.

1173
01:31:26,414 --> 01:31:27,608
Then you set me up
to destroy him...

1174
01:31:27,682 --> 01:31:29,343
so l can make you
look innocent.

1175
01:31:29,417 --> 01:31:32,215
Sort of a reverse
character witness.

1176
01:31:32,286 --> 01:31:34,447
You're a real genius.

1177
01:31:34,522 --> 01:31:36,820
Sorry l can't say
the same thing about you.

1178
01:31:36,891 --> 01:31:40,554
l always thought the message
on the answering machine...

1179
01:31:40,628 --> 01:31:43,324
was a little over the top,
but you even bought that.

1180
01:31:43,397 --> 01:31:46,594
What are you
doing here anyway...

1181
01:31:46,667 --> 01:31:49,636
ambulance chasing?

1182
01:31:49,704 --> 01:31:51,763
Looking for a new client?

1183
01:31:51,873 --> 01:31:54,706
Talk to Alan here.
He thinks he's in trouble.

1184
01:31:54,775 --> 01:31:57,209
You don't give a shit about me.

1185
01:31:57,278 --> 01:31:58,438
You're right.

1186
01:31:58,513 --> 01:32:00,481
l've forgotten you already.

1187
01:32:01,682 --> 01:32:03,946
l threw my life away for you!

1188
01:32:04,018 --> 01:32:06,111
Paley, what are you--

1189
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:07,745
l'll kill you!

1190
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:18,995
Stop it!

1191
01:32:20,568 --> 01:32:22,433
Paley!

1192
01:32:28,643 --> 01:32:29,871
Bitch!

1193
01:33:17,091 --> 01:33:18,422
Oh, God.

1194
01:33:31,005 --> 01:33:34,236
You're going to be all right.

1195
01:33:34,308 --> 01:33:36,742
Get me out of here, Frank.

1196
01:35:01,595 --> 01:35:04,120
Do you believe in karma, Frank?

1197
01:35:04,198 --> 01:35:05,597
No.

1198
01:35:07,268 --> 01:35:09,236
Whatever you call it...

1199
01:35:09,303 --> 01:35:12,636
people usually get
what they deserve...

1200
01:35:12,707 --> 01:35:14,641
except for lawyers.

1201
01:35:20,347 --> 01:35:23,316
You should have won the case.

1202
01:35:25,586 --> 01:35:27,281
l did.

1203
