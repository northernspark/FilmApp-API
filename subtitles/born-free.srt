00:04:13,831 --> 00:04:14,976
Pati!

3
00:04:17,895 --> 00:04:19,422
You monster.

4
00:04:19,816 --> 00:04:22,467
Nuru, don't leave the drinks
where Pati can get at them.

5
00:04:22,825 --> 00:04:25,672
I'm very sorry, Memsahib. That bad, Pati!

6
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,294
It's not really her fault.

7
00:04:27,465 --> 00:04:30,630
You're not supposed to put temptation
in the path of an alcoholic.

8
00:04:30,698 --> 00:04:33,994
She's not a.... She's a rock hyrax.

9
00:04:34,411 --> 00:04:38,186
Yes, and a disgrace to her species.
Anyway, we'll all have to be more careful.

10
00:04:38,252 --> 00:04:41,547
-I'm sure it can't be good for her.
-Yes, but she likes it.

11
00:04:42,188 --> 00:04:45,385
I Know. Now, where did I leave my paints?

12
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,046
Here, Memsahib.

13
00:04:49,261 --> 00:04:51,979
Thank you, Nuru. Will you take Pati?

14
00:04:52,878 --> 00:04:54,154
Thank you.

15
00:04:58,415 --> 00:05:00,270
Now, no more drinking.

16
00:05:19,698 --> 00:05:21,389
I am Joy Adamson...

17
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:25,104
...and for many years my home has been
in the northern province of Kenya...

18
00:05:25,203 --> 00:05:28,335
...where my husband, George,
was senior game warden.

19
00:05:30,805 --> 00:05:34,515
One of his duties was
to deal with dangerous animals...

20
00:05:34,581 --> 00:05:37,615
...who were a menace
to either human life or to crops.

21
00:05:37,718 --> 00:05:40,566
And we were on safari
in the Boran region...

22
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,630
...where a man-eating lion
had been reported.

23
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,987
Look out!

24
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,230
You've been very successful, haven't you?

25
00:07:40,331 --> 00:07:43,680
-Joy, can you spare a minute?
-Yes, I suppose so. What is it?

26
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:46,091
I've a little something for you.

27
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,472
-Do they belong to those two up there?
-Yes.

28
00:07:54,989 --> 00:07:56,899
We had to kill the mother.

29
00:07:57,007 --> 00:08:00,520
I'm sorry. She attacked us and
we didn't know why until it was too late.

30
00:08:00,591 --> 00:08:03,407
Poor little dears. Come here, darlings.

31
00:08:03,472 --> 00:08:04,584
Careful!

32
00:08:04,688 --> 00:08:09,610
One gave Sam a first-class scratch.
Not very good-tempered, are they?

33
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:13,162
Neither are you when you're hungry.
l don't suppose you've fed them.

34
00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:15,055
No, I can't say I have.

35
00:08:15,121 --> 00:08:18,155
You didn't pack any lion's milk
for me before I left.

36
00:08:18,258 --> 00:08:22,601
You didn't ask me.
Come on, darlings, never mind that brute.

37
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:25,803
We'll feed you.
We'll make you strong and healthy.

38
00:08:34,356 --> 00:08:35,600
Come on.

39
00:08:40,342 --> 00:08:43,157
Well, that wasn't a great success, was it?

40
00:08:43,766 --> 00:08:46,734
But why don't they?
lt's at least two days since they've eaten.

41
00:08:46,807 --> 00:08:48,269
-They'll just die.
-Yes, I Know.

42
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,896
It must be the formula.
We haven't hit on it yet.

43
00:08:50,968 --> 00:08:53,652
-We'll just have to try again.
-Right.

44
00:08:53,816 --> 00:08:56,118
Back to the drawing board. Formula....

45
00:08:56,217 --> 00:08:57,494
Thirteen.

46
00:09:01,338 --> 00:09:04,655
George, I've just been thinking
about the cod-liver oil.

47
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,421
Do you think we put too much in?

48
00:09:08,218 --> 00:09:12,758
Twenty-four hours Iater,
they were still refusing food of any kind.

49
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:16,565
They were actuaIIy dying of starvation
before our eyes.

50
00:09:25,245 --> 00:09:26,936
Formula seventeen.

51
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:31,773
To be perfectly honest, I'm beginning
to wish I hadn't brought them back.

52
00:09:56,579 --> 00:10:00,224
Come on, darling. Come on, sweetie.

53
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:09,181
What is it?
What are we going to do with you?

54
00:10:10,662 --> 00:10:12,485
Why won't you eat?

55
00:10:14,566 --> 00:10:16,574
Don't you see you'll die?

56
00:10:17,927 --> 00:10:21,757
Come on, baby,
there's a little sweetie baby.

57
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,419
My little sweeties.

58
00:10:24,776 --> 00:10:25,986
There.

59
00:10:27,048 --> 00:10:28,161
There.

60
00:11:10,064 --> 00:11:12,782
A little nap
and they'll be begging for more.

61
00:11:12,849 --> 00:11:14,256
Yes, thanks to Elsa.

62
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:16,009
Who?

63
00:11:16,145 --> 00:11:19,495
-The one who took the milk first.
-Oh, yes.

64
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:22,381
-But why "Elsa"?
-I don't know.

65
00:11:23,954 --> 00:11:25,645
Well, I suppose I do really.

66
00:11:25,747 --> 00:11:28,049
She reminds me of a little girl
I knew at school.

67
00:11:28,307 --> 00:11:31,057
She was the smallest of us all
and not good at games...

68
00:11:31,156 --> 00:11:34,702
...but she was bright and brave and good,
and I liked her very much.

69
00:11:34,772 --> 00:11:37,424
-Her name was Elsa.
-Fair enough.

70
00:11:38,261 --> 00:11:41,709
You're wonderful, too, darling.
After all, you're the one that did it.

71
00:11:41,782 --> 00:11:45,558
Why, sure.
They said I couldn't do it, but I did it.

72
00:11:46,423 --> 00:11:50,614
Formula seventeen. You're a genius.
You really ought to put it on the market.

73
00:11:50,712 --> 00:11:51,726
No.

74
00:11:52,151 --> 00:11:56,178
You see, it would never work
without one special ingredient. This.

75
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:00,113
I'm not putting that on the market.

76
00:12:03,194 --> 00:12:06,228
Even as babies,
each had a different character.

77
00:12:06,395 --> 00:12:08,664
The largest one,
we called her the "Big One"...

78
00:12:08,763 --> 00:12:11,032
...was vain of her size and strength.

79
00:12:11,099 --> 00:12:14,612
The second largest, Lastika,
was the clown of the three.

80
00:12:15,996 --> 00:12:19,313
But my favorite, of course,
was the smallest, EIsa.

81
00:12:19,421 --> 00:12:22,421
A weakling in size
but the bravest of them all...

82
00:12:22,525 --> 00:12:25,460
...she loved to expIore
and investigate and examine.

83
00:12:25,565 --> 00:12:27,671
And there were no limits to her curiosity.

84
00:12:27,742 --> 00:12:31,485
In the wild, she would have been
the throw-out of the pride...

85
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:34,399
...for the smallest cub in a Iitter
rarely survives.

86
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:36,984
But Elsa had no inferiority complex.

87
00:12:40,288 --> 00:12:42,460
AII the cubs were, naturally, housetrained...

88
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:45,725
...and always took great care
to reach the sandboxes outside.

89
00:12:45,793 --> 00:12:49,591
But, also naturally, there were
a few accidents in the early days...

90
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:53,015
...and when these happened,
they were most embarrassed.

91
00:13:02,244 --> 00:13:06,467
Unfortunately for Pati,
very soon the cubs were too Iarge for her.

92
00:14:07,087 --> 00:14:10,765
At three months oId, their teeth
were big enough for them to eat meat.

93
00:14:11,152 --> 00:14:15,277
And this soon meant that poor Iittle Elsa
never got her fair share.

94
00:14:20,754 --> 00:14:23,089
So I kept the best bits for her.

95
00:14:23,218 --> 00:14:26,186
George said he was convinced
Elsa thought I was her mother.

96
00:14:27,571 --> 00:14:31,249
Whatever she thought, she made me happy
by following me everywhere...

97
00:14:31,316 --> 00:14:34,284
...and keeping me company
whiIe George was away.

98
00:14:36,885 --> 00:14:39,700
When they grew older
and needed more room to play...

99
00:14:39,766 --> 00:14:42,518
...we put Nuru in charge of them,
and they got along beautifully.

100
00:14:53,752 --> 00:14:54,930
Elsa!

101
00:14:55,288 --> 00:14:57,328
What are you doing? Go away!

102
00:14:57,401 --> 00:14:59,408
Go! Get away!

103
00:15:11,835 --> 00:15:16,113
Getting them out of their cage for their
morning exercise was never a probIem.

104
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,594
Come on, babies.

105
00:15:22,365 --> 00:15:24,471
But putting them to bed was another story.

106
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:26,484
Come back!

107
00:15:28,926 --> 00:15:31,480
-Come back, Big One.
-Come on, Big One.

108
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,200
Come back, Elsa!

109
00:15:34,527 --> 00:15:35,804
In you go!

110
00:15:37,535 --> 00:15:39,194
Come on. That's it.

111
00:15:41,121 --> 00:15:42,615
Come on. Inside.

112
00:15:45,057 --> 00:15:47,097
And you. There!

113
00:16:17,703 --> 00:16:21,119
Eventually, we had to ban them entireIy
from the house.

114
00:16:32,137 --> 00:16:35,138
To make it up to them,
we hung an old tire from a tree...

115
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:38,244
...and Elsa particularly fell in Iove with it.

116
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:47,492
They're beginning to look like lions now.

117
00:16:47,564 --> 00:16:50,499
Yes, and to behave like them, too.

118
00:16:51,501 --> 00:16:54,283
Don't I remember
the father was a man-eater?

119
00:16:54,989 --> 00:16:58,820
You don't believe that man-eating
is an inherited trait, do you?

120
00:16:59,022 --> 00:17:01,444
I don't think anyone really knows.

121
00:17:04,751 --> 00:17:09,422
I hope you're ready for lunch, 'cause I am.
And hungry enough to eat a hyena.

122
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:13,067
John's just wondering if your cubs
might start eating people one day.

123
00:17:13,137 --> 00:17:16,967
You're joking, of course.
You know my lions are perfect little angels.

124
00:17:17,073 --> 00:17:19,245
Yes, but they'll be very large angels soon.

125
00:17:19,346 --> 00:17:22,575
Isn't it about time you thought
of shipping them off to a zoo?

126
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:24,584
Is that an order, John?

127
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:28,685
You're touchy. Have you been feeding him
that lion's milk he's famous for?

128
00:17:28,787 --> 00:17:31,657
Of course it's not an order.
But it's a good idea, isn't it?

129
00:17:31,732 --> 00:17:33,107
Yes, of course, you're right.

130
00:17:33,172 --> 00:17:35,889
We've already arranged to send them
to Rotterdam Zoo.

131
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:38,378
-We're not ecstatic about it.
-Why? lt's excellent.

132
00:17:38,453 --> 00:17:40,209
He means we're going to miss them.

133
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,731
I know I will, terribly.
Particularly one of them.

134
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:46,445
Of course you will.
They're absolutely loveable at this age.

135
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:49,804
-Forgot to shut the gates.
-Heaven help the house. Hurry!

136
00:17:49,911 --> 00:17:51,253
Perfect little angels!

137
00:18:03,353 --> 00:18:05,394
John, be a dear and get hold of Elsa.

138
00:18:05,466 --> 00:18:08,532
-Be careful, she's not very strong.
-Neither am I.

139
00:18:09,146 --> 00:18:11,186
No, you don't understand. She's delicate.

140
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:13,299
So am I. Let George fetch her.

141
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:19,351
Would you mind keeping your eye on her?
We'll be back in a moment.

142
00:18:22,557 --> 00:18:25,208
All right, my delicate one. Here I come.

143
00:18:27,262 --> 00:18:31,059
-Joy, would you go back and fetch Elsa?
-Yes. I hope John doesn't scare her.

144
00:18:31,134 --> 00:18:32,149
Steady.

145
00:18:41,824 --> 00:18:43,767
Elsa, you naughty girl.

146
00:18:43,937 --> 00:18:46,807
Don't you understand? He's the boss.

147
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,376
I'm sorry, John,
you must have frightened her.

148
00:18:49,506 --> 00:18:51,197
Come on, come on, darling.

149
00:18:51,266 --> 00:18:54,266
You mustn't be afraid of John.
He likes lions.

150
00:18:57,699 --> 00:19:00,667
AII too soon, we received word
from the Rotterdam Zoo...

151
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:02,943
...that it was ready to receive the cubs.

152
00:19:03,044 --> 00:19:04,899
We padded and wired the truck.

153
00:19:08,869 --> 00:19:11,390
And each day we took them out
for a long ride...

154
00:19:11,461 --> 00:19:16,034
...in order to prepare them
for the 180-miIe trip to the Nairobi airfieId.

155
00:19:26,728 --> 00:19:29,117
I wouId leave Pati behind on these rides.

156
00:19:29,192 --> 00:19:32,804
She was getting old now,
and I kept her as quiet as possibIe.

157
00:19:33,993 --> 00:19:36,896
-Look after Pati for me, Nuru.
-Yes, Memsahib.

158
00:19:42,123 --> 00:19:44,262
-All right, darling?
-Yes, fine.

159
00:20:30,003 --> 00:20:32,043
-Memsahib. Pati....
-What's happened?

160
00:20:32,115 --> 00:20:35,465
She's very sick, I think from heat.
I think she die.

161
00:21:06,681 --> 00:21:08,056
She's dead.

162
00:21:14,939 --> 00:21:17,525
When the day
that I had been dreading came...

163
00:21:17,595 --> 00:21:20,116
...I went for a last waIk with Elsa.

164
00:21:26,397 --> 00:21:27,575
Elsa?

165
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:40,601
There you are. Come on.

166
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,972
Come on, come on down.

167
00:21:43,488 --> 00:21:45,376
This way. Come on.

168
00:21:59,683 --> 00:22:00,992
Elsa, no!

169
00:22:03,492 --> 00:22:05,052
Come away. Please!

170
00:22:12,997 --> 00:22:16,576
Thank you, darling. That's a good girl.

171
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:35,395
If it's any consolation,
I feel as rotten about it as you do.

172
00:22:35,498 --> 00:22:39,557
George, I think I ought to tell you
that just now Elsa....

173
00:22:40,298 --> 00:22:41,793
What about her?

174
00:22:42,379 --> 00:22:43,786
Nothing.

175
00:22:46,668 --> 00:22:48,937
Come on, love. Come on.

176
00:22:49,772 --> 00:22:51,365
There you go, my sweetie.

177
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:02,086
-l suppose we do have to send them off.
-Yes.

178
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,655
All of them?

179
00:23:03,726 --> 00:23:05,253
Yes, even Elsa.

180
00:23:06,542 --> 00:23:10,405
Even if I told you that she just stopped me
from walking into a great big cobra...

181
00:23:10,512 --> 00:23:12,901
...and that she knew what she was doing?

182
00:23:15,856 --> 00:23:18,191
I'm sorry, it wasn't fair to ask.

183
00:23:20,113 --> 00:23:22,929
Let's get the show on the road,
as they say.

184
00:24:52,834 --> 00:24:56,412
-Would you mind if I did some shopping?
-No, good idea.

185
00:25:04,676 --> 00:25:07,043
-Can you cope?
-Yes, I think so.

186
00:25:07,461 --> 00:25:09,763
I'll meet you outside Ahmed's.

187
00:25:10,469 --> 00:25:13,120
-How will you get there?
-In a taxi.

188
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,832
I know it's silly.
I know she's not a human being.

189
00:26:30,931 --> 00:26:35,023
I know she's just a lion, but I wish
I could stop feeling so miserable.

190
00:26:35,124 --> 00:26:36,400
You will.

191
00:26:36,788 --> 00:26:40,105
No, I'm just a fool.
I'm going to miss her terribly.

192
00:26:40,597 --> 00:26:42,353
You won't, you know.

193
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:48,564
Elsa, sweetie.

194
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:55,956
Darling, thank you. Thank you very much.

195
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:15,203
-Hello, George!
-Hello, John.

196
00:28:16,006 --> 00:28:18,243
Good afternoon, Bwana Kendall.

197
00:28:19,494 --> 00:28:22,430
-Where's Elsa?
-Elsa's not out here today.

198
00:28:23,239 --> 00:28:24,352
Good.

199
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,069
-How's Bwana George?
-Much better now.

200
00:28:27,176 --> 00:28:30,525
But that malaria was very bad.
Good thing he has strong medicine.

201
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,251
Yes. Well, you don't look too bad.

202
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,131
I boxed with Nuru before breakfast,
and earned a draw.

203
00:28:36,201 --> 00:28:37,445
Good.

204
00:28:37,705 --> 00:28:41,219
-Marvelous stuff, these malaria pills.
-Yes, if you don't overdo it.

205
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:43,810
I'm feeling fine.
Well enough for Joy to go out...

206
00:28:43,882 --> 00:28:46,185
...and you Know she wouldn't go
if I wasn't fit.

207
00:28:46,251 --> 00:28:47,680
Quite. What's she up to?

208
00:28:47,787 --> 00:28:49,446
Having the Land Rover checked.

209
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:53,094
And in case you're wondering,
Elsa's with her.

210
00:28:56,461 --> 00:28:59,974
I don't understand why everyone assumes
that Elsa and I have a feud.

211
00:29:00,045 --> 00:29:01,474
-Help yourself.
-Thank you.

212
00:29:01,742 --> 00:29:05,256
Actually, George,
I wanted to talk to you about another lion.

213
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:08,710
You know, the one that's been snatching
all those goats down in Kiunga.

214
00:29:08,815 --> 00:29:12,012
I don't see why you have to travel
all that way in your condition.

215
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:13,989
Why don't I send Ken, or one of the others?

216
00:29:14,224 --> 00:29:18,316
No, I think I'd like some sea air.
If you can wait until I feel a bit stronger.

217
00:29:18,417 --> 00:29:20,457
I don't mind. A change would do you good.

218
00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:23,563
But don't overdo it, will you?
The best cure for malaria is rest.

219
00:29:23,666 --> 00:29:26,962
I take your point, John.
II'll rest. I promise you.

220
00:29:34,611 --> 00:29:36,619
-Here, isn't that....
-Yes.

221
00:29:47,445 --> 00:29:48,787
Come on, Elsa.

222
00:29:49,686 --> 00:29:51,726
Come on down. Ride's over.

223
00:29:54,006 --> 00:29:56,211
Hurry up. Let's go and see how George is.

224
00:29:57,528 --> 00:30:00,016
Hello, John, how nice of you to drop in.

225
00:30:00,088 --> 00:30:01,746
-Here's some letters for you.
-Thanks.

226
00:30:01,816 --> 00:30:03,027
-How are you?
-Fine.

227
00:30:03,097 --> 00:30:03,893
Good.

228
00:30:04,185 --> 00:30:06,935
-Boxed six rounds with John this morning.
-Earned a draw.

229
00:30:07,033 --> 00:30:09,969
How does it feel to live with
the boxing champion of the world?

230
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:14,068
Marvelous. We boxed two rounds
this morning and I knocked him out.

231
00:30:14,586 --> 00:30:17,304
Can you stay to dinner?
Or, better still, stay the night.

232
00:30:17,371 --> 00:30:20,088
-I can do both.
-Good. I'll just go and warn the cook.

233
00:30:21,436 --> 00:30:23,924
Poor darling, I've hurt her feelings.

234
00:30:24,732 --> 00:30:25,747
Joy!

235
00:30:29,149 --> 00:30:31,419
Hello, Elsa. Have a nice drive?

236
00:30:33,054 --> 00:30:34,745
-Stop it, Elsa.
-Hello, Elsa.

237
00:30:34,814 --> 00:30:36,156
Get down.

238
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:39,096
Why don't you go and say hello to John?

239
00:30:40,703 --> 00:30:42,710
You know, I think I'm being snubbed.

240
00:30:42,783 --> 00:30:44,758
-Now stop it, Elsa.
-I hope.

241
00:30:44,864 --> 00:30:48,410
You're getting heavy, Elsa.
Stop it, you're squashing me.

242
00:30:55,906 --> 00:30:58,362
Now, the question is:
What have I forgotten?

243
00:30:58,466 --> 00:31:01,369
Tell you what I've forgotten.
I'm almost out of malaria pills.

244
00:31:01,474 --> 00:31:03,547
Right. Goodbye, darling.

245
00:31:03,747 --> 00:31:06,431
Look after yourself. And no boxing.

246
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,540
I wouldn't dream of such a thing.

247
00:31:08,612 --> 00:31:11,231
-Goodbye, John. Lovely to see you.
-Thank you.

248
00:31:11,301 --> 00:31:14,203
Now I must say goodbye to Elsa.
Where is she?

249
00:31:14,469 --> 00:31:15,778
On her car.

250
00:31:23,271 --> 00:31:26,500
Elsa, I told you
you couldn't go to Nairobi with me.

251
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:28,771
Have you met my wife who talks to lions?

252
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:32,419
Please, come down. Elsa.

253
00:31:34,024 --> 00:31:37,407
-I'm afraid you'll have to help me, Father.
-Good old Dad.

254
00:31:37,705 --> 00:31:40,094
Elsa, don't be such a lunatic. Get down!

255
00:31:40,362 --> 00:31:41,474
Get down!

256
00:31:42,794 --> 00:31:44,038
Come on!

257
00:31:44,298 --> 00:31:46,153
Come on! Good girl.

258
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:03,110
Will you have another cup of coffee
before you go off?

259
00:32:03,181 --> 00:32:04,676
No, thank you.

260
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:07,657
What will you do with Elsa
while you're away in Kiunga?

261
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,068
We'll take her with us...

262
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:11,556
...unless you care to board her
till we get back.

263
00:32:11,631 --> 00:32:13,060
No, thank you.

264
00:32:13,168 --> 00:32:16,714
You know, you're as much her prisoner
as she is yours.

265
00:32:17,104 --> 00:32:19,822
She's not a prisoner. She's a friend.

266
00:32:19,921 --> 00:32:21,263
Yes, I know.

267
00:32:21,361 --> 00:32:25,519
And there's probably no harm in taking her
on a short trip, with reasonable care.

268
00:32:25,586 --> 00:32:27,920
But your long leave is due soon.

269
00:32:28,114 --> 00:32:30,700
Are you planning on taking her
to England for a year?

270
00:32:30,803 --> 00:32:34,415
No, it's a problem.
I've meant to talk to Joy about it, but...

271
00:32:34,515 --> 00:32:36,719
...I suppose I've been waiting.

272
00:32:37,268 --> 00:32:38,894
Don't wait too long.

273
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:41,680
Look after yourself.

274
00:32:50,198 --> 00:32:52,500
Come on, lunatic.
You're blocking the road.

275
00:32:52,598 --> 00:32:54,420
John wants to go home.

276
00:32:56,343 --> 00:32:57,358
All clear, John.

277
00:32:58,583 --> 00:32:59,925
Thank you.

278
00:33:14,523 --> 00:33:18,266
Now, look, Joy will be back tomorrow.
You can't stay here all night.

279
00:33:19,067 --> 00:33:21,883
Damn it!
Now you've got me talking to you.

280
00:33:22,492 --> 00:33:25,558
Look, she'll be back tomorrow.
I promise you.

281
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,968
Elsa, go away.
Don't you sneak up on me like that.

282
00:33:47,296 --> 00:33:49,401
It's very unpleasant.

283
00:33:50,816 --> 00:33:52,988
Elsa, get down, you idiot.

284
00:33:55,777 --> 00:33:57,207
l don't know.

285
00:34:04,804 --> 00:34:06,592
Stop playing about.

286
00:34:07,524 --> 00:34:09,466
Kindly give me the towel.

287
00:34:10,917 --> 00:34:12,291
Thank you.

288
00:34:17,478 --> 00:34:21,951
Now let's have my dressing gown back.
Come on. Give it to me.

289
00:34:22,247 --> 00:34:23,709
Right away.

290
00:34:25,415 --> 00:34:27,041
Go on, push off!

291
00:35:31,731 --> 00:35:34,546
Hello, Elsa.
Did you look after George for me?

292
00:35:39,828 --> 00:35:41,617
-Hello, darling.
-Hello, George.

293
00:35:41,748 --> 00:35:44,050
-Good trip?
-Not bad. A bit dusty.

294
00:35:44,149 --> 00:35:46,484
-How's Elsa?
-She missed her mom.

295
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:50,803
l did my best as a babysitter,
but I'm afraid I'm not the type.

296
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:54,449
Do you Know, she sat out here
all night long waiting for you?

297
00:35:54,551 --> 00:35:57,169
Poor thing. And poor you, too, darling.

298
00:35:57,304 --> 00:35:58,765
Come on, Elsa.

299
00:35:59,928 --> 00:36:02,295
I'll find something nice for you.

300
00:36:05,689 --> 00:36:08,340
George seemed so recovered
from his attack of malaria...

301
00:36:08,409 --> 00:36:10,646
...that we left for Kiunga
the very next day...

302
00:36:10,746 --> 00:36:14,675
...wondering how Elsa wouId react
to the sight of her first ocean.

303
00:36:32,381 --> 00:36:34,454
We reached Kiunga too late for anything...

304
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:37,308
...except to make camp
and then meet the local fishermen...

305
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:42,045
...who had come to tell George about their
troubles with the lion killing their goats.

306
00:36:42,143 --> 00:36:46,748
Under the circumstances, Elsa's presence
seemed to puzzIe them considerabIy.

307
00:37:06,147 --> 00:37:08,864
We were tired
and had fallen asleep quickIy.

308
00:37:09,156 --> 00:37:13,499
But I was awakened by noises
coming from near the cars and the kitchen.

309
00:37:13,637 --> 00:37:16,255
There was no doubt that our cars,
or our food...

310
00:37:16,357 --> 00:37:19,489
...were providing
a great temptation to someone.

311
00:37:23,014 --> 00:37:24,705
I didn't want to wake George.

312
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:27,907
He had looked so tired and paIe
when we arrived.

313
00:38:56,247 --> 00:38:58,190
-George. George!
-What is it?

314
00:38:58,263 --> 00:39:01,744
There's a lion out there.
l think it's John's goat-eater.

315
00:39:02,104 --> 00:39:05,072
Don't be silly.
No lion would come into camp.

316
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,117
lt's probably a hyena,
or a leopard or something.

317
00:39:08,185 --> 00:39:12,179
No, it's a lion. I saw it.
l was out there by the cook tent.

318
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,919
What were you doing....

319
00:39:18,555 --> 00:39:19,831
All right.

320
00:39:20,731 --> 00:39:22,225
Go back to bed.

321
00:40:55,756 --> 00:40:57,185
Did you see him?

322
00:40:57,292 --> 00:41:00,042
Yes, I saw him. Go to sleep.

323
00:41:07,406 --> 00:41:09,162
Well, what happened?

324
00:41:09,518 --> 00:41:12,366
I'd rather not discuss it. Go to sleep.

325
00:41:24,593 --> 00:41:26,317
What are you doing?

326
00:41:27,249 --> 00:41:29,191
Getting a drink of water.

327
00:41:30,162 --> 00:41:33,032
Look, will you or will you not go to sleep?

328
00:42:56,929 --> 00:42:59,865
That's that.
Work finished ahead of schedule.

329
00:43:00,674 --> 00:43:02,617
From tomorrow, we play.

330
00:43:05,475 --> 00:43:07,614
Marvelous watchdog you are!

331
00:43:32,008 --> 00:43:34,528
ImmediateIy after our first waIk
along the beach...

332
00:43:34,632 --> 00:43:39,455
...we all trooped down to the water's edge
to introduce EIsa to the Indian Ocean.

333
00:43:39,593 --> 00:43:42,627
At first she was put off by the growl
and rush of the waves...

334
00:43:42,697 --> 00:43:44,388
...and the taste of the water.

335
00:43:44,457 --> 00:43:46,825
And perhaps,
by the audience we had collected...

336
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:49,890
...and which was looking on
from a safe distance.

337
00:43:51,627 --> 00:43:53,929
But soon her characteristic curiosity
prevaiIed...

338
00:43:54,027 --> 00:43:56,613
...and she enjoyed herseIf tremendousIy.

339
00:44:59,895 --> 00:45:03,092
She loved playing
almost any game George invented.

340
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:08,434
At the same time, she exhibited a talent
for foothall that none of us had suspected.

341
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:39,703
It was a marvelous holiday.

342
00:45:40,286 --> 00:45:43,036
Until one afternoon,
Nuru came panting down the beach...

343
00:45:43,103 --> 00:45:46,420
...to tell me that something
was terribIy wrong with Bwana George.

344
00:45:46,527 --> 00:45:48,316
I ran to our camp.

345
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,269
Let me get the pills.

346
00:45:55,905 --> 00:45:56,919
Joy!

347
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:02,397
Here, it's all right, darling.

348
00:46:02,466 --> 00:46:03,578
It's all right!

349
00:46:05,475 --> 00:46:06,587
Lie down.

350
00:46:06,723 --> 00:46:09,822
There, that's all right. Just give me those.

351
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,677
Yes, you see, medicine can be very good...

352
00:46:36,777 --> 00:46:40,160
...but too much medicine can be very bad,
and he has taken too much...

353
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:42,239
...and he has been too active, too soon.

354
00:46:42,409 --> 00:46:46,152
He might very well have died, you see.
Indeed, I'm surprised that he did not.

355
00:46:46,346 --> 00:46:49,281
Goggle fishing too soon, too soon.

356
00:46:49,834 --> 00:46:51,842
He seems to be an impetuous man.

357
00:46:51,915 --> 00:46:54,785
True. He's a mad, impetuous boy.

358
00:46:55,595 --> 00:46:58,279
Then we must curb his impetuosity.
No more goggling.

359
00:46:58,572 --> 00:47:01,190
No. He must rest
and then he will get well.

360
00:47:01,292 --> 00:47:02,951
We'll see to it, Doctor.

361
00:47:03,245 --> 00:47:05,995
Elsa will look after him.
She's a wonderful watchdog.

362
00:47:06,093 --> 00:47:08,712
Yes. I see what you mean.

363
00:47:08,814 --> 00:47:09,829
Goodbye.

364
00:47:09,934 --> 00:47:12,073
-Thank you very much.
-Good luck.

365
00:47:12,174 --> 00:47:14,149
You mad, impetuous boy.

366
00:47:28,433 --> 00:47:32,078
Like all hoIidays,
ours was over all too soon.

367
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,850
And it was the last
we wouId ever take together.

368
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:54,448
The time was approaching
when our Iives would be changed forever.

369
00:47:57,334 --> 00:47:59,309
Elsa was fully grown now.

370
00:47:59,639 --> 00:48:03,917
She had already been in season
and was capabIe of having her own cubs...

371
00:48:04,375 --> 00:48:07,093
...and she started to realize
there was another life...

372
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,943
...than the one
we had been living together.

373
00:48:26,332 --> 00:48:29,300
A little later, our troubIes began.

374
00:48:41,662 --> 00:48:42,939
You okay?

375
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:05,371
Sorry, but I Know that lioness.
She's a friend of mine.

376
00:49:07,971 --> 00:49:10,077
-You're certain she's all right?
-Completely.

377
00:49:10,179 --> 00:49:12,601
She and her friend Nuru
came over to say hello...

378
00:49:12,708 --> 00:49:16,418
...and then went on for a walk.
But it's a good thing I spotted her collar...

379
00:49:16,484 --> 00:49:18,874
...or Mr. Watson might have claimed
his first bag.

380
00:49:19,013 --> 00:49:21,380
I'm sorry, Mrs. Adamson, I didn't know.

381
00:49:21,445 --> 00:49:24,926
After all, you don't see a lion
sitting in a tree every day.

382
00:49:25,702 --> 00:49:26,979
No, I suppose not.

383
00:49:27,046 --> 00:49:29,086
Actually, we're looking for elephants.

384
00:49:29,191 --> 00:49:31,264
I've got my heart set
on getting an elephant.

385
00:49:31,687 --> 00:49:34,818
Well, we do get elephants here,
but not for shooting.

386
00:49:35,015 --> 00:49:36,160
l don't understand.

387
00:49:36,296 --> 00:49:38,947
They come each year
for the maize and Brussels sprouts...

388
00:49:39,016 --> 00:49:41,886
...which they love,
and they're usually quite well-behaved.

389
00:49:41,992 --> 00:49:44,229
They fascinate Elsa, I'm sorry to say.

390
00:49:44,425 --> 00:49:46,181
This is elephant season now.

391
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:48,552
Really? Do you think
we might get to see some?

392
00:49:48,746 --> 00:49:50,470
l shouldn't be surprised.

393
00:50:26,609 --> 00:50:29,327
Memsahib, Elsa playing with the elephants.

394
00:50:29,425 --> 00:50:30,440
Many elephants.

395
00:50:30,705 --> 00:50:33,935
No. Sorry. Come along
if you want to see some elephants.

396
00:50:34,034 --> 00:50:35,082
Good.

397
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:38,190
Remember, they're just for looking at.

398
00:50:38,259 --> 00:50:41,904
-No shooting unless it's necessary.
-l know. But let's go.

399
00:50:45,972 --> 00:50:48,306
Come in the back, there's more room.

400
00:50:51,861 --> 00:50:53,105
Okay!

401
00:51:36,829 --> 00:51:40,507
A few moments Iater, when we passed
through the shambles of a village...

402
00:51:40,606 --> 00:51:44,632
...we saw one of the resuIts
of Elsa's "playing" with the elephants.

403
00:51:44,927 --> 00:51:49,183
As bad as it was, it was a great relief
to learn that no one had been hurt.

404
00:51:49,311 --> 00:51:50,872
But now I was dreadfuIIy afraid...

405
00:51:50,944 --> 00:51:54,556
...that Elsa might have been trampIed
by some angry eIephant.

406
00:51:59,233 --> 00:52:00,760
And then we saw her...

407
00:52:00,833 --> 00:52:05,024
...very happiIy bringing home
a two-year-old souvenir of the occasion.

408
00:52:55,467 --> 00:52:58,250
And the damage, I'm sorry to say,
is considerable.

409
00:52:58,316 --> 00:53:01,961
The complaints and bills for crop damage,
et cetera, are still coming in...

410
00:53:02,028 --> 00:53:04,068
...and will do so for some time to come.

411
00:53:04,173 --> 00:53:08,330
The point is, I'm afraid,
that you can't keep Elsa any longer.

412
00:53:08,653 --> 00:53:11,239
I'm not responsible for the decision.
Don't you see?

413
00:53:11,309 --> 00:53:13,961
Too many people know
she was the cause of the stampede...

414
00:53:14,031 --> 00:53:17,348
...and from now on she'll be blamed
for any lost livestock or damage.

415
00:53:17,615 --> 00:53:21,129
Or for anything that any wild lion
or leopard might do.

416
00:53:21,488 --> 00:53:24,652
On the other hand,
she might very easily be shot by anyone.

417
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,663
I think you were lucky the last time.

418
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:29,936
She's too big now
to be allowed to roam about...

419
00:53:30,002 --> 00:53:34,258
...even with Nuru or yourselves.
And you can't keep her caged all the time...

420
00:53:34,322 --> 00:53:37,388
...that would only frustrate her
and could make her vicious.

421
00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:41,233
I'm sorry, but I think you've got to find
some zoo that will take her.

422
00:53:41,331 --> 00:53:45,008
I'm certain you'll have no difficulty.
She'd make a wonderful attraction.

423
00:53:45,076 --> 00:53:47,312
Well, we've always known that she....

424
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,133
John...

425
00:53:49,557 --> 00:53:51,412
...I'm sure we can solve this in time.

426
00:53:51,573 --> 00:53:54,541
That's the point, my dear.
There isn't very much time.

427
00:53:54,646 --> 00:53:56,555
Your long leave has come through.

428
00:53:56,630 --> 00:53:57,678
How soon?

429
00:53:57,750 --> 00:53:59,179
In a month. So, you see....

430
00:53:59,286 --> 00:54:02,069
Well, why couldn't we take it here,
in this country?

431
00:54:02,167 --> 00:54:04,054
-George wouldn't mind, right, dear?
-No.

432
00:54:04,216 --> 00:54:05,230
Then we could have time--

433
00:54:05,335 --> 00:54:08,303
You know government policies
for a completely different climate.

434
00:54:08,408 --> 00:54:11,671
I'm certain we could easily find
a good zoo for her in a month.

435
00:54:11,768 --> 00:54:16,112
I don't want her to go to a zoo.
I want to set her free.

436
00:54:17,209 --> 00:54:20,374
You can't be serious.
You'd be sentencing her to death.

437
00:54:20,442 --> 00:54:22,384
You might just as well shoot her here.

438
00:54:22,490 --> 00:54:24,630
He's right. She can't fend for herself.

439
00:54:24,731 --> 00:54:28,081
She's never killed to eat.
She'd starve out there in the bush.

440
00:54:28,156 --> 00:54:29,432
We could teach her.

441
00:54:29,532 --> 00:54:32,380
You've waited too long.
lt's never been done successfully.

442
00:54:32,444 --> 00:54:35,445
We could try.
You know how intelligent she is.

443
00:54:35,901 --> 00:54:39,993
We could teach her, train her.
George, please, let's try.

444
00:54:40,317 --> 00:54:42,652
I'm sorry, darling. I agree with John.

445
00:54:42,718 --> 00:54:45,108
Even if we could show her
how to hunt and kill...

446
00:54:45,214 --> 00:54:48,084
...she'd never hold her own
against wild lions.

447
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:51,133
I don't want to part with her
any more than you do.

448
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,753
But what's wrong
with sending her to a zoo?

449
00:54:53,856 --> 00:54:55,198
Everything.

450
00:54:56,576 --> 00:55:00,221
I know you think I'm being foolish,
but I know Elsa.

451
00:55:00,769 --> 00:55:03,486
We both know she'd be miserable in a zoo.

452
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,850
Don't you see? She's been free too long.

453
00:55:05,922 --> 00:55:09,086
I can't let her be caged
for the rest of her life.

454
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:14,141
John, as a friend,
give us just a little more time.

455
00:55:14,211 --> 00:55:17,987
Give us three months to try.

456
00:55:19,588 --> 00:55:20,734
Please!

457
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:30,048
Please!

458
00:55:31,846 --> 00:55:34,465
All right, my dear,
I'll get you your three months.

459
00:55:34,535 --> 00:55:36,640
But you're wasting your time.

460
00:55:38,696 --> 00:55:41,958
-Could I have another drink, please?
-Yes, of course.

461
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:51,622
If Elsa were to go wiId,
it wouId have to be in another district...

462
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:56,034
...and we were able to get permission
to take her to a reserve 340 miIes away...

463
00:55:56,363 --> 00:55:59,876
...where there was abundant game,
and best of all, many Iions.

464
00:56:03,373 --> 00:56:07,465
Whatever George's reservations were,
he did his best not to Iet me see them.

465
00:56:07,533 --> 00:56:09,475
And I was gratefuI to him.

466
00:56:53,173 --> 00:56:55,148
Our plan was to spend the first week...

467
00:56:55,222 --> 00:56:58,124
...taking Elsa around the new country
to get her used to it.

468
00:56:58,230 --> 00:57:01,613
During the second week,
we intended to leave her overnight...

469
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:05,296
...and to visit, and, if necessary,
feed her in the mornings.

470
00:57:05,399 --> 00:57:07,668
Afterwards,
we intended to reduce her meaIs...

471
00:57:07,736 --> 00:57:12,276
...in the hope that it wouId encourage her
to kill on her own or to join a wild Iion.

472
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:15,379
Elsa, what are you doing?
That is not your dinner.

473
00:57:15,481 --> 00:57:16,463
Put that back.

474
00:57:17,113 --> 00:57:18,869
On schedule, the day came...

475
00:57:18,937 --> 00:57:22,615
...when we took her out
to leave her overnight for the first time.

476
00:57:28,539 --> 00:57:30,481
Come on, Elsa, up you get.

477
00:57:30,876 --> 00:57:32,086
Come on.

478
00:57:32,636 --> 00:57:34,010
Come on. Today's the day.

479
00:57:52,191 --> 00:57:54,493
If that's what I think it is....

480
00:57:59,425 --> 00:58:00,570
Thanks.

481
00:58:06,306 --> 00:58:09,536
Crikey. What a bit of lucK.
Right off the bat.

482
00:58:10,434 --> 00:58:12,377
What a handsome fellow.

483
00:58:13,123 --> 00:58:15,425
Let's keep our fingers crossed.

484
00:58:20,069 --> 00:58:22,011
This could solve everything.

485
00:58:22,117 --> 00:58:26,111
-Do you believe in love at first sight?
-I do now. I mean, I hope so.

486
00:58:26,182 --> 00:58:28,189
-George, pray!
-I am!

487
00:58:56,970 --> 00:58:58,465
So far, so good.

488
00:58:59,115 --> 00:59:00,490
Why don't you get her down?

489
00:59:00,555 --> 00:59:03,206
I think we should let her handle this.

490
00:59:21,072 --> 00:59:24,236
All talk and no action.
Beautiful dialogue, though.

491
00:59:24,688 --> 00:59:27,917
You're not funny, George.
I mean, we should give her more time.

492
00:59:27,985 --> 00:59:30,636
-By all means. May I smoke?
-No.

493
00:59:44,916 --> 00:59:48,910
This could go on forever.
I think you'd better get her down.

494
00:59:50,644 --> 00:59:51,921
All right.

495
00:59:51,989 --> 00:59:55,121
Wait!
We could use a little more room ourselves.

496
01:00:13,017 --> 01:00:15,635
Come on, darling, get down.
Don't be afraid.

497
01:00:16,313 --> 01:00:18,004
I'm sure you'll like him.

498
01:00:18,618 --> 01:00:22,033
Come on, Elsa, get down.

499
01:01:56,203 --> 01:01:57,796
There's a name for girls like her.

500
01:01:59,659 --> 01:02:02,823
All I can say is I'm glad
you didn't behave like that.

501
01:02:43,987 --> 01:02:45,645
I take it you want to try again.

502
01:02:46,932 --> 01:02:49,583
-Yes?
-I was just thinKing.

503
01:02:49,652 --> 01:02:53,198
If there's anything left of that Kill,
and Elsa can get to it...

504
01:02:53,301 --> 01:02:57,458
...and with the fresh scent of lions on it,
she just might get the general idea.

505
01:02:57,750 --> 01:03:00,467
Well, that's good thinKing.
I have a thought.

506
01:03:01,526 --> 01:03:03,730
If we take the kill
to that fellow back there...

507
01:03:03,831 --> 01:03:07,988
...and he thinks she's a good provider,
he might get the general idea, too.

508
01:03:08,568 --> 01:03:11,121
Right. Now it all depends on....

509
01:03:14,904 --> 01:03:17,938
UnfortunateIy,
it turned out to be a large pride...

510
01:03:18,009 --> 01:03:21,621
...who thoroughIy and unhurriedIy
enjoyed their family picnic.

511
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:24,724
It was severaI hours before we got
to the remains of the zebra...

512
01:03:24,826 --> 01:03:28,176
...and take it and Elsa
back to the young bacheIor.

513
01:03:32,251 --> 01:03:34,870
Luckily, he had remained near his tree.

514
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:38,257
But he was most annoyed
by Elsa's ignorance of lion etiquette...

515
01:03:38,333 --> 01:03:41,017
...which calls for the lioness
to bring home the food...

516
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:44,730
...and then sit by until her lord
and master has had his fill.

517
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:48,889
Poor Elsa, of course, didn't know that
and was properly chastised.

518
01:04:27,269 --> 01:04:29,790
That evening,
we suffered all the agony of parents...

519
01:04:29,862 --> 01:04:33,157
...whose teenage daughter
is out on her first date.

520
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:48,707
We returned the next day, only to find Elsa
minus both the young lion and her food.

521
01:05:07,437 --> 01:05:10,121
She was so forlorn
and so happy to see us...

522
01:05:10,189 --> 01:05:13,091
...that I felt guilty about the entire episode.

523
01:05:13,550 --> 01:05:15,460
We took her back to camp.

524
01:05:18,126 --> 01:05:19,981
We resumed basic training.

525
01:05:20,078 --> 01:05:22,282
According to plan,
we'd cut down on her meals...

526
01:05:22,351 --> 01:05:25,963
...hoping that hunger
would encourage her to kill for food.

527
01:06:06,007 --> 01:06:10,677
But to Elsa, stalking other animaIs
was just a game she never took seriousIy.

528
01:06:11,288 --> 01:06:16,274
And she obviousIy enjoyed herself so much
that it was difficult to be angry with her.

529
01:06:17,753 --> 01:06:21,463
George continued to take her out
every day, without resuIt.

530
01:06:22,201 --> 01:06:25,301
Then, one day,
she suddenIy came upon a waethog.

531
01:08:00,203 --> 01:08:02,440
But Elsa's inabiIity to feed herseIf...

532
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:05,191
...meant that George
had to leave the reserve every day...

533
01:08:05,292 --> 01:08:07,812
...and drive a very long distance
to another area...

534
01:08:07,884 --> 01:08:10,568
...where the shooting of game was allowed.

535
01:08:24,976 --> 01:08:27,115
-Tired?
-Yes, I am, a little.

536
01:08:29,328 --> 01:08:30,758
Have a drink.

537
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:32,200
Yes.

538
01:08:44,211 --> 01:08:45,672
As the weeks sped by...

539
01:08:45,779 --> 01:08:48,878
...we continued to leave her overnight
as much as possibIe...

540
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:51,915
...only to find her in the morning
right where we'd left her...

541
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:54,770
...hungry and patheticaIIy happy to see us.

542
01:08:56,341 --> 01:08:58,796
Then, one night just before dawn....

543
01:09:26,074 --> 01:09:30,166
It was Elsa, and it was soon apparent
that she'd had some kind of encounter...

544
01:09:30,267 --> 01:09:34,708
...with other lions, or perhaps a leopard,
and had not come off too well.

545
01:09:48,702 --> 01:09:51,452
Sweetie. George.

546
01:09:53,183 --> 01:09:55,256
I can't think how she managed to find us.

547
01:09:55,551 --> 01:09:58,334
Yes, she does all the wrong things right.

548
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:00,568
Sorry.

549
01:10:10,626 --> 01:10:13,626
After that,
she refused to venture out of camp.

550
01:10:20,259 --> 01:10:21,372
Nice.

551
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:24,483
Yes, it is, isn't it?

552
01:10:27,237 --> 01:10:30,586
-Have you any idea what time it is?
-I left my watch in the tent.

553
01:10:30,662 --> 01:10:34,175
No, I meant the time of year.
We've only two weeks left.

554
01:10:34,662 --> 01:10:36,964
The rains will be on us soon.

555
01:10:37,479 --> 01:10:40,163
Yes, I know. I know.

556
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:42,627
I've been thinking.

557
01:10:42,759 --> 01:10:45,859
We've got to take Elsa out,
and leave her for at least a week...

558
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:48,546
...and we've got to move camp
so that she can't find us.

559
01:10:48,649 --> 01:10:50,438
Make or break, is that it?

560
01:10:50,505 --> 01:10:52,164
Yes, I'm afraid so.

561
01:10:54,346 --> 01:10:55,688
All right.

562
01:10:57,482 --> 01:11:00,418
You've missed out
that pretty bit over there.

563
01:11:01,835 --> 01:11:02,948
Did I?

564
01:11:04,747 --> 01:11:05,828
Yes.

565
01:13:06,657 --> 01:13:10,487
At last, both the week
and the rains came to an end.

566
01:13:52,617 --> 01:13:54,406
Well, let's try this.

567
01:14:27,951 --> 01:14:30,253
All my nightmares had come true.

568
01:14:33,264 --> 01:14:34,672
It won't do.

569
01:14:35,537 --> 01:14:37,904
Look, by now it's obvious
she can't make it.

570
01:14:37,969 --> 01:14:40,337
She can't fend for herself,
mix with her own Kind...

571
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:42,856
...or do anything
a wild lion must do to survive.

572
01:14:42,930 --> 01:14:44,108
We've....

573
01:14:45,426 --> 01:14:47,467
You've done too good a job on her.

574
01:14:47,538 --> 01:14:51,729
We've made her tame, and it's too late
to try to let her go wild now.

575
01:14:51,828 --> 01:14:55,309
All we're doing is making her miserable,
torturing her.

576
01:14:56,436 --> 01:14:58,509
How can you be so cruel?

577
01:14:58,581 --> 01:15:00,523
Do you think I enjoy it?

578
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:04,048
I don't know what goes on
in that head of yours anymore.

579
01:15:04,150 --> 01:15:07,795
You have this fixed idea.
What's wrong with a zoo, anyway?

580
01:15:07,895 --> 01:15:10,099
Nothing, except that she won't be free.

581
01:15:10,167 --> 01:15:12,623
-And is freedom so important?
-Yes.

582
01:15:14,008 --> 01:15:15,088
Yes!

583
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:18,391
She was born free,
and she has the right to live free.

584
01:15:18,584 --> 01:15:21,749
Why don't we live in a nice
comfortable city? Other people do.

585
01:15:21,977 --> 01:15:25,752
But we've chosen to live out here because
it represents freedom. We can breathe.

586
01:15:25,818 --> 01:15:28,633
-Because we're fit for it.
-So could she be! She can.

587
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:31,444
-She'll be safe in the zoo.
-Yes, safe.

588
01:15:31,835 --> 01:15:33,842
And fat and lazy and dull...

589
01:15:33,947 --> 01:15:36,947
...and stupid like some cow
on a milking machine.

590
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:38,424
Joy...

591
01:15:39,516 --> 01:15:41,339
...tell me the truth.

592
01:15:41,853 --> 01:15:43,763
You just don't want to give her up.

593
01:15:43,869 --> 01:15:47,448
What you're hoping is that she can stay
out here wild but not too wild...

594
01:15:47,550 --> 01:15:50,812
...so you can see her every now and then.
That's it, isn't it?

595
01:15:50,910 --> 01:15:54,904
It's not the whole truth,
but I don't deny I'd like it.

596
01:15:55,231 --> 01:15:59,094
It's impossible! It can't happen.

597
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:02,264
Even if she should be able to go wild,
which I doubt...

598
01:16:02,336 --> 01:16:04,725
...that'd be the end.
You'd never see her again.

599
01:16:04,833 --> 01:16:06,327
Then at least she'd be free.

600
01:16:06,433 --> 01:16:08,986
She wouldn't be in a cage
for the rest of her life.

601
01:16:09,346 --> 01:16:11,932
And if she gets herself killed
in the process?

602
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:28,221
I'd never forgive myself, I suppose.

603
01:16:34,117 --> 01:16:37,434
AIthough, at one time,
we were afraid she would die...

604
01:16:37,543 --> 01:16:39,299
...Elsa did recover.

605
01:16:39,559 --> 01:16:42,821
And when she did,
she seemed somehow different.

606
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:47,872
Thanks to John...

607
01:16:47,944 --> 01:16:50,596
...who was wonderfuIIy kind,
despite his reservations...

608
01:16:50,665 --> 01:16:52,640
...we were able to get a time extension...

609
01:16:52,713 --> 01:16:55,430
...as well as permission
to take her to another area...

610
01:16:55,530 --> 01:16:58,148
...only 35 miIes from where she was born...

611
01:16:58,218 --> 01:17:00,902
...and where George
could shoot wild game.

612
01:17:31,184 --> 01:17:34,348
Now, as if she knew
what was required of her...

613
01:17:34,768 --> 01:17:38,282
...she started going out aIone,
sometimes for days at a time...

614
01:17:39,185 --> 01:17:41,390
...only returning when she was hungry.

615
01:17:47,154 --> 01:17:49,838
Then one day,
when we'd followed her into the bush...

616
01:17:49,907 --> 01:17:52,591
...she caught sight of another waethog.

617
01:18:27,738 --> 01:18:30,869
Well, there's no doubt at all
whose kill that is.

618
01:18:31,034 --> 01:18:32,628
Congratulations.

619
01:18:41,212 --> 01:18:45,206
After that, she proved again and again
that she couId feed herseIf...

620
01:18:45,277 --> 01:18:47,928
...and so when she came into season...

621
01:18:48,126 --> 01:18:52,349
...we took her out for what became
her most dangerous and final test.

622
01:21:13,751 --> 01:21:14,962
No, don't.

623
01:22:49,416 --> 01:22:50,758
I'm sorry.

624
01:22:51,272 --> 01:22:53,247
I couldn't stand anymore.

625
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:10,598
It's all right. It's really all right.

626
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:14,504
She's done it. She's crossed the bridge.

627
01:23:15,405 --> 01:23:17,347
She's wild now. And free.

628
01:23:18,317 --> 01:23:21,733
You should be very happy. And proud.

629
01:23:23,406 --> 01:23:24,682
We've....

630
01:23:25,326 --> 01:23:27,814
You've done something
no one else has ever done.

631
01:23:27,919 --> 01:23:30,123
And you should be very proud.

632
01:23:30,511 --> 01:23:31,788
I am...

633
01:23:32,463 --> 01:23:33,991
...of her.

634
01:23:34,928 --> 01:23:37,579
Well, you might at least stop laughing.

635
01:23:48,242 --> 01:23:50,130
-George?
-Yes?

636
01:23:51,283 --> 01:23:53,323
Suppose we never see her again?

637
01:23:53,395 --> 01:23:56,113
We will. We'll come back.

638
01:23:57,364 --> 01:24:00,398
We'll come here
as soon as our leave is over...

639
01:24:00,533 --> 01:24:02,770
...before we do anything else.

640
01:24:03,253 --> 01:24:06,385
And we'll find out how she's been.

641
01:24:07,925 --> 01:24:11,668
Thank you.
Thank you very much for everything.

642
01:24:39,644 --> 01:24:42,743
We did go back.
We had only a week in which to find her.

643
01:24:44,924 --> 01:24:48,405
We camped in the same spot,
and went to look for her every day...

644
01:24:48,477 --> 01:24:50,233
...hoping that we wouId see her...

645
01:24:50,333 --> 01:24:53,367
...and wondering
what she wouId be like if we did.

646
01:24:54,046 --> 01:24:56,567
But we never found any trace of her.

647
01:24:56,927 --> 01:24:59,131
Finally, it was our last day.

648
01:25:12,353 --> 01:25:13,465
Wait.

649
01:25:14,081 --> 01:25:16,024
Let's try just once more.

650
01:26:02,858 --> 01:26:05,608
Nothing. We start back today.

651
01:27:23,064 --> 01:27:26,480
Elsa and her babies
stayed with us all the afternoon...

652
01:27:26,585 --> 01:27:30,447
...and she made it quite clear
that she was happy to be with us again.

653
01:28:02,656 --> 01:28:07,643
I was dying to pick them up and hoId them,
as I had done with Elsa and her sisters.

654
01:28:08,257 --> 01:28:10,144
But I knew that it wouId be wrong.

655
01:28:10,977 --> 01:28:12,603
They were wild...

656
01:28:13,089 --> 01:28:16,439
...and it was better now
that they remained wild.

657
01:28:30,501 --> 01:28:32,224
Her master's voice.

658
01:28:35,717 --> 01:28:37,539
Jump up, Elsa.

659
01:29:31,503 --> 01:29:33,519
We saw her many times again,
born free and living free.

660
01:29:33,519 --> 01:29:35,821
We saw her many times again,
born free and Iiving free.

661
01:29:37,136 --> 01:29:39,755
But to us she was always the same:

662
01:29:40,337 --> 01:29:43,021
Our friend, Elsa.

663
01:29:44,305 --> 01:29:50,870
