00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,749
Ladies and gentlemen,

5
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,261
the second half of our show
will begin in just a couple of minutes.

6
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,921
Please return to your seats.

7
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,183
Hey, Misha.

8
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,021
I didn't think anybody
was actually going to show up.

9
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:39,319
I'm sorry. Do we know each other?

10
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:43,494
Yes, but you don't remember.

11
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,722
I'm Abby Gibbons. Bob's niece.

12
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,797
Right, yeah.

13
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:54,302
You came to visit him
about seven years ago.

14
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,963
Such a cute little girl you were then.

15
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,970
Thanks.

16
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:03,475
Actually it was nine years ago,
and I remember you very well.

17
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,809
You been in Moscow long?

18
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,974
About a year.

19
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,310
Bob never mentioned it.

20
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,980
Yeah, well, that's my secretive uncle.

21
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,826
And the winner is...

22
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,324
creative director Mikhail Galkin.

23
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,898
Still one of the leaders
in the marketing of movies.

24
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:35,340
I've just seen the founder and president
of Best Solution,

25
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:39,278
pioneer of the Russian advertising
industry, Bob Gibbons!

26
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,856
Thank you. What are you doing, Misha?
Come on, get over here.

27
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,692
Bob, what's happened?
Why are you back already?

28
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:03,363
We hit a snag.
You won't be making partner today.

29
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,408
I'm sorry, Mish.

30
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,378
Let's face it, Bob.

31
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,785
For you, this agency is just a cover.

32
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,557
And your people are never going to let me
be a partner in it.

33
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,724
All right, I got it.

34
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,340
So, what are you suggesting here?

35
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,399
Very simple. If I can't be a partner,

36
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,944
then I at least want to be making
the same money off it that you are.

37
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,947
Yeah. Yes.

38
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,857
Where are you? Abby?

39
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,426
Why won't you ever listen to one thing
I ask you to do?

40
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,454
I will call you later.

41
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,634
This goddamn girl's going to be
the death of me.

42
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,602
She won't listen to her parents!

43
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,762
She took a semester off to do
some sort of internship here,

44
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,772
and now she won't leave!

45
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,111
Oh, Christ.

46
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,045
10-fucking-15
and the sun's just starting to set.

47
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:27,487
I will never understand this crazy country.

48
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,792
Oh, one more thing.

49
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,394
I saw how Abby's got her eye on you, so...

50
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:41,630
She's young and... and stupid.

51
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,467
Please.

52
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,310
Stay away from her.

53
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,664
<i>This is Joseph Pascal,</i>

54
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:17,501
<i>the World's leading specialist
on marketing.</i>

55
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,834
Bravo.

56
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,845
Today, the biggest <i>fast</i> food chains
were reeling

57
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,177
<i>from a record decline in profits.</i>

58
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:31,512
<i>Their representatives had assembled
before this guru of marketing</i>

59
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,521
<i>with the hope that he could make a miracle.</i>

60
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,684
I want to talk to you today

61
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,686
about love.

62
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,191
See, I have struggled

63
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,698
to find a way to restore the people's love
of your products,

64
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,898
but it hasn't worked out.

65
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,140
Consumers just no longer wish to buy them.

66
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,803
When it's over, it's over.
They no longer love you.

67
00:08:56,969 --> 00:09:00,280
The era of fast food has passed.

68
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:07,252
But I do have a proposal.

69
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,654
Something which exceeds
the limits of marketing

70
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:13,728
in its traditional form.

71
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:17,561
A plan which will change the world.

72
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:21,899
Together, we will make fat beautiful again.

73
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,667
But first, a question.

74
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,640
How far are you willing to go

75
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,306
to solve your problems?

76
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,642
Whatever it takes.

77
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:36,286
Within the limits of the law, of course.

78
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,581
I'm afraid that's not far enough.

79
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:45,092
Not even nearly far enough,
ladies and gentlemen.

80
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:47,858
<i>The guru's plan was approved.</i>

81
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,192
<i>But due to budget cuts,</i>

82
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,767
<i>it would have to begin
in the third World markets</i>

83
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,269
<i>of Kenya, Brazil and Russia.</i>

84
00:09:55,595 --> 00:10:00,510
So I called because I wanted your advice
on something, Mr. Marketing Award Winner.

85
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,771
But you have to promise
to keep it a secret from Bob.

86
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,881
It's amazing how you Americans
all believe in seat belts.

87
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,722
In America, they advertise
them really well.

88
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,540
Yeah, Misha. Yeah, she's still
screaming like total shit.

89
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:40,144
You're fired. Your company's fired.
Do you hear me?

90
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,685
You're never going to work on another movie
for this studio again.

91
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,419
I'm sorry, I have to go.

92
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:28,591
Let's go.

93
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,709
Check it out.

94
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,871
<i>One of the key instruments
in the Russian part of the plan</i>

95
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:48,075
<i>was an extreme makeover reality TV show.</i>

96
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,810
They're looking for a Russian
production company

97
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,046
to shoot a Russian version of this show.

98
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,719
The corporate sponsor's representative
is in Moscow right now.

99
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:00,227
I want to do the pitch to them myself
and get the contract for Astra,

100
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,060
and then they're gonna make me
an exec producer.

101
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,672
Do you really think this is going to work?

102
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:12,566
Nope.

103
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,909
Misha, what you're doing
had better work.

104
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:19,447
We need 8 out of 10 people tomorrow
in that focus group

105
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:20,743
to want to see this movie.

106
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:24,752
Don't worry, Mr. Johnson,
it'll meet your expectations.

107
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:35,923
So, Misha, where did you learn
that amazingly perfect English of yours?

108
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,090
My father was a British communist.

109
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,998
Immigrated here.

110
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:44,271
And later, he had a falling outwith
communism but they wouldn't let him leave.

111
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:49,545
- That's terrible.
- Yeah.

112
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,939

<i>Coming soon to a theater near you.</i>

114
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,292
Hi, Pavel. Yeah, it's fine.

115
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:16,497
Just add some graphics over the shot that
say, "No one will hear this scream."

116
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,654
WOW!

117
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,501
Sunrise in the middle of the night.

118
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,501
It's so weird.

119
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:56,109
Mish, you know how much I wanted you
to make partner,

120
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:57,838
'cause I love you.

121
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,441
Let's have a drink.

122
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:06,415
So, my very first meal
at The Burger in Moscow.

123
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:12,757
I knew about your guys' custom
for paying for extra ketchup,

124
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,522
so I paid for six packets.

125
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,727
But then, I needed more.

126
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,033
But the cashier says...

127
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:26,869
<i>"Nyet. Nyet"</i>

128
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,538
"You've already had enough."

129
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,880
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

130
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:37,282
Like she fucking decides
that I have had enough.

131
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,984
It's not a real burger, Misha,
if I can't have extra ketchup.

132
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:45,890
It's just a fucking...
it's a fucking facade.

133
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:53,765
This whole country is just like one
Hollywood backlot-fucking-facade.

134
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,234
And it's a really shitty made one at that.

135
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,418
How many of you would buy
a ticket to this movie

136
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,576
based on the advertisement?

137
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,587
That's right!
I told you this movie could work.

138
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,418
- Thanks, brother.
- All right, my friend.

139
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,289
Mish, thanks.

140
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,667
- Bob.
- Yeah?

141
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:33,600
- You forgot your pen.
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

142
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,927
And you still haven't got back to me
about my new deal.

143
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,108
I know. I know.

144
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,484
<i>Misha discovered his talent
for marketing</i>

145
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:54,461
<i>shortly after the fall of the Soviet Union.</i>

<i>Sales doubled.</i>

160
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,695
<i>He had learned the third rule</i>

161
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:05,196
<i>Get paid up front,
because no one believes in marketing.</i>

162
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,530
<i>Enterprising young Misha</i>

163
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,700
<i>abandoned his career
as an unskilled laborer</i>

164
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,707
<i>and opened
his own advertising agency,</i>

165
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,482
<i>Mikhail Galkin Global Marketing,</i>

166
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:24,383
<i>with funds borrowed from an old
family friend, Yuri Nikolaivich.</i>

167
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:35,448
<i>That was the first time Misha
appealed to God for help.</i>

168
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,792
Hi. I'm Bob Gibbons.

169
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,295
<i>Bob agreed to bail Misha out of debt</i>

170
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,797
<i>and to hire him in Bob's
soon-to-be opened</i>

171
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,300
<i>American-Russian
advertising agency.</i>

172
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,460
<i>There was just one catch.</i>

173
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:49,469
Uh, sorry. I...

174
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,069
I don't quite understand this. What-

175
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:55,507
What are you, a SPY?

176
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:59,983
You want me to become a spy, too?
I'm not a spy.

177
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,151
I'm a historian.

178
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,877
Would you do me a favor, please?

179
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,544
Would you just calm down?

180
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,849
Just relax and listen, Misha.

181
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:11,586
Misha?

182
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,326
I'm a real Madison Avenue ad man,

183
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,329
30 years experience, all right?

184
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,166
I do a little work with US A.l.D,

185
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,997
which sometimes works with

186
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,037
other organizations
that shall remain nameless.

187
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:27,837
Listen, you guys are starting up
a democracy over here.

188
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,105
But democracy isn't just about
switching governments,

189
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,180
it's about... it's about business.

190
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:36,410
It's about advertising.
It's about Coke versus Pepsi.

191
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:41,686
Now, we will start

192
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,187
a serious advertising agency,

193
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,260
and we will make a lot of money.

194
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:50,456
The client list is going to be
the new political candidates,

195
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:51,532
the business elite,

196
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,363
movie producers,

197
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,198
and all you have to do...

198
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,240
is keep your eyes and ears
trained on them and report.

199
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,373
Report what?

200
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,537
Whatever you see.
Whatever you hear.

201
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,077
That's it.

202
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,105
- Poor bastard.
- That's my investor.

203
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,136
Yeah.

204
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,269
You're going to be needing
a new investor.

205
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,149
Picture it, Misha.

206
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:42,808
Your new job is just...

207
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:46,752
spreading the principles
of freedom and democracy.

208
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:50,587
<i>And so began Misha's career
as a marketer-spy.</i>

209
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,423
<i>Over the next 15 years,</i>

210
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:57,590
<i>he designed the first Russian campaigns
for a host of Western brands,</i>

211
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:02,262
<i>like the now-famous slogan for The Burger."
"The Taste of Freedom"</i>

212
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:05,704
<i>and he furnished Bob
with reports on his clients.</i>

213
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:08,936
And because of you
and your incredible work...

214
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:13,512
this big beautiful country is now
almost a democracy.

215
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,453
Okay, so look, Abby.

216
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,461
Why aren't you just producing
this reality show yourself?

217
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,296
Why do you think?

218
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,533
'Cause I don't have the money!

219
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,899
How much does it cost?

220
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:42,504
Like $750,000.

221
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,479
What's with your air conditioning
system, anyway?

222
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,086
This is like a brand-new car!

223
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:56,654
What's she doing?

224
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,162
What are you doing?

225
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:11,371
Same as everybody else.
This suit is murder.

226
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,276
You mind looking out the window?

227
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,450
But then that girl will
think I'm staring at her.

228
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:24,720
Doesn't matter, you Russian men
are all supposed to be pigs, anyway.

229
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,456
But the way the Russian women
go around here,

230
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,926
like prima ballerinas
in skin-tight clothing,

231
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:34,898
honest, regular American girl

232
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:38,098
doesn't stand a chance.

233
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,935
There, all done.

234
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,716
What would you say
to doing the show with me?

235
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,587
We are called Extreme Cosmetics.

236
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,585
And this is a real story about a real girl.

237
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,729
Well, she's what you call overweight,

238
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,993
but she's unusually charming.

239
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:14,899
And that's where the miracle happens.

240
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:20,737
This fat cow gets transformed
into a beautiful fawn,

241
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,179
and she becomes a national superstar.

242
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:28,915
And for that,
we need nationwide casting search.

243
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:36,956
I think the real problem isn't the casting,
it's finding the director.

244
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:42,130
Yes, and the best one is Schwartz,
Roman Schwartz.

245
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,793
Astra Productions.

246
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:51,167
So what you're saying is
that Schwartz is your guy?

247
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,510
That's what I'm telling you.

248
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,775
Will you excuse me for a second?

249
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:15,794
Mechislava,
please allow me to introduce

250
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,195
the lead director in our new company,

251
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,564
my friend Roman Schwartz.

252
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,866
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.

253
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,419
Take a look.

254
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,417
Here is the world's first marketing.

255
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,017
What are you talking about?

256
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:48,395
I mean it was Lenin
who invented marketing in 1918.

257
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,065
He found an absolutely unique way

258
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:53,533
to sell people the idea
of Soviet communism.

259
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,729
The factories to the workers,

260
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:56,895
land to the peasants,

261
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:58,370
peace to the soldiers.

262
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,734
He made the product promise one thing:

263
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,505
Happiness.

264
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,844
And that's marketing.

265
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:08,883
Lenin hired just simply the best designers
and copywriters.

266
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,520
Rodchenko...
No, that's not Rodchenko.

267
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,087
But, here, Mayakovsky.

268
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:16,024
The brand's official color: red.

269
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,684
The logo: the five-pointed star.

270
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,796
Once they'd established the super brand,

271
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:23,523
they designed campaigns
for all the product lines to carry.

272
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,634
So, chocolates for Red October,

273
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,532
perfumes, Red Moscow...

274
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,231
And the KGB'?

275
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:38,272
The KGB came later,
like a sort of brand police.

276
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,744
See, it's the dream of every brand

277
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:43,113
to make the competition's products illegal.

278
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:45,221
That's exactly what they did.

279
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:49,219
70 years of total domination of the market.

280
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,791
Tragically, they had really shitty
production, so...

281
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,220
the product failed to
live up to its promise,

282
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:58,630
and consumers fell out of love
with the Soviet Union.

283
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,504
"Dear Mr. Mayakovsky,

284
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:09,236
"It would be our pleasure to invite you
to the United States...

285
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,682
to share with us your fascinating new ideas
about advertising."

286
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:17,587
This is from the president
of General Electric.

287
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,450
A lot of Lenin's guys
lectured for American companies.

288
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:25,019
And, as you can see,
the Americans studied well.

289
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:30,430
This is all very interesting, Misha,

290
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,830
but you still haven't answered
my question.

291
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,632
Why is it you're not married?

292
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,132
I'm not sure we should be doing this.

293
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:18,147
Dating usually just gets
in the way of business, Abby.

294
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,478
These days...

295
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,145
I don't think anything
gets in the way of business.

296
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,158
By the way...

297
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:37,325
there's just one thing I think we should
agree upon from the beginning.

298
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,162
<i>Okay-</i>

299
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:48,702
We're 50/50 partners. Right?

300
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,086
Shut up.

301
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:51,974
- Stop. I should get that.
- Not now.

302
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:10,014
Misha.

303
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,163
Abby!

304
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,105
Get out of the car! Get
out of the car, you...

305
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,766
Get out of that car now!

306
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:32,107
- Don't be scared.
- Out of the car, you fucking coward!

307
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,944
- Just calm down, Bob.
- You want me to calm down?

308
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,780
I am going to calm you
down once and for all!

309
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,114
Abby! Abby!

310
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,517
Hey! Hey!

311
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:43,450
Hey! Abby, get out of the car.

312
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,616
Get out of the car!

313
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,389
It's okay, Abby. It's okay. It's okay.

314
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,292
Okay, okay. He)'-

315
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:56,066
Can we... Can we please just discuss this
like normal people?

316
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:58,363
- You want to discuss it?
- Yeah.

317
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,299
All right, let's discuss it.

318
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:05,880
<i>Misha set out with Abby
to cast the perfect fat girl,</i>

319
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:12,812
<i>having no idea who stood behind
the final decision.</i>

320
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,422
She could be a star.

321
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:17,420
She can be a star!

322
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,021
<i>The show premiered to high ratings,</i>

323
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:59,134
<i>but the night before the operation episode,</i>

324
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,031
<i>the star panicked.</i>

325
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,036
What's she saying?

326
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:15,852
She's saying she doesn't want
to do the surgery.

327
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:24,053
She's scared.
Asking us to let her go.

328
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,723
We have to go to her.

329
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,330
We have to talk to her.

330
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:35,903
No, no, no. It's okay. lt's just nerves.

331
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,563
Nobody needs to tell her anything.

332
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:47,748
- I don't know.
- Abby. Hey, stop it.

333
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,185
Everything's going to be fine.

334
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:02,089
We, like, totally won!
The operation was a success,

335
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,290
and Veronika's sleeping like a baby!

336
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:07,436
There was, like, so much blood
I almost fainted!

337
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,439
You're so full of shit!

338
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:17,777
I know.

339
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,618
Who is this?

340
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:35,387
Misha. Wake up.

341
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:37,464
What? Why are you shaking me?

342
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:38,794
Veronika's asleep.

343
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,296
So let her sleep. I'm also sleeping.

344
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,336
She didn't come out from
under the anesthesia.

345
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:12,499
Have the Veronika crying tape
shown on the evening news.

346
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:56,144
I directed this show like it was a movie,

347
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:02,212
and a real person is lying in a coma.

348
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:05,047
No. No, listen.
That was an accident, okay?

349
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:08,280
What happened to Veronika
is not our responsibility, okay?

350
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:09,550
It is not your fault.

351
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:15,957
Fine.

352
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,228
I'm gonna go see the insurance guys.

353
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:22,729
Hey.

354
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:28,238
Even if you won't have money,
you'll still have me.

355
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:31,812
Look, Abby...

356
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,444
I'm going to see to it
that I have money, too.

357
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:08,844
Mikhail Galkin, one of the producers

358
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:11,509
of the scandalous reality show
Extreme Kosmetics

359
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:13,781
was arrested today on charges of fraud.

360
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:17,282
Galkin's partner,
American citizen Abigail Gibbons,

361
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,450
has also been taken into custody.

362
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,723
Highly placed sources have suggested
that they are being held

363
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:26,334
to quiet public outcry
over Veronika's coma.

364
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:29,131
No, no, no. No, no.
No, no, no.

365
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:33,298
No, let's manufacture
some official medical conclusion

366
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:36,308
that the coma is nobody's fault.

367
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:41,314
Just some unpredictable physical reaction.

368
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:45,477
That's good. I like that. Very good.

369
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,987
No, no. What we want is

370
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:52,151
to make it so that nobody believes
the medical conclusion.

371
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:55,160
But the people still must demand
someone be punished.

372
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,060
I want...

373
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:59,667
some fat, uh...

374
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:03,431
40-something-year-old woman in...

375
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,335
- in Smolensk.
- In Smolensk, saying...

376
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:11,378
"What the hell? So they cut her up
and now it's nobody's fault!"

377
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,733
- Hello?
- Abby!

378
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:16,104
Misha?

379
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,674
I'm at Sheremetevo.

380
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:23,984
I'm going away.

381
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:26,110
Can you hear me?

382
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:29,019
I'm going away forever.

383
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:33,796
It was part of the deal.
Hello? Call Bob.

384
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:37,797
- Call Bob. He'll tell you.
- Abby, I understand everything now!

385
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:39,660
I love you.

386
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:44,101
Abby, I lost you! Abby!

387
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:48,777
I love you.

388
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:51,773
Hello?

389
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,215
Hello?

390
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:14,636
Strange coincidence, wouldn't you say?

391
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:19,473
A simple cosmetic surgery
lands a woman in a coma.

392
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:25,675
The media reacts with a hysteria not seen
since the first man landed on the moon.

393
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:27,825
And you know who it all benefits?

394
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:34,155
You, you fuck!

395
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:37,348
You set this whole thing up
to take Abby away from me

396
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:39,051
and put me under your control again.

397
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,355
Now listen to me, okay?

398
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:48,334
To organize the kind of hysteria that you
are talking about would cost millions.

399
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,733
And to perform that surgery on TV

400
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:54,843
so that your little girl
would fall into a coma

401
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,711
would require some sort
of super-elite killer.

402
00:38:57,868 --> 00:39:00,007
Now, you think, you really think

403
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,412
that I would spend that kind of money...

404
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,287
On you?!

405
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:10,117
I actually thought that perhaps

406
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,887
you came here to thank me.

407
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,558
But no, no, no.

408
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,360
You don't have to thank me
for getting you out of jail.

409
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:23,903
Because if I had any other way
to convince Abby to leave this country

410
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:28,138
your ass would still be in that jail
you son of a bitch!

411
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:31,970
Get out.

412
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,571
Let's have a drink.

413
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,745
Listen, Bob...

414
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,646
There's something I've been wanting
to tell you for a long time now.

415
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:16,483
Why do you think it is that the
very first guy you met in Moscow

416
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:19,628
became the most valuable agent
of your career?

417
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,966
I don't know. Why?

418
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:27,969
Because I was fucking terrified.

419
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:32,263
I'm not a spy, I told you that.
I'm a historian.

420
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:37,512
You, what, thought I...
went around all these years

421
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:39,944
recording my clients
with a hidden spy camera?

422
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,050
You remember my first report?

423
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,280
Yeah.

424
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:48,152
I made it all up for you, Bob.

425
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,982
And you believed me.

426
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,695
You smug, stupid robot.

427
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:59,801
<i>Misha turned his first employer,
the kiosk owner who had fired him,</i>

428
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,335
<i>into</i> a <i>drug-dealing mobster</i>

429
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:03,471
In my mind,

430
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,903
I even imagined my report
like it was the trailer

431
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:10,637
to one of those
Tom Clancy Paramount thrillers.

432
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:15,011
<i>This looks like a normal businessman.</i>

433
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:20,849
<i>But in a place Where
everything is a facade...</i>

434
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,520
<i>to get the truth out,</i>

435
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:28,487
<i>you have to go inside.</i>

436
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,261
Mr. lvanov's Kiosks,

437
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:39,233
<i>coming soon to a nation near you.</i>

438
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:44,173
You told me my reports were just for
analysts to study back in Washington.

439
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,177
But they didn't just study them, did they'?

440
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:53,853
<i>The CIA leaked Misha's information
to The New York</i> Times.

441
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:59,861
<i>Shortly thereafter, a real Russian mobster,

<i>to persuade him that
The New York Times was mistaken.</i>

446
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,412
<i>Misha had discovered
his talent for marketing</i>

447
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:56,575
<i>could not only shape desires

448
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,913
<i>it could do much more.</i>

<i>Marketing could change the World.</i>

450
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,327
You made my life a living hell.

451
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,168
Aw, fuck it.

452
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:58,170
This is RTV News.

453
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:03,080
The Brazilian News Service reports the death
of a 17 year-old model from anorexia.

454
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:07,848
The event was marked by wide-scale protests
in Rio de Janeiro.

455
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,586
Mikhail Galkin?

456
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:38,085
<i>Believing his talent for
marketing was a curse,</i>

457
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:41,189
<i>Misha vowed never to use it again.</i>

458
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:46,688
<i>And since there was nowhere in the city
to go Without advertising,</i>

459
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:51,464
<i>he left, hoping never to return.</i>

460
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:08,207
I congratulate you, ladies and gentlemen.

461
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:11,376
We have completed the first step of this,

462
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:14,113
the most difficult, the most audacious,

463
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:17,725
the absolutely most risky
business strategy in history.

464
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:21,488
We have begun to alter consumers'
concept of beauty

465
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:24,425
in Kenya, Brazil, and Russia.

466
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:29,329
I guarantee, in five years,
nobody will recognize these countries.

467
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:34,767
We begin with the third world,
and then we'll transform the rest.

468
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:38,437
Picture a world where only
fat women will be popular.

469
00:45:38,602 --> 00:45:42,744
Fat will become the new fabulous.

470
00:46:58,382 --> 00:46:59,486
Misha!

471
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:03,096
Misha!

472
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,435
Misha!

473
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:28,514
So you're a shepherd now?

474
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:36,195
I was totally convinced I'd find you
with, like, a wife and five kids.

475
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,425
I don't have anybody.

476
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:34,088
What are you doing here?

477
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,085
Sleeping-

478
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:43,428
I mean, what the hell are you doing here?

479
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,099
What, you think you're a Buddhist?

480
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:55,772
You're no Buddhist.

481
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:00,948
I know you.

482
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,715
You were so strong.

483
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:10,949
I was always so amazed
by how strong you were.

484
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,958
I'm sorry, Abby, but I'm not going back.

485
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,303
I can't.

486
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:27,909
You wanted everything!

487
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,139
And now what do you want?

488
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:33,838
Your uncle once told me I was a bad man.

489
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:37,884
- You know, he was right.
- Misha.

490
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:42,490
The world will be a better place, Abby,
with me staying out here.

491
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:13,614
<i>That night the same force
that had marked Misha as a child</i>

492
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,855
<i>sent him a message in a dream.</i>

493
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:29,535
<i>He dreamed, while shepherding his cows
he grew very tired and fell asleep.</i>

494
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:38,206
<i>In the dream Within the dream,
he saw nothing.</i>

495
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,541
<i>He only heard a voice.</i>

496
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:44,208
<i>A voice that told him
there was something he must do.</i>

497
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:48,550
<i>It described it to him clearly
and in perfect detail.</i>

498
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:52,250
<i>After that, he Woke up.</i>

499
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:59,059
Upon awakening, he remembered
ah' that had been <i>told</i> to him

500
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:05,399
<i>as if each and every Word
had been inscribed in his head.</i>

501
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:08,941
<i>And he was sure that, if he did
What the dream told him to do,</i>

502
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:13,740
<i>he would understand
the meaning behind everything.</i>

503
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:33,687
<i>Give me love triple triple,
give me happiness double double</i>

504
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:37,757
<i>'Cause I be a big hero
and I stay big for the beat</i>

505
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:41,054
<i>Look at this city,
and look at this party</i>

506
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:43,094
<i>Big, your time has come</i>

507
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:45,028
<i>Big people, be yourself</i>

508
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,189
<i>Let's go</i>

509
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,267
<i>If you get more fat,
I would like it like that</i>

510
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:49,902
<i>Fat, fat</i>

511
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:51,936
<i>If you get more fat
I would like it like that</i>

512
00:58:52,095 --> 00:58:53,540
<i>Fat, fat</i>

513
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:55,733
<i>If you get more fat,
I would like it like that</i>

514
00:58:55,899 --> 00:58:57,537
<i>Fat, fat</i>

515
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,646
<i>If you get more fat,
I would like it like that</i>

516
00:58:59,802 --> 00:59:01,645
<i>Fat, fat, fat</i>

517
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:32,410
Misha!

518
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,617
What's wrong?

519
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,779
Quiet. Don't move.

520
00:59:42,946 --> 00:59:43,947
<i>Okay.</i>

521
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:52,658
What are you doing?

522
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,430
Misha!

523
00:59:59,329 --> 01:00:00,364
Huh?

524
01:00:00,863 --> 01:00:02,171
Oh, uh, nothing.

525
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:05,438
Nothing. Everything's fine.
Fine. Fine.

526
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:10,512
Thank God. You were passed out
for, like, forever.

527
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:18,723
Is this Moscow?

528
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:21,795
Yeah, this is Moscow.

529
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:26,066
I'm sorry, I couldn't just leave you there.

530
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,799
I don't know how to tell you this
without completely shocking you.

531
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:34,972
Hi, baby.

532
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,168
This is your son.

533
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:41,638
Robert.

534
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:50,556
Robert...

535
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:53,250
This is your father.

536
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:56,158
Mommy, I don't think that's Daddy.

537
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:02,534
And he was a really nice guy.

538
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:05,430
And he proposed.

539
01:01:06,596 --> 01:01:08,337
And Robert really liked him.

540
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:11,569
And I just kept thinking about you.

541
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:17,010
That time when we were together
was the best time of my life.

542
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,552
I was so in love with you.

543
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:24,523
I just had to try and find you...

544
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:32,060
and see if what was between us
was still in the past.

545
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:42,603
I'm scared.

546
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:56,217
So you're not mad at me for kidnapping you?

547
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:58,654
Of course not.

548
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,562
I just want to look at you.

549
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:11,899
What's wrong?

550
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:23,240
It was a mistake.
We never should have done it.

551
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:24,612
No, it wasn't.

552
01:02:26,843 --> 01:02:29,790
Please, you're the one who looks at me
like you hate me.

553
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,422
You don't believe that.

554
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:39,264
That's right. You saw creatures!

555
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:41,766
God, you're such a sick freak!

556
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:45,701
Abby, I really do see creatures on you!

557
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:47,938
Fuck you, Misha.

558
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:14,962
I'm sorry.

559
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:23,307
I am really sorry.

560
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:30,978
It was just a hallucination.
We'll get you better.

561
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:41,256
<i>Misha discovered that What the voice

I don't know when we'll be back.
It all depends, you know.

566
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:59,878
Just remember to water my plants.
That's it, yeah.

567
01:04:00,036 --> 01:04:02,016
Sorry. Excuse me. Do you...

568
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:05,050
Do you have $7 'I, -"2 million'?

569
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:06,687
Hold on one second.

570
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:10,680
Bob left it to me in his will.

571
01:04:12,548 --> 01:04:14,721
So now you've got money and me.

572
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:16,963
Happy?

573
01:04:18,387 --> 01:04:19,525
Yeah...

574
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:24,202
<i>He read that it cleanses you

577
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:51,889
- You promised.
- Robbie, I didn't promise you anything, okay?

578
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:53,965
<i>Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!</i>

579
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:56,897
No. I don't like this attitude.

580
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:03,404
Mommy, I want it! I want it!
You promised.

581
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:06,273
- Don't you think that's a little bit fattening?
- Huh!

582
01:05:06,435 --> 01:05:07,846
Robert.

583
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:11,745
Why does he have to say
stupid stuff like that?

584
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:13,649
What do you say to your father?

585
01:05:14,844 --> 01:05:15,754
You say you're sorry.

586
01:05:16,312 --> 01:05:17,916
Sorry.

587
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:19,649
<i>Okay.</i>

588

Mommy, Mommy, please
can I have some? Huh, Mommy?

589
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:29,995
I want it. I want it.
Please, Mommy, come on!

590
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:34,267
All right.

591
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,546
- Weirdo.
- Hey.

592
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:20,813
Hey, remember what I said about
crossing the streets?

593
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:22,482
You remember?

594
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:26,051
No more burger if you don't remember.

597
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:00,551
Oh, it's okay, I was...

598
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:03,394
My head was just spinning for a second.

599
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,863
Come on, let's go.

600
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:17,071
So finally we get to look
like a regular family.

601
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:20,539
Of course. We are a family.

602
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:06,820
"And so Ramek defeated Gaunt Worm
and freed the good princess."

"And they bestowed upon him
the name Ramek...

conqueror of beasts."

605
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:24,210
Read it again, Daddy. Please?

606
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:34,383
Be back in a hour with the tickets.

607
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:40,560
Bye-bye, Daddy. Don't eat my hamburger.

608
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:42,417
Come on, baby.

609
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:04,076
Okay, Misha. What the fuck?

610
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:08,371
Listen, Abby, I have tried to pretend
that everything is okay,

611
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:11,211
but, Abby, everything is not okay.

612
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:14,411
- Yeah, I can see that.
- All right. I see them.

613
01:10:14,577 --> 01:10:19,048
And I know I'm really seeing them.
It's brands, Abby. They're alive!

614
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:22,219
I see how it works! Don't...

615
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:24,421
Please don't look at me like that.
I am not crazy.

616
01:10:24,587 --> 01:10:26,066
Misha.

617
01:10:26,455 --> 01:10:28,775
And I know who's responsible
for what happened to Veronika.

618
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:32,465
I know who put her into a coma!
I know who destroyed our lives!

619
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:33,732
Who?

620
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:35,102
Fast food!

621
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:38,073
The fast food corporations
are responsible for all of it!

622
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:40,305
Loan-
I can prove it to you.

623
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:45,283
It was a conspiracy,
a disgusting, cynical conspiracy.

624
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:49,082
All the noise surrounding
what happened to Veronika

625
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:52,624
was manufactured
to alter people's image of beauty.

626
01:10:53,616 --> 01:10:55,254
To make fat cool.
Cool to be fat.

627
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:57,863
Cool to eat more hamburgers.
I mean, look what they've done to people.

628
01:10:58,020 --> 01:10:59,341
Look what they've done to Robert!

629
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:02,327
What have they done to Robert?

630
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:07,106
What have they done to him?

631
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:15,278
Okay. OkaY-<i>...</i>

632
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:19,282
Here.

633
01:11:20,976 --> 01:11:24,048
They feed off our desires, okay?

634
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:26,286
You begin to want something,

635
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:30,794
and this... this big weird creature
growing out of you starts getting bigger.

636
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,363
Okay? They make you have desires

637
01:11:33,522 --> 01:11:36,298
that aren't the kind
that can be completely fulfilled.

638
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:37,994
They've gotten totally out of control!

639
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:40,531
It's not as if we can have
that many desires anyway

640
01:11:40,696 --> 01:11:41,970
to have them wasted on these...

641
01:11:43,499 --> 01:11:44,807
things!

642
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:48,808
What's gotten out of control?
Fast food's gotten out of control?

643
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:50,644
No, what's fast food got to do with it?

644
01:11:51,407 --> 01:11:54,820
I mean, yes, yes, fast food is...

645
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:57,389
It's all the brands. It's the whole system.

646
01:11:57,546 --> 01:12:02,188
It's an occupation.
A subtle, unnoticeable occupation,

647
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:06,163
and everyone is just running around happy!
Ever}, /one's smiling!

648
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:08,663
That's because everybody wants to be happy.

649
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:16,268
A castrated lamb is happy, too, Abby.

650
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:17,909
Great.

651
01:12:18,067 --> 01:12:20,069
Because it doesn't know what it lost.

652
01:12:21,603 --> 01:12:25,176
I mean, we don't even know that desires
can be different anymore.

653
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:29,756
We have been trained to love shit,
want shit, and shit shit.

654
01:12:30,212 --> 01:12:32,123
Trained? Trained by whom?

655
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:33,259
Lenin!

656
01:12:34,049 --> 01:12:38,794
Marketing was invented by Lenin!
Don't you remember any of this?

657
01:12:39,288 --> 01:12:42,735
And now, it's the foundation
of the world economy.

658
01:12:42,891 --> 01:12:46,429
The great global brand revolution has won.

659
01:12:46,595 --> 01:12:51,544
We are all still living in the world
Lenin created.

660
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:57,578
It used to be the brands were formed
from peoples' desires.

661
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:04,881
Now it's the people that are being formed
according to the desires of the brands.

662
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:09,222
Fine.

663
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:12,554
<i>Okay</i>

664
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:16,229
What are you going to do about it?

665
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:24,469
I don't... I don't know.

666
01:13:26,268 --> 01:13:27,906
I don't know what I'm going to do.

667
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:29,845
Hey...

668
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:34,478
I know what you need to
do about all of this.

669
01:13:35,944 --> 01:13:37,855
You need to go see a doctor.

670
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:42,321
This strange and deadly new disease
continues to grip Russia.

671
01:13:42,484 --> 01:13:43,963
10 more fatalities today,

672
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:47,430
and medical authorities
are no closer to determining its source.

673
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:49,125
What's causing the outbreak?

674
01:13:49,291 --> 01:13:52,431
Well, we at the World Medical Association
are continuing...

675
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:53,937
Pull over please, Abby.

676
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:57,373
To caution everyone that while the virus
is deadly in 40%...

677
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:04,617
The disease cannot be classified
as epidemic.

678
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:30,808
Misha?

679
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:32,468
Hey.

680
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:36,146
Why don't you let me help you?

681
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:40,078
Let me help you.

682
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:46,755
Abby. Abby, I didn't mean to...

683
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:56,068
Abby!

684
01:14:56,825 --> 01:14:58,031
Wait!

685
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:20,516
Guys?

686
01:15:28,457 --> 01:15:29,527
Robert?

687
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:35,941
Abby?

688
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:41,537
Misha...

689
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:46,045
<i>All of this is too hard and unhealthy
for Robert and me.</i>

690
01:15:46,975 --> 01:15:48,921
<i>I'm sorry, but we can'? be together</i>

691
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:51,554
<i>We're going on vacation alone.</i>

692
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:55,058
Please leave the apartment
before our return.

693
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:15,609
The violence has gone too...

694
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:19,613
16 medical authorities
signed the letter to the President.

695
01:16:19,775 --> 01:16:23,587
The letter labels the outbreak
of the new disease a pandemic

696
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:25,782
far more dangerous than bird flu.

697
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:41,871
of the late 20th century and the
early 21 st, had clear sources.

698
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:45,944
When HIV-AIDS appeared,
people quickly learned what to do

699
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:50,140
and what not to do to avoid
contracting the deadly virus.

700
01:16:50,305 --> 01:16:53,616
The origin of the new disease
is still unknown,

701
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:56,449
and, to date, there is no effective cure

702
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:57,682
on the horizon.

703
01:16:57,846 --> 01:17:01,123
Robert Black, I-(LN News, reporting.

704
01:17:45,727 --> 01:17:49,675
Distinguished leaders of restaurant chain
Dim Song,

705
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:54,671
it is my great pleasure to introduce you

706
01:17:54,836 --> 01:18:00,377
to a true legend in the world of marketing,
Mikhail Galkin.

707
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:03,213
So, gentlemen...

708
01:18:03,912 --> 01:18:08,383
you wish to introduce a chain of vegetarian
restaurants into the Russian market.

709
01:18:09,184 --> 01:18:11,630
I've analyzed the results
of the focus group,

710
01:18:11,787 --> 01:18:15,200
and, frankly, I must say
you have a problem.

711
01:18:15,891 --> 01:18:18,462
Russians just don't like your product.

712
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:22,899
Marketing in its traditional form
is simply powerless here.

713
01:18:27,436 --> 01:18:31,043
Thank you for your very
interesting opinion, Mr. Galkin.

714
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:33,778
I do, however, have a proposal.

715
01:18:34,209 --> 01:18:38,419
Something which exceeds the limits
of marketing in its traditional form.

716
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:41,994
But first, let me ask you a question.

717
01:18:43,785 --> 01:18:47,062
How far are you willing to go
to solve your problem?

718
01:18:47,222 --> 01:18:49,224
We are ready for anything.

719
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:51,837
Anything within the law, of course.

720
01:18:52,961 --> 01:18:55,464
I'm afraid that's not going to be
far enough, gentlemen.

721
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:18,493
We are ready to go far enough.

722
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:21,093
Fine.

723
01:19:21,923 --> 01:19:25,370
Then I would like you
to mass-produce and market

724
01:19:26,161 --> 01:19:29,108
a little apparatus for testing beef.

725
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:33,610
A beef tester, for short.

726
01:19:34,469 --> 01:19:37,609
- What?
- A beef tester.

727
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:38,940
What?

728
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:36,002
Yeah, it's good.
Just add some graphics that say,

729
01:20:36,164 --> 01:20:39,168
"Test your beef or taste your death."

730
01:20:43,872 --> 01:20:45,044
Right, guys!

731
01:20:45,273 --> 01:20:48,015
Despite the beef tester campaign's
insinuation,

732
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:50,178
only 12 percent of Russians polled

733
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:53,189
believe there is a link between
mad cow disease

734
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:57,296
and the deadly new virus that has
to date claimed over 500 lives.

735
01:20:58,186 --> 01:21:01,224
In response, the Russian minister
of food and agriculture

736
01:21:01,389 --> 01:21:05,462
consumed a hamburger live on TV today
during a press conference

737
01:21:05,627 --> 01:21:09,302
in which he announced
a nationwide ban on the campaign.

738
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:13,642
As a result, restaurant chain Dim Song

739
01:21:13,802 --> 01:21:16,646
has recorded
record losses for last quarter.

740
01:21:18,373 --> 01:21:20,546
You tell Mr. Min Tao

741
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:24,119
banning the beef tester campaign
was part of the plan.

742
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:29,295
You tell him that now is the time to open
and advertise his restaurants.

743
01:21:29,451 --> 01:21:31,761
A lot of restaurants.

744
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:37,162
And tell him that I would suggest not
limiting his campaign to Russia alone.

745
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:39,565
What?

746
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:48,745
Following the government's ban

747
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:51,077
on the advertising
campaign for beef testers

748
01:21:51,239 --> 01:21:52,843
and the sudden, unexplained death

749
01:21:53,008 --> 01:21:55,921
of the Russian minister
of food and agriculture,

750
01:21:56,077 --> 01:21:57,988
consumers are now completely convinced

751
01:21:58,146 --> 01:22:00,285
that beef is deadly dangerous.

752
01:22:10,358 --> 01:22:12,634
Meanwhile, over the last three days,

753
01:22:12,794 --> 01:22:16,298
32 vegetarian restaurants
opened in Moscow alone

754
01:22:16,464 --> 01:22:19,968
where one can eat without having
to test every slice of beef.

755
01:22:20,135 --> 01:22:23,776
Whether this nevi/found love
of all things vegetable will stick,

756
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:26,112
only time can tell.

757
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:33,123
From the streets of Moscow, Russia, this
is Diana Kruger, Business Channel News.

758
01:24:35,804 --> 01:24:38,910
Abby, it's me.
Everything's changed now.

759
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:41,581
Sorry I was sick, but now I'm okay.

760
01:24:42,277 --> 01:24:44,188
I know it sounded crazy
when I told you

761
01:24:44,345 --> 01:24:46,791
that fast food was to blame
for everything,

762
01:24:46,948 --> 01:24:49,087
but look, if in a week,

763
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:52,322
or if in two weeks
The Burger goes bankrupt,

764
01:24:52,587 --> 01:24:55,261
then I'm not crazy
and you'll answer my call.

765
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:09,806
Ladies and gentlemen,
I understand your despair.

766
01:25:09,971 --> 01:25:11,143
Believe me, I do.

767
01:25:11,306 --> 01:25:16,551
But, unfortunately, I have practically
nothing to cheer you up with.

768
01:25:17,011 --> 01:25:19,457
But, perhaps...

769
01:25:20,448 --> 01:25:23,327
Oh. Looks like a storm is coming.

770
01:25:26,688 --> 01:25:28,964
Wait, what were you gonna say?

771
01:25:29,724 --> 01:25:32,227
I don't want to get your hopes too high...

772
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:42,471
We're joined today in the studio
by economic analyst Mark Short.

773
01:25:42,837 --> 01:25:44,373
Now, I want to ask you the same thing

774
01:25:44,539 --> 01:25:47,145
that must be on the minds
of many of our viewers out there.

775
01:25:47,308 --> 01:25:49,481
Fine, people have stopped eating beef
for the moment,

776
01:25:49,644 --> 01:25:53,490
but why is that having such a big effect
on these massive fast food corporations?

777
01:25:53,648 --> 01:25:57,152
What, you're telling me
they don't have billions saved up?

778
01:25:58,153 --> 01:25:59,496
Well, that's exactly right.

779
01:25:59,888 --> 01:26:02,334
You have to understand
that their hard costs alone

780
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:05,266
for a week of operation
are in the hundreds of millions.

781
01:26:05,827 --> 01:26:08,671
Mommy, are hamburgers bad
in America, too?

782
01:26:09,264 --> 01:26:12,905
Come on. Come on, Abby, pick it up.

783
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:17,241
Come on, pick up the phone.

784
01:26:21,676 --> 01:26:24,680
Abby, pick up the phone.

785
01:26:24,846 --> 01:26:29,522
It's very unlikely consumers will return
to beef any time in the near future.

786
01:26:30,518 --> 01:26:33,362
I love you. Pick up the phone.

787
01:26:34,622 --> 01:26:38,365
demanded a government bailout.
Do you think that's likely to happen?

788
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:42,372
There's really no chance
of a government bailout.

789
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:45,477
Well, do you think
the fast food industry can survive?

790
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:48,374
That depends on what kind of food
they choose to serve.

791
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:50,208
You've reached Abby and Robert.

792
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:53,447
Leave us a message
and we'll call you right back.

793
01:26:57,779 --> 01:27:01,056
When the threat came only from the
Russian market, they could withstand it,

794
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:03,287
but now that the beef scare
has gone global,

795
01:27:03,451 --> 01:27:05,294
the end comes for them rather quickly.

796
01:27:05,486 --> 01:27:07,898
Well, I never thought I would live
to see the day.

797
01:27:53,768 --> 01:27:58,774
- ...has joined the conference.
- ...CEO has joined the conference.

798
01:27:59,774 --> 01:28:04,780
- The president of BFO has joined the conference.
- The leader has joined the conference.

799
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:10,524
Ladies and gentlemen...

800
01:28:11,519 --> 01:28:15,490
The Burger is dead.

801
01:28:18,293 --> 01:28:22,537
The growth of brands has spiraled
out of control.

802
01:28:23,698 --> 01:28:27,510
Never before in history has it been
this difficult to record growth,

803
01:28:27,669 --> 01:28:31,879
because there simply is not enough room
in the minds of consumers

804
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:35,146
to hold new desires for new products.

805
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:41,859
What happened in the case of fast food has
fundamentally altered the market forever.

806
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:46,731
A crippling anxiety has seized consumers.

807
01:28:47,922 --> 01:28:50,664
They're terrified the
products can hurt them.

808
01:28:52,327 --> 01:28:57,072
A unique opportunity now stands before you.

809
01:28:58,499 --> 01:29:03,005
The time has come to clear a free space
in the minds of consumers

810
01:29:04,005 --> 01:29:06,007
where your products can live on.

811
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:11,756
Today, in order to get consumers
to continue to desire computers

812
01:29:11,913 --> 01:29:16,191
you have to first make them
lose interest in cell phones.

813
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:21,698
What you need is to convince them
that the competition's brands

814
01:29:21,856 --> 01:29:23,858
are deadly dangerous.

815
01:29:25,526 --> 01:29:27,403
Destroy the market for cell phones...

816
01:29:28,262 --> 01:29:30,242
and eradicate the competition.

817
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:35,542
For your brands to grow,
they need to learn how to attack.

818
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:40,615
And I know how to teach
your brands to attack.

819
01:29:55,723 --> 01:29:59,500
<i>12 months after the re/ease
of Misha's rumor campaign,</i>

820
01:29:59,660 --> 01:30:04,109
<i>every remaining corporation in the World
was using his new technology.</i>

821
01:30:04,265 --> 01:30:07,178
<i>And so</i> began a <i>total brand war</i>

822
01:30:07,335 --> 01:30:09,178
<i>Everyone for himself.</i>

823
01:32:50,298 --> 01:32:51,436
Well, Jon...

824
01:32:53,334 --> 01:32:55,405
Thank you so much for taking us
to the concert.

825
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:56,776
We had such a lovely time.

826
01:32:58,239 --> 01:33:01,015
- My pleasure.
- Right, Robert?

827
01:33:05,179 --> 01:33:09,423
The popular outcry against advertising
continues to be felt across the globe.

828
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:11,996
To be an advertiser today
has become more dangerous

829
01:33:12,153 --> 01:33:15,100
than to admit being a homosexual
in the 1950s.

830
01:33:15,256 --> 01:33:18,032
Nowhere has this been harder felt
than in Moscow, Russia.

831
01:33:18,759 --> 01:33:21,501
- The Duma recently voted down legislation...
- Look, it's Daddy.

832
01:33:21,662 --> 01:33:23,972
Proposing a universal
ban on all advertising.

833
01:33:24,131 --> 01:33:27,340
As last week's bombing of Red Square
by extremists demonstrates,

834
01:33:27,501 --> 01:33:29,777
many in the public strongly disagree
with this decision.

835
01:33:29,937 --> 01:33:32,281
And here is one of the leaders
of Russian advertising,

836
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:34,784
Mikhail Galkin. Mikhail?

837
01:33:35,476 --> 01:33:37,649
Mikhail? One question please?

838
01:33:38,779 --> 01:33:40,452
The final word on whether
the Russian government

839
01:33:40,615 --> 01:33:42,959
will ban advertising
is in the hands of the President.

840
01:33:43,117 --> 01:33:44,562
What's he going to do?

841
01:33:46,887 --> 01:33:48,958
I'm sure the President
will make the right decision.

842
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:07,517
You've reached Abby and Robert
in Moscow.

843
01:34:07,675 --> 01:34:09,677
Please leave us a message
after the tone.

844
01:34:10,645 --> 01:34:11,680
Hi, Abby.

845
01:34:14,081 --> 01:34:15,424
I'm calling to say goodbye.

846
01:34:17,652 --> 01:34:19,325
I've tried everything.

847
01:34:21,722 --> 01:34:25,101
I even met with the President,
but he wouldn't listen.

848
01:34:28,763 --> 01:34:30,333
You've been right all along.

849
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:34,169
What I really needed to
do was see a doctor.

850
01:34:37,638 --> 01:34:39,879
20 years ago, I wanted to get rich,

851
01:34:41,375 --> 01:34:44,379
and that ended with the death
of an innocent man.

852
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:49,957
10 years ago, I wanted to get really rich,

853
01:34:50,851 --> 01:34:53,855
and that ended with Veronika in a coma.

854
01:34:55,956 --> 01:34:58,960
Now I decided to make the world
a better place,

855
01:35:00,695 --> 01:35:03,972
and instead I just made things worse.

856
01:35:08,736 --> 01:35:12,047
Why was I so sure the government
would ban advertising?

857
01:35:12,206 --> 01:35:15,210
They will never ban advertising.

858
01:35:19,313 --> 01:35:20,951
I must have been obsessed.

859
01:35:23,718 --> 01:35:26,756
And now it's like
I've come to my senses and...

860
01:35:29,423 --> 01:35:30,265
and there's bl...

861
01:35:32,226 --> 01:35:33,830
blood everywhere...

862
01:35:35,996 --> 01:35:38,237
and it's all my fault, my...

863
01:35:41,736 --> 01:35:43,579
my insanity.

864
01:35:50,411 --> 01:35:51,754
I wish...

865
01:35:56,016 --> 01:35:56,960
I wish...

866
01:35:59,820 --> 01:36:01,322
Oh, fuck it.

867
01:36:18,272 --> 01:36:19,615
What's going on?

868
01:36:20,941 --> 01:36:22,614
I'm calling you.

869
01:36:26,614 --> 01:36:28,059
<i>Okay</i>

870
01:36:56,510 --> 01:36:57,488
Abby, come on!

871
01:37:12,827 --> 01:37:14,204
Go! Get inside!

872
01:40:02,162 --> 01:40:03,869
Yeah!

873
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:09,107
You are on, young man!

874
01:41:37,257 --> 01:41:39,601
<i>And a new era began.</i>

874
01:41:40,305 --> 01:41:46,334
