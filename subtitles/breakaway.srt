00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:35,556
The ice hockey game
between Toronto Maple Leads...

3
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:39,120
...and Detroit Red Beats has
been quite interesting so far.

4
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,461
Overtime has been given to them.

5
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:44,196
In this final round, both
the teams have made two goals.

6
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,362
What is this?

7
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,838
The centre of Leads
Rajveer Singh has got the puck.

8
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:50,201
And he is at the breakaway.

9
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,573
He has crossed the red line.

10
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:54,374
There is nobody
between him and the goalie.

11
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:14,661
Rajveer Singh
hoodwinked the goalie...

12
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:16,759
...and moved him from his position.

13
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:18,269
And goal.

14
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:19,430
What a goal!

15
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:23,704
Rajveer Singh has done a miracle.

16
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:26,643
He won the game like a dream.

17
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:30,114
The crowd is dancing
with delight on the victory.

18
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:52,529
Mother. Mother.

19
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:53,697
Take this.

20
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,146
Do not fear.

21
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,819
Rajveer.

22
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,125
Rajveer.

23
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,196
Dad.

24
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:23,696
Today...

25
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,296
Today, I am dead.

26
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,766
Dad, what are you doing here?

27
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:31,275
Working. And you?

28
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,140
You are sleeping.

29
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,470
Have you laid eggs here
that you sleep here every day?

30
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,243
I just took a short nap.

31
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,409
Son, remember.

32
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:41,252
You can get either success or rest.

33
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:45,623
If your uncle sees you sleeping,
he will fire you.

34
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:49,393
Useless fellow, all
this can be yours.

35
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:52,927
Just once show your
uncle you are capable.

36
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,501
I don't think I will
lose this job, dad.

37
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:58,729
Why do you feel like so?

38
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,272
Which idiot will do this job?

39
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,301
Rajveer, what do you see here?

40
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,303
Trucks.

41
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,347
Be a bit farsighted.

42
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:13,709
Yes, dad. I should
say I see my future.

43
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:17,347
Mr. Darvesh and Mr. Rajveer Singh,
please come to the office.

44
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:20,559
Come and answer your uncle.

45
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:22,326
Why do you worry so much, dad?

46
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:23,521
I can't save you every time.

47
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,190
Uncle Sammy is very cool.
Yes. Uncle Sammy.

48
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,764
You will tell him you
were sleeping in the truck.

49
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:31,395
You are ashamed. Fine?

50
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:32,563
Fine.

51
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,942
Uncle Sammy.
Rajveer.

52
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,308
Come in.

53
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,513
Brother, hello.
Hello.

54
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:46,242
Uncle, aunt, sorry. I...

55
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,846
There is good news. Reena is
getting married next month.

56
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:53,690
Sonu, herfiancé, has
agreed to come to Tornado.

57
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:55,589
It's God's grace.

58
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,691
Congratulations.
He is a gem.

59
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,425
You will be pleased to meet him.

60
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:01,594
He is a talented boy.

61
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,795
He is an expert in stock exchange.

62
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,633
You are next, Rajveer.

63
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,667
My niece in
Jalandhar is perfect for him.

64
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,600
Check her out on facebook.

65
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,406
Stop your marriage bureau.

66
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,945
We will conduct
Rajveer's marriage...

67
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:16,641
...when he will do the entire shift...

68
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,581
...without sleeping in the truck.

69
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,280
Am I right?

70
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,253
He dreams of fair
damsels sleeping in the truck.

71
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,414
Once again congratulations.

72
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,354
Congratulations.
Thank you, brother.

73
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,624
Raj. Raj.

74
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,329
Raj, pass it.

75
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,594
Raj, nobody is here. Pass it.

76
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,333
Raj, here.

77
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:42,840
Raj, I told you to pass it here.

78
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:47,004
You gave a good pass.

79
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,479
You want a pass or goal?

80
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:49,640
Zero, you fool.

81
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:52,446
Raj, henceforth we will
consider you equal to two players.

82
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,610
There is another option.

83
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,381
Put your stick in
your mouth and play.

84
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:56,547
This is not possible.
Why?

85
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:59,386
His tongue is very smooth.
Smootherthan his hands.

86
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,687
Do pass it to us at times.
I see.

87
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,523
Hero.
Look. Look. Look.

88
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,296
Who are they?

89
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,325
Leave. Yourtime is up.

90
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,866
We still have10 minutes.

91
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,329
They are Hammerheads.

92
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:10,494
Hammer my foot.

93
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,504
They are barging in. It's our ice.

94
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:13,698
Hammer...

95
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:15,098
Watch it.

96
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,510
What's your problem?

97
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:20,807
I don't have any problem.

98
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,110
I am just waiting for you
jokers to leave the ice.

99
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:24,816
Smarty, don't lock horns.

100
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:28,685
Leave before I lock horns.
Lock horns.

101
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:31,889
Yourfather locked horns by
bringing you into this world.

102
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,955
So?
- Push. "Fool."

103
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:37,924
Yes. What?

104
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:39,123
Listen.
Yes.

105
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:40,932
Ensure that your player
doesn't commit a murder...

106
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,058
...and soil my ice.

107
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,432
Look, I don't want to lock horns.

108
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:44,828
I just want to score goals.

109
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,605
Two for Raj. And
zero forthe foreigner.

110
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,340
Good shot.

111
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,113
Come on. Lock horns.

112
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:57,976
Leave.
Stop. Leave.

113
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,143
Raj. Come on. It's over.

114
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,555
Have you gone crazy?

115
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,023
We have come here to
practice ice hockey...

116
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,423
...and not judo or karate.
Fools.

117
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,154
Coach.
Yes.

118
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:10,453
Shall I try?

119
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,896
I have good players. You
go and play with marbles.

120
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:16,059
Coach, the kid should get a chance.

121
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:18,501
Yes, coach. Let's see
how much guts he has.

122
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:19,868
Come on.
Fine.

123
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:22,671
Raj. Come on, Raj.

124
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:24,772
Come on, Raj. Well done. Well done.

125
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:26,476
Pass.
Come on.

126
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,838
Pass it here. Hey.

127
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:33,544
There you go.

128
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:36,579
Raj, you are playing well.

129
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:39,984
Here. Here.

130
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:42,960
Dan, I have been waiting for
you forthe past half an hour.

131
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,394
Do you want to come with me or not?

132
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,625
Yes. I want to come. I was
watching this Indian player play.

133
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:47,791
He is not bad.

134
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,463
Lick the glass.

135
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:52,468
Hey.
He is not that good too.

136
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:55,773
Hey. Hey.

137
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,070
Come on. Come on. Come on.

138
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,202
Good. Good.

139
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:02,203
Yes. Come on, Raj. Yes!

140
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:03,640
Yes

141
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:04,876
Goal!
- Yes!

142
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:06,510
Come on.

143
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,952
Did you see? I told you. He
is not less than them. - Yes.

144
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:10,819
Yes.
Okay. Enough, kiddo.

145
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,023
Everybody, come. Come on.
This was Enough forthe kiddo.

146
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:17,854
Coach.

147
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,420
Done? That's it.

148
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:20,891
Yes. Over.

149
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,533
I was the best player.

150
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,465
I will send you the
ticket of ourfinal match.

151
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,201
Don't mind. You are
not worthy of this team.

152
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:32,938
Good practice, guys.

153
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,815
Indians don't have any
value in the rink, Raj.

154
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,717
Forget it. It's their loss.

155
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,451
See you.
See you.

156
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,219
Shameless.

157
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,259
But you were playing quite well.
So you were watching.

158
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:53,790
Nonsense.

159
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,130
You are calling hockey nonsense.
Not me. Right?

160
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,168
This is human rights' case.

161
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,162
They were slandering you openly.

162
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,900
Now, I am used to it.

163
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,539
There are rules in Canadian chart...

164
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,237
...of human rights
against such behavior.

165
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,771
What happened? Why are you laughing?

166
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:12,542
I swear. You look prettier
when you are fuming with rage.

167
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,577
Are you a lawyer?

168
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:16,713
Almost. I am studying law.

169
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,824
Fine. If you everwant
to save this poor man...

170
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:20,984
...you will find me here.

171
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,785
Getting beaten.

172
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:24,621
Who are you?

173
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,661
My brother. The great Dan Winters.
You must have heard about him.

174
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,064
In some season he had played...

175
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,261
...for Red Wings for a few days.

176
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:31,595
Yes. Four matches.

177
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,502
I think you play well.
Thanks.

178
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,165
When you are not kissing the glass.

179
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,538
You shouldn't have let
them take advantage of you.

180
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:39,235
Did you hear, lawyer?

181
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,745
Next time save me.

182
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,272
Good. But I don't think
you can afford my fees.

183
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,109
No discount for
friends and relatives?

184
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:47,777
And you are?

185
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:48,979
Your new friend.

186
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:50,585
Rajveer.

187
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:55,625
You have started
helping strangers, Melissa.

188
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:58,129
No. - Since when did
you become my father?

189
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:00,697
Since the time you
started helping strangers.

190
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,064
Concentrate on your studies.
Thanks forthe advice.

191
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,702
Let's settle one thing.

192
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,598
I am just a tenant in your house.

193
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:08,037
And you are my hassled brother.

194
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:10,835
Fine.

195
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,605
But curb your social service.

196
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,229
Who died? And where is the body?

197
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:41,431
Gurveer.

198
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:43,498
Why did you leave
from work so early?

199
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:44,869
We had our hockey practice.

200
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,172
I had told you.

201
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,410
Mother, today it was great fun.

202
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,749
Today, I played with Hammerheads.

203
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:55,448
It's a champion team.

204
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:57,686
They have been winning the Hyundai
cup forfour consecutive years.

205
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:58,985
They took you in theirteam?

206
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:02,251
No. They didn't.

207
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,590
They didn't take you in theirteam.
But...

208
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:06,492
I was thinking of retiring
and settling down in Miami.

209
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,225
It was an equal competition, dad.

210
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:10,427
Competition?

211
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:13,500
Lavleen, will you ask your son?

212
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,764
Where did the word 'work'
disappearfrom his dictionary?

213
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,001
Son, he means to say...
Tell him.

214
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:21,508
Had I played cricket,
he would have...

215
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,808
...danced with delight at each shot.

216
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,975
Look, he thinks you...
India is the king of cricket.

217
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:26,616
Crores of people watch cricket.

218
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,314
Ask him. Does anyone in
India even know about ice hockey?

219
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:31,447
Look, son. Hockey...
Ask him.

220
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,355
In Canada which
channel shows cricket?

221
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:34,893
Ask...
My neck is tired.

222
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,690
Shall we eat?
Yes.

223
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,392
I don't know where my
son has disappeared.

224
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,438
I don't know him.

225
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:51,610
He cut his hair. He
dozes off at work.

226
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:54,646
Mother, tell
fatherto talk lovingly.

227
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,507
Otherwise he will spend his old
age in an old age home... - Raj.

228
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:02,713
Eight dollars.

229
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,691
When I came to this city,
I had only eight dollars.

230
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,350
I provided education to my brother.

231
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:10,418
He converted eight
dollars into eight billion.

232
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,788
I didn't ask anything
from him. Besides a job.

233
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:19,266
And if my son is capable,
he will run his business.

234
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:21,033
I don't think that
day will ever arrive.

235
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:23,741
I am there. I am a good son too.

236
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,036
Shut up.

237
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:31,338
If you think you will play
ice hockey, you are mistaken.

238
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:32,675
Don't worry, dad.

239
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:35,852
As a hockey star's father,
you can retire early.

240
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,822
Then you can rest on a beach and
see bikini... - Stop your nonsense.

241
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:40,416
Enough.

242
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,585
Henceforth you will
concentrate on yourwork.

243
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:46,597
And in yourfree time you
will do service in Gurdwara.

244
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,462
Henceforth, no hockey. Got it?

245
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:51,635
Henceforth, no hockey.
You never saw me playing.

246
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,001
I don't even want to see.

247
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,747
Can I eat his 'Ras Malai' (Sweets)?

248
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:05,910
Keep quiet and eat yourfood.

249
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,087
Are you fine, brother?
Yes.

250
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,794
Dad says all that
because he loves me more.

251
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,024
I am kidding. You are his brave son.

252
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:24,399
You do so much drama.
What are you doing? Leave.

253
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,903
"I am your good son."
Leave, brother.

254
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:27,630
Don't do that.

255
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,136
Fatso. - Don't do it again.

256
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,374
Son, please finish your dinner.

257
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,772
I have lost my appetite, mother.

258
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,340
Son, try to understand yourfather.

259
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:39,816
I admit he is a bit stubborn.

260
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,487
When you cut your hair,
he kept quiet.

261
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,581
When you left university, he
arranged for a job for you...

262
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,989
...at your uncle Sammy's place.

263
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:49,118
You also have some duty,
don't you, son?

264
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,056
Please eat.

265
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:55,994
My darling son.

266
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,708
Come on. Come on.

267
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,078
Pass it here.

268
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:16,713
Pass it here.

269
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:17,881
Come on.

270
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,385
What are you doing?

271
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,118
Take this.

272
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,660
Goal. Yeah!

273
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,194
Ourteam?
Yes.

274
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,165
'Kabbadi' (lndian game).

275
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:37,631
'Kabbadi'. 'Kabbadi'. 'Kabbadi'.
Shut up.

276
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,940
'Kabbadi'. 'Kabbadi'. 'Kabbadi'.
We can win the Hyundai cup.

277
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,536
What are you saying?

278
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,876
Have you gone crazy?
Okay. Okay. Tip-cat.

279
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,608
You are watching too
many cartoon films.

280
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:49,984
Raj, we play hockey like kids.
That too very badly.

281
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,883
Rubbish.
Yes. Have confidence, friends.

282
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:53,515
We will give
Hammerheads a tough time.

283
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:54,650
What do you say?
Fine. Listen.

284
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,558
They are smarter,
speedier, and beefierthan us.

285
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,459
Yes.
Fair-skinned. Have you seen it?

286
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:02,056
Hi, guys.
Hi, Reena. - Hi.

287
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:05,198
Do you know me? - Bye.

288
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:07,667
Bye.
Reena is So pretty.

289
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,900
She is my cousin.

290
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:11,841
Whenever I see her on news,
I wish I was her microphone.

291
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,902
Hindi. Hindi. She has got engaged.
So?

292
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,571
No problem.
And she is not yourtype.

293
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,147
What's my type?
Flirty type.

294
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,108
Hey.
He got angry.

295
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:20,617
Rajveer, we are leaving.

296
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,578
Everything fine? Take this.
You fool.

297
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,125
Get ready.
Later.

298
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:39,264
"This is my world, beloved."

299
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:40,896
"This is my world."

300
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:43,407
"This is my world, beloved."

301
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,306
"Move, move now."

302
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:47,538
"We will not be touched."

303
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,706
"Got the game on stuck."

304
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,942
"We cannot be seen."

305
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:53,617
Have faith.
I Have faith.

306
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,844
I have full faith
that we will be mocked.

307
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:00,850
What are all of you doing here?

308
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:03,925
Practicing for Hyundai cup.
Practicing for defeat?

309
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:05,821
What do you think? We are losers?

310
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:06,990
What do you think?

311
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:08,597
I am the coach of this team.

312
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:15,804
Wow! You will surely
become the coach of the year.

313
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,400
So what should we do?

314
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:19,335
What do you mean by we?

315
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:23,709
If you know what to do to be
the coach of the year. Teach me.

316
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,409
Guys.

317
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:28,378
Everybody come here.

318
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:29,879
Come here.

319
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:34,486
You farted again.

320
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,652
How's it going?

321
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:37,661
Fine. Perfectly fine.

322
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,827
Your name?
Singh. Deva Singh.

323
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,826
Yours?
Inderjit Singh.

324
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,236
Yours?
Jassi Singh.

325
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:48,762
You are also a Singh?

326
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,372
Right. Rajveer.

327
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:51,735
All of us are Singhs.

328
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:54,303
So many brothers?

329
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,678
Brothers from different mothers.

330
00:16:58,884 --> 00:16:59,976
Okay.

331
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:02,980
Singhs.

332
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,790
You have only two options.

333
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,889
Enterthe ice, have fun and lose.

334
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,259
Or be strong, break some
bones and give yourself a chance.

335
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,658
There are two types of hockey.

336
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:15,296
Hockey that you play on the street.

337
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:16,659
And real hockey.

338
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:17,861
Watched by entire Canada.

339
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:21,297
The ice on which it's played,
it's softerthan Rajveer's cheeks.

340
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,276
I don't know whether all
of you can play or not.

341
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,675
But I know how to find out.

342
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:32,381
Isn't he the ice cleaner?

343
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:33,743
Seems to be him.

344
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,354
"Move, move now."

345
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:37,582
"We will not be touched."

346
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,089
"Got the game on stuck."

347
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:41,383
"We cannot be seen."

348
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,619
"Unstoppable force is
the Indian dream team."

349
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:45,663
"You know who we are."

350
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:46,993
"We are the Indian royalty."

351
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,294
"We run the world."

352
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,460
"This is my world, beloved."

353
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:51,833
"This is my world."

354
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,568
"This is my world, beloved."

355
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,437
"This is my world."

356
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,403
"This is my world, beloved."

357
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,809
"This is my world."

358
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:03,607
"This is my world, beloved."

359
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:04,944
"This is my world."

360
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,347
Sonu, this is our Speedy Singh.

361
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:11,648
It's nice, sweetie.

362
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:15,017
Shall we leave? I have just landed.
Let me rest for a while.

363
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:18,323
Darling, my entire
family is waiting for you.

364
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:19,489
They are not going anywhere.

365
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:21,722
We are Indians. We can
be late. Don't worry.

366
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,495
One moment. It's from
the TV station. Hello.

367
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:25,595
'Desi Tadka'.

368
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:29,505
I have told you so many
times I won't do a cookery show.

369
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:33,534
"Your beloved's truck is
flying through GT Road."

370
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,376
Son, since you are going
to be my company's driver...

371
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,678
...let me tell you
what you have to do.

372
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,943
Atruck is delicate like a woman.

373
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:44,682
You should treat her
lovingly and politely. - Okay.

374
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:48,419
Keep her happy. There shouldn't
be a shortage of adornment.

375
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:51,555
But always drive safely.

376
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,998
You mean, seatbelt, right?

377
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:57,831
Right, uncle. Okay. Give it a name.

378
00:18:58,437 --> 00:18:59,529
Melissa.

379
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,539
Melissa.
- It's a nice name.

380
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,834
No. It should be a Punjabi name.

381
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,844
Okay. How about Malinder?

382
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:09,840
It's good.

383
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,676
Hello, Malinder.

384
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,011
Come on.

385
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:19,691
You fool. Is this
how you handle a woman?

386
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,892
Now, I know why you
don't have a girlfriend.

387
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:26,857
Step on the accelerator.

388
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,457
Alright.
- That's it. It has started.

389
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,596
Last time my stomach rumbled...

390
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,797
...so badly that my eardrum exploded.

391
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:35,863
Brake. Brake.
Where is the brake, uncle?

392
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,698
Reena. Reena.
You are forcing me.

393
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:38,765
Start the car.
Hold on, Sonu.

394
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:39,936
Start the car.

395
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:42,673
I said I am coming.

396
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,749
I will try to come
as soon as possible.

397
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:50,647
What is this, Sonu?

398
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:53,190
You are so petrified
of meeting my dad.

399
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,026
Don't worry. He will like you.

400
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:58,521
Hello.

401
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:00,791
Did you poke my niece on facebook?

402
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,591
If you poke her, she will like it.

403
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,903
I will do it today.
Look. I Have her photo.

404
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,062
Yes.

405
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:08,837
Ms. Punjab. Third runner-up.

406
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,838
What is this, aunt? Only third?

407
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,570
She would have won
if the other girls...

408
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:14,009
...had not slept with the judges.

409
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,444
Why should I keep quiet?
I heard it.

410
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,038
I will tell everybody in school.
Son, no.

411
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,583
She is cute.
Everybody, please pay attention.

412
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,152
He is my Sonu.

413
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,889
Hello. - He is my elder
brother Darvesh Singh.

414
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,221
My sister-in-law Lavleen.
Hello.

415
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:29,783
Hello.
And theirtwo lovely sons.

416
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:30,919
Gurveer and Rajveer Singh.

417
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,255
How are you?

418
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:35,733
You are so strong. Do
you lift trucks? - Good.

419
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:36,893
You will defeat Khali.

420
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,197
Naughty kid.

421
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,396
Rajveer.

422
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,330
Reena has told me a lot about you.

423
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,306
This is what you call her,
don't you? You call her Reena.

424
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,740
And I call her Sonu's sweetie.

425
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:46,705
You drive truck so well.

426
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,439
I don't know how we survived today.

427
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:50,409
Next time I will try my best.

428
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:51,774
Good.

429
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,216
It's good that you left
college forfamily business.

430
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,984
History is the witness that
undergrads have always succeeded.

431
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,857
Sonu, look. Yourwould-be wife.

432
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,924
Wow! - Amazing!

433
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,854
It's looking good on you.

434
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,861
I had ordered it
especially from France. - France.

435
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,664
By sending a Punjabi team for
the famous Hyundai Tournament...

436
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:14,638
...Tornado's Indian community has
created a place forthemselves...

437
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:15,934
...in Canada's national game.

438
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,272
This is Reena Singh from S.I.N.

439
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:19,833
Wow! You look so beautiful.
- Amazing!

440
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:21,837
Rajveer, you are also playing,
aren't you?

441
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,640
Rajveer has decided
to give up hockey.

442
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:27,815
Now, he has to concentrate
on other important things.

443
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:29,786
For instance, learning
his uncle's business.

444
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,616
Right, Rajveer? - Yes, dad.

445
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,515
Wow! Nice plan, uncle.

446
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,349
You are perfect forthis.

447
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:36,989
"Move, move now."

448
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:38,321
"We will not be touched."

449
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,921
"Got the game on stuck."

450
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:42,290
"We cannot be seen."

451
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,528
"Unstoppable force is
the Indian dream team."

452
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,230
"You know who we are."

453
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,897
Throw it out. "We are
the Indian royalty."

454
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,031
"We run the world."

455
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:51,035
"This is my world, beloved."

456
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:52,903
"This is my world."

457
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,037
"This is my world."

458
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,508
Come on. Have a meal and come here.
Excuse me.

459
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:02,310
Excuse me.
The doctor has come.

460
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:03,513
I have taken training in first aid.

461
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:04,885
Maybe he has hurt his head.

462
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:07,652
You look like Katrina Kaif.
What problem do you have?

463
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:09,353
I hit him softly.
Okay.

464
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:10,520
Don't worry.

465
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:13,928
Lie down. You will be fine.

466
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,357
Breathe.

467
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,300
Breathe deeply.

468
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,565
"Come to me."

469
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:20,969
"Come to me."

470
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:23,403
"Come to me."

471
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:24,908
"Come to me."

472
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:26,670
"Come to me."

473
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:28,506
"Come to me."

474
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,504
"Come to me."

475
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,449
"Come to me."

476
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:34,511
"Come to me."

477
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:37,020
"Dance and show me, beloved."

478
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,420
"Come to me."

479
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,890
"Move yourwaist."

480
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:42,085
"Come to me."

481
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:44,761
"Come, let us both dance."

482
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,956
"Come to me."

483
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:47,723
"Come to me."

484
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,590
"Dance merrily."

485
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:53,035
"You are teasing me tonight."

486
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:56,097
"I want the dance floor by my side."

487
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:57,399
"My side."

488
00:22:57,476 --> 00:23:00,604
"I feel like seeing
you day and night."

489
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:04,370
"Dance with me."

490
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:07,418
"I also love you."

491
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:11,311
"Don't you know that my
heart belongs to you?"

492
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,818
"Come to me."

493
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:15,325
"Dance and show me, beloved."

494
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,656
"Come to me."

495
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,390
"Move yourwaist."

496
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:20,692
"Come to me."

497
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:22,961
"Come, let us both dance."

498
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:24,399
"Come to me."

499
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,029
"Come to me."

500
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:28,335
"Come to me."

501
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:30,066
"Come to me."

502
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,035
"Come to me."

503
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,509
You will enjoy it. Trust me.

504
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:34,670
Take this.

505
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,839
Move, you fool.
What happened?

506
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:39,640
I am not interested in kissing you.
Come on.

507
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:42,845
Get up.

508
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,047
Get up. I was giving
you fake CPR. That's it.

509
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:45,521
Get him out of the ice.

510
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:47,356
Where did Taj Mahal go?

511
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:48,854
The music stopped?

512
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:50,553
What?
- What's happening?

513
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:53,154
You slipped here and
fell into Bollywood.

514
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:54,624
Beloved.

515
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:56,464
I love you.

516
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:59,433
I think you have got
a major concussion.

517
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:02,973
Sorry. I spoke rubbish outside.

518
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,771
You were embarrassing
yourself and not me.

519
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:08,145
How do you feel now?

520
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:09,839
Tell me.

521
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,412
Will you come on a date with me?

522
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:14,682
I don't date hockey players.

523
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:17,119
You are lucky. I am
a truck drivertoo.

524
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:18,884
But I don't date them as well.

525
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,390
I will leave both
these things for you.

526
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,484
Especially those
who leave theirwork.

527
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:28,932
I think locker room
is only for players.

528
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,433
I am waiting for you in the car.

529
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:31,833
How are you now, Raj...

530
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,398
Rajvinder.

531
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:36,100
Raj is enough.

532
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,505
What is your sister's problem?

533
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:41,876
You think I am your spy?

534
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,807
What have you
thought about coaching?

535
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:49,046
Ten turbaned men.
All ten are Singhs.

536
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,644
I can't pronounce
theirfirst names properly.

537
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:52,053
They can't skate properly.

538
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:53,181
Leave alone play.

539
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:56,093
What can be worse than this?

540
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:58,888
It will be a miracle if we
play the first round well.

541
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:03,859
What?

542
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:06,031
You said we.

543
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:13,042
If it's in your destiny,
what can a person do?

544
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:35,989
Why are you following me?

545
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:37,360
What do you mean?

546
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:39,494
Why are you in my
favorite restaurant?

547
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:41,336
Don't act smart.

548
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:43,601
My friend praises this place a lot.

549
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:45,575
I have never eaten Indian food.

550
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:47,407
I thought I should try it.

551
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,270
How is your head?

552
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:51,406
You seemed unstable at the rink.

553
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,011
I am sitting in front of you.
I am perfectly alright.

554
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,512
Rajveer.

555
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,049
How are you, son?

556
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:01,553
Is everything fine at home?

557
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:03,861
Yes, Mr. Patel. Everything is fine.

558
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:05,791
Meet Melissa.
Hi.

559
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,430
First date?
Yes. - No.

560
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,500
I will consider it a yes.

561
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,629
Okay. Did I hear it right that
you are practicing hockey nowadays?

562
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:15,673
You are in that team about which...

563
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,503
...your sisterwas talking on TV?

564
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:22,302
No. No. - Yes. You are.
You are the captain.

565
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:23,944
Think whether you
are the captain or not.

566
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:25,346
If you are, I will
waive today's bill.

567
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:27,644
Waive today's bill?

568
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,910
Yes. I am the captain.
You heard it right.

569
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:31,319
What will you have, captain?

570
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,914
If you permit, shall
I place the order?

571
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:37,294
Okay. Let's begin
with 'Chicken Tikka'.

572
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,523
Good choice.
- 'Tandoori Jinga' (Fish). - Okay.

573
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,293
And mixed fritters.
Okay.

574
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:43,061
Cottage cheese vegetable. Curry.

575
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:44,461
And chicken 'Biryani'
(Flavored rice) too.

576
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:47,004
God bless you. - Afew flatbreads,
garlic and butter.

577
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:50,502
And rice.

578
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:52,600
And curd salad to keep her calm.

579
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,105
Anything for you?

580
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:56,439
No.

581
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:57,874
This will be enough.

582
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,041
Are you ordering
forthe entire team?

583
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,914
I am afraid it will be less.

584
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,116
Okay. Why were you not
telling him you are in the team?

585
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,093
My father doesn't like this game.

586
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:10,419
Why?

587
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:14,328
Have you noticed that
I look different from...

588
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:15,457
...the otherteam members?

589
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:18,900
Yes. They wear a turban. And
you don't. What's the big deal?

590
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:22,901
It's a big deal for a
boy born in a Sikh family.

591
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:27,073
When a Sikh boy cuts his hair...

592
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,613
I used to get angry
when people would see...

593
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:31,615
...not me but what was on my head.

594
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,114
I was 12 years old when a few boys...

595
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:38,845
...were playing hockey in my lane.

596
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,858
They allowed me to play on the
condition that I am the goalie.

597
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:44,687
I started playing.

598
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:46,355
After some time the game was about...

599
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:47,898
...who drops the turban from my head.

600
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:54,565
I broke my nose.

601
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:56,106
Both my eyes turned black.

602
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:59,409
That's why you cut your hair?

603
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:00,938
You may say so.

604
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:05,774
What is this?

605
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,410
I have made this forthe captain.
It's special.

606
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:12,185
Wow! My mouth is watering.

607
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,456
You also have it.
You begin.

608
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,926
Okay. Fine.

609
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:20,859
No.

610
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:27,029
What happened?

611
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:28,936
I am dead. It's so spicy.
Are you fine? What happened?

612
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:31,737
Drink water. Mr. Patel. Mr. Patel.

613
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:35,771
Peppermint.

614
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:38,809
Is that so?

615
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:42,046
After burning my mouth you
are trying to entice me.

616
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,452
I am not flirting with you.

617
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:46,718
Are you fine?

618
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:49,089
Because you can file a
human rights case on Patel.

619
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:53,691
Thanks for giving me a
taste of Indian food.

620
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,701
Okay. Will Chinese
be okay next time?

621
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,498
Goodnight.

622
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,206
Somebody give me a massage.

623
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:10,937
My legs are broken.
- All of you don't have energy.

624
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,684
Chess players are more energetic.

625
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,117
Friends, he is kidding.

626
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:17,552
Because you don't have to
move in a chess tournament.

627
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:18,714
Am I right?

628
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,119
All of you insult me there.

629
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:23,683
Henceforth we will stay
on the ice for longer.

630
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,229
I want more
commitment from all of you.

631
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,756
Coach, we want a nice uniform.

632
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:30,466
Right?
Yes. True.

633
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:32,901
It feels as if a team
of beggars is playing.

634
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:34,063
Right?
Yes.

635
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:37,666
I like it. Look, red color.
Its designer.

636
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:39,573
All of you are right.

637
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:41,202
We look like beggars.

638
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,940
If somebody has money and
pity for us hapless people...

639
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:47,246
This is the time.

640
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:58,120
What do you say? Is
Speedy Singhs okay?

641
00:29:58,596 --> 00:29:59,961
It's great.

642
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:03,493
What do you think?

643
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:06,059
Should I invest money in
this Punjabi hockey team?

644
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:09,669
We will have to see Mr. Singh's ROI.

645
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:13,437
Return on investment.

646
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:17,976
Look, we can't take a major decision
without a business proposal.

647
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:19,141
So...

648
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:20,509
You are intelligent.

649
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:22,278
Thank you.

650
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:27,113
Uncle, what profit in
supporting your community?

651
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:30,751
Deva's team's name
will be Speedy Singhs.

652
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,395
It's great, isn't it?
Speedy Singhs.

653
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,757
It's a good name.

654
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:40,435
Fine. Let's have a
fundraising party.

655
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:43,303
I will invest the remaining money.

656
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,212
Deva came imploring for his team.

657
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:57,015
I understood it will be really
beneficial to invest money in...

658
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:59,249
...lndian community's ice hockey.

659
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:01,224
Hello. Hello.
I told him.

660
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:04,125
Let's invest in a
profitable venture.

661
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,355
See this.

662
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,228
Today, it's so lively because of me.

663
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:09,527
Please. Please. Enjoy yourself.

664
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:11,634
He has come to ask for more money.

665
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,603
Eat something.

666
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:16,139
He spoke nonsense.
You must be hungry.

667
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,198
Look, we don't get along well.

668
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:20,244
But soon we will be family.

669
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,575
When Reena marries you.

670
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:23,705
What do you mean?

671
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:26,508
She is crazy. I don't
know what she sees in you.

672
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:28,277
Right. Good one.

673
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:32,116
If that is the case, we
will behave like nephews.

674
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,625
Just bear in mind that I am
your boss's would-be son-in-law.

675
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:37,587
What do you mean?

676
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:39,630
You will have to work
under your brother-in-law.

677
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:41,622
Punjabi boy crazy for hockey.

678
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,493
Good luck, bro.

679
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:46,161
Well said.

680
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:48,064
Be real.

681
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:51,402
Coach Winters.

682
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:54,175
I have met you before, haven't I?
Hi.

683
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,405
It is betterthat you
concentrate on your game.

684
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,277
Drunkard, be careful.
Don't fall down.

685
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:59,475
Reena, your mother is sloshed.
Take care of her.

686
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,677
Why has everybody come here?
Mom.

687
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,118
Uncle Sammy.

688
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:04,552
How are you?

689
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:05,782
He is...

690
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:07,282
Inderjit.
Inderjit.

691
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:09,523
How are you?
- It's fun.

692
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,687
Uncle Sammy, he is
our coach Dan Winters.

693
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:13,288
How are you?

694
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:16,299
Pleased to meet you.
She is my sister Melissa.

695
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:17,459
Good to see you.

696
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:19,730
Mr. Singh is the owner
of Speedy Singh transport.

697
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:21,465
As well as the
sponsor of this event.

698
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:23,331
His lovely wife.

699
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:25,171
Hi.
Hello.

700
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:28,168
His beautiful daughter Reena.

701
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:29,804
Hi. How are you?
Fine.

702
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:32,407
I think my face is up.

703
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:36,483
By the way, pleased to
meet you, Mr. Winters.

704
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:37,646
I am fortunate.

705
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:39,883
Your support is very
important for ourteam.

706
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:42,623
And your nephew is
ourteam's best player.

707
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,587
Rajveer.

708
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,656
He is also in the team?

709
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:48,790
Yes.
No. No.

710
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:50,427
He is not in the team.

711
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:53,302
He is not in the playing team.

712
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:56,363
He is like a supporterforthe team.

713
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:58,671
He is the team's supporter.
That is what he meant.

714
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:00,301
He doesn't even know how to play.

715
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:02,771
Don't worry. By the way,
I am the goal keeper.

716
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:05,611
I have heard you have written
my name on all your equipments.

717
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:07,615
So you know?
Yes.

718
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:08,811
I see. Yes.

719
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:24,560
Son.

720
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:26,529
Yes, mother.

721
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:28,636
I know what you are thinking.

722
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:30,674
Is that so?
Yes.

723
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:34,309
I just want to say
that we are proud of you.

724
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:37,246
I always knew you are
not like yourfriends.

725
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,613
They are wasting their
lives for a stupid game.

726
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,810
I told you, Lavleen.

727
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:43,877
Someday he will
realize his responsibilities.

728
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:47,189
Papa, listen.
I am proud of you.

729
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:48,820
Monica.

730
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:49,951
One moment, son.

731
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:52,692
Let me enjoy the dance.

732
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:10,573
Melissa.

733
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:12,977
Do I know you?

734
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:14,712
Shall we have a dance?

735
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:17,818
You will get to know me too.

736
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:19,687
I am a very bad dancer.

737
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:22,884
Come. I will teach you.

738
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:30,456
You will raise a lot of funds.

739
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:31,627
You are happy, aren't you?

740
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:33,363
It will be good help forthe team.

741
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:34,798
Yes. That's true.

742
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:37,606
When are you meeting me again?

743
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,971
Why? You can't see
me clearly this time?

744
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:43,211
I mean, just the two of us.

745
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:45,982
We are not alone here.

746
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,513
That is yourfamily?

747
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:52,616
Yes.

748
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:54,418
How do you know?

749
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:59,987
Because they are the
only people staring at me.

750
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:04,301
Did you see my eyes? - That's
how I know they are yourfamily.

751
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:12,773
How does he know that foreigner?

752
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,571
Foreigner? - The same
foreignerwith whom he was dancing...

753
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:17,477
...as if he is
dancing in his marriage.

754
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:18,879
That foreigner.

755
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,212
Do you know?

756
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:23,181
He is punishing me because I
didn't let him play ice hockey.

757
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:25,349
It means, if he can't
play foreigners' game...

758
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:26,549
...he will get a foreigner girl.

759
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,387
They were not doing anything wrong.

760
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,949
They were only dancing.

761
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:32,719
We also danced only once.
We had two kids.

762
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:33,923
Not just that.

763
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,967
Patel told me he had come to his
restaurant with a foreigner girl.

764
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:38,566
She ate like a pig.

765
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,497
You are talking nonsense.

766
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:42,471
Yes. When he will marry
that foreignerwitch...

767
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,667
...you will know what is nonsense.

768
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,910
Stupid tie.

769
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,340
I hate ties.

770
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:52,773
What else do I hate?

771
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:56,946
Apple pie. What is it called?
Peanut butter.

772
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,548
Untie it.

773
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:04,421
Come on, boys.

774
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,362
How did they come here?

775
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:12,595
It's our practice time.

776
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:15,905
Maybe I did double booking.

777
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:17,974
Coach, you did that deliberately.

778
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:19,634
Sooner or later, you have
to play with Hammerheads.

779
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,768
Why not today?

780
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,437
Let's see how good you are.

781
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:23,946
Don't you trust my capability?

782
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,381
If you have so much confidence,
go and prove yourself.

783
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:28,042
Go.

784
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,479
Fine. Today, we will see them.

785
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:38,256
Terminator.

786
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:39,757
Have some pity on us.

787
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,429
Fine, scoundrel.

788
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:45,761
Take this.

789
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:55,069
You...

790
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:10,991
Go, kiddo. Go and drink milk.

791
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:12,854
Take this.

792
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:14,559
Deva. Deva, get up.

793
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:16,628
Deva, are you fine? Come on. Get up.

794
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:18,427
Deva. Deva.

795
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:20,970
Rogue.
Enough fortoday.

796
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:23,501
It was nice to play with you.

797
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:24,666
Bring him here.

798
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:26,509
Are you fine?
Yes. I am Fine.

799
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:30,108
Deva, sorry. You got hurt.

800
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:31,645
If you had not got hurt,
they would have been...

801
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:32,842
...still hammering us.

802
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:34,744
I don't know why they are jealous.

803
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:37,083
Fine. We were overconfident.

804
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,549
Okay. Me.

805
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:44,426
Our plight will be bad.
We need help.

806
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:46,486
We need practice.
One moment, friends.

807
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:48,525
I will tell you what the problem is.

808
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:52,359
We need some strong boys.

809
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:56,906
Oh, my God.

810
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:58,373
This is 'Kabaddi'.

811
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,909
India's great sport.

812
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:04,939
This looks like sumo and wrestling.

813
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:07,477
Actually, it's very simple.

814
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:08,950
But difficult to explain.

815
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:11,119
We are not here forthat.

816
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:15,457
Nikku Singh.

817
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:17,388
We would play hockey
when we were kids.

818
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:21,762
He is very beefy.

819
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:24,931
That's what we need.

820
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:49,718
Uncle.

821
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:50,920
Yes, Sonu.

822
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:53,657
Sir said to take your
approval forthe road schedule.

823
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:57,726
It will be good to send
Rajveer on his first trip.

824
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:00,836
Good. I will do my best.

825
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:02,031
Thank you.
No problem.

826
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:22,018
Hi, papa. Sorry. I am late.

827
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:24,323
You fool. At times come on time.

828
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:25,555
Take this.

829
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:27,358
Our hero has come.

830
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:29,490
Liked it at the Gurdwara?

831
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:31,932
Good. Very good.

832
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,031
The food's aroma is great.

833
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:37,438
Thank you.
Mother, teach Reena cooking.

834
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:39,772
It will be good if she
learns it before marriage.

835
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:41,902
I am noticing everything, Sonu.

836
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:43,844
You never leave a
chance to taunt me.

837
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,576
Did you give them the good news?
Good news?

838
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:50,086
Well, Akshay Kumar is
coming to town for shooting.

839
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:51,814
Really?

840
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,583
I am going to take his interview.

841
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:56,390
What are you saying?

842
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,451
He is a nice man. Family type man.

843
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:02,029
Good, Sonu.

844
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:03,896
I hope this hero
doesn't take Reena away.

845
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:05,162
How? On a flying saucer?

846
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:06,967
Will you have beer?
Yes. Why not?

847
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:08,902
No, uncle. Sonu won't drink.

848
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:11,032
He swings like a
child aftertwo pegs.

849
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:12,871
Yes. Mentally, he is a kid.

850
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:15,138
Raj, sirwants you to go
on yourfirst road trip.

851
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:16,838
Tonight.

852
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,109
You are going to New York. To
deliver an important package.

853
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,786
Is that so? You are also
coming along with the package?

854
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,420
You are right. I am
an important package.

855
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:29,482
But it's not your cup
of tea to send me back.

856
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,494
Don't worry. It's nothing illegal.
Nothing will happen to you.

857
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,462
Rajveer, you got to
handle some responsibility.

858
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:39,533
Underthis pretext you will
practice driving a truck too.

859
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:42,495
Sonu, please stop pulling Raj's leg.

860
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:44,135
Uncle Sammy.

861
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:47,172
Yes, son. Tell me. I wanted
to talk to you for a moment.

862
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:49,606
Yes. Tell me. - I think there
is some problem in the schedule.

863
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,477
Papa was saying I have
to go to New York tonight.

864
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:54,177
But I... - I had told the
office not to put you on schedule.

865
00:40:54,418 --> 00:40:56,181
If you go to New York,
how will you play hockey?

866
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:00,012
How long have you known, uncle?

867
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:02,923
Since the time you came to
me with yourfriend Deva.

868
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:06,424
You should have told yourfamily.
You know father.

869
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:07,657
How do I tell him?

870
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:10,222
He wants to see you successful,
Rajveer.

871
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,992
But he doesn't understand me.

872
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:17,004
Nephew, don't worry.
Go and show them.

873
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:20,435
Thanks, uncle. The
first goal will be for you.

874
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:22,138
Score a goal for your dad.

875
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:24,738
He loves you.
Uncle is the best.

876
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:28,879
Hi, mom. Today my dinner
is out. Okay? - Yes. I know.

877
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:30,614
That's why I have packed
potato stuffed flatbread.

878
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:33,623
Amazing, mom!
Tonight is very special for you.

879
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:37,058
You will like New York a lot.
Big Apple. - Yes.

880
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:40,562
This is yourfirst road trip.

881
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:43,056
Take this, son. - I still
remember my first road trip.

882
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:46,534
Take care of the truck.
It's a great truck.

883
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:49,071
Okay. Sure. I should be leaving now.

884
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:51,937
Come. Give me a hug.
He is very happy for you today.

885
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,777
May Lord be your savior! - Okay.
I will leave now. Thanks. - Bye.

886
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:58,778
I am very happy today.

887
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:02,075
Rajveer, you look great.
Fantastic. - Come on.

888
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:03,642
Alright, boys.
- That's it. Enough.

889
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:05,080
Enough.

890
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:09,051
It has started. And
all of you are ready.

891
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:11,753
Put your blood and sweat.

892
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,827
Coach, just give us a second.

893
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:18,525
Okay. - See you at the ice.
Fine. - Okay, coach.

894
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:21,070
Come on. Let us have a group huddle.

895
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:23,265
Come on. Come on.
Raj. - What?

896
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:25,266
Let's pray.

897
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,906
Okay. You need me?

898
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:33,716
Blessed is the person who says...

899
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:34,876
God is truth.

900
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:38,683
I welcome all of you to
the first Hyundai cup match.

901
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:41,919
Today, Speedy Singhs are
competing with Caliber.

902
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:43,892
Show them, Sardars.

903
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,286
Very good.

904
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:50,833
That playerwearing a helmet...

905
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:52,261
...isn't he Rajveer?

906
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,670
You recognized him now, you fool.

907
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,704
Lavleen, do you
remember God's photo?

908
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:00,667
I used to always keep it with me.

909
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,644
God has been so kind to us.

910
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:04,710
I am thinking of giving
this photo to Rajveer...

911
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:05,942
...before he leaves for New York.

912
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:08,314
Yes. Go and give him.
He must not have left.

913
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:11,146
Yes. I will be able to sleep
peacefully if God is with him.

914
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:13,985
Yes. Go and give him.
Give him my love.

915
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:15,889
Tell him to drive carefully.

916
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,086
I will tell him.

917
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:19,356
Pass it. Pass it.

918
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,133
Cut in. Come on.

919
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:27,998
Move it, man. Move it.

920
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:30,204
Go. Go.

921
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:37,909
And Rajveerfrom Speedy
Singhs has made a goal.

922
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:56,230
Rajveer, take God's
photo to New York with you.

923
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,827
The first match is between
Speedy Singhs and Caliber.

924
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:02,167
Where is Rajveer?
He has not come.

925
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:03,968
There are a lot of expectations.

926
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:07,374
Dan Winters is quite
excited about his team.

927
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:11,206
Let's see whetherthe team
lives up to the expectations.

928
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:17,820
It's a foul.

929
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,590
Very good.

930
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,655
Well done. Well done.
Great passing by them.

931
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:31,223
And a splendid goal for
Caliber in the second period.

932
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:33,197
Okay.

933
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:34,764
Come on. Buck up.

934
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:48,381
With this foul Speedy Singhs
get a penalty of two minutes.

935
00:44:58,462 --> 00:45:00,430
Caliber scores another goal.

936
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:01,589
In the third period.

937
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:04,691
With this Caliber is
ahead of Singhs, two to one.

938
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:09,728
Fine. I wanted to win.
But we played well.

939
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:11,399
We showed that we are there.

940
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:12,635
We showed many things.

941
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:15,569
Do you want to say something?

942
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,438
Yes.

943
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:18,879
Why to beat in the game?

944
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:23,350
He saved our honor and
showed that we know how to play.

945
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:24,546
Honor?

946
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,753
Honor is earned only by winning.

947
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:30,254
I think you are forgetting you
are the captain and I am the coach.

948
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:31,760
This is coach's game plan?

949
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:33,262
A stupid penalty.

950
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:34,854
Not at all. I have an easier plan.

951
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:36,593
You will do whatever I say.

952
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,265
This is fine.

953
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:42,632
You played well.
Thanks.

954
00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:49,738
Hey.

955
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:53,615
I think you are spending a
lot of time with my brother.

956
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:54,878
Yes. You are right.

957
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:57,352
There is same tension on yourface.

958
00:45:57,621 --> 00:45:59,612
Cheer up, captain. You played well.

959
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:01,983
Thanks. You should be in the class.

960
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:03,989
Yes. But as the team's lawyer,
it's important to watch...

961
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:05,957
...Speedy Singhs' matches.

962
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:09,760
Okay, lawyer. I want to
file a case on my coach.

963
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:12,597
You are upset because of the
penalty. - How do you know?

964
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:14,432
I understand ice hockey quite well.

965
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:16,268
I would be with Dan
in all his matches.

966
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:17,534
Was he good?

967
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:20,032
He was second rated in NHL.

968
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,609
Good skater. Good stick handler.

969
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:25,239
But a bad team player.

970
00:46:25,649 --> 00:46:28,482
His ego and anger ruined his career.

971
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:38,361
You keep his rookie card with you.

972
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:42,660
He was always a rookie.
So I am very emotional.

973
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:45,062
You don't like hockey players.

974
00:46:47,871 --> 00:46:50,704
I didn't say I don't
like hockey players.

975
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:52,332
I don't date them.

976
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:55,536
Until now.

977
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:06,853
Rajveer.

978
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:08,983
You fool.
Uncle.

979
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:11,527
How are you, son?
Soni. - Hi.

980
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:13,722
Don't worry. He knows everything.

981
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:17,460
Aftertoday's game you have
become famous all over Canada.

982
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:18,660
Famous.
Look.

983
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:20,293
Really? Even after losing?

984
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,361
Whether you win or lose,
what difference does it make?

985
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:24,407
We didn't have a team before.

986
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:27,910
Listen. Tomorrow we will
tell yourfather. Don't worry.

987
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:30,007
Fine, uncle.

988
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,707
But I will stay in
your house tonight.

989
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:32,874
I am in New York. Remember?

990
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:34,042
Yes. Surely.

991
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,812
Today, stay with Sonu.
Oh, no.

992
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:38,115
Take his autograph.

993
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:42,953
Listen. If you are lucky,
I will show you my tattoos.

994
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:46,052
If you don't wet your bed, I
will also show you many things.

995
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:48,654
What did you say? Okay. Okay.

996
00:47:48,732 --> 00:47:50,063
"Move back, beautiful damsel."

997
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:53,466
"Ourtrain is heading towards you."

998
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:01,008

999
998
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:04,744

1000
- It won't make a difference.

1001
00:48:07,285 --> 00:48:10,015
Who is Melissa?
Leave it.

1002
00:48:10,822 --> 00:48:11,880
Give it here.

1003
00:48:11,957 --> 00:48:15,324
What do you care about Melissa?
Relax.

1004
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:17,258
You can't score a
goal in the match...

1005
00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:18,956
...I doubt you will score in love.

1006
00:48:19,297 --> 00:48:21,993
And you can't tell your
parents about your game...

1007
00:48:22,067 --> 00:48:24,365
...what else can you tell them?
Are you done?

1008
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:26,096
Almost.

1009
00:48:26,705 --> 00:48:28,866
Go to sleep, my head's paining.

1010
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:32,034
Headache. That's your
family ailment, just like Reena.

1011
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:34,010
Someday you will make a good wife.

1012
00:48:36,281 --> 00:48:38,841
Sexy bed. Where will you sleep?

1013
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:41,215
I will sleep right here.
You can sleep with me here.

1014
00:48:41,286 --> 00:48:44,119
But I get really
naughty in the morning.

1015
00:48:44,189 --> 00:48:46,123
Naughty. Quite naughty.

1016
00:48:46,191 --> 00:48:47,249
Come on.

1017
00:48:47,325 --> 00:48:49,452
Seems like you don't like your nose.

1018
00:48:49,528 --> 00:48:51,428
Really? What a bad joke.

1019
00:48:51,496 --> 00:48:53,293
Elephant to the ant: "Look,
my mom's here".

1020
00:48:53,365 --> 00:48:54,457
Ant: "Quick, hide behind me."

1021
00:48:55,834 --> 00:48:56,926
Be quiet.

1022
00:48:57,269 --> 00:48:58,361
I will sleep on the floor.

1023
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:00,097
Do you want this pillow? - Yes.

1024
00:49:00,405 --> 00:49:01,497
Fine, take it.

1025
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:03,037
You know Reena's doggy Foo Foo.

1026
00:49:03,508 --> 00:49:04,839
Prefers this pillow as well.

1027
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:06,002
Oh no.

1028
00:49:07,245 --> 00:49:09,543
And don't use that blanket as well.
Why?

1029
00:49:09,781 --> 00:49:11,840
Because that is Reena
and my personal blanket.

1030
00:49:17,255 --> 00:49:18,950
I feel pity for you.

1031
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:22,852
Here.

1032
00:49:22,928 --> 00:49:24,225
You can use this as a blanket.

1033
00:49:29,568 --> 00:49:32,059
I nevertaught him to lie.

1034
00:49:32,137 --> 00:49:35,436
And Sammy. Even he hid this from me.

1035
00:49:36,041 --> 00:49:39,977
You asked your son
something that he loves the most.

1036
00:49:40,045 --> 00:49:42,275
So now it's my
fault that he is lying.

1037
00:49:42,547 --> 00:49:44,879
Even George Bush
doesn't lie this much.

1038
00:49:45,851 --> 00:49:49,343
Can you stop loving me
if someone asks you to?

1039
00:49:51,556 --> 00:49:54,992
I feel really angry when
you use these female points.

1040
00:49:55,927 --> 00:49:59,294
Which other points do
I have? - I don't know.

1041
00:50:03,435 --> 00:50:06,063
And if he's scared to
talk to talk to you...

1042
00:50:06,137 --> 00:50:07,502
...then you talk to him.

1043
00:50:08,139 --> 00:50:10,369
But please, just talk to him.

1044
00:50:10,442 --> 00:50:11,534
Don't lecture him.

1045
01:05:07,638 --> 01:05:08,696
Very good.

1046
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:11,503
I am very happy with what you did.

1047
01:05:11,742 --> 01:05:12,902
The singing, dancing. Drinking.

1048
01:05:13,811 --> 01:05:16,575
Fighting. All that was
left was getting locked up...

1049
01:05:16,647 --> 01:05:17,944
...but you took care of that as well.

1050
01:05:19,283 --> 01:05:22,946
But next time... keep my
sister away from all this.

1051
01:05:23,187 --> 01:05:24,484
Coach, I don't remember anything.

1052
01:05:24,555 --> 01:05:25,681
I don't know anything.

1053
01:05:29,326 --> 01:05:30,554
Get out of my locker room.

1054
01:05:31,896 --> 01:05:32,988
Come on.

1055
01:05:33,764 --> 01:05:35,959
I told you to invite
him to the party as well.

1056
01:05:39,537 --> 01:05:40,697
Coach.

1057
01:05:42,473 --> 01:05:43,565
I am sorry.

1058
01:05:44,408 --> 01:05:47,275
I take full responsibility of
whatever happened last night.

1059
01:05:47,511 --> 01:05:48,603
Good.

1060
01:05:49,013 --> 01:05:50,310
Nice to hearthat.

1061
01:05:51,482 --> 01:05:53,677
So everything's fine?
- Do you think everything's fine?

1062
01:05:57,788 --> 01:05:59,016
You aren't worthy of that.

1063
01:05:59,423 --> 01:06:01,550
You can't do that.
I just did.

1064
01:06:03,661 --> 01:06:05,720
Okay. Then I won't play.

1065
01:06:05,796 --> 01:06:07,696
We will win this game
and go to the finals.

1066
01:06:07,765 --> 01:06:10,233
We both know that it's
impossible without me.

1067
01:06:10,301 --> 01:06:13,031
Is that so?
Yes, It is.

1068
01:06:18,008 --> 01:06:20,533
Remember, once you
are out you are out.

1069
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:37,818
That's a stupid reason.

1070
01:06:38,262 --> 01:06:39,354
You can turn away from me...

1071
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:40,522
...but what will you say to yourself?

1072
01:06:40,598 --> 01:06:43,431
About what? About saving you?

1073
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,798
Saving me? You were
only saving your ego.

1074
01:06:45,870 --> 01:06:48,839
Just say what you understand.
Fine.

1075
01:06:48,906 --> 01:06:50,032
Let's talk about Hockey?

1076
01:06:50,274 --> 01:06:51,400
Just because Dan took away...

1077
01:06:51,475 --> 01:06:52,567
...the captainship
from you, that's why?

1078
01:06:52,643 --> 01:06:54,406
I left the team because...

1079
01:06:54,478 --> 01:06:55,877
...I don't want to hearfrom
someone who cleans the ice.

1080
01:06:55,946 --> 01:06:57,846
Let me tell you something, big man.

1081
01:06:58,282 --> 01:07:00,375
Come right here, behind the bench.

1082
01:07:00,851 --> 01:07:03,581
And remember, I don't like quitters.

1083
01:07:41,225 --> 01:07:43,250
Look, that's all there was left.

1084
01:07:44,428 --> 01:07:46,726
Hey, coach, sorry...
I am No longer your coach.

1085
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:53,932
I am sorry.

1086
01:07:54,004 --> 01:07:55,369
Look, I made a mistake.

1087
01:07:55,439 --> 01:07:57,066
I should play forthe team.

1088
01:07:57,708 --> 01:07:59,938
Wait. You think the
Speedy Singhs will lose...

1089
01:08:00,010 --> 01:08:01,170
...if you don't play?

1090
01:08:02,446 --> 01:08:03,538
Well, you are wrong.

1091
01:08:03,981 --> 01:08:05,073
They won.

1092
01:08:05,382 --> 01:08:07,282
We won?
Yes.

1093
01:08:07,351 --> 01:08:08,477
4-3, in the overtime.

1094
01:08:08,552 --> 01:08:10,713
We made it to the finals,
and without you.

1095
01:08:11,188 --> 01:08:12,314
That's great.

1096
01:08:12,389 --> 01:08:13,481
I don't believe it.
Yes.

1097
01:08:13,557 --> 01:08:15,252
Afterthe game the Hammerheads...

1098
01:08:15,326 --> 01:08:16,588
...lodged a complaint that Singhs...

1099
01:08:17,161 --> 01:08:19,391
...cannot play without a helmet.

1100
01:08:19,463 --> 01:08:20,691
Why didn't they do
anything until now?

1101
01:08:20,764 --> 01:08:23,756
I feel they never imagined
that you will make it this far.

1102
01:08:25,102 --> 01:08:27,536
They will nevertake off
theirturban to wearthe helmets.

1103
01:08:27,972 --> 01:08:29,462
So it's no use now.

1104
01:08:48,492 --> 01:08:50,323
Daddy, I was scared.

1105
01:08:50,394 --> 01:08:51,520
Daddy, look at him.

1106
01:08:51,595 --> 01:08:54,996
I am scared he might beat us too.

1107
01:08:55,065 --> 01:08:57,124
No, son, no one will hurt you.

1108
01:08:57,201 --> 01:08:58,361
Always remember.

1109
01:08:58,435 --> 01:09:00,027
When the Lord's your benefactor...

1110
01:09:00,104 --> 01:09:01,662
...no one can hurt you.

1111
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:05,675
Our Guru has blessed
us with this turban.

1112
01:09:05,743 --> 01:09:07,108
He gave us his blessings.

1113
01:09:07,177 --> 01:09:09,577
Rememberthat? Understand. Look.

1114
01:09:10,047 --> 01:09:11,344
This is the Golden Temple.

1115
01:09:11,415 --> 01:09:13,144
I will take you there.
Akshay Kumar.

1116
01:09:13,217 --> 01:09:16,243
Next year I will take
you and your motherthere.

1117
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:19,816
But how can ourturban protect us?

1118
01:09:20,391 --> 01:09:22,450
I will tell you how.

1119
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:26,687
Look, this turban is our crown.

1120
01:09:27,297 --> 01:09:28,696
It's our inner strength.

1121
01:09:29,233 --> 01:09:30,791
History stands witness, son.

1122
01:09:31,035 --> 01:09:35,836
Whoever cast an evil on us,
always faced destruction.

1123
01:09:36,073 --> 01:09:38,405
The Sikhs have won so many wars...

1124
01:09:38,475 --> 01:09:40,409
...due to the grace of this turban.

1125
01:09:40,477 --> 01:09:44,277
And you know...
Daddy, who is he?

1126
01:09:45,582 --> 01:09:48,073
He is our great
emperor Kng Ranjit Singh.

1127
01:09:48,352 --> 01:09:49,614
He showed the world that...

1128
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:52,120
...our Guru has turned us
into fearless warriors.

1129
01:09:53,257 --> 01:09:56,385
Glory to Lord Guru!
- Glory to Lord Guru!

1130
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:58,121
My brave son.

1131
01:09:58,195 --> 01:09:59,321
My brave son.

1132
01:09:59,797 --> 01:10:01,196
Cut it.

1133
01:10:01,265 --> 01:10:02,493
That's a cut.

1134
01:10:04,134 --> 01:10:05,226
Here.

1135
01:10:06,403 --> 01:10:07,495
Great shot.

1136
01:10:07,571 --> 01:10:09,835
Yes.
Can I Have an autograph? - Sure.

1137
01:10:14,378 --> 01:10:15,470
Thank you.

1138
01:10:15,546 --> 01:10:17,104
Name?
Darvesh.

1139
01:10:17,181 --> 01:10:19,741
Darvesh.
- It's for my father.

1140
01:10:21,518 --> 01:10:23,577
Father. Interesting.

1141
01:10:23,854 --> 01:10:25,412
He is Rajveer Singh.

1142
01:10:26,123 --> 01:10:27,556
Ice-hockey captain.

1143
01:10:27,624 --> 01:10:29,592
I mentioned about him earlier.
Oh Yes.

1144
01:10:29,893 --> 01:10:31,155
Nice meeting you.

1145
01:10:31,228 --> 01:10:32,320
Speedy Singh.
Yes.

1146
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:34,856
It's an honour meeting you.
I wish that was True.

1147
01:10:35,099 --> 01:10:36,430
I am working on it.

1148
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:39,567
Well, I wish I could come and
watch yourfinals. - Me too.

1149
01:10:41,171 --> 01:10:42,832
Anyway, good luck.

1150
01:10:42,906 --> 01:10:44,669
And if you win the party is on me.

1151
01:10:44,741 --> 01:10:46,606
Thank you.
Goodbye.

1152
01:10:47,311 --> 01:10:48,403
See you.

1153
01:10:58,722 --> 01:11:00,417
Maybe this will work.

1154
01:11:00,791 --> 01:11:02,588
But it will cost dearly.

1155
01:11:02,659 --> 01:11:04,820
Do you think you can
get this done in a week?

1156
01:11:05,829 --> 01:11:07,160
Yes, of course.

1157
01:11:07,631 --> 01:11:09,258
Where did you get this money from?

1158
01:11:09,766 --> 01:11:12,326
Trucking.
By driving trucks.

1159
01:11:15,472 --> 01:11:17,667
What's the league's
problem with us wearing a turban?

1160
01:11:17,741 --> 01:11:19,333
Coach.
What are they saying

1161
01:11:21,411 --> 01:11:22,537
Okay, we are all here.

1162
01:11:22,846 --> 01:11:23,938
Tell us what you wanted to.

1163
01:11:24,181 --> 01:11:26,911
I think it will be
better if Raj tells you.

1164
01:11:28,619 --> 01:11:29,677
What are you doing here?

1165
01:11:29,753 --> 01:11:31,186
This is ourteam meeting.

1166
01:11:31,622 --> 01:11:32,714
First thing.

1167
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:34,916
Friends, please forgive me.

1168
01:11:37,694 --> 01:11:39,821
You all deserve this championship.

1169
01:11:39,897 --> 01:11:41,387
Much more than that.

1170
01:11:41,698 --> 01:11:42,892
That's not possible, friend.

1171
01:11:42,966 --> 01:11:44,524
We won't take off the turban.

1172
01:11:45,435 --> 01:11:46,595
We have hit dead end.

1173
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:48,865
End of story.
I heard.

1174
01:11:49,506 --> 01:11:52,805
But I learnt a lot seeing
the courage of this team.

1175
01:11:54,178 --> 01:11:57,670
Coach, I don't deserve to
be the captain of this team.

1176
01:11:57,948 --> 01:11:59,245
Is that all you want to say?

1177
01:12:00,651 --> 01:12:01,743
No.

1178
01:12:05,556 --> 01:12:06,648
Look.

1179
01:12:06,957 --> 01:12:09,892
What is this?
What is this?

1180
01:12:11,628 --> 01:12:14,461
Centuries ago, the
Gurus wore this in wars.

1181
01:12:14,898 --> 01:12:18,390
Now you all will protect
our respect and honour.

1182
01:12:18,802 --> 01:12:21,396
But this time, the
warwill be on the ice.

1183
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:24,532
Listen, listen, listen.
Just a minute. Just a minute.

1184
01:12:24,608 --> 01:12:26,633
The officials won't
allow us to wearthis.

1185
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:28,610
By the way, your
sister has informed them...

1186
01:12:28,679 --> 01:12:30,544
...how they can be worn.

1187
01:12:30,614 --> 01:12:32,946
Friends, with your permission.

1188
01:12:33,383 --> 01:12:36,614
According to Civil Court
Part one section eight...

1189
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:40,550
...my clients are being
stopped from following theirfaith.

1190
01:12:41,491 --> 01:12:44,255
That's a human rights violation.

1191
01:12:45,395 --> 01:12:46,555
That's right.

1192
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:47,756
Good point.

1193
01:12:48,532 --> 01:12:50,329
I don't know whether
this will work or not.

1194
01:12:50,567 --> 01:12:52,034
It already has.

1195
01:12:53,704 --> 01:12:56,867
And Raj has paid for
this from his savings.

1196
01:12:57,708 --> 01:13:00,677
And you can return it by
defeating Hammerheads.

1197
01:13:01,778 --> 01:13:02,870
Good luck.

1198
01:13:04,281 --> 01:13:05,475
Come on, coach.
Coach, please.

1199
01:13:05,549 --> 01:13:08,950
Friends. I told him if
he leaves he's gone.

1200
01:13:09,019 --> 01:13:10,384
And I am true to my words.

1201
01:13:12,823 --> 01:13:16,281
But I nevertold him that
I will nevertake him back.

1202
01:13:36,348 --> 01:13:40,079
"Wearwedding turban with
full moon studed on it"

1203
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,546
"Wearwedding turban with
full moon studed on it"

1204
01:13:44,623 --> 01:13:47,023
"Today is the occassion of
your life time"

1205
01:13:47,125 --> 01:13:51,892
"Let's celetrate today,
our brother is going to mary"

1206
01:13:52,164 --> 01:13:54,029
"Brother is going to get maried"

1207
01:13:54,132 --> 01:13:56,259
"Let's all of us celeberate"

1208
01:13:56,334 --> 01:13:58,063
"Brother is goint to get married"

1209
01:13:58,170 --> 01:14:01,003
"Let's all of us celeberate"

1210
01:14:03,775 --> 01:14:09,145
"Went on to toil for 12 years,
afterwhich he brought love"

1211
01:14:09,214 --> 01:14:14,049
"Went on to toil for 12 years,
afterwhich he brought love"

1212
01:14:14,119 --> 01:14:16,485
"The wedding crown only looks good"

1213
01:14:16,955 --> 01:14:20,914
"Wedding crown only looks good
where groom's friends dance"

1214
01:14:20,992 --> 01:14:26,430
"Wedding crown only looks good
where groom's friends dance"

1215
01:14:29,201 --> 01:14:32,398
Excuse me! Please excuse me!

1216
01:14:32,504 --> 01:14:33,596
What? What happened?

1217
01:14:33,738 --> 01:14:35,433
Rina refuses to come out of her room.

1218
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:36,632
But, why? - I don't know.

1219
01:14:36,741 --> 01:14:38,072
Oh, she is a devil!

1220
01:14:38,143 --> 01:14:39,906
She's is putting us down.
- Groom here already.

1221
01:14:39,978 --> 01:14:40,876
Go talk to him.

1222
01:14:44,049 --> 01:14:45,311
Go talk to your bride.

1223
01:14:45,483 --> 01:14:46,575
Why, what's wrong.

1224
01:14:47,018 --> 01:14:49,077
Just go, please.
In the dressing room.

1225
01:14:55,827 --> 01:14:56,919
Reena.

1226
01:14:59,798 --> 01:15:01,390
Reena, what are you doing?

1227
01:15:02,334 --> 01:15:03,426
What happened?

1228
01:15:03,502 --> 01:15:06,164
I don't know if I'll be
going ahead with this marriage.

1229
01:15:06,538 --> 01:15:08,130
You are telling me now.

1230
01:15:08,406 --> 01:15:12,433
I feel sometimes you
become so selfish.

1231
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:14,775
You just want everything to
be the way you want it to be.

1232
01:15:14,846 --> 01:15:15,972
Not everything.

1233
01:15:16,047 --> 01:15:18,811
You came to my party and got drunk...

1234
01:15:18,884 --> 01:15:20,283
...even though you knew
that you can't digest it.

1235
01:15:20,352 --> 01:15:22,786
That was a party. - You don't
everwatch me reading news either.

1236
01:15:22,854 --> 01:15:24,048
I watch you all the time.

1237
01:15:24,122 --> 01:15:25,350
What was I wearing on Thursday?

1238
01:15:25,924 --> 01:15:27,858
Purple. Green. Sea green.

1239
01:15:27,926 --> 01:15:30,895
No. Red silk blouse tucked
into a bellbottom jeans.

1240
01:15:30,962 --> 01:15:33,362
What difference does that make?
I mean I record news.

1241
01:15:33,832 --> 01:15:36,198
Do you actually think we
are right for each other?

1242
01:15:36,401 --> 01:15:40,098
Look Reena, I have never
felt like this about anyone.

1243
01:15:41,473 --> 01:15:45,170
Reena, I have nothing except you.

1244
01:15:47,012 --> 01:15:48,809
I will try not to
think about myself.

1245
01:15:50,982 --> 01:15:52,347
I am kind of rascally.

1246
01:15:52,417 --> 01:15:53,850
But I have no control overthat.

1247
01:15:57,355 --> 01:16:00,882
I know. I know only you
can make me a better man.

1248
01:16:02,093 --> 01:16:03,151
Only you.

1249
01:16:13,838 --> 01:16:14,896
Alright.

1250
01:16:19,878 --> 01:16:21,505
Thank God you came out.
Sorry.

1251
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:23,207
I have parked my
elephant in the no parking zone.

1252
01:16:24,282 --> 01:16:25,510
I might get a ticket forthat.

1253
01:16:28,887 --> 01:16:30,514
Teach him to at
least button his shirt.

1254
01:16:30,922 --> 01:16:32,014
Please calm down.

1255
01:16:32,090 --> 01:16:34,524
They will come.
I am calm. - You are not.

1256
01:16:49,107 --> 01:16:50,199
I'm sorry, dad.

1257
01:16:52,110 --> 01:16:54,305
Come, my Punjabi son. Rajveer Singh.

1258
01:16:54,379 --> 01:16:56,574
Welcome. Come home now. Okay?

1259
01:16:59,851 --> 01:17:01,079
Come on. Come on.

1260
01:17:01,152 --> 01:17:03,620
God bless. - Come on. It's
time forthe nuptial rounds.

1261
01:17:05,056 --> 01:17:07,957
Come on. Come on. Please.

1262
01:17:08,026 --> 01:17:09,186
Coming.

1263
01:17:54,005 --> 01:17:57,031
Ladies and Gentlemen,
this day is no ordinary day.

1264
01:17:57,375 --> 01:18:00,003
And not because I'm getting
married to my beautiful wife.

1265
01:18:00,345 --> 01:18:02,905
But because our reception will
take place at a hockey match.

1266
01:18:03,915 --> 01:18:05,439
My brother Rajveer
will play in that.

1267
01:18:05,884 --> 01:18:07,351
And my wife will cover it.

1268
01:18:13,391 --> 01:18:14,483
Go Speedy Singhs.

1269
01:18:15,427 --> 01:18:17,895
Seek His blessings.
And return victorious.

1270
01:18:18,430 --> 01:18:24,096
Whoever utters His
name shall be happy.

1271
01:18:25,937 --> 01:18:27,461
This is crazy.

1272
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:32,503
These guys are spoiling the marriage
function for a hockey match.

1273
01:18:32,577 --> 01:18:33,942
This is foolishness.

1274
01:18:37,816 --> 01:18:38,908
Give me your hand.

1275
01:18:39,184 --> 01:18:40,549
And you're not going anywhere.

1276
01:18:43,154 --> 01:18:45,088
This is forthe championship,
father.

1277
01:18:46,458 --> 01:18:47,789
And I am playing.

1278
01:18:48,593 --> 01:18:50,390
I will really like it if you come.

1279
01:18:50,462 --> 01:18:51,554
No.

1280
01:18:53,064 --> 01:18:54,156
Go.

1281
01:18:54,833 --> 01:18:56,926
It's an auspicious day.
I will stay here.

1282
01:19:03,942 --> 01:19:05,466
Life is full of surprises, isn't it?

1283
01:19:07,112 --> 01:19:08,340
I don't like surprises.

1284
01:19:10,048 --> 01:19:11,447
Your son is special.

1285
01:19:12,283 --> 01:19:13,841
You must watch him play.

1286
01:19:14,586 --> 01:19:16,053
You might change your mind.

1287
01:19:25,597 --> 01:19:28,998
Great. Are they here forthe
hockey match or a wedding?

1288
01:19:29,067 --> 01:19:30,864
This must be the
biggest Punjabi contingent...

1289
01:19:30,935 --> 01:19:32,027
...everto watch a hockey match.

1290
01:19:32,103 --> 01:19:34,936
It's time forthe
finals of the Hyundai Cup.

1291
01:19:35,006 --> 01:19:38,339
Underdogs Speedy Singhs
Vs favorites Hammerheads.

1292
01:19:38,409 --> 01:19:42,038
Speedy Singhs performance has
won the hearts of the Canadians.

1293
01:19:42,113 --> 01:19:44,240
This is Reena Singh from SIN.

1294
01:19:44,315 --> 01:19:45,646
And I just got married.

1295
01:19:52,123 --> 01:19:53,852
All of you actually
look like warriors.

1296
01:19:56,327 --> 01:19:57,419
Thank you, Mr. Singh.

1297
01:20:03,201 --> 01:20:04,293
Thank you, coach.

1298
01:20:04,936 --> 01:20:05,994
Come on, Raj.

1299
01:20:06,437 --> 01:20:07,563
Come on, guys.

1300
01:20:18,349 --> 01:20:20,214
I could've never
done this without you.

1301
01:20:20,485 --> 01:20:21,952
Don't mention it.

1302
01:20:22,587 --> 01:20:25,283
Some things are better left unsaid.

1303
01:20:32,197 --> 01:20:33,289
Thank you.

1304
01:20:39,604 --> 01:20:41,003
Go Speedy Singhs.

1305
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:43,963
"Punjabis are bravehearts."

1306
01:20:54,252 --> 01:20:55,913
Rock it! Go for it.

1307
01:20:58,556 --> 01:21:01,923
Speedy Singhs are wearing
the warrior Sikh helmets.

1308
01:21:01,993 --> 01:21:04,257
They look like
warriors ready for battle.

1309
01:21:10,635 --> 01:21:11,727
You saw those jokers?

1310
01:21:20,879 --> 01:21:23,439
"Punjabis are bravehearts."

1311
01:21:23,948 --> 01:21:25,040
Absolutely, Absolutely.

1312
01:21:25,116 --> 01:21:28,449
Today we'll find out if
Rajveer lives up to the hype.

1313
01:21:28,853 --> 01:21:36,589
'O Canada, our
home and native land.'

1314
01:21:37,428 --> 01:21:45,335
'True patriot love in
all thy sons command.'

1315
01:21:45,570 --> 01:21:50,473
'With glowing hearts
we see thee rise.'

1316
01:21:50,541 --> 01:21:55,137
'The True North strong and free! '

1317
01:21:55,914 --> 01:22:04,219
'From far and wide, O Canada,
we stand on guard forthee.'

1318
01:22:05,156 --> 01:22:09,525
'God keep our land
glorious and free! '

1319
01:22:10,361 --> 01:22:14,320
Alright. Boys, it's time.

1320
01:22:16,968 --> 01:22:18,060
Team work.

1321
01:22:18,436 --> 01:22:19,664
One, two, three.

1322
01:22:19,904 --> 01:22:21,030
Singhs!

1323
01:22:24,375 --> 01:22:26,172
Go, Tanveer.

1324
01:22:36,087 --> 01:22:37,611
That's a nice bucket on your head.

1325
01:22:39,924 --> 01:22:41,687
'Rajveer Singh has been
pushed away from the puck.'

1326
01:22:41,926 --> 01:22:43,553
'Hammer heads have put
in the Singhs zone.'

1327
01:22:44,162 --> 01:22:45,390
Come. Have a seat.

1328
01:22:50,001 --> 01:22:51,901
'They're taking a shot
from the corner point.'

1329
01:22:51,970 --> 01:22:54,632
'Lnderjit saves it.' 'But it
has rebounded and they score.'

1330
01:22:56,441 --> 01:22:58,068
This is just the beginning.

1331
01:22:58,343 --> 01:22:59,708
One minute into the game,
the Hammerheads...

1332
01:22:59,944 --> 01:23:01,172
...are leading by 1-0.

1333
01:23:04,115 --> 01:23:06,583
'There are more than 3 minutes
remaining in the first round.'

1334
01:23:06,651 --> 01:23:09,950
'And Hammerheads are
still leading by 1-0.'

1335
01:23:10,321 --> 01:23:12,346
Speedy Singhs have put
into the Hammerheads zone.

1336
01:23:12,423 --> 01:23:13,651
They've lost the Puck at the corner.

1337
01:23:13,725 --> 01:23:16,057
And Rajveer has been hit.

1338
01:23:16,694 --> 01:23:17,956
Oh my God!

1339
01:23:18,029 --> 01:23:19,087
What a hit!

1340
01:23:19,163 --> 01:23:21,495
Hey! Where is the goal?

1341
01:23:22,367 --> 01:23:23,959
Referee, are you blind?

1342
01:23:24,035 --> 01:23:25,161
He is blind.

1343
01:23:27,105 --> 01:23:29,266
O poor kid. Are you hurt?

1344
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:30,432
Get lost.

1345
01:23:35,079 --> 01:23:37,673
I'll smack the referee. Jerk.

1346
01:23:37,749 --> 01:23:39,307
'This is bad.'

1347
01:23:39,384 --> 01:23:41,284
'We need assistance to
take him back to the bench.'

1348
01:23:41,352 --> 01:23:44,185
'He is badly hurt.' 'I hope
they don't sit him on the bench.'

1349
01:23:44,255 --> 01:23:48,248
'They need his talent badly
against the mighty Hammerheads.'

1350
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:51,594
We're having lots of
troubles there.

1351
01:23:52,230 --> 01:23:55,996
Leku, go and destroy them.

1352
01:23:56,067 --> 01:23:57,125
Got it?

1353
01:23:59,203 --> 01:24:00,329
How are you now?

1354
01:24:00,605 --> 01:24:01,697
Absolutely fine.

1355
01:24:02,306 --> 01:24:03,773
If I see anything wrong...

1356
01:24:04,008 --> 01:24:05,532
...I will come to get you.

1357
01:24:06,310 --> 01:24:07,743
Only if you can catch me.

1358
01:24:11,549 --> 01:24:13,176
They are still leading by a goal.

1359
01:24:13,251 --> 01:24:14,650
The pace is picking up.

1360
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:16,311
There are just three
minutes remaining.

1361
01:24:17,055 --> 01:24:18,784
A hard hit on the boundary.

1362
01:24:19,724 --> 01:24:21,385
Speedy Singhs have
changed their line.

1363
01:24:23,194 --> 01:24:24,627
Rajveer Singh has
picked it up from the line.

1364
01:24:24,695 --> 01:24:26,128
Put it in the Hammerhead zone.

1365
01:24:26,197 --> 01:24:27,687
And has taken out the defender.

1366
01:24:27,765 --> 01:24:29,596
And he can score.

1367
01:24:29,667 --> 01:24:31,760
But he has passed it to Jassi Singh.

1368
01:24:32,003 --> 01:24:33,595
And a goal!

1369
01:24:33,671 --> 01:24:37,038
Goal. Outstanding.
Well done.

1370
01:24:37,108 --> 01:24:38,370
What a goal.

1371
01:24:38,443 --> 01:24:39,740
Good. Very good.

1372
01:24:42,847 --> 01:24:44,872
We are starting the third period.

1373
01:24:44,949 --> 01:24:46,041
Everyone is together.

1374
01:24:46,117 --> 01:24:48,984
Friends, the game has
become more interesting.

1375
01:24:50,321 --> 01:24:52,289
Singhs have put the puck
into the Hammerheads zone.

1376
01:24:52,356 --> 01:24:53,880
And they have lost it.

1377
01:24:54,258 --> 01:24:56,783
Churchnick has put back
it to the center line.

1378
01:24:56,861 --> 01:24:57,919
Rajveer has cut the pass.

1379
01:24:57,995 --> 01:25:01,021
And has put the puck overthe
blue line of the Hammerheads.

1380
01:25:01,099 --> 01:25:02,396
He has the puck now.

1381
01:25:02,467 --> 01:25:05,493
He is dodging and
dunking the opposition.

1382
01:25:05,570 --> 01:25:07,231
And he has scored.

1383
01:25:07,538 --> 01:25:10,336
A beautiful goal by Rajveer.

1384
01:25:14,512 --> 01:25:17,913
Speedy Singhs are leading by 2-1
forthe first time in the game.

1385
01:25:18,182 --> 01:25:20,514
The entire stadium has erupted.

1386
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:24,110
Hammerhead has control over it now.

1387
01:25:25,490 --> 01:25:26,957
There are is just one
minute remaining in the game.

1388
01:25:27,024 --> 01:25:29,390
And the Hammerheads
goal keeper is going out.

1389
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:31,951
And a new attacker is replacing him.

1390
01:25:32,597 --> 01:25:33,859
Careful.

1391
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:38,068
Picking it up from the corner.
Passing the puck.

1392
01:25:38,136 --> 01:25:39,569
Passing it again.

1393
01:25:39,637 --> 01:25:41,002
This is a difficult shot.

1394
01:25:41,072 --> 01:25:43,097
Oh! What a save by Jassi Singh!

1395
01:25:43,875 --> 01:25:45,001
Rajveer has it now.

1396
01:25:45,076 --> 01:25:48,637
He is off with it. He has
passed it to Deva Singh.

1397
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:50,313
He takes aim at the unguarded goal.

1398
01:25:50,381 --> 01:25:53,441
Amazing. This goal
could seal Singhs victory.

1399
01:25:53,518 --> 01:25:55,281
Yes. Yes.

1400
01:25:55,353 --> 01:25:57,651
Oh. But he has saved it.

1401
01:25:57,889 --> 01:25:59,447
To the goal. To the goal.

1402
01:25:59,524 --> 01:26:02,186
Libiyu has the puck now.
He passes it to Martin.

1403
01:26:02,260 --> 01:26:04,160
The Singhs are already celebrating.

1404
01:26:04,228 --> 01:26:05,320
They must go back.

1405
01:26:05,396 --> 01:26:06,522
But they aren't able to.

1406
01:26:06,597 --> 01:26:09,157
Martin is unmarked.
And he has scored.

1407
01:26:09,233 --> 01:26:11,360
Oh. And time up.

1408
01:26:11,435 --> 01:26:12,527
And both the teams are even now.

1409
01:26:12,603 --> 01:26:13,661
We are into overtime now.

1410
01:26:13,905 --> 01:26:15,338
This is really disappointing.

1411
01:26:15,406 --> 01:26:16,634
Victory was within Singhs grasp.

1412
01:26:16,874 --> 01:26:18,102
Now the team that
scores first in extra time...

1413
01:26:18,176 --> 01:26:20,872
...will be the winner
of the Hyundai Cup.

1414
01:26:22,013 --> 01:26:23,173
Okay. Come on.

1415
01:26:23,481 --> 01:26:24,539
No worries.

1416
01:26:24,949 --> 01:26:26,007
Listen to me.

1417
01:26:26,083 --> 01:26:29,109
All I've known is that
winning is everything.

1418
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:31,581
And we can do this
right here right now.

1419
01:26:32,690 --> 01:26:37,059
But you guys. You guys can
do something more than this.

1420
01:26:38,896 --> 01:26:41,364
About which I had never
thought before meeting you guys.

1421
01:26:41,699 --> 01:26:45,032
Tonight, you can show
the entire country...

1422
01:26:45,369 --> 01:26:46,495
...that you belong here.

1423
01:26:47,939 --> 01:26:50,134
Yes. I know you look different.

1424
01:26:50,341 --> 01:26:53,333
But if you go there and
do what I know you can do.

1425
01:26:53,411 --> 01:26:56,209
It will be clear
that you are champions.

1426
01:26:57,281 --> 01:26:58,339
Not them.

1427
01:27:03,221 --> 01:27:04,347
Three for Singhs.

1428
01:27:05,556 --> 01:27:06,921
One, two, three.

1429
01:27:06,991 --> 01:27:08,219
Singhs, Singhs, Singhs.

1430
01:27:08,292 --> 01:27:09,657
Singhs, Singhs, Singhs.

1431
01:27:09,727 --> 01:27:11,422
Singhs, Singhs, Singhs...

1432
01:27:11,495 --> 01:27:13,053
The extra time will start now.

1433
01:27:13,130 --> 01:27:15,428
Both the teams are super charged.

1434
01:27:15,499 --> 01:27:18,059
The team that scores
first will the champion...

1435
01:27:18,135 --> 01:27:21,127
...of this year's Hyundia Cup.

1436
01:27:21,205 --> 01:27:23,605
Singhs, Singhs, Singhs.

1437
01:27:23,674 --> 01:27:26,302
Singhs, Singhs, Singhs.

1438
01:27:26,377 --> 01:27:30,609
Singhs, Singhs, Singhs...

1439
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:38,316
Your dreams of winning
will be destroyed for good.

1440
01:27:38,556 --> 01:27:39,921
This is the day of reckoning.

1441
01:27:43,294 --> 01:27:44,989
And the game begins again.

1442
01:27:45,062 --> 01:27:46,654
Both teams have swapped sides.

1443
01:27:46,731 --> 01:27:49,962
Hammerheads entering the
Singhs zone with the puck.

1444
01:27:50,034 --> 01:27:51,558
Morton is moving ahead.

1445
01:27:51,636 --> 01:27:53,194
He has picked up the
puck from the corner.

1446
01:27:53,271 --> 01:27:55,171
Rajveer Singh's
fabulous intervention.

1447
01:27:55,239 --> 01:27:56,331
And the puck is out again.

1448
01:27:56,574 --> 01:27:57,939
Morton still has the puck.

1449
01:27:58,009 --> 01:27:59,567
He has passed it to Libiyu.

1450
01:27:59,644 --> 01:28:01,009
Morton gets the pass again.

1451
01:28:01,078 --> 01:28:02,545
Morton passes it to Basal.

1452
01:28:02,613 --> 01:28:03,739
Basal has the puck.

1453
01:28:03,814 --> 01:28:05,304
He has passed it to
Churchnick Churchnick I's attempt.

1454
01:28:05,549 --> 01:28:06,846
What a save by the goalie.

1455
01:28:06,917 --> 01:28:08,111
Basal has the puck again.

1456
01:28:08,185 --> 01:28:09,243
Another attempt.

1457
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:11,015
And he has saved it again. Amazing.

1458
01:28:11,088 --> 01:28:13,056
