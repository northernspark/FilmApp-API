<i>If you asked me now who I am,</i>

3
00:00:44,403 --> 00:00:46,266
<i>the only answer I could give
with any certainty</i>

4
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:49,478
<i>would be my name,
Charles Ryder.</i>

5
00:00:50,803 --> 00:00:55,236
<i>For the rest,
my loves, my hates,</i>

6
00:00:55,304 --> 00:00:58,031
<i>down even to my deepest desires,</i>

7
00:00:58,103 --> 00:01:01,365
<i>I can no longer say whether
these emotions are my own</i>

8
00:01:02,903 --> 00:01:06,461
<i>or stolen from those
I once so desperately wished to be.</i>

9
00:01:09,137 --> 00:01:13,194
<i>On second thoughts,
one emotion remains my own,</i>

10
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,730
<i>alone among the borrowed
and the second-hand,</i>

11
00:01:19,238 --> 00:01:22,692
<i>as pure as that faith
from which I am still in flight.</i>

12
00:01:25,538 --> 00:01:26,764
<i>Guilt.</i>

13
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:54,205
Been away, sir? Anywhere interesting?

14
00:01:54,272 --> 00:01:57,295
- Jungle.
- Jungle.

15
00:01:58,906 --> 00:02:00,064
Explorer, are we?

16
00:02:00,139 --> 00:02:02,970
- Painter.
- Painter?

17
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,165
So, bye-bye beardy, hello smooth.

18
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,663
Famous for his impressive
architectural portraits,

19
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:26,069
British artist Charles Ryder
has taken New York by storm

20
00:02:26,173 --> 00:02:29,038
with a series of gripping jungle studies.

21
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,732
To own a Ryder is currently the dream

22
00:02:30,807 --> 00:02:32,602
of every self-respecting
East Coast millionaire.

23
00:02:33,774 --> 00:02:36,535
You must be so proud of him.

24
00:02:36,607 --> 00:02:39,130
- Was he away long?
- Two years,

25
00:02:39,207 --> 00:02:43,162
- and it doesn't feel like a day.
- You must feel positively bridal.

26
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,868
I can't paint
to save my life.

27
00:02:45,941 --> 00:02:46,964
Thank you.

28
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,405
I can't even hold a buggering brush!

29
00:02:49,474 --> 00:02:55,737
But I know what I like. Lots of color.
Nice and bright.

30
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:58,968
I see the jungle in your work
as a metaphor.

31
00:02:59,075 --> 00:03:04,098
Not least, the metaphysical semblance
of the chaos at the heart of civilization.

32
00:03:04,175 --> 00:03:06,004
Make an effort, Charles.

33
00:03:06,075 --> 00:03:10,064
You're not in South America now.
You're amongst civilized people.

34
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,408
- Mr. Ryder, I wonder if I could...
- I'm so sorry. Excuse me.

35
00:03:52,476 --> 00:03:54,704
- Excuse me. Thank you very much.
...just have a conversation...

36
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,636
Hello, Charles.

37
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:09,972
- You're wearing a coat!
- Yes, Father, I am.

38
00:06:10,049 --> 00:06:11,947
Why?

39
00:06:12,015 --> 00:06:15,504
- I'm going up to Oxford.
- Ah. Yes.

40
00:06:18,616 --> 00:06:22,207
- Remind me. What are you taking?
- History.

41
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:25,373
- And what allowance have I given you?
- A hundred pounds.

42
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:29,439
How very indulgent of me.
Mind you, it all comes out of capital.

43
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,773
Oh, I suppose this is the time
I should give you advice.

44
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,975
Your mother was always
so good at that.

45
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,014
Who's meeting you?

46
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,913
Cousin Jasper offered
to show me around.

47
00:06:45,984 --> 00:06:47,540
Cousin Jasper!

48
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,382
Most entertaining.

49
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:33,783
Out of the way,
you silly fool.

50
00:07:33,852 --> 00:07:35,909
There you are, Charles.

51
00:07:36,752 --> 00:07:38,411
This way, please.

52
00:07:40,986 --> 00:07:45,180
Come along. As an only child,
you will, of course, have much to learn.

53
00:07:45,253 --> 00:07:48,912
Though I am only your cousin, Charles,
you must look upon me as a brother.

54
00:07:48,986 --> 00:07:51,850
Older, wiser,
but a brother nevertheless.

55
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,942
Now, it is no secret that our families
are not rich in material wealth.

56
00:07:56,019 --> 00:07:57,349
Keep off the grass.

57
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:03,081
But I like to think that we Ryders are,
all of us, rich in the striving of minds.

58
00:08:03,153 --> 00:08:04,710
Now, then... Not that way.

59
00:08:04,787 --> 00:08:08,344
Clothes. Dress as you do
in a country house.

60
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:12,012
Never wear a tweed coat
and a flannel trousers, always a suit.

61
00:08:12,087 --> 00:08:14,553
And go to a London tailor.
You'll get a better cut.

62
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,246
Protocol. First and foremost,
behaving with restraint...

63
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:24,117
Nine adulteries, 12 liaisons,
64 fornications,

64
00:08:24,187 --> 00:08:26,619
and something approaching a rape

65
00:08:26,688 --> 00:08:32,087
rest nightly upon the soul
of our delicate friend Florialis,

66
00:08:32,155 --> 00:08:34,985
and yet the man is so
quiet and reserved in demeanor

67
00:08:35,055 --> 00:08:38,919
that he passes
for both bloodless and sexless.

68
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:45,814
Sodomites, all of them. Steer well clear.

69
00:08:48,722 --> 00:08:51,347
Treat all dons
as you would the local vicar.

70
00:08:51,422 --> 00:08:53,479
With indifference.

71
00:08:53,555 --> 00:08:58,215
Oh, dear, oh, dear. This won't do at all.
You must change your rooms.

72
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,187
I've seen many a man ruined

73
00:09:00,256 --> 00:09:03,416
through having ground floor rooms
in the front quad.

74
00:09:03,522 --> 00:09:05,045
People start dropping in.

75
00:09:05,122 --> 00:09:08,247
They leave their gowns here
and come and collect them before hall.

76
00:09:08,323 --> 00:09:11,187
You start giving them sherry
and before you know it they're...

77
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:19,956
Sebastian, come along.
Look at the state of him.

78
00:09:20,023 --> 00:09:22,012
Come on, you're nearly clean.

79
00:09:29,424 --> 00:09:32,049
Oh, no, no, no, sir, stop.

80
00:09:32,123 --> 00:09:35,612
You don't clear up after yourself.
That's my job.

81
00:09:35,691 --> 00:09:38,657
Sorry, Lunt. What's all this?

82
00:09:38,724 --> 00:09:44,021
From the gentleman last night, sir.
He just called. Left a note for you.

83
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:51,987
"I am very contrite.

84
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:55,546
"Please come to luncheon today.
Sebastian Flyte."

85
00:09:55,624 --> 00:09:58,591
The Lord Sebastian Flyte,
don't you know?

86
00:09:58,691 --> 00:10:02,146
I'm sure it's quite a pleasure
to clear up after him.

87
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,656
I take it
you'll be out to lunch today, then, sir.

88
00:10:05,725 --> 00:10:08,816
Yes, Lunt. I think I shall be.

89
00:10:51,293 --> 00:10:53,758
I've just counted them.

90
00:10:53,826 --> 00:10:57,384
There's five each and two over,
so I'm having the two.

91
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:01,589
I'm unaccountably hungry today.

92
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,749
I put myself unreservedly
in the hands of Dolbear and Goodall

93
00:11:04,827 --> 00:11:06,554
and feel so drugged
I've begun to believe

94
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,490
the whole of yesterday evening
was a dream.

95
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,558
Please don't wake me.

96
00:11:13,593 --> 00:11:16,116
- Do try one.
- Thank you.

97
00:11:17,528 --> 00:11:20,982
- What are they?
- Plover's eggs. The first this year.

98
00:11:22,461 --> 00:11:26,791
Mummy sends them from Brideshead.
They always lay early for her.

99
00:11:26,861 --> 00:11:29,554
You would, too, if you knew my mother.

100
00:11:32,195 --> 00:11:34,854
Are you terribly angry with me
about last night?

101
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:39,156
No, not at all.
Thank you for the flowers.

102
00:11:41,395 --> 00:11:45,191
Aloysius, you can't go there.
Do sit down.

103
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,887
- Tell me about you.
- Me?

104
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:59,386
I'm in my first year, reading history,

105
00:12:01,495 --> 00:12:04,859
but really what I most want to be
is a painter.

106
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:07,054
Would you like to paint me?

107
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:12,584
Well, yes. Yes, if you like.

108
00:12:12,663 --> 00:12:14,652
It's so clever of you,
knowing what you want.

109
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:17,025
I've no idea what I want.

110
00:12:17,096 --> 00:12:18,858
Except to be happy.

111
00:12:19,863 --> 00:12:21,351
If I can.

112
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,487
Let's have some champagne.

113
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:27,224
A glass each before the rowdies arrive.

114
00:12:31,897 --> 00:12:34,420
<i>You don't want to join the Old Boys.</i>

115
00:12:34,497 --> 00:12:38,361
They're all bloody drugged bogs
or collegers.

116
00:12:38,431 --> 00:12:40,090
Top me up,
will you, old man?

117
00:12:40,164 --> 00:12:43,324
- I don't remember you from Eton.
- I didn't go to Eton.

118
00:12:43,397 --> 00:12:47,727
Oh, really. Where then?
Harrow or Winchester?

119
00:12:48,864 --> 00:12:51,659
Rugby? Oh, not Charterhouse, I hope?

120
00:12:53,497 --> 00:12:55,487
You wouldn't have heard of it.

121
00:12:55,564 --> 00:12:57,463
There are other schools,
you know, Boy.

122
00:12:57,532 --> 00:12:59,997
Yes, I suppose there must be.

123
00:13:03,098 --> 00:13:04,826
- My dears.
- Hello, Blanche.

124
00:13:04,898 --> 00:13:06,091
Hello, Blanche.

125
00:13:06,165 --> 00:13:07,722
I couldn't get away before.

126
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:11,390
I was lunching
with my preposterous tutor.

127
00:13:11,465 --> 00:13:15,397
I told him I had to change for footer.

128
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,092
Anthony, you remember Charles.
From last night?

129
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,724
Charles is reading history,
but he wants to be an artist.

130
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:31,425
- No!
- Why ever not?

131
00:13:31,499 --> 00:13:34,863
- Either you are an artist or you are not.
- Hear, hear.

132
00:13:38,133 --> 00:13:40,690
- Then I am.
- Interesting.

133
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:45,095
You have about you
a distinct hint of the pragmatic.

134
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:48,860
What do you want to be an artist for?
I mean, what's the point of it?

135
00:13:48,933 --> 00:13:51,024
Why don't you just
buy a bloody camera

136
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,895
and take a bloody photograph
and stop giving yourself airs?

137
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:56,627
- That's what I want to know!
- That's it, go it, Boy!

138
00:13:56,701 --> 00:14:00,098
- I don't give myself airs.
- Yes, you do.

139
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:03,100
And, anyway,
you haven't answered my question.

140
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:04,895
Come on! Answer!

141
00:14:05,867 --> 00:14:09,265
- Answer, answer, answer, answer...
- Yes.

142
00:14:09,335 --> 00:14:11,664
Answer, answer, answer, answer...

143
00:14:11,734 --> 00:14:17,224
Because a camera
is a mechanical device

144
00:14:17,301 --> 00:14:20,096
which records a moment in time,

145
00:14:20,201 --> 00:14:25,224
but not what that moment means
or the emotions that it evokes.

146
00:14:26,401 --> 00:14:31,629
Whereas a painting,
however imperfect it may be,

147
00:14:32,969 --> 00:14:35,560
is an expression of feeling.

148
00:14:37,468 --> 00:14:39,367
An expression of love.

149
00:14:40,902 --> 00:14:43,095
Not just a copy of something.

150
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:50,925
And who on earth do you think
cares about your feelings?

151
00:14:51,035 --> 00:14:52,433
I do.

152
00:14:52,502 --> 00:14:55,060
Boy, you're an oaf. Behave yourself.

153
00:14:55,669 --> 00:14:58,135
To art and love.

154
00:15:00,869 --> 00:15:02,960
To art and love!

155
00:15:07,703 --> 00:15:12,432
We'd just arrived in his rooms, then,
without even a, "By your leave,"

156
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:16,367
the Lord Flyte pokes his head
through the window and vomits.

157
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:20,366
Ground floor rooms, you see.
Poor Charles may never recover.

158
00:15:20,437 --> 00:15:22,494
- Morning, Jasper.
- Morning.

159
00:15:32,237 --> 00:15:33,635
Two tries out of you today...

160
00:15:33,704 --> 00:15:36,864
Charles. You're to come away at once!

161
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:39,836
I've got a basket of strawberries
and a bottle of Chateau Peyraguey,

162
00:15:39,904 --> 00:15:42,427
which isn't a wine you've ever tasted,
so don't pretend.

163
00:15:42,504 --> 00:15:44,732
It's heaven with strawberries.

164
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,365
Just the place to bury a crock of gold.

165
00:16:11,872 --> 00:16:13,168
I should like to bury
something precious

166
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,864
in every place where I've been happy.

167
00:16:17,405 --> 00:16:20,565
And, then,
when I was old and ugly and miserable,

168
00:16:22,973 --> 00:16:28,304
I could come back
and dig it up and remember.

169
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,763
Come along, Charles.
There's someone I want you to meet.

170
00:17:13,975 --> 00:17:17,271
- Is this where you live?
- It's where my family live.

171
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:21,803
Don't worry,
you won't have to meet them.

172
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:25,830
- Oh, but I should like to.
- You can't. They're away.

173
00:17:49,743 --> 00:17:52,709
Everything's shut up.
We better go this way.

174
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:07,672
Keep up.

175
00:18:18,377 --> 00:18:21,105
Charles. Charles.

176
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:37,503
Well, this is a surprise!
How lovely to see you.

177
00:18:39,311 --> 00:18:41,504
Meet my new chum, Charles.

178
00:18:42,278 --> 00:18:45,802
Charles, this is Nanny Hawkins.
This is who I wanted you to meet.

179
00:18:45,878 --> 00:18:49,242
- I don't think I know you, do I?
- How do you do?

180
00:18:49,311 --> 00:18:53,437
Your friend has charming manners.
What family are you from, Charles?

181
00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:57,137
- No family. I mean, no one important.
- Charles is an artist.

182
00:18:58,312 --> 00:19:01,642
- He's going to paint me.
- How jolly.

183
00:19:03,112 --> 00:19:05,101
You've come at just the right time.

184
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:07,270
Lady Marchmain's
on her way up from London.

185
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,539
It's the Conservative Women's Tea.

186
00:19:09,646 --> 00:19:11,236
They always turn out for Brideshead.

187
00:19:11,312 --> 00:19:13,938
I'm afraid we may have
to miss them, Nanny.

188
00:19:14,013 --> 00:19:15,740
Your mother will be disappointed.

189
00:19:15,813 --> 00:19:17,540
I'm sure Her Ladyship
would want to meet...

190
00:19:17,612 --> 00:19:21,544
Can't be done, I'm afraid.
Got to get back or we'll be gated.

191
00:19:29,879 --> 00:19:32,573
I pray for my dear Sebastian every day.

192
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,104
- Charles!
- It was very nice to meet you.

193
00:19:44,847 --> 00:19:47,211
- Come along, Charles.
- Couldn't we just have a quick look?

194
00:19:47,281 --> 00:19:49,008
We've seen who we came for.
We can go.

195
00:19:49,081 --> 00:19:50,842
Just a little look.

196
00:20:28,649 --> 00:20:30,239
Don't be such a tourist, Charles.

197
00:20:30,315 --> 00:20:31,338
If you're that keen,

198
00:20:31,415 --> 00:20:35,109
you can see it all for a shilling
on Queen Alexandra's Day.

199
00:20:36,515 --> 00:20:38,674
God, I loathe that painting!

200
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:45,605
I could show you the chapel, I suppose,
if we're quick.

201
00:21:09,584 --> 00:21:11,573
What did you do that for?

202
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,610
- You're not Catholic, are you?
- No.

203
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:20,847
- I was just trying to fit in.
- Well, don't.

204
00:21:27,151 --> 00:21:28,616
Come on, come on!

205
00:21:28,684 --> 00:21:29,707
Sorry, I'm afraid I don't have the knack.

206
00:21:29,784 --> 00:21:31,909
Charles, what are you doing?

207
00:21:37,318 --> 00:21:38,579
Car. Now.

208
00:22:12,286 --> 00:22:14,218
Who was that in the car
with your mother?

209
00:22:14,286 --> 00:22:16,219
- My sister.
- What's she like?

210
00:22:16,287 --> 00:22:17,310
For goodness sake, Charles,

211
00:22:17,386 --> 00:22:20,148
I don't keep asking you questions
about your family.

212
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,277
But I've never
asked you anything before.

213
00:22:22,354 --> 00:22:24,183
You're so inquisitive.

214
00:22:24,253 --> 00:22:26,617
Well, you're so mysterious about them.

215
00:22:26,687 --> 00:22:29,517
I hoped I was mysterious
about everything.

216
00:22:30,587 --> 00:22:32,576
Why don't you want me
to meet your family?

217
00:22:32,654 --> 00:22:33,984
Who are you ashamed of, them or me?

218
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:36,212
Don't be so vulgar, Charles.

219
00:22:41,154 --> 00:22:45,518
I'm not having you mixed up
with my family. You're my friend.

220
00:22:47,388 --> 00:22:49,354
I don't have a family.

221
00:22:51,854 --> 00:22:53,286
You have me.

222
00:22:58,388 --> 00:23:01,912
<i>Sebastian and Charles,
contra mundum.</i>

223
00:23:05,922 --> 00:23:07,512
<i>Contra mundum.</i>

224
00:23:27,023 --> 00:23:28,283
Father?

225
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,316
Father?

226
00:23:35,357 --> 00:23:38,618
- Back already?
- Term's over.

227
00:23:38,689 --> 00:23:40,087
So soon?

228
00:23:59,657 --> 00:24:00,645
Thank you.

229
00:24:01,623 --> 00:24:03,987
- Father, I have to leave at once!
- Oh, yes?

230
00:24:04,057 --> 00:24:05,455
A great friend of mine
has had a terrible accident.

231
00:24:05,524 --> 00:24:07,648
- I must go to him.
- May I?

232
00:24:11,824 --> 00:24:15,917
"Gravely injured.
Come at once. Sebastian."

233
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:20,923
I'm sorry you're upset.

234
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,548
Reading this message,

235
00:24:22,624 --> 00:24:27,488
I would say that the accident was not
as serious as you seem to suggest

236
00:24:27,558 --> 00:24:31,491
or it would not have been signed
by the victim himself.

237
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:38,923
Still, of course, he may well be
fully conscious, but horribly paralyzed.

238
00:24:39,025 --> 00:24:42,355
Remind me.
Why is your presence necessary?

239
00:24:42,425 --> 00:24:45,220
I told you, he's a great friend.

240
00:24:45,292 --> 00:24:50,089
Well, I shall miss you, my boy,
but don't hurry back on my account.

241
00:25:08,693 --> 00:25:10,488
Take your bag, sir?

242
00:25:16,793 --> 00:25:18,191
Excuse me!

243
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,858
Are you Charles Ryder?

244
00:25:27,394 --> 00:25:29,792
Yes. Sorry. Hello.

245
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:33,315
I'm Julia, Sebastian's sister.
I've been sent to pick you up.

246
00:25:33,394 --> 00:25:35,087
Hop in, Mr. Ryder.

247
00:25:39,161 --> 00:25:42,150
- Case in the back.
- Sorry, yes.

248
00:26:11,628 --> 00:26:12,855
How's Sebastian?

249
00:26:12,929 --> 00:26:15,452
- He's fine.
- Fine?

250
00:26:15,529 --> 00:26:17,324
Did he tell you he was dying?

251
00:26:17,396 --> 00:26:19,692
Well, I thought... His message said...

252
00:26:19,763 --> 00:26:22,228
I expect he thought
you wouldn't come if you knew.

253
00:26:22,329 --> 00:26:23,818
He's not badly hurt, then?

254
00:26:23,896 --> 00:26:27,794
He cracked a bone in his foot
so small it hasn't even got a name.

255
00:26:27,863 --> 00:26:30,420
- How did it happen?
- Playing croquet.

256
00:26:34,896 --> 00:26:37,362
I must admit,
I did think it was a little queer,

257
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,793
you traveling all this way
for a croquet injury.

258
00:26:39,863 --> 00:26:42,523
I don't mind.
It's wonderful to be here again.

259
00:26:42,597 --> 00:26:44,586
Is it? Why?

260
00:26:44,664 --> 00:26:48,061
Well, it's such a beautiful house,
for one thing.

261
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:50,119
I can't stand the place.

262
00:26:55,497 --> 00:26:57,725
Be an angel and light me one.

263
00:27:36,132 --> 00:27:38,121
There you are, at last!

264
00:27:39,232 --> 00:27:43,221
- I thought you were dying.
- I thought I was, too.

265
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:45,322
The pain was excruciating.

266
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:49,822
Julia, ask Wilcox
to fetch us some champagne.

267
00:27:49,899 --> 00:27:52,387
- I hate champagne.
- For our guest.

268
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:57,026
Well, take your coat off. You'll boil.

269
00:28:02,734 --> 00:28:04,495
Come along, Charles.

270
00:28:19,301 --> 00:28:21,130
I thought you hated champagne.

271
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:22,292
I do.

272
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:26,591
I suppose Sebastian's told you
all about us?

273
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,599
No. No, nothing at all,
as a matter of fact.

274
00:28:28,668 --> 00:28:30,327
And nor should I.

275
00:28:31,735 --> 00:28:33,325
What?

276
00:28:33,401 --> 00:28:36,595
- I take it you're not one of us?
- Don't answer.

277
00:28:36,668 --> 00:28:38,327
I don't live like this,
if that's what you mean.

278
00:28:38,401 --> 00:28:41,367
She means you're not a Catholic.

279
00:28:41,434 --> 00:28:43,662
Sorry, no. No, nothing at all.

280
00:28:43,735 --> 00:28:47,293
- You mean you're an atheist?
- Well, yes, I suppose.

281
00:28:47,369 --> 00:28:48,994
Strictly speaking, we're C of E,

282
00:28:49,068 --> 00:28:53,330
but Father only ever goes
for Christmas and funerals.

283
00:28:54,302 --> 00:28:56,234
He likes those.

284
00:28:56,302 --> 00:28:59,234
- What about your mother?
- She's dead.

285
00:29:00,936 --> 00:29:02,561
I was very young.

286
00:29:02,635 --> 00:29:05,101
She died working for the Red Cross.

287
00:29:05,169 --> 00:29:06,725
Which, given her devotion to good,

288
00:29:06,802 --> 00:29:09,893
does rather point up
the arbitrariness of it all.

289
00:29:09,969 --> 00:29:13,526
I see. So, you're here arbitrarily?

290
00:29:13,602 --> 00:29:16,125
He's here as my friend.

291
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:20,363
Given Mr. Ryder's
staunch position on religion,

292
00:29:20,436 --> 00:29:22,901
don't you think he ought to know
what he's getting into?

293
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:24,765
Leave Charles out of it.

294
00:29:24,837 --> 00:29:27,030
- Tell me.
- Oh, God.

295
00:29:27,103 --> 00:29:30,127
Mummy takes her faith
very seriously, indeed.

296
00:29:30,203 --> 00:29:33,727
So seriously, in fact,
that our fat little priest, Father Mackay,

297
00:29:33,803 --> 00:29:35,826
called her a living saint.

298
00:29:36,536 --> 00:29:38,832
Mind you, he drinks.

299
00:29:38,903 --> 00:29:41,335
Sebastian and I
are a couple of heathens.

300
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:45,461
I'm not a heathen, I'm a sinner.
Cast out from God's love.

301
00:29:45,537 --> 00:29:48,867
As for you,
you're not a heathen at all, not really.

302
00:29:50,004 --> 00:29:52,937
Why do we always end up
talking about family?

303
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:56,134
It's time for my bath.

304
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:01,194
Good evening, Mr. Ryder.
Look after my brother.

305
00:30:11,472 --> 00:30:13,370
I don't think your sister
likes me very much.

306
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:16,131
I don't think
she cares for anyone much.

307
00:30:17,271 --> 00:30:18,635
I love her.

308
00:30:19,872 --> 00:30:21,428
She's like me.

309
00:30:22,605 --> 00:30:25,265
Drink in remembrance of me.

310
00:30:30,006 --> 00:30:30,994
Hang on.

311
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:04,104
In fact, I know that that's checkmate.

312
00:31:09,974 --> 00:31:11,337
Come here.

313
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,232
<i>If only it could be
like this always.</i>

314
00:31:18,574 --> 00:31:20,063
Always summer.

315
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,029
<i>Always alone.</i>

316
00:31:24,241 --> 00:31:25,900
Fruit always ripe.

317
00:31:36,174 --> 00:31:37,367
Cheers.

318
00:31:43,541 --> 00:31:44,734
Now,

319
00:31:47,209 --> 00:31:48,799
try this.

320
00:31:58,009 --> 00:32:01,373
- No?
- It's a shy little wine. Like a gazelle.

321
00:32:05,976 --> 00:32:09,067
- Like a leprechaun.
- Dappled in a tapestry meadow.

322
00:32:10,943 --> 00:32:12,966
A flute by still water.

323
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:19,072
This is a wise old wine.

324
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,807
A prophet in a cave.

325
00:32:27,877 --> 00:32:29,274
And this

326
00:32:31,276 --> 00:32:33,936
is a string of pearls on a white neck.

327
00:32:39,478 --> 00:32:42,773
- A swan.
- The last unicorn.

328
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:37,101
Who's that?

329
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,578
- Is that your brother?
- Yes, that's Bridey.

330
00:33:48,546 --> 00:33:51,706
- He seems all right to me.
- Wait till you meet him.

331
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,807
Mother.

332
00:34:11,981 --> 00:34:13,276
Hello, there.

333
00:34:13,347 --> 00:34:15,279
Go away,
we're not decent!

334
00:34:15,347 --> 00:34:18,109
- Mummy's here.
- We know.

335
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,578
She's invited Charles to dinner.

336
00:34:29,348 --> 00:34:31,610
It's not what we
agreed upon, Sebastian,

337
00:34:31,682 --> 00:34:34,546
when we talked about this
at Christmas, when you came down.

338
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:37,513
It's no use crying, darling.
That's just childish.

339
00:34:39,348 --> 00:34:42,371
That's not going to help, is it?

340
00:34:42,448 --> 00:34:45,040
You see, darling,
whatever yesterday's sins,

341
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:47,843
we must all pray for God's forgiveness.

342
00:34:49,416 --> 00:34:54,576
So now, you try and try again now.

343
00:34:54,649 --> 00:34:58,046
Be a good boy.
For God and for Mummy.

344
00:35:02,916 --> 00:35:06,110
Now, just put your shirt on now.

345
00:35:06,183 --> 00:35:08,081
Dining room's this way.

346
00:35:11,983 --> 00:35:15,575
Is Sebastian all right?
He seemed upset.

347
00:35:15,983 --> 00:35:16,971
Oh.

348
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:20,274
He and Mummy often have these talks.

349
00:35:21,817 --> 00:35:25,010
Flannels for dinner?
Very bold, Mr. Ryder.

350
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:28,277
- Will your mother mind?
- Yes, she'll be appalled.

351
00:35:29,384 --> 00:35:32,839
No, don't worry.
She'll be understanding.

352
00:35:32,917 --> 00:35:36,077
- Do you often do that?
- What?

353
00:35:36,151 --> 00:35:40,550
- Say one thing, mean another?
- Yes and no.

354
00:36:00,152 --> 00:36:01,583
Thank you.

355
00:36:10,885 --> 00:36:12,476
- Amen.
- Amen.

356
00:36:15,686 --> 00:36:19,550
Welcome to Brideshead, Mr. Ryder.
I've been hearing all about you.

357
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:23,847
I do hope you didn't let Sebastian
call you away in too much of a rush.

358
00:36:23,919 --> 00:36:26,544
I'm afraid I didn't quite have time
to pack the right things.

359
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:30,551
Sebastian must lend you some clothes
while you're here.

360
00:36:30,619 --> 00:36:32,778
Or perhaps Bridey's a better fit.

361
00:36:32,853 --> 00:36:35,149
Are you a Bridey
or a Sebastian, Mr. Ryder?

362
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:39,346
He can't borrow Bridey's clothes.
Bridey dresses like a bank clerk.

363
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:43,147
Don't be vulgar, Cordelia.
Vulgar is not the same as funny.

364
00:36:45,186 --> 00:36:48,209
I hope you've been
looked after properly, Ryder.

365
00:36:48,286 --> 00:36:50,878
Has Sebastian
been seeing to the wine?

366
00:36:51,787 --> 00:36:54,947
Yes. Sebastian's been
seeing to the wine.

367
00:36:55,021 --> 00:36:56,884
Delighted to hear it.

368
00:36:58,388 --> 00:37:01,479
- You're fond of wine?
- Yes, very.

369
00:37:01,554 --> 00:37:04,611
I wish I were.
It's such a bond with other men.

370
00:37:05,987 --> 00:37:09,613
At Christ Church, I tried to get drunk
more than once, but I didn't enjoy it.

371
00:37:09,688 --> 00:37:11,711
What do you enjoy, Bridey?

372
00:37:13,688 --> 00:37:16,745
Hunting, shooting,

373
00:37:19,155 --> 00:37:20,451
fishing.

374
00:37:23,355 --> 00:37:26,752
And what form do your pleasures take,
Mr. Ryder?

375
00:37:26,821 --> 00:37:29,083
- Sorry, pleasures?
- Your hobbies.

376
00:37:29,188 --> 00:37:31,177
- What do you do to relax?
- He drinks.

377
00:37:31,255 --> 00:37:34,312
Drinking is not a hobby, Sebastian.

378
00:37:34,389 --> 00:37:37,184
- You live in London, is that correct?
- Yes.

379
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,687
- Whereabouts?
- Paddington.

380
00:37:41,555 --> 00:37:43,646
You live in a railway station?

381
00:37:43,722 --> 00:37:48,950
No, no. Sorry. No, I live nearby.

382
00:37:49,023 --> 00:37:50,284
I see.

383
00:37:50,356 --> 00:37:53,345
And has this led
to an interest in trains?

384
00:37:55,623 --> 00:37:57,111
No.

385
00:37:57,189 --> 00:38:01,246
So, are you close
with Sebastian's crowd?

386
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,020
Not really.

387
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:09,818
- With Anthony Blanche?
- We're acquainted.

388
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:13,018
Charles is a painter, Mummy.

389
00:38:14,923 --> 00:38:16,684
How charming.

390
00:38:16,757 --> 00:38:18,280
We must get you
to paint something for us.

391
00:38:18,357 --> 00:38:21,619
- Would you do that, Mr. Ryder?
- I'd be delighted.

392
00:38:21,691 --> 00:38:25,487
I think Brideshead's the most
beautiful house I've ever seen.

393
00:38:28,624 --> 00:38:31,522
- It's utterly magical.
- How kind you are.

394
00:38:34,258 --> 00:38:36,053
Summer at Brideshead.

395
00:38:36,824 --> 00:38:39,949
Mr. Ryder must stay with us
for the rest of the vacation.

396
00:38:40,025 --> 00:38:43,082
As a matter of fact,
I've just heard from Papa.

397
00:38:44,158 --> 00:38:46,919
He wants me to go and see him
in Venice. And Julia.

398
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,582
I see.

399
00:38:48,658 --> 00:38:50,851
And do you intend
to accept this invitation?

400
00:38:50,925 --> 00:38:52,288
Yes. Why not?

401
00:38:52,358 --> 00:38:53,824
What about you, Julia?
Will you be going?

402
00:38:53,892 --> 00:38:55,187
I'd like to.

403
00:38:55,258 --> 00:38:57,884
Wouldn't you rather
stay at Brideshead?

404
00:39:03,825 --> 00:39:06,848
Well, yes, if you want me to.

405
00:39:09,693 --> 00:39:13,819
- You must not neglect your duty.
- No, Mother.

406
00:39:20,893 --> 00:39:24,848
I think we might spend a little time
in the chapel after dinner.

407
00:39:41,853 --> 00:39:46,170
- Would you join us, Mr. Ryder?
- Thank you.

408
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:48,720
You do know Charles is an atheist?

409
00:39:50,394 --> 00:39:52,251
An agnostic, surely.

410
00:39:54,282 --> 00:39:55,800
Actually, no.

411
00:39:57,107 --> 00:40:01,356
But you'll join us, anyway,
out of curiosity.

412
00:40:03,621 --> 00:40:04,980
Thank you.

413
00:40:09,935 --> 00:40:12,688
- No Sebastian?
- No, Mummy.

414
00:40:14,421 --> 00:40:16,902
Charles, are you really an atheist?

415
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:22,196
- Yes, I am.
- How awful for you.

416
00:40:22,265 --> 00:40:24,349
I'll put you on my prayer list.

417
00:40:24,425 --> 00:40:28,810
I have a long list of people I pray for,
including six black Cordelias in Africa.

418
00:40:28,878 --> 00:40:31,030
It's a new thing. You send five bob
to some nuns in Africa,

419
00:40:31,104 --> 00:40:34,061
and they christen a baby after you.

420
00:40:34,129 --> 00:40:35,114
Right.

421
00:40:35,957 --> 00:40:39,877
Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

422
00:40:39,945 --> 00:40:42,834
Give us this day our daily bread,

423
00:40:42,903 --> 00:40:44,954
and forgive us our trespasses

424
00:40:45,029 --> 00:40:48,417
as we forgive
those who trespass against us.

425
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:53,731
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

426
00:40:53,803 --> 00:40:54,924
Amen.

427
00:41:36,475 --> 00:41:39,024
Have you ever
been to Venice, Mr. Ryder?

428
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,083
No. No, I haven't.

429
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,673
Every ambitious young man
should visit Venice.

430
00:41:44,749 --> 00:41:47,333
It makes one sound more complete.

431
00:41:49,435 --> 00:41:54,376
I was thinking, if Sebastian were to go,

432
00:41:54,453 --> 00:41:57,897
it might be a good thing
if you were to accompany him.

433
00:41:59,139 --> 00:42:01,757
He needs someone plausible
by his side.

434
00:42:02,828 --> 00:42:08,368
I gather last time he was there, he was
befriending some very odd types.

435
00:42:08,444 --> 00:42:11,163
It's youthful high spirits, I understand,

436
00:42:12,034 --> 00:42:16,849
but in the end,
we must all accept God's limits.

437
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,436
Atheist, or no.

438
00:42:26,024 --> 00:42:28,041
I know I can rely on you.

439
00:42:29,049 --> 00:42:31,768
You seem to me
a very reliable young man.

440
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:11,852
- San Giovanni e Paolo.
- Oh, dear.

441
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,036
I can see
you're going to be impossibly curious.

442
00:43:15,143 --> 00:43:19,223
By the way, I should warn you.
Our lovely father is rather a scoundrel.

443
00:43:19,297 --> 00:43:21,983
He lives
in one of the palazzos with Cara.

444
00:43:22,056 --> 00:43:24,107
- Who's Cara?
- His mistress.

445
00:43:25,346 --> 00:43:28,065
Poor Papa's rather shunned by society.

446
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:30,619
Not the Italians, of course.
They adore him.

447
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:39,003
- Santa Maria dei Miracoli.
- I know. I've seen the postcard.

448
00:44:07,021 --> 00:44:09,706
- My dear boy!
- Darling, Papa.

449
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:13,700
- You look so young!
- Do you think so?

450
00:44:13,767 --> 00:44:16,814
I've taken to playing tennis
at the Lido with a professional.

451
00:44:16,891 --> 00:44:19,010
Cara thinks I'm getting far too fat.

452
00:44:19,084 --> 00:44:20,307
Julia, come here.

453
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:23,099
- Father.
- My child.

454
00:44:23,172 --> 00:44:25,427
- I wasn't sure if you'd come.
- Mummy gave me her blessing.

455
00:44:25,499 --> 00:44:28,048
Blessed by your mother.
What a saint that woman is.

456
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:30,741
You know, I used to try everything
to please her.

457
00:44:30,815 --> 00:44:32,571
Julia, this is your friend, Mr. Ryder?

458
00:44:32,643 --> 00:44:35,430
- Charles is my friend, Papa.
- I see.

459
00:44:35,501 --> 00:44:38,187
- Delighted.
- How do you do, sir?

460
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:42,044
- Welcome to Venice.
- Here's Cara. Now we can eat.

461
00:44:42,115 --> 00:44:44,075
Come along now. This way.

462
00:44:57,701 --> 00:45:00,557
Don't look so greedy. It won't go away.

463
00:45:01,689 --> 00:45:02,912
Sorry.

464
00:45:07,837 --> 00:45:10,352
I wasn't sure you'd come to Venice.

465
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:13,450
Your father seemed
pleased to see you.

466
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,306
I'm not sure Father
cares much if I come.

467
00:45:16,378 --> 00:45:19,358
He'd probably be just as happy
if it was only Sebastian.

468
00:45:19,436 --> 00:45:23,221
They adore each other.
They're alike in so many ways.

469
00:45:25,218 --> 00:45:27,075
- Who are you like?
- Me?

470
00:45:27,678 --> 00:45:28,663
Oh.

471
00:45:29,638 --> 00:45:30,895
Nobody.

472
00:45:31,831 --> 00:45:33,723
I'm the family shadow.

473
00:45:39,774 --> 00:45:41,031
Drinks.

474
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:47,282
- Julia.
- Cara.

475
00:45:49,612 --> 00:45:53,396
Mr. Ryder, Sebastian tells me
you are a painter.

476
00:45:53,466 --> 00:45:56,016
- Charles is an artist.
- Good.

477
00:45:56,092 --> 00:46:00,341
Well, then I will show you all the
great art of Canaletto and Veronese.

478
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:04,063
He never goes anywhere.
Such a philistine.

479
00:46:04,134 --> 00:46:07,816
I don't mind the art.
It's religion I can't stand.

480
00:46:07,889 --> 00:46:10,937
The Italians seem unable
to paint anything half decent

481
00:46:11,014 --> 00:46:13,800
without putting Christ dying in it.

482
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:15,593
Of course, your mother loved Italy.

483
00:46:15,699 --> 00:46:18,520
- A pietà on every street corner.
- Don't be cruel.

484
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:22,409
On the contrary, she'd be flattered.
God was always her first love.

485
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:24,869
- Mummy loves all of us equally.
- Come now, Julia.

486
00:46:24,938 --> 00:46:27,396
You were the one who walked away!

487
00:46:33,479 --> 00:46:36,731
What must you think of us, Mr. Ryder?

488
00:46:36,802 --> 00:46:39,952
- A family of monsters, are we not?
- No, not at all.

489
00:46:41,488 --> 00:46:43,912
I lost my mother when I was young.

490
00:46:49,165 --> 00:46:54,672
Tell me, Mr. Ryder, as an artist,
what did you make of Brideshead?

491
00:46:55,845 --> 00:46:57,600
I thought it was magnificent.

492
00:46:57,673 --> 00:47:00,925
You think that? Really?

493
00:47:00,996 --> 00:47:03,319
And now, here you are in Venice.

494
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:06,271
What a lot of temptations.

495
00:47:22,897 --> 00:47:27,282
He walks for two hours
every day. He wants to be immortal.

496
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:30,794
But he's quite fragile, you know, inside.

497
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:35,290
That woman nearly suffocated him.

498
00:47:36,888 --> 00:47:42,304
- She's been very kind to me.
- Oh, yes. I'm sure. But you will see.

499
00:47:43,635 --> 00:47:45,527
Well, just look at her children.

500
00:47:45,595 --> 00:47:48,246
Even when they were tiny,
in the nursery,

501
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,110
they must do
what she want them to do,

502
00:47:50,181 --> 00:47:52,164
be what she want them to be.

503
00:47:52,242 --> 00:47:54,497
Only then, would she love them.

504
00:47:56,096 --> 00:48:01,479
It's not Lady Marchmain's fault.
Her God has done that to her.

505
00:48:01,547 --> 00:48:04,164
But surely you're Catholic, too?

506
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:07,128
Yes, but a different sort.

507
00:48:07,197 --> 00:48:11,673
It's different in Italy. Not so much guilt.

508
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:16,395
We do what the heart tell us,
and then we go to confession.

509
00:48:24,843 --> 00:48:27,528
Sebastian loves you very much, I think.

510
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:30,415
There you are.

511
00:48:30,493 --> 00:48:34,969
They're very good,
these romantic English friendships,

512
00:48:35,046 --> 00:48:37,799
if they don't go on too long.

513
00:48:40,098 --> 00:48:44,075
For you, it's just a,
how do you say, "a phase"?

514
00:48:46,245 --> 00:48:49,497
But I think it's more than that
for poor Sebastian.

515
00:48:55,518 --> 00:48:57,636
Tread carefully, Mr. Ryder.

516
00:49:01,865 --> 00:49:03,122
Come on.

517
00:49:04,556 --> 00:49:07,140
- Hello.
- No! No!

518
00:49:13,064 --> 00:49:14,321
Come on.

519
00:49:15,756 --> 00:49:17,013
Got you.

520
00:50:09,694 --> 00:50:12,447
- Can't sleep.
- Try pajamas.

521
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:22,621
I enjoyed the beach today.
I hope I wasn't too rough.

522
00:50:22,721 --> 00:50:24,511
You were very sweet.

523
00:50:30,365 --> 00:50:31,657
Charles?

524
00:50:33,888 --> 00:50:35,542
There you are.

525
00:50:44,954 --> 00:50:46,211
Sorry.

526
00:50:48,544 --> 00:50:50,062
Lots to drink.

527
00:50:54,061 --> 00:50:56,383
I'm so glad you're here.

528
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:59,308
- I'm glad you're here.
- I'm glad I came.

529
00:50:59,377 --> 00:51:03,196
- Did I say I'm glad you're here?
- You're really glad I'm here?

530
00:51:15,928 --> 00:51:18,647
Let's get plastered.
- If you want.

531
00:51:18,752 --> 00:51:22,401
Oh, yes, I do. I want. I want.

532
00:51:30,916 --> 00:51:33,034
There's a wonderful chapel
near here!

533
00:51:33,109 --> 00:51:36,190
You will see a masterpiece, I tell you.

534
00:51:55,674 --> 00:51:58,031
The devil's got his eye on you!

535
00:52:01,357 --> 00:52:03,714
Well, then you must protect me.

536
00:52:26,282 --> 00:52:27,437
Julia!

537
00:53:16,065 --> 00:53:17,425
Julia.

538
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:20,576
I got lost. All those people.

539
00:53:53,154 --> 00:53:54,944
What are you doing?

540
00:53:57,242 --> 00:53:58,896
What's the matter?

541
00:54:01,728 --> 00:54:02,713
No!

542
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:20,319
Funny old religion, isn't it?

543
00:55:24,246 --> 00:55:25,640
Sebastian,

544
00:55:28,998 --> 00:55:32,646
what happened just now...
I never meant you to...

545
00:55:36,409 --> 00:55:38,890
If I'd known it was going to happen,

546
00:55:41,494 --> 00:55:43,148
I'd never have...

547
00:55:46,213 --> 00:55:48,797
I don't know what I'm supposed to...

548
00:56:48,492 --> 00:56:50,848
Checkmate.

549
00:56:54,075 --> 00:56:58,925
I'm boring you.
Perhaps it is dull for you here.

550
00:57:00,323 --> 00:57:02,442
You've been enjoying yourself?

551
00:57:02,516 --> 00:57:05,802
- I've been in Venice.
- Oh, yes, yes, I suppose so.

552
00:57:07,568 --> 00:57:12,010
The friend you were
so much concerned about, did he die?

553
00:57:15,211 --> 00:57:17,897
- No.
- I'm very thankful.

554
00:57:17,969 --> 00:57:21,946
You should have written to tell me.
I worried about him so much.

555
00:57:37,478 --> 00:57:39,699
Watch out, Flyte!
- Sebastian!

556
00:57:42,695 --> 00:57:45,119
- Sebastian!
- Leave me alone!

557
00:57:48,876 --> 00:57:52,162
- Damn. Where is he? The bastard.
- Who?

558
00:57:52,267 --> 00:57:54,419
- Mr. Samgrass.
- Who's Mr. Samgrass?

559
00:57:54,493 --> 00:57:57,643
One of Mummy's gang.
Fat little Catholic from All Souls.

560
00:57:57,717 --> 00:57:59,337
Bastard's been set up to follow me.

561
00:57:59,412 --> 00:58:01,667
I wouldn't mind
if he wasn't so infernally ugly.

562
00:58:01,737 --> 00:58:05,182
God, I feel a hundred years old.

563
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:07,844
Why haven't you called round?
I've been worried.

564
00:58:07,919 --> 00:58:11,341
I was beginning to think
they hadn't sent you up.

565
00:58:11,409 --> 00:58:13,867
- Since Venice.
- Yes.

566
00:58:18,654 --> 00:58:20,875
- Damn! There he is again.
- Who? What are you talking about?

567
00:58:20,946 --> 00:58:23,371
- Mr. Samgrass! There!
- Do you mind?

568
00:58:23,439 --> 00:58:25,762
Mummy's hired him to watch me.

569
00:58:25,832 --> 00:58:28,188
- What does he want?
- My head on a plate.

570
00:58:28,258 --> 00:58:32,439
Look, if he's bothering you,
I can stop him.

571
00:58:34,838 --> 00:58:38,486
Dear Charles, always so certain.

572
00:58:39,657 --> 00:58:43,101
- I'm not certain of anything.
- Aren't you?

573
00:58:47,999 --> 00:58:51,013
By the way, Mummy's here.

574
00:58:52,718 --> 00:58:54,678
She has to talk to you.

575
00:58:56,306 --> 00:58:58,561
Probably wants you
to spy on me as well.

576
00:58:58,633 --> 00:59:00,389
Don't be like that.

577
00:59:01,957 --> 00:59:05,344
Why don't I come round
to your rooms later?

578
00:59:05,413 --> 00:59:08,132
I'm not sure I want to see you anymore.

579
00:59:21,763 --> 00:59:23,224
I'm so sorry.

580
00:59:42,334 --> 00:59:44,192
So, Charles,

581
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,635
- how was Venice?
- Venice was fine.

582
00:59:51,075 --> 00:59:54,860
- A strange way to put it.
- It was beautiful.

583
00:59:54,930 --> 00:59:57,252
Speaking as an artist or a man?

584
00:59:59,748 --> 01:00:02,706
I want a word with you
about Sebastian.

585
01:00:02,773 --> 01:00:04,733
I'm concerned about him.

586
01:00:06,528 --> 01:00:07,989
- Tea?
- No, thank you.

587
01:00:09,021 --> 01:00:10,914
- Why? Should I be?
- He's drinking too much.

588
01:00:10,981 --> 01:00:14,868
You must have noticed.
After all, I sent you to look after him.

589
01:00:15,901 --> 01:00:17,690
Yes, I suppose
we both drink too much, really.

590
01:00:17,761 --> 01:00:19,483
No, not at all. You drink to get drunk,

591
01:00:19,556 --> 01:00:23,103
Sebastian drinks to escape
the claims of his conscience.

592
01:00:26,867 --> 01:00:29,587
I do wish I could understand
why he's so particularly upset.

593
01:00:29,658 --> 01:00:33,340
Ever since he came back from Venice,
he's been unreachable.

594
01:00:34,145 --> 01:00:37,658
- Did something happen there?
- No.

595
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:43,083
- You all had a good time?
- Yes.

596
01:00:44,314 --> 01:00:46,705
I wonder what it could have been.

597
01:00:49,532 --> 01:00:52,251
I hope you didn't let Julia mislead you.

598
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:56,207
- I don't understand.
- I think you do.

599
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:58,760
Please understand,

600
01:00:58,837 --> 01:01:02,690
I would not want you
to make yourself look foolish, Charles.

601
01:01:03,556 --> 01:01:08,406
Her future is not a question of choice.
It is a matter of faith.

602
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:13,414
Were it simply
a difference in upbringing,

603
01:01:13,493 --> 01:01:15,215
this I might overlook.

604
01:01:15,288 --> 01:01:17,611
But you are a self-proclaimed atheist,

605
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:21,431
and my daughter
is destined to marry a Catholic.

606
01:01:21,502 --> 01:01:23,620
God commands and we obey.

607
01:01:26,121 --> 01:01:27,344
However, we're forgetting ourselves.

608
01:01:27,418 --> 01:01:30,070
We're here to talk
about your friendship with my son.

609
01:01:30,143 --> 01:01:33,225
I'm not sure Sebastian
wants to be my friend anymore.

610
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:34,920
Because of Julia?

611
01:01:35,959 --> 01:01:38,474
But that is all cleared up now.

612
01:01:38,550 --> 01:01:40,273
We're giving a ball for Julia's 21 st.

613
01:01:40,345 --> 01:01:42,963
I'd like you
to keep Sebastian company.

614
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:46,118
You came to Brideshead
as my son's friend.

615
01:01:46,195 --> 01:01:49,447
If you have
unaccountably offended him,

616
01:01:49,517 --> 01:01:53,336
it is surely not too much to ask
that you revisit your responsibilities.

617
01:01:55,101 --> 01:01:58,614
- To him or to you?
- To the family.

618
01:02:01,615 --> 01:02:03,507
And, of course,

619
01:02:03,576 --> 01:02:07,587
Brideshead does look particularly
beautiful at this time of year.

620
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:11,940
Tell me, I'm curious.

621
01:02:13,612 --> 01:02:16,433
Since, as you claim,
you have no religion,

622
01:02:18,099 --> 01:02:21,180
what do you imagine
you are doing on this earth?

623
01:02:23,149 --> 01:02:25,540
Living my life, the same as you.

624
01:02:25,609 --> 01:02:29,122
But without faith,
what could your purpose possibly be?

625
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:35,538
I want to look back and say that I was

626
01:02:36,244 --> 01:02:37,229
alive.

627
01:02:39,202 --> 01:02:42,884
That I didn't turn my back. That I tried.

628
01:02:45,083 --> 01:02:46,839
That I was happy.

629
01:02:46,945 --> 01:02:49,834
Happiness in this life is irrelevant.

630
01:02:49,903 --> 01:02:52,055
All that matters,

631
01:02:52,129 --> 01:02:57,307
the only thing of consequence,
is the life hereafter.

632
01:03:08,347 --> 01:03:10,364
Ready for the off.

633
01:03:11,504 --> 01:03:14,122
A beautiful day for it, isn't it? Come on.

634
01:03:42,245 --> 01:03:46,630
Funny, isn't it?
It's my little present to the family.

635
01:03:46,698 --> 01:03:49,848
- Rex Mottram. How do you do?
- Charles Ryder.

636
01:03:50,586 --> 01:03:53,634
Good to meet you, Charles.
Heard all about you.

637
01:03:54,275 --> 01:03:57,459
We should compare notes some time.

638
01:03:57,532 --> 01:03:59,718
- Going on the hunt?
- I don't think so.

639
01:03:59,792 --> 01:04:03,236
Wise man. Load of English
blue bloods on horseback.

640
01:04:04,146 --> 01:04:06,072
Got to fit in, though!

641
01:04:19,233 --> 01:04:20,626
Who is it?

642
01:04:24,983 --> 01:04:26,309
It's me.

643
01:04:27,309 --> 01:04:30,095
You could have knocked.
I nearly spilt my drink.

644
01:04:30,167 --> 01:04:31,356
I did.

645
01:04:34,786 --> 01:04:36,112
Sit down.

646
01:05:07,023 --> 01:05:09,607
If only it could be like this always.

647
01:05:10,412 --> 01:05:13,064
- Always summer.
- Ancient history.

648
01:05:14,699 --> 01:05:16,421
Pass me a towel.

649
01:05:32,346 --> 01:05:34,669
Where's that damn shirt?

650
01:05:36,566 --> 01:05:39,717
You're shaking. What is it?
What's the matter?

651
01:05:41,685 --> 01:05:43,645
Don't you know, Charles?

652
01:05:44,942 --> 01:05:47,661
"Why this is hell, nor am I out of it."

653
01:05:48,231 --> 01:05:51,347
- Sebastian, if I've ever done anything...
- It's not you.

654
01:05:52,518 --> 01:05:53,878
It's me.

655
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:03,384
For God's sake, do stop mooning at me
like a great big cow!

656
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:06,705
I'm fine.

657
01:06:08,636 --> 01:06:11,718
I'm fine so long
as I've got plenty of this.

658
01:06:11,794 --> 01:06:15,113
I want you to know that
whatever happened in Venice,

659
01:06:15,615 --> 01:06:19,230
I'm not in your mother's gang,
if that's what you think.

660
01:06:20,933 --> 01:06:22,723
I'm on your side.

661
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:25,175
<i>Contra mundum.</i>

662
01:06:29,707 --> 01:06:31,429
Dear Charles,

663
01:06:35,689 --> 01:06:38,045
you're not in anybody's gang.

664
01:06:39,178 --> 01:06:41,659
That's always been your problem.

665
01:06:51,474 --> 01:06:55,293
Why are you going on the hunt?
I thought you detested hunting.

666
01:06:56,161 --> 01:06:57,350
I do.

667
01:06:59,550 --> 01:07:02,802
I'm going to leave Bridey
at the first covert,

668
01:07:02,874 --> 01:07:06,692
hack over to the nearest pub,
and spend the whole day drinking.

669
01:07:09,254 --> 01:07:10,546
If they treat me like a dipsomaniac,

670
01:07:10,616 --> 01:07:13,336
they can bloody well
have a dipsomaniac.

671
01:07:13,707 --> 01:07:15,395
Well, they can't stop you.

672
01:07:15,469 --> 01:07:17,690
They can, as a matter of fact,

673
01:07:20,852 --> 01:07:24,796
by not giving me any money.
They've stopped my bank account.

674
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:29,853
I've pawned my watch
and cigarette case.

675
01:07:31,321 --> 01:07:33,372
That lasted for a bit,

676
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:37,193
but that's all gone now.

677
01:07:38,666 --> 01:07:40,818
So, regretfully...

678
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:43,945
Sebastian, I can't do that.

679
01:07:45,046 --> 01:07:48,094
- I thought you were on my side.
- I am.

680
01:07:48,170 --> 01:07:49,631
Well, then.

681
01:07:50,264 --> 01:07:52,621
Look, why don't I come with you?

682
01:07:53,454 --> 01:07:55,777
It's miserable drinking alone.

683
01:07:56,346 --> 01:07:58,203
We could get drunk together,
like we used to.

684
01:07:58,273 --> 01:07:59,258
No.

685
01:08:01,131 --> 01:08:02,920
I'm past all that.

686
01:08:04,155 --> 01:08:06,116
Thanks for the offer.

687
01:08:09,606 --> 01:08:10,761
Well?

688
01:08:12,363 --> 01:08:14,618
Are you with me or against me?

689
01:08:41,542 --> 01:08:44,364
Little bit further up
on the shoulder, though.

690
01:08:44,434 --> 01:08:45,895
Sarah, look.

691
01:08:46,992 --> 01:08:48,681
Sort of up here.

692
01:09:42,525 --> 01:09:46,774
Ladies and gentlemen,
it gives me great pleasure to announce,

693
01:09:46,846 --> 01:09:49,769
on top of the birthday festivities,

694
01:09:49,837 --> 01:09:53,950
the engagement of my eldest daughter,
the Lady Julia Flyte

695
01:09:54,024 --> 01:09:55,814
to Mr. Rex Mottram.

696
01:10:09,578 --> 01:10:11,900
Yes, it's marvelous, isn't it.

697
01:10:18,052 --> 01:10:21,474
- Thank you, Charles. I'd love to dance.
- Cordelia.

698
01:10:21,541 --> 01:10:24,125
- Cordelia, I'm...
- Come along!

699
01:10:34,336 --> 01:10:35,888
- Charles?
- Hmm?

700
01:10:36,696 --> 01:10:40,740
I hope you don't mind me asking,
but modern art,

701
01:10:41,382 --> 01:10:44,860
- it is all bosh, isn't it?
- Yes, it's all bosh.

702
01:10:44,937 --> 01:10:46,864
Good. I thought so.

703
01:10:50,188 --> 01:10:52,273
Get a grip, Charles!

704
01:10:53,511 --> 01:10:56,468
Rex! Rex, I need a better dancer.

705
01:10:57,466 --> 01:11:00,084
Yours for five minutes and no more.

706
01:11:00,158 --> 01:11:02,175
- Come along.
- Okay.

707
01:11:04,445 --> 01:11:06,768
You're rather tall, aren't you?

708
01:11:06,838 --> 01:11:08,560
Is that a handicap?

709
01:11:28,838 --> 01:11:30,821
Why didn't you tell me?

710
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:35,212
It's not Sebastian. I don't believe that.

711
01:11:35,285 --> 01:11:37,268
Charles, I can't do this.

712
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:40,137
- When we kissed...
- Please, stop!

713
01:11:42,032 --> 01:11:44,355
Why? It was wonderful.

714
01:11:46,086 --> 01:11:47,378
I know.

715
01:11:51,403 --> 01:11:53,692
I think about it all the time.

716
01:11:56,189 --> 01:11:57,979
I have no choice.

717
01:12:14,833 --> 01:12:17,790
- Oh, Sebastian.
- Never mind.

718
01:12:22,743 --> 01:12:24,669
- Oh, Charles.
- Don't!

719
01:12:29,389 --> 01:12:31,349
- Come along, old boy.
- I don't want your help.

720
01:12:31,417 --> 01:12:33,535
You're in tweed, Sebastian.
This is a ball.

721
01:12:33,610 --> 01:12:36,533
Bugger off, Bridey.
You're worse than wet.

722
01:12:40,057 --> 01:12:42,946
You see... What it is...

723
01:12:43,015 --> 01:12:45,304
I hate you all so very much!

724
01:12:46,072 --> 01:12:48,190
- Sebastian.
- Get off me!

725
01:12:48,664 --> 01:12:49,684
You don't care about me!

726
01:12:49,761 --> 01:12:51,551
All you ever wanted
was to sleep with my sister!

727
01:12:51,623 --> 01:12:53,911
Okay, Sebastian, that's enough.

728
01:12:54,878 --> 01:12:56,702
All right. I'm going.

729
01:13:39,212 --> 01:13:40,606
Charles,

730
01:13:43,566 --> 01:13:46,047
did you give Sebastian money today?

731
01:13:48,285 --> 01:13:49,746
Yes, I did.

732
01:13:51,973 --> 01:13:54,658
Knowing how he was likely to spend it?

733
01:13:56,527 --> 01:13:57,716
Yes.

734
01:13:59,384 --> 01:14:01,140
I don't understand.

735
01:14:01,843 --> 01:14:04,767
How could you be so nice
in so many ways,

736
01:14:05,998 --> 01:14:08,751
and then do something
so wantonly cruel?

737
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:13,631
We all liked you so much.
I don't understand how we deserved it.

738
01:14:16,234 --> 01:14:21,083
Do you think it's better
to make him feel like a criminal?

739
01:14:22,814 --> 01:14:25,205
Having him watched
every second of the day?

740
01:14:25,273 --> 01:14:28,129
But you deliberately
helped him to drink.

741
01:14:30,723 --> 01:14:33,080
You're the reason he drinks,

742
01:14:34,545 --> 01:14:35,837
not me.

743
01:14:37,138 --> 01:14:38,758
All I did was

744
01:14:40,328 --> 01:14:42,084
try to give him a little freedom.

745
01:14:42,156 --> 01:14:46,303
No, you just wanted him to like you.
You're so desperate to be liked.

746
01:14:46,377 --> 01:14:48,994
I think you should leave now, Charles.

747
01:16:11,818 --> 01:16:14,742
Hello, there.
Would you like me to hold the ladder?

748
01:16:14,809 --> 01:16:16,293
Yes, thanks.

749
01:16:20,925 --> 01:16:23,712
I'm Celia Mulcaster, by the way.

750
01:16:26,275 --> 01:16:27,827
Charles Ryder.

751
01:16:29,067 --> 01:16:33,543
I saw your paintings in the brochure
and thought how charming they looked.

752
01:16:36,477 --> 01:16:38,528
No need to look so gloomy.

753
01:16:39,269 --> 01:16:42,249
If I had half your talent, I'd be delirious.

754
01:16:44,420 --> 01:16:46,743
You can thank me, if you want.

755
01:16:48,741 --> 01:16:50,101
Thank you.

756
01:16:52,995 --> 01:16:55,646
Would you like me
to buy something now?

757
01:17:14,198 --> 01:17:17,517
Silent and grave,
and then "pop," mouse is dead.

758
01:17:19,248 --> 01:17:21,470
- Charles.
- Lady Marchmain.

759
01:17:23,669 --> 01:17:25,323
Thank you, Father.

760
01:17:27,391 --> 01:17:30,472
I'm so glad your son
didn't die of his injuries.

761
01:17:35,053 --> 01:17:37,780
Please, sit down.

762
01:17:38,354 --> 01:17:40,149
I'm fine, thank you.

763
01:17:42,753 --> 01:17:44,343
How did you know where I lived?

764
01:17:44,419 --> 01:17:46,317
My driver found you.

765
01:17:46,386 --> 01:17:49,045
The Ryders of Paddington
are limited in number.

766
01:17:49,119 --> 01:17:51,983
I hear you have your first exhibition
at the Royal Academy.

767
01:17:52,052 --> 01:17:53,678
Congratulations.

768
01:17:54,152 --> 01:17:56,311
I'm sure you're not here
to ask me how I am.

769
01:17:56,386 --> 01:18:00,750
No. The last time we saw each other,
it's true I spoke rather harshly.

770
01:18:01,485 --> 01:18:04,679
I'm not here to apologize.
What I said, I meant.

771
01:18:05,485 --> 01:18:08,679
I took you into my confidence,
and you betrayed me.

772
01:18:09,485 --> 01:18:12,246
I do hope you're not asking me
to agree with you.

773
01:18:12,318 --> 01:18:14,977
- I act only as God directs.
- Rubbish.

774
01:18:15,518 --> 01:18:18,779
God's your best invention.
Whatever you want, he does.

775
01:18:18,851 --> 01:18:23,442
- I am not here to argue with you.
- Good. I'm glad to hear it.

776
01:18:23,517 --> 01:18:26,506
The reason I called
was to ask you a favor.

777
01:18:29,818 --> 01:18:31,147
A favor?

778
01:18:32,950 --> 01:18:36,780
Sebastian's gone missing.
He's in a house in Morocco.

779
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:40,248
I'm worried about him.
I need you to bring him back.

780
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:43,943
You banish me from your house,

781
01:18:44,017 --> 01:18:47,346
you poison my friendship
with both your children

782
01:18:47,416 --> 01:18:50,348
and now you expect me
to go begging on your behalf?

783
01:18:50,416 --> 01:18:52,644
There's no one else I can ask.

784
01:18:52,983 --> 01:18:54,141
Even if I were to agree,

785
01:18:54,216 --> 01:18:57,444
what makes you think Sebastian
would take any notice of me?

786
01:18:57,516 --> 01:19:02,846
Because he cared for you more
than he ever cared for anyone else.

787
01:19:08,349 --> 01:19:11,145
All I ever wanted was to see them safe.

788
01:19:12,116 --> 01:19:14,308
And all they do is hate me.

789
01:19:30,948 --> 01:19:32,880
I'll be at Brideshead.

790
01:19:34,181 --> 01:19:36,443
You may send word to me there.

791
01:19:36,981 --> 01:19:38,276
Driver!

792
01:19:41,448 --> 01:19:42,709
Driver!

793
01:21:35,975 --> 01:21:38,305
I'm looking for Sebastian Flyte.

794
01:21:42,809 --> 01:21:44,968
This is his house.

795
01:21:45,909 --> 01:21:48,534
- Who are you?
- I'm his friend.

796
01:21:50,709 --> 01:21:52,641
In the local hospital.

797
01:21:54,442 --> 01:21:56,237
When you see him,

798
01:21:57,241 --> 01:21:59,434
tell him I'm still here.

799
01:22:05,774 --> 01:22:08,172
Your friend
has got the grippe.

800
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:12,672
One of his lungs is full of fluid.

801
01:22:13,107 --> 01:22:16,733
He will recover. But travel with you?
Not a chance.

802
01:22:17,441 --> 01:22:19,872
He's very weak. No resistance.

803
01:22:21,074 --> 01:22:23,904
What do you expect?
He is an alcoholic.

804
01:22:54,806 --> 01:22:56,567
Here is your friend.

805
01:23:13,272 --> 01:23:15,737
What the hell are you doing here?

806
01:23:16,171 --> 01:23:18,137
Your mother asked me to come.

807
01:23:18,204 --> 01:23:20,830
She wants me to bring you back home,

808
01:23:21,604 --> 01:23:25,536
but the doctor said
it's out of the question for you to travel.

809
01:23:25,837 --> 01:23:27,962
I wouldn't, even if I could.

810
01:23:28,737 --> 01:23:30,169
I think...

811
01:23:32,637 --> 01:23:34,535
I think she's dying.

812
01:23:43,236 --> 01:23:46,259
Walk with me. I'm meant to exercise.

813
01:24:05,968 --> 01:24:07,957
Did you go to my house?

814
01:24:09,269 --> 01:24:11,064
Did you meet Kurt?

815
01:24:12,202 --> 01:24:13,463
Yes.

816
01:24:15,469 --> 01:24:18,400
He wanted you to know
he was waiting for you.

817
01:24:19,468 --> 01:24:21,832
It's rather a pleasant change,

818
01:24:22,902 --> 01:24:26,493
when all your life
you've had people looking after you,

819
01:24:27,034 --> 01:24:29,728
to have someone to look after, yourself.

820
01:24:44,233 --> 01:24:46,290
I thought you'd want to go back
to Brideshead one day.

821
01:24:46,367 --> 01:24:47,833
Brideshead?

822
01:24:48,434 --> 01:24:49,900
Are you mad?

823
01:24:51,801 --> 01:24:54,392
The place would still be full of her.

824
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:59,727
I wouldn't go within
a hundred miles of the place.

825
01:25:04,233 --> 01:25:05,755
I need to sit.

826
01:25:20,266 --> 01:25:21,663
I'm sorry.

827
01:25:22,498 --> 01:25:24,021
Whatever for?

828
01:25:34,098 --> 01:25:35,564
Everything.

829
01:25:36,598 --> 01:25:38,120
It's all right.

830
01:25:39,798 --> 01:25:41,059
Truly.

831
01:25:43,864 --> 01:25:45,887
I asked too much of you.

832
01:25:48,531 --> 01:25:50,656
I knew it all along, really.

833
01:25:52,764 --> 01:25:55,525
Only God can give you that sort of love.

834
01:26:03,164 --> 01:26:05,153
Come home, Sebastian.

835
01:26:07,463 --> 01:26:09,429
When you're well enough.

836
01:26:10,963 --> 01:26:13,088
Don't finish it like this.

837
01:26:16,463 --> 01:26:18,224
This is my life now.

838
01:26:20,630 --> 01:26:22,220
I'm happy here.

839
01:26:27,163 --> 01:26:28,685
I miss you.

840
01:26:31,229 --> 01:26:33,421
How sweet of you to say that.

841
01:26:36,162 --> 01:26:37,685
Dear Charles,

842
01:26:41,228 --> 01:26:44,319
it was my fault for
bringing you to Brideshead.

843
01:26:49,861 --> 01:26:51,225
Run away.

844
01:26:53,394 --> 01:26:56,088
Run far away and don't ever look back.

845
01:27:50,025 --> 01:27:51,423
I'm sorry.

846
01:28:19,091 --> 01:28:21,284
You must be so proud of him.

847
01:28:21,857 --> 01:28:24,119
- Was he away long?
- Two years,

848
01:28:24,224 --> 01:28:25,951
and it doesn't feel like a day.

849
01:29:15,822 --> 01:29:17,378
Hello, Charles.

850
01:29:24,854 --> 01:29:27,150
Did you know I was on the boat?

851
01:29:29,088 --> 01:29:31,781
If I said no, you wouldn't believe me.

852
01:29:37,554 --> 01:29:39,315
You're married now.

853
01:29:40,421 --> 01:29:41,512
Yes.

854
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:50,652
- You haven't changed at all.
- Neither have you.

855
01:29:55,620 --> 01:29:57,950
- How ridiculous.
- Yes, isn't it?

856
01:30:01,787 --> 01:30:03,685
Tell me this is fate.

857
01:31:28,449 --> 01:31:30,176
- What?
- Nothing.

858
01:31:31,649 --> 01:31:32,978
Tell me.

859
01:31:33,782 --> 01:31:36,214
I was thinking about Sebastian.

860
01:31:37,015 --> 01:31:40,038
Mummy died without
ever seeing him again.

861
01:31:43,982 --> 01:31:45,242
I know.

862
01:31:49,848 --> 01:31:51,746
Let's go up on deck.

863
01:31:52,615 --> 01:31:55,638
- Are you sure?
- They're all asleep! Come on!

864
01:31:59,181 --> 01:32:00,544
Come on!

865
01:32:11,614 --> 01:32:12,807
Sorry.

866
01:32:17,347 --> 01:32:19,812
- So where's Rex?
- I drowned him.

867
01:32:20,547 --> 01:32:22,206
Forgive me, Rex!

868
01:32:36,413 --> 01:32:38,436
Lady Julia, fancy meeting you here.

869
01:32:38,513 --> 01:32:41,172
- Mr. Ryder.
- Could I possibly get you a drink?

870
01:32:41,246 --> 01:32:42,473
Dry martini, please.

871
01:32:42,546 --> 01:32:44,841
One dry Martini,
one whiskey with water.

872
01:32:44,912 --> 01:32:46,571
Please, allow me.

873
01:32:56,612 --> 01:32:58,237
So, why did you marry Rex?

874
01:32:58,312 --> 01:33:01,278
I don't know. Because he wasn't you.

875
01:33:01,778 --> 01:33:04,835
- Because he was rich.
- Because he was Catholic.

876
01:33:05,211 --> 01:33:08,041
Because Mummy approved,
God rest her soul.

877
01:33:10,111 --> 01:33:13,009
I thought he was my painted savage.

878
01:33:14,177 --> 01:33:17,008
It turns out he was
thoroughly up to date.

879
01:33:19,277 --> 01:33:20,368
Thank you.

880
01:33:20,444 --> 01:33:23,433
Now, no more talk about Rex.
He's in England.

881
01:33:32,376 --> 01:33:35,308
- Do you have children?
- No.

882
01:33:36,810 --> 01:33:37,969
No.

883
01:33:41,443 --> 01:33:44,637
- What will you tell your wife?
- Wait until London.

884
01:33:46,310 --> 01:33:50,106
I have a viewing to arrange.
I'll sort it out. It'll be fine.

885
01:33:50,909 --> 01:33:53,898
- Where shall we go?
- Somewhere abroad, like Daddy.

886
01:33:53,976 --> 01:33:56,840
- What about Italy? Capri?
- Antibes.

887
01:33:56,909 --> 01:33:57,897
- Seville.
- Verona.

888
01:33:57,976 --> 01:33:59,703
- Paris.
- Brideshead.

889
01:33:59,776 --> 01:34:01,674
- No!
- Why not?

890
01:34:02,941 --> 01:34:05,998
- It's the loveliest place on earth.
- I can't go back there.

891
01:34:06,075 --> 01:34:07,870
- Not after this.
- Nonsense.

892
01:34:07,941 --> 01:34:10,634
- We've nothing to apologize for.
- No.

893
01:34:12,775 --> 01:34:14,332
Besides, Rex is there.

894
01:34:14,409 --> 01:34:17,431
Leave it to me.
I'll settle things with Rex.

895
01:34:18,474 --> 01:34:20,440
I'll settle everything.

896
01:34:23,941 --> 01:34:25,236
Trust me.

897
01:34:26,474 --> 01:34:27,667
I do.

898
01:34:28,641 --> 01:34:30,970
- And stop worrying!
- I will.

899
01:34:46,307 --> 01:34:49,296
Good afternoon, ma'am.
- Lovely day.

900
01:34:52,307 --> 01:34:54,034
Mr. and Mrs. Ryder.

901
01:34:55,340 --> 01:34:59,067
Look, that's the Duke
and Duchess of Clarence.

902
01:34:59,606 --> 01:35:02,970
- They want to buy one!
- How very gracious of them.

903
01:35:05,139 --> 01:35:09,834
Make an effort, Charles.
I've got you the cream of Mayfair.

904
01:35:13,139 --> 01:35:14,832
Mrs. Ryder, good day.

905
01:35:14,905 --> 01:35:18,429
Charles, how charming you look.

906
01:35:21,538 --> 01:35:22,799
Anthony.

907
01:35:23,306 --> 01:35:26,465
I heard, quite by chance, at a luncheon,
that you were having an exhibition.

908
01:35:26,538 --> 01:35:30,527
So, of course, I dashed impetuously
to the shrine to pay homage.

909
01:35:30,938 --> 01:35:32,836
Where are the pictures?

910
01:35:34,471 --> 01:35:36,562
Let me explain them to you.

911
01:35:47,437 --> 01:35:48,960
This is simply charm.

912
01:35:49,038 --> 01:35:53,527
Simple, creamy, English charm,
playing tigers.

913
01:35:56,470 --> 01:35:58,459
But enough of art.

914
01:35:58,537 --> 01:36:02,696
They tell me you are happy in love
and that is everything, isn't it?

915
01:36:02,770 --> 01:36:04,793
Or nearly everything.

916
01:36:06,170 --> 01:36:08,294
Everyone's talking about it.

917
01:36:08,369 --> 01:36:11,858
So, it's Julia now.
And it used to be Sebastian.

918
01:36:13,102 --> 01:36:15,398
Do you think I should warn her?

919
01:36:15,703 --> 01:36:17,635
Warn her about what?

920
01:36:18,736 --> 01:36:23,134
How apropos that you'd have
chosen jungles for your canvas.

921
01:36:25,303 --> 01:36:28,098
I always thought you
were the lamb to be slaughtered,

922
01:36:28,169 --> 01:36:30,999
when all along it is they
who are hunted.

923
01:36:32,635 --> 01:36:37,033
There really is no end to your hunger,
is there, Charles?

924
01:36:55,534 --> 01:36:58,193
Why do I feel so nervous?
- Don't be.

925
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:08,189
- Who are all these people?
- Politicians, money men.

926
01:37:08,933 --> 01:37:10,728
Rex thinks there's a war
coming with Hitler.

927
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:12,561
He wants to do well out of it.

928
01:37:12,633 --> 01:37:15,360
- It's all he talks about.
- Hello, Julia.

929
01:37:15,433 --> 01:37:17,592
- Hello, Rex.
- Good evening, Rex.

930
01:37:17,667 --> 01:37:20,189
Mr. Ryder,
welcome back to Brideshead.

931
01:37:20,266 --> 01:37:22,824
I hear you're making
quite a name for yourself.

932
01:37:22,900 --> 01:37:26,297
- Could I have a word with you?
- Later, I have guests.

933
01:37:32,932 --> 01:37:34,296
It's cold.

934
01:37:41,033 --> 01:37:42,464
Not here!

935
01:37:45,732 --> 01:37:48,630
- Sorry.
- Let's go back to London.

936
01:37:48,699 --> 01:37:52,358
- Let me settle everything with Rex.
- And then we'll leave?

937
01:37:53,032 --> 01:37:55,827
- Yes? Charles?
- Yes.

938
01:37:57,531 --> 01:37:59,554
If that's what you want.

939
01:38:11,398 --> 01:38:13,091
Hello, Bridey.

940
01:38:13,164 --> 01:38:16,130
- Hello, Julia. Just up from London?
- Yes.

941
01:38:16,897 --> 01:38:19,159
Welcome back to Brideshead, Charles.

942
01:38:19,231 --> 01:38:22,026
- How's your family?
- Fine, thank you.

943
01:38:23,630 --> 01:38:27,153
- Rex still entertaining?
- He's got business.

944
01:38:30,896 --> 01:38:33,760
I'm sorry he's not here.
I have a little announcement to make.

945
01:38:33,829 --> 01:38:35,761
Well, come on. Out with it.

946
01:38:35,829 --> 01:38:39,353
- I'm engaged to be married.
- Congratulations, Bridey.

947
01:38:39,430 --> 01:38:41,987
Well, who is she?

948
01:38:42,063 --> 01:38:44,654
- No one you know.
- Is she pretty?

949
01:38:45,163 --> 01:38:48,253
I don't think you could
exactly call her pretty.

950
01:38:48,362 --> 01:38:51,419
"Comely" is the word
I think of in her connection.

951
01:38:51,496 --> 01:38:53,325
She is a big woman.

952
01:38:53,396 --> 01:38:55,157
- Fat?
- No, big.

953
01:38:55,862 --> 01:38:58,919
She's called Mrs. Muspratt.
Her Christian name is Beryl.

954
01:38:58,995 --> 01:39:01,120
But, Bridey, where did you find her?

955
01:39:01,195 --> 01:39:04,991
Her late husband, Admiral Muspratt,
collected matchboxes.

956
01:39:05,428 --> 01:39:08,826
You're not marrying her
for her matchboxes, are you, Bridey?

957
01:39:08,895 --> 01:39:10,121
No, no.

958
01:39:10,628 --> 01:39:12,526
Matchboxes were left
to Falmouth Town Library.

959
01:39:12,595 --> 01:39:16,288
I'm just holding them for collection.
Why are you laughing?

960
01:39:16,894 --> 01:39:19,655
- I hope you'll be very happy.
- Thank you.

961
01:39:20,261 --> 01:39:23,624
- I think I'm very fortunate.
- You sly, old thing.

962
01:39:23,694 --> 01:39:25,853
When are we going to meet her?
You must bring her here.

963
01:39:25,927 --> 01:39:27,654
- I couldn't do that.
- Why not?

964
01:39:27,727 --> 01:39:28,784
Well, you must understand,

965
01:39:28,861 --> 01:39:31,759
Beryl is a woman
of strict Catholic principle,

966
01:39:31,827 --> 01:39:35,088
fortified by the prejudices
of the middle classes.

967
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:37,683
I couldn't possibly bring her here.

968
01:39:38,327 --> 01:39:39,623
I don't understand.

969
01:39:39,694 --> 01:39:41,091
It may be a matter of indifference
to you,

970
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:44,251
whether or not you choose
to live in sin with Charles,

971
01:39:44,327 --> 01:39:47,781
but on no account would Beryl
consent to be your guest.

972
01:39:48,327 --> 01:39:50,884
How dare you talk to her like that?

973
01:39:53,126 --> 01:39:55,684
Bloody offensive thing to say!

974
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:57,282
Really, there was nothing
she could object to.

975
01:39:57,359 --> 01:40:00,450
I was merely stating
a fact well known to her.

976
01:40:21,392 --> 01:40:23,949
Take no notice of him, my darling.

977
01:40:26,824 --> 01:40:27,812
So,

978
01:40:29,491 --> 01:40:32,014
got you. Sorry about the delay.

979
01:40:33,058 --> 01:40:34,819
I'll be outside.

980
01:40:46,957 --> 01:40:50,946
The door? Door's made
from all the works of Dickens.

981
01:40:51,024 --> 01:40:54,081
I had it installed especially. Want one?

982
01:40:55,257 --> 01:40:56,813
No, thank you.

983
01:41:01,189 --> 01:41:03,382
I know what you're thinking.

984
01:41:07,657 --> 01:41:10,816
How vulgar can it get?
You wanna know the secret?

985
01:41:15,989 --> 01:41:17,818
I do it on purpose.

986
01:41:17,889 --> 01:41:21,286
It amuses me to offend
their delicate sensibilities.

987
01:41:22,822 --> 01:41:25,287
So, you wanna take my wife off me?

988
01:41:25,355 --> 01:41:28,549
You know she can't marry
a divorcé, right?

989
01:41:29,055 --> 01:41:31,953
- Against the rules.
- Well, at least she'll be free of you.

990
01:41:32,022 --> 01:41:33,488
She'll never be free.

991
01:41:33,555 --> 01:41:35,214
Don't pretend
you've been faithful to her.

992
01:41:35,289 --> 01:41:37,050
Who said anything about faith?

993
01:41:37,122 --> 01:41:41,281
I bet you'd love to get your hands
on the house, though, wouldn't you?

994
01:41:41,354 --> 01:41:44,946
All those pretty paintings.
All those pretty views.

995
01:41:45,022 --> 01:41:47,852
Let her go, Rex. You never loved her.

996
01:41:47,921 --> 01:41:50,113
The only thing you ever had
in common was religion.

997
01:41:50,187 --> 01:41:53,051
Wrong. When I decided to marry Julia,
I wasn't a Catholic.

998
01:41:53,121 --> 01:41:55,451
I converted before the wedding.

999
01:41:57,221 --> 01:41:59,482
Bet she didn't tell you that.

1000
01:41:59,954 --> 01:42:02,749
- I guessed.
- Oh, yeah?

1001
01:42:04,021 --> 01:42:05,714
You're the type.

1002
01:42:10,953 --> 01:42:12,510
You people,

1003
01:42:14,153 --> 01:42:15,948
you never learn.

1004
01:42:18,186 --> 01:42:21,175
You could have had it all
if you'd been a little more flexible.

1005
01:42:21,253 --> 01:42:22,616
I did what I had to do.

1006
01:42:22,686 --> 01:42:24,845
They want a Catholic,
I'll convert to Catholicism.

1007
01:42:24,919 --> 01:42:26,044
It's a great religion.

1008
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:29,813
You sin all you want, then you confess.
Problem solved.

1009
01:42:29,886 --> 01:42:31,976
You gotta woo these people.

1010
01:42:32,819 --> 01:42:34,341
This family don't live in the real world.

1011
01:42:34,419 --> 01:42:37,873
- They're mortgaged up to the hilt.
- Get to the point.

1012
01:42:44,918 --> 01:42:48,213
You want my wife? Make me an offer.

1013
01:42:48,918 --> 01:42:52,816
- I'm not just giving her away.
- Don't do this. It's demeaning.

1014
01:42:54,652 --> 01:42:56,447
Try a little harder.

1015
01:42:58,585 --> 01:43:00,483
You're a rich man, Rex,
you've already got what you wanted.

1016
01:43:00,551 --> 01:43:03,483
You can never have enough
of what you want.

1017
01:43:08,151 --> 01:43:09,810
No, you're right.

1018
01:43:10,384 --> 01:43:13,179
You're taking her off my hands.
That's a favor.

1019
01:43:13,250 --> 01:43:15,773
I'll tell you what I'll do.

1020
01:43:16,917 --> 01:43:22,815
You give me a couple of your jungle
pics, and I'll give you an annulment.

1021
01:43:22,883 --> 01:43:25,315
I hear you're worth collecting.

1022
01:43:30,349 --> 01:43:33,804
Come on, Charlie boy, say yes.
You know you want to.

1023
01:43:36,383 --> 01:43:38,406
You don't have to speak.

1024
01:43:41,650 --> 01:43:43,013
Just nod.

1025
01:44:01,415 --> 01:44:02,903
I'll have my driver take me to London.

1026
01:44:02,981 --> 01:44:05,913
He can pick up the paintings
in the morning.

1027
01:44:14,748 --> 01:44:18,441
You know she's mad.
Can't even give you children.

1028
01:44:20,481 --> 01:44:22,379
Lost the only one we had.

1029
01:44:42,847 --> 01:44:44,039
Julia?

1030
01:45:04,112 --> 01:45:06,203
I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

1031
01:45:08,312 --> 01:45:10,710
- It's just a shock.
- Shh.

1032
01:45:10,945 --> 01:45:12,808
Shh. Don't.

1033
01:45:15,445 --> 01:45:18,104
I've always known, ever since nursery.

1034
01:45:19,711 --> 01:45:23,336
I tried to be good, I really did.
I tried. I married Rex.

1035
01:45:24,444 --> 01:45:27,239
All through the backgammon
and cigars, I tried.

1036
01:45:27,311 --> 01:45:30,936
But it's not enough. It's never enough.

1037
01:45:33,011 --> 01:45:34,806
God had to punish me.

1038
01:45:35,977 --> 01:45:38,466
So he took my little stillborn...

1039
01:45:38,944 --> 01:45:41,172
My child. My girl.

1040
01:45:42,677 --> 01:45:45,734
With you, I thought I could
really and truly be free.

1041
01:45:45,810 --> 01:45:48,640
But coming back here, it's like a thread,

1042
01:45:48,710 --> 01:45:52,733
an invisible thread drawing you back,
inch by inch,

1043
01:45:53,610 --> 01:45:56,542
until all of a sudden,
you're a child again.

1044
01:45:57,210 --> 01:45:58,766
And that voice inside your head,

1045
01:45:58,843 --> 01:46:01,968
the one that Mummy planted
all those years ago in the nursery,

1046
01:46:02,043 --> 01:46:05,032
every night in the nursery,
filling your head with it.

1047
01:46:05,110 --> 01:46:07,302
And the voice is telling you,
whispering,

1048
01:46:07,376 --> 01:46:10,570
"Wicked little Julia,
bad little girl, living in sin."

1049
01:46:10,643 --> 01:46:13,666
And here I am again with you,
living in sin.

1050
01:46:16,808 --> 01:46:18,865
It's over. It's over now.

1051
01:46:39,675 --> 01:46:42,038
- Everything set?
- That's everything, sir.

1052
01:46:42,108 --> 01:46:44,767
- Thank you, Wilcox.
- Best of luck, sir.

1053
01:47:09,640 --> 01:47:11,072
Who's that?

1054
01:47:15,539 --> 01:47:18,300
Go back. Turn around.
I have to go back.

1055
01:47:21,373 --> 01:47:23,669
- Staff, immediately!
- Yes, sir.

1056
01:47:25,172 --> 01:47:27,104
Come on, quickly now!

1057
01:47:31,072 --> 01:47:32,867
I'll help with that.

1058
01:47:33,705 --> 01:47:35,171
Come on, hurry!
- Yes, sir.

1059
01:47:35,239 --> 01:47:36,602
Shall I help, Tompkins?
- Hurry!

1060
01:47:36,672 --> 01:47:40,002
The sedan chair.
- Right, very gently. Very gently.

1061
01:47:42,171 --> 01:47:44,103
Hurry.
- Get a move with the chair.

1062
01:47:44,171 --> 01:47:46,160
Come along, come along.

1063
01:47:47,038 --> 01:47:48,936
Somebody got the rug?

1064
01:47:51,338 --> 01:47:52,769
Up. Gently.

1065
01:47:53,138 --> 01:47:56,831
Clear the stairs, please.
- Could I have the medical bag?

1066
01:47:59,105 --> 01:48:01,627
- Father!
- Dear Julia.

1067
01:48:02,137 --> 01:48:04,160
Come on, please. Come on!

1068
01:48:12,703 --> 01:48:14,294
I'm sorry, I was to call,

1069
01:48:14,371 --> 01:48:17,495
but we have been traveling
without a stop for three days.

1070
01:48:17,570 --> 01:48:19,593
It was Cordelia,
she was visiting us in Venice...

1071
01:48:19,670 --> 01:48:21,260
What happened?
- We want the bed ready

1072
01:48:21,336 --> 01:48:22,563
as soon as possible.

1073
01:48:22,637 --> 01:48:26,626
His heart. Some long word at the heart.

1074
01:48:27,136 --> 01:48:28,432
Hurry up.

1075
01:48:29,503 --> 01:48:30,934
He's dying.

1076
01:48:31,769 --> 01:48:33,735
He has come home to die.

1077
01:48:38,270 --> 01:48:39,929
Come on, everybody, that's it.
Chop-chop.

1078
01:48:40,003 --> 01:48:40,991
Come along.

1079
01:48:41,069 --> 01:48:43,466
We must get Lord Marchmain
to the great dining room.

1080
01:48:52,569 --> 01:48:54,057
Thank you.

1081
01:49:01,468 --> 01:49:03,025
He's sleeping.

1082
01:49:04,868 --> 01:49:07,027
Do you think we should
let Sebastian know?

1083
01:49:07,101 --> 01:49:09,465
You could, but I doubt he'd come.

1084
01:49:09,534 --> 01:49:13,091
The last I heard of him,
he was still struggling rather.

1085
01:49:13,401 --> 01:49:16,696
The monks have him as a porter
in the hospital in Morocco.

1086
01:49:16,767 --> 01:49:18,529
He seems to like it.

1087
01:49:18,667 --> 01:49:22,293
I think they've rather taken him
under their wing, dear old thing.

1088
01:49:22,368 --> 01:49:25,856
Still, salvation of a sort.

1089
01:49:28,166 --> 01:49:30,860
Bridey, you need to call for a priest.

1090
01:49:31,700 --> 01:49:34,131
I'll have a word with Father Mackay
about dropping in this evening.

1091
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:36,893
Julia, your father doesn't want a priest.

1092
01:49:37,433 --> 01:49:39,955
All he wants is to die in his old home.

1093
01:49:40,033 --> 01:49:45,330
Our father's soul, all sinners' souls,
face mortal danger.

1094
01:49:46,332 --> 01:49:49,560
It is our duty as Catholics
to see that we do all in our power

1095
01:49:49,633 --> 01:49:52,895
to save those we love from themselves.

1096
01:50:35,031 --> 01:50:36,621
Hateful woman.

1097
01:50:37,797 --> 01:50:39,592
She wants me dead.

1098
01:50:42,264 --> 01:50:43,923
What about you?

1099
01:50:44,963 --> 01:50:47,861
- Do you want me dead?
- No.

1100
01:50:57,063 --> 01:50:59,927
You know the family
are sending for a priest.

1101
01:50:59,997 --> 01:51:03,520
They seem determined
to drag God into it.

1102
01:51:04,696 --> 01:51:06,718
Why should you care?

1103
01:51:07,429 --> 01:51:09,452
You don't believe in God.

1104
01:51:10,662 --> 01:51:12,525
You said so yourself.

1105
01:51:14,562 --> 01:51:17,323
Have you suddenly
become my conscience?

1106
01:51:19,462 --> 01:51:22,394
I've already seen Sebastian
ruined by God.

1107
01:51:22,462 --> 01:51:27,156
I don't see why I should watch it
happen again with your daughter.

1108
01:51:29,061 --> 01:51:31,391
How very caring of you.

1109
01:51:32,694 --> 01:51:34,717
You forget, I was there.

1110
01:51:35,794 --> 01:51:38,954
I watched that woman crucify my son,

1111
01:51:39,361 --> 01:51:42,816
little by little, and I was silent.

1112
01:51:44,894 --> 01:51:47,382
What does that say about me?

1113
01:51:47,461 --> 01:51:49,790
You're not responsible
for what she did.

1114
01:51:49,860 --> 01:51:53,622
But are we not also
our brother's keeper?

1115
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:57,983
You, Charles, and me?

1116
01:52:01,393 --> 01:52:03,359
I let Sebastian down.

1117
01:52:06,293 --> 01:52:08,259
I let everyone down.

1118
01:52:12,859 --> 01:52:14,416
This way, sir.

1119
01:52:24,626 --> 01:52:26,216
Dear, no, that's too many!

1120
01:52:26,292 --> 01:52:28,383
- Papa...
- Your father needs to rest!

1121
01:52:28,459 --> 01:52:30,652
- Get him away.
- I've brought Father Mackay to see you.

1122
01:52:30,726 --> 01:52:34,748
- Get him away! Get him away!
- Out!

1123
01:52:34,825 --> 01:52:37,348
Everybody out! Out! Out!

1124
01:52:38,691 --> 01:52:42,919
- I'm so sorry, Father.
- Not at all. Give him time.

1125
01:52:42,992 --> 01:52:46,152
I've known worse cases
make beautiful deaths.

1126
01:52:50,391 --> 01:52:53,152
What were you talking
to my father about?

1127
01:52:57,258 --> 01:52:59,247
He doesn't want a priest.

1128
01:53:01,458 --> 01:53:03,083
Please, Charles.

1129
01:53:03,490 --> 01:53:06,752
Please don't interfere with matters
that don't concern you.

1130
01:53:06,824 --> 01:53:08,154
Julia...

1131
01:53:12,290 --> 01:53:14,222
Let's get out of here.

1132
01:53:14,290 --> 01:53:16,051
We'll go to Italy.

1133
01:53:17,357 --> 01:53:20,517
- Capri.
- I can't leave now, my father's dying.

1134
01:53:21,923 --> 01:53:25,412
When this is over,
I can make you happy.

1135
01:53:40,422 --> 01:53:44,013
- Why should I believe you?
- Believe me.

1136
01:53:44,588 --> 01:53:46,747
You just bought me from Rex.

1137
01:53:51,155 --> 01:53:53,178
What are you talking about?

1138
01:53:53,255 --> 01:53:55,983
According to you,
I'm worth two pictures.

1139
01:53:58,788 --> 01:54:01,345
I thought I'd fetch at least three.

1140
01:54:03,521 --> 01:54:05,510
Don't be ridiculous.

1141
01:54:07,988 --> 01:54:10,886
- That was Rex.
- You agreed to it, Charles.

1142
01:54:11,587 --> 01:54:13,780
- I had no choice!
- You agreed!

1143
01:54:13,854 --> 01:54:14,877
I thought I was doing the right thing.

1144
01:54:14,954 --> 01:54:15,977
I thought I was doing what you wanted.

1145
01:54:16,054 --> 01:54:19,747
No, you thought you were getting me
and the house, together.

1146
01:54:19,821 --> 01:54:23,617
- Is that really what you think?
- You tell me. Please, tell me.

1147
01:54:23,687 --> 01:54:26,312
What does Charles Ryder really want?

1148
01:54:47,253 --> 01:54:51,617
Can you imagine what it was like
for me to be invited into Brideshead?

1149
01:54:54,019 --> 01:54:55,349
Me,

1150
01:54:57,119 --> 01:54:58,880
Charles Ryder,

1151
01:55:00,019 --> 01:55:03,951
"the painter from Paddington,"
as your mother so sweetly put it.

1152
01:55:04,985 --> 01:55:07,849
There was no humiliation
I would not have endured

1153
01:55:07,918 --> 01:55:10,248
just to be part of that dream.

1154
01:55:11,619 --> 01:55:16,074
And your mother, that woman is more
alive now than she ever was.

1155
01:55:16,151 --> 01:55:20,810
She's in every brick,
every stone, every slate.

1156
01:55:25,684 --> 01:55:27,513
Sebastian was right.

1157
01:55:35,783 --> 01:55:37,772
We should run away.

1158
01:55:40,817 --> 01:55:44,510
- Why did you bring me here?
- We can still leave.

1159
01:56:31,448 --> 01:56:34,073
- Bridey...
- Don't interfere, Charles.

1160
01:57:00,614 --> 01:57:05,273
Now, try and remember your sins
and tell God you're sorry.

1161
01:57:05,813 --> 01:57:08,506
I'm going to give you absolution now.

1162
01:57:08,579 --> 01:57:10,374
And while I'm giving it,

1163
01:57:10,446 --> 01:57:13,435
I want you to tell God you're sorry
you offended him,

1164
01:57:13,512 --> 01:57:17,000
and then I want you
to make a sign, if you can.

1165
01:57:28,412 --> 01:57:30,400
- Amen.
- Amen.

1166
01:57:59,744 --> 01:58:00,937
Amen.

1167
01:58:16,676 --> 01:58:20,802
Please, God,
please, if you're there, forgive him.

1168
01:58:22,010 --> 01:58:26,169
Forgive me. Oh, God, forgive me.
Let him have a sign.

1169
02:00:08,371 --> 02:00:11,065
Sebastian used to loathe this painting.

1170
02:00:13,638 --> 02:00:16,570
Daddy gave it to Mummy
as a wedding present.

1171
02:00:20,271 --> 02:00:21,532
Tell me.

1172
02:00:26,470 --> 02:00:29,925
I wanted too much.

1173
02:00:32,503 --> 02:00:34,264
It's nobody's fault.

1174
02:00:34,737 --> 02:00:37,897
But you're not coming with me.

1175
02:00:43,403 --> 02:00:46,096
I can't shut myself off from His mercy.

1176
02:00:49,036 --> 02:00:51,059
Can you understand that?

1177
02:00:54,336 --> 02:00:57,461
I don't want to make it easier for you.

1178
02:01:04,868 --> 02:01:07,891
I hope your heart

1179
02:01:09,835 --> 02:01:11,199
breaks.

1180
02:01:18,301 --> 02:01:20,096
But I do understand.

1181
02:01:25,968 --> 02:01:27,797
I have to let you go.

1182
02:02:47,297 --> 02:02:50,990
<i>Whether by fate or the
divine ironies of some higher power,</i>

1183
02:02:52,497 --> 02:02:56,224
<i>I find myself returned once more
to Brideshead.</i>

1184
02:02:56,297 --> 02:02:57,819
Let it go.

1185
02:03:09,763 --> 02:03:12,627
<i>Did I want too much?</i>

1186
02:03:15,530 --> 02:03:17,052
Get him out of my sight!

1187
02:03:17,129 --> 02:03:21,425
<i>Did my own hunger blind me to
the ties that bound them to their faith?</i>

1188
02:03:24,196 --> 02:03:29,389
<i>Am I only now, shadowed by war,
all moorings gone,</i>

1189
02:03:32,095 --> 02:03:34,425
<i>alone enough to see the light?</i>

1190
02:03:42,495 --> 02:03:44,017
Worst place we've struck yet.

1191
02:03:44,095 --> 02:03:45,617
No facilities, no amenities,

1192
02:03:45,695 --> 02:03:48,525
and the nearest village
is a five-mile walk.

1193
02:03:48,595 --> 02:03:50,925
Mind you, there's a rumor
of a big push coming.

1194
02:03:50,995 --> 02:03:53,256
They'll be shipping
us off to France soon.

1195
02:03:53,328 --> 02:03:54,919
Yes, very soon.

1196
02:03:56,494 --> 02:03:58,891
Where are the family now?
Does anyone know?

1197
02:03:58,961 --> 02:04:01,927
Some Lady Flyte lives
on her own here, normally.

1198
02:04:01,994 --> 02:04:04,051
She's overseas
with the women's service.

1199
02:04:04,127 --> 02:04:07,854
Her elder brother died in the Blitz.
They're all Roman Catholic.

1200
02:04:08,460 --> 02:04:13,018
- I take it you're not religious, Hooper.
- Me? God, no. Can't see the point in it.

1201
02:04:13,094 --> 02:04:15,787
You're born, you live, then you die.

1202
02:04:18,794 --> 02:04:20,555
Do you have any hopes
for the future, Hooper?

1203
02:04:20,627 --> 02:04:22,650
Hopes? Oh, aye, plenty.

1204
02:04:23,293 --> 02:04:27,419
It's our time now. You watch.
The old ways, all this, they're gone.

1205
02:04:27,893 --> 02:04:31,155
Future belongs to us,
so long as we don't get shot.

1206
02:04:32,626 --> 02:04:33,922
How about you, sir?

1207
02:04:33,993 --> 02:04:35,856
You got someone
special waiting for you?

1208
02:04:35,926 --> 02:04:37,653
Me? No.

1209
02:04:38,759 --> 02:04:41,883
I've loved and lost
for more than one lifetime.

1210
02:04:43,559 --> 02:04:45,751
Would you like me
to drive you back, sir?

1211
02:04:45,825 --> 02:04:48,620
No, not yet. Carry on, Hooper.

1212
02:04:49,059 --> 02:04:50,649
Very good, sir.

1213
02:05:00,191 --> 02:05:01,986
Sergeant!
