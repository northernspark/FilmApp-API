<i>Four days till we deploy.</i>

<i>Grace knows I would do
anything to get back to her.</i>

00:01:25,269 --> 00:01:26,463
<i>Anything.</i>

00:01:29,106 --> 00:01:31,132
<i>Today I wrote her a letter.</i>

7
00:01:42,787 --> 00:01:46,416
Good afternoon, sir. I have the briefing
papers from the colonel's office.

8
00:01:46,558 --> 00:01:48,287
Put them on the desk.

9
00:01:52,765 --> 00:01:54,027
Thank you, Corporal.

10
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,437
Major. Hey.

11
00:02:03,876 --> 00:02:05,776
Hope you don't have to deliver it.

12
00:02:07,446 --> 00:02:08,470
Copy that.

13
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:10,610
- Be safe out there, Sam.
- Thanks, sir.

14
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,980
- See you when you get back.
- All right.

15
00:02:21,094 --> 00:02:22,391
How's this?

16
00:02:22,529 --> 00:02:23,587
Warm.

17
00:02:27,534 --> 00:02:28,865
- Hello.
- Dad!

18
00:02:29,002 --> 00:02:31,061
Hey! Hey, baby.

19
00:02:31,205 --> 00:02:32,365
- Hi, Daddy.
- How you doing?

20
00:02:32,506 --> 00:02:34,167
- How was school?
- Great.

21
00:02:35,242 --> 00:02:38,371
They gave me Noodles the
dog. She's in my room.

22
00:02:40,014 --> 00:02:41,311
Izzie?

23
00:02:42,884 --> 00:02:44,181
Hey.

24
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:47,214
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

25
00:02:47,956 --> 00:02:49,890
What's wrong, honey?

26
00:02:50,024 --> 00:02:51,753
You're leaving again.

27
00:02:52,694 --> 00:02:54,355
Come give your daddy a hug.

28
00:02:55,063 --> 00:02:55,995
No.

29
00:02:57,065 --> 00:02:58,897
Come on. Give me a kiss, honey.

30
00:02:59,034 --> 00:03:00,194
Just go.

31
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:03,101
- Two kisses?
- No.

32
00:03:04,073 --> 00:03:05,472
Three kisses?

33
00:03:06,141 --> 00:03:08,006
I wanna read my book.

34
00:03:08,143 --> 00:03:10,077
You wanna read your book?

35
00:03:11,714 --> 00:03:12,942
Oh, yeah?

36
00:03:14,984 --> 00:03:19,922
I see a smile coming. There it is! There
it is! Now, you're getting 100 kisses!

37
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,491
- Behind you! Right behind you!
- What? What? What? Who? Who?

38
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:28,663
Wait a second! Two against
one. That is no fair!

39
00:03:28,832 --> 00:03:30,322
Daddy, put me down!

40
00:03:30,467 --> 00:03:31,399
Girls.

41
00:03:32,302 --> 00:03:35,430
- Come on. Daddy's gotta go.
- Okay.

42
00:03:35,572 --> 00:03:39,008
Please stay. Please let him stay.

43
00:03:39,142 --> 00:03:42,704
- Yeah. Can't you stay?
- It's my brother.

44
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,678
He doesn't deserve you.

45
00:03:46,284 --> 00:03:48,411
Go rob another bank, Tommy!

46
00:03:48,886 --> 00:03:51,184
Bring that money back to me, brother!

47
00:04:00,331 --> 00:04:01,764
See you later.

48
00:04:26,025 --> 00:04:28,084
What happened to my little brother?

49
00:04:39,305 --> 00:04:40,567
No fucking way.

50
00:05:03,163 --> 00:05:05,893
You ever think of
apologizing to that woman?

51
00:05:08,602 --> 00:05:09,865
It's green.

52
00:05:10,705 --> 00:05:11,899
I got it.

53
00:05:24,252 --> 00:05:26,243
So, what are you gonna do?

54
00:05:26,388 --> 00:05:31,691
I don't know. I'm just gonna cash
this check, and then who knows.

55
00:05:32,228 --> 00:05:33,991
- I'll see you later?
- Yeah, all right. All right.

56
00:05:34,163 --> 00:05:36,723
- Don't rob the place.
- Yeah. Get the fuck out of here.

57
00:05:51,647 --> 00:05:53,548
No hot water in this place?

58
00:05:55,452 --> 00:05:57,352
Fucking hot water is missing.

59
00:06:05,262 --> 00:06:06,354
I'm sorry.

60
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,657
How do you stand this kitchen?

61
00:06:09,232 --> 00:06:11,666
He didn't expect to be
deploying again so soon.

62
00:06:11,802 --> 00:06:13,531
Yeah. Well, are you
ripping your hair out?

63
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,969
What are you gonna do?
They call, you answer.

64
00:06:16,107 --> 00:06:17,699
- Don't tell her. Oh, no.
- Yes!

65
00:06:17,842 --> 00:06:19,742
- I won.
- She got you, Granddad.

66
00:06:19,877 --> 00:06:21,777
You're raising a real
hustler here, Grace.

67
00:06:21,913 --> 00:06:23,244
I know.

68
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,946
My birthday's this spring.

69
00:06:30,087 --> 00:06:32,521
It is, isn't it? What is it,
March 10th, something like that?

70
00:06:37,195 --> 00:06:38,754
- Hi.
- Hi.

71
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:41,456
- Are you Isabelle?
- No, I'm Maggie.

72
00:06:41,633 --> 00:06:43,123
Isabelle's big.

73
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:45,893
I'm Tommy.

74
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:47,561
Mom doesn't like you.

75
00:06:47,739 --> 00:06:48,831
Maggie!

76
00:06:48,974 --> 00:06:51,340
What? That's what you said to Dad.

77
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,409
These are for your mom.

78
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,438
Mom, they're for you.

79
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,845
Thank you.

80
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:00,779
Come in.

81
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,020
- Hey. Hi, sweetie.
- Hey.

82
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,682
Come here.

83
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,684
Hi.

84
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:10,461
You made it.

85
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:12,787
Yeah.

86
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,631
- Son.
- Sir.

87
00:07:21,342 --> 00:07:23,503
- What? Hi.
- Hi.

88
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:26,511
Bless us, O Lord, in these thy
gifts which we are about to receive

89
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:28,581
from thy bounty through
Christ, our Lord. Amen.

90
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:29,944
- Amen.
- Amen.

91
00:07:30,084 --> 00:07:34,453
And this is a very special meal for us
because we are welcoming one son home,

92
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:37,455
and we're sending another one off.

93
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:41,857
And we ask you, Lord, to keep him safe
and bring him back really soon. Right?

94
00:07:41,996 --> 00:07:42,985
- Yeah.
- Amen.

95
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,462
- Amen.
- Amen.

96
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:46,623
Here. You can do it.

97
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:48,564
- You wanna try?
- Thank you, Mom.

98
00:07:48,737 --> 00:07:51,171
- Here, let me.
- Thanks, Mama.

99
00:07:52,974 --> 00:07:54,236
Carrots are delicious.

100
00:08:01,716 --> 00:08:04,776
- Why aren't you eating your peas?
- I hate peas.

101
00:08:06,422 --> 00:08:07,684
I do, too.

102
00:08:08,691 --> 00:08:10,716
Honey, eat your peas.

103
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,792
Okay, Dad.

104
00:08:11,928 --> 00:08:13,259
I like peas.

105
00:08:14,096 --> 00:08:15,529
So do I.

106
00:08:15,665 --> 00:08:17,895
- When are you leaving?
- Tuesday.

107
00:08:21,203 --> 00:08:23,228
You love it over there, huh?

108
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,205
It's my job.

109
00:08:26,342 --> 00:08:28,470
They only shoot the bad guys.

110
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,808
Who are the bad guys?

111
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,517
The ones with the beards.

112
00:08:38,388 --> 00:08:40,253
Your brother's a hero.

113
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:44,283
He's serving his country, and
don't you ever forget that.

114
00:08:46,997 --> 00:08:49,330
Will you be here for my birthday?

115
00:08:50,168 --> 00:08:52,102
You know I will, sweetie.

116
00:08:53,738 --> 00:08:55,501
Sarah Miller's dad wasn't
there for her birthday.

117
00:08:55,907 --> 00:08:58,239
- Isabelle.
- It's true.

118
00:08:58,376 --> 00:09:00,936
She had to bring him a cake in prison.

119
00:09:02,213 --> 00:09:04,545
It's not just military families.

120
00:09:04,682 --> 00:09:07,276
There's a lot of folks
under pressure these days.

121
00:09:08,252 --> 00:09:10,982
They got problems in all walks of life.

122
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:15,325
Every family's got their
own set of problems.

123
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,329
They sure do.

124
00:09:23,202 --> 00:09:25,329
What is that supposed to mean?

125
00:09:29,341 --> 00:09:31,866
Every family has their
own set of problems.

126
00:09:32,044 --> 00:09:34,275
You sound like a damn parrot.

127
00:09:34,414 --> 00:09:35,676
Like a what?

128
00:09:35,815 --> 00:09:38,579
Why don't you try mimicking
your brother for a change?

129
00:09:38,718 --> 00:09:39,946
Dad.

130
00:09:41,588 --> 00:09:44,113
This food is great, Elsie. Thank you.

131
00:09:45,992 --> 00:09:47,550
Compared to what?

132
00:09:52,632 --> 00:09:53,997
Other food.

133
00:09:54,134 --> 00:09:55,659
Prison food?

134
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:56,895
Tommy!

135
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,739
Excuse me.

136
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,076
It's okay, honey.

137
00:10:11,218 --> 00:10:13,311
- No. No.
- It's his first night out.

138
00:10:13,454 --> 00:10:17,721
He comes waltzing in here with
no regard for anybody else.

139
00:10:17,859 --> 00:10:19,918
Doesn't even bother to apologize...

140
00:10:35,243 --> 00:10:36,904
Stay out of trouble.

141
00:10:39,582 --> 00:10:40,844
All right.

142
00:10:45,455 --> 00:10:47,821
You be safe over there. All right?

143
00:11:00,403 --> 00:11:02,099
This thing's not coming off.

144
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,634
- Try more soap.
- Yeah.

145
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:07,242
Almost got it.

146
00:11:11,548 --> 00:11:13,015
There we go.

147
00:11:15,285 --> 00:11:17,913
- Don't lose that.
- I'll do my best.

148
00:11:18,055 --> 00:11:19,249
Okay.

149
00:11:21,859 --> 00:11:25,091
- Take a lot of pictures when I'm gone.
- I always do.

150
00:11:29,801 --> 00:11:31,098
I love you.

151
00:11:31,936 --> 00:11:33,460
I love you, too.

152
00:12:03,068 --> 00:12:04,126
Sam?

153
00:12:06,372 --> 00:12:07,931
Take me with you.

154
00:12:09,643 --> 00:12:10,667
Sure.

155
00:12:14,714 --> 00:12:17,512
How about I go and
you stay with the kids?

156
00:12:20,153 --> 00:12:21,279
Okay.

157
00:12:25,425 --> 00:12:26,858
Don't go.

158
00:12:33,201 --> 00:12:34,896
<i>October 12, 2007.</i>

159
00:12:35,803 --> 00:12:38,203
<i>Back in Afghanistan with my men.</i>

160
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:44,876
<i>Weird. It almost feels like home.</i>

161
00:13:22,185 --> 00:13:24,415
Hi, Cassie. Joe Jr. is so big.

162
00:13:47,678 --> 00:13:49,145
What's the distance to the LZ?

163
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,306
We're three minutes out.
Clear to detach to the LZ.

164
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:53,507
Roger that.

165
00:14:00,525 --> 00:14:02,959
<i>Clear to engage. Weapons hot.</i>

166
00:14:03,261 --> 00:14:06,458
<i>Target took cover in the valley.</i>

167
00:14:06,598 --> 00:14:07,792
Little bastards...

168
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:46,829
Who is it?

169
00:14:46,974 --> 00:14:50,034
It's Captain Sanderson
and Chaplain Davis.

170
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,512
Hi.

171
00:14:56,984 --> 00:14:59,179
- Hi. Is your mother home?
- Yeah.

172
00:15:01,355 --> 00:15:02,754
Where is she?

173
00:15:03,391 --> 00:15:04,790
In the bath.

174
00:15:07,362 --> 00:15:09,489
Would you call her for us, please?

175
00:15:13,935 --> 00:15:15,368
What's wrong?

176
00:15:18,106 --> 00:15:19,300
Izzie.

177
00:15:20,241 --> 00:15:22,106
- Okay.
- Bye.

178
00:15:36,725 --> 00:15:38,192
Come in.

179
00:16:12,797 --> 00:16:16,358
<i>You've reached Captain Sam
Cahill. Please leave a message.</i>

180
00:16:23,574 --> 00:16:27,135
<i>You've reached Captain Sam
Cahill. Please leave a message.</i>

181
00:16:43,195 --> 00:16:44,628
Grace.

182
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:48,899
Sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.

183
00:16:51,036 --> 00:16:52,298
I was just dropping off the car.

184
00:16:52,437 --> 00:16:55,839
Sam told me I could borrow
it whenever I wanted, so...

185
00:16:57,076 --> 00:17:01,172
The taillight's a little
busted. Some asshole...

186
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:08,347
Look, you know...

187
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:11,488
Just say it, you know
what I mean? All right.

188
00:17:11,624 --> 00:17:14,457
He told me I could borrow the
car whenever I wanted, Grace.

189
00:17:14,627 --> 00:17:16,061
You look at me with
this pissed-off look.

190
00:17:16,196 --> 00:17:17,629
Sam's dead.

191
00:17:21,034 --> 00:17:22,433
They crashed.

192
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:26,796
- What are you talking about?
- He's dead, Tommy.

193
00:17:27,407 --> 00:17:29,238
Come in, come in.

194
00:17:35,649 --> 00:17:37,811
I don't wanna fucking come in.

195
00:17:39,721 --> 00:17:41,985
I just came here to drop off...

196
00:17:42,824 --> 00:17:46,089
- Why didn't you call me?
- I've been trying to call you all night.

197
00:17:46,261 --> 00:17:50,163
- Why didn't anybody call me?
- We've all been trying, Tommy.

198
00:17:51,866 --> 00:17:53,094
Okay.

199
00:17:56,804 --> 00:17:57,031
- Why'd you let him go over there, Grace?
- Tommy.

200
00:18:02,044 --> 00:18:04,103
For what now, huh?

201
00:18:21,364 --> 00:18:22,991
Tommy, come inside.

202
00:18:25,001 --> 00:18:27,435
I just had to sit down for a second.

203
00:18:35,145 --> 00:18:37,978
He's with your mama
now. They're together.

204
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,242
Drink?

205
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,108
No.

206
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:48,844
Girls? You ready?

207
00:19:49,957 --> 00:19:52,482
Yeah, in about just one minute.

208
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:57,458
- Why'd you take your dress off?
- I hate it.

209
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:01,835
We're going to put it
on, okay? We have to go.

210
00:20:02,236 --> 00:20:03,726
I don't want to.

211
00:20:05,139 --> 00:20:08,108
I don't want to wear
mine either. It's itchy.

212
00:20:22,724 --> 00:20:24,555
Okay, come here. Okay.

213
00:20:25,427 --> 00:20:26,860
Come here.

214
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:35,028
- Okay.
- Is Dad really dead like your mom and dad?

215
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:26,814
- I'm sorry.
- I appreciate it.

216
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,494
- I'm so sorry, dear.
- Thanks for coming.

217
00:21:39,538 --> 00:21:41,972
Sir, your son's the best
damn Marine I ever commanded.

218
00:21:42,141 --> 00:21:43,574
I appreciate it.

219
00:21:46,979 --> 00:21:48,446
- Come on, girls.
- Coming, Grandpa.

220
00:21:48,614 --> 00:21:50,479
- Get in the car.
- Come on, Maggie.

221
00:21:50,616 --> 00:21:53,141
- Elsie, I'm sorry for your loss.
- I'll watch them.

222
00:21:53,285 --> 00:21:54,377
Okay.

223
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:59,457
Grace, Sam wrote this for you before he left.
He never wanted me to have to deliver it.

224
00:22:05,665 --> 00:22:07,633
I don't believe it, John.

225
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:10,059
I can't feel it.

226
00:22:11,771 --> 00:22:14,001
Shouldn't I be able to feel it?

227
00:22:14,974 --> 00:22:18,876
It's hard to accept. He was
a good friend, a good Marine.

228
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,548
- Why don't you let me drive?
- What are you talking about?

229
00:22:23,684 --> 00:22:26,050
- Come on, girls.
- Coming.

230
00:22:26,921 --> 00:22:29,185
Hey, why don't you
give me the keys, Dad?

231
00:22:29,323 --> 00:22:30,847
What makes you so
responsible all of a sudden?

232
00:22:33,194 --> 00:22:34,752
Let Tommy drive.

233
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,227
"Let Tommy drive."
Look, I'll tell you what.

234
00:22:37,364 --> 00:22:39,594
Why don't you get a
job and earn some money,

235
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:40,859
buy yourself a car,

236
00:22:41,001 --> 00:22:43,970
and then you can drive it
wherever the hell you want.

237
00:22:44,104 --> 00:22:45,595
Give me the keys.

238
00:22:48,176 --> 00:22:51,805
Did you hear those Marines in there
today talking about your brother?

239
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,174
Did you?

240
00:22:54,216 --> 00:22:58,585
Who is gonna stand up and
testify for you once you're dead?

241
00:22:59,721 --> 00:23:03,452
Yeah, it's my fault Sam's dead.
Right? That's what you think.

242
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,486
It's got nothing to do with you. Right?

243
00:23:08,431 --> 00:23:11,229
- What are you saying to me?
- Hank.

244
00:23:14,837 --> 00:23:15,769
Forget it.

245
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:18,636
You never had any guts.

246
00:23:18,774 --> 00:23:20,366
And you did.

247
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,875
That's why you screamed
at Mom every fucking night.

248
00:23:23,012 --> 00:23:25,606
That's why you drove us drunk,
huh? "Hang in there, Marines."

249
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:29,115
- Don't. Come on.
- Why you put all that shit in his head.

250
00:23:29,253 --> 00:23:31,380
- You could never fill his shoes.
- I know that.

251
00:23:31,522 --> 00:23:34,047
- Never could make me proud.
- For Lord's sake.

252
00:23:34,191 --> 00:23:35,818
That is a sin.

253
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:39,395
- Stop it. Give me the keys.
- Here you go. I'm walking.

254
00:25:11,225 --> 00:25:12,954
This is a nightmare.

255
00:25:14,428 --> 00:25:15,952
What's going on?

256
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:18,760
What are they gonna do with us?

257
00:25:21,069 --> 00:25:22,468
That yours?

258
00:25:23,405 --> 00:25:24,429
Yeah.

259
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,607
That your wife?

260
00:25:27,342 --> 00:25:28,741
Cassie, yeah.

261
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:31,878
No, she's not.

262
00:25:33,248 --> 00:25:35,011
You don't have a wife.

263
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,247
You don't have a family.

264
00:25:38,353 --> 00:25:40,514
I'm the only person you know.

265
00:25:41,057 --> 00:25:45,824
It's Private Willis and Captain
Cahill. You know nothing else.

266
00:25:46,996 --> 00:25:48,190
Yes, sir.

267
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:07,911
- Hello?
- Grace.

268
00:26:09,086 --> 00:26:10,018
<i>Tommy?</i>

269
00:26:11,088 --> 00:26:14,751
- Hi. I know it's like 1:00 in the morning.
- Yeah. It's 3:00.

270
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:17,054
It's 3:00 in the morning.

271
00:26:17,194 --> 00:26:18,684
Okay. I had...

272
00:26:19,797 --> 00:26:22,231
I had a couple of
drinks and, apparently,

273
00:26:22,366 --> 00:26:25,859
they're the most expensive
drinks in the world. And...

274
00:26:27,305 --> 00:26:29,330
Now I owe, like, $47.

275
00:26:31,443 --> 00:26:33,206
I was gonna just walk out, but then

276
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:36,438
this guy says that he was
gonna nick me on a disorderly.

277
00:26:37,415 --> 00:26:39,645
<i>And then I'd lose my parole, so...</i>

278
00:26:42,087 --> 00:26:43,349
Which bar?

279
00:26:54,834 --> 00:26:57,302
Your nose is like the lunar eclipse.

280
00:26:58,571 --> 00:27:01,039
- Come on, let me touch it. Let me just...
- Get your hands off me, Tommy.

281
00:27:01,173 --> 00:27:04,267
- Let me just touch it for a sec.
- Tommy, I'm sick of you. I'm sick of you.

282
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,536
Don't get so upset with me.

283
00:27:05,678 --> 00:27:07,373
- All right. Go ahead.
- Thanks.

284
00:27:07,513 --> 00:27:09,141
See. Nothing to it. Right?

285
00:27:09,282 --> 00:27:11,341
- Big deal.
- That thing's huge, man.

286
00:27:11,485 --> 00:27:13,077
- Hi.
- Great.

287
00:27:13,253 --> 00:27:16,154
- How much does he owe you?
- $47 and two broken glasses.

288
00:27:16,289 --> 00:27:18,257
- Well, how about we say...
- Ready?

289
00:27:18,425 --> 00:27:20,655
- Come on, Cyrano.
- Get your hands off the bar.

290
00:27:20,794 --> 00:27:24,252
- Don't try to ignore it. That thing's huge.
- How about we say $50. Okay?

291
00:27:24,397 --> 00:27:25,887
- I don't care about the money...
- That thing's huge.

292
00:27:26,032 --> 00:27:27,966
...just get him out of here. I'm
gonna call the cops. I'm done.

293
00:27:28,101 --> 00:27:31,936
Tommy, I have two little girls sleeping
in a parking lot at 3:00 in the morning.

294
00:27:32,073 --> 00:27:33,904
You think you're funny?

295
00:27:37,478 --> 00:27:38,706
Go home.

296
00:27:53,328 --> 00:27:54,693
Oh, God.

297
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,666
- My head's spinning.
- Be careful.

298
00:28:00,803 --> 00:28:04,330
- I don't think I should be carrying a child.
- Just put her in her bed, okay?

299
00:28:04,473 --> 00:28:05,838
Oh, my God.

300
00:28:13,549 --> 00:28:15,415
- Uncle Tommy.
- Oh, my God.

301
00:28:15,552 --> 00:28:17,452
Uncle Tommy, wake up.

302
00:28:20,223 --> 00:28:21,986
Can you stop that?

303
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:25,855
I'm making pancakes for Mom.
I can't stop. My sister said.

304
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:31,464
Stop it.

305
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:33,461
No.

306
00:28:45,049 --> 00:28:47,040
What are you doing here?

307
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:50,017
You want me to whisk in your face, too?

308
00:28:50,154 --> 00:28:53,612
This is not your house, and
you're not the boss of me.

309
00:29:00,265 --> 00:29:01,425
Come on.

310
00:29:07,239 --> 00:29:09,901
We're making pancakes for
Mom, so she won't be sad.

311
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:12,976
- Our dad's dead.
- He knows. He's his brother.

312
00:29:13,111 --> 00:29:14,510
I know that.

313
00:29:14,646 --> 00:29:17,547
No drinking out of
the carton! It's gross!

314
00:29:19,284 --> 00:29:21,082
Shut up. You're gross.

315
00:29:21,854 --> 00:29:23,845
- No!
- You want a pancake?

316
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:26,015
No, I don't like pancakes.

317
00:29:26,692 --> 00:29:30,355
- Our pancakes are the best.
- Eat your own crap, all right?

318
00:29:31,063 --> 00:29:33,293
Mom! You're supposed to be upstairs.

319
00:29:33,432 --> 00:29:35,525
- What are you doing awake?
- It's a surprise!

320
00:29:35,668 --> 00:29:38,865
I am surprised. Thank you.

321
00:29:39,005 --> 00:29:42,441
The nicest little girls in the world.

322
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,303
Who's that?

323
00:29:48,448 --> 00:29:50,109
- Grandpa!
- Grandpa!

324
00:29:50,884 --> 00:29:52,317
- Hey, babies.
- Hi!

325
00:29:52,452 --> 00:29:55,148
- What have you got in your hair?
- Pancake batter.

326
00:29:55,289 --> 00:29:57,484
- Pancake batter.
- Hi, sweetie.

327
00:29:58,725 --> 00:30:01,558
- Hey, let's go watch TV.
- Come on, girls.

328
00:30:02,296 --> 00:30:04,457
- I'll get the syrup.
- What a mess.

329
00:30:04,631 --> 00:30:07,897
- Bye, Tommy.
- We'll clean this up later.

330
00:30:21,749 --> 00:30:23,080
Morning.

331
00:30:26,387 --> 00:30:27,980
Pancakes, huh?

332
00:30:29,858 --> 00:30:33,225
Yeah, actually there's one
on the floor if you want it.

333
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:45,704
- What are they doing in here?
- They were making pancakes.

334
00:30:52,415 --> 00:30:53,347
Look...

335
00:30:55,251 --> 00:30:58,345
- I was a little stupid the other day.
- Yeah, hey.

336
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:04,120
- I was okay to drive, though.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. I know.

337
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,774
I know Sam was always smarter than me.

338
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:34,923
Well, I don't know about smarter.
He was a damn good athlete.

339
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:40,790
Remember that game against Easton?

340
00:31:40,966 --> 00:31:42,991
Cool as ice.

341
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:52,802
You had some talent,
too, you know. I mean...

342
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:56,544
You just quit all the time.

343
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:59,810
Now, that was the difference
between you and him.

344
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:02,486
Sam had no quit in him.

345
00:32:26,713 --> 00:32:29,546
I'd cut my throat to
bring him back, Dad.

346
00:32:36,924 --> 00:32:38,654
God damn it.

347
00:32:38,793 --> 00:32:43,423
I don't know how she lives
with this kitchen the way it is.

348
00:32:54,409 --> 00:32:56,969
Private, come here. Fucking help me.

349
00:32:57,112 --> 00:32:58,841
I can't see anything.

350
00:33:01,217 --> 00:33:02,707
They're looking for us.

351
00:33:05,054 --> 00:33:06,385
All right.

352
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:28,071
- Should we try again?
- Not right now.

353
00:33:49,367 --> 00:33:52,336
Come on, man. Just put
it where you got it.

354
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:54,097
Grace. Hey.

355
00:33:55,706 --> 00:33:58,106
You remember, A.J., Owen.

356
00:34:02,547 --> 00:34:05,414
Sweeney... I don't
remember your first name.

357
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,916
There's a reason for that.

358
00:34:07,052 --> 00:34:09,247
- It's nice to meet you, Grace.
- You, too.

359
00:34:10,189 --> 00:34:11,713
What's going on?

360
00:34:14,793 --> 00:34:16,886
We're just fixing up
the kitchen for you.

361
00:34:18,497 --> 00:34:19,623
Tommy.

362
00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:25,496
Were you ever going to run this by me?

363
00:34:25,637 --> 00:34:28,105
- Can you believe it? She's gorgeous.
- It's my house.

364
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,708
- Somebody's all growed up.
- It's not funny.

365
00:34:29,876 --> 00:34:33,039
What the hell is wrong
with you guys? She's been...

366
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:35,204
You have to run this by me.

367
00:34:39,886 --> 00:34:41,114
I was...

368
00:34:45,825 --> 00:34:49,317
- Can I get you guys coffee, something?
- No, thanks.

369
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:53,660
- Maybe a beer.
- I would like a beer, too.

370
00:34:54,435 --> 00:34:56,164
Don't tell them anything.

371
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:58,203
Don't you tell them anything, Private.

372
00:34:59,173 --> 00:35:01,164
They're not asking me anything.

373
00:35:02,243 --> 00:35:03,676
They're just starving us.

374
00:35:03,844 --> 00:35:05,436
Stay calm, Private.

375
00:35:06,847 --> 00:35:10,283
- Be present.
- I am fucking present.

376
00:35:10,451 --> 00:35:14,286
I'm fucking present. I've been present
in this shithole for two fucking months.

377
00:35:14,422 --> 00:35:17,858
What the fuck did you save me
for? Why did you come after me?

378
00:35:19,127 --> 00:35:22,290
I should've drowned in that lake.
We'd both be better off dead.

379
00:35:25,033 --> 00:35:26,523
What day is it?

380
00:35:38,848 --> 00:35:40,110
Saturday.

381
00:35:42,518 --> 00:35:44,076
What time is it?

382
00:35:52,061 --> 00:35:53,323
About noon.

383
00:36:24,329 --> 00:36:26,092
You remember what I told you.

384
00:36:26,264 --> 00:36:30,462
No information. You give them nothing.
You give them nothing, Private.

385
00:36:30,601 --> 00:36:31,590
Yeah.

386
00:36:40,946 --> 00:36:43,938
- Where are they taking us?
- Don't speak. Don't speak!

387
00:36:49,254 --> 00:36:52,314
- Are they gonna cut our heads off?
- Not another fucking word!

388
00:37:32,933 --> 00:37:34,127
Welcome.

389
00:37:46,113 --> 00:37:48,344
I used the satellite
phone to call my wife.

390
00:37:49,618 --> 00:37:50,744
She's pregnant.

391
00:37:51,787 --> 00:37:54,813
I jeopardized your
location and your mission.

392
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:57,491
We have the same blood.

393
00:37:59,828 --> 00:38:01,819
Syed is my nephew.

394
00:38:25,888 --> 00:38:27,185
Fuck them.

395
00:38:36,533 --> 00:38:37,830
This is our country.

396
00:38:39,803 --> 00:38:41,634
You should not be here.

397
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:47,900
Tell this message to America.

398
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:50,011
You say it,

399
00:38:52,382 --> 00:38:54,283
or I'll force you to say it.

400
00:39:42,936 --> 00:39:44,597
The girls are back.

401
00:39:45,038 --> 00:39:47,165
It's a good thing downstairs.

402
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:54,910
I'll see you tomorrow.

403
00:39:56,616 --> 00:39:57,878
Thanks, Elsie.

404
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,052
Okay.

405
00:40:06,427 --> 00:40:10,158
- Who is painting the kitchen?
- I am.

406
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,967
Get that spot right there.

407
00:40:14,101 --> 00:40:16,899
You know, your dad was a great
football player in high school.

408
00:40:17,038 --> 00:40:18,403
- Really?
- Yeah.

409
00:40:19,173 --> 00:40:22,143
He was small, but he
was a great quarterback.

410
00:40:23,211 --> 00:40:27,545
Me and A.J. and Owen used to go to
the games just to watch him play.

411
00:40:29,618 --> 00:40:30,949
Did you ever have a
chance to see him play?

412
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:32,020
No.

413
00:40:32,154 --> 00:40:34,714
- Izzie, you're so tall.
- Thanks.

414
00:40:38,293 --> 00:40:41,091
- Good job, Mag.
- Thanks, Mom.

415
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:50,102
Do they need to do their
homework or something?

416
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,503
No. She's having fun.

417
00:40:54,544 --> 00:40:55,738
Get these real good.

418
00:40:57,146 --> 00:40:58,204
Shit the bed!

419
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:03,180
- What are you doing?
- Painting.

420
00:41:07,124 --> 00:41:08,887
These are brand new pants.

421
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,287
- Hey, man...
- I'm sorry.

422
00:41:12,129 --> 00:41:13,494
Chill out, man. She said she was sorry.

423
00:41:13,631 --> 00:41:16,464
It's okay, Maggie. I think I
have something for you, okay?

424
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,692
- Just wait here.
- Do you have a bathroom...

425
00:41:17,835 --> 00:41:20,497
No. Please don't bring
the paint in, okay?

426
00:41:20,638 --> 00:41:23,607
- It's not that bad, man.
- Take it easy, man.

427
00:41:23,741 --> 00:41:26,266
There's almost nothing on
you, man. You look fine.

428
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:29,938
That will come out. I mean, the
real major cleanup is the floor.

429
00:41:30,081 --> 00:41:31,173
You're such a dick.

430
00:41:31,316 --> 00:41:34,012
- Looks like it just grazed you.
- It doesn't look that bad.

431
00:41:37,989 --> 00:41:38,887
You're right.

432
00:41:40,025 --> 00:41:41,253
Let's hug it out.

433
00:41:41,893 --> 00:41:43,155
- Hugs?
- What's he talking about?

434
00:41:43,328 --> 00:41:44,761
- Hugs.
- What?

435
00:41:46,464 --> 00:41:49,457
Stay away from the kid.
Stay away from the kid.

436
00:41:49,635 --> 00:41:51,296
Hey. Hey, hey, hey!

437
00:42:27,741 --> 00:42:29,675
You have a lovely body, Owen.

438
00:42:33,114 --> 00:42:34,103
Fuck me.

439
00:42:35,817 --> 00:42:37,341
Do you work out?

440
00:42:40,988 --> 00:42:42,421
Can I ask you where
you got your underwear?

441
00:42:42,557 --> 00:42:44,388
Because they fit. They
fit perfectly like...

442
00:42:44,992 --> 00:42:46,926
You guys are so fucking funny.

443
00:42:47,095 --> 00:42:49,063
I'm asking you a serious
question, that's all.

444
00:42:49,263 --> 00:42:50,594
These should all fit you.

445
00:42:50,732 --> 00:42:53,758
All I need is a T-shirt and some pants.

446
00:42:53,935 --> 00:42:55,267
Take it all.

447
00:42:55,904 --> 00:42:57,735
I don't need all this.

448
00:43:03,879 --> 00:43:06,404
She didn't have to give me all this.

449
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:09,842
Just take it all, man.

450
00:43:12,087 --> 00:43:14,885
- I don't have to bring it back?
- Jesus. Are you listening? Take the clothes.

451
00:43:15,023 --> 00:43:17,618
- I was just fucking asking.
- Take them.

452
00:43:46,524 --> 00:43:48,856
Do you want to help your friend?

453
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:54,321
Now it's his turn.

454
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:01,402
- Stay strong, Private.
- Yes, sir.

455
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:07,069
Fuck!

456
00:44:09,881 --> 00:44:11,746
Don't give them anything!

457
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:13,644
Private!

458
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:16,954
Your life depends on it!

459
00:44:17,088 --> 00:44:18,020
Please.

460
00:44:22,595 --> 00:44:26,531
Fuck! Motherfuckers! I
will fucking kill you!

461
00:44:28,134 --> 00:44:29,567
Christ!

462
00:44:30,636 --> 00:44:34,595
<i>My name is Private Joe Willis. I'm
with the United States Marine Corps.</i>

463
00:44:34,774 --> 00:44:38,073
I was told I was coming
here to fight for my country.

464
00:44:39,378 --> 00:44:43,280
But now I realize that
Afghanistan belongs to its people.

465
00:44:44,317 --> 00:44:46,684
<i>And we have no business being here.</i>

466
00:44:48,222 --> 00:44:49,951
<i>I love you, Cassie.</i>

467
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:54,225
<i>Joe Jr., your daddy always loves you.</i>

468
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,731
You have two daughters.

469
00:45:05,472 --> 00:45:07,441
Okay. Dad, get down.

470
00:45:07,609 --> 00:45:08,541
- How's this?
- Perfect.

471
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:11,338
- Great. Great.
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

472
00:45:43,445 --> 00:45:45,606
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

473
00:45:46,548 --> 00:45:47,640
Happy birthday!

474
00:45:48,951 --> 00:45:50,943
- You like the kitchen?
- I love it.

475
00:45:51,087 --> 00:45:52,611
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

476
00:45:52,756 --> 00:45:53,688
You're welcome.

477
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:55,885
Mom, this is from Deedee.

478
00:45:56,026 --> 00:45:57,960
- Thank you, Deedee.
- You're welcome.

479
00:45:58,395 --> 00:46:00,761
- Can I help you open it?
- Yes, please.

480
00:46:02,032 --> 00:46:03,260
- She looking now?
- No, she's opening the presents.

481
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,867
Good job on the kitchen.

482
00:46:05,502 --> 00:46:06,526
What did he just say to me?

483
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:08,695
He said you did a good
job on the kitchen.

484
00:46:09,139 --> 00:46:10,071
Okay. Go, go.

485
00:46:30,861 --> 00:46:33,125
Blow out the candles. Come on, come on.

486
00:46:34,933 --> 00:46:36,059
Do it.

487
00:46:42,507 --> 00:46:43,804
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

488
00:46:43,976 --> 00:46:46,536
- Happy birthday, Mama.
- Thank you.

489
00:46:51,783 --> 00:46:53,683
Maggie? Maggie.

490
00:46:54,252 --> 00:46:55,776
- No!
- Maggie, slow down.

491
00:46:55,921 --> 00:46:57,685
Maggie, be careful.

492
00:47:01,828 --> 00:47:02,852
What are you doing?

493
00:47:02,996 --> 00:47:05,055
I want to get to the ice before my mama.

494
00:47:05,198 --> 00:47:07,598
Well, you better wait
for her, don't you think?

495
00:47:08,301 --> 00:47:10,064
Everybody loves Maggie.

496
00:47:11,437 --> 00:47:13,564
- Why do you say that?
- Because she's lovable.

497
00:47:22,082 --> 00:47:23,811
You know, your dad saved me

498
00:47:23,951 --> 00:47:26,419
in that water, right there,
when we were both kids.

499
00:47:28,889 --> 00:47:30,618
You know, you're like your dad.

500
00:47:31,325 --> 00:47:32,383
Am I?

501
00:47:36,563 --> 00:47:38,190
Am I like my mom?

502
00:47:40,234 --> 00:47:42,032
A spitting image, yeah.

503
00:47:43,705 --> 00:47:47,334
Except you're yourself,
Isabelle. And everybody loves you.

504
00:47:48,076 --> 00:47:49,270
Come on.

505
00:48:15,204 --> 00:48:16,432
I did it!

506
00:49:22,207 --> 00:49:24,607
I talked to her for over an hour.

507
00:49:26,411 --> 00:49:30,371
She said to me that she hadn't
slept right in over three years.

508
00:49:31,518 --> 00:49:35,716
She kept having these nightmares
that I would come back and shoot her.

509
00:49:39,592 --> 00:49:40,923
I don't know.

510
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:46,589
I told her it was all right,
that I wasn't gonna hurt her.

511
00:49:48,234 --> 00:49:50,134
She just started to cry.

512
00:49:53,674 --> 00:49:56,643
Right there in the bank,
she just started to cry.

513
00:50:01,348 --> 00:50:03,043
And she thanked me.

514
00:50:07,688 --> 00:50:09,883
She said that she felt like...

515
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:12,949
What did she say?

516
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:17,198
Like she could breathe again.

517
00:50:19,301 --> 00:50:22,464
And then she asked if I wanted
to open up a bank account.

518
00:50:22,604 --> 00:50:23,536
No.

519
00:50:24,139 --> 00:50:25,367
I swear to God.

520
00:50:25,507 --> 00:50:27,566
- What did you do?
- I opened an account.

521
00:50:32,447 --> 00:50:34,005
I'm proud of you.

522
00:50:36,117 --> 00:50:38,552
I can't wait to start bouncing checks.

523
00:50:52,301 --> 00:50:57,034
When I was like 17 or 18,

524
00:51:04,047 --> 00:51:08,541
I used to listen to this song,
like, over and over again.

525
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:09,913
Me, too.

526
00:51:12,556 --> 00:51:13,853
Really?

527
00:51:13,991 --> 00:51:15,925
Why is that so surprising?

528
00:51:18,428 --> 00:51:20,329
I don't know. I just...

529
00:51:23,434 --> 00:51:25,902
I took you more for,
like, an 'NSync fan.

530
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:27,196
Fuck you.

531
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:29,272
Give me that.

532
00:51:29,907 --> 00:51:31,602
- Really?
- Really.

533
00:51:45,257 --> 00:51:47,282
You think I'm such a square.

534
00:51:48,127 --> 00:51:50,459
I'm starting to reassess, Snoop Dogg.

535
00:51:57,102 --> 00:51:59,627
Just because I was a
cheerleader, it doesn't...

536
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,931
Yeah, and you dated a football player.

537
00:52:04,076 --> 00:52:05,738
I am such a cliché.

538
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:14,983
You were kind of a pain in
the ass. You got to admit that.

539
00:52:15,155 --> 00:52:16,782
No, I wasn't.

540
00:52:17,657 --> 00:52:21,115
Guys always say that girls are
stuck up if they won't talk to them.

541
00:52:21,761 --> 00:52:23,592
I just didn't like you.

542
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:26,291
You were always drunk and fighting...

543
00:53:05,474 --> 00:53:07,635
I have to get some air.

544
00:54:57,224 --> 00:54:58,384
Captain!

545
00:55:00,394 --> 00:55:01,759
Captain!

546
00:55:43,739 --> 00:55:44,900
Take it.

547
00:56:05,595 --> 00:56:06,961
What do we do?

548
00:56:09,166 --> 00:56:11,157
He has no value for us.

549
00:56:13,571 --> 00:56:15,732
Just a weight on our shoulder.

550
00:56:18,842 --> 00:56:20,810
Waste of food and water.

551
00:56:23,047 --> 00:56:24,173
Kill him.

552
00:56:45,103 --> 00:56:46,365
Pick it up.

553
00:56:48,907 --> 00:56:50,170
You have family?

554
00:56:53,045 --> 00:56:54,535
Do you want to see them again?

555
00:56:56,182 --> 00:56:58,047
Pick up the pipe!

556
00:57:04,023 --> 00:57:06,048
- Captain...
- It's you or him.

557
00:57:07,526 --> 00:57:09,323
Kill him or I will kill you.

558
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:14,965
Kill him! Kill him or
I will cut his head off!

559
00:57:15,202 --> 00:57:16,601
Kill him! Kill him!

560
00:57:18,805 --> 00:57:19,965
Kill him!

561
00:57:21,875 --> 00:57:22,933
Kill him!

562
00:58:19,235 --> 00:58:20,224
Shit.

563
00:58:32,649 --> 00:58:34,708
I brought you some molding.

564
00:58:50,901 --> 00:58:52,528
Hey, look, I don't want to
ruin anything, all right.

565
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:55,730
I just want to be able to
come over and see the girls.

566
00:58:55,906 --> 00:58:58,704
Please, I would love you
to come see the girls.

567
00:59:03,715 --> 00:59:05,342
We just miss Sam.

568
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:08,977
Yeah.

569
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:15,524
That's Hank.

570
00:59:25,304 --> 00:59:27,067
You still at it, huh?

571
00:59:31,911 --> 00:59:34,539
Where did you ever learn to be so handy?

572
01:00:19,127 --> 01:00:20,219
Cover there!

573
01:00:24,265 --> 01:00:26,324
Move forward. Moving forward!

574
01:00:26,467 --> 01:00:27,764
Come on. Let's go.

575
01:00:31,273 --> 01:00:32,365
Straight ahead!

576
01:00:32,908 --> 01:00:34,375
- Stop right there!
- Get your hands up.

577
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:36,239
Come to me. Come to me.

578
01:00:37,179 --> 01:00:38,771
Come on. Get your hands up.

579
01:00:39,448 --> 01:00:42,110
Get your hands up. Right here. Get down.

580
01:00:46,522 --> 01:00:47,853
You a Marine?

581
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,529
Cahill, is that your name?

582
01:00:53,663 --> 01:00:55,597
Was there anyone else with you?

583
01:00:57,934 --> 01:00:59,526
- Come on. Ready?
- Come on.

584
01:01:04,474 --> 01:01:06,271
Get it on. Get it on.

585
01:01:06,977 --> 01:01:08,239
We need a nose.

586
01:01:08,845 --> 01:01:10,870
- Mom, nose.
- Nose.

587
01:01:11,481 --> 01:01:12,778
- Nose!
- Here.

588
01:01:12,916 --> 01:01:15,112
Get the nose. Get the nose.

589
01:01:17,588 --> 01:01:19,453
He is looking hot, you guys.

590
01:01:21,259 --> 01:01:22,886
Can you teach them
how to throw snowballs?

591
01:01:23,027 --> 01:01:24,688
Because they can't even hit me.

592
01:01:28,532 --> 01:01:29,692
That one hit you.

593
01:01:30,668 --> 01:01:33,193
Maybe I should hit you
with a massive snowball.

594
01:01:34,605 --> 01:01:35,799
Come on.

595
01:01:36,842 --> 01:01:38,139
Izzie, Izzie, are you okay?

596
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:40,404
Izzie, Izzie. Hey, hey, hey.

597
01:01:40,545 --> 01:01:42,445
- Are you okay?
- Grace.

598
01:01:42,614 --> 01:01:45,048
Sucker! Sucker.

599
01:01:45,484 --> 01:01:46,746
Get him! Get him!

600
01:01:50,322 --> 01:01:51,755
Get him. Try and get him.

601
01:01:52,858 --> 01:01:53,882
Hello?

602
01:01:54,927 --> 01:01:56,087
Yes, this is she.

603
01:01:57,629 --> 01:01:59,598
See this cheater-pants over here.

604
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,061
Come on. You freaked me out.

605
01:02:14,247 --> 01:02:16,010
- What?
- Not me.

606
01:02:17,050 --> 01:02:19,245
It was him! Get up.

607
01:02:36,737 --> 01:02:38,602
Hey. What's going on?

608
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:41,805
- Uncle Tommy, she grabbed my hair.
- Okay.

609
01:02:41,942 --> 01:02:44,070
I'm sorry. I want to keep playing.

610
01:02:44,212 --> 01:02:45,406
Okay. What?

611
01:03:01,529 --> 01:03:03,497
- Can I go out?
- Not yet.

612
01:03:03,631 --> 01:03:07,090
- Why?
- Because we have to be patient. Okay?

613
01:03:10,039 --> 01:03:12,473
- Sir.
- Welcome home, Sam.

614
01:03:12,608 --> 01:03:13,734
Thanks.

615
01:03:22,585 --> 01:03:23,813
Daddy!

616
01:03:25,187 --> 01:03:28,055
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you, too.

617
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:30,656
My babies.

618
01:04:03,261 --> 01:04:04,922
I love you, honey.

619
01:04:12,704 --> 01:04:15,571
- Here, let me take your bag.
- Sure.

620
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:26,742
Come on. Come on. Hurry.

621
01:04:27,453 --> 01:04:29,614
Do you like it? Do you like it?

622
01:04:29,788 --> 01:04:32,587
Wow. It's amazing.

623
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:34,586
I think he likes it.

624
01:04:35,829 --> 01:04:37,319
- Who did it?
- Me.

625
01:04:37,497 --> 01:04:39,556
- You did?
- And Uncle Tommy.

626
01:04:39,732 --> 01:04:41,825
Uncle Tommy and 'three amigos'.

627
01:05:08,462 --> 01:05:10,123
Are you tired, honey?

628
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:13,658
Come, get in bed. Everyone.

629
01:05:15,269 --> 01:05:16,703
This is fun.

630
01:05:18,507 --> 01:05:21,067
- I missed you, Daddy.
- Me, too.

631
01:05:21,977 --> 01:05:23,239
My girls.

632
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:26,445
That's us, all right.

633
01:05:38,027 --> 01:05:39,585
Can I get up, Mom?

634
01:05:41,197 --> 01:05:42,994
Dad, it's not bedtime.

635
01:05:57,380 --> 01:05:59,041
I locked that door.

636
01:06:00,617 --> 01:06:01,982
It's broken.

637
01:06:20,704 --> 01:06:22,900
I'm just gonna finish shaving.

638
01:06:52,171 --> 01:06:54,639
- Banged up well, huh?
- Yeah.

639
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:02,809
Can't you take that
down to the mechanic?

640
01:07:05,117 --> 01:07:06,346
I got it.

641
01:07:07,554 --> 01:07:09,181
Nothing else to do.

642
01:07:12,158 --> 01:07:13,352
You okay?

643
01:07:15,128 --> 01:07:16,152
Yeah.

644
01:07:21,835 --> 01:07:28,366
'Cause after I got back from Nam,
I couldn't talk to your mother.

645
01:07:30,945 --> 01:07:35,382
I guess I took it out on
you and Tommy, you know, I...

646
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:37,774
I don't know why.

647
01:07:40,454 --> 01:07:45,414
Look, if you ever wanna
talk, let me know. All right?

648
01:08:10,585 --> 01:08:11,677
You okay?

649
01:08:15,692 --> 01:08:17,023
You're good.

650
01:08:18,528 --> 01:08:20,587
Better than I thought, yeah.

651
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,566
You look good out there with them.

652
01:08:33,844 --> 01:08:36,074
Thanks for taking care of them.

653
01:08:36,947 --> 01:08:38,312
I didn't expect that.

654
01:08:38,449 --> 01:08:40,815
It just comes naturally, you know.

655
01:08:46,123 --> 01:08:48,648
It makes me start to think, you know.

656
01:08:56,835 --> 01:08:58,735
Grace is something, huh?

657
01:09:02,674 --> 01:09:04,198
Did you fuck her?

658
01:09:07,479 --> 01:09:08,104
What? You kidding?

659
01:09:10,882 --> 01:09:12,349
I'd understand.

660
01:09:14,819 --> 01:09:17,185
- You thought I was dead.
- Stop it.

661
01:09:18,824 --> 01:09:20,086
Tommy,

662
01:09:21,627 --> 01:09:22,821
I could forgive you.

663
01:09:33,406 --> 01:09:35,499
What's going on in your head?

664
01:09:37,143 --> 01:09:39,270
What's making you think that?

665
01:09:43,517 --> 01:09:48,079
You guys just look like two
teenagers in love out there.

666
01:09:49,856 --> 01:09:51,118
All right.

667
01:09:52,259 --> 01:09:53,954
I mean, you know?

668
01:09:55,195 --> 01:09:56,890
You can't deny that.

669
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:14,304
You can tell me.

670
01:10:15,983 --> 01:10:17,848
You gotta tell me. You understand?

671
01:10:18,886 --> 01:10:21,150
- I know you slept in my house.
- Sam. Sam...

672
01:10:21,289 --> 01:10:24,225
Hey, don't bullshit me.

673
01:10:41,343 --> 01:10:43,038
Joe Jr., come back.

674
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,473
Cassie, he's fine.

675
01:10:48,384 --> 01:10:51,876
Ever since his dad died, I
can't let him out of my sight.

676
01:10:52,989 --> 01:10:55,651
Look at him. He's got a mind of his own.

677
01:10:56,659 --> 01:11:00,720
I have this nightmare where
Joe is looking up at me,

678
01:11:01,598 --> 01:11:02,860
and he's trying to tell me something.

679
01:11:02,999 --> 01:11:05,797
He's trying to talk
to me, but the teeth,

680
01:11:05,935 --> 01:11:09,804
his teeth just fall out of
his mouth and there is blood,

681
01:11:12,009 --> 01:11:15,342
and I'm scrabbling
around picking them up.

682
01:11:16,614 --> 01:11:19,981
And then last night,
your husband was there.

683
01:11:21,418 --> 01:11:23,113
And he looks at my hand,
and he takes my hand,

684
01:11:23,254 --> 01:11:25,688
and he looks at my wedding
ring and he just smiles at me.

685
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:30,090
- Did he say anything?
- No. He just smiled.

686
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:37,664
In the dream, I hated
him for being alive.

687
01:11:39,271 --> 01:11:42,297
That's why I came over
to apologize. I'm sorry.

688
01:11:43,708 --> 01:11:47,804
I'm sick of feeling like this all
the time. I want to forgive them.

689
01:11:47,979 --> 01:11:50,345
I want to be able to forgive them.

690
01:11:55,388 --> 01:11:56,719
Poor Joe Jr.

691
01:11:58,291 --> 01:11:59,417
He knows.

692
01:12:00,626 --> 01:12:04,357
He's just like his daddy. He
knows exactly what I'm thinking.

693
01:12:10,369 --> 01:12:12,269
Where are you going, huh?

694
01:12:15,709 --> 01:12:17,233
- Sam.
- Hi.

695
01:12:19,413 --> 01:12:21,142
Did you see him die?

696
01:12:25,118 --> 01:12:26,050
No.

697
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:28,917
Did you hear anything?

698
01:12:29,890 --> 01:12:31,858
I mean, was he on his own?

699
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:35,687
He was brave. I know that.

700
01:12:38,533 --> 01:12:40,364
That's Captain Cahill.

701
01:12:41,302 --> 01:12:43,702
He was friends with your daddy.

702
01:12:43,838 --> 01:12:47,171
Wave. Are you gonna
wave? Are you gonna wave?

703
01:12:49,177 --> 01:12:50,735
You're a good man.

704
01:12:51,813 --> 01:12:54,407
Baby, where are you going? Come here.

705
01:14:26,813 --> 01:14:29,646
- Sir, Captain Cahill.
- Send him in.

706
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:32,881
I want to go back, sir.

707
01:14:33,986 --> 01:14:36,113
I'm ready. Need to see my men.

708
01:14:37,290 --> 01:14:39,315
How's the counseling going?

709
01:14:39,759 --> 01:14:41,488
Yeah. I saw Thompson.

710
01:14:42,729 --> 01:14:47,929
Everything pretty good there and,
you know, just thinking about my men

711
01:14:48,068 --> 01:14:51,094
and want to get back.

712
01:14:51,238 --> 01:14:52,535
That's good.

713
01:14:54,007 --> 01:14:55,634
How's the family?

714
01:14:59,246 --> 01:15:01,077
I can't be there, sir.

715
01:15:01,615 --> 01:15:02,639
Yeah?

716
01:15:04,685 --> 01:15:06,482
They don't understand.

717
01:15:08,989 --> 01:15:11,481
You know, I mean, nobody understands.

718
01:15:13,595 --> 01:15:16,029
It's gonna take a little time, Sam.

719
01:15:17,031 --> 01:15:18,896
You've been through a lot of shit.

720
01:15:20,435 --> 01:15:22,335
So has your family.

721
01:15:22,470 --> 01:15:24,131
I don't mind Brian.

722
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:29,006
He never hits people, only
the boys, but not the girls.

723
01:15:29,144 --> 01:15:30,839
- That is nice.
- Yeah.

724
01:15:31,446 --> 01:15:35,850
And he has a dog with really big ears.
I can't remember his name, though.

725
01:15:36,018 --> 01:15:37,212
Elephant?

726
01:15:41,757 --> 01:15:43,486
An elephant's not a dog.

727
01:15:43,893 --> 01:15:46,088
I know an elephant's not a dog.

728
01:15:46,228 --> 01:15:47,490
Then why did you say it?

729
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:51,896
Because elephants have big
ears and so does his dog.

730
01:15:52,034 --> 01:15:57,530
So, big ears, get it?

731
01:15:58,008 --> 01:16:00,670
It's really funny if
you think about it, Dad.

732
01:16:00,911 --> 01:16:01,969
Sam, relax.

733
01:16:02,112 --> 01:16:03,807
But how is it funny?

734
01:16:04,881 --> 01:16:06,075
Big ears.

735
01:16:20,965 --> 01:16:26,028
- Is Dad okay, Mom?
- Yeah. Of course. Of course.

736
01:16:27,805 --> 01:16:29,432
When is Uncle Tommy coming?

737
01:16:29,574 --> 01:16:31,439
- He's coming soon, sweetie, okay?
- Okay.

738
01:16:31,576 --> 01:16:33,544
He wants to play with you.

739
01:16:34,745 --> 01:16:36,076
- Okay?
- Okay.

740
01:16:36,647 --> 01:16:39,708
- I'm gonna go check on Daddy, okay?
- Okay.

741
01:16:52,998 --> 01:16:54,727
Sammy, what happened?

742
01:16:56,034 --> 01:16:57,592
What's going on?

743
01:16:58,670 --> 01:17:00,002
Talk to me.

744
01:17:01,841 --> 01:17:03,274
What happened?

745
01:17:04,911 --> 01:17:06,811
What did they do to you?

746
01:17:08,848 --> 01:17:11,146
What happened with you and Tommy?

747
01:17:24,765 --> 01:17:26,494
We kissed. That's it.

748
01:17:29,403 --> 01:17:30,802
I missed you.

749
01:17:31,972 --> 01:17:33,872
I thought you were dead.

750
01:17:35,409 --> 01:17:37,377
I couldn't get out of bed.

751
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,577
That's it.

752
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:52,351
- You told me the truth?
- You know.

753
01:17:58,166 --> 01:17:59,497
Now tell me.

754
01:18:18,087 --> 01:18:20,214
I think you're fucking Tommy.

755
01:18:21,023 --> 01:18:22,149
Sam...

756
01:19:10,108 --> 01:19:12,805
Come on, come on. Faster. Faster.

757
01:19:16,315 --> 01:19:17,805
Why did you stop pulling?

758
01:19:20,386 --> 01:19:21,375
Hey.

759
01:19:23,355 --> 01:19:24,947
You girls playing?

760
01:19:29,962 --> 01:19:31,395
What's wrong?

761
01:19:38,138 --> 01:19:39,400
It's okay.

762
01:19:44,344 --> 01:19:46,039
I was just confused.

763
01:19:49,282 --> 01:19:50,943
It's gonna be okay.

764
01:19:52,419 --> 01:19:55,081
Come here. Give me a hug.

765
01:19:56,323 --> 01:20:00,020
Now. Those are my girls.

766
01:20:08,135 --> 01:20:11,536
Why did the girl blush when
she opened the refrigerator?

767
01:20:11,705 --> 01:20:15,197
- She saw the salad dressing.
- She saw the salad dressing.

768
01:20:15,743 --> 01:20:17,108
I told you guys that one?

769
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,072
A thousand times.

770
01:20:20,215 --> 01:20:22,149
It's still funny, though.

771
01:20:27,222 --> 01:20:27,449
Have fun.

772
01:20:53,683 --> 01:20:55,378
Where have you been?

773
01:20:55,751 --> 01:20:59,517
I was outside

774
01:21:00,656 --> 01:21:07,119
just thinking and...

775
01:21:14,638 --> 01:21:18,096
I was just thinking
about you and the kids

776
01:21:18,275 --> 01:21:23,144
and the sun came up and I thought,

777
01:21:25,116 --> 01:21:27,050
I'm so lucky to be alive.

778
01:21:48,207 --> 01:21:51,005
We're gonna be late. Come on.

779
01:21:51,143 --> 01:21:52,576
Do you have a spelling test today?

780
01:21:52,711 --> 01:21:56,545
Come on, Grandpa. It's my
birthday. It's my birthday!

781
01:22:01,487 --> 01:22:04,354
Can I open my presents now? Please.

782
01:22:04,490 --> 01:22:06,082
I think we should wait.

783
01:22:06,225 --> 01:22:07,249
Wait for Uncle Tommy.

784
01:22:07,393 --> 01:22:12,024
- Pretty please.
- Well, let her open just one. It won't hurt.

785
01:22:12,632 --> 01:22:15,760
- You can open Grandpa's.
- Thank you.

786
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:17,198
Just one.

787
01:22:17,370 --> 01:22:19,634
- Okay, Mom.
- Let me show you which it is.

788
01:22:19,806 --> 01:22:21,364
Is it the big one?

789
01:22:22,342 --> 01:22:23,366
It's Uncle Tommy!

790
01:22:23,543 --> 01:22:24,567
Let's guess.

791
01:22:31,185 --> 01:22:32,209
Izzie.

792
01:22:32,353 --> 01:22:33,650
- Hey.
- Hey.

793
01:22:36,357 --> 01:22:37,949
What's the matter?

794
01:22:39,293 --> 01:22:40,817
Is she okay?

795
01:22:41,596 --> 01:22:44,429
- Hi.
- Grace, this is Tina.

796
01:22:44,565 --> 01:22:45,964
- I'm Tina.
- Nice to meet you.

797
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:48,000
- Nice to meet you.
- This is my brother's wife, Grace.

798
01:22:48,135 --> 01:22:50,262
We're all in the dining room.

799
01:22:52,407 --> 01:22:54,898
Oh, my God. She's so pretty.

800
01:23:04,486 --> 01:23:06,010
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

801
01:23:06,822 --> 01:23:08,255
This is Tina.

802
01:23:10,058 --> 01:23:11,787
She's an old friend.

803
01:23:12,761 --> 01:23:15,788
Actually, we just met an hour ago.

804
01:23:16,766 --> 01:23:19,257
Yeah. It was like an hour and a half.

805
01:23:20,336 --> 01:23:22,497
You got quite a charmer here.

806
01:23:23,940 --> 01:23:27,068
It hides inside its shell

807
01:23:27,243 --> 01:23:31,805
putting its head in the
shell and its arms and legs

808
01:23:32,782 --> 01:23:34,716
and its little tiny tail.

809
01:23:35,285 --> 01:23:38,847
And when the thing that's
scaring him goes like this,

810
01:23:39,990 --> 01:23:41,855
the turtle doesn't come out.

811
01:23:41,992 --> 01:23:47,123
So, the thing that scares
the turtle goes away

812
01:23:47,264 --> 01:23:49,027
'cause it thinks it's a rock.

813
01:23:49,166 --> 01:23:50,963
- You are a smart girl.
- Happy birthday.

814
01:23:51,101 --> 01:23:52,500
Yes, you are.

815
01:23:55,406 --> 01:23:57,967
- Be careful.
- Everyone needs some reassurance.

816
01:23:58,143 --> 01:23:59,633
Everyone's different, Dad, you know.

817
01:23:59,811 --> 01:24:01,836
- Stop playing with your cake.
- What do you mean?

818
01:24:02,013 --> 01:24:07,280
I just think it's necessary that
everybody has someone to listen to them.

819
01:24:07,419 --> 01:24:11,913
Right, you know, these days they
need therapy if they stub their toe.

820
01:24:12,557 --> 01:24:15,549
These guys are Marines.
They're trained for it.

821
01:24:16,361 --> 01:24:19,559
They're Marines, but
they're still people,

822
01:24:19,699 --> 01:24:25,604
and I don't think that anybody
is trained to shoot somebody.

823
01:24:25,738 --> 01:24:26,898
What do you think they are trained for?

824
01:24:27,039 --> 01:24:32,033
I think that they're... What?
They're trained to use deadly force...

825
01:24:32,478 --> 01:24:34,446
- Trained to kill. ...but
nobody can really be trained

826
01:24:34,613 --> 01:24:35,978
to watch someone die.

827
01:24:36,115 --> 01:24:39,812
That's just something
that you're not taught.

828
01:24:39,952 --> 01:24:40,941
Hey.

829
01:24:44,057 --> 01:24:47,993
Isabelle, let it go.

830
01:24:48,128 --> 01:24:49,959
Please. Thank you.

831
01:24:50,964 --> 01:24:52,625
So, what do you do?

832
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:56,294
- I'm going to be a nurse.
- Hey!

833
01:24:56,436 --> 01:24:59,405
- I'm in nursing school.
- Give it. Give it.

834
01:24:59,539 --> 01:25:01,336
- Dad?
- Isabelle.

835
01:25:02,609 --> 01:25:04,134
That's my kitty.

836
01:25:04,312 --> 01:25:06,712
- You're a nurse?
- I'm a nurse, sir.

837
01:25:07,415 --> 01:25:09,849
- Need a nurse?
- Let you know if I do.

838
01:25:09,984 --> 01:25:11,815
Maggie gets everything.

839
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:15,521
- She got the best doll.
- It's her birthday, honey.

840
01:25:15,656 --> 01:25:18,784
I didn't get anything that
I wanted on my birthday.

841
01:25:20,194 --> 01:25:22,628
And you were in stupid Afghanistan.

842
01:25:27,970 --> 01:25:30,438
Nursing. How's nursing
been for you, Tina?

843
01:25:30,572 --> 01:25:32,369
It's been a challenge.

844
01:25:32,875 --> 01:25:36,436
My stepfather actually encouraged me.

845
01:25:37,513 --> 01:25:39,174
Where did you grow up, Tina?

846
01:25:39,782 --> 01:25:43,183
Just 20 miles south. Actually,
I've never really left.

847
01:25:43,352 --> 01:25:45,980
So... I'm gonna change that, though.

848
01:25:46,355 --> 01:25:48,153
I'm living at home right now which...

849
01:25:48,291 --> 01:25:51,727
It's kind of my home because nobody
else is really there most of the time,

850
01:25:53,363 --> 01:25:57,026
which is good, it helps me
save money for school and stuff.

851
01:25:57,167 --> 01:25:59,499
- RN?
- An RN, yeah.

852
01:26:00,970 --> 01:26:03,632
I have another year to go,
but hopefully my grades...

853
01:26:03,773 --> 01:26:05,832
Isabelle, we're trying to
listen to our guest, all right?

854
01:26:05,975 --> 01:26:08,000
So you're in eight-hour
shifts, 12-hour...

855
01:26:08,144 --> 01:26:12,980
Now I am praying for 12-hour
shifts. I have to get...

856
01:26:13,117 --> 01:26:15,950
Student loans are killing me.

857
01:26:16,454 --> 01:26:18,684
I don't know how anyone
does it. How did you do it?

858
01:26:18,823 --> 01:26:20,017
Isabelle.

859
01:26:24,195 --> 01:26:25,253
Stop it.

860
01:26:25,396 --> 01:26:27,159
What got you into it?

861
01:26:27,665 --> 01:26:31,693
I genuinely like people and I love...

862
01:26:32,003 --> 01:26:34,096
I might as well like it.

863
01:26:34,272 --> 01:26:35,364
Enough!

864
01:26:37,375 --> 01:26:39,536
Couldn't you just stay dead?

865
01:26:39,678 --> 01:26:40,645
Isabelle!

866
01:26:40,779 --> 01:26:43,714
You're just mad 'cause Mom would
rather sleep with Uncle Tommy than you.

867
01:26:43,882 --> 01:26:45,782
Isabelle! Why would you say that?

868
01:26:45,917 --> 01:26:48,215
Mom and Uncle Tommy
had sex all the time.

869
01:26:48,353 --> 01:26:49,479
Enough!

870
01:27:16,250 --> 01:27:17,842
Can I go home now?

871
01:27:19,152 --> 01:27:20,744
I wanna go to bed.

872
01:27:40,875 --> 01:27:42,206
Sorry, Mom.

873
01:27:49,050 --> 01:27:51,917
Why did you say that?
You know it's not true.

874
01:27:55,223 --> 01:27:56,781
I don't like Dad.

875
01:27:59,327 --> 01:28:03,560
I'd rather have Uncle
Tommy around instead of Dad.

876
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:06,360
Me, too.

877
01:28:10,272 --> 01:28:12,433
Daddy's gonna be better, okay?

878
01:28:13,842 --> 01:28:16,003
- Really?
- Yeah.

879
01:28:18,781 --> 01:28:20,112
Thanks, Mom.

880
01:28:23,687 --> 01:28:27,248
- Mom, I love you.
- I love you, baby.

881
01:28:52,149 --> 01:28:55,380
Elsie, I don't know what he's gonna do.

882
01:28:58,789 --> 01:29:00,450
Where are you going?

883
01:29:03,127 --> 01:29:05,118
It's none of your damn
business, you know.

884
01:29:07,599 --> 01:29:09,794
Just stay the hell out of it.

885
01:29:11,203 --> 01:29:13,262
You gotta call the police, Hank.

886
01:29:24,916 --> 01:29:26,349
What is that?

887
01:29:30,356 --> 01:29:32,950
- Where are the kids?
- In bed.

888
01:29:36,362 --> 01:29:38,296
- They all tucked in?
- Yeah.

889
01:29:40,366 --> 01:29:41,958
Say their prayers?

890
01:29:45,104 --> 01:29:46,036
Good.

891
01:29:51,045 --> 01:29:52,069
Sam?

892
01:29:53,714 --> 01:29:54,703
Sam?

893
01:29:57,117 --> 01:29:59,551
What am I supposed to do now, Grace?

894
01:30:20,575 --> 01:30:24,875
- You know what I did to get back to you?
- No.

895
01:30:25,013 --> 01:30:28,471
You know what I did to
fucking get back to you?

896
01:30:28,983 --> 01:30:31,042
You fucking bitch!

897
01:30:33,254 --> 01:30:35,587
You know how he fucking suffered?

898
01:30:35,725 --> 01:30:38,057
He fucking suffered because of you!

899
01:30:38,227 --> 01:30:42,630
And what have you done to my fucking
house and my fucking kids, Grace?

900
01:30:42,798 --> 01:30:45,130
- You're fucking my brother.
- Sam, you know I didn't.

901
01:30:45,367 --> 01:30:48,131
You're fucking my brother
in my fucking house!

902
01:30:48,270 --> 01:30:50,033
- Sam, please.
- I love you, Grace!

903
01:30:50,172 --> 01:30:53,141
- Please, our girls, please.
- You know how much I love you?

904
01:30:54,076 --> 01:30:58,446
You know what I... Grace,
do you know what I fucking...

905
01:30:59,316 --> 01:31:03,218
You know what I had to do with
these fucking hands, Grace?

906
01:31:03,653 --> 01:31:05,553
You... Fuck!

907
01:31:08,792 --> 01:31:10,987
God, fuck!

908
01:31:15,132 --> 01:31:17,032
What are you doing here?

909
01:31:32,583 --> 01:31:33,811
Come on, man.

910
01:31:49,968 --> 01:31:54,200
- Hey. Hey. Hey, hey.
- What are you fucking doing?

911
01:31:54,339 --> 01:31:55,431
Go to your room.

912
01:31:55,574 --> 01:31:57,599
- Fuck. What are you doing, Tommy?
- Okay.

913
01:31:57,743 --> 01:32:00,439
- What the fuck are you doing to me?
- Girls, lock the door.

914
01:32:00,579 --> 01:32:02,480
Behind my fucking back!

915
01:32:04,384 --> 01:32:06,284
- Did you call the cops?
- Hold on.

916
01:32:06,419 --> 01:32:09,183
- Did you call the fucking cops?
- All right. All right. All right.

917
01:32:23,169 --> 01:32:25,035
Is there a disturbance?

918
01:32:28,742 --> 01:32:30,141
Hold back.

919
01:32:30,277 --> 01:32:31,539
What are you doing here?

920
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:33,169
- Drop your weapon.
- What are you doing?

921
01:32:33,314 --> 01:32:36,112
- Hold on. Put your gun down.
- Tommy, go back in the house.

922
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:39,447
- What are you doing, huh?
- Put your weapon down, Captain.

923
01:32:39,587 --> 01:32:40,519
You know me?

924
01:32:40,654 --> 01:32:41,916
- Just shut up for a second, okay?
- You know me, huh?

925
01:32:42,056 --> 01:32:44,251
- I know your father, sir.
- Stay back!

926
01:32:44,391 --> 01:32:46,622
- Stay back!
- All right. All right. All right.

927
01:32:46,761 --> 01:32:49,252
- You're a war hero, sir.
- I'm no fucking hero!

928
01:32:49,397 --> 01:32:51,865
I'm no fucking hero!
You know what I've done?

929
01:32:52,033 --> 01:32:54,331
- Hey, it's all right. Sam!
- Just relax.

930
01:32:54,469 --> 01:32:55,595
- Sam!
- Put the gun down, Sam.

931
01:32:55,770 --> 01:32:57,761
- Put the gun down.
- What are you gonna do?

932
01:32:57,939 --> 01:32:59,236
You gonna shoot me?

933
01:32:59,374 --> 01:33:00,602
- Put the gun down!
- Sam!

934
01:33:00,742 --> 01:33:03,506
- Fucking shoot me! Shoot me!
- Hold your fire. Nobody shoot!

935
01:33:03,645 --> 01:33:05,169
Shoot me! Come on!

936
01:33:05,313 --> 01:33:09,148
Jesus, shut the fuck up! This
is a family matter. Shut up!

937
01:33:09,285 --> 01:33:10,684
Shut up. He's my brother.

938
01:33:10,820 --> 01:33:12,378
- Just stop for a second.
- Put the gun down, sir.

939
01:33:12,521 --> 01:33:15,513
- Just let me talk to him. He's my brother.
- Give him a minute.

940
01:33:21,063 --> 01:33:23,395
- Sam!
- You are my brother, Sam!

941
01:33:25,368 --> 01:33:26,357
Sam!

942
01:33:35,946 --> 01:33:40,144
You're my brother. You're my family.

943
01:33:44,488 --> 01:33:45,955
Do you hear me?

944
01:33:48,592 --> 01:33:49,786
Sam!

945
01:34:07,612 --> 01:34:09,409
What's going on, Sam?

946
01:34:11,549 --> 01:34:13,245
I'm drowning, Tommy.

947
01:34:19,658 --> 01:34:21,683
Go. Go, go. Get on the ground!

948
01:34:22,127 --> 01:34:23,890
- Gun clear. Get down.
- Get on the ground now!

949
01:34:24,029 --> 01:34:25,223
Get down!

950
01:34:25,364 --> 01:34:27,332
- Give me your hand.
- Give me your hand.

951
01:34:29,969 --> 01:34:32,130
On your knees. On your knees.

952
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:36,138
Get him up.

953
01:36:15,746 --> 01:36:17,338
<i>My darling Grace,</i>

954
01:36:19,283 --> 01:36:23,652
<i>if you're reading this, it
means I didn't make it back.</i>

955
01:36:25,857 --> 01:36:28,121
<i>Nothing is certain in this life.</i>

956
01:36:29,961 --> 01:36:35,399
<i>The only thing I know for sure
is that I love you and our girls.</i>

957
01:36:37,769 --> 01:36:39,896
<i>That is the only thing I know.</i>

958
01:36:49,381 --> 01:36:53,283
- Hello?
- Hey, Tommy. It's Sam.

959
01:36:53,919 --> 01:36:54,943
Hey.

960
01:36:59,625 --> 01:37:05,029
I was just thinking about you.

961
01:37:06,132 --> 01:37:09,158
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'm good.

962
01:37:10,170 --> 01:37:13,333
Just calling. Yeah.

963
01:37:17,978 --> 01:37:19,912
You're my brother, Tommy.

964
01:37:34,195 --> 01:37:36,663
When is your birthday, Uncle Tommy?

965
01:37:59,621 --> 01:38:02,954
Okay, sir. You know the drill.
We'll see you in about 30 minutes.

966
01:38:36,059 --> 01:38:37,789
Sam, tell me what happened.

967
01:38:46,003 --> 01:38:50,303
Sam, what happened?

968
01:38:54,111 --> 01:38:56,375
Why are you punishing yourself?

969
01:39:11,396 --> 01:39:14,058
I've loved you since I was 16 years old.

970
01:39:15,066 --> 01:39:16,499
You know that?

971
01:39:16,968 --> 01:39:20,961
If you don't tell me what happened,
you're not gonna see me again.

972
01:39:45,999 --> 01:39:47,398
I killed him.

973
01:39:54,741 --> 01:39:56,436
I killed Joe Willis.

974
01:40:09,791 --> 01:40:13,693
<i>I don't know who said, "Only the
dead have seen the end of war."</i>

975
01:40:16,097 --> 01:40:18,122
<i>I have seen the end of war.</i>

976
01:40:20,835 --> 01:40:26,296
<i>The question is, can I live again?</i>

977
01:40:27,305 --> 01:40:33,160
