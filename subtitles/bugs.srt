1
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:04,202
Bugs. They fascinate us.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:05,437
They frighten us.

3
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:06,938
Some are as big as dinner plates,

4
00:00:07,106 --> 00:00:08,974
others as dangerous as the plague.

5
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:10,976
And I love'em!

6
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:13,278
G'day. I'm Ruud Kleinpaste, the Bugman.

7
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:15,347
And the opportunity
to go looking for bugs...

8
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:18,684
...as big as bugs can get and
as bad as bugs can get...

9
00:00:18,851 --> 00:00:21,253
...was an opportunity
too good to miss.

10
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,388
Aah, he got me! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

11
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:26,525
I'll do whatever it takes
to get down to bugs' level...

12
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,261
...so I can understand
why some bugs become so big...

13
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,531
...and others turn so bad...

14
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:33,832
...on world's Biggest and Baddest Bugs.

15

Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

16
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:45,177
I begin with a journey
in search of the world's biggest bugs.

17
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:48,313
I'm going to need all my experience
as an entomologist...

18
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:52,451
...if I'm to uncover their secret
hiding places, avoid danger,

19
00:00:52,618 --> 00:00:56,054
and discover why some bugs
can get to be as long as your arm...

20
00:00:56,222 --> 00:01:00,192
...and the very biggest can be
the size of a small cat.

21
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,862
First up, the biggest cockroach
in the world.

22
00:01:16,275 --> 00:01:17,376
Ugh!

23
00:01:17,543 --> 00:01:18,477
Oh!

24
00:01:18,644 --> 00:01:21,046
This is what we always think of
as giant bugs.

25
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:22,047
Yuh!

26
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,449
You know, there's monsters
that lurk under the floorboards...

27
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:26,651
and in your kitchen cupboards.

28
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:28,053
Ugh.

29
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:30,489
These ain't no giants.

30
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,560
These are giants.

31
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:36,695
But don't worry.

32
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:37,963
You're not going to find these

33
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:40,699
anywhere near your kitchen cupboard.

34
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,135
This is where they occur.

35
00:01:43,302 --> 00:01:47,272
My search for giants brings me
to the Australian outback.

36
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,207
You got to be tough to live out here.

37
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,343
Whew! It's hot.

38
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,812
Ah. Now. Ah, ah.

39
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,347
Come over here.

40
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,082
See this?

41
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,818
There's some dry soil here

42
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:02,320
sort of, like, recently excavated.

43
00:02:02,488 --> 00:02:06,425
What I'm looking for is
the giant burrowing cockroach.

44
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,062
Most cockroaches are too easy to find.

45
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,330
These giants aren't.

46
00:02:12,498 --> 00:02:16,802
They live only in Queensland
and only in burrows.

47
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:19,771
See? Oh ho ho!

48
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:21,406
Oh, come on. Don't be...

49
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:23,475
Oh, don't be a spoilsport!

50
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,844
I got him. Got him, got him, got him.

51
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:28,713
Righto. Now, there we are.

52
00:02:29,515 --> 00:02:31,583
Ow. Spiky legs, all right.

53
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:34,419
That is what I call a cockroach.

54
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:36,855
Look at it. Might not even be full-grown.

55
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:38,824
And by the looks of it, it's a male.

56
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:40,425
It's a boy.

57
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:41,660
Ohh.

58
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,329
How long? About 3 inches.

59
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,631
See this little lip here?

60
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,367
That means it's a male, and it can dig.

61
00:02:49,535 --> 00:02:50,869
It's like having your hat like this

62
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:54,639
and dig out with your thorax -
your prothorax.

63
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:56,074
Isn't that gorgeous?

64
00:02:57,143 --> 00:03:00,212
These cockroaches don't come
to town, thank goodness.

65
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:01,947
They're strictly country cousins,

66
00:03:02,114 --> 00:03:03,815
and they burrow.

67
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:06,351
They can burrow through
tightly compacted soil

68
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,920
like mini excavators.

69
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:13,191
Now, underneath is the head.
It's always protected.

70
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,993
And you know what?

71
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:19,564
It feels nice and cool,
and it feels nice and moist.

72
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:22,100
And that is a dead giveaway

73
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:25,103
why these cockroaches live underground.

74
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:29,107
Compared to the 90-plus-degrees
heat outside,

75
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:32,244
their burrows are as cool as wine cellars.

76
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:35,413
And like a good wine,
giant cockroaches age well.

77
00:03:35,581 --> 00:03:37,983
They live for up to 10 years.

78
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,520
The roach in your kitchen lives
only for two.

79
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:44,623
Even more remarkable

80
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,260
is that mother giant roaches
give birth to live young.

81
00:03:48,427 --> 00:03:51,196
Now, this is very unusual for cockroaches.

82
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:52,464
Others lay eggs.

83
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:56,301
And she looks after her young
for up to nine months.

84
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:01,940
But why do these junior roaches
grow up to be giants?

85
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:05,477
Well, it's a mystery, but scientists think

86
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,812
it could have something to do with moisture.

87
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:17,822
The biggest cockroaches are found
where more rain falls.

88
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,759
When it rains, they all
come out of their burrows

89
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:24,162
to meet, to mate, and to move on.

90
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:27,532
This is the only time
when they won't dry out

91
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,936
in the fierce Australian heat.

92
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,571
So the moment it rains, they come out,

93
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:34,706
they gather up all these leaves
from around here -

94
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:37,208
eucalyptus leaves and
anything they can find -

95
00:04:37,376 --> 00:04:38,743
and take them down in the burrow.

96
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:41,947
And these leaves are dead,
old, dried leaves.

97
00:04:42,114 --> 00:04:44,616
Mmh. Mmh.

98
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:45,984
Dry?

99
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:51,523
They taste like dead, old, dried leaves.

100
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:53,091
Not something that I could live on,

101
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,193
but these roaches can.

102
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:57,996
This guy has had a heck of a day today.

103
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:00,565
Exciting, mind you, but in the process,

104
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,801
we've destroyed its burrow totally.

105
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,770
Now, luckily, I've found
a burrow here that's deserted.

106
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:08,273
You can always tell a deserted burrow
because it's open.

107
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,874
It's never closed off.

108
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:12,911
So I'm gonna let him go here.
Successful relocation.

109
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,013
Ah, put a leaf in for good measure,
for some food.

110
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:16,014
Away you go.

111
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:20,285
Giant cockroaches are big,
but I've only just begun my search.

112
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,921
And the next bug helps answer the question,

113
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:26,024
"Why aren't bugs as big as buses?"

114
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:44,709
Dragonflies.

115
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:48,013
I love them because they're so ancient.

116
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,650
They were flying around
300 million years ago.

117
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:53,818
That's the time when coal was deposited.

118
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:54,886
Can you imagine?

119
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:56,988
Another thing I like about dragonflies

120
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:59,691
is that they used to be
much larger than this.

121
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,026
Oh, yeah, once they were

122
00:06:01,193 --> 00:06:03,561
the largest flying insect in the world.

123
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:07,565
Now, of course, this is a much smaller
21 st-century model.

124
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:11,336
It's the hawker dragonfly.
A robust little fellow.

125
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:12,771
But I'd like you to meet

126
00:06:12,938 --> 00:06:18,243
a long and slender cousin of this one
the helicopter damselfly.

127
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:23,648
The very first flying insects appeared
about 350 million years ago.

128
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:26,985
There were giant dragonflies
the size of eagles

129
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,521
and damselflies the size of hawks.

130
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,824
So, what happened? Why did they shrink?

131
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:37,362
My journey to find out begins in Panama.

132
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:44,300
Near water should be the perfect place
to find the giant helicopter damselfly.

133
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:50,041
They gather around fallen logs

134
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:53,945
because logs have holes
that will fill up with water,

135
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:58,516
and females come to
these tiny pools to lay eggs.

136
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:03,455
And where there are females,
there are big males.

137
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,994
Males are superb fliers.

138
00:07:10,162 --> 00:07:13,665
They hover over their ponds
like mini helicopters.

139
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,602
And if they receive unwelcome visitors,

140
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,206
they become attack helicopters.

141
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,749
Got him!

142
00:07:33,185 --> 00:07:35,653
Why do they get so big? Well, very simple.

143
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:38,456
Areas like this and habitats
like these tree trunks

144
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,893
don't come around very often,
and they are worth fighting for.

145
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:43,461
So if you're a big male,

146
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,730
you got a better chance of securing a female

147
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,899
with such a piece of real estate.

148
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:49,501
Believe it or not,

149
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:52,270
these helicopters are
the biggest in the world.

150
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:54,172
Body length - around 4 inches.

151
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,508
Wingspan - 31/2.

152
00:07:56,675 --> 00:07:59,611
In the past - and we know
this from fossil records -

153
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:03,148
damselflies got a lot, lot bigger.

154
00:08:03,315 --> 00:08:04,849
About a size like that.

155
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:06,284
And why was that?

156
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:09,120
Well, one simple reason - oxygen.

157
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,827
We humans have evolved in
an atmosphere with only 20% oxygen.

158
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,262
We're used to it.

159
00:08:17,429 --> 00:08:20,865
That's enough for me
to cycle hard for five minutes,

160
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:22,667
no problems.

161
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,436
I feel okay.

162
00:08:25,604 --> 00:08:27,839
Enough oxygen here, you know.

163
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:30,842
But damselflies -

164
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,144
and their close relations, the dragonflies -

165
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:34,512
evolved long ago,

166
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,349
when there was twice
as much oxygen as there is today.

167
00:08:38,517 --> 00:08:42,821
Now, with more oxygen,
flying insects became giants.

168
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:47,125
Imagine dragonflies with a 2-foot wingspan.

169
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,697
Then imagine what happened
when the world's oxygen levels halved.

170
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:56,167
Scientists think that decomposing
bacteria and fungi

171
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:59,003
began using a lot more of it.

172
00:09:00,906 --> 00:09:04,976
With less oxygen in the air,
the insect shrunk.

173
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:08,146
Now, if lowering oxygen can shrink a bug,

174
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:12,016
I'd like to know, what could it do to me?

175
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:16,254
I've asked my TV crew to find me
a hyperbaric chamber.

176
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:21,125
These help scuba divers recover
from the bends by increasing oxygen.

177
00:09:21,293 --> 00:09:26,531
Now, for me, they will reduce it by half.

178
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,333
When I take off my mask,

179
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,770
it will be like trying to breathe
on top of Mount Everest.

180
00:09:32,938 --> 00:09:34,806
Here we go.

181
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:37,108
Ugh!

182
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,646
Oh, it's tough.

183
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:44,249
As soon as I start pedaling, I want to stop.

184
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,217
I have no energy.

185
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:48,953
After a minute, my heart is thumping,

186
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:51,756
and by two minutes, I can't get enough air.

187
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,093
My muscles are screaming in pain.

188
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,529
21/2 minutes gone.

189
00:09:58,697 --> 00:10:03,134
Ohh. 57% oxygen in my blood.
It's a lot less.

190
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:06,604
So it's really getting tough.

191
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,506
How are you feeling?

192
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:11,776
Really tired. And a bit headachey.

193
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:16,447
I'm worried how less oxygen
will affect my brain.

194
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:19,117
You see, our brains only weigh
2% of our body weight

195
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:23,021
but use nearly 20% of all the oxygen
we breathe.

196
00:10:23,188 --> 00:10:24,188
Without enough oxygen,

197
00:10:24,356 --> 00:10:29,494
we'd suffer memory loss,
blindness, and blackout.

198
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,000
Can I go back now?

199
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,436
I want to go back.

200
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:40,738
I'm gonna go back. Hang on.

201
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:47,512
I - I tell you what -

202
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,214
Out here it feels like I'm in a...

203
00:10:50,382 --> 00:10:53,818
in an enormous carbon dioxide
or nitrogen bubble,

204
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,954
and I can't get enough air.

205
00:10:56,121 --> 00:10:59,991
I - I - I do need air.

206
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,127
You need air to perform.

207
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,364
You need air - you need air to...

208
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:09,968
Trying to work without enough oxygen
is the worst feeling.

209
00:11:10,135 --> 00:11:12,737
I want to cry. I want to sleep.

210
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:15,006
I feel terrible.

211
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:20,278
But my problems are really small
compared to bugs.

212
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:23,081
Their respiration is inefficient.

213
00:11:23,248 --> 00:11:25,550
They carry little oxygen in their blood,

214
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,352
and they rely on air coming in

215
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,957
through tiny portholes, or spiracles,
along the sides of their bodies.

216
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,193
So a bug's size is limited

217
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,596
by the amount of oxygen it can absorb.

218
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,470
My search for the biggest bug

219
00:11:45,637 --> 00:11:47,972
takes me back to Queensland, Australia.

220
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,774
If I were to describe to you

221
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:52,610
an insect that can grow
up to 8 inches in length,

222
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:56,681
has perfect 360-degree vision,

223
00:11:56,849 --> 00:12:01,352
lightning-fast reflexes both
in attack and in defense,

224
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,988
what do you think
such an insect would look like?

225
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,724
You guessed it. A praying mantis.

226
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,527
A predator that can blend into the foliage,

227
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:11,496
stay still as a statue,

228
00:12:11,663 --> 00:12:16,901
but then strike fast enough
to catch flies and wasps in midair.

229
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,204
Praying mantis's weapons of choice

230
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,874
are their pairs of extraordinary front legs

231
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,309
that are like spring-loaded jackknives.

232
00:12:25,477 --> 00:12:29,147
They use them to lunge
and then hold their victims.

233
00:12:29,314 --> 00:12:30,314
It's amazing.

234
00:12:30,482 --> 00:12:33,918
This praying mantis has given
two of her six legs...

235
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,087
...and modified them
to such an extent

236
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,189
that they're only killing machines.

237
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:42,727
But as skilled and as lethal as
these predators are,

238
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:44,929
they must be very careful...

239
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:48,533
...not to end up as the prey
of much bigger killers.

240
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,502
So how do praying mantises avoid ending up

241
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,705
on other predators' breakfast tables?

242
00:12:54,873 --> 00:12:57,875
Their first line of defense is camouflage.

243
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:01,746
All mantises blend into their environment,

244
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:05,850
but few go as far as the orchid mantis.

245
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:09,320
It even sways like an orchid in the breeze.

246
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:13,424
It can also hide in papaya
and frangipani flowers.

247
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:17,128
Even its legs are shaped like petals.

248
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,031
Just beautiful.

249
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:26,604
But praying mantises have
another trick up their sleeves.

250
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:30,608
When cornered by predators
- even much bigger ones -

251
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:34,312
they will stand and fight.

252
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:44,589
So size is not a big deal
to a praying mantis.

253
00:13:44,756 --> 00:13:45,990
It's attitude.

254
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,060
And no matter how big
or how small the mantis,

255
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:52,230
inside they all think they are giants.

256
00:13:52,397 --> 00:13:56,434
So how can a small mantis beat a big enemy?

257
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:59,303
Well, my TV crew has sent me
on a mystery mission

258
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:00,671
to discover their secret.

259
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,542
I'm to receive my instructions
via text message.

260
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:06,878
"Prepare 4 combat!

261
00:14:07,045 --> 00:14:10,548
Tiffany, your host, is the mantis... "

262
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,617
Ha ha ha.

263
00:14:12,784 --> 00:14:15,453
Oh, I get it.

264
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,623
Tiffany is an exponent of mantis kung fu,

265
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,725
and I've got to fight her.

266
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:25,796
Are you sure I'm gonna need all this?

267
00:14:25,964 --> 00:14:28,432
Yes. You'll need it.

268
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:31,769
"Your challenge is to pin her arms

269
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:34,071
for just one second. "

270
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,442
AII I know about mantis kung fu

271
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:42,180
is that it was developed hundreds of
years ago by a Chinese student

272
00:14:42,347 --> 00:14:45,349
who closely watched the moves
of the praying mantis.

273
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:50,254
There's something like 12 arm
moves copied from the praying mantis.

274
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:52,890
Hmm. Her technique looks really good.

275
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,859
But my arms are longer.

276
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:30,161
Ah. Ha ha.

277
00:15:31,396 --> 00:15:32,396
Ding!

278
00:15:46,144 --> 00:15:47,144
Ugh!

279
00:15:47,312 --> 00:15:49,680
Oh, I give up. Give up.

280
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,750
Shows you, though,

281
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:55,953
when you're small and you got technique,

282
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,922
you can battle just about anything.

283
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:01,158
I mean, I'm no slouch. Pbht!

284
00:16:01,326 --> 00:16:03,127
But this was too quick. This was technique.

285
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:07,565
This was small, fast, and furious.

286
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:12,403
Inside every praying mantis
beats the heart of a giant.

287
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:14,672
Next, bugs that are not only big

288
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,807
but tough when the going gets cold.

289
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:26,651
A bug with tusks? Yeah, that's right.

290
00:16:26,818 --> 00:16:29,253
They're on the face of a tusked weta.

291
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,689
Wetas are related to crickets
and grasshoppers,

292
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:35,059
and tusked weta males
use their tusks for fighting,

293
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:38,462
just like male elephants or walrus.

294
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,302
They fight for territory and for females.

295
00:16:44,469 --> 00:16:46,304
And battles like this have been going on

296
00:16:46,471 --> 00:16:49,407
for nearly 300 million years.

297
00:16:49,574 --> 00:16:53,110
They are truly, truly ancient.

298
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:54,412
Wetas might be ancient,

299
00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:56,847
but they're still being
discovered in New Zealand

300
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:58,049
as we speak.

301
00:16:58,216 --> 00:16:59,650
This creature is the tusked weta.

302
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:02,353
It was only found a few years ago.

303
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,755
It's rare. It is very, very rare -

304
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:06,691
...so rare that they're breeding
it in captivity

305
00:17:06,858 --> 00:17:08,492
so that, in a few years' time,

306
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,128
this fellow might have
a few more females to fight over.

307
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,998
Now, wouldn't that be
a good idea, my friend?

308
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:21,238
Tusked wetas are one of
several different wetas in New Zealand.

309
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:25,609
They include giants like this.

310
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:30,548
Giant wetas are super heavy
weights of the bug world.

311
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,783
And because they weigh more than 3 ounces,

312
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:36,821
they're right up there amongst
the world's heaviest bugs.

313
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,792
But by far the coolest weta of them all

314
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,729
lives to the south of here
in the mountains of New Zealand.

315
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:48,132
And when I say "cool," I mean cool.

316
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:53,270
The mountain weta survives
under the ice all winter long.

317
00:17:53,438 --> 00:17:56,240
And when spring comes
and the sun thaws the ice,

318
00:17:56,408 --> 00:18:00,010
it emerges from its frozen tomb,
just like magic.

319
00:18:00,178 --> 00:18:01,779
But it is not magic.

320
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:03,814
You see, the weta has special chemicals

321
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:08,452
that prevent harmful ice crystals
forming within its cells.

322
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,990
Now, that was a clever trick.
Could I do that?

323
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:16,961
So I can appreciate the alpine
conditions wetas cope with,

324
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,829
I've come to a human-performance center,

325
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:22,600
where Dr. John Marsden will let me
experience what it is like

326
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,668
to be in the mountains
in the middle of winter.

327
00:18:24,836 --> 00:18:27,371
And like wetas, I'll have no clothes,

328
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:30,107
except for a pair of shorts for modesty.

329
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,511
The freezer has been set to
16 degrees Fahrenheit,

330
00:18:33,678 --> 00:18:35,679
or minus-8 Celsius.

331
00:18:35,847 --> 00:18:38,749
And the cold hits me like a brick.

332
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:41,452
We are not built for the cold.

333
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,787
If our temperatures drop

334
00:18:42,954 --> 00:18:45,189
more than just a few degrees for too long,

335
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:47,792
we get hypothermia, which can kill us.

336
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:49,994
But all it would do to the mountain weta

337
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,863
would be to slow it down a bit.

338
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:54,331
To the old mountain weta,

339
00:18:54,499 --> 00:18:56,233
this must be like the first day of winter,

340
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:59,036
and they're just getting into their game.

341
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:01,739
I'm starting to conk out.

342
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:03,707
They thrive at these sort of temperatures.

343
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,342
It's unbelievable.

344
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,211
But I have to keep warm,

345
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:09,513
and I can do that by running and jumping

346
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:13,317
because when my muscles are working,
they generate heat.

347
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:21,225
By 15 minutes, running can't keep me
warm anymore.

348
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:23,327
This is where the weta and I differ.

349
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,529
You see, the weta will continue cooling

350
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:28,332
until it is as cold as ice -

351
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,536
not moving, not eating, as if it was dead.

352
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:33,938
I can't do that.

353
00:19:34,105 --> 00:19:36,607
I must stay warm if I'm to survive.

354
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:39,777
I'm literally freezing from the outside in.

355
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:42,680
As I get colder, my body
sacrifices my outer layer

356
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:47,651
to keep my center part warm,
particularly my heart and brain.

357
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,722
But my brain's already cooling.

358
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,259
John's math tests are becoming impossible.

359
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,328
44 plus 18.

360
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:00,097
44 and 18. 44 and 18...

361
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:07,505
60-something - 2.

362
00:20:07,672 --> 00:20:08,906
59 plus 21.

363
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,310
Oh, 59...

364
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:16,146
80- 80.

365
00:20:16,314 --> 00:20:19,250
Okay, that took over a minute
there to get those done,

366
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:21,418
so we're getting pretty near the edge here.

367
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:23,020
If the temperature goes much lower,

368
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:25,022
then we'll pull you out of there.

369
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,524
Okay.

370
00:20:29,026 --> 00:20:30,259
Ruud, do you want to tell us

371
00:20:30,427 --> 00:20:32,795
how you're feeling at the moment?

372
00:20:32,963 --> 00:20:35,698
I don't think I've ever been this cold.

373
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:39,802
It really hurts my ears
and my hands and my fingers.

374
00:20:41,805 --> 00:20:44,107
It's actually quite awful.

375
00:20:44,274 --> 00:20:46,042
I think it's about time to pull out now.

376
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:49,145
Okay. Come and get me.

377
00:20:49,313 --> 00:20:52,849
My core temperature is now lowering,
and that's critical.

378
00:20:53,016 --> 00:20:55,818
It's reached a point where to go any lower

379
00:20:55,986 --> 00:20:57,553
would be very dangerous.

380
00:20:57,721 --> 00:21:01,090
Ahh.

381
00:21:01,258 --> 00:21:03,025
Ah, the sun.

382
00:21:03,193 --> 00:21:05,561
Warm. Ooh.

383
00:21:05,729 --> 00:21:07,830
I had to get out of there.

384
00:21:07,998 --> 00:21:09,465
I had to get out.

385
00:21:09,633 --> 00:21:12,435
That mountain weta has got
an ability that I cannot match.

386
00:21:12,603 --> 00:21:16,139
I suppose that's one up for the bugs, eh?

387
00:21:18,613 --> 00:21:20,814
My search for the world's biggest bug

388
00:21:20,982 --> 00:21:25,019
now takes me to the Venezuelan
rainforest in the rain.

389
00:21:28,156 --> 00:21:30,491
This is what rainforest is all about,

390
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:35,462
and these are conditions
that the next creature really likes.

391
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,897
Have a look at this.

392
00:21:37,065 --> 00:21:39,466
We're going large now, man. Look at this.

393
00:21:39,634 --> 00:21:43,170
61/2, maybe 7 inch of the giant millipede.

394
00:21:43,338 --> 00:21:45,873
Beautiful creature. Very thin-skinned.

395
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:49,043
This is why it cannot afford
to lose much moisture.

396
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,678
This is why it likes to be hidden

397
00:21:50,845 --> 00:21:52,680
and comes out when it rains.

398
00:21:52,847 --> 00:21:55,916
Look at it move, will you?
Isn't it just spectacular?

399
00:21:56,084 --> 00:22:00,421
So graceful the way
all these legs are coordinated.

400
00:22:11,399 --> 00:22:14,568
Now, as I said, they are totally
harmless to human beings.

401
00:22:14,736 --> 00:22:16,437
But there is a similar sort of species

402
00:22:16,604 --> 00:22:19,406
that, uh, hmm, needs a little bit more care

403
00:22:19,574 --> 00:22:21,308
when you encounter it.

404
00:22:26,481 --> 00:22:28,515
Something down the road.
They found something.

405
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:32,986
Whoa.

406
00:22:34,422 --> 00:22:35,856
What's that?

407
00:22:36,024 --> 00:22:37,424
Con cuidado.

408
00:22:37,592 --> 00:22:38,992
Let's have a look.

409
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,828
Be careful, be careful.

410
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:45,265
Oh, no. There it is - giant centipede.

411
00:22:45,433 --> 00:22:46,333
Hang on, hang on.

412
00:22:46,501 --> 00:22:49,837
Don't - Hang on. Here we go.

413
00:22:50,004 --> 00:22:53,440
You don't want that to go away.
That is a mean predator.

414
00:22:53,608 --> 00:22:55,376
That is one of those ones

415
00:22:55,543 --> 00:22:56,677
that you don't put your hands in front.

416
00:22:56,845 --> 00:22:58,779
You treat him with respect.

417
00:22:58,947 --> 00:23:02,049
And once it's disturbed,
it raises its hind legs

418
00:23:02,217 --> 00:23:03,650
because it's in the defense mode.

419
00:23:03,818 --> 00:23:05,853
And, boy, it's got fangs. Mwah!

420
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,454
Like this. Like knives and forks.

421
00:23:07,622 --> 00:23:09,390
You don't want to be...

422
00:23:16,731 --> 00:23:19,500
I'll show you what you don't do.
You don't touch centipedes.

423
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:21,602
But you can, if you're careful,
stroke the back.

424
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,404
Oopsy-daisy.

425
00:23:23,571 --> 00:23:25,572
Huffy-puffy. Bit of a temper here.

426
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,075
Oops. Thank you.

427
00:23:28,243 --> 00:23:30,244
Look. See that? And then these rear legs.

428
00:23:30,412 --> 00:23:33,046
Now, if I would do this
with the rear legs, it would grab me,

429
00:23:33,214 --> 00:23:36,417
turn around, make a figure of eight,
and bite me.

430
00:23:36,584 --> 00:23:37,885
There's no doubt about it.

431
00:23:38,052 --> 00:23:41,655
Those fangs at the front
are the first front legs,

432
00:23:41,823 --> 00:23:44,858
which have been - in evolution,
if you like - made hollow

433
00:23:45,026 --> 00:23:47,494
and, with a poison gland from its head,

434
00:23:47,662 --> 00:23:49,096
made into poisonous fangs.

435
00:23:49,264 --> 00:23:52,699
But they are really modified first legs.

436
00:23:52,867 --> 00:23:54,234
God, look at it.

437
00:23:54,402 --> 00:23:57,838
It's sick of me. It's sick of me.

438
00:23:58,006 --> 00:24:01,375
Look out, look out, look out.
Camera, camera, camera, camera!

439
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:14,221
When a giant centipede gets hold of you,
it doesn't let go.

440
00:24:14,389 --> 00:24:16,323
And when it goes hunting,

441
00:24:16,491 --> 00:24:20,694
everything from bugs to birds
to lizards should watch out.

442
00:24:22,397 --> 00:24:23,797
It's a great climber.

443
00:24:23,965 --> 00:24:25,933
It's built for searching in holes.

444
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,801
Nothing is safe.

445
00:24:29,537 --> 00:24:32,439
For its size, it's the ultimate predator.

446
00:24:32,607 --> 00:24:36,510
And its big advantage
is its shape and speed.

447
00:24:36,678 --> 00:24:39,646
Long, thin, and very fast.

448
00:24:39,814 --> 00:24:42,616
How do you beat a bug like that?

449
00:24:43,485 --> 00:24:46,353
This little demonstration
is all about body shape.

450
00:24:46,521 --> 00:24:50,057
It's a race between the beetles
versus the centipede.

451
00:24:50,225 --> 00:24:53,727
Now, I am the big, round, bumbling beetle.

452
00:24:53,895 --> 00:24:57,064
And over there is, um, centipede man.

453
00:24:57,232 --> 00:24:58,899
Go, beetles!

454
00:25:08,243 --> 00:25:09,676
Go!

455
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,618
Ha ha!

456
00:25:31,266 --> 00:25:33,066
Oh, you!

457
00:25:44,946 --> 00:25:47,581
When you have to get a lot of body

458
00:25:47,749 --> 00:25:49,950
through a very small space in a hurry,

459
00:25:50,118 --> 00:25:53,020
it pays to be long, flat, and thin -

460
00:25:53,187 --> 00:25:54,788
built like a centipede.

461
00:25:54,956 --> 00:25:57,724
You won, mate.

462
00:25:58,393 --> 00:26:00,127
We were so lucky to find this.

463
00:26:00,295 --> 00:26:02,663
I mean, they lead such a sheltered
and hidden life.

464
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,064
I'm gonna put it back, though

465
00:26:04,232 --> 00:26:06,667
because it really doesn't want to dry out.

466
00:26:06,834 --> 00:26:08,502
Oh, now, man. Here we go.

467
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,671
The king of the predators of the jungle.

468
00:26:10,838 --> 00:26:13,006
Isn't it gorgeous? Ooh!

469
00:26:13,174 --> 00:26:14,241
Lucky us, lucky us.

470
00:26:14,409 --> 00:26:15,909
Come on, mate. This is where you live.

471
00:26:16,077 --> 00:26:18,111
Here we go. Put it right down here.

472
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:20,247
Come on. Bye-bye.

473
00:26:20,415 --> 00:26:21,782
Have a good time.

474
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,817
I'm getting out of your way.

475
00:26:24,886 --> 00:26:26,787
Down here. Come on.

476
00:26:26,955 --> 00:26:28,288
Tut! Whoa!

477
00:26:28,456 --> 00:26:30,157
There you go. Bye-bye.

478
00:26:30,325 --> 00:26:32,659
Making your body long and thin is one way

479
00:26:32,827 --> 00:26:34,628
of getting among the world's biggest bugs,

480
00:26:34,796 --> 00:26:37,497
but the next bug has done that to the max.

481
00:26:42,837 --> 00:26:44,638
I've been sitting here now for half an hour,

482
00:26:44,806 --> 00:26:46,873
not 10 foot from a tree,

483
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:50,077
looking for one of the
largest insects in the world,

484
00:26:50,244 --> 00:26:52,412
and I can't see it.

485
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,648
I'm gonna give it a bit longer.

486
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:04,891
This creature's been eluding me
for so long, I've had enough.

487
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:07,794
I'm going to get in there and get it.

488
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,000
Whoops.

489
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:15,102
This is the place where you find them.

490
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:16,703
On the leaves.

491
00:27:16,871 --> 00:27:18,238
They sit on the outside of the tree,

492
00:27:18,406 --> 00:27:19,406
and they gobble up leaves.

493
00:27:19,574 --> 00:27:20,907
But despite their size,

494
00:27:21,075 --> 00:27:24,077
they're surprisingly
difficult to find, actually.

495
00:27:24,245 --> 00:27:26,113
Here it is. This is it.

496
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,483
This is a leaf insect.

497
00:27:29,651 --> 00:27:31,785
Some people call them stick insects,

498
00:27:31,953 --> 00:27:33,286
and they belong to the same group.

499
00:27:33,454 --> 00:27:35,122
Look. I'll come down, and I'll show you.

500
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:37,124
Yah! Whoa.

501
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:39,192
There we are with the leaf insect.

502
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,229
Now, leaf insects and
stick insects are closely related,

503
00:27:42,397 --> 00:27:44,665
and they all got one thing in common.

504
00:27:44,832 --> 00:27:47,000
They can grow to huge sizes.

505
00:27:47,168 --> 00:27:49,770
Now, you wonder why they get so big, eh?

506
00:27:49,937 --> 00:27:51,772
The trick apparently is that -

507
00:27:51,939 --> 00:27:55,075
You think about little warblers
and little insect-eating birds.

508
00:27:55,243 --> 00:27:56,610
They come across something like that,

509
00:27:56,778 --> 00:28:00,047
and they say, "Whoa! Whoa! Back the bus up!

510
00:28:00,214 --> 00:28:03,050
That's too much of a mouthful.
I can't handle that. "

511
00:28:03,217 --> 00:28:06,620
So size is a protection from being eaten.

512
00:28:06,788 --> 00:28:07,821
But there's something else.

513
00:28:07,989 --> 00:28:09,690
There's this wonderful camouflage.

514
00:28:09,857 --> 00:28:11,458
Because if they can help it,

515
00:28:11,626 --> 00:28:13,460
they don't even want to become discovered.

516
00:28:13,628 --> 00:28:15,662
They just look like their environment.

517
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,931
But does camouflage really work?

518
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:21,234
Can a stick insect really fool a predator?

519
00:28:21,402 --> 00:28:22,903
I've told my TV crew

520
00:28:23,071 --> 00:28:25,138
to see if they can fool me with camouflage.

521
00:28:25,306 --> 00:28:26,540
So, here's the challenge.

522
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:28,175
I've been told there's food upstairs,

523
00:28:28,342 --> 00:28:30,343
and I've got two minutes
to eat as much as I can.

524
00:28:31,546 --> 00:28:34,681
Hey, this is the sort of job I like.

525
00:28:41,122 --> 00:28:42,522
Mmm.

526
00:28:58,473 --> 00:29:00,273
Nothing to it. Very easy. Yummy.

527
00:29:00,441 --> 00:29:01,408
Mmm, great.

528
00:29:01,576 --> 00:29:04,745
And now I get to do that all over again.

529
00:29:04,912 --> 00:29:06,880
But this time, the rules have changed.

530
00:29:07,048 --> 00:29:09,015
This time, there's still lots of food,

531
00:29:09,183 --> 00:29:11,485
but it's all disguised - camouflage.

532
00:29:11,652 --> 00:29:13,353
It doesn't look like food,

533
00:29:13,521 --> 00:29:16,957
just like a stick insect
doesn't look like food.

534
00:29:25,466 --> 00:29:27,601
Mmh.

535
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:29,469
There's nothing here.

536
00:29:31,005 --> 00:29:32,439
It's empty.

537
00:29:32,607 --> 00:29:34,908
This is ridiculous.

538
00:29:40,414 --> 00:29:41,948
Time's up.

539
00:29:42,116 --> 00:29:44,584
I'm hungry. I can't see anything, honestly.

540
00:29:44,752 --> 00:29:46,620
This is a list of all the things

541
00:29:46,788 --> 00:29:48,622
I've apparently missed in this room.

542
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,824
Didn't know. Gonna have a look.

543
00:29:54,495 --> 00:29:56,563
Oh, hello.

544
00:29:56,731 --> 00:29:58,431
Wow.

545
00:30:01,502 --> 00:30:02,869
Well, you can eat that.

546
00:30:03,037 --> 00:30:06,640
Blow me days. Clever.

547
00:30:08,576 --> 00:30:11,044
You can eat that.

548
00:30:11,212 --> 00:30:12,813
Look at this.

549
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,848
Did you see that?

550
00:30:15,016 --> 00:30:15,849
No idea.

551
00:30:18,085 --> 00:30:20,387
Look!
Very good one.

552
00:30:20,555 --> 00:30:22,856
This is not cable.

553
00:30:25,526 --> 00:30:27,427
Licorice. I love licorice.

554
00:30:30,231 --> 00:30:32,499
There's something else.

555
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:34,835
The list.

556
00:30:35,002 --> 00:30:36,937
Oh, it was great camouflage.

557
00:30:37,104 --> 00:30:40,640
How much would you have got?
Okay, the rose was icing.

558
00:30:40,808 --> 00:30:43,476
The plate was marzipan. So was the cup.

559
00:30:43,644 --> 00:30:45,345
And the TV cable was licorice.

560
00:30:45,513 --> 00:30:49,115
And the list was written on rice paper.

561
00:30:49,283 --> 00:30:51,251
And that is what it is all about.

562
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:53,820
Stick insects are absolutely
wonderful at this!

563
00:30:53,988 --> 00:30:55,922
They just look like a twig and think,

564
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:58,959
"See if you can find me.
See if you want to eat me. "

565
00:31:02,597 --> 00:31:05,665
Stick and leaf insects are
peaceful vegetarians.

566
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:08,768
That's why they must be
perfect at camouflage.

567
00:31:08,936 --> 00:31:11,471
They have no other way to
protect themselves.

568
00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:16,243
This one is just like lichen
growing on a tree trunk.

569
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:18,778
How about this leaf insect?

570
00:31:18,946 --> 00:31:20,080
It's so perfect,

571
00:31:20,248 --> 00:31:22,515
it has insect bites taken out of it.

572
00:31:22,683 --> 00:31:24,718
And a leaf-eating leaf.

573
00:31:24,886 --> 00:31:27,087
How about that?

574
00:31:28,522 --> 00:31:30,724
But even their eggs are camouflaged.

575
00:31:30,892 --> 00:31:34,094
They look like seeds on the forest floor.

576
00:31:36,898 --> 00:31:39,332
And when the young hatch,

577
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,968
they're camouflaged to look like ants

578
00:31:42,136 --> 00:31:44,070
and instinctively climb straight up

579
00:31:44,238 --> 00:31:46,773
into the branches of the nearest tree.

580
00:31:51,312 --> 00:31:54,147
Many stick insects have
one more amazing trick.

581
00:31:54,315 --> 00:31:57,083
Some females don't even
mate to produce babies.

582
00:31:57,251 --> 00:31:59,352
They do it all on their own.

583
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,855
Unfertilized eggs hatch into females

584
00:32:02,023 --> 00:32:04,324
that grow up to produce more females.

585
00:32:04,492 --> 00:32:08,295
Instant family! Ha! Very clever.

586
00:32:09,297 --> 00:32:11,932
The spiny leaf insect might be big,

587
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:14,968
but it certainly isn't the fastest
creature on this planet.

588
00:32:15,136 --> 00:32:17,270
Oh, no, no, no. But she knows
where she's going.

589
00:32:17,438 --> 00:32:19,906
She's going up there to blend
in with the foliage

590
00:32:20,074 --> 00:32:22,709
and to eat a little bit more
and grow a little bit bigger.

591
00:32:22,877 --> 00:32:25,178
Now, while she's racing up into the tree,

592
00:32:25,346 --> 00:32:27,847
I might go away to see
if I can find something

593
00:32:28,015 --> 00:32:29,883
even bigger than this.

594
00:32:33,321 --> 00:32:35,255
Go left! Slightly left!
That's it! That's it!

595
00:32:35,423 --> 00:32:37,924
Up the trunk, up the trunk, up the trunk!

596
00:32:38,092 --> 00:32:40,694
Yeah. Oh! Oh, just don't never mind.

597
00:32:40,861 --> 00:32:42,429
I'll come down. Here we go.

598
00:32:42,596 --> 00:32:43,964
Aah! Oh, no!

599
00:32:44,131 --> 00:32:45,732
Ugh.

600
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,167
Boy, oh, boy. Oh.

601
00:32:47,335 --> 00:32:49,970
Are you all right?
Are you okay, dear sticky?

602
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:54,074
Oh! I think she's in better shape than I am.

603
00:32:54,942 --> 00:32:56,242
Isn't it a beauty?

604
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:59,980
Now, this is the giant
Malaysian stick insect,

605
00:33:00,147 --> 00:33:03,583
and it's one of those creatures
that lives way up in the canopy

606
00:33:03,751 --> 00:33:05,719
because it pretends to be a stick,

607
00:33:05,886 --> 00:33:08,421
not a big, fat trunk like that.

608
00:33:08,589 --> 00:33:09,956
The Malaysian giant stick insect

609
00:33:10,124 --> 00:33:11,992
is the longest insect in the world.

610
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:13,360
Well, not this particular one.

611
00:33:13,527 --> 00:33:18,431
But somewhere out there-
somewhere is its biggest cousin.

612
00:33:20,134 --> 00:33:22,268
The longest stick insect in the world

613
00:33:22,436 --> 00:33:25,138
was a Malaysian forest walking stick.

614
00:33:25,306 --> 00:33:29,509
It was found some years ago
and was just under 2 foot long.

615
00:33:43,758 --> 00:33:47,527
I'm Ruud Kleinpaste,
and my search for the biggest bug

616
00:33:47,695 --> 00:33:51,898
takes me back to the
rainforests of Latin America.

617
00:33:57,738 --> 00:34:00,974
Oh.

618
00:34:01,142 --> 00:34:03,043
Look at that.

619
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:06,746
That is the largest arachnid in the world -

620
00:34:06,914 --> 00:34:07,947
the largest bug.

621
00:34:08,115 --> 00:34:10,950
It takes the cake. It is the champion.

622
00:34:11,118 --> 00:34:12,485
Whoo.

623
00:34:12,653 --> 00:34:17,824
These spiders can grow up to
12 inches across in every way you look

624
00:34:17,992 --> 00:34:20,994
They can be a quarter pound
in terms of weight.

625
00:34:21,162 --> 00:34:22,729
Can you imagine that?

626
00:34:22,897 --> 00:34:27,133
These are the things Hollywood
horror movies are made of.

627
00:34:48,122 --> 00:34:49,522
Magnificent.

628
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:51,391
What a monster. What a hunter.

629
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:53,793
No wonder they've made movie
about these things.

630
00:34:53,961 --> 00:34:56,529
Oh, man, they can kill people at 12 paces.

631
00:34:56,697 --> 00:34:59,165
That's all rubbish.

632
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:01,768
Look at this docile creature, will you?

633
00:35:01,936 --> 00:35:05,105
Sure, it's a hunter. Sure, it's big.

634
00:35:05,272 --> 00:35:07,040
But it's slow, too.

635
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:09,142
These creatures have no ears.

636
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:11,444
They've got eight eyes.
They can't see very well.

637
00:35:11,612 --> 00:35:15,615
But they have thousands of hairs
on their legs, on their bodies.

638
00:35:15,783 --> 00:35:19,552
And those hairs all help to monitor airflow.

639
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,789
That means
they can feel people coming closer.

640
00:35:22,957 --> 00:35:24,357
They can feel predators coming closer.

641
00:35:24,525 --> 00:35:26,493
They can feel prey coming closer, as well.

642
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,294
If I make a quick move like this...

643
00:35:28,462 --> 00:35:30,630
You see immediately how she reacts.

644
00:35:30,798 --> 00:35:32,832
She can feel this easily,

645
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,002
just with all those hairs
on these wonderful legs.

646
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,070
Come on. Turn it down.

647
00:35:37,238 --> 00:35:39,272
It's all right, girl.
I wasn't gonna hurt you.

648
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,543
See, if I were a predator,
I would always go from the back,

649
00:35:43,711 --> 00:35:45,512
knowing that the fangs are at the front.

650
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:47,113
And when I come from the back...

651
00:35:47,281 --> 00:35:48,548
Oops! Pbht!

652
00:35:48,716 --> 00:35:52,085
What it does is it dislodges all these hairs

653
00:35:52,253 --> 00:35:53,653
straight into my face.

654
00:35:54,989 --> 00:35:56,222
The hairs are venomous

655
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:59,959
and cause irritation to skin,
eyes, and nose.

656
00:36:00,127 --> 00:36:01,794
But the hairs also tell us

657
00:36:01,962 --> 00:36:04,697
that goliath spiders are,
in fact, giant tarantulas.

658
00:36:04,865 --> 00:36:09,235
And like all tarantulas, they are predators.

659
00:36:09,403 --> 00:36:12,872
They ambush prey and kill with
venom from their fangs.

660
00:36:14,942 --> 00:36:19,045
But they must take care
when they meet other goliath spiders.

661
00:36:22,716 --> 00:36:25,618
When a male and female
come together to mate,

662
00:36:25,786 --> 00:36:27,520
the male protects himself from her bite

663
00:36:27,688 --> 00:36:31,758
by holding her fangs
from special hooks on his legs

664
00:36:31,926 --> 00:36:33,560
while they copulate.

665
00:36:39,733 --> 00:36:43,369
There are no records of
goliath spiders actually killing humans

666
00:36:43,537 --> 00:36:47,907
but their bite is very,
very painful and can cause paralysis.

667
00:36:48,075 --> 00:36:52,345
Like most spiders,
they don't bite unless threatened.

668
00:36:54,949 --> 00:36:57,250
This is as large as spiders

669
00:36:57,418 --> 00:37:00,353
or, for that matter, any bugs can get.

670
00:37:00,521 --> 00:37:03,323
Any larger and they wouldn't be able

671
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:06,259
to get oxygen right to their bodies.

672
00:37:06,427 --> 00:37:08,194
Oh, where you going? Where you going?

673
00:37:08,362 --> 00:37:09,963
That's not where you should be going.

674
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:12,131
Hey. Oh, oh, oh.

675
00:37:14,668 --> 00:37:19,005
Isn't that gorgeous? Look at this.

676
00:37:19,173 --> 00:37:20,640
Come on.

677
00:37:20,808 --> 00:37:22,775
Off you go.

678
00:37:27,314 --> 00:37:29,582
Where's she gone? Right.

679
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:31,217
That's what I call a good spider.

680
00:37:31,385 --> 00:37:32,418
Straight back.

681
00:37:32,586 --> 00:37:36,889
You see, the only time these
fierce predators are really vulnerable

682
00:37:37,057 --> 00:37:39,225
is when they molt.

683
00:37:40,928 --> 00:37:45,865
When a spider is about to molt,
it stops feeding and hides away.

684
00:37:46,033 --> 00:37:48,434
It also loses hair on its abdomen,

685
00:37:48,602 --> 00:37:52,338
and its skin has a slightly blue color.

686
00:37:52,506 --> 00:37:53,906
Under its old skin,

687
00:37:54,074 --> 00:37:56,576
there's a new, soft skin already forming.

688
00:37:56,744 --> 00:38:00,546
And between the two,
the spider injects a fluid.

689
00:38:00,714 --> 00:38:03,116
When the pressure of the fluid builds up,

690
00:38:03,284 --> 00:38:05,618
the old skin splits along its back,

691
00:38:05,786 --> 00:38:09,122
and the spider steps out of its old suit.

692
00:38:10,991 --> 00:38:15,395
Goliath spiders keep on
molting throughout their lives.

693
00:38:15,562 --> 00:38:17,764
As youngsters,
they change skin once a month.

694
00:38:17,931 --> 00:38:20,533
As adults, they molt once a year.

695
00:38:20,701 --> 00:38:25,171
Each skin they shed brings them
closer and closer to becoming giants

696
00:38:25,339 --> 00:38:28,174
and one of the world's biggest bugs.

697
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:34,013
The next bug might not beat
the giant spider for outright size,

698
00:38:34,181 --> 00:38:38,217
but it is a true champion
for weight and strength.

699
00:39:05,446 --> 00:39:09,282
There's something weird
and wonderful happening here.

700
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:12,218
And it's all to do with growing.

701
00:39:12,386 --> 00:39:15,722
Getting to become
a true giant of the bug world

702
00:39:15,889 --> 00:39:19,225
means eating your rotten wood
and plenty of it.

703
00:39:19,393 --> 00:39:22,595
Rotten logs build champions.

704
00:39:22,763 --> 00:39:25,098
Now, have a look at this.
Look what I've found.

705
00:39:25,265 --> 00:39:26,399
Hoo hoo hoo! Hoo hoo!

706
00:39:26,567 --> 00:39:29,635
This is merely a baby.

707
00:39:29,803 --> 00:39:33,973
It is the immature or larva
of the Hercules beetle.

708
00:39:34,141 --> 00:39:36,342
If you want to see something really nice,

709
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:39,345
have a look at this creature's father.

710
00:39:40,447 --> 00:39:45,251
The very best-fed larvae
get to become the biggest beetles.

711
00:39:45,419 --> 00:39:50,656
After spending over a year hidden
in the ground, munching away as a grub...

712
00:39:50,824 --> 00:39:54,293
...the adult Hercules beetle
finally emerges,

713
00:39:54,461 --> 00:39:57,096
as big as a truck.

714
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,101
Papa Hercules.

715
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:05,004
Isn't it a wonderful specimen? Look at it.

716
00:40:05,172 --> 00:40:08,040
This is as large as they're going to
get, those beetles.

717
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:11,511
It's a contender for
the heaviest insect in the world.

718
00:40:11,678 --> 00:40:15,381
And they're built - listen - like a nut.

719
00:40:15,549 --> 00:40:17,417
Strong and hard.

720
00:40:17,584 --> 00:40:21,020
They can lift 80 times
their own weight on top.

721
00:40:21,188 --> 00:40:25,057
Look, they're really, really,
really, really tough.

722
00:40:25,225 --> 00:40:27,260
Now, the horn - Yes.

723
00:40:27,428 --> 00:40:29,162
Well, that horn is not for aggression.

724
00:40:29,329 --> 00:40:30,296
Oh, no.

725
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:33,132
It's not even for defense against predators.

726
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,869
That beautiful horn is for jousting.

727
00:40:40,507 --> 00:40:45,378
And jousting is where size of
body and horns really counts.

728
00:40:45,546 --> 00:40:46,946
When a stranger comes along,

729
00:40:47,114 --> 00:40:49,415
it becomes a battle
to defend your home patch

730
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:51,350
and defend your food.

731
00:41:03,464 --> 00:41:06,432
The upper and lower horns move like a claw

732
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,837
to grasp an opponent
and throw him out of the ring.

733
00:41:13,307 --> 00:41:17,643
Among Hercules beetle males,
big is definitely best.

734
00:41:17,811 --> 00:41:20,379
And if a male can keep
his good feeding ground,

735
00:41:20,547 --> 00:41:23,483
it just might become a breeding ground.

736
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:24,784
If he wins,

737
00:41:24,952 --> 00:41:28,254
there's a good chance
he will also get the girl.

738
00:41:29,723 --> 00:41:32,658
To prove that size makes
a big beetle unbeatable,

739
00:41:32,826 --> 00:41:36,028
my TV crew has set up another challenge.

740
00:41:38,832 --> 00:41:41,234
Oh, no!

741
00:41:41,401 --> 00:41:43,503
Aw, a sumo wrestler!

742
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:44,837
Ugh.

743
00:41:45,005 --> 00:41:47,573
He's the big beetle.

744
00:41:48,775 --> 00:41:51,277
Oh, and there's the girl.

745
00:41:51,445 --> 00:41:55,047
And I guess I'm supposed to
push him out of the ring.

746
00:41:55,215 --> 00:41:56,716
Yeah, right.

747
00:42:31,275 --> 00:42:33,009
Hee hee hee!

748
00:42:33,177 --> 00:42:35,145
Oh ho ho ho ho!

749
00:42:35,312 --> 00:42:37,547
Hey!

750
00:42:48,993 --> 00:42:52,729
When two beetles fight,
it's all about territory,

751
00:42:52,897 --> 00:42:56,132
and the winner gets the territory.

752
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:59,135
And as a bonus, he gets the female, as well.

753
00:42:59,303 --> 00:43:00,770
Now, how cool is that?

754
00:43:00,938 --> 00:43:04,207
So you go claim your prize.

755
00:43:17,016 --> 00:43:19,518
Oh, I feel for male Hercules beetles,

756
00:43:19,685 --> 00:43:21,219
especially the losers.

757
00:43:21,387 --> 00:43:24,623
You know, it's not easy,
it's not fun, and it hurts.

758
00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:27,292
Oh ho! No!

759
00:43:28,014 --> 00:43:29,415
My journey now continues

760
00:43:29,582 --> 00:43:32,084
in search of the world's baddest bugs.

761
00:43:32,252 --> 00:43:33,352
I'm Ruud Kleinpaste,

762
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,588
and I'm going to need
all my experience as an entomologist

763
00:43:36,756 --> 00:43:38,457
if I am to avoid danger

764
00:43:38,625 --> 00:43:42,227
and discover why some bugs
can seriously hurt us...

765
00:43:42,395 --> 00:43:45,698
...and how others can cause
the deaths of millions of people.

766
00:43:45,865 --> 00:43:49,468
But first up, the stinkiest bugs
in the world.

767
00:43:49,636 --> 00:43:51,704
Ugh!

768
00:43:51,871 --> 00:43:54,006
It's just not a good idea.

769
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:56,809
This cute bug is called the man-faced bug,

770
00:43:56,976 --> 00:43:58,811
and I'm sure you can see why.

771
00:43:58,978 --> 00:44:01,947
Well, if I turned it around, you would see.

772
00:44:02,115 --> 00:44:05,084
That's better. Ooh, great hair.

773
00:44:05,251 --> 00:44:08,554
But wait. Is that Ronald Reagan?

774
00:44:08,722 --> 00:44:10,622
But what's the man-faced doing

775
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:12,991
amongst the baddest bugs in the world?

776
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:15,961
Well, it belongs to the stinkbug family.

777
00:44:16,129 --> 00:44:17,796
And where do they hang out?

778
00:44:17,964 --> 00:44:21,333
To find the worst-smelling bug in the world,

779
00:44:21,501 --> 00:44:24,903
all you really need to do is
go to a generic vegetable garden

780
00:44:25,071 --> 00:44:26,572
anywhere on this planet.

781
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:29,108
Now, I found some of these coreids

782
00:44:29,275 --> 00:44:31,210
right here on this sunflower.

783
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:34,580
I'm going to pick one up
to show you exactly what it is.

784
00:44:34,748 --> 00:44:36,615
Oopsy. Here's one. I got one. Aha.

785
00:44:36,783 --> 00:44:38,684
It's a beautiful,
beautiful creature, actually,

786
00:44:38,852 --> 00:44:40,252
because it's got these lovely legs

787
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:43,822
with these leaflike flaps on the side.

788
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:45,924
It's called a leaf-footed bug sometimes.

789
00:44:46,092 --> 00:44:47,893
Now, this is the point.

790
00:44:48,061 --> 00:44:52,364
If I were a bird - a young,
inexperienced bird -

791
00:44:52,532 --> 00:44:54,767
and I think, "Hmm. A leaf-footed bug.

792
00:44:54,934 --> 00:44:56,268
Let's have a go. "

793
00:44:56,436 --> 00:44:58,604
I would pick it in my mouth like this.

794
00:44:58,772 --> 00:45:01,106
They have this awful taste!

795
00:45:01,274 --> 00:45:03,308
And as a bird, I would - Oh!

796
00:45:03,476 --> 00:45:05,210
Oh, this is - Oh.

797
00:45:05,378 --> 00:45:08,347
As a bird, I'd learn my lesson.

798
00:45:08,515 --> 00:45:10,682
I would never, ever do that again.

799
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:14,052
Stinkbugs get stinky and horribly tasting

800
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:17,289
by feeding on plant juices
and using the toxins in the juice

801
00:45:17,457 --> 00:45:20,259
to manufacture bad smells and tastes.

802
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,795
They do it to keep predators away.

803
00:45:24,063 --> 00:45:26,198
Oh, this is a big one!
Yeah, this is a good one.

804
00:45:26,366 --> 00:45:28,534
I'm gonna try that one, too.

805
00:45:28,701 --> 00:45:30,202
Oh, a pretty good pong.

806
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:31,503
I wonder what it tastes like.

807
00:45:31,671 --> 00:45:33,472
Look at it. Beautiful, though.

808
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,074
Ugh!

809
00:45:36,242 --> 00:45:38,610
It's just not a good idea.

810
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:42,848
Stupid.
Bah!

811
00:45:43,016 --> 00:45:45,083
Go away. Get back.

812
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,153
If you don't believe me

813
00:45:48,321 --> 00:45:50,923
when I say that stinkbugs really smell,

814
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:54,226
that these cute little bugs
can make you gag,

815
00:45:54,394 --> 00:45:57,396
well, here's an independent
panel of sniffers

816
00:45:57,564 --> 00:45:59,431
that you might believe.

817
00:46:05,271 --> 00:46:06,605
Oh, my God!

818
00:46:10,243 --> 00:46:11,910
Smell it.

819
00:46:12,078 --> 00:46:13,445
Ew.

820
00:46:13,613 --> 00:46:15,414
No, no, no, no.

821
00:46:16,916 --> 00:46:18,217
Ugh!

822
00:46:18,384 --> 00:46:19,852
Oh!

823
00:46:21,588 --> 00:46:22,754
It's just a stinkbug.

824
00:46:22,922 --> 00:46:24,890
Pbht! Blimey. It is a stinkbug.

825
00:46:27,026 --> 00:46:28,694
Aah! Oh!

826
00:46:28,862 --> 00:46:30,629
Ohhhh!

827
00:46:30,797 --> 00:46:31,997
Aah!

828
00:46:34,567 --> 00:46:35,434
Yeah!

829
00:46:38,071 --> 00:46:39,371
Eww!

830
00:46:39,539 --> 00:46:40,839
Uh!

831
00:46:41,574 --> 00:46:43,141
Eww!

832
00:46:45,712 --> 00:46:47,846
That's the bug. He ate it.

833
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:49,848
Aah!

834
00:46:52,585 --> 00:46:54,920
Smells are bad, but they're not dangerous.

835
00:46:55,088 --> 00:46:56,855
Now, the next bug has a hot solution

836
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,790
to help escape predators.

837
00:47:08,968 --> 00:47:11,536
In nature, predators usually win.

838
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:15,874
So how can a defenseless creature
beat a hungry predator?

839
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:19,678
Answer - With a nasty surprise.

840
00:47:19,846 --> 00:47:22,648
Aaaah!

841
00:47:25,118 --> 00:47:28,954
Sometimes the best form of defense is attack

842
00:47:29,122 --> 00:47:30,389
or, rather, confusion.

843
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:33,926
And when you're a small bug
in a big, big forest,

844
00:47:34,093 --> 00:47:38,263
the more time you can buy yourself
by scaring your opponent

845
00:47:38,431 --> 00:47:40,565
the more time you have to get away.

846
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:42,768
Meet the bombardier beetle.

847
00:47:42,936 --> 00:47:46,571
Bombardier beetles are
the nutty professors of the bug world.

848
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:48,206
They create explosive reactions

849
00:47:48,374 --> 00:47:50,342
by combining chemicals inside their bodies.

850
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:53,178
And if you're on the wrong end
of that chemical explosion,

851
00:47:53,346 --> 00:47:55,280
then these guys are bad.

852
00:47:55,448 --> 00:47:56,648
But how bad?

853
00:47:56,816 --> 00:47:59,451
World bombardier expert
Tom Eisner should know.

854
00:47:59,619 --> 00:48:00,619
No, I haven't, actually.

855
00:48:00,787 --> 00:48:02,921
- Never seen one blast?
- No.

856
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:03,922
Let's do it.

857
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:06,325
What I'm going to make believe
is that I'm an ant.

858
00:48:06,492 --> 00:48:07,693
Oh, you are?

859
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:10,829
I'm gonna just bite him gently on the leg.

860
00:48:10,997 --> 00:48:12,264
Oh, where? Which side?

861
00:48:12,432 --> 00:48:14,099
The left front leg.

862
00:48:14,267 --> 00:48:15,634
Okay. Here we go.

863
00:48:15,802 --> 00:48:17,736
Oh!

864
00:48:17,904 --> 00:48:18,770
Oh, look at that.

865
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:20,405
And it squirted in your direction.

866
00:48:20,573 --> 00:48:23,008
He's the best marksman in the world.

867
00:48:23,176 --> 00:48:24,876
Wow. Look.

868
00:48:25,044 --> 00:48:27,746
It didn't miss a degree.

869
00:48:27,914 --> 00:48:30,148
- Okay. Watch the other leg.
- Okay. The other leg.

870
00:48:30,316 --> 00:48:33,018
We're gonna take the middle leg
from the other side.

871
00:48:33,186 --> 00:48:34,319
Here we go.

872
00:48:34,487 --> 00:48:36,154
Oh, yeah! Oh!

873
00:48:36,322 --> 00:48:38,223
Put on your goggles. Here are the forceps.

874
00:48:38,391 --> 00:48:41,259
Just pinch him very gently.
It doesn't take very much.

875
00:48:41,427 --> 00:48:43,462
Try the left hind leg.

876
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:46,198
Yes, I'll try the left hind leg. Here we go.

877
00:48:46,366 --> 00:48:48,000
Okay.

878
00:48:48,167 --> 00:48:49,568
Look out.

879
00:48:51,738 --> 00:48:54,506
- It works.
- Sensational.

880
00:48:54,674 --> 00:48:57,175
And imagine, he can do
this for about 30 times.

881
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:59,444
Ooh, that's a pretty good national average.

882
00:48:59,612 --> 00:49:00,812
It's a good national average,

883
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,015
and he's not forced to expend his supply,

884
00:49:03,182 --> 00:49:05,584
because after he fires,
he's coated with the stuff.

885
00:49:06,452 --> 00:49:08,887
The bombardier beetle is a walking zap gun.

886
00:49:09,055 --> 00:49:12,557
It's quick on the draw,
can fire in any direction,

887
00:49:12,725 --> 00:49:15,694
and it's guaranteed
to put off the biggest predator.

888
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:19,931
Thanks, Tom.

889
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:22,534
It was a random one.

890
00:49:22,702 --> 00:49:24,469
It got you straight in the nostrils.

891
00:49:24,637 --> 00:49:25,537
I'm sorry.

892
00:49:25,705 --> 00:49:27,739
No, that's...

893
00:49:27,907 --> 00:49:29,508
This is what it's all about.

894
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:30,842
This is the master blaster.

895
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:32,844
Oh, beetle. These are visitors.

896
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:34,579
Behave yourself.

897
00:49:34,747 --> 00:49:37,516
It's quite remarkable.

898
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:39,651
The mechanism is not unlike the one

899
00:49:39,819 --> 00:49:43,055
that the Germans put in
the V-1 rocket in World War II.

900
00:49:43,222 --> 00:49:47,426
It's also a system where chemicals
are mixed from two chambers.

901
00:49:47,593 --> 00:49:49,895
So to avoid getting zapped themselves,

902
00:49:50,063 --> 00:49:52,931
bombardier beetles keep
two chemicals apart in two chambers

903
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:55,367
and only mix them to blast an enemy

904
00:49:55,535 --> 00:49:57,969
with their boiling-hot, smelly gunk.

905
00:49:58,137 --> 00:50:01,373
This is concentrated hydrogen peroxide.

906
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:04,009
It is exactly the same material

907
00:50:04,177 --> 00:50:07,579
that is fabricated inside
the abdomen of the bombardier beetle.

908
00:50:07,747 --> 00:50:10,382
Can you imagine? It's rocket fuel.

909
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:13,318
That's what they send these
rockets up in the sky with.

910
00:50:13,486 --> 00:50:17,122
And I'm going to mimic exactly
what happens inside the bombardier beetle.

911
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:19,324
This is it. Look at it.

912
00:50:21,127 --> 00:50:24,029
First, a bit of peroxide. Here we go.

913
00:50:25,965 --> 00:50:29,434
To this we're going to add
something that reacts with it.

914
00:50:29,602 --> 00:50:32,137
It's a catalyst to set off the explosion.

915
00:50:32,305 --> 00:50:35,474
Now, I'd like you to meet my self here,

916
00:50:35,641 --> 00:50:37,809
standing just like that.

917
00:50:37,977 --> 00:50:39,845
And if this is the bombardier beetle,

918
00:50:40,012 --> 00:50:42,214
we're scaling everything up to my size.

919
00:50:42,381 --> 00:50:43,915
That's what we're trying to do here.

920
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:45,484
Watch what happens.

921
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:48,920
Holy moly!

922
00:50:53,459 --> 00:50:56,728
Ooh hoo! We got him, we got him! Yay!

923
00:51:08,876 --> 00:51:11,210
The search for the baddest bugs in the world

924
00:51:11,378 --> 00:51:12,812
brings me back to Latin America

925
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:16,983
and the busy shipping highway,
the Panama Canal.

926
00:51:17,751 --> 00:51:20,153
I'm Ruud Kleinpaste,
and I'm searching for a bug

927
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,288
that is the terror of the rainforest -

928
00:51:22,456 --> 00:51:26,225
a fierce predator that devours
over two pounds of bugs

929
00:51:26,393 --> 00:51:29,395
and other small creatures every day.

930
00:51:47,425 --> 00:51:49,260
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

931
00:51:49,427 --> 00:51:51,295
Oh, oh, oh.

932
00:51:53,765 --> 00:51:55,499
Here we are.

933
00:51:55,667 --> 00:51:58,302
Missed. Hang on,
hang on. Get one.

934
00:51:58,470 --> 00:51:59,937
Got one.

935
00:52:00,105 --> 00:52:03,007
This is what I'm looking for.

936
00:52:03,174 --> 00:52:06,243
This is what we call an army ant.

937
00:52:06,411 --> 00:52:08,112
Small, insignificant? Yes.

938
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,580
Aah! It bites. No, it stings.

939
00:52:09,748 --> 00:52:13,417
It does both Small
and insignificant perhaps,

940
00:52:13,585 --> 00:52:16,954
but it's part of a much larger community.

941
00:52:17,122 --> 00:52:20,124
We're talking about hundreds
of thousands of creatures.

942
00:52:20,292 --> 00:52:22,860
This is only a tiny-weeny column here.

943
00:52:23,028 --> 00:52:24,161
But if I'm going on,

944
00:52:24,329 --> 00:52:26,497
I'm sure I'll find a bigger trail than that.

945
00:52:26,665 --> 00:52:27,865
Isn't that amazing? Aah!

946
00:52:28,033 --> 00:52:29,867
God, they found me, all right! Look.

947
00:52:30,035 --> 00:52:31,368
Straight through my pants there.

948
00:52:32,971 --> 00:52:34,538
Stinging. And it hurts.

949
00:52:34,706 --> 00:52:35,606
They all sting.

950
00:52:35,774 --> 00:52:37,374
The interesting thing is they're all blind,

951
00:52:37,542 --> 00:52:39,877
but somehow they find me all right.

952
00:52:40,045 --> 00:52:41,345
Here we go. Bye-bye.

953
00:52:41,513 --> 00:52:44,181
Army ant colonies are so perfectly organized

954
00:52:44,349 --> 00:52:47,217
that they are sometimes
called vast superbugs.

955
00:52:47,385 --> 00:52:49,954
And I'm heading towards this one's heart.

956
00:52:50,121 --> 00:52:51,288
Ohh.

957
00:52:54,926 --> 00:52:56,894
The trail is over there.

958
00:52:57,062 --> 00:52:58,629
I have the feeling I'm close to the nest,

959
00:52:58,797 --> 00:53:01,265
because they're getting
really wide - the trails -

960
00:53:01,433 --> 00:53:02,967
and it's like a highway.

961
00:53:03,134 --> 00:53:05,102
So they're split up a bit further up.

962
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:06,370
The food is going that way,

963
00:53:06,538 --> 00:53:08,839
so I must be close to the bivouac.

964
00:53:09,007 --> 00:53:11,742
Really exciting stuff. Come on.

965
00:53:18,883 --> 00:53:21,118
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

966
00:53:21,286 --> 00:53:24,188
That's where they are. Ooh.

967
00:53:24,356 --> 00:53:25,823
Look at it.

968
00:53:25,991 --> 00:53:27,691
This is the bivouac.

969
00:53:27,692 --> 00:53:29,692
It's not a
structural subject,

970
00:53:29,693 --> 00:53:30,693
it's not a nest.

971
00:53:31,594 --> 00:53:34,395
It's basically,
a hell of all of ants...

972
00:53:34,396 --> 00:53:35,996
...all holding hands
together...

973
00:53:35,997 --> 00:53:38,247
...forming their
own nest.

974
00:53:39,009 --> 00:53:41,043
It's a bit like having
a whole family of human beings

975
00:53:41,211 --> 00:53:42,779
all handing hands and forming a house

976
00:53:42,946 --> 00:53:44,580
where the other human beings walk inside -

977
00:53:44,748 --> 00:53:46,249
on the staircase, going upstairs,

978
00:53:46,416 --> 00:53:47,650
going to the fridge.

979
00:53:47,818 --> 00:53:49,786
You know, find mum, find the kids.

980
00:53:50,921 --> 00:53:51,988
And there they are.

981
00:53:52,156 --> 00:53:55,625
This is, I would say,
a medium-sized nest.

982
00:53:55,793 --> 00:53:58,795
700,000 individuals. Something like that.

983
00:53:58,962 --> 00:54:04,033
This bivouac is part of a nomadic phase.

984
00:54:04,201 --> 00:54:07,136
What I'm trying to say is that
these ants are on the move.

985
00:54:07,304 --> 00:54:11,440
The workers move their camp,
or bivouac, every day.

986
00:54:11,608 --> 00:54:12,809
As they take the queen

987
00:54:12,976 --> 00:54:15,878
and thousands of helpless larvae and pupae

988
00:54:16,046 --> 00:54:17,980
to a new feeding location,

989
00:54:18,148 --> 00:54:20,950
big, well-armed soldiers guard them.

990
00:54:21,118 --> 00:54:22,618
During the nomadic phase,

991
00:54:22,786 --> 00:54:25,721
the colony is a bit like a ravenous beast.

992
00:54:25,889 --> 00:54:28,124
Its appetite is insatiable.

993
00:54:28,292 --> 00:54:34,630
Lizards, birds, even snakes fall prey
to this rampaging superbug.

994
00:54:34,798 --> 00:54:37,166
You know what I reckon is going to be fun?

995
00:54:37,334 --> 00:54:39,268
Going to the front of the column.

996
00:54:39,436 --> 00:54:42,238
That is the swarm.
That's where the action is.

997
00:54:42,406 --> 00:54:44,473
That's the battlefield.

998
00:54:46,743 --> 00:54:50,179
The swarm will move out
in a new direction every day.

999
00:54:50,347 --> 00:54:51,347
There are no scouts.

1000
00:54:51,515 --> 00:54:53,115
And because they're all blind,

1001
00:54:53,283 --> 00:54:55,785
they follow a pheromone or scent trail

1002
00:54:55,953 --> 00:54:58,221
laid down by the workers.

1003
00:55:01,925 --> 00:55:04,360
Army ants sometimes enter our world.

1004
00:55:04,528 --> 00:55:05,695
And when they do,

1005
00:55:05,863 --> 00:55:08,898
you can clearly see how
totally organized they are.

1006
00:55:08,899 --> 00:55:10,799
It's like traffic
on a freeway.

1007
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,100
Except there is no accidents
and no traffic jams.

1008
00:55:22,508 --> 00:55:24,743
Now, this is something
you don't see every day-

1009
00:55:24,911 --> 00:55:28,613
army ants invading homes
which are close to the jungle.

1010
00:55:28,781 --> 00:55:31,116
Now, the locals don't mind that too much

1011
00:55:31,284 --> 00:55:34,820
because the army ants perform
a gratis service of pest control.

1012
00:55:34,987 --> 00:55:36,288
They're taking away all the vermin,

1013
00:55:36,456 --> 00:55:38,557
all the insects that
they don't want in their pantries,

1014
00:55:38,724 --> 00:55:41,393
in their kitchens, in their bedrooms.

1015
00:55:42,462 --> 00:55:44,830
Workers are voracious.

1016
00:55:44,997 --> 00:55:46,531
When they detect prey,

1017
00:55:46,699 --> 00:55:50,735
they become like a pack of tiny wolves.

1018
00:55:53,272 --> 00:55:56,441
But the colony concentrates
most of its killing power

1019
00:55:56,609 --> 00:55:58,276
at the front of the swarm.

1020
00:55:58,444 --> 00:56:02,581
This is like the mouth of a fierce predator.

1021
00:56:03,549 --> 00:56:05,951
I'm literally at the front of the column.

1022
00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:08,587
This is where the swarm is.
And they're everywhere.

1023
00:56:08,754 --> 00:56:10,288
There are big columns over there.

1024
00:56:11,357 --> 00:56:12,891
Huge numbers.

1025
00:56:13,059 --> 00:56:14,493
And the funny thing is

1026
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:16,728
they really don't make tracks, as such.

1027
00:56:16,896 --> 00:56:19,998
They literally swarm all over the place.

1028
00:56:20,166 --> 00:56:23,101
At the leading edge,
ants push forward.

1029
00:56:23,269 --> 00:56:26,304
They lay pheromone
for others and then retreat.

1030
00:56:26,472 --> 00:56:29,541
Any prey is heavily marked with pheromone

1031
00:56:29,709 --> 00:56:32,244
and swarmed by those that follow.

1032
00:56:32,411 --> 00:56:34,946
If the kill is too big to move,
they cut it up

1033
00:56:35,114 --> 00:56:38,350
and hundreds of ants each carry a piece back

1034
00:56:38,518 --> 00:56:41,486
along the feeder column to the bivouac.

1035
00:56:43,256 --> 00:56:46,191
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow,
ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

1036
00:56:46,359 --> 00:56:48,426
Now, if the front of the swarm

1037
00:56:48,594 --> 00:56:50,862
is like the mouth of a fierce predator,

1038
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:53,798
I could easily become its next meal.

1039
00:56:53,966 --> 00:56:56,668
Ow, ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow! Don't do that.

1040
00:56:56,836 --> 00:56:58,703
Oil! Stop.

1041
00:56:58,871 --> 00:57:01,306
I'm in the wrong place.
I'm in the wrong place.

1042
00:57:01,374 --> 00:57:02,807
I'm in the wrong place.

1043
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:03,975
Oh, no!

1044
00:57:04,143 --> 00:57:05,810
Army ants hurt.

1045
00:57:05,978 --> 00:57:08,446
But next, an ant that can really hurt.

1046
00:57:08,614 --> 00:57:11,383
It has the most painful sting
in the animal kingdom.

1047
00:57:15,555 --> 00:57:17,389
The good news is this bug lives

1048
00:57:17,557 --> 00:57:19,791
in Central American forest treetops,

1049
00:57:19,959 --> 00:57:21,826
so I get a ride in a crane.

1050
00:57:21,994 --> 00:57:24,763
The bad news is that
it has a really painful sting,

1051
00:57:24,931 --> 00:57:26,932
and I've agreed to experience it.

1052
00:57:28,067 --> 00:57:29,568
Far out.

1053
00:57:29,735 --> 00:57:32,671
To forget that I'm about to get a bad sting,

1054
00:57:32,838 --> 00:57:36,241
I'm really trying hard
to enjoy the view up here.

1055
00:57:36,409 --> 00:57:38,677
You can imagine that
the canopy of forests like this

1056
00:57:38,844 --> 00:57:40,278
have not been studied much in the past

1057
00:57:40,446 --> 00:57:42,080
because there's no way of getting there.

1058
00:57:42,248 --> 00:57:45,483
But once you get there,
boy, there's stuff everywhere.

1059
00:57:45,651 --> 00:57:48,220
Entomologist's dream.

1060
00:57:50,189 --> 00:57:52,490
Every tree you see here is different.

1061
00:57:52,658 --> 00:57:55,794
I mean, there's a home
for everybody here, literally.

1062
00:57:55,962 --> 00:57:56,962
And there's ants.

1063
00:57:57,129 --> 00:57:59,264
There's ants even at this elevation.

1064
00:57:59,432 --> 00:58:00,966
Where's my bullet ant?

1065
00:58:02,635 --> 00:58:05,237
I'm going to be stung by a bullet ant.

1066
00:58:05,404 --> 00:58:08,340
They live in colonies at the base of trees

1067
00:58:08,507 --> 00:58:13,478
but mainly feed on flowers and
nectar high up in the treetops.

1068
00:58:15,514 --> 00:58:17,115
Bullet ants are blind.

1069
00:58:17,283 --> 00:58:19,784
They use their antennae as walking sticks

1070
00:58:19,952 --> 00:58:21,886
as they move about up here.

1071
00:58:22,054 --> 00:58:23,555
And that's why they have a sting

1072
00:58:23,723 --> 00:58:27,058
that causes such incredible pain.

1073
00:58:27,994 --> 00:58:29,894
The only disadvantage of living up here is

1074
00:58:30,062 --> 00:58:31,396
you're in the public eye.

1075
00:58:31,564 --> 00:58:34,032
The stakes are really high here.

1076
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:37,235
All insects want to feed here,
and the predators know that,

1077
00:58:37,403 --> 00:58:40,672
because they go and hunt
for their favorite prey.

1078
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:43,241
And if you are a big insect
like a bullet ant,

1079
00:58:43,409 --> 00:58:45,176
you'll really want to arm yourself

1080
00:58:45,344 --> 00:58:47,379
so that those predators
don't stand a chance.

1081
00:58:47,546 --> 00:58:48,780
Hmm.

1082
00:58:49,915 --> 00:58:51,750
Worker ants travel alone.

1083
00:58:51,917 --> 00:58:53,985
Nothing will mess with you

1084
00:58:54,023 --> 00:58:56,488
when you've got a major sting
in the tip of your abdomen.

1085
00:58:58,658 --> 00:59:01,393
They say that being stung by a bullet ant

1086
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:03,261
feels like being shot.

1087
00:59:03,429 --> 00:59:06,464
And I'm about to find out.

1088
00:59:06,632 --> 00:59:08,566
Un poco.

1089
00:59:08,734 --> 00:59:10,769
Gracias, gracias, gracias.

1090
00:59:12,271 --> 00:59:14,806
There's heaps of ants here,
but it's the wrong size.

1091
00:59:14,974 --> 00:59:16,708
Look at them. Whoa!

1092
00:59:16,876 --> 00:59:19,778
They describe this ant
- the pain of this ant -

1093
00:59:19,945 --> 00:59:22,080
as if your hand is being
slammed in a car door

1094
00:59:22,248 --> 00:59:23,615
for a couple of hours.

1095
00:59:23,783 --> 00:59:25,483
Yeah.

1096
00:59:25,651 --> 00:59:27,585
So why am I doing it?

1097
00:59:27,753 --> 00:59:29,421
Well, the world's stinging insects -

1098
00:59:29,588 --> 00:59:31,956
bees, wasps, and ants - are all bluffers.

1099
00:59:32,124 --> 00:59:33,625
It's a painful bluff, mind you,

1100
00:59:33,793 --> 00:59:35,327
but the sting is simply their trick

1101
00:59:35,494 --> 00:59:38,063
to make us think that
we are suffering major injury.

1102
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:40,365
They really just want us to go away.

1103
00:59:40,533 --> 00:59:41,633
Even a bullet ant's sting

1104
00:59:41,801 --> 00:59:44,169
is nothing more than a painful sting.

1105
00:59:44,337 --> 00:59:46,471
Got it, got it. Nearly. Nearly got it.

1106
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:48,740
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

1107
00:59:49,642 --> 00:59:50,475
Yeah!

1108
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,880
I think I got one.

1109
00:59:57,316 --> 00:59:58,683
Now I'm going to take that ant

1110
00:59:58,851 --> 01:00:00,952
and see what it's really made of.

1111
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,887
Here we go.

1112
01:00:03,055 --> 01:00:06,324
This is the bullet ant
I got up in the canopy.

1113
01:00:06,492 --> 01:00:08,159
And I'm going to bite the bullet.

1114
01:00:08,327 --> 01:00:12,364
I'm gonna see if it's really
all it's cracked up to be.

1115
01:00:12,531 --> 01:00:14,666
Come on, mate. Down you go.
I don't want you out there yet.

1116
01:00:14,834 --> 01:00:16,034
I'll put it on my arm here.

1117
01:00:16,202 --> 01:00:17,802
Aah, he got me! Got me, got me, got me.

1118
01:00:17,970 --> 01:00:19,137
Get out. Get the sting out.

1119
01:00:19,305 --> 01:00:20,372
Come on, come on. Off you go.

1120
01:00:20,539 --> 01:00:21,573
Please get off me.

1121
01:00:21,741 --> 01:00:23,074
He keeps going, keeps going. Hang on.

1122
01:00:23,242 --> 01:00:24,776
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

1123
01:00:24,944 --> 01:00:26,277
Aah! Come here.

1124
01:00:26,445 --> 01:00:29,647
I'll get you anyway. Oh!

1125
01:00:29,815 --> 01:00:32,250
You can see how my watch is getting really -

1126
01:00:32,418 --> 01:00:34,552
See how it's swelling up
on either side of my watch.

1127
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,122
I'm gonna take it off because
it's not doing anything for me.

1128
01:00:37,289 --> 01:00:38,289
Can you see that?

1129
01:00:38,457 --> 01:00:40,458
They call it the 24-hour ant.

1130
01:00:40,626 --> 01:00:43,128
And that means that
they reckon that 24 hours,

1131
01:00:43,295 --> 01:00:44,929
the pain will subside.

1132
01:00:45,097 --> 01:00:47,399
It's like slowly creeping
through my arm now.

1133
01:00:47,566 --> 01:00:50,668
It's starting to move.
It's now moving towards my hand.

1134
01:00:50,836 --> 01:00:52,604
The pain is moving further up my arm.

1135
01:00:52,772 --> 01:00:54,305
And it took, what, 20 minutes.

1136
01:00:54,473 --> 01:00:57,909
Boy, this is something
I will never, ever forget.

1137
01:00:58,077 --> 01:00:59,477
Never, ever.

1138
01:00:59,645 --> 01:01:03,014
We're an hour after the sting occurred.

1139
01:01:03,182 --> 01:01:05,483
The pain has absolutely not subsided.

1140
01:01:05,651 --> 01:01:08,420
It's like a hot needle in
and down on either side.

1141
01:01:08,587 --> 01:01:10,422
It's started to really rain heavily.

1142
01:01:10,589 --> 01:01:13,224
It's got really dark.
It's almost like midnight.

1143
01:01:13,392 --> 01:01:17,128
And I think it's time to retire
to the comfort of my hotel,

1144
01:01:17,296 --> 01:01:20,398
where there might be some ice,
which would be good.

1145
01:01:20,566 --> 01:01:22,400
Boy, this is sore. Still.

1146
01:01:22,568 --> 01:01:25,370
It doesn't go away. It keeps going.

1147
01:01:29,875 --> 01:01:31,810
It's about six hours after the sting,

1148
01:01:31,977 --> 01:01:33,845
and it just doesn't let up.

1149
01:01:34,013 --> 01:01:35,380
It's really painful.

1150
01:01:35,548 --> 01:01:37,081
It's not getting much better, really.

1151
01:01:37,249 --> 01:01:39,684
It's just, like, swollen.

1152
01:01:39,852 --> 01:01:41,753
Sore from here to there.

1153
01:01:41,921 --> 01:01:44,923
My arm, when I don't move it,
is totally numb.

1154
01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:47,492
It's thick, and you cannot move much.

1155
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:50,295
It's very thick and fat inside.

1156
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:53,331
It doesn't really hurt much
until you start moving it.

1157
01:01:53,499 --> 01:01:55,533
Then it starts to hurt again.

1158
01:01:59,672 --> 01:02:00,738
Morning.

1159
01:02:00,906 --> 01:02:03,575
Just had a few hours' sleep,
which is nice, actually.

1160
01:02:03,742 --> 01:02:06,778
And we're 16 hours on, after the sting.

1161
01:02:06,946 --> 01:02:08,847
And good news is, I can wear my watch.

1162
01:02:09,014 --> 01:02:10,181
The swelling has gone down.

1163
01:02:10,349 --> 01:02:17,288
The pain is basically back
to the aftermath numbness of a big beesting.

1164
01:02:17,456 --> 01:02:20,525
And that means that
I'm on the road to recovery.

1165
01:02:20,693 --> 01:02:22,160
I think I shall live.

1166
01:02:22,328 --> 01:02:25,830
I learned a lesson.
I really - I really did.

1167
01:02:25,998 --> 01:02:30,301
Don't mess with bullet ants.
They pack a punch.

1168
01:02:37,142 --> 01:02:39,177
My search for the baddest bugs

1169
01:02:39,345 --> 01:02:41,880
takes me deep into the Arizona desert.

1170
01:02:42,047 --> 01:02:45,083
This is scorpion HQ.

1171
01:02:45,251 --> 01:02:48,286
Here are two toughies - two scorpions -

1172
01:02:48,454 --> 01:02:50,321
and both are from the desert.

1173
01:02:50,489 --> 01:02:52,991
Now, one of these is a killer.

1174
01:02:53,158 --> 01:02:56,327
It can floor and kill human beings.

1175
01:02:56,495 --> 01:02:59,197
And the other one is almost harmless.

1176
01:02:59,365 --> 01:03:01,499
Can you guess which one?

1177
01:03:01,667 --> 01:03:03,902
No? I'll show you.

1178
01:03:08,007 --> 01:03:08,907
This one...

1179
01:03:09,074 --> 01:03:11,442
Aah!

1180
01:03:11,610 --> 01:03:14,312
This one is the harmless one.

1181
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,281
Oh, yes, it just got me.

1182
01:03:16,448 --> 01:03:18,449
Absolutely got me. And it draws blood.

1183
01:03:18,617 --> 01:03:21,953
But the venom is not
half as bad as that of a bee.

1184
01:03:22,121 --> 01:03:23,721
She's so strong

1185
01:03:23,889 --> 01:03:27,425
that she would rarely use
her sting for catching prey.

1186
01:03:27,593 --> 01:03:30,261
She would use it only really
in the last possible defense

1187
01:03:30,429 --> 01:03:31,563
if somebody is hassling her

1188
01:03:31,730 --> 01:03:33,164
or if she feels really threatened.

1189
01:03:33,332 --> 01:03:34,699
A little bit like this. Look.

1190
01:03:34,867 --> 01:03:36,200
See, there it goes.

1191
01:03:36,368 --> 01:03:37,769
Aah, yeah. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1192
01:03:37,937 --> 01:03:39,771
She's pushing. She's nudging.

1193
01:03:39,939 --> 01:03:40,905
Look at that.

1194
01:03:41,073 --> 01:03:43,441
And the funny thing is it doesn't even hurt.

1195
01:03:43,609 --> 01:03:46,878
Now, the other one, that's the nasty one.

1196
01:03:47,046 --> 01:03:49,247
And there's a very good reason for it.

1197
01:03:50,416 --> 01:03:55,253
The bark scorpion hunts out on tree trunks
and rocks where it can be seen

1198
01:03:55,421 --> 01:03:57,922
and is vulnerable to attack,
just like the bullet ant.

1199
01:03:58,090 --> 01:03:59,591
So it uses venom,

1200
01:03:59,758 --> 01:04:05,263
not only to catch prey but also
for defense against predators.

1201
01:04:05,431 --> 01:04:08,099
My TV crew has rigged
another surprise for me.

1202
01:04:08,267 --> 01:04:11,002
I'm not sure what a walk
on the beach will teach me

1203
01:04:11,170 --> 01:04:15,573
about bark scorpion stings,
but I'm sure I'll find out.

1204
01:04:15,741 --> 01:04:18,943
For this simple demonstration
about the bark scorpion,

1205
01:04:19,111 --> 01:04:22,714
I was asked to walk past that girl
on the beach there.

1206
01:04:23,781 --> 01:04:25,549
How easy can that be?

1207
01:04:34,359 --> 01:04:36,126
Aah! Oh!

1208
01:04:36,294 --> 01:04:37,594
That's nasty.

1209
01:04:37,762 --> 01:04:39,930
Aah! Oh!

1210
01:04:40,098 --> 01:04:42,299
Aah! Oh! Aah.

1211
01:04:42,467 --> 01:04:44,768
What is that? It's so small.

1212
01:04:44,936 --> 01:04:46,403
Oh, that's a cattle prod.

1213
01:04:46,571 --> 01:04:48,639
Look, that's 10,000 volts or something.

1214
01:04:48,806 --> 01:04:50,207
Shall I'll get you? Go.

1215
01:04:50,375 --> 01:04:51,408
Good grief!

1216
01:04:51,576 --> 01:04:53,977
Oh, not fair.

1217
01:04:54,145 --> 01:04:56,580
Shows you, though,
if you're small in stature,

1218
01:04:56,748 --> 01:04:59,216
and you've got something
that is really worthwhile as a tool,

1219
01:04:59,384 --> 01:05:01,351
you can floor anybody.

1220
01:05:04,852 --> 01:05:08,852
The little black scorpion's powerful
punch is a neurotoxin venom...

1221
01:05:08,853 --> 01:05:12,153
...that's killed hundreds of people
in Mexico and in US.

1222
01:05:13,154 --> 01:05:16,304
Some scorpions can decide
how bad they want to be.

1223
01:05:16,305 --> 01:05:19,605
Some of two kinds of venomed
one just causes pain.

1224
01:05:19,606 --> 01:05:24,106
But, if the treat continues,
they will turn on deadly venom.

1225
01:05:25,707 --> 01:05:27,307
As our towns move
into the deserts,

1226
01:05:27,308 --> 01:05:28,907
we meet more scorpions...

1227
01:05:28,908 --> 01:05:32,008
...and another bug that likes to
join us in the bathroom.

1228
01:05:35,309 --> 01:05:37,509
As American settlers
moved west,

1229
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:40,010
built homes
on the desert,

1230
01:05:40,511 --> 01:05:42,911
the deadly black widow
moved in with them.

1231
01:05:44,012 --> 01:05:48,512
It had a fatal attraction to the
smallest room around the house.

1232
01:05:49,513 --> 01:05:50,513
The outhouse.

1233
01:05:55,292 --> 01:05:58,428
The relationship between
man and bugs has never been,

1234
01:05:58,596 --> 01:06:00,563
shall we say, a comfortable one.

1235
01:06:00,731 --> 01:06:02,498
And especially the black widow spider's

1236
01:06:02,666 --> 01:06:06,135
left a trail of victims and destruction.

1237
01:06:08,172 --> 01:06:10,373
Ewwww!

1238
01:06:10,541 --> 01:06:13,776
What a top spot for a spider
to hang out.

1239
01:06:13,944 --> 01:06:17,180
It's got everything
a decent black widow would want.

1240
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:18,681
Now, for these spiders,

1241
01:06:18,849 --> 01:06:20,483
outdoor toilets were merely the beginning

1242
01:06:20,651 --> 01:06:22,652
of their long association with humans.

1243
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:24,687
I reckon they went a couple of steps further

1244
01:06:24,855 --> 01:06:27,924
and are now saying,
"Modern cities and urban habitats?

1245
01:06:28,092 --> 01:06:29,893
Bring it on!"

1246
01:06:31,428 --> 01:06:33,897
Many towns and cities have now spread across

1247
01:06:34,064 --> 01:06:35,932
a lot of black widow territory.

1248
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:38,167
And that spells danger for us.

1249
01:06:38,335 --> 01:06:40,803
In the last 25 years
there have been numerous

1250
01:06:40,971 --> 01:06:42,739
black widow spider bites reported

1251
01:06:42,907 --> 01:06:46,342
but, thankfully, only four confirmed deaths.

1252
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:49,812
It's the female of the species
who's the bad bug,

1253
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:53,149
and I'm keen to meet the lady up close.

1254
01:06:53,317 --> 01:06:56,552
This is what I call
a prime piece of real estate.

1255
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,154
There she is in an old clay pot.

1256
01:06:58,322 --> 01:07:00,256
Nice and sheltered. Big web.

1257
01:07:00,424 --> 01:07:02,458
And, of course, in an area
with a lot of rubbish.

1258
01:07:02,626 --> 01:07:04,761
A lot of other insects. A lot of flies.

1259
01:07:04,828 --> 01:07:05,762
A lot of food.

1260
01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:08,231
She sits in the back of the pot, waiting.

1261
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:10,500
The web is right out here.

1262
01:07:10,668 --> 01:07:12,702
In the web there's some
other little bits and pieces.

1263
01:07:12,870 --> 01:07:15,772
There's some food hanging
in suspended animation right here.

1264
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:18,408
Little fly covered with silk.

1265
01:07:18,575 --> 01:07:20,977
Now, we all know that they're venomous.

1266
01:07:21,145 --> 01:07:25,181
But the reason they use
their venom is very, very simple.

1267
01:07:25,349 --> 01:07:28,217
You see, spiders haven't invented
fridges yet.

1268
01:07:28,385 --> 01:07:29,652
So when they catch prey,

1269
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:32,021
they want to keep it as fresh as possible

1270
01:07:32,189 --> 01:07:33,957
if they don't want to feed on it yet.

1271
01:07:34,124 --> 01:07:36,492
So what you do is you wrap it up into silk,

1272
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:38,394
you give it a little bite of venom,

1273
01:07:38,562 --> 01:07:41,664
a little bit of poison so that
you just don't kill your prey,

1274
01:07:41,832 --> 01:07:45,134
and it stays okay in the web
for four or five days.

1275
01:07:48,005 --> 01:07:50,673
Perhaps black widows are supervenomous

1276
01:07:50,841 --> 01:07:52,875
because they are small and vulnerable,

1277
01:07:53,043 --> 01:07:56,045
just like bullet ants and bark scorpions.

1278
01:07:56,213 --> 01:07:58,748
But the good news is that, like all spiders,

1279
01:07:58,916 --> 01:08:01,784
they really don't want to bite us.

1280
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:07,690
Now, black widows are normally
not very aggressive at all.

1281
01:08:07,858 --> 01:08:09,425
But you've got to be very careful.

1282
01:08:09,593 --> 01:08:11,961
They are venomous.
And don't try this at home.

1283
01:08:12,129 --> 01:08:15,398
But when you get a spider
like this that falls onto your hand

1284
01:08:15,566 --> 01:08:18,234
or bungees onto your hand,
don't pick it up.

1285
01:08:18,402 --> 01:08:20,069
Put it back just like that,

1286
01:08:20,237 --> 01:08:21,344
and put it back
where she belongs.

1287
01:08:21,345 --> 01:08:23,006
And she believe
you're alone.

1288
01:08:24,707 --> 01:08:28,207
Mother black widow lays
several egg clusters in a season.

1289
01:08:28,858 --> 01:08:33,558
But newly hetched black widow spiderlings
have a clever way of going new places...

1290
01:08:33,559 --> 01:08:35,159
...where had meeting
you people.

1291
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:38,410
They climb up to
a windy side,

1292
01:08:39,011 --> 01:08:40,811
make a long piece of sac...

1293
01:08:41,162 --> 01:08:44,462
...use it like a parachute
to take the disguise.

1294
01:08:45,363 --> 01:08:47,363
I can't believe.

1295
01:08:49,714 --> 01:08:53,114
They can blow from miles and miles
and whereever they land...

1296
01:08:53,115 --> 01:08:54,265
...it could be a forest,

1297
01:08:54,266 --> 01:08:55,766
an office building,

1298
01:08:55,767 --> 01:08:57,367
or your backyard,

1299
01:08:57,468 --> 01:09:00,468
that will be the widows
you home.

1300
01:09:05,119 --> 01:09:08,519
A black widow spider
isn't really as bad as its reputaion,

1301
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:12,020
but next, the most deadly
spider in the world.

1302
01:09:24,884 --> 01:09:28,720
Look at this - a bustling metropolis
with lots of activity

1303
01:09:28,888 --> 01:09:29,922
and heaps of people.

1304
01:09:30,089 --> 01:09:31,356
4 million, in fact.

1305
01:09:31,524 --> 01:09:33,826
Because this is Sydney, Australia.

1306
01:09:33,993 --> 01:09:37,329
Now, let's take a step back
in time 300 years.

1307
01:09:38,331 --> 01:09:39,932
Ah, that's better.

1308
01:09:40,099 --> 01:09:42,835
Clean, pristine, undisturbed bush.

1309
01:09:43,002 --> 01:09:44,670
Now, it was in this particular area,

1310
01:09:44,838 --> 01:09:47,673
perhaps only a couple of
dozen square miles in size,

1311
01:09:47,841 --> 01:09:51,643
that there once lived
a very unique species of spider -

1312
01:09:51,811 --> 01:09:53,612
a funnel-web spider.

1313
01:09:54,414 --> 01:09:56,315
On warm summer evenings,

1314
01:09:56,482 --> 01:09:59,451
male funnel-webs would
come out of their silk-lined nests

1315
01:09:59,619 --> 01:10:02,588
and go wandering through
the bush looking for a mate.

1316
01:10:08,528 --> 01:10:11,697
Their journeys could take them
miles from home.

1317
01:10:11,865 --> 01:10:17,269
And that's the way life was
for perhaps millions of years.

1318
01:10:17,437 --> 01:10:19,671
And then...

1319
01:10:19,839 --> 01:10:23,108
200 years ago, the city of Sydney was built

1320
01:10:23,276 --> 01:10:26,545
right on top of funnel-web
spiders' home territory.

1321
01:10:26,713 --> 01:10:29,681
So, what did these spiders do?

1322
01:10:29,849 --> 01:10:31,183
Well, nothing.

1323
01:10:31,351 --> 01:10:34,353
The males keep on wandering,
just like they always did.

1324
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,555
Now known as the Sydney funnel-web,

1325
01:10:36,723 --> 01:10:38,824
the suburbs are their new bush.

1326
01:10:38,992 --> 01:10:41,793
And if their romantic journey
should take them near a house,

1327
01:10:41,961 --> 01:10:44,329
they are likely to come in.

1328
01:10:44,497 --> 01:10:45,998
Trouble is,

1329
01:10:46,165 --> 01:10:50,202
they're probably the most
venomous spiders on the planet.

1330
01:10:50,370 --> 01:10:52,938
When cornered,
they can be really aggressive,

1331
01:10:53,106 --> 01:10:56,074
and 13 people have been
killed in the Sydney area -

1332
01:10:56,242 --> 01:10:59,778
but none since antivenin
was discovered in 1981,

1333
01:10:59,946 --> 01:11:03,749
even though 30 to 40 people
are bitten each year.

1334
01:11:04,584 --> 01:11:06,919
They normally eat beetles and cockroaches,

1335
01:11:07,086 --> 01:11:08,754
so it's actually quite a mystery

1336
01:11:08,922 --> 01:11:12,157
why the venom of male
funnel-webs is so poisonous...

1337
01:11:12,325 --> 01:11:14,993
...to humans and other primates.

1338
01:11:15,161 --> 01:11:18,263
I've caught one in the act here
in the old garage,

1339
01:11:18,431 --> 01:11:20,132
walking around.

1340
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:21,700
Can't stay here, mate.

1341
01:11:24,537 --> 01:11:27,506
Some of them are more
aggressive than others.

1342
01:11:27,674 --> 01:11:31,009
If they rear up, you know
they mean business.

1343
01:11:31,177 --> 01:11:35,280
You have to be very careful
with puffs of wind.

1344
01:11:41,054 --> 01:11:43,055
This is rearing behavior.

1345
01:11:43,222 --> 01:11:48,260
Universal language for
"Danger - Stay out of my way. "

1346
01:11:48,428 --> 01:11:51,663
I'm gonna try something here.

1347
01:11:51,831 --> 01:11:53,282
I've got a theory that...

1348
01:11:53,283 --> 01:11:57,636
...a spider just doesn't bite
the ground that it's walking on.

1349
01:11:57,804 --> 01:12:01,106
It's got to have a good reason
to be aggressive and to attack

1350
01:12:01,274 --> 01:12:04,710
if it's under attack itself.

1351
01:12:04,877 --> 01:12:08,080
I'm gonna try and let it walk over my hand.

1352
01:12:09,816 --> 01:12:11,483
I think.

1353
01:12:13,953 --> 01:12:17,856
This, believe it or not,
is not an act of foolishness.

1354
01:12:18,024 --> 01:12:19,424
Ah, look at it.

1355
01:12:19,592 --> 01:12:22,728
I've handled bugs, good
and bad, for over 20 years.

1356
01:12:22,895 --> 01:12:24,262
I know when it is safe.

1357
01:12:24,430 --> 01:12:28,367
And I know that venom
is precious to a spider.

1358
01:12:28,534 --> 01:12:30,469
They don't want to waste a drop.

1359
01:12:30,636 --> 01:12:33,271
And they will only attack when threatened.

1360
01:12:33,439 --> 01:12:35,874
Ooh, that was close.

1361
01:12:36,042 --> 01:12:37,542
Ugh.

1362
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:39,144
God, I don't believe I did that.

1363
01:12:43,583 --> 01:12:45,384
But please, if you live in Sydney

1364
01:12:45,551 --> 01:12:50,222
or anywhere there are venomous
spiders, don't you try this.

1365
01:13:00,634 --> 01:13:04,069
My journey to find
the baddest bugs enters a swamp.

1366
01:13:04,237 --> 01:13:06,939
This could be anywhere in the tropics.

1367
01:13:07,107 --> 01:13:08,807
I'm Ruud Kleinpaste, and I'm on the trail

1368
01:13:08,975 --> 01:13:11,110
of a bug that's so unbelievably bad,

1369
01:13:11,278 --> 01:13:16,682
it can be linked to the deaths of millions
of humans in the last thousand years.

1370
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:19,151
I think I can hear something.

1371
01:13:19,319 --> 01:13:20,753
Yeah.

1372
01:13:23,290 --> 01:13:25,357
It hasn't found me yet.

1373
01:13:29,796 --> 01:13:32,565
These bad bugs love to feed on us,

1374
01:13:32,732 --> 01:13:37,469
and they can find us
from a long way off by smell.

1375
01:13:37,637 --> 01:13:39,838
Of course, I'm talking about mosquitoes,

1376
01:13:40,006 --> 01:13:41,707
and these ones are in the laboratory,

1377
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:44,476
where researchers use
a special machine to study

1378
01:13:44,644 --> 01:13:48,013
what kind of smells mosquitoes
are most attracted to.

1379
01:13:48,181 --> 01:13:49,415
This is how it works.

1380
01:13:49,583 --> 01:13:51,417
Lots of mosquitoes in these containers,

1381
01:13:51,585 --> 01:13:54,553
and some pipes and tubes
in which you can put an attractant,

1382
01:13:54,721 --> 01:13:56,322
and then you can measure the response.

1383
01:13:56,489 --> 01:14:01,193
Number one, I know breath
attracts them - carbon dioxide.

1384
01:14:01,361 --> 01:14:04,096
I've got a sachet of
artificial carbon dioxide here,

1385
01:14:04,264 --> 01:14:06,498
which I'm going to put in this chamber.

1386
01:14:06,666 --> 01:14:08,300
Upsy-daisy you are.

1387
01:14:08,468 --> 01:14:10,569
See what happens.

1388
01:14:11,371 --> 01:14:14,173
And there they go,
straight for the carbon dioxide.

1389
01:14:14,341 --> 01:14:15,874
It really turns them on.

1390
01:14:16,042 --> 01:14:20,012
If I would go "hoo!"
and breathe a bit more...

1391
01:14:20,847 --> 01:14:22,314
...they would even like that better.

1392
01:14:22,482 --> 01:14:23,716
So breath.

1393
01:14:23,883 --> 01:14:25,417
This is another one.

1394
01:14:25,585 --> 01:14:29,655
I put my hand in here, open that one up.

1395
01:14:29,823 --> 01:14:31,757
This shows you that
the chemicals on my hand -

1396
01:14:31,925 --> 01:14:35,527
the sweat and the body odors -
are also a very good stimulant

1397
01:14:35,695 --> 01:14:39,598
for those female mosquitoes
to grab me, to get hold of me.

1398
01:14:39,766 --> 01:14:41,667
But I've got something else.

1399
01:14:44,170 --> 01:14:47,573
I've got the odor of all odors.

1400
01:14:47,741 --> 01:14:49,508
I haven't washed those for a couple of days,

1401
01:14:49,676 --> 01:14:51,677
so I hope it's not going to kill them.

1402
01:14:53,713 --> 01:14:55,014
No, it doesn't.

1403
01:14:55,181 --> 01:14:57,282
They're actually -

1404
01:14:57,450 --> 01:14:59,785
They really like this stuff.
Isn't that amazing?

1405
01:14:59,953 --> 01:15:01,920
It's like Swiss cheese to a mosquito -

1406
01:15:02,088 --> 01:15:04,156
big foot odor, big sweat.

1407
01:15:04,324 --> 01:15:06,125
Mmm!

1408
01:15:06,292 --> 01:15:09,261
Only female mosquitoes come after us.

1409
01:15:09,429 --> 01:15:10,963
They want the protein in our blood

1410
01:15:11,131 --> 01:15:13,465
to help develop their eggs.

1411
01:15:16,102 --> 01:15:17,102
They find us first

1412
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:20,139
by locking on the carbon dioxide
in our breath.

1413
01:15:20,306 --> 01:15:23,108
They can detect us from over 100 feet away.

1414
01:15:24,644 --> 01:15:27,179
When they get closer, they smell our skin.

1415
01:15:27,347 --> 01:15:31,283
Mosquitoes react to over
300 different skin chemicals.

1416
01:15:31,451 --> 01:15:33,752
And, look, there they are,
going straight for my fingers.

1417
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:38,824
These mosquitoes can take four times
their own body weight of my blood.

1418
01:15:38,992 --> 01:15:41,193
That means that they become
four times heavier...

1419
01:15:41,361 --> 01:15:42,895
...than they are when they started.

1420
01:15:43,063 --> 01:15:46,198
And that means that their abdomens
really have to stretch

1421
01:15:46,366 --> 01:15:49,234
and let in more and more blood.

1422
01:15:49,402 --> 01:15:50,936
And if you look really carefully,

1423
01:15:51,104 --> 01:15:53,639
you can see that they eject water

1424
01:15:53,807 --> 01:15:56,341
with little droplets from their abdomen,

1425
01:15:56,509 --> 01:15:57,976
just to make room for a bit more blood.

1426
01:15:58,144 --> 01:16:02,414
They really want as much
protein as they can get.

1427
01:16:02,582 --> 01:16:05,284
Different mosquitoes
have favorite animal hosts.

1428
01:16:05,452 --> 01:16:08,921
These striped Aedes aegyptii
love human blood.

1429
01:16:09,089 --> 01:16:12,124
They live in the tropics
and like to live in our houses.

1430
01:16:12,292 --> 01:16:13,258
Problem is,

1431
01:16:13,426 --> 01:16:17,930
each one is a potentially
loaded gun full of nasty disease.

1432
01:16:18,098 --> 01:16:19,998
So am I in danger?

1433
01:16:20,166 --> 01:16:22,835
Thankfully, not from these little ladies.

1434
01:16:23,002 --> 01:16:26,338
They are laboratory-bred and disease-free.

1435
01:16:26,506 --> 01:16:28,974
But you can imagine that,
if these would have...

1436
01:16:29,142 --> 01:16:32,111
...things like yellow fever
or dengue inside them,

1437
01:16:32,278 --> 01:16:33,712
I would be a sitting duck.

1438
01:16:34,981 --> 01:16:37,950
Aedes mosquitoes spread
yellow fever and dengue fever

1439
01:16:38,118 --> 01:16:40,686
by sucking up disease
from the blood of an infected person

1440
01:16:40,854 --> 01:16:43,288
and passing it on to others.

1441
01:16:43,456 --> 01:16:45,791
The disease multiplies in a new host,

1442
01:16:45,959 --> 01:16:49,361
rupturing red blood cells
and causing severe fever -

1443
01:16:49,529 --> 01:16:54,700
fever that affects millions and
kills thousands of people each year.

1444
01:16:56,035 --> 01:16:59,404
Next, a bug that wants
to hurt us in a big way.

1445
01:17:05,712 --> 01:17:07,045
The baddest bugs in this show

1446
01:17:07,213 --> 01:17:09,548
were bred in Brazil in the 1950s.

1447
01:17:09,716 --> 01:17:13,452
They escaped and reached the U.S. in 1990,

1448
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:15,954
and they're spreading fast.

1449
01:17:16,122 --> 01:17:19,124
They're Africanized honeybees,
or killer bees.

1450
01:17:19,292 --> 01:17:21,326
They look just like normal honeybees,

1451
01:17:21,494 --> 01:17:24,863
but they are superaggressive
in defense of their queen.

1452
01:17:25,031 --> 01:17:26,431
If an intruder comes near,

1453
01:17:26,599 --> 01:17:30,536
thousands of bees will attack
and give chase for over a mile.

1454
01:17:30,703 --> 01:17:35,474
Hundreds of people have been
killed by this modern bad bug.

1455
01:17:37,410 --> 01:17:40,078
You generally don't mess around
with killer bees, I was told.

1456
01:17:42,282 --> 01:17:46,585
And that means full suit and great care.

1457
01:17:46,753 --> 01:17:48,086
Ooh.

1458
01:17:49,088 --> 01:17:52,624
I'm in Arizona, and
killer-bee expert Justin Schmidt

1459
01:17:52,792 --> 01:17:54,660
is taking me to a killer-bee nest.

1460
01:17:54,828 --> 01:17:56,061
We must be careful.

1461
01:17:56,229 --> 01:17:59,064
Even a noise or vibration
could cause an attack.

1462
01:17:59,232 --> 01:18:02,668
And when killer bees attack,
most of the hive will swarm,

1463
01:18:02,836 --> 01:18:05,571
and I don't want that,
and Justin doesn't, either.

1464
01:18:05,738 --> 01:18:07,806
There it is, up there
- the killer-bee colony.

1465
01:18:07,974 --> 01:18:09,241
The less people, the better,

1466
01:18:09,409 --> 01:18:12,077
so I'm going to wish you
good luck and bon voyage.

1467
01:18:12,245 --> 01:18:13,245
Oh, thank you.

1468
01:18:13,413 --> 01:18:15,414
I'll need it. I'll be very careful.

1469
01:18:15,582 --> 01:18:16,949
See ya.

1470
01:18:18,885 --> 01:18:20,052
Must be careful.

1471
01:18:24,724 --> 01:18:28,460
There's a huge nest of killer bees there.

1472
01:18:28,628 --> 01:18:32,931
And you - you can hear them
buzz from right here.

1473
01:18:33,099 --> 01:18:35,367
Now, I don't want to disturb them,

1474
01:18:35,535 --> 01:18:38,103
because when they're disturbed, they attack.

1475
01:18:38,271 --> 01:18:40,305
When they attack, they sting.

1476
01:18:40,473 --> 01:18:43,742
And when they sting, they die,
and I don't want that to happen.

1477
01:18:43,910 --> 01:18:46,545
But I've got to be very,
very quiet and very careful.

1478
01:18:46,713 --> 01:18:50,315
But what will be nice is
to have a look inside the nest

1479
01:18:50,483 --> 01:18:52,251
and to see how they react.

1480
01:18:52,418 --> 01:18:55,087
Don't forget, I'm downwind from them.

1481
01:18:55,255 --> 01:18:58,824
And I'm going to put
this little camera inside...

1482
01:19:00,093 --> 01:19:02,294
...and see what I can find.

1483
01:19:09,369 --> 01:19:11,637
Oh, boy, guard bees.

1484
01:19:11,804 --> 01:19:15,407
Oh, amazing, they haven't seen me yet.

1485
01:19:17,343 --> 01:19:19,945
Oh, sensational. This has
never been done before.

1486
01:19:20,113 --> 01:19:22,347
Oh, look, they're investigating
the camera now.

1487
01:19:22,515 --> 01:19:25,851
Wonderful!

1488
01:19:26,019 --> 01:19:27,853
Oh, God, the noise -
the noise.

1489
01:19:28,021 --> 01:19:30,889
Whoa, whoa, here they come.
I've got to get out, folks.

1490
01:19:31,057 --> 01:19:33,058
I've got to get out. No, this is not safe.

1491
01:19:33,226 --> 01:19:34,693
I've got to get out.

1492
01:19:36,596 --> 01:19:38,997
I'm on. I'm moving.

1493
01:19:42,201 --> 01:19:43,835
Better get out.

1494
01:19:45,338 --> 01:19:49,308
It's a bit safer here, but
I think I'll come back tonight.

1495
01:19:49,475 --> 01:19:52,344
I reckon it's a lot safer in the dark.

1496
01:19:58,384 --> 01:19:59,952
When I approach the nest at night,

1497
01:20:00,119 --> 01:20:03,422
I expect the bees to be at rest,
but they're not.

1498
01:20:03,589 --> 01:20:06,959
They are still aggressive
after my earlier visit.

1499
01:20:07,126 --> 01:20:11,563
As I approach, they approach me... on foot.

1500
01:20:11,731 --> 01:20:15,434
They climb my boots
and my legs. It's amazing.

1501
01:20:15,601 --> 01:20:16,802
Even though this is night,

1502
01:20:16,970 --> 01:20:20,872
they are still alert, still superaggressive.

1503
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:24,376
They start stinging.
It's time to get out of here.

1504
01:20:24,544 --> 01:20:27,112
But there will be no escape
from the killer bees

1505
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,647
tomorrow morning.

1506
01:20:32,654 --> 01:20:35,356
My journey to find the world's baddest bugs

1507
01:20:35,523 --> 01:20:38,926
ends here today in the Arizona desert.

1508
01:20:42,364 --> 01:20:44,298
I didn't sleep last night.

1509
01:20:44,466 --> 01:20:48,369
I kept thinking about
the crazy thing I've agreed to do.

1510
01:20:53,174 --> 01:20:55,409
Not too sure about this.

1511
01:20:58,179 --> 01:21:00,981
And it's hot already. I hope
the bees like the warmth.

1512
01:21:01,149 --> 01:21:03,384
Um, in there, I think.

1513
01:21:03,551 --> 01:21:06,153
I really am nervous. Hmm.

1514
01:21:06,321 --> 01:21:09,123
You'd be, too, if you were about to
have thousands of killer bees

1515
01:21:09,291 --> 01:21:11,325
put on you without any protective clothing.

1516
01:21:12,627 --> 01:21:14,361
Going to have an exciting day.

1517
01:21:14,529 --> 01:21:17,598
Hmm, this must be my torturer,
entomologist Norm Gary.

1518
01:21:17,766 --> 01:21:19,934
- Are you well?
- Hi. Norm.

1519
01:21:20,101 --> 01:21:22,403
Yeah, we're going to have
some excitement here.

1520
01:21:23,772 --> 01:21:25,072
I have no idea
what's gonna happen.

1521
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:26,307
So tell me, what do I do?

1522
01:21:26,474 --> 01:21:28,008
The first thing you do is not panic.

1523
01:21:28,176 --> 01:21:30,945
No matter what happens,
don't panic, because that's bad.

1524
01:21:31,112 --> 01:21:33,747
Okay, so, I reel- I - I - relax.

1525
01:21:33,915 --> 01:21:36,183
- You relax totally.
- As much as I can.

1526
01:21:36,351 --> 01:21:40,054
How can anyone relax with
50,000 bees on their face, eh?

1527
01:21:40,221 --> 01:21:41,188
Uh, how many?

1528
01:21:41,356 --> 01:21:44,358
Well, at least 50,000 bees are here today.

1529
01:21:44,526 --> 01:21:45,492
Okay.

1530
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:46,927
We hope they're all in a good mood.

1531
01:21:48,596 --> 01:21:50,164
Going to sting a lot, so...

1532
01:21:50,332 --> 01:21:52,633
He puts repellent around my eyes.

1533
01:21:52,801 --> 01:21:54,435
My sleeves and cuffs are taped

1534
01:21:54,602 --> 01:21:57,271
to prevent bees getting into
my clothing and stinging me.

1535
01:21:59,007 --> 01:22:00,641
Norm Gary is a bee expert

1536
01:22:00,809 --> 01:22:02,910
and has worked a lot with killer bees,

1537
01:22:03,078 --> 01:22:05,112
but what we are planning is very risky.

1538
01:22:06,915 --> 01:22:09,650
- This is a-
- Hey - I mean, hang on.

1539
01:22:09,818 --> 01:22:11,285
Is this it?

1540
01:22:11,453 --> 01:22:12,786
That's it, Ruud.

1541
01:22:12,954 --> 01:22:15,489
It's not beautiful, but it's functional.

1542
01:22:15,657 --> 01:22:17,558
This is a small vial of liquid.

1543
01:22:17,726 --> 01:22:20,594
It's a pheromone complex,
actually - many pheromones -

1544
01:22:20,762 --> 01:22:22,429
bee pheromones
combined together.

1545
01:22:22,597 --> 01:22:25,265
So, you can already see,
the bees are showing interest in it,

1546
01:22:25,433 --> 01:22:26,500
even before I open the vial.

1547
01:22:26,668 --> 01:22:27,368
Yes.

1548
01:22:27,535 --> 01:22:29,903
So in order to attract the bees to you

1549
01:22:30,071 --> 01:22:31,338
and get them to cluster on you,

1550
01:22:31,506 --> 01:22:33,574
we're going to place
little droplets of this

1551
01:22:33,742 --> 01:22:35,342
wherever we want the bees to come.

1552
01:22:35,510 --> 01:22:37,945
Wow, they're really responding.

1553
01:22:38,113 --> 01:22:39,546
Just little droplets here and there.

1554
01:22:39,714 --> 01:22:41,449
The pheromone is the key
to what we are going to do.

1555
01:22:41,917 --> 01:22:43,985
It's the same chemical that a queen produces

1556
01:22:44,152 --> 01:22:48,956
when she flies from an overcrowded hive
to encourage workers to follow her.

1557
01:22:49,124 --> 01:22:52,727
That's why they will come to me,
and that's why I'm doing this -

1558
01:22:52,895 --> 01:22:55,429
to prove the power of the pheromone.

1559
01:22:55,597 --> 01:22:58,432
I trust that it will communicate
to these killer bees

1560
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:00,568
that they should not attack me.

1561
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:01,836
Just to be on the safe side,

1562
01:23:02,004 --> 01:23:04,338
I have a fistful of medications here,

1563
01:23:04,506 --> 01:23:06,073
most anything for any purpose.

1564
01:23:06,241 --> 01:23:09,043
And we'll take good care of you
if you get stung.

1565
01:23:09,211 --> 01:23:11,279
Okay, so that's if I go absolutely out.

1566
01:23:11,446 --> 01:23:12,480
All right, are we ready?

1567
01:23:12,648 --> 01:23:14,148
- I'm ready, mate.
- Very good.

1568
01:23:16,084 --> 01:23:17,184
Ready?

1569
01:23:17,352 --> 01:23:19,287
Ready? Ready?

1570
01:23:19,454 --> 01:23:21,055
What am I doing here?

1571
01:23:27,829 --> 01:23:29,964
Once a few bees are in position,

1572
01:23:30,132 --> 01:23:32,867
then they are quite attracted
to the other bees.

1573
01:23:33,035 --> 01:23:38,906
So this is gonna build up now,
and it's going to alarm you.

1574
01:23:39,074 --> 01:23:40,441
There's no question about it.

1575
01:23:40,609 --> 01:23:44,078
What's even more alarming
is what Norm says next.

1576
01:23:44,246 --> 01:23:48,049
This is the first time I've ever used

1577
01:23:48,216 --> 01:23:51,752
Africanized, so-called killer bees,
on a person.

1578
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:54,722
As the bees go on, I start to panic.

1579
01:23:54,890 --> 01:23:57,258
500 stings will kill me,

1580
01:23:57,426 --> 01:24:00,227
and there must be close to
500 on me already.

1581
01:24:00,395 --> 01:24:04,365
But I must have confidence
in Norm and confidence in the bees.

1582
01:24:04,533 --> 01:24:06,701
I have to believe they only attack

1583
01:24:06,868 --> 01:24:09,203
if they have a queen or a hive to defend,

1584
01:24:09,371 --> 01:24:11,872
and today, I'm their queen.

1585
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:14,442
If you get stung,

1586
01:24:14,610 --> 01:24:16,043
I want you to let me know right away.

1587
01:24:16,211 --> 01:24:17,044
I will.

1588
01:24:17,212 --> 01:24:18,546
If you can't say anything with your mouth

1589
01:24:18,714 --> 01:24:21,549
because you're covered,
just go, "Ugh," like that.

1590
01:24:21,717 --> 01:24:23,584
When I first did this, I was terrified.

1591
01:24:23,752 --> 01:24:25,586
A sting is what I'm most afraid of.

1592
01:24:25,754 --> 01:24:30,291
If one killer bee stings,
it will release a sting pheromone.

1593
01:24:30,459 --> 01:24:32,593
That's the signal for a mass attack.

1594
01:24:33,862 --> 01:24:36,163
It is bizarre. It is a weird sensation.

1595
01:24:36,331 --> 01:24:39,400
It is frightening as hell.

1596
01:24:39,568 --> 01:24:42,069
It is really frightening, because you feel

1597
01:24:42,237 --> 01:24:45,106
that they're all going for you,
which is what they do.

1598
01:24:46,241 --> 01:24:48,776
Which is what they do,
isn't it, Norm? They go for me.

1599
01:24:48,944 --> 01:24:52,513
They're going for you because
you smell like the queen bee.

1600
01:24:52,681 --> 01:24:54,348
- Hmm.
- That's why. Yeah.

1601
01:24:54,516 --> 01:24:56,250
The biggest queen in town.

1602
01:24:56,418 --> 01:24:58,786
Oh, gosh!

1603
01:24:58,954 --> 01:25:00,955
It's hard to scoop the residual bees.

1604
01:25:01,123 --> 01:25:04,692
I'm going to fling them
in the air downwind from you,

1605
01:25:04,860 --> 01:25:06,227
and they will smell their way up

1606
01:25:06,395 --> 01:25:07,561
and come and join the other bees.

1607
01:25:07,729 --> 01:25:12,366
So, on the count of 3- 1... 2... 3.

1608
01:25:23,445 --> 01:25:25,079
How many more do you have?

1609
01:25:25,247 --> 01:25:28,249
Well, I would say,
maybe you have 30% of the -

1610
01:25:28,417 --> 01:25:29,216
Oh!

1611
01:25:29,384 --> 01:25:31,686
I can go ahead and
release the others quickly.

1612
01:25:31,853 --> 01:25:33,254
Can I put my arms down?

1613
01:25:33,422 --> 01:25:35,723
- Oh, yes, just keep them down.
- Okay.

1614
01:25:35,891 --> 01:25:38,292
As long as they're -
Sorry, I'm getting tense.

1615
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:39,860
Just relax.

1616
01:25:40,028 --> 01:25:41,328
As Norm releases the bees,

1617
01:25:41,496 --> 01:25:43,898
they come flying onto me at great speed.

1618
01:25:44,066 --> 01:25:47,368
It's like riding a motorbike
through a swarm.

1619
01:25:48,336 --> 01:25:50,604
I'm getting really tired.

1620
01:25:50,772 --> 01:25:53,207
At this point, you should
start feeling a lot of weight.

1621
01:25:53,375 --> 01:25:54,608
Yes, I can feel weight.

1622
01:25:54,776 --> 01:25:59,513
The bees are heavy. About
3,000, 4,000 bees per pound.

1623
01:25:59,681 --> 01:26:02,183
And you have at least
a half pound on your hat alone.

1624
01:26:02,350 --> 01:26:03,384
Yeah.

1625
01:26:03,552 --> 01:26:05,786
I can hear them so close-up...

1626
01:26:05,954 --> 01:26:10,257
that they feel as if
they're living in my ears,

1627
01:26:10,425 --> 01:26:12,493
and it's, like, deafening.

1628
01:26:12,661 --> 01:26:15,463
I can - Honestly, I cannot
hear anything that you're saying.

1629
01:26:15,630 --> 01:26:16,731
You have to shout.

1630
01:26:16,898 --> 01:26:21,102
I have to learn to relax
and look up straight.

1631
01:26:21,269 --> 01:26:22,970
I can't see a thing.

1632
01:26:23,138 --> 01:26:25,940
The bees are shading my eyes.

1633
01:26:26,108 --> 01:26:29,310
Can you see that?
I can hardly see a thing now.

1634
01:26:29,478 --> 01:26:31,445
It's awful.

1635
01:26:31,613 --> 01:26:37,017
Under the weight of 50,000 bees,
I'm feeling totally isolated.

1636
01:26:37,185 --> 01:26:39,019
I'm starting to panic again.

1637
01:26:39,187 --> 01:26:41,756
I want this to end now.

1638
01:26:41,923 --> 01:26:42,790
Please.

1639
01:26:42,958 --> 01:26:44,625
Ruud, I thought you might like to see

1640
01:26:44,793 --> 01:26:46,660
how you appear in the mirror, so...

1641
01:26:46,828 --> 01:26:48,329
- Oh, no...
- Take a look.

1642
01:26:48,497 --> 01:26:49,964
Oh, you're joking.

1643
01:26:50,132 --> 01:26:51,799
Oh, no, look at this!

1644
01:26:51,967 --> 01:26:54,702
Ah, this is amazing.

1645
01:26:59,574 --> 01:27:01,509
Hmm.

1646
01:27:03,812 --> 01:27:08,282
This is what you call
ultimate trust in insects.

1647
01:27:08,450 --> 01:27:09,750
They're not out to kill us.

1648
01:27:09,918 --> 01:27:12,019
That's not what they're about.

1649
01:27:12,187 --> 01:27:14,522
They're about to defend their honey,

1650
01:27:14,689 --> 01:27:16,323
because we always steal it,

1651
01:27:16,491 --> 01:27:22,396
and I reckon this is the most
powerful way of finding that out.

1652
01:27:24,299 --> 01:27:27,001
Okay, Ruud, it's time to get these bees off.

1653
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:34,542
A little bit on your cheek here,
huh, to start with?

1654
01:27:34,709 --> 01:27:35,576
- Whoops.
- Ugh!

1655
01:27:35,744 --> 01:27:36,777
I'm sorry. My fault.

1656
01:27:36,945 --> 01:27:38,946
I'm stung! I'm stung!

1657
01:27:39,114 --> 01:27:40,748
Will they attack?

1658
01:27:47,255 --> 01:27:49,423
Thank God, they stay calm.

1659
01:27:49,591 --> 01:27:51,125
I can't believe it.

1660
01:27:51,293 --> 01:27:52,927
I've done it.

1661
01:27:53,094 --> 01:27:55,029
But don't you do any of the things

1662
01:27:55,197 --> 01:27:56,831
you've seen me do on this show.

1663
01:27:56,998 --> 01:28:00,868
You have to be an expert
to face up to the world's baddest bugs

1664
01:28:01,036 --> 01:28:04,338
an expert and a little bit crazy.

1665
01:28:04,506 --> 01:28:06,707
Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow,
ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

1666
01:28:08,243 --> 01:28:10,411
You are essentially
free of bees, my good man.

1667
01:28:10,579 --> 01:28:11,579
Wow.

1668
01:28:11,746 --> 01:28:13,214
And you got two stings. Yeah.

1669
01:28:13,381 --> 01:28:14,882
Well, I'm sorry about that, but you know

1670
01:28:15,050 --> 01:28:16,684
it could have been 50,000...

1671
01:28:16,852 --> 01:28:19,486
- Yeah, I know...
- Under other circumstances.

1672
01:28:19,654 --> 01:28:21,288
I've never done anything
like this in my life,

1673
01:28:21,456 --> 01:28:26,126
and, um, I feel that
I put my trust in the bees

1674
01:28:26,294 --> 01:28:29,763
and what I know about them
and entered their world.

1675
01:28:29,931 --> 01:28:32,132
And I'll tell you
what you are constantly aware,

1676
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:37,037
if you make one such thing
as a wrong move, you're history.

1677
01:28:37,205 --> 01:28:40,307
Oops. That's it. You got to play their game.

1678
01:28:41,409 --> 01:28:44,011
What a stunt to finish on.

1679
01:28:44,179 --> 01:28:46,247
But we've done it. Yeah, we've done it!

1680
01:28:48,917 --> 01:28:50,150
Whoo-hoo!

1681
01:28:54,089 --> 01:28:55,789
Does it taste bad?

1682
01:28:55,957 --> 01:28:59,260
Hoo!

1683
01:29:03,198 --> 01:29:04,565
Ah, you did it!

1684
01:29:04,733 --> 01:29:05,799
Aye!

1685
01:29:05,967 --> 01:29:07,134
I call.

1686
01:29:07,302 --> 01:29:08,469
That's right, I did.

1687
01:29:08,637 --> 01:29:09,703
Whoa! Okay.

1688
01:29:09,871 --> 01:29:11,205
I'd like another one.

1689
01:29:11,373 --> 01:29:13,340
Ah! Ah, ah.

1690
01:29:15,277 --> 01:29:16,410
Yeah-ha!

1691
01:29:16,578 --> 01:29:18,178
Yeah!

1692
01:29:19,305 --> 01:29:25,636
