2
00:00:36,973 --> 00:00:38,452
- Ready Virge?
- Anytime.

3
00:00:39,053 --> 00:00:40,964
Turn him out!

4
00:00:42,413 --> 00:00:47,885
He's yours, Bo. Get him.
Get on him! Get on him, Bo!

5
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:49,452
Turn him over!

6
00:00:50,573 --> 00:00:53,212
Get him over. Get him over.

7
00:00:56,453 --> 00:00:59,684
- What's my time?
- Five-eight.

8
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:04,643
I'll win every prize they've got
down at that rodeo!

9
00:02:10,773 --> 00:02:12,331
Bo...

10
00:02:12,573 --> 00:02:17,203
...when you was 5, I throwed you
on a horse, and you was riding.

11
00:02:17,453 --> 00:02:19,887
- Remember?
- Yeah.

12
00:02:20,133 --> 00:02:25,082
When you was 8, I throwed you
in the creek, and you was swimming.

13
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:29,451
- Ain't that right?
- Sure, Virge. Splash!

14
00:02:31,093 --> 00:02:35,769
You're 21 years old, and we're
on our way to a big city: Phoenix.

15
00:02:36,013 --> 00:02:39,483
- It's time you met up with a gal.
- A gal?

16
00:02:39,733 --> 00:02:45,410
Nothing to be scared of. Women
and swimming is pretty much the same.

17
00:02:45,653 --> 00:02:49,248
You got good reflexes.
You'll make out just fine.

18
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:56,928
- Win some prize money.
- Take it easy!

19
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:12,412
- Two for Phoenix.
- We're going down for the rodeo.

20
00:03:12,613 --> 00:03:15,923
I'm gonna win me
about every prize they got.

21
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:21,366
That's nice. Sit down someplace.
You got a long ride ahead of you.

22
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:28,008
Bo, the lady's hat!

23
00:03:28,253 --> 00:03:31,802
- Oh, sorry, ma'am.
- Look where you're going.

24
00:03:32,053 --> 00:03:36,205
He ain't used to traveling.
It's his first time off the ranch.

25
00:03:36,453 --> 00:03:41,049
Virge, that's a lie, and you know it!
I've been all the way to Helena.

26
00:03:41,293 --> 00:03:44,968
That was when he was 12,
to have his tonsils out.

27
00:03:45,173 --> 00:03:48,563
- That still counts!
- Give me that.

28
00:03:54,013 --> 00:03:59,690
If you will marry me, me, me
If you will marry me

29
00:04:00,453 --> 00:04:05,243
I'll give to you a petticoat red
All stitched around with golden thread

30
00:04:05,493 --> 00:04:07,324
Virge?

31
00:04:08,813 --> 00:04:13,568
I've been thinking, you know,
about what you said.

32
00:04:14,173 --> 00:04:15,572
What was that?

33
00:04:15,813 --> 00:04:19,567
You know, about me finding a gal.

34
00:04:20,173 --> 00:04:23,404
Oh. What about it?

35
00:04:23,653 --> 00:04:27,646
I don't know anything
about gals, Virge.

36
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,451
Nothing at all.

37
00:04:29,693 --> 00:04:34,050
That's what I mean.
It's about time you learned.

38
00:04:34,293 --> 00:04:37,365
Ain't nothing to be scared of, Bo.

39
00:04:37,613 --> 00:04:41,367
You liked swimming
when you got used to it.

40
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:45,169
Besides, I know
the idea crossed your mind.

41
00:04:45,413 --> 00:04:49,565
I seen you looking at them pictures
in Orville's magazine.

42
00:04:51,053 --> 00:04:57,003
I'll give to you a feathery bed
With downy pillows for your head

43
00:04:57,253 --> 00:05:01,883
Maybe I glanced at them pictures
a couple of times.

44
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:07,412
But if I do find me a gal,
it won't be one from those magazines.

45
00:05:07,613 --> 00:05:09,968
I already decided.

46
00:05:10,933 --> 00:05:15,085
I'm gonna get me a angel.

47
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:18,370
- A angel?
- That's right.

48
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:23,565
I wouldn't set my sights too high
if I were you, Bo.

49
00:05:24,573 --> 00:05:28,646
You just pick out
some plain-looking little gal...

50
00:05:28,893 --> 00:05:32,932
...with a cooperating nature
and a good personality.

51
00:05:33,173 --> 00:05:35,892
I mean, we gotta be realistic.

52
00:05:36,133 --> 00:05:40,923
What's some angel gonna
want with a cowhand like you?

53
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:43,124
What's that got to do with it?

54
00:05:43,373 --> 00:05:47,810
That steer didn't wanna get throwed.
Well, I throwed him.

55
00:05:48,053 --> 00:05:50,328
Breaking in a wild horse...

56
00:05:50,573 --> 00:05:53,724
...you don't let what he wants
stop you:

57
00:05:53,973 --> 00:05:56,487
What makes you think
a gal's different?

58
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:59,327
This trip will be mighty educational.

59
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:04,246
Kiss me quick and go my honey
Kiss me quick and go

60
00:06:04,453 --> 00:06:10,453
Listen, virge, I'm gonna find me
an angel, a real hootenanny of an angel.

61
00:06:11,213 --> 00:06:12,931
She gives me any trouble...

62
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:17,729
...she'll find herself with her wings
pinned right to the ground!

63
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:34,605
- Morning, ma'am!
- What are you doing?

64
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,731
Pushups, to get the kinks
out of my bones.

65
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:39,969
Get up off that floor.

66
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:43,364
Thirty. Did 30 sit-ups too.

67
00:06:43,613 --> 00:06:47,606
Stop bothering folks.
Woke up everybody on the bus.

68
00:06:47,853 --> 00:06:50,845
It's morning. It's time to get up.

69
00:06:51,093 --> 00:06:55,928
That's the trouble with you city folk.
Lay in bed all day long.

70
00:06:56,173 --> 00:07:00,564
Then you get soft.
When do we stop for breakfast?

71
00:07:00,813 --> 00:07:03,964
Look, there's a place. You passed it!

72
00:07:04,213 --> 00:07:10,213
This is a public vehicle. Stops where
it's scheduled to stop, no place else.

73
00:07:10,813 --> 00:07:14,965
Meanwhile, what's a passenger to do?
Starve to death?

74
00:07:15,213 --> 00:07:18,285
Poor old lady's stomach is rumbling.

75
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:21,093
Bo! You're in civilization.

76
00:07:22,013 --> 00:07:24,766
Forgive him, ma'am.
He didn't hear a thing.

77
00:07:25,013 --> 00:07:27,402
Our next stop is Grace's Diner...

78
00:07:27,653 --> 00:07:32,408
...couple of miles up the road.
That's where we stop. Grace's!

79
00:07:45,693 --> 00:07:47,968
Can we get some breakfast here?

80
00:07:53,293 --> 00:07:57,206
- Hello, Grace.
- Look what the cat dragged in.

81
00:07:57,453 --> 00:07:59,728
- Elma, you the passenger?
- Right.

82
00:07:59,973 --> 00:08:03,204
- She's going for the concert.
- And to see my sister.

83
00:08:04,573 --> 00:08:05,562
Service!

84
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:09,932
- Your passengers are hungry.
- I'll go and wait on them.

85
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:15,082
Some crazy cowboys.
That young one is a real troublemaker.

86
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:19,565
His friend ain't so bad.
He just sits playing guitar.

87
00:08:19,853 --> 00:08:23,323
Little music's nice
when you're driving along.

88
00:08:23,573 --> 00:08:25,962
I'm very fond of music myself.

89
00:08:26,213 --> 00:08:28,602
Are you, Grace? I didn't know that.

90
00:08:28,853 --> 00:08:33,244
Yeah, I'm a very musical person.

91
00:08:34,293 --> 00:08:37,171
Come on in.
I'll fix you something to eat.

92
00:08:49,413 --> 00:08:50,766
Ma'am!

93
00:08:52,253 --> 00:08:53,971
Ma'am...

94
00:08:56,733 --> 00:08:58,644
Give me three hamburgers.

95
00:08:58,893 --> 00:09:02,249
- Three? How do you want them?
- Raw.

96
00:09:02,493 --> 00:09:05,405
- Honest?
- That's the only way to eat them.

97
00:09:05,653 --> 00:09:09,692
With a hunk of onion and
some pickle, and a piece of pie.

98
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:13,767
And a quart of milk.
He's still a growing boy.

99
00:09:14,573 --> 00:09:15,608
All right.

100
00:09:15,853 --> 00:09:20,131
Pie and coffee. I'm growing too,
but in a different way.

101
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:22,689
Gotta watch my figure.

102
00:09:25,813 --> 00:09:30,489
Real nice place you got here.
Much as I've seen of it.

103
00:09:30,733 --> 00:09:32,963
What does that mean?

104
00:09:33,213 --> 00:09:37,365
I bet that apartment you got
upstairs is real nice too.

105
00:09:37,613 --> 00:09:41,572
I'd love to see it sometime.
Have you got it fixed up?

106
00:09:48,253 --> 00:09:49,572
Don't pour it!

107
00:10:10,613 --> 00:10:13,571
Let's get going.
We'll never make Phoenix...

108
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,088
...sitting in this miserable restaurant!

109
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:20,167
- Hey, you!
- All aboard, folks.

110
00:10:21,093 --> 00:10:26,008
Wait! I happen to be the owner
of this miserable restaurant.

111
00:10:26,253 --> 00:10:30,485
Don't pay him no mind, ma'am.
It's just his way of talking.

112
00:10:30,733 --> 00:10:34,043
- I don't care for it.
- I don't blame you a bit.

113
00:10:34,293 --> 00:10:35,282
Virge!

114
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:39,003
This place is nice and clean
and well-run.

115
00:10:39,253 --> 00:10:42,211
You couldn't ask
for a prettier owner.

116
00:10:42,453 --> 00:10:43,772
Wait a minute.

117
00:10:44,013 --> 00:10:47,972
I mean it, and I wanna apologize
for this barbarian.

118
00:10:48,653 --> 00:10:52,089
- What you doing?
- Something I seen in a movie.

119
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:56,804
- It don't offend you, I trust.
- No, just caught me up short.

120
00:10:57,053 --> 00:11:01,365
Hand kissing! That ain't my idea
on how to get a gal.

121
00:11:01,573 --> 00:11:02,562
We know that.

122
00:11:02,813 --> 00:11:04,929
- Bye, Grace.
- So long, honey.

123
00:11:05,173 --> 00:11:09,132
- You the guitar player?
- That's right, ma'am.

124
00:11:09,373 --> 00:11:11,933
I'm real fond of music myself.

125
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:15,882
All aboard. Grace, see you
in a couple of days.

126
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:19,728
So long, Carl.
Good luck in the rodeo, cowboy.

127
00:11:19,973 --> 00:11:22,282
- Thanks, ma'am.
- Come back real soon.

128
00:11:24,693 --> 00:11:27,161
- So long, Carl.
- So long, Grace.

129
00:11:27,413 --> 00:11:29,768
Come back soon, hear?

130
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:58,443
Talk about angels! How about her?

131
00:12:00,493 --> 00:12:04,771
Well, she may be a angel, Virge.

132
00:12:06,373 --> 00:12:10,161
- She ain't my angel.
- How can you tell?

133
00:12:11,573 --> 00:12:12,972
I'll know.

134
00:12:14,453 --> 00:12:18,810
When I see my angel,
I'll know right off the bat.

135
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:23,447
Fasten your seat belts.
Take off your coats.

136
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:27,364
We'll be landing in Phoenix
in an hour.

137
00:12:32,093 --> 00:12:36,245
I'm sorry to leave you folks,
but this is where we get off.

138
00:12:41,453 --> 00:12:43,921
"Welcome, cowboys.

139
00:12:44,173 --> 00:12:46,562
The town is yours".

140
00:12:47,773 --> 00:12:49,729
That's us, virge! That's us!

141
00:12:49,973 --> 00:12:53,443
So long. Don't let him
take any wooden nickels.

142
00:12:53,653 --> 00:12:57,168
I'll drive you back,
if you're still in one piece.

143
00:12:57,413 --> 00:13:00,291
Don't you worry about us.
We'll be all right.

144
00:13:00,533 --> 00:13:03,206
You just drive your bus.
Let's register.

145
00:13:03,453 --> 00:13:06,570
- Is that our hotel?
- Bo!

146
00:13:09,493 --> 00:13:11,961
Bo, wait till the corner!

147
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:17,972
Remember, they go when it's green,
they stop when it's red.

148
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:24,488
Never seen so many gals.
There must be a hundred head of them!

149
00:13:27,733 --> 00:13:29,166
Bo!

150
00:13:31,493 --> 00:13:33,723
Wait till it turns green.

151
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:38,121
Kiss me quick and go my honey
Kiss me quick and go

152
00:13:38,293 --> 00:13:39,726
To cheat surprise and...

153
00:13:39,933 --> 00:13:44,211
vlRGE: You're gonna wash yourself
away! What are you doing?

154
00:13:44,453 --> 00:13:49,368
Ain't got this at home.
Shower and bath at the same time.

155
00:13:49,613 --> 00:13:54,767
Bo, you have a terrible habit
of overdoing everything. Come on!

156
00:14:18,613 --> 00:14:22,162
If you're gonna dawdle,
I'm gonna step across the street.

157
00:14:22,413 --> 00:14:24,768
That Blue Dragon seems interesting.

158
00:14:25,013 --> 00:14:28,767
You go ahead. I'll be there
in a couple of minutes.

159
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:33,369
Wait outside!

160
00:14:33,613 --> 00:14:37,242
Why aren't you outside
where you belong?

161
00:14:37,493 --> 00:14:42,647
I've had enough of you, you
ignorant hillbilly. Get to work!

162
00:14:52,053 --> 00:14:54,487
Better change into your costume.

163
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:12,970
- He called me an ignorant hillbilly!
- Ain't you?

164
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:16,285
Not ignorant,
but you do come from the Ozarks.

165
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:19,570
I ain't sung hillbilly since I was...

166
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:22,765
Well, not since I turned chanteuse.

167
00:15:25,213 --> 00:15:28,171
I've been trying to be somebody.

168
00:15:31,573 --> 00:15:35,566
Can you imagine Hildegarde
doing her number...

169
00:15:35,813 --> 00:15:38,407
...sitting in some truck driver's lap?

170
00:15:38,653 --> 00:15:42,965
- I don't know why you just don't quit.
- I can't.

171
00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:48,888
Look! I don't get paid
till Wednesday.

172
00:15:50,493 --> 00:15:52,927
I owe for my room and everything.

173
00:15:53,173 --> 00:15:57,564
Besides that, it took me too long
to get this far.

174
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:04,169
- What's that line for?
- That line?

175
00:16:04,413 --> 00:16:10,124
You might say that this line here
is a history of my life up till now.

176
00:16:10,733 --> 00:16:13,327
- See right there where it starts?
- Yeah.

177
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:18,693
That's River Gulch,
the little old town where I was born.

178
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:23,768
- I never even heard of it.
- Well, it ain't there anymore.

179
00:16:24,013 --> 00:16:28,564
Floods washed us all away,
all except me and my sister, Nan.

180
00:16:28,813 --> 00:16:32,886
I just picked her up
and took her along this line...

181
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:37,285
...till we got to Lubbock, Texas.

182
00:16:37,533 --> 00:16:39,808
You know what happened there?

183
00:16:40,053 --> 00:16:45,366
Nan got this job as a waitress,
and I worked in Liggett's Drugstore.

184
00:16:45,613 --> 00:16:48,810
And this amateur contest opened...

185
00:16:49,053 --> 00:16:53,410
...and Nan said to me,
"Why don't you enter that contest?

186
00:16:53,653 --> 00:16:57,532
You've been watching people in movies".
We used to live in the movies.

187
00:16:57,773 --> 00:17:01,925
"You've watched people
put over their gestures".

188
00:17:02,173 --> 00:17:05,609
And so I did it, and I won it.

189
00:17:05,853 --> 00:17:08,526
- First prize?
- No, second prize.

190
00:17:08,773 --> 00:17:12,766
Two boys juggling milk bottles
won first prize.

191
00:17:13,293 --> 00:17:17,286
Anyway, that's how
I got my direction and all.

192
00:17:17,533 --> 00:17:21,082
- Direction?
- Lf you don't have a direction...

193
00:17:21,293 --> 00:17:23,887
...you keep going round in circles.

194
00:17:24,133 --> 00:17:29,287
Look, you can see by this
just how straight my direction is.

195
00:17:29,653 --> 00:17:34,363
River Gulch. This is where I am now.
And look where I'm going.

196
00:17:34,613 --> 00:17:38,367
- Where?
- Hollywood and Vine!

197
00:17:38,813 --> 00:17:42,567
Look, straight as an arrow!
River Gulch...

198
00:17:42,933 --> 00:17:44,651
...Hollywood and Vine!

199
00:17:44,893 --> 00:17:47,612
What happens when you get there?

200
00:17:47,853 --> 00:17:52,483
You get discovered. You get tested,
with options and everything.

201
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:55,611
And you get treated with respect too.

202
00:17:59,133 --> 00:18:01,169
What's going on in here?

203
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:05,725
She's changing into her costume.
You want her out there naked?

204
00:18:05,973 --> 00:18:08,567
Take care of them tables.

205
00:18:09,253 --> 00:18:14,452
Come on, Dinah Shore. Them cowboys
is getting real lonesome.

206
00:18:15,373 --> 00:18:16,772
Zip her up.

207
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:20,728
Go zip yourself up.

208
00:18:33,253 --> 00:18:35,369
He looks like the safest.

209
00:18:38,133 --> 00:18:39,725
I never know what to say.

210
00:18:39,973 --> 00:18:43,329
It's easy.
Just say some cute little joke.

211
00:18:43,573 --> 00:18:47,964
Like, "Hello, buy me a drink?
I'm so dry, I'm spitting cotton".

212
00:18:48,213 --> 00:18:50,966
That's a real cute one. Go on.

213
00:19:04,933 --> 00:19:06,571
Hello, mister.

214
00:19:08,453 --> 00:19:12,082
- Howdy.
- I wonder if you'd buy me a drink.

215
00:19:13,173 --> 00:19:16,210
I'm so dry, I'm spitting cotton.

216
00:19:20,933 --> 00:19:25,723
That's a good one, it is.
Whiskey for the lady, beer for me.

217
00:19:26,453 --> 00:19:29,889
I'll give to you a paper of pins

218
00:19:30,093 --> 00:19:33,563
And that's the way our love begins

219
00:19:33,733 --> 00:19:39,733
If you will marry me, me, me
If you will marry me

220
00:19:43,133 --> 00:19:46,250
You sure have a good head for whiskey.

221
00:19:46,493 --> 00:19:49,849
I'm not keeping track,
but that's four in a row.

222
00:19:50,093 --> 00:19:54,928
Oh, that's the way I am.
Sometimes I drink all night long.

223
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:58,722
Happy days.
What you doing? Let go of me.

224
00:19:58,973 --> 00:20:01,248
- That ain't whiskey.
- Let go!

225
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:06,044
- That's tea.
- That's all they let us drink here.

226
00:20:06,293 --> 00:20:09,126
Last night I had to drink
15 tea and sodas.

227
00:20:09,373 --> 00:20:12,012
You've been hustling me for drinks!

228
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:16,007
I can't stand a woman
making a sucker out of me!

229
00:20:20,293 --> 00:20:23,763
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen!

230
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:29,570
I know you ain't paying attention,
you're too busy enjoying yourselves.

231
00:20:30,253 --> 00:20:34,041
But we got this little floorshow
and we have to do it.

232
00:20:34,853 --> 00:20:37,765
Hope it don't disturb you none.

233
00:20:38,493 --> 00:20:40,563
Okay, baby, take it away.

234
00:20:52,773 --> 00:20:58,609
That old black magic has me

235
00:20:58,853 --> 00:21:02,926
In its spell

236
00:21:03,093 --> 00:21:08,326
That old black magic that you

237
00:21:08,853 --> 00:21:12,129
Weave so well

238
00:21:12,293 --> 00:21:16,764
Those icy fingers up

239
00:21:18,253 --> 00:21:22,007
And down my spine

240
00:21:22,173 --> 00:21:25,848
The same old witchcraft

241
00:21:26,253 --> 00:21:31,281
When your eyes meet mine

242
00:21:31,453 --> 00:21:35,332
The same old tingle...

243
00:21:36,933 --> 00:21:39,163
- Bo.
- That's her, virge.

244
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,652
That's my angel.

245
00:21:41,893 --> 00:21:44,885
Angel? She's just a gal
works in a saloon.

246
00:21:45,133 --> 00:21:47,693
Look at her gleaming there...

247
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:50,572
...so pale and white.

248
00:21:50,813 --> 00:21:54,567
And down and down...

249
00:21:56,693 --> 00:21:58,763
Shh! Quiet!

250
00:22:00,373 --> 00:22:01,567
Quiet! Shh!

251
00:22:02,853 --> 00:22:05,367
Keep quiet over there!

252
00:22:17,773 --> 00:22:19,525
Bo, Bo...

253
00:22:21,213 --> 00:22:22,805
That's better!

254
00:22:23,053 --> 00:22:26,409
Now keep it quiet!
The lady's trying to sing!

255
00:22:26,653 --> 00:22:30,965
- Sit down, cowboy.
- That goes for you too, mister.

256
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:34,242
Quiet!

257
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:47,123
Okay, miss, you can go on
with your song now.

258
00:22:53,133 --> 00:22:56,330
- Where were we, Henry?
- "I should stay away".

259
00:23:00,853 --> 00:23:04,482
I should stay away

260
00:23:04,653 --> 00:23:09,647
But what can I do?

261
00:23:09,813 --> 00:23:11,849
I hear your name

262
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,369
And I'm...

263
00:23:14,973 --> 00:23:17,692
...aflame

264
00:23:18,893 --> 00:23:21,691
Aflame with such

265
00:23:21,973 --> 00:23:24,851
A burning desire

266
00:23:25,533 --> 00:23:30,163
That only your kiss, kiss

267
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:36,090
Kiss can put out the fire

268
00:23:36,893 --> 00:23:41,489
For you're the lover I have waited for

269
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:46,283
The mate that fate had me created for

270
00:23:46,933 --> 00:23:52,933
And every time
Your lips meet mine

271
00:23:55,413 --> 00:24:00,567
Darling, down and down I go

272
00:24:00,733 --> 00:24:05,011
Round and round I go

273
00:24:05,293 --> 00:24:10,242
In a spin, loving the spin

274
00:24:10,493 --> 00:24:13,769
I'm in under that

275
00:24:14,013 --> 00:24:19,690
Old black magic called love
Love

276
00:24:19,933 --> 00:24:23,972
Love, love, love

277
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:39,366
What's wrong? The lady's finished.
You can start your yammering again.

278
00:24:43,573 --> 00:24:46,371
Go ahead, start yammering!

279
00:24:56,813 --> 00:25:01,887
My name's Beauregard Decker.
I'm 21, and I own a ranch in Montana.

280
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:04,601
I got a herd of cattle and horses...

281
00:25:04,853 --> 00:25:08,163
...and the finest sheep,
hogs and chickens.

282
00:25:08,413 --> 00:25:09,926
I come to the rodeo...

283
00:25:10,173 --> 00:25:14,485
...with the idea of finding a angel.
And you're it.

284
00:25:14,733 --> 00:25:17,088
I don't have time to sweet-talk...

285
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:20,962
...so I'd be obliged to you
if you'd step outside with me.

286
00:25:21,213 --> 00:25:23,169
What'd you say?

287
00:25:26,053 --> 00:25:28,203
My name is Beauregard Decker.

288
00:25:28,453 --> 00:25:33,573
I'm 21 years old, and I own my
own ranch in Timber Hill, Montana...

289
00:25:33,813 --> 00:25:36,486
- I heard all that.
- Let's get out of here.

290
00:25:36,693 --> 00:25:42,450
No, uh... I'm mighty grateful to you
for what you did...

291
00:25:42,693 --> 00:25:47,562
...but we're not allowed
to go out with the customers.

292
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:51,166
But you can buy me a drink
if you want to.

293
00:25:51,413 --> 00:25:55,088
- I'm so dry, I'm spitting cotton.
- I don't use it.

294
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:59,121
I ain't got time.
I wanna be in bed by 10:00.

295
00:25:59,573 --> 00:26:03,452
I'm in the rodeo tomorrow,
so I need my sleep.

296
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:06,606
- Will you come on?
- We're not supposed...

297
00:26:06,853 --> 00:26:08,411
- Bo.
- Hold my hat.

298
00:26:08,653 --> 00:26:11,565
- Where you going?
- Splash!

299
00:26:18,653 --> 00:26:23,249
- You're sure a good singer.
- I'm a chanteuse.

300
00:26:25,053 --> 00:26:27,613
That's why I call myself "Cherie".

301
00:26:27,853 --> 00:26:30,526
That's my name, Cherie.

302
00:26:31,373 --> 00:26:35,366
- That's all the name you've got?
- That's all you need.

303
00:26:35,613 --> 00:26:39,492
Like Hildegarde.
She's a chanteuse too.

304
00:26:40,493 --> 00:26:41,972
Cherry.

305
00:26:42,413 --> 00:26:44,165
Cherie!

306
00:26:44,773 --> 00:26:48,322
It's French. It means "dear one".

307
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:51,963
Beauregard is kind of French.
It means something too.

308
00:26:52,573 --> 00:26:56,566
- What's it mean?
- I ain't gonna tell. You'd laugh.

309
00:26:56,813 --> 00:26:59,327
- No, I wouldn't.
- Yes, you would.

310
00:26:59,573 --> 00:27:01,768
Honest, I wouldn't.

311
00:27:02,653 --> 00:27:03,768
Well...

312
00:27:05,053 --> 00:27:08,568
...it means "good-looking".

313
00:27:08,813 --> 00:27:13,170
I never told that to a single person.
My ma was French.

314
00:27:15,253 --> 00:27:19,883
That's a real pretty name.
Beauregard.

315
00:27:21,133 --> 00:27:25,570
You are too. Real beauregard.

316
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:34,366
Everybody just calls me Bo.

317
00:27:38,853 --> 00:27:41,765
- Cherry.
- Cherie.

318
00:27:43,053 --> 00:27:46,170
It was nice how you made
everybody shut up.

319
00:27:46,413 --> 00:27:48,768
Like you had respect for me.

320
00:27:50,013 --> 00:27:53,403
You made them have respect too.

321
00:27:54,253 --> 00:27:57,689
- I liked that.
- You did?

322
00:28:00,853 --> 00:28:03,162
- Yes.
- Did you like me too?

323
00:28:04,613 --> 00:28:08,606
At first, I thought you was
some kind of a hooligan...

324
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:12,402
...yelling and stomping like that.

325
00:28:14,573 --> 00:28:18,168
But when I realized
you was doing it for me...

326
00:28:18,413 --> 00:28:20,608
...I was attracted to you.

327
00:28:20,853 --> 00:28:22,366
Attracted?

328
00:28:25,053 --> 00:28:27,283
- You was?
- I still am.

329
00:28:27,533 --> 00:28:32,163
You still are? Really attracted?

330
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:34,732
Uh-huh.

331
00:28:35,093 --> 00:28:39,166
- It's only a physical attraction.
- Physical?

332
00:28:40,533 --> 00:28:44,811
I mean, you're so big
and strong and...

333
00:28:45,053 --> 00:28:48,045
...well, so darn healthy looking.

334
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,853
Guess I am in pretty good shape.

335
00:28:51,053 --> 00:28:54,762
You gotta be to compete
in all five events...

336
00:28:59,373 --> 00:29:01,364
Cherry.

337
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:04,205
Beauregard.

338
00:29:11,293 --> 00:29:16,083
Sir, have you seen Cherie?
The gal you were sitting with.

339
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:18,801
She went off with another customer.

340
00:29:19,053 --> 00:29:21,362
I was worried.
It's time for the second show.

341
00:29:25,133 --> 00:29:29,923
I want you to be the first to know.
After all, it was your idea.

342
00:29:30,173 --> 00:29:34,086
- What was?
- I've found me that gal like you said.

343
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:37,166
Cherry and me, we're engaged.

344
00:29:38,493 --> 00:29:41,690
- We're what?
- Engaged.

345
00:29:41,933 --> 00:29:46,723
Virge, I want you to meet Cherry.
Cherry, this is Virge.

346
00:29:46,973 --> 00:29:48,645
He'll be living with us.

347
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:53,085
- We already met.
- Someone's got the wrong idea here.

348
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:57,611
- What do you mean, Cherry?
- I told you my name is Cherie.

349
00:29:57,853 --> 00:30:02,483
I can't say it fancy like that.
What's the matter with Cherry?

350
00:30:02,733 --> 00:30:04,564
Well, it ain't dignified.

351
00:30:04,853 --> 00:30:05,808
Bo...

352
00:30:05,973 --> 00:30:11,127
The rodeo starts tomorrow afternoon.
We'll get married out there!

353
00:30:11,373 --> 00:30:15,969
- Married? Out where?
- At the rodeo.

354
00:30:16,213 --> 00:30:20,252
Tomorrow, after the finals,
we'll all catch the bus back.

355
00:30:20,733 --> 00:30:23,167
You don't know nothing about this gal.

356
00:30:23,533 --> 00:30:27,048
I know she's my angel,
that's good enough for me.

357
00:30:27,293 --> 00:30:32,447
Your angel was hustling me for drinks.
Sixty cents a shot.

358
00:30:32,693 --> 00:30:36,083
And it wasn't whiskey
she was drinking, it was tea.

359
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:40,770
Of course it was, Virge!
Angels don't touch no liquor!

360
00:30:41,013 --> 00:30:44,210
I gotta kiss you again!
I just can't help myself.

361
00:30:45,813 --> 00:30:48,452
Cut it out! Everybody's looking.

362
00:30:48,693 --> 00:30:53,164
Let them. Ain't no crime when
we're getting married tomorrow.

363
00:30:54,013 --> 00:30:57,926
We'll be very happy together,
till death do us part.

364
00:30:58,733 --> 00:31:03,090
I better get to bed.
Virge, come on, let's get going.

365
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:07,246
We'll make the rest
of the plans in the morning.

366
00:31:07,573 --> 00:31:09,211
For a wedding present...

367
00:31:09,453 --> 00:31:13,128
...I'll get you a deep-freeze
or an electric washer...

368
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:16,251
...or any other major appliance
you want:

369
00:31:16,413 --> 00:31:17,607
Good night, darling.

370
00:31:19,933 --> 00:31:21,446
You're on again.

371
00:31:21,933 --> 00:31:24,447
What's the matter? What happened?

372
00:31:25,253 --> 00:31:28,802
You know something?
I'm not quite sure.

373
00:31:30,533 --> 00:31:33,445
This whole thing is probably my fault.

374
00:31:33,693 --> 00:31:37,766
I told you it was about time
you started learning about women.

375
00:31:38,013 --> 00:31:42,962
I ain't saying this gal you picked
ain't a good one to practice on.

376
00:31:43,213 --> 00:31:46,967
But a fella can't go marrying
the first gal he meets.

377
00:31:47,173 --> 00:31:50,882
- Why not?
- Better get your mind on that rodeo.

378
00:31:51,133 --> 00:31:54,284
Fellas at the ranch
got their money on you.

379
00:31:54,533 --> 00:31:57,286
She has no intention of marrying you.

380
00:31:58,533 --> 00:32:00,967
Yes, she has, Virge.

381
00:32:01,213 --> 00:32:05,172
She's got a physical attraction to me.
She said so herself.

382
00:32:08,933 --> 00:32:11,652
- Virge.
- Yeah, Bo?

383
00:32:13,053 --> 00:32:16,807
What's the difference
between a physical attraction...

384
00:32:17,053 --> 00:32:20,045
...and just a regular attraction?

385
00:32:20,293 --> 00:32:23,410
A gal can be attracted to a fella...

386
00:32:23,653 --> 00:32:26,326
...for lots of reasons.

387
00:32:26,573 --> 00:32:30,202
- His mind, for instance.
- His mind?

388
00:32:30,453 --> 00:32:35,163
Sure. Like if he's smart
or reads poetry...

389
00:32:35,413 --> 00:32:37,005
...or something.

390
00:32:37,253 --> 00:32:39,642
- No kidding?
- That's right.

391
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:43,642
I can read and write.

392
00:32:44,653 --> 00:32:49,773
I don't know no poetry, but I can
recite the Gettysburg Address.

393
00:32:50,013 --> 00:32:54,643
- Would that count?
- It might. I doubt it, but it might.

394
00:32:56,413 --> 00:32:59,405
That old black magic has me
In its spell, that old...

395
00:33:02,693 --> 00:33:06,402
I should stay away but what can I do
I hear your name

396
00:33:06,933 --> 00:33:08,685
Cherry!

397
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:11,003
- And I'm aflame
- Yes?

398
00:33:11,213 --> 00:33:14,523
- Morning, ma'am!
- Wait a minute.

399
00:33:16,921 --> 00:33:19,833
We're gonna be married.
I'm waking her up.

400
00:33:21,281 --> 00:33:24,876
Cherry, wake up. It's Beauregard!
Morning, Cherry!

401
00:33:25,121 --> 00:33:29,273
- Let's get a little air.
- Young man, I don't allow callers...

402
00:33:29,481 --> 00:33:33,235
Get out of bed.
The parade starts at 10:30.

403
00:33:33,481 --> 00:33:37,440
- I don't want any trouble.
- How do I know you're engaged?

404
00:33:37,681 --> 00:33:40,798
Cherry, wake up
and tell her you know me.

405
00:33:41,041 --> 00:33:42,713
What?

406
00:33:43,681 --> 00:33:47,560
- Oh, it's you!
- You see, she knows me.

407
00:33:47,801 --> 00:33:51,635
For the love...
I don't know what's going on...

408
00:33:51,881 --> 00:33:54,156
Come on. We gotta get going.

409
00:33:54,401 --> 00:33:57,393
We're getting married today.
We got lots to do.

410
00:33:57,641 --> 00:34:01,270
What's the idea,
busting in here like that?

411
00:34:01,521 --> 00:34:06,231
- What time is it?
- After 9:00. I've been up for hours.

412
00:34:06,481 --> 00:34:09,154
Nine! I didn't get to bed till 5!

413
00:34:09,401 --> 00:34:14,839
Five? No wonder you're so pale
and white.

414
00:34:15,601 --> 00:34:19,879
Cherry, know what that is out there?
That's the sun.

415
00:34:20,121 --> 00:34:22,681
Will you get out?
I'll call the police.

416
00:34:22,921 --> 00:34:24,912
You shouldn't stay up so late.

417
00:34:25,161 --> 00:34:30,440
When we get up to the ranch, we'll
hit the sack every night at 7:30.

418
00:34:30,681 --> 00:34:33,036
We better get something straight.

419
00:34:33,281 --> 00:34:36,512
I have no intention in the world
of marrying you.

420
00:34:36,761 --> 00:34:41,596
- So get it out of your head.
- We'll talk all that over on the way.

421
00:34:41,841 --> 00:34:43,911
You see, the problem is...

422
00:34:44,161 --> 00:34:48,359
...you just haven't had time yet
to get attracted to my mind.

423
00:34:48,601 --> 00:34:52,514
I know all about your mind
I ever wanna know.

424
00:34:52,761 --> 00:34:54,911
I know the Gettysburg Address.

425
00:34:55,161 --> 00:35:00,599
Busting in here like a wild Indian
of some kind.

426
00:35:00,841 --> 00:35:02,160
Cherry?

427
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:04,120
What?

428
00:35:05,601 --> 00:35:11,233
"Four score and seven years ago our
fathers brought forth a new nation...

429
00:35:11,481 --> 00:35:16,509
...dedicated to the proposition
that all men are created equal.

430
00:35:16,801 --> 00:35:19,031
Now we're engaged in a civil war...

431
00:35:19,281 --> 00:35:24,514
...to determine whether any nation
so conceived can long endure.

432
00:35:24,761 --> 00:35:28,879
- We are met on a battlefield... "
- I hate parades. I'm not going.

433
00:35:29,121 --> 00:35:32,670
"The world will not remember
what we say here...

434
00:35:32,921 --> 00:35:36,470
...but it'll never forget
what they did here.

435
00:35:36,721 --> 00:35:39,474
- It is for us to be...
- Let me sleep.

436
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:44,795
...so concentrated
and so dedicated... "

437
00:35:45,041 --> 00:35:48,238
Any further and
you'll miss the parade.

438
00:36:19,521 --> 00:36:23,912
Elliot, got anything?
Would you hold it please, miss?

439
00:36:24,161 --> 00:36:26,436
We're from LIFE.

440
00:36:27,401 --> 00:36:29,790
LIFE magazine?

441
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:35,520
That's right. "LIFE Goes to a Rodeo".
Or "rodeo" to you.

442
00:36:35,841 --> 00:36:40,551
They wanted me to ride in the
parade, but then I couldn't see it.

443
00:36:40,801 --> 00:36:41,995
Come on in here.

444
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:47,315
Excuse us. Come on, we're gonna
see us a parade real good.

445
00:36:48,321 --> 00:36:53,349
Can't we find a place to sit down?
You didn't let me get no sleep.

446
00:36:53,601 --> 00:36:58,391
Hop up on my shoulder. You can
rest and see good at the same time.

447
00:36:58,641 --> 00:37:02,475
- Bo, you put me down!
- This is a nice arrangement.

448
00:37:03,161 --> 00:37:07,313
Can you see everything?
- Too much.

449
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:11,389
Look! I'm glad I'm not in this
parade so I can see it.

450
00:37:11,641 --> 00:37:16,192
Here come Daniel Boone's men!
This is a hootenanny of a parade.

451
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:19,834
Look at them boys.
Ain't they talented?

452
00:37:20,081 --> 00:37:22,072
Ain't they resplendent?

453
00:37:22,321 --> 00:37:24,789
Look, there's cowgirls, and they got...

454
00:37:39,921 --> 00:37:41,240
Hi!

455
00:37:41,841 --> 00:37:45,072
Hi! Where is he?

456
00:37:51,081 --> 00:37:53,800
- You gonna marry him?
- No!

457
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:56,919
- Then you gonna go to the rodeo?
- No.

458
00:37:57,161 --> 00:38:00,631
- What you gonna do?
- Run away.

459
00:38:02,001 --> 00:38:05,914
What's going on up there?
Who you signaling at?

460
00:38:07,161 --> 00:38:10,153
Two. Vera is a friend of mine.

461
00:38:10,401 --> 00:38:15,111
She's gonna get two tickets
to the rodeo to watch you.

462
00:38:15,921 --> 00:38:18,833
Get two tickets for the rodeo.

463
00:38:19,921 --> 00:38:21,513
Two?

464
00:38:29,601 --> 00:38:32,240
Hey, there's old virge! Yahoo!

465
00:38:33,281 --> 00:38:36,717
- Stop it!
- Here we are, virge. We're watching.

466
00:38:36,961 --> 00:38:41,716
- You're doing just...
- Hello there. Stop it, Bo!

467
00:38:54,521 --> 00:38:57,752
Sorry, lady, you're over there
in the bleachers.

468
00:38:58,401 --> 00:39:02,713
Over there?
It's so much nicer here in the shade.

469
00:39:02,961 --> 00:39:04,474
That's right.

470
00:39:06,001 --> 00:39:07,719
Come on, honey.

471
00:39:18,961 --> 00:39:21,759
They got us over here
with the livestock.

472
00:39:22,001 --> 00:39:25,471
We go into our first
contest of the afternoon:

473
00:39:25,721 --> 00:39:27,712
Cowboy saddle bronc riding.

474
00:39:27,961 --> 00:39:32,477
The contestant is required
to ride 10 seconds.

475
00:39:40,361 --> 00:39:42,921
That was Duane Howard
from North Dakota.

476
00:39:43,161 --> 00:39:47,518
The next rider up
is Guy Weeks from Texas.

477
00:39:52,401 --> 00:39:56,952
There's Casey Tibbs, five-time
World Champion Rider...

478
00:39:57,201 --> 00:40:00,318
...twice All-Around Champion
Cowboy of the World.

479
00:40:08,401 --> 00:40:13,236
Watch our pickup man as he recovers
Casey Tibbs, South Dakota.

480
00:40:17,361 --> 00:40:21,513
- Cherie, wake up. It's him!
- Tell him to go away.

481
00:40:21,761 --> 00:40:24,673
It's him! He's gonna ride now.

482
00:40:27,001 --> 00:40:29,310
We're at the rodeo!

483
00:40:30,801 --> 00:40:34,111
- What's that green thing?
- That ain't green.

484
00:40:34,361 --> 00:40:36,033
Know what that is?

485
00:40:36,241 --> 00:40:40,359
That old black magic
That's gonna make me win

486
00:40:40,841 --> 00:40:45,995
What's that he's got around his
neck? Ain't that your scarf?

487
00:40:46,401 --> 00:40:49,632
So that's where it went!

488
00:40:49,881 --> 00:40:54,909
We have a newcomer from
Timber Hill, Montana: Bo Decker.

489
00:41:02,201 --> 00:41:05,113
- I can't look!
- You are stuck on him!

490
00:41:05,361 --> 00:41:09,513
Good work, Bo.
How about a hand? Bo Decker.

491
00:41:16,441 --> 00:41:22,311
Hey, Cherry! Yahoo! Yahoo!

492
00:41:26,201 --> 00:41:28,920
You know, I think he is crazy.

493
00:41:29,601 --> 00:41:34,311
Sure he is. Crazy as a bedbug.
I told you he was.

494
00:41:35,601 --> 00:41:39,719
He thinks we're getting married
this afternoon at the rodeo.

495
00:41:39,961 --> 00:41:42,395
What makes him think that?

496
00:41:42,641 --> 00:41:46,520
I don't know.
Sure weren't nothing I said.

497
00:41:48,001 --> 00:41:51,437
After the parade,
he dragged me to City Hall...

498
00:41:51,681 --> 00:41:53,876
...and bought a marriage license.

499
00:41:54,121 --> 00:41:56,316
You didn't sign nothing, did you?

500
00:41:56,561 --> 00:42:01,760
I had to. He was making such a fuss
in front of all those people.

501
00:42:01,961 --> 00:42:03,633
Honey...

502
00:42:03,881 --> 00:42:06,679
Here's a ride to watch.
The cowboy...

503
00:42:06,921 --> 00:42:10,914
...has drawn the toughest horse
in our contest.

504
00:42:11,881 --> 00:42:13,519
Don't fall off.

505
00:42:15,961 --> 00:42:17,713
He fell off.

506
00:42:18,841 --> 00:42:22,117
Is that a diamond?

507
00:42:22,361 --> 00:42:26,195
It ain't exactly a diamond...

508
00:42:26,441 --> 00:42:30,354
...but it ain't exactly
not a diamond, either.

509
00:42:31,001 --> 00:42:35,313
- He paid $43 for it.
- No kidding!

510
00:42:35,561 --> 00:42:37,233
Plus tax.

511
00:42:37,481 --> 00:42:40,439
He made me take it,
but it ain't on my finger.

512
00:42:40,681 --> 00:42:44,594
And neither is that
wedding ring he bought.

513
00:42:44,841 --> 00:42:47,071
Wedding ring?

514
00:42:47,321 --> 00:42:49,198
Oh, honey!

515
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:52,080
Calf roping is our next contest.

516
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:56,394
It's a race against time,
and every second counts.

517
00:43:01,681 --> 00:43:05,720
Notice the work of the horse,
keeping the rope tight.

518
00:43:07,801 --> 00:43:10,440
I'm gonna pretend that calf is Cherry.

519
00:43:10,681 --> 00:43:15,709
- I'm gonna get her and rope her.
- Don't let the calf get away.

520
00:43:17,801 --> 00:43:18,995
Get going, Cherry!

521
00:43:19,761 --> 00:43:23,197
Here's our newcomer again,
Bo Decker of Montana.

522
00:43:37,721 --> 00:43:40,793
Was that fast enough for you, Cherry?

523
00:43:42,481 --> 00:43:44,153
Who is she, Bo?

524
00:43:44,481 --> 00:43:45,914
Come on.

525
00:43:47,401 --> 00:43:51,519
Look! Photographers from LIFE.
They're heading this way.

526
00:43:51,761 --> 00:43:55,231
- LIFE magazine?
- They almost took my picture.

527
00:43:55,481 --> 00:43:58,120
Quick, my lipstick!

528
00:43:58,281 --> 00:44:03,401
Oh!
Would you please hand me my lipstick?

529
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:04,915
Smile!

530
00:44:06,281 --> 00:44:09,159
Basic. Thank you.

531
00:44:09,401 --> 00:44:11,756
I didn't have my lipstick on yet!

532
00:44:12,001 --> 00:44:16,916
The most dangerous event
is wild Brahma bull riding.

533
00:44:17,161 --> 00:44:20,597
There's an extra star.
We have Cousin Hugo...

534
00:44:20,841 --> 00:44:22,797
...our bullfighting chimpanzee.

535
00:44:23,041 --> 00:44:26,954
It's his job to ride on the dummy
and attract the bull.

536
00:44:40,201 --> 00:44:42,920
Cowboy clowns
also distract the bull...

537
00:44:43,161 --> 00:44:46,915
...when the cowboy gets bucked off.

538
00:45:02,201 --> 00:45:04,669
Don't break your neck.

539
00:45:04,921 --> 00:45:09,517
If I was to break my neck,
I couldn't get married.

540
00:45:09,761 --> 00:45:13,197
Him breaking his neck
is the only hope you've got.

541
00:45:13,441 --> 00:45:16,194
Here's our old friend Bo Decker.

542
00:45:16,441 --> 00:45:21,993
He still wears that green scarf.
Let's hope it brings him luck.

543
00:45:40,641 --> 00:45:42,757
Good ride, Bo.

544
00:45:43,921 --> 00:45:48,278
Cherry! Did you see me ride that bull?
Cherry!

545
00:45:49,961 --> 00:45:52,111
Stop it!

546
00:45:54,921 --> 00:45:58,675
- Cherry!
- He don't have no manners at all!

547
00:45:58,921 --> 00:46:01,116
No, but he's got something else.

548
00:46:01,361 --> 00:46:05,559
And he's gonna get some little gal,
you just watch.

549
00:46:05,761 --> 00:46:10,630
Well, it ain't gonna be me.
Besides, how can we get married?

550
00:46:10,881 --> 00:46:14,157
He ain't made no arrangements. Silly.

551
00:46:14,401 --> 00:46:17,154
Cherie, look.

552
00:46:17,401 --> 00:46:21,519
Ain't that a preacher?
Oh, my goodness!

553
00:46:25,001 --> 00:46:26,400
Excuse me, please.

554
00:46:26,601 --> 00:46:29,035
Where's the one getting married?

555
00:46:29,241 --> 00:46:31,835
- Getting married? Here?
- That's right.

556
00:46:32,081 --> 00:46:33,480
- Elliot!
- Boing!

557
00:46:35,361 --> 00:46:37,955
There she is. Cowboy's girl.

558
00:46:38,201 --> 00:46:42,717
Bo's also entered in our
bulldogging contest.

559
00:46:51,161 --> 00:46:52,560
How do I get out?

560
00:46:52,961 --> 00:46:57,477
The exit's over there. To get to it
you gotta go around...

561
00:46:57,721 --> 00:46:59,712
Hey, where are you going?

562
00:47:01,481 --> 00:47:04,279
Cherie! You gonna be
stomped to death!

563
00:47:04,561 --> 00:47:07,871
Cherry! What's going on here?

564
00:47:08,121 --> 00:47:10,760
- Wait! Where are you going?
- My shoe!

565
00:47:13,601 --> 00:47:17,913
Cherry, come back! Hey,
somebody hold this thing for me.

566
00:47:18,681 --> 00:47:23,232
She ain't here, and I don't know
when she's coming back.

567
00:47:23,481 --> 00:47:26,154
I don't believe you.
She's here someplace.

568
00:47:26,401 --> 00:47:28,551
She ain't here.

569
00:47:28,801 --> 00:47:32,589
We gotta go get you ready
for the finals tonight.

570
00:47:32,841 --> 00:47:37,551
I don't care about the finals.
I want Cherry! Cherry!

571
00:47:38,241 --> 00:47:41,233
He don't give up that easy.

572
00:47:41,481 --> 00:47:46,680
I'm gonna end up in Montana
with him and a bunch of cows.

573
00:47:47,201 --> 00:47:48,634
What are you doing?

574
00:47:48,841 --> 00:47:52,914
We'll stash your suitcase at the club
for a quick getaway.

575
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:56,073
That's the first place he'll look.

576
00:47:56,321 --> 00:48:00,314
If you don't show up for work,
you won't get an advance.

577
00:48:00,561 --> 00:48:03,598
He's in the rodeo.
You're safe till it's over.

578
00:48:03,841 --> 00:48:07,117
Tell that cashier you gotta
have money...

579
00:48:07,361 --> 00:48:09,829
...for your sick grandmother.

580
00:48:10,081 --> 00:48:13,835
- My grandmother?
- I don't understand that boy.

581
00:48:14,081 --> 00:48:17,869
- What's he got on his mind?
- Me.

582
00:48:18,601 --> 00:48:21,832
I'm gonna find her,
and I'm gonna marry her!

583
00:48:22,081 --> 00:48:25,437
Get her off your mind
till after the rodeo.

584
00:48:25,681 --> 00:48:28,036
I ain't gonna be
in the rodeo tonight.

585
00:48:28,281 --> 00:48:32,593
If you go to the rodeo,
I'll find her and hold her for you.

586
00:48:32,841 --> 00:48:37,437
I'm not saying she'll marry you,
but she'll be at the Blue Dragon.

587
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:40,434
- Okay, Virge, if you promise.
- I promise.

588
00:48:40,921 --> 00:48:45,836
My poor old grandmother's
sick. If I could just have an advance.

589
00:48:46,081 --> 00:48:47,673
The boss has to okay it.

590
00:48:47,921 --> 00:48:51,550
He'll be back when the rodeo's over.

591
00:48:51,801 --> 00:48:56,875
- Her grandmother'll be dead by then.
- Let's have a little drink.

592
00:48:57,121 --> 00:49:00,830
Come on.
I'm so dry, I'm spitting cotton.

593
00:49:01,081 --> 00:49:05,632
Two whiskeys, miss.
Take it easy, I'm on your side.

594
00:49:06,121 --> 00:49:09,033
I don't want him to marry you, neither.

595
00:49:09,841 --> 00:49:11,911
- You don't?
- I sure don't.

596
00:49:14,401 --> 00:49:17,552
I ain't good enough for him?
Is that it?

597
00:49:17,801 --> 00:49:19,519
I didn't say that.

598
00:49:20,561 --> 00:49:25,919
- Suppose he's as pure as driven snow.
- As a matter of fact, he is.

599
00:49:27,321 --> 00:49:28,959
You trying to tell me...

600
00:49:29,201 --> 00:49:33,274
He never even kissed a gal
before he met you.

601
00:49:33,521 --> 00:49:37,594
He spent his whole life
pretty far out in the country.

602
00:49:38,001 --> 00:49:42,438
I know what happens there.
I'm from the country myself.

603
00:49:42,641 --> 00:49:44,711
I've been kissing boys since...

604
00:49:44,961 --> 00:49:49,318
That's it. You're kind
of sophisticated for Bo.

605
00:49:50,521 --> 00:49:53,593
He didn't kiss like it was
the first time.

606
00:49:53,841 --> 00:49:57,720
Well, Bo picks things up real quick.

607
00:49:58,761 --> 00:50:01,878
- First time?
- That's right.

608
00:50:03,361 --> 00:50:06,717
Sure ain't never had
that honor before.

609
00:50:11,841 --> 00:50:15,914
I hate to put you through this,
but I promised I'd keep you here.

610
00:50:16,161 --> 00:50:20,712
But I didn't say anything about
where you might go after that.

611
00:50:22,121 --> 00:50:25,113
Vera's sure gonna miss you, honey.

612
00:50:25,361 --> 00:50:27,511
Oh, what was I supposed to say?

613
00:50:28,521 --> 00:50:32,753
- I never was good at lying.
- It ain't that complicated.

614
00:50:33,001 --> 00:50:38,029
We just talk to him a while,
then you turn casually and say:

615
00:50:38,281 --> 00:50:40,715
"The show is gonna start pretty soon.

616
00:50:40,961 --> 00:50:43,919
I guess I better go powder my nose".

617
00:50:46,281 --> 00:50:50,115
Then you go to your dressing room
where your suitcase is.

618
00:50:50,361 --> 00:50:55,719
You change, climb out the window
and get down to the bus station.

619
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:02,718
The rodeo must be over.
Where's Bo?

620
00:51:02,961 --> 00:51:04,030
I know what.

621
00:51:04,281 --> 00:51:09,150
He's probably yelling and pushing
some helpless animal around.

622
00:51:09,401 --> 00:51:12,074
Whatever gave you an idea like that?

623
00:51:13,481 --> 00:51:18,077
Nice to see you. I was afraid
you got trampled in that crowd.

624
00:51:18,681 --> 00:51:23,755
- Where you been, Bo?
- I had a couple of errands to run.

625
00:51:24,201 --> 00:51:27,830
I bought us three tickets
for tonight's bus to Montana.

626
00:51:30,321 --> 00:51:31,720
By the way...

627
00:51:32,321 --> 00:51:36,553
...there's $4000 I got for winning
every event at the rodeo.

628
00:51:36,801 --> 00:51:41,113
Except steer wrestling.
They gave me a bum steer.

629
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:47,719
Don't give me credit for that.
Another fella thought it up.

630
00:51:49,401 --> 00:51:50,516
Well...

631
00:51:51,521 --> 00:51:55,196
...our gear's packed and waiting
outside in the taxi.

632
00:51:55,441 --> 00:51:58,911
We'll stop by Cherry's house
and get her suitcase.

633
00:52:00,161 --> 00:52:03,710
Your nose is kind of shiny,
ain't it, Cherie?

634
00:52:09,121 --> 00:52:10,474
Oh!

635
00:52:12,601 --> 00:52:17,800
Bo, the show is gonna start
in just a minute...

636
00:52:20,961 --> 00:52:24,033
...and I gotta go powder my nose.

637
00:52:26,761 --> 00:52:30,037
Wait, you're not gonna
do your show tonight.

638
00:52:30,281 --> 00:52:33,751
- I ain't?
- You gotta go pack your suitcase.

639
00:52:34,001 --> 00:52:35,912
It's already packed...

640
00:52:37,361 --> 00:52:41,877
I mean, I gotta go powder my nose.

641
00:52:42,121 --> 00:52:45,909
Cherry, what's the matter with you?
Are you sick?

642
00:52:46,801 --> 00:52:51,670
No, I ain't sick, Bo.
I just can't lie to you.

643
00:52:51,921 --> 00:52:55,470
I can't marry you.
I ain't going to Montana with you.

644
00:52:57,161 --> 00:53:01,598
- And goodbye forever.
- Cherry, wait a second. Cherry!

645
00:53:04,321 --> 00:53:07,757
You ain't got the manners
they give a monkey!

646
00:53:08,001 --> 00:53:12,950
I hate you and I despise you!
And give me back my tail!

647
00:53:21,361 --> 00:53:23,795
- Cherry!
- Here's your bag.

648
00:53:24,281 --> 00:53:26,431
- Here's your coat and hat.
- Cherry!

649
00:53:26,681 --> 00:53:29,434
You can change down
at the bus station.

650
00:53:29,681 --> 00:53:34,072
I didn't mean to rip your tail off.
You can sew it back on.

651
00:53:35,161 --> 00:53:37,311
Good luck, honey.

652
00:53:39,321 --> 00:53:42,074
Thanks, vera, you've been real sweet.

653
00:53:42,321 --> 00:53:43,834
Let her go, Bo.

654
00:53:44,081 --> 00:53:49,109
What do you mean, let her go?
Where's she going? Cherry!

655
00:53:53,761 --> 00:53:55,319
Where'd she go?

656
00:54:14,201 --> 00:54:16,078
Los Angeles, please. One way.

657
00:54:16,961 --> 00:54:18,917
$9.35.

658
00:54:20,601 --> 00:54:22,432
Los Angeles bus at Gate 2.

659
00:54:22,681 --> 00:54:25,832
Wait a minute.
Help me unload this stuff.

660
00:54:26,201 --> 00:54:29,876
Forget her, Bo.
You'll find somebody else.

661
00:54:30,121 --> 00:54:32,874
Hank told me about this
new schoolmarm...

662
00:54:33,121 --> 00:54:36,909
I don't want no schoolmarm!
I want Cherry.

663
00:54:38,361 --> 00:54:40,272
Cherry! Cherry!

664
00:54:40,521 --> 00:54:44,594
You just can't take people
places. There's laws against it.

665
00:54:45,521 --> 00:54:51,521
- Which way is the Los Angeles bus?
- Here's your bus, lady. Through there.

666
00:54:51,761 --> 00:54:54,195
Miss, to the rear of the line.

667
00:54:57,441 --> 00:54:59,875
Cherry, don't get on that bus!

668
00:55:00,121 --> 00:55:04,512
I made up my mind.
I ain't gonna take no for an answer.

669
00:55:07,401 --> 00:55:08,959
Miss, stand to the rear.

670
00:55:09,201 --> 00:55:11,078
What are you doing?

671
00:55:11,321 --> 00:55:15,553
Anything I ever wanted in this life
I went out and got!

672
00:55:19,801 --> 00:55:22,873
If the ocean was whisky
And I was a duck

673
00:55:23,401 --> 00:55:28,191
I'd swim to the bottom
And never come up

674
00:55:28,481 --> 00:55:33,919
Rye whisky, rye whisky, rye whisky
I cry

675
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:39,201
If I don't get rye whisky
I surely will die

676
00:55:39,401 --> 00:55:43,792
So if I get boozy
My whisky's my own

677
00:55:43,961 --> 00:55:48,830
And them that don't like me
Can leave me alone

678
00:55:49,001 --> 00:55:53,950
Rye whisky, rye whisky, rye whisky
I cry

679
00:55:54,121 --> 00:55:59,479
If I don't get rye whisky
I surely will die

680
00:55:59,641 --> 00:56:02,109
I'll eat when I'm hungry
I'll drink when...

681
00:56:04,881 --> 00:56:08,510
I'm sorry to wake you,
but could you help me?

682
00:56:08,761 --> 00:56:12,754
- What's the matter?
- I'm being abducted.

683
00:56:13,121 --> 00:56:17,911
- Abducted?
- You know, kidnapped. By him.

684
00:56:21,081 --> 00:56:25,313
Oh, that's awful.
What are you gonna do?

685
00:56:26,721 --> 00:56:32,273
I thought when we got someplace,
I'd ask the driver to let me off.

686
00:56:32,521 --> 00:56:38,521
But we've been riding for hours.
We still ain't no place at all.

687
00:56:39,161 --> 00:56:41,914
Not only that, I'm freezing to death.

688
00:56:42,161 --> 00:56:44,516
I don't have much on under my coat.

689
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:47,556
You mean just your underthings?

690
00:56:47,801 --> 00:56:53,801
No, it's my costume, but it's just
a little old thing, without its tail.

691
00:56:54,441 --> 00:56:55,715
Its what?

692
00:56:56,601 --> 00:56:57,954
Lts...

693
00:56:58,321 --> 00:57:00,630
It's a long story.

694
00:57:00,881 --> 00:57:02,712
You're shivering.

695
00:57:03,281 --> 00:57:05,715
Don't you have anything warm
to put on?

696
00:57:06,801 --> 00:57:09,315
- Will you help me change?
- Of course.

697
00:57:09,761 --> 00:57:13,720
- Here, hold this up for me, will you?
- Sure.

698
00:57:29,361 --> 00:57:32,671
Cherry? Cherry, where are you?
Cherry!

699
00:57:33,161 --> 00:57:35,629
Cherry? What's going on up here?

700
00:57:35,881 --> 00:57:38,793
Get away from me!
I'm getting dressed.

701
00:57:39,041 --> 00:57:43,239
You've caused enough trouble
for one night. Sit down!

702
00:57:55,241 --> 00:57:58,916
I can't figure it out.

703
00:57:59,161 --> 00:58:02,073
Why don't she like me? Why?

704
00:58:03,321 --> 00:58:08,111
Of course, if you loved him,
it wouldn't be so bad.

705
00:58:08,361 --> 00:58:11,433
Yeah, but I don't.

706
00:58:12,321 --> 00:58:14,437
Not at all?

707
00:58:18,401 --> 00:58:24,192
Some gals don't like to be
pushed and grabbed and lassoed...

708
00:58:24,441 --> 00:58:28,434
...and drug into buses
in the middle of the night!

709
00:58:30,321 --> 00:58:33,836
How else was I gonna
get her on the bus?

710
00:58:35,241 --> 00:58:37,357
Well, I'm asking you.

711
00:58:38,441 --> 00:58:40,432
Go to sleep!

712
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:49,158
I don't know why I keep expecting
myself to fall in love, but I do.

713
00:58:49,401 --> 00:58:52,438
I know I expect to someday.

714
00:58:53,361 --> 00:58:57,752
I'm beginning to wonder if there's
the kind of love I have in mind.

715
00:58:57,961 --> 00:59:01,431
- What's that?
- I don't know.

716
00:59:03,041 --> 00:59:07,159
See, I've been going with guys
since I was about 12.

717
00:59:07,401 --> 00:59:08,470
Honest?

718
00:59:08,721 --> 00:59:13,158
I almost married my cousin when I
was 14. Pappy wouldn't have it.

719
00:59:13,401 --> 00:59:16,234
I never heard of marrying so young.

720
00:59:16,441 --> 00:59:20,036
Down in the Ozarks
we don't waste much time.

721
00:59:21,201 --> 00:59:24,796
I sure am glad I never married
my cousin Malcolm...

722
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:29,592
...because he turned out real bad,
just like Pappy predicted.

723
00:59:29,841 --> 00:59:33,720
But I sure was crazy
about him at the time.

724
00:59:33,961 --> 00:59:38,239
And I've been losing my head
about some guy ever since.

725
00:59:39,321 --> 00:59:43,439
Bo's the first one
that ever wanted to marry me...

726
00:59:43,761 --> 00:59:46,275
...since my cousin Malcolm.

727
00:59:47,201 --> 00:59:53,197
Naturally, I'd like to get married
and have a family and all them things.

728
00:59:53,441 --> 00:59:56,035
But you've never been in love?

729
00:59:57,121 --> 00:59:58,634
I don't know.

730
00:59:59,881 --> 01:00:02,998
Maybe I have and I didn't know it.

731
01:00:03,201 --> 01:00:06,910
That's what I mean.
Maybe I don't know what love is.

732
01:00:15,481 --> 01:00:20,635
I want a guy I can look up to
and admire.

733
01:00:23,001 --> 01:00:26,232
But I don't want him to browbeat me.

734
01:00:27,001 --> 01:00:30,835
I want a guy who'll be sweet with me.

735
01:00:31,481 --> 01:00:34,598
But I don't want him
to baby me, either.

736
01:00:34,801 --> 01:00:36,632
I just gotta feel it.

737
01:00:37,201 --> 01:00:42,150
Whoever I marry has some real
regard for me...

738
01:00:42,401 --> 01:00:45,120
...aside from all that...

739
01:00:45,321 --> 01:00:47,312
...loving stuff.

740
01:00:47,921 --> 01:00:51,880
- You know what I mean?
- I think so.

741
01:00:59,801 --> 01:01:02,838
This storm is getting terrible.

742
01:01:04,281 --> 01:01:06,954
There's Grace's lights. We'll make it.

743
01:01:08,401 --> 01:01:11,040
You can sneak off when I get off.

744
01:01:12,321 --> 01:01:15,631
I can if that wild man don't wake up.

745
01:01:16,121 --> 01:01:18,112
I wish I had my chains on.

746
01:01:37,561 --> 01:01:42,760
That's as close as I can get.
We'll have to walk from here.

747
01:01:57,241 --> 01:02:02,235
You sure picked some night
for traveling. Come on in.

748
01:02:10,921 --> 01:02:14,470
This is Cherie. We need
someplace for her to hide.

749
01:02:14,721 --> 01:02:16,200
She's being abducted.

750
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:19,672
- She's what?
- You know, kidnapped!

751
01:02:19,921 --> 01:02:23,675
Yes, that's right.
By a man in the bus. A cowboy.

752
01:02:23,921 --> 01:02:29,234
If I could stay here till the bus
pulls out again, I'd appreciate it.

753
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:31,349
Bus ain't leaving.

754
01:02:31,601 --> 01:02:35,833
- Huh?
- Road's closed. The bus is staying.

755
01:02:36,321 --> 01:02:40,314
It may take the highway gang
the rest of the night.

756
01:02:40,561 --> 01:02:42,313
The rest of the night!

757
01:02:43,081 --> 01:02:45,959
Driver, are we staying here?

758
01:02:46,201 --> 01:02:48,874
My aunt and uncle are meeting us.

759
01:02:49,121 --> 01:02:54,912
Don't you think we ought to wake
those cowboys up too? It's cold.

760
01:02:57,161 --> 01:03:01,439
- Well, look what the cat dragged in.
- Hi, Grace.

761
01:03:01,681 --> 01:03:04,559
Who's that with you?
Aren't they cute?

762
01:03:04,801 --> 01:03:06,519
They're visiting their aunt.

763
01:03:06,761 --> 01:03:11,073
Looks like they'll visit their
Aunt Grace. For tonight, anyway.

764
01:03:11,321 --> 01:03:17,237
Everybody is.
Highway's all closed up ahead.

765
01:03:18,321 --> 01:03:20,630
Oh, now, ain't that too bad.

766
01:03:20,881 --> 01:03:24,396
I hear you're carrying
a kidnapper on your bus.

767
01:03:25,961 --> 01:03:28,236
You mean that cowboy?

768
01:03:28,521 --> 01:03:32,400
He ain't kidnapping nobody.
He's asleep.

769
01:03:32,641 --> 01:03:34,836
He'll freeze out there. Wake him up.

770
01:03:35,081 --> 01:03:39,757
Oh, no! Couldn't you let him
sleep longer? He's had a busy day.

771
01:03:40,001 --> 01:03:42,879
Two rodeos and a lot else.

772
01:03:43,601 --> 01:03:48,595
Sure, let him sleep. Works out
better for everybody that way.

773
01:03:48,841 --> 01:03:53,517
- How soon is the next bus back?
- Ain't no buses tonight.

774
01:03:53,761 --> 01:03:58,152
You're all stuck right here.
For the time, anyway.

775
01:04:02,361 --> 01:04:04,272
You know something?

776
01:04:04,521 --> 01:04:09,151
This is the first time we've
had more than five minutes together.

777
01:04:09,361 --> 01:04:13,274
- So what?
- I don't know.

778
01:04:13,521 --> 01:04:16,354
I was thinking about
that apartment upstairs.

779
01:04:16,601 --> 01:04:22,233
Sure would be nice to sit up there
and listen to the radio.

780
01:04:22,521 --> 01:04:25,433
Maybe have a couple of beers.

781
01:04:25,841 --> 01:04:28,480
That wouldn't be a hint, would it?

782
01:04:28,721 --> 01:04:33,841
Elma! Where's this place
we're at now, anyway?

783
01:04:35,241 --> 01:04:38,950
Here. It's so little,
it's not even on the map.

784
01:04:43,401 --> 01:04:46,916
I sure am way off my direction.

785
01:04:48,401 --> 01:04:51,552
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.

786
01:04:51,801 --> 01:04:56,636
Your hands. You got real big hands.

787
01:04:58,001 --> 01:05:02,631
I'm big all over. I used to be
all-state wrestling champ.

788
01:05:02,881 --> 01:05:07,272
No kidding? I always admire
a man who can fight.

789
01:05:07,681 --> 01:05:12,675
Hey! Why didn't anybody wake us up?
We might've froze!

790
01:05:12,921 --> 01:05:14,639
Hey, close the door!

791
01:05:20,321 --> 01:05:21,549
Cherry!

792
01:05:25,641 --> 01:05:29,395
- How come you didn't let me know?
- Shut the door!

793
01:05:29,721 --> 01:05:34,272
How come you slip off the bus
and come in here by yourself?

794
01:05:34,521 --> 01:05:38,150
- Where was you brought up, in a barn?
- He was!

795
01:05:40,041 --> 01:05:43,238
What's the matter,
afraid of a little fresh air?

796
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:45,199
Man's right, it's cold out.

797
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:48,831
Don't give him no right
to insult my manners.

798
01:05:49,121 --> 01:05:52,830
No man ever had to tell me what
to do, did he, Virge?

799
01:05:53,081 --> 01:05:57,438
You opened the door,
you should've closed it. That's all.

800
01:05:58,961 --> 01:06:02,237
Door's closed now,
so what you arguing about?

801
01:06:03,081 --> 01:06:06,039
Cherry, let's you and me sit down...

802
01:06:06,641 --> 01:06:08,279
That's your suitcase.

803
01:06:08,521 --> 01:06:11,558
For crying out loud,
will you leave me be?

804
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:17,034
- Ain't that your suitcase?
- Yes, that's my suitcase.

805
01:06:18,001 --> 01:06:20,231
What'd you bring it in here for?

806
01:06:20,601 --> 01:06:26,233
I'm asking you a simple question.
What did you bring it in here for?

807
01:06:26,481 --> 01:06:29,120
- Keep away from me, Bo.
- Will you...?

808
01:06:29,361 --> 01:06:32,512
Keep out of this.
This is between me and Cherry.

809
01:06:32,721 --> 01:06:36,509
Was you trying to fool me again?
Is that what it was?

810
01:06:36,761 --> 01:06:39,434
- Take your hands off of me!
- Tell me.

811
01:06:40,161 --> 01:06:43,870
- You tell me!
- Okay, cowboy, leave the lady alone.

812
01:06:44,121 --> 01:06:48,956
You better keep out of this too.
It ain't none of your business.

813
01:06:49,201 --> 01:06:50,429
I ain't so sure.

814
01:06:51,121 --> 01:06:54,193
A bus driver's like
the captain of a ship.

815
01:06:54,401 --> 01:06:57,677
The welfare of the passengers
is his responsibility.

816
01:06:57,921 --> 01:07:00,913
- Anything happens in the bus...
- We ain't in a bus!

817
01:07:01,161 --> 01:07:06,838
We're in a bus stop. This here's
an official, authorized bus stop!

818
01:07:07,201 --> 01:07:09,271
- Ain't it?
- When the sign's up.

819
01:07:09,521 --> 01:07:13,958
You still can't interfere between
two people gonna get married!

820
01:07:14,201 --> 01:07:19,673
We ain't getting married,
but you're too bullheaded to listen!

821
01:07:19,921 --> 01:07:25,632
Cherry, you're gonna marry me,
and I ain't gonna discuss it no more.

822
01:07:25,881 --> 01:07:30,557
- Is there a preacher around here?
- Down the road, but he's asleep.

823
01:07:30,801 --> 01:07:33,873
We're gonna wake him up
and put him to work.

824
01:07:34,121 --> 01:07:35,315
Help!

825
01:07:35,561 --> 01:07:39,076
Shut up. I'll make you a good husband.

826
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:44,076
- Now, cowboy, put her down.
- Open the door, Virge.

827
01:07:44,361 --> 01:07:45,999
Virge, open the door.

828
01:07:46,401 --> 01:07:49,234
I ain't gonna open it, Bo.

829
01:07:49,481 --> 01:07:51,711
- You ain't?!
- No.

830
01:07:51,961 --> 01:07:54,395
You been against this
from the start!

831
01:07:54,641 --> 01:07:58,919
That's right. I figured
she wasn't good enough for you.

832
01:07:59,161 --> 01:08:01,914
Now I figure you ain't
good enough for her!

833
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:07,793
- You're gonna put her down?
- You're gonna get out of my way!

834
01:08:08,761 --> 01:08:12,549
- You'll have to fight me first.
- I love a good fight.

835
01:08:12,801 --> 01:08:14,871
I can't stand a bully.

836
01:08:15,121 --> 01:08:17,999
- Who says I'm a bully?
- I do!

837
01:08:18,481 --> 01:08:22,599
Quiet! A man's got to fight
for what he wants!

838
01:08:22,841 --> 01:08:26,436
There's a difference
between a fighter and a bully!

839
01:08:26,681 --> 01:08:32,074
But you'll only learn that if someone
beats the living tar out of you.

840
01:08:32,321 --> 01:08:37,236
Go to it. He's ripe for it.
I'd do it myself if I was big enough.

841
01:08:37,801 --> 01:08:40,998
But you ain't big enough!

842
01:08:41,801 --> 01:08:44,031
And neither is he!

843
01:08:45,401 --> 01:08:50,031
Ain't no man ever got the best of me,
and there ain't gonna be!

844
01:08:50,241 --> 01:08:52,277
I'm willing to try, cowboy.

845
01:08:54,281 --> 01:08:56,431
Just step outside.

846
01:08:58,641 --> 01:09:01,235
Delighted!

847
01:09:02,961 --> 01:09:04,474
Make them stop!

848
01:09:06,561 --> 01:09:11,919
Save yourself a lot of trouble.
Go in there and tell her you're sorry.

849
01:09:12,161 --> 01:09:16,120
- I ain't sorry!
- He never is, that's his trouble!

850
01:09:16,361 --> 01:09:20,957
I've had enough of you telling me
what's right and wrong!

851
01:09:21,201 --> 01:09:24,637
No, you ain't!
You can stand a little bit more!

852
01:09:25,961 --> 01:09:28,998
Virge! What are you doing?

853
01:09:29,241 --> 01:09:32,995
I'm starting a fight.
He's gonna finish it for me.

854
01:09:33,241 --> 01:09:37,029
Remember, every time he hits you,
it's me hitting you.

855
01:09:37,281 --> 01:09:41,718
- Do you hear that? It's me!
- And it'll be me hitting you back!

856
01:09:42,401 --> 01:09:44,676
Move over, I'm getting cold.

857
01:09:54,561 --> 01:09:57,314
You're doing great, mister!

858
01:09:57,561 --> 01:10:01,395
- Gouge him, cowboy. Bite him.
- Make them stop.

859
01:10:01,641 --> 01:10:06,669
Come away from this window.
You don't wanna watch things like that...

860
01:10:06,921 --> 01:10:12,075
...or you're gonna grow up mean,
just like all my brothers and cousins.

861
01:10:12,321 --> 01:10:16,633
Sit down and behave yourselves.
You ought to be in bed.

862
01:10:16,881 --> 01:10:19,714
Grace has a big bed upstairs,
and a sofa too.

863
01:10:28,601 --> 01:10:32,640
All right, boys,
lay off them gas pumps.

864
01:10:39,761 --> 01:10:42,036
Had enough, kid?

865
01:10:43,081 --> 01:10:46,471
Go put your coat on.
This is getting good.

866
01:10:46,721 --> 01:10:48,393
Cherry...

867
01:10:57,641 --> 01:11:02,032
Oh, Virge, make them stop
before somebody gets killed!

868
01:11:03,801 --> 01:11:08,431
Give up! Come on, give up.
You ain't got a chance.

869
01:11:10,881 --> 01:11:15,671
- You had enough?
- No, he has to apologize to everybody.

870
01:11:15,921 --> 01:11:18,355
And quit molesting that little girl!

871
01:11:18,601 --> 01:11:22,674
- You heard what he said?
- Bo, you're whipped, admit it.

872
01:11:22,921 --> 01:11:25,037
Okay.

873
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:28,115
- Bo?
- Get away, damn it!

874
01:11:34,121 --> 01:11:36,874
How about the promise, Bo?

875
01:11:37,121 --> 01:11:40,193
- Is she gone?
- She's gone.

876
01:11:40,441 --> 01:11:43,797
- Okay, I promise.
- All right.

877
01:11:45,281 --> 01:11:48,079
He'll be all right.

878
01:11:48,321 --> 01:11:51,950
Come on, Bo, the storm is over.

879
01:11:59,441 --> 01:12:03,593
I'm sorry it had to be
like this. It's all over now.

880
01:12:03,841 --> 01:12:08,278
Come on inside and wash up.
Get some coffee.

881
01:12:08,841 --> 01:12:11,639
Come on. You can't stay out here.

882
01:12:11,881 --> 01:12:13,792
I can't go in there.

883
01:12:14,041 --> 01:12:18,000
She seen me get whipped.

884
01:12:21,321 --> 01:12:25,792
Carl, honey,
you was just plain tremendous.

885
01:12:29,201 --> 01:12:33,479
But I think I earned a cold beer
you've got in the icebox...

886
01:12:33,681 --> 01:12:35,034
...upstairs.

887
01:12:42,161 --> 01:12:45,631
Snowplow's out.
Shouldn't be too much longer.

888
01:12:46,721 --> 01:12:52,398
Come on, Bo, cheer up.
We'll be back on the ranch tomorrow.

889
01:12:52,641 --> 01:12:56,077
I don't care if I ever see
that ranch again.

890
01:12:56,401 --> 01:13:01,839
Lonesomest place I ever did see.
Just like going back to a graveyard.

891
01:13:07,561 --> 01:13:12,351
- Morning, honey.
- They're sleeping just fine.

892
01:13:12,601 --> 01:13:16,389
Must've read myself to sleep.
Such an interesting story.

893
01:13:16,641 --> 01:13:20,759
- Can I have a cup of coffee?
- Elma just run it through.

894
01:13:21,801 --> 01:13:24,554
- Bo?
- Yeah?

895
01:13:24,801 --> 01:13:28,510
This would be a good time
to keep your promise.

896
01:13:29,041 --> 01:13:33,239
- Why should you be so scared?
- Who's scared? I'm gonna do it.

897
01:13:33,441 --> 01:13:35,238
Just give me a little time.

898
01:13:35,481 --> 01:13:40,601
I warn you, it ain't gonna do no good
unless you really mean it.

899
01:13:40,841 --> 01:13:43,639
- I mean it.
- All right, then.

900
01:13:44,961 --> 01:13:46,838
Go ahead.

901
01:13:55,801 --> 01:13:59,840
Ma'am, I want to apologize.

902
01:14:00,081 --> 01:14:04,836
- For what?
- For causing all that ruckus.

903
01:14:05,561 --> 01:14:08,234
You don't need to apologize to me.

904
01:14:08,481 --> 01:14:14,192
I love a good fight. You're welcome
at Grace's Diner anytime.

905
01:14:14,441 --> 01:14:18,832
- I mean anytime.
- Thanks.

906
01:14:31,801 --> 01:14:35,874
I must've acted like a hoodlum.
I apologize.

907
01:14:36,121 --> 01:14:40,239
- That's all right.
- Thank you, miss.

908
01:14:48,041 --> 01:14:52,432
- Have I got to wake him up?
- No, he can wait.

909
01:15:04,561 --> 01:15:08,520
Virge, I can't do it.
I just can't do it!

910
01:15:08,761 --> 01:15:12,640
- Why not?
- She seen me get beat.

911
01:15:12,881 --> 01:15:16,760
You made me your promise.
You owe that girl an apology...

912
01:15:17,001 --> 01:15:22,553
...and you're gonna say it to her.
Now go on, Bo. Go on!

913
01:15:22,801 --> 01:15:25,031
Well, don't watch!

914
01:15:26,801 --> 01:15:29,269
- I'll do the dishes.
- I can do them.

915
01:15:29,521 --> 01:15:32,831
No, you go on with
the kids' breakfast.

916
01:15:36,041 --> 01:15:37,838
Cherry?

917
01:15:38,681 --> 01:15:40,637
Yes?

918
01:15:42,601 --> 01:15:44,432
Cherry...

919
01:15:45,121 --> 01:15:50,718
...wasn't right of me to do what
I did to you, treating you that way.

920
01:15:50,961 --> 01:15:55,273
Trying to make you marry me
whether you wanted to or not.

921
01:15:55,921 --> 01:15:58,640
Do you think you can ever forgive me?

922
01:16:03,441 --> 01:16:06,831
I guess I've been treated worse
in my life.

923
01:16:10,601 --> 01:16:14,833
Well, I reckon that's all there is
to be said.

924
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:22,833
- I wish you luck, Cherry.
- I wish you the same, Bo.

925
01:16:32,681 --> 01:16:34,831
Here's your bandana back.

926
01:16:36,481 --> 01:16:38,233
Thanks.

927
01:16:41,481 --> 01:16:42,834
Oh...

928
01:16:46,401 --> 01:16:48,437
Here's your ring.

929
01:16:49,881 --> 01:16:52,236
I wish you'd keep that.

930
01:16:57,001 --> 01:16:59,231
All right, Bo.

931
01:17:00,481 --> 01:17:04,679
- Well, so long.
- So long.

932
01:17:06,161 --> 01:17:10,916
- Wasn't so bad. Have some breakfast.
- I ain't hungry.

933
01:17:11,161 --> 01:17:13,800
- Just have some coffee.
- I couldn't get it down.

934
01:17:15,921 --> 01:17:19,118
- Phone!
- Turn the water off, honey.

935
01:17:20,481 --> 01:17:24,838
Grace's Diner. What?

936
01:17:25,321 --> 01:17:28,631
Oh, it is? Okay, I'll tell him.

937
01:17:31,001 --> 01:17:34,994
Hate to wake him,
but the road's cleared. Hey, Carl!

938
01:17:35,241 --> 01:17:36,799
The road's cleared.

939
01:17:37,041 --> 01:17:40,397
But put your chains on.
Still awful slick.

940
01:17:41,601 --> 01:17:45,833
Elma? Elma, better wake the kids up.

941
01:17:46,801 --> 01:17:51,192
Bus will be ready to leave
just as soon as I get my chains on.

942
01:17:52,601 --> 01:17:54,831
Anybody wanna help me?

943
01:17:55,321 --> 01:17:57,835
Sit here, Bo. I'll help him.

944
01:18:13,281 --> 01:18:15,033
Bo?

945
01:18:16,241 --> 01:18:18,038
Yeah?

946
01:18:22,481 --> 01:18:25,041
I wanted to tell you something.

947
01:18:25,241 --> 01:18:28,836
It's kind of personal,
and embarrassing too.

948
01:18:31,641 --> 01:18:35,429
But I ain't the kind of girl
you thought I was.

949
01:18:36,721 --> 01:18:39,030
What do you mean, Cherry?

950
01:18:41,521 --> 01:18:47,153
Well, I guess a lot of people'd say
I've led a real wicked life.

951
01:18:47,401 --> 01:18:50,234
And I guess I have too.

952
01:18:51,201 --> 01:18:54,477
What are you trying to tell me?

953
01:19:01,881 --> 01:19:06,671
I just figure that since you met me
at the Blue Dragon...

954
01:19:06,921 --> 01:19:12,921
...that you took it for granted that
I'd had other boyfriends before you.

955
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:16,032
You had?

956
01:19:18,561 --> 01:19:20,392
Yes, Bo.

957
01:19:21,281 --> 01:19:23,431
Quite a few.

958
01:19:25,441 --> 01:19:30,834
Virge tried to tell me that,
but I wouldn't believe him.

959
01:19:32,121 --> 01:19:36,637
Well, it's true. So you can see...

960
01:19:40,321 --> 01:19:42,630
You're better off.

961
01:19:42,881 --> 01:19:47,238
I ain't the kind of gal
you thought I was at all.

962
01:20:02,601 --> 01:20:04,432
Cherry...

963
01:20:05,121 --> 01:20:09,637
...would I be molesting you
if I was to tell you something?

964
01:20:09,881 --> 01:20:11,439
No.

965
01:20:13,041 --> 01:20:16,431
Well, since you brought
the subject up...

966
01:20:17,081 --> 01:20:21,233
...you are the first gal
I ever had anything to do with.

967
01:20:22,041 --> 01:20:25,829
I never thought I'd hear
myself saying that, but I said it.

968
01:20:28,121 --> 01:20:33,514
Virge told me that, but I couldn't
hardly believe him.

969
01:20:33,761 --> 01:20:35,638
It's the truth.

970
01:20:36,041 --> 01:20:39,829
You see, I've lived all my life
on a ranch.

971
01:20:40,081 --> 01:20:43,835
I guess I just didn't know anything
about women.

972
01:20:44,241 --> 01:20:48,598
- 'Cause they're different from men.
- Well, naturally.

973
01:20:54,721 --> 01:20:57,235
All ready to roll, folks.

974
01:21:00,361 --> 01:21:02,829
Feeling better, cowboy?

975
01:21:03,081 --> 01:21:06,790
Ain't the happiest critter
that's ever been born.

976
01:21:07,041 --> 01:21:11,432
I feel a little shook-up myself.
How about shaking hands?

977
01:21:12,721 --> 01:21:15,997
Go ahead. He's just trying
to be friends.

978
01:21:16,241 --> 01:21:17,230
I don't mind.

979
01:21:17,481 --> 01:21:20,518
- No hard feelings?
- No hard feelings.

980
01:21:24,001 --> 01:21:29,359
There's a nice state, miss. Montana.
How about a cup of coffee, Grace?

981
01:21:29,601 --> 01:21:33,310
- Nice fella, Bo.
- Maybe I'll think so someday.

982
01:21:33,561 --> 01:21:36,234
Maybe we better be boarding the bus.

983
01:21:42,601 --> 01:21:44,432
Cherry?

984
01:21:46,001 --> 01:21:48,231
Hi, Bo.

985
01:21:49,041 --> 01:21:53,239
Cherry, you won't be getting
on this bus.

986
01:21:53,641 --> 01:21:57,236
I know that I promised
not to molest you.

987
01:21:57,481 --> 01:22:01,554
But if you'd give your permission
that it'd be all right...

988
01:22:02,921 --> 01:22:06,231
...I'd like to kiss you goodbye.

989
01:22:06,481 --> 01:22:09,439
I'd like for you to kiss me, Bo.

990
01:22:11,441 --> 01:22:13,636
I really would.

991
01:22:16,241 --> 01:22:17,879
- Whoa!
- What?

992
01:22:18,121 --> 01:22:21,830
I think this time
it ought to be different.

993
01:22:51,801 --> 01:22:53,632
Golly.

994
01:22:55,561 --> 01:22:59,440
When you kiss somebody
for serious...

995
01:22:59,921 --> 01:23:03,231
...it's kind of scary, ain't it?

996
01:23:05,401 --> 01:23:09,440
Yes, it is.

997
01:23:38,761 --> 01:23:42,470
- Here they are, all breakfasted.
- I'm still hungry.

998
01:23:42,721 --> 01:23:46,555
- See you Wednesday.
- Keep that beer on ice, Grace.

999
01:23:46,801 --> 01:23:50,032
Maybe next time
I'll get a chance to finish it.

1000
01:23:52,041 --> 01:23:55,158
All aboard! Come on, kids.

1001
01:23:55,401 --> 01:23:59,474
I turned down the heater.
Throw this water on the fire.

1002
01:23:59,721 --> 01:24:03,236
This bus stop is closed as of now.

1003
01:24:05,441 --> 01:24:07,238
Cherry?

1004
01:24:08,241 --> 01:24:09,640
Yes?

1005
01:24:10,921 --> 01:24:13,481
Virge has been figuring things out.

1006
01:24:13,721 --> 01:24:19,721
He says that seeing as how you had all
them other boyfriends before me...

1007
01:24:20,161 --> 01:24:25,076
...seeing as I never even had
one single gal friend before you...

1008
01:24:25,321 --> 01:24:31,321
...he figures that between the two
of us it kind of averages out...

1009
01:24:31,641 --> 01:24:36,590
...to things being proper and right.

1010
01:24:40,241 --> 01:24:45,838
That's what virge thinks.
What do you think, Bo?

1011
01:24:55,521 --> 01:25:00,879
I've been thinking
about them other fellas, Cherry.

1012
01:25:01,121 --> 01:25:05,672
Well, what I mean is,
I like you the way you are...

1013
01:25:05,921 --> 01:25:09,436
...so what do I care
how you got that way?

1014
01:25:18,241 --> 01:25:20,801
Oh!

1015
01:25:22,001 --> 01:25:27,633
That's the sweetest, tenderest thing
anyone ever said to me.

1016
01:25:36,921 --> 01:25:40,516
It's hard for a fellow
after he's been turned down...

1017
01:25:40,761 --> 01:25:43,753
...to get up enough guts to try again.

1018
01:25:46,561 --> 01:25:49,837
You don't need guts, Bo.

1019
01:25:52,081 --> 01:25:57,678
- I don't?
- That's the last thing you need.

1020
01:26:01,721 --> 01:26:05,430
Anyhow, I just don't have any now.

1021
01:26:07,001 --> 01:26:12,439
So I just have to tell you
what I feel in my heart.

1022
01:26:15,041 --> 01:26:17,077
Yes?

1023
01:26:18,481 --> 01:26:23,236
I still wish you was
going back to the ranch with me.

1024
01:26:25,041 --> 01:26:30,354
- You do?
- Yeah, I do.

1025
01:26:32,721 --> 01:26:35,872
I'd go anywhere in the world
with you now.

1026
01:26:37,121 --> 01:26:39,715
Anywhere at all.

1027
01:26:41,681 --> 01:26:44,912
- You would?
- Anywhere at all.

1028
01:26:45,601 --> 01:26:49,674
- You would?
- Yes, I would.

1029
01:26:51,121 --> 01:26:54,955
- You would!
- I would, I would, I would.

1030
01:26:55,561 --> 01:26:59,156
- You would?
- I would.

1031
01:27:02,121 --> 01:27:04,635
Yes, I would. I would.

1032
01:27:04,881 --> 01:27:08,317
Virge. Virge, she...

1033
01:27:10,401 --> 01:27:12,710
She's gonna marry me!

1034
01:27:12,961 --> 01:27:16,476
Ain't it wonderful when somebody
so terrible turns out so nice?

1035
01:27:16,681 --> 01:27:20,754
Our ranch is gonna be
the nicest place in the world!

1036
01:27:21,001 --> 01:27:23,469
We're gonna have an angel on it.

1037
01:27:23,721 --> 01:27:26,394
- Here's your map.
- Here's your bag.

1038
01:27:26,641 --> 01:27:30,953
- This old thing!
- I'll show you the way to Montana.

1039
01:27:32,801 --> 01:27:36,191
Captain! You got yourself
another passenger!

1040
01:27:36,441 --> 01:27:39,001
- Come on, Virgil.
- Wait a second.

1041
01:27:39,241 --> 01:27:42,472
Come on, we wasted
enough time already.

1042
01:27:42,721 --> 01:27:48,591
- What you waiting for?
- You hush for a second! Hear me!

1043
01:27:48,841 --> 01:27:51,878
- Bo, I ain't going.
- You ain't what?

1044
01:27:52,121 --> 01:27:54,430
You don't need me to look after you.

1045
01:27:54,681 --> 01:27:58,833
Fact is, you got someone
you gotta look after.

1046
01:27:59,521 --> 01:28:01,830
Here's your wedding ring.

1047
01:28:04,161 --> 01:28:09,189
Virge, I wish you'd come. I liked you
long before I ever liked Bo.

1048
01:28:09,441 --> 01:28:13,832
- Folks, gotta get rolling.
- The bus can't wait all day.

1049
01:28:14,081 --> 01:28:18,359
Virge! You're my buddy.
I ain't gonna let you go.

1050
01:28:18,561 --> 01:28:21,758
You're coming with us.
We want you to!

1051
01:28:22,001 --> 01:28:24,595
- Bo!
- Let me be. Let me be.

1052
01:28:25,161 --> 01:28:28,119
You can't do it that way. You can't.

1053
01:28:28,321 --> 01:28:31,472
If he don't wanna come,
you can't make him.

1054
01:28:36,401 --> 01:28:41,111
Whatever I got left up there,
the boys can have it.

1055
01:28:52,241 --> 01:28:55,392
- Goodbye, Bo.
- Come on, Cherry, let's make it fast.

1056
01:28:58,121 --> 01:29:04,121
Why, you're liable to freeze
to death in that skimpy little thing.

1057
01:29:40,321 --> 01:29:43,677
But what about you?
You need something.

1058
01:29:51,241 --> 01:29:53,675
Yippie!

1059
01:30:08,761 --> 01:30:11,321
Bye, everybody. Bye!

1060
01:30:11,641 --> 01:30:13,074
Bye.
