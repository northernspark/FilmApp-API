2
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:38,895
For me?

3
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,694
Okay. So, which one do you want?

4
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,692
These ones.

5
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,281
Come here.

6
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,528
Which one? This one?

7
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:48,609
No, these ones.

8
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:49,944
This one?

9
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,199
Yes.

10
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:52,450
Other foot, other foot.

11
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:53,865
Give me that one.

12
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,533
Heels. I think you're too young to wear heels.

13
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,711
- I know.
- Let me see.

14
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,079
Beautiful.

15
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,717
It's okay.

16
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,435
Whatever you do, don't smile.

17
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:23,436
Whatever you do, don't laugh.

18
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:49,762
You stay young and high for so long

19
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:55,388
that one day you look back and you realize

20
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:57,936
you're all alone.

21
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,433
Help gone,

22
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:01,690
and what's left?

23
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,357
Nothing.

24
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,437
Thank you for sharing, Melissa.

25
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:10,157
Anyone else?

26
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,205
Hi, I'm Ashley.

27
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,866
Hi, Ashley.

28
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,494
I lost everything too.

29
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,916
Because of meth.

30
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,759
They said I was an unfit mother.

31
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,557
Took away my little girl.

32
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,513
Every time I do it I think,

33
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:43,311
"This is the last time. I can control this."

34
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:49,898
And I do it again and again and again.

35
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,607
I just can't...

36
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,244
I just can't stop.

37
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,831
I like it too much.

38
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,786
Living one day at a time.

39
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,543
Enjoying one moment at a time.

40
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:12,503
Trusting that You'll make all things right if I surrender to Your will.

41
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,884
- Amen.
- Amen.

42
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,435
Ashley.

43
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,471
I haven't seen you in a while.

44
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:24,602
You Okay?

45
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,733
You clean?

46
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,688
How long?

47
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:34,366
A month.

48
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:38,529
Like, two days.

49
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,042
If I can't do this,

50
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,454
then I don't get my daughter back, and if I...

51
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:48,629
I know.

52
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,173
It's not easy.

53
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,926
Have you heard of this book?

54
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,379
The Purpose Driven Life?

55
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,222
Yeah. I have.

56
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:58,803
It can help.

57
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,767
It helped me.

58
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,479
Ashley, you can't do this alone.

59
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,519
If you need me, call.

60
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,186
Thanks.

61
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,508
Come on.

62
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,123
Face the wall, Mr. Nichols.

63
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,499
Eyes front.

64
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,936
Step inside, please.

65
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,396
Don't wanna keep Judge Barnes waiting.

66
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:36,697
That suit there is compliments of your attorney.

67
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,924
Officer Hall down, cell block.

68
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,138
Please send a medic.

69
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,470
Prisoner escaped. 10-23 in progress!

70
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,652
Mr. Nichols, what are you doing?

71
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,464
Stop!

72
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,270
Suspect northwest service corridor.

73
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,441
In pursuit.

74
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:41,609
Stop!

75
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,783
Stop! Out of the way!

76
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,599
I hate this car.

77
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:49,732
Okay.

78
00:10:58,908 --> 00:10:59,909
Gosh!

79
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,245
Love you too!

80
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,797
Come on! Go.

81
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,505
Have a nice day.

82
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:28,067
Right now the search is on for a suspect after a judge, a court reporter

83
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:31,400
and a deputy are shot dead at an Atlanta courthouse.

84
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,905
We're following developments in this breaking story.

85
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:36,488
Right now, police looking for this man.

86
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:39,074
From the CNN Center in Atlanta, I'm Miles O'Brien.

87
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:40,204
And I'm Kyra Phillips.

88
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,752
This hour of CNN's Live Room starts right now.

89
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,917
Let's just bring you up to date on what's going on.

90
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:48,216
An intensive manhunt all throughout the city of Atlanta

91
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:51,716
as they look for this suspect involved in this multiple shooting

92
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,422
at the Fulton County Superior Courthouse.

93
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,591
Brian Nichols is the suspect,

94
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,642
and he is apparently at loose in the city at large.

95
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,304
You're late, Ashley. Third time this week.

96
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,022
If it happens again,

97
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,107
I'm gonna have to put you on weekends only.

98
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,527
Randy, you wouldn't do that to me.

99
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:08,941
It'd break my heart.

100
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:10,776
Hold on.

101
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,275
Lady dropped this off for you.

102
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,753
Lieutenant Chestnut. Meredith MacKenzie, TV 7 News.

103
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,251
Could you tell us how the shooter was able to breach courthouse security

104
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,833
and kill three people?

105
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,422
I'm going on a national in two minutes.

106
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:34,049
Well, good luck with that.

107
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:42,971
Two deputies called in sick.

108
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:45,148
Deputy Cynthia Hall was alone with Brian Nichols

109
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:46,520
when he attacked her in the holding cell.

110
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,192
I know Cynthia.

111
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,898
How bad was she hurt?

112
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,313
She's in a coma.

113
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,442
He took her gun,

114
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,118
came in here.

115
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,445
One, two.

116
00:12:58,528 --> 00:12:59,529
Where was the bailiff?

117
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,205
On a clerical errand for the judge.

118
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,323
Any Priors?

119
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,330
Minor, until a rape charge.

120
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,460
A disorderly and a drug possession.

121
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,836
Played college football.

122
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,289
Two-year degree in electronics.

123
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:10,749
Had two good jobs.

124
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,836
What kind of time was he looking at?

125
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,171
25 years.

126
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,597
Department's on full tactical.

127
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,267
We have got to get this guy back into custody.

128
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,393
Not unless one of ours gets to him first.

129
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,900
I know. We've set up an emergency task force.

130
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,148
Chief wants you to take lead.

131
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,064
Commander, the press is ready for you.

132
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,482
You got to fix this, John.

133
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,737
Let's get started on Nichols right away.

134
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:44,495
Friends, girlfriends, former employers, everybody.

135
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,772
Well, he grew up in Baltimore.

136
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,649
He lived in Florida, he lived in Atlanta.

137
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,028
He knows his way around

138
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,198
if he can get to some of these other communities.

139
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:20,618
But my bet right now is that he stayed in that local area.

140
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,575
He stays in the area that he knows.

141
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,997
Try to let some of the heat come off.

142
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:29,123
And this may turn out to not only be the biggest manhunt in Georgia,

143
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,749
but the biggest manhunt in America.

144
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:28,849
Yeah, it's okay.

145
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,337
This the rape victim?

146
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,014
No, this is the one he had a child with.

147
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,386
Lynn Campbell.

148
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,560
I can't keep it straight with these women.

149
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,562
Thank God you're here!

150
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,644
Ms. Campbell, Sergeant Carmen Sandoval.

151
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,100
This is Lieutenant John Chestnut.

152
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,394
Has Brian Nichols tried to contact you in any way?

153
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,895
- No.
- You sure?

154
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,442
Of course I'm sure.

155
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,733
After I found out what he did to his ex,

156
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,277
I have refused to have anything to do with him.

157
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,253
Look at this little guy.

158
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,133
What's his name?

159
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:44,175
- Christopher.
- Hi, Chris.

160
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,806
Did you know any of Brian's friends?

161
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,436
Places where he would go?

162
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,607
He never really opened up to me much.

163
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,775
Other than work and the gym,

164
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,477
I don't know where else he would go.

165
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:01,772
- Any guesses?
- I told you, I don't know.

166
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,737
It's just that he might have divulged information without meaning to.

167
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,280
Like I said, I don't know.

168
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,445
Look, we're gonna leave these two officers here with you.

169
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,622
- Sound good?
- It does.

170
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,204
Is it all right if we look around?

171
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:16,828
Of course, sure.

172
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,634
Thank you.

173
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,514
- Mommy!
- Baby girl!

174
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,391
Mommy, guess what?

175
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,978
I took care of the baby ducks in school!

176
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,483
Lucky girl!

177
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:43,442
I came to drop off the balance of your first month's rent.

178
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:44,522
Thank you, Aunt Kim.

179
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:45,694
You're a sweetheart to do that.

180
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,988
Well, remember, this is a loan. I expect you to pay me back.

181
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,159
Yeah. I will.

182
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,661
Like all the other times?

183
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,946
I said I would.

184
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:56,000
Mommy, I got a pretty dress for the Mommy Daughter Show tomorrow.

185
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,040
I bet I'm gonna love it.

186
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,331
Order up.

187
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,176
Can I see your new house, Mommy? Please?

188
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:07,049
Please.

189
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,467
Hey, sweetie, I'm gonna give you a quarter.

190
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,925
Why don't you run over and get some gum, okay?

191
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:15,266
This Mommy Daughter Fashion Show is important to her.

192
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,476
It's all she's talked about for days.

193
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,728
You need to be there by 9:30, not a minute later.

194
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,609
Don't you roll your eyes at me!

195
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:25,154
You are her mother and you need to start acting like it.

196
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,448
You've broken just about every promise you've ever made to her.

197
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,525
I will be there at 9:30.

198
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,527
Thank you for the loan.

199
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,412
Man! Great.

200
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:38,918
We'll brush it off.

201
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:45,299
Reports have come in that as many as four different vehicles

202
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,422
have been stolen over the last several hours.

203
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,462
All units, be on the lookout

204
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:54,142
for a stolen 2004 light blue Mercury Grand Marquis,

205
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:59,973
Georgia tags 1-Sam-John-Adam-4-4-George.

206
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:05,486
Vehicle is currently believed to be driven by murder suspect Brian Nichols.

207
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,562
You look at the actions of the suspect, Brian Nichols,

208
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:41,935
in the triple courthouse homicide...

209
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:46,064
What do you think the personality profile of a man like this is?

210
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,987
Well, you know, I've listened to friends and relatives say,

211
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:50,861
you know, he was really a nice guy when he grew up.

212
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,534
He was a nice kid, he was big, nobody messed with him.

213
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,488
But, you know, people did mess with him, the system did.

214
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,914
The system said he couldn't abuse his girlfriend,

215
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,993
he couldn't tie her up in duct tape, he couldn't assault her,

216
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:03,544
he couldn't carry a machine gun.

217
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,543
This is a guy who didn't like to be told, "No."

218
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:10,047
And, when the system finally said, "We're gonna make you pay for this,"

219
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:12,128
it sounds like this sociopath...

220
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:06,643
Hey, Aunt Kim.

221
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,806
Ashley, I wanted to apologize for earlier.

222
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:11,231
I wasn't very nice.

223
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,521
No, it's okay.

224
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:14,856
No, it's not.

225
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:17,530
I was rude and unfair.

226
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,356
What's that noise?

227
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,657
Are you at a party?

228
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:21,988
No, no.

229
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,829
I'm just unpacking and I'm playing my music.

230
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:29,958
Well, I just wanted you to know I am proud of you, Ash.

231
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,919
You've been working really hard,

232
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:34,838
and we're gonna get there.

233
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:38,008
Thank you, Aunt Kim. That means a lot.

234
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:43,798
I've got someone here who wants to talk to her mommy.

235
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:46,054
Here you go.

236
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:47,844
Mommy?

237
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,887
Hey. Baby girl!

238
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:51,727
If it's okay, Mommy,

239
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:55,189
Aunt Kim said we can come to your new house.

240
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,643
Yeah.

241
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:58,854
Yeah, baby, that sounds great.

242
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:01,524
We're going to go to Mommy's house tomorrow.

243
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,318
- Mommy said it was okay.
- Yay.

244
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,028
That's such good news!

245
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,828
Listen, I got a lot to get through

246
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:11,500
if you're gonna come by,

247
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:13,999
so I'll see you soon.

248
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:15,671
I'll say my prayers for you.

249
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:17,043
I love you.

250
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:20,047
I love you, too. Bye-bye, sweetheart.

251
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:24,680
We'll see you in the morning, honey.

252
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,055
Yep. 9:30.

253
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,257
Bye.

254
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:41,234
Any word on the Mercury?

255
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:42,444
Nothing yet, sir.

256
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,825
Brian Nichols' mother.

257
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:46,902
Line six.

258
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,119
Hello, Ms. Nichols, thank you for returning my call.

259
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:56,541
I called two days ago,

260
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,247
warning the Sheriff's Department about him.

261
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:00,295
Anyone tell us about this?

262
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:03,427
I told them what Brian's friends said.

263
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:04,632
If things didn't go his way,

264
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,346
how he might act out in court and hurt someone.

265
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,594
Why didn't anyone listen?

266
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,767
Has he tried to contact you, Ms. Nichols?

267
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,596
He knows better than to call me after this.

268
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,766
Is there anything you could tell me that will help us find him?

269
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:18,563
No, sir.

270
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:23,777
That girl he violated,

271
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,942
he was with her for seven years.

272
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:29,571
She was like a daughter to me.

273
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,285
I don't want anyone else getting hurt.

274
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:37,078
I'll be praying for you.

275
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,917
Thank you for calling, Ms. Nichols.

276
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,411
Help me!

277
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,754
You scream again, and I will have to kill you.

278
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,593
Please.

279
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,767
- Who else lives here?
- No one.

280
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,440
Get up.

281
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:13,863
Where's the child?

282
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:15,827
Lives somewhere else.

283
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,459
What's in there?

284
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,459
Open it. Open it.

285
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,712
You said the child doesn't live here.

286
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:36,674
It's my surprise for her. She's coming tomorrow.

287
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,103
- Get in the tub.
- God, please, no, please.

288
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:47,309
Get in.

289
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,362
Look at me.

290
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,827
I said, look at me.

291
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:03,534
You been watching TV today?

292
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:08,543
- I have a daughter...
- Put your hands out.

293
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:09,877
She's five years old. If you hurt me...

294
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,463
Put your hands out. Cross your wrists.

295
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,021
Sit down. Sit down!

296
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:27,854
My name is Ashley Smith. I'm a mother.

297
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,519
Your phone. Where is it?

298
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:33,405
The land line's not hooked up yet.

299
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,575
I don't trust you.

300
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,369
Do not move.

301
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,704
If you do, I will hurt you.

302
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,650
Your daughter did this?

303
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,289
Kim Rogers.

304
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,458
Who's she?

305
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:11,829
My aunt.

306
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,589
This where the kid stays?

307
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,643
I can't give you any information.

308
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:28,978
It's as simple as that.

309
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:35,811
We're not comfortable with any of this either, Doctor.

310
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:38,856
Now, I understand and appreciate your position,

311
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:42,196
but if we knew Brian's psychology better,

312
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,948
it would help us immeasurably.

313
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:46,329
Three people are dead, Dr. Pratt.

314
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:54,421
Mr. Nichols has episodes of paranoia,

315
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:56,544
defensiveness, emotional distance,

316
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,421
and he doesn't believe that he actually

317
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,252
committed the rape that he's accused of.

318
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,461
Come on.

319
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:03,138
Every criminal walks through my door

320
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:05,090
swears on their mother's grave they didn't do it.

321
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:08,268
This man genuinely doesn't believe he committed the crime.

322
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,811
It shows the depth of his denial.

323
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,105
And you didn't see this coming when you were examining him?

324
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,854
The man was deeply in denial.

325
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:28,155
On TV, they said you played college football?

326
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,489
Get up.

327
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:44,429
No, no, no, no. No.

328
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:46,181
No, no, no.

329
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,425
You don't have to do this.

330
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,303
You have any children?

331
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:54,722
Yeah.

332
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,809
Baby DOV-

333
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,475
Newborn.

334
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:07,364
I didn't know till I found out from my lawyer three days ago.

335
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,034
They wouldn't even tell me his name.

336
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,196
Why?

337
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,741
Same old stuff.

338
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,995
Always trying to grind me down.

339
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,379
No one wants to listen.

340
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,753
I didn't rape anyone.

341
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:29,086
What happened?

342
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:32,881
My lady cheated on me with a minister from our church.

343
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,429
Can you believe that? A minister.

344
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:41,564
She was mad because I got another lady friend pregnant.

345
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,897
But I went to her house to apologize,

346
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,897
and I'd had a lot to drink.

347
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:53,406
But I did not do those things they say I did.

348
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:02,744
I loved her.

349
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,810
My husband has some clothes you could wear.

350
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:28,941
Husband?

351
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:32,031
He's coming home at 6:00.

352
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,776
He works the night shift.

353
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,325
You said no one else lives here.

354
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:41,041
No, I said no one else was here now.

355
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,623
Are you lying?

356
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:47,547
Why would I lie?

357
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:50,960
Would you prefer I didn't say anything and then he walks in here?

358
00:36:57,716 --> 00:37:00,890
I guess we'll all have to get acquainted at 6:00 then, won't we?

359
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:05,561
Your husband's clothes, where are they?

360
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,652
In a box in my bedroom closet.

361
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,668
You have my number.

362
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:28,045
Feel free to call me.

363
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:39,512
We found the Mercury Marquis Nichols stole earlier abandoned up the street.

364
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:43,102
Can you tell how far the shooter was from Mr. Wilhelm?

365
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:45,930
About here.

366
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:49,730
From the angle of the wound, Agent Wilhelm was on his knees.

367
00:37:58,026 --> 00:37:59,653
Never got to hit "Send."

368
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,074
What'd she say?

369
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:07,502
She was bringing him supper when she found him like this.

370
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:12,215
Said he always carried a Glock, even off-duty.

371
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,216
Yeah, we found the holster.

372
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:17,299
Notify the FBI Field Office.

373
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,096
Let them know Wilhelm was a customs agent.

374
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:20,514
And while you're at it,

375
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,719
see if you can locate the jail video of Nichols' attack on Deputy Hall.

376
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:26,680
Besides her gun, let's see if he took anything else.

377
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:43,739
My family doesn't listen to me, either.

378
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:00,255
They think I'm a liar.

379
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,427
They don't trust me.

380
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:04,635
That's good to know.

381
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:20,108
He took her radio.

382
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,568
You were right.

383
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,112
I usually am.

384
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:30,585
Department is offering a $65,000 reward

385
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,747
for any information that would lead to the capture of Brian...

386
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:46,968
Brian Nichols.

387
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:52,057
This is Lieutenant John Chestnut from the Atlanta Police Department.

388
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:56,565
We know you have Deputy Hall's radio,

389
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,988
and we know you've been monitoring us.

390
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:05,112
It's time we had a talk, Brian.

391
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,959
You're an intelligent man. We can work this out.

392
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:17,256
Anything?

393
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:18,879
Nothing yet. Get him talking.

394
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:24,797
I met your son today.

395
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,393
You know, a son is something to be proud of.

396
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,846
Truly one of life's blessings.

397
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:39,855
I know you wanna meet little Christopher.

398
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,740
I mean, the boy looks just like you.

399
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:55,544
You hear me, brother?

400
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:01,842
You are not my brother.

401
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:05,088
That's right, Brian, I'm not.

402
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:09,559
I saw you and your posse at my lady friend's house.

403
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,638
Sorry we missed you.

404
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,190
You've got a $65,000 reward out on me.

405
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,608
Whole damn city's locked down

406
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:19,394
and you still can't find me.

407
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,192
Yeah, you're right about that, Brian.

408
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:25,408
Just trying to do our job, you know?

409
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:28,699
Haven't enough people died today?

410
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:35,043
Be a tragedy if you never met Christopher.

411
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:37,412
Never got to hold him.

412
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:42,258
Because, truth be told, you're not getting out of here.

413
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:44,461
So turn yourself in,

414
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:47,593
and I promise you, you will meet your son.

415
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,599
You and I both know that's not the way it goes.

416
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:53,307
You kill a cop, a cop kills you.

417
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,471
I give you my word, that's not gonna happen.

418
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:57,060
Don't lie to me!

419
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:59,058
Look, Brian, the longer you stay out there,

420
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:01,486
the harder it's gonna be for me to keep that promise.

421
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,272
But the quicker you end this,

422
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:06,946
the sooner you get to see Christopher.

423
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:35,641
How close?

424
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,055
About a three-mile radius,

425
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:39,186
North Gwinnett to the county line.

426
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,975
Best I can do.

427
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:46,485
You did good.

428
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,278
Not good enough.

429
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,821
He knows everything we're doing.

430
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,990
He's holed up somewhere with a TV.

431
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:59,036
Get our people over to Gwinnett and alert the local P.D.

432
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,543
Beg for as much air support as we can get.

433
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,212
Media still hanging around?

434
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:13,558
If she's out there, find that reporter, Meredith MacKenzie.

435
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:15,852
- I wanna talk to her.
- Okay.

436
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:33,156
You got any weed?

437
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:38,574
Hey-

438
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:41,870
You got any weed?

439
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:43,914
I need to relax.

440
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:47,424
I don't.

441
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:52,381
Come on, I know you have something here, party girl.

442
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,762
What you got?

443
00:43:58,219 --> 00:43:59,220
Ashley.

444
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:03,691
Don't mess with me. What do you got?

445
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:09,693
I have ice.

446
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:12,526
What's that?

447
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:17,034
Meth.

448
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,452
Well, let's break it out.

449
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,936
Ladies first.

450
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:18,550
Come on, let's go.

451
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:21,310
No.

452
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,100
What do you mean, "No"?

453
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,893
You go ahead and do it if you want, but I won't.

454
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:46,805
Miss MacKenzie.

455
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,189
Please have a seat.

456
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,856
We wanna give you an exclusive.

457
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:00,409
We need you to broadcast something for us.

458
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,074
You can help us flush Nichols out.

459
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:04,201
When?

460
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:09,953
We are being told at this point that nobody else in the courthouse

461
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:12,505
knew what was going on inside that courtroom,

462
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:16,676
despite the fact that this man had already shot the sheriff's deputy

463
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:18,253
in another part of the complex.

464
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:22,049
So it's a very disturbing, tragic, confusing story.

465
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:25,886
The fact is, three people are dead, one in the hospital in critical condition,

466
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:27,845
and this man, who, if and when he's caught,

467
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:30,397
could possibly face the death penalty here in Georgia,

468
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:32,396
is still on the loose. Kyra.

469
00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:34,694
Gary Tuchman outside the courthouse there, thanks so much.

470
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:36,646
What time you say your husband was coming?

471
00:47:36,729 --> 00:47:38,731
- 6:00?
- Yes.

472
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:40,612
Yeah, that's good! That's good.

473
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:42,944
Gonna be ready. We're in a war.

474
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:46,323
And I'm a soldier! I am a soldier for my people.

475
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:50,122
You can't enslave me! You can't shackle me!

476
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:52,294
That's right, I am Brian Nichols!

477
00:47:52,453 --> 00:47:53,955
All bus and train stations will remain closed...

478
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,590
You better shut the buses and the trains down.

479
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:57,796
I got it, I got it.

480
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,255
We're gonna go to Mexico.

481
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:01,008
Gonna get that truck, we're gonna go to Mexico,

482
00:48:01,087 --> 00:48:02,714
we're gonna rob the banks, we're gonna pick up Christopher

483
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:03,798
and we're gonna go to Mexico.

484
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,258
What's your daughter's name?

485
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:06,467
- Paige.
- Paige, that's right.

486
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,927
We're gonna pick up Paige and Christopher...

487
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,229
Hey, Brian, I gotta use the bathroom.

488
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:11,601
Go for it, you use the bathroom.

489
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,227
Everybody's gotta use the bathroom.

490
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,309
We all gotta use the bathroom. Use the bathroom.

491
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:16,610
We gotta get that truck, though.

492
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,858
What are you doing?

493
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:21,323
I can't go with the door open.

494
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,993
All right, I'll turn around.

495
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:26,662
No, I can't go with you standing there.

496
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:28,664
I don't trust you, Ashley.

497
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:31,785
- I don't trust you, Ashley.
- Okay.

498
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:33,828
So what are we gonna do?

499
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:36,918
You're gonna talk, all right?

500
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,920
I'm gonna shut the door and you're gonna talk. All right?

501
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,000
Yeah, okay.

502
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:41,590
Hold on!

503
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:44,755
I said we're gonna go to Mexico.

504
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:45,931
We're gonna get that truck.

505
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:47,929
We're gonna go to Mexico, gotta rob the bank though.

506
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:49,601
Understand? Where we going, Ashley? Where we going?

507
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:50,803
- Mexico.
- That's right.

508
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:54,439
The knife!

509
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:55,770
Give me the knife!

510
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:01,985
Talk, all right?

511
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:09,738
Oh, my God.

512
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:11,324
God, please help me.

513
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:14,542
I can't hear you!

514
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:29,554
Ashley, I can't hear you!

515
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:30,725
Okay.

516
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:32,557
What do you want me to say?

517
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:34,230
Should I say the alphabet?

518
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:35,397
That'll work.

519
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:38,143
Okay. A, B, C...

520
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:41,821
D, E, F, G...

521
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:48,411
H, I, J...

522
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:52,915
Keep going, Ashley!

523
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:58,083
K, L, M, N...

524
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:02,333
Keep going!

525
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:09,591
It's weird to talk and pee.

526
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:11,429
Talk about...

527
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,595
Talk about your husband.

528
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:22,437
He's two years older than me and we met in high school.

529
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:28,529
He works at Amalgamated Container.

530
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:32,662
What else?

531
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:37,543
How am I supposed to go to the bathroom

532
00:50:37,618 --> 00:50:39,370
if you keep asking me questions?

533
00:50:40,204 --> 00:50:41,922
What's taking so long?

534
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:45,880
Who have you got in there?

535
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,053
- I can hear people in there.
- What?

536
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,477
What did you...

537
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,650
What did you put in that stuff?

538
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:03,978
You put something in that stuff.

539
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,153
No.

540
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:12,157
Why didn't you take it?

541
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:16,495
Why didn't you take it?

542
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,453
Take it. Come on, take it.

543
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:22,754
Take it.

544
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:27,050
No.

545
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:28,468
What?

546
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:31,597
Do you want to live?

547
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:33,470
- Do you want to live?
- I do.

548
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:34,596
Then take it.

549
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:39,521
No.

550
00:51:43,726 --> 00:51:44,773
Do it.

551
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:12,565
What is that? What are you doing?

552
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:15,863
It's just a book.

553
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,118
What book?

554
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,240
The Purpose Driven Life.

555
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:25,957
I didn't say you could read.

556
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:36,839
Read it.

557
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:45,435
Read it to me.

558
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,820
It all starts with God.

559
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:01,948
It's not about you.

560
00:54:02,114 --> 00:54:03,912
The purpose of your life is far greater

561
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:05,993
than your own personal fulfillment,

562
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:09,421
your peace of mind, or even your happiness.

563
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:12,709
It's far greater than your family, your career,

564
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:15,635
or even your wildest dreams and ambitions.

565
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:17,842
If you want to know why you were placed on this planet,

566
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,015
- "you must begin with God..."
- Stop.

567
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:26,017
That's a bunch of church crap.

568
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:31,352
Place is full of con artists and hustlers.

569
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:37,241
My dad went to church every Sunday, and he was a mean drunk.

570
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:54,716
I've got a demon in me.

571
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:27,666
Roadblocks north and south on Duluth Highway.

572
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:31,086
Peachtree west and east Rogers Bridge.

573
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:32,838
- We miss anything?
- Nope.

574
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:34,290
All roadblocks operational.

575
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:35,716
Aerial surveillance ready.

576
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:38,677
Get MacKenzie on the phone. Tell her it's showtime.

577
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:41,259
I want eyes in the sky. All choppers up now.

578
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:42,927
Copy that.

579
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:46,719
And now, we wait.

580
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:51,895
He's gonna be sorely missed.

581
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:54,193
He could teach judges a thing about

582
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:57,021
how to be a tough judge, but decent.

583
00:55:57,104 --> 00:56:00,825
He did not have what some lawyers refer to as "robe-itis,"

584
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:01,991
which just went to his head.

585
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:05,697
He was just an approachable, very, very decent, very smart man.

586
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:06,871
Brian.

587
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:09,325
Dennis Scheib, attorney-at-law here in Atlanta, Georgia...

588
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:11,831
I need to leave at 9:00 to see my daughter.

589
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,080
You're not going anywhere.

590
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:18,167
Next up, Channel 7's Meredith MacKenzie,

591
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:19,919
reporting from police headquarters.

592
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:22,221
The body of Federal Agent David Wilhelm

593
00:56:22,296 --> 00:56:24,173
was found at his home in Buckhead.

594
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,387
The FBI are now joining the investigation,

595
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:27,592
widening its scope.

596
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:29,808
Nichols is believed to be driving.

597
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:32,602
Agent Wilhelm's blue Chevy Silverado truck,

598
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:34,809
Georgia plate 5PXL456.

599
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:37,353
We got to get that truck out of here. Let's go.

600
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:39,484
Can I at least put on some warm clothes first?

601
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:40,606
Hurry UP!

602
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:43,571
Joins us now from the scene of the shooting of that customs agent

603
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,869
whose body was found earlier this morning.

604
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:46,911
Hurry UP!

605
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:48,989
Good morning to you, John. Bring us up to date.

606
00:56:49,156 --> 00:56:51,250
Good morning, Alex. This is a very active crime scene.

607
00:56:51,325 --> 00:56:53,419
Earlier this morning, we're not sure exactly when,

608
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,621
Atlanta police got a call that

609
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:57,877
there was a body of a man shot to death...

610
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:59,253
All I wanted was his truck,

611
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:00,801
and then he pulled his gun on me.

612
00:57:00,876 --> 00:57:02,219
It was his own fault.

613
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:03,804
About eight miles north of downtown Atlanta

614
00:57:03,879 --> 00:57:06,098
where the courthouse shootings occurred yesterday.

615
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:07,265
You can perhaps see some of the...

616
00:57:08,008 --> 00:57:09,055
Come on.

617
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:14,474
I saw some woods down the road.

618
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:15,773
Know where I mean?

619
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:16,896
I do.

620
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:19,482
You drive, I'll follow.

621
00:57:23,899 --> 00:57:25,071
I know where the child is.

622
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:27,903
Don't do anything you'll regret.

623
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:38,163
God.

624
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:44,942
No, no, no.

625
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:47,445
No.

626
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:04,791
Hey there.

627
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:06,797
You need some help?

628
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:11,423
Are you okay?

629
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:14,093
Yeah, it happens all the time. I can fix it.

630
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:31,990
Ma'am, are you sure you're all right?

631
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:33,620
Yeah, I got it.

632
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:49,678
Do we know each other from somewhere, man?

633
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:58,428
Thank you, sir. We appreciate it.

634
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:01,394
Bobby was just following me to make sure I got home safe.

635
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:11,734
You take care of yourself, ma'am.

636
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:14,570
Thank you.

637
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,583
The gate's shut.

638
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:02,913
Wait here.

639
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:01,642
Go.

640
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,196
Why did you do it?

641
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:27,002
Why'd you kill all those people?

642
01:02:36,503 --> 01:02:37,550
No.

643
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:41,512
IS this him?

644
01:02:43,051 --> 01:02:44,724
Mr. 6100?

645
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:52,064
Okay, just pull over

646
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:55,279
and act like anyone else would.

647
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:14,875
Okay, keep driving.

648
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:17,669
They're not looking for your car.

649
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:27,766
So, what's your husband's name?

650
01:03:30,724 --> 01:03:31,850
Mac.

651
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:35,194
"Big Mac."

652
01:03:38,398 --> 01:03:41,527
Guess Mac'll be home in around half an hour.

653
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:46,911
No.

654
01:03:50,285 --> 01:03:51,332
I lied.

655
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:55,006
He's not coming home.

656
01:03:59,586 --> 01:04:00,838
He's dead.

657
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:06,764
He was stabbed to death by a drug dealer.

658
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:12,106
I should've made him stay home that night.

659
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:16,145
If I had, he'd still be alive.

660
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:20,903
It's all my fault.

661
01:04:27,155 --> 01:04:28,532
I miss him.

662
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:57,648
They found Wilhelm's truck.

663
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:03,316
He slipped through, John.

664
01:05:54,284 --> 01:05:55,536
Is this you?

665
01:06:06,254 --> 01:06:09,053
You want any help with that?

666
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:11,551
No.

667
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:16,522
Anything I can do around here?

668
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:19,309
Well...

669
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:24,857
I mean, you could hang that mirror over there, if you want.

670
01:06:28,443 --> 01:06:30,116
You got any nails?

671
01:06:30,195 --> 01:06:31,492
It's right behind you.

672
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:50,265
This wall, right here?

673
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:50,407
Real butter.

674
01:07:58,199 --> 01:07:59,701
You can read it, if you like.

675
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:05,210
Okay.

676
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:19,345
Out loud.

677
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:25,234
"God deserves your best."

678
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:27,278
"He shaped you for a purpose,"

679
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:30,027
"and He expects you to make the most of what you have been given."

680
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:31,907
I haven't been given anything.

681
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:38,414
You have a son.

682
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:43,502
I'm never gonna see him again, am I?

683
01:08:46,748 --> 01:08:48,625
If you stop what you're doing and give yourself up,

684
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:49,880
maybe you will.

685
01:08:54,714 --> 01:08:55,931
Keep reading.

686
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:04,775
He doesn't want you to worry about or covet abilities you don't have.

687
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:07,068
Instead, He wants you to focus on talents.

688
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:08,395
He has given you to use.

689
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:14,067
When you attempt to serve God in ways you're not shaped to serve...

690
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,993
Fear is a self-imposed prison

691
01:09:16,069 --> 01:09:19,699
that will keep you from becoming what God intends for you to be.

692
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:23,918
You must move against it, and weapons of faith and love.

693
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:29,173
The Bible says, 'well-formed love banishes fear...

694
01:09:29,332 --> 01:09:33,712
Job said, ' My life drags by, day after hopeless day.

695
01:09:33,795 --> 01:09:36,639
And I give up, I'm tired of living.

696
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:39,513
Leave me alone, my life makes no sense.

697
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:43,103
He greatest tragedy is not death,

698
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:45,352
but life without purpose.

699
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:49,151
We were made to have meaning.

700
01:09:49,394 --> 01:09:51,442
A young man in his twenties wrote,

701
01:09:51,688 --> 01:09:52,814
I feel like a failure,

702
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:54,524
because I'm struggling to become something

703
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:56,780
and I don't even know what it is.

704
01:09:56,943 --> 01:09:59,366
All I know how to do is to get by.

705
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:01,915
Someday, if I discover my purpose,

706
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:04,083
I'll feel I'm beginning to live.

707
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:07,917
When life has meaning, you can bear almost anything.

708
01:10:08,246 --> 01:10:10,123
Without it, nothing is bearable.

709
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:12,633
When I heard I had a son...

710
01:10:20,133 --> 01:10:21,680
I had to break out.

711
01:10:25,012 --> 01:10:26,980
I don't belong in that place.

712
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:31,186
When I saw what they were trying to do to me,

713
01:10:31,269 --> 01:10:34,068
how that judge was trying to enslave me,

714
01:10:36,357 --> 01:10:38,030
I went into that courtroom

715
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:40,532
and I shot him dead.

716
01:10:42,029 --> 01:10:43,246
You know what?

717
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:47,828
It felt good.

718
01:10:54,542 --> 01:10:57,386
If I were the one who killed your husband,

719
01:11:00,548 --> 01:11:02,346
could you forgive me?

720
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:10,016
I don't know.

721
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:16,398
Maybe God can.

722
01:11:45,051 --> 01:11:47,520
Hey, it's Ashley. Leave a message.

723
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:49,935
Well, I guess you're in the shower.

724
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:51,561
Okay, well, we're leaving the house now,

725
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:53,018
so please don't be late.

726
01:11:53,184 --> 01:11:54,811
All right, we'll see you at 9:30 sharp.

727
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:56,729
Aunt Kim, come on, can we go?

728
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:59,908
Yeah, let's go meet your mama at the Fashion Show.

729
01:12:00,483 --> 01:12:02,201
You look so pretty!

730
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:30,392
Brian, it's time.

731
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:33,516
I have to leave now.

732
01:12:34,642 --> 01:12:36,736
I can't be late to see my daughter.

733
01:13:25,526 --> 01:13:27,073
I said, I have to go.

734
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:46,923
Okay, I'm leaving.

735
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:52,307
Paige needs me. I can't disappoint her again.

736
01:14:13,491 --> 01:14:14,538
Wait.

737
01:14:21,332 --> 01:14:22,834
You'll need this.

738
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:34,496
Come on!

739
01:15:53,632 --> 01:15:55,805
Don't you dare die on me.

740
01:15:57,928 --> 01:15:59,350
Gwinnett County, 911.

741
01:15:59,513 --> 01:16:01,356
Yes, my name is Ashley Smith.

742
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:03,358
The guy from the courthouse, Brian Nichols,

743
01:16:03,517 --> 01:16:06,521
he's been holding me hostage for the past seven hours.

744
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:08,064
He just let me go.

745
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:09,903
Hold on, let me get you the hotline number.

746
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:14,367
No, this isn't a tip. I was being held hostage...

747
01:16:14,528 --> 01:16:16,826
Ma'am, you need to start from the beginning.

748
01:16:17,865 --> 01:16:19,959
Brian Nichols is in my apartment,

749
01:16:20,034 --> 01:16:21,502
Bridgewater Apartments.

750
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:22,957
Please hold on.

751
01:16:25,498 --> 01:16:27,592
Miss Smith, this is Sergeant Evans.

752
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:28,963
We have your location.

753
01:16:29,043 --> 01:16:30,386
Stay where you are, we're sending a...

754
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:36,077
There is a man she is identifying as Nichols as being inside her house.

755
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:38,371
Now, once again, we do not have independent confirmation...

756
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:48,047
is talking about a woman in Duluth, Georgia,

757
01:17:48,122 --> 01:17:50,341
who has called the local police to say...

758
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:01,935
Visual on them, give me 20 feet.

759
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:03,596
You two, the second team.

760
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:10,983
So you're saying you didn't know him at all.

761
01:18:11,061 --> 01:18:12,153
No.

762
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:13,863
I didn't.

763
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:15,441
So Why'd he pick your apartment?

764
01:18:16,108 --> 01:18:17,075
I don't know.

765
01:18:17,151 --> 01:18:18,949
Were there any drugs involved?

766
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:22,956
Answer the question, yes or no?

767
01:18:23,866 --> 01:18:26,585
Yeah, there was ice. I didn't do any.

768
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:28,879
I don't care what you did or did not do, ma'am.

769
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:30,627
How long ago did Nichols use?

770
01:18:32,625 --> 01:18:34,468
About 4:00 a.m.

771
01:18:36,462 --> 01:18:38,180
All residents in a two-block radius...

772
01:18:39,465 --> 01:18:40,591
Paige!

773
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:42,722
Paige, stop!

774
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:46,517
Stop. Stop!

775
01:18:51,352 --> 01:18:54,105
They're gonna put a tighter circle around the apartment

776
01:18:54,188 --> 01:18:56,907
where they think that Nichols may be.

777
01:18:56,982 --> 01:19:00,236
If it is indeed Brian Nichols inside of this lady's house,

778
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:03,448
is this going exactly the way you had just hoped it would not,

779
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:05,123
but that you predicted it might?

780
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:09,666
This is the worst case scenario

781
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:13,625
as far as perhaps him being in a house with someone else.

782
01:19:13,707 --> 01:19:16,631
Sir. The landline to the apartment's up and running.

783
01:19:19,672 --> 01:19:21,925
If it's him, we've got him located someplace.

784
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:24,726
This case is breaking so fast, Alex,

785
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:27,806
it's hard to get a breath and it moves to a new phase.

786
01:19:27,888 --> 01:19:29,105
Hello?

787
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:31,024
Hello, Brian Nichols?

788
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:33,477
This is Lieutenant John Chestnut again.

789
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:36,530
The entire area that you're showing a shot of right now,

790
01:19:36,605 --> 01:19:39,529
nobody in, nobody out, but law enforcement.

791
01:19:46,865 --> 01:19:47,957
Busy.

792
01:19:51,829 --> 01:19:56,255
It becomes a road called 141, which takes you right into Duluth.

793
01:20:00,379 --> 01:20:02,097
I've got movement.

794
01:20:05,968 --> 01:20:07,891
Positive I.D. on the suspect.

795
01:20:09,346 --> 01:20:10,643
Permission to fire.

796
01:20:12,558 --> 01:20:14,981
This individual, Mr. Nichols, sounds like

797
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:18,155
he's been somewhat astute in his observations.

798
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:21,234
It sounds to me like he has stayed off main roads...

799
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:31,497
It's very accurate.

800
01:20:31,577 --> 01:20:33,545
We've got Meredith MacKenzie joining us now,

801
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:36,169
reporting live from Bridgewater Apartments.

802
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:39,009
The manhunt during the last 24 hours

803
01:20:39,084 --> 01:20:41,007
has kept the people of Atlanta in fear

804
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:42,929
from a killer with no conscience.

805
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:45,925
He's shooting, take cover!

806
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:48,761
What's going on?

807
01:20:48,886 --> 01:20:50,183
Okay, ma'am, I need you to stay back.

808
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:52,352
Brian Nichols!

809
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:55,609
Put down your weapon and come out of there with your hands in the air.

810
01:20:56,727 --> 01:20:59,901
Repeat, come out of there with your hands in the air!

811
01:21:00,439 --> 01:21:02,282
All rifles, maintain positions!

812
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:20,460
Brian Nichols.

813
01:21:21,085 --> 01:21:22,553
Time to end this.

814
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:24,638
Come out, and give yourself up.

815
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:27,641
You're completely surrounded, no way of winning.

816
01:21:28,634 --> 01:21:30,557
No need to prolong this situation.

817
01:21:46,944 --> 01:21:49,322
Go get that Smith woman. Maybe she could talk him out.

818
01:22:13,846 --> 01:22:15,519
Sorry I can't come to the phone right now.

819
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:18,271
Leave a message. I will get back to you as soon as I can.

820
01:22:19,435 --> 01:22:20,436
Lynn.

821
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:22,153
It's Brian.

822
01:22:24,857 --> 01:22:27,781
I wanted to leave a message for my little boy.

823
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:29,494
For Christopher.

824
01:22:30,362 --> 01:22:32,205
Please don't erase it.

825
01:22:32,823 --> 01:22:34,541
Please let him...

826
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:37,495
Let him listen to it, when he's old enough.

827
01:22:38,704 --> 01:22:40,798
Christopher, it's your daddy.

828
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,378
You're gonna hear some bad things about me.

829
01:22:47,379 --> 01:22:49,632
But, whatever happens,

830
01:22:49,715 --> 01:22:52,514
whatever people say, I just want you to know...

831
01:22:53,552 --> 01:22:55,099
I love you.

832
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:01,018
Goodbye, little man.

833
01:23:12,529 --> 01:23:13,701
What do you want me to say?

834
01:23:13,864 --> 01:23:16,367
Just say whatever you think is best.

835
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:21,297
We don't wanna have to go in there after him.

836
01:23:26,502 --> 01:23:27,503
Brian.

837
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:30,968
It's Ashley.

838
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:35,928
I came back.

839
01:23:41,558 --> 01:23:43,435
It's not too late, Brian.

840
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:49,612
Brian!

841
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:54,078
There is purpose in your life.

842
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:58,082
It's time.

843
01:24:01,954 --> 01:24:03,797
Do the right thing, Brian.

844
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:24,393
Thank you for trying.

845
01:24:25,936 --> 01:24:27,654
Get her to a safe place.

846
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:30,486
Officer.

847
01:24:44,329 --> 01:24:45,831
Okay, Brian, it's over.

848
01:24:46,665 --> 01:24:47,962
Last chance!

849
01:24:49,334 --> 01:24:51,336
You got exactly 30 seconds!

850
01:25:20,407 --> 01:25:21,954
He's coming out!

851
01:25:22,034 --> 01:25:24,287
- Hands in the air!
- Keep it up in the air!

852
01:25:24,369 --> 01:25:25,746
- Do you see him?
- Affirmative.

853
01:25:25,829 --> 01:25:26,830
Request permission to fire.

854
01:25:26,913 --> 01:25:28,130
Stand down!

855
01:25:28,206 --> 01:25:29,503
Nowhere to go, pal!

856
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:31,756
- Show your hands!
- Go, move!

857
01:25:31,835 --> 01:25:34,213
- Go, let's go!
- Move it, move it!

858
01:25:34,296 --> 01:25:35,843
- In position, right side!
- Faster, come on!

859
01:25:35,922 --> 01:25:37,424
No civilians behind the building!

860
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:43,230
- He's coming out!
- I don't have a visual!

861
01:25:43,722 --> 01:25:45,190
Come closer, keep walking!

862
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:47,396
Keep walking!

863
01:25:47,476 --> 01:25:49,524
- Get on your knees!
- Get on your knees!

864
01:25:49,603 --> 01:25:52,026
Get on your knees! Get on your knees!

865
01:25:52,105 --> 01:25:53,197
On your knees, on your knees!

866
01:25:53,273 --> 01:25:54,365
Hands behind your head!

867
01:25:54,441 --> 01:25:56,660
- Let's go!
- Get on the ground, now!

868
01:25:56,735 --> 01:25:58,032
Don't move!

869
01:25:58,111 --> 01:25:59,488
Stay down! Eyes down!

870
01:25:59,571 --> 01:26:00,663
Stay down!

871
01:26:06,328 --> 01:26:07,921
- Get him up, get him up!
- He's clean.

872
01:26:47,035 --> 01:26:48,708
Team leaders, let's have them check in.

873
01:27:29,953 --> 01:27:31,125
Ms. Smith...

874
01:27:33,874 --> 01:27:36,252
I don't know what you went through in there, ma'am.

875
01:27:37,669 --> 01:27:39,546
But whatever you did,

876
01:27:40,464 --> 01:27:41,841
thank you.

877
01:28:00,776 --> 01:28:04,201
I'm sorry, ma'am, but you can't go in.

878
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:38,731
Mommy!

879
01:28:39,689 --> 01:28:40,736
Paige!

880
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:44,202
Ashley!

881
01:28:45,237 --> 01:28:46,830
I love you so much!

882
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:48,869
Darling, are you okay?

883
01:28:49,115 --> 01:28:50,412
I am now.

884
01:28:52,702 --> 01:28:53,874
You came.

885
01:28:54,496 --> 01:28:55,543
Of course we came.

886
01:28:59,251 --> 01:29:01,674
I'm sorry I wasn't there this morning.

887
01:29:02,003 --> 01:29:04,301
But from now on, I will be, okay?

888
01:29:05,924 --> 01:29:07,767
Just you and me.

889
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:09,428
I love you.

890
01:29:10,136 --> 01:29:11,262
I love you, too.

891
01:29:15,308 --> 01:29:16,651
Thank God.

892
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:15,668
I was very nervous. I was scared.

893
01:30:15,744 --> 01:30:17,667
What have you just done?

894
01:30:17,746 --> 01:30:21,467
You have just offered the thing that has ruined your life

895
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:23,964
and made you crazy to a killer.

896
01:30:24,419 --> 01:30:26,672
You're dead now.

897
01:30:29,674 --> 01:30:32,018
Yeah, when I read that, I thought, well...

898
01:30:33,178 --> 01:30:34,851
Jesus loves you, girl.

899
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:39,271
Jesus be looking at you.

900
01:30:39,351 --> 01:30:43,731
Because, to offer crystal meth to a killer is pretty...

901
01:30:43,813 --> 01:30:45,986
I thought, I would rather die

902
01:30:46,066 --> 01:30:48,444
in this apartment tonight, not doing those drugs.

903
01:30:48,526 --> 01:30:49,994
I don't care what happens to me

904
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:52,949
as long as I make it out of here alive to see my daughter.

905
01:30:53,156 --> 01:30:54,408
Were you at that point thinking,

906
01:30:54,491 --> 01:30:57,290
"I might be able to live. I think I can live"?

907
01:30:57,369 --> 01:30:59,963
I was trying to have some hope, yeah.

908
01:31:00,038 --> 01:31:02,211
He's here, and he wants to meet you in person.

909
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:03,291
No way.

910
01:31:03,375 --> 01:31:04,797
Please welcome the author of The Purpose Driven Life,

911
01:31:04,876 --> 01:31:06,219
Rick Warren.

912
01:31:16,388 --> 01:31:19,517
Oprah, there are two great stories in Ashley's life.

913
01:31:19,599 --> 01:31:20,851
One of them is,

914
01:31:20,934 --> 01:31:22,857
you don't have to be perfect to be used by God.

915
01:31:22,936 --> 01:31:23,937
Yeah.

916
01:31:24,938 --> 01:31:27,191
If God only used perfect people, nothing would get done,

917
01:31:27,273 --> 01:31:28,866
- because none of us are perfect.
- Right.

918
01:31:28,942 --> 01:31:32,412
I think the other thing is that no matter how bad your problems are,

919
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:34,034
God's purpose is bigger.

920
01:31:34,114 --> 01:31:37,744
I think it was Ashley's attitude from the whole book

921
01:31:37,826 --> 01:31:39,043
that actually made the difference,

922
01:31:39,119 --> 01:31:42,373
in that, everybody's looking for hope.

923
01:31:42,455 --> 01:31:43,456
Yeah.

924
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:44,917
The book's just a book about hope.

925
01:31:45,208 --> 01:31:47,461
Because when people are going through a crisis,

926
01:31:47,544 --> 01:31:48,716
they're looking for hope.

926
01:31:49,305 --> 01:31:55,668
