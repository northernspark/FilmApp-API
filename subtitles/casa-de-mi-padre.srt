3
00:04:00,022 --> 00:04:03,226
Armando! Why do you care so much
for one calf

4
00:04:03,226 --> 00:04:06,029
When the real money is on all the cows

5
00:04:06,296 --> 00:04:09,967
Esteban, one day,
The ranch of my father will go

6
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:13,170
to the possession of my brother and I.

7
00:04:13,204 --> 00:04:15,173
And we will need this calf.

8
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,409
And many, many others.

9
00:04:17,977 --> 00:04:23,183
I keep telling you, he cares more for
a calf than what he does for women.

10
00:04:24,084 --> 00:04:26,854
Yes, you're right, Manuel ...

11
00:04:26,955 --> 00:04:30,291
But only cause I have not met my ideal woman.

12
00:05:05,432 --> 00:05:10,973
I propose a race to the house!

13
00:05:14,343 --> 00:05:17,748
Hopefully on the way home
nothing bad will happen.

14
00:05:18,215 --> 00:05:20,617
And the fight will be fair!

15
00:05:28,694 --> 00:05:30,596
Hide!

16
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:41,543
I have a bad feeling!

17
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:45,714
He's a drug dealer!

18
00:05:45,848 --> 00:05:47,950
We must help this man.

19
00:05:48,016 --> 00:05:49,952
And get murdered too?

20
00:05:52,556 --> 00:05:55,625
Maybe he only
wants to know something?

21
00:05:58,563 --> 00:06:00,598
Blessed Virgin Mary!

22
00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:04,204
Praying will not help him.

23
00:06:05,971 --> 00:06:10,711
We have nothing more to do
but to pray for him.

24
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,455
What are we doing here?

25
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:22,725
Perhaps your brother already come home?

26
00:06:25,561 --> 00:06:29,366
Fuck yeah! Fuck yeah!
- Be quiet!

27
00:06:41,313 --> 00:06:43,115
Come in.

28
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:48,422
Father, do you have a minute for me?

29
00:06:48,456 --> 00:06:51,793
Well, what do you want?
- Excuse me, I did not want to bother, but ...

30
00:06:51,859 --> 00:06:53,661
Where have you been, Armando.?

31
00:06:53,728 --> 00:06:57,532
As you ordered, we directed
our cattle to new pasture.

32
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,203
And why so long? The house
and other work is incomplete, Armando.!

33
00:07:01,237 --> 00:07:05,074
Something wrong, Dad?
- Don't bother me.

34
00:07:06,377 --> 00:07:10,882
Armando!
- Yes, father?

35
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,518
Oh, come over here ...

36
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,725
I'm sorry ...

37
00:07:18,925 --> 00:07:22,696
I have being disturbed by many thing.

38
00:07:22,763 --> 00:07:24,899
Let ... I
I want to help you.

39
00:07:24,931 --> 00:07:26,933
., ., listen.

40
00:07:28,102 --> 00:07:31,173
You're so much like your  mother.

41
00:07:31,606 --> 00:07:35,611
She had a kind heart,
and you too are very kindly.

42
00:07:35,678 --> 00:07:38,280
But your mother was a silly,

43
00:07:38,314 --> 00:07:41,184
And you too are such a fool.

44
00:07:41,251 --> 00:07:44,922
But I got smart, Dad!
- Yes, l know,Armando.!

45
00:07:45,023 --> 00:07:49,227
But to help me, you have to be
Well, at least a little  more intelligent.

46
00:07:49,294 --> 00:07:54,334
And if you were smarter, you would know
that you ...Are a complete idiot.

47
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:57,304
Look ,such a hefty skull ...

48
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,974
Raul!
- Raul, your brother!

49
00:08:00,007 --> 00:08:02,710
Is Raul!

50
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:07,349
No, no, no ... Agree on everything
with the Japanese and give it to them ,later will discuss it.

51
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,218
See you later.
- Raul!

52
00:08:09,218 --> 00:08:11,120
Brother!

53
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,524
We're so close, brother!

54
00:08:15,524 --> 00:08:18,763
And that! We have experienced many thins together!

55
00:08:19,529 --> 00:08:22,900
Raul!
- Dad!

56
00:08:23,501 --> 00:08:27,906
Finally the most Intelligent of my sons come back

57
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:32,145
You are my Favorite son, which
I always love more.

58
00:08:39,587 --> 00:08:42,056
Oh, hell!
I almost forgot ...

59
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,059
Sweetheart!

60
00:08:46,796 --> 00:08:50,700
Allow me to introduce you
Senorita Sonia Lopez.

61
00:09:07,354 --> 00:09:10,557
Sonia Lopez!
- It is an honor to meet you!

62
00:09:10,658 --> 00:09:14,596
Very, very nice!
Let me look at you.

63
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:21,837
And you should be,Armando!
Armando Alvarez, Senorita Lopez.

64
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:24,340
Welcome to our home .

65
00:09:24,474 --> 00:09:28,311
Oh, thank you! Call me Sonia!
And I'll call you,Armando.

66
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,448
That would be nice, Sonia.

67
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:36,188
Hello! I am, Sonia.
I am Esteban de Los Santos Escobar Chavez.

68
00:09:44,564 --> 00:09:46,400
Señor!

69
00:09:47,368 --> 00:09:49,970
Thank you, Esmeralda.
you are Welcome.

70
00:09:50,104 --> 00:09:52,840
Señor!
- Thank you!

71
00:09:52,907 --> 00:09:54,809
Please!

72
00:09:57,446 --> 00:10:02,886
Thank you, darling!
- Raul, you brought much joy to our father.

73
00:10:02,953 --> 00:10:05,255
That's why I'm an Alvarez, right?

74
00:10:06,323 --> 00:10:09,961
Know if would get rid of drug dealers
from our ranch ...

75
00:10:09,994 --> 00:10:15,234
This morning I was with Manuel
Esteban and witnessed a murder.

76
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:18,004
And why did you not tell me?

77
00:10:18,071 --> 00:10:21,007
Father, I saw that you were very upset.

78
00:10:21,608 --> 00:10:23,410
They killed a man.

79
00:10:23,977 --> 00:10:26,246
I think it was the Lynx.

80
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,782
The Lynx.

81
00:10:29,351 --> 00:10:30,786
Senorita Lopez.

82
00:10:30,852 --> 00:10:31,754
Sonia ...

83
00:10:31,853 --> 00:10:33,255
How nice to see you.

84
00:10:33,321 --> 00:10:34,924
I am glad that you came to us,

85
00:10:34,991 --> 00:10:41,197
Here our very own Armando. Do not have
experience with the ladies.

86
00:10:41,331 --> 00:10:44,535
As if they do not like them at all!

87
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:48,105
Is that true, .?
You don't have interest in women?

88
00:10:48,172 --> 00:10:51,310
I would not say so, Senorita Lopez.

89
00:10:51,611 --> 00:10:54,680
I have not met
the woman of my dreams.

90
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:56,783
And what should it be?

91
00:11:03,223 --> 00:11:07,228
My woman, Senorita Lopez

92
00:11:07,496 --> 00:11:11,934
Would love this land
no less than I love her...

93
00:11:12,301 --> 00:11:15,471
More than all the gold of the world ...

94
00:11:15,572 --> 00:11:18,174
She would have to enjoy the

95
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:20,845
scent of a cactus flower.

96
00:11:21,545 --> 00:11:27,954
She would have to sleep under the stars,
and let the wild wind ...

97
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:33,493
caress her body
and shelter her soul.

98
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:37,631
Her joy will be my joys,

99
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:40,835
her dreams, my dreams ...

100
00:11:40,935 --> 00:11:42,370
and our love ...

101
00:11:42,471 --> 00:11:44,874
like a beautiful song ...

102
00:11:44,973 --> 00:11:47,543
and this song is pure truth!

103
00:11:56,487 --> 00:11:59,657
See, you're a hopeless romantic ...

104
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,662
What  woman would
agrees to sleep on the dirt?

105
00:12:03,696 --> 00:12:04,931
I beg ...

106
00:12:05,031 --> 00:12:07,901
Sonia! Come here!

107
00:12:13,308 --> 00:12:15,476
Sonia! Come here!

108
00:12:19,214 --> 00:12:22,050
Father, I ...

109
00:12:22,518 --> 00:12:24,987
that if, Senorita Lopez

110
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:27,023
Sonia and I

111
00:12:27,223 --> 00:12:32,063
We ask your blessing,
to marry.

112
00:12:32,396 --> 00:12:35,634
Ask for blessings? You get married?

113
00:12:35,701 --> 00:12:37,402
What a joy!

114
00:12:39,706 --> 00:12:44,944
The Lord blessed the house of Alvarez!

115
00:12:45,478 --> 00:12:50,251
Thank you! For Raul, and you, Sonia!

116
00:12:50,384 --> 00:12:52,386
Good luck! For you!

117
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,788
For you!

118
00:12:54,156 --> 00:12:55,390
For us!
- Thank you!

119
00:12:55,457 --> 00:12:57,092
For you!
- Thank you!

120
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,961
And for you, brother!

121
00:12:59,728 --> 00:13:00,830
For you!

122
00:13:14,212 --> 00:13:15,881
So is it true?

123
00:13:16,248 --> 00:13:19,252
It is written here that Raul
is marrying this girl.

124
00:13:19,653 --> 00:13:20,987
It is.

125
00:13:22,122 --> 00:13:26,060
She's the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

126
00:13:26,394 --> 00:13:28,396
Yes, she's very pretty.

127
00:13:29,965 --> 00:13:32,834
It looks like you're not very happy, ..

128
00:13:33,569 --> 00:13:35,838
Are you jealous of your brother?

129
00:13:36,705 --> 00:13:38,208
Jealous?

130
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,043
No, Manuel,

131
00:13:40,109 --> 00:13:43,848
I could never be jealous
of my own brother?

132
00:13:44,348 --> 00:13:49,054
Simply, I love him very much,
and I am worried for him.

133
00:13:49,087 --> 00:13:50,655
Worried?

134
00:13:51,323 --> 00:13:54,293
Don't know, he's changed.

135
00:13:54,794 --> 00:13:57,331
I think , you're just jealous!

136
00:13:57,765 --> 00:13:59,433
I am so jealous!

137
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:05,407
If I had a woman like that
She would never leave my bed!

138
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,430
can you tell me the joke?

139
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:33,606
No,I think not, Senorita Lopez.
Our joke was about you.

140
00:14:34,408 --> 00:14:36,076
Horseback ride?

141
00:14:36,177 --> 00:14:39,380
I have not sat in the saddle for long
but I'll be happy to try !

142
00:14:39,413 --> 00:14:41,082
Esteban! Manuel!

143
00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:44,620
Check on the herd. And I'll meet you later.

144
00:14:44,653 --> 00:14:45,789
Alright.

145
00:15:11,385 --> 00:15:12,919
Alright.

146
00:15:17,592 --> 00:15:20,796
You are a good rider, Senorita Lopez.

147
00:15:20,996 --> 00:15:24,133
Skillfully operate, excellent posture.

148
00:15:24,266 --> 00:15:28,439
This is a naughty stud ...
obviously this was not your first.

149
00:15:28,504 --> 00:15:31,675
I learned to ride before walking.

150
00:15:31,775 --> 00:15:33,110
I see.

151
00:15:33,378 --> 00:15:36,915
I was nine years old,
When my father was killed.

152
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,885
And I was sent to the city, to live with my uncle.

153
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:42,956
Interesting...
- My uncle was a wicked, bad man.

154
00:15:43,022 --> 00:15:44,858
He drank industrial alcohol.

155
00:15:45,392 --> 00:15:48,162
He beat me and put out cigarettes on me

156
00:15:48,262 --> 00:15:49,430
Interesting.

157
00:15:49,497 --> 00:15:52,434
At age 12 I ran away.

158
00:15:54,469 --> 00:15:57,906
But he found me, beat me
and said that he would marry me.

159
00:15:57,939 --> 00:15:59,608
Interesting.

160
00:16:00,677 --> 00:16:02,412
And your uncle?

161
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,248
I have not seen him in long time.

162
00:16:06,016 --> 00:16:10,989
I need you to ask about something.
Do you love Raul?

163
00:16:13,592 --> 00:16:17,731
Raul is very good to me,
and I  to him.

164
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:22,670
Do you love him?
I have to know this.

165
00:16:25,406 --> 00:16:29,377
I propose  a race! to show you
what kind of rider I am!

166
00:16:30,145 --> 00:16:31,914
Well, we'll see!

167
00:16:59,246 --> 00:17:01,248
How beautiful!

168
00:17:01,716 --> 00:17:03,385
What is this place?

169
00:17:04,253 --> 00:17:05,820
It ...

170
00:17:06,087 --> 00:17:07,590
is called ...

171
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:10,092
Seven tears lake .

172
00:17:11,494 --> 00:17:15,866
I come here to swin when I was a boy

173
00:17:16,366 --> 00:17:20,738
This is the most beautiful place
I have ever seen!

174
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:25,043
How did you know,how to get here?

175
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,446
Wind told me to ...

176
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,716
Sometimes he talks to me ...

177
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:35,856
This is where my mother was killed.

178
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:39,327
It was her favorite place.

179
00:17:45,433 --> 00:17:46,869
I have a lot of work.

180
00:17:46,936 --> 00:17:49,205
Go, my hair is still wet.

181
00:17:49,272 --> 00:17:52,644
don't take too long.
this region is full of bandits.

182
00:17:52,742 --> 00:17:54,178
Armando will  protect me.

183
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:56,646
And it's true!

184
00:17:59,985 --> 00:18:03,456
My son,this is my father's rifle.

185
00:18:03,556 --> 00:18:06,659
He handed it to me,
When I was a kid

186
00:18:06,726 --> 00:18:09,062
now I give it to you.

187
00:18:12,532 --> 00:18:15,202
Go! You must build our house.

188
00:18:24,247 --> 00:18:25,782
Armando!

189
00:18:26,482 --> 00:18:27,951
What do you want?

190
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:29,687
Armando, give me the rifle!

191
00:18:29,787 --> 00:18:32,757
Boy, give me the rifle!

192
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:37,296
No! Do not touch me! No!
Let me go! No! No!

193
00:18:37,362 --> 00:18:41,700
No! Scum! Don't dare to touch me

194
00:18:41,801 --> 00:18:44,337
Armando save me!

195
00:18:54,516 --> 00:18:57,787
And she loved to come here.

196
00:18:59,188 --> 00:19:00,656
I am sorry.

197
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,659
Long since it happened.

198
00:19:03,493 --> 00:19:06,898
Perhaps I could
stay here forever.

199
00:19:07,531 --> 00:19:10,134
That,I doubt it.

200
00:19:10,703 --> 00:19:12,504
Why is that?

201
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,676
Here, there is nothing to buy!

202
00:19:16,742 --> 00:19:18,178
No shops,

203
00:19:18,278 --> 00:19:22,482
or expensive clothes,
or designer shoes.

204
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,653
This is not Dallas!

205
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,589
Such opinions you have about me, huh?

206
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,062
is not important what I think about you?

207
00:19:33,196 --> 00:19:34,396
I have nobody else.

208
00:19:34,463 --> 00:19:35,865
You think I'm cheap,

209
00:19:35,932 --> 00:19:38,668
who's only after Raul's money?

210
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,404
Is it not so?

211
00:19:45,677 --> 00:19:48,947
You have not answered my question ...

212
00:19:49,014 --> 00:19:50,316
What question?

213
00:19:50,349 --> 00:19:52,985
Do you love my brother Raul?

214
00:19:53,085 --> 00:19:54,787
Take me  back to the house,Right now

215
00:19:54,821 --> 00:19:57,157
First answer the question!

216
00:19:57,357 --> 00:19:59,426
Bongo? Kong?

217
00:19:59,459 --> 00:20:01,195
Shots!
- Where?

218
00:20:01,262 --> 00:20:02,463
Over the hill.

219
00:20:02,564 --> 00:20:05,567
Hunters?
- No, not hunters.

220
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:09,906
What if someone is in trouble?
- It's not our business.

221
00:20:10,106 --> 00:20:13,009
You're a coward,
A coward!

222
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:38,072
Forgive me, Lord!
And accept my soul!

223
00:20:38,172 --> 00:20:39,741
No, no, calm ...

224
00:20:39,808 --> 00:20:41,375
We'll take you to the hospital!

225
00:20:41,442 --> 00:20:45,147
Let him die pacefully .
He is missing an arm.

226
00:20:45,748 --> 00:20:47,818
Give me water, .!

227
00:20:48,016 --> 00:20:49,753
Spend the water on it?

228
00:20:50,286 --> 00:20:56,260
There's a trunk! They are in the trunk!
Collect them!

229
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:01,133
Here, drink. This is the water.

230
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:03,902
Drink. Silence.

231
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:08,909
I know you. You ... Are you Sonia.

232
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:12,112
Thought so - the trunk is full of drugs.
Armando.

233
00:21:12,112 --> 00:21:15,083
better to help me
put him on a horse!

234
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,320
He comes ...

235
00:21:18,353 --> 00:21:20,189
The Lynx!

236
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:27,298
Maybe God will have mercy on me
and I will die sooner!

237
00:21:28,699 --> 00:21:30,667
He's dead!

238
00:21:31,569 --> 00:21:34,005
He was dead long before.

239
00:21:35,373 --> 00:21:42,015
It looks like it is now yours.
You are now a bride with a dowry.

240
00:21:45,018 --> 00:21:47,088
You do not want them?

241
00:21:47,254 --> 00:21:50,558
Perhaps like a wedding gift
From an old friend?

242
00:21:51,459 --> 00:21:53,662
Just before he die

243
00:21:56,498 --> 00:21:58,767
I am tired of this ...

244
00:21:58,968 --> 00:22:01,171
You don't love my brother.

245
00:22:05,776 --> 00:22:08,246
Let me go! You're hurting me!

246
00:22:08,345 --> 00:22:14,453
I thik that I know
what kind of woman you are.

247
00:22:14,486 --> 00:22:16,790
You do not know nothing about me.

248
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:22,396
I  know that you won't be  Raul's wife,
while I'm alive.

249
00:22:23,464 --> 00:22:26,667
And  you think
Raul so innocent.

250
00:22:26,835 --> 00:22:28,404
Lies!

251
00:22:31,573 --> 00:22:33,275
You silly shepherd!

252
00:22:33,342 --> 00:22:36,412
Your brother is a drug dealer!

253
00:22:37,113 --> 00:22:39,550
You did this!

254
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,719
And so help me God,

255
00:22:41,785 --> 00:22:48,627
If this is true, and my brother
is a drug dealer,

256
00:22:48,693 --> 00:22:52,064
You will never bear the name of Alvarez!

257
00:22:52,331 --> 00:22:54,834
I take care of my family!

258
00:22:54,901 --> 00:22:59,106
And the Devil take care of you.

259
00:23:11,554 --> 00:23:16,761
Are you sure that Raul
is indeed selling drugs?

260
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:18,629
I do not know, Manuel ...

261
00:23:18,696 --> 00:23:22,767
But I feel that something was wrong with him.
Since he's returned.

262
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:25,203
And this morning with Sonia?

263
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:29,141
Or maybe she's lying ?
All sluts lie.

264
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:32,646
You are right, sluts Always lie.

265
00:23:32,646 --> 00:23:36,150
But Senorita Lopez
She's not a slut.

266
00:23:37,785 --> 00:23:39,754
I love sluts.

267
00:23:59,244 --> 00:24:02,715
You two wait here while I speak with Raul.

268
00:24:19,201 --> 00:24:21,103
It is true?

269
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,738
What do you mean?

270
00:24:23,673 --> 00:24:26,343
That you are a drug lord.

271
00:24:28,078 --> 00:24:31,216
I have my business in Mexico City
what is the difference to you?

272
00:24:33,051 --> 00:24:36,121
You have disgraced our family.

273
00:24:36,155 --> 00:24:37,723
No, ., no.

274
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:41,193
I'm here to save our family.
Feel the difference?

275
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,765
You are dragging our family
to the very bottom of hell!

276
00:24:51,339 --> 00:24:52,975
Listen ...

277
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:55,410
Yes.

278
00:24:55,444 --> 00:24:59,148
I move drugs across the border.

279
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:01,084
I do sale them drugs .

280
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:03,386
To the gringos!

281
00:25:03,487 --> 00:25:04,922
I don't sale it to our people.

282
00:25:06,023 --> 00:25:08,993
To Americans,and I would be glad to sale them
chocolates,if that is what they want, but no!

283
00:25:08,993 --> 00:25:10,529
They want drugs.

284
00:25:11,262 --> 00:25:14,333
This is not the America
that our father worshiped?

285
00:25:14,366 --> 00:25:18,338
This is a country of greedy children ...

286
00:25:18,739 --> 00:25:21,308
They buy houses,without money.

287
00:25:21,341 --> 00:25:27,115
TVs and cars without any money.

288
00:25:27,182 --> 00:25:29,818
And shoved in their mouths,like monsters ...

289
00:25:29,851 --> 00:25:33,220
These fatty shit-burgers ...

290
00:25:34,224 --> 00:25:37,527
it's irresponsible to feed sweet to children

291
00:25:37,628 --> 00:25:39,095
They are not children, ..

292
00:25:39,129 --> 00:25:40,230
No ...

293
00:25:40,297 --> 00:25:43,601
they are all adult and crazy.

294
00:25:44,536 --> 00:25:47,338
Well they really cry like babies.

295
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:50,142
"Aw, Look at the Mexicans!

296
00:25:50,209 --> 00:25:52,912
They gonna fuck us up and  killed
with their drugs! "

297
00:25:52,945 --> 00:25:54,848
Fuck them all!

298
00:25:55,348 --> 00:25:57,650
And fuck all those
children addicted to drugs!

299
00:25:57,751 --> 00:25:59,187
Fuck them!

300
00:25:59,253 --> 00:26:01,655
Fuck all those women that shove up heroin

301
00:26:01,722 --> 00:26:04,892
And snort coke without stopping!

302
00:26:05,026 --> 00:26:08,563
Fuck those potheads Doctors from California

303
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:10,533
What do I have to feel sorry for them?

304
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:13,469
If they want to snort shit

305
00:26:13,536 --> 00:26:15,706
Somebody have to sell it to them, Armanito!

306
00:26:15,738 --> 00:26:18,075
Yes, is not easy ...

307
00:26:18,142 --> 00:26:21,980
But  we are infected with their greed!

308
00:26:22,046 --> 00:26:24,316
We are going to end up
killing each other,

309
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:27,887
So we can feed  those chewing shit-burgers.

310
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,622
Crazy kids

311
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:30,924
Hey, .:

312
00:26:31,224 --> 00:26:38,099
This country will become stronger, thanks to
the addiction of the Americans .

313
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:40,502
Oh, I know what I'm saying.

314
00:26:47,644 --> 00:26:49,245
Whats Up?

315
00:26:51,081 --> 00:26:52,750
Are you Raul?

316
00:26:54,018 --> 00:26:56,753
You know perfectly well who I am.

317
00:26:57,555 --> 00:27:01,360
And I know very well who you are

318
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:04,797
The Lynx.

319
00:27:05,431 --> 00:27:07,033
The Lynx.

320
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,236
Yes, the Lynx ...

321
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:16,010
Well, Raul, and what hell are you doing around?

322
00:27:17,446 --> 00:27:19,848
Came to visit relatives...

323
00:27:20,282 --> 00:27:22,419
I'm here

324
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:25,288
because ...

325
00:27:27,991 --> 00:27:30,095
this is my land.

326
00:27:36,435 --> 00:27:39,572
You fool,always playing around?

327
00:27:39,805 --> 00:27:41,841
Such a joker your Brother .

328
00:27:41,941 --> 00:27:43,844
But look Raul ...

329
00:27:44,044 --> 00:27:45,779
I don't believe it!

330
00:27:49,283 --> 00:27:51,419
You already took my woman

331
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,090
And I think you want something else.

332
00:27:55,391 --> 00:27:57,693
This woman was never yours.

333
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,830
No? ...
No.

334
00:27:59,897 --> 00:28:02,632
And I repeat ... I'm here

335
00:28:04,668 --> 00:28:06,537
because ...

336
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,842
this is my land.

337
00:28:17,951 --> 00:28:20,487
. ...
- Yes?

338
00:28:21,889 --> 00:28:24,191
Can I call you Armandito?

339
00:28:24,758 --> 00:28:26,594
I like it.

340
00:28:27,862 --> 00:28:29,998
You know, what your brother does?

341
00:28:31,834 --> 00:28:33,702
Know what he does for a living?

342
00:28:37,774 --> 00:28:43,314
Is very dangerous for you.
And for him too.

343
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:47,986
It is dangerous for your entire family.

344
00:28:51,691 --> 00:28:53,926
Hey, chill, chill, chill.

345
00:28:54,027 --> 00:28:55,429
not all herdsman

346
00:28:55,495 --> 00:28:57,698
Like Canadian slim menthol.

347
00:28:57,731 --> 00:29:00,935
No, no, I like them slim.

348
00:29:02,371 --> 00:29:03,705
Well, so what ...

349
00:29:03,771 --> 00:29:05,173
Just come to give this to you ...

350
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,775
I think belongs you.

351
00:29:07,408 --> 00:29:08,777
Thank you!

352
00:29:08,978 --> 00:29:10,480
You are welcome...

353
00:29:12,582 --> 00:29:14,351
Oh, Raul ...

354
00:29:15,218 --> 00:29:17,255
This will get ugly.

355
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,757
alright.

356
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,493
Adios!

357
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:25,431
Have a nice day!

358
00:29:25,898 --> 00:29:27,500
Chao!

359
00:29:29,302 --> 00:29:30,670
Bye bye!

360
00:29:30,703 --> 00:29:32,539
Bye, bye!

361
00:29:36,377 --> 00:29:37,779
Good luck!

362
00:29:57,668 --> 00:30:02,375
It appears that your Lynx
Doesn't want to follow your plan.

363
00:30:05,078 --> 00:30:08,915
., go home.

364
00:30:10,984 --> 00:30:15,323
Mexico,is no place for cowards.

365
00:30:21,364 --> 00:30:25,002
I live my life on this land ...

366
00:30:25,835 --> 00:30:28,873
And this land is all  I know.

367
00:30:29,273 --> 00:30:32,044
I'm just a cowboy,

368
00:30:32,244 --> 00:30:35,281
And that's all i know.

369
00:30:36,115 --> 00:30:40,086
I do not know.

370
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:50,598
Why does not the moon shines by day and night?

371
00:30:50,665 --> 00:30:52,333
I do not know!

372
00:30:52,367 --> 00:30:54,970
Why the bird flutters in the sky?

373
00:30:55,037 --> 00:30:57,039
I do not know!

374
00:30:57,206 --> 00:31:00,110
Why so the turtle is slow ?

375
00:31:00,143 --> 00:31:02,480
I do not know!

376
00:31:05,116 --> 00:31:06,650
That's the way!

377
00:31:06,784 --> 00:31:08,853
Why do not people love each other?

378
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,689
I do not know!

379
00:31:10,822 --> 00:31:13,192
Why is brother against brother?

380
00:31:13,326 --> 00:31:15,361
I do not know!

381
00:31:15,561 --> 00:31:18,832
Why is a flower
red, and the other blue?

382
00:31:18,865 --> 00:31:20,935
I do not know!

383
00:31:22,068 --> 00:31:26,040
How should I know anything?

384
00:31:26,441 --> 00:31:28,477
Where from? Where from?

385
00:31:28,611 --> 00:31:29,895
And why would I want with it?

386
00:31:30,053 --> 00:31:31,613
Viva Mexico!

387
00:31:33,615 --> 00:31:36,086
I am a man of this land

388
00:31:36,486 --> 00:31:38,789
I am a rancher.

389
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:43,161
And I do not know!

390
00:31:43,694 --> 00:31:46,098
I lead a simple life,

391
00:31:46,164 --> 00:31:47,966
I am the cow's friend!
Don't know how to kiss

392
00:31:47,999 --> 00:31:50,603
After all, I'm just a cowboy!

393
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:14,965
I do not know!

394
00:32:17,434 --> 00:32:19,370
I do not know!

395
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:25,277
Why girls are warm?

396
00:32:25,411 --> 00:32:27,847
And my bed so cold?

397
00:32:28,048 --> 00:32:29,983
I have only questions,

398
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,386
But I do not know the answers!

399
00:32:32,419 --> 00:32:34,154
After only a cowboy I

400
00:32:34,221 --> 00:32:36,891
And I do not know!

401
00:32:38,727 --> 00:32:43,065
The only thing I am sure of...

402
00:32:43,132 --> 00:32:46,102
Only the love!

403
00:33:20,909 --> 00:33:22,379
Look!

404
00:33:25,515 --> 00:33:27,117
It's a Lynx!

405
00:33:27,184 --> 00:33:28,819
A white cat!

406
00:33:29,153 --> 00:33:31,055
This is estrange ...

407
00:33:32,156 --> 00:33:33,358
Let me kill it!

408
00:33:33,424 --> 00:33:37,597
No. You can not kill such a beauty.

409
00:33:38,097 --> 00:33:40,867
He came to us for a reason.

410
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,070
Yeah, so I shot him.

411
00:33:44,104 --> 00:33:46,240
I do not know the reasons

412
00:33:46,573 --> 00:33:48,275
But I think,

413
00:33:48,342 --> 00:33:51,045
Has something to do with me.

414
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,169
Look at this country.

415
00:34:12,104 --> 00:34:14,507
So beautiful.

416
00:34:15,441 --> 00:34:18,010
So much pain?

417
00:34:18,912 --> 00:34:22,082
He slept like a log last night.

418
00:34:22,817 --> 00:34:25,787
I slept on a bottle of tequila .

419
00:34:31,259 --> 00:34:32,928
What is this?

420
00:34:33,195 --> 00:34:34,464
I do not know.

421
00:34:40,037 --> 00:34:42,307
I have a bad feeling ...

422
00:34:42,506 --> 00:34:44,409
You two do not get out.

423
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:47,913
Be careful.

424
00:34:57,491 --> 00:34:59,494
. Alvarez?

425
00:35:00,128 --> 00:35:02,163
Yes. That is my Name

426
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:04,399
I'm Vincent Blankardo.

427
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:07,804
Once I was your father's friend.

428
00:35:07,871 --> 00:35:10,239
You found the body of my mother.

429
00:35:10,272 --> 00:35:13,242
It's true ...
Too many years ago ...

430
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:17,114
., this gentlemans are from U.S.A ...

431
00:35:17,214 --> 00:35:19,351
D.E.A

432
00:35:19,418 --> 00:35:20,652
All right.

433
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:22,521
And how can I help them?

434
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,304
No, sir,
I do not speak American.

435
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:41,544
., I need your help.

436
00:35:41,577 --> 00:35:42,912
Of course

437
00:35:42,978 --> 00:35:47,617
We know that your brother
transports drugs across the border ...

438
00:35:47,684 --> 00:35:53,557
We know that he came here,
to reclaim the area ...

439
00:35:53,624 --> 00:35:55,693
From the Lynx.

440
00:35:57,395 --> 00:36:00,232
I don't think I can help you, sir?

441
00:36:00,299 --> 00:36:01,566
Parker.

442
00:36:01,667 --> 00:36:03,603
My name is Parker ...

443
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:08,375
And I think that you
can  help me.

444
00:36:18,254 --> 00:36:21,023
Listen,piece if shit

445
00:36:21,123 --> 00:36:23,192
I make only one call,

446
00:36:23,226 --> 00:36:25,229
And ten Helicopters will hoover...

447
00:36:25,262 --> 00:36:27,231
Over that hill ...

448
00:36:27,297 --> 00:36:29,734
and turn your ranch

449
00:36:29,767 --> 00:36:32,303
Into a fired fart

450
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:35,273
So think carefully.

451
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:52,261
It is better this way, ..
Talk to Raul.

452
00:36:52,328 --> 00:36:57,600
Find out everything for this Señor.
Now go find out.

453
00:37:32,909 --> 00:37:34,944
Ladies and Gentlemen!

454

I want to thank  everyone of you
For honored me with their presence.

455
00:37:39,383 --> 00:37:43,688
Tomorrow will be a
significant  day for the family Alvarez,

456
00:37:43,755 --> 00:37:46,758
I'll be happy to share this
with all of you.

457
00:37:46,792 --> 00:37:50,396
My sister, Carmen,

458
00:37:50,463 --> 00:37:54,067

460

And of course, Sheila from Atlanta
also arrived! Sheila!

461
00:38:10,153 --> 00:38:12,689
Tomorrow we'll have a double celebration!

462
00:38:12,789 --> 00:38:17,428
First, my beloved son, Raul
returned to the fold.

463
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:21,567
Second, he brought with him
This delightful woman,

464
00:38:21,567 --> 00:38:23,636
Which he enjoys making love!

465
00:38:23,669 --> 00:38:27,206
I raise my glass to Sonia, friends!

466
00:38:27,473 --> 00:38:30,210
For Sonia! Cheers!

467
00:38:31,411 --> 00:38:33,013
I also have something to say.

468
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:37,218
I thank you all for coming here from so far,Some ...

469
00:38:37,284 --> 00:38:41,356
But I want to thank especially

470
00:38:41,389 --> 00:38:46,930
to whom many of you often
called a fool, and slow-witted.

471
00:38:46,996 --> 00:38:49,532
And he is a man with a big heart.

472
00:38:50,067 --> 00:38:56,874
My toast is for my brother
.. For your happiness.

473
00:39:03,749 --> 00:39:05,018
Come on, .!

474
00:39:05,084 --> 00:39:08,522
You did not say back
a toast to his brother Raul?

475
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,562
Yes

476
00:39:14,863 --> 00:39:17,867
I drink to the happiness of Raul.

477
00:39:18,333 --> 00:39:22,472
I want you to enjoy the pleasures of earthly life ...

478
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:25,942
Even if it leads to the death of our family!

479
00:39:26,176 --> 00:39:28,179
What are you talking about!

480
00:39:33,918 --> 00:39:35,587
Calm down!

481
00:39:35,821 --> 00:39:38,091
It pains me to say this,

482
00:39:38,157 --> 00:39:41,227
but I do not want to see you
at the wedding of your brother!

483
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:44,097
Do you understand?
Get out of my house!

484
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,703
As you say, father.

485
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,704
Let him go!

486
00:39:53,943 --> 00:39:55,312
Where are you going? Sit down.

487
00:39:55,377 --> 00:39:57,213
You stay here with the guest

488
00:40:03,987 --> 00:40:07,258
Go back inside,
Get back with your people.

489
00:40:07,291 --> 00:40:09,695
Let's not create problems!

490
00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:12,698
You think I like
What Raul is doing?

491
00:40:12,765 --> 00:40:15,034
It's your business too.

492
00:40:15,301 --> 00:40:18,672
We can change it
but i need your help!

493
00:40:18,872 --> 00:40:22,509
You must know something.

494
00:40:24,546 --> 00:40:27,015
What should I know?

495
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:29,050
He ...

496
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:31,354
That who is called the Lynx ...

497
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,389
That is my uncle.

498
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,060
I understand.

499
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,831
Won't stop till he get what he wants

500
00:40:41,766 --> 00:40:45,303
You ran away from his problems,
but it brought them along.

501
00:40:47,072 --> 00:40:52,979
Then, save us,Save your brother.
Save your family,Save me.

502
00:40:55,214 --> 00:40:58,952
There are things
from which there is no salvation.

503
00:43:39,309 --> 00:43:41,412
Father! Father!

504
00:43:41,513 --> 00:43:45,384
Raul, who did it?
It was .?

505
00:43:45,451 --> 00:43:46,819
Quiet, quiet, Dad ...

506
00:43:46,851 --> 00:43:48,186
Do not say anything ...

507
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:49,589
Just do not die!

508
00:43:49,723 --> 00:43:51,156
Do not die, Dad!

509
00:43:51,223 --> 00:43:52,426
Hold on!

510
00:43:52,459 --> 00:43:54,494
Armando was right.

511
00:43:56,864 --> 00:43:59,600
Why should we stepped
on the threshold of this house?

512
00:43:59,667 --> 00:44:04,072
Hold on, Dad! Hold on!
That's it! Everything will be fine!

513
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:11,148
Help!

514
00:44:42,118 --> 00:44:43,619
Hello, Blankardo?

515
00:44:43,819 --> 00:44:45,188
It's done.

516
00:44:45,755 --> 00:44:47,257
And Sonia?

517
00:44:47,824 --> 00:44:50,928
Sonia is still alive, as you requested.

518
00:44:50,995 --> 00:44:52,196
All right.

519
00:44:52,263 --> 00:44:53,697
And Raul?

520
00:44:54,966 --> 00:44:57,301
Raul is still alive.

521
00:44:57,402 --> 00:44:59,138
So, wait, wait, wait.

522
00:44:59,205 --> 00:45:01,940
I pay you,so you will protect me

523
00:45:02,041 --> 00:45:03,777
You are a police, That i pay!

524
00:45:03,877 --> 00:45:06,713
Why are you not honest with me?
Why?

525
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,918
Do not worry,He will come to you.

526
00:45:12,286 --> 00:45:15,090
We must figure out how to lure him.

527
00:45:17,192 --> 00:45:19,429
His woman

528
00:45:19,662 --> 00:45:21,163
Woman?

529
00:45:21,631 --> 00:45:23,199
Sonia?

530
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,202
Sonia ...

531
00:45:25,302 --> 00:45:27,371
My Little niece ...

532
00:45:28,272 --> 00:45:29,874
Excellent, thank you!

533
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:45,026
Stop!

534
00:45:45,126 --> 00:45:46,861
Esteban, my friend, what happened?

535
00:45:46,894 --> 00:45:49,097
Your father got shot!
What?

536
00:45:49,164 --> 00:45:51,133
At the wedding! Shot by assassins!

537
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:53,368
And Raul?
- Raul and the woman are ok.

538
00:45:53,402 --> 00:45:56,838
But your father, you Father
He's dying!

539
00:45:57,206 --> 00:45:59,777
Let's go! Hurry up!

540
00:46:13,726 --> 00:46:16,563
Armand, come here.

541
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:18,532
Yes, father!

542
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:19,933
This is me!

543
00:46:22,336 --> 00:46:24,573
Do you remember your mother?

544
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:31,246
Yes. I remember, but a little bit.
She was a very beautiful woman.

545
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,784
She was very beautiful.

546
00:46:35,285 --> 00:46:37,988
The most beautiful in all of Mexico.

547
00:46:38,255 --> 00:46:40,692
You got her eyes ...

548
00:46:41,459 --> 00:46:44,496
Yes you told me many times ...

549
00:46:44,663 --> 00:46:48,967
I had the eyes of a chick

550
00:46:49,034 --> 00:46:50,770
Chick

551
00:46:52,706 --> 00:46:54,394
I have not been kind to you.

552
00:46:56,546 --> 00:47:00,138
I used to compared  you with

553
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:03,219
donkey and pigs.

554
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:07,689
Made fun of the way you speak.

555
00:47:08,424 --> 00:47:14,298
Gave you to the circus a couple of times.

556
00:47:14,365 --> 00:47:16,266
Please forgive me

557
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,269
I guess ...

558
00:47:18,736 --> 00:47:20,773
I never forgive ...

559
00:47:20,905 --> 00:47:24,110
you for the accident.

560
00:47:24,444 --> 00:47:27,013
And now I'm very sorry about this.

561
00:47:27,981 --> 00:47:29,816
I was hoping ...

562
00:47:30,216 --> 00:47:35,389
that when I see
your mother in heaven;

563
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:42,231
I would say that her house
and her family is in order.

564
00:47:44,734 --> 00:47:48,305
And what do I tell her now?

565
00:47:50,073 --> 00:47:54,446
Father, you have to lie to her.

566
00:47:54,979 --> 00:48:00,018
Tell her that Raul
married to a beautiful woman

567
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:03,990
and they have many children,

568
00:48:04,023 --> 00:48:10,665
And the Alvarez family
is known throughout Mexico

569
00:48:11,131 --> 00:48:14,936
for his generosity and honesty.

570
00:48:16,471 --> 00:48:19,074
I'll lie to her...

571
00:48:21,979 --> 00:48:28,352
Because I am ashamed
for the truth, ..

572
00:48:31,523 --> 00:48:33,892
I'm so ashamed.

573
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:45,673
Dad ...

574
00:48:48,275 --> 00:48:49,944
Dad ...

575
00:48:56,752 --> 00:48:59,422
I'll kill the motherfucker that did this!

576
00:48:59,789 --> 00:49:02,493
He was not killed by a man

577
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:04,929
He die of shame.

578
00:49:07,431 --> 00:49:08,733
Sonia ...

579
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,236
Took his horse and left.

580
00:49:12,037 --> 00:49:16,075
Take Esteban and find it, ..

581
00:49:16,342 --> 00:49:18,010
Please

582
00:49:18,244 --> 00:49:20,882
I'll help you find your woman.

583
00:49:21,549 --> 00:49:23,852
But after we  Find her, alive or dead,

584
00:49:23,918 --> 00:49:28,157
You will not see me again. Ever.

585
00:50:49,821 --> 00:50:54,460
You hope that the water
wash away your shame?

586
00:50:56,561 --> 00:50:59,031
Leave me alone.

587
00:50:59,164 --> 00:51:02,301
I forbid you to swim here!

588
00:51:02,668 --> 00:51:05,906
This is a holy place for me!

589
00:51:07,407 --> 00:51:09,010
Swim?

590
00:51:09,043 --> 00:51:10,511
No ...

591
00:51:10,611 --> 00:51:12,581
I don't know swiming.

592
00:51:13,848 --> 00:51:17,185
None ever taught me to swim.

593
00:51:55,397 --> 00:51:57,801
Please!
I do not want to live!

594
00:51:58,734 --> 00:52:00,471
You kill yourself?

595
00:52:00,704 --> 00:52:02,372
you are an Imbecil!

596
00:52:04,475 --> 00:52:06,110
How to live on?

597
00:52:06,244 --> 00:52:08,680
You do not understand
I do not have salvation!

598
00:52:08,814 --> 00:52:11,184
But you knew,

599
00:52:11,417 --> 00:52:13,018
what you were getting into

600
00:52:13,152 --> 00:52:16,289
When you come with Raul here.

601
00:52:16,356 --> 00:52:17,857
Yes ...

602
00:52:17,991 --> 00:52:19,994
Of course, I knew.

603
00:52:20,128 --> 00:52:22,229
But he said that he will change ...

604
00:52:22,296 --> 00:52:26,635
That he wanted to star a new life in the ranch
Tha everything will be diferent

605
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:29,605
And you, believed him?

606
00:52:29,672 --> 00:52:30,806
Yes!

607
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:33,209
No ...
I do not know ...

608
00:52:33,243 --> 00:52:34,845
I do not know ...

609
00:52:35,045 --> 00:52:37,047
Please .,

610
00:52:38,316 --> 00:52:41,319
let me die, Raul, do not need me.

611
00:52:43,721 --> 00:52:46,325
I came not for Raul.

612
00:52:46,492 --> 00:52:48,594
Came for you

613
00:52:50,629 --> 00:52:52,833
I not good...

614
00:52:53,567 --> 00:52:56,370
I am worse!

615
00:54:44,765 --> 00:54:49,137
Look at them.
Such pacified.

616
00:54:54,009 --> 00:54:55,378
Wait a minute!

617
00:54:56,146 --> 00:55:00,552
I thought you said
Raul's woman?

618
00:55:00,851 --> 00:55:02,619
You said that she was Raul's woman.

619
00:55:02,686 --> 00:55:04,789
She is the woman of Raul.

620
00:55:04,822 --> 00:55:08,160
Why are you sleeping
with this dirty hairy shepherd?

621
00:55:08,192 --> 00:55:09,762
I beg you,uncle ...

622
00:55:09,828 --> 00:55:12,031
Well as long as you are happy ...

623
00:55:12,064 --> 00:55:14,434
Cause raul don't have dick

624
00:55:16,636 --> 00:55:19,740
I even began to
like the joke about the dick.

625
00:55:21,275 --> 00:55:23,177
What do you want from us?

626
00:55:23,344 --> 00:55:25,514
This is the land of my father.

627
00:55:26,282 --> 00:55:28,317
You are trespassing.

628
00:55:28,817 --> 00:55:30,586
No, I would not say so.

629
00:55:30,752 --> 00:55:32,355
It would be better saying,

630
00:55:32,455 --> 00:55:35,926
That you just trespass your  brother's wife!

631
00:55:37,562 --> 00:55:38,628
Good joke, right?

632
00:55:38,695 --> 00:55:40,698
Leave us alone.

633
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:46,605
Grab her

634
00:55:46,672 --> 00:55:48,641
Let's see whether  Raul still interested on her.

635
00:55:52,178 --> 00:55:53,781
Defend yourself

636
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:56,183
Or I will break you
apart with their bare hands.

637
00:55:56,284 --> 00:55:59,821
I did not come to fight ...

638
00:56:00,355 --> 00:56:01,589
Kill him

639
00:56:02,591 --> 00:56:05,194
As symbolic that
You die at the same place,

640
00:56:05,261 --> 00:56:06,696
where is your mother ...

641
00:56:06,762 --> 00:56:09,666
If you would have let me rape her

642
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:12,469
She would not have died that day.

643
00:56:15,405 --> 00:56:16,640
You!

644
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:19,711
kiss her for me, ..

645
00:56:24,316 --> 00:56:25,985
Oh, you coward!

646
00:56:26,052 --> 00:56:27,487
Wait,the gun is still  hot!

647
00:56:27,521 --> 00:56:29,457
Shut up, motherfucker!

648
00:56:34,429 --> 00:56:36,164
Let the coyotes devour him

649
00:56:37,532 --> 00:56:41,336
And we need to reserve a couple of
bullets for her brother, right?

650
00:56:41,403 --> 00:56:43,006
You never know

651
00:56:53,117 --> 00:56:54,819
That went well...

652
00:57:04,164 --> 00:57:06,333
You underestimate Raul.

653
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,704
No,no,no,
but he made a huge mistake,

654
00:57:09,771 --> 00:57:14,242
In wanting to take away my territory.

655
00:57:14,677 --> 00:57:20,650
So now he loses everything,
including you.

656
00:58:57,498 --> 00:58:59,733
.!

657
00:59:00,235 --> 00:59:01,870
.!

658
00:59:04,573 --> 00:59:06,276
.!

659
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,250
I am the spirit of Ji-Kin Chan Kauuilya,
He who Darkest the Sky.

660
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:21,926
I am the King, Jaguar, lord of the mountains.
You know me as a Lynx.

661
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:24,631
Your journey has just begun.

662
00:59:24,664 --> 00:59:28,068
It's time for your vision.

663
00:59:37,445 --> 00:59:41,049
Mexico, is no place for cowards.

664
00:59:41,116 --> 00:59:42,552
Save your brother.

665
00:59:42,685 --> 00:59:45,054
Save your family. Save me.

666
00:59:49,993 --> 00:59:51,762
TRUTH

667
00:59:57,636 --> 01:00:00,673
A kiss for you  mother, ..

668
01:00:17,193 --> 01:00:19,362
I hid in the mountains

669
01:00:19,428 --> 01:00:24,201
but you are hiding
within himself.

670
01:00:24,268 --> 01:00:27,238
It's not important where to hide, if ...

671
01:00:27,338 --> 01:00:29,207
hiding

672
01:00:29,407 --> 01:00:32,144
hidden for a reason.

673
01:00:44,458 --> 01:00:46,695
TRUTH

674
01:00:52,935 --> 01:00:55,571
I'm not putting the other cheek!

675
01:00:56,005 --> 01:00:59,776
Neither for man, nor for beast!

676
01:01:00,244 --> 01:01:01,245
I am!

677
01:01:01,346 --> 01:01:02,680
Armando Alvarez!

678
01:01:02,713 --> 01:01:03,814
Say it again.

679
01:01:03,881 --> 01:01:06,251
I am.. Armando Alvarez

680
01:01:06,284 --> 01:01:07,953
Let us do it once more.

681
01:01:07,987 --> 01:01:10,489
I am Armando Alvarez

682
01:01:11,123 --> 01:01:12,859
All right.

683
01:01:13,726 --> 01:01:18,599
I am

684
01:01:29,145 --> 01:01:30,814
He captured Sonia.

685
01:01:32,014 --> 01:01:34,318
I'm glad you're coming with me, too.

686
01:01:34,385 --> 01:01:36,954
No, Raul. I'm going alone.

687
01:01:41,826 --> 01:01:43,494
Do not be silly.

688
01:01:45,331 --> 01:01:48,734
I already had it for too long.

689
01:01:59,981 --> 01:02:01,616
Lynx on the phone. How to help?

690
01:02:01,716 --> 01:02:03,919
He gathered a small army.

691
01:02:04,286 --> 01:02:05,587
Let them.

692
01:02:05,687 --> 01:02:07,223
I'll take it.

693
01:02:07,423 --> 01:02:09,826
Just keep out the Americans.

694
01:02:10,794 --> 01:02:13,063
They did not
want to climb it.

695
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:15,299
They want you to
killed each other.

696
01:02:15,366 --> 01:02:16,734
Excellent.

697
01:02:17,469 --> 01:02:22,074
First we kill Raul,then we will take care
Of these pompous Americans.

698
01:02:22,107 --> 01:02:23,343
Ok?

699
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:25,278
Bye! Bye!

700
01:02:26,546 --> 01:02:27,914
Give me a minute.

701
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:32,019
Who the fuck thik he is this Lynx

702
01:02:32,119 --> 01:02:35,123
He thinks he can come
into my house without an invitation?

703
01:02:35,256 --> 01:02:37,492
Easily take my woman?

704
01:02:37,593 --> 01:02:38,993
No!

705
01:02:39,228 --> 01:02:42,566
I will not let him throw
a drop of my own blood!

706
01:02:44,134 --> 01:02:46,402
The Lynx fucked up !

707
01:02:46,803 --> 01:02:48,238
And you know what?

708
01:02:48,338 --> 01:02:51,308
We will not allow him to
to get away this time!

709
01:02:51,942 --> 01:02:55,246
He is a dead man!

710
01:03:04,858 --> 01:03:06,760
Come with your uncle ...

711
01:03:07,962 --> 01:03:10,731
I can give you all  Raul just promised ...

712
01:03:11,667 --> 01:03:13,434
and more.

713
01:03:15,738 --> 01:03:17,706
You are beautiful.

714
01:03:17,907 --> 01:03:19,342
Thank you.

715
01:03:22,279 --> 01:03:23,514
Slut!

716
01:03:25,917 --> 01:03:27,885
Nobody will come to your rescue

717
01:03:28,553 --> 01:03:31,557
He will come And will kill you.

718
01:03:31,589 --> 01:03:33,659
Who? Raul?

719
01:03:34,527 --> 01:03:36,763
I'm not talking about Raul.

720
01:03:39,866 --> 01:03:42,836
You mean that hairy shepherd.

721
01:03:42,970 --> 01:03:44,204
Yes ...

722
01:03:44,305 --> 01:03:47,375
Sonia, why deceive yourself

723
01:03:47,409 --> 01:03:49,278
I told you that I killed him.

724
01:03:49,345 --> 01:03:50,812
He's dead!

725
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:53,515
And the wind whispers to me,That he is not.

726
01:05:55,695 --> 01:05:58,364
that who's named the Linx

727
01:05:58,430 --> 01:06:00,566
My name is Armando Alvarez!

728
01:06:02,168 --> 01:06:04,271
I'm talking to you, Lynx!

729
01:06:04,338 --> 01:06:05,873
I'm surprised that you're alive.

730
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:07,707
I want the girl

731
01:06:08,509 --> 01:06:11,312
Let her go, and we leave in peace.

732
01:06:11,979 --> 01:06:15,617
You're joking?
I can kill you with one shot.

733
01:06:15,650 --> 01:06:18,754
I give you just one more chance.

734
01:06:18,954 --> 01:06:22,793
Let go of the woman,
and I will let you stay alive.

735
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:38,011
Armando run!

736
01:07:21,396 --> 01:07:24,366
Do you have a cigarette?

737
01:07:25,167 --> 01:07:26,134
Yes ...

738
01:07:26,201 --> 01:07:28,137
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

739
01:07:33,310 --> 01:07:34,845
Fuck, . ...

740
01:07:34,878 --> 01:07:37,882
You will never learn to roll one right?.

741
01:07:37,915 --> 01:07:39,851
I promise. I swear. I'm sorry.

742
01:07:39,885 --> 01:07:41,519
It'll do.

743
01:07:49,395 --> 01:07:51,198
Heck,

744
01:07:51,432 --> 01:07:54,835
I'm dying here, and you love me
such a muck of grass?

745
01:07:55,202 --> 01:07:59,041
I'm sorry.

746
01:08:04,213 --> 01:08:05,281
She ...

747
01:08:05,382 --> 01:08:07,216
loves you.

748
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:12,924
I just realized it. Go for it.

749
01:08:14,859 --> 01:08:18,129
It is a pity,
Dad would have loved to see it.

750
01:08:18,563 --> 01:08:20,332
Go for her ...

751
01:08:23,803 --> 01:08:25,271
It's all over ...

752
01:08:25,338 --> 01:08:26,673
I'll go see dad.

753
01:08:26,706 --> 01:08:28,742
Stay here, please!

754
01:08:28,843 --> 01:08:30,177
It's all over.

755
01:08:30,277 --> 01:08:33,614
Mexico will be a better place
without me ...

756
01:08:35,517 --> 01:08:37,419
It's time ...

757
01:09:36,189 --> 01:09:38,625
I am Armando Alvarez!

758
01:09:38,993 --> 01:09:40,794
I've come to kill you!

759
01:09:41,562 --> 01:09:43,632
How dare you come this way?

760
01:09:43,864 --> 01:09:46,768
So rude,without an invitation as well?

761
01:09:46,802 --> 01:09:49,471
You invited me when you took my woman.

762
01:09:49,538 --> 01:09:52,842
Do you want her? Then catch her!

763
01:10:23,846 --> 01:10:28,151
Well, now both die.

764
01:10:40,264 --> 01:10:42,334
"The fire bull"

765
01:11:10,366 --> 01:11:12,170
Fuck this

766
01:11:14,572 --> 01:11:17,675
I thought than ...

767
01:11:17,675 --> 01:11:19,203
when this would happen,

768
01:11:21,114 --> 01:11:22,479
I would be surrounded by people

769
01:11:24,217 --> 01:11:27,987
TV cameras ...

770
01:11:28,955 --> 01:11:32,192
The police ... Special Forces,

771
01:11:32,259 --> 01:11:35,563
President, and all that ...

772
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:41,604
Apparently, will not be like that ...

773
01:11:48,011 --> 01:11:49,848
Damn.

774
01:12:40,941 --> 01:12:44,078
You're under arrest

775
01:12:44,112 --> 01:12:47,082
for murder and drug trafficking.

776
01:12:47,148 --> 01:12:51,620
You will be extradited to the U.S.
where you will be judged.

777
01:12:51,687 --> 01:12:55,959
There will be no trial.

778
01:12:56,826 --> 01:12:59,430
This is for my mom!
Oh, you son of a bitch!

779
01:13:24,025 --> 01:13:27,763
You run out of luck
fucking wetback.

780
01:13:35,773 --> 01:13:38,842
Not all ... Americans

781
01:13:39,778 --> 01:13:42,547
are bad, ..

782
01:13:46,953 --> 01:13:51,224
Not all Mexicans
we are drug dealers.

783
01:13:53,927 --> 01:13:57,331
Are you ready, Sonia?
- Yes. Let's go home.

784
01:14:00,503 --> 01:14:03,406
Good bye!
Good bye

785
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:16,520
You want to walk?

786
01:14:31,451 --> 01:14:57,544
