ADAPTED FROM A TRUE STORY

3
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:52,818
<i>When you love someone,</i>
<i>you've gotta trust them.</i>

4
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,786
<i>There's no other way.</i>

5
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:58,289
<i>You've got to give them the key</i>
<i>to everything that's yours.</i>

6
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:00,955
<i>Otherwise, what's the point?</i>

7
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,897
<i>And, for a while,</i>
<i>I believed that's the kind of love I had.</i>

8
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,686
<i>Before I ever ran a casino,</i>
<i>or got blown up...</i>

9
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:19,321
<i>Ace Rothstein was a hell of a handicapper.</i>

10
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:20,761
<i>I can tell you that.</i>

11
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,802
<i>I was so good that whenever I bet,</i>
<i>I'd change the odds...</i>

12
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,599
<i>for every bookmaker in the country.</i>

13
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:28,140
<i>I'm serious, I had it down so cold...</i>

14
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,608
<i>that I was given paradise on Earth.</i>

15
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:35,171
<i>I was given one of the biggest casinos</i>
<i>in Las Vegas to run, the Tangiers...</i>

16
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:39,579
<i>by the only kind of guys that can actually</i>
<i>get you that kind of money.</i>

17
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:42,519
<i>$62, 700,000.</i>

18
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,554
<i>I don't know all the details.</i>

19
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:47,252
<i>In fact,</i>
<i>nobody knew all the details...</i>

20
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:48,919
<i>but it should've been perfect.</i>

21
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:53,295
<i>He had me, Nicky Santoro,</i>
<i>his best friend, watching his ass...</i>

22
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,136
<i>and he had Ginger,</i>
<i>the woman he loved, on his arm.</i>

23
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,364
<i>But in the end, we fucked it all up.</i>

24
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,564
<i>It should've been so sweet, too.</i>

25
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:06,202
<i>It turned out to be the last time</i>
<i>that street guys like us...</i>

26
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:09,372
<i>were ever given anything</i>
<i>that fucking valuable again.</i>

27
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,252
<i>Vegas was a place where suckers...</i>

28
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:18,256
<i>flew in every year on their own nickel...</i>

29
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:20,849
<i>and left behind about a billion dollars.</i>

30
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:24,727
<i>But at night, you couldn't see</i>
<i>the desert that surrounds Las Vegas.</i>

31
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,636
<i>But it's in the desert where lots</i>
<i>of the town's problems are solved.</i>

32
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,694
<i>Got a lot of holes in the desert...</i>

33
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,866
<i>and a lot of problems</i>
<i>are buried in those holes.</i>

34
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,671
<i>Except you gotta do it right.</i>

35
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,507
<i>You gotta have the hole already dug...</i>

36
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,877
<i>before you show up</i>
<i>with a package in the trunk.</i>

37
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:45,714
<i>Otherwise, you're talking about</i>
<i>30 or 45 minutes of digging.</i>

38
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,481
<i>Who knows who's gonna be coming along</i>
<i>in that time?</i>

39
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:51,387
<i>Before you know it,</i>
<i>you gotta dig a few more holes.</i>

40
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,085
<i>You could be there all fucking night.</i>

41
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:08,133
THE STRIP - LAS VEGAS
TEN YEARS EARLIER

42
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,005
<i>Who could resist?</i>

43
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:14,740
<i>Anywhere else, I was a bookie, a gambler...</i>

44
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:18,306
<i>always looking over my shoulder,</i>
<i>hassled by cops, day and night.</i>

45
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,318
<i>But here, I'm Mr. Rothstein.</i>

46
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,082
<i>I'm not only legitimate,</i>
<i>but running a casino.</i>

47
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,954
<i>And that's like selling people</i>
<i>dreams for cash.</i>

48
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,426
<i>I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert,</i>
<i>as my manager, and went to work.</i>

49
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,955
And this is Ronnie,
who takes care of the card room.

50
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,496
<i>For guys like me,</i>
<i>Las Vegas washes away your sins.</i>

51
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,598
<i>It's like a morality car wash.</i>

52
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:46,167
<i>It does for us what Lourdes does</i>
<i>for humpbacks and cripples.</i>

53
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,150
<i>And along with making us legit...</i>

54
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:58,317
<i>comes cash, tons of it.</i>

55
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:01,291
<i>What do you think we're doing</i>
<i>here in the middle of the desert?</i>

56
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,192
<i>It's all this money.</i>

57
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,796
<i>This is the end result</i>
<i>of all the bright lights...</i>

58
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,960
<i>and the comped trips,</i>
<i>of all the champagne...</i>

59
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:14,132
<i>and free hotel suites,</i>
<i>and all the broads and all the booze.</i>

60
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:18,334
<i>It's all been arranged</i>
<i>Just for us to get your money.</i>

61
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,140
<i>That's the truth about Las Vegas.</i>

62
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:25,306
<i>We're the only winners.</i>

63
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,546
<i>The players don't stand a chance.</i>

64
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,218
<i>And their cash flows from the tables...</i>

65
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,655
<i>to our boxes through the cage...</i>

66
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:35,794
<i>and into the most sacred room</i>
<i>in the casino.</i>

67
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,894
<i>The place where they add up all the money...</i>

68
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,934
<i>the Holy of holies, the count room.</i>

69
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,637
<i>Now, this place was off-limits.</i>

70
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,238
<i>Even I couldn't get inside.</i>

71
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:51,276
<i>But it was my job to keep it filled</i>
<i>with cash. That's for sure.</i>

72
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,312
<i>They had so much money in there...</i>

73
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:56,007
<i>you could build a house out</i>
<i>of stacks of $100 bills.</i>

74
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,016
<i>And the best part was that upstairs...</i>

75
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,076
<i>the Board of Directors didn't know</i>
<i>what the fuck was going on.</i>

76
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,418
<i>To them everything looked</i>
<i>on the up-and-up.</i>

77
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:05,013
<i>Right? Wrong.</i>

78
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,524
Verify $5,000.

79
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,822
<i>The guys in the counting room...</i>

80
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,693
<i>were all slipped in there</i>
<i>to skim the joint dry.</i>

81
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,927
<i>They'd do short counts,</i>
<i>they'd lose fill slips.</i>

82
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:17,492
<i>They'd even take cash</i>
<i>right out of the drop-boxes.</i>

83
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,504
<i>And it was up to this guy right here...</i>

84
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,699
<i>standing in front of $2 million...</i>

85
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:25,073
<i>to skim the cash off the top</i>
<i>without anybody getting wise...</i>

86
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,941
<i>the IRS or anybody.</i>

87
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,644
<i>Notice how in the count room</i>
<i>nobody ever seems to see anything.</i>

88
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:33,014
<i>Somehow, somebody's always looking</i>
<i>the other way.</i>

89
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,349
<i>Look at these guys. They look busy, right?</i>

90
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,889
<i>They're counting money.</i>
<i>Who wants to bother them?</i>

91
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:41,552
<i>I mean, God forbid they should make</i>
<i>a mistake and forget to steal.</i>

92
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,221
<i>Meanwhile, you're in and you're out.</i>

93
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:48,064
<i>Past the jag-off guard</i>
<i>who gets an extra $100 a week...</i>

94
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,829
<i>Just to watch the door.</i>

95
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:52,496
<i>It's routine. Business as usual...</i>

96
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:55,336
<i>in, out, hello, goodbye.</i>

97
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:56,807
<i>That's all there is to it.</i>

98
00:07:56,876 --> 00:08:00,505
<i>Just another fat fuck walking out</i>
<i>of a casino with a suitcase.</i>

99
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:04,275
<i>Now, that suitcase was going</i>
<i>straight to one place:</i>

100
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,080
<i>Right to Kansas City, which was as close...</i>

101
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,484
<i>to Las Vegas as the Midwest bosses</i>
<i>could go...</i>

102
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:11,750
<i>without getting themselves arrested.</i>

103
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:15,519
<i>That suitcase was all</i>
<i>the bosses ever wanted.</i>

104
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:18,423
<i>And they wanted it every month.</i>

105
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,927
<i>Now this old Mormon fuck here...</i>

106
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:29,405
<i>he had to fly in with suitcases</i>
<i>once a month, nice and easy.</i>

107
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:32,237
- Something smells good.
- They made us something to eat.

108
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,245
<i>The bosses</i>
<i>would come from all over:</i>

109
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,941
<i>Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee...</i>

110
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,744
<i>all over the Midwest...</i>

111
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:41,753
<i>and they would meet in this produce market</i>
<i>in Kansas City.</i>

112
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,652
<i>Nobody even knew it.</i>

113
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:46,320
<i>One of the guys made</i>
<i>his mother do the cooking.</i>

114
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,587
Do you ever see that guy Jerry Steriano?

115
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:51,152
<i>These old greaseballs</i>
<i>might not look it...</i>

116
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,561
<i>but believe me...</i>

117
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:55,601
<i>these are the guys</i>
<i>who secretly controlled Las Vegas.</i>

118
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,329
Mama, that man's here again.

119
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:59,735
<i>Because they controlled</i>
<i>the Teamsters Unión.</i>

120
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:03,241
<i>And that's where you had to go</i>
<i>to borrow money to buy a casino.</i>

121
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,743
Would you put in shrimp?
I would.

122
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:09,508
<i>Nobody got a Teamsters'</i>
<i>loan unless the guys in this room...</i>

123
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:12,413
<i>knew they were gonna get</i>
<i>their little suitcases.</i>

124
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:16,187
<i>Guys like this antique over here,</i>
<i>out of Detroit.</i>

125
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:21,315
<i>Or especially guys like Remo Gaggi,</i>
<i>the outfit's top boss.</i>

126
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:22,917
You got a round figure on it?

127
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:25,259
<i>Definitely the most</i>
<i>important guy in this room.</i>

128
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,231
About 20 pounds.
Around $700,000.

129
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,426
Good.

130
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,829
<i>It's a little early for Las Vegas...</i>

131
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:36,706
<i>but I want to welcome the ladies</i>
<i>and gentlemen of the gaming industry...</i>

132
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,710
<i>As far as the worid was concerned...</i>

133
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,303
<i>Andy Stone,</i>
<i>head of the Teamsters' Pensión Fund...</i>

134
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,610
<i>was a legitimate guy.</i>

135
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,109
<i>A powerful man.</i>

136
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:48,446
<i>He played golf with the President.</i>

137
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,887
On behalf
of the Teamsters' Pensión Fund...

138
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,117
I'm glad to present...

139
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:53,715
<i>But he also took orders.</i>

140
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,921
<i>When he was told to give</i>
<i>a pensión-fund loan to Philip Green...</i>

141
00:09:56,996 --> 00:10:00,124
...this check for $62,700,000...

142
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,028
for the new Tangiers.

143
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,125
<i>... he did what he was told.</i>

144
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:05,966
<i>Here was the perfect front man.</i>

145
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,666
<i>What the fuck else could he be?</i>
<i>He didn't know too much.</i>

146
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,265
<i>He didn't want to know too much...</i>

147
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:13,312
<i>especially that the bosses</i>
<i>made the Teamsters lend him money.</i>

148
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,780
<i>He wanted to believe they gave him</i>
<i>the money because he was smart.</i>

149
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:20,182
I say that knowing just how much
competition we have in this city.

150
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,820
<i>And where they got Green from?</i>

151
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:27,324
<i>Who the fuck knows?</i>

152
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:30,157
<i>All I know is that he was</i>
<i>an Arizona real-estate hustler...</i>

153
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:34,393
<i>who barely had enough gas money</i>
<i>to come and pick up his fucking check.</i>

154
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,467
<i>And it was the bosses' man...</i>

155
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,400
<i>Andy Stone, who gave all the orders.</i>

156
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,905
<i>Not the Chairman of the Board,</i>
<i>Philip Green.</i>

157
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,838
I understand.

158
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:48,345
<i>Now all they needed was...</i>

159
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:50,644
<i>someone they could trust to run the casino.</i>

160
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:54,447
<i>And who better than Ace?</i>
<i>He was already in Vegas a couple years...</i>

161
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:56,817
<i>and he had the fucking place clocked.</i>

162
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:59,652
<i>But typical Ace,</i>
<i>give him a shot to run a casino...</i>

163
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,352
<i>and he tries to talk you out of it.</i>

164
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,190
I don't know if I could do this.

165
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:05,730
The Gaming Commissión
would never give me a license.

166
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:08,665
I have at least 24 gambling
and bookmaking pinches on me.

167
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:12,033
You don't have to have a license
to work in a casino.

168
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,901
All you gotta do is apply for one.

169
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:16,533
The State law says that
you can work in a casino...

170
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,236
while they process your application.

171
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,244
They got a 10-year backlog.

172
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:22,041
What happens when they do find out?

173
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,979
Why would they want to find out?

174
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,611
We're putting $100 million here.
Why would they lock us out?

175
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,656
They'll never find out. All you
gotta do is keep changing your job title.

176
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:35,820
Like, from Casino Executive
to Food and Beverage Chairman.

177
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:39,125
Then they put your application
at the bottom of the pile.

178
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:43,231
I know guys who've worked there
for 30 years don't have a license.

179
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,829
It's a tough proposition, Andy.

180
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:49,100
If I did it, I'd have to run it my way.

181
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:50,403
You got it.

182
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,637
I'm serious. No interference.

183
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:55,941
Nobody's gonna interfere
with your running the casino.

184
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,607
I guarantee it.

185
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:03,016
<i>And that's how they got Ace</i>
<i>to take over.</i>

186
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:07,588
<i>They wanted him because Ace ate,</i>
<i>slept and breathed gambling.</i>

187
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:12,863
<i>They worked out a real cute job title, too...</i>

188
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,332
<i>Tangiers Public Relations Director.</i>

189
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:18,631
<i>But the only thing he ever directed</i>
<i>was the casino.</i>

190
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:23,369
<i>He made his first bet when he was 15,</i>
<i>and he always made money.</i>

191
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,708
<i>He didn't bet like you or me.</i>

192
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:28,139
<i>Having some fun with it, shit like that.</i>

193
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:30,239
Where did you learn how to deal?

194
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:32,873
<i>He bet like a fucking brain surgeon.</i>

195
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,709
Place the checks properly.

196
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,550
- That's the way you do it.
- Yes, sir.

197
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:38,647
<i>He had to know everything.</i>

198
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:41,124
<i>He'd find out the inside stuff</i>
<i>nobody else knew...</i>

199
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:43,457
<i>and that's what he'd put his money on.</i>

200
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:48,365
BACK HOME YEARS AGO
<i>Even back home, years ago...</i>

201
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,597
<i>when we first hung out,</i>
<i>he'd know if the quarterback was on coke...</i>

202
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,967
I'll take Columbia for $20,000.

203
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:55,233
<i>... if his girlfriend was knocked up.</i>

204
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:58,973
<i>He'd get the wind velocity</i>
<i>so he could judge the field goals.</i>

205
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:02,810
<i>He even figured out the bounce</i>
<i>you got off different kinds of wood...</i>

206
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:04,915
<i>on college basketball courts.</i>

207
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,951
<i>He'd be working on this day and night.</i>

208
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,283
<i>He knew everything about a game</i>
<i>he would bet on.</i>

209
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,983
Ace got down at $6,000.
Get me down at $6,000.

210
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,983
<i>Season after season...</i>

211
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,551
<i>the prick was the only guaranteed winner</i>
<i>I ever knew.</i>

212
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,291
<i>But he was so serious about it all...</i>

213
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,299
<i>that I don't think he ever enjoyed himself.</i>

214
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,426
<i>But that's just the way he was.</i>

215
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:29,032
<i>Back then, the bosses didn't give a fuck</i>
<i>whether he enjoyed himself or not.</i>

216
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,508
<i>To them, he was a cash register.</i>

217
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:34,737
<i>All they had to do was ring the bell</i>
<i>and take money.</i>

218
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,178
<i>Especially Remo...</i>

219
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:39,217
<i>who was a fucking degenerate gambler</i>
<i>who always lost.</i>

220
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,819
All those fucking sweeps.

221
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:44,378
<i>Unless Ace made his bets.</i>

222
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:45,582
Enough now!

223
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,856
<i>Ace made more money</i>
<i>for them on a weekend...</i>

224
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:51,488
<i>than I could do heisting joints for a month.</i>

225
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:55,023
<i>Whatever Ace picked up on the street,</i>
<i>he told Remo.</i>

226
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:58,265
<i>Fixed fights, doped horses...</i>

227
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,601
<i>crooked fucking zebras,</i>
<i>locked-in point spreads.</i>

228
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:03,641
<i>He told fucking Remo everything.</i>

229
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:06,405
<i>And, to tell you the truth, I don't blame him.</i>

230
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,071
<i>Keeping Remo happy with money...</i>

231
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:11,912
<i>was the greatest insurance policy</i>
<i>in the worid.</i>

232
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:14,043
Son of a bitch!

233
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,413
How did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?

234
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:19,249
Nobody ever had Oklahoma...
How'd you do it?

235
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,259
That's why they paid so well.

236
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:23,361
You see? Never tells me nothing.

237
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,454
What do we got on for next week?

238
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:29,159
It's a little too early. I'll know
by Thursday. Is that all right?

239
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,565
You'll come by the house?
I'll come by.

240
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:32,729
At 7:00.

241
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,836
Good job, my boy. Keep it up.

242
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:39,110
Hey, Nick.

243
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,839
I'll be right out.

244
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:44,807
See that guy? Keep a good eye on him.

245
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,049
He's making a lot of money for us.

246
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:50,384
And he'll continue making money for us,
so keep a good eye on him.

247
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:53,323
Not like the fucking Feds out there,
without brains.

248
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,256
Okay?
All right.

249
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,526
Want me to take this?

250
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:59,757
<i>Now, on top of everything else...</i>

251
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:02,596
<i>I gotta make sure nobody fucks</i>
<i>with the Golden Jew.</i>

252
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:05,159
Couple of shooters for the ladies.

253
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:08,132
<i>Yeah, we made a great pair.</i>

254
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:11,932
<i>I made book and Nicky made sure</i>
<i>we always collected.</i>

255
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,272
<i>The old men loved us, and why not?</i>

256
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:16,371
<i>They all made money with us.</i>

257
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,416
<i>How did Nicky collect?</i>

258
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:19,576
<i>Don't ask.</i>

259
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,246
Then where the fuck is the money?
I don't see it.

260
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,619
- Hi, Melissa, Heidi.
- Hi, Sam.

261
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:26,585
Who's this guy?

262
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:29,787
Get the fuck out. I laid nine.
It was eight.

263
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,693
Ace, tell him the line
on the Bears game.

264
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,529
- Eight.
- Lf he don't know, nobody knows.

265
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,929
It was eight.
How come I laid nine?

266
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:39,994
'Cause you're a jag-off.

267
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,834
- Excuse me.
- What?

268
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:45,499
- Is this your pen?
- Yeah, that's my pen. Why?

269
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,772
It's nice. I didn't know whose it was.

270
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,541
I didn't want it to get lost.

271
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,049
Thank you.
Why don't you take that fucking pen...

272
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,745
and shove it up your ass,
you fucking jag-off?

273
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,623
- Well, I was just offering...
- Asshole.

274
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,215
Look out, Joe.

275
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:23,904
What's that? You hear a little girl?

276
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,484
Is that a little fucking girl?

277
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,381
What happened to the tough guy...

278
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,786
who told my friend to stick it
up his fucking ass?

279
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:32,687
Nicky, take it easy.

280
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,860
<i>While I tried to figure out</i>
<i>why the guy said what he said...</i>

281
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,426
<i>Nicky just hit him.</i>

282
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:48,904
<i>No matter how big a guy might be,</i>
<i>Nicky would take him on.</i>

283
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:52,703
<i>You beat Nicky with fists,</i>
<i>he comes back with a bat.</i>

284
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:56,009
<i>You beat him with a knife,</i>
<i>he comes back with a gun.</i>

285
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,811
<i>If you beat him with a gun,</i>
<i>you'd better kill him...</i>

286
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:01,682
<i>because he'll keep coming back and back...</i>

287
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:03,847
<i>until one of you is dead.</i>

288
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,023
<i>With me protecting Ace...</i>

289
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,568
<i>he made a fortune for the bosses.</i>

290
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,735
<i>That's what got him to Vegas.</i>

291
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,798
<i>He was a money machine.</i>

292
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:27,302
<i>A tremendous earner for these guys.</i>

293
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:30,639
<i>As soon as he took over,</i>
<i>he doubled the fucking drop.</i>

294
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:34,077
<i>With Ace, the casino never saw</i>
<i>so much money.</i>

295
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,887
<i>And the bosses, they couldn't be happier.</i>

296
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:58,242
<i>In Vegas, I had to keep</i>
<i>a few juiced-in local cowboys working.</i>

297
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,778
<i>They were close to the good old boys.</i>

298
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:04,707
<i>Without us, these guys</i>
<i>would still be shoveling mule shit.</i>

299
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:06,717
You've got to keep a cleaner station.

300
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:08,912
If you need Mr. Clean, page him.

301
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,921
Won't happen again, Sam.

302
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:14,823
Mr. Rothstein.
It won't happen again, Mr. Rothstein.

303
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,953
Is this guy just another dumb fucking
white man, or what?

304
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,123
- You need this guy.
- Can't get rid of him?

305
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,929
He's juiced in.
He's the County Commissioner's cousin.

306
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,969
I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.

307
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:27,597
<i>I had no choice. I had to take care of them.</i>

308
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,468
<i>These yokels ran the state.</i>

309
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,735
Thanks, Senator.

310
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:33,141
<i>They passed the laws,</i>
<i>owned the courts.</i>

311
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:34,474
I need a room.

312
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,973
<i>I had dozens of politicians</i>
<i>and state officials coming through weekly.</i>

313
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:40,985
Get him what he wants.
Certainly.

314
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:43,044
<i>Why not make them happy?</i>

315
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,534
<i>For politicians,</i>
<i>like our State Senator up there...</i>

316
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,236
<i>everything was on the house.</i>

317
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,330
<i>These guys won their comped life</i>
<i>when they got elected.</i>

318
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,705
<i>Why not take advantage of it?</i>

319
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:08,704
<i>Still, the politicians came cheap.</i>
<i>We could handle them.</i>

320
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:11,409
<i>It's a whale, like K.K. Ichikawa...</i>

321
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:14,179
<i>who plays $30,000 a hand in baccarat.</i>

322
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:16,244
<i>That's the one you really gotta watch.</i>

323
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,484
<i>He plays fast and big.</i>
<i>He has the cash and the credit...</i>

324
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,492
<i>to turn out your lights.</i>

325
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,496
<i>A year ago he cleaned out a couple</i>
<i>of casinos in the Cayman Islands.</i>

326
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:27,623
<i>Downstairs he takes us for $2 million...</i>

327
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:31,499
<i>and upstairs he takes free soap,</i>
<i>shampoo and towels.</i>

328
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:35,270
<i>Another billionaire cheapskate</i>
<i>who loved his free rooms...</i>

329
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:38,537
<i>free private jets</i>
<i>and $2 million of our money.</i>

330
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,373
<i>But we got him back.</i>

331
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:44,040
<i>I had our pilot tell him</i>
<i>the plane was on the fritz.</i>

332
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:47,017
What went wrong?
I'm awfully sorry.

333
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,220
These mechanical things happen.

334
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,415
Better here than up there.

335
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,518
<i>Then he missed the flights</i>
<i>connecting with Japan.</i>

336
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:57,061
I can't believe there's no room.

337
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,301
<i>We got him back with</i>
<i>a whole floor of rooms to himself.</i>

338
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:08,396
- Sorry you missed your plane.
- You'd like some of my money back.

339
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:10,304
Oh, no. No gambling.

340
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,908
<i>And once he was back,</i>
<i>he played small.</i>

341
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:22,242
<i>He bet $1,000 a hand,</i>
<i>instead of his usual $30,000 a hand.</i>

342
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,792
<i>But I knew the trick</i>
<i>with whales like Ichikawa...</i>

343
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,328
<i>was that they can't bet small for long.</i>

344
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,898
<i>He didn't think of it as winning $10,000...</i>

345
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:36,457
<i>he thought of it as losing $90,000.</i>

346
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:39,069
<i>So, he upped his bets.</i>

347
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:47,237
<i>Until he dropped his winnings back</i>
<i>and gave up $1 million of his own cash.</i>

348
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:53,083
<i>In a casino, the cardinal rule</i>
<i>is to keep them playing...</i>

349
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:54,584
<i>and keep them coming back.</i>

350
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:57,247
<i>The longer they play, the more they lose.</i>

351
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,449
<i>In the end, we get it all.</i>

352
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:12,133
<i>In Vegas, everybody's gotta watch</i>
<i>everybody else.</i>

353
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:17,840
<i>Since the players</i>
<i>are looking to beat the casino...</i>

354
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:21,611
<i>the dealers are watching the players...</i>

355
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:25,846
<i>the boxmen are watching the dealers...</i>

356
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,851
<i>the floormen are watching the boxmen...</i>

357
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:32,016
<i>the pit bosses are watching the floormen...</i>

358
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,057
<i>the shift bosses are watching</i>
<i>the pit bosses...</i>

359
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,993
<i>the casino manager is watching</i>
<i>the shift bosses...</i>

360
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:40,293
<i>I'm watching the casino manager...</i>

361
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:43,129
<i>and the eye in the sky is watching us all.</i>

362
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:49,906
<i>Plus, we had a dozen guys...</i>

363
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:53,409
<i>most of them ex-cheats,</i>
<i>who knew every trick in the house.</i>

364
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,425
Yes!

365
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:18,832
- Very nice.
- I told you I was hot tonight.

366
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:31,939
Looking good.

367
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,451
Let's go. This is for Ginger.

368
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,885
Let me have $100 on your hard 10.

369
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:38,682
<i>Thank you.</i>

370
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,249
Here we go now.

371
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,229
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- The dice.

372
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:58,005
Thank you very much.

373
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,345
<i>I appreciate that.</i>

374
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,607
Take care, Steve. Take chances, drive fast.

375
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:09,084
This $100 is for you, love.
Thanks for your time.

376
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:11,686
- Come on.
- What's the matter?

377
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:15,152
I made a lot of money for you, I want my cut.

378
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,354
What money? I've seen you stealing.

379
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,363
"What money?" Look at the stack of chips.

380
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,661
I want my half.
I've watched you.

381
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,167
- I want my money.
- Your bag is full of chips.

382
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,535
I didn't steal anything from you.
Get lost!

383
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:29,403
Get lost?
Yes!

384
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:31,874
- Well, how about that?
- Come on!

385
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:26,625
<i>What a move. I fell in love right there.</i>

386
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:30,293
<i>But in Vegas, for a girl like Ginger,</i>
<i>love costs money.</i>

387
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:38,000
I'm gonna go powder my nose.

388
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:50,979
<i>Ginger's missión in life was money.</i>

389
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,148
I'll be right back.

390
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,215
See you.
Thanks for asking.

391
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:56,317
<i>She was a queen around the casino.</i>

392
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:59,955
<i>She brought in high rollers</i>
<i>and helped them spend a lot of money.</i>

393
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:02,122
- Hello.
- Hey, Ginger. How you doing?

394
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,658
Great. You might have
something for me. Got me covered?

395
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:08,270
Thank you.
Take care of yourself.

396
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,968
I got some lucky pills for you, Andy.

397
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:13,602
<i>Who didn't want her?</i>
<i>She was one of the best known...</i>

398
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,841
<i>best liked and most respected hustlers</i>
<i>in town.</i>

399
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:23,252
<i>Smart hustlers like her</i>
<i>could keep a guy awake...</i>

400
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:25,949
<i>for two or three days</i>
<i>before sending him home broke...</i>

401
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,254
<i>to the little woman and his bank examiners.</i>

402
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,708
Any change?

403
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:49,504
Oh, I hit a few games on the way back.

404
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:54,114
<i>But that was all bullshit.</i>
<i>She just pocketed the cash.</i>

405
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:58,622
How you doing tonight?
Good.

406
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,487
How are you?
Beat.

407
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,220
<i>Ginger had the hustlers' code.</i>

408
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:03,989
Take one for you.

409
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,120
Thank you.

410
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:07,061
<i>She knew how to take care of people.</i>

411
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:09,100
<i>That's what Vegas is all about.</i>

412
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,565
$6,800.
Thanks.

413
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:14,904
<i>It's kickback city.</i>
Have a good night.

414
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:22,303
<i>She took care of the dealers...</i>

415
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,644
<i>pit bosses, floor managers...</i>

416
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:27,482
<i>but, mostly, the valet parkers...</i>

417
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:30,988
<i>the guys who could get you anything</i>
<i>and take care of anything.</i>

418
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,023
<i>Ginger took care of the parkers...</i>

419
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:36,390
<i>who took care of the security guards,</i>
<i>who took care of the cops...</i>

420
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:37,860
<i>who let her operate.</i>

421
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,157
I need that stuff tonight.

422
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,755
No problem.
You are a doll.

423
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:44,165
<i>The valet parking job</i>
<i>was such a money-maker...</i>

424
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:47,796
<i>they had to pay off the hotel manager</i>
<i>Just to get the concessión.</i>

425
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,534
<i>But one thing I didn't understand...</i>

426
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,101
<i>was that she had everything under control...</i>

427
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,943
<i>except for her old pimp boyfriend,</i>
<i>Lester Diamond.</i>

428
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:59,984
I got other people in this. I got partners.

429
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:04,483
I'm looking out for you in this thing, okay?

430
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:08,355
You'll get yours back,
and you'll get it back first. Okay?

431
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,656
- All right.
- Where you going?

432
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:13,694
Where are you? You're in that place.

433
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:15,699
- I'm here.
- No, you're not.

434
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,324
Where are you?

435
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,929
I'm always here for you.

436
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,199
- You are.
- I am.

437
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:28,511
<i>The Ginger I knew</i>
<i>wouldn't even look at this creep.</i>

438
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:30,775
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

439
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:33,147
<i>He was a moocher, a card cheat...</i>

440
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:35,686
<i>a country club golf hustler, a scumbag...</i>

441
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:38,649
<i>- chasing dentists for a few bucks.</i>
- Careful.

442
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:41,123
<i>He was always broke.</i>
<i>He always had a story.</i>

443
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:43,683
<i>Somehow, she could never turn him down.</i>

444
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:47,128
<i>The way Ginger saw it</i>
<i>was that he was just an unlucky guy.</i>

445
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:49,189
<i>Somebody had to take care of him.</i>

446
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:50,759
BACK HOME

447
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,666
<i>But nobody had to take care of Nicky.</i>

448
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:55,467
You find any cash in there,
we'll whack it up with you.

449
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,804
<i>He took care of himself only too well.</i>

450
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:00,674
<i>That's why every badge back home</i>
<i>wanted to nail him.</i>

451
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:04,579
I folded these things beautifully.
I would appreciate a little respect.

452
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:07,277
Don't look at me, pal, I gotta live with her.

453
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:10,687
<i>Even after a vacation,</i>
<i>they hassled him at the airport.</i>

454
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:13,315
<i>Frank Marino was there to meet him.</i>
<i>So were the cops.</i>

455
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:15,154
<i>They wanted to pinch him...</i>

456
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:17,786
<i>- for a diamond burglary in Antwerp.</i>
- Help me fold these.

457
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:21,389
<i>They were ready to blame him</i>
<i>for anything, no matter where.</i>

458
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,262
<i>They were usually right.</i>

459
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:25,668
<i>Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster.</i>

460
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:28,103
<i>And he didn't give a damn who knew it.</i>

461
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:30,899
There we go. Look at that.
Beautiful!

462
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:33,538
<i>I mean that's what worried me...</i>

463
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:36,375
<i>'cause it turns out,</i>
<i>Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.</i>

464
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:39,474
All right, we're clear.
There's more.

465
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:42,216
There's a couple stuck in there.

466
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:44,187
- I'm telling you, they're out!
- Come on.

467
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:47,418
Don't get so defensive,
it could be stuck in your hair.

468
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,793
What's that?

469
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:53,688
There's no more. Thanks.

470
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:56,899
<i>I couldn't wait</i>
<i>to get my hands on Vegas.</i>

471
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:59,732
<i>But the bosses didn't send me out</i>
<i>to have a good time.</i>

472
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:02,967
<i>They sent me out to make sure</i>
<i>that nobody fucked with Ace.</i>

473
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:06,033
<i>And nobody interfered</i>
<i>with the fucking skim.</i>

474
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,805
- Hey.
- Hey, how you doing?

475
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:11,780
Hey, Sammy.

476
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:15,578
- Boy, look at this place.
- Incredible.

477
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:17,978
Welcome to Vegas.

478
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:20,422
Okay, Sammy.
Something, huh?

479
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,221
Ginger.

480
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:29,560
Holy shit. What've you been doing out here?

481
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:31,329
Honey, come here.

482
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:35,734
This is Jennifer and Nick.
They're dear friends of mine.

483
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,934
- Hi, Jennifer.
- A pleasure.

484
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:41,177
Okay, Sammy.

485
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,207
<i>After we ate,</i>
<i>we left Jennifer and Ginger...</i>

486
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,443
<i>and we took a ride to talk.</i>

487
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,645
<i>And then, he hit me with it.</i>

488
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:51,620
What do you think
about me moving out here?

489
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:55,386
You got a problem with that?

490
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,189
No, of course not.

491
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,696
You mean I have your permissión?

492
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:01,857
Sure, you do. But I just gotta tell you...

493
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:03,867
it's no joke out here.

494
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,027
<i>You gotta keep a low profile.</i>

495
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:09,072
It's not like back home.
They don't like guys like us.

496
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,131
<i>This sheriff's a real cowboy.</i>

497
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:13,905
Even coppers aren't afraid
to bury people in the desert.

498
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:17,072
I don't care. I want to get away
from back home for a while.

499
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,082
I'm tired of that shit back there.

500
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,947
Look at this place. It's made of money.

501
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:22,509
You know what the best part is?

502
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:24,555
Nobody's gonna know what we're doing.

503
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:27,682
There's nobody here to see us.
Everybody's back home.

504
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:29,726
I got pinched twice for no reason.

505
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:31,421
I really gotta be careful.

506
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,056
I'm running a licensed place.
Everything's legit.

507
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:36,760
Don't worry about it.
I'm not gonna do anything.

508
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:40,032
I'm especially not gonna involve you
in anything.

509
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,634
<i>Ace saw Vegas one way...</i>

510
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:47,041
Call and tell him I'm coming?
Of course.

511
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:48,738
<i>... but I saw it another.</i>

512
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:51,247
<i>I saw it as untouched.</i>

513
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:57,352
<i>They had bookies, pimps,</i>
<i>and drug dealers I could shake down.</i>

514
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:59,389
<i>Who the fuck were they gonna run to?</i>

515
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:01,322
<i>So I started getting everybody in line.</i>

516
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:04,122
<i>Best of all, for the first time in my life...</i>

517
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,527
<i>I figured out a way not to lose.</i>

518
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,629
<i>He had a foolproof scheme.</i>

519
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,793
<i>It wasn't very scientific, but it worked.</i>

520
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,166
<i>When he won, he collected.</i>

521
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:14,797
<i>When he lost,</i>
<i>he told the bookies to fuck off.</i>

522
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:18,502
<i>What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?</i>
<i>Nicky was the muscle.</i>

523
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:21,634
- Hey, how you doing?
- How you doing?

524
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:24,106
- You got that thing for me?
- What thing?

525
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:26,343
Nicky, I thought you was laying.

526
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,442
I was laying? No, I'm taking it.

527
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:31,212
- You sure?
- I'm positive.

528
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:35,318
- I'm a little confused.
- You're a little confused?

529
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:38,157
Maybe if I stick your fucking face
through this window...

530
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,821
you'll get unconfused.

531
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,695
- Give me the fucking money.
- I'm sorry.

532
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:43,165
I didn't mean anything by it.

533
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,930
That's why you had it ready.
You thought I was laying it.

534
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:48,529
- My fucking head.
- Smarten up.

535
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:53,873
And now Nicholas Santoro will come up
and tell us about our first President.

536
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:59,912
George Washington was born...

537
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:02,953
<i>But still, it was nice</i>
<i>and quiet for a while.</i>

538
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:05,682
<i>We presented Nicky and Jennifer</i>
<i>all over town...</i>

539
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,782
<i>like regular Ozzie and Harriets.</i>

540
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,394
You got a beautiful swing.

541
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:13,897
<i>Ace got Little Nicky</i>
<i>involved with Little League. It was great.</i>

542
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:17,492
<i>Turned out that one of the other coaches</i>
<i>was a metro intelligence cop.</i>

543
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:20,162
<i>But it didn't matter. It was all about the kids.</i>

544
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:22,706
He's gotta realize
everything can't be a home run.

545
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:26,642
That's exactly what I tell him,
but that's the kind of kid he is.

546
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:31,610
<i>And Nicky being Nicky,</i>
<i>he made his presence known.</i>

547
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:35,408
<i>Especially at the casino</i>
<i>where he definitely did not work...</i>

548
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:36,976
<i>people got the message.</i>

549
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:39,819
<i>Me, that's why</i>
<i>the bosses sent me out here.</i>

550
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:42,587
<i>I was to make sure no other crews</i>
<i>robbed the joint.</i>

551
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,094
<i>Like these two fucking balloon heads</i>
<i>over here.</i>

552
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:48,064
<i>They were gonna try to bang us</i>
<i>out of $200,000.</i>

553
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,861
<i>Yeah, right, I'm sure.</i>

554
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:51,799
How are you? What are you doing here?

555
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:53,097
I'm over here now.

556
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:56,072
- You're over here?
- Yeah, I'm over here with them.

557
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,002
We're waiting on Carmine.

558
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,014
Yeah, we're looking for Carmine.

559
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:07,245
He was here before.
He had a suitcase, and then he left.

560
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,142
Carmine left?

561
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:13,488
He's gone?

562
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:15,616
He's not here?

563
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,653
Carmine's out?

564
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:25,101
I think he went across the street
or somewhere else or something.

565
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,539
Well, listen, good luck with the joint.

566
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:32,871
- Thanks, Eddy.
- Lots of luck.

567
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:34,444
Good luck to you, too.

568
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,003
They forgot to sign their papers.

569
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:39,814
They don't need those anymore.

570
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:43,483
<i>Out of respect, guys</i>
<i>from other crews got away with a warning.</i>

571
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:45,681
<i>Everybody else, watch out.</i>

572
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:48,390
<i>Like these yokels here...</i>

573
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:50,927
<i>who never heard of Nicky</i>
<i>or the bosses back home.</i>

574
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:53,486
<i>They're the morons</i>
<i>who give you the most trouble.</i>

575
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:55,725
<i>We'd catch them</i>
<i>and they'd try to sneak back...</i>

576
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,360
<i>with beards and wigs and fake noses.</i>

577
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,939
<i>You can spot these assholes</i>
<i>by watching the way they bet.</i>

578
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:05,669
<i>Like this guy. He's betting lavender chips...</i>

579
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:08,075
<i>at $500 each with only one little problem.</i>

580
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:10,239
<i>He's always guessed right.</i>

581
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:16,514
<i>If he wasn't so fucking greedy,</i>
<i>he'd have been tougher to spot.</i>

582
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:19,147
<i>But in the end, they're all greedy.</i>

583
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:39,166
<i>I saw that the dealer was weak,</i>
<i>but he wasn't in on it.</i>

584
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,438
<i>He just wasn't protecting his hand.</i>

585
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:44,515
<i>He was lifting his hole card way too high.</i>

586
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:59,959
<i>Here's this guy</i>
<i>reading the dealer's hole card...</i>

587
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:03,033
<i>and signaling his buddy at this table.</i>

588
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:13,305
<i>And that's just what these hustlers look for.</i>

589
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:16,403
<i>They cruise from casino to casino</i>
<i>looking for weak dealers...</i>

590
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:19,109
<i>the way lions look for weak antelope.</i>

591
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:24,416
Operator, this is Mr. R.

592
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:28,152
Get me Armstrong and Friday
over to Pit 2 right away.

593
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:47,241
BJ 19, second base, the beard.

594
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:51,446
Operator, I need Mr. Happy. Loud.

595
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:55,977
<i>Happy birthday</i>
<i>to you</i>

596
00:35:56,687 --> 00:36:00,179
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

597
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:04,450
<i>Happy birthday, dear Jeff</i>

598
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:09,331
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

599
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,518
Man down!

600
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:34,682
<i>Go get medical.</i>
<i>We got a cardiac arrest here.</i>

601
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:38,525
He's fine, folks.
Just give us some room, please.

602
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:43,557
<i>They never know what hit them.</i>

603
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:47,092
<i>If and when they do find out</i>
<i>they got zapped by a cattle prod...</i>

604
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:50,299
<i>they wish they really did have a heart attack.</i>

605
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:58,539
<i>Turns out this guy and his fucking pals</i>
<i>were knocking this place dead for years.</i>

606
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:00,776
He's wired.
What are you doing?

607
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:02,614
There it is. That's it.

608
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:04,951
Cheater's justice.
Oh, God!

609
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:07,484
<i>No!</i>

610
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:13,691
<i>I wanted everybody to</i>
<i>know that things were changed around here.</i>

611
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:17,723
<i>We had to make an example of these pricks</i>
<i>that the party was over.</i>

612
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:19,268
I'm just curious.

613
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,305
I saw you shuffling your checks
with your right hand.

614
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:25,103
- Can you do that with both hands?
- No.

615
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:28,139
You can't do it with both hands?
No, sir.

616
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:31,579
- Can you do it with your left hand?
- I never tried.

617
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:34,344
- So, you're a righty.
- Yeah.

618
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,561
Now you're gonna have to learn
with your left hand.

619
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:49,693
- It's $100,000, $110,000 I think.
- Yes, it is.

620
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,060
Okay.

621
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:54,662
Hi.

622
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:58,573
That's a lot of money
to be counting out in public.

623
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:02,203
Why don't I take him
over to the office and verify it?

624
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,474
A little privacy.

625
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:06,710
By the way, send over
a nice bottle of champagne on ice.

626
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,547
Sure will.
Real special.

627
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,520
By the way, I'm Billy Sherbert,
casino manager.

628
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:13,622
Having a good time?
Yes.

629
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:15,955
You want to count the money in privacy.

630
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:19,019
I have a plane to catch.
Can I get my winnings?

631
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,124
Look what they did to my hand, man.

632
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:28,865
I'm gonna give you a choice:

633
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:32,773
You can have the money and the hammer,
or you can walk out of here.

634
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:35,004
- What do you want?
- I wanna get out of here.

635
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:38,276
Tell your friends what happens
if they fuck around here.

636
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:41,943
- I'm sorry, I made a bad mistake.
- You're fucking right.

637
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:45,648
If you come back, either one
of you, we'll break your fucking heads.

638
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:49,250
You see that fucking saw? We're gonna
use it. We don't fuck around here.

639
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,487
Got it?
Yes.

640
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:52,791
- Get out of here.
- Thank you.

641
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:56,433
Throw him out in the alley.
Tell the cops he got hit by a car.

642
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:58,728
<i>Within no time,</i>
<i>everything was set in place.</i>

643
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:02,068
<i>We got rid of the freelance scamsters,</i>
<i>the pro was way up...</i>

644
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:05,267
<i>the gods were happy,</i>
<i>or as happy as the gods can ever be.</i>

645
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,368
<i>And I decided to complicate my life.</i>

646
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:09,413
<i>For a guy who likes sure things...</i>

647
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,347
<i>I was about to bet the rest of my life</i>
<i>on a real long shot.</i>

648
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:14,247
We're not getting any younger.

649
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:16,081
Don't you think it's time?

650
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:19,884
Aren't you getting tired of all this shit?
Banging around, hustling around?

651
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:23,825
- Are you trying to handicap me?
- I'm gonna do you one better.

652
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:26,286
I'm trying to marry you.

653
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:28,961
You wanna marry me?

654
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,467
I'm serious.

655
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:36,201
I wanna settle down. I want a family.

656
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:38,833
You got the wrong girl, Sam.

657
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:41,540
I'd be a good father,
you'd be a good mother.

658
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:42,977
You don't know me.

659
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,811
You've known me two, three months.
What do you know?

660
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:48,613
I'm 43 years old. I don't want to wait.

661
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:52,486
I know you well enough
to know that I really love you very much.

662
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,657
I can't think of anybody better to be with.

663
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,286
I don't feel like waiting anymore.

664
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,799
You know a lot of happily married people?
'Cause I don't.

665
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,396
I know all that.

666
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,703
I care about you.

667
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:17,004
But I just don't have
those kind of feelings for you.

668
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:21,376
I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.

669
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:26,148
All right.
Understand?

670
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,524
I'm sorry.

671
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:31,487
No...

672
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:37,432
That can grow.

673
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:41,164
As long as there's a mutual respect,
that kind of thing can grow.

674
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:44,173
I'm realistic. I can accept that.

675
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:47,007
What is love anyway?

676
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,906
It's a mutual respect. It's a devotion.

677
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:52,881
It's a caring from one person to another.

678
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:56,782
And if we could set up
some kind of foundation...

679
00:40:57,588 --> 00:41:00,022
based on that mutual respect...

680
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:03,719
I feel that eventually
you would care enough about me...

681
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:06,092
that I could live with that.

682
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:09,560
If it doesn't work out...

683
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:12,634
if it doesn't play out,
then what happens to me?

684
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:15,796
I'm doing well now.
I'm gonna do even better.

685
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:17,806
So whatever happens...

686
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:20,176
if it doesn't work out between us...

687
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:22,872
I'll make sure you're okay
for the rest of your life.

688
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:25,381
If there are kids, especially...

689
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:27,710
I'll take care of you better
than you'd imagine.

690
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:30,913
What are you pitching me?
Just what I said.

691
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:34,288
You'll be set up for the rest of your life.

692
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:36,325
That I can promise you.

693
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:42,398
Want to take a chance?

694
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,777
<i>When I married Ginger,</i>
<i>I knew all the stories...</i>

695
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,541
<i>but I didn't give a fuck.</i>
<i>I'm Sam Rothstein, I said.</i>

696
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:59,344
<i>I can change her.</i>

697
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,842
<i>It was typical Ace.</i>

698
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:06,253
<i>He invited the biggest people in town.</i>
<i>He knew they'd show.</i>

699
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:08,757
<i>He knew they all wanted</i>
<i>something from him.</i>

700
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:12,091
<i>With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride.</i>
<i>Even Ginger.</i>

701
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:14,062
<i>With her, he still covered his bets.</i>

702
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:17,191
<i>They had to have the baby first,</i>
<i>before they could get married.</i>

703
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:19,793
<i>He even made us watch Amy</i>
<i>for a few days...</i>

704
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,701
<i>when they went on their honeymoon.</i>

705
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:24,172
<i>I didn't mind, we loved the kid.</i>

706
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:30,008
<i>Can you feel my eyes on you?</i>

707
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:33,609
<i>Can you feel me look into your heart?</i>

708
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:37,344
<i>Can you feel me in the pit of your stomach?</i>

709
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:42,015
<i>Can you feel me in you?</i>

710
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,119
<i>In your heart?</i>

711
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:49,690
<i>Don't make me come there.</i>

712
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:51,699
<i>Answer me.</i>

713
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,760
<i>I love you.</i>

714
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:56,067
Baby, do you know that I love you, too?

715
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,335
<i>No, Lester.</i>
Do you know that?

716
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:59,569
<i>Yes.</i>

717
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:02,737
<i>This is the best thing I can do</i>
<i>for my life right now.</i>

718
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:04,074
That's right.

719
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:05,978
<i>So it's going to be okay.</i>

720
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,347
Promise?

721
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,250
I wish you all the luck in the worid.

722
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:13,148
<i>You do?</i>
Yeah, I do.

723
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:16,526
It's the best thing you can do right now.

724
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:18,528
I mean this.

725
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:20,687
You have real security.

726
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:24,698
Sweetheart, you're gonna be situated
just right in Vegas.

727
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,100
<i>Come on. This is great for us.</i>

728
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:30,870
<i>I'm always gonna be here for you.</i>
<i>I ain't going no place.</i>

729
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:34,741
<i>I'm looking at you right now.</i>

730
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:38,545
<i>I'm seeing you for the very first time,</i>
<i>right this minute.</i>

731
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,880
<i>I'm saying I can feel my heart click.</i>

732
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:43,277
<i>I see you 14 years old.</i>

733
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:46,346
<i>I see you the first second I ever saw you.</i>

734
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,258
<i>I see you, long-legged little colt...</i>

735
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,555
<i>stupid braces on your teeth.</i>

736
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:52,687
Okay, then.

737
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:55,493
<i>Every time I see you,</i>
<i>that's what I see.</i>

738
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:58,065
Talk to you later. Bye.

739
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:06,976
- You all right?
- Yeah.

740
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,943
Why are you crying?

741
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,542
I'm not crying.

742
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:23,123
- Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.
- I'm okay.

743
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:29,960
You just have to understand.

744
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:32,831
I've been with Lester since I was a kid.

745
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:37,738
I just wanted to say goodbye.

746
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:39,974
I just...

747
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:44,906
I think I have a right to do that.

748
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:48,911
Okay?

749
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:50,578
It's all right.

750
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:54,449
That part of your life is over with.

751
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,220
Right?
Yeah.

752
00:44:57,594 --> 00:44:59,357
You're with me now.

753
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:01,921
- Yeah.
- Right?

754
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:07,203
You're sure?
Yeah.

755
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,904
Want to go? Let's go back in.
Okay.

756
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:39,668
It's great.

757
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:52,910
It's all my stuff. Oh, my God.

758
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:55,743
You brought all my stuff!

759
00:45:55,986 --> 00:45:57,317
I can't...

760
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,856
Try it on. It's yours.

761
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:02,983
You're kidding.

762
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:06,090
My God.

763
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,421
- What is it?
- It's chinchilla.

764
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:11,557
It's so soft.

765
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:14,428
Nice, isn't it?

766
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:21,643
No one's ever been so nice to me.

767
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:34,657
Oh, my God!

768
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:39,992
Do you think it's too much
if I wear these all on the same day?

769
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:42,088
You can do whatever you want.

770
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:45,026
Do I keep my promises
or do I keep my promises?

771
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:48,037
You're so wonderful.
The jewelry's not so bad either.

772
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:51,905
We shouldn't keep this in the house.
We gotta put it in the bank.

773
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:54,910
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?

774
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,809
Pay attention to me.

775
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,916
What I'm gonna tell you is very important.

776
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:03,077
All this stuff doesn't mean anything.

777
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,747
Money, this, doesn't
mean anything without trust.

778
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:08,314
I have to be able to trust you with my life.

779
00:47:18,802 --> 00:47:22,238
<i>With over $1 million in</i>
<i>cash and jewels tucked in a bank in Vegas...</i>

780
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:24,900
<i>only for Ginger, she was secure and happy.</i>

781
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:26,806
<i>She loved that shit.</i>

782
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:31,141
<i>But a guy in my line of work</i>
<i>has to have a lot of payoff cash around.</i>

783
00:47:31,248 --> 00:47:34,183
<i>Crooked cops and kidnappers,</i>
<i>they don't take checks.</i>

784
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:36,343
Need any help with that, Mr. Collins?

785
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,945
<i>So I put $2 million cash</i>
<i>in a Los Ángeles bank...</i>

786
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:42,014
<i>under the name</i>
<i>of Mr. And Mrs. Tom Collins.</i>

787
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:45,784
<i>This was strictly</i>
<i>my shakedown and kidnapping money.</i>

788
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:54,126
<i>Since I'd be in jail or locked in a closet</i>
<i>when I needed the money most...</i>

789
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:58,538
<i>I gave Ginger the only key to the cash</i>
<i>that could get me back alive.</i>

790
00:48:11,488 --> 00:48:14,013
This is just a signature card.

791
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:17,425
Once she signs, she'll be the only person...

792
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:21,055
to have total access to the box,
no one else, including myself?

793
00:48:21,164 --> 00:48:24,031
That's right. That's the way
you wanted it.

794
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:26,661
Sam, let me ask you a question.

795
00:48:27,337 --> 00:48:29,805
You must really trust your wife.

796
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:33,667
Sure I do. Why?

797
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:37,010
It's good. It's just unusual.

798
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:40,872
To tell you the truth,
so many of my clients don't.

799
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:58,659
<i>With Ginger and the money</i>
<i>in place, I felt covered.</i>

800
00:48:58,735 --> 00:49:01,295
<i>To play it safe, I switched job titles again...</i>

801
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:04,272
<i>and made myself</i>
<i>Food and Beverage Director.</i>

802
00:49:04,374 --> 00:49:07,036
<i>This way nobody would bother me</i>
<i>about a license.</i>

803
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,101
<i>Vegas was like a dream for me.</i>

804
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:11,874
<i>Trouble was Nicky was dreaming</i>
<i>of his own kind of Vegas.</i>

805
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:15,350
<i>I put money out on the street</i>
<i>charging three points a week.</i>

806
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:16,613
<i>Juice to the dealers.</i>

807
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:20,054
- Don't make us look for you.
- You won't have to look for me.

808
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:22,057
I appreciate it. Thanks, Nicky.

809
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,685
<i>They were degenerate</i>
<i>gamblers, coke freaks.</i>

810
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:28,788
<i>In no time, I had half the dealers</i>
<i>in the Tangiers in my pocket.</i>

811
00:49:28,899 --> 00:49:33,461
<i>Then, the next thing I did, I started</i>
<i>busting out high-stakes poker players.</i>

812
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:35,060
<i>It was so obvious.</i>

813
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:38,335
<i>All of Nicky's half-assed mechanics,</i>
<i>they were signal-happy.</i>

814
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:40,103
I'm gonna open for $500.

815
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:42,269
<i>Signaling back and forth.</i>

816
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,850
<i>Nicky thought nobody was watching him.</i>
<i>But he was wrong.</i>

817
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:51,615
<i>I didn't want any of those agents</i>
<i>near my place.</i>

818
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:54,213
- Four aces.
- I can't believe this.

819
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:58,850
If I didn't have bad luck,
I wouldn't have any luck.

820
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:02,989
<i>I wished Nicky and his whole crew</i>
<i>would just get lost.</i>

821
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:05,500
<i>What am I gonna do?</i>
<i>Go back home and start a war?</i>

822
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:08,265
<i>Nicky's a made guy and I'm not.</i>
<i>I can't do that.</i>

823
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,397
Gaming agents are all over the place.

824
00:50:10,474 --> 00:50:12,840
I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?

825
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:16,106
You've been lucky all week.
They're looking to nail you.

826
00:50:17,748 --> 00:50:19,841
<i>Ace was so worried</i>
<i>about his casino...</i>

827
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:23,181
<i>he forgot what we were doing out here</i>
<i>in the first place.</i>

828
00:50:23,286 --> 00:50:25,754
<i>A million times,</i>
<i>I wanted to yell in his fucking ear:</i>

829
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:27,517
<i>"This is Las Vegas.</i>

830
00:50:27,624 --> 00:50:31,185
<i>"We're supposed to be out here robbing,</i>
<i>you dumb fucking hebe. "</i>

831
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:38,567
I don't give a shit who he's connected to.

832
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:40,603
Tell him to take his feet off the table.

833
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:43,764
Does he think
this is a goddamn sawdust joint?

834
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,604
Sir, would you mind
taking your feet off the table...

835
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:48,371
and put your shoes on, please?

836
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:51,346
Yeah, I would mind. I'm having a bad night.

837
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:55,213
Fucking asshole won't budge.

838
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:57,209
Call security.

839
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:02,057
How are you?

840
00:51:02,692 --> 00:51:03,784
Good. How are you?

841
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:07,557
Do me a favor. Want to take your feet off
the table and put your shoes on?

842
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:08,962
Fuck you.

843
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:15,302
I want you to exit this guy
off the premises, off his feet...

844
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:17,863
and use his head to open the fucking door.

845
00:51:17,974 --> 00:51:21,535
Sir, you're gonna have to leave.
You mind coming with us outside?

846
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:24,275
Bullshit. I ain't going anywhere with you.

847
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:26,781
Bullshit. You're out of here.
Fuck you!

848
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:29,717
You know who you're fucking with?
Do you?

849
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:33,155
<i>You fucking faggot!</i>
<i>Do you know who you're fucking with?</i>

850
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:34,815
Leave me alone!

851
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:38,052
Come on!
You gotta be kidding me!

852
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:40,829
<i>Sure enough, an hour later,</i>
<i>I get the call.</i>

853
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:44,731
Ace, what happened over there?
Did you know that guy was with me?

854
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:46,996
I didn't know that. You know what he did?

855
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:50,528
I walked over to him politely,
and he tells me to fuck myself.

856
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:53,167
Then he called me a faggot.
What?

857
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:55,538
<i>I threw that cocksucker out.</i>
Come here.

858
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:58,672
You called my friend a faggot?
Told him to go fuck himself?

859
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:02,013
Is that what you did?
Tell him to go fuck himself?

860
00:52:02,085 --> 00:52:04,485
<i>You fucking hick, you!</i>

861
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:08,355
You go over there. You apologize.

862
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:10,552
You better hope he lets you back in.

863
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:13,653
<i>If you get out of line again,</i>
<i>I'll smash your head so hard...</i>

864
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:17,359
you won't be able
to get that cowboy hat on. Fucking hick.

865
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:21,595
Listen, this guy obviously doesn't know
who he was talking to.

866
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:24,640
He doesn't know that we're dear friends.

867
00:52:24,774 --> 00:52:26,799
He's already very sorry.

868
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:29,673
But if you could do me a favor
and let him back in...

869
00:52:29,746 --> 00:52:32,044
I swear he'll never get out of line again.

870
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:34,481
If he does it again, he's out for good.

871
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:36,745
I'll never let him in the place again.

872
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,651
<i>I'm sorry about this.</i>

873
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:41,585
All right, Ace? Thanks, pal.

874
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:46,320
You took your boots off?
You put your feet on the table?

875
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:50,593
You shit-kicking, stinky,
horse-manure-smelling motherfucker, you!

876
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:53,727
You fuck me up over there,
I'll stick you in a hole in the desert.

877
00:52:53,803 --> 00:52:56,397
Go over and apologize.
Nicky, I'm sorry.

878
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,975
<i>Ace could be a very touchy guy.</i>

879
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:05,240
<i>Especially when he got bigger in town.</i>

880
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:08,614
<i>Like when he hired Jonathan and David</i>
<i>away from the Palace...</i>

881
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:12,280
<i>by building them a new stage</i>
<i>and giving them a silver Rolls-Royce.</i>

882
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:15,217
<i>But, I tell you,</i>
<i>he knew how to bring in the crowds.</i>

883
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:17,351
<i>He knew all the fucking angles.</i>

884
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:20,361
<i>He brought the whole</i> Femme Fatale <i>show</i>
<i>from Paris...</i>

885
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:23,455
<i>but he forgot how lazy them</i>
<i>European dancing broads can get.</i>

886
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:27,435
<i>He had to weigh them once a week</i>
<i>so they wouldn't blow up like balloons.</i>

887
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:29,438
You're still eight pounds over.

888
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:32,031
- What's the reason for this?
- Mr. Rothstein, sir...

889
00:53:32,108 --> 00:53:35,305
Never mind the "sir."
Why is she eight pounds over?

890
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,471
I'm trying to use respect.

891
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:40,107
Mr. Rothstein is good enough for you.

892
00:53:40,183 --> 00:53:43,846
Well, sometimes when you put
that pressure point on them...

893
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:46,980
All you do is give me answers.
Just give me the right answer.

894
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:50,925
I don't know why. She's frightened
if she doesn't lose weight she'll get fired.
