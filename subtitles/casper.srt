00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,312
Okay.

3
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,808
One picture and we're history.

4
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:01,482
That's what I'm afraid of.

5
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,854
Come on.

6
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,542
Oh, man, do we have to do this?

7
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:27,420
You want everyone in school
to think we're chicken?

8
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:28,879
I could live with that.

9
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,053
You wuss. Come on.

10
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,271
I don't see anything. Do you?

11
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:48,070
No, I don't see anything.

12
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,862
Let's just take the picture
and get out of here.

13
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:55,866
Fine. Here, take the picture.

14
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:01,954
Wait, I should be in the picture, too,
or no one will believe I was here.

15
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,414
Shut up and take the picture!

16
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:04,707
You take the picture.

17
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,250
- You take it!
- You!

18
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:09,721
Guys, don't fight.
I'll take the picture.

19
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,887
Say "cheese."

20
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:17,094

To hell with the livestock. What
did the old stiff leave me?

27
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:12,233
I believe that what the
bereaved is trying to express

28
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:16,654
is that the sudden death
of her only father

29
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:21,200
has left a great gaping void
in her bank... in her life.

30
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:26,832
And Carrigan wonders what he
has left her to fill it up with.

31
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,751
Let's see.

And?

37
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:47,351
And I'm late for lunch,
so if you'll excuse me...

38
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:51,981
Are you telling me that I just spent the
last two days holding his clammy hand

39
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:56,026
waiting for him to kick it, and all I
get is one lousy piece of property?

40
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,404
No, it was lousy 50 years ago.

41
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,454
Now it's condemned. Enjoy.

42
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:07,413
Wait a minute. This is not fair!

43
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:11,500
I'll contest, and then I'll drag you and
all of those damned dolphins into court.

44
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,594
Knock yourself out.

45
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,423
Dibs, this is all your fault.

46
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,551
As usual. If you would have
just forged the damn will.

47
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:23,304
This is condemned
seafront property.

48
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:26,183
Dibs, don't you get it?

49
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,934
Flipper got more money than me.

50
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,813
Carrigan! The deed's in there!

51
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,650

Treasure?

55

Dibs, you idiot! Get it out.

56
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:07,765
I knew that place was worth something.
There's treasure in that house

57
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:11,941
and finally, I'm going
to get what I deserve.

58
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,855
Carrigan, I think I need a doctor.

59
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,903
There's plenty in Maine.

60
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,796
So, what do you think?

61
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:41,178
I think you're going to get wet.

62
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,143
Wait! Carrigan!

63
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,487
Dibs, light!

64
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,415
What a dump.

65
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,626
This place is fabulous.

66
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,379
You could just do so much with it.

67
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,349
- I know it's a bit spooky.
- Dibs.

68
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,806
Hello.

69
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,436
Who is it?

70
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,104
Afraid I can't answer that.

71
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,652
Why not?

72
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,817
It's kind of hard to explain.

73
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,235
Is he the caretaker?

74
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,154
Are you the caretaker?

75
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,739
No.

76
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,073
Is he a drug dealer?

77
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:51,160
Is he... Are you a transient?

78
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,745
No, not exactly.

79
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,246
Then tell him to show himself.

80
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,748
Show yourself!

81
00:06:55,749 --> 00:07:00,425
Here's the thing. If I do, don't
scream, okay? I get that a lot.

82
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,381
Are you a burglar?

83
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,508
I must warn you that I am armed.

84
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,720
Hello?

85
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:14,600
Cut the crap. If you don't show yourself,
I'll have you arrested for trespassing.

86
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,445
Okay, calm down, lady.

87
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,447
Here I come!

88
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,369
Hi! I'm Casper.

89
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,074
No, you shouldn't do that,
or you'll wake the...

90
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,127
Too late.

91
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:10,615
So tell me. You have experience?

92
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:15,077
I have quite a bit of experience. Not,
you know, like, exactly doing it,

93
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:18,956
but I've studied it, and I've
talked to people who have done it.

94
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:23,794
I've seen the videos, and I feel very
confident that with my knowledge

95
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:26,046
I could do it, no problem.

96
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,299
Then you can handle this?

97
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:33,976
It's like no problem whatsoever.
Piece of cake. Piece of crumb cake.

98
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,354
Well? How did it go?

99
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:20,610
It was fine. Was no
problem. Piece of cake.

100
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,652
Who you gonna call?

101
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,322
Someone else.

102
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,908
What do we do now?

103
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,832
What do I usually do when
something stands in my way?

104
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:57,846
Are you sure we're not going
a tad overboard here?

105
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:01,350
Dibs, I have huffed and puffed. Now
I want to rip this place down.

106
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:05,270
I want my treasure. They can't haunt
a pile of rubble, for Christ's sake.

107
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,027
People, please!

108
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,947
You're sweaty male construction
types, for Christ's sake!

109
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,995
Dibs, do something!

110
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,289
Come on, get out of there!

111
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,793
Charlie, quick, keep running and
don't look back! Run, Charlie!

112
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:31,218
Wait! They were just
kidding! Honest!

113
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,517
Every time.

114
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,219
All I want is a friend.

115
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:41,557
<i>Did you ever feel the way
Priscilla Cow felt</i>

116
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:45,062
<i>that you'd like to be
completely different?</i>

117
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:49,231
<i>Almost everybody feels
like that once in a while.</i>

118
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,233
<i>But most of the time</i>

119
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:54,863
<i>I hope you can be
glad to be yourself.</i>

120
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:58,412
<i>That's really something
to celebrate.</i>

121
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,754
<i>A ghost!</i>

122
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:08,750
<i>More on the Pentagon playboys
as the story unfolds.</i>

123
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,877
<i>But, now...</i>

124
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:13,422
<i>step aside, Sigmund Freud.
Jump back, Joyce Brothers.</i>

125
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:17,427
<i>It's Dr. James Harvey,
therapist to the dead?</i>

126
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:21,096
<i>Are you depressed? Are
you anxious? Are you lonely?</i>

127
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,265
<i>Do you need someone to talk to?</i>

128
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,517
<i>No problem, if you're a ghost!</i>

129
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:31,940
<i>You can call them ghosts if you like,
or as I prefer, the living impaired.</i>

130
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,866
<i>But the bottom line is,
they need help sometimes</i>

131
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,614
<i>just like the rest of us.</i>

132
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:41,950
<i>After the sudden unexpected
death of his wife, Amelia,</i>

133
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,912
<i>Dr. Harvey gave up
conventional psychiatry</i>

134
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:47,289
<i>and some say conventional sanity.</i>

135

<i>Now, along with his loner
daughter, Kat, short for Kathy</i>

depressed and the dead.</i>

138
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,638
<i>How do you feel about
your father's livelihood?</i>

139
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,473
<i>Please don't ask me any questions.</i>

140
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,808
<i>Do you believe in
ghosts? Ever seen one?</i>

141

<i>Does your father

<i>He's my father.</i>

143
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,105
<i>Could you just talk to us?</i>

144
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,816
<i>Look, it's the first day of school</i>

145
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:18,161
<i>and I'm sure I'll have homework,
so could you please...</i>

146
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,578
Carrigan.

147
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,351
What part don't you understand?

148
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:45,849
No, not "I ate fish." I hate fish.

149
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,893
Don't you people have cows here?

150
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:51,645
Listen, I have had a
long and tiring day.

151
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:55,857
Do you think that you could bring me a
pint of Häagen-Dazs ice cream, rum raisin

152
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:59,362
and a Diet Pepsi? Think
you can handle that?

153
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:03,157
Now you want me to hold. Fine.

154
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:07,202
<i>...and with therapy they can
begin to process this pain.</i>

155
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:11,378
<i>They can pack up their emotional
baggage, and they can move on.</i>

156
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:16,211
<i>My Harry passed away five years
ago, but he was so miserable.</i>

157
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,547
<i>His spirit would not
leave the apartment.</i>

158
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:22,018
<i>So I called Dr. Harvey.
He came over</i>

159
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:25,395
<i>and in a few weeks Harry left</i>

160
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:26,763
<i>smiling.</i>

161
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:30,859
<i>The living-impaired are
known for haunting us.</i>

162
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,687
<i>My question is,
what's haunting them?</i>

163
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:36,231
<i>It's a lack of resolution.</i>

164
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,109
<i>Ghosts are simply spirits
without resolution.</i>

165
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:43,615
<i>With unfinished business. And it's
my job to find out what that is.</i>

166
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,908
<i>And so Dr. James Harvey
continues his work</i>

167
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:51,079
<i>dragging his daughter along for the
ride. This week they're in Santa Fe,</i>

168
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,582
<i>but next week, "boo" knows?</i>

169
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,751
<i>Now, from the ghost
shrink to shrinking...</i>

170
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:59,381
Yes, I'm still here.
Get me Santa Fe.

171
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,102
<i>That's life!</i>

172
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:17,322
<i>That's what all the people say</i>

173
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:20,238
<i>You're ridin' high in April</i>

174
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:22,286
<i>Shot down in</i>

175
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,324
I'm sorry about your
Cactus Spooners.

176
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:28,450
Crooners.

177
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:31,828
I don't care what they said,
you are not demented.

178
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,622
You're a picture of mental health.

179
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,125
They were talking about you.

180
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:41,093
Try explaining afterlife therapy
to a bunch of junior high kids.

181
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,466
Some people go through life
never questioning the norm.

182
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:47,844
But you and I, we're doing something
extraordinary with our lives.

183
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,639
No, we aren't doing anything.

184
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,644
You're the one who's been packing up my
stuff and moving me around the country.

185
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:59,481
I mean, in two years, I have
been to nine different schools.

186
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:02,150
I've eaten in nine
different cafeterias.

187
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,153
I mean, I can't even
remember anyone's name.

188
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,698
For once, I would just like to be

189
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,785
in one place long enough
to make a friend.

190
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,495
Honey, you will.

191
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,122
Right.

192
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:18,166
I mean, come on, we're
moving to Friendship, Maine.

193
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,626
Even I might make one.

194
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,504
You better, Dad, 'cause
a single guy your age

195
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:26,883
is more likely to become a bank
hostage than to make new friends.

196
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:31,142
You sound like your mother.

197
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:36,311
You're not gonna find her.

198
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,854
Mom's not a ghost, Dad.

199
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:44,694
Yes, she is. She has
unfinished business.

200
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,871
There's no such thing as ghosts.

201
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,205
I'll tell you what

202
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,875
you go with me this one last time.

203
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:03,880
If I don't find what I'm
looking for, then it's over.

204
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:07,265
No more moving,
no more ghost mining.

205
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:09,685
You promise?

206
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,230
I promise.

207
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,729
Deal.

208
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,912
It's not so bad.

209
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,407
If you're Stephen King.

210
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:02,163
Dr. Harvey, hello.
I'm Carrigan Crittenden.

211
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,540
And this is Dibs.

212
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:07,170
Hello. I'm a close personal friend.

213
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:11,006
And this is my daughter, Kat.

214
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:14,681
His close personal daughter.

215
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,511
How nice to meet you, Kat.

216
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,346
Very nice to meet you.

217
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,098
You have a beautiful daughter.

218
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,391
Very beautiful.

219
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:24,894
We are very happy that you could
come all the way to Whipstaff.

220
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,187
Very happy.

221
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,860
The both of us.

222
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,368
You're kind of hurting my face.

223
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:34,529
Sorry. Now, Dr. Harvey

224
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,866
exactly what kind of time
frame are you looking at?

225
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:42,537
Please tell me you'll just go in
the house and spray and that's it.

226
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:46,124
No. As with a traditional
psychological cure

227
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,834
it can take weeks or even years...

228
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,544
Excuse me!

229
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,755
Did you just say the word "years"?

230
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,131
It's conceivable.

231
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,801
No, it isn't. Days is conceivable.

232
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,011
Weeks, maybe.

233
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:59,554
Possibly.

234
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:03,224
Months, no. Years, forget it.

235
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,944
- Forget it.
- Dibs, check.

236
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,732
Get the bouquet. Now, Dr. Harvey

237
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,239
I will be watching
you very closely.

238
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,656
These are for you.

239
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:20,250
Have a lovely night.

240
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,067
Wow.

241
00:19:56,445 --> 00:20:00,290
It's her. She's here. She's
in my house. I did it!

242
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,785
What if she likes me?
What if she doesn't?

243
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:07,460
"Hi, I'm Casper. I'm a ghost."

244
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,296
No, that's total disaster.

245
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,805
"Yo, I'm Casper.
What's up? Give me four."

246
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,221
God, I'd kill for a pinkie.

247
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,935
See? That was easy.

248
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,353
Yeah.

249
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,730
Pennies should hold for now

250
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:35,155
but we ought to get a box
of 20 amps in the morning.

251
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,993
Right, yeah, 20s should be fine.

252
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:44,492
All right, I'm gonna
go find a room, Dad.

253
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,036
You gonna be all right alone?

254
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:50,837
If I'm not back in 10 days,
send a search party.

255
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,170
"Stretch"

256
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:37,008
"Fatso"

257
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:40,553
and "Stinkie"?

258
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:46,472
Man, they had cruel parents.
I wonder where Doc and Dopey sleep.

259
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,966
Dad, I found my room!

260
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:23,258
There's a girl on my bed.

261
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,884
Yes!

262
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,776
Space master! In here.

263
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,398
It's very scary.

264
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:40,441
Have you seen any surprises yet?

265
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,536
Please. This is the
deadest place yet.

266
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,447
This is a nice room.

267
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:49,952
Right. This place is
a freak's holiday.

268
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,847
Mom belongs over here.

269
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:08,220
How about if I help you unpack?

270
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:15,569
Why bother? We'll just be repacking
in two weeks anyway, right?

271
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,407
I'm kidding.

272
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:23,611
This place is fine.

273
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:28,369
Good.

274
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,451
Night, bucket.

275
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:33,420
Night, Dad.

276
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,877
We're gonna be glad we came.

277
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:42,846
You watch.

278
00:24:58,372 --> 00:24:59,964
Hi.

279
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,252
Man!

280
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,173
Perfect first impression.
What a jerk!

281
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:23,314
Better?

282
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:26,866
Honey!

283
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:29,861
Honey, what?

284
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,988
Dad, I saw a ghost!

285
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:35,074
- It was a real, live ghost!
- Slow down. What are you saying?

286
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,951
I saw a ghost.

287
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:40,830
And it had a head, it was round, it
was white and see-through, and...

288
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:41,914
Wait a minute. Now maybe...

289
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,249
Dad, please.

290
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,544
Do not think I'm as crazy as I
thought you were. I promise.

291
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:50,256
No, but remember, ghosts
can't hurt you, okay?

292
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:53,384
They're simply spirits with
unfinished business, all right?

293
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,429
Let's just see about
this ghost, all right?

294
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:00,275
Come here. Come on.
Over here. Check here.

295
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,478
See? No ghost there.

296
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:06,607
And then we can check
over here, all right?

297
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:13,447
No, there's no ghost in there.
We can even check over here.

298
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,664
There. See?

299
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,667
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

300
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:31,089
Dad, put me down!

301
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,968
This is insane. What are you doing?

302
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,219
I can walk, you know.

303
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,402
My God, this is big.

304
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:46,437
- Dad?
- What?

305
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,690
We're in a closet.

306
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:55,410
Right. Now I want you to stay in
here no matter what you hear, okay?

307
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:57,282
Okay.

308
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:59,075
- Wait!
- What?

309
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:01,169
Dad, I'm sorry.

310
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,079
For what?

311
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:07,426
For not believing you. For
thinking you were a total loser.

312
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,754
Apologize later.

313
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,506
Blew it!

314
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:16,926
Uh-oh.

315
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:18,761
It's them.

316
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:21,347
- Giddyup there!
- Go, horsie!

317
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:28,938
Man oh, man, them ponies run
faster when we go down to Belmont.

318
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:30,986
Here, Flicka.

319
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,527
Hey, guys. Have fun?

320
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:37,530
Look, it's Casper!

321
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:42,326
Now on a scale of 1 to 10,
10 being fun and 1 being you

322
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,579
yeah, we had fun.

323
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,540
Giddyup there.

324
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:50,710
Say, Bulbhead, why ain't you
inside doing your chores?

325
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:54,839
Yeah, where's dinner? I'm starving.
Look at me, I'm wasting away here.

326
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:59,302
I know. How about you guys relax out
here and tonight we'll eat alfresco?

327
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:01,387
Sounds great. Who's that?

328
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:05,141
Short-sheet, you wouldn't be trying to
keep us out of the house, would you?

329
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:06,309
No!

330
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:09,729
I can see right through that
bulbous little head of yours.

331
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,480
It's just such a lovely night.

332
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:14,775
I thought we'd have fun just
eating under the harvest moon.

333
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:20,031
<i>Shine on, shine on harvest moon</i>

334
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,699
<i>Up in the sky</i>

335
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,286
Bye-bye!

336
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,046
Hold it.

337
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,212
Fatso, you smell something?

338
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:35,379
Yeah.

339
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,302
No, besides him.

340
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,134
Hello?

341
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,896
No need to be afraid.

342
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:54,820
Yeah, right, don't be afraid.

343
00:28:56,485 --> 00:29:01,240
I'd like to make contact with you,
but just one little thing, please.

344
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:05,952
Don't pop out from under a rug or
through a keyhole. No spooking.

345
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:08,204
Let's get beyond that.

346
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:10,957
I would like to approach you.

347
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:13,756
Now I'm coming in the room.

348
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:18,257
I'm in the room.

349
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,968
Can you deal with that?

350
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:32,733
Dive!

351
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,907
Dad?

352
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:08,273
I'm gonna kill you, your mama

353
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:10,855
and all her bridge-playing friends.

354
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,186
You think you got it
tough? I got a facelift.

355
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,655
There was one just
like it underneath.

356
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:37,794
Dad?

357
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:42,340
Boys, we got a closet case here!

358
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,400
Smell-o-gram!

359
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:07,698
Sushi, anyone?

360
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,543
California roll coming up!

361
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:16,290
All for one and one for all!

362
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:19,335
Catch your pants before they fall!

363
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:22,838
On the runway, we have Dr. James
Harvey wearing smashing underwear.

364
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,882
Marky Mark he's not!

365
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,600
You are good.

366
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,851
Stop. It's you.

367
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,229
Are we scary or what?

368
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:46,201
And it looks as if we're gonna
go into sudden death overtime.

369
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,324
Anybody for a little shish ke-doc?

370
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,168
I am.

371
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:19,770
Who do you think you
are defiling our domicile?

372
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:24,275
Dr. James Harvey, your therapist.

373
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:25,777
Dad!

374
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:33,376
Are you okay?

375
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:44,295
Dad.

376
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,099
And he's down for the count.

377
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:01,070
A winner by a clean stink out!

378
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:03,606
Get back.

379
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:05,859
What the hell is that thing?

380
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,624
Not the nose!

381
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:17,245
I'm being hosed!

382
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,871
No!

383
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,759
This sucks.

384
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:30,137
Dad? Are you okay?

385
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,722
I'm fine. Why don't we go regroup?

386
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:39,517
- Get your hand out of my mouth!
- I found half a Twinkie!

387
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:40,976
- Who let one?
- Who do you think?

388
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,728
Who's got their
pointy head in my...

389
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:43,896
That's not my head.

390
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:47,742
You know, fellas, we're
never this close anymore.

391
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:34,572
Morning. No, please don't scream.
I promise, I won't hurt you.

392
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:37,241
I'm a ghost. Yes, I admit it,
but I'm a friendly ghost.

393
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:40,452
You have to trust me. If you
scream, you'll wake up my uncles

394
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:44,878
and they get awfully cranky. I'm
gonna let you go now. Okay?

395
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:49,503
You're so cold.

396
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:52,382
Yeah, but it saves in
the heating, though.

397
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:58,183
Come on.

398
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:01,725
It's okay.

399
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,144
I can see right through you.

400
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:08,899
It kind of happens when
you don't have any skin.

401
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:14,779
What are you made of?

402
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:18,407
You know that tingling feeling
when your foot falls asleep?

403
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:20,159
I think I'm made of that.

404
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,557
Sunny-side up kind of makes me yak.

405
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,480
No problem.

406
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:08,708
So, can you go invisible?

407
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,715
That one's easy.

408
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,345
It's fresh.

409
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,347
Go ahead.

410
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:25,725
I've never done this before.

411
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,978
Me, neither.

412
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,984
- Can you hurt me?
- No.

413
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:32,314
Can I hurt you?

414
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,941
No.

415
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,421
Cool.

416
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:58,801
Morning, Dr. Harvey.
Some breakfast?

417
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,646
You okay?

418
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,319
Good.

419
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:24,208
How about a paper? <i>The New York
Times? The Journal? Hong Kong Press?</i>

420
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:26,957
- Sure.
- Coming at you.

421
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:39,845
Hope you're hungry.

422
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,290
I love the smell of
fleshies in the morning.

423
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,968
I'm melting.

424
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,130
Auntie Phlegm.

425
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:22,554
What a world!

426
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,532
- They're gone.
- What happened?

427
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,324
They must have crossed over.

428
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,953
Don't think so!

429
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:53,330
Guess again, Bonebag!

430
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:57,965
Fellas. Good morning.

431
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:00,304
Casper.

432
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:06,134
How dare you serve these
air-sucking intruders before us.

433
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:07,678
I was just...

434
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,398
Give me my

435
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:13,359
meal!

436
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,193
Okay.

437
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,988
I feel like Oprah on hiatus.

438
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:28,833
You look like Oprah on hiatus.

439
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:33,584
Ketchup, please.

440
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,333
You know what the problem is?

441
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:41,086
Casper's got no respect for us.

442
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:44,841
After all we've done for
the little glowworm.

443
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:47,843
What the hell do you think
you're doing, Bulbhead?

444
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:50,846
This floor used to be dirty
enough to eat off of.

445
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:52,139
But we have company.

446
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,985
Yeah? Company loves misery.

447
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:02,274
You guys are disgusting,
obnoxious creeps.

448
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:03,400
Thank you.

449
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,610
I mean, what's your problem?

450
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:06,153
He's just cleaning the floor.

451
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:08,238
Shut up, Skinbag.

452
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,948
- Piss off.
- Take a hike.

453
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,283
- Get a grave.
- Honey!

454
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:14,411
...school thing and you
don't want to be late...

455
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,996
- Drop dead!
- Too late!

456
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:20,752
You go have a lot of fun.
I know you will.

457
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:31,187
All right, guys, we've obviously
gotten off on the wrong foot here.

458
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:36,475
Now, you know and I know that
you really shouldn't be here.

459
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:38,477
So I'll tell you what.

460
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:41,355
Why don't you go ahead
and finish your meal

461
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:43,357
and we can meet in my office

462
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:46,828
and start the process
of crossing over.

463
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,701
What do you say?

464
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:57,000
It's your hour.

465
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:04,345
Watch it!

466
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,177
Amber, wait up!

467
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,457
Had that locker last year.

468
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,505
Thanks.

469
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,589
My name's Vic.

470
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,721
Kat.

471
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,601
Coming, Vic?

472
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,269
Okay, gang, let's settle down!

473
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,443
Put a lid on it!

474
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,525
I got a couple of
announcements to make.

475
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:14,573
First. The asbestos removal from the gym
is taking a little longer than planned.

476
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:18,618
So we're gonna have to push
back the Halloween Dance

477
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:19,995
just by a couple of months.

478
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:28,378
As most of you know, my parents
have finished the new boathouse.

479
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:32,804
So I'm sure it'd be no problem
having the party at my place.

480
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,969
Great. That's done.

481
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,638
Secondly, we have a
new student today.

482
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:42,268
I'd like you all to
meet Harvey Kathleen.

483
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:48,654
Would you like to come up and
say hi to everyone for me?

484
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:08,627
Why don't you tell us something
special about yourself, Kathleen?

485
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:10,462
It's Kat.

486
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:18,345
I guess I just moved here
with my dad from Santa Fe

487
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:20,514
and Friendship seems like

488
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:24,184
a pretty friendly place.

489
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,980
So where are you guys living?

490
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:31,108
In outer space?

491
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,329
No. Whipstaff.

492
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,201
You've heard of it.

493
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:43,286
You actually live there?

494
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,205
Yeah, I mean...

495
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:49,167
I know it looks kind of funky and
stuff from the outside and everything

496
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:53,718
but, I mean... I don't know,
inside it's kind of cool.

497
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:56,554
Yeah, if you drink blood.

498
00:43:57,426 --> 00:44:01,721
Mr. Curtis, check this. We're dead
for the Halloween Dance, right?

499
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:06,272
This girl has a seriously creepy
house with room to spare.

500
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:10,899
Wait a minute. I thought we were
having the party at my place.

501
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,525
Okay, we'll take a vote.

502
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:17,530
Whoever wants the party at
my house, raise your hand.

503
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,240
Whipstaff?

504
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:30,876
"Johns Hopkins University."
Very impressive.

505
00:44:30,877 --> 00:44:32,799
- Very.
- Pull!

506
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,938
Not this one.

507
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:45,974
Thank you, gentlemen.

508
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:47,309
What a dish, Doc.

509
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:49,769
The little missus, perhaps?

510
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:54,274
Fatso, you animal!
Is she available, Doc?

511
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:57,068
She's my wife, Amelia.
She's deceased.

512
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:58,153
Even better.

513
00:44:58,154 --> 00:45:01,489
But we're not here
to talk about me.

514
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:04,492
See? Now don't you feel just awful?

515
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:05,702
I was just goofing.

516
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,662
Don't be goofing on Amelia.

517
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:13,251
She's as nice a person as they come.
She's always treated you right, Stinkie.

518
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:16,296
I got no complaints. She's
always been an angel to me.

519
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:19,633
Wait a minute. What are you saying?

520
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:23,809
I'm saying she's a peach.
None better. Why?

521
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,388
You've actually seen her?

522
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,765
What, you think I'm blind?

523
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:29,434
Of course, I've seen her.
Who hasn't?

524
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:32,979
What, you're not looking
for her, are you, Doc?

525
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,524
That's not really the focus
of our sessions here, is it?

526
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:39,778
But as long as you raise the issue

527
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:46,126
you wouldn't have a way of
contacting others like yourselves

528
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:48,291
would you?

529
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:51,665
I didn't think so.

530
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:55,293
Now that's not generally
allowed there, Doc.

531
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:58,171
I mean, you got to
go through channels.

532
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,506
Yeah, paperwork.

533
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:03,301
- Red tape.
- A holy mess, you know what I'm saying?

534
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:08,014
But for you, I don't know, maybe
we could work something out.

535
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:12,018
You keep that ghoul
Crittenden off our backs

536
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:16,022
and I'd say we got
a deal. Right, boys?

537
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:19,609
Deal?

538
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,069
Deal.

539
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:24,540
Fatso, you know where
Amelia floats. Go.

540
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:28,201
It's that easy, huh?

541
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:30,245
We got a ghost-to-ghost network.

542
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:31,746
We share haunting stories.

543
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:33,123
We throw parties.

544
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:36,377
The parties are always
pretty dead, though.

545
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:42,553
That was fast.

546
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,770
I think it's for you, Doc.

547
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:00,363
Go.

548
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,852
Amelia?

549
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:32,440
My man!

550
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:47,156
What are you doing... I mean, hi.

551
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:50,451
Can I come in?

552
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:54,621
No. It's so much

553
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:58,843
nicer out here in
the flesh... Fresh air.

554
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:03,092
So did you ask your
dad about the party?

555
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,883
Yeah.

556
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:10,470
He kind of hit the ceiling, but
I think it's gonna be okay.

557
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:13,144
Cool. So listen

558
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:16,935
if you're not hooked up with anybody
else, you wanna... I don't know

559
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:20,315
you wanna hang out
with me at the party?

560
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:23,024
I'd love to.

561
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:25,152
All right. Cool.

562
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,112
All right, see you.

563
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:28,660
Okay.

564
00:48:41,795 --> 00:48:45,046
- Well, did you ask her?
- Yeah.

565
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:47,891
And she actually believed you.

566
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:50,176
This really bites.

567
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:53,556
No, it's absolutely perfect.

568
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,863
See? I'm a good dancer.

569
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:19,414
I don't need a costume.

570
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:24,169
I'm always the life of the party.

571
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:27,547
Casper! Listen,
I know you want to go.

572
00:49:27,548 --> 00:49:29,757
Come on, we'd have a
great time together.

573
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:32,051
Casper, I have a date.

574
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,929
What's this Vic guy
got that I don't?

575
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,264
A pulse.

576
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:38,859
Big fleshy deal.

577
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:40,435
A tan.

578
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:42,734
Very bad for your skin.

579
00:49:43,856 --> 00:49:46,358
How about a reflection?

580
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:53,915
Okay, but can he do this?

581
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:59,955
Come with me if you want to live.

582
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:05,093
Casper, no. Don't!

583
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:16,727
Casper, no. Oh, my God.
High, this is very high!

584
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,558
Casper!

585
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:34,198
Casper, this is beautiful.

586
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:36,032
I come here every night.

587
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:38,080
Alone?

588
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:44,465
What were you like
when you were alive?

589
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:47,219
I was...

590
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,382
I don't remember.

591
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:56,928
You don't remember
anything from your life?

592
00:50:56,929 --> 00:50:58,346
No.

593
00:50:58,347 --> 00:51:00,645
So, nothing?

594
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,979
You don't remember what
school you went to?

595
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:09,654
How old you were?
Your favorite song?

596
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:13,077
What about your dad?

597
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,666
Not even your mom?

598
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:21,160
Is that bad?

599
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:25,131
No. It's just kind of sad.

600
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:37,015
I wonder why you don't
remember anything.

601
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,933
Guess 'cause when you're a ghost

602
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:46,185
life doesn't matter
that much anymore.

603
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:48,188
So you forget.

604
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:53,326
Sometimes I worry that
I'm starting to forget.

605
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:55,653
Forget what?

606
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:57,622
My mom.

607
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:01,167
Just certain things.

608
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:05,710
The sound of her making
breakfast downstairs.

609
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:10,468
The way she put on her
lipstick, so carefully.

610
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,215
I do remember.

611
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:18,217
She always used Ivory soap.

612
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:23,019
And when she'd hug me,
I'd breathe her in so deep

613
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:27,854
and I remember, before
I'd go to sleep

614
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:30,396
she'd whisper in my ear,

615
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:34,651
"Stardust in the eyes, rosy cheeks,

616
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:37,701
"and a happy girl in the morning."

617
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:51,259
If my mom's a ghost, did
she forget about me?

618
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:55,505
No. She'd never forget you.

619
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,605
If I were alive

620
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:07,518
would you go to the
Halloween Dance with me?

621
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:13,398
Can I keep you?

622
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:22,457
Casper, close the
window. It's cold.

623
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,650
Hey, Dad.

624
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:52,478
I found your Visa card.

625
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,231
Where was it?

626
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:57,150
In your wallet. I was thinking,
maybe I could use it

627
00:53:57,151 --> 00:53:59,944
to buy this perfect costume
I saw in a store downtown.

628
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:01,404
You always made your costume.

629
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:03,498
No, Mom did.

630
00:54:05,284 --> 00:54:07,994
I think I could come up
with something pretty good.

631
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:13,217
Why don't we just roll you in aluminum
foil and you could go as a leftover?

632
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:20,047
Don't worry. You always look cute.

633
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:23,384
I don't wanna look cute. Cute's
like when you're nine years old

634
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:27,014
and you've got papier-mâché
around your head.

635
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:29,228
I wanna look

636
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,231
nice.

637
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:36,982
Like date nice.

638
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:40,823
Really?

639
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:48,995
Honey, you know, I think maybe
it's time that we sat down...

640
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:50,953
It's a little late for that, Dad.

641
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,706
How late?

642
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,709
Don't worry, not that late.

643
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,587
Good.

644
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:04,175
You know that I would love to buy
you everything that you wanted

645
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:08,897
but until Miss Crittenden pays me,
that thing is pretty worthless.

646
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,266
That's okay. Don't worry about it.

647
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:15,561
I'm sure I can come up with
something perfect for the party.

648
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:19,106
<i>It's my party, and
I'll die if I want to</i>

649
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:21,025
<i>Die if I want to</i>

650
00:55:22,778 --> 00:55:25,404
Dad, please.

651
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:29,079
Whatever you do, don't
let those guys crash it.

652
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:34,247
I think they're actually getting
to be quite focused now.

653
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:40,804
<i>You will die, too,
when it happens to you</i>

654
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,558
Big finish.

655
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:48,766
Scream or sugar?

656
00:57:09,343 --> 00:57:12,011
The patient has finally arrived.

657
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:13,679
Late again, I see.

658
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:17,309
Could this be an expression
of hostility, Doc?

659
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:21,153
It's your hour, Freud.

660
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:28,529
What, so silent? No pearls
of wisdom today, Doc?

661
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:32,536
Come on, Doc. Stay
tough, don't stop.

662
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:38,162
Come on, Doc, hang with us
homeboys. Wait a second.

663
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:41,874
What? You ain't thinking about
packing it in now, are you, Doc?

664
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,709
We're just starting to have fun.

665
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:47,680
It ain't often we meet a
bonebag as amusing as you.

666
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:50,841
Boys, this is serious.

667
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:54,387
I think the doc is having one
of them fleshy breakdowns.

668
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:55,930
Time for drastic measures.

669
00:57:55,931 --> 00:57:57,390
You think we should sing a song?

670
00:57:57,391 --> 00:58:01,852
No. I think it's time we gave
the doc our own prescription.

671
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:03,104
But what about the party?

672
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:05,064
The party'll have to wait.

673
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:07,525
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

674
00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:08,609
Gentlemen.

675
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:11,283
- Happy hour.
- Happy hour.

676
00:58:14,074 --> 00:58:18,035
<i>Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the
wall, ninety-nine bottles of beer</i>

677
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:19,745
Here's to dead guys!

678
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:22,415
This is an outrage.
This is appalling.

679
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:25,626
You pay a man to get ghosts out
of the house and what does he do?

680
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:27,169
He gets the ghosts
out of the house.

681
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,263
Exactly.

682
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:43,144
It's about time.

683
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:55,786
Look familiar?

684
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:10,675
I know this!

685
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:19,805
I had five fingers. I remember.

686
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:23,192
Hootie!

687
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:30,696
And wait!

688
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:40,493
Check it out.

689
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:42,541
Hands up, Kat!

690
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:54,845
It was my mom's.

691
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,052
Can I?

692
00:59:58,053 --> 00:59:59,679
Go ahead.

693
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:17,322
It's perfect. Do you think I could
wear it to the party tonight?

694
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,583
Casper?

695
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,714
I begged and begged my
dad to get me this sled.

696
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:35,390
He acted like I couldn't even have it
'cause I didn't know how to ride it.

697
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:41,053
Then one morning I came down for
breakfast and there it was, just for me.

698
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:43,431
For no reason at all.

699
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:48,194
I took it out and went
sledding all day.

700
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:53,946
My dad said that's enough but I couldn't
stop. I was having so much fun.

701
01:00:54,693 --> 01:00:58,072
Then it got late, it got dark.

702
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:00,907
It got cold

703
01:01:02,117 --> 01:01:04,290
and I got sick.

704
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:06,917
My dad got sad.

705
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:16,430
What's it like to die?

706
01:01:17,716 --> 01:01:20,765
Like being born.

707
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:23,763
Only backwards.

708
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:28,276
I remember, I didn't go
where I was supposed to go.

709
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:30,936
I just stayed behind

710
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:33,781
so my dad wouldn't be lonely.

711
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:49,459
Is that your dad?

712
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:57,296
"McFadden claimed that he was
haunted by the ghost of his dead son

713
01:01:57,297 --> 01:02:00,466
"and that he invented a machine
to bring him back to life...

714
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:02,469
"The Lazarus."

715
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:15,652
Sorry. I guess we'll have
to take the long way.

716
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:18,159
Hurry up! Come on!

717
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:23,072
My dad hid it so no
one could find it.

718
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:26,497
But I remember where it is!
Wait till you see it.

719
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:39,338
Don't you know a shortcut?

720
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:41,341
You got it.

721
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:44,093
Casper, no.

722
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:47,473
Wall! Human! Stop!

723
01:02:53,812 --> 01:02:55,939
Hey, over here.

724
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:59,033
Go ahead. Sit down.

725
01:03:00,819 --> 01:03:03,037
I would hold on.

726
01:03:03,363 --> 01:03:05,035
Why?

727
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:20,046
Casper!

728
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:54,891
Well?

729
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:56,475
What was that?

730
01:04:56,476 --> 01:04:58,310
The "Up and At 'Em Machine."

731
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:00,270
My dad was a great inventor

732
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:02,606
but he had trouble getting
going in the morning.

733
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:05,576
Didn't he ever hear of caffeine?

734
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:27,348
What is all this?

735
01:05:27,507 --> 01:05:28,632
My dad's lab.

736
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:30,259
Kind of a slob, wasn't he?

737
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:33,971
Here, he could do whatever he
wanted to. No matter how busy he was

738
01:05:33,972 --> 01:05:36,849
he would drop everything
to play pirates with me.

739
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:39,478
Man, we had so much fun!

740
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:42,187
Aye, matey. Buccaneers
and buried gold.

741
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:45,111
Whipstaff doth a treasure hold.

742
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:47,360
Come on.

743
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,698
So where's this Lazarus thing?

744
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:54,450
You're looking at it.

745
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:56,203
Down there?

746
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:58,036
That's useful.

747
01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:00,122
I know there's a way
to get it going.

748
01:06:00,123 --> 01:06:01,540
I just can't...

749
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:03,292
What about that?

750
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:04,376
That?

751
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:06,879
That's the vault.

752
01:06:09,716 --> 01:06:11,925
Wait! It's got to be this!

753
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:20,206
Hey, I did it!

754
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,483
Lazarus.

755
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:14,464
- What is this?
- Careful!

756
01:08:14,465 --> 01:08:16,967
That's what makes the
whole thing work.

757
01:08:16,968 --> 01:08:20,221
Kind of an instant
primordial soup mix.

758
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:24,024
It's what brings
ghosts back to life.

759
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:26,902
Just enough for one.

760
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:41,783
Pull the lever.

761
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:43,035
Which one?

762
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:45,504
I don't know. Try one.

763
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:57,891
Casper.

764
01:08:58,051 --> 01:09:00,394
I'm gonna be alive.

765
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:12,522
How am I gonna do this?

766
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:16,118
I couldn't even get my
Easy Bake oven to work.

767
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:55,945
Casper?

768
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:11,924
Am I alive?

769
01:10:15,128 --> 01:10:17,295
Do you have any idea
what this means?

770
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:18,968
Yes!

771
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:20,590
No.

772
01:10:20,591 --> 01:10:22,968
You don't have to be
scared of death anymore.

773
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:25,804
One minute you're a ghost
next you're back on your feet

774
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:27,681
free to come and go as you please.

775
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:31,527
- Hell, you could even fly through...
- Walls!

776
01:10:33,146 --> 01:10:34,604
Thick walls.

777
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:36,698
Thick as steel.

778
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:39,818
Certainly could get to
whatever's behind those walls.

779
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:41,987
Like a treasure, for example?

780
01:10:41,988 --> 01:10:46,618
Then snap, crackle, pop, you're back
alive and on your way to the Riviera.

781
01:10:46,993 --> 01:10:49,336
If you were a ghost.

782
01:10:49,996 --> 01:10:51,998
If you were.

783
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:58,003
Damn it, Dibs.
This won't hurt a bit.

784
01:10:58,004 --> 01:11:00,213
Stop being such a weenie!

785
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:03,008
It's just business. Come on!

786
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:05,386
If you would just...

787
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:21,910
So there you are.

788
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:39,045
Dibs, you're taking this
way too personally.

789
01:11:47,762 --> 01:11:49,354
Wait!

790
01:11:57,897 --> 01:12:00,570
Carrigan?

791
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:05,071
Are you a ghost yet?

792
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:09,575
Carrigan!

793
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:14,288
What a tragic waste.

794
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:17,299
She had my favorite sunglasses.

795
01:12:19,418 --> 01:12:22,462
Not so fast, little man.

796
01:12:22,463 --> 01:12:25,091
The bitch is back.

797
01:12:31,806 --> 01:12:34,933
<i>Warden threw a party
at the county jail</i>

798
01:12:34,934 --> 01:12:37,769
<i>The prison band was there
and they began to wail</i>

799
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:40,647
<i>The band was playin' hard
the joint began to swing</i>

800
01:12:40,648 --> 01:12:43,108
<i>You shoulda heard those
knocked out jailbirds sing</i>

<i>Let's rock</i>

802
01:12:44,485 --> 01:12:48,613
This Dr. Harvey's got a lot of
spirit, you know what I'm saying?

803
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:52,242
Yeah, but he's got his whole
miserable life ahead of him.

804
01:12:52,243 --> 01:12:55,954
So we could do him a favor
and put him out of his misery.

805
01:12:55,955 --> 01:12:58,415
Yeah. Good idea.

806
01:12:58,416 --> 01:13:01,626
We've been the ghostly
trio long enough.

807
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:05,973
Time to make it a quartet.

808
01:13:17,184 --> 01:13:19,853
Can I just say something here?

809
01:13:19,854 --> 01:13:21,313
Get a little personal?

810
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:23,857
Yeah. Why not?

811
01:13:23,858 --> 01:13:25,025
Well, you know.

812
01:13:25,026 --> 01:13:28,370
I just got to tell you

813
01:13:28,863 --> 01:13:32,032
you guys remind me
of what it's like

814
01:13:32,033 --> 01:13:33,825
to hang out with the boys.

815
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:35,201
I mean

816
01:13:35,202 --> 01:13:39,957
you are absolutely
there for each other.

817
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,834
I mean

818
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:44,836
you look like right in the face.

819
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:48,181
You say, "I'm a ghost.
I don't need you."

820
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:50,008
You know what?

821
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:53,513
I'm gonna tell that
Miss Critten Picken...

822
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:56,019
Crichton Critten.

823
01:13:56,682 --> 01:13:59,517
I'm gonna tell that lady

824
01:13:59,518 --> 01:14:01,645
you ain't going anywhere.

825
01:14:01,646 --> 01:14:04,856
It's your house.
You're haunting it.

826
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:07,317
Possession is nine-tenths
of the law...

827
01:14:07,318 --> 01:14:08,985
- No.
- Yes.

828
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:10,111
No.

829
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:11,704
Yes.

830
01:14:13,074 --> 01:14:17,545
I didn't think so at first
but you guys are great.

831
01:14:19,372 --> 01:14:21,374
I love you.

832
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:33,227
No.

833
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:47,237
What a sweetheart.

834
01:14:47,274 --> 01:14:49,776
I can't croak him now.

835
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:53,451
Me, neither. No way.

836
01:14:57,076 --> 01:14:59,123
All right, boys.

837
01:14:59,578 --> 01:15:01,921
The night is young.

838
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:04,416
We are going to clean out

839
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:07,215
every bar this town has got!

840
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:11,131
We're gonna booze
it until we lose it.

841
01:15:11,132 --> 01:15:13,259
Come on.

842
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:29,107
I think my ears just popped.

843
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:37,286
Come to mama!

844
01:15:41,287 --> 01:15:42,579
My treasure!

845
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:44,957
You mean my treasure.

846
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:47,459
Miss Crittenden?

847
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:48,626
In the flesh.

848
01:15:48,627 --> 01:15:50,795
Well, in a couple of minutes.

849
01:15:55,634 --> 01:15:57,635
Dibs! What are you doing?

850
01:15:57,636 --> 01:15:59,137
This is no time to shave!

851
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:01,181
Helping you. Remember?

852
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:02,974
Remember what?

853
01:16:02,975 --> 01:16:04,476
This!

854
01:16:04,477 --> 01:16:07,150
You stole that. That's Casper's.

855
01:16:08,147 --> 01:16:09,773
So sue me!

856
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:11,983
Dibs! The capsule, now!

857
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:14,612
Coming. I'm coming, okay?

858
01:16:19,033 --> 01:16:21,001
Keep away from me!

859
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:28,716
Here!

860
01:16:28,959 --> 01:16:30,802
Jump in!

861
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:55,202
Perfect.

862
01:16:59,532 --> 01:17:01,534
We're here.

863
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:03,868
Okay.

864
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:05,745
Hi. Come on in.

865
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:07,205
This is the room.

866
01:17:07,206 --> 01:17:11,381
Stay together, you'll be safe,
and I'll be right back.

867
01:17:17,383 --> 01:17:20,181
Amber, do we have to do this?

868
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:22,595
She wants a Halloween party.

869
01:17:22,596 --> 01:17:25,724
She's gonna get a Halloween party.

870
01:17:39,363 --> 01:17:40,780
That's my treasure!

871
01:17:40,781 --> 01:17:44,075
- Stay back! Keep away from me!
- Casper.

872
01:17:44,076 --> 01:17:46,578
Don't come near me,
you spiteful spook.

873
01:17:46,579 --> 01:17:48,746
I'll knock you into the next world!

874
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:51,249
Come on. Let's go.

875
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:06,264
Hey, Poppin Fresh.
It's my turn in the oven!

876
01:18:06,265 --> 01:18:10,602
Dibs! Get this thing cooking,
you flaccid little worm, you!

877
01:18:14,982 --> 01:18:17,735
How kind of you to drop in.

878
01:18:17,818 --> 01:18:20,778
You know, if there's one
thing I've learned from you

879
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:23,781
it's always kick them
when they're down.

880
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:27,252
And, baby, you're six feet under.

881
01:18:27,411 --> 01:18:29,629
Oh, what a shame.

882
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:33,458
Sorry, sweetheart.

883
01:18:33,459 --> 01:18:35,084
We're through.

884
01:18:35,085 --> 01:18:39,306
I am not gonna forget this, you
ungrateful lousy little worm, you!

885
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:42,300
You can haunt me all you want

886
01:18:42,301 --> 01:18:46,012
but it's gonna be in a
great, big, expensive house

887
01:18:46,013 --> 01:18:51,142
with lovely purple wallpaper
and great big green carpets.

888
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:54,145
And a little dog called Carrigan.

889
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:57,357
A bitch, just like you!

890
01:18:57,358 --> 01:19:00,443
I got the power!
I got the treasure!

891
01:19:00,444 --> 01:19:02,992
And you have a flight to catch.

892
01:19:07,451 --> 01:19:09,669
Any other takers?

893
01:19:09,787 --> 01:19:12,830
No. But aren't you
forgetting something?

894
01:19:12,831 --> 01:19:14,503
What?

895
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:17,001
Your unfinished business.

896
01:19:17,002 --> 01:19:18,878
My what?

897
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:20,338
You know

898
01:19:20,339 --> 01:19:22,340
unfinished business.

899
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:25,051
All ghosts have
unfinished business.

900
01:19:25,052 --> 01:19:26,970
That's why they don't cross over.

901
01:19:26,971 --> 01:19:31,015
Unfinished business? I have
no unfinished business.

902
01:19:31,016 --> 01:19:33,309
I have my treasure, my mansion.

903
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:35,186
I have everything!

904
01:19:35,187 --> 01:19:37,735
I'm just perfect!

905
01:19:39,817 --> 01:19:42,068
Wait, I lied!

906
01:19:42,069 --> 01:19:44,904
I have unfinished business.
Lots of unfinished business.

907
01:19:44,905 --> 01:19:47,407
I'm not ready to cross over yet!

908
01:19:47,408 --> 01:19:50,868
Wait! You tricked me,
you rotten little brats!

909
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:52,871
No!

910
01:20:13,392 --> 01:20:14,600
My treasure!

911
01:20:14,601 --> 01:20:17,695
A ball? That's your treasure?

912
01:20:18,188 --> 01:20:19,272
Are you kidding?

913
01:20:19,273 --> 01:20:22,233
It's autographed by Duke Snider
of the Brooklyn Dodgers.

914
01:20:22,234 --> 01:20:24,361
My favorite player.

915
01:20:24,445 --> 01:20:26,279
Casper

916
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:28,248
it's time.

917
01:20:33,746 --> 01:20:37,125
Honey, I'm home!

918
01:20:43,297 --> 01:20:44,969
Dad?

919
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:47,884
No. What have you done to him?

920
01:20:47,885 --> 01:20:50,636
Nothing. He's just a little dead.

921
01:20:50,637 --> 01:20:52,055
I'm free!

922
01:20:52,056 --> 01:20:54,098
I've never felt so good in my life!

923
01:20:54,099 --> 01:20:56,772
I can fly!

924
01:20:57,811 --> 01:20:58,936
Rookie.

925
01:20:58,937 --> 01:21:00,780
Stinkie, work with him.

926
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:03,446
Dad?

927
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:05,735
Who's the girl?

928
01:21:05,736 --> 01:21:08,659
Dad, it's me. It's Kat!

929
01:21:08,781 --> 01:21:10,453
Kat?

930
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:12,408
Kat Ballou?

931
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:13,493
Katatonic?

932
01:21:13,494 --> 01:21:14,786
Katastrophic?

933
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:16,630
Kreplach soup?

934
01:21:22,169 --> 01:21:24,467
Flash flood alert.

935
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:28,466
Don't you remember?

936
01:21:31,637 --> 01:21:35,061
Yeah, I remember!

937
01:21:39,812 --> 01:21:42,030
No, this.

938
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:51,364
Kat.

939
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:54,660
Sweetheart.

940
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,537
What have I done?

941
01:21:57,871 --> 01:22:00,669
Kat, don't cry.

942
01:22:01,375 --> 01:22:03,172
Please.

943
01:22:03,544 --> 01:22:07,389
Come on, Dr. Harvey. You
need this more than I do.

944
01:22:10,509 --> 01:22:12,352
Casper.

945
01:22:12,845 --> 01:22:15,393
This is the way it's got to be.

946
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:45,631
Dad?

947
01:22:55,596 --> 01:22:57,598
Honey.

948
01:22:58,724 --> 01:23:02,068
It felt like the strangest dream.

949
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:09,739
I thought we almost lost each
other for a minute there.

950
01:23:13,572 --> 01:23:15,574
Oh, bucket.

951
01:23:21,455 --> 01:23:24,583
Your party started without you.

952
01:23:27,252 --> 01:23:30,096
Your date's probably waiting.

953
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:32,928
Maybe we should get going.

954
01:23:37,638 --> 01:23:39,685
Where are we?

955
01:23:58,158 --> 01:23:59,867
Well, go ahead.

956
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:01,665
What about you?

957
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:05,123
This is your party.
Go do your thing.

958
01:24:05,332 --> 01:24:06,791
Go hang

959
01:24:06,792 --> 01:24:08,209
or chill

960
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:11,008
or kick it, or
whatever you call it.

961
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:15,383
I think you got a date out there.

962
01:24:15,384 --> 01:24:17,010
Thanks, Dad.

963
01:24:22,558 --> 01:24:25,026
I hope no one saw that.

964
01:24:33,819 --> 01:24:35,236
Hold still.

965
01:24:35,237 --> 01:24:37,029
I'm trying. Could
you weigh any more?

966
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:39,828
Just shut up and get
your head down.

967
01:24:42,744 --> 01:24:45,162
You got to see this.

968
01:24:45,163 --> 01:24:47,582
People are gonna freak.

969
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:49,551
Let me see.

970
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,170
Cool.

971
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:55,093
Thank you.

972
01:26:10,832 --> 01:26:12,124
You're...

973
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:14,172
That's right.

974
01:26:15,087 --> 01:26:16,964
Kat's mom?

975
01:26:17,339 --> 01:26:19,841
Are you an angel?

976
01:26:20,759 --> 01:26:24,512
That was a very noble thing
you did tonight, Casper.

977
01:26:24,513 --> 01:26:27,098
I know Kat will never forget it.

978
01:26:27,099 --> 01:26:29,350
She needs her father.

979
01:26:29,351 --> 01:26:32,728
And I know yours will
never forget it either.

980
01:26:32,729 --> 01:26:35,564
You've fulfilled his
greatest dream, Casper

981
01:26:35,565 --> 01:26:39,035
and I know he is very proud of you.

982
01:26:39,236 --> 01:26:41,404
And for what you've done

983
01:26:41,405 --> 01:26:44,749
I'm giving you your
dream in return.

984
01:26:45,117 --> 01:26:47,995
But it's just for tonight.

985
01:26:48,537 --> 01:26:50,830
Sort of a Cinderella deal.

986
01:26:50,831 --> 01:26:52,748
So I have until midnight?

987
01:26:52,749 --> 01:26:54,125
Ten.

988
01:26:54,126 --> 01:26:57,254
Hey! Cinderella got until midnight.

989
01:26:57,671 --> 01:27:00,594
Cinderella wasn't 12 years old.

990
01:28:50,784 --> 01:28:53,707
I told you I was a good dancer.

991
01:28:54,496 --> 01:28:56,623
Can I keep you?

992
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:02,257
Casper?

993
01:29:44,296 --> 01:29:46,343
Hello, James.

994
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:51,723
Amelia.

995
01:29:53,096 --> 01:29:55,223
It's all right.

996
01:29:57,225 --> 01:29:59,272
It's just me.

997
01:30:04,566 --> 01:30:08,411
I thought I'd have a hundred
things to say when I...

998
01:30:11,156 --> 01:30:12,703
How?

999
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:18,038
Let's just say you know three
crazy ghosts who kept their word.

1000
01:30:20,498 --> 01:30:23,542
James, I know you've
been searching for me.

1001
01:30:23,543 --> 01:30:26,795
But there's something
you have to understand.

1002
01:30:26,796 --> 01:30:29,840
You and Kat loved me so
well when I was alive

1003
01:30:29,841 --> 01:30:32,551
that I have no unfinished business.

1004
01:30:32,552 --> 01:30:35,095
Please don't let me be yours.

1005
01:30:35,096 --> 01:30:37,189
But, Amelia

1006
01:30:39,809 --> 01:30:41,481
I don't...

1007
01:30:42,145 --> 01:30:45,114
I don't really know what I'm doing.

1008
01:30:46,399 --> 01:30:48,651
What parent does?

1009
01:30:49,277 --> 01:30:53,782
James, Kat is growing up
beautifully because of you.

1010
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:57,835
No wonder I miss you so much.

1011
01:30:59,663 --> 01:31:02,586
Just a couple of things, though.

1012
01:31:02,666 --> 01:31:06,636
Don't pick up the extension every
time she gets a phone call.

1013
01:31:06,795 --> 01:31:10,094
French fries are not
a breakfast food.

1014
01:31:10,423 --> 01:31:13,217
And don't ask her to
wear a T-shirt under...

1015
01:31:13,218 --> 01:31:15,766
Under her bathing suit.

1016
01:31:16,179 --> 01:31:17,976
I know.

1017
01:31:18,264 --> 01:31:21,688
- Our daughter is a teenager.
- A teenager.

1018
01:31:47,794 --> 01:31:49,511
Wait.

1019
01:31:50,422 --> 01:31:52,799
Where are you going?

1020
01:31:53,717 --> 01:31:57,892
Where I can watch over both of
you until we're together again.

1021
01:32:01,558 --> 01:32:03,776
Good-bye, James.

1022
01:32:25,290 --> 01:32:27,087
Casper?

1023
01:32:46,478 --> 01:32:47,728
Boo?

1024
01:33:07,499 --> 01:33:10,459
Not bad for my first party, huh?

1025
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:12,669
Couldn't have been better.

1026
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:14,338
It ain't over yet.

1027
01:33:14,339 --> 01:33:16,056
Boys?

1028
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:24,765
<i>Casper the friendly ghost</i>

1029
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:27,434
