Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese

2
00:02:01,725 --> 00:02:03,204
Let's go.
Letters are fading.

3
00:02:03,405 --> 00:02:05,282
Where's talent?
We have 5 seconds.

4
00:02:05,485 --> 00:02:07,077
- And the letters?
- It's fine.

5
00:02:07,285 --> 00:02:09,162
Did you get that in shot?

6
00:02:09,405 --> 00:02:10,838
Okay, where's Hal?

7
00:02:11,045 --> 00:02:13,354
I can only hold it
a few seconds.

8
00:02:13,565 --> 00:02:16,398
Get the first team on set.
The letters are fading.

9
00:02:16,605 --> 00:02:18,038
Come on, we gotta go!

10
00:02:18,245 --> 00:02:19,758
- She looks great. Come!
- I'm ready.

11
00:02:20,005 --> 00:02:21,324
- Please.
- Let's go.

12
00:02:21,525 --> 00:02:22,878
Quick review, Nicole.

13
00:02:23,165 --> 00:02:25,440
Get out of the
car, run across...

14
00:02:25,685 --> 00:02:27,277
you see the
skywriting, "Help"...

15
00:02:27,485 --> 00:02:29,077
and realise everything's
gone wrong.

16
00:02:29,325 --> 00:02:31,793
It's incredible.
You had it all figured out.

17
00:02:32,005 --> 00:02:33,916
And now it's all chaos.

18
00:02:34,165 --> 00:02:36,633
You need to
project despair.

19
00:02:37,085 --> 00:02:39,645
- We gotta go. We're losing...
- I know.

20
00:02:39,925 --> 00:02:43,361
Make me feel the
whole human condition.

21
00:02:43,605 --> 00:02:45,038
- You know?
- Lock it up!

22
00:02:49,005 --> 00:02:51,565
Can you stop the drill
for 5 minutes?

23
00:02:51,845 --> 00:02:53,039
What's that, "Help"?

24
00:02:53,365 --> 00:02:55,117
- Roll camera!
- Camera's rolling.

25
00:02:55,405 --> 00:02:56,724
- Speed!
- Higher.

26
00:02:56,925 --> 00:02:58,916
Scene 121, take 1!

27
00:02:59,645 --> 00:03:00,634
Action!

28
00:03:02,925 --> 00:03:05,200
Faster, faster.

29
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,157
You're like a zombie!

30
00:03:07,365 --> 00:03:09,833
Okay, hit the mark.
Look up.

31
00:03:10,165 --> 00:03:12,633
Come on, come on.
And good, good.

32
00:03:12,845 --> 00:03:14,039
Cut! We cut!

33
00:03:14,405 --> 00:03:16,361
Nicole, thank you.

34
00:03:16,645 --> 00:03:18,681
That was amazing.
So compelling.

35
00:03:18,925 --> 00:03:22,315
Your body language, it's
so emotional, everything you do.

36
00:03:22,525 --> 00:03:25,676
You get the big bucks because
you make me look great.

37
00:03:25,885 --> 00:03:28,240
Camp David here.
About the ring.

38
00:03:28,445 --> 00:03:29,764
Mary, here's Nicole.

39
00:03:31,885 --> 00:03:34,797
- Sorry to bug you.
- Okay, pal.

40
00:03:35,045 --> 00:03:36,842
- Do I sign the thing?
- Voucher.

41
00:03:37,045 --> 00:03:37,841
Sure.

42
00:03:38,045 --> 00:03:39,398
You get a voucher?

43
00:03:39,645 --> 00:03:41,317
- Did they get it?
- Let's hope.

44
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:44,039
Our wardrobe, right?
John, take this.

45
00:03:44,245 --> 00:03:47,203
Where do I know you from?
I know you, right?

46
00:03:47,525 --> 00:03:48,435
Thanks.

47
00:03:49,405 --> 00:03:52,124
Chippers in So-Ho.
I waited on you.

48
00:03:52,485 --> 00:03:53,998
What a great memory!

49
00:03:54,245 --> 00:03:56,918
It was a couple
of months ago, right?

50
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,593
But I remembered your face.

51
00:04:00,205 --> 00:04:01,797
And you're an actress.

52
00:04:02,005 --> 00:04:03,120
I'm an extra.

53
00:04:03,325 --> 00:04:04,724
A face in the crowd.

54
00:04:05,005 --> 00:04:06,802
I'll get my sweatshirt.

55
00:04:09,205 --> 00:04:10,957
When do you finish work?

56
00:04:13,605 --> 00:04:16,802
Was that gorgeous black girl
you came with your girlfriend?

57
00:04:17,565 --> 00:04:20,762
It was a guy in drag!
What are you talking about?

58
00:04:21,085 --> 00:04:23,394
- Gorgeous girlfriend?
- Beautiful, whatever it was.

59
00:04:23,605 --> 00:04:26,324
I was writing a
piece on transvestites...

60
00:04:26,525 --> 00:04:29,244
which is why you saw my
"gorgeous girlfriend".

61
00:04:29,445 --> 00:04:31,640
Well if you ever come back...

62
00:04:31,845 --> 00:04:33,722
I get off around midnight.

63
00:04:39,085 --> 00:04:40,313
You need a...

64
00:04:41,605 --> 00:04:43,516
Excuse me, can I borrow...?

65
00:04:44,565 --> 00:04:46,362
Tell me how close I am.

66
00:04:46,565 --> 00:04:48,760
You're from rich parents...

67
00:04:49,005 --> 00:04:52,361
you see a shrink and
you're dyslexic, right?

68
00:04:52,605 --> 00:04:53,640
Thanks.

69
00:04:55,485 --> 00:04:57,476
- That was good.
- I try.

70
00:04:57,725 --> 00:04:59,283
My father's wealthy...

71
00:04:59,525 --> 00:05:01,117
I do see a shrink...

72
00:05:01,325 --> 00:05:04,556
and I'm insomniac,
so you're in the ballpark.

73
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,194
I remember you had
an amazing look.

74
00:05:07,405 --> 00:05:09,282
And I thought,
"Trouble for someone."

75
00:05:09,485 --> 00:05:11,316
I think I dreamt about you.

76
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:13,163
Really, I remember
your face.

77
00:05:13,365 --> 00:05:14,684
Who wouldn't?

78
00:05:14,885 --> 00:05:16,557
Please, sign your voucher.

79
00:05:20,325 --> 00:05:21,280
Thanks.

80
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,556
- Lee!
- Excuse me.

81
00:05:27,765 --> 00:05:28,675
Over here.

82
00:05:29,005 --> 00:05:32,122
Sandy, you'll send the
truffles to the president, right?

83
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:35,084
Tomorrow at 7, okay?
In the park.

84
00:05:35,285 --> 00:05:36,559
- Thanks.
- Here he is.

85
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,480
Sorry.
Ready for our tête-à-tête?

86
00:05:39,725 --> 00:05:41,875
Absolutely.
Everything in hand.

87
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,638
- Bill Gaines.
- How are you?

88
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:45,358
Nicole's press agent.

89
00:05:45,565 --> 00:05:48,159
Please, let's not
dwell on the bulimia.

90
00:05:48,365 --> 00:05:51,277
Believe me, Bill,
this is about lots of things.

91
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:53,396
You said you'd show me
where you grew up.

92
00:05:53,605 --> 00:05:54,799
I did, I promised.

93
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:08,518
It's great we could do this.
Makes a big difference.

94
00:06:08,725 --> 00:06:10,920
So kind of you
to show me.

95
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,514
This stuff makes a
lot of people nervous.

96
00:06:19,845 --> 00:06:21,597
Sorry to disturb you.

97
00:06:22,045 --> 00:06:23,797
This lady lived here...

98
00:06:24,765 --> 00:06:26,517
as a child, years ago.

99
00:06:26,765 --> 00:06:29,279
Nicole Oliver. You must know
her. Great actress.

100
00:06:29,525 --> 00:06:30,719
What d'you want?

101
00:06:30,965 --> 00:06:33,843
He's writing an article
about me...

102
00:06:34,045 --> 00:06:36,081
and I'd like to show him
where I used to live.

103
00:06:36,325 --> 00:06:39,715
Five minutes. It'd be
great for the magazine.

104
00:06:39,925 --> 00:06:41,199
Come in and look around.

105
00:06:41,405 --> 00:06:43,202
- I appreciate it.
- Thank you.

106
00:06:43,685 --> 00:06:45,641
Look how tiny her feet are.

107
00:06:45,885 --> 00:06:47,762
Like, this is
where it all began.

108
00:06:48,005 --> 00:06:49,961
Did you have
feet like that, too?

109
00:06:53,365 --> 00:06:54,957
Strange for you, I guess.

110
00:06:55,645 --> 00:06:58,284
- It's changed, I think.
- I hope so.

111
00:06:58,525 --> 00:07:00,038
It feels smaller.

112
00:07:00,325 --> 00:07:02,395
Small?
That often happens.

113
00:07:02,645 --> 00:07:04,442
How long have you lived here?

114
00:07:05,165 --> 00:07:07,884
Never mind. Can
we go upstairs?

115
00:07:08,085 --> 00:07:09,643
- Terrific.
- Whatever you want.

116
00:07:09,885 --> 00:07:11,443
- Is that okay?
- She said okay.

117
00:07:11,645 --> 00:07:13,681
- I don't care.
- Great. Thank you.

118
00:07:16,485 --> 00:07:18,953
I had this whole wall
plastered...

119
00:07:19,325 --> 00:07:23,079
with movie star photos. I dreamt
about being in a movie...

120
00:07:24,325 --> 00:07:25,678
with Warren Beatty.

121
00:07:25,885 --> 00:07:27,557
You had nice dreams.

122
00:07:29,405 --> 00:07:33,318
And I'd lie on the bed naked
and watch my body develop.

123
00:07:34,845 --> 00:07:35,675
"Naked..."

124
00:07:35,925 --> 00:07:37,517
And I prayed that...

125
00:07:38,085 --> 00:07:40,997
my breasts and legs
would be beautiful...

126
00:07:41,245 --> 00:07:43,440
so I could be
an actress.

127
00:07:44,165 --> 00:07:47,680
You cut a very
erotic figure like that.

128
00:07:48,085 --> 00:07:49,643
I have to say it.

129
00:07:51,565 --> 00:07:53,999
Fortunately I matured quickly.

130
00:07:54,245 --> 00:07:57,362
I remember my brothers
spying on me...

131
00:07:57,605 --> 00:08:01,280
in the shower, or they
rubbed up against me.

132
00:08:02,965 --> 00:08:06,196
I empathise with them
totally. I really...

133
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:07,440
Please.

134
00:08:08,165 --> 00:08:09,314
No?

135
00:08:09,805 --> 00:08:11,716
- Married.
- Happily?

136
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,074
Very.

137
00:08:14,845 --> 00:08:16,722
But you have to work at it.

138
00:08:16,925 --> 00:08:19,678
You have to, if you want
fidelity in a relationship.

139
00:08:20,765 --> 00:08:24,519
But have you ever given
in to lust in this room...

140
00:08:24,765 --> 00:08:27,325
and really let
yourself go...

141
00:08:27,565 --> 00:08:28,759
in a big way?

142
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,722
I can't sleep
with you.

143
00:08:33,925 --> 00:08:37,315
You can't, I know that.
But I had to...

144
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,478
The proximity is...

145
00:08:39,805 --> 00:08:40,874
thrilling...

146
00:08:41,085 --> 00:08:42,598
and irresistible.

147
00:08:42,805 --> 00:08:45,877
- Not that you're not attractive.
- Very kind.

148
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,922
I find you very attractive.

149
00:08:48,165 --> 00:08:51,794
But some things I won't do,
out of commitment.

150
00:08:52,045 --> 00:08:54,161
I hear you. You
don't have to...

151
00:08:54,365 --> 00:08:58,244
I only have intercourse
with my husband, Phil.

152
00:08:59,445 --> 00:09:01,515
My body belongs
to my husband.

153
00:09:01,725 --> 00:09:03,602
Listen, I understand...

154
00:09:03,965 --> 00:09:07,753
But from the neck up,
that's another story.

155
00:09:18,405 --> 00:09:22,239
After your nomination you formed
a production company, right?

156
00:09:22,485 --> 00:09:25,682
Right. You have to develop
your own projects.

157
00:09:25,885 --> 00:09:29,844
You can't imagine the
amount of crap I get sent.

158
00:09:30,085 --> 00:09:32,394
Plus, I'd really like
to direct one day.

159
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,914
Really? Well,
I don't want to be pushy...

160
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:38,083
but I've got a screenplay
I've written...

161
00:09:38,285 --> 00:09:40,401
and today I thought
it might be...

162
00:09:40,605 --> 00:09:43,119
you know, perfect
for you.

163
00:09:43,365 --> 00:09:46,516
Really. Right now
it's written for a man...

164
00:09:46,765 --> 00:09:50,599
but it could easily be
rewritten for a woman.

165
00:09:51,005 --> 00:09:52,040
What's it about?

166
00:09:52,245 --> 00:09:55,601
An armoured car robbery,
but with a personal crisis.

167
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:59,394
- Who would I play?
- One of the guards.

168
00:09:59,885 --> 00:10:02,922
It needs a rewrite, with
a feminist statement.

169
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,604
I know you're politically active...

170
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:07,922
and I think it could
work so well.

171
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,719
I've been working
on it for a year...

172
00:10:10,925 --> 00:10:13,598
and I can't progress
unless a star is involved.

173
00:10:13,845 --> 00:10:15,961
And someone like you, it'd be...

174
00:10:16,165 --> 00:10:18,121
Have you given it to
any actors?

175
00:10:18,325 --> 00:10:21,442
Yeah, but their agents reject
it before they see it...

176
00:10:21,645 --> 00:10:24,284
because I have no track
record as a screenwriter...

177
00:10:24,485 --> 00:10:27,716
although the script gets a
terrific reaction.

178
00:10:28,365 --> 00:10:31,038
- Let me think about it.
- Really?

179
00:10:31,325 --> 00:10:33,839
Great, because I don't want to...

180
00:10:34,205 --> 00:10:36,844
- But I think you'd enjoy it.
- Let me think about it.

181
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,001
Sure.

182
00:10:54,725 --> 00:10:57,000
He's coming!
Come this way!

183
00:10:57,245 --> 00:10:58,598
Come this way, everyone!

184
00:10:58,805 --> 00:11:00,284
It's him. Come on.

185
00:11:00,805 --> 00:11:04,195
We watch you every
Sunday on TV!

186
00:11:04,525 --> 00:11:06,755
We wouldn't miss it
for the world!

187
00:11:06,965 --> 00:11:08,318
Good to see you.

188
00:11:08,525 --> 00:11:10,675
- Will you stay long?
- As long as I can.

189
00:11:10,885 --> 00:11:13,843
Father Gladden is
our guest, from the TV.

190
00:11:14,045 --> 00:11:17,560
Father, my daughter got a prize
at school for charity work.

191
00:11:17,805 --> 00:11:19,955
She'd love to have
your autograph.

192
00:11:20,165 --> 00:11:21,644
Entrance into the
Kingdom of God...

193
00:11:21,845 --> 00:11:24,996
is determined by our response
to the neighbour in need.

194
00:11:25,205 --> 00:11:26,923
I don't know what I'm doing here.

195
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,844
Relax, I was the
same at first.

196
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:33,674
My room's so spare.
And with a Bible!

197
00:11:34,005 --> 00:11:35,324
And the water comes out brown.

198
00:11:35,565 --> 00:11:38,716
I told the handyman. Really,
I know what you're going through.

199
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:41,763
When my husband went off
with his secretary, I was lost.

200
00:11:42,005 --> 00:11:44,678
Someone said,
"You were raised a Catholic.

201
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:48,719
How could you consider a hit man?"
And I heard about this retreat.

202
00:11:48,925 --> 00:11:50,517
- But I'm not religious.
- Nor am I.

203
00:11:50,725 --> 00:11:54,195
My life, religious? I've had
two divorces and two abortions.

204
00:11:54,525 --> 00:11:57,881
But to take a break from
the chaos of the city...

205
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,274
No, no, no.

206
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,680
The water comes out
brown in my room.

207
00:12:01,885 --> 00:12:03,762
And the bed's hard.

208
00:12:04,005 --> 00:12:07,634
You've had a trauma.
No therapy, no pills...

209
00:12:08,045 --> 00:12:09,842
what you need is peace and quiet.

210
00:12:10,165 --> 00:12:12,156
Your emotions
have to settle.

211
00:12:13,605 --> 00:12:16,961
I couldn't go back
to teaching again.

212
00:12:17,245 --> 00:12:18,394
Simplify.

213
00:12:18,765 --> 00:12:21,757
Who's more popular,
the Pope or Elvis?

214
00:12:22,005 --> 00:12:23,757
- I don't think there's any doubt...
- Elvis!

215
00:12:25,325 --> 00:12:28,681
Do you think that the Beatles,
at the height of their fame...

216
00:12:28,965 --> 00:12:30,796
were bigger stars than Jesus?

217
00:12:31,005 --> 00:12:33,838
- World population was smaller...
- Autograph, please?

218
00:12:34,325 --> 00:12:36,839
The food's the worst.
What is this?

219
00:12:37,045 --> 00:12:39,843
I don't know. Shoe leather?
You don't have to eat it.

220
00:12:40,085 --> 00:12:41,438
I asked for it rare.

221
00:12:41,725 --> 00:12:43,283
But you don't like meat.

222
00:12:43,525 --> 00:12:45,880
I said "rare".
You heard me.

223
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,434
I told them twice.
"Not overdone."

224
00:12:48,645 --> 00:12:51,876
Well, we're not
here to enjoy ourselves.

225
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,843
Eat it, or something else.

226
00:12:56,525 --> 00:13:00,279
- The macaroni cheese is good.
- Would you like mine? It's rare.

227
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,714
- That's nice of you.
- Please!

228
00:13:04,005 --> 00:13:04,915
You sure?

229
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:09,954
You see, I can't eat
steak that's not rare.

230
00:13:10,485 --> 00:13:12,282
Doesn't that look nice!

231
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,283
I started as a hobby...

232
00:13:14,485 --> 00:13:17,682
but I get so many orders now,
I can't make them quick enough.

233
00:13:17,885 --> 00:13:19,557
All genuine ceramic.

234
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:22,438
And this rubber
bulb here...

235
00:13:22,725 --> 00:13:26,320
that you fill with
washable red dye.

236
00:13:26,525 --> 00:13:29,801
One squeeze and His
wounds bleed. Watch that.

237
00:13:30,045 --> 00:13:31,398
Isn't that something?

238
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:34,322
- Do you like the country?
- Oh, very much.

239
00:13:34,525 --> 00:13:37,085
I went to a Catholic school,
you know?

240
00:13:37,325 --> 00:13:40,044
So I have moments of
nostalgia for the faith.

241
00:13:41,685 --> 00:13:43,277
Let your soul wander.

242
00:13:43,565 --> 00:13:45,442
And if the miracles
of nature...

243
00:13:45,685 --> 00:13:48,677
lead to intimations of
something larger...

244
00:13:49,085 --> 00:13:51,645
try and have
an open heart.

245
00:13:52,525 --> 00:13:56,438
Are there ticks here?
I'd hate to get Lyme's disease.

246
00:13:56,645 --> 00:13:58,954
- No casualties so far.
- Good.

247
00:13:59,165 --> 00:14:00,598
Could you excuse me?

248
00:14:00,885 --> 00:14:02,113
Yes. Bye.

249
00:14:13,365 --> 00:14:14,593
<i>What, a divorce?</i>

250
00:14:14,885 --> 00:14:16,079
<i>A divorce.</i>

251
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,721
- Try and understand.
- Why?

252
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:22,281
It's not you, it's me.
I have to...

253
00:14:22,525 --> 00:14:24,356
- Pull over!
- Robin, we should...

254
00:14:24,565 --> 00:14:25,680
Pull the fucking car over!

255
00:14:25,925 --> 00:14:27,677
Jesus, will you calm down?

256
00:14:33,485 --> 00:14:36,522
Robin, where are you
going? That's not safe!

257
00:14:39,525 --> 00:14:41,481
Come on. Are you crazy?

258
00:14:41,765 --> 00:14:43,801
This is dangerous.
We can't talk here.

259
00:14:44,045 --> 00:14:45,444
You've met someone else?

260
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:49,477
- I knew you'd think that.
- You have. You're lying.

261
00:14:49,725 --> 00:14:51,078
I haven't. Jesus!

262
00:14:51,365 --> 00:14:55,244
So after 16 fine years,
why a divorce?

263
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:58,914
It's me. I'm confused.

264
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,958
I want a different life, to
go in a different direction.

265
00:15:02,205 --> 00:15:04,275
- Confused? Then see a doctor.
- I did.

266
00:15:04,565 --> 00:15:06,715
Well, that's news!

267
00:15:06,925 --> 00:15:10,315
What other surprises
you got in store?

268
00:15:10,685 --> 00:15:12,403
This wasn't an easy decision.

269
00:15:13,085 --> 00:15:14,598
You've met someone.

270
00:15:14,805 --> 00:15:16,875
No-one just ups and goes.

271
00:15:17,085 --> 00:15:19,155
You know, we got
married so young.

272
00:15:19,365 --> 00:15:21,083
- Never time for living!
- Change your life how?

273
00:15:21,285 --> 00:15:23,003
All we know
is each other!

274
00:15:23,205 --> 00:15:25,435
So who do you want
to explore, Allison?

275
00:15:25,645 --> 00:15:26,964
Why Allison?

276
00:15:27,165 --> 00:15:30,601
- Your hands touched in the car.
- I don't believe this!

277
00:15:31,005 --> 00:15:33,473
And you didn't pull yours away!

278
00:15:33,685 --> 00:15:35,243
You had an affair with Allison!

279
00:15:35,445 --> 00:15:37,197
- Our neighbour!
- Not an affair!

280
00:15:37,445 --> 00:15:40,118
- You slept with her!
- That's why I want a divorce!

281
00:15:40,325 --> 00:15:41,838
To marry Allison?

282
00:15:42,805 --> 00:15:45,114
I can't be dishonest,
and I have been...

283
00:15:45,605 --> 00:15:47,436
and I don't want to do it.

284
00:15:49,645 --> 00:15:51,875
- Who else?
- Nobody else.

285
00:15:54,325 --> 00:15:56,043
Lee, tell me...

286
00:15:56,885 --> 00:15:59,115
now we're clearing the air.

287
00:15:59,405 --> 00:16:01,202
I won't get angry.

288
00:16:01,485 --> 00:16:02,759
Lee, come on.

289
00:16:04,725 --> 00:16:06,204
Let's clear the air.

290
00:16:06,445 --> 00:16:08,117
I won't get angry.

291
00:16:09,525 --> 00:16:10,753
Aren't you cold?

292
00:16:11,005 --> 00:16:12,518
We're clearing the air.

293
00:16:12,765 --> 00:16:14,596
I'm not gonna get angry.

294
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:19,673
Sheila...

295
00:16:21,005 --> 00:16:22,040
Sheila?

296
00:16:24,085 --> 00:16:26,679
You lowlife
motherfucker!

297
00:16:26,925 --> 00:16:29,234
- I can't talk to you!
- My best friend, Sheila!

298
00:16:29,445 --> 00:16:32,642
It's not about women. I'm
depressed about my whole life.

299
00:16:32,885 --> 00:16:34,034
Your life with me?

300
00:16:34,245 --> 00:16:36,554
I hate these stupid
travel pieces!

301
00:16:36,765 --> 00:16:39,757
I tried to talk to you before,
but you're so high-strung.

302
00:16:40,005 --> 00:16:42,235
I mean, we
can't talk!

303
00:16:42,485 --> 00:16:44,601
It's over, you know?
I'm not happy!

304
00:16:48,485 --> 00:16:50,203
Robin, are you okay?

305
00:16:51,365 --> 00:16:53,037
Robin, are you okay?

306
00:16:53,885 --> 00:16:54,715
No.

307
00:16:55,285 --> 00:16:56,718
But I will be.

308
00:18:00,925 --> 00:18:02,677
Do you try to shock people?

309
00:18:03,085 --> 00:18:06,964
One of my best collections.
I'm pleased how it turned out.

310
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:13,641
I'd love to talk
about this location.

311
00:18:13,845 --> 00:18:15,722
We'll definitely get together.

312
00:18:15,925 --> 00:18:17,404
It's an inspired idea!

313
00:18:21,525 --> 00:18:23,641
The skyline enhances
my collection.

314
00:18:24,165 --> 00:18:25,598
The colour's great, isn't it?

315
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:28,239
A fantastic backdrop
for your work.

316
00:18:28,845 --> 00:18:31,405
It'd be great to talk
more about this.

317
00:18:31,605 --> 00:18:32,958
Come next week.

318
00:18:33,165 --> 00:18:35,315
We'll have lunch and I'll
show you round.

319
00:18:35,525 --> 00:18:36,799
Can we talk more now?

320
00:18:37,005 --> 00:18:39,678
- It'd help me with the details.
- Sure, no problem.

321
00:19:09,965 --> 00:19:11,193
Nice car.

322
00:19:12,205 --> 00:19:14,639
Thanks. Want
to drive it?

323
00:19:14,885 --> 00:19:17,194
- Because it's a terrific...
- Is it yours?

324
00:19:17,485 --> 00:19:18,998
Sure. What am I, a car thief?

325
00:19:19,205 --> 00:19:20,957
It's an Aston Martin.

326
00:19:21,805 --> 00:19:23,796
You're welcome, come on.

327
00:19:24,005 --> 00:19:26,235
You've got a wig, it's...

328
00:19:26,525 --> 00:19:27,878
- Camouflage.
- Really?

329
00:19:28,765 --> 00:19:30,118
- Give me the keys.
- Thank you.

330
00:19:30,365 --> 00:19:32,640
You look so much
longer-haired.

331
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:35,079
Got enough room?

332
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,559
Not too fast, the
steering's a little...

333
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,353
Like flying a plane.

334
00:19:45,605 --> 00:19:49,359
Yeah, a 1967 Aston Martin.
Cost me a fortune.

335
00:19:49,725 --> 00:19:52,797
And I had them put
the wheel on the left.

336
00:19:53,365 --> 00:19:55,435
Wanna go for a drink?

337
00:19:57,085 --> 00:19:59,758
I promised a friend I'd
go to his opening.

338
00:20:00,805 --> 00:20:02,397
You know the painter,
Bruce Bishop?

339
00:20:02,605 --> 00:20:04,561
- I've seen his work.
- He's a genius!

340
00:20:04,765 --> 00:20:06,801
You know what?
We'll go to the party...

341
00:20:07,085 --> 00:20:09,394
and have a
drink afterwards.

342
00:20:09,685 --> 00:20:10,595
Really?

343
00:20:11,725 --> 00:20:12,680
Great!

344
00:20:13,885 --> 00:20:16,797
So they commission Oscar to
do a clock tower for a mall.

345
00:20:17,085 --> 00:20:18,723
And what does he propose?

346
00:20:19,405 --> 00:20:21,282
An eight-storey penis.

347
00:20:21,485 --> 00:20:24,682
- Gorgeous. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

348
00:20:24,885 --> 00:20:28,036
- An eight-storey penis?
- In a little town in Kansas.

349
00:20:28,365 --> 00:20:31,323
Imagine these farmers
driving to church...

350
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:33,157
past this giant erection!

351
00:20:34,365 --> 00:20:35,400
Darling!

352
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,275
- How are you?
- Thanks for coming.

353
00:20:38,485 --> 00:20:40,282
- A pleasure.
- I'm in trouble.

354
00:20:40,885 --> 00:20:43,160
Congratulations. Lee Simon.
This is amazing.

355
00:20:43,365 --> 00:20:45,879
- Why in trouble?
- They don't get it.

356
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:50,004
I hate to think about it. Either
you get my work or you don't.

357
00:20:50,725 --> 00:20:53,523
But don't buy my fucking
paintings to be "in".

358
00:20:53,765 --> 00:20:56,563
Only if you have to
have a "Bruce Bishop".

359
00:20:56,765 --> 00:20:58,676
It's all about image.

360
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,916
- One hundred per cent.
- Calm down.

361
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,399
But he's right.

362
00:21:02,605 --> 00:21:04,277
- Bruce, calm down.
- We should go.

363
00:21:04,525 --> 00:21:06,197
- He's upset.
- I know. We should go.

364
00:21:06,445 --> 00:21:08,003
Wait. Are you a Libra?

365
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:11,956
- I'm Sagittarius.
- That's why you're impatient.

366
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:15,641
I'm attracted to Sagittarians,
but they're so impatient.

367
00:21:15,885 --> 00:21:18,524
- Excuse me, would you sign this?
- Of course.

368
00:21:18,805 --> 00:21:20,557
I use your exercise tape.

369
00:21:20,805 --> 00:21:22,158
- You do?
- So do I.

370
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:24,117
But I exercise to it.

371
00:21:24,685 --> 00:21:26,641
I can see. You look great.

372
00:21:26,845 --> 00:21:28,403
- We should...
- Thank you.

373
00:21:28,605 --> 00:21:32,314
- Let's go somewhere quiet.
- You really want to do that?

374
00:21:34,885 --> 00:21:37,558
- How are you?
- You look gorgeous!

375
00:21:42,205 --> 00:21:45,242
I'll get my drink.
I'll be right back.

376
00:21:59,765 --> 00:22:01,244
You're so quiet.

377
00:22:04,325 --> 00:22:05,917
I was thinking that...

378
00:22:06,405 --> 00:22:09,238
you're the most
beautiful creature...

379
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:12,116
I've ever seen.

380
00:22:12,325 --> 00:22:15,044
Every curve in your body...

381
00:22:16,685 --> 00:22:19,916
fulfils its promise. If the
universe has any meaning...

382
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:22,275
I'm looking at it.

383
00:22:24,525 --> 00:22:26,834
- You're sweet.
- And you're perfect.

384
00:22:27,485 --> 00:22:29,680
Do you have any flaws?

385
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,194
Physically?

386
00:22:34,525 --> 00:22:36,675
Any kind. You're
a miracle.

387
00:22:37,045 --> 00:22:39,195
I don't usually
drool in my salad.

388
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:41,561
I'm not usually like this.

389
00:22:42,845 --> 00:22:45,154
I'm polymorphously
perverse.

390
00:22:46,045 --> 00:22:48,036
It's not a flaw.

391
00:22:48,765 --> 00:22:49,880
Just a weakness.

392
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:52,639
Polymorphously perverse,
meaning...?

393
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:56,519
That every part
of my body...

394
00:22:56,765 --> 00:22:58,960
gives me sexual pleasure.

395
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:02,074
Meaning?

396
00:23:03,605 --> 00:23:07,200
Meaning every part of me
gives me erotic pleasure.

397
00:23:08,965 --> 00:23:09,954
And how...?

398
00:23:11,245 --> 00:23:13,201
Sensitive is that?

399
00:23:15,325 --> 00:23:19,159
If you touch my thighs,
my hands, my neck...

400
00:23:19,445 --> 00:23:20,764
my kneecaps...

401
00:23:22,165 --> 00:23:23,803
I'm orgasmic.

402
00:23:25,325 --> 00:23:27,202
Where did you learn this?

403
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:30,077
It's Dionysian.

404
00:23:30,565 --> 00:23:32,078
A Greek taught me.

405
00:23:32,325 --> 00:23:34,236
Now I can't get rid of it.

406
00:23:36,565 --> 00:23:39,238
It's not a flaw,
just a weakness.

407
00:23:41,165 --> 00:23:42,837
Just to get this right.

408
00:23:43,085 --> 00:23:45,474
If I touch your hand...

409
00:23:45,765 --> 00:23:49,360
if I take it and
just stroke it...

410
00:23:49,725 --> 00:23:51,875
if I stroke it like
this, you...?

411
00:23:54,245 --> 00:23:55,519
My God!

412
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,477
Let's get out of here.
I'll get the check.

413
00:23:57,685 --> 00:23:59,960
I'll get the coat and...

414
00:24:00,245 --> 00:24:02,554
Come on, guys,
we're going dancing!

415
00:24:02,805 --> 00:24:04,033
Dancing? Great!

416
00:24:04,245 --> 00:24:06,122
- I can't dance.
- We'll dance!

417
00:24:06,405 --> 00:24:08,919
- I can't dance.
- Everybody can dance.

418
00:24:09,405 --> 00:24:11,316
- Let's dance.
- I'll get the check.

419
00:24:11,605 --> 00:24:14,517
My God, I know I've
told a lot of atheist jokes...

420
00:24:14,765 --> 00:24:18,553
and I have no right to ask for
this, but that was just her hand!

421
00:24:37,285 --> 00:24:39,640
- Shit!
- What? What's wrong?

422
00:24:40,005 --> 00:24:41,836
I need echinacea
right away.

423
00:24:42,045 --> 00:24:43,842
- Right away!
- Echinacea?

424
00:24:44,205 --> 00:24:45,923
It's for colds.

425
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:48,923
Let's go find some.
Let's leave.

426
00:24:49,165 --> 00:24:51,440
The health food stores
will be closed.

427
00:24:51,645 --> 00:24:53,203
I know an all-night
drugstore.

428
00:24:53,405 --> 00:24:55,839
They won't have it.
And I have none at home!

429
00:24:56,045 --> 00:24:58,115
I'm going to
Milan tomorrow!

430
00:24:58,965 --> 00:24:59,761
Yes.

431
00:25:00,925 --> 00:25:02,199
Ecchymosis?

432
00:25:02,605 --> 00:25:04,880
No, I told you,
it's an herb.

433
00:25:06,365 --> 00:25:09,914
Because I can't hear you!
It's an herb!

434
00:25:41,925 --> 00:25:44,519
I couldn't find any
echinacea.

435
00:25:44,725 --> 00:25:46,602
You need echinacea?

436
00:25:46,805 --> 00:25:49,524
- You have some?
- I always carry some.

437
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:51,040
He's got some.

438
00:25:53,565 --> 00:25:54,554
So where to?

439
00:25:54,765 --> 00:25:57,996
We should go, you got
to fly to Milan tomorrow.

440
00:25:58,485 --> 00:25:59,554
No, it's okay.

441
00:25:59,765 --> 00:26:01,721
"Stuff a cold,
starve a fever"

442
00:26:01,925 --> 00:26:03,074
Really, it's okay.

443
00:26:03,285 --> 00:26:05,879
Incidentally, you're a
tremendous athlete.

444
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:08,599
I'm sure you have
an enormous future.

445
00:26:08,805 --> 00:26:09,954
This your car?

446
00:26:10,165 --> 00:26:12,156
Yeah, an Aston Martin.
It's very old.

447
00:26:12,365 --> 00:26:15,675
Forget it, it costs a fortune.
I used to have a Volvo.

448
00:26:15,885 --> 00:26:18,035
I'll call you when we
play the Knicks.

449
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,594
Right. I'll give you my number.

450
00:26:21,925 --> 00:26:22,914
You know...

451
00:26:23,525 --> 00:26:25,004
you're amazing.

452
00:26:25,285 --> 00:26:28,004
I notice that men
just stare at you.

453
00:26:28,245 --> 00:26:30,918
I mean, women stare at you!
It's incredible.

454
00:26:31,485 --> 00:26:33,441
- I used to live with a woman.
- Really?

455
00:26:34,565 --> 00:26:36,760
A beautiful young
German model.

456
00:26:37,845 --> 00:26:41,042
The looks we got when
we danced together!

457
00:26:41,805 --> 00:26:43,636
But you prefer men?

458
00:26:47,165 --> 00:26:48,518
Usually.

459
00:27:00,045 --> 00:27:01,114
That's great.

460
00:27:01,365 --> 00:27:04,163
You're not afraid
of catching germs?

461
00:27:04,445 --> 00:27:05,924
I've got a cold.

462
00:27:06,205 --> 00:27:09,277
From you, I'd be willing
to catch terminal cancer.

463
00:27:10,525 --> 00:27:11,799
My place or yours?

464
00:27:12,045 --> 00:27:14,036
Whichever makes you happier.

465
00:27:17,045 --> 00:27:18,364
My place.

466
00:27:18,565 --> 00:27:20,442
I have a mirror
next to the bed.

467
00:27:20,645 --> 00:27:22,442
You have a mirror.

468
00:27:23,005 --> 00:27:24,199
Sure.

469
00:27:28,405 --> 00:27:30,760
My God! I'm
so sorry!

470
00:27:31,765 --> 00:27:33,960
You're okay? Not bleeding?

471
00:27:34,205 --> 00:27:36,161
Just a little shaken!

472
00:27:37,085 --> 00:27:38,643
Christ, what were you thinking?

473
00:27:38,845 --> 00:27:41,996
I hope the police don't
give me a balloon test.

474
00:27:42,205 --> 00:27:44,196
- They'd misinterpret this.
- The police?

475
00:27:44,405 --> 00:27:47,761
I can't be connected with
a drunk-driving accident!

476
00:27:48,005 --> 00:27:49,233
I'm not drunk!

477
00:27:49,445 --> 00:27:51,083
The tabloids will
kill me!

478
00:27:51,285 --> 00:27:54,834
I just signed an endorsement
with a cosmetic company!

479
00:27:56,165 --> 00:27:59,760
I got to go. I'll be
fine. I'll get a cab.

480
00:28:00,485 --> 00:28:02,396
No, I'll take you, because...

481
00:28:02,685 --> 00:28:05,483
Are you crazy?
Look at your Aston Martin!

482
00:28:05,765 --> 00:28:08,040
I can claim it in the morning.
The night is young.

483
00:28:08,325 --> 00:28:10,281
I wanted to see your mirror.

484
00:28:10,645 --> 00:28:12,795
You can't leave the
scene of an accident.

485
00:28:13,085 --> 00:28:15,121
This is a bad neighbourhood.
You should...

486
00:28:15,325 --> 00:28:16,997
I'll be fine.

487
00:28:17,245 --> 00:28:18,883
I'm a black belt.

488
00:28:20,445 --> 00:28:23,960
- But if you're bleeding internally?
- Nice to meet you!

489
00:28:28,965 --> 00:28:30,398
Fucking cold!

490
00:28:31,045 --> 00:28:32,034
Rain!

491
00:28:34,885 --> 00:28:36,637
I've been waiting for 2 hours.

492
00:28:36,845 --> 00:28:39,359
- I've been waiting too.
- Dr Lupus knows you're here.

493
00:28:39,565 --> 00:28:40,839
I can't wait.

494
00:28:41,085 --> 00:28:44,839
- If you'd like to reschedule...
- I made this appointment in June.

495
00:28:45,245 --> 00:28:47,634
I've been waiting a year
for my appointment.

496
00:28:47,925 --> 00:28:51,122
I know a woman who sold
her appointment for $3,000.

497
00:28:52,765 --> 00:28:54,995
If they're going to touch
me, I want the best.

498
00:28:55,285 --> 00:28:58,960
I understand. Since that
Newsweek article, we're overrun.

499
00:28:59,805 --> 00:29:01,557
- Dr. Lupus!
- A few minutes.

500
00:29:02,045 --> 00:29:03,558
Very interesting. I
can work with that.

501
00:29:03,765 --> 00:29:05,437
Miss Lipton in 7.

502
00:29:05,965 --> 00:29:08,957
It's really worth the wait.
The man's an artist.

503
00:29:09,365 --> 00:29:10,514
Dr. Lupus, hello.

504
00:29:10,725 --> 00:29:13,000
I'm worried about my jowls.
What do you think?

505
00:29:13,205 --> 00:29:14,194
Yes, they'll go.

506
00:29:14,445 --> 00:29:16,481
- Some of the neck, too.
- Excuse me.

507
00:29:19,245 --> 00:29:21,805
No, no, those eyes
have to be wider.

508
00:29:22,045 --> 00:29:24,354
And we got to get
rid of the double chin.

509
00:29:24,565 --> 00:29:27,875
I want to make you look like
Pearl Chavez, the fiery half-breed.

510
00:29:28,165 --> 00:29:31,475
"Duel in the Sun", right? They'll
think you have Indian blood.

511
00:29:31,685 --> 00:29:32,481
Thank you.

512
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,084
I don't know why I'm here.

513
00:29:35,325 --> 00:29:38,283
Herman, she needs a makeover.
Thanks for fitting us in.

514
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,474
Please, please!

515
00:29:39,725 --> 00:29:41,283
You're very special to me.

516
00:29:41,565 --> 00:29:43,635
- Do I need a makeover?
- Why be less than perfect?

517
00:29:43,845 --> 00:29:45,403
What can we do with the eyes?

518
00:29:45,605 --> 00:29:47,197
I see what you mean.
They're beady.

519
00:29:47,405 --> 00:29:49,999
- And tighten this up, too.
- Beady?

520
00:29:50,245 --> 00:29:51,997
I told her you
were a genius.

521
00:29:52,205 --> 00:29:53,638
I read that
Newsweek article.

522
00:29:53,845 --> 00:29:56,234
- The lips a little fuller?
- Fuller?

523
00:29:56,445 --> 00:29:58,595
Not if you prefer that
cold, stressful look.

524
00:29:58,805 --> 00:30:00,557
- Are they too thin?
- It won't be noticeable.

525
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:03,325
Well, noticeable,
but not artificial.

526
00:30:03,525 --> 00:30:05,197
The cameras are here.

527
00:30:05,405 --> 00:30:08,044
Thank you. I'm on
"News at Noon".

528
00:30:08,285 --> 00:30:11,322
We're in the plush office
of a man called...

529
00:30:11,565 --> 00:30:13,476
"the Michelangelo
of Manhattan".

530
00:30:13,725 --> 00:30:16,444
- Ignore the camera.
- And your breasts and buttocks?

531
00:30:16,685 --> 00:30:18,641
As with the great Renaissance
sculptor...

532
00:30:18,885 --> 00:30:21,479
unsightly flesh is molded
and suctioned away...

533
00:30:21,685 --> 00:30:25,360
until only youth remains...
or the illusion of youth.

534
00:30:26,045 --> 00:30:28,240
I'm out of here. I should go.

535
00:30:28,885 --> 00:30:32,355
Outside in the waiting room,
anxious faces...

536
00:30:32,605 --> 00:30:34,914
await transmogrification
into perfection.

537
00:30:35,165 --> 00:30:39,124
We don't do penis enlargements.
We don't have the space.

538
00:30:39,525 --> 00:30:41,322
We're talking about 3 inches.

539
00:30:42,245 --> 00:30:44,076
Socialite Pinky Virdon...

540
00:30:44,285 --> 00:30:46,924
uses the VIP entrance
for the privileged few...

541
00:30:47,165 --> 00:30:49,998
who do not have to plan eons
in advance for an appointment.

542
00:30:50,325 --> 00:30:52,156
I'm not blaming you, I have to go.

543
00:30:52,525 --> 00:30:53,719
I'll tell you what.

544
00:30:53,925 --> 00:30:54,994
I'll get your coat.

545
00:30:55,205 --> 00:30:57,799
- We'll go out the side exit.
- The side exit.

546
00:30:58,005 --> 00:30:59,643
Relax, I'll be right back.

547
00:31:00,285 --> 00:31:02,003
The waiting room's here.

548
00:31:02,245 --> 00:31:04,679
Why don't you get comments
from those women?

549
00:31:04,965 --> 00:31:06,478
Don't forget the nurses.

550
00:31:06,685 --> 00:31:08,596
Sorry if we're
disturbing you.

551
00:31:08,965 --> 00:31:10,364
I got a film crew here.

552
00:31:10,565 --> 00:31:12,920
- I was just going.
- Dr Lupus said...

553
00:31:13,325 --> 00:31:16,158
He did a great job on you.
You look great.

554
00:31:17,845 --> 00:31:19,437
Are my lips too thin?

555
00:31:19,765 --> 00:31:22,757
Not for me. Whatever he
charged you, it was worth it.

556
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:24,637
Thanks very much.

557
00:31:24,885 --> 00:31:28,673
I'm Tony Gardella.
I produce "News at Noon."

558
00:31:29,045 --> 00:31:31,400
- And you are?
- Robin Simon.

559
00:31:31,605 --> 00:31:32,879
What do you do?

560
00:31:33,245 --> 00:31:34,394
I'm a schoolteacher.

561
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:35,959
Teacher?

562
00:31:36,285 --> 00:31:39,595
Great, so you saved your money,
invested it here and now...

563
00:31:39,845 --> 00:31:41,437
you're a knockout!

564
00:31:41,725 --> 00:31:44,637
I'm here for a consultation.
He hasn't done anything to me.

565
00:31:44,885 --> 00:31:45,920
Really?

566
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,794
From the point of
view of a total stranger...

567
00:31:49,005 --> 00:31:50,916
I wouldn't change a freckle.

568
00:31:51,365 --> 00:31:52,957
Well thank you.

569
00:31:55,045 --> 00:31:58,560
"I have always depended on
the kindness of strangers."

570
00:32:05,845 --> 00:32:08,643
Well, I better get
on with this thing.

571
00:32:09,765 --> 00:32:11,278
Back to work.

572
00:32:16,325 --> 00:32:17,155
Listen...

573
00:32:17,485 --> 00:32:18,679
forgive me, but...

574
00:32:18,925 --> 00:32:22,679
are you married or anything? And
if not, what are you doing later?

575
00:32:22,885 --> 00:32:24,841
- Later, when?
- Six o'clock.

576
00:32:25,085 --> 00:32:27,201
- Why?
- Want to go to a screening?

577
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,400
A screening?

578
00:32:28,605 --> 00:32:30,561
Of a new John
Papadakis film.

579
00:32:30,765 --> 00:32:33,279
I have to go and I thought
you'd like to go.

580
00:32:38,725 --> 00:32:41,319
Thank you,
but I can't.

581
00:32:43,485 --> 00:32:45,237
I don't often go to the films...

582
00:32:45,485 --> 00:32:48,477
and I haven't
heard of that director.

583
00:32:48,725 --> 00:32:51,239
But thanks for
thinking of me.

584
00:32:51,525 --> 00:32:52,753
She'll be happy to go.

585
00:32:52,965 --> 00:32:54,159
This is my...

586
00:32:54,445 --> 00:32:57,198
Accepting for Ms. Simon,
her friend, Cheryl.

587
00:32:58,165 --> 00:33:00,918
And your divorce? Are you
friendly with your ex-husband?

588
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:03,081
We would be if we met.

589
00:33:03,325 --> 00:33:06,158
I mean, this is the age
of psychotherapy, right?

590
00:33:06,365 --> 00:33:09,243
Everyone's so
sophisticated and mature.

591
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:10,798
Hi, how are you?

592
00:33:11,085 --> 00:33:13,645
At least you're
not still angry.

593
00:33:15,205 --> 00:33:17,082
No, that phase is over.

594
00:33:17,445 --> 00:33:20,164
You have to stop
tantrumming...

595
00:33:20,405 --> 00:33:21,963
and move on with life.

596
00:33:22,165 --> 00:33:24,315
The champagne tastes
like it was made yesterday.

597
00:33:24,605 --> 00:33:26,402
Think so? I
kind of liked it.

598
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:29,478
But I'm feeling lightheaded.
I shouldn't drink any more.

599
00:33:29,685 --> 00:33:31,277
I wish I felt lightheaded.

600
00:33:31,645 --> 00:33:33,283
- I hate these screenings.
- Do you?

601
00:33:33,485 --> 00:33:35,396
I'd rather see
a real audience.

602
00:33:36,685 --> 00:33:40,439
I should know all these people,
but I'm so out of touch.

603
00:33:41,445 --> 00:33:42,958
Let's see. You see that guy?

604
00:33:43,205 --> 00:33:45,594
That's Papadakis, the
director of the film.

605
00:33:45,845 --> 00:33:47,881
Yeah, he's arty and pretentious.

606
00:33:48,085 --> 00:33:51,555
One of those assholes who always
films in black and white.

607
00:33:51,925 --> 00:33:53,643
Tom Dale. Big star!

608
00:33:53,885 --> 00:33:57,002
He's filming an adaptation
of a sequel of a remake.

609
00:33:57,605 --> 00:34:00,403
Getting out of the elevator
is a famous critic.

610
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:01,879
Him, I recognise.

611
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:03,444
He used to hate every movie.

612
00:34:03,645 --> 00:34:06,842
But he married a young, big-bosomed
woman and now he loves every movie.

613
00:34:07,205 --> 00:34:09,321
God, I'm so out of touch.

614
00:34:09,645 --> 00:34:11,158
Can I get you a refill?

615
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:13,721
Yes!

616
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:15,922
What the hell? Why not?

617
00:34:17,205 --> 00:34:19,719
If I could think of what to do
I'd never go back to teaching.

618
00:34:19,965 --> 00:34:22,035
- Come work for me.
- As what?

619
00:34:22,245 --> 00:34:24,236
All I'm good at is Chaucer.

620
00:34:24,445 --> 00:34:26,356
Well, we have a
cooking show.

621
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:29,238
You could do "Great
Writers' Recipes."

622
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:32,039
"Chaucer's Fettucini
with Clam Sauce."

623
00:34:32,565 --> 00:34:34,601
"Walter Raleigh's Gazpacho."

624
00:34:34,805 --> 00:34:36,477
No, that's okay.

625
00:34:36,685 --> 00:34:39,802
But I'm glad you asked me out.
I'm having a very nice...

626
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,122
- What's the matter?
- Lee!

627
00:34:43,325 --> 00:34:45,077
- Who's Lee?
- My husband.

628
00:34:45,285 --> 00:34:47,355
- Your husband?
- I don't want to see him here!

629
00:34:47,565 --> 00:34:49,795
I thought you said
it was no problem.

630
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:52,565
- Stand there, stand there.
- All right, all right.

631
00:34:52,805 --> 00:34:54,602
No, no! There, there.

632
00:34:54,805 --> 00:34:57,160
Talk to me. Act
natural, for chrissake!

633
00:34:57,365 --> 00:34:59,162
No, more to the left!

634
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:00,754
Oh, God!

635
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:04,002
- No, he's going to see me.
- Where are you going?

636
00:35:04,205 --> 00:35:06,924
- Is he there?
- I don't know who he is.

637
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:09,639
- Is he going into the cinema?
- There's a blond guy coming.

638
00:35:09,845 --> 00:35:11,437
Is that who I think it is?

639
00:35:11,685 --> 00:35:14,040
Robin, what are you doing here?

640
00:35:15,485 --> 00:35:17,203
I'm looking for...

641
00:35:17,485 --> 00:35:19,237
I dropped my earring!

642
00:35:19,525 --> 00:35:20,594
I found it!

643
00:35:20,845 --> 00:35:23,518
Bonnie, this is Robin.
Robin, this is Bonnie.

644
00:35:23,805 --> 00:35:25,841
- How are you?
- How am I?

645
00:35:26,045 --> 00:35:28,195
How am I?
You mean now?

646
00:35:28,405 --> 00:35:29,474
You mean...

647
00:35:29,685 --> 00:35:31,277
my physical health?

648
00:35:32,045 --> 00:35:35,355
- Whatever. Or spiritual.
- I'm fine. Thirsty.

649
00:35:35,565 --> 00:35:36,759
Nice to meet you.

650
00:35:38,085 --> 00:35:39,279
Oh dear!

651
00:35:40,285 --> 00:35:41,513
I guess we won't have a drink.

652
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:43,477
- We'll go in and...
- See you in there.

653
00:35:43,685 --> 00:35:46,438
Catch you inside.
Nice to see you.

654
00:35:55,285 --> 00:35:58,561
- Are you all right?
- I shouldn't drink.

655
00:36:00,685 --> 00:36:02,676
His use of
these flashbacks...

656
00:36:02,885 --> 00:36:05,445
and slow motion is
pretentious, isn't it?

657
00:36:05,725 --> 00:36:07,477
And that harlot he's with?

658
00:36:08,765 --> 00:36:10,323
You think she's pretty?

659
00:36:11,285 --> 00:36:14,595
Probably one of those
porn channel outcalls.

660
00:36:14,845 --> 00:36:17,359
You dial a number
if you need an escort.

661
00:36:17,605 --> 00:36:20,039
Escort! I mean, really!

662
00:36:20,245 --> 00:36:23,396
Deep massage, they say.
But that's bullshit.

663
00:36:23,605 --> 00:36:25,482
You probably
dial 588-PUSS Y.

664
00:36:25,685 --> 00:36:28,199
I think she's an editor
for Random House, but...

665
00:36:28,405 --> 00:36:30,873
How could you have slept with
Sheila, my best friend?

666
00:36:31,165 --> 00:36:33,076
You found her bovine.

667
00:36:33,885 --> 00:36:35,955
His word: "Bovine".

668
00:36:36,565 --> 00:36:37,600
Am I lying?

669
00:36:37,805 --> 00:36:41,400
Didn't you say she
was a vache hollandaise?

670
00:36:41,805 --> 00:36:42,954
Didn't you?

671
00:36:43,485 --> 00:36:44,838
Am I lying?

672
00:36:46,485 --> 00:36:50,273
- You're sick, that's what!
- Lie in front of these people?

673
00:37:07,005 --> 00:37:08,563
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

674
00:37:08,765 --> 00:37:10,084
No, I lost control.

675
00:37:10,285 --> 00:37:12,435
I guess you're still
in love with him.

676
00:37:12,645 --> 00:37:13,873
I guess I am.

677
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:15,564
Good night.

678
00:37:16,965 --> 00:37:18,523
Well, think about what I said.

679
00:37:18,725 --> 00:37:21,319
- About what?
- About coming to work for me.

680
00:37:21,845 --> 00:37:23,403
That's a fantasy.

681
00:37:24,725 --> 00:37:26,078
You're bright. You'd learn.

682
00:37:26,525 --> 00:37:30,074
My company's growing.
You could grow with us.

683
00:37:31,405 --> 00:37:32,918
Too inhibited.

684
00:37:33,325 --> 00:37:35,964
- That's a shame.
- I'm sorry.

685
00:37:36,485 --> 00:37:37,600
Good night.

686
00:37:47,925 --> 00:37:51,474
- Did you like the movie?
- I hate Papadakis.

687
00:37:51,685 --> 00:37:53,835
One cliché after another.

688
00:37:54,325 --> 00:37:57,840
When you see these scripts,
it's so depressing.

689
00:37:59,565 --> 00:38:01,840
Were you upset about
the run-in with your ex?

690
00:38:02,725 --> 00:38:05,523
She's an hysteric.
I'm lucky I got out.

691
00:38:05,805 --> 00:38:08,194
Tonight was proof
positive, if I needed proof.

692
00:38:08,525 --> 00:38:10,356
Sounds like you're
protesting too much.

693
00:38:10,565 --> 00:38:13,682
No, my class reunion was
the defining moment for me.

694
00:38:14,005 --> 00:38:15,836
<i>- How's that?</i>
<i>- A class reunion last year.</i>

695
00:38:16,045 --> 00:38:17,444
<i>Take my advice. Don't do it.</i>

696
00:38:17,645 --> 00:38:20,034
Doris, Doris! How are you?

697
00:38:20,285 --> 00:38:21,798
- You look the same.
- Great to see you.

698
00:38:22,005 --> 00:38:24,200
- This is Nat.
- Hi, Nat, how are you?

699
00:38:24,405 --> 00:38:26,794
- What are you up to?
- I work in imports.

700
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:29,121
- What are you doing?
- I write for a travel magazine.

701
00:38:29,325 --> 00:38:30,678
Get to travel for free?

702
00:38:30,885 --> 00:38:34,355
Free, yeah, tell me about it.
We crash-landed in Dubrovnik!

703
00:38:34,565 --> 00:38:35,680
Eddie, Eddie!

704
00:38:35,885 --> 00:38:37,318
- Look what the cat dragged in.
- Nice to see you.

705
00:38:37,525 --> 00:38:39,322
This is Lenore, my wife.

706
00:38:40,005 --> 00:38:41,233
What are you up to?

707
00:38:41,445 --> 00:38:44,243
We've got four kids.
Two on the way.

708
00:38:44,525 --> 00:38:46,436
What do you do when
you're not procreating?

709
00:38:46,685 --> 00:38:47,800
I forget.

710
00:38:48,005 --> 00:38:50,360
I'm a dentist, that's it.
Have you seen Jay Tepper?

711
00:38:50,565 --> 00:38:52,920
Not for ages.
I don't believe this!

712
00:38:53,125 --> 00:38:55,764
- Lee, how are you?
- I'm good.

713
00:38:55,965 --> 00:38:58,399
- What are you doing these days?
- Hanging in there.

714
00:38:58,605 --> 00:39:00,436
Still running and killing the girls?

715
00:39:00,645 --> 00:39:01,998
I'm long married.

716
00:39:02,245 --> 00:39:04,713
This is my wife, speaking
of married. Mary.

717
00:39:04,965 --> 00:39:07,399
- Where's your wife?
- She has shingles.

718
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:09,044
Psychological.

719
00:39:09,325 --> 00:39:10,314
You a shrink?

720
00:39:10,525 --> 00:39:12,516
Not exactly, I'm
a psychoanalyst.

721
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:15,000
Can you believe this guy?

722
00:39:15,245 --> 00:39:17,122
- Come and give me a call.
- A call?

723
00:39:17,485 --> 00:39:20,841
Monroe Gordon, and his
lovely wife, Dana.

724
00:39:21,205 --> 00:39:24,914
Monroe, whom you all remember
was in our "Guys and Dolls"...

725
00:39:25,605 --> 00:39:28,677
and who went on to a
successful singing career...

726
00:39:28,965 --> 00:39:29,795
in Broadway...

727
00:39:30,205 --> 00:39:31,604
in Atlantic City...

728
00:39:31,845 --> 00:39:34,882
Carlton's Restaurant off the
Sunrise Highway...

729
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:38,434
and the Sunrise Lounge.

730
00:39:40,125 --> 00:39:44,004
Monroe will sing a song made
popular in our school years.

731
00:40:13,165 --> 00:40:15,599
<i>What happened to my classmates?</i>
<i>Everyone's so...</i>

732
00:40:16,485 --> 00:40:18,635
<i>mature-looking and fat.</i>

733
00:40:18,925 --> 00:40:20,836
<i>I didn't age that much.</i>

734
00:40:21,165 --> 00:40:23,395
<i>Unless I did and I can't see it.</i>

735
00:40:23,605 --> 00:40:27,393
<i>All these dentists, veterinarians</i>
<i>and antique dealers...</i>

736
00:40:28,165 --> 00:40:31,475
<i>capped teeth and bald heads,</i>
<i>grey hairs coming...</i>

737
00:40:32,005 --> 00:40:33,563
<i>Sam Jablon has that rug on.</i>

738
00:40:33,805 --> 00:40:37,320
<i>Looks like it fell on him from</i>
<i>a window and nobody told him.</i>

739
00:40:37,885 --> 00:40:41,514
<i>Some dead already. Annette</i>
<i>DeAngelo, breasts I caressed...</i>

740
00:40:41,765 --> 00:40:44,074
<i>lying cold in the ground!</i>

741
00:40:44,805 --> 00:40:47,365
<i>God, how I wanted to</i>
<i>sleep with Polly Weiss.</i>

742
00:40:47,605 --> 00:40:49,357
<i>Now she's turned into her mother.</i>

743
00:40:49,765 --> 00:40:53,599
<i>Freddie Kaplan's my age. Looks</i>
<i>like he's from my father's club.</i>

744
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:55,996
<i>I'm fucking Prufrock.</i>

745
00:40:56,845 --> 00:40:59,996
I've got to change
before it's too late.

746
00:41:00,445 --> 00:41:01,594
Pardon me?

747
00:41:02,285 --> 00:41:04,082
I'm not happy, Jay.

748
00:41:04,765 --> 00:41:06,835
Married too young.

749
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:10,441
Neither of us had the
chance to live, to explore.

750
00:41:10,725 --> 00:41:13,080
These aren't
my office hours.

751
00:41:13,325 --> 00:41:16,715
I'm talking to you while
there's still time.

752
00:41:17,325 --> 00:41:20,715
I just turned 40. I don't
want to look up at 50...

753
00:41:20,965 --> 00:41:24,162
to find I've measured out
my life with coffee spoons.

754
00:41:24,405 --> 00:41:26,361
Try and relax.

755
00:41:28,005 --> 00:41:30,155
And put the vodka down.

756
00:41:30,525 --> 00:41:34,040
Robin's lovely.
She's a little neurotic...

757
00:41:36,165 --> 00:41:39,919
but I don't want to spend my life
as husband to a schoolteacher...

758
00:41:40,285 --> 00:41:43,118
writing the occasional
travel piece...

759
00:41:43,445 --> 00:41:45,163
and never knowing...

760
00:41:45,605 --> 00:41:47,561
what it's like to make love...

761
00:41:47,925 --> 00:41:51,634
to that sleazy blonde that's
married to Monroe Gordon.

762
00:41:53,405 --> 00:41:54,599
The truth is that...

763
00:41:54,805 --> 00:41:57,273
Robin is dull in bed.

764
00:41:57,605 --> 00:41:59,800
Fucking Catholic
inhibitions.

765
00:42:00,045 --> 00:42:03,515
I don't know, maybe I
don't excite her anymore.

766
00:42:04,805 --> 00:42:07,160
I don't know what's true anymore.

767
00:42:07,445 --> 00:42:09,356
Listen, are you in treatment?

768
00:42:09,565 --> 00:42:11,920
One minute you're in
the school lunchroom...

769
00:42:12,165 --> 00:42:13,564
you fucking blink...

770
00:42:13,805 --> 00:42:16,319
and you're 40.
Blink again...

771
00:42:16,565 --> 00:42:20,274
and you can see movies at half
price for senior citizens.

772
00:42:21,325 --> 00:42:24,158
"Ask not for whom the bell tolls."

773
00:42:25,045 --> 00:42:26,876
Or to be more exact...

774
00:42:27,085 --> 00:42:29,599
ask not for whom
the toilet flushes.

775
00:42:43,045 --> 00:42:45,354
Where were you while we
were making love?

776
00:42:45,565 --> 00:42:48,875
You know, in high school
I was Class Writer.

777
00:42:49,085 --> 00:42:52,361
That's why I tell you to
forget the screenplays...

778
00:42:52,565 --> 00:42:55,398
- and go back to writing your novel.
- Too inhibited.

779
00:42:55,645 --> 00:42:57,795
So you'll never get over
some bad reviews?

780
00:42:58,005 --> 00:43:00,758
My two novels were
dismissed. It was brutal.

781
00:43:01,005 --> 00:43:03,360
Maybe after I sell a
screenplay.

782
00:43:03,605 --> 00:43:05,004
Film is where it's at.

783
00:43:05,205 --> 00:43:07,799
Who reads books anymore?
Not young kids.

784
00:43:08,005 --> 00:43:11,236
- They're into cinema, movies.
- I don't believe that. Nor do you.

785
00:43:11,445 --> 00:43:13,083
Why are you getting dressed?

786
00:43:13,605 --> 00:43:16,483
Going home. Isn't
that what you want?

787
00:43:17,445 --> 00:43:19,322
I don't know what I want.

788
00:43:20,005 --> 00:43:23,634
You're the only one who makes
sense to me since my divorce.

789
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:26,685
I don't want someone
to make sense to.

790
00:43:27,245 --> 00:43:29,281
I want someone to get
irrational over me.

791
00:43:29,485 --> 00:43:33,364
Maybe after I sell my armoured
car robbery script...

792
00:43:33,565 --> 00:43:35,999
I'll get back to
something more serious.

793
00:43:36,245 --> 00:43:39,442
Philip's having a dinner next
week. I'd love you to come.

794
00:43:39,645 --> 00:43:41,124
Philip Datloff?

795
00:43:41,445 --> 00:43:44,642
- He's sweet. You'll like him.
- I'd be too intimidated.

796
00:43:45,085 --> 00:43:48,680
An editor of his stature? I'd
feel guilty I wasn't writing.

797
00:43:49,805 --> 00:43:53,036
- I want you two to meet.
- I won't know what to say.

798
00:43:54,165 --> 00:43:55,564
So what's your novel about?

799
00:43:55,765 --> 00:43:58,837
- I don't have a novel, it's more...
- No, he does, he does.

800
00:43:59,085 --> 00:44:01,758
Been working on
it for over a year.

801
00:44:02,005 --> 00:44:05,475
- From what I've seen, it's terrific.
- Bonnie is a gifted editor.

802
00:44:05,725 --> 00:44:07,681
- I know this.
- I'm grooming her for my job.

803
00:44:07,885 --> 00:44:09,557
I didn't have the emotional
energy to finish it.

804
00:44:09,765 --> 00:44:13,235
And how many people read it?
Do a film, and it reaches millions.

805
00:44:13,485 --> 00:44:15,794
It's not energy, it's confidence.

806
00:44:16,325 --> 00:44:19,203
- His first two books...
- Were obliterated. The 3 S's.

807
00:44:19,405 --> 00:44:21,873
Self-indulgent, sophomoric,
solipsistic.

808
00:44:22,085 --> 00:44:25,077
If every writer who got bad press
at first caved in...

809
00:44:25,285 --> 00:44:26,354
You're too thin-skinned.

810
00:44:26,565 --> 00:44:28,681
My God, it's V.J. Rajnipal.

811
00:44:29,045 --> 00:44:30,717
- Excuse me.
- Philip's his editor.

812
00:44:30,965 --> 00:44:34,753
What am I doing here? That guy
won the Nobel and deserved...

813
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:38,680
I'm out of my league.
Awash in self-contempt.

814
00:44:39,685 --> 00:44:42,677
You know Irwin Shaw wrote
the best anti-war play ever...

815
00:44:42,885 --> 00:44:44,318
and got it all into one act?

816
00:44:44,565 --> 00:44:47,159
Interesting you should say
that, he was my idol.

817
00:44:47,365 --> 00:44:49,720
At high school I read "The
Eighty Yard Run."

818
00:44:49,925 --> 00:44:52,917
And I wept. Cried in class.

819
00:44:53,205 --> 00:44:55,002
That story made
me want to write.

820
00:44:55,205 --> 00:44:57,480
That and some
pieces by Saroyan.

821
00:44:57,685 --> 00:44:59,357
You love him too?

822
00:44:59,565 --> 00:45:01,715
Amazing! I love the plays
and the essays.

823
00:45:01,925 --> 00:45:05,634
When I think of Irwin Shaw, I
think of "Girls in Summer Dresses."

824
00:45:05,845 --> 00:45:08,439
The title is better than most
people's short stories.

825
00:45:08,645 --> 00:45:10,636
It's so elegant, economic.

826
00:45:10,925 --> 00:45:12,517
- It's thrilling.
- The best.

827
00:45:12,725 --> 00:45:14,556
Thrilling prose. Terrific.

828
00:45:15,525 --> 00:45:18,517
My book is about the values
of a society gone astray...

829
00:45:18,725 --> 00:45:20,602
a culture badly
in need of help.

830
00:45:20,805 --> 00:45:23,365
A country that gives a 20-year-old
kid who can barely read or write...

831
00:45:23,565 --> 00:45:25,874
a $100 million contract
to play basketball?

832
00:45:26,085 --> 00:45:29,555
And a brutal murder trial, or who
is sleeping with the President...

833
00:45:29,765 --> 00:45:32,677
It's all show business!
All show business!

834
00:45:32,885 --> 00:45:34,443
Why am I getting so shrill?

835
00:45:34,645 --> 00:45:36,761
I get so nervous
talking about my novel.

836
00:45:36,965 --> 00:45:38,523
That's why you have to finish it.

837
00:45:38,725 --> 00:45:40,920
- You're so encouraging.
- Screenplays have their place.

838
00:45:41,125 --> 00:45:42,683
But there's nothing like a
serious book.

839
00:45:42,885 --> 00:45:43,556
Exactly my point.

840
00:45:43,765 --> 00:45:45,437
In "Red Letter Day",
my first book...

841
00:45:45,645 --> 00:45:47,681
I touched on these themes,
but I was too green.

842
00:45:47,885 --> 00:45:50,115
- I remember "Red Letter Day".
- Really?

843
00:45:50,325 --> 00:45:52,236
Yeah, I reviewed it for
the Times.

844
00:45:52,445 --> 00:45:53,434
It was...

845
00:45:53,925 --> 00:45:55,324
extremely...

846
00:45:56,085 --> 00:45:58,394
half-baked,
laboured...

847
00:45:58,725 --> 00:45:59,840
solipsistic.

848
00:46:00,365 --> 00:46:02,560
There was no energy.
It was trivial.

849
00:46:03,165 --> 00:46:05,156
You don't mind
my being frank?

850
00:46:07,045 --> 00:46:08,478
Are you okay?

851
00:46:11,325 --> 00:46:13,361
The rest of them
will be here soon.

852
00:46:13,445 --> 00:46:16,721
Let's not take all day on this.
Move it along! I've got plans.

853
00:46:16,965 --> 00:46:19,877
- This way, Mr Adelman.
- Counselor! Nice to have you back.

854
00:46:20,085 --> 00:46:22,394
- It's a pleasure.
- Put him in the Green Room.

855
00:46:22,605 --> 00:46:25,802
You're from the ACLU, right?
Can I get you anything?

856
00:46:26,125 --> 00:46:28,878
Yeah. I'm expecting a call.
Can you put it through?

857
00:46:29,125 --> 00:46:30,160
Of course. You know each other?

858
00:46:30,365 --> 00:46:32,321
These gentleman are from the
South Carolina Klan.

859
00:46:32,565 --> 00:46:34,874
We've done a few
shows together.

860
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,558
You're Minister Polynice!

861
00:46:36,925 --> 00:46:38,881
The others are in
the Green Room.

862
00:46:39,085 --> 00:46:40,882
Is there time
for a sandwich?

863
00:46:41,085 --> 00:46:42,404
Of course, Mary...?

864
00:46:42,645 --> 00:46:45,079
- Can I see you in my office?
- Just a minute. Mary...

865
00:46:45,285 --> 00:46:46,479
Margaret, I'm so sorry...

866
00:46:46,685 --> 00:46:49,358
The attorney is
expecting a call...

867
00:46:49,565 --> 00:46:51,681
- Hi, I'm Dawn Dawson.
- Dawn Dawson?

868
00:46:51,885 --> 00:46:55,002
The teenage obese acrobat.
I had an appointment today.

869
00:46:55,845 --> 00:46:57,756
The teenage obese acrobat, today?

870
00:46:58,325 --> 00:47:00,361
- You said the 14th.
- Our "Overweight Achievers."

871
00:47:00,565 --> 00:47:02,476
Oh my God! I gave
out the wrong date!

872
00:47:02,685 --> 00:47:04,243
- You said the 14th.
- I am so sorry.

873
00:47:04,445 --> 00:47:06,640
Excuse me, the
skinheads are here.

874
00:47:06,845 --> 00:47:08,517
Green Room's
getting crowded.

875
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:11,444
How about the lounge?
With Rabbi Kaufman.

876
00:47:11,645 --> 00:47:15,001
That'd be nice. It's just
round the corner.

877
00:47:15,885 --> 00:47:19,241
How about makeup? I'm a lawyer,
I can't appear without makeup!

878
00:47:20,885 --> 00:47:22,034
It's a madhouse.

879
00:47:22,245 --> 00:47:25,203
I've made a mistake. I
gave out wrong dates.

880
00:47:25,645 --> 00:47:27,875
- Come here.
- I'm so sorry.

881
00:47:28,085 --> 00:47:29,643
I screwed up. I'm so sorry.

882
00:47:29,885 --> 00:47:32,877
I've been watching you run
up and down all morning...

883
00:47:33,125 --> 00:47:35,081
and I can't take my eyes off you.

884
00:47:35,325 --> 00:47:38,601
I can't get the
weekend in Bermuda...

885
00:47:38,845 --> 00:47:39,675
out of my mind.

886
00:47:39,885 --> 00:47:41,238
There's lots to do.

887
00:47:41,445 --> 00:47:43,436
Priorities. Never
confuse...

888
00:47:43,805 --> 00:47:45,238
priorities.

889
00:47:45,925 --> 00:47:47,074
Oh my God!

890
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:51,639
I'm Professor Benz. We're
here for the taping.

891
00:47:51,845 --> 00:47:53,642
I'm sorry, there's
been a mistake.

892
00:47:53,845 --> 00:47:57,281
Sorry. "Overweight Achievers"
is next week.

893
00:47:57,845 --> 00:47:58,800
Sorry.

894
00:47:59,365 --> 00:48:01,720
- Who are you?
- Lou DeMarco.

895
00:48:01,965 --> 00:48:02,875
Who?

896
00:48:03,285 --> 00:48:06,721
Uncle to Tony Lipriano from
the Genovese family, that's who.

897
00:48:07,005 --> 00:48:09,883
Our "Cosa Nostra"
show is next week.

898
00:48:10,205 --> 00:48:11,240
She told me today!

899
00:48:11,445 --> 00:48:13,003
I know, I'm sorry.

900
00:48:13,205 --> 00:48:16,277
I can't come next week.
I'm being deported Thursday.

901
00:48:19,485 --> 00:48:21,441
Didn't we do Sally's
show together?

902
00:48:21,645 --> 00:48:24,364
Going back a long time. I
only had 2 murders then.

903
00:48:24,565 --> 00:48:26,874
You're with William Morris?
Don't make me laugh!

904
00:48:27,085 --> 00:48:29,804
Where are the bagels? Have the
skinheads eaten them all?

905
00:48:33,325 --> 00:48:35,361
Could you interview this
professional woman...

906
00:48:35,725 --> 00:48:38,034
for the panel on lovemaking
next Tuesday?

907
00:48:38,245 --> 00:48:40,236
What's the show
called?

908
00:48:40,445 --> 00:48:43,357
"Working Girls Born in
Manhattan." I'm Nina.

909
00:48:43,565 --> 00:48:45,396
Nina, right. Great.

910
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:46,875
Bye.

911
00:48:47,085 --> 00:48:49,121
So you're a hooker.

912
00:48:49,565 --> 00:48:50,839
Yeah, that's right.

913
00:48:52,405 --> 00:48:54,873
Hey, Tony, you
finally got here.

914
00:48:55,125 --> 00:48:56,558
Traffic that bad?

915
00:48:56,845 --> 00:48:59,484
Told you it'd be heavy
traffic. I knew it.

916
00:48:59,765 --> 00:49:02,996
Grandma, look who's here!
Your favourite grandson!

917
00:49:03,245 --> 00:49:05,520
- Hi Tony.
- Hi, Grandma.

918
00:49:06,805 --> 00:49:08,636
God, we were waiting for you.

919
00:49:08,885 --> 00:49:11,319
- Where have you been?
- This is Robin, everybody.

920
00:49:11,645 --> 00:49:12,634
How do you do?

921
00:49:14,245 --> 00:49:15,837
This is my sister, Iris.

922
00:49:17,805 --> 00:49:19,841
- Tony's a real doll.
- I know.

923
00:49:20,125 --> 00:49:21,877
He got us this house.
Show her the house.

924
00:49:22,085 --> 00:49:23,313
Mom, will you stop it?

925
00:49:23,725 --> 00:49:27,559
But there's a waiting list to get
Grandpa into the nursing home.

926
00:49:28,085 --> 00:49:31,157
It's the only home I trust.
The others are toilets.

927
00:49:31,365 --> 00:49:34,994
But this one, he'd be looked after.
But there's a waiting list.

928
00:49:35,565 --> 00:49:39,319
So maybe if you call and we'd tell
him it's for you, for Grandpa.

929
00:49:39,765 --> 00:49:41,164
Use your name.

930
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:44,596
Maybe they'd move him up on
the list. Know what I mean?

931
00:49:44,845 --> 00:49:47,359
- We could try, Pop.
- Thanks. He needs it.

932
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:49,838
Talk to him about the table.

933
00:49:50,085 --> 00:49:51,120
Your Grandma!

934
00:49:51,325 --> 00:49:54,840
I want to take Iris to LeBijou
for her birthday.

935
00:49:55,085 --> 00:49:58,441
It's impossible to get
a good table there.

936
00:49:58,885 --> 00:50:01,877
There's a 6-month waiting
list for this restaurant.

937
00:50:02,085 --> 00:50:05,157
- I'll have Mary make the call.
- As long as it's convenient.

938
00:50:05,365 --> 00:50:07,196
Tony's nobody's fool.

939
00:50:07,405 --> 00:50:10,363
When will you get my Knick's
season tickets upgraded?

940
00:50:10,565 --> 00:50:12,521
What am I, Don
Corleone here?

941
00:50:13,125 --> 00:50:15,241
Not for me, brother,
for your nephew.

942
00:50:15,525 --> 00:50:17,595
Ricky! Come here.

943
00:50:18,085 --> 00:50:20,474
Tell Grandma who came
and spoke at your school.

944
00:50:20,765 --> 00:50:23,279
- A guest speaker?
- Yeah, John Brennan.

945
00:50:23,565 --> 00:50:25,601
- Very nice!
- The hostage guy.

946
00:50:25,805 --> 00:50:27,477
- You don't know John Brennan?
- The hostage, Grandma.

947
00:50:27,685 --> 00:50:30,438
- You remember!
- No, I never heard of him.

948
00:50:30,685 --> 00:50:34,234
They hijacked his plane and
held him hostage for months.

949
00:50:34,445 --> 00:50:35,514
Grandma won't know.

950
00:50:35,725 --> 00:50:39,001
- Yes she does. Dad, you remember?
- Sure. It was in the papers.

951
00:50:39,205 --> 00:50:41,765
In the papers, on the
television, everything.

952
00:50:41,965 --> 00:50:45,321
They released him and he got this
hero's welcome. He's famous!

953
00:50:45,565 --> 00:50:48,033
Famous? For being
captured?

954
00:50:49,605 --> 00:50:52,995
Why's he a hero? It's no
feat to get captured!

955
00:50:53,965 --> 00:50:56,035
Your family's crazy about you.

956
00:50:56,405 --> 00:50:58,475
They've never had much...

957
00:50:58,765 --> 00:51:01,438
and my success has made
so many things possible.

958
00:51:01,685 --> 00:51:04,074
That's why I'm so
driven professionally.

959
00:51:04,285 --> 00:51:05,877
Yeah, they're lovely.

960
00:51:06,085 --> 00:51:09,282
It's fun to be able to do things
for people you love.

961
00:51:09,485 --> 00:51:12,682
Did you never think you might
want a family of your own?

962
00:51:12,925 --> 00:51:16,201
Yeah. I'm surprised you
don't have one.

963
00:51:16,445 --> 00:51:17,719
Well, you know...

964
00:51:17,965 --> 00:51:21,162
At the beginning we were
young, not much money.

965
00:51:22,085 --> 00:51:25,794
And as time went on, Lee became
edgy if I brought it up.

966
00:51:26,885 --> 00:51:30,116
Would you like to have a family
if we ever got married?

967
00:51:31,485 --> 00:51:32,554
Well, you know...

968
00:51:33,885 --> 00:51:36,683
- When's the other shoe gonna drop?
- What do you mean?

969
00:51:36,965 --> 00:51:38,114
Well, you know...

970
00:51:38,405 --> 00:51:39,554
I mean...

971
00:51:40,405 --> 00:51:42,441
you can't be this perfect.

972
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:46,513
You didn't just walk into my
life with no drawbacks.

973
00:51:47,165 --> 00:51:50,077
Any minute I'm gonna
discover you have a wife.

974
00:51:50,325 --> 00:51:53,283
Or you had one, but you chopped
her up with a hatchet.

975
00:52:01,125 --> 00:52:03,639
Don't walk away from
me like that!

976
00:52:03,885 --> 00:52:06,319
- Get back in there!
- Go to hell!

977
00:52:06,565 --> 00:52:10,114
It's all your fucking lying!
Get her out of your life!

978
00:52:10,485 --> 00:52:14,194
You want to fucking
ruin our relationship?

979
00:52:14,765 --> 00:52:15,914
Stupid bitch!

980
00:52:16,165 --> 00:52:18,121
I'm fucking sick
of this bullshit!

981
00:52:18,325 --> 00:52:19,917
I'm sick of this bullshit!

982
00:52:20,125 --> 00:52:21,444
Fuck you!

983
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:23,155
Stop it!

984
00:52:23,365 --> 00:52:24,957
Tell her to get out of our lives!

985
00:52:25,205 --> 00:52:27,844
I'm sick of it!
Tired of this bullshit!

986
00:52:28,085 --> 00:52:29,962
- I can't take it anymore!
- You're so paranoid!

987
00:52:30,165 --> 00:52:31,757
I fucking love you!

988
00:52:31,965 --> 00:52:34,525
Tell her to get the fuck
out of our lives!

989
00:52:34,805 --> 00:52:37,956
Listen, baby, I love you.
Don't do this to me, alright?

990
00:52:38,205 --> 00:52:39,718
Don't you fucking do this.

991
00:52:42,405 --> 00:52:43,963
Don't you fucking walk away.

992
00:52:44,205 --> 00:52:47,038
Don't fucking walk away
from me, bitch!

993
00:52:48,285 --> 00:52:49,957
There's a terrible fight
on the 11th floor.

994
00:52:50,165 --> 00:52:50,995
A fight?

995
00:52:51,205 --> 00:52:52,479
- Where?
- 1102.

996
00:52:52,685 --> 00:52:54,357
- Brandon Darrow.
- Every time.

997
00:52:54,565 --> 00:52:56,521
He seemed drunk,
so I called security.

998
00:52:56,725 --> 00:52:59,080
- Call the police.
- Somebody'll get hurt.

999
00:52:59,325 --> 00:53:00,553
Come on, hurry!

1000
00:53:00,805 --> 00:53:02,284
He's trying to hurt me!

1001
00:53:02,925 --> 00:53:04,199
Get in there.

1002
00:53:06,285 --> 00:53:08,401
- What's going on here?
- Get the fuck out.

1003
00:53:08,605 --> 00:53:10,800
I don't know what that bitch
told you, but she's lying.

1004
00:53:11,005 --> 00:53:13,360
- I'm security.
- I'll call my lawyer...

1005
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:15,521
if you don't get
the fuck out of here.

1006
00:53:16,165 --> 00:53:19,362
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Tried to push me out the window!

1007
00:53:19,565 --> 00:53:21,157
Bitch, don't you lie to them!

1008
00:53:21,485 --> 00:53:22,804
Don't you fucking lie!

1009
00:53:23,205 --> 00:53:24,843
- Keep him away!
- Take it easy, pal.

1010
00:53:25,045 --> 00:53:26,876
Get your fucking
hands off me.

1011
00:53:27,325 --> 00:53:28,724
Easy, pal!

1012
00:53:29,525 --> 00:53:31,595
Excuse me, I have an
appointment with Mr Darrow.

1013
00:53:31,805 --> 00:53:33,955
Get off my neck!
I hate this hotel!

1014
00:53:34,165 --> 00:53:36,725
- I told you, she's lying!
- I'm Lee Simon, about the script.

1015
00:53:36,925 --> 00:53:39,075
If your friend tries to
plant coke on me again...

1016
00:53:39,285 --> 00:53:40,798
you don't know what I'll do!

1017
00:53:41,005 --> 00:53:43,758
- Lee Simon. I wrote "Heist".
- What the fuck you want?

1018
00:53:43,965 --> 00:53:47,241
He tried to throw me and
my clothes out the window!

1019
00:53:47,445 --> 00:53:51,120
Don't bullshit strangers.
And I'm not high. Look at me.

1020
00:53:51,525 --> 00:53:55,359
- I don't make moral judgements.
- What was your name?

1021
00:53:55,885 --> 00:53:58,604
Nicole Oliver gave you my script.
About an armoured car robbery.

1022
00:53:58,805 --> 00:54:01,797
- It has a strong personal subplot.
- I'm gonna sue you motherfuckers!

1023
00:54:02,045 --> 00:54:05,117
I'll sue this fleabag, fucking
cockroach hotel!

1024
00:54:05,365 --> 00:54:07,481
- What's going on here?
- I'm sick of this!

1025
00:54:07,685 --> 00:54:09,676
Time I got a little
respect round here!

1026
00:54:09,885 --> 00:54:11,637
- Shut up!
- Fuck you!

1027
00:54:11,885 --> 00:54:12,920
Shut the hell up!

1028
00:54:13,165 --> 00:54:16,043
Little domestic problem,
but it got pretty physical.

1029
00:54:16,245 --> 00:54:18,839
- I see your films.
- Tried to push me out the window!

1030
00:54:19,125 --> 00:54:21,480
- This guy?
- Her friend planted dope on me!

1031
00:54:21,765 --> 00:54:23,198
Come on, let's go downtown.

1032
00:54:23,405 --> 00:54:25,123
Talk to my people.

1033
00:54:25,365 --> 00:54:28,038
- Who are you?
- Lee Simon. We have a meeting.

1034
00:54:28,245 --> 00:54:29,598
Not right now. Later maybe.

1035
00:54:29,805 --> 00:54:32,114
Thing is, we had
a meeting scheduled...

1036
00:54:32,325 --> 00:54:34,236
and it's important
that we meet.

1037
00:54:34,525 --> 00:54:35,924
30 seconds would help.

1038
00:54:36,765 --> 00:54:38,835
Come on, ladies, back up!

1039
00:54:39,085 --> 00:54:41,645
Initially, we can have a
brief conversation...

1040
00:54:41,845 --> 00:54:43,563
and establish what we need.

1041
00:54:43,805 --> 00:54:45,033
Can we get these guys back?

1042
00:54:45,325 --> 00:54:46,553
Will this take long?

1043
00:54:46,765 --> 00:54:48,244
- Out the way!
- Make room!

1044
00:54:48,445 --> 00:54:50,754
Is tomorrow good for you?
A week?

1045
00:54:50,965 --> 00:54:52,114
Clear the way!

1046
00:54:53,925 --> 00:54:56,439
Wait! Don't take him away!

1047
00:54:57,125 --> 00:55:00,800
Lt'll be okay, baby. Call Irv
Klein, get him downtown.

1048
00:55:01,005 --> 00:55:03,075
- I'll be out in an hour.
- Hold 'em back!

1049
00:55:03,285 --> 00:55:06,004
He didn't do anything.
I'm not pressing charges!

1050
00:55:06,205 --> 00:55:09,003
Don't hold him. The hotel
has no problem with this.

1051
00:55:09,205 --> 00:55:11,275
I brought a copy
if you want to talk.

1052
00:55:11,525 --> 00:55:13,436
Mr Darrow, you're welcome
back in the hotel.

1053
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:15,960
Okay, because this is Brandon
Darrow, understand?

1054
00:55:16,165 --> 00:55:18,121
That's the only reason.

1055
00:55:18,485 --> 00:55:20,123
- That's it!
- Thank you very much.

1056
00:55:20,325 --> 00:55:22,043
Mr Darrow, come back to the hotel.

1057
00:55:22,565 --> 00:55:24,476
Stay outside, please!

1058
00:55:24,805 --> 00:55:26,955
You're not allowed
in the hotel.

1059
00:55:27,245 --> 00:55:29,839
If we could go into the bar
and have a drink...

1060
00:55:30,205 --> 00:55:32,799
and talk for a few minutes,
there's some points...

1061
00:55:33,045 --> 00:55:36,401
I'm reworking which
you'd be excited to hear.

1062
00:55:36,685 --> 00:55:39,643
- I'm open to the whole process.
- For my wife.

1063
00:55:39,845 --> 00:55:41,836
In just a brief
discussion, I think...

1064
00:55:42,085 --> 00:55:43,882
Brandon, we'll be late!

1065
00:55:44,205 --> 00:55:46,196
This is the first script I've
read with balls.

1066
00:55:49,045 --> 00:55:51,479
- Is it 5 already?
- I had a lot of interest in it.

1067
00:55:51,685 --> 00:55:53,721
But it's always,
"Get a bankable star."

1068
00:55:53,925 --> 00:55:55,995
Absolutely.
We have to talk.

1069
00:55:56,205 --> 00:55:58,594
You as Sonnyboy, with
an unknown for the female lead.

1070
00:55:58,805 --> 00:56:00,636
- You like fights?
- Fights?

1071
00:56:00,845 --> 00:56:03,518
We're going to Atlantic City to
see the Fernandez-Tobin fight.

1072
00:56:03,725 --> 00:56:06,285
- Atlantic City, now?
- Yeah, it's 5 already.

1073
00:56:06,485 --> 00:56:09,841
I have an assignment tonight.
We could talk now.

1074
00:56:10,045 --> 00:56:11,922
I get a lot of scripts.
I'm sure!

1075
00:56:12,125 --> 00:56:13,683
- But most are bullshit.
- Exactly!

1076
00:56:13,885 --> 00:56:15,796
- No fucking integrity!
- We gotta go.

1077
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:17,484
- Yours works.
- I'm flattered.

1078
00:56:17,685 --> 00:56:19,118
My assignment! 2 minutes!

1079
00:56:19,325 --> 00:56:21,634
Can't reschedule me.
I fly to Africa tomorrow.

1080
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:24,837
They went through hell to get me
an interview with the mayor's wife.

1081
00:56:25,045 --> 00:56:26,444
She likes acting.

1082
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:32,357
I got scratches all over my
arms. It's ridiculous.

1083
00:56:32,645 --> 00:56:34,124
Do we take off from Teterboro?

1084
00:56:35,445 --> 00:56:37,561
- From Teterboro.
- Take off?

1085
00:56:39,005 --> 00:56:41,314
- We can't drive now.
- Some music!

1086
00:56:41,525 --> 00:56:43,322
I can't fly.

1087
00:56:43,605 --> 00:56:46,039
I had a horrible experience
as a travel writer...

1088
00:56:46,245 --> 00:56:49,123
Don't be a fucking pussy.
Flight takes 20 minutes.

1089
00:56:49,405 --> 00:56:50,997
It was a crash landing.

1090
00:56:51,205 --> 00:56:53,594
- You like fights?
- Yes, but...

1091
00:56:53,805 --> 00:56:55,636
D'you like Fernandez
or Tobin?

1092
00:56:55,925 --> 00:56:57,278
Tobin's got him, man!

1093
00:56:57,845 --> 00:57:00,643
- Tobin's got him!
- I like Fernandez.

1094
00:57:00,925 --> 00:57:02,324
I'm impressed with your ear.

1095
00:57:02,525 --> 00:57:04,277
- My ear?
- Yeah, dialogue.

1096
00:57:04,485 --> 00:57:06,635
My ear! Well, I try and listen.

1097
00:57:06,925 --> 00:57:09,234
Know what I mean?
It flows.

1098
00:57:17,885 --> 00:57:19,238
Come on, come on!

1099
00:57:19,965 --> 00:57:21,239
Come on, baby!

1100
00:57:22,045 --> 00:57:24,115
Stick him! Come on!

1101
00:57:24,445 --> 00:57:27,357
Is this a good time to go
over script problems?

1102
00:57:27,565 --> 00:57:31,035
He can't put a fucking
combination together, shit!

1103
00:57:33,645 --> 00:57:36,079
Let's shoot craps.
I can't sit still.

1104
00:57:36,285 --> 00:57:39,197
If we could get our business
done, you could play more relaxed.

1105
00:57:39,485 --> 00:57:41,476
- You shoot crap?
- I don't, no.

1106
00:57:41,685 --> 00:57:42,834
I'll teach you, man!

1107
00:57:43,045 --> 00:57:46,117
I know the rules, but I
didn't bring much money.

1108
00:57:46,365 --> 00:57:48,037
I'll advance you some.

1109
00:57:48,245 --> 00:57:50,076
From our royalties?
Very generous.

1110
00:57:50,325 --> 00:57:52,395
I wanted to talk
about the opening.

1111
00:57:52,605 --> 00:57:54,641
You know? It
feels a little rushed.

1112
00:57:54,885 --> 00:57:57,797
It's definitely rushed.
Needs more build-up.

1113
00:57:58,125 --> 00:57:59,922
- No, not build-up.
- Not build-up!

1114
00:58:00,125 --> 00:58:01,478
Character development.

1115
00:58:01,685 --> 00:58:04,677
Who is this Sonnyboy?
Why's he need to score so bad?

1116
00:58:04,885 --> 00:58:06,364
You have a feel for this.

1117
00:58:06,925 --> 00:58:08,324
Shoot 'em, babe!

1118
00:58:11,725 --> 00:58:13,716
You're fucking cursed.
It ain't your night.

1119
00:58:14,085 --> 00:58:17,634
I can't believe I ran
through $6,000 so fast.

1120
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:21,964
All right, seven or eleven!
Gimme the dice!

1121
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:23,917
Seven or eleven, baby!

1122
00:58:24,645 --> 00:58:27,603
You know after the opening
scene, when Sonnyboy meets...

1123
00:58:35,205 --> 00:58:37,400
Hey man, you partake in this?

1124
00:58:37,885 --> 00:58:41,116
Well I have some alcohol,
so... not really.

1125
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:45,594
So I was wondering how you felt
about how I handled the robbery.

1126
00:58:45,805 --> 00:58:47,841
It's a terrific sequence,
I'm very happy...

1127
00:58:48,045 --> 00:58:49,717
Needs a complete rewrite.

1128
00:58:49,925 --> 00:58:53,122
Nobody'd believe you could steal
an armoured car in the daytime.

1129
00:58:53,325 --> 00:58:55,793
- It's ridiculous.
- Not enough subterfuge.

1130
00:58:57,005 --> 00:58:58,404
For you, baby.

1131
00:58:59,565 --> 00:59:00,884
Hey, you like her?

1132
00:59:01,085 --> 00:59:03,599
- She's a terrific person.
- Got a nice ass.

1133
00:59:03,805 --> 00:59:06,683
With some helicopter
shots, we could...

1134
00:59:06,885 --> 00:59:08,716
Let's take the party inside,
what d'you say?

1135
00:59:08,925 --> 00:59:11,883
I'd like to talk more in-depth
about the denouement...

1136
00:59:12,125 --> 00:59:15,083
I feel there's a chance there
to say something special.

1137
00:59:20,885 --> 00:59:23,558
Excuse me, Brandon, we
can finish this in a second.

1138
00:59:23,765 --> 00:59:25,517
I don't want to
get in the way, so...

1139
00:59:25,725 --> 00:59:27,522
Why don't you get into bed...

1140
00:59:27,725 --> 00:59:29,841
and we'll be there
in a minute, right?

1141
00:59:30,165 --> 00:59:32,042
Excuse me, have
you got a second?

1142
00:59:32,245 --> 00:59:33,883
This is an unfamiliar
scenario to me.

1143
00:59:34,085 --> 00:59:35,837
Listen, I know Gina
from before.

1144
00:59:36,045 --> 00:59:38,275
You won't be sorry. Trust me.

1145
00:59:39,005 --> 00:59:41,724
- You mean, all of us?
- Yeah, what's the problem?

1146
00:59:41,925 --> 00:59:44,314
You never been with more
than two broads before?

1147
00:59:44,525 --> 00:59:46,959
The woman thing is
not a... you know.

1148
00:59:47,205 --> 00:59:48,923
But with guys I'm uncomfortable.

1149
00:59:49,165 --> 00:59:51,474
But we're not
getting together, right?

1150
00:59:51,725 --> 00:59:53,283
You do like women, don't you?

1151
00:59:53,485 --> 00:59:54,918
If it was, like on their own...

1152
00:59:55,125 --> 00:59:57,923
with just 2, 5, 500, it
wouldn't matter, but...

1153
00:59:58,125 --> 00:59:59,638
So my presence disturbs you?

1154
00:59:59,845 --> 01:00:02,234
You know, the idea of a naked
man per se, conceptually...

1155
01:00:02,485 --> 01:00:05,124
a naked man is
not an issue for me.

1156
01:00:05,325 --> 01:00:08,601
- Do we need the door closed?
- Ever been in a boy's locker room?

1157
01:00:08,805 --> 01:00:11,080
Sure. I have
track medals.

1158
01:00:11,285 --> 01:00:12,604
I was all-city.

1159
01:00:12,805 --> 01:00:14,443
So what's the problem?

1160
01:00:14,645 --> 01:00:16,203
I don't know how to put it.

1161
01:00:16,445 --> 01:00:19,881
It's a wave of panic at the
proximity of male genitalia...

1162
01:00:20,125 --> 01:00:22,081
in conjunction with the
specific activity implied.

1163
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:23,957
Add to which, I'm still airsick.

1164
01:00:24,165 --> 01:00:25,314
I don't know if I can...

1165
01:00:25,525 --> 01:00:27,436
You writers are
so sensitive, you know?

1166
01:00:27,645 --> 01:00:29,715
You should be writing
greeting cards, not scripts.

1167
01:00:43,725 --> 01:00:45,841
What's up?
Not in the mood?

1168
01:00:46,125 --> 01:00:47,114
I'm just...

1169
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:48,754
I don't know...

1170
01:00:49,045 --> 01:00:51,957
tired, you know. Drunk.
Just had alcohol.

1171
01:00:53,605 --> 01:00:56,278
Brandon tells me
you're his writer.

1172
01:00:56,605 --> 01:00:58,038
Well, y'know, I'm a writer.

1173
01:00:59,085 --> 01:01:00,074
I write.

1174
01:01:00,405 --> 01:01:01,997
I wrote some film scripts.

1175
01:01:02,245 --> 01:01:03,234
Really?

1176
01:01:03,485 --> 01:01:05,362
Ever heard of Chekhov?

1177
01:01:05,925 --> 01:01:06,801
I have.

1178
01:01:07,005 --> 01:01:08,563
I write like him.

1179
01:01:09,405 --> 01:01:10,804
You write like him?

1180
01:01:22,405 --> 01:01:24,441
So Brandon, the scene
in the church...

1181
01:01:24,645 --> 01:01:27,876
where Sonnyboy's killed by his
brother? Does that work?

1182
01:01:28,245 --> 01:01:31,157
Listen, we'll definitely
speak about this again.

1183
01:01:31,365 --> 01:01:34,323
I'm going to Africa tomorrow to
do a pretty complicated picture...

1184
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:38,240
and then I have another picture in
L.A., and then maybe we can talk.

1185
01:01:38,685 --> 01:01:40,755
But I really want
to do your script.

1186
01:01:41,045 --> 01:01:42,876
It just needs a little
bit of work.

1187
01:01:43,205 --> 01:01:45,082
I need to think about it.
Know what I mean?

1188
01:01:45,325 --> 01:01:46,917
Have a great drive
back to New York.

1189
01:01:47,125 --> 01:01:49,514
My agent will call
you about the $6,000.

1190
01:01:49,725 --> 01:01:53,240
You can pay it back in
installments. He'll call you.

1191
01:01:54,565 --> 01:01:56,283
Yeah, Bonnie?

1192
01:01:57,205 --> 01:01:58,638
You sitting down?

1193
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:00,557
No, I just...

1194
01:02:01,205 --> 01:02:03,321
I guess I just woke up.

1195
01:02:04,765 --> 01:02:07,120
I've decided to
finish my novel.

1196
01:02:07,725 --> 01:02:09,238
Yeah, I know, I know.

1197
01:02:09,525 --> 01:02:12,198
No, I won't let anything stand
in my way, I'll work...

1198
01:02:12,445 --> 01:02:15,915
nights, weekends,
whatever it takes.

1199
01:02:16,125 --> 01:02:17,319
Well, I came home...

1200
01:02:17,565 --> 01:02:21,080
and looked for the chapters I'd
written, but I couldn't find them.

1201
01:02:22,725 --> 01:02:26,081
And I thought, "God, maybe I've
thrown them out by mistake!"

1202
01:02:26,285 --> 01:02:28,276
And I panicked. Panicked!

1203
01:02:28,965 --> 01:02:30,557
No, then I found them.

1204
01:02:30,765 --> 01:02:32,357
My God, but that panic!

1205
01:02:32,685 --> 01:02:34,755
It just made me realise...

1206
01:02:35,405 --> 01:02:37,361
how dear they are to me.

1207
01:02:37,925 --> 01:02:41,281
So I reread them
and I just...

1208
01:02:41,765 --> 01:02:43,517
Well, they contain...

1209
01:02:44,125 --> 01:02:46,639
every aspiration
I've ever had...

1210
01:02:47,125 --> 01:02:49,434
every authentic
feeling...

1211
01:02:49,725 --> 01:02:51,124
every idea.

1212
01:02:51,325 --> 01:02:53,361
And I just got no choice.

1213
01:02:53,605 --> 01:02:55,835
I have to complete this.
This is me.

1214
01:02:57,245 --> 01:02:58,963
I love this book.

1215
01:02:59,205 --> 01:03:00,718
I love this book.

1216
01:03:02,925 --> 01:03:04,358
Well, thank you.

1217
01:03:25,245 --> 01:03:26,758
Come on in.

1218
01:03:27,605 --> 01:03:29,038
Are you okay?

1219
01:03:29,725 --> 01:03:31,636
You seemed tense
on the phone.

1220
01:03:32,165 --> 01:03:33,757
Yeah, come in. Want a drink?

1221
01:03:34,005 --> 01:03:35,518
Well, I wouldn't mind.

1222
01:03:35,765 --> 01:03:37,881
Some white wine,
if you have it.

1223
01:03:42,565 --> 01:03:43,998
So let me explain.

1224
01:03:44,605 --> 01:03:47,677
When we spoke
after the show...

1225
01:03:48,685 --> 01:03:52,234
we touched lightly on,
for want of a better term...

1226
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:54,638
sexual technique.

1227
01:03:55,245 --> 01:03:56,394
Do you recall?

1228
01:03:57,485 --> 01:03:59,840
Certain strategies for...

1229
01:04:00,805 --> 01:04:02,204
pleasing a man in bed.

1230
01:04:04,765 --> 01:04:06,483
I don't know why...

1231
01:04:07,205 --> 01:04:08,923
I'm so rattled.

1232
01:04:09,165 --> 01:04:11,838
I said this so clearly on my
pillow last night...

1233
01:04:12,085 --> 01:04:14,997
- and now I'm all disjointed.
- Have some more wine.

1234
01:04:17,845 --> 01:04:20,075
I want you to show
me some things.

1235
01:04:20,285 --> 01:04:21,274
On television?

1236
01:04:21,485 --> 01:04:22,634
No, for me.

1237
01:04:22,965 --> 01:04:24,034
Personally.

1238
01:04:24,925 --> 01:04:26,517
Let me explain.

1239
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:29,684
The man I'm going with...

1240
01:04:29,925 --> 01:04:31,802
whom I love
very dearly...

1241
01:04:32,445 --> 01:04:34,003
is very sexually active.

1242
01:04:34,205 --> 01:04:35,558
Which is great.

1243
01:04:35,765 --> 01:04:36,993
You know, great!

1244
01:04:37,245 --> 01:04:39,361
Our sex life...

1245
01:04:39,605 --> 01:04:42,073
is very solid and physical.

1246
01:04:42,285 --> 01:04:44,480
Well, obviously physical!

1247
01:04:44,685 --> 01:04:47,040
And the sad truth is...

1248
01:04:47,285 --> 01:04:48,354
Well, no.

1249
01:04:48,725 --> 01:04:50,841
I only recently
got divorced...

1250
01:04:51,085 --> 01:04:53,280
after being married to the same
man since I was in college...

1251
01:04:53,525 --> 01:04:54,878
whom I loved...

1252
01:04:55,205 --> 01:04:57,321
but who was all I'd
experienced.

1253
01:04:57,805 --> 01:04:59,238
I say this...

1254
01:04:59,565 --> 01:05:03,035
confidentially, because I
respect you professionally.

1255
01:05:04,245 --> 01:05:08,033
I think I disappointed
him sexually.

1256
01:05:08,765 --> 01:05:10,835
I come from a very
uptight...

1257
01:05:11,045 --> 01:05:12,478
proper family...

1258
01:05:12,765 --> 01:05:14,562
and I was taught...

1259
01:05:15,365 --> 01:05:16,798
growing up...

1260
01:05:17,005 --> 01:05:20,156
that a lot of acts of
lovemaking are wrong.

1261
01:05:20,405 --> 01:05:22,043
In my mother's eyes, actually...

1262
01:05:22,245 --> 01:05:23,439
quite sinful.

1263
01:05:23,965 --> 01:05:25,318
And so...

1264
01:05:26,885 --> 01:05:28,716
I went to a Catholic
school, you know?

1265
01:05:29,525 --> 01:05:32,756
Not that Tony
complains, but I feel...

1266
01:05:33,845 --> 01:05:35,517
that I'm not really...

1267
01:05:36,645 --> 01:05:38,283
that he's being kind.

1268
01:05:39,045 --> 01:05:41,798
And it's a testament to
his feelings for me...

1269
01:05:42,005 --> 01:05:45,281
that he desires me as much
as he does and enjoys it.

1270
01:05:45,485 --> 01:05:48,602
Don't get me wrong, we both
do. I love being wanted...

1271
01:05:48,805 --> 01:05:50,796
and the actual act itself.

1272
01:05:51,085 --> 01:05:52,598
But I just feel...

1273
01:05:54,485 --> 01:05:56,123
that I can do better.

1274
01:05:57,285 --> 01:05:59,401
And I want him to have the best.

1275
01:05:59,645 --> 01:06:02,364
I don't want him,
after a while...

1276
01:06:02,645 --> 01:06:04,715
to start wanting experiences
with other women.

1277
01:06:05,005 --> 01:06:06,996
I couldn't
take that again.

1278
01:06:07,205 --> 01:06:10,356
Is any of this making
sense to you?

1279
01:06:11,645 --> 01:06:12,361
Yeah.

1280
01:06:12,925 --> 01:06:15,075
So you what you
want is lessons.

1281
01:06:15,285 --> 01:06:16,684
I guess so, yeah.

1282
01:06:16,885 --> 01:06:19,604
I mean, I'm sure this
is highly unusual. Or not!

1283
01:06:19,805 --> 01:06:21,158
Of course you'll get paid.

1284
01:06:21,445 --> 01:06:23,561
Why not go to one
of those therapists?

1285
01:06:23,805 --> 01:06:24,920
No, no!

1286
01:06:25,165 --> 01:06:27,633
I don't want to get clinical
with Tony.

1287
01:06:28,005 --> 01:06:31,634
I wanted to learn it from someone
who'll teach it to me...

1288
01:06:31,965 --> 01:06:34,559
down and dirty! If you
know what I mean.

1289
01:06:34,845 --> 01:06:36,676
Just wondering where to begin.

1290
01:06:36,925 --> 01:06:38,438
How about oral sex?

1291
01:06:39,765 --> 01:06:42,074
Because, y'know, I sometimes feel...

1292
01:06:42,365 --> 01:06:44,925
it just doesn't
come naturally to me.

1293
01:06:45,365 --> 01:06:46,514
It's laboured.

1294
01:06:46,725 --> 01:06:48,681
I have trouble
breathing, actually.

1295
01:06:48,885 --> 01:06:52,560
And once a cap fell off my
tooth and I swallowed it.

1296
01:06:53,925 --> 01:06:55,597
Do you enjoy it?

1297
01:06:58,405 --> 01:07:00,202
I certainly don't mind it.

1298
01:07:00,925 --> 01:07:02,324
But do you enjoy it?

1299
01:07:02,725 --> 01:07:05,478
What goes through your
mind when you're doing it?

1300
01:07:06,725 --> 01:07:08,204
The Crucifixion.

1301
01:07:08,605 --> 01:07:11,165
I can't help it,
it's my upbringing.

1302
01:07:11,645 --> 01:07:12,873
All right, look...

1303
01:07:13,085 --> 01:07:15,280
show me how you do it.

1304
01:07:15,925 --> 01:07:17,199
- Go ahead.
- Now?

1305
01:07:17,405 --> 01:07:20,442
Yeah. Take the banana and
give me your best blowjob.

1306
01:07:20,725 --> 01:07:21,601
Go ahead.

1307
01:07:22,725 --> 01:07:24,875
Yeah, down the hatch.

1308
01:07:34,125 --> 01:07:35,558
Oh my God!

1309
01:07:36,005 --> 01:07:39,077
- Have you ever injured him?
- No. Is it too hard?

1310
01:07:39,325 --> 01:07:40,678
Well, it's a little...

1311
01:07:40,965 --> 01:07:42,318
You see, I'm overeager.

1312
01:07:42,605 --> 01:07:44,596
I just try too hard.

1313
01:07:44,925 --> 01:07:46,483
It's all right. I'll show you.

1314
01:07:46,805 --> 01:07:48,875
I'll show you how to do it.
Here you go. Watch me.

1315
01:07:49,125 --> 01:07:51,195
It's a gentle, slow,
medium-slow motion.

1316
01:07:51,445 --> 01:07:52,924
Get all you can in your mouth...

1317
01:07:53,125 --> 01:07:55,161
Depth of penetration is vital.

1318
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:57,236
Okay, watch this. Ready?

1319
01:08:13,005 --> 01:08:15,075
My God! Are you choking?

1320
01:08:15,365 --> 01:08:16,718
You're choking!

1321
01:08:18,045 --> 01:08:19,160
Oh my God!

1322
01:08:21,445 --> 01:08:22,878
Arms up!

1323
01:08:27,165 --> 01:08:29,474
My God! Put your
arms up again.

1324
01:08:29,925 --> 01:08:30,994
Thrust!

1325
01:08:32,245 --> 01:08:33,644
Is that out?

1326
01:08:34,365 --> 01:08:36,276
I am so sorry!

1327
01:08:37,045 --> 01:08:38,478
Do you want some water?

1328
01:08:38,925 --> 01:08:40,153
I'm okay, I'm okay.

1329
01:08:41,085 --> 01:08:43,679
I feel dreadful,
like it's my fault.

1330
01:08:43,925 --> 01:08:45,404
- It's all right.
- Are you okay?

1331
01:08:45,605 --> 01:08:46,515
Yeah, I'm all right.

1332
01:08:46,765 --> 01:08:48,244
Oh dear!

1333
01:08:51,205 --> 01:08:53,036
I need some more practice.

1334
01:08:53,485 --> 01:08:55,282
Should you be smoking?

1335
01:08:56,725 --> 01:08:58,078
Oh yeah! All right.

1336
01:09:01,925 --> 01:09:02,960
A toast...

1337
01:09:03,165 --> 01:09:04,518
to Sid Melnick!

1338
01:09:05,325 --> 01:09:08,954
And to the best book written
about the CIA in 10 years.

1339
01:09:10,805 --> 01:09:13,194
- Why's he so insecure?
- He's crazy.

1340
01:09:13,405 --> 01:09:15,839
- Feel like another drink?
- It would be good.

1341
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:17,837
- Can I refill you?
- Yes, refill me.

1342
01:09:18,085 --> 01:09:19,723
Keep an eye on him.

1343
01:09:20,405 --> 01:09:22,873
- Bonnie's terrific.
- And a wonderful editor.

1344
01:09:23,365 --> 01:09:26,994
I get the feeling she's controlling
the chaos you call your life.

1345
01:09:27,765 --> 01:09:29,164
I figured, "Fuck it!"

1346
01:09:29,405 --> 01:09:32,477
We've been practically living
together for the last 6 months.

1347
01:09:32,685 --> 01:09:34,198
So why not? I made
the commitment...

1348
01:09:34,405 --> 01:09:37,283
and so she gave up her place.
She moved in today.

1349
01:09:37,485 --> 01:09:40,318
Know what I hate about
promotional book tours?

1350
01:09:40,525 --> 01:09:42,436
You work your ass off...

1351
01:09:42,685 --> 01:09:44,835
knock yourself out,
then go to a bookstore...

1352
01:09:45,085 --> 01:09:46,313
they don't have your book.

1353
01:09:46,525 --> 01:09:48,755
- They never stock your book.
- I know.

1354
01:09:49,245 --> 01:09:52,362
The screenplay, the famous
screenplay, went nowhere.

1355
01:09:52,645 --> 01:09:55,876
You need a star and it's just
fucking death. The humiliation!

1356
01:09:56,085 --> 01:09:58,440
- Business.
- Total, y'know?

1357
01:10:00,245 --> 01:10:02,236
Why don't you tell them
what you've been doing?

1358
01:10:02,525 --> 01:10:04,516
- Oh, please!
- What?

1359
01:10:04,725 --> 01:10:07,159
- What is it?
- I've almost finished my novel.

1360
01:10:07,605 --> 01:10:08,799
Really?

1361
01:10:09,125 --> 01:10:11,878
I've been slaving over it for
a year in my spare time.

1362
01:10:12,165 --> 01:10:13,883
But with the reception
my previous books got...

1363
01:10:14,125 --> 01:10:15,763
I'm a glutton for
punishment, right?

1364
01:10:15,965 --> 01:10:19,241
- This'll be a huge success.
- He's being modest.

1365
01:10:19,645 --> 01:10:21,363
- It's great.
- You read it?

1366
01:10:21,565 --> 01:10:24,398
You're gonna go by my
new roommate now?

1367
01:10:24,605 --> 01:10:26,800
Because she has
no agenda here.

1368
01:10:34,365 --> 01:10:36,435
- How are you?
- Nice to see you.

1369
01:10:37,645 --> 01:10:39,203
I know these guys!

1370
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:40,918
- Lee, how you doing?
- Good to see you.

1371
01:10:41,125 --> 01:10:42,797
- Good to see you again.
- How you been?

1372
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:44,040
This is Nola.

1373
01:10:44,365 --> 01:10:46,356
That's Bonnie and Kevin.

1374
01:10:47,845 --> 01:10:49,119
That's Lee.

1375
01:10:49,845 --> 01:10:51,164
So, how are you?

1376
01:10:52,885 --> 01:10:54,034
Here we go.

1377
01:10:54,245 --> 01:10:56,236
Do you mind if...?
Thank you.

1378
01:10:57,405 --> 01:10:59,157
- How's it going?
- Very good.

1379
01:11:00,045 --> 01:11:01,239
So, how you doing?

1380
01:11:01,885 --> 01:11:03,079
I'm good.

1381
01:11:03,325 --> 01:11:06,442
I finished a long article.
Worked on it for 5 months...

1382
01:11:06,725 --> 01:11:09,444
and then we've been
vacationing a little bit.

1383
01:11:09,685 --> 01:11:10,720
My goodness!

1384
01:11:10,925 --> 01:11:11,755
Where'd you go?

1385
01:11:11,965 --> 01:11:13,444
To California.

1386
01:11:13,645 --> 01:11:15,363
Have you read Sid's book?

1387
01:11:15,565 --> 01:11:16,918
- How you been?
- Good.

1388
01:11:17,165 --> 01:11:19,235
I liked it very much.
A bit long.

1389
01:11:19,485 --> 01:11:21,237
Not too long. I was engrossed.

1390
01:11:21,445 --> 01:11:24,562
- How's your acting career?
- Slow, but breathing.

1391
01:11:24,885 --> 01:11:27,399
- Still working at Chippers?
- You remembered.

1392
01:11:29,725 --> 01:11:33,115
What was the spy movie we saw
last week? "The Hawk and the...?"

1393
01:11:33,325 --> 01:11:34,599
"The Falcon and the Snowman."

1394
01:11:34,805 --> 01:11:35,920
Thank you.

1395
01:11:36,165 --> 01:11:38,201
Doesn't it remind
you of that a bit?

1396
01:11:38,445 --> 01:11:40,242
Maybe I don't
remember the movie.

1397
01:11:40,445 --> 01:11:43,039
Young spies in trouble...

1398
01:11:44,925 --> 01:11:46,563
What have you been doing?

1399
01:11:47,405 --> 01:11:48,520
Nothing interesting.

1400
01:11:48,725 --> 01:11:50,363
- I called you Friday.
- I'm sorry.

1401
01:11:50,645 --> 01:11:53,603
I got your message. We were
in California a couple more days...

1402
01:11:53,845 --> 01:11:56,313
because she's never been
to San Francisco.

1403
01:11:56,565 --> 01:11:58,999
- I love that town!
- It was wonderful.

1404
01:11:59,245 --> 01:12:01,201
Until I tried to drive.

1405
01:12:03,045 --> 01:12:05,513
Never been more
terrified in my life.

1406
01:12:05,725 --> 01:12:07,522
- You should've seen her!
- I tried!

1407
01:12:07,725 --> 01:12:10,717
We were airborne, literally.
Like a special-effects movie.

1408
01:12:10,925 --> 01:12:11,994
It was scary.

1409
01:12:12,845 --> 01:12:16,520
I was just clutching the
thing for my life.

1410
01:12:17,005 --> 01:12:18,484
- Where'd you stay?
- The Fairmont.

1411
01:12:18,885 --> 01:12:20,079
Big time!

1412
01:12:20,725 --> 01:12:22,716
How'd you meet David?

1413
01:12:22,965 --> 01:12:24,193
How did we meet?

1414
01:12:24,405 --> 01:12:27,317
Well, I took her away
from a Nobel scientist.

1415
01:12:27,525 --> 01:12:29,880
I wasn't even going
out with him.

1416
01:12:30,085 --> 01:12:31,234
I was his translator.

1417
01:12:31,445 --> 01:12:32,844
Yes, and companion.

1418
01:12:33,045 --> 01:12:36,560
And she translated so well that
he offered to dump his wife.

1419
01:12:36,805 --> 01:12:40,036
You make it sound more
interesting than it was.

1420
01:12:40,285 --> 01:12:42,082
- Really?
- Excuse me.

1421
01:13:08,765 --> 01:13:11,563
Got a minute, Lee? Say
hello to Shelly Rubin.

1422
01:13:12,725 --> 01:13:15,285
You gotta catch this kid.
Great young comic.

1423
01:13:15,965 --> 01:13:18,320
Someone has to
do a piece on him.

1424
01:13:18,525 --> 01:13:20,277
The next Robin Williams.

1425
01:13:20,925 --> 01:13:24,235
Do Jack Nicholson
at the Seder for him.

1426
01:13:24,445 --> 01:13:25,434
It's hysterical.

1427
01:13:25,645 --> 01:13:29,843
Just attended my first Seder.
What a shindig that was!

1428
01:13:30,165 --> 01:13:31,518
Haggadah this...

1429
01:13:31,725 --> 01:13:32,999
haggadah that.

1430
01:13:33,205 --> 01:13:36,117
Only thing you gotta do
is drink a lot of wine.

1431
01:13:36,525 --> 01:13:38,004
That's uncanny.

1432
01:13:38,525 --> 01:13:40,595
- Isn't it great?
- Glad I saw it live.

1433
01:13:40,845 --> 01:13:43,678
- You have a great future.
- But I got more.

1434
01:13:44,125 --> 01:13:45,604
Cabernet for the Manichewitz...

1435
01:13:45,845 --> 01:13:48,313
Thanks, Lee.
We'll hook up.

1436
01:13:48,525 --> 01:13:50,959
- We should talk and meet.
- Nice talking to you!

1437
01:13:51,165 --> 01:13:52,723
We'll be in touch,
okay? Thanks.

1438
01:13:53,565 --> 01:13:56,523
Just in time. I was dying
of comedy poisoning.

1439
01:13:56,725 --> 01:13:58,078
You never came by.

1440
01:13:59,405 --> 01:14:02,238
I don't know why. Got
sidetracked, I guess.

1441
01:14:02,485 --> 01:14:03,600
That's all right.

1442
01:14:03,885 --> 01:14:06,683
Though I was pretty sure
you'd come that night.

1443
01:14:07,005 --> 01:14:09,917
All that talk
about my great face...

1444
01:14:10,165 --> 01:14:11,996
Well, it still looks...

1445
01:14:12,325 --> 01:14:13,474
exquisite.

1446
01:14:13,805 --> 01:14:17,081
Under these lights, especially,
you look fantastic.

1447
01:14:17,565 --> 01:14:20,557
Is that your girlfriend, or
another transvestite?

1448
01:14:20,805 --> 01:14:21,999
No, she's just...

1449
01:14:22,285 --> 01:14:23,604
She's a friend.

1450
01:14:24,765 --> 01:14:26,244
She's beautiful.

1451
01:14:26,805 --> 01:14:28,204
I'll get you a...

1452
01:14:30,085 --> 01:14:32,679
So you're with
David, right?

1453
01:14:33,045 --> 01:14:34,319
Yes and no.

1454
01:14:35,365 --> 01:14:36,514
Meaning?

1455
01:14:36,765 --> 01:14:38,357
What are you doing later?

1456
01:14:41,925 --> 01:14:43,153
Later?

1457
01:14:43,525 --> 01:14:46,358
After you drop off your
date, are you busy?

1458
01:14:48,365 --> 01:14:50,083
When? When
later?

1459
01:14:50,285 --> 01:14:54,039
We're meeting some friends now,
but why don't you meet me?

1460
01:14:54,285 --> 01:14:57,721
Meet me at the kiosk
opposite El Teddy's at 12.

1461
01:14:57,965 --> 01:14:59,523
Twelve noon, Tomorrow?

1462
01:14:59,725 --> 01:15:02,398
Twelve tonight.
Unless you're busy.

1463
01:15:02,605 --> 01:15:04,004
Twelve tonight?

1464
01:15:04,245 --> 01:15:06,156
Can I make you a
more European offer?

1465
01:15:06,365 --> 01:15:08,401
A kiosk at midnight?

1466
01:15:09,885 --> 01:15:11,159
Sure, sure.

1467
01:15:11,805 --> 01:15:13,716
We should get going.

1468
01:15:14,605 --> 01:15:16,516
Congratulations on the novel.

1469
01:15:16,765 --> 01:15:18,198
It's been a ballbreaker.

1470
01:15:18,405 --> 01:15:19,520
Really?

1471
01:15:19,725 --> 01:15:21,681
- Bonnie said she loved it.
- She would.

1472
01:15:21,965 --> 01:15:23,523
And she's a ballbreaker.

1473
01:15:23,765 --> 01:15:27,314
I hope it's good. I put two
years of my life into it.

1474
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:32,676
I've never worked longer
than 5 months on anything, so...

1475
01:15:33,685 --> 01:15:35,676
Heard what Eric Jeffers said?

1476
01:15:35,885 --> 01:15:36,635
No.

1477
01:15:36,845 --> 01:15:39,882
She's working on a book about
experiences in the judicial system.

1478
01:15:40,085 --> 01:15:41,677
Ought to be a beaut.

1479
01:15:41,925 --> 01:15:44,314
Isn't Nola a little young
for David Delile?

1480
01:15:44,525 --> 01:15:45,355
Young?

1481
01:15:45,605 --> 01:15:47,084
He's your age, right?

1482
01:15:47,325 --> 01:15:48,883
I don't know.

1483
01:15:49,725 --> 01:15:51,124
How are you? Tired?

1484
01:15:51,325 --> 01:15:53,759
I got a little ulcer
problem here.

1485
01:15:54,245 --> 01:15:56,600
Poor baby. Got
a tummy ache?

1486
01:15:56,845 --> 01:15:57,914
Want your Pepcid?

1487
01:15:58,125 --> 01:16:01,242
- I checked. We're all out.
- We got some Mylanta.

1488
01:16:01,445 --> 01:16:03,640
Only Pepcid works for me.

1489
01:16:03,845 --> 01:16:05,483
I'll go to the 24-hour drugstore.

1490
01:16:05,725 --> 01:16:07,238
- This is bugging me.
- You going now?

1491
01:16:07,485 --> 01:16:09,441
- Yeah, it's a drag.
- I'm half-undressed.

1492
01:16:09,765 --> 01:16:11,198
You don't have to go!

1493
01:16:11,405 --> 01:16:13,236
You go to bed and...

1494
01:16:13,525 --> 01:16:15,083
Don't be silly.

1495
01:16:16,205 --> 01:16:19,436
I don't need an escort
to go to the...

1496
01:16:20,485 --> 01:16:21,679
drugstore.

1497
01:16:22,925 --> 01:16:24,483
I should get this fixed...

1498
01:16:24,685 --> 01:16:26,880
otherwise it'll bug me all night.

1499
01:16:27,165 --> 01:16:30,601
Be back soon, the moving men
are coming early tomorrow.

1500
01:16:30,925 --> 01:16:33,280
Yeah, I won't forget.
What's the time?

1501
01:16:33,525 --> 01:16:34,594
It's 11:45.

1502
01:16:34,805 --> 01:16:36,716
- See you soon.
- Give me a kiss.

1503
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:39,075
- Very soon, okay?
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

1504
01:16:39,285 --> 01:16:40,400
I'm beat.

1505
01:17:09,045 --> 01:17:10,478
Sorry I'm late.

1506
01:17:10,725 --> 01:17:12,317
Been waiting long?

1507
01:17:13,565 --> 01:17:14,918
You're not late.

1508
01:17:15,125 --> 01:17:17,036
Listen, I have to level with you.

1509
01:17:17,245 --> 01:17:19,964
I can't really go
anywhere right now.

1510
01:17:20,645 --> 01:17:22,476
I don't know where to begin.

1511
01:17:22,725 --> 01:17:24,317
My luck's been lousy.

1512
01:17:24,725 --> 01:17:27,558
I got myself into a situation,
for whatever reason.

1513
01:17:27,805 --> 01:17:29,602
I was married
for a long time.

1514
01:17:29,845 --> 01:17:33,554
I thought I'd be better
single and it's been great.

1515
01:17:34,125 --> 01:17:36,923
It's been wild,
but lonely too.

1516
01:17:37,165 --> 01:17:40,316
And I know I should've come
by for you when I met you...

1517
01:17:40,805 --> 01:17:42,124
and I didn't.

1518
01:17:42,445 --> 01:17:45,676
And I think I didn't because I
was wary of you...

1519
01:17:45,925 --> 01:17:49,679
because I knew you triggered
some real feelings inside me.

1520
01:17:50,925 --> 01:17:53,041
And yet again, I fucked up.

1521
01:17:53,285 --> 01:17:55,799
But I'm going to rectify
things before it's too late.

1522
01:17:56,005 --> 01:17:58,200
So please, what are
you doing tomorrow?

1523
01:18:01,085 --> 01:18:03,076
Is that you or your novel?

1524
01:18:03,285 --> 01:18:05,799
I'll be okay by
tomorrow, I promise.

1525
01:18:08,965 --> 01:18:11,240
I don't want to to cause
anyone any problems.

1526
01:18:11,525 --> 01:18:13,243
Sure. And David and you?

1527
01:18:13,605 --> 01:18:17,393
I've told David many times I
need someone to control me...

1528
01:18:18,165 --> 01:18:19,996
and I don't think he can do it.

1529
01:18:21,365 --> 01:18:23,640
And every guy
I meet...

1530
01:18:23,925 --> 01:18:27,713
thinks he'll be the one who'll
make me faithful. So be warned.

1531
01:18:28,605 --> 01:18:31,438
You should know
I don't scare easily.

1532
01:18:31,725 --> 01:18:34,034
I'm telling you because
you don't know me.

1533
01:18:34,245 --> 01:18:36,236
I know you, I've written
about you twice.

1534
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:40,074
Twice you were the obscure
object of desire in my books.

1535
01:18:40,725 --> 01:18:42,955
The books failed.
My fault, not yours.

1536
01:18:43,165 --> 01:18:46,043
But I know you
inside out. It's scary.

1537
01:18:46,245 --> 01:18:48,679
Don't be misled.
You didn't make me up.

1538
01:18:48,965 --> 01:18:51,399
I'm telling that whatever
restlessness you've felt...

1539
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:54,518
whatever moodiness
and unpredictability...

1540
01:18:54,765 --> 01:18:56,960
you've broken
hearts with...

1541
01:18:57,725 --> 01:18:59,955
and baby, you're
a heartbreaker...

1542
01:19:01,405 --> 01:19:03,475
it's all over
tonight.

1543
01:19:05,485 --> 01:19:08,955
Where'd you get that confidence?
Or are you scared?

1544
01:19:09,605 --> 01:19:10,799
I'm not David.

1545
01:19:11,165 --> 01:19:13,918
I created you twice out
of my imagination.

1546
01:19:14,165 --> 01:19:17,157
I wrote about you before
I even knew you existed.

1547
01:19:17,365 --> 01:19:20,084
Except one day,
I knew I'd meet you.

1548
01:19:21,645 --> 01:19:22,998
Well, what am I thinking?

1549
01:19:23,205 --> 01:19:25,799
You're thinking, "I wish
he'd shut up and kiss me."

1550
01:19:27,605 --> 01:19:29,994
- But you're late.
- I'm not late.

1551
01:19:30,365 --> 01:19:32,276
I think I'm right
on time for you.

1552
01:19:32,765 --> 01:19:36,314
But why would I kiss you here with
your apartment two blocks away?

1553
01:19:36,565 --> 01:19:38,954
- How did you know?
- Why wouldn't I know?

1554
01:19:39,165 --> 01:19:41,520
You were "Steffi"
in my first book...

1555
01:19:41,725 --> 01:19:43,602
and "Louise" in my second...

1556
01:19:47,645 --> 01:19:49,044
and now you're Nola.

1557
01:20:16,565 --> 01:20:17,998
- Hello?
- Movers.

1558
01:20:18,205 --> 01:20:21,436
Come right up, please.
I'll leave the door open.

1559
01:20:35,245 --> 01:20:36,314
Wake up!

1560
01:20:39,045 --> 01:20:41,195
The movers are here
with my things.

1561
01:20:41,445 --> 01:20:43,242
Sorry about last night.

1562
01:20:43,605 --> 01:20:46,881
The second you left for
the drugstore I conked out.

1563
01:20:47,165 --> 01:20:49,633
You must've been so disappointed
when you got back.

1564
01:20:49,965 --> 01:20:52,684
- The moving men are here?
- Yup. It's 7:30.

1565
01:20:52,965 --> 01:20:55,320
- Listen, Bonnie.
- I made some coffee.

1566
01:20:55,605 --> 01:20:57,960
- Bonnie, listen.
- What is it?

1567
01:20:58,205 --> 01:20:59,320
I have to...

1568
01:20:59,965 --> 01:21:01,364
talk to you.

1569
01:21:01,605 --> 01:21:03,243
All right, I'm listening.

1570
01:21:03,485 --> 01:21:05,601
You got to listen.

1571
01:21:05,845 --> 01:21:09,474
- I've done a terrible thing.
- I bet it's a really bad thing.

1572
01:21:09,725 --> 01:21:12,193
- No, you should listen.
- All right.

1573
01:21:13,245 --> 01:21:15,600
I don't know how to say it, but...

1574
01:21:17,125 --> 01:21:20,754
- I wanna call this off.
- What are you talking about?

1575
01:21:21,485 --> 01:21:23,237
I know you'll think I'm the most...

1576
01:21:23,485 --> 01:21:26,079
fucked-up son of a bitch in
the world, and I am.

1577
01:21:26,325 --> 01:21:29,397
I'll try and be honest in
my own stupid way.

1578
01:21:30,045 --> 01:21:31,842
I met someone else, Bonnie.

1579
01:21:33,725 --> 01:21:35,078
You what?

1580
01:21:35,725 --> 01:21:37,920
Listen, I met someone else.

1581
01:21:39,045 --> 01:21:42,321
I met someone else. I don't
know how else to say it.

1582
01:21:42,765 --> 01:21:45,723
- How could you?
- You have every right to hate me.

1583
01:21:46,765 --> 01:21:50,280
- I just moved in yesterday.
- I'm just so screwed up.

1584
01:21:50,565 --> 01:21:52,317
I wish I could put
it another way, but...

1585
01:21:52,525 --> 01:21:54,277
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

1586
01:21:54,525 --> 01:21:57,676
- Moving in together...
- Yeah, it was your idea!

1587
01:21:57,925 --> 01:21:59,597
I know, and if I could explain it...

1588
01:21:59,885 --> 01:22:02,160
So when did you meet
this "someone else"?

1589
01:22:02,525 --> 01:22:04,800
- That's not important...
- No, it is!

1590
01:22:05,005 --> 01:22:06,563
I have rearranged my goddam life!

1591
01:22:06,765 --> 01:22:09,233
I know you did. And
this is so difficult to...

1592
01:22:09,485 --> 01:22:12,397
- You said you loved me!
- I said I thought I did.

1593
01:22:12,765 --> 01:22:14,756
And believe me, I wanted to.

1594
01:22:15,005 --> 01:22:17,314
- You're a wonderful person.
- Know what?

1595
01:22:17,605 --> 01:22:19,755
- You're a sick son of a bitch.
- You're right.

1596
01:22:19,965 --> 01:22:22,957
- That goes downstairs.
- Get the fuck out, please? Thanks.

1597
01:22:23,245 --> 01:22:25,759
Listen, I accept
full responsibility.

1598
01:22:26,005 --> 01:22:27,597
I'm a total asshole.

1599
01:22:27,885 --> 01:22:30,001
Yeah, you're a total asshole!

1600
01:22:30,205 --> 01:22:33,117
But I thought if I was honest
and brought it up openly...

1601
01:22:33,365 --> 01:22:35,720
that we could understand
that at least...

1602
01:22:36,005 --> 01:22:38,519
I truly do not mean
you any harm.

1603
01:22:38,765 --> 01:22:42,440
I know how you
feel and I feel so bad.

1604
01:22:43,045 --> 01:22:45,513
But if we just
accept me as sick...

1605
01:22:45,725 --> 01:22:48,637
and try to, I know it's
hard, remain rational...

1606
01:22:48,885 --> 01:22:51,843
then we can do this with
the minimum of disruption.

1607
01:22:52,125 --> 01:22:55,879
Naturally, you can store your
stuff here for a while and...

1608
01:22:56,285 --> 01:22:57,718
You're fucking psychotic!

1609
01:22:57,925 --> 01:23:01,042
Bonnie, this is hard and I
just don't know. I'm so...

1610
01:23:01,285 --> 01:23:02,400
Ah, boy!

1611
01:23:05,245 --> 01:23:07,156
What are you doing with my novel?

1612
01:23:09,405 --> 01:23:11,521
Now, that's an only copy!

1613
01:23:18,165 --> 01:23:19,200
Hey, buddy!

1614
01:23:19,485 --> 01:23:22,716
Did you see a woman come
out of here with a manuscript?

1615
01:23:23,405 --> 01:23:25,794
I saw a girl come out the door.

1616
01:23:26,005 --> 01:23:27,358
Where'd she go?

1617
01:23:27,605 --> 01:23:29,596
Tall girl?
Ran across the street.

1618
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:22,800
In 5...

1619
01:24:22,885 --> 01:24:23,715
4...

1620
01:24:23,925 --> 01:24:24,801
3...

1621
01:24:26,725 --> 01:24:29,444
Now "Manhattan Moods"
goes live to our feature...

1622
01:24:29,645 --> 01:24:31,283
"Luncheon at Le Bijou."

1623
01:24:32,885 --> 01:24:36,764
Hi, I'm Robin Simon.
Welcome to Le Bijou...

1624
01:24:37,005 --> 01:24:39,200
New York's most
exciting restaurant...

1625
01:24:39,405 --> 01:24:41,873
where every day is a
potpourri of the city's...

1626
01:24:42,085 --> 01:24:45,555
most rich and
famous residents.

1627
01:24:45,805 --> 01:24:48,638
I'm sitting here
talking to Evelyn Isaacs...

1628
01:24:48,845 --> 01:24:51,439
Manhattan's most exclusive
real estate broker.

1629
01:24:51,645 --> 01:24:53,158
The woman who has situated...

1630
01:24:53,365 --> 01:24:55,481
- Is that correct?
- I like it.

1631
01:24:55,685 --> 01:24:58,916
The cream of the city's
most luminous residents.

1632
01:24:59,125 --> 01:25:02,356
You were saying you couldn't
get rock star Ennis Taylor...

1633
01:25:02,565 --> 01:25:04,237
into the apartment
he wanted.

1634
01:25:04,445 --> 01:25:07,960
The tenants didn't want the press
and groupies hanging around.

1635
01:25:08,325 --> 01:25:10,475
Must've been leery of wild parties.

1636
01:25:10,725 --> 01:25:13,956
Yes, but Ennis is not what
you'd think from his band.

1637
01:25:14,205 --> 01:25:18,039
He's not violent or destructive,
he's intellectual and sweet.

1638
01:25:18,365 --> 01:25:21,641
But the board of the co-op
had a problem with his snakes.

1639
01:25:21,885 --> 01:25:25,241
They had a problem with
the boa constrictor.

1640
01:25:25,565 --> 01:25:27,203
Any other big name turndowns?

1641
01:25:27,405 --> 01:25:30,317
No, but I got a beautiful triplex
for the Charles Aranows,

1642
01:25:30,525 --> 01:25:34,040
12 rooms on Park Avenue, and they
made one into a Hamptons room.

1643
01:25:34,285 --> 01:25:37,994
Tons of sand from Amagansett
to cover the floor. It's fun!

1644
01:25:38,445 --> 01:25:40,163
Well, thank you. I see.

1645
01:25:40,885 --> 01:25:42,318
It's time to table-hop...

1646
01:25:42,565 --> 01:25:45,079
so we can meet some of
the other exciting patrons...

1647
01:25:45,285 --> 01:25:47,719
who lunch typically at
Le Bijou.

1648
01:25:48,125 --> 01:25:50,844
Look who's here. Senator Bob
Paley! How are you?

1649
01:25:51,085 --> 01:25:53,201
We're here for the celebrity
golf tournament.

1650
01:25:53,405 --> 01:25:55,441
I play every year and
it's a good cause...

1651
01:25:55,645 --> 01:25:57,522
earning money for
the Heart Foundation.

1652
01:25:57,725 --> 01:25:59,716
They say I'll be paired
with Greg Norman.

1653
01:25:59,925 --> 01:26:01,199
Wonderful!

1654
01:26:01,445 --> 01:26:04,278
Any comments about
the recent allegations?

1655
01:26:04,485 --> 01:26:08,160
I think when the facts are in, the
Justice Department will find...

1656
01:26:08,365 --> 01:26:11,994
I made an error of judgement,
without real intent of treason.

1657
01:26:12,205 --> 01:26:13,433
Moving right along...

1658
01:26:13,685 --> 01:26:17,121
I see Dee Bartholemew,
"Empress of Gossip".

1659
01:26:17,405 --> 01:26:21,876
Robin, hi. So rainy out today.
Just this gloomy weather.

1660
01:26:22,245 --> 01:26:25,601
But I love your pin.
Is that Georgian?

1661
01:26:25,845 --> 01:26:28,040
Thank you. No,
it's Art Nouveau.

1662
01:26:28,245 --> 01:26:29,724
Where'd you get it?

1663
01:26:29,925 --> 01:26:32,758
My first husband gave me it for
our 15th wedding anniversary.

1664
01:26:33,005 --> 01:26:36,793
When you say "first", do
I sense a second on the way?

1665
01:26:37,365 --> 01:26:40,721
I ran into Tony Gardella
at the Café Carlyle.

1666
01:26:41,005 --> 01:26:44,839
He had a blissed-out look,
like he was in heaven.

1667
01:26:45,285 --> 01:26:48,516
How'd you manage to put
that smile on his face?

1668
01:26:50,045 --> 01:26:51,444
Using my head.

1669
01:26:52,245 --> 01:26:55,078
Any choice items
for our viewers?

1670
01:26:55,445 --> 01:26:58,278
Very prominent
actress/singer...

1671
01:26:58,525 --> 01:27:01,437
has become pregnant on
visiting Buckingham Palace.

1672
01:27:01,685 --> 01:27:03,243
No names, please.

1673
01:27:03,445 --> 01:27:04,878
Well, thank you.

1674
01:27:07,045 --> 01:27:09,195
Look who's here!
Donald Trump.

1675
01:27:09,445 --> 01:27:10,958
What are you working on?

1676
01:27:11,165 --> 01:27:13,360
I'm working on buying
St Patrick's Cathedral...

1677
01:27:13,605 --> 01:27:15,084
doing a little rip-down job...

1678
01:27:15,285 --> 01:27:17,879
and putting up a tall,
beautiful building.

1679
01:27:18,085 --> 01:27:19,518
That's wonderful!

1680
01:27:19,965 --> 01:27:21,444
- You were great!
- Terrible!

1681
01:27:21,645 --> 01:27:24,717
You said you couldn't do it.
And I said, "Yes, you can."

1682
01:27:25,005 --> 01:27:27,041
No actress-turned-
interviewer...

1683
01:27:27,285 --> 01:27:29,401
- could do it as real as you did.
- I was a jerk.

1684
01:27:29,605 --> 01:27:31,721
You're not a jerk.
You were real!

1685
01:27:31,925 --> 01:27:35,235
No-one cares if it's unpolished.
They find it appealing.

1686
01:27:35,445 --> 01:27:37,322
It's your 15 minutes of fame.

1687
01:27:37,565 --> 01:27:39,283
I never believed what
Andy Warhol said...

1688
01:27:39,525 --> 01:27:43,234
that we're all famous for 15
minutes. Nice, but it's not true.

1689
01:27:43,525 --> 01:27:46,881
Almost nobody will ever be
famous for even one minute.

1690
01:27:47,205 --> 01:27:48,684
So enjoy it!

1691
01:27:48,925 --> 01:27:50,756
How did I swing this?

1692
01:27:51,005 --> 01:27:55,157
Last year I was teaching English,
performing a serious function.

1693
01:27:55,405 --> 01:27:58,317
And suddenly, through a
whirlwind series of events...

1694
01:27:58,565 --> 01:28:01,796
I become the sort of woman I've
always hated. But I'm happier.

1695
01:28:02,965 --> 01:28:04,921
You nervous
about Saturday?

1696
01:28:05,165 --> 01:28:06,041
Are you?

1697
01:28:06,245 --> 01:28:07,678
I'm counting the seconds.

1698
01:28:11,485 --> 01:28:13,282
My hands are sweating.
I never sweat.

1699
01:28:13,485 --> 01:28:15,635
- Got the ring?
- What am I, a schmuck? Sure!

1700
01:28:15,845 --> 01:28:18,996
Sophisticated. Very
educated. She sure is!

1701
01:28:19,205 --> 01:28:20,115
Oh, picture!

1702
01:28:21,205 --> 01:28:24,402
I like this girl.
I think she's terrific.

1703
01:28:24,845 --> 01:28:27,882
It's ironic.
You go to get face work...

1704
01:28:28,125 --> 01:28:30,355
and you meet a wonderful
guy who changes your life.

1705
01:28:30,565 --> 01:28:32,237
Better than face work.

1706
01:28:32,565 --> 01:28:35,796
- Think this looks okay?
- You look perfect.

1707
01:28:36,125 --> 01:28:37,524
I expected a bigger turnout.

1708
01:28:37,725 --> 01:28:39,602
Ma, they wanted to keep it small.

1709
01:28:40,645 --> 01:28:41,873
Isn't that...?

1710
01:28:42,445 --> 01:28:43,924
Al Swayze, a
friend of Tony's.

1711
01:28:44,125 --> 01:28:46,002
- Yeah, he...
- Does the weather.

1712
01:28:46,405 --> 01:28:48,965
Right, he does the weather
on channel...

1713
01:28:49,245 --> 01:28:50,883
Hello, how'd you do?

1714
01:28:51,125 --> 01:28:52,524
Congratulations.

1715
01:28:52,805 --> 01:28:54,284
Thank you. My daughter, Iris.

1716
01:28:54,565 --> 01:28:57,523
So glad to meet you.
We enjoy your program.

1717
01:28:57,765 --> 01:28:59,118
Really? Nice to meet you too.

1718
01:28:59,405 --> 01:29:01,236
We watch you
give the weather.

1719
01:29:01,485 --> 01:29:03,282
You're usually wrong.

1720
01:29:04,325 --> 01:29:05,917
Occupational hazard, y'know?

1721
01:29:06,125 --> 01:29:09,435
But you're cheerful.
You're all so cheerful.

1722
01:29:49,325 --> 01:29:51,555
I can't find her.
Did you see her?

1723
01:29:51,845 --> 01:29:52,834
Did I...?

1724
01:29:53,565 --> 01:29:55,681
- What happened?
- She's not in the bathroom.

1725
01:29:56,605 --> 01:29:59,563
- You were with her.
- I don't know what happened to her.

1726
01:29:59,845 --> 01:30:01,403
Frankie, come on.

1727
01:30:01,845 --> 01:30:02,641
Relax.

1728
01:30:02,845 --> 01:30:05,359
How can I relax?
She's gotta be here.

1729
01:30:07,005 --> 01:30:09,758
- What's going on?
- It's all right, Ma. Nothing.

1730
01:30:10,005 --> 01:30:11,802
I'm sure it'll all turn out okay.

1731
01:30:12,045 --> 01:30:14,275
She walked out,
alone. 15, 20 minutes ago.

1732
01:30:14,485 --> 01:30:15,918
- Where'd she go?
- I didn't see.

1733
01:30:16,125 --> 01:30:18,195
- You sure she was alone?
- Absolutely.

1734
01:30:18,405 --> 01:30:21,238
Frankie, go up and stall them.
I'm gonna look around.

1735
01:30:21,445 --> 01:30:23,481
- Where?
- I don't know!

1736
01:30:23,725 --> 01:30:26,956
You're out of your mind.
What'll I tell your parents?

1737
01:30:32,405 --> 01:30:35,875
- Everything's fine.
- I hope she's all right.

1738
01:30:36,165 --> 01:30:37,962
- What's going on?
- She's nervous, Ma.

1739
01:30:38,165 --> 01:30:40,998
She needs time
to fix her makeup.

1740
01:30:41,245 --> 01:30:42,439
Should I go help her?

1741
01:30:42,645 --> 01:30:44,442
- Tony's all right?
- Please don't go help her.

1742
01:30:44,725 --> 01:30:47,444
She'll come out.
Iris, just leave her alone.

1743
01:30:47,685 --> 01:30:49,482
She's gathering herself.

1744
01:30:56,085 --> 01:30:58,201
Olga PS YCHIC READER
AND ADVISER

1745
01:31:01,725 --> 01:31:03,443
Want a reading?

1746
01:31:03,645 --> 01:31:04,839
Come on inside.

1747
01:31:05,045 --> 01:31:07,081
- I'll give you a nice reading.
- No, I'm just walking.

1748
01:31:07,285 --> 01:31:08,877
You look like you need a reading.

1749
01:31:09,125 --> 01:31:11,241
- Really?
- Come inside.

1750
01:31:11,445 --> 01:31:13,834
- Come on in.
- I don't believe in psychics.

1751
01:31:14,325 --> 01:31:16,964
You don't have to
for a reading.

1752
01:31:17,805 --> 01:31:19,238
So what do you do?

1753
01:31:19,485 --> 01:31:21,077
I work in television.

1754
01:31:21,765 --> 01:31:23,483
But you used to do something else?

1755
01:31:23,805 --> 01:31:25,716
Yes, I was a teacher.

1756
01:31:26,965 --> 01:31:28,239
I see...

1757
01:31:29,045 --> 01:31:30,398
the name Beowulf.

1758
01:31:30,605 --> 01:31:31,560
Oh my God!

1759
01:31:31,765 --> 01:31:33,756
Chaucer! I
taught Chaucer.

1760
01:31:34,285 --> 01:31:37,834
- Like some tea? Mint tea?
- I would love a drink.

1761
01:31:38,565 --> 01:31:41,033
I got a drink for you.
No problem.

1762
01:31:41,285 --> 01:31:43,560
So you like television better?

1763
01:31:43,925 --> 01:31:47,713
It's interesting to see who we
choose as our celebrities, and why.

1764
01:31:48,525 --> 01:31:50,083
What makes them tick.

1765
01:31:50,285 --> 01:31:52,958
You learn a lot about a society
by who it celebrates.

1766
01:31:53,245 --> 01:31:54,678
- Is this good?
- Yes, please.

1767
01:31:54,925 --> 01:31:57,644
Like, we did this show
on Sunny Von Bulow...

1768
01:31:57,885 --> 01:31:59,557
and she's a coma patient.

1769
01:31:59,805 --> 01:32:02,080
She lies there in a coma...

1770
01:32:02,325 --> 01:32:03,644
but she's a celebrity.

1771
01:32:04,525 --> 01:32:06,595
You were up there with
her. What happened?

1772
01:32:06,805 --> 01:32:08,443
She was okay. A little nervous.

1773
01:32:08,645 --> 01:32:10,636
Listen, I've got
bad news.

1774
01:32:10,845 --> 01:32:11,800
Here he is.

1775
01:32:12,085 --> 01:32:15,521
The wedding's off, so
why don't you all go home?

1776
01:32:15,965 --> 01:32:16,920
Thank you.

1777
01:32:18,725 --> 01:32:20,522
It's not gonna happen, Iris.

1778
01:32:20,925 --> 01:32:23,598
Just go home. Make sure
Mom gets there.

1779
01:32:24,325 --> 01:32:26,600
Are you all right?
Is she hurt?

1780
01:32:26,805 --> 01:32:28,761
No, nothing like that. Just go on.

1781
01:32:29,005 --> 01:32:30,358
- Thanks.
- I'll be home.

1782
01:32:30,565 --> 01:32:32,601
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1783
01:32:39,925 --> 01:32:41,563
It's all right. Just...

1784
01:32:42,605 --> 01:32:44,914
I'm here to help you.
Whatever.

1785
01:32:54,605 --> 01:32:56,402
You need a change
in your life.

1786
01:32:56,605 --> 01:32:59,438
You must reevaluate the
plans you were contemplating.

1787
01:32:59,645 --> 01:33:03,194
- I see you change your direction.
- I had planned to get married.

1788
01:33:03,525 --> 01:33:05,516
Perhaps it needs more scrutiny
before you decide.

1789
01:33:05,805 --> 01:33:06,920
Really?

1790
01:33:07,165 --> 01:33:09,235
- When was the wedding?
- Today.

1791
01:33:10,605 --> 01:33:13,165
I left him at the church with
his family and friends.

1792
01:33:13,365 --> 01:33:15,481
My God! What have
I done? I don't know!

1793
01:33:15,685 --> 01:33:18,757
If you're not sure you love him,
it's a mistake to go forward.

1794
01:33:19,005 --> 01:33:21,599
- I am sure. He's wonderful.
- So then I don't understand.

1795
01:33:21,845 --> 01:33:24,757
I feel guilty because I've
had such good luck.

1796
01:33:25,005 --> 01:33:26,836
Everyone I know has
so many problems.

1797
01:33:27,125 --> 01:33:30,913
They're lonely, needy. I
have this guy fall in my lap.

1798
01:33:31,605 --> 01:33:32,754
I still don't get it.

1799
01:33:32,965 --> 01:33:35,525
His name's Tony, and
I said, "You're terrific!"

1800
01:33:35,725 --> 01:33:37,443
"When will the other shoe drop?"

1801
01:33:37,885 --> 01:33:41,560
Some bad part of him that'll ruin things.
But there is no bad part.

1802
01:33:41,965 --> 01:33:43,603
- Well, you provided that.
- Me?

1803
01:33:43,805 --> 01:33:46,683
He's a wonderful guy, but
you screwed things up.

1804
01:33:46,885 --> 01:33:47,840
Why?

1805
01:33:48,125 --> 01:33:51,003
You said it yourself.
It's guilt.

1806
01:33:51,245 --> 01:33:53,600
You don't need a fortune
teller. You need a shrink.

1807
01:33:53,805 --> 01:33:56,273
- Me?
- You meet this wonderful guy, okay?

1808
01:33:56,525 --> 01:33:59,562
You can't believe something so wonderful
can happen to you.

1809
01:33:59,845 --> 01:34:01,722
So you ruin it.

1810
01:34:01,965 --> 01:34:05,037
I did a horrible thing.
He'll never forgive me.

1811
01:34:05,365 --> 01:34:06,718
Who could blame him?

1812
01:34:06,965 --> 01:34:09,354
You want your $10 of
psychic prediction?

1813
01:34:09,565 --> 01:34:12,523
He's going to forgive you.
Obviously, he's crazy about you.

1814
01:34:12,765 --> 01:34:16,724
Just because you've acted like a
horse's ass doesn't mean he will.

1815
01:34:16,965 --> 01:34:19,684
So you tell him
everything you told me...

1816
01:34:19,965 --> 01:34:21,398
and then...

1817
01:34:21,645 --> 01:34:23,044
you give him a big kiss.

1818
01:34:34,285 --> 01:34:35,604
We can be seen...

1819
01:34:36,565 --> 01:34:37,998
or don't you care?

1820
01:34:39,405 --> 01:34:40,520
I don't.

1821
01:34:41,085 --> 01:34:42,837
I care about you.

1822
01:34:46,325 --> 01:34:47,155
Perfect.

1823
01:34:48,325 --> 01:34:51,635
Emotionally it's exactly
where you should be.

1824
01:34:52,685 --> 01:34:54,676
I don't feel I'm there at all.

1825
01:34:55,005 --> 01:34:57,314
Trust it. We'll come
back to it tomorrow.

1826
01:34:57,525 --> 01:35:00,244
We'll stop now and
continue from here tomorrow.

1827
01:35:00,485 --> 01:35:04,239
I feel I know where she's coming
from, but she's contradictory.

1828
01:35:06,045 --> 01:35:09,674
Contradiction is good. Just don't
contradict yourself when you act.

1829
01:35:10,045 --> 01:35:12,684
Play one thing
at a time and trust it.

1830
01:35:13,245 --> 01:35:16,954
You have a hold on it.
Just don't look in the mirror.

1831
01:35:18,045 --> 01:35:19,364
Both of you.

1832
01:35:19,565 --> 01:35:21,521
Don't overplay the lust.

1833
01:35:21,765 --> 01:35:24,359
I know. She's a carnivore.

1834
01:35:26,525 --> 01:35:29,437
- Wanna have a drink?
- Yeah, love to.

1835
01:35:29,965 --> 01:35:31,284
We'll talk.

1836
01:35:33,085 --> 01:35:34,643
I just caught the ending.

1837
01:35:34,845 --> 01:35:37,598
Seems like a terrific scene.
It's great work.

1838
01:35:37,925 --> 01:35:40,962
- You didn't say you were coming.
- I was in the neighbourhood.

1839
01:35:41,165 --> 01:35:43,076
Thought I'd stop by to pick you up.

1840
01:35:43,325 --> 01:35:44,804
You know Greg.

1841
01:35:45,045 --> 01:35:47,115
- How you doing?
- Good to see you again.

1842
01:35:47,325 --> 01:35:50,874
- Going to Moran's round the corner.
- Do you wanna have that drink?

1843
01:35:51,125 --> 01:35:54,720
- I thought we'd walk home together.
- I want to talk to Greg.

1844
01:35:55,205 --> 01:35:58,675
- Thought you might want to walk.
- You know I'm in rehearsal!

1845
01:35:58,925 --> 01:36:02,201
I knew you'd be through by 5,
so what's the big deal?

1846
01:36:02,765 --> 01:36:06,201
I'm going to the bar, but
we can talk tomorrow.

1847
01:36:08,165 --> 01:36:10,884
- Don't crowd me! It's annoying.
- I'm not!

1848
01:36:11,085 --> 01:36:13,645
I came to pick you up.
Thought you'd be glad to see me.

1849
01:36:13,925 --> 01:36:15,643
- Things come up!
- Something's very wrong.

1850
01:36:15,845 --> 01:36:17,676
I stop by and it puts
you in a bad mood.

1851
01:36:17,885 --> 01:36:20,558
- It's because you don't trust me.
- Should I?

1852
01:36:20,765 --> 01:36:24,394
- Suspicious, that's your problem.
- You wanna sleep with the director.

1853
01:36:25,045 --> 01:36:28,754
- I'm not in the mood to argue.
- You said you loved me!

1854
01:36:29,205 --> 01:36:31,036
Why do you want me if
you don't trust me?

1855
01:36:31,245 --> 01:36:33,964
How can I? I turn my back
and you're off with someone.

1856
01:36:34,245 --> 01:36:36,839
I already told you, I
don't want to be closed in.

1857
01:36:37,085 --> 01:36:40,122
- So why are you living with me?
- I'm not! I've got an apartment.

1858
01:36:40,365 --> 01:36:42,754
- I just stay over most nights.
- I don't want to crowd you.

1859
01:36:42,965 --> 01:36:46,719
Let me get a drink and
go talk about the play.

1860
01:36:46,925 --> 01:36:50,281
"Fuck off so I can fuck the
director." I understand.

1861
01:36:50,525 --> 01:36:53,164
I am who I am. I told
you that when we met.

1862
01:36:53,405 --> 01:36:55,396
I always hope it'll be
different, but it never is.

1863
01:36:55,685 --> 01:36:58,677
You love me and you'll be hurt
if I give up on you.

1864
01:36:58,885 --> 01:37:00,637
So think about this.

1865
01:37:01,085 --> 01:37:02,598
Just go home.

1866
01:37:02,965 --> 01:37:05,798
We'll just enjoy the
time we have together...

1867
01:37:06,125 --> 01:37:07,638
and not complicate everything.

1868
01:37:07,845 --> 01:37:09,676
Everything doesn't
have to be questioned.

1869
01:37:09,965 --> 01:37:13,480
You're still saying, "Get lost
so I can sleep with the director."

1870
01:37:13,765 --> 01:37:16,757
Anyone would think I was
the whore of TriBeCa.

1871
01:37:17,285 --> 01:37:20,675
So would you be happy if I said
goodbye and never saw you again?

1872
01:37:21,405 --> 01:37:22,997
That wouldn't make me happy.

1873
01:37:23,205 --> 01:37:26,515
We haven't made love
in weeks. What is that?

1874
01:37:26,725 --> 01:37:29,762
Why do you want me, when I
just lie there like a dead fish?

1875
01:37:30,005 --> 01:37:32,803
But you didn't used to.
What happened?

1876
01:37:33,045 --> 01:37:33,921
Nothing.

1877
01:37:34,165 --> 01:37:35,234
It's me, okay.

1878
01:37:35,645 --> 01:37:39,399
It's me. Let's just stay in tonight
and not over-analyse everything?

1879
01:37:42,965 --> 01:37:44,956
What is it with the pills?

1880
01:37:45,205 --> 01:37:47,844
- Diet pills.
- Oh, please!

1881
01:37:55,125 --> 01:37:56,399
I give up.

1882
01:37:58,845 --> 01:38:01,723
So what do you want for dinner?
What should I buy?

1883
01:38:03,045 --> 01:38:04,239
Spaghetti.

1884
01:38:07,165 --> 01:38:09,315
I was going to ask
you to marry me.

1885
01:38:10,325 --> 01:38:11,519
No, penne...

1886
01:38:11,765 --> 01:38:13,403
with marinara.

1887
01:38:24,405 --> 01:38:25,633
Lee, right?

1888
01:38:25,845 --> 01:38:28,996
Phil Datloff. Bonnie brought
you to a party at my apartment.

1889
01:38:29,325 --> 01:38:33,034
Sure I remember you. You were very
kind. I passed out on your carpet.

1890
01:38:33,525 --> 01:38:35,163
- That I remember.
- That's right.

1891
01:38:35,365 --> 01:38:37,754
What happened to the book
you were toying with?

1892
01:38:37,965 --> 01:38:39,114
It just kind of...

1893
01:38:39,325 --> 01:38:40,440
floated away.

1894
01:38:40,805 --> 01:38:42,955
I thought about it the other day.

1895
01:38:43,285 --> 01:38:45,480
A culture that took a wrong
turn somewhere.

1896
01:38:45,685 --> 01:38:47,915
A flawed individual who
can't find himself.

1897
01:38:48,165 --> 01:38:49,314
That was my book.

1898
01:38:49,525 --> 01:38:52,483
Because V.J. Rajnipal,
a great writer...

1899
01:38:52,685 --> 01:38:55,916
just gave us a manuscript
on the same subject.

1900
01:38:56,165 --> 01:38:57,484
Really, the same subject?

1901
01:38:57,725 --> 01:39:00,114
A society where every single
member is famous.

1902
01:39:00,325 --> 01:39:02,441
There are no uncelebrated people.

1903
01:39:02,725 --> 01:39:03,874
Very satirical.

1904
01:39:04,885 --> 01:39:08,002
I'd like to have seen your
take on the same subject.

1905
01:39:08,205 --> 01:39:09,558
He's a great artist.

1906
01:39:09,765 --> 01:39:11,198
I could never...

1907
01:39:13,205 --> 01:39:16,038
- How's Bonnie?
- Fine. Great girl.

1908
01:39:16,685 --> 01:39:18,676
I think she sold
a screenplay.

1909
01:39:21,405 --> 01:39:25,193
We're at the star-spangled
première of "The Liquidator".

1910
01:39:26,485 --> 01:39:29,761
Unfortunately for the beautiful
people, the weather hasn't held up.

1911
01:39:30,005 --> 01:39:33,122
But the show must go on.
Here's producer, Dalton Freed.

1912
01:39:33,365 --> 01:39:36,880
- Can you believe the weather?
- Unbelievable. How you doing?

1913
01:39:37,605 --> 01:39:39,118
Could be better.

1914
01:39:39,405 --> 01:39:41,760
Hasn't kept people away.
Is this your wife?

1915
01:39:42,045 --> 01:39:45,560
This is a young actress you'll
be hearing a lot about.

1916
01:39:45,845 --> 01:39:47,756
My wife, you know,
she's in rehab.

1917
01:39:48,005 --> 01:39:50,599
I've read the reviews.
Very interesting!

1918
01:39:50,805 --> 01:39:53,365
- I never read reviews.
- And your next project?

1919
01:39:53,565 --> 01:39:55,999
"Birth of a Nation", an
all-black version.

1920
01:39:56,205 --> 01:39:57,274
Can't wait.

1921
01:39:57,485 --> 01:40:01,319
Oh my gosh, Erno DeLucca,
who did Nicole Olivier's wigs!

1922
01:40:02,525 --> 01:40:04,561
I also did her werewolf makeup.

1923
01:40:04,805 --> 01:40:06,682
- Werewolf?
- Yes, twice.

1924
01:40:07,205 --> 01:40:09,275
- Good job. Nice to see you.
- Thank you.

1925
01:40:09,525 --> 01:40:13,279
There'll be lots of big celebrities
tonight. I'll keep my eyes peeled.

1926
01:40:14,005 --> 01:40:15,882
Here's the director. How are you?

1927
01:40:16,085 --> 01:40:17,359
What a night!

1928
01:40:17,605 --> 01:40:20,961
Incredible, like a typhoon. Are
you from the weather channel?

1929
01:40:21,885 --> 01:40:25,719
I hear in your film you actually
have a big rain sequence.

1930
01:40:25,925 --> 01:40:29,440
We have amazing effects,
almost like the real thing.

1931
01:40:29,685 --> 01:40:31,038
Actually, they're better.

1932
01:40:31,285 --> 01:40:33,003
Thank you. Enjoy your night.

1933
01:40:33,285 --> 01:40:35,719
We'll be rooting for it.
I'm really excited about it.

1934
01:40:36,165 --> 01:40:37,803
Nicole Oliver! Here she is!

1935
01:40:38,005 --> 01:40:40,519
One of the stars
with her husband.

1936
01:40:40,725 --> 01:40:42,875
You look beautiful. Show us
what you're wearing.

1937
01:40:43,245 --> 01:40:44,439
I'm soaked.

1938
01:40:44,645 --> 01:40:47,113
Unbelievable. You look great.

1939
01:40:48,005 --> 01:40:50,121
The lights, the ambience,
the greasepaint...

1940
01:40:50,405 --> 01:40:52,521
You can't swing a cat
without hitting a celebrity.

1941
01:40:52,805 --> 01:40:55,956
And the rain didn't
seem to deter many people.

1942
01:40:56,285 --> 01:40:58,435
I'm really excited.
The big première!

1943
01:40:58,645 --> 01:41:01,603
Oh my gosh! Robin Simon
from "Manhattan Moods"!

1944
01:41:01,925 --> 01:41:05,634
Congratulations on your show,
your pregnancy, marriage, everything.

1945
01:41:05,965 --> 01:41:07,284
Doesn't she look beautiful?

1946
01:41:07,525 --> 01:41:09,755
Who knew angels flew so low?
Unbelievable.

1947
01:41:10,045 --> 01:41:13,799
Your show's taken off, and I'm
jealous. What about the rain?

1948
01:41:14,365 --> 01:41:16,003
- It's really something.
- It is!

1949
01:41:16,245 --> 01:41:18,759
Listen, have a great time.
You look incredible!

1950
01:41:19,285 --> 01:41:21,321
We got more people coming.

1951
01:41:21,525 --> 01:41:22,594
I see Sandor!

1952
01:41:25,165 --> 01:41:26,837
We feel sorry for him.

1953
01:41:27,805 --> 01:41:28,954
My goodness!

1954
01:41:33,845 --> 01:41:36,040
- What are you doing...?
- Incredible!

1955
01:41:36,485 --> 01:41:39,795
I haven't seen you for...
At the movies again!

1956
01:41:40,725 --> 01:41:42,556
This is my husband, Tony.

1957
01:41:42,805 --> 01:41:46,354
Nice to meet you.
Congratulations on everything.

1958
01:41:46,925 --> 01:41:49,678
- You're transformed!
- Such a surprise.

1959
01:41:49,965 --> 01:41:53,753
- It's not your kind of movie.
- I interviewed Nicole Olivier.

1960
01:41:54,205 --> 01:41:56,036
I read the interview.
It was marvelous.

1961
01:41:56,685 --> 01:41:59,961
Marvelous? Didn't that used to
be your least-favourite word?

1962
01:42:00,165 --> 01:42:02,315
- Stop it!
- Those crossword puzzles.

1963
01:42:03,285 --> 01:42:05,162
- Want some popcorn?
- I'd love some.

1964
01:42:05,445 --> 01:42:07,197
- Want a bag?
- That'd be great.

1965
01:42:07,405 --> 01:42:08,724
I can't believe...

1966
01:42:10,245 --> 01:42:11,963
Have I become insufferable?

1967
01:42:12,205 --> 01:42:15,481
- No, happy, confident and radiant.
- I am happy.

1968
01:42:16,245 --> 01:42:18,634
- Hi, Jack. Good to see you.
- Great article.

1969
01:42:18,845 --> 01:42:21,279
Robin Simon, I'm so excited
to meet you in person.

1970
01:42:21,485 --> 01:42:22,554
Thank you, darling.

1971
01:42:22,805 --> 01:42:25,160
I love your show.
Such a great broadcaster.

1972
01:42:25,405 --> 01:42:26,360
Aren't you sweet!

1973
01:42:26,565 --> 01:42:28,840
- God bless you.
- God bless you.

1974
01:42:29,045 --> 01:42:30,763
You're so radiant.

1975
01:42:31,605 --> 01:42:34,358
- Thank you. It's luck, Lee.
- Really?

1976
01:42:34,605 --> 01:42:38,075
No matter what the shrinks
and self-help books tell you.

1977
01:42:38,445 --> 01:42:40,675
Love is a question of luck.

1978
01:42:46,845 --> 01:42:48,676
I'm glad you were lucky.

1979
01:42:48,965 --> 01:42:50,284
You with anyone?

1980
01:42:50,485 --> 01:42:52,123
Not at the moment.

1981
01:42:53,045 --> 01:42:55,001
- What are you working on?
- Just the same...

1982
01:42:55,285 --> 01:42:56,877
A novel? A screenplay?

1983
01:42:57,805 --> 01:43:01,639
I did a huge interview at the old
actor's home. Very touching.

1984
01:43:02,005 --> 01:43:04,997
My Uncle Willie's there.
He asked about the autograph.

1985
01:43:05,285 --> 01:43:08,595
We did a report from
Charlie Manson's jail cell.

1986
01:43:08,925 --> 01:43:12,395
- So interesting.
- My nephew wanted his autograph.

1987
01:43:12,885 --> 01:43:15,115
- Oh, dear.
- Next time we're in California.

1988
01:43:15,965 --> 01:43:17,523
Here. Here you go.

1989
01:43:17,725 --> 01:43:19,955
Thanks for...
I don't want to hold you up.

1990
01:43:20,165 --> 01:43:22,998
Just, you know, it's really...

1991
01:43:23,605 --> 01:43:26,119
- And very nice to...
- Great to see you, Lee.

1992
01:43:26,325 --> 01:43:29,874
Really great to see you.
Hope you catch a break.

1993
01:43:30,305 --> 01:43:36,890
