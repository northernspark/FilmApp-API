2
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,388
I think it's best to start with my father's New Year's eve party.

3
00:00:39,948 --> 00:00:43,227
His party to celebrate the start of the new century.

4
00:00:43,547 --> 00:00:46,546
We do it as a new thought.

5
00:00:47,665 --> 00:00:52,063
The father was born in Romania and as a child moved to Scotland.

6
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:55,262
We stayed in Scotland After the mother's death, -

7
00:00:55,342 --> 00:00:58,661
until father decided to move families and business -

8
00:00:58,821 --> 00:01:01,860
on the outskirts of London this terrible town.

9
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:05,938
The townspeople were skeptical and inquisitive.

10
00:01:07,218 --> 00:01:12,696
It is hard to describe how passionately I wanted to change away from home.

11
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:23,011
Mr. Reisner! You know that it will bring the quality.

12
00:01:23,371 --> 00:01:25,610
Unpack it immediately!

13
00:01:25,811 --> 00:01:29,210
It has a festive! Do not you think?

14
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:34,047
It is an electric signboard. It appears no matter how far away!

15
00:01:34,447 --> 00:01:37,166
Plot is not yours.

16
00:01:37,446 --> 00:01:42,444
And the control of each decided that century changes until next year.

17
00:01:42,764 --> 00:01:46,283
It is celebrated in years. All agree.

18
00:01:46,603 --> 00:01:47,962
Paul!

19
00:01:48,882 --> 00:01:51,801
Come quickly to see!

20
00:01:55,359 --> 00:02:00,877
I happen to disagree, and I'm going to keep the feasts.

21
00:02:03,076 --> 00:02:05,955
I guess it just landed?

22
00:02:06,235 --> 00:02:10,233
I am proud kyltistäni, and I do not intend to demolish it.

23
00:02:10,473 --> 00:02:14,352
The municipality's decision must be respected. And a sign on the neighbor's land.

24
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:20,350
Why does a nice New Year's Eve 1899 not the last day of the century?

25
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:26,627
The child turns one year only after living years. - It's silly.

26
00:02:27,107 --> 00:02:30,706
Other countries celebrate next year. - But not the father.

27
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:33,504
No, not the father.

28
00:02:33,584 --> 00:02:37,782
Why do you celebrate New Year in general?

29
00:02:39,262 --> 00:02:42,661
That is a different time your religion, is not it?

30
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:46,180
You may know I'm also a Scot.

31
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:50,497
and Scots they only celebrate the new year.

32
00:02:51,098 --> 00:02:56,416
We shall have another meeting tonight, I warn you.

33
00:02:57,535 --> 00:03:02,053
See you tonight; You all have your invitations do you?

34
00:03:08,491 --> 00:03:10,810
WELCOME TO THE NEW CENTURY.

35
00:03:31,922 --> 00:03:37,600
It is early to welcome the rest of the guests welcome.

36
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:43,237
But there is 15 minutes to go.

37
00:03:56,512 --> 00:03:57,871
Cup.

38
00:03:58,352 --> 00:04:01,551
Welcome, in 1900.

39
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:05,708
Bravo.

40
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:08,228
New year, new century.

41
00:04:08,468 --> 00:04:11,907
And a new beginning for our town.

42
00:04:12,226 --> 00:04:13,945
Do not just keep talking.

43
00:04:14,186 --> 00:04:19,824
at the same time we congratulate my son, Paul.

44
00:04:20,783 --> 00:04:24,981
He joins groundbreaking of the Institute.

45
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:28,260
He will become a world-famous.

46
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,658
His departure tomorrow is going to be spectacular.

47
00:04:35,298 --> 00:04:38,137
compared to this evening.

48
00:04:39,016 --> 00:04:42,615
The carriages will pull six horses.

49
00:04:43,174 --> 00:04:45,333
None of horses.

50
00:05:07,005 --> 00:05:10,644
Welcome, even if the new century would be.

51
00:05:13,203 --> 00:05:15,762
The taste is good, at least.

52
00:05:17,801 --> 00:05:21,560
Father has ordered a phone. - So, is shown.

53
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,718
The new year starts in style.

54
00:05:27,437 --> 00:05:33,435
You were gonna sneak unnoticed. - I'm not sneaking anywhere.

55
00:05:33,715 --> 00:05:37,713
You wanted your party, I want to to go like this. Goodbye, Dad.

56
00:05:37,953 --> 00:05:42,711
I designed another kind of goodbye. I ordered the horses.

57
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:48,109
That's ridiculous rakkine! - No, the space is in abundance.

58
00:05:51,188 --> 00:05:52,987
Prepare is.

59
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:58,225
I'll walk you travel. Remember that you can call at any time.

60
00:05:58,425 --> 00:05:59,864
Yes, father.

61
00:06:00,105 --> 00:06:01,544
Drive faster.

62
00:06:01,824 --> 00:06:05,223
I distribute my advice, because you do not need them.

63
00:06:05,503 --> 00:06:10,181
But be sure to keep with you defense instrument.

64
00:06:10,581 --> 00:06:16,139
I'm just going to London. - There are four murders in the night.

65
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:20,897
Keep a sharp stone in your pocket. It is a useful piece of advice.

66
00:06:21,177 --> 00:06:25,295
A stone at you to defend. - I promise to be careful.

67
00:06:25,695 --> 00:06:30,813
Too bad you do not come juhliini. We had a very nice.

68
00:06:31,493 --> 00:06:32,932
A waste of time.

69
00:06:33,172 --> 00:06:36,891
Of course you will not be able to to produce me down.

70
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:42,048
But do your best. Your very best!

71
00:06:43,128 --> 00:06:45,407
It is the road to success!

72
00:06:54,764 --> 00:06:56,603
Do not drive on!

73
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,419
A satisfied grin. - The Miser saved money to travel.

74
00:08:01,698 --> 00:08:06,376
Is this a hospital? - It is a new research institute.

75
00:08:06,776 --> 00:08:10,495
There are only doctors and volunteers.

76
00:08:10,974 --> 00:08:14,573
Ice. Please indicate, if you need the phone.

77
00:08:35,325 --> 00:08:37,644
Hello, I'm Dr. Reisner.

78
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:41,802
I'm ... - You came early.

79
00:08:41,882 --> 00:08:45,321
You were supposed to come tomorrow. - I am sorry.

80
00:08:46,601 --> 00:08:48,440
Can I see the room?

81
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,079
Clara.

82
00:08:52,718 --> 00:08:56,077
This is a former hospital wing. Beware of puddles.

83
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:28,744
Here is some mistake. I'm a doctor, I do not ...

84
00:09:29,024 --> 00:09:31,943
You what? - I'm patient and I do not volunteer.

85
00:09:32,143 --> 00:09:35,822
Yes, I know it. You're Dr. Reisner.

86
00:09:36,102 --> 00:09:39,981
This is Reisner bed. those are other doctors beds.

87
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,099
Clara unload your belongings.

88
00:09:44,898 --> 00:09:49,216
Your colleagues are next door. Talk to each other, although the beds.

89
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:02,011
Days. I'm Dr. Reisner.

90
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:10,488
Are you doctors? Viewfinder Weather-White doctors now.

91
00:10:10,768 --> 00:10:14,487
You are looking for and found. - He is not down.

92
00:10:15,806 --> 00:10:18,245
Bacteriology. - Cardiology.

93
00:10:19,045 --> 00:10:23,203
Physiology, humeral region. - Physiology, humeral region.

94
00:10:23,483 --> 00:10:24,922
You too?

95
00:10:25,123 --> 00:10:28,682
Physiology, cardiology, bacteriology, pathology ...

96
00:10:29,001 --> 00:10:31,440
And a dose of rheumatic fever.

97
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,959
He did not believe me. - No, not yet.

98
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:39,877
I'm Felix Russell. For others clothing, you're almost naked.

99
00:10:41,956 --> 00:10:46,034
I do not know how to study attitude towards the roads.

100
00:10:46,514 --> 00:10:51,712
But in London, researchers have the lowest caste. Science is not art.

101
00:10:52,032 --> 00:10:55,711
Scientists just sit laboratories with machines.

102
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,310
The machines are considered vulgar.

103
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,469
That is, the layout will help. - It is necessary!

104
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:03,548
A nice one. - Exactly.

105
00:11:03,908 --> 00:11:06,907
The whole building is as yet no money.

106
00:11:09,945 --> 00:11:12,864
This better toys is not nobody.

107
00:11:17,742 --> 00:11:19,261
Reisner ...

108
00:11:20,022 --> 00:11:23,781
Are you Jewish? While it would not matter.

109
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,220
Yes I am.

110
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:29,937
Who is this laboratory? - Mine. You need to be there.

111
00:11:31,337 --> 00:11:36,255
It's ... We did not know, are you good. That's why you got the smallest.

112
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:39,054
Maybe things will change. - Maybe so.

113
00:11:48,131 --> 00:11:51,690
Electric chair that converts into a horseless vaunuksi.

114
00:11:51,849 --> 00:11:54,528
Friends with you can fit aboard.

115
00:11:55,408 --> 00:12:00,366
I collect these, future machinery models.

116
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:05,404
Who is that little nook? - All of us, once a week.

117
00:12:05,604 --> 00:12:08,323
You must however, still have to wait your turn.

118
00:12:11,882 --> 00:12:13,921
The time of this public space.

119
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,398
But everyone knows the doctors, what the girl looks like.

120
00:12:20,798 --> 00:12:22,637
At least I hope so.

121
00:12:23,197 --> 00:12:28,155
I went to this one officer's house. Although it should perhaps be mentioned.

122
00:12:28,555 --> 00:12:33,233
He barked doctors thrown bad language. He has lost two brothers.

123
00:13:15,497 --> 00:13:17,256
Welcome.

124
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:21,415
This is an honor for me. I did not know that you are ...

125
00:13:21,615 --> 00:13:26,973
Not coming not engender the sense of honor. I wanted to talk before the start of the work.

126
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:32,010
I want you to understand now the basic idea. You are free.

127
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:36,369
There is no order of the day, does not control.

128
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:39,848
Follow the instincts. If any.

129
00:13:40,367 --> 00:13:43,966
You can decide if the use of time, and I evaluation results.

130
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:47,565
It can happen at any time.

131
00:13:48,764 --> 00:13:53,842
I remember a job interview. The physiology of the examination is sufficient.

132
00:13:54,682 --> 00:13:56,561
You do not need luck.

133
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,439
You're here so far.

134
00:14:04,998 --> 00:14:06,797
Until I decide otherwise.

135
00:14:17,313 --> 00:14:22,351
James is a laboratory assistants. And me and Russell.

136
00:14:23,551 --> 00:14:26,550
Is this your first day with? - It is.

137
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:30,868
James is surprisingly good.

138
00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:38,545
Anywhere else they can not be help.

139
00:14:38,985 --> 00:14:41,304
What drug was it?

140
00:14:41,984 --> 00:14:45,463
Thank you, Doctor. I would not have survived without you.

141
00:14:45,942 --> 00:14:47,182
Tongue out.

142
00:14:48,741 --> 00:14:50,021
Wait a minute.

143
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:55,419
What do you say Reisner? - Who gave this?

144
00:14:55,578 --> 00:14:59,177
All the same, it, as long as you stop its use. It is harmful.

145
00:15:11,212 --> 00:15:13,531
I need a base solution.

146
00:15:14,171 --> 00:15:17,810
And thyroid malt. Hurry.

147
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,768
Oh, is that you?

148
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,607
Laboratory work. I thought that the... - Instead of beds.

149
00:15:26,766 --> 00:15:30,764
I will do even more between. - Not both would do.

150
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:37,283
You are afraid that infect diseases. You can of course made up each of your mind.

151
00:15:39,482 --> 00:15:42,121
Consider the matter. Will be announced later.

152
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:49,598
This can be a dangerous place.

153
00:15:49,838 --> 00:15:54,636
Infections spread easily. Take care of cleanliness.

154
00:15:55,036 --> 00:15:57,915
Yours also. - I promise.

155
00:15:58,074 --> 00:16:02,632
Washed before purine your bags. You do not get an infection.

156
00:16:02,992 --> 00:16:07,590
At least not from me. - Soothing data.

157
00:16:14,588 --> 00:16:18,067
I've been doing well without your advice.

158
00:16:18,147 --> 00:16:19,866
He does not stand up.

159
00:16:21,985 --> 00:16:25,704
This is haimauutetta. for the treatment of diabetes.

160
00:16:28,703 --> 00:16:29,943
Do not be sad.

161
00:16:30,742 --> 00:16:33,461
Look up. Your blood sugar will not be allowed to fall.

162
00:16:36,979 --> 00:16:38,698
Look up.

163
00:16:39,378 --> 00:16:42,497
Have you gone mad? Does not produce a vaccine can be used.

164
00:16:44,057 --> 00:16:45,057
Wait a minute.

165
00:16:47,415 --> 00:16:51,613
They are my subjects. Do not interfere with the work of a colleague.

166
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:55,252
The vaccine is completely unpredictable!

167
00:17:10,726 --> 00:17:16,284
Did you go to access the colleague. It is unheard of.

168
00:17:16,924 --> 00:17:21,042
He prescribes treatment could have been fatal.

169
00:17:21,882 --> 00:17:27,000
Untreated haimauute is been shown to be unreliable in use.

170
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:32,158
This gentleman ... is a phone call.

171
00:17:32,878 --> 00:17:36,876
I do not have time to come. Ask the caller to order.

172
00:17:37,196 --> 00:17:40,635
Go ahead, that was it.

173
00:17:44,673 --> 00:17:45,992
So, Dad?

174
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:50,751
You knew who to call. - Who else? What's the matter with you?

175
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:54,270
I want to know, of course, how are you doing.

176
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:58,109
Tell the details. The details!

177
00:17:58,788 --> 00:18:01,987
This is a bad time. - Details!

178
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:03,666
The duration of one minute.

179
00:18:04,026 --> 00:18:06,425
Be quiet! - I can not hear.

180
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:08,104
Everything is fine.

181
00:18:08,384 --> 00:18:11,943
I'm busy, I have now stopped.

182
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:23,618
Everything is fine. And also long-distance calls are successful.

183
00:18:24,578 --> 00:18:28,137
If only not only have to shout so loud.

184
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:35,654
Gentlemen! Sign thing is forgotten.

185
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:42,531
So we can come back normal order.

186
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,289
All is forgotten.

187
00:18:54,326 --> 00:18:56,285
Doctor! Come on!

188
00:19:02,843 --> 00:19:04,202
Edwin poor.

189
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:08,241
I'm serious. - How come?

190
00:19:09,361 --> 00:19:13,559
Him was not anything. Here's how it works.

191
00:19:17,717 --> 00:19:19,516
You take his place.

192
00:19:19,597 --> 00:19:22,716
Kisastamme should be fun. You are ambitious!

193
00:19:23,315 --> 00:19:25,354
This is a great place.

194
00:19:30,273 --> 00:19:34,391
But I may not yet dry. - You do not even close.

195
00:19:52,344 --> 00:19:53,783
James. - So?

196
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,502
The case is sensitive, but I ask anyway.

197
00:19:58,662 --> 00:20:02,101
Now that I'm still here. The room ...

198
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:09,018
It cubicle ... In the evening, it's my turn. - I could wait for your question.

199
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:14,735
Do you happen to know a suitable partner? A woman who ...

200
00:20:15,015 --> 00:20:18,854
Strange that all talking about sex nowadays.

201
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:22,093
Last year, 2 000 flyers -

202
00:20:22,213 --> 00:20:26,211
heterosexually, internal classes about sex.

203
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:29,570
Instructive. But hardly useful.

204
00:20:30,489 --> 00:20:34,368
I may know a suitable person. - Maybe.

205
00:20:36,287 --> 00:20:38,006
How am I proceed?

206
00:20:38,486 --> 00:20:42,484
Do you want to organize it all? - Only the awkward stage.

207
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:46,723
Get him out. At a minimum, for a walk.

208
00:20:47,523 --> 00:20:49,122
I pay him?

209
00:20:50,602 --> 00:20:53,201
He expects payment?

210
00:21:02,757 --> 00:21:03,877
Hello.

211
00:21:05,756 --> 00:21:07,515
Reisner, you.

212
00:21:13,793 --> 00:21:15,112
Hi dad.

213
00:21:16,392 --> 00:21:20,990
It is good to hear your voice, but I have right now in a hurry.

214
00:21:56,296 --> 00:22:01,334
The left is menstruating and tuskittelee with the bandage.

215
00:22:01,774 --> 00:22:06,652
Felix, please, with us is a woman. - Thank you but the thing that interests me.

216
00:22:06,852 --> 00:22:11,090
Löytyyköhän menstrual Never relief? - Inevitably.

217
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:15,689
women fear while being exposed as a leak.

218
00:22:16,489 --> 00:22:21,327
The solution can be found, as long as someone to focus on the issue.

219
00:22:21,527 --> 00:22:24,126
Is that what you study the secret?

220
00:22:24,206 --> 00:22:26,405
I do not. At least not yet.

221
00:22:28,324 --> 00:22:32,163
Why do you think that the studied something to hide? You do not know everything.

222
00:22:34,122 --> 00:22:37,321
Already at a young age fared medical researcher.

223
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,239
First female assistant hired man.

224
00:22:41,479 --> 00:22:43,838
And even a black man. - Oh, really?

225
00:22:46,277 --> 00:22:50,076
Are you busy tonight? - How so busy?

226
00:22:51,835 --> 00:22:53,234
I'm not.

227
00:22:53,594 --> 00:22:57,672
Could we meet? - How close?

228
00:22:58,992 --> 00:23:03,510
Just to meet. - Or meet. Where?

229
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:09,148
I could take you out to dinner and ... - And what?

230
00:23:10,268 --> 00:23:12,547
Is not infectious worries anymore?

231
00:23:12,867 --> 00:23:14,746
Agree, an experienced woman.

232
00:23:14,946 --> 00:23:19,104
I mean dinner. And then... - And then the curtain booth.

233
00:23:22,183 --> 00:23:24,502
I may be old-fashioned -

234
00:23:24,982 --> 00:23:28,900
but I like the meals, which does not have to pay.

235
00:23:32,139 --> 00:23:34,098
These are not needed.

236
00:23:36,258 --> 00:23:40,216
Villieläinuutetta. Directly charlatan bag.

237
00:23:49,693 --> 00:23:54,971
Would be better, if the gloves do not have holes.

238
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:56,810
Doctor!

239
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:58,610
Doctor!

240
00:23:58,969 --> 00:24:03,407
You forgot the benefactor of the widow?

241
00:24:04,447 --> 00:24:07,886
He has a lot of power in this house. - Oh, my God.

242
00:24:08,205 --> 00:24:10,204
Quickest way to get there.

243
00:24:11,204 --> 00:24:12,523
It is a shortcut.

244
00:24:13,643 --> 00:24:16,162
Go ahead! It is the best route.

245
00:25:12,381 --> 00:25:13,980
I apologize.

246
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,820
Sit down.

247
00:25:18,898 --> 00:25:22,257
Do you all as young? - I'm not very young.

248
00:25:22,537 --> 00:25:26,655
My husband saw the mind bearded doctors.

249
00:25:27,455 --> 00:25:33,733
While contributing to the money he imagined valuable bearded professors.

250
00:25:34,012 --> 00:25:37,771
But the professors is only one, the rest are day-old chicks.

251
00:25:38,131 --> 00:25:42,169
This is a new branch of science. - Is it science?

252
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:49,126
... Inherited properties improvement, better people.

253
00:25:49,366 --> 00:25:53,245
It is a race doctrine.

254
00:25:54,684 --> 00:25:59,042
How do we get the best individuals to mate?

255
00:25:59,363 --> 00:26:02,682
Hopefully the rules are complied with.

256
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:07,759
And the animals are treated well. - Absolutely.

257
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:13,957
The rats were allowed to do anything, but not the more advanced animals.

258
00:26:14,597 --> 00:26:21,874
Monkeys, dogs, rabbits. They should not be a plant.

259
00:26:23,273 --> 00:26:26,112
No they are not, I guarantee it.

260
00:26:26,592 --> 00:26:27,752
Good.

261
00:26:28,511 --> 00:26:33,589
best inheritables People do not come from poor parts.

262
00:26:35,509 --> 00:26:39,627
Multi-growing human being is unable to provide for themselves.

263
00:26:39,827 --> 00:26:43,346
You're the best now. You and the other guy.

264
00:26:43,546 --> 00:26:47,305
You have to hear her, too ascendant. - Who told you?

265
00:26:47,624 --> 00:26:52,022
Do not pretend that you do not know. Top Picks ...

266
00:26:54,102 --> 00:26:56,021
I really do not know.

267
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:03,858
An effective cancer medication. Predict.

268
00:27:04,098 --> 00:27:05,897
By 1959 at the latest.

269
00:27:06,017 --> 00:27:10,975
All syöpiinkö? - It will take more time, at least 70 years.

270
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:17,333
Multi overcome the disease. Flunssakin, no later than August 1940.

271
00:27:17,812 --> 00:27:23,250
No, communicable diseases can not be reached. When one is defeated, the other spreads.

272
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:28,968
Diabetes medicine is unlikely to be found in this century.

273
00:27:29,568 --> 00:27:31,567
What century is this?

274
00:27:32,527 --> 00:27:36,286
I believe, that the drug is invented soon.

275
00:27:36,645 --> 00:27:38,644
Shortcut was good.

276
00:27:39,844 --> 00:27:43,123
I had a feeling the benefits. - You will be by only.

277
00:27:48,401 --> 00:27:50,480
Reisner, to participate you too.

278
00:27:51,239 --> 00:27:56,237
Will the lives of people healthier and longer, or not?

279
00:28:00,036 --> 00:28:01,236
I think ...

280
00:28:03,035 --> 00:28:05,074
I believe that the...

281
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:12,192
not imagining advances imagination enough.

282
00:28:14,511 --> 00:28:18,629
The life expectancy will rise Forecast a hundred years during the 50 years.

283
00:28:19,309 --> 00:28:22,588
And more. Thus, I believe.

284
00:28:27,825 --> 00:28:29,624
You get to the exit.

285
00:28:33,903 --> 00:28:35,742
Except for Paul.

286
00:28:43,579 --> 00:28:47,218
You are eligible researcher. - Oh thank you.

287
00:28:48,258 --> 00:28:49,418
Thanks.

288
00:28:52,256 --> 00:28:55,375
You are quite humble beginnings, or what?

289
00:28:55,815 --> 00:29:00,453
Scottish Jews, originally from Romania. - Exactly.

290
00:29:03,332 --> 00:29:09,530
In you have an edge, but do not change anymore nenäkkäämmäksi.

291
00:29:10,729 --> 00:29:14,727
What can I say? - Just answer my question.

292
00:29:15,447 --> 00:29:17,926
Do you want to work with me?

293
00:29:21,645 --> 00:29:23,924
That would be answered in the affirmative.

294
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:10,306
There is no need to imitate me in everything. - Just me foreign affairs.

295
00:30:16,264 --> 00:30:24,061
Father good, the rush to press, and the visit is not the time.

296
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:29,778
Housing was the only improve. I believe that ilahtuisit.

297
00:30:31,018 --> 00:30:36,456
With little free time going around with a Russian count's daughter.

298
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:41,773
She is beautiful. A wealthy and temperamental.

299
00:30:42,254 --> 00:30:46,252
"He lives in a large house In Richmond. "

300
00:30:47,092 --> 00:30:50,011
Handwriting is reduced, but the news improved.

301
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:55,648
Come and get summer fruits This year, Mr. Willett!

302
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:58,407
You can choose from.

303
00:30:58,687 --> 00:31:00,606
Even a Jew.

304
00:31:00,726 --> 00:31:03,765
We choose the best for him.

305
00:31:04,645 --> 00:31:07,484
Then he can not be relentlessly.

306
00:31:07,644 --> 00:31:09,643
Continue reading.

307
00:31:11,682 --> 00:31:16,960
The best part is good välini Professor Mandry.

308
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:22,278
Our relationship to get better day by day. To make progress at an astonishing rate.

309
00:31:23,118 --> 00:31:27,676
I guess now the foremost researcher. Even my friend Felix sharper.

310
00:31:28,316 --> 00:31:31,315
I am no longer a professor pupil, but a colleague.

311
00:31:31,715 --> 00:31:34,594
A friend even. I can say what I want.

312
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:40,231
He is a fine man, interested in societal issues.

313
00:31:41,871 --> 00:31:44,870
It is a great honor to be in his presence.

314
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:37,569
What a day.

315
00:32:43,607 --> 00:32:47,086
They are increasing, even though unable to provide for their children.

316
00:32:47,525 --> 00:32:51,324
I do not think the increase can not forcibly stopped.

317
00:32:51,764 --> 00:32:53,004
Of course not.

318
00:32:57,681 --> 00:33:01,520
Of course not. - Of course it can.

319
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:06,997
The key of success is education. That's what you have control over.

320
00:33:07,758 --> 00:33:11,876
Better than anyone. - Who says so?

321
00:33:12,676 --> 00:33:14,075
Yourself.

322
00:33:17,834 --> 00:33:23,632
Perhaps there should be no return for a while. We work too hard.

323
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,189
It is possible.

324
00:33:30,149 --> 00:33:32,308
Let's go already!

325
00:33:42,584 --> 00:33:45,463
You came after all. - Didi liked.

326
00:33:47,382 --> 00:33:49,381
Curiosity won.

327
00:33:50,141 --> 00:33:56,698
I apologize for my clumsiness. My actions are rude.

328
00:34:03,016 --> 00:34:07,574
You are of course beautiful anyway, but ... - You did not want that nolaan you.

329
00:34:07,934 --> 00:34:11,133
There is no question of it. The dress was just a beautiful miracle.

330
00:34:11,213 --> 00:34:14,372
I can not use it myself, at least not today ...

331
00:34:16,331 --> 00:34:19,010
The rude act, undeniably.

332
00:34:22,209 --> 00:34:24,008
And at the same time admirable.

333
00:34:26,487 --> 00:34:29,926
You knew my size. - Doctor of experience.

334
00:34:31,485 --> 00:34:36,203
This at first glance. - Let's see, osuitko right.

335
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,799
Do not wait any longer. - A couple of minutes, please.

336
00:34:47,999 --> 00:34:52,797
What he leaves her dress your own? - Cabinet will.

337
00:34:52,997 --> 00:34:55,316
Thy house?

338
00:34:55,596 --> 00:34:58,835
That is not possible. - The closet of the corridor.

339
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:12,389
You were wrong. It does not sit.

340
00:35:12,549 --> 00:35:14,268
That's enough! - Does not it?

341
00:35:14,509 --> 00:35:16,868
I could be wrong.

342
00:35:18,067 --> 00:35:25,664
It is ... rented. That, too, the matter was mentioned.

343
00:35:26,864 --> 00:35:32,062
I never thought you bought the. Iltahan may fail.

344
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:40,418
We ylipukeutuneita. - Where are we going?

345
00:35:43,218 --> 00:35:45,857
I know. This way.

346
00:35:53,454 --> 00:35:55,893
Felix, I can not stand any longer.

347
00:35:56,492 --> 00:35:59,371
Reveal your research now.

348
00:36:01,611 --> 00:36:07,089
The subject is certainly one of, which no one else to investigate.

349
00:36:08,248 --> 00:36:10,447
Deny, and you're dead. - I forbid.

350
00:36:10,567 --> 00:36:13,406
It is associated with diabetes. - It is likewise.

351
00:36:13,566 --> 00:36:15,805
Hormones, glands.

352
00:36:15,925 --> 00:36:18,324
The glands produce a substance ...

353
00:36:18,764 --> 00:36:23,162
Ainettako? - Do not repeat the suit, but listen.

354
00:36:23,402 --> 00:36:27,840
The substance is carried through the bloodstream through where it affects.

355
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,919
This is a coordinated system. - Or is it?

356
00:36:33,118 --> 00:36:37,356
I believe that the brain is regulating the operation of an important gland.

357
00:36:37,877 --> 00:36:40,036
I will try to prove it.

358
00:36:40,675 --> 00:36:46,793
I think I can isolate pancreatic secretions chemically.

359
00:36:47,033 --> 00:36:50,352
Diabetes would then be treatable.

360
00:36:50,592 --> 00:36:53,351
Beyond belief. - Revolutionary.

361
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:56,949
What do you think? Tell. - I wonder.

362
00:36:58,309 --> 00:37:03,307
I'm not saying that I wish I had invented it yourself. - Because you could not have.

363
00:37:03,507 --> 00:37:07,825
I'm supposed to believe that the matter you should consider. And I do not think so.

364
00:37:08,225 --> 00:37:09,744
What do you say?

365
00:37:09,824 --> 00:37:11,663
Sky, look at the dress.

366
00:37:13,223 --> 00:37:15,222
I forgot the whole dress.

367
00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:27,697
It's been an hour. Admit already that the idea is good.

368
00:37:28,257 --> 00:37:30,696
Or do you still believe?

369
00:38:06,962 --> 00:38:09,681
future clothing

370
00:38:31,153 --> 00:38:35,431
men are forced to fight paritteluoikeudesta?

371
00:38:36,511 --> 00:38:40,709
Perhaps the most engaging medieval lugs.

372
00:38:42,429 --> 00:38:45,268
Will there be a battle of shoes? Kill Shoes?

373
00:38:45,827 --> 00:38:50,985
Or do we live in harmony? Are we tolerant, loving even?

374
00:38:52,265 --> 00:38:57,143
After all, we are tolerant. Or what?

375
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:07,259
That factor is to have the fish.

376
00:39:49,243 --> 00:39:52,962
Paris has presented a moving staircase.

377
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:56,840
Harrods department store already has one. The inventor angle.

378
00:39:59,479 --> 00:40:04,037
Professor Mandry. Alopecia estoseerumi.

379
00:40:04,357 --> 00:40:09,875
I figured out more than that. Atlantic below the the tunnel, which is run over a hundred.

380
00:40:10,035 --> 00:40:11,994
Free doctors.

381
00:40:12,154 --> 00:40:15,793
Your doctor will check being of workers in the morning on buses.

382
00:40:15,992 --> 00:40:18,271
This is the year of magic.

383
00:40:20,111 --> 00:40:25,309
Balloon villas. - Urban above. Air Camps.

384
00:40:26,149 --> 00:40:28,228
What if all should be fulfilled?

385
00:40:28,508 --> 00:40:32,387
Someone comes up with a vision of the phone. The father should be like that.

386
00:40:32,626 --> 00:40:35,705
My invention already exists. Believe it.

387
00:40:38,224 --> 00:40:41,183
Do not think about him. I'm surprised.

388
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:46,580
He is on the lower level. It does not not worth it, even for one night.

389
00:41:00,415 --> 00:41:02,134
the scent of summer.

390
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:05,653
Heat...

391
00:41:10,292 --> 00:41:13,011
The last year of the century, and it is hot.

392
00:41:19,168 --> 00:41:22,567
Part of the city of the future is in my hand.

393
00:41:23,686 --> 00:41:24,806
Felix.

394
00:41:26,405 --> 00:41:28,084
Now, I'm convinced.

395
00:41:29,284 --> 00:41:31,203
It happened a moment ago.

396
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:37,521
I do not want to recognize, I thought it was the best facility.

397
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:42,079
But I present it with you Mandry, if you tell me about it.

398
00:41:42,279 --> 00:41:45,438
The work will then be all mine. - Of course.

399
00:41:46,158 --> 00:41:50,596
My sentence can be dangerous and customary. - Like you.

400
00:41:50,876 --> 00:41:54,755
I was saying that the coming is the most exciting night of my life.

401
00:41:56,114 --> 00:41:58,593
Maybe it is. - Let's hope.

402
00:41:59,553 --> 00:42:01,352
I walk home alone?

403
00:42:02,711 --> 00:42:06,949
It does not matter so much, yes but you get to come. - Tuonneko?

404
00:42:08,709 --> 00:42:12,268
Exactly. Edit the route does not exist.

405
00:42:13,827 --> 00:42:15,107
No thanks.

406
00:42:17,466 --> 00:42:22,344
I have to talk with Felix. - I understand. Thanks for the evening.

407
00:42:24,783 --> 00:42:27,782
Do you want to dress back now? - Do not hupsuttele.

408
00:42:28,142 --> 00:42:31,221
Hopefully you do not have to redeem it.

409
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,979
Keep in mind, that you had the opportunity.

410
00:42:42,736 --> 00:42:46,854
It has typos. - We were in a hurry.

411
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:51,612
The performance is vast.

412
00:42:55,851 --> 00:42:59,849
What do you think? - Just uncommon ideas.

413
00:43:01,609 --> 00:43:07,127
Which should be given join all assets. The study may be significant.

414
00:43:08,246 --> 00:43:12,005
Not only for us, but also the body.

415
00:43:13,044 --> 00:43:15,803
Press will be interested in the matter.

416
00:43:22,241 --> 00:43:26,879
I, too, the ideas are interesting.

417
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:30,317
Perhaps even groundbreaking.

418
00:43:31,597 --> 00:43:37,235
I will get back to. Do not talk about this.

419
00:43:43,632 --> 00:43:49,390
Dr Makin United States and Dr. Leisen from Germany.

420
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:52,149
Good evening.

421
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:54,748
Soon, Paul. Very soon.

422
00:44:02,945 --> 00:44:06,824
I read the Washington-acquaintance the study.

423
00:44:08,263 --> 00:44:13,981
I think it was a lack of evidence. - So it often is.

424
00:44:14,301 --> 00:44:19,419
Professor Mandry. - Now is a bad time.

425
00:44:21,378 --> 00:44:23,897
He is too often picnics.

426
00:44:29,455 --> 00:44:33,334
Still no feedback, not any.

427
00:44:51,366 --> 00:44:56,044
It must not be fooled. He always affects thoughtful.

428
00:44:57,004 --> 00:45:00,083
I would myself to learn the skill.

429
00:45:01,882 --> 00:45:06,240
Why do not you comment on the report? - What do you mean?

430
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,319
We need our show. - It is wide.

431
00:45:11,718 --> 00:45:16,076
It is Reisner and Russell an interesting essay.

432
00:45:16,876 --> 00:45:20,675
I have read it only three times. That's a lot to think about.

433
00:45:21,355 --> 00:45:24,674
I do not want to discuss it now. I must inform you when I'm ready.

434
00:45:24,833 --> 00:45:27,192
I take the course seriously.

435
00:45:27,432 --> 00:45:30,911
Why it was a cleaning cupboard? - Therefore, I searched for it.

436
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:37,108
the level of cleaning to keep apparently improve. I like the matter in my mind.

437
00:45:37,309 --> 00:45:40,468
You did not leave it there? - I do not.

438
00:45:41,027 --> 00:45:44,386
-Then Get it back. Thanks.

439
00:45:44,786 --> 00:45:50,504
I feel like, that do you avoid reading it.

440
00:45:50,783 --> 00:45:54,462
Do not jankkaa. - Unforgivable argument.

441
00:45:55,662 --> 00:46:01,260
I have always supported you and contributed to your career.

442
00:46:03,019 --> 00:46:06,458
You now have the best to remain silent. Do you understand?

443
00:46:06,657 --> 00:46:10,216
I just want to know the reason for the delay.

444
00:46:12,255 --> 00:46:14,294
Reisner, up.

445
00:46:16,134 --> 00:46:17,973
Get up.

446
00:46:21,851 --> 00:46:27,929
For a month banned. You'll also lose a month's wages.

447
00:46:28,409 --> 00:46:32,727
When you return, you start your original laboratory.

448
00:46:33,447 --> 00:46:36,846
I do not want to see you months.

449
00:46:38,205 --> 00:46:41,724
And do not argue. Exit.

450
00:46:44,003 --> 00:46:45,842
Where is Clara? - Offline.

451
00:46:45,962 --> 00:46:49,281
He is always here. - He is on vacation. I do not know where.

452
00:46:49,361 --> 00:46:51,640
You need to know. - I do not know.

453
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:55,718
Where he lives? Tell!

454
00:47:31,305 --> 00:47:32,624
Clara!

455
00:47:33,344 --> 00:47:35,623
Here you are. Thank God.

456
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:39,102
So, fortunately, the address was correct.

457
00:47:39,222 --> 00:47:42,821
Did not you glad to see me? - Of course, I was delighted.

458
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:46,699
What Doctors effort?

459
00:47:48,058 --> 00:47:51,937
Little problem with the professor. I went too far.

460
00:47:52,137 --> 00:47:56,016
I thought I was a review above, because I am able.

461
00:47:56,375 --> 00:48:02,053
Everything will be yes, because he likes me. - Of course.

462
00:48:04,732 --> 00:48:08,411
You stole these devices? - I do not, of course.

463
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:15,288
And won only half. The rest are defective.

464
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:18,206
What are you doing?

465
00:48:18,486 --> 00:48:22,484
May I kiss you? - Doctor is good.

466
00:48:23,045 --> 00:48:25,724
Do not call me Doctor.

467
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:38,718
I'm hoping this first moment. - Valetta.

468
00:48:40,518 --> 00:48:45,796
You think you should be gloves when touching assistants.

469
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:28,179
Do you still want gloves?

470
00:49:29,419 --> 00:49:33,817
This is what I am. - I see no reason for concern.

471
00:49:34,497 --> 00:49:36,456
Oh, thank you, Doctor.

472
00:49:38,456 --> 00:49:43,334
What about you? I had already decided to quit.

473
00:49:44,333 --> 00:49:46,652
Especially with doctors.

474
00:49:47,052 --> 00:49:50,051
Your decision can not relate to me.

475
00:49:50,851 --> 00:49:52,011
At least not now.

476
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:55,609
Do too cocky you.

477
00:50:01,687 --> 00:50:04,526
Doctors had only one.

478
00:50:32,795 --> 00:50:35,074
Always prepare this range.

479
00:50:35,394 --> 00:50:39,312
The body was a Chinese assistant. He advised me.

480
00:50:39,512 --> 00:50:44,430
Chinese food. Kind of. - The extra-sighted.

481
00:50:49,988 --> 00:50:54,226
Surprisingly tasty. Although special.

482
00:50:54,826 --> 00:50:59,184
It appeals only to the best the taste nerves. So as you.

483
00:50:59,784 --> 00:51:00,824
Exactly.

484
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:07,301
Forget about the medicine and take to savor the cuisine of the future.

485
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:15,178
Opium users. Here lives a lot of bohemians and wanderers.

486
00:51:16,018 --> 00:51:18,417
Are up to no matter what the curtains open.

487
00:51:20,057 --> 00:51:21,896
I have one question.

488
00:51:24,495 --> 00:51:27,934
Why does someone like you ... - Smart woman.

489
00:51:29,533 --> 00:51:32,692
Working in a laboratory as an assistant, Really?

490
00:51:33,491 --> 00:51:36,530
I thought I heard in danger of death.

491
00:51:41,248 --> 00:51:43,567
Since I gave birth to a child.

492
00:51:45,207 --> 00:51:48,846
Without a husband and without money.

493
00:51:50,445 --> 00:51:53,204
Then there was no longer last of it.

494
00:51:55,163 --> 00:51:57,362
It's an ordinary story.

495
00:51:57,762 --> 00:52:03,080
Except I did not abject towards I do not ask the department rewarding.

496
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,559
What happened to the child?

497
00:52:07,078 --> 00:52:08,597
The child died.

498
00:52:10,917 --> 00:52:14,716
Influenza Infectious deprived it of the spirit in eight hours.

499
00:52:15,075 --> 00:52:16,754
My condolences.

500
00:52:21,553 --> 00:52:24,672
It was my creation.

501
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:29,510
Although not think so.

502
00:52:31,149 --> 00:52:32,908
Do you want to stay here?

503
00:52:34,828 --> 00:52:39,026
Although is it you seem to be place else. - Not so.

504
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:58,019
See that James considered slides concern.

505
00:52:58,099 --> 00:53:00,418
An interesting list of subjects.

506
00:53:00,498 --> 00:53:02,857
Write up information, So secretly.

507
00:53:02,937 --> 00:53:05,296
Changes and that sort of thing.

508
00:53:05,496 --> 00:53:09,015
I know what I'm looking for. I have kept my eyes open.

509
00:53:10,454 --> 00:53:12,253
Paul Reisner!

510
00:53:12,973 --> 00:53:14,692
Paul Reisner!

511
00:53:15,772 --> 00:53:17,611
Paul! There you are.

512
00:53:18,051 --> 00:53:20,610
How are you? Have you forgotten everything?

513
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:24,969
Go away! We should not even be discussed.

514
00:53:25,448 --> 00:53:30,406
You have fallen into the plot. - Yllätän you when I get back. And the professor.

515
00:53:31,126 --> 00:53:32,885
I can hardly wait.

516
00:53:42,522 --> 00:53:45,641
Those clothes suit you. - Yes.

517
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:52,278
Tell me who they are. - It does not belong to you. You'd be jealous.

518
00:54:01,394 --> 00:54:04,873
Will you be all right here? - Sure. I can put on our food.

519
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:14,469
Paul Reisner! - Get out!

520
00:54:17,108 --> 00:54:22,626
I thought already, that we were come to the wrong place.

521
00:54:33,062 --> 00:54:35,941
A very special environment.

522
00:54:36,261 --> 00:54:40,060
Yes, but the explanation is simple.

523
00:54:47,217 --> 00:54:54,054
Tell. - I'll get them. In return I get to wash up here.

524
00:54:54,814 --> 00:54:59,132
Jack. - Room a an older woman -

525
00:54:59,412 --> 00:55:03,970
which conducts research in his spare time.

526
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:09,688
It is easy to get excited about. - Why do you have those kinds of clothes?

527
00:55:10,568 --> 00:55:15,366
Merge them better. - It is not the recommended approach.

528
00:55:17,445 --> 00:55:22,283
The clothes are ridiculous. - I can not be bothered to explain.

529
00:55:23,923 --> 00:55:30,161
Let's go to lunch. Or a cup of coffee. London gets a good coffee.

530
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,599
No no no. - How come?

531
00:55:32,919 --> 00:55:37,597
Introduce Research Institute. - Impossible, it is closed.

532
00:55:37,797 --> 00:55:42,835
Rubbish! Shoes suddenly. And drive your beard.

533
00:55:43,755 --> 00:55:45,514
We're going the same road.

534
00:56:07,866 --> 00:56:11,345
Dr. Reisner, a piece of you already. - Just keep on working.

535
00:56:11,544 --> 00:56:13,863
Where is the lab? - What?

536
00:56:15,863 --> 00:56:17,862
Use it the old.

537
00:56:24,139 --> 00:56:28,977
These are covered with dust. - It is an advantage in certain tests.

538
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:34,096
Testing must be done under all conditions.

539
00:56:38,494 --> 00:56:40,373
Where is your apartment?

540
00:56:44,531 --> 00:56:48,889
Paul! Have you gone mad? Mandry was in earnest.

541
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:52,729
The work progressed faster than I imagined.

542
00:56:52,888 --> 00:56:56,407
Felix is ​​a bit special. Do not mind.

543
00:56:59,126 --> 00:57:01,485
Come on. Here. Come on!

544
00:57:08,322 --> 00:57:09,921
Dr. Reisner.

545
00:57:12,161 --> 00:57:13,800
A woman is calling you.

546
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,679
It is his way. Let him be just.

547
00:57:17,879 --> 00:57:20,998
Do not pay attention to him.

548
00:57:26,355 --> 00:57:28,034
Reisner.

549
00:57:29,434 --> 00:57:30,594
Days.

550
00:57:31,153 --> 00:57:34,152
I want to explain. I'm not really here.

551
00:57:36,272 --> 00:57:40,310
Father wanted to see research institute. I'm not here.

552
00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:44,549
It is a pleasure to meet your father. Days.

553
00:57:45,068 --> 00:57:47,187
It is my pleasure.

554
00:57:49,586 --> 00:57:51,105
I have something to say.

555
00:57:56,824 --> 00:58:00,663
I told you so? - I know, but I already explained.

556
00:58:02,381 --> 00:58:05,860
You left only a week ago. Do not you believe me?

557
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:11,938
I thought, I'm not stupid. Father is the only hard to resist.

558
00:58:15,896 --> 00:58:19,455
I am also sorry The rude language.

559
00:58:20,854 --> 00:58:22,533
Thoughtful.

560
00:58:24,333 --> 00:58:28,891
Downright elegant apology. The kind you wait too.

561
00:58:30,051 --> 00:58:33,730
I may take you back to the past. - I'd be grateful.

562
00:58:34,049 --> 00:58:41,566
But just me I get to take up your proposal.

563
00:58:44,125 --> 00:58:49,363
A special condition. When will you make the speech? - When I'm ready.

564
00:58:50,483 --> 00:58:54,561
No time limit, I do not give. It is the normal practice. - But ...

565
00:58:54,841 --> 00:58:58,200
Do not continue. I offer a second chance.

566
00:58:59,879 --> 00:59:02,318
Tutkimushan is not even yours.

567
00:59:02,438 --> 00:59:05,797
If you do not believe it, let us take it elsewhere.

568
00:59:05,957 --> 00:59:09,796
Out. Here, the work done is now the property.

569
00:59:10,195 --> 00:59:17,552
Only under these conditions you get to come back. The matter is closed.

570
00:59:20,032 --> 00:59:22,151
You must listen to me.

571
00:59:22,351 --> 00:59:27,989
An awe-inspiring condition. The study is published.

572
00:59:28,828 --> 00:59:32,866
If I were sure about your silence, I might agree.

573
00:59:33,306 --> 00:59:36,265
When? - When I looked into the matter.

574
00:59:36,465 --> 00:59:40,543
Postpone it again! You're jealous!

575
00:59:41,103 --> 00:59:44,182
The study merits are obvious.

576
00:59:44,782 --> 00:59:48,820
You want to cancel it! It is unforgivable!

577
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:55,498
Do not worry, they go to the scientific debate.

578
01:00:09,732 --> 01:00:15,850
Uhmasit me. - I apologize sävyäni.

579
01:00:17,649 --> 01:00:21,767
But research can not conceal. - This ends here.

580
01:00:24,966 --> 01:00:31,523
If you step foot in here at all, medical career is finished.

581
01:00:33,723 --> 01:00:39,201
You stay away from the other doctors. You must not stir up them.

582
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:44,998
I'll make sure you do not make any more medical research.

583
01:00:45,199 --> 01:00:48,358
You can not. - Do not forget who you are.

584
01:00:50,477 --> 01:00:56,635
One of you there is a difference of opinion. You do not have relations.

585
01:00:57,434 --> 01:00:58,993
Remember it.

586
01:01:00,033 --> 01:01:04,111
Please exit without saying a word.

587
01:01:04,751 --> 01:01:12,028
I think it clever. Did you like about me. Why did you do that?

588
01:01:13,908 --> 01:01:15,108
I...

589
01:01:16,227 --> 01:01:20,505
I can not believe this is happening. - You follow my instructions!

590
01:01:23,544 --> 01:01:27,822
You are insolent. Exit here!

591
01:01:29,142 --> 01:01:30,621
Get lost!

592
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:34,540
Come on.

593
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:36,419
No no no. Wait.

594
01:01:37,658 --> 01:01:44,295
The way I would like to invite you again. Come even village.

595
01:01:45,975 --> 01:01:52,652
The year of harvest of fruit is good. - Thank you. If I move there in the ...

596
01:01:54,092 --> 01:01:57,411
Pojallanne is relevant to you.

597
01:01:57,811 --> 01:02:03,529
I am glad my son's success. - Be quiet!

598
01:02:04,048 --> 01:02:06,567
Come now, we have to leave!

599
01:02:07,247 --> 01:02:09,886
What are you doing? - We have to go!

600
01:02:10,246 --> 01:02:12,405
I wish you had not come!

601
01:02:12,965 --> 01:02:17,643
What are you doing? I demand an explanation! What happened there?

602
01:02:19,362 --> 01:02:23,041
Kinastelitteko? Do not bicker with him.

603
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,520
What?

604
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:29,239
You misunderstood. - Explain.

605
01:02:32,757 --> 01:02:37,395
I might get a promotion, a research unit.

606
01:02:38,835 --> 01:02:45,193
The situation is sensitive. I did not want you meddling.

607
01:02:50,830 --> 01:02:52,189
You'll see yet.

608
01:03:00,467 --> 01:03:03,026
James, sit with me for tea.

609
01:03:23,498 --> 01:03:25,777
After all, come to me like that?

610
01:03:27,296 --> 01:03:29,615
The thought is daunting.

611
01:03:30,935 --> 01:03:32,614
After all, you do not know.

612
01:03:34,733 --> 01:03:38,252
Many are of the opinion, that already belong to them.

613
01:03:39,891 --> 01:03:42,410
"Clara has exceeded the limit."

614
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:46,689
I have now no other than you.

615
01:03:48,288 --> 01:03:53,006
Do not talk like that. That's not true.

616
01:03:55,245 --> 01:04:00,363
As soon as the problem will be solved, you leave me.

617
01:04:00,683 --> 01:04:03,482
And I do not leave. And why not?

618
01:04:03,682 --> 01:04:10,839
Because you can not change. You should happy with my kind.

619
01:04:13,239 --> 01:04:16,438
Can you imagine The designated rapporteur me to your father?

620
01:04:17,957 --> 01:04:22,755
I require only that you do not lie to me.

621
01:04:23,674 --> 01:04:29,352
If I do not get to use the word love, I then dependent on you.

622
01:04:30,632 --> 01:04:32,191
That's the way it is.

623
01:04:34,790 --> 01:04:36,149
We'll see.

624
01:04:37,229 --> 01:04:40,268
If we do not get to sleep again ...

625
01:04:40,908 --> 01:04:42,907
You are incorrigible.

626
01:04:43,467 --> 01:04:49,785
It started already. I would have to present, I do not enjoy sex.

627
01:04:51,864 --> 01:04:55,383
And again. I'm not supposed to talk about sex.

628
01:04:55,622 --> 01:04:57,221
You do so.

629
01:04:57,382 --> 01:05:01,061
I get at least some compensation, because you do not pay the rent.

630
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:04,859
Malta still a moment, if you can.

631
01:05:05,139 --> 01:05:07,618
What am I doing in terms of Mandry?

632
01:05:09,657 --> 01:05:14,695
after the breach, keep asking for forgiveness.

633
01:05:16,054 --> 01:05:18,373
Simplify. Apologize.

634
01:05:19,893 --> 01:05:24,451
Matele in the country, right in the country.

635
01:05:25,651 --> 01:05:29,330
Say that you were completely wrong.

636
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:35,127
Although I do not think you can.

637
01:06:06,595 --> 01:06:08,034
How are you?

638
01:06:12,473 --> 01:06:13,832
Avaapa mouth.

639
01:06:17,351 --> 01:06:22,229
Paul! What a creepy outfit. Just staggering.

640
01:06:23,508 --> 01:06:27,986
Your clothes are muddy. - Such is life in the city.

641
01:06:29,706 --> 01:06:34,064
You only have ridiculous costumes. They get dirty continuously.

642
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:40,142
We should introduce Research overalls. - A man has gone mad.

643
01:06:41,901 --> 01:06:46,339
After all, the modern workplace and very special, but that is too much.

644
01:06:46,859 --> 01:06:50,538
How do you stack up marginalized? - Okay.

I'm thinking crawl in front of Mandry.

646
01:06:55,296 --> 01:06:58,815
I promise to have a word to say without mentioning your research.

647

Do not worry, I've moved on to other kiintoista topics. - Its faith.

648
01:07:03,933 --> 01:07:07,092
My subject was too ambitious. - Was not.

We need your input. Although the granting of happens.

650
01:07:12,489 --> 01:07:15,448
I went again in his lecture.

651
01:07:15,808 --> 01:07:16,808
Good morning.

652
01:07:17,807 --> 01:07:20,966
How much time do we have? - About ten minutes.

653
01:07:24,525 --> 01:07:26,804
See who comes. Hide!

654
01:07:28,603 --> 01:07:32,162
Can he see me? It is this still missing.

655
01:07:32,282 --> 01:07:34,761
He would think that conspired.

656
01:07:38,279 --> 01:07:41,638

01:07:45,717 --> 01:07:48,316
Keep your mouth shut. Get lost!

659
01:07:48,596 --> 01:07:50,715
Another one of them? - Yes.

660
01:07:51,035 --> 01:07:55,073
They always call in the evening. Get rid of the phone.

661
01:07:55,473 --> 01:07:59,192
No no no. Everyone will receive such calls.

662
01:07:59,751 --> 01:08:03,829
It is a feature of the device.

663
01:08:04,629 --> 01:08:10,147
I wish you had not spoken Journal disparaging the city fathers.

664
01:08:10,467 --> 01:08:13,786
Come along to help with New Year's invitations.

665
01:08:14,426 --> 01:08:18,544
In last year's festivities look Successful completion of these compared.

666
01:08:18,864 --> 01:08:21,663
I concentrated on the design of the invitation.

667
01:08:23,422 --> 01:08:25,861
What do you say? - Oh, Dad.

668
01:08:34,698 --> 01:08:36,097
Dr. Reisner.

669
01:08:37,097 --> 01:08:39,816
Dr. Paul Reisner. - Yes. What is it?

670
01:08:40,096 --> 01:08:43,375
Come on, we need to talk. - What is it?

671
01:08:43,734 --> 01:08:46,853
A small interview only. Interview only.

672
01:08:47,813 --> 01:08:49,572
In an interview? - Yes.

673
01:08:49,972 --> 01:08:52,891
The journey is not long.

674
01:08:53,970 --> 01:08:56,289
Tell me now, What is it about.

675
01:09:03,047 --> 01:09:05,926

Are you looking for something special?

678
01:09:11,963 --> 01:09:15,282
Hello, Dr. Reisner. Please have a seat.

679
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,918
Perhaps you know that in preparation is the new Aliens Act, -

680
01:09:26,878 --> 01:09:31,236
to stanch the flood of unwanted materials.

681
01:09:31,516 --> 01:09:34,835
We are preparing the entry into force of the law.

682
01:09:35,234 --> 01:09:39,952
In spite of its name, the German your father was born in Romania.

683
01:09:40,232 --> 01:09:43,231
I guess I know it. - Multi disavow.

684
01:09:43,391 --> 01:09:45,190
Is not it interesting?

685
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:52,468
You were born in Scotland, did you livev in the
United States with the family

686
01:09:52,748 --> 01:09:57,266
now turned back to Scotland and did you come here to the south.

687
01:09:57,946 --> 01:10:01,465
How do you know? - We find out Only your family's steps.

688
01:10:01,904 --> 01:10:06,022
We will ensure that the procedures for there is no slippage at any stage.

689
01:10:06,182 --> 01:10:09,101
Is Mandry behind this?

690
01:10:15,499 --> 01:10:19,697
This is a personal vendetta. You do not have the power.

691
01:10:20,777 --> 01:10:25,455
You have no right to arrest me, as you know.

692
01:10:27,454 --> 01:10:28,654
Goodbye.

693
01:10:34,851 --> 01:10:38,450
Villain! We have become useless advice.

694
01:10:41,249 --> 01:10:44,488
Gentlemen, Calm down.

695
01:10:49,166 --> 01:10:52,565
You can of course leave, If you want.

696
01:10:53,924 --> 01:10:58,642
While this was the preliminary session. We will meet again.

697
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:08,079
What has happened to you? Have you hurt yourself?

698
01:11:09,798 --> 01:11:13,716
Where are you've come across? - Mandry organize an obstacle.

699
01:11:14,596 --> 01:11:17,555
I wonder he really hate me.

700
01:11:21,593 --> 01:11:25,951
Do you trust me? You have to. - I can not.

701
01:11:27,071 --> 01:11:32,069
What it is? - Developed plant material.

702
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:37,307
I have not heard of it. - Dr. Kaan does not know everything.

703
01:11:38,947 --> 01:11:41,026
Be a brave boy.

704
01:11:44,585 --> 01:11:47,624
Trust me. Part of the business.

705
01:11:48,903 --> 01:11:51,622
It will not be selling success.

706
01:11:53,741 --> 01:11:59,539
I want to practice medicine. Mandry tentacles do not reach everywhere.

707
01:13:08,192 --> 01:13:10,111
Who caused this?

708
01:13:28,784 --> 01:13:32,742
We bring you the medicine. We will try to get you to the hospital.

709
01:13:44,818 --> 01:13:46,537
Women have been sterilized.

710
01:13:47,817 --> 01:13:51,336
Measures have been clumsily. They have suffered.

711
01:13:56,014 --> 01:13:58,493
Who did it?

712
01:14:00,252 --> 01:14:03,011
Who was it? You have to tell.

713
01:14:06,930 --> 01:14:12,128
It's your boss. We were told, and then we do not know the sick.

714
01:14:23,683 --> 01:14:26,402
Do not miss out victims of measure?

715
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:42,276
Hard to believe such a Mandry.

716
01:14:45,835 --> 01:14:48,794
Women did not know, what happened to them.

717
01:14:59,349 --> 01:15:04,107
"Reproduction of the lower classes is stop. "Do they kill?

718
01:15:05,427 --> 01:15:09,985
"Favourable hereditary features should be favored. "

719
01:15:10,745 --> 01:15:13,784
"By the way rappiollisuus will prevail. "

720
01:15:15,343 --> 01:15:18,542
"The unprofitable spread of genes must be prevented. "

721
01:15:18,822 --> 01:15:24,340
"Little älyiset must be sterilized." American race doctrine in the newspaper.

722
01:15:25,499 --> 01:15:29,457
After all, Mandry was not interested in this.

723
01:15:30,258 --> 01:15:34,776
Only the posh women, flaky and a pair of conservative scholars.

724
01:15:34,936 --> 01:15:37,455
Mandry despise this.

725
01:15:38,654 --> 01:15:42,413
he imagined to settle the population problem?

726
01:15:42,773 --> 01:15:47,411
Does he controlled experiment? He opts lisääntyjät?

727
01:15:48,051 --> 01:15:50,490
Is he already has another group?

728
01:15:50,690 --> 01:15:55,128
Sterilization was probably about to start, Felix presented the study.

729
01:15:55,328 --> 01:15:58,767
Mandry lied to me. He knew what I am.

730
01:15:59,406 --> 01:16:03,285
There is no evidence. He would say ... - That the women gave permission.

731
01:16:04,045 --> 01:16:06,644
That heidänlaisistaan ​​not find out.

732
01:16:08,563 --> 01:16:11,522
This must not continue. Hank's witnesses.

733
01:16:11,842 --> 01:16:17,840
Do you think you got it like that nice? - I may he held accountable.

734
01:16:25,836 --> 01:16:27,835
You can not get in this way.

735
01:16:28,475 --> 01:16:31,834
There are doctors. We can not get past them.

736
01:16:45,948 --> 01:16:48,947
You have been refused entry. For good.

737
01:16:49,747 --> 01:16:52,946
Am I not here either? Here, already celebrated.

738
01:17:03,582 --> 01:17:07,500
I am sorry. - I'm just relieved.

739
01:17:12,658 --> 01:17:16,457
He is certainly the Christmas lecture. You bet.

740
01:17:17,376 --> 01:17:19,495
The lecture is a public occasion.

741
01:17:24,494 --> 01:17:27,773
Machines do the work, which are now being carried out by people.

742
01:17:30,251 --> 01:17:35,809
Machines will put your children sleep, read them a bedtime story.

743
01:17:44,686 --> 01:17:46,845
Good luck. - It is needed.

744
01:17:47,845 --> 01:17:50,764
Scared pretty terribly.

745
01:17:52,203 --> 01:17:53,922
Will this succeed?

746
01:17:55,362 --> 01:17:56,562
Of course.

747
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:05,198
I will speak first. I will help you, If you forget your word. Is not hurry.

748
01:18:06,837 --> 01:18:13,394
How about us lonkerokädet, by stroking machines back to life?

749
01:18:14,754 --> 01:18:21,112
If the machines do all the work, we need more power?

750
01:18:21,751 --> 01:18:28,348
How about us skinny hands, who just twist the pieces on the board?

751
01:18:30,908 --> 01:18:36,426
Toes switch devices on and off.

752
01:18:38,545 --> 01:18:40,104
What about the women?

753
01:18:42,703 --> 01:18:45,862
could women develop in a different direction?

754
01:18:46,502 --> 01:18:50,061
Women Ethan require already in the position himself.

755
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:57,458
Women will develop stronger a gender? Should worry about it?

756
01:18:58,457 --> 01:19:02,815
Will women dominant, certain animal females like?

757
01:19:11,212 --> 01:19:13,651
Seriously, though, pulling together -

758
01:19:14,611 --> 01:19:21,089
should the physical degeneration be worried? That's what's already happening.

759
01:19:22,448 --> 01:19:27,686
It is of incurable diseases, of which suffer from whole sections of the population.

760
01:19:28,446 --> 01:19:31,405
Can not stop development of events?

761
01:19:32,044 --> 01:19:35,483
The lowest social class is unable to provide for themselves, -

762
01:19:35,683 --> 01:19:39,042
but it still increases.

763
01:19:41,841 --> 01:19:47,919
Should an increase in to plan and restrict -

764
01:19:48,798 --> 01:19:52,077
in the name of a new kind of society?

765
01:19:52,517 --> 01:19:53,717
Good!

766
01:19:54,396 --> 01:19:57,675
Weighty issues.

767
01:19:59,034 --> 01:20:05,392
Research institute has developed a solution.

768
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:12,509
Homemade caramel!

769
01:20:18,067 --> 01:20:23,865
In the laboratory hand-made vaniljakinuskia chocolate.

770
01:20:24,464 --> 01:20:26,303
And very delicious.

771
01:20:26,663 --> 01:20:29,462
White Weather now a gift to the public.

772
01:20:46,976 --> 01:20:50,855
Please send it back of the hall. There is a hungry mouths.

773
01:20:53,573 --> 01:20:54,773
You're welcome.

774
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:03,889
A moment went by, courage betrayed.

775
01:21:04,449 --> 01:21:08,008
I looked at him, and I said that I like him.

776
01:21:09,167 --> 01:21:10,886
He was convincing.

777
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:15,085
I also will not be able to. - It's not fair to you.

778
01:21:15,285 --> 01:21:18,684
I do not like it here. - I would not be able to do it.

779
01:21:18,923 --> 01:21:21,522
There you are. When will you return?

780
01:21:22,122 --> 01:21:24,881
When? Paul!

781
01:21:25,601 --> 01:21:29,080
There will be another opportunity, I'm sure. - But when?

782
01:22:09,704 --> 01:22:13,782
Excuse me. I did not know that you're here. - Do not worry, come on in.

783
01:22:16,021 --> 01:22:17,860
Is everything okay?

784
01:22:18,780 --> 01:22:23,578
Everything is just excellent.

785
01:22:25,098 --> 01:22:27,457
As always. - Or at all times.

786
01:22:32,135 --> 01:22:35,054
Hold on! Mrs. White Weather!

787
01:22:35,814 --> 01:22:39,772
This takes only a moment. - I do not have time.

788
01:22:40,132 --> 01:22:43,291
I'm going to the theater. - Do not you remember me?

789
01:22:43,571 --> 01:22:46,250
We drank tea. My clothes were in the dust.

790
01:22:46,609 --> 01:22:49,728
I remember quite well.

791
01:22:55,446 --> 01:22:57,685
You will have 45 seconds.

792
01:22:58,125 --> 01:23:00,964
I do not know whether there was sufficient time.

793
01:23:02,003 --> 01:23:07,841
It is a plant. It is going in the direction of the fault.

794
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:14,318
Ignoring the important work Professor ... - What Works?

795
01:23:15,638 --> 01:23:21,756
I do not have time to explain exactly, but ... - Do you think me stupid?

796
01:23:22,276 --> 01:23:28,234
I do not, I do not. Asia is the only professional. - I've heard of you more than that.

797
01:23:28,633 --> 01:23:31,912
You have the foreign name. Reisenberg.

798
01:23:32,392 --> 01:23:36,390
You do not appear to a foreigner. But you do not know now.

799
01:23:36,950 --> 01:23:41,948
I am not anti-Semitic, even though many of my friends are.

800
01:23:42,588 --> 01:23:47,826
Your husband-funded institution Director Mandry -

801
01:23:48,146 --> 01:23:50,945
sterilize women without their knowledge.

802
01:23:51,304 --> 01:23:54,703
The homeless, the poor, part of the very young.

803
01:23:54,983 --> 01:23:58,062
Lized many, part is dead.

804
01:23:58,862 --> 01:24:02,221
Mandry is a supporter of the racial doctrine.

805
01:24:02,420 --> 01:24:05,619
He wants to choose, who gets to reproduce.

806
01:24:05,779 --> 01:24:08,938
Maybe Mandry considers, that it belongs to his work.

807
01:24:09,098 --> 01:24:12,577
He sterilize people without permission, claiming the treatment.

808
01:24:12,696 --> 01:24:17,454
How do you know? They probably gave permission.

809
01:24:18,014 --> 01:24:23,212
I have witnesses. - They're trying to some money, like everyone else.

810
01:24:24,452 --> 01:24:28,570
Getting tired of this. Elämmehän festive phase.

811
01:24:29,090 --> 01:24:33,848
Did not you know? - People are dead. Directly or indirectly.

812
01:24:34,248 --> 01:24:39,886
Such is the medicine, it improves and it kills.

813
01:24:40,406 --> 01:24:43,605
Your time expired. - You have to listen.

814
01:24:43,884 --> 01:24:48,962
You do not accept it. - You know my opinion?

815
01:24:49,362 --> 01:24:54,000
I begin to understand, why you separated. Goodbye.

816
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:57,159
I prepare for the theater.

817
01:24:58,119 --> 01:25:02,157
He uses monkeys experiments. Professor Mandry.

818
01:25:03,837 --> 01:25:09,155
Monkeys and dogs. advanced animals. Visit even watching.

819
01:25:09,674 --> 01:25:13,992
What did you say? Monkeys and dogs, right?

820
01:25:15,272 --> 01:25:17,031
Is that what you said?

821
01:25:31,106 --> 01:25:33,945
Dr. Russell, when the treatment continues?

822
01:25:51,578 --> 01:25:56,776
The plant was closed down suddenly, without warning.

823
01:25:57,416 --> 01:26:01,734
What will I do without professors?

824
01:26:09,891 --> 01:26:11,210
Close the door.

825
01:26:17,448 --> 01:26:23,446
Please, drink a glass with me. - Of course.

826
01:26:26,485 --> 01:26:32,883
Have I ever behaved prejudiced against you?

827
01:26:33,522 --> 01:26:35,481
Be honest.

828
01:26:35,881 --> 01:26:39,120
You do not. Less than anyone else.

829
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:42,919
So you do not ever. You have always encouraged me.

830
01:26:44,118 --> 01:26:48,836
Good. Well the answer I hoped.

831
01:26:49,836 --> 01:26:57,153
on behalf of my job I need to think about future ways of thinking.

832
01:26:58,952 --> 01:27:05,390
The work is difficult, as only a few are capable of it.

833
01:27:05,790 --> 01:27:08,909
So very few people.

834
01:27:15,986 --> 01:27:19,065
on behalf of the enterprise have to fight.

835
01:27:24,542 --> 01:27:28,261
Neither carry forth the papers. They contain the material through.

836
01:27:31,220 --> 01:27:36,138
This is your fault. - I sorry, but the thing is serious.

837
01:27:36,418 --> 01:27:40,336
You had no evidence. - What a.

838
01:27:41,456 --> 01:27:46,934
Did you want to get revenge Mandry? - Of course not, you know it.

839
01:27:49,093 --> 01:27:53,131
Does your father, what have you done? - I called my sister.

840
01:27:54,251 --> 01:27:58,090
But, Dad, I can not tell you. He will hear in due course.

841
01:28:01,488 --> 01:28:04,047
What a wonderful New Year's Eve.

842
01:28:04,687 --> 01:28:07,806
The new century begins, and we sit here.

843
01:28:08,765 --> 01:28:12,324
I have not been called elsewhere. There was supposed to be a party.

844
01:28:13,803 --> 01:28:19,641
The most important change to one hundred years years, and I have to call.

845
01:28:20,041 --> 01:28:22,920
Come and join the father's party.

846
01:28:25,719 --> 01:28:27,158
Please.

847
01:28:30,837 --> 01:28:32,156
Possibly.

848
01:28:35,475 --> 01:28:37,074
May I come in?

849
01:28:37,794 --> 01:28:39,673
May I come too?

850
01:28:41,473 --> 01:28:43,072
So your father's celebrations.

851
01:28:48,910 --> 01:28:50,150
For.

852
01:28:55,707 --> 01:28:58,066
Did you notice?

853
01:28:59,506 --> 01:29:02,585
You hesitated. It started already.

854
01:29:04,064 --> 01:29:06,143
Clara, do not. - Let go!

855
01:29:08,222 --> 01:29:11,821
Just one day, and it started. Do not touch me!

856
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:20,497
I helped you, but you reject me at the first opportunity!

857
01:29:20,738 --> 01:29:22,577
Dependent nice!

858
01:29:24,856 --> 01:29:28,455
Curious thing Overnight losing addictive.

859
01:29:29,494 --> 01:29:34,452
That asked to get involved in. That thought, therefore, that things can change.

860
01:29:34,772 --> 01:29:37,891
You could not mention love. - I just meant ...

861
01:29:38,011 --> 01:29:42,089
I know what you meant! Do not lie to me.

862
01:29:42,449 --> 01:29:47,367
You do not want to introduce me to your father. - That's not true. According to the source.

863
01:29:47,927 --> 01:29:51,646
Just this evening, you have to be with me. - Is it?

864
01:29:53,045 --> 01:29:54,924
You're hurting me!

865
01:30:03,881 --> 01:30:07,280
You are actually quite similar, you and Mandry.

866
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:08,799
Do not say that.

867
01:30:14,477 --> 01:30:16,476
Where he might that be?

868
01:30:17,716 --> 01:30:22,474
I have to find him. He's still here.

869
01:30:44,025 --> 01:30:47,504
Are you happy now? - Do not you start.

870
01:30:49,263 --> 01:30:54,181
This was an important place for me. More important than you think.

871
01:30:55,421 --> 01:30:57,420
I'm really sorry.

872
01:30:59,539 --> 01:31:01,098
Where is he?

873
01:31:02,378 --> 01:31:08,056
Here are his things. - He went to the New Year celebrations.

874
01:31:09,216 --> 01:31:14,174
He received a number of invitations, but he chose a certain party.

875
01:31:14,614 --> 01:31:19,692
What? - Do you really not know?

876
01:31:25,569 --> 01:31:27,248
Your fathers festivities.

877
01:31:27,729 --> 01:31:33,127
He said the task of putting completed. - Of course.

878
01:31:37,005 --> 01:31:38,644
Oh, my God.

879
01:32:40,580 --> 01:32:42,099
Come on!

880
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:44,939
Who would want to be there now?

881
01:32:45,139 --> 01:32:49,297
Oh father will be with you. This is a moukkamaista.

882
01:32:51,016 --> 01:32:53,015
Moukkamaista horrible.

883
01:33:00,653 --> 01:33:02,052
Can you see him?

884
01:33:02,412 --> 01:33:04,851
There. - What do you have upon you?

885
01:33:05,091 --> 01:33:09,489
We did a sea monster's father. Is not it a great outfit?

886
01:33:09,729 --> 01:33:14,287
I am a blood-sucking mosquito. I can put people all night long.

887
01:33:14,567 --> 01:33:17,646
This is how they will see, that they are indifferent.

888
01:33:17,806 --> 01:33:20,365
This is Clara, which we hope ...

889
01:33:21,165 --> 01:33:23,004
Hopefully, what?

890
01:33:23,404 --> 01:33:26,563
Nice to meet you. I guess you feel cold. Take this. - Thank you.

891
01:33:26,643 --> 01:33:30,082
We met with the rats infested in the basement. Do you remember?

892
01:33:30,281 --> 01:33:31,960
Come take a look.

893
01:33:36,559 --> 01:33:39,358
We need to change out.

894
01:33:39,878 --> 01:33:46,395
Why on earth? - Father shunned, he has not allowed construction.

895
01:33:46,875 --> 01:33:49,194
Why did not she tell me?

896
01:33:49,594 --> 01:33:53,592
Managed to chase. - Not the kind you can do!

897
01:33:54,912 --> 01:34:00,070
That's great. - Too bad, that your affairs went node.

898
01:34:00,790 --> 01:34:03,749
So. I came to see Mandry.

899
01:34:05,148 --> 01:34:06,627
But where is he?

900
01:34:09,306 --> 01:34:10,506
Father.

901
01:34:11,266 --> 01:34:14,305
Outfit is weird. And wonderful.

902
01:34:14,544 --> 01:34:18,183
I did not dare look in the mirror. Maybe I dread not consider this.

903
01:34:18,303 --> 01:34:21,782
The boat was afraid seeing my picture in the water.

904
01:34:22,141 --> 01:34:26,459
Your mother would not have approved such at all.

905
01:34:27,619 --> 01:34:34,456
Either you heard? We have a guest of honor.

906
01:34:37,096 --> 01:34:38,575
I know who.

907
01:34:45,172 --> 01:34:47,451
WELCOME TO THE NEW CENTURY AGAIN

908
01:34:56,008 --> 01:34:57,008
Paul.

909
01:34:57,088 --> 01:35:00,487
You should not have come. Get off the same road.

910
01:35:04,165 --> 01:35:06,524
Do not you have anything else to say?

911
01:35:11,442 --> 01:35:13,601
It is after all, New Year's Eve.

912
01:35:16,041 --> 01:35:20,039
Please submit your conscience by, but progress can not be stopped.

913
01:35:20,199 --> 01:35:21,558
Progress comfortable.

914
01:35:21,638 --> 01:35:25,996
An intelligent person you know that Progress may seem a little hairy.

915
01:35:26,117 --> 01:35:28,276
The approach solves.

916
01:35:28,396 --> 01:35:32,754
Why did you come? - The invitation of the father.

917
01:35:35,073 --> 01:35:37,152
I also wanted to meet you.

918
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:44,030
I wanted to find out Our relationship. I like you.

919
01:35:45,869 --> 01:35:50,427
I also hope that you cancel your claim, -

920
01:35:50,507 --> 01:35:55,105
to be refunded money for research.

921
01:35:56,745 --> 01:36:01,303
I want to explain. - There is no explanation. I know.

922
01:36:01,543 --> 01:36:02,623
Remember it.

923
01:36:02,942 --> 01:36:06,661
Enter now to continue without share.

924
01:36:07,941 --> 01:36:12,019
Consider the matter. The plant is important to me.

925
01:36:14,298 --> 01:36:18,696
Refuse me. Are many of the same opinion.

926
01:36:19,096 --> 01:36:24,334
You tried to make me unwanted external forms, do you remember?

927
01:36:24,814 --> 01:36:30,292
I was angry, because you listened to. Thou wast angry with me.

928
01:36:30,692 --> 01:36:35,170
It is a thing of the past. - We belong here by the same token. Say it out loud.

929
01:36:36,010 --> 01:36:38,569
We belong here. Say!

930
01:36:39,009 --> 01:36:41,288
Of course, you belong to.

931
01:36:43,807 --> 01:36:46,606
But is not New Year's Eve should...

932
01:36:46,766 --> 01:36:51,124
Please get on and get off. I do not ask a second time.

933
01:36:53,523 --> 01:36:55,762
Let's leave it for the moment.

934
01:36:59,201 --> 01:37:05,199
Your father thinks that all is well. Let us not ruin their evening her?

935
01:37:06,318 --> 01:37:11,916
This is important to him. Relish your father's party.

936
01:37:12,796 --> 01:37:15,835
Do not talk to him anymore. Leave us alone.

937
01:37:19,513 --> 01:37:21,232
Get out!

938
01:37:27,110 --> 01:37:28,429
I just...

939
01:37:33,787 --> 01:37:35,666
Goodbye.

940
01:37:42,704 --> 01:37:46,583
Doctor, tell me more future machines.

941
01:37:46,902 --> 01:37:52,620
Shops be built on the moon? - Point I'll tell you, just collect papers.

942
01:37:53,420 --> 01:37:55,059
My Quotations.

943
01:37:55,459 --> 01:37:59,258
Is it you wrote this? - Yes. Those are my thoughts.

944
01:38:52,437 --> 01:38:58,035
Miriam told the bad news. Is it true? - Oh yes.

945
01:38:58,355 --> 01:39:00,634
cause the closure of the plant.

946
01:39:01,354 --> 01:39:06,832
I wanted to be an eminent scholar. Instead I caused the closure of the plant.

947
01:39:07,072 --> 01:39:09,551
That kind of accomplishment.

948
01:39:10,070 --> 01:39:16,827
To think that the Mandry-mannered a good-natured man doing such a thing.

949
01:39:17,947 --> 01:39:21,666
I find it hard to accept your actions.

950
01:39:22,626 --> 01:39:29,383
But I do not want to talk about today. He is here as our guest.

951
01:39:30,702 --> 01:39:32,061
This is Clara.

952
01:39:32,342 --> 01:39:36,860
He is a laboratory assistant. I have lived with him.

953
01:39:40,779 --> 01:39:48,296
Clara, is a New Year's Eve. I might die tomorrow.

954
01:39:49,495 --> 01:39:54,533
And juhlissani rain. What is happening today?

955
01:39:56,652 --> 01:39:58,611
Troublemakers!

956
01:39:59,411 --> 01:40:04,369
They were going to boycott the celebrations, but they went laughing at her.

957
01:40:06,049 --> 01:40:08,408
They are perplexed.

958
01:40:09,767 --> 01:40:13,206
Do not give up. Do not give them a profit.

959
01:40:14,206 --> 01:40:17,005
I, too, I might stay here for a while.

960
01:40:17,244 --> 01:40:20,563
Sick-looking set, at least enough to work.

961
01:40:32,719 --> 01:40:34,878
You're welcome. - God bless you.

962
01:40:38,796 --> 01:40:42,235
We will not forget each other. Hopefully.

963
01:40:54,510 --> 01:40:59,268
Clara, you stay here with me? Decide before midnight.

964
01:41:00,548 --> 01:41:05,786
Our relationship can not succeed. - That's what you can you do not know.

965
01:41:07,225 --> 01:41:09,344
I know. - Etpäs.

966
01:41:09,744 --> 01:41:13,822
Got control of your own life, still you would have the same Clara.

967
01:41:16,782 --> 01:41:18,501
It will not succeed.

968
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:24,698
Say, you do not know for sure. Say before midnight. - I already know.

969
01:41:24,898 --> 01:41:27,937
Etpäs do not know. You have loved me a little.

970
01:41:28,017 --> 01:41:30,576
I should not say it, but I say anyway.

971
01:41:31,016 --> 01:41:35,294
There have been many moments when I have loved you. - Vainko moments?

972
01:41:35,494 --> 01:41:38,493
You are vain! - Say it.

973
01:41:40,652 --> 01:41:46,370
You can not be sure. Say it before midnight.

974
01:41:47,610 --> 01:41:49,609
I will not let you.

975
01:41:52,048 --> 01:41:53,647
Let.

976
01:41:55,207 --> 01:41:59,845
I can not be sure, that our relationship to be successful.

977
01:42:08,761 --> 01:42:11,400
My beloved, it will succeed.

978
01:42:23,316 --> 01:42:27,035
Oh my God. I do not understand why I cry.

979
01:42:27,514 --> 01:42:32,352
All things undone ... One manages to do them?

980
01:42:33,512 --> 01:42:37,630
Will the world be better? What is happening?

981
01:42:38,190 --> 01:42:45,387
Time wonderful dinner party, or what? Wonderful.

982
01:42:47,267 --> 01:42:48,706
Even ones.

983
01:42:49,746 --> 01:42:52,465
Felix, make a prediction.

984
01:42:55,024 --> 01:42:56,983
Soon, we can ...

985
01:42:57,543 --> 01:43:00,182
We can ... we can ...

986
01:43:03,221 --> 01:43:04,780
I can not think.

987
01:43:42,885 --> 01:43:45,964
Happy new century!

988
01:43:54,361 --> 01:44:00,839
Celebrations refreshed father, clearly, because he lived for nearly 20 years.

989
01:44:01,998 --> 01:44:05,757
Felix made later meritorious diabetes research.

990
01:44:06,076 --> 01:44:09,155
I believe that if the annual would have gone differently -

991
01:44:09,395 --> 01:44:11,954
the inventor of insulin would have been Felix.

992
01:44:12,714 --> 01:44:18,272
Often at night and wonder Mandry the dark side of his work.

993
01:44:19,671 --> 01:44:23,070
I did not see him ever again. He left medicine.

994
01:44:23,829 --> 01:44:26,788
I heard that he committed suicide later.

995
01:44:27,628 --> 01:44:30,747
Others tell, that he died peacefully.

996
01:44:31,067 --> 01:44:35,025
He is best in never met the man.

997
01:44:35,625 --> 01:44:39,424
For years I hoped bump into him on the street.

998
01:44:39,703 --> 01:44:43,342
I was hoping to see his visage was sizable.

999
01:44:44,302 --> 01:44:50,020
Clara did not want to marry me, but he became his partner.

1000
01:44:51,139 --> 01:44:54,298
this sanellessani He sits near me.

1001
01:44:54,378 --> 01:44:57,937
We worked for years in a quite countryside.

1002
01:44:58,216 --> 01:45:00,535
We have fought a lot of course.

1003
01:45:00,975 --> 01:45:03,134
That was only to be expected.

1004
01:45:04,694 --> 01:45:09,332
Nothing in my life though, has 
ever quite - the strange feeling I had that night 

1005
01:45:10,371 --> 01:45:13,690
excited, and worried, and hopeful

1006
01:45:14,250 --> 01:45:18,288
as we moved together into a new century.

1007
01:45:19,305 --> 01:45:25,922
