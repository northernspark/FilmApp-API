There's a robbery in progress at the Bank 914.

00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:50,717
Unit 571 responds immediately.

8
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,844
Received.

00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,683
Get me Captain, please.

00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,060
<I> - Captain Howard.
- Captain ... </ i>

11
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,104
We have a problem. Come soon.

12
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:22,207
Very good. Listen, guys.

13
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:27,796
There is an armed robbery in progress.

14
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,756
In the Coastal Bank
Savings and Loan.

15
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:32,176
You know the procedure.

16
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,219
We do not want llaneros
lonely, Williams.

17
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:37,139
Now, who are you?

18
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:38,932
Prepared and committed!

19
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:42,102
That's! Let's finish with some villains!

20
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,863
How about you, dear?

21
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,159
You know I could make a place.

22
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:00,412
Why do not you come here?

23
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,458
What if I put my foot in your ass?

24
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,878
- I do not know how you dare.
- Show him respect!

25
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,256
It will teach you to respect.

26
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,218
Katana. It's enough.

27
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,809
Yes sir.

28
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,485
It is fiery.

29
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:34,821
What if we raise the bet?

30
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,198
What do you propose?

31
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,785
Fifteen?

32
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:41,954
Twenty?

33
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:44,790
I sold.

34
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,088
For the man who
It has everything to lose.

35
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:00,222
Really?

36
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:03,851
Like hell.

37
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:07,187
You're a good negotiator.

38
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:11,275
Take the time you want.
I have nowhere to go.

39
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:24,830
When you sign this, it will be
binding. You can not undo.

40
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,461
Absolutely.

41
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,518
Well, Bones, look at this.

42
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,112
The vault is open.

43
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,364
There are records there.

44
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,074
I'll go look for them.

45
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,869
It was not part of the plan.
We have no time.

46
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,121
It is now part of the plan.

47
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,165
- What the hell are you thinking?
- Shut.

48
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:12,878
Office, there are at least three assailants.

49
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,087
Yes, send reinforcements.

50
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,340
Who do you think you're talking?

51
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,509
I talk with you. What do you have to say?

52
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,053
Calm down! There is not
time for this shit.

53
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:22,304
Shut up!

54
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,473
Bank 914. Yes, 914.

55
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,558
Are you serious?

56
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,519
Talk to him. This is not a game.

57
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,104
We have to get out of here!
Have you gone crazy?

58
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:36,109
No, I'm not crazy.
I want to get that money.

59
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:40,489
Drop your weapons! Right now! Now!

60
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:47,329
Fuck. Damn cops.

61
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:50,499
This place is full of cops.
You better not fuck.

62
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,293
I hate cops.

63
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,937
- Smith. Inside.
- Yes sir.

64
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:16,400
Williams, inside. Johnson ...

65
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:21,613
Watch the alley. Get on the roof.

66
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,198
<I> Listen, man. </ I>

67
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,577
<I> Nobody move a muscle
until I give the order. </ i>

68
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:30,706
Get me the Bank.

69
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:33,417
They want to see these damn.

70
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,294
Yes sir.

71
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,673
We need a direct line
the Bank as soon as possible.

72
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,969
<I> Understood. In position.
I am awaiting orders. </ I>

73
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,283
I see.

74
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:10,537
Someone let me know
that damn bank!

75
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:40,692
Below. Below.

76
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:12,641
<I> CHECKMATE </ i>

77
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,380
<I> A DAY BEFORE </ i>

78
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:40,646
<I> This is the Gospel of the Lord </ i>

79
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:57,579
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

80
00:08:57,621 --> 00:09:00,415
How long it was
since your last confession?

81
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:06,213
Do you have something for me, my son?

82
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:09,299
Yes, Father.

83
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,646
And you sin?

84
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:41,373
Are you sure about this?

85
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,295
Some things can not be undone.

86
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,217
I did not want this.

87
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,513
It is my last resort.

88
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:01,476
I did not work in two years. I lost everything.

89
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:07,691
My house was repossessed, I have no car.

90
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,611
And my son ...

91
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:13,906
You can not look like a suicide.

92
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,786
That's all I care about.
You can not look like a suicide.

93
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:23,290
Once done, my family
you can collect the insurance.

94
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:29,338
All that matters to me
They are receiving the money.

95
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:31,590
So please...

96
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,430
Jeremiah 6:13.

97
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:42,976
<I> "For from the least to the
greatest, all are greedy for gain, </ i>

98
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:48,315
<I> and from the prophet even unto the
priest, all practice deceit. "</ i>

99
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:53,403
Twice this.

100
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,823
It's okay. I'll get the money.

101
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,997
That's all, my son.

102
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,333
Wait.

103
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,462
You can not look like a suicide.

104
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:13,799
That's what matters to me.

105
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:41,326
I'm sick of this
damn engine, man.

106
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,120
Fuck!

107
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,581
Do not do that.

108
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:47,875
Are ago how much work on this, Bones?

109
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,459
Too much time.

110
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,712
¿Alineaste start and alternator?

111
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,589
What the fuck are these wires?

112
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:59,720
Hey, motherfucker, I'm doing
this since before you were born.

113
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:03,390
I know what I do. Shut up.

114
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:06,518
It's okay. Just do what I say.

115
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,104
I should leave it locked.

116
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:13,817
Tiny, you're killing me!

117
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:15,944
It's bean burrito.

118
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,654
Dammit!

119
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,948
Stick to clothes, right?

120
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,117
That stinks like shit.

121
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:24,776
Do not blame me for me,
but the guy who wrapped.

122
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,498
Damn man!

123
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:29,541
Get out out then.

124
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,753
If you need me, I'll be smoking.

125
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,591
These American cars
They are crap.

126
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,930
Bones, is right about the start.

127
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,598
You are wrong.

128
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:45,807
Get out.

129
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:54,566
Dammit!

130
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,535
What happens to you? Thought
it was the police, right?

131
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,495
You're a damn fool, Joey.

132
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,831
Quiet, yet I
You want, motherfucker.

133
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:10,082
That beauty.

134
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:13,961
Infiniti. How are you?

135
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:16,463
Too bad we have to
cut into pieces. Tuck.

136
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:18,674
Does it have to be now?

137
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,009
Let's enjoy
this beast for a while.

138
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:23,804
Hop on, let's warm.

139
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:27,558
Very good. I am recharged.

140
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:31,895
Yes, motherfucker!

141
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:39,570
Hey, brother. We stop here, okay?

142
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:41,572
There will be two seconds. Do not worry.

143
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:44,616
- It's okay.
- Great.

144
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:55,460
Father.

145
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:59,548
What if you change your mind?

146
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:03,218
He is no longer in their hands.

147
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:22,905
Hello. Do not worry, I'll pay.

148
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:38,003
Dude, you got truffle butter?

149
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,213
Yes, it's there ...

150
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:41,798
Have truffle butter?
Give me the money!

151
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:43,675
- Give me the damn money!
- Do not do this.

152
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,636
- Shut up and give me the money!
- Do not do this.

153
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:49,223
- Give it to me or I'll blow your brains out!
- You mess with the wrong guy.

154
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:51,808
You say I put me
with the wrong guy?

155
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:55,229
Really? I do not know why
You say, because I have the gun.

156
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:56,813
<I> What the hell does? </ I>

157
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:02,986
- Give me the damn money, now!
- No problem.

158
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:05,072
I'll blow your brains together
with this damn place.

159
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:09,493
Give it to me now. Now!

160
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:11,995
- Okay, here it is.
- Thank you.

161
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:14,248
Fuck me!

162
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:18,252
Enters!

163
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:20,337
Come on, come on, motherfucker!
We're rich!

164
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:27,052
Motherfucker!
Do not ever steal this store!

165
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:49,908
Here you go. Anything else? They are fine?

166
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:14,141
Can I get you anything else?

167
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:16,078
- What I give?
- A Deadman.

168
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,871
All right.

169
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:20,666
Hey, what are you going to drink?

170
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,841
Do not worry, you're not my type.

171
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:31,009
Fuck!

172
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:39,101
Can you believe this guy?
He believes that interests me.

173
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:42,062
Ridiculous, those girls kissing.

174
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:48,986
Yes. I love this city.

175
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:39,453
What the hell do you want?

176
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:42,915
It is an interesting phrase.

177
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:47,377
You remember, right?

178
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:00,140
Keep it.

179
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:05,854
Dammit!

180
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:11,985
Corinthians said to know
truth is a revelation.

181
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:15,239
When I was a kid,
I spake as a child,

182
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:20,035
I thought like a child,
I reasoned like a child.

183
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:24,915
But when I grew up, I left
such childish ways!

184
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:32,214
We see only a reflection,
as in a mirror.

185
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:39,096
But what remains are these
three things: hope, faith and love.

186
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:46,436
The greatest is love.

187
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:56,446
But the cruel bring
ruin upon themselves.

188
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,960
Is everybody okay back there?

189
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:12,171
Everything will be fine. Keep
the wheels on the road ...

190
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:13,547
and Take us there in one piece.

191
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:15,924
Hold on, baby, hold on.

192
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:18,594
Quiet. Everything will be fine.
We are on our way.

193
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:21,513
Does your wife have a history
breathing problems?

194
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:25,475
Your inhaler is in your bag.
We have to find it.

195
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,353
Here it is, baby. Hold on. Here you go.

196
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:35,027
You are better?

197
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:38,322
- It's better?
- It's happening again.

198
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:42,534
Quiet, everything will be okay.
Keep calm.

199
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:44,328
How is my baby?

200
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:49,625
Lady will arrive in two minutes.
Everything will be OK.

201
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:53,420
I love you so much baby.

202
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:56,632
Just hold on a little longer.
Within two minutes.

203
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,351
Hello Friend.

204
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:54,314
potato, I have fear. When
I can go home?

205
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:57,526
You will return home soon.

206
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:04,449
Do not panic. There's nothing to be scared.

207
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:07,077
You will return home soon.

208
00:22:19,131 --> 00:22:21,425
It is difficult to understand this.

209
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:26,680
You'll understand in a while.

210
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:30,434
You will see.

211
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,062
You just have to know something.

212
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:36,690
Your dad loves you with all his heart.

213
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:45,491
You must remember that.

214
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,410
I love you Papa.

215
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:29,034
Love you.

216
00:23:51,557 --> 00:23:54,142
- The fucked, Joey.
- It Does that seem fucked?

217
00:23:55,143 --> 00:24:00,274
There are ten thousand here. Let's go.
We will leave. Let's go.

218
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:04,695
- Ten thousand!
- What the hell are you?

219
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:08,490
Ten thousand! Ten thousand! Ten thousand!

220
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:09,616
What the hell is wrong with you?

221
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:12,411
What do you mean? Look at this, asshole.

222
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:14,079
They are ten thousand!

223
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:18,375
- Its a lot of money.
- A lot of money.

224
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:21,378
But you know something? Not much money.

225
00:24:24,423 --> 00:24:27,884
What I say is that if you think
crawl in some shit,

226
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,346
I wish you'd anticiparas.
That's all I ask.

227
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:34,474
You're a fucking fagot.

228
00:24:34,725 --> 00:24:39,313
Ten thousand. This is nothing. Is nothing.

229
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:43,775
Fuck that shit.
It was only a test.

230
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,821
You know what, brother? You failed.

231
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:51,450
- I missed?
- Shut up, shut up!

232
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:55,287
Look, Ron. Tomorrow is the big day.

233
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:58,207
If you happen to do this
tomorrow, we're screwed.

234
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:02,461
Tomorrow is our Super Bowl.

235
00:25:03,128 --> 00:25:04,630
<I> Tomorrow is when we win. </ I>

236
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:08,509
So gets your fucking
head in the damn game.

237
00:25:09,635 --> 00:25:10,719
Do you understand?

238
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:13,263
Throw me the ball, catch it and write it down.

239
00:25:13,305 --> 00:25:15,766
We always did and I will continue doing.

240
00:25:16,225 --> 00:25:20,687
Okay. Fuck me, Ron. Fuck me.

241
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:26,652
Motherfucker.

242
00:25:57,266 --> 00:25:59,268
Hello Doctor.

243
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:05,190
How is it going?

244
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:09,403
Equal. We are doing
everything for him.

245
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,369
Are you sure you do not
There's nothing I can do ...?

246
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:20,247
To upload the list
donor? Are you sure?

247
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:22,416
You can not do anything.

248
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:26,461
If it were me, Christopher
would be high on the list.

249
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:30,465
Unfortunately we have policies
in the hospital to follow.

250
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:35,345
I know. I get it.

251
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:39,224
All you can do is
see to continue with medication,

252
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:44,229
you are comfortable and you,
try to rest.

253
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:46,857
We are
doing everything possible.

254
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:50,360
Well, thank you, doctor.

255
00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:51,528
Very good.

256
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:07,794
Everything will be OK.
This time it will be all right.

257
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:11,798
You'll have this baby.

258
00:27:21,225 --> 00:27:25,437
My love, you have to endure.

259
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,664
Above!

260
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:49,378
- Hello.
- Come here, honey.

261
00:27:51,255 --> 00:27:52,714
Hello little one.

262
00:27:54,967 --> 00:27:56,718
I felt him kick.

263
00:27:57,928 --> 00:28:03,058
I do not know if it will be a boy or a girl,
but sure you play football.

264
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:07,521
How do I look?

265
00:28:07,563 --> 00:28:10,607
You always look amazing.
Even with your 135 kilos.

266
00:28:12,985 --> 00:28:14,653
I'll see you in the kitchen.

267
00:28:21,577 --> 00:28:22,953
Hi dear.

268
00:28:32,421 --> 00:28:35,007
- Hi dear.
- Hey, baby.

269
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:36,758
I did not hear you come in.

270
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:40,012
I have just arrived.

271
00:28:40,554 --> 00:28:45,100
<I> I made lasagna last night. </ I>

272
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:50,814
If you're hungry, heat it.
It's in the fridge.

273
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:53,984
The left side.

274
00:28:55,861 --> 00:28:59,615
I tried a new sauce.

275
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:06,038
I do not know. You might also like.

276
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,874
It has much garlic.

277
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:15,506
I cleaned the room of Christopher ...

278
00:29:17,758 --> 00:29:22,930
and I was thinking.
I think you need a new bed.

279
00:29:24,556 --> 00:29:26,725
He grew up a lot.

280
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:29,645
Maybe we could go to the store,

281
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,480
buy paint and paint your room.

282
00:29:31,522 --> 00:29:33,106
I do not like that color.

283
00:29:34,608 --> 00:29:36,109
And new sheets.

284
00:29:37,361 --> 00:29:40,405
Maybe the NFL with
equipment designs.

285
00:29:44,952 --> 00:29:47,621
Christopher was awake last night.

286
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:04,096
I think I'll buy
shirt you like.

287
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:07,140
That blue highlighting her eyes.

288
00:30:09,977 --> 00:30:11,562
He liked.

289
00:30:12,604 --> 00:30:13,939
Yes.

290
00:30:23,532 --> 00:30:24,700
Okay...

291
00:30:30,164 --> 00:30:32,457
- Rest.
- It's okay.

292
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:35,085
Affection...

293
00:30:36,587 --> 00:30:37,963
I love you.

294
00:30:41,091 --> 00:30:42,718
And I you.

295
00:30:53,854 --> 00:30:54,938
Fuck.

296
00:31:31,183 --> 00:31:32,518
Affection?

297
00:31:34,686 --> 00:31:35,979
What happened?

298
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:39,733
I'm so fat, that neither
I can make breakfast.

299
00:31:39,775 --> 00:31:41,944
You're not fat!

300
00:31:41,985 --> 00:31:45,155
You should not make breakfast.
The doctor said I must rest.

301
00:31:45,197 --> 00:31:46,240
I know.

302
00:31:46,532 --> 00:31:48,158
- Then what do you do?
- Only me...

303
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,244
Stay there. I am going to
clean this up, okay?

304
00:31:50,285 --> 00:31:54,790
I just wanted to make breakfast,
that is all. I'm useless.

305
00:31:54,832 --> 00:31:57,626
- You're not useless.
- I'm a fat cow and useless.

306
00:31:57,668 --> 00:31:59,837
I'll breakfast. You're useless.

307
00:32:04,174 --> 00:32:08,929
I already lost two. I can not lose this.

308
00:32:08,971 --> 00:32:11,223
We are together, yes?

309
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:15,018
Avoid standing.
Trust me? Can you do it?

310
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,563
- Yes.
- Very good.

311
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:20,899
I love you. I must go to work.
You will be fine?

312
00:32:20,941 --> 00:32:23,151
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

313
00:32:31,618 --> 00:32:33,787
Stay here. Do not do anything.

314
00:32:33,829 --> 00:32:35,330
It's okay.

315
00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:40,711
Very good. I love you.

316
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:42,337
I love you too.

317
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:01,607
Lord, the estimated time
is two minutes.

318
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:03,692
<I> Thank you, honey. </ I>

319
00:33:06,028 --> 00:33:10,699
<I> Well, I'm here,
desahogándome you. </ i>

320
00:33:10,741 --> 00:33:13,702
<I> What you want to talk?
Did what happened before with Rafe? </ I>

321
00:33:18,957 --> 00:33:20,000
Hello?

322
00:33:20,042 --> 00:33:21,919
<I> Good morning, speaks Ms. Campbell? </ I>

323
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,003
Yes.

324
00:33:23,045 --> 00:33:26,340
<I> I'm Kathy Ford
Savings and Loan Bank. </ I>

325
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:30,177
<I> I'm calling your mortgage payment.
We do not receive and has expired. </ i>

326
00:33:30,219 --> 00:33:32,304
Well, I'm sure
which we did get.

327
00:33:32,346 --> 00:33:34,348
Can you wait a moment?

328
00:33:34,598 --> 00:33:35,849
<I> Sure. </ I>

329
00:33:50,906 --> 00:33:53,826
Sorry, I must have passed us.

330
00:33:53,867 --> 00:33:55,828
<I> Can we pay tomorrow? </ I>

331
00:33:55,911 --> 00:33:57,871
<I> In order to avoid
a fine for late payment, </ i>

332
00:33:57,913 --> 00:34:00,332
<I> need to receive this payment today. </ I>

333
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:03,252
I understand. We will ship in the afternoon.

334
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:04,920
<I> I'm sorry I bothered you. </ I>

335
00:34:04,962 --> 00:34:07,339
<I> Thank you, Ms. Campbell,
Have a nice day. </ i>

336
00:34:15,264 --> 00:34:17,057
Lauren calling ...

337
00:34:23,313 --> 00:34:27,192
Hello, Paul. I know you're
busy, but called the Bank.

338
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:32,948
We have to pay the mortgage.
I go to the bank and take care of it.

339
00:34:33,824 --> 00:34:36,034
<I> I promise that after
So I rest, okay? </ i>

340
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:38,245
<I> I love you. </ I>

341
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,123
Lands there.

342
00:34:43,876 --> 00:34:45,794
Lord, the estimated time
is two minutes.

343
00:35:22,498 --> 00:35:26,210
- Do you have the schedule to this location?
- Yes, if something changes, I'll let you know.

344
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,878
I understood.

345
00:36:11,004 --> 00:36:12,297
We're coming, sir.

346
00:36:13,173 --> 00:36:14,883
<I> Thank you, honey. </ I>

347
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:25,394
What the hell are you doing? Are you ready?

348
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:27,271
Let's do it.

349
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:41,243
Come on, brother.

350
00:36:41,368 --> 00:36:45,581
Listen, Mom is gone. Do you understand?

351
00:36:47,082 --> 00:36:49,543
What are you doing here reminiscing
about this shit?

352
00:36:49,585 --> 00:36:52,087
This is a great job.
Great job.

353
00:36:52,337 --> 00:36:55,257
This is the shit we
He will kill. Do you understand?

354
00:36:56,049 --> 00:36:58,218
Concentrate on the game.

355
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,552
Fuck!

356
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:44,598
<I> Come on, fagot. </ I>

357
00:38:59,173 --> 00:39:00,215
Give me one click.

358
00:39:03,635 --> 00:39:05,095
Now.

359
00:39:05,554 --> 00:39:07,222
- It's okay?
- It's okay.

360
00:39:34,082 --> 00:39:35,250
Father.

361
00:39:42,007 --> 00:39:44,301
Father, we must re-
think about this. It is not worth it.

362
00:39:45,469 --> 00:39:47,513
I descended from heaven, not
to do my will,

363
00:39:47,596 --> 00:39:49,640
but the will of him that sent me.

364
00:39:51,558 --> 00:39:53,435
John 6:38.

365
00:40:34,434 --> 00:40:37,312
<I> RETIREMENT </ i>

366
00:41:17,477 --> 00:41:19,688
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

367
00:41:22,858 --> 00:41:26,236
Mr. Thompson, I'm sorry
the wait. Come with me.

368
00:41:39,374 --> 00:41:40,709
I hate to get paid by the hour.

369
00:41:42,753 --> 00:41:45,130
- Are you okay?
- If I am fine.

370
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,174
- Can you hold the fort?
- Yes.

371
00:41:47,257 --> 00:41:49,301
- Insurance?
- Yes.

372
00:41:49,384 --> 00:41:51,553
- Like last time?
- Not better.

373
00:41:51,595 --> 00:41:52,638
Very good.

374
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:55,265
- Is it time for a ten to one?
- No, no.

375
00:41:55,807 --> 00:41:58,560
Ten-dos. I'll be right back.

376
00:44:22,955 --> 00:44:25,582
- Any problem?
- I'm not sure about that.

377
00:44:25,666 --> 00:44:29,044
We're fine, brother.
Breathe. Calm down.

378
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:33,924
Look, I do not know what the
problem, but do not ruin this.

379
00:44:37,678 --> 00:44:39,847
- Be sure to climb to the roof.
- Yes sir.

380
00:44:42,558 --> 00:44:44,351
- Wait for my notice.
- Yes, I understand.

381
00:44:44,893 --> 00:44:46,353
Ready?

382
00:46:15,818 --> 00:46:18,570
All right, everybody. This is an assault.

383
00:46:18,612 --> 00:46:20,823
Everybody down, now!

384
00:46:21,573 --> 00:46:23,826
On the ground, now! Get down!

385
00:46:24,451 --> 00:46:26,537
Down! Down!

386
00:46:26,578 --> 00:46:27,746
I'll blow your head off!

387
00:46:27,788 --> 00:46:29,748
Everybody down! Get down!

388
00:46:38,465 --> 00:46:43,679
Get on the ground! I said that...!

389
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:47,850
Motherfucker, Drop
ground or I'll blow your head.

390
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:50,018
You son of a bitch!

391
00:46:51,728 --> 00:46:52,938
- Get down!
- Hands up!

392
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,482
Anyone else want
be a goddamn hero?

393
00:46:55,524 --> 00:46:57,985
Do not do it. Heroes die.

394
00:47:04,116 --> 00:47:07,452
Arise! Hands up!

395
00:47:08,787 --> 00:47:11,874
Than? What happens to you? What happens to you?

396
00:47:15,169 --> 00:47:17,671
Shut up, you stupid fagot!

397
00:47:21,633 --> 00:47:24,469
Want to be a hero? Are you a hero?

398
00:47:25,512 --> 00:47:28,891
- What are you waiting for?
- I expect nothing.

399
00:47:30,225 --> 00:47:31,768
Shut up, fagot!

400
00:47:34,229 --> 00:47:36,231
Fill it! No marked bills!

401
00:47:37,065 --> 00:47:38,984
I'll blow your brains out!

402
00:47:39,026 --> 00:47:41,862
Hurry up! Move!

403
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:53,916
Office.

404
00:47:53,999 --> 00:47:56,251
Move, move!

405
00:47:57,628 --> 00:47:58,754
Faster!

406
00:47:59,713 --> 00:48:03,050
You're the first asshole I kill you.
I want you to know. I promise you.

407
00:48:03,133 --> 00:48:05,135
Arise! Now!

408
00:48:05,761 --> 00:48:10,265
We have a robbery in progress.
Shots were fired. It is the Bank 914.

409
00:48:11,808 --> 00:48:12,851
Unchecked!

410
00:48:13,852 --> 00:48:15,979
What the fuck ...?
What is happening to you now?

411
00:48:16,021 --> 00:48:18,690
Fuck! Do not look at me!

412
00:48:18,774 --> 00:48:20,108
Heads down!

413
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:24,530
Shut! Come here.

414
00:48:58,230 --> 00:48:59,606
<I> I'm going down. </ I>

415
00:49:00,149 --> 00:49:01,900
The units are coming.

416
00:49:02,025 --> 00:49:03,235
I understood.

417
00:49:06,697 --> 00:49:08,240
Get me Captain, please.

418
00:49:09,783 --> 00:49:11,034
<I> - Captain Howard.
- Captain ... </ i>

419
00:49:11,076 --> 00:49:13,120
We have a problem. Come soon.

420
00:49:14,955 --> 00:49:17,583
Be alert. Get ready.

421
00:49:17,666 --> 00:49:19,209
Remember, this is not an assault.

422
00:49:19,251 --> 00:49:21,587
It's a rescue mission. There hostages.

423
00:49:21,628 --> 00:49:23,797
This is EE. UU. We are
here to save people.

424
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:27,050
We do not want heroes.
All go home tonight.

425
00:49:27,092 --> 00:49:28,260
Who the fuck are?

426
00:49:28,302 --> 00:49:30,637
- Prepared and committed!
- That's!

427
00:49:34,766 --> 00:49:36,643
For the man who
It has everything to lose.

428
00:49:42,608 --> 00:49:46,695
<I> ACT TO ETERNITY </ i>

429
00:49:49,656 --> 00:49:50,991
Are you sure about this?

430
00:49:52,284 --> 00:49:53,869
Like hell.

431
00:49:58,707 --> 00:50:02,669
Take your time
you want. I have nowhere to go.

432
00:50:03,962 --> 00:50:09,218
When you sign this, it will be
binding. You can not undo.

433
00:50:09,259 --> 00:50:10,886
I think exactly the same.

434
00:50:15,933 --> 00:50:18,977
Eternity or nothing.

435
00:50:21,939 --> 00:50:23,816
Absolutely.

436
00:50:28,654 --> 00:50:30,030
What happens to you? Are you okay?

437
00:50:30,364 --> 00:50:32,074
Dammit. It is Lauren.

438
00:50:32,991 --> 00:50:34,284
Is the baby okay?

439
00:50:34,326 --> 00:50:35,869
She's in the bank.

440
00:50:47,631 --> 00:50:50,884
914. Yes Bank, Bank 914.

441
00:50:50,968 --> 00:50:53,846
- Are you serious?
- Talk to him. This is not a joke.

442
00:50:53,887 --> 00:50:56,390
We have to get out of here!
Have you gone crazy?

443
00:50:56,431 --> 00:51:00,978
No, I'm not crazy.
I want to get that money.

444
00:51:01,687 --> 00:51:04,022
Drop your weapons! Now!

445
00:51:04,064 --> 00:51:07,192
Come on! Now!

446
00:51:07,693 --> 00:51:10,237
Comuníquenme with the Bank!

447
00:51:25,294 --> 00:51:29,131
Drop your weapons, now. Tírenlas!

448
00:51:29,173 --> 00:51:30,716
Where should we throw them?

449
00:51:31,008 --> 00:51:34,052
Down, come on, boy. Now!

450
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,513
Down.

451
00:51:36,722 --> 00:51:38,432
- Take off the masks.
- Quiet.

452
00:51:38,515 --> 00:51:39,892
Take off the masks.

453
00:51:42,853 --> 00:51:44,062
Come on!

454
00:51:45,147 --> 00:51:46,815
Ready!

455
00:51:46,857 --> 00:51:48,066
- Yes.
- I got them...

456
00:51:48,108 --> 00:51:50,110
Would you have us? For real?

457
00:51:50,235 --> 00:51:52,488
Is incredible. We caught.

458
00:51:54,948 --> 00:51:56,283
You dont have anything.

459
00:51:56,325 --> 00:51:58,911
I do not think so. Give me your gun.

460
00:52:00,454 --> 00:52:01,747
Get down!

461
00:52:06,084 --> 00:52:10,881
Look who we have here. Look!

462
00:52:10,923 --> 00:52:13,467
- What a beautiful piece of work.
- Thanks sweetie.

463
00:52:13,759 --> 00:52:15,969
What the hell are we doing here?

464
00:52:16,011 --> 00:52:19,932
<I> - Shut up!
- Thank you </ i>.

465
00:52:20,015 --> 00:52:22,059
- Are you going to check the rest?
- Dammit!

466
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,478
I can not believe it!
We gotta get out of here!

467
00:52:25,979 --> 00:52:27,105
Give me my gun.

468
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:29,358
You have to calm down a little.

469
00:52:29,942 --> 00:52:32,277
Shut up and relax.

470
00:52:33,487 --> 00:52:35,072
Do not look at me like that.

471
00:52:36,448 --> 00:52:38,951
- This is stupid.
- Shut.

472
00:52:47,292 --> 00:52:49,378
I do not have time for this!
Let's get out of here!

473
00:52:49,461 --> 00:52:52,506
- Calm down.
- What calms me?

474
00:52:52,548 --> 00:52:55,050
- Are you serious?
- It's okay.

475
00:52:55,968 --> 00:52:59,012
Police is coming. They must go.

476
00:52:59,054 --> 00:53:02,224
He left. Take the money.

477
00:53:02,266 --> 00:53:04,226
- Take the money and go.
- Shut up!

478
00:53:10,858 --> 00:53:15,571
Okay okay.
Easy, easy.

479
00:53:18,157 --> 00:53:19,908
Stay quiet.

480
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,952
- Mom?
- Yes.

481
00:53:21,994 --> 00:53:25,414
All in order. Okay back there.

482
00:53:25,831 --> 00:53:26,957
What shall we do, dammit?

483
00:53:26,999 --> 00:53:29,251
I'll get the money back.

484
00:53:29,334 --> 00:53:32,171
Shut up. And control yourself.

485
00:53:32,212 --> 00:53:35,215
I do not want to go to jail! Fuck!

486
00:53:37,092 --> 00:53:39,136
Is it worth it, Joey?

487
00:53:39,178 --> 00:53:41,013
I'll get the tiles!

488
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:45,642
The only thing you can do is complain.

489
00:53:45,684 --> 00:53:49,354
Your brother just try to take care of.

490
00:53:49,396 --> 00:53:51,148
We're screwed!

491
00:53:51,982 --> 00:53:53,901
You're a jerk.

492
00:54:12,336 --> 00:54:15,380
Well well.

493
00:54:15,422 --> 00:54:18,383
You move.

494
00:55:05,722 --> 00:55:07,140
As you can see, Mr. Thompson,

495
00:55:07,182 --> 00:55:09,685
your money is very safe here
in the Savings and Loan Bank.

496
00:55:09,726 --> 00:55:11,228
Certainly, you should consider ...

497
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:14,620
I do not even think.
I'll shoot you.

498
00:55:14,648 --> 00:55:16,358
Nobody, motherfucker move.

499
00:55:19,027 --> 00:55:20,279
Dammit.

500
00:55:21,029 --> 00:55:22,948
High! Fuck!

501
00:55:26,493 --> 00:55:29,371
Stupid, why did you?
I do not get it.

502
00:55:29,413 --> 00:55:30,956
Why the hell did you do that?

503
00:55:31,623 --> 00:55:33,375
Dammit! Fuck!

504
00:55:33,458 --> 00:55:35,627
Move it! Now! Above!

505
00:55:36,628 --> 00:55:38,172
Fuck!

506
00:55:59,067 --> 00:56:02,321
Everybody down! Heavens!

507
00:56:02,696 --> 00:56:04,156
Get down!

508
00:56:05,032 --> 00:56:06,533
Hurry up!

509
00:56:06,575 --> 00:56:08,035
Get down!

510
00:56:08,076 --> 00:56:10,662
What is this? Where did these people?

511
00:56:11,997 --> 00:56:13,457
Let me talk to you for a second.

512
00:56:13,499 --> 00:56:18,128
Unfortunately, when I went
in the vault there was a guard.

513
00:56:18,212 --> 00:56:21,507
And it will not bother us anymore.

514
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:22,716
What do you mean?

515
00:56:26,512 --> 00:56:29,056
What the fuck you mean
that's not going to bother?

516
00:56:29,097 --> 00:56:32,267
Hey, brother, if
you want to talk, come here.

517
00:56:32,309 --> 00:56:33,727
- What's going on, Joey?
- Come here.

518
00:56:33,769 --> 00:56:37,105
Come here. Everything will be OK.

519
00:56:37,481 --> 00:56:40,067
Come here.

520
00:56:41,777 --> 00:56:43,237
What is it, Joey?

521
00:56:43,278 --> 00:56:45,614
Listen, listen. Everything is fine.

522
00:56:45,656 --> 00:56:48,158
Do you understand? All good.

523
00:56:52,371 --> 00:56:53,413
This is fine.

524
00:56:53,455 --> 00:56:54,623
- Is this okay?
- Yes.

525
00:56:54,665 --> 00:56:56,667
- What the hell?
- You know it.

526
00:56:56,708 --> 00:56:57,709
Are you okay?

527
00:57:03,715 --> 00:57:05,175
Try to endure.

528
00:57:06,176 --> 00:57:09,096
What do you mean? I want
we paid, motherfucker.

529
00:57:09,763 --> 00:57:12,558
Does this was your plan?

530
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:14,560
Who is screwing everything now, Joey?

531
00:57:16,395 --> 00:57:19,439
Do not ever say that.
Do not ever tell.

532
00:57:19,481 --> 00:57:22,067
- We were going to come and go.
- Listen, I love you.

533
00:57:22,151 --> 00:57:24,736
And sometimes life changes, right?

534
00:57:24,778 --> 00:57:27,072
People have to
adapt. This is life.

535
00:57:27,114 --> 00:57:28,782
The typical Joey.

536
00:57:31,285 --> 00:57:33,245
You always do things by halves.

537
00:57:35,455 --> 00:57:40,294
The typical Ron, always
you act like a fag.

538
00:57:40,335 --> 00:57:41,503
You know what?

539
00:57:42,838 --> 00:57:44,506
Fuck you, Ron.

540
00:57:45,507 --> 00:57:49,344
And to hell with the black. According?

541
00:57:49,595 --> 00:57:53,140
If you're saying
You believe in this nonsense ...

542
00:57:53,223 --> 00:57:56,268
I'm the one you
protects. He who loves you.

543
00:57:56,393 --> 00:57:58,395
Whoever wants our
life better. I!

544
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:02,190
Fuck that guy!
Fuck the black!

545
00:58:02,316 --> 00:58:03,817
I'll kill you right here.

546
00:58:03,859 --> 00:58:06,320
I'm here to get money.

547
00:58:06,361 --> 00:58:09,406
I'm going to that dome
and I will do it for us.

548
00:58:09,448 --> 00:58:12,784
If you prefer, leave.
Go with black.

549
00:58:29,718 --> 00:58:32,804
You look somewhat rusty.

550
00:58:35,641 --> 00:58:37,851
You move.

551
00:58:51,782 --> 00:58:54,243
Hey, what's up?
What are they doing? Come on.

552
00:58:54,284 --> 00:58:56,245
What are you doing?

553
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:57,871
Someone is dead.

554
00:58:58,872 --> 00:59:01,458
What will happen is
I go to the vaults ...

555
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,418
and I will ensure
leave nothing ...

556
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:05,671
there, to
to live our lives.

557
00:59:05,712 --> 00:59:07,756
Because otherwise ...

558
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:13,262
it's over. We will
screwed. Do you understand?

559
00:59:21,311 --> 00:59:22,604
Sasha ...

560
00:59:24,606 --> 00:59:25,941
Are you with me or not?

561
00:59:28,819 --> 00:59:30,279
Yes darling.

562
00:59:32,656 --> 00:59:34,199
Bum.

563
00:59:39,705 --> 00:59:41,748
Do not worry, these three are legit.

564
00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:43,750
- I'm sure.
- But you seem worried.

565
00:59:43,792 --> 00:59:46,503
I'm very worried.
Why it takes so long?

566
00:59:46,587 --> 00:59:49,464
- I do not know.
- Why it takes so long? Come on!

567
01:00:16,241 --> 01:00:17,784
But Father ...

568
01:00:18,577 --> 01:00:20,329
look at all this.

569
01:00:20,996 --> 01:00:23,832
Surely something is not right.

570
01:00:23,874 --> 01:00:25,584
Perhaps He wants you to reconsider.

571
01:00:25,626 --> 01:00:27,002
<I> "The what
arrogant enough ... </ i>

572
01:00:27,044 --> 01:00:28,670
<I> to question
the judge's verdict ... </ i>

573
01:00:28,754 --> 01:00:31,340
<I> or the priest who represents
the will of the Lord your God, </ i>

574
01:00:31,381 --> 01:00:34,760
<I> must die. "Deuteronomy 17:12. </ I>

575
01:00:55,405 --> 01:00:57,491
I have time.

576
01:00:58,283 --> 01:00:59,743
I wait for you.

577
01:01:00,953 --> 01:01:02,412
What the hell is this?

578
01:01:02,454 --> 01:01:04,873
- My wife is there.
- You want to wait and risk?

579
01:01:04,915 --> 01:01:06,944
Denise if not
you would be so impatient.

580
01:01:06,969 --> 01:01:07,793
You are right.

581
01:01:07,835 --> 01:01:10,879
Well, come on! I am going to
masturbate on everyone's lips.

582
01:01:11,421 --> 01:01:12,923
Now cover me, come on.

583
01:01:12,965 --> 01:01:15,467
There are two types of SWAT about
of you crack their ass,

584
01:01:15,509 --> 01:01:16,510
<I> at the south entrance. </ I>

585
01:01:16,552 --> 01:01:18,762
There are only two. Cover me.

586
01:01:20,973 --> 01:01:22,057
Shots!

587
01:01:22,307 --> 01:01:24,017
Comuníquenme with the Bank!

588
01:01:24,059 --> 01:01:27,688
Motherfuckers! So things will be?

589
01:01:29,439 --> 01:01:30,482
They gave!

590
01:01:30,566 --> 01:01:32,086
I told my guys were good.

591
01:01:34,528 --> 01:01:36,071
No problem, so good.

592
01:02:06,435 --> 01:02:08,020
Boomerang!

593
01:02:10,355 --> 01:02:12,524
Brilliant.

594
01:02:16,528 --> 01:02:18,530
You move.

595
01:02:29,625 --> 01:02:30,959
Captain, I have the hotline.

596
01:02:41,386 --> 01:02:42,804
The men are in place.

597
01:02:58,403 --> 01:02:59,488
Hello?

598
01:03:00,072 --> 01:03:02,950
This is Captain Howard.
With whom I speak?

599
01:03:02,991 --> 01:03:05,619
Yes, that's a question
stupid. Who do you speak?

600
01:03:06,411 --> 01:03:07,704
Fool.

601
01:03:10,082 --> 01:03:12,125
<I> is the type that is robbing the bank. </ I>

602
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,044
I heard shots.

603
01:03:14,127 --> 01:03:16,547
<I> What is going on there
inside? Are you all right? </ I>

604
01:03:16,713 --> 01:03:21,051
Of course there were shots!
They sent two guys from SWAT!

605
01:03:22,135 --> 01:03:24,721
I apologize for that,
it will not happen again.

606
01:03:26,557 --> 01:03:28,183
<I> Can we talk now? </ I>

607
01:03:29,059 --> 01:03:30,644
<I> What do you want exactly? </ I>

608
01:03:30,727 --> 01:03:33,605
They want to make a deal?
It's okay. I will offer one.

609
01:03:33,647 --> 01:03:34,982
It's very simple.

610
01:03:35,023 --> 01:03:38,610
You let us keep the money,
you let us go and there will be problems.

611
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:41,989
You know that's not going to happen.

612
01:03:42,156 --> 01:03:44,032
<I> Seriously. </ I>

613
01:03:44,116 --> 01:03:46,910
<I> Why do not you come to the
door and talk face to face? </ i>

614
01:03:47,995 --> 01:03:49,872
If it is okay. I imagined that.

615
01:03:49,913 --> 01:03:52,040
So why are we talking?

616
01:03:52,583 --> 01:03:55,043
This conversation is over. To hell!

617
01:03:59,965 --> 01:04:01,592
This is going to get ugly.

618
01:04:02,467 --> 01:04:03,635
Fuck.

619
01:04:04,469 --> 01:04:05,929
These guys are psychopaths.

620
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:08,182
Give me your intercom.

621
01:04:09,850 --> 01:04:12,394
Smith, Bishop. What is your situation?

622
01:04:12,436 --> 01:04:14,938
<I> position. Pending orders. </ I>

623
01:04:15,022 --> 01:04:16,482
Johnson, what's your situation?

624
01:04:16,523 --> 01:04:18,984
<I> Waiting for hostages. In place. </ I>

625
01:04:19,693 --> 01:04:22,362
Campbell and Williams,
What is your situation?

626
01:04:22,404 --> 01:04:25,032
<I> A Williams he was wounded.
The wound is slight. </ I>

627
01:04:25,073 --> 01:04:27,618
<I> I'm sorry, Captain, we were wrong. </ I>

628
01:04:27,701 --> 01:04:31,538
<I> - Do you think?
- Is my wife. It's in the bank. </ i>

629
01:04:34,249 --> 01:04:36,752
- Let them come the paramedics.
- Yes, Captain.

630
01:04:56,522 --> 01:04:57,940
This is to?

631
01:05:04,613 --> 01:05:06,198
Are you sure?

632
01:05:07,282 --> 01:05:08,700
It is blurred.

633
01:05:15,958 --> 01:05:17,084
You move.

634
01:05:17,584 --> 01:05:19,169
Stop looking at me!

635
01:05:20,796 --> 01:05:22,965
Grab that bastard.

636
01:05:25,217 --> 01:05:27,886
- Bring it here.
- Go Go!

637
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:32,933
Go Go! Go Go!

638
01:05:32,975 --> 01:05:35,894
You are crazy? What are we doing?

639
01:05:35,936 --> 01:05:36,937
Easy, easy.

640
01:05:36,979 --> 01:05:39,064
I do not want you in jail!

641
01:05:39,106 --> 01:05:42,151
I do not want to go to jail!
I do not want to go to jail!

642
01:05:54,788 --> 01:05:56,248
Fuck.

643
01:05:58,625 --> 01:05:59,918
Take that.

644
01:06:15,851 --> 01:06:18,854
Stand up! Can you walk?

645
01:06:25,319 --> 01:06:27,696
- What is the message?
- He will not want to see.

646
01:06:28,071 --> 01:06:29,948
<I> NEXT DIE </ i>

647
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:31,033
Heavens!

648
01:06:33,035 --> 01:06:35,621
Take him to Emergency. Fast!

649
01:06:37,164 --> 01:06:38,373
Motherfuckers.

650
01:06:48,091 --> 01:06:50,010
I see you got my message.

651
01:06:50,052 --> 01:06:54,264
Yes. I got your message. Loud and clear.

652
01:06:54,306 --> 01:06:55,682
<I> Listen well. </ I>

653
01:06:55,933 --> 01:06:58,685
Let's get out of here. Understood?

654
01:06:58,769 --> 01:07:01,230
<I> or receive another message
in a body bag. </ i>

655
01:07:01,396 --> 01:07:02,940
This clear?

656
01:07:02,981 --> 01:07:04,149
I understood.

657
01:07:04,399 --> 01:07:05,400
He is thirty minutes.

658
01:07:06,151 --> 01:07:08,987
Thirty minutes. It's okay.

659
01:07:44,690 --> 01:07:45,816
Your.

660
01:07:49,695 --> 01:07:51,113
- Your.
- Come on!

661
01:07:51,196 --> 01:07:53,282
Back! Back!

662
01:07:53,407 --> 01:07:55,742
She is pregnant! She is pregnant!

663
01:07:55,784 --> 01:07:58,120
- I do not give a shit.
- Sit down!

664
01:07:58,829 --> 01:08:03,083
- Please!
- Hold it there, everyone!

665
01:08:06,086 --> 01:08:09,256
Low hands, feet.
Look out.

666
01:08:09,298 --> 01:08:10,924
Stop looking at me!

667
01:08:13,177 --> 01:08:16,096
<I> Women Hostage in point
look, but no visual of the murderer. </ i>

668
01:08:18,682 --> 01:08:20,225
Yes, there is a movement.

669
01:08:20,976 --> 01:08:22,311
Hold your positions.

670
01:08:23,395 --> 01:08:27,149
Father, please. Help her.

671
01:08:27,316 --> 01:08:29,735
<I> A criminal is pointing
pregnant women ... </ i>

672
01:08:29,776 --> 01:08:31,320
<I> and keeps looking at his watch. </ I>

673
01:08:33,071 --> 01:08:34,364
Father, please, help.

674
01:08:40,496 --> 01:08:41,872
Paul.

675
01:08:44,208 --> 01:08:46,460
- I do not want to die!
- She wants not to die!

676
01:08:47,252 --> 01:08:48,921
I do not want to die.

677
01:08:49,379 --> 01:08:51,173
- She does not want to die.
- I know!

678
01:08:54,134 --> 01:08:55,969
Look out the window, do not look at me.

679
01:08:56,011 --> 01:08:58,889
I do not want to die. I do not want to die.

680
01:08:58,931 --> 01:09:01,016
Are you ready to die?

681
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:07,981
Please save her.

682
01:09:08,023 --> 01:09:09,191
Save her.

683
01:09:10,901 --> 01:09:13,403
<I> "Let us therefore,
boldly to the throne of grace, </ i>

685
01:09:17,115 --> 01:09:19,868
<I> and find grace to
timely relief. "</ i>

686
01:09:21,078 --> 01:09:23,205
Hebrews 4:16.

687
01:09:24,289 --> 01:09:25,958
<I> Campbell, do not. </ I>

688
01:09:26,875 --> 01:09:27,918
- Do not!
- Campbell.

689
01:09:28,126 --> 01:09:29,419
Campbell back here!

690
01:09:33,090 --> 01:09:34,174
What the hell is wrong with you?

691
01:09:36,343 --> 01:09:40,472
I can not, I can not ... I can not breathe.

692
01:09:41,223 --> 01:09:43,350
Breathing is the least
your problems, bitch.

693
01:09:43,392 --> 01:09:46,353
Better start praying to God,
It's the best thing you can do.

694
01:09:48,188 --> 01:09:49,940
I asked you if you are ready to die.

695
01:09:49,982 --> 01:09:51,942
I'm not here to
this shit, Bones.

696
01:09:51,984 --> 01:09:54,194
Drop your fucking gun.

697
01:09:54,236 --> 01:09:56,321
I told you to drop the weapon.

698
01:09:58,031 --> 01:10:00,075
You're crazy.

699
01:10:04,246 --> 01:10:05,914
Is this what we do?

700
01:10:05,956 --> 01:10:08,083
Not kill a baby.

701
01:10:11,336 --> 01:10:13,463
That's fucked up, man. What are you doing?

702
01:10:14,464 --> 01:10:16,508
So you plan to do this?

703
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,303
Will they soften with
a pregnant bitch?

704
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:21,221
Calm down.

705
01:10:22,347 --> 01:10:25,058
Where is Plan B? Not this.

706
01:10:26,935 --> 01:10:30,355
You are crazy? This sucks, Bones.

707
01:10:31,231 --> 01:10:33,150
This is stupid, idiot.

708
01:10:42,618 --> 01:10:43,911
Father...

709
01:10:48,123 --> 01:10:49,500
Enough!

710
01:10:49,541 --> 01:10:52,419
Give your inhaler. He can not breathe.

711
01:11:04,139 --> 01:11:05,557
Do not try to be a hero.

712
01:11:06,892 --> 01:11:08,310
Shut up!

713
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:34,336
There is.

714
01:11:46,557 --> 01:11:48,392
Fool.

715
01:11:53,147 --> 01:11:54,690
Did you do that?

716
01:12:15,544 --> 01:12:16,920
<I> Tiny? </ I>

717
01:12:16,962 --> 01:12:19,089
What's up man? What are they doing?

718
01:12:19,256 --> 01:12:20,507
We have company.

719
01:12:20,591 --> 01:12:22,217
<I> Yeah, do not tell me. </ I>

720
01:12:22,259 --> 01:12:24,511
<I> We have to go to Plan B, brother. </ I>

721
01:12:24,595 --> 01:12:26,388
They screwed!

722
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:28,474
Plan B! Did you hear Me?

723
01:12:28,682 --> 01:12:30,350
Very good. Plan B.

724
01:12:31,393 --> 01:12:33,520
It's showtime. Come on.

725
01:12:34,021 --> 01:12:35,731
It was time.

726
01:12:40,486 --> 01:12:42,029
What the fuck is B, Bones Plan?

727
01:12:50,454 --> 01:12:51,497
Here they come!

728
01:13:11,225 --> 01:13:12,392
Tiny! Gasoline!

729
01:13:17,439 --> 01:13:21,318
Tiny! Gasoline! Let's go!

730
01:13:22,236 --> 01:13:24,363
Fuck! Will you fly!

731
01:14:22,087 --> 01:14:23,755
Somebody turn off the heat!

732
01:14:40,606 --> 01:14:42,357
I see what you want to reach.

733
01:15:07,674 --> 01:15:08,800
I do not turn back!

734
01:15:12,513 --> 01:15:14,223
Get up, get up!

735
01:15:14,264 --> 01:15:16,517
Lift your ass! Arise!

736
01:15:16,558 --> 01:15:18,769
Or I'll blow your head off! Arise!

737
01:15:22,397 --> 01:15:24,858
Come on. Come on. Come here.

738
01:15:25,818 --> 01:15:27,152
Give me the mask!

739
01:15:28,362 --> 01:15:29,446
Give me the mask!

740
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:32,741
Wear it.

741
01:15:55,889 --> 01:15:58,517
He has a hostage! Stop the fire!

742
01:15:58,559 --> 01:16:00,310
Put the gun down!

743
01:16:03,564 --> 01:16:04,898
Put the gun down!

744
01:16:05,149 --> 01:16:07,609
You think
I'm playing, right?

745
01:16:07,651 --> 01:16:09,695
I'm going to kill this motherfucker.

746
01:16:10,362 --> 01:16:11,989
I want to live. I want to live!

747
01:16:15,534 --> 01:16:16,618
<I> You got a shot? </ I>

748
01:16:19,204 --> 01:16:20,205
I want to live!

749
01:16:21,748 --> 01:16:24,209
<I> Negative. Not a shot. </ i>

750
01:16:24,626 --> 01:16:25,794
I want to live!

751
01:16:30,841 --> 01:16:32,217
I want to live!

752
01:16:33,302 --> 01:16:34,386
I want to live!

753
01:16:36,513 --> 01:16:37,806
I want to live. I want to live!

754
01:16:37,848 --> 01:16:38,974
Now fire.

755
01:16:41,310 --> 01:16:42,603
I want to live!

756
01:16:53,739 --> 01:16:54,979
Shoot him a bastard.

757
01:17:08,253 --> 01:17:11,006
<I> "Everyone who calls on the
name of the Lord shall be saved. "</ i>

01:17:13,884 --> 01:17:15,552
Thank you.

<I> Mom is gone. </ I>

761
01:18:03,934 --> 01:18:06,687
Wear it! Wear it!

762
01:18:07,813 --> 01:18:08,939
Breathe.

763
01:18:24,496 --> 01:18:27,374
What are you doing, Rob? Get down!
You are in the firing line!

764
01:18:32,004 --> 01:18:35,007
OMG! Fuck! Rob!

765
01:18:35,048 --> 01:18:38,927
OMG! Come on! Come on!

766
01:18:38,969 --> 01:18:41,889
Go Go. Fuck!

767
01:18:44,349 --> 01:18:45,851
- Are you okay.
- I can not continue.

768
01:18:45,893 --> 01:18:47,895
Are you okay. Are you okay.
Come here, come here.

769
01:18:51,064 --> 01:18:53,108
- I'm fucked, Joey.
- Do not.

770
01:18:57,404 --> 01:19:00,991
No, Rob. Everything will be
all right. Everything will be fine.

771
01:19:01,742 --> 01:19:03,911
Think about it. This weekend
week will be on the beach.

772
01:19:03,952 --> 01:19:09,124
Do not? With whores and
beers. Fuck.

773
01:19:10,501 --> 01:19:12,544
Please Rob not.

774
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:17,799
I need you. It's my fault.
My fucking fault!

775
01:19:25,974 --> 01:19:27,935
I'll go with you anytime.

776
01:19:27,976 --> 01:19:29,978
I'm sorry, Rob.

777
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:31,897
I'm sorry...

778
01:19:58,715 --> 01:20:00,175
Checkmate.

779
01:20:19,736 --> 01:20:22,948
Honey, wait. What are you doing?

780
01:20:24,491 --> 01:20:27,703
You promised me, Joey. What are you doing?

781
01:20:33,959 --> 01:20:35,544
<I> </ i> is over.

782
01:20:56,690 --> 01:21:00,152
They killed my brother!
Fuck you!

783
01:21:16,543 --> 01:21:18,587
Do not!

784
01:21:36,104 --> 01:21:40,901
Hello. It seems you do not have
after all those years.

785
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:48,534
Is there any problem?

786
01:21:55,791 --> 01:21:57,584
Look, brother, I have all day.

787
01:21:59,545 --> 01:22:01,713
No, there is no problem.

788
01:22:02,548 --> 01:22:03,590
All right.

789
01:22:06,510 --> 01:22:08,929
No problem at all.

790
01:22:13,142 --> 01:22:14,560
Thank you.

791
01:22:15,561 --> 01:22:17,229
<I> ACT TO ETERNITY </ i>

792
01:22:19,773 --> 01:22:21,900
Make sure it is sent.

793
01:22:23,694 --> 01:22:24,945
Yes sir.

794
01:22:31,618 --> 01:22:34,329
See you very soon.

795
01:22:35,831 --> 01:22:36,999
Yes it is.

796
01:22:52,723 --> 01:22:54,600
Do not leave the building.

797
01:23:17,998 --> 01:23:20,626
I said do not leave the building!

798
01:23:26,131 --> 01:23:27,633
Get ready.

799
01:23:50,113 --> 01:23:51,406
Follow me, sir.

800
01:24:00,666 --> 01:24:02,960
- She's all yours, Captain.
- Thank you.

801
01:24:06,296 --> 01:24:08,799
Gee, honey, you're very brave.

802
01:24:08,841 --> 01:24:10,884
God, I love you so much!
Please do.

803
01:24:13,303 --> 01:24:14,346
We'll have a family.

804
01:24:26,108 --> 01:24:29,361
Hey, this agreement does not
It worked for anyone.

805
01:24:30,404 --> 01:24:34,158
But I think I found a solution
that will please all of us.

806
01:24:36,118 --> 01:24:39,371
Why must
listen to this cockroach?

807
01:24:41,957 --> 01:24:43,333
We go now.

808
01:24:44,376 --> 01:24:46,253
No I do not believe it.

809
01:24:55,971 --> 01:24:58,849
Welcome to my fucking world!

810
01:25:55,489 --> 01:25:57,950
Where are you going? I do not think so!

811
01:25:59,159 --> 01:26:03,121
Do not move or I'll blow your head.

812
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:07,084
Where is my document?

813
01:26:10,921 --> 01:26:12,840
I would not do that in your place.

814
01:26:13,924 --> 01:26:18,178
Remember that it is impossible for me to fail.

815
01:26:23,183 --> 01:26:24,518
Checkmate!

816
01:26:29,022 --> 01:26:31,066
Get out of here!

817
01:26:35,404 --> 01:26:38,031
Yes, it's checkmate for now.

818
01:26:38,073 --> 01:26:40,492
But I'll see you later.

819
01:26:40,534 --> 01:26:42,953
You can count on that.

820
01:26:54,339 --> 01:26:56,884
I went in and was at the cashier,

821
01:26:57,134 --> 01:26:59,928
and the girl came out of nowhere.

822
01:26:59,970 --> 01:27:02,890
The guard and I did not expect.

823
01:27:04,057 --> 01:27:06,185
I'm sorry. I must attend
the call. Is my wife.

824
01:27:06,226 --> 01:27:08,437
- I will contact you.
- Thank you.

825
01:27:10,314 --> 01:27:11,523
Hi dear.

826
01:27:22,201 --> 01:27:24,620
OMG. Thank you.

827
01:27:24,870 --> 01:27:28,081
Is incredible! Amazing.

828
01:27:29,082 --> 01:27:30,417
We'll be fine, honey.

829
01:27:36,215 --> 01:27:39,092
Johnson, that was an incredible shot.

830
01:27:39,134 --> 01:27:41,178
Lord, I did not shoot today.

831
01:28:02,908 --> 01:28:05,577
- Christopher ...
- What, Mom?

832
01:28:09,289 --> 01:28:12,459
How are you?

833
01:28:15,170 --> 01:28:17,506
I have good news.

834
01:28:20,092 --> 01:28:22,469
They have a heart for you.

835
01:28:32,229 --> 01:28:34,189
You will be fine.

836
01:28:37,151 --> 01:28:38,443
I love you, Mom.

837
01:29:27,034 --> 01:29:28,994
