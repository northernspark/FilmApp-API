00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,920
Bonjour monsieur.

3
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,590
Bonjour.

4
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,760
Bonjour monsieur. Say bonjour.

5
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,260
Bonjour.

6
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,060
Once upon a time...

7
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,100
there was a quiet
little village

8
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,060
in the French countryside

9
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,190
whose people believed in tranquilite

10
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,320
Tranquility.

11
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,620
Come holy ghost

12
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,370
Creator come

13
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:08,540
From thy bright
heavenly throne

14
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:14,420
Come take possession
ofour souls

15
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:21,840
And make them all thine own

16
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,600
Far from us drive our...

17
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,970
Ifyou lived in this village...

18
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,520
you understood what was expected ofyou.

19
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,270
...unto us bring

20
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,190
And through all...

21
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,440
You knewyour place

22
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,740
in the scheme ofthings.

23
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,490
Lead us safe

24
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,200
And ifyou happened to forget...

25
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,200
someone would help remind you.

26
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,920
The season of Lent is upon us.

27
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,300
This is, ofcourse, a time ofabstinence.

28
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:07,640
Hopefully, also a time of reflection.

29
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,310
Above all, let this be for us a time...

30
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,900
A time ofsincere penitence.

31
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,400
It is a time to stand up and be counted.

32
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,820
In this village...

33
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,410
ifyou saw something
you weren't supposed to see

34
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,330
you learned to look the other way.

35
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,120
This is a time for Christ.

36
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,000
When you reflect, he knows what you reflect on.

37
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,250
If by chance

38
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,380
your hopes had been disappointed...

39
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:39,170
you learned never to ask for more.

40
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,260
He knows forwhat you must be forgiven.

41
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,850
So in this year ofour lord, 1959, things...

42
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,470
So, through good times and bad...

43
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,310
famine and feast...

44
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:56,190
the villagers held fast to their traditions.

45
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,190
Until...

46
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,030
one winter day...

47
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:03,950
a sly wind blew in from the north.

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,290
Where will we find truth?

49
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,920
Where do we start looking?

50
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,590
Where will we find truth?

51
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,050
We will find it...

52
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,110
Who the hell are you?

53
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,660
We're here about the patisserie.

54
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,870
We'd like to rent it.

55
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,950
And the apartment above.

56
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,370
Where are you from?

57
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:38,710
Well, we lived in Andalusia for a while.

58
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,540
Let me see. Before that...

59
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,550
Vienna...

60
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,760
and before that...

61
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,760
Before that...

62
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,760
Athens.

63
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,930
- Pavia.
- Pavia, yes.

64
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,090
Pantoufle hated it there.

65
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,470
Pantoufle is her kangaroo.

66
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,390
But he can't hop.

67
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,690
Bad leg. War injury, huh?

68
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,580
I'll expect you to keep it in good condition.

69
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,180
What a nice town this is.

70
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,850
Don't you think so, Mama?

71
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,940
It's a lovely town.

72
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:46,440
Mama, Pantoufle wants to know
how long we can stay.

73
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,320
Tell Pantoufle not to worry.

74
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,240
Time for bed. What story tonight?

75
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,700
Pantoufle wants to hear
about Grandmère and Grandpère.

76
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,040
Not tonight, Anouska.

77
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,500
You always say that.

78
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,090
Tell about Grandmère and Grandpère

79
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,670
Not tonight.

80
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,800
How about the princess and the pirates?

81
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,640
Ok.

82
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,430
Prepare to fire!

83
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,140
All hands on deck!

84
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,060
Ready, aim...

85
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,600
fire!

86
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,320
Forgive the intrusion.

87
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,150
It's a pleasure.

88
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,450
Sorry, monsieur.

89
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,080
Pirate attack.

90
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,160
Ofcourse.

91
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,660
What is your name?

92
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,870
Anouk. What's yours?

93
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,830
I am the Comte de Reynaud at your service.

94
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,500
A real one?

95
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,710
Like the Comte de Monte Cristo?

96
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,300
He was not a real one.

97
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,800
To what do we owe the honor ofyour visit?

98
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,140
Well, as mayor of Lansquenet...

99
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,600
I want to welcome you
to the community

100
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,480
and to invite you to worship
with us at mass on Sunday.

101
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,860
That's very kind ofyou,
but actually we don't attend.

102
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,570
We're glad to be so near the church though.

103
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:12,610
We'll enjoy singing with the bells...

104
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,860
won't we, Nou-Nou?

105
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:17,530
The bells are not intended
as an entertainment, madame.

106
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,450
They are a solemn call to worship for-

107
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,370
Mademoiselle.

108
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,540
I beg your pardon?

109
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,580
Mademoiselle. I've never been married...

110
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,330
but feel free to call me Vianne.

111
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,260
I do hope you'll stop by

112
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,970
when I open for business next week.

113
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,720
Yes.

114
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,470
Yes, opening a patisserie
during the holy Lenten fast.

115
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,220
I could imagine better timing.

116
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,730
Oh, but it's not going to be a patisserie.

117
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,390
Then what do you intend to—

118
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,310
It's a surprise.

119
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,940
It was sweet ofyou to drop by.

120
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,410
The Comte de Reynaud

121
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:04,330
was a student of history
and therefore a patient man.

122
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:08,540
He trusted the wisdom ofgenerations past.

123
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:12,550
Like his ancestors, he watched
over the little village

124
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,630
Bonjour.

125
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,880
and led by his own example-

126
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:19,890
Hard work, modesty...

127
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,890
self-discipline.

128
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,780
I have completed the 18th century.

129
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,700
Madame Clairmont.

130
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,620
Your letter to the editor, Monsieur le Comte.

131
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,120
This paragraph about family
and tradition, it's...

132
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,290
It's beautiful.

133
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,460
Well, thankyou.

134
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,300
I value your opinion.

135
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,270
May I ask,
have you been in contact

136
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,600
with your mother recently?

137
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,810
Why?

138
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,610
She seems to have rented out the patisserie.

139
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:20,110
Well, I haven't
talked to my mother

140
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,240
in quite a while.

141
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,280
Oh, I'm sorry. I did not mean to pry.

142
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,080
Oh, don't be silly.

143
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,250
I have no secrets from you.

144
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,420
How is the comtesse enjoying Venice?

145
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,510
The comtesse? Oh, she's fine, thankyou.

146
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:39,170
Yes, she's enjoying it very much.

147
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,850
Venice.

148
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,820
I heard she was some kind of radical.

149
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,630
I heard she's an atheist.

150
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,350
What's that?

151
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,890
Don't know.

152
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:41,900
Come on.

153
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,580
You should be more careful!

154
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,380
So sorry, madame.

155
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,550
I'm sorry.

156
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,800
Are you all right?

157
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,420
I'm fine, I'm fine.

158
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,840
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

159
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:44,970
Do you want to come in and sit down?

160
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,180
No, no. Please don't trouble yourself.

161
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,390
I'm fine.

162
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:50,060
No, it's no trouble. I'm Vianne Rocher.

163
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,600
Caroline Clairmont.

164
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,020
I'm the daughter ofyour landlady.

165
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,020
This is my son Luc.

166
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,400
Oh, hello. And this is my Anouk.

167
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,650
Come in, please, where it's warm.

168
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,320
Try this.

169
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,610
I bet you've never
had hot chocolate

170
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:05,150
made from a 2,000-year-old recipe.

171
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,660
Thankyou, but no. Luc.

172
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:08,990
No.

173
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:12,870
What's this?

174
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,580
What do you see, madame, in this?

175
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,960
Sorry?

176
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,670
What does it look like to you?

177
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,420
Just say the first thing

178
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,880
that comes into your mind.

179
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,550
A woman riding a wild horse?

180
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:31,760
Oh, silly answer.

181
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,310
Oh, no. There are no silly answers.

182
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,270
The pepper triangle, that's foryou.

183
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,310
A tiny hint ofchili pepper

184
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,020
to play against the sweetness.

185
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,570
Tangy, adventurous.

186
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,580
What do you see?

187
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,750
I see teeth.

188
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,630
I see blood...

189
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,050
and a skull.

190
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,470
Very dark.

191
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,970
Bitter chocolate. That's your favorite.

192
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,060
Which will have to wait 5 weeks more.

193
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,890
Lent. Thankyou.

194
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,900
We must run along. It's been nice to meet you.

195
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,900
Come.

196
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,230
My pleasure.

197
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,440
Pantoufle, come on! Pirate attack!

198
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,990
How much are those chili things, please?

199
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,660
4.50 a box.

200
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,120
Could you put a ribbon on it?

201
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,080
Then I can pretend they are from my husband.

202
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,750
Ofcourse.

203
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,800
Josephine Muscat.

204
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,960
She waltzes to her own tune.

205
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,680
And these are foryour husband—

206
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,850
Unrefined cocoa nips from Guatemala—

207
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,720
To awaken the passions.

208
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,600
You've obviously never met my husband.

209
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:05,770
You've obviously never tried these.

210
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,090
Don't be pathetic.

211
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,030
Luc.

212
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,620
You've got a tiny error in problem 6—

213
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,910
Luc!

214
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,170
It's nothing.

215
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,670
It already stopped.

216
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,880
Mother, the new teacher

217
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,300
wants us to correct our own mistakes.

218
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,890
I didn't tell you how to correct the mistake...

219
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:18,010
I just told you that you made one.

220
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,760
Not hungry, Monsieur le Comte?

221
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,680
The Lenten fast, Madame Rivet.

222
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,600
Are you not supposed to eat something?

223
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,770
It's all right. Leave it.

224
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,660
Hello.

225
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:50,290
May I help you?

226
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:55,380
It's expensive. I don't waste money.

227
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,590
I have a knack for guessing people's favorites.

228
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:04,930
These are your favorites. Am I right?

229
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,060
On the house.

230
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,730
I think I'd bet—

231
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,360
Well...

232
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,240
This certainly is different.

233
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,450
Yes. Very different.

234
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,660
Look at that.

235
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,630
I'm so sorry.

236
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,670
Bonjour Monsieur Blerot.

237
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,670
Bonjour Madame Audel.

238
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,270
No. Not that way, Charlie.

239
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,650
Come on.

240
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,820
Come in! Please.

241
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,480
Come on, boy.

242
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:00,780
I've got something foryou.

243
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,580
What's your name?

244
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,160
Charlie. He's 14 years old.

245
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,830
That's 98 in human years.

246
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,830
No, I meant your name.

247
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,750
Guillaume Blerot.

248
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,840
You're very kind.

249
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,170
He has so few pleasures left.

250
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,340
Would you care...

251
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,510
Would you care to buy...

252
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,520
something special foryour lady friend?

253
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,350
Lady friend?

254
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,770
The lovely woman

255
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,520
your dog was so fond of.

256
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,570
Her favorite is chocolate seashells.

257
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:41,900
That's my guess.

258
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,530
Oh, no. I mustn't.

259
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,530
Madame Audel is in mourning for her husband.

260
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,950
Oh, I'm sorry.

261
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,700
When did he pass away?

262
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:55,000
The war. German grenade.

263
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,880
Well, it's been 15 years since the war, so...

264
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,500
- Not that war.
- Surely...

265
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,880
MonsieurAudel was killed on January 12, 191 7.

266
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:09,100
It was quite a blow to Madame Audel.

267
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,140
Apparently so.

268
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,900
Bonjour mesdames!

269
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,320
Bonjour Monsieur le Comte.

270
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,740
I wish all my tenants

271
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,280
were as reliable as you, Madame Drou.

272
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,370
How is the comtesse enjoying Italy?

273
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,580
She may be extending her trip.

274
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:39,670
Very nice.

275
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,880
Have either ofyou seen

276
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,920
the new shop across the square?

277
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:48,430
Oh, the chocolaterie? Yes.

278
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,890
Shameless, isn't it?

279
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,390
The sheer nerve ofthe woman...

280
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,270
opening a chocolaterie just in time for Lent.

281
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,230
The woman is brazen.

282
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,030
My heart goes out to that poor

283
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:09,280
illegitimate child of hers.

284
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,320
Oh, yeah.

285
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,330
Bonjour.

286
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,880
You ain't nothin'
but a hound dog

287
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,800
Cryin' all the time

288
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,010
You ain't nothin'
but a hound dog

289
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:30,590
Cryin' all the time

290
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,970
Well, you ain't never
caught no rabbit

291
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,140
You ain't no friend of mine

292
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,430
Ooh, yeah!

293
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,730
A new addition to the liturgy?

294
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,650
I have a weakness for American music...

295
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,520
Monsieur le Comte.

296
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,900
How long have you been with us, Père Henri?

297
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,860
It will be... 5 weeks.

298
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,950
Your predecessor, Père Michel...

299
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:55,450
he was with us for...5 decades.

300
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,290
Yes, well, I only pray

301
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,830
I can live up to Père Michel's example.

302
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,290
Yes, that's my prayer also.

303
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,590
I looked at your sermon, as you requested.

304
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,420
I've made one or 2 notes.

305
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,220
You're very kind.

306
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,970
Not at all.

307
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,310
Oh, one more thing.

308
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,690
Ifyou haven't seen the new chocolaterie..

309
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:25,150
perhaps you might like to take a look.

310
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,280
It's important to know one's enemy.

311
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,200
Don't you think?

312
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,200
Hey, where's my kiss?

313
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,120
Watch where you're going!

314
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:43,120
Excuse me!

315
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:45,380
Hello. Morning.

316
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:50,340
What's the decor, early Mexican brothel?

317
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:04,190
No! If I need help, I'll ask for it.

318
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,150
What do you see in it?

319
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,030
Not a damn thing.

320
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,570
Come on. It's a game.

321
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,120
What do you see?

322
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,160
I see a cranky old woman
too tired to play games.

323
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,920
I've gotjust the thing foryou.

324
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,090
That little girl ofyours...

325
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,590
does she mind it?

326
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,840
Mind what?

327
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,340
The way you move her from place to place.

328
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,760
She's doing fine. I think it's good for her.

329
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:42,140
You know, seeing new places...

330
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:42,980
meeting new people.

331
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:49,520
Your cinnamon looks rancid.

332
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:51,280
Well, it's not cinnamon.

333
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,110
It's a special kind ofchili pepper.

334
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,360
Chili pepper in hot chocolate?

335
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:56,740
It'll give you a lift.

336
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,700
There.

337
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,310
It tastes like...

338
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,680
I don't know.

339
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,230
Hop, hop, hop, hop!

340
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,150
Where's your kangaroo?

341
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,490
Hop, hop, hop!

342
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,240
I'm your kangaroo now!

343
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:44,700
Stop it!

344
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:47,670
Anouk! In this school, we are civilized.

345
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,580
We do not strike one another!

346
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,460
But they insulted Pantoufle!

347
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,840
I don't care. Didi, Dedou, come along!

348
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,760
And be quiet.

349
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,810
Where's Pantoufle?

350
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,650
My mother says you don't have a father.

351
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,860
Sure I do.

352
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,610
Wejust don't know who he is.

353
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,610
I was out all night with him.

354
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,950
We swam naked in the tannes.

355
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,410
At dawn, when I returned to my house in my bed...

356
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,790
my mother poked her head in and said...

357
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,920
"Wake up, sleepyhead."

358
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,540
She had no idea I'd been gone.

359
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,400
Sure you didn't put booze in there?

360
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,150
Nah. Something better.

361
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,780
Perhaps you should give it to my daughter.

362
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:01,530
Melt that chilly disposition of hers.

363
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,620
You and Caroline have a problem?

364
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,660
Do we have a problem?

365
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,250
She won't let me see my grandson.

366
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,670
I'm cut offfrom him.

367
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,960
Why is that?

368
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:18,550
Armande, why is that?

369
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,340
Oh, I'm a bad influence.

370
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:26,100
'Cause I don't like her treating
him like a trained poodle.

371
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:29,350
I swear, that boy doesn't piss
without her permission.

372
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,690
Ever since her husband died...

373
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:36,610
she's been so...

374
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:45,120
The way she frets and fusses over that boy.

375
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,450
Ifonly she'd let him run, let him breathe...

376
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,870
let him live.

377
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,880
But she worries that he will overexert himself.

378
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,540
Not much danger ofthat.

379
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:59,210
She won't even let the poor kid ride a bicycle.

380
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,550
Do you think he'd like to see you?

381
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:09,720
Do you have more ofthose bean thingies, please?

382
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:11,480
Oh, sure.

383
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:14,810
How many do you want?

384
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,940
How many have you got?

385
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,610
Jack of hearts is a better hunter than you, eh?

386
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,910
Shoots the trump from right out underyour nose.

387
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,340
Are you Serge Muscat?

388
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,760
The one and only. What's your pleasure?

389
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,510
Is yourwife here?

390
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,840
Josephine?

391
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:49,930
Well, it depends what you want with Josephine.

392
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:53,350
Oh, she left this at my shop.

393
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,770
Well, let me have it. I'll give it to her.

394
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:00,320
Oh, no. I'll give it to her myself, thanks.

395
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,030
Got to go. I'm late for supper.

396
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,740
But the game's not overyet.

397
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,330
Do you want to play?

398
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,330
You know belote?

399
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:14,540
Ofcourse I do.

400
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,460
Sit down.

401
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,630
Josephine.

402
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,250
Hello.

403
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,050
What do you want?

404
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,340
You forgot this.

405
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,720
What do you want?

406
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,100
To be your friend.

407
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:34,890
I don't have friends.
Does serge know you're here?

408
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,980
Does it matter?

409
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:41,190
Do me a favor. Try one ofthese rose creams.

410
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,190
Tell me ifyou think

411
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,360
it's a little heavy on the Cointreau.

412
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:02,340
Josephine!

413
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,260
I'm coming!

414
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,720
He talks about you.

415
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,020
He says you're indecent.

416
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,890
He says you're an influence.

417
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,480
You're a bad influence for someone like me—

418
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,650
I don't have
to listen to a word

419
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:24,440
your husband has to say.

420
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:25,900
No, not Serge.

421
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,450
Not him.

422
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,740
Reynaud, the mayor.

423
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,200
He talks about you.

424
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,210
Time to go.

425
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,050
Look what I won.

426
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:47,720
That's good. Come on.

427
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,730
Bonsoir.

428
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:20,120
Luc, mind if I take a peek?

429
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,670
It's not really...

430
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,960
Show me.

431
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,340
Well, I exaggerated the angle ofthe head.

432
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,550
You draw beautifully.

433
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,300
What's your going rate?

434
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,390
What?

435
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,350
To do a portrait?

436
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:39,230
How much would you charge?

437
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,270
Oh, I...

438
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:44,730
I couldn't. I'm not really a...

439
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,860
50 francs?

440
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,360
Sound reasonable?

441
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,940
It'd be great.

442
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:53,280
When could you come by my shop?

443
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,540
I'm really sorry, but...

444
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,450
the comte forbids it.

445
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,040
He spoke to Mama this morning...

446
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:08,800
and a lot ofothers.

447
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:13,300
Whateveryou say.

448
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:17,310
I wish I could. I really do.

449
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,350
Thanks for showing me your drawing.

450
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,190
Wait.

451
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,920
Am I breaking any laws?

452
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:53,630
Tell me! Am I hurting anyone?

453
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,090
You're asking me my opinion?

454
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:59,640
What exactly have you been
telling people about me?

455
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,890
Only the truth, mademoiselle.

456
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,520
Well...

457
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,600
ifyou're expecting me...

458
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:10,360
tojust shrivel up and blow away...

459
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,530
you're going to be highly disappointed.

460
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,990
Let me try and put this
into perspective foryou.

461
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,370
The first Comte de Reynaud

462
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,830
expelled all
the radical Huguenots

463
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,790
from this village.

464
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,760
You and your truffles present
a far lesser challenge.

465
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,970
You'll be out of business by Easter.

466
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:40,180
I promise you that.

467
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,590
How long have you been standing here?

468
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,880
I forgot to payyou for something the other day.

469
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,220
I'm sorry.

470
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,880
No, it was a gift.

471
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:21,470
No. People talk.

472
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,770
No, people would lie about me.

473
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,440
I don't steal.

474
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,350
Not on purpose.

475
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,560
I—

476
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,270
Yes, I know.

477
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,610
It's nice to see you.

478
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,610
Would you like to come in for some chocolates?

479
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:54,300
This is foryou.

480
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,630
How sweet ofyou.

481
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,800
Thankyou.

482
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,300
It's lovely.

483
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,480
I heard you don't go to church.

484
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,810
That's right.

485
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,440
You won't last long here.

486
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,950
People talk.

487
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:25,030
Oh, sorry.

488
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,410
I'm behaving badly, aren't I?

489
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,910
No, no, it's ok.

490
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,460
You don't misbehave here.

491
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:33,210
It'sjust not done, did you know that?

492
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,090
Ifyou don't go to confession

493
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,840
Or ifyou don't...
dig your flower beds

494
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:42,090
Or ifyou don't pretend...

495
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,350
Ifyou don't pretend...

496
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:47,560
that you want nothing
more in your life

497
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,140
than to serve your
husband 3 meals a day

498
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,440
and give him children

499
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,150
and vacuum under his ass...

500
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:56,900
then... then you're... then you're crazy.

501
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:08,200
You must think I'm stupid to stay with him.

502
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,580
No, I don't thinkyou're... you're stupid.

503
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:17,800
Well, I am. I... I'm weak.

504
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,170
I don't love my husband, and I lie.

505
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:26,300
Things could be different foryou,Josephine.

506
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:29,270
Serge doesn't run the world.

507
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:31,980
He might as well.

508
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,100
Is that what you believe?

509
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:36,230
I know it.

510
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:41,940
Then it must be true.

511
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,240
My mistake.

512
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,660
You make the most wonderful chocolate.

513
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,340
Pantoufle wants
to hear the story

514
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,760
of Grandmère and Grandpère.

515
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:07,550
Don't say, "not tonight."
You always say, "not tonight."

516
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,390
All right, all right.

517
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,310
Your grandfather...

518
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,320
George Rocher...

519
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,480
was the young apothecary

520
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:23,990
ofthe town ofAulus-Les-Bains.

521
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:26,110
It was Anouk's favorite story.

522
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,070
Always told in the same words.

523
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,370
George was honest...

524
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:32,750
George was honest, prosperous...

525
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:35,920
and trusted by his customers.

526
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,710
But George was not content.

527
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,710
He felt there
should be more to life

528
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,170
than dispensing liver oil.

529
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:47,720
In the spring of 1927...

530
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,640
the Societe Pharmeceutique

531
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,430
formed an expedition
to Central America

532
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,640
to study
the medicinal properties

533
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,270
ofcertain natural compounds.

534
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:02,900
George was the expedition's
most eager volunteer.

535
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:09,320
But his adventure took a turn he did not expect.

536
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:16,580
One night, he was invited
to drink unrefined cacao

537
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,250
with a pinch ofchili.

538
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:22,420
The very same drink
the ancient Maya

539
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,920
used in their sacred ceremonies.

540
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:29,890
The Maya believed
cacao held the power

541
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:32,430
to unlock hidden yearnings.

542
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,390
And reveal destinies.

543
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,480
And so it was

544
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,650
that George first saw Chitza.

545
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,530
Now, George had been raised a good catholic...

546
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:56,250
but in his romance with Chitza...

547
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:58,500
he was willing
to slightly bend the rules

548
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,540
ofChristian courtship.

549
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,840
The tribal elders tried
to warn George about her.

550
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,380
She was one ofthe wanderers.

551
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:11,220
Her people moved
with the north wind

552
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,800
from village to village...

553
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:15,600
dispensing ancient remedies...

554
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,020
never settling down.

555
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,520
Not a good choice for a bride.

556
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:24,610
George did not heed their warning...

557
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:27,070
and for a while,
it seemed that he and Chitza

558
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:29,650
might lead a happy life together in France.

559
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:37,160
Alas, the clever north wind had other plans.

560
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,510
One morning,
George awoke to discover

561
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:52,050
that Chitza and the little girl Vianne...

562
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,430
had gone away.

563
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:58,520
Mother and daughter

564
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,690
were fated to wander from village to village...

565
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:05,730
dispensing ancient cacao remedies...

566
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,150
traveling with the wind.

567
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,780
Just as Chitza's people had done...

568
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,950
for generations.

569
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:15,240
Just as Chitza's people

570
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:17,450
had done for generations.

571
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:22,580
Will itjust go on forever?

572
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,590
Night, Mama.

573
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,820
I appreciate your coming in, Armande.

574
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,400
All right, what's so important

575
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:54,240
that I had to postpone my nap?

576
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,160
I've got some chocolate cake.

577
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:11,800
Grandmother. Grandmother, bonjour.

578
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,180
May I—

579
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:20,680
Would you like a cup of-

580
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:24,310
No. No, thankyou, I'm just here to...

581
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:25,520
do a portrait.

582
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,940
Whose?

583
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,820
Yours, actually.

584
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,320
Is the light ok where she's sitting?

585
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:42,660
I have something foryou, boy.

586
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,580
I've been carrying it around
since your last birthday.

587
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,300
It's a book of poetry.

588
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:58,090
Thankyou.

589
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,800
You don't like poetry?

590
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:04,140
Oh, no, no, no. Ofcourse, I do.

591
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,390
Yes.

592
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,890
Neither do I.

593
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,560
It's not that kind of poetry.

594
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:17,820
And in a moment ofweakness...

595
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,820
I prayed to the virgin mother

596
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:22,830
to soothe Charlie's soul
in his hour ofsuffering.

597
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:27,830
You understand an animal has no immortal soul.

598
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,830
I understand, monpère

599
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,420
Yet you flout god's law.

600
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,340
I'm weak and a sinner.

601
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,420
What else?

602
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:42,890
Impure thoughts.

603
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:45,970
The woman who runs the chocolaterie

604
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,310
Vianne Rocher?

605
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:49,350
She suggested I buy
chocolate seashells

606
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,400
for the widow Audel.

607
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,190
And, well...

608
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,690
I guess that got me to thinking

609
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,240
about the widow Audel.

610
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:02,240
At her age? At your age?

611
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:06,080
Yes. And yes.

612
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,250
And just what were you doing

613
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:10,620
in a chocolaterie during Lent?

614
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:13,710
It was for Charlie.

615
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,880
Again you flout God's law.

616
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:23,850
Well, but ifCharlie has no soul...

617
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:27,270
then there's no harm in him breaking Lent.

618
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:29,730
Isn't that so, monpère?

619
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,440
10 Hail Marys, 20 Our Fathers.

620
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,570
"Will she never have done, then...

621
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:43,240
that ghoul queen ofa million dead bodies?

622
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,910
I see myselfagain...

623
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:49,080
skin rotten with mud and pest...

624
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:54,460
worms in my armpits and in my hair."

625
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,880
It's perfectly wretched, isn't it?

626
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,550
Perfectly.

627
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:04,640
Would you like some cake?

628
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,180
I'm not supposed to.

629
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:10,810
Don't worry so much about not supposed to.

630
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,360
Live a little.

631
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,700
Oh, her hair appointment's almost done.

632
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:29,870
I have to go.

633
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:31,370
What about my picture?

634
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,910
Next time.

635
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:37,250
Thankyou for the cake.

636
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,920
Don't look so damn pleased with yourself.

637
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:53,770
Stay here.

638
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,650
I did it.

639
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:07,740
I did it. He...

640
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,740
He was so drunk.

641
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:14,000
He... He woke up.

642
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:17,040
He woke up. He saw me packing, but...

643
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:18,500
so he tried to come after me...

644
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:22,340
but I had already tied
his feet with his belt, and...

645
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,510
Boom! Right on his face.

646
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:34,430
Right there on his big, red face.

647
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:48,910
It is so stupid, isn't it?

648
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:52,040
I never blame him.

649
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:56,830
Sometimes I even forget what really happened.

650
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:10,550
I saved her!

651
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,310
You remember her father

652
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:14,180
collaborated with the Germans?

653
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:16,060
Nobody wanted to touch her.

654
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,150
Except for me.

655
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:20,060
And this is the way she repays me?!

656
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:21,440
Your anger is understandable.

657
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,610
Anger? Everybody's gonna be laughing at me!

658
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:26,070
That is not your concern.

659
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:28,450
Your concern is the sacrament of marriage.

660
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,280
Yeah, ofcourse. The sacrament.

661
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:32,740
Yes.

662
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:35,410
Dip the ganshbe into the white chocolate.

663
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:37,910
Like this?

664
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,540
Good. Yes, shake it, a little.

665
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:42,590
Good.

666
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:44,920
Put it on the parchment sheet.

667
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,210
You're doing great.

668
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:51,680
I'll be right back.

669
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:01,440
Good morning.

670
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,230
Can I interest you in some nipples ofVenus?

671
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:08,030
Rumor has it that you are
harboring Madam Muscat.

672
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:10,200
Is that true?

673
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,990
You make her sound like a fugitive.

674
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:14,490
She is a fugitive, from her marriage vows...

675
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:16,700
which have been sanctified by God.

676
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,170
Josephine?

677
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:22,710
Come out here a minute.

678
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,470
Let his radiance have a look at you.

679
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,720
Is that sanctified enough foryou?

680
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:37,890
It's not the first time.

681
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,770
I'm truly sorry.

682
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:44,230
You should have come to me.

683
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,820
Your husband will be made to repent for this.

684
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:51,240
Tell him to repent on someone else's head.

685
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,200
Come on. In!

686
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,240
Monsieur le Comte!

687
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:57,450
I'm going to make an example ofyou.

688
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,960
In there.

689
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,210
He's ready.

690
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:03,630
Well, but confession
must be made

691
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:05,710
in the spirit ofcontrition.

692
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,260
Have you come in the spirit ofcontrition?

693
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:09,630
Contrition, yes.

694
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,420
He's ready.

695
00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:15,680
Licentiousness...

696
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,350
idolatry, sorcery...

697
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:20,390
gluttony, and drunkenness.

698
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,940
Correct.

699
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:24,650
And what are the 3 conditions

700
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:26,650
for mortal sin?

701
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:27,730
Serge?

702
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:30,650
Mortal sin...

703
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:36,490
is sin whose object is...

704
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:39,620
committed by...

705
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:42,040
deliberate...

706
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,330
Consequence...

707
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,540
Incorrect. Didi?

708
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:49,550
Mortal sin is sin whose object is grave matter...

709
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:52,050
which is committed
with full knowledge

710
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:53,840
and deliberate consent.

711
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:54,880
Correct.

712
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,900
So, how do you know

713
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,980
ifthe coverture is properly tempered?

714
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:13,650
Ahh, first you check to see
if it's at body temperature.

715
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:17,070
Then you dip the palette knife

716
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,700
to see that the coverture hardens on it evenly.

717
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:20,740
Correct.

718
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,370
Closer.

719
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,800
In the village, time passed.

720
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:39,600
And the chocolaterie did not go out of business.

721
00:49:58,490 --> 00:49:59,910
The Comte de Reynaud

722
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:03,750
felt himself being drawn into a strange crusade.

723
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:10,960
His struggle to transform Serge
into a gentleman

724
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:14,840
became more than an act ofgood will.

725
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,470
It became a test...

726
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:21,260
a holy war between château...

727
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:23,560
and chocolaterie.

728
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:47,910
Each time, I...

729
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,830
I tell myself it's the last time.

730
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,000
But then I...

731
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:55,920
I get a whiffofa hot chocolate.

732
00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:58,720
Or... Or those moon things.

733
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,050
Chocolate seashells.

734
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:04,010
So small, so plain, so innocent.

735
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,350
I thought,just one little taste...

736
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:08,390
it can't do any harm.

737
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,100
But it turned out
that they were filled

738
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:12,560
with rich, sinful...

739
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:13,690
Buttery filling...

740
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:16,110
and it melts, god forgive me...

741
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:18,860
it melts ever-so-slowly
on your tongue

742
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:21,070
and tortures you with pleasure.

743
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,620
Against you alone, have I sinned.

744
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:26,240
And done what is evil in your sight.

745
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:32,330
Indeed I was born guilty...

746
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:35,960
a sinnerwhen my mother conceived me.

747
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:37,880
You desire truth in the inward being...

748
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:41,470
therefore teach me wisdom in my secret heart.

749
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:46,890
Now, the comte was no fool.

750
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:49,850
Though he hoped to redeem Serge...

751
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,900
he knew that
this redemption alone

752
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,230
would not be enough

753
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:55,610
to regain control over the village.

754
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:58,650
He understood
that some larger lesson

755
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,320
needed to be taught.

756
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,950
Some greater problem

757
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,210
needed to be identified and solved.

758
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:15,750
Little did the comte suspect

759
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,420
that his greater problem

760
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,840
would arrive
one quiet afternoon

761
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,760
in the dull green waters ofthe River Tannes.

762
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:31,060
You're it!

763
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:32,560
Hey, look!

764
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,860
I'm over here!

765
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:51,200
You've never really told me what the problem is...

766
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:53,040
between you and Caroline.

767
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,380
'Cause it's none ofyour damn business.

768
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:00,840
I'm an embarrassment to her.

769
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:07,970
I swear, I... read dirty books.

770
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,720
I eat and drink what I like.

771
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,140
And sin ofsins...

772
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:17,650
I refuse to go to Les Mimosas.

773
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:19,320
When I was a kid...

774
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,280
we used to call it le mortoir.

775
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:26,160
It's a nursing home for old...

776
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,030
It's in Toulouse.

777
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,870
Caroline loves
the thought ofa nurse

778
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:35,500
with a clipboard recording my bowel movements.

779
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:37,790
Mama, Mama, come quick!

780
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,000
They're here! They've come to Lansquent!

781
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:41,380
Slow down, Anouk, who's here?

782
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:43,340
Pirates!

783
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,340
Come on!

784
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:45,510
Why can't we stay?

785
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:46,550
Come on!

786
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,010
But why can't we stay?

787
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,010
Ok, enough.

788
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:53,270
But, Mama,just a little bit.

789
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:54,270
Come on.

790
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,770
Hello. How are you?

791
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,360
Anybody got a sweet tooth?

792
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:23,130
I bet he's the captain.

793
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:28,510
Anouk, don't do that.

794
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:31,220
Anouk, don't do that, please.

795
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:32,640
How do you do?

796
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:33,640
Sorry.

797
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,390
I'd like to apologize.

798
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,350
For all of us.

799
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,520
Sincerely.

800
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,900
What for?

801
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:43,320
Forwhatever it is you're here to accuse us of.

802
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,190
Why would I do that?

803
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,570
Well, because we river rats

804
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:49,910
are the dregs ofsociety.

805
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:52,240
With horrible diseases and criminal impulses.

806
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:55,750
Sounds terrifying.

807
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:56,910
Is it true?

808
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,290
It's what you townspeople always seem to think...

809
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,580
isn't it?

810
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:03,340
This is not my town. Sorry.

811
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:05,920
Well, then, what do you want?

812
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:07,630
Are you here to save us?

813
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,930
Are you the catholic aid society?

814
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:12,350
French Family League? Communist workers?

815
00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:13,930
Which idea are you selling?

816
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:15,430
Chocolate.

817
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,180
I'm sorry, chocolate?

818
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:19,100
What's a river rat?

819
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,020
Is it like a pirate?

820
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:23,560
Yeah, you could say that. Yeah.

821
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:25,570
You could.

822
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:28,110
Have a look at my treasure chest.

823
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:32,450
Let me guess, they're for sale.

824
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:33,950
As a matter offact, they are.

825
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:35,540
For a mere 30 francs apiece.

826
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:38,830
You laugh? I can get 50 for them in Paris.

827
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:41,580
Then go to Paris.

828
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,260
We'll take 2, please.

829
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:52,260
You'll take 2?

830
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:53,850
Yes, please, absolutely.

831
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:55,050
Ok.

832
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:59,180
I don't know if I have the right change.

833
00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:00,230
Just a minute.

834
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:01,980
They're beautiful.

835
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:04,520
Ireland's finest.

836
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:05,690
Thanks.

837
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:07,820
Thankyou. Listen...

838
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:09,990
I should probably warn you.

839
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:12,320
You make friends with us...

840
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:13,820
you'll make enemies ofothers.

841
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:15,740
That a promise?

842
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:20,750
It's a guarantee.

843
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:35,680
What's he up to?

844
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,640
Maybe he'sjoining the circus.

845
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:45,810
Sorry, we're closed!

846
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:02,870
Josephine, you look different.

847
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,540
So do you.

848
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:11,460
I just want to tell you that I am so sorry.

849
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:14,220
For everything.

850
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:16,220
But I've changed.

851
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:19,600
You see, God has made me a new man.

852
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:25,060
I askyou, I... I beg you...

853
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,610
please accept my apology.

854
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,620
I accept.

855
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:46,080
I promise, from now on...

856
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:47,830
everything will be different.

857
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:52,710
Everything already is different, Serge.

858
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,220
Yeah.

859
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,720
Well, I mean, when you come home.

860
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,390
Home?

861
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:05,390
Thanks for the apology.
The flowers are... lovely.

862
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,520
No, please don't,Josephine.

863
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:10,270
We are still married in the eyes ofGod.

864
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,860
Then he must be blind.

865
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:22,330
The council has no legal authority

866
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:23,950
to force them to move.

867
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:26,830
The riverbank is public land.

868
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:33,750
The mayor wishes to say a few words.

869
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,090
If I may...

870
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:36,880
ladies and gentlemen ofthe council.

871
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,760
These people are...

872
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:43,010
rootless, Godless drifters.

873
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:44,890
That's right!

874
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,890
Theirs is the way ofslovenly pleasure.

875
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:48,310
Yes.

876
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,480
They would contaminate
the spirit ofour quiet town.

877
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:55,780
The innocence ofour children.

878
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:58,530
Now, the chairman ofthe council is quite right.

879
00:58:58,610 --> 00:59:00,820
We cannot force them to leave.

880
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:03,330
Why not?

881
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:06,500
But we can help them to understand...

882
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:08,540
that they are not welcome.

883
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:17,590
Josephine?

884
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:24,850
Josephine, you think
you can just walk out on me?

885
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:26,810
You stupid woman!

886
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:30,350
You're nothing without me.

887
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,560
You can't even use a skillet!

888
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:36,820
Can't even put a...

889
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:37,820
goddamn meal on the table.

890
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:39,240
He's inside.

891
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:40,700
He's here.

892
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:41,860
Oh, God.

893
00:59:41,950 --> 00:59:43,450
I need to talk to you.

894
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,910
Please open the door. I know—

895
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,250
Mama!

896
00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:49,370
Come help me!

897
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:53,960
Open the door.

898
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,500
I just want to talk to you.

899
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:57,380
Go sleep it off, Serge!

900
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:59,880
You shut up, you bitch!

901
00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:02,890
You've caused enough trouble already!

902
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:03,930
You—

903
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:07,640
Open this door!

904
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:08,890
Mama!

905
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:12,480
- Oh, my God!
- You st—

906
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:16,360
Stay away from me.

907
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:21,320
Come here now!

908
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:26,530
Why, you meddling bitch!

909
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:33,620
You—

910
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:49,640
Who says I can't use a skillet?

911
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:02,700
Bonjour, monsieur.

912
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:10,750
Bonjour.

913
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:16,790
Wonderful.

914
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:17,790
Come on.

915
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,710
Up. Come on.

916
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:20,880
Up.

917
01:01:22,050 --> 01:01:23,970
Come on.

918
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,640
His skull can't be as thick as we thought.

919
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:34,020
It was like swatting a fly.

920
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:41,820
The worst is over.

921
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:43,940
He found out what you're made of.

922
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:45,950
So did I.

923
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,370
- Hi.
- Hey.

924
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,290
How long have we got?

925
01:01:55,370 --> 01:01:57,210
She's at the hairdresser for an hour.

926
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,340
Fuffi?

927
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:01,750
Fuffi.

928
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:03,760
I'm so sorry, but I have
to break the appointment.

929
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:04,800
Is something wrong?

930
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,340
No. I volunteered to distribute these.

931
01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:07,590
I promised the comte
I'd have them out

932
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,430
by the end ofthe day.

933
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:11,510
Count me in.

934
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,310
Not that I expect
any ofthem to stop by

935
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:14,390
for a hairstyle.

936
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,600
It's notjust that.

937
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:16,980
The comte feels we must stand firm.

938
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:19,190
We cannot trust these people.

939
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:21,520
Before you know it, they'll
be doingjobs for food.

940
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:22,610
They'll be begging at our doors.

941
01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:24,530
Not at this door.

942
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:27,110
Good, Fuffi, good.

943
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:31,030
Rub, rub, rub. Rub harder. Rub.

944
01:02:32,450 --> 01:02:34,250
Rub. Rub.

945
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:39,000
Rub it. Hard.

946
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:41,000
Keep your head still.

947
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:45,010
Bravo!

948
01:02:53,930 --> 01:02:55,680
Hello, Caroline.

949
01:03:01,690 --> 01:03:03,480
Ifyou want to blame someone, blame me—

950
01:03:03,570 --> 01:03:05,650
Corrupting him with cocoa.

951
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:07,820
Oh, how dare you, Mother.

952
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:10,570
He's happy. He's fine. Look at him.

953
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:11,740
Mama, I—

954
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:13,910
Well, what about you, Mother?

955
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:16,250
Are you fine?

956
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:21,000
I bet she has conveniently
forgotten to tell you.

957
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:22,000
Carol.

958
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:23,420
Why don't you show them, Mother?

959
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:26,010
Are you afraid to? Why don't you show?

960
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:34,890
Insulin shots.

961
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:37,100
She has diabetes- very advanced.

962
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:39,230
She could be blind within a year.

963
01:03:39,310 --> 01:03:41,400
Yeah. Couldn't you call me a drug addict?

964
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:43,480
It sounds a lot more glamorous.

965
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:45,150
And you—

966
01:03:45,230 --> 01:03:46,730
You sit here feeding her sweets.

967
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:49,780
There are worse ways to die.

968
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:51,780
Why don't you just give her rat poison?

969
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:53,120
It would be faster.

970
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,280
Carol has a flair for drama.

971
01:03:55,370 --> 01:03:56,910
She needs to be in a place

972
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,660
where she can be taken care of.

973
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:01,210
Le mortoir?

974
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:03,210
I'd rather be in hell.

975
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:08,050
You may get there, Mother.

976
01:04:08,130 --> 01:04:09,420
Luc, come with me.

977
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:10,760
I don't want to.

978
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:12,050
He's-

979
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:13,890
He's happy here. It's good for him.

980
01:04:14,970 --> 01:04:17,060
I will decide what is good for my son...

981
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:18,560
Madame Muscat.

982
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,490
Give me another.

983
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:32,700
It's my life. Let me enjoy what's left of it.

984
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:33,700
Fill 'er up.

985
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:36,370
Armande, why didn't you tell me?

986
01:04:36,450 --> 01:04:40,910
Is this a chocolaterie, or is it a confessional?

987
01:04:44,290 --> 01:04:46,750
Don't you dare pity me.

988
01:05:12,990 --> 01:05:14,950
Sorry, we're closed.

989
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:18,330
Shejust wants a soda water.

990
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:22,500
I don't serve animals.

991
01:05:30,170 --> 01:05:31,300
Right.

992
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:49,980
Hello.

993
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:50,980
Hi.

994
01:05:51,070 --> 01:05:52,610
I just made a fresh batch of monduon.

995
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:54,700
Anybody interested?

996
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:56,360
My tummy hurts.

997
01:05:57,490 --> 01:05:59,490
I've gotjust the thing for that. Come in.

998
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:02,200
What about boycotting immorality, then?

999
01:06:03,370 --> 01:06:05,250
Come in.

1000
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:11,500
An old remedy.

1001
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:14,090
From the cocoa tree.

1002
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:15,670
Tastes strange.

1003
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,760
Maybe your daddy would like a taste.

1004
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:20,850
He's not my daddy. He's my pony.

1005
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,770
Here. It's a lot better than those leaves.

1006
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:28,770
Tastes good.

1007
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:30,270
Come on.

1008
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:32,650
Pantoufle wants to meet you.

1009
01:06:32,730 --> 01:06:34,990
He's my kangaroo.

1010
01:06:40,370 --> 01:06:42,950
Go ahead. It's your favorite.

1011
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:48,120
What makes you so sure?

1012
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:49,960
Go on. Taste it.

1013
01:06:56,550 --> 01:06:57,470
That's fantastic.

1014
01:06:57,550 --> 01:06:58,800
Oh, thanks.

1015
01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:00,390
I have a knack for guessing.

1016
01:07:00,470 --> 01:07:02,970
It's good— not my favorite.

1017
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:04,010
Sorry?

1018
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:10,150
All right.

1019
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:11,980
Thanks very much.

1020
01:07:18,570 --> 01:07:20,610
You know, I could fix that, ifyou like.

1021
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:22,620
Not with glass, but...

1022
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:24,280
I can make you a nice strong one out ofwood.

1023
01:07:24,370 --> 01:07:26,160
That's nice ofyou...

1024
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:28,750
but I insist on paying you foryour work.

1025
01:07:28,830 --> 01:07:31,670
Well, that makes 2 of us, then.

1026
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:34,920
Bye.

1027
01:07:36,170 --> 01:07:37,590
Thanks again.

1028
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:44,430
She's laughing at us.

1029
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:47,810
Now she's got one
ofthose river people

1030
01:07:47,890 --> 01:07:49,230
working for her.

1031
01:07:49,310 --> 01:07:50,230
Is that a problem?

1032
01:07:50,310 --> 01:07:51,810
After all, Christ teaches us—

1033
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:52,810
Look at this.

1034
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:55,480
She's soliciting for stalls

1035
01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:56,780
and street performers

1036
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:58,190
for a fertility celebration

1037
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:00,150
on Easter Sunday.

1038
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,070
She's cackling at us.

1039
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:03,320
When are you going to do something about it?

1040
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:05,450
Oh, there.

1041
01:08:08,410 --> 01:08:09,500
What part ofAustralia

1042
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:10,830
is Pantoufle from?

1043
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:11,920
A small town

1044
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,460
outside ofSydney.

1045
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,710
What does he eat?

1046
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,460
Leaves...

1047
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:19,590
bugs...

1048
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:21,930
and worms, ofcourse.

1049
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:23,970
What about chocolate?

1050
01:08:24,050 --> 01:08:26,310
Kangaroos don't eat chocolate.

1051
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:27,970
Has he ever tried it?

1052
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:33,520
Have you ever tried chocolate?

1053
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:35,270
He's not interested.

1054
01:08:36,150 --> 01:08:37,070
Not interested?

1055
01:08:37,150 --> 01:08:39,530
Mr. Pantoufle, you surprise me.

1056
01:08:39,610 --> 01:08:41,030
A world traveler
such as yourself

1057
01:08:41,110 --> 01:08:42,610
not interested in new flavors?

1058
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:44,110
You should be ashamed.

1059
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,580
I have a very nice truffle here

1060
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:48,740
if he wants to try it.

1061
01:08:48,830 --> 01:08:50,750
You are wasting your time.

1062
01:08:50,830 --> 01:08:52,620
Oh, I'm sorry.

1063
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:55,920
How do you know
you don't like chocolate

1064
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,460
ifyou refuse to try it?

1065
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:58,630
Do you like worms?

1066
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:01,760
What?

1067
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,680
How do you know ifyou've never tasted one?

1068
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:27,320
Subtle.

1069
01:09:29,330 --> 01:09:30,240
Zesty.

1070
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:34,580
Disgusting.

1071
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:43,880
Go on, my little friend.

1072
01:09:43,970 --> 01:09:45,130
Be free.

1073
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:46,800
You tricked me.

1074
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:49,220
Satan...

1075
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:51,220
wears many guises.

1076
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:56,100
At times, Satan is
the singer ofa lurid song

1077
01:09:56,190 --> 01:09:58,310
you hear on the radio.

1078
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:00,570
At times...

1079
01:10:00,650 --> 01:10:03,110
the author ofa salacious novel.

1080
01:10:03,190 --> 01:10:06,780
At times, the quiet man
lurking in the schoolyard

1081
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:08,490
asking your children

1082
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:11,660
if he mightjoin their game.

1083
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:13,200
And at times...

1084
01:10:13,290 --> 01:10:15,960
the maker ofsweet things-

1085
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:18,420
mere trifles.

1086
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:20,500
Forwhat could seem more harmless...

1087
01:10:20,590 --> 01:10:22,250
more innocent...

1088
01:10:23,170 --> 01:10:24,630
than chocolate?

1089
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:31,510
A bit ofa squeak.

1090
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:35,520
Hey...

1091
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,190
Guillaume!

1092
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:38,310
I've got something new

1093
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,480
Charlie's going to love.

1094
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:45,940
Come on, Charlie. Come on.

1095
01:10:47,570 --> 01:10:49,030
It's me. I should go.

1096
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,280
No, it's not you. It's-

1097
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,290
Where have you been?

1098
01:10:54,370 --> 01:10:55,700
I was worried.

1099
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:57,370
Hey! I'm talking to you.

1100
01:10:57,460 --> 01:11:00,330
It'sjust like all the other towns.

1101
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:06,670
Anouk.

1102
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:08,260
Just tell me what happened.

1103
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:10,300
Are you Satan's helper?

1104
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:16,430
Well, it's not easy being different.

1105
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:20,190
Why can't we go to church?

1106
01:11:20,270 --> 01:11:22,480
Well, you can ifyou want...

1107
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:24,360
but it won't make things easier.

1108
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,280
Why can't you wear black shoes

1109
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:28,280
like the other mothers?

1110
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:34,580
He's a fine piece ofwork...

1111
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:36,830
our little nobleman.

1112
01:11:36,910 --> 01:11:39,160
No wonder his wife goes gallivanting off.

1113
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:40,170
She's been in Italy for months.

1114
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:41,000
Did you know that?

1115
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:44,130
Armande...

1116
01:11:44,210 --> 01:11:46,420
the whole town's against me.

1117
01:11:47,510 --> 01:11:49,760
What can I do?

1118
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,470
Throw me a party.

1119
01:11:52,510 --> 01:11:54,100
What?

1120
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:56,810
Wednesday's my 70th.

1121
01:11:56,890 --> 01:11:58,100
Let's show the bastards

1122
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:00,850
we're ready to go down dancing.

1123
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:05,190
Well...

1124
01:12:05,270 --> 01:12:06,690
but a party?

1125
01:12:09,570 --> 01:12:11,280
You're not well. You have to face it.

1126
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:14,830
Ok, ok, ok...

1127
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:17,790
But you do this for me,
and I promise

1128
01:12:17,870 --> 01:12:19,580
I'll check into le mortoir
the very next morning

1129
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:22,210
without a care in the world.

1130
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:28,550
If I threw a party in this town...

1131
01:12:28,630 --> 01:12:30,220
no one would come.

1132
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:34,680
They don't need to know who's throwing it.

1133
01:12:36,010 --> 01:12:37,260
Armande, listen, I—

1134
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:39,770
No, no, no. You listen.

1135
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:43,440
I need this.

1136
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:53,950
When I need help, I ask for it.

1137
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:15,760
Boys, bring me some more wood.

1138
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:28,020
My mother
used to sing that song

1139
01:13:28,110 --> 01:13:30,780
when I couldn't sleep.

1140
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:32,530
And did it help?

1141
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:39,620
I still didn't sleep, but, yes, yes, it helped.

1142
01:13:42,290 --> 01:13:44,210
How's the door?

1143
01:13:44,290 --> 01:13:46,040
It squeaks.

1144
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:47,210
Does it?

1145
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:50,460
How's Anouk? Is she well?

1146
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:52,260
Oh, she's better. She's fine.

1147
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:54,300
Good. How are you?

1148
01:13:56,050 --> 01:13:58,220
I'm throwing a party...

1149
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:00,600
ifanyone shows up.

1150
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:01,680
Thanks.

1151
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:05,730
Who's invited?

1152
01:14:05,810 --> 01:14:07,730
A bunch oftownspeople.

1153
01:14:09,190 --> 01:14:11,440
Tell me something.
Why do you give a damn about

1154
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:13,490
what these narrow-minded villagers think?

1155
01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:18,070
You're not scared ofthem, are you?

1156
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:20,990
Coming to the party or not?

1157
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:24,330
I can't.

1158
01:14:24,410 --> 01:14:26,540
There's a boycott against immorality...

1159
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:28,630
and I must respect that.

1160
01:14:28,710 --> 01:14:30,630
That is a problem.

1161
01:14:30,710 --> 01:14:32,920
Well, then, I'll leave you
with this test

1162
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:34,880
ofyour convictions.

1163
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:35,880
What is that?

1164
01:14:35,970 --> 01:14:38,260
Your favorite.

1165
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:39,550
My favorite?

1166
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:41,680
Is that right?

1167
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,600
- Thankyou.
- You're welcome.

1168
01:14:52,230 --> 01:14:53,940
I'm undone—

1169
01:14:54,030 --> 01:14:56,190
But not my favorite.

1170
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:04,160
I'll come round sometime...

1171
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,790
get that squeak out ofyour door.

1172
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:27,200
A lot foryou.

1173
01:16:28,290 --> 01:16:30,040
You see?

1174
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:43,970
Bon appetit, everyonee

1175
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:02,320
Ifthe comte finds out...

1176
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:04,990
The comte isn't here. He wasn't invited.

1177
01:17:06,870 --> 01:17:07,830
Is Luc coming?

1178
01:17:11,330 --> 01:17:13,830
I'm sure they have other plans.

1179
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,750
Luc?

1180
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:19,340
Why are you sleeping?

1181
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:30,180
Are you not feeling well?

1182
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:49,330
Happy birthday, Grandmama.

1183
01:17:52,910 --> 01:17:55,460
The invitation said 5:00.

1184
01:17:55,540 --> 01:17:58,840
I should have read it more closely.

1185
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:00,090
Ifyou had, you'd know

1186
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:03,970
there was supposed to be no gifts.

1187
01:18:04,050 --> 01:18:06,680
Don't worry so much about the "supposed to."

1188
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,220
Like it?

1189
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:23,150
You made me younger.

1190
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,650
Very diplomatic.

1191
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:19,580
I have 2 announcements.

1192
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:23,670
Number one- ifyou like what you tasted here...

1193
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:25,880
you're going to love
my chocolate festival

1194
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:27,050
on Sunday.

1195
01:19:27,130 --> 01:19:29,880
Advertise on your own time.

1196
01:19:29,970 --> 01:19:31,760
What's for dessert?

1197
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:34,510
That brings me to number 2.

1198
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:36,930
It is my duty to announce

1199
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:39,520
that there is no dessert here tonight.

1200
01:19:40,690 --> 01:19:42,230
No dessert?

1201
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:44,940
Because it's on Roux's boat.

1202
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:50,530
Any complaints, see me.

1203
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:12,820
Monsieur le Comte?

1204
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:14,160
Who's there?

1205
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:17,410
I must speak to you.

1206
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:34,050
You see, Monsieur le Comte?

1207
01:21:34,130 --> 01:21:35,510
You see?

1208
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:38,220
There'sJosephine, that stupid cow.

1209
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:44,190
Something must be done, Serge.

1210
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,520
Something must be done.

1211
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:18,550
You done yet?

1212
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:20,390
Almost.

1213
01:22:20,470 --> 01:22:21,600
Almost?

1214
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,890
Come on, leave it. You're done.

1215
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:27,440
Come with me.

1216
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:30,480
Come on.

1217
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:35,530
I have chocolates...

1218
01:22:35,610 --> 01:22:36,570
Chocolate everywhere.

1219
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:37,780
What? You're all right.

1220
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:46,160
Do you think everyone had a good time?

1221
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:56,320
I'm tired.

1222
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:59,240
Vianne, Roux.

1223
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:02,660
Thanks.

1224
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:05,160
This was...

1225
01:24:07,290 --> 01:24:08,750
Thankyou.

1226
01:24:13,210 --> 01:24:14,750
I'll take you home.

1227
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:18,090
Oh, for God's sake, don't fuss.

1228
01:24:18,170 --> 01:24:20,970
You'll ruin a perfectly decadent evening.

1229
01:24:21,050 --> 01:24:23,090
I'm not partial to big, sloppy good-byes.

1230
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:26,510
Armande.

1231
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:38,070
I'll take care ofthe dishes.

1232
01:24:38,150 --> 01:24:41,900
I think I'll sleep in my chair tonight.

1233
01:25:21,650 --> 01:25:22,610
Do you like it?

1234
01:25:23,860 --> 01:25:25,570
Taking your home with you

1235
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:27,450
whereveryou go?

1236
01:25:27,530 --> 01:25:29,160
Yeah. Why not?

1237
01:25:30,410 --> 01:25:31,790
Yourway must be harder-

1238
01:25:31,870 --> 01:25:37,290
Each time having to make
a new home from scratch.

1239
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:40,590
Well, maybe this time I'll get it right.

1240
01:25:40,670 --> 01:25:42,300
What do you mean?

1241
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:43,840
Maybe I'll stay.

1242
01:25:46,090 --> 01:25:47,550
What?

1243
01:25:54,020 --> 01:25:56,310
Don't you ever think about

1244
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,730
belonging somewhere?

1245
01:26:00,530 --> 01:26:02,780
The price is too high.

1246
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:05,150
You end up caring what people expect ofyou.

1247
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:06,410
No.

1248
01:26:06,490 --> 01:26:08,450
Is that so terrible?

1249
01:26:09,700 --> 01:26:12,660
Having people expect something ofyou?

1250
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:18,670
How does Anouk feel about it?

1251
01:26:20,630 --> 01:26:21,710
What?

1252
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:23,840
All the moving around.

1253
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:28,090
No, she's fine.

1254
01:26:28,180 --> 01:26:29,470
She handles it beautifully.

1255
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:32,430
She makes friends easily.

1256
01:26:34,430 --> 01:26:36,890
She has such an unusual...

1257
01:26:42,780 --> 01:26:48,360
She hates it.

1258
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,510
Vianne.

1259
01:28:27,590 --> 01:28:29,510
Vianne, come on.

1260
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:32,640
Come on.

1261
01:28:50,490 --> 01:28:52,360
Get 'em out of here!

1262
01:28:54,740 --> 01:28:56,660
We need more! Hurry up!

1263
01:28:56,740 --> 01:28:57,830
Anouk!

1264
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:03,710
Mommy!

1265
01:29:12,220 --> 01:29:13,180
Anouk!

1266
01:29:26,980 --> 01:29:28,230
No!

1267
01:29:30,190 --> 01:29:31,860
Jesus!

1268
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,740
Come back!

1269
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:42,000
Anouk!

1270
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:44,620
Come back, Vianne!

1271
01:29:47,790 --> 01:29:49,250
Anouk!

1272
01:29:53,130 --> 01:29:54,180
- Stop!
- No!

1273
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:55,220
No!

1274
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:56,590
- No!
- Stop it!

1275
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:59,510
Stop it!

1276
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:00,680
- Come back!
- No!

1277
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:17,200
No!

1278
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:19,780
Come on!

1279
01:30:48,310 --> 01:30:50,480
Why did you stop me?

1280
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:52,190
It was too late.

1281
01:30:55,490 --> 01:30:57,150
Mom!

1282
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:03,740
There she is.

1283
01:31:03,830 --> 01:31:05,370
Oh, my God, there she is!

1284
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:06,580
Mama!

1285
01:31:07,670 --> 01:31:09,080
Anouska!

1286
01:31:09,170 --> 01:31:10,080
I'm coming!

1287
01:31:10,170 --> 01:31:12,130
Oh, my God.

1288
01:31:17,130 --> 01:31:18,550
You're hurting me.

1289
01:31:28,310 --> 01:31:30,230
Oh, my God.

1290
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:32,120
I just wanted to make sure that...

1291
01:32:32,210 --> 01:32:33,670
Yes, we're ok.

1292
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:36,800
You?

1293
01:32:41,010 --> 01:32:42,890
And I...

1294
01:32:42,970 --> 01:32:44,260
came to say...

1295
01:32:44,350 --> 01:32:47,770
To say good-bye. Yes, I know.

1296
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:54,770
What?

1297
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:57,440
Your boat.

1298
01:32:59,820 --> 01:33:01,530
You've lost your home.

1299
01:33:03,030 --> 01:33:04,110
No.

1300
01:33:05,370 --> 01:33:08,120
Just a way to get from place to place, really.

1301
01:33:11,620 --> 01:33:13,000
So, how will you...

1302
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:14,920
I'll manage.

1303
01:33:26,430 --> 01:33:34,560
Well...

1304
01:33:38,020 --> 01:33:39,150
Vianne...

1305
01:33:41,860 --> 01:33:43,530
Listen, I...

1306
01:33:43,610 --> 01:33:45,570
I know. I'm sorry.

1307
01:33:48,330 --> 01:33:49,790
I'm sorry.

1308
01:34:03,510 --> 01:34:05,260
Your papa

1309
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:09,140
used to ride this bike every single morning.

1310
01:34:09,220 --> 01:34:11,220
He would have wanted you to have it.

1311
01:34:11,310 --> 01:34:13,100
Just you promise me

1312
01:34:13,180 --> 01:34:14,940
that you'll never run away again, ok?

1313
01:34:15,020 --> 01:34:16,480
Mama, she...

1314
01:34:17,900 --> 01:34:18,860
What?

1315
01:34:20,190 --> 01:34:22,400
What's wrong, Luc?

1316
01:34:27,370 --> 01:34:28,620
Though we cannot know

1317
01:34:28,700 --> 01:34:30,870
Armande Voizin's last thoughts...

1318
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:33,250
we can hope they were thoughts

1319
01:34:33,330 --> 01:34:35,660
of penitence.

1320
01:34:37,210 --> 01:34:38,290
We can hope
she asked God

1321
01:34:38,380 --> 01:34:41,550
to forgive the self-indulgence

1322
01:34:41,630 --> 01:34:43,170
that aggravated her illness

1323
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:44,800
and caused her death...

1324
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:48,220
And we can pause to reexamine our own lives.

1325
01:34:50,010 --> 01:34:51,310
We can resist those

1326
01:34:51,390 --> 01:34:54,480
who would lead us into temptation.

1327
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:09,110
Blessed is the one who endures temptation...

1328
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:10,740
forwhen he has stood the test...

1329
01:35:32,430 --> 01:35:34,260
Mama...

1330
01:35:34,350 --> 01:35:37,230
can we go home now?

1331
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:03,250
Ofcourse.

1332
01:36:07,380 --> 01:36:09,300
Whateveryou like, Mama.

1333
01:36:10,510 --> 01:36:11,970
Vianne, did you want me

1334
01:36:12,050 --> 01:36:15,060
to start the knish for the festival?

1335
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:17,520
Vianne?

1336
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:18,520
Did you—

1337
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:22,860
What are you doing?

1338
01:36:22,940 --> 01:36:24,820
Leaving.

1339
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:26,150
First thing in the morning.

1340
01:36:39,830 --> 01:36:41,580
Is it because ofArmande?

1341
01:36:41,670 --> 01:36:43,500
It was not your fault.

1342
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:47,210
It's time, that's all.

1343
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:49,170
This is who I am.

1344
01:36:58,060 --> 01:37:00,270
Did you believe anything you told me?

1345
01:37:02,150 --> 01:37:04,310
Did you believe I could be better?

1346
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:07,520
Was it all a joke?

1347
01:37:17,450 --> 01:37:19,120
I have to pack now.

1348
01:37:23,370 --> 01:37:25,080
Ifyou leave,
everything will go back

1349
01:37:25,170 --> 01:37:27,040
to the way it always was.

1350
01:37:27,130 --> 01:37:29,550
It is the way it always was.

1351
01:37:32,260 --> 01:37:34,220
Not for me.

1352
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:41,810
I know howyou feel.

1353
01:37:41,890 --> 01:37:43,560
Beg your pardon?

1354
01:37:45,270 --> 01:37:49,270
I suppose it can't be easy

1355
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:50,610
having her gone.

1356
01:37:53,950 --> 01:37:55,490
Can't seem to get used to it...

1357
01:37:55,570 --> 01:37:57,240
no matter how much time.

1358
01:38:01,580 --> 01:38:04,160
But I...

1359
01:38:04,250 --> 01:38:06,540
look forward to her return.

1360
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:14,090
I don't believe anyone
would think less ofyou...

1361
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:18,760
Ifyou were to say she was never coming back.

1362
01:38:22,350 --> 01:38:24,140
Good night, Paul.

1363
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:38,570
Caroline!

1364
01:38:40,450 --> 01:38:41,540
I'm sorry.

1365
01:38:44,330 --> 01:38:46,290
I need to talk to you.

1366
01:38:54,170 --> 01:38:55,130
Come in.

1367
01:38:56,510 --> 01:38:57,800
Monsieur Comte.

1368
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:00,550
It's all right.

1369
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:06,270
Sorry to botheryou, Monsieur le Comte.

1370
01:39:06,350 --> 01:39:07,310
All right.

1371
01:39:10,860 --> 01:39:13,150
It was the right thing to do, wasn't it?

1372
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:17,400
Ofcourse it was. I know it was.

1373
01:39:17,490 --> 01:39:20,570
It's everything with Josephine.

1374
01:39:20,660 --> 01:39:21,580
Serge...

1375
01:39:21,660 --> 01:39:22,580
This...

1376
01:39:22,660 --> 01:39:23,870
What are you talking about?

1377
01:39:23,950 --> 01:39:25,120
The fire, Monsieur le Comte.

1378
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:27,120
I know it was the right thing to do...

1379
01:39:27,210 --> 01:39:30,380
but I can't get rid of

1380
01:39:30,460 --> 01:39:32,590
the faces and the screams.

1381
01:39:32,670 --> 01:39:34,130
The fire...

1382
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:38,180
The fire was an act ofGod.

1383
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:42,140
It was me, Monsieur le Comte.

1384
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:46,310
What?

1385
01:39:46,390 --> 01:39:48,600
You told me.

1386
01:39:48,690 --> 01:39:51,310
Remember?

1387
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:54,820
You said, "Something has to be done, Serge."

1388
01:39:57,490 --> 01:39:59,200
You did, didn't you?

1389
01:40:07,460 --> 01:40:08,870
People could have died.

1390
01:40:10,250 --> 01:40:13,130
You want their blood on your hands?

1391
01:40:13,210 --> 01:40:15,500
On my hands?

1392
01:40:16,710 --> 01:40:20,180
Should I go to Père Henri
and ask for forgiveness?

1393
01:40:22,050 --> 01:40:23,680
Listen to me, Serge.

1394
01:40:25,140 --> 01:40:27,100
Listen very carefully.

1395
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:31,140
You must leave this village at once...

1396
01:40:33,060 --> 01:40:34,820
and never return.

1397
01:40:34,900 --> 01:40:38,320
Why would I leave my home and my café?

1398
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:40,320
Because I'm evicting you, that's why!

1399
01:40:41,780 --> 01:40:44,030
What you have done puts
you beyond anyone's help...

1400
01:40:44,120 --> 01:40:46,370
beyond my help, anybody's help!

1401
01:40:46,450 --> 01:40:48,250
Now get out!

1402
01:40:48,330 --> 01:40:50,160
Unless you will tell
the police what you've done!

1403
01:40:50,250 --> 01:40:52,580
Get out! Get out! Get out!

1404
01:41:11,770 --> 01:41:13,440
Time to go.

1405
01:41:15,900 --> 01:41:17,480
Oh, no.

1406
01:41:17,570 --> 01:41:18,480
I'm not going.

1407
01:41:18,570 --> 01:41:20,070
Well, it's hard for me, too.

1408
01:41:20,150 --> 01:41:21,360
Pantoufle hates this.

1409
01:41:21,450 --> 01:41:22,360
Stop that.

1410
01:41:22,450 --> 01:41:23,700
Please put it on.

1411
01:41:23,780 --> 01:41:24,950
I hate you.

1412
01:41:25,990 --> 01:41:29,870
You're entitled. I said put it on.

1413
01:41:33,290 --> 01:41:34,330
Ouch!

1414
01:41:34,420 --> 01:41:35,540
Well, then, do it yourself!

1415
01:41:35,630 --> 01:41:36,540
I can't!

1416
01:41:36,630 --> 01:41:38,500
Get up.

1417
01:41:38,590 --> 01:41:40,550
I have a bad leg like Pantoufle.

1418
01:41:40,630 --> 01:41:41,880
Stop that. Get up.

1419
01:41:41,970 --> 01:41:44,890
Pantoufle can't walk. I can't walk.

1420
01:41:44,970 --> 01:41:46,220
Walk. Walk!

1421
01:41:46,300 --> 01:41:47,220
You're hurting me.

1422
01:41:47,310 --> 01:41:48,470
Well, stop being...

1423
01:41:55,310 --> 01:41:56,980
Let me go!

1424
01:41:58,020 --> 01:42:00,280
No!

1425
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:02,070
It's not fair!

1426
01:42:02,150 --> 01:42:03,240
Stop it!

1427
01:42:04,410 --> 01:42:05,530
I'm not going!

1428
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:06,950
It's- Stop it!

1429
01:42:26,050 --> 01:42:27,890
I'm sorry, Mama.

1430
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:30,010
I'm sorry.

1431
01:42:33,810 --> 01:42:35,390
Don't worry, Mama.

1432
01:42:45,860 --> 01:42:48,490
The next town will be better...

1433
01:42:48,570 --> 01:42:50,200
won't it, Mama?

1434
01:42:52,910 --> 01:42:54,620
It will.

1435
01:42:54,710 --> 01:42:56,290
It will be wonderful.

1436
01:42:58,790 --> 01:43:01,250
I'm ready to go now, ok?

1437
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:43,500
Is this right?

1438
01:43:43,590 --> 01:43:46,840
No, no, you've got to cut
on the corners like this.

1439
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:48,260
So,just stop them.

1440
01:43:51,470 --> 01:43:52,430
Higher.

1441
01:44:07,490 --> 01:44:09,450
How do you like these almonds?

1442
01:44:13,450 --> 01:44:15,370
Are they chopped fine enough?

1443
01:44:22,290 --> 01:44:23,920
Are they ok, Vianne?

1444
01:44:38,810 --> 01:44:40,560
Christ is risen.

1445
01:44:40,650 --> 01:44:42,400
My friends, let this Easter day

1446
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:44,400
be for us, too, a rebirth.

1447
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:45,570
Let us strive—

1448
01:44:45,650 --> 01:44:48,030
No, no, no.

1449
01:44:48,110 --> 01:44:50,030
No, don't bury the word "rebirth."

1450
01:44:50,110 --> 01:44:51,860
Let it ring out.

1451
01:44:51,950 --> 01:44:54,570
Let this day be for us, too, a rebirth!

1452
01:44:54,660 --> 01:44:55,910
You see, we are extolling

1453
01:44:55,990 --> 01:44:58,410
our parishioners to resurrect

1454
01:44:58,500 --> 01:44:59,960
their moral awareness.

1455
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:02,250
Ok, good, good. Try again.

1456
01:45:02,330 --> 01:45:03,880
I think we've gone over this enough.

1457
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:04,880
Let's call it a day.

1458
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:05,880
What?

1459
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:06,880
I'm very tired.

1460
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:08,000
Fine, fine. Well, leave it with me.

1461
01:45:08,090 --> 01:45:09,130
I may have one or two suggestions.

1462
01:45:09,220 --> 01:45:10,130
Thankyou, Monsieur le Comte—

1463
01:45:10,220 --> 01:45:11,470
Just a couple ofsuggestions.

1464
01:45:11,550 --> 01:45:12,840
A revision here and there.

1465
01:45:12,930 --> 01:45:15,100
I mean, we want it
to be perfect

1466
01:45:15,180 --> 01:45:17,350
tomorrow, don't we?

1467
01:45:17,430 --> 01:45:19,140
- Yes.
- Yes.

1468
01:45:24,190 --> 01:45:25,980
We must resist—

1469
01:45:26,070 --> 01:45:28,780
We must resist the shallow,
worldly temptations

1470
01:45:28,860 --> 01:45:29,900
ofour mortal— No, no.

1471
01:45:29,990 --> 01:45:33,450
We must renounce shallow,
worldly temptations

1472
01:45:33,530 --> 01:45:34,570
ofour mortal flesh.

1473
01:45:41,710 --> 01:45:43,000
Caroline.

1474
01:45:48,710 --> 01:45:51,590
All my efforts have been for nothing.

1475
01:45:51,670 --> 01:45:54,800
I've suffered willingly.

1476
01:45:54,890 --> 01:45:56,640
I've fasted.

1477
01:45:56,720 --> 01:45:59,060
I've hardly eaten for weeks now.

1478
01:45:59,140 --> 01:46:00,390
I'm sorry.

1479
01:46:02,140 --> 01:46:04,270
I'm sorry, my suffering is nothing.

1480
01:46:04,350 --> 01:46:08,310
It'sjust that I feel so lost.

1481
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:10,360
I don't know what to do.

1482
01:46:12,570 --> 01:46:14,490
Tell me what to do.

1483
01:49:43,030 --> 01:49:53,210
Drink this.

1484
01:49:53,290 --> 01:49:54,620
It'll refresh you.

1485
01:49:54,710 --> 01:49:55,830
I promise.

1486
01:49:56,920 --> 01:49:58,250
Go ahead, drink.

1487
01:50:10,890 --> 01:50:12,350
I'm so sorry.

1488
01:50:13,890 --> 01:50:16,770
I won't tell a soul.

1489
01:50:20,360 --> 01:50:22,860
Better get cleaned up.

1490
01:50:22,950 --> 01:50:24,860
Easter Sunday.

1491
01:50:26,120 --> 01:50:27,530
The sermon.

1492
01:50:32,330 --> 01:50:34,370
I didn't finish it.

1493
01:50:35,500 --> 01:50:37,130
I'll think ofsomething.

1494
01:50:49,970 --> 01:50:51,810
I'm not sure

1495
01:50:51,890 --> 01:50:54,850
what the theme of my homily today ought to be.

1496
01:50:57,980 --> 01:51:00,440
Do I want
to speak ofthe miracle

1497
01:51:00,520 --> 01:51:04,240
ofour Lord's divine transformation?

1498
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:07,110
Not really, no.

1499
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:11,030
I don't want to talk about his divinity.

1500
01:51:13,080 --> 01:51:16,750
I'd rather talk about his humanity.

1501
01:51:16,830 --> 01:51:18,290
I mean, you know...

1502
01:51:18,380 --> 01:51:21,290
how he lived his life here on earth.

1503
01:51:21,380 --> 01:51:23,880
His kindness.

1504
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:26,220
His tolerance.

1505
01:51:26,300 --> 01:51:29,010
Listen, here's what I think.

1506
01:51:29,090 --> 01:51:31,220
I think we can't go around

1507
01:51:31,310 --> 01:51:35,600
measuring our goodness by what we don't do.

1508
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:38,060
By what we deny ourselves...

1509
01:51:38,150 --> 01:51:39,520
what we resist...

1510
01:51:39,610 --> 01:51:41,730
and who we exclude.

1511
01:51:44,070 --> 01:51:46,740
I think we've got
to measure goodness

1512
01:51:46,820 --> 01:51:49,410
by what we embrace...

1513
01:51:49,490 --> 01:51:52,660
what we create...

1514
01:51:52,740 --> 01:51:54,740
and who we include.

1515
01:52:00,750 --> 01:52:02,290
It was certainly not

1516
01:52:02,380 --> 01:52:05,800
the most fiery sermon
Père Henri would ever preach...

1517
01:52:07,670 --> 01:52:09,800
Nor the most eloquent.

1518
01:52:11,510 --> 01:52:13,100
But the parishioners

1519
01:52:13,180 --> 01:52:16,680
felt a new sensation that day.

1520
01:52:16,770 --> 01:52:19,480
A lightening ofthe spirit.

1521
01:52:21,610 --> 01:52:25,150
A freedom from the old tranquilite.

1522
01:52:53,680 --> 01:52:54,800
Fantastic!

1523
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:01,730
Thankyou.

1524
01:53:01,810 --> 01:53:03,400
Even the Comte de Reynaud

1525
01:53:03,480 --> 01:53:06,520
felt strangely...

1526
01:53:06,610 --> 01:53:07,860
released.

1527
01:53:13,320 --> 01:53:15,240
Although, it would take
another 6 months

1528
01:53:15,330 --> 01:53:18,830
before he'd work up the nerve
to ask Caroline out to dinner.

1529
01:53:38,930 --> 01:53:41,430
As forJosephine...

1530
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:45,650
she took over the lease
at the old café

1531
01:53:45,730 --> 01:53:47,480
and gave it a new name.

1532
01:54:03,670 --> 01:54:05,580
But still the clever north wind

1533
01:54:05,670 --> 01:54:07,750
was not satisfied.

1534
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:22,480
The wind spoke to Vianne

1535
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:24,810
oftowns yet to be visited.

1536
01:54:27,020 --> 01:54:30,780
Friends in need, yet to be discovered.

1537
01:54:32,900 --> 01:54:35,860
Battles yet to be fought.

1538
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:44,790
By someone else... next time.

1539
01:54:58,640 --> 01:55:02,350
And so it was,
the north wind grew weary

1540
01:55:02,430 --> 01:55:05,640
and went on its way.

1541
01:55:05,730 --> 01:55:07,980
When summer came to the little village...

1542
01:55:08,060 --> 01:55:12,110
a new breeze from the south blew soft and warm.

1543
01:55:17,490 --> 01:55:19,320
Just needed an adjustment.

1544
01:55:19,410 --> 01:55:20,990
Hope it'll be better now.

1545
01:55:23,200 --> 01:55:24,370
Roux!

1546
01:55:24,450 --> 01:55:26,250
My mother knew Roux's return

1547
01:55:26,330 --> 01:55:29,130
had nothing to do with a silly old door.

1548
01:55:31,960 --> 01:55:33,300
So did I.

1549
01:55:36,380 --> 01:55:38,840
I thought you'd never guess.

1550
01:55:38,930 --> 01:55:40,800
My favorite, hot chocolate.

1551
01:55:43,600 --> 01:55:45,100
I knew that.

1552
01:55:53,980 --> 01:55:55,480
As for Pantoufle?

1553
01:55:58,110 --> 01:56:00,360
Well, his bad leg

1554
01:56:00,450 --> 01:56:03,080
miraculously healed...

1555
01:56:03,160 --> 01:56:06,330
and he hopped off in search of new adventures.

1556
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,080
I didn't miss him.

1556
01:56:12,305 --> 01:56:18,695
