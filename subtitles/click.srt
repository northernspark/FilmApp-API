Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

2
00:01:38,494 --> 00:01:40,553
What was going on there, huh?

3
00:01:40,763 --> 00:01:42,663
We thought
you were sleeping, Daddy.

4
00:01:42,866 --> 00:01:46,131
How can I sleep with two
Twinkie burglars roaming around?

5
00:01:46,336 --> 00:01:48,201
Can we watch
Dragon Tales, please?

6
00:01:48,404 --> 00:01:50,998
Yeah. Why not, why not?

7
00:01:52,675 --> 00:01:54,540
Which one of these
turns on the TV?

8
00:02:09,692 --> 00:02:11,489
Honey, I think you
just opened the garage.

9
00:02:11,694 --> 00:02:13,491
I'm just planning ahead. I know.

10
00:02:15,098 --> 00:02:19,398
- P-yew! Was that a stinky-dink bug?
- Good job.

11
00:02:19,602 --> 00:02:21,365
Whatever happened
to the good old days...

12
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:24,233
...when you pulled the knob
and on came the boob tube?

13
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,102
The O'Doyles got
a universal remote control.

14
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,369
One clicker controls everything.

15
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:32,548
Makes life a lot easier
for old people like you.

16
00:02:33,483 --> 00:02:35,610
Well, whoop-de-do
for the O'Doyles.

17
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:36,785
- Tree house?

18
00:02:36,986 --> 00:02:39,284
I don't know. Ask your father.

19
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:40,751
Ask me what?

20
00:02:40,957 --> 00:02:44,688
Do you think you'll have time
to finish building the tree house ever?

21
00:02:44,894 --> 00:02:48,853
Yeah, Dad. It's kind of been
halfway done for two months now.

22
00:02:49,465 --> 00:02:54,300
All right. I want to, it's just I got a lot
of things going on at work right now.

23
00:02:54,504 --> 00:02:58,804
But as soon as I'm done, I'm on it.
I promise. Hang in there.

24
00:03:00,977 --> 00:03:04,469
Hey, look at Sundance
wrestle his duck.

25
00:03:05,281 --> 00:03:07,215
Oh, no, that's not wrestling.

26
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:11,217
That's something you shouldn't
know about for another 10 to 30 years.

27
00:03:11,421 --> 00:03:13,651
Ten for you. Thirty for you.

28
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,324
Hey, Michael? I'll see you tonight
at the swim meet?

29
00:03:19,529 --> 00:03:21,087
Swim meet.

30
00:03:22,165 --> 00:03:24,463
- I gotta go to that?
- Yes.

31
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:28,797
- I'm kidding you. I'll be there. Okay?
- All right. I love you, Michael.

32
00:03:29,005 --> 00:03:31,132
Forever and ever, babe.

33
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:33,103
Mr. Newman.

34
00:03:33,309 --> 00:03:35,334
Kevin O'Doyle.
Yeah. Always a pleasure.

35
00:03:35,545 --> 00:03:38,776
What kind of stereo you got
in that blue piece of shit?

36
00:03:38,982 --> 00:03:41,143
You know what?
I never checked, Kevin.

37
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:43,785
Yeah, well, my father's stereo
is a Bose.

38
00:03:43,987 --> 00:03:46,785
Your father's stereo blows?
That's too bad.

39
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:50,517
No! I said... That's not what I said!

40
00:03:50,727 --> 00:03:53,924
His father's stereo blows!

41
00:03:57,233 --> 00:03:59,861
Come on! Pay the man, let's go!

42
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:08,268
- Good morning, Mr. Newman.
- Good morning.

43
00:04:08,478 --> 00:04:09,911
- Good morning, Mr. Newman.
- Hello.

44
00:04:10,113 --> 00:04:12,206
- Good morning, Mr. Newman.
- Hi.

45
00:04:13,216 --> 00:04:15,047
Good morning, Mr. Newman.

46
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:16,912
- Good morning, Mr. Newman.
- Man, Alice...

47
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,317
...I was stuck in traffic for an hour
and a half. When's the meeting?

48
00:04:21,524 --> 00:04:23,651
- It started already.
- What?

49
00:04:24,427 --> 00:04:25,689
Can I go to the bathroom?

50
00:04:25,895 --> 00:04:28,489
Go to the bathroom.
I told you, you don't have to ask me.

51
00:04:35,738 --> 00:04:37,763
Well, the interesting thing,
Prince Habeeboo...

52
00:04:37,974 --> 00:04:40,807
...is that the building codes
in Manhattan will allow us...

53
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,001
- Michael.
- Sorry I'm late, sir.

54
00:04:43,212 --> 00:04:46,340
Some moron in a red Lamborghini
parked in my spot so...

55
00:04:46,549 --> 00:04:49,746
Prince Habeeboo
drive red Lamborghini.

56
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,384
Red Lamborghini?
I meant blue Ferrari.

57
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,354
Is this one of your partners?

58
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:58,584
Actually, Michael
is just an associate.

59
00:04:58,795 --> 00:05:01,093
But he is one of our brightest
young architects.

60
00:05:01,297 --> 00:05:02,264
Thank you.

61
00:05:02,465 --> 00:05:04,490
Walk His Majesty
through our design concept.

62
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,395
With pleasure.

63
00:05:07,203 --> 00:05:09,728
- Prince Haboobee...
- Habeeboo!

64
00:05:10,406 --> 00:05:12,431
Prince Habeeboo.

65
00:05:12,642 --> 00:05:15,133
Habeeboo. I thought I said that.

66
00:05:15,344 --> 00:05:18,006
When Mr. Ammer explained to me
the type of man you are...

67
00:05:18,214 --> 00:05:22,048
...a visionary who prides himself
on originality...

68
00:05:22,251 --> 00:05:27,052
...I said to myself, "Let's smash
the mold and redefine elegance."

69
00:05:27,256 --> 00:05:29,520
So I present to you your restaurant.

70
00:05:29,725 --> 00:05:31,215
Where is... Where's bar?

71
00:05:31,427 --> 00:05:35,090
Bar is... Here's the bar.
Now, the waterfall...

72
00:05:35,298 --> 00:05:36,356
Make bar longer.

73
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,531
Okay. We could cut
into the atrium a little bit.

74
00:05:41,737 --> 00:05:46,265
No atrium. Just make bar longer
for Prince Habeeboo.

75
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:47,443
Really?

76
00:05:49,612 --> 00:05:51,739
- Still itchy?
- You got it.

77
00:05:53,049 --> 00:05:56,314
And put big drain in floor
for wet T-shirt contest.

78
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:58,043
Now, you're kidding me, right?

79
00:05:58,254 --> 00:06:00,279
Boob water's gotta
go someplace, Michael.

80
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,857
Let's just take out the atrium and
run with that and there's your drain.

81
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,552
- God.
- I love it. It is simply awesome.

82
00:06:08,131 --> 00:06:13,091
Yeah. Basically you want me to design
you an Arabian hoochie house?

83
00:06:13,302 --> 00:06:15,770
How dare you compare
Prince Habeeboo's Bikini Hut...

84
00:06:15,972 --> 00:06:17,906
...to this hoochie house?
- This idea's...

85
00:06:18,107 --> 00:06:20,473
...got nothing to do
with hoochies, Michael.

86
00:06:20,676 --> 00:06:22,166
It's like opposite of hoochie.

87
00:06:22,378 --> 00:06:24,175
No disrespect,
Prince Hubbida Hubbida.

88
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,109
- Hubba Bubba.
- Habeeboo!

89
00:06:26,315 --> 00:06:29,409
Habeeboo!
Hubba Bubba is chewing gum.

90
00:06:29,619 --> 00:06:31,052
Prince Habeeboo's
not chewing gum.

91
00:06:31,254 --> 00:06:35,816
Prince Habeeboo, we will...
I will make this happen.

92
00:06:37,593 --> 00:06:38,560
John Ammer's office.

93
00:06:38,761 --> 00:06:41,730
I hope that atrium idea didn't take
too long to configure, Michael.

94
00:06:41,931 --> 00:06:44,695
Oh, there'll be other Junes
in my life, sir.

95
00:06:44,901 --> 00:06:49,463
See that parking garage
over there on 56?

96
00:06:49,772 --> 00:06:54,038
Watsuhita wants to knock it down
and build a luxury hotel.

97
00:06:54,243 --> 00:06:55,767
- You got the commission?
- Not yet.

98
00:06:55,978 --> 00:07:01,041
I just need someone to come up
with a design proposal. Intrigued?

99
00:07:02,952 --> 00:07:04,146
Hell, yes.

100
00:07:04,353 --> 00:07:07,481
I'm Fourth of July-ing with the kids.
When I get back, I'm all over it.

101
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:12,059
Great. Have a great Fourth of July
with the kids. I'll put Swardson on it.

102
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:16,061
No, no. Absolutely not.
L... l... Can't it just wait three days?

103
00:07:16,265 --> 00:07:19,063
These guys are Japanese.
They can't wait for their fish to cook.

104
00:07:21,637 --> 00:07:23,798
I guess I could talk to my wife.

105
00:07:24,006 --> 00:07:26,668
Great. See you later at happy hour
with Prince Habadabee.

106
00:07:27,343 --> 00:07:31,177
My son has a swim meet tonight
that I have to get to s...

107
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,143
I'm just messing with you.
We're good.

108
00:07:38,354 --> 00:07:40,822
Yeah, Ben!

109
00:07:49,098 --> 00:07:53,694
That's my boy! That's my boy!
Kid, you were great!

110
00:07:54,136 --> 00:07:55,660
You're not my dad.

111
00:07:56,606 --> 00:07:59,268
- As far as you know.
- What?

112
00:08:00,643 --> 00:08:02,508
I was just joking.

113
00:08:02,712 --> 00:08:05,772
Is he really my dad?

114
00:08:05,982 --> 00:08:09,315
Come on, come on! Yes, Ben.
Yes, you did it!

115
00:08:09,518 --> 00:08:10,712
Honey, you were so great.

116
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,378
Whoa, what are you, half a dolphin
or something? That was incredible.

117
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,353
You just got here, Dad. I saw you.

118
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,951
What do you mean I just got here?
Why are you saying that?

119
00:08:20,162 --> 00:08:22,130
I saw you. You jumped in there,
you swam here.

120
00:08:22,331 --> 00:08:25,926
- Then what stroke was he doing, Dad?
- He was doing the shut-up.

121
00:08:27,403 --> 00:08:30,804
Hey. Good thing is,
Daddy was here to see you finish.

122
00:08:31,007 --> 00:08:32,031
He didn't see me finish.

123
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:34,471
He was hanging out
with Ping Woo for some reason.

124
00:08:34,677 --> 00:08:37,111
- Yeah, what was that about, huh?
- The kid was drowning.

125
00:08:37,313 --> 00:08:38,439
I'm gonna let him drown?

126
00:08:39,315 --> 00:08:40,942
Nobody goes drowning in my pool.

127
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,710
How you doing? Bill Herlihy.
Ben's coach. You must be Dad.

128
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,581
Michael Speedo...
Michael Newman. Sorry.

129
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:49,751
Big Ben, that was great progress
out there, huh?

130
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:52,792
Just remember, right arm out,
head turns left. Left arm out...

131
00:08:52,995 --> 00:08:55,623
Head turns right. I know.
I just forgot at the end.

132
00:08:55,831 --> 00:08:56,855
Well, that's all right.

133
00:08:57,066 --> 00:09:00,365
You master that, people are gonna
think you're a half a dolphin out there.

134
00:09:00,569 --> 00:09:02,628
- Really?
- Yeah.

135
00:09:03,506 --> 00:09:04,905
Cute.

136
00:09:05,574 --> 00:09:07,735
Hello? Mr. Ammer.

137
00:09:15,851 --> 00:09:18,615
Ben, honey, slow down.
It's not a race.

138
00:09:18,821 --> 00:09:20,516
That's his second one
in five minutes.

139
00:09:20,723 --> 00:09:22,418
Keeps eating more and more.

140
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:25,526
He's like a machine.
He can't still be hungry.

141
00:09:25,728 --> 00:09:29,220
He's not. He's just doing whatever
Michael's doing. It's driving me crazy.

142
00:09:29,432 --> 00:09:33,095
Everything Michael's been doing lately
is very unhealthy for him.

143
00:09:33,302 --> 00:09:35,668
He's gonna kill himself.

144
00:09:36,439 --> 00:09:39,033
Like a signature building
we're talking about.

145
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:40,640
Oh, my God.

146
00:09:42,478 --> 00:09:44,036
Scared the crap out of me.

147
00:09:44,647 --> 00:09:47,013
Dad, how much longer
are you gonna live?

148
00:09:48,017 --> 00:09:50,611
- One minute.
- One minute?

149
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,913
- Daddy's gonna die in one minute!
- Oh, no, honey.

150
00:09:53,122 --> 00:09:54,487
Don't worry. I'm not dying.

151
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:58,558
I'm gonna live for 200 years.
Is that long enough for you and me?

152
00:09:59,128 --> 00:10:02,859
- Promise?
- I promise. Swear. Come here.

153
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,827
You son of a bitch!

154
00:10:06,035 --> 00:10:08,799
Hey! There are families here!

155
00:10:09,004 --> 00:10:11,336
Show some respect,
you pieces of shit!

156
00:10:12,074 --> 00:10:14,838
Go home and watch VH1, old man.

157
00:10:15,044 --> 00:10:17,877
Don't light another damn one!

158
00:10:19,181 --> 00:10:21,706
Benjamin. Benjamin.
What am I holding?

159
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:24,715
A quarter. Now, Grandma
does not let me eat ice cream...

160
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,512
...because of my diabetes.
- True.

161
00:10:26,722 --> 00:10:30,385
But she says nothing, however,
about a tasty quarter.

162
00:10:30,826 --> 00:10:32,088
Okay.

163
00:10:34,296 --> 00:10:35,888
All right. All right.

164
00:10:36,098 --> 00:10:39,829
Very quickly, please, count to three
because it tastes terrible.

165
00:10:40,035 --> 00:10:43,368
One, two, three.

166
00:10:45,007 --> 00:10:46,634
Are you shitting me?

167
00:10:46,842 --> 00:10:49,606
First he's eating like his father,
now you're talking like him?

168
00:10:49,812 --> 00:10:52,178
- Ben.
- Don't you ever say that again.

169
00:10:52,381 --> 00:10:55,714
- Sorry, Grandma.
- How do you do that, Grandpa?

170
00:10:56,085 --> 00:10:58,781
A good magician
never reveals his secrets.

171
00:10:58,988 --> 00:11:01,582
Your daddy has wanted to know
how I've done that trick...

172
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:02,917
...since he was your age.

173
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,524
Isn't that true, son?

174
00:11:04,727 --> 00:11:07,059
Hey, Michael.
Michael, who are you talking to?

175
00:11:07,263 --> 00:11:10,255
Jesus. I'm talking to my boss, Ma.
Take it easy.

176
00:11:10,466 --> 00:11:12,127
Oh, yeah?
Well, tell him to get a life.

177
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:14,564
You got family here.
You're busy. Come on.

178
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,101
My mother says hello.

179
00:11:16,305 --> 00:11:18,535
Oh, he's such a big boy, isn't he?

180
00:11:18,741 --> 00:11:22,074
On his big cell phone. Big boy.

181
00:11:22,278 --> 00:11:27,614
That's it. Get some sleep. Thank you,
Mr. Ammer. All right. Good night.

182
00:11:27,817 --> 00:11:30,251
- Are you done? Can we relax now?
- Sorry.

183
00:11:31,887 --> 00:11:34,321
Eat me, grandpa!

184
00:11:34,757 --> 00:11:35,815
You're dead.

185
00:11:36,492 --> 00:11:39,757
- Oh, shit!
- Yeah, you better run!

186
00:11:39,962 --> 00:11:41,759
I kicked your father's ass
in high school!

187
00:11:41,964 --> 00:11:43,295
Now I'm gonna kick yours!

188
00:11:43,499 --> 00:11:46,229
I hate that man.

189
00:11:46,535 --> 00:11:48,662
Okay, good night, you two cowboys.

190
00:11:48,871 --> 00:11:51,362
- Reach for the sky, Pocahontas.
- No, back to bed.

191
00:11:51,574 --> 00:11:55,169
Come on. Pocahontas is off duty.
I'm out of here.

192
00:11:58,147 --> 00:12:00,342
You getting sick, sheriff?

193
00:12:00,783 --> 00:12:02,842
I don't got time to be sick, so no.

194
00:12:03,052 --> 00:12:05,919
I need to watch this documentary
on Asian architecture.

195
00:12:06,121 --> 00:12:08,851
Well, you gotta get some rest
sometime, sweetheart.

196
00:12:09,058 --> 00:12:11,322
Besides, the woodland creatures
will laugh at you...

197
00:12:11,527 --> 00:12:14,121
...if you collapse trying
to put up the tent this weekend.

198
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:18,758
Yeah. I forgot to tell you.

199
00:12:19,201 --> 00:12:21,294
We gotta postpone
the camping trip.

200
00:12:22,004 --> 00:12:23,869
Ammer put me on a project.

201
00:12:24,073 --> 00:12:26,473
It's due Tuesday. If I don't finish,
I'm off it, so...

202
00:12:26,675 --> 00:12:28,836
The kids have been talking
about camping all year.

203
00:12:29,044 --> 00:12:30,136
Think I don't know that?

204
00:12:30,346 --> 00:12:32,610
It's just every choice I make,
everything I do...

205
00:12:32,815 --> 00:12:34,715
...I disappoint somebody.

206
00:12:34,917 --> 00:12:37,511
Make sure you don't keep
disappointing the wrong people.

207
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,245
I'm not out drinking or gambling
or hitting on chicks.

208
00:12:40,456 --> 00:12:43,220
I'm working my ass off
so my family can have a better life...

209
00:12:43,425 --> 00:12:45,188
...than I dreamed of
when I was a kid.

210
00:12:45,728 --> 00:12:49,323
The only way for that to happen
is for me to watch this stinking show!

211
00:12:49,532 --> 00:12:51,363
So relax, hon.

212
00:12:54,904 --> 00:12:56,394
Are you kidding me?

213
00:12:56,605 --> 00:12:59,631
Will you give me a break one time?

214
00:13:00,109 --> 00:13:03,670
Damn it! The O'Doyles got
a stinking universal remote control.

215
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:05,710
We're gonna have one too.

216
00:13:05,915 --> 00:13:07,678
I'm sick of this.

217
00:13:12,288 --> 00:13:14,756
You want me to open
the garage for you?

218
00:13:27,736 --> 00:13:28,703
Closed.

219
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,407
Closed.

220
00:13:34,243 --> 00:13:35,210
Open.

221
00:13:35,411 --> 00:13:37,743
Bed Bath & Beyond it is.

222
00:13:43,118 --> 00:13:44,745
Hey, man?

223
00:13:44,954 --> 00:13:47,889
You guys got any universal
remote controls in there?

224
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:50,957
- For a shower curtain or a bathmat?
- For a television.

225
00:13:51,794 --> 00:13:54,092
I don't think so.
Maybe for a blanket?

226
00:13:54,296 --> 00:13:55,888
You got a remote for a blanket?

227
00:13:56,632 --> 00:13:59,066
Sorry, I don't work here.
I'm waiting for my friends.

228
00:13:59,268 --> 00:14:00,633
You're kidding me.

229
00:14:00,836 --> 00:14:03,862
Actually, yes. I don't have any friends.
Will you be my friend?

230
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,637
Wow, man.

231
00:14:12,615 --> 00:14:15,379
Bed. Bed.

232
00:14:15,584 --> 00:14:18,348
Bath. Bath.

233
00:14:18,554 --> 00:14:20,249
Bed.

234
00:14:22,424 --> 00:14:25,086
So tired of my life.

235
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:31,993
Beyond?

236
00:15:09,038 --> 00:15:10,869
Sorry to sneak up on you. I just...

237
00:15:11,073 --> 00:15:13,371
You guys got a universal
remote control back here?

238
00:15:15,744 --> 00:15:19,009
Something stinks
like stale french fries.

239
00:15:20,382 --> 00:15:22,350
All right, that's probably me.

240
00:15:22,551 --> 00:15:25,349
You know, fast food
shortens your life.

241
00:15:25,554 --> 00:15:26,782
Yeah, that's what I heard.

242
00:15:26,989 --> 00:15:30,152
But the way my life's been going
lately, that ain't such a bad thing.

243
00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:32,520
You're looking
for a universal remote control?

244
00:15:32,728 --> 00:15:35,162
Yeah. Just one device
to do it all for me...

245
00:15:35,364 --> 00:15:39,494
...make my life a little easier,
quicker, not so damn complicated.

246
00:15:39,702 --> 00:15:43,138
I'm not supposed to do this,
but you seem like a good guy.

247
00:15:43,338 --> 00:15:44,965
Hey. Somebody noticed. Thank you.

248
00:15:45,174 --> 00:15:47,233
I'm gonna show you a remote
we just got in...

249
00:15:47,443 --> 00:15:50,003
...that's probably the most advanced
piece of technology...

250
00:15:50,212 --> 00:15:51,304
...we have in this place.

251
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,410
- Sounds sweet.
- It is sweet.

252
00:15:54,616 --> 00:15:59,246
The latest, greatest universal remote
not even on the market yet.

253
00:15:59,455 --> 00:16:04,188
I guess the O'Doyles' remote can bite
my advanced-technological ass then.

254
00:16:04,393 --> 00:16:06,884
I don't know the O'Doyles...

255
00:16:08,097 --> 00:16:09,758
...but they can bite it hard.

256
00:16:09,965 --> 00:16:11,330
Yeah.

257
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:12,932
Come in the back with me.

258
00:16:13,435 --> 00:16:14,959
Okay.

259
00:16:15,938 --> 00:16:18,168
This is... This is very nice of you.

260
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,507
- What's your name, anyways?
- Call me Morty.

261
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,007
Morty, I'm Michael Newman.

262
00:16:23,412 --> 00:16:25,471
Michael Newman.

263
00:16:27,316 --> 00:16:29,216
I'm about to rock your world.

264
00:16:29,651 --> 00:16:30,845
Okay.

265
00:16:40,195 --> 00:16:43,995
I gotta be honest with you. This place
looks bigger from the outside.

266
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:45,962
Just kidding.

267
00:16:47,369 --> 00:16:48,734
Hey, hey.

268
00:17:07,856 --> 00:17:09,653
I think maybe there in the middle?

269
00:17:22,771 --> 00:17:24,739
Sneaky.

270
00:17:30,012 --> 00:17:32,242
Where's the box?
Does it come with directions?

271
00:17:32,447 --> 00:17:33,971
Not necessary.

272
00:17:34,183 --> 00:17:37,744
Just point, click.

273
00:17:37,953 --> 00:17:40,080
Eventually, it will program itself.

274
00:17:42,991 --> 00:17:43,980
How much is this thing?

275
00:17:44,193 --> 00:17:46,684
Because I ain't exactly
Thurston Howell, you know?

276
00:17:46,895 --> 00:17:50,194
Lucky for you, it's not
in the bar-code system yet.

277
00:17:50,399 --> 00:17:53,664
So I'm gonna have
to just give it to you.

278
00:17:53,869 --> 00:17:56,303
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's the catch here, man?

279
00:17:56,505 --> 00:17:59,941
Want me to take my shirt off for you?
Because I don't play for that team.

280
00:18:00,142 --> 00:18:02,838
Hey. Man, get out of here.

281
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,010
Why are you doing this, then?

282
00:18:05,214 --> 00:18:08,945
Because good guys need a break
every once in a while.

283
00:18:09,952 --> 00:18:11,146
Take it.

284
00:18:11,987 --> 00:18:12,954
Enjoy.

285
00:18:15,891 --> 00:18:17,119
All right.

286
00:18:17,326 --> 00:18:19,624
Only one thing
you need to know, Michael.

287
00:18:19,828 --> 00:18:22,490
This item is nonreturnable.

288
00:18:22,698 --> 00:18:26,225
Why would I wanna return something
I got for free?

289
00:18:47,623 --> 00:18:50,490
Twinkie. You don't need it.
You don't need it, man.

290
00:18:50,692 --> 00:18:53,991
You do need a Yodel, though.
Okay. Good job.

291
00:18:54,496 --> 00:18:57,021
Let's see what you got, mate.

292
00:19:04,473 --> 00:19:08,739
Look at me, turning my own TV on.
I'm a freaking whiz kid.

293
00:19:09,878 --> 00:19:11,778
- Residential architecture...

294
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,845
- So I talked to the kids.
- Oh, yeah?

295
00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:16,882
They're very understanding about
not going camping this weekend.

296
00:19:17,085 --> 00:19:19,849
- Great.
- They could have a sleepover instead.

297
00:19:20,055 --> 00:19:22,319
That's a great idea.
Thank you, thank you.

298
00:19:22,524 --> 00:19:25,152
Thanks for being
so cool about this too.

299
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,794
- Can I ask you something?
- Yes.

300
00:19:27,996 --> 00:19:31,955
After you do all this work and become
a big player at your company...

301
00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:34,465
...do you think you're gonna
have more time for us...

302
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:37,195
...or are things just gonna get
even more out of control?

303
00:19:37,406 --> 00:19:40,273
Wait. When I get to that place
and become a boss...

304
00:19:40,475 --> 00:19:43,137
...a millionaire, a big shot,
the first thing I'm gonna do...

305
00:19:43,345 --> 00:19:46,007
...is hire a bunch of idiots just like me
to do all my work.

306
00:19:46,214 --> 00:19:49,411
So then you, me and the kids
can do whatever the hell we want.

307
00:19:49,618 --> 00:19:51,552
You just gotta give me some time.

308
00:19:53,922 --> 00:19:55,753
Don't give me that look.

309
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:59,291
I'm just saying, give me some support.
All right?

310
00:19:59,494 --> 00:20:01,758
I love you. Go to sleep.

311
00:20:01,964 --> 00:20:05,024
- Just think about it, Michael.
- Absolutely.

312
00:20:05,233 --> 00:20:06,427
And stop with the Yodels.

313
00:20:06,635 --> 00:20:08,830
- You're gonna wake up 400 pounds.
- Okay.

314
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:25,116
Hey, hey, hey. Keep it down, dude.
Everybody's sleeping.

315
00:20:27,489 --> 00:20:28,649
You gotta poop again?

316
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:32,021
Why don't you do the humpy-pumpy
on the duck, okay?

317
00:20:33,428 --> 00:20:38,388
Will you just hold it in for five minutes
and keep the freaking volume down?

318
00:21:04,192 --> 00:21:05,386
I guess when you combine...

319
00:21:05,594 --> 00:21:08,995
...mass quantities of cough syrup
with Yodels...

320
00:21:09,197 --> 00:21:11,358
...you get acid.

321
00:21:15,203 --> 00:21:16,534
Go.

322
00:21:24,513 --> 00:21:26,811
Hey, you said you gotta go.
Go already, man.

323
00:21:33,388 --> 00:21:35,219
Sniffy Longdroppings, today.

324
00:22:06,321 --> 00:22:07,913
Holy motherfu...!

325
00:22:10,158 --> 00:22:12,285
Yeah, I mean, you're right.
In the short run...

326
00:22:12,494 --> 00:22:14,962
...plastic surgery is a hassle.

327
00:22:15,163 --> 00:22:17,495
But six months later...

328
00:22:17,699 --> 00:22:19,360
...I'm gonna have a face
and a body...

329
00:22:19,568 --> 00:22:21,934
...that's gonna get me to places
where I wanna be.

330
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:27,099
Oh, my mother, typical,
you know, she says:

331
00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:30,472
"Oh, this procedure is too risky."

332
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:34,046
If Samantha wanted her cheekbones
shaved down, I think I'd freak out too.

333
00:22:34,249 --> 00:22:37,377
I know, but I just think, you know,
they're too Slavic.

334
00:22:37,586 --> 00:22:39,213
You should get some work done.

335
00:22:39,421 --> 00:22:42,857
Then maybe Michael
will wanna hang out with you too.

336
00:22:44,659 --> 00:22:48,117
Morning, Michael.
You're looking very crappy today.

337
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:51,390
Morning, Janine,
you're looking very Slavic.

338
00:22:52,968 --> 00:22:56,665
You're just jealous because Donna
and I are going to the gym...

339
00:22:56,872 --> 00:22:58,965
...and all the guys
are gonna be hitting on us.

340
00:23:03,545 --> 00:23:06,378
Michael knows
he's my one and only.

341
00:23:06,581 --> 00:23:07,809
Forever and ever, babe.

342
00:23:08,617 --> 00:23:11,916
Sorry about last night.
And I love you. I'm s...

343
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,588
Oh, my God. I want that so bad.

344
00:23:14,789 --> 00:23:19,692
A husband that I can kiss and love
and give juice to.

345
00:23:19,895 --> 00:23:23,661
You've already cheated on three
different husbands with their brothers.

346
00:23:23,865 --> 00:23:26,663
I think you've given enough juice
to everybody.

347
00:23:28,203 --> 00:23:29,864
Love juice.

348
00:23:30,338 --> 00:23:32,772
You know way too much about me.

349
00:23:32,974 --> 00:23:35,875
I should never have done
that Montel Williams show.

350
00:23:36,077 --> 00:23:37,942
Even Montel Williams
thinks you're crazy...

351
00:23:38,146 --> 00:23:39,477
...and he's seen a lot of shit.

352
00:23:40,048 --> 00:23:42,676
I was desperate for companionship!

353
00:23:42,884 --> 00:23:44,613
All of my husbands...

354
00:23:44,819 --> 00:23:47,287
All of them
have emotionally abandoned me.

355
00:23:47,489 --> 00:23:51,255
They went to work. You had sex
with their unemployed brothers.

356
00:23:51,459 --> 00:23:53,427
- You're a horndog.
- Michael.

357
00:23:53,628 --> 00:23:55,755
- Okay, sweetie. Calm it down.
- No, no!

358
00:23:55,964 --> 00:23:59,365
I have had self-esteem issues
since I was a kid.

359
00:23:59,568 --> 00:24:03,561
I had a rabbit named Pepper.
And that rabbit abandoned me too!

360
00:24:03,772 --> 00:24:06,366
Even the rabbit did! Even the rabb...

361
00:24:12,514 --> 00:24:13,538
Don't look at me!

362
00:24:14,182 --> 00:24:16,150
- What's wrong with me?
- Bunny rabbit, bunny...

363
00:24:19,354 --> 00:24:22,790
Here's the pitch to Matsui.
A deep drive.

364
00:24:22,991 --> 00:24:25,221
Oh, my, it's out of here!

365
00:24:25,427 --> 00:24:30,364
A two-run shot into the right-field
seats for Hideki Matsui.

366
00:24:31,366 --> 00:24:32,765
I'm sorry. What was that?

367
00:24:32,968 --> 00:24:35,596
She has so many problems.
Why do you have to be so mean?

368
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:39,867
I don't know, l... Hello.

369
00:24:41,676 --> 00:24:43,337
I gotta go.

370
00:24:47,315 --> 00:24:49,510
Yeah, good RoboDog.

371
00:24:49,718 --> 00:24:52,186
And he can bark
in over six different languages.

372
00:24:52,387 --> 00:24:54,082
It's so cool.

373
00:24:54,289 --> 00:24:57,053
Yeah, it's much cooler
than your stupid, human dog.

374
00:24:57,259 --> 00:25:00,126
Hey, Dad, see Kevin's
new robot dog?

375
00:25:00,328 --> 00:25:02,057
Yeah, yeah. Very nice.

376
00:25:02,264 --> 00:25:05,859
"Very nice"? This thing
is worth more than your car.

377
00:25:07,769 --> 00:25:11,034
- Not anymore it ain't.
- RoboDog!

378
00:25:18,013 --> 00:25:19,913
Hey, hey, hey.

379
00:25:20,115 --> 00:25:24,484
Okay. Is this some sort
of reality show? Are you the host?

380
00:25:24,686 --> 00:25:27,086
Morty? Where are the cameras?

381
00:25:27,289 --> 00:25:32,056
Got everybody in on it, huh?
Sundance did very well also.

382
00:25:33,194 --> 00:25:37,392
All right, America! Have your laugh!
I'm an idiot!

383
00:25:37,966 --> 00:25:40,059
Donna, I'm gonna get you!

384
00:25:40,268 --> 00:25:41,929
Fast-forward.

385
00:25:43,638 --> 00:25:45,435
Nobody's laughing at you, Michael.

386
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:51,078
You wanted a universal remote control
that remote-controls your universe.

387
00:25:52,213 --> 00:25:55,580
Yeah, but what controls
my dance skills?

388
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:04,618
Oh, Morty likes it too.

389
00:26:06,861 --> 00:26:08,761
Michael, just hit menu.

390
00:26:09,631 --> 00:26:10,757
On the remote?

391
00:26:10,965 --> 00:26:14,628
No, the menu at the Red Lobster.
Yes, on the remote.

392
00:26:20,542 --> 00:26:21,804
Where are we?

393
00:26:26,247 --> 00:26:28,545
- Go, Michael, go!
- One Mississippi. Two Mississippi.

394
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,719
- What have I got here?
- Two, three.

395
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,411
Cough syrup's kicking in again.

396
00:26:34,622 --> 00:26:37,785
- We have a boy!
- Is it gonna work?

397
00:26:37,992 --> 00:26:39,118
What is this?

398
00:26:39,327 --> 00:26:41,921
- All right, I love you, Michael.
- Your life menu.

399
00:26:42,897 --> 00:26:44,728
My life has a commentary?

400
00:26:44,933 --> 00:26:47,231
It's chock-full of goodies.

401
00:26:47,435 --> 00:26:50,165
- Click it.
- Click it.

402
00:26:51,573 --> 00:26:54,064
This is last Tuesday.

403
00:26:54,275 --> 00:26:58,268
Michael was eagerly awaiting
the arrival of his lunch order.

404
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,038
Who's that, James Earl Jones?

405
00:27:00,248 --> 00:27:02,739
James Earl
does a lot of voice-over work.

406
00:27:02,951 --> 00:27:05,283
But his anticipation
quickly turned to dismay...

407
00:27:05,487 --> 00:27:08,081
...as he realized Alice
had brought him a cheeseburger...

408
00:27:08,289 --> 00:27:10,120
...instead of a hamburger
as he requested.

409
00:27:10,325 --> 00:27:12,350
A cheeseburger?
I said a hamburger.

410
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,720
She always does this to me.

411
00:27:13,928 --> 00:27:16,829
Michael considered demanding
that Alice scrape the cheese off...

412
00:27:17,031 --> 00:27:18,055
...but decided not to...

413
00:27:18,266 --> 00:27:19,824
...fearing that Alice may spit in...

414
00:27:20,034 --> 00:27:23,595
...or otherwise defile
the burger in some manner.

415
00:27:23,805 --> 00:27:25,432
A wise decision...

416
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,701
...for that was exactly
what Alice was planning to do.

417
00:27:31,112 --> 00:27:33,342
- Are you kidding me?
- Sneaky.

418
00:27:33,548 --> 00:27:35,778
My God.

419
00:27:39,421 --> 00:27:41,514
What else we got here?

420
00:27:43,091 --> 00:27:45,559
- "Making of"?
- Just click.

421
00:27:46,594 --> 00:27:49,563
Hey, hey, psychedelic.
Where are we?

422
00:27:51,099 --> 00:27:53,090
Is this a porno or something?

423
00:27:53,301 --> 00:27:55,667
Oh, Ted. Oh, Teddy!

424
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,132
Is that my parents?

425
00:27:57,338 --> 00:27:59,704
They're making you.
Like bunny rabbits.

426
00:27:59,908 --> 00:28:02,604
- That's the spot.
- Smack my heinie!

427
00:28:02,811 --> 00:28:06,042
Change the channel!
How do you do this?

428
00:28:07,348 --> 00:28:08,747
I can't see.

429
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:12,010
- What happened?
- What...?

430
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:16,657
The floor is so mushy and slippery.
Feels good on my feet.

431
00:28:16,858 --> 00:28:19,986
Check it out.
You hit the fast-forward button.

432
00:28:20,195 --> 00:28:22,755
I believe we're sometime
after your conception.

433
00:28:22,964 --> 00:28:25,296
Okay, very good, Mrs. Newman.

434
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,594
No! We're in my mother's vagina?

435
00:28:28,803 --> 00:28:31,499
Again. And push.

436
00:28:31,706 --> 00:28:34,539
- It's a girl.
- It's a girl!

437
00:28:34,742 --> 00:28:37,734
- Oh, It's a girl. Thank you so much.
- Thank you for that.

438
00:28:37,946 --> 00:28:40,414
Wait a minute.
I'm sorry, it might be a boy.

439
00:28:40,615 --> 00:28:42,515
What do you mean, "might be"?
What is that?

440
00:28:42,717 --> 00:28:43,911
Maybe that's a penis.

441
00:28:44,118 --> 00:28:46,678
Maybe that's a pe...? That's a penis.
That's my penis.

442
00:28:46,888 --> 00:28:50,016
Can I see that?
Can you bring that a little closer?

443
00:28:50,225 --> 00:28:51,192
See?

444
00:28:51,626 --> 00:28:53,651
- That's a tiny schmeckel.
- Yeah?

445
00:28:53,862 --> 00:28:55,329
- We have a boy!
- We have a boy!

446
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:59,796
Your mother must have
some superpower eyesight...

447
00:29:00,001 --> 00:29:02,936
...because I didn't see anything.

448
00:29:03,137 --> 00:29:04,331
Let's get out of here.

449
00:29:06,608 --> 00:29:08,576
So if you think about it...

450
00:29:08,776 --> 00:29:12,303
...I can reexperience
any part of my life I want to.

451
00:29:12,514 --> 00:29:14,038
It's amazing.

452
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,583
What happened?
Oh, God, what did I do?

453
00:29:18,786 --> 00:29:20,879
Hello? How do I get you
back here, pal?

454
00:29:22,156 --> 00:29:23,123
Gotcha.

455
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:25,986
I'm not freaked out enough?

456
00:29:26,194 --> 00:29:28,025
It's simple. Think of a time
and a place...

457
00:29:28,229 --> 00:29:30,789
...hit rewind, and you're there.

458
00:29:31,933 --> 00:29:34,424
Time and a place. Time and a place.

459
00:29:40,275 --> 00:29:43,301
Oh, my God. Lake Winnipesaukee.

460
00:29:43,778 --> 00:29:46,008
That's me in the Jets shirt.

461
00:29:46,214 --> 00:29:47,875
Go, little me, go!

462
00:29:51,286 --> 00:29:53,254
Good hands! Nice hands.

463
00:29:53,454 --> 00:29:54,682
Michael!

464
00:29:55,189 --> 00:29:59,489
Michael, dinner's almost ready.
Invite your friends if you want to.

465
00:30:00,094 --> 00:30:03,530
So any of you wanna come
by my tent for some supper?

466
00:30:03,731 --> 00:30:06,666
Or we could eat at my Winnebago
and watch Three's Company.

467
00:30:09,404 --> 00:30:10,996
Three's Company.

468
00:30:11,539 --> 00:30:13,837
That's humiliating.

469
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:19,669
Mom, why can't we camp in an RV
like every other family?

470
00:30:19,881 --> 00:30:21,712
Oh, come on.
You call that camping?

471
00:30:21,916 --> 00:30:24,510
How can you get close to nature
in a tin can like that?

472
00:30:24,719 --> 00:30:28,211
Plus, it's more fun to have
to keep each other warm at night.

473
00:30:28,756 --> 00:30:30,348
Don't you know it.

474
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,230
- No cupcakes yet.
- But I'm starving.

475
00:30:42,437 --> 00:30:44,701
I agree with you, Michael.
You know how hungry I am?

476
00:30:44,906 --> 00:30:47,898
I am so hungry, I could eat this.

477
00:30:48,109 --> 00:30:50,577
Oh, this is where
the quarter trick started.

478
00:30:57,118 --> 00:30:58,710
How the heck did he do that?

479
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,083
Oh, it's a trick coin
you buy at a magic shop.

480
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,315
I just couldn't let him know
I knew that.

481
00:31:04,525 --> 00:31:05,992
That's sweet.

482
00:31:06,194 --> 00:31:09,129
Now, I gotta get back to work,
so hit play.

483
00:31:17,171 --> 00:31:20,766
It's a very powerful device.
Use it with caution.

484
00:31:20,975 --> 00:31:22,408
Okay.

485
00:31:23,945 --> 00:31:24,934
Who are you?

486
00:31:25,747 --> 00:31:27,237
You know who I am.

487
00:31:28,282 --> 00:31:29,408
Morty?

488
00:31:29,617 --> 00:31:32,108
If you have any questions...

489
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,312
...call me.

490
00:31:42,764 --> 00:31:47,599
No, Linda, I think Stacy gets
the most-beautiful-feet award.

491
00:31:47,802 --> 00:31:49,326
You wanted to see me?

492
00:31:49,537 --> 00:31:52,597
Michael. Look, I'm heading out to
the Hamptons in a couple of minutes.

493
00:31:52,807 --> 00:31:53,933
I'm counting on you.

494
00:31:54,142 --> 00:31:56,201
This hotel project? It's a big fish.

495
00:31:56,411 --> 00:32:00,279
You reel it in for me
and it's "Howdy, partner."

496
00:32:03,751 --> 00:32:05,150
Okay. Thank you.

497
00:32:05,353 --> 00:32:09,084
Screw it up, though, and it's
"Back to the mailroom, atrium boy."

498
00:32:11,693 --> 00:32:12,990
Mr. Ammer, Denise just called.

499
00:32:13,194 --> 00:32:16,561
She's gotta go to rehab again,
so she can't make it to the Hamptons.

500
00:32:16,764 --> 00:32:18,994
I'm gonna be alone
on the Fourth of July?

501
00:32:19,367 --> 00:32:22,097
Mr. Ammer, if you need female
companionship this weekend...

502
00:32:22,303 --> 00:32:24,794
...my wife's friend Janine, wow.

503
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,571
Really? What's she like?

504
00:32:30,244 --> 00:32:35,011
Let's just say
she will eat you up, sir.

505
00:32:37,151 --> 00:32:38,709
Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt...

506
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,047
...but this is kind of important.
- Okay.

507
00:32:42,957 --> 00:32:45,016
- Go to the bathroom.
- Okay.

508
00:32:56,237 --> 00:32:59,263
Dude! You suck so bad.

509
00:32:59,474 --> 00:33:01,533
Do not. Hey, Dad.

510
00:33:01,743 --> 00:33:03,506
How you doing, buddy?
Playing some catch?

511
00:33:03,711 --> 00:33:07,545
Actually, we're playing some drop,
because Ben hasn't caught one yet.

512
00:33:07,749 --> 00:33:09,512
Darn it.

513
00:33:23,498 --> 00:33:25,693
You're a regular Derek Jeter
yourself, O'Doyle.

514
00:33:26,067 --> 00:33:28,558
- Love you, kid.
- Love you too, Dad.

515
00:33:29,337 --> 00:33:31,862
Mommy!

516
00:33:32,673 --> 00:33:35,335
No, I know. Well, I thought
she should've gotten voted off.

517
00:33:35,543 --> 00:33:37,977
But did you see her Kate Spade
handbag? It was gorgeous.

518
00:33:38,179 --> 00:33:40,807
Wait, hold on a second, Trudy.
I gotta say hi to your son.

519
00:33:41,015 --> 00:33:45,042
- I told your parents to come for dinner.
- Really? That sounds good.

520
00:33:45,253 --> 00:33:47,653
It'd be fun for them to be here
for the sleepover.

521
00:33:49,423 --> 00:33:51,152
Okay, so great. Yeah.

522
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:53,759
We'll see you guys later.
Okay, bye-bye.

523
00:33:53,961 --> 00:33:57,089
It's not gonna kill you to eat dinner
with your family, sweetie.

524
00:33:57,298 --> 00:34:00,131
I know, I just gotta build
an entire model tonight.

525
00:34:01,469 --> 00:34:04,927
- I'm the leader!
- No, I'm the leader!

526
00:34:06,908 --> 00:34:08,842
Go say hi to Daddy. Go on.

527
00:34:11,846 --> 00:34:14,314
I can't take a whole night of this.

528
00:34:14,515 --> 00:34:17,814
- And I'm not going to.
- Q, R, S, T, U...

529
00:34:23,891 --> 00:34:25,290
Cool.

530
00:34:25,493 --> 00:34:28,690
I can skip chapters.

531
00:34:34,502 --> 00:34:35,833
What a family.

532
00:34:37,538 --> 00:34:41,304
All right, let's get dinner
over with. Next.

533
00:34:41,509 --> 00:34:42,942
Next.

534
00:34:43,144 --> 00:34:46,170
Everyone's done but you, buddy.
Let's go.

535
00:34:48,249 --> 00:34:50,615
Will you stop already?

536
00:34:50,818 --> 00:34:54,686
Oh, boy, Dad's quarter trick.
I can't wait not to see it.

537
00:34:56,657 --> 00:34:58,454
Alone in my basement at last.

538
00:34:58,659 --> 00:35:02,720
Should I do my work
and become partner now? I think so.

539
00:35:04,365 --> 00:35:06,230
Let's get to it.

540
00:35:07,034 --> 00:35:08,501
- Michael?
- Yo.

541
00:35:08,703 --> 00:35:10,261
We don't wanna interrupt.

542
00:35:10,471 --> 00:35:12,302
We're taking off.
Thanks for a great night.

543
00:35:12,506 --> 00:35:14,167
You had a fun time
hanging out with me?

544
00:35:14,375 --> 00:35:16,309
That was... We did good, right?

545
00:35:16,878 --> 00:35:18,368
- Good night, honey.
- Love you.

546
00:35:18,946 --> 00:35:23,076
My schmeckel got bigger now that
I'm older, just so you guys know that.

547
00:35:23,284 --> 00:35:25,684
It couldn't have gotten any smaller.

548
00:35:26,487 --> 00:35:27,579
Yeah, yeah.

549
00:35:27,788 --> 00:35:30,882
It looked like a little Tic Tac.

550
00:35:31,092 --> 00:35:34,152
Yeah, come here,
I'll freshen your breath.

551
00:35:35,363 --> 00:35:36,796
- Bye, you guys.
- Bye, sweetie.

552
00:35:36,998 --> 00:35:38,898
Good night, sweetie.

553
00:35:41,469 --> 00:35:43,027
Great dinner, honey.

554
00:35:43,237 --> 00:35:45,501
See? Was that so bad?

555
00:35:45,706 --> 00:35:47,571
Kidding me? I had fun.

556
00:35:47,775 --> 00:35:51,506
Good for you. Can you watch the gang
for 10 minutes while I clean up?

557
00:35:51,712 --> 00:35:54,010
Can't you? I just...
I got so much stuff to do here.

558
00:35:54,215 --> 00:35:55,614
Oh, you got stuff to do?

559
00:35:55,816 --> 00:35:58,250
I got ghost stories, charades,
the dishes...

560
00:35:58,452 --> 00:36:01,216
...and then I gotta sew the duck's head
back on for Sundance...

561
00:36:01,422 --> 00:36:03,049
...and fix his butthole.

562
00:36:03,257 --> 00:36:04,349
Way to go, champ.

563
00:36:05,893 --> 00:36:07,758
I wish I had time to do all that stuff.

564
00:36:07,962 --> 00:36:09,395
Give me a break, Michael.

565
00:36:09,597 --> 00:36:11,565
You're a big boy.
You set your own priorities.

566
00:36:11,766 --> 00:36:14,132
I'm asking for 10 minutes,
not for, like, a whole day.

567
00:36:14,335 --> 00:36:15,700
You don't have to do that much.

568
00:36:15,903 --> 00:36:18,701
How big a deal is that?
I am so tired of having this argument.

569
00:36:26,547 --> 00:36:29,277
I skipped the whole fight.

570
00:36:32,353 --> 00:36:33,820
Babe?

571
00:36:35,289 --> 00:36:37,587
- I can't sleep.
- You can't?

572
00:36:37,792 --> 00:36:39,384
I feel bad that we keep arguing.

573
00:36:39,593 --> 00:36:42,721
I know. Don't be upset, okay?

574
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:46,297
- I was a jerk.
- You are a jerk.

575
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,058
- I love you.
- I love you too.

576
00:36:49,236 --> 00:36:51,227
- Yes. That smells good.
- What?

577
00:36:53,808 --> 00:36:55,867
Michael. Stop it.
The sleepover will catch us.

578
00:36:56,077 --> 00:36:58,170
They ain't gonna hear us. Come on.

579
00:36:58,946 --> 00:37:01,938
Okay. Quietly try
and coax me into it.

580
00:37:02,149 --> 00:37:04,140
I gotta get back to work.
Can't we just do it?

581
00:37:04,352 --> 00:37:06,320
No, we can't just do it.
Honey, come on.

582
00:37:06,854 --> 00:37:10,585
I mean, I don't have any new moves
for you. It's the same stuff.

583
00:37:10,791 --> 00:37:13,487
Just think of last time and use that.

584
00:37:13,694 --> 00:37:16,322
I like the old moves. Come on.

585
00:37:17,898 --> 00:37:18,865
All right.

586
00:37:19,066 --> 00:37:21,034
This time you be Sundance,
I'll be the duck.

587
00:37:21,235 --> 00:37:24,636
- Yeah?
- But you gotta massage me first.

588
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:28,138
Great, I love giving massages.

589
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,648
Massaging away here.

590
00:37:37,785 --> 00:37:40,845
Oh, that feels good.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

591
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,733
- We did it?
- Well, you did.

592
00:37:57,271 --> 00:37:59,967
I didn't want the whole thing
to go that fast.

593
00:38:00,174 --> 00:38:02,472
I don't think anybody did.

594
00:38:02,877 --> 00:38:05,243
Yeah. I'll get you next time.

595
00:38:05,446 --> 00:38:07,073
Thanks.

596
00:38:08,049 --> 00:38:10,108
So we good for tomorrow?

597
00:38:11,752 --> 00:38:13,379
What are you talking about?

598
00:38:13,587 --> 00:38:14,815
At dinner.

599
00:38:15,022 --> 00:38:18,514
You said we'd go to lunch tomorrow
and pick out your dad's birthday gift.

600
00:38:21,462 --> 00:38:22,929
Dad's gift is...

601
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:26,930
- Of course. I said so, so I'll be there.
- Okay.

602
00:38:27,768 --> 00:38:30,134
- Need another massage or anything?
- Oh, go away.

603
00:38:30,337 --> 00:38:32,202
I gotta go work.

604
00:38:33,574 --> 00:38:35,735
Hey, Morty. It's Michael Newman.

605
00:38:35,943 --> 00:38:38,411
Yeah, can I talk to you for a minute?

606
00:38:40,214 --> 00:38:42,808
Hang on for a second,
someone's at my door.

607
00:38:45,786 --> 00:38:48,687
- Hello, Michael.
- Where'd you come from?

608
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:51,085
You don't wanna know.

609
00:38:53,694 --> 00:38:56,026
- Can we take a walk?
- Sure.

610
00:38:57,765 --> 00:39:01,166
It's simple. You must
have been on autopilot.

611
00:39:01,368 --> 00:39:02,460
Autopilot?

612
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:05,230
That's what happens to you
when you fast-forward.

613
00:39:05,439 --> 00:39:07,373
- Okay.
- Yeah. I'll show you.

614
00:39:07,575 --> 00:39:08,974
Here.

615
00:39:12,713 --> 00:39:15,705
See? That's you on autopilot.

616
00:39:15,916 --> 00:39:18,476
The lights are on
but nobody's home.

617
00:39:18,686 --> 00:39:20,916
The remote lets your mind
skip around...

618
00:39:21,122 --> 00:39:23,716
...but your body actually stays put
for the boring stuff.

619
00:39:23,924 --> 00:39:26,950
We should go to lunch tomorrow
and pick out your dad's birthday gift.

620
00:39:27,161 --> 00:39:28,753
Sounds good.

621
00:39:28,963 --> 00:39:30,123
So she did tell me.

622
00:39:30,331 --> 00:39:33,323
I'm having conversations
on autopilot, then.

623
00:39:33,534 --> 00:39:36,094
You're not gonna be
the life of the party, but yes.

624
00:39:36,303 --> 00:39:38,567
Everyone goes on autopilot
now and then.

625
00:39:38,772 --> 00:39:41,639
The big difference
is now you've got a nifty remote...

626
00:39:41,842 --> 00:39:44,174
...to help you decide when.

627
00:39:44,378 --> 00:39:46,278
This thing is the best.

628
00:39:46,881 --> 00:39:50,339
By the way, your wife?
Absolutely gorgeous.

629
00:39:50,551 --> 00:39:55,113
- She is, isn't she?
- Perfect face. Tight, rocking body.

630
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:57,357
You okay?

631
00:39:58,826 --> 00:40:01,158
- Amazing.
- What is?

632
00:40:01,362 --> 00:40:03,421
She fell for a schlub like you.

633
00:40:03,631 --> 00:40:05,223
I'm a schlub?

634
00:40:05,432 --> 00:40:08,367
I don't know about that, pal.
I see a good-Iooking man right there.

635
00:40:10,104 --> 00:40:13,267
You wanna see what a stud
I used to be? Yeah?

636
00:40:13,474 --> 00:40:15,738
All right, let's take a look
at some of the girls...

637
00:40:15,943 --> 00:40:18,537
...I used to fool around with
before I met Donna.

638
00:40:28,322 --> 00:40:30,347
Is that a man or a woman?

639
00:40:30,558 --> 00:40:32,492
It's a woman.

640
00:40:35,896 --> 00:40:37,796
What is this, Animal Planet?

641
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,034
- Stop.
- Yes.

642
00:40:44,205 --> 00:40:50,075
Sometimes it's better to keep
certain memories just in your head.

643
00:40:50,277 --> 00:40:51,869
So I've learned, Morty.

644
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,979
Good night. Thank you.

645
00:40:54,481 --> 00:40:56,244
Good night, Michael.

646
00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:08,061
I'm getting sick, man.
Fast-forward me till I'm better.

647
00:41:09,597 --> 00:41:12,998
Michael, honey, wake up.
You'll be late for work.

648
00:41:13,634 --> 00:41:16,694
What? It's Monday already?

649
00:41:25,879 --> 00:41:28,006
Are you kidding me?
No more phlegm?

650
00:41:28,215 --> 00:41:29,842
I skipped an entire cold?

651
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:32,541
Thanks to you, baby! I love you!

652
00:41:32,753 --> 00:41:34,277
No more Tylenol!

653
00:41:34,488 --> 00:41:36,456
I don't remember doing
any work this weekend.

654
00:41:38,993 --> 00:41:40,620
But apparently I did.

655
00:41:41,161 --> 00:41:44,597
- Bad news. There's no hot water.
- What? I gotta take a shower.

656
00:41:44,798 --> 00:41:47,232
Well, you're gonna freeze
your bun-buns off.

657
00:41:48,202 --> 00:41:50,500
It's all good.

658
00:41:57,244 --> 00:41:59,178
Yes! Look at me.

659
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:03,407
All showered and dressed
and looking sexy.

660
00:42:03,617 --> 00:42:05,312
I like that. L...

661
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,284
Did you smoke crack, Daddy?

662
00:42:08,856 --> 00:42:11,916
Just watch your toons and have
a great day with Mommy today, okay?

663
00:42:15,095 --> 00:42:18,121
Eating cupcakes like your old man.
Right here, baby.

664
00:42:18,332 --> 00:42:19,890
- Dad?
- Yes, sir?

665
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,625
Are you gonna have to work late
again tonight?

666
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:26,906
- Unfortunately, yes.
- Is there anything we can do to help?

667
00:42:27,675 --> 00:42:31,042
Well, I'm gonna be partner soon, and
I'm gonna need new building designs.

668
00:42:31,245 --> 00:42:33,907
So if you guys have any cool ideas,
draw them up for me.

669
00:42:34,114 --> 00:42:35,581
- Okay.
- Rock 'n' roll.

670
00:42:35,783 --> 00:42:38,752
- I get the paper.
- I got the crayons.

671
00:42:44,525 --> 00:42:46,993
Would you stop talking
and fix the sewer?

672
00:43:06,747 --> 00:43:10,012
You're on it now, yeah. Yeah.

673
00:43:10,217 --> 00:43:13,948
Traffic, traffic, no more traffic.

674
00:43:16,223 --> 00:43:17,884
Wait a sec!

675
00:43:20,761 --> 00:43:23,195
Here we go! Mama!

676
00:43:23,397 --> 00:43:26,958
Yeah! That's what
I'm talking about, baby!

677
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:32,867
You look a little pale there, pal.
Let me fix that.

678
00:43:37,044 --> 00:43:40,980
Oh, look at you now.
You're all yellow from the scurvy.

679
00:43:41,181 --> 00:43:42,205
Captain.

680
00:43:44,952 --> 00:43:49,582
Don't get the Hulk angry.
You won't like him when he's angry.

681
00:44:00,401 --> 00:44:01,561
Oh, there's Barney.

682
00:44:01,769 --> 00:44:05,068
I love you, you love me

683
00:44:05,272 --> 00:44:09,572
That jogger had giant boobies

684
00:44:09,977 --> 00:44:14,209
Okay. Let's get you that tan
you been searching for.

685
00:44:14,415 --> 00:44:16,076
That's it. That's it.

686
00:44:16,283 --> 00:44:20,276
Check out Julio Iglesias... Pretty.

687
00:44:23,056 --> 00:44:27,117
- Looking good, Mr. Newman.
- Really? Thank you very much, Judy.

688
00:44:27,327 --> 00:44:31,058
- Finish?
- Did I finish? I believe I finished.

689
00:44:31,265 --> 00:44:34,701
- Let's see here. Look at that.
- Very impressive, Michael.

690
00:44:34,902 --> 00:44:38,861
Yeah, the river in the lobby.
This is actually pretty good, man.

691
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,371
Where did you find the time
to get a tan?

692
00:44:42,876 --> 00:44:45,868
- I guess I can do it all, sir.
- You can do it all.

693
00:44:46,513 --> 00:44:50,609
All right, all right, everybody.
It's sexual-harassment-speech day.

694
00:44:51,985 --> 00:44:54,146
Now, anyone can be a victim
of sexual harassment:

695
00:44:54,354 --> 00:44:58,814
Blue collar, white collar,
a woman, a man.

696
00:44:59,026 --> 00:45:01,290
Even the office slut.

697
00:45:01,495 --> 00:45:03,929
Not that I'm mentioning any names...

698
00:45:04,131 --> 00:45:05,359
...Stacy.

699
00:45:08,869 --> 00:45:12,999
Here we go. Sexual harassment
can come in many forms.

700
00:45:14,441 --> 00:45:17,899
You see, what is hilarious to some,
could be offensive to others.

701
00:45:18,612 --> 00:45:22,412
Let me try to give you a real-life
example because I'm sure I've done it.

702
00:45:24,117 --> 00:45:27,644
Like the day I said, "You want
a promotion, break out the lotion."

703
00:45:27,855 --> 00:45:30,517
I was technically engaged
in sexual harassment.

704
00:45:31,291 --> 00:45:34,749
Hilarious sexual harassment,
if you ask me.

705
00:45:39,666 --> 00:45:44,467
Now, there is also
homosexual harassment.

706
00:45:44,671 --> 00:45:47,435
Now, this is like when
one dude comes up to another...

707
00:45:47,641 --> 00:45:50,041
...and says something cheeky.
- This will be good.

708
00:46:13,901 --> 00:46:15,163
Proceed.

709
00:46:21,108 --> 00:46:23,474
I don't know about you Americans...

710
00:46:23,677 --> 00:46:26,908
...but to me there is no doubt...

711
00:46:27,114 --> 00:46:29,981
...Ichiro is the greatest of all time.

712
00:46:30,183 --> 00:46:31,741
Yeah, he's incredible.

713
00:46:31,952 --> 00:46:34,011
You gotta admit,
you can always count on Matsui.

714
00:46:34,221 --> 00:46:35,848
Oh, Matsui.

715
00:46:36,056 --> 00:46:39,514
Well, if you guys love Ichiro and
Matsui so much, let's order them both.

716
00:46:41,028 --> 00:46:42,757
I'll eat anything.

717
00:46:42,963 --> 00:46:46,364
- Excuse us for a moment.
- Absolutely, Mr. Watsuhita.

718
00:46:46,567 --> 00:46:48,660
See you guys in a bit.

719
00:46:48,869 --> 00:46:52,930
Ichiro and Matsui are baseball players.
You just insulted their national heroes.

720
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:55,665
I'm going to the bathroom
to slit my wrists.

721
00:46:55,876 --> 00:46:57,571
I'll be here.

722
00:47:13,827 --> 00:47:14,987
These morons are so boring.

723
00:47:15,195 --> 00:47:17,356
They make me wanna
chop my own dick off.

724
00:47:18,665 --> 00:47:20,462
That hotel design?
I'd like to rip it up.

725
00:47:20,667 --> 00:47:23,261
Egghead watched a bad documentary
on Asian architecture.

726
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:25,199
Who needs a stupid river
in the lobby?

727
00:47:25,405 --> 00:47:27,396
Let's build more rooms
and maximize profits.

728
00:47:27,608 --> 00:47:29,200
Eat as fast as you can.

729
00:47:29,409 --> 00:47:30,706
Then we can get out of here...

730
00:47:30,911 --> 00:47:33,812
...and do Jell-O shots at America's
greatest cultural achievement:

731
00:47:34,014 --> 00:47:35,038
T.G.I. Friday's.

732
00:47:35,248 --> 00:47:36,738
T.G.I. Friday's!

733
00:47:40,354 --> 00:47:44,085
- All right, Michael, save us.
- I'm all over it, baby.

734
00:47:45,425 --> 00:47:49,293
Before we order, I was looking
at our proposal. You know what?

735
00:47:49,496 --> 00:47:53,125
After getting to know you a little bit,
I realize this is not what you're about.

736
00:47:53,333 --> 00:47:56,598
In fact, let's just throw it out, all right?
Start from scratch.

737
00:47:56,803 --> 00:47:59,670
The river in the lobby idea,
what an egghead move.

738
00:47:59,873 --> 00:48:03,707
Let's just keep the plans simple, forget
all the niceties, maximize our revenue.

739
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:06,003
That's what it's all about anyways,
the profits.

740
00:48:06,213 --> 00:48:09,444
But do me a favor. Just give us
your account and your trust.

741
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:12,915
That way we can get the hell out
of this dump, go to T.G.I. Friday's...

742
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,850
...do some Jell-O shots
till this guy pukes up a lung.

743
00:48:17,658 --> 00:48:18,818
Fuck, yeah.

744
00:48:22,462 --> 00:48:24,191
That's what I'm talking about.

745
00:48:30,537 --> 00:48:32,004
Yes, yes!

746
00:48:32,205 --> 00:48:36,164
The king is home! Hello, hello!

747
00:48:37,344 --> 00:48:41,371
How can you goons sleep
when you know I got you presents?

748
00:48:41,581 --> 00:48:43,014
- You did?
- What is it?

749
00:48:43,216 --> 00:48:47,312
What is it? Well, if you bring
your tushies downstairs, we'll find out.

750
00:48:48,321 --> 00:48:50,186
I'm coming. I'm coming.

751
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:54,326
Honey, get your sweet little buns
downstairs too. Come on, come on!

752
00:48:57,898 --> 00:48:59,957
Come and get them.

753
00:49:00,834 --> 00:49:03,894
- Awesome! No way!
- Yeah, yeah.

754
00:49:04,671 --> 00:49:08,163
- It must have cost a million dollars!
- That's chump change now.

755
00:49:08,375 --> 00:49:09,569
You guys deserve the best...

756
00:49:09,776 --> 00:49:12,176
...and that's what you're gonna get
from now on, okay?

757
00:49:12,379 --> 00:49:13,676
What's all this?

758
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,973
Look who's here.
You guys wanna ride these bikes?

759
00:49:16,183 --> 00:49:18,174
- Yeah!
- Let's take them outside!

760
00:49:18,385 --> 00:49:20,649
Wake the O'Doyles,
let them see what you got.

761
00:49:24,624 --> 00:49:28,025
These are the coolest bikes
in the whole town.

762
00:49:28,228 --> 00:49:30,662
Kevin O'Doyle's gonna shit himself.

763
00:49:30,864 --> 00:49:34,231
- Don't think I forgot my beautiful wife.
- Oh, my gosh.

764
00:49:34,434 --> 00:49:38,302
It's not a bike or a cowboy hat,
but you're gonna like this, I hope.

765
00:49:38,672 --> 00:49:42,005
- Oh, Michael, it's beautiful.
- I heard you talking to my mother.

766
00:49:42,209 --> 00:49:44,439
- I love it!
- You look good, baby.

767
00:49:44,644 --> 00:49:47,841
I got myself a celebratory cigar too.
Why not?

768
00:49:48,048 --> 00:49:49,606
What are we celebrating?

769
00:49:49,816 --> 00:49:54,116
"What are we celebrating?"
We're healthy, we got a great family...

770
00:49:54,321 --> 00:49:56,585
...I'm Ammer's newest partner...

771
00:49:56,790 --> 00:50:00,191
Oh, my God, you're kidding!
Honey, congratulations!

772
00:50:00,393 --> 00:50:03,624
I knew it! I knew you'd be psyched!
I love it! I love you!

773
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:06,094
I single-handedly landed
the Watsuhita account.

774
00:50:06,299 --> 00:50:08,665
That's incredible.
I knew it was gonna be a great day.

775
00:50:08,869 --> 00:50:11,770
- I heard our song on the radio.
- We have a song?

776
00:50:12,339 --> 00:50:16,776
Honey. The song that was playing
during our first kiss.

777
00:50:18,845 --> 00:50:20,779
Come on. You're kidding me, right?

778
00:50:22,616 --> 00:50:27,644
I know our song. Our song. Of course
I know our song. Our song is...

779
00:50:27,854 --> 00:50:30,152
What the hell was that song?

780
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:34,093
I remember this place.

781
00:50:34,294 --> 00:50:37,195
And... Oh, my God.

782
00:50:37,397 --> 00:50:40,161
Wolverine's goofy cousin.

783
00:50:40,901 --> 00:50:45,929
But look at you. Wow.
You are out of his league, aren't you?

784
00:50:48,642 --> 00:50:50,269
Oh, yeah, the notes.

785
00:50:50,477 --> 00:50:52,468
Smooth, buddy.

786
00:50:58,318 --> 00:50:59,979
Oh, look at her.

787
00:51:01,521 --> 00:51:05,457
What's gonna happen?
You got an answer to that?

788
00:51:08,695 --> 00:51:12,187
Okay. Seal the deal, pal.

789
00:51:19,673 --> 00:51:22,437
All she's thinking about is,
"I am not kissing that beard.

790
00:51:22,642 --> 00:51:24,303
Absolutely not,
that's gonna hurt me."

791
00:51:25,045 --> 00:51:26,808
Wait a minute.

792
00:51:29,716 --> 00:51:32,014
Yeah, Newman. Get it.

793
00:51:33,787 --> 00:51:35,448
Yeah.

794
00:51:39,125 --> 00:51:40,615
Donna!

795
00:51:40,827 --> 00:51:43,455
Donna. Oh, my God.

796
00:51:44,264 --> 00:51:45,891
I'm so horny now.

797
00:51:46,099 --> 00:51:49,796
Oh, God, I'm not.
Get me out of here.

798
00:51:51,972 --> 00:51:56,602
"Linger" by The Cranberries
was playing during our first juicy kiss.

799
00:51:56,810 --> 00:52:00,268
And, my God, you looked beautiful
in that pink sweater you were wearing.

800
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,141
Honey, you remember
what I was wearing?

801
00:52:02,349 --> 00:52:04,317
Of course. I remember
what Janine was wearing.

802
00:52:04,517 --> 00:52:06,747
She scared the shit out of me then.

803
00:52:10,257 --> 00:52:11,884
I love you.

804
00:52:12,092 --> 00:52:14,788
I love you too, honey.

805
00:52:15,305 --> 00:52:21,221
