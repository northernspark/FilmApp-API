2
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,440
In America...

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,960
... there's a burglary
every 1 1 seconds...

4
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,040
...an armed robbery
every 65 seconds...

5
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,960
...a violent crime
every 25 seconds...

6
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,800
...a murder every 24 minutes...

7
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,120
...and 250 rapes a day.

8
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,960
Jerry, don't push it together like that.

9
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,680
Will you just let me do it?

10
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,080
You make me sick!

11
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,080
Watch it!

12
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,800
Hey, pal!

13
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,240
Can I help you?

14
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,520
We are willing to talk.
No one wants to hurt you.

15
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,400
Do you understand?

16
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,240
We are willing to talk.
There's no more need for violence.

17
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,440
There's no way out except by talking.
Do you understand?

18
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,920
No one wants to hurt you.

19
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,520
We want to help.

20
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,840
Please, communicate with us.

21
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,000
You can go.

22
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,040
You can go!

23
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,360
You're free!

24
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,480
No one wants to hurt you.
Do you understand?

25
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,160
-Enough of trying to deal with this maniac!
-Get down!

26
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,200
All we need is more time.
We can get control of the situation.

27
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,960
What control?

28
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,160
Call the Cobra.

29
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,200
-How bad is it?
-It's bad.

30
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,520
Any l.D. on the guy?

31
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,320
Just another asshole who woke up
hating the world. What's happening?

32
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,080
I don't agree with them bringing you
in here. I just want you to know that.

33
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,280
Come on.

34
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,080
Come on!

35
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,920
Move!

36
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,760
Get down, you.
Get down there, man.

37
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,720
Shut up!
You get away from her!

38
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,680
Shut up!

39
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,120
I'll kill you, man.
I'll kill them all!

40
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,200
It's the way of the New World.

41
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,960
So where are those TV cameras?

42
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,800
Hey man, I've got a bomb here.

43
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,680
I'll kill them all!

44
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,400
You bring in the TV,
or I'll kill them all.

45
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,240
You understand?

46
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,680
It's the way of the New World!

47
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,720
What are you waiting for?
Let's go!

48
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,080
Come on over here, I'll kill them.
You got that?

49
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,520
You're all trash, anyway.
You all deserve it.

50
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,440
Dirtbag!

51
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,680
You're a lousy shot.

52
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,680
I don't like lousy shots.

53
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,600
You wasted a kid for nothing.

54
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,280
Now I think it's time to waste you.

55
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,200
Hold it!

56
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,280
Come on, man.

57
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,840
I got a bomb here.

58
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,400
I'll kill her.

59
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,440
I'll blow this place up.

60
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,960
Go ahead.

61
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,000
I don't shop here.

62
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,120
Just relax, amigo.

63
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,560
You want to talk?

64
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,920
We'll talk.
I'm a sucker for good conversation.

65
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,200
I don't want to talk to you.

66
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,120
You bring the television cameras
in here now. Come on, bring it in!

67
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,640
I can't do that.

68
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,920
Why?

69
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,360
I don't deal with psychos.
I put them away.

70
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,920
I ain't no psycho, man.

71
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,720
I'm a hero!

72
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,440
You're looking at a fucking hunter.

73
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,480
I'm a hero of the New World.

74
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,680
You're a disease, and I'm the cure.

75
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,080
Die!

76
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
Drop it!

77
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,080
Come on.

78
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,280
You okay, man?

79
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,600
You're the one
who killed the maniac?

80
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,800
Did he say why he did it?
ls it related to the Night Slasher?

81
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,600
The Night Slasher's a different case.
People, please!

82
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,120
Let's have a little room!

83
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,680
Was it necessary for it to end
like this? Did he have to die?

84
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,320
Come on, don't listen to this asshole.

85
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,800
Did you use unnecessary deadly force?

86
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,640
I used everything I had.

87
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,680
Is this a public forum?
We have work to do out here!

88
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,840
We want to know what makes a policeman
a judge and jury. People have rights.

89
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,840
You think a maniac who blew a kid's
heart out should have rights?

90
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,400
No matter what you think, people
are entitled to protection by the law.

91
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,840
You tell that to his family!

92
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,320
All right, the show's over.
Come on, clear this area!

93
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,800
-Move it!
-Fuck you!

94
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,480
What's your problem?

95
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,360
What's your problema, ese ?
You touched my car, man.

96
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,560
That's bad for your health.

97
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,760
What is, pinche ?

98
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,880
Me.

99
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,880
Clean up your act.

100
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,120
Yeah! You're in trouble, man.

101
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,680
You told him, ese.

102
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,680
Tonight, the man known as
the Night Slasher...

103
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,520
...has struck for the 16th time
in just over a month 's time.

104
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,000
The 22-year-old victim was
mutilated with a sharp instrument...

105
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,880
...and seemed to be just as unlikely
a victim as the other 15.

106
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,400
Not much else is known other than that
the Night Slasher preys upon anyone.

107
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,480
Victims have included businessmen,
Asian immigrants...

108
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,480
... the elderly and, in one case,
a sexually assaulted child.

109
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,520
The serial killer has thrown
the city into a panic...

110
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,840
...and up until now, no one
has had a clue to his identity.

111
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,360
The killer has been known
to cra wl through windows...

112
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,640
...and kill the victims in their sleep.

113
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,560
The method of death has been
silent instruments...

114
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,240
...such as cla w hammers,
knives and axes.

115
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,360
Cuts are straight, long, deep,
just like the others.

116
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,600
That brings the count to 1 6, and still
this bastard shows no distinct pattern.

117
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,440
Maybe there's more than one.

118
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,920
Look, this is not your specialty, okay?

119
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,040
This is pure investigative work. . .

120
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,520
. . .not jumping out a window.

121
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,600
-We need to beef up the task force.
-We need interagency cooperation.

122
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,520
Every department wants to be
the hero in this case!

123
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,880
I don't want to be a hero.
I just want to get involved.

124
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,920
If I may, captain. . .?

125
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,160
If we let Cobretti use his tactics,
we're asking for trouble.

126
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,680
What are you saying?

127
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,600
-He should stay on the zombie squad.
-You're telling me where to stay?

128
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,640
It's nothing personal.
We're just different kinds of cops.

129
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,520
Like Monte says, you're a specialist
who does a job nobody wants.

130
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,840
But we can't shake people down.
Internal Affairs will jump on us.

131
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,720
-Then we lost.
-Lost?

132
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,200
As long as we play by these bullshit
rules and the killer doesn't, we lose.

133
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,960
-What do you want to do?
-Nothing we can do, except wait.

134
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,280
For what?

135
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,040
For it to happen again.

136
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,120
I'm, like, really sorry.
Do you think there's, like, any damage?

137
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,640
How could you have hit me?
Have you been drinking or something?

138
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,600
Yes.

139
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,080
Get the license plate!

140
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,080
Come on!

141
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,760
He's daring us to catch him.

142
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,680
-We dig in and find that lead.
-Forget it.

143
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,920
Forget it?
What options do we have?

144
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,520
Call the bastard.

145
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,720
Metro Police. Can I help you?

146
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,120
Gentlemen.

147
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,960
Captain.

148
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,040
I won't waste any time.

149
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,760
You know almost every sicko
in this city. Shake them down.

150
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,880
Do what you have to do
to get a lead.

151
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,400
If I find him?

152
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,920
Do what you do best.

153
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,200
And try not to waste the wrong guy.

154
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,120
But then again. . .

155
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,920
. . .what do you care, right?

156
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,760
You know, when this is over. . .

157
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:31,760
. . .I'd like to celebrate by
punching a hole in Monte's chest.

158
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,960
You know what the trouble
with you is?

159
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,640
You're too violent.

160
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,160
It's all that sugar you eat.

161
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,520
-This is the first sugar today.
-It's that junk food.

162
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,680
Bullshit!

163
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,480
Try prunes, something natural.
Raisins.

164
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,120
Try fish.
Fish and rice. Very good.

165
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,120
Fish and rice!

166
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,800
-I'll take it from here.
-Sure?

167
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,400
No problem.
Her car's right over there.

168
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,960
You're in good hands.
Good night.

169
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,440
Listen, I still think if you wanted to,
you could be doing a lot bigger layouts.

170
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,000
I mean it's up to you,
but I could help.

171
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,280
I don't want to have
to play these games.

172
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,520
-Games? What games?
-You know what games!

173
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,280
I'd be sick not to want
to sleep with you.

174
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,600
Then don't do it for me.
Do it for your career.

175
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,120
Did you hear something?

176
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,840
It's not like I'm
asking you to marry me.

177
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,080
I see it will take time
to make you change your mind.

178
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,200
-So where do you want to eat?
-Please, Dan, I'm not hungry!

179
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,600
I'm not doing this for me, really.

180
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,560
Look, I'm just trying
to help you find happiness.

181
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,440
I forgot my bag.

182
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,960
You see?
You do need me.

183
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,360
Please! Come on!
My God!

184
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,160
Leave me alone!

185
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,080
They're trying to kill me!

186
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,600
Get back!

187
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,840
Kill her.

188
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:04,960
Doctor Dorson,
please call nurses ' station 4 West.

189
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,880
How long before that kicks in?

190
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,280
I don't want to sleep.

191
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,680
It won't make you sleep.
It will just calm you down.

192
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,320
Now, I'll be back when you're finished.

193
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,440
Hi.

194
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,760
Is it "Ka-nudsen"? Ka?

195
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,960
That's what I thought.

196
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,120
I am Sergeant Gonzales. . .

197
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,320
. . .and that intense-looking gentleman
behind you is Lieutenant Cobretti.

198
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,960
We're a pair of really nice guys. . .

199
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,560
. . .who are here to ask you
a lot of bad questions.

200
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,240
Is that all right?

201
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,720
You don't look like policemen.

202
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,560
No?

203
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,280
You're kidding?
She must mean you.

204
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,760
No, we are.
We're the real thing.

205
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,960
I don't understand
how this happened to me.

206
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,240
Why don't you take a minute?
Think about it.

207
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,600
-Did you have a fight with anyone?
-No.

208
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,480
You owe money to anybody?

209
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,720
You been around drugs,
people who deal drugs?

210
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,120
Never. No.

211
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,440
That's nice.

212
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,160
So in the last few weeks,
there hasn't been anything?

213
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,160
No threats of any kind?

214
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,560
No.

215
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,080
There was this guy who
scared me a little tonight.

216
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,360
Who?

217
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,080
I don't know who he was.

218
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,600
Some guy broke down by the underpass.

219
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,360
I just drove away.

220
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,200
What time were you there?

221
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,320
Maybe 1 0:00.

222
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,360
He scared you. Why?
What was he doing?

223
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,640
It was just the way he looked at me.

224
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,720
What else did you see?
Did you see anything else?

225
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,480
Yeah, there was another car
in front of them.

226
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,360
Them?

227
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,720
I think there was three of them.

228
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,960
You think you would recognize him
if you saw him again?

229
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,680
The tall one?

230
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,760
Yeah, the one that wants to kill you.

231
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,440
She knows your face.

232
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,760
I know where she is.

233
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,560
Let me get her for you.

234
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,400
She's mine.

235
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,200
You done, Fred?

236
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,360
Cute guy.

237
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,400
So, what do you think?

238
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,120
It looks a little like him.

239
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,360
You can't describe the other two?

240
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,880
No, it was too dark.

241
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,520
-Want to run prints at headquarters?
-I'll take care of it. Thanks.

242
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,280
Tonight, you'll stay here. Tomorrow,
we'll move you to a safe house.

243
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,880
Why do I have to stay around this?
I want to go.

244
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,760
You're the one who can place him
at the crime scene.

245
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,040
Until we get him,
it's got to be that way.

246
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,120
Tony, you hungry?

247
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,360
What do you got?

248
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,920
Something that looks like cheese.

249
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,120
No, there's some cake over there.

250
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,720
-Take the cheese.
-I don't want the cheese.

251
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,680
-I saw some cake.
-You're done with this, aren't you?

252
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,240
Yes.

253
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,640
All right, take the cake.
But save it, okay?

254
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,240
She's going to wreck our New World.

255
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,080
And the dream.

256
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,840
You have to stop her.

257
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,000
Great-looking guy, huh?

258
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,960
Do you have that upside-down?

259
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,440
No, he's just a regular dirtbag.

260
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,840
I want to go to my place
and check this out against my files.

261
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,040
I'll be back in a couple of hours, okay?

262
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,960
There's a real nice-looking lady, huh?
Wasn't she?

263
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,920
-The one upstairs?
-The one upstairs. You remember?

264
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,560
I didn't notice, Gonzales.
I was on the job.

265
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,320
-I was paying attention to business.
-Me too.

266
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,760
Good night, all right?

267
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Fucking liar!

268
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,560
-Watch your mouth. You're in public.
-Of course.

269
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,200
You're a good citizen.

270
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,240
You can't buy a damn thing
that's worth a--

271
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,600
You men are supposed to use
the service elevator.

272
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,280
Next time, use the stairs.

273
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:24,760
Remember the health code.
Next time take the stairs.

274
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,120
A little late to be mopping up.

275
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,360
You want me to say something?

276
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,640
No, I've got to do my rounds.
I'll tell him.

277
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,360
See you next break.

278
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,400
Hey, I'm in your office.
What do you need me for?

279
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,600
Why are you there?

280
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,840
Headquarters said
you wanted me here.

281
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,160
Get back to the hospital!

282
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,640
Presley!

283
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,280
Pretty hair!

284
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,680
Why are you doing this to me?

285
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,560
Stop this right now!
Stop doing this to me!

286
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,040
Is anybody here?

287
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,200
Please remain calm.

288
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,040
All exits from the hospital
are clearly marked.

289
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,680
Please use the stairs and
proceed in an orderly manner.

290
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,840
Do not run.

291
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,920
You almost got everyone killed.

292
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,520
-Now maybe you'll do it right.
-They've got somebody inside.

293
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,720
Smart accusation, Cobretti.
Can you prove it?

294
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,960
Chief Halliwell wants an answer.

295
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,840
Not yet.

296
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,760
I know what we're dealing with.

297
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,880
Don't make things
harder than they are.

298
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,240
Monte says you've got
a sketch of the suspect.

299
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,760
Is this a game?

300
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,640
He didn't say the magic word.

301
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,960
What magic word?

302
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,760
Please.

303
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,440
All right, enough of this bullshit.
Do you understand?

304
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,800
You bet.

305
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,440
That's it?

306
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,000
That's it.

307
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,840
Cobretti, do you know
you have an attitude problem?

308
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,720
Yeah, but it's just a little one.

309
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,760
-He's going to get me, isn't he?
-No, he won't.

310
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,280
How can you say that?
You said I'll be safe here.

311
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,600
Who is he?

312
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,880
We don't know yet.

313
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,440
Come on, it's moving time.

314
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,360
This is Officer Stalk.
She's assigned to this case.

315
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,160
-So let's go, guys.
-Where?

316
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,960
We're going to a safe house.

317
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,400
Want help with this?

318
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,280
-Want a bite?
-No.

319
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,200
Don't you like health food?

320
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,000
Did you notice
anything out of the ordinary?

321
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,400
Did anybody challenge you?

322
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:43,520
If you remember anything, let us know.
I appreciate your help.

323
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,720
You've got to tell me
what happened here.

324
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,280
I told you to let my team
handle this, understand?

325
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,760
Of course you don't.
Listen, hotshot.

326
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,360
-We want him just as much as you do.
-Do you?

327
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:59,160
There were 3 men assigned to that room.
Headquarters called to take 2 off. Why?

328
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:03,520
-Headquarters didn't do anything.
-No? Then who did?

329
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,200
It's your show.
You find out.

330
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,080
Where's Gonzales?

331
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:27,960
Buckle up!

332
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,800
He's crazy! He's crazy!

333
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:43,800
Go!

334
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:54,840
Watch out!

335
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,560
Get down!

336
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,160
It's so out of control.
Where do I start?

337
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,640
With the legal problems.

338
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:57,480
Of course we have legal problems.
The city's become one big battlefield.

339
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,720
The public will be screaming
for federal assistance.

340
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,520
I don't want FBI in here!

341
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:06,360
We've got enough manpower to handle it,
so why can't we control this?

342
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:10,520
Because we're against an army of
killers. I keep telling you guys that.

343
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,760
-How do you know?
-I know, all right?

344
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,240
-This army theory sounds weak.
-Does it really?

345
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,040
What have you got, besides one scared
woman, to back up anything you say?

346
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:24,280
And your idea of taking her out of
the city for protection is ridiculous.

347
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,200
The security is here.

348
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:29,520
Maybe she'll be safer here,
where we can keep an eye on her.

349
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,200
-It won't work.
-Why not?

350
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,320
We're dealing with fanatics
who'll do anything to waste her!

351
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,960
Excuse me, but I've got
to say what I think.

352
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:40,240
And I think this whole
sorry ordeal is like some. . .

353
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,240
. . .damn sick joke, if you ask me.

354
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,080
Nobody asked you, Monte.

355
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,040
That's just too bad, isn't it?

356
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,880
He doesn't give a rat's ass for
this girl. She's just live bait. . .

357
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,240
. . .so King Cobretti here
can cut a new notch.

358
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,720
You've already caused
a lot of people to die.

359
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,680
How about letting her live?

360
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,120
Enough!

361
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,120
Next time.

362
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,200
He's the psycho!

363
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,760
What do we want to do?

364
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,080
If he thinks those psychos
will follow her, let him go.

365
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,720
At least we got them out of the city.

366
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,440
-You all right?
-Yeah.

367
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,760
Are your men out there?

368
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,440
Yeah, they're out there.

369
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:00,800
Are we just supposed to drive around
until he tries to kill us again?

370
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,200
No, they won't get you.

371
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,280
You keep saying that.
How do you know that for sure?

372
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,720
You got to have faith.

373
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,680
Can I ask you something?

374
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,320
Sure, what's that?

375
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,800
Why were you fighting
with the other police?

376
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:48,480
Sometimes they don't buy what I believe.

377
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,120
There's all these
crazy people everywhere.

378
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:55,600
Why can't the police just
put them away and keep them away?

379
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,000
Hey, tell it to the judge.

380
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,040
What do you mean?

381
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:02,080
We put them away.
They let them out.

382
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,920
It makes me sick!

383
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:09,080
Like I said, you got to
tell it to the judge.

384
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,200
Great day for junk food, babe.

385
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,840
Why don't you add meat to your diet?

386
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,960
No, thanks. I hate frog legs.

387
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,800
You want?

388
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,600
Thank you.

389
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,200
Fellow garbage-belly.

390
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,120
So how you doing?

391
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,560
All right. What about you?

392
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,920
Not bad.

393
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,240
Where are we going?

394
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:59,000
You're going to have to ask Cobra.
He's the expert on this.

395
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,440
He doesn't look like an expert, does he?

396
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:06,080
I know. He looks like
a fugitive from the '50s. . .

397
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,480
. . .but he sure is great
at catching psychos.

398
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,880
He's the pride of the zombie squad.

399
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:12,760
What's the zombie squad?

400
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,000
The bottom line.

401
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,280
Want to have some fun?

402
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,600
It's kind of personal. . .

403
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,760
. . .but it might cheer him up.

404
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,480
Walk up to him. . .

405
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,240
. . .and call him. . . .

406
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,680
He likes that.

407
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,440
Hot item.

408
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,160
Did you find out anything new?

409
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,120
Since you were in the bathroom?
No, not really.

410
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,120
I did.

411
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,480
Like what?

412
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,160
Marion Cobretti.

413
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,800
Is that really your name?

414
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,600
Gonzales talks too much, doesn't he?

415
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,560
It's not so bad.

416
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,520
It's kind of tough growing up with.

417
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,080
-I like it.
-Do you?

418
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,680
I always wanted to have
a tougher one myself.

419
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,560
You know, a little harder name.

420
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:09,960
Like what?

421
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:11,720
Alice.

422
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,280
We'd better get going.

423
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,120
Sorry, no sale.

424
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,480
Your entree is ready.

425
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,800
It's for the large family.

426
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,800
It sure is.

427
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,800
You have a life preserver?

428
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:43,520
Why?

429
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,120
Because your french fries
are drowning there.

430
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,280
What is this place?

431
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,800
It's a foundry town.

432
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,680
Tell me something:

433
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,160
Do you ever let go?

434
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,280
Sure.

435
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,000
Really?

436
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,320
So what do you do to relax?

437
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,040
Look for trouble.

438
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:09,880
No, I mean. . .

439
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,840
. . .do you ever get involved?

440
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:13,560
With a woman?

441
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,760
Yeah, a woman.

442
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,200
A real woman?
A real live woman?

443
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,080
I don't know.
Now and then. Nothing regular.

444
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,240
Why?

445
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,000
Let's just say that. . .

446
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:29,080
. . .not many people could
put up with the way I live.

447
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,880
What if you found one?

448
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,680
I'd say she'd have to be
a little crazy.

449
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,720
I've got to go.

450
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,000
You scared me.

451
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:50,920
Where's Tony?

452
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:54,600
He's asleep. I was just
checking on things at home.

453
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,600
Why not use the phone in your room?

454
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
It's out of order.

455
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:03,160
-It's getting cold out here, huh?
-Yeah. Better get inside.

456
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:07,800
Maybe it doesn't mean much,
but I think you're doing a great job.

457
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:08,960
You too.

458
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,440
Can't you sleep?

459
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,480
Not really.

460
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:30,880
You should try.

461
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,240
-I can still hear.
-What?

462
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:41,640
That your eyes are open.

463
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,320
Who can sleep?

464
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,800
Would you come over here, please?

465
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,880
I won't hurt you.

466
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,440
Sure, why not?

467
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:09,240
Yeah, I guess I'll be pretty safe.

468
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,360
Where will you go
when this is all done?

469
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,320
I don't know. Maybe another case.

470
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,960
We'll see each other some more
when this is over, right?

471
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,920
You think that's a good idea?

472
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,160
I think it might be.

473
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,040
I'll go check the window.

474
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:57,280
I think it might be a very good idea.

475
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,160
Morning.

476
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,400
Hi.

477
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:23,560
Where we going today?

478
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,480
Further upstate.

479
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:28,440
We better check on Stalk,
see why she isn't out here.

480
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,440
Better get in the car.

481
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:32,480
What's wrong?
You look so mad.

482
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,960
I always look this way
before breakfast.

483
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,840
-She's gone, man.
-What?

484
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,120
Gone.

485
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:42,280
Get inside.

486
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:45,720
Get inside!

487
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:55,880
Never liked that bitch.

488
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:57,480
Me either.

489
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,240
Get in the house.

490
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:03,840
Get down over there.

491
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:40,720
Come on!

492
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,240
Tony!

493
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:28,880
What do I do?

494
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:32,080
Go through it!

495
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,200
Keep going!

496
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:54,120
Come on, let's go!

497
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:18,880
Go to the foundry.

498
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,880
You have the right to remain silent.

499
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:21,840
Die, bitch!

500
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,120
Get out of there!

501
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:35,280
Let's bleed, pig!

502
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:38,120
Where are you?

503
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:45,560
I want your eyes, pig!

504
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:48,080
I want them!

505
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:50,840
You want to go to hell?

506
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:57,720
You want to go to hell with me?

507
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,720
It doesn't matter, does it?

508
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:03,560
We are the hunters.

509
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:05,400
We kill the weak. . .

510
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,440
. . .so the strong survive.

511
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:10,320
You can't stop the New World.

512
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:13,640
Your filthy society will never
get rid of people like us.

513
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:16,400
It's breeding them.

514
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:18,280
We are the future!

515
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:23,280
You're history.

516
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:28,320
You won't do it, pig.

517
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:30,640
You won't shoot.

518
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:34,440
Murder is against the law.

519
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,520
You have to take me in.

520
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:40,600
If. . .

521
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:42,200
. . .you can.

522
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:46,280
Even I have rights. . .

523
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,520
. . .don't l. . .

524
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:50,240
. . .pig?

525
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:53,440
Take me in.

526
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:56,760
They'll say I'm insane.

527
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,320
Won't they?

528
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,880
The court is civilized. . .

529
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:04,680
. . .isn't it. . .

530
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:06,120
. . .pig?

531
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,440
But I'm not.

532
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,920
This is where the law stops. . .

533
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:14,360
. . .and I start. . .

534
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:18,000
. . .sucker!

535
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:42,600
Come on, pig.

536
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,360
You okay?

537
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:06,800
You sure?

538
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,240
Let's get out of here.

539
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:25,760
Come on, you did your best.
Don't feel guilty.

540
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:29,560
That's nice of you.
You going to be all right?

541
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:32,280
I'm going to miss the dance finals.

542
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:35,240
Listen, can I get you anything?

543
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:36,640
Yeah.

544
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:39,120
I would kill for some. . . .

545
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:40,720
What?

546
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:42,600
Gummy Bears.

547
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:44,080
Gummy Bears?

548
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:48,160
See you at the hospital.

549
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:51,000
-Keep in touch.
-Don't drive too fast.

550
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:01,720
You did a hell of a job here.

551
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:05,320
You ever want a transfer
to something easier. . .

552
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:06,840
. . .or you need anything. . .

553
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:08,520
. . .just say the word.

554
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:13,400
I would like to have my car replaced.

555
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:17,040
We'd like to,
but it's not in the budget.

556
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:22,760
See you back at headquarters.
I'll take care of your toy for you.

557
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:29,920
No hard feelings.

558
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,160
You kind of overdid it around here.

559
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,160
I personally would have. . .

560
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:38,440
. . .a more subtle solution,
but that's not your style.

561
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,600
No hard feelings.

562
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:56,560
No hard feelings, pal.

563
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:03,400
I'll give you a lift.

564
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:05,960
No, I've got my own
transportation, thanks.

565
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:07,560
You ready?

566
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,640
Ready, Marion.

567
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:12,400
Catchy name, isn't it?

568
01:19:13,305 --> 01:19:19,309
