Mrs. Levine is day five
post-cholecystectomy.

10
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,300
She remains afebrile and her previous
anorexia is gone, draining well.

11
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,900
An AP chest film is clear.
Her white count is nine-four.

12
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,500
BUN has stabilized at 40.2,
good output of 1 600cc's.

13
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,600
-Blood cultures?
-No growth times two.

14
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,300
Well, Harris can't nail us on this one.

15
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,600
Next case.

16
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,400
-lt was a long time ago.
-And is he good?

17
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,900
Yeah, he can really break it up!

18
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,600
Billy's weird.

19
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,400
He gets so tired.

20
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,100
Do you like this lipstick?

21
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,600
She was terrific.

22
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,600
lt's 32 now and going fast.

23
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,300
He can't afford to get out.

24
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,800
l got a thousand shares of that.

25
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,200
We have to have the AP, lateral and
1 0 units done before they can begin.

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,100
lt says here, type and cross-match
was done yesterday.

27
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,700
Just standard workup procedure.

28
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,000
Well, l don't know.

29
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,700
So it was a clear case of endocarditis.

30
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,200
We're ready when you are,
Dr. Wheeler.

31
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,700
No response to antibiotics.

32
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,200
Cut her, okay?

33
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,800
-Sponge.
-Begin to tie off.

34
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,000
<i>It's all politics.</i>
<i>Today, for instance...</i>

35
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,000
...Rudnick says to me, ''l hear you're
the new chief resident in surgery.''

36
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,800
-That's great!
-He was testing me.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,100
Then he says that Harris told him...

38
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,600
...that Mark Bellows was going to be
the next chief resident.

39
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,000
-Wonderful, Mark.
-But here's the thing.

40
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,200
He waited for me to say l knew
about it. That wouldn't look right.

41
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,400
That would look as if l expected it.
So l said l hadn't heard anything.

42
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,900
You've wanted it for two years.

43
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,000
But there's no point
in saying that, is there?

44
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,400
l said...

45
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,400
...l thought it'd be wonderful
if it happened.

46
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,700
l said Chandler was doing
an excellent job as chief resident.

47
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,200
But l said there was a little room
left for improvement.

48
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,200
Chandler's damn good.

49
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,600
l really laid it on thick
with old Rudnick.

50
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,400
l told him l was following his hepatic
research, cited some references.

51
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,200
He was impressed.

52
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,600
Procedure went well too.

53
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,300
So all in all, it was a good day.

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,600
l'm gonna take a shower.
Can you grab me a beer before dinner?

55
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,100
Hey, Mark.

56
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,400
Get your own beer.

57
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,900
-Honey, for chrissakes, come on.
-l want to take a shower.

58
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,400
-l was on call last night.
-So was l.

59
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,300
l know, but l had two arrests...

60
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,600
...aortic aneurysm blew at 4 a.m.,
had to be done stat.

61
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,500
So l didn't get any sleep, and
l'd really like to take a shower.

62
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,800
lf you don't mind.

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,700
l had a hard day too.

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,800
You get in the shower faster
than any person alive.

65
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,300
Have a beer.
You'll feel better.

66
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,900
l know what'd make me feel better.

67
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,100
Goddamn doctors.

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,500
Couldn't have fallen
in love with a nurse.

69
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,600
Dorothy on the eighth floor.

70
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,200
She liked me.

71
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,500
My own apartment.

72
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,400
Did you hear about Louis?

73
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,800
What about Louis?

74
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,700
They passed him up
as assistant professor.

75
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,200
Guy's really paid his dues too.
Now they don't take him.

76
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,500
Plus his son is waiting
for a kidney transplant.

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,500
Did you start dinner?

78
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,100
What?

79
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,500
Did you start dinner?

80
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:29,400
-Did you hear anything l said?
-lt's in the fridge. Just heat it up.

81
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,800
-l was telling you about my day.
-l had a hard day too.

82
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,500
Just go heat it up.

83
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,500
Why is it, whenever we're about
to fight, you're always undressed?

84
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,500
What's the big deal?
Just heat up the stew.

85
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,500
-Why won't you help out?
-ls that the way you see it?

86
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,400
l make my concessions.
You always take a shower first.

87
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,500
l don't.

88
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,200
You do too,
and l'm getting tired of it.

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Honey, come on.

90
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,000
Don't call me honey.

91
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,800
l'm trying to tell you about my day.
Something that happened.

92
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,500
Your days are always the same.

93
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,200
What is that supposed to mean?

94
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,300
Just politics, that's all.

95
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,500
Who said what to whom.
Who's rising, who's falling.

96
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,300
Who's made a good move, a bad move.
Politics!

97
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,400
Somebody has to be interested
in hospital politics.

98
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,700
You certainly are not.

99
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,100
l thought you were a surgical
resident, not a political one.

100
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,300
l like politics.

101
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,700
They interest me. Just because
you're always looking for--

102
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,400
You want me to heat up
the dinner, is that it?

103
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,700
l want some respect.

104
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,300
Susan, come on.
Don't leave again.

105
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,900
Why can't you share
half the responsibility?

106
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,300
l share more than
half the responsibility!

107
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,700
-No need to shout.
-Why are you running off?

108
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,800
You think l want this?
Let me tell you something.

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,500
l make concessions
for this so-called relationship.

110
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,500
l know it's hard on you politically.

111
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,600
Susan, don't go.

112
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,100
You know what the trouble with you is?

113
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,700
All you care about
is being chief resident.

114
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,400
You know what your trouble is?
You don't want a relationship.

115
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,900
Look at you.
You run away from it.

116
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,700
This is ridiculous.

117
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,000
You don't want a lover...

118
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,200
...you want a goddamn wife!

119
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,300
Bastard.

120
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,100
l have a bleeder here.

121
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,800
-l need more suction.
-Clamp.

122
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,800
He's not di-toxic.
He has advanced ASHD.

123
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,400
l just bought some at 43.

124
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,100
Yeah, l hear they have management
problems. l sold at 37.

125
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,500
How are you?

126
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,800
l'm fine. The case went well.
No problem.

127
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,300
Good.

128
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,500
l'm really sorry about last night.

129
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,300
So am l.

130
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,200
-You want to have some lunch?
-l have class.

131
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,200
You don't think this is
more important than the class?

132
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,200
That class is the only time
l get out of this damn hospital.

133
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,100
Can you understand that?
lt's important to me!

134
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,200
You're impossible!

135
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,600
Seven, eight, step!

136
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,000
Back. Step.

137
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,300
Out!

138
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,800
One, two, down three,
up four and open.

139
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,200
And one and two,
three and four.

140
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,900
Stretch.

141
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,500
Walk two, three, four...

142
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,200
...and five and six, seven,
eight and back.

143
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,300
-You gonna leave Mark?
-l don't know.

144
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,700
l went home last night.

145
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,400
Again?

146
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,500
He's impossible.

147
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,400
Did you see Dr. Richards?

148
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,300
l don't know.

149
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,800
Apparently you can tell by looking at
the cervix. lt's a different color.

150
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,900
He did the lab tests and he says
l'm definitely 8 to 1 0 weeks pregnant.

151
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,500
So Dr. Richards is doing
a D and C tomorrow.

152
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,500
For menstrual irregularity.

153
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
lt's simple, isn't it?

154
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,800
Are you worried?

155
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,100
l know you do this every day but, sure,
l'm worried. Who wouldn't be?

156
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,800
lt'll be fine, Nancy.
lt's routine procedure.

157
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,600
We're going to the lce Capades.

158
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,400
lt's real crowded.

159
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,600
Patient on call?

160
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,400
-Coming right down, Dr. Cowans.
-The instruments are autoclaved.

161
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,300
Let's teach you fellas
some anesthesiology.

162
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,100
This is your standard anesthesia.

163
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:41,800
You've got two main wall lines.
Nitrous oxide on the left and oxygen.

164
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,300
We got a case today that's a D and C.

165
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,800
lt's one of Dr. Richard's cases.
Actually, it's a TAB.

166
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,500
That's a therapeutic abortion.
Keep it clean. lt's a married patient.

167
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,600
On the cart here,
we got two manometers...

168
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,000
...with flow valves here and here
to regulate gas.

169
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,500
We got emergency oxygen down here...

170
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,300
...which we checked and that's full.

171
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,000
During surgery, we'll be recording this
and the vital signs.

172
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,400
Hey, how is Bess?

173
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,800
l don't know.

174
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,400
ln and out.

175
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,400
Boy, she has more rails
than anybody l know.

176
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,900
She's seeing a shrink now.

177
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,800
One, two, three, up!

178
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,800
Anybody we know?

179
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,900
Morning, Nancy. Remember me?
l'm Dr. Cowans.

180
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,900
That's right, dear,
and you'll have a nice long sleep.

181
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,400
Pre-op, she's received a 0.0 1
of Demerol and 0.4 of atropine...

182
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,900
...so believe me,
she's pretty relaxed.

183
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,700
l'll say she's relaxed!
Come on, Mrs. Greenly, on your back.

184
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,200
That's it.

185
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,000
-Gonna meet me for lunch?
-l don't know.

186
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,900
l'll let you know, okay?

187
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,700
l'll be in the lounge.

188
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,100
Henry might be calling,
and if he does, you know....

189
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,200
-Okay, no problem.
-Yeah, okay.

190
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,000
-Good afternoon, Tom.
-Afternoon, Jim. How's our lady?

191
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,100
Just about ready.

192
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,800
l'm still awake.

193
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,300
-But not for long, dear.
-You promise?

194
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,600
l'll induce with sodium Pentothal,
give an lV by syringe.

195
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,400
Nance, what l want you to do...

196
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,300
...is start counting from 1 00
backwards real slow, okay?

197
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,400
Here we go.

198
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,700
-A hundred.
-Ninety-nine...

199
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,200
...ninety-eight...

200
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,000
...ninety-seven...

201
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,600
...ninety-six....

202
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,800
lt's quick. Stop the pentothal.

203
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,400
You see, pentothal isn't
really an anesthetic.

204
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,300
Any deep pain right now
and she'd wake right up.

205
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,300
What we need for anesthesia is gas.

206
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,900
First l'll inject some succinylcholine.

207
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,100
l want you to watch her chest gauge
because she'll stop breathing.

208
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,300
She's now experiencing
complete muscular paralysis.

209
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,600
She's got three minutes
to breathe or she'll suffocate.

210
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,600
So now we intubate.

211
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,400
Taking a laryngoscope like so.

212
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,600
Hold her head
in an extended position.

213
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,300
Enter laterally, put up
the base of the tongue, up and out...

214
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,100
...visualizing the trachea.

215
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,700
There it is, fellas. Take a look.

216
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,200
You see it?
lt's right over there.

217
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,600
Come on, guys!

218
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,200
Take our tube and enter here.

219
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,000
ln the middle of surgery,
l'll switch over to the telothane.

220
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,100
Stirrups up?

221
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,100
How is John?

222
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,900
His fever broke today.
He'll go back to school tomorrow.

223
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,000
Now we can check
the pupillary reflexes.

224
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,700
Though she's unconscious,
the pupils should react to light...

225
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,300
...and let us know
that the old brain is okay.

226
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,300
That's it. Anesthesia's the easiest job
in the world until something goes wrong.

227
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,900
lt's 99% boredom
and 1 % scared-shitless panic...

228
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,300
...which we try to avoid.
The patient's yours, Dr. Richards.

229
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,200
lf you move in behind me...

230
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,600
...you'll see what l am going to do
for this young woman.

231
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,800
Some music, please.

232
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,400
Actually, what l'm going to do
is get her out of a hell of a mess.

233
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,400
She's pregnant.

234
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,000
She doesn't want her husband to know.

235
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,300
lt's none of my business.

236
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,700
l'm just her surgeon.
l don't run her life.

237
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,500
So in fact, our task is simplified...

238
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,400
...when the uterus is
anteverted and anteflexed.

239
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,500
This is a function of the muscular
attachments, of which there are five.

240
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,800
You should know them.

241
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,500
They're the broad ligaments,
the round and cardinal ligaments...

242
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,100
...and the endopelvic fascia,
the uterosacral ligaments.

243
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,700
Something wrong?

244
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
She just threw a PVC,
and her blood pressure's falling.

245
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,400
l got 90 over 60.

246
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,700
She's fully oxygenated.
Red as a cherry down here.

247
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,100
How much longer you got?

248
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,900
Just a couple of minutes.

249
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,600
l don't like this.
Her blood pressure is still falling.

250
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,800
Damn!

251
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,700
We should stop. She may be getting
too much vagal stimulation.

252
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,300
Jesus Christ.

253
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,400
What's the matter?

254
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,900
l don't know.
Nothing's the matter!

255
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,300
Something's the matter.
She's going to arrest!

256
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,400
l can't find anything!

257
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,300
l get a 1 00 over 80.
Her pressure's climbing.

258
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,200
Let's finish up. l'd like to get
this mother off the table.

259
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,500
Sponge, please.

260
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,000
One-twenty over 80 and climbing.
She's okay.

261
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,500
-These tissues can go to pathology.
-Can l start bringing her out?

262
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,200
Yeah, bring her out, Jim.

263
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,300
Okay, Mrs. Greenly,
it's time to wake up.

264
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,000
Okay, Nancy?

265
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,900
Mrs. Greenly? Wake up.

266
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,100
Nance, can you give me
a cough, please?

267
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:44,000
Jesus Christ!
Her pupils are fixed and dilated.

268
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,500
The pupils, they're fixed.

269
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,600
Dilated.

270
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,800
Oh, my God!

271
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:00,200
Pre-op diagnosis,
acute gastric ulceration.

272
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,800
Post-op diagnosis, the same.

273
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,900
Surgeon, Dr. Wilson.

274
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,300
-Where's Schwartz? Cholecystectomy?
-Bed three.

275
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,800
-Mr. Schwartz, l'm Dr. Bellows.
-You don't got to talk so loud.

276
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,200
How you feel?

277
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,500
Just ''eh''?

278
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,300
You want to get on your side
for me, please?

279
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,200
-On your side.
-Speak up, l can't hear you.

280
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,000
What'd they give you
in that operating room?

281
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,500
Do you have any pain?

282
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,000
lf l had any pain,
l would go see a doctor.

283
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,000
Now you want to breathe
for me real easy?

284
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,600
That's it. Slowly.

285
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,200
She was given narceine
to rule out pre-op narcotic....

286
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,500
Easy!

287
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,600
Two units without effect,
a few peripheral fasciculations.

288
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,500
So it's not succinylcholine?

289
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,900
Delayed return of consciousness
of cryptogenic origin.

290
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,000
l see no reason not to transfer her
to the intensive care unit.

291
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,500
Mr. Schwartz, you're going to be fine.

292
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,400
That's what you think!

293
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,200
-A grim prognosis, to say the least.
-Rather tragic.

294
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,300
Someone should notify Dr. George.

295
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,800
He'll want to review
the anesthetic protocol.

296
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Right, he's been paged.

297
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,300
Looks like
another anesthetic reaction.

298
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,400
Page Dr. Bendix.
4-4-4-3-2.

299
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,500
Check.

300
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,600
George is not here.

301
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,900
No, Dr. Bendix. Bendix!

302
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,800
Maybe he left the hospital.
Try his office.

303
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,400
Could you page Dr. Wheeler, please?

304
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,900
So you see, Jimmy,
your kidneys are sick.

305
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,300
They don't work right.

306
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,000
We need to take out the sick kidneys
and put in a new one.

307
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,100
Today?

308
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,200
No, not today.
We have to wait until...

309
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,500
...there's a kidney we can put in.

310
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,600
Tomorrow?

311
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,100
l don't know when.
But it could be a while.

312
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,000
<i>Dr. Wheeler, call extension 3-5-6.</i>

313
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,200
You can have one of these.
Which color do you like?

314
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,100
Purple.

315
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,700
Take two.

316
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,800
l like purple.

317
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,300
l can see that.

318
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,700
l like red too.

319
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,800
Dr. Wheeler.

320
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,800
Excuse me, l have to go
to intensive care now.

321
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,800
A nurse should be right in.

322
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,300
Surgical lCU.

323
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,900
What's her status?

324
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,200
Greenly?

325
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
Complete squash rot.

326
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,200
She's a total Gomer.

327
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,600
lt's brain death.

328
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,400
That patient was transferred
to the Jefferson lnstitute yesterday.

329
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
How can this happen?

330
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,800
All this....

331
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,000
Did you do an EEG?

332
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,600
Flat.

333
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,100
Completely flat?

334
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,200
Completely flat.

335
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,700
Did you repeat it?

336
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,400
No, not yet.

337
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,900
What happened during the D and C?

338
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,000
Nothing.

339
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,100
lt's an unremarkable case,
according to the notes.

340
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,500
Transient PVCs late in the operation.

341
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,400
Nothing else.

342
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,900
She never woke up?

343
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,700
l want to look at her chart.

344
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,200
lf it were my friend,
l don't know if l'd be that cool.

345
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,900
The potassium was what?

346
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,300
One-eight? Are you sure?

347
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,300
lt must be a mistake.

348
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,600
Honey, l'm sorry.

349
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,900
l know you two were really close.

350
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,900
Susan?

351
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,400
There doesn't seem to be
anything unusual in the chart.

352
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,000
Normal 28-year-old patient
in good health for a D and C...

353
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,900
...underwent telothane anesthesia,
comes out in irreversible coma.

354
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
lt's well-documented
that telothane causes liver damage...

355
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,700
...and severe side effects in
a small percentage of surgical cases.

356
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,800
-That's just the risk of anesthesia.
-l know you're upset.

357
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,100
l'm not upset.

358
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,100
You think because l'm a woman,
l'm going to be upset. l'm fine.

359
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,500
l want to understand the variables
as they apply to this patient.

360
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,500
l'm sure you agree that's indicated.

361
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,600
''This patient''?

362
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,600
Here we have an ordinary,
uninteresting case...

363
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:10,400
...of surgical reaction to telothane
anesthesia in a healthy patient.

364
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,500
As far as l can tell,
there are no unusual aspects...

365
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,800
...except that the patient
was tissue-typed.

366
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,200
Tissue-typed for D and C?

367
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,400
There's got to be some mistake.

368
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,400
Here it is. No name on the slip
and no billing number.

369
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,700
That's not the first time the lab
ran a test on the wrong patient.

370
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,000
Let's go home.
l think you're tired.

371
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,000
l think l'd better check
the tissue-typing lab.

372
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,400
Why?

373
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,400
Nancy's problem was not caused
by wrong lab tests.

374
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,600
l know.

375
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,900
Honey, you're grabbing at straws.

376
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,600
Let's go have some dinner.

377
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,800
-l'm not hungry.
-We'll check the lab later.

378
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Stop acting as if
there's something wrong with me...

379
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,100
...or the way l'm thinking!
l'm checking the lab now.

380
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,100
They're closed.

381
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,000
l won't just stand here!

382
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,600
Susan, the lab is closed.

383
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,800
lt closed at six 6:00.

384
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
ls she all right?

385
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,100
Yeah, she just....

386
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,900
She likes to do things
her own way.

387
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,100
Who's that?

388
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,000
Dr. Wheeler.

389
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,800
We're closed.

390
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
We don't do any determinations
after six, doctor.

391
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,600
l want to look at
your requisition book.

392
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,500
What does it mean when there's
no name and number on the slip?

393
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,200
There's....

394
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,800
There's always
a name or a number, doctor.

395
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
For example, Nancy Greenly.
You did tissue-typing...

396
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,500
...but there's no physician name
and billing number.

397
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,100
Let me see.

398
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,500
Yes, you see, it's been
printed out by computer.

399
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,500
That's hospital policy.

400
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,700
A certain number of these tests
are randomly ordered by computer...

401
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,200
...as a quality check.

402
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
We do the tests here,
they're sent out...

403
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,500
...and done again by an outside lab.

404
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,000
The computer ordered
this test on Greenly?

405
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,000
Yeah, central computer.

406
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,200
Why don't you just show me?

407
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,700
-l can't.
-Why not?

408
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,400
l'm not supposed to.

409
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,100
lt's really important.

410
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,200
Anyway, that information
isn't coded.

411
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,400
lf it isn't coded,
l can't pull it out.

412
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,400
l mean, who would want it?

413
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,900
Well, let's say l wanted a list
of all the patients...

414
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,000
...who had tissue-typing
in the last month.

415
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,500
Same thing. Not coded.

416
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,200
What do you do?
What good is all this equipment?

417
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,900
l thought you recorded information.

418
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,500
We do, but the truth is, we install
these computers to bill patients.

419
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,600
We code patient name and number,
medical or surgical...

420
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,300
...admission diagnosis,
therapy and discharge diagnosis.

421
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,300
Okay, wait a minute.

422
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,800
Can you give me a list
of all surgical patients...

423
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,200
...with discharge diagnoses of coma?

424
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,000
Okay, we have...

425
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,000
...one general category
under ''coma'' ...

426
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,600
...and nine subcategories
under ''brain syndromes.''

427
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,800
Good.

428
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,900
l want a list
of all surgical patients...

429
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,100
...with general category
of coma in the past year.

430
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,400
You're sure you want it?

431
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,000
l had no idea.

432
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,900
lt's a big hospital.

433
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,500
Are you married or what?

434
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,400
Thank you.

435
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,300
Surgical lCU. That's right.

436
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,300
Where'd you get this?

437
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,700
lt's against the law.
lt's illegal to tap a data bank.

438
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,200
l don't see why.
l'm a doctor.

439
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,000
-l've got research--
-That's not the point!

440
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,600
Every officer got the lecture.
No access without authorization.

441
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,600
-They can throw you out.
-Never mind that.

442
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,900
''Never mind''?

443
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,000
Look at this.

444
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,000
Two hundred and forty names.

445
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,500
Ten are young people
admitted for minor procedures.

446
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,400
Breast biopsy, appendectomy.

447
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,600
They all come out in a coma.
Aren't you surprised?

448
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,100
The risk of surgical anesthesia
is six per 1 00,000.

449
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,900
ln a hospital this size, 1 0 patients
in a year is not surprising.

450
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,000
So what are you doing?

451
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,600
You missed your rounds.
You didn't scrub in at the gastrectomy.

452
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,100
l had to do something.

453
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,700
Why don't you do your job?

454
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,300
Mr. Murphy is a 35-year-old
in good health...

455
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,800
...admitted for a meniscectomy.
He's scheduled for this morning.

456
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,200
Promises, promises.
They keep telling me...

457
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,100
...there's a delay, another half-hour.

458
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,600
Well, the suspense
is really killing me.

459
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,800
l thought you doctors
liked to operate.

460
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,500
-We'll get to you.
-l'd hate to be left out.

461
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,100
How did you get your injury?

462
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,800
Playing touch football.

463
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,500
You know, with the guys,
horsing around.

464
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,900
<i>Dr. Wheeler, see Dr. Harris.</i>

465
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,800
<i>See Dr. Harris in his office.</i>

466
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,200
The chief of surgery himself.

467
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,700
Playing touch football, huh?

468
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,900
Yeah. So l come in,
and all that happens--

469
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,200
Thanks very much, Herb.

470
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,200
We'll get together on it later.

471
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,600
Would you come in?

472
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,000
Excuse me.

473
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,800
Sit down, Sue.

474
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,900
<i>It's Senator Brooke's office.</i>

475
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,800
<i>He wonders if you can</i>
<i>change the meeting to four.</i>

476
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Yes, four is fine.
Notify Henry.

477
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,400
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

478
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:35,500
l like to think that Boston Memorial
is the best hospital in the city...

479
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,500
...perhaps in the country.

480
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,900
l'm committed to it...

481
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,400
...to the house staff we have here,
and to you.

482
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,300
l think you know that.

483
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,500
But we have certain constraints
imposed on us.

484
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:53,800
One is the state law concerning
privacy in computer data access.

485
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,900
An unauthorized entry was made
last night.

486
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,800
We put the young man on probation.

487
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,100
But he told us he made
the illegal entry on your behalf.

488
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,200
That's true.

489
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:11,300
All the discharge diagnoses
of coma over a 1 2-month period?

490
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,100
-l wanted it because l had an idea--
-Well, forgive me.

491
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,000
But it isn't a question
of why you wanted it...

492
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,000
...it's how you got it.

493
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,300
l understand you have personal reasons
for being under stress...

494
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,000
...for not acting as carefully
as you might.

495
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:32,600
And l'm sympathetic to the way
you must feel about...

496
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
...the Greely case.

497
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,900
Greenly. Nancy Greenly.

498
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:40,100
Greenly. Yes, Nancy Greenly case.

499
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,600
l certainly don't want to lose
a good surgical resident.

500
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,300
l think we can handle this, Sue.

501
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,400
l'll keep the evidence...

502
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,800
...and we'll forget
it ever happened, all right?

503
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,700
But l'd like you to see someone.

504
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,100
l was thinking of Dick Morelind.

505
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,900
Dr. Harris, l'm fine.
l don't need a shrink.

506
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,600
No, no, l know you don't.

507
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,100
But it's important to have
on record a talk with Dick Morelind.

508
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,100
-l don't see why.
-Actually...

509
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,900
...it's a precondition to
your continuing on here at Memorial.

510
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,200
l understand.

511
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,200
l think it's unfair.
Everybody's on my back.

512
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,300
Mark's whining about
how l can't make a commitment...

513
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,800
...and l'm cold,
and l'm afraid of intimacy.

514
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,900
Then this happens to Nancy...

515
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,900
...and she's my best friend
since boarding school.

516
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,700
Everyone jumps on my back,
acts like l'm neurotic...

517
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,900
...and l'm not doing my job!

518
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,200
There's concern about
breaking the law.

519
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,100
l wanted to do something.
Do you understand?

520
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,000
Do something right away.

521
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,600
l just couldn't sit there
and watch Nancy and....

522
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,200
How do you feel about
what happened?

523
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,800
Confused...

524
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,500
...that's all.

525
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,600
Just confused.

526
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,500
lt's very...

527
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,300
...confusing.

528
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:17,400
l wanted to understand
what happened to her.

529
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,300
Nobody else here seems to care.

530
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,400
Nobody else cares?

531
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,900
Listen.

532
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,800
There have been 1 0 cases
of unexplained coma...

533
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,600
...in young, healthy patients
in the last year.

534
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,900
Now, don't you find that surprising?

535
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,600
You don't.

536
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:41,900
Susan, this hospital does
30,000 operations a year.

537
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:46,600
l'm not surprised a few turn out
with serious unexplained side effects.

538
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,500
Medicine isn't perfect.

539
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,900
We all accept that.

540
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,300
Don't we?

541
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,100
There's a crisis
in her personal life.

542
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,400
-She's involved with a resident.
-l know.

543
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,900
lt's led her to overreact
to this situation...

544
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,400
...which she has not
consciously faced.

545
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,700
She's under stress
and a little paranoid.

546
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,600
Think we'll have
any more trouble with her?

547
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,300
l don't think so.

548
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,900
l hope you're right.

549
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,100
l hate to admit it. l think l was
really upset about Nancy.

550
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,600
You on call tonight?

551
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,000
So am l.

552
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,900
Why don't we have
a terrific dinner...

553
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,500
...just the two of us
in the hospital cafeteria?

554
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,400
-Sounds great!
-About 1 1 ?

555
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,700
You got a date.

556
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:32,700
Maybe afterwards, we can go to
our favorite room on the eighth floor.

557
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,800
Nobody will be there after midnight.

558
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,700
l think we're looking
at cortical anoxia.

559
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,000
-l'll check the Babinski.
-How old is he?

560
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,300
Thirty-five.

561
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,800
When did you administer
the additional dosage?

562
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,500
At the onset of cardiac irritability.
The surgeon said he was light.

563
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,700
Surgeons know nothing about anesthesia.
What'd you give?

564
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Two cc's push.

565
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,400
There was no reason
there'd be a problem.

566
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,600
Just seemed a little light.

567
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,000
Some PVC in runs,
transient hypotension...

568
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,100
...but no sign of hypoxia.

569
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,400
Skin color and blood
were all red and fully oxygenated.

570
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,300
The pupils are fixed and dilated,
l must presume brain death.

571
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,300
Any relation to your other case?

572
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,500
Completely different.

573
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,600
Different staffs,
different anesthetic agents.

574
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,000
-He better be trached.
-Do we need a pulmonary consult?

575
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,200
Request the consult...

576
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,400
...but go ahead with the tracheotomy.

577
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,800
This is a long-term
management problem.

578
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,900
-Come on.
-lt happened again.

579
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:29,700
That's Dr. George, chief of anesthesia.
He's got it under control.

580
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,800
ls there a research protocol
this case would fit?

581
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,900
He's a good research case.
Excellent teaching material.

582
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,800
lt's true, Mr. Murphy
presents challenges...

583
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,500
...electrolyte balance lV,
caloric maintenance...

584
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:44,100
...possible pseudomonas infection.

585
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,800
There may be additional
risk of staph osteomyelitis.

586
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,700
But l think you'll be
agreeably surprised, Dr. George.

587
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,900
We can keep him alive...

588
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,400
...in stable vital signs, a year...

589
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,200
...two years, indefinitely.

590
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,400
You can't just look the other way.

591
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,400
Nobody's looking the other way.

592
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,800
Mark, twice in two days.
lt's not normal.

593
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,800
-ln certain cases, patients always--
-You told me that.

594
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,900
Two in two days.

595
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,000
You're just sensitized to it.

596
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,700
lt just happened to a friend
and now you're looking for it.

597
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,400
Twice in two days
is just our lousy luck.

598
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,900
-Did Harris take the readout?
-Yes.

599
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,700
All right, then forget it.

600
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,200
The hospital has
review boards and committees.

601
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,800
They'll look into it.

602
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,400
Now, you got a job to do,
so forget about this.

603
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,600
You're right. You're right.

604
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,400
l'll see you at dinner?

605
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,000
This is Dr. Wheeler.

606
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:16,600
l know about the conference
but l'm tied up with a patient now.

607
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,300
Well, l'm afraid l can't
make it there in time.

608
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,000
Where am l?

609
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,700
l'm in the emergency ward.

610
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,900
Yes, it is important.

611
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,400
Will you hold on?

612
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,100
Well, that's funny,
but all these charts you wanted...

613
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:37,100
...they're all signed out to Dr. George,
the chief of anesthesiology.

614
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,300
Good afternoon, Dr. George.

615
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,500
Good afternoon, staff.

616
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,900
We have a happy lab here.

617
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,700
lt's precise.
There's nothing left to chance.

618
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,800
There are no mistakes.

619
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,000
The charts are right here.
There's no mystery.

620
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,200
They're right here.
What is it you wanted?

621
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,100
l'd like to look at them.

622
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,000
For what reason?

623
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,600
l'm interested in unexplained coma
following routine surgery.

624
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,300
You're interested?

625
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,900
l'm more than interested.

626
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,500
My anesthesiology staff
is more than interested.

627
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,300
We're deeply concerned.

628
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
l understand.

629
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,900
l'm not sure you do.

630
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,100
Perhaps something was missed?

631
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,700
Missed?

632
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,900
Every professor of anesthesia,
most of our staff...

633
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,900
...more than 40 experts
have gone over these charts.

634
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,300
You think something was missed?

635
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,600
But if anything
links them together--

636
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,700
lf anything linked them,
we'd know it.

637
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,600
Here they are, 1 0 cases.
There are now 1 2.

638
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,700
Different ages and sexes.
Different surgeons and anesthetists.

639
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,900
Different methods of induction.

640
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:47,900
They share nothing in common except
they all emerged with unexplained coma.

641
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,600
We're certainly not neglecting
that problem.

642
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,100
l didn't say you were.

643
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,200
Do you mind if l have a look?

644
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,900
l'm afraid l do mind.

645
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,000
Thank you for your interest,
however misplaced.

646
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,300
Good afternoon.

647
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,000
Oh, my God, you did--
How could you do that?

648
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,000
Dr. George is a past president...

649
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,700
...of the American Society
of Anesthesiologists.

650
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:39,300
He's a member of the AAAS.
He's on the board of the NlH...

651
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,200
...and you tell him
he's doing his job wrong.

652
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,000
-l just wanted to see the charts.
-That's not your area.

653
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,200
That's not your responsibility.
You're way off base.

654
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,800
You know who his wife is?

655
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,400
-l don't care.
-Well, you should.

656
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,700
His wife is Amy Cabot.
She's related to Godfrey Lowell.

657
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,500
l don't care about Boston society.

658
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,100
Dr. George's wife...

659
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:05,400
...is worth somewhere between
50 and 1 00 million dollars.

660
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,700
When she dies,
that money will go somewhere.

661
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,100
So what?

662
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,900
So he has a lot of muscle here.
He's the wrong man to cross.

663
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,400
You afraid to be seen with me?

664
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,600
Come in.

665
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,300
-Hi, Bill.
-How are you?

666
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,300
Good.

667
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,900
Sit down.

668
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,800
You know, Mark...

669
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,200
...l always thought that you'd have
this job when l leave next year.

670
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,600
Everybody thinks so.

671
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,900
You're the logical choice.
You're a good surgeon.

672
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,500
You're well-organized.
You run a good service.

673
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,700
Well, thank you very much, Bill.

674
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,900
l'd hate to see anything
stand in your way.

675
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,700
You know what l mean.

676
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,900
She has the chiefs of service
in an uproar.

677
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:55,400
-She's under a lot of pressure.
-And so are we.

678
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,900
They're talking about releasing her
from her position here at the Mem.

679
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,400
But nobody really wants
that kind of...

680
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,400
...adverse publicity, that commotion.

681
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,000
Of course not.

682
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,500
You have influence with her?

683
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,900
l don't know. She's paranoid.

684
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,800
She thinks there's a conspiracy.

685
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,800
George keeping the charts
from her did not help.

686
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,500
Does she think you're involved?

687
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,400
No, l don't think so.

688
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:31,600
Let's hope not, Mark. What happens
to Susan may depend on you.

689
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,800
l understand that, Bill.

690
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,700
You know, a good chief resident...

691
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:40,300
...handles problems
like this every day.

692
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
l think if you're able to exert
some influence over her...

693
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,000
...people would be appreciative.

694
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,300
Well, l'll try.

695
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,900
Good man.

696
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,700
Where's Greenly?

697
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:16,000
That coma case? She was to be
transferred to the Jefferson lnstitute.

698
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,400
l guess she went there.

699
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,800
Liz, did Greenly go to Jefferson?

700
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,400
No, she arrested at six
this morning.

701
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,700
-She's down in pathology.
-ln pathology?

702
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,600
Yeah, they're probably doing
the autopsy now.

703
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,800
Do you have a patient
named Greenly?

704
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,600
l don't know. Check in there.
l can't keep track of names.

705
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,300
ln microscopic section,
we may expect evidence...

706
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,700
...of fatty degeneration in cells...

707
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,500
...with polymorphs and histiocytes
around them.

708
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,700
Okay, incise the kidney there.

709
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,400
Looks normal.

710
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,700
Okay, remove it.

711
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,200
Greenly?

712
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,800
This is Howard.
Greenly's over there.

713
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,900
Hi, Jim.

714
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:22,200
Hi, Sue. What brings you here?
lnterested in this case?

715
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,500
That's right.

716
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,500
Hell of a puzzler.
Young girl, good health...

717
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:30,100
...in for a therapeutic AB,
comes out comatose.

718
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,400
Found anything?

719
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,800
Naturally, we started with the brain.

720
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,600
Grossly, it was normal.
l'm doing a section. Want to see?

721
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,500
Ordinarily, these coma cases
get shipped to Jefferson.

722
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,800
-What's Jefferson?
-Jefferson lnstitute.

723
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,500
A chronic-care facility.
Government thing.

724
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,600
They take care of the vegetables.

725
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,200
Sometimes they die before
they get there, like this one.

726
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,400
More work for us.

727
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,800
Now we'll get an idea.

728
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:03,700
We're looking for anything.
Micro-infarcts, staph loci...

729
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,300
...gross hemorrhagic areas,
congenital defects....

730
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,200
Nothing. Just like the
other cases, we come up cold.

731
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,800
l know it sounds silly...

732
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:18,300
...but if you wanted to put people
in a coma, what would you do?

733
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,600
On purpose?

734
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,500
Diethyl para-amino tannadol.

735
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,400
No, it leaves a serum trace.

736
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,100
-lf you look for it.
-lt also peaks alk phos.

737
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,600
A real giveaway.
Besides, who can get tannadol?

738
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,000
-Use paradine.
-lt has a taste.

739
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:35,200
We'd make great murderers.
Who knows more than a pathologist?

740
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,200
lt keeps my wife in line.

741
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,400
Hell of a lot of crimes
slip through our fingers.

742
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,400
But in this case, a coma.

743
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:46,000
First rule of crime:

744
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,500
Keep it simple.

745
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,600
What's simple?

746
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,000
Carbon monoxide.

747
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,400
Boring.

748
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,300
Carbon monoxide?

749
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,400
Sure, it's perfect.

750
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,800
Anesthetist uses carbon monoxide
instead of oxygen.

751
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,200
lt's colorless and makes the blood red
so the surgeon doesn't notice.

752
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:10,100
But the brain dies from lack of oxygen.
The patient doesn't wake up.

753
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,200
No other effects?

754
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,700
Sure. Cardiac irritability.

755
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Which this case had.

756
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:18,500
lt'd be better to block
the neuro-muscular junction...

757
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,600
...with succinylcholine.

758
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,200
-Who's gonna do it?
-Who'll feed your carbon monoxide?

759
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,700
That's the problem.

760
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:28,400
Been 1 2 coma cases
here in the last year.

761
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,000
They're always different.

762
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,800
Different case, different anesthetist,
different operation.

763
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,100
Hard to imagine it's murder.

764
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,100
Are you sure?

765
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:43,400
What do you think? There's a conspiracy
at the Boston Memorial Hospital...

766
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,300
...involving all the anesthetists?

767
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:51,200
<i>I've had a rather hysterical call</i>
<i>from Dr. George in anesthesiology.</i>

768
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:55,800
Dr. George is a powerful person here,
not only because of his position.

769
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,900
-There are other reasons.
-l gather.

770
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,400
What does that mean?

771
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:06,000
Just because he has a rich wife,
he's able to throw his weight around.

772
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,000
You're looking for truth and justice.

773
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,700
l'm looking for fairness.

774
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:14,600
ln fairness, you've challenged
the professional competence...

775
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,900
...of a chief of service
at this hospital.

776
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:20,000
And he didn't take it well.
No reason he should.

777
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,900
-Now he's out for blood.
-l've noticed.

778
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:26,300
Sue, believe me, l'm on your side...

779
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,500
...for all kinds of reasons.

780
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,900
l don't want to let
another chief of service...

781
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,500
...get one of
my house officers fired.

782
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,000
Dr. Harris, l just wanted
to look at his charts.

783
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,000
Sue, right now, l can protect you...

784
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,800
...because you're good.
And frankly, because you're a woman.

785
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,400
l don't want concessions.

786
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:49,700
At the moment, you'd better
take any you can get.

787
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,600
You know what happened to Greenly?

788
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,100
Yes.

789
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,600
What happened?

790
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:09,700
She died.

791
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,000
How do you feel about that?

792
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,500
How do l feel?

793
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,900
l feel....

794
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,100
She was my best friend.

795
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,500
She understood me.

796
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,000
She understood me.

797
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,300
lt's not fair.

798
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,600
None of this is fair.

799
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:49,800
Here.

800
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:54,100
Nobody understands.

801
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,500
-No one.
-l know, l know.

802
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:07,100
<i>Dr. Harris, the secretary of HEW</i>
<i>is on the phone from Washington.</i>

803
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,300
Call back.

804
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:20,700
Too many of us shut ourselves off
from our feelings.

805
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,900
We don't explore them.

806
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,400
We don't understand them.

807
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,200
We don't understand ourselves.

808
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
lt's the toughest thing
about our profession.

809
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:35,300
-Dr. Harris--
-l'll take care of the politics.

810
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,800
You just look out for yourself.

811
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,200
Take the weekend off, Sue.

812
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,800
Go walk on the beach.
Get away from the hospital.

813
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,500
l'm so embarrassed by this.

814
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,000
Don't be. Don't be.

815
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,600
Our emotions are what make us human.

816
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:58,200
Come on.

817
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,400
Come and see me next week.

818
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:03,200
-Right.
-Good.

819
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:08,000
-Have a good weekend.
-Thank you, sir.

820
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:20,800
Women!

821
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,200
Christ!

822
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:54,900
God!

823
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
<i>Just say you don't believe me.</i>

824
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:02,700
A man fixed your car
so it wouldn't start...

825
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:05,100
...then followed you
into the MTA station.

826
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,400
Well, it's true.

827
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,200
Your car is always breaking down.

828
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,500
l just think you're tired.

829
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:21,500
-l'm not tired.
-Why don't we go away for the weekend?

830
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:26,200
Go up the coast, have some fun
and just forget the hospital.

831
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:31,300
There are 1 2 coma cases.

832
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:35,400
Nobody thinks they're linked,
but l've seen charts for two of them:

833
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:38,700
Nancy, and now this new guy, Murphy.

834
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,100
And?

835
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,600
And both occurred in O.R. 8.

836
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:44,800
O.R. 8?

837
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:53,400
What if carbon monoxide
were being pumped into O.R. 8?

838
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,400
What if that were true?

839
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,000
-Get your coat on.
-Why?

840
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,900
We're going to take a look.

841
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,600
Right now.

842
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:09,900
O.R. 8.

843
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,000
Well?

844
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,000
Looks okay.

845
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,100
-How many operations you done in here?
-A lot.

846
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,600
You ever had any problems?

847
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:38,800
Well, l already checked.

848
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:44,900
The day Nancy had her problem,
there were five other operations.

849
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,800
Four before and one after.

850
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:52,900
The day Sean Murphy had his,
there were six others.

851
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:54,900
Two before...

852
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:56,600
...and four after.

853
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:59,800
They were all normal.

854
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,900
Let's get out of here.

855
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,700
This is what you call
really working for it.

856
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:42,700
No fair.

857
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,200
Fair.

858
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:21,000
l thought we were
taking the weekend off?

859
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,300
Come on. Just a quick look.

860
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:26,200
Please?

861
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:28,500
For me?

862
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,600
l don't know.

863
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,600
There doesn't seem
to be anybody around.

864
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,800
-You want to go in?
-Not really, no.

865
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:29,300
l do.

866
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Can l help you?

867
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,000
l'm Dr. Wheeler.

868
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,600
-You're early, aren't you, doctor?
-Early?

869
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:51,000
You're supposed to come on Tuesday,
day after tomorrow...

870
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,600
...when the tour is scheduled.

871
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:54,400
The tour?

872
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,200
Yes, it's every Tuesday at 1 1 .

873
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,200
The regular tour for physicians.

874
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:03,000
Could l see it now?

875
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:05,900
l'm afraid that's impossible.

876
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,800
l just thought
as long as l'm here....

877
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,200
We're simply not set up for it.

878
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,300
May l speak with
the physician in charge?

879
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,500
There is no physician in charge.

880
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:20,700
Well, then, your supervisor.

881
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:23,000
l have no supervisor.

882
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:26,800
-Who runs the staff?
-There is no staff.

883
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,300
You're here alone?

884
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:33,400
Of course not. There are
technicians, security people....

885
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:38,600
l'm sure when you've taken the tour
Tuesday, it will all be clear to you.

886
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,200
What did you say your name was?

887
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:44,000
Dr. Wheeler. Susan Wheeler.

888
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:48,500
We look forward to seeing you
at 1 1 on Tuesday. Goodbye.

889
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:38,800
l heard what you said
to Dr. George...

890
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,500
...in the lab.

891
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:44,100
l heard what you said to him.

892
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:45,800
You're right.

893
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:48,100
Right about what?

894
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:51,600
l've seen how they do it.

895
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,700
l know how it works.

896
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,000
How what works?

897
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:04,700
Do you want to scrub in
on an aortic valve replacement?

898
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:07,100
Harvey's doing one in room 1 6
in 1 0 minutes.

899
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:08,300
-Sure.
-Great!

900
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:11,800
Tom was going to scrub in,
but his case is running late.

901
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,600
l checked them out.

902
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:20,400
You come down to maintenance tonight.
l'll show it to you.

903
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,400
Good morning, sir.

904
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,400
-Did you have a good weekend?
-l did. Thank you.

905
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:02,400
Good evening.

906
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:04,600
Good evening.

907
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:13,600
You just gonna stare at me?

908
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,600
What'd you do that for?

909
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:25,000
They said make it look
like an accident.

910
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:46,500
-What's happening?
-The generator will kick in.

911
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:51,300
lKelly?

912
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:55,200
lKelly?

913
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,700
What do you got now?

914
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:25,300
Nothing.

915
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:28,200
Try the connector cable.

916
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:31,600
l think that does it for me.
You got anything else?

917
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,700
No, l don't need anything else.

918
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:37,200
-lf we need you again--
-You can reach me at the hospital.

919
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:41,300
Must be a short in the junction box...

920
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,400
...or the step-down panel.

921
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,900
lt should read 1 4
point something.

922
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,000
1 4.3.

923
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:52,100
Okay, now we should have 1 1 .9.

924
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:54,100
Eleven-nine.

925
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:56,400
And now there's--

926
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,600
Fourteen-three.

927
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,300
Good. Nothing's shorted so far.

928
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:03,400
We got lucky.

929
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,000
Poor lKelly.

930
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:07,000
Poor lKelly?

931
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:09,800
He got sloppy.

932
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,400
You know what it is?
That drinking at lunch.

933
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:15,200
l said, ''Stop drinking.
You'll get into trouble.''

934
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:53,900
<i>Two and two's the count.</i>
<i>He can't get more.</i>

935
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:00,700
-What did you leave in here?
-Just some charts.

936
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,400
l'll call Dr. George
and tell him l let you in.

937
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:06,100
lt's all right.
l have to call him anyway.

938
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,000
Well, okay.

939
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:11,000
-Boston ahead by one.
-That's great.

940
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,700
l've got $ 20 on this game.

941
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,800
What is it?

942
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,300
Hospital security, doctor.

943
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:15,400
-What's the score?
-Just a routine check, doctor.

944
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,600
Easy, kids.

945
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:51,600
Jerry?

946
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:55,300
-What's going on?
-Jerry, l'm so happy to see you.

947
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:58,600
That's the nicest thing
anybody's said to me all day.

948
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:00,900
ls something wrong?

949
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:04,100
You see, there's this guy.

950
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:06,500
He said he was hospital security.

951
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,400
l happen to know that he--

952
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:14,300
<i>It's a high fly ball and...</i>

953
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:16,600
<i>...he's out!</i>

954
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:17,700
You were saying?

955
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:20,800
l guess l have
an overactive imagination.

956
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:22,000
Be like me.

957
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:24,600
Everybody says l have
no imagination at all.

958
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,600
l'm going over to
the medical school library.

959
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,600
l'll go with you.

960
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:40,400
The tubular filtration gradient may be
more than 500 milliequivalents.

961
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:44,200
That means there's an active
transport with phosphorylated ATP.

962
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:49,500
But if you trace radioisotopes,
densities don't look right.

963
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,700
lt's a breakthrough
in understanding the kidney.

964
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:56,400
Remember that yellow cadaver
skin under your fingernails?

965
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:58,300
Nobody could eat lunch.

966
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:00,500
lt seems like a long time ago.

967
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:03,300
Back in the days
when we couldn't eat lunch.

968
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:07,700
Wouldn't you know?

969
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:12,900
Dr. Marcus.

970
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:17,300
Well, if he's complaining of pain.

971
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:20,300
Try another five cc's l.M.

972
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:25,700
l see.
Well, then MS 1 0 milligrams.

973
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:30,700
Yes, morphine sulphate.
He's not in respiratory difficulty.

974
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,400
You can put him on
respiratory arrest with morphine.

975
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:38,100
Particularly if he's on wall O-2.

976
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,800
You'll have to check
and see what he's on.

977
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:49,100
Air is fine, but oxygen....

978
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:54,300
lf he's on wall oxygen,
tell me how many liters of flow.

979
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:58,000
Six liters!
You can't put him on MS.

980
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:00,600
You'll have to stay with Talwin.

981
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:06,200
Give him five cc's of water.
Say it's morphine.

982
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,800
He won't know.
He's a pain in the ass anyway.

983
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:44,000
Mark, it's so awful!
lt's so terrible.

984
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,400
Take it easy.
Honey, slow down.

985
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:49,400
He was trying to kill me.
And l had to keep going.

986
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:53,000
And all the bodies.
lt's horrible!

987
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:54,500
Take it easy.
Slow down.

988
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:57,900
Mark, it's all happening.
lt's really happening.

989
01:16:58,100 --> 01:17:02,400
Somebody's putting people into comas.
They're murdering them.

990
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:04,900
No, no, really.

991
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:09,300
lKelly's dead. l was down there.
l found the gas line.

992
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:13,900
lt starts in the basement
and it goes up the main tunnel...

993
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:18,400
...then plugs into the oxygen line
in the ceiling that goes to O.R. 8.

994
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,500
-Honey, slow down.
-They're killing people...

995
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:22,900
...with carbon monoxide in O.R. 8.

996
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:27,400
-They have a radio to turn the valve.
-l believe you.

997
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,400
All the cases happened in O.R. 8.

998
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:33,100
And they all went
to the Jefferson lnstitute.

999
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:39,400
And this guy, he chased me all over.
And there were so many bodies.

1000
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:42,000
lt's all right. lt's okay.

1001
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:45,200
And this is real.
Call the police.

1002
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:49,700
We have to do something!
This is real, Mark.

1003
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:51,500
l can prove it.

1004
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:53,600
Sure, you can. You can.

1005
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:55,700
-Just lie down.
-This is real.

1006
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:58,300
l know you can.
Now one thing at a time.

1007
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
l want to give you a Valium and--

1008
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,800
How about a cup of tea
to settle you down?

1009
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,800
A cup of hot tea?

1010
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:11,800
Then we're going to talk
after you settle down.

1011
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,200
So you just rest right here.

1012
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:19,700
You just stay right here
on the bed?

1013
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:22,600
That-a-girl.
That's it. You just relax.

1014
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:23,600
l can't--

1015
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:27,700
That's it. Just relax.
Close your eyes.

1016
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:31,900
That's it. Okay, that-a-girl.

1017
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:36,300
-Now, l'll get you a cup of tea.
-You're so great, Mark.

1018
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:39,100
Stay here, honey.
Just stay right here.

1019
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:50,900
That's a hell of a story, Susan.

1020
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:55,000
You really had
a lot of people worried.

1021
01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:00,300
Don't worry.
Everything's going to be okay now.

1022
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:15,900
She came back.

1023
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:19,600
No, she's here now.

1024
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:23,800
Of course.
No, l can manage that.

1025
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:26,500
l'll keep her here.

1026
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,200
Look, l'd better go.

1027
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:35,100
You want some honey with your tea?

1028
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:45,500
<i>Memorial Hospital</i>
<i>residents' exchange.</i>

1029
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:48,300
<i>This is Dr. Wheeler.</i>
<i>Are there any messages for me?</i>

1030
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:52,100
<i>Yes, doctor. Quite a few.</i>
<i>Just a minute, please.</i>

1031
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,400
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I'll have to call you back.</i>

1032
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:00,900
<i>What number can you be reached at?</i>

1033
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:08,200
<i>Dr. Wheeler, are you there?</i>
<i>What number can we reach you at?</i>

1034
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:13,600
<i>We are dealing in</i>
<i>an area of uncertainty.</i>

1035
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,400
<i>An area where there are no rules,</i>
<i>contradictory laws...</i>

1036
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:21,400
<i>...and no clear social consensus</i>
<i>as to what should be done.</i>

1037
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:25,800
<i>And the cost of care for the chronic</i>
<i>patient has become prohibitive.</i>

1038
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,200
<i>This is particularly the case</i>
<i>with the long-term comatose patient.</i>

1039
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:34,800
The Jefferson lnstitute is a government-
sponsored experimental facility...

1040
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:39,200
...designed to provide quality
life support to the comatose patient.

1041
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:41,300
l wish to emphasize...

1042
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:45,100
...no moral or ethical position
is being taken here.

1043
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:49,400
We do not participate in the debate
over whether these patients...

1044
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:50,800
...are alive or dead...

1045
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:54,700
...or whether their care should
be continued or terminated.

1046
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:59,100
Society will decide if there will
be more of these facilities or not.

1047
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:04,600
ln the meantime, we merely provide
care as inexpensively as possible.

1048
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:07,200
Now, if you will
please come this way....

1049
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:09,800
This is our visiting room...

1050
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:13,200
...where relatives can see patients
who are stored here.

1051
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:15,400
You see, it all looks quite normal.

1052
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:17,900
We've found it is inadvisable...

1053
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:22,300
...for relatives to know the actual
circumstances of patient care.

1054
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:25,600
lt's too much of a shock.
So we bring the patient here.

1055
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:29,300
After the visit, we return them
to the main care facility.

1056
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:32,900
lf you will put on your glasses,
we'll go there now.

1057
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:36,300
This is our main care facility.

1058
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:39,400
Temperature here is
94.7 degrees Fahrenheit...

1059
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,800
...humidity 82 percent.

1060
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,100
This stability reduces
patient heat loss...

1061
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:47,300
...and caloric requirements.

1062
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:51,700
There's a low-level ultraviolet
bacteriostatic flux...

1063
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:53,600
...and to prevent bedsores...

1064
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:56,900
...patients are suspended
by wires through long bones.

1065
01:22:57,200 --> 01:23:00,900
-How do you get to them up there?
-There's no need for contact.

1066
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:05,000
Every one of our patients is
individually monitored by the computer.

1067
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:09,400
lndwelling telemetry records weight,
fluid balance...

1068
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:13,300
...blood pressure, blood gases,
temperature, metabolic balance.

1069
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:18,300
Our computer makes an immediate
adjustment for any change in condition.

1070
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:19,700
For example...

1071
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:25,300
...we simulate hypotension by direct
compression of the telemetry unit.

1072
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:29,400
The computer will sense this
and make an immediate adjustment.

1073
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:37,100
Well, almost immediate.

1074
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:41,500
Sometimes there's a--

1075
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,700
There we are.

1076
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:47,100
Sometimes there is a short delay,
but as you can see...

1077
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:50,200
...the computer put the patient
in the Trendelenburg position...

1078
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,700
...and administered a vasoconstrictor.

1079
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:57,200
We have very few crises here.
With the assistance of technology...

1080
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:00,000
...these patients
are maintained beautifully.

1081
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:03,400
Without it,
they would have died long ago.

1082
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:07,700
But the law says they must be
maintained, and this is one solution.

1083
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:10,200
How large is your staff?

1084
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:12,300
One nurse, a physician on call...

1085
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:16,100
...two computer technicians and
a small security staff. That's all.

1086
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:17,700
And the rest of the building?

1087
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:21,400
lt's of no interest. Just mechanical
and technical facilities.

1088
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:22,600
What's the cost?

1089
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:26,000
For each patient, about $ 60 a day.

1090
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:30,900
But we can store 1 ,000 patients
and then the cost will go down.

1091
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:35,200
We expect to maintain patients
for about $5 a day.

1092
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:38,800
Less than it costs to hire
a baby-sitter for a few hours.

1093
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:41,100
lf there are
no further questions...

1094
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:44,600
...this concludes our tour
of the Jefferson lnstitute.

1095
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:48,400
Before you go, we have some literature
we'd like you to take.

1096
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:52,600
lt explains some of the background
and details of our work here.

1097
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,800
We hope the tour has been informative.

1098
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,900
And if you have any questions
about the Jefferson lnstitute...

1099
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:00,700
...don't hesitate to call.

1100
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:02,400
lt shouldn't be about money.

1101
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:05,600
Maybe your patients don't
complain about their bills.

1102
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:07,400
Thank you for your interest.

1103
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:08,700
Goodbye.

1104
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:18,100
Do you know what l wanted?

1105
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:20,500
l wanted corned beef on rye...

1106
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:24,200
...or else a roast beef with Russian.
And what do you bring me?

1107
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:25,900
Ham and cheese.

1108
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:27,900
Well, that's all they had.

1109
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:31,600
You mean to tell me
they didn't have any corned beef?

1110
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,600
That's what the man said.

1111
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:37,200
No corned beef. The guy must
have been putting you on.

1112
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:44,400
George says we're having an electrical
inspection tomorrow morning.

1113
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:46,200
Are we set for that?

1114
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:47,600
Norman!

1115
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:49,300
Yes, we should be.

1116
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:52,600
-Do you want the bidding program now?
-ln a moment.

1117
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:57,800
Did you see the game last night?
Two out, Bumbry's up.

1118
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,900
He hits a ball to left field.

1119
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:03,300
White misses it
and goes for a triple.

1120
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,900
Lungs, 1 1 00 grams.

1121
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:09,100
lKidneys, 780, 620.

1122
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:12,200
Eighty and six-twenty.

1123
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,700
What about the heart?

1124
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:18,300
-l wrote it down someplace.
-What's the temperature?

1125
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:20,800
Right now, 1 2 degrees centigrade...

1126
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,600
...and all the rest at 1 4.

1127
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:47,700
Where's that heart going?

1128
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:50,700
San Francisco.

1129
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:53,200
l think they're getting
$ 75,000 for it.

1130
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:56,500
-ls that all?
-lt was a bad match on tissue-typing.

1131
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:59,300
Only two out of four.
But it's a rush order.

1132
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:02,500
The kidney's a four-tissue match
and in perfect condition.

1133
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:04,800
They'll get 200 grand for that.

1134
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,400
lt's going to Texas.
A millionaire's son.

1135
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:09,700
Good old George has the connections.

1136
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:13,100
So far, George is doing fine.
What about the other kidney?

1137
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:16,200
They're putting it up for bids.
They'll get 1 00 for it.

1138
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:19,400
We have a left kidney,
two hours old, ready to ship.

1139
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:22,500
lt's a 4-3-6-7.
A 31 -year-old male.

1140
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:25,400
The bidding now stands
at forty-two five.

1141
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:27,700
Thank you.

1142
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:29,000
Forty-five.

1143
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:30,500
lt's at 45.

1144
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:32,700
Well, it could be in Zurich in....

1145
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,600
The fastest routing is New York-Rome.
lt'll arrive local time...

1146
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:40,400
... 1 300 hours, which means
elapsed time is 23 hours.

1147
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:45,200
Twenty-three hours elapsed time,
which would make it 1 p.m. your time.

1148
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:47,500
That's the best we can do.

1149
01:28:47,700 --> 01:28:48,900
Thank you.

1150
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:57,800
What's that?

1151
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:01,000
Look at monitor four.

1152
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:05,300
All units!

1153
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:06,600
<i>All units!</i>

1154
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:10,000
<i>There is an unauthorized woman</i>
<i>in the building.</i>

1155
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:12,000
Let's take her alive.

1156
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,700
<i>Visiting room, clear.</i>

1157
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:21,100
<i>Second floor lobby, clear.</i>

1158
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:24,400
<i>Has anyone checked</i>
<i>the main care facility?</i>

1159
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:27,200
<i>We have no report from that sector.</i>

1160
01:29:40,700 --> 01:29:43,500
Now on the second floor corridor.

1161
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
Don't you have a key to this place?

1162
01:30:29,900 --> 01:30:33,300
<i>Repeat: No intruders</i>
<i>on sub-basement one.</i>

1163
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:37,000
Unit one, she's out on the ledge.
lt's too far for her to jump.

1164
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:43,200
l don't see her.

1165
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:46,700
She's out there.
She won't get far. We got her now.

1166
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:50,700
Have the dogs start on the north side
and circle the building.

1167
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:53,900
l want security at all exits.
Notify them by radio.

1168
01:30:54,100 --> 01:30:58,400
Search the labs and the roof.
l've had enough of this inefficiency.

1169
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:01,900
<i>Perimeter dog team, come in.</i>
<i>Repeat. Come in!</i>

1170
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:50,700
<i>Main control, any readings</i>
<i>from outside? Where are the dogs?</i>

1171
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:15,700
<i>I don't know where the hell she is.</i>

1172
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:18,300
<i>She's got to be around here somewhere.</i>

1173
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:32,600
There, there.

1174
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:36,100
lt's going to be all right.

1175
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:40,200
lt's going to be all right.

1176
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:07,900
<i>First floor lobby, check in.</i>

1177
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:10,700
<i>First floor lobby, please respond.</i>

1178
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:12,900
No, she's not here.

1179
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:15,300
Of course l've been notified.

1180
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:18,100
l'm keeping an eye out for her.

1181
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:22,700
lf she comes here, we'll get her.
There's no way she can escape.

1182
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Let's get this loaded quick.

1183
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:49,300
l got to make it in time
for the Dallas flight.

1184
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:51,600
And we got rush-hour traffic.

1185
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:54,700
Even with the siren,
l gotta get through the tunnel.

1186
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:58,100
Life gets tougher all the time.

1187
01:33:59,100 --> 01:34:00,500
l see you got the dogs out.

1188
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:04,100
-We got a little security problem.
-We all got problems.

1189
01:34:04,300 --> 01:34:06,300
World's full of problems.

1190
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:11,900
Take it away!

1191
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:12,000
Do me a favor.

1192
01:35:12,900 --> 01:35:15,000
Don't say anything to upset her.

1193
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:16,600
l wouldn't say anything.

1194
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:19,200
She's an old woman. She's sick.

1195
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:21,600
-She may die.
-Did the doctor say that?

1196
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:25,100
-l don't know.
-You don't know what the doctor said?

1197
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:29,200
-l'll believe what the doctor says.
-Just don't upset her.

1198
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:31,400
This could be it.

1199
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:33,000
This could be the end.

1200
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:39,100
lt's incredible.

1201
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:44,300
Well, l could use a drink.
How about you? Scotch?

1202
01:35:45,700 --> 01:35:47,100
Whatever you're having.

1203
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:49,900
l like a woman who drinks Scotch.

1204
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:55,100
You've done a remarkable thing.

1205
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,600
Your dedication...

1206
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:59,800
...your concern...

1207
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:02,900
...your pursuit of this problem.

1208
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:06,200
lt's all extremely impressive.

1209
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:08,700
And l'm very grateful.

1210
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:11,600
-Thank you.
-Cheers.

1211
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:18,800
ln fact, l'm more than grateful.

1212
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:21,400
l'm deeply in your debt.

1213
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:25,500
The question is,
how do we handle this?

1214
01:36:25,900 --> 01:36:27,800
You arrest Dr. George.

1215
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:34,700
<i>Sorry, Dr. Harris.</i>
<i>It's Landis in Washington.</i>

1216
01:36:35,100 --> 01:36:36,200
Put him on.

1217
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:38,000
Excuse me.

1218
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,400
Hello, Tom. How are you?

1219
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:45,700
Fine, fine, just fine.

1220
01:36:46,900 --> 01:36:49,000
Sure, l'd be delighted to testify.

1221
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:51,800
You know how strongly l feel
about the matter.

1222
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,200
But have you consulted
the president?

1223
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,000
l see.

1224
01:36:58,200 --> 01:36:59,400
This won't take long.

1225
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:16,500
Good, good.

1226
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,600
Good. Thanks for calling.

1227
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:35,200
You've put me in a difficult position.

1228
01:37:36,700 --> 01:37:38,400
lt seems you know everything.

1229
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,200
You're George.

1230
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:48,100
l wonder if you can understand...

1231
01:37:49,100 --> 01:37:52,300
...if you can take the long view...

1232
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:57,200
...the view of a person in my position.

1233
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:03,100
You did it?

1234
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:06,100
No decision is easy.

1235
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:09,200
lt only looks that way
when you're young.

1236
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:11,900
When you're older...

1237
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:15,100
...everything is complicated.

1238
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:18,100
There is no black and white.

1239
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:20,000
Only gray.

1240
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:24,700
But our society faces
momentous decisions.

1241
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:28,400
Decisions about the right to die...

1242
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:31,600
...about abortion,
about terminal illness...

1243
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:34,700
...prolonged coma, transplantation.

1244
01:38:34,900 --> 01:38:37,800
Decisions about life and death.

1245
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,200
But society isn't deciding.

1246
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:43,300
Congress isn't deciding.
The courts aren't deciding.

1247
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:45,700
Religion isn't deciding. Why?

1248
01:38:46,100 --> 01:38:50,000
Because society is leaving it
up to us, the experts.

1249
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:51,400
The doctors.

1250
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:54,600
You're crazy.

1251
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:58,700
Americans spend $ 1 25 billion
a year on health.

1252
01:38:58,900 --> 01:39:00,200
More than defense.

1253
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:03,600
Because Americans believe
in medical care.

1254
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:08,500
These great hospital complexes
are the cathedrals of our age.

1255
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:12,200
Billions of dollars,
thousands of beds...

1256
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:17,000
...a whole nation of sick people
turning to us for help.

1257
01:39:23,900 --> 01:39:25,900
You ought to see somebody.

1258
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:28,300
They're children, Sue.

1259
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:30,300
They trust us.

1260
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:33,800
We can't tell them everything.

1261
01:39:34,700 --> 01:39:39,300
Our job is to make things easier
for them. l'm sure you agree.

1262
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:42,100
You're killing people.

1263
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:46,100
We must always take the long view...

1264
01:39:46,700 --> 01:39:50,800
...not of the individual,
but of society as a whole...

1265
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:55,300
...because medicine is now
a great social force.

1266
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:59,100
The individual is too small.

1267
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:10,100
That's the drug.

1268
01:40:10,700 --> 01:40:15,000
lt produces abdominal spasm
and peritoneal symptoms.

1269
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,700
lt must be very painful.

1270
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:21,400
lt's too bad.

1271
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:26,200
But look at it from
the practical standpoint.

1272
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:30,900
Somebody has to make these decisions.
We can't wait around forever.

1273
01:40:31,300 --> 01:40:33,500
lf society won't decide,
we'll decide.

1274
01:40:33,700 --> 01:40:35,500
We'll make the hard decisions.

1275
01:40:43,100 --> 01:40:44,700
This is Dr. Harris.

1276
01:40:44,900 --> 01:40:48,800
Schedule an emergency
appendectomy in O.R. 8.

1277
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:51,600
lt's a member of the house staff,
Dr. Wheeler.

1278
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:54,500
l've examined her.
She requires immediate surgery.

1279
01:40:54,700 --> 01:40:56,200
Okay, honey, now just sit up.

1280
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:58,900
Come on, that's it.
That's good.

1281
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:02,400
Here we go.

1282
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:04,400
lt's...

1283
01:41:04,700 --> 01:41:05,700
...the drug.

1284
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:09,700
Doctors make the worst patients.

1285
01:41:09,900 --> 01:41:11,900
They know too much, l guess.

1286
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:28,100
Why'd you run away?

1287
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:31,900
l was just talking to your mother.
She was worried about you.

1288
01:41:32,100 --> 01:41:34,300
Everybody's been worried about you.

1289
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:40,400
Honey, l love you.

1290
01:41:41,300 --> 01:41:42,700
You're gonna be just fine.

1291
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,700
No, Mark, listen.

1292
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,800
You have to stop this.

1293
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,600
l'm fine. l am.

1294
01:41:50,900 --> 01:41:53,100
But your appendix is not fine.

1295
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:56,700
You've got plus-four peritonitis,
guarding and spasm, honey.

1296
01:41:56,900 --> 01:41:58,700
Susan, you do.

1297
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,400
No, l don't.

1298
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:04,200
There's no question about it.

1299
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:11,400
Check my white count
and sed. rate. lt's normal.

1300
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:13,600
Please.

1301
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:23,700
The tests aren't here.

1302
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:28,900
But with these physical signs,
it has to be appendicitis.

1303
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:29,900
Please!

1304
01:42:30,100 --> 01:42:32,500
lt's better to be safe
and have the operation.

1305
01:42:33,100 --> 01:42:34,800
Besides, you're in the best of hands.

1306
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:38,400
Dr. Harris himself will do
the procedure. How about that?

1307
01:42:38,700 --> 01:42:40,600
The chief of surgery
is taking your case.

1308
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:42,000
l don't want him.

1309
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:45,800
-Well, how's our patient doing?
-Fine. Just slightly delirious.

1310
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,600
That's normal with appendicitis.

1311
01:42:48,900 --> 01:42:51,800
Besides, we all know doctors
make the worst patients.

1312
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:53,300
You gonna scrub in?

1313
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:56,900
Dr. Harris, we have O.R. 7
ready for your case.

1314
01:42:57,100 --> 01:42:58,900
l wanted O.R. 8.

1315
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:00,700
lt isn't ready yet.

1316
01:43:00,900 --> 01:43:05,400
-l specifically requested O.R. 8.
-lt'll take a couple of minutes.

1317
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:09,300
Well, hurry it up. Our patient
can't wait all night, can she?

1318
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:11,800
You scrubbing in?

1319
01:43:12,700 --> 01:43:15,600
Excuse me.
Let me just answer this page, sir.

1320
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:23,200
Yeah, this is Dr. Bellows.

1321
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:24,400
<i>Yes, Dr. Bellows.</i>

1322
01:43:24,700 --> 01:43:25,700
lt's that serious?

1323
01:43:26,100 --> 01:43:28,000
<i>Is what that serious?</i>

1324
01:43:28,200 --> 01:43:29,700
l'll be right there.

1325
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:31,500
<i>Dr. Bellows?</i>

1326
01:43:34,300 --> 01:43:36,100
We're ready in O.R. 8.

1327
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:37,800
We'll start at once.

1328
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:39,100
Bellows?

1329
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:41,500
Patient on surgical two's
got convulsions.

1330
01:43:41,700 --> 01:43:43,700
Join me as soon as you can.

1331
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,700
You can take her in.

1332
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:50,200
You certainly are lucky
with Dr. Harris doing the operation.

1333
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:52,900
Couldn't ask for a better man, huh?

1334
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:54,800
-l want--
-Now, now, just lie there.

1335
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:57,900
You're going to have a nice sleep.
Just relax.

1336
01:43:58,300 --> 01:44:00,100
Easy, we'll take good care of you.

1337
01:44:01,100 --> 01:44:04,400
<i>I found the oxygen line.</i>
<i>It starts in the basement...</i>

1338
01:44:04,600 --> 01:44:06,500
<i>...and it goes up the main tunnel...</i>

1339
01:44:06,700 --> 01:44:10,200
<i>...and then it plugs in the ceiling</i>
<i>that goes to O.R. 8.</i>

1340
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:16,800
Do we have enough sponges?

1341
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:20,700
We better order some more
4-0 Chromex. We're almost out.

1342
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:43,900
We have to do this one right.

1343
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:49,400
House officers deserve the very best
of care in their own hospital.

1344
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:58,000
l'm giving you Pentothal.
Take some good, deep breaths, dear.

1345
01:45:00,100 --> 01:45:01,500
ln and out.

1346
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:24,300
The patient's film.

1347
01:45:25,100 --> 01:45:26,700
They look normal, don't they?

1348
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:31,300
Pity acute appendicitis doesn't
show up more clearly in the x-rays.

1349
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,400
She has an inny.

1350
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:41,800
A what?

1351
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,500
An inny. The bellybutton.

1352
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:47,400
Some are innies, some are outties.
Hers is an inny.

1353
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:08,200
Let me know when she's fully under.

1354
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:15,300
She's ready for you.

1355
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:16,900
Scalpel, please.

1356
01:47:03,900 --> 01:47:04,800
What's that?

1357
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,600
lt's a PVC.

1358
01:47:08,300 --> 01:47:09,300
There's another one.

1359
01:47:09,900 --> 01:47:11,100
Too light?

1360
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:12,700
l don't think so, sir.

1361
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:15,200
Maybe you'd better deepen anesthesia.

1362
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,500
Blood pressure's dropping.
l don't understand.

1363
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:31,000
Want me to stop?

1364
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:33,800
lt'll be all right.

1365
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:38,500
-l'll be happy to stop a moment.
-lt's okay, Dr. Harris.

1366
01:47:38,900 --> 01:47:40,200
You recommend l go on?

1367
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:59,100
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!

1368
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:02,600
Here it is.

1369
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:08,000
Looks normal.
Never know it from her symptoms.

1370
01:48:08,300 --> 01:48:11,200
lt's nice to see the chief
get caught sometimes.

1371
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,500
Happens to the best of us.

1372
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:31,400
All right.

1373
01:48:33,100 --> 01:48:35,000
-You can bring her out now.
-Right.

1374
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:46,600
She's not coming around.

1375
01:48:46,900 --> 01:48:50,000
Just give her a minute.
l'm sure she'll be fine.

1376
01:48:50,200 --> 01:48:51,200
l don't know.

1377
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:04,300
She's okay, sir.

1378
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:07,000
She's just fine, Dr. Harris.

1379
01:49:07,400 --> 01:49:08,900
Nice case, Dr. Harris.

1380
01:49:53,900 --> 01:49:56,600
-Don't let him do the operation.
-l know, baby.

1381
01:49:57,300 --> 01:49:58,700
l know.

1382
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:17,000
We're waiting for you, Dr. Harris.

1383
01:50:18,305 --> 01:50:24,748
