00:00:33,453 --> 00:00:36,656
- Whoa, baby.
- You caught nothing.

3
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:39,826
You're gonna have to move away.

4
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:43,043
We don't want no cheap-seaters
around the table.

5
00:00:43,171 --> 00:00:48,165
- If Kenny's movin', you've got to move.
- You follow him, Bobby.

6
00:00:48,301 --> 00:00:51,302
Would you go
if you had the chance again?

7
00:00:51,429 --> 00:00:54,098
- Would I go? Yeah.
- You'd go to Canada?

8
00:00:54,223 --> 00:00:56,512
- No, not to Canada.
- You'd go back to 'Nam?

9
00:00:56,642 --> 00:00:58,682
- Yeah, because...
- You would?

10
00:00:58,811 --> 00:01:00,851
- You're a fucking psycho!
- No.

11
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,559
- You'd go back?
- Yeah. I went over for a purpose, man.

12
00:01:05,693 --> 00:01:08,647
- What was your purpose?
- A lot of it was curiosity.

13
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,564
- But another thing was...
- You can't be curious, man.

14
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,695
I said that was just part of the reason.
The other was a moral obligation.

15
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:25,126
I feel that anybody... Not for their country
or anything like that. For anybody.

16
00:01:25,254 --> 00:01:29,382
Nobody's got the right to tell anybody
what to do against their will.

17
00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:32,047
That's what I went over to fight for.

18
00:01:32,178 --> 00:01:37,219
Did you know that they ran the French
out of there after 20 years?

19
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,854
Wait a minute. You said they're forcing...?
Shit! You call the draft not being forced?

20
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,020
I ain't sayin' the draft in our country.

21
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:50,274
I'm talking about another country that's
having something forced upon them.

22
00:01:50,404 --> 00:01:55,991
- Is it our duty to fight for somebody else?
- If you believe in it! If you believe in it.

23
00:01:56,118 --> 00:02:02,157
I can't see anybody saying that,
after coming back, they would go again.

24
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:04,450
I just can't deal with that.

25
00:02:04,585 --> 00:02:09,543
Wait a minute. The reason I can see it
is that some of us, not all of us,

26
00:02:09,674 --> 00:02:14,632
some of us need to justify to ourselves
what the fuck we did there.

27
00:02:14,762 --> 00:02:20,005
If we come back and say what we did
was a waste, some of us can't live with it.

28
00:02:20,143 --> 00:02:23,558
- So they'd do it again?
- Man, they gotta keep...

29
00:02:23,688 --> 00:02:26,772
Inside they're lying to themselves
continuously saying

30
00:02:26,899 --> 00:02:31,312
"What I did was OK
because this is what I got from it, man."

31
00:02:31,445 --> 00:02:36,688
"I have to justify being paralysed, I have to
justify killing people, so I say it was OK."

32
00:02:36,826 --> 00:02:39,696
But how many guys
can make the reality and say

33
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:44,206
"What I did was wrong
and all this other shit was wrong, man"

34
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:48,794
and be able to live with themselves cos
they're crippled for the rest of their life?

35
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,708
<i>You don't know what's going on</i>

36

<i>My poor discarded baby</i>

40
00:03:12,695 --> 00:03:18,614

41
00:03:20,286 --> 00:03:27,333
<i>Well, baby, baby, baby,</i>
<i>you're out of time</i>

42
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:33,996
<i>I said, baby, baby, baby,</i>
<i>you're out of time</i>

43
00:03:34,425 --> 00:03:37,130
<i>You are all left out</i>

44
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:42,808
<i>Out of there without a doubt</i>

45
00:03:42,934 --> 00:03:48,094
<i>Cos baby, baby, baby,</i>

<i>You're out of touch, my baby</i>

50
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:13,545
<i>My poor unfaithful baby</i>

51
00:04:13,673 --> 00:04:18,833
<i>I said, baby, baby, baby,</i>
<i>you're out of time</i>

<i>Well, baby, baby, baby,</i>

00:05:03,848 --> 00:05:06,090
<i>Oh, no</i>

61
00:05:06,225 --> 00:05:09,808
<i>You're obsolete, my baby</i>

62
00:05:09,937 --> 00:05:13,555

<i>Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time</i>...

70
00:06:03,783 --> 00:06:06,155
<i>Re-box all weapons.</i>

71

<i>Place your weapons on the firing line</i>

<i>Grease up the brass</i>...

73
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:15,499
Word is it's turning into
a hell of a war over there, Captain.

74
00:06:15,628 --> 00:06:20,788
We're going there, pal.
When we're in 'Nam, we're in Combat City.

75
00:06:20,925 --> 00:06:24,341
I am ready. Really ready.

76
00:06:25,805 --> 00:06:28,841
I'll pop some rounds with you. Marine!

77
00:06:30,392 --> 00:06:35,101
- How's Vi taken to your leaving?
- I think she hates everything military.

78
00:06:35,231 --> 00:06:39,275
But she stands behind me.
She knows I want it more than anything.

79
00:06:39,401 --> 00:06:42,237
- How about Sally?
- She's OK.

80
00:06:42,363 --> 00:06:46,989
I don't think she really understands it all,
but she accepts it.

81
00:06:48,077 --> 00:06:51,197
You can't ask
for a helluva lot more than that.

82
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:58,833
<i>An American spokesman reported</i>
<i>rockets, artillery and mortar fire...</i>

83
00:06:58,963 --> 00:07:01,667
- Jeez!
- Remember Jim Hanson?

84
00:07:02,883 --> 00:07:07,130
He got blown away
in the middle of the street right in Saigon.

85
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:12,304
That's an embarrassment.
Makes us look like the goddamn B Team.

86
00:07:12,434 --> 00:07:16,266
Word is from on top that Charlie
shot his wad with this Tet Offensive

87
00:07:16,397 --> 00:07:19,481
and it's just a matter of a mop-up time.

88
00:07:19,608 --> 00:07:22,977
I've waited a long time
for an opportunity like this.

89
00:07:23,112 --> 00:07:25,270
You're gonna make major.

90
00:07:26,615 --> 00:07:28,240
- Major?
- Major.

91
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:34,655
Major and Mrs Robert Hyde? I'll have
to get my skirts lengthened for that one.

92
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,830
Start wearing girdles.

93
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:42,250
- You'll have to watch your language.
- Right. Very reserved.

94
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:47,883
I'm actually excited.
I never thought it would get like this.

95
00:07:48,012 --> 00:07:54,513
I have competitive nervousness.
I feel like I'm off to the Olympic Games.

96
00:07:54,643 --> 00:07:56,683
Bob is very sexy.

97
00:07:56,812 --> 00:07:59,386
In 13 months I'll throw you
the damnedest party.

98
00:07:59,523 --> 00:08:02,809
We'll have a side of beef,
a case of Jack Daniels,

99
00:08:02,943 --> 00:08:05,980
and maybe I'll even get you
a couple of congressmen.

100
00:08:06,113 --> 00:08:07,691
Fantastic.

101
00:08:07,823 --> 00:08:10,907
- I'll bring you back a souvenir.
- Like what?

102
00:08:11,035 --> 00:08:13,822
A Commie AK-47.

103
00:08:13,954 --> 00:08:17,323
- Robert? Sorry to interrupt.
- Mrs Vickery.

104
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:20,127
I wanted to pass on
the Colonel's best wishes.

105
00:08:20,252 --> 00:08:24,748
- Isn't he able to come by later?
- No. Tonight's his chess night.

106
00:08:24,882 --> 00:08:29,674
- Sally, be sure to keep in touch.
- I will, Mrs Vickery.

107
00:08:29,803 --> 00:08:32,473
- She'll be staying with my mom.
- Oh, nice.

108
00:08:32,598 --> 00:08:36,049
Earl, your Kathy's doing
a wonderful job on the paper.

109
00:08:36,185 --> 00:08:40,811
- Don't let it go to your head, young lady.
- I've got a lot of good ideas.

110
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,979
Call me tomorrow.

111
00:08:44,526 --> 00:08:47,693
- May God be with you, Robert.
- Thank you, Mrs Vickery.

112
00:08:51,408 --> 00:08:53,448
That was very nice.

00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:08,882

Now hear this!

119
00:09:14,598 --> 00:09:20,304
It is exactly zero hour minus six.

120
00:09:20,437 --> 00:09:24,221
Your orders for the day are:

121
00:09:24,358 --> 00:09:29,518
Go directly to the bedroom.

122
00:09:31,198 --> 00:09:34,947
Do not pass "Go".

123
00:09:35,077 --> 00:09:39,122
Do not collect dinner.

124
00:09:40,624 --> 00:09:44,040
- Aren't you hungry?
- Well...

125
00:09:44,169 --> 00:09:47,455
Does a bear make big potty in the woods?

126
00:09:49,883 --> 00:09:54,592
From the Halls of Montezuma
to the shores of Tripoli...

127
00:09:58,058 --> 00:10:00,596
I will fight...

128
00:10:02,396 --> 00:10:05,480
my country's battles...

129
00:10:07,568 --> 00:10:10,403
on land,

130
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:12,652
in the air...

131
00:10:33,761 --> 00:10:35,800
Bob?

132
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,556
What are you doing?

133
00:10:41,685 --> 00:10:44,770
This darn thing wouldn't pop up.

134
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:50,437
You never know
when you're gonna want some toast.

135
00:11:00,954 --> 00:11:03,410
I gotta start getting ready.

136
00:11:04,792 --> 00:11:08,243
You don't need to be afraid
for me, you know.

137
00:11:09,797 --> 00:11:12,003
I <i>am</i> afraid.

138
00:11:13,842 --> 00:11:16,084
But I'm proud of you.

139
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,134
There was nothing I could do
here in California.

140
00:11:20,265 --> 00:11:22,305
I know.

141
00:11:23,977 --> 00:11:28,390
That's where I belong. And I am a Marine.

142
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:35,109
I gotta go. Pay the bar bill.

143
00:11:35,239 --> 00:11:38,904
And let's get the generator
in this thing fixed.

144
00:11:39,034 --> 00:11:42,118
And call my mom and let her know
when you're coming.

145
00:11:42,246 --> 00:11:46,908
- I bought you a present, sweetheart.
- I don't have anything for you.

146
00:11:54,091 --> 00:11:57,590
Oh, Sally. It's a little wedding ring.

147
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,553
Look how outstanding that is. Huh?

148
00:12:04,685 --> 00:12:06,724
I like it.

149
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,226
- You'll probably take it off on liberty.
- No way.

150
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,776
I'll never take this off. That's a promise.

151
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,653
- This'll be my good-luck charm.
- That's right.

152
00:12:22,786 --> 00:12:26,404
Sir? We're ready to move out.
Can I stow your gear?

153
00:12:27,624 --> 00:12:30,162
- We're at war.
- Yo!

154
00:12:33,505 --> 00:12:35,545
Let's go.

155
00:12:36,842 --> 00:12:41,753
When I get back, we're gonna get us
a little condominium right on the beach.

156
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:43,965
Tell brother Billy to take care.

157
00:12:44,099 --> 00:12:48,227
- And a garage filled up with Porsches.
- Be a good girl. No fooling around.

158
00:12:48,353 --> 00:12:51,604
- Just come back.
- You got it.

159
00:12:51,732 --> 00:12:54,649
Oh. This is Dink. My wife Sally.

160
00:12:54,777 --> 00:12:59,023
Hello, Mrs Hyde. Vi, Captain Hyde's wife.

161
00:12:59,156 --> 00:13:01,195
Hi, Vi.

162
00:13:02,618 --> 00:13:05,025
Be careful.

163
00:13:05,162 --> 00:13:07,914
- You have a spot on your tie.
- What?

164
00:13:21,094 --> 00:13:23,764
Don't wear your skirts so short.

165
00:13:50,832 --> 00:13:52,872
See you around.

166
00:14:04,721 --> 00:14:06,548
- Hey, Vi?
- Yeah?

167
00:14:06,682 --> 00:14:09,967
Do you want a drink?
Can I buy you a drink or something?

168
00:14:10,102 --> 00:14:12,141
Where's open? No place is open.

169
00:14:12,271 --> 00:14:15,770
- Just the Officers Club.
- Any place but there.

170
00:14:19,403 --> 00:14:21,479
Yeah, I guess.

171
00:14:22,447 --> 00:14:25,733
Well... that's that.

172
00:14:34,543 --> 00:14:38,623
Hey. I live just a couple of miles down.
Wanna come over?

173
00:14:38,755 --> 00:14:41,044
- Yeah.
- Stay close.

174
00:14:48,765 --> 00:14:52,099
- Park in there. It's empty.
- OK.

175
00:15:01,695 --> 00:15:05,858
Don't mind the mess. Come on up.

176
00:15:17,377 --> 00:15:19,417
Don't turn it off.

177
00:15:43,862 --> 00:15:45,902
OK?

178
00:15:46,031 --> 00:15:51,701
Yeah. Sorry. Just tonight especially,
I felt superstitious.

179
00:15:51,828 --> 00:15:54,913
Whatever gets you through the night.

180
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,038
- I guess it's the way I was brought up.
- Me too. Is beer OK? It's all I got.

181
00:15:59,169 --> 00:16:01,209
Oh, sure.

182
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,971
You gonna stay on in officers' quarters?

183
00:16:12,099 --> 00:16:15,016
Are you kidding?
I couldn't even if I wanted to.

184
00:16:15,143 --> 00:16:18,393
- That's spooky.
- Bob moves off and I've gotta move.

185
00:16:18,522 --> 00:16:22,519
You're the hole in the doughnut, and
when the doughnut goes, there's no hole.

186
00:16:22,651 --> 00:16:28,404
They say if the Marine Corps wanted you
to have a wife they'd have issued you one.

187
00:16:28,532 --> 00:16:31,201
- Is that you?
- Me and my kid brother.

188
00:16:31,326 --> 00:16:32,951
He's cute.

189
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:37,407
He inherited the brains,
the beauty, the personality, the talent.

190
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,165
Then he got drafted.

191
00:16:39,292 --> 00:16:41,700
He's the main reason I hang out here.

192
00:16:41,837 --> 00:16:43,876
- Not Dink?
- Dink the kink?

193
00:16:45,173 --> 00:16:51,093
He's part of it. But the kid's
in the VA hospital - psycho ward.

194
00:16:51,221 --> 00:16:55,883
They sent him home without an ignition.
So I'm stuck with him.

195
00:16:56,977 --> 00:17:00,346
God. It must be really hard on you.

196
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,893
I see him every day.
I work in the hospital, in the kitchen.

197
00:17:05,026 --> 00:17:07,814
Is he gonna get better?

198
00:17:07,946 --> 00:17:10,781
Who knows? They don't.

199
00:17:10,907 --> 00:17:12,865
I don't.

200
00:17:26,757 --> 00:17:29,757
- Hey, Pee Wee.
- How are you doing, Mr Martin?

201
00:17:29,885 --> 00:17:33,882
I'm just fine, Pee Wee. Just terrific.
I only stink a <i>little</i> bit.

202
00:17:34,014 --> 00:17:36,968
- Smells like booze to me.
- I need a bath, man.

203
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,185
I just have two hands
and too many assholes to clean.

204
00:17:40,312 --> 00:17:42,351
That's what you're being paid for.

205
00:17:42,481 --> 00:17:45,766
Mr Martin, you get more from Uncle
for your disability

206
00:17:45,901 --> 00:17:48,189
than me and my old lady get put together.

207
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,902
Maybe they shouldn't
put you together, then.

208
00:17:52,032 --> 00:17:55,116
- Your radiator's blowing over.
- So's yours, Eddie.

209
00:17:55,243 --> 00:18:00,404
I'm serious, man. You better watch it
before you pop your melon.

210
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:04,158
Oh, shit. I'm filled up. Where's Corinne?

211
00:18:09,174 --> 00:18:12,792
You better watch that booze.
Mess up your kidneys.

212
00:18:29,653 --> 00:18:33,318
Watch where you're...! Goddamnit! Shit!

213
00:18:33,448 --> 00:18:36,402
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, my God!

214
00:18:38,078 --> 00:18:41,447
Would you please give me my canes?

215
00:18:41,581 --> 00:18:43,621
I'm sorry.

216
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,790
Goddamnit!

217
00:18:47,003 --> 00:18:54,050
Nurses, interns and orderlies!
Fucking nurses and fucking doctors!

218
00:18:54,177 --> 00:18:57,712
They treat us like nobodies
in this fucking hospital!

219
00:18:57,848 --> 00:19:01,548
- Goddamn it! Where are you people?
- Give it hell, Luke.

220
00:19:01,685 --> 00:19:06,347
Corinne, you're fucking late!
There's something on the floor for you!

221
00:19:06,481 --> 00:19:09,316
You stay where you are, Digroot!

222
00:19:09,442 --> 00:19:14,151
You come near me, I'll break
your fucking head! You understand?

223
00:19:14,281 --> 00:19:17,946
Where the fuck were you? You're
so goddamned slow. Can't you move?

224
00:19:18,076 --> 00:19:22,537
Come near me! I wanna hit you! I wanna
hit something that can't fucking move!

225
00:19:22,664 --> 00:19:24,704
What am I saying?

226
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:27,288
What am I doing?

227
00:19:30,172 --> 00:19:33,256
- Having a little problem today, Luke?
- Oh, shit!

228
00:19:33,383 --> 00:19:36,004
Doctor, I can't even
get my piss bag changed!

229
00:19:36,136 --> 00:19:39,587
- You want me out of this hospital?
- Give him 50 of Thorazine.

230
00:19:39,723 --> 00:19:45,808
Take care of me and I'll get the fuck
out of here! Just take care of me!

231
00:19:47,272 --> 00:19:52,183
Fucking hospital! Aw, shit!

232
00:19:59,576 --> 00:20:04,368
<i>Put me on a train</i>

233
00:20:04,497 --> 00:20:09,705
<i>I've got no expectations</i>...

234
00:20:11,713 --> 00:20:14,584
- Are you Fleta Wilson?
- Yes.

235
00:20:14,716 --> 00:20:20,635
I think I'd like to volunteer. I mean,
I don't think, I do want to volunteer.

236
00:20:20,764 --> 00:20:22,258
Damn.

237
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:26,305
Sit down, please.
I'll be with you in a minute.

238
00:20:31,149 --> 00:20:33,189
Hot stuff.

239
00:20:47,832 --> 00:20:50,205
- Do you have him, Jerry?
- Yeah.

240
00:20:50,335 --> 00:20:52,374
One, two, three.

241
00:20:58,551 --> 00:21:02,549
Yeah, I know what you mean.
But you'll get used to it.

242
00:21:02,681 --> 00:21:06,595
One guy had "Born to lose"
tattooed on his arm.

243
00:21:06,726 --> 00:21:09,893
<i>"La vida loca"</i> - the crazy life.
That's my favourite one.

244
00:21:10,021 --> 00:21:12,856
I talked to this other guy
that had a gold earring.

245
00:21:12,983 --> 00:21:17,111
Yeah? You're not used
to those hippy types, huh?

246
00:21:17,237 --> 00:21:21,566
Bob would flip out
if he ever saw those characters.

247
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:25,451
That about does it, huh?

248
00:21:25,578 --> 00:21:30,287
I feel like I've lived in base houses
all my life.

249
00:21:32,877 --> 00:21:34,953
Should've had the government move us.

250
00:21:35,088 --> 00:21:38,539
- They do that for officers, you know?
- Yeah?

251
00:21:38,675 --> 00:21:42,423
I didn't realise that we'd accumulated
so much stuff.

252
00:21:42,554 --> 00:21:46,219
Well, don't worry. My rates are cheap.

253
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:52,762
You know, I think I must have moved
at least 15 times since I left home.

254
00:21:52,897 --> 00:21:57,440
I went back there once
when my old lady died.

255
00:21:57,569 --> 00:22:02,112
Nothing's left. They tore down my past
and built a shopping centre.

256
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,407
- Want to see something funny?
- I'd love to.

257
00:22:05,535 --> 00:22:07,575
My yearbook.

258
00:22:10,707 --> 00:22:13,827
- Ooh! Look at that dress.
- It was a nice dress.

259
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,166
- It's cute.
- There's another one here.

260
00:22:16,296 --> 00:22:18,668
So funny looking at
the way we used to look.

261
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:22,048
- Doggy in the window?
- Look.

262
00:22:24,012 --> 00:22:27,345
"Sally Bender. Nickname: Sal."

263
00:22:28,683 --> 00:22:32,515
"What is the one thing
she'd want on a desert island?"

264
00:22:32,645 --> 00:22:34,852
"A husband."

265
00:22:34,981 --> 00:22:38,682
- I was so ambitious.
- And so original.

266
00:22:38,818 --> 00:22:42,686
You know that guy we were talking about?
He's in here somewhere.

267
00:22:42,822 --> 00:22:45,064
- Yeah?
- Look.

268
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,773
"Luke Martin. Nickname: The Duke."

269
00:22:47,911 --> 00:22:51,196
- He's cute.
- "Co-captain of the football team."

270
00:22:51,331 --> 00:22:55,744
"What one thing would he want
on a desert island? A mirror."

271
00:22:55,877 --> 00:23:00,586
- This is asinine, Pee Wee.
- There you go. Take some.

272
00:23:00,715 --> 00:23:04,962
Don't you get the feeling
that this is kinda silly shit?

273
00:23:13,144 --> 00:23:17,890
Shit, I'm not saying
this isn't entertaining, Pee Wee.

274
00:23:19,651 --> 00:23:23,067
I'm not eating, Pee Wee. I'm not eating.

275
00:23:24,572 --> 00:23:27,776
I'm not eating, Pee Wee. Come on, man.

276
00:23:27,909 --> 00:23:32,785
Give me my arms. I can feed myself.
This is bullshit. I'm not a child, man.

277
00:23:32,914 --> 00:23:34,954
Drink the milk.

278
00:23:48,388 --> 00:23:51,472
- Hi there.
- Hello.

279
00:24:00,358 --> 00:24:02,398
Juice and coffee!

280
00:24:03,361 --> 00:24:05,401
Want some juice?

281
00:24:08,324 --> 00:24:11,409
Excuse me. Do you want
some juice or coffee?

282
00:24:12,579 --> 00:24:15,615
- Juice or coffee?
- Look at that round-eyed chick!

283
00:24:15,748 --> 00:24:17,788
Come on, baby, light my fire.

284
00:24:19,419 --> 00:24:23,582
- Wanna boom-boom? Short time?
- Like some juice?

285
00:24:23,715 --> 00:24:26,502
I'm hard all over.
I'm a bargain in this ward.

286
00:24:26,634 --> 00:24:30,086
Hey, man, be cool. I told you.
Get yourself together.

287
00:24:30,221 --> 00:24:35,346
- Do you want some juice?
- Tits... ass... You got it all, Mama-san.

288
00:24:35,476 --> 00:24:38,181
- You got it all.
- Hey, you shut up.

289
00:24:38,313 --> 00:24:43,817
Yes, sir. Right away. You hear that?
You're disturbing these young 'uns.

290
00:24:43,943 --> 00:24:47,395
Can I kiss you? Can I sniff? Oh, man.

291
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,990
Luke?

292
00:24:54,913 --> 00:24:56,952
Can I come in?

293
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:02,201
How are you doing?

294
00:25:08,051 --> 00:25:12,048
- Do you remember me?
- No.

295
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,671
I was at Lincoln High
when you were there.

296
00:25:14,807 --> 00:25:19,766
Sally Hyde. Well, I was Sally Bender
when... when I was there.

297
00:25:21,773 --> 00:25:23,812
So?

298
00:25:28,321 --> 00:25:30,693
I just started volunteering today here.

299
00:25:30,823 --> 00:25:34,868
Terrific. If I could get my hands loose,
I'd salute you.

300
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,040
You're a mess.

301
00:25:46,047 --> 00:25:48,620
- Sally Bender.
- Right.

302
00:25:50,426 --> 00:25:55,088
- You were a cheerleader.
- That's right. Three years.

303
00:26:00,853 --> 00:26:04,139
- Were you wounded in 'Nam?
- Right.

304
00:26:04,274 --> 00:26:06,978
When did it happen?

305
00:26:08,987 --> 00:26:11,026
A long time ago.

306
00:26:13,825 --> 00:26:18,368
- My husband just went over there.
- Poor bastard.

307
00:26:31,426 --> 00:26:33,465
Sally?

308
00:26:34,721 --> 00:26:38,339
Didn't we used to call you Bender Over?

309
00:26:38,474 --> 00:26:42,686
- What? Who said that?
- Bender Over. Everybody said it.

310
00:26:42,812 --> 00:26:45,813
- They did not!
- Yes, they did, Sally.

311
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,689
Oh, come on. They did not.
What are you talking about?

312
00:26:49,819 --> 00:26:51,859
Oh, shit.

313
00:26:51,988 --> 00:26:55,155
Sally, listen.
Can I ask you for a big favour?

314
00:26:55,283 --> 00:26:57,322
Sure.

315
00:26:57,452 --> 00:27:01,532
How about unhitching me
from these things?

316
00:27:02,832 --> 00:27:05,916
- No, I can't do that, Luke.
- Sure you can. It's easy.

317
00:27:06,044 --> 00:27:09,993
No, I'm sorry. The doctor
has to do that. I...

318
00:27:10,131 --> 00:27:13,547
Come on. Please? Please, Sally Bender.

319
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:20,928
- Come on.
- What are you doing in here?

320
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:24,262
- I just was seeing...
- We'll tend to Mr Martin, Sally.

321
00:27:24,395 --> 00:27:27,182
- You're needed on the ward.
- OK.

322
00:27:28,941 --> 00:27:33,153
Hey, Bender.
You almost got yourself a gold star.

323
00:27:41,454 --> 00:27:43,696
Pee Wee, I can crawl again.

324
00:27:52,006 --> 00:27:54,046
Morning.

325
00:27:55,677 --> 00:28:01,382
I'm gonna be feeding you this morning.
I'm a new volunteer here.

326
00:28:01,516 --> 00:28:03,555
Huh?

327
00:28:06,604 --> 00:28:12,191
He ain't transistorised, honey.
You gotta plug him in for sound.

328
00:28:12,318 --> 00:28:14,358
Plug you in? Oh.

329
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:22,321
Is this... is this gonna hurt?

330
00:28:25,832 --> 00:28:28,038
There. Is that OK?

331
00:28:29,252 --> 00:28:32,668
- Thank you.
- OK. Would you like some food?

332
00:28:33,756 --> 00:28:36,591
Hey, there you go. Oh, my.

333
00:28:36,717 --> 00:28:38,757
- I'm sorry.
- That's OK.

334
00:28:38,886 --> 00:28:40,926
You want me to...? Here.

335
00:28:41,055 --> 00:28:43,095
Here. Here you go.

336
00:28:45,685 --> 00:28:48,555
It's all energy. You understand?

337
00:28:49,772 --> 00:28:53,224
You don't understand.
You give out energy, you get energy back.

338
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:57,191
You see me smiling?
Can you dig them pearly whites?

339
00:28:57,321 --> 00:29:00,239
I smile my ass off now.

340
00:29:00,366 --> 00:29:04,494
Hell, sometimes I think
I'm the Good Humor Man.

341
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:08,748
Everyone wants a piece of my action.
They think I'm one of the Beach Boys.

342
00:29:08,875 --> 00:29:13,335
- Hey, Sally. This is my brother, Bill.
- Hi, Bill.

343
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:19,882
You see that? Me and her just had
a whole conversation in smile contact.

344
00:29:20,011 --> 00:29:24,305
- Vi, do you have a jumper cable?
- Sure. Bridges!

345
00:29:24,432 --> 00:29:26,471
Watch. You watching?

346
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:33,980
You two just did it. You smiled
"See what I have to put up with?"

347
00:29:34,108 --> 00:29:36,148
And she smiled back "He's harmless."

348
00:29:36,277 --> 00:29:38,483
- Are you on uppers?
- I don't know.

349
00:29:38,613 --> 00:29:42,029
Come on, Bill.
How about a game of chess?

350
00:29:44,243 --> 00:29:47,861
My brother -
a miracle of modern medicine.

351
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:56,327
Hey, wait. Oh, my God, what a day.
Is he usually like that?

352
00:30:03,763 --> 00:30:05,174
Try it!

353
00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:10,098
Is it charging?

354
00:30:14,815 --> 00:30:16,689
No.

355
00:30:16,817 --> 00:30:21,776
I like this one.
This is beautiful. It's a convertible.

356
00:30:23,032 --> 00:30:29,781
I don't know how you'd keep warm.
Oh, it's got a great sound system.

357
00:30:29,914 --> 00:30:31,112
Hello.

358
00:30:31,249 --> 00:30:35,163
- Why is this one so much less expensive?
- It's two years older.

359
00:30:35,294 --> 00:30:41,463
"I'm so tired when I come home at night,
I just fall right asleep."

360
00:30:41,592 --> 00:30:44,427
"I know you didn't want me
to get a job..." Thanks.

361
00:30:44,554 --> 00:30:51,600
"...but this isn't really a job, since
I don't get paid. I hope you don't mind."

362
00:30:51,727 --> 00:30:56,639
Then there's sort of a sexy ending.
"Love, Sally."

363
00:30:56,774 --> 00:30:59,443
- That's nice.
- Thanks.

364
00:31:01,821 --> 00:31:06,483
But you didn't tell him the house
you rented was on the beach.

365
00:31:06,617 --> 00:31:08,491
I know.

366
00:31:09,537 --> 00:31:13,237
And you didn't tell him
about the new car you bought.

367
00:31:13,374 --> 00:31:17,123
I figure I'm gonna save that
for when he gets home.

368
00:31:19,422 --> 00:31:23,254
- I got one from Dink this morning.
- Oh, yeah?

369
00:31:23,384 --> 00:31:28,461
All he said was "Got you another ear."
Poetic, huh?

370
00:31:29,765 --> 00:31:35,352
A captain? Shit, Bender. You didn't
go out and marry a fucking captain?

371
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:38,813
That's right. Why? What were you?

372
00:31:38,941 --> 00:31:40,981
A sergeant.

373
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:44,313
Sergeants have a lot
of responsibility, don't they?

374
00:31:44,447 --> 00:31:47,448
Yes. They sent me my stripes
on the hospital ship.

375
00:31:47,575 --> 00:31:50,576
My reward for getting so fucked up!

376
00:31:51,412 --> 00:31:54,828
Why are you so cynical about that, Luke?

377
00:31:56,292 --> 00:31:59,827
What are you doing here, Bender?
Why aren't you on a golf course?

378
00:31:59,962 --> 00:32:02,749
Doing something you're good at.

379
00:32:02,882 --> 00:32:04,921
I'm just trying to keep busy.

380
00:32:05,051 --> 00:32:07,506
Sure. Something
to talk about over martinis.

381
00:32:07,637 --> 00:32:10,922
How you're helping out the poor cripples.

382
00:32:13,142 --> 00:32:16,593
I don't think that
I deserve that, Luke - at all.

383
00:32:16,729 --> 00:32:21,687
Maybe you're getting ready for your
husband to come back in a body bag.

384
00:32:28,199 --> 00:32:30,026
Read someplace else!

385
00:32:32,745 --> 00:32:34,784
Luke?

386
00:32:34,997 --> 00:32:37,037
Luke.

387
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:42,745
Stop! Stop and listen to me!

388
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,172
What is the matter with you?

389
00:32:52,682 --> 00:32:55,386
Why do you have to be such a bastard?

390
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:12,814
Kevin. I thought
you died Wednesday, man.

391
00:33:12,952 --> 00:33:17,495
You can get paralysed in a war
that don't even make sense

392
00:33:17,623 --> 00:33:21,952
and come back and they don't have
the decency to ask you how you're doing.

393
00:33:22,086 --> 00:33:24,209
"Can I do anything for you?"

394
00:33:24,338 --> 00:33:29,629
I got a Purple Heart. I got it from a second
lieutenant that wasn't even in the war.

395
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,845
They don't tell you about
how to manage your finances.

396
00:33:32,972 --> 00:33:37,301
Or going back into society. Half
the people still can't go back into society.

397
00:33:37,435 --> 00:33:41,135
What about your sex life?
They don't tell you about that.

398
00:33:41,272 --> 00:33:44,059
I went out the first time
and didn't know what to do.

399
00:33:44,191 --> 00:33:48,770
What happens if my gizmo busts? What
happens if I have a bowel movement?

400
00:33:48,904 --> 00:33:51,360
I get there and I don't know how to react.

401
00:33:52,241 --> 00:33:55,028
There's not enough beds,
not enough staff.

402
00:33:55,161 --> 00:33:58,031
It's really crowded.
The guys have to wait in line.

403
00:33:58,164 --> 00:34:01,663
They're not prepared for the number
of wounded being sent back.

404
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:05,292
I don't think we're clear
on what you're asking us for, Sally.

405
00:34:07,173 --> 00:34:12,629
It's what I said. We could do an article
in the paper, using these photographs,

406
00:34:12,762 --> 00:34:15,217
interviewing some of the guys, maybe.

407
00:34:15,347 --> 00:34:18,099
Isn't it difficult for the men
to be around women?

408
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:21,594
When I joined Weight Watchers
I didn't want candy in the house.

409
00:34:21,729 --> 00:34:24,136
I don't think that's our function, Sally.

410
00:34:24,273 --> 00:34:28,022
We're more a base gossip sheet.
Fun and games for the fellas.

411
00:34:28,152 --> 00:34:32,814
I agree with you, Connie.
I'm sorry, Sally. I hope you understand.

412
00:34:32,948 --> 00:34:36,697
What's next in the agenda?

413
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:42,201
We have the Little League play-offs
and the officer-son baseball game.

414
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:45,868
That's the 25th and the 27th, isn't it?

415
00:34:46,003 --> 00:34:49,123
I just... I want to say
that I'm really shocked

416
00:34:49,256 --> 00:34:53,503
that you'd rather write about
a goddamn home run than this hospital.

417
00:34:53,636 --> 00:34:57,550
- Sally, please.
- What if they were your husbands?

418
00:35:04,271 --> 00:35:07,142
<i>That sure is a mindblower!</i>

419
00:35:07,274 --> 00:35:10,026
<i>That's the way it was done 150 years ago</i>.

420
00:35:10,152 --> 00:35:14,197
- <i>Things have improved</i>.
- <i>They certainly have</i>.

421
00:35:14,323 --> 00:35:20,741
<i>Picture a young man 150 years ago</i>
<i>in the beautiful hills of Kentucky</i>.

422
00:35:20,871 --> 00:35:24,205
<i>There's a girl he's crazy about</i>.
<i>She's lovely, vivacious</i>...

423
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:26,824
What's shaking, man?

424
00:35:26,961 --> 00:35:32,335
One of them days, man.
Flashback to when I got fucked up.

425
00:35:34,969 --> 00:35:37,008
<i>Wow!</i>

426
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,430
<i>Get out of the way!</i>

427
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:58,107
<i>Nobody feels any pain</i>

428
00:35:59,952 --> 00:36:04,329
<i>Tonight as I stand inside the rain</i>

429
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:09,168
<i>Everybody knows</i>

430
00:36:09,295 --> 00:36:12,379
<i>That baby's got new clothes</i>...

431
00:36:14,008 --> 00:36:21,635
<i>He dedicated himself to justice and</i>
<i>love between his fellow human beings</i>.

432
00:36:23,934 --> 00:36:26,223
<i>He gave his life for that principle</i>

433
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:30,896
<i>and I think it's up to those of us</i>
<i>who are here</i>...

434
00:36:35,029 --> 00:36:39,358
It was a choice between dealing with that
or dealing with this football game

435
00:36:39,491 --> 00:36:42,991
and they just said it's not our function.

436
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,528
Maybe I'm naive.

437
00:36:47,082 --> 00:36:49,870
Naive? She wants to know if she's naive!

438
00:36:50,002 --> 00:36:52,707
- Oh, man. That's cold.
- I'm a cold man.

439
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:55,709
It's like you've done your duty,
served your purpose,

440
00:36:55,841 --> 00:36:59,506
so they just toss you into the heap
like a used Kleenex.

441
00:36:59,637 --> 00:37:01,676
That's the way it is. That's it.

442
00:37:01,805 --> 00:37:06,598
What is our function if it isn't to deal with
the problems you guys face every day?

443
00:37:06,727 --> 00:37:09,763
God! The smugness just...
I can't believe it.

444
00:37:09,897 --> 00:37:12,851
- Give 'em hell, Bender.
- Sorry.

445
00:37:12,983 --> 00:37:16,399
It's not gonna do any good,
but I'm rooting for you.

446
00:37:16,528 --> 00:37:19,316
Well, thanks a lot, Luke.

447
00:37:19,448 --> 00:37:22,235
Seriously, if they put
something in the paper...

448
00:37:22,368 --> 00:37:25,701
You're beautiful when you're excited.

449
00:37:28,582 --> 00:37:33,244
<i>Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit</i>

450
00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:38,090
<i>When we meet again</i>

451
00:37:38,217 --> 00:37:41,301
<i>Introduced as friends</i>

452
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:47,099
<i>Please don't let on</i>
<i>that you knew me when</i>

453
00:37:47,226 --> 00:37:52,469
<i>I was hungry and it was your worid</i>

454
00:37:52,606 --> 00:37:56,651
<i>Ah, you fake just like a woman</i>...

455
00:37:56,777 --> 00:38:01,024
God only knows
what he saw over there... or did.

456
00:38:03,325 --> 00:38:08,071
I don't understand it.
He was only in 'Nam for two weeks.

457
00:38:08,205 --> 00:38:11,241
I worry a lot about Dink too.

458
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:15,538
He's so funny, you know?
So uncomplicated.

459
00:38:15,671 --> 00:38:18,244
He's more than just a roll in the sack.

460
00:38:20,092 --> 00:38:23,176
I just hope he doesn't get totalled.

461
00:38:28,225 --> 00:38:31,559
Whoo!

462
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,439
I got it.

463
00:38:41,363 --> 00:38:44,649
- Bender!
- You got a chair!

464
00:38:44,783 --> 00:38:48,484
- You changed your hair!
- You like it?

465
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:52,155
- Yeah. It's very nice.
- You're mobile.

466
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:54,414
- I'll help you. Go ahead.
- Thanks, Luke.

467
00:38:54,543 --> 00:38:56,583
- Hi, Rick.
- Hey, Luke. How you doing?

468
00:38:56,712 --> 00:38:58,751
Congratulations.

469
00:39:11,769 --> 00:39:14,438
Would you like to come over for dinner?

470
00:39:14,563 --> 00:39:17,647
Wouldn't you like to
get out of here one night?

471
00:39:17,775 --> 00:39:19,814
I'm a good cook.

472
00:39:22,071 --> 00:39:24,110
OK?

473
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:29,570
<i>("Jumping Jack Flash"</i>
<i>by the Rolling Stones}</i>

474
00:39:38,587 --> 00:39:40,627
<i>Watch it</i>

475
00:39:45,803 --> 00:39:50,299
<i>I was born in a crossfire hurricane</i>

476
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:57,138
<i>And I howled at my ma</i>

477
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,329
I hit him after the whistle, man!

478
00:40:21,463 --> 00:40:26,421
It was wrong! He grabbed my chair!
Didn't you grab my chair?

479
00:40:39,314 --> 00:40:43,229
Can't you morons kick a field goal?
Come on! Field goal!

480
00:40:46,613 --> 00:40:50,658
B- u-s-t! Bust 'em!

481
00:41:07,551 --> 00:41:11,880
And around about July 1st,
my pa's mind would start wandering.

482
00:41:12,014 --> 00:41:17,256
He wouldn't give a damn about the cattle,
and that got us kids pretty excited.

483
00:41:17,394 --> 00:41:20,348
At the park they'd have flags flying
and games of chance,

484
00:41:20,481 --> 00:41:23,018
kissing booths and wrestling matches.

485
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:27,444
But let me tell you,
that day was always too long for me.

486
00:41:27,571 --> 00:41:31,699
When it got dark, the band
would play "The Star-Spangled Banner"

487
00:41:31,825 --> 00:41:33,865
and the fireworks would start up,

488
00:41:33,994 --> 00:41:38,490
and I'd start thinking how brave those
men were that fought in the Revolution.

489
00:41:38,624 --> 00:41:43,036
I'd dream about those men,
how they went to war for our freedom.

490
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:46,040
I guess that's when I decided
to be a soldier,

491
00:41:46,173 --> 00:41:49,423
seeing the sky lit up with those rockets.

492
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:51,591
I enlisted when I became of age.

493
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,389
I served in Europe and Worid War Two

494
00:41:54,514 --> 00:41:58,049
and was involved in the liberation
of dozens of towns.

495
00:41:58,185 --> 00:42:02,183
As I passed through them,
as I saw the faces of the people,

496
00:42:02,314 --> 00:42:05,932
I realised I had fulfilled my dream.

497
00:42:06,068 --> 00:42:11,109
I had become one of those men
who had gone to war for freedom.

498
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,157
I sure wound up doing
what I wanted to do,

499
00:42:14,284 --> 00:42:17,902
and that's what July 4th means to me.

500
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,545
- I bet you can't do that.
- I can't do that. Can you do this?

501
00:42:33,387 --> 00:42:36,174
- No.
- Go on, try it.

502
00:42:38,475 --> 00:42:40,515
I can't do it.

503
00:42:40,644 --> 00:42:45,270
Hey, Billy the Kid. Let's show
these guys what real talent is. Come on.

504
00:42:45,399 --> 00:42:49,348
Give me your arm. You know,
the duet we worked up last night.

505
00:42:53,907 --> 00:42:58,320
- Billy, you gonna play that thing?
- Come on, Billy. Play your guitar.

506
00:42:58,453 --> 00:43:01,988
Come on. I love
when you play the guitar.

507
00:43:17,014 --> 00:43:22,435
What is tomorrow? What is it we need?

508
00:43:22,561 --> 00:43:25,431
What will it give us?

509
00:43:25,564 --> 00:43:27,936
A new life we can lead

510
00:43:28,066 --> 00:43:33,690
Will the wind crack the limbs
of a few dying trees?

511
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,824
Will the branches unite
and bend in the breeze?

512
00:43:43,915 --> 00:43:48,577
Tomorrow is hope
for it is something I've not seen

513
00:43:49,713 --> 00:43:56,166
Tomorrow is a sunny day...
live in a sunny dream...

514
00:44:07,064 --> 00:44:10,148
Come on, Billy. That sounded great.

515
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,200
Shit.

516
00:44:24,539 --> 00:44:27,659
I can't play my fucking guitar.

517
00:44:44,935 --> 00:44:47,177
God!

518
00:44:53,527 --> 00:44:55,899
It's all right, man.

519
00:44:57,239 --> 00:44:59,362
It's gonna be all right.

520
00:45:02,869 --> 00:45:07,827
I think it really helped him
having you there. I really do.

521
00:45:13,171 --> 00:45:15,413
Luke, are you OK?

522
00:45:16,967 --> 00:45:21,130
- Yeah.
- Should we do the dinner another night?

523
00:45:21,263 --> 00:45:23,302
No. No.

524
00:45:50,792 --> 00:45:54,576
I think you were really wonderful
with him. I really do.

525
00:46:06,767 --> 00:46:09,720
Oh, boy.

526
00:46:09,853 --> 00:46:13,685
Just come down here
and hold the chair for me.

527
00:46:16,151 --> 00:46:18,309
Thanks.

528
00:46:28,246 --> 00:46:30,618
You could pick my ankles up.

529
00:46:39,508 --> 00:46:42,508
Thank you. That's good. Thank you.

530
00:46:44,554 --> 00:46:46,594
It's warm because I've had the oven on.

531
00:46:46,723 --> 00:46:52,477
I've got one of those timing devices
that cooks your food while you're at work.

532
00:46:52,604 --> 00:46:54,643
Whoo.

533
00:46:56,399 --> 00:46:59,733
Let me just move you around a bit.

534
00:46:59,861 --> 00:47:02,732
- You like margaritas?
- Yeah.

535
00:47:02,864 --> 00:47:05,402
Well...

536
00:47:05,534 --> 00:47:08,653
I just happen to have some.

537
00:47:12,332 --> 00:47:14,621
Let me just...

538
00:47:18,421 --> 00:47:21,173
Do you get a chance to go out very much?

539
00:47:21,299 --> 00:47:24,917
- Do you go to people's homes?
- No, I don't.

540
00:47:31,184 --> 00:47:33,556
Let's go in the living room.

541
00:47:35,564 --> 00:47:37,936
I think you can make it. OK?

542
00:47:51,746 --> 00:47:53,822
Let's see. Um...

543
00:47:56,668 --> 00:47:59,373
Wait a minute. What am I doing?

544
00:47:59,504 --> 00:48:03,003
- What?
- What am I lighting a fire for?

545
00:48:04,384 --> 00:48:06,460
It's the old Girl Scout instinct.

546
00:48:06,595 --> 00:48:08,634
Let's see. I've got a dip...

547
00:48:11,683 --> 00:48:14,470
Sit down, Bender.

548
00:48:14,603 --> 00:48:16,642
Sit down.

549
00:48:20,567 --> 00:48:23,354
- Are you nervous?
-

550
00:48:23,486 --> 00:48:25,526
Yes.

551
00:48:27,616 --> 00:48:29,655
Why are you nervous?

552
00:48:32,329 --> 00:48:35,911
This isn't "Have a Gimp Over
for Dinner" Night, is it?

553
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:38,828
You're not one of those weirdos?

554
00:48:43,214 --> 00:48:45,884
No, I'm not, Luke.

555
00:48:48,887 --> 00:48:50,926
I know you're not.

556
00:48:53,892 --> 00:48:58,055
I'm just very happy to be here.

557
00:49:04,611 --> 00:49:06,900
I'm glad you're here.

558
00:49:12,911 --> 00:49:15,069
How about some music?

559
00:49:16,498 --> 00:49:18,537
Well...

560
00:49:19,626 --> 00:49:23,955
I don't think you're gonna
like my records very much.

561
00:49:24,089 --> 00:49:26,959
You probably won't
like the way I dance either.

562
00:49:30,095 --> 00:49:33,049
Well...

563
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:39,976
Do you know that when I dream,
I'm not in the chair?

564
00:49:40,105 --> 00:49:44,268
I don't even have a chair in my dream.
I have legs.

565
00:49:47,404 --> 00:49:52,315
When I was a kid, I used to jump
in my mother's kitchen

566
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:54,988
and touch the ceiling.

567
00:49:55,120 --> 00:50:01,324
She used to get pissed off cos
I'd leave my handprints on the ceiling.

568
00:50:01,459 --> 00:50:05,327
I still check the snow reports,
the conditions at Mammoth.

569
00:50:05,463 --> 00:50:08,250
I'm still the same person, you know.

570
00:50:09,342 --> 00:50:12,711
It's funny.
When people look at me, they see...

571
00:50:12,846 --> 00:50:16,594
something else,
but they don't see who I am.

572
00:50:20,145 --> 00:50:24,605
I think people have a real hard time
seeing who other people really are.

573
00:50:24,733 --> 00:50:28,267
People don't see <i>me</i> like I really am.

574
00:50:28,403 --> 00:50:35,402
People look at me, I think, and they see
"Oh, cheery Sally, the captain's wife."

575
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:47,166
Sometimes I feel like
I'm becoming what people see.

576
00:50:48,381 --> 00:50:52,379
You know, I spend 95<i>/</i>
of my time at the hospital

577
00:50:52,510 --> 00:50:54,752
thinking about making love with you.

578
00:51:03,438 --> 00:51:06,937
I've never been unfaithful to my husband.

579
00:51:09,235 --> 00:51:16,401
<i>Do those who hear</i>
<i>think he's doing wrong?</i>

580
00:51:16,534 --> 00:51:23,153
<i>While the church bell</i>
<i>tolls its one-note song</i>

581
00:51:23,291 --> 00:51:29,910
<i>And the school bell</i>
<i>is tinkling to the throng</i>

582
00:51:31,466 --> 00:51:37,006
<i>Come here where your ears cannot hear</i>

583
00:51:38,306 --> 00:51:41,307
<i>And close your eyes, child</i>...

584
00:51:41,434 --> 00:51:45,135
- Don't wake him up.
- Hey. Doc?

585
00:51:46,314 --> 00:51:49,149
Wake up.

586
00:51:49,275 --> 00:51:52,561
We sail with the morning tide.

587
00:51:54,906 --> 00:51:58,156
- Hey, Doc. Why don't you go to bed?
- Hi, Sally.

588
00:51:58,284 --> 00:52:01,202
- Hi, Doc.
- You think you can make it, Doc?

589
00:52:01,329 --> 00:52:02,989
Sure.

590
00:52:04,999 --> 00:52:07,122
Smooth sailing, Doc.

591
00:52:09,295 --> 00:52:12,878
Hey... You want a ride?

592
00:52:13,007 --> 00:52:15,249
- Huh?
- You want a ride?

593
00:52:22,517 --> 00:52:27,558
- You sure I'm not heavy?
- I wouldn't know.

594
00:52:27,689 --> 00:52:29,183
Shh!

595
00:52:29,315 --> 00:52:34,061
- What are you doing?
- I don't know where to put my hands.

596
00:52:34,195 --> 00:52:36,354
Put them in your pockets.

597
00:52:41,578 --> 00:52:45,955
- Seems strange to be here at night.
- Not for me.

598
00:52:51,129 --> 00:52:58,045
<i>With eager tongues we taste our strife</i>

599
00:52:58,177 --> 00:53:04,263
<i>And fill our lungs with seas of life</i>...

600
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:08,889
Thank you for the... for the ride.

601
00:53:09,022 --> 00:53:11,180
Thank you for the dinner.

602
00:53:12,275 --> 00:53:17,151
<i>And close your lips, child</i>

603
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:21,574
<i>So softly I might kiss you</i>

604
00:53:21,701 --> 00:53:27,739
<i>Let your flower perfume out</i>
<i>and let the winds caress you</i>

605
00:53:28,833 --> 00:53:36,211
<i>As I walk on through the garden</i>
<i>I am hoping I don't miss you</i>

606
00:53:36,341 --> 00:53:41,583
<i>If all the things you taste</i>
<i>ain't what they seem</i>

607
00:53:42,138 --> 00:53:46,218
<i>Then don't mind me</i>...

608
00:53:46,768 --> 00:53:48,807
Good night.

609
00:53:52,106 --> 00:53:54,146
Good night.

610
00:53:56,736 --> 00:54:01,279
<i>Then close your eyes, child</i>

611
00:54:01,407 --> 00:54:05,701
<i>And look at what I'll show you</i>

612
00:54:05,828 --> 00:54:12,578
<i>Let your mind go reeling out</i>
<i>and let the breezes blow you</i>

613
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:16,328
<i>Then maybe when we meet</i>

614
00:54:16,714 --> 00:54:21,092
<i>Suddenly I will know you</i>

615
00:54:21,219 --> 00:54:26,177
<i>If all the things you see</i>
<i>ain't what they seem</i>...

616
00:54:32,772 --> 00:54:35,310
This just came.

617
00:54:39,362 --> 00:54:41,734
Do you want me to stay?

618
00:54:42,824 --> 00:54:44,863
I'll be in my office.

619
00:54:56,462 --> 00:54:58,087
Vi?

620
00:54:58,214 --> 00:55:00,670
- Vi?
- Here!

621
00:55:01,634 --> 00:55:03,674
Orders from the front.

622
00:55:03,803 --> 00:55:07,089
We ate 200 gallons
of chicken noodle soup last week.

623
00:55:07,223 --> 00:55:09,928
How do you feel about
going to Hong Kong for a week?

624
00:55:10,059 --> 00:55:13,345
- Are you kidding?
- Bob and Dink just got their R and R.

625
00:55:13,479 --> 00:55:15,519
Oh, my God! Hong Kong?

626
00:55:15,648 --> 00:55:19,480
Will you check the plane schedules?
I gotta get my hair done, go to the bank.

627
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:22,777
I think it's already tomorrow there.

628
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:27,157
- A week?
- Well, five days.

629
00:55:28,536 --> 00:55:30,908
Well, I can't go.

630
00:55:33,875 --> 00:55:39,545
What am I supposed to do? Walk out
on my job? Walk out on my brother?

631
00:55:39,672 --> 00:55:41,712
I just can't, Sally.

632
00:55:44,761 --> 00:55:48,675
Yeah. I'm gonna miss you. So is Dink.

633
00:55:49,891 --> 00:55:53,509
- I'll call you when I get back.
- Yeah.

634
00:55:53,644 --> 00:55:56,598
- Give him a kiss from me.
- Right.

635
00:55:58,191 --> 00:56:00,230
On the cheek!

636
00:56:09,952 --> 00:56:14,164
Great shot. Great shot. My best pass.

637
00:56:18,252 --> 00:56:20,494
Oh! Great shot.

638
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:23,880
Good play. You're out, you're out.

639
00:56:24,008 --> 00:56:26,760
Fucking in over your head!

640
00:56:26,886 --> 00:56:30,220
- Hey, Bender!
- No way. No way.

641
00:56:30,348 --> 00:56:32,886
Oh, that's my best shot!

642
00:56:34,227 --> 00:56:38,141
Good news.
I'm getting released on Thursday.

643
00:56:38,981 --> 00:56:41,852
- I'm getting out!
- That's great.

644
00:56:41,984 --> 00:56:44,985
- How you doing?
- Are you gonna stay with someone?

645
00:56:45,113 --> 00:56:49,821
I've got my own place.
I'm gonna have wheels. I'll be in touch.

646
00:56:49,951 --> 00:56:51,990
I owe you dinner.

647
00:56:57,375 --> 00:56:59,913
I'm not going to be around for a while.

648
00:57:00,044 --> 00:57:04,089
I just heard from Bob.
He's getting his R and R.

649
00:57:04,215 --> 00:57:07,299
I'm gonna be meeting him in Hong Kong.

650
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:14,676
- Well, have a nice trip.
- Yeah. I'll see you soon.

651
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,521
The iceman returns. Shoot it up.

652
00:57:20,648 --> 00:57:22,688
Luke!

653
00:57:26,863 --> 00:57:32,023
- Whoa. Look at that. Great shot.
- Come on. Put it in the hole.

654
00:58:17,914 --> 00:58:20,487
Over here. Over here.

655
00:58:20,625 --> 00:58:23,329
There you go. Over this way.

656
00:58:29,383 --> 00:58:34,129
Let's go. Move it up. Put it down, man.
Down, down.

657
00:58:35,723 --> 00:58:41,761
How you doing, Sally?
Hey, Vi. Where is she?

658
00:58:55,409 --> 00:58:59,241
Why did you have to go to work
in the hospital?

659
00:59:01,749 --> 00:59:05,248
- Because I wanted to.
- But it's the pits!

660
00:59:06,629 --> 00:59:08,918
You didn't have to do that.

661
00:59:13,177 --> 00:59:15,929
I just don't want you to work.

662
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:34,780
I love my mama and my papa too

663
00:59:36,409 --> 00:59:39,908
I love my mama...

664
00:59:40,037 --> 00:59:43,453
I just don't understand it.
Five days. That's all I wanted.

665
00:59:43,582 --> 00:59:48,825
Is that too much to expect from somebody
you've been with for two years?

666
00:59:48,963 --> 00:59:55,167
Like... women and dogs, you've got to
have a licence to show you're the owner.

667
00:59:56,262 --> 01:00:02,881
Yeah. Thanks very much for all the advice.
I really appreciate it.

668
01:00:03,019 --> 01:00:06,553
Tell the head honcho
I'm going to the place across the street.

669
01:00:06,689 --> 01:00:08,847
- I'll see him later.
- I'm sorry.

670
01:00:08,983 --> 01:00:13,277
Oh, no. Thanks for everything. Excuse me.

671
01:00:13,404 --> 01:00:18,399
If you see Vi, thank her for me too.
Make sure of that, huh?

672
01:00:28,711 --> 01:00:32,874
What the fuck is the matter with him?
Where's he going?

673
01:00:33,007 --> 01:00:35,877
He's upset because Vi didn't come.

674
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:40,755
And because I suggested he didn't
have the right to order her over here.

675
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:45,848
- We gotta go get him.
- No, let's just be alone for a few minutes.

676
01:00:48,397 --> 01:00:50,437
We <i>are</i> alone.

677
01:00:51,567 --> 01:00:56,988
- There's something wrong.
- It's not you. It's just... fucked up.

678
01:00:57,114 --> 01:00:59,784
All this bullshit about 'Nam.
It's in my head.

679
01:00:59,909 --> 01:01:02,945
Talk to me about it.
I want to know what it's like.

680
01:01:03,079 --> 01:01:07,326
I don't know what it's like.
I only know what it is.

681
01:01:07,458 --> 01:01:09,830
The TV shows what it's like.

682
01:01:14,173 --> 01:01:17,756
It sure as hell don't show what it is.

683
01:01:30,481 --> 01:01:32,520
I gotta find him.

684
01:01:41,575 --> 01:01:44,113
Does she love me, Raul?

685
01:01:47,873 --> 01:01:50,245
- She loves me, man.
- I wouldn't let you down.

686
01:01:50,376 --> 01:01:54,290
- Those new heads'll work real good.
- I appreciate it. Have a good day.

687
01:01:54,422 --> 01:01:57,458
- Take her easy.
- All right, man.

688
01:02:14,984 --> 01:02:19,313
- How are my plants?
- They're fine. Nah, they died.

689
01:02:20,614 --> 01:02:23,734
- They died?
- Yeah. Sorry.

690
01:02:23,868 --> 01:02:25,907
What?

691
01:02:26,036 --> 01:02:29,619
- They died.
- Hey, man, I only got two plants.

692
01:02:30,791 --> 01:02:34,492
- What about that Kennedy assassination?
- What do <i>you</i> think about it?

693
01:02:36,422 --> 01:02:40,669
Hey, Sally, listen. I've made up my mind.

694
01:02:40,801 --> 01:02:43,886
You can tell the kid
I'll marry her if you want to.

695
01:02:44,013 --> 01:02:46,468
<i>You</i> tell her!

696
01:02:46,599 --> 01:02:50,181
Give me a break. I'm serious about this.

697
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:58,518
I've put it down all in writing and
I wanted you to kinda talk to her about it.

698
01:02:58,652 --> 01:03:04,904
- OK. OK, of course. I'd be glad to.
- OK!

699
01:03:05,034 --> 01:03:07,821
Would you have married me
if I wasn't a Marine?

700
01:03:07,953 --> 01:03:12,247
- In a second.
- What did I tell you?

701
01:03:12,374 --> 01:03:16,289
Didn't I tell you the uniform
always used to mean something?

702
01:03:18,964 --> 01:03:23,626
The entire structure
of the Marine Corps is changing.

703
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:28,587
It used to really mean something
to be a Marine.

704
01:03:28,724 --> 01:03:32,722
We're no longer the elite.
We're not even equal.

705
01:03:35,064 --> 01:03:39,275
<i>Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday</i>

706
01:03:39,401 --> 01:03:43,648
<i>Who could hang a name on you?</i>

707
01:03:43,781 --> 01:03:45,820
Excuse me.

708
01:03:48,410 --> 01:03:50,866

710
01:03:59,296 --> 01:04:02,001

<i>Lose your dreams</i>

714
01:04:20,192 --> 01:04:22,232
Big hook.

715
01:04:25,864 --> 01:04:28,569
Hey, mister, can you walk?

716
01:04:28,701 --> 01:04:32,615
No, I can't walk.
That's why I'm in this chair.

717
01:04:34,498 --> 01:04:37,452
- What happened to you?
- Yeah. What happened?

718
01:04:37,585 --> 01:04:39,826
I got in an accident. I had a bad accident.

719
01:04:39,962 --> 01:04:43,247
I got a piece of metal in my back,
and after that I couldn't walk.

720
01:04:43,382 --> 01:04:46,833
- Mary, I'm gonna go around.
- I don't believe you.

721
01:04:46,969 --> 01:04:50,219
- What's the matter with kids today?
- We don't believe you.

722
01:04:50,347 --> 01:04:54,594
- What's the matter with you characters?
- I want a ride! I want a ride!

723
01:04:54,727 --> 01:04:59,554
OK. Come on. I'll give you a ride.
Here we go. Oops!

724
01:04:59,690 --> 01:05:04,435
Are you gonna help me out here?
Pull that back. That's it. That's good.

725
01:05:04,570 --> 01:05:08,947
It's all right, we got it. I'll show you
a way out if you don't want to pay.

726
01:05:13,871 --> 01:05:16,955
First week in combat... Huh!

727
01:05:18,751 --> 01:05:21,324
We took this little hamlet.

728
01:05:24,173 --> 01:05:31,006
I got this second lieutenant -
this fucking Camp Lejeune whizz kid.

729
01:05:33,015 --> 01:05:38,306
He comes whipping right up to me.
"Excuse me, sir. Sorry to bother you."

730
01:05:38,437 --> 01:05:41,640
"Do you think it'd be OK
if we put the heads on the poles?"

731
01:05:41,774 --> 01:05:45,474
"That really scares the shit out of the VC."

732
01:06:01,377 --> 01:06:03,416
My men...

733
01:06:05,005 --> 01:06:07,377
were chopping heads off.

734
01:06:11,970 --> 01:06:14,343
That's what they were into.

735
01:06:22,147 --> 01:06:24,187
Oh, they were dead.

736
01:06:28,237 --> 01:06:31,855
<i>Please allow me to introduce myself</i>

737
01:06:31,990 --> 01:06:36,652

739
01:06:40,374 --> 01:06:44,668
<i>Stolen many a man's soul and faith</i>

740
01:06:44,795 --> 01:06:48,709
<i>I was around when Jesus Christ</i>...

741
01:06:49,383 --> 01:06:54,543
Do you like Tiger balm?
Makes you feel real cool.

742
01:06:57,641 --> 01:07:00,013
Let me put some on your back.

743
01:07:08,235 --> 01:07:13,395
Is that the way you massage
the basket cases at the hospital?

744
01:07:20,706 --> 01:07:23,493
<i>I stuck around St Petersburg</i>

751
01:07:49,109 --> 01:07:51,149
Hi.

752
01:07:53,655 --> 01:07:57,071
- Where's Adrienne?
- Couldn't make it.

753
01:07:57,201 --> 01:08:00,118
She asked me to take her place.

754
01:08:00,245 --> 01:08:02,997
I was kind of counting on Adrienne.

755
01:08:04,291 --> 01:08:07,992
I've been around
this part of the pool before.

756
01:08:08,128 --> 01:08:12,874
- With a gimp?
- Yeah. A guy in Reno.

757
01:08:16,011 --> 01:08:18,680
- Do you want a drink?
- I'd love a drink.

758
01:08:18,806 --> 01:08:21,379
Well, there aren't many days

759
01:08:21,517 --> 01:08:23,640
And not enough time

760
01:08:28,565 --> 01:08:30,641
Bedlam is silent

761
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:37,523
And the stillness is fury

762
01:08:41,203 --> 01:08:42,199
Luke?

763
01:08:45,165 --> 01:08:47,537
Put him on the phone. I'll talk to him.

764
01:08:47,668 --> 01:08:50,075
- Luke?
- Yeah.

765
01:08:50,212 --> 01:08:53,379
Hey, Luke. Hey, man, listen to this.

766
01:08:54,508 --> 01:08:57,343
When I opened my eyes

767
01:08:57,469 --> 01:08:59,841
A few were gone

768
01:09:08,397 --> 01:09:12,015
- If I have to go, is this gonna be OK?
- Sure.

769
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:19,400
I've got too many days to do it
and not enough time

770
01:09:22,244 --> 01:09:24,283
Fucking shit.

771
01:09:32,045 --> 01:09:35,580
- Can I use your phone to call my service?
- Sure. Do what you want.

772
01:09:35,716 --> 01:09:39,215
Just close the door when you leave, OK?

773
01:09:39,344 --> 01:09:42,014
It's not your fault. You're a pretty lady.

774
01:09:45,017 --> 01:09:47,056
Fuck off, man!

775
01:10:03,952 --> 01:10:06,739
Hey, Munson. Open the door, man.

776
01:10:19,426 --> 01:10:22,712
- Open up!
- Unlock the door, Munson. Let's go.

777
01:10:22,846 --> 01:10:25,551
- Hey, Munson.
- Come on, man.

778
01:10:36,735 --> 01:10:39,273
Come on, open up the door, man.

779
01:10:41,198 --> 01:10:43,237
Come on.

780
01:10:56,296 --> 01:10:58,419
What the fuck is going on here?

781
01:11:34,292 --> 01:11:37,496
- He went out, man.
- The man went out.

782
01:11:37,629 --> 01:11:40,832
Son of a bitch. The man went out.

783
01:11:40,966 --> 01:11:43,338
Make a hole. Make a hole.

784
01:11:51,476 --> 01:11:53,516
Did he do himself in?

785
01:11:56,148 --> 01:11:57,772
What's happening, man?

786
01:11:57,899 --> 01:12:02,692
Some kid just bought it
by shooting air into his veins.

787
01:12:06,783 --> 01:12:09,903
Out of here! Out of here! Out! It's all right.

788
01:12:13,248 --> 01:12:18,206
- Did you see something there?
- Get away. I wanna find out.

789
01:12:22,758 --> 01:12:25,462
Aw, shit. He's dead, man.

790
01:12:42,694 --> 01:12:44,272
Vi!

791
01:12:48,075 --> 01:12:50,114
Vi!

792
01:12:56,625 --> 01:12:59,294
He didn't even fucking call me.

793
01:13:01,713 --> 01:13:04,916
Little bastard just wasted his life.

794
01:13:07,594 --> 01:13:10,429
Well, it's a big fucking relief.

795
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:16,008
Man, this nurse calls me
and says he's dead.

796
01:13:16,144 --> 01:13:18,220
I don't even know her.

797
01:13:20,482 --> 01:13:23,483
I just gotta get out of here. Let's go out.

798
01:13:23,610 --> 01:13:27,026
- Just wait a second. I gotta take a shower.
- Yeah. Me too.

799
01:13:27,155 --> 01:13:30,655
Have some wine or something.
I'll be right back, OK?

800
01:13:33,703 --> 01:13:37,119
- Don't go away.
- I won't.

801
01:14:01,565 --> 01:14:04,768
<i>Get your motor running</i>

802
01:14:04,901 --> 01:14:08,021
<i>Head out on the highway</i>

803
01:14:08,155 --> 01:14:10,906
<i>Looking for adventure</i>

804
01:14:11,032 --> 01:14:14,947
<i>And whatever comes our way</i>

805
01:14:15,078 --> 01:14:18,281
<i>Yeah, darlin', gonna make it happen</i>

806
01:14:18,415 --> 01:14:21,581
<i>Take the worid in a love embrace</i>

807
01:14:21,710 --> 01:14:23,998
<i>Fire all of your guns at once</i>

808
01:14:24,129 --> 01:14:27,961
<i>And explode into space</i>

809
01:14:28,091 --> 01:14:31,175
<i>I like smoke and lightning</i>

810
01:14:31,303 --> 01:14:34,588
<i>Heavy metal thunder</i>

811
01:14:34,723 --> 01:14:37,392
<i>Racing with the wind</i>

812
01:14:37,517 --> 01:14:40,684
<i>And the feeling that I'm under</i>...

813
01:14:41,646 --> 01:14:45,478
- What do you think I should do, Sally?
- Huh?

814
01:14:48,361 --> 01:14:50,852
I think I'm gonna say yes.

815
01:14:52,616 --> 01:14:54,655
To Dink?

816
01:14:54,784 --> 01:14:57,702
Hey, congratulations, Mrs Mobley!

817
01:15:00,707 --> 01:15:02,747
<i>We can climb so high</i>

818
01:15:02,876 --> 01:15:07,752
<i>I never wanna die</i>

819
01:15:07,881 --> 01:15:11,581
<i>Born to be wild</i>

820
01:15:14,971 --> 01:15:18,387
<i>Born to be wild</i>...

821
01:15:28,526 --> 01:15:31,527
- Here you go, ladies.
- Did you order some more?

822
01:15:31,655 --> 01:15:35,948
- We didn't order more champagne.
- Those gentlemen over there did.

823
01:15:43,625 --> 01:15:47,457
- You're not calling them over?
- They want us to come over.

824
01:15:47,587 --> 01:15:51,003
I'll take care of this. You get your stuff.

825
01:16:03,186 --> 01:16:05,642
- Hey!
- We're the boys from number nine.

826
01:16:07,315 --> 01:16:09,355
<i>I know what I want</i>

827
01:16:09,484 --> 01:16:14,941
<i>But I just don't know</i>
<i>how to go about getting it</i>

828
01:16:16,241 --> 01:16:18,280
<i>Feeling, sweet feeling</i>

829
01:16:18,410 --> 01:16:22,324
<i>Drops from my fingers, fingers</i>

830
01:16:23,415 --> 01:16:27,911
<i>Manic depressión is catching my soul</i>

831
01:16:29,212 --> 01:16:31,252
<i>Yeah</i>

832
01:16:34,092 --> 01:16:38,884
<i>Woman so weary,</i>
<i>the sweet cause in vain</i>...

833
01:16:58,074 --> 01:17:02,452
<i>Manic depressión is a frustrating mess</i>

834
01:17:49,376 --> 01:17:55,212
<i>Well, I think I'll go turn myself off</i>
<i>and go on down</i>...

835
01:17:56,174 --> 01:18:00,503
What in the fuck are you doing?!

836
01:18:00,637 --> 01:18:03,306
- Oh, shit.
- I'm so happy!

837
01:18:03,431 --> 01:18:05,471
Oops.

838
01:18:08,019 --> 01:18:13,476
- Are we here?
- This is your honeymoon cottage.

839
01:18:13,608 --> 01:18:16,099
Ta-da!

840
01:18:22,450 --> 01:18:28,370
Hey, Sal. Take off your coat.
You're such a good horse.

841
01:18:28,498 --> 01:18:32,709
- What the hell's the matter with you?
- You're on a military base.

842
01:18:32,836 --> 01:18:36,169
- Who do you think you are?
-

843
01:18:36,297 --> 01:18:41,209
-
- What's this all about?

844
01:18:41,344 --> 01:18:44,179
This guy seems to be tied up to the fence.

845
01:18:44,305 --> 01:18:47,223
Mister, I don't know
what your beef is, and I don't care,

846
01:18:47,350 --> 01:18:50,304
but I want you to get this chain
off the fence now.

847
01:18:50,437 --> 01:18:53,188
Pay attention, motherfucker!

848
01:18:53,314 --> 01:18:56,399
- We need some entertainment.
- The lady wants some music.

849
01:18:56,526 --> 01:19:01,022
We need some entertainment.
Sally, come on!

850
01:19:05,326 --> 01:19:07,652
Yes. Got it!

851
01:19:10,498 --> 01:19:12,538
Appropriate music.

852
01:19:14,419 --> 01:19:17,788
Very entertaining.
You guys ever been to a go-go club?

853
01:19:17,922 --> 01:19:21,422
- Tonight.
- No. That was not a go-go club.

854
01:19:21,551 --> 01:19:25,335
- What does a real go-go look like?
- I'm gonna show you.

855
01:19:25,472 --> 01:19:27,511
Show us!

856
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:29,680
It's high up here.

857
01:19:33,521 --> 01:19:35,561
My!

858
01:19:39,777 --> 01:19:42,351
My! Whoo!

859
01:19:47,619 --> 01:19:50,489
She's very good. What does she do?

860
01:19:50,622 --> 01:19:54,038
She's a nutritionist at the VA hospital.

861
01:19:56,127 --> 01:19:57,752
Ooh.

862
01:19:57,879 --> 01:20:00,880
I think I see some flesh.

863
01:20:01,424 --> 01:20:04,793
Take it easy now. Bruce is here.

864
01:20:17,482 --> 01:20:20,317
Easy does it, Vi. Easy.

865
01:20:21,402 --> 01:20:23,442
Take it easy.

866
01:20:27,242 --> 01:20:29,448
You don't have to do that.

867
01:20:36,125 --> 01:20:38,165
Billy!

868
01:20:39,587 --> 01:20:44,415
My brother. My brother!

869
01:20:46,970 --> 01:20:49,342
What happened? What's wrong?

870
01:20:49,472 --> 01:20:51,714
I think she freaked out.

871
01:20:53,226 --> 01:20:56,595
Maybe we should have turned on the TV.

872
01:20:56,980 --> 01:20:59,103
<i>He identified himself as Luke Martin</i>.

873
01:20:59,232 --> 01:21:02,683
<i>He said he was a sergeant</i>
<i>in the Marines in Vietnam</i>.

874
01:21:02,819 --> 01:21:06,188
<i>He was arrested after</i>
<i>he chained himself to the west gate</i>.

875
01:21:06,322 --> 01:21:09,857
<i>He said he wants to stop any others</i>
<i>from going to Vietnam</i>.

876
01:21:09,993 --> 01:21:14,987
<i>The reason I'm here is because</i>
<i>a buddy of mine who'd been in 'Nam</i>

877
01:21:15,123 --> 01:21:17,162
<i>took his own life today</i>.

878
01:21:17,292 --> 01:21:20,043
- <i>This is kind of a funeral service</i>.
- It's Luke!

879
01:21:20,169 --> 01:21:22,791
<i>I'm here because I'm trying</i>
<i>to tell people, man,</i>

880
01:21:22,922 --> 01:21:26,872
<i>if we want to commit suicide, we have</i>
<i>plenty of reasons to do it at home</i>.

881
01:21:27,010 --> 01:21:30,544
<i>We don't have to go to Vietnam</i>
<i>to find reasons to kill ourselves</i>.

882
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:37,217
- <i>I just don't think we should be there</i>.
- <i>Do you think this is a way to stop it?</i>

883
01:21:37,353 --> 01:21:39,429
<i>I don't know, man</i>.

884
01:21:39,564 --> 01:21:43,063
<i>The police had difficulty</i>
<i>getting Sgt Martin into the police car</i>

885
01:21:43,192 --> 01:21:47,689
<i>because he also was chained</i>
<i>to his wheelchair</i>.

886
01:21:59,667 --> 01:22:01,707
Let me take you home.

887
01:22:26,903 --> 01:22:29,690
I'm not a very nice person.

888
01:22:36,913 --> 01:22:38,989
You are to me.

889
01:22:51,552 --> 01:22:54,921
I wanna spend the night with you.

890
01:23:13,366 --> 01:23:16,035
- Where's your car?
- Right here.

891
01:23:37,098 --> 01:23:39,137
Yeah, they're out of the car.

892
01:23:39,267 --> 01:23:44,641
- Goddamn thing's got a curtain.
- Coming round the side.

893
01:23:45,982 --> 01:23:48,354
Up to the walk.

894
01:23:49,527 --> 01:23:53,145
Is she pushing him
or is he going under his own power?

895
01:23:53,281 --> 01:23:55,320
She's pushing.

896
01:24:33,154 --> 01:24:38,990
Make yourself comfortable.
I have some things to do in the bathroom.

897
01:24:40,077 --> 01:24:44,823
- I should be just a few minutes.
- OK.

898
01:25:20,326 --> 01:25:24,822
Will you pull that sheepskin
toward the centre?

899
01:25:28,251 --> 01:25:31,370
Pillow. Pillow up against the back.

900
01:25:35,174 --> 01:25:37,214
Like that?

901
01:26:13,462 --> 01:26:16,914
Turn the light on. I want to see you.

902
01:26:28,477 --> 01:26:30,933
What do I do?

903
01:26:31,063 --> 01:26:35,275
Everything. I want you to do everything.

904
01:26:35,401 --> 01:26:39,481
Where can I touch you?
Where can you... Where can you feel?

905
01:26:39,614 --> 01:26:44,774
That's nice. I'm real sensitive,
all the areas that I feel.

906
01:26:44,911 --> 01:26:47,152
I'm real sensitive there.

907
01:26:52,752 --> 01:26:57,710
- Can you feel that at all?
- I can't feel it, but I can see it.

908
01:27:06,515 --> 01:27:10,762
- I wish you could feel me.
- I feel you.

909
01:27:13,981 --> 01:27:16,021
I want you.

910
01:27:45,554 --> 01:27:47,594
Oh! Softly.

911
01:28:10,746 --> 01:28:12,786
Oh!

912
01:28:32,309 --> 01:28:34,765
You're so beautiful.

913
01:28:38,024 --> 01:28:41,227
Oh... oh... oh...

914
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:43,400
Hey.

915
01:28:43,529 --> 01:28:45,569
Hey. Shh.

916
01:28:59,211 --> 01:29:02,082
That's never happened to me before.

917
01:29:16,103 --> 01:29:19,804
- How much am I paying you?
-

918
01:29:27,531 --> 01:29:29,571
We gonna paint this?

919
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:32,867
We'll paint it to look like steps
so no one knows I'm here.

920
01:29:32,995 --> 01:29:35,035
Are you ready?

921
01:29:38,667 --> 01:29:40,909
- OK!
- Yay!

922
01:29:41,045 --> 01:29:45,873
<i>Living is easy with eyes closed</i>

923
01:29:46,592 --> 01:29:50,542
<i>Misunderstanding all you see</i>

924
01:29:51,847 --> 01:29:57,008
<i>It's getting hard to be someone</i>
<i>but it all works out</i>

925
01:29:57,144 --> 01:30:00,644
<i>It doesn't matter much to me</i>...

926
01:30:01,232 --> 01:30:04,731
Well, this, strangely enough, is our barber.

927
01:30:04,860 --> 01:30:08,728
For 25 cents you get a massage,
your hair cut and your ears popped.

928
01:30:08,864 --> 01:30:12,399
Impressive, huh?
The water buffalo didn't like us either.

929
01:30:12,535 --> 01:30:14,574
There's a tunnel. Look.

930
01:30:14,703 --> 01:30:19,615
They'd been working on them since Worid
War Two when they fought the Japanese.

931
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:24,661
Then they fought the French
and built more tunnels and now they got...

932
01:30:24,797 --> 01:30:30,467
That's a buddy of mine. Willy.
He... he didn't make it.

933
01:30:31,929 --> 01:30:34,171
Pretty people, huh?

934
01:30:34,306 --> 01:30:36,382
- That's my smile.
-

935
01:30:38,269 --> 01:30:43,263
<i>That is, you can't, you know, tune in</i>
<i>but it's all right</i>

936
01:30:43,399 --> 01:30:47,147
<i>That is, I think it's not too bad</i>

937
01:30:48,696 --> 01:30:56,241
<i>Let me take you down</i>
<i>cos I'm going to Strawberry Fields</i>...

938
01:30:56,662 --> 01:31:00,991
- Oh, my God.
- I got a letter from Kathy.

939
01:31:03,252 --> 01:31:06,039
Something about the newspaper.

940
01:31:06,172 --> 01:31:09,457
<i>Strawberry Fields forever</i>

941
01:31:10,759 --> 01:31:14,508
<i>Strawberry Fields forever</i>

942
01:31:14,638 --> 01:31:17,888
<i>Strawberry Fields forever</i>

943
01:31:27,234 --> 01:31:29,642
That letter was from Bob.

944
01:31:34,450 --> 01:31:36,905
- How is he?
- I don't know. I didn't...

945
01:31:37,036 --> 01:31:41,080
I didn't get a chance to read it.
I guess he's OK.

946
01:31:44,168 --> 01:31:46,457
Well, whatever he says...

947
01:31:48,714 --> 01:31:53,542
it's a hundred times worse
than what he can tell you.

948
01:31:53,677 --> 01:31:55,717
I'm so perverse.

949
01:31:57,097 --> 01:32:03,717
I'm just jealous because I know when
it's over, he's gonna come back to you.

950
01:32:31,465 --> 01:32:35,083
We never manage to talk about Bob,
do we?

951
01:32:35,219 --> 01:32:37,258
No, we don't.

952
01:32:46,772 --> 01:32:51,517
I don't know what's gonna happen...
with Bob and me, Luke.

953
01:32:57,616 --> 01:33:03,203
It's very scary for me... to think that
maybe it's not gonna work out with him.

954
01:33:03,330 --> 01:33:05,370
I know.

955
01:33:07,209 --> 01:33:10,708
Because we've been together for so long.

956
01:33:19,888 --> 01:33:22,095
It's gonna be very hard for him,

957
01:33:22,224 --> 01:33:27,301
and he's not gonna like the fact
that I've... I've changed.

958
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:31,728
And I <i>have</i> changed.

959
01:33:35,070 --> 01:33:38,985
You know that I've never
been on my own before?

960
01:33:47,333 --> 01:33:54,463
<i>Well, baby, when times are bad</i>

961
01:33:54,590 --> 01:33:59,335
<i>Call on me, darling,</i>
<i>and I'll come to you</i>...

962
01:34:01,513 --> 01:34:05,593
- You like that, Sid?
- She's got a nice ass for a white girl.

963
01:34:05,726 --> 01:34:08,810
Should have heard some of the tapes
we made at their pad.

964
01:34:08,937 --> 01:34:12,852
- Did they get it on?
- I'll give 'em credit for that.

965
01:34:13,942 --> 01:34:16,612
- Got a good angle?
- Yeah.

966
01:34:16,737 --> 01:34:21,315
<i>A man and a woman</i>
<i>have each other, baby</i>

968
01:34:31,460 --> 01:34:36,620
<i>I need you, darling,</i>
<i>like the fish needs the sea</i>...

969
01:34:36,757 --> 01:34:40,885
Cos everybody's different.
Don't you think so?

970
01:34:41,011 --> 01:34:45,922
- Oh!
- Hey. It's cool. It's all right.

971
01:34:46,058 --> 01:34:48,097
Have a nice time.

972
01:34:48,936 --> 01:34:51,391
Two, please.

973
01:34:52,398 --> 01:34:56,810
If Dink saw you, he'd probably
think you were a hippie faggot.

974
01:34:56,944 --> 01:35:00,277
- Here's to Dink, Vi.
- A toast to the host.

975
01:35:00,406 --> 01:35:04,106
Not here... for a beer.

976
01:35:05,619 --> 01:35:10,281
If that motherfucker sends me an ear...
Are you listening?

977
01:35:10,416 --> 01:35:15,208
Are you listening? I just made a poem
and you're not even listening.

978
01:35:15,337 --> 01:35:18,836
<i>A man and woman</i>

<i>To find their way in this worid</i>...

980
01:35:29,309 --> 01:35:32,513
Bye, guys. See you tomorrow. Bye, Rita.

981
01:35:41,447 --> 01:35:43,486
Hi.

982
01:35:45,576 --> 01:35:48,826
It's from Bob. I opened it.

983
01:35:48,954 --> 01:35:51,527
He's coming home.

984
01:35:51,665 --> 01:35:54,701
- Is he all right?
- Oh, yeah. He's all right.

985
01:35:54,835 --> 01:36:00,541
He just got shot in the leg.
Nothing really too heavy. He's all right.

986
01:36:14,938 --> 01:36:17,394
Will you always be my friend?

987
01:36:21,904 --> 01:36:23,943
Yes.

988
01:36:25,073 --> 01:36:27,113
Say "always".

989
01:36:28,202 --> 01:36:31,701
Always. I'll always be your friend.

990
01:36:34,041 --> 01:36:36,080
That's very good.

991
01:36:43,634 --> 01:36:46,041
I'm gonna miss you.

992
01:37:08,075 --> 01:37:12,155
<i>There's something happening here</i>

993
01:37:12,287 --> 01:37:15,988
<i>But what it is ain't exactly clear</i>

994
01:37:17,501 --> 01:37:22,329
<i>There's a man with a gun over there</i>...

995
01:37:29,763 --> 01:37:31,803
Hello.

996
01:37:33,559 --> 01:37:35,717
Hold on a second, will you?

997
01:37:43,277 --> 01:37:46,064
Yeah. This is he.

998
01:37:50,492 --> 01:37:55,652
Hey, what I have to say to
high-school kids, they're not ready for.

999
01:37:58,166 --> 01:38:03,125
Yeah. Well, that was televisión.
I was angry. I was upset.

1000
01:38:14,641 --> 01:38:17,476
<i>What a field day for the heat</i>

1001
01:38:18,937 --> 01:38:23,267
<i>A thousand people in the street</i>

1002
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:28,395
<i>Singing songs and carrying signs</i>

1003
01:38:28,530 --> 01:38:32,943
<i>Mostly say: Hooray for our side</i>

1004
01:38:33,076 --> 01:38:36,492
<i>It's time we stop,</i>
<i>hey, what's that sound?</i>

1005
01:38:36,622 --> 01:38:40,240
<i>Everybody look what's going down</i>

1006
01:38:49,301 --> 01:38:52,752
<i>Paranoia strikes deep</i>

1007
01:38:54,181 --> 01:38:57,763
<i>Into your lives it will creep</i>

1008
01:38:58,852 --> 01:39:02,636
<i>It starts when you're always afraid</i>

1009
01:39:03,607 --> 01:39:08,767
<i>You step out of line,</i>
<i>the man come take you away</i>

1010
01:39:08,904 --> 01:39:11,573
<i>We better stop,</i>
<i>hey, what's that sound?</i>

1011
01:39:11,698 --> 01:39:13,738
<i>Everybody look what's going down</i>

1012
01:39:13,867 --> 01:39:16,821
<i>We better stop,</i>
<i>hey, what's that sound</i>...

1013
01:39:18,246 --> 01:39:21,331
What the hell did you do to your hair?

1014
01:39:22,584 --> 01:39:25,122
I've stopped straightening it.

1015
01:39:26,088 --> 01:39:28,127
Where's all the demonstrators?

1016
01:39:28,256 --> 01:39:32,385
Some asshole on the plane said there'd be
a bunch of flower-heads out here.

1017
01:39:32,511 --> 01:39:37,422
There are some kids out there
but they can't come on the base.

1018
01:39:37,557 --> 01:39:40,262
- Does your leg hurt?
- No.

1019
01:39:43,647 --> 01:39:45,723
- What do you think?
- About what?

1020
01:39:45,857 --> 01:39:47,897
Our new car.

1021
01:39:49,277 --> 01:39:51,317
The Speedster?

1022
01:39:53,448 --> 01:39:57,742
It's outstanding. Absolutely outstanding.

1023
01:39:57,869 --> 01:39:59,909
I'm glad you're back.

1024
01:40:02,374 --> 01:40:06,206
One, two, three, four!
We don't want your rotten war!

1025
01:40:06,336 --> 01:40:10,085
One, two, three, four!
We don't want your rotten war!

1026
01:40:11,675 --> 01:40:15,589
- Peace, brother.
- Peace on you too, brother.

1027
01:40:17,931 --> 01:40:21,632
One, two, three, four!
We don't want your rotten war!

1028
01:40:21,893 --> 01:40:24,930
One, two, three, four!
We don't want your rotten...

1029
01:40:26,857 --> 01:40:30,475
You never told me
that you were this close to the beach.

1030
01:40:30,610 --> 01:40:35,652
- I wanted to surprise you.
- You're full of surprises.

1031
01:40:38,368 --> 01:40:42,282
Hey! Welcome back, hero.

1032
01:40:43,248 --> 01:40:45,821
- Vi. How are you?
- Great.

1033
01:40:48,628 --> 01:40:52,128
- So tell me, how's Dink?
- Dink is fine.

1034
01:40:52,257 --> 01:40:56,718
- He's kicking everybody's ass, as always.
- Great.

1035
01:40:58,513 --> 01:41:02,381
No, ladies first,
but I'll have the number two one.

1036
01:41:02,517 --> 01:41:06,597
- Oh, my God. Does this look good.
- Cheers.

1037
01:41:06,730 --> 01:41:08,769
Are you hungry?

1038
01:41:08,899 --> 01:41:13,726
I made some Swedish meatballs
to nibble on. They go great with drinks.

1039
01:41:17,574 --> 01:41:19,614
Do you like it?

1040
01:41:21,828 --> 01:41:23,868
- How's the surf?
- It's good.

1041
01:41:23,997 --> 01:41:26,453
Why don't you sit down, sweetheart?

1042
01:41:26,583 --> 01:41:29,156
So, Bob, tell us about your foot.

1043
01:41:29,294 --> 01:41:32,877
It's not my foot, it's my leg,
and it's a goddamn bore.

1044
01:41:33,006 --> 01:41:36,790
Just like this whole fucking war is boring.

1045
01:41:36,927 --> 01:41:38,966
But, ladies...

1046
01:41:40,764 --> 01:41:44,263
old Bob has gotta tell you
one thing that is not boring,

1047
01:41:44,392 --> 01:41:49,101
and that is the good old US of A martini.

1048
01:41:49,231 --> 01:41:54,308
Of which I am going to partake
as much as I can as quick as I can.

1049
01:41:54,444 --> 01:41:56,769
Drink it up. I made gallons.

1050
01:41:57,864 --> 01:42:00,782
So come on, Bob.
Tell us the story about your leg.

1051
01:42:00,909 --> 01:42:03,482
- What happened?
- There's nothing to tell.

1052
01:42:03,620 --> 01:42:07,700
I'm a fucking hero, I'm getting a medal,
and that's the story of my leg!

1053
01:42:07,833 --> 01:42:10,620
- Nothing to it, is there?
- Great.

1054
01:42:10,752 --> 01:42:14,501
- It ain't great.
- How did it happen?

1055
01:42:17,425 --> 01:42:23,131
It's just a boring story. I'm on my way
to the showers. Got an M-16 in one hand...

1056
01:42:23,265 --> 01:42:27,594
- On your way to the showers?
- Yeah. Why not?

1057
01:42:27,727 --> 01:42:32,685
Everywhere you go you carry your M-16,
particularly when you go to the showers!

1058
01:42:32,816 --> 01:42:37,478
There I am, like every other asshole,
trucking on down the road to the showers

1059
01:42:37,612 --> 01:42:43,947
and I tripped
and shot myself right in the calf.

1060
01:42:44,077 --> 01:42:46,615
- Oh, my God.
- And that's it.

1061
01:42:46,746 --> 01:42:50,198
- Dink should've thought of that.
- I didn't think of that!

1062
01:42:50,333 --> 01:42:54,331
- It was a goddamn accident!
- Bob, you don't have to get mad.

1063
01:42:54,462 --> 01:42:59,919
- Yeah, but it was an accident.
- Why are they decorating you?

1064
01:43:01,011 --> 01:43:03,928
- Where's the head?
- Right there.

1065
01:43:07,267 --> 01:43:11,478
I promised a guy from 'Nam I'd have
a drink with him at the Officers Club

1066
01:43:11,605 --> 01:43:13,644
and I gotta go.

1067
01:43:15,025 --> 01:43:17,101
I'll be back for dinner.

1068
01:43:29,039 --> 01:43:31,162
-
- Goddamn!

1069
01:43:31,291 --> 01:43:35,620
You could've aimed better
if you'd had your lights on.

1070
01:43:37,923 --> 01:43:42,252
Man, if you keep your lights on,
you wouldn't need things like that.

1071
01:43:42,385 --> 01:43:46,383
Looks like a fucking
smithereen job to me.

1072
01:43:46,514 --> 01:43:48,673
Yeah, like fucking...

1073
01:43:48,808 --> 01:43:52,224
Not in the front
of the boats. You know?

1074
01:43:52,354 --> 01:43:54,145
The SSS...

1075
01:43:54,272 --> 01:43:56,312
Oh.

1076
01:43:56,441 --> 01:43:58,849
Sally. I'm sorry.

1077
01:43:58,985 --> 01:44:01,025
I'm sorry, darling.

1078
01:44:01,154 --> 01:44:03,194
Hey, don't run out on me, you...

1079
01:44:03,323 --> 01:44:05,362
These are two friends of mine.

1080
01:44:05,492 --> 01:44:08,327
Sally, wait a minute. Sally, Sally.

1081
01:44:08,453 --> 01:44:10,659
My wife, Sally. This is...

1082
01:44:10,789 --> 01:44:12,828
- What was your name?
- Monty.

1083
01:44:14,668 --> 01:44:16,707
- Hey!
-

1084
01:44:16,836 --> 01:44:20,585
I don't know who they are. Who are you?

1085
01:44:20,715 --> 01:44:24,298
-
- This is my wife, Sally.

1086
01:44:24,427 --> 01:44:29,220
Fish. There's two things that smell
like fish. One of them's fish.

1087
01:44:32,519 --> 01:44:35,092
- They laughed, didn't they?
- Go on, already.

1088
01:44:35,230 --> 01:44:41,600
"Avoid loud and aggressive persons.
They are vexatious to the spirit."

1089
01:44:41,736 --> 01:44:43,776
"Keep interested in your own career."

1090
01:44:43,905 --> 01:44:50,987
"However humble, it is a real possessión
in the changing fortunes of time."

1091
01:44:51,121 --> 01:44:55,332
What is that tank for up there?
What's that turtle's name?

1092
01:44:55,458 --> 01:44:57,866
- Let's give him a drink.
- No.

1093
01:44:58,003 --> 01:45:01,087
No, no. Don't put beer in the tank.

1094
01:45:01,214 --> 01:45:07,050
Wait! You'll kill the goddamn...
No! You ain't feeding no turtle.

1095
01:45:08,304 --> 01:45:12,883
You nickel-dick. That's not even a real...
That's a plastic turtle.

1096
01:45:13,018 --> 01:45:17,514
Don't look at that turtle.
I don't want you to look at that turtle.

1097
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:22,224
You hear about the female peanut
walking down the street at night?

1098
01:45:22,360 --> 01:45:24,400
She was assaulted.

1099
01:45:28,116 --> 01:45:33,537
- That's the third time he's told that joke!
- She was a salted and he was insulted!

1100
01:46:08,323 --> 01:46:10,362
Bob?

1101
01:46:11,117 --> 01:46:13,157
Bob.

1102
01:46:22,921 --> 01:46:25,127
- Captain Hyde?
- Yeah.

1103
01:46:25,256 --> 01:46:27,296
The major's ready.

1104
01:46:40,396 --> 01:46:42,603
Major Haller, this is Captain Hyde.

1105
01:46:42,732 --> 01:46:46,979
- Captain Hyde. This is Mr Ott.
- How do you do, sir?

1106
01:46:47,112 --> 01:46:49,519
- Mr Roberts.
- Captain. How are you?

1107
01:46:49,656 --> 01:46:53,985
They're with the FBI.
Would you like to have a seat?

1108
01:46:55,120 --> 01:46:56,946
No, thanks.

1109
01:46:57,080 --> 01:47:02,454
Well, Captain, what can you tell us
about Luke Martin?

1110
01:47:42,333 --> 01:47:44,373
Aren't you gonna park?

1111
01:47:48,673 --> 01:47:51,923
- What are you gonna do?
- Drive.

1112
01:47:53,928 --> 01:47:56,300
Well... I'll come with you.

1113
01:47:56,431 --> 01:48:00,049
I'd just like to be by myself.

1114
01:48:01,352 --> 01:48:03,392
Please.

1115
01:48:12,614 --> 01:48:14,653
Are you gonna be long?

1116
01:48:16,618 --> 01:48:18,657
No.

1117
01:48:32,258 --> 01:48:39,008
When that gun goes off, you gotta
uncoil like a spring. Just release.

1118
01:48:39,140 --> 01:48:41,180
Swimmers, take your marks.

1119
01:48:41,309 --> 01:48:46,600
You gotta put everything you have
into that moment, right?

1120
01:48:46,731 --> 01:48:52,105
And get as far toward the... I used
to think about the other end of the pool.

1121
01:48:52,237 --> 01:48:54,276
Are you Luke Martin?

1122
01:48:55,365 --> 01:48:58,449
- Depends.
- I'm Bob Hyde.

1123
01:49:02,622 --> 01:49:06,406
Uh... Let's take a little break, Mark, OK?

1124
01:49:15,969 --> 01:49:18,839
I told Sally I was going to do this.

1125
01:49:20,598 --> 01:49:24,382
You have a right to know about
the surveillance. They watched the house.

1126
01:49:24,519 --> 01:49:28,102
They got pictures. They got tapes.

1127
01:49:36,531 --> 01:49:38,570
Thanks for...

1128
01:49:40,368 --> 01:49:42,740
for letting me know.

1129
01:50:05,518 --> 01:50:09,101
That's all I had to say.

1130
01:50:09,230 --> 01:50:12,314
The rest is up to Sally.

1131
01:50:14,152 --> 01:50:16,191
I guess.

1132
01:50:18,740 --> 01:50:20,779
See you.

1133
01:50:32,003 --> 01:50:34,042
<i>Now the time has come</i>

1134
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:37,880
<i>No place to run</i>...

1135
01:50:56,944 --> 01:50:58,771
Hello.

1136
01:51:00,531 --> 01:51:03,236
Luke. What? How am I taking what?

1137
01:51:03,368 --> 01:51:06,203
He didn't tell you?

1138
01:51:06,329 --> 01:51:08,571
I could have sworn that...

1139
01:51:09,957 --> 01:51:14,666
Listen. They had some surveillance on me
because of the gate thing.

1140
01:51:14,796 --> 01:51:16,835
Yeah?

1141
01:51:18,466 --> 01:51:20,505
Oh, my God!

1142
01:51:20,635 --> 01:51:24,300
Listen. I'm gonna be here.
If you need me, call me.

1143
01:51:24,430 --> 01:51:26,719
I'm just here.

1144
01:53:12,538 --> 01:53:15,112
I wanted to talk to you.

1145
01:53:17,376 --> 01:53:21,421
You seem so far away from me
since you came back.

1146
01:53:23,007 --> 01:53:25,463
I just... I've been scared.

1147
01:53:31,140 --> 01:53:33,180
I love you.

1148
01:53:34,894 --> 01:53:36,933
I do.

1149
01:53:41,317 --> 01:53:46,193
I'm not going to make excuses
for what happened.

1150
01:53:46,322 --> 01:53:49,157
It happened.
I needed somebody. I was lonely.

1151
01:53:49,283 --> 01:53:51,525
- Don't bullshit me.
- It's not...

1152
01:53:51,661 --> 01:53:54,330
- Bob, I was lonely.
- Don't bullshit me.

1153
01:53:54,455 --> 01:53:56,614
- It's not bullshit.
- It's bullshit!

1154
01:53:56,749 --> 01:53:58,789
- Bob, please...
- It's bullshit!

1155
01:53:58,918 --> 01:54:01,539
Everybody needs somebody,
for Christ's sake!

1156
01:54:01,671 --> 01:54:04,340
If it's over with us, it's over!

1157
01:54:05,883 --> 01:54:08,339
You're saying
you won't even make the effort?

1158
01:54:08,469 --> 01:54:13,012
What I'm saying is...
I do not belong in this house!

1159
01:54:13,140 --> 01:54:16,924
- And they say I don't belong over there!
- Who's "they"?

1160
01:54:17,061 --> 01:54:20,430
The people that make the decisions
about the fucking war!

1161
01:54:20,565 --> 01:54:25,025
- Bob, I don't wanna talk about the war.
- What, then? The fucking marriage?

1162
01:54:25,152 --> 01:54:26,611
Think about that.

1163
01:54:26,737 --> 01:54:29,359
I can't talk to you
when you're shouting at me.

1164
01:54:29,490 --> 01:54:34,864
I wanna be your husband.
I just don't deserve to be your husband.

1165
01:54:36,163 --> 01:54:38,833
I don't deserve the fucking medal either.

1166
01:54:38,958 --> 01:54:42,576
How can they give you a medal for a war
they don't even want you to fight?

1167
01:54:42,712 --> 01:54:44,953
- Who is that?
- Bob? Sally? Can I talk to you?

1168
01:54:45,089 --> 01:54:51,459
- It's Luke. Let me tell him to go away.
- Wait a minute. You just wait right there.

1169
01:55:10,281 --> 01:55:14,610
I don't wanna make anything
more complicated than it already is.

1170
01:55:16,370 --> 01:55:21,957
I just thought there might be a few things
that... we should talk about.

1171
01:55:22,084 --> 01:55:25,785
Well, they're not very complicated.

1172
01:55:25,922 --> 01:55:28,294
It's actually very simple.

1173
01:55:34,055 --> 01:55:38,004
- I don't belong here.
- You belong here.

1174
01:55:39,268 --> 01:55:44,310
I just wanted to get things straight,
what's going on with me,

1175
01:55:44,440 --> 01:55:47,109
so you know where I'm coming from
and what happened.

1176
01:55:47,234 --> 01:55:50,070
I know where you're coming from.

1177
01:55:51,697 --> 01:55:53,856
And I know what happened.

1178
01:55:55,826 --> 01:56:00,038
I've just gotta figure out for myself

1179
01:56:01,207 --> 01:56:04,825
what happened
and how I'm gonna deal with it.

1180
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:07,000
- I can understand that.
- Bullshit!

1181
01:56:07,129 --> 01:56:09,169
- Don't.
- You jodie fuck!

1182
01:56:09,298 --> 01:56:12,085
You get back! Get back, slope cunt!

1183
01:56:15,805 --> 01:56:21,890
Now you, jodie motherfucker, explain
to me how it is you understand anything.

1184
01:56:22,019 --> 01:56:26,811
I understand because I'm a brother and
I've been in the same place you're at now.

1185
01:56:26,941 --> 01:56:30,357
That's why I feel bad that I made it
harder for you than it already is.

1186
01:56:30,486 --> 01:56:32,526
That's bullshit.

1187
01:56:34,240 --> 01:56:37,940
She's here because she loves you.
There was never any question of that.

1188
01:56:38,077 --> 01:56:41,528
- Don't tell me that, goddamnit!
- It's true, Bob.

1189
01:56:41,664 --> 01:56:44,581
Bullshit! Bullshit!

1190
01:56:44,709 --> 01:56:48,208
If you give her a chance,
she can help you.

1191
01:56:50,256 --> 01:56:54,384
She wants to listen to you
and she wants to understand you.

1192
01:56:54,510 --> 01:56:56,835
Say something else, fuck.

1193
01:56:59,306 --> 01:57:02,058
Say something else, fuck.

1194
01:57:07,189 --> 01:57:09,763
I'm not the enemy.

1195
01:57:11,861 --> 01:57:15,645
Maybe the enemy is the fucking war.

1196
01:57:17,908 --> 01:57:24,278
But you don't want to kill anybody here.
You have enough ghosts to carry around.

1197
01:57:36,844 --> 01:57:39,300
Look at me. I'm...

1198
01:57:41,348 --> 01:57:43,388
My hand.

1199
01:57:49,273 --> 01:57:51,313
I was shaking.

1200
01:57:53,569 --> 01:57:55,609
I'm sorry.

1201
01:57:58,991 --> 01:58:01,067
I'm fucked.

1202
01:58:33,484 --> 01:58:37,861
I just wanna be a hero. That's all.

1203
01:58:40,866 --> 01:58:43,488
I just wanna be a fucking hero.

1204
01:58:45,037 --> 01:58:50,376
One day in my life, one moment,
I wanna go out a hero.

1205
01:58:52,545 --> 01:58:58,998
That way I would have done something
that was mine, that I've done.

1206
01:59:34,128 --> 01:59:36,879
Enemy forces had captured
the north side of the bridge

1207
01:59:37,006 --> 01:59:40,505
when Lieutenant Roscoe
charged forward firing his rifle.

1208
01:59:40,634 --> 01:59:44,502
Lieutenant Roscoe's actions
so unnerved the enemy, they withdrew,

1209
01:59:44,638 --> 01:59:47,556
allowing the lieutenant
to secure the enemy position

1210
01:59:47,683 --> 01:59:51,811
until the rest of his company could move
forward and consolidate their forces.

1211
01:59:51,937 --> 01:59:55,721
Lieutenant Roscoe maintained
the position against repeated attacks

1212
01:59:55,858 --> 01:59:58,479
and, though wounded,
continued to inspire his men

1213
01:59:58,611 --> 02:00:01,280
until reinforcements arrived
the following day.

1214
02:00:01,405 --> 02:00:05,533
Lieutenant Roscoe has upheld the highest
traditions of the Marine Corps

1215
02:00:05,659 --> 02:00:08,067
and of the United States naval service.

1216
02:00:08,203 --> 02:00:14,456
The Marine Corps builds body,
mind and spirit. Thank you.

1217
02:00:18,964 --> 02:00:22,832
And now, with a different perspective,
we have Luke Martin,

1218
02:00:22,968 --> 02:00:26,053
combat veteran of the Marine Corps.

1219
02:00:44,239 --> 02:00:48,451
- Sergeant, mind if I ask you a question?
- No, sir.

1220
02:00:49,662 --> 02:00:53,161
Just call me Sergeant - that's what I was.

1221
02:00:54,249 --> 02:00:56,408
- Where were you stationed?
- Da Nang.

1222
02:01:05,719 --> 02:01:09,634
I thought I'd go get some steaks
for a barbecue. Would you like that?

1223
02:01:11,642 --> 02:01:15,426
It's been a long time
since you've lit a barbecue.

1224
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:19,018
The charcoal's under the kitchen sink.

1225
02:01:19,149 --> 02:01:23,811
I'm gonna see if Vi
wants to come with me. See you later.

1226
02:01:40,504 --> 02:01:45,462
You want to be a part of it
and patriotic and go out and...

1227
02:01:45,592 --> 02:01:48,593
get your licks in for the US of A.

1228
02:01:51,432 --> 02:01:57,636
And when you get over there,
it's a totally different situation.

1229
02:01:59,231 --> 02:02:01,271
I mean...

1230
02:02:02,860 --> 02:02:06,063
you grow up real quick

1231
02:02:06,196 --> 02:02:10,064
because all you're seeing is a lot of death.

1232
02:02:28,510 --> 02:02:32,638
<i>Once I was a soldier</i>

1233
02:02:34,558 --> 02:02:39,434
<i>And I fought on foreign sands for you</i>

1234
02:02:40,856 --> 02:02:44,557
<i>Once I was a hunter</i>...

1235
02:02:46,403 --> 02:02:49,155
And I know some of you
are gonna look at that uniform

1236
02:02:49,281 --> 02:02:54,738
and you're gonna remember all the films
and think about the glory of other wars

1237
02:02:54,870 --> 02:02:57,443
and think about some vague...

1238
02:02:59,708 --> 02:03:02,116
patriotic feeling

1239
02:03:02,252 --> 02:03:05,752
and go off and fight this turkey too.

1240
02:03:05,881 --> 02:03:09,250
<i>Soon there'll be another</i>

1241
02:03:11,595 --> 02:03:16,340
<i>To tell you I was just a lie</i>

1242
02:03:17,601 --> 02:03:24,398
<i>And sometimes I wonder</i>

1243
02:03:24,525 --> 02:03:29,519
<i>Just for a while</i>

1244
02:03:29,655 --> 02:03:32,490
<i>Will you ever</i>...

1245
02:03:32,616 --> 02:03:36,863
I'm telling you it ain't like it is
in the movies. I didn't have a choice.

1246
02:03:36,995 --> 02:03:41,741
When I was your age, all I got was
some guy standing up like that man

1247
02:03:41,875 --> 02:03:43,951
and giving me bullshit, which I caught.

1248
02:03:44,086 --> 02:03:47,585
I was really in good shape then.
I was captain of the football team.

1249
02:03:47,714 --> 02:03:52,756
I wanted to be a war hero, man.
I wanted to go out and kill for my country.

1250
02:03:53,804 --> 02:03:57,884
<i>Once I was a lover</i>

1251
02:03:59,810 --> 02:04:04,519
<i>And I searched behind your eyes for you</i>

1252
02:04:06,191 --> 02:04:10,236
<i>And soon there'll be another</i>...

1253
02:04:10,362 --> 02:04:16,566
And now I'm here to tell you that
I have killed for my country or whatever

1254
02:04:16,702 --> 02:04:19,240
and I don't feel good about it.

1255
02:04:23,208 --> 02:04:26,909
Because there's not
enough reason, man...

1256
02:04:33,427 --> 02:04:39,845
to feel a person die in your hands
or to see your best buddy get blown away.

1257
02:04:44,062 --> 02:04:47,763
I'm here to tell you it's a lousy thing, man.

1258
02:04:47,900 --> 02:04:50,355
I don't see any reason for it.

1259
02:04:54,323 --> 02:04:58,237
And there's a lot of shit
that I did over there

1260
02:04:58,368 --> 02:05:01,572
that I find fucking hard to live with.

1261
02:05:01,705 --> 02:05:04,196
And I don't wanna see
people like you coming back

1262
02:05:04,333 --> 02:05:08,377
and having to face the rest of your lives
with that shit. It's as simple as that.

1263
02:05:08,503 --> 02:05:14,708
I don't feel sorry for myself. I'm a lot
fucking smarter now than when I went.

1264
02:05:16,720 --> 02:05:19,045
And I'm just telling you...

1265
02:05:21,183 --> 02:05:24,137
that there's a choice to be made here.

1266
02:05:25,604 --> 02:05:32,852
<i>Will you ever remember me?</i>

1267
02:05:37,366 --> 02:05:40,153
<i>Ever</i>

1268
02:05:41,245 --> 02:05:46,619
<i>Remember me?</i>

1269
02:06:13,402 --> 02:06:16,984
<i>You don't know what's going on</i>

1270
02:06:17,114 --> 02:06:21,028
<i>You've been away for far too long</i>

1271
02:06:21,159 --> 02:06:26,071
<i>You can't come back</i>
<i>and think you are still mine</i>

1272
02:06:27,374 --> 02:06:30,909
<i>You're out of touch, my baby</i>

1273
02:06:31,044 --> 02:06:34,828
<i>My poor discarded baby</i>

1274
02:06:34,965 --> 02:06:40,884
<i>I said, baby, baby, baby,</i>
<i>you're out of time</i>

1275
02:06:42,556 --> 02:06:49,602
<i>Well, baby, baby, baby,</i>
<i>you're out of time</i>

1276
02:06:49,730 --> 02:06:56,266
<i>I said, baby, baby, baby,</i>
<i>you're out of time</i>

1277
02:06:56,695 --> 02:06:59,400
<i>You are all left out</i>

1278
02:07:02,409 --> 02:07:05,078
<i>Out of there without a doubt</i>

1279
02:07:05,203 --> 02:07:10,364
<i>Cos baby, baby, baby,</i>
<i>you're out of time</i>

1280
02:07:13,962 --> 02:07:17,711
<i>A girl who wants to run away</i>

1281
02:07:17,841 --> 02:07:21,590
<i>Discovers that she's had her day</i>

1282
02:07:21,720 --> 02:07:25,883
<i>It's no good you thinking</i>
<i>that you are still mine</i>

1283
02:07:28,143 --> 02:07:31,594
<i>You're out of touch, my baby</i>

1284
02:07:31,730 --> 02:07:35,348
<i>My poor unfaithful baby</i>

1285
02:07:35,484 --> 02:07:40,644
<i>I said, baby, baby, baby,</i>
<i>you're out of time</i>...

1286
02:07:41,305 --> 02:07:47,376
