2
00:00:24,479 --> 00:00:27,231
Why am I so devoted?

3
00:00:29,734 --> 00:00:32,190
It is not in the family.

4
00:00:34,197 --> 00:00:39,536
My parents are quite distant.
Also opposed.

5
00:00:43,498 --> 00:00:48,207
But some people are just different.

6
00:00:48,336 --> 00:00:51,835
Some people are predisposed to believe.

7
00:00:51,965 --> 00:00:55,416
A type flash between their eyes.

8
00:00:58,555 --> 00:01:01,472
They are not afraid of eternity.

9
00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:03,888
They are familiar with it.

10
00:01:07,146 --> 00:01:11,358
And when they bind
with the soul of another...

11
00:01:11,484 --> 00:01:14,236
they consider that bond as sacred.

12
00:01:17,657 --> 00:01:20,492
I was always such a person.

13
00:01:21,244 --> 00:01:25,455
It did take a while before I realized it.

14
00:01:29,502 --> 00:01:33,167
If nuns take their vows...

15
00:01:33,298 --> 00:01:38,505
They go on the church floor are
and pray for strength.

16
00:01:41,681 --> 00:01:43,721
I've also done.

17
00:01:44,893 --> 00:01:50,267
And if it was up to me situated
would thus end the story.

18
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,810
Joline?

19
00:01:55,361 --> 00:01:57,401
Carl, you can not see me.

20
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,938
You look great.

21
00:02:00,074 --> 00:02:03,574
You can not come here.
That brings misfortune.

22
00:02:03,703 --> 00:02:05,909
Are you serious?

23
00:02:06,706 --> 00:02:10,371
Where is your flower?
- In my hand. That brings happiness.

24
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:13,419
And because you're my daisy.

25
00:02:13,546 --> 00:02:17,330
I love daisies.
- I know.

26
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:19,709
But now I'm crushed.

27
00:02:22,347 --> 00:02:24,672
I love so dearly.

28
00:02:39,572 --> 00:02:42,407
How are you?
- Excellent.

29
00:02:42,534 --> 00:02:47,575
Is anyone there?
- Yes, they are all waiting.

30
00:03:41,593 --> 00:03:46,338
What is it, Chicky?
- I want to talk to you about Love Army.

31
00:03:46,472 --> 00:03:51,597
Matt and Duey booked for
Space Ass Tour in Japan.

32
00:03:51,728 --> 00:03:54,764
Do you let your band to Japan?

33
00:03:54,898 --> 00:03:59,643
They had to. Where they can earn a lot
yen.

34
00:03:59,777 --> 00:04:03,858
You begged me if I wanted to book. You remember?

35
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:09,779
Yes, I'm mad because they Rufus
the drummer, have preserved.

36
00:04:09,913 --> 00:04:13,862
If there is someone in the band?
- Sure. I.

37
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,416
Hold me now do not be fooled.
- What do you mean?

38
00:04:17,545 --> 00:04:22,006
I have booked a whole band,
and not a person.

39
00:04:22,133 --> 00:04:27,340
But I'm a great bass player.
- Yeah, but can you sing?

40
00:04:27,472 --> 00:04:30,259
Not really.
- You sing in a shower?

41
00:04:30,391 --> 00:04:34,888
Jo, I'm a damn good one,
brilliant bass.

42
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:36,563
I know too.

43
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:38,978
Your say on the show?

44
00:04:40,276 --> 00:04:43,526
Have I promised this occur?
- Yup.

45
00:04:43,655 --> 00:04:45,232
Is it then?

46
00:04:49,285 --> 00:04:51,741
You're the Love Army now.

47
00:04:51,871 --> 00:04:54,445
Joline, you're the best.

48
00:04:56,084 --> 00:05:00,081
Are you guys still here?
- I still break.

49
00:05:00,213 --> 00:05:05,634
I flirt with your brother, but I'm not sure I've
success. I have success?

50
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,465
Yes, you have some success.

51
00:05:09,264 --> 00:05:11,340
Jo, this picture is Carl.

52
00:05:11,474 --> 00:05:14,428
Say just about anything.
- Why not?

53
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:19,353
He wants to make news photos
and not photographing food.

54
00:05:19,482 --> 00:05:21,439
Food is still news?

55
00:05:21,568 --> 00:05:26,028
Take that series over patties.
That there are so many.

56
00:05:26,155 --> 00:05:31,031
He wants to take pictures of important events.

57
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,078
He is depressed all those souffle's.

58
00:05:34,205 --> 00:05:39,033
I give a birthday party for him. Are you?

59
00:05:41,004 --> 00:05:43,080
He acted only birthday?

60
00:05:43,214 --> 00:05:47,259
That was eight months ago.
He is there to now.

61
00:05:47,385 --> 00:05:51,134
Sean, you can not all the time
sit on the toilet.

62
00:05:51,264 --> 00:05:55,344
Nice of you that you Carl tries to cheer.

63
00:05:55,476 --> 00:05:57,765
He does it so often for me.

64
00:05:57,896 --> 00:06:03,138
I also have masses cool
friends to whom I can imagine.

65
00:06:03,276 --> 00:06:04,936
Here we go again.

66
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:08,189
Meg, it is "in prosperity and adversity."

67
00:06:08,323 --> 00:06:13,198
Is that "until death do you part?"
Or "until long as it's fun"?

68
00:06:13,328 --> 00:06:18,832
Until death do you part.
- How long they will remain so, do you think?

69
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:22,790
A few years.
- Forever, Meg.

70
00:06:22,921 --> 00:06:28,163
Some believe what they say.
And I 'forever' said.

71
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,710
So I've pretty
despite it tomorrow is sold out?

72
00:06:32,847 --> 00:06:37,059
Did I say that you got free?
- Perfectly arranged.

73
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,763
Wait for me.

74
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:33,862
Hi, Jo. With Carl.
I remain still jut.

75
00:07:33,992 --> 00:07:37,989
I have to photograph a pancake breakfast.

76
00:07:38,121 --> 00:07:43,910
They understood here apparently
under photojournalism.

77
00:07:44,043 --> 00:07:49,251
Sorry, Jo.
I feel a little down.

78
00:07:49,382 --> 00:07:51,838
I have to be here by myself.

79
00:07:51,968 --> 00:07:56,262
I just wanted to let you know that I love you.

80
00:08:14,991 --> 00:08:19,653
Sorry, I'll call you up?
- Does not matter. What is up?

81
00:08:19,787 --> 00:08:23,038
Nothing.
- Where is Carl?

82
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:31,246
You know how long Carl stays away?
You may continue but I do not live alone.

83
00:08:31,382 --> 00:08:35,510
Think you inmates
still awake?

84
00:08:35,637 --> 00:08:39,551
I do not know. Perhaps.

85
00:08:39,682 --> 00:08:42,138
Do they have anything in common?

86
00:08:42,268 --> 00:08:45,388
Yes, of course. Why do you ask?

87
00:08:45,522 --> 00:08:48,891
Because I in Jenny's bed can sleep...

88
00:08:49,025 --> 00:08:52,476
and then sleep with Jenny Mimi.

89
00:08:52,612 --> 00:08:57,523
Whether she dives but someone else
the suitcase.

90
00:08:57,659 --> 00:08:59,450
What do you mean?

91
00:08:59,577 --> 00:09:06,031
That they may sleep with whom she wants.
She is an adult. They may decide.

92
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:12,455
She still does not sleep in your bed?
- No. Not every night.

93
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:18,011
I never go to her room. She comes
always with me, I usually sleep all

94
00:09:18,137 --> 00:09:23,559
Then she comes to lie to me.
Sometimes it's nice to cuddle.

95
00:09:23,685 --> 00:09:26,602
She and Mimi are still a couple?

96
00:09:26,729 --> 00:09:30,430
That is true. I love Mimi.

97
00:09:30,567 --> 00:09:33,936
What I do not harm their relationship.

98
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:38,447
What they have is pure,
sincere and honest.

99
00:09:38,575 --> 00:09:42,786
It is very pure.

100
00:09:48,126 --> 00:09:49,917
Do not look at me.

101
00:09:52,672 --> 00:09:56,836
Jo, you've already seen
Jenny's new design?

102
00:09:56,968 --> 00:09:59,637
I'm going to the market.

103
00:09:59,762 --> 00:10:04,259
It is really quite different than what is now for sale.

104
00:10:09,147 --> 00:10:15,315
Hi, Mimi. Good Morning.
Did you see who is there?

105
00:10:19,115 --> 00:10:22,733
She rats burden.
Carl chases they usually...

106
00:10:22,869 --> 00:10:27,614
but he is out of town on business.
Do not you, Jo?

107
00:10:27,749 --> 00:10:31,699
Why she is here.
- You want a cup of coffee, Mimi?

108
00:10:37,175 --> 00:10:43,094
Is that your wedding ring? That tattoo?
Has Carl also so alone?

109
00:10:43,223 --> 00:10:45,844
Carl has eczema.
- What?

110
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,015
Eczema, a skin condition.

111
00:10:52,941 --> 00:10:56,392
Jenny has a wedding ring. Not True?

112
00:10:59,447 --> 00:11:03,990
Well, it's actually one ordinary ring.
He is in a safe.

113
00:11:04,118 --> 00:11:09,326
I did not know you were married.
This is intense.

114
00:11:09,457 --> 00:11:13,669
Unbelievable, right?
- Actually.

115
00:11:13,795 --> 00:11:19,798
I'm glad it's over.
I do not mean silly, Joline.

116
00:11:19,926 --> 00:11:24,635
What have I to do with it?
- You're married and that's nice.

117
00:11:24,764 --> 00:11:31,894
I tried marriage,
but it's not for me.

118
00:11:32,021 --> 00:11:35,058
Well for Joline,
another topic so.

119
00:11:35,191 --> 00:11:41,810
I have been married, and I do not think anyone
honestly wants to be.

120
00:11:42,907 --> 00:11:46,490
Because you were not really married.

121
00:11:46,619 --> 00:11:48,244
I told you so.

122
00:11:48,371 --> 00:11:52,784
You said you've tried it,
but that is not enough.

123
00:11:52,917 --> 00:11:56,618
You want it here
not.

124
00:11:56,754 --> 00:12:02,544
What did you say?
That your parents and my parents were not married?

125
00:12:02,677 --> 00:12:09,807
I do not say you were not married,
but you thought of something else.

126
00:12:09,934 --> 00:12:13,101
On what?
- Jenny, shut up.

127
00:12:20,361 --> 00:12:26,150
Listen, I do not stay, but thank
I could stay tonight.

128
00:12:26,284 --> 00:12:31,907
Sure?
- I want to be home when Carl comes.

129
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,531
Are you sure you save you?
- And you?

130
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:38,332
This is good, actually.

131
00:13:45,363 --> 00:13:48,566
Jo, I do not know when I return.

132
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:53,160
First I think clearly.
Love, Carl.

133
00:14:18,521 --> 00:14:22,104
How do you respond to a breach of trust?

134
00:14:22,233 --> 00:14:25,898
Especially if it's your first?

135
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:31,195
Love Army. And the song is called
Love Army Blues. Thank you.

136
00:14:32,869 --> 00:14:36,072
It is tempting to seek distraction.

137
00:14:36,206 --> 00:14:39,740
And you focus on your other commitments.

138
00:14:42,462 --> 00:14:47,836
You try to just do it.
And you pretend there's nothing wrong.

139
00:15:08,613 --> 00:15:14,283
It was delicious.
- All kits? Do you need anything?

140
00:15:15,203 --> 00:15:20,542
Another party would have
canceled. No, not Jo. I say that.

141
00:15:30,385 --> 00:15:34,596
Hi, Jo.
That cake looks delicious.

142
00:15:42,522 --> 00:15:46,105
A map of Carl? What he writes?

143
00:15:51,531 --> 00:15:56,656
I could not stay in New York.
Not only because of the work.

144
00:15:56,786 --> 00:15:59,704
It is definitely not you.

145
00:15:59,831 --> 00:16:06,035
I write you soon.
I am also sad. Love, Carl.

146
00:16:10,425 --> 00:16:12,583
State also where is he?

147
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:20,183
"The pear cactus catches the last rays of." That says nothing.

148
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,014
And the postmark is illegible.

149
00:16:45,043 --> 00:16:49,705
Tuck.
There are three kinds of chocolate.

150
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,295
I think it will probably taste.

151
00:16:55,678 --> 00:17:00,886
This is good, Jo. Now at least you know what you have
to him.

152
00:17:01,017 --> 00:17:05,229
That burden off your shoulders
cases. A hairy load.

153
00:17:05,355 --> 00:17:07,561
I do have some dope for you.

154
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:11,818
Everyone thinks I'm a dick.
But Carl is also a.

155
00:17:17,742 --> 00:17:21,443
Jo, come out.
- We are your friends.

156
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:26,288
It's more fun here.
Do we come in?

157
00:17:26,417 --> 00:17:28,991
Now we come in, okay?

158
00:17:52,068 --> 00:17:54,393
All kits?
- What do you do?

159
00:17:54,529 --> 00:17:58,990
My car keys are still
in the car. Stupid, huh?

160
00:17:59,117 --> 00:18:01,193
That is Chicky's car.

161
00:18:05,081 --> 00:18:06,741
What are you doing?

162
00:18:12,797 --> 00:18:15,086
What I'm doing now?

163
00:18:15,216 --> 00:18:19,000
I can not think straight.

164
00:18:19,137 --> 00:18:22,506
And it goes not about, you know.

165
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,053
I wanted to go to my mother
Long Island to kick the habit.

166
00:18:27,187 --> 00:18:30,638
If I had money,
I would go to.

167
00:18:30,773 --> 00:18:35,519
Then it would be fine.
I would get back on the right path.

168
00:18:38,156 --> 00:18:41,607
You never know how you find your faith.

169
00:18:41,743 --> 00:18:46,654
It can get through something ridiculous.
That's just it.

170
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:52,246
Do not ask someone you trust
is worth. Trust to trust.

171
00:18:52,378 --> 00:18:56,672
Who are you doing it?
For them, or for yourself?

172
00:18:59,636 --> 00:19:04,096
Why are you?
- How much does it cost to Long Island?

173
00:19:04,224 --> 00:19:07,343
I do not know. $ 40 or something.

174
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,848
This is not a joke, right?

175
00:19:21,491 --> 00:19:26,402
I had no idea whether he was going to rehab or not.

176
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:33,659
But I just wanted to believe.
And that was a great feeling.

177
00:19:43,388 --> 00:19:47,172
I want to say something.
Can it down?

178
00:19:47,308 --> 00:19:52,848
You were just rather negative,
but I do not want to hear.

179
00:19:52,981 --> 00:19:56,100
I do not bullshit about my husband.

180
00:19:56,484 --> 00:20:00,102
Does anyone know where my husband is?

181
00:20:02,156 --> 00:20:07,993
He went to the west.
- I know that. Does anyone know anything more?

182
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:14,709
This is a celebration,
now is danced there.

183
00:20:58,254 --> 00:21:03,379
What do you care where Carl is?

184
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:08,800
I mean: Who is your example?
Mom and Dad in any event.

185
00:21:09,724 --> 00:21:12,678
Were behind our neighbors?

186
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:19,857
Why an example? I do not know
surfer, I may therefore not surf?

187
00:21:26,241 --> 00:21:29,989
I think you all
very good picks.

188
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:35,362
I think you're very special.
- Thank you, Jay. Me too.

189
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:44,506
Jay, I'm married.
- Pardon Me.

190
00:21:44,634 --> 00:21:50,221
And I'm your sister.
- I know. That was really intense.

191
00:22:11,202 --> 00:22:17,490
Most relationships fail because
partners wait for something to happen.

192
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:22,583
But if you want someone
stays with you, you should invest...

193
00:22:22,714 --> 00:22:25,750
even though they behave like an idiot.

194
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:32,090
If I frugal would do...

195
00:22:32,223 --> 00:22:37,763
I had enough money to search two ordinary
or a big state.

196
00:22:37,896 --> 00:22:41,430
Everything was pointing in the direction
Texas.

197
00:22:47,488 --> 00:22:50,158
People know much more than they think.

198
00:22:50,283 --> 00:22:55,526
Sometimes you can get information
in a strange way.

199
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:04,037
The postmark was illegible,
but I thought I saw five letters.

200
00:23:04,172 --> 00:23:07,623
And there are no cacti
in Idaho or Maine.

201
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:14,301
And wanderers go to Texas
to get lost even more.

202
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,341
Have you seen this man?

203
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,551
That is a statistical fact.

204
00:23:22,941 --> 00:23:26,107
Probably because it is so big.

205
00:24:01,646 --> 00:24:08,064
A stranger in a desert is 5 times
scarier than a stranger in New York.

206
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:13,780
I wish I could say
that is not true.

207
00:24:22,584 --> 00:24:24,208
I'll see you.

208
00:24:41,978 --> 00:24:44,647
Stay away from my purse.

209
00:24:57,911 --> 00:25:00,580
A slap...

210
00:25:08,129 --> 00:25:13,550
Mike, are you done with her?
Let's go. Come on.

211
00:25:13,676 --> 00:25:15,336
Jiffy.

212
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,522
I've been coming

213
00:25:27,649 --> 00:25:32,643
Because you are so like Blondie,
do you keep her.

214
00:25:33,863 --> 00:25:36,615
Fuck.
- Wait for me.

215
00:25:36,741 --> 00:25:41,486
You're a dick.
- I was hard at work for you.

216
00:25:41,621 --> 00:25:43,910
I have rings for you.

217
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:50,493
I want nothing from you. You're a dick.
- Wait. Just look at this ring.

218
00:25:51,464 --> 00:25:53,042
For you.

219
00:25:58,721 --> 00:26:02,422
Thank you.
- No thanks.

220
00:26:15,071 --> 00:26:17,147
Are you okay?

221
00:26:18,283 --> 00:26:20,074
Are you stuck?

222
00:26:24,706 --> 00:26:26,745
Can I have my purse back?

223
00:26:29,335 --> 00:26:32,539
Give her the damn bag now but.

224
00:26:35,633 --> 00:26:39,085
Let my arm loose. Release me.

225
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,109
Where are you now?
- In Texas.

226
00:26:53,234 --> 00:26:57,943
How is it there?
- Quite intense.

227
00:26:58,072 --> 00:27:00,445
Interesting, but vehemently.

228
00:27:00,575 --> 00:27:03,944
I'll call you tomorrow, Meg. Bye.

229
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,828
Pardon, go
use the discount coupons?

230
00:27:19,677 --> 00:27:21,670
With Joline from Room 1 01.

231
00:27:21,804 --> 00:27:24,474
Do you have a moment?
- Yeah, you know.

232
00:27:39,822 --> 00:27:42,989
That's okay. Thank you.

233
00:28:39,215 --> 00:28:42,216
You would think that I would fly off Carl.

234
00:28:42,343 --> 00:28:47,930
But something held me and said I had to give
man some space.

235
00:28:48,057 --> 00:28:50,762
That he was not ready for.

236
00:28:52,061 --> 00:28:58,811
That's the hardest one relationship.
You give partner space.

237
00:28:58,943 --> 00:29:01,517
How much space will be needed.

238
00:29:03,489 --> 00:29:06,443
You must rely on your feelings.

239
00:29:49,702 --> 00:29:51,280
What are you doing?

240
00:29:52,956 --> 00:29:54,616
Nothing.

241
00:29:56,834 --> 00:30:00,417
Do you bothering me?
- No, you know. Not at all.

242
00:30:00,547 --> 00:30:04,295
You arouses my interest.

243
00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:16,724
Do you want to drink a beer inside
?

244
00:30:18,857 --> 00:30:22,724
Well, come
I do with the beer out.

245
00:30:43,882 --> 00:30:46,503
Please.
- No, thank you.

246
00:30:54,017 --> 00:30:59,770
I called Niko, but you may also call me
Neil.

247
00:30:59,898 --> 00:31:02,852
Or what you want.

248
00:31:07,572 --> 00:31:13,195
I make things in newsprint and paper towel...

249
00:31:13,328 --> 00:31:16,661
and paint and glue, of course.

250
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:21,122
That's obvious, right?

251
00:31:29,135 --> 00:31:34,093
I'm here drove
because I was looking for my husband.

252
00:31:34,224 --> 00:31:38,767
I wanted to know if it went well with him. I Shizu him.

253
00:31:41,147 --> 00:31:44,979
I want him to see me only
when he's ready.

254
00:31:45,109 --> 00:31:49,356
I will not tell your secret.
- Thank you.

255
00:31:50,865 --> 00:31:56,986
So you're married to that guy
who lives down the house?

256
00:32:02,126 --> 00:32:04,000
Precisely with him.

257
00:32:04,128 --> 00:32:05,706
You know him?
- No.

258
00:32:12,595 --> 00:32:18,598
Could you maybe just
want to come in my humble stulpje?

259
00:32:19,435 --> 00:32:24,263
It's a mess, but cozy.
It is a sexy mess.

260
00:32:26,192 --> 00:32:29,027
Again, I'm married.

261
00:32:29,153 --> 00:32:34,943
Shall I tell you something?
I think that is just so exciting.

262
00:32:35,827 --> 00:32:41,830
No, I really mean that.
Women who are devoted to their husbands...

263
00:32:41,958 --> 00:32:44,912
winds me enormously.

264
00:32:45,044 --> 00:32:47,500
Is not that weird?
- Yes, that's it.

265
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:51,046
I know,
but I can not help it.

266
00:32:51,176 --> 00:32:58,590
Anyway, it's my problem.
I should keep it to myself.

267
00:32:58,725 --> 00:33:02,094
True.
- You hear me about it anymore.

268
00:33:02,228 --> 00:33:04,304
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

269
00:33:08,109 --> 00:33:10,185
Do you really want a beer?

270
00:33:11,988 --> 00:33:13,779
Come only.

271
00:33:40,058 --> 00:33:42,975
I'm Joline O'Neill Howell.

272
00:33:44,145 --> 00:33:47,728
I'm Carl's wife.
Carl Howell, the photographer.

273
00:33:47,857 --> 00:33:50,977
Course. Come in.

274
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:56,187
I did not even pay attention
when Carl told me about you.

275
00:33:56,324 --> 00:34:00,701
Does not.
- I do not watch often. Sit down.

276
00:34:00,828 --> 00:34:04,363
So you are Carl's better half?

277
00:34:04,499 --> 00:34:10,418
This is my wife.
Since last June. Her name is Suzanne.

278
00:34:11,297 --> 00:34:14,880
She's beautiful.
She looks happy.

279
00:34:15,009 --> 00:34:18,959
I hope so.
Third time lucky, they say.

280
00:34:19,097 --> 00:34:24,471
Three times for her.
This is my first time. For me it's new.

281
00:34:24,602 --> 00:34:29,763
And for you it's the last chance.
- Congratulations.

282
00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:36,151
I did not know you came. I
Carl just before a session sent out.

283
00:34:36,281 --> 00:34:39,566
May I ask what he's going to shoot?

284
00:34:39,701 --> 00:34:45,869
The chili cook-off in Cornudas.
That's right anyway, eh Ben?

285
00:34:45,999 --> 00:34:49,332
Yes, a cooking competition.
- You're kidding.

286
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:52,746
No, I thought not.

287
00:34:52,881 --> 00:34:56,214
Can you let someone else do not
?

288
00:34:56,342 --> 00:35:00,885
Carl does.
He will not disappoint me.

289
00:35:01,014 --> 00:35:04,180
I've noticed that he's eating well.

290
00:35:04,309 --> 00:35:08,805
I do not what to do.
I'm sure you understand your box.

291
00:35:08,938 --> 00:35:15,392
I would really just
tell how talented Carl.

292
00:35:15,528 --> 00:35:20,274
Carl would rather take pictures
about life and man.

293
00:35:20,408 --> 00:35:25,117
That kind of photos. He's at least
as well. Even better.

294
00:35:25,246 --> 00:35:29,659
Do you see that calf?
Carl would have highlighted that calf.

295
00:35:29,792 --> 00:35:35,463
These pictures are nothing compared to those of Carl. Not ugly intended.

296
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:39,670
I mean, if these are your photos.
Are these your photos?

297
00:35:45,767 --> 00:35:49,765
I say this because Carl
currently struggling.

298
00:35:49,896 --> 00:35:54,854
And that cooking competition makes it even ten times worse.

299
00:35:56,027 --> 00:35:58,779
Thanks for the information.

300
00:35:58,905 --> 00:36:04,860
Carl is still in his probation.
Any information is welcome.

301
00:36:04,994 --> 00:36:07,450
I have to get back to work.

302
00:36:08,706 --> 00:36:13,084
Have I said too much?
- You have expressed well.

303
00:36:13,211 --> 00:36:19,130
Did I mention that Carl appreciates her work,
otherwise he would not do it.

304
00:36:19,259 --> 00:36:22,462
I will soon tell
that you've been through.

305
00:36:22,595 --> 00:36:25,169
Just do not.
- Whatever you want.

306
00:36:25,306 --> 00:36:29,055
Forget
but most of what I said.

307
00:36:29,185 --> 00:36:31,392
That will not happen.

308
00:36:31,521 --> 00:36:34,142
He is really good.
- You said that already

309
00:36:34,274 --> 00:36:36,183
Very good..

310
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:36,980
Violence solves nothing.

311
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:46,736
You must suppress your tendency to use violence to. Either way.

312
00:38:56,624 --> 00:38:58,166
Yes, boy...

313
00:39:57,602 --> 00:39:59,262
yet one more time.

314
00:40:25,338 --> 00:40:28,007
You block the car of my uncle.

315
00:40:32,846 --> 00:40:34,553
You battery is empty.

316
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:40,595
I have no jumper cables. Do you?

317
00:40:42,272 --> 00:40:44,644
Are you a member of the roadside?

318
00:40:46,109 --> 00:40:52,028
Come on inside.
We then use my card. That they do not notice.

319
00:40:57,287 --> 00:41:00,288
I should have been on my work.

320
00:41:00,415 --> 00:41:03,369
But the others are always late.

321
00:41:15,221 --> 00:41:20,132
Is that Mexico?
- Yes, that is the limit. The Rio Grande.

322
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:23,218
They put me on hold.

323
00:41:26,691 --> 00:41:33,228
You seem very nice.
- Thank you. You too. Sit down.

324
00:41:36,743 --> 00:41:40,740
You know Carl long?
- You know Carl, too?

325
00:41:40,872 --> 00:41:45,119
I met him a few weeks ago.

326
00:41:45,251 --> 00:41:47,327
How do you know Carl?

327
00:41:48,963 --> 00:41:50,623
I'm his wife.

328
00:42:01,017 --> 00:42:06,260
I did not know. I swear:
I had no idea.

329
00:42:06,397 --> 00:42:10,063
You have to believe me.
- I believe you.

330
00:42:10,193 --> 00:42:16,480
What a fucking mess. I sit back
stuck with a married guy.

331
00:42:19,077 --> 00:42:25,578
I did not know he was married,
but I knew in my subconscious?

332
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:30,620
No idea.
- That should. This always happens to me.

333
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:36,383
It has to do with
confidence. I've read.

334
00:42:38,137 --> 00:42:41,803
I've done a banana in your tank.

335
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:46,430
Yesterday I made a banana
in your tank. Pardon Me.

336
00:42:46,563 --> 00:42:50,181
What's the effect?
- I do not know.

337
00:42:54,696 --> 00:42:58,195
Damn, T-Bo.
I give you no key.

338
00:42:58,324 --> 00:43:00,531
He was here yesterday.

339
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:06,414
How should I respond?
- Do What U Want. None of your business.

340
00:43:10,753 --> 00:43:13,458
What do you think of that reaction?

341
00:43:15,425 --> 00:43:20,252
Sorry, Carmen.
I will never do anything, you know.

342
00:43:20,388 --> 00:43:25,264
But I jerk that guy's New York
entrails from his body.

343
00:43:25,393 --> 00:43:29,260
The New York fucking guts
of that bastard.

344
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,945
What did you say?
- Nothing.

345
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,992
You should have said something.
- Nietes.

346
00:43:46,122 --> 00:43:50,286
Say something.
Come on, Carmen. Say something.

347
00:43:50,418 --> 00:43:53,834
I have to tell you anything.

348
00:43:53,963 --> 00:43:58,709
That's not possible.
- Yes it is, T-Bo.

349
00:43:58,843 --> 00:44:03,304
I have to tell you anything.
Absolutely nothing.

350
00:44:06,976 --> 00:44:12,315
But we felt something for each other.
You can not deny.

351
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:32,580
I'm awfully fond of you,
but I swear I love you.

352
00:45:03,783 --> 00:45:07,448
Okay?
- Yeah, nothing wrong.

353
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:13,368
Is that your husband?
- Man? He is not even my friend.

354
00:45:13,501 --> 00:45:16,953
I am eight times with him
slept.

355
00:45:17,088 --> 00:45:21,335
Carmen, listen.
There is something wrong with that boy.

356
00:45:21,467 --> 00:45:26,094
You should see him go and finish.

357
00:45:26,222 --> 00:45:28,262
I do not know where he lives.

358
00:45:28,391 --> 00:45:33,848
He always comes to visit me in
the restaurant when he is in town.

359
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:37,645
Does he know where Carl lives?
- No idea. How So?

360
00:45:37,775 --> 00:45:44,277
Because he New York guts
Carl will tear out. For That.

361
00:45:44,407 --> 00:45:47,242
Do you worry about Carl?
- Yup.

362
00:45:47,368 --> 00:45:51,448
I'm mad at him,
but he does not die.

363
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:59,330
Would I want this guy Carl
guts ripped out?

364
00:45:59,464 --> 00:46:01,207
Absolutely.

365
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:05,588
I learned a side of Carl
know that I did not like.

366
00:46:07,388 --> 00:46:15,016
But who has promised to protect him
in prosperity and adversity?

367
00:46:15,813 --> 00:46:20,310
At that moment I wished that it had been another.

368
00:46:20,443 --> 00:46:24,488
But that was not the case.
I promised.

369
00:46:26,908 --> 00:46:31,071
How long will you be here this time
?

370
00:46:31,204 --> 00:46:35,332
No idea. I want to know if he
morning goes to work.

371
00:46:35,458 --> 00:46:39,586
Why would he do that?
- I want to be sure.

372
00:46:52,934 --> 00:46:58,972
Can I tell you what I do with you
would do if you were to break your vow...

373
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:02,476
and I would go to bed?
- Come on, Neil.

374
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:07,735
I'm not saying I do, but I want to tell
only.

375
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:10,820
Sure? It's awfully sexy.

376
00:47:11,786 --> 00:47:15,866
You do not have to say.
Think just a moment.

377
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:21,585
Okay. Good. Do your eyes closed.
- Forget it.

378
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:25,331
Just do it simply.
I do you no harm.

379
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:46,652
What do I do?

380
00:47:49,949 --> 00:47:56,153
I do not know, but you can
'd better stop it.

381
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:11,677
I ask if you want to quit
with what you're doing.

382
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:17,846
Why do not open your eyes?

383
00:48:20,021 --> 00:48:22,975
I do them open when you quit.

384
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:59,007
Have you told Carl that T-Bo?
- Yup.

385
00:48:59,143 --> 00:49:01,681
I also said that I'm
no longer wanted to see.

386
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:08,065
I do not know if he has been given the story about
T-Bo. Can be.

387
00:49:08,194 --> 00:49:10,068
Did you tell that I was there?

388
00:49:10,196 --> 00:49:12,818
Should it?
- No.

389
00:49:13,616 --> 00:49:17,484
How was work?
Does he have his job?

390
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:20,740
We have not talked about his work. How So?

391
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:22,534
So only.

392
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:28,336
Incidentally,
your brother this morning called.

393
00:49:28,464 --> 00:49:32,925
I gave him your number.
That you do not mind?

394
00:49:33,052 --> 00:49:35,674
No, we have nice chat.

395
00:49:35,805 --> 00:49:40,597
He said when I had to call?
- He called me.

396
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:44,060
He asked what I thought of this state.

397
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:51,895
What did you say?
- I said you've seen Carl...

398
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:56,490
but Carl yours yet.
And we both found strange.

399
00:49:56,618 --> 00:50:00,152
Carl is not yet ready.

400
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:05,080
We both found it
it all comes from one side.

401
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:08,495
That's not true.
- Do you want those chips yet?

402
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:14,549
I would expect that he would support me if I
thing going through.

403
00:50:14,677 --> 00:50:16,587
Really?
- Of Course.

404
00:50:16,721 --> 00:50:23,258
You do whether it's a spiritual thing.
If he comes from Tibet. Sit down.

405
00:50:24,437 --> 00:50:26,643
I've never been in Tibet.

406
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:30,473
What do you do now you wait until
Carl is ready for it?

407
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:33,777
Go to him only spy?

408
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:37,523
Spy  I'm not.
I like him in the eye.

409
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:39,735
I protect him.

410
00:50:41,162 --> 00:50:44,745
What are you doing this afternoon?
- How Come?

411
00:50:44,874 --> 00:50:47,709
I want you to meet someone.

412
00:50:54,384 --> 00:51:01,265
I never understood anything of that hocus-
pocus. Although it's in my blood.

413
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:05,887
But you are different.
You do have a predisposition.

414
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:09,055
Day Grandpa.

415
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:23,026
This is my girlfriend, Joline.
Joline, this is Cinco.

416
00:51:23,162 --> 00:51:28,370
They may call you anyway Cinco?
- They call me whatever she wants.

417
00:51:28,501 --> 00:51:30,909
It is an honor to meet you.

418
00:51:31,045 --> 00:51:35,672
Carmen told me of your special gifts.

419
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:39,169
She needs help, Grandpa.

420
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:42,554
She has problems with her husband.

421
00:51:44,809 --> 00:51:49,851
Carmen said that your wife
also had special gifts.

422
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:53,646
And you know her secrets.
- I was not there.

423
00:51:53,776 --> 00:51:56,564
Now I get a moment's peace.

424
00:51:56,696 --> 00:52:00,314
Everyone wants me to solve all sorts of things.

425
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,941
I brought Pepsi.

426
00:52:06,122 --> 00:52:08,613
Then get a few glasses.

427
00:52:12,837 --> 00:52:14,629
You live here pretty.

428
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:25,136
There's a rattlesnake in that vessel.
Take him at once. I miss him.

429
00:52:25,266 --> 00:52:27,555
A real rattlesnake?

430
00:52:27,685 --> 00:52:30,889
I have bewitched him.
Do not worry.

431
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:02,210
Do not. Put the lid back on.

432
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:11,265
Do not fool her.
- Who does that?

433
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:16,638
She has confidence in me.
That even my grandchildren.

434
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:18,685
Do not start again.

435
00:53:22,615 --> 00:53:26,993
Stop that. And you also get
no Pepsi me.

436
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:31,791
Come here. Sit down.

437
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:46,470
Blow once.

438
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:52,637
Again.

439
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:11,618
This may take a while.

440
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:18,960
Everyone knows what they mean rituals.

441
00:54:19,088 --> 00:54:23,964
No one needs to give meaning
to something, because it is already there

442
00:54:24,093 --> 00:54:27,961
It's already
before you are born.

443
00:54:28,097 --> 00:54:34,515
The sky is blue and the house is pink.
That goes for you and for me.

444
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:41,644
That house is not pink,
previously salmon.

445
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:08,300
I'm going inside.
Call me if you need me.

446
00:55:08,429 --> 00:55:11,347
Thanks. Bye.
- See you, Neil.

447
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:19,981
How did you find me?
- Carmen has brought me.

448
00:55:24,028 --> 00:55:28,904
I like that you are there,
but I can not go out with you.

449
00:55:29,033 --> 00:55:35,154
Listen, Jo. I think you should come home and this should
caps.

450
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,247
I really mean that.

451
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:39,996
Hi, my mother made it.

452
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:46,166
Thank you. This is my brother, Jay. Toby
lives in the pink salmon-colored house.

453
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:47,961
Hello, little Toby.

454
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:53,385
We were just here to talk.
I'll soon be here with you.

455
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:55,972
Thank your mother for me.

456
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:04,397
Carl
I can honestly pretty...

457
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:07,528
but I do not know whether he is worth it.

458
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:10,656
Does it matter whether he's worth?

459
00:56:10,783 --> 00:56:14,366
Suppose Carl his both legs
had lost.

460
00:56:14,495 --> 00:56:18,244
Should I dump him
for someone with good legs?

461
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:23,499
I have eternal loyalty to him promised
in front of you and God.

462
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:27,295
He is not in a wheelchair.
I mean...

463
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:31,886
That's an analogy.
He is mentally in a wheelchair.

464
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:35,968
He is mentally in a wheelchair?

465
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:43,558
You do not understand and I can not identify you.

466
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:47,356
So it seems better that you leave the car.

467
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:52,730
You're my brother and I love you.
But you must get off.

468
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:00,081
I'm in Texas.

469
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:16,305
Sometimes it is very heavy. Then
difficult to persevere.

470
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:22,974
It helps to talk with someone who understands the.

471
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:27,062
How do you do that?
- What?

472
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:29,565
His bite is deadly.
- Not for me.

473
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:34,322
I carved all with fangs
in my skin when I was little.

474
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:37,736
The first time I made a small scratch.

475
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:42,200
The second time I scratched harder.
It started to bleed.

476
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:46,248
The third time yet again louder, etc..

477
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:51,207
Some let them bite immediately.
- Who still die?

478
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:53,880
Some do, indeed.

479
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:59,254
But those who continue to live
be snake charmer.

480
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:04,731
They immediately get a reward.
And immediately force.

481
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:11,141
I do not. I must have patience,
because I'm not that brave.

482
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:15,905
I would like to call not brave, but stupid.

483
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:19,403
You can view it from two sides.

484
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:35,047
Here, I've done it in lime.
- Awesome. Thank you.

485
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:40,552
Now they suddenly do not want
talk to me, you know.

486
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:45,144
Why I'm the bogeyman?
Why are these anyway?

487
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:51,357
You have to wait and see. It makes no sense
to put her under pressure.

488
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:55,069
Waitress is that my margarita?

489
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:58,531
I'm worried about her.
- I know.

490
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:01,411
It's sweet of you
that you worry.

491
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:08,703
You have a nice family.
And so spiritual. That's you also fixed.

492
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:17,459
You think not that I mentally
is in a wheelchair or something?

493
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:24,049
Do you think of me?
- No, no, absolutely not.

494
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:26,928
Can I now my margarita?

495
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,307
I'll be back.

496
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:38,946
There she is.

497
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:49,417
Would they see us?
- So what? It's a car.

498
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:52,082
True. You are right.

499
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:56,626
I do not give her the idea
we spy on her.

500
00:59:56,759 --> 01:00:00,259
But we still do?

501
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:07,847
No, we fit just fine on her.
That's something else.

502
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:13,852
You see that?

503
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:17,231
Row something through.

504
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:20,697
Then she sees us.
- A little bit.

505
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:33,585
It seems Joline though.

506
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:36,548
True. And that is that man.

507
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:42,547
Do you think she looks?
- No, I think not.

508
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,254
Why not?
They can see everything.

509
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:50,386
Joline takes her promises
pretty seriously.

510
01:00:50,522 --> 01:00:55,943
If you only watch,
break your promise not? Even So?

511
01:00:56,069 --> 01:01:01,858
Is there whether he knows she looks.
- How so?

512
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:06,119
If he knows she looks, she
plays a role at all.

513
01:01:06,246 --> 01:01:11,750
But if he does not know, it's like he
plays with herself.

514
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:16,622
And that's okay, acceptable.

515
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:21,916
OK,
but suppose he knows she looks?

516
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:25,469
But they do not know that he knows that she looks.

517
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:30,391
So she thinks she just
is watching. Very innocent.

518
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:36,190
Because it all comes from one side.
If you are watching a movie.

519
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:42,771
It is. But if he knows that they
watching.

520
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:47,403
And she knows that he knows that she looks...

521
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,079
... then

522
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:59,873
Man, that's another intimacy.
- You got that right.

523
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:43,061
You can not always remain.

524
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:51,659
This gives a lot of protection, right?

525
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:53,660
Better I have not.

526
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:10,554
What is it?

527
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:15,924
Very strange.
- What's strange?

528
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:18,682
You remind me of my wife.

529
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:21,055
That is indeed strange.

530
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:25,517
You should do the following.

531
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:28,939
You break him in.
I do not care how.

532
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:31,909
I help him recover.

533
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:51,379
You leave everything untouched.
Show respect for things.

534
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:04,602
You put the sand in places you
expects him get hurt.

535
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:11,697
In places where you expect
that will be something to him.

536
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:17,945
Use your common sense.
Do not be economical. I've had enough of this stuff.

537
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:53,237
I did not think you'd see me.
- What are you doing here?

538
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:55,193
I rest for a while.

539
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:57,900
Why pour mud everywhere?

540
01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:02,534
It is sacred sand.
It protects you from T-Bo.

541
01:06:02,667 --> 01:06:04,161
Who?

542
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:08,872
Carmen told me that she had told you.

543
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:11,711
How do you know Carmen?

544
01:06:11,843 --> 01:06:18,296
Carl, I did not think you'd see me. I wanted to give you space.

545
01:06:18,433 --> 01:06:21,268
Jo, you must see.

546
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:23,935
Later, Toby. Good?

547
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:30,103
About Carmen. Am I hurt? Yup.
Am I evil. Yup.

548
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:33,819
We will have to work hard at it...

549
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:37,993
but I blame her anything.
She even my girlfriend.

550
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:43,992
She is very nice. And she has something
with Jay. My brother is also here.

551
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:55,044
I feel quite a bit
panicky, Jo. I'm sorry.

552
01:06:55,178 --> 01:06:58,713
I understand that.
That was not my intention.

553
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:02,348
Does not matter.
It's all my fault.

554
01:07:02,477 --> 01:07:09,310
I have not been honest and therefore
I have now that panicky feeling.

555
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:15,979
The you also surprised to see me here
and to see how I live...

556
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:18,653
and where I live. I understand that.

557
01:07:18,785 --> 01:07:24,455
I try to explain it in a letter. I have two versions.

558
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:34,372
Have you ever loved someone, Jo...

559
01:07:34,509 --> 01:07:37,794
with your whole heart and soul?

560
01:07:39,097 --> 01:07:45,978
And then one day you notice
they all suck your happiness.

561
01:07:46,104 --> 01:07:49,888
They did not mean to.
It was just the way.

562
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:55,730
Suddenly something good happens.
You hope it, because you're talking needed.

563
01:07:55,864 --> 01:08:02,531
You feel that you're drowning and you
needed something to go by.

564
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:05,497
And then you see something good come down on you.

565
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:07,865
It comes right at you.

566
01:08:08,001 --> 01:08:12,828
And if you want to grab it,
it goes to another.

567
01:08:12,964 --> 01:08:15,420
It looks like a bad joke.

568
01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:19,298
Suppose that another does not.
Would I get lucky?

569
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:25,052
I do not know, but my feeling
says maybe it is.

570
01:08:25,185 --> 01:08:29,977
You mean I bring you happiness?
- It may sound strange.

571
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:33,641
But I realize that I made a mistake somewhere.

572
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:37,560
Because everything went well,
until something changed.

573
01:08:37,697 --> 01:08:42,074
I realized only after a long time,
because I loved you...

574
01:08:42,202 --> 01:08:45,701
I completely lost the thread.

575
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:49,828
That marked you as well?
I saw you saw it too.

576
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:54,123
I had nothing to look at you, Jo.
Absolutely nothing.

577
01:08:54,255 --> 01:08:58,170
You made constant fun stuff.

578
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:02,213
And you had all earned.

579
01:09:02,347 --> 01:09:04,719
But where was I? Nowhere.

580
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:10,389
And that meant?
I had to leave to get things done.

581
01:09:10,522 --> 01:09:15,646
That was the only way to
no longer get lost.

582
01:09:15,777 --> 01:09:19,644
And I feel that I am now not far from.

583
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:24,407
Go, sit.
I want to show you something.

584
01:09:24,536 --> 01:09:28,664
Who took this photo?
Frontpage, eh?

585
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:30,450
And this?

586
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:33,584
And this? Carl Howell.

587
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:39,915
My boss believes in me.
I do not eat since Monday to do more.

588
01:09:40,051 --> 01:09:44,001
Since last Monday?
- Starting Monday, yes.

589
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:49,678
And he will not return whistle me
I feel it. And you see this house?

590
01:09:49,811 --> 01:09:56,608
This is a house of Casa Homes,
with option to buy. And I think about it.

591
01:09:56,734 --> 01:10:01,028
But this is only a small part.
- Which?

592
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:07,906
From the step I make.
Do you understand what I mean?

593
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:11,987
You understand best,
because you're smart enough.

594
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:18,412
I assumed that you understood me
and that meant a lot to me.

595
01:10:22,844 --> 01:10:26,129
I feel that I have said enough.

596
01:10:35,523 --> 01:10:40,730
I have the feeling that you only have to go. okay?

597
01:10:42,614 --> 01:10:46,113
I can not stand
that you stay longer.

598
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:11,237
It could be worse than
spiritual sitting in a wheelchair.

599
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:15,118
Some people are mentally in a coma.

600
01:12:15,248 --> 01:12:18,118
If you're married to someone like...

601
01:12:18,251 --> 01:12:21,750
is your vow
tested to the limit.

602
01:12:25,466 --> 01:12:29,760
Well, Jo. I was not very clear,
I know.

603
01:12:29,888 --> 01:12:33,553
I'm going to work
to express myself better...

604
01:12:33,683 --> 01:12:40,184
But this makes no sense. Let me
by myself clear. Come on, Jo.

605
01:12:42,984 --> 01:12:48,405
You need a license
to park there.

606
01:12:48,531 --> 01:12:52,743
It is Mexican territory.
They are very strict.

607
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:59,156
They often come along. It looks
or remote, but that's not it.

608
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:01,748
And that pile of my fence.

609
01:13:04,756 --> 01:13:07,211
It's my wood. From me.

610
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:14,970
From grandfather I learned how you could keep a vigil.

611
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:18,303
How to cleanse one's mind.

612
01:13:21,481 --> 01:13:27,234
He said not much, but I was
convinced that I could do it.

613
01:13:27,362 --> 01:13:30,232
Some things I had seen him.

614
01:13:30,365 --> 01:13:32,737
Other things I made myself.

615
01:13:33,493 --> 01:13:39,578
If a wake Carl not brought to his senses
, I would not know what does.

616
01:13:54,973 --> 01:14:01,260
More spiritual people know immediately that you are one sacred mission.

617
01:14:01,396 --> 01:14:06,223
They understand the situation immediately
and they keep their distance.

618
01:14:08,903 --> 01:14:14,942
But you also have people who do not
understand where you're doing.

619
01:14:19,747 --> 01:14:25,537
Because they have never seen the bigger picture.

620
01:14:38,766 --> 01:14:42,266
I looked again. Did you see it too?
- Yeah, it's crazy.

621
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:44,933
Jo, you saw that shooting star?

622
01:14:49,903 --> 01:14:55,359
Is Carmen there now?
Is that your Volkswagen, Carmen?

623
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:59,074
Fuck you, Carl.
Go back inside.

624
01:14:59,204 --> 01:15:03,248
Are you Jay?
Did you 'fuck you' to me?

625
01:15:03,374 --> 01:15:06,459
Yes, it's me, Jay. Fuck you.

626
01:15:06,586 --> 01:15:11,331
No, get yourself Fuck you, Jay.
Do you know why?

627
01:15:11,466 --> 01:15:15,416
I do not even talk to you.
I'm talking to Carmen.

628
01:15:15,553 --> 01:15:19,717
Fuck you, Carl.
- That said Carmen. Did you hear that?

629
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:24,310
Can you cared
what my neighbors think of this?

630
01:15:24,437 --> 01:15:29,146
They think you're a bunch of squatters.

631
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:32,027
What you say is yourself.

632
01:15:40,203 --> 01:15:46,621
In the desert can change people
in other beings.

633
01:15:46,751 --> 01:15:49,207
In a fox or a crow.

634
01:15:50,296 --> 01:15:53,879
Carl had turned into an asshole.

635
01:15:54,008 --> 01:15:57,792
I had to make my rituals
more extreme.

636
01:15:57,929 --> 01:15:59,637
Is that your husband?

637
01:16:01,266 --> 01:16:03,424
Well, you know.

638
01:16:11,025 --> 01:16:15,937
I would be quite a bit more time to spend with your...

639
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:21,493
but it feels a bit strange
because your husband right in the neighborhood.

640
01:16:21,619 --> 01:16:24,110
I mean, right across the street.

641
01:16:24,831 --> 01:16:27,073
It just feels weird.

642
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:34,838
Tomorrow I'm going to Toronto. I try
there to sell some of my work.

643
01:16:36,259 --> 01:16:39,046
But then I come back here again.

644
01:16:42,891 --> 01:16:46,306
I wish that you fit on my monkey.

645
01:16:46,436 --> 01:16:50,813
I usually make pinatas
but he is not.

646
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:53,894
You should not smash him.

647
01:16:56,279 --> 01:16:58,070
Take care of yourself.

648
01:17:03,494 --> 01:17:06,828
How do you know when you've gone too far
?

649
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:12,867
Sometimes you'll get clues...

650
01:17:13,004 --> 01:17:16,622
But you'll be too busy with your rituals...

651
01:17:16,758 --> 01:17:20,043
and not you see those signs.

652
01:17:22,347 --> 01:17:25,798
You have again broken with me, huh?

653
01:17:25,934 --> 01:17:29,184
I wonder why my window was broken...

654
01:17:29,312 --> 01:17:34,555
and then I find eggs under my bed.
Yes, yes. Eggs.

655
01:17:34,692 --> 01:17:40,944
Six, I do not know how they get there,
fucking raw eggs.

656
01:17:44,244 --> 01:17:47,494
This is far, Jo. Even for you.

657
01:17:47,622 --> 01:17:51,406
I'm concerned.
I'm really worried about you.

658
01:17:51,543 --> 01:17:55,042
I wanted to let you know.

659
01:17:55,171 --> 01:18:01,541
Should something happen, then you need
understand that you left me no choice.

660
01:18:24,909 --> 01:18:27,827
Enter. Give back.

661
01:18:30,874 --> 01:18:33,032
So it came.

662
01:18:34,586 --> 01:18:36,911
Why I recorded.

663
01:18:45,388 --> 01:18:49,552
Tell me what that man means to you.

664
01:18:49,684 --> 01:18:51,427
He is my husband.

665
01:18:51,561 --> 01:18:55,393
Exactly, yes. And you protected him?

666
01:18:56,941 --> 01:19:02,528
Against one T-Bo, if I'm not mistaken. And he's your husband?

667
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:05,277
No, he is not.

668
01:19:08,203 --> 01:19:11,785
Excuse me,
I read it wrong.

669
01:19:11,915 --> 01:19:19,210
It's good to find out what
these men mean to you...

670
01:19:19,339 --> 01:19:22,340
if we have a little more time.

671
01:19:22,467 --> 01:19:26,844
Hopefully writing in your journal
helped you.

672
01:19:26,971 --> 01:19:30,969
I think so.
- Good. I'm glad.

673
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:36,391
But maybe I should
a larger dose of medication.

674
01:19:42,987 --> 01:19:47,863
The medications we give, we do not give
for fun.

675
01:19:47,992 --> 01:19:53,532
Who knows, help them to see things differently. That's why I get them anyway?

676
01:19:53,665 --> 01:19:56,749
No, why do not we give them to you.

677
01:19:56,876 --> 01:20:00,791
We are not on a fast result from here.

678
01:20:00,922 --> 01:20:05,383
We do not look here for an easy way out.

679
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:11,264
Far too many people are looking for an easy way out.

680
01:20:11,391 --> 01:20:16,812
Hopefully you learn to break that pattern.

681
01:20:19,607 --> 01:20:24,400
I felt like I told a joke that no one understood.

682
01:20:24,529 --> 01:20:29,025
But I kept him tell
because I thought it was a good joke.

683
01:20:30,869 --> 01:20:33,988
And now I sit between
misunderstood people.

684
01:20:34,122 --> 01:20:36,577
Can I ask you something, Adelle?

685
01:20:39,043 --> 01:20:43,705
Is it ever bother you that no one else in the moon
believe?

686
01:20:50,638 --> 01:20:55,384
Maybe the good is if I stay here just long enough.

687
01:21:01,357 --> 01:21:05,307
Adelle, you take those pills still in?

688
01:21:31,137 --> 01:21:33,545
I should just surrender.

689
01:21:34,641 --> 01:21:36,349
Emptying My spirit.

690
01:21:38,811 --> 01:21:40,638
Feel Nothing more.

691
01:21:42,732 --> 01:21:44,357
Go to sleep.

692
01:22:09,843 --> 01:22:11,502
That's better.

693
01:22:15,473 --> 01:22:20,265
It's time to get out of here.
Take a deep breath and then we go.

694
01:22:20,395 --> 01:22:21,853
I can not.

695
01:22:22,814 --> 01:22:27,025
Do not know what I did?
- I heard.

696
01:22:28,695 --> 01:22:32,775
Then you know so that I'm too sick to go.

697
01:22:34,576 --> 01:22:37,826
Maybe you were not sick enough.

698
01:22:37,954 --> 01:22:42,415
Maybe you need some poison...

699
01:22:42,542 --> 01:22:46,587
to be able to live without
death along with us.

700
01:22:51,426 --> 01:22:54,842
You have a rare power.

701
01:22:54,971 --> 01:22:58,138
It's not that you did not have power.

702
01:22:58,266 --> 01:23:03,936
But if you rise from the dead
verdriedubbel your strength...

703
01:23:04,063 --> 01:23:06,934
sometimes even quadrupled.

704
01:23:10,445 --> 01:23:14,941
You could use it here,
but it is too limited.

705
01:23:16,201 --> 01:23:19,201
That would be stingy.

706
01:23:23,791 --> 01:23:25,416
Go now but.

707
01:23:28,213 --> 01:23:30,252
Take your shoes.

708
01:23:31,841 --> 01:23:34,130
I'm going to talk to this girl.

709
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:20,919
If you do not say, I put you
silence, mister Kakentoe.

710
01:24:21,724 --> 01:24:25,722
I had you immediately have to beat up
when you came here.

711
01:24:25,854 --> 01:24:30,314
I should have overwhelmed
as an avalanche of shit.

712
01:24:32,235 --> 01:24:35,734
Carl, I'll talk about our marriage.

713
01:24:40,201 --> 01:24:41,826
It's over.

714
01:24:42,245 --> 01:24:44,451
I realize now too.

715
01:24:44,581 --> 01:24:47,914
I've tried.
Really tried.

716
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:52,958
But I do not go on.
I'll get over it.

717
01:24:53,089 --> 01:24:56,007
I may be someone who is committed.

718
01:24:56,509 --> 01:25:00,377
But I feel disconnected from you.

719
01:25:08,062 --> 01:25:14,397
You can delete tattoos.
It takes a long time and it hurts...

720
01:25:14,527 --> 01:25:19,236
but ultimately you are left with a white spot.

721
01:25:23,161 --> 01:25:26,281
Has T-Bo you done that?

722
01:25:26,414 --> 01:25:32,749
No, I'm out of a car cases.
- A moving car?

723
01:25:34,631 --> 01:25:40,550
It was a Jeep. I watched
not well and I fell out.

724
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:44,927
I hope it heals quickly.

725
01:25:48,269 --> 01:25:49,977
Goodbye, Carl.

726
01:26:26,182 --> 01:26:28,756
I'm still committed.

727
01:26:28,893 --> 01:26:34,314
I have talent for.
Some people just have that.

728
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:41,355
If you do not look up the extremes
how can you be absolutely sure?

729
01:26:42,198 --> 01:26:46,990
How do they know what they really
, or what they stand for?

730
01:26:49,038 --> 01:26:51,197
From El Paso?

731
01:26:51,332 --> 01:26:53,788
Or where others stand for?

732
01:26:58,298 --> 01:27:00,586
That remains a mystery.

733
01:27:17,567 --> 01:27:19,191
Beer?

734
01:27:44,928 --> 01:27:47,169
You have dogs, I see.

735
01:27:49,265 --> 01:27:51,305
Bill, Sheila, kitchen.

736
01:27:53,770 --> 01:27:58,266
I came back to pick up my shower radio.

737
01:27:58,399 --> 01:28:02,018
I have myself but admitted.

738
01:28:02,153 --> 01:28:04,905
Coming from El Paso purpose here?

739
01:28:05,031 --> 01:28:09,907
I do not live in El Paso,
I live in New York again.

740
01:28:10,036 --> 01:28:16,205
Everything came there one bit
a dead end, not only in terms of work.

741
01:28:16,334 --> 01:28:21,494
I had the feeling that I no longer knew who I was.

742
01:28:21,631 --> 01:28:24,122
I knew you knew it yet though.

743
01:28:24,259 --> 01:28:27,959
I had a wrong step put
in my life.

744
01:28:28,096 --> 01:28:32,094
I felt that I did something...

745
01:28:32,225 --> 01:28:36,009
why I came back.

746
01:28:37,105 --> 01:28:41,648
And I'm back again.

747
01:28:55,623 --> 01:29:00,618
It's just a reflex.
I sit today in karate.

748
01:29:00,753 --> 01:29:04,834
You can quite nice.
- You OK? Really?

749
01:29:04,966 --> 01:29:10,636
It felt good to me.
- Really? Fine.

750
01:29:10,763 --> 01:29:15,141
I just came by to see
or was okay with you.

751
01:29:15,268 --> 01:29:17,261
It's fine with me.

752
01:29:17,896 --> 01:29:22,771
See you then. Thank you.
I will give you back your key.

753
01:29:28,948 --> 01:29:31,190
Take care of yourself, Carl.

754
01:29:48,176 --> 01:29:52,256
Wholeheartedly.
- It was a beautiful ceremony.

755
01:29:56,851 --> 01:30:01,347
Joline, unbelievable
that you've caught the bouquet.

756
01:30:01,481 --> 01:30:05,265
You threw it right at me,
exactly in my eye.

757
01:30:05,401 --> 01:30:07,524
Sorry.
- Does not matter.

758
01:30:07,654 --> 01:30:12,031
I did because you have inspired us.

759
01:30:12,158 --> 01:30:16,405
We met at your campsite.

760
01:31:03,501 --> 01:31:07,285
I took champagne for you.
- Thank you.

761
01:31:09,924 --> 01:31:15,001
Did I mention that I
chocolate to have you in my car?

762
01:31:15,138 --> 01:31:17,130
And a poem.

763
01:31:17,265 --> 01:31:19,258
A poem?
- Right.

764
01:31:19,392 --> 01:31:22,975
I want to soon nominate you.

765
01:31:23,104 --> 01:31:29,771
You're not going to be obscene?
- No, of course not. Come on.

766
01:31:31,654 --> 01:31:34,441
But if you want, I do it, though.

767
01:31:34,574 --> 01:31:37,990
You can be quite persistent.

768
01:31:38,119 --> 01:31:40,740
As is worth...

769
01:31:42,540 --> 01:31:48,792
There are always people who dare
it to make a big jump.

770
01:31:48,922 --> 01:31:54,876
They jump off a cliff with all
what they have and hope 's best.

771
01:31:55,011 --> 01:31:57,336
What can you say about them?

772
01:31:57,472 --> 01:32:00,841
Are they stupid or brave?

773
01:32:01,809 --> 01:32:03,849
Are they crazy?

774
01:32:03,978 --> 01:32:08,640
Or they may themselves very lucky?

775
01:32:09,817 --> 01:32:14,278
That's again something you can see from both sides.

775
01:32:15,305 --> 01:32:21,254
