2
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:07,464
A disease caused by promiscuity.

3
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:10,468
A disease that Satan created.

4
00:01:10,536 --> 00:01:12,333
A disease that the Catholic Church...

5
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:15,465
...can not tolerate at any rate.

6
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:19,807
We are aware that
this is a serious problem.

7
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:24,077
A problem that Jesus
himself would have denounced.

8
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,313
It is our responsibility
as Christians to fight...

9
00:01:27,386 --> 00:01:29,320
this sexual promiscuity.

10
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,351
It is the responsibility
of each of us...

11
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:40,695
to stop the spread
of AIDS in our society.

12
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:42,961
We must not forgive...

13
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,801
The church has AIDS!

14
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,337
The church has AIDS!

15
00:01:46,405 --> 00:01:48,032
I have no voice in
this conference!

16
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:50,701
Our fellow priests are dying
and the Vatican does nothing!

17
00:01:50,776 --> 00:01:52,971
Open your eyes to
what's going on!

18
00:01:54,246 --> 00:01:56,976
Stop this shame
before it's too late!

19
00:01:57,049 --> 00:01:59,813
How many of you here
are HIV positive?!

20
00:01:59,885 --> 00:02:02,854
How many of you in this
room are HIV positive?!

21
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:04,617
I will not be silent!

22
00:02:05,691 --> 00:02:07,283
I will not be silent!

23
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,055
Priests are dying
in the hundreds.

24
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:10,857
I will not be silenced.

25
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,625
You can't hide it here!

26
00:02:12,698 --> 00:02:14,893
This issue can not be hid!

27
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:17,834
This issue can not be hidden,
the church has AIDS!

28
00:02:17,903 --> 00:02:19,894
The church has AIDS!

29

To the airport!

30
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,552
-Good afternoon, Father.
-Quiet moment.

31
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,495
I like to be here
on my own sometimes.

32
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,694
Father Doherty.

33
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,729
Daniel.

34
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:29,570
-Good weekend?
-Thank you, yes.

35
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:31,303
Tom.

36
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,742
Jack.

37
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,267
-Where have you been?
-Chapel.

38
00:04:03,342 --> 00:04:04,468
If you spend any more
time in that place...

39
00:04:04,543 --> 00:04:06,067
you may as well sleep
on the fuckin' alter.

40
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:09,379
-Dean's list up yet?
-No, no not yet.

41
00:04:09,448 --> 00:04:10,881
To God, Fitzpatrick's
not on it.

42
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:11,974
Or that other queer fella.

43
00:04:13,185 --> 00:04:15,016
Oh, come on now,
where's your compassion?

44
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:17,021
I haven't got any as far
as Ernie is concerned.

45
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,647
You know I don't like
that lucky bollocks.

46
00:04:18,724 --> 00:04:19,986
Oh, is this any good, Danny?

47
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:22,152
Brilliant, half-way
through it already.

48
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:23,991
We better read it
before he gets here.

49
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:25,553
I hope he's better
than the last fella.

50
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:26,996
A wee bit shorter too.

51
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,863
Holy Mary, my ass is killin' me
by the finish.

52
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:31,528
Oh well, we must suffer
for our faith boys.

53
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,071
We must shite!

54
00:04:48,754 --> 00:04:49,686
Come on, find your man!

55
00:04:49,755 --> 00:04:51,655
The biggest danger is that
center forward they've got.

56
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,157
If we can stop him
we're in with a chance.

57
00:04:53,225 --> 00:04:53,748
He toss?

58
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:57,257
-Apart from him.
-What's wrong with him?

59
00:04:57,329 --> 00:04:59,456
The best this place has seen
in a long time.

60
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:01,932
-That can be the fittest look.
-He's keen to play.

61
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:05,198
Looking at you again, Danny.

62
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:07,432
No, he's not.
He might be lookin' at you!

63
00:05:07,506 --> 00:05:09,337
You never know he might come knockin
at your door at midnight...

64
00:05:09,408 --> 00:05:10,875
with two cups of cocoa
and a hot water bottle.

65
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:12,342
-Bollocks!
-Them as well.

66
00:05:12,411 --> 00:05:14,276
No, you don't have long to go
till your ordination,

67
00:05:14,346 --> 00:05:15,278
don't throw it away now.

68
00:05:15,347 --> 00:05:16,814
The long winter nights
will soon be on us.

69
00:05:16,882 --> 00:05:19,715
-What's a fella to do?
-Do what the rest of us do.

70
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:40,733
It's a good team, Paul.
We should do well.

71
00:05:40,806 --> 00:05:42,774
This could become Galcranagh
year to win the league.

72
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,139
Yes.

73
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,678
Especially with a
little help from him.

74
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:51,114
Yes!

75
00:05:51,183 --> 00:05:52,172
Me too!

76
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:53,479
We thought you'd be
good for the team.

77
00:05:53,552 --> 00:05:54,712
Oh, we will be!

78
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,186
I've been looking
forward to this, thanks!

79
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:57,313
Yeah, thanks.

80
00:05:57,389 --> 00:05:58,583
No problem.

81
00:05:58,657 --> 00:06:00,386
We need all the talent
we can get.

82
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:02,723
See you tomorrow lads,
get plenty of sleep.

83
00:06:06,832 --> 00:06:08,299
That fella gives me
the jitters, Danny.

84
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,631
Don't be stupid, best captain
this town's ever had.

85
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,728
Fair enough. Hey, are you
going to the dance?

86
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,067
Yea...

87
00:07:07,192 --> 00:07:08,124
Go on Danny!

88
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:14,221
At last!
Yes!

89

-Cheers, lads!
-Cheers!!

93

-Whew!
-Fair play, chaps!

94
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:01,067
-Stop talking business.
-Meet my sister.

95
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,904
-Hello, Dublin.
-Nice to meet you.

96
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:05,774

How's it going Daniel?

100
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:30,897
I hear you won today,
congratulations.

101
00:09:30,969 --> 00:09:32,197
-Were the man of the match?
-Hardly.

102
00:09:32,704 --> 00:09:34,171
How are you Decklin?

103
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:35,968
See your woman over there?

104
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:36,939
Which o ne?

105
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:40,069
-The one with the big jugs.
-They've all got big jugs.

106
00:09:40,145 --> 00:09:43,342
The one in the pink top,
anytime you want a ride...

107
00:09:43,415 --> 00:09:46,646
she'll be happy to oblige.
She loves fucking priests.

108
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:01,724
Hasn't been out with any one else
since you joined the priesthood.

109
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,234
You broke her heart.

110
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:06,965
God had other plans for me.

111
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:11,601
Sure has, Daniel.
Sure has.

112
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,167
Enjoy yourself.

On my way, Ma thanks.

115
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,541
Be back at the weekend Daniel?

116
00:13:00,612 --> 00:13:01,579
Yeah.

117
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,945

-See you, Ma.

Fred, Fred, what's happened?

123
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,578
Jesus, Foley, you must know
someone in the Archon.

124
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,553
How the hell did you
find out so quick?

125
00:14:16,621 --> 00:14:17,986
I got a message
from Father Sweeney.

126
00:14:18,056 --> 00:14:19,887
He told me there's a story
I might be interested in.

127
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,892
Poor bastard
splattered himself.

128
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,927
Who?

129
00:14:22,994 --> 00:14:25,462
Father Sweeney.
Suicide.

130
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:28,263
Big time.

131
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:30,227
God's police,
you'd better fuck off,

132
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:31,826
this is private property.

133
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:36,037
David Foley,
Galcranagh Gazette...

134
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:37,769
any chance I can ask you
a few questions?

135
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:38,775
No!

136
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:45,940
Bishop, can I ask you a few
questions about Father Sweeney.

137
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:48,950
Got any comments
to make whatsoever?

138
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,214
Please, just a few moments
of your time, that's all...

139
00:14:50,288 --> 00:14:51,448
Foley, now, that's enough!

140
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:53,952
Foley!

141
00:14:54,025 --> 00:14:55,788
Can I ask you
a few questions?

142
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:58,295
Please just a few
moments of your time.

143
00:14:58,363 --> 00:15:00,797
I'll be wanting a statement
from you, Foley.

144
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:04,461
-I'm very sorry about that...
-Okay, okay.

145
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,731
<i>Right if your ready</i>
<i>we'll go inside now.</i>

On the general level of
academic work this year so far,

149
00:15:14,946 --> 00:15:16,607
has been exceptional.

150
00:15:16,681 --> 00:15:19,650
The teaching staff tell me
you've all worked very hard.

151
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:22,744
This coming week sees a visit
of Father Joseph Venice...

152
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,982
from the Jesuit order
who will be giving a lecture.

153
00:15:25,056 --> 00:15:26,887
And for those of you
who haven't heard him yet,

154
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,448
you've got a treat in store.

155
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,518
His talk will be based
on his best selling book;

156
00:15:30,595 --> 00:15:32,187
<i>The Longer Road.</i>

157
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:35,358
Now, I wouldn't like
to let this morning pass...

158
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,800
without congratulating our hurlers...

159
00:15:37,869 --> 00:15:40,235

160
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:43,964
Well done, boys.
Keep up the good work.

161
00:15:46,411 --> 00:15:49,073
Well done yesterday, you did
a great job for your first game.

162
00:15:49,147 --> 00:15:50,739
Thanks for giving me the chance.

163
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:52,408
Last night was good,
wasn't it?

164
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:53,473
They were deadly.

165
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:55,144
-They were great!
-Yeah.

166
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,053
Father Dowling tells me
you're way ahead of your year.

167
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,351
How did you know about that?

168
00:15:59,424 --> 00:16:02,086
Look, I'm having a few people
over to my room tonight,

169
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,220
we're going to take a look at Saint
Paul's letters to the Thessalonians.

170
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,355
I wonder if you'd like
to join us?

171
00:16:06,431 --> 00:16:07,420
I've got some work to do,

172
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,091
I suppose a couple of hours
won't hurt.

173
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:10,964
-Yeah, allright.
-All right?

174
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:12,162
See you.

175
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:00,808
I'm so sorry Matthew.

176
00:17:03,054 --> 00:17:06,387
-Been up to the house?
-No, no, have you?

177
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,325
Yeah, they wouldn't let me in.

178
00:17:13,231 --> 00:17:15,631
They said it was suicide.

179
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,395
You sure?

180
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:19,027
Did he leave a note?

181
00:17:20,772 --> 00:17:22,034
I don't know.

182
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,203
I don't know.

183
00:17:31,182 --> 00:17:33,514
Why didn't he talk to me?

184
00:17:37,255 --> 00:17:40,122
It's just such a waste!

185
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,828
It's such a terrible waste!

186
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:09,811
Galcranagh Gazette.

187
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:10,877
Anyone call?

188
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:12,583
O'Brien wants a word with you.

189
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:16,323
I heard your message Davey.
What happened?

190
00:18:16,394 --> 00:18:18,589
That priest who phoned me,
Father Sweeney,

191
00:18:18,663 --> 00:18:20,927
Parish of Dandur,
shot himself.

192
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,899
Shot himself, suicide.

193
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:24,230
Looks like it.

194
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,363
-Do we know why?
-Not yet, I'm working on it.

195
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,137
Liz was looking for you.

196
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,506
Yeah, I know, I was supposed
to take Martha to school.

197
00:18:32,577 --> 00:18:34,670
Ah, get her some flowers.

198
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,680
She'll throw them at me!

199
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:38,977
Galcranagh Gazette.

200
00:18:42,587 --> 00:18:44,111
No way,
I don't believe you.

201
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:45,588
I'm telling you, it's true!

202
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:47,591
Father Doherty
drank the eye bath?

203
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:50,253
-Yeah, he swallowed it down in one.
-What did the doctor say?

204
00:18:50,328 --> 00:18:53,764
She was just after telling him
to take one of these three times a day.

205
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:55,197
The eyes nearly popped
out of her head.

206
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:57,097
She goes, "No, you're supposed
to bathe your eye in it,

207
00:18:57,168 --> 00:18:58,430
not freakin drink it!

208
00:19:00,171 --> 00:19:01,103
He thought it was booze,

209
00:19:01,172 --> 00:19:02,298
it's a wonder
he didn't poison himself.

210
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:05,934
You been telling
jokes again Daniel?

211
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:33,394
Look, I'm sorry lads, I'm going to
have to postpone the class...

212
00:19:33,471 --> 00:19:35,530
for an hour or so.
I hope that's okay.

213
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:38,907
Be back as soon as I can.

214
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,679
Hello,
Galcranagh Gazette.

215
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,787
Who's speaking?

216
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,853
Call for you, Davey.

217
00:19:56,761 --> 00:19:57,728
Foley.

218
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:00,196
<i>-David, it's Jack Dowling.</i>
-Hi, Jack.

219
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,699
<i>Listen I've got to be quick cause</i>
<i>I'm calling from the seminary.</i>

220
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:03,597
Mhmm.

221
00:20:03,668 --> 00:20:05,465
<i>I need to talk to you</i>
<i>about Father Sweeney.</i>

222
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,801
-Are you okay Jack?
<i>-Yes, I'm fine.</i>

223
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:27,052
Paul couldn't come, too much work.
It's unusual for him.

224
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:30,822
But I don't know where the others are.
They should be here by now.

225
00:20:34,432 --> 00:20:35,694
I'm looking forward to
Father Joseph coming,

226
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:36,563
I've heard so much about him.

227
00:20:36,634 --> 00:20:38,693
He's great.
Have you read his book yet?

228
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,067
How do you find the time?

229
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:44,006
Study, community service,
hurling captain.

230
00:20:44,075 --> 00:20:46,543
This is nothing compared to what
it will be like working in parish.

231
00:20:46,611 --> 00:20:48,169
Aye, you'll be there
this time next year.

232
00:20:48,246 --> 00:20:49,042
Can't wait!

233
00:21:06,097 --> 00:21:08,065
-It's okay.
-Not for me it isn't.

234
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:12,934
C'mon, we all need someone.
We're all human.

235
00:21:13,004 --> 00:21:14,665
And we're also
called to God!

236
00:21:14,739 --> 00:21:16,832
You made a promise
Noel, we all did.

237
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:19,001
And you're going to keep that
promise for the rest of your life?

238
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:20,908
Yeah!

239
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:23,174
Look, it doesn't matter
to me what you are,

240
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:24,510
that's up to you.

241
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:29,280
-I better go.
-Don't go.

242
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:31,754
-I'm going.
-You don't have to.

243
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:33,484
I won't say a word.

244
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:35,458
For fuck's sake Noel.

245
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:37,290
Just leave me alone.

246
00:22:28,112 --> 00:22:29,101
What have you got Davey?

247
00:22:30,281 --> 00:22:31,908
Frank Sweeney had HIV.

248
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:33,211
What?

249
00:22:33,284 --> 00:22:34,615
And when the church
found out about it...

250
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,847
they threatened to kick him out
and leave him to fend for himself.

251
00:22:36,921 --> 00:22:38,946
He was so distressed at the
thought of losing his own parish...

252
00:22:39,023 --> 00:22:40,251
that he killed himself.

253
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:43,317
Poor bastard.
So who's the boyfriend?

254
00:22:43,394 --> 00:22:45,555
Don't know yet,
the rumor has it,

255
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,188
it's somebody high
up in the church.

256
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:49,324
Who?
The pope!

257
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,359
I'm seeing Father Francis, he should
shed some light on the proceedings.

258
00:23:03,147 --> 00:23:04,842
Your work is good Daniel.

259
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:09,784
And you're well liked.

260
00:23:11,756 --> 00:23:14,316
But unfortunately I have
no choice in the matter.

261
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:16,860
What do you mean father?
I don't understand.

262
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:18,225
You have to leave.

263
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,021
What?

264
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:22,157
God and your conscience
spoke for you Daniel,

265
00:23:22,233 --> 00:23:23,791
that's why you went
to Father Doherty.

266
00:23:23,868 --> 00:23:25,130
I didn't go to
Father Doherty,

267
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:27,694
I just bumped into him.
What are you talking about?

268
00:23:27,772 --> 00:23:29,330
He saw you leave
Noel's room.

269
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:32,342
I don't believe this, what you're
saying is I'm guilty by association.

270
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,470
No, what I'm saying
is you know the rules.

271
00:23:35,546 --> 00:23:37,844
Students are not allowed to
be alone together at night.

272
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,315
I don't believe this!

273
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:41,477
Nothing happened
in Noel's room.

274
00:23:41,552 --> 00:23:45,318
Look, take a year or two off,
see how you feel then.

275
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,982
I know how I feel now.

276
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:50,858
I want to be a priest.
I've always wanted to be a priest.

277
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:54,695
-You're not ready.
-You can't do this to me.

278
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,326
-I have rights!
-Not here you don't.

279
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:02,635
Pack your things and go.

280
00:24:30,301 --> 00:24:31,700
What the hell are you doing!

281
00:24:31,769 --> 00:24:33,396
What did you say
to Cathal?

282
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:35,996
I didn't, I saw you come
out of his room.

283
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:38,338
Nothing happened in Noel's room
you stupid man!

284
00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:39,740
We're just doing
what's right.

285
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,438
You have a fucking warped
idea of what's right and wrong!

286
00:24:41,512 --> 00:24:42,638
Let him go!

287
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:48,541
You're sick!

288
00:24:58,296 --> 00:24:59,695
What the hell did you
tell you Cathal for?

289
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:00,924
I didn't, okay?

290
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,229
This is Doherty's doing, he's
nothin' more than a fucking drunk.

291
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:04,427
What exactly did you tell him!

292
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:05,594
He saw me coming
out of your room.

293
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,659
But nothing happened!

294
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:08,763
I know, that's what
I told Cathal.

295
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,640
-This will kill my mother.
-They can't do this to us.

296
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,802
They just have.

297
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:17,114
Oh dear God, Daniel!
What have you done?

298
00:25:17,181 --> 00:25:18,648
Nothing mom, I swear to God.

299
00:25:18,716 --> 00:25:19,740
You must have done something!

300
00:25:19,817 --> 00:25:21,114
I told you,
I've done nothing!

301
00:25:21,185 --> 00:25:22,311
What are people going to say!

302
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:24,480
Fucking hell,
this is my life!

303
00:25:24,555 --> 00:25:25,852
Don't you swear
at your mother!

304
00:25:25,923 --> 00:25:28,892
-I wasn't swearing at her.
-It's not just your life.

305
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,655
You being thrown
out of that seminary effects...

306
00:25:30,728 --> 00:25:33,162
everybody's life in this house,
do you realize that?

307
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:35,529
I mean your father and I had a son
we thought was going to be priest,

308
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,999
now we have a son
who's on the doles!

309
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:38,592
What about our Euro grant?

310
00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:40,864
I went to see
those bastards today.

311
00:25:40,938 --> 00:25:43,065
That father Cathal is on
the selection board,

312
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:44,608
what the fuck is he
going to think!

313
00:25:45,843 --> 00:25:46,775
They're two of
our brightest...

314
00:25:46,844 --> 00:25:47,902
That is not the issue!

315
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:49,742
Okay then, what is!
The boys did nothing.

316
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:51,338
That might be so, but we can't
have this sort of thing...

317
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:52,610
going on in the seminary!

318
00:25:52,683 --> 00:25:53,809
I don't believe
what I'm hearing.

319
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,512
Noel Kinahan approached
Daniel McLaughlin.

320
00:25:55,586 --> 00:25:57,349
Daniel said no and now
both their lives are ruined,

321
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:58,286
how can that be right?

322
00:25:58,356 --> 00:25:59,516
It's not a question of
what's right or wrong,

323
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,887
it's a question of
what's acceptable here,

324
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:02,220
and that's not acceptable.

325
00:26:02,293 --> 00:26:03,453
There's nothing more to say,
it's time you left.

326
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:05,359
You can't keep
pushing this aside.

327
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,399
Priests can't deny their
sexuality, gay or otherwise.

328
00:26:10,868 --> 00:26:13,098
You made the sacred
promise of celibacy,

329
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:15,105
I don't see you breaking it.

330
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:17,664
It's being broken every day,
all over the world.

331
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:18,970
No, not blatantly it isn't.

332
00:26:19,043 --> 00:26:20,704
Oh, so as long is it's behind
closed doors it's all right.

333
00:26:20,778 --> 00:26:22,939
Noel Kinahan
and Daniel McLaughlin...

334
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:24,345
are out of here
and that's the end of it.

335
00:26:24,415 --> 00:26:25,746
But the likes of
Noel and Daniel...

336
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:27,114
are the life blood of the church.

337
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:28,152
They are the future.

338
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:30,244
When I came here there were
nearly 50 seminarians,

339
00:26:30,321 --> 00:26:31,811
the place had life!

340
00:26:31,889 --> 00:26:34,881
Five years later look at it,
it's almost empty, it's dead.

341
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:37,393
The church must evolve, we can't
live with celibacy any longer,

342
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:38,224
it's killing us!

343
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:40,992
I forbid you to voice
your opinion here.

344
00:26:41,065 --> 00:26:43,192
You're here to teach
Christ's message.

345
00:26:43,267 --> 00:26:45,462
-Christ died for change.
-Enough Jack!

346
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:47,803
Enough.

347
00:26:57,882 --> 00:26:59,315
My decision has been made.

348
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:19,303
It's good Davey,

349
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:21,804
as usual but you're going to get
yourself into trouble...

350
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:24,273
...if you're not careful.
You always do this.

351
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:27,269
You know I reckon
there's more to come.

352
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:30,212
I think Sweeney didn't kill himself
solely because he was HIV.

353
00:27:30,848 --> 00:27:31,940
The guy had it
for five years.

354
00:27:32,016 --> 00:27:33,074
Oh, God.

355
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,482
Oh, come on, try
and understand,

356
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:35,917
it's a good
opportunity for me.

357
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,648
Understand what?

358
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:40,657
That you're never home, that
you never see your daughter?

359
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:43,319
You're missing out on the
most important time of her life.

360
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,960
This won't happen again,
once it's gone, it's gone...

361
00:27:47,031 --> 00:27:48,862
and in ten years time you'll
have a teenage daughter...

362
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:50,924
on your hands
that you won't even know.

363
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:54,335
But I'm doing it for her,
I'm doing it for you.

364
00:27:54,405 --> 00:27:56,464
Oh, Bollocks. You're doing it
for David Foley.

365
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,871
No, I suggest that
you do it now.

366
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:06,608
You know this could
get out of hand.

367
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:08,151
It's too late
to stop it now.

368
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:09,709
I don't think there's
anything to worry about,

369
00:28:09,787 --> 00:28:10,947
it's only a local story.

370
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:14,116
Ah, yes, local, until the
national press pick up on it.

371
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,489
I think we should
let it run it course,

372
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,584
it will fade away.

373
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:18,288
Maybe it won't fade away.

374
00:28:18,362 --> 00:28:20,660
This Foley character
wants to make his name.

375
00:28:20,731 --> 00:28:23,222
Find out who else
he's been talking to.

376
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:25,064
I have a bad feeling about this,

377
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:26,467
it's here in
black and white.

378
00:28:26,537 --> 00:28:30,633
"Local priest ostracized,
HIV, no suicide note."

379
00:28:31,475 --> 00:28:33,568
We should let
Rome deal with it.

380
00:28:33,644 --> 00:28:36,238
God will protect us,
Father Hennesey...

381
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:39,147
just as we have a duty
to protect his church.

382
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,242
Oppression never works.

383
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:44,049
Sometimes we have no choice.

384
00:28:47,558 --> 00:28:49,423
-How are things with you and dad?
-Same.

385
00:28:49,493 --> 00:28:52,018
Never had a decent conversation
with me in his whole life.

386
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,290
Sure, you know what he's like.

387
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,528
It's a long time since
we were up here together.

388
00:28:58,603 --> 00:28:59,365
Years.

389
00:29:01,138 --> 00:29:03,299
Just remember I told you
I was going to be a priest,

390
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:05,069
and you said you were
going to be a pilot.

391
00:29:05,142 --> 00:29:09,340
Oh, pilot, Jesus, at least
you got closer than me.

392
00:29:09,413 --> 00:29:10,345
Not yet I haven't.

393
00:29:10,414 --> 00:29:13,508
-What are you going to do?
-I don't know.

394
00:29:13,584 --> 00:29:14,448
I went to see Father Doherty,

395
00:29:14,518 --> 00:29:15,815
he wants me to talk to Foley.

396
00:29:15,886 --> 00:29:16,853
-That cunt?
-Every one is to you.

397
00:29:18,956 --> 00:29:20,082
Foley's all right.

398
00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:26,191
You scared?

399
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:30,894
No, God's on my side,
he knows what happened.

400
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:36,071
What about you? You've
got to get out of here.

401
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:39,603
I will.

402
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:49,745
Tell me, you didn't
do anything did you?

403
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,720
With that queer fella?

404
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:54,758
You cheeky little bollocks!
Come on!

405
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,186
Last one down's a poof!

406
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,164
Oh, shit.

407
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,261
Have they let you out Daniel?

408
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:08,066
A few days off Mrs. McGlynn,
community study.

409
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,767
You were made for the
priesthood Daniel.

410
00:30:10,841 --> 00:30:13,207
I saw that in you
when you were only this high.

411
00:30:13,277 --> 00:30:15,472
The way you help people and all.

412
00:30:15,546 --> 00:30:18,947
I was told you had a fight
with one of the main fellas...

413
00:30:19,016 --> 00:30:22,110
up at the seminary there,
and that he'd thrown you out.

414
00:30:22,186 --> 00:30:25,087
There wouldn't be any truth
in that now would there, Daniel?

415
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:28,182
Oh, about the same amount of truth
in the rumor about the pope.

416
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:29,624
What's that?

417
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:31,719
He's married and has four kids
with a black lesbian.

418
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:35,626
God forgive you!

419
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,294
You devil you, you'll
bring bad luck on us all!

420
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:39,734
See you later Mrs. McGlynn.

421
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,175
You knew Frank Sweeney, Jack.

422
00:30:55,252 --> 00:30:56,514
Yes.

423
00:30:56,587 --> 00:30:58,350
He was ill.

424
00:30:58,422 --> 00:30:59,684
Yeah.

425
00:31:01,592 --> 00:31:04,186
He was struck down by God
for what he was up to.

426
00:31:04,261 --> 00:31:06,388
My God isn't vengeful.

427
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:11,795
Did you talk to the
press about this?

428
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:15,072
-No.
-I hope not, Father.

429
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:18,006
This is an internal matter
for the church to deal with...

430
00:31:18,075 --> 00:31:20,270
and as diocesan
communications officer,

431
00:31:20,344 --> 00:31:22,278
that's my job.

432
00:31:22,346 --> 00:31:24,780
We don't appear to be
dealing with it very well.

433
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:27,443
Sweeney and his like are
sinners in the eyes of God.

434
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:30,351
We have a duty to protect his
kingdom and to root out evil...

435
00:31:31,922 --> 00:31:33,150
...wherever it be found.

436
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:36,919
So what you going to do about Sinead,
you gonna call her then?

437
00:31:36,994 --> 00:31:38,188
Don't think so.

438
00:31:38,262 --> 00:31:40,594
Come on, she's still
crazy about you.

439
00:31:40,664 --> 00:31:42,393
I have enough on my
plate at the moment.

440
00:31:42,466 --> 00:31:43,899
Go on, go on!

441
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,136
What's the matter with you two?

442
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:53,836
We're worried sick,
that's what's wrong with us.

443
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:54,935
Any tea?

444
00:31:55,012 --> 00:31:56,946
That's all your good for
is drinking tea.

445
00:31:57,014 --> 00:31:59,346
Why don't you go
and find some work!

446
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,317
Do something useful
with yourself for a change.

447
00:32:01,385 --> 00:32:02,181
Dad!

448
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:07,020
So Daniel, tell us, what's
going to happen now, hmm?

449
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,059
What is going to happen now...

450
00:32:09,126 --> 00:32:10,753
that you're not going
to be a priest anymore?

451
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:11,920
That's not decided yet.

452
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:13,293
He's nothing but
a useless bastard!

453
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:15,264
Fuck off!
I've had enough!

454
00:32:15,332 --> 00:32:17,197
Don't you fuckin' talk to me
like that you little bollocks!

455
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,132
Sean!

456
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:21,537
Looking for a good hiding!

457
00:32:21,605 --> 00:32:23,800
You started all of this
you know!

458
00:32:23,874 --> 00:32:24,966
What are you
talking about ma?

459
00:32:25,042 --> 00:32:26,168
This has nothing
to do with me!

460
00:32:26,243 --> 00:32:28,302
It has everything
to do with you.

461
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:29,744
I'll be going back
to the seminary.

462
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:31,213
You'd better be!

463
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,443
Or I go and see that
Cathal fella myself.

464
00:32:55,539 --> 00:32:58,099
-Good morning every one.
-Good morning Father.

465
00:32:58,175 --> 00:33:01,144
Welcome to Saint Saviors
Seminary here in Galcranagh.

466
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:03,146
I'd just like to apologize
for the late start.

467
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:05,910
There are some things,
even we as men of God...

468
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:07,382
don't have control over.

469
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,714
I'd also like to
welcome our special guests,

470
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:13,222
and in particular to extend
a very warm welcome...

471
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:15,850
to his Lordship,
Bishop Michael Quinn.

472
00:33:16,727 --> 00:33:18,661
This is a special day.

473
00:33:18,729 --> 00:33:22,028
A day when we can welcome back
an old friend,

474
00:33:22,099 --> 00:33:25,694
a man who has traveled as
much as, if not more than,

475
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:27,259
Saint Paul himself.

476
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:30,432
So without further adieu,
would you please welcome...

477
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,442
Father Joseph Venice.

478
00:33:40,751 --> 00:33:43,584
Thank you, Father Cathal.
Good morning every one.

479
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:45,212
-Good morning, Father.
-Bishop.

480
00:33:45,489 --> 00:33:47,116
It's good to be back.

481
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,318
And it was worth the four hour
delay in Rome...

482
00:33:49,393 --> 00:33:51,691
just to hear myself
compared to Saint Paul.

483
00:33:52,796 --> 00:33:55,321
For the past two years
I've been working with a...

484
00:33:55,399 --> 00:33:57,162
United Nations committee.

485
00:33:57,234 --> 00:33:59,725
We visited some of the
world's poorest countries,

486
00:33:59,803 --> 00:34:02,363
countries which we in the west
have described as

487
00:34:02,439 --> 00:34:05,067
developing, or even
underdeveloped.

488
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:07,608
But...

489
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:11,007
If I'm honest.

490
00:34:12,249 --> 00:34:14,740
And I hope you think I am,

491
00:34:14,818 --> 00:34:21,018
then I have to tell you that
the moral sophistication...

492
00:34:21,091 --> 00:34:23,616
that I encountered in some
of these countries...

493
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:27,790
makes us in the west seem
shamefully underdeveloped.

494
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:32,768
-Welcome.
-Thank you, sorry I'm late.

495
00:34:32,836 --> 00:34:34,394
My talk's about morality.

496
00:34:34,471 --> 00:34:36,405
-Good subject.
-I think so.

497
00:34:36,473 --> 00:34:39,874
And in particular,
how morality,

498
00:34:39,944 --> 00:34:42,640
how Christian morality
fits into an increasingly...

499
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:45,910
skeptical world in which
morality is in decline.

500
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:46,779
You have to leave.

501
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:48,374
Why?
Don't touch me!

502
00:34:49,486 --> 00:34:51,681
Please forgive the interruption
ladies and gentlemen.

503
00:34:51,755 --> 00:34:53,916
If you'd like to wait
in my office Daniel,

504
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:55,481
we'll deal with this later.

505
00:34:55,559 --> 00:34:56,685
Deal with what exactly?

506
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,284
This is not the time
or the place.

507
00:34:58,362 --> 00:34:59,727
Please father, conti nue.

508
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:01,230
What better a time
or place, Father...

509
00:35:01,298 --> 00:35:02,697
than when we're discussing
morality?

510
00:35:02,766 --> 00:35:04,631
This is unfair to
Father Joseph, Daniel.

511
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:07,535
-He's come a long way.
-Let the boy talk, Emil.

512
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:08,333
Don't make it worse.

513
00:35:08,405 --> 00:35:10,134
Get off me!
I've a right to be here...

514
00:35:10,207 --> 00:35:12,607
just as much as anyone else,
I've done nothing wrong!

515
00:35:12,676 --> 00:35:14,576
He deserves to have his say.

516
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:15,737
Get off me!

517
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,739
Let's hear what you
have to say Daniel.

518
00:35:25,956 --> 00:35:26,513
Stay here.

519
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,353
Father Cathal has thrown me
out of the seminary...

520
00:35:32,429 --> 00:35:36,160
because a priest, that priest
made an assumption about...

521
00:35:36,233 --> 00:35:38,394
-my relationship with another student...
-That's not true!

522
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:41,461
...who was also kicked out not far
from ordination, and that too is wrong.

523
00:35:41,538 --> 00:35:43,335
Not for you to say what's
right or wrong here,

524
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:44,738
that's my responsibility.

525
00:35:44,808 --> 00:35:47,208
It's a collective responsibility,
we weren't consulted.

526
00:35:47,277 --> 00:35:48,608
Look, you overreacted.

527
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,647
Don't you tell me what
I did or didn't do.

528
00:35:50,714 --> 00:35:51,976
What are you going to do now?

529
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:54,574
Dismiss me for a second time
in front of all of these people?

530
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:31,420
Get your house in order.

531
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:40,924
I don't know what to do anymore.

532
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:44,331
Sometimes I can't see
the point in going on.

533
00:36:44,401 --> 00:36:46,995
Come on Jack,
we all go through this.

534
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:52,099
The dark night of the soul and all that.
It's a test of our faith.

535
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:57,773
It's not my faith in God I'm losing,
it's the organization.

536
00:36:57,848 --> 00:37:03,218
The hypocrisy... the hierarchy,
the double standards.

537
00:37:05,989 --> 00:37:07,980
It took courage to do
what you did today.

538
00:37:08,058 --> 00:37:11,118
Thanks, but I don't think
it's done me any good.

539
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:12,719
It will in the long run.

540
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:17,895
Daniel, I think you
should talk again...

541
00:37:17,968 --> 00:37:19,162
to that journalist
that you mentioned.

542
00:37:19,236 --> 00:37:20,703
Let him print your story.

543
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:23,001
You are the new generation
of the priesthood.

544
00:37:23,073 --> 00:37:25,064
You have a voice,
let it be heard.

545
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:31,276
Jack, what's the matter.

546
00:37:31,348 --> 00:37:33,816
I was the one who spoke to
Foley about Frank's death.

547
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:36,148
Told him what I knew.

548
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,017
You do have freedom of
speech here in Ireland,

549
00:37:38,088 --> 00:37:40,056
as far as I know.

550
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:43,059
I lied to Father Cathal,
told him I hadn't.

551
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:49,723
Three our fathers and
two bloody mary's.

552
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:54,937
Daniel,
what do you say?

553
00:38:01,111 --> 00:38:02,635
She's going to get you,
she's going to get you,

554
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:03,771
she's going to get you,
she's going to get you!

555
00:38:03,847 --> 00:38:05,439
Oh... she got you!

556
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:13,515
You must be Francis.
David Foley.

557
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:15,251
-Good to meet you.
-You too.

558
00:38:15,325 --> 00:38:18,089
This is my wife, Liz and
this is my daughter, Martha.

559
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:19,060
Hello.

560
00:38:19,129 --> 00:38:20,357
-Hi.
-Hello.

561
00:38:21,431 --> 00:38:23,899
Uh, is this a good time?

562
00:38:23,967 --> 00:38:25,093
-Yes.
-No.

563
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:27,797
-I want some ice cream.
-Come on then let's go.

564
00:38:27,871 --> 00:38:31,238
-We're going home David.
-Oh, come on Liz.

565
00:38:31,308 --> 00:38:32,639
Liz!

566
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,007
Terribly sorry about that.

567
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:40,917
Thanks for meeting me
at such short notice.

568
00:38:40,984 --> 00:38:42,645
No problem.

569
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:44,209
I really liked your article.

570
00:38:46,089 --> 00:38:49,217
It's very sad.
I'm so sorry.

571
00:38:49,293 --> 00:38:52,194
You were good friends with
Frank Sweeney then, yeah?

572
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:56,925
Yeah, we trained together in
the Irish College in Rome.

573
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,524
You know there's a
rumor going around...

574
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:01,127
that Frank was having an affair
with somebody high up in Rome.

575
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:02,638
Do you know
anything about it?

576
00:39:02,706 --> 00:39:03,832
No.

577
00:39:03,907 --> 00:39:05,169
Are you sure?

578
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:08,643
Yeah, because I was
Frank's partner.

579
00:39:08,712 --> 00:39:09,974
You?

580
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:13,505
Yeah, it started out
just before we left Rome.

581
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:15,279
Does anybody else
know about this?

582
00:39:15,352 --> 00:39:19,482
Wel I... they know everything,
but no, not officially.

583
00:39:19,556 --> 00:39:21,251
Except for Jack Dowling.

584
00:39:25,829 --> 00:39:28,263
Would you be prepared to talk
about this on the record?

585
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:36,266
<i># In my hands, you might see... #</i>

586
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:46,477
<i># something special</i>
<i>that he gave to me. #</i>

587
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:52,847
<i># In my hand, yeah... #</i>

588
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:55,551
They're nothing but a
bunch of queers anyway.

589
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:58,561
God forgive you Marie,
don't say that about those holy men.

590
00:39:58,629 --> 00:39:59,960
Oh, where have you been!

591
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,055
They're men aren't they,
they're all the same.

592
00:40:02,132 --> 00:40:02,723
Yup!

593
00:40:02,799 --> 00:40:05,734
-If you can't pop the pink pop the prune.
-Whoa!

594
00:40:05,802 --> 00:40:07,667
That's disgusting!

595
00:40:08,772 --> 00:40:10,330
-So are they.
-That's not true.

596
00:40:10,407 --> 00:40:11,738
You're better off
out of it Daniel.

597
00:40:11,808 --> 00:40:15,005
All that freakin
studying ain't worth it.

598
00:40:15,078 --> 00:40:18,275
-It's my life Marie.
-Not anymore it isn't.

599
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:25,750
Let's get more drink.

600
00:40:25,822 --> 00:40:27,790
-Daniel?
-Pint.

601
00:40:29,459 --> 00:40:30,517
I'll have a whiskey.

602
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,129
-Hi.
-Hi.

603
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:39,432
Fancy seeing you here.

604
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,801
I'm sorry I haven't been in contact.

605
00:40:47,277 --> 00:40:48,437
I thought it was best.

606
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:50,946
I know,
it's good to see you.

607
00:40:53,283 --> 00:40:54,341
You too.

608
00:40:55,886 --> 00:41:00,914
I heard about the seminary,
what's going to happen?

609
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:02,891
Don't know.

610
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,951
You going back?

611
00:41:05,028 --> 00:41:07,189
I don't know.

612
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:09,357
I hear you're
out of the fortress, Daniel.

613
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:11,958
For the time being,
yeah, who told you?

614
00:41:12,035 --> 00:41:16,028
Small town, it was probably
that whore in McGlynn.

615
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:18,768
-What you having, Sean?
-Whiskey.

616
00:41:20,243 --> 00:41:22,939
-Are you buying Marie?
-Not for you turtle.

617
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:24,708
Ah, what's that
supposed to mean.

618
00:41:24,781 --> 00:41:26,248
Away and fuck yourself.

619
00:41:26,316 --> 00:41:28,682
He couldn't if he wanted to
from what I've heard.

620
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:29,776
No prick.

621
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:33,086
Aye, sure, you two'd know all
about pricks, wouldn't you?

622
00:41:33,156 --> 00:41:34,282
What the fuck
d'you mean by that!

623
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:36,792
You've had more between you
than a second hand dartboard.

624
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:42,630
Fuck off home to your wife and
small one, you fucking shite!

625
00:41:42,699 --> 00:41:45,634
Look who's talking...
the new tailbike.

626
00:41:45,702 --> 00:41:47,397
You fuckin' bastard!

627
00:41:56,446 --> 00:41:58,380
-You fucker!
-No!

628
00:41:59,616 --> 00:42:03,950
Stop it, please.
We have to go, come on! Jesus, God!

629
00:42:30,113 --> 00:42:31,410
Cock.

630
00:42:31,481 --> 00:42:34,450
I reckon it's all
to do with cock.

631
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:36,179
If you've got a big
one you're okay.

632
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:37,777
If not you're fucked.

633
00:42:37,854 --> 00:42:39,219
Are we from the
same family, huh?

634
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:42,723
What do you think Sinead?

635
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:44,784
-About what?
-Cock.

636
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,990
Only joking, father.

637
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,693
No, I mean about this place.

638
00:42:50,767 --> 00:42:52,564
Do you ever think
about getting out?

639
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:55,628
Oh, I like it here.
It's my home.

640
00:42:55,705 --> 00:42:57,400
I know every one.

641
00:42:57,474 --> 00:43:00,910
That's the problem, every bastard
knows every other bastard.

642
00:43:00,977 --> 00:43:03,844
Yeah, but this is where
I'd like to settle down.

643
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,381
With our Daniel?

644
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:08,346
Maybe.

645
00:43:08,418 --> 00:43:10,477
Good on you girl.

646
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:13,114
You two should go away
and get married,

647
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,624
set up your own parish,
and I guarantee...

648
00:43:15,692 --> 00:43:18,456
all the young people from around her
would start going to mass again.

649
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:22,422
Come on Marie, let's go.

650
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:24,126
I think these two want
to be on their own.

651
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:25,395
Good luck.

652
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:26,561
See ya.

653
00:43:30,173 --> 00:43:37,807
<i># Blue mountain river,</i>

654
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:45,515
<i># Take me to the river,</i>

655
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:53,394

656

659

660

665
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:35,096
Let me just put this here.

666
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,659
How long were you
and Frank together?

667
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:40,327
About five years.

668
00:45:40,403 --> 00:45:42,166
The church knew
he was HIV positive?

669
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,639
-Yes.
-When did they find out?

670
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:47,939
They found out about
three years ago.

671
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:50,241
Around the time of
the Vatican incident.

672
00:45:50,313 --> 00:45:51,940
Yes, that's what
promoted us to go.

673
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:55,007
We went there to a special
general council meeting.

674
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,552
We were supposed
to be discussing...

675
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:59,555
the church's viewpoint
on HIV and AIDS.

676
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:03,582
Frank and I felt that
some good might come of it.

677
00:46:05,328 --> 00:46:09,025
It was total whitewash, they were
skirting around the whole main issue,

678
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:11,363
that priests are dying of AIDS...

679
00:46:11,434 --> 00:46:13,527
and that it's being
ignored by the council.

680
00:46:13,603 --> 00:46:16,572
By the third day I was so bored
that I decided not to go,

681
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,406
but Frank went anyway
and he'd gotten so angry

682
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:22,707
and frustrated that he stood up
with a banner saying

683
00:46:22,779 --> 00:46:24,269
"the church has AIDS".

684
00:46:24,347 --> 00:46:25,541
I bet that didn't
go down too well.

685
00:46:25,615 --> 00:46:29,449
No, the heavies moved in
and he was whisked away.

686
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:30,645
<i>The church has AIDS!</i>

687
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,450
<i>I'm living with HIV and I have</i>
<i>no voice in this conference!</i>

688
00:46:34,624 --> 00:46:36,956
He was strip searched
and questioned...

689
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:39,962
He could have been a terrorist,
they said.

690
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:42,089
Eventually after checking
they believed who he was...

691
00:46:42,165 --> 00:46:44,565
and he was bundled out of the
building into a waiting car...

692
00:46:44,634 --> 00:46:46,329
and then to the airport.

693
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:50,499
The church's response to that whole
incident was the final straw.

694
00:46:50,573 --> 00:46:53,007
That's when I left
the priesthood.

695
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:55,601
I don't remember seeing
anything about it?

696
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:59,012
If the Vatican doesn't want you
to know about something, you won't.

697
00:47:01,117 --> 00:47:02,641
You sure you want to
go public with this?

698
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:04,186
Yes.

699
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:06,586
I don't want Frank's death
to be in vain.

700
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:14,987
A sympathetic photographer
sent Frank this,

701
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:16,293
I thought
it might beuseful.

702
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:18,598
Jesus.

703
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:35,550
There's no point in me going
to Bishop Queeny or Cathal.

704
00:47:35,618 --> 00:47:37,279
So he'll just dump you like that?

705
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,218
Yeah.

706
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:39,414
Even if nothing happened?

707
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:40,888
Yeah.

708
00:47:40,957 --> 00:47:43,653
Anything remotely to do
with sex is taboo,

709
00:47:43,727 --> 00:47:45,388
and they know it goes on but
as long as it's out of sight...

710
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:47,020
they turn a blind eye.

711
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:50,157
So what you're saying here is that
the common threat is celibacy.

712
00:47:50,233 --> 00:47:52,428
-Or lack of it.
-Yeah.

713
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:54,163
Well you're celibate
aren't you?

714
00:47:54,237 --> 00:47:56,000
-At least they got one.
-Yeah.

715
00:47:56,072 --> 00:47:58,267
From the moment I joined
the seminary...

716
00:47:58,341 --> 00:48:00,571
...until last night.

717
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,506
Welcome to the
human race Daniel.

718
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:11,645
I have nothing to say.

719
00:48:11,721 --> 00:48:13,951
I have things to say
worth hearing.

720
00:48:14,023 --> 00:48:16,184
Far too much...

721
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:17,077
Christian fucks!

722
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,234
Something's not right here.

723
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:50,378
I'm pulling over.

724
00:49:58,294 --> 00:49:59,454
They've stopped.

725
00:50:04,767 --> 00:50:05,495
Fuck this!

726
00:50:06,402 --> 00:50:07,027
Daniel!

727
00:52:06,489 --> 00:52:07,183
Jim!

728
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:14,827
Davey...
we need to talk.

729
00:52:14,897 --> 00:52:16,057
What's the problem?

730
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,361
This is very
difficult for me.

731
00:52:19,435 --> 00:52:20,629
What is?

732
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:24,697
I don't want this next article
on the Catholic Church.

733
00:52:25,441 --> 00:52:28,137
-What?
-No more, okay?

734
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:30,042
Cut the shite Jim,
what the fuck's going on?

735
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:32,673
I don't want to do this, Davey.

736
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:34,410
I was like you
when you started out.

737
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:37,476
I know exactly how you feel,
but this thing,

738
00:52:37,553 --> 00:52:41,114
it's... it's too big for us.

739
00:52:42,358 --> 00:52:44,223
It's out of my hands.

740
00:52:44,293 --> 00:52:47,126
What the fuck you talking about,
out of your hands?

741
00:52:47,196 --> 00:52:48,857
Since when has anything
been out of your hands!

742
00:52:48,931 --> 00:52:50,558
You're the fucking editor!

743
00:52:50,633 --> 00:52:52,828
Since today,
it's from on high.

744
00:52:52,902 --> 00:52:55,632
From who, God?
Oh, screw that!

745
00:52:55,705 --> 00:52:57,434
More powerful than God.

746
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:59,839
But it's your paper Jim,
you say what goes in it!

747
00:52:59,909 --> 00:53:02,036
Not anymore, Davey.

748
00:53:02,111 --> 00:53:05,569
Hang on a minute, we're
a local paper aren't we?

749
00:53:05,648 --> 00:53:07,081
Aren't we!

750
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:09,675
We report things that are
relevant to the local people...

751
00:53:09,752 --> 00:53:11,379
and they don't know
what's going on.

752
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:13,251
And you don't either!

753
00:53:13,322 --> 00:53:16,086
-You have no real evidence!
-But I'm finding it Jim!

754
00:53:16,959 --> 00:53:18,927
This is a story of the
church's hypocrisy!

755
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:21,555
The world is full of hypocrisy!

756
00:53:21,631 --> 00:53:23,622
Yes it is! And it's
up to journalists...

757
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,497
like me and you to point it out!

758
00:53:25,568 --> 00:53:27,763
Look, you've got to drop it
and that's final.

759
00:53:31,974 --> 00:53:33,566
You're serious aren't you?

760
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:36,935
You've had a visitor.

761
00:53:40,049 --> 00:53:42,847
What the fuck have they
got on you Jim, eh?

762
00:53:42,919 --> 00:53:44,682
Just drop it okay?

763
00:53:44,754 --> 00:53:45,721
No!

764
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:47,513
No way!

765
00:53:48,624 --> 00:53:50,990
Absolutely no way!

766
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:52,891
You're not publishing it
in this paper...

767
00:53:52,962 --> 00:53:55,795
and that's all there is to it,
so fuck off!

768
00:53:58,868 --> 00:54:00,631
Shame on you Jim.

769
00:54:02,271 --> 00:54:03,738
Shame on you.

770
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:43,538
I can't print it.

771
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:46,411
Trust me on this one Meg,
it's good.

772
00:54:46,482 --> 00:54:49,110
And more importantly,
it's true.

773
00:54:49,185 --> 00:54:52,518
Oh, and Foley gets
the credit, okay?

774
00:54:52,588 --> 00:54:54,419
It's his story.

775
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:57,914
It's me and you Lucy.
Good night.

776
00:56:06,762 --> 00:56:08,753
Frank sent this
to my office in Rome...

777
00:56:08,831 --> 00:56:12,699
with a note asking me to give it
to you the next time I saw you.

778
00:56:12,768 --> 00:56:14,565
I thought it was a
bit odd at the time.

779
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:04,816
Oh God!

780
00:57:21,737 --> 00:57:24,103
I'm so sorry Matthew.

781
00:57:24,173 --> 00:57:25,663
I knew there had to be a note.

782
00:57:28,477 --> 00:57:31,571
Did you ever know
about any of this?

783
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:32,545
No.

784
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:41,014
Poor Frank, must
have been torture.

785
00:57:46,929 --> 00:57:48,191
What are you going to do?

786
00:57:49,765 --> 00:57:50,959
I don't know.

787
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:57,071
It's hard to know what
God's will is when...

788
00:57:58,607 --> 00:58:00,871
...when things like this happen.

789
00:58:05,314 --> 00:58:08,977
The goodness of God and
the business of suffering,

790
00:58:09,051 --> 00:58:13,454
it's the eternal question, we may
never know the answer to it.

791
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:23,064
Sometimes we
prefer to blame God...

792
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:29,298
for the pain of our human condition,
but he didn't kill Frank.

793
00:58:33,275 --> 00:58:37,268
God's will, will be
revealed to us in time.

794
00:58:39,615 --> 00:58:41,708
That's why we need faith.

795
00:58:53,763 --> 00:58:55,196
Yes, thanks.

796
00:58:55,264 --> 00:58:58,791
The young priest who killed himself
and Daniel being thrown out...

797
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:01,701
is all part and
parcel of the same thing.

798
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:04,706
It says here... it's
all a cover up.

799
00:59:04,774 --> 00:59:06,105
Credit it, huh?

800
00:59:06,175 --> 00:59:08,302
Ah, you can't believe
everything you read.

801
00:59:08,377 --> 00:59:11,835
If it's written in here
there must be some truth in it now.

802
00:59:13,215 --> 00:59:15,581
Your mother will be upset,
hey Mary?

803
00:59:15,651 --> 00:59:17,084
-...when she sees this.
-What?

804
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:21,446
The newspaper article,
you've not seen it yet?

805
00:59:22,558 --> 00:59:26,221
All this talk about
priests up to no good,

806
00:59:26,295 --> 00:59:28,923
even in the Vatican itself.

807
00:59:28,998 --> 00:59:34,163
And Cardinals, close to his
holiness with this... HIV thing.

808
00:59:34,236 --> 00:59:36,761
What sort of devil talk
is that anyway!

809
00:59:38,107 --> 00:59:41,042
Your poor mommy will be
beside herself, Mary.

810
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:42,668
What do you say, huh?

811
00:59:46,382 --> 00:59:48,111
Go fuck yourself!

812
00:59:54,557 --> 00:59:55,922
O'Brien's finished.

813
00:59:55,991 --> 00:59:57,424
He assured me
it would not be published.

814
00:59:57,493 --> 00:59:59,393
Then how the hell did
The Irish Times get hold of it!

815
00:59:59,462 --> 01:00:00,520
I don't know.

816
01:00:00,596 --> 01:00:01,790
Come.

817
01:00:07,069 --> 01:00:07,797
Sorry.

818
01:00:14,176 --> 01:00:15,404
Things are moving quickly,

819
01:00:15,478 --> 01:00:17,036
they want you to appear on
television tomorrow afternoon...

820
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:19,877
on a live debate about celibacy.

821
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:21,473
That might not be
such a good idea.

822
01:00:21,550 --> 01:00:23,882
I don't think we have a choice,
we have to respond.

823
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:25,545
No doubt Foley
will be there.

824
01:00:25,621 --> 01:00:27,452
We need to give them an answer.

825
01:00:27,523 --> 01:00:29,013
Let me think about it.

826
01:00:29,091 --> 01:00:30,752
What about this young
McLaughlin boy.

827
01:00:30,826 --> 01:00:31,884
He was a good student.

828
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:33,451
We may have to reinstate him.

829
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:35,292
It might take the
wind out of things,

830
01:00:35,364 --> 01:00:37,025
especially on
live television.

831
01:00:37,099 --> 01:00:39,659
I'm not so sure, that would
really give the press...

832
01:00:39,735 --> 01:00:40,759
something to write about.

833
01:00:40,836 --> 01:00:44,704
I don't want anything
more from Foley.

834
01:00:45,941 --> 01:00:46,737
Do you understand me?

835
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:48,573
Yes.

836
01:00:50,946 --> 01:00:52,277
Do we know the boy's family?

837
01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:56,409
Well Carl does, he's on the
European Grant Selection Committee...

838
01:00:56,485 --> 01:00:57,952
and knows his father.

839
01:00:58,020 --> 01:00:59,954
See what can be done there.

840
01:01:00,022 --> 01:01:03,389
I want to know who at the
Irish Times gave the go ahead...

841
01:01:03,459 --> 01:01:05,256
for this to be published.

842
01:01:05,327 --> 01:01:06,885
I want everything
that we have on Foley...

843
01:01:06,962 --> 01:01:08,623
and everything that we don't have.

844
01:01:08,697 --> 01:01:10,358
The same on the
McLaughlin family.

845
01:01:10,432 --> 01:01:14,129
We will deal with this fiasco
once and for all.

846
01:01:14,203 --> 01:01:17,695
And I want it done properly
before Rome gets involved.

847
01:01:17,773 --> 01:01:20,503
Get Cathal and
Dowling in here now.

848
01:01:21,243 --> 01:01:22,676
The fuckin' Irish Times!

849
01:01:22,745 --> 01:01:24,406
The whole town's
talkin' about it.

850
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,313
Well so fuckin' what!
If they've nothing better to do!

851
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:28,077
Marie!

852
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:29,811
You watch your language
young girl in this house.

853
01:01:29,885 --> 01:01:32,217
And you calm down,
calm down everybody.

854
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:33,721
Well who cares what
people say anyway?

855
01:01:33,789 --> 01:01:35,154
-I do!
-We do!

856
01:01:35,224 --> 01:01:36,213
Me and your mother do.

857
01:01:36,292 --> 01:01:37,884
Oh, that's right keep up
appearances for the neighbors,

858
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,325
never mind about
your son's life.

859
01:01:39,395 --> 01:01:40,919
Don't you talk to me
about appearances.

860
01:01:40,996 --> 01:01:42,554
Oh, you'd know about
all that would ya!

861
01:01:42,631 --> 01:01:43,928
Just stay out of this Sean,
will ya!

862
01:01:43,999 --> 01:01:44,966
Fuck off, why should I!

863
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:47,002
Now look, if Daniel
ends up going in...

864
01:01:47,069 --> 01:01:48,593
If all Daniel wants to be
a fuckin' priest...

865
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:49,831
then no bastard should stop him!

866
01:01:49,905 --> 01:01:51,566
Stop, Sean!
That's enough Sean!

867
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:52,698
Leave it.

868
01:01:52,775 --> 01:01:54,936
What the fuck are you going
to do about it short ass?

869
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:56,307
Sit there and listen to
bollocks here...

870
01:01:56,378 --> 01:01:57,845
worrying about what the
fucking neighbors think?

871
01:02:03,252 --> 01:02:05,447
-Throw him out!
-You're not worth it, cunt!

872
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:07,455
I've had enough of this, that
fella's out of my house for good!

873
01:02:07,523 --> 01:02:09,753
Worse than fuckin' children,
ya know that?

874
01:02:09,825 --> 01:02:11,986
And you hangin' around with
Sinead again doesn't help either.

875
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:13,153
Dad you don't understand.

876
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:14,992
Daniel and Sinead are
meant to be together,

877
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,053
they always have been.

878
01:02:16,131 --> 01:02:18,065
Jesus Christ!
I won't listen to the lies.

879
01:02:18,133 --> 01:02:21,159
Don't! Don't dad,
please don't!

880
01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:23,397
Liz, answer the bloody phone.

881
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:28,972
Hello.

882
01:02:30,779 --> 01:02:32,178
Oh, hey, Daniel.
how you doing?

883
01:02:33,682 --> 01:02:34,671
Yeah, I just got up.

884
01:02:35,851 --> 01:02:38,217
The Irish Times, you're
fucking kidding me.

885
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:40,983
How the hell did they
get hold of that?

886
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:44,286
Yeah.

887
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:45,486
What's it say?

888
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:49,530
Yes, I'll call you back,
are you at home?

889
01:02:49,598 --> 01:02:52,761
You're being transferred
to a parish in Barlindun,

890
01:02:52,835 --> 01:02:54,325
we think it will be
better for you.

891
01:02:54,403 --> 01:02:56,030
You mean it will be
better for you.

892
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:57,766
It's a pity you did n't
think about this...

893
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,138
before talking to Foley
and his like.

894
01:03:00,209 --> 01:03:01,699
I have a right to say
when things are wrong.

895
01:03:01,777 --> 01:03:03,574
That is just your opinion.

896
01:03:03,646 --> 01:03:06,706
There are plenty in the
church who do not want change.

897
01:03:06,782 --> 01:03:08,340
And there are plenty who do.

898
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:11,113
You know you're lucky that
you're getting a parish.

899
01:03:11,186 --> 01:03:13,450
I can serve God
wherever I am.

900
01:03:17,726 --> 01:03:18,886
Time to leave Jack.

901
01:03:31,206 --> 01:03:34,004
What you did to Noel Kinahan
and Daniel McLaughlin was wrong,

902
01:03:34,076 --> 01:03:37,603
and what you did to
Frank Sweeney was contemptible.

903
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:41,047
The Catholic Church is
destroying itself from the inside.

904
01:03:42,651 --> 01:03:46,280
Don't blame me, examine
your own conscience.

905
01:03:46,355 --> 01:03:48,346
My conscience is clear.

906
01:03:48,424 --> 01:03:50,949
I hope so Aman.

907
01:03:51,026 --> 01:03:52,823
I do hope so.

908
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:05,632
He'll go straight to the press
just like Matthew Francis did.

909
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:07,175
No he won't, he's too weak.

910
01:04:07,242 --> 01:04:09,210
What are we going to do
about this TV debate?

911
01:04:09,278 --> 01:04:11,041
You and I will go.

912
01:04:11,113 --> 01:04:13,206
As the local bishop I think I have
slightly more credibility...

913
01:04:13,282 --> 01:04:14,806
than a second rate journalist.

914
01:04:16,085 --> 01:04:18,349
We will let Foley
discredit himself.

915
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:20,149
He won't back down there.

916
01:04:20,222 --> 01:04:21,519
We'll see.

917
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:27,290
That's fine for me, yeah,
yeah, I've got the details.

918
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:28,557
Listen, can I call you back?

919
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:30,063
It's just my other
phone is ringing.

920
01:04:30,132 --> 01:04:33,499
Okay, yeah.
Talk to you then, bye.

921
01:04:35,170 --> 01:04:36,068
Liz!

922
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:38,404
Hello?

923
01:04:40,275 --> 01:04:41,333
Who is this?

924
01:04:42,845 --> 01:04:44,073
Hello?

925
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:46,377
Hello?

926
01:04:47,983 --> 01:04:49,644
Ah, for fuck's sake.

927
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:53,821
If you speak out on television
they'll never let you back in.

928
01:04:53,889 --> 01:04:55,982
They won't let me
back in if I don't,

929
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:57,787
they've made that clear.

930
01:04:57,860 --> 01:04:59,487
This is my last hope.

931
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:03,057
You never know, half the country
might petition the pope on we behalf.

932
01:05:05,267 --> 01:05:06,825
I never thought
it would end like this.

933
01:05:06,902 --> 01:05:08,267
It's not over yet, Ma.

934
01:05:21,216 --> 01:05:22,843
Sinead's not helping.

935
01:05:24,153 --> 01:05:25,916
Your father's right
about that one,

936
01:05:25,988 --> 01:05:27,649
she is interfering
with your vocation.

937
01:05:27,723 --> 01:05:30,089
I haven't got a vocation
at the moment,

938
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:31,854
at least not one
I can do anything about.

939
01:05:33,996 --> 01:05:35,020
And anyway,
if I love a person,

940
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:37,122
why can't I have both?

941
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:38,928
Because that's
not Catholicism.

942
01:05:42,538 --> 01:05:44,768
Have you thought
enough about this?

943
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:48,640
I have, I've thought
about it a lot.

944
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:50,735
And I've chosen God.

945
01:05:53,015 --> 01:05:54,505
I obviously picked
the wrong one.

946
01:05:56,418 --> 01:05:57,749
I don't mean that.

947
01:05:59,621 --> 01:06:01,384
But I'm sure he wants me
to be happy...

948
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:03,288
and Sinead and I get on great.

949
01:06:04,326 --> 01:06:08,285
I know that.

950
01:06:08,363 --> 01:06:09,762
Do you know how many priests
are no longer priests...

951
01:06:09,832 --> 01:06:12,062
because they fell in love?

952
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:13,863
Priests shouldn't be
falling in love.

953
01:06:13,936 --> 01:06:16,962
They're human to o...
just like me.

954
01:06:32,054 --> 01:06:33,112
You're right.

955
01:06:36,658 --> 01:06:39,252
Wild horses wouldn't have stopped
your daddy and me getting married.

956
01:06:46,235 --> 01:06:51,605
<i># He was born and</i>
<i>raised in Ireland. #</i>

957
01:06:51,673 --> 01:06:56,406
<i># In a place called Casamay. #</i>

958
01:06:56,478 --> 01:07:06,376
<i># He was his father's only son,</i>
<i>his mother's pride and joy. #</i>

959
01:07:06,455 --> 01:07:16,228
<i># And dearly did his parents love</i>
<i>that wild colonial boy. #</i>

960
01:07:17,633 --> 01:07:19,123
Good luck to you Mickey.

961
01:07:20,102 --> 01:07:22,627
You too, John, you too,
and your family.

962
01:07:24,673 --> 01:07:27,267
Don't talk to me about
fuckin' families.

963
01:07:27,342 --> 01:07:29,572
They fucking well
bleed ya of everything.

964
01:07:29,645 --> 01:07:32,239
No thanks for anything.
Fuck it!

965
01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:35,477
What's all this I hear, John,
about your young fella Daniel?

966
01:07:36,051 --> 01:07:39,043
He's not one of them
queer boys is he?

967
01:07:39,121 --> 01:07:43,114
Jesus, no!
Bad rumors is all.

968
01:07:49,698 --> 01:07:50,630
On my way home.

969
01:07:54,736 --> 01:07:55,964
I'm sorry...

970
01:07:56,038 --> 01:07:58,506
You didn't get
the grant thing, John.

971
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:01,475
-What?
-The Euro...

972
01:08:01,543 --> 01:08:02,840
Lena McGlynn was saying
that tonight...

973
01:08:02,911 --> 01:08:04,845
How the fuck does she know?

974
01:08:04,913 --> 01:08:08,212
Sure she knows your father
before you know yourself.

975
01:08:08,984 --> 01:08:09,973
Fuck!

976
01:08:10,052 --> 01:08:14,989
Let them keep their shiny
Euros anyway, not worth a shite.

977
01:08:15,057 --> 01:08:18,993
-I'll see at mass, Mickey.
-Good luck.

978
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:32,023
-Daniel.
-Bishop.

979
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:33,761
I'll get straight to the
point given we that are...

980
01:09:33,835 --> 01:09:36,326
about to appear live
on national television.

981
01:09:36,405 --> 01:09:39,272
What you are doing and what
you have said about the church...

982
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:42,242
that you have devoted
your life to... is wrong.

983
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:43,777
And so was my dismissal.

984
01:09:43,845 --> 01:09:46,370
We had to dismiss you.
I had no choice.

985
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:47,745
You?

986
01:09:47,816 --> 01:09:50,250
Under the circumstances
I have decided to...

987
01:09:50,318 --> 01:09:53,116
consider your reinstatement,

988
01:09:53,188 --> 01:09:56,589
if not at Saint Savior's then
at another seminary.

989
01:09:56,658 --> 01:09:58,057
-What's the catch?
-There's no catch.

990
01:09:58,126 --> 01:10:01,687
You admit that your behavior was
inappropriate and that you now realize...

991
01:10:01,763 --> 01:10:04,630
that the seminary behaved correctly
under the circumstances...

992
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,396
and that way you can continue
to fulfill your calling.

993
01:10:23,685 --> 01:10:24,208
There's more to it now.

994
01:10:24,286 --> 01:10:26,345
-That shouldn't concern you.
-It should concern all of us.

995
01:10:27,389 --> 01:10:28,583
Where the fuck
are my family!

996
01:10:28,657 --> 01:10:29,555
<i>I've got your family!</i>

997
01:10:29,624 --> 01:10:32,616
You touch them, I'll come
after you, I swear to God,

998
01:10:32,694 --> 01:10:34,787
I don't care the fuck who
you are, I'll kill you!

999
01:10:34,863 --> 01:10:36,387
I'll fuckin kill you!

1000
01:10:36,465 --> 01:10:37,523
<i>We haven't touched</i>
<i>your family.</i>

1001
01:10:38,066 --> 01:10:40,159
<i>But see how easy it is</i>
<i>if we want to!</i>

1002
01:10:40,235 --> 01:10:41,964
Who is this, for fuck's sake?!

1003
01:10:42,037 --> 01:10:45,632
<i>Very carefully, I want you</i>
<i>to go into that studio...</i>

1004
01:10:45,707 --> 01:10:47,231
<i>and retract everything</i>
<i>you said in your article.</i>

1005
01:10:47,309 --> 01:10:48,241
No, I won't do that!

1006
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:49,402
<i>Are you listening</i>
<i>to me Mr. Foley?</i>

1007
01:10:49,478 --> 01:10:50,536
I'm a fuckin' journalist!

1008
01:10:50,612 --> 01:10:53,206
God's church
needs to survive,

1009
01:10:53,281 --> 01:10:57,377
there are forces of evil out there
that wish to see it destroyed.

1010
01:10:57,452 --> 01:11:00,717
Where would we be if we
didn't take a model stance, hmm?

1011
01:11:00,789 --> 01:11:02,222
That depends on
your viewpoint.

1012
01:11:03,692 --> 01:11:04,681
Fucker!

1013
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,523
<i>Are you listening</i>
<i>to me Mr. Foley?</i>

1014
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:08,062
Mr. Foley, come on
we're waiting for you,

1015
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:09,358
we're live in three minutes
we need you in...

1016
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:10,523
Give me a minute!

1017
01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:11,964
You're not listening Mr. Foley,

1018
01:11:12,033 --> 01:11:13,295
retract everything.

1019
01:11:13,368 --> 01:11:14,801
You touch them...

1020
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:19,000
If you harm them in anyway
I will fuckin' kill you!

1021
01:11:19,074 --> 01:11:20,803
Come on Mr. Foley
we really have to hurry...

1022
01:11:20,876 --> 01:11:21,774
You fuck!

1023
01:11:25,413 --> 01:11:29,474
You know Daniel, it's a pity
that your father's Eurogrant...

1024
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:31,712
was rejected because
I think that a quiet word...

1025
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:35,018
to the committee would
help them to reconsider.

1026
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:37,752
It would be a shame to bring
further hardship on your family.

1027
01:11:37,826 --> 01:11:39,885
-This way gentlemen please.
-Yes, just a moment please.

1028
01:11:41,263 --> 01:11:44,892
Think how proud your mother would be
on the day of your ordination.

1029
01:11:54,109 --> 01:11:55,542
<i>Say hello to Lucy daddy.</i>

1030
01:11:57,145 --> 01:11:58,737
<i>Say hello to Lucy daddy.</i>

1031
01:11:59,848 --> 01:12:01,440
<i>Say hello to Lucy daddy.</i>

1032
01:12:02,317 --> 01:12:03,181
<i>It's important.</i>

1033
01:12:03,251 --> 01:12:04,445
<i>It's always</i>
<i>important with you,</i>

1034
01:12:04,519 --> 01:12:05,918
<i>what's more important</i>
<i>than your family?!</i>

1035
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:37,547
Stand by studio.

1036
01:12:37,619 --> 01:12:41,248
Applause in five seconds,
four, three...

1037
01:12:53,235 --> 01:12:54,532
Thank you, good afternoon...

1038
01:12:54,603 --> 01:12:58,232
welcome again to Afternoon Live
with yours truly, Gaye Burn.

1039
01:12:58,306 --> 01:13:00,274
<i>Today on the show we are</i>
<i>debating the issue of...</i>

1040
01:13:00,342 --> 01:13:02,810
<i>celibacy in the</i>
<i>Catholic Church.</i>

1041
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:05,005
<i>Let me in troduce to you our</i>
<i>panel of speakers...</i>

1042
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:06,240
in the show today.

1043
01:13:06,314 --> 01:13:09,181
On my left, we have David
Foley who is a journalist...

1044
01:13:09,251 --> 01:13:12,311
with the Galcranagh Gazette
and he's also the author...

1045
01:13:12,387 --> 01:13:15,447
of an article in yesterday's
Irish Times which is entitled,

1046
01:13:15,523 --> 01:13:20,051
"Celibacy, the C word,
can Catholicism survive?"

1047
01:13:20,128 --> 01:13:22,187
<i>We're also joined</i>
<i>by Daniel McCloughlin,</i>

1048
01:13:22,264 --> 01:13:25,825
<i>who's recently been expelled</i>
<i>from Saint Savior's seminary in...</i>

1049
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:27,892
Oh, Daniel's got make up on,
the queer, look at him.

1050
01:13:27,969 --> 01:13:29,527
He's good looking
fucker though isn't he?

1051
01:13:29,604 --> 01:13:31,572
Shhh, quiet down
I can't hear.

1052
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,403
We're joined by the
local Diocesan bishop,

1053
01:13:33,475 --> 01:13:37,241
his grace, Michael Quinn and
with him he has his Diocesan...

1054
01:13:37,312 --> 01:13:40,839
Communications Officer,
Monsignor Thomas.

1055
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:42,543
What sort of bollocky name
is that, huh?

1056
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:48,921
<i>And we also have the outspoken</i>
<i>former Catholic priest,</i>

1057
01:13:48,990 --> 01:13:50,821
<i>Father Matthew Francis.</i>

1058
01:13:50,892 --> 01:13:53,053
And I want to start
with you David Foley...

1059
01:13:53,128 --> 01:13:57,064
<i>and your assertion in your article</i>
<i>that the Catholic Church and...</i>

1060
01:13:57,132 --> 01:14:01,933
the priesthood will not see out
this century unless...

1061
01:14:02,003 --> 01:14:07,031
they remove celibacy as a
pre-requisite for the priesthood.

1062
01:14:07,108 --> 01:14:09,838
Umm, yeah, yeah, that's right.

1063
01:14:09,911 --> 01:14:12,379
I believe that the church may well
be in trouble if it doesn't...

1064
01:14:12,447 --> 01:14:16,508
at least deal with the possibility
of the celibacy issue.

1065
01:14:16,584 --> 01:14:19,109
Um, I um, um...

1066
01:14:19,187 --> 01:14:21,655
I, I'm not saying that
celibacy is wrong,

1067
01:14:21,723 --> 01:14:22,985
it's a choice
for the individual.

1068
01:14:23,058 --> 01:14:25,526
But you did say that
in your article, David.

1069
01:14:26,895 --> 01:14:32,128
Um, yeah, what I um, what I...

1070
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:35,294
Well I'll quote you
from the article if I may,

1071
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:38,601
you're talking about the recent
suicide of the gay priest...

1072
01:14:38,673 --> 01:14:42,109
Father Frank Sweeney
and you say, and I quote,

1073
01:14:42,177 --> 01:14:45,010
"That this incident only
serves to highlight...

1074
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:47,605
the dilemma now facing
the wider church;

1075
01:14:47,682 --> 01:14:49,547
the question of celibacy".

1076
01:14:49,617 --> 01:14:52,450
Now that, I'd say
is pretty clear cut.

1077
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:55,921
-Um...
-Bishop...

1078
01:14:55,991 --> 01:15:00,951
The more serious accusation
made in Mr. Foley's article...

1079
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:05,557
is that priests, priests
that are close to the pope,

1080
01:15:05,633 --> 01:15:08,570
the Holy Father himself
are in relationships...

1081
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:10,162
and of course this
is preposterous.

1082
01:15:12,273 --> 01:15:15,572
Preposterous David Foley.

1083
01:15:15,643 --> 01:15:19,044
You know I, um...

1084
01:15:19,114 --> 01:15:21,344
Come on Davey, what's wrong
with you!

1085
01:15:21,416 --> 01:15:23,316
Forget David Foley
go to Daniel!

1086
01:15:26,087 --> 01:15:28,021
Can I just go to Daniel
McLaughlin for a moment.

1087
01:15:28,089 --> 01:15:28,885
Sorry, father.

1088
01:15:32,427 --> 01:15:36,830
I'm sorry, look, excuse me,
I know you feel strongly...

1089
01:15:36,898 --> 01:15:38,889
about this topic and
thank you for joining in.

1090
01:15:38,967 --> 01:15:41,231
I will come back to David
Foley in a few moments,

1091
01:15:41,302 --> 01:15:43,600
but first of all, Daniel,
I want to clarify this poi nt.

1092
01:15:43,671 --> 01:15:45,969
This whole issue is not
about sexual orientation,

1093
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:47,804
the church is in this
mess because it expects...

1094
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:51,209
Catholic priests to live celibate lives
and that for many is a tall order.

1095
01:15:54,049 --> 01:15:57,348
<i>Daniel, you knew that before</i>
<i>you went into the priesthood.</i>

1096
01:15:57,419 --> 01:15:58,511
<i>Yes.</i>

1097
01:15:58,586 --> 01:16:00,781
<i>And now you're faced</i>
<i>with a difficult choice.</i>

1098
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:03,387
<i>I want both.</i>

1099
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:05,323
<i>I want to be ordained</i>
<i>as a Catholic priest...</i>

1100
01:16:05,393 --> 01:16:07,020
<i>and I want to be married to</i>
<i>the girl I love.</i>

1101
01:16:07,095 --> 01:16:08,153
You tell him!

1102
01:16:14,636 --> 01:16:16,797
Your grace, it really
prompts the question,

1103
01:16:16,871 --> 01:16:21,001
why can not this obviously
sincere and dedicated young man,

1104
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:23,135
why can not he be
married and serve...

1105
01:16:23,211 --> 01:16:24,803
as a priest at the same time?

1106
01:16:24,879 --> 01:16:26,642
It goes against everything
that Christ stood for...

1107
01:16:26,714 --> 01:16:28,773
and would tear the
Catholic Church apart.

1108
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:30,750
-Rubbish, rubbish, rubbish!
-Nonsense!

1109
01:16:30,819 --> 01:16:33,982
Monsignor, that really
isn't quite true is it?

1110
01:16:34,055 --> 01:16:37,081
Professor Martin O'Connor
of Trinity College,

1111
01:16:37,158 --> 01:16:41,686
would you outline briefly for us
the history of celibacy...

1112
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:43,287
<i>in the Catholic Church.</i>

1113
01:16:43,364 --> 01:16:46,822
<i>For many centuries after</i>
<i>the time of Christ...</i>

1114
01:16:46,901 --> 01:16:48,994
priests were allowed
to get married...

1115
01:16:49,070 --> 01:16:51,231
and those priests
that did get married...

1116
01:16:51,306 --> 01:16:55,037
<i>were leaving their wealth and</i>
<i>property to their families...</i>

1117
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:58,307
<i>and the church wanted to</i>
<i>prevent them from doing this.</i>

1118
01:16:58,379 --> 01:17:02,406
So in the 12th century
they brought in celibacy.

1119
01:17:02,484 --> 01:17:04,850
You see the church was
losing too much and...

1120
01:17:04,919 --> 01:17:08,787
it wanted to build its wealth
and extend it's empire.

1121
01:17:08,857 --> 01:17:09,824
Greed!

1122
01:17:09,891 --> 01:17:13,793
Bishop, has more to do
with wealth and power?

1123
01:17:14,863 --> 01:17:18,765
It is also about God and
that unique relationship...

1124
01:17:18,833 --> 01:17:22,200
with Him... that comes
about through celibacy.

1125
01:17:23,338 --> 01:17:25,067
Are you celibate, Bishop?

1126
01:17:28,476 --> 01:17:29,443
Bravo, wheww!

1127
01:17:29,511 --> 01:17:32,446
-Sit down?! Down!
-Quiet!

1128
01:17:33,615 --> 01:17:37,278
I think this is an inappropriate forum
in which to discuss one's private life.

1129
01:17:40,321 --> 01:17:40,980
<i>Just a moment...</i>

1130
01:17:41,055 --> 01:17:43,615
Not when we're discussing
the life and death of others.

1131
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:47,155
Excuse me, I'll answer
the question if I may.

1132
01:17:47,228 --> 01:17:48,195
Please, just a moment.

1133
01:17:48,263 --> 01:17:52,165
Most people I know who serve God
are celibate, Daniel.

1134
01:17:52,233 --> 01:17:54,929
The deep spiritual
relationship that results...

1135
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:59,406
from such a union
sustains our need.

1136
01:18:06,347 --> 01:18:08,645
You didn't answer
my question Bishop.

1137
01:18:08,716 --> 01:18:10,308
Are you celibate?

1138
01:18:13,054 --> 01:18:14,112
Answer the question!

1139
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:16,487
Do you practice
what you preach!

1140
01:18:16,558 --> 01:18:18,355
How dare you!

1141
01:18:18,426 --> 01:18:21,088
No, how dare you, Quinn!

1142
01:18:22,997 --> 01:18:24,726
How dare you!

1143
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:31,597
This is a note that was
left to me by my partner.

1144
01:18:31,673 --> 01:18:35,302
Father Frank Sweeney,
before he took his own life.

1145
01:18:35,376 --> 01:18:38,072
If I may, may I
read the note Gaye?

1146
01:18:38,146 --> 01:18:40,546
I think you had better
Matthew, yes.

1147
01:18:45,553 --> 01:18:49,080
Matthew, Bishop Michael Quinn
and I had an affair...

1148
01:18:49,157 --> 01:18:50,317
when we were in Rome together.

1149
01:18:50,391 --> 01:18:52,757
...this nonsense, I am leaving.
<i>What do I do with this?</i>

1150
01:18:52,961 --> 01:18:54,121
Somebody please take this...

1151
01:18:55,396 --> 01:18:58,559
<i>...return to Ireland and</i>
<i>he threatened to rid me...</i>

1152
01:18:58,633 --> 01:19:01,625
of my parish unless
I continued to see him!

1153
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:07,302
Get out of my way!

1154
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:10,276
Serves the cunts right for
not giving us the grant, huh!

1155
01:19:10,345 --> 01:19:12,142
I don't have the moral courage
to do...

1156
01:19:12,213 --> 01:19:15,774
what you have done and
I am unable to tell you.

1157
01:19:15,850 --> 01:19:18,318
I am so sorry.

1158
01:19:18,386 --> 01:19:21,480
This is the only way out
left to me.

1159
01:19:21,556 --> 01:19:25,185
You're too good a man
to hurt like this...

1160
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:28,752
but I can't live with myself
a day longer.

1161
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:32,664
I pray that we will be together
one day in the loving arms...

1162
01:19:32,734 --> 01:19:34,725
of the God we both serve.

1163
01:19:38,873 --> 01:19:40,534
My love always...

1164
01:19:43,478 --> 01:19:44,376
Frank.

1165
01:20:53,014 --> 01:20:56,814
-I love you so much.
-I love you too Sinead.
