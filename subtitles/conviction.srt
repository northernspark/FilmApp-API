00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,590
He said, "Yeah,
what's it to you?"

320
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,560
[FAHEY] Ms.
Marsh, can you please tell the jury,

321
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,260
why did you wait more than
two years to tell the police

322
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,900
that Kenny said
he had killed Mrs. Brow?

323
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,910
I was afraid of him.
I thought he'd kill me, too.

324
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,650
[Whispers]
What is she doing to him?

325
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:48,280
I show you, Ms. Marsh, what's
marked as Exhibit number 64,

326
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,920
and I would ask if you
could identify that.

327
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,300
It's the same knife
Kenny carried.

328
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,260
And when Kenneth Waters
was brought in as a suspect,

329
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,600
did he have an alibi for the period
between midnight and 9:00 a.m.

330
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,100
On February 21st?

331
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,610
He claimed that he was working
as a cook at the Park Diner.

332
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:11,180
And what did you discover when
you checked out his alibi?

333
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,770
We confirmed that he was
at work until 5:00 a.m.,

334
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,080
but beyond that, there were no
witnesses who saw when he left.

335
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,250
His time cards
were never found.

336
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:26,420
[KATSAS] The head and chest were struck
with a ceramic lamp and a metal toaster,

337
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:31,120
and there were 30 stab wounds.
Six to the head and neck,

338
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:36,660
three to the back, one to the
abdomen and 14 to the chest.

339
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,540
Five of them
penetrated to the heart,

340
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:43,640
and one time it went through the
front and almost came out the back.

341
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,480
[HIGGINS] There was an enormous amount
of blood, mostly from the victim,

342
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:47,880
but some from
the perpetrator.

343
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,040
And what, if anything,
did you determine

344
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,120
With respect to the blood
of Katharina Brow?

345
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,950
Katharina Brow would be
identified as blood group B.

346
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:01,220
And with respect to
Exhibits 64 A through F,

347
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:04,190
did you examine those items
from the murder scene

348
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,390
and determine the blood
group present on each?

349
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:09,900
Yes. The blood on each of those
items was from blood group O.

350
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,800
And did you have occasion
to test a sample

351
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,840
from the defendant, Kenneth Waters?

352
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,810
Yes. His sample is
from blood group O.

353
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,370
[FAHEY] And what was
your relationship

354
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:24,570
with Mr. Waters after you
met the summer of 1980?

355
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,420
[ROSEANNA] Mmm...

356
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:31,580
I guess you could say we were lovers
for a while, about six months.

357
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:35,990
[FAHEY] On those occasions when you
did some drinking with Mr. Waters,

358
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,760
do you recall anything he said to you?
[Mouthing]

359
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,890
He told me he got picked
up for a murder in Ayer

360
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:45,770
and that they couldn't pin it on
him, and he laughed about it.

361
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:49,230
[FAHEY] Sometime after
the summer of 1980,

362
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:53,010
did you have another conversation with Mr.
Waters about this murder?

363
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,570
YES.

364
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,840
Um...

365
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:02,880
He told me he stabbed her and
he took her money and jewellery

366
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,550
Did he tell you
anything else?

367
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:11,460
He called her an old German bitch,
a fucking old German bitch.

368
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:18,090
After Kenneth Waters supposedly
told you, "I killed her,"

369
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,640
did you terminate
seeing him?

370
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:22,530
No. So you believed
him to be a murderer,

371
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,300
but you continued to be
romantically involved?

372
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:29,710
Yeah. Until he bashed
my teeth in.

373
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:35,880
[FAHEY] You have nine children by seven
different fathers, is that correct?

374
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,210
Objection!

375
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,260
Sustained.

376
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,920
Didn't the state, in fact,
declare you an unfit mother

377
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,430
and take your children
away from you?

378
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,660
Objection!
Irrelevant.

379
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,830
Sustained.
Watch yourself, Ms. Fahey.

380
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,900
Wasn't Kenny sent
to training school

381
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,830
for breaking into
K. Brow's home?

382
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,770
No! That wasn't...
And didn't your son

383
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:55,170
regularly break into houses
in the neighborhood?

384
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,930
[Stammering] I never condoned that
type of behavior from my children...

385
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,340
Just answer the
question, please.

386
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,910
Yes.

387
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,370
[BETTY] I hope
our place is as nice.

388
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,530
[KENNY] I'm not going to
live in no trailer.

389
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:31,440
I'm going to have a mansion
with 100 rooms.

390
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:34,670
[Chuckles] And 10 refrigerators
filled with candy.

391
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,710
And our own
private lake.

392
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,110
Lake Betty Anne
and Kenny.

393
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,950
Lake Kenny
and Betty Anne.

394
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,980
I Said it first.

395
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,720
Well, I'm older.

396
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,490
No, stop it!

397
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,320
Where's my candy?

398
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,160
Calm down, Mrs. Brow.
We'll take care of it.

399
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,320
Lee, around back.

400
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,000
[Banging On Door]

401
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,660
Open up in there.
Police.

402
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,570
Where do you think you're going?
Come here.

403
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,070
[KENNY] Go, go, go, go.

404
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:15,480
God damn it! What did I tell
you kids about trespassing?

405
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:18,920
Kenny, get over here. Stand right there.
Betty Anne, come on. Ow!

406
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,020
Come here, Betty Anne, come here.
[Betty Shrieks]

407
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:25,720
Get over here.

408
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,360
Hey, fat ass, your
mother's a dirty whore.

409
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,660
Come here. Ow!

410
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,730
You don't touch my sister.
Don't you touch my sister.

411
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,000
Don't touch her.

412
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,340
[OFFICER]
Take him to the ground.

413
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,700
Get down.

414
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,280
[Grunting]

415
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,900
Kenny!

416
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:45,180
Go, run.
Run, Betty Anne. Run!

417
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,080
[BETTY]
we were just kids.

418
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,720
We'd play in people's houses and
pretend we had a normal life.

419
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,350
I don't know what
you're talking about.

420
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:53,890
You had a perfectly
normal life.

421
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:56,950
Yeah. Eight foster homes.
Perfectly normal.

422
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,290
There, baby.

423
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,760
[ELIZABETH] The only reason
they took you away from me

424
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,230
is because I worked too much.

425
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:02,870
I had no life
except for you kids.

426
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,460
We know, Mother.
You were practically a nun.

427
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:09,600
But Kenny, he'd be
like a wild animal.

428
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,580
I'm not saying he was born
bad, but he had that temper.

429
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,770
I was always afraid
he might kill somebody.

430
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,880
Don't you ever say that
to me or anyone else!

431
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,750
Don't you even think it,
you understand me?

432
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:24,450
I mean, what kind of mother
would say something like that?

433
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:33,300
[ELIZABETH] They're my babies!
They can't do this!

434
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:34,660
[GRANDPA]
They bloody well can.

435
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,460
[ELIZABETH] Why do they
have to separate them?

436
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,830
Why can't they go
to one foster home?

437
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,250
Shh!

438
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,200
[BOISSEAU] I hate
to split them up.

439
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,380
Okay, Kenny.
Come with me.

440
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,510
Where you raking mm?

441

You are going to
come with me, honey.

442
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,780
No, I don't want to.

00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,220
Come on, fellow, now.

444

Stop! No!
Let go of him!

445
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,160
Betty, stop, stop. Let him go.
You got to let him go.

446
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,990
Please, no!
[BETTY] Don't take my brother!

this indictment charging

what say you,

Is the defendant
guilty or not guilty?

We find the defendant
guilty, Your Honor.

[CLERK]
Guilty of what?

457
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,190
Murder in the

Is the defendant

close, motherfucker!

Settle down! I said
you got to settle down!

479
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,000
You want some of this shit?

[BETTY] Did you tell
Mr. Peters it was urgent?

485
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,580
I haven't heard
from Kenny in two weeks.

mouth, buddy.

Something's wrong,
I know it.

We should have heard
from Kenny by now.

You got to make
peace with this.

We got a family here.
This is us now.

What do you mean?
What happened?

Your brother's in
isolation, so no calls...

Why is he in isolation?

There's nothing left.
It's over.

the Supreme Court.

Don't laugh, all right?

00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,110
I'm going to start by
trying to get a BA

00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,240
after I finally take
the stupid GED test,

00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,910
and after that,
if I even get that far,

00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:42,480
and there's no guarantee
I'll even get in,

00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,820
I'll apply to law school.

562
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:50,720
But it is going to take along time,
Kenny, a really long time,

563
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:53,320
and, I mean,
I might be 80 years old

564
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,590
before I finally
become a lawyer,

565
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:58,000
and even then, I still don't know
if I'm going to find the answers.

[KENNY] I found this
book in the library.

It says that women hardly ever shoot
themselves when they commit suicide.

he shot her?

00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,570
I don't know,
we'll investigate.

604
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,900
And then they'd take him more seriously
as a suspect in the Brow case.,.

605
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,970
But Romeo Collad's dead, so...

So... So, what?

607

It could still be enough
to re-open the case.

608
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:22,310
We just got to find a precedent.

I'm the one in jail.

What are you talking about?
What does that mean?

621

It means that if I don't
improve, I'm out,

But you're doing... You're doing so...
You're doing great.

00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,210
for working on
a real fucking case.

630
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,870
They don't care about that.

631
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,810
Look, don't worry
about this, okay?

632
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:33,940
I'm going to
take care of it.

633
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,610
Okay?

634
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:40,890
Okay, okay.
Hey, don't cry, honey.

635
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:43,860
You're worth a thousand
of them preppy shitheads.

636
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,520
Don't cry, okay?

637
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:48,520
I know, I'm sorry.

638
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:49,690
[GUARD] No touching.

639
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,840
[Indistinct]

640
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:08,680
Hi.
[RICHARD] Hi.

641
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:12,910
You guys have
a nice weekend?

642
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,090
Yeah.
[BETTY] Yeah?

643
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,260
Get any homework done?
A little.

644
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,350
[BEN] Yeah.
[BETTY] Yeah?

645
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:23,560
Okay, what's going on?

646
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,100
Hmm?

647
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,400
Come on, talk.
What happened?

648
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:36,770
We were thinking, you know, since
you've been so busy and all...

649
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:42,210
We were thinking that maybe
we want to live with Dad.

650
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:46,520
That son of a bitch!
He put you up to this?

651
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:47,750
No.

652
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:48,950
Did he?

653
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,220
No.

654
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:56,900
I need a guy around,
you know? For guy things.

655
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,970
You feel the same way?

656
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:06,980
Kind Of.

657
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,080
[Sighs]

658
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:22,830
Call me, okay? Lei me know how
you do on your math test.

659
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,120
Okay.
I love you.

660
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:28,260
And you, you don't forget
to set your alarm.

661
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:30,060
If you're late for English again...
I know, Mom, I know.

662
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,400
Watch your head.
Come here. [Kissing]

663
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,500
All right, stop, Mom. Stop!

664
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:36,640
I love you. I love you so much.
I love you, too, Mom.

665
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:37,760
Okay.

666
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,670
I'll see you Friday.
We'll go to the movies.

667
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,340
Bye, bye.

668
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,280
[Panting]

669
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:59,690
[Sobbing]

670
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:03,100
[PROFESSOR BLOCK] Samson.
Here.

671
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:04,530
Shaw.
Here.

672
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:08,460
Stevens. Taylor.

673
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:09,630
[TAYLOR] Present.

674
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,200
Thomassen.
Yeah.

675
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,170
Vaughn.
Here.

676
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:18,280
Waters. Waters?
Betty Anne Waters?

677
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,820
[ABRA] Come on, up.

678
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,320
I'm unfit.
Just like my mother.

679
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:28,860
Will you knock it Off?
That is not true.

680
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:33,730
But I'll tell you what.
If you keep missing classes, you will fail.

681
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:37,990
I've already failed.
I lost my boys.

682
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:42,400
Betty,
you didn't lose them.

683
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:47,080
I wasn't there for them.
I wasn't.

684
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,680
I can't help Kenny.

685
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:52,210
Especially if you get
kicked Out Of law School.

686
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,820
There's your underwear,
there's your jeans,

687
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,720
[Sniffs] that's clean.
Come on, get dressed.

688
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:01,490
I can't. I can't.

689
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:11,170
Just come to school today.
Start there.

690
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:38,390
[Sighing]

691
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,640
[KENNY] Life's swell here at the
Hilton, food's fucking fantastic,

692
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,400
just like Ma used to make.

693
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,310
Can you send me
more white socks?

694
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,240
I love you and
I miss you very much.

695
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:07,390
I, Kenneth Waters,
being of sound mind,

696
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:09,090
leave all my
worldly possessions

697
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:10,490
to my sister,
Betty Anne Waters.

698
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:15,460
Also, most important, I'm giving her
full authority on any decisions

699
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:18,990
concerning my daughter
Mandy Marsh's well-being.

700
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,250
[SCOTT] So, two of us
will be defense attorneys,

701
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,510
two will be
the prosecutors.

702
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:34,810
Thanks for
dropping by, Waters.

703
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,120
Nice ironing job.

704
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:40,180
[SCOTT] And then we need a
defendant, and a paralegal.

705
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:42,160
I nominate Betty Anne
to be the defendant.

706
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:43,780
What's my alleged crime?

707
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:44,850
Uh... Rape.

708
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:49,030
Oh. Gee, thanks.
What case did they assign us?

709
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:51,370
You'd know that if you
actually came to class.

710
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:52,630
Shut the fuck up.

711
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:54,870
Sewell v. State, 1992.

712
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,640
Sewell had already served 10
years in prison for rape,

713
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:00,470
and then he sued the state for the
right to DNA test the rape kit.

714
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:03,970
DNA test?

715
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,140
Yeah, the semen in the rape kit wasn't his.
The DNA didn't match.

716
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:09,880
And he won?

717
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:11,380
YES.

718
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:15,290
Yeah, look. "Advances in technology
may yield protection for exculpation

719
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:17,230
"where none
previously existed."

720
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:22,060
[SCOTT] All right, so who
wants to be the paralegal?

721
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:04,440
[Knocking At Door] Abra.

722
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:08,780
It's the blood.
This is the key.

723
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,380
What?
There was so much blood.

724
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,680
Look, I'm going to
get Kenny out.

725
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:14,270
There were no
DNA tests then.

726
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,850
They only knew that the murderer
was type O and so is Kenny.

727
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,520
But now, if we can DNA test the
murderers blood and Kenny's,

728
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,620
it'll prove Kenny's innocent,
just like in the rape case.

729
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:22,780
Berry.

730
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:24,250
I'm sorry, Don.

731
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,460
There are 49 other cases
like this.

732
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:27,890
[Stammers]

733
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:30,560
Wait. How do you know the
blood evidence still exists?

734
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:32,360
'Cause we're going to find it.

735
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:34,130
And Barry Scheck
is going to help.

736
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:35,600
Here, look.

737
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:36,870
Oh, I see.
Barry Scheck.

738
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:40,300
This is what he does. Look, he has
this Innocence Project in New York.

739
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:42,940
And you're just going to call him up
and he's going to take your case?

740
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,070
Yes!

741
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:46,140
Are we both going to sleep
with him or just you?

742
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,950
Abra, God. Look.

743
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,250
Dear Mr. Scheck, I would greatly
appreciate any assistance

744
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:55,090
you and the Innocence
Project can provide

745
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:56,960
in helping me free
my brother, Kenny,

746
00:45:57,050 --> 00:45:58,890
From a life-without-parole sentence.

747
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:05,090
In 1983, Kenny was convicted in
Massachusetts of first-degree murder

748
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,260
with extreme atrocity
and armed robbery.

749
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,500
I have done everything in my
power for the last 16 years

750
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,940
to prepare myself to prove
my brother's innocence.

751
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:18,070
You good?

752
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,940
I can't find it.
I can't find my ID.

753
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:24,290
[ABRA] You checked your whole wallet?
[BETTY] Twice!

754
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,180
[AERA] You can't take
the Bar exam without ID.

755
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:27,620
Abra Rice.

756
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:29,790
[WOMAN] Rice.

757
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:36,800
[ABRA] Thank you.
Thanks. [WOMAN] Next.

758
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,840
I'm sorry, I can't find my ID.
Just one second.

759
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,000
Look what I found
in my...

760
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,130
There.
You bitch.

761
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,500
[Laughs]

762
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,700
it's funny.
I can't believe you did that.

763
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:48,470
[WOMAN] Waters.
You almost gave me a heart attack.

764
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:52,040
She's very old and she can't
remember a single thing.

765
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:53,970
[BETTY] Mr. Scheck,

766
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:57,020
the day that my brother was
unjustly convicted of this crime,

767
00:46:57,110 --> 00:46:59,890
changed not only
his life, but mine.

768
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:08,200
[HUY] Dear Ms. Waters, I've enclosed
an application for your brother Kenny

769
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:10,360
to complete and return
to our office.

770
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:13,240
I must stress that
we only accept cases

771
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:16,310
where DNA evidence
can exonerate the accused.

772
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:20,980
It will be vital for us to determine
if any such evidence still exists.

773
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,570
Without DNA evidence, it will be
impossible for us to proceed.

774
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:30,180
The Innocence Project has a
backlog of several hundred cases,

775
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:32,890
so I must caution that it
will be at least 18 months

776
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:35,520
before we can begin to
evaluate your brother's case.

777
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:41,590
If however, you pass the Bar exam
and become your brother's attorney,

778
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:45,730
you yourself can begin looking for
the DNA evidence immediately.

779
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:48,360
If you manage to find it,

780
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:51,870
Mr. Scheck may agree to act
as consulting attorney,

781
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:54,280
in which case
we can work together

782
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:56,280
towards exonerating
your brother.

783
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,290
[RICHARD] Mom?

784
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:11,790
[BETTY]
I'm in the kitchen.

785
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,860
Damn thing's
still frozen.

786
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:16,420
[Richard Sighs]

787
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,970
Thin's good, right?
Didn't you say that?

788
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:21,600
Open it.
Are you sure?

789
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,400
Don't look at it.
Just hold it up for me to read.

790
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:30,570
Don't look!

791
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,710
I'm not.

792
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:36,880
Thank you, God.

793
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:41,590
Did you hear
what I said?

794
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:43,780
Kenny?

795
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:50,330
[Whoops] Yeahs
We did its We did in

796
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:51,930
My baby sister!

797
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:53,490
[GUARD #1] Muddy,
would you please sit down?

798
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:57,630
My baby sister did it!
My baby sister just passed the Bar.

799
00:48:57,730 --> 00:48:59,640
Yeah, yeah. I understand,
but you have to sit down.

800
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:00,800
[GUARD #2]
Waters, have a seat.

801
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,740
You have to take
a seat, now!

802
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:05,140
Right, okay.
I'm going to take a seat.

803
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:06,850
Sit down. No, come on.

804
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:08,640
[Kenny Whoops]

805
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,950
Gel the hell off of me!
What the hell is wrong with you?

806
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:13,250
Sit down! Sit down.

807
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:14,450
[Laughs] Okay.

808
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:16,530
I'm cool.
I'm all right.

809
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,860
Okay, okay.

810
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,800
So proud of you.

811
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:31,000
I'm proud of you.

812
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:38,940
[OFFICER] Ayer police.

813
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,280
Hi. I'm an attorney, and I'm calling
regarding evidence from a 1983 case.

814
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,310
Your name, please?

815
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,050
Um...

816
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,390
Abra Rice.

817
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:52,650
If they realize I'm one
of the Waters kids,

818
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,530
God knows what they'd do
to the evidence. You know?

819
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:55,960
I just don't trust them.

820
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:57,130
[ABRA] You could have
used your married name.

821
00:49:57,190 --> 00:49:58,460
Yeah, but then
when I want to be me,

822
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,130
I won't be able to
'cause I was someone else.

823
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:01,870
I want to be me
when I need to be me.

824
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:04,870
So to solve this problem,
you decided to be me?

825
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,240
Just this once.

826
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:09,180
Nice. Yeah,
I love those shoes.

827
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,540
But from this point on...

828
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:11,740
You need me to be me.

829
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:12,910
Right.

830
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,980
Okay. So what did the Ayer
Police tell me, again?

831
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,680
They don't have the
evidence there anymore.

832
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:20,490
It's at the courthouse
where we had Kenny's trial.

833
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,250
That's where I need you
to call on Monday.

834
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,590
On Monday. Okay.

835
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,030
I understand
if you can't help.

836
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:29,360
I mean, I don't want to do anything
to jeopardize your new job.

837
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:31,230
I mean, this is my cause, not yours.

838
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,230
It's my cause, too.

839
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:36,270
Okay. Does this make me
look like Barbara Bush?

840
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,430
A little.

841
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:38,930
Yeah.

842
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:41,940
I don't deserve
a friend like you.

843
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:44,410
You're damn right
you don't.

844
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:51,080
That's right.
Waters. 1983.

845
00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:57,090
Okay, well, isn't it possible
that it's still In.,.

846
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:59,290
[Whispering] What?
What are they saying?

847
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:04,530
Do you have an actual date
when that would have happened?

848
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:06,090
[Whispers]
What happened?

849
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:10,200
Okay. Thank you.

850
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:13,300
What? What did they say?
What did they say?

852
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:20,880
Berry, they destroyed n.

853
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:23,540
What?

854
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:24,880
According to
Massachusetts law,

855
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:26,950
they destroy evidence
after 10 years,

856
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:30,430
and Kenny's evidence was
destroyed in April, 1993.

857
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,260
[Voice Breaking]
That is not possible.

858
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,160
I did come this far,
after all this time...

859
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:35,600
I'm sorry.
No, wait

860
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:38,930
It has to be there. No. It has to be there.
It's his only chance.

861
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:40,600
Look, we're going to
make them look for it.

862
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:41,890
Honey, there's
nothing to look for.

863
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,100
We're going to make them look for it.
Sorry.

864
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,160
We're going to make
them look for it.

865
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:48,270
[ABRA] I understand
what your records...

866
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:49,400
[BETTY] I know,
but I was hoping that

867
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:51,240
by some chance, the sample might
have been left at your lab.

868
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:52,940
But the woman I spoke to last
week said she would look.

00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:54,780
Alice O'Malley.

870
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:57,280
Okay, well, is Kathleen
Higgins still working there?

871
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:59,790
She testified at
the original trial.

872
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:01,520
Linda Clarke.

873
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:03,290
And she checked every single
box in that basement?

874
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:04,790
[Whispers]
Ask for the supervisor.

875
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:06,850
Can I speak to your
supervisor, please?

876
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:09,430

Okay. Well,
thanks for looking.

Hi, this is Abra Rice again.

879
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,270
I'm sure Ms. Clarke
searched thoroughly.

880
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:21,540
Yeah, if you yourself
could look.

881
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:22,770
[Whispers] Yeah.

882
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:25,540
What?

883
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:30,880
No, I didn't realize
you already...

in the best mood.

Okay. Start eating.

00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:40,190
It's just a setback.

What am I going to do, Abra? Give up?
Is that what you're saying?

It's gone.

Can't they look again?
They did.

902
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:50,510
Mistakes happen.

903
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,970
Obviously, or Kenny
wouldn't be in prison.

904
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:54,440
Berry, they destroyed n.

905

No.

That evidence exists Somewhere
and I'm going to find it.

Okay. Let's say
you do find it.

908

What if the DNA
matches Kenny's?

Get out. Get the hell out

you and you may not win!

thought of that?

Can I help you?
Yeah.

I'm an attorney, Abra Rice,

from the Kenneth Waters trial.

Yeah, we spoke
on the phone.

926

Did you check
with the courthouse?

927
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:08,440
Yeah, and they
can't locate it.

928
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,670
Yeah, well, like I said, they
probably destroyed it by now.

like, what...

send me a birthday card!
