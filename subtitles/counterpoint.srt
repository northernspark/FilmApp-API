Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

2
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,916
Our conductor got us full coverage,
General.

3
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,470
AP, UP, Routers and the first
string music critic from Le Monde.

4
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,718
You Special Service boys are
giving this outfit the shaft.

5
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,270
General Patton gets Marlene Dietrich,
Bradley gets Bob Hope,

6
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,070
we get culture
in a bombed out Belgium opera house.

7
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,948
The 82nd Airborne has Scheduled
a performance at the Royal Ballet.

8
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,914
- At least the ballet's got girls.
- Don't worry, we've got girls.

9
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,435
All military personnel.
Report to your units immediately.

10
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,676
Gentlemen, it seems we're involved
in a mass exodus.

11
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,473
I trust it isn't entirely
the result of your performance.

12
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,309
We've got to evacuate. German's
have started a counter offensive.

13
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,674
Keep your places!

14
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:04,039
The enemy has cut off all roads
to Baston. Head North to Huy.

15
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,791
Each of you is responsible for your
instruments, music and yourselves.

16
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,120
Section leaders are responsible
for their sections.

17
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,918
None will board
the bus until all are ready.

18
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,997
For the first time, this
orchestra will finish together.

19
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,236
- Lionel, hurry up!
- Maestro!

20
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,954
<i>Presto!</i>

21
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,434
Come on, hurry up!

22
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,032
All right, Henry, get going!

23
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,512
If you're heading for Huy forget it.
Could be a Berlin suburb by now.

24
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,231
You'd best go north to Stavelot.
3rd Army is in control there.

25
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,715
Thanks.

26
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,915
Hey USO,
say hello to Betty Grable for me.

27
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:16,512
- Who's Betty Grable?
- An American film-star.

28
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,998
<i>Patrol 17.</i>

29
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,755
Dorothy, put the Viola on the floor.
Instruments aren't easy to replace.

30
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,192
But musicians are.

31
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,476
What is it?

32
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,351
Everyone stay where he is.
I'll handle this.

33
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,669
Keep your high-school German to
yourself and don't give me orders.

34
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,078
All right. I'm Lionel Evens,
the conductor of this orchestra.

35
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,232
This man is our driver.
We are all non-combatants.

36
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,431
- Non-combatants?
- Yes.

37
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,237
And what are you? Spanish? Brazilian?

38
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,073
They're not Army.
They're entertainers.

39
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,990
And you? What are you?

40
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,518
- Swedish?
- Corporal. US Army. I'm a soldier.

41
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,789
Wrong.

42
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,478
You are nothing.

43
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,032
He was a prisoner, as you are.

44
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,033
You can't do this.

45
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,554
I have orders.

46
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:19,868
Every prisoner taken
in this offensive shall be shot.

47
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,794
I don't care what your orders say.
They don't apply to us.

48
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,158
- Do you read French?
- No.

49
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,556
You better take a look at this!

50
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,440
We're not just a bunch
of itinerate fiddlers,

51
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,672
we're a highly respected
international symphony orchestra.

52
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,351
If you make the mistake of shooting
us, you'll be a lieutenant forever.

53
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,157
I'll take you back to division
headquarters and confirm the orders.

54
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,754
- Get back on the bus.
- We should be allowed to go...

55
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,472
Enough! Get back on the bus.

56
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,278
The wheel must be changed. You two.
Go and do it!

57
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,829
Hurry up!

58
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,549
Penguins.

59
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,315
Bravo.

60
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,350
Minor executive. I've dealt
with that type all my life.

61
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,114
The thing they do best is pass
the buck.

62
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,633
Panzer division.

63
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,709
Operating out
of an authentic medieval castle.

64
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,197
That is where the buck stops.

65
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,953
<i>Come Captain.</i>

66
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,196
<i>Send this message to Luetzdorf.</i>

67
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,634
<i>Without fuel</i>, <i>we'll be trapped here.</i>

68
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,950
<i>We're aware the</i>
<i>Americans know of our whereabouts.</i>

69
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,311
English, Captain, English.

70
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,151
I enjoy surprising
Coronel Arndt occasionally.

71
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,111
There's only one pair of eyes.

72
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,359
But more than his usual
accompaniment of ears.

73
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,949
<i>Put it there.</i>

74
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,035
<i>Careful. It means a lot to me.</i>

75
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,359
I've made our position obvious

76
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,671
so the Americans
will suspect deception.

77
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,278
And anticipate a strike
on their munitions dumps in Spa.

78
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,513
Therefore, we'll do the obvious
and attack Namur.

79
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,997
But I need appropriate fuel
from my reserve stores.

80
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,311
I'll send out three armored units
at dusk.

81
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,357
We have to force the Americans
to wasting their strength at Spa.

82
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,872
In Clausewitz's, "The Art of War", he
warns against overuse of deception.

83
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,828
Captain Klingerman,

84
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:55,630
20th Century war cannot be solved by
a 19th Century mind.

85
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,713
Clausewitz was never immobilized by
the shortage of fuel for his tanks.

86
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,471
The Partisans have been executed.

87
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,395
At least Arndt has found
an antidote to boredom.

88
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,758
<i>Becker</i>, <i>quick.</i>
T<i>ake these men to the barracks.</i>

89
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,514
<i>Yes</i>, <i>sir. Come on. Let's go.</i>

90
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,949
<i>Stop.</i>

91
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,953
A bus.

92
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,589
Lieutenant Heisse has captured a bus.

93
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,712
It probably will run out of fuel.

94
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,759
<i>- Who are they?</i>
<i>- An American symphony orchestra.</i>

95
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,475
<i>You took soldiers to</i>
<i>the front to escort prisoners?</i>

96
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,350
<i>- I thought that as they're not...</i>
<i>- You thought?</i>

97
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,229
<i>Keep to your orders!</i>

98
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,560
Demand that we be
released immediately. Tell him!

99
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,709
<i>Do you understand?</i>

100
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,995
<i>With the others.</i>
T<i>ake him with the others. Quickly!</i>

101
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,911
<i>Hurry! Form a group with the others!</i>

102
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,468
<i>Are you sleeping?</i>

103
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,630
<i>More quickly.</i>

104
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,398
<i>All together!</i>

105
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,592
It's not true, Alfred.
This is a nightmare.

106
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,829
<i>Prepare arms!</i>

107
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,515
<i>Load arms!</i>

108
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,274
Stop this! Do you hear me!
Stop this!

109
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,630
<i>- Aim!</i>
<i>- You can't do this!</i>

110
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,635
<i>Coronel Arndt!</i>

111
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,715
<i>Ha</i>v<i>e you gone mad?</i>
<i>Bring this man to me.</i>

112
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,239
<i>It's Lionel E</i>v<i>ans!</i>

113
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,512
Who is Lionel Evens?

114
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,116
<i>Come with me.</i>
<i>Hold on.</i>

115
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,715
I want my people released
immediately. You cannot do this.

116
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,549
- I want your commanding officer.
- Silence!

117
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,638
I'm not a prisoner.
I'm not a combatant.

118
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,633
- I remind you the Geneva Convention.
- Coronel Arndt!

119
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:36,590
I should not like Mr. Evens
shot before we've been introduced.

120
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,714
General Schiller,
may I present Mr. Lionel Evans.

121
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,036
I am Captain Klingerman,
a devoted admirer, Mr. Evans.

122
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,631
I possess a collection of your
recordings I believe to be definitive.

123
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,590
I once had the privilege of attending
one of your piano recitals. In Vienna.

124
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,516
Your only appearance there.
You were superb.

125
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,672
- I was rotten.
- No, you were superb.

126
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,399
I mean, technically.

127
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,518
But you were very young then,
at the time.

128
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,509
General.

129
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,991
- My men are waiting.
- Why don't you join them?

130
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,359
Fresh air! Essential to health.

131
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,672
Your body is a temple.
Do not neglect it.

132
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,509
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

133
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,436
Please forgive
the intramural bickering of command.

134
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,235
- I wouldn't tolerate it
- A refreshing attitude.

135
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,510
Please, come up.
<i>You may lea</i>v<i>e.</i>

136
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,440
Especially from one in your position.

137
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,230
Please. Excuse me.

138
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,355
<i>Yes.</i>

139
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,477
<i>Yes</i>, <i>yes.</i>
<i>Go to Butzenback.</i>

140
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,349
General Schiller...

141
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,718
T<i>hey'</i>v<i>e all been told.</i>
<i>No</i>, <i>to Butzenback.</i>

142
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,268
Let us go.

143
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,797
- We have our orders.
- We're no conceivable military threat.

144
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,918
Extra mouth to feed.
Provision for shelter.

145
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,278
These things constitute a drain
on our resources.

146
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,916
A small price for the lives
of 70 uniquely skilled people.

147
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:23,118
Then your appeal is made
for the privileged few.

148
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,551
Rather than in the name of humanity.

149
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,952
Not terribly American of you.

150
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,193
I'm trying to think German.

151
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,794
- You're not succeeding.
- Then switch the appeal to threat.

152
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,199
- The execution of my musicians...
- And their conductor.

153
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,676
...would be an act of atrocity.
Not only a barbarian...

154
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,109
You Americans,
so addicted to stereotypes.

155
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,718
It would be the act of an imbecile.

156
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,310
I am a soldier. And I have my orders.

157
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,392
It's nice, isn't it?

158
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,837
It traveled with me half way across
North Africa and Western Europe.

159
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,838
Out of my favorite gear. Along
with pictures of my favorite nieces.

160
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,509
Of course.

161
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,675
I'm an amateur.

162
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,958
Schadenfreude.

163
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,759
Only the German language
could provide a word meaning

164
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,233
pleasure derived
from someone else's pain.

165
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,549
May I remind you that the word
sadism comes from the French.

166
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,999
- I'm trying to think American.
- Excellent.

167
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,797
Then you'll be reasonable.

168
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,670
This division's offensive has been
delayed by lack of fuel for tanks.

169
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,395
The boredom of inaction is the least
supportable action of military life.

170
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,348
A performance, a concert
for you and your orchestra

171
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,516
could serve to dispel that boredom.

172
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,675
No.

173
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,955
Mr. Evans, please.

174
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,598
You and I are men who
have learned our skills.

175
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,112
There can be no reason not
to practice one's skills.

176
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,234
You skills may be for sale to
the first bidder, but

177
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,395
mine aren't.

178
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,910
Take an American stance. All
men are created equally immortal.

179
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,399
Go to hell.

180
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,271
You're amusing.

181
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,830
That is part of the artist's cause.
To amuse, to divert, dispel boredom.

182
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,109
But the artist like art,
must also be functional.

183
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,594
Utilitarian. Don't you think?

184
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,233
Louis XVI, intrinsically priceless.

185
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,631
It's utilitarian value...

186
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,238
It can warm us.

187
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,235
I burn very slowly.

188
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,148
<i>Colonel Arndt!</i>

189
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,070
You will perform.
You will play the concert.

190
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,434
I am not a whore.

191
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,273
- There are degrees of prostitution.
- Like pregnancy.

192
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,710
T<i>ake the prisoners</i>
<i>to the cellar and stand guard.</i>

193
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,558
You'll need your musicians
for the concert.

194
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,234
<i>Captain Klingerman</i>,

195
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:31,720
escort the prisoner.

196
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,075
Prostitution isn't the only
profession ruined by amateurs.

197
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,109
Ladies and gentlemen, listen to me.

198
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,672
- Maestro, are they going to kill us?
- No.

199
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,513
Don't lie to us. We're not children.

200
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,950
They're going to murder us all.

201
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,392
I made it perfectly clear to the
general we are not soldiers.

202
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,674
First, I want everybody to put
on the warmest things you have.

203
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,398
Stay as close together as possible.
This cellar doesn't have heating.

204
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,630
We've all toured with corrupt concert
managers. This shouldn't be different.

205
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,872
- Right here, Lionel.
- Thank you, Victor.

206
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,998
That was a nice tune. It sounded
like you were whistling in the dark.

207
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,952
What's going to happen?
What's he like?

208
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,470
Professionally,
he must be something of a genius.

209
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,798
He's a general, hardly
looks old enough to be a major.

210
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:25,117
Personally, General Schiller is
an arrogant, egotistical martinet

211
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,710
with all the classic symptoms
of a god complex.

212
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,515
That should be a familiar experience.

213
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,792
You're too angry.
He makes you too angry.

214
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,759
<i>I remind you that the orders</i>
<i>about the prisoners are definiti</i>v<i>e.</i>

215
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,913
Let me remind you that
I can read perfectly well.

216
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,273
<i>Colonel Arndt</i>, <i>don't forget this:</i>

217
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,358
I respect you highly as an officer,
but don't be my military conscience.

218
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:08,072
The orders from Berlin. Commanders
are removed for lack of execution.

219
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,630
I'll execute them at my own
discretion. Rank has its privileges.

220
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,708
I will have my concert from this man.
You're dismissed.

221
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,029
T<i>hank you.</i>

222
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,480
<i>Send a message to Berlin.</i>

223
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,799
<i>He must not be</i>
<i>allowed any other conduct.</i>

224
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,991
<i>Directly to Berlin.</i>

225
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,669
<i>I understand</i>, <i>Colonel.</i>

226
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,835
Lionel,

227
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,553
forgive the venom.

228
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,790
You remembered my name.
That comes as a shock.

229
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,192
Deathbed recollection.

230
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,239
They say you remember the strangest,
most trivial things.

231
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,749
Lionel.

232
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,237
I have a surprise for you.

233
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,672
These men were under the bus.

234
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,479
I'm Lieutenant Long, this is
Sergeant Calloway. US Infantry.

235
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,951
But you're out of uniform.

236
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,670
Well if they catch us, they shoot us
instead of just plain shooting us.

237
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,435
Meanwhile, you're endangering
the lives of 70 innocent people.

238
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:01,118
- Is anybody a musician.
- I played the trombone in College.

239
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,076
But just by ear.
Nobody could read music.

240
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,639
Ladies and gentlemen,

241
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,638
it seems the US Army is taking
a cue from the musicians' union.

242
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,797
They've saddled us
for a couple of stand-bys.

243
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,790
Jordan, hide them, quick.

244
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,155
May I come in?

245
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,508
<i>Close the door.</i>

246
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,159
This place is uncomfortable
enough as it is. You will forgive me.

247
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:45,469
And for taking me so long to
welcome you. Profession obligations.

248
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,119
I'm General Schiller.

249
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,312
I demand that we be given
adequate food and shelter.

250
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,755
These conditions are unlivable.

251
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,959
Naturally, Mr. Evans, you demand.
You always demand!

252
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,355
That is your way.

253
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,515
And you will have your way.
Food has been prepared for you.

254
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,389
And quarters have been made ready
in the chapel.

255
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,910
I'm sure you'll find
them more livable.

256
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,955
There's even an imitation of plumbing.

257
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,435
Whenever you're ready,
my men will help you move.

258
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:30,073
Mr. Evans, will you introduce me
to these talented people?

259
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,593
This is Victor Rice,
my concert master.

260
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,073
Yes, the orchestra's First Sergeant.

261
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,117
- Fraulein.
- That's my wife.

262
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,949
<i>A beautiful woman.</i>

263
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,719
Especially designed for our winters.

264
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,468
No, thank you.

265
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,989
- Your instrument?
- The Cello.

266
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,555
Charming.

267
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:16,432
Ladies and gentlemen, there's
one consideration I would ask.

268
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,148
In exchange
for these small hospitalities.

269
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,560
I would be most grateful if you
would provide us with entertainment.

270
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,634
Perhaps a concert.

271
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,029
No.

272
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,348
I won't allow it.

273
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,232
For the product of a democracy,
you are an outrageous autocrat!

274
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,313
A symphony orchestra is not
a democracy.

275
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,549
No?

276
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,674
Perhaps there's a difference
of opinion from them.

277
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,438
I can only hope so.

278
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,957
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's hot food waiting for you.

279
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,599
I hope you'll enjoy it.

280
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,238
One concert, maestro. Is it so much?

281
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,231
Don't you see, this is a Panzer move.

282
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:21,594
Divide and conquer.
We can't give in to them.

283
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,677
These people are gangsters.
They're the enemy of everything...

284
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,795
Never mind. It's all right.

285
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:39,199
Go on. Play for him.
It really makes no difference.

286
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,994
Let's get with the group.

287
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,754
Hold this horn as high as you can
and stay with the group.

288
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,952
A hot meal won't kill you.

289
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,148
It just might.

290
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:10,997
- I can understand your point of view...
- Go look after your wife.

291
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,278
Go sing for your supper.

292
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,950
The general seems
terribly friendly for an enemy.

293
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,436
Let's not kid ourselves. The general's
the kind that wants what he wants.

294
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,718
That makes him so different?
I know what I want. I want to live.

295
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,158
I don't want to die. Let's play
for him. What does it matter?

296
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,477
Poor Mr. Evans, he must be freezing.

297
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,596
I bet he's warm as toast.

298
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,753
He's got his burning ego
to keep him company.

299
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,394
You heard him, Victor.
The rest of us aren't important.

300
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:34,153
It's a fight of two vanities.
Why should we get in the crossfire?

301
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,270
Mind the bow exactly as I would,
you understand?

302
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,668
<i>Urgent</i>, <i>for colonel Arndt.</i>

303
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,669
<i>One moment.</i>

304
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,629
<i>- Are you sure E</i>v<i>ans hasn't gone?</i>
<i>- Completely.</i>

305
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,109
<i>What does he want?</i>

306
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,994
<i>An urgent message</i>
<i>from Berlin to Colonel Arndt.</i>

307
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,229
<i>Gi</i>v<i>e it to me.</i>

308
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,798
T<i>his is incredible.</i>

309
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,000
<i>- Where is the Colonel?</i>
<i>- In the motor pool</i>, <i>general.</i>

310
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,035
<i>Simply incredible.</i>

311
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,876
<i>Nothing else.</i>
<i>Not you.</i>

312
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,599
<i>- Is this the full message he sent?</i>
<i>- Yes</i>, <i>general.</i>

313
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,119
<i>Wonderful.</i>

314
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,479
Listen to this.

315
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,832
"This division authorized
to make personal exceptions

316
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,469
to prisoner policy as
practiced by all other combat units

317
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,590
throughout this present offensive?"

318
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,398
He's given Berlin the choice
of one possible answer.

319
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:18,633
I thought only Dr. Goebbels put
words into the mouth of High Command.

320
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:13,833
Your concept
of the Shubert is most adequate.

321
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,232
But my desire is
for Mr. Evans interpretation.

322
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,755
May I?

323
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,999
A lovely rehearsal.

324
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,918
But make no mistake.

325
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,552
My concert must be played under
the baton of Lionel Evans.

326
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,676
I suggest you prevail upon
your maestro to conduct you.

327
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,229
If he will not, you, his musicians

328
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,079
have no function.

329
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,711
And no reason for being.

330
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,919
He's going to kill us.

331
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,679
No, it's Evans who's killing us.

332
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,036
You were right. That
egomaniac expects us to die for him.

333
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,713
And for those soldiers.

334
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,113
Calm down.

335
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,790
Just a minute now. Calm down.

336
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,396
I'll get him in here if I have
to drag him.

337
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,951
Wish me luck. I'm about to do my
imitation of a team of wild horses.

338
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,753
You're not good at imitations.
I'm going alone.

339
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:12,876
Wait. What'll you take with you? A
copy of "remembrance of things past?"

340
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:27,717
Forgive me.
I'm just feeling like a husband.

341
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,115
All right. We'll keep rehearsing.

342
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,558
What's Victor conducting with,
a baseball bat?

343
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,953
Could be.
General Schiller broke the baton.

344
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,476
Remind me
to send him a thank you note.

345
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,353
Unless you come to the chapel
and personally conduct the orchestra

346
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,518
he's going to kill us all.
This stubbornness of yours

347
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:36,038
...is endangering the lives
of 70 people. I know what's at stake.

348
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,315
- Then come back with me.
- No.

349
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,636
This must rank among
life's major ironies.

350
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:55,992
The romantic music professor still
holds the power of life and death

351
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:00,159
over the naive young cellist. That
was always my private portrait of us.

352
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:04,433
Two people in a perfume ad who
never did see things clearly.

353
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,913
Neither did I. You had nice legs
that tended to blur the vision.

354
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,515
I still have nice legs. If we must
die, we should be honest about it.

355
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,758
Fine, let's be honest
about why we shouldn't live, too.

356
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:21,392
I was afraid up in the rarefied
atmosphere I wouldn't breathe.

357
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,118
Perhaps you could have learned.

358
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,355
Perhaps.

359
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,117
You're freezing.

360
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:22,791
Lionel, come back. Please come back.

361
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,715
Are those the terms, Mrs. Rice?

362
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,838
I come back to the nice warm chapel

363
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,511
and I conduct a nice warm concert
in honor of Schiller?

364
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,437
Is that the deal that
Victor authorized you to make?

365
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,513
You husband missed his calling.
He'd have made a marvelous pimp.

366
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,791
You bastard.

367
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,439
Victor didn't send me here.
It was my own idea.

368
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,430
Like every idea I had concerning you,
it was a miserable flop.

369
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,433
No, I have to see the general.
There are American soldiers in there.

370
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:21,316
Get me someone who speaks English.
I have information.

371
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,153
Can you speak English?

372
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:31,156
Please, let me go to the general.
Please help me!

373
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,953
Lionel, I'm frightened.
Please help us.

374
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,198
All right.

375
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,439
But we've still got
to buy some time somehow.

376
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,876
And it's a seller's market.

377
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:42,717
If we could get up there, we
could get a fix on guard changes.

378
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,313
Knowing them, they'd never change it.

379
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:49,958
Maybe their passion for
routine can help get you out of here.

380
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,755
Then we've got to hope
for being rescued.

381
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,355
<i>- More coffee?</i>
<i>- No</i>, <i>thanks.</i>

382
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:14,756
Name's Chaminant. Belgian peasant.
Claims to be with us, but who knows?

383
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:19,431
Probably has a collection of flags
at home. For each possible conqueror.

384
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,915
Gentlemen.

385
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:31,953
Oklahoma's pretty flat.
I never got much practice.

386
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:35,874
In civilian life, I was an
English instructor. Not a human fly.

387
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,713
Well, it's up to one of you.

388
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:55,193
Wait a minute. We can't take a chance.

389
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,759
If this had fallen from higher up,
it'd sounded like a bomb.

390
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:04,118
They might even have a man posted
the other side of that wall.

391
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,830
Good acoustics has drawbacks.

392
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,918
Lieutenant, hide in the horn section.

393
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,597
This chapel was made
for the sound of a full orchestra.

394
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,879
Let's rub the general's nose in it.
Let's try the Tchaikovsky.

395
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,477
Not yet.
There's a good loud part coming up.

396
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,111
There's you cue, Calloway.

397
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,630
- Is that Evans?
- I think so.

398
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,749
Take a look.

399
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,719
Once again, please. From bar 19.

400
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,673
This time horns,
give me a stronger attack.

401
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,234
This music is sensual,
not pornographic.

402
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:13,035
You are very young.
You must be an excellent musician.

403
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,559
May I tell general Schiller when
you will perform this concert?

404
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,636
Yes. Never.

405
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:26,637
I rehearse my musicians the way you
oil your guns. To keep them sharp.

406
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,233
Nothing more.

407
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,113
I would like to hear you play.

408
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:43,473
Trombones, do me the kindness
of referring to bar 47.

409
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:47,354
It calls for one dotted eighth note.

410
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,435
You must be seeing
spots before your eyes.

411
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:51,915
Maestro,

412
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,074
the trombones have always had
a full rest at that point.

413
00:50:55,200 --> 00:51:00,479
Are you telling me what is notated?
I've studied this score for 20 years.

414
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,200
Mr. Long,
would you bring me your music?

415
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:05,835
No.

416
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:09,749
Colonel,
you're interrupting my rehearsal.

417
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,398
I want to hear him play.

418
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:17,678
You must be a great artist to be
kept out of the army at your age.

419
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,073
Bring me your music.

420
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:23,791
You're making extra-musical demands.
As the representative of the union...

421
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,353
Your union be damned!

422
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,278
Our union be damned?
This is the last straw!

423
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,351
Wait until local 802 hears about this!

424
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,029
How about the bus. I'm entitled
to first class transportation.

425
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,195
Be quiet!

426
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,155
Silence!

427
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:08,394
You will play. Now.

428
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:31,635
The integrity of this division is at
stake. The disposal of the prisoners...

429
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,433
This man Evans, is not our prisoner.

430
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,836
We detain him. Nothing more.

431
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:45,833
Only when he acknowledges our
authority, will he be our prisoner.

432
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:49,197
Playing my concert will
be that acknowledgement.

433
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,237
I am not a subtle man, General.

434
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,834
You're right. At last we
have an area or agreement.

435
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:01,631
If you want to serve this division,
do it in a less painful fashion.

436
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:05,749
Find me fuel for my tanks,
not a bullet for my brain.

437
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,918
I will make an urgent request to
Field Marshall Von Runshedt himself.

438
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,760
May I do so, in your name, sir?

439
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:16,475
Naturally.

440
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:22,153
Herr General, when these
musicians have played your concert...

441
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,199
Then they are yours.

442
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:35,071
But if he's not surrendered when we
are ready to resume our offensive?

443
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,519
Then they are yours.

444
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,548
Now, there can't be
more than 35 feet

445
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:00,070
from the tower to the wall outside.

446
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,678
And there's no guard on the wall.

447
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,872
Now, past it there's a few yards
of open space.

448
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,915
Nothing but bombed out timber.
It'd be like a needle in a hay stack.

449
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,150
What it there are guards out side
the wall?

450
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,679
That would be an ugly note,
Lieutenant.

451
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:23,791
You say 30 feet to the wall,
but that's over a drop of 40.

452
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,829
They're infantry, not Air Force.

453
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,035
Yeah, but I'm Oklahoma, don't forget.

454
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:34,434
There's jags and snags in that wall
making it easy to rope as a heifer.

455
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,598
This isn't cow country. Lariats
don't come in Red Cross packages.

456
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,117
Don't be too sure about that.

457
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,391
We just got a Red Cross package,
Sergeant.

458
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:06,395
Lieutenant.

459
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:12,191
Here is your lariat.
At least, the raw materials for it.

460
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:16,992
We'll need men's ties,
women's stockings.

461
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,515
Anything we can braid together
to make a rope.

462
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:43,157
Give me a place to stand,
and I will move the earth.

463
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:48,351
General, it is under standable that
a man, so stubborn, as Evans

464
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,472
- could make one obsessed with...
- There must be a way.

465
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:58,316
With the right point of purchase,
there's leverage for everything.

466
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,553
And for everyone.

467
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:19,956
Rehearsal after supper. The 4th
movement of the Brahms's First.

468
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,190
It would be helpful
if you all studied your scores.

469
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,959
Maestro, does this mean were going
to play the General's concert?

470
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:28,834
The string section in par ticular is
in need of work. Don't neglect it.

471
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:41,235
I'll try to make enough noise
tonight to cover your climb.

472
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:46,429
Once you get us up there.
I hope you got lasso music.

473
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:52,192
I can overplay the climax. It's
the loudest fortissimo there is.

474
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:01,075
Good morning.

475
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,718
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

476
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:12,789
Captain.

477
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:21,358
Good morning, Mr. Evans. I trust
you're enjoying the fresh air?

478
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:25,428
You run a very up-to-date jail,
General. Even to the exercise period.

479
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:28,154
What do you provide in the way
of occupational therapy?

480
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,950
You musicians provide your own.

481
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:36,075
I was disappointed the rehearsal
wasn't preparation for my concert.

482
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,357
Then I'm afraid you're due
for another disappointment to night.

483
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,515
Routine interrogation of prisoners.

484
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:51,357
I know its profitless questioning
your people on military matters,

485
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,877
but I must give our Colonel
Arndt his little victories.

486
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,913
When does my turn come?

487
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,831
I already know about you, Mr. Evans.

488
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:11,033
That's very gallant of you
to let the lady decline.

489
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:16,149
Captain Klingermann's
in vitation was not so routine.

490
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,792
Excuse me. Mrs. Rice.

491
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:40,239
- What did Schiller want?
- Me, I suspect.

492
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,834
For openers,
I was invited to dinner tonight.

493
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,272
Why did you turn him down?

494
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:06,152
Look, the only thing
that can save us is time.

495
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:11,230
Long and Callaway will need time
to break out and send back help.

496
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:16,474
My staying behind
in the wine cellar bought time.

497
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:21,198
Maybe his interest in your
wife will buy us sane more time.

498
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,195
And just who
the hell do you think you are?

499
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:28,308
How can you be sure of my wife's
ability with Schiller's interest?

500
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,597
It's the sort of problem a beautiful
woman's equipped to cope with.

501
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:37,231
Brahms, ladies and gentlemen,
from letter B.

502
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:38,475
<i>Piu andante.</i>

503
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,320
Good luck to you.
We'll be waiting for you.

504
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:26,549
Come in.

505
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:01,752
My husband thinks
I should be wearing a price tag.

506
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,669
Are you?

507
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,197
Depends on what's for sale.

508
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:18,390
Mrs. Rice, I believe we'll have
a delightful evening together.

509
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:43,797
Champagne. No seduction
would be complete without it.

510
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:58,555
Caviar. A late supper. Champagne.

511
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:03,598
The scene is set.

512
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:08,314
Complete to the musicians
behind the screen.

513
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:14,310
Though, I must say, your Maestro
could've made a happier choice.

514
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:19,111
I find it explosive for a scene of
intimacy. Especially the second half.

515
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,752
But I'm sure he has his reasons.

516
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:07,913
I liked your husband's instincts when
you were in the cellar with Evans.

517
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:09,355
What was it?

518
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:12,917
Yes, Schubert's

519
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,872
the Unfinished.

520
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:20,676
Much more suited to the situation.

521
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:28,990
Former lover recalling the past.

522
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:17,349
I wonder how much time we got.
Let's use it.

523
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:03,559
Here, Sergeant, keep me covered.
I see you in the promised land.

524
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:03,755
<i>Bring him.</i>

525
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:52,592
I thought you'd got me up here
to make love to me, not question me.

526
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:59,510
Every military operations
has its secondary target.

527
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:04,590
Moreover, the secondary
often becomes the primary.

528
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:12,439
No thank you, General. That's not
as good an offer as a blind date.

529
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:13,989
Mrs. Rice.

530
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,511
I wouldn't leave just now.

531
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:26,710
I'm not so well acquainted
with the selection to know where

532
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:29,228
exactly The fugue begins.

533
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:34,553
Appropriate. Fugue.

534
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:41,194
The musical passage denoting flight.
It could be dangerous.

535
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:34,993
I don't know. It could've been
that Belgian peasant, Chaminant.

536
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:37,229
No.

537
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:42,350
- Had to be someone in the orchestra.
- Why?

538
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,673
Because General Schiller knew
all about you and me.

539
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:57,196
That's quite a trick. I don't
know all about you and me, myself.

540
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:14,672
I don't want to die,

541
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:18,312
Who does?

542
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:34,557
Aspirin.
The strongest thing I could find.

543
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:40,110
Calloway might make it yet.
We've still got a chance.

544
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,318
Try and get some sleep.

545
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:05,470
Conduct that concert for Schiller.

546
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:13,632
Once I do that, he's won the game.
I'd be signing our death warrant.

547
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:41,755
<i>Gentlemen</i>, <i>take care that</i>
<i>this is distributed</i>, <i>and report.</i>

548
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:48,750
<i>We shall rendez</i>v<i>ous with Rundstedt</i>
<i>troops and attack west to Namur.</i>

549
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:51,390
<i>It'll be much faster</i>
<i>with no prisoners.</i>

550
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:57,153
No prisoners, Herr Arndt.

551
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:00,273
Such a beautiful day.

552
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:05,792
You're a man of unceasing activity
and matchless energy.

553
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:09,310
The new Germany in microcosm.

554
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:14,237
Please delay the execution until
after I have left this even ing.

555
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:15,475
Yes, sir.

556
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:35,515
No. No ersatz.

557
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:08,793
That's Long's gun, isn't it?

558
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:13,115
He round it on Calloway's body,
two kilometers west of here.

559
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:15,316
He stepped on a land mine.

560
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:18,230
There goes the ball game.

561
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:21,512
No. We can still break out of here.

562
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:26,953
They're willing to help us.
They'll stage an attack at 9.

563
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:35,632
A handful of civilians covering for a
bunch of trombones and French horns?

564
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:37,473
We don't stand a chance.

565
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:41,508
As soon as Schiller's tanks are
gassed, the division is pulling out.

566
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,714
Victor, there is no more time left.

567
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,594
Colonel Arndt has
literally dug our graves.

568
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,710
With any luck, a few
of us will make it to the woods.

569
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:16,474
All right,
I will play your damned concert.

570
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:24,992
It's been a delightful game,
doubly delightful for the winning.

571
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:34,595
But my victory puzzles me.

572
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:36,957
Is it mere coincidence

573
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:42,951
the morning after an
attempted escape, you capitulate?

574
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:47,513
- If you don't want the concert...
- Yes, I do, Indeed.

575
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:52,438
But I must ask myself why. Why now?

576
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:58,309
The only answer is you feel last
night's fiasco will lead to reprisal.

577
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:02,951
It might lessen your chances.
Thus anything to delay the inevitable.

578
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:07,873
I've given you what you wanted.
To see me at your feet.

579
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,673
Now, in return,
I want my orchestra set free.

580
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:12,834
Conditions.

581
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:17,750
I want that bus in the yard after,
to take them to the Allied lines.

582
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:19,955
It'll be there.

583
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:21,795
It'll be there.

584
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:28,716
But the Colonel's mass
grave will be there, too.

585
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,148
There's that, too.

586
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:38,558
I don't really have any choice, do I?
but to trust your word?

587
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:43,830
Your proposition was not entirely
satisfactory from my point of view.

588
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:49,112
It hardly puts you at my feet.

589
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:52,039
There is that, too.

590
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:07,153
Our electrical generator comes with,
but I'm prepared to improvise

591
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:08,679
a special lighting
for your performance.

592
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:15,633
A concert here? Poss ible, I suppose.

593
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:20,033
In this hall.
Something Wagnerian would be nice.

594
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:22,071
No. Emphatically, not Wagner.

595
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:24,509
All right, until this evening then,
eight o'clock.

596
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:29,238
We can't possibly be
ready until 8:45.

597
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:32,517
Not with white tie
and all the trimmings.

598
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:36,157
Surely appropriate
for a command performance.

599
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:41,230
I've given orders that the
area be evacuated no later than 9.

600
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:46,796
But if you wish, all right.

601
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:51,069
- 8.45.
- Something Wagnerian then.

602
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:02,718
Now, the Partisans are supposed
to attack at 9 o'clock.

603
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:06,270
That should be during the
opening selection, the Tanhmauser.

604
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:09,433
As soon as the firing starts.
we rush Schiller.

605
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:14,078
An officer with a gun in his back'll
give us some bargaining positions.

606
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:17,755
Let me have it,
you don't know anything about it.

607
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:19,518
Put it on safety.

608
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:25,830
Have each section leader brief
his people at the last moment.

609
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:28,952
It's still possible
for word to get back to the Germans.

610
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:34,070
- May I, until after the performance?
- Maybe Schiller meant it.

611
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:37,239
- Maybe he will let us go.
- Make no mistake.

612
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:40,716
Hers every intention of murdering us.
as soon as he gets his concert.

613
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:44,315
He has his orders. At nine o'clock.

614
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:59,070
- May god be with us.
- I'm sure he will.

615
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:11,996
Lionel, forgive me. I was wrong.

616
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:14,754
About what?

617
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:18,591
About you for one thing.

618
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:24,432
This isn't real, you know.
This is suspended animation.

619
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:27,752
Furniture's on the ceiling.
The world's upside down.

620
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:32,872
When it's over, you are
a married woman with a husband.

621
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:34,839
That's what's real.

622
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,513
Ladies and gentlemen,

623
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:50,395
let us practice our profession.

624
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:19,790
I apologize for the light attendance.

625
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:25,675
Your hour for con certizing finds
most of my Officers in the field.

626
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:28,908
Captain Klingermann
and I will be your audience.

627
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:45,795
<i>Back to headquarters.</i>

628
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:42,673
<i>Detail</i>, <i>attention.</i>

629
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:56,588
The Concert is not over, General.

630
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:05,314
I do not wish to be here
for the end of it.

631
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:20,395
Let him finish his last performance.

632
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:55,349
Got a light?

633
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:58,149
Jordan!

634
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:07,353
What was the next selection? Verdi.

635
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:12,550
Yes, the Verdi, everyone.

636
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:15,989
There's no one out there.
The Germans have gone.

637
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:20,995
- It's not 9 o'clock yet.
- Schiller meant it. He's letting us go!

638
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:22,991
- The bus is still there, let's go!
- No.

639
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,912
- There's no guard. Let's go.
- Not till we attack.

640
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:28,832
Let's go!

641
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:41,030
<i>Hurry. Don't let them escape!</i>

642
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:46,958
<i>O</i>v<i>er there in front of the ditch.</i>
<i>See if anyone is left inside.</i>

643
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:50,312
<i>Section fall in.</i>

644
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:57,277
<i>Bring him with the rest!</i>

645
01:32:57,920 --> 01:32:58,955
Damn it.

646
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:01,309
<i>Firing squad!</i>

647
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:05,235
<i>Load your weapons!</i>

648
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:08,029
<i>Aim!</i>

649
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:10,839
No, no, you can't.

650
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:14,709
Not me. You promised me.

651
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:15,909
Silence.

652
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:17,998
You said you'd save me.

653
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:19,309
Back in line.

654
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:21,515
<i>Fire.</i>

655
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:26,749
<i>Ready.</i>

656
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:28,835
<i>Aim.</i>

657
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:36,834
Get in the trench.

658
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:16,837
Let me have that. Give me that.

659
01:34:17,080 --> 01:34:19,833
You take this.
You know how to handle the thing.

660
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:22,351
Will you do what I say?

661
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:26,399
Let me thru.

662
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:28,153
Follow me.

663
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:29,549
Let me thru.

664
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:36,910
Let me through here.

665
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:44,029
Follow me.

666
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:04,509
<i>Attention.</i>

667
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:13,317
<i>Mo</i>v<i>e on</i>, <i>soldiers. You'</i>v<i>e all seen</i>
<i>corpses before. Come on</i>, <i>get back.</i>

668
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:18,239
The work of Partisans.

669
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:22,516
Herr General, the di rective
from Berlin concerning prisoners.

670
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:24,955
If any of those musicians
should escape...

671
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:27,435
They will not.

672
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:30,038
Let's get back to the Castle.

673
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:39,913
Lionel, get on the bus.

674
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:44,398
You've got 70 people
on that bus. Go, damn it!

675
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,035
<i>A torch.</i>

676
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:05,834
<i>Bury the bodies.</i>

677
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:10,310
<i>Yes</i>, <i>Colonel. Bury the bodies.</i>

678
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:00,074
Mr. Evans...

679
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:02,876
you've cost us a great deal of time.

680
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:05,039
And trouble.

681
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:08,234
Colonel Arndt?

682
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:10,269
General.

683
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,353
Where is the orchestra?

684
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:20,354
The others got away, temporarily.
But not the prize.

685
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:50,878
Saving the honors for your self,
General?

686
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:54,628
More or less.

687
01:38:58,240 --> 01:38:59,275
General!

688
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:03,748
Wait outside.

689
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:08,989
A musician was still alive.
He killed Colonel Arndt.

690
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:11,038
I was forced to shoot him.

691
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:13,958
I'll join you immediately.

692
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:16,075
Yes, sir, General.

693
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:21,359
You heard what I said?

694
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:28,632
I am a vain man, and killing you
would make me no better than that.

695
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:31,671
I don't believe that's the reason.

696
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:40,794
I think that if any
of my orchestra had escaped

697
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:45,518
and Arndt was still alive,
he'd have had some thing on you.

698
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:53,800
Curiously enough, both reasons,
yours and mine, are correct.

699
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:05,791
Perhaps your countrymen will reach
here, before you reach them. Goodbye.

700
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:08,153
Goodbye, General.

701
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:15,271
Ours was a conflict of moralities,
was it not?

702
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:18,234
Each of us
thought his own the greater.

703
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:25,431
But quoting Napoleon, "Morality is on
the side of the heaviest Artillery."

704
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:28,515
And what happened to Napoleon?

705
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:49,389
<i>General!</i>

706
01:40:50,305 --> 01:40:56,942
