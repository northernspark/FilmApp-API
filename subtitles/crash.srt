2
00:02:49,616 --> 00:02:51,675
It's the sense of touch.

3
00:02:53,253 --> 00:02:54,515
What?

4
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:00,490
Any real city, you walk, you know?

5
00:03:00,594 --> 00:03:04,360
You brush past people.
People bump into you.

6
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:07,523
In L.A., nobody touches you.

7
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,535
We're always behind
this metal and glass.

8
00:03:15,008 --> 00:03:17,909
I think we miss
that touch so much

9
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:21,970
that we crash into each other
just so we can feel something.

10
00:03:24,017 --> 00:03:26,178
You guys okay?

11
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,378
I think he hit his head.

12
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:31,257
You don't think that's true?

13
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:33,291
Stay in your car.

14
00:03:33,393 --> 00:03:36,191
Graham, I think
we got rear-ended.

15
00:03:36,296 --> 00:03:38,355
I think we spun around twice.

16
00:03:38,465 --> 00:03:43,425
And somewhere in there,
one of us lost our frame of reference.

17
00:03:43,537 --> 00:03:45,937
And I'm gonna go look for it.

18
00:03:47,974 --> 00:03:50,772
- Calm down, ma'am.
- I am calm!

19
00:03:50,877 --> 00:03:52,970
I need to see your registration
and insurance.

20
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:56,014
Why? It's not my fault!
It's her fault! She do this!

21
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:56,911
My fault?

22
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,915
Ma'am, you really need
to wait in your vehicle.

23
00:03:59,019 --> 00:03:59,951
My fault?

24
00:04:00,053 --> 00:04:02,521
Stop in middle of street!
Mexicans no know how to drive.

25
00:04:02,656 --> 00:04:04,624
She "blake" too fast.

26
00:04:04,724 --> 00:04:07,420
I "blake" too fast? I "blake" too fast.

27
00:04:07,527 --> 00:04:10,587
- I'm sorry you no see my "blake" lights.
- Ma'am.

28
00:04:10,697 --> 00:04:14,133
See, I stop when I see a long line of cars
stopped in front of me.

29
00:04:14,234 --> 00:04:17,203
Maybe you see over
steering wheel, you "blake" too!

30
00:04:17,304 --> 00:04:18,293
Ma'am!

31
00:04:18,405 --> 00:04:20,669
I call immigration on you.
Look what you do my car.

32
00:04:20,774 --> 00:04:24,505
Officer, can you please write in your report how
shocked I am to be hit by an Asian driver!

33
00:04:24,611 --> 00:04:27,705
- Ma'am!
- Ma'am, no. See, Detective...

34
00:04:32,752 --> 00:04:36,119
All right. You've got to calm down.

35
00:04:43,763 --> 00:04:46,027
Hey, Detective! Nice entrance.

36
00:04:46,132 --> 00:04:47,861
Fuck you.

37
00:04:50,971 --> 00:04:52,905
Hey, you okay?

38
00:04:54,074 --> 00:04:55,268
I'm freezin'.

39
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:58,139
Shit. I heard it might snow.

40
00:04:58,244 --> 00:05:00,542
- Get outta here.
- That's what I heard.

41
00:05:00,647 --> 00:05:03,343
- You got a smoke?
- Nah. I quit.

42
00:05:03,483 --> 00:05:06,145
Yeah, me too.

43
00:05:06,286 --> 00:05:08,754
- What do you got?
- Dead kid.

44
00:05:19,065 --> 00:05:20,327
Hey, Bob.

45
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:05,242
You get one free box of ammunition.
What kind do you want?

46
00:06:18,124 --> 00:06:21,116
Yo, Osama! Plan a jihad
on your own time.

47
00:06:21,227 --> 00:06:23,821
What do you want?

48
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:28,066
Are you making insult at me?

49
00:06:28,168 --> 00:06:31,069
Am I making insult "at" you?
Is that the closest you can come to English?

50
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:34,106
- Yes, I speak English! I am American citizen.
- Oh, God, here we go.

51
00:06:34,207 --> 00:06:36,573
I have right like you.
I have right to buy gun.

52
00:06:36,676 --> 00:06:38,803
Not in my store, you don't!
Andy, get him outta here now!

53
00:06:38,912 --> 00:06:41,073
- Go wait in the car.
- Now. Get out!

54
00:06:42,482 --> 00:06:44,074
You're an ignorant man!

55
00:06:44,217 --> 00:06:45,809
Yeah, I'm ignorant?
You're liberating my country.

56
00:06:45,952 --> 00:06:48,978
And I'm flying 747 s into your mud huts
and incinerating your friends?

57
00:06:49,122 --> 00:06:52,114
- Get the fuck out!
- No, you get the fuck out!

58
00:06:52,258 --> 00:06:53,885
No, don't touch me!
He cheat me!

59
00:06:53,993 --> 00:06:55,893
- Andy, now!
- Let's go.

60
00:06:55,995 --> 00:06:57,462
Okay.

61
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:03,865
You can give me the gun
or give me back the money.

62
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:08,031
And I am really hoping
for the money.

63
00:07:11,845 --> 00:07:14,405
- What kind of ammunition do you want?
- Whatever fits.

64
00:07:14,514 --> 00:07:16,505
We got a lot of kinds.

65
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:19,015
We got long colts,
short colts, bull heads,

66
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:21,644
flat nose, hollow points,
wide cutters,

67
00:07:21,788 --> 00:07:25,224
and a dozen more that'll fit
any size hole.

68
00:07:25,325 --> 00:07:29,091
Just depends upon how
much bang you can handle.

69
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,396
I'll take the ones
in the red box.

70
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:39,069
- You know what those are?
- Can I have them?

71
00:07:49,215 --> 00:07:53,379
Did you see any white people waitin' an hour
and 32 minutes for a plate of spaghetti?

72
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,953
And how many cups of coffee
did we get?

73
00:07:55,054 --> 00:07:57,989
You don't drink coffee
and I didn't want any.

74
00:07:58,091 --> 00:08:01,788
Man, that woman poured cup after cup
to every single white person around us.

75
00:08:01,895 --> 00:08:04,955
But did she even ask you
if you wanted any?

76
00:08:05,064 --> 00:08:07,032
We didn't get any coffee that you didn't want
and I didn't order,

77
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:09,363
and that's evidence
of racial discrimination?

78
00:08:09,469 --> 00:08:11,460
Did you notice
that our waitress was black?

79
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:14,039
And black women don't think
in stereotypes?

80
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,574
You tell me.
When was the last time you met one

81
00:08:16,676 --> 00:08:18,940
who didn't think she knew
everything about your lazy ass

82
00:08:19,045 --> 00:08:20,910
before you even opened
your mouth, huh?

83
00:08:21,014 --> 00:08:23,278
That waitress sized us up
in two seconds.

84
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:27,182
We're black, and black people don't tip.
She wasn't gonna waste her time.

85
00:08:27,287 --> 00:08:30,256
Somebody like that? Nothing you can do
to change their mind.

86
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,824
How much did you leave?

87
00:08:32,926 --> 00:08:34,826
You expect me to pay
for that kind of service?

88
00:08:35,795 --> 00:08:39,322
What? What the fuck
is you laughin' at, man?

89
00:08:39,432 --> 00:08:42,458
I'm seriously starting to think
that you're jealous of Karen.

90
00:08:42,569 --> 00:08:46,767
Hardly. I'd just like to see you get through
a meal without calling her or anyone else.

91
00:08:46,873 --> 00:08:51,401
Okay, no more phone calls.
As a matter of fact, you can hold the battery.

92
00:08:51,511 --> 00:08:53,342
Okay?

93
00:08:54,814 --> 00:08:57,146
Ten bucks says
she calls you in the car.

94
00:08:57,283 --> 00:08:59,945
Wait, wait, wait.
See what that woman just did?

95
00:09:00,086 --> 00:09:02,020
- You see that?
- She's cold.

96
00:09:02,155 --> 00:09:05,488
She got colder
as soon as she saw us.

97
00:09:05,592 --> 00:09:08,720
- Ah, come on, don't start.
- Man, look around you, man.

98
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:12,286
You couldn't find a whiter, safer
or better-lit part of this city right now.

99
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:14,298
But yet this white woman
sees two black guys

100
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,096
who look like UCLA students
strolling down the sidewalk,

101
00:09:17,203 --> 00:09:19,637
and her reaction
is blind fear?

102
00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:22,230
Look at us, dawg.
Are we dressed like gangbangers?

103
00:09:22,342 --> 00:09:25,675
Huh? No.
Do we look threatening? No.

104
00:09:25,778 --> 00:09:29,680
Fact. If anybody should be
scared around here, it's us!

105
00:09:29,816 --> 00:09:33,752
We're the only two black faces surrounded by
a sea of over-caffeinated white people

106
00:09:33,887 --> 00:09:36,583
patrolled by
the trigger-happy L.A.P.D.

107
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:40,250
So you tell me.
Why aren't we scared?

108
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,555
'Cause we got guns?

109
00:09:42,662 --> 00:09:44,562
You could be right.

110
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:49,763
- Get the fuck outta the car!
- Gimme the keys!

111
00:09:49,869 --> 00:09:52,599
- Hurry up! Get down!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

112
00:09:52,705 --> 00:09:56,937
- No, no! Please!
- Don't look at me! Turn around!

113
00:09:57,043 --> 00:10:00,570
- Come on! Go!
- We're fine! Just keep moving!

114
00:10:05,785 --> 00:10:10,222
No, no, no! Take that voodoo-assed thing
off of there right now.

115
00:10:10,356 --> 00:10:12,654
I know you just didn't call
Saint Christopher voodoo.

116
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:14,624
Man's the patron saint
of travelers, dawg.

117
00:10:14,727 --> 00:10:17,594
You had a conversation
with God, huh? What did God say?

118
00:10:17,697 --> 00:10:22,191
"Go forth, my son, and leave big slobbery
suction rings on every dashboard you find"?

119
00:10:22,302 --> 00:10:23,394
Why the hell do you do that?

120
00:10:23,503 --> 00:10:26,370
Look at the way your crazy ass drive,
then ask me again.

121
00:10:34,113 --> 00:10:36,638
Chevy pickup and Mercedes
driving north on Balboa.

122
00:10:36,783 --> 00:10:39,445
Pickup cuts in front. Driver of the Mercedes
gets pissed, pulls a gun.

123
00:10:39,585 --> 00:10:42,247
Doesn't realize the guy in the pickup
is a cop coming off shift.

124
00:10:42,388 --> 00:10:44,253
This Barry Gibb dude is a cop?

125
00:10:44,357 --> 00:10:46,791
Yeah. Name's Conklin.
He's a narc out of Wilshire.

126
00:10:46,893 --> 00:10:48,758
I got the Mercedes.

127
00:10:49,662 --> 00:10:53,291
Mercedes takes a shot at him.
Detective Conklin returns fire. One shot.

128
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,960
Mercedes rolls to a stop. Driver opens the
door, falls out dead.

129
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,868
He looks very relaxed
for just having shot somebody.

130
00:10:59,973 --> 00:11:01,770
He says he kept tryin'
to drive away.

131
00:11:01,874 --> 00:11:03,933
The Mercedes kept pulling up next to him,
screaming, waving a gun.

132
00:11:04,043 --> 00:11:06,637
Shot back in self-defense.

133
00:11:06,746 --> 00:11:10,944
- Anybody actually see who shot first?
- They just heard two bangs.

134
00:11:11,084 --> 00:11:12,915
Find me a witness.

135
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,864
That is a nice gun.

136
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:34,531
The car's registered
to a Cindy Bradley.

137
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,505
And that's not Cindy.

138
00:11:36,609 --> 00:11:39,407
That is a William Lewis.

139
00:11:39,512 --> 00:11:42,481
Found under the front seat.
Hollywood Division.

140
00:11:46,986 --> 00:11:50,922
Looks like Detective Conklin
shot himself the wrong nigger.

141
00:12:02,468 --> 00:12:05,596
- How much longer are you gonna be?
- This is the last one.

142
00:12:05,705 --> 00:12:06,694
Thank you.

143
00:12:16,382 --> 00:12:18,748
You don't think reporters listen to police calls?

144
00:12:18,851 --> 00:12:20,648
I need to talk to you
for a second.

145
00:12:22,522 --> 00:12:24,990
You just give me a minute,
all right?

146
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:27,957
- Find Flanagan, will you? Now.
- Yes, sir.

147
00:12:29,796 --> 00:12:30,785
Yes, honey?

148
00:12:30,897 --> 00:12:32,728
I want the locks changed again in the morning.

149
00:12:32,832 --> 00:12:36,563
You want... Why don't you just go lie down?
Have you checked on James?

150
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:39,604
Of course. I've checked on him every five
minutes since we've been home.

151
00:12:39,705 --> 00:12:43,937
Do not patronize me. I want the locks
changed again in the morning.

152
00:12:44,744 --> 00:12:47,338
It's okay.
Just go to bed.

153
00:12:47,447 --> 00:12:50,939
You know, didn't I just ask you
not to treat me like a child?

154
00:12:51,084 --> 00:12:55,145
I'm sorry, Miss Jean.
Is okay I go home now?

155
00:12:55,288 --> 00:12:56,778
It's fine. Thank you
very much for staying.

156
00:12:56,923 --> 00:12:58,550
You're welcome. No problem.
Good night.

157
00:12:58,658 --> 00:13:01,422
- Good night.
- We'll see you tomorrow.

158
00:13:01,527 --> 00:13:05,623
I would like the locks
changed again in the morning.

159
00:13:05,731 --> 00:13:08,063
And you might mention
that we'd appreciate it

160
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:10,362
if next time they didn't send
a gang member.

161
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,768
- A gang member? You mean that kid in there?
- Yes, yes.

162
00:13:12,872 --> 00:13:16,569
Yes. The guy with the shaved head,
the pants around his ass, the prison tattoo.

163
00:13:16,676 --> 00:13:17,904
- Those are not prison tattoos.
- Oh, really?

164
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,308
And he's not gonna sell our key
to one of his gangbanger friends

165
00:13:20,413 --> 00:13:22,779
- the moment he is out our door?
- We've had a tough night.

166
00:13:22,915 --> 00:13:26,578
- It'd be best if you went upstairs...
- And wait for them to break in?

167
00:13:26,719 --> 00:13:30,155
I just had a gun pointed in my face.

168
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:31,256
You lower your voice!

169
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:34,257
And it was my fault
because I knew it was gonna happen.

170
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,851
But if a white person sees two black men
walking towards her,

171
00:13:36,963 --> 00:13:40,524
and she turns and walks in the other direction,
she's a racist, right?

172
00:13:40,633 --> 00:13:43,227
Well, I got scared
and I didn't say anything.

173
00:13:43,336 --> 00:13:45,600
And ten seconds later
I had a gun in my face!

174
00:13:45,705 --> 00:13:49,903
I am telling you. Your amigo in there is gonna
sell our key to one of his homies.

175
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:54,503
And this time it'd be really fucking great
if you acted like you actually gave a shit!

176
00:14:22,441 --> 00:14:24,636
All right, what have we got?
Talk to me, Karen.

177
00:14:24,744 --> 00:14:26,678
Flanagan doesn't think
anybody has the story yet.

178
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:29,179
I'm the goddamn
District Attorney of Los Angeles.

179
00:14:29,315 --> 00:14:32,478
If my car gets jacked,
it's gonna make news.

180
00:14:32,618 --> 00:14:34,415
Fuck!

181
00:14:35,621 --> 00:14:37,885
Why did these guys
have to be black?

182
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,651
I mean, why?

183
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:41,420
No matter how we spin this,

184
00:14:41,527 --> 00:14:44,587
I'm either gonna lose the black vote
or I'm gonna lose the law-and-order vote.

185
00:14:44,697 --> 00:14:48,258
You're worrying too much. You have
a lot of support in the black community.

186
00:14:49,969 --> 00:14:52,494
All right. If we can't duck this thing,
we're gonna have to neutralize it.

187
00:14:52,605 --> 00:14:57,167
What we need is a picture of me
pinning a medal on a black man.

188
00:14:57,276 --> 00:14:59,107
Bruce?

189
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:02,006
The firefighter.

190
00:15:02,148 --> 00:15:05,083
The one who saved the camp or something.
Northridge. What's his name?

191
00:15:05,184 --> 00:15:06,310
He's Iraqi.

192
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,517
He's Iraqi?
Well, he looks black.

193
00:15:10,623 --> 00:15:14,423
He's dark-skinned, sir, but he's Iraqi.
His name's Saddam Khahum.

194
00:15:14,527 --> 00:15:17,519
Saddam?
His-His name's Saddam?

195
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,726
That's real good, Bruce. I'm gonna pin a medal
on an Iraqi named Saddam.

196
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:24,029
Give yourself a raise, will you?

197
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:29,769
It's been good
doing business with you.

198
00:15:30,643 --> 00:15:34,010
- How soon can I have them?
- I'm picking them up right now.

199
00:15:34,113 --> 00:15:37,742
Look, you're not listening to me.
This is an emergency.

200
00:15:37,883 --> 00:15:40,750
I keep telling you he's in pain.
He can't sleep.

201
00:15:40,853 --> 00:15:44,755
Mr. Ryan, your father has been to the clinic
three times in the last month.

202
00:15:44,857 --> 00:15:50,159
He is being treated for a urinary tract infection.
That is by no means an emergency.

203
00:15:50,263 --> 00:15:54,393
If you have any more questions
about your HMO plan, why don't you

204
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,061
make an appointment to come in between
10:00 and 4:00, Monday through Friday.

205
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,229
What does my father do
about sleeping tonight?

206
00:16:00,306 --> 00:16:02,137
I don't know.
I'm not a doctor.

207
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:05,041
- I wanna talk to your supervisor.
- I am my supervisor!

208
00:16:05,144 --> 00:16:07,044
- What is your name?
- Shaniqua Johnson.

209
00:16:07,146 --> 00:16:09,842
Shaniqua.
Big fucking surprise that is.

210
00:16:26,165 --> 00:16:28,531
Bronson Avenue, Westwood.

211
00:16:28,634 --> 00:16:31,330
Vehicle is described as a black
late-model Lincoln Navigator.

212
00:16:31,437 --> 00:16:35,965
California plate
4 Peter Charles Ida 315.

213
00:16:36,075 --> 00:16:39,511
Suspects are two black males,
approximately 20 years of age.

214
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,944
That's not it.

215
00:16:50,189 --> 00:16:52,123
That's not the vehicle, John.
The plates don't match.

216
00:16:52,224 --> 00:16:55,955
The driver's gotta be 40. Nobody jacks a car
and takes it to Studio City.

217
00:17:01,033 --> 00:17:03,331
They were doin' something.

218
00:17:47,646 --> 00:17:49,045
Enthusiastic.

219
00:17:50,282 --> 00:17:52,409
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em, please.

220
00:17:52,551 --> 00:17:56,783
I'm gonna need to see
your driver's license and registration.

221
00:17:56,889 --> 00:17:59,050
No problem.

222
00:17:59,158 --> 00:18:03,026
I'm gonna have to reach inside the glove
compartment to get the registration.

223
00:18:03,129 --> 00:18:05,495
- Is that okay?
- Nice and slow, please.

224
00:18:05,598 --> 00:18:06,963
Okay.

225
00:18:11,103 --> 00:18:13,298
How are you tonight, Officer?

226
00:18:13,406 --> 00:18:15,306
Excellent.

227
00:18:17,109 --> 00:18:18,838
Here you go.

228
00:18:22,148 --> 00:18:24,207
Stay inside the vehicle, please.

229
00:18:33,626 --> 00:18:35,685
Let's do it again right now.

230
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:38,554
Step outta the car, please, sir.

231
00:18:38,664 --> 00:18:42,361
Wait a minute, Officer.
I haven't been drinking or anything.

232
00:18:42,468 --> 00:18:44,698
Then we shouldn't have a problem.

233
00:18:44,804 --> 00:18:47,398
He doesn't drink.
He's a Buddhist, for Christ's sake.

234
00:18:47,506 --> 00:18:49,406
No, it's okay.

235
00:18:49,508 --> 00:18:50,998
It's fine.

236
00:18:56,081 --> 00:18:58,072
Step onto the sidewalk, sir.

237
00:18:59,685 --> 00:19:01,880
That's good. Right there.

238
00:19:03,622 --> 00:19:05,146
Look at me.

239
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:07,992
I want you to stand
on your right foot.

240
00:19:08,093 --> 00:19:12,257
Touch your nose
with the index finger of your left hand.

241
00:19:16,635 --> 00:19:18,660
I told you he doesn't drink.

242
00:19:18,771 --> 00:19:21,968
Ma'am, I'm only gonna tell you
one time to stay in the vehicle.

243
00:19:22,074 --> 00:19:24,668
- Ma'am?
- Honey, honey, I'm okay. I got this.

244
00:19:24,777 --> 00:19:28,144
Don't you "ma'am" me. Who the hell
do you think you're talking to?

245
00:19:28,247 --> 00:19:31,444
Look, Officer, my wife
has had a couple of drinks...

246
00:19:31,584 --> 00:19:34,553
Both of you, turn around. Put your hands on
top of your head and interlock your fingers.

247
00:19:34,653 --> 00:19:36,450
Wait. We're only a block away from our house.

248
00:19:36,555 --> 00:19:38,955
Hands on your head.
Interlock your fingers.

249
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:42,118
- Hands on your head. Interlock your fingers.
- I'm a television director.

250
00:19:42,228 --> 00:19:44,992
Me and my wife were just coming home
from an awards show.

251
00:19:45,097 --> 00:19:47,429
Take your hands off him.
He's done nothing wrong.

252
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:49,626
Put your hands on top
of your head, ma'am.

253
00:19:49,735 --> 00:19:51,225
- Do what he says.
- Fuck you!

254
00:19:51,337 --> 00:19:52,304
Put your hands...

255
00:19:52,404 --> 00:19:55,202
And you keep
your filthy fucking hands off me!

256
00:19:55,307 --> 00:19:56,934
You motherfucking pig!

257
00:19:57,042 --> 00:20:00,569
- Just stop talking!
- That's quite a mouth you have.

258
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:02,408
Of course you know that.

259
00:20:02,548 --> 00:20:06,348
Fuck you! That's what
this is all about, isn't it?

260
00:20:06,452 --> 00:20:09,250
You thought you saw a white woman blowin' a
black man. That drove your cracker ass crazy.

261
00:20:09,355 --> 00:20:11,084
Will you just shut
your fucking mouth!

262
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:14,250
I'd listen to your husband, ma'am.

263
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,658
Put your legs open.

264
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:22,890
Do you have any guns or knives
or anything I might get stuck with?

265
00:20:23,002 --> 00:20:25,493
I'm wearing a cocktail dress.
What do you think?

266
00:20:25,604 --> 00:20:27,731
You'd be surprised some of the places
I've found weapons.

267
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,738
He's clean.

268
00:20:30,276 --> 00:20:34,144
What do you think we should do about this,
Mr. Thayer?

269
00:20:35,014 --> 00:20:38,347
My partner and I just witnessed your wife
performing fellatio on you

270
00:20:38,484 --> 00:20:40,611
while you were operating
a motor vehicle.

271
00:20:40,753 --> 00:20:44,849
That's reckless endangerment,
which incidentally is a felony.

272
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:51,455
We could charge your wife with lewd conduct
and performing a sexual act in public.

273
00:20:53,699 --> 00:20:56,429
You say you're a block from home.

274
00:20:56,535 --> 00:20:58,901
We could use our discretion

275
00:20:59,004 --> 00:21:01,029
and let you go with a warning,

276
00:21:01,974 --> 00:21:04,408
or we could cuff you and put you
in the back of the car.

277
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:10,114
What do you think
we should do, sir?

278
00:21:17,623 --> 00:21:20,854
Look, we're sorry, and

279
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,489
we would appreciate if you would just
let us go with a warning, please.

280
00:21:31,103 --> 00:21:33,799
The man's apologizing, Tommy.

281
00:21:33,906 --> 00:21:37,000
I think we can let him go.
Don't you?

282
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,270
Yeah.

283
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,644
All right.

284
00:21:44,817 --> 00:21:46,284
You can go.

285
00:21:55,828 --> 00:21:58,126
You folks
drive safe now, huh?

286
00:22:32,364 --> 00:22:34,730
Let's go, Tommy.

287
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:44,775
It won't close.

288
00:22:46,111 --> 00:22:47,078
I can do that.

289
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:49,079
Dad, you couldn't even get it open.

290
00:22:49,181 --> 00:22:51,172
Have respect for your father.
Give me the gun!

291
00:22:52,985 --> 00:22:55,613
Here. Now you can shoot
anybody you want.

292
00:22:55,754 --> 00:22:58,518
Dorri, that man
could've killed your mother.

293
00:22:58,624 --> 00:23:01,991
You think I should let crazy people
do what they want to us?

294
00:23:02,094 --> 00:23:03,584
Farhad, it won't close.

295
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,634
Dorri, you should be at work.

296
00:23:22,181 --> 00:23:24,172
Who are you calling?

297
00:23:24,316 --> 00:23:26,910
I'm gonna report their asses.
Sons of bitches.

298
00:23:27,052 --> 00:23:31,011
You actually believe they're gonna take
anything you have to say seriously?

299
00:23:31,156 --> 00:23:35,490
Do you have any idea how that felt?
To have that pig's hands all over me?

300
00:23:35,594 --> 00:23:37,425
And you just stood there!

301
00:23:39,431 --> 00:23:41,228
And then you apologized to him?

302
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:44,234
What did you want me to do?
Get us both shot?

303
00:23:44,336 --> 00:23:47,772
They were gonna shoot us
on Ventura Boulevard! Pathetic.

304
00:23:47,873 --> 00:23:51,639
Well, maybe you would've been satisfied
with just being arrested.

305
00:23:51,744 --> 00:23:55,612
Oh, I get it. Much better to let him
shove his hand up my crotch

306
00:23:55,748 --> 00:23:58,512
than get your name in the paper.

307
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,743
You finally got me
figured out, 'cause see,

308
00:24:00,886 --> 00:24:03,650
that's exactly
what I was worried about right there.

309
00:24:03,756 --> 00:24:06,816
Oh? You weren't afraid that
all your good friends at the studio

310
00:24:06,925 --> 00:24:10,793
were gonna read about you in the morning
and realize he's actually black?

311
00:24:12,431 --> 00:24:14,456
You need to calm down right now.

312
00:24:14,566 --> 00:24:19,401
What I need is a husband who will not just
stand there while I am being molested!

313
00:24:19,505 --> 00:24:22,474
They were cops for God sakes!
They had guns!

314
00:24:24,143 --> 00:24:26,873
Maybe I should've let them
arrest your ass.

315
00:24:26,979 --> 00:24:30,710
Sooner or later you gotta find out
what it is really like to be black.

316
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,615
Fuck you, man.
Like you know.

317
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:37,416
The closest you ever came to being black,
Cameron, was watching The Cosby Show.

318
00:24:37,523 --> 00:24:40,617
At least I wasn't watching it
with the rest of the equestrian team.

319
00:24:40,726 --> 00:24:42,887
You're right, Cameron.
I got a lot to learn

320
00:24:42,995 --> 00:24:46,089
'cause I haven't quite learned
how to shuck and jive.

321
00:24:46,198 --> 00:24:49,065
Let me hear it again.
Thank you, mister policeman.

322
00:24:49,168 --> 00:24:51,898
You sure is mighty kind
to us poor black folk.

323
00:24:52,004 --> 00:24:56,532
You be sure to let me know next time
you wanna finger-fuck my wife.

324
00:24:58,076 --> 00:25:00,977
How the fuck do you say
something like that to me?

325
00:25:02,114 --> 00:25:03,308
You know, fuck you!

326
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:09,045
That's good. A little anger.
It's a bit late, but it's nice to see!

327
00:25:58,904 --> 00:25:59,962
How's it goin'?

328
00:26:00,072 --> 00:26:01,733
Okay.

329
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,967
You didn't get scared
or something, did you?

330
00:26:04,076 --> 00:26:06,840
There's no monsters in the closet, right?
'Cause I hate monsters.

331
00:26:06,945 --> 00:26:09,937
There's no such thing
as monsters.

332
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,039
Ah, that's a good thing.

333
00:26:12,184 --> 00:26:13,651
I heard a bang.

334
00:26:13,752 --> 00:26:15,344
Like a truck bang?

335
00:26:15,487 --> 00:26:17,546
Like a gun.

336
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:28,664
That's funny, 'cause we moved
outta that bad neighborhood.

337
00:26:28,767 --> 00:26:31,565
And there's not
too many guns around here.

338
00:26:32,971 --> 00:26:35,337
How far can bullets go?

339
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,408
They go pretty far.

340
00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:40,307
But they usually get stuck
in something and stop.

341
00:26:40,412 --> 00:26:42,073
What if they don't?

342
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:45,946
You thinking about that bullet
that came through your window?

343
00:26:48,654 --> 00:26:50,713
You think we should move again?

344
00:26:50,856 --> 00:26:52,255
I like it here.

345
00:26:52,357 --> 00:26:54,348
Me too. But if that bullet
found out where we lived...

346
00:26:55,994 --> 00:26:56,983
Oh, hold on.

347
00:26:57,095 --> 00:26:58,585
What?

348
00:26:58,697 --> 00:27:00,722
So stupid!
How can I forget this?

349
00:27:02,134 --> 00:27:03,101
What?

350
00:27:05,304 --> 00:27:06,965
Nah. Forget it.
You ain't gonna believe me.

351
00:27:07,072 --> 00:27:08,630
Tell me.

352
00:27:09,508 --> 00:27:11,942
Okay.

353
00:27:12,044 --> 00:27:15,707
When I was five, this fairy
came into my room one night.

354
00:27:15,814 --> 00:27:18,442
- Right.
- See, I told you you weren't gonna believe me.

355
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:21,017
- Okay, go to sleep now, you little rat.
- No, tell me.

356
00:27:23,155 --> 00:27:25,419
Okay.

357
00:27:25,524 --> 00:27:30,791
So this fairy comes into my room and I'm like,
"Yeah, right, you're a fairy."

358
00:27:30,896 --> 00:27:32,921
Anyway, we're talking, you know.

359
00:27:33,031 --> 00:27:36,125
And she's flying all around the room,
knocking down all my posters and stuff.

360
00:27:36,234 --> 00:27:38,600
She was flying?

361
00:27:38,704 --> 00:27:41,332
She had these little stubby wings.
She could've glued 'em on, you know?

362
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,068
Like I'm gonna believe
she's a fairy.

363
00:27:44,176 --> 00:27:46,144
So she said, "I'll prove it."

364
00:27:46,244 --> 00:27:48,838
So she reaches
into her backpack.

365
00:27:48,947 --> 00:27:51,211
And she pulls out
this invisible cloak.

366
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:55,912
She ties it around my neck, and she tells me
that it's impenetrable.

367
00:27:56,054 --> 00:27:58,284
You know what
impenetrable means?

368
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,255
It means that nothing
can go through it.

369
00:28:00,292 --> 00:28:02,556
No bullets. Nothing.

370
00:28:02,661 --> 00:28:06,529
She told me that if I wore it,
nothing would hurt me.

371
00:28:06,631 --> 00:28:11,591
So I did. And my whole life,
I never got shot, stabbed.

372
00:28:11,703 --> 00:28:14,638
Nothing.
I mean, how weird is that?

373
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:18,699
Only she told me that I was supposed to give it
to my daughter on her fifth birthday.

374
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:20,573
And I forgot.

375
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:22,169
Can I touch it?

376
00:28:22,314 --> 00:28:24,339
Sure, go ahead.

377
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:29,744
- I don't feel it.
- Yeah. It's pretty cool, huh?

378
00:28:29,888 --> 00:28:33,756
I can take it off and tie it around your
shoulders. She told me how to do it.

379
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:37,488
- Unless you think it's stupid.
- Don't you need it?

380
00:28:37,596 --> 00:28:40,394
No, not anymore.

381
00:28:40,499 --> 00:28:43,434
So what do you think?
You want it?

382
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:51,437
Okay, let's get outta here.

383
00:28:57,182 --> 00:28:58,149
Okay.

384
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:14,792
Put your head up.

385
00:29:19,771 --> 00:29:22,467
Okay. Is that too tight?

386
00:29:22,574 --> 00:29:25,042
Do you feel anything at all?

387
00:29:25,143 --> 00:29:27,543
Good. Then it's just right.

388
00:29:33,852 --> 00:29:36,320
Do I take it off
when I have a bath?

389
00:29:36,455 --> 00:29:39,219
No, you leave it on
all the time.

390
00:29:39,324 --> 00:29:44,694
Until you have a daughter when she turns five,
then you give it to her.

391
00:29:44,796 --> 00:29:46,093
Okay?

392
00:29:46,965 --> 00:29:47,932
Okay.

393
00:29:50,368 --> 00:29:53,804
Okay. Good night, sweetie.

394
00:29:55,006 --> 00:29:57,531
Good night.

395
00:30:36,882 --> 00:30:40,283
Nah, nah. You wanna listen to music
of the oppressor, you go right ahead, man.

396
00:30:41,219 --> 00:30:44,450
How in the lunacy of your mind
is hip-hop music of the oppressor?

397
00:30:44,556 --> 00:30:47,821
Listen to it, man!
"Nigger this, nigger that."

398
00:30:47,926 --> 00:30:51,384
You think white people go around calling
each other honkies all day, man?

399
00:30:51,496 --> 00:30:52,929
"Hey, honky, how's business?"

400
00:30:53,031 --> 00:30:54,999
"Going great, cracker.
We're diversifying."

401
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:59,901
How 'bout this, huh? Listen. You like that?
Man's singin' about lynchin' niggers.

402
00:31:00,005 --> 00:31:01,734
And you think
there's a difference, don't you? Huh?

403
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,936
Gonna buy me a rope
and lynch me a nigger

404
00:31:06,044 --> 00:31:09,241
You have absolutely no idea where hip-hop
music comes from, do you?

405
00:31:09,347 --> 00:31:11,907
I'd shoot 'em dead first
but I done broke my trigger

406
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,280
See, back in the '60s we had
smart, articulate black men.

407
00:31:14,419 --> 00:31:16,717
Gonna get out my sheet
Put my hood on my head

408
00:31:16,821 --> 00:31:19,722
Like Huey Newton, Bobby Seale,
Eldridge Cleaver, Fred Hampton.

409
00:31:19,824 --> 00:31:21,189
Gonna string 'em up good

410
00:31:21,293 --> 00:31:23,090
These brothers were speaking out,
and people were listening!

411
00:31:23,195 --> 00:31:24,890
Then they'll be dead

412
00:31:24,996 --> 00:31:26,987
Then the FBI said,
"No, we can't have that."

413
00:31:27,098 --> 00:31:29,896
Home of the brave
and the land of the free

414
00:31:30,001 --> 00:31:32,060
"Let's give the niggers
this music by a bunch of mumbling idiots

415
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:34,900
and sooner or later,
they'll all copy it, and nobody

416
00:31:35,006 --> 00:31:36,997
will be able to understand
a fucking word they say.

417
00:31:37,108 --> 00:31:39,269
End of problem."

418
00:31:46,251 --> 00:31:47,582
What the fuck was that, dawg?

419
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,130
- Holy shit!
- What?

420
00:32:04,236 --> 00:32:05,794
Man, we done ran over a Chinaman.

421
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:08,767
You're sayin' there's a Chinaman
under this truck?

422
00:32:08,873 --> 00:32:09,965
What part don't you understand?

423
00:32:10,075 --> 00:32:12,908
There's a Chinaman stuck
underneath the fucking truck.

424
00:32:15,347 --> 00:32:16,314
Help me.

425
00:32:16,448 --> 00:32:19,110
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

426
00:32:19,251 --> 00:32:22,914
Ah, God. What the hell did he do,
just leap out in front of the truck?

427
00:32:23,822 --> 00:32:26,086
Man! This is so
completely fucked up.

428
00:32:26,191 --> 00:32:28,056
Oh, really? No shit!

429
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,219
Okay, hold up.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

430
00:32:31,329 --> 00:32:33,297
- Get back in the truck.
- What?

431
00:32:33,398 --> 00:32:35,593
- Yes, get back in the truck.
- You think we didn't drag him far enough?

432
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,567
No, we gonna drive away.
And he gonna let go.

433
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:40,365
He's not gonna let go, Anthony.

434
00:32:40,472 --> 00:32:43,566
You know why? Because he's stuck
underneath the fucking truck!

435
00:32:43,675 --> 00:32:48,908
Now, if he could've let go, he probably would've
considered that option half a block back.

436
00:32:49,014 --> 00:32:52,472
What you and I gotta do, just grab his arms
and pull him from underneath.

437
00:32:52,617 --> 00:32:54,209
You grab his arm,
it's gonna fall off.

438
00:32:54,352 --> 00:32:57,116
Then you gonna be standing in the street
holding a Chinaman's arm.

439
00:32:57,222 --> 00:32:59,122
Then what your ass gonna do, huh?

440
00:33:00,058 --> 00:33:03,585
If we leave this man here, he dies.
Then we're up for murder charges.

441
00:33:04,596 --> 00:33:07,656
Just grab his arm.
We'll just pull him out.

442
00:33:12,837 --> 00:33:16,136
I don't wanna cause any problems, Lieutenant.
I just want a new partner.

443
00:33:16,241 --> 00:33:18,300
I understand. Your partner's a racist prick.

444
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:20,844
But you don't wanna stir up
any bad feelings with him.

445
00:33:20,945 --> 00:33:22,742
He's been on the force for a long time.

446
00:33:22,847 --> 00:33:25,008
Seventeen years.

447
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:27,345
And I do have to work here, sir.

448
00:33:27,485 --> 00:33:29,885
So you don't mind
that there's a racist prick on the force.

449
00:33:29,988 --> 00:33:32,957
You just don't want him
to ride in your car.

450
00:33:33,058 --> 00:33:35,856
If you need me to go on record
about this, sir, I will.

451
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,757
That'd be great.
Write a full report.

452
00:33:37,862 --> 00:33:40,660
Because I'm anxious to
understand how an obvious bigot

453
00:33:40,765 --> 00:33:43,700
could've gone undetected
in this department for 17 years.

454
00:33:43,802 --> 00:33:45,963
Eleven of which he was under
my personal supervision.

455
00:33:46,071 --> 00:33:48,471
Which doesn't speak very highly
of my managerial skills.

456
00:33:48,573 --> 00:33:52,270
But that's not your concern.
I can't wait to read it.

457
00:33:52,377 --> 00:33:56,279
What if I said I wanted a new partner
for personal reasons?

458
00:33:56,381 --> 00:33:59,646
So now you're saying he's not a racist prick,
you just don't like him.

459
00:33:59,784 --> 00:34:02,651
- Yes, sir.
- That's not a good enough reason.

460
00:34:02,754 --> 00:34:05,655
Then I guess I should think of a better one
and get back to you.

461
00:34:05,757 --> 00:34:08,692
So you think I'm asking you
to make one up.

462
00:34:08,793 --> 00:34:13,560
Uh, no, sir. I just can't
think of one... right now.

463
00:34:13,665 --> 00:34:15,758
You wanna know what I heard?

464
00:34:17,202 --> 00:34:19,261
I heard it was a case
of uncontrollable flatulence.

465
00:34:19,371 --> 00:34:21,498
You want me to say
he has flatulence?

466
00:34:21,606 --> 00:34:24,370
Not him. You.
You have uncontrollable flatulence.

467
00:34:24,476 --> 00:34:27,934
You're too embarrassed to ride with anybody
else so you're requesting a one-man car.

468
00:34:28,046 --> 00:34:30,981
I'm not... comfortable with that,
Lieutenant.

469
00:34:31,116 --> 00:34:34,017
I wouldn't be either. Which is why
I understand your need for privacy.

470
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:37,885
Just like I'm sure you understand how hard
a black man has to work to get to,

471
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:41,117
say, where I am, in a racist fucking
organization like the L.A.P.D.

472
00:34:41,226 --> 00:34:44,252
and how easily
that can be taken away.

473
00:34:44,362 --> 00:34:47,456
Now, that being said,
it's your decision.

474
00:34:47,565 --> 00:34:52,366
You can put your career and mine on the line
in pursuit of a just cause,

475
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:56,372
or you can admit to having
an embarrassing problem

476
00:34:56,474 --> 00:34:58,772
of a personal nature.

477
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,048
Fuck.

478
00:35:34,446 --> 00:35:35,413
Excuse me.

479
00:35:36,815 --> 00:35:39,375
Excuse me. Sir?

480
00:35:39,517 --> 00:35:40,745
You finished?

481
00:35:40,885 --> 00:35:44,651
I replaced the lock.
But you got a real problem with that door.

482
00:35:44,756 --> 00:35:47,224
You fix the lock?

483
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:51,488
Nah, I replaced the lock.
But you gotta fix that door.

484
00:35:51,596 --> 00:35:54,997
- Just fix the lock!
- Sir, sir, sir. Listen to me.

485
00:35:55,099 --> 00:35:58,262
What you need
is a new door.

486
00:35:58,369 --> 00:36:00,803
- I need new door?
- Yeah.

487
00:36:00,905 --> 00:36:03,373
Okay. How much?

488
00:36:03,475 --> 00:36:07,411
I don't... Sir, you're gonna have to call
somebody that sells doors.

489
00:36:07,512 --> 00:36:11,608
You try to cheat me, right?
You have a friend that fix door?

490
00:36:11,749 --> 00:36:13,876
Nah, I don't have a friend
that fix doors, bro.

491
00:36:14,018 --> 00:36:16,350
Then go and fix the fucking lock, you cheater.

492
00:36:16,454 --> 00:36:19,218
You... You know what?

493
00:36:19,324 --> 00:36:22,782
Why don't you just pay for the lock
and I won't charge you for the time.

494
00:36:22,894 --> 00:36:25,294
You don't fix the lock!
I pay! You think I'm stupid?

495
00:36:25,396 --> 00:36:28,559
You fix the fucking lock,
you cheater!

496
00:36:28,666 --> 00:36:31,157
- I'd appreciate if you'd stop calling me names.
- Then fix the fucking lock!

497
00:36:31,269 --> 00:36:34,705
I replaced the lock!
You gotta fix the fucking door!

498
00:36:34,806 --> 00:36:38,037
You cheat!
You fucking cheater!

499
00:36:38,142 --> 00:36:40,838
- Fine. Don't pay.
- What?

500
00:36:40,945 --> 00:36:43,675
- Have a good night.
- What? No. Wait!

501
00:36:43,815 --> 00:36:46,784
Wait! You come back here!
You fix the lock!

502
00:36:46,918 --> 00:36:49,045
Come here! You fix my lock!

503
00:36:49,187 --> 00:36:50,677
Fix the fucking lock!

504
00:36:56,895 --> 00:37:00,854
I understand. You run over a Chinaman.
Stuff him in the back.

505
00:37:00,965 --> 00:37:03,832
Then bring the truck here
so I can share in the experience.

506
00:37:03,935 --> 00:37:06,768
Come on, man. It's a little bit of blood.
It'll wash right off.

507
00:37:06,871 --> 00:37:09,169
- Georgie, burn this thing.
- Burn it?

508
00:37:09,274 --> 00:37:11,504
It's a brand-new Navigator.
All you need is a little piece of carpet.

509
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:13,600
You watch the Discovery Channel?

510
00:37:13,711 --> 00:37:17,112
- Not a lot.
- They got some good shit on that channel.

511
00:37:17,248 --> 00:37:20,809
Every night there is a show
with somebody shining a blue light

512
00:37:20,952 --> 00:37:25,150
and finding tiny specks of blood splattered
on carpets and walls and ceiling fans,

513
00:37:25,256 --> 00:37:29,784
bathroom fixtures and special-edition plastic
Burger King tray cups.

514
00:37:29,894 --> 00:37:33,386
The next thing they show is some stupid
redneck in handcuffs

515
00:37:33,498 --> 00:37:37,696
who looks absolutely stunned
that this is happening to him.

516
00:37:37,802 --> 00:37:40,828
Sometimes the redneck is actually watching
the Discovery Channel

517
00:37:40,939 --> 00:37:42,930
when they break in to arrest him.

518
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:48,274
And he still can't figure out how on earth
they could've caught him!

519
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:00,122
Do I look like I wanna be
on the Discovery Channel?

520
00:38:00,224 --> 00:38:01,418
No.

521
00:38:01,526 --> 00:38:04,086
Then get the fuck
outta my shop.

522
00:38:06,598 --> 00:38:08,725
Oh, yeah, make sure
you get that.

523
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:12,234
Without him, things could've gone really
fucking wrong tonight.

524
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:18,105
- Fuck!
- Don't! Don't you dare.

525
00:38:18,209 --> 00:38:20,074
Don't.

526
00:38:20,178 --> 00:38:23,272
Graham Waters.

527
00:38:23,414 --> 00:38:27,646
No. No, he's not here, Mom.

528
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,089
I'm not gonna go looking for him.

529
00:38:32,223 --> 00:38:35,522
Look, he'll be home when...
Just leave it alone.

530
00:38:35,627 --> 00:38:40,291
Mom, I can't talk to you right now, okay?
I'm having sex with a white woman.

531
00:38:40,398 --> 00:38:42,832
Okay, where were we?

532
00:38:42,934 --> 00:38:45,402
I was white, and you were
about to jerk off in the shower.

533
00:38:45,503 --> 00:38:48,370
Oh, shit!

534
00:38:48,473 --> 00:38:50,532
Come on.

535
00:38:50,642 --> 00:38:55,602
I would've said you were Mexican, but I don't
think it would've pissed her off as much.

536
00:38:55,713 --> 00:38:58,011
Why do you keep everybody
at a certain distance, huh?

537
00:38:58,149 --> 00:39:01,778
- What, you start to feel something and panic?
- Come on, Maria.

538
00:39:01,919 --> 00:39:05,355
You're just pissed
'cause I answered the phone.

539
00:39:05,456 --> 00:39:07,822
That's just where
I begin to get pissed.

540
00:39:07,925 --> 00:39:11,258
I mean, really, what kind of man
speaks to his mother that way?

541
00:39:11,362 --> 00:39:15,423
Oh, this is about my mother.
What do you know about my mother?

542
00:39:15,533 --> 00:39:18,468
If I was your father,
I'd kick your fucking ass.

543
00:39:19,937 --> 00:39:21,928
Okay. I was raised badly.

544
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,476
Why don't you take your clothes off,
get back into bed and teach me a lesson?

545
00:39:25,576 --> 00:39:29,535
You want a lesson? I'll give you a lesson.
How 'bout a geography lesson?

546
00:39:29,647 --> 00:39:33,777
My father's from Puerto Rico.
My mother's from El Salvador.

547
00:39:33,918 --> 00:39:36,944
Neither one of those is Mexico.

548
00:39:37,088 --> 00:39:39,522
Ah. Then I guess the big mystery is

549
00:39:39,624 --> 00:39:43,082
who gathered all those
remarkably different cultures together

550
00:39:43,194 --> 00:39:46,254
and taught them all how
to park their cars on their lawns?

551
00:40:14,058 --> 00:40:16,424
Pop, you okay?

552
00:40:16,527 --> 00:40:19,553
If I could piss, I'd be okay.

553
00:40:21,099 --> 00:40:23,829
I'm... Jesus.

554
00:40:23,935 --> 00:40:26,426
I'm done now.

555
00:40:26,537 --> 00:40:28,562
Give me a hand.

556
00:40:31,075 --> 00:40:33,009
Wait a goddamn minute!

557
00:40:33,111 --> 00:40:35,773
- Wait a minute.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

558
00:40:37,782 --> 00:40:41,218
All right. Okay. Okay.

559
00:40:48,626 --> 00:40:51,220
Wait, wait, wait.
Stop, stop!

560
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:53,991
- I gotta go back.
- Okay.

561
00:41:06,277 --> 00:41:09,371
What, are you gonna
stand there and stare at me?

562
00:42:18,349 --> 00:42:20,977
- So Conklin just shot him?
- Mm-hmm.

563
00:42:21,118 --> 00:42:22,779
- They know each other?
- Sir.

564
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,012
It's a grudge thing?

565
00:42:24,155 --> 00:42:26,055
Not as far as we can tell.

566
00:42:27,391 --> 00:42:29,188
You think this is
racially motivated?

567
00:42:29,293 --> 00:42:32,626
Well, a dozen people heard the shots.
Nobody saw anything.

568
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:34,698
- Who do we have on it?
- Graham Waters.

569
00:42:34,799 --> 00:42:38,792
Waters. All right. Well, tell him
he speaks to no one but me.

570
00:42:38,903 --> 00:42:42,066
Call a press conference for 4:00,
and I want Waters here at 3:30.

571
00:42:42,173 --> 00:42:44,073
And would someone
please find Flanagan.

572
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,737
Oh! What up, Mo Phat?

573
00:42:49,447 --> 00:42:53,747
Man robs purses from old ladies and you,
"Hey, how's it goin', Mo Phat?"

574
00:42:53,885 --> 00:42:56,877
That nigger will steal teeth
from a cripple, man.

575
00:42:57,021 --> 00:42:59,512
You callin' him a thief?
And we do what?

576
00:42:59,657 --> 00:43:01,557
The man steals
from black people.

577
00:43:01,659 --> 00:43:05,891
Only reason black people steal from their own
is 'cause they terrified of white people.

578
00:43:05,997 --> 00:43:07,259
Oh, man, please.

579
00:43:07,365 --> 00:43:10,732
Think about it. Sherman Oaks.
Burbank. Santa Monica.

580
00:43:10,835 --> 00:43:13,395
All scary-ass places
for a brother to find himself.

581
00:43:13,504 --> 00:43:15,904
Drop Mo Phat at a Starbucks
in Toluca Lake,

582
00:43:16,007 --> 00:43:20,137
that nigger will run like a rabbit soon
as somebody say "decaf latte."

583
00:43:20,244 --> 00:43:23,475
What the fuck did you do to my car?

584
00:43:30,888 --> 00:43:34,324
Sorry I take your car, Miss Jean.

585
00:43:34,425 --> 00:43:37,394
I turn key to my car, but nothing.

586
00:43:37,495 --> 00:43:39,429
James wanted to take this to school.

587
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:42,226
But I don't want the kids to fight over it.

588
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:46,064
- Are these clean or dirty?
- All clean, senora!

589
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:51,073
You know, Maria, just once I would like to
wake up and find these dishes in the cabinet.

590
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:54,970
Si, senora.
No problem.

591
00:43:56,547 --> 00:43:58,310
I'm startin' to understand now.

592
00:43:58,449 --> 00:44:01,350
By your work, you're settin' an example
for our neighborhood.

593
00:44:01,452 --> 00:44:03,920
Sort of like a big brother
kind of thing, right?

594
00:44:04,956 --> 00:44:06,423
Yeah, you laugh, man.

595
00:44:06,557 --> 00:44:10,687
But you have never seen me steal
from a black person ever in your life.

596
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:14,857
What the hell do you think
you doin' right now, man?

597
00:44:14,966 --> 00:44:16,433
Wavin' down the bus.

598
00:44:16,534 --> 00:44:19,025
Put your hand down, dawg!
Are you outta your mind?

599
00:44:19,136 --> 00:44:21,536
You actually expect me
to get on a bus?

600
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:23,903
No. I was hopin' we could
push your car across town.

601
00:44:24,008 --> 00:44:25,942
You know why? 'Cause we just don't
do stuff like that no more.

602
00:44:26,043 --> 00:44:28,671
You have no idea, do you?

603
00:44:28,779 --> 00:44:32,271
You have no idea why they put them great big
windows on the sides of buses, do you?

604
00:44:32,416 --> 00:44:34,907
- Why?
- One reason only.

605
00:44:35,052 --> 00:44:39,386
To humiliate the people of color
who are reduced to ridin' on 'em.

606
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:40,855
I didn't know that.

607
00:44:40,958 --> 00:44:43,927
You could fill the Staples Center
with what you don't know.

608
00:44:44,028 --> 00:44:45,996
You know the Kings
are playin' tonight.

609
00:44:46,097 --> 00:44:49,464
You don't like hockey! The only reason
you say you do is to piss me off!

610
00:44:49,567 --> 00:44:51,865
I love hockey.

611
00:44:51,969 --> 00:44:53,527
Cut! Print. Moving on.

612
00:44:53,637 --> 00:44:54,763
Okay, that takes us into scene 12.

613
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:56,204
Okay, that takes us into scene 12.

614
00:44:57,942 --> 00:45:00,968
Jamal, that's what
I'm talking about.

615
00:45:01,078 --> 00:45:02,443
Right on.

616
00:45:04,348 --> 00:45:07,784
- Cam, you got a second?
- Yeah, Fred, I just wanna grab some coffee.

617
00:45:07,885 --> 00:45:10,649
Yeah. Listen. I think
we need another take, buddy.

618
00:45:10,755 --> 00:45:13,485
That looked
pretty terrific, man.

619
00:45:13,591 --> 00:45:17,755
This is gonna sound strange, but is Jamal
seeing a speech coach or something?

620
00:45:17,862 --> 00:45:19,796
What do you mean?

621
00:45:19,897 --> 00:45:23,355
Have you noticed, uh...
This is weird for a white guy to say,

622
00:45:23,467 --> 00:45:27,233
but have you noticed
he's talking a lot less black lately?

623
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:30,807
No, I haven't noticed that.

624
00:45:30,908 --> 00:45:34,901
Really? Like in this scene, he was supposed to
say, "Don't be talkin' 'bout that."

625
00:45:35,012 --> 00:45:37,344
And he changed it to,
"Don't talk to me about that."

626
00:45:37,481 --> 00:45:38,743
Wait a minute.

627
00:45:38,883 --> 00:45:43,411
You think because of that, the audience
won't recognize him as being a black man?

628
00:45:43,554 --> 00:45:44,521
Come on!

629
00:45:44,655 --> 00:45:46,714
Is there a problem, Cam?

630
00:45:46,857 --> 00:45:48,449
Excuse me?

631
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:50,857
Is there a problem, Cam?

632
00:45:55,766 --> 00:45:58,291
No, we don't have a problem.

633
00:45:58,402 --> 00:46:01,599
I mean, 'cause all I'm saying
is it's not his character.

634
00:46:01,705 --> 00:46:04,299
Eddie's supposed to be
the smart one, not Jamal, right?

635
00:46:04,408 --> 00:46:08,208
You're the expert here.
But to me, it rings false.

636
00:46:11,582 --> 00:46:15,382
- We're gonna do it one more time.
- Thanks, buddy.

637
00:46:15,486 --> 00:46:19,422
Everybody back.
Let's do it one more time.

638
00:46:21,959 --> 00:46:24,052
Jamal, um...

639
00:46:28,265 --> 00:46:29,892
Morning, Carol.
Who do I have?

640
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,331
Hold for a minute, please.

641
00:46:31,435 --> 00:46:35,633
Mr. Trujillo called and cancelled,
but you have a walk-in, Mr. Ryan.

642
00:46:38,876 --> 00:46:41,606
Send him in.

643
00:46:41,712 --> 00:46:44,010
- Mr. Ryan.
- Yeah.

644
00:46:44,115 --> 00:46:46,276
My name is Shaniqua Johnson.

645
00:46:46,417 --> 00:46:48,977
I believe we spoke last night.

646
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:52,556
Oh, yeah. I wanted
to apologize about that.

647
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:55,682
I haven't been gettin' too much sleep.
My father's in a lot of pain.

648
00:46:55,793 --> 00:46:58,284
Oh! I'm sorry to hear that.

649
00:46:58,395 --> 00:47:02,491
This doctor he's been seein'
says he's got a urinary tract infection.

650
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:06,092
But he's been takin' this medicine for a month,
and he keeps gettin' worse.

651
00:47:06,203 --> 00:47:08,228
And he's been back to see
Dr. Robertson?

652
00:47:08,339 --> 00:47:11,035
Yeah. Between you and me,
the man's an idiot.

653
00:47:11,142 --> 00:47:13,076
- Really?
- No offense.

654
00:47:13,177 --> 00:47:16,613
But the guy sees 100 patients an hour.
I think his nurses are doing most of the work.

655
00:47:16,714 --> 00:47:21,777
Mmm. If you're unhappy, your father's welcome
to see a doctor outside the network.

656
00:47:21,919 --> 00:47:26,356
And if this new doctor
says it's not an infection,

657
00:47:26,457 --> 00:47:29,585
says it's his prostate and it needs to be
operated on, is that gonna be covered?

658
00:47:29,693 --> 00:47:33,288
- Not unless Dr. Robertson authorizes...
- What good is that gonna do?

659
00:47:33,397 --> 00:47:36,093
I'm sorry. There's nothing else I can do.

660
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,566
All right.
You know what I can't do?

661
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:42,464
I can't look at you without
thinking about the five or six

662
00:47:42,573 --> 00:47:44,939
more qualified white men
who didn't get your job.

663
00:47:45,042 --> 00:47:46,771
It's time for you to go.

664
00:47:46,877 --> 00:47:50,005
I'm saying this 'cause I'm hoping
that I'm wrong about you.

665
00:47:50,114 --> 00:47:51,741
I'm hoping that someone like yourself,

666
00:47:51,882 --> 00:47:54,112
someone who may have been
given a helping hand,

667
00:47:54,251 --> 00:47:57,015
might have a little compassion
for someone in a similar situation.

668
00:47:57,121 --> 00:47:59,180
Carol, I need security in my office!

669
00:47:59,323 --> 00:48:02,349
You don't like me, that's fine.
I'm a prick.

670
00:48:02,459 --> 00:48:05,019
My father doesn't deserve
to suffer like this.

671
00:48:05,129 --> 00:48:07,154
He was a janitor.
He struggled his whole life.

672
00:48:07,264 --> 00:48:09,095
Saved enough to start
his own company.

673
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,168
Twenty-three employees,
all of them black.

674
00:48:11,268 --> 00:48:13,964
Paid 'em equal wages
when no one else was doing that.

675
00:48:14,071 --> 00:48:18,940
For 30 years he worked side by side with
those men, sweeping and carrying garbage.

676
00:48:19,043 --> 00:48:20,908
Then the city council decides to give

677
00:48:21,011 --> 00:48:24,276
minority-owned companies
preference in city contracts.

678
00:48:24,415 --> 00:48:27,145
And overnight,
my father loses everything.

679
00:48:27,284 --> 00:48:30,685
His business, his home, his wife.
Everything!

680
00:48:30,788 --> 00:48:34,451
Not once does he blame your people.

681
00:48:34,558 --> 00:48:38,050
I'm not asking you to help me.

682
00:48:38,162 --> 00:48:42,496
I'm asking that you do this small thing
for a man who lost everything

683
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,932
so people like yourself
could reap the benefits.

684
00:48:45,035 --> 00:48:47,333
And do you know
what it's gonna cost you?

685
00:48:47,438 --> 00:48:49,372
Nothing.

686
00:48:49,473 --> 00:48:51,407
Just a flick of your pen.

687
00:48:52,977 --> 00:48:55,912
Your father sounds
like a good man.

688
00:48:56,013 --> 00:49:00,143
And if he'd come in here today, I probably
would've approved this request.

689
00:49:00,284 --> 00:49:04,721
But he didn't come in. You did.
And for his sake, it's a real shame.

690
00:49:04,788 --> 00:49:07,757
Get him the hell outta my office.

691
00:49:11,862 --> 00:49:14,763
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

692
00:49:14,865 --> 00:49:19,495
Sir, I spoke to our employee, and he told you
you needed to replace or repair the door.

693
00:49:19,603 --> 00:49:21,264
He say he fix the lock.

694
00:49:21,372 --> 00:49:23,966
- You come here, see how "fix-ed" it is!
- You're yelling again.

695
00:49:24,074 --> 00:49:25,974
I am not yelling! I'm upset!

696
00:49:26,076 --> 00:49:28,442
Yes... Yes, I am.

697
00:49:28,545 --> 00:49:30,172
Mom, are you all right?

698
00:49:30,314 --> 00:49:34,546
Stop washing.
Insurance must take picture.

699
00:49:34,685 --> 00:49:36,152
Okay?

700
00:49:37,554 --> 00:49:39,920
Look what they wrote.

701
00:49:40,024 --> 00:49:41,992
They think we're Arab.

702
00:49:42,126 --> 00:49:44,185
When did Persian become Arab?

703
00:49:44,295 --> 00:49:47,128
I want his name. Yes.

704
00:49:47,231 --> 00:49:48,823
Oh, my God.

705
00:49:48,932 --> 00:49:51,992
- I want his name! Give me his name!
- Dad?

706
00:49:52,102 --> 00:49:53,467
I'm not giving you his name, sir.

707
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:57,370
- Dad, did they take the gun?
- Not fix my lock! I want his name!

708
00:49:57,474 --> 00:49:59,499
I'm gonna hang up now, sir.

709
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:03,376
Don't hang up! Shit!

710
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,311
Oh, thank God.

711
00:50:51,261 --> 00:50:52,523
Mom?

712
00:50:54,298 --> 00:50:56,528
Mom, it's cold. Come on.

713
00:51:18,789 --> 00:51:21,087
Did you find your brother?

714
00:51:23,227 --> 00:51:25,354
No, Mom.

715
00:51:34,838 --> 00:51:37,363
I was doin' good.

716
00:51:38,675 --> 00:51:42,133
I was... I was doin' real good.

717
00:51:43,947 --> 00:51:46,245
- I know, Mom.
- I was doin'...

718
00:51:51,188 --> 00:51:53,122
It's okay.

719
00:52:04,501 --> 00:52:06,662
Did you find your brother?

720
00:52:09,006 --> 00:52:11,406
No, Mom.

721
00:52:12,743 --> 00:52:15,268
Tell him to come home.

722
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:21,947
Tell him I'm not mad, okay?
Okay, baby?

723
00:52:22,085 --> 00:52:24,645
Okay, Mom.

724
00:52:24,788 --> 00:52:27,256
Okay, baby.

725
00:52:27,391 --> 00:52:28,983
Okay.

726
00:52:30,027 --> 00:52:32,052
Okay.

727
00:53:07,664 --> 00:53:10,599
- Did you apologize to your mother?
- She wasn't there.

728
00:53:12,569 --> 00:53:16,198
Internal Affairs called.
Found something in the Mercedes.

729
00:53:18,976 --> 00:53:21,206
That's lunch. One hour.

730
00:53:50,407 --> 00:53:52,238
I tried to call.

731
00:53:52,342 --> 00:53:54,469
Sounded like you're havin'
a bad day, huh?

732
00:53:54,578 --> 00:53:55,875
Yeah.

733
00:54:00,384 --> 00:54:02,181
What?

734
00:54:03,186 --> 00:54:05,154
I got scared, Cam.

735
00:54:05,255 --> 00:54:10,716
It's not like I haven't been
pulled over before. You know?

736
00:54:10,827 --> 00:54:12,818
But not like that.

737
00:54:14,164 --> 00:54:16,155
And, yes, I was a little drunk.

738
00:54:16,266 --> 00:54:20,202
And I was mouthing off.

739
00:54:20,304 --> 00:54:22,499
I'm sorry.

740
00:54:24,641 --> 00:54:26,370
But when that man was
putting his hands on me...

741
00:54:26,476 --> 00:54:28,171
I don't wanna talk about it.

742
00:54:28,278 --> 00:54:31,611
I can't believe
you let him do that, baby.

743
00:54:32,983 --> 00:54:36,578
Look, I know what you did
was the right thing. Okay?

744
00:54:38,155 --> 00:54:40,851
But I was humiliated!

745
00:54:40,958 --> 00:54:43,119
For you.

746
00:54:43,226 --> 00:54:47,686
I just couldn't stand to see
that man take away your dignity.

747
00:54:47,798 --> 00:54:50,824
Yeah. That's what happened.

748
00:54:50,934 --> 00:54:53,960
- Oh, baby, don't do this.
- No. No, you're right.

749
00:54:54,071 --> 00:54:55,834
I ain't doin' it.

750
00:54:55,939 --> 00:54:58,464
You gonna walk away from me?

751
00:54:58,575 --> 00:55:01,738
- Cameron!
- Just go home.

752
00:55:07,784 --> 00:55:09,115
Mm-hmm.

753
00:55:10,654 --> 00:55:11,621
I understand.

754
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:14,918
Thanks.

755
00:55:18,295 --> 00:55:21,696
- Has your father read his policy?
- He doesn't read English.

756
00:55:25,535 --> 00:55:27,799
Mr. Golzari, you said
you called the locksmith?

757
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:30,800
Yes. I tell him, fix it.

758
00:55:31,742 --> 00:55:38,045
They said their man told you to fix the door,
and you didn't do so.

759
00:55:40,083 --> 00:55:42,074
Are you saying it's his fault?

760
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:47,823
Insurance company is calling it negligence.
They're not covering any of this.

761
00:55:55,532 --> 00:56:00,629
No. This store is all we have.

762
00:56:17,821 --> 00:56:19,846
I really am sorry.

763
00:56:42,412 --> 00:56:44,573
What time
you must go to work?

764
00:56:44,715 --> 00:56:45,943
Not until tonight.

765
00:56:47,718 --> 00:56:49,185
Go home and sleep.

766
00:56:52,422 --> 00:56:55,016
It's okay. It's okay.
Go home and sleep.

767
00:57:18,281 --> 00:57:19,339
Hey.

768
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:24,552
Maybe they didn't tell you,
but I've been reassigned.

769
00:57:24,654 --> 00:57:26,849
Yeah, they told me.

770
00:57:26,957 --> 00:57:29,755
I just wanted to say, good luck

771
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:31,691
and it was good ridin' with you.

772
00:57:31,795 --> 00:57:33,456
You too.

773
00:57:36,466 --> 00:57:39,731
Wait till you've been
on the job a few more years.

774
00:57:39,836 --> 00:57:43,033
- Yeah.
- Look at me, look at me.

775
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:47,770
Wait till you've been doin' it
a little longer.

776
00:57:47,878 --> 00:57:51,780
You think you know
who you are, hmm?

777
00:57:51,915 --> 00:57:54,679
You have no idea.

778
00:57:58,188 --> 00:58:01,214
Yo, Gomez,
you ready to roll, homie?

779
00:58:01,324 --> 00:58:03,155
Ready, amigo.

780
00:58:12,969 --> 00:58:15,995
Radio check, 2-1-L-2-3.

781
00:58:16,106 --> 00:58:20,770
2-1-L-23, picking up screams and noises
from your car.

782
00:58:20,877 --> 00:58:24,677
21-L, is your mike open
by any chance?

783
01:00:37,147 --> 01:00:37,977
Call it in.

784
01:01:16,519 --> 01:01:17,281
Ma'am?

785
01:01:17,387 --> 01:01:19,287
Can you hear me?

786
01:01:19,389 --> 01:01:21,949
Paramedics are rolling.
They'll be here in two minutes.

787
01:01:22,058 --> 01:01:25,118
- Get an extinguisher, and get that fire out.
- Jesus.

788
01:01:28,798 --> 01:01:32,199
Ma'am, are you hurt?

789
01:01:32,302 --> 01:01:35,362
- Can you move?
- l... I can't breathe.

790
01:01:38,441 --> 01:01:41,467
Okay, I'm gonna get you out.

791
01:01:48,284 --> 01:01:49,751
It's okay.

792
01:01:53,957 --> 01:01:56,448
Okay. Okay.

793
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:58,459
Okay, I'm gonna get you out.

794
01:02:02,732 --> 01:02:04,825
No!

795
01:02:04,934 --> 01:02:07,869
- It's okay.
- Get away from me!

796
01:02:08,038 --> 01:02:11,064
Get away.
Stay away from me!

797
01:02:11,174 --> 01:02:14,473
Not you! Not you!

798
01:02:14,577 --> 01:02:17,375
- It's okay.
- Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

799
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:21,075
- Keep away from me!
- Lady, I'm tryin'... I'm tryin' to help you.

800
01:02:21,217 --> 01:02:23,708
Fuck you! Not you!

801
01:02:23,853 --> 01:02:26,822
Somebody! Anybody else!

802
01:02:26,923 --> 01:02:30,586
- Please, somebody! Not you!
- Stop moving!

803
01:02:30,693 --> 01:02:34,185
No! Get your filthy
fucking hands off me!

804
01:02:34,297 --> 01:02:38,461
Stop moving. Lady, I'm not
gonna fucking hurt you!

805
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,534
Okay. Okay.

806
01:02:46,643 --> 01:02:48,508
Please don't touch me. Don't, don't.

807
01:02:48,611 --> 01:02:52,377
I'm not gonna touch you.
But there's nobody else here yet

808
01:02:52,515 --> 01:02:54,483
and that's gasoline there.

809
01:02:56,152 --> 01:02:59,417
We need to get you
outta here right away. Okay?

810
01:02:59,522 --> 01:03:01,717
Oh, my... Oh, my...
Oh, my... Oh, my God.

811
01:03:01,825 --> 01:03:07,525
Okay. I need to reach across your lap.
Can I do that, please?

812
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,768
Yeah. Yeah.

813
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:15,831
Thanks.

814
01:03:19,809 --> 01:03:23,575
Is anything broken?

815
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:26,114
I-I don't think so.

816
01:03:26,249 --> 01:03:29,150
Okay. Then that's good.

817
01:03:29,252 --> 01:03:31,743
Are you... Are you
gonna get me out?

818
01:03:31,888 --> 01:03:35,153
Yeah, I'm gonna get you out. Okay?

819
01:03:35,258 --> 01:03:38,591
Look at me. Look at me.
I'm gonna get you out.

820
01:03:44,801 --> 01:03:46,268
Oh, fuck!

821
01:03:46,369 --> 01:03:49,361
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

822
01:03:51,474 --> 01:03:54,272
I'm gonna have to cut your belt, okay?

823
01:03:54,377 --> 01:03:56,470
I'm gonna have to cut the belt.

824
01:03:57,614 --> 01:03:59,081
It's okay, it's okay.

825
01:03:59,215 --> 01:04:01,809
It's okay.
Okay, we're gonna get you out.

826
01:04:01,951 --> 01:04:04,249
Everything's gonna be fine.
Look at me!

827
01:04:04,354 --> 01:04:06,822
Everything's gonna be fine.
We're gonna get you outta here.

828
01:04:06,956 --> 01:04:08,753
Everything's gonna be fine.

829
01:04:25,308 --> 01:04:27,776
Ryan!

830
01:05:03,046 --> 01:05:04,479
Pull!

831
01:05:19,762 --> 01:05:21,059
It's okay.

832
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:31,973
It's okay.

833
01:05:32,942 --> 01:05:36,571
All right.
It's okay, it's okay.

834
01:05:36,679 --> 01:05:39,147
It's all right.
I got it. I got it.

835
01:05:39,282 --> 01:05:41,250
Ma'am? Ma'am,
can you walk with me?

836
01:05:41,384 --> 01:05:43,750
It's cool, it's cool.

837
01:05:45,154 --> 01:05:48,146
Here we go.
All right, you're doin' great.

838
01:06:19,355 --> 01:06:22,552
The D.A. wanted me to apologize.
He really wanted to be here himself.

839
01:06:22,659 --> 01:06:25,389
No, he didn't! If he did his own dirty work
none of us would have jobs.

840
01:06:25,495 --> 01:06:27,759
- Jake Flanagan. I work with Rick.
- Graham Waters.

841
01:06:27,864 --> 01:06:30,697
- Thanks for coming in.
- He just pulled into the garage.

842
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:33,928
Great. Press conference is in ten minutes,
so we'll make this short.

843
01:06:34,037 --> 01:06:37,404
Internal Affairs says this Conklin
has two suspicious shootings on his record.

844
01:06:37,507 --> 01:06:40,772
Both black men.
Both times he was cleared, but only just.

845
01:06:40,877 --> 01:06:43,675
Detective Lewis
makes black man number three.

846
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:47,238
You know any reason why
we shouldn't hang Conklin for this?

847
01:06:47,383 --> 01:06:52,377
Well, it's more complicated
than we originally thought.

848
01:06:52,522 --> 01:06:58,392
We found $300,000 in the trunk of the car
that Detective Lewis was driving.

849
01:06:58,494 --> 01:07:00,553
Shit!

850
01:07:00,663 --> 01:07:05,157
Ah. Go down to the garage. Tell him
to stay in the car until he hears from me.

851
01:07:05,268 --> 01:07:09,170
You found the money in the Mercedes.
I thought that wasn't his car.

852
01:07:09,272 --> 01:07:13,470
The car's registered to a Cindy Bradley.
We haven't been able to get in touch with her.

853
01:07:13,576 --> 01:07:16,704
Apparently she, uh,
left town this morning.

854
01:07:16,813 --> 01:07:20,613
So it wasn't Lewis's car. He may not have
known the money was in it.

855
01:07:27,023 --> 01:07:30,288
You really think you're gonna
be able to make that fly?

856
01:07:31,994 --> 01:07:33,052
Give us a minute.

857
01:07:34,697 --> 01:07:36,858
No problem.

858
01:07:44,374 --> 01:07:46,569
Who knows about the money?

859
01:07:46,676 --> 01:07:48,701
You gotta be kiddin' me.

860
01:07:48,811 --> 01:07:52,679
There are only two people
in this room.

861
01:07:52,815 --> 01:07:56,148
Myself, my partner,
Ferguson and Internal Affairs.

862
01:07:56,252 --> 01:07:58,720
- Jim Ferguson?
- Yeah.

863
01:08:03,259 --> 01:08:05,693
Okay. I guess
I don't see a problem.

864
01:08:05,795 --> 01:08:08,320
As it wasn't Lewis's car, the money isn't
clear evidence of any wrongdoing.

865
01:08:08,431 --> 01:08:11,400
And even if it was, we aren't
going to prosecute a dead man.

866
01:08:11,501 --> 01:08:15,904
Which means the money Internal Affairs
is holding can't be considered evidence.

867
01:08:16,005 --> 01:08:18,303
You can do this dance if you want to,

868
01:08:18,408 --> 01:08:21,866
but I'm willing to bet when the coroner's report
comes back tomorrow

869
01:08:21,978 --> 01:08:24,947
it's going to say that Detective Lewis
was coked out of his head.

870
01:08:26,416 --> 01:08:27,883
Fucking black people, huh?

871
01:08:27,984 --> 01:08:30,009
What did you just say?

872
01:08:30,153 --> 01:08:32,121
I mean,

873
01:08:32,221 --> 01:08:34,712
I know all the sociological
reasons why per capita

874
01:08:34,857 --> 01:08:37,917
eight times more black men
are incarcerated than white men.

875
01:08:38,027 --> 01:08:41,895
Schools are a disgrace. Lack of opportunity.
Bias in the judicial system.

876
01:08:41,998 --> 01:08:43,966
All that stuff.
All that stuff!

877
01:08:44,066 --> 01:08:48,127
But still, it's gotta get to you,
on a gut level as a black man,

878
01:08:48,237 --> 01:08:51,172
they just can't keep their hands
out of the cookie jar.

879
01:08:56,412 --> 01:08:58,505
Of course, you and I
know that's not the truth.

880
01:08:58,614 --> 01:09:00,605
But that's the way
it always plays, doesn't it?

881
01:09:00,750 --> 01:09:04,186
And assholes like Lewis keep
feeding the flames. It's gotta get to you.

882
01:09:05,455 --> 01:09:07,753
What did you say
you did for the D.A. again?

883
01:09:07,857 --> 01:09:09,825
You coach ball down in Compton.
Am I right?

884
01:09:09,926 --> 01:09:11,860
Oh, please, don't do that.

885
01:09:12,662 --> 01:09:14,789
Don't act like you know
something about me, okay?

886
01:09:14,897 --> 01:09:19,300
What do you think those kids need...
to make them believe, to give them hope?

887
01:09:19,402 --> 01:09:21,563
You think they need another
drug-dealing cop

888
01:09:21,671 --> 01:09:24,606
or do you think they need
a fallen black hero?

889
01:09:24,707 --> 01:09:29,303
Why don't you cut through the bullshit
and just tell me what it is you want.

890
01:09:31,314 --> 01:09:34,112
The D.A.'s squad loses
its lead investigator next month.

891
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:38,118
Rick is quite adamant
that his replacement be a person of color.

892
01:09:38,221 --> 01:09:42,385
It's a high-profile position, and he wants
to send the right message to the community.

893
01:09:42,492 --> 01:09:46,155
And the right message is,
"Look at this black boy I just bought?"

894
01:09:46,262 --> 01:09:49,857
Well, fuck you very much.
But thanks for thinking of me.

895
01:09:51,234 --> 01:09:53,634
Actually we were thinking of you.

896
01:09:55,004 --> 01:09:56,995
Until we saw that.

897
01:09:57,940 --> 01:09:59,134
It's your brother's file.

898
01:10:00,142 --> 01:10:02,372
Twenty-something years old
and already three felonies.

899
01:10:02,478 --> 01:10:05,174
Three strikes law. Kid's going away
for life for stealing a car.

900
01:10:05,314 --> 01:10:07,976
Christ, that's a shitty law.

901
01:10:08,117 --> 01:10:10,051
There's a warrant in there.

902
01:10:10,152 --> 01:10:14,486
But still, hey, he had
every opportunity you had.

903
01:10:17,326 --> 01:10:19,226
Fucking black people, huh?

904
01:10:23,599 --> 01:10:28,036
So all, uh... all I need to do
to make this disappear

905
01:10:28,137 --> 01:10:30,435
is to frame
a potentially innocent man?

906
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:33,839
What are you? The fucking defender
of all things white?

907
01:10:33,943 --> 01:10:37,674
We're talking about a white man
who shot three black men.

908
01:10:37,780 --> 01:10:42,513
And you're arguing with me that maybe
we're not being fair to him?

909
01:10:42,652 --> 01:10:45,621
You know what? Maybe you're right.
Maybe Lewis did provoke this.

910
01:10:45,721 --> 01:10:47,882
And maybe he got exactly
what was coming to him.

911
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:50,982
Or maybe stoned or not,
just being a black man in the Valley

912
01:10:51,093 --> 01:10:53,425
was enough to get him killed.

913
01:10:53,529 --> 01:10:57,590
There was no one there to see who shot first,
so there is no way to know.

914
01:10:57,700 --> 01:11:01,067
Which means we
could get this wrong.

915
01:11:02,939 --> 01:11:05,999
Maybe that's what happened with
your brother. Maybe we got it wrong.

916
01:11:06,108 --> 01:11:10,568
Maybe Lewis isn't the only one
who deserves the benefit of the doubt.

917
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:13,243
You're the one closest to all this.

918
01:11:13,382 --> 01:11:15,145
You need to tell us.

919
01:11:18,988 --> 01:11:21,422
What does your gut tell you?

920
01:11:34,203 --> 01:11:37,366
So? Graham?

921
01:11:37,473 --> 01:11:39,600
What do I tell 'em?

922
01:11:39,709 --> 01:11:43,611
You tell me, and I'll tell them.

923
01:11:50,286 --> 01:11:54,450
Well, I think given
Detective Conklin's history,

924
01:11:54,557 --> 01:11:57,617
it's pretty clear
what happened last night.

925
01:11:57,727 --> 01:12:00,287
Okay.

926
01:12:16,912 --> 01:12:19,176
Before I get to why we're here,

927
01:12:19,315 --> 01:12:23,251
I know that many of you have heard
we had our car stolen last night.

928
01:12:23,352 --> 01:12:27,721
And as you could imagine, my wife and I
are both pretty shaken up.

929
01:12:27,823 --> 01:12:29,654
But we're okay.

930
01:12:29,759 --> 01:12:34,389
And Jean and I truly appreciate all your calls
and your concern. Thank you.

931
01:12:34,497 --> 01:12:40,094
Now, just after 9:00 p.m. last night,
Detective William Lewis,

932
01:12:40,202 --> 01:12:43,365
an eight-year veteran of the force
and an active member of the black community,

933
01:12:43,472 --> 01:12:45,702
was gunned down
by a fellow officer.

934
01:13:46,202 --> 01:13:47,396
Get outta the car!

935
01:13:47,503 --> 01:13:49,368
Gimme the keys!
Get out... What the fuck?

936
01:13:51,373 --> 01:13:53,398
Whoa! What the fuck
are you doing, man?

937
01:13:53,509 --> 01:13:55,374
Shit! You wanna get killed, nigger?

938
01:13:55,478 --> 01:13:56,376
Say that again!

939
01:13:58,481 --> 01:14:00,676
- Say that again!
- You stupid motherfucker!

940
01:14:00,816 --> 01:14:04,115
Say it again, huh!
Call me a nigger again!

941
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:06,586
- Man, what the fuck? Get off!
- Fuck you!

942
01:14:06,689 --> 01:14:09,522
- Shoot him!
- I'll blow your head off!

943
01:14:09,625 --> 01:14:12,685
- Shoot this motherfucker!
- I swear to God, I'm gonna blow your head off!

944
01:14:12,795 --> 01:14:13,921
Stop talkin' and shoot!

945
01:14:15,297 --> 01:14:18,164
- Stop! Let's go! Here comes the po-po.
- Get off of me!

946
01:14:20,269 --> 01:14:23,033
Hey, hey! Where you goin', man? Hell, no!

947
01:14:23,139 --> 01:14:25,107
- Oh, shit.
- Anthony! Anthony!

948
01:14:27,676 --> 01:14:28,938
Get the fuck outta my car!

949
01:14:29,044 --> 01:14:31,308
Shit! Damn!

950
01:14:31,413 --> 01:14:33,608
- What are you doin', man? Get outta the car!
- Fuck you!

951
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:40,953
Car 25 in pursuit of a black Navigator.
West bound.

952
01:14:41,724 --> 01:14:43,919
I will blow you away!
Get the fuck out of the car!

953
01:14:44,026 --> 01:14:45,459
Go on! Shoot me then!

954
01:14:47,196 --> 01:14:51,530
2-2 Ida Tom Adam 3...
Oh, Christ!

955
01:14:57,106 --> 01:14:59,301
- Get the fuck outta the car!
- You get the fuck outta the car!

956
01:14:59,408 --> 01:15:01,774
- Get outta the fucking car!
- It's my fucking car!

957
01:15:01,877 --> 01:15:04,243
- It's my fucking gun!
- Fuck, it's my gun now!

958
01:15:04,346 --> 01:15:06,541
Gimme my fucking gun!

959
01:15:13,889 --> 01:15:15,652
Fuck!

960
01:15:17,426 --> 01:15:21,328
Hands in plain sight!
Step out of the vehicle!

961
01:15:24,233 --> 01:15:28,226
Hands in plain sight!
Step out of the vehicle!

962
01:15:31,507 --> 01:15:34,067
Slowly step out of the vehicle.

963
01:15:34,176 --> 01:15:37,873
- Get out of my car.
- You so brave, you get outta the car, man.

964
01:15:40,983 --> 01:15:44,783
Turn off the engine.
Throw the keys out the window.

965
01:15:57,433 --> 01:16:00,766
You fucking want me?
Here I am, you pig fuck!

966
01:16:00,870 --> 01:16:02,235
Lie face down on the ground.

967
01:16:02,338 --> 01:16:05,000
- Spread your arms and legs.
- No, you lie face down!

968
01:16:05,107 --> 01:16:07,200
Don't come any closer!
Down on your knees!

969
01:16:07,309 --> 01:16:09,777
Fuck you! What are you gonna do?
Pull the fucking trigger!

970
01:16:09,879 --> 01:16:10,811
On your knees now!

971
01:16:10,913 --> 01:16:13,643
You get on your knees
and suck my fucking dick!

972
01:16:13,782 --> 01:16:16,478
Do I look like
I'm fucking joking with you?

973
01:16:16,619 --> 01:16:18,143
That's what you look like,
a fucking joke to me.

974
01:16:18,287 --> 01:16:20,482
- This man is making threatening gestures.
- Threatening gestures?

975
01:16:20,589 --> 01:16:22,921
You wanna see a threatening gesture?
I got a threatening gesture.

976
01:16:23,025 --> 01:16:26,722
- I know this man! I know this man!
- Get back.

977
01:16:26,829 --> 01:16:29,354
- Give me some space. I know this guy.
- Get outta the way.

978
01:16:29,465 --> 01:16:30,557
Step away.

979
01:16:30,666 --> 01:16:32,691
Give me some goddamn room.
I know this guy.

980
01:16:34,570 --> 01:16:37,130
- Man, don't walk up on me!
- See what's happening here?

981
01:16:37,239 --> 01:16:39,434
Do you wanna die here, huh?
Is that what you want?

982
01:16:39,541 --> 01:16:41,509
'Cause these guys
really wanna shoot you.

983
01:16:41,610 --> 01:16:44,170
And the way you're acting,
they'll be completely fucking justified.

984
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:45,508
Fuck you!

985
01:16:45,614 --> 01:16:48,913
Fuck me? I'm not the one who's fucked here.
You're the one.

986
01:16:49,051 --> 01:16:51,918
'Cause you're the one
whose head's gonna be blown off!

987
01:16:52,021 --> 01:16:53,283
Officer Hanson, step away.

988
01:16:53,389 --> 01:16:56,847
He's a friend of mine, okay? He's a fucking
friend! This man is not armed!

989
01:16:56,992 --> 01:16:59,893
He's not gonna shoot you, me,
or anybody else, all right?

990
01:16:59,995 --> 01:17:02,020
So give me two goddamn seconds.
Can you do that?

991
01:17:02,131 --> 01:17:05,396
Lower your firearm.
Lower your firearm!

992
01:17:10,606 --> 01:17:13,871
You startin' to understand
the situation?

993
01:17:13,976 --> 01:17:16,638
What do you want from me?

994
01:17:16,745 --> 01:17:21,273
Unless you think your wife is better off with
a husband who has a bloody stump for a head,

995
01:17:21,417 --> 01:17:23,317
I want you to sit on that curb,
put your hands on your head

996
01:17:23,419 --> 01:17:25,649
and do nothing until I speak with these officers.

997
01:17:25,754 --> 01:17:28,723
I'm not sittin' on no curb, I'm not puttin'
my hands on my head for nobody.

998
01:17:28,857 --> 01:17:32,850
Then stand where you are and keep your
hands in sight. Can you do that, huh?

999
01:17:35,931 --> 01:17:38,092
Yeah, I can do that.

1000
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:40,430
Good.

1001
01:17:40,536 --> 01:17:44,336
I told this man to stay where he is and keep his
hands in plain sight.

1002
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:49,207
This man better be related to you by blood
because this is fucking nuts.

1003
01:17:49,311 --> 01:17:51,404
I need this favor.

1004
01:17:51,513 --> 01:17:55,540
You can check the guy's name, his license.
He's got no priors, no warrants.

1005
01:17:55,684 --> 01:17:58,209
I need to let him go
with a warning.

1006
01:17:58,354 --> 01:18:03,223
- What kind of fucking warning?
- A harsh warning.

1007
01:18:05,794 --> 01:18:07,659
Thank you.

1008
01:18:10,532 --> 01:18:14,559
You've been warned. Do you understand me?
Do you understand me!

1009
01:18:14,670 --> 01:18:17,935
You want something from me?
'Cause I'm right here.

1010
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:22,067
- I'm trying to help you.
- I didn't ask for your help, did I?

1011
01:18:24,213 --> 01:18:26,408
Go home.

1012
01:18:30,085 --> 01:18:32,417
Yeah, that I can do.

1013
01:19:50,999 --> 01:19:52,899
Look at me.

1014
01:19:54,369 --> 01:19:57,031
You embarrass me.

1015
01:19:57,139 --> 01:19:59,232
You embarrass yourself.

1016
01:20:42,417 --> 01:20:43,384
Daddy's home!

1017
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:05,297
- What's up?
- Give me my money!

1018
01:21:05,407 --> 01:21:07,841
- What? What money?
- Daddy!

1019
01:21:07,943 --> 01:21:11,208
- To pay for my store. Give me my money!
- Honey, stay inside. Elizabeth!

1020
01:21:11,313 --> 01:21:12,803
Give me my money!

1021
01:21:14,383 --> 01:21:17,443
- I want my fucking money! Give me that truck!
- That's not my truck!

1022
01:21:17,586 --> 01:21:19,918
- Daddy?
- Elizabeth!

1023
01:21:20,022 --> 01:21:24,288
Hey, you know what?
Hey, I got $50. Here.

1024
01:21:24,393 --> 01:21:26,452
Fifty dollars?
You took everything!

1025
01:21:26,562 --> 01:21:27,221
Mommy?

1026
01:21:28,997 --> 01:21:30,589
I'm coming, I'm coming!

1027
01:21:30,699 --> 01:21:34,897
- He doesn't have it.
- Hasn't got what?

1028
01:21:35,003 --> 01:21:39,235
I have it. He doesn't
have the impenetrable cloak!

1029
01:21:40,442 --> 01:21:42,069
Lara, stay outta the street!

1030
01:22:09,705 --> 01:22:13,368
- It's okay, Daddy.
- What... What?

1031
01:22:13,475 --> 01:22:14,908
I'll protect you.

1032
01:22:42,204 --> 01:22:44,866
It's okay. Daddy's okay.

1033
01:22:44,973 --> 01:22:47,999
It's a really good cloak.

1034
01:23:55,077 --> 01:24:00,037
I sent her out for groceries,
and that was two hours ago, Carol.

1035
01:24:00,182 --> 01:24:02,047
Well, you are one to talk.

1036
01:24:02,150 --> 01:24:06,018
You go through, like,
six housekeepers a year?

1037
01:24:06,121 --> 01:24:09,522
I'm not snapping at you!
I am angry.

1038
01:24:10,792 --> 01:24:12,851
Yes! At them! Yes!

1039
01:24:12,961 --> 01:24:17,295
At them, the police,
at Rick, at Maria,

1040
01:24:17,399 --> 01:24:21,096
at the dry cleaners who destroyed
another blouse today,

1041
01:24:21,203 --> 01:24:25,162
at the gardener who keeps
overwatering the lawn.

1042
01:24:25,273 --> 01:24:26,433
I...

1043
01:24:27,676 --> 01:24:30,201
I just thought that...

1044
01:24:30,312 --> 01:24:33,839
Carol, I just thought that
I would wake up today

1045
01:24:33,982 --> 01:24:36,951
and I would feel better, you know?

1046
01:24:37,052 --> 01:24:41,011
But I was still mad.
And I realized...

1047
01:24:41,156 --> 01:24:45,058
I realized that it had nothing
to do with my car being stolen.

1048
01:24:47,095 --> 01:24:50,861
I wake up like this
every morning!

1049
01:24:50,966 --> 01:24:54,925
I am angry all the time,
and I don't know why.

1050
01:24:55,036 --> 01:24:58,369
Carol, I don't know why! And I...

1051
01:25:00,041 --> 01:25:03,101
Yeah, yeah, call me back.

1052
01:25:03,211 --> 01:25:05,076
Bye.

1053
01:26:56,258 --> 01:26:58,226
Really appreciate this.

1054
01:26:58,326 --> 01:27:00,521
You're welcome.

1055
01:27:06,368 --> 01:27:08,268
So how long you been out there tonight?
It's cold.

1056
01:27:08,370 --> 01:27:10,497
Hour maybe.

1057
01:27:10,605 --> 01:27:12,402
Big surprise, huh?

1058
01:27:12,507 --> 01:27:15,772
Yeah, this ain't exactly
"pick up a brother" territory.

1059
01:27:15,877 --> 01:27:17,640
True.

1060
01:27:17,746 --> 01:27:19,714
So where you headed?

1061
01:27:19,848 --> 01:27:21,975
Anywhere the other side
of the hill.

1062
01:27:25,420 --> 01:27:27,684
That's some good music.

1063
01:27:27,789 --> 01:27:29,689
Mm-hmm.

1064
01:27:29,791 --> 01:27:33,192
No, really.
I'm startin' to understand it.

1065
01:27:33,295 --> 01:27:36,355
Wrote me a country song
myself just yesterday.

1066
01:27:36,464 --> 01:27:38,659
I'll bet you did.

1067
01:27:54,015 --> 01:27:56,245
So what was goin' on
in the Valley tonight?

1068
01:27:56,384 --> 01:27:58,011
Ice-skatin'.

1069
01:27:59,187 --> 01:28:00,211
Ice-skatin'.

1070
01:28:00,355 --> 01:28:02,915
Love the ice-skatin'.

1071
01:28:03,024 --> 01:28:06,653
When I was a kid,
I always wanted to be a goalie.

1072
01:28:06,761 --> 01:28:08,353
Come on!

1073
01:28:08,463 --> 01:28:11,728
What, you... you think
that's funny or somethin'?

1074
01:28:11,833 --> 01:28:13,858
I think you're having fun.

1075
01:28:13,969 --> 01:28:15,960
Yeah. Whatever.

1076
01:28:25,780 --> 01:28:26,747
Something else funny?

1077
01:28:26,881 --> 01:28:29,145
Oh, yeah.

1078
01:28:31,486 --> 01:28:33,283
Yeah? What's that?

1079
01:28:33,388 --> 01:28:35,151
People, man. People.

1080
01:28:36,324 --> 01:28:38,224
People like me.

1081
01:28:39,861 --> 01:28:42,352
No, no, no, no.
I'm not laughin' at you, man.

1082
01:28:43,365 --> 01:28:44,332
I can see that.

1083
01:28:44,432 --> 01:28:48,129
- Why don't you laugh outside?
- Why are you gettin' all bent outta shape?

1084
01:28:48,236 --> 01:28:50,966
I'm not gettin' bent, man.
Just pulling over.

1085
01:28:53,475 --> 01:28:57,571
Come on, man, keep drivin'.
I said I'm not laughing at you.

1086
01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:00,079
And I'm not telling you
to get the fuck out of my car.

1087
01:29:00,181 --> 01:29:02,741
Why you bein' a fucking jerk?
Just drive the car.

1088
01:29:02,884 --> 01:29:04,749
I've got a better idea.
Get out now.

1089
01:29:04,853 --> 01:29:06,445
Fine. You want me
to show you? I'll show you.

1090
01:29:06,588 --> 01:29:09,216
Get your hands out of your pocket.
Put your hands where I can see 'em.

1091
01:29:09,324 --> 01:29:11,315
- Who the fuck you think you're talkin' to?
- Put your hands where I can see!

1092
01:29:11,426 --> 01:29:14,327
You wanna see what's in my hands?
I'll show you what's in my fuckin' hands!

1093
01:29:50,565 --> 01:29:53,261
Oh, God.

1094
01:30:27,736 --> 01:30:32,139
Thank you, Brother Merle.
That was Merle Haggard on KYHA.

1095
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:34,333
The scene of country music
here in L.A.

1096
01:30:34,442 --> 01:30:36,637
It's a cold night,
and it's getting colder.

1097
01:30:36,745 --> 01:30:40,738
We're giving out tickets to the rodeo coming
to the Fairplex in Pomona.

1098
01:30:44,319 --> 01:30:48,551
- Hey, you okay?
- I'm freezin'.

1099
01:30:48,656 --> 01:30:51,625
Shit. I heard it might snow.

1100
01:30:51,726 --> 01:30:54,058
- Get outta here.
- That's what I heard.

1101
01:30:54,162 --> 01:30:57,427
- You got a smoke?
- Nah. I quit.

1102
01:30:57,532 --> 01:30:59,693
Yeah, me too.

1103
01:30:59,801 --> 01:31:05,000
- What do you got?
- Dead kid.

1104
01:31:05,106 --> 01:31:07,597
Hey, Bob.

1105
01:32:34,696 --> 01:32:37,722
Choi Jin Gui! Choi Jin Gui!

1106
01:32:37,832 --> 01:32:40,733
- Choi Jin Gui! Choi Jin Gui!
- Do you speak English?

1107
01:32:40,835 --> 01:32:44,828
I am speaking English, you stupid cow!
My husband name Choi Jin Gui!

1108
01:32:47,075 --> 01:32:48,633
- Jin Gui!
- Ma'am!

1109
01:32:48,743 --> 01:32:51,940
Kim Lee.

1110
01:32:57,886 --> 01:33:02,016
I thought you were dead.
I called every hospital.

1111
01:33:02,123 --> 01:33:03,886
It's okay. I'm okay.

1112
01:33:03,992 --> 01:33:06,790
Thank you for finding me.

1113
01:33:09,497 --> 01:33:12,989
- Will you do something for me?
- Anything.

1114
01:33:13,101 --> 01:33:14,864
Go to the locker.

1115
01:33:19,073 --> 01:33:21,007
No, next one.

1116
01:33:24,078 --> 01:33:26,842
In my wallet, there's a check.

1117
01:33:26,981 --> 01:33:29,108
Bring it here.

1118
01:33:37,125 --> 01:33:40,356
Oh, I get it. When I said get me
a black Lincoln Navigator,

1119
01:33:40,461 --> 01:33:43,828
you thought I said get me
a white piece of shit panel van.

1120
01:33:43,932 --> 01:33:48,960
- Fine, fine. Just give me whatever for it.
- You should see this.

1121
01:34:05,019 --> 01:34:07,010
I'll take the van.

1122
01:34:08,089 --> 01:34:09,386
They're chained to the van.

1123
01:34:09,490 --> 01:34:11,082
So I'll take them too.

1124
01:34:12,527 --> 01:34:14,518
You wanna buy these Chinamen?

1125
01:34:14,629 --> 01:34:17,154
Don't be ignorant.
They're Thai or Cambodian.

1126
01:34:17,265 --> 01:34:18,994
Entirely different kind of chinks.

1127
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:22,194
- What the hell are you gonna do with 'em?
- Sell 'em. What you think?

1128
01:34:22,303 --> 01:34:26,637
I'll give you 500 apiece,
and you can keep the van.

1129
01:34:44,792 --> 01:34:47,761
Oh, no!

1130
01:34:51,499 --> 01:34:53,763
No! No!

1131
01:35:09,884 --> 01:35:11,818
This is Dorri.

1132
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:21,755
Oh.

1133
01:35:21,863 --> 01:35:24,195
Oh. Mmm, mmm, mmm.

1134
01:35:24,298 --> 01:35:28,496
My baby. My poor baby!

1135
01:35:30,772 --> 01:35:32,603
Mom.

1136
01:35:33,341 --> 01:35:38,005
I promise you... I promise I'm gonna
find out who did this, Mom.

1137
01:35:39,914 --> 01:35:42,678
Oh, I already know.

1138
01:35:44,685 --> 01:35:46,414
You did.

1139
01:35:48,756 --> 01:35:53,386
I asked you to find your brother,
but you were busy.

1140
01:35:53,494 --> 01:35:57,294
We weren't much good
to you anymore, were we?

1141
01:36:01,669 --> 01:36:04,638
You got things to do. You go ahead.
I'll sign the papers.

1142
01:36:04,739 --> 01:36:06,639
I wanna stay.

1143
01:36:06,741 --> 01:36:10,404
I just wanna wait
with my baby.

1144
01:36:21,122 --> 01:36:22,089
He came home.

1145
01:36:23,157 --> 01:36:25,091
Did you know that?

1146
01:36:25,193 --> 01:36:28,026
My little boy.

1147
01:36:28,129 --> 01:36:29,926
When I was sleepin',

1148
01:36:30,031 --> 01:36:33,091
he brought me groceries.

1149
01:36:33,201 --> 01:36:35,192
It's the last thing he did.

1150
01:37:14,509 --> 01:37:16,500
What happened?

1151
01:37:23,050 --> 01:37:24,915
What did you do?

1152
01:37:26,020 --> 01:37:28,545
What did you do?

1153
01:37:30,758 --> 01:37:32,692
I shoot a little girl.

1154
01:37:32,793 --> 01:37:35,023
What?

1155
01:37:35,129 --> 01:37:37,927
No, she's okay. She's...

1156
01:37:39,567 --> 01:37:41,797
She's... Here.

1157
01:37:41,903 --> 01:37:47,034
The gun shoot her,
but she's okay, Dorri.

1158
01:37:47,141 --> 01:37:50,133
Nothing happened.

1159
01:37:51,846 --> 01:37:53,074
She's my...

1160
01:37:54,749 --> 01:37:56,512
What are you
talking about, Daddy?

1161
01:38:00,288 --> 01:38:02,085
My angel.

1162
01:38:04,225 --> 01:38:06,159
My angel!

1163
01:38:07,962 --> 01:38:10,658
She came to protect me.

1164
01:38:11,966 --> 01:38:14,366
To protect us!

1165
01:38:16,103 --> 01:38:17,900
You understand?

1166
01:38:22,243 --> 01:38:24,268
Take this. Please.

1167
01:38:25,846 --> 01:38:27,746
Take it.

1168
01:38:32,153 --> 01:38:34,621
Hey! Hey!

1169
01:38:34,755 --> 01:38:38,384
Everything is okay, Dorri.

1170
01:38:38,492 --> 01:38:40,221
It's okay.

1171
01:38:45,266 --> 01:38:46,893
Okay, Daddy.

1172
01:38:47,001 --> 01:38:48,593
Okay.

1173
01:39:12,059 --> 01:39:13,026
Jean?

1174
01:39:13,127 --> 01:39:15,152
- Rick?
- Yeah. What's wrong.

1175
01:39:15,263 --> 01:39:17,891
I fell down the stairs.

1176
01:39:17,999 --> 01:39:21,332
- Are you all right?
- I tried calling you.

1177
01:39:21,435 --> 01:39:24,632
I couldn't get through
to anyone. Not...

1178
01:39:24,739 --> 01:39:28,175
Not Kath, not Marge, not Julie.

1179
01:39:28,276 --> 01:39:31,006
I'm getting in the elevator. I'll be in my car.
I'll be home in 20 minutes.

1180
01:39:31,112 --> 01:39:34,104
It's okay. Maria drove me to emergency.
It's just a bad sprain.

1181
01:39:34,248 --> 01:39:36,682
Carol was the only one
that was home and

1182
01:39:36,784 --> 01:39:40,413
she said she couldn't come get me because
she was getting a massage.

1183
01:39:40,554 --> 01:39:42,920
That's because she's a bitch.

1184
01:39:43,024 --> 01:39:45,891
She's been my friend for ten years.

1185
01:39:47,061 --> 01:39:48,961
All right, honey.
Feel better.

1186
01:39:49,063 --> 01:39:51,327
I'll be there soon.

1187
01:39:53,534 --> 01:39:55,434
I love you.

1188
01:39:55,536 --> 01:39:57,766
I love you too.

1189
01:40:20,027 --> 01:40:22,120
Miss Jean.

1190
01:40:24,165 --> 01:40:26,793
Would you like to sit up?

1191
01:40:32,473 --> 01:40:35,670
Here. Good!

1192
01:40:44,318 --> 01:40:46,479
Do you wanna hear
something funny?

1193
01:40:46,620 --> 01:40:48,554
What, Mrs. Jean?

1194
01:40:50,391 --> 01:40:53,121
You're the best friend I've got.

1195
01:44:07,254 --> 01:44:08,721
Hi.

1196
01:44:09,290 --> 01:44:11,053
Hi.

1197
01:44:16,597 --> 01:44:17,723
I love you.

1198
01:45:47,588 --> 01:45:49,488
All right.

1199
01:45:49,590 --> 01:45:52,855
Everybody out, man.
You're free to go.

1200
01:45:55,796 --> 01:45:58,094
All right, come on.

1201
01:45:58,198 --> 01:46:01,531
Come on now! This is America.
Time is money. Chop, chop!

1202
01:46:01,635 --> 01:46:03,227
Come on, y'all.

1203
01:46:06,540 --> 01:46:08,167
Come on.

1204
01:46:32,700 --> 01:46:34,725
That's $40.

1205
01:46:34,835 --> 01:46:37,827
Buy everybody chop suey.
You understand?

1206
01:46:39,239 --> 01:46:41,707
Dopey fucking Chinaman.

1207
01:47:12,740 --> 01:47:14,503
Aah! Oh, my God!

1208
01:47:14,608 --> 01:47:16,701
What the hell is wrong with you?

1209
01:47:18,412 --> 01:47:21,973
Uh-uh! Don't talk to me
unless you speak American!
