But they were wrong. I do not know. I do not know what happens...

Billy is. They are about it. We have not done anything that we have not ...

45
00:05:07,968 --> 00:05:10,820
done before. I want a team on the move now!

46
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,157
Go to the cement factory. HornlinkWay,

47
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:18,594
toward the docks. I put it on your GPS.

48
00:05:18,595 --> 00:05:20,596
- Just follow the route. - Agree.

49
00:05:21,481 --> 00:05:24,200
The route to the destination has been calculated.

50
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:32,842
They go to the docks.

Quite romantic.

52
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:47,940
Turn left at the next corner.

53
00:06:02,222 --> 00:06:03,489
Move it, move!

54
00:06:05,992 --> 00:06:07,610
The outside looks clear, sir.

55
00:06:27,063 --> 00:06:28,964
- This is not the cement factory. - What?

56
00:06:29,065 --> 00:06:33,035
- That this is not the cement factory! - HornlinkWay, it is.

57
00:06:33,036 --> 00:06:35,754
- The GPS does not lie, my friend. - Spin.

58
00:07:28,074 --> 00:07:29,074
Shit!

59
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:57,052
- We have it? - We have nothing sir. There is nobody here.

60
00:07:58,371 --> 00:08:02,124
Give me a position on that phone number. Find him now!

61
00:08:18,441 --> 00:08:23,045
If you have never been to a slaughterhouse ... you should go.

62
00:08:23,696 --> 00:08:26,848
To see what we do to those poor animals.

63
00:08:29,902 --> 00:08:33,355
We use this as a form ...

64
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:37,209
unpleasant to take them to the limit.

65
00:08:48,905 --> 00:08:50,689
Where is our friend then?

66
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:59,565
Billy ... I respect your silence. For real.

67
00:09:01,566 --> 00:09:05,520
The problem is that I need to Dutch.

68
00:09:06,506 --> 00:09:09,491
- Last chance. - Fuck you, crazy!

69
00:09:32,932 --> 00:09:34,983
Come on. Move it, move!

70
00:09:38,271 --> 00:09:39,271
We walked in silence.

71
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,642
set input. We're right outside, sir.

72
00:09:44,343 --> 00:09:47,162
Check on the right. Revised, it is clear

73
00:09:48,164 --> 00:09:49,314
Bravo, she understood.

74
00:09:53,219 --> 00:09:54,369
Come on, come on, come on!

75
00:09:57,223 --> 00:09:58,924
Objective located. We need a doctor.

76
00:09:59,258 --> 00:10:00,525
Confirmed, it is the Pope agent.

77
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,227
I secured perimeter.

78
00:10:03,963 --> 00:10:07,682
The agent does not respond repeat, the agent does not respond.

79
00:10:09,285 --> 00:10:10,552
Achievement not get to breathe.

80
00:10:12,421 --> 00:10:14,021
Does not respond to my request.

81
00:10:14,473 --> 00:10:16,608
Ready to defibrillate. Loading pallets.

82
00:10:17,226 --> 00:10:18,226
Clear!

83
00:10:21,347 --> 00:10:22,347
Clear!

84
00:10:23,566 --> 00:10:24,649
He's dead, sir.

85
00:10:25,901 --> 00:10:26,901
Dammit!

86
00:10:42,485 --> 00:10:45,820
Doctor, I'm so sorry but this man claims to work for the government.

87
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:54,062
Dr. Franks. I have a job at the moment ... which is to put it in a ...

88
00:10:54,063 --> 00:10:57,399
Airbus A-100, comfortably seated as soon as possible.

89
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,219
Its program memory will be executed. We have an officer down and we need ...

90
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,604
what only he knew.

91
00:11:03,406 --> 00:11:06,591
- You get it back for us. - Do you have some brain activity?

92
00:11:11,464 --> 00:11:15,049
- That was taken a few days ago - I find to five years away ...

93
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:18,052
- Of human testing. - You have 48 hours to make it work.

94
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:20,905
Threat to national security worst level.

95
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:26,377
Can or not retrieve memories of a dead person to a living?

96
00:11:26,745 --> 00:11:29,047
- Yes, what do you need?

97
00:11:29,381 --> 00:11:34,252
My team, my staff, a container, we reach the safe end.

98
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:38,289
- Do you have a candidate? - It's not like it.

PRISON OF THE UNITED STATES WEST VIRGINIA WAZELTON

100
00:11:45,865 --> 00:11:47,732
I just hope he knows what he does.

101
00:11:49,301 --> 00:11:51,553
Stuart Jericho. He has been in and out of prison over the ...

102
00:11:51,554 --> 00:11:56,324
half of his life. He has no impulse control, sense of proportion.

103
00:11:56,325 --> 00:12:00,945
He is unable to estimate the potential consequential damage of their actions.

104
00:12:01,363 --> 00:12:04,048
It has a total lack of empathy for anyone or anything.

105
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,600
Feels nothing. No hate ...

106
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:17,211
no love. But it gets worse.

107
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:22,533
This is what was the member of a band I tried to recruit him.

108
00:12:24,436 --> 00:12:28,790
Having done this, there is no way to discipline. You can not punish ...

109
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,992
someone who does not know you did something wrong.

110
00:12:32,444 --> 00:12:36,414
The society does not understand or is assumed that people should behave.

111
00:12:46,325 --> 00:12:47,325
Come on!

112
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,343
- Hello Jericho. - Come on!

113
00:12:50,546 --> 00:12:52,196
These men have come to see you.

114
00:12:56,435 --> 00:12:57,518
You take out.

115
00:13:02,424 --> 00:13:06,527
- I have not eaten lunch. - True. Get him his lunch to Jericho.

116
00:13:06,528 --> 00:13:07,979
- Yeah. - Send lunch.

117
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,282
So is. Get him to Jericho lunch.

118
00:13:13,185 --> 00:13:14,185
Lunch at the hole.

119
00:13:22,995 --> 00:13:25,196
Well, enough of this. Trash. lunch is over.

120
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,750
You come with us now. Come on.

121
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:36,140
I have a chain around my neck.

122
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,681
You know you have to use more than that.

123
00:13:56,511 --> 00:14:00,014
Damned. They are accursed.

124
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
Expect.

125
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:07,271
Open the cell.

126

Special helicopter G-EMH, is authorized to approach runway 22-L.

127
00:14:23,355 --> 00:14:24,572

AIR FORCE BASE DOVER DELAWARE

129
00:14:43,475 --> 00:14:44,775
Take him to the doctor this.

130
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:37,778
- Do you have allergies. Jericho? - What?

131
00:15:37,946 --> 00:15:41,165
- Something that is allergic - Yes to closure..

132
00:15:41,999 --> 00:15:46,086
- The good or bad? - You tell me.

133
00:15:46,554 --> 00:15:50,024
- Is everything ready, doctor. - Some previous surgeries?

134
00:15:50,525 --> 00:15:51,576
Does past?

135
00:15:55,981 --> 00:15:59,917
- Inyéctenle 150mg Hidrozepina. - It is understood. Yes sir.

136
00:16:00,952 --> 00:16:02,136
What are you doing to me?

137
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:17,751
He had a wound on his head. He was hurt when he was young.

138
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,356
You remember how it happened?

139
00:16:22,657 --> 00:16:25,693
Yes. My mother told my dad ...

140
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:27,596
he was not my father.

141
00:16:28,597 --> 00:16:32,299
So he called her a bitch and throw myself out the window of the car.

142
00:16:35,336 --> 00:16:37,571
I'll take care. Jericho.

143
00:16:39,724 --> 00:16:43,177
My next guest is Xavier Heimdhal, best known as the founder of ...

144
00:16:43,178 --> 00:16:46,330
Industries Stone Harp. Manufacturers of phones, computers and ...

145
00:16:46,331 --> 00:16:50,050
comunication system. He was recently accused of treason by ...

146
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:54,788
Spanish government Heimdhal Lord, how do you respond to these serious allegations?

147
00:16:55,123 --> 00:16:58,224
Well, betrayal if denounce corruption

148
00:16:58,236 --> 00:17:00,727
mass at the highest levels ...

149
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,964
and expose political assassinations ...

150
00:17:04,265 --> 00:17:06,800
yes, I am guilty.

151
00:17:06,918 --> 00:17:10,587
But his accusations were never really tested in court.

152
00:17:10,688 --> 00:17:13,974
Of course not. How could that be?

153
00:17:14,775 --> 00:17:17,361
Police, judges and courts are ...

154
00:17:17,362 --> 00:17:21,181
all part of the most powerful criminal enterprise in the world.

155
00:17:21,182 --> 00:17:25,536
So to summarize, he is calling for the overthrow of the Spanish government

156
00:17:25,537 --> 00:17:27,955
I'm not calling for the overthrow of all

157
00:17:27,967 --> 00:17:30,073
the governments. Politicians, fans ...

158
00:17:30,074 --> 00:17:34,278
religious that they wash the brains corporations. Corruption ...

159
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:37,164
deleted banking system. removed

160
00:17:37,479 --> 00:17:40,618
Washington, Berlin, Beijing. Would cemeteries.

161
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:43,871
Only then people might understand that there is a way ..

162
00:17:43,872 --> 00:17:46,758
Better to rule this world. And that's what you really want.

163
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:51,829
- A revolution worldwide. - Governments must fall.

164
00:17:52,915 --> 00:17:56,868
I have one. Elsa belonged to German Special Forces.

165
00:17:57,269 --> 00:17:59,269
- One of Heimdhal. - People, you have to move.

166
00:17:59,504 --> 00:18:01,823
Stuart Jericho is landing now.

167
00:18:04,443 --> 00:18:07,879
BASE DE LA RFA LAKENHEATH SUFFOLK

168
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:08,756
- Billy is still breathing? - Artificially. The machine is ...

169
00:19:08,757 --> 00:19:10,591
keeping the body alive, but is dead

170
00:19:11,243 --> 00:19:15,596
You see those diodes? They give a micro load their frontal lobes.

171
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:19,233
Although the brain is clinically dead, charging active neurons ...

172
00:19:19,234 --> 00:19:22,770
one last time and allows us to see a map of your neural pattern.

173
00:19:22,938 --> 00:19:25,139
And then transfer it to the other's head?

174
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:29,193
No ... not a transfer. Jericho was chosen because Stuart has syndrome ...

175
00:19:29,194 --> 00:19:33,414
frontal lobe. A trauma to the brain as a child. Incredibly serious.

176
00:19:33,415 --> 00:19:37,852
One in 10 million His frontal lobe remains in an undeveloped state.

177
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:41,005
Plagued virgin neuronal cells. The stimulate with waves ...

178
00:19:41,006 --> 00:19:45,009
and duplicate the pattern. And did they do this work?

179
00:19:46,345 --> 00:19:49,814
The experiment rats walked through mazes they had never seen before.

180
00:19:50,115 --> 00:19:53,784
¿Rats? And what about human trials?

181
00:19:54,602 --> 00:19:55,853
He is watching.

182
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:28,803
What happened to that other guy?

183
00:20:38,213 --> 00:20:39,463
drilling begins.

184
00:20:56,581 --> 00:20:58,465
Subject receiver ready for insertion.

185
00:21:08,093 --> 00:21:10,160
Device ready for insertion.

186
00:21:20,105 --> 00:21:21,555
activated waves

187
00:21:27,062 --> 00:21:29,330
Started stimulation of neuronal cells.

188
00:21:36,638 --> 00:21:37,972
Testing procedure.

189
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:49,633
The temperature is increasing.

190
00:21:51,503 --> 00:21:54,805
We have a bleeding is at 102. 104.

191
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:57,183
Put him cold compresses before having an attack.

192
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:59,526
- What's going on? - We're losing him.

193
00:22:00,211 --> 00:22:02,329
We have to stop the bleeding or die.

194
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,798
Well, let's get the injector.

195
00:22:08,636 --> 00:22:13,641
Listen! Do not remove anything! Go Ahead!

196
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,143
You think I give a damn if he dies?

197
00:22:18,062 --> 00:22:19,313
Go Ahead!

198
00:22:27,772 --> 00:22:29,123
It is stabilizing.

199
00:22:57,218 --> 00:22:59,052
What do we tell his wife?

200
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:07,277
Nothing. For her, Billy died

201
00:23:07,278 --> 00:23:11,381
10 days ago. But that's not right.

202
00:23:13,501 --> 00:23:16,270
I can not say no miss Billy.

203
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:17,454
Like you.

204
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,908
Jericho! Jericho!

205
00:24:01,783 --> 00:24:06,803
Jericho. Jericho.

206
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:13,693
- Jericho, calm down all right. - My head.

207
00:24:13,694 --> 00:24:18,064
I gave an injection only when you take effect in a minute you will feel better.

208
00:24:18,616 --> 00:24:21,418
- You swear? - So is. You can trust me.

209
00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:24,738
- All right. Everyone out. - No no no. There is a protocol that ...

210
00:24:24,739 --> 00:24:27,140
No, you do not. You stay. Others.

211
00:24:34,899 --> 00:24:38,368
Hey, hey, look at me. Look at me. Do you know who I am?

212
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:43,273
I ... I have a headache I need some painkillers.

213
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:47,961
Yes, no, I love you give. But first I need you to remember.

214
00:24:48,563 --> 00:24:51,081
- Remember that? - What is your name?

215
00:24:53,234 --> 00:24:54,601
- My name? - Yes, your name.

216
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,737
Your name is Bill Pope.

217
00:25:00,241 --> 00:25:03,393
Why are you trying to confuse me boss? I'm sick.

218
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:04,978
Doctor, I need some kind of injection.

219
00:25:04,979 --> 00:25:06,730
- I need something. - I do not know what for.

220
00:25:07,031 --> 00:25:09,065
Do not look at him. He can not help you.

221
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:13,853
Only you can help Your name is Bill Pope.

222
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:16,239
You're an intelligence agent of the CIA.

223
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,741
What the hell is this?

224
00:25:19,644 --> 00:25:21,911
What the hell is going on? What I ...? What the hell is going on?

225
00:25:22,912 --> 00:25:24,230
- Pay attention. - What did you do to me?

226
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,232
- Pay ... Pay attention! - What did you do to me?

227
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:29,069
Remember Jan Strook The Dutch program.

228
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,771
- Someone related to Heimdhal - need. I need something.

229
00:25:37,011 --> 00:25:38,011
That's better.

230
00:25:38,863 --> 00:25:42,382
Then, a few days ago the Dutch dug ...

231
00:25:42,383 --> 00:25:45,301
a wormhole in the deep web.

232
00:25:45,302 --> 00:25:49,139
Do you want to stop and give me a moment with him? The man just had a procedure,

233
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,775
more cerebral and not tell you anything in that state.

234
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:56,246
Dutch suddenly becomes a whole control unit.

235
00:25:56,247 --> 00:25:58,932
You can fire a missile whenever, wherever.

236
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,838
But the issue goes beyond it, so the Dutch calls you you, Bill Pope.

237
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:07,490
Needed protection. He offered to make a deal ...

238
00:26:07,491 --> 00:26:08,808
I need something please.

239
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:10,126
Contigo, Bill Pope.

240
00:26:10,127 --> 00:26:13,413
I need something. Please. Aspirin, whatever.

241
00:26:13,714 --> 00:26:14,898
Chris, give him an aspirin.

242
00:26:15,716 --> 00:26:18,284
An aspirin will not help, but this will help.

243
00:26:21,972 --> 00:26:24,648
Bill, we had orders to kill the Dutch,

244
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:27,110
OK? But you ... you forced to cooperate

245
00:26:27,111 --> 00:26:30,997
because you thought you could trust him and that was remember?

246
00:26:30,998 --> 00:26:35,635
Billy, we did it your way. You took him to the shelter.

247
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:38,655
Do you remember anything? Billy!

248
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:44,911
Where do you put it? Where is the Dutch now?

249
00:26:44,995 --> 00:26:48,548
That's all we need to know! You go to your location, you picked ...

250
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:52,402
the money and walked back to close the deal. Remember!

251
00:26:53,003 --> 00:26:54,003
Remember!

252
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:02,845
I do not remember anything, asshole.

253
00:27:04,782 --> 00:27:07,984
You're confusing me with someone else.

254
00:27:13,107 --> 00:27:14,273
Try the family.

255
00:27:17,828 --> 00:27:21,497
The name of your daughter going. You remember, how do you call?

256
00:27:21,715 --> 00:27:24,667
Emma. Your wife, Jillian. Jill, right?

257
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,273
Come piece of junk. Remember something! Whatever!

258
00:27:31,592 --> 00:27:33,626
We have nothing at all. A bloody failure.

259
00:27:33,794 --> 00:27:35,962
The theory is fine. Rubbish the theory.

260
00:27:35,963 --> 00:27:39,582
Look at the damn theory! How long have you worked on this?

261
00:27:40,901 --> 00:27:45,321
- 18 years. - We want a refund.

262
00:27:46,907 --> 00:27:49,392
- Bring out the trash. - Yes sir.

263
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:55,264
JAN STROOK ALIAS "EL HOLANDES"

264
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:16,052
Well people, back to the beginning. We started from scratch.

265
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:18,654
- Hey, Charlie. Put the video of the Dutch. - Yes sir.

266
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,525
- That damn trash. - My name is Jan Strook.

267
00:28:23,544 --> 00:28:26,496
My alias is Dutch. I am now

268
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:29,448
Vigilant Shield sole administrator.

269
00:28:29,449 --> 00:28:32,752
Control System and Emergency Orders Army ...

270
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:37,039
the United States. I can authorize and activate any weapons system.

271
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:41,244
In its arsenal and cancel any current I can order.

272
00:28:41,979 --> 00:28:45,781
I will negotiate the wormhole again with you in exchange for ...

273
00:28:45,782 --> 00:28:50,386
asylum, permanent passports, security, protection, and 10 million dollars.

274
00:28:50,587 --> 00:28:51,587
Turn it off.

275
00:28:52,673 --> 00:28:57,209
Well people, let's look at this. Heimdhal and shelter here.

276
00:28:57,611 --> 00:29:01,681
The shop is here Somewhere between these the Dutch is, right?

277
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:07,570
Well Where? Hotels hostels. We'd know.

278
00:29:07,721 --> 00:29:10,690
Reviewed and homeless shelters. Where the hell is?

279
00:29:33,013 --> 00:29:34,663
You're not listening to me!

280
00:30:05,962 --> 00:30:09,031
- Hello. - Bill Pope please.

281
00:30:09,783 --> 00:30:15,554
- Who speaks? - An old friend Jan Strook.

282
00:30:16,172 --> 00:30:17,623
Do you find it?

283
00:30:18,892 --> 00:30:20,092
Billy this ...

284
00:30:23,797 --> 00:30:25,481
My husband is dead.

285
00:30:31,471 --> 00:30:34,674
Hello? Hi.

286
00:30:56,863 --> 00:30:58,281
Do I get a minute, friends?

287
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:09,423
Open the mouth. It is a vasodilator.

288
00:31:09,424 --> 00:31:11,143
It will increase blood circulation and ...

289
00:31:11,144 --> 00:31:13,245
reduce the pressure inside your head.

290
00:31:16,116 --> 00:31:20,219
Thank you Doctor. Would I freed now?

291
00:31:22,806 --> 00:31:27,042
- Beware. - Agree.

292
00:36:12,945 --> 00:36:15,229
- What? - All right.

293
00:36:27,609 --> 00:36:30,712
- One of those. I want that. - $ 4.20.

You're funny.

298
00:36:49,965 --> 00:36:51,332
Not worth it, buddy.

299
00:36:53,919 --> 00:36:55,086
Who is this guy?

300
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:05,930
- What happened to your face? - Here's one funny!

303
00:37:14,323 --> 00:37:16,874

I'm cold in the head.

00:44:35,629 --> 00:44:36,946
Yes, really?

00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:44,373
Changed the PIN.

319
00:44:46,074 --> 00:44:51,327
The PIN code. 6969. Yes things.

320
00:45:18,622 --> 00:45:20,390

00:45:50,154 --> 00:45:53,723
Emma must have given the button again guys. Sorry Luis.

323
00:46:19,249 --> 00:46:21,767
- It's okay. - Where were you? Who's there?

324
00:46:30,394 --> 00:46:32,161
Mom is here. Mom is here.

325
00:47:03,844 --> 00:47:06,722
Mi nombre es Jan. January Strook.

326
00:47:07,623 --> 00:47:10,600
Alias ​​"The Dutch". I'm the only one now ...

327
00:47:10,601 --> 00:47:14,154
Vigilant Shield administrator. The control system and orders ...

328
00:47:14,255 --> 00:47:16,873
Emergency for the United States Army.

329
00:47:18,325 --> 00:47:21,053
I brought, I made you my partner,

330
00:47:21,354 --> 00:47:25,681
I treated you as my son and you betrayed me.

331
00:47:26,266 --> 00:47:31,070
I am seeking cede control to an irresponsible group.

332
00:47:31,171 --> 00:47:35,124
Americans have annoyed me and now I want to kill.

333
00:47:35,275 --> 00:47:38,761
I will hunt you out and the heart, you know?

334
00:47:39,579 --> 00:47:42,965
The anarchist Heimdhal chasing me and ... I can not let ...

335
00:47:42,966 --> 00:47:46,619
I get that crazy bastard because I'm not crazy.

336
00:47:47,821 --> 00:47:50,274
Jan. Please come back.

337
00:47:51,475 --> 00:47:54,327
Come back home. To the house.

338
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:05,037
I asked for asylum in the Russian Federation and a permanent passport.

339
00:48:06,173 --> 00:48:08,504
I want a better deal, which is guarantees,

340
00:48:08,516 --> 00:48:10,443
protection and 10 million.

341
00:48:10,861 --> 00:48:13,679
It's not about the money, but my freedom.

342
00:48:14,614 --> 00:48:18,084
I will demonstrate my control over Vigilant Shield today at 6 PM.

343
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:23,372
9 HOURS TO WITHIN THE DUTCH

344
00:48:24,441 --> 00:48:25,708
Understood.

345
00:48:28,861 --> 00:48:32,765
We wait for the deadline. Let's see what the Dutch can do.

346
00:48:34,618 --> 00:48:38,370
Jillian called the police. They circulated a description of the intruder.

347
00:48:39,439 --> 00:48:43,042
Agrees with Jericho. He said he knew personal details.

348
00:48:43,393 --> 00:48:44,710
PIN number, the security code of the house.

349
00:48:44,711 --> 00:48:47,263
- It's a joke. - I talked to him.

350
00:48:48,064 --> 00:48:50,149
He recognized my voice. He knew my name.

351
00:48:53,753 --> 00:48:54,787
That's fucked up.

352
00:48:54,799 --> 00:48:57,473
The results returned from the lab.

353
00:48:57,474 --> 00:49:01,360
They confirmed that the two were officers in the vehicle.

354
00:49:01,895 --> 00:49:04,914
But the third passenger in the car is not Jericho.

355
00:49:08,735 --> 00:49:10,419
How are we going to find?

356
00:49:19,779 --> 00:49:23,232
- Here we go - You change trash for cash.

357
00:49:41,468 --> 00:49:43,902
Walk. I'm hungry.

358
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:06,147
Hi. One of those and vanilla with ...

359
00:50:06,159 --> 00:50:07,559
Good Morning. Francois.

360
00:50:07,752 --> 00:50:08,752
Good Morning.

361
00:50:16,553 --> 00:50:17,653
What did I just say?

362
00:50:26,546 --> 00:50:27,779
I am speaking spanish.

363
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,784
It is French ... bastard.

364
00:50:38,641 --> 00:50:39,961
I do not think we've met.

365
00:50:43,963 --> 00:50:46,798
Someone else? Someone else?

366
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:54,424
- Stop give class animal. - Someone else?

367
00:50:55,325 --> 00:50:57,868
You will end the day fucker talking more and better.

368
00:50:57,869 --> 00:50:59,069
I think you broke my nose.

369
00:50:59,662 --> 00:51:00,963
God, it hurts.

370
00:51:03,399 --> 00:51:05,701
- You're good? - I'm not well!

371
00:51:40,103 --> 00:51:41,103
Listen.

372
00:51:42,572 --> 00:51:45,424
Hear, you have a book of George Orwell here?

373
00:51:45,825 --> 00:51:50,212
- There's a queue, sir, if you do not mind. - That's right, and I'm the lips sweet face.

374
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,281
Maybe you can tell me where this type Orwell is.

375
00:51:58,454 --> 00:52:01,840
- Fourth floor, section 41. - Good. Fourth floor.

376
00:52:02,475 --> 00:52:05,894
- Fourth floor. - I am sorry.

377
00:52:36,142 --> 00:52:39,711
This is not OK. Where is the bag, Billy?

378
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:42,080
Where is the bag?

379
00:52:46,619 --> 00:52:47,619
God.

380
00:52:52,959 --> 00:52:54,643
Guys, I sign someone like Billy.

381
00:53:02,034 --> 00:53:04,619
- Must be Jericho. - Oh my God. Block him. Get it out.

382
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:09,090
- No no. Let it. I want to see you are looking for. - I can not get into the account.

383
00:53:09,091 --> 00:53:11,893
- We left out. - What is the access point?

384
00:53:12,494 --> 00:53:14,534
A computer at the public library in London.

385
00:53:27,643 --> 00:53:28,693
Is this.

386
00:53:32,982 --> 00:53:35,583
It seems that access our phone tracking program.

387
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,304
Dr. Franks.

388
00:53:42,942 --> 00:53:45,760
- Hello - is Quaker. Jericho is on its way ...

389
00:53:45,761 --> 00:53:49,314
toward you've got your location. Do not hang up, do you understand me?

390
00:53:50,098 --> 00:53:52,600
- Do not hang up. - I do understand.

391
00:54:05,181 --> 00:54:08,933
What's up, doc? I need more of these pills.

392
00:54:09,234 --> 00:54:12,253
Because one day does not remember being Bill Pope and squeezes me feel like ...

393
00:54:12,254 --> 00:54:14,472
head from within. You remember?

394
00:54:15,124 --> 00:54:18,343
What if I remember? It seems that I open the damn skull.

395
00:54:18,344 --> 00:54:20,895
And the same will happen to him unless he sees as help.

396
00:54:20,896 --> 00:54:23,882
- Yes of course Yes, yes. clear - Where?

397
00:54:25,901 --> 00:54:30,555
- Where? I'm not hearing anything. - The pharmacy down the street.

398
00:54:30,556 --> 00:54:31,556
Good.

399
00:54:33,576 --> 00:54:34,576
Come on.

400
00:54:49,875 --> 00:54:51,359
Hola. Dr. Franks.

401
00:54:54,647 --> 00:54:58,399
Hey hey. Hey, move your ass, damn it.

402
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:04,589
That was impolite Sorry. Do you hear that? I'm not sorry.

403
00:55:05,324 --> 00:55:08,860
That's Billy the speaker, not me. This guy is bugging me.

404
00:55:09,044 --> 00:55:11,763
Billy Pope's personality is affecting your behavior.

405
00:55:11,764 --> 00:55:14,916
And a damn know about Billy, I know nothing about that. All I know is that ...

406
00:55:14,917 --> 00:55:18,369
I'm living this. I can do things. It was you, okay?

407
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:20,662
You do not want to put things in my head, I try a mooring.

408
00:55:20,756 --> 00:55:23,891
- You have skills. - So is. I also do math.

409
00:55:23,892 --> 00:55:26,694
I speak languages. I go where I want, I do what I want.

410
00:55:27,046 --> 00:55:28,913
Everything is different. I am completely new.

411
00:55:29,031 --> 00:55:31,933
- Memories are chronological? - I dont know. They are triggered by things ...

412
00:55:31,934 --> 00:55:35,803
I say, I smell, use. Sometimes they come alone. Please, I just need one ...

413
00:55:35,804 --> 00:55:37,705
Well those pills. All right.

414
00:55:37,706 --> 00:55:39,123
All I need is ...

415
00:55:40,726 --> 00:55:44,162
- All I need is a pill. - Billy Pope remember things ...

416
00:55:44,163 --> 00:55:48,433
when in contact with things they shared. Places, touch, smells.

417
00:55:48,934 --> 00:55:50,868
- What about emotions? - If.

418
00:55:51,553 --> 00:55:53,571
- I met his wife and daughter. - Y...

419
00:55:54,274 --> 00:55:55,274
Y...

420
00:55:56,575 --> 00:56:00,061
- And there was, there was something. - What do you mean something?

421
00:56:00,512 --> 00:56:02,930
People always told me I did not feel anything ...

422
00:56:03,949 --> 00:56:09,253
this or that ... they speak. I can not ... I can not do this.

423
00:56:09,363 --> 00:56:10,363
Empújalo.

424
00:56:19,164 --> 00:56:23,534
- What about now? - Now you're confusing me.

425
00:56:23,952 --> 00:56:26,737
Or improving yourself. emotions are called.

426
00:56:29,107 --> 00:56:33,110
- Whatever they are, they are not useful to me - You do not get far in life without them.

427
00:56:36,698 --> 00:56:39,915
Yes, good. Thanks for the pills, doc.

428
00:56:39,927 --> 00:56:42,653
I need to ask you some tests ...

429
00:56:42,954 --> 00:56:45,056
before the process begins to fade.

430
00:56:46,575 --> 00:56:47,809
Disappear?

431
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:57,910
I'm not sure how much time you have.

432
00:56:58,611 --> 00:57:01,038
48 hours, do not know. Perhaps there is a ...

433
00:57:01,039 --> 00:57:04,642
way to make it last longer. Maybe I scored, doc. I have things to ...

434
00:57:04,643 --> 00:57:07,061
make money to find. Money?

435
00:57:07,462 --> 00:57:09,037
Yes. A huge bag full.

436
00:57:09,049 --> 00:57:11,482
What will you do with the money when you halles?

437
00:57:13,618 --> 00:57:17,063
I do not know. Maybe...

438
00:57:17,964 --> 00:57:20,508
you buy a house you know? Get me a TV.

439
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,694
A holiday like other people, right?

440
00:57:24,279 --> 00:57:25,279
Clear.

441
00:57:27,315 --> 00:57:29,366
- Cobra what I owe you. - Go through the house.

442
00:57:29,667 --> 00:57:30,667
Super.

443
00:57:32,387 --> 00:57:34,271
Super. Who the hell says "super"?

444
00:57:58,213 --> 00:58:03,434
Luis. Even you owe Billy 20 pounds of that bet. I guess it's just that ...

445
00:58:03,435 --> 00:58:06,153
- Me you pay me, right? - Mike, is fine.

446
00:58:09,741 --> 00:58:12,359
You remember everything, no? Where is the Dutch?

447
00:58:14,913 --> 00:58:18,382
I do not know But I remember that Mike had a bugged ankle.

448
00:58:47,445 --> 00:58:51,231
I do not know what their men do not know how they do, but have to stop beating him.

449
00:58:51,532 --> 00:58:54,968
- Especially in the head. - I understand ... I understand the point.

450
00:58:55,369 --> 00:58:58,155
But it comes on the way here. So who I'm dealing with?

451
00:58:58,156 --> 00:59:01,658
- Is Bill Pope? - No, Jericho. But it is influenced ...

452
00:59:01,659 --> 00:59:05,979
by memories, skills, routines Billy Pope.

453
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:06,673
¿Routines?

454
00:59:06,685 --> 00:59:08,799
If routines. Basically what we do ...

455
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:11,001
in life I is reduced to subconscious routines.

456
00:59:11,002 --> 00:59:15,072
It is these things that make the leap of Bill Pope to Jericho.

457
00:59:15,473 --> 00:59:18,959
He spoke of money, a bag is what drives it. Offer that money.

458
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,436
And he will give you what you want.

459
00:59:20,437 --> 00:59:22,513
Take it to the last place you had to Dutch.

460
00:59:22,514 --> 00:59:25,199
It triggered memories of Billy Pope and follow the trail.

461
00:59:25,483 --> 00:59:28,802
We hear from our sources The Dutch are trying to do ...

462
00:59:28,803 --> 00:59:32,523
a deal with the Russians. It will give evidence today at 6 PM.

463
00:59:33,641 --> 00:59:37,978
Did you hear that? We're screwed because you wanted a psychopath ...

464
00:59:37,979 --> 00:59:41,081
instead of a hero on our side.

465
00:59:47,972 --> 00:59:51,425
3 HOURS TO WITHIN THE DUTCH

466
01:00:13,948 --> 01:00:19,853
The ransom money in the bag ... We take up the Dutch and is yours.

467
01:00:22,941 --> 01:00:24,024
We have a deal?

468
01:00:27,512 --> 01:00:28,729
We have a deal?

469
01:00:36,471 --> 01:00:38,990
That. That.

470
01:00:41,391 --> 01:00:42,709
Yes, the beach.

471
01:00:44,245 --> 01:00:47,189
I want that too. I want to go there.

472
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:50,734
Well well. You can go to the beach.

473
01:00:51,185 --> 01:00:53,720
Now, do we have a deal?

474
01:01:04,916 --> 01:01:06,216
Do not shoot! Do not shoot!

475
01:01:08,736 --> 01:01:09,736
Put down your weapons!

476
01:01:12,389 --> 01:01:17,444
Only you can finish this The Dutch Where is it?

477
01:01:18,496 --> 01:01:22,082
- And the money is yours - Everything?

478
01:01:22,617 --> 01:01:25,218
- All. - And I want to go there.

479
01:01:26,404 --> 01:01:28,772
And the beach, yes.

480
01:01:48,793 --> 01:01:50,043
Where to Jericho?

481
01:02:01,522 --> 01:02:03,240
- Right. - Right.

482
01:02:20,141 --> 01:02:23,243
London City Airport

483
01:02:33,354 --> 01:02:36,394
Lord, the facial recognition system just detect a red alert.

484
01:02:37,124 --> 01:02:39,609
Pull over. Pull over!

485
01:02:47,017 --> 01:02:49,119
Put the convict waiting and send home.

486
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:50,970
- So no more? - The Dutchman has been sighted in ...

487
01:02:50,971 --> 01:02:54,924
City airport MI5 has. We're going over there.

488
01:02:56,343 --> 01:03:01,598
Hey hey! My money. Hey, what about my money?

489
01:04:04,912 --> 01:04:08,031
Elsa, it's yours now I need him alive.

490
01:04:11,201 --> 01:04:12,685
I'm afraid it's not your man.

491
01:04:32,539 --> 01:04:35,208
- I'm wound - Give me the gun.

492
01:04:47,004 --> 01:04:48,004
Do not kill him.

493
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:03,162
Lord ordain a team of divers to search the body of Jericho.

494
01:06:05,282 --> 01:06:10,169
That fucking disaster. We can not allow the Russians to make the deal.

495
01:06:11,355 --> 01:06:15,491
We will monitor its embassy. Anything that enters or leaves will be filtered, okay?

496
01:06:15,892 --> 01:06:17,693
- Yes sir. - That damn Heimdhal has been behind ...

497
01:06:17,694 --> 01:06:21,981
our from the beginning. I want new passwords.

498
01:06:22,482 --> 01:06:26,369
new firewall. Change. A military channels, Did you hear?

499
01:06:26,370 --> 01:06:27,470
Yes sir.

500
01:06:28,772 --> 01:06:32,992
1 HOUR TO WITHIN THE DUTCH

501
01:06:48,024 --> 01:06:51,076
I very much regret having lost Maybe if.

502
01:06:51,377 --> 01:06:53,979
"Yes Yes Yes Yes! If you had ...

503
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:56,882
followed closely the Dutch ...

504
01:06:56,883 --> 01:06:59,403
maybe we would have the wormhole!

505
01:07:03,304 --> 01:07:04,323
I must say I'm not ...

506
01:07:04,324 --> 01:07:09,161
- Very happy moment, Elsa. - You want me to leave?

507
01:07:09,162 --> 01:07:10,229
No.

508
01:07:16,119 --> 01:07:20,172
- I apologize. - All right.

509
01:07:28,865 --> 01:07:30,950
We need to find Jericho.

510
01:08:23,069 --> 01:08:25,471
- Mom can watch TV? - Of course dear.

511
01:09:24,347 --> 01:09:30,218
What are you doing in my basement? What is all this?

512
01:09:32,855 --> 01:09:34,289
That belongs to Emma.

513
01:09:37,877 --> 01:09:43,398
- Did you work with Billy? - I do not think ... someone like him ...

514
01:09:43,399 --> 01:09:45,568
never work with someone like me.

515
01:09:47,269 --> 01:09:50,138
They put Billy in my mind.

516
01:09:51,424 --> 01:09:52,976
I have a scar, do you see?

517
01:09:54,677 --> 01:09:57,529
Everything the wise. All I could do ...

518
01:09:57,530 --> 01:10:02,784
I have it mixed inside me. That's impossible.

519
01:10:05,004 --> 01:10:08,890
The first car was a two bought Rover, used.

520
01:10:09,542 --> 01:10:13,195
Smelled of fish and chips. The clutch broke the first week.

521
01:10:15,231 --> 01:10:17,599
Of course I did not have the $ 100 to fix it.

522
01:10:18,901 --> 01:10:22,054
I told you. They put their brain into me.

523
01:10:22,305 --> 01:10:25,307
- Stop. - Mom! Mom, where are you?

524
01:10:25,308 --> 01:10:28,059
- I'm hungry - Just a moment, linda

525
01:10:31,297 --> 01:10:35,066
Sunday night. Chicken and Waffles.

526
01:10:36,519 --> 01:10:41,690
Your doing the chicken, the Waffles. I know she likes the syrup ...

527
01:10:41,691 --> 01:10:43,111
only in the bottom.

528
01:10:47,112 --> 01:10:49,331
I fragments arrive. Things going.

529
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:54,411
Different places. I see things.

530
01:10:55,812 --> 01:10:57,422
Do not ask me how they did it but ...

531
01:10:59,675 --> 01:11:01,893
- They did it. - Why?

532
01:11:05,314 --> 01:11:09,467
They are seeking details of a place where your husband hid a guy before he was killed.

533
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:17,859
Daughter comes to feed you end up here Yo ...

534
01:11:26,335 --> 01:11:30,505
I'll finish here and go. I will leave you alone.

535
01:11:44,570 --> 01:11:47,589
Billy never could have hurt and I could not.

536
01:12:47,983 --> 01:12:50,502
OUTSIDE THE COAST OF PORTUGAL

537
01:13:23,335 --> 01:13:26,854
- Armed missile to port, sir. - That is not possible.

538
01:13:26,855 --> 01:13:29,057
Guidance systems are down. The monitoring well.

539
01:13:29,058 --> 01:13:33,611
- Turn it off. - I can not. We are blocked Mr.

540
01:13:41,470 --> 01:13:43,805
Missile fired. Again, missile fired.

541
01:13:48,994 --> 01:13:51,714
Send self-destruct code before it reaches its target.

542
01:13:56,919 --> 01:13:58,319
Negative, does not respond.

543
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:17,205
We're safe. No material remained're fine.

544
01:14:20,409 --> 01:14:23,628
- Oh my God. - We do not fired that missile, sir.

545
01:14:42,798 --> 01:14:44,382
Did you know I lost my dad?

546
01:14:49,755 --> 01:14:52,299
Elly gave me for my birthday.

547
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:57,044
The deeper stronger will.

548
01:14:58,013 --> 01:14:59,330
Do deep.

549
01:15:04,152 --> 01:15:05,703
You got hurt?

550
01:15:15,213 --> 01:15:20,952
- Behind. Emma, ​​come here, please. - No. Mom, we're burying Elly.

551
01:15:20,953 --> 01:15:25,773
- Come here. - He said he was a friend of Dad.

552
01:15:27,743 --> 01:15:33,514
- Go away please. - Can you stay for dinner? He is friendly.

553
01:15:34,633 --> 01:15:36,000
Emma, ​​come in.

554
01:15:45,010 --> 01:15:46,761
Will the Waffles and leave.

555
01:16:06,581 --> 01:16:08,732
- Come and touch. - What?

556
01:16:09,301 --> 01:16:10,484
Come and play.

557
01:16:13,655 --> 01:16:15,906
- I do not know how. - I teach you.

558
01:16:20,812 --> 01:16:24,114
- I do not know if it's a good idea. - It's okay. Come.

559
01:16:28,737 --> 01:16:29,770
Friend.

560
01:16:35,994 --> 01:16:37,747
Just put your hands well.

561
01:16:40,148 --> 01:16:42,900
Put your hand there and touch.

562
01:16:50,175 --> 01:16:51,175
It's okay.

563
01:17:04,589 --> 01:17:06,156
It's okay. Do it again.

564
01:17:11,112 --> 01:17:15,182
All right. Emma. It's late. It's time to go to bed.

565
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:21,288
Yes mom. Good night, Jericho. Good night mom.

566
01:17:21,623 --> 01:17:22,639
Good night, honey.

567
01:17:36,187 --> 01:17:37,421
Who you are?

568
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:47,047
I do not know Most of my life a number.

569
01:17:49,601 --> 01:17:55,089
My brain does not always work well. I have not always done well.

570
01:17:57,225 --> 01:17:59,477
Having your husband in my head made me ...

571
01:18:01,278 --> 01:18:03,730
It made me feel things. Knowing things.

572
01:18:05,583 --> 01:18:10,928
Good bad. I guess it does not matter.

573
01:18:10,929 --> 01:18:13,073
The doctor says it will soon disappear.

574
01:18:15,994 --> 01:18:17,728
Can you tell me what Billy felt?

575
01:18:21,933 --> 01:18:22,933
Can?

576
01:18:27,539 --> 01:18:29,957
There was something funny that Billy used to do.

577
01:18:41,953 --> 01:18:44,504
That was his sign to say he loved me.

578
01:18:47,025 --> 01:18:51,921
I know. HE...

579
01:18:53,322 --> 01:18:56,817
I know what that love should mean, but I ...

580
01:18:59,370 --> 01:19:04,024
never. The day of our wedding. You remember?

581
01:19:06,728 --> 01:19:12,649
- If the beach. - The first time you gave to Emma.

582
01:19:13,651 --> 01:19:15,252
Was so happy.

583
01:19:21,092 --> 01:19:24,378
I am sorry. I am sorry.

584
01:19:31,352 --> 01:19:35,672
He love you ... so much.

585
01:19:43,531 --> 01:19:44,859
Where to go now?

586
01:19:47,660 --> 01:19:51,788
I dont know. Where ... I take it.

587
01:19:53,841 --> 01:19:57,711
Then stay here. You can stay on the couch.

588
01:20:05,203 --> 01:20:07,304
It would not be the first time on that couch.

589
01:20:14,812 --> 01:20:17,714
Most importantly our history. A mysterious missile was launched from the ...

590
01:20:17,715 --> 01:20:22,085
coast of Portugal. The question is: Where did this missile?

591
01:20:29,610 --> 01:20:32,746
Good Morning. I brought you some fresh coffee.

592
01:20:33,581 --> 01:20:34,581
Thank you.

593
01:20:39,804 --> 01:20:42,923
Do not worry. It's okay.

594
01:20:44,809 --> 01:20:48,511
Where did this missile, we will not know who will be held responsible.

595
01:21:00,324 --> 01:21:04,210
You're working at the university. There is a cage where there are books, right?

596
01:21:04,412 --> 01:21:07,614
- A bookcase with a wrench. - Yes, the collection of rare books.

597
01:21:07,782 --> 01:21:10,633
Billy and I used to go there sometimes. Why? Does this have something to do with ...

598
01:21:10,634 --> 01:21:12,035
Yes Yes.

599
01:21:14,021 --> 01:21:16,740
All. I need a car.

600
01:21:17,124 --> 01:21:19,876
- And the key for books. - Sure Ten.

601
01:21:25,766 --> 01:21:28,918
We'll have money, Jil. A lot.

602
01:21:38,129 --> 01:21:40,230
I wish I could remain it.

603
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:06,339
- Emma. up please. - All right.

604
01:22:08,309 --> 01:22:11,845
Come. You must take a shower. Did you close the door down?

605
01:22:12,043 --> 01:22:13,043
Yes.

606
01:22:27,144 --> 01:22:28,828
Where is Jericho?

607
01:23:20,247 --> 01:23:23,433
Yes. Georgie Orwell.

608
01:23:53,931 --> 01:23:57,900
- You're the guy I killed myself. - Good memory.

609
01:24:04,241 --> 01:24:09,478
- If you hurt me, I'll do worse. - Respect your creed.

610
01:24:21,475 --> 01:24:22,475
Over there.

611
01:24:42,145 --> 01:24:46,499
Lord, I have something. Aku Madhav, Russian FSB operative.

612
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:49,769
What makes arriving in a fishing boat in Dagana?

613
01:24:50,504 --> 01:24:53,739
It seems that is not stupid enough to try it alone from the embassy.

614
01:24:54,441 --> 01:24:56,892
They are going to bring a team to pick up the Dutch!

615
01:24:57,210 --> 01:24:58,678
Put me in the air, now!

616
01:25:14,361 --> 01:25:17,713
Keep in 1-11. They're heading right toward us.

617
01:25:18,482 --> 01:25:21,450
We will continue to the Russians. They take us to the Dutch.

618
01:25:25,972 --> 01:25:30,209
I do not particularly like children. Never meet expectations.

619
01:25:30,210 --> 01:25:33,212
- Jericho! JERICHO! please help! - Enters.

620
01:25:34,030 --> 01:25:36,382
Do not! High! Please!

621
01:25:37,968 --> 01:25:40,970
High. No more violence.

622
01:25:40,971 --> 01:25:43,973
No more violence. I Lift him.

623
01:25:47,127 --> 01:25:48,844
Take me to the Dutch.

624
01:25:52,899 --> 01:25:54,483
This in there.

625
01:26:05,995 --> 01:26:07,329
Show me the thermal scanners.

626
01:26:15,188 --> 01:26:19,608
Russian rescue team is on the truck. The follow not come.

627
01:26:21,177 --> 01:26:25,064
All units, we are stealthy surveillance. not approximate.

628
01:26:25,715 --> 01:26:26,715
It is understood.

629
01:26:35,992 --> 01:26:40,879
There. In college. No closer until we see the Dutch.

630
01:26:40,981 --> 01:26:42,581
All units, not approximate.

631
01:26:53,476 --> 01:26:55,094
Come. Come on.

632
01:27:03,553 --> 01:27:05,387
Team sniper, what is your position?

633
01:27:05,922 --> 01:27:07,442
Moving sniper team.

634
01:27:22,805 --> 01:27:26,608
- Lord, we see Heimdhal and Jericho - Proceed! Proceed!

635
01:27:26,609 --> 01:27:29,228
- All units, come. - Disable the Russian team.

636
01:27:29,479 --> 01:27:30,963
We need to Jericho alive.

637
01:27:44,344 --> 01:27:46,128
Your wife and daughter just died.

638
01:27:52,936 --> 01:27:54,620
Lands this thing!

639
01:27:56,189 --> 01:27:58,824
- No, he's not there. They do not. - What do you mean?

640
01:27:59,025 --> 01:28:02,811
I just say do not. I just said. Tell you the madman.

641
01:28:02,812 --> 01:28:05,764
It's up there, okay? It is not there. They dont have it.

642

I will go. Go to the airfield. You have to get out of here.

643

Shut up. You do not know me but I know you.

649
01:29:49,135 --> 01:29:53,838
You and Pope made a deal. He's dead, but he is honoring.

650
01:29:56,576 --> 01:29:59,978
Your money. Your passport.

Do exactly what you say and maybe live to spend all this money.

655
01:30:39,502 --> 01:30:41,269
You're a fucking genius.

656
01:30:44,590 --> 01:30:50,278
This thing here is all crazy. Live and die for the same cause.

657
01:30:50,730 --> 01:30:51,830
Bright.

658
01:30:54,517 --> 01:30:55,517

01:32:01,239 --> 01:32:06,343
You need an ambulance sir. If you wait around here I will send a paramedic.

669
01:32:07,745 --> 01:32:08,745
Good.

670
01:32:26,264 --> 01:32:27,797
Who is that?

671
01:32:41,412 --> 01:32:42,412
She's dead.

672
01:32:47,518 --> 01:32:49,653
Yes. With all.

673
01:32:50,554 --> 01:32:52,589
Take the computer. Make her look.

674
01:32:52,590 --> 01:32:55,125
An ambulance stolen right outside. A wounded man robbery.

675
01:32:55,126 --> 01:32:57,560
- It fits the description of Jericho. - Is Jericho who has it.

676
01:32:57,561 --> 01:32:59,801
- We're on our way. - To whom to get me their position.

677
01:33:06,337 --> 01:33:09,339
- Elsa? - Do I look like I sound like Elsa cursed?

678
01:33:09,340 --> 01:33:12,792
- Where is it? - I fell sticks. She's dead. The devil ...

679
01:33:12,793 --> 01:33:15,779

680
01:33:15,780 --> 01:33:19,849
- You're dictating terms to me? - So is. crazy.

681
01:33:20,867 --> 01:33:23,979

You'll come here and deliver me drive ...

683
01:33:28,592 --> 01:33:33,580
They say something or they die. Jericho. help. I have. Do something.

684
01:33:33,581 --> 01:33:36,049
- Hello. - She will be the first to die ...

685
01:33:36,050 --> 01:33:38,751

686
01:33:39,353 --> 01:33:42,522
I'll finish. I'll finish.

687
01:33:57,304 --> 01:33:59,381
Jericho! Jericho!

688
01:34:00,682 --> 01:34:03,459
Do not deliver the unit, you understand me?

689
01:34:03,594 --> 01:34:08,898
- He will put earth, do you get me? - I know how to do this.

690
01:34:08,899 --> 01:34:13,570
Jericho. You do not know how to do anything. You will only fly you head.

691
01:34:13,704 --> 01:34:16,890
- You're not Bill Pope! - The threat with a jerk weapon.

692
01:34:17,691 --> 01:34:22,502
Threatens ... the girl what's her name?

693
01:34:22,903 --> 01:34:23,913
I can not remember his name.

694
01:34:23,914 --> 01:34:27,967
- Emma. It's called Emma. - Connect us to the ambulance radio.

695
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:31,587
- It is done. You can listen to. - Jericho is Dr. Franks.

696
01:34:31,588 --> 01:34:35,658
I think I can freeze what is left of the implant, Jericho. You can be normal.

697
01:34:35,659 --> 01:34:39,478
But we must do it now before it's gone. Turn around, go back,

698
01:34:39,479 --> 01:34:40,713
and find me.

699
01:34:43,150 --> 01:34:45,535
- And what about Jillian. - It's just someone else at risk.

700
01:34:45,536 --> 01:34:49,372
Jericho. We are all gonna die. Leave them do not matter!

701
01:34:50,641 --> 01:34:52,058
It does to me!

702
01:35:42,176 --> 01:35:43,209
A lesson.

703
01:36:00,761 --> 01:36:02,562

It is approaching so get ready.

707
01:37:01,855 --> 01:37:03,172
¡Jericho!

708
01:37:20,994 --> 01:37:22,111
He's got Emma!

709
01:37:32,489 --> 01:37:33,489
Toss it.

710
01:37:36,677 --> 01:37:37,760
Chuck it!

711
01:37:50,791 --> 01:37:51,958
Give me the unit.

712
01:38:09,075 --> 01:38:10,075
Emma runs.

713
01:38:44,110 --> 01:38:46,038
What are the coordinates down there?

714
01:38:46,639 --> 01:38:50,766
I have a little souvenir for them.

715
01:39:19,529 --> 01:39:20,696
- Quake. - I receive.

716
01:39:20,697 --> 01:39:24,700
Heimdhal just launched one of our cruise missiles 96km north yours.

717
01:39:25,001 --> 01:39:27,786
Evacuate the area. Come out of there.

718
01:39:29,789 --> 01:39:33,492
Hears. Do you have any idea what you've done?

719
01:39:33,893 --> 01:39:36,712
We've killed them all, damn fool!

720
01:39:36,713 --> 01:39:39,648
Hears. Why do not you fired, by God?

721
01:39:42,335 --> 01:39:45,621
Do not worry much. I did...

722
01:39:47,222 --> 01:39:48,607
I had this guy fix.

723
01:39:48,691 --> 01:39:50,542
- Who? - I do not remember his name.

724
01:39:50,727 --> 01:39:51,794
- Jan Strip. - No.

725
01:39:51,795 --> 01:39:56,031
- Dutch. The Dutch - Yes Yes Dutch..

726
01:39:56,182 --> 01:39:57,950
- On the settlement. - Do I Fix what?

727
01:39:58,084 --> 01:40:00,002
¡Jericho!

728
01:40:00,670 --> 01:40:03,188
Jericho, which managed the Dutch?

729
01:40:04,824 --> 01:40:06,443
The first shot Heimdhal ...

730
01:40:10,644 --> 01:40:11,663
He is to be.

731
01:40:13,116 --> 01:40:17,002
A where he tried to send it back into position.

732
01:40:20,323 --> 01:40:21,667
I told that son of a bitch.

733
01:40:23,468 --> 01:40:26,612
If you hurt me, I'll do worse.

734
01:40:27,513 --> 01:40:28,513
I screwed up.

735
01:40:52,171 --> 01:40:54,089
I'm cold in the head.

736
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:01,697
I'm cold.

737
01:41:49,145 --> 01:41:52,314
- Are you sure of this? - There has been responding.

738
01:41:53,266 --> 01:41:54,885
Perhaps this do something.

739
01:41:56,086 --> 01:41:59,504
If he remembers something, whatever, Bill Pope remain.

740
01:42:39,912 --> 01:42:43,715
You may not remember me, but I know you.

741
01:43:36,085 --> 01:43:38,487
Is incredible. He remembers.

742
01:43:40,288 --> 01:43:42,090
What will free now? What shall let?
