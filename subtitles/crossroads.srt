{8698}{8750}Course you did.
{8794}{8850}Why didn't it feel|like anything?.
{8853}{8937}What do you mean, you didn't|feel anything?. It felt great!

{9197}{9285}And like all the parties|at Hemmings Field and stuff...
{9287}{9354}I never went to any of'em.
{9356}{9476}I never stayed out late.|I never just hung out.

{14796}{14829}Why are you stopping?.
{14869}{14920}This isn't how I hoped it would be.
{14922}{14999}That's weird, 'cause this is|exactly how I hoped it would be...
{15001}{15061}or pretty accurate.
{15063}{15181}- Maybe ifwe get into bed.|- That's a good idea.

{42925}{42993}Look at all that smoke.
{43302}{43356}What's wrong with it, Ben?.
{43358}{43434}It's the head gasket, I think.
{43437}{43502}- Give me your shirt.|- Here.
{43550}{43601}Whoa! What are you doing?.
{43604}{43659}Nobody touches this except|for specialists and myself.

{44870}{44962}We don't have $350.|Even if he gets a tow truck...
{44964}{45016}we don't have enough money|to get the car fixed.
{45018}{45137}I'm gonna be stuck here in--|Where the hell am I?. Where am I?.

{45384}{45429}Whatever.

{45475}{45524}Could you be more self-centered?.
{45597}{45676}- You're just jealous.|- What?.
{45678}{45785}I'm not blind. I know how girls|like you looked at me in school.

{62008}{62095}She has!|Give us the details!
{62098}{62182}It's always the quiet ones.
{62185}{62248}Say it loud. Say you|touched one and you're proud!
{62251}{62318}Lucy touched one!|She did!
{62555}{62630}Okay, the best thing|that ever happened to you.
{62633}{62683}- That's easy.|- What?.
{62715}{62783}Reaching my goal weight.
{62786}{62870}Third year at fat camp,|the summer before eighth grade.
{62873}{62954}Wait, that camp you went to|every summer was a fat camp?.
{63044}{63104}Yes, and I loved it.
{63104}{63105}Yes, and I loved it.
{63107}{63159}For two months...
{63162}{63256}my mama wasn't around|to pick on me for being fat.
{63288}{63366}Being fat is just|unacceptable to her.
{63412}{63506}Okay. The worst thing|that ever happened to you.
{63508}{63569}That's even easier.|Reaching my goal weight.
{63572}{63613}- You said--|- It turns out...
{63616}{63700}that being prettier|than my mama...
{63703}{63763}is even more|unacceptable.
{63793}{63831}Oh,Jesus.
{63869}{63915}Yep.
{63917}{64016}One morning I woke up,|and she was gone.
{64019}{64090}Pop really wouldn't|say anything about it.
{64092}{64187}I thought she was coming back,|and Pop told me she wasn't.
{64212}{64277}They fought all the time.
{64280}{64360}You know, I think|that she just got fed up...
{64362}{64427}and took off|without even thinking.
{64430}{64524}And after a while, it was|just too late to come back.
{64568}{64629}I know she wants to see me.
{64687}{64746}She's just scared, that's all.
{64792}{64872}I'm gonna be so sick later.
{64875}{64952}Mimi, be glad you're pregnant|and you couldn't act stupid with us.
{64955}{65066}That's not why I don't drink.|I just don't see the point in it.
{65068}{65109}So you never partied?.
{65172}{65217}Once.
{65269}{65307}Over Christmas.
{65339}{65422}There was one of those parties|at Hemmings Field.
{65468}{65526}And this guy|was drinking this beer...
{65528}{65644}and I remember|it was in a blue bottle.
{65647}{65741}And I was real mad|at Kurt because...
{65744}{65831}he blew me off again|to hang out with his friends.
{65871}{65934}So I had a few beers.
{65978}{66033}I had more than a few.
{66078}{66175}This guy, you know, he seemed--|He seemed real nice...
{66178}{66251}'cause when I couldn't walk,|he offered to drive me home.
{66369}{66443}It's no big deal, Luce.|It happens to girls all the time.
{66446}{66505}Did you go to the police?.
{66508}{66559}No.
{66562}{66645}I'm from a trailer park.|I got drunk and got in his car.
{66648}{66720}So, Kurt's not the father?.
{66751}{66815}I saw this ad in a magazine.
{66818}{66955}So I called up this lawyer in|Atlanta, and she sent me this stuff.
{66957}{67013}Um, all these pictures|and letters...
{67016}{67089}of all these people|who want babies.
{67092}{67150}- I was supposed to pick one.|- The guy...
{67208}{67260}what was his name?.
{67312}{67360}I don't know.

{67508}{67576}I don't know.|People drift apart.
{67579}{67668}Promise me we won't|drift apart again.

{69692}{69761}- Yeah, get his keys.|- Why do I have to get his keys?.

{69912}{69975}Yeah, Lucy, get his keys.
{70156}{70263}- This is stealing.|- It's not stealing if he's in the car.

{74652}{74733}Mimi, you said|he didn't kill anyone.
{74736}{74836}- I said I thought he didn't.|- Oh, my God.
{74942}{75012}- It's okay, I'll go.|- I'm sorry.
{75105}{75151}God!
{75153}{75220}Be careful, Lucy.
{75361}{75447}- We're sorry.|- I've been in a car full of chicks.
{75450}{75526}Do you have any idea what it's like|being surrounded by girls?.
{75588}{75662}Being a girl yourself,|I know, stupid question.
{75664}{75752}But I'm a guy, okay?.|I'm a guy.Just a guy.
{75755}{75859}And I have been listening|to girl talk and watching you do...
{75861}{75919}your girl things for days.
{75921}{75988}I'm not complaining, 'cause,|let's face it, I'm outnumbered.
{75990}{76036}But that's my car.
{76038}{76109}It's my car, and it's just--
{76216}{76273}It's the one thing that hasn't|been taken over by chicks.
{76315}{76402}- Okay?.|- Okay.
{77145}{77223}- Ben?.|- Yeah?.
{77225}{77278}Were you really in jail?.
{77335}{77382}Yeah, I was.
{77384}{77438}- So you killed a guy?.|- What?.
{77467}{77517}Who said I killed a guy?.
{77545}{77620}Everybody back home.
{77623}{77736}Oh, man.|No, I didn't kill a guy.
{77738}{77800}What did you do then?.
{77803}{77935}I was in college, and I get|this call from my stepsister.
{77937}{78053}She wants me to come get her 'cause|my stepdad is beating her up.
{78056}{78106}My mom can't stop him, so...
{78108}{78195}I drive home in|the middle of the night...
{78197}{78281}and she throws her things out|the window and climbs out...
{78284}{78329}and then I drive her back|to school in Ohio with me.
{78332}{78415}- And you went to jail for that?.|- That's the thing.
{78418}{78462}There's this law...
{78464}{78549}against driving a child that's|not a relative across state lines...
{78552}{78616}and my stepdad of course|pressed charges.
{78618}{78686}But, you know, it's okay.|I only got six months...
{78688}{78742}and I had to stay in Ohio|for a year's probation.
{78744}{78827}My sister got to go live|with her mom.
{78969}{79028}You all really thought|I killed a guy?.
{79056}{79101}Yeah.
{79156}{79249}What were you thinking getting|into a car with a homicidal maniac?.
{79659}{79742}- Why are we stopping?.|- You'll see.
{80021}{80097}- Mimi, you okay?.|- Oh, yeah, I'm fine.
{80204}{80251}Look.
{80360}{80415}It's like you have to whisper.
{80457}{80503}Hello!
{80732}{80815}Man. We gotta make time. The next|hotel is still an hour away.
{80818}{80908}Ben, do you have enough|sleeping bags for all of us?.
{80926}{80959}You serious?.
{80961}{81024}You really want to camp here?.
{81027}{81058}Yeah.
{81108}{81159}It sounds like fun.
{81220}{81304}You gotta keep your thumb|on the outside like this.
{81340}{81395}Right. Now, the trick is...
{81397}{81480}you don't want to let him know|that you're gonna hit him.
{81483}{81568}Maybe like look away first.
{81571}{81672}And then, when he least expects it,|you throw your whole body into it.
{81786}{81832}What are you doing to her?.
{81834}{81880}I'm teaching her how to fight|because every girl...
{81882}{81951}should know how|to throw a decent punch.
{81953}{81987}That was decent.
{81989}{82036}I'm gonna go to bed.
{82038}{82106}I'm gonna go to the ladies room.|Where is it again?.
{82108}{82178}Third bush after the rock|over there.
{82180}{82237}- This one?.|- That one, yeah.
{82358}{82406}What are you always|writing in there?.
{82443}{82510}Poems, mostly.
{82512}{82573}Can I hear one?.
{82606}{82696}Okay. One.|But you can't laugh.
{82824}{82887}"I used to think I had|the answers to everything...
{82890}{82948}but now I know that life|doesn't always go my way.
{82950}{83043}It feels like I'm caught in the|middle, and that's when I realize...
{83045}{83127}that I'm not a girl,|and not yet a woman.
{83129}{83220}All I need is time,|just a moment that's mine.
{83222}{83301}And while I'm in between,|I'm not a girl."
{83408}{83441}I liked it.
{83444}{83482}Really?.
{83484}{83535}Yeah, really, I like it.
{83648}{83728}- What?.|- You got ash on your face.
{83730}{83779}- Where?.|- I'll get it.
{83781}{83827}There.
{84041}{84082}- What's wrong?.|- What happened?.
{84084}{84139}Something bit my ass.
{84141}{84213}- Let me see.|- It's a snake bite.
{84216}{84261}No, Mimi,|that's a mosquito bite.
{84312}{84357}Don't look!
{84360}{84441}- How could I not?. It's nothing.|- But it could've been a snake.
{84444}{84509}All right! We are outta here|at the crack of dawn.
{84512}{84573}Nothing's biting my ass.
{84639}{84691}So we'll be in Tucson today?.
{84693}{84762}- Around 4:00, I think.|- Are you nervous?.
{84764}{84856}Should I call and tell her I'm|coming, or should I just show up?.
{84859}{84931}- I should just show up, right?.|- Surprise is always better.
{84933}{85009}She's gonna be|real happy to see you.
{85012}{85048}I hope so.
{85381}{85464}You'll call and tell me everything|about the audition, right?.
{85466}{85568}-You could still come with us.|-We don't leave town until tomorrow.
{85570}{85621}I'll be fine, okay?.

{91912}{91975}What happened?.
{92123}{92169}She said...
{92207}{92252}that she never wanted me.
{92370}{92496}She said that my father|made her have me...
{92532}{92606}and that I was|just a mistake.
{93063}{93132}I look like her, you know?.
{93165}{93254}I have her eyes and her hands.
{93256}{93310}It's her loss, Luce.
{93335}{93393}It's weird though, you know?.
{93435}{93481}I don't have a mother.
{93483}{93525}Well, you have us.
{93527}{93569}Yeah.
{94000}{94054}Trying to call your dad?.

{94616}{94648}Okay.
{94763}{94832}This is my surprise?.
{94835}{94885}Wouldn't it be sad if it was?.
{94887}{94949}Like if I just totally sucked|at cheering people up.
{95014}{95082}I wrote some music|foryour poem.
{95143}{95191}Will you play it for me?.
{95194}{95239}Will you sing?.

{95760}{95802}- Yeah.|- Like that?.
{96288}{96376}Go my way|Like that?.
{96429}{96526}It feels like I'm caught|in the middle
{96529}{96574}A little low there.
{96577}{96685}That's when I realize
{96688}{96770}I'm not a girl
{96837}{96908}And not yet a woman
{96997}{97074}All I need is time
{97077}{97156}A moment that is mine

{113387}{113466}Like it was my keys|or something.
{113522}{113605}Isn't that the stupidest|damn thing you've ever heard?.
{113709}{113759}I'd decided to keep her.
{113827}{113897}I was standing on the beach...
{113899}{114017}and my toes were|in the Pacific Ocean...
{114074}{114120}and she kicked.
{114183}{114232}It was like this sign.
{114268}{114317}Don't touch me, Luce.|I'm already crying.
{114320}{114373}Okay.
{114426}{114477}I would have made a good mom.

{114818}{114864}Lucy, I'm waiting|for an answer.
{114866}{114928}Do you know what it took|to come here?.
{114930}{115010}I had to take cash out of savings|for plane fare and hotel.
{115012}{115097}I worked hard to earn that money|for your college education.
{115099}{115132}I'm sorry.
{115262}{115361}So you made a mistake.|I understand.
{115363}{115499}Everybody makes mistakes.|You're forgiven.
{115502}{115558}I'm gonna take you girls back|to where you belong...
{115561}{115626}and we'll forget about|this whole crazy thing, all right?.
{115629}{115674}Okay.
{115677}{115723}Who's that boy you were with?.
{115726}{115805}How old is he anyway?. Is he the one|who put the crazy idea in your head?.
{115888}{115945}He just gave us a ride.
{115947}{116001}That's all.
{116145}{116209}Hey, sorry it took me so long.|We got a band.
{116212}{116320}- What are you doing?.|- Packing.
{116322}{116432}My father says I have|to move to his hotel, so--
{116434}{116527}Until the audition?.|How are we gonna rehearse?.
{116529}{116584}I'm not going to the audition.
{116669}{116781}Look, I have to|go back with him, okay?.
{116861}{116914}Ben, he's my father, okay?.
