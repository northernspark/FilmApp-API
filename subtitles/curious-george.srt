Well, now that that's done, you can
finally finish what you've started...

Look out. Here comes
the Bloomsberry Express!

Yes! Yes! Next stop
archeological fame and fortune!

142

I'm going to discover

Can I have the Bloomsberry Express
pull into the reality station...

147
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:27,696
and sign here, initial here.
Nope, not there.

148
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,758
Wait! I guess I could go.

149
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,929
Did I just say that?
I can't do that.

150
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,565
I don't even ride the bus.
Maybe they didn't hear me.

151
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,233
I'm sorry, sir.
You were saying?

152
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,902
Excellent idea, Ted.

153
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,502
He did hear me.

154
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:45,074
Him? You've got to be kidding
me. Ted is not an explorer.

1242
01:14:59,995 --> 01:15:02,156
There you are, 17-B.

1243
01:15:02,231 --> 01:15:04,392
Boy, you're light
on your feet for a big man.

1244
01:15:04,466 --> 01:15:08,402
I must admit, your monkey
shows real talent.

1245
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:09,528
Quite the artist.

1246
01:15:09,605 --> 01:15:12,073
So I am taking back
kickinging you from building.

1247
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:14,973
Oh, that's great, Ivan.
No hard feelings.

1248
01:15:15,444 --> 01:15:17,969
Oh, Georgie,
you're just so cute.

1249
01:15:18,981 --> 01:15:20,175
I think he likes me.

1250
01:15:20,315 --> 01:15:22,010
Right over there.
Thanks, Mr. Bloomsberry.

1251
01:15:22,084 --> 01:15:25,144
I parked all the cars, Father.
Good job, Son.

1252
01:15:25,754 --> 01:15:27,847
Really? A good job.

1253
01:15:28,257 --> 01:15:31,317
Oh, Father. Oh, Father.
Hug time.

1254
01:15:31,393 --> 01:15:33,327
There, there, my boy.
Hug your son.

1255
01:15:33,395 --> 01:15:35,522
It's okay. It's okay.
Tighter. Yes.

1256
01:15:35,597 --> 01:15:37,064
Daddy's here.
Hold me.

1257
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:38,594
WOMAN: Good job, sweetheart.

1258
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:40,862
Wow, George.
You are so fast!

1259
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:43,160
What is that?

1260
01:15:43,238 --> 01:15:47,971
I'm not one to brag, but
I call it The Magnificator.

1261
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:50,401
That's so cool.

1262
01:15:50,679 --> 01:15:52,112
Say, have you
seen Sparky?

1263
01:15:52,614 --> 01:15:54,411
I found a rib bone.

1264
01:15:54,483 --> 01:15:55,882
I found a femur.

1265
01:15:55,951 --> 01:15:58,511
I found... Sparky.

1266
01:15:58,654 --> 01:16:01,817
And I am happy to say
that because of Ted...

1267
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:04,120
Sir, George,
don't forget George.

1268
01:16:04,192 --> 01:16:05,819
And George, of course.

1269
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:08,260
We are not going anywhere.

1270
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:11,959
The Bloomsberry Museum
is here to stay.

1271
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:35,014
All right, all right,
last question.

1272
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:38,150
Ted, where will you and George
go for your next adventure?

1273
01:16:38,226 --> 01:16:40,888
The Arctic?
South America? Egypt?

1274
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:45,696
You know, you don't need to go around
the world for a great adventure...

1275
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:48,827
I have a lot of things
to catch up on right here.

1276
01:16:48,904 --> 01:16:50,701
Really?
Really.

1277
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:52,399
Mister, George is...

1278
01:16:52,474 --> 01:16:54,942
I know, he's cute. Lovable.

1279
01:16:55,077 --> 01:16:57,341
Very cute. Very lovable.

1280
01:16:57,579 --> 01:17:00,412
Yeah, well,
he's also in that rocket.

1281
01:17:00,482 --> 01:17:03,178
It's okay.
There's no fuel in it.

1282
01:17:03,251 --> 01:17:04,411
[Rumbling]

1283
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:11,522
Clovis, you didn't put fuel
in that rocket, did you?

1284
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:13,721
Maybe.

1285
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:16,790
Oh, no. I see a rocket
with empty fuel tanks...

1286
01:17:16,865 --> 01:17:18,127
what am I supposed to do?

1287
01:17:20,702 --> 01:17:22,169
George, wait!

1288
01:17:23,538 --> 01:17:24,732
MAN: Bye.
CLOVIS: See you, Ted.

1289
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:26,398
GIRL: Look at all the smoke.
CLOVIS: No hard feelings, huh?

1290
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:28,670
Careful, Ted! Hurry back!

1291
01:17:29,845 --> 01:17:33,337
Okay, but once around the
Earth and then straight home.

1292
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:35,645
Do you hear me? Okay?
I've got plans tonight.

1293
01:17:44,259 --> 01:17:45,351
Gosh.

1294
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:48,358
No, no, no, George,
I'm not letting you drive.

1295
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:49,454
Just sit back and...

1296
01:17:49,531 --> 01:17:52,364
No, George. Don't push that
button. I don't know what it does.

1297
01:17:52,434 --> 01:17:53,765
George, don't...

1298
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:56,599
Hold on, George! Oh, boy!

1299
01:17:57,005 --> 01:17:59,235
That is a surge
of adrenaline.

1300
01:17:59,307 --> 01:18:01,002
I'm going to sleep
good tonight.

1301
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:04,510
