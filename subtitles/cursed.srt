# Who's that I see
walking in these woods?

3
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:15,844
# Why, it's Little Red Riding hood

4
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:19,113
# Hey there, Little Red Riding Hood

5
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,586
# You sure are looking good

6
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:25,955
# You're everything
that a big bad wolf would want

# I don't think even big girls should

10
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:38,529
# Go walking
in these spooky old woods alone

11
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:44,469
# What big eyes you have

12
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,038
You're obsessed with him,

13
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:50,242
I'm not obsessed,
I'm just highly interested.

14
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:52,151
Come on, Let's settle this.

15
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,153
Girls, please, sit, sit.

16
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,654
Let Zela read your palms.

17
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:57,156
Oh, no. Forget it. This is stupid.

18
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,385
so are you. sit down.

19
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:02,686
OK, Zela, this is it.

20
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,395
My friend here is basically obsessed
with this guy that won't call her back

21
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:11,063
and we need to know if she should forget
him cold or hold out for the next 20 years.

22
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:15,942
Well, anyways, whatever you see,
just say 'Forget his ass'.

23
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:19,941
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I need you to read my friend's.

24
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:22,212
Blood.

25
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:25,080
- Excuse me?
- I see blood.

26
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:28,279
so much blood.

27
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:30,917
OK, that's nice, but...

28
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,683
You too.

29
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,922
You're both in danger.

30
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,899
Need to know?
No, Back to the guy.

31
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:42,629
It's not the guy.

32
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,333
It's... it's the beast you should fear.

33
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:47,704
OK.

34
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,675
We're done here.

35
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:53,406
- Come on, Becky. Let's go.
- Beware the moon.

36
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,641
It feeds in the moonlight.

37

You can't tell people this shit.

Hey, looks like you got a visitor.

Hey, there, boy.

Come here.

49
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,153
Zipper. Hey, hey, Zipper.

00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:12,715
Hey.

52
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:17,820

00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:27,401
- Do I know you?
- Oh, yeah, We go to school together.

56
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:31,570
I sit behind you in Government,
Algebra and French.

57
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,237
Oh, really?

58
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,581
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, Brooke Mueller, Jimmy Myers.

59
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,086
M- u, M-y,
I've sat behind you for, like, three years.

60
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,212
- Oh.
- Yeah.

61
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,054
- OK.
- Hey, Brooke, are you ready?

62
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,252
Yeah, almost, Five minutes.

63
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:48,954
- I'll see you at school.
- OK, yeah, No, I know.

64
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:50,860
Hey, I know you.

66
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,133
- Uh, it's Jimmy.
- You're the dodgeball crotch target.

67
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:59,331
- You should really wear a cup.
- Stop it, Bo, OK?

68
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:03,570
I'm just looking out for him, He can't help it,
Every school's got one, the derogatory 'it,'

69
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:06,078
A geek on his way to fag town.

70
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:08,341
- Look, I'm not gay.
- Bummer.

71
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:11,509
You mean you're just
an ass wimp-wad for no reason?

72
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,611
- Yep.
- That sucks.

73
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:16,815
- Boo!
- Whoa!

74
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,484
You're such a dick, Bo.

75
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,586
Just ignore him, Jimmy.

76
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:25,689
- I think your dog is gay too.

77
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,066
What's with the Make-A-Wish
charity case, Brooke?

78
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,507
- Hey, Ellie.
- Hi.

79
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:48,213
- Hello?
- Ellie.

80
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,277
- Hi, Jimmy.
- I'm waiting.

81
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:51,950
Yeah, I know, I stopped by Tinsel
on my way, to see Jake.

82
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,686
- But I'm your brother.
- I'll be there soon.

83
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,092
- Well, how soon?
- I said soon, OK?

84
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:57,357
- Do you know what can happen to me?
- Yes.

85
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:59,922
I know what can happen
to a teenager on Hollywood Boulevard.

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,467
- Do you?
- OK, Quit whining.

87
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:02,763
- Fine.
- Yeah. Bye.

88
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:07,164
Perfect.

89
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:17,045
- Excellent, Excellent!
- Cool.

90
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:20,018
50 grand well-spent.

91
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:24,023
- OK, Looking good up there now.
- You got it.

92
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:27,718
- Ellie.
- Hi.

93
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:29,785
Hi.

94
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:33,998
- How's it going?
- We're not even close to finished.

95
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:39,061
I got four days work and the opening's
in two, I am drowning in stress.

96
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,733
Kiss me again.

97
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,639
- What are you doing here?

98
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,508
- That's good, I told you, That's good.
- I haven't seen you in days.

99
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,777
I wanted to make sure you were still alive.
What is this?

100
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,080
It's a medieval torture device.

101
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:55,053
Which could actually be fun later.

102
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:57,818
Come on,
I'll give you the two-second tour.

103
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:00,382
Spanish lnquisition,

104
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,088
Frankenstein's laboratory,

105
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:05,188
Dracula’s coffin,

106
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:08,828
What's that?

107
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,563
Oh, that.

108
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:15,574
That is a sterling replica to commemorate
the 50th anniversary of the Wolf Man.

109
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:18,202
It was donated by the Chaney estate.

110
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:19,540
Wow.

111
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:22,104
Planet Hollywood
has nothing on you guys.

112
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:25,049
Shh, we don't mention them here.

113
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,546
so, I was thinking,

114
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:31,318
I'll be here for the opening,
and you'll be here.

115
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,053
So how about we be here together?

116
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,857
If I was actually going to the opening.

117
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:41,333
What do you mean? You have to go.
It's your big night. You have to show off.

118
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,995
All I wanna do is crawl into bed
and disappear for three days.

119
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,039
Well, even better.

120
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:48,597
I'll crawl in too.

121
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,911
Excuse me,
I need a signature on this.

122
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,916
Damn. Can you hold on for one second?

123
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:03,252
-  Right there.
-  Thanks.

124
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:05,450
Yeah.

125
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,959
Jake?

126
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,224
Is there something wrong?

127
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:16,535
No. There's nothing wrong. I'm just
stressed out with work and this madness.

128
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:20,198
I just... I need some time
and some space.

129
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,138
OK.

130
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:29,043
Just call me, when you feel like it,
you know. No pressure.

131
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,029
I waited over an hour for you.

132
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:55,006
I'm sorry, OK?

133
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,669
- Do you want to drop it?
- For over an hour, I waited.

134
00:07:57,744 --> 00:08:00,770
Yeah, well, most teenagers
have friends who give them a lift home.

135
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,975
- But then I couldn't inconvenience you.
- Not tonight, Jimmy, Can we just not fight?

136
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,476
Watch out!

137
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:34,079
-  Are you OK?
- Yeah,

138
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:35,842
Zipper.

139
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,440
It's OK, boy.

140
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:42,318
Someone could be hurt.
Find my cellphone. Call for help.

141
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:04,166
- Hello?
-  Oh, God, Help me, Please!

142
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:06,075
I'm coming.

143
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:09,744
Help me, please!

144
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:12,944
I'm coming.
I'm trying to get to you.

145
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:20,192
- Are you OK?
- Please just get me out of here, I'm stuck.

146
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,228
OK. OK.

147
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,855
Oh, God, Help!

148
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:28,025
- Help me, God.
- Can you feel your legs?

149
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:32,461
- I think so, The dashboard's just caved in.
- OK.

150
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:39,135
- Do you have a jack?
- Uh, yeah, Yeah, It's in the trunk.

151
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:42,238
All right, I'm gonna try to go get it, OK?
I'll be right back.

152
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,284
OK, Hurry, please!

153
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:52,424
Oh, God.

154
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:56,326
- Hello? Hello? No, no, I can't hear you.

155
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:58,296
- Shit, AT&&T...

156
00:09:58,365 --> 00:10:01,630
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, stop! stop!

157
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:08,431
- Jesus, people, what's wrong with you?
- 911 emergency. Hello? Hello?

158
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:11,443
- Hello? Wait, wait, Can you hear me now?
- 911 emergency. Yes, I can, sir.

159
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:13,138
- All right, listen, there's been a wreck.
- Where, sir?

160
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:16,046
I'm on Mulholland Drive,
just east of Coldwater.

161
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:36,027
- Jesus.
- Hey, calm down, It's just me.

162
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,865
- I called for help.
- Oh, good.

163
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:40,236
What's going on out there?

164
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,400
I couldn't get the trunk open.

165
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:46,138
but help's on the way, OK?
Just hold on a few more minutes.

166
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:49,443
- Do you hear that?
- What?

167
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:51,575
I hear dripping, like leaking.

168
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,882
Do you smell gas? I smell gas.
Oh, God, The car's gonna blow up.

169
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:58,618
- No, no, no, The car is not gonna blow up.
- Uh, actually it could.

170
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:02,150
- Jesus Christ, get me the fuck out of here!
- OK, all right, all right.

171
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,560
Let me try.

172
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:07,294
Uh, hi.

173
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:09,198
- If I could get up, underneath...
- Just do it!

174
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:11,430
OK, OK. All right.

175
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:15,304
- Wait, All right, I think I'm getting it.
- Oh, God. Please, please.

176
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,400
Wait,
can you be still for a second?

177
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:21,641
You try flipping your car down a mountain
and then being fucking still.

178
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:25,781
Maybe you guys should hurry up.

179
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,649
-  All right. Calm down.
-  I am calm!

180
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:30,417
-  I think I'm getting it.

181
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,390
All right. OK.

182
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:35,152
- OK, I got it.
- Oh, my God. Thank you.

183
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:37,196
Oh, help me with the seat belt.

184
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,925
Oh, shit.

185
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,696
Oh, shit, OK.

186
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:44,760
- OK, OK.
- Oh.

187
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:46,829
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

188
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:50,467
- My legs... There's help. They hurt.

189
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,804
The police are coming.

190
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,110
Yeah, well.
I hope you guys have insurance.

191
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:59,345
What? No, no, it was an accident. We hit
an animal, or it hit us. I'm not even sure.

192
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:02,479
- It wasn't a dog, was it?
- Actually, it was...

193
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:09,254
Ellie! Hold on to me.

194
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,136
Jimmy!

195
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,539
No!

196
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:30,673
Jimmy!

197
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:35,955
Ellie.

198
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:39,825
Go! Go!

199
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:43,727
- Do you think she...?
- No, No, go, Go, go, go,

200
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:58,275
Oh, Jimmy.

201
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,278
Shit, look at your arm.

202
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,417
The police.

203
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,632
No!.

204
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:51,254
- They're ready for us now.
- They said it was pretty nasty.

205
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:57,033
Let me get this straight. It took a bite
out of your arm, but you didn't see it at all?

206
00:13:57,103 --> 00:14:00,231
Well, it all happened so fast
and it was dark.

207
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:04,970
Well, I saw it, It was a wolf, but bigger.
It was like a monster wolf.

208
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,342
Yeah, Jimmy,
I have your statement already.

209
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,973
Fine, don't believe me.
I know what I saw.

210
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:12,745
What happened to her...

211
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:15,481
What kind of an animal could do that?

212
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:17,648
A mountain lion, a bear, maybe.

213
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:23,026
There hasn't been a wolf sighting
in southern California in over 70 years.

214
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:25,587
- Mountain lion, my ass.
- Jimmy.

215
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:27,997
Please.

216
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,865
Why don't you go check on Zipper?

217
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:36,469
Don't worry.
Whatever it was, we'll find it.

218
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:40,908
Hey, buddy, are you OK?

219
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,880
Zipper?

220
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:45,315
- What's wrong?

221
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,478
Hey, smell, It's just me.

222
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:50,216
Hey! Hey, look what you did.

223
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:55,389
That's enough with the biting.

224
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,961
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

225
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:07,031
- Hey, you guys be safe.
-  All right, come on. Let's go.

226
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:17,244
Hey.

227
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:23,787
- Hey, Zipper. Come on in.

228
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:26,484
Hey, Zipper, come on in.

229
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:27,787
Hey. Whoa.

230
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,021
Freak.

231
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,535
- Well, good night.
- Hey.

232
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,070
What?

233
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,130
Don't you wanna talk
about what happened tonight?

234
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:45,575
- What's there to talk about?
- Jimmy, we were attacked.

235
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:47,237
We saw a girl get torn apart.

236
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:51,147
You wanna talk about the bear
or the mountain lion?

237
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:55,017
Look, I know you're mad at me,
but I didn't see what you saw.

238
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:58,785
I'm sorry,
but I don't know what else to say.

239
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:02,521
OK, well, uh, thanks for the talk.
Good night.

240
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:04,563
Oh, come on, Jimmy.

241
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:07,225
I'm trying here.

242
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,253
'Unsolved...'

243
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,055
OK.

244
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:53,135
Jesus, '1600 animal attacks...'

245
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:55,401
'...large wolf-like animals...'

246
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:01,071
Oh, my God.

247
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:03,138
Jesus.

248
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:26,354
- Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
- What are you doing here?

249
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,484
I just... I needed to talk to you.

250
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:32,554
I found the extra key under the mat.
I'm really sorry.

251
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:35,499
I just, I feel so terrible
about how we left things tonight.

252
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:40,471
- Jake, what's going on?
- I'm just scared, Ellie.

253
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,701
I'm scared.

254
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:47,136
I never expected
to meet a woman like you.

255
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:53,618
Jake, you're the only good thing
that's happened in my life in a long time.

256
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:56,052
I'm scared too.

257
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:58,249
I'm terrified,

258
00:20:58,324 --> 00:21:02,192
because all the good things
keep going away.

259
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:07,265
I'm not going anywhere.

260
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:20,233
<i>Here in Los Angeles,
a young woman was attacked and killed</i>

261
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:22,604
<i>by an unidentified wild animal</i>

262
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:26,634
<i>when her car ran off the road last night,
high in the Hollywood hills.</i>

263
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:29,112
<i>the victim's name has yet to be released.</i>

264
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:33,641
<i>It happened on a remote stretch of
Mulholland Drive, shortly before midnight.</i>

265
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:37,155
<i>Animal control officers speculate
that it might have been a bear</i>

266
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:40,158
<i>that wandered into the area
in search of water.</i>

267
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:43,525
<i>It is the first such fatal attack
in Los Angeles...</i>

268
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:09,783
- Hey.
- How are you doing? Did you sleep OK?

269
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:12,187
I woke up in the bushes.

270
00:23:12,258 --> 00:23:14,624
You woke up where?

271
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:17,060
Are you feeling OK?
I'm calling Dr, Steinberg.

272
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:21,065
No, no, I'm fine. Really.
Actually... I feel kinda great.

273
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,297
OK.

274
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:28,400
But I'm gonna make an appointment. They
said we should follow up with another shot.

275
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:31,671
For all we know,
that wolf could've had rabies.

276
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,143
Oh. Oh, so now it's a wolf.

277
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:35,976
Jimmy, I never said it wasn't.
I just said I didn't see it.

278
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:37,913
It was more like a werewolf.

279
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:40,315
And I found this website last night
and according to legend.

280
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:43,287
a werewolf feeds during the lunar cycle -
that's the three nights around the full moon.

281
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:45,255
Last night was the first moon
of the lunar cycle.

282
00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:48,054
Why can't you just download porn
like other teenage boys?

283
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:52,123
Excuse me for trying
to make conversation.

284
00:23:52,198 --> 00:23:54,826
OK, so what would a werewolf
be doing in LA?

285
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,267
shouldn't it be off in the countryside
somewhere, terrorizing helpless maidens?

286
00:23:58,337 --> 00:24:04,298
Maybe it's a hip werewolf, Maidens come
here with the perfectly implanted breasts.

287
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:07,072
- You should get to school,
- Hey, I was bitten by a werewolf.

288
00:24:07,146 --> 00:24:09,842
If that's not good enough for a sick day...
I could be cursed.

289
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:12,213
Everybody's cursed, Jimmy.
It's called life.

290
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,149
No, I mean by the mark of the beast.

291
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,088
Is that what the kids
are calling it these days?

292
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:33,605
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

293
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:42,141
-  Whoa, Hey, Ellie.
- Hey, Kyle.

294
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:45,809
Hey, '70s retro week is booking up, Do we
want Keith Partridge or Marcia Brady?

295
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:47,682
- Only one slot left.
- Marcia, Marcia, Marcia.

296
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:51,314
You look different today,
saucy, I like it.

297
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:54,553
- Yeah, it's new, Gauze look.
- Nice, What happened?

298
00:24:54,627 --> 00:24:58,393
- Oh, you don't wanna know.
- Hey, are you OK?

299
00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:00,932
Yeah. Actually, I'm fine.

300
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:03,659
Incoming psycho publicist, one o'clock.

301
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:07,194
...no trades, Oh, I have to go.
Yeah, OK, Goodbye.

302
00:25:07,273 --> 00:25:09,833
Hi,

303
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:12,503
I didn't recognize you
with your hair down.

304
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:16,947
I just wanted to drop by to make sure we
were set for Scott’s pre-interview tonight.

305
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:21,248
- Absolutely, Nine o'clock.
- Great, Is that what you're gonna wear?

306
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,847
Hey, I heard that you're dating
Jake Taylor, Is that true?

307
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:27,916
- I hope it's nothing serious.
- Why not?

308
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:30,086
I guess it was only a matter of time
before he got to you.

309
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:33,723
- He always did prefer the vulnerable ones.
- OK, well, I'll see you tonight, Joannie.

310
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:36,859
I'm only saying this because I care.

311
00:25:36,936 --> 00:25:39,370
Is there anything else, Joannie?

312
00:25:39,438 --> 00:25:41,838
No, Tonight, Don't be late.

313
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:44,637
- OK, Thank you.
- OK.

314
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:48,673
Putting on weight, Kyle?

315
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:54,179
- What a piece of work.
- I do not like that woman.

316
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:59,054
- No, Apparently Jake didn't either.
- I didn't even know that she knew him.

317
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:02,616
- Do you think she's right about him?
- No, The woman's cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

318
00:26:02,695 --> 00:26:08,429
But I'm not the one dating him.
I just know he's not the only guy in town.

319
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,536
What smells so good?

320
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:19,772
I... I don't smell anything.

321
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:48,565
I get these.

322
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:51,542
It's nothing, I'll live.

323
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:54,507
The blood freaking you out?

324
00:27:04,924 --> 00:27:07,085
- Hey, Brooke, you need some change?
- Hey, Jimmy.

325
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:09,389
That'd be great.
Stupid thing won't take my dollar.

326
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,929
Oh, yeah, OK, Actually...

327
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:14,329
- I'll hold those.
- Thanks.

328
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:17,359
Werewolves, huh?

329
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:20,803
Oh, it's just a stupid report I'm doing.

330
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:23,808
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

331
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:27,039
No, keep your money.
It's on me, Thanks.

332
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:29,376
- Geek juice.

333
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:33,908
- Trying out for the wrestling team, Jimmy?
- Oh, no, I don't wrestle.

334
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:38,787
Oh, I'd think all that male-to-male contact
would be right up your alley.

335
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:44,386
Is, uh... Is that the appeal for you?

336
00:27:44,463 --> 00:27:46,226
Oh, Back talk.

337
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:48,766
Haven't you been team captain
for, like, two years now?

338
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,495
Nicely done, Jimmy.

339
00:27:50,936 --> 00:27:54,099
Did you just attempt a confrontation?

340
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:58,333
- Yeah, maybe.
- Let me know when you're sure.

341
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:03,048
Just ignore him, Jimmy.

342
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:07,616
Let's get out of here
before we get homo-stained.

343
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,847
Hey, Hey.

344
00:28:13,592 --> 00:28:16,584
(# ''freaks come Out At Night''
by Whodini)

345
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:19,587
# Now the party's jumping,
the place is packed

346
00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:21,895
# But when the crowd's like this
I'm ready to rap

347
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:24,060
# But before I could
bust a thyme on the mic

348
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:26,570
# freaks are all over me
like white on rice

349
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:28,333
# freaks come in all shapes
and sizes and colors

350
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:30,841
# But what I like about them most
is that they're real good lovers

351
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:32,934
# they do it in the park,
they do it in the dark

352
00:28:33,012 --> 00:28:34,809
# But most freaks are known
for breaking hearts

353
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,711
Joannie.

354
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:39,941
- Joannie.
- There you are.

355
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:42,510
What is this? Come as
your favorite endangered species?

356
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:44,283
Obnoxious, isn't it?

357
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:47,086
I just feel a little underdressed
without a tail.

358
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:53,155
Well, that's part of your charm,
Take this, I will tell Scott that you're here.

359
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,428
Well, I think you look fantastic.

360
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,564
- What are you doing here?
- I needed to see you.

361
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:05,008
What about the opening?
Disappearing for a few days.

362
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:10,380
- That didn't go over so well, did it?
- You know what? It's fine.

363
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:13,646
We've only been seeing each other
a couple of months, you need your space.

364
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:16,381
I get it, It's fine.

365
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:21,415
Please don't do that. Don't try
to make everything OK when it's not.

366
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:24,826
Can I talk to you in private for a second?

367
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:32,364
Ellie.

368
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:38,901
That was my MO for a long time. When
anything would get too close or too serious.

369
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:41,138
I would just run away.

370
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:43,374
For...

371
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:47,351
For a variety of reasons
that I can't even begin to go into.

372
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:52,618
I don't want to do that with us. This thing,
you and me, this is special, Ellie.

373
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:55,023
and I just don't want to lose you,

374
00:29:55,094 --> 00:29:57,858
so I was hoping that, maybe,

375
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:01,889
you could just bear with me
for a little while longer.

376
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:06,461
I guess I'm learning about these things
as we go along.

377
00:30:07,573 --> 00:30:13,443
Well, maybe I'll finish up here
and we can go someplace to talk.

378
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:16,345
OK. Thank you, Ellie.

379
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:19,111
Well, hi, there, Remember me?

380
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:20,208
Uh...

381
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:23,152
- Jenny Tate, Becky Morton's friend.
- Right. Of course, Jenny.

382
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:25,213
- It's good to see you again, I was actually...
- Jake.

383
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,951
- Hi.
- Hi. Long time no see.

384
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:31,121
Sorry to interrupt an awkward moment,
but we're ready for you.

385
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:33,096
I have to go.

386
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:37,024
- Ellie.
- I'm working.

387
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:41,334
So, Becky cannot stop talking about you.

388
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:43,772
She's gonna die
when she finds out you were here.

389
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,275
Excuse me, I have to go.

390
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:51,806
I know it was only a couple of dates, but
Becky is really bummed you haven't called.

391
00:30:51,884 --> 00:30:56,719
Next time you speak with her, tell her I'm
sorry, but I've taken myself off the market.

392
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:59,052
Now I'm nummed.

393
00:30:59,124 --> 00:31:01,285
Thanks for coming,
I appreciate it, see you later.

394
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,352
Scott, this is Ellie Myers
from the Craig Kilborn show.

395
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:06,727
- Oh, hi, How are you?
- Hi, It's a pleasure to meet you.

396
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,993
I've been a huge fan of yours
ever since happy Days.

397
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:12,764
Thank you. Listen, I appreciate you
meeting me here, I couldn't bail on tonight.

398
00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:13,964
It's fine.

399
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,030
You guys have a nice chat.
I'll be over here if you need me.

400
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:17,939
OK.

401
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:20,843
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

402
00:31:20,913 --> 00:31:24,178
Craig is so excited
to have you on his show.

403
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:27,582
I think it's gonna be
just a fabulous line-up.

404
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:31,979
You'll be going on third,
after Ashton Kutcher and Carrot Top.

405
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,957
- Third?
- Uh...

406
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:36,153
I thought that we would start
with a Chachi clip,

407
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,492
and then move on
to something from Charles in charge.

408
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:40,691
- Original.
- And, uh...

409
00:31:40,766 --> 00:31:43,564
and then we could...

410
00:31:44,303 --> 00:31:49,536
segue into what you're doing now.

411
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:52,603
What are you doing now?

412
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,879
You know, you're a beautiful girl.

413
00:31:58,684 --> 00:32:03,348
I mean, you've got this aura thing
happening, l...

414
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:05,982
I just can't quite put my finger on it.

415
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:08,652
Not when you can use your whole hand.

416
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:12,686
Thank you, I think that's really
all we needed to discuss

417
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,062
and I'll see you in the studio.

418
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:17,397
- OK, You got it.
- OK.

419
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:25,438
Wanna finish your drink?

420
00:32:26,712 --> 00:32:28,475
No, Bye.

421
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:31,709
Okey-doke.

422
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,410
Excuse me.

423
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:35,817
-  Hey, where are you going?
-  Call us!

424
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:37,787
Ellie.

425
00:32:37,856 --> 00:32:39,756
Ellie, wait up.

426
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:42,760
Jake, I really don't feel well tonight,
I just wanna get home.

427
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:46,286
Be careful with this one.
He's trouble.

428
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,959
- Who's the leopard?
- Someone I met before I met you.

429
00:32:52,037 --> 00:32:56,872
- They keep popping up, don't they?
- Ellie, that was a previous life.

430
00:32:56,942 --> 00:32:59,172
Please, you gotta trust me on this.

431
00:32:59,244 --> 00:33:02,407
You know what?
I think it's my turn to be weird.

432
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:05,678
I'm gonna take a cue from you
and disappear for a few days.

433
00:33:05,751 --> 00:33:07,742
Ellie, people can change.

434
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:11,277
I really don't wanna get into it right now.

435
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:39,795
Close, close, close, close!

436
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,536
Oh, my God.

437
00:36:57,916 --> 00:37:01,352
Hello? Hello? Anybody there?
Hello? Hello?

438
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:23,606
Get me the fuck out of here!
Open up!

439
00:38:50,629 --> 00:38:53,120
- Hey.
- Hi.

440
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,198
Are you doing homework?

441
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:03,035
I'm just reading up
on how you kill a werewolf.

442
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:04,541
Silver, right?

443
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:09,637
No, you actually have to separate the head
from the heart, silver just hurts a lot.

444
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:11,909
It might not be such a bad deal.
Think about it.

445
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:15,783
increased strength, heightened senses,
an unnatural sexual allure.

446
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:18,322
When do we sprout hair and pointy ears?

447
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:21,120
It's all a little sketchy,
but maybe never, maybe tomorrow.

448
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,353
The experts can't really agree
on that one.

449
00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:27,526
You're starting to freak me out, Jimmy.
This is fiction, Myth.

450
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,090
We live in reality.
Come back to the other side.

451
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:34,434
I know, I know, but the line between
fiction and fact has always been a thin one.

452
00:39:34,506 --> 00:39:38,203
Don't we have enough problems? Do you
really wanna add this one to the list?

453
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:41,712
OK, here.
Check this out. Here.

454
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,146
It's a five-pointed star.
It's a pentagram.

455
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,706
It's the mark of the beast.

456
00:39:46,785 --> 00:39:49,720
Jimmy, this is ridiculous.
You need...

457
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:51,847
Whoa, Jesus.

458
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:56,520
Wait, is this for real?

459
00:39:57,929 --> 00:40:00,124
Last night was difficult, OK?

460
00:40:00,198 --> 00:40:03,361
The wreck, the girl dying,
it brought up a lot of stuff.

461
00:40:03,435 --> 00:40:06,165
- No, no, no, Ellie, don't start with that.
- I know we don't talk about it enough.

462
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:10,173
- It has nothing to do with Mom and Dad.
- I miss them too.

463
00:40:11,376 --> 00:40:14,436
Your hand.
It's a creepy coincidence.

464
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:18,579
This is some pretty freaky shit.
Admit it.

465
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:22,076
OK, OK.

466
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:25,579
Let's put it to the test.

467
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:32,190
I bought this frame myself,
three years ago.

468
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,198
It's from Tiffany's.
It's sterling silver.

469
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:38,929
Now, if I'm a werewolf.
I shouldn't be able to pick it up, right?

470
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:43,633
- It should hurt me, right?
- According to chapter four, yeah.

471
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:54,150
Go to bed, Jimmy.
It's late.

472
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,307
shut up!

473
00:42:03,421 --> 00:42:05,548
shut up

474
00:42:32,584 --> 00:42:35,712
Don't forget.
I'm working the opening of Tinsel tonight.

475
00:42:35,787 --> 00:42:39,780
- I've gotta take Craig down the red carpet.
- OK.

476
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:57,674
Hello?

477
00:42:59,644 --> 00:43:02,306
Hey, Jake's been calling all morning,
says he needs to talk.

478
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:06,146
Well, I don't need to talk to him,
What's with the gypsies?

479
00:43:06,217 --> 00:43:10,813
Oh, it's auditions for Craig's séance
segment. What is with this new look?

480
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:16,521
- What are you talking about?
- I'm not complaining, I think you look hot.

481
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:20,861
- You're in danger.
- Excuse me?

482
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:23,230
It will come for you.

483
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:27,863
Don't let this getup fool you, I'm not a joke.
I've got the gift, I blame my mother.

484
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:29,930
Why are you talking to me?

485
00:43:33,044 --> 00:43:35,239
You bear the markings of the beast.

486
00:43:35,313 --> 00:43:39,374
Look, I'm not trying to freak you out,
but you've been infected. You're cursed.

487
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,442
You've got to sever the line of the beast.
It's the only way to break the curse.

488
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,250
OK, all psychics
back in their seats, please.

489
00:43:45,323 --> 00:43:48,292
The beast is human too.
Don't forget that.

490
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:51,692
- And it's closer to you than you think.
- If you could just follow me.

491
00:43:51,763 --> 00:43:56,962
Shouldn't you psychically know
when you're annoying someone?

492
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:00,896
Thank you.

493
00:44:01,906 --> 00:44:06,275
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Excuse me, Miss, Get up and get out.

494
00:44:06,711 --> 00:44:08,906
Look at him.

495
00:44:23,194 --> 00:44:24,957
Yeah!

496
00:44:41,813 --> 00:44:44,475
Oh, Brooke, hey.

497
00:44:44,549 --> 00:44:47,541
- Are you stalking me?
- Maybe.

498
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:52,685
What's going on, Brooke?
You going fruit fly on me?

499
00:44:52,757 --> 00:44:56,818
Actually, we were just talking,
but, if you don't mind... shoo.

500
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,629
Oh, you are asking for it, Abercrombie.

501
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,790
Come on, Bo.
You're really becoming transparent.

502
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:03,424
How about a little
identity intervention, OK?

503
00:45:03,501 --> 00:45:07,870
'Cause all this internalized homophobia's
giving you away.

504
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,807
- You better watch your ass.
- What's going on?

505
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:15,812
I'm just giving Jimmy some pointers.

506
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:19,874
- He's here to try out for the team.
- Really? You?

507
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:23,344
Are you sure
you want to do that, Jimmy?

508
00:45:23,421 --> 00:45:25,480
Oh, sure he does, coach.

509
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:29,219
I'll tell you what.
I'll wrestle him.

510
00:45:32,697 --> 00:45:36,189
No, Louie, you and Jimmy take the mat.

511
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:38,929
Jimmy, suit up.

512
00:45:41,439 --> 00:45:43,498
He's so dead.

513
00:45:46,978 --> 00:45:52,075
- OK, limp wrist, stay away from my groin.

514
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:56,785
Take him down, Louie.
Take him down.

515
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:07,029
- Have you had enough?
- Uh-uh.

516
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:09,589
- Let him up.

517
00:46:09,667 --> 00:46:11,794
- Watch his nails, Lou!

518
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:14,429
He might scratch your eyes out!

519
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:32,381
- You OK, Lou?
- All right.

520
00:46:37,395 --> 00:46:39,920
- Let me take a crack, coach.
- Are you up for it, Jimmy?

521
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:42,090
Yeah.

522
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:44,259
Go for it, Bo.

523
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:54,907
- Come on, fairy, shake your dust.
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?

524
00:46:58,182 --> 00:47:00,776
Come on, fag, What?
Do you like that? Huh?

525
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:06,950
Wait, no...

526
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:35,046
You know the best part about being a fairy?
You get to fly.

527
00:47:38,055 --> 00:47:43,049
Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy!

528
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:50,294
- Ashton Kutcher's up first.
- God, he's so overexposed.

529
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:53,804
stick to his film career as talk points.
Don't linger on the TV stuff.

530
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:59,741
And if he doesn't mention the lnternet
sex scandal, just don't bring it up.

531
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:02,370
OK, you know what?
I've done this before.

532
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:04,812
- OK, I bump Baio.
- What?

533
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:07,680
I'm living dangerously.
Carrot Top's rehearsal was funny.

534
00:48:07,752 --> 00:48:10,915
I'm gonna let the Top go long.
Randy's dealing with it.

535
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:13,752
- OK.
- My mouth's dry.

536
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:15,382
Thanks.

537
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:18,826
- You want me to do that?
- I got it. Ouch. Dammit! Look.

538
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,364
What happened?

539
00:48:21,432 --> 00:48:24,492
- Do you have a tissue?
- Just stare at it.

540
00:48:26,971 --> 00:48:30,065
<i>It's the Late Late Show
with Craig Kilborn.</i>

541
00:48:30,141 --> 00:48:33,008
OK, Go, Go! You're on.

542
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:36,376
<i>Mr Craig Kilborn.</i>

543
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,820
Excuse me.
Excuse me, Ellie?

544
00:48:52,897 --> 00:48:55,195
What the fuck do you mean.
'Scott’s been bumped?'

545
00:48:55,633 --> 00:48:58,693
- I just heard, We'll reschedule.
- Reschedule, my ass.

546
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:01,636
- I'm sorry, The show was running long.
- Then bump Carrot Top.

547
00:49:01,706 --> 00:49:04,573
It's Scott Baio, He shouldn't be
going after Carrot Top anyway.

548
00:49:04,642 --> 00:49:06,269
- He should be first.
- I'll make it up to you.

549
00:49:06,344 --> 00:49:10,075
- Listen to me, you little...
- Don't start with me!

550
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:31,827
Hi, Ellie.

551
00:49:41,379 --> 00:49:43,813
Are you OK in there?

552
00:49:43,881 --> 00:49:45,906
I'm fine.

553
00:49:49,587 --> 00:49:52,317
You don't sound fine.

554
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:06,968
What's the matter?

555
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:15,371
Ellie?

556
00:50:15,446 --> 00:50:17,277
No!

557
00:50:24,455 --> 00:50:26,218
Ellie.

558
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:35,864
Ellie, your hand.

559
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:49,311
Ellie.

560
00:50:50,281 --> 00:50:52,511
What's wrong?

561
00:50:52,583 --> 00:50:56,019
I'm just having a really bad day.

562
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:58,882
Just leave.

563
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:02,651
Can I help?

564
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:05,890
Get the hell out of here! Get out!

565
00:51:30,121 --> 00:51:31,952
Hey, Jake.

566
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:33,717
- Jimmy.
- Hey.

567
00:51:33,791 --> 00:51:36,191
Cool place.
Are all clubs like this?

568
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:39,423
I sure hope not or I'm in nig trouble.

569
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:43,889
So what's up, Jimmy?
What are you doing here?

570
00:51:43,968 --> 00:51:48,371
Yeah, l... I kind of need someone
to talk to. Is that OK?

571
00:51:49,373 --> 00:51:52,103
Yeah, of course it is,
step inside.

572
00:51:52,176 --> 00:51:58,206
OK, look, Ellie won't admit it, but ever since
the other night things have been different.

573
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:00,409
- We're different.
- What night? What are you talking about?

574
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:02,816
- Didn't Ellie tell you?
- No, Tell me what?

575
00:52:02,887 --> 00:52:07,824
We were in a wreck in the canyon.
A girl was killed.

576
00:52:07,892 --> 00:52:10,554
she was ripped apart.

577
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:12,289
By...

578
00:52:12,363 --> 00:52:14,763
I don't know, by some kind of animal.

579
00:52:14,832 --> 00:52:18,029
Whatever it was bit me and now
things have been happening to me.

580
00:52:18,102 --> 00:52:21,196
Things I can't explain.
Jake, I know it sounds crazy.

581
00:52:21,272 --> 00:52:24,799
nut I think it was a...

582
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:26,968
a werewolf.

583
00:52:27,044 --> 00:52:29,069
Hm,

584
00:52:29,547 --> 00:52:32,539
- What does your sister say about all this?
- You know Ellie.

585
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:36,985
Deny and avoid. It's her thing. But it got
her too and now I think we're cursed.

586
00:52:37,054 --> 00:52:39,079
Look, I almost
took a guy's head off in gym.

587
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:43,820
I'm not the kind of guy to take
another guy's head off, I mean, look at me.

588
00:52:43,894 --> 00:52:46,260
What if it comes back?

589
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:52,360
I mean, I know enough to know that it's
a who, not a what, so it could be pissed off.

590
00:52:52,436 --> 00:52:53,926
It may want to finish what it started.

591
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:56,336
Jimmy, I think
you just need to calm down.

592
00:52:56,407 --> 00:52:59,899
I think the best thing we can do
is just call your sister.

593
00:52:59,977 --> 00:53:03,970
Get her down here and maybe the three
of us should just sit down and discuss it.

594
00:53:04,048 --> 00:53:07,745
I don't want to discuss this, I've been
cursed, something bad is gonna happen.

595
00:53:07,818 --> 00:53:09,809
I can... Look, I can feel it.

596
00:53:09,887 --> 00:53:12,822
Jimmy, listen to yourself.

597
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:15,723
Werewolves?

598
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:20,660
- This was a mistake, sorry I bothered you.
- Jimmy.

599
00:53:20,731 --> 00:53:23,063
No, no, Thanks.

600
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:20,417
Jesus Christ.

601
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:31,792
- Bo, What are you doing here?
- I just wanted to, kind of, talk.

602
00:54:31,869 --> 00:54:34,667
About that stuff you said today.

603
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:40,108
What stuff?

604
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:44,347
About me,
I was just wondering how you knew.

605
00:54:44,415 --> 00:54:47,248
No one else did, just you.

606
00:54:47,318 --> 00:54:51,914
And I've been so shitty to you,
And then I thought,

607
00:54:51,989 --> 00:54:55,152
why wouldn't you know?
It takes one to know one, right?

608
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:59,093
- Of course, you would know.
- Know what?

609
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:05,360
Whoa, Whoa,
What are you doing?

610
00:55:05,436 --> 00:55:07,802
I'm gay.

611
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:12,808
I just can't keep it in anymore, I had to tell
you, you're the only other gay guy I know.

612
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:16,073
Whoa, OK, stop. No, I'm not gay.
Not that there's anything wrong with it.

613
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:20,845
- This is hard for me. Don't be like this.
- Trust me, Bo. I'm not gay. I'm cursed.

614
00:55:20,918 --> 00:55:24,820
I know, sure feels like that, doesn't it?
Not being able to tell anyone.

615
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:27,686
- Talk to anyone about it.
- No, I'm cursed by the mark of the beast.

616
00:55:27,758 --> 00:55:29,282
Bo.

617
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,794
I'm a werewolf.

618
00:55:34,031 --> 00:55:37,159
Come on, Jimmy. You don't
have to pretend anymore. Not with me.

619
00:55:37,234 --> 00:55:42,035
No, it's part of the curse. I'm appealing.
I have an unnatural sexual allure.

620
00:55:42,106 --> 00:55:43,801
Yeah, yeah, you do, I know.

621
00:55:43,874 --> 00:55:46,035
Look, dude, I'm happy for you.
You be gay. It's a good thing.

622
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:50,240
Unfortunately, I got my own shit
to take care of, so best of luck. Yay, go gay.

623
00:55:50,314 --> 00:55:52,714
And I'll see you.

624
00:55:53,951 --> 00:55:55,748
Hey, Jimmy, wait.

625
00:55:55,819 --> 00:55:57,218
Jimmy.

626
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:27,212
- Liar.

627
00:56:31,522 --> 00:56:33,581
Hey, Zipper.

628
00:56:34,358 --> 00:56:35,484
Hey.

629
00:56:42,766 --> 00:56:44,256
Hey.

630
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:46,928
Hey, Zipper.
Hey, that's mine.

631
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:50,405
Hey, Hey, Zipper. Drop it.

632
00:56:50,841 --> 00:56:52,900
Hey, No, drop it.

633
00:56:53,377 --> 00:56:55,504
Zip.

634
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:58,047
Hey, Hey, come on.
Get out of it. Let's go.

635
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:02,779
No, Zipper!

636
00:57:02,853 --> 00:57:04,047
Zipper.

637
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:17,734
- Zipper.

638
00:57:19,336 --> 00:57:21,566
- Bo, what are you doing here?
- We're not through yet.

639
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:24,436
No, no, no.
We gotta go. Now.

640
00:57:25,242 --> 00:57:28,734
- Holy shit.
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Go! Come on.

641
00:57:31,482 --> 00:57:33,712
Fuck me.

642
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:50,726
- What the fuck was that?
- That was my dog.

643
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:53,361
- What kind of dog do you have?
- I have a regular dog.

644
00:57:53,437 --> 00:57:56,497
Or he was, until he bit me.
I infected him.

645
00:57:57,508 --> 00:58:00,500
- I told you. I'm a werewolf.
- Oh, yeah. Right.

646
00:58:02,246 --> 00:58:04,441
- You're fucking serious.
- Yeah.

647
00:58:04,515 --> 00:58:07,973
Look, I gotta find my sister.
Give me your cellphone.

648
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:12,112
Thanks, I know. Just keep your eyes on the
road, all right? Animals, they sometimes...

649
00:58:17,561 --> 00:58:20,928
shit, stupid canyons. Look,
she's going to a club opening, at Tinsel.

650
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:24,126
- Oh, on the strip. Got it, I'm with you.
- OK, All right, settle down.

651
00:58:32,176 --> 00:58:36,135
<i>...killed 23 people
and wounded more than 100 on Saturday.</i>

652
00:58:36,213 --> 00:58:40,513
<i>In breaking news,
is a wild beast terrorizing the Southland?</i>

653
00:58:40,584 --> 00:58:43,052
<i>Another woman,
Jenny rate of Studio city,</i>

654
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:46,248
<i>was torn to pieces
at a charity benefit last night.</i>

655
00:58:46,323 --> 00:58:49,918
<i>Authorities have linked the incident
to a similar attack on Mulholland Drive</i>

656
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:53,793
<i>just two nights ago, where Becky Morton
was mauled to death by an animal...</i>

657
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:56,628
I'll drink, you can drive.

658
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,759
Ready?

659
00:58:58,836 --> 00:59:03,170
Kyle, can you cover for me tonight?
I've gotta get home.

660
00:59:04,174 --> 00:59:06,574
You're gonna miss Jake's big opening?

661
00:59:06,643 --> 00:59:09,476
- Ellie?
- I guess.

662
00:59:14,785 --> 00:59:17,754
- Good night, Ellie.
- Oh, good night.

663
00:59:30,801 --> 00:59:32,393
Ellie.

664
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:35,063
Ellie, please.

665
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:42,101
You scared me.

666
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:45,580
I'm sorry,
but I needed to talk to you, Ellie.

667
00:59:45,649 --> 00:59:48,117
You haven't been returning my calls.

668
00:59:48,185 --> 00:59:52,019
You knew those girls, Becky and Jenny.

669
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:54,751
They're both dead.

670
00:59:54,825 --> 00:59:58,921
I know, but, Ellie,
I can explain everything.

671
00:59:58,996 --> 01:00:00,520
Ellie!

672
01:00:01,865 --> 01:00:04,459
Ellie, Ellie!

673
01:00:17,881 --> 01:00:20,543
Get out of the car, Ellie.

674
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:24,810
Please.

675
01:00:31,261 --> 01:00:33,695
Look, I'm sorry about your window.
I didn't mean to do that.

676
01:00:33,764 --> 01:00:37,791
but I have a lot of things
that I have to explain to you

677
01:00:37,868 --> 01:00:43,238
and they're all going to sound a little crazy
so I just need you to hear me out.

678
01:00:43,307 --> 01:00:45,502
Give me back my keys first.

679
01:00:54,117 --> 01:00:57,177
What attacked you in the canyon
wasn't just an animal.

680
01:00:57,254 --> 01:01:01,657
- What was it?
- You already know the answer to that.

681
01:01:01,725 --> 01:01:03,955
You can feel the changes, can't you?

682
01:01:08,565 --> 01:01:10,760
Ellie!

683
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:34,479
How's it going? These are my plus-ones
right here, all the way to the end, there.

684
01:01:34,558 --> 01:01:36,822
Hey, man.

685
01:01:36,893 --> 01:01:40,192
- Hey, Bo, can I use your cell?
- Uh, yeah, sure.

686
01:01:40,263 --> 01:01:44,666
Hey, I'm gonna go look.
see if anybody's seen your sister,

687
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,031
- Hello?
- Ellie?

688
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:55,738
- Jimmy, thank God. Where are you?
- I'm at Tinsel.

689
01:01:55,812 --> 01:01:57,040
- What?
- No, it's OK.

690
01:01:57,114 --> 01:01:59,480
What are you doing there?
I'm on my way home.

691
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:02,382
Ellie, don't go home. Look,
I infected Zipper and he's gone werewolf.

692
01:02:02,452 --> 01:02:05,979
- You gotta believe me. Look, it's all true.
- I believe you, OK?

693
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:08,183
I'd believe anything at this point.

694
01:02:08,258 --> 01:02:10,522
- Jimmy, it's Jake.
- What? Jake?

695
01:02:10,594 --> 01:02:12,653
he's the one who attacked us.
he's the werewolf.

696
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:16,688
- Ellie, I'm freaking out.
- Kyle should be there, OK? Just find him.

697
01:02:16,767 --> 01:02:19,861
stay low.
Jake is definitely gonna be there.

698
01:02:19,936 --> 01:02:22,268
I'll be there as soon as I can.

699
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:34,374
Jimmy. Have you seen Ellie?
I just really need to find her, right away.

700
01:02:34,518 --> 01:02:36,713
- Jake, Hi.
- Hi.

701
01:02:36,787 --> 01:02:38,721
- The place looks amazing.
- Thank you.

702
01:02:38,789 --> 01:02:41,155
- lncredible. Congratulations. Excuse me.
- Wait, Jimmy, I really need to...

703
01:02:41,224 --> 01:02:44,250
Did I introduce you to Scott?
Scott, this is Jake.

704
01:02:44,327 --> 01:02:46,727
- Hey, man. How are you doing?
- Good, thanks, Thanks for coming.

705
01:02:46,797 --> 01:02:50,062
Can I excuse myself for one second?

706
01:02:50,133 --> 01:02:51,566
- Jimmy?
- What am I doing here?

707
01:02:51,635 --> 01:02:55,537
Do you have any idea who I had to blow
to get you in here tonight?

708
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:57,869
Who do I have to blow to get out of here?

709
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:03,246
- That thing looks real.
- I think it is.

710
01:03:03,313 --> 01:03:06,373
- Find your sister?
- No, actually...

711
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:09,385
- Oh, shit, shit, shit.
- What? Is he a werewolf hunter?

712
01:03:09,453 --> 01:03:10,579
No, no, He's trouble.

713
01:03:10,654 --> 01:03:13,623
Tell the guys to look out for a young guy,
about yea tall, brown hair.

714
01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:14,884
He's a little jumpy so be discreet.

715
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:17,859
Here, come on.
I think we can cut through here.

716
01:03:18,862 --> 01:03:21,660
Come on. Come on.
We can get out the back way. Come on.

717
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:29,801
Kyle.

718
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,530
Kyle.

719
01:03:31,608 --> 01:03:34,304
- Kyle, Have you seen my brother?
- Jimmy's here?

720
01:03:34,377 --> 01:03:37,904
- I've gotta find him, it's an emergency.
- Ellie, you need to tell me what's going on.

721
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:41,508
- I wish I could.
- Hey, have you seen Kilborn?

722
01:03:41,585 --> 01:03:44,452
He ditched me.

723
01:03:57,501 --> 01:04:01,096
- ...out of here, baby.
-  Hold on. Find me...

724
01:04:01,171 --> 01:04:02,638
-  Help!

725
01:04:02,706 --> 01:04:06,005
-  Which way is out?
- I don't know. Here. Come on, come on.

726
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:12,614
-  Bo, over here,
- Jimmy?

727
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:16,046
Ellie.

728
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:19,614
- Please, Ellie. Don't be afraid.
- Stay away from me, Jake.

729
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:23,785
-  But it wasn't me.
- Bullshit, I saw your hands.

730
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,658
-  There's another one like me.
- Is that your sister?

731
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:28,925
-  I think so.
- I don't know who it is.

732
01:04:28,999 --> 01:04:32,594
But that's who killed those girls.
It's trying to get to me.

733
01:04:32,669 --> 01:04:34,830
Please, you have to believe me.
I'm telling you the truth.

734
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:41,870
- I don't know what to believe.
- Ellie, I was born with this curse.

735
01:04:41,945 --> 01:04:44,709
I know how to control it.

736
01:04:45,148 --> 01:04:49,209
I've learned to live with something terrible.
Just like you.

737
01:04:49,286 --> 01:04:51,811
We're not that different.

738
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:54,186
- We can do this.
- How do you know that?

739
01:04:54,257 --> 01:04:56,691
Because, Ellie.

740
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:58,785
- I love you.
- No!

741
01:04:58,862 --> 01:05:00,830
- Please.
- Ellie. Come on.

742
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,057
Ellie.

743
01:05:02,132 --> 01:05:04,657
I love you.

744
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:06,463
Please.

745
01:05:12,709 --> 01:05:14,540
Jake!

746
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,342
Where is it?
Where are they?

747
01:05:39,102 --> 01:05:42,071
-  Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go!
- Shit!

748
01:05:43,873 --> 01:05:46,774
- OK, you go that way, I'll go this way.
- OK.

749
01:05:48,478 --> 01:05:51,538
- Bo?

750
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,809
Bo?

751
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:55,643
No, don't go in there.
It's not safe.

752
01:05:55,719 --> 01:05:57,778
No, Stop.

753
01:05:57,854 --> 01:06:02,723
Randy, Randy, you gotta get everyone
out of there and you gotta radio for help.

754
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,282
Why?

755
01:06:18,041 --> 01:06:20,737
Are you OK?
Come on, get up.

756
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:23,771
- Ellie!
- Jimmy.

757
01:06:23,847 --> 01:06:26,281
Come on.
It's a fucking werewolf.

758
01:06:36,059 --> 01:06:37,321
Jimmy!

759
01:06:39,095 --> 01:06:41,154
- Have you seen my brother?
- He must be out front.

760
01:06:41,231 --> 01:06:43,665
No, he's not, I've looked everywhere.
He's not out there.

761
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:45,795
- There's nobody left in there except for...

762
01:06:45,869 --> 01:06:47,268
...that!

763
01:06:48,905 --> 01:06:50,167
Jimmy!

764
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:55,273
Jimmy!

765
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:06,512
Jimmy.

766
01:07:20,704 --> 01:07:22,501
Jimmy.

767
01:07:23,506 --> 01:07:24,700
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

768
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:27,538
- OK. We gotta get outta here.
- I know.

769
01:07:29,946 --> 01:07:32,881
- Ellie.
- Kyle, what...

770
01:07:32,949 --> 01:07:34,940
What the hell's happening?

771
01:07:35,018 --> 01:07:39,887
I heard people screaming,
and then I lost Craig, I lost Craig.

772
01:07:39,956 --> 01:07:42,982
- Stay away from us.
- What? Why?

773
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:45,323
Show me your hand.

774
01:07:47,030 --> 01:07:50,659
- The other hand.
- Ellie.

775
01:07:50,734 --> 01:07:52,998
We don't have time for this.

776
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:57,472
There's an animal on the loose.
It could be anywhere.

777
01:08:01,378 --> 01:08:04,438
What? You guys hear something?

778
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:15,413
- Where the fuck did he go?
- I don't know.

779
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:23,061
Jimmy?

780
01:08:33,743 --> 01:08:35,176
Come on.

781
01:08:35,245 --> 01:08:36,974
- Come on, come on. Keep going.
- But it's closed.

782
01:08:37,046 --> 01:08:39,344
- Shit, we can't get out. We're fucked.
- Where are we going?

783
01:08:39,416 --> 01:08:43,318
I don't know, shit.
Where does this go? Come on.

784
01:08:44,921 --> 01:08:49,221
- Shit,
- There should be doors. Look for a door.

785
01:08:51,561 --> 01:08:54,962
- There's nothing. Look over there.
- OK.

786
01:08:58,735 --> 01:09:01,568
No, they're not here.

787
01:09:03,773 --> 01:09:05,866
- Weren't there three?
- What?

788
01:09:05,942 --> 01:09:08,069
There's three microphones.
There's only two...

789
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:10,442
Jimmy!

790
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:17,009
- Showtime. lsn't that what they say?
- Joannie.

791
01:09:17,086 --> 01:09:19,953
Just for the record, I didn't ask for this.

792
01:09:20,023 --> 01:09:23,686
It was just a hot night
with the guy that every girl in town wanted.

793
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:26,490
Lucky me,
I should've been more careful though.

794
01:09:26,563 --> 01:09:32,331
I got a little rough in bed and wound up
cursed by the mark of the fucking beast.

795
01:09:33,369 --> 01:09:37,499
- That Jake, he's a catch.
- Oh, my God.

796
01:09:37,941 --> 01:09:41,775
I thought he was the one, you know, but all
I got was a couple of dates, some hot sex,

797
01:09:41,845 --> 01:09:46,043
and a 'I'm not ready for a relationship
right now, It's not you, it's me,'

798
01:09:46,483 --> 01:09:49,475
Men, They're all beasts.

799
01:09:49,552 --> 01:09:53,488
Jake didn't want me.
And if I can't have him...

800
01:09:54,257 --> 01:09:56,885
- Well, you know how that line goes.
- Hey, l...

801
01:10:03,633 --> 01:10:06,193
The funny thing is,
I never saw you as a threat.

802
01:10:06,269 --> 01:10:09,363
I find you rather depressing myself.

803
01:10:10,006 --> 01:10:14,466
Why do men always go for
the tortured ones? Poor damaged Ellie.

804
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:16,739
Fuck you.

805
01:10:17,313 --> 01:10:19,372
Bitch!

806
01:10:22,986 --> 01:10:25,181
Who's lost it now?

807
01:10:38,468 --> 01:10:43,565
OK, Just the two of us, Fair fight, OK?
Just me and you, All right? Come on.

808
01:10:44,107 --> 01:10:46,735
- OK,
- I'm right here.

809
01:10:46,809 --> 01:10:49,039
OK, Let's go.

810
01:10:51,948 --> 01:10:54,712
Fair fight?
This is Hollywood.

811
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:57,475
And you...

812
01:10:57,554 --> 01:11:00,421
You get one taste of blood
and you freak out.

813
01:11:04,694 --> 01:11:07,219
Jimmy, Jimmy.

814
01:11:29,252 --> 01:11:31,311
Come on, run.

815
01:11:48,037 --> 01:11:51,006
Jake? You bounce back quickly.

816
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:53,900
Hi.

817
01:11:54,344 --> 01:11:58,144
- It's you?
- Yeah.

818
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:02,379
- How did this happen, Joannie?
- Well.

819
01:12:02,452 --> 01:12:08,186
I guess there's no such thing
as safe sex with a werewolf.

820
01:12:11,294 --> 01:12:16,561
Joannie, it doesn't have to be like this
for you, There are ways for you to control it.

821
01:12:16,633 --> 01:12:20,069
Like what? Nibbling on coyotes
in the desert# No thanks.

822
01:12:20,136 --> 01:12:22,604
I'm having too much fun
eliminating the competition.

823
01:12:22,672 --> 01:12:25,664
Pretty soon I'll have you all to myself.

824
01:12:26,542 --> 01:12:29,306
I won't let you kill her, Joannie.

825
01:12:29,946 --> 01:12:31,140
Jake!

826
01:12:31,214 --> 01:12:33,273
Honey, muffin.

827
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:36,216
I am not gonna kill her, I promise.

828
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:40,483
I'm just gonna rip her to shreds
and let her choke on her own blood.

829
01:12:40,556 --> 01:12:42,046
Then...

830
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:44,150
maybe I'll eat her.

831
01:12:44,227 --> 01:12:47,025
You have to kill me first.

832
01:12:51,934 --> 01:12:54,528
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

833
01:12:54,604 --> 01:13:00,372
Well, I've learned a few things about
this curse along the way, and I know better.

834
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:06,508
But that doesn't mean
I can't make it hurt a little.

835
01:13:20,663 --> 01:13:23,496
- I don't see her.
- Sh.

836
01:13:54,664 --> 01:13:56,655
Ellie?

837
01:14:11,013 --> 01:14:14,141
Let's see how she deals with these.

838
01:14:18,821 --> 01:14:21,654
I'm gonna get you.

839
01:14:21,724 --> 01:14:25,125
Where are you, you bitch?

840
01:14:25,194 --> 01:14:28,061
Get this off!

841
01:14:34,403 --> 01:14:37,497
Where's your brother?

842
01:15:22,819 --> 01:15:26,277
- Where'd she go?
- I don't know.

843
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:29,017
- Well, maybe she left.

844
01:15:29,992 --> 01:15:32,460
Or maybe not.

845
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:47,141
- Did she see us?
- I don't think...

846
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:50,043
Run! Jimmy, get out of here.

847
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:55,883
Jimmy!

848
01:16:11,601 --> 01:16:13,364
Ellie.

849
01:16:30,953 --> 01:16:32,352
Ellie, wake up.

850
01:16:35,658 --> 01:16:37,683
Wake up.

851
01:16:59,482 --> 01:17:01,677
You're playing with us,
aren't you, Joannie?

852
01:17:01,751 --> 01:17:02,945
Ellie.

853
01:17:04,287 --> 01:17:06,448
Well, play this!

854
01:17:18,534 --> 01:17:21,025
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

855
01:17:21,103 --> 01:17:22,536
- Move along, Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

856
01:17:22,605 --> 01:17:23,663
Shit!

857
01:17:32,982 --> 01:17:34,540
Move it.

858
01:17:34,617 --> 01:17:36,881
- Freeze!.
- Don't shoot.

859
01:17:36,953 --> 01:17:41,083
- Where's the animal?
- It's up there somewhere.

860
01:17:41,157 --> 01:17:44,217
- What's it supposed to be?
- I don't know, stay alert, guys.

861
01:17:44,293 --> 01:17:48,992
- What the hell is it, anyway?
- Oh, it's a werewolf. What?

862
01:17:50,099 --> 01:17:53,091
- Did you say werewolf?
- Yeah.

863
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:55,467
she may have changed back
to her human form.

864
01:17:55,538 --> 01:17:59,804
Her name is Joannie.
She's this hyper, skinny publicist.

865
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:04,337
- Any other description?
- Yeah, she's, what?! Like, five foot seven?

866
01:18:04,413 --> 01:18:07,473
She's got a bony ass,

867
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:11,111
and fat thighs, and bad skin,

868
01:18:11,187 --> 01:18:14,020
Liar!

869
01:18:15,791 --> 01:18:17,520
Shoot!

870
01:18:25,568 --> 01:18:28,731
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

871
01:18:42,451 --> 01:18:45,511
- Man, that's ugly.
- Careful.

872
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:50,488
It's dead. All clear.

873
01:18:51,127 --> 01:18:53,186
- That's fucked up.
- Yeah. OK.

874
01:18:53,262 --> 01:18:56,288
- Stand down.
- What is this thing?

875
01:18:56,365 --> 01:18:59,698
I told you, it's a werewolf.
You have to separate the head from the..

876
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:07,232
Repeat, all clear.

877
01:19:07,309 --> 01:19:10,278
Call animal control.

878
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:13,610
- Get them out of here.
Is she dead?

879
01:19:13,682 --> 01:19:17,914
Yeah. Her brain's on the floor.
That should do it.

880
01:19:17,987 --> 01:19:20,785
- Jake.
- Bo.

881
01:19:20,856 --> 01:19:23,654
Hey, I need a paramedic in here.

882
01:19:29,965 --> 01:19:32,399
Bo, Bo, Bo.

883
01:19:32,468 --> 01:19:34,732
- Yeah.
- Are you OK?

884
01:19:36,205 --> 01:19:40,005
- Hey, Jimbo. How'd I do?
- You did good.

885
01:19:40,076 --> 01:19:42,636
- I'm gonna go look for Jake, OK?
- Yeah.

886
01:19:42,711 --> 01:19:44,906
Hey, you good?

887
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:48,575
Yeah. He sucker-punched me.
I was about to kick his ass.

888
01:19:48,651 --> 01:19:50,744
OK.

889
01:19:57,993 --> 01:20:00,461
Did you find him?

890
01:20:01,464 --> 01:20:03,523
No.

891
01:20:09,371 --> 01:20:12,534
- I'm telling you, we shot the shit out of this.
- Really?

892
01:20:12,608 --> 01:20:16,009
You're gonna need a forklift.
This thing is...

893
01:20:16,078 --> 01:20:18,444
huge.

894
01:20:18,514 --> 01:20:21,244
I think we can handle it.

895
01:20:23,152 --> 01:20:26,246
It looked a little bigger before.

896
01:20:26,689 --> 01:20:28,680
Oh, shit!

897
01:20:50,212 --> 01:20:52,510
- Are you OK?
- Are you all right?

898
01:20:52,581 --> 01:20:55,049
- I think so.
- Yeah.

899
01:20:58,354 --> 01:21:01,414
so, it's over, right?

900
01:21:01,490 --> 01:21:05,017
And Joannie's dead, so we're OK now..

901
01:21:05,094 --> 01:21:10,396
Well, that's subjective, We still have
to go back to our pathetic precurse lives.

902
01:21:10,466 --> 01:21:14,835
- I'm personally OK with that.
- Well, you're not in high school.

903
01:21:20,609 --> 01:21:23,100
What happened?

904
01:21:23,179 --> 01:21:24,373
Zipper.

905
01:21:40,763 --> 01:21:42,856
Are you OK?

906
01:21:43,866 --> 01:21:46,096
I will be.

907
01:21:47,102 --> 01:21:50,697
What's wrong?
Are you worried about Jake?

908
01:21:50,773 --> 01:21:54,265
- His secret's out. He had to disappear.
- I don't want to talk about it, OK?

909
01:21:54,343 --> 01:21:56,777
I know you think he's a good guy, Ellie,
but don't forget, all of this...

910
01:21:56,845 --> 01:21:59,439
...everything we've been through,
is because of him.

911
01:21:59,515 --> 01:22:01,107
When it comes down to it,
a monster is still a monster.

912
01:22:01,183 --> 01:22:03,845
Jimmy. That's enough.

913
01:22:05,321 --> 01:22:08,552
I guess some things never change.

914
01:22:08,624 --> 01:22:14,290
- Do you think you can get us some light?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'll check the circuit breaker.

915
01:22:26,508 --> 01:22:28,567
Zipper?

916
01:22:39,088 --> 01:22:44,116
- How are you doing with those lights?
- Yeah, one second.

917
01:22:44,593 --> 01:22:45,685
Shit.

918
01:22:45,761 --> 01:22:48,252
Is everything OK down there?

919
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:51,094
Yeah, it's fine, I just...

920
01:23:43,385 --> 01:23:45,512
Thank you.

921
01:24:33,135 --> 01:24:35,194
Zipper?

922
01:24:41,176 --> 01:24:43,235
It's OK, It's just me.

923
01:24:43,312 --> 01:24:47,942
Sorry, I'm still working on the fuses. It's
a little dark in here, I'll be up in a minute.

924
01:24:48,851 --> 01:24:51,012
Jake.

925
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:53,350
How are you, Ellie?

926
01:24:53,422 --> 01:24:56,550
Jake, something's wrong, I'm...

927
01:24:57,059 --> 01:24:58,686
- Sh.

928
01:24:58,761 --> 01:25:01,662
It'll be OK. Just breathe.
You'll be OK.

929
01:25:01,730 --> 01:25:05,393
- What's happening to me?
- It's starting, Ellie.

930
01:25:06,835 --> 01:25:09,531
- It's almost midnight.
- Oh, no.

931
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:10,799
No.

932
01:25:10,873 --> 01:25:13,034
- This can't happen, Jake.
- Ellie.

933
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:15,542
Ellie, sh. It's OK.
You're gonna be OK.

934
01:25:15,611 --> 01:25:17,806
- I came back for you.
- I have to stop it.

935
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:21,281
- You have to help me stop it.
- Ellie, it's not really that simple.

936
01:25:21,350 --> 01:25:23,875
But you have nothing to worry about.
This is how we can be together.

937
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:25,852
You need this, Ellie.

938
01:25:25,921 --> 01:25:28,481
You need me.

939
01:25:32,027 --> 01:25:34,018
- You said it could be controlled.
- You don't have to worry.

940
01:25:34,096 --> 01:25:37,554
I can teach you how to live with this.
And we have years to figure it out.

941
01:25:37,633 --> 01:25:41,228
So that's your answer?
We live happily ever after?

942
01:25:41,303 --> 01:25:43,168
There's no reason why we can't now,

943
01:25:48,844 --> 01:25:50,937
Think about it.
Your parents are dead.

944
01:25:51,013 --> 01:25:53,243
Your brother is miserable,
your life is a mess.

945
01:25:53,315 --> 01:25:56,284
Why do you think it is
that you fell for me so hard and so fast?

946
01:25:56,351 --> 01:26:00,185
I gave you a reason to live again, Ellie.
And I can still do that for you.

947
01:26:00,255 --> 01:26:02,883
- Jake, I don't want this.
- It's the only way we can be together, Ellie.

948
01:26:02,958 --> 01:26:07,622
But I don't want you.
Tell me how to get rid of it. Tell me how!

949
01:26:07,696 --> 01:26:11,860
The only way you can break the curse
is for the one who started it all to die.

950
01:26:11,934 --> 01:26:14,402
And that’s me.

951
01:26:14,470 --> 01:26:18,702
- I'm not ready to die just yet.
- I can't let my brother live like this.

952
01:26:18,774 --> 01:26:21,641
You know I have to think of him first.

953
01:26:22,644 --> 01:26:27,581
I know, I bet you promised your parents
that you'd give him a good life, didn't you?

954
01:26:27,649 --> 01:26:31,449
But you know what, Ellie. You're
really not doing a very good job, are you?

955
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:35,183
- In fact, you're kind of a disaster.
- Get away from me.

956
01:26:44,266 --> 01:26:46,598
I don't want you
to worry about your brother, OK?

957
01:26:46,835 --> 01:26:49,497
After all,
there's only room for one alpha male.

958
01:26:49,571 --> 01:26:53,063
And I really think we should put
the poor kid out of his misery, don't you?

959
01:26:53,141 --> 01:26:55,507
Where is that brother of yours, anyway?

960
01:26:57,379 --> 01:27:00,314
Now, where could he be?

961
01:27:00,382 --> 01:27:02,475
In the basement?

962
01:27:03,519 --> 01:27:05,384
These heightened senses
are a kick, huh?

963
01:27:11,894 --> 01:27:14,055
No hard feelings, buddy.

964
01:27:14,129 --> 01:27:16,996
I'll make it as quick as possible.

965
01:27:27,109 --> 01:27:31,443
- Take it easy with the silver, Ellie.
- You're a monster.

966
01:27:31,513 --> 01:27:34,175
Join the club.

967
01:27:45,594 --> 01:27:47,858
That's only the beginning, Ellie.

968
01:27:49,898 --> 01:27:52,958
I should've known
you couldn't handle this.

969
01:27:54,536 --> 01:27:58,370
You're too weak to think you could
survive it. It only makes you stronger.

970
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:00,772
But you're too stupid, too timid.

971
01:28:15,591 --> 01:28:17,650
It comes and goes at first.

972
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:21,354
I probably should've told you that.

973
01:28:21,430 --> 01:28:25,161
- Unfortunately now you both have to die.
- Hey!

974
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:51,620
You'd better run, you little shit.

975
01:28:53,962 --> 01:28:56,692
I am going to kill you.

976
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:14,566
Like you said, what doesn't kill you...

977
01:31:30,418 --> 01:31:32,409
It's over.

978
01:31:33,421 --> 01:31:38,256
Are you sure?! You were a little off on
that whole 'how to break the curse' thing.

979
01:31:39,094 --> 01:31:42,257
Yeah, well, the books
kind of glossed over that part.

980
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:44,321
Uh-huh.

981
01:31:52,541 --> 01:31:54,805
We're going to be OK.

984
01:32:09,958 --> 01:32:13,450
- What are you doing here?
- Hey, Jimmy.

985
01:32:13,528 --> 01:32:17,658
I found your dog.
He was wandering the streets.

986
01:32:18,967 --> 01:32:23,131
- How'd you know where I lived?
- I told her.

987
01:32:27,275 --> 01:32:29,470
-  Are you OK?
-  Yeah, you?

988
01:32:29,544 --> 01:32:31,535
I'm good, thanks.

989
01:32:31,613 --> 01:32:32,637
Uh...

990
01:32:32,714 --> 01:32:35,547
- Can I walk you home?
- Sure.

991

- Are you coming?
- Yeah.

992

See you later.

993
01:33:05,146 --> 01:33:07,307
- Nice moves.
- It's the new me.

994
01:33:07,382 --> 01:33:12,115
I'm just gonna stay here.
And, uh... clean.
