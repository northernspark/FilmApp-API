(gas hissing)

00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:55,954
Kids, I've put your dinner
on the stove.

5
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:56,688
Okay, Mom.

6
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:58,557
Don't forget
to lock up, Chloe.

7
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,558
I won't.
Bye, Mom.

D.J.: This is 2SW, rocking you
through the '80s,

11
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,370
Freddie, you getting tired?

12
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:18,642
Just don't get any fleas
on the bed, okay?

00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,020
# I don't know why sometimes
I get frightened #

16
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:37,194
# You can see my eyes,
and tell #

17
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:40,464
# That I'm not lying #

18
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:45,368
# Look at you #

19
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,109
Mom, are you there?

20
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:17,703
Tell me, Freddie,

21
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:20,704
why do little brothers like
to freak out their sisters?

22
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:24,343
You asleep already?

23
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,078
Well, you're just gonna
have to move

24
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,846
because I need
my pillow.

25
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:30,847

00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:55,107
(knock)

31
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,643
Help! Help!

32
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:00,644
Someone help me!

33
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,181
(knocking continues)

34
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:26,636
(glass shatters)

35
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,041
Girl: No!

36
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,342
Stay away from me.

37
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,511
I mean it,
stay away from me!

38
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:35,512
I'll call
the police!

39
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,915
I mean it, you touch me
and you're gone.

40
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,990
Stay away from me!

41
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,667
Woman: Cut!

42
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:58,668
Cut it.

43
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,544
Cut it.

44
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:06,578
You idiot!

45
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,348
I told you not to go
for the throat straight away,

46
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,582
you've got to rip
her blouse off first!

47
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,417
Like in rehearsals.
Remember?

48
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,786
I forgot.

49
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:16,088
Hey, everyone,

50
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,089
Robert De Niro here forgot,
once again.

51
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,561
We're going
to call it a night.

52
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,296
You can thank
our genius Thespian here

53
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,998
for your three hours
overtime.

54
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,999
Fucking weasel.

55
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:33,005
- What's her problem?
- You, you dumb dickhead.

56
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,874
Touch my tits one more time, I'll
kick your balls in, understand?

57
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,875
Lossman?

58
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:41,079
Lossman,
where's my Coke?

59
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,181
I want my Coke
in my hand,

60
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:46,182
with ice, the second
she calls "wrap" okay?

61
00:04:57,864 --> 00:05:00,198
(knock on door)

62
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,199
Yeah?

63
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:09,107
It's you.

64
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:12,108
What do you want?

65
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:21,051
You made me look
stupid tonight,

66
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:25,123
in front of all
my friends.

67
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:27,292
No, I didn't, sweetheart.

68
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:30,293
You did that
all by yourself.

69
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,898
And I'll let you in
on a little secret:

70
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,899
you don't have
any friends.

71
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:37,869
The fact is,

72
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,571
you're replaceable
in that mask.

73
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:42,140
I could put a monkey
in that suit,

74
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:45,141
and it would do
a better job.

75
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,613
Anyway,
I've had enough.

76
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:51,614
I'm gonna speak with Jim,
and he can sort it out.

77
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:54,386
What do you mean?

78
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,922
I mean my producer
will speak with your agent

79
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:59,923
about discontinuing
your services.

80
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,594
Do you understand
that?

81
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:04,396
Oh...

82
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,465
nice touch.

83
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:09,466
For the first time,
you actually frightened me.

84
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:15,605
mine is making intelligent
family drama.

85
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:18,608
Yours is doing cheesy clown acts
in shopping malls.

86
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,547
I'm sorry, but you just can't
cut it in features.

87
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,548
Man: Hilary, look.

88
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,562
Get out of here.

89
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Take one step closer,
I'll scream.

90
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:47,036
It's hard to scream...

91
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:50,206
without a tongue.

92
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:57,046
(Hilary screaming)

93
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,017
Just put those
in the car,

94
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:02,018
I've got to go talk
to "Mein Fuehrer."

95
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,106
(knocking)

96
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:24,107
Hilary?
It's Vanessa.

97
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,710
Oh, my God!

98
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:32,182
What do you want?

99
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,152
Sex?

100
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:35,921
Do you mean you want
to have sex with me?

101
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,223
Sex?

102
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,058
Yeah, sure.

103
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:41,760
Well, okay,

104
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,761
let's go.

105
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,470
You're going to have to take
that silly mask off.

106
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,318
Vanessa...?

107
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:13,022
(buzzing)

108
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,931
So, to answer your
question, Raffy,

109
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:21,666
that's why I don't include

110
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,667
the slasher genre
in my course. Fair enough?

111
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:27,472
So, Mr. Lossman,
what happened to the film?

112
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:30,275
"Hot Blooded"?
It was never finished.

113
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,911
There's a cut work print
in the archive, I believe.

114
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:35,180
- Would it be possible to see it?
- For what purpose, Raffy?

115
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,315
We have to do
a graduation film, right?

116
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:39,351
What better project than
to finish that film?

117
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,219
It could also make
a shitload of money.

118
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,288
Are the rights
available?

119
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,524
Hester, full marks for your
entrepreneurial spirit,

120
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,425
- but I don't think so.
- Why not?

121
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:50,426
That movie was a nightmare. You
don't go playing with nightmares.

122
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:01,437
I'll see you all
next week.

123
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,376
- Should've killed Lossman, eh?
- Yeah.

124
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,386
Mr. Lossman, we were serious
about the movie.

125
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,754
So was I, Raffy.

126
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:18,755
Look, you two have more
important things to say.

127
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:22,659
Don't waste your time
doing trash.

128
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,930
Raffy: But it's not
trash.

129
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,965
A horror film
can be just as political

130
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,200
as "Priscilla"
or "The Piano."

131
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,303
Even if it's not,
what's wrong with making

132
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,772
a scary film, giving people
a bit of a fright?

133
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,640
A few years back,
a director--

134
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:38,143
a young kid out
of video clips-- did just that.

135
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:41,144
The producer hired him
to complete "Hot Blooded."

136
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,715
It was the first time the print
had been screened

137
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:46,251
since the murder
of Hilary Jacobs.

138
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,252
What happened next
is totally bizarre.

139
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:50,822
The kid was butchered,

140
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:53,525
but the police
never found the killer.

141
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:56,061
The creepy thing is,
the projectionist was the only one

142
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:58,597
with access to the screening room.
And he was cleared.

143
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,598
You're saying there's some sort
of curse on this film?

144
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:04,436
I'm saying this is something
best left alone.

145
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,172
- Thought is deed.
- What do you mean?

146
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,773
You read Eastern
philosophy,

147
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,774
the ancients say that
what you think, you create.

148
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,412
"Hot Blooded" was a loathsome
piece of shit

149
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:16,581
that never should've been made
in the first place.

150
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:19,582
So what's the story
with the producer?

151
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:21,686
He tried to finish
the film

152
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,221
so that he could save
his investment.

153
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,156
One night while he was
in the editing room,

154
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,158
he was electrocuted.

155
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,693
Raffy: It was an accident.
Accidents happen.

156
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:30,195
Look,
I'm not superstitious,

157
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:32,931
and I don't believe in curses
or what-have-you.

158
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,000
Listen, you kids
have a gift.

159
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,835
Don't waste
your combined talents

160
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:39,836
on this ugly
piece of shit.

161
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,341
So what do
you think?

162
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:45,377
I think it'd be cool.
Let's do it.

163
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,378
Yeah!

164
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:49,379
(modem crackling)

165
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:19,878
I can get the rights
for next to nothing.

166
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,313
I just spoke
to the producer's wife--

167
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:23,581
or should I say
his widow.

168
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:26,117
Get this, she said
she's prepared

169
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:29,118
to put in some money
to see it finished.

170
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:31,823
What's the story
with casting?

171
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,958
The girl
who played the sister,

172
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,761
her name's Vanessa Turnbill
and she lives in L.A.,

173
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:38,563
and she's done
a couple of B-grade movies,

174
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:41,166
she's doing a daytime soap
at the moment, so,

175
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,400
I think we can
get her.

176
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:43,635
I can market that.

177
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:44,836
Um, hi.

178
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:47,837
What about all these people
who keep, sort of, dying

179
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:49,941
trying to make
this film?

180
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:52,942
Are you gonna market that,
do you think, Miss Producer?

181
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:54,179
Probably.

182
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,082
Yeah?
That's promising.

183
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,818
So, who's in?

184
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:02,787
Who wants to make
a mainstream slasher movie?

185
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,389
Bigger than "Halloween."

186
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,225
Creepier than
"Friday the 13th."

187
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:10,226
More blood and guts
than "Texas Chainsaw Massacre."

188
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,597
More sex
than "Deep Throat."

189
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:14,499
You're so bad.

190
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,500
It's time we graduated
into pop culture, boys and girls.

191
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:19,771
So what say you?
Who's in?

192
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:20,772
- Yes.
- What the hell?

193
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,140
Yep.

194
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:25,141
Yes.

195
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,401
It's a lousy deal.

196
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:51,870
Unbelievably lousy,

197
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:54,871
- but I see some merit in it.
- What kind of merit?

198
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:56,908
I done some checking.

199
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:59,244
Word around town is they're
the next big thing,

200
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,479
particularly the director,
this kid called Raffy.

201
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,882
They say she's the next
Jane Campion.

202
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:06,883
Listen, this could be the next hit
at Sundance, this kind of movie.

203
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,320
Look what "Scream" did
for Courtney Cox.

204
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,289
Give me a break.
She was a millionaire already.

205
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,258
I just don't know
if I can do it, Jerry.

206
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,193
It's gonna dredge up
all kinds of old shit.

207
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:18,194
Besides, there's a celebrity golf
tournament in Las Vegas next week.

208
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:21,497
Nessie, baby, I'll be able
to work the bejesus out of this.

209
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:22,867
Are you kidding me?

210
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:25,868
"Slasher movie gone horribly
wrong, buried for years.

211
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:29,438
Vanessa Turnbill goes back
to face her demons."

212
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,110
You can't buy publicity
like this.

213
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,212
E!, Entertainment Tonight,

214
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,881
Access Hollywood--
they'll go crazy.

215
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:39,882
Sweetheart, I don't want to be
reading the trades one morning,

216
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,755
see this movie grossing $100 mil
and you are not a part of it.

217
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:46,756
Do you and me a favor,
fly coach to Australia.

218
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,294
Oh! Hey!

219
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:52,295
Coach!?

220
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:09,245
(horn honking)

221
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:16,886
(car stereo blasting)

222
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,123
Hi.
Vanessa?

223
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,492
I'm Raffy,
I'm the director.

224
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:22,727
This is Hester.
She's the producer.

225
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:25,728
Sorry we're late.
We ran out of petrol.

226
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,965
I'll help you
with these.

227
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,805
We've got a press conference
in an hour.

228
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,173
Would you like
to freshen up?

229
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:38,174
Am I booked into a hotel,
or sleeping at your house?

230
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:42,614
Miss Turnbill, why have you
come back to finish the movie?

231
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:45,615
It's extremely rare that you find
really good parts for women.

232
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,785
When I find one
I just jump at the chance.

233
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:49,854
Miss Turnbill, Holly Jones,
reporting live, Channel 5,

234
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,389
are you worried
about the curse?

235
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,323
What curse?

236
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,826
Every time there's an attempt
to finish this film, someone dies.

237
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,494
Oh, there's a special clause
in my contract.

238
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,096
If I die,
I get paid extra.

239
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,965
Aren't you concerned that it will
bring back bad memories,

240
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:02,333
Miss Turnbill,
doing this film?

241
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:05,334
All of that happened a long time ago.
I've put all that behind me.

242
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,639
It's wonderful
to be back in Australia.

243
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,108
Anyway, I would have killed
these two if they'd left me out.

244
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:13,109
I only just arrived,
so if you'll excuse me?

245
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:18,449
Thank you very much.
That will be all.

246
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,151
I've got to get some sleep.
Can you take me to the hotel?

247
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:23,152
Your room won't be ready till 2:00.
They're still cleaning.

248
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:27,056
You want a coffee?

249
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:35,798
Raffy: Her husband must have
done well out of slasher films.

250
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:39,902
I'll be frank with you.

251
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,973
The only reason
I'm doing this,

252
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:44,974
is because I need
the money.

253
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:49,245
My late husband and I have
a first dollar gross position,

254
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,815
which means nothing

255
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:53,816
unless the film is finished
and on-sold.

256
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:57,553
Hopefully this will be
my little nest egg.

257
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,658
- Sign that.
- What is it?

258
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,360
It's an indemnity.

259
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:03,294
From now on,

260
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,763
I'm not responsible
for anything that happens.

261
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:08,764
It's on your heads.

262
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:19,342
It's called
"blood money," girls.

263
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,979
Blood money.

264
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,253
- Hi, Bobby.
- Oh, hi.

265
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:30,922
You doing this movie?

266
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:33,923
Oh, yeah. The production
for "Mad Max 4"

267
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:37,893
got pushed back a few weeks,
so I got a window.

268
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:39,831
Cool.

269
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,467
Let's meet up later,
and go over the make-up.

270
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:45,468
Yeah, sure.

271
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,941
Isn't this where that guy
got murdered?

272
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:51,642
You know,
watching this same print?

273
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:53,044
What guy?

274
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,946
Hey, guys,
got a second?

275
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,280
You remember
a couple days ago,

276
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:59,281
we were talking about
the possibility...

277
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:03,419
Jesus Christ, has somebody
been smoking in here?

278
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,125
I heard she always gets off
with her co-star.

279
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:13,498
What about when she did
that TV remake of "Lassie"?

280
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:14,465
(laughs)

281
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,634
Haven't you ever heard
of secondhand smoke?

282
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:19,635
Hi, I'm Bobby Doog.
I'm your co-star.

283
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:23,572
I'm playing Scarman,
psycho-killer guy.

284
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,710
Good casting.

285
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,711
(group snickering)

286
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:40,222
Hello? Hi.

287
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,396
"Hot Blooded"?

288
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,166
Oh, daddy.
Not these cans again.

289
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,968
I thought they'd been destroyed.
You Raffy Carruthers?

290
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:52,603
- Yeah.
- Loved your short.

291
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,405
Bloody brilliant.
Except that last shot

292
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,140
was straight out
of "Shock Corridor,"

293
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,909
you derivative
little thing, you.

294
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,777
I've written a screenplay.
You want to read it?

295
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:02,447
- You seen this?
- Yeah, screened it once.

296
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,115
Best thing the director
ever did.

297
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:06,951
Bit of a hack,
she was, you know.

298
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:09,952
Or should I say she was
a bit "hacked."

299
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,924
Last time I screened this,
a kid sat out in the front,

300
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,460
got his throat slit
by some psycho cleaner.

301
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:18,461
It's a funny thing, I seen
so many murders on the screen,

302
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,831
you see the real thing,
hey, it's no big deal.

303
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:24,769
You get these
gender specific assholes

304
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,637
that think that
screen violence

305
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,706
is going to turn us all
into mass murderers.

306
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:29,607
Well, it's crap.

307
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,608
I've seen hundreds of murders.
I've seen thousands of murders.

308
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:35,513
Next time somebody
goes into McDonald's,

309
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,248
shoots up 20 people
with a Uzi

310
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,917
and they find a Steven Seagal
video in his back pocket,

311
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:42,918
you know what they ought to do?
Ring "60 Minutes," and get them

312
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:46,088
to do one of their checkbook
bullshit journalism stories on me,

313
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,692
because I'm a walking
advertisement

314
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:50,661
for liberalizing
X-rated everything.

315
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:53,662
You know what I mean?
Art is art, eh?

316
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:00,836
Okay, everyone,
let the horror begin.

317
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,108
(laughs menacingly)

318
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:07,109
- Shut up, Rick.
- What?

319
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,831
Kids, I've put your dinner
on the stove.

320
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,067
Okay, Mom.

321
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:33,068
Don't forget
to lock up, Chloe.

322
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:42,513
Freddie.

323
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,514
(cat meows)

324
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:56,425
(hissing)

325
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,633
What's wrong?

326
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:05,634
I thought
I heard something.

327
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,125
You asleep already?

328
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:29,860
Well, you're just going
to have to move--

329
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:32,861
Augh!

330
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:39,335
(telephone rings)

331
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:44,675
Hello?

332
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:47,676
Now you die!

333
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:06,629
Stay away from me!

334
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:09,767
Hilary: Cut! Cut!

335
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,270
Cut!

336
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,572
That was her voice.

337
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:16,140
Did you hear
her voice?

338
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:17,675
Hes?

339
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,543
Hes, wake up.

340
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:22,544
(screaming)

341
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:35,758
Oh, God!

342
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:37,328
Bobby...

343
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:38,529
that's enough.

344
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,530
It's cruel.

345
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,200
(laughter)

346
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:50,775
- Bobby: Did I pass the audition?
- With flying colors, sir.

347
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,076
I did the make-up.

348
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,245
Not bad for a quickie
in the dark, eh, Raff?

349
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:56,280
That's your specialty, isn't it?
Quickies in the dark?

350
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:59,016
- You're a retard, Paulie.
- I didn't buy into it, Raff.

351
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:02,017
You're all a bunch
of fuck wits.

352
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:03,888
Come on,

353
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:06,889
bus leaves at 7:00 a.m. sharp.
Check your gear, please.

354
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:09,925
- Paulie: I didn't mean to do it.
- Fuck off, Paulie. Grow up.

355
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,799
Bobby: Don't think I went
too far, do you?

356
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,504
Hello?

357
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:27,209
Hello...?

358
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,708
Our star isn't traveling
with us, then?

359
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:58,909
- Vanessa?
- Yeah.

360
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,345
- No, we sprung for a driver.
- Of course.

361
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:04,346
- Has anyone seen Raff?
- Everyone off the bus!

362
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,784
How are we supposed
to make this film

363
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,018
without our famous director?

364
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,421
Maybe Damien could take over,
like he did in the short.

365
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:12,289
Shut up, Paulie,
that's bullshit and you know it.

366
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:15,290
We were there. You're not talking
to the cinema papers now.

367
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:19,261
(Paulie laughs)

368
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:23,367
Raff, I'm sorry.

369
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:26,368
We're all sorry.
It was meant to be a joke.

370
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:44,422
Did you pick up
the print?

371
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,590
Yeah, it's in back.

372
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,292
Raffy: Guess we broke
the curse, huh?

373
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:50,728
We screened it without anyone
getting killed.

374
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:53,729
Yeah, I guess.

375
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:11,649
You've done well,
Nessie.

376
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,117
But I knew you would.

377
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,152
And I always knew
you'd end up teaching.

378
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:17,588
(chuckling)

379
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:20,589
Hey, you got any Diet Coke
in here?

380
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,740
Thank you.

381
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:41,545
Number 6.

382
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:43,814
This is the place.

383
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,216
What place?

384
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:48,118
Where Cassie and I are finally
going to consummate

385
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,353
our blossoming
relationship.

386
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:51,055
(laughs loudly)

387
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:53,324
Aw, in your wet dreams,
buddy.

388
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,925
She's got her eye
on Damien.

389
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:57,194
Yeah, but Damien's
got a thing for Raffy.

390
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:59,997
Hand off it, now.
Raffy's got the hots for Bobby.

391
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,533
No way! Bobby's got a thing
for Jules.

392
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:04,568
Jules is porking Jim.

393
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:07,569
Jules and Jim, are you serious?
I thought Jim was porking Hester.

394
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,374
Hester's a dyke,
you dork.

395
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:12,209
Plus she's got the hots
for Raffy.

396
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,444
What about Raffy
and Bobby?

397
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,813
Well, Raffy and Bobby
is unrequited, so far.

398
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:18,814
But Raffy has shown
an interest in... moi.

399
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:20,885
- You?
- Yeah.

400
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:22,453
Was she shitfaced?

401
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:25,322
One of these days you're going
to implode with envy,

402
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:27,324
you poor, pathetic,
little creature.

403
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:29,093
Hey, I can't help that
I'm endowed

404
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:30,928
like that guy out
of "Boogie Nights."

405
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:33,929
What, with a fake dick?

406
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:38,269
They're got
to be kidding.

407
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,571
It's only
for a few days.

408
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:43,572
This bed's got bugs in it.
I can tell by looking at it.

409
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:51,146
If I spend one night on this thing,
I'm gonna need a masseuse.

410
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:54,118
I did a course
in reiki.

411
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:56,954
Reiki?

412
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:59,955
No shit?

413
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:21,843
Rick: So this is the house
of horrors.

414
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:46,670
Man: Watch your feet!

415
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:49,671
I don't want mud
everywhere.

416
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,276
Are you going to put
something down?

417
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,845
I don't want a herd of elephants
tramping dirt through here.

418
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:57,014
Yes, Mr. Drivett,
we'll be really careful,

419
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:59,249
I'll make sure they treat it
like it was my own house.

420
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,685
That's no comfort to me.
You look like you'd live in a dump.

421
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:02,519
Hey, hey!

422
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,588
Put that down, son,
that's bone china!

423
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:05,889
From China.

424
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,890
Really?
I thought it was from bone.

425
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:11,929
Now, the rules
are these:

426
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,698
no drugs,
no loud music,

427
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,634
no eating or drinking
in the house.

428
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,302
I've disconnected
the phone,

429
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,204
so you can't make
any personal calls.

430
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:22,206
Can I ask
one small favor?

431
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,174
Well, you can
certainly ask.

432
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:26,810
We have the original print
of the film in the bus outside.

433
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:29,811
I was wondering if we could put it
in a safe place inside the house?

434
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,715
Certainly,
young lady.

435
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:34,618
You can keep it upstairs
in my bedroom.

436
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,787
It'll be safe there.

437
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:38,722
Now you,
come with me.

438
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:40,758
I want to talk
about the location fees.

439
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,192
Rick: I want to check out
the kitchen, too.

440
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:44,428
We've got some shots
in there. Oi!

441
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:45,829
- Rick!
- Cassie!

442
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,864
(smashing)

443
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:49,767
Cassie!
You've deboned the china.

444
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:52,403
You're a moron,
Rick.

445
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:53,704
I hate you.

446
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:55,105
Somehow, I doubt that.

447
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:57,474
Rick, next time you do
something like that,

448
00:27:57,475 --> 00:27:58,676
you two
can go home.

449
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,310
- Promise?
- Yes.

450
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:03,311
I didn't do it.

451
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:16,224
Where the hell is our
expensive import?

452
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,862
Oh, great, no signal.

453
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,863
Bad luck, huh?

454
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,804
Raffy: That must have been
where she was murdered.

455
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:27,638
Hester: Who?

456
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:30,074
Hilary Jacobs,
the director.

457
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:31,975
They said it was
a Swiss chalet.

458
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:33,544
It always sounded
so weird.

459
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,545
Who said?

460
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:44,286
Can't use your phone, huh?
How will you cope?

461
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:53,664
Okay, everybody,

462
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:56,665
can I just have a few seconds
of your time, please?

463
00:28:57,635 --> 00:28:59,770
Okay everyone, come on.
Shh-shh.

464
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:02,771
Okay, the back story
goes something like this:

465
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:05,476
when they were kids,
their parents went out

466
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:08,477
left them on their own,
and the house caught on fire.

467
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:11,513
Now, Charlie got horribly burned
and scarred for life,

468
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:15,083
but his beautiful sister,
Chloe, got out unscathed.

469
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,854
Now he hates her
for that,

470
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:19,656
and he hates his mom and dad
for doing this to him.

471
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:22,657
His dad is the first to go,
he went in reel two.

472
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:25,095
Then an assorted range
of victims,

473
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,096
until we get
to reel nine,

474
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:29,097
which is where the film stopped
as he kills his sister.

475
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:31,235
Now, the scenes
we're about to film

476
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:33,103
are where the mother
gets killed,

477
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,572
who will be played
by Vanessa.

478
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:37,641
And this is the climax
of the film,

479
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:39,777
so I don't need to tell you
how important it is.

480
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,778
Now, does anybody
have any questions?

481
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:47,048
Do they sell any tofu
around here?

482
00:29:57,495 --> 00:30:00,495
(sniffs)

483
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:10,372
Scare you?

484
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:12,543
Hurt you?

485
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:15,544
(groaning)

486
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:24,352
Julie: Are you ready,
Bobby?

487
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:27,391
Okay.

488
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:28,992
If you grab the front part
of that,

489
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,928
just get that on.

490
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:33,497
Great.

491
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:36,233
How does that feel?
Can you breathe? Yup.

492
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:39,234
Just make sure that's
fine there in the collar.

493
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,039
Bobby: Stupid.

494
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,841
You all right,
Bobby?

495
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,842
Here, let's get this
fixed up.

496
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:50,581
I'll just pop the collar
underneath there.

497
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:53,582
Bobby: All right!

498
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:57,018
"Now you die."

499
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:15,337
Bobby, you--!

500
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:19,543
Why don't you practice
your method bullshit

501
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:22,544
on someone else, mate?
Dickhead!

502
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:25,949
Just go back to your Winnebago
and act like a tree.

503
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,950
Must be the un-scariest villain
I've ever seen.

504
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:33,690
Bloody actors with some
spare time on their hands.

505
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:36,159
What's he doing
watching me piss, anyway?

506
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,695
Wouldn't he prefer
a Polaroid?

507
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:41,696
Dickhead.

508
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,134
(engine revving)

509
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:46,403
Raffy: Vanessa, keep your foot
off the brake.

510
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,838
Don't accelerate
too much.

511
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:50,374
Slower, Jimmy, slower.
Take your timing from the car.

512
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,943
It changes every take,
'cause the bimbo can't drive.

513
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:55,612
Nobody told me I had to drive
a goddamn car!

514
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:57,915
And the steering wheel's
on the wrong side.

515
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,183
It really affected you,
didn't it?

516
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:03,120
The killing?

517
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:04,855
Yes, it did.

518
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,156
You know...

519
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:08,458
horror movies aren't that bad,
Mr. Lossman.

520
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:09,760
You think about it,

521
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,162
they can be cathartic
for young kids.

522
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:13,764
I mean...

523
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,933
it's all about letting go
of your fear.

524
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,367
How do you mean?

525
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:20,368
Well, you go to the movies
and there's a psycho killer

526
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,739
out in the bush,
woodchipping people,

527
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,775
suddenly, the things
you're scared of

528
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,977
don't seem so important
anymore--

529
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:29,978
like the craters on your face,
the size of your ass,

530
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,516
or will that cute guy
ask you out.

531
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:34,184
That sort of stuff.

532
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:37,185
Horror movies put that
into perspective.

533
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:40,390
When you think
about it like that,

534
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:43,391
they've actually got kind
of a social value.

535
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:49,698
- I'm in character.
- Bobby!

536
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:53,501
Excuse me.

537
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:56,504
- Raffy: Cut it! Cut it!
- Vanessa: I need a stunt driver.

538
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:32,976
Detective:
What have you got?

539
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:35,977
Time of death,
28 hours ago, plus or minus.

540
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:39,748
Deceased was part-time, single,
no one noticed him missing.

541
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:43,687
Weapon appears to be
a single blade,

542
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,156
about 30 c's,
very sharp.

543
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:47,724
He was disemboweled,

544
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:50,725
like it was some sort
of ritual slaying.

545
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:54,996
Ta.

546
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:57,134
So who was last
in the theater?

547
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:58,769
A group of film school
students,

548
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,871
made a booking,
came in last night.

549
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,672
I need a stunt driver.

550
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:05,275
Vanessa, you read the script,
you knew you had to drive.

551
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:08,276
Every movie I've ever done,
I've always had a stunt driver.

552
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:11,279
Vanessa: Do you think
I'm Sly Stallone, Jackie Chan?

553
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,883
I don't do my own stunts.
Where's Lossman?

554
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:20,321
Paulie...
Paulie, please. Wait.

555
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:23,660
Cass, come on.

556
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:26,661
Paul, no, not here.

557
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:29,900
I've gotta get back.
And so do you.

558
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,102
I told Rick I had to go
back to town,

559
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:33,770
get some extra
batteries.

560
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:35,906
I told Hes
you were feeling sick,

561
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,542
had to go back
and have a lie down.

562
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:40,677
You bastard.

563
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:43,678
So we've got
all night.

564
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,099
- Cass: Bobby...?
- Bobby? Come on.

565
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:08,169
Oh, my God!

566
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:09,973
- Paulie!
- You want it.

567
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:12,476
Cassie?

568
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:13,477
No!

569
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:14,478
Bobby!

570
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:17,479
No!

571
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:22,383
Shit!
Oh, shit!

572
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:30,327
Who are you?

573
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:33,328
Bobby?
Bobby, is that you?

574
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:43,273
Get away from me!

575
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:46,274
Get away from me!

576
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,410
Get away from me!

577
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:11,766
What do you want of me?

578
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:14,869
What do you want?

579
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:18,072
What do you want?

580
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:27,817
Cut it.

581
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:29,352
Let's call it
a night,

582
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,921
everyone's tired,
we can pick up tomorrow.

583
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:33,256
Yup.

584
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:35,525
You gonna ask me to ride
a goddamn horse tomorrow?

585
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:38,526
- No, tomorrow you die.
- Oh, I can hardly wait.

586
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,264
Julie: Vanessa, can I grab
a couple Polaroids--

587
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:42,265
Fuck off!

588
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:45,266
Oh.

589
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,718
We're missing
three.

590
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:05,388
Cassie went back
sick.

591
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,090
So did my asshole
of a boomie.

592
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:08,225
Funny about that.

593
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,659
Yeah.

594
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,660
Where's Bobby?

595
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,832
Where have you been
all night?

596
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:18,235
Just doing
the method.

597
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,103
Yeah, meaning scaring
the shit out of people.

598
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:21,571
I'm still wet,
by the way.

599
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,540
What?

600
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:25,609
Oh, you fake sincerity
so well.

601
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,777
It's the secret
of good acting, mate.

602
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:30,778
- Duh.
- Duh!

603
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:43,360
Happy with what
you got?

604
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:44,861
Yeah, it was
all right.

605
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:47,862
Damien's great.

606
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:49,866
How was our star?

607
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:52,867
Well, she can play
hysterical really well.

608
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:57,474
Do you want to have
a drink tonight, before bed?

609
00:37:57,475 --> 00:38:00,475
Thanks Hes,
but I'm pretty tired.

610
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:04,445
Yeah, I understand.

611
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:07,742
Shit.

612
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:11,581
Hello?

613
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:14,582
Is someone there?

614
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:28,663
Oh--!

615
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,634
What are you
doing here?

616
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:34,635
Sorry, I thought you might want
some company.

617
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:47,350
You still
get nightmares?

618
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:49,119
Uh-huh. And you?

619
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,720
Oh, yeah.

620
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:53,721
My therapy bill at the end
of each month is huge.

621
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:58,159
Sometimes I wake up in the middle
of the night screaming.

622
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:00,597
I used to take uppers
for years

623
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:02,832
to keep from going
to sleep.

624
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:05,268
And I still can't walk
into a building late at night

625
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:08,269
without getting
the shakes.

626
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:11,372
- How about you?
- Same.

627
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,776
I remember your face,
looking at me.

628
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:19,213
I'll never forget that.

629
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:22,216
Flying in coach for 14 hours
makes you think.

630
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:26,020
Why did I do this?
Why did I come back?

631
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,224
I don't know.

632
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:30,326
I guess I just needed
to face it,

633
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:33,327
once and for all.

634
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,432
I'm scared.

635
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:41,903
- Scared of what?
- Those scenes tomorrow.

636
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:45,139
Don't worry, you'll be fine.
I'll be there.

637
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:55,518
I don't get it, Raff,
this film.

638
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:58,519
You could've done what you wanted.
Lossman thinks you're God.

639
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:01,989
Yeah, but I wanted to do
this film.

640
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:05,193
You think it's gonna set you up
as a commercial director?

641
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,430
Is that it?

642
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:10,431
No, it's not.
It's more personal than that.

643
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:14,435
What's personal
about a horror movie?

644
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,440
I've just gotta
finish this film.

645
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:39,896
Hester Ryan?

646
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:42,165
Yes.
Who are you?

647
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,400
I'm Senior Detective
Ian Hollander,

648
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:45,635
from Special Crimes
Squad

649
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:47,003
and this is
Detective Carter.

650
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:50,004
Can we have a word,
please?

651
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,040
Sure.

652
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:54,041
So did you notice anything
unusual at the theater?

653
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:57,447
Did you notice anyone strange,
hanging around the set at all?

654
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:58,681
No.

655
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:01,551
Anything unusual
that you can think of?

656
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:04,552
No one, nothing out
of the ordinary.

657
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:07,989
Raffy: I suppose you've heard
about this curse?

658
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:11,559
Miss, we know that seven years
ago, an Angelo...

659
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:13,329
- Zabriki.
- Zabriki,

660
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:16,330
was killed in that same theater,
watching the same film,

661
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:18,201
and we're investigating
the possibility

662
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:20,870
that there's a connection
between the two.

663
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,273
But at the moment,
we're investigating

664
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:24,374
as if they are
separate incidents.

665
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,976
You see, we don't think
the projectionist

666
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:29,412
was killed by a curse,
Miss Carruthers.

667
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:32,181
We believe he was killed
by one or more

668
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:35,182
very sick individuals
who are quite capable

669
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:37,320
of being apprehended
by police officers

670
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:40,321
such as ourselves.

671
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:42,659
Do you have any idea
why someone

672
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,660
would want to stop this film
from being made?

673
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:50,099
Beats me.

674
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,035
Well, if you can
think of anything,

675
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:54,170
give us a call.

676
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:55,705
And if you could give us
the details

677
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:57,907
of where you're filming,
that would be of help.

678
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,075
Sure.

679
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,044
- (knock on door)
- Yeah?

680
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:04,045
- Can I come in?
- Sure.

681
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,685
You okay?

682
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:09,686
I don't know.

683
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:12,388
I don't know
what's happening.

684
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:14,057
Look, someone
got murdered,

685
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:16,659
and it's awful
and tragic, but,

686
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,261
it has nothing
to do with us,

687
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,662
or what we're
doing here.

688
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:21,297
You believe that?

689
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:24,298
I don't know what
to believe.

690
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:27,835
What I'm worried about now
is the others.

691
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:30,239
I don't think
we should tell anyone.

692
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,908
I don't want Rick
getting spooked,

693
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:33,910
pulling a number,
stopping the shoot.

694
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:36,379
What do you think?

695
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,915
I think Paulie and Cassie
didn't come home last night.

696
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:41,651
Rick checked their beds
and they haven't been slept in.

697
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:42,785
What?

698
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,454
Do you think there's
a connection?

699
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:47,455
I don't know, but it's
a little bit creepy.

700
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:49,392
You know those two.

701
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:51,794
They probably got shitfaced,
bonked all night,

702
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,030
and fell asleep in one
of the old sheds.

703
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:56,699
Raff, this isn't life
imitating art.

704
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,101
The projectionist
got murdered;

705
00:43:58,102 --> 00:44:00,236
the fact is,
he was a wacko.

706
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:03,237
I don't believe there's some
cracked killer out there,

707
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,841
stalking us like
we were in the plot

708
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:07,477
from "Bride of Chucky 7,"
or whatever.

709
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:10,478
Life doesn't work
like that.

710
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:14,384
If Cass and Paulie
don't turn up by crew call,

711
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:16,252
I'll call the cops,
okay?

712
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:19,253
Okay.

713
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:23,393
You are brilliant,

714
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:26,394
and you're going to make
a brilliant movie.

715
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:37,972
We've just got to keep it
all on the rails.

716
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,908
Mr. Drivett?

717
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:14,909
We're back.

718
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:17,947
(dog barks)

719
00:45:17,948 --> 00:45:19,182
Mr. Drivett,

720
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:21,184
is it all right if we set up
in the living room?

721
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:23,119
Hes, have you got
a minute?

722
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,620
What's wrong?

723
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:27,621
So this is only one
we've got, yeah?

724
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:31,025
Jules, can you tell Hes
what the problem is, please?

725
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:33,563
Cassie put all of Scarman's
wardrobe here.

726
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:36,564
All the doubles, including
the masks, but they're gone.

727
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:40,269
Do you know
what happened to them?

728
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:43,270
Do you think
I nicked them?

729
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:45,208
I'll ask around.

730
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:47,410
Thanks.

731
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,712
There are no doubles
of your wardrobe,

732
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:52,281
so don't make a mess tonight,
all right?

733
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:55,282
Killing's a messy business.

734
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:01,190
Okay, Bobby.

735
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:03,726
Jim: We need to patch in
a few more lights

736
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:04,961
through those windows.

737
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:06,896
Any more, we're going
to melt the circuits.

738
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:09,098
The wiring in this place
is ancient.

739
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,867
Any chance of scoring
a generator?

740
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:12,502
We can't phone out
from here, can we?

741
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:13,936
No.

742
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:16,005
Okay.
I'll take the bus,

743
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:19,006
see if I can't find
a friendly farmer.

744
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,610
Damien: Thanks, man.

745
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:42,429
Jim: I'm heading off, man.
You'd better hop out.

746
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:47,336
Bobby,

747
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:50,337
don't give me this character
motivation bullshit.

748
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:54,141
Get your ass of this bus.
I've gotta get moving.

749
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,081
Hey!

750
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:02,082
Some of us have got
work to do.

751
00:47:07,057 --> 00:47:08,925
Bobby, man,

752
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:10,660
you're a loser.

753
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:13,661
Get out of here.

754
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:19,333
Oh, my God.

755
00:47:22,372 --> 00:47:24,307
When you come
into the living room,

756
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:25,908
you're not going to see
Scarman

757
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:28,077
standing behind the column
with his shears up.

758
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:29,011
Where's Bobby?

759
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,847
I dressed him
about an hour ago.

760
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:33,848
- Was he any good?
- Cretin.

761
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:37,651
Look, what we'll do is
we'll dolly into a two shot

762
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:40,289
and then we just push in
to a close up of Vanessa.

763
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:42,525
Close up?

764
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:45,526
Bobby.
Got your shears?

765
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:48,331
All right, move over
next to the wall here,

766
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:50,666
and you can hide behind here
and wait for her to come.

767
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:52,702
Okay, we'll do a line up
on that shot

768
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:55,703
if you go back to first positions.
Thanks, Vanessa.

769
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:58,507
Going for a rehearsal.

770
00:47:58,508 --> 00:48:01,508
Okay, and action.

771
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,314
Ow! Hey!
Get off!

772
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:08,117
What the fuck are you doing?
This is a rehearsal, not a take.

773
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:10,920
If we move in that fast,
I need lubricant for the track.

774
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:12,622
You'd have some left over
from last night,

775
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:14,590
wouldn't you, sweet cheeks?

776
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:17,591
Hey, come on, guys!
Hey, break it up!

777
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:19,629
One more line like that
and you can really go home.

778
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:21,764
Sounds lovely.

779
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:24,333
Should we just set up
for a take?

780
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:27,334
Do something about the mask.
It doesn't look right.

781
00:48:27,337 --> 00:48:30,337
How tight is this close up?
Are we talking crow's feet?

782
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:35,075
(dials cellular phone)

783
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:46,687
(distant whine)

784
00:48:52,162 --> 00:48:55,064
Hello, police?

785
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:58,065
Damn it!

786
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:01,936
(dialing)

787
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:08,208
(screaming)

788
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:20,321
(screaming)

789
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:42,376
(breathing heavily)

790
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,705
Hester: No!

791
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:19,706
(whirring)

792
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:39,161
Keep away from me!

793
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:42,162
(screaming)

794
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:01,650
(Hester screams)

795
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:04,651
Hester: No!

796
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:13,362
Is Jim back yet? I asked him
to go get a generator.

797
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:15,531
Maybe he's found a place
that sells tofu.

798
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:17,299
How the hell am I supposed
to make a film

799
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,935
when my entire crew
go walkabout?

800
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:22,936
You guys keep at it,
and I'll go find him.

801
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:45,225
Jim?

802
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:52,935
(Raffy screams)

803
00:52:52,936 --> 00:52:55,070
Sorry, I didn't mean
to frighten you.

804
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:57,873
That's all right.
I'm a bit on edge, that's all.

805
00:52:57,874 --> 00:53:00,342
I wanted to you ask you something,
away from everyone else.

806
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:02,144
Yeah?

807
00:53:02,145 --> 00:53:03,712
Why this movie?

808
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:05,948
I told you already.

809
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:07,883
It wouldn't have something to do
with your mother, would it?

810
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:10,653
- My mother?
- Hilary Jacobs?

811
00:53:10,654 --> 00:53:12,922
She was your mother, right?

812
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:15,923
Yeah, she was.

813
00:53:16,459 --> 00:53:19,459
That's why you want
to finish the film?

814
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:23,999
Everybody thought that she
was a hack director,

815
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
but she wasn't, Mr. Lossman.
She was so much more than that.

816
00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:29,538
You can tell by looking
at this film.

817
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,807
She was not a hack,
believe me.

818
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:34,710
She had to be smarter
and tougher than all of them.

819
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,711
And she was.

820
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:48,121
My God!

821
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:50,492
They've been slashed.

822
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:51,493
Who would do something
like this?

823
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:54,494
Kids, maybe, locals.
I don't know.

824
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:57,433
My car, too.

825
00:53:57,434 --> 00:53:59,735
You don't think...
that this could be...

826
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:01,503
What?

827
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:03,739
Nah, don't worry about it.

828
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:06,740
By the way,
have you been Hes?

829
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:19,253
(heavy breathing)

830
00:54:42,345 --> 00:54:45,345
Jesus Christ!

831
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:48,250
Rick--!

832
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:51,251
You had me going there
for a sec, man.

833
00:54:52,656 --> 00:54:55,656
You're going to put me
out of a job, bro'.

834
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:17,577
Bobby: I've got
one of those, too.

835
00:55:18,214 --> 00:55:21,214
Face off,
Wes Craven style.

836
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:31,725
(gasping)

837
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:35,862
Julie: I'll show you
how to shimmy.

838
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,567
That's great.

839
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:40,169
Okay, let's go for a take.

840
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,537
Can I get the cast in?

841
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:44,538
- Yeah, sure.
- Ta.

842
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:49,076
Okay, Bobby, time to do
some killing.

843
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:52,879
Come on.

844
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:03,258
Okay, Bobby, these are the shears
you're going to be using.

845
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:06,259
They're a special effects number,
so, as you can see.

846
00:56:06,629 --> 00:56:09,331
When you kill her, I want you
to stab her in the stomach,

847
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:10,999
and bring it up
into her rib cage.

848
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Hey, Vanessa?

849
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:23,946
Okay, like this:
in and up.

850
00:56:23,947 --> 00:56:25,314
That didn't hurt?

851
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:27,216
So you can do it
quite hard.

852
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:30,217
All right?

853
00:56:31,254 --> 00:56:33,255
You grope me,
you're history.

854
00:56:33,256 --> 00:56:36,256
Raffy: Any questions?

855
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:41,328
Then, we'll go for a take.

856
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:46,333
Jules, do you want
to do final checks?

857
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:50,704
You all right
with that, Rick? Damien?

858
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:58,145
(car horn honks)

859
00:56:58,615 --> 00:56:59,882
Okay,
when you're ready, Jules.

860
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:00,983
- Thanks.
- Yeah, yeah.

861
00:57:00,984 --> 00:57:03,984
Right.

862
00:57:05,155 --> 00:57:06,455
And,

863
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:08,757
roll sound.

864
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:10,058
Speed.

865
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:11,059
Mark it.

866
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:12,261
- 11, take one.
- Hold the roll.

867
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,262
(car horn honks)

868
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,464
Who the hell is that?

869
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:18,267
I'll take care of it.

870
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:21,268
Thank you.

871
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:28,041
(car horn honks)

872
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:36,685
Marta: The police have been
to see me.

873
00:57:36,686 --> 00:57:38,687
You must stop.
You must stop at once.

874
00:57:38,688 --> 00:57:39,955
What's wrong?
What's happened?

875
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:41,457
The evil is back.

876
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,892
Oh, I knew
this would happen.

877
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:46,893
Okay, stand by to shoot.

878
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:49,398
Roll sound.

879
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:50,666
Speed.

880
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:52,701
- Mark it.
- 11, take one.

881
00:57:52,702 --> 00:57:55,702
And-- action.

882
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:02,177
Ow, cut.
Can we cut?

883
00:58:02,178 --> 00:58:03,779
Cut it.
What's the problem?

884
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:06,780
This lash that's come loose.
They're gonna see it in the close up.

885
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:08,717
And that's too hard.
Can we back off?

886
00:58:08,718 --> 00:58:10,552
Julie, can you fix Vanessa's
false eyelash for her?

887
00:58:10,553 --> 00:58:13,021
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- As quick as possible.

888
00:58:13,022 --> 00:58:14,556
Thanks, and we'll go
for another one.

889
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:16,492
Where is the original print
of the film?

890
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:19,394
I don't know.
It's upstairs, I think. Why?

891
00:58:19,395 --> 00:58:20,829
Mr. Lossman,

892
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:23,365
there is a force
at work here.

893
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:25,200
It is not human,

894
00:58:25,201 --> 00:58:28,036
and it is unspeakably evil.

895
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:30,973
You must destroy
that film at once,

896
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:32,474
or you will all die.

897
00:58:32,475 --> 00:58:34,543
Okay, roll sound.

898
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:35,878
Speed.

899
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:37,045
Mark it.

900
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:40,046
Julie: 11, take two.

901
00:58:40,617 --> 00:58:43,617
And-- action.

902
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:47,356
Cut it, cut it!

903
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,558
Run! Get away from him!

904
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:51,159
Bobby, what the hell
are you doing?

905
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,328
That's not Bobby!

906
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:56,329
Come on!
Come on, quick!

907
00:58:57,934 --> 00:59:00,934
Where's Damien?

908
00:59:17,487 --> 00:59:18,954
Auuugh!

909
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:21,456
- Where's the old lady?
- She's there!

910
00:59:21,457 --> 00:59:22,491
Rick: Just leave her!
Come on, let's go!

911
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:24,560
She's got the keys,
you idiot!

912
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,561
Wait here.

913
00:59:28,097 --> 00:59:29,464
Vanessa, where are
you going?

914
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:30,465
Get in the car!

915
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:33,466
I've killed him once,
I can kill him again.

916
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:39,639
Raffy: Augh! Damien!

917
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:44,811
You know, Jules, I've never
said this before, but,

918
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:50,185
I've always found you
very attractive.

919
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:52,454
Oh, fuck off!

920
00:59:52,455 --> 00:59:55,455
Okay.

921
00:59:58,127 --> 01:00:01,127
Did you see where he went?

922
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:06,299
(stairs creak)

923
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:09,137
(distant scream)

924
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:10,138
(dog barks)

925
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:11,473
We need weapons.

926
01:00:11,474 --> 01:00:12,975
Damn it...

927
01:00:12,976 --> 01:00:15,976
I knew I should have
brought my handgun.

928
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:19,613
(radio static)

929
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:22,484
- Julie: What?
- He was just here.

930
01:00:22,485 --> 01:00:24,186
- Where?
- Just here!

931
01:00:24,187 --> 01:00:27,187
What do you mean?

932
01:00:32,996 --> 01:00:35,996
Julie: Open the doors.

933
01:00:45,675 --> 01:00:48,675
(scratch of metal)

934
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:56,551
Rick: What's he doing?

935
01:00:56,552 --> 01:00:59,552
It's petrol.

936
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:11,364
Oh, my God, he's going
to burn us alive.

937
01:01:11,634 --> 01:01:13,468
- Should we run for it?
- I can't move.

938
01:01:13,469 --> 01:01:16,469
Rick, what do you think,
should we run for it?

939
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,074
Get help, Jules.

940
01:01:19,075 --> 01:01:20,642
I can't move!

941
01:01:20,643 --> 01:01:23,643
- I can't do it, Rick!
- Help!

942
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:40,162
Julie: No!

943
01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:41,430
No!

944
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:42,364
No!

945
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:45,365
(Julie screaming)

946
01:01:53,076 --> 01:01:56,076
No! No!

947
01:01:57,447 --> 01:02:00,447
No! No!

948
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:43,022
Let's get
the son of a bitch!

949
01:03:01,711 --> 01:03:02,844
(all scream)

950
01:03:02,845 --> 01:03:04,179
Raffy, I'm sorry.

951
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:05,180
Don't go in there!

952
01:03:05,181 --> 01:03:08,181
(gasping)

953
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:11,851
Vanessa: Mr. Drivett.

954
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:18,894
Lossman: She found the body.
I think she's had a stroke.

955
01:03:18,895 --> 01:03:20,028
I've been trying
to revive her.

956
01:03:20,029 --> 01:03:22,197
Is she still alive?

957
01:03:22,198 --> 01:03:25,198
(dog barks)

958
01:03:25,368 --> 01:03:28,368
Vanessa: Not any more.
Come on, let's go.

959
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:32,939
- What are you doing?
- Why the film?

960
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:35,811
This sounds really weird,
but it sort of makes sense.

961
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:38,246
Marta believed
that we created the killer.

962
01:03:38,247 --> 01:03:39,247
How?

963
01:03:39,248 --> 01:03:40,549
He's the character
in the film.

964
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:43,518
The only way to destroy him
is to destroy the film.

965
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:45,654
- He's not even human?
- I don't think so.

966
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:48,223
He's the sum total
of all the creative energy

967
01:03:48,224 --> 01:03:49,591
that's gone into the film.

968
01:03:49,592 --> 01:03:52,561
There was no creative energy
that went into that piece of shit.

969
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:55,562
I've got the keys, come on.

970
01:03:58,201 --> 01:04:01,201
(outcries)

971
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:04,806
You all right?

972
01:04:04,807 --> 01:04:07,309
Yeah.

973
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:10,310
Let's burn these bastards.

974
01:04:12,915 --> 01:04:15,915
Mr. Lossman, behind you!

975
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:28,630
Raffy: Oh, my God.

976
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:30,432
Hey, ugly!

977
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:31,833
It's me you want, isn't it?

978
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:34,834
I'm the one that killed you.

979
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:37,572
You're disgusting.

980
01:04:37,573 --> 01:04:40,573
You make me want
to vomit.

981
01:04:40,843 --> 01:04:42,844
Come on, Mr. Movie Star,
do you want to kill me?

982
01:04:42,845 --> 01:04:44,679
Huh?

983
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:47,680
Come on...
let's go!

984
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:13,406
Well, this must be
the place.

985
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:32,025
(banging)

986
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:38,934
You stay away from me.

987
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:41,636
Oh, shit.
Is that the girl?

988
01:05:41,637 --> 01:05:42,737
It sure is.

989
01:05:42,738 --> 01:05:45,738
BK 35 to Central.
Come in Central.

990
01:05:56,986 --> 01:05:59,986
Scarman: Arrgh!

991
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:08,461
Hey, girlie!
Get away from there.

992
01:06:09,098 --> 01:06:10,165
Leave me alone!

993
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:11,166
Hey, hey, hey!

994
01:06:11,167 --> 01:06:12,400
No, don't! Please!

995
01:06:12,401 --> 01:06:15,401
Arrgh!

996
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:24,546
You take care of her.
I'll go check inside.

997
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:27,415
Calm down.

998
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:30,416
No, you don't understand,
it's evil!

999
01:06:42,565 --> 01:06:45,565
Auuugh!

1000
01:06:46,135 --> 01:06:49,135
Hold it right there!

1001
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:54,140
I said,
hold it right there!

1002
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:58,678
I said--

1003
01:06:58,714 --> 01:07:01,714
(yelling)

1004
01:07:05,121 --> 01:07:07,255
Don't move.

1005
01:07:07,256 --> 01:07:10,256
I've done nothing
wrong, officer.

1006
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:14,060
I'm just a simple shopkeeper
from Crompton,

1007
01:07:14,897 --> 01:07:17,365
here on holidays
with my family.

1008
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:19,300
Get in the car.
Everything's all right.

1009
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:20,402
You don't understand!

1010
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:23,004
Put down the knife.

1011
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:26,005
It's not a knife.
It's only a pair of garden shears,

1012
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:29,675
simply modified so I can do
interesting things, like,

1013
01:07:31,947 --> 01:07:33,681
cut off heads.

1014
01:07:33,682 --> 01:07:36,682
Just drop it!

1015
01:07:40,956 --> 01:07:42,390
(guttural laugh)

1016
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:45,391
Oh, shit!

1017
01:07:46,429 --> 01:07:49,429
The magic of movies.

1018
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:09,217
Don't move.

1019
01:08:09,218 --> 01:08:10,919
- Please, please.
- Stay calm.

1020
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,920
Stay calm,
I'll be back soon.

1021
01:08:56,332 --> 01:08:59,332
Don't you just hate that?

1022
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:07,675
I don't know who you are,

1023
01:09:07,676 --> 01:09:09,878
but you better let go
of me right now.

1024
01:09:09,879 --> 01:09:11,913
Or else what?
You'll lock me up?

1025
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:14,914
(yelping)

1026
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,121
I'm something special, huh?

1027
01:09:20,122 --> 01:09:21,990
Let me out!

1028
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:24,991
Scoot.

1029
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:45,711
(sighing)

1030
01:10:49,878 --> 01:10:52,878
Now, where were we?

1031
01:11:36,258 --> 01:11:39,258
No!

1032
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:45,965
No...!

1033
01:12:01,216 --> 01:12:04,216
(screaming)

1034
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:10,191
No! No!

1035
01:12:10,192 --> 01:12:13,192
No, no, don't!

1036
01:12:18,367 --> 01:12:21,367
Please, don't!

1037
01:12:29,211 --> 01:12:32,211
Yeah!

1038
01:12:43,892 --> 01:12:46,027
Die, you bastard!

1039
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:49,028
(screaming)

1040
01:12:56,238 --> 01:12:59,238
Die!

1041
01:13:33,142 --> 01:13:36,142
Come on, what's wrong?
You a bit tired, huh?

1042
01:13:39,648 --> 01:13:42,648
Not feeling so good, eh?
Come on!

1043
01:13:43,719 --> 01:13:46,719
You're finished, you B-grade
piece of shit.

1044
01:14:08,177 --> 01:14:11,177
(wailing)

1045
01:15:23,919 --> 01:15:26,053
Hey...

1046
01:15:26,054 --> 01:15:29,054
Hey...

1047
01:15:46,441 --> 01:15:49,441
(raspy voiced)
It's down here.

1048
01:15:49,745 --> 01:15:52,745
Did you see that?

1049
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:04,191
- Hey, Vanessa, how are you?
- Hi, Vanessa.

1050
01:16:04,192 --> 01:16:06,494
- Hi, hi.
- You're looking much better.

1051
01:16:06,495 --> 01:16:07,795
Oh, thanks.

1052
01:16:07,796 --> 01:16:10,796
- Ow, ow.
- Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

1053
01:16:12,267 --> 01:16:13,801
So you're sure he's dead?

1054
01:16:13,802 --> 01:16:14,869
He only existed

1055
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:16,671
within the context
of the film.

1056
01:16:16,672 --> 01:16:19,574
When that was destroyed,
so was he.

1057
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:21,409
Thank God.

1058
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:24,410
Maybe now I can sleep
at night.

1059
01:16:39,361 --> 01:16:41,162
Woman: We are so lucky today.

1060
01:16:41,163 --> 01:16:43,531
We're lucky because
we're here to see

1061
01:16:43,532 --> 01:16:46,532
the most exciting screening
of a very rare film.

1062
01:16:47,102 --> 01:16:49,403
You may have read about it
in the newspapers,

1063
01:16:49,404 --> 01:16:52,340
because there was
this so-called

1064
01:16:52,341 --> 01:16:54,475
"curse" on the film.

1065
01:16:54,476 --> 01:16:56,978
And that was that
every time anybody tried

1066
01:16:56,979 --> 01:16:59,914
to complete the film,
someone died.

1067
01:16:59,915 --> 01:17:02,915
In any case, this print
is the only print in existence,

1068
01:17:04,653 --> 01:17:07,653
and we are really lucky
to be able to see it today.

1069
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:09,890
All right,
nothing more to say.

1070
01:17:09,891 --> 01:17:12,126
Here we go,
let's roll it.

1071
01:17:12,127 --> 01:17:15,127
(applause)

1072
01:18:24,332 --> 01:18:26,067
# I sense inside #

1073
01:18:26,068 --> 01:18:27,968
# The need to wrest #

1074
01:18:27,969 --> 01:18:29,737
# Those gripping claws #

1075
01:18:29,738 --> 01:18:31,772
# within my chest #

1076
01:18:31,773 --> 01:18:33,674
# A bad desire #

1077
01:18:33,675 --> 01:18:35,609
# Slipping in #

1078
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:37,178
# I pray at night #

1079
01:18:37,179 --> 01:18:39,080
# Forgive my sin #

1080
01:18:39,081 --> 01:18:42,081
# No wonder I can't sleep
at night #

1081
01:18:42,784 --> 01:18:45,784
# No wonder I can't
sleep at night #

1082
01:18:46,288 --> 01:18:49,288
# No wonder I can't sleep
at night #

1083
01:18:49,991 --> 01:18:52,991
# No wonder I can't
sleep at night #

1084
01:18:53,962 --> 01:18:55,796
# I hold my head #

1085
01:18:55,797 --> 01:18:57,565
# I'm heading down #

1086
01:18:57,566 --> 01:18:59,533
# Toward the dark #

1087
01:18:59,534 --> 01:19:01,202
# Beneath the ground #

1088
01:19:01,203 --> 01:19:03,037
# I feel the presence #

1089
01:19:03,038 --> 01:19:04,939
# Of the dead #

1090
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:06,707
# They come to life #

1091
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:08,275
# Inside of me #

1092
01:19:08,276 --> 01:19:11,276
# No wonder I can't sleep
at night #

1093
01:19:12,305 --> 01:19:18,268
