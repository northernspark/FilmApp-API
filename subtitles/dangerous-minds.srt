00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,780
<i>I was beginning to like the puta.!</i>

147
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,580
Ohh! No, no, no. Everybody,
everybody. Emilio ate her.

148
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,540
Bullshit.

149
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,500
- That bitch was too ugly to eat.
- Yeah!

150
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,980
Fed her to my dogs.

151
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,420
But I'll eat you.

152
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,540
What is your name?

153
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,220
Emilio Ramirez.

154
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:54,340
- Now, Emilio!
- Emilio, you in trouble!

155
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,300
Emilio! Emilio! Emilio! Emilio! Emilio!

156
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,380
- Emilio! Emilio! Emilio! Emilio!
- Oh, my God. - What's that?

157
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,300
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come
on. You know what they're like. Come on.

158
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:15,180
Emilio! Emilio! Emilio! Emilio!
Emilio! Emilio! Emilio! Emilio!

159
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,780
Madison surrendered to the nationalists.

160
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:41,220
Hamilton himself could have already have
composed the message that embraced...

161
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,060
Donna. Donna, take over the class.

162
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,540
Shut up!

163
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,100
What happened to Miss Shepherd?

164
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,380
- Well, she quit.
- Why?

165
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,540
Well, she was a very
high-strung individual.

166
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,540
What, did she have a breakdown?

167
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,820
No. She quit before that.

168
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,260
One of the substitutes,
she had a breakdown.

169
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,820
- That's how they weed them out.
- Who are these kids, rejects from hell?

170
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:24,180
No. They're bright kids with
little or no educational skills...

171
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,260
and what we politely call
a lot of social problems.

172
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,220
Damn it, Griffith,
you could've warned me!

173
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,260
Hey, Louanne, you said
you wanted to teach.

174
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,260
- Now, is that a load of bull or what?
- No!

175
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,740
- So teach. -
I ca... - What?

176
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,100
I can't teach them!

177
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:43,420
Yes, you can. All you gotta
do is get their attention.

178
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,100
Or quit.

179
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,300
I'm back!

180
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:25,700
"She decided that if Brian broke a rule
she would utilize these consequences:

206

- Karate, you stupid asshole.

207
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,580
- You're so stupid. - You're
a Marine? A for-real Marine?

<i>- Discharged, but yes.

I'll try some karate
with you, Miss Johnson.

210
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:34,460
I'm sorry, but I'm not
allowed to touch a student.

211
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,860
But if you really think you know
what you're doin', come on up here.

212
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,860
<i>Hey, sounds like a challenge to
me, ése. You'd better get up there.</i>

213
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,860
Oh, I know what I'm doin'. There's no
sense doin' it though if you can't touch me.

214
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,860
Okay, anybody else know
any karate? What about you?

215
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,220
- Durrell Chang Chang.
- I know some motherfuckin' karate.

Whoo! Durrell, gimme it!

217
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,860
- Durrell.
- Shit.

218
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:06,300
- What about you? You know any karate?
- Raul. Yeah, I know enough.

Come on up here.

221
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,100

222
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,900
<i>Shit. All right. Come on, let's go, ése.</i>

223
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,460
Let's go.

224
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,900
Shit!

225
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,180
You guys... Wait, wait, wait. Whoa!

226
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,380
You guys don't know shit.

227
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,980
- "I don't know shit," man. I know what I'm doin', lady.
- You don't even know any throws.

228
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:43,420
Now, I heard that a Marine can kill a man
with his, uh, bare hands. Is that true?

229
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,620
Absolutely.

230
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,700
Oh, shit.

231
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,780
Okay, h-here's how it starts.

232
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,380
Um, okay, where's a... Can you two
move that desk down there a little bit?

233
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,140
Um, okay, everything
is slow motion at first.

234
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,860
- Um, Durrell.
- Yeah.

235
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:11,740
Okay, you, um, you move into
Raul like you're gonna hit him.

236
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,700
Yeah, I can do that.

237
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,100
- Okay.
- Nacho.

238
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:19,100
Now, Raul, you're gonna
step into Durrell...

239
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,900
and you're gonna grab his wrist, okay?

240
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:27,860
You're gonna turn your body away from him
so that your butt is in his stomach. Okay?

241
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:31,100
Fuck you! Get the fuck off me, man!

242
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,740
What you gonna do?

243
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,180
- Man, you wish, homes! You wish, man!
- Bring it on, homes!

244
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,660
- Fuck you! Get your hands off me! -
Bring it on, Nacho. - You wish, man!

245
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:42,220
- Bring it on.
- Now, it's a hip throw. It's a hip throw.

246
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,740
- Okay, take your fighting stance again, okay.
- Nacho.

247
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,900
Okay, grab his wrist. Okay.

248
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,100
Now, now this time, as you move in,

249
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,620
you're gonna take this hand, you're
gonna grab onto this shoulder.

250
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,540
Okay? Ready?

251
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,660
Oh, shit!

252
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,500
Thank you! Hey! Hey! All right!

253
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,660
<i>- Ow, man! I'll kick your motherfuckin' ass, ése.!
- Sucker! Sucker!</i>

254
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,900
Well, that was "A" work.

255
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,860
You'd make good Marines.

256
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,340
In fact, from this moment,

257
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,980
each one of you is like an inductee...

258
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,260
- Who's a duck? - With
a clean record. - Quack.

259
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:33,220
- So, if you wanna pass,
- Quack quack.

260
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,140
All you have to do is try.

261
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,900
Oh, homes.

262
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,220
Because at this point,
everyone has an "A."

263
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,700
- What?
- Is she serious?

264
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,900
But it's up to you to keep it.

265
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:01,180
- Bullshit.
- Yo, why don't you shut up, man.

266
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,660
What if it ain't bullshit? Ain't
never had no fuckin' "A" before.

267
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,540
<i>I once knew a man who couldn't read</i>

268
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,700

'cause I graduated twice</i>

help to prepare for a test</i>

272
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,740
<i>It was stress 'cause Pops
didn't achieve any academics</i>

<i>And true, indeed This
problem is an epidemic</i>

274
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,300
<i>Who want to work five long hard
days through it and get taxed</i>

Morning.

281
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,780
- Okay, today we are going to
conjugate some verbs. - What? - What?

282
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,860
Hey, what about karate?

283
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,820
Well, I can't just teach you karate.
I'll show you another hold next week.

284
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,540
Get outta here!

285
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,460
Belt it out, too. I wanna hear it.

286
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,860
We eat green beans for
dinner. What you do with 'em?

287
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,940
"We eat green beans for dinner."

288
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,740

Hey, man, it's not a big deal, okay?

292
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,220
Is that true?

293
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,020
If we wanna die? Shit, no.

294
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:05,340
<i>We want you to die.</i>

295
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,660
- Is that true?
- Well, if it was between you and us, hell yeah.

296
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,580
- Okay.
- Hey! Hey! I don't care if I live or die!

297
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,300
- What about that? - Suicide, man. -
What's all this bullshit with dying?

298
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:21,340
- You want us dead?
- No, darlin', but I do want you to keep your "A."

299
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,260
So, no, I'm gonna make
it real easy on you, okay?

300
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:28,380
All you have to do is tell me the
verb that makes this sentence true.

301
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,380
<i>We choose to do some karate.</i>

302
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,180
- Yeah, right.
- Okay, give me a verb instead of "choose."

303
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,900
<i>- We're going to die?
- We must die, okay.</i>

304
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:41,460
- Okay, "we must die." Is "must" a verb? Can you, uh...
- No, "must" ain't no verb.

305
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:45,980
- Can you "must" something?
- Yeah. I must piss right now. You'd better believe it.

306
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,220
Okay, what verb that we used
today is the most powerful?

307
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,820
- Die.
- Piss.

308
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,180
Oh, you so stupid!

309
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,900
- Choose.
- Choose.

310
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,740
- What's your name?
- Callie.

311
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,140
Callie, why?

312
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,060
Because that's the difference between
owning your life and being afraid.

313
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,780
Saying "I choose" no matter what.

314
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,700
You mean, like a guy's
got a gun to your head...

315
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,340
and he's pulling the trigger
and you say, "I choose to die"?

316
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:24,220
No, you ain't choosin' to die, but you
can choose to die without screaming, right?

317
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,460
I mean, you could
always choose somethin'.

318
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,660
- Not where I live.
- Shit.

319
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,780
Did you read that
somewhere in this class?

320
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:39,260
<i>No. In our class we readin' this
book called My Darling, My Hamburger.</i>

321
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,020
- From this.
- My what?

322
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,900
<i>- My Darling, My Hamburger.
- Hamburger?</i>

323
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,940
Possessive pronoun,
noun, possessive pronoun.

324
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,700
- Oh, watch it, girl.
- Let's see.

325
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,700
E-Excuse me.

326
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,580
- Excuse me, Miss Johnson.
- Uh... Oh, yes.

327
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,700
Would you stop by the principal's
office before your next class, please?

328
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,860
Mr. Grandey would like to speak to you.

329
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,860
The principal!

330
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,220
Oooh, White Bread in trouble!

331
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,140
Yes. I'll talk to you later.

332
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,620
Bye-bye.

333
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:36,460
Miss Johnson, this is an
office. We knock before we enter.

334
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,580
Oh, I'm sorry.

335
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,020
Please.

336
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:51,100
Now, Miss Johnson, I'm taking into
consideration the fact that you're new...

337
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:55,100
and therefore don't know that teaching
karate is against school policy...

338
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:58,980
and can lead to a lawsuit
in case of an injury.

339
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:02,100
But you can avoid this kind of error...
you simply follow the curriculum...

340
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,500
dictated by the Board of Education.

341
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,620
Well, um, sir, that's
almost impossible, um...

342
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:15,180
Most of my students don't
even know what a verb is.

343
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,700
If you're going to teach them,

344
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:21,540
I'm sure there's a better
sentence than "We choose to die."

345
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,820
I'm sure there are, but l... l-I needed a
sentence that would get their attention...

346
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:29,260
- Mmm.
- And, well, it had to be better than this.

347
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,700
Miss Johnson, that is the approved
curriculum for second period.

348
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,900
Your class.

349
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:40,300
Now, I know the newer the
teacher, the smarter she is,

350
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:45,700
but l-I'm afraid you're just going
to have to go along with our policies,

351
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,580
even if you don't agree with them.

352
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,860
- All right?
- Mm-hmm.

353
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,980
What a fuckin' idiot.

354
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,180
- Griffith.
- Don't let them get to you.

355
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,340
I'm not. L-In fact, I'm about to
challenge the entire curriculum.

356
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:11,540
- If I could just find the paper in the xerox room.
- You can't. There isn't any.

357
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,140
- What do you mean?
- I mean there isn't any.

358
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,220
I mean, we're out of xerox paper and
art paper and we're short on pencils.

359
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:22,100
But we do have plenty of students. I
guess that, uh, balances things out.

360
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,100
Thanks.

361
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,620
Another fuckin' idiot.

362
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,540
<i>No, I can't run, I can't
hide from all this pressure</i>

363
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,660
<i>If I sell out, that means
I'm coppin' to a lesser charge</i>

364
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:44,580
<i>- And whenever there's a will baby, there's a way
- Shit!</i>

365
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,500
<i>Each one teach one I always
say the murder rate is risin'</i>

366
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:51,540
<i>Society ain't scarin'me Life is like a
puzzle Ain't no tellin' when they'll bury me</i>

367
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:55,340
<i>- Problems, problems How are we gonna solve 'em
- So, what's on today's lesson plan?</i>

368
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,220
A little kickboxing? Some,
uh, target practice, huh?

369
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,260
No. My own little secret weapon.

370
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:05,060
<i>Problems, problems How
are we gonna solve 'em</i>

371
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:12,020
Okay, so, "never" is...

372
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,220
- It's a verb! - Adverb!
Adverb! - Adverb! Adverb!

373
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,380
Adverb! Fantastic!

374
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,780
- Whoo!
- You guys'll be reading poetry soon.

375
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,220
- You guys are sharp.
- Oh, my...

376
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,940
- Whoa!
- Okay.

377
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,020
<i>- Homeboy!
- King of the calle.!</i>

378
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,340
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

379
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,900
<i>- Sit down.
- Honorable sensei. Hmm.</i>

380
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,740
It's obvious that "homeboy" is a noun.

381
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,740
Noun is correct!

382
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,620
Well, give me my damn candy bar.

383
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,860
- Whoo!
- Thank you.

384
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:50,260
Boy, poetry will be a piece
of cake for this crowd.

385
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:54,300
Yo, how come you keep sayin' poetry?
What's poetry got to do with this shit?

386
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,020
Poetry? Well...

387
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,860
Because if you can read poetry, you
can read just about anything, hon.

388
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:03,460
- When you're ready for poetry, you're ready for bear.
- I say bring on the bear!

389
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:06,780
<i>- I'm always ready for bear. Shit.
- I'm always ready to see you bare.</i>

390
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,820
- Whoa! - Oh, shut up, you
stupid! - Oh, yeah? Ohh! Ohh!

391
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:14,860
Well, okay, here's the bear.

392
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,900
So what the fuck is that?

393
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:23,580
- I just happen to have copies of-of...
of a poem... - Wait for me! Shit!

394
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:27,260
- That's okay.
- Written by the greatest poet.

395
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,300
<i>My Darling, My Hamburger. How's that?</i>

396
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,660
- Okay, here's the deal.
- She was joking about the bear.

397
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:37,860
When we finish this
assignment, I am gonna take...

398
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,660
all of you...

399
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,660
to a place that has...

400
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:45,220
the highest parachute jumps,

401
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,220
the biggest roller coaster,

402
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,260
the best rides,

403
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,980
the most delicious hot dogs,

404
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,660
the hardest games...

405
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:57,660
and the best prizes in the world.

406
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,740
- You're kiddin'.
- For real?

407
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,660
- And we don't gotta pay for it?
- Huh?

408
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,500
- And we don't gotta pay for it?
- Not a penny.

409
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,500
So then, who pays?

410
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,980
The Board of Education.

411
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,180
- Lord, did you hear that?
- I don't believe it.

412
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,820
- Sound good?
- Hey!

413
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,900
That's bullshit, man!

414
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,060
I'm sorry?

415
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,820
Since when has the Board of
Education done anything for us, huh?

416
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,700
Yeah, man, we fuckin' barely get lunch.

417
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:36,740
Well, I'm sorry you
feel that way, Emilio.

418
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,260
Good.

419
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:45,620
- Uh, Durrell, you wanna read the first four lines?
- Oh, man, you trippin', man.

420
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,620
I ain't readin'. You trippin'.

421
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,180
- Okay, how about the f... - You've got
to read it. - How about the first line?

422
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,500
I'm scared to death, motherfucker,
all right? That's all.

423
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:12,340
<i>- Move slowly to the right, people.
- Yep, yep</i>

424
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:15,140
Miss Johnson.

425
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,820
<i>- You better be for real.
- Yep, yep</i>

426
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,340
<i>- Yep, yep

427
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,580
Yes, Callie?

428
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,860
If you wanna get the class
to listen, get Emilio.

429
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,980
<i>- Yep, yep
- It's all right</i>

430
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,980
<i>- It's all right
- As you may have heard</i>

431
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,660
<i>- Yeah
- To smoke a fat one</i>

432
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,540
<i>- To smoke a fat one
- And drink a Thunderbird</i>

433
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:43,340
<i>- Drink a Thunderbird
- It's okay</i>

434
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,220
<i>- It's okay
- To play this loud</i>

435
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:52,020
<i>- Mister DJ, don't mean to sweat you down
- Wait</i>

436
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,260
<i>- I'll get you, you little fucker.
- Yep</i>

437
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,100
- Poetry?
- Poetry, yeah.

438
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,700
- These kids?
- Why not these kids?

439
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,620
Well, hey, go for it.

440
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,220
No, but I gotta find a gimmick first, you
know. Something that'll grab their attention.

441
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,340
- Who's your favorite poet, Griffith?
- My favorite?

442
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:11,180
- Oh, there are so many. How do I choose?
- I'm serious.

443
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,860
Mmm. Serious. Okay.

444
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,260
- Big D. Dylan.
- Get out!

445
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,180
Why not?

446
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,620
Well, I don... He's n... You
know, he's not for everybody.

447
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:23,580
I mean, he's a little
long-winded, don't you think?

448
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,780
I suppose that's 'cause he wrote drunk.

449
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,620
He had a drinking problem?

450
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,180
Well, the guy's Welsh. There
ain't a lot to do there.

451
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,100
I thought he was from Minnesota.

452
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,460
You know, if the guy's your favorite poet,
you might want to read up on him a little bit.

453
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,660
He was Welsh and he
drank himself to death.

454
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,780
Dead? He's not dead. I
saw him yesterday on MTV.

455
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,340
You saw Dylan Thomas on MTV.

456
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,380
<i>No. Bob Dylan.</i>

457
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,660
Oh...

458
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,780
- Bob Dylan? Ohh!
- He looked dead. He looked dead.

459
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:57,260
<i>- Ohh!
- Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man</i>

460
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:00,380
<i>Play a song for me</i>

461
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:04,060
"Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man..."

462
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,140
- Tambourine! -
Tambourine! - Tangerine.

463
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,820
"T-Tambourine Man,

464
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:12,060
"Play a song for me

465
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:16,140
I'm not sleepy and there
is no place I'm going to"

466
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,860
Wow, he can read.

467
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,820
Thank you. Taiwana?

468
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,940
The next three lines, Taiwana.

469
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,140
"Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man

470
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,500
"Play a song for me

471
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:33,100
In the jingle-jangle morning
I'll come following you"

472
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,100
- Good.
- All right.

473
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,980
- Yes.
- What does that mean?

474
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,380
What do you think it means?

475
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,380
What, some guy's got a tambourine...

476
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,780
and this other guy wants him to
play it 'cause he can't sleep.

477
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,460
- Okay.
- Yeah, but how come he want to play the tambourine?

478
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,140
Don't he got a radio or somethin'?
You know what I'm sayin'?

479
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:55,020
Well, you kn... That's a good point.
I mean, i-i-it's... it's a weird choice.

480
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:59,300
So, what if I told you
that Mr. Tambourine Man...

481
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,100
is a code name?

482
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:04,420
- A code name for what?
- James Bond.

483
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,980
- A drug dealer.
- Is it?

484
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,820
Well, a lot of people think so.

485
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,980
You know, this song is from the '60s,
when you couldn't sing about drugs,

486
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,100
so they had to make up codes.

487
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:19,540
So what was the code? What does "Hey, Mr.
Tambourine Man Play a song for me" mean?

488
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,620
- Well, you figure...
- "Play a song for me" means "give me the stuff."

489
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,340
Yeah, it's like that nigger been out
drinkin' all night and smokin' some shit...

490
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,740
and everybody broke out on his
ass, you know what I'm sayin'?

491
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:31,780
And he's high... he's still high, but he's
kinda low and shaky. You know..."jingle-jangle."

492
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:35,100
Yeah, and he needs something, like a
big hit of crack or cocaine and shit.

493
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,140
He's crazy, okay?

494
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:40,140
So, what do you think, Emilio?
Do you think that Raul is right?

495
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:46,580
- All right, it's too personal to discuss.
- What?

496
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,900
You mean you choose not to
participate in the discussion?

497
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,180
- Boy's too slick.
- Not about somethin' so personal.

498
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,340
Wanna draw for it?

499
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,420
What?

500
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,140
High card, you don't
have to discuss anything.

501
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,700
Why do I gotta draw for it?
That's the way it is now.

502
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,860
Listen to this.

503
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:34,460
Name one of the most influential
presidents of the 20th century.

504
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:37,340
- Roosevelt.
- Simple, right?

505
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,780
Wrong. A history teacher's nightmare.

506
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,180
How about Snoop Doggy
Dogg for an answer?

507
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:47,620
Joe Montana. Winston Churchill.

508
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,620
But this... this is the best.

509
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:56,580
"I will not answer this question on the
grounds that it is culturally biased...

510
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,020
against individuals such as myself."

511
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:04,220
Actually, for this answer I'm
gonna give him partial credit.

512
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,700
Louanne, you lose your
sense of humor, it's over.

513
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,180
Uh, here. New pictures of the rug rats.

514
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:15,300
- Oh, God. People are supposed to ask first, Griffith.
- Shut up.

515
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,500
Ohh. They look like Maggie. Thank God.

516
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:24,060
Oh, I don't know. Harry with his thumb
in his mouth, he kinda looks like me.

517
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:27,060
Is that his thumb? I
thought that was a cigarette.

518
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,300
- How is Maggie?
- Good.

519
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,420
She wants you to come over for dinner.

520
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:35,740
We had some fun times, you and
Maggie and me and... what's his name?

521
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,300
- I remember.
- Yeah.

522
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:45,780
I remember too. That's why it's
hard for me to come to dinner.

523
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,100
- Seeing anybody?
- No.

524
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,260
How do you do that? You walk
around with a bag over your head?

525
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:57,060
- No.
- Louanne, it's over six months.

526
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,980
I'm not ready, Hal.

527
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:07,100
You know, I thought you guys always stuck
together. What are you sitting here with me for?

528
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:11,980
<i>You know, he was my best friend,
Louanne. "Was" is the operative word.</i>

529
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,620
He isn't worth your spit.

530
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:26,060
What was that for?

531
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:29,500
Just tell Maggie she's
a lucky lady, Griffith.

532
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:33,140
Yeah, when they made me they
broke the mold. Both of them.

533
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,180
- Good morning, ladies.
- Good morning.

534
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,980
We gotta stop meeting like this.

535
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:55,180
You sound awful.

536
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,860
I refuse to take medical advice...

537
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:01,260
from somebody who eats
Cheetos at 8:00 in the morning.

538
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:05,140
Yeah, well, you shouldn't
smoke. Listen to that cough!

539
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,220
You know...

540
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,700
- I'll see you inside.
- You're gonna finish the cigarette, aren't you?

541
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:16,220
No, I'm not. Really. Honest. I swear.

542
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:19,540
Here! Right here! Yeah!

543
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,700
- Guys are off playin' pool.
- You wanna smoke a cigarette?

544
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,380
- I gave you your money,
man. 350 bucks! - Three-fifty?

545
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,580
What are you talkin' about,
homes? Are you callin' me a liar?

546
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,980
- What, do you think I'm fuckin' stupid?
- Yo, man, no. Don't get loud, motherfucker!

547
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,740
I'm gonna kick your fuckin' spic ass!

548
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:46,460
- Fuck you, man! - Jump back,
motherfucker! - Fight! Fight!

549
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:49,580
<i>- Get back, get back. - You fuckin'
pendejo.! - Okay, okay, okay!</i>

550
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,380
Back off! Hey, hey,
hey, hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

551
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,620
<i>- ¡Puto.!
- One of you makes a move, I will call security!</i>

552
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,340
- Aw, bullshit! - Big fuckin'
deal. - They don't care.

553
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:01,940
Okay, get to your classes.
Okay. It's all over. Move!

554
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:10,260
- You are stronger than these two put together, and you know it!
- Bullshit, man!

555
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,780
<i>- IVato.!
- He wishes, man!</i>

556
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:19,820
You could all be expelled if I report
this to the office, and you know that.

557
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:24,380
Okay, if you give me your word
that it ends here, I'll forget it.

558
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,020
Is it over?

559
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,980
Yeah.

560
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,900
How about you?

561
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,940
<i>- Yeah, simón.
- Absolutely.</i>

562
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:41,820
Okay, I trust you. Now
get to your classes.

563
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,660
<i>See you later, puto.</i>

564
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,820
<i>Catch you later, ése.</i>

565
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:57,900
If you hit those kids,
you'll pay for it. I swear.

566
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,780
Get to your class and behave yourself.

567
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,740
You shouldn't have done that.

568
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:16,660
- Oh? Why not?
- 'Cause you just shouldn't mess with Emilio.

569
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:20,100
Raul knows that if you make a deal
with Emilio and you fuck up on him,

570
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,980
you get your locker
smashed in with your head.

571
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,500
Everybody knows that.

572
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,900
Well, maybe they'll all have
time to think about it...

573
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,660
before they get to the
locker-smashing stage.

574
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,660
They're gonna fight, no
matter what they tell you.

575
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,540
What do you mean?

576
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,140
When? Now?

577
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,780
Where? Angela! Where?

578
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,180
- Come on, motherfucker! Come on!
- Get him!

579
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,620
Keep fightin'! Keep kickin' his ass!

580
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,140
Shit! Fuck!

581
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,420
Ohh!

582
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,220
Oh, shit.

583
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:09,580
- Come on! Fuckin' come on!
- Fuck that!

584
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,020
Shit!

585
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,700
Come on, break it up! Break it up!

586
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:19,860
<i>- Get the fuck off me! - Get outta
there! - IPuto.! You motherfucker!</i>

587
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:24,060
Get back! Now! Get back! Get back!

588
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,420
All of you! Comin' through!

589
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,700
- Watch your head.
- Kickin', man.

590
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:36,020
No. Wait a minute. Wait. No, no.
Gimme... G... Just give me a minute.

591
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,340
- You promised!
- Yeah, but we had to,

592
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:44,220
or we couldn't walk around
with our heads up no more.

593
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,740
We got a reputation to protect.
You a Marine. You understand.

594
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,900
Like, if America didn't stand
up everyone would attack it.

595
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:53,020
Well, in our neighborhood if you don't
stand up you can't walk down the street,

596
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,180
'cause everyone will
attack you, you know?

597
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,420
<i>Rata, you fuckin' puto.</i>

598
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:02,900
<i>- Man, I cracked that motherfucker's head, ése.
- See you in the fuckin' neighborhood, ése.</i>

599
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,260
Okay, I see.

600
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:13,460
And I made it worse and I made you and
Gusmaro look bad in front of everyone...

601
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,700
by saying that Emilio was
stronger than the both of you.

602
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,300
Yeah, well, you thought
you was helpin' us.

603
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:21,700
Ma'am, I'm sorry. We really
have to go. I gotta get 'em home.

604
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,300
Nasty cut.

605
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,940
You mind telling me what the
fight was about in the first place?

606
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,660
Yeah.

607
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:21,100
I really would like to know what happened.
I'm not gonna make any trouble for you.

608
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:24,300
- I just wanna know, was it worth it?
- Yeah, it was worth it.

609
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:27,340
- Why?
- Because it felt good hittin' him in the face.

610
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:30,460
- I got him good, man.
- Yeah, you like to hit people?

611
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,380
Yeah, I like to hit people.

612
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,140
Why?

613
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,740
You feel angry a lot of the time?

614
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:42,660
So now you're gonna
try and psychologize me?

615
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:46,260
You're gonna try and figure
me out? I'll help you.

616
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:49,300
I come from a broken
home, and we're poor. Okay?

617
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,500
I see the same fuckin'
movies you do, man.

618
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,340
I would like to help you, Emilio.

619
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:03,420
Thank you very much. And how
would you like to do that?

620
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,580
You gonna give me some
good advice? "Just say no"?

621
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,980
You gonna get me off the
streets? Well, forget it!

622
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:13,020
How the fuck you gonna
save me from my life, huh?

623
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,500
<i>Yep, yep</i>

624
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,380
Karen?

625
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,460
I have three, uh, student files here...

626
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:30,700
<i>- and I can't find a phone number in any of 'em.
- Yep, yep</i>

627
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:33,020
Well, sometimes they
don't give a number...

628
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,460
<i>- and sometimes they don't have a phone.
- Yep, yep</i>

629
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:39,420
<i>- It's all right - It's all
right - As you might have heard</i>

630
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:42,420
<i>- Yeah - To smoke a fat
one - To smoke a fat one</i>

631
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,140
<i>- And drink a 'Bird
- A Thunderbird</i>

632
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,420
<i>- It's okay
- It's okay</i>

633
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:50,300
<i>- To play this loud
- Oh, play it loud</i>

634
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:55,140
<i>Mister DJ, don't mean to sweat you down</i>

635
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,300
<i>- It's all right
- It's all right</i>

636
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,740
<i>- As you may have heard
- Yeah</i>

637
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,340
<i>- To smoke a fat one
- Smoke a fat one</i>

638
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:07,060
<i>- And drink a 'Bird
- A Thunderbird, now</i>

639
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:11,380
<i>It's okay</i>

640
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,740
Come on. Come on.

641
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,620
Do your homework.

642
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:47,540
- You have a lovely family, Mrs. Sanchero.
- Thank you.

643
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:54,740
We know why you're here, Miss Johnson.

644
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:59,100
I warned Raul to stay out of trouble.

645
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:02,420
He's first in our family to
maybe graduate high school.

646
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,500
- So he gonna get punished big for what he done.
- N...

647
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,940
Don't you worry about that.

648
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:11,820
But he didn't do anything wrong.

649
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:15,540
- But he expelled for three days.
- I know. No, I know.

650
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:20,140
But he didn't start the fight. He was
defending himself from a bigger boy.

651
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,740
He was protecting himself.

652
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:25,540
- Uh, why they send him home?
- It's just school policy.

653
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:28,860
L-l-It gives the other
boy time to cool down.

654
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,300
Actually,

655
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:35,500
I'm here because I just wanted
to tell you both personally...

656
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:39,420
what a pleasure it's been having
Raul in my class this semester.

657
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,860
You must be very proud.

658
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,580
Yes.

659
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:49,580
He's, um... Well, he's very bright...

660
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,980
and funny, articulate.

661
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,900
The truth is, he's...
he's one of my favorites.

662
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:41,540
<i>Uh, soy Louanne Johnson.</i>

663
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:49,180
Oh.

664
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:54,100
"I will not go down underground

665
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:56,780
'Cause somebody tells me
that death's comin' 'round"

666
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,300
Okay, this is another Dylan poem.

667
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:04,460
Now, is that a code, or does
that just mean what it says?

668
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,780
"And I will not carry myself down to die

669
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,020
When I go to my grave
My head will be high"

670
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,460
"My head will be high."
What does that mean?

671
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:23,460
Anybody.

672
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:29,340
Nobody.

673
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:31,740
Is there something I should know?

674
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,780
Yeah. I'll tell you.

675
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:38,420
You ratted on Raul, Gusmaro and Emilio.

676
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,020
Yeah. You got Emilio put into detention.

677
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:43,060
<i>It wasn't none of your
business, chismosa.</i>

678
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:45,340
And you got Raul and Gusmaro suspended.

679
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:47,460
- Now they're gonna get their fuckin' asses kicked.
- And you got Emilio...

680
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,820
<i>- Hey, I didn't rat on anybody.
- Wasn't none of your business anyway, you chismosa.</i>

681
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:53,060
- Bullshit. - Let this... -
Told you she was full of shit.

682
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:57,060
- Snitches get stitches, bitch.
- Do you wanna talk about this?

683
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:00,500
On you, shit. Whatever
floats your boat, teach.

684
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:02,780
We don't have no choices in this room.

685
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,500
Well, if you all feel that
strongly about it, leave the room.

686
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:07,740
- What?
- Hey, listen.

687
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:13,380
Nobody's forcing you to be here. You have
a choice. You can stay, or you can leave.

688
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,340
Lady, why are you playin' this
game? We don't have a choice.

689
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:19,740
You don't have a choice? You don't have
a choice on whether or not you're here?

690
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:23,060
No. If we leave, we don't get to graduate.
If we stay, we gotta put up with you.

691
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:25,180
Well, that's a choice,
isn't it? You have a choice.

692
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:27,340
You either don't graduate or
you have to put up with me.

693
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:30,100
It may not be a choice you
like, but it is a choice.

694
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:33,260
Man, you don't understand nothin'. I
mean, you don't come from where we live.

695
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:37,140
- You... You're not bussed here.
- Do you have a choice to get on that bus?

696
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,580
Man, you come and live in my
neighborhood for one week...

697
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:41,740
and then you tell me
if you got a choice.

698
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:46,300
There are a lot of people who live in your
neighborhood who choose not to get on that bus.

699
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:49,020
What do they choose to do? They
choose to go out and sell drugs.

700
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,460
They choose to go out and kill people.
They choose to do a lot of other things.

701
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,380
But they choose not to get on that bus.

702
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:58,780
The people who choose to get on that bus,
which are you, are the people who are saying,

703
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,180
"I will not carry myself down to die

704
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,980
When I go to my grave
My head will be high"

705
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:06,220
That is a choice.

706
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:08,620
There are no victims in this classroom!

707
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,820
Why do you care anyway?
You just here for the money.

708
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:18,420
Because I make a choice to care.
And, honey, the money ain't that good.

709
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,860
- Whatever.
- Read it again, Miss Johnson.

710
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:24,700
- What?
- Read those lines you just read again.

711
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,260
"I will not go down underground

712
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:44,140
'Cause somebody tells me
that death's comin' 'round"

713
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:50,460
Does that mean just what it says?

714
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:55,540
No, it don't mean just what it says.

715
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:58,100
Because...

716
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:00,540
you wouldn't go under the ground...

717
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:04,220
if someone told you death was comin'.

718
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:07,780
But you would go into the
ground if you were already dead.

719
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:18,100
Do the rest of you agree with that?

720
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:27,100
Well, I kinda agree with it,

721
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:30,980
but I think it just means that...

722
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:32,780
he ain't gonna help death out, you know?

723
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:35,500
It's not like he's just gonna
lay down and wait for it.

724
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:40,060
I think he's gonna choose... No, I
think he's gonna make the choice...

725
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:41,980
to die hard.

726
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:45,900
Mm-hmm.

727
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:48,300
- Yeah, I agree with that.
- Yeah, me too.

728
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,260
- That's what it sounds like to me.
- Okay.

729
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:53,820
Well, what about, uh,
the rest of it? Um...

730
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:55,860
"When I go to my grave
My head will be high"

731
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:58,580
"Head will be high."
What does that mean?

732
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:02,420
- You're gonna die with pride.
- Right.

733
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,020
- See you tomorrow.
- Callie, wait up!

734
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:29,500
You went to Raul's house last
night, and Gusmaro's too, right?

735
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:32,100
Mm-hmm.

736
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,340
Yeah, that's what they told me.

737
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:37,940
That's cool.

738
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:52,420
<i>Hold up, wait a minute Don't
go there 'cause I ain't with it</i>

739
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:55,780
<i>Hold up, wait a minute Don't
go there 'cause I ain't with it</i>

740
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:03,260
<i>What you want Baby, I got it</i>

741
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:06,380
<i>What you need Babe, you got it</i>

742
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:09,500
<i>All I'm askin' is for a little respect</i>

743
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:14,740
Yo, kick it, homes! What
you waitin' for, man?

744
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:17,900
<i>- Are you trying to steal my $2.50, ése?
- Ah, go, go, go.</i>

745
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:22,140
Man, that ain't shit. Go
faster, man. Go faster, man.

746
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:30,660
<i>- Come on, come on - Faster, man,
faster! - You got to gimme, gimme</i>

747
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:34,020
<i>- R-E-S-P-E-C-T - I
got to get it, get it</i>

748
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:37,300
<i>- R-E-S-P-E-C-T - You
got to gimme, gimme</i>

749
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:40,580
<i>- R-E-S-P-E-C-T - I
got to get it, get it</i>

750
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:42,300
<i>- R-E-S-P-E-C-T -
Come on, get back.</i>

751
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:45,420
Are you all right, man? That
looked like a real bitch right then.

752
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:49,340
Hey, get the fuck out of there, man. Look
at you! You look like my grandma, man.

753
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:54,580
<i>- R-E-S-P-E-C-T
- Miss Johnson,</i>

754
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:57,620
the... the School Board would have
every right to insist on your dismissal.

755
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:00,820
You informed no one. You
got no permission slips.

756
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:05,220
Oh, but there was no one to inform. All the kids just
decided to go to the amusement park at the last minute.

757
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:07,940
And then they let me come along.

758
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:11,100
- Did they pay for you?
- No, I paid for them.

759
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:17,500
I was just so moved by the invitation.

760
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:23,420
This wasn't, by any chance,

761
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:28,020
their reward for reading
poetry, was it, Miss Johnson?

762
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:32,660
In my class, Mr. Grandey,
poetry is its own reward.

763
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:40,340
Angela, would you read the first line?

764
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:44,660
"Appetizers. Freshly cut bay
shrimp grilled to perfection."

765
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:48,260
- This is a Xerox of a menu.
- That is correct.

766
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:52,220
It's from The Flowering Peach,
the best restaurant in town.

767
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:55,380
- Ever hear of it?
- Yeah, we heard of it.

768
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:57,700
It's supposed to be like some
special restaurant or somethin'.

769
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:59,940
Mm-hmm. So, does it sound good?

770
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:05,980
Because whoever wins the, uh,
the... the Dylan-Dylan contest...

771
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,420
- The what?
- Goes there for dinner with me.

772
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:11,380
Hey, what's the
Dylan-Dylan contest about?

773
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:13,300
Well.

774
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:18,300
There's Bob Dylan,

775
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:20,900
who we've been reading.

776
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:22,820
And then...

777
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:27,140
there's Dylan Thomas,

778
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:28,860
who also wrote poems.

779
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:32,340
If you can find the poem
written by Dylan Thomas...

780
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:37,220
that is like a poem
written by Bob Dylan,

781
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:39,540
you win the Dylan-Dylan contest.

782
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:44,260
<i>Hey, Mr. Tambourine
Man Play a song for me</i>

783
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:50,140
<i>I'm not sleepy and there
is no place I'm going to</i>

784
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:55,220
<i>Hey, Mr. Tambourine
Man Play a song for me</i>

785
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,700
<i>In the jingle-jangle morning</i>

786
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:01,220
<i>I'll come following you</i>

787
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:17,740
Yo, every fuckin' poem Dylan
Thomas wrote is about death, man.

788
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:20,020
Now, how we supposed to
know which one to write?

789
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:23,380
"The sniper laid him low,
and strewed his brains.

790
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:25,460
"One would not think the
greenness of this valley...

791
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:27,540
could let a day be sick
with so much blood."

792
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:30,860
Man, that's some Rambo-Schwarzenegger
bullshit you found.

793
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:32,780
- That's how it's supposed to be, right?
- No.

794
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:35,060
- There's supposed to be killing shit.
- But it... But it don't...

795
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:37,820
But it don't even mean the same as
"I will not go under the ground."

796
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:41,980
Now you're some sort of
poetic critic, now, right?

797
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:44,220
- Oh, well, it don't.
- Thank you.

798
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:46,860
Okay. Listen to this.

799
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:51,620
"Do not go gentle into that good night.

800
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:55,180
"Old age should burn
and rave at close of day.

801
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:59,100
Rage, rage against the
dying of the light."

802
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:02,540
Where's the code? Where's the death?

803
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:05,340
Night. All that stuff
about night. That's death.

804
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:08,740
So it's "Don't go gentle
into that good death."

805
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:12,260
Yeah, but I think "good" is sarcastic.

806
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:16,380
When he say, "Do not go gentle,"
that's like sayin', "Don't go easy."

807
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,980
- So it's the same as "I will not go down."
- We just won us a motherfucking chicken.

808
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:22,420
Shh.

809
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:25,300
<i>This is the life</i>

810
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:29,300
<i>Everyone has to be somewhere</i>

811
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:34,740
<i>Oh</i>

812
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:39,700
<i>I am here</i>

813
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:48,820

<i>This is the life</i>

815
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:57,900
<i>- This is my - Well, the results
of the Dylan-Dylan contest are in.</i>

816
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:59,900
<i>- Life
- The winners are...</i>

817
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:03,740
- That's me. Right here.
- Sit down. I am Bob Dylan. Sit down.

818
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:06,740
- Yo, shh! Shh!
- Sorry, Miss Johnson.

819
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:09,140
- Shh.
- Shh.

820
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:13,620
Raul, Durrell and Callie!

821
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,420
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

822
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:23,540
- Here's your certificate.
- Hey! - Congratulations.

823
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:26,460
Congratulations, Callie.

824
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:28,940
Okay!

825
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:31,740
But there are no losers in
this class. You guys did great.

826
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:34,140
You all get to pick
a prize from the box.

827
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:37,340
How come they get a prize
when they got the wrong answer?

828
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:40,860
Well, because sometimes it takes a lot
of wrong answers to get to the right one.

829
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:44,180
Hey, everyone can't
be right, 'cept for us!

830
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:48,460
Come on up.

831
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:58,620
- Miss Johnson?
- Hey, Callie.

832
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:02,300
- Um, I wanted to talk to you
about the restaurant. - Uh-huh.

833
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:04,700
- I can't go.
- Why?

834
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:07,700
Because I have to work at this supermarket
every night until June and I already told them...

835
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:09,620
Oh, isn't there any
way to get out of it?

836
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:13,180
No. Because of the schedule
and everything, I have to do it.

837
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:17,060
- But thank you anyway.
- Well, o-okay. Well.

838
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:19,620
Shoot.

839
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:24,100
Well, no, it's okay. If you can't come to
dinner, then, uh, well, we'll bring dinner to you.

840
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:27,700
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

841
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:30,580
- Thank you.
- I'm taking orders, Miss Roberts.

842
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:41,500
I couldn't find a parking space.

843
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:43,420
It's okay. I just got here myself.

844
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:46,020
- Oh, you look very handsome.
- How 'bout this jacket?

845
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:47,940
It's fantastic.

846
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:49,940
Go ahead, touch it. It's real leather.

847
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:52,700
- Ooh!
- Hey, where's Callie?

848
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:55,020
Oh, she had to work. Where's Durrell?

849
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:58,580
- Oh, he had to work too.
- Oh.

850
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:02,180
Well, I guess it's just
you and me, handsome.

851
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,100
I guess so.

852
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,860
Oh. Ladies first.

853
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:09,780
Thank you.

854
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:19,220
- Hey, are you sure they
got chicken? - Mm-hmm.

855
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:26,140
May I tell you a little
about this evening's specials?

856
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:31,420
The chef is featuring foie gras with
smoked duck and figs on a hill of bulgar.

857
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:34,900
<i>Uh, salmon tartar in potato gaufrette...</i>

858
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:37,740
over wild mushrooms, and fennel salad.

859
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:40,020
Uh, for the entree we're featuring...

860
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:43,780
a complex shellfish pan roast with orso,

861
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:47,580
a touch of comfit and a broth
thickened with lobster shell oil.

862
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:50,540
All very, very good.

863
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:55,180
- Could we have a few minutes, please?
- Ah, yes.

864
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:57,540
Thank you.

865
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:59,780
- Are you sure they got chicken?
- Yes.

866
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:02,620
<i>Here. See, it's right there,
sweetie. You see? Poulet.</i>

867
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:07,860
And when the waiter comes back,
you may as well talk to him.

868
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:11,100
It'll be good practice for
your summer job interviews.

869
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:13,820
I can't talk to that guy. He probably
thinks I'm weird or something.

870
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:18,140
He does not. He can't help
but notice your natural charm.

871
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:21,980
You just look him straight in the eye and
you talk to him like you would anyone else.

872
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:24,780
Now, go ahead and call him over.

873
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:31,380
Go ahead. Just give him a little nod.

874
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:40,180
- Are we ready?
- Okay, I'll have the chicken.

875
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:44,060
A whole one.

876
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:49,260
And I'll have the same.

877
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:52,180
And one to go, please.

878
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:55,340
One to go. Thank you.

879
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:13,500
Hey, Miss J?

880
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:18,420
I was wondering maybe, like, in
the next couple of days, if l...

881
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:21,940
- Is everything all right?
- Everything's fine. Thank you.

882
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:24,060
All right.

883
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:26,500
Now don't be mad or nothing,
but I gotta be absent...

884
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:29,140
for a couple of days without
your coming to my house.

885
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:31,940
It's important.

886
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:35,460
- You'll have to tell me why.
- I got some shit to do.

887
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:41,180
I gotta make some money
to pay back this guy.

888
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:48,020
This doesn't sound important
enough to cut school.

889
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:50,860
It is. I gotta pay for this jacket.

890
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:53,220
See, I got it off the street
from this guy for 200 dollars,

891
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:55,140
and he said he'd trust
me for it until Friday.

892
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:58,140
Why did you buy it on the
street instead of in a store?

893
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:01,140
Are you crazy? You know how
much this would cost in a store?

894
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:05,140
I needed a nice jacket and fast, and I got
it from this guy 'cause he cut me a deal...

895
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:09,580
'cause he stole it, probably.

896
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:14,220
So, are you gonna go out and get a job or are
you gonna go out and steal too to pay him back?

897
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:16,740
Miss J, I gotta pay him back.

898
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:18,940
He'll kill me.

899
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:21,980
I didn't have nothing to wear!

900
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:34,060
Fine. I'll lend it to you.

901
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:38,580
I can't take your money. Teachers
are poor. Everyone knows that.

902
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:42,540
Well, you don't really
have a choice, do you?

903
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:44,980
If you don't pay the
guy back, he'll kill you.

904
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:48,740
If you cut school, I'll tell
your father and he'll kill you.

905
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:53,300
- So I'm your only way out.
- Oh, man.

906
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:56,540
- But I do have one condition.
- Big?

907
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:58,580
- Huge.
- What do you want, interest?

908
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:01,900
- Mm-mmm. Bigger. -
Jesus Christ, what is it?

909
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:05,780
Well.

910
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:08,900
- Would you like dessert?
- No!

911
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:11,860
- Another glass of wine?
- Oh, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

912
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:14,740
- Coffee, perhaps?
- Hey, man, we're talking!

913
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:20,820
So, what's the condition?

914
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:26,500
You have to pay me back
on the day you graduate.

915
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:31,100
But... But what if I don't graduate?

916
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:34,540
Well, then you'll never
pay me back the money.

917
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:38,060
But I know that if you say you will,

918
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:40,780
you'll kill yourself keeping your word.

919
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:03,740
Well, what do you say?

920
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:07,940
I don't get it. Why do you
care so much if I graduate?

921
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:10,220
Weird, isn't it?

922
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:17,700
All right, I'll pay you back.

923
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:24,060
- You have my word.
- Hey.

924
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:26,820
It is a very nice jacket.

925
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:31,260
Thank you.

926
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:51,780
- Hey. -
Oh, hi! - Hi.

927
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:54,140
- How you doin'?
- Oh, good.

928
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:57,620
I think this is the first time I
ever brought food into a supermarket.

929
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:01,060
- Yeah, I can smell it from
here. - Yeah. - Good. Thanks.

930
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:04,220
Well, Raul says if you don't like
it, he'll take it off your hands.

931
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:07,700
Oh, please. Like hell he will.

932
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:10,580
<i>Callie, could you help
load in aisle three, please?</i>

933
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:15,420
Be right there. I'm telling you, this place
would fall to pieces if it wasn't for me.

934
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:18,620
You know, Callie,

935
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:20,540
just between you and me,

936
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:25,660
with your scores, I think you should
consider going into Advanced English.

937
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:29,420
- Oh, but I'm gonna be at Clearview. You didn't know?
- No.

938
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:32,940
You didn't see my record? I tell you.

939
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:34,860
No, l... I didn't know.

940
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:37,620
- Bye now.
- Yeah.

941
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:42,420
In the middle of a semester?
Are... Are you moving?

942
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,820
No. I'm pregnant.

943
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:48,500
And since I'm startin' to show,
they thought it was time, you know?

944
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:55,780
- Who thought it was time?
- The school. They don't let you stay there if you're pregnant.

945
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:59,220
But they told me they have this really good
program at Clearview for, like, teenage mothers.

946
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:03,100
And they teach you stuff like parenting
and nutrition, all kinds of stuff.

947
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:05,700
So I thought it would
be good for me, you know?

948
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:08,020
<i>- Yeah.
- Aisle three.</i>

949
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:12,940
"Degrade first the arts
if you'd mankind degrade."

950
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:16,220
Hey, that's the spray can poem.

951
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:22,780
- Hey, hey, what's the code word?
- The code word is "great rides and great prizes."

952
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:25,500
<i>I'm keeping it undercover
But comin'soon, I surmises</i>

953
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:30,700
Does anybody know where, um,
Durrell and Lionel are today?

954
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:36,260
- Durrell and Lionel.
- No. - They around.

955
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:40,420
Yeah, so what's the prize we're
gonna get for learning this poem?

956
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:44,020
Learning is the prize.

957
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:45,940
Yeah.

958
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:48,980
Knowing how to read something
and understand it is the prize.

959
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:52,220
Okay? Knowing how to think is the prize.

960
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:55,580
- I know how to think right now.
- Okay. Well, yeah, well, you know how to run too.

961
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:57,980
But not the way you
could run if you trained.

962
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,860
You know, the mind is like a muscle.

963
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:04,780
Okay? And if you want it to be really
powerful, you got to work it out. Okay?

964
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:09,420
Each new fact gives you another choice.

965
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:13,140
Each new idea builds
another muscle, okay?

966
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:16,180
And it's those muscles that are
gonna make you really strong.

967
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:20,180
Those are your weapons,
and in this unsafe world...

968
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:22,260
I want to arm you.

969
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:26,180
- And that's what these poems are supposed to do?
- Yeah.

970
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:28,740
Hey, try it. You're
just sittin' here anyway.

971
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:31,620
Look. Okay. If at the end of the term,

972
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:34,700
you're not faster, stronger and smarter,

973
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:37,660
you will have lost nothing.

974
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:40,860
But if you are,

975
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:45,780
you'll be that much
tougher to knock down.

976
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:51,220
So what's "Hire idiots to paint
with cold light and hot shade"?

977
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:54,140
They're being sarcastic, Raul.

978
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:56,540
I mean, 'cause you know that light
is supposed to be warm, right?

979
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:58,620
- And shade is supposed to be what?
- Cold?

980
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:02,580
Exactly. But if you go and hire an idiot
to do the job, he's gonna do it backwards.

981
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:04,860
- Hello. - There
you go. - Hmm.

982
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:08,860
Don't make a big fuss
about this, Louanne.

983
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:12,140
You have to help me. You have
no idea how bright this girl is.

984
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:15,100
Yes, I do. And there's
nothing I can do about it.

985
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:18,580
Oh! That just makes me crazy!

986
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:22,020
What right do these miserable, self-righteous
sons of bitches from the Board of Education...

987
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:25,100
have to make a moral
judgment on Callie Roberts?

988
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:27,220
- Do you know...
- Louanne, there are parents in the next room.

989
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:29,180
Look, I don't c... I'm
gonna fight this ruling.

990
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:33,140
I'm gonna write an open letter to every
newspaper condemning the entire School Board.

991
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:35,500
- Oh, you can't do that.
- Why not?

992
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:39,340
Well, first of all, the Board
has nothing to do with it.

993
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:45,420
We prefer that these girls go to the
mother-to-be program at Clearview.

994
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:51,260
Oh, wait a minute.

995
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:55,060
You mean this isn't a rule? You
mean this is your preference?

996
01:06:56,420 --> 01:06:58,340
Well, yes.

997
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:02,460
You mean Callie Roberts is free
to go to any school she wants?

998
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:06,900
- Including this one?
- Unless she's absent for more than 30 days.

999
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:09,460
And then she has to wait until the
baby's born before she can come back here.

1000
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:15,140
But, Louanne, once these girls have babies,
very few of them come back to school anyway.

1001
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:17,620
I see.

1002
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:21,700
So you make them think
they have to leave.

1003
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:24,940
You just push 'em out a little
earlier, make it a little harder,

1004
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:27,100
make it a little more hopeless.

1005
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:29,420
I do what I have to do...

1006
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:32,420
because it is dangerous to have
a pregnant girl in a classroom.

1007
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:37,060
It's not a warning, Louanne. L-It's
prestige, it's stardom, it's attention.

1008
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:39,340
You know, not all these girls
become pregnant by accident.

1009
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:42,500
<i>- Pregnancy is contagious.
- Yep, yep</i>

1010
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:44,420
<i>- It's all right
- It's all right</i>

1011
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:46,860

- Drink a Thunderbird</i>

1014
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:54,500
<i>- It's okay
- It's okay</i>

1015
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:57,340
<i>- To play this loud
- Play it loud</i>

<i>Mister DJ, don't mean to sweat you down</i>

1017
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:03,260
Who is it?

1018
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:06,580
It's Louanne Johnson,
Callie's second period teacher.

1019
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:12,860
Hi.

1020
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:16,060
Um, Callie's getting
ready to go to work.

1021
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:17,900
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

<i>Curiosity killed the cat</i>

1023
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:22,300
- Oh. - Hi.
- Hi, there.

1024
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:25,460
- What you doing?
- Watching TV.

1025
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:30,220
- What's your name?
- Tyeisha.

1026

- Oh, that's a pretty name.
- She just love her TV.

1027
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:36,980
Why ain't you in bed? Come here, baby.

1028

Callie? Honey? Your teacher's here.

1029

- Hi.
- Hi.

1030
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:51,300
I'm sorry to just bust in on you like
this, but I have the most wonderful news...

1031
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:54,140
and I wanted to come
tell you personally.

1032
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:57,260
You do not have to go to Clearview.

1033
01:08:57,340 --> 01:09:02,420
There is nothing in the rules that says
you can't stay exactly where you are.

1034
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:04,380
But, uh, she already
enrolled in Clearview.

1035
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:07,500
Uh, well, that's all right. She...
that... But she doesn't have to go there.

1036
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:11,060
Yeah, but Kimboley wants me to take the
mother-to-be program at Clearview, you know.

1037
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:14,420
He thought it would be a good idea if I
learned how to take care of the baby and stuff.

1038
01:09:16,540 --> 01:09:19,380
I don't understand.

1039
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:22,980
Do you not want to stay at Parkmont?

1040
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:26,340
Well, yeah, but I gotta learn
how to take care of us, you know.

1041
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:28,820
I mean, we're getting our own
place and everything, so...

1042
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:35,300
Callie, just don't throw
away all you can become.

1043
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:40,180
Kimboley was so right. He was so right.

1044
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:42,940
He told me that you'd probably
try to talk me out of this.

1045
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:44,940
You want to know what else he said?

1046
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:47,540
He said that you probably
don't even like men...

1047
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:50,300
and that you're probably not married
and you don't want anybody else to be.

1048
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:53,380
That's why you're always
in everybody else's life.

1049
01:09:57,060 --> 01:10:00,500
Look, I'm not saying that
I agree with him, okay?

1050
01:10:00,580 --> 01:10:03,420
Well, Kimboley's wrong.

1051
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:05,860
I was married...

1052
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:07,780
and I was pregnant.

1053
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:12,780
So what happened?

1054
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:17,180
We got divorced...

1055
01:10:17,260 --> 01:10:20,220
and I had an abortion.

1056
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:25,660
He beat me.

1057
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:31,580
Well, sometimes you start out wrong...

1058
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:34,620
and just keep going.

1059
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,580
Hey, don't touch me. Oh, get outta here!

1060
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:55,180
I'll see you.

1061
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:57,780
<i>You took something that
fuckin' belonged to me, ése.</i>

1062
01:10:57,860 --> 01:11:00,780
Man, she came to me with open arms.

1063
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:03,220
Besides, you gotta have one of these.

1064
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:07,020
You're dead.

1065
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:21,780
<i>As I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death</i>

1066
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:24,980
<i>I take a look at my life and
realize there's nothing left</i>

1067
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:27,540
<i>'Cause I've been blastin'
and laughin'so long</i>

1068
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:30,700
<i>That even my mama thinks
that my mind is gone</i>

1069
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:33,380
<i>I really hate to trip but I gotta loc</i>

1070
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,860
<i>As they croak I see
myself in the pistol smoke</i>

1071
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:39,580
<i>Fool, I'm the kind of"G" the
little homies wanna be like</i>

1072
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:42,620
<i>On my knees in the night
sayin'prayers in the street light</i>

1073
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:47,940
<i>Been spendin'most their lives
livin'in a gangsta's paradise</i>

1074
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:50,020
<i>- Hey, Miss Johnson. - Hey! -
Been spendin'most their lives</i>

1075
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:53,460
<i>- Haven't seen you guys in a week.
- Livin'in a gangsta's paradise</i>

1076
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:56,100
Thought maybe you got
lost on your way to class.

1077
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:58,220
I wanted to help you find your way back.

1078
01:11:58,300 --> 01:12:00,860
Get on inside.

1079
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:03,780
Clean up that pigsty of a room.

1080
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:11,580
Hi. I'm Louanne Johnson.
I'm the boys' teacher.

1081
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:13,500
I know who you are.

1082
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:17,100
You're that white-bread bitch
messin' with my babies' minds.

1083
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:19,020
I beg your pardon?

1084
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:22,100
My boys don't go to your school
no more, and that's gonna be it.

1085
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:26,220
- You took 'em out of school?
- You're damn right I did.

1086
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:29,980
I saw what they were bringing
home... poetry and shit.

1087
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:34,740
A waste of time. They got more
important things to worry about.

1088
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:40,940
Don't you think that finishing high
school will be valuable to their future?

1089
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:42,940
That's not in their future.

1090
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:46,780
I ain't raising no doctors and
lawyers here. They got bills to pay.

1091
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:49,020
Why don't you just get on outta here.

1092
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:52,980
Go find yourself some
other poor boys to save.

1093
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:08,700
Mama! I could stand some lemonade.

1094
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:18,420
"It is easier to forgive an enemy...

1095
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:21,100
"than to forgive a friend.

1096
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:24,980
"The man who permits
you to injure him...

1097
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:27,740
"deserves your vengeance.

1098
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:31,180
He also will receive it."

1099
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:33,980
Wow, who wrote that? Some Mafia guy?

1100
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:35,900
You know, let's go on
with this poem tomorrow.

1101
01:13:35,980 --> 01:13:38,220
Why don't you... Take out your work
sheets and do the vocabulary drill.

1102
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:41,580
- Say what? - Oh, man! - Man,
I don't wanna do no vocabulary.

1103
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:43,820
I don't wanna do no damn vocabulary.

1104
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:46,060
Then don't.

1105
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:49,460
What do you mean? You
mean I have a choice?

1106
01:13:49,580 --> 01:13:53,260
You're not gonna let me get away with
not learnin' my vocabulary, right?

1107
01:13:56,540 --> 01:13:59,860
That's right. You have
to do your vocabulary.

1108
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:02,540
Words are thoughts and we
can't think without 'em.

1109
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:05,940
So... Please?

1110
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:09,620
And so let's just do it, man. She's
gonna be down our back in a minute.

1111
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:12,980
- Whatever. She's grouchy.
- Grouch.

1112
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:15,700
- Thanks, Louanne.
- Grouch, grouch.

1113
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:18,900
Thank you, Louanne. Such
a nice lady, Louanne.

1114
01:14:21,180 --> 01:14:24,220
What do I do? What the
fuck you want from me?

1115
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:27,060
Who, my teacher? You think I'm
gonna fuckin' talk to a teacher?

1116
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:29,580
Like they're gonna
really help me, huh? Huh?

1117
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:32,660
Teachers aren't gonna
fuckin' help me, okay?

1118
01:14:32,780 --> 01:14:36,580
Miss Johnson! Miss Johnson,
we gotta talk to you.

1119
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:39,540
- There's nothing to talk about, Angela!
- What, are you Superman?

1120
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:42,580
Is your ass bulletproof? Is
that what you think? Tell her!

1121
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:45,300
- Tell her what you're gonna do.
- What is it?

1122
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:48,220
- He's strapped.
- Shut the fuck up! She don't need to know my business.

1123
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:51,100
Is your business dying? No!

1124
01:14:51,180 --> 01:14:54,020
There's this crackhead named
Shorty. He just came out of jail.

1125
01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:56,500
He says that I'm his girl and
that Emilio took me from him.

1126
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:58,940
And now he wants to kill Emilio.

1127
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:03,980
Emilio, if this boy is threatening
you, we can go to the police.

1128
01:15:04,060 --> 01:15:06,300
Look, this is nothing
you can do anything about.

1129
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:09,060
This guy is looking for me to kill me,
and the only way for me to stop him...

1130
01:15:09,180 --> 01:15:11,540
is for me to kill him first.

1131
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:13,940
That's just the way it is, all right?

1132
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:17,300
Wait, Emilio, wait, wait, wait, wait,
no! Can we... Can we talk about this?

1133
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:19,980
- Come to my house.
- Yeah, right.

1134
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:22,220
Oh, what? You're too proud to hide?

1135
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:25,420
It's better to wander
the streets all night?

1136
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:28,380
- Come on.
- Please?

1137
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:30,300
Please, just go.

1138
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:36,700
Go. Go.

1139
01:15:38,540 --> 01:15:40,980
- Can we drop you?
- Just go.

1140
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:58,940
Is this boy your age?

1141
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:05,140
- Yeah.
- Does he go to Parkmont?

1142
01:16:05,220 --> 01:16:08,020
I won't tell you who it is.

1143
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:09,940
No, don't.

1144
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:14,900
But if you tell Mr. Grandey about him...

1145
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:18,780
not about his threatening you,
but about his being on crack...

1146
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:20,180
not about his threatening you,
but about his being on crack...

1147
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:24,620
he'll be turned over to the juvenile
court for... for drug abuse in school.

1148
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:26,740
H-He won't serve hard time,

1149
01:16:26,860 --> 01:16:31,220
but by the time he gets out and he's detoxed,
he... he will have gotten over trying to kill you.

1150
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:39,940
No, I can't rat on him.

1151
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:42,900
Right. Kill him. That's better.

1152
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:46,900
Man,

1153
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:48,820
you don't understand.

1154
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:56,660
You asked me once how I was
gonna save you from your life.

1155
01:16:56,740 --> 01:16:59,260
This is how. This moment.

1156
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:03,540
Right now.

1157
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:06,940
This will make the difference
in your life forever.

1158
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:37,020
Emilio?

1159
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:45,740
Emilio?

1160
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:01,780
- Oh, Mr. Grandey.
- Is there a problem, Miss Johnson?

1161
01:18:01,860 --> 01:18:03,740
- Shouldn't you be in class?
- Yes, I'm late.

1162
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:08,540
Um, I just wanted to ask. Did Emilio
Ramirez come to your office this morning?

1163
01:18:08,620 --> 01:18:11,140
- Yes.
- Oh, God. Oh, thank God.

1164
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:14,100
- Did you talk to him?
- No, I sent him away.

1165
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:16,260
You... What do you mean?

1166
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:21,980
- I mean I sent him away.
- Why?

1167
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:24,540
Because he didn't knock, Miss Johnson.

1168
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:28,620
- Here we are.
- Because he didn't knock?

1169
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:32,860
Yes, Miss Johnson. I'm trying to teach
these children how to live in the world.

1170
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:36,100
And in the world, you just don't
burst into someone's office.

1171
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:41,580
Because he didn't knock?

1172
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:46,700
Damn it!

1173
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:19,860
Uh, Louanne.

1174
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:24,140
Mr. Grandey is with the police.

1175
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:26,380
- Yes?
- Um.

1176
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:29,940
They just found Emilio Ramirez
three blocks from the school.

1177
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:32,660
He was shot this morning.

1178
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:36,660
Is he dead?

1179
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:43,020
- He's dead.
- I'm very sorry.

1180
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:46,860
Um...

1181
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:48,980
are you going to tell them now?

1182
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:53,700
Do you think that's wise?

1183
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:58,580
Yeah.

1184
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:02,100
Well, uh, perhaps if you talk to
them a little bit about death...

1185
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:05,300
and... and... and what it means.

1186
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:08,820
What would you like me to say?

1187
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:11,700
That if you don't want
to die, remember to knock?

1188
01:20:13,060 --> 01:20:15,580
- That's not fair.
- What is?

1189
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:34,460
Bad news.

1190
01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:38,820
Emilio was shot this morning.

1191
01:20:40,540 --> 01:20:43,020
Is he dead?

1192
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:46,900
- Yes, baby, he's dead.
- Oh, no.

1193
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:37,260
Yo! Listen up. Miss Johnson
got something to say!

1194
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:40,660
- Shh.
- Thank you.

1195
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:44,060
I just want to say...

1196
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:47,180
I, uh... I won't, um...

1197
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:52,340
I will not be here next year.

1198
01:21:52,460 --> 01:21:54,300
I'm not coming back.

1199
01:21:55,780 --> 01:21:58,060
How come? Is it something we did?

1200
01:21:58,140 --> 01:22:00,820
No. No, no, no. No. Um...

1201
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:05,820
l-I never intended to stay.

1202
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:08,540
Um, this was an unexpected job.

1203
01:22:08,660 --> 01:22:12,500
So if you knew you wasn't gonna stay, how
come you made me promise what I promised?

1204
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:15,740
L...

1205
01:22:17,660 --> 01:22:20,660
At that time, I thought I would stay.

1206
01:22:20,740 --> 01:22:22,740
So how come you're leaving?

1207
01:22:24,700 --> 01:22:26,540
I just...

1208
01:22:27,820 --> 01:22:30,260
have my reasons, certain reasons.

1209
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:34,340
Is it because it's too sad for
you, what happened to Emilio?

1210
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:49,900
Maybe.

1211
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:52,500
And Durrell and Lionel
and Callie. And I just...

1212
01:22:52,620 --> 01:22:54,460
I just think that...

1213
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:02,300
So if you love us so much and you're
so interested in our graduating,

1214
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:05,300
- how come you choose to leave?
- Yeah.

1215
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:10,100
You sad about Durrell and Callie and
Emilio and Lionel, but we're here.

1216
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:13,700
What about us, huh? None
of us make you feel happy?

1217
01:23:13,820 --> 01:23:18,260
We been working hard and we stayed
in school, man. What about us?

1218
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:20,500
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1219
01:23:35,020 --> 01:23:38,180
Why are you packing up today
when tomorrow is your last day?

1220
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:41,140
Oh, just gettin' a head start.

1221
01:23:42,540 --> 01:23:44,420
Oh, I see.

1222
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:52,660
What you did, when you
gave me the 200 dollars?

1223
01:23:55,260 --> 01:24:00,340
That was the nicest thing
anybody ever did for me.

1224
01:24:00,420 --> 01:24:02,780
I don't know anybody else
who would give 200 dollars...

1225
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:05,460
to a Mexican kid on his word of honor.

1226
01:24:11,140 --> 01:24:13,500
S-So you gotta let me pay you back.

1227
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:20,060
Even if I don't graduate, all right?

1228
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:22,780
Why wouldn't you graduate?

1229
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:27,300
Ain't no other teacher
gonna give me no "A."

1230
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:30,020
Yes, they will, if you work for
them the way you worked for me.

1231
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:32,540
No, but it was different with you.
You gave me an "A" to start with.

1232
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:36,940
- I didn't have to earn it. I just had to keep it.
- Are you kidding?

1233
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:41,420
Keeping an "A" is harder than getting an
"A." Almost anyone can get an "A" once.

1234
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:44,500
But keeping it, that's
an accomplishment.

1235
01:24:44,620 --> 01:24:47,420
- You think so?
- Oh, I know so.

1236
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:50,100
Do you realize the
work you did this term?

1237
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:53,700
Do you realize that the
poetry that we read...

1238
01:24:53,820 --> 01:24:55,700
is given to people in college?

1239
01:24:55,820 --> 01:24:57,980
- In college.
- These same poems?

1240
01:24:58,060 --> 01:25:01,300
- Yes.
- But they weren't even so hard.

1241
01:25:01,380 --> 01:25:03,260
So, you see?

1242
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:07,620
Keep working.

1243
01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:10,020
You'll graduate.

1244
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:15,380
I might even see you in college.

1245
01:25:15,460 --> 01:25:17,300
What do you think?

1246
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:36,780
I feel so bad about leaving
I can hardly breathe.

1247
01:25:36,860 --> 01:25:40,820
I know, but... Oh, what
the hell. You're right.

1248
01:25:40,940 --> 01:25:45,340
You gotta be crazy to stay here
and teach these programmed classes.

1249
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:48,020
There's no money. It's killer work.

1250
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:52,620
Why do you stay?

1251
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:55,100
Why do I smoke? I'm crazy.

1252
01:25:55,220 --> 01:25:57,140
You need any more help?

1253
01:25:57,220 --> 01:25:59,420
No. Thanks. I'll see you tomorrow.

1254
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:01,340
Yeah. Bye.

1255
01:26:03,140 --> 01:26:06,100
<i>This is the life</i>

1256
01:26:06,180 --> 01:26:09,980
<i>Everyone has to be somewhere</i>

1257
01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:14,900
<i>Oh</i>

1258
01:26:14,980 --> 01:26:20,660
<i>I am here</i>

1259
01:26:23,260 --> 01:26:24,540
<i>This is the life</i>

1260
01:26:24,540 --> 01:26:27,260
<i>This is the life</i>

1261
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:29,940
<i>This is the life</i>

1262
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:35,340
<i>'Cause this is my life</i>

1263
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:40,660
<i>This is my life</i>

1264
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:43,940
Hi.

1265
01:26:46,620 --> 01:26:50,580
Well. Welcome back.

1266
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:54,420
This is the 29th day, the
last day I have to come back.

1267
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:57,580
So, am I still okay for next term?

1268
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:00,540
Yeah.

1269
01:27:02,340 --> 01:27:04,660
Did, uh,

1270
01:27:04,740 --> 01:27:08,580
did you come back because it was
your last day or did somebody...

1271
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:11,860
ask you to come today
to talk me into staying?

1272
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:14,660
Well, it was both, really.

1273
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:19,060
See, 'cause I wasn't really
sure what I wanted to do...

1274
01:27:19,140 --> 01:27:21,980
until I heard that
you were leaving and...

1275
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:24,540
'Cause up until then, I
don't know, I thought...

1276
01:27:24,660 --> 01:27:27,980
that you'd always be
here for me, you know.

1277
01:27:28,060 --> 01:27:30,300
You know, whenever I came back.

1278
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:34,100
But then Raul tells me
that you're leaving...

1279
01:27:34,180 --> 01:27:36,020
just like that.

1280
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:41,740
And I realized that
this was my last chance.

1281
01:27:43,740 --> 01:27:45,740
And I decided...

1282
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:49,940
We decided that...

1283
01:27:50,020 --> 01:27:52,260
we're not gonna just
let you leave like that.

1284
01:27:54,940 --> 01:27:57,460
Yeah, we realized like the poem said:

1285
01:27:57,540 --> 01:28:00,220
You can't give in.

1286
01:28:00,340 --> 01:28:02,500
"You can't go gentle.

1287
01:28:02,620 --> 01:28:06,580
- You got to rage against the dying of the light."
- Yeah.

1288
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:08,860
Yeah, you gotta go for
yours. You know that, right?

1289
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:11,900
- Yeah.
- You gotta kick it in and get it up.

1290
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:15,220
Wait a minute, wait a minute. No,
no. Wait, wait. I'm not giving in.

1291
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:18,740
Um, this is my choice.

1292
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:22,060
I have no reason to "rage
against the dying of the light."

1293
01:28:22,140 --> 01:28:25,020
'Cause you're not the one who's
raging. We're the ones who are raging.

1294
01:28:25,140 --> 01:28:27,380
See, 'cause we see
you as being our light.

1295
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:33,180
- What?
- You're our Tambourine Man.

1296
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:38,020
- Oh, I'm your drug dealer?
- You got the stuff, Miss J?

1297
01:28:38,140 --> 01:28:42,020
You're our teacher. You got what
we need. It's the same thing.

1298
01:28:42,140 --> 01:28:45,820
Come on, Miss J. All the poems you
taught us say you can't give in.

1299
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:48,140
You can't give up.

1300
01:28:48,220 --> 01:28:51,020
- Well, we ain't giving you up.
- No way.

1301
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:55,380
Now, listen, baby, we gonna have to
tie you down to the chair and gag you...

1302
01:28:55,460 --> 01:29:00,300
'cause you know we want you to stay.

1303
01:29:00,380 --> 01:29:04,940
What you need to stay,
girl? You want a candy bar?

1304
01:29:05,020 --> 01:29:09,380
Okay, on the left and on the right,
a "Louanne, Louanne." Uh, here we go.

1305
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:12,740
Louanne, Louanne, Louanne, Louanne.

1306
01:29:12,860 --> 01:29:16,180
- Louanne, Louanne, Louanne, Louanne.
- Come on!

1307
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:20,660
Louanne, Louanne, Louanne, Louanne.

1308
01:29:25,620 --> 01:29:29,780
- You have to go first. - I don't want
to go first. - Come on. You have to.

1309
01:29:29,860 --> 01:29:31,700
Ready? You go like this. Go.

1310
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:36,220
- It go like this.
- This how you do it.

1311
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:40,140
Go, Louanne. Go, Louanne.
Go, Louanne. Go, Louanne.

1312
01:29:40,220 --> 01:29:43,220
Go, Louanne. Go, Louanne. Go, Louanne.

1313
01:29:49,540 --> 01:29:52,220
Let me see.

1314
01:29:52,340 --> 01:29:55,220
- Excuse me. - Are
you okay? - Yeah.

1315
01:29:57,820 --> 01:30:00,580
- You want to sign my book?
- Yeah, I'll sign your book.

1316
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:26,780
How'd they get you to come back?

1317
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:30,420
They gave me candy and
called me "the light."

1318
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:31,460
That'll do it.

1319
01:31:00,220 --> 01:31:02,540
<i>I won't do you wrong</i>

1320
01:31:02,620 --> 01:31:04,900
<i>I'll do you right</i>

1321
01:31:05,020 --> 01:31:09,740
<i>You can roll with me
for the rest of the night</i>

1322
01:31:09,820 --> 01:31:14,020
<i>No need to fuss 'cause
I don't wanna joke</i>

1323
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:17,940
<i>Baby, sit right here
and let the chronic smoke</i>

1324
01:31:18,060 --> 01:31:20,860
<i>So hang around, love</i>

1325
01:31:20,980 --> 01:31:23,740
<i>And give it up</i>

1326
01:31:23,820 --> 01:31:28,020
<i>'Cause all the real "G"s
know what I'm thinkin'of</i>

1327
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:33,460
<i>'Cause you wanna be
down, down so give it up</i>

1328
01:31:33,580 --> 01:31:37,460
<i>There's a party over here
So, baby, show your love</i>

1329
01:31:37,540 --> 01:31:41,620
