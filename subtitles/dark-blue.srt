00:40:09,928 --> 00:40:11,997
Hey, Billy?

969
00:40:12,031 --> 00:40:13,500
Wow.

970
00:40:13,534 --> 00:40:14,702
If I knew you were coming,

971
00:40:14,736 --> 00:40:16,705
I would have put on
a more revealing gown.

972
00:40:16,739 --> 00:40:18,841
Too bad he didn't shoot you
in the mouth.

973

[ Chuckles ]

974
00:40:20,745 --> 00:40:23,082
Baby girl, uh,
give us a couple minutes?

975
00:40:23,116 --> 00:40:24,651
Please?

976
00:40:24,685 --> 00:40:25,953
Thank you.

977
00:40:25,988 --> 00:40:27,488
[ Siren wails in distance ]

978
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,828
You're actually
pretty brave...

979
00:40:30,862 --> 00:40:32,163
For a coward.

980
00:40:32,197 --> 00:40:34,934
Rowe confessed to the murder,
told us where the body is.

981
00:40:34,968 --> 00:40:36,336
So, like it or not,

982
00:40:36,371 --> 00:40:38,373
you actually did a pretty good
thing here, Billy.

983
00:40:41,512 --> 00:40:43,815
Uh...Um...

984
00:40:45,451 --> 00:40:47,588
...Mozza.

985
00:40:47,622 --> 00:40:49,558
You and me...

986
00:40:49,592 --> 00:40:50,927
Saturday.

987
00:40:52,597 --> 00:40:53,697
I'll take that as a yes.

988
00:41:02,947 --> 00:41:04,882
You have the key?

989
00:41:04,916 --> 00:41:06,284
Yep.

990
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:10,925
Too bad.

991
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,595
[ Chuckles ]

992
00:41:17,303 --> 00:41:18,705
So...

993
00:41:18,739 --> 00:41:21,675
How we doin'?

994
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:23,044
What do you mean?

995
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:24,647
Us.

996
00:41:24,681 --> 00:41:26,884
The first week together.

997
00:41:26,918 --> 00:41:28,319
Oh. Right. "Us."
Yeah.

998
00:41:28,354 --> 00:41:31,591
I'd say we did
pretty good.

999
00:41:31,626 --> 00:41:33,896
Me too.

1000
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:36,099
But like we talked about,

1001
00:41:36,133 --> 00:41:38,435
the key is being open
and honest.

1002
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:40,673
No secrets.

1003
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:43,310
Absolutely.

1004
00:41:43,344 --> 00:41:45,381
No secrets here.

1005
00:41:47,285 --> 00:41:48,753
You?

1006
00:41:48,787 --> 00:41:50,856
Nope.

1007
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:53,092
Oh, good.
