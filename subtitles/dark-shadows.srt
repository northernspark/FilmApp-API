00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:51,502
<i>It is said that blood
is thicker than water.</i>

3
00:00:51,669 --> 00:00:53,629
<i>It is what defines us.</i>

4
00:00:53,796 --> 00:00:56,465
<i>Binds us. Curses us.</i>

5
00:00:56,632 --> 00:00:58,175
Come, my love. Let's go.

6
00:00:58,342 --> 00:00:59,426
Come, Barnabas.

7
00:01:00,344 --> 00:01:05,724
<i>For some, blood means a life
of wealth and privilege.</i>

8
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:08,310
<i>For others, a life of servitude.</i>

9
00:01:09,228 --> 00:01:13,357
Angelique, how many times
do I have to tell you not to stare at him?

10
00:01:13,524 --> 00:01:15,276
Remember your place.

11
00:01:17,653 --> 00:01:19,405
<i>When I was but a boy...</i>

12
00:01:19,572 --> 00:01:24,326
<i>my father took us to the New World
to expand the Collins family empire.</i>

13
00:01:24,493 --> 00:01:27,913
<i>We brought English industry
to the wilds of Maine...</i>

14
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,499
<i>and built a fishing business...</i>

15
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:33,460
<i>the likes of which America had never seen.</i>

16
00:01:35,337 --> 00:01:38,007
A man should take pride in what he builds.

17
00:01:38,924 --> 00:01:43,972
But remember, Barnabas,
family is the only real wealth.

18
00:01:48,392 --> 00:01:53,647
<i>As our business grew,
the town of Collinsport grew with it...</i>

19
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:57,443
<i>and we decided to put down permanent roots.</i>

20
00:02:04,116 --> 00:02:08,871
<i>We spent the next 15 years
building our beloved home:</i>

21
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,206
<i>Collin wood.</i>

22
00:02:16,045 --> 00:02:20,716
<i>But not everyone shared
in our family's success.</i>

23
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,514
Let me hear you say
"I love you, Angelique. I want you."

24
00:02:33,562 --> 00:02:34,855
Angelique...

25
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:37,024
I am sorry, my dear...

26
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:40,069
but you would be hearing a lie.

27
00:02:45,074 --> 00:02:47,618
<i>Make the high and mighty low</i>

28
00:02:47,785 --> 00:02:51,163
<i>Arrogant creatures, down you go</i>

29
00:03:07,763 --> 00:03:10,766
<i>Convinced my parents' death was no accident...</i>

30
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:15,312
<i>I became obsessed with dark magic
and ancient curses.</i>

31
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:18,607
"Lo! Above the gates of hell...

32
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:22,277
he found a single letter.

33
00:03:23,278 --> 00:03:25,614
A letter proclaiming Satan's true name.

34
00:03:27,282 --> 00:03:29,201
Mephistopheles."

35
00:03:31,495 --> 00:03:36,792
<i>But even then, in the depths of my grief,
not all was darkness.</i>

36
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:40,546
<i>For I had found my one true love.</i>

37
00:03:41,505 --> 00:03:43,298
Promise we'll be together forever.

38
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:46,593
God as my witness, Josette...

39
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,762
I swear it.

40
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,981
<i>Of all the servants I could have spurned...</i>

41
00:03:59,356 --> 00:04:01,233
<i>all the hearts I could have broken</i>

42
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,778
<i>I got the one with the secret.</i>

43
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:07,448
<i>I got the witch.</i>

44
00:04:08,073 --> 00:04:10,617
<i>If he doth another choose</i>

45
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:13,412
<i>To lend his heart an eye</i>

46
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:16,957
<i>Then magic shall the slighted use</i>

47
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:20,085
<i>So all he loves will</i>

48
00:04:21,336 --> 00:04:22,921
<i>Die</i>

49
00:04:24,673 --> 00:04:26,175
<i>Caught in Angelique's spell...</i>

50
00:04:26,341 --> 00:04:29,386
<i>my beloved Josette wandered helplessly
towards Widow's Hill...</i>

51
00:04:29,553 --> 00:04:33,599
<i>where many a despondent soul
had leapt to their death.</i>

52
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,521
Josette!

53
00:04:49,865 --> 00:04:51,408
Josette!

54
00:05:06,381 --> 00:05:08,217
Josette.

55
00:05:13,055 --> 00:05:14,681
Help me.

56
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:48,423
Josette!

57
00:06:38,307 --> 00:06:40,809
What have you done?!

58
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:50,485
<i>Angelique had cursed me to be a vampire...</i>

59
00:06:50,652 --> 00:06:54,239
<i>so that my suffering would never end.</i>

60
00:07:12,841 --> 00:07:14,259
There's the monster.

61
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,935
<i>Resolved that I would never belong to her...</i>

62
00:07:23,101 --> 00:07:25,520
<i>Angelique turned the townspeople against me...</i>

63
00:07:25,687 --> 00:07:29,775
<i>and condemned me to suffer my anguish
alone in the dark...</i>

64
00:07:29,942 --> 00:07:30,984
Let me out!

65
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:32,277
<i>for all time.</i>

66
00:07:32,444 --> 00:07:34,821
Let me out, I say!

67
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,492
Release me!

68
00:08:46,601 --> 00:08:49,271
Hello. My name is Maggie Ev--

69
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:01,533
Hello. My name is Victoria Winters.

70
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,161
Please, call me Vicky.

71
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:52,000
So where are you from, Veronica?

72
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:55,087
New York. And it's Victoria.

73
00:09:55,253 --> 00:09:59,132
"And it's Victoria."
I love this chick, man.

74
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:01,468
New York's a trip, huh?

75
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:02,928
I guess.

76
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:07,015
What about you?

77
00:10:07,182 --> 00:10:10,268
What brings a New York girl
out to the sticks?

78
00:10:13,188 --> 00:10:15,315
An old friend.

79
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:05,323
- Be cool.
- Have a nice day.

80
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:10,078
- Catch you later.
- Take it easy, Veronica.

81
00:12:30,325 --> 00:12:32,661
Hello. I'm Victoria Winters.

82
00:12:32,827 --> 00:12:34,162
Congratulations.

83
00:12:35,163 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm here to see Ms. Stoddard
about the governess position.

84
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:42,087
Oh, yeah. Been expecting you.

85
00:12:42,545 --> 00:12:43,588
Come on.

86
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,509
Sorry I didn't grab you
down at the station.

87
00:12:47,676 --> 00:12:49,469
Damn wagon's been acting up.

88
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:53,056
Miss Elizabeth won't spend the money
to get her fixed.

89
00:12:53,556 --> 00:12:54,599
It's beautiful.

90
00:12:55,517 --> 00:12:57,852
A bitch to dust is what it is.

91
00:12:59,104 --> 00:13:01,856
This place was designed
for a staff of a hundred.

92
00:13:02,023 --> 00:13:03,275
Now they got a staff of me.

93
00:13:04,276 --> 00:13:06,319
Me and Mrs. Johnson.

94
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:09,614
She's about as useful
as a bucket without a bottom.

95
00:13:09,781 --> 00:13:14,035
Still, not every family
has a house like this.

96
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:16,538
Or a whole town named after them.

97
00:13:17,038 --> 00:13:18,206
Come again?

98
00:13:18,707 --> 00:13:20,542
Collins. "Collinsport."

99
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:23,628
Never got that.

100
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:25,714
Who's that?

101
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,550
Barnaby, maybe.

102
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,885
Something with a "Barn" in it.

103
00:13:31,052 --> 00:13:33,138
One of the real important ones from way back.

104
00:13:33,972 --> 00:13:36,558
Back when they were rich, rich people.

105
00:13:36,725 --> 00:13:38,435
Barnabas.

106
00:13:39,144 --> 00:13:42,063
His name was Barnabas Collins.

107
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:45,066
And he was the finest man
this family ever knew.

108
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:48,236
Welcome to Collinwood.

109
00:13:48,403 --> 00:13:51,072
You'll have to imagine us on a better day.

110
00:13:52,324 --> 00:13:54,409
The house has some 200 rooms...

111
00:13:54,576 --> 00:13:57,746
most closed off to save on heating.

112
00:13:58,788 --> 00:14:02,500
We don't even go in the old wing anymore.

113
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,377
Sit.

114
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:07,213
There are only seven of us, after all.

115
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,382
My daughter, Carolyn, and I.

116
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:11,843
My brother, Roger, and his son, David.

117
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:15,513
Willie, who you've met.

118
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,767
Mrs. Johnson and Dr. Hoffman...

119
00:14:18,933 --> 00:14:23,563
who I suspect is sleeping off
one of her legendary hangovers.

120
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,608
And where is David's mother,
if you don't mind my asking?

121
00:14:29,694 --> 00:14:32,072
Laura was lost at sea...

122
00:14:33,114 --> 00:14:34,532
when David was 5.

123
00:14:35,533 --> 00:14:40,288
He's had a rather difficult time
accepting her passing.

124
00:14:41,664 --> 00:14:45,293
I brought Dr. Hoffman here
to work with him for a month.

125
00:14:48,213 --> 00:14:50,340
That was three years ago.

126
00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:55,428
There are just a few questions,
if you don't mind...

127
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,972
that were not on the application.

128
00:14:58,598 --> 00:14:59,808
Of course.

129
00:15:03,812 --> 00:15:06,064
How do you feel about the president?

130
00:15:06,231 --> 00:15:07,273
Never met him.

131
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:12,278
The war?

132
00:15:12,821 --> 00:15:14,239
I don't watch television.

133
00:15:16,074 --> 00:15:18,243
Do you think the sexes should be equal?

134
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:20,328
Heavens, no.

135
00:15:20,495 --> 00:15:22,414
Men would become unmanageable.

136
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:27,043
I think we'll get along just fine,
Ms. Winters.

137
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:30,255
Vicky. Please, call me Vicky.

138
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:36,177
Carolyn.

139
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:41,516
Carolyn, this is Ms. Winters.

140
00:15:41,683 --> 00:15:45,562
<i>Sick of hanging around your pad</i>

141
00:15:46,271 --> 00:15:47,355
You're from New York?

142
00:15:48,231 --> 00:15:49,274
I am.

143
00:15:50,108 --> 00:15:51,818
What's Manhattan like?

144
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:53,695
I'm going to live there when I'm 16.

145
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:57,532
Carolyn has a fantasy
that I'm going to allow this.

146
00:15:57,699 --> 00:16:01,202
And Mother has a fantasy
I won't run away if she doesn't.

147
00:16:01,703 --> 00:16:03,872
So you're here to babysit the loony.

148
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:06,541
What have I told you about using that word?

149
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,835
I'm here to teach David.

150
00:16:09,294 --> 00:16:10,378
Good luck.

151
00:16:10,545 --> 00:16:13,047
None of the others have made it past a week.

152
00:16:14,215 --> 00:16:15,383
Ms. Winters.

153
00:16:16,217 --> 00:16:18,178
Please, call me Vicky.

154
00:16:37,155 --> 00:16:39,407
Chop-chop, Willie, I'm starving.

155
00:16:40,909 --> 00:16:43,745
And God help me if it's
another bone-dry pot roast--

156
00:16:45,246 --> 00:16:46,372
Who's this?

157
00:16:46,998 --> 00:16:49,250
Ms. Winters, this is my brother, Roger.

158
00:16:50,168 --> 00:16:52,879
Roger, Ms. Winters is to be
David's new governess.

159
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,547
Please, call me Vicky.

160
00:16:55,632 --> 00:16:57,091
It's nice to meet you.

161
00:16:57,258 --> 00:17:01,554
Yeah. Yeah. Nice to meet you.

162
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,725
<i>That it's strange</i>

163
00:17:06,476 --> 00:17:08,228
You're a liar.

164
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:13,608
I can tell, you know.
Just from a person's face.

165
00:17:14,025 --> 00:17:16,110
Yours says:

166
00:17:16,986 --> 00:17:20,198
"I might look sweet and innocent,
but I have secrets.

167
00:17:20,532 --> 00:17:23,451
Secrets that'll make the hairs on your arms
stand straight up."

168
00:17:23,618 --> 00:17:24,869
Leave her be, Julia.

169
00:17:26,788 --> 00:17:27,956
You're the doctor.

170
00:17:28,623 --> 00:17:31,543
Yeah. And you're "the nanny,"
and she's "the bitch."

171
00:17:32,961 --> 00:17:35,171
How do you ever expect us girls to advance...

172
00:17:35,338 --> 00:17:37,966
if we keep reducing each other to labels?

173
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,928
So, Vicky, where'd you c--?

174
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:45,306
Carolyn!
Will you please turn that noise down?

175
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:10,665
David, this is Vicky.

176
00:18:11,249 --> 00:18:13,751
She's going to be your new governess.

177
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:14,961
You ruined it!

178
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:17,171
I was gonna scare her.

179
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,967
Damn it. What have I told you
about cutting holes in the sheets?

180
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:22,677
Those are Egyptian cotton.

181
00:18:23,678 --> 00:18:25,346
I was gonna scare you.

182
00:18:25,513 --> 00:18:26,723
Were you scared?

183
00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:28,308
Terrified beyond belief.

184
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:33,521
You don't have to be nice to him
just because he's nuts, you know.

185
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:35,523
Carolyn....

186
00:18:35,732 --> 00:18:38,776
Carolyn touches herself.
She makes noises like a kitten.

187
00:18:38,943 --> 00:18:41,195
- David.
- You little shit.

188
00:18:41,362 --> 00:18:43,031
Carolyn. Enough, both of you.

189
00:18:47,869 --> 00:18:50,705
If I may, what is the family business?

190
00:18:50,872 --> 00:18:55,710
Seafood, Ms. Winters.
We had a large cannery in town.

191
00:18:55,877 --> 00:18:57,879
We still own a few fishing boats.

192
00:18:58,046 --> 00:19:00,256
Rusty old boats that no one will hire.

193
00:19:00,423 --> 00:19:02,842
And David's mother's at the bottom
with one of them.

194
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:04,677
Carolyn, go to your room.

195
00:19:08,723 --> 00:19:12,060
Everybody in this house tiptoes around him,
but no one cares how I feel!

196
00:19:18,566 --> 00:19:20,318
She didn't die.

197
00:19:20,985 --> 00:19:22,820
- She can't.
- Enough, David.

198
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:27,033
Yes, David believes his mother
has some kind of...

199
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,410
cyclical immortality.

200
00:19:29,577 --> 00:19:31,204
Fascinating, really.

201
00:19:31,829 --> 00:19:33,581
I feel her.

202
00:19:34,332 --> 00:19:35,416
She talks to me.

203
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,585
All the time.

204
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:40,546
Well...

205
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:43,091
I think ghosts are just people...

206
00:19:43,257 --> 00:19:46,094
who've moved into a slightly
different dimension than ours.

207
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,972
And I think some people just have antennas
strong enough to pick them up.

208
00:19:52,016 --> 00:19:54,268
There's actually scientific evidence to support--

209
00:19:54,435 --> 00:19:55,937
Thank you, Ms. Winters.

210
00:20:09,325 --> 00:20:12,036
David, you startled me.

211
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,373
Getting ready for Halloween?

212
00:20:39,689 --> 00:20:41,524
He's coming.

213
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,352
He's coming.

214
00:21:42,376 --> 00:21:43,669
We hit something.

215
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:45,713
Let's dig it out.

216
00:21:50,051 --> 00:21:51,135
Get down here.

217
00:21:56,766 --> 00:21:58,392
What the hell is this?

218
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,686
Think it's a gas main?

219
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:03,189
Not supposed to be any out here.

220
00:22:05,608 --> 00:22:08,986
You've gotta be shitting me.
Grab me some bolt cutters.

221
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,091
Jesus!

222
00:22:34,512 --> 00:22:35,763
Run!

223
00:23:06,586 --> 00:23:08,629
I am terribly sorry.

224
00:23:08,796 --> 00:23:12,091
You cannot imagine how thirsty I am.

225
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,321
Mephistopheles.

226
00:23:47,084 --> 00:23:48,669
Show yourself, Satan!

227
00:23:48,836 --> 00:23:51,797
Mock me not with your strange luminance!

228
00:24:16,614 --> 00:24:18,616
Curious terrain.

229
00:24:25,206 --> 00:24:27,041
What is this?

230
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:29,627
Some specter approaches.

231
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:33,798
It is the eyes of the devil himself,
come to drag me to my judgment.

232
00:24:36,717 --> 00:24:38,552
Have at me, Lucifer.

233
00:24:38,761 --> 00:24:40,346
My soul is prepared!

234
00:24:45,226 --> 00:24:46,560
Asshole!

235
00:26:13,355 --> 00:26:15,149
My beloved Collinwood.

236
00:26:15,983 --> 00:26:18,277
What have they done to you?

237
00:26:28,579 --> 00:26:31,582
<i>I'll keep on drinking and trust my--</i>

238
00:26:31,832 --> 00:26:33,959
Hi, pumpkin.

239
00:26:37,088 --> 00:26:38,506
Fear me not, drunkard.

240
00:26:39,423 --> 00:26:40,966
You shall not be harmed...

241
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:43,928
so long as you tell me
all that I need to know.

242
00:26:46,388 --> 00:26:48,182
Well, here's all you need to know.

243
00:26:49,892 --> 00:26:51,852
See me, derelict.

244
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,523
Look into my eyes...

245
00:26:55,689 --> 00:26:59,693
and deliver me your innermost thoughts.

246
00:27:05,866 --> 00:27:07,451
Awaken.

247
00:27:08,035 --> 00:27:09,662
Well done.

248
00:27:09,912 --> 00:27:12,832
Now, tell me, the Collins family...

249
00:27:13,749 --> 00:27:15,126
do they endure?

250
00:27:16,943 --> 00:27:18,295
There's four of them.

251
00:27:18,796 --> 00:27:20,548
Thank heaven.

252
00:27:20,714 --> 00:27:23,134
Pray, what month is it?

253
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,637
October. That's why there's pumpkins.

254
00:27:26,804 --> 00:27:29,807
- What is the year?
- '72.

255
00:27:29,974 --> 00:27:32,226
Wait. '71.

256
00:27:33,393 --> 00:27:35,062
1972.

257
00:27:36,397 --> 00:27:38,941
1972?

258
00:27:40,943 --> 00:27:42,570
Hear me, future-dweller.

259
00:27:43,904 --> 00:27:46,031
You shall be my loyal servant...

260
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:51,370
until such time as I release you.

261
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,250
So, what first, master?

262
00:27:56,417 --> 00:27:59,253
You will cleanse me, miscreant.

263
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:02,423
And then you will take me
to these living Collinses you speak of.

264
00:28:03,132 --> 00:28:04,675
Okay.

265
00:28:13,475 --> 00:28:17,188
Have you ever seen such majesty?

266
00:28:17,354 --> 00:28:18,439
Every day.

267
00:28:18,814 --> 00:28:22,234
The perfect marriage of European elegance...

268
00:28:22,776 --> 00:28:25,362
and American enterprise.

269
00:28:27,948 --> 00:28:33,412
Nine of the finest craftsmen
the world will ever know...

270
00:28:33,954 --> 00:28:38,292
lost digit, limb and life...

271
00:28:38,459 --> 00:28:42,129
in the process of carving
these glorious pillars.

272
00:28:43,672 --> 00:28:47,885
And they all considered it
worth the sacrifice, I assure you.

273
00:28:48,844 --> 00:28:53,390
The opulence and complexity
of this magnificent chandelier...

274
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,479
should only be found
in the palaces of nobility.

275
00:29:00,147 --> 00:29:02,066
The fireplace...

276
00:29:02,733 --> 00:29:07,655
sculpted entirely of the most
exquisite Carrara marble...

277
00:29:07,821 --> 00:29:10,783
from <i>Firenze, Italia...</i>

278
00:29:11,408 --> 00:29:16,497
each joint containing a single pearl.

279
00:29:21,752 --> 00:29:23,462
Are you stoned or something?

280
00:29:25,172 --> 00:29:27,633
They tried stoning me, my dear.

281
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,093
It did not work.

282
00:29:31,553 --> 00:29:34,640
When did they start allowing
women of the night on estate grounds?

283
00:29:35,182 --> 00:29:36,433
Carolyn.

284
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:39,853
- Look.
- Yes.

285
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,022
Uncanny, is it not?

286
00:29:42,189 --> 00:29:44,775
Worth every hour I spent posing.

287
00:29:44,942 --> 00:29:49,780
Forgive me.
My name is Barnabas Collins.

288
00:29:50,239 --> 00:29:53,325
I'm David Collins.

289
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:55,911
- Are we--?
- Related?

290
00:29:56,078 --> 00:29:57,621
Distantly, you might say.

291
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:02,710
It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance,
Master David.

292
00:30:02,876 --> 00:30:04,336
Children!

293
00:30:04,878 --> 00:30:06,338
Get away from that man.

294
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:09,466
He says his name is Barnabas Collins.

295
00:30:09,717 --> 00:30:11,677
And I'm pretty sure he called me a hooker.

296
00:30:12,636 --> 00:30:14,596
That'll do, Carolyn.

297
00:30:17,766 --> 00:30:19,727
A word, please.

298
00:30:22,229 --> 00:30:25,983
If this is some kind of a joke,
consider it played.

299
00:30:26,483 --> 00:30:30,321
If it's money you're after,
I'm afraid you've been misinformed.

300
00:30:30,487 --> 00:30:34,199
But whoever you are, you're not to look
at those children again. Am I clear?

301
00:30:38,537 --> 00:30:41,999
Your devotion to family...

302
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:44,752
is admirable, madam.

303
00:30:44,918 --> 00:30:46,128
And your suspicion...

304
00:30:47,796 --> 00:30:49,506
understandable.

305
00:30:51,175 --> 00:30:53,344
A stranger arrives...

306
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:56,930
claiming to be a distant relation.

307
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:00,726
The question of motive is to be expected.

308
00:31:05,272 --> 00:31:06,607
As a Collins...

309
00:31:07,941 --> 00:31:13,072
surely you are aware of the darkness
that has long plagued our family.

310
00:31:14,198 --> 00:31:16,867
You mean our curse.

311
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:21,663
Witches, ghosts and vampires.

312
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:24,666
Myths.

313
00:31:26,293 --> 00:31:30,130
And like so many before you...

314
00:31:30,631 --> 00:31:32,883
I suppose you're here to rid us of them.

315
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:34,802
For a price, of course.

316
00:31:37,012 --> 00:31:40,183
I can prove that I am different.

317
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:44,603
Firstly, I do not come seeking money.

318
00:31:45,062 --> 00:31:47,272
Rather, to provide it.

319
00:31:48,023 --> 00:31:49,650
Secondly...

320
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:54,488
I know the body of this mansion
as well as I know my own.

321
00:31:55,531 --> 00:31:57,199
Every nook...

322
00:31:57,616 --> 00:31:59,660
every corner...

323
00:31:59,827 --> 00:32:02,162
every secret!

324
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:08,794
That's where I keep my macramé.

325
00:32:10,754 --> 00:32:12,923
A disgraceful misuse.

326
00:32:14,216 --> 00:32:15,884
Impressive.

327
00:32:17,803 --> 00:32:21,682
But there are plenty of old houses
with hidden doors.

328
00:32:22,182 --> 00:32:24,685
I hope you have a "thirdly."

329
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:26,687
Indeed.

330
00:32:27,187 --> 00:32:28,856
Tell me...

331
00:32:29,022 --> 00:32:30,816
what do you know...

332
00:32:31,525 --> 00:32:33,861
of Barnabas Collins?

333
00:32:34,027 --> 00:32:36,196
Just legends, really.

334
00:32:36,989 --> 00:32:39,450
He was confident and strong.

335
00:32:40,451 --> 00:32:42,369
Admired by all.

336
00:32:42,536 --> 00:32:44,913
But he believed our family was cursed...

337
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,584
and when his parents were killed,
he went mad.

338
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:53,797
Went around insisting that a witch
had turned him into a vampire.

339
00:32:54,715 --> 00:32:57,050
And what is known of his death?

340
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:59,011
Nothing.

341
00:32:59,595 --> 00:33:01,305
Not that I can think of.

342
00:33:01,472 --> 00:33:03,056
That, madam...

343
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:05,559
is because he never died.

344
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,832
I am Barnabas Collins.

345
00:33:34,254 --> 00:33:35,422
That means you're--

346
00:33:35,589 --> 00:33:38,967
A vampire, madam. Yes.

347
00:33:39,927 --> 00:33:41,345
And most regrettably so.

348
00:33:44,765 --> 00:33:48,519
But more importantly, I am a Collins.

349
00:33:48,977 --> 00:33:50,604
And I give you my word of honor:

350
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:58,070
Neither you nor any under this roof
need fear my cursed nature.

351
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:21,301
My father had quite a flair
for secret passages and rooms.

352
00:34:23,345 --> 00:34:28,350
As a boy, I took it upon myself
to discover each one.

353
00:34:28,517 --> 00:34:29,726
But this one....

354
00:34:29,893 --> 00:34:33,855
This one was always my favorite.

355
00:34:34,314 --> 00:34:40,195
"Family is the only real wealth,"
he would often remark.

356
00:34:41,697 --> 00:34:42,781
Though clearly...

357
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:47,536
he was not opposed to other kinds.

358
00:34:49,538 --> 00:34:51,498
Oh, my God.

359
00:34:52,374 --> 00:34:56,336
We've been sitting on top of a fortune
all these years.

360
00:34:59,006 --> 00:35:00,882
Know this:

361
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:03,385
I mean to stay.

362
00:35:04,845 --> 00:35:07,764
I mean to be a part of this family again.

363
00:35:08,724 --> 00:35:10,517
On one condition.

364
00:35:10,934 --> 00:35:12,185
Yes.

365
00:35:12,352 --> 00:35:14,563
Promise me that this...

366
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:18,609
all of this, will remain our secret.

367
00:35:20,527 --> 00:35:21,987
So be it.

368
00:35:24,197 --> 00:35:25,365
Partners.

369
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:34,958
Welcome home, Barnabas Collins.

370
00:35:37,586 --> 00:35:39,463
I was awakened...

371
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:43,550
by a yellow dragon with iron teeth.

372
00:35:43,884 --> 00:35:49,848
Confronted by a giant letter M
with the luminance of a thousand lanterns.

373
00:35:50,807 --> 00:35:52,809
He's not staying with us forever, is he?

374
00:35:54,144 --> 00:35:55,228
I like him.

375
00:35:55,812 --> 00:36:00,067
Yes, well, I'm sure things
are very different in England.

376
00:36:00,734 --> 00:36:04,696
So, Barnabas, what sort of business
are you in back home?

377
00:36:04,905 --> 00:36:09,242
The Collins family has always been
in the fishing business.

378
00:36:09,409 --> 00:36:11,495
But after two centuries of consideration...

379
00:36:11,662 --> 00:36:15,040
I have decided to devote
the entirety of my energies...

380
00:36:15,207 --> 00:36:18,210
to family.

381
00:36:18,919 --> 00:36:22,506
He means it seemed like two centuries.

382
00:36:24,257 --> 00:36:25,759
Morning.

383
00:36:30,263 --> 00:36:31,390
Who the hell is this?

384
00:36:32,349 --> 00:36:38,188
Dr. Hoffman, this is our distant relative,
Barnabas Collins.

385
00:36:38,772 --> 00:36:40,232
The Third.

386
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:44,569
Barnabas Collins III
is going to stay with us from England.

387
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:47,781
Barnabas? Dr. Julia Hoffman.

388
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,451
My God...

389
00:36:51,952 --> 00:36:54,246
a woman doctor.

390
00:36:54,663 --> 00:36:56,456
What an age this is.

391
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,793
Is he for real?

392
00:37:01,169 --> 00:37:03,630
I think he's just tired from his long trip.

393
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,426
I see that you have grown desperate enough...

394
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:10,303
to sell off the prized family silverware.

395
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,806
How could you tell?
These are exact replicas.

396
00:37:12,973 --> 00:37:15,308
Had this fork been real silver...

397
00:37:15,475 --> 00:37:20,439
my hand would have burst into flames
upon its slightest touch.

398
00:37:22,649 --> 00:37:26,778
Yes, you mentioned you have
a terrible metal allergy.

399
00:37:28,488 --> 00:37:31,867
Anyway, the fishing business
is all but gone.

400
00:37:32,033 --> 00:37:34,786
The manor is nearly in ruins.

401
00:37:35,412 --> 00:37:37,080
Well, I have returned.

402
00:37:37,247 --> 00:37:41,501
And in short order,
so shall our fortunes.

403
00:37:42,518 --> 00:37:43,670
Good luck.

404
00:37:43,837 --> 00:37:46,256
Angie has deals with most of the boats in Maine.

405
00:37:46,423 --> 00:37:48,341
- "Angie"?
- Angelbay.

406
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:52,471
They've taken just about every port
on the East Coast.

407
00:37:53,013 --> 00:37:56,183
Then that is where my work begins.
And with your blessing...

408
00:37:56,641 --> 00:38:00,687
I shall restore the family business
to its former glory.

409
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:05,233
Josette.

410
00:38:07,194 --> 00:38:08,361
That's Vicky.

411
00:38:08,779 --> 00:38:10,530
She believes in ghosts, like me.

412
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:17,871
Hi.

413
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,042
Enchanted.

414
00:38:22,209 --> 00:38:24,795
Surely you do not let them
call you "Vicky."

415
00:38:25,504 --> 00:38:28,840
A name like Victoria is so beautiful...

416
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:32,969
I could not bear to part
with a single syllable of it.

417
00:38:34,471 --> 00:38:35,889
Yeah, well...

418
00:38:36,556 --> 00:38:38,809
money might grow on trees
where you're from...

419
00:38:38,975 --> 00:38:41,478
but it's a little harder to come by here.

420
00:38:41,645 --> 00:38:43,688
Do not concern yourself with my methods.

421
00:38:44,064 --> 00:38:48,068
I should like to see the factory immediately.
How soon can the horses be ready?

422
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:50,821
We don't have horses.

423
00:38:51,571 --> 00:38:53,031
We have a Chevy.

424
00:38:57,577 --> 00:39:00,497
Hey, Angie, have a great day!

425
00:39:00,664 --> 00:39:03,542
- Morning, Angie!
- Hi, Angie!

426
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:05,418
Morning!

427
00:39:33,613 --> 00:39:38,410
One of the seamers blew a clutch.
It'll be two hours before it's back online.

428
00:39:38,577 --> 00:39:41,496
Make it an hour.
And start cracking the whip out here.

429
00:39:41,663 --> 00:39:44,291
Everybody looks like they're moving
at half speed today.

430
00:39:44,666 --> 00:39:48,587
Tell you the truth, I think they're
a little spooked about what happened last night.

431
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:50,463
- What do you mean?
- Didn't you hear?

432
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:53,842
They found 11 workers dead in the woods
off Route 9 this morning.

433
00:39:54,009 --> 00:39:55,302
Well, accidents happen.

434
00:39:55,468 --> 00:39:59,848
It wasn't an accident.
Some maniac ripped their throats out.

435
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:03,143
Where off Route 9?

436
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,152
Yeah, Helen, it's me.
Yeah, you heard me right. It's carnage here.

437
00:40:30,629 --> 00:40:33,798
All right! I heard you the first 20 times.

438
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:36,092
Keep your damn panties...

439
00:40:37,218 --> 00:40:40,013
- on.
- I'll do my best.

440
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,307
A word with Barnabas Collins, please.

441
00:40:42,474 --> 00:40:45,143
Oh, he's.... Who?

442
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:48,021
Oh, I think you know who.

443
00:40:48,188 --> 00:40:50,690
Black hair, handsome features.

444
00:40:50,857 --> 00:40:53,860
Strange clothes covered in fresh blood.

445
00:41:00,742 --> 00:41:06,164
My, we've let this place go to hell,
haven't we?

446
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:09,542
Right where it belongs.

447
00:41:17,217 --> 00:41:18,677
You must be Carolyn.

448
00:41:19,386 --> 00:41:21,179
<i>You're like a hungry tiger</i>

449
00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:24,808
We're growing into quite the fetching creature.

450
00:41:24,975 --> 00:41:26,184
Angelique.

451
00:41:26,726 --> 00:41:27,811
Elizabeth.

452
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:33,233
You're looking well.

453
00:41:34,067 --> 00:41:36,528
And to what do we owe the pleasure?

454
00:41:36,778 --> 00:41:41,992
I'm here on behalf of the town council
to welcome our new visitor to Collinsport.

455
00:41:42,951 --> 00:41:44,828
He's asleep, I'm afraid.

456
00:41:45,203 --> 00:41:48,164
During the day? How odd.

457
00:41:48,331 --> 00:41:51,710
What was that infernal banging?

458
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:53,712
Barnabas, we have a guest.

459
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:56,423
My apologies, madam.
I have just arisen.

460
00:41:56,965 --> 00:41:58,758
You must think me a fright. Miss....?

461
00:41:59,175 --> 00:42:00,427
Hello, Barnabas.

462
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:06,266
My name is Angie Bouchard.

463
00:42:07,434 --> 00:42:09,019
So it is.

464
00:42:11,271 --> 00:42:14,524
Do you know what I would very much like
to do with you?

465
00:42:15,316 --> 00:42:17,402
I can only imagine.

466
00:42:18,403 --> 00:42:21,614
I would very much like to have a word
in the drawing room.

467
00:42:21,781 --> 00:42:25,076
With your permission, Elizabeth.
Would you excuse us?

468
00:42:26,077 --> 00:42:29,831
How dare you defile my manor
with your noxious--?

469
00:42:40,091 --> 00:42:42,385
It's really you.

470
00:42:45,013 --> 00:42:48,641
How dare you place your wicked lips upon me?

471
00:42:48,975 --> 00:42:51,603
I remember this place being less depressing.

472
00:42:54,147 --> 00:42:58,193
I also remember the two of us
having a lot of fun.

473
00:42:58,359 --> 00:42:59,402
Here...

474
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,573
and...

475
00:43:05,825 --> 00:43:07,368
here.

476
00:43:07,535 --> 00:43:10,747
Have you any idea what you put me through?

477
00:43:10,914 --> 00:43:14,918
You killed the woman I love
and cursed me to be this hideous creature.

478
00:43:15,085 --> 00:43:16,836
Barnabas, get over it.

479
00:43:17,003 --> 00:43:19,839
Locked in a box for 200 years!

480
00:43:20,006 --> 00:43:24,177
Don't exaggerate, it was only 196.

481
00:43:24,344 --> 00:43:26,262
It was an eternity.

482
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,975
I shall have you tried for witchcraft
and burnt at the stake.

483
00:43:33,311 --> 00:43:35,522
Poor, sweet Barnabas.

484
00:43:35,688 --> 00:43:39,526
Things have changed
while you were taking your little nap.

485
00:43:40,443 --> 00:43:44,989
My Angelbay is Collinsport now.

486
00:43:45,156 --> 00:43:49,369
So you are the one who has sent
the Collins family business into the abyss.

487
00:43:49,536 --> 00:43:51,246
They love me here.

488
00:43:51,412 --> 00:43:54,958
I'm the only big fish left
in their little pond.

489
00:43:55,125 --> 00:43:56,835
Is that so?

490
00:43:57,001 --> 00:44:00,213
And do the good people of Collinsport
know that their beloved Angie...

491
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:02,215
is a whore of Beelzebub?

492
00:44:03,549 --> 00:44:06,886
Do you really think anyone
would believe a word you said?

493
00:44:07,053 --> 00:44:10,640
I've been an upstanding member
of this community for 200 years...

494
00:44:10,807 --> 00:44:13,309
in one form or another.

495
00:44:13,726 --> 00:44:18,940
Your name may have changed,
but you remain the succubus of Satan.

496
00:44:19,107 --> 00:44:21,151
Harlot of the devil. Vulgar--!

497
00:44:24,696 --> 00:44:27,407
The people of Collinsport
are my worshippers now.

498
00:44:27,824 --> 00:44:28,908
And to them...

499
00:44:29,075 --> 00:44:32,245
you're just a stranger
who's afraid of the sun.

500
00:44:35,456 --> 00:44:39,586
Welcome back to the shadows,
Barnabas Collins.

501
00:44:40,211 --> 00:44:41,921
I've missed you.

502
00:44:51,848 --> 00:44:53,600
Angelbay.

503
00:44:53,933 --> 00:44:58,271
The very audacity of the name
summons vomit into the recesses of my mouth.

504
00:44:58,438 --> 00:45:03,109
I always knew there was something off
about Angie. But a witch?

505
00:45:03,276 --> 00:45:04,903
Indeed.

506
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:08,781
But a witch with an impenetrable hatred of me.

507
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:10,366
Hate?

508
00:45:10,533 --> 00:45:13,912
No, if she merely hated you,
she would've killed you.

509
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:17,290
A curse takes devotion.

510
00:45:17,457 --> 00:45:18,917
Why must I alone...

511
00:45:19,292 --> 00:45:23,588
bear the rotten fruit
of our cursed family tree?

512
00:45:24,297 --> 00:45:27,300
My parents, taken.

513
00:45:30,637 --> 00:45:33,973
My true love, taken.

514
00:45:35,475 --> 00:45:36,893
And what did you do?

515
00:45:39,395 --> 00:45:42,482
I attempted to throw myself from a cliff.

516
00:45:42,649 --> 00:45:45,151
Tragically, to no avail.

517
00:45:45,652 --> 00:45:47,111
And then...

518
00:45:47,904 --> 00:45:50,323
I became a vampire...

519
00:45:50,949 --> 00:45:54,619
and started to kill innocent townspeople.

520
00:45:59,457 --> 00:46:01,000
Yes...

521
00:46:01,334 --> 00:46:04,963
but you also kept the family business afloat...

522
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:08,299
and tried to keep the manor
from falling apart.

523
00:46:10,176 --> 00:46:11,761
Yes.

524
00:46:12,053 --> 00:46:13,346
Yes, I did, didn't I?

525
00:46:13,513 --> 00:46:16,808
You fought on, Barnabas.

526
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:22,522
In your own crazy and miserable way,
you fought on...

527
00:46:22,689 --> 00:46:26,192
until they had to drag you away
and lock you in an iron box...

528
00:46:26,359 --> 00:46:29,028
- to keep you from fighting.
- My God, you're right.

529
00:46:29,195 --> 00:46:31,531
You fought on because it's in your blood.

530
00:46:31,698 --> 00:46:33,992
In our blood, madam.

531
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:37,203
And now you have a chance to fight again.

532
00:46:38,538 --> 00:46:41,916
And fight I shall.

533
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:35,446
<i>Just the same for you and me</i>

534
00:48:35,613 --> 00:48:39,992
<i>All I need will be mine if you are here</i>

535
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:42,745
<i>I'm on the top of the world looking down</i>

536
00:48:43,162 --> 00:48:46,416
What sorcery is this?

537
00:48:48,167 --> 00:48:51,295
Reveal yourself, tiny songstress!

538
00:49:56,944 --> 00:50:00,198
You want fishermen,
you gotta get Silas Clarney first.

539
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:03,618
He's got the ear of every captain
from Bar Harbor to Boston.

540
00:50:03,784 --> 00:50:06,913
They call him the
"Godfather of the Grand Banks."

541
00:50:07,747 --> 00:50:10,833
Excuse me. Captain Clarney?

542
00:50:14,795 --> 00:50:19,467
Captain Clarney,
I'd like you to meet Barnabas Collins.

543
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:22,762
"Collins"?

544
00:50:23,221 --> 00:50:27,266
And why does a Collins
want to talk to me?

545
00:50:33,564 --> 00:50:35,775
To offer you a contract.

546
00:50:35,942 --> 00:50:37,735
I have a contract...

547
00:50:38,194 --> 00:50:39,445
with Angelbay.

548
00:50:40,321 --> 00:50:43,407
And if I told you
I could offer you a better one?

549
00:50:43,783 --> 00:50:49,205
Then, Mr. Collins, I would tell you
to take a long walk off a short pier.

550
00:50:49,914 --> 00:50:54,710
There is such a thing as loyalty
in our line of work.

551
00:50:55,962 --> 00:50:57,463
I see.

552
00:50:58,965 --> 00:51:00,466
Mr. Clarney...

553
00:51:03,803 --> 00:51:06,889
you have grown rather weary
of working for Angelbay.

554
00:51:07,974 --> 00:51:12,395
In fact, you would rather sell
your soul to Satan...

555
00:51:13,145 --> 00:51:15,648
than sell another fish
to Angelique Bouchard.

556
00:51:15,815 --> 00:51:18,150
Do you understand?

557
00:51:19,652 --> 00:51:21,320
I...

558
00:51:21,821 --> 00:51:23,322
understand.

559
00:51:23,489 --> 00:51:25,366
Very good.

560
00:51:26,325 --> 00:51:27,743
Now...

561
00:51:28,369 --> 00:51:30,663
if you would be so kind
as to introduce me...

562
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:33,332
to some of your fellow captains...

563
00:52:34,935 --> 00:52:38,230
Barnabas? Why are you staring
into Carolyn's room?

564
00:52:38,898 --> 00:52:40,900
What is that thing?

565
00:52:41,817 --> 00:52:43,235
It's a lamp.

566
00:52:43,861 --> 00:52:47,114
It looks like a pulsating blood urn.

567
00:52:47,948 --> 00:52:50,743
I think it's time I showed you
my office, Barnabas.

568
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:53,871
Do you know what a psychiatrist is?

569
00:52:54,038 --> 00:52:56,415
Regrettably, the word is foreign to me.

570
00:52:56,582 --> 00:53:00,211
May I assume it is some species
of American delicacy?

571
00:53:01,212 --> 00:53:05,257
It's a medical doctor that specializes
in disorders of the mind.

572
00:53:05,424 --> 00:53:07,103
I'm a psychiatrist.

573
00:53:09,428 --> 00:53:12,431
Now, where were you born?

574
00:53:13,099 --> 00:53:16,060
- Liverpool.
- Can you describe it for me?

575
00:53:16,227 --> 00:53:17,770
Filthy.

576
00:53:17,937 --> 00:53:20,272
The air is choked with soot
and the streets reek...

577
00:53:20,439 --> 00:53:22,566
of freshly hurled chamber pots.

578
00:53:22,733 --> 00:53:25,778
The smell of urine permeates the air.

579
00:53:28,114 --> 00:53:30,449
Have you any experience with hypnotism, Barnabas?

580
00:53:31,283 --> 00:53:33,703
I find it very useful, yes.

581
00:53:34,078 --> 00:53:35,788
Yes, I agree.

582
00:53:37,123 --> 00:53:38,708
You see...

583
00:53:39,291 --> 00:53:44,130
sometimes we make up a fantasy world...

584
00:53:44,296 --> 00:53:46,966
to help us erase horrible memories
from our past.

585
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,053
I find hypnotism cuts through all that.

586
00:53:52,304 --> 00:53:55,474
I employ it for other purposes.

587
00:53:55,891 --> 00:53:57,893
May I hypnotize you, Barnabas?

588
00:53:58,936 --> 00:54:00,604
Madam...

589
00:54:00,771 --> 00:54:04,483
I do not believe that remotely possi....

590
00:54:07,987 --> 00:54:09,447
Good.

591
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:14,160
Now...

592
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:17,246
I'd like you to tell me a few things.

593
00:54:19,623 --> 00:54:20,666
A vampire?

594
00:54:21,667 --> 00:54:24,044
Keep your voice down.

595
00:54:24,336 --> 00:54:26,589
What on earth are you talking about?

596
00:54:26,756 --> 00:54:30,718
Oh, spare me.
I had him under hypnosis for hours.

597
00:54:30,885 --> 00:54:32,044
Barnabas?

598
00:54:32,111 --> 00:54:35,181
You know Elizabeth, there's a point 
where delusions fail, but his didn't budge.

599
00:54:35,347 --> 00:54:36,932
He told me everything...

600
00:54:37,099 --> 00:54:39,810
including that you've known his secret
since the minute he arrived!

601
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:42,772
- Why the hell didn't you say anything?
- I was protecting the children.

602
00:54:42,938 --> 00:54:45,941
Oh, by letting a vampire
use one of the guest bedrooms?

603
00:54:46,108 --> 00:54:48,819
Do you know he admitted killing 
those men at the construction site.

604
00:54:48,986 --> 00:54:51,489
- He's a murderer.
- He's a Collins and a good man...

605
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:54,950
and these days,
that's a desperately rare combination.

606
00:54:55,117 --> 00:54:57,828
Oh, yes, I almost forgot,
the family that can do no wrong.

607
00:54:57,995 --> 00:55:00,164
You know, Julia, I'm surprised at you.

608
00:55:00,706 --> 00:55:05,503
I'd think a physician like you
would find him fascinating.

609
00:55:06,962 --> 00:55:08,297
Well, sure.

610
00:55:08,464 --> 00:55:13,469
Medically, psychologically and physically,
he's fascinating.

611
00:55:13,844 --> 00:55:16,889
Which is exactly why I came to you
instead of the police.

612
00:55:17,056 --> 00:55:19,475
Then be fascinated, Julia.

613
00:55:20,226 --> 00:55:24,396
And if you have an ounce of love
or respect for this family...

614
00:55:24,563 --> 00:55:26,398
keep your mouth shut.

615
00:55:27,608 --> 00:55:30,236
I don't feel comfortable discussing this with you.

616
00:55:30,402 --> 00:55:32,112
Do not fear, my child.

617
00:55:32,279 --> 00:55:36,826
I simply seek advice on the art
of courting a woman of this time.

618
00:55:36,992 --> 00:55:38,035
Land.

619
00:55:38,577 --> 00:55:42,414
And who better to tutor me
than a woman of your age.

620
00:55:42,748 --> 00:55:44,250
What is your age, if I may?

621
00:55:45,042 --> 00:55:48,879
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen and no husband.

622
00:55:49,046 --> 00:55:51,590
You must put those birthing hips
to good use at once...

623
00:55:51,757 --> 00:55:55,094
lest your womb shrivel up and die.

624
00:55:55,553 --> 00:55:56,929
You're weird.

625
00:55:57,346 --> 00:56:01,267
But do you think me too weird
for a woman of this...

626
00:56:01,433 --> 00:56:02,434
land?

627
00:56:02,601 --> 00:56:04,895
You obviously mean Vicky.

628
00:56:07,481 --> 00:56:12,570
She has the most fertile birthing hips
I have ever laid eyes upon.

629
00:56:13,445 --> 00:56:14,947
You're way too weird.

630
00:56:15,573 --> 00:56:16,949
Do you really think so?

631
00:56:17,616 --> 00:56:21,036
You're all stiff, proper and old-fashioned.

632
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:24,331
And Victoria...

633
00:56:25,082 --> 00:56:27,918
is she not proper?

634
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:31,672
She likes to pretend she's rock 'n' roll.

635
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:34,383
She's a Carpenters kind of chick for sure.

636
00:56:35,885 --> 00:56:39,221
Do you mean to say that she has
a penchant for woodworkers?

637
00:56:39,388 --> 00:56:41,557
The Carpenters are musicians, stupid.

638
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:44,810
Music.

639
00:56:44,977 --> 00:56:49,148
Yes, I'm rather fond
of the music of the day.

640
00:56:52,109 --> 00:56:53,986
<i>I am a picker</i>

641
00:56:54,153 --> 00:56:56,780
<i>I am a grinner</i>

642
00:56:56,947 --> 00:56:58,991
<i>I am a lover</i>

643
00:56:59,658 --> 00:57:03,162
<i>And I am a sinner</i>

644
00:57:03,871 --> 00:57:05,331
<i>I play my music</i>

645
00:57:06,665 --> 00:57:08,042
<i>In the sun</i>

646
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:13,339
If only Shakespeare had been as eloquent.

647
00:57:13,505 --> 00:57:15,215
Okay.

648
00:57:15,841 --> 00:57:19,053
If you wanna get with her,
you're gonna have to change your approach.

649
00:57:19,219 --> 00:57:21,555
Drop the whole weird
Swinging London thing...

650
00:57:21,722 --> 00:57:24,099
and hang out with a few normal people.

651
00:57:30,564 --> 00:57:32,816
You know what's good about this war, man?

652
00:57:32,983 --> 00:57:34,234
- What?
- No way, man.

653
00:57:34,443 --> 00:57:36,528
No, no, no, listen up.

654
00:57:36,695 --> 00:57:38,697
What's good about this war...

655
00:57:38,864 --> 00:57:40,991
is that it's so bad...

656
00:57:41,325 --> 00:57:43,452
it's gonna be the last one.

657
00:57:43,619 --> 00:57:45,829
- Yeah.
- The last one.

658
00:57:45,996 --> 00:57:49,124
And this last war we're in the middle of...

659
00:57:49,583 --> 00:57:51,460
who wins?

660
00:57:54,171 --> 00:57:57,800
- Peace wins, man.
- Yeah.

661
00:57:57,967 --> 00:58:01,679
- Peace wins every war.
- Yeah.

662
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:04,431
- Every war.
- Yeah.

663
00:58:06,225 --> 00:58:10,187
- You speak of peace.
- Yeah.

664
00:58:12,231 --> 00:58:16,527
I have spent the last two centuries
locked in a box...

665
00:58:18,112 --> 00:58:20,990
staring into the all-consuming void.

666
00:58:21,156 --> 00:58:24,994
The dark shadows of one's soul.

667
00:58:25,911 --> 00:58:27,413
That's heavy, man.

668
00:58:28,288 --> 00:58:32,835
Man, you tripped for two centuries?

669
00:58:33,127 --> 00:58:34,878
Indeed.

670
00:58:35,045 --> 00:58:37,840
But with great purpose, methinks.

671
00:58:38,424 --> 00:58:43,929
For I believe that I have found
my one true love.

672
00:58:45,431 --> 00:58:47,933
Alas, I know not how to win
her tender affections...

673
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:51,104
for I fear that I am a relic in her eyes.

674
00:58:52,271 --> 00:58:54,940
- That's what they say about us.
- Yeah.

675
00:58:57,109 --> 00:58:58,777
Where I'm from...

676
00:58:58,944 --> 00:59:03,282
the love of a woman is won
by giving money to her father.

677
00:59:04,783 --> 00:59:06,827
Or sheep.

678
00:59:07,536 --> 00:59:10,622
And if the love is earnest enough...

679
00:59:10,789 --> 00:59:14,460
then perhaps even a combination of the two.

680
00:59:15,294 --> 00:59:18,839
Women don't care about money...

681
00:59:19,256 --> 00:59:20,924
or sheep.

682
00:59:21,091 --> 00:59:22,760
Yeah.

683
00:59:23,093 --> 00:59:24,970
Are you absolutely certain?

684
00:59:26,472 --> 00:59:28,223
Love.

685
00:59:28,474 --> 00:59:30,642
Chicks dig love, man.

686
00:59:31,602 --> 00:59:34,104
Yeah.

687
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,689
Yes.

688
00:59:35,981 --> 00:59:37,816
I am reminded of a line...

689
00:59:37,983 --> 00:59:42,488
from Erich Segal's wonderful novel,
<i>Love Story.</i>

690
00:59:44,281 --> 00:59:48,118
"Love means never having to say...

691
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:50,245
you are sorry."

692
00:59:50,996 --> 00:59:54,416
That is so beautiful.

693
00:59:54,583 --> 00:59:59,963
However, please know that it is
with sincere regret...

694
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:05,177
that I must now kill all of you.

695
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:07,313
Yeah.

696
01:00:18,857 --> 01:00:20,025
No, it's brilliant.

697
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,860
Theoretically, anyway.

698
01:00:22,027 --> 01:00:25,364
A series of transfusions
to try and purify your blood.

699
01:00:26,198 --> 01:00:29,076
And my soul with it.

700
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:34,206
I should warn you, Barnabas,
there's a slight chance it won't work.

701
01:00:34,373 --> 01:00:37,334
It isn't exactly the kind of thing
they teach in medical school.

702
01:00:37,501 --> 01:00:39,419
You must have faith, doctor...

703
01:00:39,586 --> 01:00:44,091
for if a man can become a monster,
then a monster can become a man.

704
01:00:44,258 --> 01:00:46,218
But why become a man, Barnabas?

705
01:00:46,385 --> 01:00:49,012
Why give up the gift of eternal youth?

706
01:00:49,179 --> 01:00:52,057
Look at me. Every year I get
half as pretty and twice as drunk.

707
01:00:53,767 --> 01:00:55,727
If that is true, madam...

708
01:00:55,894 --> 01:01:01,024
you must have started as the most
beautiful creature that has ever lived.

709
01:01:06,697 --> 01:01:07,906
Barnabas...

710
01:01:08,073 --> 01:01:12,411
are you aware of the concept
of doctor-patient confidentiality?

711
01:01:13,162 --> 01:01:14,746
No.

712
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:17,416
Perhaps you would be kind enough
to enlighten me.

713
01:01:19,209 --> 01:01:20,919
All right.

714
01:01:34,183 --> 01:01:35,934
Barnabas!

715
01:01:36,885 --> 01:01:38,270
Victoria.

716
01:01:38,437 --> 01:01:40,606
Mind if I tag along?

717
01:01:40,772 --> 01:01:43,066
Nothing would make me happier.

718
01:01:43,525 --> 01:01:45,444
You've come down for a stroll?

719
01:01:45,611 --> 01:01:47,905
Actually, I came down looking for David.

720
01:01:48,071 --> 01:01:49,990
God knows where he's run off to now.

721
01:01:50,157 --> 01:01:53,160
We'll be lucky if we see him
before Christmas.

722
01:01:53,327 --> 01:01:54,953
He's a fine lad.

723
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:58,540
Every bit as curious and rambunctious
as I was.

724
01:01:59,124 --> 01:02:01,293
He idolizes you.

725
01:02:01,501 --> 01:02:05,631
Between you and his mother,
I can hardly get him to talk about anything else.

726
01:02:06,423 --> 01:02:11,303
You believe him,
that he sees her and speaks to her?

727
01:02:13,305 --> 01:02:16,892
Part of me believes he's a lonely boy
looking for comfort.

728
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:21,939
Part of me believes there are things
in this world we don't understand.

729
01:02:22,105 --> 01:02:26,860
Things like magic, death, destiny.

730
01:02:27,736 --> 01:02:31,990
I guess as long as it makes him happy,
what does it matter what anyone believes?

731
01:02:34,826 --> 01:02:36,828
Eloquently put.

732
01:02:39,122 --> 01:02:41,500
Maybe we're getting too worked up
about this, Angie.

733
01:02:41,667 --> 01:02:44,670
They spruced up the cannery
and renovated their house. So what?

734
01:02:44,836 --> 01:02:49,383
We still hold pink slips on 95 percent
of the nets dragging the Grand Banks.

735
01:02:49,549 --> 01:02:50,759
He's right.

736
01:02:50,926 --> 01:02:53,637
It doesn't mean anything to our bottom line.

737
01:02:54,012 --> 01:02:55,514
"Doesn't mean anything"?

738
01:02:58,684 --> 01:03:01,436
"Doesn't mean anything"?

739
01:03:03,522 --> 01:03:06,358
My great-great grandmother started Angelbay...

740
01:03:06,525 --> 01:03:12,239
to show those Collins
that they didn't own the water.

741
01:03:12,656 --> 01:03:16,451
That they couldn't look down
their entitled noses at us.

742
01:03:16,618 --> 01:03:20,163
The Bouchard women slaved
for over two centuries...

743
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:24,042
sacrificing their lives to build this business.

744
01:03:25,502 --> 01:03:27,879
So that means something, gentlemen.

745
01:03:28,547 --> 01:03:32,384
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna see it
destroyed by those bastards.

746
01:03:34,553 --> 01:03:37,055
Call and arrange a meeting.

747
01:03:45,105 --> 01:03:48,233
Sell to you? Never.

748
01:03:49,067 --> 01:03:53,405
One cannot put a price
on the restoration of a family's honor.

749
01:03:54,364 --> 01:03:55,699
Let me try.

750
01:04:01,747 --> 01:04:06,418
I had no idea that my business acumen
was giving you such spasms.

751
01:04:06,585 --> 01:04:10,756
Hypnotizing fishermen
isn't business acumen, Barnabas.

752
01:04:11,631 --> 01:04:13,008
Those are my terms.

753
01:04:13,383 --> 01:04:14,718
Here are my terms:

754
01:04:15,135 --> 01:04:17,346
Goest thou to hell, and swiftly, please.

755
01:04:17,512 --> 01:04:22,434
And there may Asmodeus himself
suckle from your diseased teat.

756
01:04:23,601 --> 01:04:25,937
No one talks like you anymore, Barnabas.

757
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,607
Yes, indeed.

758
01:04:29,358 --> 01:04:32,819
I must say this age does remain a mystery to me.

759
01:04:33,362 --> 01:04:36,948
Give me one good reason
why I should not kill you this instant.

760
01:04:37,741 --> 01:04:39,701
Because I'd kill you if you tried.

761
01:04:40,285 --> 01:04:42,287
Impossible.

762
01:04:42,454 --> 01:04:44,915
That would require mercy.

763
01:04:45,082 --> 01:04:47,376
Instead, you have made me a monster.

764
01:04:47,542 --> 01:04:49,294
We're both monsters, Barnabas.

765
01:04:50,962 --> 01:04:54,841
Just two big fish in an itty-bitty pond.

766
01:04:55,175 --> 01:04:59,388
Now, we can either fight
until one of us is dead...

767
01:04:59,554 --> 01:05:03,850
or we can make...

768
01:05:06,937 --> 01:05:08,438
little fish together.

769
01:05:11,316 --> 01:05:15,529
I'll be honest. I was really angry at you
for the first century or so.

770
01:05:16,696 --> 01:05:19,991
Sure, it was fun...

771
01:05:20,409 --> 01:05:24,121
watching your family squirm
and burn away...

772
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:27,332
like ants under a magnifying glass.

773
01:05:27,499 --> 01:05:32,003
And yes, it was fun being adored
as the Collins name crumbled...

774
01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:35,215
growing wealthy on the backs of their despair.

775
01:05:35,382 --> 01:05:37,384
But lately....

776
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:41,012
Lately it's just been...

777
01:05:41,430 --> 01:05:43,014
lonely.

778
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:47,519
We're different from these people, Barnabas.

779
01:05:47,686 --> 01:05:49,855
We're better than they are.

780
01:05:50,313 --> 01:05:54,317
That's why I've missed you.

781
01:05:54,734 --> 01:05:58,697
You're the only ant I couldn't...

782
01:05:59,030 --> 01:06:00,949
burn.

783
01:06:01,867 --> 01:06:03,869
What is it you want, Angelique?

784
01:06:04,035 --> 01:06:05,036
Your love.

785
01:06:06,371 --> 01:06:08,206
You do still love me, don't you?

786
01:06:08,373 --> 01:06:11,376
Somewhere deep down in that cold,
un-beating heart.

787
01:06:11,751 --> 01:06:17,048
My dear, even Aphrodite herself
could not construct a more odious union.

788
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:18,383
What if I made you?

789
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:20,010
With what, a spell?

790
01:06:20,177 --> 01:06:22,637
A little doll filled with pins?
That is not love.

791
01:06:23,555 --> 01:06:25,008
With this.

792
01:06:26,641 --> 01:06:29,312
The body you once begged me for.

793
01:06:30,479 --> 01:06:33,690
I must admit, they have not aged a day.

794
01:06:33,857 --> 01:06:35,942
I'm willing to start over, Barnabas.

795
01:06:36,109 --> 01:06:40,238
I'm willing to call a truce
if you'll just take me.

796
01:06:42,741 --> 01:06:44,743
I am not as I once was.

797
01:06:45,243 --> 01:06:46,745
I could change that.

798
01:06:47,287 --> 01:06:48,997
And if I refuse?

799
01:06:49,623 --> 01:06:51,875
I'll take everything you love...

800
01:06:52,042 --> 01:06:56,087
starting with that little creature
you've been eyeing so fondly.

801
01:06:56,254 --> 01:06:59,841
The one who looks like Josette.

802
01:07:01,384 --> 01:07:02,886
Well, then...

803
01:07:03,553 --> 01:07:08,517
I suppose strictly in the name of her honor...

804
01:07:09,601 --> 01:07:11,728
I must now defile...

805
01:07:11,895 --> 01:07:15,190
your most intimate and womanly segments.

806
01:08:14,624 --> 01:08:18,587
That was a regrettable turn of events.

807
01:08:19,671 --> 01:08:22,090
You didn't seem to regret it.

808
01:08:22,257 --> 01:08:23,300
Yes.

809
01:08:24,801 --> 01:08:30,015
Seems that even in death,
I have a weakness for the living flesh.

810
01:08:30,682 --> 01:08:32,350
Especially yours.

811
01:08:33,184 --> 01:08:37,606
What a cold way to describe something so hot.

812
01:08:38,523 --> 01:08:40,066
Perhaps.

813
01:08:44,904 --> 01:08:47,699
But I cannot succumb to your charms ever again.

814
01:08:49,659 --> 01:08:52,704
Please, forgive me.

815
01:08:55,874 --> 01:08:58,710
If I can't have you, my love...

816
01:08:58,877 --> 01:09:00,754
I'll destroy you.

817
01:09:16,645 --> 01:09:18,229
Five more minutes.

818
01:09:19,022 --> 01:09:20,899
This is a very silly play.

819
01:09:21,066 --> 01:09:22,859
<i>A werewolf.</i>

820
01:09:23,026 --> 01:09:24,486
<i>A werewolf?</i>

821
01:09:24,861 --> 01:09:27,238
Yeah, well, it's the only station
we get out here.

822
01:09:28,365 --> 01:09:29,491
How are we doing?

823
01:09:29,908 --> 01:09:33,953
I do not feel as though
I'm becoming more human as yet.

824
01:09:39,459 --> 01:09:41,211
Give it some time.

825
01:09:41,586 --> 01:09:47,092
Time, doctor, I have an unfortunate excess of.

826
01:09:51,930 --> 01:09:55,392
<i>This is my favorite doll, called Lucy.</i>

827
01:09:55,558 --> 01:10:00,313
And my favorite bit about Lucy
is her crazy, crazy red hair.

828
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,607
I mean, look at her red hair.

829
01:10:02,774 --> 01:10:05,694
And my second favorite bit about her...

830
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:09,447
is her nice, shiny, pink bow and....

831
01:10:09,614 --> 01:10:11,950
No! Please! Please, no! Please!

832
01:10:12,117 --> 01:10:14,452
Please, I'm begging you! Please, don't!

833
01:10:14,619 --> 01:10:18,331
It's really true! Mommy, Daddy, please!

834
01:10:18,915 --> 01:10:20,959
Mommy! Daddy!

835
01:10:21,126 --> 01:10:22,293
Mommy!

836
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:24,713
Please, Daddy! Daddy!

837
01:10:28,299 --> 01:10:30,009
Help me.

838
01:10:53,283 --> 01:10:54,659
Help me.

839
01:10:55,285 --> 01:10:56,661
Help you what?

840
01:11:05,170 --> 01:11:06,421
A what?

841
01:11:06,588 --> 01:11:07,714
A ball.

842
01:11:07,881 --> 01:11:09,674
And a most splendid one.

843
01:11:09,841 --> 01:11:11,676
A ball for who?

844
01:11:11,843 --> 01:11:13,845
For the entire town, of course.

845
01:11:14,012 --> 01:11:16,264
Don't you know the entire town
kind of hates us?

846
01:11:16,431 --> 01:11:19,184
Balls are demonstrations of power.

847
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:24,606
Balls are how the ruling class
remain the ruling class.

848
01:11:24,773 --> 01:11:27,692
Exactly what I've been saying.
This family could use some balls.

849
01:11:28,026 --> 01:11:32,530
Indeed. And the Collins family
have always held the biggest...

850
01:11:32,697 --> 01:11:34,324
and the most wonderful balls.

851
01:11:34,824 --> 01:11:37,202
Jesus, can somebody shut the drapes?

852
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:39,204
You know, Barnabas has a point.

853
01:11:39,370 --> 01:11:41,607
It's about time we threw
a little dough around.

854
01:11:42,457 --> 01:11:44,709
Show the peasants that we're back in action.

855
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:48,630
People don't throw balls anymore, stupid.

856
01:11:48,797 --> 01:11:50,465
Do they not?

857
01:11:50,632 --> 01:11:52,801
They throw happenings.

858
01:11:54,093 --> 01:11:57,847
And how, pray, does one throw a happening?

859
01:11:58,014 --> 01:11:59,224
Well...

860
01:12:00,058 --> 01:12:02,894
first things first,
you'll need a mirror ball.

861
01:12:03,228 --> 01:12:05,188
Whatever that is, we shall have it.

862
01:12:05,730 --> 01:12:07,398
And booze, lots of booze.

863
01:12:07,565 --> 01:12:08,608
Carolyn.

864
01:12:09,234 --> 01:12:12,570
We shall have spirits enough
to fill a schooner's hull.

865
01:12:13,112 --> 01:12:14,155
And...

866
01:12:15,323 --> 01:12:16,908
Alice Cooper.

867
01:12:18,326 --> 01:12:22,497
I seem to recall an Alice Cooper
from my youth.

868
01:12:23,456 --> 01:12:25,333
Does she reside in Collinsport?

869
01:12:25,583 --> 01:12:26,876
Not exactly.

870
01:12:27,585 --> 01:12:30,213
Well, she shall be our guest nonetheless.

871
01:12:40,932 --> 01:12:42,350
How do you do?

872
01:12:42,934 --> 01:12:44,602
- Thank you for having us.
- Evening.

873
01:12:44,769 --> 01:12:46,521
Good evening. Welcome to Collinwood.

874
01:12:46,688 --> 01:12:50,316
I have to hand it to you.
This is a happening.

875
01:12:50,483 --> 01:12:53,069
I guess the only thing missing
is Alice Cooper.

876
01:12:53,236 --> 01:12:57,782
Perhaps you should go and acquaint yourself
with the evening's entertainment.

877
01:13:08,835 --> 01:13:14,883
<i>I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing
Till they got ahold of me</i>

878
01:13:16,467 --> 01:13:20,096
<i>I opened doors for little old ladies</i>

879
01:13:20,263 --> 01:13:23,057
<i>I helped the blind to see</i>

880
01:13:24,058 --> 01:13:28,146
<i>I got no friends 'cause they read the papers</i>

881
01:13:28,313 --> 01:13:32,066
<i>They can't be seen with me</i>

882
01:13:32,233 --> 01:13:37,113
<i>And I'm getting real shot down
And I'm feeling mean</i>

883
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:39,449
Ugliest woman I've ever seen.

884
01:13:39,616 --> 01:13:42,327
<i>No more Mr. Nice Guy</i>

885
01:13:42,493 --> 01:13:46,164
<i>No more Mr. Clean</i>

886
01:13:46,331 --> 01:13:48,791
<i>No more Mr. Nice Guy</i>

887
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:54,172
<i>They say he's sick
He's obscene</i>

888
01:13:57,759 --> 01:14:00,970
<i>I got no friends 'cause they read the papers</i>

889
01:14:01,512 --> 01:14:02,680
Master David.

890
01:14:03,181 --> 01:14:05,350
Where is the female coat attendant?

891
01:14:05,725 --> 01:14:07,852
My dad's talking to her inside.

892
01:14:10,688 --> 01:14:12,857
But he told me to keep everybody out.

893
01:14:13,024 --> 01:14:16,027
I'm sure he did, David.
And you've done a marvelous job.

894
01:14:16,444 --> 01:14:20,698
But now I would like you to go
and watch Alice Cooper with the others.

895
01:14:21,866 --> 01:14:22,909
But my dad said--

896
01:14:23,076 --> 01:14:27,705
Go and watch the Cooper woman.

897
01:14:41,386 --> 01:14:43,554
You were right about this stuff.

898
01:14:44,055 --> 01:14:46,224
Nothing but the best for you, pussycat.

899
01:14:47,433 --> 01:14:48,476
Who was the kid?

900
01:14:49,310 --> 01:14:52,230
I have no idea.
I never saw him before.

901
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:55,984
Now...

902
01:14:56,985 --> 01:14:58,403
come here.

903
01:15:11,624 --> 01:15:14,252
Mommy, where's Daddy?

904
01:15:14,961 --> 01:15:17,255
He's been gone for so long.

905
01:15:17,588 --> 01:15:20,049
Is he ever coming home?

906
01:15:35,857 --> 01:15:39,360
<i>I was gone for 14 days</i>

907
01:15:41,112 --> 01:15:43,990
<i>I could've been gone for more</i>

908
01:15:44,157 --> 01:15:46,617
Whatever are you doing outside, my dear?

909
01:15:46,784 --> 01:15:48,870
You'll catch your death of cold.

910
01:15:49,037 --> 01:15:51,581
I've caught the only thing that matters, Barnabas.

911
01:15:52,290 --> 01:15:53,958
Your eye.

912
01:15:56,544 --> 01:15:59,213
I have withheld my tender affections...

913
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:01,924
fearful that they were unrequited.

914
01:16:03,134 --> 01:16:06,471
I've not spoken of my feelings
to another soul.

915
01:16:06,637 --> 01:16:10,892
Right. You've only spoken
of my birthing hips.

916
01:16:11,768 --> 01:16:14,270
Yes, well....

917
01:16:16,814 --> 01:16:21,277
I don't know why, but for some reason,
I feel like I can tell you anything.

918
01:16:22,487 --> 01:16:24,906
It's like I've known you forever.

919
01:16:25,490 --> 01:16:27,158
Yes.

920
01:16:27,325 --> 01:16:31,412
It's almost hypnotic.

921
01:16:32,038 --> 01:16:33,498
Yes.

922
01:16:33,664 --> 01:16:34,749
But, wait, no.

923
01:16:34,916 --> 01:16:38,961
I have used no such trickery
to summon your ardor, I assure you.

924
01:16:39,545 --> 01:16:43,508
I don't know what it is. I just know
there's always been something pulling me here.

925
01:16:43,674 --> 01:16:45,843
Pulling me to Collinsport.

926
01:16:46,135 --> 01:16:47,845
To you.

927
01:16:51,682 --> 01:16:53,184
Oh, my dear Victoria.

928
01:16:53,684 --> 01:16:56,854
- Hath my scent offended thee?
- No, no.

929
01:16:57,021 --> 01:16:58,523
I'm sorry. It's just....

930
01:17:00,942 --> 01:17:03,986
The people I love haven't always loved me back.

931
01:17:06,864 --> 01:17:10,618
<i>My own family sent me away.
Swept me under the rug...</i>

932
01:17:10,785 --> 01:17:14,455
<i>because it was easier than having
a daughter who was different.</i>

933
01:17:15,206 --> 01:17:17,542
<i>Who was cursed.</i>

934
01:17:18,334 --> 01:17:21,379
Cursed because I saw things
other little girls didn't.

935
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:27,718
<i>They were the loneliest,
most painful years a child could know.</i>

936
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:31,514
Now, hold still, Maggie.

937
01:17:32,056 --> 01:17:33,724
This will only hurt for a minute.

938
01:17:39,355 --> 01:17:41,983
<i>But as hard as they were,
I never lost my will.</i>

939
01:17:42,567 --> 01:17:45,027
<i>The need to feel the sun
on my face again.</i>

940
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:54,745
<i>So I set out in search of a new home.</i>

941
01:17:54,912 --> 01:17:57,582
<i>A new life, far away from that pain.</i>

942
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:06,591
But even in my wildest dreams,
I never thought I'd feel as happy as I do now.

943
01:18:07,258 --> 01:18:11,596
To betray one's own kin,
and because she possesses a gift.

944
01:18:11,762 --> 01:18:13,097
No, Victoria.

945
01:18:13,389 --> 01:18:14,765
It is unforgivable.

946
01:18:14,932 --> 01:18:21,105
And your parents deserve to boil
in hell's everlasting sulfur.

947
01:18:21,272 --> 01:18:26,277
<i>See my lonely life unfold</i>

948
01:18:26,736 --> 01:18:30,406
<i>Since I've gone away</i>

949
01:18:33,783 --> 01:18:34,702
Hey.

950
01:18:35,119 --> 01:18:36,587
Hey, you're not invited.

951
01:18:38,915 --> 01:18:40,008
Hey.

952
01:18:41,375 --> 01:18:42,418
But--

953
01:18:42,585 --> 01:18:45,463
<i>Sleeping dont come very easy</i>

954
01:18:46,088 --> 01:18:48,799
<i>In a straight, white vest</i>

955
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:56,265
<i>Should like to see that little children</i>

956
01:18:56,432 --> 01:18:58,601
<i>She's only 4 years old</i>

957
01:18:59,227 --> 01:19:01,979
For most of my life,
I've wanted a place where I belonged.

958
01:19:02,146 --> 01:19:04,232
A place where I could feel at home again.

959
01:19:04,815 --> 01:19:06,567
Feel loved again.

960
01:19:07,318 --> 01:19:10,279
And I've found that place here at Collinwood.

961
01:19:12,990 --> 01:19:14,659
And here.

962
01:19:37,056 --> 01:19:39,517
We must intensify our efforts.

963
01:19:39,684 --> 01:19:41,936
I have urgent need to be human again.

964
01:19:42,103 --> 01:19:43,187
I can explain.

965
01:19:44,188 --> 01:19:45,356
My God.

966
01:19:45,523 --> 01:19:48,109
You're not using your blood
to make me human.

967
01:19:48,734 --> 01:19:52,196
You're using my blood
to make yourself immortal.

968
01:19:52,363 --> 01:19:56,701
Yes, but, Barnabas, you have a gift.
It isn't fail to keep it all to yourself.

969
01:19:56,867 --> 01:20:00,079
The Collins family took you in,
bestowed their sacred trust upon you.

970
01:20:00,246 --> 01:20:01,956
And you brazenly betray that trust.

971
01:20:02,123 --> 01:20:03,541
I'm sorry.

972
01:20:03,708 --> 01:20:05,126
I just don't want to grow old.

973
01:20:05,584 --> 01:20:07,545
I want to be beautiful again.

974
01:20:07,712 --> 01:20:11,465
- I want to live forever, like you.
- I'm afraid that is out of the question.

975
01:20:13,009 --> 01:20:16,554
A stout man contains some five quarts of blood...

976
01:20:16,721 --> 01:20:18,848
which, if you will forgive the boast...

977
01:20:19,015 --> 01:20:22,059
I can consume in a mere
seven and a half seconds.

978
01:20:22,768 --> 01:20:24,895
But you, my dear little wisp...

979
01:20:25,229 --> 01:20:28,899
I dare say I shall drink you
to a withered husk in less than five.

980
01:20:29,066 --> 01:20:32,069
Please don't kill me. You're a good man.
You're a gentleman.

981
01:20:32,236 --> 01:20:34,405
- Please, forgive me.
- Madam.

982
01:20:34,572 --> 01:20:39,535
I am neither good nor gentle,
and I do not forgive.

983
01:20:56,469 --> 01:20:58,721
I should tell you, Willie...

984
01:20:58,888 --> 01:21:01,307
if you ever speak a word of this to anyone...

985
01:21:01,474 --> 01:21:04,977
I shall have to kill you
in a most unpleasant manner.

986
01:21:05,144 --> 01:21:06,437
Don't worry, Mr. B.

987
01:21:06,604 --> 01:21:09,106
I never liked the bitch anyway.

988
01:21:50,398 --> 01:21:53,692
Come on. I know you're here.

989
01:21:56,237 --> 01:21:57,488
Hey.

990
01:21:57,655 --> 01:21:59,490
Beautiful workmanship, isn't it?

991
01:22:00,799 --> 01:22:03,244
I was just looking for the, uh....

992
01:22:03,619 --> 01:22:04,954
This?

993
01:22:06,705 --> 01:22:09,250
There's nothing worth stealing,
I'm afraid.

994
01:22:09,667 --> 01:22:13,838
Sadly, Elizabeth uses it
for the badminton equipment.

995
01:22:15,506 --> 01:22:16,924
That's what I was looking for.

996
01:22:21,595 --> 01:22:22,638
What are you?

997
01:22:23,347 --> 01:22:25,516
I am about to do something so repellent...

998
01:22:25,683 --> 01:22:29,019
that it sickens me to my very core.

999
01:22:33,566 --> 01:22:35,609
I'm going to give you a choice.

1000
01:22:36,861 --> 01:22:38,362
What choice?

1001
01:22:38,529 --> 01:22:41,115
Either you remain at Collinwood...

1002
01:22:41,282 --> 01:22:45,369
and devote your every waking moment
to becoming an exemplary father...

1003
01:22:46,203 --> 01:22:51,500
the father David so desperately
wants and deserves...

1004
01:22:52,084 --> 01:22:53,210
Or?

1005
01:22:53,461 --> 01:22:55,337
Or you leave...

1006
01:22:55,504 --> 01:22:56,839
with sufficient money...

1007
01:22:57,006 --> 01:23:01,760
to live your thieving, selfish life elsewhere.

1008
01:23:37,755 --> 01:23:41,509
Where on earth is Dr. Hoffman
when we need her?

1009
01:23:42,343 --> 01:23:44,094
Indeed.

1010
01:24:23,467 --> 01:24:26,720
Barnabas, you're on fire.

1011
01:25:00,504 --> 01:25:04,592
<i>I'd like to teach the world to sing</i>

1012
01:25:07,469 --> 01:25:09,930
I demand that you release me from my curse.

1013
01:25:10,097 --> 01:25:12,099
You're late.

1014
01:25:15,811 --> 01:25:16,854
What is that?

1015
01:25:17,021 --> 01:25:19,023
The only thing you drink these days.

1016
01:25:23,027 --> 01:25:24,903
From where does it come?

1017
01:25:25,070 --> 01:25:26,196
No one you know.

1018
01:25:26,363 --> 01:25:28,365
I promise.

1019
01:25:34,038 --> 01:25:36,457
I knew it wouldn't be long
before you barged in...

1020
01:25:36,624 --> 01:25:39,376
begging me to make you mortal again.

1021
01:25:39,543 --> 01:25:43,297
Now that Dr. Hoffman isn't around
to give you your little transfusions.

1022
01:25:44,298 --> 01:25:45,799
Yes.

1023
01:25:45,966 --> 01:25:48,802
Yes, it was a shame...

1024
01:25:48,969 --> 01:25:52,640
she was called away on business so suddenly.

1025
01:25:53,891 --> 01:25:57,436
Interesting. I don't know many people
who take business meetings...

1026
01:25:57,603 --> 01:25:59,480
on the bottom of the ocean.

1027
01:26:01,482 --> 01:26:02,733
She was a liar.

1028
01:26:03,442 --> 01:26:05,402
She was stealing my blood.

1029
01:26:05,569 --> 01:26:07,696
Aren't we being a smidge hypocritical?

1030
01:26:08,155 --> 01:26:11,909
Lying and stealing blood
are things you're rather familiar with.

1031
01:26:12,242 --> 01:26:16,080
Yes, I killed Dr. Hoffman...

1032
01:26:16,246 --> 01:26:20,000
and the workmen and those very nice,
unshaven young people.

1033
01:26:20,959 --> 01:26:22,586
But know this:

1034
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:26,423
With each life I take...

1035
01:26:26,590 --> 01:26:28,884
a piece of my wretched soul dies.

1036
01:26:29,968 --> 01:26:33,722
For I only kill because I'm compelled to.

1037
01:26:33,889 --> 01:26:35,599
Compelled by your witchcraft.

1038
01:26:35,766 --> 01:26:37,434
By your curse.

1039
01:26:39,103 --> 01:26:40,938
Why have you done this to me?

1040
01:26:42,773 --> 01:26:44,441
It's a shame.

1041
01:26:44,858 --> 01:26:49,738
You know, if you'd just been smart enough
to love me, I would've let her go.

1042
01:26:50,614 --> 01:26:52,574
Speak plainly, snake.

1043
01:26:53,409 --> 01:26:56,370
I sent your little girlfriend
over the cliffs once before.

1044
01:26:56,537 --> 01:26:59,331
What makes you think
I wouldn't do it again?

1045
01:27:04,503 --> 01:27:07,423
I'm gonna offer you
a business proposal, Barnabas.

1046
01:27:08,632 --> 01:27:10,801
My final offer.

1047
01:27:11,301 --> 01:27:14,930
Either you agree to rule
this little pond of mine side by side...

1048
01:27:15,097 --> 01:27:17,599
partners and lovers...

1049
01:27:18,308 --> 01:27:22,438
or I put you back in the box.

1050
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:27,109
I have already prepared my counterproposal.

1051
01:27:27,526 --> 01:27:29,278
It reads thusly:

1052
01:27:29,445 --> 01:27:32,573
You may strategically place
your wonderful lips upon my posterior...

1053
01:27:32,740 --> 01:27:34,283
and kiss it repeatedly!

1054
01:28:16,033 --> 01:28:19,203
<i>Sleeping flame, I summon thee</i>

1055
01:28:19,369 --> 01:28:21,622
<i>To your form return</i>

1056
01:28:21,789 --> 01:28:24,208
<i>Make the night as bright as day</i>

1057
01:28:24,374 --> 01:28:27,711
<i>And burn, baby, burn</i>

1058
01:28:53,779 --> 01:28:55,155
Wha--?

1059
01:29:29,439 --> 01:29:32,442
I've come to realize shutting you
in that box for all eternity...

1060
01:29:32,609 --> 01:29:34,444
might've been a tad harsh.

1061
01:29:34,778 --> 01:29:36,738
So here is the deal:

1062
01:29:38,365 --> 01:29:41,493
I'm gonna destroy everything you love...

1063
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:47,416
and you're gonna take some more time
to think about us.

1064
01:29:51,211 --> 01:29:53,463
See you in a couple centuries, lover boy.

1065
01:30:06,894 --> 01:30:11,481
Do not dismay, Barnabas.
We shall yet again escape this nightmare.

1066
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:16,069
Perhaps only a few brief decades this time.

1067
01:30:19,489 --> 01:30:21,325
Oh, hello!

1068
01:30:21,491 --> 01:30:23,535
Hello! I hear you!

1069
01:30:23,702 --> 01:30:29,124
Oh, sweet glories be. Whoever you are,
fear not. I will not harm you.

1070
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:32,794
What year is it?
How many centuries have I--?

1071
01:30:32,961 --> 01:30:34,713
How long has it been?

1072
01:30:36,423 --> 01:30:38,008
It's been 20 minutes.

1073
01:30:38,175 --> 01:30:41,511
Young Master David. How on earth
did you know I was imprisoned?

1074
01:30:42,346 --> 01:30:44,181
My mom told me.

1075
01:30:44,348 --> 01:30:46,266
You probably think I'm crazy.

1076
01:30:46,767 --> 01:30:49,686
Young man, I think nothing of the sort.

1077
01:30:51,021 --> 01:30:52,522
Uncle Barnabas...

1078
01:30:53,899 --> 01:30:56,193
why do you have ladies' underwear
on your face?

1079
01:30:56,526 --> 01:30:59,279
Never mind that. Where is your family?
Where is Victoria?

1080
01:30:59,446 --> 01:31:00,656
I haven't seen Vicky...

1081
01:31:00,822 --> 01:31:03,742
but everybody else is in the town
watching our cannery burn.

1082
01:31:03,909 --> 01:31:05,285
We must save them! Hurry!

1083
01:31:06,536 --> 01:31:08,246
Master David!

1084
01:31:08,789 --> 01:31:12,125
Perhaps you should unchain me first?

1085
01:31:12,292 --> 01:31:15,671
Hank, we need another brigade
out of Portland, quick as you can!

1086
01:31:15,837 --> 01:31:17,547
Get these folks out of here!

1087
01:31:17,714 --> 01:31:22,260
All right, everybody, stand back!
Please, stand back!

1088
01:31:22,427 --> 01:31:25,889
Oh, boy.
Miss Elizabeth's gonna shit a brick.

1089
01:31:26,974 --> 01:31:28,558
Sheriff, we need to talk.

1090
01:31:28,725 --> 01:31:32,312
Christ, Angie, I ain't got time for chitchat.
The damned town's burning!

1091
01:31:32,771 --> 01:31:37,150
You don't have time for proof
that the Collins family is harboring a murderer?

1092
01:31:39,569 --> 01:31:42,656
<i>Yes, I killed Dr. Hoffman...</i>

1093
01:31:42,823 --> 01:31:46,493
<i>and the workmen and those very nice,
unshaven young people.</i>

1094
01:31:48,829 --> 01:31:50,622
Well, I'll be damned.

1095
01:31:50,789 --> 01:31:53,083
And to think the whole town's
named after them.

1096
01:31:53,250 --> 01:31:56,086
I'd be willing to bet that Barnabas
has already skipped town.

1097
01:31:56,628 --> 01:31:57,963
And I'd be willing to bet...

1098
01:31:58,130 --> 01:32:01,758
that you'll find the corpses
of more of his innocent victims in there!

1099
01:32:01,925 --> 01:32:05,178
The Collins family has rebuilt
their business with murder!

1100
01:32:06,263 --> 01:32:09,224
Well, I say, not in my town!

1101
01:32:12,644 --> 01:32:13,937
There's one of them now!

1102
01:32:14,104 --> 01:32:17,607
He's probably the one who started the fire
to cover his boss' tracks.

1103
01:32:18,984 --> 01:32:20,736
- Time to go.
- Where you going?

1104
01:32:45,469 --> 01:32:48,055
Willie. What on earth's happened?

1105
01:32:48,221 --> 01:32:51,850
Fire. Murder. Angry mob. Run!

1106
01:32:52,893 --> 01:32:54,603
David, go inside.

1107
01:33:15,082 --> 01:33:16,124
Liz...

1108
01:33:17,334 --> 01:33:19,044
I'm sorry.

1109
01:33:19,211 --> 01:33:21,338
We're gonna have to take you in.

1110
01:33:21,505 --> 01:33:22,756
All of you.

1111
01:33:23,799 --> 01:33:24,841
Bill...

1112
01:33:25,717 --> 01:33:28,470
the Collins family built this town.

1113
01:33:28,929 --> 01:33:32,349
We built it with our boats and our nets.

1114
01:33:32,808 --> 01:33:35,018
With our sacrifices and our blood.

1115
01:33:35,185 --> 01:33:36,978
And this is how you repay us?

1116
01:33:37,145 --> 01:33:39,147
You've been harboring a murderer.

1117
01:33:39,981 --> 01:33:41,483
Arrest them.

1118
01:33:42,025 --> 01:33:43,193
I shall go willingly...

1119
01:33:44,778 --> 01:33:47,489
to whatever punishment awaits...

1120
01:33:48,156 --> 01:33:49,199
provided...

1121
01:33:50,367 --> 01:33:52,702
no harm befalls my family.

1122
01:33:52,869 --> 01:33:54,454
Hold it right there.

1123
01:34:02,295 --> 01:34:03,547
And provided...

1124
01:34:04,381 --> 01:34:06,508
Miss Bouchard goes along with me...

1125
01:34:07,050 --> 01:34:09,136
for she is no less a monster than I.

1126
01:34:14,015 --> 01:34:16,059
Perhaps it is best...

1127
01:34:16,893 --> 01:34:18,228
if we are both destroyed.

1128
01:34:21,898 --> 01:34:25,360
Mr. Collins, back off! I'm warning you!

1129
01:34:29,990 --> 01:34:33,410
Go on, slaughter me.

1130
01:34:33,577 --> 01:34:35,495
Show them what you are.

1131
01:34:35,745 --> 01:34:37,080
No.

1132
01:34:37,706 --> 01:34:39,374
I shall show them what we are.

1133
01:34:55,599 --> 01:34:57,350
What's that man done to Angie?

1134
01:34:58,101 --> 01:35:01,354
It's not him, it's her.

1135
01:35:01,521 --> 01:35:03,190
She's a witch.

1136
01:35:07,611 --> 01:35:09,613
Excuse me.

1137
01:35:16,953 --> 01:35:18,705
You gotta get through me first, lady.

1138
01:35:25,629 --> 01:35:28,131
<i>All right, everybody, go on home now.</i>

1139
01:35:28,298 --> 01:35:30,133
- <i>Nothing to see here.</i>
- Let's move.

1140
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:31,885
You should've loved me, Barnabas.

1141
01:35:32,969 --> 01:35:35,597
None of this would've happened
if you'd just loved me.

1142
01:35:35,764 --> 01:35:39,434
I should have destroyed you.
You've brought me nothing but misery.

1143
01:35:39,809 --> 01:35:41,436
I gave you my heart!

1144
01:35:41,603 --> 01:35:42,812
You have no heart.

1145
01:35:43,396 --> 01:35:44,814
You're the curse!

1146
01:35:45,065 --> 01:35:47,317
Women are undone by loving you.

1147
01:35:47,484 --> 01:35:51,613
Josette, Dr. Hoffman.
And your beloved Vicky.

1148
01:35:52,864 --> 01:35:55,992
I command you to release her
from your curse.

1149
01:35:56,159 --> 01:35:59,704
"Command"? You make me sick.

1150
01:36:01,539 --> 01:36:02,582
Missed me.

1151
01:36:08,171 --> 01:36:11,841
Vulgar, hideous serpent,
I shall deliver you to hell's doorstep.

1152
01:36:25,855 --> 01:36:29,150
Get out of my room!

1153
01:36:54,175 --> 01:36:56,052
Angelique!

1154
01:36:56,219 --> 01:36:58,596
Get out of my house.

1155
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:29,544
Your house?

1156
01:38:00,950 --> 01:38:02,702
Enough trickery.

1157
01:38:05,455 --> 01:38:06,790
I worshipped you.

1158
01:38:06,956 --> 01:38:07,999
Plagued me.

1159
01:38:09,918 --> 01:38:10,960
Adored you!

1160
01:38:12,045 --> 01:38:14,339
Despised you!

1161
01:38:19,052 --> 01:38:20,095
Fine.

1162
01:38:22,347 --> 01:38:25,058
If Collins blood built this house...

1163
01:38:25,975 --> 01:38:28,520
then let us bathe in it.

1164
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:44,053
Leave us alone.

1165
01:39:45,388 --> 01:39:47,056
Carolyn?

1166
01:39:50,393 --> 01:39:52,353
Carolyn, my God.

1167
01:39:54,147 --> 01:39:57,317
I'm a werewolf, okay?
Let's not make a big deal out of it.

1168
01:39:59,736 --> 01:40:00,820
Woof.

1169
01:40:32,936 --> 01:40:35,271
What have you done to my daughter?

1170
01:40:36,105 --> 01:40:37,857
Well, Liz...

1171
01:40:38,441 --> 01:40:42,028
your perfect Collins pedigree
lacked a bit of substance...

1172
01:40:42,195 --> 01:40:46,282
so I sent the werewolf
who bit Carolyn in her crib.

1173
01:40:51,871 --> 01:40:55,124
Just like I made David
no better than a bastard...

1174
01:40:55,291 --> 01:40:58,795
when I sent his mommy to the ocean floor
to have tea with the tuna.

1175
01:41:01,214 --> 01:41:02,799
And as for you, my love...

1176
01:41:04,884 --> 01:41:07,470
I killed your mother and father.

1177
01:41:10,390 --> 01:41:12,850
I cursed your family, my Barnabas.

1178
01:41:13,017 --> 01:41:14,978
They kept us apart.

1179
01:41:15,144 --> 01:41:17,855
They never understood, we're the same.

1180
01:41:18,022 --> 01:41:20,149
We're meant to be.

1181
01:41:20,316 --> 01:41:22,318
Leave him alone.

1182
01:41:25,113 --> 01:41:28,491
I think I'll kill you first, orphan.

1183
01:41:30,743 --> 01:41:32,829
David, get out!

1184
01:41:33,413 --> 01:41:35,164
Your quarrel is with me.

1185
01:41:35,331 --> 01:41:36,958
My quarrel is with all of you.

1186
01:41:37,542 --> 01:41:38,918
I'm warning you.

1187
01:41:39,335 --> 01:41:40,795
This is your last chance.

1188
01:41:41,337 --> 01:41:42,797
Let us go.

1189
01:41:42,964 --> 01:41:45,508
And what will you do if I don't,
you little bastard?

1190
01:41:46,426 --> 01:41:47,969
Not me.

1191
01:41:48,136 --> 01:41:49,512
My mom.

1192
01:42:23,379 --> 01:42:24,464
Go!

1193
01:42:38,978 --> 01:42:40,855
David, come on.

1194
01:42:43,316 --> 01:42:45,193
Willie, come on.

1195
01:43:06,464 --> 01:43:08,758
So this is how it ends.

1196
01:43:12,845 --> 01:43:14,597
So quiet...

1197
01:43:15,223 --> 01:43:17,183
as if you were asleep.

1198
01:43:18,601 --> 01:43:23,064
You know, there was a time
when I might have loved you.

1199
01:43:23,856 --> 01:43:26,651
We could have spent eternity together.

1200
01:43:27,443 --> 01:43:29,028
We still...

1201
01:43:29,779 --> 01:43:31,197
can.

1202
01:43:31,864 --> 01:43:34,117
You never wanted my love.

1203
01:43:34,784 --> 01:43:37,495
You wanted to possess me.

1204
01:43:37,662 --> 01:43:39,122
No.

1205
01:43:39,789 --> 01:43:42,041
I love you, Barnabas.

1206
01:43:42,959 --> 01:43:45,962
You cannot love, Angelique.

1207
01:43:47,004 --> 01:43:49,382
That is your curse.

1208
01:44:17,452 --> 01:44:18,494
Take it.

1209
01:44:45,688 --> 01:44:47,023
Victoria!

1210
01:44:47,190 --> 01:44:48,733
Victoria!

1211
01:45:00,912 --> 01:45:03,164
She said Widow's Hill.

1212
01:45:18,554 --> 01:45:20,723
What do we do now?

1213
01:45:21,599 --> 01:45:23,810
What we've always done.

1214
01:45:25,228 --> 01:45:26,813
Endure.

1215
01:46:01,472 --> 01:46:03,057
I thought I'd lost you.

1216
01:46:04,517 --> 01:46:05,935
You have lost me.

1217
01:46:07,937 --> 01:46:09,772
I live in the light, Barnabas.

1218
01:46:09,939 --> 01:46:11,774
You live in the shadows.

1219
01:46:11,941 --> 01:46:14,777
I'll grow old and die,
and you'll live forever.

1220
01:46:14,944 --> 01:46:16,946
We will find a way, my love.

1221
01:46:18,656 --> 01:46:20,533
There's only one way.

1222
01:46:20,700 --> 01:46:25,246
No. I will not see you suffer as I do.
Never.

1223
01:46:30,126 --> 01:46:31,294
No!

1224
01:47:03,659 --> 01:47:05,161
Oh, Victoria.

1225
01:47:05,661 --> 01:47:07,705
My sweet Victoria.

1226
01:47:17,757 --> 01:47:19,508
Victoria.

1227
01:47:26,182 --> 01:47:27,850
Josette.

1228
01:47:45,868 --> 01:47:50,289
<i>It is said that blood
is thicker than water.</i>

1229
01:47:50,456 --> 01:47:52,249
<i>It is what defines us.</i>

1230
01:47:52,416 --> 01:47:54,085
<i>Binds us.</i>

1231
01:47:54,251 --> 01:47:56,379
<i>Curses us.</i>

1232
01:47:56,545 --> 01:47:59,548
<i>My name is Barnabas Collins...</i>

1233
01:47:59,715 --> 01:48:03,886
<i>and my curse has finally been broken.</i>
