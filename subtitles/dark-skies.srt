I was having some kind of breakdown.

Daniel, I've got to show you something.

00:49:41,938 --> 00:49:44,399
So I started with the birds.

677
00:49:44,566 --> 00:49:47,360
And the best they can
understand it is that

678
00:49:47,527 --> 00:49:51,615
something is interfering
with the Earth's geomagnetic field,

679
00:49:51,781 --> 00:49:56,161
and... and that's causing
the birds to veer off course.

680
00:49:56,328 --> 00:49:58,848
Some people say that it has something
to do with the government,

681
00:49:58,872 --> 00:50:02,959
that they're testing some kind of
super-secret weapons technology.

And other people...

683
00:50:05,587 --> 00:50:08,256
...think it's something else,
something...

684
00:50:10,717 --> 00:50:12,302
...not from here.

685
00:50:15,388 --> 00:50:18,391

- No, it's more than hard to believe.

695

he was taken by aliens

this drawing online and copied it.

704
00:51:33,675 --> 00:51:36,553
And maybe he made
800 birds hit our house?

705
00:51:39,014 --> 00:51:42,058
I found a guy in the city who claims
to be an expert on this stuff.

706
00:51:42,225 --> 00:51:45,312

- No. No, no, no, no.

Well, what other explanation
do you have?

708
00:51:47,939 --> 00:51:51,234
Just because I can't explain something,
doesn't mean aliens are responsible.

in the suburbs, but...

885
01:05:12,493 --> 01:05:16,038

when they came around.

Dogs have a sense for them.

Kept me up at night, so, uh...

889
01:05:26,173 --> 01:05:31,262
...so I moved here to a building
that doesn't allow dogs.

Them?

893
01:05:46,777 --> 01:05:49,780
The Grays.
That's what they're called.

896
01:05:54,827 --> 01:05:59,290
There are three generally

01:05:59,457 --> 01:06:04,962
the Grays, Insectoids
and the Reptilians.

898
01:06:05,129 --> 01:06:10,009
But nine times out of ten, what people
report seeing are the Grays.

899
01:06:10,176 --> 01:06:14,388
In fact, I'm... I'm dubious
about the other two altogether.

900
01:06:14,555 --> 01:06:16,432
Especially the Reptilians.

901
01:06:16,599 --> 01:06:19,518
I don't think
those accounts are credible.

902
01:06:19,685 --> 01:06:24,106
Yeah. <font color="#D900D9">(CHUCKLES)</font>
That would make anyone skeptical.

I'm getting ahead of myself.

you actually are
experiencing an encounter.

906

Is... is that a test?

907
01:06:47,129 --> 01:06:50,883
Uh, just a series of questions.

908
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:53,427

Nope.

916
01:07:19,036 --> 01:07:22,665
Either of you heard
a ringing in your ears

917
01:07:22,831 --> 01:07:26,001

only inside your head?

<font color="#D900D9">(SOFTLY)</font> Yes

- Yes.
- Yes.

922
01:07:44,562 --> 01:07:49,441
Have you witnessed any abnormal behavior
by animals in your neighborhood?

923
01:07:52,778 --> 01:07:56,574
Three different flocks of birds
flew into our house the other day.

924
01:07:59,285 --> 01:08:01,662
I would say that qualifies.

925
01:08:01,829 --> 01:08:04,623
Have either of you
experienced any blackouts,

926
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:08,002
stretches of time
that you can't account for?

927
01:08:11,505 --> 01:08:13,340
And have you experienced a feeling

928
01:08:13,507 --> 01:08:18,095
that you might not be
in control of your own body?

929
01:08:18,262 --> 01:08:20,097
How do you know all this?

930
01:08:23,183 --> 01:08:25,686
You are not alone in this.

931
01:08:26,604 --> 01:08:30,190
Others have experienced
what you're going through

932
01:08:30,357 --> 01:08:34,528
and have struggled
the way you're struggling now.

933
01:08:35,613 --> 01:08:39,700
Why are the Grays, or whatever they are,
so interested in us?

934
01:08:39,867 --> 01:08:42,578
What makes us so special?

935
01:08:43,746 --> 01:08:45,831
Nothing.

936
01:08:45,998 --> 01:08:48,250
There's nothing special about you.

937
01:08:49,918 --> 01:08:51,128
I'm sorry.

938
01:08:51,295 --> 01:08:54,965
You were hoping
for a different answer.

939
01:08:55,132 --> 01:08:59,053
But this is beyond
our comprehension.

940
01:08:59,219 --> 01:09:02,222
What answer would a lab rat
understand from a scientist

941
01:09:02,389 --> 01:09:06,894
in a white coat putting electrodes
in its brain, giving it cancer?

942
01:09:08,103 --> 01:09:10,689
I've interviewed
literally thousands of people

943
01:09:10,856 --> 01:09:13,776
who claim to have been
visited by the Grays.

944
01:09:13,942 --> 01:09:16,862
They come from all walks of life.

945
01:09:17,029 --> 01:09:20,949
The only thing they have in common

946
01:09:21,116 --> 01:09:25,412
is that their lives have
become a living hell because of it.

947
01:09:26,747 --> 01:09:29,541
People think of aliens
as these beings

948
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:32,586
invading our planet
in some great cataclysm,

949
01:09:32,753 --> 01:09:38,550
destroying monuments,
stealing our natural resources.

950
01:09:38,717 --> 01:09:40,928
But it's not like that at all.

951
01:09:42,012 --> 01:09:46,266
The invasion... already happened.

952
01:09:48,894 --> 01:09:53,524
No one knows exactly when, but...

953
01:09:55,192 --> 01:09:57,403
...they're here.

954
01:09:58,028 --> 01:10:00,364
They've been here.

955
01:10:01,949 --> 01:10:06,203
The presence of the Grays
is now a fact of life.

956
01:10:06,370 --> 01:10:08,789
Like death and taxes.

957
01:10:11,834 --> 01:10:14,253
Do you know what they want?

958
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:17,172
They seem to be...

959
01:10:17,339 --> 01:10:21,427
...studying us, experimenting on us.

960
01:10:21,593 --> 01:10:26,348
One thing we know for sure is,
they use our fears against us.

961
01:10:26,515 --> 01:10:30,060
It can start like a...
a childish prank...

962
01:10:31,186 --> 01:10:36,316
...a mess in the kitchen
or things missing in the house.

963
01:10:36,483 --> 01:10:39,903
And before you know it, you're walking
through a full-blown nightmare.

964
01:10:42,072 --> 01:10:44,283
You probably already have implants.

965
01:10:44,450 --> 01:10:47,077
Implants?

966
01:10:49,163 --> 01:10:52,082
That's how they control you.

967
01:10:52,249 --> 01:10:54,585
Make you do things
you can't remember,

968
01:10:54,752 --> 01:10:57,588
make you see things
that aren't there.

<font color="#D900D9">(SIGHS)</font>

973

Yeah, there she is.

974
01:11:12,394 --> 01:11:14,772
This one didn't take as well.

975
01:11:14,938 --> 01:11:16,818
Skin's pretty irritated,
that happens sometimes.

976
01:11:16,857 --> 01:11:19,985
It's a... it's a rash or a bite.

977
01:11:20,152 --> 01:11:22,029
That's what they want you to think.

978
01:11:23,405 --> 01:11:24,907
The Grays...

979
01:11:26,158 --> 01:11:27,785
...hide what they do.

980
01:11:27,951 --> 01:11:31,538
Disguise the implants
as something perfectly normal.

981
01:11:32,539 --> 01:11:34,583
Most people don't even
know they have them.

982
01:11:36,418 --> 01:11:38,295
Well, can we remove it?

983
01:11:39,213 --> 01:11:40,297
No.

984
01:11:40,464 --> 01:11:43,842
No. Believe me, I've tried.

985
01:11:51,183 --> 01:11:52,893
Oh, my God.

986
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:57,648
Every time I think I'm getting it,
it seems to burrow in deeper.

We'll move. Pack everything
in the car and just drive away.

989
01:12:10,494 --> 01:12:12,996
These beings almost certainly

990
01:12:13,163 --> 01:12:17,543
came millions of light-years
to get here.

991
01:12:17,709 --> 01:12:19,628
Do you really think
moving to the next town

992
01:12:19,795 --> 01:12:23,382
or checking into a motel
will stop them from finding you?

993
01:12:25,217 --> 01:12:27,636
The events you've been experiencing,

994
01:12:27,803 --> 01:12:30,806
the disturbances in your home,
the blackouts,

995
01:12:30,973 --> 01:12:33,642
the marks on your bodies...

996
01:12:35,644 --> 01:12:38,605
...they are not the beginning
of something, Daniel.

997
01:12:39,773 --> 01:12:41,358
They are the end of something.

998
01:12:43,026 --> 01:12:45,279
It's like a countdown.

999
01:12:45,445 --> 01:12:49,074
The Grays will watch a family
for a long time

1000
01:12:49,241 --> 01:12:51,535
before they reveal themselves.

1001
01:12:51,702 --> 01:12:56,582
But once they do, it means they're
getting ready to take someone.

1002
01:12:57,416 --> 01:12:59,418
What are you talking about?

1003
01:13:00,836 --> 01:13:02,296
This is important.

1004
01:13:03,213 --> 01:13:07,050
Which member of your family did
the Grays first make contact with?

1005
01:13:07,968 --> 01:13:09,636
<font color="#808080">DANIEL:</font>
My youngest son, Sam.

1006
01:13:10,804 --> 01:13:12,723
<font color="#808080">POLLARD:</font>
Then Sam is in the most danger.

1007
01:13:14,141 --> 01:13:15,893
The Grays almost always abduct

1008
01:13:16,059 --> 01:13:18,228
the first family member
they showed an interest in.

1009
01:13:22,274 --> 01:13:23,609
So that's it?

1010
01:13:23,775 --> 01:13:26,111
- We just wait until they take our son?
- No.

1011
01:13:26,904 --> 01:13:29,865
You fight them
with everything you've got.

1012
01:13:30,032 --> 01:13:33,785
Your only hope is
to make it so difficult for them,

1013
01:13:33,952 --> 01:13:37,122
that they simply move on
to someone else.

1014
01:13:37,289 --> 01:13:39,875
Wait-wait-wait-wait, I'm sor...

1015
01:13:40,042 --> 01:13:41,043
That can work?

1016
01:13:41,793 --> 01:13:44,630
It has before, in some cases.

1017
01:13:44,796 --> 01:13:48,467
Yes. I've even heard of cases
where someone who's been taken

1018
01:13:48,634 --> 01:13:52,512
has eventually returned,
but you can't count on it.

1019
01:13:52,679 --> 01:13:56,350
Everything the Grays do is intended
to divide us from one another,

1020
01:13:56,516 --> 01:13:59,227
to isolate the one they've chosen.

1021
01:13:59,394 --> 01:14:04,816
Your greatest defense against them
is if your family is unified.

1022
01:14:04,983 --> 01:14:07,444
But you have to act quickly.
There isn't much time.

We'll go to the police.
We'll show them the surveillance video.

1026

have come into our house,

The police will think we're crazy, Lace.

1028
01:14:23,669 --> 01:14:25,087
- Hell, I think we're crazy.
- They have to believe us.

1029
01:14:25,253 --> 01:14:26,546
- It's the truth!
- You realize what will happen
