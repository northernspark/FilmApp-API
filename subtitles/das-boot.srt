1
00:00:00,991 --> 00:00:02,458
Hold this!

2
00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:13,399
Faster, faster!

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,074
Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

4
00:00:23,513 --> 00:00:25,572
Get a compress!

5
00:00:37,561 --> 00:00:40,724
Gotta shut down port diesel.
It's pulled loose!

6
00:00:40,997 --> 00:00:42,487
Keep full speed!

7
00:00:42,832 --> 00:00:46,233
Give it everything she's got!

8
00:00:47,137 --> 00:00:48,570
What's he going to do?

9
00:00:48,905 --> 00:00:49,837
Southern course...

10
00:00:50,106 --> 00:00:52,336
...moving toward the African coast.

11
00:01:01,251 --> 00:01:03,617
Damn!

12
00:01:07,657 --> 00:01:09,648
Flood tanks!

13
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,791
All men to bow!

14
00:01:22,672 --> 00:01:23,639
Down to 90 meters.

15
00:01:28,612 --> 00:01:31,547
- Bow plane jammed!
- Use manual rudder!

16
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,942
Bow plane stuck
in full down position!

17
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:46,957
Both engines stop.

18
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,464
All men aft!

19
00:01:56,306 --> 00:01:57,773
Hurry! Faster!

20
00:01:58,074 --> 00:01:59,405
Trim all to stern!

21
00:02:00,944 --> 00:02:02,343
Ballast pump down!

22
00:02:02,646 --> 00:02:03,476
Trim with air!

23
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,374
Still sinking.

24
00:02:08,652 --> 00:02:10,244
Load unchanged.

25
00:02:10,553 --> 00:02:12,612
Gotta lose weight!

26
00:02:12,922 --> 00:02:15,015
Pump 1000 litres!

27
00:02:17,794 --> 00:02:19,489
Shut him up, medic!

28
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:22,963
Main pump down!

29
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:25,868
Blow tanks?

30
00:02:26,336 --> 00:02:27,633
All back full!

31
00:02:34,511 --> 00:02:35,944
Boat not responding.

32
00:02:36,279 --> 00:02:37,769
Blow tanks!

33
00:02:39,649 --> 00:02:40,308
Blow front.

34
00:02:44,954 --> 00:02:46,785
Stop... now.

35
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:51,825
Why don't you stop!

36
00:02:53,697 --> 00:02:56,029
Give it whatever she's got, Chief!

37
00:02:56,332 --> 00:02:57,162
Blow 'em all!

38
00:02:59,335 --> 00:03:00,563
Come on up.

39
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:30,063
Boat is beyond control.

40
00:03:35,572 --> 00:03:36,334
200.

41
00:03:40,877 --> 00:03:41,775
210.

42
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:48,346
220 meters.

43
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,783
Beyond 230.

44
00:03:54,023 --> 00:03:55,547
240 meters.

45
00:03:58,495 --> 00:04:00,463
250 meters.

46
00:04:05,835 --> 00:04:07,302
My God!

47
00:04:08,938 --> 00:04:11,270
Do not turn...

48
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,968
...Thy face away from me.

49
00:05:05,128 --> 00:05:06,652
A shovelful of sand.

50
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:13,999
God threw a shovelful
of sand beneath our keel.

51
00:05:26,182 --> 00:05:27,547
280 meters.

52
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:31,344
This boat's amazing!

53
00:06:21,905 --> 00:06:23,736
Torpedo hatch taking water!

54
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,203
Taking water behind control panel!

55
00:06:31,414 --> 00:06:34,383
Taking water in motor bilge!

56
00:06:35,518 --> 00:06:37,543
Tube 5 taking water!

57
00:06:41,724 --> 00:06:42,850
What you need?

58
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:45,992
- Leakage plugs.
- In the bow.

59
00:06:48,364 --> 00:06:49,353
Exhaust valve?

60
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:52,192
Leakage plugs! Move!

61
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:57,836
Give me that lamp!

62
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,232
I need a wrench, damn it!

63
00:07:00,543 --> 00:07:02,101
Where are my reports?

64
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:05,138
Taking water... at tower frame!

65
00:07:05,448 --> 00:07:07,279
Where are the tools?

66
00:07:13,056 --> 00:07:15,616
- Where is it?
- Bilge pump!

67
00:07:16,592 --> 00:07:18,219
Motor control panels down!

68
00:07:18,528 --> 00:07:19,790
Diesel's all busted!

69
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,690
I demand proper reports!

70
00:07:28,404 --> 00:07:29,598
Where's it worst?

71
00:07:29,906 --> 00:07:32,841
Shaft valves and housing.

72
00:07:33,609 --> 00:07:36,077
Machinist, battery two...

73
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:38,210
...determine damages.

74
00:07:40,883 --> 00:07:43,181
Don't strip the crankshafts!

75
00:07:43,486 --> 00:07:44,578
Can't see a thing!

76
00:07:44,921 --> 00:07:47,651
Push... harder!

77
00:07:47,924 --> 00:07:49,050
I'm pushing!

78
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:52,325
Can't get the wedge in!

79
00:07:52,662 --> 00:07:54,254
Give me that hammer!

80
00:08:00,903 --> 00:08:03,269
Need more men aft?

81
00:08:03,573 --> 00:08:05,632
I'll find out!

82
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,141
- Damn it!
- Can I help?

83
00:08:09,445 --> 00:08:10,969
Hold the light!

84
00:08:11,914 --> 00:08:15,008
Father, don't forsake us.

85
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:18,046
Stupid asshole!

86
00:08:19,355 --> 00:08:20,253
Damn idiot!

87
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,759
I need the diesel room toolbox.

88
00:08:24,093 --> 00:08:25,685
Hurry!

89
00:08:26,496 --> 00:08:28,020
Where are the tools?

90
00:08:31,601 --> 00:08:32,659
Bigger wrench!

91
00:08:33,369 --> 00:08:35,200
Leakage in diesel bilge!

92
00:08:44,347 --> 00:08:47,544
Tighten them carefully.
Don't break the bolts.

93
00:08:49,552 --> 00:08:50,644
Cooling pipe leaking!

94
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,187
Get down there
and tighten those valves!

95
00:08:59,962 --> 00:09:02,226
Give me that timber!

96
00:09:07,537 --> 00:09:10,267
More plugs... hurry!

97
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:24,782
Gently, men.

98
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:38,396
Taking water fast in stern.

99
00:09:38,701 --> 00:09:42,899
All hull valves burst.
Cooling system down.

100
00:09:43,172 --> 00:09:47,666
Compressors dislodged.
Shaft valves taking water.

101
00:09:49,846 --> 00:09:51,939
What about fuel leaks?

102
00:09:52,281 --> 00:09:53,248
Can't tell yet.

103
00:09:53,516 --> 00:09:56,451
- Anything else?
- Battery cells are cracked.

104
00:09:56,752 --> 00:09:58,583
They can't take this!

105
00:10:04,827 --> 00:10:06,089
Acid in the bilge.

106
00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:10,092
Neutralize with lime wash.
Count drained cells.

107
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,425
Get battery connectors, hurry!

108
00:10:31,988 --> 00:10:32,750
Over here!

109
00:10:33,055 --> 00:10:35,421
I need plugs and a hammer!

110
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:43,093
- Here it is.
- Thanks, Lieutenant.

111
00:10:56,145 --> 00:10:57,942
Calm down.

112
00:11:06,022 --> 00:11:07,148
Tell the Chief!

113
00:11:07,456 --> 00:11:11,722
Taking water in motor room.
Rising above torpedo tubes!

114
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,467
Careful!

115
00:11:29,345 --> 00:11:30,869
24 cells drained.

116
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,978
24 cells. Holy shit!

117
00:11:43,593 --> 00:11:45,652
We're way short of connectors!

118
00:11:49,932 --> 00:11:53,493
He's got to bridge those damaged cells.

119
00:11:53,936 --> 00:11:55,233
Or else we've had it.

120
00:11:58,174 --> 00:12:00,369
Can't tighten it. Can't see.

121
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,507
Lieutenant, lights!

122
00:12:03,913 --> 00:12:06,404
If we don't fix this, we're goners!

123
00:12:15,858 --> 00:12:18,349
To the right, more to the right!

124
00:12:26,068 --> 00:12:27,228
Wire!

125
00:12:27,903 --> 00:12:29,700
I need wire for bridging!

126
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,875
Move it, we need wire!
Hurry up!

127
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,310
The Chief needs wire.
Look for wire!

128
00:12:44,687 --> 00:12:46,416
Move it! Search for wire!

129
00:12:46,756 --> 00:12:49,122
Incredible torpedoes in these tubes!

130
00:12:50,226 --> 00:12:52,592
25,000 Marks apiece.

131
00:12:52,862 --> 00:12:54,420
And we can't find...

132
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,197
...a piece of wire.

133
00:12:56,532 --> 00:12:59,262
Some old wire worth 50 pennies!

134
00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:03,729
Periscope hydraulics jammed.

135
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,065
Can't be moved manually, either.

136
00:13:09,545 --> 00:13:10,603
Wire!

137
00:13:11,714 --> 00:13:13,443
Finally<i>,</i> something!

138
00:13:13,749 --> 00:13:14,977
Pliers!

139
00:13:28,631 --> 00:13:29,791
Leaks stopped.

140
00:13:35,971 --> 00:13:36,903
Good, Johann.

141
00:13:41,577 --> 00:13:43,010
Really good.

142
00:13:48,584 --> 00:13:51,018
Now, get out of those wet rags.

143
00:14:01,997 --> 00:14:03,965
Now let's get it out...

144
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,291
...this water's got to go!

145
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,797
First, into the control room bilge...

146
00:14:10,806 --> 00:14:11,830
...and then out.

147
00:14:18,614 --> 00:14:20,912
Faster! Let's get rid of it!

148
00:14:29,792 --> 00:14:32,454
And scoop... and scoop!

149
00:14:40,002 --> 00:14:43,199
Get with it.
No falling asleep back there!

150
00:14:50,012 --> 00:14:52,003
3 more cells... starboard.

151
00:15:04,627 --> 00:15:06,060
Where do we stand?

152
00:15:06,796 --> 00:15:09,560
Almost done. 3 cells to go.

153
00:15:22,244 --> 00:15:24,974
Make way for the Chief.

154
00:15:51,974 --> 00:15:54,465
Entire compass system is down...

155
00:15:56,378 --> 00:15:59,176
...probably the sonar, too.

156
00:15:59,482 --> 00:16:01,074
Radio is totally out.

157
00:16:03,886 --> 00:16:05,478
Quite a mess.

158
00:16:08,324 --> 00:16:09,757
Can we surface?

159
00:16:15,798 --> 00:16:17,231
Any chance at all?

160
00:16:24,273 --> 00:16:26,332
Good question.

161
00:16:32,114 --> 00:16:34,947
Some air may be left
in the ballast tanks...

162
00:16:35,918 --> 00:16:37,545
...from all that blowing.

163
00:16:40,122 --> 00:16:42,181
That might help us.

164
00:16:42,558 --> 00:16:45,152
With every last bit of air pressure...

165
00:16:50,633 --> 00:16:51,964
...maybe...

166
00:16:56,372 --> 00:16:58,840
We've got to reduce our weight.

167
00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:02,704
That water has to get out.

168
00:17:09,852 --> 00:17:11,820
Might work. It just might!

169
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,381
Aft is almost bailed.

170
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:25,193
It could work...

171
00:17:25,534 --> 00:17:27,263
...by hand into tanks...

172
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:28,696
...then with main pump...

173
00:17:28,971 --> 00:17:31,667
...and air pressure,
the water's pushed out!

174
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:33,668
Main pump?

175
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,000
Can do.

176
00:17:40,082 --> 00:17:42,175
Then we go for broke.

177
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:45,252
Blow tanks, and...

178
00:17:47,022 --> 00:17:48,751
We'll get only one try.

179
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,049
When?

180
00:17:52,394 --> 00:17:54,419
Once everything's repaired.

181
00:17:54,697 --> 00:17:56,358
In 6 to 8 hours.

182
00:17:58,667 --> 00:18:01,465
- CO2 content?
- 1.8 percent.

183
00:18:02,705 --> 00:18:04,297
We got enough oxygen?

184
00:18:05,074 --> 00:18:06,268
No.

185
00:18:09,378 --> 00:18:11,938
Pass out oxygen masks as needed...

186
00:18:12,281 --> 00:18:14,112
...men off duty to their bunks.

187
00:19:26,689 --> 00:19:27,951
How's he doing?

188
00:19:28,257 --> 00:19:29,884
Hard to tell.

189
00:19:48,877 --> 00:19:50,640
Doesn't look good.

190
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:31,886
So<i>,</i> Pilgrim...

191
00:20:33,489 --> 00:20:34,649
...all okay?

192
00:20:34,957 --> 00:20:36,982
Yes, Captain.

193
00:20:37,326 --> 00:20:39,260
It's all okay.

194
00:20:42,698 --> 00:20:44,791
How are things aft?

195
00:20:45,534 --> 00:20:47,695
Moving along, Captain.

196
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:52,438
Guess I'll show my face then, huh?

197
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,508
Be careful.

198
00:21:50,465 --> 00:21:52,126
All right here?

199
00:21:52,434 --> 00:21:54,664
Okay. Doing fine.

200
00:22:00,108 --> 00:22:03,737
Sure, Captain. It'll work out.

201
00:22:11,653 --> 00:22:13,314
How's it going?

202
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:18,350
Got to change two more bearings.

203
00:23:24,393 --> 00:23:25,917
Do you want some glucose?

204
00:24:07,135 --> 00:24:08,568
Crazy idea...

205
00:24:09,871 --> 00:24:12,101
...to ram us through this strait.

206
00:24:13,675 --> 00:24:15,734
It was bound to go wrong.

207
00:24:21,116 --> 00:24:22,947
He knew it.

208
00:24:24,786 --> 00:24:27,482
That old fox knew it all along.

209
00:24:32,694 --> 00:24:36,357
Since he got that radiogram...

210
00:24:37,099 --> 00:24:39,727
...ordering us to break through.

211
00:24:42,437 --> 00:24:46,237
That's why he wanted us off the boat...

212
00:24:46,575 --> 00:24:48,133
...in Vigo.

213
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:56,183
There was no chance to get through.

214
00:25:11,967 --> 00:25:15,903
He wanted to make us believe
it was possible...

215
00:25:16,772 --> 00:25:18,330
...with a simple trick.

216
00:25:23,011 --> 00:25:26,708
"Drop down and glide through"...

217
00:25:31,653 --> 00:25:34,213
Not a bad trick...

218
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:38,991
...except that it had to work.

219
00:25:46,134 --> 00:25:49,797
Will we ever surface, Chief?

220
00:25:58,647 --> 00:26:00,080
I don't know.

221
00:26:50,065 --> 00:26:51,589
I'm sorry.

222
00:26:53,902 --> 00:26:55,870
Is it hopeless?

223
00:26:59,774 --> 00:27:02,436
It's been 15 hours.

224
00:27:10,719 --> 00:27:12,482
He's not going to pull it off.

225
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,600
I'm sorry.

226
00:27:45,554 --> 00:27:47,852
I asked for it.

227
00:27:53,895 --> 00:27:57,490
"To be heading into the inexorable...

228
00:27:59,434 --> 00:28:03,700
...where no mother will care for us...

229
00:28:05,106 --> 00:28:08,598
...no woman crosses our path...

230
00:28:10,245 --> 00:28:14,545
...where only reality reigns...
with cruelty and grandeur."

231
00:28:25,994 --> 00:28:28,360
I was drunk with those words.

232
00:28:35,437 --> 00:28:38,167
Well, this is reality.

233
00:29:29,357 --> 00:29:31,416
Reporting to the Captain.

234
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:38,093
Electric motor fixed.

235
00:29:39,534 --> 00:29:41,695
Main pump fixed.

236
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:44,397
Water can be pumped into tanks...

237
00:29:46,608 --> 00:29:49,543
...then blown out with compressed air.

238
00:29:50,779 --> 00:29:52,610
Compass ready.

239
00:29:53,882 --> 00:29:55,611
Sonar ready.

240
00:30:12,033 --> 00:30:13,864
Good, Chief.

241
00:30:29,651 --> 00:30:31,482
Take a rest now.

242
00:30:40,261 --> 00:30:42,491
Still got a few small problems.

243
00:31:28,476 --> 00:31:30,910
All you need is good people.

244
00:31:35,183 --> 00:31:36,673
Good people.

245
00:31:41,356 --> 00:31:42,755
Listen up.

246
00:31:46,394 --> 00:31:48,419
We're going to blow tanks now...

247
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:51,621
...to see if we can lift our butt.

248
00:31:55,236 --> 00:31:56,328
If we do...

249
00:31:57,405 --> 00:31:59,532
...it might get uncomfortable again.

250
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:03,710
Lots of traffic up there.

251
00:32:09,184 --> 00:32:10,776
So, all we can do...

252
00:32:11,886 --> 00:32:14,184
...is pray those diesels start up.

253
00:32:15,657 --> 00:32:18,148
Then full speed ahead and off we go...

254
00:32:18,893 --> 00:32:20,724
...out of this crater...

255
00:32:21,796 --> 00:32:23,525
...and back home.

256
00:32:25,433 --> 00:32:26,798
If it works...

257
00:32:28,336 --> 00:32:30,804
...half a bottle of beer for everyone!

258
00:32:34,909 --> 00:32:37,537
We just might get lucky.

259
00:32:40,281 --> 00:32:42,306
They're not expecting us.

260
00:32:49,924 --> 00:32:51,357
Well, men...

261
00:32:53,862 --> 00:32:55,386
...are we ready?

262
00:33:00,902 --> 00:33:02,563
Contact bearings?

263
00:33:02,904 --> 00:33:04,064
No contact.

264
00:33:05,173 --> 00:33:07,539
Prepare to surface,
rescue gear ready.

265
00:33:07,876 --> 00:33:09,434
Switch to red lights.

266
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,271
Man your diving stations.

267
00:33:38,673 --> 00:33:40,140
Blow tanks.

268
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,949
Boat rising!

269
00:34:59,153 --> 00:35:01,212
Quiet men! Calm down!

270
00:35:12,266 --> 00:35:13,893
270 meters.

271
00:35:16,137 --> 00:35:17,832
First watch, get ready.

272
00:35:18,773 --> 00:35:20,604
260 meters.

273
00:35:27,548 --> 00:35:29,209
250 meters.

274
00:35:38,226 --> 00:35:39,921
240 meters.

275
00:35:46,034 --> 00:35:47,763
230 meters.

276
00:35:53,408 --> 00:35:55,069
220.

277
00:36:35,516 --> 00:36:37,006
Hatch is open.

278
00:36:51,099 --> 00:36:52,657
How about the engines?

279
00:36:58,272 --> 00:36:59,534
Both diesels.

280
00:37:01,342 --> 00:37:03,401
Now everything hinges on this.

281
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,500
I think...

282
00:37:30,905 --> 00:37:32,395
...it's running!

283
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,009
Who says you can't make something
out of nothing?

284
00:37:58,132 --> 00:37:59,861
They won't get us this time!

285
00:38:00,168 --> 00:38:01,533
Not again!

286
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:07,773
Hang in there, damn it!

287
00:38:08,409 --> 00:38:10,070
Hang in there!

288
00:38:10,878 --> 00:38:14,143
3 degrees to starboard.
Course 320 degrees.

289
00:38:15,416 --> 00:38:17,145
There he goes again!

290
00:38:21,756 --> 00:38:23,849
They don't notice us.

291
00:38:24,158 --> 00:38:26,991
They're all asleep in their bunks.

292
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,226
No, you know what?

293
00:38:33,801 --> 00:38:36,929
They're at the casino,
celebrating our sinking!

294
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:26,613
Cheers, guys!
Here's to getting home!

295
00:40:03,557 --> 00:40:05,889
As long as the diesels hold up...

296
00:40:09,497 --> 00:40:11,590
...and with a little bit of luck...

297
00:40:16,904 --> 00:40:19,031
...we'll make it home.

298
00:40:25,046 --> 00:40:29,380
The 3rd Submarine Flotilla welcomes
our returning sailors.

299
00:41:02,316 --> 00:41:03,783
All engines stop.

300
00:41:04,051 --> 00:41:05,313
Let go aft line.

301
00:41:31,912 --> 00:41:34,176
- Thanks, Hinrich.
- Don't mention it.

302
00:41:34,482 --> 00:41:36,143
The sun's shining.

303
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:37,576
Lift it!

304
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,931
All right? Almost there.

305
00:41:54,305 --> 00:42:00,483
