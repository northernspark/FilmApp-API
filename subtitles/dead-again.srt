00:03:59.00,00:04:01.03
Come on in, Mr Baker.

00:04:02.83,00:04:07.62
As you can see,[br]I've become quite a fan of yours.

00:04:10.38,00:04:12.42
I'm flattered.

00:04:19.98,00:04:23.75
Is that why you've asked me to[br]come down to death row, Mr Strauss?

00:04:23.86,00:04:28.73
- To tell me what a fan you are?[br]- I'd like you to print something.

00:04:28.82,00:04:30.85
After all,

00:04:34.78,00:04:37.24
you're so good at that.

00:04:39.25,00:04:41.28
I'd like you to print

00:04:42.50,00:04:47.12
that I said I loved my wife.

00:04:48.47,00:04:52.75
- You loved your wife.[br]- And that I'll love her...

00:04:54.56,00:04:56.13
forever.

00:04:56.22,00:05:00.14
Of course. Forever. All right.

00:05:01.56,00:05:03.60
Thank you, Mr Baker.

00:05:06.78,00:05:09.14
Aren't you afraid of dying?

00:05:09.24,00:05:14.94
To die is different[br]from what anyone supposes.

00:05:15.04,00:05:18.53
- And luckier.[br]- That a line from your opera?

00:05:21.88,00:05:24.24
It's Walt Whitman.

00:05:24.34,00:05:28.25
I can't take credit[br]for everything, Mr Baker.

00:05:29.59,00:05:32.59
You really believe[br]that you're lucky to die?

00:05:34.64,00:05:38.47
What I believe, Mr Baker,

00:05:38.56,00:05:45.39
is that this is all far from over.

00:05:52.74,00:05:56.32
But you still killed her.[br]Didn't you, Mr Strauss?

00:06:08.01,00:06:10.58
OK, Strauss, let's go.

00:07:00.82,00:07:04.56
No! Stop him! Stop him!

00:07:08.16,00:07:09.98
Stop him!

00:07:10.08,00:07:13.03
These are for you!

00:07:48.33,00:07:51.82
You're all right, child.[br]I'm not going to hurt you.

00:08:04.26,00:08:09.17
Here we go. Keep it going![br]Keep it going! There!

00:08:10.35,00:08:14.81
We found her two nights ago[br]trying to climb over the gates.

00:08:14.90,00:08:17.81
Since then she hasn't[br]spoken a single word.

00:08:17.90,00:08:23.36
She won't eat. And when she does[br]sleep, she has violent nightmares.

00:08:23.45,00:08:27.28
- Call the police.[br]- They've already been here, Father.

00:08:27.37,00:08:30.49
They want to take her[br]to County Hospital.

00:08:31.54,00:08:34.79
Last night Sister Constance -[br]she is in the next room -

00:08:34.88,00:08:38.00
she heard the woman call[br]this word out in her sleep.

00:08:38.09,00:08:39.92
- "Die-sher"?[br]- "Dish-er".

00:08:40.05,00:08:43.42
- Sounds like nothing to me.[br]- Father...

00:08:43.51,00:08:46.80
The woman belongs downtown!

00:08:46.89,00:08:51.09
Father, every night before bed,[br]she blocks her door with a chair,

00:08:51.23,00:08:54.18
and if you had only heard[br]this woman scream!

00:08:54.28,00:08:58.90
- I don't have to hear her scream.[br]- I will not abandon her, Father.

00:08:58.99,00:09:03.69
She's not spending[br]another night here and that's final.

00:09:05.75,00:09:07.78
But, I see no reason

00:09:07.87,00:09:11.78
why we can't have someone look for[br]her family in the meantime.

00:09:11.88,00:09:14.58
But we don't have the money[br]to hire anybody.

00:09:14.67,00:09:17.54
The man I'm thinking of[br]would do it for nothing.

00:09:17.63,00:09:21.41
He grew up here. He was a policeman.

00:09:22.06,00:09:25.63
He worked in missing persons[br]for some time.

00:09:27.31,00:09:29.79
How's that for a name you can trust?

00:09:32.15,00:09:36.60
Pete? It's Mike.[br]Don't run the ad. I found Carlisle.

00:09:36.70,00:09:39.77
I'm on my way to him right now.

00:09:39.87,00:09:43.73
- You're on the wrong side![br]- Thanks, pal!

00:09:44.25,00:09:46.61
If your wife's cousin calls,

00:09:46.71,00:09:49.99
just don't take what she says[br]too seriously.

00:09:50.09,00:09:51.91
Yeah, I took her out.

00:09:53.38,00:09:56.42
We went and had some lunch[br]and we kind of...

00:09:56.51,00:09:59.92
We went back to her place and...

00:10:00.01,00:10:02.41
No, we're not going out again.

00:10:03.60,00:10:06.97
Tell your wife there's nothing[br]wrong with her cousin,

00:10:07.06,00:10:09.51
it's just she...[br]I don't want to...

00:10:10.48,00:10:13.81
I'm not looking for Miss Right.[br]I'm looking for Miss Right Now.

00:10:13.90,00:10:15.73
Thank you.

00:10:26.96,00:10:30.20
- Cozy Carlisle?[br]- Try the freezer.

00:10:30.30,00:10:32.33
Thank you.

00:10:43.14,00:10:45.22
Fuck you. I'm on a break.

00:10:45.31,00:10:48.14
Mr Carlisle,[br]I've been retained by a law firm

00:10:48.23,00:10:52.23
to find you and tell you that[br]Myron Spargo died last month.

00:10:52.32,00:10:56.94
- Who the fuck's Myron Spargo?[br]- He was a patient of yours.

00:10:57.03,00:10:59.78
I had a lot of patients.[br]Now, beat it.

00:10:59.87,00:11:02.78
This one left you $11,000.

00:11:02.87,00:11:06.37
- Myron![br]- Yeah, Myron.

00:11:06.46,00:11:10.04
- Myron T Spargo.[br]- Plumbing contractor.

00:11:10.13,00:11:13.67
Lived in San Marino[br]with his wife, Karen or Sharon.

00:11:13.76,00:11:17.70
Karen.[br]She must be very lonely right now.

00:11:18.77,00:11:22.89
Jesus! 11,000,[br]that's a lot of grateful.

00:11:23.86,00:11:27.27
- You want a cigarette?[br]- What? No. I don't smoke.

00:11:27.36,00:11:30.56
You've looked at this pack[br]three times in the last minute.

00:11:30.65,00:11:33.19
- What?[br]- You use that pen like a cigarette.

00:11:33.28,00:11:35.68
You helped Myron Spargo quit smoking?

00:11:35.78,00:11:39.82
No. Myron was impotent. Imagine that.

00:11:39.91,00:11:43.49
A man lays pipe for a living,[br]can't get it up at home.

00:11:44.38,00:11:47.12
He had some hard-on[br]when he made out his will.

00:11:47.21,00:11:51.33
Hey, thumb-dick,[br]I was a damn good shrink.

00:11:51.43,00:11:56.13
In 16 years I worked with a[br]lot of people through a lot of shit.

00:11:56.22,00:11:59.80
OK, I slept with a patient or two.

00:11:59.89,00:12:02.97
- I still cared about them.[br]- OK.

00:12:03.06,00:12:05.73
I loved being a doctor.

00:12:05.82,00:12:09.44
I used to not charge[br]half my patients.

00:12:10.91,00:12:16.03
Then the fucking State comes along,[br]they send some bitch undercover,

00:12:16.12,00:12:18.15
and I'm fucked.

00:12:18.83,00:12:21.23
It ain't fair, is it?

00:12:21.33,00:12:25.41
Why don't you call Opperman-Crowe?

00:12:26.01,00:12:28.68
Set up an appointment,[br]sign the paperwork,

00:12:28.76,00:12:31.59
they'll cut you a cheque[br]for the 8,800 there.

00:12:31.68,00:12:34.55
Excuse me.[br]What happened to the 11,000?

00:12:34.64,00:12:36.84
Well, 11 less my commission.

00:12:36.93,00:12:41.43
That is, unless you got a problem[br]with that, Sigmund.

00:12:43.48,00:12:46.64
Could I use your phone?

00:12:46.74,00:12:49.22
- Help yourself.[br]- Thanks.

00:12:49.32,00:12:52.57
- Mr Church?[br]- Yeah?

00:12:53.66,00:12:58.20
Someone's either a smoker or a[br]nonsmoker, there's no in-between.

00:12:58.88,00:13:02.57
The trick is to find out[br]which one you are and be that.

00:13:02.67,00:13:07.29
- Well, I'm trying to quit.[br]- Don't tell me you're trying.

00:13:07.38,00:13:10.67
People who say that are pussies[br]who cannot commit.

00:13:10.76,00:13:13.88
Find out which one you are.[br]Be that. That's it.

00:13:13.98,00:13:16.72
If you're a nonsmoker, you'll know.

00:13:16.81,00:13:19.38
Thank you. Nice place you got here.

00:13:19.48,00:13:21.31
Fuckin' fruitcake.

00:13:27.11,00:13:30.02
Somewhere someone is very worried[br]about this woman.

00:13:31.45,00:13:35.03
All right. I'll give her a lift[br]to County Hospital.

00:13:35.12,00:13:38.16
That's really all I got time to do[br]right now.

00:13:40.63,00:13:45.58
Maybe on the way I'll stop and have a[br]buddy of mine at the paper

00:13:45.68,00:13:49.09
take her picture,[br]run it in the morning edition.

00:13:49.18,00:13:53.84
- How's that sound?[br]- That sounds wonderful. Thank you.

00:13:53.94,00:13:56.18
That sounds wonderful. All right.

00:14:10.45,00:14:13.15
So only one glove, one ring...

00:14:24.80,00:14:28.38
I was checking the labels to get a[br]line on where she bought them.

00:14:28.47,00:14:32.13
And how did the labels[br]smell, Mr Church?

00:14:32.23,00:14:34.26
Expensive.

00:14:43.91,00:14:47.27
Perfume. I mean...

00:14:49.45,00:14:51.49
Mike Church.

00:14:54.33,00:14:57.33
This is a Claddagh ring,[br]lrish wedding band.

00:14:57.42,00:15:00.71
If you wear it with the crown up,[br]it means you're taken.

00:15:00.80,00:15:03.75
Crown down, you're not.[br]How were you wearing it?

00:15:03.84,00:15:07.38
The policeman had her take it off[br]so he could see it.

00:15:07.47,00:15:09.87
What about the other glove?

00:15:09.98,00:15:13.43
She only had the one on[br]when we found her.

00:15:22.07,00:15:23.98
I'll help her get ready.

00:15:24.08,00:15:27.03
If you see anything[br]you recognise, holler.

00:15:27.12,00:15:29.40
I know you can't holler per se,

00:15:29.50,00:15:33.99
so maybe just you give[br]a wave or something.

00:15:36.63,00:15:39.11
It sure is nice to be with someone

00:15:39.22,00:15:41.29
you don't feel you have[br]to yak to all the time.

00:15:48.31,00:15:52.72
Smile, sweetheart. That's a girl!

00:15:54.61,00:15:57.60
You're really just going to[br]dump her off at County?

00:15:57.70,00:16:01.06
- Why don't you take her home?[br]- She's not a stray dog, Pete.

00:16:01.16,00:16:04.40
Besides, you never[br]bring women back to your place.

00:16:04.49,00:16:07.86
They might mess with your stuff.[br]"Oh, my stuff!"

00:16:07.96,00:16:13.24
At least you won't forget her name.[br]She's already forgotten it for you.

00:16:15.26,00:16:18.71
Count to 30, take her out[br]of the fixer, put her in the water.

00:16:18.80,00:16:22.21
I'll be writing the caption.[br]Let's start.

00:16:22.31,00:16:26.72
- Thank you so much.[br]- You're in good hands, sweetheart.

00:16:26.81,00:16:30.50
Mikey's a pro. He can find anything.

00:16:31.40,00:16:34.47
Same thing happened to me once.[br]Two years ago.

00:16:35.36,00:16:39.69
This mailman in Lawndale freaked out,[br]chopped up his family with a trimmer.

00:16:39.78,00:16:44.49
Then either cos he heard a voice[br]or maybe he felt bad,

00:16:44.58,00:16:47.11
- he cut off his own arms.[br]- Pete.

00:16:47.21,00:16:50.49
- Had to dial 911 with his nose.[br]- Pete!

00:16:50.59,00:16:53.58
- What?[br]- I know there's a point to this.

00:16:53.67,00:16:58.38
It's coming! I was the first shooter[br]to show up at the scene.

00:16:58.47,00:17:02.59
I take one look, I pass out.[br]I passed out cold.

00:17:02.68,00:17:09.80
I come to, I had no idea who I was.[br]I didn't even know my own family.

00:17:09.90,00:17:12.89
It was the scariest thing[br]that ever happened to me.

00:17:12.99,00:17:15.23
Then one morning I wake up

00:17:15.32,00:17:18.69
and my little girl is[br]standing beside the bed.

00:17:18.78,00:17:22.40
And she looks at me and says,[br]"I love you."

00:17:24.00,00:17:29.53
I just looked at her[br]and in about two seconds

00:17:31.92,00:17:34.21
my whole life came back to me.

00:17:35.68,00:17:39.84
So, you hang in there, sweetheart.

00:17:39.93,00:17:45.51
Sooner or later, it'll all come back.[br]Scout's honour.

00:17:46.90,00:17:49.60
I got to get her to the hospital.

00:17:49.69,00:17:51.60
I got this thing to write.

00:17:51.69,00:17:54.40
- Thank you.[br]- Sure.

00:18:07.38,00:18:10.45
My name and number[br]are going to be in the paper,

00:18:10.55,00:18:14.96
so when somebody sees your picture,[br]I'll come get you.

00:18:30.78,00:18:33.60
We're talking one night[br]at the most here.

00:18:34.12,00:18:37.53
That's my fucking cookie, bitch![br]That's my cookie!

00:18:40.50,00:18:43.41
Give it to me! Give it to me!

00:18:43.50,00:18:47.33
- It's not my problem![br]- Take her to the hospital.

00:18:47.42,00:18:51.36
- I took her. It was terrible.[br]- We cannot deal with her.

00:19:01.56,00:19:05.97
I'm sure you'll find this place[br]almost as nice as County Hospital.

00:19:07.94,00:19:10.90
My goodness![br]The maid hasn't been.

00:19:10.99,00:19:14.57
I'm sure you won't be stuck here[br]too long.

00:19:14.66,00:19:18.35
This place was spotless[br]when I left it a year ago.

00:19:18.46,00:19:23.37
Somebody's going to see[br]your picture in the paper and

00:19:23.96,00:19:28.83
they'll come find you[br]and you'll know what your name is.

00:19:30.09,00:19:32.84
It's OK.[br]Can I get rid of this for you?

00:19:32.93,00:19:35.60
Relieve you of hospital life.[br]Are you faint?

00:19:35.68,00:19:38.88
You're hungry, right?[br]You haven't eaten all day.

00:19:39.81,00:19:42.97
If you get hungry,[br]the fridge is there.

00:19:43.57,00:19:47.98
Trudy, it's 10:00, for Christ's sake![br]Will you shut up?

00:19:50.07,00:19:54.65
We're friends. Music, I love it.[br]But her music? No.

00:19:55.75,00:19:58.07
The bedroom's in here.

00:19:58.17,00:20:00.41
The bathroom's here.[br]The closet's there.

00:20:00.50,00:20:03.20
There's a sweatshirt[br]in the bottom drawer,

00:20:03.30,00:20:06.25
in case you want[br]something to sleep in,

00:20:06.34,00:20:09.88
and some old clothes[br]if you want to change in the morning.

00:20:09.97,00:20:12.25
Help yourself.

00:20:12.35,00:20:14.21
That's a beauty, isn't it?

00:20:14.31,00:20:18.43
The desk and bookcase in there[br]are from the same period.

00:20:24.78,00:20:26.81
Good night.

00:20:30.16,00:20:32.19
Welcome to...

00:20:39.71,00:20:43.08
"The desk and bookshelf in there[br]are from the same period."

00:20:43.17,00:20:45.21
What an asshole!

00:20:58.86,00:21:00.89
These are for you.

00:21:02.61,00:21:05.94
What's going on? Open the door!

00:21:07.57,00:21:09.61
Take it easy.

00:21:10.70,00:21:14.48
You're OK. It's OK. Take it easy.

00:21:36.40,00:21:40.98
I'm not telling you anything.[br]You tell me what her ring looks like.

00:21:41.07,00:21:43.10
A coiled serpent.

00:21:44.78,00:21:47.77
Skull and crossbones? Yeah?

00:21:48.45,00:21:51.74
Matches the tattoo?[br]Thanks for calling, Floyd.

00:21:51.83,00:21:55.61
The entire male[br]population of LA's checked in.

00:21:55.71,00:21:57.74
This is better than video dating.

00:21:58.88,00:22:02.54
- Excuse me, Mr Church?[br]- Yeah. Can I help you?

00:22:02.63,00:22:04.83
Actually, I'm here to help you.

00:22:04.93,00:22:07.71
Who are you supposed[br]to be, her grandfather?

00:22:07.81,00:22:11.88
Not her grandfather,[br]nor her grandmother, for that matter.

00:22:11.98,00:22:16.22
In fact, I'm no relation at all.[br]My name is Franklyn Madson.

00:22:16.32,00:22:21.19
That's a very handsome chair.[br]That's a Heywood-Wakefield.

00:22:21.28,00:22:23.44
I'll give you $45 for that right now.

00:22:23.53,00:22:26.57
It's a Stickley, worth $250.[br]What can I do for you?

00:22:26.66,00:22:29.14
A glass of water would be lovely.

00:22:29.25,00:22:33.99
Your stairs are rather steep.[br]The long climb's worn me out a bit.

00:22:36.30,00:22:40.37
I see cases like this all the time.

00:22:41.34,00:22:43.25
A person experiences a trauma

00:22:43.35,00:22:46.13
and they want to erase it[br]from their minds.

00:22:46.22,00:22:49.59
The trouble is, they erase[br]everything else along with it.

00:22:50.31,00:22:53.14
- You a shrink?[br]- No, not exactly.

00:22:53.23,00:22:55.68
I'm a hypnotist.

00:22:55.78,00:22:59.85
Here's the water, there's[br]the door. Sorry about the stairs.

00:23:03.62,00:23:05.28
Tastes a bit like bourbon.

00:23:05.37,00:23:11.62
It's simply a matter of regressing[br]the young lady back to a happier time

00:23:11.71,00:23:14.74
and then asking her who she is.

00:23:14.84,00:23:19.42
Your hand is feeling[br]very light, my dear,

00:23:19.51,00:23:23.75
so light that I'm afraid[br]if I were to let go of it,

00:23:24.64,00:23:28.63
it would just float up,[br]all on its own.

00:23:31.77,00:23:34.52
- Who gave you permission?[br]- No.

00:23:34.61,00:23:39.27
She's perfectly all right.[br]Continue to relax, my dear.

00:23:39.36,00:23:43.82
Tell yourself[br]you're going deeper and deeper

00:23:43.91,00:23:47.77
into a state of hypnosis. That's it.

00:23:48.83,00:23:51.58
That's right.

00:23:51.67,00:23:55.08
That's very nice.

00:23:55.17,00:23:57.00
Good.

00:23:57.84,00:24:01.13
My dear, let us go back.

00:24:02.93,00:24:05.92
Tell me, has something...

00:24:06.02,00:24:08.09
Somebody help me!

00:24:13.49,00:24:17.40
- Is she still under?[br]- No.

00:24:21.99,00:24:26.16
What made you scream?[br]Can you talk now?

00:24:29.13,00:24:33.45
At least we know she does talk.[br]Rather well, in fact.

00:24:33.55,00:24:35.58
How do you feel?

00:24:45.10,00:24:48.60
I'd say she was feeling better.[br]Splendid.

00:24:49.61,00:24:55.15
You could come by my shop tomorrow[br]afternoon and we can try again.

00:24:55.24,00:24:59.27
I shall need several hours[br]but the surroundings there will be...

00:24:59.37,00:25:03.53
You did great, she spoke,[br]but I don't have the money...

00:25:03.62,00:25:06.57
No. It will cost you nothing,[br]Mr Church.

00:25:06.67,00:25:09.41
We'll deal with her family[br]when we find them.

00:25:11.84,00:25:14.62
I'm sure they'll find my services[br]invaluable

00:25:14.72,00:25:19.42
once they realise I'm the one[br]who's reunited them with their...

00:25:19.52,00:25:22.05
daughter, wife, or whomever.

00:25:22.73,00:25:26.05
You have some lovely things. Pity...

00:25:28.86,00:25:30.89
I bid you all good day.

00:25:44.00,00:25:50.53
You missed something around the back.[br]Do you want to put your head down?

00:26:05.57,00:26:07.60
I'll get you a towel.

00:26:36.52,00:26:38.34
Madson?

00:26:39.56,00:26:43.72
You were inside[br]President Roosevelt's office?

00:26:44.82,00:26:48.31
Yes, lots of times.

00:26:49.53,00:26:52.10
My mommy was his cook.

00:26:52.20,00:26:54.98
We were like family.

00:26:56.70,00:27:00.36
I used to sit on Uncle Teddy's lap.

00:27:02.34,00:27:06.41
- I liked that.[br]- I'm sure Uncle Teddy did, too.

00:27:07.26,00:27:11.42
Mrs Tepper,[br]on the south wall of that office,

00:27:11.51,00:27:14.05
there was a lacquered mahogany desk.

00:27:14.14,00:27:17.59
Yes, I remember.

00:27:17.69,00:27:19.72
What did President...?

00:27:20.98,00:27:27.34
What did Uncle Teddy do with it?

00:27:29.20,00:27:36.78
He gave it to Emily Maxwell,[br]his personal secretary.

00:27:36.87,00:27:42.66
- Where did Mrs Maxwell retire to?[br]- Tucson, Arizona.

00:27:43.80,00:27:46.00
I'm going to count to three,

00:27:46.09,00:27:49.84
at which point you'll be wide awake,[br]quite refreshed,

00:27:50.93,00:27:54.30
and you'll remember nothing[br]of our little discussion.

00:27:54.39,00:27:56.96
One, two, three.

00:28:01.69,00:28:03.52
How did I do?

00:28:03.61,00:28:08.40
I don't think you'll need to worry[br]about those silly chocolate cravings.

00:28:24.01,00:28:27.21
Mother, turn that down, please.

00:28:32.77,00:28:39.64
I thought today,[br]since this is our first real session,

00:28:40.48,00:28:43.35
we'd just go for an hour or two.

00:28:47.83,00:28:51.60
As soon as you feel[br]quite comfortable, my dear,

00:28:52.75,00:28:57.74
I want you to take a look[br]at the candle in front of you.

00:28:59.96,00:29:03.50
I want you to stare at it. Good.

00:29:05.30,00:29:10.76
I want you to picture yourself[br]walking down a flight of stairs.

00:29:11.89,00:29:15.72
With each step,[br]you'll relax still further.

00:29:17.52,00:29:19.56
And as you go down,

00:29:19.65,00:29:22.05
I want you to tell yourself,

00:29:23.03,00:29:27.19
"I am going deeper and deeper

00:29:28.08,00:29:30.15
into a state of hypnosis."

00:29:32.08,00:29:35.41
Since yesterday[br]you became a bit excited,

00:29:35.50,00:29:40.54
today I want you to distance yourself[br]from the events you're watching,

00:29:40.63,00:29:46.25
as if you were only a witness,[br]not an actual participant.

00:29:50.64,00:29:54.47
If you do happen to notice[br]any nice little relics

00:29:54.57,00:29:58.81
or objets d'art along the way,[br]you might just mention them, too.

00:29:58.90,00:30:00.94
For Christ's sakes.

00:30:04.99,00:30:09.32
At the bottom of the stairs,[br]I want you to picture a door.

00:30:10.29,00:30:13.33
This door is very important,

00:30:13.42,00:30:18.04
because just beyond it lies[br]whatever time or place

00:30:18.13,00:30:20.92
from your life you wish to visit.

00:30:21.01,00:30:24.95
All right, the door has opened.

00:30:27.56,00:30:32.51
You can speak, my dear.[br]What was the happiest day...?

00:30:32.61,00:30:36.98
- The day we first met.[br]- Distance yourself.

00:30:42.83,00:30:47.78
The day Roman and Margaret first met.

00:30:48.33,00:30:50.20
Margaret?

00:30:50.29,00:30:52.33
- That's right.[br]- Margaret who?

00:30:52.42,00:30:56.00
- Mr Church...[br]- Strauss.

00:31:03.01,00:31:09.51
All right, let's go back to the day[br]Margaret and Roman first met.

00:31:11.19,00:31:14.68
How far back are you? Two years?

00:31:15.74,00:31:19.31
Three years? A year?

00:31:19.41,00:31:22.65
It was 1948.

00:31:24.41,00:31:26.65
I think I've heard enough.

00:31:26.75,00:31:30.91
Mr Church, I really must insist[br]that you refrain from talking.

00:31:31.00,00:31:34.62
The lady just told us she met a guy[br]named Roman in 1948.

00:31:34.72,00:31:38.75
- I say the session's over.[br]- On occasion, Mr Church,

00:31:38.85,00:31:43.80
hypnosis can take us back to our past[br]lives as well as our past.

00:31:43.89,00:31:45.93
You expect me just to run with that?

00:31:46.02,00:31:51.14
Let me remind you, yesterday[br]this young lady wasn't even speaking.

00:31:52.65,00:31:56.73
Rachmaninoff was[br]on the program that night.

00:31:59.41,00:32:01.44
Wait for me, my dear.

00:32:06.21,00:32:08.24
When was this?

00:32:12.51,00:32:16.83
Winter 1948.

00:32:19.39,00:32:24.59
Roman was guest conductor[br]with the Los Angeles Symphony.

00:32:27.15,00:32:29.77
Everyone was terrified of him,

00:32:30.57,00:32:33.02
except Margaret.

00:32:40.37,00:32:42.53
It was after the war,

00:32:43.67,00:32:48.33
and Los Angeles was so exciting.

00:32:50.59,00:32:54.92
Everywhere you went,[br]people were having fun.

00:33:00.77,00:33:02.80
I'm sorry.

00:33:03.40,00:33:05.79
To Margaret, a woman[br]with more beauty than grace.

00:33:05.90,00:33:07.72
Thank you very much.

00:33:07.82,00:33:09.81
Roman could dance.

00:33:10.99,00:33:13.23
He could tell jokes.

00:33:13.32,00:33:16.57
He could even read palms.

00:33:16.66,00:33:20.99
Not much of a life line, I'm afraid.

00:33:22.04,00:33:26.08
But wait. I do see love.

00:33:26.17,00:33:32.46
Passionate, everlasting, love.

00:33:33.35,00:33:37.01
- Does this work on a lot of women?[br]- I'll let you know.

00:33:40.35,00:33:43.47
Margaret's career was flourishing,

00:33:43.56,00:33:47.31
and Roman was confident[br]that his new opera

00:33:47.40,00:33:52.06
would make him as famous in America[br]as he had been in Europe.

00:33:58.37,00:34:00.45
I heard you were once married.

00:34:01.58,00:34:05.49
Yes, I was. She's dead now.

00:34:08.55,00:34:10.58
How did she die?

00:34:12.05,00:34:15.75
To escape Germany,[br]we had to go through the mountains.

00:34:15.85,00:34:22.89
It was a very difficult trip,[br]and she had a weak heart.

00:34:24.03,00:34:27.27
Roman lived in this enormous house.

00:34:27.99,00:34:31.44
Just him, his housekeeper[br]and her son.

00:34:32.03,00:34:34.07
And Roman's music.

00:34:35.04,00:34:39.16
It's for an opera I'm working on.

00:34:40.13,00:34:42.83
You're writing an opera[br]about a monster?

00:34:42.92,00:34:47.04
- Is this from your opera?[br]- Yes.

00:34:51.89,00:34:55.30
The opera was almost[br]all Roman cared about,

00:34:55.39,00:35:00.51
until he met Margaret and literally[br]swept her off her feet.

00:35:01.90,00:35:04.98
I'm drenched. We'll ruin this couch.

00:35:05.07,00:35:07.31
I'll get another one.

00:35:08.95,00:35:13.03
The day of the wedding was so happy.

00:35:13.12,00:35:18.95
It seemed like nothing and nobody[br]could ever come between them.

00:35:26.84,00:35:28.84
Daytime.

00:35:29.60,00:35:33.34
First step's always the toughest.[br]Sweetheart, thank you.

00:35:34.31,00:35:36.64
Help. Where are we?

00:35:36.73,00:35:39.47
Don't ask. Just try to be polite.

00:35:41.86,00:35:43.94
Easy, boys, the war is over.

00:35:44.03,00:35:45.94
- Lydia.[br]- Otto!

00:35:46.03,00:35:48.23
- So nice to see you.[br]- So nice to see you.

00:35:48.33,00:35:50.94
May I present Gray Baker?

00:35:53.00,00:35:56.91
- I'm yawning already.[br]- We'll stay five minutes.

00:35:57.00,00:36:00.29
- Nice to see you.[br]- Gray Baker. Congratulations.

00:36:37.59,00:36:39.87
Inga, I was just upstairs.

00:36:39.96,00:36:43.29
- Yes?[br]- It's just that I thought...

00:36:43.39,00:36:47.33
We had talked about you and Frankie[br]moving downstairs.

00:36:47.43,00:36:50.38
Roman never said anything to me.

00:36:51.64,00:36:54.80
What Mr Strauss said or didn't say[br]is irrelevant.

00:36:54.90,00:36:58.35
We've already discussed this.[br]Tonight, of all nights,

00:36:58.44,00:37:02.06
I'd appreciate it if you weren't[br]sleeping in the next room.

00:37:02.16,00:37:06.57
- Yes, Mrs Strauss.[br]- Thank you.

00:37:07.70,00:37:09.86
Mrs Strauss?

00:37:11.29,00:37:15.70
- Congratulations.[br]- Thank you, Frankie.

00:37:20.63,00:37:23.25
- Lydia.[br]- Mrs Strauss.

00:37:24.81,00:37:27.05
May I present Gray Baker?

00:37:27.14,00:37:29.47
- How do you do?[br]- How do you do?

00:37:29.56,00:37:32.85
Mr Bakerjust made the list[br]for the Pulitzer Prize.

00:37:32.94,00:37:34.72
Really?

00:37:34.82,00:37:37.52
- Yes, really.[br]- Well, congratulations.

00:37:37.61,00:37:40.81
- Congratulations yourself.[br]- Thank you.

00:37:42.99,00:37:45.15
So, any new tidbits from the press?

00:37:45.24,00:37:48.24
Zero. To tell you the truth,[br]I miss the war.

00:37:49.42,00:37:51.66
What an odd thing to say.

00:37:53.13,00:37:57.96
Doesn't seem to be much news any[br]more, all this back-to-normal stuff.

00:37:58.97,00:38:00.83
The world's getting boring again.

00:38:01.89,00:38:05.34
I'll tell you what,[br]the only thing I do regret

00:38:05.43,00:38:10.14
is by being away so long[br]I haven't had my chance...

00:38:12.52,00:38:16.56
to hear you play, Mrs Strauss.[br]To hear you play.

00:38:16.65,00:38:22.02
I'm not going into hiding, Mr Baker.[br]I'm just getting married.

00:38:22.12,00:38:25.11
- It's a pleasure to meet you.[br]- The pleasure's mine.

00:38:26.29,00:38:30.28
See you later. Bye.

00:38:32.25,00:38:36.58
Roman had given Margaret[br]the wedding day of her dreams,

00:38:37.13,00:38:40.50
full of new people[br]and wonderful surprises.

00:38:42.10,00:38:45.13
But there was[br]another surprise to come.

00:38:48.69,00:38:50.51
Roman.

00:38:56.24,00:38:58.72
I've never seen anything like this.

00:39:02.91,00:39:06.57
It's beautiful.[br]I don't know what to say.

00:39:07.92,00:39:11.95
- "Thank you" is always good.[br]- Thank you.

00:39:18.85,00:39:21.05
No, it's not a bracelet, darling.

00:39:21.14,00:39:25.13
It's an anklet,[br]a very special anklet.

00:39:25.23,00:39:27.26
Let's have your leg.

00:39:29.52,00:39:34.86
It's very old. The man[br]I bought it from explained to me

00:39:34.95,00:39:37.94
that when a husband gives this[br]to his wife,

00:39:39.74,00:39:41.24
they become...

00:39:42.33,00:39:46.02
two halves of the same person.

00:39:49.59,00:39:53.00
Nothing can separate them.

00:39:56.14,00:39:58.17
Not even death.

00:39:59.52,00:40:01.80
So we're stuck with each other.

00:40:01.89,00:40:05.89
Either that, or I've[br]overpaid terribly for the thing.

00:40:40.23,00:40:44.22
Three, two, one.

00:40:47.48,00:40:49.52
A little hot in here.

00:40:49.61,00:40:53.19
Mother, could you open[br]a window for us, please?

00:40:53.82,00:40:56.73
This isn't as uncommon[br]as you might think.

00:40:56.83,00:40:59.03
A colleague in San Francisco...

00:40:59.12,00:41:01.82
May I have a glass of water?

00:41:02.67,00:41:05.70
You really have found your tongue.[br]Wonderful.

00:41:05.80,00:41:08.19
- Do you know your name?[br]- Give her time.

00:41:08.30,00:41:11.46
Do you remember anything[br]about the people you talked about?

00:41:11.55,00:41:14.84
- Are they still alive?[br]- I'd like to show you something.

00:41:20.73,00:41:23.10
June 1949.

00:41:30.03,00:41:33.86
That was Roman Strauss,[br]that was his wife Margaret,

00:41:33.95,00:41:36.43
and that was their home.

00:41:39.33,00:41:43.74
Handsome man, wasn't he? Not at all[br]the sort who'd murder his wife.

00:41:45.42,00:41:49.33
Yes. He stabbed her in the throat

00:41:49.43,00:41:53.71
with a lovely pair of antique[br]Die Schere barber scissors.

00:41:53.81,00:41:56.51
Die Schere... Disher.

00:41:56.60,00:42:00.64
They were auctioned at Christie's[br]last year for 20,000

00:42:01.65,00:42:04.18
by a Japanese gentleman,[br]if memory serves.

00:42:07.24,00:42:09.27
They seemed so in love.

00:42:09.37,00:42:12.57
They're usually the people[br]that kill each other.

00:42:12.66,00:42:15.95
Could she have dreamed this[br]or read about them?

00:42:16.04,00:42:20.53
No. I got clarity far beyond what one[br]would pick up from reading.

00:42:20.88,00:42:23.87
- They look alike. It means nothing.[br]- Mr Church.

00:42:23.96,00:42:28.25
- I don't believe she was there.[br]- It doesn't matter.

00:42:28.34,00:42:31.96
For whatever reason,[br]these events are consuming her.

00:42:32.06,00:42:36.59
The sooner we work through them, the[br]sooner she'll get her memory back.

00:42:36.69,00:42:41.10
Tomorrow I have a Friar's luncheon[br]at twelve.

00:42:41.19,00:42:45.81
- How's 4:00 tomorrow sound?[br]- Yes. Thank you very much.

00:42:45.91,00:42:48.36
My pleasure.

00:42:51.54,00:42:53.36
- Mr Church.[br]- Yeah?

00:42:53.46,00:42:57.45
The magazine. It's $17.95.

00:43:06.09,00:43:09.95
You OK? ls there anything[br]you need right now?

00:43:10.06,00:43:12.09
You mean besides my memory?

00:43:13.89,00:43:17.59
OK. I can't get used[br]to the sound of your voice.

00:43:17.69,00:43:21.60
It's like one day you wake up[br]and your cat talks to you.

00:43:21.69,00:43:26.19
It's just you've been so quiet[br]the last couple of days and...

00:43:26.28,00:43:29.82
Never mind.[br]I didn't speak. Forget it.

00:43:31.33,00:43:33.36
Mr Church.

00:43:34.12,00:43:36.79
- Mike.[br]- Why are you helping me?

00:43:36.88,00:43:38.91
I don't know. You smell good.

00:43:39.00,00:43:42.12
Maybe I feel sorry for you.[br]Maybe I like you.

00:43:42.22,00:43:45.67
Maybe I just want to hear[br]how that story you told ends.

00:43:45.76,00:43:48.71
But you don't believe any of that.

00:43:48.81,00:43:51.59
I believe you experienced[br]something weird.

00:43:51.69,00:43:54.30
I'm not convinced it means[br]what he says.

00:43:56.32,00:44:00.17
- You think I'm crazy?[br]- I think we need a second opinion.

00:44:03.78,00:44:06.86
- What do you think happened?[br]- Sounds like a past-life experience.

00:44:06.95,00:44:08.78
You said you were good.

00:44:08.87,00:44:11.91
I used to think it was bullshit,[br]but it happens.

00:44:12.00,00:44:14.78
I had this one crazy old lady.[br]Really batshit.

00:44:14.88,00:44:18.65
She was so claustrophobic[br]she'd choke in Yankee Stadium.

00:44:18.76,00:44:22.96
I thought, you know[br]what I'm dealing with here?

00:44:23.05,00:44:26.80
Maybe some childhood trauma.[br]I'll use hypnotherapy.

00:44:26.89,00:44:29.67
I'll find some memory.[br]I'll regress her.

00:44:29.77,00:44:32.25
Sure enough. Bingo!

00:44:32.35,00:44:34.81
There it was.[br]She was five years old.

00:44:34.90,00:44:38.39
She had this uncle who'd molest her[br]in the closet.

00:44:38.49,00:44:42.40
Really sick shit.[br]I thought, "I got it!" No.

00:44:42.49,00:44:45.65
A couple more months,[br]she's still claustrophobic.

00:44:45.74,00:44:49.44
I said, what the fuck![br]I'll regress her back even further.

00:44:49.54,00:44:51.57
This time when I ask her the year,

00:44:51.67,00:44:54.53
- she says 1832.[br]- 1832?

00:44:54.63,00:44:57.71
When I hear that,[br]I say, "Right, lady. Blow me."

00:44:57.80,00:45:02.34
But she keeps going. She says there's[br]this father who's an undertaker.

00:45:02.43,00:45:05.71
She has a brother[br]who liked to lock her in coffins.

00:45:05.81,00:45:09.47
I don't know if it was bullshit[br]or if it wasn't.

00:45:09.56,00:45:15.02
All I know is after that session,[br]she wasn't claustrophobic any more.

00:45:18.15,00:45:21.52
A lot more people believe in[br]past lives than don't.

00:45:21.62,00:45:24.18
I'm sure that makes her[br]feel a lot better.

00:45:24.29,00:45:29.07
This lady screams in her sleep today,[br]right now. I don't care who she was.

00:45:29.17,00:45:31.65
I want to know who she is.

00:45:34.21,00:45:37.04
Do you believe what you saw was real?

00:45:37.13,00:45:40.54
It seemed real. Yeah.

00:45:40.64,00:45:43.20
Stick with the junk man.[br]He's on the right track.

00:45:43.31,00:45:45.55
- I'll tell you why.[br]- Look...

00:45:46.64,00:45:49.09
Sometimes a trauma in a present life

00:45:49.19,00:45:52.18
can lead you back[br]to a trauma in a past life.

00:45:52.27,00:45:54.64
If you resolve that past-life trauma,

00:45:54.74,00:45:57.73
you got a good chance[br]of finding out who you are.

00:45:57.82,00:46:02.19
You take knowledge from this life,[br]use it in the next. That's karma.

00:46:02.29,00:46:05.61
Isn't it I do something bad now,[br]I'm a termite next time?

00:46:05.71,00:46:11.05
You ask me, you're already a termite[br]in this life in a shitty suit, OK?

00:46:11.13,00:46:15.46
What good is learning if you'll be[br]with different people each time?

00:46:15.55,00:46:18.12
You won't be with different people.

00:46:18.22,00:46:21.59
Thanks to fate, the cosmic force[br]with a tragic sense of humour,

00:46:21.68,00:46:26.09
you burn somebody in one life,[br]they get to burn you in this one.

00:46:26.19,00:46:30.72
It's the karma credit plan.[br]Buy now, pay forever.

00:46:34.07,00:46:37.44
Excuse me. It's my karmic burden[br]to load some cat food.

00:46:39.74,00:46:41.69
Come on.

00:46:51.05,00:46:53.41
Tell me something, Mike.

00:46:54.22,00:46:57.54
Why is it that I can recognise[br]certain smells,

00:46:57.64,00:47:00.80
that I know my right hand[br]from my left,

00:47:00.89,00:47:03.93
but I can't remember[br]what my favourite colour is

00:47:04.02,00:47:09.36
or my favourite flower[br]or what kind of wine I like.

00:47:09.94,00:47:12.06
- Maybe you're lucky.[br]- How so?

00:47:12.15,00:47:16.73
There must be a certain freedom[br]living only in the present.

00:47:16.83,00:47:21.28
At least you don't have to spend[br]every day trying to forget your past.

00:47:23.54,00:47:25.57
Excuse me.

00:47:33.09,00:47:35.57
So Roman's guard on death row[br]wrote this?

00:47:35.68,00:47:37.75
This is the press coverage?

00:47:37.85,00:47:41.54
I spent three hours in the file[br]morgue looking for that stuff.

00:47:41.64,00:47:45.34
How's it going with Jane Doe?[br]Getting anywhere? Trying to?

00:47:45.44,00:47:47.77
Gray Baker.[br]She mentioned him today.

00:47:47.86,00:47:51.89
- You think she's married?[br]- He wrote every single one of these?

00:47:51.99,00:47:55.36
- I've known her two days.[br]- Sometimes that's all it takes.

00:47:55.45,00:47:58.94
- Think Baker's still around?[br]- He'd be a million years old.

00:47:59.04,00:48:01.44
I notice you're staying in tonight.

00:48:01.54,00:48:06.29
Why don't you find someone from that[br]paper who knows what happened to him.

00:48:08.63,00:48:10.67
Shut up.

00:48:11.18,00:48:14.63
- Hello, Pete.[br]- You're talking!

00:48:16.18,00:48:19.96
Yeah. I hope it's OK,[br]I borrowed more clothes.

00:48:20.27,00:48:22.09
Sure, fine.

00:48:23.82,00:48:26.97
Don't worry.[br]I didn't mess with your stuff.

00:48:29.61,00:48:31.60
I like your voice.

00:48:32.66,00:48:35.22
I like being able to finally use it.

00:48:35.33,00:48:37.36
You don't want to be late.

00:48:37.45,00:48:39.49
- For what?[br]- For whatever.

00:48:40.25,00:48:43.70
- Right. She's living here?[br]- Let me know when you find Baker.

00:48:43.80,00:48:46.04
Need some? I got one in my wallet.

00:48:49.76,00:48:52.84
It was really nice of you[br]to eat the whole dinner.

00:48:52.93,00:48:56.92
- No. It was really good.[br]- I don't have company that often.

00:48:57.02,00:49:01.18
You'll love this. We can have[br]a few drinks, maybe dance off dinner.

00:49:01.27,00:49:04.18
I know the owner.[br]He'll take good care of us.

00:49:06.28,00:49:08.31
Ray, how you doing?

00:49:09.82,00:49:12.52
We're closed, Mike.[br]It's going to rain.

00:49:12.62,00:49:15.78
- You're kidding. No music tonight?[br]- Al's sick.

00:49:17.50,00:49:20.37
I'm trying to have[br]a romantic evening.

00:49:20.46,00:49:22.70
You want to get her drunk?

00:49:24.67,00:49:27.58
Two glasses of wine.[br]We'll sit outside. You can leave.

00:49:27.68,00:49:29.83
- We lost our liquor licence.[br]- No.

00:49:29.93,00:49:33.62
- The neighbours.[br]- How about some coffee?

00:49:33.72,00:49:35.84
I got tea.

00:49:35.94,00:49:39.09
- Tea is fine.[br]- Tea is fine.

00:49:39.19,00:49:42.10
What the hell[br]happened to this place?

00:49:42.19,00:49:45.44
I can't believe there's no booze.[br]What's going on?

00:50:03.80,00:50:06.20
Is this from your opera?

00:50:30.91,00:50:35.41
Father Tim made us take piano[br]lessons. He said it was therapeutic.

00:50:41.67,00:50:44.67
Tea's up. Jesus! I'm sorry.

00:50:44.76,00:50:48.25
Let's see how else[br]I can screw up this evening.

00:50:48.35,00:50:50.38
- It's OK.[br]- You OK?

00:50:50.47,00:50:52.80
It's OK.

00:50:56.90,00:50:59.22
- It's OK.[br]- OK.

00:51:04.66,00:51:08.98
- Cold?[br]- No, I'm not cold.

00:51:09.62,00:51:11.65
I'm just scared.

00:51:12.67,00:51:15.83
- Of what?[br]- I don't know.

00:51:19.13,00:51:21.46
It's like...

00:51:21.55,00:51:24.71
someone's following me.

00:51:25.89,00:51:29.51
And I can't see who it is.

00:51:29.60,00:51:30.93
I can't...

00:51:34.11,00:51:36.26
see behind me.

00:51:36.36,00:51:40.10
But you will. It takes time.

00:51:40.20,00:51:42.27
Mike, someone wants to kill me.

00:51:42.36,00:51:46.22
Those are just dreams.[br]They're not real.

00:51:46.33,00:51:49.24
Nobody is going to hurt you now.

00:51:50.42,00:51:54.66
When you know who you are,[br]you're not going to be so afraid.

00:51:57.38,00:52:02.58
If it makes you feel any better,[br]I can read tea bags.

00:52:02.68,00:52:08.09
- You're gonna tell me my future?[br]- I'm going to tell you your past.

00:52:12.52,00:52:17.64
Let's see. You were born in ldaho.[br]Your father was a potato farmer.

00:52:17.74,00:52:21.06
You tell jokes real well.[br]You're a great cook.

00:52:21.16,00:52:25.36
You never get seasick, except maybe[br]that one time on your honeymoon.

00:52:25.45,00:52:27.28
I'm married?

00:52:27.37,00:52:29.70
To Jim Tannenbaum, the Potato Prince.

00:52:29.79,00:52:32.91
The Potato Prince? So I'm rich?

00:52:33.00,00:52:35.83
No, but you have each other,[br]so it doesn't matter.

00:52:35.92,00:52:39.17
Your favourite colour's red.[br]Favourite flowers are roses.

00:52:39.26,00:52:41.29
How did I lose my memory?

00:52:41.39,00:52:44.76
Once a month, you take[br]six homeless women bungee jumping

00:52:44.85,00:52:47.63
off the Cal Fed building[br]on Miracle Mile.

00:52:47.73,00:52:53.22
Last week, you bumped your head and[br]wandered around the Wilshire district

00:52:53.32,00:52:55.39
until you ended up at St Audrey's.

00:52:55.49,00:52:58.56
- Bungee jumping?[br]- You're a thrill seeker.

00:52:58.66,00:53:00.69
What's my name?

00:53:04.62,00:53:06.45
Grace.

00:53:08.17,00:53:10.12
Grace.

00:53:10.96,00:53:14.12
That's what the tea bag says,[br]that my name is Grace.

00:53:14.21,00:53:17.67
I had this kindergarten teacher,[br]Sister Grace.

00:53:17.76,00:53:20.29
You remind me of her.

00:53:21.10,00:53:23.80
Would this be the[br]big, fat sister Grace?

00:53:23.89,00:53:27.18
No, this would be the

00:53:27.27,00:53:33.02
big, beautiful, Sister Grace.

00:53:37.53,00:53:41.94
OK. Grace it is.

00:53:42.04,00:53:44.74
OK. To Grace.

00:53:50.96,00:53:55.58
Mike, why is it[br]Father Timothy asked you to help me?

00:53:55.68,00:53:59.42
I owe Tim a lot of favours.[br]I was not the greatest kid.

00:53:59.51,00:54:02.67
I always had this kind of temper.

00:54:02.77,00:54:06.63
I used to beat up on the other kids.[br]He straightened me out.

00:54:06.73,00:54:12.31
In fact, if it wasn't for him,[br]I'd be in some jail somewhere.

00:54:12.40,00:54:16.77
Don't you think it's strange we both[br]just showed up at St Audrey's?

00:54:16.87,00:54:20.81
Not strange. Just one of those[br]things. It's coincidence.

00:54:24.46,00:54:26.49
I wonder.

00:54:27.21,00:54:29.45
You wonder what?

00:54:32.97,00:54:36.04
I wonder how[br]the Potato Prince would feel

00:54:36.14,00:54:39.38
about us walking together[br]around a moonlit lake.

00:54:39.47,00:54:42.63
I'm sure he's a very[br]understanding guy.

00:54:44.44,00:54:47.43
Then again,[br]maybe there is no Potato Prince.

00:54:47.52,00:54:49.56
Maybe not.

00:54:51.90,00:54:54.61
- It's sprinkling.[br]- That's nothing.

00:54:54.70,00:54:57.82
- Do you remember how to dance?[br]- I don't know.

00:54:57.91,00:55:00.86
- Let's go up to my roof and see.[br]- Your roof?

00:55:00.96,00:55:04.57
It's where I take all the women[br]I date with no memory.

00:55:04.67,00:55:08.04
- It's going to rain.[br]- It never rains in LA.

00:55:08.71,00:55:10.75
I think it is going to rain.

00:55:35.41,00:55:37.74
- We'll ruin it.[br]- It's already ruined.

00:55:37.83,00:55:40.39
This is what happened[br]with Roman and Margaret.

00:55:40.50,00:55:42.53
I'm not Roman.

00:56:04.27,00:56:06.10
We can always go back inside.

00:56:07.86,00:56:11.72
No, I'm hungry.[br]Let's go someplace, see what I like.

00:56:11.82,00:56:14.44
Maybe Syd would give you[br]your old table back.

00:56:14.54,00:56:16.40
Kathryn?

00:56:19.62,00:56:21.91
Kathryn!

00:56:22.00,00:56:24.33
Thank God, you're all right.

00:56:25.51,00:56:27.79
- You don't recognise me, do you?[br]- No.

00:56:27.88,00:56:30.08
In a few days, it'll all come back.

00:56:30.18,00:56:33.71
- Who the hell are you?[br]- I'm sorry. Doug O'Malley.

00:56:33.81,00:56:35.92
- So?[br]- This is my fiancée.

00:56:38.85,00:56:41.97
When I got home and[br]you weren't there, I went crazy.

00:56:42.07,00:56:44.43
Then I saw your picture in the paper.

00:56:44.53,00:56:48.65
- Why doesn't she recognise you?[br]- It must be the Dalmane.

00:56:48.74,00:56:53.15
- The what?[br]- Dalmane. It's for insomnia.

00:56:53.24,00:56:56.61
- "Kathryn Pierce"?[br]- Sometimes it causes memory lapse.

00:56:58.79,00:57:01.36
- Are those his?[br]- This has happened before?

00:57:01.46,00:57:05.29
Once when she took too much,[br]but I was around that time.

00:57:05.38,00:57:08.71
- Whose clothes are these?[br]- Where were you this time?

00:57:08.80,00:57:12.96
- I had a job interview back east.[br]- What kind of ring does she wear?

00:57:17.15,00:57:21.56
It's an lrish wedding band.[br]I gave it to her in high school.

00:57:22.49,00:57:25.85
I'm still going to need[br]a little more.

00:57:25.95,00:57:30.07
I found this near the front door.[br]You must have dropped it.

00:57:34.29,00:57:38.37
- Why can't I remember you?[br]- You will. I swear you will.

00:57:44.51,00:57:46.33
I promise.

00:57:50.35,00:57:53.13
Is there some sort of fee[br]involved here?

00:57:53.23,00:57:55.26
Forget it.

00:57:57.15,00:57:59.68
You should get something[br]for your trouble.

00:57:59.78,00:58:03.52
- Let me pay for your expenses.[br]- Just...

00:58:07.45,00:58:09.65
Just take good care of her.

00:58:09.74,00:58:12.49
I don't know what...

00:58:15.71,00:58:18.04
Thank you for everything, Mr Church.

00:58:23.30,00:58:25.33
Have a nice life.

00:58:35.52,00:58:38.31
The car's up here.[br]We'll go straight to the doctor.

00:58:38.40,00:58:40.43
I got your other glove.

00:58:45.24,00:58:48.93
Man, you were this close.

00:58:49.04,00:58:51.86
This glove thing was a nice touch.

00:58:51.96,00:58:54.03
I don't know what you mean.

00:58:54.13,00:58:57.49
There's only one[br]teeny little problem.

00:58:58.09,00:59:01.92
It's for the wrong hand, Doug.

00:59:14.77,00:59:16.81
Son of a bitch!

00:59:50.86,00:59:52.89
You son of a...

01:00:03.29,01:00:06.44
That fucking guy[br]look like he knew karate to you?

01:00:06.54,01:00:08.41
I really believed him. Who was he?

01:00:08.50,01:00:10.53
You got people chasing you[br]in every life.

01:00:10.63,01:00:12.91
The sooner we find out[br]who you are, the better.

01:00:15.55,01:00:18.00
In light of today's events,

01:00:19.05,01:00:22.21
I think we should[br]move along a little faster.

01:00:22.31,01:00:26.38
Therefore, my dear,[br]I want you to think about

01:00:26.48,01:00:32.39
when things started to turn sour[br]for Roman and Margaret.

01:00:32.48,01:00:36.89
All right, then? The door has opened.

01:00:39.07,01:00:43.90
It all started[br]the night of Otto Kline's party.

01:00:51.75,01:00:56.62
It was one of Otto's[br]weird costume things.

01:00:56.72,01:00:59.00
Roman didn't want to go.

01:00:59.10,01:01:02.42
Margaret was convinced[br]that something was wrong,

01:01:03.18,01:01:07.51
but Roman would only say[br]that things were wonderful.

01:01:07.61,01:01:12.10
Welcome, my dear friends.[br]Let the party begin!

01:01:20.91,01:01:23.74
Margaret, darling! Margaret, hello!

01:01:23.83,01:01:27.95
- You look so lovely.[br]- You look stunning, beautiful.

01:01:28.04,01:01:31.70
Strauss, you old Kraut.[br]There you are.

01:01:31.80,01:01:34.62
- How are you?[br]- Excuse me.

01:01:34.72,01:01:37.46
Of course, I love what you do.

01:01:39.26,01:01:43.09
- Otto, I love your costume![br]- What luck I have.

01:01:43.19,01:01:47.76
- May I have a word in private?[br]- Sure. What's on your mind?

01:01:47.86,01:01:50.47
- I need some money.[br]- You?

01:01:58.33,01:02:02.57
- I'm offering you a job.[br]- I can't write music for the movies.

01:02:02.67,01:02:06.16
I tried it once. You yourself said[br]it wasn't any good.

01:02:06.25,01:02:09.79
No. I told you it was too good[br]for the damn picture.

01:02:09.88,01:02:13.63
It doesn't matter. I've turned[br]the library into a music room.

01:02:13.72,01:02:16.96
If I can just finish this opera,[br]I know things will change.

01:02:17.06,01:02:20.17
- There you are, you naughty boy.[br]- Darling!

01:02:24.40,01:02:28.17
- Mission dry, please.[br]- What a coincidence.

01:02:29.11,01:02:30.60
Mr Baker.

01:02:30.70,01:02:33.48
- Mrs Strauss.[br]- How are you?

01:02:33.57,01:02:36.78
- Still miss the war?[br]- Matter of fact, I do.

01:02:38.66,01:02:41.66
- Thank you.[br]- To friendship.

01:02:43.04,01:02:45.95
- Cheers.[br]- Cheers.

01:02:49.13,01:02:52.17
- Is it really good to smoke so much?[br]- No.

01:02:54.35,01:02:58.42
That's why I started rolling my own.[br]Figured it will slow me down.

01:02:58.52,01:03:02.43
- Has it?[br]- No. I just roll them faster.

01:03:17.20,01:03:19.91
- You look like you're somebody.[br]- Do l?

01:03:20.00,01:03:22.28
- You in the business?[br]- The business?

01:03:22.38,01:03:25.79
- You know, pictures, movies.[br]- No. I'm a composer.

01:03:25.88,01:03:28.58
In that case, you're not anybody.

01:03:34.10,01:03:37.51
It's cold.[br]I think we should go inside.

01:03:39.56,01:03:42.18
How are things at home, Margaret?

01:03:42.27,01:03:44.56
Writing gossip these days, Mr Baker?

01:03:44.65,01:03:47.98
You meet someone on their[br]wedding day, it's been a while,

01:03:48.07,01:03:50.86
it's natural to inquire[br]how things are going.

01:03:50.95,01:03:54.11
- Especially if you're a reporter.[br]- Especially.

01:03:54.20,01:03:57.28
- How are things?[br]- Fine. Wonderful.

01:03:57.37,01:04:00.58
- Go inside, everyone.[br]- This cutting cold!

01:04:00.67,01:04:04.29
Make yourself comfortable.[br]Roman, it's freezing out there.

01:04:12.18,01:04:16.97
- I could be a good friend, Margaret.[br]- What makes you such a good friend?

01:04:17.56,01:04:20.60
I can talk baseball to a man

01:04:20.69,01:04:24.85
and pay a stupid compliment[br]to a woman, what else is there?

01:04:25.78,01:04:28.48
Who's going to win[br]the series this year?

01:04:29.33,01:04:31.15
Very nice.

01:04:33.41,01:04:35.86
Impressive piece ofjewellery.

01:04:38.92,01:04:42.75
May I get close to it?

01:04:43.97,01:04:45.50
Yes.

01:04:51.27,01:04:53.66
This must be worth a fortune.

01:04:55.48,01:04:57.51
Yes, it is.

01:05:01.49,01:05:06.40
I know I shouldn't say this,[br]but the first time I saw you...

01:05:08.08,01:05:12.02
- Hello, Margaret.[br]- Roman. Where have you been?

01:05:12.12,01:05:14.66
Inside with everyone else.

01:05:17.09,01:05:18.91
How are you, Mr Strauss?

01:05:19.00,01:05:21.87
I'm curious what you were[br]doing with my wife's leg.

01:05:21.97,01:05:24.25
- I was only trying...[br]- Really, Roman.

01:05:24.34,01:05:28.84
- Mr Baker's just a friend.[br]- This man is no friend of yours.

01:05:28.93,01:05:32.97
This is none of my business[br]but Margaret just needed somebody...

01:05:34.02,01:05:35.93
Roman!

01:05:42.15,01:05:44.98
- Where do you get such ideas?[br]- I don't know.

01:05:45.07,01:05:47.52
Maybe when I saw him[br]holding your leg.

01:05:47.62,01:05:52.03
He was looking at the anklet[br]you specifically asked me to wear

01:05:52.12,01:05:55.37
so everybody could see[br]how rich we are, or were.

01:05:55.46,01:05:58.83
- So you told him we're broke?[br]- I didn't say anything.

01:05:58.92,01:06:00.83
No, you just lifted up your dress!

01:06:00.92,01:06:03.13
Is everything all right,[br]Mr Strauss?

01:06:03.93,01:06:07.55
Yes. Everything is fine.

01:06:13.23,01:06:15.85
I may not be[br]as successful as Gray Baker...

01:06:15.94,01:06:21.52
I don't care about Gray Baker![br]You can be so stupid sometimes.

01:06:30.92,01:06:36.62
What happened to the man who said[br]that nothing could separate us.

01:06:38.63,01:06:41.54
That we're two halves[br]of the same person?

01:06:42.39,01:06:45.50
He became a nobody.

01:06:59.78,01:07:02.18
Only in his eyes.

01:07:06.12,01:07:08.49
You're not a nobody, Roman.

01:07:12.84,01:07:14.87
And you're my husband.

01:07:18.13,01:07:20.17
I love you.

01:07:34.61,01:07:36.44
No, no...

01:07:37.66,01:07:40.65
- No![br]- Mr Strauss?

01:07:43.79,01:07:48.41
- Yes, Frankie?[br]- The phone rang. Mother answered.

01:07:48.50,01:07:53.50
I'm not sure,[br]but I think it's for you.

01:07:56.59,01:07:58.71
Thank you, Frankie.

01:08:06.19,01:08:09.39
I called to apologise[br]about the other night.

01:08:09.48,01:08:14.02
Not at all. I'm hoping[br]that we can all forget what happened.

01:08:14.11,01:08:19.45
Margaret, I think there's some things[br]you should know about Roman's money.

01:08:23.04,01:08:27.66
- Who was on the phone earlier?[br]- Just an old friend.

01:08:29.00,01:08:31.04
The flute player.

01:08:33.67,01:08:35.50
Oboe.

01:08:39.72,01:08:41.76
How is he?

01:08:48.11,01:08:50.14
She's fine.

01:08:59.87,01:09:01.69
Good.

01:09:12.88,01:09:14.92
What are you doing?

01:09:17.85,01:09:20.13
I was giving you this.

01:09:20.23,01:09:23.51
It's a charm for good luck.

01:09:23.60,01:09:28.10
Frankie, do you know what happened[br]to my pearl earrings?

01:09:28.19,01:09:31.27
No, I don't.

01:09:31.36,01:09:33.44
They were in this drawer last night.

01:09:33.53,01:09:38.15
I wouldn't steal anything from you,[br]Mrs Strauss.

01:09:38.24,01:09:44.32
I don't have to.[br]Roman is very good to us.

01:10:06.40,01:10:08.23
You're overreacting.

01:10:08.32,01:10:10.60
I caught him[br]with his hand in my drawer.

01:10:10.70,01:10:15.15
He was giving you a charm.[br]They're like that, superstitious.

01:10:15.24,01:10:19.57
- I want you to fire them.[br]- I can't fire them.

01:10:19.67,01:10:22.57
- They've been with me for years.[br]- That's no reason...

01:10:22.67,01:10:25.62
- They saved my life.[br]- What are you talking about?

01:10:25.71,01:10:28.16
They got me out of Germany.

01:10:28.26,01:10:32.59
After my wife died, I became ill.

01:10:32.68,01:10:36.92
Frankie and lnga risked their[br]own lives by remaining with me.

01:10:37.02,01:10:41.18
They made many sacrifices. They...

01:10:42.23,01:10:45.77
You can't ask me to[br]fire these people, Margaret.

01:10:45.86,01:10:50.19
Why have you never told me you got[br]all your money from your first wife?

01:10:51.12,01:10:53.07
Because it isn't true. Who...?

01:10:53.16,01:10:56.65
Why would a woman with a bad heart[br]travel over mountains?

01:10:56.75,01:11:00.99
We had no choice. It would have[br]been worse had we stayed.

01:11:03.50,01:11:07.92
Have I answered all[br]of Mr Baker's questions?

01:11:09.76,01:11:12.50
He's been feeding you[br]this nonsense, hasn't he?

01:11:12.60,01:11:15.80
What is it between you and Mr Baker?

01:11:15.89,01:11:19.30
- Roman, don't start this.[br]- Where do you two meet?

01:11:19.40,01:11:21.51
Don't you walk away from me!

01:11:25.86,01:11:27.94
Wake up, sweetheart.

01:11:29.07,01:11:33.15
- Roman?[br]- No. These are for you.

01:11:39.92,01:11:45.04
- You were in the house.[br]- What house?

01:11:45.76,01:11:49.13
Roman and Margaret's house.

01:11:49.22,01:11:52.17
You saw Mr Church in the past?

01:11:52.27,01:11:54.94
He had a pair of scissors.

01:11:57.19,01:11:59.39
He was going to kill me.

01:11:59.48,01:12:03.81
- Come on.[br]- This means that you're finally...

01:12:03.90,01:12:06.15
coming into the present.

01:12:06.24,01:12:12.32
- I'm on her mind, that's all.[br]- You were there.

01:12:12.41,01:12:16.87
We could always regress you, Mr[br]Church, take you back 40 years.

01:12:17.59,01:12:19.91
- Forget it.[br]- Well, why not?

01:12:20.00,01:12:23.95
That way, if you walk through[br]the door and out onto Miami Beach,

01:12:24.05,01:12:27.04
- at least we'd know for certain.[br]- I'm not Roman.

01:12:27.97,01:12:30.00
But you were there.

01:12:31.60,01:12:33.63
It was real.

01:12:57.59,01:13:00.50
Yes. I'm coming. Yeah?

01:13:00.59,01:13:02.58
- Mike, this is Pete.[br]- Yeah?

01:13:02.68,01:13:06.17
- I got a line on Gray Baker.[br]- So he's still alive?

01:13:06.26,01:13:09.71
I got a post office box[br]in the Valley.

01:13:09.81,01:13:13.93
- I want to send him a message.[br]- Hold on. Go ahead.

01:13:14.02,01:13:18.02
You have it say, "Margaret wants[br]to know if you still miss the war."

01:13:18.11,01:13:20.48
- What?[br]- No name. Just my number.

01:13:21.86,01:13:24.77
Maybe Gray Baker[br]can make sense out of this.

01:13:24.87,01:13:28.78
- I'm afraid of you, Mike.[br]- You're afraid of a dead man.

01:13:29.87,01:13:32.35
You heard what Dr Carlisle said,

01:13:32.46,01:13:35.49
about how two people[br]keep meeting again and again.

01:13:35.59,01:13:39.00
Say that's true.[br]Why would I hurt you?

01:13:39.09,01:13:42.38
- Why would Roman hurt Margaret?[br]- I'm not Roman!

01:13:42.47,01:13:44.50
Trudy! Will you shut up?

01:13:45.14,01:13:47.59
OK, take these.

01:13:48.77,01:13:50.97
- Take them![br]- Well, I don't want them.

01:13:51.06,01:13:54.22
I want you to have them,[br]so just take them.

01:13:54.32,01:13:56.52
OK, all right.

01:13:57.65,01:14:01.19
- Will you stop...[br]- Take the fucking scissors, Grace!

01:14:01.28,01:14:05.40
Come on. I got some more.[br]Come on! Let's clear this thing up.

01:14:07.96,01:14:11.12
- Mike, don't![br]- We can't be too careful.

01:14:11.21,01:14:13.88
I might scratch your eyes out[br]with them.

01:14:13.96,01:14:17.50
I know we got some more.[br]There's got to be some in here.

01:14:17.59,01:14:20.50
Mike, please stop it! Stop it!

01:14:20.59,01:14:23.92
Here, take it. Sleep with it.[br]Put it under your pillow.

01:14:24.01,01:14:27.13
- I come near you, blow my head off.[br]- No!

01:14:27.23,01:14:32.05
If you're so fucking afraid of me,[br]you should be glad to have it!

01:14:32.94,01:14:34.77
No!

01:14:47.46,01:14:51.45
I'm sorry. It's OK.

01:14:53.21,01:14:55.25
I would never hurt you, Margaret.

01:15:03.06,01:15:04.88
All right.

01:15:07.31,01:15:09.47
Let us begin with the staircase.

01:15:11.07,01:15:15.81
As you continue down, you become[br]aware of a door at the bottom.

01:15:16.74,01:15:18.77
As you move through this door,

01:15:18.87,01:15:21.86
you will recall a memory,[br]any memory at all.

01:15:22.87,01:15:26.86
Just tell me the first thing you see[br]as you go through the door.

01:15:26.96,01:15:30.53
Remember,[br]you are no longer an observer.

01:15:30.63,01:15:32.45
Where are you?

01:15:32.55,01:15:35.62
- In a hallway.[br]- Whose hallway?

01:15:35.72,01:15:38.67
- My hallway.[br]- Who are you?

01:15:38.76,01:15:42.97
- I don't know.[br]- Have a look at yourself.

01:15:43.89,01:15:45.80
What do you see?

01:15:45.90,01:15:48.51
My leg? I don't know.

01:15:49.48,01:15:51.60
I see a candlestick.

01:15:52.74,01:15:57.40
I'm going through a door.[br]It's a bedroom, it's my bedroom.

01:15:58.70,01:16:01.86
I see pictures[br]on the walls, a chair...

01:16:01.95,01:16:05.20
I don't know,[br]there's this dressing table.

01:16:07.04,01:16:10.24
Mr Church, what else do you see?

01:16:10.84,01:16:13.79
The chair. I see a mirror.

01:16:13.88,01:16:18.63
- And in the mirror?[br]- I see myself.

01:16:18.72,01:16:21.80
Do you know your name?

01:16:21.89,01:16:24.01
Yes.

01:16:24.10,01:16:26.14
- Well, what is it?[br]- Strauss.

01:16:31.28,01:16:35.31
What do you see, Mr Church?[br]What do you see?

01:16:36.20,01:16:38.73
Stop this. Jealous... Have to...

01:16:40.12,01:16:41.95
Have to stop this.

01:16:42.04,01:16:45.53
I have to stop this.[br]I have to stop this.

01:16:48.00,01:16:51.75
No, Mr Baker.[br]There's nothing to say. Goodbye.

01:17:02.65,01:17:04.68
I think we've heard enough.

01:17:04.77,01:17:09.56
No, you haven't.[br]I'm not Roman, and you were not...

01:17:09.65,01:17:11.48
Hello!

01:17:11.57,01:17:13.73
Mike, I was hoping you'd be here.

01:17:13.82,01:17:16.07
Hi, Amanda.

01:17:17.37,01:17:21.45
- Who?[br]- That's your name, Amanda Sharp.

01:17:21.54,01:17:24.74
Your ID's inside.[br]Apparently, you're an artist.

01:17:24.84,01:17:29.08
You live on High Tower, the old[br]Carl Kay house, with the elevator?

01:17:29.17,01:17:31.21
Your neighbour saw the picture.

01:17:31.30,01:17:34.59
When they couldn't[br]reach Mike, they called the paper.

01:17:34.68,01:17:36.59
No!

01:17:40.40,01:17:42.60
I got to get out of here.

01:17:51.57,01:17:53.61
Are you OK?

01:17:54.20,01:17:57.44
Look out![br]There's no reason to be so upset.

01:17:57.54,01:18:00.45
She's got no husband,[br]no fiancé, no nothing.

01:18:00.54,01:18:03.08
- You butthead![br]- I checked.

01:18:03.17,01:18:07.29
We're talking about a profound state[br]of unattachment.

01:18:09.97,01:18:14.46
- Did you hear what I said?[br]- Yeah. It doesn't matter any more.

01:18:14.56,01:18:17.63
Watch the feet, for Christ's sake.[br]What's the matter with you?

01:18:19.81,01:18:21.85
Let me get this straight.

01:18:21.94,01:18:25.60
- You were this Margaret Strauss?[br]- That's right.

01:18:25.69,01:18:28.77
The lady with no memory[br]was your husband?

01:18:28.86,01:18:30.69
Roman Strauss.

01:18:30.78,01:18:35.61
And 40 years ago, she killed you,[br]and now she's back again.

01:18:35.71,01:18:37.78
Right.

01:18:37.87,01:18:40.62
It all makes perfect sense.

01:18:40.71,01:18:44.79
This gender switching shit[br]happens all the time.

01:18:44.88,01:18:48.13
You can be Bob in one life[br]and then Betty in the next.

01:18:48.22,01:18:52.76
- Husband in one, wife in the next.[br]- Two halves of the same person.

01:18:52.85,01:18:55.72
From this picture,[br]you look more like him.

01:18:55.81,01:18:59.05
- But what a babe you were.[br]- Come on.

01:19:07.87,01:19:09.90
What happens now?

01:19:10.24,01:19:13.40
Fucking do her, man. Blow her away.

01:19:13.50,01:19:17.66
- What?[br]- One shot, right here.

01:19:17.75,01:19:21.79
- You telling me to kill her?[br]- You do her before she does you.

01:19:21.88,01:19:25.04
I thought karma meant[br]learning from previous lives.

01:19:25.13,01:19:28.79
That's what you learned[br]from this life.

01:19:29.60,01:19:32.84
Karmically,[br]self-defence is quite cool.

01:19:32.93,01:19:34.97
Besides, what you've told me,

01:19:35.06,01:19:38.89
I doubt it's any different today[br]than it was 40 years ago.

01:19:38.98,01:19:41.68
Maybe Roman Strauss[br]didn't kill his wife.

01:19:41.78,01:19:45.90
You know that's not true. He caught[br]her on the phone and killed her.

01:19:45.99,01:19:51.65
- I didn't see him kill her.[br]- If I were you, I'd forget her.

01:19:51.91,01:19:56.66
I can't forget her.[br]I don't know what to do.

01:20:09.18,01:20:11.26
Why would she want[br]to kill me now?

01:20:11.35,01:20:14.47
Why do women do anything?

01:20:14.56,01:20:17.93
Your neighbour said[br]you were mugged one night.

01:20:18.03,01:20:21.85
You seemed OK,[br]but the next night you were gone.

01:20:21.95,01:20:24.19
Your work's still here, though.

01:20:30.37,01:20:32.57
My God!

01:20:34.29,01:20:38.33
- I live here?[br]- Give yourself some time.

01:20:49.06,01:20:51.22
But I don't recognise anything.

01:20:53.61,01:20:55.68
Nothing.

01:20:55.77,01:20:58.23
But you will, my dear. You will.

01:20:58.32,01:21:00.35
She used to paint seascapes.

01:21:01.07,01:21:05.52
Her mind has obviously been stealing[br]visits to the past for some time

01:21:05.62,01:21:09.65
until, apparently, she woke up[br]one night stranded there.

01:21:10.87,01:21:15.12
Why don't you forget all this[br]metaphysical stuff and call Mike?

01:21:15.21,01:21:18.37
I don't think that would[br]be a good idea at all.

01:21:18.47,01:21:22.00
Let me be very honest.[br]At this point, I think it best

01:21:22.10,01:21:26.34
you have no contact whatsoever[br]with Mr Church. None.

01:21:26.43,01:21:29.47
You don't honestly think[br]Mike would hurt her.

01:21:29.56,01:21:32.01
I think they could hurt each other.

01:21:32.11,01:21:35.02
I promise you, my dear,[br]within 24 hours,

01:21:35.61,01:21:39.23
Mr Church will come riding up[br]that lovely old elevator

01:21:39.32,01:21:43.61
with nothing but the sweetest words[br]and the very best intentions.

01:21:43.70,01:21:48.74
He'll have a perfect explanation as[br]to why everything will be just fine.

01:21:48.83,01:21:51.91
Before you know it,[br]you'll be in each other's arms

01:21:52.00,01:21:54.54
and you'll feel warm and safe.

01:21:54.63,01:21:57.50
But I'm telling you[br]right here and now,

01:21:57.59,01:22:01.00
any security you feel[br]will be an illusion.

01:22:01.10,01:22:04.01
I'm telling you,[br]any relationship with Mr Church

01:22:04.10,01:22:06.22
can end only one way - violently.

01:22:06.31,01:22:09.39
I've known Mike forever.[br]He'd never hurt her.

01:22:09.48,01:22:13.89
Mr Dougan, we're talking about fate.[br]If fate works at all,

01:22:13.98,01:22:18.35
it's because people think that[br]this time, it isn't going to happen.

01:22:18.45,01:22:20.27
I don't...

01:22:21.45,01:22:26.03
I've got to run down to the paper for[br]a while. I'll check on you tonight.

01:22:26.12,01:22:28.91
What about tomorrow night[br]and the night after?

01:22:29.00,01:22:31.79
How am I supposed to keep him away?

01:22:31.88,01:22:35.33
If you can't keep him[br]away with words, use this.

01:22:37.01,01:22:39.71
Sorry.[br]It's been in my shop for years.

01:22:39.80,01:22:43.72
It belonged to a famous gangster,[br]Stinky somebody.

01:22:43.81,01:22:47.55
- I can't use that.[br]- It's old, but it still fires.

01:22:47.65,01:22:51.34
- I can't shoot anybody.[br]- Take it all the same.

01:22:51.44,01:22:56.02
You don't honestly believe this[br]stuff, do you? Does Mike?

01:22:56.11,01:22:58.19
He found you again, didn't he?

01:22:58.28,01:23:00.57
I saw you two together[br]the other night.

01:23:00.66,01:23:03.53
You looked good. You looked happy.

01:23:04.37,01:23:07.41
What about that man[br]you told me about?

01:23:07.50,01:23:12.12
That mailman[br]who chopped up his wife and family.

01:23:14.88,01:23:17.63
How happy were they[br]when they first met?

01:23:27.77,01:23:32.06
Yeah? This is Mike Church.[br]Somebody called me.

01:23:32.15,01:23:36.65
Mr Church, someone would[br]like to see you, a Mr Gray Baker.

01:23:43.83,01:23:48.29
He'll ask, but whatever you do,[br]don't let him smoke.

01:24:02.27,01:24:04.09
Gray Baker?

01:24:05.82,01:24:09.51
- Can I have a cigarette?[br]- You're not supposed to smoke.

01:24:09.61,01:24:12.81
I'm dying.[br]What the fuck is the difference?

01:24:12.91,01:24:16.65
I don't want to get in trouble.[br]I just want to...

01:24:16.74,01:24:21.07
You claim someone says[br]they're Margaret Strauss.

01:24:21.62,01:24:25.70
I said that they said that they...

01:24:26.46,01:24:28.58
They were Margaret Strauss.

01:24:30.01,01:24:34.00
You know, in a past life.

01:24:38.10,01:24:42.64
He said it wasn't over.[br]That's what he said to me.

01:24:44.19,01:24:48.27
I assume he meant[br]I hadn't heard the last of him.

01:24:48.36,01:24:51.52
I read a book[br]by Roman's guard on death row.

01:24:51.61,01:24:54.07
He said right before[br]Roman was executed,

01:24:54.16,01:24:56.94
you asked him if he[br]really killed his wife.

01:24:57.04,01:25:00.90
The guard said Roman[br]whispered the answer in your ear.

01:25:02.08,01:25:04.75
- What did he say?[br]- Why do you want to know?

01:25:04.84,01:25:07.20
Mr Baker, did Roman kill his wife?

01:25:10.18,01:25:11.58
No.

01:25:11.68,01:25:16.38
Although, at the time,[br]I honestly thought he did,

01:25:16.48,01:25:21.01
until I went to see him on death row.

01:25:21.11,01:25:22.93
What did he say?

01:25:23.02,01:25:26.48
- Can I have a cigarette?[br]- I don't have any. What did he say?

01:25:26.57,01:25:29.31
- In your pocket.[br]- What did Roman tell you?

01:25:29.41,01:25:32.11
What did Roman tell you?[br]What did Roman tell you?

01:25:32.20,01:25:34.23
Tell me, Mr Baker!

01:25:35.20,01:25:38.11
Take it easy. Are you OK?

01:25:38.21,01:25:40.24
Jesus. Just...

01:25:41.34,01:25:43.37
Want me to get someone?

01:25:58.52,01:26:02.97
May I please have a cigarette?

01:26:03.07,01:26:04.89
Yeah.

01:26:37.44,01:26:40.56
No. Keep them. Really. I just quit.

01:26:42.74,01:26:44.35
He didn't say anything.

01:26:44.45,01:26:46.98
Come on. I gave you[br]a fucking cigarette.

01:26:47.07,01:26:49.86
I'm telling the truth. I asked him...

01:26:49.95,01:26:52.40
But you still killed her.

01:26:55.04,01:26:56.99
Didn't you?

01:27:06.68,01:27:09.75
- He kissed me.[br]- What?

01:27:09.85,01:27:15.64
He kissed me. The bastard[br]leaned over and kissed me,

01:27:15.73,01:27:20.18
and I have not written a word since.

01:27:20.28,01:27:24.48
Who killed her?

01:27:25.57,01:27:29.82
- I don't know.[br]- You've been a big help. Thanks.

01:27:29.91,01:27:31.95
Sit down.

01:27:32.50,01:27:37.45
If anyone would know,[br]it would be the housekeeper.

01:27:37.55,01:27:40.75
- The housekeeper? lngrid something?[br]- Inga.

01:27:40.84,01:27:43.51
She knew everything[br]that went on in that house.

01:27:43.59,01:27:46.55
- She's still alive?[br]- Perhaps.

01:27:46.64,01:27:51.01
Last I heard, they had opened[br]some sort of shop.

01:27:51.10,01:27:53.34
Antiques.

01:27:56.69,01:27:59.14
She and the son[br]opened an antique shop?

01:27:59.24,01:28:01.39
Antiques.

01:28:04.07,01:28:07.69
The Laughing...[br]The Laughing something.

01:28:07.79,01:28:10.19
- On Robertson.[br]- On Robertson.

01:28:40.36,01:28:44.36
Don't forget the rings and jewellery[br]in the bureau drawer.

01:28:44.45,01:28:47.86
Our client wants it to[br]look like simple robbery.

01:28:47.96,01:28:51.45
- That's very important.[br]- OK.

01:28:51.54,01:28:53.87
Let me just check the address again.

01:28:55.42,01:28:58.16
Hi, lnga.

01:29:02.18,01:29:05.55
You know who I am.[br]We don't have much time.

01:29:05.64,01:29:09.05
So before I call the police,[br]I thought I'd stop by,

01:29:09.15,01:29:12.26
see if you'd tell me[br]why you murdered Margaret Strauss.

01:29:12.36,01:29:15.22
What are you doing here?[br]Where's Frankie?

01:29:15.32,01:29:17.69
You know what I'm doing here.

01:29:17.78,01:29:21.69
You loved Roman. I want the truth.[br]I'm not leaving without it.

01:29:21.78,01:29:24.32
You don't know anything.

01:29:35.67,01:29:43.76
I never for a moment thought[br]I was actually in love with him.

01:29:43.85,01:29:50.05
- Until he met Margaret.[br]- First I was really glad.

01:29:50.15,01:29:54.18
Margaret was good to Roman.

01:29:54.28,01:29:58.05
For a while,[br]she was good to Frankie and me, too.

01:30:00.37,01:30:06.73
But then they got married[br]and it all went to hell.

01:30:07.79,01:30:12.70
The day of the murder, I decided[br]to tell Roman how I really felt,

01:30:12.80,01:30:16.04
that we were so much happier[br]before in Germany,

01:30:16.14,01:30:19.46
that we would be happier[br]there now, together.

01:30:19.56,01:30:20.96
I love you.

01:30:21.06,01:30:23.38
But Roman said[br]he could never love me.

01:30:23.48,01:30:27.22
I tried to explain it to Frankie,[br]but he couldn't understand

01:30:27.31,01:30:30.68
that Roman and Margaret[br]truly loved each other.

01:30:30.78,01:30:34.35
Mr Baker,[br]I don't want you to call me any more.

01:30:34.45,01:30:38.11
No, Mr Baker, there's nothing to say.[br]Goodbye.

01:30:44.54,01:30:46.94
- I'm so sorry.[br]- Roman...

01:30:50.51,01:30:53.87
I'm sorry, too.[br]I haven't been very understanding.

01:30:53.97,01:30:57.29
I know you've been unhappy[br]these past months.

01:30:59.31,01:31:01.38
I just couldn't admit it.

01:31:04.44,01:31:07.11
I couldn't admit that[br]you might be unhappy with me.

01:31:07.19,01:31:09.35
Unhappy with you?

01:31:09.44,01:31:13.19
Margaret, I love you.

01:31:17.83,01:31:24.27
So Roman loved Margaret and not me,[br]and Frankie hated her for it.

01:31:25.38,01:31:27.45
I just didn't know how much.

01:31:29.21,01:31:31.61
That same terrible night,

01:31:31.72,01:31:35.92
we heard Roman's opera[br]echoing through the house

01:31:36.01,01:31:39.63
for the first and the last time.

01:31:42.40,01:31:46.34
I didn't know what was happening[br]until it was...

01:31:47.69,01:31:49.68
all over.

01:31:50.99,01:31:52.81
Who's there?

01:31:52.91,01:31:54.94
After the murder,

01:31:57.87,01:32:03.45
Frankie's speech problem[br]got worse and worse,

01:32:03.54,01:32:08.61
so I took him to England,[br]to a specialist.

01:32:10.55,01:32:16.67
The guy used hypnosis to cure him.

01:32:16.77,01:32:22.05
He told him about the subconscious[br]and about reincarnation.

01:32:23.02,01:32:25.06
And from that moment on,

01:32:25.15,01:32:31.11
the boy was obsessed with the idea[br]that Margaret would come after him.

01:32:31.20,01:32:38.24
And when he found your article[br]in the newspaper, he knew.

01:32:38.33,01:32:42.11
So he hired Dougie the fiancé[br]to take her from me?

01:32:42.21,01:32:45.41
His real name's Mark.[br]He's just an actor.

01:32:45.51,01:32:49.08
Jesus![br]I left Grace alone with your son.

01:32:49.18,01:32:51.21
Wait a minute.

01:32:58.35,01:33:00.80
I'm through protecting him.

01:33:35.56,01:33:38.80
- It's all right.[br]- I had to tell him.

01:33:39.77,01:33:43.77
It's all right, Mother.[br]You should be in bed.

01:33:50.08,01:33:52.11
Up we go.

01:34:00.09,01:34:01.91
There.

01:34:07.93,01:34:10.30
Just couldn't live with it any more.

01:34:12.39,01:34:14.43
I understand.

01:34:16.40,01:34:18.80
Good night, Frankie.

01:34:26.07,01:34:28.11
Good night, Mother.

01:35:06.70,01:35:08.65
Shit!

01:36:50.31,01:36:53.72
- Grace, it's Mike. Let me in.[br]- Go away!

01:36:53.82,01:36:57.23
- I need to talk to you.[br]- I'm calling the police.

01:37:09.29,01:37:11.49
I know you're upset.[br]If you'll just listen...

01:37:11.59,01:37:13.62
What did you do to the phone?

01:37:13.71,01:37:16.46
- What are you talking about?[br]- The line is dead.

01:37:16.55,01:37:20.04
It's windy out. Lines are[br]probably out all over the hills.

01:37:20.14,01:37:22.51
- Will you listen?[br]- Just go away!

01:37:38.33,01:37:43.36
Will you just listen to me, OK?

01:37:45.08,01:37:47.32
Don't shoot. Take it easy, Grace.

01:37:47.42,01:37:49.24
Where are you going?

01:37:49.34,01:37:51.37
- I won't hurt you![br]- Go away!

01:37:51.46,01:37:54.08
Take it easy. Look. Listen. Watch.

01:37:54.18,01:37:57.04
Roman did not kill his wife.[br]He was writing the opera.

01:37:57.14,01:37:59.42
Listen, this is for you.

01:38:27.88,01:38:29.79
My god.

01:38:30.92,01:38:32.96
What have I done?

01:38:42.35,01:38:45.10
- Mr Madson.[br]- Good evening.

01:38:49.94,01:38:51.98
I shot him.

01:38:52.70,01:38:57.53
Thank you. Less work for Frankie.

01:38:58.83,01:39:02.07
Who's there? Frankie?

01:39:10.55,01:39:12.92
Antiques.

01:39:19.64,01:39:21.68
This is for you!

01:39:22.73,01:39:25.26
And this is for my mother!

01:40:52.33,01:40:54.15
Margaret?

01:41:29.29,01:41:31.74
It's all over, Frankie!

01:41:34.62,01:41:38.24
- Mike, don't![br]- Pete, stop it!

01:41:39.63,01:41:41.91
Don't!

01:41:51.48,01:41:54.18
I, for one,

01:41:54.27,01:41:57.35
am very interested...

01:41:58.78,01:42:00.14
to see...

01:42:01.82,01:42:03.65
what's going to happen next.

01:42:03.74,01:42:06.22
Somebody help me!

01:43:17.19,01:43:20.60
- I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.[br]- It's OK.

01:43:21.32,01:43:23.40
It's OK.

01:43:26.00,01:43:28.53
The door just closed.
