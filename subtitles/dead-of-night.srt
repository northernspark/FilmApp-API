2
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,534
Ah, Walter Craig?

3
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,287
How do you do?
You're Eliot Foley?

4
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,247
That's right.
So glad you were able to come.

5
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:30,876
Let's have your bag and
put the car away afterwards.

6
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:33,921
It struck me after I telephoned you,
rather cheek on my part

7
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,672
asking a busy architect like yourself

8
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,883
to spend the weekend
with a set of complete strangers.

9
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,218
Not a bit.

10
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:42,304
We're pretty cramped for space here.
We need at least two more bedrooms.

11
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,098
- And with only one living room?
- Yes, only one living room.

12
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,227
However, we'll go into all that
in the morning, shall we?

13
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:57,194
- Know this part of the world at all?
- No, I've never been here before...

14
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:02,157
...not actually.
- Let me take your things.

15
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:05,661
Fancy you spotting that.
Trained professional eye, eh?

16
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,079
Yes, of course.

17
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,665
We've got several other guests,
so I've put you in the barn,

18
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,958
but don't get worried...

19
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,793
It has central heating
and every modern convenience.

20
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,046
The very words I was going to use.
Listen, I expect they've started tea.

21
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,465
Yes... yes, they have.

22
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,972
Mother, this is Mr Craig.

23
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,724
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

24
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:34,940
How do you do?
Well, come along in.

25
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:39,027
Let me introduce you to the others.
Mrs Cortland.

26
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,779
How do you do?

27
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,489
Dr Van Straaten.

28
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,575
How do you do?
Very pleased to meet you.

29
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:49,037
- And, er... Mr Grainger.
- How do you do?

30
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:53,667
- And this is Sally O'Hara.
- How do you do?

31
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:58,171
You must be tired after your drive.
Come and sit over here by the fire.

32
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,299
I can't tell you how delighted I am

33
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,426
you were able to accept
my son's invitation.

34
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,721
You see we are both
such admirers of your work.

35
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,265
You'd like some tea, wouldn't you?

36
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,392
Do you take milk and sugar?

37
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:16,898
Milk and sugar, Mr Craig?

38
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,696
You're still there.
So it isn't a dream this time.

39
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,239
I beg your pardon.

40
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:28,201
As it isn't a dream this time,
I must be going out of my mind.

41
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,786
Of course!

42
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:33,206
Dr Van Straaten.
You're a psychiatrist.

43
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:37,044
You always treat me.
You'll treat me now, won't you?

44
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,629
Forgive me,
I don't quite understand the joke.

45
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:43,467
It isn't a joke. I only wish it were.
I've seen you in my dreams.

46
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,802
Sounds like a sentimental song,
doesn't it?

47
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,388
I've dreamt about you
over and over again, Doctor.

48
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,474
Hardly turns you into a mental case.

49
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,976
After all, recurring dreams
are quite common.

50
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:57,439
But how did I dream about you?
I've never set eyes on you in my life.

51
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,900
Very likely, you've seen
my photograph in the papers.

52
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,027
That's why my face
seems familiar to you.

53
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,445
I don't think so.

54
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:07,657
Even if it were, is that any reason why
I should keep on dreaming about you?

55
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,869
After all,
you don't mean anything to me.

56
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,121
There may be an association of ideas.

57
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,500
I may be linked to something
that means a great deal to you.

58
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,377
Such as?

59
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:21,505
I should have to psychoanalyse you
to find that out.

60
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,131
But it doesn't end there.

61
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:26,968
You see, everybody in this room
is part of my dream. Everybody.

62
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,388
- Gosh!
- Good Lord, really?

63
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,598
- You're kidding!
- What all of us?

64
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:35,477
I can only tell you that when I came
into this room, I recognised you all.

65
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:39,564
Having seen all our photographs in
the newspapers, eh, Dr Van Straaten?

66
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,818
You may have seen me on the sports
page. Motor racing's my line.

67
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,654
And there was one of me once,
in the "Kentish Mercury".

68
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,116
When I was a bridesmaid at
my sister's wedding. You remember?

69
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,410
Oh... But I shouldn't think
you've come across that.

70
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,496
- I've never had my photograph taken.
- Oh, yes, you did dear once.

71
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:57,707
You know the one.
Naked on a fur rug, six months old.

72
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:01,086
Good Lord, that's right. I don't think
he'd recognise me, I was much fatter.

73
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:04,840
Surely, Mr Craig, you might've seen
any of us some time or another.

74
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,384
- In the street or anywhere.
- Yes...

75
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,512
But why should I always dream
about meeting you all together,

76
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:14,391
here in this room that I've never
been in, in my life, until today?

77
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,060
Mr Craig, can you describe
what happens in your dream?

78
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,979
Well, not in detail,

79
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:22,774
but it always starts exactly the same
as when I arrived, just now.

80
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,068
I turn off the main road into the lane.

81
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,487
At the bend in the lane,
the house comes into view.

82
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,739
I stop, because I recognise it.

83
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:33,368
Then I drive on again,
and Foley meets me at the front door.

84
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,454
I recognise him, too.

85
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,916
And then, when I'm taking off my coat,
I have the most extraordinary feeling.

86
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,127
I nearly turn and run for it,

87
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:45,422
because I know I am going to come
face to face with the six of you.

88
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:49,634
Well, you've only come face to face
with five of us so far, not counting Eliot.

89
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,428
That's right. Five of you.

90
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,513
There is a sixth person
who comes in later.

91
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,515
Can you describe this late arrival?

92
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:59,478
- It's an attractive girl with dark hair.
- Is that you can tell us about her?

93
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,605
She comes in quite unexpectedly,

94
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,566
and says something about
not having any money.

95
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,985
- A penniless brunette, eh?
- How romantic.

96
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,446
Do you fall madly in love
with her Mr Craig?

97
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,698
Have you ever told
anyone about your dream?

98
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:15,952
No, I don't think so.
Not even my wife.

99
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,455
Now I come to think of it,
after I wake,

100
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,208
it never stays in my memory
for more than a few seconds.

101
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,919
And none of it ever comes back to me
until the next time it starts.

102
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:27,464
In fact, there's no evidence you ever
dreamed this dream at all, is there?

103
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,175
None whatever.
I haven't a scrap of proof.

104
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,553
Personally, I don't need any.
I believe what you say, Mr Craig.

105
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,764
I believe you really have dreamt
about us all.

106
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,224
- So do I.
- And so do I.

107
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,060
- Me too!
- I think I do, too.

108
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:44,481
I don't question that you have been
subject to a recurring dream,

109
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,567
and no doubt it has a background
vaguely similar to this.

110
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,903
It would be quite enough
to account for your feeling

111
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,323
that you've been here before,
it's quite a common experience.

112
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:56,535
- And that's all there is to it?
- That's all there is to it!

113
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,578
I must say it's very disappointing

114
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:02,749
not to be a leading character
in some supernatural drama, after all!

115
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,751
- Cigarettes, anyone?
- You never know...

116
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,837
...perhaps it's like the Red King's dream
in "Alice Through The Looking Glass".

117
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:12,050
None of us exist at all. We're nothing
but characters in Mr Craig's dream.

118
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:16,221
That's right, and when he wakes up,
we shall all vanish into thin air.

119
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,640
Dear me, what a morbid notion!

120
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,559
Let's get this straight, Doctor,

121
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,353
you won't for a moment admit
the possibility of foreseeing the future?

122
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,896
Not for a moment.

123
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:27,899
You'd say I was a pretty ordinary,
down-to-earth person, wouldn't you?

124
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,068
I refuse to commit myself. Why?

125
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:32,612
When it comes to seeing the future,
something once happened to me

126
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,073
that knocks your theories
into a cocked hat.

127
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,200
Something I'll not forget
to my dying day.

128
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:40,161
Matter of fact,
it very nearly was my dying day.

129
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,592
Now's my chance. I can't make it!

130
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,679
I can't make it!

131
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,431
Yes, I can...

132
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,937
This is it... Oh! Oh!

133
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:08,398
How long is it since the crash, Nurse?
Six days?

134
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,025
No, seven, Doctor.

135
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,360
There's no injury to the brain,
I'm certain of that.

136
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,404
His mind cleared completely
this morning.

137
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,115
He asked about the other driver.
I told him he was unhurt.

138
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,618
He slept quite peacefully
for the next two hours.

139
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,828
It's his temperature that worries me.

140
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:25,540
Let me know at once if it goes up again.
I shall be in number 18.

141
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,804
You're here, Peggy?
All the way from Scotland?

142
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,015
All the way from Scotland.

143
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,143
But... you're not Peggy, are you?

144
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:48,271
No, I'm awfully sorry.
You've been calling me Peggy for days.

145
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,898
My name's Joyce.

146
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,400
There's something
sort of soothing about you.

147
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,861
- You'll not leave me, will you?
- I won't.

148
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:59,032
- Promise?
- If you promise to go quietly to sleep.

149
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,034
Anything you say...

150
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:06,581
'From then on, my temperature
began to slide back to normal.

151
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:09,834
'It was a grand job of nursing
on Joyce's part.'

152
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,423
Tell me frankly, darling.
Am I out of the wood yet?

153
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:18,510
Well, you've stopped being delirious.
At least, I think so.

154
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,845
It's hard to tell,
you talk such nonsense!

155
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,098
- I still have awful bad nightmares.
- Nightmares?

156
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,392
I thought you said
you always dreamt about me.

157
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:29,104
So I do. I dream you turn me down
and get married to Dr Albury instead.

158
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,981
You needn't worry.
He has a wife and three children.

159
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,692
Oh, good for him.

160
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,949
It's a lovely night.

161
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,419
Quarter to ten.
Long past your bedtime.

162
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,129
Darling, I put it to you.

163
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,506
Only one way to cure me permanently,
and that's to marry me!

164
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,718
- It's your professional duty.
- You've got a hope!

165
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,807
- Good night.
- Good night, darling.

166
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,785
Just room for one inside, sir!

167
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:37,458
It couldn't have been a dream.
I hadn't had time to fall asleep.

168
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,294
Nurse had only just left me.

169
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,046
You checked the time,
it was no more than five minutes.

170
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:46,009
- Does that mean I'm going crackers?
- My dear chap, of course not.

171
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,136
In the split second
before your car crashed,

172
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:51,347
you were firmly convinced you were
going to be killed, weren't you?

173
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:54,350
- Yes. Yes, I was.
- That fear has remained with you.

174
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:57,687
I wasn't conscious of it.
You mean my subconscious mind?

175
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:00,398
You'd already passed
the purely physical crisis.

176
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:03,985
That apparition of death is what
we call the psychological crisis.

177
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,696
Yes, maybe.
But suppose I go on seeing things?

178
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,072
You won't.

179
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,450
I'll lay you 2 to 1 in pounds,
we'll have you out of here in a week.

180
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,328
It's a bet. If I lose, I win.

181
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,708
'As a matter of fact, I won.
That is, I lost, if you see what I mean.

182
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,628
'Albury was right,
I made marvellous headway,

183
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:25,465
'and was able to leave the nursing
home before the week was over.'

184
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,887
Excuse me,
can you tell me the time?

185
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:34,098
- Yes, it's quarter past four.
- Thanks.

186
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,064
Just room for one inside, sir.

187
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:16,224
So you see, if I hadn't seen
that man driving the hearse,

188
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,393
I wouldn't be alive to tell the tale.

189
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,770
Bit sick for the passengers on the bus.

190
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,106
Yes, the hearse driver
might've tipped them off, too!

191
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,691
Perhaps he did,

192
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:28,194
but perhaps they were all Doubting
Thomases like Dr Van Straaten.

193
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,321
This time you have got
your evidence, Doctor.

194
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,615
Mr Grainger told the specialist
about the hearse

195
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,409
before he went to catch the bus.

196
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,327
I'm afraid that does not prove

197
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,538
the bus conductor had
the features of the hearse driver

198
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,916
or that he said,
"Just room for one inside."

199
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:45,128
But he had and he did.
Nothing will ever shake me.

200
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,380
That hearse driver was sent to me
as a warning.

201
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,632
I agree. Otherwise,
why didn't he board the bus?

202
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,719
- Exactly.
- He hadn't recovered completely yet.

203
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,971
Your were still obsessed by your crash.

204
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:58,057
It made you reluctant to board
any kind of vehicle, didn't it?

205
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,394
- Sorry, Doctor, I'll not buy that one.
- Well, maybe it's as well.

206
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,646
You cling to your belief, my boy,

207
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:07,442
that providence is specially
concerned about your survival.

208
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:11,404
No use, Grainger. We're both in the
same boat. We'll never convince him.

209
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,240
What Dr Van Straaten wants
is genuine first-hand evidence.

210
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,659
The kind that would satisfy
judge and jury.

211
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:20,413
And neither of us has been
able to produce that... yet.

212
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,583
Darling, where on earth
did you spring from?

213
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,461
Brenda suddenly changed her mind
about staying up in town.

214
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,547
Would you pay the taxi?
I spent my last penny on the train fare.

215
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:32,550
- Hello, Eliot.
- Hello, Joyce.

216
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:36,637
Oh, your penniless brunette.
All right, I'll pay the taxi.

217
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,474
... I made a dash
for Charing Cross and caught the 3:15.

218
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,434
A delightful surprise,
my dear.

219
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,437
Though no surprise to Mr Craig.
Let me introduce you.

220
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,981
Mr Craig, Mrs Grainger,
your dream come true.

221
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,567
Yes, she's the sixth person.

222
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,779
Sixth person? Are you playing
some sort of a game?

223
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,781
Well, not exactly a game,
my dear.

224
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,408
Mr Craig has been dreaming
about you for years.

225
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:59,577
Not only you darling,
all of us.

226
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:03,039
Come upstairs and take your things off.
It's all perfectly simple really.

227
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,083
- Just like your husband's hearse.
- Oh?

228
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:08,002
I don't mean his hearse,
I mean the one he saw

229
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,712
when he was in your nursing home.

230
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,714
Or the one Dr Van Straaten said
he didn't see.

231
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,217
Oh, dear,
I think I'd better start again.

232
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:17,553
Mr Craig has been having
the most frightful dreams...

233
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,722
Penniless brunette
laid on according to plan.

234
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:23,392
- How's that for evidence, Doctor?
- You'll say it's a pure coincidence.

235
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,105
- You can't say that, Doctor.
- The odds are a million to one against.

236
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,482
I am a little indignant.

237
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:33,736
I am driven to the conclusion it's all part
of a very carefully prearranged plan.

238
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:36,989
An extraordinarily elaborate
practical joke at my expense.

239
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,118
- Oh, really!
- You think we cooked the whole thing up?

240
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:44,205
As an explanation, it's not any more
farfetched than Mr Craig's.

241
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:47,291
The jokes on me, too,
for I didn't know anything about it.

242
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,794
A funny sort of practical joke.
It isn't funny.

243
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,840
What conceivable motive do you
think we possibly could've had?

244
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,134
No doubt you thought
it would be very amusing

245
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,594
to watch my cherished disbeliefs
being shattered.

246
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,972
Very clever of us, I must say.

247
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:04,475
I wonder if we have any more
surprises up our sleeves?

248
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:08,646
- That's it! Your glasses.
- What about my glasses?

249
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,649
It's later on,
we're having drinks,

250
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:14,068
you break those glasses of yours,

251
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:17,280
and then, quite suddenly,
the room goes dark.

252
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,615
Then, Foley, you say something,

253
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:23,035
something about the death of a man
I've never heard of.

254
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,913
And that's where my dream
becomes a nightmare,

255
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,665
a nightmare of horror.

256
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,293
Horror? What sort of horror?

257
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,296
I feel my will power draining away.

258
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,756
I feel I'm in the grip of a force
that's driving me

259
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,176
towards something unspeakably evil.

260
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,970
It shows that you have some heavy
weight on your conscience.

261
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:42,889
Now, in my opinion...

262
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,349
I'm no longer interested
in your opinion, Doctor.

263
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:48,394
You shook me at first
with your ingenious theories.

264
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,230
I thought perhaps
the whole thing was a delusion.

265
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,941
But Mrs Grainger's arrival
has altered all that.

266
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:57,320
I have been here before
in my dream.

267
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,865
For some reason, I was given
foreknowledge of the future.

268
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,826
Why? I don't know.

269
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:07,163
I want to know. I must know.

270
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,463
Sally, dear, I think perhaps it's time
you were going off home now.

271
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:19,091
Mother means she wouldn't want
your infant mind warped, my pretty.

272
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,136
I'm sorry, Sally. I didn't mean
my fear to frighten you.

273
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:25,973
It's all right, Mr Craig, it didn't.
All the same, I'll go, if you like.

274
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:29,560
But it seems rather silly to me,
considering I've had some myself.

275
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,979
- Some what?
- Subconscious thingamajigs.

276
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,774
Or whatever Dr Van Straaten
makes out they are.

277
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,443
I had an absolutely staggering one
last year.

278
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,862
Save it up for the school magazine.
Run along home.

279
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,949
Thanks for the nice tea, Eliot,
and for calling me a liar.

280
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,618
- Good afternoon.
- Please let her stay, Mrs Foley.

281
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,120
I should like to hear about
your subconscious thingamajigs.

282
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,332
You would?
Not that it'll cut any ice with you.

283
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,585
Well, we were spending Christmas
down in Somerset.

284
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:58,172
I'd been asked over to a party by
an old school friend of my mother's.

285
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:01,133
A Mrs Watson.
There were a lot of other kids there.

286
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,594
'Mostly younger than
Jimmy Watson and myself,

287
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,097
'so we let them choose the games.'

288
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,691
Nobody else could have
such a silly nose. It's Jimmy.

289
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,444
Well, you should talk!

290
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:27,576
- What shall we play now?
- Musical chairs!

291
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:31,580
- Sardines!
- All right, sardines, it is.

292
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:32,999
Sardines?

293
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,377
Don't you know about sardines?
It's a sort of hide-and-seek.

294
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:39,880
Who's to hide? All right.

295
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,509
Anywhere in the house, bar the kitchen.
Cook's in a state.

296
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:47,096
- But I don't know my way about the house.
- So much the worse for you.

297
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:50,224
I'll count 30.
Turn your backs, everyone!

298
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:56,147
One, two, three, four, five,

299
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:59,817
six, seven, eight, nine,

300
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:05,990
ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen,
fourteen, fifteen, sixteen,

301
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:09,910
seventeen, eighteen,
nineteen, twenty,

302
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:15,583
twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three,
twenty-four, twenty-five,

303
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,919
twenty-six,
twenty-seven, twenty-eight,

304
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,838
twenty-nine, thirty!

305
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:24,050
Off you go! Come on, quickly!

306
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,725
- Got you!
- It's all right. I'll go quietly.

307
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,686
Shh! I'll stop here with you.

308
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:38,981
When somebody else finds us,
they pack in, too, like sardines.

309
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:41,192
Oh, it's cold in here.

310
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,943
Cold, eh?

311
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,363
- That better?
- Hmm...

312
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:49,825
No mortal cold, Sally.
It's a cold from beyond the grave.

313
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:51,452
What are you talking about?

314
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:55,081
Believe it or not,
this house is haunted.

315
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:59,293
- I don't believe it.
- Everyone around here says it is.

316
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:02,671
- I'll bite. Tell me!
- Shh!

317
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:08,010
They're bound to find us here.
I know a much better place. Come on.

318
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:19,688
Go on about your precious ghost.

319
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:25,236
There was a murder committed here
in 1860, I think it was. Come on.

320
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:28,322
The girl who did it
must've been crackers, I suppose.

321
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,783
Strangled him,
then half cut his head off.

322
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:35,037
- How revolting.
- There's lots more, but you're too young.

323
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:38,999
- And where does the ghost come in?
- Well, I don't know, really.

324
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:42,503
Nobody's heard or seen anything
actually. We've been here 6 months.

325
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:47,091
I expect it's the girl going around
in a long white nightgown.

326
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,843
Whistling winds...

327
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,847
Clanking chains...

328
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,766
Blood curdling screams.

329
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:58,686
I suppose she's seeking
forgiveness for her crime.

330
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:04,191
- Search me. Give us a kiss, Sal.
- No, it's against the rules for sardines!

331
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:17,288
Hi, Sally! Sally, wait for me!

332
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,662
Who's that?

333
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:16,847
What is it, darling?
Come on now, stop crying.

334
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:18,807
Did you get separated
from the others?

335
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,852
Let's go downstairs,
where it's nice and warm.

336
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:26,524
No. Stay with me.
It's better now you've come.

337
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:31,362
Isn't it silly of me? I don't remember
noticing you downstairs.

338
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:37,785
- Are you one of the Headingly children?
- My name is Francis, Francis Kent.

339
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,746
It is my bedroom,
mine and Constance's.

340
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,582
- Constance?
- She's my half-sister.

341
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:47,878
- She's grown up, like you.
- I didn't notice her either.

342
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:50,464
All the other girls seem
much younger than me.

343
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:54,176
I wish you were my sister.
You're so kind and nice.

344
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:57,346
Why? Is she unkind to you, darling?

345
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,807
She hates me.
She said she'd like to kill me.

346
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:03,310
Oh, don't. You poor little thing.

347
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:07,273
But I'll be quite safe now,
now that I've met you.

348
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:11,068
I'll be able to sleep.

349
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:14,947
Poor Francis.
Come along, I'll help you.

350
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,243
Has anyone tried the playroom?

351
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,870
Nanny insisted on locking it
and she's got the key.

352
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,831
Gosh!

353
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:27,459
We've forgotten the linen cupboard.
Come on!

354
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:44,310
♪ Smiles awake you
when you rise

355
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:48,355
♪ Sleep, pretty darling

356
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:52,985
♪ Do not cry

357
00:26:53,111 --> 00:27:00,868
♪ And I will sing a lullaby... ♪

358
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,287
- Good night.
- Goodbye.

359
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:13,839
- Sally! Sally, Where are you?
- Please, give up.

360
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:21,180
- I can't find her anywhere. Sally!
- Sally! Sally?

361
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,475
- It's all right. Here I am.
- There you are!

362
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,769
I was wondering
where on earth you'd got to.

363
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,730
I found another door behind a wardrobe,
then along a corridor.

364
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:32,274
- Then into the room at the end.
- Oh, there?

365
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,736
But that's where
the whole thing happened. Sally!

366
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:41,867
- Meet your new nanny, Mrs Watson.
- What do you mean, dear?

367
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,786
I found myself in a sort of nursery.

368
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,205
I didn't know any of the children
were staying the night.

369
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,248
- Staying the night?
- Why, yes.

370
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:51,210
This little boy said he was sharing
a room with his sister.

371
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:55,464
- Which little boy?
- He told me his name was... erm...

372
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,675
...Francis Kent.

373
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:01,970
- Francis Kent?
- Come off it! So you knew all the time?

374
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,347
Knew what?

375
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:07,476
About Constance Kent murdering
her brother, Francis, of course.

376
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:11,522
I didn't know.
So that little boy was...

377
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:15,484
I'm not frightened...
I'm not frightened!

378
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:19,488
Oh! Please hold me tight...
hold me tight!

379
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,868
Mother said I must be sickening
for something,

380
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:27,413
and made me stay in bed
with three hot water bottles.

381
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,666
She didn't believe a word of it,
anymore than Dr Van Straaten does.

382
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,960
In the past, of course,

383
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:36,130
that type of experience was
very frequent among saints.

384
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:40,217
St Joan, for example, and St Theresa
record some visitations

385
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:42,302
of an exceedingly tangible character.

386
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:45,597
- I'm in jolly good company then.
- Not at all, my dear.

387
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:49,810
I decline to believe that you are
on such an exalted spiritual plane.

388
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:52,688
I think you are all being
ridiculously weak-minded,

389
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,190
letting Dr Van Straaten
lay down the law.

390
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:57,735
When I was a nurse,
I came across a lot of things

391
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,863
that doctors didn't just dismiss
in an airy fashion.

392
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,782
I believe in Sally's story
and in Mr Craig's dream.

393
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,325
Good for you!

394
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:09,037
We're powerless in grip of Craig's dream.
That's a solemn thought!

395
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,415
I think it's awfully exciting.

396
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:14,710
If I am a puppet
and Mr Craig is pulling the strings,

397
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:19,631
at least he can tell me more
about the part he's giving me to play.

398
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,551
I wish it were as easy as that.

399
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:27,514
Trying to remember a dream is like...
How shall I put it?

400
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,100
...being out at night
in a thunderstorm.

401
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:31,977
There's a flash of lightning,

402
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:35,522
and for one brief moment,
everything stands out vivid and starkly.

403
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:38,525
And what have the lightning flashes
illuminated so far?

404
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:43,906
One thing is very vivid and very horrible.
I hit Sally savagely, viciously.

405
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:47,576
Oh, no, you won't, I shall stick close
to Mr Grainger. He's bigger than you.

406
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,579
But, anyway, it isn't consistent.

407
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:54,458
I shan't have a chance to, because
you leave quite soon, quite suddenly.

408
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:57,544
- You're certain of that?
- Absolutely certain.

409
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:01,757
Splendid. Then I suggest Sally stays
to dinner. That'll break the spell.

410
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,467
An admirable suggestion.

411
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:07,971
- Thrilling. I'll ring mother and get her OK.
- Tell her Eliot will run you back in the car.

412
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:10,974
- Mother!
- Really, Sally, this is too bad!

413
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,769
Oh, good afternoon, Mrs Foley,
do please forgive this invasion.

414
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,230
You know quite well
it's your Uncle Edwin's birthday.

415
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:19,608
Actually, he's her godfather,
but she always calls him uncle.

416
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:22,486
And not to leave a message!
Of course I guessed you'd be here.

417
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:25,572
She must be a thorough nuisance.
Come along, we're hours late.

418
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:29,576
But I can't! This is Mr Craig, and
I'm one of the characters in his dream.

419
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:33,247
How do you do? Such fun, charades.
You do understand, don't you?

420
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,833
Poor Edwin's so terribly sensitive.
Come along, dear.

421
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:39,169
Mother, listen. You see Mr Craig
is going to hit me savagely.

422
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:41,421
I'm sure he can hit
somebody else instead.

423
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:45,592
Now come along, dear. Don't forget
you're dining with us on Tuesday...

424
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,264
That'll teach you to mess about
with Mr Craig's dream, Ma.

425
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,266
Really, I don't know what to say.

426
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:55,435
I am surprised Mr Craig didn't
remember Sally's mother.

427
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,521
She seems to me
most memorable.

428
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:00,357
Look, Doctor, if Craig had told you
she was coming

429
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:02,860
and exactly what she'd be wearing
and the very words she'd say,

430
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,903
you'd still have thought
the dream was all baloney.

431
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,781
- Good for you, darling!
- I'm becoming quite alarmed.

432
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:12,703
By the end of this evening, I shall be
just as credulous as any of you.

433
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:17,124
Mr Craig, I can only say the more
incredulous the doctor becomes...

434
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,376
...the more I believe you.
- Thank you.

435
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:23,005
Doctor, I'd hoped you'd be able
to explain to me a happening

436
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,966
which, to put it mildly,
has always puzzled me.

437
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:28,010
I shall try.

438
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:31,054
It started a few weeks
after we'd become engaged.

439
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,348
It was April 9th, to be exact.

440
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:36,435
I remember the date,
because it was Peter's birthday.

441
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,021
'You know how difficult it is,
choosing presents for a man.

442
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,481
'They always seem to have
everything they want.'

443
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:52,451
- Oh, hello, darling.
- Hello, sweet.

444
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,995
Take it through, will you?

445
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:59,666
- What on earth's that?
- Just a little birthday present.

446
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:01,627
Put it on the couch, will you?

447
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,963
- What is it, a kite?
- Why don't you open it and see?

448
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,758
Right. Suppose you fix us a drink?

449
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,933
- You haven't had your portrait painted?
- No.

450
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,810
I thought you'd like to look
at yourself.

451
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,943
- Darling, it's a beauty.
- You really like it?

452
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,194
Love it.

453
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,613
It's an improvement on that
barbola thing your aunt gave you.

454
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,406
Yes, that is pretty grim.

455
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:34,952
Always felt I was looking at a gift horse
in the mouth. This is a honey.

456
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,996
- Where did you find it?
- Chichester. Very expensive.

457
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,207
Happy birthday, darling.

458
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:45,420
- What sort of journey did you have?
- Came by road. Got a lift.

459
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:48,382
Don't tell me, let me guess.
Not old faithful?

460
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,092
Hmm, the same.

461
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:53,220
Poor old Guy.
What will he do when we get married?

462
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,389
Hardly the big-game shooting type, is he?

463
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:59,267
Hardly. He nearly put us into a ditch
coming up, trying to avoid a rabbit.

464
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,019
Fellow feeling, obviously.

465
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:04,481
You be careful, I'm very fond of Guy.

466
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:08,610
You mean it pleases your disgusting
feminine vanity to have him on a string.

467
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:11,071
A spaniel would do just as well.

468
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,782
Spaniels don't have nice
comfortable Bentleys, do they?

469
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:16,326
Perhaps you've got something there.

470
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:21,373
- How's that?
- Most professional.

471
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,752
I'm glad to see you're going
to be useful about the house.

472
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:30,465
Hmm... handsome couple.

473
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,927
What's the matter?

474
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:36,304
Nothing. I thought I saw something.

475
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,890
- What sort of something?
- Don't know quite.

476
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,351
What, a little man about so high
in a bowler hat?

477
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:45,564
- What have you been drinking for lunch?
- One pint of bitter.

478
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:51,570
- I think I've been very generous.
- So do I. Nicest present I've ever had.

479
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,740
What shall we do tonight?
Dress up, spend a lot of money?

480
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,074
Why not?

481
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:34,821
- Should've worn our grass skirts.
- Well, we've danced enough anyway.

482
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:47,542
- Darling, is anything the matter?
- No. Why?

483
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:51,171
I don't know. You seem to have
been a bit broody all evening.

484
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,673
A bit limp with the heat, I expect.

485
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,135
- Sure there's nothing the matter?
- No, nothing. Really.

486
00:34:57,261 --> 00:35:00,138
That usually means there is
something really. What is it?

487
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:04,810
- It sounds so damn silly.
- Never mind. Tell me.

488
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,813
Well, you know that mirror
you gave me...

489
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,148
You didn't get it at a joke shop,
by any chance?

490
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,025
No, of course not. Why?

491
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:15,654
Well, when I was dressing this evening,
just as I was tying my tie,

492
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,365
I suddenly realised
the reflection was all wrong.

493
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,991
What do you mean, "wrong"?

494
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,120
Well, it wasn't my room I was seeing,
it was some other room.

495
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:26,289
- Darling!
- I told you it sounded silly.

496
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:29,167
It only lasted for a moment,
but I could've sworn I saw it.

497
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:32,212
Some sort of optical illusion,
I suppose.

498
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,798
All done with mirrors, in fact.

499
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:53,043
'The next few weeks,
we were pretty busy house-hunting.

500
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,754
'In the end, we found
quite a pleasant house in Chelsea.

501
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,174
'And of course, I had all the usual chaos
getting ready for the wedding.

502
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:03,637
'I noticed that Peter seemed
preoccupied and a bit jumpy and irritable.

503
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:06,223
'But I thought it was just
eve-of-wedding nerves.

504
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:10,685
'Anyhow, I was so busy, I didn't have
time to think much about it.'

505
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,481
Phew, what a day!

506
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:18,777
Helen's got measles, so I'll have to find
another bridesmaid somewhere.

507
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,655
The cake's under control,
and I've had a lot more answers.

508
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:24,074
The Laughtons can't come,
thank heaven.

509
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,576
We've got some perfectly
frightful presents.

510
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:31,248
I really think we'll have to turn that
spare room into a chamber of horrors.

511
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:35,210
Which reminds me, when are
the men coming to lay the carpet?

512
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,254
I don't know. I forgot to ring up.

513
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,632
Oh, I'm getting fallen arches
chasing around getting things done

514
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,301
and you can't even remember
a simple telephone call.

515
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,428
For heaven's sake, don't nag!

516
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:50,558
Sorry, I didn't mean to say that.

517
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:55,730
Peter, what's the matter with you?
You've been edgy for days.

518
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:59,484
Yes, I know.
I haven't been sleeping too well.

519
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,240
I really am sorry, darling.

520
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:08,034
Oh, it doesn't matter. Forget it.

521
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:21,423
Listen, darling, I know you fairly well.
You're keeping something from me.

522
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,633
What is it?

523
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:28,346
Well, if you must know,
it's that mirror.

524
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:31,433
You remember me telling you
that first evening?

525
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,894
Well, it's got worse.
Much worse.

526
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:38,148
Every time I look in it now,
I see that room.

527
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:42,110
It's getting me down.
I'd really rather not talk about it.

528
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:46,781
You'll feel much better if you do.
It's no good bottling things up.

529
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:51,202
Well...

530
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:55,665
...at first, if I made
an enormous effort of will,

531
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:59,753
the reflection used to change
back to what it ought to be.

532
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:05,091
But lately, however hard I try,
it doesn't change anymore.

533
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:11,097
The only thing to do
is to try not to look in it at all.

534
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:14,100
But in a queer sort of way
it fascinates me.

535
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:17,395
I feel as if that room,
the one in the mirror,

536
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,690
were trying to... to claim me,

537
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:24,736
...to draw me into it.

538
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:30,283
It almost becomes the real room
and my own bedroom imaginary.

539
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:39,084
And I know there's something waiting
for me on the other side of the mirror.

540
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,086
Something evil.

541
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,421
Monstrously evil.

542
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:49,761
And if I cross that dividing line,
something awful will happen.

543
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:57,435
Well, let's get rid
of the beastly thing.

544
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:00,355
You don't have to keep it
just because I've given it to you.

545
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,399
I can take it back
and they'll change it.

546
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:07,362
The trouble's not in the mirror,
it's in my mind. It must be.

547
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:10,448
A mirror's just wood and glass.

548
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:13,410
Peter, I don't know what to say.

549
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:16,746
Perhaps you're overworked.
Why don't you see a doctor?

550
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:19,958
I have. He couldn't find
anything wrong with me.

551
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:23,920
- I'll have to see a mental specialist.
- Oh, nonsense! You're as sane as I am.

552
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:26,256
Obviously, I can't be!

553
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:35,974
Listen...
I've been putting off saying this.

554
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,935
But I think we ought
to postpone the wedding.

555
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:44,441
- That's a bit drastic, isn't it?
- I don't know. Suppose I am going mad?

556
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:48,570
Wouldn't be much fun for you, would it?
Take you five years to get a divorce.

557
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:51,489
Really, darling, you're going
a little bit too fast for me.

558
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:55,618
Let's get the wedding over, then we can
make divorce arrangements afterwards.

559
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,500
Peter, come with me, will you?

560
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:16,806
Look in the mirror.

561
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:24,314
What is it, darling?

562
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,025
It's worse than ever.

563
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,404
- You're not there.
- 'But of course I'm there.'

564
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:34,991
I tell you, you're not.
In the other room, I'm alone.

565
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:41,748
Look in the mirror and
tell me exactly what you see.

566
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,632
It's just as it always is.

567
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:53,801
Instead of my bed,
there's the other bed.

568
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,304
I can see it quite clearly.

569
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:59,349
The posts have vine leaves
twisted round them,

570
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:02,185
with bunches of grapes at the top.

571
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:05,104
The hangings are dark red silk.

572
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:07,232
The walls are panelled.

573
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,109
There's a log fire burning in the grate.

574
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:13,655
It's no use, I tell you!
I am going mad.

575
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:18,034
Now I'll tell you what I see.

576
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,788
No four-poster,
no panelling and no log fires.

577
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:25,166
Just your ordinary room
with you and me in it.

578
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:27,794
Listen to me...

579
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,298
You're going to look in this mirror again
and see exactly the same as I do.

580
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,509
Come here. Come here.

581
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:43,810
- 'Can you see your own room? '
- No.

582
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:46,354
- 'Or me? '
- No.

583
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,149
- 'But you must! Make yourself.'
- I can't.

584
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:53,194
You can, darling, if you try.

585
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,572
- It's no good.
- You can.

586
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:58,950
Look, here I am, standing by you.

587
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:06,708
Yes...

588
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:11,921
Yes, there you are.
I can see you now.

589
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:14,257
You see? I told you so.

590
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,470
I can't make it out.

591
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:22,890
Come on, let's get out of here
and have a drink.

592
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:25,101
'So that seemed to be that.

593
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:28,730
'A fortnight later, we got married
and moved into the new house.

594
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:31,524
'In a way, I'd have been happier
to get rid of the mirror,

595
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,152
'but Peter seemed to have
lost his fear of it,

596
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:37,030
'so I decided to let things be.'

597
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:48,374
Mother says, can we come down
the weekend after next. It's her birthday.

598
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,628
I shan't be able to make it.
We're rushing that big audit through.

599
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:55,048
Oh, never mind. She'll be disappointed,
but we can go some other time.

600
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,342
Well, you can go, sweet, anyhow,
even if I can't.

601
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,218
I don't want to go without you.

602
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:02,639
I don't want you to. But your mother
would rather have you alone.

603
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:05,433
You know, getting her precious
daughter back for a few days.

604
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:09,979
Don't be an idiot. She doesn't feel she's
lost a daughter. She's gained a son.

605
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:12,899
What gift for a phrase you have!

606
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,984
Think it over, anyhow.

607
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,784
- Hello?
- 'Hello, Peter.'

608
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,911
Hello, darling.
Have a good journey?

609
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:28,373
- 'Yes. I wish you could've come.'
- So do I. Still, it can't be helped.

610
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,625
- 'Do you miss me? '
- Of course I do.

611
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:33,419
- Do you miss me?
- 'Yes. Gone to bed yet? '

612
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:35,922
No, I'm going to do another
half an hour's work first.

613
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,883
- 'Well, good night, darling.'
- Good night, darling. See you Monday.

614
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:41,469
- Give my love to your mother.
- 'Yes. Goodnight, darling.'

615
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:43,262
Goodnight, darling.

616
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:13,292
- 'Toll number, please? '
- Flaxman 6061.

617
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:17,588
Get me Chichester 2352.
Thank you.

618
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,834
- What is it, dear?
- Nothing.

619
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:58,087
I want to speak to Mr Rutherford.

620
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:00,173
Would you go to the library,
and walk back this way?

621
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,049
Very well, dear.

622
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:10,683
- Morning, Mr Rutherford.
- Good morning, Miss Walsh...

623
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:13,060
...I beg your pardon, Mrs Cortland.

624
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:16,355
Do you remember that Chippendale
mirror I bought here 3 months ago?

625
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,983
Indeed I do. I hope your husband
was satisfied with it.

626
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:21,152
Yes, very. Tell me...

627
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:26,324
- That bed, the four-poster...
- How odd you should mention it.

628
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:30,369
It so happens, I bought it
at the same sale that I got your mirror.

629
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:33,790
There's a curious history
attaching to them both.

630
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:37,126
- Curious?
- Well, tragic, perhaps I should say.

631
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:39,587
I trust, by the way,
you're not superstitious.

632
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:42,632
No... No, I don't think so.

633
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,634
Won't you sit down?

634
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,096
Some people retain a medieval attitude
of mind with regard to these matters.

635
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:52,183
Please, Mr Rutherford,
tell me the story, I'm very interested.

636
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:53,726
By all means.

637
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:58,231
The bed and the mirror form part of
the contents of the private apartments

638
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:03,694
of a Mr Francis Etherington,
who died at Marsden Lacy in 1836.

639
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:09,534
The apartments had remained unused
and locked from that time till the sale.

640
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:13,162
That is his portrait, by the way.

641
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:15,373
He was a man of dominating character.

642
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:21,128
Arrogant, reckless, handsome
and of a violent temper.

643
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:24,924
He married a very beautiful heiress,
a Miss Perry.

644
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:28,845
The couple retired to Marsden Lacy
where they lived contentedly for a time.

645
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:32,849
Then suddenly, disaster overtook them.

646
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,475
Out hunting one day,

647
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:37,520
Etherington was thrown by his horse,
which then rolled on him.

648
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:39,397
His spine was injured.

649
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:43,067
He was never again able to do more than
drag himself a few paces from this bed.

650
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:46,112
- How dreadful.
- Yes...

651
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:48,447
Unfortunately,
the effects of such constraint

652
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:53,327
on a man of his enormous energy
were more than his mind could endure.

653
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:57,707
He became morose, embittered,
suspicious, above all, of his wife.

654
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:01,961
Quite without reason, he began accusing
the poor lady of betraying him.

655
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:04,255
With his friends,

656
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,048
with strangers,

657
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:08,175
with his servants.

658
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,970
Had she not been so devoted to him,
she certainly would've left him,

659
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:15,141
and indeed it would've been
better for her had she done so.

660
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:19,896
For one day,
in an excess of jealous rage,

661
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:24,317
he strangled her, and then sat down
in front of the mirror...

662
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:27,778
...your mirror...

663
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:30,531
...and cut his throat.

664
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,786
What a horrible story.

665
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:41,876
Then the mirror hasn't been
used again until Peter...

666
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:46,130
...until I bought it for my husband.

667
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:48,049
Precisely.

668
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,057
Peter?

669
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,683
Peter?

670
00:48:57,809 --> 00:49:01,646
Peter, darling? Oh, there you are!

671
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:06,859
Something gone wrong
with your plans for a weekend?

672
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:14,617
- Darling, what do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

673
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:18,579
I haven't the faintest idea
what you're talking about.

674
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:21,290
Of course you haven't.

675
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:23,501
You didn't think I suspected anything,

676
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:26,337
when you were so eager
to go away without me.

677
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:29,548
Well, I'm not a fool.
I knew what your game was.

678
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:33,844
Darling, stop, please.
Sit down and listen to me.

679
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,471
I will not sit down!

680
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:38,975
I know you'd like to have me chained
to this chair and chained to this room.

681
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:42,144
But I won't stand it,
not while I've strength to move at all.

682
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:45,106
Darling, sit down and listen to me.
You're not well.

683
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:48,359
And a good thing for you
and your precious lover that I'm not.

684
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:51,654
If I could move out of this room
and break him in pieces...

685
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:56,075
Peter, it's the mirror. I've found out
what's wrong with the mirror.

686
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:03,624
There's nothing wrong with the mirror.
I look in it often.

687
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,918
I sit here and look at these four walls.

688
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:09,839
Then for a change,
I look at them in the mirror.

689
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,721
You don't know what you're saying!

690
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,265
This isn't Marsden Lacy.
Your name isn't Etherington.

691
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:22,184
It's Cortland, Peter Cortland,
and I'm your wife!

692
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:27,106
Exactly, you're my wife,
but you sometimes choose to forget it.

693
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:31,027
Well? What's the matter?
Why have you come back?

694
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:33,362
No, let me guess.

695
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:37,158
You were enjoying a pleasant weekend
with Guy, but he was called away.

696
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:40,036
So you had to come back to me.

697
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:42,747
Peter, I haven't even seen Guy.

698
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,750
Anyhow, you know
we've always treated him as a joke.

699
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:50,087
Yes, I know we've always pretended to,
but I knew what was going on all the time.

700
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:53,466
Nothing's been going on,
you know that as well as I do!

701
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:55,843
I pretended not to notice,

702
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:58,637
day after day,
month after month,

703
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:02,099
while you were making
a public laughing stock of me.

704
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,893
But this time, I've had enough!

705
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:07,855
I'm going to punish you
as you deserve to be punished.

706
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:13,319
It's the mirror. Mr Rutherford told me
about it. That's why I came back.

707
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:17,573
It belonged to a cripple who accused
his wife, just as you're now accusing me.

708
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:20,159
Peter, you must listen to me!

709
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:56,487
Peter.
Peter, darling, are you all right?

710
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:02,827
- I seem to have cut myself.
- Sit down, let me have a look at it.

711
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:07,873
Look at the mirror.
How did that happen?

712
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:10,209
Never mind now, darling.

713
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:15,422
- But, darling, we could get it mended.
- No, we can't.

714
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:18,509
It's old and worm-eaten and rotten.

715
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:21,679
It should've been burned ages ago.

716
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:27,017
You poor darling!

717
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:31,981
Well, I think you could do with a drink
after that. I know I could.

718
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:37,903
Mother, what did you do with that bottle
of schnapps I got for Dr Van Straaten?

719
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:41,115
It's in the cupboard in the hall.

720
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:44,243
Well, how's the great debunker
going to debunk that?

721
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:45,953
Ever since Mr Craig arrived,

722
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,706
you've been asking me to produce
scientific explanations

723
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,749
like rabbits out of a hat.

724
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:53,419
I am not accustomed
to solving complex problems

725
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:55,754
with the careless ease
of your Brains Trust.

726
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:58,299
Sounds to me as though you're
completely stumped this time.

727
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:00,843
Joan saw the room in the mirror
as well as Peter.

728
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:03,512
The witness
I couldn't supply you with.

729
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:05,890
Very well. You asked for it.

730
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:11,020
This was a case of crypto-amnesia.

731
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:16,358
The transmissibility of an illusion by
one person to one or more other persons

732
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:20,529
who are emotionally cohesive,
is well established.

733
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:24,116
- Do I make myself clear?
- I'm totally at sea.

734
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:28,954
You wouldn't like to start again
very slowly, in words of one syllable?

735
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,915
Hamlet was right, Doctor.

736
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,875
There are more things
in heaven and earth

737
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:35,419
than are dreamed of
in your philosophy.

738
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:39,798
And my recurring dream isn't just
a meaningless trick of the mind.

739
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:41,717
It was sent to me as a warning.

740
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:45,095
A warning against the terror
that's waiting for me in this house.

741
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:48,349
Well, I'm like Grainger.
I'm going to act on the warning.

742
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:50,976
I'm going to leave here now,
this instant.

743
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:55,105
Craig, if you go now,
you'll be making a profound mistake.

744
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:58,108
You'll be delivering yourself
into the hands of your obsession.

745
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:00,444
I beg you to stay,
and see it through.

746
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,655
Whatever happens,
if anything happens,

747
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:06,533
the reality can't be possibly be as bad
as your imagination has painted it.

748
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:11,247
Why not? I tell you, Doctor, there's
something horrible awaiting for me here.

749
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:15,000
- Perhaps even death itself.
- Craig!

750
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:18,254
An hour ago, you asked me
to help you. I think I can.

751
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:22,925
But only if you want me to,
only if you do what I beg you to do.

752
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:26,136
While every minute brings
the horror closer? No, Doctor.

753
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,347
I won't submit my will to yours.

754
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:32,101
I'm going to leave this place now,
before it's too late.

755
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:34,853
What's your tipple by the way?
Scotch?

756
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,564
No, thanks, I'm going.
I can't face it.

757
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:40,859
Oh, I'm sorry, my dear fellow.
However, I don't blame you a bit.

758
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:44,947
Oh, yes, you do. You despise me.
You think I'm a contemptible coward.

759
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:47,533
Nothing of the kind, honestly.

760
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:53,247
I'm sorry because a fellow would like
to rally round, lend a helping hand.

761
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:55,874
- Nobody can help me.
- Tell you what, have one for the road.

762
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:59,712
- Well...
- Matter of fact, I know just how you feel.

763
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:03,132
Jolly unpleasant, when you come
slap up against the supernatural.

764
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:06,760
I still get a shiver when I think of what
happened to a couple of friends of mine.

765
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:08,804
Ghastly business.

766
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:13,309
'It was when I was staying
at my golf club at Wittlesham.

767
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:17,062
'The stars of the club were
George Parratt and Larry Potter.

768
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:19,773
'Nothing could keep them
from their game.

769
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:22,860
'They were both pretty good,
and they were deadly rivals,

770
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:24,528
'but only on the links.

771
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:29,533
'In all other respects, they were
the best of friends, until... '

772
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:49,136
'Mary seemed to look on them
with equal favour,

773
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:53,474
'and the result, of course,
was complete deadlock.'

774
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,227
We can't go on like this, old man.
She's ruining my game.

775
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,188
Mine, too.

776
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:02,066
Every time I take a stroke,
I see her wretched face.

777
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:06,945
I keep on hearing her tiresome voice,
just as I'm swinging.

778
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:10,824
- They'll be raising our handicaps soon.
- Yeah...

779
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:12,868
She must choose one of us.

780
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:17,623
But there's nothing to choose.
We're both as good as Bobby Jones.

781
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:21,001
Very nearly.

782
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:27,508
Wish you were dead, old man.

783
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:29,843
It'd be just as good, if you were.

784
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,057
- George, I've got it!
- What?

785
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:37,810
- We'll play for her.
- Tomorrow morning. 18 holes.

786
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:40,062
- Match play.
- Loser to vanish from the scene.

787
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:41,688
- Forever.
- Put it there, old man.

788
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:44,274
Of course!
Why didn't we think of it sooner?

789
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:48,570
'It was a terrific game.
They halved the first four holes.

790
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:51,740
'Then Parratt sliced his drive
and Potter took the lead.

791
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:55,244
'But at the long 13th,
Parratt got a wonderful four,

792
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:58,539
'and after that,
it was ding-dong all the way.

793
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:00,499
'Parratt - Potter. Potter - Parratt.

794
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:04,002

they were square once more.

00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:07,297
'This hole for Mary Lee... '

796
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:22,146
- How many, old man?
- Three.

797
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,398
- And you?
- Two.

798
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:28,652
- Two?
- Yes. Didn't you see my spoon shot?

799
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:32,281
- Oh, beautiful shot, wasn't it, Smithers?
- Ooh, a lovely shot, sir.

800
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:36,785
But nobody's ever reached
this green in two before.

801
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:40,205
- I don't believe it's possible.
- There it is.

802
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:44,585
- No mistake, is there, Smithers?
- No, sir. Quite right, sir. Only 2 strokes.

803
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:49,256
Hmm... Seems as if I've got
my work cut out then.

804
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:02,519
Ho-ho! Jolly good putt, old man.

805
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:05,898
Well, here's for it...

806
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:13,864
Well, that's that!

807
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:20,412
- Grand finish and grand game.
- An almost incredible finish.

808

'With Mary in the bag,

809

his mind once more to serious things.

'He hadn't touched his clubs
since the Potter tragedy,

811
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,834
'and he needed practice.

812
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,211
'I offered to give him a game.

813
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:54,840

he was playing better than ever.

'Life obviously seemed
very good to him.

815

we reached the lake.'

George, old man.

there was only one relief.'

834
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:35,959
Another whiskey, Fred. A large one.

835
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:38,086
Make it two.

836
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:41,423
Heavens!
I thought you were dead.

837
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:44,384
So I am, old man,
as dead as a stymie.

838
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:46,511
- Two large whiskeys, Fred.
- A quadruple, sir?

839
01:02:46,637 --> 01:02:50,724
No, no, no. Separate glasses,
of course. One for him.

840
01:02:52,643 --> 01:02:54,770
Fred can't see me or hear me.

841
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:57,856
Nobody else can either.
It's only you I'm haunting.

842
01:02:57,982 --> 01:03:00,984
Well, it's time you gave
somebody else a turn. I've had it.

843
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:05,864
Not bad, am I, for a beginner?
George Parratt, handicap 18!

844
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:09,117
- I think it's perfectly despicable.
- Not as despicable as cheating at golf.

845
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:11,328
- You haven't a vestige of proof.
- It's on the record.

846
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:13,288
- What record?
- The recording angel's record.

847
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:16,875
- It shows there you took 5 for the 18th.
- Five shillings, please, sir.

848
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:19,920
Recording angel! He can't count.

849
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:26,259
Listen, you're going too far,
it was bad enough on the links.

850
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:30,055
Don't expect me to stop there.
All that invisible stuff was elementary.

851
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:32,933
Any rabbit could do it.
A ghost must better himself.

852
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:35,852
You're going to hang around me
for the rest of my life?

853
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:38,814
I most certainly am.
Unless of course, you care to lay me.

854
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:41,817
- How? -
- First of all, you must give up Mary.

855
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:45,278
Give up Mary? Certainly not!

856
01:03:45,404 --> 01:03:49,115
I'll not have a fine young girl like that
married to a cheat and a liar.

857
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:53,912
I suppose I've got it coming to me.
It'll break my heart of course.

858
01:03:54,038 --> 01:03:58,208
Listen, if you promise to let me alone,
I'll step out of Mary's life.

859
01:03:58,334 --> 01:04:01,503
Well, that's my first condition.
The second is...

860
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:07,759
- You'll have to give up golf.
- Give up golf?

861
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:14,391
- Never!
- Don't you realise what you've done?

862
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:18,311
You've disgraced this club,
besmirched the greatest of all games,

863
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:20,772
dragged the name of St Andrew
in the dust.

864
01:04:20,898 --> 01:04:23,316
Heavens, man, you should be
drummed out of the Royal & Ancient.

865
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:27,153
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I admit all of this.
I'm a cad, a rat and a worm.

866
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,949
I agree with everything you've called me.
But you can't punish me like this.

867
01:04:31,075 --> 01:04:34,202
Listen, Larry,
you're a golfer yourself.

868
01:04:34,328 --> 01:04:36,538
You must realise what it means.

869
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:40,166
I should have nothing left to live for.
Nothing.

870
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:42,878
You can't be such a skunk!

871
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:46,882
Perhaps, you're right, old man.
I mustn't lower myself to your level.

872
01:04:47,008 --> 01:04:50,093
Dear old Larry.
I knew you'd see it the right way.

873
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:53,388
- But you've got to break with Mary.
- And if I do, you'll never haunt me again?

874
01:04:53,514 --> 01:04:57,809
- I'll disappear here and now, forever.
- Ah, it's a deal.

875
01:04:57,935 --> 01:05:00,061
Well, one for the sky.

876
01:05:00,187 --> 01:05:03,064
No, thanks, I've got a date
with St Andrew at four o'clock.

877
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:05,150
Goodbye, old boy.
Good luck. Hope you win.

878
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:07,944
Thanks, George. Goodbye.

879
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:18,496
What's the matter?

880
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:22,042
Got the passes wrong.
I'd better try again.

881
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:39,976
- George...
- Yes?

882
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:46,691
- I've forgotten how to vanish.
- Look here, old man. This is shocking.

883
01:05:46,817 --> 01:05:50,320
I can get as far as this,
then I can't remember what I do next.

884
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:53,198
You must remember. Don't forget
you've been well and truly laid.

885
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:56,326
I know I've got to hold my breath
and do this...

886
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:01,915
- But then I get stuck.
- Well, what about that?

887
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:07,170
No good? Well, try this...

888
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:20,141
No good. No good.
Oh, I am sorry.

889
01:06:20,267 --> 01:06:23,436
It is a bit thick, a ghost shouldn't
be allowed to go haunting

890
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:25,271
until he's properly qualified.

891
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:28,858
It's all my fault. I should've spent
longer on the materialisation course.

892
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:31,152
But you would insist
on getting married on Saturday.

893
01:06:31,278 --> 01:06:33,905
- I still intend to get married on Saturday.
- Oh, but you promised.

894
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:37,158
If you can't keep your side of the bargain,
why should I keep mine?

895
01:06:37,284 --> 01:06:39,452
I see your point.
You realise what it will mean?

896
01:06:39,578 --> 01:06:43,373
- What?
- I'll have to stick to you, everywhere.

897
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:45,709
- Everywhere?
- Yes.

898
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:49,838
Always remain within 6 foot of you.
That's the official ruling.

899
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:52,090
Because a chap becomes a ghost,

900
01:06:52,216 --> 01:06:55,385
it surely doesn't mean that
he ceases to be a gentleman.

901
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:59,931
Don't worry, old chap, it's sure
to come back to me before Saturday.

902
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:44,309
Ha! It was unbelievable!

903
01:07:44,435 --> 01:07:47,145
I was on the green in 2, down in 3.
That's how I collected that one.

904
01:07:47,271 --> 01:07:49,939
- Well, fancy that.
- Now this is the Wackerbath cup.

905
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:53,610
- Yes, dear?
- I beat poor old Larry Potter 7 and 5.

906
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:56,154
2 and 1...
Flukiest game you ever played!

907
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,573
7 and 5!
Oh, I beg your pardon.

908
01:07:58,699 --> 01:08:01,534
Now this one... it's a long story.

909
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:04,954
Darling, you can tell me
all about that tomorrow.

910
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:06,664
Kiss me.

911
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:13,379
- George!
- Yes, my pet?

912
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:16,800
You haven't given me one real kiss
since we left the church!

913
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:20,845
I know, darling, I know.
We've been very busy.

914
01:08:20,971 --> 01:08:24,557
Get on with it. Get on with it, you mug.
That's what you're here for.

915
01:08:24,683 --> 01:08:28,103
Well, we're not busy now, are we?

916
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:46,037
Gracious, ten already!

917
01:08:46,163 --> 01:08:49,332
Is it, darling? I didn't count!

918
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:52,043
Well, I think I'll be turning in, darling.

919
01:08:52,169 --> 01:08:54,879
Yes, I think I'll turn in, too.

920
01:08:55,005 --> 01:08:57,841
I'm feeling rather tired.

921
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:00,009
So am I.

922
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:09,310
- Six feet, old man.
- Six feet!

923
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:14,190
I don't wonder...
I'll just go and count the cups.

924
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:18,027
- Count the cups?
- I always count the cups before bed.

925
01:09:18,612 --> 01:09:21,322
Look here, this is intolerable!

926
01:09:21,448 --> 01:09:24,868
Yes, I quite agree, but what can I do?
Everything's failed.

927
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:27,495
Have another go.
Try as you've never tried before.

928
01:09:27,621 --> 01:09:29,497
All right, for what it's worth.

929
01:09:29,623 --> 01:09:32,167
Shut your eyes.
It'll help you to concentrate.

930
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:34,419
OK, here goes.

931
01:09:41,093 --> 01:09:43,845
Oh, of all the caddish tricks.
I can't think what's come over you.

932
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:46,181
It's entirely your fault.
You can't cheat a ghost.

933
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:48,725
What the devil are we going to do now?

934
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:50,935
I shall have to go on trying, that's all.

935
01:09:51,061 --> 01:09:53,313
Don't you see, you blithering idiot?

936
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:56,357
There may be millions of combinations,
and all you can do is this.

937
01:09:56,483 --> 01:09:58,985
What comes next? Oh!

938
01:09:59,111 --> 01:10:01,988
What are we going to do?
What are we going to do?

939
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:14,542
Good heavens, he's gone.

940
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:17,503
And I wasn't looking.

941
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:21,174
- What's going to happen now?
- Darling!

942
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:27,263
Oh, darling?

943
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:31,935
Do I make passes?

944
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:37,857
Or do I make passes?

945
01:10:43,989 --> 01:10:48,910
Really, Eliot, that story is totally
incredible and decidedly improper.

946
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:52,163
Sorry, I had to tell it.
I couldn't bear to be left out in the cold.

947
01:10:52,289 --> 01:10:55,959
That wasn't why you told the story.
You did it to try and help me.

948
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:59,796
You succeeded, where I failed Eliot.
And in a double sense.

949
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:02,924
Craig, you said
that the horror started

950
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:06,302
when Eliot told about the death
of a man you'd never heard of.

951
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:08,221
- Didn't you?
- That's right.

952
01:11:08,347 --> 01:11:13,434
Well, Eliot just described how
his friend Potter committed suicide.

953
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:16,604
You'd never heard of Potter before,
had you?

954
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:18,147
No, I hadn't.

955
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:22,944
- Yet the horror hasn't started, has it?
- No, it hasn't.

956
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:24,779
There you are, you see.

957
01:11:24,905 --> 01:11:27,532
I'm so glad.
The spell has been broken at last.

958
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:30,702
Now, I can go and see about dinner
with an easy mind.

959
01:11:30,828 --> 01:11:34,372
- I'll lend a hand, if I may?
- Thank you, that's very kind of you.

960
01:11:34,498 --> 01:11:37,834
Oh, Mr Craig,
now that you've met us,

961
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,795
I'm sure you wouldn't dream
of dreaming about us again.

962
01:11:40,921 --> 01:11:43,172
Come along, my dear.

963
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:45,133
Apart from my bit of nonsense,

964
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:47,302
the curious thing is that
all of you, even Sally,

965
01:11:47,428 --> 01:11:49,554
seems to have had one of these
extraordinary experiences.

966
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:52,640
Perhaps they aren't so extraordinary.
Perhaps they happen to most people.

967
01:11:52,766 --> 01:11:56,561
Oh, you mean there's a ghost as well
as a skeleton in everyone's cupboard?

968
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:59,355
- That's a pretty thought.
- What's the ghost in your cupboard?

969
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:01,357
Well...

970
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:06,446
There was one occasion
in my professional career

971
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:08,573
that made me wonder.

972
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:11,284
Made me wonder quite a lot.

973
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:13,453
'You may remember the case.

974
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:16,914
'Maxwell Frere, the ventriloquist,
was charged with the attempted murder

975
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:21,878
'of a man in the same line of business,
Sylvester Kee, an American.

976
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:24,714
'My friend Maurice Olcott,
who was defending the case,

977
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:28,176
'wanted my opinion
on the state of his mind.'

978
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:32,722
Hello, Frere.
This is Dr Van Straaten.

979
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:38,561
- He's going to help us with the case.
- How do you do, Mr Frere?

980
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:41,647
I had the pleasure of seeing your
performance last year at the Hague.

981
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:45,193
- It was most...
- Doctor, eh? A brain specialist?

982
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:47,320
Psychiatrist.

983
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:51,824
I thought as much. You want
to psychoanalyse me, don't you?

984
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:54,786
Want to look inside my brain
and see how the wheels go around.

985
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:58,206
- Now wait a moment, Frere...
- Dissect me like a guinea pig.

986
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:02,251
Then show me off to you distinguished
colleagues as an interesting case.

987
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:04,754
- Well, that's it, isn't it?
- Hardly...

988
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,090
But it's possible that
I may be able to help you

989
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:09,342
if you are prepared to help me.

990
01:13:09,468 --> 01:13:13,221
Now, I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

991
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:16,307
You're wasting your time, Doctor.

992
01:13:16,433 --> 01:13:18,476
I'm not mad.

993
01:13:18,602 --> 01:13:21,270
I don't want your help.
Nor yours, either.

994
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:24,273
- Hugo's the only one who can help me.
- The dummy?

995
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,235
Yes, the police are holding it
as evidence.

996
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:30,071
Hugo should be here with me.

997
01:13:30,197 --> 01:13:34,742
You see... he's more to blame
for all this, than I am.

998
01:13:34,868 --> 01:13:37,578
What exactly do you mean by that?

999
01:13:37,704 --> 01:13:42,417
You'd like to know, wouldn't you?
Get Hugo back, and perhaps you will.

1000
01:13:42,543 --> 01:13:45,461
Perhaps, you'll have a case history that'll
make your complexes stand on end.

1001
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:49,882
Then you can write a big fat book
all about it, eh? Ha-ha!

1002
01:13:50,008 --> 01:13:52,635
Does that tempt you, Doctor?

1003
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:57,682
Very well, then. Get Hugo back!

1004
01:13:59,059 --> 01:14:02,019
Now you see what I'm up against.

1005
01:14:02,146 --> 01:14:04,063
Very interesting.

1006
01:14:04,189 --> 01:14:06,941
I'd like to have a talk
with that other fellow, Kee.

1007
01:14:07,067 --> 01:14:10,319
I'm afraid that's out of the question.
He's a witness for the prosecution.

1008
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:12,405
Look at his statement.
I'd like to know what you think.

1009
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:15,199
Seems more like your job than mine.

1010
01:14:17,828 --> 01:14:20,455
'I knew Maxwell Frere
by reputation

1011
01:14:20,581 --> 01:14:24,709
'as an artiste of the highest standing
in his and my profession.

1012
01:14:26,753 --> 01:14:29,172
'I first made his acquaintance
about a year ago

1013
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:33,009
'when he was performing at
the Chez Beulah Night Club in Paris.'

1014
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:36,179
'Ladies and gentlemen,
is there a Frenchman in the house?

1015
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:37,930
'I am told that one or two
have been seen in Paris lately... '

1016
01:14:38,056 --> 01:14:41,267
- Sylvester Kee!
- Well, hello, Beulah.

1017
01:14:41,393 --> 01:14:43,352
I haven't seen you for years.
Where've you been?

1018
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:46,522
Oh, back in the States.
I just hit town.

1019
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:50,568
- Well, how's business?
- Mighty fine, honey child, mighty fine.

1020
01:14:50,694 --> 01:14:53,279
Hey, you old war horse.
You look terrific.

1021
01:14:53,405 --> 01:14:56,491
Just like the lights of Broadway
on a dark night.

1022
01:14:57,910 --> 01:15:01,579
Say, Beulah, this guy Frere,
they tell me he's pretty good.

1023
01:15:01,705 --> 01:15:04,624
- I'll say he is.
- What's he got that I haven't got?

1024
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:07,376
His dummy.
Don't say you haven't seen him?

1025
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:10,379
Well, what are we waiting for?
Come on, let's go in.

1026
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:13,799
If we had to do this routine in
the Coliseum, the act would be in ruins.

1027
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:18,638
Coliseum? Ruins?
I kill myself sometimes!

1028
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:21,599
Hey, Maxwell, not this one.
Not this one.

1029
01:15:21,725 --> 01:15:24,268
Don't be shy, Hugo,
the lady won't bite you.

1030
01:15:24,394 --> 01:15:27,605
No, but you know me.
I might bite the lady!

1031
01:15:27,731 --> 01:15:32,068
Tell me, my little lotus blossom,
where have I been all your life?

1032
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:33,361
Comment?

1033
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:36,531
Uh-oh, one of the natives.

1034
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:44,539
Didn't I see you working your head off
in the Folies Bergères?

1035
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:47,250
I'm sure I saw her
in the Folies Bergères.

1036
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:49,544
Oh, the lady's face is familiar, is it?

1037
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:53,548
What would I be doing in
the Folies Bergères looking at faces?

1038
01:15:53,674 --> 01:15:55,758
Oh, la-la!

1039
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:59,470
Oh, la-la-la-la-lah!

1040
01:15:59,596 --> 01:16:02,723
Hey, Maxwell, we don't have
to wake these two up.

1041
01:16:02,849 --> 01:16:05,142
Besides, I can read her thoughts.

1042
01:16:05,269 --> 01:16:08,104
Read her thoughts?
Why, Hugo, that's clairvoyance.

1043
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:11,440
Clairvoyance?
Oh, good evening, Claire!

1044
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:14,068
Maxwell, we must be a riot.

1045
01:16:14,194 --> 01:16:16,445
First of tomorrow night's audience
just came in.

1046
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:18,406
See who I mean,
the dumb looking one?

1047
01:16:18,532 --> 01:16:22,451
Why, Hugo, he doesn't look
any more dumb than I do.

1048
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:24,912
Don't ask the impossible!

1049
01:16:26,206 --> 01:16:28,040
Hello, stranger.

1050
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:31,836
One of our American friends,
strong, speechless type.

1051
01:16:31,962 --> 01:16:34,839
Well, Mr Dumb Cluck,
you as dumb as you look,

1052
01:16:34,965 --> 01:16:41,053
or do you cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck,
cock-a-doodle-doo?

1053
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:47,018
- Did you mislay that egg?
- No, Hugo, I didn't do a thing.

1054
01:16:47,144 --> 01:16:49,937
Will someone please tell me
what's going on around here?

1055
01:16:50,063 --> 01:16:53,733
Hugo, I think we'd better move along.
He's a ventriloquist.

1056
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:58,154
- He doesn't look like a trick cyclist.
- No, no, I said ventriloquist.

1057
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:01,240
What, the chap who makes a voice
come out of a stuffed dummy?

1058
01:17:01,366 --> 01:17:04,035
- The way I do out of you?
- That's about it.

1059
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:08,914
Well, well, well...
Is it true what he said?

1060
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:11,667
- I guess so.
- You interest me, my man.

1061
01:17:11,793 --> 01:17:14,337
You interest me quite a lot.

1062
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:17,965
We two could make
beautiful music together.

1063
01:17:18,091 --> 01:17:23,054
That's fine, Hugo, but how about making
a little music with Frank, eh? Frank!

1064
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:38,861
Maxwell,
I don't think I feel like singing.

1065
01:17:38,987 --> 01:17:41,405
Come, come, Hugo.
Mustn't disappoint your public.

1066
01:17:41,531 --> 01:17:45,951
Just a bird in a gilded cage, that's me.
Oh, to hell with it!

1067
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:49,163
Oh, come on, now.
Are you ready? One, two, three.

1068
01:17:49,289 --> 01:17:53,084
Four, five, six!
Let's sit this one out, shall we?

1069
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:58,464
- Hugo, everybody's waiting.
- My, my, so they are.

1070
01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:00,925
Tell you what,
you be the canary tonight.

1071
01:18:01,051 --> 01:18:05,054
I'm going to talk to the ventriloquist.
Mind if I join you?

1072
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:06,972
Sure, come on over.

1073
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:09,433
Come on, sour puss.

1074
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:14,355
Sit down.

1075
01:18:14,481 --> 01:18:18,859
Now, either of you gentlemen
care for a glass of champagne?

1076
01:18:18,985 --> 01:18:21,821
What do you think I am,
a battleship?

1077
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:25,241
Do you know something? I like you.
What's your name?

1078
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:27,660
The name is Kee, Sylvester Kee.

1079
01:18:27,786 --> 01:18:31,706
- Sylvester, you may call me Hugo.
- Oh, thanks, Hugo.

1080
01:18:31,832 --> 01:18:35,835
- That is my assistant.
- Oh, glad to know you, Mr Frere.

1081
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:38,462
A very uncouth character, I'm afraid.

1082
01:18:38,588 --> 01:18:42,133
I say, Sylvester,
how'd you like to work with me?

1083
01:18:42,259 --> 01:18:45,177
I'd like it fine, Hugo, but...

1084
01:18:45,303 --> 01:18:48,472
- But what?
- Well, how about Mr Frere?

1085
01:18:48,598 --> 01:18:50,683
You're sort of teamed up with him,
aren't you?

1086
01:18:50,809 --> 01:18:54,061
Him?
My good man, think nothing of it.

1087
01:18:54,187 --> 01:18:57,398
I'm just about through
with that cheap ham, anyway.

1088
01:18:57,524 --> 01:18:59,775
Ooh!

1089
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:03,320
Temper, temper.
You'll be sorry for this later, you know.

1090
01:19:04,322 --> 01:19:06,657
Yes, I suppose I will.

1091
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:11,704

1093

Exactly. But every now and then,
we have our little disagreements.

1094
01:19:18,545 --> 01:19:21,380
You certainly disagree with me.

1095
01:19:21,506 --> 01:19:25,050
Would you believe it?
This guy thinks he carries the act.

1096
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:27,386
Well, in one way, maybe he does.

1097
01:19:27,512 --> 01:19:29,513
Come, come, Hugo,
we must be going.

1098
01:19:29,639 --> 01:19:32,683
Sure, sure. But there won't be
much room in the dressing room.

1099
01:19:32,809 --> 01:19:34,560
Not much room? Why not?

1100
01:19:34,686 --> 01:19:39,148
I told the waiter to bring up two side-cars
and he brought two motorcycles as well!

- You want to see me?
- Well, er...

1128
01:21:35,765 --> 01:21:39,518
I rather thought I had an invite
from our young friend here.

1129
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:43,647
After all, Mr Frere,
I'm a ventriloquist myself, you know...

1130
01:21:43,773 --> 01:21:45,357
Hell, I'm soaking.

1131
01:21:47,152 --> 01:21:50,112
- There's a clean towel in here.
- Thanks.

1132
01:21:52,324 --> 01:21:54,992
Sorry, but I can't bear
anyone touching him.

1133
01:21:55,118 --> 01:21:58,037
Oh, that's all right. Forget it.

1134
01:21:58,163 --> 01:22:01,248
Say, I sure liked it
how you pulled that gag.

1135
01:22:01,374 --> 01:22:03,584
What gag?
I don't quite follow you.

1136
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:05,461
The one I saw before you came in.

1137
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:08,213
For a moment, I could've sworn
it was the dummy speaking.

1138
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:10,382
And me a pro.

1139
01:22:11,509 --> 01:22:14,553
- What did he say?
- No, don't let's start that all over again.

1140
01:22:14,679 --> 01:22:18,098
- About you and him?
- Yes, but you know that.

1141
01:22:18,224 --> 01:22:19,642
You wouldn't...

1142
01:22:21,186 --> 01:22:24,813
- You wouldn't ever do that, would you?
- Do what? I don't get you.

1143
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:28,108
- Do what he was asking.
- Say, are you nuts or something?

1144
01:22:28,234 --> 01:22:31,862
How in heck could I team up
with Hugo? He's yours, isn't he?

1145
01:22:31,988 --> 01:22:33,906
Yes, that's right, he's mine.

1146
01:22:34,032 --> 01:22:37,618
What kind of heel do you think I am
that I'd try to steal another guy's act?

1147
01:22:37,744 --> 01:22:40,663
Please don't misunderstand me.
I don't distrust you.

1148
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:44,083
- You don't know what Hugo's capable of.
- Oh, I don't know about that,

1149
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:46,585
I've had a pretty good demonstration.

1150
01:22:46,711 --> 01:22:50,005
Say, who runs this act anyway?
This fellow's almost human.

1151
01:22:50,131 --> 01:22:52,299
- Did you say "almost"?
- That's right.

1152
01:22:52,425 --> 01:22:54,259
As if you've got a mind of your own.

1153
01:22:54,386 --> 01:22:57,888
Maxwell, this fellow is as stupid
as you are.

1154
01:22:58,014 --> 01:23:02,726
- Perhaps, I better explain my position.
- No, no, no.

1155
01:23:02,852 --> 01:23:06,855
Kee, if you don't mind...
I'm rather tired.

1156
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:09,984
Why, sure, I understand.

1157
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:13,195
Ignore him, Sylvester.
Just ignore him.

- Listen, my friend...
- No! No!

Say, what kind of a routine is this,
anyway?

1162

01:24:47,248 --> 01:24:49,541
I expect he is.
We walked out of his show.

1183
01:24:49,667 --> 01:24:51,752
Oh? How come?

1184
01:24:51,878 --> 01:24:54,755
He didn't like it,
and I don't want to talk about it.

1185
01:24:54,881 --> 01:24:57,758
- Jack, same again.
- OK by me, brother.

1186
01:24:59,135 --> 01:25:00,469
Scotch, please.

1187
01:25:00,595 --> 01:25:03,055
Come on, you two.
We only got five minutes.

1188
01:25:03,181 --> 01:25:05,390
Evening, Jack.
What are you going to have, girls?

1189
01:25:05,517 --> 01:25:07,184
- Whiskey sour.
- Me, too.

1190
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:09,394
- Three whiskey sours, Jack.
- Oh, look!

1191
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:13,440
- There's Maxwell Frere the ventriloquist.
- Never seen him. Is that his dummy?

1192
01:25:13,566 --> 01:25:16,026
Yes, Hugo Fitch. Isn't he quaint?

1193
01:25:16,152 --> 01:25:18,362
Oh, I'd just love to pick him up.

1194
01:25:18,488 --> 01:25:20,697
Oh, you can't, Mitzi,
the man's plastered.

1195
01:25:20,824 --> 01:25:23,909
You know very well
I mean the dummy. You're awful!

1196
01:25:24,035 --> 01:25:28,747
- Go ahead, then, why don't you?
- Go on, don't be shy.

1197
01:25:30,166 --> 01:25:31,792
Very well, then.

1198
01:25:31,918 --> 01:25:36,922
Oh, Mr Frere, I hope you wouldn't mind,
but he looks so cute.

1199
01:25:37,048 --> 01:25:41,718
- On your way, sister. On your way!
- Aren't you a little devil?

1200
01:25:41,845 --> 01:25:43,637
Come along now.

1201
01:25:43,763 --> 01:25:47,057
Take your hands off me,
or I'll punch your little face in.

1202
01:25:47,183 --> 01:25:50,394
Maxwell, this cheap bit of skirt's
getting after me.

1203
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:53,981
You low, filthy drunk, you. I'll...

1204
01:25:54,691 --> 01:25:57,943
- Did you hear what this man called me?
- Oh, skip it. Have a drink.

1205
01:25:58,069 --> 01:26:03,448
Harry Parker, are you going to stand by
and let this creature insult me?

1206
01:26:04,617 --> 01:26:06,285
All right...

1207
01:26:08,454 --> 01:26:11,623
Look here, old man,
you'd better apologise to this lady.

1208
01:26:11,749 --> 01:26:14,501
- What did you say?
- I said you've insulted this lady.

1209
01:26:14,627 --> 01:26:17,713
And I said you'd better
apologise to her.

1210
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:21,300
I assure you,
I hadn't the slightest intention...

1211
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:26,138
Lady? Ha-ha! What lady?
Maxwell, I don't see no lady.

1212
01:26:26,264 --> 01:26:29,516
Are you going to apologise
like a gentleman?

1213
01:26:29,642 --> 01:26:33,770
- Or do I have to make you?
- Who does this guy think he is?

1214
01:26:33,897 --> 01:26:37,191
Will you kick his teeth in, Maxwell,
or shall I?

1215
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:42,654
- You asked for it.
- Gentlemen, no fighting!

1216
01:26:44,908 --> 01:26:48,493
Cut it out.
Cut it out, the guy's stinking.

1217
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:52,831
- What's it got to do with you?
- I said cut it out. Go on, scram.

1218
01:26:52,957 --> 01:26:55,042
All right,
no need to get tough about it.

1219
01:26:55,168 --> 01:26:57,377
- You all right, Frere?
- Hugo?

1220
01:26:57,503 --> 01:26:59,421
Come on, girls.
Drink up, let's get out of here.

1221
01:26:59,547 --> 01:27:02,758
- Come on, it's past time!
- All right, all right...

1222
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:04,885
- Here he is.
- Thank you.

1223
01:27:05,011 --> 01:27:07,346
Well, it's my old friend Sylvester!

1224
01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:09,181
A-ha, that's better.

1225
01:27:09,307 --> 01:27:11,767
- You shouldn't have done that.
- Just one of those things.

1226
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:15,437
- Are you staying in the hotel?
- Room 791.

1227
01:27:15,563 --> 01:27:18,732
- We're all right.
- Sure you are. Sure you are.

1228
01:27:18,858 --> 01:27:23,779
I'm just going up to my room,
and I'll see you home. 791...

1229
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:28,367
I tell you,
it can't go on much longer.

1230
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:32,913
He's doing it deliberately,
all this business with Joe Green...

1231
01:27:33,039 --> 01:27:36,708
- He's trying to ruin me.
- Oh, Joe wouldn't do a thing like that.

1232
01:27:36,834 --> 01:27:39,169
- He's sore, but...
- Joe?

1233
01:27:39,295 --> 01:27:43,215
You thought I meant?
That's good.

1234
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:47,928
That's really funny.

1235
01:27:49,847 --> 01:27:53,267
- No, I didn't mean Joe.
- I don't get it.

1236
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:56,770
Don't you?
No, I suppose you wouldn't.

1237
01:27:56,896 --> 01:27:58,897
You just think I'm drunk, don't you?

1238
01:27:59,023 --> 01:28:01,483
You're not acting
like you're on the water wagon.

1239
01:28:01,609 --> 01:28:03,819
Smug, aren't you?

1240
01:28:03,945 --> 01:28:07,698
Well, you'd drink too,
if you were in my shoes.

1241
01:28:08,908 --> 01:28:13,829
I tell you... it's enough
to drive a man mad.

1242
01:28:15,248 --> 01:28:18,667
Why don't you grab yourself
some sleep?

1243
01:28:18,793 --> 01:28:22,421
What do you care
whether I sleep or not?

1244
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:29,428
I'm not such a fool as you think,
Sylvester Kee.

1245
01:28:29,554 --> 01:28:34,182
I remember what happened in Paris.
I know what you're after.

1246
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:37,728
- You won't get away with it.
- You're crazy.

1247
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,234
Get out of this room.

1248
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:49,197
Go on! Get out of this hotel, before I send
for the manager and get you thrown out.

1249
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:52,534
Now, take it easy, pal.
It happens that I'm living in the hotel.

1250
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:55,704
- Thrown out!
- Take it easy. Take it easy.

1251
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:58,915
You think you're mighty clever,
don't you?

1252
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:01,251
I'll get even with you.

1253
01:29:01,377 --> 01:29:05,380
I'll be ready for you.
You won't get away with it.

1254
01:29:09,385 --> 01:29:14,765
Young fella, if my pal Fancy Pants
got me down the way you do your boss,

1255
01:29:14,891 --> 01:29:18,143
well, I guess I'd want to be rid of him.

1256
01:29:39,707 --> 01:29:41,291
OK, OK...

1257
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:48,048
- Where is he?
- Huh? Where's who?

1258
01:29:48,174 --> 01:29:52,260
- What are you talking about?
- Where is he? You've stolen him.

1259
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:55,180
If you're talking about the dummy,
I left him on your bed.

1260
01:29:55,306 --> 01:29:59,893
- Now go away and let me sleep?
- He's here. I know he's here.

1261
01:30:00,019 --> 01:30:04,648
Hey, will you get the hell out of here
or do I have to throw you out?

1262
01:30:12,281 --> 01:30:14,908
No. No. Wait...

1263
01:30:15,993 --> 01:30:18,662
Dirty, thieving swine.

1264
01:30:22,708 --> 01:30:25,001
You dirty, thieving swine!

1265
01:30:31,843 --> 01:30:35,804
- What do you think of it?
- Well, before I commit myself...

1266
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:37,973
...I must talk to Frere again.

1267
01:30:38,099 --> 01:30:40,267
Think you'll be able to get
anything out of him?

1268
01:30:40,393 --> 01:30:43,228
- That, my friend, depends on you.
- On me?

1269
01:30:43,354 --> 01:30:46,606
On your powers of persuasion
with the police, I should say.

1270
01:30:46,732 --> 01:30:50,318
As a matter of fact, I don't expect
to get what I want from Maxwell Frere.

1271
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:52,279
Who do you expect to get it from?

1272
01:30:52,405 --> 01:30:55,699
If I am on the right lines,
from Hugo Fitch.

1273
01:30:55,825 --> 01:30:57,826
Hugo Fitch?

1274
01:32:07,146 --> 01:32:10,273
I knew you wouldn't leave me, Hugo.

1275
01:32:10,399 --> 01:32:15,195
- I knew you'd come back.
- Not for long, my boy, not for long.

1276
01:32:15,321 --> 01:32:19,616
You're going to stop in jail for years
and years and years and years.

1277
01:32:19,742 --> 01:32:21,660
That wouldn't suit me.

1278
01:32:21,786 --> 01:32:26,122
But you'll tell them the truth.
You'll tell them it wasn't my fault.

1279
01:32:26,249 --> 01:32:29,793
What sort of dummy do you think I am?
You shot him, didn't you?

1280
01:32:29,919 --> 01:32:32,003
Yes, but that was in self-defence.

1281
01:32:32,129 --> 01:32:34,923
- He was trying to rob me.
- Tell that to the judge.

1282
01:32:35,049 --> 01:32:38,927
Poor Sylvester!
Such a charming fellow.

1283
01:32:39,053 --> 01:32:42,806
They tell me he's recovering,
be out of hospital soon.

1284
01:32:43,933 --> 01:32:49,187
- What's that to you?
- Looks like I'll be needing a new partner.

1285
01:32:49,313 --> 01:32:53,900
Hugo!
You don't mean that. You're joking.

1286
01:32:54,026 --> 01:32:57,445
Like hell I am.
I've my career to think of.

1287
01:32:57,572 --> 01:33:00,198
What?
You wouldn't run out on me now?

1288
01:33:00,324 --> 01:33:04,077
I don't believe it.
You wouldn't do that to me.

1289
01:33:04,203 --> 01:33:07,747
Oh, wouldn't I? Wouldn't I?

1290
01:33:07,873 --> 01:33:09,833
Wouldn't I?

1291
01:33:09,959 --> 01:33:12,460
Hugo, I wouldn't let you.

1292
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:17,424
Can't stop me, Maxwell.
You're finished. Finished.

1293
01:33:18,301 --> 01:33:22,429
But if I tell them the truth...
if I tell them you made me do it?

1294
01:33:22,555 --> 01:33:26,683
Try it and see what happens.
They'll put you in the madhouse.

1295
01:33:26,809 --> 01:33:29,853
But not little Hugo. Oh, no.

1296
01:33:29,979 --> 01:33:34,190
I'm going to team up with Sylvester.
Maybe we'll come and visit you.

1297
01:33:34,317 --> 01:33:37,944
You know,
private show for the looneys.

1298
01:33:41,907 --> 01:33:45,660
Now, Maxwell, don't get excited.
I was only joking.

1299
01:33:45,786 --> 01:33:48,788
You know me.
Maxwell!

1300
01:33:50,791 --> 01:33:53,543
Maxwell, you can't kill me!

1301
01:33:53,669 --> 01:33:56,087
Stop, Frere!

1302
01:33:59,467 --> 01:34:00,800
Frere, you fool!

1303
01:34:02,303 --> 01:34:04,512
Officer! Quickly, open this door!

1304
01:34:06,015 --> 01:34:07,724
Quickly!

1305
01:34:23,407 --> 01:34:25,575
I hope we're doing the right thing.

1306
01:34:26,661 --> 01:34:29,162
You know what happened
the last time we met.

1307
01:34:29,288 --> 01:34:31,790
Maybe, he won't feel so good
seeing me again.

1308
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:34,376
It's our responsibility, Mr Kee.

1309
01:34:34,502 --> 01:34:37,754
- He's in here.
- Just a minute, Doc.

1310
01:34:39,590 --> 01:34:42,342
I guess I got the jitters.

1311
01:34:42,468 --> 01:34:44,886
It'll give him a hell of a jolt,
won't it?

1312
01:34:45,012 --> 01:34:49,474
That's just it. He needs a jolt
to set his brain working again.

1313
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:53,728
You're the jolt. Of course, it's risky,
but it's our only hope.

1314
01:34:53,854 --> 01:34:57,148
- Well, I...
- We are ready to chance it, if you are.

1315
01:34:57,274 --> 01:35:00,735
- OK. You're the doctors.
- Thanks.

1316
01:35:11,622 --> 01:35:13,998
He's been like that all the time.

1317
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:17,752
Frere,
there's someone to see you.

1318
01:35:24,176 --> 01:35:27,387
Hello, there.
How are you keeping?

1319
01:35:39,316 --> 01:35:43,903
Say, you remember me.
The name is Kee, Sylvester Kee.

1320
01:36:05,968 --> 01:36:09,304
Why, hello, Sylvester.

1321
01:36:09,430 --> 01:36:12,056
I've been waiting for you.

1322
01:36:16,270 --> 01:36:18,980
'I've been waiting for you.'

1323
01:36:28,991 --> 01:36:30,742
He's still there.

1324
01:36:30,868 --> 01:36:33,828
One of the most complete examples
of dual identity

1325
01:36:33,954 --> 01:36:36,831
in the history of medical science.

1326
01:36:36,957 --> 01:36:39,334
You mean that half the time
Frere was Frere

1327
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:41,085
and the other half
he was his dummy?

1328
01:36:41,212 --> 01:36:42,670
Exactly.

1329
01:36:42,797 --> 01:36:45,590
And in the end, the dummy got
the upper hand entirely.

1330
01:36:45,716 --> 01:36:50,303
But how did the dummy get from one
room to another? Under its own steam?

1331
01:36:50,429 --> 01:36:54,808
Without knowing what he was doing,
Frere took it himself.

1332
01:36:54,934 --> 01:36:58,520
Impelled by the dominating
Hugo half of his mind.

1333
01:36:58,646 --> 01:37:01,606
That is the scientific explanation.

1334
01:37:01,732 --> 01:37:05,443
But, no doubt, you people would
prefer a more colourful one.

1335
01:37:05,569 --> 01:37:09,489
That Hugo had become endowed
with an existence of his own.

1336
01:37:09,615 --> 01:37:13,660
Drink? Oh, I'm awfully sorry.

1337
01:37:20,918 --> 01:37:22,919
Blimey, George is dying on us.

1338
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:26,881
It's... started.

1339
01:37:28,342 --> 01:37:31,886
It's all right.
Nothing's started. No one's dying.

1340
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:35,306
George isn't a man,
it's Foley's power plant.

1341
01:37:35,432 --> 01:37:38,643
They make their own electricity.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

1342
01:37:38,769 --> 01:37:41,312
- We're your friends.
- We want to help you.

1343
01:37:41,438 --> 01:37:43,189
None of you can help me.

1344
01:37:43,315 --> 01:37:47,360
I must be left alone
with Dr Van Straaten. Please.

1345
01:37:48,988 --> 01:37:50,697
Perhaps that's best.

1346
01:37:50,823 --> 01:37:53,783
Grainger, would you be kind enough
to fetch my spare glasses from my room?

1347
01:37:53,909 --> 01:37:56,786
- I'm lost without them.
- Yes. OK, Doctor.

1348
01:37:57,872 --> 01:38:02,750
And now, Craig...
I accept your dream.

1349
01:38:04,378 --> 01:38:07,630
Now my task is to listen
and yours to talk.

1350
01:38:07,756 --> 01:38:11,759
Just let your thoughts run on.
Speak them aloud.

1351
01:38:11,886 --> 01:38:14,721
Say everything that is in your mind.

1352
01:38:20,185 --> 01:38:23,396
If only I'd left here
when I wanted to,

1353
01:38:23,522 --> 01:38:26,482
when I still had a will of my own.

1354
01:38:27,318 --> 01:38:31,613
You tried to stop me.
You wouldn't have done if you'd known.

1355
01:38:31,739 --> 01:38:37,243
You have not told me yet what it is
that you are compelled to do, Craig.

1356
01:38:37,369 --> 01:38:42,582
To kill someone, someone
who's never done me any harm.

1357
01:38:42,708 --> 01:38:45,585
Who wishes me nothing but good.

1358
01:38:45,711 --> 01:38:47,921
A man without defence,

1359
01:38:48,047 --> 01:38:50,757
because he's lost in the dark.

1360
01:38:50,883 --> 01:38:55,929
Oh, Doctor... why did you
have to break your glasses?

1361
01:39:07,524 --> 01:39:09,817
'Got to hide. Hide.'

1362
01:39:14,031 --> 01:39:16,950
Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop!

1363
01:39:18,452 --> 01:39:20,912
- Let's play another game.
- Yes, hide-and-seek.

1364
01:39:21,038 --> 01:39:23,414
- Who's to hide?
- I'll hide, I'll hide.

1365
01:39:23,540 --> 01:39:27,293
Yes, Mr Craig'll hide! Mr Craig'll hide!

1366
01:39:27,419 --> 01:39:31,214
One, two, three, four, five, six...

1367
01:39:33,884 --> 01:39:36,386
- Peter!
- Something gone wrong with your plans?

1368
01:39:36,512 --> 01:39:39,931
- Please, Peter, let me hide
in the room in the mirror.

1369
01:39:40,057 --> 01:39:42,225
Room in the mirror?

1370
01:39:42,351 --> 01:39:46,646
...thirty, forty, fifty, sixty,
seventy, eighty, ninety, hundred!

1371
01:39:50,526 --> 01:39:52,318
Jimmy, I've got him!

1372
01:39:57,074 --> 01:39:59,867
Here he is, up in the lumber room,
up in the lumber room!

1373
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:05,873
Take a seat, sucker.
What's biting you, sucker?

1374
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,209
He looks kind of sick to me, Hugo.

1375
01:40:08,335 --> 01:40:11,921
- Well, why don't he see a doctor?
- Maybe he has seen a doctor.

1376
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:17,427
My, my, Hugo, we've never played
to a murderer before, have we?

1377
01:40:17,553 --> 01:40:20,638
Why, no, Kee.
Is there a policeman in the house?

1378
01:40:32,943 --> 01:40:35,361
Just room for one more inside, sir.

1379
01:40:35,487 --> 01:40:38,281
No! No! No!

1380
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:06,059
Wouldn't I?

1381
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:24,285
Darling, whatever's the matter?

1382
01:41:26,038 --> 01:41:29,123
- Another nightmare.
- You poor sweet.

1383
01:41:29,249 --> 01:41:30,666
Hello?

1384
01:41:30,793 --> 01:41:33,419
Oh, just a minute.
Darling...

1385
01:41:35,255 --> 01:41:37,006
Walter Craig speaking.

1386
01:41:37,132 --> 01:41:39,342
Darling, you're on my feet.

1387
01:41:40,803 --> 01:41:43,763
Oh? Bill put you on to me?

1388
01:41:45,057 --> 01:41:46,808
That's fine.

1389
01:41:48,477 --> 01:41:50,853
- What name is it?
- Eliot Foley.

1390
01:41:50,979 --> 01:41:54,273
F-O-L-E-Y.

1391
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:58,528
- Yes, and the place is Pilgrim's Farm.
- Right.

1392
01:41:58,654 --> 01:42:00,530
- Who was it?
- A friend of Bill's.

1393
01:42:00,656 --> 01:42:03,324
Wants me to go down for the weekend.
A reconstruction job.

1394
01:42:03,450 --> 01:42:05,743
An old farmhouse in Kent.

1395
01:42:07,287 --> 01:42:10,623
Eliot Foley... Pilgrim's Farm...

1396
01:42:11,792 --> 01:42:14,043
I wonder why that sounds so familiar.

1397
01:42:14,169 --> 01:42:17,296
A weekend in the country?
I should go.

1398
01:42:17,422 --> 01:42:21,300
I'll toss for it.
Heads I go. Tails I don't.

1399
01:42:22,511 --> 01:42:24,512
- Heads.
- I go.

1400
01:42:24,638 --> 01:42:26,889
That's just what you need, darling.

1401
01:42:27,015 --> 01:42:30,434
It'll help you get rid
of those horrible nightmares.

1401
01:42:31,305 --> 01:42:37,481
