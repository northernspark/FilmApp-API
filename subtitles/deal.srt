Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

2
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,578
I'm in.

3
00:01:49,545 --> 00:01:52,611
Alright ladies, twenty dollars.

4
00:01:54,148 --> 00:01:58,862
What ya got Phil, are you in or not?
- I'm out.

5
00:02:00,785 --> 00:02:02,814
Let me guess.
Raise?

6
00:02:05,312 --> 00:02:08,760
Well, I wasn't going to, but now that you put
the idea in my head, sure, why not?

7
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,944
I've seen that look before. I'm out.

8
00:02:13,636 --> 00:02:17,269
You don't wanna do that?
- I think you're bluffin'.

9
00:02:17,434 --> 00:02:19,158
That's an awful lot.
- Could be.

10
00:02:19,314 --> 00:02:21,672
It could also be that the cards in my hand
plus the cards already showing

11
00:02:21,673 --> 00:02:23,908
give me an 86 percent chance of winning.

12
00:02:24,071 --> 00:02:26,526
You know what, Tory,
you've got a 14 percent window to lose.

13
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,555
You're so full of shit.
- Am I?

14
00:02:28,713 --> 00:02:31,659
This is so much fun, gentlemen. I fold.
- So what's next?

15
00:02:34,313 --> 00:02:36,146
Shit, I didn't even need it.

16
00:02:39,262 --> 00:02:41,138
Every single time.

17
00:02:43,175 --> 00:02:45,739
One more round?
- I gotta go.

18
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,736
This sucks.
- What sucks?

19
00:02:48,891 --> 00:02:53,680
This!
College is half over, no fun.

20
00:02:56,487 --> 00:02:58,778
Alex's room.
- I'm not here, Buddy.

21
00:02:59,862 --> 00:03:01,924
No, this is Ben, who's this?

22
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,423
Yeah, just a second.
Dude, it's Melissa.

23
00:03:05,424 --> 00:03:08,424
What?
She says she's calling you back for like two weeks going.

24
00:03:09,036 --> 00:03:11,401
I can't talk now.
Tell her I'm not there.

25
00:03:11,563 --> 00:03:13,879
You can't? You've got the biggest
crush on this girl for the past six months.

26
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,585
You're gonna talk to her now.

27
00:03:14,586 --> 00:03:15,586
Melissa, Hi.

28
00:03:17,662 --> 00:03:21,688
No, I'm in the middle of something right now.
Can I call you back?... Right.

29
00:03:25,527 --> 00:03:29,279
Who are you?
- I know.

30
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,833
What happens if he wins?

31
00:03:31,834 --> 00:03:34,267
- Alex plays in a Poker
Stars tournament on TV.

32
00:03:34,427 --> 00:03:37,449
What if he doesn't?
- He's making photocopies for a law firm.

33
00:03:37,611 --> 00:03:39,825
Guys please, I've been up all night.

34
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:42,629
What do you need?
- A pair of ladies.

35
00:03:56,792 --> 00:03:58,210
Hey, guys.

36
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,816
We're so proud of you.
- Definitely.

37
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,840
Magna cum laude, not bad.

38
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:08,481
But suma cum laude would have landed you
a full scholarship for law school.

39
00:04:09,604 --> 00:04:12,441
Hello everyone, Mr. and Mrs. S.
- Hi, Ben.

40
00:04:12,597 --> 00:04:14,855
How are you, son?

41
00:04:15,014 --> 00:04:18,155
Where are all the girls wanted it?

42
00:04:18,313 --> 00:04:20,375
Open your eyes kid.

43
00:04:20,538 --> 00:04:22,872
You've haven't said anything?
- No.

44
00:04:23,031 --> 00:04:24,405
Said what about what?

45
00:04:26,906 --> 00:04:27,906
Alex?

46
00:04:28,862 --> 00:04:31,426
I put in for a tournament.
- Sweet!

47
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:36,488
I got him.
- It's only for a couple days.

48
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:40,174
You promised it was just a hobby.
- It won't get out of hand.

49
00:04:41,176 --> 00:04:45,235
'Get out of hand'.
Come on, I beat out hundreds of people.

50
00:04:45,396 --> 00:04:48,996
I stuck my neck out to get you that job.
- And I'll still be there.

51
00:04:50,307 --> 00:04:51,987
This is a big deal.

52
00:04:57,595 --> 00:05:01,196
Thanks for being here with us at PokerStars.com,
a ten million dollar

53
00:05:01,355 --> 00:05:05,381
I'm Greg 'Fossilman' Raymer
and working with me is Joseph Hachem.

54
00:05:05,536 --> 00:05:09,824
So Greg, what've you got today?
- Well Joe, in case any of our players don't show up today...

55
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,783
I'm ready to jump in anytime they want.

56
00:05:17,237 --> 00:05:19,375
These are our players.

57
00:05:19,538 --> 00:05:23,674
Antonio 'Magician' Esfandiara.
The 'Unabomber' Phil Laak.

58
00:05:24,679 --> 00:05:29,817
Tex Button, and of course the
very famous, Karen 'Razor' Jones.

59
00:05:30,817 --> 00:05:34,188
Do you want a drink?
- No, no, I'm fine.

60
00:05:34,346 --> 00:05:37,292
We will see if
to our newcomers.

61
00:05:39,141 --> 00:05:41,094
You want to give me a hand in here?

62
00:05:41,251 --> 00:05:44,699
Player's on third,
be right in.

63
00:05:54,294 --> 00:05:59,313
Each player first are dealt two down cards.
And then they bet a round.

64
00:05:59,473 --> 00:06:04,416
Then come the community
cards with the flop, the turn, and the river.

65
00:06:04,575 --> 00:06:09,486
In the end the best five card combination
wins the hand and takes the pot.

66
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:11,897
Let's take a closer look at
one of their newest challengers.

67
00:06:11,898 --> 00:06:13,970
I guess you could say I've
always been good with numbers.

68
00:06:14,127 --> 00:06:17,848
Note that Alex Stillman, just 21 years old,
born and raised in Los Angeles,

69
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:20,719
learned to play poker
in just the last three years.

70
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:23,184
And when this whiz kid went
off to college in the east,

71
00:06:23,185 --> 00:06:25,942
he realized that there might be a
little bit more to his poker hand.

72
00:06:30,086 --> 00:06:32,803
Good luck all.

73
00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:37,373
4,000.
You have to bet, Karen?

74
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:43,240
Too steep for me.
- Alex, who had by far the most chips...

75
00:06:43,398 --> 00:06:46,038
but he has already lost the most
since the start of play.

76
00:06:47,924 --> 00:06:49,605
Let but see then.

77
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,412
Have fun.
- Looks like I've scared everyone out.

78
00:07:20,033 --> 00:07:21,714
10,000.

79
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:25,355
He may run into problems.
- Not really.

80
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:30,691
If you don't know how well the cards
of Razor, it's top pair.

81
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:33,535
He likes his hand.
Alright, I call.

82
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,338
It's all up to you.

83
00:07:36,184 --> 00:07:39,173
Ten of clubs.
Interesting.

84
00:07:40,173 --> 00:07:43,577
I'm all in.
- Should you see.

85
00:07:43,741 --> 00:07:46,478
Hey, you're gonna wish
you'd paid more attention.

86
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:47,189
I tripped up

87
00:07:47,731 --> 00:07:50,186
Razor keeps pace.
Once see what the river.

88
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:53,285
I think Alex
will be very disappointed.

89
00:07:55,556 --> 00:07:57,738
Thus feels zero percent now.

90
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,302
You didn't get a card when you needed it,
but you were already reports.

91
00:08:05,722 --> 00:08:08,635
See you around.
Go back to school.

92
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:11,279
He was lucky that he came extent.

93
00:08:11,438 --> 00:08:15,235
Hopefully he learned
for the next time.

94
00:08:29,277 --> 00:08:33,150
Alex, when you get a moment, I need you to get
Mr. Wallace the briefs for the Longhorn case.

95
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:34,458
By the way, today is pay day,

96
00:08:34,459 --> 00:08:37,560
but they don't give you your first check
until the end of the next pay period.

97
00:08:37,716 --> 00:08:41,590
Do you think you can make it two more weeks?
- I think I can manage.

98
00:08:41,591 --> 00:08:42,591
OK, Good.
- OK

99
00:08:44,736 --> 00:08:49,755
Oh, and Alex, be careful. That sorter
is almost at capacity.

100
00:09:03,956 --> 00:09:05,636
Find anything better?

101
00:09:08,598 --> 00:09:11,161
There's one cruise left
that leaves in July.

102
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:16,959
We can afford a third class cabin,
but that's about it.

103
00:09:17,344 --> 00:09:19,449
We do get a lobster night right now

104
00:09:19,607 --> 00:09:23,088
Really, lobster.

105
00:09:25,093 --> 00:09:27,384
Why don't we go first class?

106
00:09:28,239 --> 00:09:30,650
Oh, come on.

107
00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:32,303
Honey,

108
00:09:34,454 --> 00:09:35,834
what's the matter?

109
00:09:35,835 --> 00:09:40,357
That's a lot of the money and we have to
make it last our whole lives.

110
00:09:46,423 --> 00:09:50,449
Alright, for 400 dollars.
I even go to the casino.

111
00:09:50,604 --> 00:09:53,244
You don't have to gamble,
I'll gonna go with you.

112
00:09:53,404 --> 00:09:56,394
Oh, wait a minute.
- I just go to see it.

113
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:59,158
And what about Helen?
- I just saw Helen, she's doing fine.

114
00:09:59,312 --> 00:10:02,912
You go watch your pledge.
- Not true. I look only.

115
00:10:03,072 --> 00:10:08,015
That may not be a problem.
- I ain't takin' the rap for you.

116
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:17,296
As if you play against a baby.
- Of a baby who plays himself?

117
00:10:17,457 --> 00:10:20,217
I understand him. I'm still young.
That's really funny.

118
00:10:21,792 --> 00:10:24,858
To bad there's no minimum age
for making money.

119
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,568
Ok, that was fun.

120
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:37,360
But I must go,
otherwise I come home too late.

121
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,925
Pocket money for the next month.

122
00:10:47,456 --> 00:10:49,442
Get that out for me.

123
00:10:49,605 --> 00:10:51,743
You need to do this professionally.

124
00:10:51,906 --> 00:10:55,277
Nice playin' in there.
- Thank you. That's nice.

125
00:10:55,436 --> 00:10:57,192
What do you think, Tommy?

126
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,451
I think he could have done a lot better.

127
00:11:02,648 --> 00:11:04,219
Are you talking about me?

128
00:11:05,525 --> 00:11:09,660
If I saw you bluffing,
everybody at the table saw you bluffing.

129
00:11:11,126 --> 00:11:15,075
What are you talking about, I flopped a set.
- You missed the flush.

130
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:21,896
Maybe you need to get your eyes checked.
- Maybe.

131
00:11:23,248 --> 00:11:27,885
Listen, you have a lot of potential,
so if you ever want to talk about strategy...

132
00:11:28,043 --> 00:11:29,953
I think he's ok.

133
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:33,175
You could do a whole lot worse.

134
00:11:36,253 --> 00:11:37,933
Okay then.

135
00:11:39,744 --> 00:11:41,424
Tommy Vinson.

136
00:11:45,882 --> 00:11:49,133
What he was talking about?
- He is determined drunk.

137
00:11:49,296 --> 00:11:51,172
Did you really flop a set?

138
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,699
No, I missed my flush.

139
00:12:03,797 --> 00:12:05,629
I knew that you would show up.

140
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:08,966
No, I came to play cards.

141
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:12,228
No, just give me five minutes.

142
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,712
See that guy with the red hat?

143
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,819
What about him?
- What kind of hand has he got?

144
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,617
Good or bad?

145
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:31,105
Good.
- Wrong.

146
00:12:32,568 --> 00:12:35,819
You know how I know?
- How?

147
00:12:35,982 --> 00:12:40,347
When he has bad cards,
he scratches to his face.

148
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:44,874
He does this every time.
It's a tell. Watch.

149
00:12:50,905 --> 00:12:52,585
In that way.

150
00:12:57,273 --> 00:12:58,921
You were just lucky.

151
00:13:02,184 --> 00:13:04,322
Pick somebody. Anybody.

152
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,002
That guy over there.

153
00:13:13,654 --> 00:13:15,334
He has a good hand.

154
00:13:17,068 --> 00:13:20,668
Ace-King maybe,
or an Ace-Queen.

155
00:13:27,042 --> 00:13:29,301
You should be playing against them.

156
00:13:30,341 --> 00:13:32,022
I don't play.

157
00:13:36,364 --> 00:13:38,972
Can you give me that napkin please?

158
00:13:40,699 --> 00:13:42,532
Nice accent. Is it German?

159
00:13:43,883 --> 00:13:45,454
No, Russian.

160
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,906
Then you drink a lot of vodka then.

161
00:13:57,463 --> 00:14:02,210
I hope you're better with cards
than you are with women.

162
00:14:02,373 --> 00:14:07,163
Really I am. You know I won $22,000
in PokerStars last month?

163
00:14:07,322 --> 00:14:12,385
The Razor, she's just so...

164
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:15,529
She ate you up.
- You saw it?

165
00:14:17,258 --> 00:14:19,669
I had really bad cards.

166
00:14:19,828 --> 00:14:20,978
It's not on the cards.

167
00:14:20,979 --> 00:14:23,854
You don't play against cards,
you play against players.

168
00:14:29,572 --> 00:14:33,172
What do you have in mind?
Million dollar pay outs.

169
00:14:34,252 --> 00:14:39,119
I cover the buy-ins and we split
50-50 right down the middle.

170
00:14:40,851 --> 00:14:44,833
Cash?
- Not yet, first you gotta win.

171
00:14:46,298 --> 00:14:49,898
But you gotta listen to me,
every word.

172
00:14:51,132 --> 00:14:52,812
Why should I do that?

173
00:14:54,431 --> 00:14:58,380
Because by the time you're twenty-five,
you'll be set for life.

174
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:01,248
You set for life?

175
00:15:02,678 --> 00:15:06,203
I could have been,
if I'd had someone to listen too.

176
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,042
You found it.

177
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,229
Nice house.

178
00:15:27,652 --> 00:15:31,100
Would you like something cold to drink?
A coke, soft drink, beer?

179
00:15:31,258 --> 00:15:33,473
Beer.

180
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:39,343
Is that you?
- Yes. Not to believe, eh?

181
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:43,609
The poker finale of 1979 in Reno.
What's this?

182
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,954
My wife put that up there.

183
00:15:48,955 --> 00:15:52,084
That's the hand I was dealt
when I beat Doyle Bronson.

184
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:53,085
Oh, My God.

185
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:59,098
You beat Doyle Brunson
in the World Championship?

186
00:15:59,262 --> 00:16:02,023
They didn't call it that back then.

187
00:16:02,024 --> 00:16:03,024
Shit.

188
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,399
It was just called 'the game'.

189
00:16:06,283 --> 00:16:10,309
Now it's for huge pots,

190
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:13,109
diamond bracelets.

191
00:16:16,717 --> 00:16:18,899
You never won a Championship?

192
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:26,070
I was in the top ten.

193
00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:29,445
It was great.

194
00:16:29,607 --> 00:16:33,785
For five years I was the best there was.

195
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,310
And then I...

196
00:16:39,926 --> 00:16:42,643
I lost my confidence.

197
00:16:44,951 --> 00:16:47,013
You lose a lot of games...

198
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:51,119
you borrow a lot of money...

199
00:16:53,123 --> 00:16:54,803
from friends...

200
00:16:55,885 --> 00:16:57,565
family.

201
00:17:00,642 --> 00:17:05,235
You keep on playing...
and you hate the world.

202
00:17:07,892 --> 00:17:11,612
I mean... I lost everything.

203
00:17:16,485 --> 00:17:18,438
I almost lost my wife.

204
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,374
She told me that if I'd quit...

205
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:29,870
well... she'd stay.

206
00:17:34,362 --> 00:17:37,231
I quit and I haven't...

207
00:17:37,392 --> 00:17:41,571
haven't picked up any cards in 20 years.

208
00:17:45,448 --> 00:17:48,590
20 years?
You haven't played poker in 20 years?

209
00:17:49,438 --> 00:17:50,965
Not even at home.

210
00:17:55,461 --> 00:17:57,141
Do you miss it?

211
00:17:58,338 --> 00:18:00,869
Not as much as I'd miss her.

212
00:18:05,934 --> 00:18:08,497
If I...

213
00:18:08,657 --> 00:18:13,753
If we are going to do,
should we sign something?

214
00:18:17,365 --> 00:18:21,806
Will we see each other differently
just trust?

215
00:18:31,137 --> 00:18:33,664
Are you sure your wife's not
going to come home and kill us?

216
00:18:33,665 --> 00:18:34,203
- Don't worry.

217
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,571
She won't be home until tomorrow.
Concentrate.

218
00:18:38,733 --> 00:18:41,264
Gus Hansen.
What's he doin'?

219
00:18:42,953 --> 00:18:46,052
I don't know.
He's playing too fast.

220
00:18:46,214 --> 00:18:48,243
He  shuffles the cards.

221
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,845
He knows what he has.
These guys know exactly what they have.

222
00:18:54,001 --> 00:18:55,877
A false tell.

223
00:18:57,837 --> 00:19:01,590
Alright, I think I got it.
Let's go try it out with the University guys.

224
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:06,040
Come on.
We've been through a 100 games.

225
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,381
You think you're ready?
- Tommy, please.

226
00:19:10,535 --> 00:19:13,240
You want me to do this, the only way
I'm going to learn is making bets.

227
00:19:13,241 --> 00:19:14,517
The casino is just 20 minutes away.

228
00:19:15,062 --> 00:19:18,204
If we're gonna do this,
let's do it right.

229
00:19:46,365 --> 00:19:50,653
Look who we have there.
God, it's been a long time.

230
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:53,423
How you doin', Barry?
- That your kid?

231
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,832
That's my kid.
- Well, have a seat.

232
00:20:01,365 --> 00:20:05,391
Yo, son.
Are you sure you handle this?

233
00:20:06,352 --> 00:20:08,261
We'll see.

234
00:20:25,072 --> 00:20:27,680
I raise.
Call.

235
00:20:27,834 --> 00:20:29,515
500.

236
00:20:33,742 --> 00:20:35,772
I fold.

237
00:20:48,435 --> 00:20:50,693
I raise with five.
- I fold.

238
00:20:51,887 --> 00:20:53,382
I call.

239
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,388
Give me something good.

240
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:11,519
All in.

241
00:21:14,866 --> 00:21:16,546
I'm all in.

242
00:21:19,393 --> 00:21:21,073
I fold.

243
00:21:25,071 --> 00:21:27,526
This is a little different than
playing on the Internet, huh son?

244
00:21:39,763 --> 00:21:43,593
What'd ya say we take a break?
- I just got bad cards. They did.

245
00:21:43,753 --> 00:21:46,699
Come on, Tom, let ATM stay.
- Yeah.

246
00:21:57,026 --> 00:21:59,557
You bite your lower lip.
- What are you talking about?

247
00:21:59,711 --> 00:22:03,693
Every time you get a bad hand,
you bite your lower lip.

248
00:22:03,854 --> 00:22:06,724
No I don't.
- We continue.

249
00:22:06,885 --> 00:22:11,250
Wait. Come, stay well.
- If I see it, everybody at the table sees it.

250
00:22:11,412 --> 00:22:14,401
I'm here to learn.
Give me one more chance.

251
00:22:40,989 --> 00:22:42,407
I'm all in.

252
00:22:57,791 --> 00:23:01,043
Well then, cash.
What'd you think I otta buy?

253
00:23:01,206 --> 00:23:02,657
A BMW?

254
00:23:06,001 --> 00:23:07,724
Or a Vet?

255
00:23:10,758 --> 00:23:13,125
I like BMW myself.

256
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,305
The kid has a straight.

257
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,665
It was OK?
- Yeah, it went good.

258
00:23:31,818 --> 00:23:35,725
Yeah, I did.
You like the lip?

259
00:23:35,885 --> 00:23:41,406
These guys have long memories.
Next time, don't try the same thing.

260
00:23:48,199 --> 00:23:50,839
When was the last time you had any?

261
00:23:51,882 --> 00:23:57,054
When was your last time?
- I'm doin' fine in that department, thank you.

262
00:23:57,055 --> 00:23:58,055
Yeah.

263
00:23:59,516 --> 00:24:01,272
Why do you care, anyway?

264
00:24:02,355 --> 00:24:04,307
A young guy,

265
00:24:04,464 --> 00:24:07,377
testosterone popping out every pore.

266
00:24:08,492 --> 00:24:11,514
It seems like you should give it a run.

267
00:24:12,175 --> 00:24:16,692
I just want you to be happy.
- I don't know. I'm...

268
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,877
for whatever reason
I've gone out with a girl, I...

269
00:24:21,037 --> 00:24:25,140
I just wish they'd come up to me,
it's be a whole lot easier.

270
00:24:25,295 --> 00:24:29,889
You know, some of these skills you
learn at the tables, people skills...

271
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:32,735
watching, observing, listening...

272
00:24:33,735 --> 00:24:37,837
they come in handy
if you just apply them in other areas.

273
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:43,629
Like that tall drink of water over there.

274
00:24:43,785 --> 00:24:46,578
Just go over to her
and say hello.

275
00:24:48,351 --> 00:24:50,226
Everything will be fine.

276
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:54,021
Trust me.

277
00:24:58,516 --> 00:25:00,655
I will do that.

278
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:12,591
Hi... I'm sorry, I don't normally do this, but...
- I'm a Virgo...

279
00:25:12,749 --> 00:25:16,731
and before you ask,
no, I don't come here often.

280
00:25:22,032 --> 00:25:24,488
I've never done that before.

281
00:25:24,641 --> 00:25:28,394
The reason that I'm here...
see that old man behind me?

282
00:25:28,554 --> 00:25:32,231
He thinks that I'm terrible with girls,
and that's probably true.

283
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:35,456
Would you even can giggle?
- I don't think so.

284
00:25:36,648 --> 00:25:39,136
What should I do
so you could help me out here?

285
00:25:39,295 --> 00:25:41,859
Tell me why you're so
terrible with women.

286
00:25:43,438 --> 00:25:45,119
I... I don't know, uh...

287
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,735
probability?

288
00:25:48,771 --> 00:25:52,677
I wasn't expecting that one.
- What I mean is...

289
00:25:52,837 --> 00:25:55,609
Asking a girl out is very
simply a 50-50 proposition.

290
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:57,354
She either says yes or she says no.

291
00:25:57,517 --> 00:26:00,998
I don't like to do anything where you only
have a 50 percent chance of succeeding.

292
00:26:01,162 --> 00:26:06,639
Well, if 50 percent odds are not enough for you,
then you my friend are in the town.

293
00:26:07,645 --> 00:26:10,176
No, that's not true.
Take poker for example.

294
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:13,125
In poker if you have bad
cards, it doesn't matter,

295
00:26:13,126 --> 00:26:15,152
you still have the option of bluffing.

296
00:26:16,468 --> 00:26:19,228
And you don't think
that applies to women too?

297
00:26:23,258 --> 00:26:24,785
Good luck, honey.
Bye

298
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,355
Alright, let's start over.

299
00:26:30,508 --> 00:26:32,079
Ask me out.

300
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:34,608
You see I don't even know your name.
- Michelle.

301
00:26:35,189 --> 00:26:36,760
Hi, I'm Alex.

302
00:26:38,411 --> 00:26:41,280
Would you like to go out
with me sometime?

303
00:26:41,442 --> 00:26:44,354
I don't know Alex,
what do you do?

304
00:26:44,511 --> 00:26:49,333
I just graduated college and I'm
working part time at a law firm.

305
00:26:52,797 --> 00:26:54,324
No, thanks.

306
00:26:54,715 --> 00:27:00,847
No, wait, wait, I make... I make unlimited
CEO for a Fortune 500 company,

307
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,834
we're in software development,

308
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:09,628
and I travel all over the whole world to exotic
countries which maybe you'd love to go?

309
00:27:09,791 --> 00:27:11,318
Really?

310
00:27:13,013 --> 00:27:15,654
So, I would love to go out with you.

311
00:27:20,916 --> 00:27:22,487
Seven-two.

312
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:26,624
Could you just spot me a couple?
- I never do. It's all or nothing with me.

313
00:27:26,785 --> 00:27:28,280
Of course you do.

314
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:35,426
I hope you're better at cards
than you are at air hockey.

315
00:27:35,427 --> 00:27:36,173
- You know what?

316
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:39,938
This time I'm gonna win.
- Let's go.

317
00:27:43,089 --> 00:27:44,583
Oh my god, are you OK?

318
00:27:44,584 --> 00:27:45,584
Yeah.

319
00:27:51,913 --> 00:27:54,018
What if I'm not?

320
00:27:54,593 --> 00:27:57,996
Well I...

321
00:28:06,452 --> 00:28:09,932
I'm fine.
- The bounce.

322
00:28:10,096 --> 00:28:11,547
The bounce.

323
00:28:19,571 --> 00:28:21,372
Good trip, huh?

324
00:28:22,065 --> 00:28:23,745
Definitely.

325
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:30,840
You like that girl?
You have a good time last night?

326
00:28:32,154 --> 00:28:34,413
And this morning.

327
00:28:36,029 --> 00:28:39,171
You're a machine.
- Oh, I wouldn't say that.

328
00:28:43,663 --> 00:28:46,652
You have to focus from now on.

329
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:50,790
I'm focused. We're going to make all the way.
- All the way.

330
00:28:50,952 --> 00:28:53,363
To hear me.

331
00:28:53,522 --> 00:28:58,236
Friday night there's a tournament
in New Orleans.

332
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:03,409
Next Friday?
- Yes. Is that a problem?

333
00:29:03,573 --> 00:29:06,410
No, not a problem.

334
00:29:06,565 --> 00:29:09,331
Hey Dad, a friend of mine
wants to go to Santa Barbara,

335
00:29:09,332 --> 00:29:11,159
I was wondering if I could take a day?

336
00:29:11,322 --> 00:29:14,344
I know, I know.  This is the last time.
I swear.

337
00:29:14,659 --> 00:29:16,307
Thanks. Bye.

338
00:29:16,462 --> 00:29:19,484
Bad news, baby,
I gotta to Cleveland.

339
00:29:19,646 --> 00:29:23,094
I should be back by Monday.
I'll call you later this evening.

340
00:30:03,072 --> 00:30:07,098
Well done. We are going to rest.
Tomorrow is a big day.

341
00:30:07,254 --> 00:30:12,120
Rest? I've won.
Let us go a little drink, or something.

342
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,340
So far so good.

343
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:20,522
That's all you got to say?

344
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,587
Just calm down.

345
00:30:24,747 --> 00:30:28,379
Maybe you'll feel better tomorrow
when I win $600,000.

346
00:30:48,147 --> 00:30:50,439
What about Helen!

347
00:30:50,603 --> 00:30:53,058
Do not answer the phone.

348
00:30:53,211 --> 00:30:56,081
Why?
- Because...

349
00:30:57,508 --> 00:31:01,065
Your opponents tomorrow
want to keep you up

350
00:31:01,229 --> 00:31:02,510
Maybe it's important.

351
00:31:02,511 --> 00:31:05,866
- Don't open the door,
I'm telling you for your own good.

352
00:31:06,024 --> 00:31:07,704
What if it's important.

353
00:31:09,016 --> 00:31:11,962
Hi, I'm Shaniqua
and this is my friend Alley.

354
00:31:16,497 --> 00:31:18,100
I told you.

355
00:31:27,277 --> 00:31:30,528
You can can beat everyone at this table,
with or without sleep.

356
00:32:16,994 --> 00:32:19,863
Rough cards.
- False.

357
00:32:20,024 --> 00:32:22,741
You know it's not the cards
and so do I.

358
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:24,931
There isn't anything I could do.

359
00:32:26,354 --> 00:32:28,645
You're tired.

360
00:32:28,809 --> 00:32:31,220
You're right back to your old bad habits.

361
00:32:31,379 --> 00:32:33,943
You're in love with your money.

362
00:32:34,103 --> 00:32:37,354
I can tell what everyone has.
- No, you can't.

363
00:32:37,901 --> 00:32:41,381
Then why don't you go and play?
- Because I promised somebody I wouldn't.

364
00:32:42,965 --> 00:32:45,299
You call lying to your wife a promise?

365
00:32:53,821 --> 00:32:56,188
You'd better go home.

366
00:33:10,777 --> 00:33:12,762
What's going on, Honey?

367
00:33:13,263 --> 00:33:14,263
What?

368
00:33:16,186 --> 00:33:17,713
Where were you, in Las Vegas?

369
00:33:21,097 --> 00:33:23,466
Well, went to New Orleans.
-New Orleans?

370
00:33:23,467 --> 00:33:25,766
Yeah, for a tournament.
- I knew it.

371
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:29,563
I'm not playing any cards at all.
I'm just teaching a kid...

372
00:33:29,728 --> 00:33:34,059
How much did you lose?
-$10,000.

373
00:33:34,216 --> 00:33:36,513
$10,000?
-Yeah.

374
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,810
Tommy.
- But in Vegas...

375
00:33:38,973 --> 00:33:41,733
When were you in Vegas?

376
00:33:43,155 --> 00:33:45,567
I want you to understand though,
we were in Vegas...

377
00:33:45,568 --> 00:33:46,907
- I'm goin' to my sisters.

378
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:59,841
Hi, Michelle, it's me.
Can you call me back?

379
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:06,131
Three messages, and she won't call me back.
- Will you stop worrying about her.

380
00:34:06,287 --> 00:34:09,887
Let's think of winning.
- What's first place, anyway?

381
00:34:10,046 --> 00:34:12,151
$500,000.

382
00:34:28,498 --> 00:34:31,445
Guess who?
- How many guesses do I get?

383
00:34:31,606 --> 00:34:35,479
One. Did you have fun the other night?
- Oh my god, you're here.

384
00:34:35,634 --> 00:34:40,577
How's it going so far?
- Really good, but it just got a whole lot better.

385
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:47,861
It's nice to see you again.

386
00:34:49,598 --> 00:34:51,856
Yeah, you too.

387
00:34:52,014 --> 00:34:54,153
Do you want some?
- No, thanks.

388
00:35:02,219 --> 00:35:03,670
What?

389
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,553
Nothing.

390
00:35:06,323 --> 00:35:08,428
There's just something about you.

391
00:35:21,361 --> 00:35:23,161
You're a nice guy.

392
00:35:40,734 --> 00:35:42,687
Is there something wrong?

393
00:35:45,913 --> 00:35:48,368
I wish...
- What?

394
00:35:50,785 --> 00:35:54,418
I wish I'd met you under
different circumstances.

395
00:35:55,849 --> 00:35:57,605
What do you mean?

396
00:36:06,015 --> 00:36:07,967
You know.

397
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:13,340
You live in LA, I live in Vegas.

398
00:36:14,876 --> 00:36:19,742
So? That's only 300 miles away.
4.5 hours by car, one hour by plane.

399
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:34,859
Where are you going?

400
00:36:37,203 --> 00:36:39,614
Well, my father's in town.

401
00:36:43,955 --> 00:36:46,289
I've got to go.

402
00:36:49,786 --> 00:36:52,393
And I need to rest.
- You can sleep here.

403
00:37:13,455 --> 00:37:15,440
I'll call you later, okay?

404
00:37:21,703 --> 00:37:23,612
Good luck tomorrow.

405
00:37:29,145 --> 00:37:32,287
Is she there?
- Yeah, I'll call her, hold on.

406
00:37:39,579 --> 00:37:41,455
How's it going?

407
00:37:42,687 --> 00:37:46,058
Where are you?
- I'm in...

408
00:37:47,137 --> 00:37:50,159
I'm in Vegas with that kid,
Alex.

409
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:54,270
The World Poker Tour Championship.

410
00:37:54,425 --> 00:37:55,966
It starts in about two weeks.

411
00:37:55,967 --> 00:37:58,943
I need to get him in shape
and then get him out of here.

412
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:05,659
Listen, this is it.
If it's over, then it's all over.

413
00:38:05,819 --> 00:38:08,579
I never thought we'd have
this conversation again.

414
00:38:08,734 --> 00:38:14,027
Listen, we got our money back,
all the money, a lot and some interest.

415
00:38:14,182 --> 00:38:15,245
That's not the point.

416
00:38:15,246 --> 00:38:17,979
- What do you mean it's not
the point, it is the point.

417
00:38:18,133 --> 00:38:19,781
Goodbye, Tommy.

418
00:39:36,545 --> 00:39:39,033
Sorry about those last few hands.
- You'll do fine.

419
00:39:39,192 --> 00:39:42,411
And we made some money.
- And what we have earned.

420
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:45,089
A little money, come on.
60 grand each.

421
00:39:47,056 --> 00:39:49,315
Well, minus expenses.

422
00:39:50,355 --> 00:39:52,188
Bellagio.
Bellagio.

423
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,790
Hold on.

424
00:40:01,791 --> 00:40:02,791
Michelle.
Michelle.

425
00:40:05,792 --> 00:40:06,792
Hey.
- Hi.

426
00:40:10,419 --> 00:40:14,445
Is this your dad?
- Yeah, I'm her daddy.

427
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,967
At least for tonight.

428
00:40:17,132 --> 00:40:18,932
Wait. What?

429
00:40:22,541 --> 00:40:24,832
Go find you own girl.

430
00:40:30,712 --> 00:40:32,971
Do you feel bad for me or something?

431
00:40:34,778 --> 00:40:38,837
Look, you don't understand that at this point...
- Did anyone pay you?

432
00:40:56,261 --> 00:40:58,094
It's Tommy.

433
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:04,116
I'm sorry about the girl.
It was a dumb idea.

434
00:41:12,117 --> 00:41:13,117
Hello.

435
00:41:30,618 --> 00:41:31,618
Hello.

436
00:41:31,936 --> 00:41:33,430
Hi, what are you doing?

437
00:41:33,931 --> 00:41:37,958
Listen to me, I know this seems
like a hell of a lot of money.

438
00:41:38,766 --> 00:41:44,363
When you think about it,
it's nothing compared to what we could do.

439
00:41:45,173 --> 00:41:48,501
Don't walk away
over some girl.

440
00:41:48,664 --> 00:41:50,082
Don't you mean a hooker?

441
00:41:52,998 --> 00:41:56,065
I just thought I'd help.
- By fucking with my feelings?

442
00:41:56,221 --> 00:42:00,280
Alex, listen.
- I'm done, we're through. It's over

443
00:42:02,512 --> 00:42:04,923
Helping people is more than that.

444
00:42:11,834 --> 00:42:14,093
Yeah...
Maybe you're right.

445
00:42:18,241 --> 00:42:20,041
I'm home.

446
00:42:24,801 --> 00:42:27,790
Jordy, let us alone.
- Just one more second.

447
00:42:27,791 --> 00:42:28,791
Jordan.

448
00:42:33,892 --> 00:42:35,878
I'll hear everything.

449
00:42:39,186 --> 00:42:43,474
Where were you this weekend?
I told you, I was with Ben.

450
00:42:49,007 --> 00:42:53,186
Alright, I was in Vegas...
Look, I came in third.

451
00:42:56,372 --> 00:43:00,933
Alex, I didn't spend the last 20 years
of my life working my ass off

452
00:43:01,091 --> 00:43:05,270
so you could play cards for a living!
- I had a partial scholarship.

453
00:43:05,426 --> 00:43:08,830
And who do you think paid
the other half?

454
00:43:08,994 --> 00:43:13,096
Ok fine.
Here. Here's the other half.

455
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:18,583
You won that?
- $62,000.

456
00:43:18,737 --> 00:43:22,687
And in two weeks is the big one,
like eight million dollars.

457
00:43:25,106 --> 00:43:28,401
Alex, listen to me.
You have a job.

458
00:43:31,243 --> 00:43:34,156
Not anymore.
I'm quitting.

459
00:43:34,157 --> 00:43:35,157
Oh, Alex... now...

460
00:44:27,367 --> 00:44:28,397
Hello, this is Helen.

461
00:44:28,398 --> 00:44:31,732
Please leave a message and I'll
get back to you as soon as possible.

462
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:58,861
In Las Vegas,
written history.

463
00:44:59,016 --> 00:45:02,573
There will a battle
for the game's ultimate title.

464
00:45:02,737 --> 00:45:08,443
It's for the 15 million dollar WPC Championship
here on the World Poker Tour.

465
00:45:08,606 --> 00:45:11,973
Hi everyone, welcome to the
biggest week of the poker year,

466
00:45:11,974 --> 00:45:13,320
the WPC World Championship.

467
00:45:13,478 --> 00:45:15,626
I'm Mike Sexton along
with Vince Van Patten.

468
00:45:15,627 --> 00:45:18,300
And Vince, this is going to
be an amazing week for poker.

469
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:21,684
Mike, we have five
exciting days of poker ahead of us.

470
00:45:21,841 --> 00:45:24,014
Each player has to put up a $25,000 each

471
00:45:24,015 --> 00:45:27,056
and the winner is gonna take home
over eight million dollars.

472
00:45:27,212 --> 00:45:30,583
And what's really exciting about this,
is that everyone is playing today.

473
00:45:30,741 --> 00:45:32,808
All superstars in the game
are playing this match.

474
00:45:32,809 --> 00:45:34,876
Yeah, you're right Vince,
all the greats are here.

475
00:45:35,038 --> 00:45:38,911
Razor Jones, Doyle Brunson,
Gus Hansen, Phil Ivey...

476
00:45:39,066 --> 00:45:43,550
Daniel Negraneu, Mike 'Double
Diamond' Jackson, Tex Button...

477
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:45,708
and a rookie who's been making big noise

478
00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:49,261
and just played his first WPC event
earlier this season... Alex Stillman.

479
00:45:49,423 --> 00:45:52,827
Alex is a great player, he's a young a rookie.
They're all talking about him.

480
00:45:52,991 --> 00:45:56,106
He finished tenth at a tournament
in New Orleans a couple weeks ago,

481
00:45:56,107 --> 00:45:57,551
so everybody's talking about him.

482
00:45:57,709 --> 00:46:01,888
But there is another great story,
and that is a fantastic player that is back.

483
00:46:02,044 --> 00:46:04,991
A big comeback for the phenomenal
Tommy Vinson.

484
00:46:05,152 --> 00:46:07,214
What a great moment this must be.

485
00:46:07,377 --> 00:46:09,965
Tommy supposedly taught
one of our young entries,

486
00:46:09,966 --> 00:46:12,243
Alex Stillman, a thing
or two about the game.

487
00:46:12,402 --> 00:46:16,002
And Tommy hasn't played any
tournament poker in over 20 years.

488
00:46:16,162 --> 00:46:19,882
I can tell you, that's a long time to
be away from poker at this level.

489
00:46:20,036 --> 00:46:23,669
Doyle and Tommy bring a lot of
history to this tournament.

490
00:46:23,834 --> 00:46:25,328
Should be a lot of fun.

491
00:47:37,527 --> 00:47:41,204
If you ready participate in this rodeo?
It's gonna be a rough one now.

492
00:47:41,363 --> 00:47:44,450
That's what I thought easy to go
home and take up playin' bridge,

493
00:47:44,451 --> 00:47:45,619
you're gonna lose your ass

494
00:47:45,775 --> 00:47:47,531
What you holdin' Tommy?

495
00:47:49,458 --> 00:47:52,370
You want any of these chips?

496
00:47:56,325 --> 00:47:58,234
You're all  goin' down.

497
00:48:27,743 --> 00:48:31,343
Thank you.
- Nah, don't even mention it.

498
00:48:33,421 --> 00:48:36,519
I can't believe that he is playing again, Johnny.
- I know.

499
00:48:37,525 --> 00:48:39,784
Why now?
Is it me?

500
00:48:39,785 --> 00:48:40,785
Oh, no.

501
00:48:44,162 --> 00:48:46,693
What can possibly be in the cards now?

502
00:48:48,343 --> 00:48:51,104
Dignity, respect.

503
00:48:52,525 --> 00:48:55,547
He just wants to hit a home run.

504
00:48:55,709 --> 00:48:57,618
Before the sun sets.

505
00:48:58,279 --> 00:48:59,927
With you.

506
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:03,912
He wants the title that he never had.

507
00:49:04,072 --> 00:49:07,629
Something that no one
can ever take away from him.

508
00:49:27,319 --> 00:49:29,075
I'm all in.

509
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:36,633
I'm all in too.

510
00:49:50,375 --> 00:49:53,015
Damn it. Well done, Tommy.
- Take care of yourself.

511
00:50:35,016 --> 00:50:36,016
Ok...

512
00:50:46,016 --> 00:50:47,016
Hi.
-Hi.

513
00:50:51,677 --> 00:50:53,204
Can I come in?

514
00:51:10,206 --> 00:51:13,806
How'd you find me?
- I've got my ways.

515
00:51:29,349 --> 00:51:31,989
So, listen.
- No, you listen.

516
00:51:35,947 --> 00:51:37,627
I love you.

517
00:51:39,246 --> 00:51:43,228
And I know that you needed to do
this more than I needed you not to.

518
00:51:46,074 --> 00:51:48,366
Therefore, I ask only one thing of you.

519
00:51:50,409 --> 00:51:54,620
When you make it to the final table... win.

520
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:57,121
Win it all.

521
00:52:09,053 --> 00:52:11,923
100,000.
- I raise to 200.

522
00:52:17,109 --> 00:52:19,062
500,000.
- I'm all in.

523
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,593
I'm all in.
- Me too.

524
00:52:20,754 --> 00:52:22,859
It's crunch time,
there's only nine people remaining.

525
00:52:23,017 --> 00:52:26,159
400,000.
- But only six make it to the final table.

526
00:52:26,316 --> 00:52:29,720
The pressure is mounting,
they're looking for the big money.

527
00:52:30,267 --> 00:52:33,060
Two million.
- I'm out.

528
00:52:33,221 --> 00:52:36,243
Two million.
- We have already done.

529
00:52:37,556 --> 00:52:41,081
What do you have? An Ace high?
I'm in.

530
00:52:55,203 --> 00:52:56,883
I'll call.

531
00:53:02,645 --> 00:53:04,139
I'm gone.

532
00:53:09,051 --> 00:53:11,659
Nice hand, Tommy.
- And they call me a magician.

533
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:14,726
Tommy Vinson has knocked out
the 'Unabomber'.

534
00:53:14,882 --> 00:53:16,563
500.

535
00:53:35,329 --> 00:53:37,085
I raise to 1.5.

536
00:53:48,334 --> 00:53:49,861
I'm all in.

537
00:53:59,843 --> 00:54:01,446
Call.

538
00:54:04,945 --> 00:54:07,814
If Razor gets a Jack,
an Ace or a spade she'll cripple Alex

539
00:54:07,975 --> 00:54:12,340
and put him on the working trips.
Here we go with the river.

540
00:54:13,346 --> 00:54:15,026
It's a three.

541
00:54:18,793 --> 00:54:20,364
I could read you like a book.

542
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:23,237
Seven players left.
We're down to the wire.

543
00:54:23,397 --> 00:54:26,692
Who's goin' home and
who will fulfill their dream?

544
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:37,857
200,000.

545
00:54:43,498 --> 00:54:45,179
You got something?

546
00:54:48,639 --> 00:54:50,821
Okay then.
I'd like to raise.

547
00:54:50,979 --> 00:54:53,270
700,000.

548
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:01,672
All in.
- Tommy goes all in.

549
00:55:01,835 --> 00:55:05,588
The 'Magician' really has an
important decision to make now.

550
00:55:07,628 --> 00:55:09,767
You're sure about this?
- Oh, yeah.

551
00:55:12,385 --> 00:55:14,524
I can't fold.

552
00:55:15,953 --> 00:55:19,673
Well, I call.
- Antonio calls with the pocket Jacks.

553
00:55:21,899 --> 00:55:24,081
Almost 50-50.
- Here comes the flop.

554
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:26,801
Keep it small.

555
00:55:27,768 --> 00:55:29,219
Small.

556
00:55:29,725 --> 00:55:31,601
No Ace, no King, please.

557
00:55:32,717 --> 00:55:36,241
He gets his Ace on the river, Vince.

558
00:55:42,116 --> 00:55:43,642
Nice hand, Tommy.

559
00:55:44,647 --> 00:55:46,098
Good luck, guys.

560
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:49,205
Do good with my chips.
- I'll do my best.

561
00:55:49,366 --> 00:55:53,577
And Antonio the 'Magician' disappears.
Abracadabra.

562
00:55:53,739 --> 00:55:58,180
That's it. We are down to six.
We'll see you tomorrow at the final table.

563
00:56:05,977 --> 00:56:07,657
Crazy, huh?

564
00:56:09,046 --> 00:56:10,802
Look there. Alex.

565
00:56:13,726 --> 00:56:16,824
Oh, my god. What are you doing here?
- Ben told us where to go.

566
00:56:16,987 --> 00:56:18,939
This is great.
- We wanted to come.

567
00:56:19,096 --> 00:56:21,737
Book a room.
I've checked us in.

568
00:56:21,897 --> 00:56:26,000
Give me two seconds, ok. I need to do something.
Say that you're my parents.

569
00:56:27,728 --> 00:56:30,902
Do you want some more?
- No.

570
00:56:32,677 --> 00:56:34,280
Excuse me, Mr. Vinson.

571
00:56:34,441 --> 00:56:37,616
There's a phone call for you at the Bar.

572
00:56:37,617 --> 00:56:38,617
Hello.

573
00:56:55,003 --> 00:56:57,142
Looks like you're doing pretty
well in the tournament.

574
00:56:58,494 --> 00:57:00,633
I could say the same for you.

575
00:57:02,944 --> 00:57:06,348
The final table.
Life is full of surprises.

576
00:57:06,512 --> 00:57:08,192
Yes, that's right.

577
00:57:10,118 --> 00:57:12,529
I just wanted to wish
you good luck tomorrow.

578
00:57:14,376 --> 00:57:15,980
Good luck to you too, pal.

579
00:57:16,985 --> 00:57:20,934
Second place is not bad
for someone of your age.

580
00:57:21,089 --> 00:57:26,916
And you're not bad for a guy your age either.
My wife is here.

581
00:57:27,074 --> 00:57:29,103
I've got just one thing I want to say.

582
00:57:33,212 --> 00:57:34,892
I know your tell.

583
00:57:38,314 --> 00:57:40,190
See you tomorrow.

584
00:57:45,488 --> 00:57:48,968
Hello everyone. We are coming to you live
from the Bellagio in Las Vegas,

585
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:51,076
where have the largest prize pool in the

586
00:57:51,077 --> 00:57:53,311
history of World Poker
Tour will be given out.

587
00:57:53,467 --> 00:57:55,758
We've had a record number
of players entered in this years event,

588
00:57:55,922 --> 00:57:58,836
but only six still have dreams
of capturing this coveted title

589
00:57:58,837 --> 00:58:01,061
and taking home over
eight million dollars.

590
00:58:01,216 --> 00:58:02,787
Mike, this is gonna be great.

591
00:58:02,942 --> 00:58:05,574
Big money here this week and
let me tell you something,

592
00:58:05,575 --> 00:58:08,769
all the big names in the game are here,
all of the Superstars players.

593
00:58:08,927 --> 00:58:11,800
But they are gone,
we have dead men walking.

594
00:58:11,801 --> 00:58:13,716
Let's go down to our finalists.

595
00:58:13,875 --> 00:58:15,785
And what a final table.

596
00:58:15,947 --> 00:58:19,624
We have the cowboy.
Yes, hear. Back in the saddle.

597
00:58:19,783 --> 00:58:23,111
Wipe the dirt out of your hair,
because Tex Button's here..

598
00:58:23,274 --> 00:58:25,413
Then the only lady in the final table,

599
00:58:25,576 --> 00:58:30,671
She was WPC ladies champion,
from Montreal, Canada, Isabelle Mercier.

600
00:58:30,831 --> 00:58:34,738
That's right. Oui, oui. And now
the youngest player at the table.

601
00:58:34,898 --> 00:58:39,917
He is only 21 years old and
he looks like he just left a concert.

602
00:58:40,077 --> 00:58:43,372
The very talented Alex Stillman.

603
00:58:43,529 --> 00:58:48,897
The next player has already won titles in his day,
but not for any amount anything like tonight.

604
00:58:49,053 --> 00:58:53,156
I'm talking about the man, the myth,
the 'Double Diamond', Mike Jackson.

605
00:58:55,767 --> 00:58:59,214
And now a professional player who's made
many final tables in his day.

606
00:58:59,373 --> 00:59:03,476
From Los Angeles, California, Scott 'Laser' Lazar.
What a player he is.

607
00:59:03,631 --> 00:59:07,428
Now rounding out the field,
a very captivating story,

608
00:59:07,582 --> 00:59:09,729
We have an old school
poker player who is for

609
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:12,296
the first time ever on the
World Poker Tour final table.

610
00:59:12,454 --> 00:59:15,705
In fact, this man has not picked
up a card in over 20 years.

611
00:59:15,868 --> 00:59:18,399
The very talented,
Tommy Vinson.

612
00:59:18,554 --> 00:59:20,168
We have everything tonight,

613
00:59:20,169 --> 00:59:23,038
men against women,
old school versus new school.

614
00:59:23,196 --> 00:59:25,956
This is gonna be great.
- The cards are ready.

615
00:59:26,111 --> 00:59:28,904
There's a millionaire among them.
Let's go down to the table.

616
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:30,525
Coming into todays final,

617
00:59:30,526 --> 00:59:33,854
Tex Button is our chips leader,
with 12 million in chips.

618
00:59:34,014 --> 00:59:36,038
An then, in second
place is the youngster,

619
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:39,567
the new kid on the block, Alex Stillman,
he's got about 10 million in chips.

620
00:59:39,730 --> 00:59:43,788
And in the third place Mike 'Double Diamond'
Jackson with about 9.3 million.

621
00:59:48,169 --> 00:59:50,460
600,000.

622
00:59:58,105 --> 00:59:59,785
I'm out.

623
01:00:11,877 --> 01:00:13,557
Call.

624
01:00:19,396 --> 01:00:21,272
Check.

625
01:00:23,347 --> 01:00:26,140
Another 600,000.
- Tex has just a pair of nines.

626
01:00:26,301 --> 01:00:29,170
He bets another 600,000.

627
01:00:29,332 --> 01:00:31,012
Call.

628
01:00:33,283 --> 01:00:36,120
Tommy makes a flush draw hand.
- Check.

629
01:00:37,311 --> 01:00:38,991
Check.

630
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:45,281
Tommy has made a flush
but Tex has made three nines

631
01:00:53,154 --> 01:00:57,213
This can be a problem for Tex.
- Two million.

632
01:00:59,522 --> 01:01:01,475
Ok, I call.

633
01:01:01,632 --> 01:01:04,698
Tex keeps pace.
- What a disaster.

634
01:01:09,036 --> 01:01:11,370
Tex looks like a chuck wagon
just ran over him.

635
01:01:14,368 --> 01:01:15,972
Nice hand, Tommy.

636
01:01:18,396 --> 01:01:22,346
Tommy Vinson becomes the chip leader,
well over five million.

637
01:01:34,393 --> 01:01:36,652
Heart. Heart. Heart.

638
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:44,673
I'm in.
Give me a diamond Queen.

639
01:01:44,828 --> 01:01:47,850
Give me something please.

640
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:56,290
Good luck.

641
01:02:00,096 --> 01:02:02,387
I'm all in.
- Call.

642
01:02:07,308 --> 01:02:09,490
This is our first loser. Tex Button.

643
01:02:09,648 --> 01:02:13,368
He began with the largest number of chips,
and he is sixth.

644
01:02:20,658 --> 01:02:25,404
Tommy Vinson has flopped three fours.
A fantastic flop.

645
01:02:29,059 --> 01:02:33,041
Isabelle needed a ten,
and she did not get it. She is gone.

646
01:02:33,202 --> 01:02:37,490
She ends on the fifth place
but she won $585,000.

647
01:02:37,652 --> 01:02:41,056
Tommy is such a legend.
And to see him come back after 20 years

648
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:44,508
and to make the final table is
phenomenal and he's playing so well,

649
01:02:44,509 --> 01:02:46,926
I think he's got a chance
to take this tournament.

650
01:02:47,089 --> 01:02:50,308
Let's cross our fingers for Tommy.
Back to the game.

651
01:02:52,498 --> 01:02:54,179
Call.

652
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:04,426
Mike 'Double Diamond' Jackson
out of this tournament in fourth tonight.

653
01:03:04,582 --> 01:03:08,183
But he will taking home $878,000 winnings.

654
01:03:15,285 --> 01:03:17,691
We're gonna take a short break.
We are down to three.

655
01:03:17,692 --> 01:03:20,348
Stay tuned. We'll be right back with
more of the World Poker Tour.

656
01:04:15,629 --> 01:04:18,618
Well baby, it's crunch time
and it's come down to this.

657
01:04:18,774 --> 01:04:21,721
The third place winner will
take home 2.2 million dollars.

658
01:04:21,882 --> 01:04:25,210
The runner up tonight will
win a meager 4.1 million.

659
01:04:25,373 --> 01:04:29,093
And our champion tonight
capture a WPT championship title

660
01:04:29,247 --> 01:04:32,575
as well as take home just
over eight million dollars.

661
01:04:34,733 --> 01:04:39,293
Scott looks at his cards.
And he has a pair of Queens in the hole.

662
01:04:41,024 --> 01:04:42,672
8.2 million.

663
01:04:42,827 --> 01:04:48,152
Alex and Tommy have both identical hands,
Jack-King. This should be good.

664
01:04:50,193 --> 01:04:51,873
Call.

665
01:04:56,024 --> 01:04:57,704
Call.

666
01:05:04,118 --> 01:05:05,994
Here comes the flop.

667
01:05:07,341 --> 01:05:09,403
Oh, look at this. Nine, Ten, Queen.

668
01:05:09,566 --> 01:05:12,518
Alex and Tommy have flopped
a nuts King high straight,

669
01:05:12,519 --> 01:05:14,235
but 'Laser' Lazar has a flop,

670
01:05:14,399 --> 01:05:18,349
so we're going to see fireworks here.
- A disaster for either one of these guys.

671
01:05:20,269 --> 01:05:23,061
Three million.
- Lazar is committed.

672
01:05:23,223 --> 01:05:26,626
Look at that.
Once here to see how Alex deals.

673
01:05:36,419 --> 01:05:39,441
I'm all in.
- He's going all in, puts it over the top.

674
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:42,671
All in.
- Tommy's going all in as well.

675
01:05:54,641 --> 01:05:58,045
I call.
- The showdown of the tournament.

676
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:04,494
Alex and Tommy will share the pot
unless Lazar pairs the board on the river.

677
01:06:04,653 --> 01:06:07,795
Otherwise he is out and he is third.

678
01:06:07,953 --> 01:06:09,479
Here comes the turn.

679
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:12,357
The five of clubs, no help for Lazar.
- Irrelevant.

680
01:06:12,518 --> 01:06:15,464
No help for anybody.
It's a three.

681
01:06:15,625 --> 01:06:18,308
That's going to do it for Scotty Lazar.
He is out in third place..

682
01:06:18,464 --> 01:06:21,179
Incredibly then, the youngster
and the elder statesman

683
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:24,137
are gonna play heads up for the
title and the eight million bucks.

684
01:06:24,295 --> 01:06:27,590
Great, but Scotty Lazar
has performed well.

685
01:06:27,747 --> 01:06:32,417
He is out at three,
but he wins 2.2 million dollars.

686
01:06:39,294 --> 01:06:42,875
It's tradition on the World Poker Tour,
we get down to heads up play,

687
01:06:42,876 --> 01:06:45,382
we bring the trophy and
the cash out to the table.

688
01:06:45,547 --> 01:06:48,663
I tell you what, this is
going to be a great story.

689
01:06:48,664 --> 01:06:52,138
I mean, we have the youngest player,
21 years old, Alex Stillman.

690
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:56,739
What's so beautiful is that he was mentored
by the oldster, Tommy Vinson.

691
01:06:56,902 --> 01:07:01,158
And now, they'll go up against each other
for the WPT World Championship.

692
01:07:01,314 --> 01:07:04,107
So, the incredible match
of a teacher versus the pupil,

693
01:07:04,268 --> 01:07:07,214
coming down to the title
and eight million bucks.

694
01:07:07,797 --> 01:07:10,132
Well, the price of poker is going up now.

695
01:07:10,291 --> 01:07:15,080
The opening is now with a $50,000 ante.
Blinds are 250 and 500 thousand dollars.

696
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:18,381
Action at the Bellagio.
Buckle up ladies and gentlemen.

697
01:07:35,725 --> 01:07:38,823
Raise.
- Here we go.  Look at the action on hand number one.

698
01:07:38,985 --> 01:07:41,232
Alex has the worst
starting hand possible,

699
01:07:41,233 --> 01:07:44,158
but he's raising the pot,
trying to steal the first hand.

700
01:07:44,318 --> 01:07:49,140
This is beautiful. He tries pull off a Winona.
He has absolutely zip in his hand.

701
01:07:49,305 --> 01:07:52,785
Tommy knows he has nothing but junk,
but my god, I think he's gonna fold anyway.

702
01:07:52,949 --> 01:07:56,474
I fold.
- You're right. Tommy does fold.

703
01:07:56,632 --> 01:08:00,691
So Alex takes pot number one.

704
01:08:30,429 --> 01:08:32,611
Raise to two million.

705
01:08:33,613 --> 01:08:39,319
That's a two million dollar bet
and the kid is bettin' with a six and a four.

706
01:08:39,482 --> 01:08:41,970
He thinks Tommy
bad cards.

707
01:08:44,738 --> 01:08:48,109
I think you're right.
It looks like Alex has got it all figured out.

708
01:08:48,267 --> 01:08:50,835
Unless Tommy changes
things around quickly,

709
01:08:50,836 --> 01:08:52,937
his Championship hopes are dwindling.

710
01:09:22,946 --> 01:09:25,739
One million.
- Look at this man go.

711
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:28,747
Tommy has bet a million dollars
without looking at his cards.

712
01:09:28,748 --> 01:09:30,308
I've never seen anything like this.

713
01:09:30,465 --> 01:09:32,724
This is a first on the World Poker Tour.

714
01:09:32,725 --> 01:09:35,604
He's totally in the blind.
Is it gonna work or not?

715
01:09:49,224 --> 01:09:50,795
Call.

716
01:09:54,595 --> 01:09:56,504
Here comes the flop.

717
01:10:03,303 --> 01:10:05,179
Check.

718
01:10:08,290 --> 01:10:11,891
All in.
- Do you see this? Eight million on the line

719
01:10:12,050 --> 01:10:15,530
and Tommy goes it all in
without looking at his cards.

720
01:10:17,382 --> 01:10:20,448
Fold.
- Look, it's placing them on the table.

721
01:10:20,604 --> 01:10:24,554
Alex folded, so the strategy
by Tommy has worked.

722
01:10:51,064 --> 01:10:52,591
I don't believe this.

723
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:06,943
I bet one million.

724
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:15,184
Call.
- Here we go again.

725
01:11:15,347 --> 01:11:17,223
Blind man's bluff.

726
01:11:25,359 --> 01:11:27,192
Check.

727
01:11:30,538 --> 01:11:32,491
I'll bet another million.

728
01:11:35,372 --> 01:11:37,172
Call.

729
01:11:47,686 --> 01:11:49,213
All in.

730
01:12:03,376 --> 01:12:05,329
Absolutely incredible.

731
01:12:05,486 --> 01:12:10,046
The question is, how long can he keep
playing those cards in the dark.

732
01:12:10,205 --> 01:12:12,660
You can only so far sliding on barbed wire.

733
01:12:28,158 --> 01:12:33,679
Now he looks finally looks at his cards.
- Yes, and he's got two jacks.

734
01:12:33,836 --> 01:12:37,131
Let's see what he's gonna do now.
Does he push harder?

735
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,982
Check.
-2.5 Million.

736
01:12:48,145 --> 01:12:52,432
I didn't quite see Alex's cards
when he bet the 2.5 million.

737
01:13:02,223 --> 01:13:05,627
Tommy's got to love his hand,
will he be aggressive and go over the top?

738
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:07,744
Well, we shall see.

739
01:13:17,376 --> 01:13:20,704
Call.
- He's just calling. That's some playing.

740
01:13:28,041 --> 01:13:30,758
Okay, we're gonna see the flop,
here it is.

741
01:13:32,568 --> 01:13:34,392
That's a dangerous flop right there.

742
01:13:34,393 --> 01:13:36,975
Of course we don't know
what Alex has on his plate.

743
01:13:38,476 --> 01:13:39,476
Check.

744
01:13:41,977 --> 01:13:42,977
Check.

745
01:13:45,534 --> 01:13:47,410
Here's the turn card.

746
01:13:56,411 --> 01:13:57,411
Check.

747
01:13:58,615 --> 01:14:00,754
They stare at each other.

748
01:14:01,262 --> 01:14:05,244
Alex checks again.
- Yes, and now the river, Mike.

749
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:10,353
We have two pair on the board,
four's and three's and an Ace.

750
01:14:10,508 --> 01:14:13,377
Very interesting,
but danger everywhere.

751
01:14:17,298 --> 01:14:21,127
All in.
- This is it. Tommy Vinson has gone all in.

752
01:14:21,287 --> 01:14:25,957
Now if Alex should call, and he's wrong,
Tommy Vinson will become our new Champion.

753
01:14:52,130 --> 01:14:54,006
Call.
- And he's called!

754
01:14:55,314 --> 01:14:58,227
Alex is gonna need a three,
a four, a pair of Queens...

755
01:14:58,383 --> 01:15:01,373
a pair of Kings or an Ace to win this pot.

756
01:15:05,634 --> 01:15:07,543
Tommy shows his Jacks.

757
01:15:09,201 --> 01:15:11,536
Nice hand, Tommy.

758
01:15:11,695 --> 01:15:15,219
That's it. Tommy Vinson,
after a 20 years hiatis...

759
01:15:15,378 --> 01:15:19,590
has come back and captured the
World Poker Tour Championship title,

760
01:15:19,591 --> 01:15:21,510
and has won 8.2 million dollars.

761
01:15:21,669 --> 01:15:26,339
Vince, what a story.
The teacher teaches the students a lesson.

762
01:15:32,871 --> 01:15:34,976
We will talk with the Champion.

763
01:15:40,965 --> 01:15:43,147
You were top. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

764
01:15:43,305 --> 01:15:45,640
You were great.

765
01:15:45,799 --> 01:15:49,781
A second place finish is not bad, right.
- Are you crazy? Four million dollars.

766
01:15:49,942 --> 01:15:52,702
I know.
- Easy to pay for law school

767
01:15:52,857 --> 01:15:56,490
If you want to. Good job.

768
01:15:56,924 --> 01:15:58,604
Thank you.

769
01:16:01,988 --> 01:16:06,275
Let's drink to the new
WPC World Champion, Tommy Vinson.

770
01:16:09,813 --> 01:16:12,912
Thanks for watching.
Until the next season.

771
01:16:13,074 --> 01:16:16,555
May all your pots be enormous.

772
01:16:18,445 --> 01:16:21,434
Wonderful. Thank you.

773
01:16:23,547 --> 01:16:25,609
Not quite even.

774
01:16:27,882 --> 01:16:29,715
Do you mind?

775
01:16:32,409 --> 01:16:35,966
Great playing.
- Me? And what about you?

776
01:16:37,626 --> 01:16:39,840
I got lucky with the cards.

777
01:16:41,462 --> 01:16:43,524
I guess I should thank you.

778
01:16:44,377 --> 01:16:46,407
Why?
You're a natural.

779
01:16:46,564 --> 01:16:50,775
No, not about the cards.
You see that girl in there?

780
01:17:01,295 --> 01:17:03,248
Sorry you didn't win.

781
01:17:03,405 --> 01:17:06,088
I will, someday.

782
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:08,927
I bet you will.

783
01:17:15,566 --> 01:17:19,624
I gotta go.
- Will I see you back next month?

784
01:17:20,092 --> 01:17:23,082
Not a chance.
I'm going to Hawaii

785
01:17:23,238 --> 01:17:24,657
first class.

786
01:17:25,233 --> 01:17:27,993
This was so real.
You're ready.

787
01:17:28,148 --> 01:17:31,749
I might come back in about
25 or 30 years.

788
01:17:43,378 --> 01:17:50,045
Did you have a pair in your hands?
Nines? Tens?

789
01:17:51,281 --> 01:17:54,270
Tens.

790
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:56,951
I knew it.

791
01:17:59,682 --> 01:18:01,559
Goodbye, Tommy.

792
01:18:02,305 --> 01:18:08,431
