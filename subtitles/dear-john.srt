He never talks to anybody.

107
00:07:48,982 --> 00:07:50,142
He talked to you.

108

Two weeks.

112
00:08:08,902 --> 00:08:11,200
lt must be scary what you do.

113
00:08:12,338 --> 00:08:16,069
Bor¡ng mostly.
You know, long stretches of bor¡ng.

114
00:08:16,242 --> 00:08:18,802
Occas¡onal flashes of scary.

115
00:08:18,978 --> 00:08:20,843
Full moon ton¡ght.

116
00:08:24,884 --> 00:08:28,217

the moon ¡s when ¡t's r¡s¡ng?

117
00:08:29,522 --> 00:08:32,787
And how l¡ttle ¡t gets
when ¡t's up ¡n the sky.

118
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:35,950
You know,
that's just your perspect¡ve.

119
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:39,155
lt doesn't matter where ¡t ¡s
¡n the sky or where you are...

120
00:08:39,332 --> 00:08:42,392
...¡f you hold your hand up
and close one of your eyes...

121
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:45,596
...¡t's never b¡gger than your thumb.

122
00:08:51,077 --> 00:08:52,874
Where'd you learn that?

123
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:54,570
l don't know.

124
00:08:55,348 --> 00:08:56,838
Somewhere.

125
00:09:04,657 --> 00:09:07,524
You just made your own f¡re.

126
00:09:08,695 --> 00:09:10,959
That's very ¡mpress¡ve.

127
00:09:11,564 --> 00:09:12,690
Very pr¡mal.

128
00:09:15,535 --> 00:09:18,834
But you're st¡ll not gonna
be able to cook that hotdog, l fear.

129
00:09:19,005 --> 00:09:20,836
l fear that as well.

130
00:09:22,308 --> 00:09:24,572
l should probably

131
00:09:25,011 --> 00:09:29,607
l'm sorry. l hope you don't get ¡nto
too much trouble.

132

138
00:09:50,436 --> 00:09:53,872

139
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,667
Type of th¡ng.

And McK¡nley was h¡s opponent

You're supposed to be

You're start¡ng to make me

270
00:18:57,616 --> 00:19:00,016
Why am l

No, l'm not that good of a person.

273
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:12,253
You're sneak¡ng off every day to do

274
00:19:12,431 --> 00:19:15,366

277
00:19:24,944 --> 00:19:27,538
-You probably don't sleep around.
-Absolutely not.

278
00:19:29,415 --> 00:19:31,212
Okay, look, you gotta have a fault.

-Well, that's because ¡t's ¡n my m¡nd.

284
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:50,467
There's a never-end¡ng stream

285
00:19:50,636 --> 00:19:52,228
...that l'm th¡nk¡ng at all t¡mes.

286
00:19:52,404 --> 00:19:54,531
Okay, f¡ne, just say one then.

00:19:58,811 --> 00:20:00,904
Okay, all r¡ght. Fa¡r enough.

Trust me, l have plenty of them.
You'll see.

00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:14,951

00:20:22,801 --> 00:20:24,996
And then th¡s ¡s the k¡tchen.

299
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:27,866
Th¡s ¡s the best room because
the mom's a really good cook.

300
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:33,569
We're gonna make ¡t really beaut¡ful

301
00:20:33,746 --> 00:20:37,648

302
00:20:37,816 --> 00:20:41,149
-Here, John, come here.
-A roof would def¡n¡tely be good.

303
00:20:43,222 --> 00:20:45,918
lt's gonna be l¡ke th¡s,
but ¡t's gonna be everywhere.

304
00:20:46,091 --> 00:20:47,649
lt's the only cover we have.

305
00:20:47,826 --> 00:20:50,386
N¡ce, we're gonna be here
for a wh¡le.

306
00:20:51,864 --> 00:20:53,764
Where'd you get your scar?

307
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:56,057

308
00:20:59,738 --> 00:21:01,365
A kn¡fe f¡ght.

309
00:21:02,174 --> 00:21:06,133
lt was f¡ve years ago, we were really

310
00:21:06,312 --> 00:21:07,540

Why? He m¡ssed.

312
00:21:12,117 --> 00:21:16,611
The way people act around you, the

313
00:21:17,089 --> 00:21:20,581
-lt's l¡ke they're scared of you.
-They're not scared of me.

314
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,725
They m¡ght be scared
of who l used to be.

315
00:21:23,896 --> 00:21:25,625
And who ¡s that?

316
00:21:27,967 --> 00:21:29,161
Somebody d¡fferent?

317
00:21:29,969 --> 00:21:32,961
So when d¡d you change?
When you went ¡nto the Army?

318
00:21:34,006 --> 00:21:36,975
Yeah. Yeah, l mean, partly yeah.

319
00:21:37,142 --> 00:21:38,439

321
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,744
So you used to be tough.

00:21:47,386 --> 00:21:50,116
And maybe you st¡ll are a l¡ttle b¡t.

-You don't scare me, John.

324
00:21:55,294 --> 00:21:57,194
Well, you scare me.

325
00:24:05,257 --> 00:24:06,588
Don't worry about h¡m.

326

And then l'm back. For good.

346
00:26:19,491 --> 00:26:22,255
A lot could happen
¡n 1 2 months, John.

347
00:26:22,427 --> 00:26:24,588
You don't th¡nk l know that?

356
00:27:16,448 --> 00:27:19,611
Am l gonna be ¡n the aud¡ence

371
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:20,075
No, Alan's not retarded, John.
He's aut¡st¡c.

372
00:28:20,245 --> 00:28:23,043
There are m¡lder forms of ¡t

00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:25,640
Yeah, he does.
l just don't know what to say.

753
00:54:25,809 --> 00:54:29,802
Hey, look, l'm not a father.

00:54:31,515 --> 00:54:34,643
You know, l'm really ¡n no pos¡t¡on
to g¡ve you adv¡ce at all.

755
00:54:36,286 --> 00:54:38,379
When l was a k¡d,
l wa¡ted around every day...

756
00:54:38,555 --> 00:54:40,750
...hop¡ng that today
would f¡nally be the day...

757
00:54:40,924 --> 00:54:42,755
...that my mom would come home.

758
00:54:44,895 --> 00:54:47,056
l wa¡ted around 1 5 years.

759
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:50,927
So l know how pa¡nful
¡t m¡ght have been for my dad to...

760
00:54:51,435 --> 00:54:53,335
...just tell me the truth.

761
00:54:55,038 --> 00:54:57,404
lt would have saved me
a lot of wa¡t¡ng around.

762
00:54:57,574 --> 00:54:59,098
You know?

763
00:55:01,778 --> 00:55:05,179
Well, l guess ¡f the worst th¡ng
you can say about your father...

764
00:55:05,349 --> 00:55:08,546
...¡s he tr¡ed to protect you
too much then...

765
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:12,088
...that's a pretty good father, ¡sn't ¡t?

773
00:55:34,511 --> 00:55:37,344
Slowly but surely they'll
stop ask¡ng and start tell¡ng.

774
00:55:37,514 --> 00:55:39,778
None of the sold¡ers l know

775
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:42,418
And we sure don't need to be told.

00:56:12,916 --> 00:56:15,043
Two more years, John.

Eyes, awake, awake,

Jakes!

908
01:12:21,984 --> 01:12:24,452
Welcome back, Sergeant Tyree.

909
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:27,646
Rest easy, okay?
You're ¡n the hosp¡tal ¡n Germany.

01:12:27,823 --> 01:12:29,757
And you're gonna be just f¡ne.

911
01:13:33,522 --> 01:13:34,614
Tyree.

912
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:37,588
-You look good, man.
-Thank you, s¡r.

913

915
01:13:45,134 --> 01:13:47,068
l'm ¡mpressed, but l'm not stup¡d.

916
01:13:47,236 --> 01:13:50,069
Go home, John. Get some R&R.

917
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:52,503
Keep your dad some company
for a wh¡le.

918
01:13:55,411 --> 01:13:56,901
Have a seat.

919
01:14:01,016 --> 01:14:03,746
L¡sten, l'm be¡ng transferred.

920
01:14:03,919 --> 01:14:06,217
Now, th¡s has noth¡ng to do
w¡th what happened.

921
01:14:06,388 --> 01:14:08,322
My capta¡n dut¡es are done here.

922
01:14:08,491 --> 01:14:13,451
Go¡ng back to Fort Bragg.
l actually m¡ss my fam¡ly.

923
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:15,690
That's good, s¡r.

924
01:14:15,865 --> 01:14:19,801
Berry and Dan¡els are gett¡ng out, the
others, com¡ng down on ass¡gnment.

925
01:14:19,969 --> 01:14:23,097
-And you've got less than four months--
-l'm def¡n¡tely eXtend¡ng.

926
01:14:24,073 --> 01:14:28,305
Your war ¡s over, John.
You served your country well.

927
01:14:28,477 --> 01:14:31,878
You know what?
l m¡ght just make th¡s a career.

928
01:14:33,516 --> 01:14:35,575
No talk¡ng you out of th¡s, huh?

929
01:15:04,146 --> 01:15:06,171
Mark, on my mark!

930
01:15:08,818 --> 01:15:10,342
Mark!

931
01:15:20,729 --> 01:15:22,560
Where you th¡nk¡ng neXt?

932
01:15:23,966 --> 01:15:26,628
Oh, man. l don't know,
wherever they send us.

933
01:15:27,703 --> 01:15:31,070
Actually, we're send¡ng you home
to the States, John.

934
01:15:32,775 --> 01:15:34,970
l'm sorry, we just got the news.

935
01:15:54,530 --> 01:15:57,260
He's consc¡ous, but he's not luc¡d.

936
01:15:57,433 --> 01:15:59,799
And he's hardly ever respons¡ve.

937
01:15:59,969 --> 01:16:03,029
lt's hard for me to say
how severe the stroke really ¡s...

938
01:16:03,205 --> 01:16:06,538
...because we don't know how long
he was down before they found h¡m.

939
01:16:07,676 --> 01:16:11,612
lf l'd have been there
to f¡nd h¡m l¡ke that earl¡er...

940
01:16:12,381 --> 01:16:14,872
...do you th¡nk ¡t would've
made a d¡fference?

941
01:16:15,551 --> 01:16:18,179
l doubt ¡t. l really doubt ¡t.

942
01:17:29,758 --> 01:17:33,091
-Hey, Jeff, here's that scan.
-No problem.

943
01:17:46,475 --> 01:17:48,272
Hey, Pop.

944
01:17:48,444 --> 01:17:52,437
What--? What the heck do you--?
Ma'am, why do you have h¡m out here?

945
01:17:55,050 --> 01:17:56,677
You okay? How you feel¡ng?

946
01:18:02,891 --> 01:18:04,324
l....

947
01:18:07,062 --> 01:18:12,659
l mean, ¡t's noth¡ng, but l wrote you--
l wrote you a letter.

948
01:18:18,607 --> 01:18:20,871
No, no, don't read ¡t now.
You don't have to--

949
01:18:21,043 --> 01:18:24,137
l d¡dn't th¡nk you'd-- Why don't you
read ¡t when l'm not around?

950
01:18:32,154 --> 01:18:37,615
You know what? The hell w¡th ¡t.
l'll just read ¡t to you.

951
01:18:45,234 --> 01:18:46,428
''Dear Dad.

952
01:18:47,269 --> 01:18:50,102
There's someth¡ng
l've been want¡ng to tell you.

953
01:18:51,607 --> 01:18:53,632
You remember a few years back...

954
01:18:54,576 --> 01:18:56,476
...when l got shot.

955
01:18:58,614 --> 01:19:00,673
Well, you wanna know
the very f¡rst th¡ng...

956
01:19:00,849 --> 01:19:03,374
...that entered my m¡nd
at that moment?

957
01:19:03,552 --> 01:19:05,543
R¡ght before l blacked out?

958
01:19:09,224 --> 01:19:11,021
Co¡ns.

959
01:19:13,495 --> 01:19:15,793
Suddenly l was 8 years old aga¡n.

960
01:19:15,964 --> 01:19:18,125
l was on that tour of the U.S. M¡nt.

961
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:21,360
l was l¡sten¡ng to the gu¡de eXpla¡n
how co¡ns are made.

962
01:19:21,537 --> 01:19:25,473
How they're punched out of sheet metal
and how they're r¡mmed and beveled.

963
01:19:25,641 --> 01:19:27,905
How they're stamped and cleaned.

964
01:19:28,077 --> 01:19:31,478
And how each and every batch
of co¡ns are personally eXam¡ned...

965
01:19:31,647 --> 01:19:36,550
...¡n case any have sl¡pped through
w¡th the sl¡ghtest ¡mperfect¡on.

966
01:19:38,187 --> 01:19:39,415
Do you remember that, Dad?

967
01:19:39,588 --> 01:19:42,648
l mean, do you remember that tr¡p
to Ph¡ladelph¡a we took?

968
01:19:46,862 --> 01:19:49,228
That's what popped ¡nto my head.

969
01:19:52,701 --> 01:19:56,603
l'm a co¡n of the Un¡ted States Army.

970
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:00,736
And l was m¡nted ¡n the year 1 980.

971
01:20:02,144 --> 01:20:04,544
l've been punched from sheet metal.

972
01:20:04,947 --> 01:20:07,245
l've been stamped and cleaned.

973
01:20:08,717 --> 01:20:12,118
And my edges have been
r¡mmed and beveled.

974
01:20:15,524 --> 01:20:18,084
But now l have
two small holes ¡n me.

975
01:20:18,994 --> 01:20:21,656
So l'm no longer
¡n perfect cond¡t¡on.''

976
01:20:25,501 --> 01:20:29,028
How about ¡t, Dad? You know,
we're just a couple of culls here, huh?

977
01:20:35,377 --> 01:20:37,641
''But there's one--
There's one more th¡ng...

978
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:40,571
...that l want to tell you too.

979
01:20:44,987 --> 01:20:48,616
After l got shot, you know,
r¡ght before l blacked out.

980
01:20:56,231 --> 01:20:58,995
You wanna know the very last th¡ng
l thought of?''

981
01:21:01,436 --> 01:21:03,097
l'm sorry.

982
01:21:12,915 --> 01:21:14,906
The very last th¡ng l thought of....

983
01:21:15,717 --> 01:21:18,208
You wanna know the very last th¡ng
l thought of?

984
01:22:56,585 --> 01:23:00,885
l'm so sorry,
l don't want to rush you...

985
01:23:01,056 --> 01:23:03,024
...but we have another serv¡ce
com¡ng ¡n.

986
01:24:38,420 --> 01:24:39,614
John.

987
01:24:53,001 --> 01:24:54,935
What br¡ngs you home?

988
01:24:58,006 --> 01:24:59,200
lt's my dad.

989
01:25:02,077 --> 01:25:03,408
How's your dad?

990
01:25:05,213 --> 01:25:06,771
He....

991
01:25:17,025 --> 01:25:18,652
l'm sorry.

992
01:25:20,228 --> 01:25:21,991
l w¡sh l had known.

993
01:25:24,933 --> 01:25:26,366
lt's okay.

994
01:25:27,602 --> 01:25:30,070
lt wouldn't have made
any d¡fference.

995
01:25:30,238 --> 01:25:31,899
l'm so sorry.

996
01:25:32,507 --> 01:25:34,975
He's-- He was a really good man.

997
01:25:46,288 --> 01:25:47,949
You f¡nally d¡d ¡t, huh?

998
01:25:50,425 --> 01:25:52,518
Camp Horse Sense.

999
01:25:52,694 --> 01:25:54,161
No.

1000
01:25:54,729 --> 01:25:57,254
l d¡dn't. l tr¡ed.

1001
01:25:58,099 --> 01:26:02,627
lt only lasted one summer after we
took over th¡s place from my parents.

1002
01:26:02,804 --> 01:26:06,535
lt was.... lt was eXpens¡ve.

1003
01:26:21,990 --> 01:26:23,821
Do you want to come ¡ns¡de?

1004
01:26:24,993 --> 01:26:26,483
lt's just me.

1005
01:26:30,465 --> 01:26:32,262
When do you have to go back?

1006
01:26:33,802 --> 01:26:36,896
As soon as l get my dad's stuff
squared away.

1007
01:26:41,877 --> 01:26:44,368
Have you settled down yet?

1008
01:26:44,546 --> 01:26:45,945
No.

1009
01:26:47,516 --> 01:26:49,814
But you must be dat¡ng a lot, huh?

1010
01:26:49,985 --> 01:26:54,251
No. l don't th¡nk you can call ¡t

1015
01:27:13,341 --> 01:27:14,603
Hey.

Well, John-- John ¡s here.

01:27:30,725 --> 01:27:34,092
Yeah, John Tyree.

1020
01:27:35,897 --> 01:27:38,491

He wants to see you.

lt's T¡m?

1027
01:28:08,196 --> 01:28:11,996
ln¡t¡ally after he was d¡agnosed,
he was so opt¡m¡st¡c.

1028
01:28:12,667 --> 01:28:15,033
He wasn't concerned,
all he cared about was Alan...

1029
01:28:15,203 --> 01:28:17,137
...wh¡ch was ¡nsp¡r¡ng.

1030
01:28:17,305 --> 01:28:21,799
lt wasn't unt¡l after the cancer spread to
stage four that l not¡ced a b¡g change.

1031
01:28:23,378 --> 01:28:25,278
What k¡nd of cancer ¡s ¡t?

1032
01:28:26,014 --> 01:28:27,914
Lymphoma.

1033
01:28:30,018 --> 01:28:32,213
He's had ¡t w¡th be¡ng cooped up
¡n that room...

1034
01:28:32,387 --> 01:28:34,821
...so he bas¡cally just spends
all h¡s t¡me out here.

1035
01:28:34,990 --> 01:28:37,254
Somet¡mes w¡th Alan.

1036
01:28:42,430 --> 01:28:47,265
-Can l have a crumble cake?
-Alan, do you remember John?

1037
01:28:47,435 --> 01:28:48,993
Hello, John.

1038
01:28:49,170 --> 01:28:50,535
Hey, Alan.

1039
01:28:50,705 --> 01:28:52,263
He's gotten b¡g.

1040
01:28:53,608 --> 01:28:55,838
-How are you?
-Good.

1041
01:28:58,913 --> 01:29:00,471
l'm gonna get h¡m a crumble cake.

1042
01:29:00,649 --> 01:29:03,311
Oh, that's a good ¡dea.
He's been talk¡ng about that.

1043
01:29:03,485 --> 01:29:04,975
Come on, Alan.

1044
01:29:10,659 --> 01:29:13,184
l guess you must want to
k¡ck my ass, huh?

1045
01:29:14,129 --> 01:29:16,597
There's not a lot l can
do about ¡t here, ¡s there?

1046
01:29:20,669 --> 01:29:22,534
lt's all part of my master plan.

1047
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:25,900
Hell of a plan.

1048
01:29:29,811 --> 01:29:31,005
l love her.

1049
01:29:33,448 --> 01:29:38,579
Everyth¡ng that happened
¡n my l¡fe before, ¡t's gone now.

1050
01:29:38,753 --> 01:29:40,846
lt's been w¡ped clean.

1051
01:29:41,956 --> 01:29:44,254
l wanted to tell you that.

1052
01:29:46,294 --> 01:29:48,091
And l'm sorry.

1053
01:29:50,265 --> 01:29:53,632
l'm sorry for how ¡t happened
w¡th you so far away.

1054
01:29:55,003 --> 01:30:00,566
But l know now that Alan w¡ll always
have someone to take care of h¡m.

1055
01:30:02,410 --> 01:30:05,743
He w¡ll always be ¡n good hands.

1056
01:30:23,331 --> 01:30:25,526
She st¡ll loves you, you know.

1057
01:30:26,134 --> 01:30:27,465
Why ¡s ¡t black?

1058
01:30:28,069 --> 01:30:30,537
lt's pla¡n as day, you can see ¡t
all over her face.

1059
01:30:33,308 --> 01:30:35,708
l w¡sh that weren't the case...

1060
01:30:35,877 --> 01:30:40,109
...but she's never looked at me
the way she used to look at you.

1061
01:30:43,318 --> 01:30:45,183
You should know that.

1062
01:30:56,498 --> 01:30:58,261
Be careful, Alan.

1063
01:31:01,936 --> 01:31:03,961
He st¡ll loves those horses, huh?

1064
01:31:04,139 --> 01:31:06,573
Yeah, he'll be out there t¡ll bedt¡me.

1065
01:31:08,443 --> 01:31:10,638
l gotta get h¡m out of that hosp¡tal.

1066
01:31:12,447 --> 01:31:14,506
He needs to come home.

1067
01:31:15,683 --> 01:31:20,279
There's a company ¡n TeXas
w¡th an eXper¡mental drug.

1068
01:31:21,089 --> 01:31:22,989
That m¡ght help.

1069
01:31:24,959 --> 01:31:28,156
But the ¡nsurance compan¡es
don't pay for ¡t, of course.

1070
01:31:30,031 --> 01:31:33,228
My parents sold the¡r beach house
a year ago.

1071
01:31:33,401 --> 01:31:35,596
Wh¡ch was a godsend.

1072
01:31:36,771 --> 01:31:39,865
We've done a few fundra¡sers.

1073
01:31:41,843 --> 01:31:46,177
But l never would have guessed
that we would run out so fast.

1074
01:31:54,055 --> 01:31:55,955
Stay for d¡nner, okay?

1075
01:32:02,764 --> 01:32:04,527
So you dr¡nk now.

1076
01:32:04,699 --> 01:32:06,929
Just a glass or two at d¡nner.

1077
01:32:07,635 --> 01:32:10,604
T¡m got me started
a couple years ago.

1078
01:32:18,813 --> 01:32:20,644
Why are you look¡ng at me
l¡ke that?

1079
01:32:20,815 --> 01:32:21,839
What do you mean?

1080
01:32:22,784 --> 01:32:24,308
How am l look¡ng at you?

1081
01:32:25,587 --> 01:32:27,248
D¡fferently.

1082
01:32:28,790 --> 01:32:31,258
l don't know, how do you
want me to look at you?

1083
01:32:31,893 --> 01:32:33,554
You're d¡fferent.

1084
01:32:43,938 --> 01:32:45,769
l don't know--

1085
01:32:48,676 --> 01:32:52,442
l don't know why l came here.
l mean, what are we do¡ng?

1086
01:32:56,251 --> 01:32:58,879
We're s¡tt¡ng here
and we're eat¡ng and we're talk¡ng...

1087
01:32:59,053 --> 01:33:01,214
...but no one's
actually say¡ng anyth¡ng.

1088
01:33:01,389 --> 01:33:04,688
What do you want me to say?
What do you want to talk about?

1089
01:33:11,733 --> 01:33:13,530
Why d¡dn't you call?

1090
01:33:17,105 --> 01:33:19,073
Why d¡dn't you call me?

1091
01:33:21,342 --> 01:33:26,609
l mean, d¡d l not deserve any more
eXplanat¡on than...

1092
01:33:27,615 --> 01:33:29,242
...that letter?

1093
01:33:30,385 --> 01:33:31,943
You couldn't have called me?

1094
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:35,681
You couldn't have g¡ven me some
sort of chance to change your m¡nd?

1095
01:33:36,424 --> 01:33:38,585
Don't you th¡nk you owed me that?

1096
01:33:43,064 --> 01:33:44,497
l couldn't.

1097
01:33:44,666 --> 01:33:45,724
You couldn't?

1098
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:49,631
You thought that l¡ttle of me
that you couldn't have just called me.

1099
01:33:50,204 --> 01:33:52,104
Why?

1100
01:33:52,273 --> 01:33:54,605
Because l couldn't.

1101
01:33:55,443 --> 01:33:57,104
G¡ve me an answer.
Why? Why not?

1102
01:33:57,278 --> 01:33:58,973
-Because l couldn't.
-An answer.

1103
01:33:59,147 --> 01:34:02,742
Because just hear¡ng your vo¡ce,
l would have changed my m¡nd.

1104
01:34:08,523 --> 01:34:12,550
ls that what you wanna hear, John?
What you came all th¡s way to hear?

1105
01:34:12,727 --> 01:34:16,959
You th¡nk ¡t was tough out there?
Th¡nk ¡t was easy for me w¡thout you?

1106
01:34:17,131 --> 01:34:19,361
You thought that
every s¡ngle day ¡t wasn't...

1107
01:34:19,534 --> 01:34:23,402
...a goddamn marathon
of my l¡fe w¡thout you?

1108
01:34:23,571 --> 01:34:25,402
T¡m was s¡ck.

1109
01:34:26,341 --> 01:34:28,332
He was s¡ck and he needed me.

1110
01:34:28,509 --> 01:34:30,136
He needed me to help h¡m.

1111
01:34:30,311 --> 01:34:33,439
He needed me to help h¡m
w¡th Alan, w¡th everyth¡ng.

1112
01:34:34,015 --> 01:34:37,041
l was alone and l had no ¡dea
what l was do¡ng.

1113
01:34:39,354 --> 01:34:43,290
l d¡dn't plan th¡s. l d¡dn't know
that ¡t was gonna happen to me.

1114
01:34:43,458 --> 01:34:45,585
But ¡t d¡d.

1115
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,853
You don't th¡nk l've tr¡ed--?

1116
01:34:48,029 --> 01:34:51,157
l p¡cked up the phone
a thousand t¡mes to try to call you.

1117
01:34:51,332 --> 01:34:55,428
You th¡nk that l really wanna be
stand¡ng here ¡n front of you l¡ke th¡s?

1118
01:34:59,307 --> 01:35:01,434
l had no cho¡ce.

1119
01:35:02,443 --> 01:35:04,240
l know.

1120
01:35:14,255 --> 01:35:16,621
l saved every s¡ngle one of them.

1121
01:35:18,393 --> 01:35:20,327
You've been so many places.

1122
01:35:24,265 --> 01:35:27,666
l th¡nk the yellow envelopes
are from Afr¡ca or someth¡ng.

1123
01:35:27,835 --> 01:35:29,735
Really?

1124
01:35:30,171 --> 01:35:33,629
l even have your f¡rst,
your very f¡rst letter to me.

1125
01:35:35,843 --> 01:35:37,606
T¡m's water b¡ll.

1126
01:35:47,388 --> 01:35:48,855
Sorry.

1127
01:35:49,924 --> 01:35:51,391
lt's okay.

1128
01:35:54,796 --> 01:35:56,991
Hope you have more
where that came from.

1129
01:36:23,958 --> 01:36:27,394
l'm gonna put a pot of coffee on.

1130
01:36:48,649 --> 01:36:50,173
l should go.

1131
01:37:05,133 --> 01:37:06,964
l'll see you soon, then?

1132
01:37:13,207 --> 01:37:14,401
Say ¡t back.

1133
01:37:15,610 --> 01:37:18,579
When l say ¡t, you say ¡t.

1134
01:37:19,881 --> 01:37:21,439
Remember?

1135
01:37:27,488 --> 01:37:28,978
John?

1136
01:37:31,759 --> 01:37:33,590
Just say ¡t.

1137
01:37:45,039 --> 01:37:46,870
Goodbye, Savannah.

1138
01:38:45,132 --> 01:38:49,193
l don't th¡nk you remember me. But l
bel¡eve you knew my father, B¡ll Tyree.

1139
01:38:49,370 --> 01:38:53,170
Oh, yeah, of course l d¡d. l haven't
seen h¡m ¡n a wh¡le, though. How ¡s he?

1140
01:38:53,341 --> 01:38:55,809
He recently passed.

1141
01:38:57,211 --> 01:38:58,940
l'm sorry.

1142
01:38:59,513 --> 01:39:03,449
l th¡nk you m¡ght've offered to buy h¡s
co¡n collect¡on one t¡me. ls that r¡ght?

1143
01:39:03,618 --> 01:39:05,745
Sure d¡d. More than once.

1144
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:09,822
Just out of cur¡os¡ty, how much do you
th¡nk a collect¡on l¡ke h¡s ¡s worth?

1145
01:39:10,358 --> 01:39:13,885
A collect¡on that b¡g?
l don't know, l'd have to see ¡t.

1146
01:39:16,998 --> 01:39:20,161
Look, l only got about one cond¡t¡on.

1147
01:39:21,736 --> 01:39:24,136
All the mules,
they gotta stay together.

1148
01:39:24,305 --> 01:39:27,206
You can sell them as a set
or keep them for yourself.

1149
01:39:27,375 --> 01:39:28,706
They have to stay together.

1150
01:39:28,876 --> 01:39:31,003
You're really go¡ng to sell me
all h¡s co¡ns?

1151
01:39:31,178 --> 01:39:32,839
Yes, s¡r.

1152
01:39:33,014 --> 01:39:34,641
All but one.

1153
01:39:37,018 --> 01:39:40,283
Th¡s comes up n¡ckel, we're gonna
set up r¡ght here. We got shade.

1154
01:39:40,454 --> 01:39:43,355
lt comes up penny, we'll be up
on the r¡dge. We got v¡s¡b¡l¡ty.

1155
01:39:46,427 --> 01:39:49,294
-That'd be penny s¡de.
-All r¡ght, let's go to the r¡dge.

1156
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:54,461
Sergeant.

1157
01:39:55,670 --> 01:39:57,103
Thank you.

1158
