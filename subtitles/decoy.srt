00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,995
Morning, friend. Say, it looks like we're...

3
00:03:40,536 --> 00:03:43,664
Driving all the way into San Francisco.
Going that far?

4
00:04:06,696 --> 00:04:09,529
Now I remember the end of that story.

5
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,897
The other Scotchman says, he says,

6
00:04:11,968 --> 00:04:13,833
"Well, since it's a long story,

7
00:04:13,903 --> 00:04:15,962
"we might as well blow out the..."

8
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,374
"Candle," he says.

9
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,259
- Sixth floor, quick!
- Okay, okay, mister.

10
00:05:44,327 --> 00:05:46,352
- What's all the rush?
- Get going.

11
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:54,129
Oh, Dr. Craig.
You've come to see Miss Shelby off.

12
00:05:55,471 --> 00:05:56,460
No.

13
00:05:59,175 --> 00:06:00,506
I've come to take her with me.

14
00:06:12,221 --> 00:06:14,451
You'll find a couple of cops
in the car downstairs.

15
00:06:14,524 --> 00:06:18,221
- Send one of them for an ambulance.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Right away!

16
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,660
Jo Jo.

17
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,625
- Hello, Jo Jo.
- Hello, kid.

18
00:07:44,614 --> 00:07:46,707
The box. The box!

19
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,681
- Take it easy.
- There it is.

20
00:07:49,752 --> 00:07:52,186
Give it to me. I want it.

21
00:07:52,255 --> 00:07:54,450
- All right.
- I want it.

22
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:57,516
Give it to me! I want it!

23
00:08:05,034 --> 00:08:07,730
Careful, you'll cut yourself.
That iron's rusty.

24
00:08:08,504 --> 00:08:13,271
Careful? That's funny. You're funny, Jo Jo.

25
00:08:15,611 --> 00:08:18,808
It's broken. He broke it.

26
00:08:18,881 --> 00:08:24,183
He shouldn't have done it.
It's mine, it's all mine now.

27
00:08:27,456 --> 00:08:30,482
Everything's mixed up.

28
00:08:31,527 --> 00:08:34,018
What mixes things up,

29
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,859
Jo Jo?

30
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,730
Simple arithmetic, kid. Remember?

31
00:08:39,535 --> 00:08:42,629
Yes, simple arithmetic.

32
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,932
You're laughing at me.

33
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,872
You rotten...

34
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,138
Oh, I hurt inside.

35
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,020
Simple arithmetic.

36
00:09:01,157 --> 00:09:02,249
Yes.

37
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:06,289
One and one make two.

38
00:09:09,398 --> 00:09:10,990
I wanted money.

39
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,999
Frankie Olins had it.

40
00:09:15,338 --> 00:09:18,466
He took it from a shiny red bank truck

41
00:09:19,275 --> 00:09:21,300
two days before Christmas.

42
00:09:22,845 --> 00:09:25,211
$400,000.

43
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,241
Only,

44
00:09:28,751 --> 00:09:31,743
before he could take it,

45
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,880
he had to kill the driver.

46
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,284
<i>Frankie was in jail now.</i>

47
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,921
<i>The people of the State of California</i>
<i>said he had to die.</i>

48
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,795
<i>But only Frankie knew</i>
<i>where the money was hidden.</i>

49
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:46,460
- And he'll be three next Saturday.
- That's swell.

50
00:09:46,535 --> 00:09:47,763
It seems just yesterday...

51
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:51,933
We get to practice baseball twice
a week now. Isn't that great, Pop?

52
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:55,171
Get hold of Vincent,
tell him O'Hara's no good.

53
00:09:55,244 --> 00:09:57,178
Tell him I want
a new mouthpiece for the appeal.

54
00:09:57,246 --> 00:09:59,043
The best mouthpiece in the world.

55
00:09:59,115 --> 00:10:01,743
That takes money, Frankie, a lot of money.

56
00:10:01,817 --> 00:10:03,785
Tell Vince to lay it out.

57
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,481
He told me he laid out 30,000 already.

58
00:10:06,555 --> 00:10:08,648
Have you been seeing Jim Vincent?

59
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:12,455
No, Frankie boy, of course not.

60
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:15,656
He just phoned.
Said he was running short.

61
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,130
Frankie, we may need
part of that bank money to get...

62
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,191
Forget it.

63
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,397
The secret of where that money is
doesn't walk out of here

64
00:10:23,472 --> 00:10:26,134
unless I walk out with it.

65
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,903
Listen, baby.

66
00:10:27,977 --> 00:10:30,639
You don't think I care anything
about that money, do you?

67
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,010
No.

68
00:10:32,081 --> 00:10:34,208
You're the only thing I care about.

69
00:10:34,283 --> 00:10:36,148
That's all that money means to me, you!

70
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,277
Clothes for you, pretty things for you.

71
00:10:38,354 --> 00:10:40,515
That's why I did it,
that's why I took the chance,

72
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:42,955
even on a murder rap,

73
00:10:43,025 --> 00:10:45,892
because I want you to be beautiful for me.

74
00:10:45,961 --> 00:10:49,419
For me. Not for anybody else, just me.

75
00:10:49,498 --> 00:10:51,693
All right, time's up.

76
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:55,931
Come on, come on, you'll see him again.
He ain't going anywhere.

77
00:10:56,005 --> 00:10:59,805
Listen, Margot, honey.
Tell Vince he's gotta get up that dough.

78
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,706
You gotta go now, lady. Time's up.

79
00:11:01,777 --> 00:11:05,213
He knows he'll get it back.
I'll make it worth his while.

80
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:07,613
I'll get out on appeal. I'll get out.

81
00:11:07,683 --> 00:11:10,481
- Goodbye, Frankie darling.
- So long, honey.

82
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,884
<i>Frankie was kidding himself.</i>
<i>He was through.</i>

83
00:11:18,794 --> 00:11:21,388
<i>And when he went,</i>
<i>the money would go with him.</i>

84
00:11:21,997 --> 00:11:23,692
<i>Unless...</i>

85
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:27,862
<i>There was still one small chance,</i>
<i>a long shot.</i>

86
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,770
<i>Something I had read about</i>
<i>a long time ago.</i>

87
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,536
<i>Something I hadn't mentioned before.</i>

88
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:36,976
<i>Something called Methylene Blue.</i>

89
00:11:37,813 --> 00:11:39,974
Yes, Methylene Blue.

90
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:41,175
What kind of stuff is it?

91
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,684
- It's a sort of chemical...
- Hold it.

92
00:11:52,895 --> 00:11:53,919
It's the stuff they use

93
00:11:53,996 --> 00:11:56,726
when there's been an accident
in a laboratory somewhere.

94
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,664
Is this straight? How does it work?

95
00:11:58,734 --> 00:12:00,827
I don't know that.
We'll have to get a doctor.

96
00:12:00,903 --> 00:12:04,430
But I do know this,
Frankie's appeal doesn't stand a chance,

97
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,373
and in California
that means the gas chamber.

98
00:12:07,443 --> 00:12:10,742
They'll execute him with something
they call hydrocyanic gas,

99
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:14,078
and the antidote
for that is Methylene Blue.

100
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,516
- What's the catch?
- The catch?

101
00:12:16,585 --> 00:12:19,213
It'll cost plenty and it's a long shot.

102
00:12:20,222 --> 00:12:22,349
We'll have to find a doctor
who's willing to risk it,

103
00:12:22,425 --> 00:12:25,917
we'll have to get Frankie to him
within an hour after the execution,

104
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,657
and we've got to make sure
there's no autopsy performed.

105
00:12:28,731 --> 00:12:31,427
Who's gonna pick up the body?
Frankie's got no relatives.

106
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,866
Add another $5,000 to the bill.

107
00:12:33,936 --> 00:12:35,927
Yeah? And who pays off?

108
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,496
Frankie, if it works.

109
00:12:38,574 --> 00:12:40,098
And if it doesn't?

110
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:18,178
Oh, I know, two slugs.

111
00:13:22,618 --> 00:13:25,052
Well, let's drink to your future, huh?

112
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:31,453
Look, honey, I spoke to Harry.

113
00:13:31,527 --> 00:13:33,495
I think he'll find a spot in the show for you.

114
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,860
Oh, that would be wonderful.

115
00:13:35,931 --> 00:13:37,990
Please, Sarge, no trouble.

116
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,558
He's kind of nasty
when he's been drinking.

117
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:44,467
Why don't you keep
that two-bit hood out of here?

118
00:13:50,813 --> 00:13:54,112
Come here, Ruthie.
I want you to meet an old friend of mine.

119
00:13:55,184 --> 00:14:00,178
Well, well, if it ain't Little Boy Blue
throwing his buffalos around.

120
00:14:01,357 --> 00:14:05,760
Here he is, Ruthie.
Jo Jo, the wonder boy himself.

121
00:14:05,828 --> 00:14:08,626
The best dressed flatfoot in town.

122
00:14:16,705 --> 00:14:17,763
Come here.

123
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,009
- Yes, sir.
- Put her in a cab.

124
00:14:21,076 --> 00:14:22,202
Okay.

125
00:14:23,245 --> 00:14:25,611
I told you not to play with babies.

126
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,813
Don't call me Jo Jo. The name is Joseph.

127
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,509
Beat it.

128
00:14:38,694 --> 00:14:40,594
I'm closing you up, Mike.

129
00:14:40,663 --> 00:14:42,688
It ain't our fault, Sarge. Honest, it ain't.

130
00:14:42,765 --> 00:14:43,925
Kelsey brought her in here.

131
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:47,332
Louie asked her how old she was,
she said 23.

132
00:14:47,403 --> 00:14:51,601
- If she's 20, I'll eat that glass.
- Well, Kelsey brought her in.

133
00:14:51,674 --> 00:14:54,768
Okay, okay.
But if I catch you selling liquor to minors,

134
00:14:54,843 --> 00:14:57,835
I'll bust this joint into toothpicks.

135
00:14:57,913 --> 00:15:01,110
Oh, no, that's all right, Sarge.
It's on the house. It's a pleasure.

136
00:15:01,183 --> 00:15:02,309
Take it.

137
00:15:20,869 --> 00:15:23,337
Playing the second team, kid?

138
00:15:23,405 --> 00:15:27,068
- Frankie mightn't like it.
- What's on your mind, Jo Jo?

139
00:15:27,142 --> 00:15:29,406
A few hundred thousand dollars.

140
00:15:29,478 --> 00:15:31,742
Why not talk to Frankie Olins about it?

141
00:15:31,814 --> 00:15:33,111
I'd rather talk to you.

142
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,275
I've already told you
I don't know anything.

143
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,013
Why don't you stop
trying to push her around, you...

144
00:15:38,087 --> 00:15:39,179
What?

145
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,559
I thought when I got Frankie
you'd have sense enough

146
00:15:44,627 --> 00:15:47,095
to climb up off the trash heap.

147
00:15:47,162 --> 00:15:49,528
- To your level?
- There's worse.

148
00:15:51,266 --> 00:15:54,463
Do they have this kind of trash
on your level, Jo Jo?

149
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,003
No.

150
00:15:56,071 --> 00:15:58,096
Don't have this kind either.

151
00:15:58,173 --> 00:16:00,698
Someday you're gonna
go too far, Portugal.

152
00:16:00,776 --> 00:16:02,004
Uh-huh.

153
00:16:02,077 --> 00:16:04,443
When I do, I'll be coming after you.

154
00:16:10,185 --> 00:16:12,745
I'd like to skin that flatfoot.

155
00:16:12,821 --> 00:16:15,619
- His skin's pretty tough, Vince.
- Maybe.

156
00:16:16,825 --> 00:16:18,793
I'm gonna find out someday.

157
00:16:19,762 --> 00:16:21,730
Well, what about Frankie?

158
00:16:21,797 --> 00:16:23,924
- What about him?
- That's up to you.

159
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:28,362
Look, honey, that appeal ran me 15Gs.

160
00:16:28,437 --> 00:16:32,168
That means that altogether
I've got 45 grand invested in that guy.

161
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,765
You'll get it back

162
00:16:33,842 --> 00:16:35,605
if we get Frankie out.

163
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:38,078
I'm not so sure I want to get him out.

164
00:16:38,147 --> 00:16:41,275
$45,000 is a lot of money.

165
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,908
Maybe I don't mind losing it.

166
00:16:42,985 --> 00:16:45,283
Well, which is it?

167
00:16:45,354 --> 00:16:48,585
Me or your $45,000?

168
00:16:48,657 --> 00:16:50,022
I don't know.

169
00:16:52,027 --> 00:16:53,517
I don't know.

170
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,995
Maybe I might wind up with both.

171
00:17:00,703 --> 00:17:05,140
<i>Jim Vincent was tough</i>
<i>and shifty, like an alley cat,</i>

172
00:17:05,207 --> 00:17:08,005
<i>and about as hard to handle.</i>

173
00:17:08,077 --> 00:17:11,740
<i>But if I wanted Frankie out of jail,</i>
<i>I needed help,</i>

174
00:17:11,814 --> 00:17:14,078
<i>and Vincent was willing.</i>

175
00:17:14,149 --> 00:17:16,640
<i>Simple arithmetic it was.</i>

176
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:18,482
<i>Step one was finished.</i>

177
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:28,692
<i>It was now time for step two.</i>

178
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,202
Good morning. Can I help you?

179
00:17:43,278 --> 00:17:46,611
- Is Dr. Craig in?
- Yes. Come in, please.

180
00:17:56,391 --> 00:17:58,018
Is it anything serious?

181
00:17:58,093 --> 00:18:01,324
You see, the doctor is asleep right now.
Of course, if it's terribly important...

182
00:18:01,396 --> 00:18:05,389
Oh, no, no. I understand.
Don't wake him. It's just a shoulder pain.

183
00:18:05,467 --> 00:18:08,027
Doctors don't have much chance to rest,
do they?

184
00:18:08,103 --> 00:18:09,468
Dr. Craig doesn't.

185
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:12,200
There's a lot of work in this neighborhood.
Then there's the free clinic

186
00:18:12,274 --> 00:18:15,004
and, of course, two days a week
at the state prison.

187
00:18:15,077 --> 00:18:17,272
There was an execution
at the prison late last night

188
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,314
and he's the officiating doctor.

189
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:21,508
Well, what would be the best time?

190
00:18:23,952 --> 00:18:25,681
I couldn't sleep...

191
00:18:27,389 --> 00:18:30,688
- I'm sorry.
- This is Miss...

192
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,989
Shelby, Margot Shelby.

193
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:34,460
How do you do, Miss Shelby?

194
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,998
Miss Shelby's been waiting to see you.

195
00:18:37,065 --> 00:18:38,430
Won't you come in?

196
00:18:41,403 --> 00:18:44,497
- What seems to be the trouble?
- It's my shoulder, doctor.

197
00:18:44,573 --> 00:18:46,302
It aches a little.

198
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,379
<i>I thought Lloyd Craig</i>
<i>would be easy,</i>

199
00:18:58,453 --> 00:19:00,887
<i>but only part of him reached out to me.</i>

200
00:19:00,956 --> 00:19:02,583
<i>The other part clung desperately</i>

201
00:19:02,658 --> 00:19:05,786
<i>to the ideals that</i>
<i>have driven him all his life.</i>

202
00:19:05,861 --> 00:19:09,729
<i>Ideals that have sent him into the slums</i>
<i>to heal the poor.</i>

203
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:13,859
<i>Ideals so strong they've become</i>
<i>a shield against his poverty,</i>

204
00:19:13,936 --> 00:19:16,063
<i>his bitter Ioneliness.</i>

205
00:19:16,138 --> 00:19:18,299
<i>I had to smash that shield.</i>

206
00:19:18,373 --> 00:19:22,002
<i>I had to. I had to. I had to.</i>

207
00:19:36,892 --> 00:19:38,120
Darling?

208
00:19:39,194 --> 00:19:42,425
What's the matter? You look so unhappy.

209
00:19:42,497 --> 00:19:45,295
Oh, that. Don't think about it now.

210
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:48,359
I can't think of anything else.
Day and night I...

211
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,699
Give me a cigarette.

212
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:52,033
Please.

213
00:20:06,889 --> 00:20:09,119
Look, Margot. No, don't interrupt me.

214
00:20:09,191 --> 00:20:11,125
I've got to talk about it now.

215
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:17,828
- I can't go through with it.
- You don't have to, dear.

216
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,698
- But I thought you said...
- I've been thinking about it, too.

217
00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:23,897
I can't stand watching you
fight yourself this way.

218
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,371
I don't want to hurt you.

219
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,000
I don't want to do anything
that's going to make you unhappy.

220
00:20:28,076 --> 00:20:29,668
And us?

221
00:20:29,745 --> 00:20:32,646
- What about us?
- What can there be about us?

222
00:20:32,714 --> 00:20:34,045
What do you mean?

223
00:20:34,116 --> 00:20:37,142
- What about all our plans?
- Our plans?

224
00:20:37,219 --> 00:20:39,483
Why do you think
I want you to save Frankie?

225
00:20:39,554 --> 00:20:41,681
Do you think
I'd care whether he's alive or dead?

226
00:20:41,757 --> 00:20:44,555
Not a bit. It meant money for us.

227
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,458
It meant being together, you and I.

228
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:50,589
- That's what I cared about.
- We can still be married.

229
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,566
I have my practice, I have my prison work.

230
00:20:52,634 --> 00:20:55,762
- We can start together and...
- No, I couldn't, Lloyd.

231
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:58,567
- I just couldn't.
- You said you loved me.

232
00:21:00,042 --> 00:21:02,806
Do you remember the first time
I came to see you in your office?

233
00:21:02,878 --> 00:21:06,041
Your dingy, gloomy office
in that dingy, dirty street,

234
00:21:06,114 --> 00:21:08,014
the rotten smell
from the factory chimneys

235
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,278
pressing down on
the shabby little houses?

236
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:13,344
The slovenly old women,
the gray-faced, dirty little children,

237
00:21:13,422 --> 00:21:15,356
starting out with
everything against them?

238
00:21:15,424 --> 00:21:17,051
I remember that street.

239
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,153
- Do you love me?
- Yes.

240
00:21:19,227 --> 00:21:21,661
But I can't forget your street.

241
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,925
I remember every little thing about it.

242
00:21:23,999 --> 00:21:27,264
And if I had never seen it,
I still could have described it

243
00:21:27,336 --> 00:21:29,930
because that street
runs all over the world.

244
00:21:30,005 --> 00:21:33,065
I know because
that's the street I came from,

245
00:21:33,742 --> 00:21:37,542
6,000 miles from here
in a little English mill town.

246
00:21:38,513 --> 00:21:42,279
But it's the same rotten street,
the same factories, the same people,

247
00:21:42,351 --> 00:21:45,980
and the same
dirty little gray-faced children.

248
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,385
I need you.

249
00:21:47,456 --> 00:21:48,855
Oh, it's no use, Lloyd.

250
00:21:48,924 --> 00:21:51,552
I can't go back to that
sick, unhealthy street,

251
00:21:51,626 --> 00:21:53,059
the street I came from.

252
00:21:53,128 --> 00:21:55,562
I can't go back to it. I can't, Lloyd, I won't.

253
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:58,463
And I can't leave it. I'm a doctor.

254
00:21:58,533 --> 00:22:01,229
I've been trained to face things
that are sick and unhealthy,

255
00:22:01,303 --> 00:22:03,567
to make them better,
not to run away from them.

256
00:22:03,638 --> 00:22:06,471
And that's what you're trying to do,
run away, run away from reality.

257
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:09,101
Reality? What do you know about reality?

258
00:22:09,177 --> 00:22:13,136
You like the clothes I wear, don't you?
You like to smell the perfume I use.

259
00:22:13,215 --> 00:22:14,944
You like that, don't you?

260
00:22:15,017 --> 00:22:17,918
That perfume costs $75 a bottle.

261
00:22:17,986 --> 00:22:19,749
Seventy-five dollars.

262
00:22:19,821 --> 00:22:23,086
That's as much as you earn in a week
of sopping up running noses.

263
00:22:23,158 --> 00:22:25,854
A bottle of perfume, that's our reality.

264
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,621
I can't do it your way.

265
00:22:30,699 --> 00:22:32,166
That's what I said.

266
00:22:53,221 --> 00:22:55,280
Doctor Craig's office.

267
00:22:55,357 --> 00:22:57,825
No, he hasn't come in yet.

268
00:22:57,893 --> 00:23:00,919
I couldn't say, he's usually in before this.

269
00:23:00,996 --> 00:23:04,329
Yes, I'll have him call you. Yes. Goodbye.

270
00:23:06,234 --> 00:23:08,225
Here, blow. Blow hard.

271
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,237
What did you say
your address was, Mrs. Noonan?

272
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,863
Three hundred...

273
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,034
- Oh, good morning, Doctor.
- Good morning, Doctor.

274
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,339
Excuse me a moment, Mrs. Noonan.

275
00:23:29,057 --> 00:23:31,287
Mr. Pelletti's been waiting since 8:00.

276
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:33,293
He thinks his arm is worse.

277
00:23:33,795 --> 00:23:35,660
I don't know who the girl is.

278
00:23:36,064 --> 00:23:38,931
Mrs. Noonan,
the lady with the boy, is new, too.

279
00:23:39,468 --> 00:23:41,299
And Dr. Jones at the clinic
has been calling

280
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:43,166
and wants you to phone him.

281
00:23:46,441 --> 00:23:48,932
- Here's your call list.
- Save it for later.

282
00:23:54,716 --> 00:23:56,877
Send Pelletti in first.

283
00:23:56,952 --> 00:23:59,147
Lloyd, what's troubling you?

284
00:23:59,221 --> 00:24:01,883
You look as if you hadn't slept for days.

285
00:24:01,957 --> 00:24:04,289
Why don't you talk to me anymore?

286
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,424
- Aren't you listening?
- What?

287
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,663
What did you say?

288
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:11,658
Nothing.

289
00:24:17,973 --> 00:24:20,635
Mr. Pelletti, the doctor will see you now.

290
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,883
Now, Mrs. Noonan,
what did you say your address was?

291
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,252
- But, Doctor...
- I don't care.

292
00:24:37,325 --> 00:24:38,917
Let someone else deliver his papers.

293
00:24:38,994 --> 00:24:41,360
He's got to stay in bed at least a week.

294
00:24:41,429 --> 00:24:43,795
All right, Doctor. Thank you very much.

295
00:24:43,865 --> 00:24:45,196
Thank you.

296
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,471
Do you want your call list now?

297
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:02,244
- Tear it up.
- What?

298
00:25:02,317 --> 00:25:03,909
You heard what I said.

299
00:25:04,386 --> 00:25:07,184
If any more patients come in,
tell them I've gone away for the weekend.

300
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:09,314
But, Lloyd, you can't.

301
00:25:09,391 --> 00:25:12,918
Darling, what's happened to you?
You've never acted like this before.

302
00:25:12,994 --> 00:25:14,188
What do you mean,
what's happened to me?

303
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:17,129
Nothing's happened to me.
I'm tired, that's all.

304
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:20,600
Tired of patients, tired of my work,
tired of this shabby neighborhood.

305
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:22,296
And are you tired of...

306
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,865
No, I won't give you a chance to say it.

307
00:25:32,547 --> 00:25:34,310
Good night, Lloyd.

308
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,010
Darling?

309
00:26:50,091 --> 00:26:53,288
That's why I asked to have
you brought here first, Miss Shelby.

310
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:54,350
Guard.

311
00:26:54,429 --> 00:26:57,227
He won't speak to me,
refuses even to see me,

312
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:59,995
and there are so few precious hours left.

313
00:27:00,068 --> 00:27:03,231
If you could only make him realize...

314
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:14,776
Here we are.

315
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,512
Hello, Frankie.

316
00:27:27,696 --> 00:27:28,685
Margot.

317
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:32,130
- What time is it?
- 5:00.

318
00:27:32,634 --> 00:27:34,261
Three more hours.

319
00:27:35,603 --> 00:27:38,037
Come here, baby. I want to look at you.

320
00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:43,004
New dress you got, isn't it?

321
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,569
And the gloves and the shoes.

322
00:27:45,647 --> 00:27:47,444
And that silly little hat.

323
00:27:48,516 --> 00:27:52,384
Oh, you're beautiful, Margot. So beautiful.

324
00:27:53,188 --> 00:27:55,588
You're the only thing I hate to leave.

325
00:27:56,391 --> 00:27:58,655
Maybe you won't have to, Frankie.

326
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,425
What do you mean?

327
00:28:00,862 --> 00:28:02,352
Listen, and don't interrupt.

328
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,261
And I don't understand.

329
00:28:04,332 --> 00:28:06,391
What is it that makes them
willing to die without...

330
00:28:06,468 --> 00:28:07,992
Yes, sir.

331
00:28:08,069 --> 00:28:09,764
Yes? Yes, what?

332
00:28:09,838 --> 00:28:11,430
Oh, well... That is...

333
00:28:11,506 --> 00:28:13,906
So, see the Chaplain, Frankie.

334
00:28:16,811 --> 00:28:20,577
Father, you can go in now. He'll see you.

335
00:29:43,565 --> 00:29:45,499
D- I, di.

336
00:29:45,567 --> 00:29:47,762
C- H-O-T, shot.

337
00:29:47,836 --> 00:29:50,100
O- M-Y. Dishotomy.

338
00:29:52,841 --> 00:29:54,468
Ain't that a lulu?

339
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:57,636
And get this one, didactic.

340
00:29:59,314 --> 00:30:02,181
Hey, why don't you stop reading that junk?

341
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,047
What's the matter with the dictionary?

342
00:30:04,118 --> 00:30:06,177
There ain't enough story to it.

343
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,825
All right, boys, bring him in.

344
00:30:18,766 --> 00:30:21,462
- Anything else, Doc?
- That's all, thanks.

345
00:30:30,979 --> 00:30:34,938
- Okay, wrap him up.
- Hey, Doc, what about the autopsy?

346
00:30:36,117 --> 00:30:39,553
- What have I done now?
- You would have to bring that up.

347
00:30:39,621 --> 00:30:41,282
We can skip it tonight, boys.

348
00:30:41,356 --> 00:30:45,019
There's somebody waiting for me
and it's kind of late.

349
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,492
Okay, Doc.

350
00:30:46,561 --> 00:30:48,153
Come on and help me with the box, Benny.

351
00:30:48,229 --> 00:30:49,753
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you.

352
00:30:49,831 --> 00:30:50,889
Oh.

353
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:35,839
No, not like that.

354
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:40,313
How many times do I have to tell you?
Fold it like this.

355
00:31:41,215 --> 00:31:43,342
Now, what's wrong
with the way I'm doing it?

356
00:31:43,418 --> 00:31:46,649
Benny, don't be obfuscatory.

357
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,691
- Call Pete.
- Who, me?

358
00:31:54,762 --> 00:31:56,753
- Yeah, you.
- Oh.

359
00:31:57,432 --> 00:32:00,060
- Nice and tidy, Doc.
- Hey, Pete!

360
00:32:00,134 --> 00:32:01,726
Okay for the pick up.

361
00:32:24,626 --> 00:32:26,617
Here's the order for cremation.

362
00:32:29,497 --> 00:32:31,795
- All right, Pete.
- That'll be all for tonight, Doc?

363
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:34,334
That's all, boys, thank you. Good night.

364
00:32:34,402 --> 00:32:36,302
- Good night.
- Good night, Doc.

365
00:32:37,805 --> 00:32:41,798
Dishotomy, what a beautiful word.

366
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,734
Dishotomy.

367
00:32:44,345 --> 00:32:45,607
Chotomy.

368
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,880
Hi. Got another oven job.

369
00:33:07,635 --> 00:33:09,000
All right, Pete.

370
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:10,860
Okay, open them up.

371
00:34:00,822 --> 00:34:02,084
- Everything okay?
- Perfect.

372
00:34:02,156 --> 00:34:04,420
They're gonna put him in the oven.
I've got the orders in my pocket.

373
00:34:04,492 --> 00:34:06,357
Good. Get moving, quick.

374
00:34:25,012 --> 00:34:26,843
- Here's your dough.
- Yeah, thank you.

375
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:33,819
Thanks, Mr. Vincent.

376
00:34:33,888 --> 00:34:36,186
- Now beat it and keep your mouth shut.
- Hey, wait a minute!

377
00:34:36,257 --> 00:34:38,487
Where's the body
you was gonna switch for Olins?

378
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:40,720
- Shut up, you.
- No, where is it? You promised me.

379
00:34:40,795 --> 00:34:45,232
I gotta deliver a body to the crematorium.
I'll be in a spot, Mr. Vincent.

380
00:34:52,373 --> 00:34:53,772
There's his body.

381
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,099
Let's go.

382
00:35:28,576 --> 00:35:29,975
Come on, let's go.

383
00:35:53,034 --> 00:35:55,002
All right, put him over there.

384
00:35:56,838 --> 00:35:59,705
- Did you lock the door?
- Yes. Don't worry about it.

385
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:03,240
Okay.

386
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,546
Here's yours.

387
00:36:10,785 --> 00:36:12,912
It's worth more.

388
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:19,693
Well, I guess Pete won't be needing this.

389
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,358
Here's another five. Split it.

390
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,988
Okay, Vince.

391
00:36:24,365 --> 00:36:25,730
Now, get out.

392
00:36:31,539 --> 00:36:32,528
Well?

393
00:36:34,008 --> 00:36:35,908
Sure, sure, we're going.

394
00:36:56,697 --> 00:36:59,962
- Anything I can do to help, Doc?
- Yes, be quiet.

395
00:38:17,912 --> 00:38:19,345
Strap that ankle.

396
00:40:04,852 --> 00:40:06,149
Reflex hammer.

397
00:40:22,903 --> 00:40:24,200
Lloyd, you've done it!

398
00:40:24,271 --> 00:40:26,671
- You've saved him! Oh, darling!
- Keep quiet.

399
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:31,508
There's blankets in the closet.

400
00:40:54,635 --> 00:40:56,159
He's coming to.

401
00:43:24,985 --> 00:43:26,452
I'm alive.

402
00:43:27,221 --> 00:43:28,688
I'm alive!

403
00:43:31,725 --> 00:43:34,751
Margot, baby.

404
00:43:35,896 --> 00:43:38,490
- Wait in the other room, Doc.
- What for?

405
00:43:38,565 --> 00:43:41,056
I wanna talk to Frankie. Go on outside.

406
00:43:41,135 --> 00:43:43,933
- He's in no condition to talk now.
- Get out.

407
00:43:44,004 --> 00:43:46,302
Please, just for a few minutes.

408
00:44:01,822 --> 00:44:03,790
It's all right now, Frankie boy.

409
00:44:03,857 --> 00:44:05,950
Everything's all right now.

410
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,594
Yeah, it's all right now, isn't it?

411
00:44:08,662 --> 00:44:11,563
I'm alive, Margot. Alive.

412
00:44:13,434 --> 00:44:15,800
Everything's okay now.

413
00:44:24,978 --> 00:44:26,707
Cigarette, Frankie?

414
00:44:28,048 --> 00:44:29,743
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

415
00:44:53,374 --> 00:44:56,275
You've been a good boy, Jim.
I won't forget it.

416
00:45:07,221 --> 00:45:09,485
Everything else I want to forget.

417
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,451
We'll go someplace, someplace far away.

418
00:45:15,529 --> 00:45:17,997
I got dough, plenty of it.
And we'll go now, right now.

419
00:45:18,065 --> 00:45:20,590
- Jim, get me a car and some...
- Snap out of it, Frankie.

420
00:45:20,667 --> 00:45:22,760
- Snap out of what?
- Do you think I'm crazy?

421
00:45:22,836 --> 00:45:26,397
There are 5,000 cops in this state
who know your face as well as their own.

422
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:28,441
- She's right, Frankie.
- Who asked you?

423
00:45:28,509 --> 00:45:30,534
Stop it, Frankie. You know it's true.

424
00:45:30,611 --> 00:45:33,546
- We'd be picked up in an hour.
- Maybe.

425
00:45:36,517 --> 00:45:37,609
What's on your mind?

426
00:45:37,684 --> 00:45:41,120
Simply this, you've got to get a new
face, a face nobody'll ever recognize.

427
00:45:41,188 --> 00:45:42,985
- Yeah, but...
- Wait a minute. It's all set.

428
00:45:43,056 --> 00:45:44,921
We've got a plastic surgeon
who's gonna do the job.

429
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,619
It'll take about three weeks.

430
00:45:46,693 --> 00:45:49,389
You can stay here meanwhile,
but we've got to work fast.

431
00:45:49,463 --> 00:45:51,294
What are we waiting for? Get him.

432
00:45:51,365 --> 00:45:55,529
- It'll cost $25,000, Frankie.
- So what?

433
00:45:55,602 --> 00:45:58,298
It'll have to come out of that money
you've got put away.

434
00:45:58,372 --> 00:46:02,502
Nothing comes out of that money,
until I take it out myself.

435
00:46:03,977 --> 00:46:05,774
Vince'll pay for the doctor.

436
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:08,406
I'm into you for sixty Gs already.

437
00:46:08,482 --> 00:46:11,076
60,000? For what?

438
00:46:11,151 --> 00:46:14,518
Do you want an itemized account
of what it cost to save your life?

439
00:46:17,324 --> 00:46:18,757
Lay out the dough, Vince.

440
00:46:18,826 --> 00:46:21,260
You know you'll get it back
as soon as I can get out of here.

441
00:46:22,262 --> 00:46:23,786
No soap, Frankie.

442
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:25,695
You've just been gassed.

443
00:46:25,766 --> 00:46:27,927
How do I know
what kind of shape you're in?

444
00:46:28,001 --> 00:46:31,266
Maybe you wouldn't be able
to pull through an operation.

445
00:46:31,338 --> 00:46:34,000
What are you trying to say, Jimmy boy?

446
00:46:34,074 --> 00:46:36,440
I got 60 grand coming to me now.

447
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:38,876
I can't afford to take a chance.

448
00:46:38,946 --> 00:46:41,141
You better dig up that dough.

449
00:46:43,083 --> 00:46:45,643
You think I'm going to die, too, huh?

450
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:48,654
No, darling. No, of course not.

451
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:53,159
It's just that if... If Vince is right,
if something did happen to you,

452
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,821
what would become of me?
What would I do?

453
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:58,262
You've got to think about me, too.

454
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:01,626
Why don't you tell me
where the money is?

455
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:03,498
Don't you trust me, darling?

456
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:06,505
Yeah, sure I trust you. Sure.

457
00:47:07,474 --> 00:47:09,203
Hey, maybe you're right.

458
00:47:09,877 --> 00:47:12,368
Maybe you have gotta be protected.

459
00:47:13,547 --> 00:47:16,641
Both of you.
In case anything happens to me.

460
00:47:18,452 --> 00:47:20,511
Yeah, maybe you're right.

461
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:24,817
I'll make a deal.

462
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:28,189
You lay out the dough for the new face,

463
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:32,494
I'll give Margot a map
showing the place where I hid the dough.

464
00:47:32,566 --> 00:47:35,899
Now, in case I don't pull through
the operation okay, Margot pays off.

465
00:47:35,969 --> 00:47:37,527
Is that okay, Jim?

466
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:39,595
It's okay by me, Frankie.

467
00:48:16,743 --> 00:48:19,439
Here you are, baby. Here's your protection.

468
00:48:19,513 --> 00:48:23,506
You don't have to be afraid any longer.
You see, I do think about you.

469
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:28,610
- What have you done?
- I also think about myself.

470
00:48:30,357 --> 00:48:32,917
Don't be so disappointed, beautiful.

471
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:36,524
In case anything happens to me,
I'll still be wearing these clothes.

472
00:48:36,597 --> 00:48:39,896
Your protection
will be waiting for you right here.

473
00:48:39,967 --> 00:48:42,265
- I'll go for the doctor now.
- Wait.

474
00:48:43,136 --> 00:48:45,798
You haven't kissed me yet, Margot.

475
00:48:45,872 --> 00:48:49,330
No, Frankie. Not now, there isn't time.

476
00:48:49,409 --> 00:48:51,969
You're wrong, baby.
There's time, plenty of time.

477
00:48:52,045 --> 00:48:55,173
Just a little kiss,
a little welcome back kiss.

478
00:48:55,248 --> 00:48:57,978
- There isn't time, Frankie.
- Why not?

479
00:48:58,051 --> 00:48:59,678
Why not, Jimmy boy?

480
00:48:59,753 --> 00:49:01,653
Why shouldn't I kiss my girl?

481
00:49:01,722 --> 00:49:03,849
My little Margot,
who doesn't have to worry anymore

482
00:49:03,924 --> 00:49:06,415
about what's going to happen to her
after I die.

483
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:28,809
Margot!

484
00:50:18,632 --> 00:50:20,156
Dr. Craig?

485
00:50:22,669 --> 00:50:25,365
Just dropped around for a visit

486
00:50:27,808 --> 00:50:29,070
inside.

487
00:51:31,404 --> 00:51:33,838
Gotta be an engineer too, eh, Doc?

488
00:51:38,311 --> 00:51:39,539
Doc,

489
00:51:41,548 --> 00:51:44,346
I came over to find out
about Frankie Olins.

490
00:51:47,621 --> 00:51:49,555
What about Frankie Olins?

491
00:51:51,224 --> 00:51:52,885
You sign that?

492
00:52:02,769 --> 00:52:03,963
Yes.

493
00:52:07,774 --> 00:52:11,005
Well, I guess that takes care of that angle.

494
00:52:11,077 --> 00:52:12,669
Sorry to bother you at this hour, Doc,

495
00:52:12,746 --> 00:52:15,510
but there's been somebody
playing pranks with Frankie's body

496
00:52:15,582 --> 00:52:17,812
and I had to make sure he was dead.

497
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:19,181
Pranks?

498
00:52:19,252 --> 00:52:20,344
Yeah.

499
00:52:21,254 --> 00:52:23,085
Some hoodlums hijacked
the morgue truck,

500
00:52:23,156 --> 00:52:26,455
knocked off the driver,
and walked away with Frankie.

501
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:30,029
Well, I gotta get going.

502
00:52:31,832 --> 00:52:36,064
Oh, by the way, Doc,
got a stay-awake pill handy?

503
00:52:36,136 --> 00:52:38,036
- Stay-awake pill?
- Yeah.

504
00:52:38,805 --> 00:52:41,171
My office hours are worse than yours.

505
00:52:42,209 --> 00:52:45,235
I still got a couple of house calls to make.

506
00:52:50,784 --> 00:52:51,978
Thanks.

507
00:52:53,653 --> 00:52:56,918
Guess you doctors
don't get much sleep either?

508
00:52:58,325 --> 00:53:00,259
Doctors and coppers.

509
00:53:00,327 --> 00:53:04,093
A lot of coppers chasing shadows
in the streets tonight.

510
00:53:04,164 --> 00:53:07,099
- You mean Olins' body?
- No.

511
00:53:07,167 --> 00:53:08,964
The guys who took it.

512
00:53:09,803 --> 00:53:12,499
I'm going out after a lad named Vincent.

513
00:53:13,874 --> 00:53:17,002
I've been a long time
saving it up for that guy.

514
00:53:17,911 --> 00:53:21,779
When I get him,
I'm going to lean on him heavy.

515
00:53:25,318 --> 00:53:26,876
Thanks for the pill, Doc.

516
00:53:31,424 --> 00:53:34,723
Oh, by the way, Doc,

517
00:53:36,696 --> 00:53:39,529
I didn't find the autopsy report on Frankie.

518
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,268
Have it sent over to my office
in the morning, will you?

519
00:53:42,335 --> 00:53:44,633
I'll need it
if the newspapers start screaming.

520
00:53:46,072 --> 00:53:48,506
You can send an aspirin along with it.

521
00:54:14,067 --> 00:54:17,230
- You murdered him.
- Shut up, you fool.

522
00:54:17,304 --> 00:54:19,534
I've got to get back
to my apartment right away.

523
00:54:19,606 --> 00:54:21,540
I'm a cinch to be
number two on Portugal's list

524
00:54:21,608 --> 00:54:23,473
when your place turns up empty.

525
00:54:23,543 --> 00:54:25,340
He can't pin a thing on me.

526
00:54:25,412 --> 00:54:27,107
Jo Jo doesn't play that way.

527
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,875
If he's after you, he must know something.

528
00:54:28,949 --> 00:54:30,314
We've got to find out how much.

529
00:54:30,383 --> 00:54:32,908
- What then?
- We may have to run for it.

530
00:54:33,553 --> 00:54:35,350
How? The roads will all be locked tight.

531
00:54:35,422 --> 00:54:38,550
We can use Craig's car.
It's got doctor's plates.

532
00:54:38,625 --> 00:54:40,149
You'll have to drive.

533
00:54:44,931 --> 00:54:46,330
Get out.

534
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,862
Both of you.

535
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:51,868
Get out.

536
00:54:51,938 --> 00:54:53,166
Are you crazy?

537
00:54:53,239 --> 00:54:55,799
Portugal's men are
combing the city for Vincent.

538
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:59,276
I don't care. I'm through.

539
00:54:59,346 --> 00:55:02,474
- You're nothing but...
- You'd better care and you're not through.

540
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:05,882
You're in the middle. Deep.
Over your head.

541
00:55:05,952 --> 00:55:07,044
No matter what you do now,

542
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,520
you're still part
of everything that's happened.

543
00:55:09,589 --> 00:55:11,989
You're part of the grab
for Frankie's money,

544
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:14,993
you're part of the murder
that Portugal talked about tonight,

545
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:19,020
even the manhunt for Vince,
you're part of that, too.

546
00:55:19,099 --> 00:55:22,660
You're as guilty as we are
and you might as well face it.

547
00:55:23,103 --> 00:55:25,037
- No, no.
- Yes.

548
00:55:25,105 --> 00:55:26,697
Ask Portugal.

549
00:55:26,773 --> 00:55:30,140
Ask him tomorrow when he finally gets
tired of waiting for an autopsy report

550
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:33,646
that never arrives,
because there never was an autopsy.

551
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,214
Vince, get the other half of the map.

552
00:56:16,823 --> 00:56:20,315
I'll phone you from my place
as soon as I know what's what.

553
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,044
All alone?

554
00:56:49,122 --> 00:56:51,090
How did you get in here?

555
00:56:53,126 --> 00:56:55,822
Makes two angles I misfigured tonight.

556
00:56:57,897 --> 00:56:59,694
Must be the overtime.

557
00:56:59,766 --> 00:57:01,324
How did you get in here?

558
00:57:01,401 --> 00:57:03,562
Oh, getting in was easy.

559
00:57:03,636 --> 00:57:05,501
I'm a little worried about getting out.

560
00:57:05,572 --> 00:57:07,301
Georgia, what do you mean
by letting him in?

561
00:57:07,373 --> 00:57:09,136
He made me, Miss Margot. He made me.

562
00:57:09,209 --> 00:57:12,576
- Said if I didn't, he'd put me in jail.
- It's all right, Georgia. Go to bed.

563
00:57:15,215 --> 00:57:18,116
- Cup of coffee?
- Brave man.

564
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:20,152
Good coffee. Georgia made it.

565
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,615
What do you want?

566
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,589
Picked up a couple
of knife-happy lads tonight.

567
00:57:24,657 --> 00:57:27,626
They were out playing games,
but they did a sloppy job.

568
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:30,424
One of the guys they stuck
lived long enough to talk.

569
00:57:30,497 --> 00:57:31,794
Yes?

570
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:35,460
One of the people he talked about
was your little playmate, Vincent.

571
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:38,663
You mean you came here
looking for Jimmy?

572
00:57:38,738 --> 00:57:39,932
How disappointing.

573
00:57:40,006 --> 00:57:42,873
I thought you came because you
couldn't stay away from me any longer.

574
00:57:42,942 --> 00:57:45,172
Don't let that face of yours
go to your head.

575
00:57:45,245 --> 00:57:46,644
Or to yours?

576
00:57:48,648 --> 00:57:50,343
Wouldn't matter if it did.

577
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:53,145
People who use pretty faces
like you use yours

578
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:55,312
don't live very long, anyway.

579
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:58,152
How do you think
I should use my face, Jo Jo?

580
00:57:58,224 --> 00:58:01,682
- You're rolling your own dice, kid.
- Maybe.

581
00:58:01,761 --> 00:58:03,695
I'd like to roll them for both of us.

582
00:58:03,763 --> 00:58:05,697
The way you did for Frankie Olins?

583
00:58:05,765 --> 00:58:07,733
He ran his own life and I ran mine.

584
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,098
We had the same ideas. Just add it up.

585
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:11,501
It's simple arithmetic.

586
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:13,562
Didn't add up so good for Frankie.

587
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:16,074
Why not?
He had what he wanted, didn't he?

588
00:58:16,142 --> 00:58:17,632
He spent more money in five years

589
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:19,735
than you'll make if you live to be 500.

590
00:58:19,812 --> 00:58:23,145
- That's simple arithmetic, too.
- Yeah.

591
00:58:23,216 --> 00:58:24,740
Maybe I'll live.

592
00:58:24,817 --> 00:58:27,809
Maybe you won't,
if Jim Vincent sees you first.

593
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:33,218
Want some more coffee before you go?

594
00:58:33,293 --> 00:58:35,318
Oh, no thanks. Save it.

595
00:58:35,395 --> 00:58:38,193
You may wake up someday
with an awful headache.

596
00:59:53,072 --> 00:59:54,869
- Hello?
<i>- Vince?</i>

597
00:59:54,941 --> 00:59:56,340
Yeah, this is Vince.

598
00:59:56,409 --> 00:59:59,572
Portugal's got you cold.
We'll have to run for it.

599
00:59:59,646 --> 01:00:03,673
I'll meet you at the corner of 16th
and Cherokee in 15 minutes, right?

600
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:05,615
<i>How is he?</i>

601
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:07,277
Oh, he's all right.

602
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:08,581
<i>No trouble?</i>

603
01:00:09,789 --> 01:00:12,019
No, no trouble.

604
01:00:12,091 --> 01:00:13,615
We'll get it tonight.

605
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:15,684
Yeah, we'll get the dough right away.

606
01:00:21,734 --> 01:00:25,534
Come on, Dr. Craig, get your hat and coat.

607
01:00:27,273 --> 01:00:29,764
Come on, come on.
We haven't got all night.

608
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:30,064
Turn right, keep going straight
until you hit the State Highway.

609
01:01:43,916 --> 01:01:46,111
You can ride this road
right into Jordanville.

610
01:01:46,185 --> 01:01:49,279
- How far is it?
- About 150 or 160 miles.

611
01:01:49,355 --> 01:01:52,654
The dough is in a place just off
the highway about 12 miles past the town.

612
01:01:52,725 --> 01:01:53,851
Step on it.

613
01:02:17,450 --> 01:02:18,974
Police road block.

614
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:21,882
Don't be a fool.

615
01:02:29,629 --> 01:02:31,563
All right, bud. Let's see your license.

616
01:02:38,938 --> 01:02:41,168
- Hey, what's the matter with him?
- He's sick.

617
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:43,140
I'm the doctor at Watchaprague.

618
01:02:43,209 --> 01:02:45,439
Here's my Prison Bureau card.

619
01:02:46,312 --> 01:02:49,247
Oh, okay. Sorry to hold you up, Doc.
Go right ahead.

620
01:03:03,429 --> 01:03:04,953
Close.

621
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:06,555
I need a drink after that.

622
01:03:06,632 --> 01:03:08,497
Yeah, me, too.

623
01:03:08,568 --> 01:03:10,695
Let's wait till we get through the town.

624
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:41,258
Good evening.
Would you care to sit here, madam?

625
01:03:41,334 --> 01:03:42,665
No, there.

626
01:03:53,846 --> 01:03:55,905
Chili, hamburger, creamed chicken?

627
01:03:55,982 --> 01:03:58,246
- The creamed chicken...
- Get me a drink.

628
01:03:58,317 --> 01:04:00,148
Tea, coffee? The coffee's fresh.

629
01:04:00,219 --> 01:04:01,709
- Bourbon.
- Oh.

630
01:04:01,787 --> 01:04:04,085
I'll have some creamed chicken
and some coffee.

631
01:04:04,156 --> 01:04:06,249
And some Scotch first.

632
01:04:06,325 --> 01:04:07,986
The same.

633
01:04:23,209 --> 01:04:25,769
You handled that policeman
beautifully, Lloyd.

634
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:29,072
Yeah.

635
01:04:30,650 --> 01:04:33,175
I had to learn sometime, didn't I?

636
01:04:36,589 --> 01:04:38,022
Didn't I?

637
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:43,258
Yeah.

638
01:05:02,782 --> 01:05:04,113
Poor baby.

639
01:05:05,251 --> 01:05:06,741
Dead baby.

640
01:05:06,819 --> 01:05:08,480
You can't, Vince. We need him.

641
01:05:08,554 --> 01:05:10,613
What for? He's too drunk to drive.

642
01:05:11,357 --> 01:05:15,589
He's just dopey enough to start
feeling loud and sorry for himself.

643
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:17,788
Maybe you need him.

644
01:05:17,863 --> 01:05:21,094
All I need is half of that 400,000.

645
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:22,930
Half of that and me.

646
01:05:23,436 --> 01:05:27,338
- When do we...
- Oh, someplace between here and there.

647
01:05:28,074 --> 01:05:30,565
Come on.
I've got money singing in my brain.

648
01:05:30,643 --> 01:05:33,976
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Let's check that map first.

649
01:05:43,589 --> 01:05:46,581
Ten feet from the eucalyptus tree,

650
01:05:46,659 --> 01:05:49,184
a quarter of a mile off the highway.

651
01:05:49,261 --> 01:05:51,320
Well, now, this is a cinch.

652
01:05:55,468 --> 01:05:56,901
Let's go.

653
01:06:09,281 --> 01:06:11,146
Try your luck on the punchboard, mister?

654
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:12,514
Five cents a chance.

655
01:06:12,585 --> 01:06:15,213
Fellow in here yesterday
won pretty near $2.

656
01:06:15,921 --> 01:06:19,516
You know, dear,
we really can't afford it yet.

657
01:06:27,933 --> 01:06:29,366
You better get him.

658
01:06:29,435 --> 01:06:31,300
I'll meet you outside.

659
01:06:57,196 --> 01:06:58,390
You drive.

660
01:07:32,231 --> 01:07:35,359
- Flat, huh?
- Yeah, feels like it.

661
01:08:00,059 --> 01:08:02,926
Yeah, it's flat all right. Got a spare?

662
01:08:03,729 --> 01:08:06,493
Snap out of it, you. We gotta hurry.

663
01:08:06,565 --> 01:08:07,862
We're on a State Highway.

664
01:08:07,933 --> 01:08:10,128
He's in no condition.
You'll have to do it yourself.

665
01:08:10,202 --> 01:08:11,692
Take a look in the trunk.

666
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:21,639
Yeah, we got one.

667
01:08:30,890 --> 01:08:32,755
All fixed. Got a puff?

668
01:08:36,796 --> 01:08:39,697
Ready to roll in a minute.
Just gotta let her down.

669
01:10:15,561 --> 01:10:17,586
I'd like to kill you.

670
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:32,769
We're here! We're here!

671
01:11:32,838 --> 01:11:34,396
Don't you understand?

672
01:11:34,473 --> 01:11:37,169
Come on. Bring something to dig with.

673
01:11:51,223 --> 01:11:52,747
Lloyd, hurry!

674
01:12:01,633 --> 01:12:04,693
The eucalyptus trees.
Where's the hatchet mark?

675
01:12:09,942 --> 01:12:12,570
One, two, three,

676
01:12:12,644 --> 01:12:14,544
four, five,

677
01:12:14,613 --> 01:12:18,515
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

678
01:12:20,352 --> 01:12:23,116
One, two, three,

679
01:12:23,188 --> 01:12:25,019
four, five.

680
01:12:30,062 --> 01:12:33,361
Lloyd, where are you, you fool?

681
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:35,297
Lloyd, here, I found it!

682
01:12:35,367 --> 01:12:38,996
I found it, Lloyd! Come on!
Come and dig it!

683
01:12:39,571 --> 01:12:42,233
Come and dig for it! Dig!

684
01:12:47,646 --> 01:12:50,513
There it is, in the ground.

685
01:12:50,582 --> 01:12:52,880
It's right there beneath you, Lloyd.
In the ground.

686
01:12:52,951 --> 01:12:56,011
All our hopes, all our plans,

687
01:12:56,088 --> 01:12:58,283
they're all right there beneath you!

688
01:12:58,357 --> 01:13:00,257
Quickly, Lloyd, quickly.

689
01:13:00,325 --> 01:13:05,126
Dig for it! Deeper! Faster! Quickly, Lloyd!

690
01:13:05,197 --> 01:13:08,132
They killed for it! They all killed for it!

691
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:10,930
Frankie, Vincent, I killed for it!

692
01:13:11,003 --> 01:13:14,530
And you, you too, you killed for it!

693
01:13:23,882 --> 01:13:26,407
Get off! Get off it!

694
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:29,352
It's mine! It's all mine now!

695
01:13:30,556 --> 01:13:32,319
It's mine, I found it!

696
01:13:34,193 --> 01:13:35,888
It's mine!

697
01:13:45,604 --> 01:13:47,071
Mine.

698
01:13:47,606 --> 01:13:49,506
It's all mine now.

699
01:14:07,192 --> 01:14:09,990
Jo Jo, please,

700
01:14:10,062 --> 01:14:12,394
just this once,

701
01:14:12,464 --> 01:14:14,694
come down to my level.

702
01:14:41,293 --> 01:14:42,954
Simple arithmetic.

703
01:14:45,097 --> 01:14:46,758
That's all it was.

704
01:15:16,862 --> 01:15:19,353
"To you who double-crossed me,

705
01:15:20,632 --> 01:15:23,032
"I leave this dollar for your trouble.

706
01:15:24,069 --> 01:15:28,472
"The rest of the dough
I leave to the worms."

707
01:15:29,305 --> 01:15:35,308
