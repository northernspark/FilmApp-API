00:03:04,587 --> 00:03:06,976
Hey, Mr. Wilson!

3
00:03:34,907 --> 00:03:36,022
Mr. Wilson.

4
00:03:38,587 --> 00:03:40,418
Mr. Wilson?

5
00:03:41,747 --> 00:03:43,066
Mr. Wilson?

6
00:03:50,467 --> 00:03:52,856
Poor old Mr. Wilson must be so sick.

7
00:03:53,307 --> 00:03:55,059
No wonder he ain't up.

8
00:04:04,027 --> 00:04:05,221
Wow!

9
00:04:06,027 --> 00:04:08,825
His heart sounds like
our washing machine!

10
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:16,582
Oh, no.

11
00:04:16,787 --> 00:04:18,903
He's growing extra skin.

12
00:04:42,707 --> 00:04:44,618
His tongue's very ugly...

13
00:04:45,467 --> 00:04:47,264
and blue and spotty.

14
00:04:51,427 --> 00:04:52,496
Cool!

15
00:04:58,187 --> 00:04:59,700
He feels warm.

16
00:05:00,187 --> 00:05:01,939
He has a temperature.

17
00:05:02,467 --> 00:05:04,185
l know what you need.

18
00:05:04,707 --> 00:05:06,060
You need an aspirin.

19
00:06:23,827 --> 00:06:27,183
Don't you ever come back!
Do you hear me?

20
00:06:27,267 --> 00:06:28,382
Never!

21
00:06:29,267 --> 00:06:32,145
Starting part time will give you a chance
to ease back into it.

22
00:06:32,227 --> 00:06:35,105
l mean, managing shopping malls
can't be much more difficult...

23
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:36,700
than managing Dennis.

24
00:06:37,427 --> 00:06:39,019
Where have you been?

25
00:06:39,547 --> 00:06:40,502
Dennis?

26
00:06:41,747 --> 00:06:42,702
Dennis?

27
00:06:43,387 --> 00:06:45,423
l was at Mr. Wilson's house.

28
00:06:45,907 --> 00:06:47,625
And, boy, is he sick.

29
00:06:47,827 --> 00:06:50,387
He's got a fever, and he's burning up.

30
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,385
l better call Martha.

31
00:06:52,467 --> 00:06:54,901
You didn't bother him, did you?

32
00:06:55,267 --> 00:06:57,258
No, but l gave him an aspirin.

33
00:06:57,347 --> 00:07:00,066
And he don't like them any better than me.

34
00:07:00,707 --> 00:07:03,983
You shouldn't visit people
so early in the morning.

35
00:07:04,107 --> 00:07:07,144
That's the only time l know for sure
they'll be home.

36
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:08,865
Hello, George. Alice Mitchell.

37
00:07:08,947 --> 00:07:11,017
Are you feeling all right?
Dennis said that you--

38
00:07:11,107 --> 00:07:12,017
Feeling all right!

39
00:07:12,107 --> 00:07:16,066
Your son just shot an aspirin
down my throat with a slingshot!

40
00:07:16,147 --> 00:07:17,500
l'm very sorry.

41
00:07:17,587 --> 00:07:18,861
You better talk to him!

42
00:07:18,947 --> 00:07:20,221
We'll talk to him.

43
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:23,026
When l was a child,
none oo this would have been tolerated!

44
00:07:23,307 --> 00:07:24,786
'Bye. 'Bye.

45
00:07:32,027 --> 00:07:33,016
Hi.

46
00:07:34,227 --> 00:07:37,025
Did you shoot an aspirin
into Mr. Wilson's mouth?

47
00:07:37,107 --> 00:07:40,383
l didn't want him to bite off my fingers
with his big, fake teeth.

48
00:07:40,467 --> 00:07:42,298
Those things are sharp!

49
00:07:43,387 --> 00:07:46,618
George said Dennis shot an aspirin
into his mouth with a slingshot.

50
00:07:46,707 --> 00:07:47,822
What slingshot?

51
00:07:47,907 --> 00:07:49,659
-Do you have a slingshot?
-l'm not sure.

52
00:07:49,747 --> 00:07:51,021
Give it to me.

53
00:07:55,947 --> 00:07:58,256
Mr. Wilson is very angry with you.

54
00:07:58,707 --> 00:08:01,141
l thought he was sick.
l was only trying to help.

55
00:08:01,387 --> 00:08:04,140
You go sit in the corner
and think about what you've done.

56
00:08:04,387 --> 00:08:06,184
-For how long?
-Until you're sorry.

57
00:08:06,267 --> 00:08:07,700
Oh, good. l'm sorry now.

58
00:08:08,267 --> 00:08:09,302
He can't sit in the corner.

59
00:08:09,387 --> 00:08:12,060
l have to take him
to Margaret Wade's house.

60
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:14,501
Margaret's house!

61
00:08:14,587 --> 00:08:17,738
l didn't do anything bad enough
to deserve to go to her house.

62
00:08:17,827 --> 00:08:20,546
She's a lunatic. l'll go crazy.
She tortures me.

63
00:08:20,627 --> 00:08:23,346
She's mean. She's ugly. She doesn't share!

64
00:08:24,307 --> 00:08:28,619
l arranged with Mrs. Wade for you
to go to their house while l work.

65
00:08:29,547 --> 00:08:30,866
Are you serious?

66
00:08:30,947 --> 00:08:33,666
You can't spend the summer
unsupervised. You're out of school.

67
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:34,975
l'll go back.

68
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:38,946
Your mother made arrangements.
That's it! l don't want any arguments.

69
00:08:42,907 --> 00:08:44,818
My life is falling apart.

70
00:08:54,227 --> 00:08:55,421
Hello, George.

71
00:08:56,267 --> 00:08:59,100
Let me take that off your hands. Sorry.

72
00:09:01,947 --> 00:09:02,902
l'm....

73
00:09:04,907 --> 00:09:06,977
l'm sorry about this morning.

74
00:09:08,107 --> 00:09:10,667
l won't mince words, Mitchell.

75
00:09:11,427 --> 00:09:13,463
Your kid is driving me nuts.

76
00:09:14,147 --> 00:09:16,945
-l'll talk to him again.
-Maybe it isn't talk that he needs.

77
00:09:17,027 --> 00:09:20,702
When my dad had something important
to tell me, he told me with his belt.

78
00:09:20,787 --> 00:09:23,142
That's not how l deal with my son,
Mr. Wilson.

79
00:09:23,347 --> 00:09:24,496
However you deal with him...

80
00:09:24,587 --> 00:09:28,978
he hasn't learned you don't shoot
an aspirin down a fellow's throat!

81
00:09:29,107 --> 00:09:32,179
-Mr. Wilson, he's five.
-When l was five, l had some respect.

82
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:35,065
You were probably an exceptional boy.

83
00:09:35,147 --> 00:09:38,742
ln 1925, l was not the exception,
l was the rule.

84
00:09:38,827 --> 00:09:41,057
l'll make sure
Dennis doesn't come by anymore.

85
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,899
Careful how you say it.

86
00:09:42,987 --> 00:09:46,184
l don't want everybody to think
l'm a child-hater or an ogre.

87
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:49,340
l'm a reasonable man
who expects reasonable treatment...

88
00:09:49,427 --> 00:09:51,338
from his neighbors and their children.

89
00:09:51,427 --> 00:09:54,863
l was with the post office
for more than 43 years, and never once--

90
00:09:54,947 --> 00:09:56,016
l'm running a little late.

91
00:09:56,107 --> 00:09:58,905
l'll come by after work
and we can continue the conversation.

92
00:09:58,987 --> 00:10:02,263
There's nothing to continue.
l've said my piece. We'll leave it at that.

93
00:10:02,347 --> 00:10:05,544
The boy cannot come over here
unless he behaves himself.

94
00:10:05,627 --> 00:10:06,980
He won't be over at all.

95
00:10:07,067 --> 00:10:10,901
Now don't make me out to be a grump.
l didn't say ''never.'' l said--

96
00:10:10,987 --> 00:10:12,784
l really have to go.

97
00:10:13,707 --> 00:10:15,538
Well, now, don't....

98
00:10:18,507 --> 00:10:20,065
Have a good day.

99
00:10:20,627 --> 00:10:22,379
He's out of school now.

100
00:10:22,467 --> 00:10:24,822
He can't spend all his free time here.

101
00:10:24,907 --> 00:10:27,467
l'm not the bad guy in this, Mitchell.

102
00:10:27,547 --> 00:10:29,026
l'm the victim!

103
00:10:30,227 --> 00:10:32,741
George, who were you shouting at?

104
00:10:33,347 --> 00:10:36,578
Mitchell, and l wasn't shouting.
l was making my point.

105
00:10:36,827 --> 00:10:40,024
lt's not right that his youngster
can run wild doing as he pleases...

106
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:42,746
without regard to people or property.

107
00:10:42,827 --> 00:10:44,738
He's only a boy, George.

108
00:10:44,907 --> 00:10:46,704
He'll knot my rope once too often.

109
00:10:46,787 --> 00:10:49,506
l can't stand that kid! He's a menace!

110
00:10:49,867 --> 00:10:54,065
You'd better come in and have breakfast.
We're due at the Garden Club at 9:00.

111
00:10:54,827 --> 00:10:59,059
Today is an important day for me, and
l'm already in a lather because of that kid.

112
00:10:59,147 --> 00:11:02,298
l don't know if l'll even be able
to enjoy my moment of triumph.

113
00:11:02,387 --> 00:11:04,264
Don't get your hopes up.

114
00:11:04,587 --> 00:11:07,784
There are lots of other gardens in town
just as nice as yours.

115
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,664
Please! l'm a shoe-in.

116
00:11:12,467 --> 00:11:16,142
Who else has a night-blooming
mock orchid flowering this year?

117
00:11:17,827 --> 00:11:20,295
lt's an awfully homely looking plant.

118
00:11:20,587 --> 00:11:22,384
Hang the looks of the thing!

119
00:11:22,467 --> 00:11:25,220
lt opens before your eyes
in the light of the full moon.

120
00:11:25,307 --> 00:11:26,786
lt's a marvel, Martha.

121
00:11:26,867 --> 00:11:29,176
Forty years to mature and blossom.

122
00:11:29,507 --> 00:11:32,465
The flower opens and withers
in a matter of moments.

123
00:11:32,547 --> 00:11:35,107
There isn't a gardener in town
with a plant that requires...

124
00:11:35,187 --> 00:11:38,702
a 40-year investment
for 10 seconds of splendor.

125
00:11:51,187 --> 00:11:53,496
How do you feel about me working?

126
00:11:55,867 --> 00:11:57,505
A lot of moms work.

127
00:11:58,587 --> 00:12:02,262
The best l could do finding someone
to watch you is Mrs. Wade.

128
00:12:04,427 --> 00:12:07,464
What about Joey?
Did you think about him?

129
00:12:07,587 --> 00:12:10,943
What if he comes over?
He'll think l moved.

130
00:12:11,067 --> 00:12:14,298
Joey's mother made plans
with Mrs. Wade just like l did.

131
00:12:14,547 --> 00:12:16,538
Joey's at Margaret's house.

132
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:25,582
Do it!

133
00:12:27,067 --> 00:12:29,422
-l can make you.
-How?

134
00:12:30,947 --> 00:12:32,539
l'll slug you back.

135
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,300
-You can't hit a girl.
-l can too.

136
00:12:35,627 --> 00:12:38,664
Try it. l'll scream
so awfully, bloody, deadly horrible...

137
00:12:38,747 --> 00:12:40,658
my mom'll think you tried to murder me.

138
00:12:40,747 --> 00:12:45,457
l'll say you did and she'll believe it.
Because boys are like that and girls aren't.

139
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:47,020
That really stinks.

140
00:12:47,107 --> 00:12:47,983
Quit wasting time.

141
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:51,139
Mush your lips together
and let's get this over with.

142
00:12:55,467 --> 00:12:57,025
Close your eyes!

143
00:13:03,387 --> 00:13:04,536
Kiss me.

144
00:13:11,347 --> 00:13:13,065
All right. Let's go.

145
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:14,941
Dennis, come on.

146
00:13:15,267 --> 00:13:16,461
Oh, gosh.

147
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:18,265
Acting like a baby.

148
00:13:20,227 --> 00:13:21,182
Get up!

149
00:13:22,387 --> 00:13:24,059
Right this instant!

150
00:13:25,027 --> 00:13:27,063
Don't you dare embarrass me!

151
00:13:28,747 --> 00:13:30,897
Fine, l'll drag you inside.

152
00:13:35,227 --> 00:13:38,299
You guys are the boring ones.
There's lots to do.

153
00:13:38,787 --> 00:13:40,584
Oh, really? Like what?

154
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:42,698
We could practice singing songs.

155
00:13:42,787 --> 00:13:44,061
Or put on a play...

156
00:13:44,147 --> 00:13:45,739
or a puppet show.

157
00:13:45,827 --> 00:13:49,342
-We could bury you alive.
-l could pound your face.

158
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,823
lt doesn't matter, anyways, Margaret.

159
00:13:52,347 --> 00:13:55,100
We'll be leaving soon
and we have work to do.

160
00:13:55,187 --> 00:13:57,018
We're going to make a fort.

161
00:13:57,667 --> 00:14:00,704
You can't leave unless l go with you,
or l'll tell on you.

162
00:14:00,787 --> 00:14:02,982
So, tough kitty paws, l'm going.

163
00:14:03,227 --> 00:14:06,139
Climb down from there. l'll get my purse.

164
00:14:39,307 --> 00:14:42,265
This thing's been here our whole life
and we never knew it.

165
00:14:42,347 --> 00:14:45,862
-Do you think anybody lives in it?
-Just squirrels and birds.

166
00:14:45,947 --> 00:14:47,778
lt looks kind of junky.

167
00:14:48,027 --> 00:14:49,346
We'll fix it up.

168
00:14:49,627 --> 00:14:51,618
Good. l'll be the decorator.

169
00:14:51,707 --> 00:14:55,825
We'll put on a special room for the babies
and a powder room for guests.

170
00:14:56,347 --> 00:14:58,497
Forts don't have powder rooms.

171
00:14:59,027 --> 00:14:59,937
Really?

172
00:15:00,027 --> 00:15:02,905
Where do the soldiers' wives go
to freshen up?

173
00:15:03,307 --> 00:15:06,458
Soldiers don't have wives, stupid.

174
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:10,456
Don't call me stupid, baby rump kisser!

175
00:15:12,547 --> 00:15:15,220
lt won't be a fort. lt'll be a house.

176
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:16,866
A love nest.

177
00:15:17,747 --> 00:15:20,898
Let's go up and see
what color carpet we should get.

178
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,059
Do forts got carpet?

179
00:15:23,387 --> 00:15:24,263
Nope.

180
00:15:24,347 --> 00:15:26,622
Forts don't got carpet!

181
00:15:27,147 --> 00:15:28,944
They do now, hot lips!

182
00:15:32,987 --> 00:15:35,547
The Selection Committee has informed...

183
00:15:35,747 --> 00:15:38,056
Mrs. Butterwell and l...

184
00:15:38,267 --> 00:15:42,863
that this summer's Floraganza
will be held in the garden of....

185
00:15:47,067 --> 00:15:48,739
Can you read this here?

186
00:15:52,427 --> 00:15:54,816
You take these and l'll take those.

187
00:15:56,187 --> 00:15:58,860
There we go. The garden of...

188
00:16:01,147 --> 00:16:02,739
George Wilson!

189
00:16:13,107 --> 00:16:16,816
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi, three Mississippi...

190
00:16:16,907 --> 00:16:19,262
four Mississippi, five Mississippi.

191
00:16:19,347 --> 00:16:20,462
Six Mississippi...

192
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:24,825
seven Mississippi, eight Mississippi,
nine Mississippi.

193
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,025
Gunther, are you watching
where everybody goes?

194
00:16:29,147 --> 00:16:30,182
Yep.

195
00:16:34,187 --> 00:16:35,939
Girls. Now....

196
00:16:38,587 --> 00:16:39,861
Let's go!

197
00:16:43,227 --> 00:16:46,025
You know,
l was unbeatable at hide-and-seek.

198
00:16:46,267 --> 00:16:47,586
Hiding or seeking?

199
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:50,135
Both. l had a nose for hiding places.

200
00:16:50,707 --> 00:16:52,777
l wouldn't think you'd be much good
at hiding.

201
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:54,061
Why not?

202
00:16:54,227 --> 00:16:56,024
Weren't you a fat boy?

203
00:16:57,347 --> 00:16:58,700
l was husky.

204
00:16:59,867 --> 00:17:01,903
Ready or not, here l come!

205
00:17:04,907 --> 00:17:06,022
l see Joey and Mike!

206
00:17:06,107 --> 00:17:07,426
Run, Mikey!

207
00:17:07,987 --> 00:17:09,420
He's cheating.

208
00:17:10,587 --> 00:17:12,179
What are you doing?

209
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:16,662
Dennis is cheating.
He's using the Beckman kid as a spy.

210
00:17:17,067 --> 00:17:19,137
Leave them alone, George.

211
00:17:19,587 --> 00:17:21,259
l'll even things up.

212
00:17:21,587 --> 00:17:25,978
Gunther, l'm just talking to your daddy
on the telephone.

213
00:17:26,187 --> 00:17:29,896
He's going to the ice-cream store.
He wants to take you with him.

214
00:17:30,307 --> 00:17:32,263
Hurry up and go home!

215
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:36,826
Now it's fair.

216
00:17:40,027 --> 00:17:42,177
You lied to a toddler, George.

217
00:17:43,347 --> 00:17:46,419
Think how disappointed he will be
when he gets home.

218
00:17:46,507 --> 00:17:50,341
He better get used to it. Disappointment
will be a big part of his life.

219
00:17:50,427 --> 00:17:54,136
He's a foot short for his age.
And he's cross-eyed.

220
00:18:51,427 --> 00:18:53,622
Ain't that a pretty sight?

221
00:18:54,507 --> 00:18:57,943
l bet they don't even lock their doors.

222
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:05,982
You won't notice a toy store
on the first level...

223
00:19:06,067 --> 00:19:07,466
but my suggestion is this:

224
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:11,540
Give the toy store six months free rent
to move up to the third level.

225
00:19:16,307 --> 00:19:20,539
When l go to the mall with my little boy,
we always visit the toy store.

226
00:19:21,107 --> 00:19:25,544
He knows he won't get anything unless
it's a special occasion, but like every kid...

227
00:19:25,627 --> 00:19:27,026
he wants to look around--

228
00:19:27,107 --> 00:19:29,575
Could you spare us the family anecdotes?

229
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:34,220
There's always a lot of traffic in toy stores.

230
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:37,743
lf people have to go up to the third level
to visit the toy store...

231
00:19:37,827 --> 00:19:40,944
then they have to go through
two other levels to get there.

232
00:19:41,027 --> 00:19:43,018
That's apparent to anyone with children.

233
00:19:43,107 --> 00:19:45,337
And you have to assume
that potential tenants...

234
00:19:45,427 --> 00:19:47,941
might have kids and would know that...

235
00:19:48,027 --> 00:19:51,861
and it might entice them
to take up space in the other levels.

236
00:19:53,387 --> 00:19:54,661
That's all l'm saying.

237
00:19:59,227 --> 00:20:02,025
We could have carried up
a lot more stuff...

238
00:20:02,147 --> 00:20:05,935
if you didn't have to bring that idiotic doll
and all her junk!

239
00:20:06,027 --> 00:20:09,656
She's not idiotic!
She's an important training tool.

240
00:20:09,747 --> 00:20:13,820
You know why men are so lousy
when it comes to taking care of babies?

241
00:20:14,107 --> 00:20:16,257
They have better things to do.

242
00:20:16,387 --> 00:20:19,220
Like what? Play golf and drink beer?

243
00:20:19,307 --> 00:20:23,937
No, like hunting, having wars, driving cars,
shaving, cleaning fish.

244
00:20:24,067 --> 00:20:25,420
Do you know how to do that?

245
00:20:25,507 --> 00:20:26,542
Me?

246
00:20:26,827 --> 00:20:27,896
Margaret.

247
00:20:28,067 --> 00:20:28,783
Oh, okay.

248
00:20:28,867 --> 00:20:31,335
lf you didn't have women,
you wouldn't have babies...

249
00:20:31,587 --> 00:20:33,498
and you wouldn't have people.

250
00:20:33,907 --> 00:20:37,661
lf you didn't have men,
who'd drive the ladies to the hospital?

251
00:20:39,347 --> 00:20:44,102
Most important, they marry the women,
then the women can go and get the baby.

252
00:20:44,187 --> 00:20:46,337
The baby is in her stomach!

253
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:51,224
She has to get it installed. Her stomach
isn't just filled up with babies.

254
00:20:51,307 --> 00:20:54,458
-Who installs them?
-A minister and a doctor.

255
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:55,941
-How?
-How?

256
00:20:56,907 --> 00:20:58,704
She wants to know how?

257
00:21:05,147 --> 00:21:06,944
Tell me, Dennis, how?

258
00:21:07,147 --> 00:21:08,944
The bellybutton. lt opens up.

259
00:21:09,387 --> 00:21:13,699
-How come men have them?
-So they don't look weird in bathing suits.

260
00:21:15,427 --> 00:21:17,861
Okay, on the count of three...

261
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,665
move your hand.

262
00:21:19,787 --> 00:21:20,776
One.

263
00:21:23,187 --> 00:21:24,222
Two.

264
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:27,782
Three!

265
00:21:32,747 --> 00:21:35,625
Okay, this time on the count of four.

266
00:21:36,467 --> 00:21:37,502
One.

267
00:21:38,427 --> 00:21:39,906
Two.

268
00:21:40,107 --> 00:21:41,222
Three.

269
00:21:41,747 --> 00:21:42,816
Four!

270
00:21:44,587 --> 00:21:48,136
Joey, you hold the hammer and,
Margaret, you hold the nail.

271
00:22:02,707 --> 00:22:04,459
We did a pretty good job.

272
00:22:04,547 --> 00:22:07,220
-How about a little paint?
-Couldn't hurt.

273
00:22:07,307 --> 00:22:09,537
-You got any?
-My dad does.

274
00:22:16,907 --> 00:22:20,024
-Give me my doll, you jerk!
-l don't have it!

275
00:22:21,227 --> 00:22:24,105
-Give it to me! Dennis!
-l didn't take your doll.

276
00:22:24,187 --> 00:22:26,496
lt's not here. Somebody took it.

277
00:22:26,627 --> 00:22:28,583
We've been with you.

278
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:35,787
Do you guys swear you didn't take it?

279
00:22:35,947 --> 00:22:36,982
Yep.

280
00:22:38,587 --> 00:22:40,145
l've been robbed!

281
00:22:45,987 --> 00:22:50,663
You don't understand.
Baby Louise is a very expensive antique.

282
00:22:51,107 --> 00:22:53,098
Nobody robbed your doll.

283
00:22:53,267 --> 00:22:55,098
-Maybe a bear ate it.
-What?

284
00:22:55,427 --> 00:22:58,146
Yeah, there's no robbers in our town.

285
00:23:51,907 --> 00:23:53,818
What are you eating there, sport?

286
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,222
A apple.

287
00:25:08,787 --> 00:25:09,856
Hi, Mr. Mitchell.

288
00:25:10,307 --> 00:25:12,059
Hello, Polly. Come on in.

289
00:25:12,227 --> 00:25:15,344
-What's the helmet for?
-My girlfriend used to baby-sit for Dennis.

290
00:25:15,427 --> 00:25:17,987
She said to bring a helmet and wear pants.

291
00:26:51,907 --> 00:26:53,704
l'm looking for Polly.

292
00:26:54,267 --> 00:26:55,700
You're Mickey?

293
00:26:56,027 --> 00:26:57,062
Yeah.

294
00:26:57,707 --> 00:27:00,983
She's up in my mom's bathroom
using the armpit perfume.

295
00:27:01,067 --> 00:27:05,140
She says you're such a stud,
she gets nervous and sweats a lot.

296
00:27:06,227 --> 00:27:07,182
Cool.

297
00:27:07,747 --> 00:27:09,066
Come on in.

298
00:27:48,507 --> 00:27:49,940
Tastes funny.

299
00:27:56,787 --> 00:27:58,379
Tastes like paint.

300
00:28:01,267 --> 00:28:02,461
And wood.

301
00:28:04,827 --> 00:28:06,943
l'll make us some sandwiches.

302
00:28:24,827 --> 00:28:27,421
'''Do not cry, little locomotive,'...

He eats all his coal

00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:43,985
Where are you going?

321
00:29:52,467 --> 00:29:55,140
l'm going to investigate Mitchell's garage.

322
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:58,902
Dennis has been fooling around with paint.
l know it, and l will prove it.

323
00:29:59,187 --> 00:30:02,179
Aren't you taking this a bit far, George?

324
00:30:03,027 --> 00:30:04,540
He's only a boy.

325
00:30:58,587 --> 00:30:59,656
Kids!

326
00:31:16,427 --> 00:31:18,065
G.D. wading pool!

327
00:31:29,307 --> 00:31:30,581
That's it!

328
00:32:26,347 --> 00:32:29,225
Gee, l guess those kids took off.

329
00:32:44,747 --> 00:32:46,419
l got him this time.

330
00:32:46,867 --> 00:32:48,698
Mitchell can't deny it.

331
00:33:07,467 --> 00:33:08,980
Sorry. Good night.

332
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:17,583
He's only a boy, huh?

333
00:33:55,947 --> 00:33:57,460
Hi, Mrs. Wilson.

334
00:33:58,747 --> 00:34:00,465
ls Mr. Wilson up yet?

335
00:34:00,627 --> 00:34:02,060
Not yet, dear.

336
00:34:02,267 --> 00:34:04,622
How long do you think he's going to sleep?

337
00:34:04,707 --> 00:34:07,779
Not too much longer.
He's having his picture taken this morning.

338
00:34:07,907 --> 00:34:11,422
-For what?
-He's being honored for his garden.

339
00:34:12,427 --> 00:34:15,464
Do you think he would get mad
if l went upstairs?

340
00:34:16,267 --> 00:34:18,622
What do you want to go upstairs for?

341
00:34:18,707 --> 00:34:21,983
l made an ''l'm Sorry l Shot Paint
on Your Chicken'' card.

342
00:34:22,667 --> 00:34:24,578
That's very nice, Dennis.

343
00:34:24,947 --> 00:34:29,020
l'm kind of busy today,
so l won't have a chance to give it to him.

344
00:34:29,707 --> 00:34:31,743
l have to go to Margaret's house...

345
00:34:31,827 --> 00:34:34,660
because we're getting poor,
and my mom's got a job now.

346
00:34:34,747 --> 00:34:37,341
Could l leave it by his whisker cutter?

347
00:34:37,667 --> 00:34:39,976
That's where l leave
my dad's ''Sorry'' cards.

348
00:34:40,067 --> 00:34:42,706
And it's a good time to say you're sorry.

349
00:34:42,787 --> 00:34:45,460
Grownup guys are happy in the morning
when they wake up.

350
00:34:45,547 --> 00:34:46,696
My dad's so happy...

351
00:34:46,787 --> 00:34:48,937
he whistles when he goes
to the bathroom.

352
00:34:49,027 --> 00:34:51,666
The only time he isn't happy
is on Sunday morning...

353
00:34:51,747 --> 00:34:53,260
when he and my mom wrestle.

354
00:34:53,347 --> 00:34:55,258
They like to be alone when they do that.

355
00:34:55,347 --> 00:34:57,417
l think it's because they take off
their shirts.

356
00:34:57,507 --> 00:34:59,065
Then they start to make funny noises--

357
00:34:59,147 --> 00:35:00,182
You can go up...

358
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:03,179
as long as you promise
not to disturb Mr. Wilson.

359
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,541
l promise.

360
00:35:09,147 --> 00:35:11,138
You know what, Mrs. Wilson?

361
00:35:11,507 --> 00:35:12,542
What?

362
00:35:12,627 --> 00:35:15,425
You're the nicest old gal on the block.

363
00:36:11,187 --> 00:36:12,142
Hello.

364
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:15,265
My name is Dennis Mitchell.

365
00:36:17,107 --> 00:36:19,746
l'm the doctor. Open up and say....

366
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:54,542
Hello.

367
00:37:02,347 --> 00:37:03,905
Mr. Wilson.

368
00:37:05,107 --> 00:37:07,223
George? Are you ready?

369
00:37:07,867 --> 00:37:09,778
The photographer's here.

370
00:37:12,787 --> 00:37:14,425
l got a 9:30, ma'am.

371
00:37:14,747 --> 00:37:16,624
He'll be out any second.

372
00:37:17,787 --> 00:37:18,822
Sorry.

373
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:23,862
George?

374
00:37:30,187 --> 00:37:32,860
That looks fine, Martha. Leave it alone.

375
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:37,346
Martha, step back. You're in the picture.

376
00:37:40,067 --> 00:37:41,341
Very good.

377
00:37:41,747 --> 00:37:42,896
Now...

378
00:37:43,187 --> 00:37:44,142
smile.

379
00:38:34,387 --> 00:38:36,423
Hey, you.

380
00:38:37,827 --> 00:38:39,738
Yeah, you. Come here.

381
00:38:47,187 --> 00:38:49,382
l haven't seen you around here before.

382
00:38:51,547 --> 00:38:54,107
Maybe because
l've never been around here.

383
00:38:54,267 --> 00:38:55,620
What are you up to?

384
00:38:55,707 --> 00:38:57,265
What's it to you?

385
00:38:57,347 --> 00:38:58,302
Now, look.

386
00:38:59,027 --> 00:39:02,497
l run a nice, clean town here
and l don't want any trouble.

387
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:05,944
My advice to you
is just follow the sun out of here.

388
00:39:06,027 --> 00:39:09,622
Only reason l ain't moving on because
you stopped to give me the breeze.

389
00:39:34,187 --> 00:39:37,657
You have to go to two other levels
to get there and....

390
00:39:43,987 --> 00:39:45,818
Can l call you back?

391
00:39:48,867 --> 00:39:49,822
Hi, Mom.

392
00:39:50,547 --> 00:39:51,946
Good morning.

393
00:39:52,027 --> 00:39:55,099
l hear you're trying to beg off
the Oklahoma City trip.

394
00:39:55,587 --> 00:39:57,498
l asked that it be rescheduled.

395
00:39:57,747 --> 00:40:00,307
Have a Cub Scout meeting or something?

396
00:40:00,467 --> 00:40:03,584
My husband has a trip
that was scheduled before mine.

397
00:40:05,227 --> 00:40:08,537
lf you two are traveling at the same time,
no one can watch your kid.

398
00:40:08,627 --> 00:40:09,901
ls that the problem?

399
00:40:09,987 --> 00:40:12,547
-lt's not a problem, per se.
-Oh, good.

400
00:40:12,627 --> 00:40:16,586
Because if you want to blow off your trip,
l have to cover for you.

401
00:40:16,867 --> 00:40:19,097
And l have plans l can't break.

402
00:40:19,547 --> 00:40:21,424
l don't have kids but...

403
00:40:22,267 --> 00:40:23,825
l do have a life.

404
00:40:25,227 --> 00:40:26,262
l'm sorry.

405
00:40:28,353 --> 00:40:30,344
l just won't be able to help you.

406
00:40:36,593 --> 00:40:37,582
God.

407
00:40:39,113 --> 00:40:41,104
-Okay.
-Who do we call first?

408
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,309
Let's start with the A's.

409
00:40:44,473 --> 00:40:45,462
Vicki?

410
00:40:45,553 --> 00:40:46,986
-You call.
-No, you call.

411
00:40:49,473 --> 00:40:50,269
Hello.

412
00:40:50,513 --> 00:40:53,823
Hi. This is Mrs. Mitchell.

413
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:01,744
Hi. Alice Mitchell.

414
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:04,947
Hi. Alice Mitchell.

415
00:41:05,673 --> 00:41:06,344
No.

416
00:41:09,953 --> 00:41:11,909
This is Henry Mitchell.

417
00:41:14,473 --> 00:41:16,464
This is Henry Mitchell.

418
00:41:31,313 --> 00:41:32,507
You call.

419
00:41:46,273 --> 00:41:49,902
Hey, Mr. Wilson. l'm sleeping at your joint.

420
00:41:54,113 --> 00:41:57,628
-l brought you some grasshoppers.
-You shouldn't have.

421
00:41:57,913 --> 00:41:59,346
l'll take them, dear.

422
00:42:00,873 --> 00:42:03,865
Thank you so much, Martha. George.

423
00:42:04,153 --> 00:42:05,142
lt's our pleasure.

424
00:42:05,233 --> 00:42:08,464
-You saved our lives.
-Save two, lose one.

425
00:42:08,593 --> 00:42:10,584
l'll call you just as soon as l arrive.

426
00:42:10,673 --> 00:42:13,107
-Do you have our number?
-Don't worry about a thing.

427
00:42:14,753 --> 00:42:18,063
l brought my own pillow
so l don't get my spit on yours.

428
00:42:18,153 --> 00:42:19,666
Thank you, dear.

429
00:42:21,753 --> 00:42:23,471
Be a good boy, okay?

430
00:42:26,513 --> 00:42:29,664
Mind your manners
and listen to Mr. and Mrs. Wilson.

431
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:34,992
-Thanks again.
-Thank you.

432
00:42:37,553 --> 00:42:38,668
Honey?

433
00:42:40,953 --> 00:42:41,908
Bye-bye.

434
00:42:41,993 --> 00:42:44,143
Bring me something good.

435
00:42:44,273 --> 00:42:45,388
'Bye, sweetheart.

436
00:42:45,473 --> 00:42:46,872
'Bye, Dennis.

437
00:42:47,873 --> 00:42:51,946
George, take Dennis' suitcase
up to the guest room, please.

438
00:42:52,393 --> 00:42:55,510
-He's got arms.
-Don't start, dear.

439
00:42:57,673 --> 00:43:00,506
You know why l'm not crying?

440
00:43:02,073 --> 00:43:04,462
Because if l can't be with my parents...

441
00:43:04,553 --> 00:43:07,147
the person l want to be with is you.

442
00:43:10,153 --> 00:43:13,145
l can't tell you how deeply moved l am.

443
00:43:38,353 --> 00:43:39,911
Don't do that, please.

444
00:43:39,993 --> 00:43:40,743
What?

445
00:43:40,833 --> 00:43:41,948
The cord.

446
00:43:42,033 --> 00:43:43,625
Stop that tapping.

447
00:43:47,793 --> 00:43:51,342
There's not a lot to do around the house
when it's raining out.

448
00:43:53,873 --> 00:43:56,182
-Do you wanna play cards?
-No.

449
00:43:58,513 --> 00:44:01,232
Want to put on your old Navy suit
and play war?

450
00:44:11,073 --> 00:44:13,382
-ls that pirates' gold?
-No.

451
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:15,626
ls it real valuable?

452
00:44:16,313 --> 00:44:17,268
Yes.

453
00:44:18,193 --> 00:44:20,263
ls that why you keep it in your safe?

454
00:44:20,513 --> 00:44:21,468
Uh-huh.

455
00:44:22,913 --> 00:44:24,949
How come your safe looks like books?

456
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:29,222
How come you ask so many questions?

457
00:44:29,753 --> 00:44:32,028
l've only been around for five years.

458
00:44:32,113 --> 00:44:34,149
There's a lot of stuff l don't know.

459
00:44:37,913 --> 00:44:39,824
The safe looks like books...

460
00:44:40,273 --> 00:44:43,549
so if a thief does come in,
he won't recognize it.

461
00:44:44,153 --> 00:44:46,303
-ls a thief a robber?
-Yes.

462
00:44:46,513 --> 00:44:49,232
-Have you ever had a robber here?
-No.

463
00:44:50,073 --> 00:44:51,984
What's the combination to your lock?

464
00:44:53,713 --> 00:44:56,910
You're the last person in the world
l'd tell that to.

465
00:44:57,393 --> 00:44:59,384
You've got it wrote down someplace?

466
00:44:59,473 --> 00:45:00,826
lt's in my head.

467
00:45:00,913 --> 00:45:04,462
-What's that mean?
-lt means l know it. l remember it.

468
00:45:04,713 --> 00:45:08,183
-What if you forget it?
-l won't forget it. lt's a familiar number.

469
00:45:08,273 --> 00:45:09,626
l won't forget it.

470
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,431
What's that mean?

471
00:45:11,553 --> 00:45:15,910
lt means it's a number
that l use all the time, so l won't forget it.

472
00:45:16,193 --> 00:45:17,990
l use it all the time.

473
00:45:18,593 --> 00:45:21,153
-l bet l know what it is.
-l doubt that.

474
00:45:21,433 --> 00:45:23,469
l bet it's your address.

475
00:45:24,393 --> 00:45:25,667
Know how l know?

476
00:45:25,753 --> 00:45:27,425
My friend has a bike lock...

477
00:45:27,513 --> 00:45:31,904
and he uses his address
for the combination so he won't forget.

478
00:45:32,113 --> 00:45:34,149
-You're just as smart as him.
-He.

479
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:37,905
You got everything figured out, don't you?

480
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:43,465
l haven't figured out
how to get my work done...

481
00:45:43,553 --> 00:45:45,464
with you in the house.

482
00:45:46,873 --> 00:45:48,545
That's a tough one.

483
00:46:05,193 --> 00:46:07,263
Are you wrinkled enough yet, Dennis?

484
00:46:09,273 --> 00:46:11,912
-Yep.
-Want me to come help you out of the tub?

485
00:46:12,433 --> 00:46:14,788
Not unless you want to see
what the stork saw.

486
00:46:39,153 --> 00:46:40,222
Cool!

487
00:46:40,473 --> 00:46:41,952
Old Faithful.

488
00:47:46,793 --> 00:47:50,388
-How old is this bed?
-lt belonged to my mother.

489
00:47:50,793 --> 00:47:52,590
What's she sleeping on?

490
00:47:53,153 --> 00:47:55,144
She's been gone for many years, Dennis.

491
00:47:57,193 --> 00:47:58,865
-On business?
-No.

492
00:47:59,753 --> 00:48:01,266
She's in heaven.

493
00:48:02,153 --> 00:48:04,872
There's an awful lot of people in heaven.

494
00:48:05,513 --> 00:48:07,310
Especially old people.

495
00:48:18,393 --> 00:48:22,306
How about if l recite my favorite poem
when l was your age?

496
00:48:22,913 --> 00:48:25,029
-ls it about flowers and lambs?
-No.

497
00:48:25,873 --> 00:48:26,828
Okay.

498

Poor thing.
l wish he'd get that hernia fixed.

521
00:51:56,953 --> 00:51:58,864
George, are you sleeping?

522
00:52:00,313 --> 00:52:02,543
l was until you started yakking.

523
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,227
l'm sorry.

524
00:52:06,593 --> 00:52:08,629
Was Dennis in our bathroom?

525
00:52:09,233 --> 00:52:10,188
Yes.

526
00:52:10,713 --> 00:52:15,025
l think the little rat
put mouthwash in my nasal spray...

527
00:52:15,593 --> 00:52:18,187
and toilet cleanser in my mouthwash.

528
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:21,987
Why would he do something like that?

529
00:52:23,953 --> 00:52:25,352
Must you ask?

530
00:52:30,953 --> 00:52:32,068
Quiet!

531
00:52:33,993 --> 00:52:36,382
l recited a poem for Dennis tonight...

532
00:52:37,033 --> 00:52:39,627
that my mother used to recite to me.

533
00:52:40,953 --> 00:52:42,864
l remembered every word.

534
00:52:45,233 --> 00:52:47,030
ln some tiny measure...

535
00:52:47,353 --> 00:52:51,187
my mother would be proud
l passed something on.

536
00:52:51,993 --> 00:52:53,585
lt's 10:00, Martha.

537
00:52:54,513 --> 00:52:56,629
Don't start with the regrets.

538
00:53:01,193 --> 00:53:03,423
l would have been a good mother.

539
00:53:06,193 --> 00:53:08,707
And l would have made a swell fireman.

540
00:53:22,513 --> 00:53:25,823
-Where are you going?
-To make myself a cup of tea.

541
00:53:29,753 --> 00:53:32,665
l didn't decree
that we wouldn't have children.

542
00:53:33,233 --> 00:53:35,428
That was out of both our hands.

543
00:53:37,113 --> 00:53:40,469
This isn't about having children
or not having children.

544
00:53:40,993 --> 00:53:42,472
You miss the point.

545
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:45,266
lt's about...

546
00:53:46,593 --> 00:53:49,107
my feeling something very good...

547
00:53:49,793 --> 00:53:52,148
and not being able to tell you about it.

548
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:32,348
Martha?

549
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:40,189
l didn't mean to hurt you.

550
00:54:40,913 --> 00:54:43,950
l'm not terribly good
with feelings and emotions.

551
00:54:45,113 --> 00:54:48,992
There are a lot of subjects
l'd just as soon not bring up or discuss.

552
00:54:49,873 --> 00:54:52,671
l would have liked a son or a daughter.

553
00:54:54,153 --> 00:54:57,111
You couldn't fire the fatherly feelings
in me...

554
00:54:58,033 --> 00:54:59,591
because they're not there.

555
00:55:00,553 --> 00:55:03,750
But that doesn't mean my feelings for you
have gone cold.

556
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:05,551
That'll never happen.

557
00:55:06,633 --> 00:55:08,828
You've got all the love l have.

558
00:55:11,113 --> 00:55:12,546
Remember this?

559
00:55:13,353 --> 00:55:17,232
Je t'aime. Je t'adore. Ma petite chérie.

560
00:55:25,993 --> 00:55:26,948
George.

561
00:55:40,233 --> 00:55:41,871
Get out of here!

562
00:55:47,313 --> 00:55:49,463
What are you looking for now?

563
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:51,626
Garden lanterns.

564
00:55:52,553 --> 00:55:56,865
You must be pretty brave to ride
on a tiger in your underpants.

565
00:55:57,233 --> 00:55:59,383
Put that away. That's not for kids!

566
00:56:57,473 --> 00:56:58,428
Martha.

567
00:56:58,873 --> 00:57:01,262
Where are the G.D. garden lanterns?

568
00:57:27,153 --> 00:57:29,348
l think l better go outside and play.

569
00:57:48,633 --> 00:57:49,588
Hello.

570
00:57:50,393 --> 00:57:51,382
Hello, Martha.

571
00:57:52,073 --> 00:57:53,392
lt's Alice.

572
00:57:53,513 --> 00:57:54,912
l'm still in Oklahoma.

573
00:57:55,273 --> 00:57:56,501
Oh, dear.

574
00:57:56,753 --> 00:57:58,869
Yes, there's a terrible storm.

575
00:57:58,953 --> 00:58:00,181
My olight's been cancelled.

576
00:58:00,753 --> 00:58:03,825
Till the weather clears,
l don't know what's going to happen.

577
00:58:05,633 --> 00:58:08,067
l know your garden party's tonight.
l oeel terrible.

578
00:58:08,153 --> 00:58:10,348
l don't know what to do.

579
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:13,950
Don't worry about it.
You get home when you can.

580
00:58:14,593 --> 00:58:16,311
We'll be just fine here.

581
00:58:16,873 --> 00:58:18,909
What's George going to say?

582
00:58:20,793 --> 00:58:23,102
Over my dead body!

583
00:58:23,433 --> 00:58:27,984
This is my crowning moment of retired life
and l won't throw it away like the trash...

584
00:58:28,073 --> 00:58:31,509
for a ninny who can't get her keister
to the airport on time.

585
00:58:31,593 --> 00:58:34,391
George Wilson,
you have no right to insult Alice.

586
00:58:34,473 --> 00:58:37,385
She can't help the weather,
any more than you or l.

587
00:58:37,473 --> 00:58:38,986
lt's just plain bad luck.

588
00:58:39,073 --> 00:58:40,711
lt's no one's fault.

589
00:58:40,793 --> 00:58:44,342
A tragedy of this magnitude
has to be somebody's fault.

590
00:58:44,433 --> 00:58:46,105
lt isn't a tragedy.

591
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:48,867
A little boy's going to join us for a party.

592
00:58:49,593 --> 00:58:53,745
lf you want to forsake your neighbors
when they need help, do it alone.

593
00:58:55,473 --> 00:58:58,510
Why is it, when everyone else
feasts on the pleasures of life...

594
00:58:58,593 --> 00:58:59,867
l get the indigestion?

595
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,989
Because you're an old grump.

596
00:59:18,233 --> 00:59:20,383
We did a pretty good job.

597
00:59:20,913 --> 00:59:22,312
Uh-huh.

598
00:59:22,793 --> 00:59:25,785
Now we can order furniture
and major appliances.

599
01:00:14,673 --> 01:00:16,186
Well, Dennis...

600
01:00:16,313 --> 01:00:18,622
-your mother did not arrive.
-Nope.

601
01:00:19,673 --> 01:00:21,982
This is an important event for me.

602
01:00:22,273 --> 01:00:23,388
l know.

603
01:00:23,553 --> 01:00:25,145
l don't want any nonsense.

604
01:00:25,233 --> 01:00:28,543
You mind whatever manners you have
and don't be a pest.

605
01:00:28,633 --> 01:00:29,543
Okay.

606
01:00:29,633 --> 01:00:31,351
Don't embarrass me.

607
01:00:31,433 --> 01:00:32,388
Okay.

608
01:00:34,473 --> 01:00:35,952
Cheek pinchers.

609
01:00:40,193 --> 01:00:42,263
Look at the cute little boy.

610
01:00:45,113 --> 01:00:47,149
Are you our little host?

611
01:00:47,353 --> 01:00:49,947
The party's in the back.

612
01:00:50,753 --> 01:00:53,472
Ladies, girls, the party's in the back.

613
01:00:53,553 --> 01:00:56,989
Thank you very much.
lt's just this way, thank you.

614
01:00:57,513 --> 01:00:59,185
Don't embarrass me.

616

Gather over here, please.

617
01:01:07,033 --> 01:01:10,264
Have a seat.
lt's time to begin the ceremony.

618
01:01:10,713 --> 01:01:12,908
All right, members, don't be timid.

619
01:01:12,993 --> 01:01:15,302
Move down front. Plenty of seats.

620
01:01:15,433 --> 01:01:17,344

Forty years ago...

632
01:01:54,633 --> 01:01:57,750
when l started this garden,
l planted a seed.

633
01:01:59,193 --> 01:02:01,184
From that tiny seed...

634
01:02:02,193 --> 01:02:04,104
grew this grand plant.

in its entire life, it will blossom.

George, don't start, George.

642

Could you get somebody
to come and clear this away?

01:02:55,473 --> 01:02:57,031
l made a mistake.

644
01:04:47,113 --> 01:04:48,626
Mr. Wilson!

645
01:04:49,513 --> 01:04:51,504
Somebody robbed your house.

646
01:05:13,713 --> 01:05:16,352
Forty years down the drain.

647
01:05:31,793 --> 01:05:33,670
You're a pest.

648
01:05:33,753 --> 01:05:34,981
A menace.

649
01:05:35,273 --> 01:05:38,663
A selfish, spoiled little boy
and l have no use for you.

650
01:05:39,953 --> 01:05:42,911
You took something from me
that l can never get back.

651
01:05:42,993 --> 01:05:45,587
Something that means more to me
than you ever will.

652
01:05:45,873 --> 01:05:47,352
You understand?

653
01:05:48,393 --> 01:05:50,907
l don't want to see you.
l don't want to know you.

654
01:05:52,513 --> 01:05:54,105
Get out of my way.

655
01:05:57,553 --> 01:05:59,464
l'm sorry, Mr. Wilson.

656
01:06:01,113 --> 01:06:03,911
Party's over, everybody. Go on home.

657
01:06:03,993 --> 01:06:05,267
l'm sorry.

658
01:06:48,993 --> 01:06:50,824
Oh, my God!

659
01:06:53,313 --> 01:06:54,541
Where's Dennis?

660
01:07:37,313 --> 01:07:39,463
Joey hasn't seen him all night?

661
01:07:41,193 --> 01:07:42,228
Okay.

662
01:07:42,313 --> 01:07:44,781
Well, if he shows up, please call me.

663
01:07:45,353 --> 01:07:46,308
'Bye.

664
01:07:53,713 --> 01:07:56,102
-Did you call the Wades?
-Yes.

665
01:07:56,313 --> 01:07:58,986
But that's the last place he'd go.

666
01:08:05,393 --> 01:08:07,827
Don't you ever come back here again.

667
01:08:08,633 --> 01:08:10,066
He's a menace.

668
01:08:11,353 --> 01:08:12,786
Turn that off!

669
01:08:13,513 --> 01:08:16,744
Don't make a pest oo yourselo
and don't embarrass me.

670
01:08:18,153 --> 01:08:21,509
l don't want to know you.
l don't want to see you.

671
01:08:21,593 --> 01:08:23,265
Get out oo my way.

672
01:08:36,433 --> 01:08:38,549
These woods are pretty scary at night.

673
01:08:38,633 --> 01:08:40,908
l'm sure glad l ran into a grownup.

674
01:08:41,073 --> 01:08:42,984
lt'll work out real nice.

675
01:08:43,353 --> 01:08:45,913
-You can be my hostage.
-Cool!

676
01:08:47,433 --> 01:08:49,947
l can only be your hostage till tomorrow.

677
01:08:50,353 --> 01:08:52,264
l have church in the morning.

678
01:08:54,233 --> 01:08:56,189
You ain't going to church.

679
01:08:56,713 --> 01:08:59,785
You and me are catching
the midnight train out of here.

680
01:08:59,873 --> 01:09:00,828
Really?

681
01:09:01,353 --> 01:09:04,868
We better stop at my house first.
l have to tell my mom and dad...

682
01:09:04,953 --> 01:09:06,068
or else they'll worry.

683
01:09:06,153 --> 01:09:09,065
And l must get clean underwear
and my camera...

684
01:09:09,473 --> 01:09:12,146
and tell my parents to feed my fish...

685
01:09:12,233 --> 01:09:13,552
some sun block...

686
01:09:13,633 --> 01:09:17,785
and vitamins and stuff to play with
on the train so l don't get bored.

687
01:09:17,873 --> 01:09:20,103
Put a cork in it.
You're giving me a headache.

688
01:09:20,193 --> 01:09:21,148
l don't have a cork.

689
01:09:21,233 --> 01:09:22,791
Shut your mouth!

690
01:09:23,113 --> 01:09:25,866
l can't because my nose is stuffy
because of my allergies.

691
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:27,705
lf l shut my mouth, l can't breathe good.

692
01:09:27,793 --> 01:09:30,512
Then keep your mouth open,
but don't talk!

693
01:09:32,513 --> 01:09:35,664
Where do you put the cork
when you put a cork in it?

694
01:09:36,553 --> 01:09:38,384
Didn't l ask you to shut your yap?

695
01:09:38,473 --> 01:09:40,509
What's a yap?

696
01:09:41,513 --> 01:09:42,662
lt's your mouth.

697
01:09:42,753 --> 01:09:45,426
l can't shut my mouth
because my nose is stuffy.

698
01:09:45,513 --> 01:09:46,707
Shut up!

699
01:09:55,993 --> 01:09:57,904
l have one more question.

700
01:09:59,593 --> 01:10:00,662
What?

701
01:10:01,153 --> 01:10:03,348
What does a hostage have to do?

702
01:10:03,753 --> 01:10:04,822
Nothing.

703
01:10:04,913 --> 01:10:06,141
How come you need one?

704
01:10:07,033 --> 01:10:09,183
ln case the cops show up.

705
01:10:09,713 --> 01:10:11,146
Do l get to use a gun?

706
01:10:11,233 --> 01:10:14,509
You get to stand in front of me
if the cops use a gun.

707
01:10:16,793 --> 01:10:18,511
l've got a slingshot.

708
01:10:19,513 --> 01:10:20,502
Swell.

709
01:10:20,593 --> 01:10:22,709
l'm a good shot. Want to see?

710
01:10:24,873 --> 01:10:28,183
Excuse me, mister. Do you want to see?

711
01:10:29,513 --> 01:10:32,027
Mister, can you watch me for a minute?

712
01:10:35,153 --> 01:10:37,189
l'll tell you when to look.

713
01:10:45,913 --> 01:10:47,028
Look!

714
01:10:51,153 --> 01:10:53,269
Your fire's getting puny.

715
01:10:55,113 --> 01:10:59,265
When my dad's fire gets puny,
he wiggles it around and it gets bigger.

716
01:11:43,473 --> 01:11:44,462
Dennis!

717
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:56,627
Dennis!

718
01:11:59,473 --> 01:12:02,624
l'm sorry
you're not having a very fun camping trip.

719
01:12:04,193 --> 01:12:07,424
Nobody shoots a marble at my head...

720
01:12:07,513 --> 01:12:09,344
and sets my pants on fire.

721
01:12:09,753 --> 01:12:11,027
That was an accident.

722
01:12:11,113 --> 01:12:13,832
There ain't going to be no more accidents!

723
01:12:14,473 --> 01:12:15,826
Turn around!

724
01:12:26,593 --> 01:12:28,345
You're doing it wrong.

725
01:12:28,513 --> 01:12:29,707
Get lost.

726
01:12:30,233 --> 01:12:32,542
l tied up lots of guys in my life.

727
01:12:32,793 --> 01:12:36,103
l bet you've never tied up a 5-year-old.
l'll just get out.

728
01:12:36,193 --> 01:12:38,991
l'll tie it so tight
you won't be able to move.

729
01:12:39,073 --> 01:12:42,270
The rope's too big and my legs are
too small to make it tight enough.

730
01:12:42,873 --> 01:12:44,943
There's only one way to do it
and l know because...

731
01:12:45,033 --> 01:12:47,831
many people have tried to tie me up
but it doesn't work.

732
01:12:47,913 --> 01:12:49,187
But you try your way.

733
01:12:49,273 --> 01:12:51,912
l'll get out
and you'll just have to keep doing it.

734
01:12:59,673 --> 01:13:01,152
What do you do differently?

735
01:13:06,033 --> 01:13:09,503
First, you must tie up each leg by itself.

736
01:13:09,953 --> 01:13:11,989
Then you tie them together.

737
01:13:28,633 --> 01:13:31,750
No matter how much l wiggle,
l can't ever get out.

738
01:13:33,753 --> 01:13:36,347
lf you really don't want me
to move at all....

739
01:13:43,073 --> 01:13:44,347
Bend down.

740
01:13:48,753 --> 01:13:50,869
You can't get out of that at all, right?

741
01:13:55,153 --> 01:13:55,903
Nope.

742
01:13:55,993 --> 01:14:00,430
You tie me up like that, no matter
how much l try, l can't ever get out.

743
01:14:00,673 --> 01:14:01,628
Thanks.

744
01:14:03,113 --> 01:14:05,183
-Now let me loose.
-Okay.

745
01:14:05,513 --> 01:14:06,787
Get the handcuff key.

746
01:14:06,873 --> 01:14:08,909
-Where is it?
-On my bag.

747
01:14:32,473 --> 01:14:33,508
What?

748
01:14:37,633 --> 01:14:38,782
Dennis!

749
01:14:42,553 --> 01:14:43,588
Dennis!

750
01:14:55,113 --> 01:14:56,546
l'm going to kill you.

751
01:14:56,633 --> 01:14:58,828
How? You can't move. Open up.

752
01:14:59,313 --> 01:15:00,792
l ain't hungry!

753
01:15:01,073 --> 01:15:03,348
lt's the only way to get the key.

754
01:15:03,513 --> 01:15:05,231
You can't waste food.

755
01:15:05,393 --> 01:15:07,588
Plus, you must eat your dinner.

756
01:15:10,473 --> 01:15:11,667
Come on.

757
01:15:11,993 --> 01:15:13,312
Come on.

758
01:15:15,793 --> 01:15:17,226
lt's coming.

759
01:15:25,873 --> 01:15:27,022
Too hot?

760
01:15:44,433 --> 01:15:46,549
You must have swallowed it.

761
01:15:49,753 --> 01:15:51,584
l swallowed my allowance once.

762
01:15:51,673 --> 01:15:54,904
l had to wait a whole night and a day
to get it back.

763
01:16:05,433 --> 01:16:06,388
Dennis!

764
01:16:55,473 --> 01:16:57,782
Firewood. Bombs away!

765
01:17:14,513 --> 01:17:16,424
Poor little lamb.

766
01:17:16,753 --> 01:17:18,983
He must be exhausted.

767
01:17:19,073 --> 01:17:23,066
l better cover him up
so he doesn't catch his death of cold.

768
01:18:10,113 --> 01:18:11,466
There we go.

769
01:18:39,113 --> 01:18:41,069
What's he got a purse for?

770
01:18:47,193 --> 01:18:48,546
Holy smokes!

771
01:18:48,913 --> 01:18:50,187
He's rich!

772
01:19:04,273 --> 01:19:05,752
Don't worry, l got it!

773
01:19:05,833 --> 01:19:08,028
l got it! l got it!

774
01:19:51,473 --> 01:19:52,872
Dennis!

775
01:19:55,433 --> 01:19:57,867
l've lost the only man l ever loved.

776
01:20:09,113 --> 01:20:10,865
l'll get you out of there.

777
01:20:10,953 --> 01:20:14,662
You shouldn't jump in a river
with handcuffs on, for God's sake!

778
01:20:15,553 --> 01:20:17,066
You could drown.

779
01:20:25,073 --> 01:20:27,029
Hold on. l'm coming.

780
01:20:30,793 --> 01:20:32,146
Hey, mister!

781
01:20:33,353 --> 01:20:36,265
Good thing l know a lot about ropes, huh?

782
01:20:41,193 --> 01:20:42,626
That's my boy!

783
01:20:42,753 --> 01:20:45,313
Mr. Wilson taught me how to tie knots.

784
01:20:45,433 --> 01:20:49,221
When l get you out, l'm going to bed.
l'm beat.

785
01:20:50,153 --> 01:20:52,189
lt must be all the fresh air.

786
01:20:55,313 --> 01:20:57,031
Hold on, l'm coming.

787
01:21:06,313 --> 01:21:09,988
There you go. Now just pull yourself in.

788
01:21:56,393 --> 01:21:58,304
This is Mr. Wilson's gold.

789
01:21:59,553 --> 01:22:02,147
-How come you got it?
-l stole it.

790
01:22:02,633 --> 01:22:03,907
You're a robber?

791
01:22:03,993 --> 01:22:05,108
l'm a thief.

792
01:22:07,393 --> 01:22:09,668
Say your prayers, little rat!

793
01:22:09,833 --> 01:22:12,108
l can't. l didn't take my bath yet.

794
01:22:12,193 --> 01:22:13,945
Have it your own way.

795
01:24:22,273 --> 01:24:23,228
Martha!

796
01:24:23,553 --> 01:24:24,508
Mitchell!

797
01:24:35,633 --> 01:24:37,863
Hey, Mr. Wilson!

798
01:24:56,233 --> 01:24:57,746
-Guess what?
-What?

799
01:24:59,553 --> 01:25:01,305
l got your gold back.

800
01:25:03,073 --> 01:25:04,028
Dennis!

801
01:25:06,953 --> 01:25:08,864
Mom! Dad!

802
01:25:10,113 --> 01:25:13,662
Oh, sweetheart! Thank God, you're okay.

803
01:25:25,953 --> 01:25:27,102
Help.

804
01:25:45,913 --> 01:25:48,791
This is my buddy. This is my pal.

805
01:25:59,473 --> 01:26:00,428
Wait a minute.

806
01:26:00,513 --> 01:26:04,472
You can tell everybody at the big house
you met our Dennis Mitchell.

807
01:26:06,993 --> 01:26:08,665
All right. Let's wrap it up.

808
01:26:12,553 --> 01:26:13,508
Mister.

809
01:26:15,193 --> 01:26:17,070
You forgot something.

810
01:26:21,953 --> 01:26:22,908
Dennis!

811
01:26:47,673 --> 01:26:49,868
l like that rhubarb pie that Martha makes.

812
01:26:49,953 --> 01:26:52,592
-Wonderful dinner.
-Thank you, Henry.

813
01:26:52,993 --> 01:26:54,665
Alice, your coffee.

814
01:26:57,433 --> 01:26:58,502
Guess what?

815
01:26:58,593 --> 01:27:00,231
l won't have to travel anymore.

816
01:27:00,313 --> 01:27:01,666
That's nice.

817
01:27:01,873 --> 01:27:04,068
They want me to work on the project here.

818
01:27:04,153 --> 01:27:07,589
They agreed to start a daycare center
so l can take Dennis with me to work.

819
01:27:07,673 --> 01:27:09,265
That's ridiculous!

820
01:27:09,873 --> 01:27:12,182
What the heck's he going to do all day?

821
01:27:12,273 --> 01:27:13,831
Don't be foolish.

822
01:27:13,913 --> 01:27:16,871
We're right next door. We can watch him.

823
01:27:18,113 --> 01:27:20,229
Well, of course. We'd love to.

824
01:27:20,313 --> 01:27:22,543
l don't think....

825
01:27:22,713 --> 01:27:26,945
l mean, you must remember back
to all the times Dennis upset you.

826
01:27:27,593 --> 01:27:30,790
This is a new ball game.
l've learned a few things.

827
01:27:30,873 --> 01:27:31,988
Kids are kids.

828
01:27:33,073 --> 01:27:35,268
You have to play by their rules.

829
01:27:35,633 --> 01:27:38,022
lf you can't do that, you're in trouble.

830
01:27:38,113 --> 01:27:40,069
You must roll with the punches.

831
01:27:40,153 --> 01:27:42,383
You must expect the unexpected.

832
01:28:06,633 --> 01:28:10,103
Aren't you supposed to be in
the daycare area with the other children?

833
01:28:11,193 --> 01:28:13,343
That's where l was, but l had to leave.

834
01:28:13,473 --> 01:28:15,384
The lady who watches the kids said...

835
01:28:15,473 --> 01:28:18,431
if she had to look at me
for five more seconds...

836
01:28:18,513 --> 01:28:21,186
she'd jump out the window.

837
01:28:22,113 --> 01:28:23,785
She's a pretty nice lady...

838
01:28:23,993 --> 01:28:25,904
so l wouldn't want her to do that.

839
01:28:28,833 --> 01:28:30,551
Can l push the button?

840
01:28:30,633 --> 01:28:33,227
No, because you don't know
which button to push.

841
01:28:45,513 --> 01:28:47,151
lt's this one!

842
01:28:56,793 --> 01:28:58,545
l'm going to get this little kid!

843
01:32:16,137 --> 01:32:18,526
Hey, Mr. Wilson!

844
01:32:19,305 --> 01:32:25,875
