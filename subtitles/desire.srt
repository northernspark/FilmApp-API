Now listen, Mr. Gibson.

00:02:04,287 --> 00:02:07,006
You#re not going to stop me
and no one else is going to stop me.

4
00:02:07,087 --> 00:02:09,647
L#m going on this vacation
whether you like it or not!

5
00:02:09,727 --> 00:02:12,161
And if you want to throw me out,
why don#t you?

6
00:02:13,247 --> 00:02:15,203
Yes, you know l#m right.

7
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:19,283
Now don#t bring up any arguments like that.

8
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:23,597
Yes, you brought me here from Detroit,
but you didn#t do it for my sake.

9
00:02:23,687 --> 00:02:27,123
You did it because you wanted
a good engineer, and l#ve done a swell job.

10
00:02:28,487 --> 00:02:29,966
Now, let me tell you, Mr. Gibson...

11
00:02:30,047 --> 00:02:32,925
l#m not going back to Detroit
before I have my vacation...

12
00:02:33,007 --> 00:02:37,125
and if you don#t like it, you can take my job
and you know what you can do with it?

13
00:02:37,207 --> 00:02:38,276
Right.

14
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,278
Mr. Gibson wants to see you.

15
00:02:41,007 --> 00:02:42,725
Tell him l#II be right in.

16
00:02:43,567 --> 00:02:45,205
Yes, Mr. Bradley.

17
00:02:51,807 --> 00:02:53,877
- Well, Mr. Gibson?
- Well, Mr. Bradley?

18
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:55,844
It#s all right. You can have your vacation.

Well, thank you, Mr. Gibson.

You don#t have to thank me.
You#ve done a swell job...

22
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,843
and let me tell you,
you#re a very fine engineer.

23
00:03:04,927 --> 00:03:06,758
Everyone in Detroit recognises that.

24
00:03:07,447 --> 00:03:09,483
Well, they don#t know much in Detroit.

25
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:12,206
Enough to like your ideas
about the new carburettor very much.

26
00:03:12,287 --> 00:03:14,482
They want you back home
by the 15th at the latest.

27
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:15,556
- The 15th?
- Yeah.

28
00:03:15,647 --> 00:03:18,081
- Well, that... That gives me two weeks.
- That#s right.

Where are you going?

30
00:03:21,127 --> 00:03:22,719
- Spain.
- Spain, huh?

31
00:03:22,807 --> 00:03:24,877
L#ve always wanted to go there,
ever since I was a kid.

L#ve read every book about Spain.

BRADLEY: What car?
GIBSON: I forgot to tell you.

39
00:03:44,287 --> 00:03:46,323
To show you
how much we appreciate your services...

40
00:03:46,407 --> 00:03:48,716
- we#re lending you a car for your trip.
- Well, that#s great!

41
00:03:48,807 --> 00:03:51,367
But we thought we might as well utilise you
for a little publicity.

42
00:03:51,447 --> 00:03:53,836
You won#t mind using one of these signs
on the car, will you?

43
00:03:53,927 --> 00:03:55,883
- No.
- Let#s see which one is the best.

44
00:04:01,127 --> 00:04:05,359
- It#s difficult to decide.
- It must be tough, Mr. Gibson, very tough.

That#s the trouble. It#s too snooty.

54
00:04:31,207 --> 00:04:33,675
People who make under a $100 a week
are never delighted.

55

They#re tickled to death,

That#s no good, either.
##Glad## is a weak word.

00:04:41,967 --> 00:04:45,801
For instance, l#m walking down
the boulevard and just looking around...

##Glad to see you, Mr. Gibson. ##

I tell you, ##glad## is the wrong word.

Well, take another example.

and I don#t like her anymore...

l#m glad to get rid of her.

Not at all, madame. Modern psychiatry
has a way of dealing with these problems.

Now shall we make an appointment for him?

163
00:12:01,807 --> 00:12:05,243
That#s not so easy to do.
He has grown so suspicious of people.

The commonest of symptoms.

and he found others around...

Doctor, there#s one other thing.

I don#t know how important it is, but I think
I should mention it before you see him.

and to people he never even met before.

I wouldn#t be a bit surprised if he comes
in here and presents you with a bill.

You#re going to Spain. L#m going to Spain.

308

L#m on a vacation and it doesn#t make
any difference where I go, right?

309
00:24:50,727 --> 00:24:53,560
But look, let#s agree on one thing.
Let#s not go so fast.

310
00:24:53,647 --> 00:24:57,356
Let#s take our time and see the mountains
and the little villages and enjoy it.

311
00:24:58,527 --> 00:25:00,199
People will wait for you.

312
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:02,556
I would.

313
00:25:03,007 --> 00:25:05,760
I want to apologise
for all the trouble I have caused you...

314
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:08,317
and to thank you
for all the help you#ve given me...

315
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:11,001
but I must insist that you do not follow me.

316
00:25:11,687 --> 00:25:15,316
And if you would do me a special favour,
please leave me alone, right now.

317
00:25:15,767 --> 00:25:16,802
L#m sorry.

Get your luggage ready for inspection.
Step inside the Customs Building.

There#s something wrong with my car.
I wonder if you can help me.

328
00:28:51,007 --> 00:28:52,565
Well, l#II have a look at it.

329
00:28:55,087 --> 00:28:57,237
Well, how did this happen?

330
00:28:57,487 --> 00:28:59,523
I must have bumped over a big rock.

331
00:29:01,167 --> 00:29:03,397
I don#t see how it could have happened
that way.

332
00:29:06,607 --> 00:29:09,883
Maybe when you were fixing the horn
you accidentally broke something.

333
00:29:09,967 --> 00:29:11,286
I beg your pardon?

L#m a motor engineer.
I build motors, not wreck them.

Well, there#s nothing I can do
without any spare parts.

336
00:29:19,207 --> 00:29:22,563
- What are you going to do?
- Just leave it here and send for it tomorrow.

337
00:29:23,927 --> 00:29:25,599
Will you give me a lift?

338
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,602
Aren#t you a bit cold driving without a coat?

339
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:51,120
I should say not.

Do you think
our luggage is safe back there?

Who cares? Nothing#s safe in this car.

- But...
- Don#t you worry, I put yours on the bottom.

If you hear anything fall, it#s my suitcase.
You have nothing to worry about.

instead of being on my way
to San Sebastian.

Is that where we#re going?

It#s just what l#d always hoped
and dreamed for my vacation.

What a vacation.
Do you know what I wish would happen?

362
00:31:03,567 --> 00:31:05,558
You#d lose your suitcase.
L#d lose my suitcase.

and both be stranded here for 10 days...

I can#t help it, that#s what I wish.

I may get one, too, being so close to you.

You know, it#s getting colder
as it gets later...

and I might have to move a little closer
if I get chilly.

Of course. But do you think
it goes with those trousers?

- He was tall.

The gentleman who wanted to see
the Countess, was he an American...

463
00:39:57,887 --> 00:40:01,721
Who? A gentleman
from the police department?

464
00:40:02,887 --> 00:40:04,161
It#s the police.

465
00:40:06,367 --> 00:40:08,437
Well, I told you, madame is not receiving.

466
00:40:12,447 --> 00:40:14,119
All right, send him up.

467
00:40:16,727 --> 00:40:19,321
Now let#s be calm.
All we can get is five years.

468
00:40:19,407 --> 00:40:20,840
No, seven. I looked it up.

469
00:40:20,927 --> 00:40:23,236
Now, remember,
a slip-up now would be fatal.

470
00:40:23,327 --> 00:40:25,921
Our stories have got to match.
Now, let#s go over it again quickly.

471
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:27,235
- Who am I?
- You#re my uncle.

472
00:40:27,327 --> 00:40:29,795
- How did I get this bullet hole in my ribs?
- Battle on the Marne.

473
00:40:29,887 --> 00:40:31,479
- Who was your mother?
- Grand Duchess Sandra...

474
00:40:31,567 --> 00:40:32,841
- who went down on the Lusitania.
- Right.

475
00:40:32,927 --> 00:40:36,715
- And your father was the Grand Duke Sergei.
- Killed by the Bolsheviks. I know it.

476
00:40:37,087 --> 00:40:39,203
- Good luck, Madeleine.
- Good luck, Carlos.

477
00:40:39,367 --> 00:40:41,085
- Remember.
- Your Highness.

478
00:40:41,167 --> 00:40:42,395
Come in.

479
00:40:53,207 --> 00:40:55,641
Do I have the pleasure
of addressing Countess de Beaupre?

480
00:40:55,727 --> 00:40:56,762
Yes.

481
00:40:56,847 --> 00:41:01,045
May I introduce myself? My name is Avilia,
from the San Sebastian Police Department.

482
00:41:01,487 --> 00:41:03,603
- Won#t you sit down?
- Thank you.

483
00:41:06,207 --> 00:41:07,196
[Knocking at door]

484
00:41:07,647 --> 00:41:08,921
Come in.

485
00:41:12,767 --> 00:41:14,120
Thank you.

486
00:41:14,567 --> 00:41:17,365
- Will you excuse me for a minute?
- Certainly, Countess.

487
00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:29,677
Lord Dunsmore wants us to join him
on a Mediterranean cruise.

488
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:46,646
I beg your pardon. I was so interested
in reading about this case.

489
00:41:46,727 --> 00:41:48,319
You mean the one about the pearl necklace?

490
00:41:48,407 --> 00:41:49,840
I don#t know how it got in the papers.

491
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:52,395
It just makes it
so much more difficult for me.

492
00:41:52,487 --> 00:41:54,637
The woman in the case
seems to be very clever.

493
00:41:54,727 --> 00:41:59,084
Yes, but what makes it so difficult for me
is that her description varies.

494
00:41:59,647 --> 00:42:03,242
It#s one of those typical cases
where one has to take a chance.

495
00:42:03,767 --> 00:42:05,837
Well, senor, you#II excuse me.

496
00:42:05,927 --> 00:42:07,599
I have an appointment at my hairdresser#s.

497
00:42:07,687 --> 00:42:09,279
Now, Countess...

498
00:42:10,607 --> 00:42:14,077
It#s so silly, but as I told you,
I have to do my duty.

499
00:42:15,647 --> 00:42:19,037
You see, this afternoon
an American arrived by plane...

500
00:42:19,367 --> 00:42:22,518
and he has made a complaint.
Oh, a fantastic story!

501
00:42:22,607 --> 00:42:24,643
A woman took his car and wrecked it.

502
00:42:24,727 --> 00:42:26,683
He#s taken up so much of my time.

503
00:42:26,767 --> 00:42:30,885
But he threatened to go
to the American Consul, so I had no choice.

504
00:42:30,967 --> 00:42:35,199
I had to take the case in my hands.
What could I do? I am the police.

505
00:42:35,807 --> 00:42:40,278
We made the rounds of all the hotels,
Countess, but the description...

506
00:42:40,367 --> 00:42:41,482
Fits me?

507
00:42:41,607 --> 00:42:44,963
Well, it#s absurd, Countess, but it does.

508
00:42:45,327 --> 00:42:47,477
Furthermore, you arrived this afternoon.

509
00:42:47,567 --> 00:42:50,718
It#s all such nonsense, but everything fits.

510
00:42:50,967 --> 00:42:53,322
Now l#m forced to confront you
with this American...

511
00:42:53,407 --> 00:42:55,204
but, of course,
if you will assure me that you...

512
00:42:55,287 --> 00:42:58,836
- Oh, no. I insist on seeing this young man.
- Absolutely.

513
00:43:00,207 --> 00:43:02,596
A thousand thanks. L#II bring him right up.

514
00:43:02,687 --> 00:43:05,679
No. He#s taken up too much of your time
already. Just send him up.

515
00:43:05,767 --> 00:43:08,281
- L#m so delighted to have met you, senor.
- Thank you.

516
00:43:08,367 --> 00:43:10,358
- Don#t bother to bring him up here.
- Yes, Countess.

517
00:43:10,447 --> 00:43:13,041
- Allow me.
- Your Highness, you are so kind to me.

518
00:43:13,127 --> 00:43:14,480
It was so nice of you to come up.

519
00:43:17,527 --> 00:43:19,119
Give me a drink, quick.

520
00:43:21,047 --> 00:43:23,083
Now we#II have to get those pearls.

521
00:43:28,487 --> 00:43:29,761
Come in.

522
00:43:34,967 --> 00:43:36,480
So it was you!

523
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:41,756
Say, what was the idea
of taking my car and...

524
00:43:42,887 --> 00:43:44,081
Hello.

525
00:43:48,247 --> 00:43:50,238
May I ask what this is all about?

526
00:43:50,407 --> 00:43:52,637
This is my uncle, Prince Margoli.

527
00:43:53,607 --> 00:43:55,279
Bradley#s my name.

528
00:43:55,367 --> 00:43:58,723
- Are you insinuating that my niece...
- Yes, I am. She stole my car.

529
00:43:58,807 --> 00:44:00,035
That#s not true.

530
00:44:01,247 --> 00:44:02,839
Are you calling me a liar?

531
00:44:03,247 --> 00:44:05,078
I say that could not be true.

532
00:44:05,487 --> 00:44:07,523
Uncle, it is true.

533
00:44:10,647 --> 00:44:14,720
Then you really did what the police and
what this young man accuse you of doing?

534
00:44:14,807 --> 00:44:17,879
- Yes. But let me explain.
- There is no explanation.

535
00:44:17,967 --> 00:44:19,844
There#s got to be an explanation.

536
00:44:20,327 --> 00:44:23,319
That car didn#t even belong to me,
and somebody#s got to pay for it.

537
00:44:23,407 --> 00:44:24,840
Let that be the least of your worries.

538
00:44:24,927 --> 00:44:27,282
You#II have the money
before you leave this room.

539
00:44:28,887 --> 00:44:30,923
- What interests me most is your conduct.
- No, Uncle...

540
00:44:31,007 --> 00:44:32,599
I don#t want any excuses!

541
00:44:32,687 --> 00:44:34,837
This is the last
of your numberless escapades.

542
00:44:34,927 --> 00:44:36,883
I shall take this up
at the family council, yes.

543
00:44:36,967 --> 00:44:39,800
L#II not let you drag down our family name
any longer.

544
00:44:39,887 --> 00:44:42,082
Do you realise what you did?

545
00:44:42,287 --> 00:44:45,563
You stole a car. You, a de Beaupre!

546
00:44:45,887 --> 00:44:48,162
- I shall see that the family disowns you.
- Now look here...

547
00:44:48,247 --> 00:44:50,602
This is a black spot
on the escutcheon of the de Beaupres...

548
00:44:50,687 --> 00:44:51,881
which will have to be wiped away.

549
00:44:51,967 --> 00:44:54,242
- But after all...
- Will you kindly let me handle this alone?

550
00:44:54,327 --> 00:44:55,680
- Now, l#m telling you...
- Please, sir.

551
00:44:55,767 --> 00:44:57,837
Whose niece is she, your niece or my niece?

552
00:44:57,927 --> 00:44:59,360
Whose car was it, your car or my car?

553
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:02,200
Now let me tell you, my niece
is more important to me than your car.

554
00:45:02,287 --> 00:45:04,721
My car is more important to me
than your niece!

555
00:45:07,207 --> 00:45:10,517
Well, I don#t know.
Well, look. L#m on my vacation...

556
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:13,167
and I don#t want any more trouble
than I had already...

557
00:45:13,247 --> 00:45:15,761
and I certainly don#t want to start
a European war. Look...

558
00:45:15,847 --> 00:45:19,601
pay me 35,000 francs for my car,
and let#s have a drink.

559
00:45:21,127 --> 00:45:23,402
I cannot treat the matter so lightly.

560
00:45:50,487 --> 00:45:54,400
Madeleine, I think the behaviour
of this young man is excellent...

561
00:45:54,487 --> 00:45:56,205
and I want you to apologise.

562
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:59,881
I ask your forgiveness
from the bottom of my heart.

563
00:46:00,887 --> 00:46:02,605
Oh, come on. That#s okay.

564
00:46:03,207 --> 00:46:04,481
Let#s have that drink.

565
00:46:09,247 --> 00:46:10,999
L#II write you the cheque at once.

566
00:46:12,567 --> 00:46:14,319
Why do you suppose she did it?

567
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:16,802
Why? Wrong education!

568
00:46:16,887 --> 00:46:18,764
That#s the trouble
with our whole aristocracy.

569
00:46:18,847 --> 00:46:22,317
Still think they#re living in the Middle Ages.
No respect for other people.

570
00:46:22,407 --> 00:46:26,559
Treating everyone like subjects.
That#s what starts revolutions.

571
00:46:27,127 --> 00:46:28,355
I guess you#re right.

572
00:46:29,487 --> 00:46:32,047
She could start a revolution
with me anytime.

573
00:46:32,127 --> 00:46:33,355
Please?

574
00:46:34,127 --> 00:46:35,560
I beg your pardon.

575
00:46:51,487 --> 00:46:55,162
If you won#t accept my apology,
let me at least thank you for your chivalry.

576
00:46:57,007 --> 00:46:59,760
It#s quite all right. Why did you do it?

577
00:47:00,007 --> 00:47:02,726
- Do you really want to know the truth?
- Yes.

578
00:47:02,887 --> 00:47:05,720
- I was very late for a luncheon appointment.
- What?

579
00:47:05,807 --> 00:47:09,117
And I wanted to keep it,
but not because of the food.

580
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:11,716
I get it.

581
00:47:11,807 --> 00:47:15,004
Why did you leave me in the middle of the
road? L#d have been glad to drive you.

582
00:47:15,087 --> 00:47:17,760
You were going slower and slower,
and you know yourself why.

583
00:47:18,247 --> 00:47:21,205
It#s very silly to say,
but suddenly I got in the most awful panic.

584
00:47:21,287 --> 00:47:23,596
I didn#t know you, we were alone there...

585
00:47:23,967 --> 00:47:26,686
and before I knew what I was doing,
I stepped on the gas.

586
00:47:27,247 --> 00:47:28,805
I was really afraid.

587
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:29,876
Of what?

588
00:47:30,167 --> 00:47:31,156
Of you.

589
00:47:36,007 --> 00:47:39,124
Well, there was no need of it.
I paid you a few compliments.

590
00:47:39,207 --> 00:47:42,119
I told you how charming
and how lovely you were...

591
00:47:42,447 --> 00:47:44,677
and l#d still repeat it,
but I didn#t do anything.

592
00:47:44,767 --> 00:47:45,995
But you intended to.

593
00:47:46,367 --> 00:47:47,402
I did not.

594
00:47:47,527 --> 00:47:48,960
You had it in your eye.

595
00:47:51,207 --> 00:47:53,118
I didn#t know it showed.

596
00:47:54,327 --> 00:47:57,239
By the way,
did you make your luncheon appointment?

597
00:47:57,327 --> 00:47:59,522
Yes, but after I got here, I didn#t keep it.

598
00:48:02,327 --> 00:48:03,316
You know...

599
00:48:04,647 --> 00:48:08,242
it may seem strange,
but l#ve never had dinner with a Countess.

600
00:48:09,767 --> 00:48:12,520
And l#m afraid you never will.
We are leaving today.

601
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:15,401
- So am I. Are you going to Madrid, too?
- No.

602
00:48:16,447 --> 00:48:17,721
Neither am I.

603
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:09,323
RADIO HOST: You will hear the news
of the day from the capitals of the world.

604
00:49:09,407 --> 00:49:10,681
Paris, France.

605
00:49:10,767 --> 00:49:13,486
The most sensational jewel robbery
of a decade...

606
00:49:13,567 --> 00:49:16,206
the disappearance of a two-million franc
string of pearls...

607
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:20,075
from Duvalle and Company,
the famous jewellers, still goes unsolved.

608
00:49:20,167 --> 00:49:22,806
The police are believed to be
closing in on the culprits.

609
00:49:22,887 --> 00:49:24,525
The latest clues point to Spain...

610
00:49:24,607 --> 00:49:26,404
as the country
where they have taken refuge...

611
00:49:26,487 --> 00:49:28,603
and the search has turned there.

612
00:49:37,247 --> 00:49:38,919
- Mr. Bradley?
- Yes?

613
00:49:39,367 --> 00:49:41,597
- Are you unpacked?
- Yeah.

614
00:49:41,767 --> 00:49:44,725
- Do you want any help?
- No, thanks, everything#s fine.

615
00:49:45,567 --> 00:49:48,843
- Do you need any suits pressed?
- No, no. That#s not really necessary.

616
00:49:49,607 --> 00:49:51,359
By the way, we#re dressing tonight.

617
00:49:54,407 --> 00:49:56,079
- You#re dressing.
- Yes.

618
00:49:56,207 --> 00:49:59,517
- I left my dinner coat in Paris.
- That#s all right. It doesn#t matter.

619
00:49:59,607 --> 00:50:01,120
- L#m sorry.
- Don#t worry.

620
00:50:01,207 --> 00:50:03,482
- Come out as soon as you#re ready.
- Thanks.

621
00:50:13,207 --> 00:50:14,196
Madeleine.

622
00:50:16,807 --> 00:50:18,798
- Has he found them?
- I don#t think so...

623
00:50:18,887 --> 00:50:20,081
but he has no dinner jacket.

624
00:50:20,167 --> 00:50:21,202
- That#s bad.
- Yes.

625
00:50:21,287 --> 00:50:24,438
Let#s hope he wears that chequered coat,
then l#II slip away from dinner.

626
00:50:24,527 --> 00:50:27,644
- And l#II keep him at the table.
- Right, but if he doesn#t wear it...

627
00:50:27,727 --> 00:50:30,605
Now we#II have to be careful.
Don#t let#s arouse any suspicion.

628
00:50:31,167 --> 00:50:34,921
- Have you any kind of a pearl necklace?
- Yes, the imitation I bought in Vienna.

629
00:50:35,007 --> 00:50:36,235
Good, put it on.

630
00:51:00,927 --> 00:51:02,360
Mr. Bradley.

631
00:51:04,087 --> 00:51:05,156
Thank you.

632
00:51:07,127 --> 00:51:09,482
You know,
I shouldn#t be allowed to sit down.

633
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:11,717
I look like a stevedore at a royal banquet.

634
00:51:12,967 --> 00:51:14,798
Here#s to our charming guest.

635
00:51:19,847 --> 00:51:24,557
And here#s to my charming host
and my very lovely hostess.

636
00:51:28,247 --> 00:51:31,557
You know, Mr. Bradley,
I never thought l#d like you.

637
00:51:32,807 --> 00:51:34,877
I knew you would. I grow on people.

638
00:51:35,607 --> 00:51:39,156
I remember a few years ago,
I met a girl that didn#t like me at first.

639
00:51:40,727 --> 00:51:43,241
But I grew and grew on her until...

640
00:51:43,527 --> 00:51:44,642
What happened?

641
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:45,762
She sued me.

642
00:51:48,327 --> 00:51:50,522
I see. You#re a kind of a Don Juan.

643
00:52:15,967 --> 00:52:17,241
What a vacation.

644
00:52:18,567 --> 00:52:19,841
What a country.

645
00:52:28,727 --> 00:52:31,002
[Singing] What is this tender sensation?

646
00:52:32,207 --> 00:52:34,880
This magical thrill that I feel?

647
00:52:36,207 --> 00:52:39,279
Although I seem to be in a dream

648
00:52:39,967 --> 00:52:42,800
I know this moment is real

649
00:52:47,007 --> 00:52:50,238
You're here and I'm here

650
00:52:50,327 --> 00:52:53,558
With your heart and my heart

651
00:52:53,647 --> 00:52:58,357
Awake in a dream

652
00:52:59,447 --> 00:53:04,202
In a dream of romance and delight

653
00:53:05,767 --> 00:53:10,761
Can it be that tonight is the night?

654
00:53:13,847 --> 00:53:16,520
You're here and I'm here

655
00:53:16,607 --> 00:53:19,883
With your lips and my lips

656
00:53:19,967 --> 00:53:24,483
Awake in a dream

657
00:53:25,727 --> 00:53:30,721
And the stars looking down from above

658
00:53:32,447 --> 00:53:35,405
Seem to sing, "You're in love

659
00:53:35,687 --> 00:53:37,518
"You're in love"

660
00:53:39,727 --> 00:53:44,596
Now I'll walk with wings on my feet

661
00:53:45,967 --> 00:53:50,836
Now I'll feel that bitter is sweet

662
00:53:51,447 --> 00:53:56,316
Other eyes may have charms

663
00:53:57,487 --> 00:54:02,083
But my heaven will be in your arms

664
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:07,558
You're here and I'm here

665
00:54:07,927 --> 00:54:10,839
With your heart and my heart

666
00:54:10,927 --> 00:54:15,318
Awake in a dream

667
00:54:17,127 --> 00:54:21,803
In a dream of romance and delight

668
00:54:23,847 --> 00:54:27,635
Can it be that tonight

669
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:30,964
Is the night?

670
00:54:33,767 --> 00:54:35,962
That was beautiful, really beautiful.

671
00:54:36,327 --> 00:54:38,283
Now you do something, Mr. Bradley.

672
00:54:39,607 --> 00:54:42,405
Well, I can walk on my hands.

673
00:54:42,647 --> 00:54:44,285
Fine. Fine.

674
00:54:45,007 --> 00:54:46,963
No, it#s much too early after dinner.

675
00:54:47,047 --> 00:54:49,641
- Uncle, why don#t you show us some tricks?
- Oh, no.

676
00:54:50,047 --> 00:54:51,196
Yes, why don#t you?

677
00:54:51,447 --> 00:54:52,436
All right.

678
00:54:54,247 --> 00:54:56,078
Now here#s a perfectly plain
linen handkerchief.

679
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:57,566
Now watch it carefully.

680
00:55:01,967 --> 00:55:04,242
Now the object of this trick
is to see how big a hole...

681
00:55:04,327 --> 00:55:05,965
we can burn in the handkerchief.

682
00:55:12,687 --> 00:55:13,722
That#s great.

683
00:55:14,087 --> 00:55:15,759
By the way, Mr. Bradley...

684
00:55:17,687 --> 00:55:20,247
do you always carry your money
in your nose?

685
00:55:21,287 --> 00:55:24,836
I don#t know,
but I very often pay through the nose.

686
00:55:25,047 --> 00:55:27,515
- Go on, do some more.
- All right, if you insist.

687
00:55:28,487 --> 00:55:30,284
May I have your pearls for a moment?

688
00:55:33,127 --> 00:55:35,721
Now, Mr. Bradley,
you see this pearl necklace?

689
00:55:36,247 --> 00:55:39,762
Now watch it very carefully.
Now, one, two, three!

690
00:55:43,207 --> 00:55:46,244
- Where#d they go?
- Look in your right-hand pocket.

691
00:55:49,207 --> 00:55:52,244
No, look in the right-hand pocket
of your coat.

692
00:56:01,567 --> 00:56:03,239
Well, how#d they get in my pocket?

693
00:56:03,567 --> 00:56:05,842
Well, I can#t tell you that, Mr. Bradley.

694
00:56:08,927 --> 00:56:11,316
- Well, I hope you#ve been entertained?
- Entertained?

695
00:56:12,167 --> 00:56:13,885
It#s a marvellous evening.

696
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:16,721
Now, Mr. Bradley,
you#ve had a very strenuous day...

697
00:56:16,807 --> 00:56:19,082
- and I should think you must be tired.
- Tired?

698
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:22,682
I should say not. I could stay up a week
under these circumstances.

699
00:56:24,527 --> 00:56:27,280
But you#re looking tired, isn#t he? Look.

700
00:56:27,567 --> 00:56:30,718
You#ve been very kind and I don#t want you
to put yourself out too much.

701
00:56:30,807 --> 00:56:33,605
You#re right. It is getting late,
and if you want to go to bed...

702
00:56:33,687 --> 00:56:36,121
why, don#t let your European etiquette
stand in the way.

703
00:56:36,207 --> 00:56:39,517
If you#re tired, why,
just go and lay the body down.

704
00:56:39,887 --> 00:56:43,596
All right, then l#II do my last trick
of the evening and make myself disappear.

705
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:45,725
- Good night.
- Good night.

706
00:56:46,127 --> 00:56:47,958
- Good night, Mr. Bradley.
- Good night.

707
00:56:49,247 --> 00:56:50,600
- Good night.
- Good night.

708
00:56:54,407 --> 00:56:55,635
Good night!

709
00:56:56,207 --> 00:56:57,276
Good night.

710
00:57:01,447 --> 00:57:04,439
Well, I guess this is
what#s known as being alone at last.

711
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:08,481
- Madeleine?
- L#II be right back.

712
00:57:12,247 --> 00:57:13,396
Yes?

713
00:57:13,487 --> 00:57:16,877
L#m sorry to interrupt this serenade,
but I really wish you#d go to bed.

714
00:57:17,087 --> 00:57:20,079
- Carlos, don#t be foolish.
- Don#t you be foolish.

715
00:57:20,167 --> 00:57:21,600
And don#t encourage him to stay here.

716
00:57:21,687 --> 00:57:24,042
We#ve got to get rid of him
as soon as possible.

717
00:57:24,367 --> 00:57:26,801
And please, no emotional entanglements.

718
00:57:27,407 --> 00:57:31,446
It#s dangerous, Madeleine, at this moment.
So go to bed at once, please.

719
00:57:39,527 --> 00:57:42,121
I didn#t realise how tired I am.
I think l#II go to bed.

720
00:57:42,207 --> 00:57:43,606
Oh, come on.

721
00:57:43,887 --> 00:57:46,481
Please stay a while, just a few minutes.

722
00:58:00,487 --> 00:58:01,681
Please.

723
00:58:04,767 --> 00:58:05,756
You know...

724
00:58:07,247 --> 00:58:10,603
all you need is a frame now
and you#d be a masterpiece.

725
00:58:12,727 --> 00:58:15,002
All I need is a nice, soft bed.

726
00:58:17,847 --> 00:58:21,442
You must realise that l#ve never been
with anyone like you before.

727
00:58:23,687 --> 00:58:26,645
It sounds funny,
but I don#t seem to be able to entertain you.

728
00:58:28,367 --> 00:58:31,803
I hate to be entertained. Please don#t do it.

729
00:58:33,807 --> 00:58:35,035
Well...

730
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:40,881
Look, where I come from,
l#m not considered exactly bashful...

731
00:58:41,967 --> 00:58:44,435
and if I were home and you were...

732
00:58:44,767 --> 00:58:47,406
Lizzie Smith, or Susie Brown,
or Mary Jones...

733
00:58:47,487 --> 00:58:48,966
What would you do?

734
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,995
Oh, boy, what...

735
00:58:54,247 --> 00:58:56,283
We wouldn#t be sitting here...

736
00:58:56,807 --> 00:58:59,765
Well, l#m glad l#m not Mary Jones...

737
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:03,005
or Lizzie Smith...

738
00:59:05,207 --> 00:59:06,925
or Susie Brown.

739
00:59:54,927 --> 00:59:56,838
L#m crazy about you, Madeleine.

740
00:59:57,447 --> 01:00:00,996
Madeleine. You don#t know
how l#ve wanted to call you that.

741
01:00:02,407 --> 01:00:03,965
Madeleine, I love you.

742
01:00:04,607 --> 01:00:06,882
It#s hit me all of a sudden. I love you.

743
01:00:07,367 --> 01:00:11,997
And when you wake up, l#m gonna take you
in my arms and l#m going to kiss you.

744
01:00:12,607 --> 01:00:14,962
L#m going to tell you that...

745
01:00:17,367 --> 01:00:19,756
Did you say something, Mr. Bradley?

746
01:00:24,127 --> 01:00:25,799
No, nothing.

747
01:00:29,727 --> 01:00:32,241
Well, good night.

748
01:00:43,167 --> 01:00:44,759
[Police sirens wailing]

749
01:01:17,607 --> 01:01:19,279
Calm yourself, Madeleine.

750
01:01:20,727 --> 01:01:23,366
You see, it was nothing. You#re too nervous.

751
01:01:23,727 --> 01:01:28,642
Why shouldn#t I be? How could I help it?
Hunted, chased every moment.

752
01:01:29,167 --> 01:01:33,479
Never knowing when they#II get us.
It#s a wonderful life, Carlos, isn#t it?

753
01:01:33,807 --> 01:01:36,401
Every time the door opens,
not knowing who#s coming in.

754
01:01:37,087 --> 01:01:39,840
They#II get us, Carlos.
Sooner or later, they will.

755
01:01:40,127 --> 01:01:43,597
Now, now. Go to bed, Madeleine.

756
01:01:45,847 --> 01:01:47,200
You need a good rest.

757
01:01:47,767 --> 01:01:50,725
Sleep! Who knows
how many days we#ve left.

758
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:53,796
Maybe tomorrow, maybe tonight.

759
01:01:56,807 --> 01:01:57,876
Good night.

760
01:01:58,687 --> 01:01:59,915
Good night, Madeleine.

761
01:02:14,407 --> 01:02:18,195
You#re still up? Is anything the matter?

762
01:02:19,007 --> 01:02:20,122
Nervous.

763
01:02:21,207 --> 01:02:22,720
Why should you be nervous?

764
01:02:24,967 --> 01:02:28,642
I don#t know. I didn#t know I had a nerve
in my body until tonight.

765
01:02:43,487 --> 01:02:45,682
Why don#t you go to bed
and get a good rest?

766
01:02:46,567 --> 01:02:49,559
I tried to, but that Spanish moon...

767
01:02:50,527 --> 01:02:54,839
You see him up there? Strong, isn#t it?
It was shining right into my window.

768
01:02:55,407 --> 01:02:56,999
Why don#t you draw the curtain?

769
01:02:58,087 --> 01:03:01,716
I see. Turn off the moon,
turn on the moon, just as you like.

770
01:03:02,447 --> 01:03:04,403
Some people can do that easier than others.

771
01:03:05,007 --> 01:03:09,125
- Aren#t you a bit hasty, Mr. Bradley?
- Maybe I am. L#m sorry.

772
01:03:09,807 --> 01:03:11,399
You see...

773
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:14,001
But you wouldn#t understand, anyway.
How could you?

774
01:03:14,567 --> 01:03:16,717
This is the first vacation
l#ve ever had in my life...

775
01:03:16,807 --> 01:03:18,843
and who knows if l#II get a chance again.

776
01:03:19,087 --> 01:03:21,840
A few more days and l#II be back in Detroit...

777
01:03:22,647 --> 01:03:24,126
and all the fun#s over.

778
01:03:24,807 --> 01:03:26,638
Big chimneys, black smoke...

779
01:03:27,207 --> 01:03:30,005
hammering noise and work, and more work.

780
01:03:31,247 --> 01:03:34,364
Yet I couldn#t live without it.
I love it and I hate it.

781
01:03:34,887 --> 01:03:36,286
You know, Mr. Bradley...

782
01:03:37,207 --> 01:03:39,767
the Spanish moon is very becoming to you.

783
01:03:40,887 --> 01:03:43,196
I never saw you in this light before.

784
01:03:45,687 --> 01:03:48,076
- You weren#t even listening.
- Oh, yes, I was.

785
01:03:48,487 --> 01:03:52,036
I heard everything you said,
about yourself...

786
01:03:52,447 --> 01:03:56,679
Detroit, your work,
you love it and you hate it.

787
01:03:58,247 --> 01:04:00,124
Isn#t that the way you feel about me?

788
01:04:00,847 --> 01:04:02,121
Not exactly. I...

789
01:04:02,487 --> 01:04:04,796
- I never said I love you.
- Liar.

790
01:04:04,887 --> 01:04:05,922
When?

791
01:04:06,527 --> 01:04:08,722
Maybe I dreamed when I was asleep.

792
01:04:09,527 --> 01:04:11,279
Yes, I must have dreamed.

793
01:04:11,687 --> 01:04:14,679
Because I heard your voice
saying you were crazy about me...

794
01:04:15,247 --> 01:04:16,805
and that you loved me.

795
01:04:18,247 --> 01:04:20,158
But l#m sure you didn#t mean it.

796
01:04:22,007 --> 01:04:24,646
- I mean everything I say.
- No, you don#t.

797
01:04:26,447 --> 01:04:29,245
##Madeleine, I love you.

798
01:04:30,887 --> 01:04:34,118
##When you wake up, l#m going to take you
in my arms and kiss you. ##

799
01:04:55,487 --> 01:04:58,365
Madeleine, so you weren#t asleep?

800
01:04:59,047 --> 01:05:00,036
Not quite.

801
01:05:00,727 --> 01:05:04,436
Why did you let me go through
all this torture? Why didn#t you tell me?

802
01:05:04,847 --> 01:05:06,838
I wasn#t sure if I liked you enough.

803
01:05:07,927 --> 01:05:08,916
And now?

804
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:12,440
I still don#t know.

805
01:05:25,207 --> 01:05:26,401
[Knocking at door]

806
01:05:36,487 --> 01:05:38,842
Madeleine? Madeleine?

807
01:05:39,647 --> 01:05:41,000
Yes, dear?

808
01:05:45,407 --> 01:05:49,036
I have a wire from Aunt Olga.
I have to leave immediately for Madrid.

809
01:05:51,687 --> 01:05:53,882
Say, wake up, Madeleine. This is important.

810
01:05:54,127 --> 01:05:56,595
A telegram from Aunt Olga. I have to leave.

811
01:05:57,287 --> 01:05:58,925
Say, what#s the matter with you?

812
01:05:59,527 --> 01:06:00,880
Where are the pearls?

813
01:06:01,007 --> 01:06:02,235
Pearls?

814
01:06:02,327 --> 01:06:04,636
The pearls, yes. Where are they?

815
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:13,962
Now look here.

816
01:06:14,047 --> 01:06:16,720
You#re not to leave
until I wire you. Understand?

817
01:06:16,807 --> 01:06:18,604
Yes, I understand.

818
01:06:18,687 --> 01:06:22,077
No, you don#t.
L#m going to take this Bradley with me.

819
01:06:27,207 --> 01:06:28,356
What?

820
01:06:28,447 --> 01:06:30,961
I say, l#m going to take this Bradley
to town with me.

821
01:06:31,047 --> 01:06:32,400
L#II get rid of him there.

822
01:06:44,207 --> 01:06:45,606
Mr. Bradley.

823
01:06:55,607 --> 01:06:58,167
Mr. Bradley. Mr. Bradley!

824
01:07:00,687 --> 01:07:02,166
Yes, darling.

825
01:07:05,247 --> 01:07:07,886
Wake up, please. L#m leaving for Madrid.

826
01:07:10,447 --> 01:07:11,482
Goodbye.

827
01:07:12,687 --> 01:07:14,279
Have a good trip.

828
01:07:16,287 --> 01:07:19,165
If you#d like to go with me,
l#II be very glad to have you.

829
01:07:21,047 --> 01:07:23,481
It#s a wonderful trip. You can see Spain.

830
01:07:25,287 --> 01:07:27,278
Always wanted to see Spain.

831
01:07:28,527 --> 01:07:33,317
- Ever since I was a little boy.
- Well, now#s your chance.

832
01:07:34,047 --> 01:07:37,005
But l#m not a little boy anymore.

833
01:07:50,087 --> 01:07:52,555
He won#t go. See if you can persuade him.

834
01:07:52,967 --> 01:07:55,959
- We don#t want him hanging around here.
- L#II talk to him.

835
01:08:06,567 --> 01:08:07,841
Tom.

836
01:08:10,607 --> 01:08:11,596
Tom!

837
01:08:13,447 --> 01:08:14,436
Tom.

838
01:08:20,327 --> 01:08:23,160
- Good morning, Mr. Bradley.
- Good morning, Countess.

839
01:08:24,167 --> 01:08:27,159
- I hear you don#t want to leave.
- Right. I don#t.

840
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:32,522
My uncle sent me here to persuade you
to leave. Can you be persuaded?

841
01:08:34,007 --> 01:08:35,042
No.

842
01:08:36,127 --> 01:08:37,560
Thank you, darling.

843
01:08:44,767 --> 01:08:47,918
- Well?
- Carlos, he thinks you#re a wonderful man.

844
01:08:48,007 --> 01:08:49,406
Well, is he going to leave?

845
01:08:49,807 --> 01:08:50,796
No.

846
01:09:02,167 --> 01:09:06,240
Now, Mr. Bradley, I don#t want
to be impolite, but I must insist.

847
01:09:27,287 --> 01:09:28,640
Madeleine.

848
01:09:29,207 --> 01:09:30,196
Yes, darling?

849
01:09:30,727 --> 01:09:32,957
Nothing. I was just saying your name.

850
01:09:34,087 --> 01:09:38,558
Madeleine. What a lovely name.
Much nicer than Countess.

851
01:09:39,367 --> 01:09:42,518
Please forget the Countess.
There is no Countess.

852
01:09:43,047 --> 01:09:44,275
Just Madeleine.

853
01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:46,362
And Tom.

854
01:09:52,887 --> 01:09:56,516
Madeleine, do you mind if I ask you
a very personal question?

855
01:09:58,407 --> 01:09:59,840
No, please, what is it?

856
01:10:00,167 --> 01:10:01,646
Are you eating those eggs?

857
01:10:04,167 --> 01:10:05,202
No.

858
01:10:06,807 --> 01:10:07,796
Thank you.

859
01:10:14,087 --> 01:10:16,885
You get a marvellous appetite in Spain.

860
01:10:16,967 --> 01:10:19,640
What a country! What eggs!

861
01:10:28,407 --> 01:10:29,476
What#s the matter?

862
01:10:30,807 --> 01:10:33,526
Nothing. Just looking at you.

863
01:10:34,967 --> 01:10:36,400
How do I look in the sunlight?

864
01:10:37,167 --> 01:10:39,317
Bad, very bad.

865
01:10:40,247 --> 01:10:42,044
As a matter of fact, so bad...

866
01:10:42,287 --> 01:10:44,642
that I wish
the moon would soon come out again.

867
01:10:52,967 --> 01:10:55,197
Do you realise
that you are now my prisoner?

868
01:10:55,727 --> 01:10:59,879
No car, no telephone,
hours to the nearest railroad...

869
01:11:00,727 --> 01:11:02,285
and a train only every two days.

870
01:11:02,367 --> 01:11:04,483
You frighten me and we#re alone.

871
01:11:05,167 --> 01:11:06,486
All by ourselves.

872
01:11:07,247 --> 01:11:09,807
Two days ago,
I didn#t know anything about you.

873
01:11:10,127 --> 01:11:12,118
Two days ago, you didn#t even exist.

874
01:11:12,487 --> 01:11:15,877
You#re wrong, I did exist, but I didn#t live.

875
01:11:17,927 --> 01:11:19,519
It#s crazy, isn#t it?

876
01:11:20,087 --> 01:11:21,076
But wonderful.

877
01:11:21,887 --> 01:11:24,640
A certain Mr. Bradley comes from America.

878
01:11:25,687 --> 01:11:27,166
That#s all I know about you.

879
01:11:27,847 --> 01:11:32,318
All I know about you is you stole my car...

880
01:11:33,647 --> 01:11:35,319
and l#m insane about you.

881
01:11:56,847 --> 01:11:57,836
Olga?

882
01:11:59,287 --> 01:12:01,118
Hello, Madeleine.

883
01:12:01,967 --> 01:12:04,197
Please. Why did you come here?

884
01:12:06,207 --> 01:12:09,165
That#s a fine way to greet a sweet old lady.

885
01:12:09,247 --> 01:12:10,885
I could be your grandmother.

886
01:12:10,967 --> 01:12:13,765
And if your grandmother came here,
what would you do?

887
01:12:13,847 --> 01:12:16,122
You would offer her a brandy, of course.

888
01:12:20,647 --> 01:12:22,126
- Straight?
- Please.

889
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:24,995
Brandy#s the only thing I am straight about.

890
01:12:27,127 --> 01:12:28,116
You know...

891
01:12:29,687 --> 01:12:31,757
I never drank until I went to gaol.

892
01:12:35,167 --> 01:12:36,156
Thanks.

893
01:12:42,527 --> 01:12:44,757
You know,
people wouldn#t be so afraid of dying...

894
01:12:44,847 --> 01:12:47,156
if they could take
a bottle of brandy with them.

895
01:12:47,247 --> 01:12:48,566
Did Carlos send you?

896
01:12:49,087 --> 01:12:51,237
Yes. And he#s pretty sore at you.

897
01:12:51,327 --> 01:12:52,316
I don#t care.

898
01:12:52,447 --> 01:12:54,722
Now come on,
you could have answered his wires...

899
01:12:54,807 --> 01:12:56,877
and they really need you in Madrid.

900
01:12:57,447 --> 01:12:59,165
L#ve some good news for you.

901
01:12:59,967 --> 01:13:02,401
We#ve a great chance
of selling the necklace.

902
01:13:03,047 --> 01:13:05,686
L#m afraid you have to find someone else.
L#m not going.

903
01:13:07,807 --> 01:13:08,796
Not going?

904
01:13:08,967 --> 01:13:11,606
No, l#m through with you, and Carlos,
and all the others.

905
01:13:15,047 --> 01:13:16,878
I need another brandy.

906
01:13:27,287 --> 01:13:29,676
There, now l#m sober again.

907
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:34,724
Carlos told me all about the American.
Is he still here?

908
01:13:34,807 --> 01:13:36,320
That#s none of your business.

909
01:13:36,407 --> 01:13:38,557
You#re quite right. It is none of my business.

910
01:13:38,647 --> 01:13:41,639
But it is my business
to see that you get right back to Madrid.

911
01:13:42,207 --> 01:13:45,483
Now, Madeleine,
you know Carlos as well as I do.

912
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:48,082
He has a very kind soul...

913
01:13:48,167 --> 01:13:52,001
but as his record shows,
there is a very mean streak in him...

914
01:13:52,087 --> 01:13:54,157
and he can be pretty nasty.

915
01:13:54,247 --> 01:13:55,646
Very nasty.

916
01:14:02,007 --> 01:14:05,204
Why didn#t you stay in the car?
You promised to let me handle her.

917
01:14:12,487 --> 01:14:16,605
Before I tell you what I plan to do with you
in case you refuse...

918
01:14:16,847 --> 01:14:20,635
allow me to compliment you.
You#re looking more beautiful than ever.

919
01:14:21,487 --> 01:14:24,604
- Love must be a wonderful thing.
- It is, Carlos.

920
01:14:24,767 --> 01:14:27,759
It gives you strength and courage,
something to fight for.

921
01:14:27,887 --> 01:14:29,923
I have something to fight for, too.

922
01:14:30,487 --> 01:14:32,557
You know these pearls, don#t you?

923
01:14:32,887 --> 01:14:36,163
They feel cold when you touch them,
but they#re not cold. They#re hot.

924
01:14:36,247 --> 01:14:38,158
They#re burning a hole in my pocket.

925
01:14:38,727 --> 01:14:41,195
And I have to get rid of them
as soon as possible.

926
01:14:42,007 --> 01:14:43,520
Now look here, Carlos.

927
01:14:43,607 --> 01:14:46,804
You helped me when I was in need,
and you were very decent about it.

928
01:14:47,127 --> 01:14:50,403
Then you asked me to get the pearls for you
and I did. Now we are even.

929
01:14:50,487 --> 01:14:52,478
Mathematics isn#t my strong point.

930
01:14:53,007 --> 01:14:56,761
I only know that I absolutely need you
to sell those pearls.

931
01:14:57,087 --> 01:14:58,759
Now go pack. We#re leaving.

932
01:14:58,847 --> 01:15:00,997
- Yes, but in different directions.
- Oh, no.

933
01:15:01,087 --> 01:15:02,679
No, in the same direction.

934
01:15:03,527 --> 01:15:07,076
Now, Madeleine, no matter how close
you may be to this American...

935
01:15:07,167 --> 01:15:09,556
don#t forget that you and I are closer still.

936
01:15:10,127 --> 01:15:12,925
We#re strung together
on the same rope of pearls.

937
01:15:14,367 --> 01:15:15,436
Countess.

938
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:20,122
It was very gracious of you to elevate me
to that lofty station...

939
01:15:21,167 --> 01:15:23,635
and I hope Your Highness
won#t be too insulted...

940
01:15:24,367 --> 01:15:29,043
but I have definitely made up my mind
to remove the crest from my stationery...

941
01:15:29,567 --> 01:15:32,035
my lingerie, and my life.

942
01:15:32,807 --> 01:15:34,126
- Goodbye.
- Oh, no.

943
01:15:34,207 --> 01:15:36,767
- Let me go.
- Why don#t you call for help?

944
01:15:37,247 --> 01:15:39,636
Why don#t you call for your friend?
Why don#t you?

945
01:15:39,967 --> 01:15:41,525
Why don#t you bring him here?

946
01:15:42,607 --> 01:15:43,960
Why don#t you tell him?

947
01:16:25,047 --> 01:16:28,596
It must be hard for you.
I know how you feel, Madeleine.

948
01:16:29,287 --> 01:16:31,039
It really is serious, isn#t it?

949
01:16:32,327 --> 01:16:34,158
For the first time in my life.

950
01:16:34,327 --> 01:16:38,525
He must be a nice young man.
Where is he? L#d like to meet him.

951
01:16:38,607 --> 01:16:39,756
Don#t you dare.

952
01:16:40,207 --> 01:16:44,678
Why? Are you afraid?
Why don#t you tell him about yourself?

953
01:16:45,127 --> 01:16:46,116
I will.

954
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:49,995
Oh, no. You think you will, but you won#t.

955
01:16:50,527 --> 01:16:52,518
The words won#t come from your tongue.

956
01:16:52,687 --> 01:16:55,759
I tried it once myself,
and it won#t do, my dear.

957
01:16:55,847 --> 01:16:59,840
Some years ago,
I was sick in a hospital in Vienna.

958
01:17:00,567 --> 01:17:03,923
There was a charming doctor.
He was a fine man.

959
01:17:04,767 --> 01:17:06,564
We thought a great deal of each other.

960
01:17:07,687 --> 01:17:10,804
I used to dream what you are dreaming now.

961
01:17:11,487 --> 01:17:15,321
Then, right in my dreams,
l#d feel a hand falling on my shoulder.

962
01:17:16,407 --> 01:17:20,844
Sooner or later it falls,
and l#d hear myself saying to him:

963
01:17:20,927 --> 01:17:24,681
##I must go downtown
on important business. L#II be back soon. ##

964
01:17:25,447 --> 01:17:29,042
And then under my breath l#d say, ##Soon.

965
01:17:30,527 --> 01:17:33,485
##10 years. 20 years.

966
01:17:34,927 --> 01:17:36,042
##Life. ##

967
01:17:38,847 --> 01:17:40,838
I still dream of him now and then.

968
01:17:42,607 --> 01:17:44,040
I still have it.

969
01:17:46,287 --> 01:17:49,324
- I didn#t spoil it.
- Stop it!

970
01:17:50,847 --> 01:17:52,439
What are you going to tell him?

971
01:17:55,727 --> 01:17:59,515
I don#t know. L#II think of something.

972
01:18:04,767 --> 01:18:07,235
[Singing] We are sailing, we are sailing

973
01:18:07,327 --> 01:18:10,205
We are sailing the 28th

974
01:18:10,447 --> 01:18:12,483
The 28th we

975
01:18:17,367 --> 01:18:19,927
We are sailing, we are sailing

976
01:18:20,007 --> 01:18:22,760
We are sailing the 27th

977
01:18:23,127 --> 01:18:25,800
The 27th we're sailing

978
01:18:32,287 --> 01:18:35,199
Tom, I just had a message from Madrid.

979
01:18:36,007 --> 01:18:38,043
Well, that#s nothing.
I just got an answer from Paris.

980
01:18:38,127 --> 01:18:39,276
Everything#s okay.

981
01:18:49,207 --> 01:18:50,196
[Singing]

982
01:18:51,247 --> 01:18:54,205
Oh, darling,
in a few days you#II be in Detroit.

983
01:18:54,287 --> 01:18:57,245
Now l#ve warned you.
Don#t want you to be disappointed later.

984
01:18:57,727 --> 01:18:59,285
There#s no glamour about me.

985
01:18:59,367 --> 01:19:03,360
L#m not a king, nor a prince, nor a count.
Not even an Elk.

986
01:19:06,807 --> 01:19:09,958
- Tom, I have something to tell you.
- I must tell you something.

987
01:19:12,207 --> 01:19:14,437
I have a confession to make, Madeleine.

988
01:19:14,847 --> 01:19:18,396
I lied to you, and I think you should know it
before we get married.

989
01:19:19,847 --> 01:19:24,159
I told you I make a $150 a week,
and I only make a $125.

990
01:19:24,247 --> 01:19:26,477
- But, Tom, all this is not important.
- No.

991
01:19:26,567 --> 01:19:29,161
I have something even more embarrassing
to tell you.

992
01:19:29,567 --> 01:19:31,683
You#II find out
when you get to Detroit anyway.

993
01:19:33,167 --> 01:19:36,876
L#m not the general manager.
L#m only the third assistant.

994
01:19:37,247 --> 01:19:41,399
And my father#s not the postmaster.
He#s only a mailman, so...

995
01:19:42,487 --> 01:19:46,366
You see, Madeleine, you better think it over.

996
01:19:47,687 --> 01:19:48,722
What do you say?

997
01:19:50,127 --> 01:19:51,116
Well...

998
01:19:52,527 --> 01:19:56,805
what would you say if I lied to you?
If you found out l#m not a countess?

999
01:19:56,887 --> 01:20:00,402
Listen, l#d marry you
if you were a princess or a queen.

1000
01:20:01,007 --> 01:20:04,158
L#m not a snob.
But you are a countess, aren#t you?

1001
01:20:04,247 --> 01:20:07,205
- That doesn#t mean anything.
- It means more than you think, Tom.

1002
01:20:07,607 --> 01:20:09,199
L#ve been thinking about it a lot.

1003
01:20:10,287 --> 01:20:13,996
Castles in Spain are very beautiful,
but they don#t last.

1004
01:20:14,487 --> 01:20:17,559
They blow away and then comes reality.

1005
01:20:18,047 --> 01:20:21,323
Reality? We love each other, that#s reality.

1006
01:20:22,447 --> 01:20:25,245
No. It#s a dream.

1007
01:20:26,567 --> 01:20:28,364
We come from different worlds.

1008
01:20:28,447 --> 01:20:32,201
There#s a wall, a high wall between us.
There#s no use fooling ourselves.

1009
01:20:33,407 --> 01:20:37,082
I just had a message from Madrid
that brought me down to earth.

1010
01:20:38,087 --> 01:20:39,236
I see.

1011
01:20:39,847 --> 01:20:41,439
But let#s be grateful.

1012
01:20:41,687 --> 01:20:44,645
We had a gorgeous week together,
seven heavenly days.

1013
01:20:45,207 --> 01:20:48,324
Seven dreams, a beautiful adventure.

1014
01:20:49,927 --> 01:20:51,246
Adventure?

1015
01:20:52,887 --> 01:20:54,036
I see.

1016
01:20:54,967 --> 01:20:56,878
Turn on the moon, turn off the moon.

1017
01:21:00,727 --> 01:21:02,240
Don#t leave me like this, Tom.

1018
01:21:02,327 --> 01:21:05,603
These are our last moments together,
the way we#II always remember each other.

1019
01:21:05,687 --> 01:21:08,360
That#s all right.
I told you to think it over and you did.

1020
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:10,915
I can#t blame you. You#re right.

1021
01:21:11,007 --> 01:21:13,362
I can#t buy you any diamond clips
or pearl necklaces.

1022
01:21:16,607 --> 01:21:20,919
Pearl necklace!
It is a pearl necklace that is separating us.

1023
01:21:23,687 --> 01:21:27,236
Well, it#s too bad,
but I couldn#t buy you any real pearls.

1024
01:21:27,687 --> 01:21:31,885
And when it comes to jewellery,
l#m sure you like the real thing.

1025
01:21:32,687 --> 01:21:34,643
Tom, I swore I wouldn#t tell you...

1026
01:21:34,727 --> 01:21:38,083
but I can#t let you go away thinking
l#m something even worse than I am.

1027
01:21:38,607 --> 01:21:41,997
You heard about the big theft in Paris,
the pearl necklace.

1028
01:21:42,687 --> 01:21:43,676
I did it.

1029
01:21:44,167 --> 01:21:48,445
I fooled you, I lied to you. There#s only
one true thing you know about me.

1030
01:21:49,167 --> 01:21:52,682
I did love you. I do love you.

1031
01:21:55,727 --> 01:21:56,716
Goodbye, Tom.

1032
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:13,997
I hope she#s got rid of him by now.

1033
01:22:24,687 --> 01:22:27,599
You know, I almost left
without saying goodbye, Your Highness.

1034
01:22:27,687 --> 01:22:31,202
I wouldn#t like it known in European courts
that Americans have no manners.

1035
01:22:31,447 --> 01:22:32,516
Goodbye.

1036
01:22:32,967 --> 01:22:35,117
L#ve invited Mr. Bradley to stay for dinner.

1037
01:22:38,367 --> 01:22:42,485
I really think it#s an imposition,
but since you insist, well, l#II stay...

1038
01:22:42,567 --> 01:22:44,398
and try to be very entertaining.

1039
01:22:44,487 --> 01:22:46,603
L#m a little bit worried, Mr. Bradley.

1040
01:22:46,927 --> 01:22:50,078
If you stay to dinner,
l#m afraid you#II miss your train.

1041
01:22:50,167 --> 01:22:52,761
That#s the kind of hospitality I like.
Shall we join the ladies?

1042
01:22:52,847 --> 01:22:54,678
Mr. Bradley, the truth is...

1043
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:56,559
Now l#m sure you#II understand...

1044
01:22:57,127 --> 01:23:00,199
but we have some very serious
family business to discuss.

1045
01:23:00,287 --> 01:23:03,404
That#s all right,
just consider me one of the family.

1046
01:23:03,527 --> 01:23:05,563
After you, Uncle Carlos.

1047
01:23:12,407 --> 01:23:16,798
You know, this is sort of a farewell dinner,
and I think we ought to have a toast.

1048
01:23:18,967 --> 01:23:20,480
Just what would you suggest?

1049
01:23:22,367 --> 01:23:24,119
First, I want to drink to my hostess...

1050
01:23:24,207 --> 01:23:26,767
who first stole my car
and then stole my heart.

1051
01:23:27,967 --> 01:23:30,003
My car was insured, but my heart wasn#t.

1052
01:23:34,247 --> 01:23:36,602
And then I think
we ought to drink to Aunt Olga.

1053
01:23:36,807 --> 01:23:38,240
Because I understand she#s been ill.

1054
01:23:38,767 --> 01:23:39,756
I?

1055
01:23:40,207 --> 01:23:44,837
Yes, I heard you were very ill,
about 35 years ago in Vienna.

1056
01:23:46,927 --> 01:23:50,317
You made a mistake, Aunt Olga.
You should have told that doctor.

1057
01:23:50,407 --> 01:23:53,604
And if he had really loved you,
he would have helped you over that wall.

1058
01:23:57,447 --> 01:24:00,564
L#m sure it would have been a great shock
to him when he heard about it.

1059
01:24:00,647 --> 01:24:02,797
He probably would have called you
every name under the sun.

1060
01:24:02,887 --> 01:24:04,605
He probably would have taken you
over his knee...

1061
01:24:04,687 --> 01:24:06,484
and given you the spanking of your life.

1062
01:24:06,687 --> 01:24:09,520
- Does it still hurt, darling?
- Just a little. Don#t worry.

1063
01:24:10,567 --> 01:24:13,684
He would have slapped your hands
so hard that they#d never dream again...

1064
01:24:13,767 --> 01:24:15,678
of touching anything
that didn#t belong to them.

1065
01:24:16,447 --> 01:24:19,041
L#m sorry, honey. They#re still a little red.

1066
01:24:21,327 --> 01:24:23,921
But he#d have stuck by you
if he really loved you.

1067
01:24:24,007 --> 01:24:25,918
He would have seen
that you got your chance.

1068
01:24:26,767 --> 01:24:31,477
And if anybody tries to stop you
from getting that chance, l#d like to see him!

1069
01:24:37,087 --> 01:24:41,046
How about some sauce hollandaise?
It goes very well with a fricassee of chicken.

1070
01:24:45,927 --> 01:24:47,758
Tell me, Your Highness...

1071
01:24:47,847 --> 01:24:51,283
you#re a man of great experience,
you usually know what#s coming next.

1072
01:24:51,887 --> 01:24:53,798
Do you think there#s going to be a war?

1073
01:24:54,487 --> 01:24:57,559
I hope not. L#m always in favour of peace.

1074
01:24:58,887 --> 01:25:03,642
But as the situation is at the moment,
with nobody minding his own business...

1075
01:25:04,207 --> 01:25:06,277
you never can tell what may happen.

1076
01:25:06,807 --> 01:25:08,160
Tell me, Tom...

1077
01:25:08,247 --> 01:25:11,444
what would America#s attitude be
if it really came to a crisis?

1078
01:25:12,287 --> 01:25:15,563
If America is wise,
it won#t ever mix in European affairs.

1079
01:25:16,487 --> 01:25:21,038
But sometimes we get dragged in, and then,
of course, we have to go through with it.

1080
01:25:21,767 --> 01:25:24,918
You can#t underestimate America.
That would be a foolish thing to do.

1081
01:25:25,807 --> 01:25:27,126
It#s a big country.

1082
01:25:28,847 --> 01:25:30,519
Six feet three.

1083
01:25:41,167 --> 01:25:43,158
How about some more sauce hollandaise?

1084
01:25:47,887 --> 01:25:49,400
You know, Your Highness...

1085
01:25:49,487 --> 01:25:52,445
I was just thinking of some parlour tricks
you once showed me.

1086
01:25:52,527 --> 01:25:53,926
They were awfully good...

1087
01:25:54,127 --> 01:25:57,517
but I think I can show you one
that#II top anything you#ve ever seen.

1088
01:26:03,967 --> 01:26:07,164
You see this chicken? Now watch closely.

1089
01:26:08,767 --> 01:26:12,316
One, two, three, presto.

1090
01:26:20,727 --> 01:26:24,925
It#s gone. Where is it? In my stomach?

1091
01:26:27,407 --> 01:26:29,716
That#s what you think. It isn#t.

1092
01:26:31,087 --> 01:26:34,636
It#s in the inside pocket of your coat
and it isn#t chicken anymore.

1093
01:26:34,727 --> 01:26:36,445
It#s changed into a string of pearls.

1094
01:26:37,807 --> 01:26:41,277
You know, that#s marvellous.
I can scarcely believe it.

1095
01:26:44,087 --> 01:26:47,045
But you#re right. It is in my inside pocket.

1096
01:26:48,047 --> 01:26:52,723
But it didn#t change into a string of pearls,
it changed into this.

1097
01:26:55,607 --> 01:27:00,397
You see, Mr. Bradley,
it#s a better trick than even you thought.

1098
01:27:00,487 --> 01:27:02,762
- Carlos.
- Don#t worry, darling.

1099
01:27:02,847 --> 01:27:05,361
He won#t shoot me.
There are too many witnesses around.

1100
01:27:05,767 --> 01:27:08,076
Besides, hanging is a very painful death.

1101
01:27:08,447 --> 01:27:11,837
I really hope you don#t shoot him
unless it#s absolutely necessary.

1102
01:27:13,887 --> 01:27:17,675
Now, Mr. Bradley, l#m going to lock you
in a nice, cool cellar for two or three days...

1103
01:27:17,767 --> 01:27:21,555
where you#II have a chance to think
about life and Bronson 8.

1104
01:27:22,127 --> 01:27:25,358
In other words, l#m giving you back
to the automobile business.

1105
01:27:29,967 --> 01:27:31,195
Pedro!

1106
01:27:35,487 --> 01:27:36,476
Yes, sir.

1107
01:27:37,047 --> 01:27:39,641
Take the plate to the kitchen
and disarm the fricassee.

1108
01:27:41,247 --> 01:27:43,886
Now, Mr. Whatever-your-name-is,
I want that pearl necklace.

1109
01:27:43,967 --> 01:27:45,082
Well, you won#t get it.

1110
01:27:45,167 --> 01:27:47,601
All right,
l#II go into my final trick of the evening.

1111
01:27:47,687 --> 01:27:50,042
See this hand? Now it#s a fist.

1112
01:27:50,567 --> 01:27:52,717
The fist is still in my hand
and when I count three...

1113
01:27:52,807 --> 01:27:54,525
the fist will be on your jaw.

1114
01:27:54,607 --> 01:27:56,359
One, two...

1115
01:28:03,727 --> 01:28:05,763
[Crashing]

1116
01:28:09,327 --> 01:28:11,079
A lady to see you, M. Duvalle.

1117
01:28:11,207 --> 01:28:12,720
Will you excuse me, please?

1118
01:28:16,487 --> 01:28:18,682
Yes, madame, what can l...

1119
01:28:19,567 --> 01:28:21,239
How do you do, M. Duvalle?

1120
01:28:21,607 --> 01:28:23,723
May I introduce my fiancé, Mr. Bradley?

1121
01:28:24,207 --> 01:28:26,004
Glad to meet you, M. Duvalle.

1122
01:28:26,087 --> 01:28:29,204
L#ve heard so much about you,
it#s just like meeting an old friend.

1123
01:28:29,287 --> 01:28:31,403
We came to see you
about the pearl necklace.

1124
01:28:31,687 --> 01:28:34,724
Pearl necklace?
Do you intend to buy another one?

1125
01:28:34,927 --> 01:28:36,155
On the contrary.

1126
01:28:36,247 --> 01:28:40,206
You see, the necklace that you sold
mademoiselle is really very beautiful...

1127
01:28:40,287 --> 01:28:43,438
but too expensive for us,
and l#m afraid we#II have to return it.

1128
01:28:43,527 --> 01:28:45,597
- You have it with you, dear?
- Yes, darling.

1129
01:28:48,647 --> 01:28:51,684
Would it upset you too much
if I would ask you to take it back?

1130
01:28:51,767 --> 01:28:53,997
I hate to return things, it#s not my habit.

1131
01:28:54,087 --> 01:28:57,124
But you said you would take it back
whenever I changed my mind...

1132
01:28:57,327 --> 01:28:59,079
and I have changed my mind.

1133
01:28:59,647 --> 01:29:01,922
As a matter of fact, l#ve changed my life.

1134
01:29:02,607 --> 01:29:04,484
L#m marrying Mr. Bradley soon.

1135
01:29:05,927 --> 01:29:07,326
That is, I hope so.

1136
01:29:07,567 --> 01:29:10,320
I know my fiancée is indebted to you
and even to France...

1137
01:29:10,407 --> 01:29:13,240
and if you can see your way to help us...

1138
01:29:14,447 --> 01:29:18,884
to release mademoiselle from her obligation,
it#II be swell.

1139
01:29:19,847 --> 01:29:23,886
Otherwise, l#m afraid we#II have to postpone
our marriage a long while.

1140
01:29:23,967 --> 01:29:27,118
Seven years. Seven long years, M. Duvalle.

1141
01:29:27,207 --> 01:29:29,482
Dr. Pauquet on the telephone, M. Duvalle.

1142
01:29:31,487 --> 01:29:32,761
Hello, Dr. Pauquet?

1143
01:29:32,847 --> 01:29:34,041
M. Duvalle?

1144
01:29:35,247 --> 01:29:37,078
I had a pretty bad night...

1145
01:29:37,527 --> 01:29:40,439
but suddenly I feel like a new man.

1146
01:29:41,247 --> 01:29:44,956
In fact, I feel like 2,200,000 francs.

1147
01:29:45,887 --> 01:29:48,321
That#s bad, definitely bad!

1148
01:29:48,807 --> 01:29:51,002
No, no, there#s nothing the matter with me.

1149
01:29:51,087 --> 01:29:53,726
L#II be around this afternoon
and tell you all about it.

1150
01:29:56,087 --> 01:29:57,725
Now, about this necklace.

1151
01:29:58,887 --> 01:30:01,037
- I will take it back.
- Thank you.

1152
01:30:01,127 --> 01:30:02,242
A thousand thanks, monsieur.

1153
01:30:02,327 --> 01:30:04,636
And be assured, M. Duvalle,
that when l#m in America...

1154
01:30:04,727 --> 01:30:06,080
l#II recommend you to all my friends.

1155
01:30:08,207 --> 01:30:09,242
Please don#t.

1156
01:30:09,847 --> 01:30:11,519
But to return to your obligation...

1157
01:30:11,607 --> 01:30:14,280
as far as I am concerned,
it is paid for and forgotten.

1158
01:30:14,367 --> 01:30:15,482
Thank you.

1159
01:30:15,567 --> 01:30:19,560
But your debt to the state,
that is a different matter.

1160
01:30:20,247 --> 01:30:22,442
I will do everything I can to help you...

1161
01:30:23,287 --> 01:30:26,165
but the final decision
is entirely up to the authorities.

1162
01:30:33,567 --> 01:30:35,797
- Did you want to get married today?
- Yes, sir.

1163
01:30:36,367 --> 01:30:38,119
- Have you a licence?
- Sure.

1164
01:30:46,167 --> 01:30:47,566
That#s not your marriage licence.

1165
01:30:47,727 --> 01:30:49,240
Why, yes, it is. L...

1166
01:30:51,407 --> 01:30:52,840
It#s your parole.

1167
01:31:03,527 --> 01:31:05,438
- The witnesses are here?
- Yes, sir.

1168
01:31:05,807 --> 01:31:07,240
Gentlemen, if you please.

1169
01:31:08,305 --> 01:31:14,587
