00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,168
-You have something I want.
-Come on, Bob.

[YELLING]

619
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:01,607
CHERRY: The computer takes
the information from the database...

620
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:05,194
...and constructs an environment
which is projected in the headset.

621
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:08,363
When the user walks on the pad,
he or she...

622
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:13,285
...feels like they're walking through a
corridor with drawers of files on all sides.

623
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:15,788
The user can stop at any time,
open any file...

624
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:20,626
...and thumb through the data. The laser
scanners are for body representation.

625
00:40:20,794 --> 00:40:23,045
-That's amazing. Ha, ha.
CHERRY: It's cool, isn't it?

626
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:30,552
Where is everyone?

Don Cherry's demo-ing the Corridor.

628
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:35,808
The meeting was pushed to 8:30.

629
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:38,102
No, 7:30. It got pushed up.

630
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,645
-Nobody told you?
-No.

631
00:40:39,813 --> 00:40:44,233
CHERRY: If someone wants to log on with
a regular computer, what they'll see...

632
00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:49,822
...is a model of themselves with a photo
that's pulled up from the data file.

633
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:52,407
JOHN:
Oh, hey, I know you.

634
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:55,577
The photo bears some
resemblance to me, I admit.

635
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,413
A little inside joke here at the company.

636
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:00,916
We've also constructed virtual help.

637
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:03,335
Users always need on-line help.

638
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:05,420
We've created an angel to help you.

639
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:11,426

Angel, how do I open this drawer?

00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,270
FURILLO:
What's the angel saying?

644
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,272
CHERRY:
That's between him and his angel.

645
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:27,025
We don't see the Corridor
as a product in the marketplace now.

646
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:30,779
This is something that we worked
up to demonstrate the potential...

647
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:32,948
...of virtual reality technology.

648
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:36,827
This looks good. Ha-ha-ha.

649
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:39,621
Hold on. What's that?

650
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:42,457
I believe it's your financial records. Ha, ha.

651
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:46,044
-Turn that damn thing off.
-Ha, ha. Sorry.

654
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:56,138
So glad you could join us.

655
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:59,224
That was a sweet entrance, my friend.

656
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:04,146
Ferry hit an iceberg? You were supposed to
call me after your meeting with Meredith.

657
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:07,566
I called you from her office.
Left a message.

658
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:11,570
There was nothing on my machine.
Then you're late again.

659
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:14,698
Thank God Meredith
took over the discussion.

660
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:18,660
Hey, pal, I left a message
on your machine, all right?

661
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:20,329
Check it out.

662
00:42:20,914 --> 00:42:22,581
Did you get my message?

663
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:26,418
You told Susan the meeting
had been moved to 8:30.

664
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:30,589
I said 7:30. If your wife can't take
a fucking message, get a machine.

665
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:32,216

-There you go, Mr. Sanders.
-Thank you.

00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:44,186
You're welcome.

-Full house today, huh?
-Yeah.

669
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:55,447
Meredith has been getting us
up to speed on the Arcamax.

670
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:58,242
Now that you're here,
we'd like your read on it.

671
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,535
Meredith told us, uh,
there's real problems.

672
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,288
You might have to go back
to the drawing board.

673
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:08,043
I'm sorry if I conveyed that
impression to Meredith.

674
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:11,046
I am convinced
we can manufacture them.

675
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:13,465
How many of the drives
off the line meet specs?

676
00:43:14,384 --> 00:43:16,385
I don't have that information with me.

677
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:19,096
JOHN: Meredith told us
the line is running at 29 percent.

678
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:21,098
Is that approximately right?

679
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:23,892
-Yes.
JOHN: The seek times are off-specs.

680
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:27,062
There's a power flicker in the screen?

681
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,231
-Right?
-That's right.

682
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:32,776
JOHN: With this merger coming up, don't
you think you should have told someone?

683
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:36,488
The merger isn't about a CD-ROM
that might be obsolete in a year.

684
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:38,490
It's about people.

685
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:42,411
FURILLO: It'll be obsolete in a year?
JOHN: The promise of the Arcamax...

686
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:45,205
...was a central factor in this merger.

687
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:48,542
I may be at fault. Tom said the
problem with the drives was serious.

688
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:51,295
-Not so serious.
-I didn't wanna cover anything up.

689
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,423
-I'm not covering anything up.
JOHN: Give us worst-case.

690
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:58,510
We go back to the drawing boards
and we're down for nine months.

691
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:01,847
Nine months? Meredith said six weeks.

692
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:07,185
Look, nobody likes to go back to
the board, but it can be an advantage.

693
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:09,187
Is there a problem?

694
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:12,357
This isn't an inquisition, Bob.
I feel like I'm pulling teeth.

695
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:16,820
John just wants to get a handle on
what the problems are with the lines.

696
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:21,700
-I don't know is the honest answer.
JOHN: Wait a minute.

697
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:24,786
You are the head of Manufacturing.

698
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:28,540
You are in charge of Arcamax.
There are problems with it...

699
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:33,086
...that could take nine months to fix,
which I assume means a year.

700
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:34,880
And the bottom line is...

701
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:37,799
...you don't know?

702
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,093
Goddamn it.

703
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,429
Goddamn it!

704
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:44,639
Jesus Christ!

705
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:50,812
-Tom.
-Just the man I wanted to see.

706
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,315
Phil, this is not
gonna work out with Meredith.

707
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:55,776
-Evidently not.
-She set me up.

708
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,779
-She set me up.
-I saw. Sit down.

709
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:02,657
-Why? What'd I do?
-Please, would you just sit?

710
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:08,330
Meredith told me
about your meeting last night.

711
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:09,915
What?

712
00:45:12,794 --> 00:45:14,169
What'd she tell you?

713
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:18,215
She wants to handle the intervention
internally, which is best.

714
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:21,593
-She still cares about you.
-Wait a minute.

715
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:23,720
What'd she say?

716
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:28,183
Not to put too fine a point on it,
she said you sexually harassed her.

717
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:31,561
I sexually harassed her?

718
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:35,065
-What would you call it?
-Phil, she jumped me in her office.

719
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:38,568
She jumped you? You're in denial.
That's typical.

720
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,362
She almost raped me.

721
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:43,365
You need help.
You have to accept responsibility for--

722
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:46,868
What do you call this?
What about that?

723
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:49,246
Looks like she was
forced to defend herself.

724
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:54,000
Defend herself? The woman can
kick the shit out of both of us!

725
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:57,003
-It may have seemed different to you.
-I didn't harass her.

726
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,713
She harassed me.

727
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:01,591
I've never even heard of a woman
harassing a man.

728
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,218
What are you doing here?

729
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:06,221
-I'm here as your friend.
-My ass, you're my friend.

730
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:11,226
When Garvin finds out about this, he's
gonna wanna throw you out on your ass.

731
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:13,520
I'm saying let's keep this quiet.

732
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:18,400
That's what Meredith wants too.
Resolve this quickly and quietly.

733
00:46:18,568 --> 00:46:20,360
Want your wife to find out?

734
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:22,529
We're gonna have to tell her
at some point.

735
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:26,491
They'll get the whole thing,
and it'll be on the front page of the paper!

736
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:29,369
I'm offering you a chance
to make a new life.

737
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:32,372
Keep your family out of this mess.
Keep your job.

738
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,334
Obviously, some kind of lateral move.

739
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:39,754
Lateral? When you say lateral,
you mean out of the division.

740
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,840
You can't stay here.

741
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,050
She's scared out of her wits.

742
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:49,848
I'm not leaving this division.
I've spent 10 years here. I built this place.

743
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:55,437
-Now, we got a spin-off going on--
-We're thinking, you know, Austin.

744
00:46:55,897 --> 00:46:57,230
Austin?

745
00:46:57,565 --> 00:47:01,860
BLACKBURN: I told him what she said.
He claimed it was the other way around.

746
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:04,696
He said she harassed him.

747
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:08,074
What? He denies it?

748
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,660
You know how it is.
The man always denies it.

749
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,204
Is he crazy?

750
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,372
I offered him a lateral move to Austin.

751
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:18,752
To Austin. That's like a duck making
a lateral move to "á l'orange."

752
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:20,921
Phil, he's too smart for that.

753
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:24,132
Let's hope he's smart enough
to see he has no options.

754
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,759
Take care of this.

755
00:47:25,927 --> 00:47:30,430
This is a goddamn bomb we're sitting on
that can blow everything sky-high.

756
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:35,435
Meredith is key to the merger.
I can't have her involved in a sex scandal.

757
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:39,231
And I won't say goodbye to $100 million.
You got that?

758
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:41,733
Yeah, I-- I get the picture, Bob.

759
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:38,391
Tenth floor.
Down the hall and make a right.

760
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,025
GEER: There were no witnesses?
-No.

761
00:49:47,193 --> 00:49:49,694
Her assistant left earlier in the evening.

762
00:49:49,862 --> 00:49:54,074
A cleaning lady was outside the office.
I don't know how much she heard.

763
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:57,410
-Did you report that to anyone?
-In the morning, yeah.

764
00:49:57,578 --> 00:49:59,704
What was the company's response?

765
00:49:59,872 --> 00:50:02,749
They believed her.
They suggested I transfer to Austin.

766
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:04,584
I heard they were selling Austin.

767
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:09,422
The point is, if I go to Austin,
I lose everything, all right?

768
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:12,759
My stock options,
everything that I worked for.

769
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:16,054
-Did you call anyone after the incident?
-No.

770
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:17,764
-Did you tell your wife?
-No.

771
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:20,266
-Oh, boy.
-Why not?

772
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:25,563
I didn't wanna upset her. I felt guilty putting
myself in the position in the first place.

773
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:28,608
How would you characterize
Miss Johnson physically?

774
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:33,071
She's very pretty.
She was Miss Teenage New Mexico.

775
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:34,614
So you were kissing.

776
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:38,785
Yes. And then she began to rub me.

777
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:40,745
Rub you where?

778
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:43,957
You know....

779
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:47,544
Your penis?

780
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:48,962
Yes.

781
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:51,089
And?

782
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:55,885
I don't feel comfortable talking about it.

783
00:50:56,887 --> 00:51:00,140
-Because I'm a woman?
-Because you act like it's a game.

784
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:03,643
-Mr. Sanders, why are you here?
-I want to know what my options are.

785
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:05,145
What your options are?

786
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:09,065
I wanna know whether I can sue her
for sexual harassment.

787
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:11,317
To do that, you have to convince a jury...

788
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:15,405
...you were alone with Miss Teenage
New Mexico and you said no.

789
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:19,993
Sexual harassment is not about sex.

790
00:51:20,745 --> 00:51:22,662
It is about power.

791
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:25,832
She has it, you don't.

792
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:29,419
If you sue, you'll never
get another job in computers.

793
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:34,507
If you don't, they'll bury you in Austin.
Sue, and it's news. Don't, it's gossip.

794
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:37,761
If you sue, no one will believe you.
If you don't, your wife won't.

795
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:42,348
They will make your life hell for the next
three years until this case goes to trial.

796
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:47,353
And for that privilege, it's gonna
cost you a minimum of $100,000.

797
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:53,109
Do you not think it's a game, Mr. Sanders?
It's a game to them.

798
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:55,570
How do you feel about losing?

799
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,624
BLACKBURN:
That's what Meredith wants.

800
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:11,544
To resolve it, quickly and quietly.

801
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:23,223
They said she's not
gonna press charges. Why?

802
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:27,227
She's accused me. Why stop there?
Why not press charges?

803
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:30,396
Meredith didn't press charges...

804
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:32,398
...because she couldn't.

805
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:35,068
DigiCom is planning a merger
with Conley-White.

806
00:52:35,236 --> 00:52:37,654
It is supposed to happen this Friday.

807
00:52:37,822 --> 00:52:41,491
They think that we are as conservative
as they are.

808
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:46,412
With a scandal, Conley going to bed with
Katie Couric, waking up with Jessica Hahn.

809
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,832
Garvin is out $100 million.

810
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:52,085
I think we might make a plaintiff
out of this guy yet.

811
00:52:52,253 --> 00:52:56,923
No, a potential plaintiff.
I don't have to sue. I just threaten to sue.

812
00:52:57,091 --> 00:53:00,760
That's a very dangerous game.
Are you willing to play it?

813
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:04,180
-Fuck them.
-Now you're talking my language.

814
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,015
For the next three days...

815
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:10,436
...this loose cannon is in a position
to put a lot of pressure on this company.

816
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:14,274
And they on you, Mr. Sanders.
They on you.

817
00:53:17,236 --> 00:53:20,405
Call security.
Throw him out on the sidewalk.

818
00:53:20,573 --> 00:53:24,576
Bob, we have to appear to be impartial.

819
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:27,495
Keep him in his job,
keep paying him, no hassles.

820
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:30,999
I made Tom Sanders.
Who the hell is he to sue me?

821
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:33,334
Sexual harassment, under Title Seven.

822
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:38,131
He'll file with the Human Rights
Commission if we don't fire Meredith.

823
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:42,176
If he files, it becomes public.
It'd blow the deal.

824
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:45,930
We realize that. So does he.
He's blackmailing us.

825
00:53:46,098 --> 00:53:48,266
This is America, goddamn it.

826
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:51,769
The legal system is supposed
to protect people like me.

827
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:53,605
It gets worse.

828
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:57,442
His lawyer is Catherine Alvarez.

829
00:53:57,610 --> 00:54:02,530
Great. She'd change her name to
"TV Listings" just to get it in the paper.

830
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:06,284
I'm trying to get them to mediate.
Keep it quiet.

831
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:09,037
Mediate?

832
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:12,123
I want you to cut his balls off.

833
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:14,792
Did he say mediate
or split the difference?

834
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,713
I'm just hoping he'll agree.
Alvarez will tell him not to.

835
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:21,549
He'll agree.
He doesn't want this out in the open.

836
00:54:21,717 --> 00:54:24,802
We pushed him too hard.
He has nothing to lose.

837
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:27,639
Really? He hasn't told his wife yet.

838
00:54:29,642 --> 00:54:30,892
How do you know?

839
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:35,104
I know Sanders, remember?
He likes his secrets.

840
00:54:42,905 --> 00:54:43,947
Excuse me.

841
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:46,157
-I'll be in diagnostics.
-Where were you?

842
00:54:46,325 --> 00:54:48,076
They're pulling the drives apart.

843
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:50,203
-John Levin called.
-Levin with Sematach?

844
00:54:50,371 --> 00:54:53,456
-He said it was important.
-Why didn't they come this morning?

845
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:56,250
Susan called to remind you
you had the benefit tonight.

846
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:59,170
-Call Susan and--
-She said don't think about canceling.

847
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:03,174
-The Lewyns paid a lot for the tickets.
-I'll be there at 7:30.

848
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:05,718
-Ask her to bring me a shirt and jacket.
-Sure. Tom.

849
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:07,845
-Yeah.
-Is everything all right?

850
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:11,516
Everything is fine, thank you for asking.

851
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,603
I'm gonna kill Arthur.

852
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:19,607
We gotta solve this before Friday,
and you get the drives an hour ago?

853
00:55:19,775 --> 00:55:21,734
LEWYN:
What is Arthur doing over there?

854
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:25,196
All he does anymore is pass
macadamia nuts to people.

855
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:28,574
Is he a manager or a flight attendant,
for chrissake?

856
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:31,411
-He's sending you nuts?
-What's slowing it down?

857
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:35,248
Over here.
Let me show you something.

858
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,709
Arthur was right.

859
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:40,920
There's a compatibility problem
with the controller chip.

860
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,380
Is it a bug?

861
00:55:42,548 --> 00:55:45,633
Don Cherry debugged Arcamax.
There are no bugs.

862
00:55:45,801 --> 00:55:47,552
-Fabrication problem?
-It could--

863
00:55:48,262 --> 00:55:49,804
-What are you doing?
-Huh?

864
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:53,433
This is a sophisticated piece
of electronics, not a pickup truck.

865
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:58,021
Don, how bad is it? We have 4,000
of these. I gotta junk all of them?

866
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:03,568
I told Arthur to send me 10 units in
heat-sealed plastic bags. It's a hunch I have.

867
00:56:03,736 --> 00:56:06,279
Do what you can.
I don't understand it.

868
00:56:06,447 --> 00:56:10,742
In prototypes, we got no problems.
We go to manufacturing, it falls apart.

869
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:14,454
Mr. Garvin wants to see you.
He said not to tell anyone.

870
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:18,082
Catherine Alvarez on 2.

871
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:20,585
Thanks. Could you close the door?

872
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:29,552
Hello.

873
00:56:34,266 --> 00:56:35,683
Hi. How are you?

874
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:40,688
They wanna mediate. We should agree.
I don't want this getting out either.

875
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:43,399
Mm-hm.

876
00:56:44,485 --> 00:56:50,031
Yeah.

877
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:59,082
If we get this all over in a week,
my wife doesn't have to know.

878
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:09,842
No, I do not wanna tell my wife.
I don't wanna upset her if I don't have to.

879
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:20,186
Yeah.

880
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:28,653
Wait a second.

881
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:46,379
Guess what.

882
00:57:47,256 --> 00:57:50,341
They locked me out of my computer
and cleaned out my files.

883
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,803
I guess it's starting.

884
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:00,935
Mark, come in.
Sure I'm not interrupting?

885
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:02,812
No, not at all, sir.

886
00:58:15,576 --> 00:58:17,076
Going down?

887
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:22,456
Aw, don't tell me you're scared of me.

888
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,216
I didn't want it to be this way.

889
00:58:32,384 --> 00:58:35,303
Oh, yeah, we could be fucking
in the elevator right now.

890
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:38,431
-I think of you as a friend.
-Oh, come off it!

891
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:39,891
You called Blackburn--

892
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:42,435
To beat you to the punch.
I knew you'd play that card.

893
00:58:42,603 --> 00:58:45,146
I wasn't playing a card.
You were the one that was supposed--

894
00:58:45,314 --> 00:58:46,647
[ALARM BUZZING]

895
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:50,067
Uh-oh. Alarm. Alarm. Alarm.

896
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:52,904
This isn't a game.

897
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:56,741
Come on. You'd have a great job,
the spin-off would make you a millionaire.

898
00:58:56,909 --> 00:58:59,327
We'd have a little fun.
It's not like breaking rocks.

899
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:01,287
You don't get it.

900
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:05,917
Poor Sanders. You have no idea
what you're up against.

901
00:59:06,418 --> 00:59:07,752
As usual.

902
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:11,005
By this time tomorrow
you'll wish you took that Austin job.

903
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:14,926
We'll see.

904
00:59:16,637 --> 00:59:20,348
SUSAN: I'm trying to figure out whether
to get a fat Barbie for Eliza.

905
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:22,225
ADELE:
Mattel makes a fat Barbie?

906
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:25,102
SUSAN: Yeah. They call her
the "Happy to Be Me Barbie."

907
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,605
ADELE: Does she come with the
"Happy to Be Divorced Ken"?

908
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:30,107
SUSAN:
Heh. I'm serious.

909
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,984
Which is more stigmatizing?

910
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:34,487
Yeah, Barbie's stigmatized.

911
00:59:34,655 --> 00:59:38,491
It's that whole male,
36-24-36 image of beauty.

912
00:59:38,659 --> 00:59:40,368
Women are oppressed.
It's just a fact.

913
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:42,286
Women are oppressed? Ah.

914
00:59:42,454 --> 00:59:47,333
Eighty percent of suicides are committed by
men. They're dropping from heart attacks.

915
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:50,253
-You're not as tough.
-Sorry. We're just fighting the wars.

916
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:52,171
You start the wars.

917
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:55,591
I'm sorry.
I don't have my own crisis hotline.

918
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:59,887
-You're taking this Meredith thing well.
-That doesn't have anything to do with it.

919
01:00:00,055 --> 01:00:02,932
What was today's rumor?
She was once a man?

920
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:05,810
-Just tell her.
-Tell her what?

921
01:00:05,978 --> 01:00:08,896
Tell her there's a lot of us
who have worked as hard as you...

922
01:00:09,064 --> 01:00:13,025
...and you're blowing this merger
for all of us because you fucked up.

923
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:16,153
What happened?

924
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:21,784
-Who got to you?
-It's not that simple, Tom.

925
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:26,414
The thought of losing millions happens
to get stuck right here in my throat.

926
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:30,710
This was my big shot, asshole.
It's not like I'm being scouted by the NBA.

927
01:00:30,961 --> 01:00:32,503
Mark, what happened?

928
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:37,216
Who knows? The old girlfriend,
the bottle of wine, the late meeting...

929
01:00:37,384 --> 01:00:39,677
-...fill in the blanks.
-Thanks, pal. Thanks.

930
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:41,470
You're like these women...

931
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:45,433
...who think they're going back
to the hotel room, drunk, to watch HBO.

932
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,435
Could you possibly be more lame?

933
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:50,396
For your information, Mark,
Tom told me everything.

934
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:53,190
Everything that happened.

935
01:00:53,734 --> 01:00:55,735
And I support him 100 percent.

936
01:00:56,153 --> 01:01:00,323
-That is so sweet, but I don't think--
-I don't think we should talk about it.

937
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:03,367
Can we just enjoy the evening?

938
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:18,257
TOM: Susan--
-Obviously, something happened.

939
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:19,967
-Did you have sex with her?
-No!

940
01:01:20,135 --> 01:01:23,012
-Think first. Because if you're lying--
-No, I said, no.

941
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:28,100
She kissed me, and she unzipped
my pants, and....

942
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:30,770
-And?
-And that was it. Nothing happened.

943
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:32,938
Nothing happened?
How did it get that far?

944
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:35,858
-You think I encouraged her?
-Her hand was in your pants?

945
01:01:36,026 --> 01:01:38,319
-Yeah, but nothing happened.
-How did that happen?

946
01:01:38,487 --> 01:01:40,780
Then she accuses me
of sexual harassment--

947
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:42,865
-She harassed you?
-You don't believe me?

948
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:44,533
-Mark doesn't believe you.
-Mark.

949
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:47,870
He's got, uh, stock options on the brain.
He's got fits of back-stabbing.

950
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:50,539
Everybody's sure you're having
an affair with Cindy.

951
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:54,001
-I'm not having an affair.
-How could you let this happen?

952
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:56,754
-Nothing happened.
-Something happened.

953
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:01,384
She's an old girlfriend of yours.

954
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:05,513
Like I'm surprised. That's as
exclusive a club as the white pages.

955
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:15,064
-I was gonna tell you.
-I can't believe everyone knows but me.

956
01:02:15,232 --> 01:02:19,193
-Nobody knows it.
-You're so naive. Of course they know.

957
01:02:20,821 --> 01:02:23,823
I'm old-fashioned.
I greet my subordinates with a handshake.

958
01:02:24,032 --> 01:02:26,867
-I'll take care of it.
-Jesus.

959
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:30,663
What does she look like?

960
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:33,040
She's attractive.

961
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:35,042
One to ten.

962
01:02:35,419 --> 01:02:36,544
Eight.

963
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:39,672
Nine.

964
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:43,676
What does the company say?

965
01:02:43,844 --> 01:02:47,096
They want me to transfer to Austin,
do some therapy.

966
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:49,640
Austin? I'm not moving there.

967
01:02:49,808 --> 01:02:52,184
-We're not moving to Austin.
-Texas?

968
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:54,645
TOM: Susan, I'm pressing charges.
SUSAN: For what?

969
01:02:54,813 --> 01:02:57,857
Sexual harassment.
We have a mediation tomorrow.

970
01:02:58,066 --> 01:03:00,067
When were you gonna tell me?

971
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:04,155
That's brilliant.
Show up without your wife, who's a lawyer.

972
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:05,364
I'll take care of it.

973
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:07,283
They'll try to destroy you.

974
01:03:07,451 --> 01:03:10,119
-It won't go that far.
-It'll take over our life.

975
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:14,790
Depositions and whispering and legal fees
for some damn personal vindication.

976
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:19,628
And all anyone remembers is that
you were involved in something sleazy.

977
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:22,715
-Do you have a lawyer?
-Catherine Alvarez.

978
01:03:22,883 --> 01:03:24,925
Great. When are we on Hard Copy?

979
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:27,261
But if it had happened to you--

980
01:03:27,429 --> 01:03:29,555
You know how many times
it's happened to me?

981
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:32,808
-You never said this ever happened--
-You're so narcissistic.

982
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:35,060
Nothing ever happens
until it happens to you.

983
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:38,814
-You should've said something.
-I do what women always do.

984
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:43,235
I deal with it. I do not make a federal case.
Now go in there tomorrow and work it out.

985
01:03:43,403 --> 01:03:46,030
Right. I should shut up and fuck her.
What the hell?

986
01:03:46,198 --> 01:03:48,032
Apologize and get your job back.

987
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:50,159
-Apologize?
WOMAN: Shh, shh!

988
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:52,328
The children are sleeping.

989
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:56,790
Wait, I got a better idea.
Why don't I just admit it?

990
01:03:56,958 --> 01:04:00,044
I'll be the evil white male
you're all complaining about.

991
01:04:00,212 --> 01:04:02,588
-Then I can fuck everybody.
-Tom, stop it.

992
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:05,382
Chau-Minh, come on down,
I wanna exercise my dominance!

993
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:07,676
-You're scaring her.
-I have an urge!

994
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:12,431
-The children!
-My children that I provide for and protect!

995
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:17,144
They can come between me and my wife,
move us, take my job...

996
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:19,355
...and take the house we have made!

997
01:04:19,523 --> 01:04:21,941
And I apologize to them, Susan?

998
01:04:22,943 --> 01:04:26,529
They call me a rapist and I apologize?
Come on. This is a joke.

999
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:32,034
Sexual harassment is about power.

1000
01:04:32,202 --> 01:04:35,412
When did I have the power?

1001
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:37,164
When?

1002
01:05:45,567 --> 01:05:47,776
MURPHY:
Good morning, I'm Judge Murphy.

1003
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:50,070
This is a mediation, not a court of law.

1004
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:55,159
Our proceedings will remain confidential.
Maintain a civil and courteous tone.

1005
01:05:55,327 --> 01:05:58,245
Our goal is to determine the nature
of the dispute...

1006
01:05:58,413 --> 01:06:01,081
...and how best to resolve it.

1007
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:04,752
The parties have agreed that
Mr. Sanders will speak first...

1008
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:07,338
...and be cross-examined by Mr. Heller.

1009
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:11,508
Ms. Johnson will speak next,
and be cross-examined by Ms. Alvarez.

1010
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:13,010
Any questions?

1011
01:06:13,428 --> 01:06:14,762
Good. Let's get started.

1012
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:18,599
TOM: I had my cellular phone with me,
so when she called Garvin...

1013
01:06:18,767 --> 01:06:23,270
...I called Mark Lewyn to give him
the upshot of our meeting.

1014
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:24,980
Then she approached you?

1015
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:28,859
Correct. She took the phone
from me and she kissed me.

1016
01:06:29,027 --> 01:06:30,444
Where?

1017
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:33,614
TOM:
She kissed me in my ear...

1018
01:06:33,782 --> 01:06:34,865
...on my neck...

1019
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:36,450
...on my mouth.

1020
01:06:36,868 --> 01:06:39,036
She put her tongue in my mouth.

1021
01:06:39,371 --> 01:06:41,705
ALVAREZ:
When you asked her to stop, did she?

1022
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:44,124
TOM:
No, no.

1023
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:46,377
She, uh, unzipped my pants...

1024
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:48,545
...and she massaged my penis.

1025
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:50,714
ALVAREZ: Were you aroused?
TOM: Yes.

1026
01:06:51,049 --> 01:06:52,675
Then she slid down...

1027
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:54,134
...and she...

1028
01:06:54,469 --> 01:06:56,220
...put my penis in her mouth.

1029
01:06:56,388 --> 01:06:57,971
ALVAREZ:
Did you climax?

1030
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:02,142
TOM: I grabbed her by the wrists.
I threw her on the ground.

1031
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:04,311
Then I wanted to get out of there.

1032
01:07:04,479 --> 01:07:06,772
At that point, what did Ms. Johnson do?

1033
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:08,565
She threatened me.

1034
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:10,818
She said, "You're dead."

1035
01:07:11,486 --> 01:07:15,114
And then, the next day,
Mr. Blackburn here told me that...

1036
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:20,035
...she said that I had
sexually harassed her.

1037
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:23,080
Mr. Heller?

1038
01:07:23,248 --> 01:07:26,333
HELLER: Sanders, would you like a break?
-No, I'm fine. Thank you.

1039
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:30,170
HELLER: You say the bottle of wine
was Ms. Johnson's idea?

1040
01:07:30,338 --> 01:07:31,422
Yes.

1041
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:35,426
But, uh, when you were living
with Ms. Johnson...

1042
01:07:35,677 --> 01:07:40,013
...didn't you discover wines together
on trips to the Napa Valley?

1043
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:42,683
-Yes.
-Romantic trips?

1044
01:07:43,727 --> 01:07:44,768
Yes.

1045
01:07:44,936 --> 01:07:47,730
But you weren't expecting
anything romantic in her office?

1046
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,064
No.

1047
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:52,526
Did you have a conversation
after lunch about how...

1048
01:07:52,777 --> 01:07:55,362
...seeing Meredith gave you a...

1049
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:56,947
...boner?

1050
01:07:58,241 --> 01:07:59,950
That wasn't me.
That was someone else.

1051
01:08:00,118 --> 01:08:03,120
-Isn't the term "boner" a slang for erection?
-Yes.

1052
01:08:03,538 --> 01:08:05,539
HELLER:
You had a conversation about...

1053
01:08:06,458 --> 01:08:08,709
...having an erection? A boner?

1054
01:08:09,127 --> 01:08:10,753
Yes, but I didn't say it.

1055
01:08:11,296 --> 01:08:13,088
But you laughed.

1056
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:16,133
-Yes.
-So you condone it.

1057
01:08:16,968 --> 01:08:18,635
It was harmless.

1058
01:08:18,887 --> 01:08:20,387
If it's harmless...

1059
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:22,973
...why are we sitting here today?

1060
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,809
Well, it was just, um...

1061
01:08:25,977 --> 01:08:27,561
...what guys talk about.

1062
01:08:27,729 --> 01:08:29,229
About their boss?

1063
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:31,148
No, not generally.

1064
01:08:31,316 --> 01:08:35,986
HELLER: Yet you expect us to believe that
after having a sexual conversation...

1065
01:08:36,154 --> 01:08:38,238
...that you didn't have sex on your mind?

1066
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:39,948
That's correct.

1067
01:08:40,241 --> 01:08:43,452
HELLER: How would you characterize your
relationship with Ms. Johnson...

1068
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,162
...in the good old days?

1069
01:08:45,497 --> 01:08:46,914
Highly sexual?

1070
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:48,999
I wouldn't know how to rate it.

1071
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:51,418
Every day?

1072
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:54,421
Sometimes twice a day.
Sex in public places.

1073
01:08:54,589 --> 01:08:56,965
Sodomy. Viewing of pornography.

1074
01:08:57,801 --> 01:09:00,469
Vibrators and other mechanical devices.

1075
01:09:01,805 --> 01:09:04,598
Sometimes we sat on the couch
and watched television.

1076
01:09:04,766 --> 01:09:10,270
But when you became reacquainted,
you no longer saw her as a sexual object?

1077
01:09:10,438 --> 01:09:12,981
-She was just your boss now?
-That's correct.

1078
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:17,194
And do you admit having an erection
during the course of your meeting?

1079
01:09:17,612 --> 01:09:21,990
She had her top open.
It was an involuntary reflex.

1080
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,492
Reflex?

1081
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:27,287
Do you think Ms. Johnson's
gynecologist gets an erection...

1082
01:09:27,455 --> 01:09:29,164
...when he examines her breast?

1083
01:09:29,332 --> 01:09:31,124
I think that's completely different.

1084
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:34,002
Do you admit putting
your erect penis in her mouth?

1085
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:37,673
-She did it.
-Oh, I forgot.

1086
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:40,092
You resisted.

1087
01:09:41,469 --> 01:09:46,139
Mr. Sanders, uh, during your
rather fantastic testimony...

1088
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:49,434
...there was one moment that rang true.

1089
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:53,772
You said, and I quote:
"I was angry.

1090
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:55,774
I felt I was being pushed around."

1091
01:09:55,942 --> 01:09:57,568
-Correct?
-Correct.

1092
01:09:57,735 --> 01:10:00,153
The truth is, you felt that way all day.

1093
01:10:00,488 --> 01:10:04,992
You'd been expecting a promotion,
and she got it. You got angry about it.

1094
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:06,994
I felt I deserved the job.

1095
01:10:07,161 --> 01:10:09,830
You took that anger up to her office.

1096
01:10:09,998 --> 01:10:11,832
You were gonna show her who's boss.

1097
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,125
That's not true.

1098
01:10:13,293 --> 01:10:17,921
Mr. Sanders, did you tell your wife about
your 7:00 meeting with Ms. Johnson?

1099
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:20,424
I told her I had a meeting
and I'd be home late.

1100
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:22,050
You expected to be late?

1101
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:26,722
No, but if I got home earlier,
my wife would be surprised, pleasantly.

1102
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:30,267
So you make it a rule to lie to your wife?

1103
01:10:30,435 --> 01:10:31,685
I didn't lie.

1104
01:10:31,853 --> 01:10:34,855
When you called your wife,
did you tell her that...

1105
01:10:35,023 --> 01:10:37,524
...Ms. Johnson was a
former lover of yours?

1106
01:10:37,692 --> 01:10:38,734
No.

1107
01:10:38,902 --> 01:10:41,570
When you got home,
did you tell her what happened?

1108
01:10:43,031 --> 01:10:45,240
No, I was hoping it would go away.

1109
01:10:45,408 --> 01:10:47,326
You hoped you'd get away with it?

1110
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:48,827
MURPHY:
Mr. Heller.

1111
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:53,415
Do not debunk the illusion that this
dispute might be settled amicably.

1112
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:57,753
That's okay. I have no further questions.

1113
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:05,719
MEREDITH: I asked to see family pictures.
I thought if we put it on that basis...

1114
01:11:05,887 --> 01:11:08,221
...it would be clear
things had changed between us.

1115
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:10,599
Mr. Sanders,
do you have those pictures now?

1116
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:12,935
I'd like to Xerox them for the file.

1117
01:11:13,227 --> 01:11:14,978
HELLER:
You can continue.

1118
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:20,233
He remarked his wife hadn't lost
all the weight gained from having children.

1119
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:22,361
I said his children were beautiful...

1120
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:24,571
...he said they made him feel old...

1121
01:11:24,739 --> 01:11:28,617
...and seeing me reminded him
of what it was like to be young...

1122
01:11:28,785 --> 01:11:31,119
...and that marriage
was a tough trade-off.

1123
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:32,704
Go on.

1124
01:11:33,581 --> 01:11:36,792
My assistant, Mrs. Ross, came in
and asked if she could go home.

1125
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,086
l wanted her to stay, but I felt guilty.

1126
01:11:39,253 --> 01:11:42,255
I'd been keeping her late for weeks
preparing for my new job.

1127
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:45,092
And, uh, where was Mr. Sanders
at that point?

1128
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:47,636
He began to rub my shoulders.

1129
01:11:49,931 --> 01:11:51,598
And you let him?

1130
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:53,558
Well, it was awkward...

1131
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:57,270
...but I thought we'd finish our discussion
and leave it at that.

1132
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:59,272
Is that when he tried to kiss you?

1133
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:03,110
No, I got a call from Mr. Garvin
and then I came back to Tom...

1134
01:12:03,277 --> 01:12:06,905
...and told him that was it,
and then he began to kiss me.

1135
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:08,365
Did you try to stop him?

1136
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:13,203
Yes. I struggled with him
and told him to stop. But he didn't.

1137
01:12:14,622 --> 01:12:16,832
Did he attack you physically?

1138
01:12:20,086 --> 01:12:21,128
Yes.

1139
01:12:21,796 --> 01:12:24,131
He grabbed me by my hair...

1140
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:28,135
...and, uh, forced me down on my knees.

1141
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:31,263
And, uh....

1142
01:12:32,807 --> 01:12:34,349
He put his...

1143
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:36,727
...penis in your mouth?

1144
01:12:40,148 --> 01:12:42,232
This is making me very uncomfortable.

1145
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,859
Would you like some water?

1146
01:12:50,324 --> 01:12:51,742
Here

1147
01:12:52,326 --> 01:12:53,744
Thank you.

1148
01:13:01,335 --> 01:13:04,171
He put his, uh, penis in my mouth...

1149
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:07,883
...and said that he was going to, uh....

1150
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:12,137
To "fuck you"? Were those his words?

1151
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:14,765
"Do you wanna get fucked?
Is that what you want?"

1152
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:17,768
And then he reached down
and tore off my panties.

1153
01:13:18,853 --> 01:13:21,021
HELLER:
What did you do then?

1154
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:25,567
He threw me down on the scaffold
and I kneed him in the groin.

1155
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:27,486
HELLER:
And that was the end of it?

1156
01:13:28,154 --> 01:13:32,908
It's strange. I'd think my instinct
would be to run, but I became angry.

1157
01:13:33,076 --> 01:13:36,745
I yelled at him. Called him names.
Told him I'd kill him.

1158
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:38,413
Just yelling.

1159
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:40,832
HELLER:
How did he react?

1160
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,670
He seemed to realize what he'd done.
He pulled up his pants and ran out.

1161
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:49,716
Did you call anyone afterwards?

1162
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:54,012
No. I didn't know what to do.

1163
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:58,183
I kept going over the day
in my mind, trying to figure out...

1164
01:13:58,351 --> 01:14:01,228
...if somehow this thing was my fault.

1165
01:14:03,523 --> 01:14:07,275
-You reported it the next morning?
-Yes.

1166
01:14:08,528 --> 01:14:11,738
But you didn't bring formal charges.
Why not?

1167
01:14:13,616 --> 01:14:15,367
I talked to Phil Blackburn.

1168
01:14:15,535 --> 01:14:17,619
I knew he was a friend of Tom's.

1169
01:14:17,787 --> 01:14:19,788
I didn't wanna destroy...

1170
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:23,959
...Tom's marriage or his career,
but it's clear we couldn't work together.

1171
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:26,294
I would be too frightened.

1172
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:28,713
I'm frightened just sitting here.

1173
01:14:33,594 --> 01:14:35,137
I have nothing further.

1174
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:36,847
MURPHY:
Ms. Alvarez.

1175
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:41,643
ALVAREZ: Ms. Johnson,
I just wanna be clear on one thing.

1176
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:45,480
Mr. Sanders suggested
the bottle of wine?

1177
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:47,816
-That's right.
ALVAREZ: But you bought it.

1178
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:50,735
I sent my assistant Mrs. Ross
out to buy a bottle.

1179
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:52,863
-That afternoon?
-Yes.

1180
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:54,823
Did you tell her what kind?

1181
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:59,077
I said to get a nice Chardonnay.
I remembered that Tom liked white wine.

1182
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:03,165
From those trips to Napa that he was
an amateur wine connoisseur.

1183
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:06,585
-He'd be impressed by a nice bottle?
-Yes.

1184
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:09,713
-Do you remember the wine?
-No.

1185
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:12,549
The '91 Pahlmeyer?

1186
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:14,759
Yes. That's right.

1187
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:17,679
Do you know where your
assistant got that wine?

1188
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:21,183
I assume she got it from
the liquor store down the street.

1189
01:15:21,434 --> 01:15:23,226
Would it surprise you to know...

1190
01:15:23,394 --> 01:15:26,688
...that there isn't a liquor store
in Seattle that carries that bottle?

1191
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:30,609
Mrs. Ross is very resourceful.

1192
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:32,277
Very resourceful?

1193
01:15:32,445 --> 01:15:36,281
A bottle of wine you can't find
within 500 miles of Seattle.

1194
01:15:38,034 --> 01:15:41,036
I have no idea where she
got the bottle of wine.

1195
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:46,124
Isn't it true, Ms. Johnson, that you told
Mrs. Ross three weeks ago...

1196
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:49,753
...that you wanted
a bottle of '91 Pahlmeyer...

1197
01:15:49,921 --> 01:15:51,630
...for your meeting with Mr. Sanders?

1198
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:55,300
-That's not true.
-And when she couldn't find it, you said....

1199
01:15:55,468 --> 01:15:59,971
Oh, oh, what was that?
It had such managerial brio.

1200
01:16:00,223 --> 01:16:01,973
Oh, here it is. Um....

1201
01:16:02,141 --> 01:16:04,726
"If you don't find the wine...

1202
01:16:04,894 --> 01:16:06,978
...find a replacement."

1203
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:09,814
MURPHY:
Do you have testimony from Mrs. Ross?

1204
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:11,608
ALVAREZ:
Yes, I do.

1205
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:14,527
MURPHY:
Ms. Johnson?

1206
01:16:14,695 --> 01:16:18,156
The fact is Mrs. Ross
has personal problems.

1207
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:20,158
She has a drinking problem.

1208
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:23,662
She tends to make up stories
to make herself seem more important.

1209
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:27,415
I told Mrs. Ross to go buy a bottle
of wine after Tom and I spoke...

1210
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:29,334
...at the luncheon.

1211
01:16:29,502 --> 01:16:31,920
For all I know,
she had that bottle at home.

1212
01:16:32,755 --> 01:16:34,589
Maybe in her wine cellar.

1213
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:38,885
Ms. Alvarez, any more questions?

1214
01:16:39,053 --> 01:16:40,762
Mm, no, not for now.

1215
01:16:43,266 --> 01:16:45,976
I think this is a good time for a break.

1216
01:16:46,352 --> 01:16:49,938
I just got some information on Meredith.
You won't believe it, or maybe you will.

1217
01:16:50,106 --> 01:16:51,356
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]

1218
01:16:51,524 --> 01:16:54,234
GEER: Alan gave me a list,
we can't verify any of this.

1219
01:16:54,402 --> 01:16:56,653
-You told me you didn't have sex.
-I didn't.

1220
01:16:56,821 --> 01:16:58,989
-What about--?
-I didn't have sex with her.

1221
01:16:59,156 --> 01:17:01,825
What is it, Tom?
She's trying to quit smoking?

1222
01:17:01,993 --> 01:17:04,202
-I'm telling the truth.
-How could you do this?

1223
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:05,996
She did it. That's the point.

1224
01:17:06,205 --> 01:17:07,831
You saw this woman alone.

1225
01:17:07,999 --> 01:17:12,294
You had wine, a back rub, you kissed.
And then this non-sex sex thing.

1226
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:14,963
You took off her panties.
Those are facts.

1227
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:16,214
So what? So what?

1228
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:20,260
-Those don't happen unless the man wants--
-I was cornered.

1229
01:17:20,428 --> 01:17:22,512
-You let it happen!
-I did not let it happen!

1230
01:17:22,722 --> 01:17:26,308
How could you? How could you
let that woman into our lives?

1231
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:28,727
-I did not!
-Get this.

1232
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:33,148
Ten of her subordinates have transferred
in the last five years. All men.

1233
01:17:33,316 --> 01:17:35,358
-How's that for a red flag?
-Can we get hold of them?

1234
01:17:35,526 --> 01:17:37,986
Yeah, but nobody's gonna talk
and we can't subpoena them...

1235
01:17:38,154 --> 01:17:40,488
-...because this is just a mediation.
-Aw, damn it.

1236
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:46,578
-Do you wanna have lunch?
-I gotta go back to the office.

1237
01:17:48,122 --> 01:17:50,790
ALVAREZ: How about you, Mrs. Sanders?
Are you hungry?

1238
01:17:52,251 --> 01:17:53,710
Yeah.

1239
01:17:54,754 --> 01:17:58,256
-How are you holding up?
-Are you married?

1240
01:17:58,424 --> 01:18:00,508
Chandler, Hogue and Alvarez.

1241
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:03,261
-I married Chandler.
-You married your boss?

1242
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:07,390
Classic case of sexual harassment. He
asked me out five times before I said yes.

1243
01:18:07,558 --> 01:18:11,644
Today, if I had said no once,
he would have been afraid to ask again.

1244
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:15,398
-Tom tells me you're a lawyer.
-Ten years.

1245
01:18:15,566 --> 01:18:19,903
-Wanna switch hats, tell me what you think?
-I don't look good in hats.

1246
01:18:20,071 --> 01:18:22,739
You're afraid she's telling the truth.

1247
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:25,200
Yes.

1248
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:28,370
What he did, he did out of weakness.

1249
01:18:28,579 --> 01:18:30,580
Hardly makes it better, does it?

1250
01:18:30,873 --> 01:18:34,876
I can't get in the middle
of your relationship with Tom...

1251
01:18:35,044 --> 01:18:39,089
...but the fact is she broke the law,
and that makes the difference.

1252
01:18:39,298 --> 01:18:44,302
Ms. Alvarez, 48 hours ago, my husband's
penis was in another woman's mouth.

1253
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:48,473
There's nothing in the law
that's gonna help me deal with that.

1254
01:18:53,312 --> 01:18:57,023
TOM: How long you had these?
CHERRY: Came in an hour ago.

1255
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:03,154
Garvin had me send the Corridor to the Four
Seasons for the Conley people to play with.

1256
01:19:03,322 --> 01:19:04,364
It's in the hotel?

1257
01:19:04,532 --> 01:19:07,826
Yeah. The Conley people
had such fun with it yesterday....

1258
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:10,745
Getting anywhere with the drives?
I'm counting on you.

1259
01:19:10,913 --> 01:19:13,123
-I have a hunch.
-What is it?

1260
01:19:13,332 --> 01:19:15,083
-I don't know.
-What is it?

1261
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:17,043
I don't know.

1262
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:21,256
She got to you, didn't she?

1263
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:27,345
What do you expect? They're stronger,
they're smarter and they don't fight fair.

1264
01:19:27,513 --> 01:19:30,432
It's the next step in human evolution.
Like the Amazons.

1265
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:33,143
Keep some of us for sperm
and kill the rest.

1266
01:19:33,352 --> 01:19:35,019
What do you have?

1267
01:19:36,272 --> 01:19:40,150
If I know something for a fact,
I won't withhold it.

1268
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:43,945
But I can't go out on a limb,
it's too intense around here.

1269
01:19:44,947 --> 01:19:49,701
I'm 23. I can't wake up tomorrow and
find I'm out of the computer business.

1270
01:19:58,169 --> 01:19:59,961
Why aren't you at the mediation?

1271
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:04,674
I just came back to, uh.... This was
the last thing I needed this week.

Come in.

The situation you're in,
something's come up.

I need to know exactly
what happened that night.

1275
01:20:14,393 --> 01:20:17,479
Well, it's exactly like I told Phil.

1276
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:19,981
You're not talking to Phil.

1277
01:20:21,108 --> 01:20:26,529
We got ahold of Sanders' phone records.
It's possible somebody overheard you two.

CINDY [OVER INTERCOM]:
John Levin called again.

01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:40,460
TOM:
Find out what it's about.

1280
01:20:40,628 --> 01:20:43,254
CINDY:
He said he had to talk to you personally.

1281
01:20:44,131 --> 01:20:46,174
I don't wanna talk to him now.

1282

Tom, could I talk to you?

1283
01:20:53,307 --> 01:20:54,432
Cindy...

1284
01:20:55,142 --> 01:20:56,851
...are you "a friend"?

1285
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:00,813
A friend?

1286
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,649
You know...

1287
01:21:03,108 --> 01:21:05,485
..."a friend." A friend.

1288
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:09,572
I depends on what you mean
by "a friend."

-Yeah, I gotta get back.
-I'll give you a lift.

1295
01:22:14,388 --> 01:22:17,056
Don't you think it's time we talked?

1296
01:22:25,399 --> 01:22:29,027
GARVIN: I understand you both had
a chance to get it off your chest.

1297
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:32,030
Your version of what happened.
Now I want it to stop.

1298
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:35,033
TOM:
What I got off my chest was not a version.

1299
01:22:35,326 --> 01:22:39,245
It's always somebody's version.
That's the legacy of the modern age.

1300
01:22:39,413 --> 01:22:43,750
We have information but no truth.
Flashes of electrons in a grain of sand.

1301
01:22:43,917 --> 01:22:45,543
I'm telling the truth.

1302
01:22:46,086 --> 01:22:49,756
-You gotta look at this from all sides.
-How many sides are there?

1303
01:22:50,591 --> 01:22:53,635
All right, let's say she made a mistake.
So what?

1304
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:56,054
She made a pass, that's all.
Put her hand on you.

1305
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:59,766
You could have decided it was flattering.
You could've taken it off.

1306
01:22:59,933 --> 01:23:03,811
You could have handled it many ways,
but this vindictiveness...

1307
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:07,774
-...I have to tell you, I'm surprised.
-It's against the law. I'm employed by her.

-I work for her.
-No. You work for me.

That's what I'm saying.

1310
01:23:13,364 --> 01:23:18,284
After all these years, why didn't you
come to me? Not go hire this lawyer.

1311
01:23:18,452 --> 01:23:19,786
Maybe I should have.

1312
01:23:19,953 --> 01:23:22,622
I mean, why can't you just forget it?

1313

Work together like adults and
everyone makes a pile of money.

-What's wrong with that?
-Things have gone too far.

Things can go back.

Why would he offer to settle now?

1317
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:37,428
He realized how much they got to lose.

1318
01:23:37,596 --> 01:23:39,597
No, he had us on the run.
It doesn't add up.

1319
01:23:39,765 --> 01:23:42,975
Maybe there's a vulnerability
we don't know about.

1320

I'm still getting messages from "a friend."
I printed out the address.

Maybe your investigators
can check it out.

Did Mr. Sanders ever touch you in a way
that makes you feel uncomfortable?

1329

I don't think he's aware of it.

Just answer the question, please.

-Yes.
-How does he touch you?

1332
01:25:07,811 --> 01:25:11,856
He'll pat me on my behind or
rub my shoulders while I'm at my desk.

Rub your shoulders?

I don't think he means anything by it.

You don't like it.

1336

I just feel it's inappropriate.

I'm not sure I see the relevance of this.

We're trying to establish
a pattern of behavior.

No.

You on Meredith's side?

I studied engineering for eight years.

I was the only woman in that department.
You know what I did?

You think I'm on Meredith's side?

Garvin told you. You get your job back.

-Oh, yeah.

I'm glad we got that one solved.

Shit, I have to call Lewyn.

problems with came in.

-Only you, Sanders.
-What?

the company, not solving their problems.

That's Mark's wife's voice on the machine,
but on Monday it was a man's voice.

1396
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:10,511
Then the next day, Mark said
he never got the message.

1397
01:29:16,476 --> 01:29:18,811
I dialed the wrong number that night.

1398

So?

That's why Garvin wants to deal.
He's got my phone records.

1402

I've got a 10-minute phone bill
the same time I'm in Meredith's office.

1403
01:29:41,084 --> 01:29:44,837

I called the wrong number...

it's a good thing I brought it home.

Thanks, pal.

Ms. Johnson, just so I'm clear
on what today's story is...

1447
01:32:55,779 --> 01:32:58,989
...would you define for me
"consensual sex"?

01:32:59,157 --> 01:33:02,201
Sex where both parties
are willing participants.

Mr. Sanders say "no" on that tape?

I don't know, I was too busy listening
to my underwear being torn off.

Thirty-one. Thirty-one times.

Doesn't no mean no?

1453

Sometimes "no" means that person
wants to be overwhelmed, dominated.

he didn't seem to have problems doing it.

That's when you got angry.

1460
01:33:37,570 --> 01:33:39,697
Of course I did. So would anyone.

1461

Don't we tell women
they can stop at any point?

no and meant yes?

The point is, he was willing.
That tape doesn't change anything.

1465
01:33:50,834 --> 01:33:55,629
The point is, you controlled the meeting.
You set the time, you ordered the wine.

1466

You locked the door.

You demanded service
and got angry when he didn't provide it.

So you decided to get even, to get
rid of him with this trumped-up charge.

1469
01:34:04,514 --> 01:34:08,434
Ms. Johnson, the only thing you have
proven is that a woman in power...

1470
01:34:08,601 --> 01:34:11,395
...can be every bit as abusive as a man.

1471

You wanna put me on trial?
Let's be honest about what it's for.

make a man's money...

Which brings us to our
Advanced Products Group.

1672
01:55:10,112 --> 01:55:12,780
Tom Sanders heads our
manufacturing department.

1673
01:55:12,948 --> 01:55:14,907
Tom, I wonder if you can come up here...

1674
01:55:15,075 --> 01:55:19,245
...and review for us the revolutionary
new product we call Arcamax?

1675
01:55:27,754 --> 01:55:29,797
Thank you, Meredith.

1676
01:55:31,842 --> 01:55:36,345
Arcamax is our own stand-alone
CD-ROM drive player.

1677
01:55:36,930 --> 01:55:40,725
Now, for a CD-ROM drive to be effective,
it has to be portable...

1678
01:55:40,892 --> 01:55:42,184
...it has to be fast.

1679
01:55:42,352 --> 01:55:48,024
Arcamax is twice as fast as any
CD-ROM drive in the world today.

1680
01:55:48,191 --> 01:55:51,277
In production, we've had our problems,
but we are solving them.

1681
01:55:51,445 --> 01:55:54,113
The problems,
are they design problems?

1682
01:55:54,281 --> 01:55:58,326
No, they were fabrication problems
involving the production line.

1683
01:55:58,493 --> 01:55:59,910
What sort of problems?

1684
01:56:00,579 --> 01:56:04,790
Well, for example, we should be using
automatic chip installers to lock...

1685
01:56:04,958 --> 01:56:06,959
...the control chip on the board.

1686
01:56:07,127 --> 01:56:09,629
The Malaysians have been
doing it by hand...

1687
01:56:09,796 --> 01:56:12,298
...literally jamming the chips
in with their thumbs.

1688
01:56:12,466 --> 01:56:14,967
And the quality of the air is dirty.

1689
01:56:15,135 --> 01:56:19,138
We should use level 7 air handlers,
we're using only level 5.

1690
01:56:19,306 --> 01:56:21,182
And, uh, we're ordering
our components...

1691
01:56:21,350 --> 01:56:26,354
...like hinge rods and clips,
not from our Singapore supplier...

1692
01:56:26,521 --> 01:56:30,858
...but from someone who's a lot cheaper,
but also less reliable.

1693
01:56:31,109 --> 01:56:35,571
I'm confused. You set up this line.
You didn't anticipate these problems?

1694
01:56:36,448 --> 01:56:40,785
The line was changed.
The specifications were altered.

1695
01:56:40,952 --> 01:56:44,538
How is that possible?
We know you to be a competent manager.

1696
01:56:46,375 --> 01:56:50,252
Well, you should know, Meredith.
You ordered the changes.

1697
01:56:51,129 --> 01:56:53,589
I don't know where you could've
got that idea.

1698
01:56:53,757 --> 01:56:56,258
Weren't you in Kuala Lumpur last year?

1699
01:56:58,053 --> 01:57:02,139
To settle a labor dispute.
I've never even seen the line.

1700
01:57:04,643 --> 01:57:07,853
-You've never seen the line?
-No, I don't know who told you such a--

[CROWD MUTTERING THEN LAUGHING]

1702
01:57:13,694 --> 01:57:16,362
You're watching Malaysian Channel 3.

1703
01:57:22,160 --> 01:57:24,829
Perhaps instead of digging up
Malaysian video clips...

1704
01:57:24,996 --> 01:57:27,498
...we should discuss
the problems in front of us...

1705
01:57:27,666 --> 01:57:30,751
...the problems in your department
with the line you set up.

1706
01:57:31,753 --> 01:57:33,379
All right.

1707
01:57:38,677 --> 01:57:43,347
The first memo in the file being handed
out is signed by Meredith Johnson.

1708
01:57:43,515 --> 01:57:47,518
It states that manual labor
will be used to install the chips.

1709
01:57:47,686 --> 01:57:50,396
That made the Malaysian
government happy.

1710
01:57:50,564 --> 01:57:54,150
It also meant voltage irregularities
and memory allocation--

1711
01:57:54,317 --> 01:57:57,445
That was a complex negotiation.
The Malay government insisted--

1712
01:57:57,612 --> 01:58:01,782
The Malaysian government
does not own shares of DigiCom.

1713
01:58:01,950 --> 01:58:03,826
These people here do.

1714
01:58:05,704 --> 01:58:07,371
The second memo...

1715
01:58:07,539 --> 01:58:11,584
...reduces the air handling capacity
in order to cut costs.

1716
01:58:11,752 --> 01:58:16,922
And that's why we're getting dirt in the
split optics, the drive arms, the chip joints.

1717
01:58:17,090 --> 01:58:22,219
The resulting delays will actually
increase the costs by more than 70%..

1718
01:58:22,387 --> 01:58:26,307
-The third memo regarding--
-The drives were your responsibility!

1719
01:58:27,142 --> 01:58:30,227
These problems were created
because of your incompetence, not mine.

1720
01:58:30,395 --> 01:58:32,188
That's the problem with this division!

1721
01:58:32,355 --> 01:58:34,440
-Passing the buck, back stabbing.

01:58:34,608 --> 01:58:35,649
I'm not through.

1723

This so-called evidence of yours
is fooling no one!

1724
01:58:38,737 --> 01:58:42,740
You can showboat and protect your turf
and think it means something.

1725
01:58:42,908 --> 01:58:46,243
You weren't told of these decisions,
because they're over your head.

1726
01:58:46,411 --> 01:58:48,954
This merger is about a synergy...

1727
01:58:49,122 --> 01:58:52,416
...between hardware and software,
between cash flow and capital needs.

1728
01:58:52,584 --> 01:58:56,587
-That's a language you can't understand!
CONLEY: I don't understand it either.

1729
01:58:57,297 --> 01:59:00,382
We were buying this company
because they could build things.

1730
01:59:01,092 --> 01:59:03,677
You understand what the heck
she's talking about?

1731
01:59:10,852 --> 01:59:14,605
I was trying to accurately convey
the sentiments of everyone here.

1732
01:59:14,773 --> 01:59:16,607
That's what I intended to do.

1733
01:59:21,196 --> 01:59:24,156
Meredith, could you step outside
for a moment?

1734
01:59:26,576 --> 01:59:27,618
[MOUTHS]
Bye-bye.

1735
01:59:35,794 --> 01:59:38,128
CONLEY:
Can you build the darn thing or not?

1736
01:59:39,047 --> 01:59:41,048
Yes, sir, we can.

1737
01:59:42,467 --> 01:59:47,263
Tom, they're replacing Meredith.
Garvin's announcing it in 10 minutes.

1738
01:59:50,141 --> 01:59:51,851
Ten minutes?

1739
02:00:15,417 --> 02:00:17,585
I'm surprised you didn't come to gloat.

1740
02:00:17,794 --> 02:00:22,590
Gloating is underrated. I actually
came here to pick up the Arcamax files.

1741
02:00:22,757 --> 02:00:26,510
-Very smart people underrated you.
-Thank you, Meredith.

1742
02:00:27,095 --> 02:00:28,762
Not including myself.

1743
02:00:28,930 --> 02:00:31,849
I beat you. I beat you fair and square.

1744
02:00:32,350 --> 02:00:34,268
Garvin lost his nerve.

1745
02:00:34,436 --> 02:00:37,813
It was his brilliant idea
to fire you for incompetence.

1746
02:00:37,981 --> 02:00:39,356
Him and Phil.

1747
02:00:39,524 --> 02:00:41,108
And I'm the one getting fired.

1748
02:00:42,110 --> 02:00:46,697
I've never seen you play the victim.
It's the only good quality you had.

1749
02:00:46,865 --> 02:00:51,493
I'm playing the game the way you guys
set it up, and I'm being punished for it.

1750
02:00:51,661 --> 02:00:53,329
It's fine.

1751
02:00:53,496 --> 02:00:57,374
I've had calls from 10 head-hunters
with job offers in the last hour.

1752
02:00:58,710 --> 02:01:02,338
Don't be surprised if I'm back
in 10 years to buy this place.

1753
02:01:04,382 --> 02:01:09,261
Did it ever occur to you, Meredith,
that maybe I set you up?

1754
02:01:24,527 --> 02:01:26,904
-Tom, this is my son, Spencer.
-How you doing?

The Chinese say:
"May you live in interesting times."

1761
02:01:57,936 --> 02:02:02,272
This merger is the most
interesting merger I've had...

1762
02:02:02,440 --> 02:02:04,233
...since my second marriage.

The merger is complete.

1765
02:02:08,405 --> 02:02:10,406
The question now is...

1766
02:02:11,032 --> 02:02:15,202
...who do we find to run things
up here in Seattle?

1767
02:02:15,412 --> 02:02:17,871
And what I realized during this...

1768
02:02:18,039 --> 02:02:20,332
...very interesting week...

1769
02:02:20,792 --> 02:02:24,128
...is that I have probably
focused too much on...

1770
02:02:24,295 --> 02:02:28,340
...breaking the glass ceiling,
on finding a woman to run things here...

02:02:28,508 --> 02:02:32,428
...when what I should have been
looking for is the best person...

...to run things up here.

1773

Someone whose...

1774
02:02:36,558 --> 02:02:41,145
...long service with this company
has established a record...

...and hands-on expertise.

And that person...

1779
02:02:51,072 --> 02:02:52,906
...is Stephanie Kaplan.

Yeah, I am.

I know a chemistry professor there,
Dr. Arthur Friend. A. Friend.
