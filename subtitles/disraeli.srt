00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,985
Are you Englishmen
or are you a lot of foreigners ?

3
00:00:46,415 --> 00:00:49,622
Are you free and independent citizens...

4
00:00:49,623 --> 00:00:52,287
or are you a flock of bloomin' sheeps ?

5
00:00:52,459 --> 00:00:55,877
Do you want England to be ruled by an outsider ?

6
00:00:55,878 --> 00:00:59,633
No. No, you says.

7
00:00:59,634 --> 00:01:05,487
Then who is this here Disraeli
that he should be Prime Minister of England ?

8
00:01:05,488 --> 00:01:12,394
A Jew whose grandfather
was an Italian. A bloomin' foreigner.

9
00:01:12,395 --> 00:01:16,697
Hear, hear !
What's he done for England, I ask ya ?

10
00:01:16,698 --> 00:01:18,860
What's he done ?
Nothing.

11
00:01:19,561 --> 00:01:28,489
Our friend here says nothing.
He must be blind, deaf and dumb...

12
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,484
... as well as intoxicated.

13
00:01:31,885 --> 00:01:38,360
And what does he say now ?
He says Russia is looking at us with eyes of yearning.

14
00:01:38,361 --> 00:01:44,281
That the Tsar has set up in his heart
to rule the seven seas.

15
00:01:44,282 --> 00:01:49,329
Bloomin' lot ! I says down with Disraeli.

16
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,924
Gladstone is the man for us.

17
00:02:03,815 --> 00:02:05,801
I consider it an affront...

18
00:02:05,802 --> 00:02:11,641
...to every English gentleman that the destinies
of our nation should be in the hands of a person like Disraeli.

19
00:02:11,642 --> 00:02:14,597
A man who poses as a great patriot...

20
00:02:14,598 --> 00:02:20,867
...but who is in reality an
unprincipled politician seeking only to gratify his mad lust for power.

21
00:02:21,868 --> 00:02:26,861
And now he wants
to involve us in serious international trouble...

22
00:02:26,862 --> 00:02:32,739
with this infernal nonsense about
Russia trying to undermine our power in India.

23
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,046
If the fellow keeps on he'll put England on the rocks.

24
00:02:36,047 --> 00:02:39,999
What does the Governor of the Bank of England say ?

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,045
I say he's a dreamer. A dangerous visionary
reaching out for Empire with greedy hands...

26
00:02:47,046 --> 00:02:53,207
...committing us to a foreign policy
of imperialism that makes me tremble for England's safety.

27
00:02:53,484 --> 00:02:59,076
But thank God for Gladstone.
He's more than a match for Disraeli.

28
00:03:05,255 --> 00:03:08,956
Foreign policy such as the right honorable gentleman proposes...

29
00:03:08,957 --> 00:03:14,396
...would not only gain us, and deservedly, the ill will of other nations...

30
00:03:14,397 --> 00:03:20,169
but would ultimately involve us in that great calamity: war !

31
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:26,031
I say that in proposing such a policy...

32
00:03:26,032 --> 00:03:30,934
... the right honorable gentleman has branded himself...

33
00:03:30,935 --> 00:03:34,448
... as unworthy to be the Counselor of England's sovereign.

34
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:38,388
Unworthy to be the guardian of England's welfare.

35
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:43,774
Unworthy to hold the high office of Prime Minister.

36
00:03:55,175 --> 00:04:01,596
And now that my honourable friend, Mr. Gladstone,
with his customary eloquence and tact,

37
00:04:01,597 --> 00:04:05,433
has expressed his customary disapproval...

38
00:04:06,334 --> 00:04:09,484
the issue, gentlemen, is this:

39
00:04:09,485 --> 00:04:13,735
Whether you are content to be a comfortable England...

40
00:04:13,737 --> 00:04:17,031
meeting in due course with a sad, inevitable fate...

41
00:04:17,032 --> 00:04:19,577
or whether you will be a great country...

42
00:04:19,578 --> 00:04:21,693
an imperial country...

43
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:24,326
a country where your sons, when they rise...

44
00:04:24,327 --> 00:04:26,600
will rise to paramount positions...

45
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:30,283
...and obtain not merely the esteem of their own countrymen...

46
00:04:30,284 --> 00:04:32,723
but the esteem of the world.

47
00:04:34,124 --> 00:04:39,310
Perhaps you think that
because no war clouds darken the present horizon...

48
00:04:39,311 --> 00:04:41,338
... that there is no danger.

49
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:47,220
Have you ever seen one of those
moving landscapes of the coast of South America ?

50
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:52,420
You behold a range of exhausted volcanoes.

51
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:57,810
Not a flame flickers on a single palid peak.

52
00:04:57,811 --> 00:04:59,754
But beneath...

53
00:04:59,755 --> 00:05:05,505
there is a dormant danger that will one day awake.

54
00:05:37,306 --> 00:05:41,740
Dizzy, you're worrying about something.
No, no, my dear.

55
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:44,403
I sometimes think, but I never worry.

56
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:48,431
Well, I'll not bother you now about our garden party.

57
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,181
But I'm dying to be bothered.

58
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:53,935
Mary, my dear, your morning tribute.
Thank you, Dizzy.

59
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:59,264
Every morning, wherever we are, you never forget.

60
00:05:59,265 --> 00:06:02,173
Nonsense, you know I married you for your money.

61
00:06:03,074 --> 00:06:05,876
Let me see our list of invitations.

62
00:06:07,077 --> 00:06:09,106
Lady Clarissa Pevensey...

63
00:06:09,317 --> 00:06:13,374
...oh, and her father and mother,
the Duke and Duchess of Glastonbury.

64
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:18,273
I'm afraid the Duke and Duchess
shiver with contempt at the very name of Disraeli.

65
00:06:18,654 --> 00:06:21,577
But Clarissa will see to it that they come.

66
00:06:21,578 --> 00:06:25,689
Dear Clarissa.
She thinks you're the greatest man in the world.

67
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,133
And she's right.
She's quite right, my dear.

68
00:06:28,477 --> 00:06:34,745
Young Deeford will condescend to come
in order to protect Clarissa against my diabolical influence.

69
00:06:34,746 --> 00:06:38,521
I'm quite sure your party will be a great success.

70
00:06:38,522 --> 00:06:43,072
Mary, I want you to invite Borsinov.

71
00:06:43,073 --> 00:06:45,146
Yes, dear.
The Russian Ambassador.

72
00:06:45,147 --> 00:06:47,330
A most agreeable gentleman.

73
00:06:47,646 --> 00:06:52,680
And I also want you to invite Mrs. Travers.

74
00:06:52,681 --> 00:06:56,378
Mrs. Travers ?
Why, we scarcely know her.

75
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:58,188
That's why I want you to invite her.

76
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:01,329
I'm anxious to cultivate her acquaintance.

77
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,059
Mary...
Yes, dear.

78
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,745
Where have I met her before ?

79
00:07:07,346 --> 00:07:10,763
Oh, we've met her at dinners...
No...

80
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,655
I mean long ago.

81
00:07:13,656 --> 00:07:17,967
I connect her with something blue and white.

82
00:07:18,068 --> 00:07:23,168
Now, Dizzy, you're off on one of your wild goose chases again.

83
00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:31,627
Blue and white...

84
00:08:06,891 --> 00:08:12,593
Mrs. Strauss.
Oh, my dear Mrs. Strauss.

85
00:08:12,594 --> 00:08:15,967
You're looking more charming than usual.

86
00:08:15,968 --> 00:08:17,722
Pease, sit down.

87
00:08:19,623 --> 00:08:26,307
Did you learn anything ?
We've nothing immediate to fear from Disraeli.

88
00:08:26,308 --> 00:08:31,830
He can't act without Parliament.
And Parliament has adjourned, thank the Lord.

89
00:08:31,831 --> 00:08:40,698
Yes, England has obligingly tied the hands
of the one man who might have blocked Russia's plans.

90
00:08:40,699 --> 00:08:46,864
And long before his hands
are free we shall have come to terms with Egypt.

91
00:08:46,865 --> 00:08:51,420
Russia will control the Suez Canal.

92
00:08:51,421 --> 00:08:56,051
And Disraeli's dream of British supremacy in Asia...

93
00:08:56,052 --> 00:08:58,850
...will still be only a dream.

94
00:08:58,851 --> 00:08:59,851
But don't forget...

95
00:09:01,455 --> 00:09:08,922
Even whit his hands tied, Disraeli can still get things from up his sleeve.

96
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:13,849
He must be watched as closely as ever.

97
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:22,711
Mr. Foljambe is outside.
Oh, show him in.

98
00:09:22,712 --> 00:09:27,010
Husbands always arrive at the wrong moment.

99
00:09:27,398 --> 00:09:30,505
Hello, Foljambe.
Hello, dear.

100
00:09:31,749 --> 00:09:34,180
Cigarette ?
No, thanks.

101
00:09:34,181 --> 00:09:38,168
Anything new ?
Things will be at a standstill at Disraeli's office.

102
00:09:38,169 --> 00:09:40,009
until he comes back from abroad.

103
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,376
I got a note from him this morning...

104
00:09:42,377 --> 00:09:44,403
...telling me I might have the rest of the week off...

105
00:09:44,404 --> 00:09:48,915
...and thanking me for my faithful attention to his interests.

106
00:09:51,116 --> 00:09:56,647
I'm afraid the great Disraeli is getting old.

107
00:10:04,948 --> 00:10:08,039
Dear Clarissa.
Dear Lady Beaconsfield.

108
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,789
Viscount Deeford.

109
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,481
My dear, you look charming.
How do you do ?

110
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:17,947
The spirit of youth and beauty.

111
00:10:17,948 --> 00:10:20,441
Deeford, behold !

112
00:10:20,442 --> 00:10:23,055
Winter hand in hand with Spring.

113
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:25,899
Innocence with...
Guile ?

114
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,831
Experience.
Same thing.

115
00:10:29,632 --> 00:10:31,729
May I be permitted ?

116
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:42,511
If something would
only happen to Charles to make him human.

117
00:10:42,512 --> 00:10:45,257
Perhaps something may happen to him, my dear.

118
00:10:45,258 --> 00:10:49,127
With the help of Clarissa.
Oh.

119
00:10:51,328 --> 00:10:58,085
What to a man of your sound judgement,
Mr. Disraeli's ideas must sometimes appear...

120
00:10:58,086 --> 00:10:59,620
Utterly impractical.

121
00:10:59,621 --> 00:11:01,828
Wildly fantastic.

122
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:06,694
The Bank of England's money
will never back any of his crazy enterprises...

123
00:11:06,695 --> 00:11:09,055
...as long as I can prevent it.

124
00:11:09,056 --> 00:11:14,093
How fortunate England has men like you.

125
00:11:14,094 --> 00:11:17,010
Why, Mrs. Travers, I...
May I be allowed to join you ?

126
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:19,592
Oh, yes. Certainly, sit down.
Thank you.

127
00:11:23,093 --> 00:11:28,267
What a heavenly spot this is.
The Prime Minister's garden.

128
00:11:29,868 --> 00:11:33,640
Why do you dislike Mr. Disraeli so much ?

129
00:11:33,641 --> 00:11:35,918
I neither like him nor dislike him.

130
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:38,719
He's nothing to me.

131
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,986
Don't you feel lonely ?
Lonely ?

132
00:11:41,987 --> 00:11:46,384
You're the only man in all the world
who neither likes nor dislikes Mr. Disraeli.

133
00:11:46,385 --> 00:11:50,611
Yes, yes. I know how much you admire him.
But we won't argue about that now.

134
00:11:50,612 --> 00:11:53,527
May you be seated, Lady Clarissa ?

135
00:11:57,528 --> 00:12:03,175
I have spoken to your mother
and she has given me her gracious permission to address you.

136
00:12:03,314 --> 00:12:07,038
Was her permission needed ?
Well, I'm rather a stickler for form, you know.

137
00:12:07,117 --> 00:12:08,705
I know.

138
00:12:08,706 --> 00:12:12,623
I consider it my duty to marry.
Yes ?

139
00:12:12,624 --> 00:12:15,229
I am much interested in the working man.

140
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:20,107
I have plans for building
model cottages with improved sanitary appliances.

141
00:12:20,108 --> 00:12:22,546
I trust, my wife and I,

142
00:12:22,547 --> 00:12:25,296
...will show our friends a model English household....

143
00:12:25,297 --> 00:12:30,809
model children, in short a model...
One moment. What have all these models to do with me ?

144
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:34,168
Have I not made myself clear ?

145
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:38,902
Since first I had the privilege of meeting you,
I have watched you closely.

146
00:12:38,903 --> 00:12:41,424
And, Clarissa...

147
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:43,764
May I call you Clarissa ?

148
00:12:43,765 --> 00:12:46,931
I have decided that in time...

149
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:51,754
you will become admirably suited
to occupy the position I have adumbrated.

150
00:12:51,755 --> 00:12:53,791
I beg your pardon.

151
00:12:53,792 --> 00:12:58,223
Adumbrated. Outlined.
Oh, thank you.

152
00:12:58,224 --> 00:13:00,566
You will think me very silly, Charles...

153
00:13:00,567 --> 00:13:02,493
May I call you Charles ?

154
00:13:02,494 --> 00:13:03,802
Thank you...

155
00:13:03,803 --> 00:13:08,323
...but is this really an offer of marriage ?

156
00:13:08,324 --> 00:13:12,338
I hoped I had made that clear
without offensive plainness of speech.

157
00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:14,466
How wonderful.

158
00:13:14,467 --> 00:13:18,161
Oh, but you have the right
to expect a high matrimonial alliance.

159
00:13:18,162 --> 00:13:20,692
I mean the manner of your proposal.

160
00:13:20,693 --> 00:13:23,823
Oh, surely...
You are a young man of 25,

161
00:13:23,923 --> 00:13:27,841
I'm a girl of 19
and you come to me with an essay on political economy.

162
00:13:27,842 --> 00:13:31,753
I'm a man of heavy responsibilities,
not a hero of romance.

163
00:13:31,754 --> 00:13:36,826
You will enter a family of which
the men have never done anything to be ashamed of.

164
00:13:36,827 --> 00:13:39,089
Have they ever done anything ?

165
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:42,424
Nothing, thank God, to attract attention.

166
00:13:44,025 --> 00:13:48,857
Well, I think the next thing will be to announce our betrothal.

167
00:13:48,858 --> 00:13:50,940
Not quite.

168
00:13:50,941 --> 00:13:56,402
I'm very much honored, Lord Deeford,
but I must decline the responsibilities and the privileges.

169
00:13:56,403 --> 00:14:00,639
I beg your pardon !
Oh, Charles, you've made a horrible hash of the whole thing.

170
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,444
Hash ?
Yes, but please, let me talk or I shall have hysterics.

171
00:14:04,445 --> 00:14:07,517
I did like you.
I liked you very much.

172
00:14:07,518 --> 00:14:12,097
But your model cottages leave me cold,
because I know the laborer wants bread, not bricks.

173
00:14:12,098 --> 00:14:14,740
And all those model children.

174
00:14:14,741 --> 00:14:19,257
I want flesh and blood children
who tear their pinafores and smear their faces with jam.

175
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,191
But Lady Clarissa...
If ever I marry...

176
00:14:21,192 --> 00:14:22,809
and I hope I shall...

177
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,507
I want a husband who is at the bottom and is climbing.

178
00:14:25,508 --> 00:14:29,923
Climbing on hands and knees.
Bleeding hands and bleeding knees.

179
00:14:29,924 --> 00:14:33,871
With his eyes fixed on the summit.
Never mind if he never gets there.

180
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:38,123
I can help him to climb, and if he falls, I can fall with him.

181
00:14:38,124 --> 00:14:40,608
But Cla...
No, you were born at the top.

182
00:14:40,609 --> 00:14:43,701
You sit in a rarefied atmosphere
like the gods on Olympus.

183
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,790
Oh !

184
00:14:49,591 --> 00:14:51,876
I see I have made a mistake.

185
00:14:57,577 --> 00:15:00,574
Well. You refused him, eh ?

186
00:15:00,575 --> 00:15:02,928
Oh, how did you know ?

187
00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:06,206
That back was eloquent of refusal.

188
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:09,985
You have no sympathy with readymade greatness.

189
00:15:09,986 --> 00:15:15,392
You refused Deeford
because he's a mere descendent and not an ancestor.

190
00:15:15,393 --> 00:15:17,673
Well, am I not right ?

191
00:15:17,874 --> 00:15:22,489
Well, he may become an ancestor, you know.

192
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,731
Tell me...

193
00:15:26,632 --> 00:15:30,348
Are you fond of him ?
I like him very much.

194
00:15:30,349 --> 00:15:33,945
If he had simply said, "Clarissa, will you marry me?",

195
00:15:33,946 --> 00:15:36,778
I might have answered just as simply, "Yes".

196
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:40,069
But he lectured me on model cottages and the model family.

197
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,897
You know, I have a very high opinion of him.

198
00:15:43,136 --> 00:15:45,849
You ? But he has no initiative.

199
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:49,829
Who knows ?
If the opportunity occurred, he might rise to it.

200
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:52,046
A man should make his own opportunity.

201
00:15:52,047 --> 00:15:55,316
And it's no use talking.
I refused him and I told him why.

202
00:15:55,317 --> 00:15:57,117
Did you.
Quite frankly.
Did you.

203
00:15:57,118 --> 00:15:59,271
I told him I must have a man with pride.

204
00:15:59,272 --> 00:16:02,051
As he is now, I would sooner marry a bricklayer.

205
00:16:02,052 --> 00:16:05,153
He does lay bricks and he may build a cathedral.

206
00:16:05,154 --> 00:16:09,351
Don't be hard on Deeford.
Go along and tell him you're sorry.

207
00:16:09,352 --> 00:16:13,881
Very good advice, Mr. Disraeli,
which I'm not going to follow.

208
00:16:18,764 --> 00:16:20,136
A telegram, sir.

209
00:16:22,143 --> 00:16:23,801
All right.

210
00:16:49,437 --> 00:16:53,351
Personally, I can't endure these Disraelis.

211
00:16:53,352 --> 00:16:59,075
But Clarissa would come...
I can't stand the fellow's confounded assurance.

212
00:16:59,576 --> 00:17:03,523
Pardon me. Sir Michael,
will you come into the library a moment ?

213
00:17:03,691 --> 00:17:06,544
There's a little matter on which I particularly want your advice.

214
00:17:06,545 --> 00:17:09,165
Oh, very well.

215
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,745
You'll excuse me.

216
00:17:10,746 --> 00:17:17,090
Mrs. Travers, Duke,
I'm sure you'll forgive me for taking Sir Michael away.

217
00:17:31,189 --> 00:17:33,218
Sit down, Sir Michael, sit down.

218
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:42,475
I've just had private information.

219
00:17:42,476 --> 00:17:45,778
Khedive Ismail Pasha is in desperate need of money.

220
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:49,841
As you know, he holds the controlling shares of the Suez Canal.

221
00:17:49,941 --> 00:17:54,504
Probert, this is an unparalleled opportunity for England.

222
00:17:54,505 --> 00:17:56,144
Opportunity for England ?

223
00:17:56,145 --> 00:17:59,812
You don't mean that in earnest.
Pardon me ? In dead earnest.

224
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:04,308
Do you seriously mean that you're thinking
of purchasing the Suez Canal for England ?

225
00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:07,167
I heave seldom meant anything half so seriously.

226
00:18:07,168 --> 00:18:11,200
And you are about to suggest
to me that the Bank of England should back you ?
I am.

227
00:18:11,201 --> 00:18:14,491
Until Parliament meets again.
Then let me tell you, sir, at once.

228
00:18:14,492 --> 00:18:16,569
I shall never consent. Never.
Wait a moment.

229
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,371
No, sir. There's nothing to wait for.

230
00:18:18,372 --> 00:18:22,195
I'll not allow the Bank to play ducks and drakes with its money.

231
00:18:22,196 --> 00:18:24,242
On an Egyptian ditch.

232
00:18:24,243 --> 00:18:27,053
An Egyptian ditch ? That's rather neat.

233
00:18:27,054 --> 00:18:30,513
They won't be ducks and drakes
because the government will be at your back.

234
00:18:30,514 --> 00:18:32,142
How do I know...
I say so.

235
00:18:32,143 --> 00:18:34,582
Suppose the government falls.

236
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,690
Dear man, it's always falling.

237
00:18:36,691 --> 00:18:38,057
What difference does that make ?

238
00:18:38,058 --> 00:18:41,743
Don't the Conservatives
invariably go on just where the Radicals left off...

239
00:18:41,744 --> 00:18:43,253
...and vice-versa ?

240
00:18:43,254 --> 00:18:46,389
Besides, in this case it hasn't time to fall.

241
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,534
This thing must be done within the next three weeks.

242
00:18:49,535 --> 00:18:52,927
Long before Parliament meets.
But why such a hurry ?

243
00:18:52,928 --> 00:18:56,619
Because Russia...
Oh, that ancient bugbear.

244
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,427
that ever present peril,

245
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:01,743
...knows of this opportunity,
they'll purchase the highroad to India.

246
00:19:01,744 --> 00:19:04,123
Then why hasn't she purchased ?
She's not ready.

247
00:19:04,124 --> 00:19:08,665
She has no fleets. But she's watching us.
She's watching me.

248
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:12,540
The spy mania.
And if she sees the slightest move on my part...

249
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,804
... she'll snap up the Canal...

250
00:19:14,805 --> 00:19:16,472
... fleet or no fleet.

251
00:19:18,973 --> 00:19:21,504
Hmm... a pretty woman, Mrs. Travers.

252
00:19:23,105 --> 00:19:24,770
Yes.

253
00:19:25,571 --> 00:19:27,804
Such pretty ears.

254
00:19:45,005 --> 00:19:51,278
Well, sir, after that delightful interlude...
No, sir. Your scheme is hare-brained.

255
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:54,361
Unconstitutional, and the Bank will be no party to it.

256
00:19:54,362 --> 00:19:57,477
I tell you there is no time...
You exaggerate the importance of the thing.

257
00:19:57,478 --> 00:20:00,148
You have the Eastern imagination.

258
00:20:00,149 --> 00:20:02,567
Because this Canal runs through a desert...

259
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:06,192
... you see it in a dream. In a mirage.

260
00:20:06,193 --> 00:20:09,627
Neat again.
The Canal is a confessed failure.

261
00:20:09,628 --> 00:20:11,904
Oh...
Whatever doesn't pay is a failure.

262
00:20:11,905 --> 00:20:14,483
The tonnage that passed throuhgh it last year...
Oh, please !

263
00:20:14,484 --> 00:20:20,814
And its filling up... filling up...
Soon the only ship sailing on it will be the....

264
00:20:20,815 --> 00:20:22,973
the ship of the desert.

265
00:20:22,974 --> 00:20:26,170
I mean the camel, sir.

266
00:20:26,171 --> 00:20:28,302
Yes, I thought you meant the camel.

267
00:20:28,303 --> 00:20:33,013
Beware of the East. Remember Pharaoh, sir, remember Pharaoh.

268
00:20:33,014 --> 00:20:36,562
Yes, but what about Moses ?
He was a Jew.

269
00:20:36,563 --> 00:20:39,413
That is, he was privileged.

270
00:20:39,414 --> 00:20:45,374
In short ?
In short, I disapprove of your imperialistic ideas, Mr. Disraeli.

271
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:48,731
And the Bank will not stir a finger to further that.

272
00:20:53,232 --> 00:20:55,600
Why are you er...

273
00:20:55,601 --> 00:20:58,420
I feared you were getting too warm.

274
00:20:58,421 --> 00:21:03,045
I rejoice to think
that I have made this rash enterprise impossible.

275
00:21:03,046 --> 00:21:05,440
Oh, but you haven't.

276
00:21:05,441 --> 00:21:07,828
Where would you go for the money ?

277
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:14,339
Where Pharaoh went. Where all Christians go.

278
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,561
I shall go to Moses.

279
00:21:16,562 --> 00:21:19,863
At any rate, understand it will be no use coming to me.

280
00:21:23,764 --> 00:21:27,181
This, sir, is definite and final.

281
00:21:27,182 --> 00:21:29,213
Nothing is final, Sir Michael.

282
00:21:29,214 --> 00:21:31,992
In the unlikely event of Moses failing me...

283
00:21:31,993 --> 00:21:34,617
I may send for you again.

284
00:21:34,618 --> 00:21:36,838
And I shall not come, sir.

285
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,681
I think you will.

286
00:21:55,782 --> 00:21:59,153
Dizzy. What were you and Sir Michael talking about ?

287
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:03,530
Lady Probert's in a dreadful way.
She's missed her husband.

288
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,007
Has she ?

289
00:22:05,008 --> 00:22:07,118
He's missed his opportunity.

290
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:10,523
Come dear. Everybody will wonder what's become of you.

291
00:22:10,524 --> 00:22:15,042
All right, my dear.
I must get hold of Hugh Meyers.

292
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:18,486
Hugh Meyers, tha banker ?
Hugh Meyers, the banker.

293
00:22:18,487 --> 00:22:21,571
That's the man, Mary. That's the man.

294
00:22:21,572 --> 00:22:24,036
Be very kind to send that telegram.

295
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:30,541
Dizzy, you're not worrying about money ?
No, no, my dear.

296
00:22:30,542 --> 00:22:33,414
Probert and I were just talking politics.

297
00:22:37,615 --> 00:22:40,930
There's Deeford.
You know I told you something might happen to him.

298
00:22:40,931 --> 00:22:43,086
Yes.
Well, it has happened.

299
00:22:43,087 --> 00:22:45,884
He has asked Clarissa to marry him.

300
00:22:45,885 --> 00:22:49,261
That will be a good match, I suppose.
Yes, but she has refused.

301
00:22:49,262 --> 00:22:54,597
Mary, I'm going to play
fairy godfather and bring them together.

302
00:22:54,598 --> 00:22:58,307
You a matchmaker.
The Prime Minister neglecting his work ?

303
00:22:58,308 --> 00:23:01,491
The less a Prime Minister does, the fewer mistakes he's apt to make.

304
00:23:02,887 --> 00:23:07,520
Thats rather good.
I must say that in the guestroom one night in the house.

305
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:10,955
I've been searching for a young man.

306
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:14,808
With such a prize as Clarissa,
Charles may become just what I need.

307
00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:20,822
Think what a splendid couple they'd make.
Oh, Dizzy. Always dreaming a romance.

308
00:23:20,823 --> 00:23:24,544
And living one, my dear, while you are by my side.

309
00:23:36,045 --> 00:23:38,307
Is it Deeford ?
Yes.

310
00:23:38,308 --> 00:23:41,562
Run along, my dear. He's eager to speak to me.

311
00:23:41,563 --> 00:23:43,820
I think he wants to kill me.

312
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,738
Mr. Disraeli.
Hm ?

313
00:23:49,739 --> 00:23:52,586
I know that tone of voice so well.
What do you mean, Sir ?

314
00:23:52,587 --> 00:23:53,587
It's the tone of an angry man.

315
00:23:53,881 --> 00:23:57,348
Now, what can have put you out ?
No, no, don't speak.

316
00:23:57,349 --> 00:23:59,037
Interruptions are annoying.

317
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:02,314
If they hadn't interrupted me
the first time I addressed the House of Commons,

318
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:05,143
I might have become a vestryman, and respectable.

319
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:08,595
Really, Mr. Disraeli,
you make it difficult to talk to you seriously.

320
00:24:08,596 --> 00:24:11,723
Never talk seriously.
Keep your grave face for your jokes.

321
00:24:11,724 --> 00:24:13,476
I, er... never make jokes.

322
00:24:13,477 --> 00:24:17,688
A man who never makes jokes is a standing joke to the world.

323
00:24:17,954 --> 00:24:23,029
Humor is of several kinds. We Oxford men have a humor of our own.
I know.

324
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,951
An unconscious humor.

325
00:24:24,952 --> 00:24:26,838
Mr. Disraeli...

326
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:29,947
Clarissa has refused me.
Yes ?

327
00:24:29,948 --> 00:24:34,081
And I, sir, I attribute her refusal to your influence.

328
00:24:34,082 --> 00:24:35,926
I see.

329
00:24:35,927 --> 00:24:39,408
I was thoroughly justified in thinking well of you.

330
00:24:39,409 --> 00:24:42,883
What do you mean ?
You have courage, or you would never say that to me.

331
00:24:42,884 --> 00:24:45,059
And why should I not say it ?
Because it's true.

332
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:48,681
And when a young man speaks
an unpleasant truth to a very old one...

333
00:24:48,682 --> 00:24:51,617
... he shows absolutely reckless courage.

334
00:24:51,618 --> 00:24:53,777
There was no other way.
A hundred.

335
00:24:53,778 --> 00:24:57,835
You take a girl's no as final ?
I suppose she knows her own mind.

336
00:24:57,836 --> 00:24:59,545
Certainly. Make her change it.

337
00:24:59,546 --> 00:25:01,647
How ?

338
00:25:03,048 --> 00:25:05,843
I'm glad you're asking me to help you.

339
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:08,918
Because I'm interested in you.

340
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:11,145
Interested in me ?
Deeply.

341
00:25:11,146 --> 00:25:16,197
Why ?
Because England stands in terrible need of men like you.

342
00:25:16,198 --> 00:25:21,390
I can't see that.
England was never so prosperous as now.

343
00:25:21,391 --> 00:25:26,358
She has a wise aristocracy,
an industrious middle class, a contented and happy peasantry.

344
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,931
Bravo, bravo !

345
00:25:28,932 --> 00:25:32,925
How many old Tory squires
have I heard talk just like that ?

346
00:25:33,113 --> 00:25:35,619
And that's how they've talked since the beginning of things.

347
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,781
That's how they talked when they lost America.

348
00:25:37,782 --> 00:25:40,157
When the Indian mutiny bashed upon us.

349
00:25:40,158 --> 00:25:43,482
When our soldiers froze and starved in the Crimea.

350
00:25:43,483 --> 00:25:50,126
When we deserted Denmark, and when
we remained idle while France and Germany flew at each other's throats.

351
00:25:50,127 --> 00:25:56,247
It's just that talk that has lost us all our friendships.
Oh, Continental friendships.

352
00:25:56,248 --> 00:25:59,418
Frog-eaters, bear-swillers.

353
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:01,873
Is that how you talk to Clarissa ?

354
00:26:02,075 --> 00:26:05,154
I do not discuss politics with women.

355
00:26:05,155 --> 00:26:07,090
I do.

356
00:26:09,191 --> 00:26:11,401
Think, man, think.

357
00:26:11,402 --> 00:26:16,137
England is as isolated as a ship lying off the coast.

358
00:26:16,347 --> 00:26:19,979
Her crew know nothing
about what they call the land-lubbers.

359
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,622
They go on shore now and then for a debauch.

360
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:26,202
But as they only hunt out the vice,
they come back with a headache...

361
00:26:26,203 --> 00:26:29,487
...and righteously thank God they're not as other men.

362
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:32,694
I tell you, a ferment is at work all over the world...

363
00:26:32,695 --> 00:26:35,289
...titanic forces take shape in America.

364
00:26:35,299 --> 00:26:37,303
Forces you have no conception of.

365
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:42,202
The spirit of nationality is aroused in France, in Italy, in Germany.

366
00:26:42,203 --> 00:26:48,305
New wine is being poured into old bottles
and an explosion will follow sooner or later.

367
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:52,776
I shall not live to see it, but I hear the seething of the yeast.

368
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,463
But you...

369
00:26:54,464 --> 00:26:57,611
my God, what things you will witness.

370
00:26:57,612 --> 00:27:00,246
Take care you are not asleep.

371
00:27:00,247 --> 00:27:06,056
All the nations must expand
and everywhere our Empire is in their way.

372
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:07,634
Russia, for instance.

373
00:27:07,635 --> 00:27:13,591
Now, while England stands alone,
while France is crippled, and before Germany is recovered...

374
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:16,681
now is Russia's opportunity for snatching India.

375
00:27:16,912 --> 00:27:23,855
With India lost, a whole fabric crumbles
and England sinks into insignificance.

376
00:27:23,856 --> 00:27:26,535
A Belgium at sea.

377
00:27:26,536 --> 00:27:29,118
Now do you see why Clarissa refused you ?

378
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:31,166
These are the things I have shown her.

379
00:27:31,167 --> 00:27:33,297
You wonder she wants a man of action ?

380
00:27:33,298 --> 00:27:37,032
You wonder she's not contented with being a mere Duke's wife ?

381
00:27:37,033 --> 00:27:38,970
I see.

382
00:27:39,671 --> 00:27:41,575
I see, but...

383
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:45,411
... but what can I do ?
What can any one man do ?

384
00:27:45,412 --> 00:27:48,422
What one man has already done.

385
00:27:48,423 --> 00:27:52,439
You, sir ? But how can I hope to emulate you ?

386
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,217
You can learn. We'll learn.

387
00:27:54,266 --> 00:27:56,090
Will you teach me, sir ?
Yes.

388
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:59,196
How can I begin ?
Leave your small ideals.

389
00:27:59,197 --> 00:28:02,733
Or better still, grow from small ideals to greater.

390
00:28:02,734 --> 00:28:05,814
You have begun well.
You're putting your house in order.

391
00:28:05,815 --> 00:28:12,336
Now pass on. Pass on to parish. To the Empire.
To parish. How small it seems and...

392
00:28:12,337 --> 00:28:15,647
...everything I've done
in politics, how utterly insignificant.

393
00:28:15,648 --> 00:28:18,471
In politics nothing is insignificant.

394
00:28:18,472 --> 00:28:20,440
Contrast it with this question of India.

395
00:28:20,441 --> 00:28:23,825
Whether we hold it or lose it.
What's the solution ? War ?

396
00:28:23,826 --> 00:28:27,728
War is never a solution.
It's an aggravation.

397
00:28:27,729 --> 00:28:31,418
What then is the solution ?
A very small thing.

398
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:34,721
A thing men are laughing at.
What, sir, what ?

399
00:28:34,722 --> 00:28:36,504
A ditch.

400
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,859
A ditch dug in sand.

401
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:46,395
A ditch ?
A ditch dug in shifting sand.

402
00:28:46,396 --> 00:28:48,760
You mean the...

403
00:28:48,761 --> 00:28:54,398
I mean that a ditch dug in sand
grows the very best celery.

404
00:28:54,399 --> 00:29:01,881
Oh, Mrs. Travers. We were just in the thick
of the the most interesting horticultural argument.

405
00:29:01,882 --> 00:29:03,503
Really ?
Yes.

406
00:29:03,504 --> 00:29:05,695
Mary !
Yes, dear ?

407
00:29:05,696 --> 00:29:09,927
Lord Deeford has done
me the honor of accepting a secretaryship.

408
00:29:09,928 --> 00:29:12,298
What ?
Lord Deeford working ?

409
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:15,759
Clarissa, isn't that unexpected ?
Not altogether.

410
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,277
And how he'll have to work.
You'll have so much to teach him.

411
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:22,348
Mr. Disraeli has already begun.

412
00:29:22,349 --> 00:29:27,059
Yes. I've been teaching him
what it took me many years to learn.

413
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,633
What is that ?

414
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:33,878
My dear lady,
that a ditch dug in sand grows the very best celery.

415
00:29:33,879 --> 00:29:36,728
Dizzy, what do you mean ?

416
00:29:36,729 --> 00:29:38,803
Celery ?

417
00:29:54,704 --> 00:29:56,654
Good morning, Mr. Disraeli.

418
00:30:05,655 --> 00:30:08,414
Oh, good morning, Mr. Foljambe.
Good morning, sir.

419
00:30:08,739 --> 00:30:11,541
You didn't tell me Mr. Foljambe was waiting.
He was not here, sir.

420
00:30:11,542 --> 00:30:14,608
These are ready for delivery, sir.

421
00:30:14,609 --> 00:30:17,561
Thank you, Terle.

422
00:30:22,829 --> 00:30:25,866
Dispatches from Russia.
Good, Deeford. Thank you.

423
00:30:28,767 --> 00:30:32,244
You might look over these figures, will you ?

424
00:30:32,245 --> 00:30:35,992
And have those delivered for me.

425
00:30:39,093 --> 00:30:41,513
Is there anything else, sir ?

426
00:30:41,514 --> 00:30:43,302
Nothing else, Mr. Foljambe.

427
00:30:47,503 --> 00:30:49,503
Oh, Mr. Foljambe.

428
00:30:52,304 --> 00:30:57,116
You have the figures about the fortification ?
Yes, sir.

429
00:30:57,117 --> 00:30:59,055
The...

430
00:31:04,356 --> 00:31:08,257
These are the dispatches from Russia, aren't they ?

431
00:31:08,758 --> 00:31:12,254
I beg your pardon, sir.
Quite a natural mistake.

432
00:31:12,255 --> 00:31:14,887
Mr. Hugh Meyers, sir.

433
00:31:14,888 --> 00:31:19,332
Ah, Meyers.
How do you do ?

434
00:31:21,033 --> 00:31:24,337
Well ?
The money is on its way.

435
00:31:24,338 --> 00:31:26,984
From the Argentine.
When will it arrive ?

436
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:28,460
In three weeks.
Good.

437
00:31:28,461 --> 00:31:30,931
To be placed at my disposal in the Bank of England.

438
00:31:30,932 --> 00:31:33,805
The Bank of England ?
That's rather humorous.

439
00:31:33,806 --> 00:31:36,970
Why ?
I was thinking of Probert.
Oh.

440
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:42,059
Deeford.

441
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:47,687
This is Mr. Hugh Meyers.
One of the world's greatest powers.

442
00:31:47,688 --> 00:31:52,909
We have to raise money, you know,
for the fortifications of the Gulf of Aden.

443
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:56,733
I hoped it was something much more romantic than that, sir.

444
00:31:56,734 --> 00:32:00,173
Oh, what ?
The Suez Canal.

445
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,630
Did you ?

446
00:32:07,631 --> 00:32:09,570
You're quite right.

447
00:32:10,017 --> 00:32:12,098
It is the Suez Canal.

448
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:14,783
Since you've hit on the truth,
it's better that I should tell you...

449
00:32:14,784 --> 00:32:18,355
...that until I am ready,
not a syllable must be breathed on this matter.

450
00:32:18,356 --> 00:32:21,281
Is that clear ?
On my honor, sir.

451
00:32:22,182 --> 00:32:23,885
Good.

452
00:32:23,886 --> 00:32:26,595
Will you come into my room, Mr. Meyers.

453
00:32:29,096 --> 00:32:32,643
Excuse me, sir.
I forgot to give you your list of engagements.

454
00:32:32,644 --> 00:32:38,772
Oh, thank you, Mr. Foljambe.
Mr. Meyers, this is Mr. Foljambe.

455
00:32:38,773 --> 00:32:40,979
Such a working man.

456
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:45,966
Let me see... what was the exact amount
required for the fortification of the Gulf of Aden ?

457
00:32:45,967 --> 00:32:49,769
You have the papers, you know, the blue one.
I'll find out, sir.
Thank you.

458
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,578
Come, Mr. Meyers.

459
00:32:57,879 --> 00:33:00,287
Do you know why Mr. Meyers is here ?

460
00:33:01,388 --> 00:33:06,450
I'm very busy.
He's not here for any fortification scheme.

461
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:08,945
He's here for the Suez Canal.

462
00:33:11,346 --> 00:33:15,461
Lady Clarissa Pevensey and Mrs. Travers are here.

463
00:33:16,548 --> 00:33:18,356
Here's an invasion.
Delighted.

464
00:33:18,409 --> 00:33:21,585
Mrs. Travers and I were dying
to see how you looked in the throes of toil.

465
00:33:21,986 --> 00:33:24,845
Well, it hasn't undermined my constitution yet.

466
00:33:25,846 --> 00:33:28,945
We expected to find you with a wet towel around your head.

467
00:33:28,946 --> 00:33:31,776
Oh, no, so far I've done nothing but look on.

468
00:33:31,778 --> 00:33:33,778
This is a wonderful opportunity for you.

469
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:37,021
That will be a bombshell for Probert.
I'm delighted.

470
00:33:37,022 --> 00:33:39,479
Well, well, well.

471
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,411
Come to see the neophyte, eh ?

472
00:33:42,412 --> 00:33:48,597
Ah, Mrs. Travers.
You know, I half expected this visit.

473
00:33:48,598 --> 00:33:54,813
Allow me. Mr. Hugh Meyers,
Lady Clarissa Pevensey, Mrs... Travers.

474
00:33:54,814 --> 00:33:56,295
How do you do ?

475
00:33:56,296 --> 00:33:58,560
My dear ladies, you'll excuse us.

476
00:34:00,961 --> 00:34:03,350
Was this a momentous interview ?

477
00:34:03,351 --> 00:34:07,209
I really cannot tell you.
That means that it was.

478
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:11,111
How exciting to be in all the State secrets.
But I am not.

479
00:34:11,384 --> 00:34:13,584
I am only an apprentice.

480
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:17,101
How humbly you speak of yourself.

481
00:34:17,102 --> 00:34:23,000
I know now that I know nothing.
That's a great stride towards your goal, isn't it ?

482
00:34:23,001 --> 00:34:25,708
Is it ?
I think so.

483
00:34:32,209 --> 00:34:39,006
May we ?
Please do. Just let an old woman rest her weary bones.

484
00:35:02,607 --> 00:35:04,735
Agatha !
Shhhh.

485
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:06,431
Meyers ?
Yes.

486
00:35:06,432 --> 00:35:07,730
About the Canal ?
Yes.

487
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:10,456
They're agreed.
How do you know ?

488
00:35:10,457 --> 00:35:12,214
Both radiant.
Then ?

489
00:35:12,215 --> 00:35:15,262
Cairo. Start now.
Yes, but I...
Now !

490
00:35:15,263 --> 00:35:17,749
Instructions ?
At Trieste.

491
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:22,274
Trieste ? How ?
By way of Ostend.
Ostend ?

492
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:27,898
Oh, hello, Mrs. Travers.

493
00:35:28,299 --> 00:35:30,326
Oh, Mr. Foljambe.

494
00:35:30,327 --> 00:35:33,215
Here are the papers giving the figures you asked for, sir.

495
00:35:33,216 --> 00:35:34,622
Thank you.

496
00:35:34,623 --> 00:35:37,079
The blue one and the white one.

497
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,107
Blue and white.

498
00:35:39,108 --> 00:35:44,621
Curious.
Mrs. Travers, this is Mr. Foljambe.

499
00:35:44,622 --> 00:35:46,965
Such a worker.

500
00:35:46,966 --> 00:35:50,478
How's your poor husband ?
No better, I fear.

501
00:35:50,479 --> 00:35:53,946
Still abroad. Taking the waters, you know.

502
00:35:53,947 --> 00:35:58,132
Will you kindly make my excuses to the young people.
They're out there.

503
00:35:58,133 --> 00:36:03,483
You're not going so abruptly.
I'm sorry, but dear Lady Probert is organizing a bazaar.

504
00:36:03,484 --> 00:36:09,732
Always occupied in good work.
Always with your hand... in some great undertaking.

505
00:36:09,733 --> 00:36:11,922
It's secret too ?

506
00:36:12,223 --> 00:36:15,223
Goodbye, Mr. Disraeli.
Goodbye, Lady Travers.

507
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:20,714
No, not a step, not a step, goodbye.
Goodbye, Mrs. Travers.

508
00:36:30,015 --> 00:36:32,586
Ostend.

509
00:36:34,587 --> 00:36:37,360
Ostend.

510
00:37:20,061 --> 00:37:22,600
I beg your pardon, sir.

511
00:37:22,601 --> 00:37:24,500
I thought you called.

512
00:37:33,493 --> 00:37:36,074
Charles ! Charles !

513
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:45,344
Very sorry, sir.
Did Foljambe make any comments about... Meyers' visit ?

514
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:48,565
Yes. I thought him rather impertinent.
How ?

515
00:37:48,567 --> 00:37:49,949
Shall I go ?
No, no, my dear. Well ?

516
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:52,521
He asked questions. But I snubbed him.

517
00:37:52,523 --> 00:37:55,965
Finally he had the impertinence
to say that you were seeing Meyers about...

518
00:37:55,966 --> 00:37:57,029
Well ?

519
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:00,244
Am I to speak in Lady Clarissa's...
Yes, go on.

520
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:02,485
About the Suez Canal.
And what did you say ?

521
00:38:02,486 --> 00:38:04,454
Not a word, of course.

522
00:38:08,702 --> 00:38:12,028
How did you snub him ?
I merely stood up.

523
00:38:12,029 --> 00:38:14,612
And looked at him.
Ooooh !

524
00:38:15,613 --> 00:38:17,183
What, sir ?

525
00:38:17,184 --> 00:38:19,386
What more could you
have told him if you talked for an hour ?

526
00:38:19,387 --> 00:38:23,708
Do you accuse me of speaking ?
No, sir, I accuse you of holding your tongue too eloquently.

527
00:38:23,709 --> 00:38:25,768
Oh, well, he's easily muzzled.
How ?

528
00:38:25,769 --> 00:38:28,554
Put him on his parole. I'll fetch him.
Yes, fetch him, fetch him.

529
00:38:28,555 --> 00:38:30,218
Mr. Terle ! Mr. Terle !

530
00:38:30,219 --> 00:38:32,825
Yes, sir. Send for the senior Queen's messenger quickly.

531
00:38:32,826 --> 00:38:34,113
Yes, sir.

532
00:38:35,414 --> 00:38:38,657
Well ? He's not there.
He's not in his room, sir.

533
00:38:38,658 --> 00:38:41,197
No. So, do you know where he is ?
He's at Victoria Station.

534
00:38:41,198 --> 00:38:45,000
Catching the 10:30 express
on his way to Ostend, Trieste and so to Cairo.

535
00:38:45,001 --> 00:38:47,917
For God's sake, sir, who is he ?
He's Mrs. Travers' husband.

536
00:38:47,918 --> 00:38:50,084
What ?
Yes. He and she are agents.

537
00:38:50,085 --> 00:38:53,215
Spies Russia has sent here
to discover what you have told them.

538
00:38:53,216 --> 00:38:54,498
Have him arrested.
How ?

539
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:58,114
On what grounds ? What has he done ?
Sir, why did you employ him knowing he was a spy ?

540
00:38:58,115 --> 00:39:00,481
Because I knew it.
Because I wanted to have the man under my eye.

541
00:39:00,482 --> 00:39:02,911
For weeks he has been secretly entering this room. I knew it.

542
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:05,255
I've planted papers I know he was trying to read.

543
00:39:05,256 --> 00:39:08,205
I had him on the wrong scent when you...
When I blundered.

544
00:39:08,206 --> 00:39:12,948
When you lost control of your features.
Would you tell us why silence is so important ?

545
00:39:12,949 --> 00:39:15,153
Now it's of no importance whatever.

546
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:20,746
Yes. You ought to know.
So that in future...

547
00:39:20,747 --> 00:39:23,000
Future ? What future is there for me ?

548
00:39:23,001 --> 00:39:26,256
... in future you may learn
to control your features as well as your tongue.

549
00:39:26,257 --> 00:39:27,425
Sit down.

550
00:39:35,326 --> 00:39:40,944
Ismael Pasha, the khedive of Egypt,
is under the impression that he is Rameses, the Great.

551
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:44,127
And the only pyramid he has raised is the pyramid of death.

552
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:49,131
Egypt is a dry bone
out of which he has sucked the last ounce of marrow.

553
00:39:49,427 --> 00:39:53,815
The last assets he has are the controlling shares in the Suez Canal.

554
00:39:53,816 --> 00:39:56,684
And these he is dying to sell to the highest bidder.

555
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:59,178
France built the Canal but is too poor to buy it.

556
00:39:59,279 --> 00:40:02,213
Russia covets it as a means of snatching India.

557
00:40:02,214 --> 00:40:04,870
England has the means of defending it.

558
00:40:04,871 --> 00:40:09,454
Both pretend the purchase
is the last thing in the world they're thinking of.

559
00:40:09,479 --> 00:40:12,468
Both are watching each other like cats.

560
00:40:12,469 --> 00:40:17,079
And Ismael sits and waits for the cat to jump.

561
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,053
Those shares I mean to have.
How ?

562
00:40:20,054 --> 00:40:23,812
The Bank of England refuses to back me,
but today Meyers is giving me a blank check...

563
00:40:23,813 --> 00:40:27,194
...and I felt the thing was done.
But now Foljambe knows, Russia knows.

564
00:40:27,195 --> 00:40:31,039
In a week Foljambe will be in Cairo
and whatever sum they offer he will double.

565
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,558
Now do you see the importance of it ?

566
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:36,395
There's no remedy.

567
00:40:36,396 --> 00:40:39,396
Of course there is.
What, sir, what ?

568
00:40:39,397 --> 00:40:41,554
I must send a man to the khedive.

569
00:40:41,555 --> 00:40:45,707
With unlimited powers.
Ready to outbid anything, ready to pay on the nail.

570
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:47,945
What must be the man's qualifications ?

571
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:52,779
A strong, stern, silent man.
Subtle and cunning.

572
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:55,591
Fighting wilyness with wilyness.
Have you such a man, sir ?

573
00:40:55,592 --> 00:40:57,170
I've sent for him.

574
00:40:57,243 --> 00:40:59,543
What is it, Clarissa ?

575
00:40:59,544 --> 00:41:04,753
What is it, my dear ?
Oh, I thought for a minute, while you were speaking...

576
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:09,217
...that perhaps Charles might...
Oh, don't say it. Clarissa, don't say it.

577
00:41:09,218 --> 00:41:13,859
Yes, do say it Clarissa.
Do say it.

578
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:17,428
For there is another kind of man who might be twice as useful.
What kind ?

579
00:41:17,429 --> 00:41:22,464
A man so honest that the rogues would think him a rogue.
So truthful, they'd swear he was lying.

580
00:41:22,465 --> 00:41:26,292
So simple, they'd never fathom him.
Why laugh at me so ? I feel my folly bitterly enough !

581
00:41:26,293 --> 00:41:30,307
What's the matter, Charles ?
Disgust. Utter disgust with myself and despair.

582
00:41:30,308 --> 00:41:31,604
Why despair ?

583
00:41:31,605 --> 00:41:33,495
Queen's messenger !
Not wanted !

584
00:41:33,496 --> 00:41:35,990
You are the man !
I ?

585
00:41:35,991 --> 00:41:38,155
I am to be trusted with this mission after what I've done ?

586
00:41:38,156 --> 00:41:41,949
Why not ?
Because I'm a useless, conceited idler and a perfect and complete fool.

587
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:44,687
Well, granting that... what, I didn't say it.

588
00:41:44,689 --> 00:41:46,697
But, granting that, that's a very good reason for sending you.

589
00:41:46,698 --> 00:41:50,437
But I've failed already.
Nearly all my successes are founded on previous failures.

590
00:41:50,438 --> 00:41:52,662
On your own showing,
no one will ever suspect you.

591
00:41:52,663 --> 00:41:56,709
You have only to meet all their cunning
with that stolid British face of yours...

592
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:59,479
... and the schemes will be disarmed. Come, will you go ?
Will I go ?

593
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,343
Ah ! There's your man of action, Clarissa.

594
00:42:03,636 --> 00:42:07,651
I warn you: there will be grave danger.

595
00:42:07,652 --> 00:42:09,992
Are you ready to meet it ?
Yes, sir.

596
00:42:09,993 --> 00:42:13,103
I mean danger of death.

597
00:42:13,104 --> 00:42:16,003
Yes, sir.
Death ?

598
00:42:16,004 --> 00:42:18,124
Every step of the way.

599
00:42:18,125 --> 00:42:21,812
Every hour of the day.
Danger lurking in every disguise.

600
00:42:21,813 --> 00:42:27,538
And once he is in Egypt, if his errand be known,
his life wil not be worth a moment's purchase.

601
00:42:27,539 --> 00:42:30,254
Oh, I didn't know. I didn't know !

602
00:42:31,355 --> 00:42:35,050
Clarissa, my child. Do you forbid him to go ?

603
00:42:35,051 --> 00:42:39,597
I ? I cannot forbid.
Yes, you can. He shall obey you.

604
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:46,928
But think a moment. If you forbid and he obeys
and I send that other man, how will you feel ?

605
00:42:47,229 --> 00:42:49,892
Clarissa.

606
00:42:49,893 --> 00:42:52,713
You must go !
Well done !

607
00:42:52,714 --> 00:42:56,251
I think I may tell him, may I not ?
That a great reward is awaiting his return.

608
00:42:56,252 --> 00:42:59,108
If I succeed ?
Whether you succeed or fail, eh ?

609
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:00,612
Good !

610
00:43:03,513 --> 00:43:06,566
Now, then. When can you be ready to start ?

611
00:43:06,567 --> 00:43:09,119
I think I could start the day after tomorrow.

612
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,198
Capital ! That will make the enterprise so much more interesting.

613
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:16,312
How do you mean, sir ?
Foljambe will have a 48 hours start with Ismael.

614
00:43:16,313 --> 00:43:18,511
You mean I shall be too late ?

615
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,761
I'm trying to convey that impression.

616
00:43:21,462 --> 00:43:24,328
Well... tomorrow then, if it must be.

617
00:43:24,329 --> 00:43:28,568
That's better.
Although Foljambe can do a great deal in a day...

618
00:43:28,569 --> 00:43:31,587
Well, there's a night mail tonight at nine.

619
00:43:31,588 --> 00:43:34,872
Now.
Now ? You don't mean...
I mean in ten minutes.

620
00:43:34,873 --> 00:43:39,609
But my luggage. I shan't even have a clean collar.
Damn your collar. Catch the Dover Express Delivery from Charing Cross.

621
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:42,945
You'll be in Marseilles tomorrow
and in Cairo a day ahead of Foljambe.

622
00:43:42,946 --> 00:43:44,802
A day ahead !
By Jove, I'll do it !

623
00:43:44,803 --> 00:43:47,057
Of course you will.
Now, children...

624
00:43:47,058 --> 00:43:50,890
... say goodbye to one another, while I write your instructions.

625
00:44:03,172 --> 00:44:07,030
Clarissa. Did you hear what Mr. Disraeli said just now ?

626
00:44:07,031 --> 00:44:11,416
The hope he allowed... of reward ?
If he had not said it I should have.

627
00:44:11,417 --> 00:44:14,882
A reward will be mine if I succeed.
Or if you fail.

628
00:44:14,883 --> 00:44:20,386
Clarissa, do you love me, then ?
I love you.

629
00:44:22,787 --> 00:44:24,608
Time's up.

630
00:44:24,609 --> 00:44:27,220
Ready, sir.
Now, then...

631
00:44:27,221 --> 00:44:31,889
Here's all you need.
Money, instructions and the code for telegrams.

632
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:37,469
I keep the duplicate. Now be on.
No, no ! Departure should be sudden.

633
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:44,121
Good luck.
Goodbye.

634
00:44:51,122 --> 00:44:54,122
And God bless you.

635
00:45:03,911 --> 00:45:06,099
Well. Now then.

636
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,987
What am I to do ? What am I to do ?

637
00:45:10,346 --> 00:45:15,560
Would you care to go for a drive ?
Oh, you're heartless.

638
00:45:15,561 --> 00:45:17,781
How am I to wait ?
How am I to wait ?

639
00:45:17,782 --> 00:45:21,697
You ? You don't love him.
No ? Then why did I send him ?

640
00:45:21,698 --> 00:45:24,210
Listen ! I've got an idea.
What ?

641
00:45:24,211 --> 00:45:29,444
Come to the country and see peacocks.
Very noble and inteligent birds, I assure you.

642
00:45:29,445 --> 00:45:30,806
Peacocks !

643
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:41,858
Well, I say they are intelligent birds.

644
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:55,530
Master, where are we going with that spade ?
What ? Why, bless my soul.

645
00:45:55,531 --> 00:45:58,568
And them dirty boots.

646
00:45:58,569 --> 00:46:00,884
Splendid morning's work, eh, Potter ?

647
00:46:00,885 --> 00:46:04,301
Don't blame me if you caught your death.

648
00:46:04,302 --> 00:46:06,717
Caught me death ? What do you mean ?

649
00:46:06,718 --> 00:46:09,550
'Tis well known you ought to be in your bed.

650
00:46:09,551 --> 00:46:11,305
Why ?

651
00:46:11,306 --> 00:46:13,700
I'm not ill.
Yes, you are.

652
00:46:13,701 --> 00:46:17,777
Mortal dead, you are. Says so in print.
Oh ?

653
00:46:17,778 --> 00:46:20,264
Where ?
Last night's Globe.

654
00:46:20,265 --> 00:46:23,061
I read it with me own eyes.

655
00:46:23,062 --> 00:46:26,777
A highly respectable sheet.
What does it say ?

656
00:46:26,778 --> 00:46:31,370
Says Dr. Williams has been seen going in and out o' here.

657
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:34,068
And that'd be true, too.

658
00:46:37,969 --> 00:46:41,645
For he just strolled by and left this bottle of stuff for ye.

659
00:46:41,646 --> 00:46:43,560
For me ?

660
00:46:43,561 --> 00:46:45,947
Oh, no.

661
00:46:45,948 --> 00:46:48,063
For Lady Beaconsfield.

662
00:46:53,364 --> 00:46:56,025
Very kind of them to be so anxious about me.

663
00:46:56,026 --> 00:47:02,185
Dr. Williams has been here twice
to see Lady Beaconsfield, who had a fainting fit.

664
00:47:03,186 --> 00:47:04,860
And that's all.

665
00:47:04,941 --> 00:47:08,730
Oh, them London newspapers.

666
00:47:11,331 --> 00:47:13,935
Ah, my coffee.

667
00:47:13,936 --> 00:47:18,046
Good morning, Mr. Bascot.
Good morning, sir.

668
00:47:18,047 --> 00:47:22,227
Is your mistress stirring ?
I believe so, sir.

669
00:47:22,228 --> 00:47:26,304
And Lady Clarissa ?
Yes, sir.

670
00:47:30,706 --> 00:47:31,984
Oh !

671
00:47:31,985 --> 00:47:35,156
Good morning, Mr. Disraeli.
Good morning, my dear.

672
00:47:37,657 --> 00:47:39,823
Any news of Charles ?

673
00:47:39,824 --> 00:47:44,619
Not yet.
Not yet, not yet. It should have come days ago, shouldn't it ?

674
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:48,912
Are you so deeply in love ?
Oh, dreadfully.

675
00:47:48,913 --> 00:47:51,340
Have you had breakfast ?
Oh, breakfast.

676
00:47:51,341 --> 00:47:56,489
Tell me. How's the secret ?
About Mrs. Travers ?
Yes.

677
00:47:56,490 --> 00:48:00,722
You've heard from her ?
Not a sound. She's keeping very quiet.

678
00:48:00,723 --> 00:48:04,896
I don't like people who keep quiet.
She might do a great deal of mischief.

679
00:48:04,897 --> 00:48:09,858
So Lady Beaconsfield has persuaded her to come here today.

680
00:48:09,859 --> 00:48:14,811
I want to have that glorious creature where I can see her.

681
00:48:14,999 --> 00:48:17,800
Ah, Mary, my dear.

682
00:48:19,101 --> 00:48:21,499
Good morning, Dizzy.

683
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:25,485
Had a good night ?
Of course I have. Slept like a top.

684
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:29,931
Sure ?
Now, Clarissa, listen to him. He doubts everybody's words.

685
00:48:29,932 --> 00:48:34,704
He doubts mine.
I never can believe anything you say about yourself, Mary.

686
00:48:34,705 --> 00:48:38,934
Do you know
what this foolish woman did a little while ago ?

687
00:48:38,935 --> 00:48:41,926
She drove with me one night to the House of Commons...

688
00:48:41,927 --> 00:48:44,170
... when I had to make a very important speech.

689
00:48:44,173 --> 00:48:48,400
The footman slammed
the carriage door and crushed her finger in it.

690
00:48:48,475 --> 00:48:49,927
Oh !
Yes.

691
00:48:49,928 --> 00:48:54,511
That poor finger.
And because she knew how distressed I should be...

692
00:48:54,512 --> 00:48:56,877
... she never uttered a sound...

693
00:48:56,878 --> 00:48:59,252
... and bore the agony unflinchingly.

694
00:48:59,253 --> 00:49:04,522
And I knew nothing about it until I got home.
How wonderful.

695
00:49:04,523 --> 00:49:09,443
Wait till you're married, my dear.
You'll be doing just as wonderful things...

696
00:49:09,444 --> 00:49:11,698
... and thinking just as little of them.

697
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:15,052
Well, if you're telling the truth...

698
00:49:15,053 --> 00:49:17,198
... you shall have your morning offering.

699
00:49:19,099 --> 00:49:23,046
Clarissa, never allude to my health before Dizzy.
Promise me.

700
00:49:23,047 --> 00:49:27,962
It worries him.
And heaven knows he has worries enough without that.

701
00:49:27,963 --> 00:49:31,452
Is anything the matter ?
Nothing...

702
00:49:31,453 --> 00:49:33,419
nothing to make a fuss about.

703
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:38,015
Dr. Williams says I must be careful.
I am, so that's all right.

704
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:41,410
Now mind, not a word to Dizzy.

705
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:46,487
A crushed finger again ?
Gladly, every day for his sake.

706
00:49:46,688 --> 00:49:50,859
The last rose of summer.
Thank you, Dizzy.

707
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,628
Telegram, sir.

708
00:49:55,929 --> 00:49:57,617
Oh !

709
00:49:59,118 --> 00:50:01,926
Thank you, Mr. Bascot.
Open it. Open it. Open it !

710
00:50:01,927 --> 00:50:05,372
Mary, do look after that silly child.

711
00:50:05,373 --> 00:50:08,571
While I read this telegram from my tailor.

712
00:50:11,072 --> 00:50:13,208
Ah !
For pity's sake !

713
00:50:13,209 --> 00:50:15,069
It is from Cairo !
What does it say ?

714
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:19,629
The celery is ripe to cut.

715
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:22,645
The celery is ripe to cut ?

716
00:50:23,069 --> 00:50:27,409
I must say I hardly think it was worthwhile going to the extent...
What does it mean ?

717
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:29,578
A great deal more than it says.

718
00:50:29,579 --> 00:50:31,220
Look.
What's that ?

719
00:50:31,221 --> 00:50:33,084
A copy of the code I gave him. See ?

720
00:50:33,085 --> 00:50:39,069
"The celery is ripe to cut".
The parallel sentence: "The Suez Canal purchase is completed and the check accepted.

721
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:42,221
Dizzy !
He did it !
Yes, superbly !

722
00:50:42,222 --> 00:50:45,475
Oh, thank God ! Thank God !
Clarissa !

723
00:50:45,476 --> 00:50:48,097
Let her cry, Mary, let her cry. It's worth it.

724
00:50:48,098 --> 00:50:50,784
How glad you must be.

725
00:50:50,785 --> 00:50:54,659
Glad, for now that other dream of mine will be realized.

726
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:57,857
What dream ?
To make my sovereign Empress of India.

727
00:50:57,858 --> 00:51:01,458
Empress of India ?
Ah, sounds well, Mary, doesn't it ?

728
00:51:01,459 --> 00:51:04,381
Mary, you shall be my messenger when the time is ripe.

729
00:51:04,382 --> 00:51:08,164
You, Lady Beaconsfield,
shall carry the news to our beloved Queen...

730
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:11,156
... and you shall be there, and you shall be proud...

731
00:51:11,157 --> 00:51:15,580
... when I stand up to announce the new title to Our Majesty's faithful Common.

732
00:51:15,581 --> 00:51:19,909
Yes, Dizzy, when will that be ?
Oh, some time must elapse.

733
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,829
This must be formally ratified.
Public opinion must be created.

734
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:25,491
Make haste, Dizzy, make haste.

735
00:51:25,492 --> 00:51:28,968
Impatient woman.
Will Charles come back soon ?

736
00:51:28,969 --> 00:51:30,643
There's another impatient woman, Mary.

737
00:51:30,644 --> 00:51:33,243
I must telegraph this to Meyers.
Yes.

738
00:51:34,644 --> 00:51:36,876
Meyers made this thing possible.

739
00:51:36,877 --> 00:51:39,513
Another Jew, Mary.

740
00:51:41,114 --> 00:51:43,384
There'll be a peerage for him.

741
00:51:43,385 --> 00:51:47,385
How furious old Probert will be.

742
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:55,590
"Hugh Meyers, London Wall.
The Suez Canal purchase is completed and the check accepted".

743
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:59,321
But you haven't answered my question !
Will Charles come home soon ?

744
00:51:59,322 --> 00:52:01,844
Yes, with drums beating, trumpets blowing...

745
00:52:01,845 --> 00:52:04,301
...flags flying.
Oh, I don't care anything about that.

746
00:52:04,302 --> 00:52:06,333
And wedding bells ringing.

747
00:52:07,034 --> 00:52:10,797
A station cab !
Can that be Mrs. Travers ?

748
00:52:10,798 --> 00:52:13,859
Mrs. Travers ?
We can't have Mrs. Travers here now.

749
00:52:14,085 --> 00:52:17,021
She'd worm this out of you in no time.
She'd read it in both your faces.

750
00:52:17,022 --> 00:52:21,364
Dizzy, you made me like her.
Well, get rid of her, send her away, kill her.

751
00:52:22,665 --> 00:52:26,448
Put your wits together, both of you.
Tell her I'm very ill.

752
00:52:26,449 --> 00:52:28,619
That I'm very ill indeed.

753
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:32,911
Hugh Meyers. It's Hugh Meyers !
Show him in at once.

754
00:52:32,912 --> 00:52:36,508
That's splendid. Is it possible he heard the news ?
Would Charles have cabled him ?

755
00:52:36,509 --> 00:52:40,062
No, no. These millionares know everything by a sort of instinct.

756
00:52:40,863 --> 00:52:46,826
If he's coming to tell us, don't spoil its effect.
Don't tell him. I'll spring it on him later.

757
00:52:46,827 --> 00:52:50,065
Ah, Mr. Meyers, delighted to see you.
Good morning.

758
00:52:50,066 --> 00:52:54,256
How do you do, Mr. Meyers ?
Lady Clarissa Pevencey you know.

759
00:52:54,257 --> 00:52:57,410
What happy winds... ?
Can I have a few moments in private with you, sir ?

760
00:52:57,411 --> 00:53:00,056
Oh, these ladies...
Forgive me if I insist.

761
00:53:01,057 --> 00:53:03,447
Why, of course.

762
00:53:03,448 --> 00:53:06,350
Mary...
You'll stay for luncheon.

763
00:53:06,351 --> 00:53:08,889
I'm sorry, that is impossible. But thank you very much.

764
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:11,166
Come, Clarissa.

765
00:53:11,167 --> 00:53:15,441
Mr. Meyers, I was just about to send you this...
One moment, sir.

766
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:17,388
I want you to hear me first.

767
00:53:17,389 --> 00:53:20,038
What I have to say...

768
00:53:20,237 --> 00:53:22,415
Well ?

769
00:53:22,416 --> 00:53:25,595
Sit down. Sit down.

770
00:53:30,996 --> 00:53:33,100
Well ?

771
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,182
I don't know how to tell you.

772
00:53:36,183 --> 00:53:39,105
It's so much harder than I expected.

773
00:53:39,106 --> 00:53:41,619
Come, come. Tell me.

774
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:43,939
Mr. Disraeli...

775
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:46,764
I... I...

776
00:53:49,065 --> 00:53:51,401
I am bankrupt.

777
00:53:53,041 --> 00:53:54,481
What ?

778
00:53:54,482 --> 00:53:59,721
I didn't quite catch.
Our house is bankrupt.

779
00:54:00,522 --> 00:54:02,304
Bankrupt ?

780
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:04,927
Meyers bankrupt ?

781
00:54:04,928 --> 00:54:07,912
You're mad ?
I wish to God I were.

782
00:54:07,913 --> 00:54:12,968
You mean you're temporarily pressed,
you're in temporary difficulties.

783
00:54:12,969 --> 00:54:16,840
I mean we are bankrupt.
But that seems impossible.

784
00:54:16,841 --> 00:54:22,989
It's the truth.
A house like yours, an historical firm,
you might as well say the Bank of England !

785
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:25,391
So I should have thought.
What have you been doing ?

786
00:54:25,392 --> 00:54:28,342
What... !
Stop. It's not our fault.

787
00:54:33,243 --> 00:54:38,267
Well ?
First our ship with the bullion from the Argentine.

788
00:54:38,268 --> 00:54:41,594
Yes ?
Gone down.
What ?

789
00:54:41,595 --> 00:54:44,171
Scuttled.

790
00:54:44,172 --> 00:54:49,139
You mean...
I mean purposely and criminally sunk.

791
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:52,334
All the crew saved. A conspiracy.

792
00:54:52,335 --> 00:54:55,054
It will take weeks, months to recover the insurance.

793
00:54:55,055 --> 00:54:56,707
And that is not all.
What else ?

794
00:54:56,708 --> 00:55:03,431
For a long time, ever since our  interview in Downing Street,
rumors affecting my credit have been spread abroad.

795
00:55:03,432 --> 00:55:07,369
And now this mysterious wreck.
I'm being pressed.

796
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:11,450
I see.
On and on this power has been working in the dark.

797
00:55:11,451 --> 00:55:16,514
My liabilities have been bought up...
ah, feel angry as you like.

798
00:55:16,515 --> 00:55:20,628
You're justified. I've been an honest man all my life.

799
00:55:20,629 --> 00:55:28,527
And now I come before you in the light of a common cheat... oh !

800
00:55:37,028 --> 00:55:39,409
Mr. Meyers...

801
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:41,333
I know you, sir.

802
00:55:52,234 --> 00:55:55,861
Tell me... you say some power is behind active in this.
Who do you mean ?

803
00:55:55,862 --> 00:55:58,541
I don't know. They're working through an agent.
And who is that ?

804
00:55:58,542 --> 00:56:02,004
Samuel Llewelyn, a great solicitor.
Does anyone else know ?

805
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:04,684
Not a living soul.

806
00:56:06,985 --> 00:56:12,314
I've come to you first because,
of course, we cannot carry out the Canal contract.

807
00:56:12,548 --> 00:56:19,165
Thank heaven I'm in time.
Thank heaven that has not gone through.

808
00:56:34,616 --> 00:56:38,259
When will it be known, Meyers ?
When will it be known ?

809
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:41,306
Tonight, tomorrow morning.

810
00:56:41,307 --> 00:56:44,739
Pray the Lord, it shall not !

811
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:46,900
Get back to town quickly.
Get to your office. Stay there. Stay there !

812
00:56:46,901 --> 00:56:50,276
I must know you are there ! Don't budge if I keep you there all night.
But...

813
00:56:50,277 --> 00:56:54,518
Don't breathe a word of this...
Don't let anyone else. Don't give the slightest hint of anything unusual.

814
00:56:54,519 --> 00:56:58,991
We have to act lightly. Watch your words, watch your looks.
Something may happen.

815
00:56:58,992 --> 00:57:02,891
Something shall happen !
What, sir ? What ?

816
00:57:03,492 --> 00:57:07,600
God knows. God knows.

817
00:57:07,601 --> 00:57:11,919
Mr. Disraeli...
Yes. Yes.

818
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:45,608
Mary.

819
00:57:47,209 --> 00:57:48,872
Mary !

820
00:57:55,273 --> 00:57:57,055
Yes, dear ?

821
00:57:58,256 --> 00:58:01,397
I want you.

822
00:58:08,498 --> 00:58:09,929
What is it ?

823
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:16,071
Mary... You've stood by me in many horrible predicaments.

824
00:58:16,072 --> 00:58:19,184
I'm in the worst I was ever in.
Dizzy !

825
00:58:19,185 --> 00:58:23,571
Meyers.
Meyers is bankrupt.

826
00:58:24,772 --> 00:58:26,420
Does that mean we are poor ?

827
00:58:26,421 --> 00:58:28,468
No. No.

828
00:58:28,469 --> 00:58:31,481
Oh, if that were all.
Then ?

829
00:58:31,482 --> 00:58:34,487
Meyers was finding the money for the Canal.
Oh !
Wait !

830
00:58:34,488 --> 00:58:38,487
Deeford has passed the check.
Now Meyers is failed, we can't pay.

831
00:58:38,488 --> 00:58:40,586
And you ?

832
00:58:40,587 --> 00:58:42,893
I ?
Yes, dear.

833
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:46,341
I want to know how this will affect you.

834
00:58:46,342 --> 00:58:48,654
What does that matter ?

835
00:58:48,655 --> 00:58:51,636
It's all that matters to me.

836
00:58:55,137 --> 00:58:57,847
I hadn't thought of that.

837
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,644
What will happen to me.

838
00:59:02,645 --> 00:59:06,714
Disgrace. Utter and irretrievable.

839
00:59:06,715 --> 00:59:10,598
The kind of disgrace no man can bear.

840
00:59:10,599 --> 00:59:15,433
No man can live through.
Dizzy !

841
00:59:15,934 --> 00:59:18,829
Yes, by heaven I will bear it !

842
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:23,242
I'll face the nation !
I'll bear it alone !

843
00:59:23,243 --> 00:59:25,375
Not alone dear.

844
00:59:30,076 --> 00:59:33,865
Thank God for you, Mary.
Thank God.

845
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,369
Have you done anything yet ?

846
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:43,507
So soon ? what could I do ?

847
00:59:43,508 --> 00:59:48,452
Shouldn't we go up to town ?
I can't. I daren't. I can't move secretly.

848
00:59:48,453 --> 00:59:51,434
The Prime Minister can't stir
without setting the whole world agog.

849
00:59:51,435 --> 00:59:56,031
The papers have said I'm ill. If I'm seen in Downing Street
now during the recess when I'm supposed to be ill...

850
00:59:56,032 --> 00:59:58,595
... every newspaper in the world would grow hysterical.

851
00:59:58,596 --> 01:00:02,926
It's horrible, Mary.
I'm bound hand and foot.

852
01:00:02,927 --> 01:00:05,111
Mrs. Travers.
What ?

853
01:00:05,112 --> 01:00:07,000
Mrs. Travers in a station cab, sir.

854
01:00:07,001 --> 01:00:09,985
I'll get rid of her.
Get rid of her ? Mr. Bascot, ask her to wait...

855
01:00:09,986 --> 01:00:12,076
Show her in when I ring.
Surely you will not receive her now.

856
01:00:12,077 --> 01:00:13,276
We must keep her here.
Why ?

857
01:00:13,418 --> 01:00:17,174
She must stay here. We mustn't let her out of our site.

858
01:00:30,675 --> 01:00:33,600
Dizzy, what is this play acting ?

859
01:00:33,601 --> 01:00:35,717
I'm ill.

860
01:00:35,718 --> 01:00:37,795
Very ill.

861
01:00:37,796 --> 01:00:43,307
If the newspapers have said I'm ill,
she'll see the sickest man she ever saw in her life.

862
01:00:43,308 --> 01:00:47,131
Mrs. Travers is here. Shall I send her away ?
No, no, no.

863
01:00:47,432 --> 01:00:51,837
Chain her. Hand and foot.

864
01:00:52,314 --> 01:00:54,015
But, Mr Disraeli !
Shhh.

865
01:00:54,316 --> 01:00:56,393
I'm ill.

866
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:10,099
Very ill.

867
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:13,445
Mrs. Travers.

868
01:01:13,446 --> 01:01:16,845
Ah, dear Lady Beaconsfield.

869
01:01:18,046 --> 01:01:22,560
I'm so sorry. I heard Mr. Disraeli was ill.

870
01:01:22,561 --> 01:01:24,695
I didn't know whether to come or not.

871
01:01:24,696 --> 01:01:27,267
I'm sure you can't want to see me.

872
01:01:27,268 --> 01:01:31,005
Is that Mrs. Travers, dear ?
Yes, dear.

873
01:01:34,506 --> 01:01:37,190
Dear Mrs. Travers.

874
01:01:37,191 --> 01:01:39,444
It's so good of you.

875
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:42,813
I'm very weak. Very weak.

876
01:01:42,814 --> 01:01:46,198
I'm so sorry. What is the matter ?

877
01:01:46,199 --> 01:01:48,394
Well, I'm...

878
01:01:48,395 --> 01:01:50,673
I'm very weak.

879
01:01:50,674 --> 01:01:55,205
I'm very glad to see you. You're so bright.

880
01:01:55,206 --> 01:01:58,039
So young, and so...

881
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:00,560
How's your poor husband ?

882
01:02:00,561 --> 01:02:04,447
Still abroad. In search of health, you know.

883
01:02:04,448 --> 01:02:06,648
Very sad.

884
01:02:06,649 --> 01:02:09,772
And you have come to see the poor sick man.

885
01:02:09,773 --> 01:02:13,160
Isn't it good of her, Mary ?
Yes, dear.

886
01:02:13,161 --> 01:02:15,906
Do sit down.... there...

887
01:02:18,407 --> 01:02:20,141
... where I can see you.

888
01:02:20,142 --> 01:02:27,455
Sweet Clarissa, more beautiful every day.
I saw the dear Duchess, your mother, yesterday.

889
01:02:27,456 --> 01:02:30,459
She seems very anxious about Lord Deeford.

890
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:32,680
He's abroad too, isn't he ?

891
01:02:32,681 --> 01:02:36,972
Egypt or somewhere.
Yes, he is abroad.

892
01:02:36,973 --> 01:02:39,376
Yes, he is in Egypt.

893
01:02:39,377 --> 01:02:44,795
I do hope he's not too venturesome.
Cairo is such a dreadful place.

894
01:02:44,999 --> 01:02:49,116
Those Orientals, you know.
One can never trust them.

895
01:02:49,117 --> 01:02:53,504
No...
So sly, and deceitful...

896
01:02:53,505 --> 01:02:54,836
Ah...

897
01:02:54,837 --> 01:03:00,591
Dear sympathetic creature. Isn't she sympathetic, Mary ?
Yes, dear.

898
01:03:00,592 --> 01:03:05,235
But don't be uneasy. We've just heard from Deeford.

899
01:03:07,036 --> 01:03:08,777
Indeed ?

900
01:03:08,978 --> 01:03:12,369
Mary,
Yes, dear.

901
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:15,736
Isn't it time I had my beef tea ?

902
01:03:15,999 --> 01:03:20,143
You say you have heard ?

903
01:03:23,144 --> 01:03:27,470
What, Mrs. Travers ?
Oh, from Deeford.

904
01:03:27,471 --> 01:03:31,514
Yes, we had a telegram.

905
01:03:33,615 --> 01:03:36,065
Where is that telegram, Mary ?

906
01:03:36,066 --> 01:03:39,273
On the table, dear.
Help me up, dear.

907
01:03:46,674 --> 01:03:50,413
Why, there it is. Under the paper weight.

908
01:03:50,414 --> 01:03:53,427
Read it for yourself, Mrs. Travers.

909
01:04:03,728 --> 01:04:07,114
Heavens, how pale I am.

910
01:04:07,115 --> 01:04:09,972
The celery is ripe to cut.

911
01:04:09,973 --> 01:04:11,718
How odd.

912
01:04:11,719 --> 01:04:14,849
Yes. Why odd ?

913
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:18,781
Well, that anyone
should cable all the way from Egypt about celery.

914
01:04:18,782 --> 01:04:23,767
Well, you know, he's engaged
in a very interesting agricultural experiment.

915
01:04:23,768 --> 01:04:27,686
You remember we were discussing
that very subject at the garden party.

916
01:04:27,687 --> 01:04:31,071
Oh, yes. And what a delightful party that was.

917
01:04:31,072 --> 01:04:36,857
And all dispersed. Lord Deeford in Egypt,
poor Mr. Disraeli very ill...

918
01:04:36,858 --> 01:04:39,186
... Sir Michael Probert out of town...

919
01:04:39,187 --> 01:04:41,040
I beg your pardon ?

920
01:04:41,041 --> 01:04:45,751
A twinge. I thank you so  much.
I've been trying to remember his name all day.

921
01:04:45,770 --> 01:04:47,425
Probert, of course.

922
01:04:51,426 --> 01:04:53,745
Is that one of the famous peacocks ?

923
01:04:54,518 --> 01:05:00,376
Yes. Dizzy is very proud of them. And of the swans.
I've heard so much about them.

924
01:05:00,377 --> 01:05:02,119
May I have a look at them ?

925
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:04,309
Yes.

926
01:05:08,410 --> 01:05:11,085
He has given them such funny names.

927
01:05:11,086 --> 01:05:16,639
She has the code. Don't let her read it.
Follow her. Stick to her.

928
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:14,800
Such funny things.

929
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:22,061
I'll show you their houses.
Oh, please don't trouble.

930
01:05:22,062 --> 01:05:23,736
No trouble.

931
01:05:29,737 --> 01:05:31,115
Mary.

932
01:05:31,816 --> 01:05:34,627
Yes, dear.
You know the Probert country place.

933
01:05:34,628 --> 01:05:38,179
You can drive there in 3 minutes.
I want you to fetch him at once.

934
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:40,360
I'll order the carriage.
Wait !

935
01:05:40,361 --> 01:05:42,975
Is Mrs. Travers' cab still there ?

936
01:05:42,976 --> 01:05:45,146
Yes.
Well, you can take that.

937
01:05:45,464 --> 01:05:48,920
But if he refuses to come ?
You tell him it's a matter of life and death.

938
01:05:48,921 --> 01:05:50,549
But Mrs. Travers ?

939
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:53,583
I'll look after her.
Mary !

940
01:05:53,584 --> 01:05:56,190
Yes, dear.
Take Clarissa with you.

941
01:05:57,091 --> 01:05:59,355
I want that woman alone.

942
01:06:00,959 --> 01:06:03,500
That must be signed.

943
01:06:11,601 --> 01:06:13,949
Yes, they are beautiful.

944
01:06:13,950 --> 01:06:17,553
And so tame.
I'm so glad you liked them.

945
01:06:17,587 --> 01:06:20,115
Do come and sit down.

946
01:06:25,716 --> 01:06:30,599
But I really ought to be going.
Oh, no. Do sit down.

947
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:33,807
Lady Beaconsfield and Clarissa have to go and meet the specialist.

948
01:06:33,808 --> 01:06:36,413
We shall be gone only a very few moments.

949
01:06:36,414 --> 01:06:38,204
Come, Clarissa.

950
01:06:40,405 --> 01:06:44,103
Specialist ? Oh, are you so ill ?

951
01:06:44,104 --> 01:06:45,600
Yes.

952
01:06:45,601 --> 01:06:48,793
But he'll cure me. He'll cure me.

953
01:06:48,794 --> 01:06:52,790
And you should stay and nurse the poor sick man.

954
01:06:52,791 --> 01:06:56,489
I'm dreadfully sorry, but...
You must stay.

955
01:07:00,290 --> 01:07:02,429
Till they come back.

956
01:07:02,430 --> 01:07:07,907
But my cab is waiting.
No. I've sent that away.

957
01:07:07,908 --> 01:07:11,223
Really ?
Now, don't be angry.

958
01:07:12,524 --> 01:07:15,118
What a dainty hand.

959
01:07:17,919 --> 01:07:20,570
Such supple fingers.

960
01:07:21,571 --> 01:07:24,331
So long and thin.

961
01:07:24,932 --> 01:07:28,850
So exquisitely shaped.
Please...

962
01:07:28,851 --> 01:07:31,926
They're so quick to grasp things.

963
01:07:31,927 --> 01:07:36,343
Unconsidered trifles, scraps of paper...

964
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:41,831
Oh, just let me go. You're hurting me.
You're in such a hurry to get away from the poor sick man ?

965
01:07:41,832 --> 01:07:44,906
To get away and read...

966
01:07:45,507 --> 01:07:47,577
the code ?

967
01:07:48,770 --> 01:07:50,341
Well ? What of it ?

968
01:07:50,342 --> 01:07:53,129
Ah... that's better.

969
01:07:53,130 --> 01:07:55,851
That's how I remember you.
Remember me ?

970
01:07:55,852 --> 01:08:01,074
So strange. When we first met at the Duke of Glastonbury's...

971
01:08:01,075 --> 01:08:04,518
... I remembered you, but I couldn't place you.

972
01:08:04,519 --> 01:08:07,896
I connected you with something blue and white.

973
01:08:07,897 --> 01:08:10,148
Milk and water ?
No.

974
01:08:10,149 --> 01:08:12,284
Snow and water.

975
01:08:12,285 --> 01:08:15,188
Mont Blanc and the Lake of Geneva.

976
01:08:15,189 --> 01:08:17,579
Geneva in the '60s.

977
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:20,769
Russian refugees and their English sympathisers.

978
01:08:20,861 --> 01:08:26,795
A man called Lumley and his ravishing... shall I say... wife ?

979
01:08:26,796 --> 01:08:29,969
No. Comrade. That was the term.

980
01:08:29,975 --> 01:08:32,677
Charming relationship. Delightful couple.

981
01:08:32,678 --> 01:08:36,657
So good to the unhappy exiles. But people are cruel.

982
01:08:36,658 --> 01:08:41,161
Thay said the good Mr. Lumley
and his charming comrade were agents.

983
01:08:41,162 --> 01:08:45,853
Decoys in Russian pay,
engaged in worming out the secrets of the refugees...

984
01:08:45,854 --> 01:08:51,482
in tempting them back to Russia,
to Siberia, to death.

985
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,622
And pray what has all this to do with me ?

986
01:08:56,623 --> 01:08:59,312
Ah, what indeed ?

987
01:08:59,405 --> 01:09:03,608
With you, the friend of Dukes and bankers,

988
01:09:03,609 --> 01:09:06,594
with Mr. Lumley and his charming comrade...

989
01:09:06,595 --> 01:09:09,649
who were driven out of Geneva by the slanderers.

990
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:12,498
And where do you think I saw him next ?

991
01:09:12,499 --> 01:09:14,364
In Downing Street.

992
01:09:14,365 --> 01:09:16,594
He had changed his name to Foljambe.

993
01:09:16,595 --> 01:09:19,486
I was so sorry for him that I gave him work.

994
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:24,661
But you did more.
You gave him instructions...

995
01:09:27,662 --> 01:09:31,266
... to hurry to Trieste. Now do I know you ?

996
01:09:31,267 --> 01:09:35,191
Dear Mrs. Lumley Travers Foljambe ?

997
01:09:35,192 --> 01:09:38,639
Well ? And what next ?

998
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:41,329
Admiration.

999
01:09:41,630 --> 01:09:45,245
Profound admiration.

1000
01:09:46,446 --> 01:09:50,669
Until this moment. Today you have disappointed me.

1001
01:09:50,690 --> 01:09:53,354
Why steal that ?

1002
01:09:53,454 --> 01:09:56,718
Weak. Very weak.

1003
01:09:56,719 --> 01:09:59,097
You had only to ask me and I would have told you.

1004
01:09:59,146 --> 01:10:06,159
"The celery is ripe to cut" means
the Suez Canal purchase is completed and the check accepted.

1005
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:12,502
Poor dear old Lumley has had all that tiresome journey for nothing.

1006
01:10:12,903 --> 01:10:18,293
I congratulate you.
Your apple-faced boy has blundered into success.

1007
01:10:18,294 --> 01:10:22,786
Ah, that's what any of us do, Mrs. Travers.
A success that will cost you dear.

1008
01:10:22,787 --> 01:10:25,495
That's the sort of thing Gladstone will say.

1009
01:10:25,496 --> 01:10:29,955
It's what the world will say
when it knows that Meyers is bankrupt.

1010
01:10:31,256 --> 01:10:37,300
The world knows what ?
Meyers is bankrupt. Bankrupt, bankrupt.

1011
01:10:37,301 --> 01:10:42,051
Mrs Travers, I'm very weak. Don't jest with me.

1012
01:10:42,052 --> 01:10:46,601
Meyers is bankrupt and his check waste paper.

1013
01:10:46,602 --> 01:10:51,793
Wait, wait. It's easy for you to tell me this,
but why should I believe you ?

1014
01:10:51,794 --> 01:10:54,677
Because it was my invention.

1015
01:10:54,678 --> 01:11:02,017
You thought to circumvent me with your apple-faced boy.
What do you say now, Mr. Disraeli ?

1016
01:11:03,218 --> 01:11:08,983
You can't expect me to say much.
I am a child in your hands.

1017
01:11:15,984 --> 01:11:19,682
Oh, Mr. Disraeli, I'm sorry to hear that you are ill.

1018
01:11:19,683 --> 01:11:21,628
I'm so much better.

1019
01:11:21,629 --> 01:11:26,215
Mrs. Travers' stimulating company...
Sir Michael Probert.

1020
01:11:26,216 --> 01:11:28,958
How do you do ?
But he's not a...

1021
01:11:28,959 --> 01:11:33,208
A specialist ? Oh, yes he is.
Why, what's going on ?

1022
01:11:33,209 --> 01:11:35,154
If you're not ill, why have you sent for me ?

1023
01:11:35,155 --> 01:11:39,000
Probert, sit down.
I want to tell you a little story.

1024
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:43,321
Don't go, Mrs Travers.
This may interest you, too

1025
01:11:43,322 --> 01:11:46,257
I repeat. Why have you sent for me ?

1026
01:11:47,758 --> 01:11:50,916
I told you I might send for you.
When ? What do you mean ?

1027
01:11:50,917 --> 01:11:54,905
When we had our last delightful interview.
Oh, I thought as much.

1028
01:11:54,906 --> 01:11:56,945
Your hare-brained scheme.

1029
01:11:56,946 --> 01:11:59,346
Moses has failed you and you had to give it up.

1030
01:11:59,362 --> 01:12:03,600
Well, it's no use appealing to me...
Moses has not failed me.

1031
01:12:03,604 --> 01:12:06,796
... and I've carried the scheme through.
What ?

1032
01:12:06,797 --> 01:12:10,908
Do you mean to tell me
that you have purchased the Suez Canal ?

1033
01:12:10,909 --> 01:12:13,215
The power and the glory of my country were at stake.

1034
01:12:13,216 --> 01:12:16,239
I had to act quickly
and I had to act on my own responsibility.

1035
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:19,418
Then let me tell you, sir, you have committed a crime.

1036
01:12:19,419 --> 01:12:22,481
As Parliament was not sitting
to vote the money I had to seek it elsewhere.

1037
01:12:22,482 --> 01:12:26,316
Five million sterling, you refused.
I did and I'm proud of it.

1038
01:12:26,317 --> 01:12:30,565
I went to the wealthiest private firm, to Hugh Meyers.
A Jew.

1039
01:12:30,566 --> 01:12:35,582
Meyers, not being a party man but a patriot,
saw the greatness of the idea and stood beside me.

1040
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:39,601
I sent Deeford to Ismael.
Spies got wind of what I was doing and Russia knew.

1041
01:12:39,602 --> 01:12:44,579
So Deeford had to go in a hurry. A race for an Empire.
He has succeeded, understand me ?

1042
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:46,942
I put the matter quite simply.

1043
01:12:46,943 --> 01:12:53,000
Deeford has bought the Canal and has paid for it
with Meyers' check drawn on the Bank of England. Wait !

1044
01:12:53,003 --> 01:13:01,440
Meanwhile, Russia has been at work,
by the intermediary of one of the most charming women of my acquaintance.

1045
01:13:02,841 --> 01:13:04,969
Meyers is bankrupt.
What ?

1046
01:13:04,970 --> 01:13:10,010
Yes. Russia has ruined him.
Mr. Disraeli, I warned you of this.

1047
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:14,992
I foresaw it. Your high-handed action
has landed you just where I said it would.

1048
01:13:14,993 --> 01:13:19,109
You must get out of it as best you can.
It's no use appealing to me.

1049
01:13:19,110 --> 01:13:23,999
No, and I will not appeal to you. I will command you.
What ?

1050
01:13:26,090 --> 01:13:30,332
You will sign this note giving Meyers unlimited credit.
Meyers ? Are you mad ?

1051
01:13:30,333 --> 01:13:32,012
I've never been more sane in my life.

1052
01:13:32,013 --> 01:13:34,429
If Meyers's position is saved, we can gain time.

1053
01:13:34,430 --> 01:13:38,425
The Bank of England must give him unlimited credit today, now !

1054
01:13:38,427 --> 01:13:41,288
You don't know what you're saying.
You don't know to whom you're speaking.

1055
01:13:41,289 --> 01:13:43,741
I refuse...
You can't.
I refuse emphatically !

1056
01:13:43,742 --> 01:13:46,913
You've mistaken your man. I'm an Englishman.

1057
01:13:46,914 --> 01:13:49,042
The head of a great national institution.

1058
01:13:49,043 --> 01:13:52,471
And I'm not to be ordered about by... an alien. A Jew.

1059
01:13:52,472 --> 01:13:56,606
The alien, the Jew happens to be the better citizen.

1060
01:13:56,607 --> 01:13:59,716
Moreover, he happens to be the Prime Minister.
You threaten me ?

1061
01:13:59,717 --> 01:14:01,603
Yes, if you force me to it.
Oh, empty threats.

1062
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:04,558
You think so ? If you say the Bank is a national institution...

1063
01:14:04,559 --> 01:14:07,508
what becomes of that title if it refuses to save the Nation ?

1064
01:14:07,509 --> 01:14:09,274
What becomes of you ?
Mr. Disraeli !

1065
01:14:09,275 --> 01:14:11,644
When it is known that the lack of patriotism of one man...

1066
01:14:11,645 --> 01:14:15,145
has placed our country in the position
of a person who is trying to pass a fraudulent check...

1067
01:14:15,175 --> 01:14:17,415
... expose the nation to the ridicule of the world...

1068
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:22,518
lost the Canal, lost India, baffled England,
beaten and disgraced her, dragged her through the mud...

1069
01:14:22,519 --> 01:14:24,802
What becomes of the Bank ?
You can't touch the Bank !

1070
01:14:24,803 --> 01:14:27,263
I'll smash the Bank !

1071
01:14:27,264 --> 01:14:29,440
Parliament's granted the Bank it's charter...

1072
01:14:29,441 --> 01:14:32,308
Parliament can withdraw it
and shall withdraw it at my bidding...

1073
01:14:32,309 --> 01:14:34,510
your Board of Directors will be swept away...

1074
01:14:34,512 --> 01:14:37,042
your shareholders bankrupt, the Bank ruined...

1075
01:14:37,043 --> 01:14:41,344
... and you displaced.
I am Prime Minister. I can do this...

1076
01:14:41,346 --> 01:14:45,968
... and if you don't sign, by God I will !

1077
01:14:47,369 --> 01:14:48,569
Now...

1078
01:15:17,852 --> 01:15:25,043
Take your paper. I have signed it.
I have signed it to save the Bank.

1079
01:15:33,544 --> 01:15:39,950
That's an outrage,
that a man like you should have such power.

1080
01:16:23,999 --> 01:16:27,472
Oh, Mr. Disraeli, thank God you have such power.

1081
01:16:27,475 --> 01:16:31,110
I haven't, dear child, but he doesn't know that.

1082
01:16:31,111 --> 01:16:32,784
Oh !

1083
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,664
She must on no account be disturbed.
Let her sleep as long as possible.

1084
01:17:15,665 --> 01:17:17,110
Yes, sir.

1085
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,282
Well ?

1086
01:17:31,283 --> 01:17:35,844
Can't tell. I'm very hopeful of the result of this deep sleep.

1087
01:17:35,845 --> 01:17:38,155
But I can't say anything more at present.

1088
01:17:41,556 --> 01:17:47,142
I can't go. I can't leave her like this.
Mr. Disraeli, I know how you feel,

1089
01:17:47,143 --> 01:17:48,806
... but you must go.

1090
01:17:48,807 --> 01:17:53,762
I feel bound to remind you
that Queen Victoria is going to attend your reception in person.

1091
01:17:53,763 --> 01:17:57,439
That is an honor she has never before paid to a Prime Minister.

1092
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:03,005
All the Court will be there.
Every country in the world will be represented.

1093
01:18:03,006 --> 01:18:05,562
And all to pay homage to you.

1094
01:18:06,563 --> 01:18:08,868
And Mary won't be there.

1095
01:18:10,169 --> 01:18:16,263
You know she always loved people to flatter me.
All England will be at your feet tonight.

1096
01:18:19,264 --> 01:18:22,725
And Mary won't be there.

1097
01:18:24,326 --> 01:18:28,308
I promised her that we would meet the Queen...

1098
01:18:28,309 --> 01:18:30,049
... hand in hand.

1099
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:34,711
How can I go through with it ?

1100
01:18:34,712 --> 01:18:38,997
The glitter, the music, the dancing.

1101
01:18:38,998 --> 01:18:44,509
And what to all the congratulations.

1102
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:46,154
Alone.

1103
01:18:46,155 --> 01:18:48,925
You've always been a fighter, Mr. Disraeli.

1104
01:18:48,926 --> 01:18:52,239
If it were possible for you to stay I would advise it.

1105
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:55,316
But you cannot break faith with Her Majesty.

1106
01:18:56,918 --> 01:18:59,377
The Queen would understand and pardon me.

1107
01:19:00,278 --> 01:19:04,373
But you are right. I cannot break faith with the Nation.

1108
01:19:04,374 --> 01:19:06,235
I must go.

1109
01:19:18,036 --> 01:19:23,152
If there's any change for the worse,
I'll send you a telegram and you can be home in a few hours.

1110
01:19:23,325 --> 01:19:25,660
Home ?

1111
01:19:26,861 --> 01:19:31,555
Without her, I have no home.

1112
01:19:58,456 --> 01:20:00,952
When she wakes...

1113
01:20:00,953 --> 01:20:02,393
... give her this.

1114
01:20:02,594 --> 01:20:05,694
From me.

1115
01:20:36,219 --> 01:20:40,545
What a day this has been for Dizzy, eh Belinda ?
It's all very astonishing.

1116
01:20:40,546 --> 01:20:43,963
They say the Queen is delighted with her new title, Empress of India.

1117
01:20:43,964 --> 01:20:47,205
And how Disraeli swayed the House
when he announced the new title.

1118
01:20:47,206 --> 01:20:49,968
Even Gladstone was delighted.

1119
01:20:49,969 --> 01:20:54,604
Dizzy is a great man.
Oh, father, so you've come round to that at last.

1120
01:20:54,605 --> 01:20:58,311
Well, there's no use denying it now.

1121
01:20:58,312 --> 01:21:01,211
I never denied his greatness.

1122
01:21:01,212 --> 01:21:04,226
Oh, Meyers, on your legs again.

1123
01:21:04,227 --> 01:21:08,275
Thanks to you, Sir Michael.
Yes, yes. Great patriotic idea.

1124
01:21:08,276 --> 01:21:11,729
Dizzy and I talked it over long before you came in.

1125
01:21:11,730 --> 01:21:15,868
So he told me.
And the Bank was a great patriotic institution...

1126
01:21:15,869 --> 01:21:19,965
couldn't let it drop.
How fortunate you saw it in that light.

1127
01:21:19,966 --> 01:21:22,510
Glad to help you. Glad to help you.

1128
01:21:22,511 --> 01:21:24,927
Mr. Meyers.
Lady Clarissa.

1129
01:21:24,928 --> 01:21:29,789
The Viscount Deeford has come home.
Yes. To think of it. I've not been allowed to see him yet.

1130
01:21:29,790 --> 01:21:34,529
Too bad. Too bad, Why not ?
He only arrived half an hour ago...

1131
01:21:34,530 --> 01:21:37,317
... and had to come straight to Downing Street.
Naturally.

1132
01:21:38,518 --> 01:21:42,446
They say Lady Beaconsfield is ill.
Mr. Meyers, I'm dreadfully anxious.

1133
01:21:42,447 --> 01:21:47,780
Nothing serious, I hope.
I don't know, and I daren't ask Mr. Disraeli.

1134
01:21:47,781 --> 01:21:52,771
Her absence tonight is such a horrible disappointment for him.
Of course, of course.

1135
01:21:52,772 --> 01:21:54,334
Mr. Disraeli.

1136
01:21:54,335 --> 01:21:56,327
Mr. Disraeli.

1137
01:22:18,428 --> 01:22:24,456
Dear Mr. Disraeli.
Lady Probert. Charmed, charmed

1138
01:22:27,357 --> 01:22:31,174
So sorry dearest Lady Beaconsfield cannot be here tonight.

1139
01:22:32,575 --> 01:22:34,402
So is she.

1140
01:22:34,403 --> 01:22:36,192
And so am I.

1141
01:22:36,193 --> 01:22:40,392
So am I.
No doubt only a passing indisposition.

1142
01:22:40,593 --> 01:22:43,207
I trust so.

1143
01:22:46,108 --> 01:22:49,373
My dear child.
How is she ? Really.

1144
01:22:49,376 --> 01:22:54,052
Don't ask me. I daren't trust myself to speak.

1145
01:22:54,953 --> 01:23:00,543
I'm horribly anxious.
Dr. Williams reassured me, or I shoudn't be here now.

1146
01:23:00,533 --> 01:23:04,580
Not even to meet the Empress of India.

1147
01:23:12,081 --> 01:23:15,364
Her Majesty is on her way.

1148
01:23:15,365 --> 01:23:22,680
Before she arrives, I want to thank those men
who have so splendidly stood at my side...

1149
01:23:22,681 --> 01:23:25,765
... and made our enterprise successful.

1150
01:23:25,766 --> 01:23:29,975
First, there's my friend, Mr. Hugh Meyers,

1151
01:23:29,976 --> 01:23:32,171
Mr. Meyers...

1152
01:23:32,372 --> 01:23:37,053
...concerning whose services I cannot speak too highly.

1153
01:23:37,054 --> 01:23:40,214
Next, there's Sir Michael Probert...

1154
01:23:40,215 --> 01:23:47,552
... at a moment of grave crisis, he came to my aid against his...
shall I say...

1155
01:23:47,554 --> 01:23:49,509
... prejudice.

1156
01:23:49,799 --> 01:23:54,038
Mr. Meyers, Sir Michael Probert, it is my privilege to inform you...

1157
01:23:54,039 --> 01:23:56,721
... that in recognition of your patriotic action...

1158
01:23:56,722 --> 01:24:00,889
your sovereign has bestowed a peerage upon each of you.

1159
01:24:04,690 --> 01:24:06,872
My congratulations.
Thank you.

1160
01:24:06,873 --> 01:24:10,226
May I add mine ?
Your grace is most kind.

1161
01:24:10,227 --> 01:24:14,948
Lastly, you'll be glad to know that my young friend...

1162
01:24:14,949 --> 01:24:18,052
who carried through the delicate negotiations...

1163
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:22,666
with such consummate tact, I refer to Charles Viscont Deeford...

1164
01:24:22,667 --> 01:24:25,784
... arrived in London half an hour ago.

1165
01:24:25,785 --> 01:24:28,548
Viscount Deeford !

1166
01:24:31,249 --> 01:24:32,455
Charles !

1167
01:24:33,456 --> 01:24:37,592
Her Majesty desires to confer the Ribbon of the Bath upon you...

1168
01:24:37,693 --> 01:24:39,298
... with her own hand.

1169
01:24:41,699 --> 01:24:43,960
Clarissa.
Charles.

1170
01:24:43,961 --> 01:24:46,116
My dear.

1171
01:24:46,117 --> 01:24:49,418
Oh, hang all these people.
Why didn't you come earlier ?

1172
01:24:49,419 --> 01:24:52,286
Well, I had to see Dizzy and get into this rig.

1173
01:24:52,287 --> 01:24:54,854
My dear Mr. Meyers.

1174
01:24:58,570 --> 01:25:00,050
I beg your pardon, sir.

1175
01:25:00,051 --> 01:25:02,558
But this telegram has been waiting.

1176
01:25:13,030 --> 01:25:17,112
Charles, I'm frightened.
Why ?
Lady Beaconsfield has been very ill.

1177
01:25:17,113 --> 01:25:19,015
You don't mean...

1178
01:25:19,016 --> 01:25:20,753
It may be...

1179
01:25:20,754 --> 01:25:22,773
...news of her death.

1180
01:25:56,174 --> 01:25:58,487
Dizzy,

1181
01:26:01,008 --> 01:26:03,359
Mary !

1182
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:08,153
I didn't know.
But the doctor sent you a telegram, dear.

1183
01:26:08,154 --> 01:26:10,154
Yes.

1184
01:26:11,305 --> 01:26:17,595
