2
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,009
Occurs in the back of the machine
something horrible ?

3
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:35,589
Slowly. Repeat yet.

4
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:39,869
What is he talking about?

5
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:45,489
That the machine is on fire.
Warned the passengers?

6
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:48,769
I guess you did do.

7
00:01:54,189 --> 00:02:00,008
People jumping out of the panic.
- It should fly business class.

8
00:02:02,588 --> 00:02:07,508
That's right, go help
people with parachutes.

9
00:02:09,268 --> 00:02:13,308
He has a vivid imagination.

10
00:02:16,588 --> 00:02:21,528
Why did he tell crazy stories?
- He's trying to get your attention.

11
00:02:22,348 --> 00:02:26,867
He said Juanita : " The washing machine
a cat. " Juanita was getting freaked.

12
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:32,587
We do not have a cat. - The economy -
the nurse must be kept alive.

13
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:38,587
What else to do in Sodom and
Gomorrah is in addition to the museums ?

00:02:39,547 --> 00:02:43,847
Let's Melissa stripparikerhoon. and
he could smoke my first joint here.

15
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:46,487
I am just joking.
- Not funny.

16
00:02:47,407 --> 00:02:50,407
Amsterdam is a mess.
I read about it and saw on TV.

17
00:02:51,407 --> 00:02:52,926
The fault is 60 minutes.

18
00:02:53,846 --> 00:02:57,046
Drugs on every corner.
Whores the window.

19
00:02:57,986 --> 00:03:02,406
Amsterdam is a beautiful and
tolerant. Kids will love the place.

20
00:03:03,346 --> 00:03:06,266
Why do not we have gone
Rome or Paris?

21
00:03:07,266 --> 00:03:12,506
We have gone there. you wanted to
spend some time with Melissa.

22
00:03:13,466 --> 00:03:16,786
I just want to be his best.
- As.

23
00:03:17,786 --> 00:03:22,225
There has been great.
Showing him the night watch.

24
00:03:23,185 --> 00:03:28,205
Let's go for a boat ride on the canals.
You will never forget this holiday.

25
00:03:33,185 --> 00:03:37,585
The time now is 16:35 local time.
It is quite chilly 18 degrees.

26
00:03:38,465 --> 00:03:41,265
It's cloudy
and rain is expected.

27

Royal Atlantic to welcome you
welcome to come again.

28
00:03:57,284 --> 00:04:01,604
Are you interested in the drugs?
I'm at work in the pharmaceutical sector.

29
00:04:02,464 --> 00:04:05,644
I do not think anything illegal ?
- I do not smuggle drugs.

30
00:04:07,444 --> 00:04:11,504
Tranquilizers. Can I get you ?
- Are you trying to bribe me ?

31
00:04:12,484 --> 00:04:16,703
They lower blood pressure. high
blood pressure to kill unnoticed.

32
00:04:17,643 --> 00:04:19,403
What ?

33
00:04:20,263 --> 00:04:26,003
No, the father did not go to jail.
Amsterdam, there are no laws.

34
00:04:26,863 --> 00:04:30,483
Enjoy your stay ,
Dr. Richmond.

35
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:39,003
Dr. Richmond !
Hey, Chris.

My wife Cathryn.

37
00:04:45,262 --> 00:04:46,622
And thou of Melissa.

38
00:04:49,542 --> 00:04:54,342
Do you know sign language ?
- My uncle is deaf.

39
00:04:55,282 --> 00:05:00,042
Farmer Uncle ? You said
Melissa is the most beautiful you see a goat.

40
00:05:01,682 --> 00:05:03,622
I meant that...

41
00:05:04,542 --> 00:05:07,662
That she is the most beautiful you see on
cow. That's what I always say.

42
00:05:08,562 --> 00:05:12,581
My car 's outside.
If we hurry , we avoid the traffic jam.

43
00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:17,101
How was your flight ?
- Melissa can not tell you.

44
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:24,761
Tulesa machine ? You gotta be kidding me.
Captain of hyppäisin Ekana.

45
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:35,901
We meet in the morning Hartman , right?
At 11 , Van der Molenin office.

46
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:40,400
Wednesday is perhaps the second meeting ,
but the rest of the week is free.

47
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,400
I'll introduce you around.
- My wife like it.

48
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,260
Have you been before in Amsterdam ?
- I do not. But I have heard of the place.

49
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,120
All is true.
- That's what I was afraid of.

50
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,579
Billy !

51
00:06:30,499 --> 00:06:34,718
What is it?
Billy Boy Manson also live here.

52
00:06:35,638 --> 00:06:38,078
Manson Five - yhtyeestäkö ?

53
00:06:38,858 --> 00:06:43,178
He left the band only. he lives in
always here during a visit.

54
00:06:44,178 --> 00:06:47,318
Hänellähän is the piercing ?
And the snake in your pants.

55
00:06:48,258 --> 00:06:52,218
I do not think live in the next room ?
- He has reserved the entire upper deck.

56
00:07:15,317 --> 00:07:19,037
Come on, Melissa.
He's not your type.

57
00:07:24,497 --> 00:07:28,637
Should I reschedule the tickets?
- Are you kidding me ?

58
00:07:29,536 --> 00:07:33,036
She plays the mother
three times a day. - The poor woman.

59
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:44,116
Richmond... - Booking may be the company
as Nelson Pharmaceuticals.

60
00:07:45,036 --> 00:07:47,776
No.
- I have a reservation confirmation here.

61
00:07:48,776 --> 00:07:52,496
Arrange this thing right now.
I'm going to ask the questions , my colleague.

62
00:07:53,456 --> 00:07:56,995
Is there a problem , Chris?
- They do not find the reservation.

63
00:07:57,975 --> 00:08:00,995
They are making a mess out. If this
clear , they will get an earful.

64
00:08:01,855 --> 00:08:04,975
That's it.
Are you tired?

65
00:08:05,915 --> 00:08:08,815
You should be.
You did not sleep on the plane.

66
00:08:10,135 --> 00:08:16,895
At home I have for breakfast. but here
hardly get cereal for dinner.

67
00:08:17,695 --> 00:08:21,595
I hope that call does not continue
throughout the night. Is wrong with the booking ?

68
00:08:22,555 --> 00:08:25,574
It will be reviewed.
Are you all right , Princess ?

69
00:08:26,454 --> 00:08:28,494
Come back !

70
00:08:30,034 --> 00:08:33,954
Billy , we loved you!

71
00:08:35,094 --> 00:08:40,814
Booking was found.
- It's about time.

72
00:08:41,734 --> 00:08:46,094
Sorry for the misunderstanding.
New computer, do not...

73
00:08:47,054 --> 00:08:49,974
Mistakes happen to everyone.
- Fill this out.

74
00:08:50,814 --> 00:08:52,673
And passport?
- Cathryn ?

75
00:08:53,673 --> 00:08:55,753
Melissalla is an emergency.
- Can not he wait?

76
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:58,773
No.
-I can take him.

77
00:08:59,793 --> 00:09:04,213
You can go with Chris.
Is everything all right now?

78
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:08,053
I think so. Passports ?
Or is it already stolen ?

79
00:09:09,053 --> 00:09:13,233
Just laugh. But I'm surprised
no matter what is lost.

80
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:19,633
Yes.
But they mean well.

81
00:09:22,732 --> 00:09:30,272
Please call if you are bored. I'll show
you the real Amsterdam.

82
00:09:31,132 --> 00:09:35,312
Here it is.
I'll wait here.

83
00:10:50,489 --> 00:10:54,589
He looks like your room
and the wife gets a spare key.

84
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:59,969
You have a message.
Sorry still confusion.

85
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:05,309
Oh, hell.
Is something wrong?

86
00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:08,689
Van der Molen wants to
to meet today.

87
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:12,888
Was not he supposed to meet in the morning?
How busy is that?

88
00:11:13,828 --> 00:11:15,888
I do not know. I ask from Chris.

89
00:12:04,607 --> 00:12:08,606
Get out of here ,
before I call the police!

90
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:14,526
I am pleased to
when Manson will fade.

91
00:13:16,124 --> 00:13:18,664
Melissa.

92
00:13:22,024 --> 00:13:24,604
Melissa ?

93
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:33,963
Are you all right , Melissa ?

94
00:14:11,382 --> 00:14:14,022
Look at the girls.

95
00:14:26,581 --> 00:14:32,561
There you are. Why Van der Molen
would like to see today ?

96
00:14:33,461 --> 00:14:37,881
He played here. At 21 bar.
Is not this wait until morning?

97
00:14:38,721 --> 00:14:41,861
Maybe he's talking about legal matters
before the meeting. Where's Melissa ?

98
00:14:42,901 --> 00:14:46,021
Did not he come back?
- He was with you.

99
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:48,861
I went to buy cigarettes.

100
00:14:49,861 --> 00:14:52,880
He was not going to the toilet.
- He 'll show up.

101
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,660
I'll still check it out.

102
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,120
Take it easy.
He looks around.

103
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:40,939
If anyone finds out , we deny
everything. I'm not doing it anymore.

104
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,079
Do not go.
- We do not have any more to talk about.

105
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:47,219
Excuse me.
- Lucas !

106
00:15:49,258 --> 00:15:51,118
Sorry.

107
00:15:55,818 --> 00:15:59,618
He is with me.
- You are crazy.

108
00:16:00,618 --> 00:16:06,098
To accept the offer , and everything goes smoothly.
- Now you can stop , Rudolf.

109
00:16:08,298 --> 00:16:10,758
This is incredible.
Drop it.

110
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:14,038
Hänetkö ?
No, you idiot. It's a weapon.

111
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,877
This is crazy !

112
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:20,717
Stop it.

113
00:16:24,037 --> 00:16:29,377
I asked , you would not kill him.
- The gun just went off.

114
00:16:30,377 --> 00:16:34,237
Do not yell at me.
What do we do now ?

115
00:16:35,217 --> 00:16:37,577
You're the boss of you.
- You fucking...

116
00:16:38,537 --> 00:16:40,437
He did not die.

117
00:16:41,497 --> 00:16:43,796
I shoot again?
No! Yes !

118
00:16:44,656 --> 00:16:48,176
Not sure ?
Decide now, the man is in pain.

119
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:52,356
Shoot , you...
- Will it shouting ?

120
00:16:53,176 --> 00:16:54,956
No. Shoot him.

121
00:17:05,996 --> 00:17:08,936
This is a nightmare.

122
00:17:10,076 --> 00:17:12,655
Just another weapon.

123
00:17:14,655 --> 00:17:18,395
Get it fast.
- Look elsewhere.

124
00:17:26,935 --> 00:17:31,155
I thought you were a professional.
I have. Want to see your papers ?

125
00:17:32,035 --> 00:17:34,735
Please help me.

126
00:17:35,575 --> 00:17:37,995
Do something.

127
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:59,574
I fixed it. My gun.

128
00:18:00,574 --> 00:18:03,534
Do we need it now?
- What a mess !

129
00:18:04,394 --> 00:18:07,933
You need to talk with someone.
- Let's get out.

130
00:18:08,873 --> 00:18:11,313
We can not leave him here.
- The body must be disposed of.

131
00:18:12,153 --> 00:18:15,493
Where to?
- Why are hired you ?

132
00:18:16,393 --> 00:18:20,113
This comes late,
but wages need to talk.

133
00:18:20,993 --> 00:18:22,373
Do your job !

134
00:18:23,253 --> 00:18:27,473
Unbelievable.
- At least he tried.

135
00:18:30,573 --> 00:18:33,293
Who is that? Catch up.
What about the man ?

136
00:18:34,212 --> 00:18:35,972
I'll take care. Go !

137
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:08,011
Stay behind the fence.

138
00:19:08,951 --> 00:19:13,111
McDonald's is just around the corner.
I do not have time.

139
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:49,570
Your child is missing?
- After going to the bathroom.

140
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,530
Age ? -10.

141
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:55,430
Did he leave alone?
- No. But he just went away.

142
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,809
Have you been looking for ?
- Let's call the police.

143
00:19:59,669 --> 00:20:01,249
We have been looking for.
Let's call the police.

144
00:20:02,229 --> 00:20:06,689
It may be an exaggeration.
This is a big hotel.

145
00:20:07,629 --> 00:20:11,009
He knows that we expect
him, and would be back soon.

146
00:20:11,869 --> 00:20:15,209
I will send someone to look for him.

147
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:17,509
No one has seen him.

148
00:20:18,389 --> 00:20:21,789
Send someone to look for him.
Look at the camera.

149
00:20:22,709 --> 00:20:24,928
Speak with a bunch of Manson.
- Melissa is not a fan.

150
00:20:25,928 --> 00:20:29,648
He can not just disappear.
- No. Call the police.

151
00:20:30,568 --> 00:20:32,708
Maybe she's been kidnapped ?

152
00:20:33,568 --> 00:20:35,488
Problems?
- The child is missing.

153
00:20:36,448 --> 00:20:38,928
Reassures parents.
We are looking for him.

154
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:42,728
What about Manson's floor?
- The girl is not interested.

155
00:20:43,568 --> 00:20:46,568
Cornelius Beaumont , Director.
-Walter Richmond.

156
00:20:47,428 --> 00:20:52,147
I do not want to cause panic , but
our girl had been gone a quarter of an hour.

157
00:20:53,007 --> 00:20:57,107
Is it stuck in the elevator ? Other problems ?
- I doubt it.

158
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:01,647
Maybe he got lost. I personally do not
always find a place to another.

159
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:07,007
Maybe it's because iästänne.
- Sir. There is no reason...

160
00:21:07,927 --> 00:21:09,687
You got it. I'm so sorry.

161
00:21:10,587 --> 00:21:17,027
We look forward to 10 minutes. If he does not
return , we will take further action.

162
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:22,686
Waiting is a waste of time. - Police
does not care about such things.

163
00:21:23,626 --> 00:21:26,006
In general, missing children
are false alarms.

164
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:31,366
Your daughter is old enough to
ask for advice, right?

165
00:21:32,226 --> 00:21:34,426
That's the problem.

166
00:22:53,283 --> 00:22:55,203
Play out , girl.

167
00:23:02,603 ??--> 00:23:04,563
Do not touch me.

168
00:23:11,222 --> 00:23:13,602
What are you doing ?

169
00:23:14,842 --> 00:23:17,022
Stick with it.

170
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,760
Who are you?

171
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,940
What are you doing here?

172
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,840
Cat got your tongue ?

173
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,920
What are you doing ?

174
00:25:23,798 --> 00:25:26,058
Son of a bitch !

175
00:25:28,258 --> 00:25:31,537
Who was that?
He was going to kill me.

176
00:25:32,577 --> 00:25:36,437
If you wanted a car radio back,
had asked only.

177
00:25:37,337 --> 00:25:38,657
Say something.

178
00:25:39,657 --> 00:25:41,617
Are you hungry ? Same to you.

179
00:25:42,577 --> 00:25:44,877
Can not you talk? It's too bad.

180
00:25:45,857 --> 00:25:49,277
I encounter a let down when I'm talking about.

181
00:25:50,157 --> 00:25:52,757
Talking is OK,
provided that the use of non- words.

182
00:25:55,277 --> 00:25:59,416
What a mess.
I should clean up sometimes.

183
00:26:02,016 --> 00:26:04,476
How old are you?

184
00:26:05,436 --> 00:26:06,756
10 years? So young.

185
00:26:07,736 --> 00:26:12,096
You can make it.
You seem harsh.

186
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:31,195
Is it a cold? Take my coat.

187
00:26:32,075 --> 00:26:37,415
Amsterdam is a wonderful city ,
but damn cold at this time.

188
00:26:39,575 --> 00:26:43,735
Where to now? I like the company,
but it would be busy.

189
00:26:44,635 --> 00:26:46,555
Any plans ?

190
00:26:47,435 --> 00:26:49,715
Is that a notebook ?

191
00:26:51,375 --> 00:26:54,734
" L'Europe " ? It's an expensive hotel.

192
00:26:55,634 --> 00:26:58,194
Do you live there?
Are you coming with me?

193
00:27:02,414 --> 00:27:08,194
Again he. Is he someone to talk
the therapist to whom you paid ?

194
00:27:59,212 --> 00:28:00,792
Where do they go?

195
00:28:08,612 --> 00:28:13,552
Are you sure?
- He was here half an hour ago.

196
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:18,511
Was he alone ? -Ol. I thought
in such a Manson fan.

197
00:28:19,351 --> 00:28:23,731
Where did he go ?
I do not know. We are in a hurry.

198
00:28:24,571 --> 00:28:28,211
He came from the bathroom
and went in the wrong direction.

199
00:28:29,071 --> 00:28:30,931
Where is he now?
- Somewhere here.

200
00:28:31,911 --> 00:28:35,691
Hiding all etsijöiltä.
- The police came.

201
00:28:38,011 --> 00:28:42,750
Ronnie... I'm sorry,
person was mistaken.

202
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:48,830
Parents are naturally
worried. But it is in vain.

203
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:53,750
How long your child has been
missing? - Half an hour.

204
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:57,270
You arguing about ?
No, he went to the bathroom.

205
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,830
Does she have a boyfriend ?
- We came to the counter.

206
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,190
Some become friends quickly.

207
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:07,910
There was no dispute and no boyfriends.
The loss is not a reason.

208
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:12,329
He can not use his voice
to ask for help.

209
00:29:13,389 --> 00:29:16,629
He hears , but he can not talk.
He had an accident.

210
00:29:17,649 --> 00:29:22,749
Please describe him , then we can
ask the services to monitor.

211
00:29:23,709 --> 00:29:28,089
You have to look for him.
Police should help us.

212
00:29:29,009 --> 00:29:32,589
The city is great. We can not look for
each reported lost.

213
00:29:33,469 --> 00:29:36,909
Most of the day will appear on
period. This is ridiculous !

214
00:29:37,769 --> 00:29:43,328
Please call after two hours ,
if need be. How does he look ?

215
00:29:46,288 --> 00:29:50,648
He points out for a girl ,
who disappeared three weeks ago.

216
00:29:51,608 --> 00:29:53,188
Did you find him ?
- Yes.

217
00:29:54,128 --> 00:29:56,088
Most of it is.

218
00:29:57,068 --> 00:30:02,108
I hope your parents
is money. Reward would be valid.

219
00:30:03,108 --> 00:30:07,787
Probably seemed modest ,
but the boat is my home.

220
00:30:09,327 --> 00:30:14,547
It is the same. But you'll thank me
all what I do for you, is not it?

221
00:30:15,467 --> 00:30:19,627
Habit is not present
little girls real Amsterdam.

222
00:30:20,627 --> 00:30:22,007
And the smell.

223
00:30:22,967 --> 00:30:26,707
Remember to watch out for needles.
And let the tip your host.

224
00:30:27,607 --> 00:30:31,467
Can you climb ?
Follow me on. Do not look down.

225
00:30:46,786 --> 00:30:49,186
Hello!
-How are you , Simon?

226
00:30:50,106 --> 00:30:52,526
Life stinks,
but this is something you do.

227
00:30:53,486 --> 00:30:55,686
Where did you find him?

228
00:30:56,566 --> 00:30:58,546
You should visit the
down more often.

229
00:30:59,486 --> 00:31:03,185
Do not hoppuilko.
Do not you introduce us ?

230
00:31:04,125 --> 00:31:07,205
Nice.
- But osaisiko to clean needles?

231
00:31:08,865 --> 00:31:12,865
If I show where the hotel is ,
if you can get there yourself ?

232
00:31:13,745 --> 00:31:18,245
Are you afraid of more and more of those guys ?
Sadly , I am busy.

233
00:31:21,645 --> 00:31:24,185
Will you take him as a " L' Europeen " ?

234
00:31:25,145 --> 00:31:28,605
Narkkariluola What is it?
- Hotel, stupid.

235
00:31:29,464 --> 00:31:33,644
Is it money ?
-On. The purse is there in your pocket.

236
00:31:37,764 --> 00:31:40,984
Here it is.
What I put my money ?

237
00:31:45,564 --> 00:31:47,684
Have a nice life, asshole !

238
00:31:49,104 --> 00:31:54,964
As well! There is no money. credit
cards and phone cards only.

239
00:31:57,043 --> 00:32:01,023
Let's call the hotel
and tell where you are.

240
00:32:01,983 --> 00:32:04,103
Soon, I'm a free man again.

241
00:32:05,043 --> 00:32:10,723
Part numbers for all
five star hotels.

242
00:32:11,683 --> 00:32:16,483
" Room 428, a suite ," I say.
" You have a package down there. "

243
00:32:17,343 --> 00:32:23,123
They will come down, and I'll go up.
Please enter your last name, so that the job plays.

244
00:32:24,282 --> 00:32:28,902
May I speak to
Mr. Richmond with ?

245
00:32:29,882 --> 00:32:32,182
I do not know the room number.

246
00:32:39,102 --> 00:32:42,402
Do you want them aboard ?
I'm not going.

247
00:32:43,282 --> 00:32:46,322
Do not responding?
I'll try again.

248
00:32:47,602 --> 00:32:50,562
Is everything all right ?
- Why not?

249
00:32:51,542 --> 00:32:54,141
How old are you?
- He can not talk.

250
00:32:55,061 --> 00:32:56,681
Do you know the man?
- Some types of...

251
00:32:57,701 --> 00:33:01,281
Is there an ID card ?
- Yes, of course.

252
00:33:02,381 --> 00:33:05,021
Stay here !

253
00:34:19,818 --> 00:34:23,838
Is she okay?
-On. We are talking about with him.

254
00:34:24,818 --> 00:34:27,778
He wrote his name and the hotel
name. Thus we found you.

255
00:34:29,278 --> 00:34:31,958
Melissa !

256
00:34:34,378 --> 00:34:36,458
What happened?

257
00:34:37,318 --> 00:34:39,958
Take it easy.

258
00:34:40,818 --> 00:34:44,597
I hope you'll understand him.
I am Lieutenant Winter.

259
00:34:45,517 --> 00:34:48,977
What does he say ?
- He saw someone killed.

260
00:34:49,877 --> 00:34:53,237
Close to the hotel.
She was chased. He fled.

261
00:34:54,097 --> 00:34:57,097
Did he murder ?
So , it says here.

262
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:02,317
Armed man chased him.
Who was killed?

263
00:35:03,317 --> 00:35:05,717
We have not received notice.

264
00:35:06,697 --> 00:35:09,177
I do not think he came up with this ?
- No, look at him.

265
00:35:10,037 --> 00:35:13,056
He was found
a known drug addict 's company.

266
00:35:14,036 --> 00:35:17,016
Your daughter fled
one partioautoistamme.

267
00:35:18,016 --> 00:35:22,456
He did not know how to drive.
No, he lost control of the car.

268
00:35:23,476 --> 00:35:27,596
Car broke down completely. jacket found
seven stolen wallet.

269
00:35:28,536 --> 00:35:32,096
It's not his jacket.
Look at the size.

270
00:35:33,056 --> 00:35:35,136
He got it from a man
that helped him.

271
00:35:36,036 --> 00:35:41,695
Who was chasing him ?
We do not know. There are no witnesses.

272
00:35:42,595 --> 00:35:43,815
Do you not believe him?

273
00:35:44,735 --> 00:35:47,835
We have not been informed of
murder or a shooting.

274
00:35:48,835 --> 00:35:51,475
Please look into the matter.
We'll do so.

275
00:35:52,455 --> 00:35:56,475
Thanks for the suggestion.
Can we go to the hotel ?

276
00:35:57,455 --> 00:36:00,635
As long as you are
available for questioning.

277
00:36:01,695 --> 00:36:05,495
They will stay here for a week and the rest
happy to help with investigations.

278
00:36:06,374 --> 00:36:11,454
Glad to hear it. - We do not
want to seem ungrateful.

279
00:36:12,374 --> 00:36:13,634
We are happy.

280
00:36:14,594 --> 00:36:19,234
If only the rest of your stay
sujuisi a more comfortable marks.

281
00:36:26,494 --> 00:36:29,054
Bluffing girl ?

282
00:36:29,974 --> 00:36:32,834
The story is just amazing.

283
00:36:34,093 --> 00:36:37,813
Sorry.
I should not have left him.

284
00:36:38,733 --> 00:36:41,653
Do not blame yourself.
Did you call the Van der Molenille ?

285
00:36:42,673 --> 00:36:44,173
He does not answer anything.

286
00:36:45,113 --> 00:36:48,193
He's probably on the way.
- Did not I come?

287
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:53,453
I 'll be fine.
I'll call you tomorrow.

288
00:37:11,512 --> 00:37:16,532
Is that blood ?
- Maybe. Or paint.

289
00:37:17,512 --> 00:37:21,332
Anything? Not now ,
As with other periods of history.

290
00:37:22,232 --> 00:37:24,812
No body, no sleeves.
Only shards of glass.

291
00:37:25,772 --> 00:37:28,372
Please check anyway.
- Is this the right place?

292
00:37:29,271 --> 00:37:34,371
This is the only access to the street.
- I call the technical guys?

293
00:37:38,531 --> 00:37:42,251
He is now in order.
My wife takes her to bed.

294
00:37:43,231 --> 00:37:48,271
So he did. Being investigated,
but none has been found.

295
00:37:49,311 --> 00:37:52,011
I do not.

296
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:58,950
Quarter of an hour to get to meet him.
I know that it's important.

297
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:06,270
I do my best.
I'll tell you.

298
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:09,450
Have a nice day ,
Mr. MacKenzie.

299
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:15,170
Does he sleep ?
- Sleeping.

300
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,450
How many of you gave ?
- Just one.

301
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:21,830
You should have let the two.
- The pills do not solve everything.

302
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:24,609
That kind of thinking
the work would take me.

303
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,729
We can not stay here.
- Hotelliinko ?

304
00:38:28,689 --> 00:38:32,089
Amsterdam!
Do not you exaggerating a little ?

305
00:38:32,969 --> 00:38:38,449
He is afraid. Someone shot him,
because he witnessed the murder.

306
00:38:39,389 --> 00:38:41,729
He exaggerates.
What do you think?

307
00:38:42,689 --> 00:38:49,169
I believe in facts. There is no body, no
signs of fighting or shooting.

308
00:38:50,109 --> 00:38:54,848
He did not invent this.
Maybe he saw the fight.

309
00:38:55,808 --> 00:38:59,088
Maybe he heard the
stories from Amsterdam.

310
00:39:00,008 --> 00:39:03,408
I believe him. - Calm down.
We can not do anything now.

311
00:39:04,388 --> 00:39:06,868
He needs a father ,
who believes in him.

312
00:39:07,728 --> 00:39:10,168
Right. But I do not think
everything he says.

313
00:39:11,168 --> 00:39:15,528
You do not even speak the same language.
Give me time.

314
00:39:16,448 --> 00:39:18,648
Four years.
I'm trying. But this is difficult.

315
00:39:19,527 --> 00:39:22,467
It is more difficult to Melissa.
- He is not an invalid.

316
00:39:23,267 --> 00:39:26,027
We should not
have come here.

317
00:39:27,347 --> 00:39:31,547
No one wanted this.
Melissa is a strong girl.

318
00:39:32,387 --> 00:39:36,647
Sleep, now. We will decide in the morning.
Maybe the police know more then.

319
00:39:37,607 --> 00:39:41,627
If you want to go more and more ,
we're leaving.

320
00:39:42,527 --> 00:39:44,947
Do not change your clothes ?

321
00:39:45,947 --> 00:39:49,306
I'm coming down , then
when he is sleeping properly.

322
00:39:50,146 --> 00:39:55,006
Take your time.
Things will , believe me.

323
00:39:56,006 --> 00:39:57,466
I'll meet you down there.

324
00:40:25,645 --> 00:40:29,545
Do I get another one ?
- Votkamartini.

325
00:40:35,265 --> 00:40:39,765
I was supposed to meet with a little
less than fifty years old man.

326
00:40:40,785 --> 00:40:43,044
Gray hair, glasses.
Have you seen her?

327
00:40:44,004 --> 00:40:46,384
At least not here in the bar.

328
00:40:47,304 --> 00:40:51,984
Want me to ask at the reception ?
- No need to.

329
00:40:55,284 --> 00:40:57,724
Dr. Richmond ?

330
00:40:58,604 --> 00:41:00,864
Hartman ?
Welcome to Amsterdam.

331
00:41:01,864 --> 00:41:05,864
Late, due to traffic
does not work in this city.

332
00:41:06,724 --> 00:41:09,944
Will van der Molen ?
- Is he not come?

333
00:41:11,003 --> 00:41:15,743
I asked her to be on time.
Well, lawyers are always busy.

334
00:41:16,723 --> 00:41:19,603
Do we sit ?

335
00:41:20,523 --> 00:41:24,083
Why did we have
to meet tonight?

336
00:41:25,023 --> 00:41:30,483
I have to go to Tokyo
tomorrow. It came as a surprise.

337
00:41:31,403 --> 00:41:35,403
On the other hand , we would
transferred to a meeting -

338
00:41:36,323 --> 00:41:40,322
I suggested that we meet today.
If it 's no trouble ?

339
00:41:41,162 --> 00:41:43,742
Not at all.
- Do you want to order?

340
00:41:44,742 --> 00:41:48,082
Whiskey. Do you?
No, thank you.

341
00:41:49,942 --> 00:41:54,362
How was your trip?
- The flight went well.

342
00:41:55,382 --> 00:41:58,042
The problems began
here at the hotel.

343
00:41:58,942 --> 00:42:02,102
Your wife and kids are involved.
- My wife and one daughter.

344
00:42:03,082 --> 00:42:08,321
Did they steal your credit card ?
- My daughter disappeared from the hotel.

345
00:42:09,181 --> 00:42:12,581
He was lost hour.
Police found him -

346
00:42:13,581 --> 00:42:16,721
and he told
the most incredible story.

347
00:42:17,741 --> 00:42:19,901
I like the incredible stories.

348
00:42:20,901 --> 00:42:25,001
He said he saw the murder and
that the armed man was chasing him.

349
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:29,081
Are you kidding?
- Police are investigating the matter.

350
00:42:30,101 --> 00:42:33,720
Did you find anything?
- No. You'd be surprised if there was.

351
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:41,360
Kids can you
incredible stuff.

352
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,620
He certainly saw something.
But there is nothing so exciting.

353
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:50,340
Yeah, right. where
Richmond is a lovely lady ?

354
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,860
She will come soon.
- Great.

355
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:56,720
delay does not
Van der Molenin not like that.

356
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:02,159
I'll call the office.
Maybe something unexpected happened.

357
00:43:03,579 --> 00:43:07,659
Excuse me.
I'll be back soon.

358
00:43:29,438 --> 00:43:31,898
I have found the girl.

359
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:38,798
231 ?
Job done.

360
00:43:51,078 --> 00:43:54,078
Did you hear anything?
He is certainly on the way.

361
00:43:55,018 --> 00:43:58,497
I wish I would have. I would like to
agreement made ??before I left.

362
00:43:59,437 --> 00:44:02,177
What happens in Tokyo ?
- Business Meeting.

363
00:44:03,157 --> 00:44:07,097
" Kyoto Medical " with ?
- That is correct.

364
00:44:08,097 --> 00:44:10,177
I know what you're thinking ,
but you are wrong.

365
00:44:11,177 --> 00:44:13,997
I just business
I believe in honesty.

366
00:44:14,997 --> 00:44:19,517
Lucas did not always agree ,
but I think a promise is a promise.

367
00:44:20,437 --> 00:44:26,356
And we can take care of this
the case right now , without lawyers.

368
00:44:27,396 --> 00:44:32,356
Just need to sign the papers.
Buy the size of Lucas champagne.

369
00:44:33,356 --> 00:44:36,956
That sounds good.
- We can take care of it quickly.

370
00:44:41,496 --> 00:44:46,576
We agree on the way, but
the first one to talk.

371
00:44:47,596 --> 00:44:53,555
Our lawyers questioned whether the signature
amount, but to persuade them.

372
00:44:54,435 --> 00:44:59,635
Lucas likes it. his
their conditions were pretty steep.

373
00:45:00,595 --> 00:45:03,995
You agreeing.
- Hepatic that he is awkward.

374
00:45:04,955 --> 00:45:08,575
But such an agreement to give you
's advantage over its rivals.

375
00:45:09,635 --> 00:45:12,395
And it shows
to pay the sum.

376
00:45:13,275 --> 00:45:16,655
Now we only need
the missing data.

377
00:45:17,575 --> 00:45:21,134
What ? I thought that Lucas sent
them a week ago Friday.

378
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:25,314
We need the originals.
You know the lawyers in the United States.

379
00:45:26,234 --> 00:45:30,274
Van der Molenin had to deal with it.
- They may be with him.

380
00:45:31,234 --> 00:45:33,494
Most likely.

381
00:45:34,374 --> 00:45:38,154
If I had known ,
I would have handled the case.

382
00:45:39,014 --> 00:45:42,074
We have to wait
Van der Molenia.

383
00:45:43,014 --> 00:45:46,953
What if he does not come?
- Why not come?

384
00:45:47,933 --> 00:45:50,613
Maybe he forgot.
Or he's sitting in a traffic jam.

385
00:45:51,453 --> 00:45:54,073
We need to
to postpone the signing.

386
00:45:54,953 --> 00:45:57,933
But I have to be
Tokyo tomorrow night.

387
00:45:58,873 --> 00:46:01,713
Unfortunate.
But my hands are tied.

388
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:07,853
Then we have a problem.
- Sorry.

389
00:46:09,693 --> 00:46:12,773
Cathryn , this is Mr. Hartman.

390
00:46:13,753 --> 00:46:18,432
We look forward to Van der Molenia.
Nice to meet you.

391
00:46:19,312 --> 00:46:22,392
I guess I interrupted anything.
- We were finishing up.

392
00:46:23,212 --> 00:46:26,112
How to Melissa ?
- Good. He sleeps.

393
00:46:27,012 --> 00:46:31,172
I can call my boss
and ask for his opinion.

394
00:46:32,212 --> 00:46:34,852
I would like to conclude the contract
which no one is satisfied.

395
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:40,912
I'm trying. lawyers make
work for us , not vice versa.

396
00:46:44,291 --> 00:46:49,231
How can your daughter ?
Your husband told me what happened.

397
00:46:50,071 --> 00:46:54,271
I wish she would recover the incident.
We put him to bed.

398
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:58,631
Sleep helps , yes.

399
00:46:59,631 --> 00:47:03,071
Suzy , this Walter.

400
00:47:04,031 --> 00:47:09,371
Not quite, but I will tell later.
May I speak with MacKenzie ?

401
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:14,730
Lunch? Ask him to call.
This is important.

402
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:18,950
The hotel , yes.

403
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:25,390
I'm sorry !

404
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:34,890
It is lunch time.
He'll call as soon as he gets back.

405
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:37,989
How long does it take?
-Hour.

406
00:47:38,869 --> 00:47:41,129
So long?

407
00:47:42,069 --> 00:47:47,949
We eat together? our
My wife and I had to eat here.

408
00:47:49,009 --> 00:47:51,949
I do not know... - If you 're lucky ,
we can lift the basins trade.

409
00:47:52,909 --> 00:47:56,069
Perhaps Van der Molen
time to desserts.

410
00:47:57,009 --> 00:48:01,029
Yes for me would be nice.
If it indeed is.

411
00:48:02,049 --> 00:48:05,149
The restaurant should be
the best in town. - Let's find out.

412
00:48:06,788 --> 00:48:10,428
Have you heard of croquette ,
that exploded ? -Do not attempt.

413
00:48:11,408 --> 00:48:13,848
The guy got
really severe burns.

414
00:48:14,908 --> 00:48:17,588
Be called the bomb squad place
before you take a bite ?

415
00:48:18,648 --> 00:48:22,848
As long as the alarm. - You sound like a
like my mother before my wedding.

416
00:48:23,848 --> 00:48:27,348
Winter.
Was he sure?

417
00:48:28,228 --> 00:48:32,168
Did you talk to yourself with her?
To the sounds.

418
00:48:33,067 --> 00:48:35,627
We eat a little
and we will show up.

419
00:48:36,627 --> 00:48:41,627
It was human blood.
And shots were heard.

420
00:48:42,507 --> 00:48:44,487
The girl may have been right ?
- The body is missing.

421
00:48:45,427 --> 00:48:48,427
Do you want to question him ?
Wake him up ?

422
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:53,267
You are sick. Tomorrow will be enough.
He's not going anywhere.

423
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:35,483
Table for three.
Thank you.

424
00:50:36,503 --> 00:50:38,783
Follow me, please.

425
00:50:44,703 --> 00:50:47,203
Thank you.

426
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:55,382

427
00:50:56,302 --> 00:50:59,762
Can I get you something to drink?
- Wine.

428
00:51:00,722 --> 00:51:04,162
Whiskey. And a bottle of
non-carbonated mineral water.

429
00:51:05,782 --> 00:51:08,122
Not a bad idea.

430
00:51:11,342 --> 00:51:16,162
What happened to Van der Molenille ?
- What do you mean ?

431
00:51:17,142 --> 00:51:19,221
What happened to your lawyer ?

432
00:51:20,141 --> 00:51:22,621
We do not know.
He did not come.

433
00:51:23,541 --> 00:51:27,561
Mr. and Mrs. Richmond ?
Spare keys.

434
00:51:28,501 --> 00:51:30,381
Thank you very much.

435
00:51:31,981 --> 00:51:34,701
Do not you got a key?
- Some confusion.

436
00:51:35,761 --> 00:51:38,561
We moved to another room.
- You moved ?

437
00:51:39,401 --> 00:51:41,161
A suite for the same price.

438
00:51:42,061 --> 00:51:44,621
The great thing about the service.

439
00:51:46,141 --> 00:51:49,080
Excuse me.

440
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:51,980
You gave me the wrong number.

441
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,780
Mr. Peters ? How's it going ?

442
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:00,580
I've changed my mind.
- This is me. Bruno.

443
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:05,660
Let's talk briefly.
I'm having dinner with my friends.

444
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:10,080
Your offer was slightly
overestimated. You will understand.

445
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,800
What the fuck?

446
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:19,979
But I'm feeling generous
and I can accept...

447
00:52:23,159 --> 00:52:26,439
Accept what?
Well...

448
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:34,919
45 500
-45 To 500 ? What are you talking about?

449
00:52:35,859 --> 00:52:38,979
It 's my final offer.

450
00:52:40,419 --> 00:52:44,758
Now I get it.
You can not talk.

451
00:52:45,638 --> 00:52:50,978
You're so sharp.
45.5, and no more.

452
00:52:51,998 --> 00:52:55,418
Room 455, does not it?
- That is correct.

453
00:52:56,358 --> 00:52:59,658
Whether it's clever.
- You are responsible soon as possible.

454
00:53:00,618 --> 00:53:02,258
I'm on my way.

455
00:53:03,218 --> 00:53:09,698
Swimming pool building is difficult.
I should not have bothered.

456
00:53:20,957 --> 00:53:26,257
What stateful ?
- I love the " Lobster Thermidor."

457
00:53:27,697 --> 00:53:32,697
Looking for something? - Reading glasses.
I left them in a safe top.

458
00:53:33,637 --> 00:53:36,797
Room?
I'll go get them.

459
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:44,156
I can read the menu to you.
They're important to me , anyway.

460
00:53:47,676 --> 00:53:53,976
That's not only due to the lenses. he is
Melissa 's house. You know the mothers.

461
00:54:00,776 --> 00:54:04,336
I'll go take a leak.
See you later , Henry.

462
00:54:16,335 --> 00:54:22,975
One of Amsterdam 's oldest
churches is shown on the right.

463
00:54:44,674 --> 00:54:49,054
DO NOT DISTURB

464
00:56:16,171 --> 00:56:19,251
It's me , honey.

465
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:22,971
Wait a minute.

466
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:30,110
We eat dinner downstairs.

467
00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:34,890
I came to get my glasses.
Go back to sleep. We will not be for long.

468
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:40,790
Can I get you something ?

469
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:46,270
Of course, I
not angry with you.

470
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:50,970
I love you too.

471
00:56:51,889 --> 00:56:56,749
Get some rest.
Sweet dreams.

472
00:59:04,965 --> 00:59:07,665
I'm so sorry.
Was everything all right?

473
00:59:08,565 --> 00:59:11,524
It was. He woke up.
But you probably already fell asleep again.

474
00:59:12,444 --> 00:59:14,424
Oh, great.

475
01:00:03,983 --> 01:00:06,702
I cut myself shaving myself.

476
01:00:07,662 --> 01:00:09,242
I am the last ;
who believes partaveitsiin.

477
01:00:34,961 --> 01:00:39,521
Malaria is on the way to the north.
- " El Niño ".

478
01:00:54,621 --> 01:00:57,421
Good evening.

479
01:01:29,239 --> 01:01:32,019
One of the lifts froze up , Tom.

480
01:02:03,758 --> 01:02:05,738
Little bitch !

481
01:03:16,316 --> 01:03:18,696
Where do you think you're going ?

482
01:03:19,655 --> 01:03:22,675
Ricky Mitch.
- Mitch here.

483
01:03:23,535 --> 01:03:26,115
Pikutyttö slipped right through.

484
01:03:26,955 --> 01:03:30,455
Behave properly.
And keep your mouth shut.

485
01:03:40,335 --> 01:03:45,535
Do you see anything ? someone
probably set off the alarm.

486
01:03:49,314 --> 01:03:51,734
That's it.
What is on the floor ?

487
01:03:52,694 --> 01:03:57,874
Red wine , tomato juice.
I do not know. Call the cleaning.

488
01:04:05,614 --> 01:04:11,274
The good you do not have them kirkujia.
Does not interfere with the beauty of Billy Boy's dreams.

489
01:04:12,174 --> 01:04:17,233
Did you want him for the night ?
Carefully. I get mad easily.

490
01:04:19,693 --> 01:04:24,953
My rave-up , right , Ricky ?
- She managed to get through it.

491
01:04:25,873 --> 01:04:29,813
Wanted very much to see me, huh?
- He will be sought.

492
01:04:30,673 --> 01:04:32,373
We show a little
hospitality.

493
01:04:33,533 --> 01:04:38,873
Girls are freezing.
Will you take something warm ?

494
01:04:39,933 --> 01:04:45,092
The rules prohibit this.
- Who will pay for hired?

495
01:04:47,072 --> 01:04:52,092
She has the initiative.
Hormones are a rage across.

496
01:04:55,372 --> 01:04:59,832
Ricky Mitch.
- Mitch here.

497
01:05:01,112 --> 01:05:08,112
Come on. There was not a girl.
And Billy taken by girls in.

498
01:05:11,831 --> 01:05:15,231
Come and sit by my side.

499
01:05:16,111 --> 01:05:20,531
You do not like cartoons ?
I love cartoons.

500
01:05:21,431 --> 01:05:24,651
We can look more
if you want to. My dear.

501
01:05:26,871 --> 01:05:30,591
How's the donut ?
Is not it?

502
01:05:34,071 --> 01:05:39,050
What are you doing ?
Do you write me a love letter ?

503
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:47,550
You smell good.
Like a pristine flower in morning dew.

504
01:05:48,510 --> 01:05:50,910
Want to see my snake ?

505
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:54,430
Whether you themselves.

506
01:05:55,790 --> 01:05:59,930
Do you want to wrestle first?
We can have pillow fights.

507
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:05,769
What is that? The list of wishes ?

508
01:06:12,589 --> 01:06:16,769
" My name is Melissa Richmond
and I can not talk about. "

509
01:06:17,649 --> 01:06:23,949
" I live in a hotel.
Call... the police ? "

510
01:06:26,189 --> 01:06:31,589
What kind of crap is this?
I barely inches to you.

511
01:06:32,568 --> 01:06:36,408
Do you want to have to back to jail ?
Who sent you ?

512
01:06:37,428 --> 01:06:42,648
Are you on drugs the police?
This is an ambush.

513
01:06:45,508 --> 01:06:48,148
I thought that this city
is tolerant.

514
01:06:49,068 --> 01:06:51,648
Ricky , what is this?

515
01:06:55,648 --> 01:06:57,868
What the...

516
01:07:00,607 --> 01:07:04,227
More fans , huh?
Heavy - metal , right?

517
01:07:05,207 --> 01:07:07,907
Here you have the metal.

518
01:07:58,125 --> 01:08:02,505
Have you always lived in Amsterdam ?
- Born and raised here.

519
01:08:03,465 --> 01:08:07,645
I go from the South of France.
I have a house in Saint-Tropez.

520
01:08:08,685 --> 01:08:12,765
If you go up there in the...
Did you hear ? Maybe we are called.

521
01:08:13,705 --> 01:08:16,145
Of course, I invite you to.

522
01:08:17,185 --> 01:08:19,365
Do you think he play?

523
01:08:20,385 --> 01:08:22,205
Who ?
Van der Molen.

524
01:08:23,185 --> 01:08:27,444
Maybe.
I wonder if the lunch time over?

525
01:08:28,384 --> 01:08:30,064
I'll call and ask.

526
01:08:31,004 --> 01:08:34,644
Mr. Richmond,
you came to the guests.

527
01:08:51,783 --> 01:08:56,403
No, at this time
not to do maintenance work.

528
01:08:57,243 --> 01:09:00,763
We respect our guests
the right amount of sleep.

529
01:09:03,203 --> 01:09:06,263
What was that?
- He heard something hakkausta.

530
01:09:07,163 --> 01:09:12,043
Maybe Manson is back in the festivities.
The front desk.

531
01:09:14,903 --> 01:09:17,683
Hello?

532
01:09:21,322 --> 01:09:23,782
If this is a play...

533
01:09:28,462 --> 01:09:30,662
Hello?

534
01:09:35,322 --> 01:09:41,082
Van der Molen is dead?
- He was supposed to meet with you.

535
01:09:41,962 --> 01:09:45,002
We want to talk to you
with your daughter again.

536
01:09:45,962 --> 01:09:49,141
Police found the van der Molenin.
- Discovered ?

537
01:09:50,061 --> 01:09:53,381
Unfortunately, he is dead.
- Lucas is dead?

538
01:09:54,281 --> 01:09:57,641
Who are you?
- Hartman. He was a lawyer.

539
01:09:58,641 --> 01:10:01,301
Melissa saw someone in the fair
Van der Molenin attack.

540
01:10:02,241 --> 01:10:05,801
Maybe. We need to talk
with your daughter. No, she 's asleep.

541
01:10:06,641 --> 01:10:08,781
He has , unfortunately, be awakened.

542
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:42,079
Whether you're a real tough chick !

543
01:10:43,079 --> 01:10:47,039
Give me the gun here,
so anyone not hurt.

544
01:11:03,279 --> 01:11:06,659
He is not here.
- Where is he?

545
01:11:17,338 --> 01:11:20,498
Gym.
- Fire.

546
01:11:56,597 --> 01:11:58,497
What the...

547
01:11:59,457 --> 01:12:05,316
That's Billy Boy Manson !
- Something has happened.

548
01:12:11,136 --> 01:12:14,256
That's all they want.
Hit's a perfect fit.

549
01:13:17,854 --> 01:13:20,694
Do not move!

550
01:13:21,774 --> 01:13:25,674
Put the gun down.
Keep your hands visible.

551
01:13:27,234 --> 01:13:29,733
Okay.

552
01:13:57,092 --> 01:14:01,352
Not to worry.
He is strong and survives.

553
01:14:03,332 --> 01:14:06,672
You saw Van der Molenin
Thus, the last in the afternoon.

554
01:14:07,632 --> 01:14:12,412
Office.
This is terrible. I can not believe this.

555
01:14:17,432 --> 01:14:21,372
If you need anything ,
applies for me.

556
01:14:23,331 --> 01:14:28,131
How's he doing , Walter ?
- In case of unconsciousness. But he survives.

557
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:33,631
Good to hear.
Who would want to kill your daughter ?

558
01:14:34,571 --> 01:14:39,091
Maybe it's that killed Van der Molenin.
Melissa was a witness.

559
01:14:40,131 --> 01:14:44,951
What is this world coming to?
Determine whether the attacker more information ?

560
01:14:45,911 --> 01:14:49,911
Will look into it.
We would have more questions.

561
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:56,450
Now? It can wait.
Demonstrate tact.

562
01:14:57,410 --> 01:14:58,870
Not now.

563
01:14:59,830 --> 01:15:02,570
Perhaps it is better to
wait until tomorrow.

564
01:15:05,570 --> 01:15:08,150
Can I do something ?

565
01:15:09,050 --> 01:15:11,910
You've been a great help.
You, too, experienced the loss.

566
01:15:12,870 --> 01:15:18,489
Do not worry, I'll be fine.
Ajanko you to the hotel?

567
01:15:19,489 --> 01:15:21,329
We have arranged
room here.

568
01:15:22,329 --> 01:15:26,529
Oh, great. Now is not the time
talk about work , but...

569
01:15:27,449 --> 01:15:29,589
Right now, I just think Melissa.

570
01:15:30,849 --> 01:15:33,869
I understand.

571
01:15:34,789 --> 01:15:38,769
I'd better get going.
Let's talk about tomorrow.

572
01:15:39,769 --> 01:15:43,769
Call on earth...
Thank you.

573
01:15:44,809 --> 01:15:47,308
Come with me.

574
01:15:57,728 --> 01:16:02,508
His secretary found them.
- Let's see what Richmond said.

575
01:16:03,508 --> 01:16:07,548
He was shocked. hopefully
This allowed him to convince.

576
01:16:08,988 --> 01:16:13,228
Are these reports true ?
- Original.

577
01:16:14,227 --> 01:16:19,127
How could he get away with faith ?
These do not resemble each other at all.

578
01:16:20,147 --> 01:16:25,267
What if I signed ?
Hartman would have been a big bonus.

579
01:16:26,227 --> 01:16:28,347
Did he kill lawyer
papers due ?

580
01:16:29,147 --> 01:16:32,907
The results show that drugs
is fatal side effects.

581
01:16:33,927 --> 01:16:36,827
Hartman wanted to keep them secret.
- He falsified them.

582
01:16:37,647 --> 01:16:41,367
Van der Molen was found out ,
and did not want to hide it.

583
01:16:42,366 --> 01:16:48,046
He came to tell me.
- But Hartman got to him first.

584
01:16:49,006 --> 01:16:51,846
Who chased Melissa ?
Bruno Decker.

585
01:16:52,766 --> 01:16:55,226
would kill his mother
a packet of cigarettes.

586
01:16:56,226 --> 01:17:00,806
Decker recently played for Hartman.
Hartman is the culprit.

587
01:17:01,706 --> 01:17:03,426
Since you arrest him?

588
01:17:04,426 --> 01:17:08,266
Your daughter is the only witness.
He recognizes the man?

589
01:17:09,325 --> 01:17:10,905
Thus, the evidence does not suffice.
- Not.

590
01:17:11,985 --> 01:17:16,145
But I know a way how they can
get caught. If you just agree.

591
01:17:34,325 --> 01:17:36,904
Hey.
- I'll meet you in the morning.

592
01:17:42,544 --> 01:17:45,964
Melissa can not again
be imperiled.

593
01:17:46,784 --> 01:17:51,224
The situation is completely under control.
- This is your fault.

594
01:17:52,184 --> 01:17:53,904
That was unfair.

595
01:17:54,764 --> 01:17:58,404
Nothing will happen to your daughter.
Trust us.

596
01:17:59,344 --> 01:18:02,404
We're almost in position.
Gives son of a bitch to come.

597
01:18:03,344 --> 01:18:05,403
He will come.

598
01:18:25,263 --> 01:18:27,783
Good evening, Doctor.

599
01:18:31,723 --> 01:18:34,482
Mike Larry.
- Larry here.

600
01:18:35,322 --> 01:18:37,762
How's it going ?
- We are ready to go.

601
01:18:38,682 --> 01:18:42,682
We'll be downstairs. The second
the hospital is 10 minutes away.

602
01:19:08,541 --> 01:19:11,281
Are we ready ?

603
01:19:12,721 --> 01:19:15,221
See you later.

604
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:32,340
Will everyone else, Doctor?

605
01:20:02,899 --> 01:20:06,699
What the...
- Hartman took an ambulance.

606
01:20:07,639 --> 01:20:09,619
Melissa...
- All of the units !

607
01:20:16,039 --> 01:20:18,099
What are you doing ?

608
01:20:41,638 --> 01:20:44,898
He drives towards the south of the Blauwbrug.

609
01:21:05,477 --> 01:21:07,677
He can not escape.

610
01:21:08,637 --> 01:21:11,157
I knew that this would happen.

611
01:21:56,455 --> 01:21:59,715
He is the Vondelpark
and drive to the east.

612
01:22:24,054 --> 01:22:26,414
Can you hear me , Hartman ?

613
01:22:27,454 --> 01:22:30,394
Surrender.
You do not get anywhere.

614
01:22:38,854 --> 01:22:42,833
We know that you are hearing.
Is this the right frequency?

615
01:22:43,813 --> 01:22:46,293
It is for sure.
- It's over.

616
01:22:47,273 --> 01:22:50,853
Stop the car and come out.
- I will show you.

617
01:23:00,673 --> 01:23:04,893
There they are.
- Get him a bitch!

618
01:23:31,172 --> 01:23:33,892
Is everything all right ?
- There he is.

619
01:23:36,871 --> 01:23:40,571
Where are you going ?
- Stay in the car !

620
01:24:27,610 --> 01:24:29,890
Where is Walter ?

621
01:26:00,186 --> 01:26:02,026
Thanks !

622
01:26:34,805 --> 01:26:37,185
Melissa !

623
01:26:42,785 --> 01:26:46,705
Need help ?
- I do not. My daughter !

624
01:26:48,025 --> 01:26:50,664
Walter !

625
01:26:51,844 --> 01:26:54,664
Melissa !

626
01:26:57,044 --> 01:26:59,384
What the...

627
01:27:00,264 --> 01:27:01,744
Trying again are you ?

628
01:27:03,664 --> 01:27:07,764
This can not be due to puheistasi.

629
01:27:31,803 --> 01:27:36,263
Do you like it ?
Can I really boat ?

630
01:27:37,083 --> 01:27:40,303
Be offended if you say no.
Thank you.

631
01:27:42,843 --> 01:27:46,542
What do you think of Amsterdam
during the day ?

632
01:27:51,882 --> 01:27:56,702
I hope that rehabilitation is successful.
- He seems dedicated family.

633
01:27:57,522 --> 01:27:59,762
I do not think he will sell this boat
in order to buy drugs ?

634
01:28:00,762 --> 01:28:03,022
You are always so pessimistic.

635
01:28:03,962 --> 01:28:07,022
So go out tomorrow to Rome?
Yes, it is supposed to.

636
01:28:08,162 --> 01:28:14,201
Crime figures in Rome
are the highest in Europe.

637
01:28:15,101 --> 01:28:16,961
Even worse than Amsterdam.

638
01:28:25,601 --> 01:28:29,741
What does that mean ?
New round of Amsterdam around.

639
01:28:31,741 --> 01:28:33,801
After all, brings the beginning.

640
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:48,800
Does the idea of ??a
Amsterdam changed?

641
01:28:49,860 --> 01:28:53,260
Subject to change.
The city is beautiful.

642
01:28:54,180 --> 01:28:57,020
Melissa seems to thrive here.

643
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:02,160
Just out of curiosity just how much would 
this boat fetch me on the open market, sir?

644
01:29:03,305 --> 01:29:09,356
