00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,678
- Afternoon, Dr Sparrow.
- Afternoon, Charlie.

3
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,957
- Hello, Sparrow.
- Afternoon, Bingham.

4
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,432
Busy afternoon.
I<i>'</i>ve got two septic fingers,

5
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,795
a lipoma and four warts already.

6
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,236
- Congratulations.
- It<i>'</i>s great experience.

7
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,630
I say, you don<i>'</i>t mind
my mentioning it, do you?

8
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,032
But that discussion we had yesterday
about the treatment of herpes,

9
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,396
you were wrong, you know.
I looked it up.

10
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,869
Thank you.

11
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,315
Just thought I<i>'</i>d tell you.

12
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,393
I say, old boy, about that
Senior House Surgeon<i>'</i>s job.

13
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,833
Yes?

14
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,957
- It<i>'</i>s between you and me, you know.
- Yes, I know.

15
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,918
Well, may the best man win
and all that.

16
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,150
That<i>'</i>s right.

17
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,437
- Good afternoon, Nurse.
- Hello, Dr Bingham.

18
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,398
- Good afternoon, Dr Sparrow.
- Good afternoon.

19
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,516
Did you enjoy the dance last night?

20
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,830
- Yes. Did you?
- Mmm. Parts of it.

21
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,390
We found your pipe down a settee.
I<i>'</i>ve kept it for you.

22
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,758
Good girl. I<i>'</i>m lost without it.
Well, the mixture as before, eh?

23
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,790
(Horn honks)

24
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,071
Get your wretched garbage van
out of the way, man!

25
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,233
Hey! You there!
You can<i>'</i>t park that thing here.

26
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,154
- Why not? Says "car park".
- This place is reserved for me.

27
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,676
- Has been for 20 years.
- There<i>'</i>s room beside it.

28
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,228
I don<i>'</i>t want garbage on my coachwork.

29
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,276
Yes, you<i>'</i>ve got a point there.

30
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,676
0K, you can move it.

31
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,596
Where shall I go, Lancelot?

32
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,036
0ver there, Charles.
I<i>'</i>ll be with you soon to fix you up.

33
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,473
Thank you.

34
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,949
That fractured radius
needs re-plastering tomorrow.

35
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,352
0h, I shan<i>'</i>t be here, Doctor.
I<i>'</i>m on night duty in the wards.

36
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,795
0h, that is a pity.

37
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,474
- That<i>'</i>s you done.
- Thank you, Doctor.

38
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,315
Now, you know what to do next time
you lean out of the window?

39
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,951
- What<i>'</i>s that, Doc?
- 0pen it first. 0ff you go.

40
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,918
- What ward have they moved you to?
- Charity.

41
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,150
Visitors welcome at supper time?

42
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:21,279
- A doctor<i>'</i>s got to do his rounds.
- He certainly has.

43
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,430
Next, please.

44
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,793
Good afternoon.
What<i>'</i>s wrong with you?

45
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,759
0ne of your blokes nabbed me
in the street. Told me to come.

46
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,355
Really? Yeah, looks like a cyst.

47
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,238
Whatever it is,
it<i>'</i>s been there a long time.

48
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,235
Has it? Yes, they can be nasty.
We<i>'</i>d better cut it out, I think.

49
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,630
Here. Sit down.
Sebaceous cyst removal, Nurse.

50
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,678
- I say, Sparrow. That<i>'</i>s my cyst.
- 0h, is it?

51
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,990
I<i>'</i>ve been looking forward to that.

52
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,753
Never mind. There are plenty more.

53
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,559
That<i>'</i>s not the point.
This is my patient.

54
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,677
It<i>'</i>s not ethical pinching
people<i>'</i>s patients.

55
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,197
It<i>'</i>s not ethical to prowl around
garbage cans touting for custom.

56
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,875
- I don<i>'</i>t like your tone.
- Tell the General Medical Council.

57
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,192
- Well, really, I must say...
- I don<i>'</i>t mind who has the cyst

58
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,317
but I<i>'</i>ve got to get back
to the dustbins at once.

59
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,552
I<i>'</i>m handing you to Dr Bingham.
Apparently, he spotted you first.

60
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,756
Prepare for the excision, Nurse.

61
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,150
And see that your ethics
are sterilised, as well.

62
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,071
(Screaming in pain)

63
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,670
- Hey, we take our turn, you know.
- What? 0h, er...

64
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,594
- We<i>'</i>ve been waiting half an hour.
- Who does he think he is?

65
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,797
- 0h, forgive me. I was told...
- Wait your turn.

66
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,997
That<i>'</i>s enough.
I saw you sneaking down the row.

67
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,868
You won<i>'</i>t bleed to death with that.
Where<i>'</i>s your treatment card?

68
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,315
Card? I<i>'</i>m sorry but what card?

69
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,312
There<i>'</i>s a board inside the door.
Can<i>'</i>t you read?

70
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,675
- I can explain...
- No explanations, pop.

71
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,399
- Get home and get your card.
- What<i>'</i>s going on?

72
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,596
- Are you in trouble, Charles?
- Yes.

73
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,117
This young man has been behaving
extremely rudely. He called me "pop".

74
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,156
- Who are you?
- Sparrow, sir.

75
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,994
Let me introduce you.
Dr Sparrow, Sir Charles Hopcroft,

76
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,071
a governor of this hospital.

77
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,596
Sir Charles cut his finger
at luncheon. I am suturing it.

78
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,478
I<i>'</i>m terribly sorry, sir.
I didn<i>'</i>t realise.

79
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,439
Aren<i>'</i>t you in the running
for Senior House Surgeon?

80
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,476
Yes, sir.

81
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,036
What a good thing
that I have some say in this matter.

82
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,398
The impertinence! Never been called
"pop" in my life before.

83
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,118
Too bad, old man.

84
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,590
I<i>'</i>m afraid that<i>'</i>s
going to set you back quite a bit.

85
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,278
(Laughter)

86
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,396
- Sparrow.
- Good evening, Doctor.

87
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,436
- Evening, Padre.
- Guinness?

88
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,909
- Yeah. What are you drinking?
- Pop.

89
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,675
- Don<i>'</i>t mention pop to me again.
- It steadies the nerves.

90
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,514
- Final exams tomorrow.
- You<i>'</i>ll pass this time, Mr Benskin.

91
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,831
It<i>'</i>ll be grand
to have you both as doctors.

92
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,195
I<i>'</i>m filled with quiet confidence.

93
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,113
I<i>'</i>m ambitious.
I want to be a surgeon, too.

94
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,670
- Well, I<i>'</i>m not getting very far.
- You<i>'</i>re depressed.

95
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,230
You want an exquisite creature
to smooth your brow.

96
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,551
- Where<i>'</i>s Joy?
- I haven<i>'</i>t seen her since Tuesday.

97
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,632
Anyway, she needs somebody
to smooth her own brow.

98
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,359
- What<i>'</i>s the matter?
- All this swotting.

99
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,558
Why she suddenly wants
to be a doctor, heaven alone knows.

100
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,200
- Hello.
- Joy, my love.

101
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,794
Come and sit down. Simon<i>'</i>s depressed.

102
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,871
Are you? So am I.

103
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,554
- Smooth his brow.
- Can it be mutual?

104
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,189
What did I tell you?
You need a large gin and tonic.

105
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,032
Thanks.

106
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,156
What<i>'</i>s he so depressed about?

107
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,196
Move over.

108
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,149
- He feels he<i>'</i>s not getting along.
- He<i>'</i>s not the only one.

109
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,313
- That<i>'</i>ll be four and four.
- Trust me till Friday?

110
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,151
- 0ne large gin and tonic.
- Thanks.

111
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,196
You should relax, Joy.

112
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,590
It<i>'</i>s trying to relax
that makes me so jittery. Cheers.

113
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,310
I<i>'</i>ll tell you what. We<i>'</i>ll go back
to your place and I<i>'</i>ll treat you.

114
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,356
I<i>'</i>ve been reading it up.

115
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,035
- (Girl) Excuse me.
- (Growls lecherously)

116
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,153
Now, don<i>'</i>t be frightened.
I<i>'</i>m just going to put you to sleep

117
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,674
and whisper some encouraging words.

118
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,638
When you wake,
you<i>'</i>ll be bursting with confidence.

119
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,154
If that<i>'</i>s all you whisper.
I know you.

120
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,233
0oh! 0oh! Disgusting! (Chuckles)

121
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,197
Now, look at me.

122
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,918
(Dog barking)

123
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,878
Look, I must have absolute quiet.

124
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,396
Go on. Go home. Go home. Go on.

125
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,791
Now, look into my eyes...

126
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,236
both eyes... and concentrate.

127
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,073
Your left leg is feeling very heavy.

128
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,628
Your right leg is feeling very heavy.

129
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,996
- Now, concentrate.
- (Dog barks)

130
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,799
- Shut up!
- Give him a biscuit, Simon.

131
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,836
In the cupboard.

132
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,079
Joy, you<i>'</i>ve got to concentrate.
Cooperate.

133
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,312
Now you<i>'</i>re feeling very sleepy.
You<i>'</i>re going to sleep.

134
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,234
- (Dog whining)
- Here you are.

135
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,314
You<i>'</i>re going to sleep.
Relax... Relax...

136
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,470
Just a minute.

137
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,393
- Sorry.
- Joy, you<i>'</i>re just not cooperating.

138
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,917
- I-I<i>'</i>m awfully sorry, Tony.
- Now. You<i>'</i>re feeling sleepy.

139
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,753
You<i>'</i>re going to sleep.
Now, relax...

140
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,599
Relax...

141
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,478
You<i>'</i>re going to sleep.

142
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,471
(Joy) Simon!

143
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,514
Look!

144
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,397
Hey, Tony?

145
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,311
Ton...?

146
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,359
Come on, wake up.
You<i>'</i>ve got an exam tomorrow.

147
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,512
Come on. 0h, give it here.

148
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,953
(Shrieks)

149
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,751
Hello, you gorgeous creature. Hello.

150
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,115
Muffin, my dear fellow.

151
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,317
- Hello, you two.
- (Tony) Hello, Joy.

152
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,029
Heaven knows what you look like.
What have you done?

153
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,076
- You mean the glasses?
- Mmm.

154
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,597
Well, I think they like girls
to look more serious, intellectual.

155
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,478
I think it gives you
more chance of passing.

156
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,836
- But you don<i>'</i>t wear glasses.
- But they<i>'</i>re plain glass.

157
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,433
Aren<i>'</i>t they effective?

158
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,637
- If you want to look like a frog.
- Honestly, Simon!

159
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,109
Come on. 0ff to the chopping block.

160
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,475
- I<i>'</i>ll hold my thumbs.
- (Joy) Thanks.

161
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,473
That, sir, was removed
post-mortem from a man of 70.

162
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,869
What do you find of interest in it?

163
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,756
- It<i>'</i>s a brain, sir.
- It is indeed. Well?

164
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,637
I notice only
the usual senile changes, sir.

165
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,678
You say these changes
are not unusual?

166
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,116
No, sir. After all,
the patient was senile.

167
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,158
Dash it, he was 70,
practically ga-ga.

168
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,392
Hmm...
I shall be 76 myself next birthday.

169
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,155
Thank you for reminding me
that I<i>'</i>m well past my job.

170
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,276
- Good morning, sir.
- Sir, I...

171
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,316
Good morning.

172
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,199
- Good morning.
- 0h!

173
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,510
- (Knock)
- Come in.

174
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,398
- 0h, a female.
- Yes.

175
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,519
Well, you appear more intelligent
than most of them, I must say.

176
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,797
Doctoring and lipstick
don<i>'</i>t mix together.

177
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,831
Now, come here and tell me
what you can see there.

178
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,475
Well? Well?

179
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,432
Hmm? Hmm?

180
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,239
- Blood dyscrasia?
- That<i>'</i>s right.

181
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,276
Now, come along. Come over here.

182
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,715
Come on.

183
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,475
I<i>'</i>ve very little time, girl. Come on.

184
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,910
- Yes, sir.
- 0h, get my glasses from the table.

185
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,270
- Come along. We haven<i>'</i>t got all day.
- Yes, sir.

186
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,394
Could I have my glasses, please?

187
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,040
0h! 0h, I<i>'</i>m so sorry.

188
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,990
Appearances can be very deceptive,
can<i>'</i>t they?

189
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,919
Good morning.
Send in the next student.

190
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,991
What are you worried about?
It<i>'</i>s a piece of cake.

191
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,036
(Sir Lancelot) Come!

192
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,436
Good morning, sir.
I don<i>'</i>t want any inane remarks.

193
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,273
I<i>'</i>ve got a touch of the gout
this morning.

194
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,352
- I<i>'</i>ve seen you before, haven<i>'</i>t I?
- Yes, sir.

195
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,355
- A good doctor never forgets a face.
- That isn<i>'</i>t limited to faces, sir.

196
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,590
What would you do
if you found me flat on the floor?

197
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,353
- Send for a doctor, sir.
- You are a doctor, man!

198
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,113
Sorry, sir. That<i>'</i>s quite right.

199
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,033
Erm... Are you snoring, sir?

200
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,511
- I<i>'</i>m breathing heavily.
- Then, I<i>'</i>d tiptoe out again.

201
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,639
- People don<i>'</i>t sleep on the floor.
- After a strenuous evening...

202
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,950
Never mind that. I<i>'</i>m not asleep.

203
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,597
- Are you dead, sir?
- I don<i>'</i>t know, I<i>'</i>m asking you!

204
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,389
- 0h.
- You wouldn<i>'</i>t ring an undertaker?

205
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,917
No, of course not, sir.
I<i>'</i>d examine you. Feel your heart.

206
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,709
- I<i>'</i>m lying on my stomach.
- Are you indeed, sir?

207
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,876
Quite a problem.

208
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,714
- Feel your pulse?
- My pulse is fine

209
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,870
and I<i>'</i>ve got no broken bones.

210
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,748
I am relieved, sir. Then,
I would cover you with a blanket

211
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,796
and send for an ambulance.

212
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,793
And leave me on this cold floor
with my backside full of splinters,

213
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,394
covered with a rug
the cat<i>'</i>s had kittens on?

214
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,314
I should ruddy well think so!
You<i>'</i>d pick me up, wouldn<i>'</i>t you?

215
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,595
We<i>'</i>d both end up on the floor, sir.

216
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,116
Try and pick me up. They teach you
that in the Boy Scouts.

217
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,079
This isn<i>'</i>t the type of picking up
I<i>'</i>m good at. I wasn<i>'</i>t in the Scouts.

218
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,515
Well, have a go. See what you can do.

219
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,158
Yes, sir.

220
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,234
(Tony groans)

221
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,470
Come on, man. Get on with it.

222
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,755
- 0h!
- Sorry, sir.

223
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,838
Ah!

224
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,992
What<i>'</i>s happened?
Has Sir Lancelot passed out?

225
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,071
Sir Lancelot has not passed out.

226
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,152
And neither, indeed,
will you, young man.

227
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,956
0h, forget it.
Everyone fails an exam sometime.

228
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,713
Put that egg away
and we<i>'</i>ll go have a meal.

229
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,552
I<i>'</i>ve got to work.

230
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,518
- But you can<i>'</i>t work every evening.
- I must.

231
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,230
- You<i>'</i>re not very sociable, Joy.
- I<i>'</i>m sorry. This is important to me.

232
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,517
- Surely you can understand that?
- Yes, I do, but...

233
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,912
- Well, it<i>'</i>s dull for your chums.
- I can<i>'</i>t help it.

234
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,798
Let<i>'</i>s catch the second house
at the Palladium.

235
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,269
I<i>'</i>ve got to work, I tell you. You go.

236
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,239
0r drop in on someone
who<i>'</i>s got more time to be sociable.

237
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,834
All right. I will.

238
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,078
0h!

239
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,199
- Good evening, Nurse Macpherson.
- Good evening, Doctor.

240
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,636
I took the liberty of bringing you
some eggs and bacon.

241
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,676
0oh! That sounds good.

242
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,149
- How are the patients?
- All tucked up.

243
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,231
- And how are you?
- Lonely.

244
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,198
That<i>'</i>s what I thought.
That<i>'</i>s why I came.

245
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,748
It<i>'</i>s a very lonely job
being night nurse.

246
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,230
- What<i>'</i>s this?
- Charlie Bingham<i>'</i>s. He looked in.

247
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,276
0h, he did, did he?

248
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,239
What can you see in a drip like
Charlie Bingham? What<i>'</i>s he got?

249
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,710
Charlie<i>'</i>s all right.
He takes me to the Corner House.

250
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,236
- The Corner House!
- That<i>'</i>s more than some doctors do.

251
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,517
I was wondering
if you<i>'</i>d like dinner in the country

252
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,556
when you<i>'</i>ve got a night off?

253
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,837
I<i>'</i>ve been told of a place
where the food is excellent.

254
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,912
How do we go? By bus?
Hand me another egg.

255
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,356
- By bus! By car.
- 0h, you run a car, do you?

256
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,228
- Yes, of course.
- Well, thanks. Could be great fun.

257
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,236
Pull out the choke.

258
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,311
(Horn sounds)

259
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,275
That was the horn, Nan, dear.
The choke<i>'</i>s on the right.

260
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,712
(Engine starts)

261
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,836
Move over.

262
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,752
0h!

263
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,870
Are you wet?

264
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,995
Just outside.
I could do with a drink.

265
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,595
Well, come on, let<i>'</i>s go!
What are you waiting for?

266
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,359
It<i>'</i>s still pouring down.
It<i>'</i>ll be murder getting home.

267
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,235
Nan, what would your reaction be
to, er... making a night of it?

268
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:04,549
We could, er... have a drink and then
some food, then another drink.

269
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,473
- I<i>'</i>m famished.
- That<i>'</i>s what I mean.

270
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:13,112
If we go on to this place, it might
make us late driving back to London.

271
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,955
I<i>'</i>m sure they could put us up for the
night, if it<i>'</i>s all right with you.

272
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,555
Well, if the food<i>'</i>s
as good as you say, let<i>'</i>s go.

273
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,679
I expect I can borrow
a toothbrush from someone.

274
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,512
Yes.

275
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,272
Cosy place.

276
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,476
Well, we are in the country.

277
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,518
We seem to be in a game reserve.

278
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,352
Yes.

279
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,993
Does this remind you
of the Marie Celeste?

280
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,913
Well, it<i>'</i>s a sleepy part
of the world. 0h, Nan...

281
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,993
Yes?

282
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,594
- We want accommodation, please.
- Yes.

283
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,797
- Just for tonight. You have some?
- Yes.

284
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,394
- Will you sign the book, please?
- Yes.

285
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,710
What name is it?

286
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,358
Phillimore.

287
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,592
(Resounding clang)

288
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,510
Thank you.

289
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,470
Which of you is Sparrow?

290
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,835
- What?
- You<i>'</i>ve signed "Sparrow".

291
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,230
0h, yes. That<i>'</i>s me, of course.

292
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,279
This is Miss Phillimore.
We shall require two rooms.

293
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,669
I should hope so.

294
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,755
Will the lady please sign the book?

295
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,075
Thank you.

296
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,280
We<i>'</i>re going up north to our
uncle<i>'</i>s funeral. We<i>'</i>re cousins.

297
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,511
He was in the brass business.
Charming old fellow.

298
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,352
Ernest?

299
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,670
The luggage.

300
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,839
The lady will be in No. 3
and the gentleman in No. 92.

301
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,277
Miss Phillimore and I are cousins.

302
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,035
We going up to an uncle<i>'</i>s funeral...
in the North.

303
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,669
He was in the brass business.

304
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,509
- Charming old fellow.
- 92<i>'</i>s up here.

305
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,188
Thank you.
I<i>'</i>ll ring if I want anything.

306
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,511
Ring your heart out. The bell<i>'</i>s bust.

307
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,112
(Sniffs)

308
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,156
(Sneezes and bed spring breaks)

309
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,157
0h, Lord!

310
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,034
Your thumb! Do you mind?

311
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,836
Well, now, what<i>'</i>s it to be?

312
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,956
(Coughs)

313
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,510
Erm... Potage Du Barry, I suppose.

314
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,716
0h, I wouldn<i>'</i>t have any of that.

315
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,588
All right. Steamed plaice,
pommes vapeurs and cabbage.

316
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,955
Well, I wouldn<i>'</i>t tell everybody

317
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,510
but even the cats downstairs
are refusing the fish.

318
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,200
The mutton, then.
And two more whiskies.

319
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,239
Right. I see from the register
that you<i>'</i>re from London.

320
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,756
- What business would you be in now?
- I<i>'</i>m a doctor.

321
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,628
0h, are you now, Doctor?
Well, that<i>'</i>s very interesting.

322
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,473
I<i>'</i>m having trouble
with me feet lately.

323
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,551
I think the arches have dropped...

324
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:20,111
- We<i>'</i>d like some food now.
- And some drink.

325
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,589
OK.

326
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:27,071
Er, did I hear you<i>'</i>re a medical man,
sir? My name<i>'</i>s Major Porter.

327
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,755
May I introduce myself
to your good self and your lady wife?

328
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,116
- I<i>'</i>m a lady, but no wife.
- No, we<i>'</i>re cousins.

329
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,590
We have an uncle
that<i>'</i>s having a funeral tomorrow.

330
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,353
- He was in the brass business.
- 0h!

331
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,830
Doctor,
I<i>'</i>m sure my case would interest you.

332
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,674
Now, at the age of five,
I was given six months to live.

333
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,832
Six months! Look at that!

334
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,032
(Coughs)

335
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,350
(Sighs)

336
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,918
Anything I can do, Doctor Sparrow?

337
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,991
N-No.

338
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:42,238
- I was looking for the bathroom.
- There<i>'</i>s one on your floor.

339
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,595
0h, is there? I didn<i>'</i>t notice.

340
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:49,390
It<i>'</i>s marked "bath" in large letters.
0pposite your room.

341
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,232
Thank you.

342
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,431
Thanks ever so much.
Done me a lot of good.

343
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,590
You should see a doctor yourself.

344
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:20,559
Yes, I<i>'</i>m going to get some
of my own medicine. Rum and milk.

345
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,154
- Good night, Mrs Law.
- Bye-bye, duck.

346
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,437
- Next, please.
- Sir Lancelot left this for you,

347
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,590
and may I say how sorry I am?

348
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,036
But it always was best man win
and all that.

349
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:36,318
- What are you talking about?
- I<i>'</i>m the new Senior House Surgeon.

350
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,391
We<i>'</i>re just off to celebrate.

351
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,678
Never mind. You<i>'</i>ll do all right
in general practice. Goodbye.

352
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:47,151
Good night, Dr Sparrow.
Sorry you caught such a nasty cold.

353
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,796
What<i>'</i>s the matter?

354
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,632
This.

355
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:01,592
"Dr Sparrow has been Casualty
House Surgeon for three months,

356
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:06,515
"in which time he has performed
his duties to his own satisfaction.

357
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,716
"Signed, Lancelot Spratt."

358
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,756
0h, dear.

359
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,195
Has that pimple Bingham got the job?

360
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,352
- Yeah.
- The mean old so-and-so.

361
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,635
- I<i>'</i>ll get us a drink.
- Thank you.

362
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,679
- Simon?
- (Nasally) Hmm? 0h, rum and milk.

363
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,399
(Mocking) Rum and milk.

364
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,194
I<i>'</i>m awfully sorry about this, Simon.

365
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,874
Fancy missing a certainty like that.

366
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,474
If you weren<i>'</i>t so successful
in that field,

367
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,516
you wouldn<i>'</i>t be in your position.

368
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,591
0f course,
Macpherson<i>'</i>s an awfully sweet girl,

369
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,114
- but she<i>'</i>s really not your type.
- No.

370
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,839
- A bit predatory?
- Mmm.

371
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,434
Gin and tonic, Scotch,
and rum and milk.

372
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,476
Simon, listen.

373
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:55,236
"Positions open. Suitable
for recently qualified practitioner.

374
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:00,792
"Medical officer in luxury liner.
Salary £2,000 per annum. In dollars."

375
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,316
I<i>'</i>ve come about the advertisements
in the Medical Journal.

376
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,836
I<i>'</i>ll take the millionaire if I can.
0therwise, the cruise.

377
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,037
Alas, Doctor,
both vacancies are filled.

378
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,112
- They only came out yesterday.
- The rush was great.

379
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,397
However, we have others.
You wish to go abroad?

380
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,711
- I don<i>'</i>t mind, if there<i>'</i>s sun.
- I have just the place -

381
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,916
the Acropolis 0il Company in Iraq.

382
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,278
A Greek concern, but respectable.
The tour of duty is five years.

383
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,396
I don<i>'</i>t want as much sun as that.

384
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,119
Are you a man of faith, Doctor?
You look it.

385
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,191
A medical missionary in Siam.

386
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:39,115
The remuneration is not very high
but one gains one<i>'</i>s reward in heaven.

387
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,714
I prefer to gain mine
a little earlier.

388
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:46,316
Have you any ordinary practices?
General practice would be useful.

389
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,188
0f course. I thought you wished to
leave the country for some reason.

390
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,397
- No.
- Well, we have many practices.

391
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,268
Now, here<i>'</i>s just the thing.
Semi-rural. In the Midlands.

392
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,591
Assistant to Dr Hatchet.
I know him personally.

393
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:04,912
A fine clinician. You<i>'</i>ll learn a lot.
All found, ten guineas a week.

394
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,036
Not to be sneezed at, eh, Doctor?

395
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,510
Lt<i>'</i>ll be gone by lunchtime,
I guarantee.

396
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,114
- All right. I<i>'</i>ll take it.
- Very wise.

397
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,272
I<i>'</i>ll give you the details.
Can you sign this?

398
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,396
It<i>'</i>s just the usual commission.

399
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,358
33% of your salary
for the first year

400
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,671
and five pounds for consultation...
in cash.

401
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:29,356
We don<i>'</i>t like to take it but
the overheads, you know, Doctor...

402
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,113
(Whistle sounds)

403
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,756
Er, Dr Hatchet? I<i>'</i>m Dr Sparrow.

404
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:13,755
Fancy that. I said to the Doctor
this morning, "He ain<i>'</i>t coming."

405
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,674
He, er... ain<i>'</i>t in yet
but I<i>'</i>ll show you your room.

406
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,669
- You ain<i>'</i>t half young.
- I<i>'</i>m not exactly in the cradle.

407
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,115
The Doctor<i>'</i>s had some
real old fogies.

408
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,875
There was Dr Christmas.
He must have been about 90.

409
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,670
There was Dr 0<i>'</i>Higgins, Dr 0<i>'</i>Rourke,
Dr 0<i>'</i>Toole... Grandpas, they were.

410
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,914
Before that, there was Dr Solomons,
Dr Assiz, Dr Wu...

411
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,436
- Was he Chinese?
- (Chuckling) So he said.

412
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,954
You<i>'</i>ve had rather a lot
of assistants.

413
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,554
Hundreds and hundreds of them.

414
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,519
It<i>'</i>s a bit chilly, this weather,
but you can make it comfy.

415
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,555
It<i>'</i>s a home from home, I assure you.

416
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,993
(Bangs)

417
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,072
It<i>'</i>s a bit hard,
but you get used to it.

418
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,993
You get a nice fug
if you keep the window shut.

419
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,152
Dr Wu used to burn incense
and things.

420
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,198
- You won<i>'</i>t be doing that, will you?
- Not often.

421
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,909
The light<i>'</i>s switched off at 11.
You can bathe on Saturday.

422
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,753
- Doctor<i>'</i>s orders.
- Seems a bit mean.

423
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,400
He does hold back a bit,
I must say.

424
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,436
Don<i>'</i>t agree with it myself.

425
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:35,310
Yes, well, I<i>'</i>m, er...
I<i>'</i>m delighted to welcome you, Doctor.

426
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,915
It<i>'</i>s remarkably warm
for this time of year, is it not?

427
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,913
- Well, it<i>'</i>s a bit cold after London.
- Really?

428
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,594
I always wear wool next to the skin.

429
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:50,196
It<i>'</i>s much healthier than breathing
fumes of combustible gasses.

430
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,798
- Is that your car outside?
- Yes.

431
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,873
0h. I do my nearer visits
on a bicycle,

432
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,916
for the fresh air, you know.

433
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:06,595
We could make an arrangement
by which you had part use of it.

434
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:10,355
I<i>'</i>d make the deduction
from your salary, of course.

435
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,750
0h, now, you<i>'</i>ve met my wife,
haven<i>'</i>t you?

436
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,037
- Your wife?!
- Shall we sit down?

437
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,789
Pour the Doctor his tea, my dear.

438
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,192
You do like it weak, don<i>'</i>t you?
Too much tannin is not good.

439
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,556
- Thank you.
- Take a sardine.

440
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,677
I see there
are exactly one and one third each.

441
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,035
It<i>'</i>s healthier not to be overloaded

442
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,032
with a heavy meal last thing,
don<i>'</i>t you agree?

443
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,076
Yes, I suppose so.

444
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,754
Yes. Well, we<i>'</i>ll discuss your duties

445
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,435
and I<i>'</i>ll show you
the drug cupboard after supper.

446
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,032
Shall we say grace, Jasmine, my dear?

447
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:02,798
Perhaps you didn<i>'</i>t know
I was married, Dr Sparrow.

448
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,996
- No, I didn<i>'</i>t.
- 0h, yes.

449
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:09,312
Yes, my wife
used to be my housekeeper and er...

450
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,789
Very attractive lady, don<i>'</i>t you find?

451
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,314
- Yes, indeed.
- Yes.

452
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,914
Yes. Well, now, your duties...

453
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,437
You<i>'</i>ll take morning and evening
surgery and all night calls.

454
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:26,755
This is the drug cupboard.
And these are the drugs.

455
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,630
And, er... what are all these?

456
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:33,156
Those? They<i>'</i>re samples.
The drug houses send a great many.

457
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,995
They<i>'</i>re useful for private patients.
They<i>'</i>re a little source of income.

458
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,636
You make them pay for these?

459
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,713
Certainly. Patients don<i>'</i>t appreciate
what they don<i>'</i>t pay for.

460
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,916
(Whistles) Good morning.

461
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,992
- (All) Good morning.
- Bit young to be a doctor.

462
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,394
First, please.

463
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:06,274
0h, hello, Doctor. I<i>'</i>m Mrs Wilkins.
How are you this nice, fine morning?

464
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,920
I<i>'</i>m very well.
I hope we find that you are.

465
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,197
- Not so dusty.
- Now, what<i>'</i>s the trouble?

466
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,113
Trouble, Doctor?
There ain<i>'</i>t no trouble.

467
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,079
- I mean, what are you here for?
- To get me medicine, of course.

468
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:23,199
- I see. What sort of medicine?
- The red medicine, Doctor.

469
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,316
- What do you take it for?
- Wind.

470
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:30,758
- 0h, you suffer from wind?
- No. I haven<i>'</i>t had wind for years.

471
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,239
0h.

472
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:37,189
If you don<i>'</i>t mind my suggesting,
as a rule, the Ws are at the back.

473
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:42,957
Yes. Right. Here we are. How long
have you been taking this medicine?

474
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:47,636
- Going on 15 years.
- 15?

475
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,235
Well, I<i>'</i>m afraid I shan<i>'</i>t
be able to give you any more.

476
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,993
What? But I must have me medicine.

477
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,150
You don<i>'</i>t need it, dear.

478
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,391
But I take me medicine regular
three times a day.

479
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:04,759
Control yourself. Doctors must
cut down on unnecessary medicine.

480
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,912
- I want me medicine.
- Well, you can<i>'</i>t have it.

481
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,232
I want me medicine. I<i>'</i>ve got rights.
I pay my National Health.

482
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,118
You<i>'</i>re a thief! That<i>'</i>s what you are.

483
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,156
Now, Mrs Wilkins...

484
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,679
- What<i>'</i>s the matter, ducks?
- He won<i>'</i>t give me me medicine.

485
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,515
0h? All right. I<i>'</i>ll handle this.
You wait outside.

486
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,354
Taking those shillings
from people what can<i>'</i>t afford it.

487
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:37,309
I know what happens to them stamps.
Lining the doctors<i>'</i> pockets.

488
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,755
I want me medicine!

489
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,710
- You<i>'</i>ve upset my wife.
- I<i>'</i>m sorry.

490
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:48,395
I can<i>'</i>t give her more medicine.
It<i>'</i>s against regulations.

491
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:54,157
0h. Well, also in the regulations for
the control and conduct of the NHS,

492
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,596
it says that a patient
what receives inefficient service

493
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,069
can state a case
before the Council,

494
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:05,234
who, if necessary, shall deduct a
fine from the doctor<i>'</i>s remunerations.

495
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,630
- Now, look, Mr Wilkins...
- Take it easy.

496
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:13,669
It<i>'</i>s nothing personal. I<i>'</i>m just
stating regulations. I know them all.

497
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,231
If you don<i>'</i>t leave,
you<i>'</i>ll get a kick up the... coccyx.

498
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,835
- Violence will get you nowhere.
- Next, please.

499
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,550
- Where<i>'</i>s the doctor?
- I am the doctor.

500
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:35,792
- I mean, the real one.
- I assure you, I<i>'</i>m perfectly real.

501
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,997
0h, you<i>'</i>re Dr Hatchet<i>'</i>s new boy,
I suppose.

502
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,992
What were you doing
with poor Mrs Wilkins?

503
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,036
What can I do for you?

504
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:48,033
My Eva<i>'</i>s chest, here. Cough, cough,
cough all night, she does.

505
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:52,716
Really? I<i>'</i>d better examine her.
Will she take off her cardigan?

506
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,234
Do as he says, Eva.

507
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,875
Thank you.

508
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,833
- Now, big breaths, Eva.
- (Lisps) Yeth and I<i>'</i>m only thixteen.

509
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,989
My dear,
I notice you<i>'</i>ve cooked four sausages.

510
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:17,312
I did an extra one for the doctor.
He looked a bit peaky.

511
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,153
- Indeed?
- (Telephone)

512
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,674
The telephone, my dear.

513
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:35,558
It<i>'</i>s surprising the number of doctors
that have sinned, isn<i>'</i>t it?

514
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,710
Sinned?

515
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,950
Committed murder.

516
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,349
There was Neil Cream,

517
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:47,468
Palmer the Poisoner and... Crippen.

518
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:53,556
And for a number of motives -
jealousy among them.

519
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,392
Yes, I suppose so.

520
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,552
I often wonder
how many murderers there must be

521
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,632
who<i>'</i>ve never been detected
in their crimes.

522
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,836
Do you?

523
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,469
Lf, indeed, it is a crime
in some circumstances.

524
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,631
Doctor?

525
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,994
- Doctor?
- Yes? Yes?

526
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,709
There<i>'</i>s a call. Urgent.
I<i>'</i>ve left the message in the hall.

527
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,950
Thanks very much.

528
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,753
It<i>'</i>s all right, Mrs Hatchet.
I can manage.

529
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,712
Morning, Doctor.
I<i>'</i>ve been waiting for you.

530
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,872
- I hope this isn<i>'</i>t a joke.
- I never play jokes.

531
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,269
Some say
I<i>'</i>ve got no sense of humour.

532
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,316
- Are you ill?
- No, never ill.

533
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,631
You<i>'</i>ll never have to treat me.
It<i>'</i>s the wife.

534
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,029
- What<i>'</i>s the matter?
- She<i>'</i>s dying.

535
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,350
Let<i>'</i>s have a look at her.

536
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:22,878
Well, it<i>'</i>s very inconsiderate of him
to insist on my coming now.

537
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,872
I<i>'</i>m sure he could wait.
I<i>'</i>ve a good mind not to go.

538
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,349
You<i>'</i>d better. It<i>'</i>s the bank manager.

539
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,115
Yes, though what one keeps
an assistant for, I don<i>'</i>t know.

540
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,838
No, dear.

541
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,833
Yes. Well, go back to sleep.
I shall be away some time, I fear.

542
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,876
What a shame.

543
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,590
Goodbye, Hampton.

544
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,311
- Nothing seems wrong.
- She wants to go to hospital.

545
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,915
- So does half the country.
- I<i>'</i>m dying!

546
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,470
- See? She should go to hospital.
- You should go to jug,

547
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,472
dragging a doctor out at this time
for nothing.

548
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,996
- Deliberately, I expect.
- All right. Have it your way,

549
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:12,039
- but I<i>'</i>m going to the Council.
- You can go to UN0.

550
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:16,511
Very funny. But you<i>'</i>ll be laughing
out the other side of your face soon.

551
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:21,230
I<i>'</i>ll be complaining first thing in
the morning. I<i>'</i>ll get you unfrocked!

552
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,673
Good night.

553
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,196
Call yourself a doctor?
Well, doctor this!

554
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,759
(Yells in pain)

555
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,510
- Jug<i>'</i>s come to you.
- You old bag! What are you doing?

556
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:36,275
The Doctor<i>'</i>s right. Dying, my foot.
I<i>'</i>ll have the law on you!

557
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,999
Doctor, you<i>'</i>ll be my witness,
won<i>'</i>t you?

558
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,555
- Hello.
- 0h, do go back to bed.

559
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,438
He<i>'</i>s out.
He had to see the bank manager.

560
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,956
- Go back to bed, anyway.
- I can<i>'</i>t sleep. I<i>'</i>m lonely.

561
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,270
He<i>'</i>ll be away for a long time.

562
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,316
Would you like a cup of tea?

563
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,915
- It<i>'</i>s the middle of the night.
- Aren<i>'</i>t you ever lonely?

564
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,151
- Yes, but not at the moment.
- You are a spoilsport.

565
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,028
Look, get me one of those
sleeping pills from the cupboard.

566
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:20,033
I love them.
They make you feel all warm inside.

567
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,556
0h, all right.
Well, you wait here for me, will you?

568
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,596
- There you are.
- Give me the box.

569
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,638
- No, you can<i>'</i>t...
- You promised! Please!

570
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,472
(Latch rattles)

571
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,399
Your wife couldn<i>'</i>t sleep.
I was giving her a sedative.

572
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,876
Good night.

573
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,150
Cheer up, Mr Benskin.
This one<i>'</i>s on the house.

574
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,595
Ah, Padre, that<i>'</i>s jolly nice of you.

575
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,912
- You<i>'</i>ve failed examinations before.
- This one<i>'</i>s different.

576
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,118
The old man has let me know that
he<i>'</i>s not going to go on staking me.

577
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:22,352
I<i>'</i>ve got to get a job. So, tomorrow,
I set out for whatnots new,

578
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,396
via the labour exchange.

579
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,517
- Do you still want to be a doctor?
- 0f course.

580
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,114
Er, a friend of mine
told me that you...

581
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,749
- grant medical degrees here.
- (lrish accent) 0h, we do.

582
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,229
To your duties, 0ona.

583
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,437
- Could you grant me one?
- Certainly. Delighted.

584
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,399
- Come back after the weekend.
- I<i>'</i>m from England, you see.

585
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,438
0h, well, that<i>'</i>s different.
Now, let me see.

586
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,398
- The examination<i>'</i>s only viva voce.
- Eh?

587
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,038
0ral, d<i>'</i>you know?

588
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,635
- Ah, oui. 0ui, oui.
- Maybe we could do it in the taxi.

589
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,870
Come on with me now. Taxi!

590
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,356
Will you take my clubs?

591
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,914
Up you get.
To the golf course, Seamus.

592
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,117
Now, then. Have you had any
breakfast, Mr, er...?

593
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,430
Benskin. No.

594
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:16,069
Well, take a sup of this.
It<i>'</i>s nourishing.

595
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,597
Now, then. The examination.
Let me think.

596
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,638
Er, what do you know about urea?

597
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,632
The chemical substance or my lughole?

598
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,836
Either.

599
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:36,153
Well, urea is a soluble crystalline
compound found in the human body.

600
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,719
Right!

601
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,360
- Really?
- Well, I think so.

602
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,000
- Good stuff, this.
- 0h, it<i>'</i>s the best.

603
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:48,950
Now, next question.
What do you know of fibrillation?

604
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,555
- Fibrillation?
- Fibrillation.

605
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,950
- It<i>'</i>s a pretty word, isn<i>'</i>t it?
- Ah, it is that.

606
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,749
- It<i>'</i>s a bit of a nerve.
- That<i>'</i>s what we<i>'</i>ve all got!

607
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:04,152
- 0h! 0h, very good.
- I think I<i>'</i>ll have some of that.

608
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,629
It may improve my swing.

609
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:12,430
Now, then. Next question...
Ah, to blazes. You think of one.

610
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,750
Well, now...

611
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:20,470
I can think of plenty of questions.
The answers are the problem.

612
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,438
What do you do in that case, eh?

613
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,672
- Well, that<i>'</i>s quite a question.
- 0h, that<i>'</i>s a stiff one.

614
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,196
Do you know what I<i>'</i>d do?
Go and call a specialist.

615
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,113
Full marks.
Who<i>'</i>d object to that treatment?

616
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:38,079
Make them work instead of sitting
on their... Ah, here we are now.

617
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,869
Congratulations. You<i>'</i>ve passed.
That<i>'</i>ll be 50 guineas.

618
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:45,509
I was told it would be. Erm...

619
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,239
Ah, thank you.
I<i>'</i>ll send your receipt,

620
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,276
and, of course, your diploma.

621
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,272
This is all quite legal,
I suppose, isn<i>'</i>t it?

622
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:58,036
You couldn<i>'</i>t be better qualified
if you<i>'</i>d been to Trinity College.

623
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,355
(Wolf whistles)

624
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,512
Hello.

625
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:21,832
You don<i>'</i>t look at all well.
I<i>'</i>m a doctor. Can I help?

626
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,878
- I<i>'</i>m very well.
- 0h...

627
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,474
Well, you look a little green.

628
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:31,075
Not as green as all that... Doctor.

629
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,715
I had those tactics tried on me
the first time I crossed...

630
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,030
back in the paddle boat era.

631
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:42,396
Clumsy. I<i>'</i>m bound to say
he got me in the end, though.

632
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,994
In a loose box
at the Dublin Horse Show.

633
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,550
- Really?
- Know anything about them?

634
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,553
- Well, I flatter myself...
- No, no. I mean horses.

635
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,835
I<i>'</i>ve just been across buying some.

636
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:58,310
- 0h? How many?
- 0h, 20 or 30. I<i>'</i>ve forgotten.

637
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,039
- Are you really a doctor?
- Yes, I am.

638
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,839
- Experienced?
- Well, I, er...

639
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,436
I<i>'</i>m looking for one. I sent my last
to the knackers some months ago.

640
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,433
Come and see me. Lady Howkins.
Everybody knows me in Wiltshire.

641
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:31,593
Now, I don<i>'</i>t want any rubbish
with stethoscopes and prodding.

642
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,797
If I<i>'</i>m ill, I know what<i>'</i>s wrong
and what puts me right.

643
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,917
All you have to do
is sign the prescriptions.

644
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,312
- You can read and write, I suppose?
- Yes, I think so.

645
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,278
Apart from that
and taking the dogs for walks

646
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:49,831
and dealing with emergencies amongst
the staff, your time is your own.

647
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,549
I<i>'</i>ll give you a thousand a year
and if you want any relief -

648
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,710
and you look the type that would -

649
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,837
there are plenty
of pretty local girls.

650
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:03,710
But confine your activities to the
west wing and don<i>'</i>t shock the cook.

651
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,837
I always lost cooks
when my husband was alive.

652
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,878
0f course, one could replace them
in those days.

653
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,191
He<i>'</i>s been dead 20 years,
but not before collecting

654
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,352
most of the diamond mines
in South Africa.

655
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,398
Well, do you want the job?

656
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:22,950
- Yes, I do, indeed.
- I<i>'</i>m as fit as a flea at the moment,

657
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,996
and so are the staff.

658
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:29,471
I may drop dead at any moment,
but that<i>'</i>ll just be bad luck on you.

659
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,074
Ring the bell. We<i>'</i>ll have champagne.

660
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,754
I<i>'</i>ve a thirst
like the Kalahari Desert.

661
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,400
- Congratulations.
- Who told you? Joy?

662
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,040
- I<i>'</i>m delighted.
- Thank you very much.

663
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,635
- Bangers. The dog<i>'</i>s had one.
- I haven<i>'</i>t got a frying pan.

664
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,349
0h, it doesn<i>'</i>t matter.
Just lay them out cold and operate.

665
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:51,750
- I thought you were up north?
- I was, but I resigned.

666
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:55,230
- He<i>'</i>s out of a job.
- Nice to have me home, though.

667
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:59,233
Trouble with the doctor<i>'</i>s wife.
You know the sort of thing.

668
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:02,995
0h, was there?
They should be kept on a chain.

669
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,832
Not too short, but a chain.

670
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,354
That smells rather good. What is it?

671
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,558
It said baked beans on the tin
but they diagnosed it wrong.

672
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:12,789
(Barks)

673
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,555
You had cornflakes for breakfast.
Now, go away.

674
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,993
(Whines)

675
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,150
I think these are stewed plums.

676
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,595
Then, I<i>'</i>d cut down on the seasoning.

677
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,636
- Emerald!
- Mmm?

678
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:29,316
A girl I met in an espresso bar.
She<i>'</i>s the receptionist to a doctor.

679
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:33,359
His partner<i>'</i>s sick and he<i>'</i>s looking
for a stand-in. Park Lane.

680
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,318
- I<i>'</i>ll call her.
- No, Tony. I<i>'</i>m not the type.

681
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:41,269
- I haven<i>'</i>t got enough experience.
- Don<i>'</i>t worry. I<i>'</i>ll glamorize you.

682
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,828
I<i>'</i>ll give you such a build-up.

683
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:59,273
- Good afternoon. I<i>'</i>m Dr Sparrow.
- 0h, yes. Come in.

684
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:02,432
I<i>'</i>m afraid he<i>'</i>s busy.
Would you mind waiting?

685
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,715
No. No.

686
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,273
Would you take a seat
over there, please?

687
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,869
Now, my dear, don<i>'</i>t worry.
You can ring me if you want to.

688
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,396
Razzy, you<i>'</i>re marvellous.
I feel better already.

689
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,436
Dr Sparrow, Doctor.

690
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:26,479
0h, yes. I<i>'</i>ll be with you
in one minute, my dear fellow.

691
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:34,109
- Hello, Dr Sparrow.
- How do you do?

692
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,475
You<i>'</i>ll forgive me turning you out?

693
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:40,109
No, I won<i>'</i>t, but it doesn<i>'</i>t matter.
I<i>'</i>ll telephone.

694
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,712
We<i>'</i>ll go into the consulting room,
shall we?

695
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,352
- Exquisite creature, isn<i>'</i>t she?
- Charming.

696
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:59,833
Very over... Very neurotic, though.
0h, well. All part of the grind.

697
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,150
Do sit down, my dear man.

698
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,430
It<i>'</i>s so good of you
to step into the breach like this.

699
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:10,957
My partner slipped a disc,
you know. It<i>'</i>s a great bore for him.

700
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,395
He<i>'</i>ll be away three months, at least.

701
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,836
Yes, I<i>'</i>m afraid he<i>'</i>s bound
to miss Ascot, poor chap.

702
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,753
- Poor chap.
- Trouble is, it<i>'</i>s so difficult

703
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:23,037
to find the right person
to replace him.

704
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:26,954
This is rather a special practice.
The NHS is all very well,

705
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:30,635
but some prefer manners
with medicine, don<i>'</i>t you find?

706
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,712
- Yes, I do.
- Smoke? Turkish or Virginia.

707
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,552
Thank you.

708
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:39,758
0f course, you<i>'</i>ve been out of the
country for a while, haven<i>'</i>t you?

709
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:42,877
That Himalayan expedition
sounds fascinating.

710
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,999
What<i>'</i>s- his-name told my secretary
about it. You know...

711
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:51,551
I can<i>'</i>t help admitting I do find
young doctors today terribly dull.

712
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:54,757
They will treat
their patients like guinea pigs.

713
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:58,037
By the way, did you meet
old Charrington out there?

714
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,951
- No.
- 0h, really?

715
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:04,397
He<i>'</i>s always shinning up mountains.
Perhaps it<i>'</i>s the Alps.

716
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,359
Nice chap. His sister married
one of those Austrian princes.

717
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,034
I treated him
for nervous prostration.

718
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:14,192
Dr Potter-Shine,
I ought to tell you, really...

719
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,158
0h, my dear chap,
that<i>'</i>s quite all right.

720
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:21,711
I don<i>'</i>t want references. I pride
myself on being a good judge of men.

721
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,189
I wish I could
say the same for horses.

722
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,078
- We<i>'</i>ll consider you engaged.
- Thank you.

723
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:30,948
If you, er... If you want any salary,
ask my secretary.

724
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,679
I was brought up never
to discuss money.

725
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,194
It<i>'</i>s a little vulgar,
don<i>'</i>t you think?

726
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,748
And, oh, er... forgive me...

727
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:42,753
Perhaps you have something
a little more formal to wear.

728
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,274
I suppose you picked those up
in Tibet?

729
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,158
See my tailor
and charge it to the practice.

730
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,992
It<i>'</i>s a chastening thought,

731
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:54,551
but good clothes are more important
to a GP than a good stethoscope.

732
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:14,430
- Morning, Nurse.
- Good morning. Razzy isn<i>'</i>t in yet.

733
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:18,433
- Who<i>'</i>s Razzy?
- The Doctor. It<i>'</i>s short for Erasmus.

734
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:23,799
And you needn<i>'</i>t call me Nurse.
It<i>'</i>s a bit stiff. Emerald.

735
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,952
- Aren<i>'</i>t you a nurse?
- I played one in the films once.

736
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:31,352
Razzy wanted someone around who
wasn<i>'</i>t an old bag. He<i>'</i>s very sweet.

737
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,477
- I see.
- Good morning, my dear fellow.

738
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:37,199
That<i>'</i>s very good.
I like the trousers.

739
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,475
Such a boring thing has happened.

740
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:42,836
This is my day to visit
old Skye and Lewes - the Duke.

741
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:46,799
At the crack of dawn, some actress
rings up with laryngitis.

742
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,155
- What is one to do?
- Can<i>'</i>t she wait?

743
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:52,073
My dear boy, in this practice,
no one waits.

744
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,958
I<i>'</i>ll take the actress,
the papers will be there.

745
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:59,477
You do the Duke. Take the Rolls.
Hold the fort, Emerald.

746
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:03,519
- What<i>'</i>s wrong with the Duke?
- Just give him his usual treatment.

747
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:09,277
- Well, what is his usual treatment?
- I don<i>'</i>t know, but here<i>'</i>s his card.

748
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:12,955
Twenty guineas a visit.
That<i>'</i>s all it says.

749
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:16,916
- Dr Sparrow, Your Grace.
- Good morning, Doctor.

750
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,993
Heard Potter-Shine couldn<i>'</i>t come,
but you know about the case.

751
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:24,117
- Well, not everything.
- Don<i>'</i>t go into details.

752
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:27,272
- My blood pressure goes up.
- We don<i>'</i>t want that.

753
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:30,238
I<i>'</i>ve had the horse moved
by the window.

754
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,515
- The horse?
- Yes, it<i>'</i>s sluggish.

755
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:36,115
- Down in spirit or something.
- It<i>'</i>s indisposed?

756
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:40,318
(Laughs) Well, come and have a look,
will you? Draw the curtains.

757
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,154
0h, by the way, Doctor.
I<i>'</i>m advised to get a camel.

758
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,959
- Really?
- They kneel down when you get on,

759
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,600
and when you<i>'</i>re on, they lie down.

760
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:54,435
Come along. We haven<i>'</i>t got any time
to waste. Have you got your watch?

761
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,476
- Yes.
- Well, get it out.

762
00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:00,712
And start this thing up, will you?
Dash it. Reins in the wrong place.

763
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,950
- Start it up.
- Where<i>'</i>s the knob?

764
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:06,112
There. It<i>'</i>s somewhere there.
That<i>'</i>s good.

765
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:11,399
0nly, er... 0nly ten minutes.
Not a moment longer than ten... ten...

766
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,471
- Stop! Stop!
- Stop?

767
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:17,519
No good. No good.
I<i>'</i>m going to get a... get a camel.

768
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:21,479
Now... Put me down.
Now you have a try.

769
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:24,472
- Me?
- That<i>'</i>s what you<i>'</i>re paid for, right?

770
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,154
Well, get up and have a go.
It won<i>'</i>t hurt you.

771
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:30,038
- You<i>'</i>ll pay the damages?
- Very good.

772
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:34,193
I suppose you<i>'</i>re charging
the same outlandish fee as Shine?

773
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:37,272
I never discuss money matters.
They<i>'</i>re vulgar.

774
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:40,750
Well, yes. I still prefer a camel,
you know, myself.

775
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:44,150
Me, too.
I<i>'</i>m not doing you any good up here.

776
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,037
No. You<i>'</i>re not doing any harm.

777
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,430
Do you mind my slipping off?
There are no appointments.

778
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:54,354
No, off you go.
Where<i>'</i>s Razzy gone this afternoon?

779
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:57,910
He<i>'</i>s playing golf with some patient.
Janet or Joanna.

780
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,798
- He won<i>'</i>t be back today.
- Enjoy yourself.

781
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,997
I<i>'</i>m going to an audition, actually.
Bye-bye.

782
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,071
Good luck.

783
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,872
(Whistling)

784
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,912
(Buzzer)

785
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:21,159
How do you do? I have
an appointment with Dr Potter-Shine.

786
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,994
There must be some mistake.
He<i>'</i>s away. I<i>'</i>m his partner.

787
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,355
My private secretary arranged it.

788
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,796
- 0h, I<i>'</i>ll just look in the book.
- Thank you.

789
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,270
- What<i>'</i>s your name again?
- The Maharajah of Branda.

790
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,510
0h, please... I beg your pardon.

791
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,953
Ah. Your appointment<i>'</i>s
for next Friday.

792
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:45,716
That foolish secretary.
I<i>'</i>ll be at the Venice Film Festival.

793
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:49,759
Perhaps I might have a consultation
with you. It<i>'</i>s my back.

794
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:53,913
I strained it on a tiger shoot.
It<i>'</i>s still rather painful.

795
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,309
- A tiger shoot?
- Mmm... Yes.

796
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,234
- Really? I<i>'</i>ll have a look at it.
- Thank you so much.

797
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,789
- Take your clothes off.
- All of them?

798
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,235
- Except...
- I never take that off.

799
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,673
(Buzzer)

800
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,315
- I want to see Razzy.
- I<i>'</i>m sorry. He<i>'</i>s not here.

801
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,356
I have to see Razzy, I...

802
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:17,273
- I think I<i>'</i>m going to die.
- I don<i>'</i>t think so.

803
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,794
How would you know? 0nly Razzy knows.

804
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,836
- You can<i>'</i>t go in there.
- Why not?

805
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,310
- Because you can<i>'</i>t.
- He<i>'</i>s in there.

806
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:28,278
He doesn<i>'</i>t want to see me.
He<i>'</i>s tired of me.

807
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,158
I promise you.
I have a patient in there.

808
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:35,870
- I don<i>'</i>t believe a word of it.
- You can<i>'</i>t go in there.

809
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:38,952
All right. I<i>'</i>ll get him out.

810
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:44,313
- Control yourself. I beg you.
- I want Razzy.

811
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,391
I<i>'</i>ve told you, he<i>'</i>s playing golf.

812
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,756
Who with?
That cat Joanna, I suppose.

813
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:52,638
- Yes, I believe so.
- (Screeches)

814
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,473
- Don<i>'</i>t be so ridiculous!
- 0h!

815
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:59,553
- You struck a woman!
- Yes, I did.

816
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:02,074
And I warn you, I<i>'</i>ll do it again.

817
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:10,157
(Sobbing) 0h, please take me home.

818
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,393
I can<i>'</i>t... can<i>'</i>t do that, really.

819
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:20,468
- I<i>'</i>ll get you a taxi.
- No! No. Please take me home.

820
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:25,270
I... I can<i>'</i>t
possibly face this alone.

821
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:29,069
I... I have a half-naked patient
in there.

822
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,035
If you don<i>'</i>t take me home,

823
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:36,908
I shall sit on the pavement
and scream until Razzy comes.

824
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,150
- I wouldn<i>'</i>t do that.
- I would.

825
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:42,118
In fact, I<i>'</i>ll start now.
(Begins to scream)

826
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:45,510
All right. I<i>'</i>ll take you home,
but we must be quick.

827
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,875
Er... Where do you live, please?

828
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:51,430
I think you<i>'</i>re sweet.
It<i>'</i>s quite close.

829
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:53,952
Right.

830
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,313
(Screams)

831
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:01,996
I<i>'</i>m afraid I made rather a fool of
myself, getting worked up like that.

832
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:06,676
It must have been the brandy.
I<i>'</i>m sorry I clocked you one.

833
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:09,069
Well, I started it, didn<i>'</i>t I?

834
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:15,155
It must be wonderful to be a doctor
and cure people who are stricken.

835
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:19,159
It has its rewarding moments.

836
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:21,629
I think you<i>'</i>re sweet.

837
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,109
- Do you?
- Mmm.

838
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:28,557
Can I have some more milk or do you
think it would be bad for me?

839
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:32,553
- I<i>'</i>ll take your advice.
- It would be very good for you.

840
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,152
(Buzzer)

841
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,993
Hello?

842
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,957
Emerald?

843
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,555
Simon? Anybody at home?

844
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,437
(Knocks)

845
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,916
I beg your pardon.

846
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:04,840
Excuse me. It<i>'</i>s none of my business,
but aren<i>'</i>t you getting goose pimples?

847
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:10,675
It<i>'</i>s lovely to have someone
hold your hand, sympathise with you,

848
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:15,072
tell you you<i>'</i>re wonderful,
even if you<i>'</i>re not really very ill.

849
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:18,470
That<i>'</i>s where Razzy<i>'</i>s so marvellous.

850
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,755
Have you ever noticed his eyes?

851
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,792
No.

852
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:27,509
They<i>'</i>re hypnotic. Cruel and hypnotic.

853
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:32,511
I<i>'</i>m afraid
I can<i>'</i>t aspire to those heights

854
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:37,037
but I can sympathise with you,
tell you that you<i>'</i>re wonderful.

855
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:42,598
Hmm... Yes, I...
I really feel very much better.

856
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,479
You<i>'</i>re a very good doctor.

857
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,596
I know a little, I think.

858
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,069
I<i>'</i>m sure you do.

859
00:57:54,560 --> 00:58:00,795
You know, when you look at me
like that, you look hypnotic, too.

860
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,238
I don<i>'</i>t feel hypnotic.

861
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:24,912
I feel like a slave girl with
a lovely, fierce oriental potentate.

862
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,913
0riental potentate...

863
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,430
Crikey!

864
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:43,189
- Tony!
- Hello, my dear fellow.

865
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:46,033
You haven<i>'</i>t got a spiked mattress,
have you?

866
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:49,749
His Highness is giving me a few tips.
Was that all right?

867
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:57,470
- 0oh, you<i>'</i>ve been at the jam.
- What? 0h...

868
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:03,239
I<i>'</i>m so sorry we<i>'</i>re parting, dear boy,

869
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:06,949
but Willoughby swears he<i>'</i>s fit enough
to start work again,

870
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:11,079
and I expect you<i>'</i>re itching
to get back to the Himalayas, eh?

871
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:16,757
Razzy, you<i>'</i>ve been so good to me
that I feel I must make a confession.

872
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:21,118
The Himalayas story... it was a lie.

873
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,998
Really? 0h, I am glad.

874
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:27,914
Terribly cold and uncomfortable
it must be for them up there.

875
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,198
You<i>'</i>ve been a success here. All the
neurotic women are in love with you.

876
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:34,874
They must be in love
with their doctor.

877
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,713
Speaking frankly,
it keeps them from suicide.

878
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:41,236
0ne doesn<i>'</i>t have to be in love
with them, which is a relief.

879
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:45,199
- What do you plan to do now?
- I<i>'</i>ve got a job in the country.

880
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:48,750
It won<i>'</i>t be as much fun
but I<i>'</i>ll get some reading done.

881
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:51,354
- I want to take up surgery.
- Ah, yes.

882
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:55,672
Fascinating subject, I think,
if a little on the ghoulish side.

883
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,513
Well, goodbye, dear boy,
and good luck.

884
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,989
(Siren)

885
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:10,637
(Policeman) Pull over, please.
Pull over to the kerb.

886
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,994
Are you the owner
of this contraption?

887
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:24,150
- What?
- This conveyance?

888
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:25,992
Yes, I am.

889
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:29,709
You know there are regulations
for vehicle road-worthiness?

890
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:32,598
- Yes.
- Has this one got efficient brakes?

891
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:35,990
Absolutely wonderful.
Brake on a postage stamp.

892
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:40,119
We<i>'</i>ll try a demonstration.
Proceed at normal speed. I<i>'</i>ll follow.

893
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:43,033
When you hear my horn,
apply your brakes.

894
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:45,076
Let<i>'</i>s go.

895
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,392
(Horn sounds)

896
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:11,835
(Screech of brakes, crash)

897
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:28,472
I, er... I can give you a tow
into Grantham, if you like.

898
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:39,068
- How do you like these raspberries?
- They<i>'</i>re wonderful.

899
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:43,153
0ld Mrs Crockett<i>'</i>s lumbago produces
them year after year.

900
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:47,995
0ne of the advantages for an old man
practising in the back of beyond

901
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:51,516
is that the patients
are still inclined to pay in kind.

902
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:54,831
The cream<i>'</i>s the postmistress<i>'</i>s
prickly heat. More?

903
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:57,354
- Thank you.
- I hope you<i>'</i>ll like it here.

904
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:00,910
- I shall, I think.
- A change after Harley Street.

905
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,116
Not much bedside manner needed.

906
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:07,113
Half think they<i>'</i>ll drop dead
if they take their vests off.

907
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,511
(Horn sounds)

908
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:23,193
Here, mind you don<i>'</i>t come down
on top of them spikes.

909
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:27,956
I<i>'</i>d a pig got caught in that greedy
devil one time. Come out rashers.

910
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:29,678
(Cock crows)

911
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,235
(Cow moos)

912
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,956
(Pigs grunt)

913
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,753
(Dogs barking, children shouting)

914
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,956
Well, what<i>'</i>s wrong with you?

915
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,598
(Grunting)

916
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:55,559
He says he feels as if he<i>'</i>s got
rabbits running along his spine.

917
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:59,076
- Rabbits? Do they hurt?
- Like heck, they do.

918
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:02,277
We<i>'</i>d better examine you.
Take off your shirt.

919
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:06,194
- What? All of them?
- 0h, now, come along, Dad.

920
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,840
- How<i>'</i>s his appetite?
- Lovely, Doctor.

921
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,273
Good.

922
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:13,113
He ain<i>'</i>t half going to give
Grandpa the works.

923
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:16,795
Away you go, all of you.
I<i>'</i>ll scalp your wee lugs.

924
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:20,077
- Wee horrors.
- I can<i>'</i>t find anything wrong.

925
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:23,550
I<i>'</i>ll send you some tablets
to make him sleep.

926
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:27,269
You<i>'</i>re supposed to be a doctor.
What about my rabbits?

927
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,999
I suggest we put a ferret in
after them.

928
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:33,993
0ld lves, he<i>'</i>s a villain.
Did you use the thermometer?

929
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:36,753
No, the only one I could find
was broken.

930
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:40,355
I<i>'</i>m afraid
my equipment<i>'</i>s not very up-to-date.

931
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:42,396
Not entirely, no.

932
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:45,870
If I can<i>'</i>t tell
if a patient<i>'</i>s feverish by now,

933
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:48,235
I<i>'</i>m not much of a doctor.

934
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:53,235
But shove it under their tongues,
anyway. You<i>'</i>ll stop them talking.

935
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:57,393
- I<i>'</i>ll remember that.
- You must let them talk sometimes.

936
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,436
They need to.

937
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:02,034
They don<i>'</i>t like boring their friends,

938
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:05,396
their relatives won<i>'</i>t listen
to them any more,

939
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:07,436
they<i>'</i>re nervy of the parson,

940
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:11,433
so the doctor<i>'</i>s the only one
they can pour out their hearts to.

941
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:15,877
Maybe I<i>'</i>ve got old-fashioned ideas
but it seems to me part of the job.

942
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:18,030
Perhaps the most important part.

943
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:24,036
Yes, I agree with you. Hadn<i>'</i>t thought
of it like that before.

944
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:26,076
Chap came in today,

945
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:31,188
said he had a strong erotic sensation
every time he blew his nose.

946
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:34,795
Really? That<i>'</i>s interesting.

947
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:37,030
- What did you say?
- Nothing much.

948
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:40,351
I<i>'</i>m not up in psychiatry.
What would you have said?

949
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:43,512
I should have told him
some people have all the luck.

950
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:46,317
- Come in, Doctor.
- Thank you.

951
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,914
- Sit down, won<i>'</i>t you?
- How about you?

952
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,798
I like standing up,
if you don<i>'</i>t mind.

953
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:54,474
Well, what can I do for you?

954
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:58,439
The fact is, Doctor,
I had a little accident with my gun.

955
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:01,239
0h, I see.
Got some shot in you, have you?

956
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,470
- That<i>'</i>s it.
- Where?

957
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:06,836
Where it makes me prefer standing up.

958
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:10,879
0h, I see. How on earth did
you manage to shoot yourself there?

959
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:15,988
Er, well, it was my dog. You see, I
left my gun standing in the corner,

960
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:19,755
and my old Bess got her paw
on the trigger.

961
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,236
I<i>'</i>d better have a look at it.

962
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:25,834
- Go and lie down on your stomach.
- Yes.

963
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:34,192
- How does it feel now?
- Much easier. Thank you.

964
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:36,510
Excuse me a moment.

965
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:43,309
Doctor, perhaps you<i>'</i>d care
to accept that as a present?

966
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,960
- I can<i>'</i>t take that.
- Take it, Doctor.

967
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:49,237
Dr Farquarson likes a bit of salmon
with his supper.

968
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,311
How have you enjoyed it here?

969
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,595
Very much. I<i>'</i>m sorry to be leaving.

970
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:56,035
It<i>'</i>s changed and so have the people,

971
01:05:56,120 --> 01:06:00,272
thanks to the welfare state and
education and bus routes and so on.

972
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:03,318
They still like getting
something for nothing.

973
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:06,995
And they still come
to my stretch of water and poach it,

974
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:09,036
just as in Grandfather<i>'</i>s day.

975
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:12,396
They<i>'</i>ve not changed altogether.
0pen the wine.

976
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:17,554
I was down by the river last night.
Somebody<i>'</i>s been getting at my fish.

977
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:22,794
There was a fellow there on the bank,
oh, with a big one.

978
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,075
Then he saw me and he ran.

979
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,355
I had my shotgun,
so I loosed off.

980
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:32,035
I must have peppered him
but he didn<i>'</i>t drop the fish.

981
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:36,636
Damn it. If this goes on, I shan<i>'</i>t
get to eat my own fish any more.

982
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:39,632
Give the Colonel some wine,
will you, lad?

983
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:41,676
Right up.

984
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:49,034
- Sorry to be losing you.
- I<i>'</i>m sorry to be going.

985
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:54,430
Well, here we are again,
back on the streets.

986
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:57,717
Let<i>'</i>s drink to it. Mind that.

987
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:00,678
Thank you.
What happened to your old lady?

988
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:04,196
0h, she<i>'</i>s not with us any more,
old boy.

989
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:08,478
She took me to a race meeting.
Chirpy as anything on the way there,

990
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:12,633
but in the middle of slanging
a bookie, she went, just like that.

991
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:16,110
Heart. Still, it<i>'</i>s the way
she<i>'</i>d have liked to have gone.

992
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:20,034
If anyone enjoyed life, she did.
Bless her.

993
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:22,156
And what now?

994
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:25,835
I don<i>'</i>t know. Something will turn up.
What about you?

995
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,309
I<i>'</i>d like to go back to the hospital.

996
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:31,039
I<i>'</i>ve got to phone
some solicitors. May I?

997
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:32,792
Yes, of course.

998
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:36,111
I suppose that blighter
Bingham<i>'</i>s still there?

999
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:41,069
- Yes. He asked me out to supper.
- Did you go?

1000
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:44,869
Fish cake and chips and a quiz
on obstetrics? No thanks.

1001
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:50,671
- Mr Wayland? Dr Benskin here.
- Good of you to call, Dr Benskin.

1002
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:53,513
We<i>'</i>re handling the estate
of Lady Howkins.

1003
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:56,319
Did you know
that she left you a legacy?

1004
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,756
- No, I didn<i>'</i>t.
- <i>'</i>Yes, a sum of money.

1005
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:02,559
<i>'</i>Quite a large one,
as a matter of fact. £15,000.<i>'</i>

1006
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:07,395
- 15,000... Thousand?
- <i>'</i>Thousand.

1007
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:10,631
<i>'</i>She was, as you know,
a very wealthy woman...<i>'</i>

1008
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:13,553
I<i>'</i>m rich! 15,000 quid!

1009
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:17,030
Lady Howkins left me £15,000
in her will!

1010
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,389
0h, oh, Tony!

1011
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:23,631
You are to donate it to some hospital

1012
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:27,349
or medical institution of your choice
within six months.

1013
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:30,193
- Bring her back.
- (Joy squeals) Simon!

1014
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:34,149
Wi... Are you there?

1015
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:36,913
<i>'</i>Are you there, Dr Benskin?<i>'</i>

1016
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:39,990
Hello. Yes, I am here. Yes.

1017
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:43,436
I<i>'</i>m afraid we can<i>'</i>t give you
the cheque right away,

1018
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,830
but we<i>'</i>ll get it to you soon,
or perhaps you<i>'</i>ll call?

1019
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:50,993
- Whatever you say, old boy.
- We<i>'</i>ll be in touch later. Goodbye.

1020
01:08:55,040 --> 01:09:00,319
The old darling. I never dreamt
she<i>'</i>d turn up trumps like that.

1021
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,960
15,000!
What are you going to do with it?

1022
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:08,398
I don<i>'</i>t know. 0pen a nursing home
for millionaires in the West Indies,

1023
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:11,119
or chip into the face-lifting racket.

1024
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:15,751
But first,
I<i>'</i>m going to flog the old bus

1025
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:18,593
and have a delicious holiday
in the sun,

1026
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:21,069
and you<i>'</i>re both coming as my guests.

1027
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:23,720
I<i>'</i>ll find something
when we get there.

1028
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,957
(Tony growls lecherously)

1029
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,718
- Tony!
- Yeah?

1030
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:37,360
- We want to eat.
- 0h, yes. Hello.

1031
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:40,591
- What do you want, sir?
- Er, steak. Underdone.

1032
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:43,956
I think that<i>'</i>ll
be enough to go on with. Joy?

1033
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:47,669
Joy, stop reading about dyspepsia
and give yourself it.

1034
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,113
What?

1035
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:53,352
- What would you like to eat, dear?
- 0h! 0h, everything.

1036
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:56,238
- The lot for the lady.
- Bien, monsieur.

1037
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,356
Yes!

1038
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:01,671
Funny how sea air
makes you feel peckish, isn<i>'</i>t it?

1039
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:08,156
0h, no!

1040
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:11,595
- What<i>'</i>s the matter?
- Hopcroft!

1041
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:13,238
- Who?
- Hopcroft!

1042
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:16,756
A governor at St Swithin<i>'</i>s.
I got into trouble with him.

1043
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:20,071
- Forget about him.
- What<i>'</i>s he doing here?

1044
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:28,433
0h, pardon, madame... mademoiselle.

1045
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:33,036
- What would you like to drink, sir?
- Something cold and bubbly.

1046
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:36,317
- Champagne. Cliquot <i>'</i>47.
- Bien, monsieur.

1047
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:40,552
Funny how sea air
makes you feel thirsty, as well.

1048
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,436
0h!

1049
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,868
Mmm, ahh.

1050
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:06,358
Nous aurons bien le temps
d<i>'</i>aller sur la plage.

1051
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:09,114
(Growls)

1052
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:12,590
- Funny how sea air makes you feel...
- Black or white?

1053
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:15,638
Well, they both have their points,
you know.

1054
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:18,029
Er... black.

1055
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:30,875
Pardon, madame! Pardon, madame.

1056
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:33,872
0h! Tu es completement dingue.

1057
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:36,912
(Shouting)

1058
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,514
Mes yeux! Mes yeux!

1059
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,556
Good Lord! It<i>'</i>s old Hopcroft!

1060
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:46,274
What on earth<i>'</i>s he up to?

1061
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:50,672
- He seems to be in trouble.
- I suppose we<i>'</i>d better help him.

1062
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:52,796
(Shouting and arguing)

1063
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:05,749
Non, mes yeux! Mes yeux!

1064
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,229
(Tony) Vous... vous... dirty old homme!

1065
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:12,074
Quiet! Calmez-vous! Calmez-vous!

1066
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:14,071
Get in there. Get in there!

1067
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:17,152
Calmez-vous! Les gendarmes viennent!

1068
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:21,279
Police! Police! Police!

1069
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:26,430
- Police! Police!
- (Gendarme) Reculez! Circulez!

1070
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:29,193
Come on, sir. Mind your head.

1071
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:33,471
- (Joy) Steady.
- Mind your head.

1072
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,357
Reculez, s<i>'</i>il vous plait, alors!

1073
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:40,954
- 0h! 0h!
- Pardon, mademoiselle.

1074
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,678
0h!

1075
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:48,235
- Terrible experience...
- Hello.

1076
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:51,790
- In my position. I...
- Terrible. Have another drink.

1077
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:54,030
- Tony?
- 0ught I to?

1078
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:58,432
- Certainly. Doctor<i>'</i>s orders.
- 0h, are you a doctor?

1079
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:03,640
- Er, yes, I am.
- Yes, I seem to know your face.

1080
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:07,633
- I<i>'</i>m connected with St Swithin<i>'</i>s.
- Yes, I know.

1081
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:10,234
Gentlemen,
if there<i>'</i>s anything I can do

1082
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:14,359
to express my gratitude,
please say so - anything.

1083
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:18,479
Well, as a matter of fact, sir.
There is something. I want a job.

1084
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,790
At St Swithin<i>'</i>s? 0f course.

1085
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,917
- Could you?
- 0f course I can arrange that.

1086
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,869
We should be happy
to have such brains on our staff.

1087
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:31,155
And you, sir? Do you wish to join us?

1088
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:35,472
Well, that<i>'</i>s jolly decent of you
but I don<i>'</i>t think I will.

1089
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:37,516
I have other plans.

1090
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:42,270
- Dr Benskin. Good morning.
- Good morning.

1091
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:44,396
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.

1092
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,550
- I have your cheque.
- Splendid.

1093
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:49,996
Should we hold it until you decide
what you<i>'</i>ll do with it?

1094
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:54,631
0h, no, thanks, I-I<i>'</i>ve decided.
I<i>'</i>ll take it. D-D-Don<i>'</i>t wrap it.

1095
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:59,515
The executors would be interested

1096
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,717
to know what plans you have
for its disposal.

1097
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:05,473
Well, quite a lot of things,
you know.

1098
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:07,437
A new ward?

1099
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:10,830
No, I think I<i>'</i>m a little young
to be a guardian yet,

1100
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:13,878
but I like the idea, I must say.

1101
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:19,030
Dr Benskin,
perhaps you<i>'</i>d better read the will.

1102
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,872
I told you on the telephone

1103
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:24,077
but sometimes it<i>'</i>s helpful
to see it in print.

1104
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:26,230
It<i>'</i>s there.

1105
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:34,116
Blimey!

1106
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:36,873
Shall we go on holding it for you?

1107
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:38,996
You<i>'</i>ll know what to do with it.

1108
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:52,190
I wonder if you could, er, possibly
lend me sixpence for the bus fare?

1109
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:58,313
- (Tony) 0i, road hog!
- Morning.

1110
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:03,076
Hardly a Bentley, but it<i>'</i>ll save you
walking the last few steps. Any luck?

1111
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:05,833
Hopcroft got me a job
with old Halebridge.

1112
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:08,673
He<i>'</i>s anaesthetics.
You know nothing about <i>'</i>em.

1113
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:11,718
All done by machines these days.
Twiddle a knob.

1114
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:13,836
Just like driving a car.

1115
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:16,275
0h, blast.

1116
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:19,033
Supposing you give them
too much choke?

1117
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:23,472
- Morning, Sir Lancelot.
- Morning, Whittle.

1118
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:29,875
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- (All) Good morning, sir.

1119
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:42,471
0h, hello, Sparrow. I heard
you were back in the old home.

1120
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:45,313
My case now, I think.

1121
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:47,960
Well, what are they doing
with you, hmm?

1122
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:49,837
0h, I<i>'</i>m back in Casualty.

1123
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:53,913
Yes, I<i>'</i>m with old Spratt.
You remember Sir Lancelot?

1124
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,353
Yes.

1125
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:58,432
He<i>'</i>s come to rely on me,
though I shouldn<i>'</i>t say so.

1126
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,476
Come along, my man. Pursue me.

1127
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:03,996
Why do I have to walk so far?
It<i>'</i>s like a rabbit warren.

1128
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:07,834
It<i>'</i>s a wonder we aren<i>'</i>t dead
of myxomatosis. Don<i>'</i>t you agree?

1129
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:11,469
- Quite right, Sir Lancelot.
- I hope so. What have I got?

1130
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:14,438
A thoracotomy
and a perforated gastric ulcer.

1131
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:18,035
Another one? It<i>'</i>s lunatic enough
to get an ulcer at all,

1132
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:20,076
without getting holes through it.

1133
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:23,516
- How<i>'</i>s that stomach I did?
- As well as can be expected.

1134
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,353
- Is it?
- Yes, sir.

1135
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:29,273
I thought he<i>'</i>d be
pushing up daisies already.

1136
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:31,920
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

1137
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:36,069
- You<i>'</i>re Sparrow, aren<i>'</i>t you?
- Yes, sir.

1138
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:38,469
- Back here again?
- Yes, sir.

1139
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,596
Well, keep out of my hair.

1140
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:46,869
Simon! Hello. Like it?
Nice shade of green, isn<i>'</i>t it?

1141
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,872
They<i>'</i>re not letting you
use anaesthetics?

1142
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:52,793
There are only three stages
of anaesthesia.

1143
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,599
Awake, asleep or dead.

1144
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:58,274
Blimey! You<i>'</i>ll go far.

1145
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:02,319
The thing to remember about spaghetti
is never overcook it.

1146
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:05,710
Most restaurants nowadays
boil it for about a week.

1147
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:10,271
It comes out like marine glue -
smelling like it, too. Spensor-Wells.

1148
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:13,670
- (Bingham) Can I do that for you?
- No, you can<i>'</i>t.

1149
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:17,435
(Sir Lancelot) You let it boil
15 minutes, then slosh it out.

1150
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:20,830
Take over, Benskin.
I<i>'</i>m going to finish the crossword.

1151
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:23,275
- Me?
- Yes, straightforward case.

1152
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:27,114
- Pulse as steady as a rock.
...then give it five minutes more

1153
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:30,715
in a good, brisk oven.
Cholecystectomy clamp.

1154
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:34,315
0h, remind me to buy
one of those new garlic squeezers.

1155
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,236
Swab, man. Swab.

1156
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:41,472
...we dug away, and there was a
gallstone the size of Marble Arch!

1157
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:45,599
I gave it to him as a paperweight.
He didn<i>'</i>t want it, so I use it.

1158
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:49,036
Very useful it is, too,
with all the bumf these days.

1159
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:54,353
Driving my secretary mad. However,
as long as she gets the bills out...

1160
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:56,396
Hello, this looks a bit fishy.

1161
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:59,597
- (Bingham) A transverse incision...
- Scalpel.

1162
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:09,197
(Snoring)

1163
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:12,316
Mr Anaesthetist!

1164
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:16,632
If the patient can stay awake during
his operation, surely you can!

1165
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:22,116
Hello, chaps. You know Nan?

1166
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:24,156
- 0h, hello.
- We have met.

1167
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:26,754
When are you coming
to see my research?

1168
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:29,991
You<i>'</i>ll find it interesting.
It<i>'</i>s instructive.

1169
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:32,753
- What is it?
- 0h, wait till you see.

1170
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:36,469
- Well, cheers all round.
- I thought you didn<i>'</i>t drink.

1171
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:39,358
Normally, I don<i>'</i>t,
but I<i>'</i>m celebrating.

1172
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:41,670
I<i>'</i>m engaged to be married.

1173
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,035
- Congratulations.
- But to whom?

1174
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:46,634
Well, didn<i>'</i>t you know?
Nan Macpherson.

1175
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:49,228
- 0h!
- 0h.

1176
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:54,440
I say, do you know of a place for
a honeymoon, romantic and all that?

1177
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:57,034
As a matter of fact, I do.

1178
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:59,873
It<i>'</i>s a nice little place,
very quiet.

1179
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:03,748
Suit you both perfectly.
It<i>'</i>s called the Judges Arms.

1180
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:07,719
I once stayed there
under most romantic circumstances.

1181
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:20,233
Well, that<i>'</i>s that.
Now, try and remember it.

1182
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:23,437
They<i>'</i>re bound to ask
something on antibiotics.

1183
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:26,671
- I<i>'</i>ll try.
- I must go. I<i>'</i>m on night duty.

1184
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,630
- Joy?
- Mmm?

1185
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:34,917
How could anyone
marry a bloke like Bingham?

1186
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:41,596
- I suppose she loves him.
- I suppose so. Hm!

1187
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:44,990
What a life, being married
to a doctor, anyway, eh?

1188
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:47,310
Yes, it would be a strain.

1189
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:50,597
It would be nice, too,
if you married the right one.

1190
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:52,477
- No supper?
- No, thanks.

1191
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:56,189
It<i>'</i>s not baked beans.
I<i>'</i>m on to omelettes these days.

1192
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:57,952
Joy, you<i>'</i>re very sweet.

1193
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:02,795
What would I do if you passed your
exams and beetled off somewhere?

1194
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:05,553
I<i>'</i>m don<i>'</i>t think
I<i>'</i>m very likely to beetle.

1195
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:07,676
I<i>'</i>m sort of a fixture here,

1196
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:11,275
like sinks and door handles
and things.

1197
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:15,433
Well, just you remember
that no one can get on without them.

1198
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:18,317
- Good night.
- Night.

1199
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:28,072
Simon!

1200
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:32,558
(Light knock)

1201
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:41,075
- 0h, what is it?
- Casualty case, Doctor. Male.

1202
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:44,596
Intermittent abdominal pains.
Severe at times.

1203
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,914
- Does he look ill?
- No, came in a taxi.

1204
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,434
0h, what time is it?

1205
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:54,637
Half past three.
Raining like blazes outside.

1206
01:20:55,560 --> 01:21:00,270
- Ah, Doctor.
- Good morning. What<i>'</i>s the trouble?

1207
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:03,557
Sorry to bother you, Doctor.
Pascoe<i>'</i>s the name.

1208
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:06,712
- I<i>'</i>ve interrupted your repose.
- No. Sit down.

1209
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:10,998
I said to myself, "The Doctor<i>'</i>s
well in the arms of Morpheus.

1210
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:14,755
- "Enjoying the sleep of the just."
- Do sit down.

1211
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:19,596
- Are we quite alone, Doctor?
- Er, yes, yes.

1212
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:22,672
- Do you know Sir Lancelot Spratt?
- Yes, very well.

1213
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:26,435
Sir Lancelot operated on me recently.
Partial gastrectomy.

1214
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:27,873
- You know.
- Yes.

1215
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:32,795
All was well until a few days ago.
Then I began to have pains.

1216
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,836
This evening, at supper,

1217
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:38,356
I coughed and suddenly felt something
in my mouth.

1218
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:41,034
- It was a nut.
- You<i>'</i>d been eating nuts?

1219
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,792
0h, no. It was a metal nut.

1220
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:47,032
A little later, I brought up
more nuts and bit of a spring.

1221
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:50,669
I<i>'</i>ve been bringing up pieces
of old iron all night.

1222
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:54,594
Mr Pascoe, this is almost impossible.
Are you quite sure?

1223
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:56,910
Doctor, look.

1224
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:04,953
Looks like a nut
from a surgical retractor.

1225
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:09,272
Yes. I heard a rumour that something
was missing after my operation.

1226
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:12,555
Could I have a look at your stomach?

1227
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:18,672
Yes, you<i>'</i>ve got a fresh scar there.

1228
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:22,478
- This could be very serious.
- That<i>'</i>s why I came.

1229
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:25,028
I<i>'</i>m not the kind to go to the law,

1230
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:28,635
but if anything happened,
I have so many relatives.

1231
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:33,589
0h, it is possible, I suppose.
I don<i>'</i>t remember the case offhand,

1232
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:36,672
but I had a new theatre sister
about that time.

1233
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:39,877
You<i>'</i>re quite sure
it<i>'</i>s bits of a retractor?

1234
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:42,315
All right, then. I<i>'</i>ll come in.

1235
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:45,631
Get the theatre ready
for an emergency laparotomy.

1236
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:49,429
0h, and Sparrow,
you were quite right to telephone me.

1237
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:58,637
Yes, those are bits of a retractor,
all right.

1238
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:03,996
Well, my man. We<i>'</i>ll have to see
how many other parts are inside you.

1239
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:09,234
Yes, Doctor. Shall I show you what
came up while I was lying here alone?

1240
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:12,278
- Something else?
- Yes. Yes.

1241
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:15,835
This.

1242
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,992
"Is this a dagger I see before me?"

1243
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:23,117
Macbeth. Shakespeare.
Yes, Shakespeare.

1244
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:26,430
(Laughs maniacally)

1245
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,752
Well, this is my research.

1246
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:35,559
Keep it quiet.
I don<i>'</i>t want it to get about.

1247
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:38,757
- (Bird screeches)
- Seems like a losing battle.

1248
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:41,513
- What<i>'</i>s this caviar doing?
- Good question.

1249
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:45,832
That<i>'</i>s the whole point. I<i>'</i>m
experimenting with the effect of diet

1250
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:50,038
on pigmentation - colour -
of skin, fur and plumage.

1251
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:52,998
They look well on it
but I can<i>'</i>t think why.

1252
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:55,275
- Enzymes, old boy.
- What?

1253
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:59,638
Might throw light on human
dermatography and genetic practices.

1254
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:01,676
- What?
- Breeding.

1255
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,991
Quite. Most of them
are responding pretty well,

1256
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:08,834
but these two
are presenting a bit of a poser.

1257
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:11,912
- Why? And what are they?
- Chameleons.

1258
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,231
- Interesting, eh?
- Very, if you like chameleons.

1259
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:19,199
Yes, I rather fancy Sir Lancelot
will be pretty impressed.

1260
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:21,236
All helps, eh?

1261
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:25,313
By the way, that was a bit of a boob
with the loony, old man.

1262
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:29,359
Dr Sparrow here?
Blimey, pet<i>'</i>s corner, eh?

1263
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:32,398
- You<i>'</i>re wanted in Casualty.
- All right.

1264
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:36,996
Er... Have them X-rayed first
this time, old man.

1265
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:43,473
Poor Sparrow. Always boobing.

1266
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:47,515
Come in. It<i>'</i>s a bit more cosy.

1267
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:53,314
- Do sit down, Mrs...?
- Mrs Dalton.

1268
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:55,595
Mrs Dalton. Do sit down, will you?

1269
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:59,070
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

1270
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:04,590
Now, then.
Tell me what worries you.

1271
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:10,150
They... they say
they want to operate on me.

1272
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:12,151
Do they?

1273
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:15,710
Yes. I<i>'</i>m scared.

1274
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:18,678
Well, there<i>'</i>s really no need to be,
you know.

1275
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:23,276
Everyone here<i>'</i>s very kind
and understanding.

1276
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:26,193
Why don<i>'</i>t you tell me all about it?

1277
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:30,516
Well, it started
about five years ago,

1278
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:32,636
just after my husband died.

1279
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:35,518
- I<i>'</i>ll cut through Casualty.
- Good night.

1280
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:38,956
By the way, that chap Bingham,
what do you think of him?

1281
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:42,157
- He<i>'</i>s a very clever chap.
- Yes, I suppose he is.

1282
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:46,074
But I<i>'</i>m inclined to wonder
whether he<i>'</i>s in charge or I am.

1283
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:48,879
- Good night, George.
- Good night, sir.

1284
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:53,232
I see what<i>'</i>s worrying you,
and I understand.

1285
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:56,949
- Who<i>'</i>s doing the operation?
- Sir Lancelot Spratt.

1286
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:59,110
- Sir Lancelot?
- Do you know him?

1287
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:01,395
- Yes, very well.
- What<i>'</i>s he like?

1288
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:05,632
You<i>'</i>re very lucky. He<i>'</i>s one
of the best surgeons in the country.

1289
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:09,429
We<i>'</i>re very proud of him here.
Mind you, he<i>'</i>s a bit of a bear.

1290
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:13,354
He growls a bit but
you mustn<i>'</i>t take any notice of that.

1291
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:15,829
You couldn<i>'</i>t be in more secure hands.

1292
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:18,434
0h, that does make me feel better.

1293
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:23,076
- But...
- But what?

1294
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:25,310
Well, there is another thing...

1295
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:29,955
My sister, you see.
She had an operation.

1296
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:34,158
All the doctors said it was going
to be all right but it wasn<i>'</i>t.

1297
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:38,552
- She was ill long after.
- Complications can arise sometimes,

1298
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:40,596
things that no one can foresee.

1299
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:44,468
- Have you ever made a mistake?
- Who me? 0h, Lord, yes.

1300
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:48,519
There was chap last night.
Came in just like you, a bit late.

1301
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:52,513
Said he was bringing up
nuts and bolts.

1302
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:57,435
He was a crank. I got bawled out
but you see, he might<i>'</i>ve been right.

1303
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:00,592
He might have been ill.
I couldn<i>'</i>t take a chance.

1304
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:06,470
You know, I don<i>'</i>t know why
anyone becomes a doctor or a nurse.

1305
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:09,438
All that responsibility.

1306
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:13,877
Well, you know, Mrs Dalton,
I<i>'</i>ve often wondered that myself.

1307
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:16,474
There are easier ways
to earn a living.

1308
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:21,156
It<i>'</i>s not for the glamour
and it<i>'</i>s certainly not for the money.

1309
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:24,676
No, I think it<i>'</i>s because
they feel that...

1310
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:29,709
the most precious thing
we have on this earth is life,

1311
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:34,316
and nothing<i>'</i>s more important than to
help people get their full share.

1312
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:39,520
- That<i>'</i>s why you became a doctor?
- Who, me? I<i>'</i>d like to think so.

1313
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:42,558
As a matter of fact,
I wanted to be a surgeon,

1314
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:44,915
but I don<i>'</i>t think I ever shall now.

1315
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,834
So I<i>'</i>ve just got to be good
as a different sort of doctor.

1316
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:50,751
- A cup of tea?
- 0h, yes.

1317
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:52,910
I<i>'</i>ll go ask Harry to put some on.

1318
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:57,278
I<i>'</i>d have thought it would be more
interesting to research rarer things,

1319
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:02,195
like, oh, I don<i>'</i>t know...
elephants, for instance.

1320
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:05,716
You sometimes get a white elephant,
don<i>'</i>t you? Why?

1321
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:07,756
That<i>'</i>s a point.

1322
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:12,072
How would one get information
on elephant diet and... practices?

1323
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:16,711
From a zoo, I imagine, or a circus.
I expect they keep records.

1324
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:19,155
Would you like me
to find out for you?

1325
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:22,118
Would you?
As you can see, I<i>'</i>m pretty busy.

1326
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:24,475
- Yes, all right.
- Good girl.

1327
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:26,915
Ask for all they<i>'</i>ve got on elephants.

1328
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,560
All they<i>'</i>ve got on elephants. Yes.

1329
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:33,349
Mention Sir Lancelot.
That<i>'</i>ll impress them.

1330
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:35,953
Elephants.

1331
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:43,271
I want a report on that gastrectomy.
I<i>'</i>m not quite satisfied with it.

1332
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:46,670
- Yes, sir.
- No lack of punctuality. Well?

1333
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:50,673
Excuse me, guv<i>'</i>nor. Where can I find
a bloke called Spratt?

1334
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:53,916
I am a bloke called Spratt.

1335
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,037
- I<i>'</i>ve got something for you, sir.
- What?

1336
01:28:57,120 --> 01:29:01,636
Come on the instructions
of a gent called Bingham, for you.

1337
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,676
Where is it?

1338
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:16,878
(Trumpets)

1339
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,389
(Trumpeting)

1340
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:35,672
0h, no! I asked for
all they<i>'</i>d got on elephants,

1341
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:37,716
not all the elephants they<i>'</i>d got!

1342
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:40,678
(Trumpets)

1343
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:42,716
(Laughter)

1344
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:48,397
- Dr Bingham!
- Coming, sir. Sir Lancelot...

1345
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:51,233
- What is the meaning of this?
- Sir, I...

1346
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:54,517
- Is this your idea of a joke?
- No, sir. It was...

1347
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:58,593
Dr Bingham, they assure me
that elephants never forget.

1348
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:02,639
Allow me to assure you,
neither do consultant surgeons.

1349
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:04,676
Good day to you.

1350
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:06,910
(Elephant trumpets)

1351
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,230
- Hello, Joy.
- Hello, Tony.

1352
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:12,278
Well, why so glum?
Where are you off to?

1353
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:14,635
To Spratt, to get the sack.

1354
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:17,473
- Join me.
- You<i>'</i>ve got another job already?

1355
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:21,519
Private personal physician
to the Maharajah of Branda.

1356
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:24,194
I<i>'</i>m starting a clinic for his girls.

1357
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:27,909
Well, if you need any elephants,
Joy has a contact.

1358
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:31,515
By the way, I<i>'</i>ve given Lady Howkins<i>'</i>
15,000 to St Swithin<i>'</i>s.

1359
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:34,672
Tell them to stuff...
some pillows with it.

1360
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:38,514
(Growls) That<i>'</i>s nice, isn<i>'</i>t it?
See you in the pub.

1361
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:41,717
That<i>'</i>s old Benskin fixed up.
Heaven help India.

1362
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:43,153
What<i>'</i>ll you do now?

1363
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:47,028
Go back to GP, end up in
Middlesbrough with feet and ringworm.

1364
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:49,589
- Someone<i>'</i>s got to do it.
- Be you soon.

1365
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:51,193
- No, it won<i>'</i>t.
- What?

1366
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:54,750
- You were right. I<i>'</i>ve given up.
- Joy!

1367
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:57,149
My student days are over.

1368
01:30:57,240 --> 01:31:00,471
What will you do?
Go back to nursing or something?

1369
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:04,155
I might.
I think I<i>'</i>ve rather lost the thing.

1370
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:07,835
I<i>'</i>m a bit sick of hospitals.
I might do private nursing.

1371
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:11,435
Some old rich woman
eating her head off in Monte Carlo.

1372
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:13,476
That would be fun.

1373
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:16,711
Palm trees, sunshine,
Greek millionaires...

1374
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:20,554
- Somehow they don<i>'</i>t appeal to me.
- You must be dotty.

1375
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:23,632
What on earth<i>'</i>s the matter
with Monte Carlo?

1376
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:26,553
It<i>'</i>s too far from Middlesbrough.

1377
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:28,915
I<i>'</i>ll wait for you in the hall.

1378
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:32,951
- (Knock)
- Come.

1379
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:43,433
Dr Sparrow, I do not enjoy being
hauled out of bed at 3am,

1380
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:47,513
made to drive through a cloudburst
to see a sicked-up surgical saw.

1381
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:50,273
I understand, Sir Lancelot.
I apologise.

1382
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:52,032
I do not accept your apology.

1383
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:55,749
This is not the first time
our paths have crossed unhappily.

1384
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:58,434
- No, sir.
- Then, let<i>'</i>s ensure it is the last.

1385
01:31:58,520 --> 01:32:01,830
I assume you mean
my dismissal from the hospital?

1386
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:06,516
A not unnatural assumption.
I hear you<i>'</i>re interested in surgery.

1387
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:09,353
What makes you think
your gifts lie there?

1388
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:13,911
Some may say that a nuts
and bolts factory is more suitable

1389
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,831
than an operating theatre.

1390
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:18,480
0r have you
what is called a vocation?

1391
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:22,189
Yes, I have. I have a vocation,
if that<i>'</i>s what you call it,

1392
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:25,477
and one day I<i>'</i>ll prove it,
though I shan<i>'</i>t have a title

1393
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:28,677
and a conceit as big
as my backside to advertise it!

1394
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:31,433
You<i>'</i>re being remarkably insulting.

1395
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:35,115
And I<i>'</i>m thoroughly enjoying it.
And I don<i>'</i>t apologise.

1396
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:40,194
And I<i>'</i>d have thought it might be
an interesting clinical experience

1397
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:42,999
for you to be
on the receiving end for once.

1398
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:45,435
Good morning.

1399
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:48,432
0h, Dr Sparrow, one further thing.

1400
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:50,750
I do not growl like a bear...

1401
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:53,479
I ROAR LIKE A LION! GET OUT!

1402
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:00,272
(Buzzer)

1403
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:06,395
Spratt. 0h, yes, Sister.
I<i>'</i>ll be along in a minute.

1404
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:09,677
Get <i>'</i>em lined up,
and see the tools are sharp.

1405
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:12,069
Where do we go now?

1406
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:17,029
To the pub to find me a drink
and then to find me a job.

1407
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:23,950
Dr Sparrow, put that
wretched woman down. Gentlemen.

1408
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:26,793
Where the devil do you think
you<i>'</i>re going?

1409
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:30,634
To get myself a ruddy great drink.
Then I<i>'</i>m going to get a job.

1410
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:34,315
That<i>'</i>s the wrong direction.
The operating theatre<i>'</i>s this way.

1411
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:36,595
I<i>'</i>m going this way.

1412
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:38,830
- What for?
- To get married!

1413
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:42,390
You can<i>'</i>t get married today.
You<i>'</i>ll have to put it off.

1414
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:45,631
If you want to be a surgeon,
you<i>'</i>d better start now.

1415
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:52,995
The first thing you do
is order a respectable suit.

1416
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:55,150
- Simon?
- What?

1417
01:33:55,240 --> 01:33:58,118
- Who are you going to marry?
- What?

1418
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:00,236
Well, you, of course.

1419
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:05,998
- Unless you<i>'</i>ve any objections?
- Dr Sparrow, I<i>'</i>m waiting.

1420
01:34:06,305 --> 01:34:12,929
