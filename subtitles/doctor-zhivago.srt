2
00:07:59,821 --> 00:08:01,516
What are they like, these girls?

3
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:06,492
They're very good. A bit wild.
Spend their money quickly. Work hard.

4
00:08:06,561 --> 00:08:08,586
- Are they literate?
- Some of them.

5
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,696
In and out of reformatories
from the day they were picked up.

6
00:08:11,766 --> 00:08:14,166
Jobs like this. It's degrading.

7
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:17,029
They shouldn't use human beings
to move earth.

8
00:08:17,138 --> 00:08:18,036
No.

9
00:08:18,173 --> 00:08:19,731
And it's not efficient.

10
00:08:19,841 --> 00:08:21,900
If they were to give me
two more excavators...

11
00:08:21,976 --> 00:08:23,534
...I'd be a year ahead of the plan by now.

12
00:08:23,611 --> 00:08:25,306
You're an impatient generation.

13
00:08:25,413 --> 00:08:26,402
Weren't you?

14
00:08:26,514 --> 00:08:28,414
Yes, we were. Very.

15
00:08:29,351 --> 00:08:33,617
Don't be too impatient, Comrade Engineer,
we've come very far, very fast.

16
00:08:33,688 --> 00:08:35,212
Yes, I know that, Comrade General.

17
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,850
Yes, but do you know what it cost?

18
00:08:39,027 --> 00:08:41,894
There were children in those days
who lived off human flesh.

19
00:08:41,963 --> 00:08:43,055
Did you know that?

20
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,870
What is your interest in this girl,
Comrade General?

21
00:08:56,177 --> 00:08:57,769
She may be my brother's child.

22
00:08:57,846 --> 00:08:59,541
- Yuri Andreyevich?
- Yes.

23
00:09:00,682 --> 00:09:02,877
My half-brother, I should say.

24
00:09:04,052 --> 00:09:05,451
If she is...

25
00:09:05,987 --> 00:09:08,319
...she's also Lara's child.

26
00:09:10,392 --> 00:09:11,723
The Lara?

27
00:09:13,161 --> 00:09:14,492
The Lara, yes.

28
00:09:16,131 --> 00:09:20,830
This is a new edition of the "Lara Poems."

29
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:24,598
Yes, I know.
We admire your brother very much.

30
00:09:24,706 --> 00:09:27,300
Yes, everybody seems to, now.

31
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,905
Well, we couldn't admire him
when we weren't allowed to read him.

32
00:09:32,747 --> 00:09:33,771
No.

33
00:09:49,564 --> 00:09:50,792
Come in.

34
00:09:56,204 --> 00:09:57,899
I sent for you, Comrade.

35
00:09:58,907 --> 00:10:00,602
You're not in any trouble.

36
00:10:12,353 --> 00:10:15,322
I'm General Yevgraf Andreyevich Zhivago.

37
00:10:17,225 --> 00:10:18,886
I'm looking for someone.

38
00:10:20,261 --> 00:10:21,956
Do you understand?

39
00:10:25,633 --> 00:10:28,602
The person I'm looking for
would be my niece.

40
00:10:32,874 --> 00:10:34,239
Please sit down.

41
00:10:37,312 --> 00:10:38,574
Your name is...

42
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,944
Tonya Komarova, Comrade General.

43
00:10:41,382 --> 00:10:43,441
They found you in Mongolia, didn't they?

44
00:10:44,552 --> 00:10:47,350
- Yes, Comrade General.
- What were you doing there?

45
00:10:47,422 --> 00:10:48,946
I was lost, Comrade General.

46
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,014
How did you come to be lost?

47
00:10:51,826 --> 00:10:52,850
I've forgotten.

48
00:10:52,927 --> 00:10:55,191
Was Komarovsky your father's name?

49
00:10:55,296 --> 00:10:57,287
I suppose so, Comrade General.

50
00:10:57,432 --> 00:10:58,865
You suppose so?

51
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:00,734
It's a common name.

52
00:11:00,835 --> 00:11:02,769
Do you remember your father?

53
00:11:03,104 --> 00:11:04,162
No.

54
00:11:05,106 --> 00:11:07,336
Do you remember your mother?

55
00:11:07,942 --> 00:11:10,410
Yes, I remember my mother.

56
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:12,202
What was her name?

57
00:11:13,014 --> 00:11:14,106
"Mammy."

58
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:18,375
What was she like?
I mean, what did she look like?

59
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,547
Big.

60
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,515
Big?

61
00:11:23,258 --> 00:11:26,523
I was little. She looked big.

62
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:35,998
- Can you read?
- Yes.

63
00:11:37,438 --> 00:11:41,431
"Lara. A Cycle of Poems, by Y.A. Zhivago."

64
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:44,303
Not me. My half-brother.

65
00:11:46,548 --> 00:11:48,709
The person I'm looking for...

66
00:11:49,984 --> 00:11:52,077
...would be this man's daughter.

67
00:11:56,558 --> 00:11:58,253
This would be her mother.

68
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:02,722
"Lara."

69
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,098
Did anybody ever call your mother Lara?

70
00:12:08,903 --> 00:12:11,872
I don't know. I don't think so.

71
00:12:15,343 --> 00:12:16,571
She's nice.

72
00:12:19,013 --> 00:12:21,413
I'm not your niece, Comrade General.

73
00:12:21,983 --> 00:12:23,951
Well, I'm nobody's idea of an uncle.

74
00:12:24,018 --> 00:12:27,419
But if this man were my father,
I should want to know.

75
00:12:27,989 --> 00:12:30,890
Did your mother ever tell you
your father was a poet?

76
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,086
Comrade General, my father wasn't a poet.

77
00:12:33,161 --> 00:12:34,719
What was your father?

78
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,225
Not a poet.

79
00:12:40,935 --> 00:12:42,766
Did you like your father?

80
00:12:43,338 --> 00:12:44,532
I've forgotten.

81
00:12:44,606 --> 00:12:46,733
But you liked your mother?

82
00:12:47,342 --> 00:12:48,809
Yes, of course.

83
00:12:52,246 --> 00:12:55,682
Does the name "Strelnikov"
mean anything to you? "Strelnikov"?

84
00:12:58,853 --> 00:13:00,115
"Varykino"?

85
00:13:00,788 --> 00:13:02,949
That's a place, not a person.

86
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:05,323
"Gromeko"?

87
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,289
- Gromeko?
- Yes.

88
00:13:09,964 --> 00:13:11,295
You see...

89
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:14,101
...he lost his mother...

90
00:13:14,469 --> 00:13:16,699
...at about the same age you were...

91
00:13:17,438 --> 00:13:20,839
...when your mother lost you.

92
00:13:23,878 --> 00:13:26,108
And, in the same part of the world.

93
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:57,968
Now is life's artful triumph
of vanities destroyed...

94
00:14:58,306 --> 00:15:01,332
...for the spirit has vanished
from its tabernacle...

95
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:03,237
...its clay groweth black.

96
00:15:03,478 --> 00:15:07,539
The vessel is shattered, voiceless,
emotionless, dead.

97
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:12,017
Committing which unto the grave,
let us beseech the Lord...

98
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:16,245
...that He will give her eternal rest.

99
00:16:25,092 --> 00:16:26,184
Yuri?

100
00:16:57,358 --> 00:17:00,191
You and your husband will dine with us,
Madame Gromeko.

101
00:17:00,294 --> 00:17:01,659
Thank you, Father.

102
00:17:04,298 --> 00:17:06,323
Will you lie down, then, Yuri?

103
00:17:08,836 --> 00:17:11,532
Your mammy and I were great,
great friends, you know...

104
00:17:11,606 --> 00:17:14,439
...so now we are going to look after you.

105
00:17:15,476 --> 00:17:16,738
Thank you.

106
00:17:21,382 --> 00:17:22,713
That's mother's.

107
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,384
It's yours now.

108
00:17:24,485 --> 00:17:26,350
Yes, Yuri. Mammy left it to you.

109
00:17:26,721 --> 00:17:28,018
In her will.

110
00:17:28,155 --> 00:17:30,919
Do you know what a will is, old chap?

111
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,483
Money.

112
00:17:33,361 --> 00:17:36,956
No, Yuri, just this.
Your daddy has all the money.

113
00:17:37,331 --> 00:17:39,094
Can you play it?

114
00:17:40,134 --> 00:17:42,932
I thought all the people in this part
of the world could play the balalaika.

115
00:17:43,004 --> 00:17:45,165
You don't live here, do you?

116
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:46,638
No, we live in Moscow.

117
00:17:46,707 --> 00:17:49,801
That's a long way from here,
but you will like Moscow.

118
00:17:50,578 --> 00:17:52,205
- Won't he?
- In a bit.

119
00:17:52,313 --> 00:17:54,907
It takes time
to get used to things, doesn't it?

120
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:56,913
Mother could play it.

121
00:17:57,885 --> 00:18:00,683
Well, your mother was an artist, Yuri.

122
00:18:01,155 --> 00:18:05,592
She could make this common
little instrument sound like two guitars.

123
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,723
Your mother had a gift.

124
00:18:07,828 --> 00:18:09,625
Perhaps Yuri's got a gift.

125
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,128
Would you like lessons?

126
00:18:11,198 --> 00:18:12,722
I can't play it.

127
00:18:18,072 --> 00:18:19,903
Say good night to Yuri, Tonya.

128
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,969
He's your brother, now.

129
00:18:29,517 --> 00:18:30,950
Good night, Yuri.

130
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,009
Good night, old chap.

131
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,348
Good night.

132
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,356
The Gromekos didn't know
what to make of him.

133
00:19:51,866 --> 00:19:55,267
He made his reputation as a poet
while he was studying to be a doctor.

134
00:19:55,836 --> 00:19:58,862
He said that poetry was no more
of a vocation than good health.

135
00:19:59,507 --> 00:20:01,338
What he needed was a job.

136
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,564
Pretty?

137
00:20:03,377 --> 00:20:04,366
Very.

138
00:20:08,783 --> 00:20:11,877
Yeah. It's their right to be pretty.

139
00:20:14,055 --> 00:20:15,920
What will you do next year, Zhivago?

140
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,855
I thought of doing general practice.

141
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,018
Think about doing pure research.

142
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,661
It's exciting, important, tender, beautiful.

143
00:20:23,164 --> 00:20:24,358
General practice.

144
00:20:24,498 --> 00:20:26,932
Life. He wants to see life. Well...

145
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:31,037
You'll find that pretty creatures
do ugly things to people.

146
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:09,934
What's your name?

147
00:22:11,405 --> 00:22:12,372
Antipov.

148
00:22:12,439 --> 00:22:13,463
Address?

149
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,031
15 Patrofka.

150
00:22:15,242 --> 00:22:16,334
I'll have these.

151
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,970
We have permission
from the chief of police.

152
00:22:19,513 --> 00:22:21,777
- Well, you claim them at the station.
- When?

153
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:24,044
Now if you like.

154
00:22:24,151 --> 00:22:25,379
Very well.

155
00:22:26,253 --> 00:22:27,652
He's my brother.

156
00:22:28,989 --> 00:22:32,425
Well, take him home, Miss.
Before he gets into trouble.

157
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:40,466
Pasha, please!

158
00:22:40,534 --> 00:22:42,195
It's got to be done.

159
00:22:42,336 --> 00:22:44,099
Pasha, why has it got to be done?

160
00:22:44,171 --> 00:22:46,264
For them. For the Revolution.

161
00:22:47,141 --> 00:22:50,008
- Pasha, they don't want a revolution.
- Yes, they do.

162
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,011
They don't know it yet,
but that's what they want.

163
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,740
Give me some of those, Comrade.

164
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,843
Pasha, are you a Bolshevik?

165
00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:02,386
No. The Bolsheviks don't like me.
And I don't like them.

166
00:23:02,856 --> 00:23:04,619
They don't know right from wrong.

167
00:23:04,725 --> 00:23:07,694
Pasha Antipov, you're an awful prig.

168
00:23:13,901 --> 00:23:16,028
Why did you tell him I was your brother?

169
00:23:16,704 --> 00:23:19,036
Well, what else could I have told him?

170
00:23:19,139 --> 00:23:21,801
You could have told him I was your fiance.

171
00:23:22,076 --> 00:23:24,237
Pasha, don't be silly. I'm...

172
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:32,476
Monsieur Komarovsky has come to see
my mother on business.

173
00:23:33,988 --> 00:23:35,888
People gossip around here.

174
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,480
It's the system, Lara.

175
00:23:37,658 --> 00:23:40,149
People will be different
after the Revolution.

176
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:43,456
Will you come?

177
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:44,895
No, Pasha.

178
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,559
I've got exams to take, Pasha.
I've got to get my scholarship.

179
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,194
Hello, Auntie.

180
00:24:18,132 --> 00:24:19,861
There's a letter for you.

181
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,467
From Paris.

182
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:25,094
Lovely writing.

183
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,764
She's coming home next month.

184
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,502
Tonya? Oh, that's good!

185
00:24:38,452 --> 00:24:40,750
He does seem to be very well informed.

186
00:24:41,121 --> 00:24:43,351
And such a handsome figure of...

187
00:24:43,924 --> 00:24:46,154
Good evening, Mama. Madame.

188
00:24:46,327 --> 00:24:47,624
Larissa.

189
00:24:47,928 --> 00:24:51,261
You can work in there, dear.
Monsieur Komarovsky's here.

190
00:25:11,251 --> 00:25:12,741
Good evening, Larissa.

191
00:25:13,687 --> 00:25:15,120
Good evening, Monsieur.

192
00:25:21,028 --> 00:25:23,292
He advises some very important people.

193
00:25:23,364 --> 00:25:24,626
Yes, I know.

194
00:25:24,698 --> 00:25:26,757
I believe he has government connections.

195
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:28,495
I don't know, I'm sure.

196
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:31,260
Isn't he very expensive?

197
00:25:32,306 --> 00:25:35,400
Monsieur Komarovsky advises me
out of kindness, Baroness.

198
00:25:35,676 --> 00:25:37,507
He was a friend of my late husband.

199
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:38,943
Oh, I see.

200
00:25:39,046 --> 00:25:40,206
Allow me.

201
00:26:10,244 --> 00:26:12,371
Tuesday, if I can, my dear. Goodbye.

202
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,788
Where did you get this?

203
00:26:31,865 --> 00:26:33,992
A friend gave it to me,
Monsieur Komarovsky.

204
00:26:34,067 --> 00:26:36,262
You're not to go
to this peaceful demonstration.

205
00:26:36,336 --> 00:26:36,995
No, Monsieur.

206
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,300
It may not be as peaceful as they think.

207
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:42,941
That's all I have to say. Tell your
friend that she's a silly creature.

208
00:26:44,344 --> 00:26:45,675
Yes, Monsieur.

209
00:26:56,924 --> 00:26:58,414
How old are you now?

210
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,084
Seventeen, Monsieur.

211
00:28:16,436 --> 00:28:17,960
A hundred and three.

212
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:20,938
Oh, dear.
And I was so looking forward to it.

213
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:24,937
Oh, never mind. I'll be all right here.

214
00:28:25,379 --> 00:28:28,212
You will take Lara, won't you,
Victor Yppolitovich?

215
00:28:28,315 --> 00:28:31,216
It is so stupid of me!
It's her first long gown.

216
00:28:34,788 --> 00:28:36,813
I think you'd better call it right off.

217
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:38,323
Yes. I'll stay with you.

218
00:28:38,392 --> 00:28:41,486
Nonsense! I'll be perfectly all right.
I've got a book.

219
00:28:41,562 --> 00:28:44,087
It's so disappointing for her,
Victor Yppolitovich.

220
00:28:44,164 --> 00:28:47,759
There's so little opportunity
to mix with good society.

221
00:28:49,503 --> 00:28:51,494
Very well. Get your coat.

222
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,698
We're late, if we're going.

223
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:56,538
I want to avoid Kropotkin Street.

224
00:29:34,414 --> 00:29:38,077
"Brotherhood and freedom."
Yuri, what splendid words.

225
00:29:39,953 --> 00:29:42,251
"Justice, equality and bread."

226
00:29:43,457 --> 00:29:45,288
Don't you think they're splendid?

227
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:46,451
Yes, I do.

228
00:29:47,027 --> 00:29:48,722
"Brotherhood and freedom."

229
00:29:48,795 --> 00:29:52,356
Brotherhood and fiddlesticks!
You're frozen through.

230
00:29:52,733 --> 00:29:55,725
You've no right, Annushka. It isn't fair.

231
00:30:00,941 --> 00:30:02,909
We'd given you up, Monsieur.

232
00:30:03,777 --> 00:30:05,972
My niece. Coat, Lara.

233
00:30:10,751 --> 00:30:12,275
Charmante.

234
00:30:12,719 --> 00:30:13,947
Come, my dear.

235
00:30:41,314 --> 00:30:43,145
How's the Foie de Veau, Gascoigne?

236
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,774
As always, Monsieur.

237
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:47,911
- All right. Not too much...
- Not too much mustard, Monsieur.

238
00:30:50,824 --> 00:30:53,816
- Jambon Farci en Crote.
- Oui, Mademoiselle.

239
00:30:54,961 --> 00:30:56,189
Wine, Monsieur?

240
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:57,963
A little light wine, yes.

241
00:30:58,031 --> 00:30:59,931
Oui, Monsieur. Mademoiselle.

242
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:04,367
This place must be dreadfully expensive,
Monsieur Komarovsky.

243
00:31:06,006 --> 00:31:07,166
It is.

244
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:09,967
Why not "Victor Yppolitovich"?

245
00:31:12,012 --> 00:31:13,104
I can't.

246
00:31:41,208 --> 00:31:42,869
Mother made this dress.

247
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,504
Very nice.

248
00:31:45,479 --> 00:31:47,208
She's clever, isn't she?

249
00:31:47,481 --> 00:31:50,279
Your mother? Yes. Fine little woman.

250
00:32:33,193 --> 00:32:35,923
No doubt they'll sing in tune
after the Revolution.

251
00:33:39,025 --> 00:33:40,219
Prepare!

252
00:34:03,016 --> 00:34:04,040
Mount!

253
00:35:17,691 --> 00:35:19,420
Tote sabers!

254
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:46,435
What, what?

255
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:47,906
What?

256
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,878
- Good night, dear.
- Good night...

257
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,881
...Victor Yppolitovich.

258
00:37:39,165 --> 00:37:41,497
Go inside your houses, please.

259
00:37:41,701 --> 00:37:44,226
All these people will be taken care of.

260
00:37:44,704 --> 00:37:46,228
Go inside, please.

261
00:37:46,573 --> 00:37:49,337
All these people will be taken care of.

262
00:37:49,676 --> 00:37:51,200
Go inside, please.

263
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,878
Get inside.

264
00:38:02,555 --> 00:38:04,716
Yuri, please. No trouble.

265
00:38:05,024 --> 00:38:07,652
Take him inside, sir,
or I'll put him under arrest.

266
00:38:07,794 --> 00:38:11,628
Yuri, I beg you.
Tonya's coming home tomorrow.

267
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,251
Daddy!

268
00:39:48,394 --> 00:39:50,089
There, now, that's enough.

269
00:39:50,964 --> 00:39:53,159
Your mother, your mother.

270
00:39:56,002 --> 00:39:57,094
Mammy!

271
00:40:05,144 --> 00:40:06,873
Mammy, how are you?

272
00:40:08,214 --> 00:40:10,478
Me? Fit as a fiddle.

273
00:40:11,384 --> 00:40:12,817
Turn 'round.

274
00:40:16,189 --> 00:40:18,419
Well, they've taught her something.

275
00:40:27,066 --> 00:40:29,796
- Look at that!
- Isn't Yuri looking well, Tonya?

276
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:32,861
Yes. Well, let's get along, dear.

277
00:40:32,939 --> 00:40:34,873
Yes. Run along, you two.

278
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:43,445
I brought you this. It has a piece in it
about young Russian poets.

279
00:40:43,549 --> 00:40:46,211
Oh, good! Thank you.
Does it mention me?

280
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,350
It begins with you. You're the best.

281
00:40:50,723 --> 00:40:52,918
Very intelligent nation, the French.

282
00:40:53,092 --> 00:40:55,060
They have their heads together.

283
00:40:55,128 --> 00:40:57,255
Yes. They're looking at the paper.

284
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,525
They're head over heels...

285
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,191
Annushka, stop it!

286
00:41:02,101 --> 00:41:05,093
Good marriages are made in Heaven,
or some such place.

287
00:41:14,981 --> 00:41:16,710
Victor Yppolitovich?

288
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,411
I want to talk to you.

289
00:41:23,756 --> 00:41:25,348
No, Pasha.

290
00:41:25,458 --> 00:41:26,982
It's important.

291
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:29,919
All right.

292
00:41:40,273 --> 00:41:41,865
How did you do it?

293
00:41:42,141 --> 00:41:43,335
I didn't.

294
00:41:44,577 --> 00:41:45,908
A Dragoon did.

295
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:49,742
Oh, Pasha, darling!

296
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:51,681
Come, come.

297
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:57,014
- Where's your mother?
- Asleep.

298
00:42:14,807 --> 00:42:17,207
Pasha, I can't deal with this.

299
00:42:17,377 --> 00:42:19,038
Have you got any iodine?

300
00:42:19,145 --> 00:42:20,874
- Yes, but...
- Get it.

301
00:42:34,026 --> 00:42:35,425
Will it hurt?

302
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:39,459
Pasha, darling!

303
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:44,635
Pasha, you must go to a hospital!

304
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,202
I daren't for a day or two.

305
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:52,573
- Will you do something for me?
- Oh, yes. What?

306
00:42:54,247 --> 00:42:55,714
Hide this.

307
00:43:01,053 --> 00:43:02,748
Oh, throw it away!

308
00:43:02,855 --> 00:43:03,822
No.

309
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:07,316
There'll be no more
peaceful demonstrations.

310
00:43:07,894 --> 00:43:10,829
There were women and children, Lara,
and they rode them down.

311
00:43:11,497 --> 00:43:13,988
Starving women asking for bread.

312
00:43:14,167 --> 00:43:18,126
On Tamskaya Avenue, the pigs
were eating and drinking and dancing!

313
00:43:18,771 --> 00:43:20,033
Hide it for me.

314
00:43:24,177 --> 00:43:25,906
Thanks, Comrade.

315
00:43:26,212 --> 00:43:28,737
Pasha, darling, I'm not your comrade.

316
00:43:28,848 --> 00:43:30,008
Lara?

317
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,115
- Yes?
- Who is there?

318
00:43:36,189 --> 00:43:37,850
It's only Pasha.

319
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:42,294
You came in very late last night, dear.

320
00:43:42,395 --> 00:43:44,556
The time went so quickly.

321
00:43:45,031 --> 00:43:46,055
Good.

322
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,861
Are you going to church?

323
00:43:49,268 --> 00:43:50,292
Yes.

324
00:44:01,921 --> 00:44:05,118
You know what our Lord said
to the woman taken in adultery?

325
00:44:05,858 --> 00:44:07,120
Yes, Father.

326
00:44:07,427 --> 00:44:09,327
He said, "Go and sin no more."

327
00:44:09,395 --> 00:44:10,623
And, did she?

328
00:44:11,964 --> 00:44:14,524
- I don't know, Father.
- Nobody does, child.

329
00:44:15,535 --> 00:44:17,298
The flesh is not weak.

330
00:44:17,503 --> 00:44:20,904
It is strong. Only the sacrament
of marriage will contain it.

331
00:44:21,274 --> 00:44:22,502
Remember that.

332
00:44:51,537 --> 00:44:52,663
Monsieur...

333
00:44:53,806 --> 00:44:57,765
It's Number Six, this evening, sir.
The most important person here.

334
00:45:09,455 --> 00:45:10,922
Sorry, I'm late.

335
00:45:11,424 --> 00:45:13,892
I've been waiting nearly an hour, Victor.

336
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:15,591
Have you ordered?

337
00:45:16,429 --> 00:45:17,293
No.

338
00:45:17,396 --> 00:45:19,887
Well, you should have done.

339
00:45:42,188 --> 00:45:43,678
You chose it, Victor.

340
00:45:47,994 --> 00:45:50,121
You've grown up a lot, haven't you?

341
00:45:50,997 --> 00:45:51,986
Yes.

342
00:45:52,265 --> 00:45:54,130
What did you tell your mama tonight?

343
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,565
Victor, don't!

344
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:59,704
- May I smoke?
- Yes, of course.

345
00:46:04,577 --> 00:46:07,740
You like it, don't you? Cigar smoke?

346
00:46:09,615 --> 00:46:11,082
Come along, my dear.

347
00:46:12,518 --> 00:46:13,746
Sant!

348
00:46:14,787 --> 00:46:16,152
Sant!

349
00:46:20,326 --> 00:46:21,657
Drink, drink.

350
00:46:22,461 --> 00:46:24,486
Up, up, up.

351
00:46:41,747 --> 00:46:44,875
Where did you tell her
we were going, your mama?

352
00:46:46,385 --> 00:46:47,716
She didn't ask.

353
00:46:48,087 --> 00:46:50,248
- That's because she knows.
- No, she doesn't.

354
00:46:50,323 --> 00:46:52,848
You'd both take an oath she doesn't.
But she does.

355
00:46:52,925 --> 00:46:54,722
And you both know she does.

356
00:46:54,894 --> 00:46:56,122
Victor, don't!

357
00:46:56,495 --> 00:46:57,359
What?

358
00:46:57,430 --> 00:46:58,590
Torment me.

359
00:46:58,664 --> 00:47:01,997
Torment? Oh, what a little hypocrite it is.

360
00:47:05,171 --> 00:47:06,968
I'm going, now, Victor.

361
00:47:07,573 --> 00:47:09,234
Whatever you like, dear.

362
00:47:12,578 --> 00:47:15,012
You see, you'll always come back.

363
00:47:23,022 --> 00:47:24,319
Stay, darling.

364
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:28,722
Stay.

365
00:48:26,252 --> 00:48:28,584
Wake up! Here, take this.

366
00:48:28,788 --> 00:48:30,949
You show it to someone
if you lose your way.

367
00:48:31,023 --> 00:48:34,322
Professor Boris Kurt. And, you find him.
Now, go on.

368
00:48:35,194 --> 00:48:36,456
Professor Boris Kurt.

369
00:48:52,611 --> 00:48:54,738
But, Boris, this is genius.

370
00:48:54,947 --> 00:48:58,439
Really, I thought it was Rachmaninoff?
I'm going for a smoke.

371
00:49:09,028 --> 00:49:11,258
And how's the general practitioner?

372
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:13,227
A bit scared of his finals.

373
00:49:13,432 --> 00:49:15,423
Well, I don't think he need be.

374
00:49:15,668 --> 00:49:18,933
How do you like the idea of marrying
a general practitioner?

375
00:49:19,472 --> 00:49:22,464
I like it very much.
But no general practitioner has asked me.

376
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:23,371
No?

377
00:49:23,876 --> 00:49:26,071
I thought you nomads were hot-blooded.

378
00:49:26,145 --> 00:49:28,204
A slow lot, these general practitioners.

379
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,805
How do you fancy
a professor of pathology?

380
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:33,040
Does he write poetry?

381
00:49:33,452 --> 00:49:34,646
Alas, no.

382
00:49:35,087 --> 00:49:37,954
Then I'm afraid it's out of the question.
Excuse me.

383
00:49:48,501 --> 00:49:50,594
That's a marvelous girl, Zhivago.

384
00:49:51,504 --> 00:49:52,835
Yes, I'd noticed.

385
00:49:54,673 --> 00:49:56,038
It's for you.

386
00:50:15,227 --> 00:50:18,025
How would the poet like to see
a bit of general practice?

387
00:50:22,134 --> 00:50:25,501
Boris, thank God you've come.
This is very good of you, Boris.

388
00:50:25,571 --> 00:50:27,869
Yes, I know it is. My assistant.

389
00:50:27,973 --> 00:50:29,531
- How do you do?
- Where is she?

390
00:50:29,608 --> 00:50:30,768
This way.

391
00:50:46,158 --> 00:50:47,318
When did she do it?

392
00:50:47,393 --> 00:50:49,486
About eight o'clock this evening.

393
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,899
Do you know what it was?

394
00:51:01,207 --> 00:51:03,004
Why didn't you get a local doctor?

395
00:51:03,075 --> 00:51:05,202
- I couldn't.
- No, I suppose you couldn't.

396
00:51:05,277 --> 00:51:06,369
Come on in.

397
00:51:08,414 --> 00:51:09,745
Turn her over.

398
00:51:15,221 --> 00:51:16,279
All right.

399
00:51:18,824 --> 00:51:19,756
Water.

400
00:51:35,374 --> 00:51:38,275
Now, Yuri. Come on, dear. Come on.

401
00:51:39,378 --> 00:51:40,640
Now, Yuri.

402
00:51:42,348 --> 00:51:43,610
Come on, dear.

403
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:45,574
Come on, Yuri.

404
00:51:45,651 --> 00:51:46,675
Sorry.

405
00:51:48,187 --> 00:51:51,020
Well, my dear, that's it.

406
00:51:51,957 --> 00:51:53,481
That's it. Good.

407
00:51:53,626 --> 00:51:54,684
Good.

408
00:51:55,995 --> 00:51:57,257
Good.

409
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:06,462
Is she going to live?

410
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:09,232
Water.

411
00:52:15,581 --> 00:52:17,708
- She is, isn't she?
- Yes.

412
00:52:19,084 --> 00:52:20,210
Funny thing.

413
00:52:20,286 --> 00:52:23,312
There's a man, speaks on public platforms.

414
00:52:23,622 --> 00:52:27,285
In with the government.
In with the Liberals. In with everybody.

415
00:52:27,593 --> 00:52:29,060
And he risks it all.

416
00:52:29,495 --> 00:52:30,723
For that!

417
00:52:31,797 --> 00:52:33,992
That's not how poets see them, is it?

418
00:52:34,066 --> 00:52:36,000
That's how GPs see them.

419
00:52:36,502 --> 00:52:37,969
That's how they are.

420
00:52:38,971 --> 00:52:41,439
You know, from here, she looks beautiful.

421
00:52:42,074 --> 00:52:44,406
Zhivago, I think you're a hard case.

422
00:52:49,949 --> 00:52:52,918
There's a child in the case.
A child. Her daughter.

423
00:52:52,985 --> 00:52:54,953
Oh, for heaven's sake, Boris...

424
00:52:55,421 --> 00:52:58,447
She might have thought about "Lara"
before she did it.

425
00:52:58,924 --> 00:53:00,118
Does the girl know?

426
00:53:00,192 --> 00:53:01,659
I'm afraid she does.

427
00:53:02,394 --> 00:53:04,191
- Is she here?
- Yes.

428
00:53:05,164 --> 00:53:07,689
Tell her that her mother's going to live.

429
00:53:08,867 --> 00:53:11,301
Wait a minute, Victor. Yurian.

430
00:53:11,537 --> 00:53:12,868
Yes, of course.

431
00:53:15,074 --> 00:53:17,304
What are we going to say about this?

432
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:20,305
- Must we say anything?
- I'm afraid so.

433
00:53:20,379 --> 00:53:23,439
I'm taking her to the hospital.
We'll have to say something.

434
00:53:23,549 --> 00:53:26,040
You know that needn't be difficult, Boris.

435
00:55:58,103 --> 00:56:00,765
- What is the name of your assistant?
- Zhivago.

436
00:56:01,006 --> 00:56:02,234
Andreyevich?

437
00:56:02,307 --> 00:56:04,468
Yes, why? Do you know him?

438
00:56:05,077 --> 00:56:07,443
No, I knew his father slightly.

439
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:08,869
Fine.

440
00:56:18,957 --> 00:56:22,449
Cheer up, Yuri. I'll have the poor bitch
in hospital tonight.

441
00:56:22,661 --> 00:56:24,060
What's his name?

442
00:56:24,997 --> 00:56:27,932
That's Victor Komarovsky.
He says he knows you.

443
00:56:28,267 --> 00:56:30,326
He executed my father's will.

444
00:56:31,003 --> 00:56:32,868
Uncle Alex turned it down.

445
00:56:33,205 --> 00:56:35,605
By Komarovsky's account
there wasn't much in it.

446
00:56:35,674 --> 00:56:37,835
And what there was
belonged to Komarovsky.

447
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:40,003
Oh, he's a very good businessman.

448
00:56:40,512 --> 00:56:42,412
But I doubt that he's crooked.

449
00:56:42,781 --> 00:56:45,249
Very good company. Knows life.

450
00:56:46,418 --> 00:56:48,409
He's had a bad scare tonight.

451
00:57:07,072 --> 00:57:09,666
You don't mind coming here, do you,
Victor Yppolitovich?

452
00:57:09,741 --> 00:57:12,403
No, no. It reminds me of my youth.

453
00:57:15,514 --> 00:57:17,709
- I went to the hospital again.
- And?

454
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:22,311
She wants you to go and forgive her.
For her suspicions.

455
00:57:22,387 --> 00:57:24,787
You can tell her the truth
if you like, Larissa.

456
00:57:31,597 --> 00:57:32,723
Is this him?

457
00:57:32,965 --> 00:57:34,023
Yes.

458
00:57:34,466 --> 00:57:36,366
- He knows nothing about...
- No.

459
00:57:43,008 --> 00:57:45,602
Pasha, this is Monsieur Komarovsky.

460
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,541
Please.

461
00:57:58,624 --> 00:58:00,558
- Will you eat?
- No, thank you.

462
00:58:01,059 --> 00:58:04,256
I hope you don't think this is impertinent,
Pavel Pavlovich.

463
00:58:04,329 --> 00:58:05,353
Not at all.

464
00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:09,059
I am... I have been advising
Larissa's mother for many years.

465
00:58:09,401 --> 00:58:11,266
I'm interested in what happens to her.

466
00:58:11,336 --> 00:58:13,497
There's something I have to tell you.
And that is this:

467
00:58:15,107 --> 00:58:17,405
I am committed to the Revolution.

468
00:58:17,776 --> 00:58:18,936
Nothing...

469
00:58:19,811 --> 00:58:23,474
...not even Lara,
has more importance for me.

470
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:26,983
You misunderstand.

471
00:58:27,719 --> 00:58:29,744
Your political views do not concern me.

472
00:58:29,821 --> 00:58:33,279
So far as that goes, I'm probably
more in sympathy than you suppose.

473
00:58:33,358 --> 00:58:36,521
I have a few contacts of my own,
which might surprise you.

474
00:58:37,162 --> 00:58:38,629
How do you propose to live?

475
00:58:38,697 --> 00:58:40,494
I've been offered a teaching post.

476
00:58:40,565 --> 00:58:43,466
- May I know where?
- Gradov. It's in the Urals.

477
00:58:43,535 --> 00:58:45,833
I know it. Not much of a place.

478
00:58:46,004 --> 00:58:48,438
It's beautiful country,
Monsieur Komarovsky.

479
00:58:48,507 --> 00:58:50,566
It'll be a quiet life, won't it?

480
00:58:50,976 --> 00:58:52,466
That's what we want.

481
00:58:52,611 --> 00:58:56,047
Well, you'll excuse me.
Will your salary be adequate?

482
00:58:56,148 --> 00:58:57,809
Adequate. If not more.

483
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:05,954
Pavel Pavlovich, my chief impression is,
and I mean no offense...

484
00:59:06,491 --> 00:59:08,118
...is that you're very young.

485
00:59:08,193 --> 00:59:10,855
Monsieur Komarovsky,
I hope I don't offend you.

486
00:59:11,029 --> 00:59:12,758
Do people improve with age?

487
00:59:13,398 --> 00:59:15,161
They grow a little more tolerant.

488
00:59:15,233 --> 00:59:17,724
Because they have more
to tolerate in themselves.

489
00:59:17,869 --> 00:59:20,997
If people don't marry young,
what do they bring to their marriage?

490
00:59:21,239 --> 00:59:23,332
A little experience.

491
00:59:23,742 --> 00:59:27,576
I'm 26. My mother died, needlessly,
when I was eight.

492
00:59:27,746 --> 00:59:31,011
My father died in prison.
I have fended for myself.

493
00:59:31,083 --> 00:59:33,779
I've worked my way
through higher school and university.

494
00:59:33,852 --> 00:59:36,912
I am familiar with things
that you can hardly guess at.

495
00:59:37,189 --> 00:59:39,783
All this is an experience
of a kind, certainly.

496
00:59:40,425 --> 00:59:42,950
I've no amorous experience,
if that's what you mean.

497
00:59:43,028 --> 00:59:46,896
None whatever. Lara's 17.
That speaks for itself.

498
00:59:47,833 --> 00:59:50,631
You probably find this situation comic.
We don't.

499
00:59:50,802 --> 00:59:53,202
We're going to be married next year.

500
01:00:00,946 --> 01:00:03,414
I hope I haven't offended you
by speaking plainly.

501
01:00:03,482 --> 01:00:05,074
Not at all. Admirable.

502
01:00:13,658 --> 01:00:15,125
A young crusader.

503
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:16,488
Oh, he's not...

504
01:00:16,561 --> 01:00:19,621
He's a very fine young man.
That's obvious.

505
01:00:20,899 --> 01:00:23,367
You're very generous,
Monsieur Komarovsky.

506
01:00:26,538 --> 01:00:28,529
Larissa, I want to talk to you.

507
01:00:37,949 --> 01:00:39,974
Monsieur Komarovsky, will you...

508
01:00:40,685 --> 01:00:42,312
I beg you.

509
01:00:42,387 --> 01:00:45,754
Drop this affectation of addressing me
as "Monsieur Komarovsky"!

510
01:00:46,057 --> 01:00:49,117
Under the circumstances,
I find it rather ridiculous.

511
01:00:49,327 --> 01:00:53,093
Lara, I am determined to save you
from a dreadful error.

512
01:00:53,632 --> 01:00:57,591
There are two kinds of men, and only two.
And that young man is one kind.

513
01:00:57,702 --> 01:01:00,068
He is high-minded. He is pure.

514
01:01:00,405 --> 01:01:04,466
He is the kind of man that the world
pretends to look up to and despises.

515
01:01:05,310 --> 01:01:09,872
He's the kind of man who breeds
unhappiness, particularly in women.

516
01:01:10,048 --> 01:01:11,413
- Do you understand?
- No.

517
01:01:11,483 --> 01:01:12,677
I think you do.

518
01:01:13,552 --> 01:01:15,144
There's another kind.

519
01:01:15,353 --> 01:01:18,811
Not high-minded. Not pure, but alive.

520
01:01:19,558 --> 01:01:23,688
That your tastes at this time should incline
toward the juvenile is understandable.

521
01:01:23,762 --> 01:01:26,890
But, for you to marry that boy
would be a disaster.

522
01:01:27,165 --> 01:01:29,429
Because, there are two kinds of women.

523
01:01:30,836 --> 01:01:35,068
There are two kinds of women and you,
as we well know, are not the first kind.

524
01:01:39,511 --> 01:01:42,947
You, my dear, are a slut.

525
01:01:44,216 --> 01:01:45,774
I am not!

526
01:01:47,152 --> 01:01:48,380
We'll see.

527
01:02:33,064 --> 01:02:35,589
And, don't delude yourself
that this was rape.

528
01:02:35,667 --> 01:02:37,567
That would flatter us both.

529
01:03:22,747 --> 01:03:24,612
The master's not at home, Miss Lara.

530
01:03:24,683 --> 01:03:25,877
Not at home?

531
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:29,079
No. He went to
the Sventytskis' Christmas party.

532
01:03:31,656 --> 01:03:33,521
Are you going there, Miss?

533
01:03:34,593 --> 01:03:36,493
Please don't say I told you.

534
01:03:36,728 --> 01:03:38,218
No, thank you, Piotr.

535
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:40,455
Merry Christmas, Miss Lara.

536
01:03:41,733 --> 01:03:43,997
Oh, thank you,
and Merry Christmas to you.

537
01:03:50,075 --> 01:03:52,236
Merry Christmas, Yuri Andreyevich.

538
01:04:34,219 --> 01:04:35,584
What's the matter?

539
01:04:39,758 --> 01:04:42,488
We had an appointment this evening.
Where are you going?

540
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:44,790
Haven't you got the letter?
I left a letter...

541
01:04:44,863 --> 01:04:47,229
I've not been home. I'm going home, now.

542
01:04:49,234 --> 01:04:51,998
Where're you going, Lara?
I've a right to know.

543
01:04:52,404 --> 01:04:53,962
What's in this letter?

544
01:04:55,607 --> 01:04:57,199
What's in this letter?

545
01:05:00,712 --> 01:05:01,872
Are you breaking...

546
01:05:01,946 --> 01:05:03,709
- It's all in the letter.
- What is?

547
01:05:03,782 --> 01:05:04,976
Everything.

548
01:05:05,617 --> 01:05:06,777
Don't!

549
01:06:11,783 --> 01:06:14,616
Yuri, there's an extraordinary girl
at this party.

550
01:06:15,086 --> 01:06:16,986
I know. I'm dancing with her.

551
01:06:19,457 --> 01:06:21,084
You're keen tonight, Victor.

552
01:06:21,159 --> 01:06:22,490
I like to win.

553
01:06:22,894 --> 01:06:23,952
Silence!

554
01:06:24,095 --> 01:06:27,223
Silence, everybody! Silence, please!

555
01:06:28,066 --> 01:06:31,229
I have a very delightful announcement
to make.

556
01:06:34,038 --> 01:06:35,596
Oh, Madame Sventytski!

557
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:37,068
Yes. Why not?

558
01:06:38,309 --> 01:06:41,369
I have to announce that Dr. Yuri Zhivago...

559
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:44,976
Doctor Zhivago,
he came third in all Moscow.

560
01:06:47,619 --> 01:06:49,712
Now, listen, please!

561
01:06:49,888 --> 01:06:52,413
Dr. Zhivago is betrothed in marriage to...

562
01:07:15,914 --> 01:07:17,438
My dear Victor!

563
01:07:18,783 --> 01:07:20,011
My dear man!

564
01:07:20,218 --> 01:07:21,480
Get her out.

565
01:07:22,053 --> 01:07:23,042
What?

566
01:07:23,154 --> 01:07:25,520
Get her out. Get her out!

567
01:07:26,090 --> 01:07:28,058
Yes. Yes. I'll get the police.

568
01:07:28,126 --> 01:07:29,150
No!

569
01:07:29,627 --> 01:07:31,458
I don't want you to get the police.

570
01:07:32,130 --> 01:07:35,293
I do not want the police.
I just want you to get her out!

571
01:07:54,152 --> 01:07:55,380
Let her go!

572
01:08:19,811 --> 01:08:20,800
Please!

573
01:08:20,912 --> 01:08:23,506
Quiet, please. Please. Give way.

574
01:08:23,581 --> 01:08:25,549
Please, would you mind?

575
01:08:26,618 --> 01:08:28,813
Would you mind? Thank you, thank you.

576
01:08:41,499 --> 01:08:43,865
Our destinies seem to be interwoven,
don't they?

577
01:08:43,935 --> 01:08:44,833
Yes.

578
01:08:45,570 --> 01:08:47,800
I was a close friend of your father.

579
01:08:48,539 --> 01:08:50,769
I knew you were his business partner.

580
01:08:50,842 --> 01:08:54,073
Rather more than that.
I was present at his death.

581
01:08:56,347 --> 01:08:58,815
Also, I am in contact with your brother.

582
01:08:59,517 --> 01:09:00,279
Yevgraf?

583
01:09:00,351 --> 01:09:03,218
I should say I'm in contact with those
who are in contact with him.

584
01:09:03,288 --> 01:09:05,483
Oh, I disagree with Bolshevism.

585
01:09:05,890 --> 01:09:06,948
Thank you.

586
01:09:08,326 --> 01:09:10,226
You seem to know your trade.

587
01:09:10,395 --> 01:09:13,626
But, I can still admire Bolsheviks, as men.

588
01:09:15,366 --> 01:09:17,527
Shall I tell you why?

589
01:09:17,769 --> 01:09:18,827
Yes.

590
01:09:20,838 --> 01:09:22,169
They may win.

591
01:09:25,143 --> 01:09:27,441
I'd like to meet him, Yevgraf.

592
01:09:27,845 --> 01:09:29,813
He sent me a marvelous letter.

593
01:09:30,415 --> 01:09:31,939
He likes my poetry.

594
01:09:32,884 --> 01:09:35,114
That would have pleased your father.

595
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:39,281
Your father was not a bad man, Yuri.
If I may call you Yuri?

596
01:09:39,657 --> 01:09:41,249
I hardly knew him.

597
01:09:42,927 --> 01:09:45,088
You perhaps may not credit this...

598
01:09:46,464 --> 01:09:48,694
...but he was devoted to your mother.

599
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:06,272
I suppose I may continue to rely
on your professional discretion?

600
01:10:10,254 --> 01:10:14,657
You mean, will I tell anyone the truth
about that girl?

601
01:10:15,526 --> 01:10:17,323
That's what I mean, yes.

602
01:10:19,397 --> 01:10:23,527
You may continue to rely
on my professional etcetera.

603
01:10:24,268 --> 01:10:26,259
You are fastidious, aren't you?

604
01:10:27,605 --> 01:10:31,166
What happens to a girl like that,
when a man like you is finished with her?

605
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:33,772
Interested?

606
01:10:34,846 --> 01:10:36,211
I give her to you.

607
01:10:39,517 --> 01:10:42,111
You shouldn't smoke. You've had a shock.

608
01:10:49,193 --> 01:10:51,787
I give her to you, Yuri Andreyevich.

609
01:10:52,930 --> 01:10:54,397
A wedding present.

610
01:12:07,972 --> 01:12:10,031
Where have you seen that girl before?

611
01:12:10,775 --> 01:12:12,902
What makes you think
I've seen her before?

612
01:12:12,977 --> 01:12:14,239
Haven't you?

613
01:12:15,246 --> 01:12:16,941
- Yes.
- Where?

614
01:12:17,515 --> 01:12:20,780
I'm not supposed to say.
It was on a case. Not very nice.

615
01:12:20,952 --> 01:12:23,785
No, don't tell me,
if you're not supposed to say.

616
01:13:03,828 --> 01:13:07,320
In bourgeois terms it was a war
between the Allies and Germany.

617
01:13:07,899 --> 01:13:12,199
In Bolshevik terms it was a war between
the Allied and the German upper classes.

618
01:13:12,637 --> 01:13:15,868
And, which of them won was
a matter of indifference.

619
01:13:33,057 --> 01:13:37,756
I was ordered by the Party to enlist.
I gave my name as Petrov.

620
01:13:38,596 --> 01:13:41,121
They were shouting for victory
all over Europe...

621
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:43,929
...praying for victory, to the same God.

622
01:13:44,769 --> 01:13:49,399
My task, the Party's task,
was to organize defeat.

623
01:13:50,141 --> 01:13:52,609
From defeat would spring the Revolution.

624
01:13:52,677 --> 01:13:55,441
And, the Revolution would be
victory for us.

625
01:13:56,414 --> 01:13:58,905
The Party looked
to the conscript peasants...

626
01:13:59,283 --> 01:14:02,252
...most of them wearing
their first good pair of boots.

627
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:05,589
When the boots wore out,
they'd be ready to listen.

628
01:14:05,957 --> 01:14:09,916
When the time came, I was able to take
3 battalions with me out of the Front Line.

629
01:14:09,994 --> 01:14:12,224
The best day's work I ever did.

630
01:14:12,797 --> 01:14:15,561
But, for the moment,
there was nothing to be done.

631
01:14:15,633 --> 01:14:18,397
There were too many volunteers like me.

632
01:14:18,836 --> 01:14:20,929
Mostly, it was mere hysteria.

633
01:14:21,272 --> 01:14:25,003
But there were men with better motives,
men who saw the times were critical...

634
01:14:25,076 --> 01:14:26,907
...and wanted a man's part.

635
01:14:27,144 --> 01:14:28,736
Good men, wasted.

636
01:14:29,714 --> 01:14:31,272
Unhappy men, too.

637
01:14:31,682 --> 01:14:33,547
Unhappy in their jobs.

638
01:14:34,352 --> 01:14:36,286
Unhappy with their wives.

639
01:14:36,921 --> 01:14:38,650
Doubting themselves.

640
01:14:39,557 --> 01:14:41,525
Happy men don't volunteer.

641
01:14:42,226 --> 01:14:46,322
They wait their turn and thank God
if their age, or work, delays it.

642
01:14:47,398 --> 01:14:51,391
The ones who got back home with
the price of an arm or an eye or a leg...

643
01:14:52,637 --> 01:14:54,969
...these were the lucky ones.

644
01:15:00,211 --> 01:15:01,735
Even Comrade Lenin...

645
01:15:02,146 --> 01:15:06,515
...underestimated both
the anguish of that 900-mile-long front...

646
01:15:07,351 --> 01:15:09,945
...and our cursed capacity for suffering.

647
01:15:12,790 --> 01:15:15,520
By the second winter of the war...

648
01:15:16,027 --> 01:15:17,995
...the boots had worn out...

649
01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:21,093
...but the line still held.

650
01:15:22,166 --> 01:15:25,101
Their great coats fell to pieces
on their backs.

651
01:15:26,137 --> 01:15:28,230
Their rations were irregular.

652
01:15:29,206 --> 01:15:31,868
Half of them went into action
without arms...

653
01:15:32,276 --> 01:15:34,267
...led by men they didn't trust.

654
01:15:34,345 --> 01:15:36,609
Come on, you bastards!

655
01:15:38,149 --> 01:15:39,844
And, those they did trust...

656
01:15:39,917 --> 01:15:41,942
Come on, Comrades. Come on!

657
01:15:42,787 --> 01:15:43,811
Come on!

658
01:15:53,864 --> 01:15:55,297
Come on!

659
01:15:57,802 --> 01:15:58,962
Come on!

660
01:15:59,437 --> 01:16:02,133
Comrades! Earthshakers!

661
01:16:02,406 --> 01:16:04,499
Show them!

662
01:16:06,711 --> 01:16:08,736
Charge!

663
01:16:30,201 --> 01:16:34,501
At last they did what all the armies
dreamed of doing:

664
01:16:35,539 --> 01:16:37,530
They began to go home.

665
01:16:48,052 --> 01:16:50,612
That was the beginning of the Revolution.

666
01:17:15,646 --> 01:17:17,136
Deserters.

667
01:17:17,581 --> 01:17:19,071
Replacements.

668
01:17:31,829 --> 01:17:35,321
Tote arms!

669
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:44,234
Come back.

670
01:17:45,509 --> 01:17:47,238
Stick together!

671
01:17:50,347 --> 01:17:52,645
Stick together and we'll be all right.

672
01:17:53,818 --> 01:17:55,547
And be ready for them.

673
01:18:21,245 --> 01:18:22,610
Turn around, lads!

674
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:25,405
- Don't go any farther.
- Come on, lads. Turn around.

675
01:18:25,483 --> 01:18:27,815
Pigs to the slaughter! Look at you!

676
01:18:28,052 --> 01:18:29,542
Turn around, lads.

677
01:18:51,509 --> 01:18:52,771
Listen, lads.

678
01:18:53,611 --> 01:18:56,011
Ten miles up that road are the Germans!

679
01:18:57,781 --> 01:18:59,646
- Rubbish.
- Not rubbish.

680
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:02,742
They're coming. And they're coming fast.

681
01:19:03,721 --> 01:19:05,313
You've let them in.

682
01:19:07,625 --> 01:19:09,616
They're coming for your wives...

683
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:12,058
...your houses, your country.

684
01:19:12,196 --> 01:19:14,630
Your country, Officer!

685
01:19:15,432 --> 01:19:18,458
Yes, my country! And proud...

686
01:19:33,551 --> 01:19:35,246
Get back in your ranks!

687
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:37,712
Get back in your ranks!

688
01:19:43,527 --> 01:19:44,994
Get back!

689
01:19:47,898 --> 01:19:50,059
Get back in the ranks!

690
01:21:06,143 --> 01:21:07,474
Are you a nurse?

691
01:21:08,312 --> 01:21:09,244
Yes.

692
01:21:09,346 --> 01:21:11,007
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

693
01:21:11,749 --> 01:21:13,148
Then help me.

694
01:21:41,278 --> 01:21:44,645
Doctor, I ought to tell you,
I'm not a trained nurse, I'm a volunteer.

695
01:21:44,715 --> 01:21:45,909
I see. Right.

696
01:21:46,850 --> 01:21:48,442
Why did you volunteer?

697
01:21:49,153 --> 01:21:52,088
- I came here to find my husband.
- Very gently.

698
01:21:52,523 --> 01:21:54,889
- Have you ever seen an operation?
- Yes.

699
01:21:55,059 --> 01:21:56,321
We'll manage.

700
01:22:08,906 --> 01:22:12,398
They're in the next village, brothers.
The Germans.

701
01:22:13,644 --> 01:22:15,339
- Your Honor...
- Keep still.

702
01:22:45,409 --> 01:22:47,343
Did you find your husband?

703
01:22:48,779 --> 01:22:49,768
No.

704
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:51,211
Your Honor...

705
01:22:51,348 --> 01:22:53,009
Yes, we'd better be off.

706
01:23:09,433 --> 01:23:12,368
You know, you often look at me
as though you knew me.

707
01:23:12,569 --> 01:23:15,732
I have seen you.
Four years ago. Christmas Eve.

708
01:23:18,108 --> 01:23:19,666
Were you there?

709
01:23:20,611 --> 01:23:22,306
No wonder you look at me.

710
01:23:24,281 --> 01:23:26,272
Did you know Victor Komarovsky?

711
01:23:26,917 --> 01:23:30,114
Yes, I did. That young man,
who took you away...

712
01:23:30,220 --> 01:23:31,118
My husband.

713
01:23:31,188 --> 01:23:34,351
A lot of courage.
He made the rest of us look very feeble.

714
01:23:34,424 --> 01:23:37,052
As a matter of fact, I thought you both did.

715
01:23:37,394 --> 01:23:39,123
Good man to shoot at.

716
01:23:40,164 --> 01:23:42,564
I'd give anything never to have met him.

717
01:24:12,830 --> 01:24:14,525
The tsar's in prison.

718
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:18,024
Lenin's in Moscow.

719
01:24:19,503 --> 01:24:21,266
Civil war has started.

720
01:24:21,672 --> 01:24:22,639
Good!

721
01:24:22,706 --> 01:24:24,264
Civil war, good?

722
01:24:25,175 --> 01:24:27,370
Not good, Comrade Nurse, inevitable.

723
01:24:29,012 --> 01:24:32,004
But Lenin in Moscow!

724
01:24:32,683 --> 01:24:36,175
This Lenin, will he be the new tsar then?

725
01:24:37,287 --> 01:24:40,723
Listen, Daddy.
No more tsars, no more masters.

726
01:24:41,024 --> 01:24:44,425
Only workers in a worker's state.
How about that?

727
01:24:45,762 --> 01:24:47,252
Are you a doctor?

728
01:24:47,464 --> 01:24:49,159
- Yes.
- Follow me, please.

729
01:25:36,013 --> 01:25:37,947
I can't deal with this.

730
01:25:38,482 --> 01:25:41,974
Order of the Provisional Government.
You'll have to try, friend.

731
01:25:50,127 --> 01:25:52,789
"If you could see how hard
we have been working here...

732
01:25:52,863 --> 01:25:56,321
"...I feel sure you'd forgive me, dear,
for not writing more regularly."

733
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:57,765
When was that written?

734
01:25:57,868 --> 01:25:59,130
July 20th.

735
01:25:59,202 --> 01:26:00,362
Eight weeks!

736
01:26:00,938 --> 01:26:03,634
"But now the war seems
really to have stopped.

737
01:26:03,707 --> 01:26:06,972
"The hospital is emptying,
and I shall have more time.

738
01:26:07,077 --> 01:26:11,411
"I may even get time to write some verse,
if I've not forgotten how to."

739
01:26:12,015 --> 01:26:13,482
Oh, I do hope so!

740
01:26:15,752 --> 01:26:19,313
"Larissa Antipova is still here,
and I admire her more and more.

741
01:26:21,058 --> 01:26:25,427
"She seems to have the strange gift
of healing, which doctors don't believe in.

742
01:26:26,163 --> 01:26:30,099
"She often does the wrong things,
but it always seems to work out right.

743
01:26:31,735 --> 01:26:33,202
"How is Uncle Alex?

744
01:26:33,370 --> 01:26:36,771
- "Can he still get his English tobacco?"
- Would that he could!

745
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:40,003
"Can Sasha say his letters yet?
And how is Auntie Anna?"

746
01:26:41,611 --> 01:26:43,476
He didn't get my letter.

747
01:26:44,648 --> 01:26:47,139
"Most of all, my dearest, how are you?"

748
01:26:47,751 --> 01:26:50,413
Strangely upsetting.
He doesn't know she's dead.

749
01:26:51,688 --> 01:26:53,815
Can't see what difference it makes.

750
01:26:55,192 --> 01:26:56,659
They're at it again!

751
01:26:57,361 --> 01:26:59,852
I wish they'd decide once and for all...

752
01:27:00,464 --> 01:27:05,231
...which gang of hooligans constitutes
the government of this country!

753
01:27:12,075 --> 01:27:13,542
Cheer up, Sergei.

754
01:27:14,411 --> 01:27:16,140
Don't you want to go home?

755
01:27:16,913 --> 01:27:19,780
There's fighting at home, Your Honor.
I've had enough.

756
01:27:20,417 --> 01:27:24,376
Red Guards and White Guards,
this old man's had enough.

757
01:27:25,856 --> 01:27:27,847
Your Honor is a kind gentleman.

758
01:27:30,594 --> 01:27:32,858
And, the nurse is a kind lady.

759
01:27:47,878 --> 01:27:49,038
Finished?

760
01:27:49,279 --> 01:27:50,610
Just about.

761
01:27:59,589 --> 01:28:02,251
In a couple of weeks
you'll be with your little girl.

762
01:28:02,325 --> 01:28:03,986
If I can get on a train.

763
01:28:06,997 --> 01:28:10,160
I want to be with Katya
more than anything in the world.

764
01:28:10,434 --> 01:28:11,696
Yes, of course.

765
01:28:13,203 --> 01:28:15,501
But, now that we're going, I feel sad.

766
01:28:17,674 --> 01:28:18,663
Sad.

767
01:28:20,010 --> 01:28:21,102
Really sad.

768
01:28:21,745 --> 01:28:24,077
- Well, we've been here some time.
- Yes.

769
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:29,241
This must have been a lovely house, once.

770
01:28:30,187 --> 01:28:31,347
Don't you think?

771
01:28:31,421 --> 01:28:33,184
What are you going to do?

772
01:28:33,890 --> 01:28:34,982
In Gradov?

773
01:28:35,058 --> 01:28:36,047
Yes.

774
01:28:37,294 --> 01:28:38,386
I'll be all right.

775
01:28:38,462 --> 01:28:40,123
I wish I could think so.

776
01:28:46,036 --> 01:28:47,697
You could run a laundry.

777
01:28:49,372 --> 01:28:50,862
What will you do?

778
01:28:50,974 --> 01:28:53,306
I suppose I'll go back to the hospital.

779
01:28:54,377 --> 01:28:56,470
It's funny to think of you there.

780
01:29:00,383 --> 01:29:02,715
I used to pass it on my way to school.

781
01:29:04,054 --> 01:29:06,045
Do you ever come to Moscow?

782
01:29:06,289 --> 01:29:07,449
From Gradov?

783
01:29:08,458 --> 01:29:11,052
If only there were someone
to look after you.

784
01:29:11,128 --> 01:29:14,461
Of course, if there were,
I'd be destroyed by jealousy.

785
01:29:14,564 --> 01:29:15,929
Zhivago, don't.

786
01:29:20,137 --> 01:29:22,867
My dear, don't, please!

787
01:29:28,778 --> 01:29:30,871
Now, look what you've made me do.

788
01:29:38,488 --> 01:29:41,821
We've been together six months,
on the road and here...

789
01:29:42,993 --> 01:29:46,656
...and we've not done anything
you'll have to lie about to Tonya.

790
01:29:47,864 --> 01:29:50,355
I don't want you to have to lie about me.

791
01:29:51,601 --> 01:29:53,296
You understand that, Yuri?

792
01:29:56,773 --> 01:29:58,468
You understand everything.

793
01:30:08,685 --> 01:30:10,846
Come on, Comrades! I'm in a hurry.

794
01:30:11,454 --> 01:30:12,944
Going home, Kuril?

795
01:30:13,223 --> 01:30:14,781
Home, Your Excellency?

796
01:30:15,025 --> 01:30:17,391
Petrograd. I'm joining the Red Guard.

797
01:30:17,561 --> 01:30:19,051
What about your wife?

798
01:30:19,829 --> 01:30:22,389
Sometimes, Comrade Nurse,
women have to wait.

799
01:30:23,300 --> 01:30:24,289
Right!

800
01:30:24,568 --> 01:30:26,263
Goodbye, honored Doctor.

801
01:30:27,404 --> 01:30:28,803
Want some advice?

802
01:30:28,905 --> 01:30:31,738
- Said the millstone to the barley.
- That's right.

803
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:33,070
Adapt yourself!

804
01:30:41,218 --> 01:30:42,549
Goodbye, Durinev.

805
01:30:42,786 --> 01:30:44,276
Goodbye, Your Honor.

806
01:30:45,755 --> 01:30:47,188
Goodbye, Andr.

807
01:30:48,258 --> 01:30:49,589
Goodbye, Simyon.

808
01:30:53,230 --> 01:30:55,130
I'll never forget Your Honor.

809
01:30:56,032 --> 01:30:57,056
Never!

810
01:30:58,568 --> 01:30:59,899
Goodbye, Zhivago.

811
01:31:01,871 --> 01:31:03,361
Goodbye. Thank you.

812
01:31:07,010 --> 01:31:07,999
Pilenko.

813
01:31:46,616 --> 01:31:48,811
Goodbye, brothers!

814
01:32:34,464 --> 01:32:36,159
The doctor is a gentleman.

815
01:32:36,499 --> 01:32:38,057
Right. Written all over him.

816
01:32:38,134 --> 01:32:39,829
He's a good man.

817
01:32:40,203 --> 01:32:41,727
God rot good men.

818
01:32:58,822 --> 01:32:59,846
Yuri!

819
01:33:31,788 --> 01:33:35,280
This is Comrade Yelkin,
our local delegate. He lives here.

820
01:33:37,193 --> 01:33:38,421
How do you do?

821
01:33:39,329 --> 01:33:40,353
Welcome.

822
01:33:41,331 --> 01:33:42,821
Comrade Kaprugina...

823
01:33:43,032 --> 01:33:43,862
Welcome.

824
01:33:43,933 --> 01:33:46,197
It's not for you to welcome us, Comrade.

825
01:33:46,269 --> 01:33:50,035
Comrade Kaprugina is the chairman
of the Residents' Committee.

826
01:33:50,807 --> 01:33:53,173
- Yes, of course.
- Your discharge papers?

827
01:33:53,610 --> 01:33:54,634
Oh, yes.

828
01:33:56,346 --> 01:33:58,405
I signed them myself, I'm afraid.

829
01:34:04,387 --> 01:34:05,547
Holy Cross?

830
01:34:06,322 --> 01:34:07,380
What?

831
01:34:07,657 --> 01:34:11,149
- Holy Cross Hospital. It's on...
- The Second Reformed Hospital.

832
01:34:13,730 --> 01:34:15,561
Good. It needed reforming.

833
01:34:21,504 --> 01:34:24,337
Medicals report
to their place of work at once.

834
01:34:24,541 --> 01:34:26,532
Yes. I believe there's typhus?

835
01:34:28,344 --> 01:34:30,938
You've been listening
to rumormongers, Comrade.

836
01:34:31,014 --> 01:34:33,005
There is no typhus in our city.

837
01:34:33,950 --> 01:34:36,817
Well, that's good news.
I'll report tomorrow.

838
01:34:37,387 --> 01:34:40,220
When you've started work,
you'll get a ration book.

839
01:34:41,024 --> 01:34:42,491
I've always worked.

840
01:34:48,298 --> 01:34:49,959
Whatever is the matter?

841
01:34:50,333 --> 01:34:51,322
You are.

842
01:34:54,437 --> 01:34:58,601
There was living space for 13 families
in this one house.

843
01:35:01,845 --> 01:35:05,303
Yes. This is a better arrangement,
Comrades.

844
01:35:05,715 --> 01:35:06,773
More just.

845
01:35:14,791 --> 01:35:18,283
Well, it is more just, Tonya.
Why did it sound so funny?

846
01:35:28,538 --> 01:35:30,130
Is it good to be home?

847
01:35:40,116 --> 01:35:41,105
Sasha?

848
01:35:41,217 --> 01:35:42,377
Who else?

849
01:35:45,021 --> 01:35:46,579
It's your daddy, Sasha.

850
01:35:46,656 --> 01:35:47,645
Sasha!

851
01:35:49,325 --> 01:35:50,314
Sasha!

852
01:35:51,928 --> 01:35:52,917
Naughty boy!

853
01:35:52,996 --> 01:35:54,486
No, don't say that.

854
01:35:56,566 --> 01:35:57,897
May I come in?

855
01:36:00,603 --> 01:36:02,036
Watch carefully.

856
01:36:03,006 --> 01:36:06,840
I am about to ignite the last half
of the last cigar in Moscow.

857
01:36:09,579 --> 01:36:10,739
Good meal?

858
01:36:11,014 --> 01:36:12,777
- Very.
- Say something.

859
01:36:15,151 --> 01:36:16,914
That was very good, Tonya.

860
01:36:17,020 --> 01:36:18,078
That was nothing.

861
01:36:18,154 --> 01:36:20,486
She's been saving that salami
for three months.

862
01:36:20,557 --> 01:36:21,649
Have you, darling?

863
01:36:21,724 --> 01:36:23,055
I got it for a clock.

864
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:26,622
She's a marvel. Coffee, you observe.

865
01:36:27,030 --> 01:36:29,760
Stop it, Daddy. He knows I'm a marvel.

866
01:36:31,367 --> 01:36:32,857
Did you write any poetry?

867
01:36:32,936 --> 01:36:34,198
Quite a lot.

868
01:36:34,671 --> 01:36:35,763
Is it good?

869
01:36:36,873 --> 01:36:38,704
Yes, I think so.

870
01:36:39,642 --> 01:36:40,836
Can I see it?

871
01:36:41,611 --> 01:36:43,101
Well, of course.

872
01:36:44,881 --> 01:36:48,715
What happened to Nurse Antipova?
Your letters were full of her.

873
01:36:49,686 --> 01:36:51,381
Yes, I suppose they were.

874
01:36:52,422 --> 01:36:55,414
That's the girl who shot
friend Komarovsky, isn't it?

875
01:36:55,625 --> 01:36:57,456
Yes, Daddy. You know it is.

876
01:36:57,827 --> 01:36:59,988
She's gone home to her little girl.

877
01:37:01,064 --> 01:37:03,055
- Oh, we shan't see her then?
- No.

878
01:37:04,067 --> 01:37:05,227
What a pity!

879
01:37:13,977 --> 01:37:16,241
Farewell, the pleasures of the flesh.

880
01:37:17,747 --> 01:37:21,581
What I don't understand is
how we're going to stay alive this winter.

881
01:37:26,656 --> 01:37:29,022
You have no right whatever
to call me from work.

882
01:37:29,092 --> 01:37:30,525
As a Soviet deputy, l...

883
01:37:30,593 --> 01:37:32,993
That gives you the power, not the right.

884
01:37:33,262 --> 01:37:36,425
It's noticed, you know.
Your attitude is noticed.

885
01:37:36,633 --> 01:37:39,295
You should have called the area doctor.

886
01:37:39,569 --> 01:37:41,503
I want this done quietly.

887
01:37:41,938 --> 01:37:43,929
Why, what is it, typhus?

888
01:37:54,150 --> 01:37:56,812
I'll take him away. Get me some transport.

889
01:37:57,353 --> 01:37:58,911
It isn't typhus.

890
01:37:59,689 --> 01:38:02,852
It's another disease
we don't have in Moscow: Starvation.

891
01:38:03,292 --> 01:38:05,157
That seems to give you satisfaction.

892
01:38:05,228 --> 01:38:07,526
It would give me satisfaction
to hear you admit it.

893
01:38:07,597 --> 01:38:09,963
- Would it? Why?
- Because it is so.

894
01:38:11,501 --> 01:38:15,028
Your attitude is noticed, you know.
Oh, yes, it's been noticed.

895
01:38:19,575 --> 01:38:20,564
Hello.

896
01:38:25,314 --> 01:38:26,645
The stove's out!

897
01:38:31,387 --> 01:38:32,718
The stove's out!

898
01:38:33,790 --> 01:38:36,782
What's the matter with you?
No wonder he's losing weight!

899
01:38:45,268 --> 01:38:49,762
She lets it out as soon as you've gone,
and she lights it before you come home.

900
01:39:03,286 --> 01:39:04,947
We haven't enough fuel.

901
01:39:24,140 --> 01:39:29,442
I told myself it was beneath my dignity
to arrest a man for pilfering firewood.

902
01:39:32,248 --> 01:39:35,547
But nothing ordered by the Party
is beneath the dignity of any man...

903
01:39:35,618 --> 01:39:37,085
...and the Party was right.

904
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:40,312
One man desperate for a bit of fuel
is pathetic.

905
01:39:40,656 --> 01:39:44,183
Five million people desperate for fuel
will destroy a city.

906
01:39:45,361 --> 01:39:48,057
That was the first time
I ever saw my brother.

907
01:39:48,131 --> 01:39:52,363
But, I knew him,
and I knew that I would disobey the Party.

908
01:39:53,269 --> 01:39:56,602
Perhaps it was the tie of blood
between us, but I doubt it.

909
01:39:56,906 --> 01:40:00,603
We were only half-tied, anyway,
and brothers will betray a brother.

910
01:40:00,843 --> 01:40:04,040
Indeed, as a policeman, I would say
"Get hold of a man's brother...

911
01:40:04,113 --> 01:40:05,774
"...and you're half way home."

912
01:40:06,349 --> 01:40:09,250
Nor was it admiration
for a better man than me.

913
01:40:10,186 --> 01:40:13,849
I did admire him, but I didn't think
he was a better man.

914
01:40:14,423 --> 01:40:17,915
Besides, I've executed better men than me
with a small pistol.

915
01:40:50,326 --> 01:40:53,124
Now you'll have to live
like the rest of us, Doctor.

916
01:40:53,196 --> 01:40:55,357
Bring that! Bring that back!

917
01:40:55,431 --> 01:40:57,956
Oh, listen to His Excellency!

918
01:40:59,936 --> 01:41:01,460
I want no anarchy!

919
01:41:02,305 --> 01:41:04,398
I want this carried out correctly.

920
01:41:07,610 --> 01:41:08,770
What are you doing?

921
01:41:08,845 --> 01:41:10,938
Re-allocation of living space,
Comrade Doctor.

922
01:41:11,013 --> 01:41:13,880
Fifty square meters
for a family of less than five persons.

923
01:41:13,950 --> 01:41:16,043
Dammit, whose house is this, anyway?

924
01:41:16,319 --> 01:41:17,809
Father, be quiet!

925
01:41:17,887 --> 01:41:21,345
All right, 50 square meters.
What're you doing with my things?

926
01:41:21,424 --> 01:41:22,652
They're being stored.

927
01:41:22,725 --> 01:41:24,215
They're being stolen.

928
01:41:25,294 --> 01:41:26,591
Just a minute!

929
01:41:36,539 --> 01:41:38,302
And where did you get this?

930
01:41:38,474 --> 01:41:40,442
I pulled it out of a fence.

931
01:42:08,371 --> 01:42:10,339
I told them who I was.

932
01:42:10,706 --> 01:42:14,665
The old man was hostile, the girl cautious.

933
01:42:15,611 --> 01:42:16,805
My brother...

934
01:42:18,814 --> 01:42:20,406
...seemed very pleased.

935
01:42:24,353 --> 01:42:27,845
I think the girl was the only one
who guessed at their position.

936
01:42:29,592 --> 01:42:33,028
You're just as I imagined you.
You're my political conscience.

937
01:42:33,129 --> 01:42:35,359
I asked him hadn't he one of his own.

938
01:42:35,631 --> 01:42:37,929
And so he talked about the Revolution.

939
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:42,437
You lay life on a table and you cut out
all the tumors of injustice. Marvelous.

940
01:42:42,505 --> 01:42:45,736
I told him if he felt like that
he should join the Party.

941
01:42:46,175 --> 01:42:49,633
Cutting out the tumors of injustice,
that's a deep operation.

942
01:42:49,912 --> 01:42:52,142
Someone must keep life alive
while you do it.

943
01:42:52,214 --> 01:42:53,442
By living.

944
01:42:53,916 --> 01:42:55,247
Isn't that right?

945
01:42:55,318 --> 01:42:57,445
I thought then it was wrong.

946
01:42:58,120 --> 01:43:01,715
He told me what he thought
about the Party and I trembled for him.

947
01:43:01,824 --> 01:43:06,386
He approved of us, but for reasons
which were subtle, like his verse.

948
01:43:07,063 --> 01:43:09,691
Approval such as his
could vanish overnight.

949
01:43:09,765 --> 01:43:10,823
I told him so.

950
01:43:10,900 --> 01:43:14,358
Of course, I can't approve this evening
something you may do tomorrow.

951
01:43:14,437 --> 01:43:18,669
He was walking about with a noose
round his neck and didn't know.

952
01:43:19,208 --> 01:43:23,042
So I told him what I had heard
about his poems.

953
01:43:24,981 --> 01:43:26,278
Not liked?

954
01:43:27,416 --> 01:43:28,883
Not liked by whom?

955
01:43:30,386 --> 01:43:31,614
Why not liked?

956
01:43:31,687 --> 01:43:33,279
So I told him that.

957
01:43:42,732 --> 01:43:46,668
Do you think it's "personal,
petit-bourgeois and self indulgent"?

958
01:43:48,104 --> 01:43:49,162
I lied.

959
01:43:49,872 --> 01:43:51,499
But he believed me.

960
01:43:52,208 --> 01:43:55,644
And it struck me through to see
that my opinion mattered.

961
01:43:57,413 --> 01:44:00,143
The girl knew what it meant,
what it was going to mean.

962
01:44:00,216 --> 01:44:03,276
They couldn't survive
what was coming in the city.

963
01:44:03,352 --> 01:44:06,583
I urged them to leave and live obscurely
somewhere in the country...

964
01:44:06,655 --> 01:44:08,816
...where they could keep themselves alive.

965
01:44:08,891 --> 01:44:12,520
We have, used to have,
an estate at Varykino, near Yuriatin.

966
01:44:14,964 --> 01:44:16,932
The people know us there.

967
01:44:17,233 --> 01:44:18,564
He didn't resist.

968
01:44:18,868 --> 01:44:21,928
I offered to obtain permits,
passes, warrants...

969
01:44:22,271 --> 01:44:25,240
...told them what to take
and what to leave behind.

970
01:44:28,844 --> 01:44:32,245
I had the impertinence to ask him
for a volume of his poems.

971
01:44:33,582 --> 01:44:35,174
And so we parted.

972
01:44:35,518 --> 01:44:39,079
I think I even told him
that we would meet again in better times.

973
01:44:39,722 --> 01:44:41,417
But perhaps I didn't.

974
01:46:40,009 --> 01:46:41,340
Fifty persons!

975
01:46:41,477 --> 01:46:42,967
Fifty persons only!

976
01:46:43,145 --> 01:46:44,476
Fifty persons!

977
01:46:48,217 --> 01:46:49,479
Tonya, here!

978
01:46:49,585 --> 01:46:51,746
Fifty persons only!

979
01:46:52,087 --> 01:46:53,247
Get back!

980
01:46:55,724 --> 01:46:57,589
Fifty persons only!

981
01:46:57,993 --> 01:46:59,688
Fifty persons!

982
01:47:00,996 --> 01:47:02,463
Fifty persons!

983
01:47:02,598 --> 01:47:04,998
Only 50 persons!

984
01:47:17,813 --> 01:47:19,542
Charming accommodation.

985
01:47:19,782 --> 01:47:21,647
Charming accommodation.

986
01:47:22,351 --> 01:47:23,716
That's very good.

987
01:47:24,220 --> 01:47:25,687
I'm an intellectual.

988
01:47:25,754 --> 01:47:28,382
Shut up, you "intellectual."

989
01:47:30,125 --> 01:47:31,854
Shut up, you lickspittle.

990
01:47:39,335 --> 01:47:40,324
Forced labor.

991
01:47:51,313 --> 01:47:52,803
Attention, Comrades.

992
01:47:52,948 --> 01:47:55,314
Your train will leave tomorrow morning.

993
01:47:55,551 --> 01:47:57,678
Health regulations for the journey:

994
01:47:58,120 --> 01:48:00,850
Night soil will be emptied
every morning without fail.

995
01:48:00,923 --> 01:48:04,791
Straw to be replaced at ten day intervals
and the old straw burned.

996
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:08,657
In the event of fresh straw
being unavailable, old straw to be turned.

997
01:48:09,632 --> 01:48:11,566
This is disinfectant. Use it.

998
01:48:13,602 --> 01:48:16,036
In this wagon is a detachment
of Voluntary Labor.

999
01:48:16,105 --> 01:48:17,129
Liar.

1000
01:48:22,244 --> 01:48:25,645
You are required by Military Committee
to show them all assistance.

1001
01:48:25,748 --> 01:48:29,775
One carriage is occupied by sailors
of the heroic Kronstadt Sailors' Soviet.

1002
01:48:31,620 --> 01:48:33,087
So you'll be in good hands.

1003
01:48:33,155 --> 01:48:34,452
They're idiots.

1004
01:48:36,392 --> 01:48:37,859
Attention, Comrades.

1005
01:48:38,294 --> 01:48:41,855
In approximately 11 days' time
you'll pass through the Urals province...

1006
01:48:41,930 --> 01:48:45,024
...where White Guard units,
aided by foreign interventionists...

1007
01:48:45,100 --> 01:48:48,592
...and other criminal reactionary elements,
have recently been active.

1008
01:48:49,338 --> 01:48:51,397
The Military Committee assures you...

1009
01:48:51,573 --> 01:48:54,701
...that the criminals have been
completely routed in that area...

1010
01:48:54,777 --> 01:48:58,679
...by Red Guard units under the command
of People's Commander Strelnikov.

1011
01:49:00,649 --> 01:49:01,877
There's a man.

1012
01:49:02,384 --> 01:49:03,408
Clap him.

1013
01:49:05,387 --> 01:49:07,685
The line is definitely clear.

1014
01:49:08,390 --> 01:49:09,823
Long live the Revolution!

1015
01:49:09,892 --> 01:49:11,257
Long live anarchy!

1016
01:49:11,560 --> 01:49:13,790
Lickspittle! Bureaucrat!

1017
01:49:23,405 --> 01:49:24,838
Is that necessary?

1018
01:49:25,941 --> 01:49:29,604
Six volunteers I've signed for,
and six I'll deliver.

1019
01:49:31,113 --> 01:49:33,513
I'm a free man, lickspittle.

1020
01:49:34,550 --> 01:49:36,814
There's nothing you can do about it.

1021
01:49:42,758 --> 01:49:45,283
I'm the only free man on this train.

1022
01:49:46,562 --> 01:49:48,462
The rest of you are cattle.

1023
01:55:01,176 --> 01:55:03,576
Help me, brothers, for the love of God.

1024
01:55:19,494 --> 01:55:21,121
Come on!

1025
01:55:40,816 --> 01:55:42,750
Yuri, the child is dead.

1026
01:55:52,561 --> 01:55:54,426
It wasn't my child, dear...

1027
01:55:54,696 --> 01:55:57,756
...and his little soul's in Heaven now,
that's certain.

1028
01:55:59,301 --> 01:56:01,496
Who did it, Comrade, the Whites?

1029
01:56:01,970 --> 01:56:03,130
The Whites?

1030
01:56:05,340 --> 01:56:07,240
No, Strelnikov.

1031
01:56:09,010 --> 01:56:11,535
Well, then, you must have done something.

1032
01:56:12,180 --> 01:56:13,977
It wasn't us, Comrade.

1033
01:56:14,249 --> 01:56:16,717
The commander said
we'd sold horses to the Whites.

1034
01:56:16,785 --> 01:56:19,083
It wasn't us, it was those pigs in Kuniko.

1035
01:56:19,221 --> 01:56:21,189
We told him, but he didn't believe us.

1036
01:56:21,256 --> 01:56:22,951
I expect you were lying.

1037
01:56:23,024 --> 01:56:25,185
- As God's my witness.
- But he isn't.

1038
01:56:27,229 --> 01:56:29,390
Commander Strelnikov is a great man.

1039
01:56:31,066 --> 01:56:34,593
A commander, Sasha,
and he lives on bread and water.

1040
01:56:35,203 --> 01:56:36,261
Does he?

1041
01:56:37,172 --> 01:56:38,639
I don't know. They say so.

1042
01:56:38,707 --> 01:56:39,696
It's true.

1043
01:56:39,775 --> 01:56:41,834
No one knows where he comes from.

1044
01:56:42,344 --> 01:56:44,335
And they never know where he is.

1045
01:56:44,479 --> 01:56:46,709
- He's back up the line.
- Yes?

1046
01:56:49,751 --> 01:56:51,184
Someone's for it.

1047
01:56:53,755 --> 01:56:55,450
Oh, really, not again!

1048
01:56:57,058 --> 01:56:58,389
What this time?

1049
01:57:08,637 --> 01:57:11,299
Never mind, Father.
Get a good night's sleep.

1050
01:57:16,511 --> 01:57:18,308
I know what I'm going to do.

1051
01:57:41,069 --> 01:57:42,093
Look!

1052
01:57:43,271 --> 01:57:44,499
The Urals.

1053
01:57:46,374 --> 01:57:49,366
Look, Sasha, look.
That's where we're going, darling.

1054
01:57:49,711 --> 01:57:52,202
Through the mountains and into the forest.

1055
01:57:52,447 --> 01:57:54,438
Then it'll be much warmer still.

1056
01:57:55,684 --> 01:57:58,175
Will there be wolves in the forest?

1057
01:58:22,978 --> 01:58:24,570
Strelnikov!

1058
01:58:32,654 --> 01:58:34,144
That's Strelnikov.

1059
02:03:30,206 --> 02:03:31,230
Daddy!

1060
02:03:34,344 --> 02:03:35,902
What's that noise?

1061
02:03:37,147 --> 02:03:38,808
It's only a waterfall.

1062
02:03:39,049 --> 02:03:40,539
No, the other noise.

1063
02:03:44,854 --> 02:03:46,185
Guns, Sasha.

1064
02:03:47,023 --> 02:03:48,513
Are they fighting?

1065
02:03:48,725 --> 02:03:51,285
They must be. It's a long way away.

1066
02:03:51,995 --> 02:03:53,360
Let's go to sleep.

1067
02:04:43,780 --> 02:04:44,872
Get him!

1068
02:04:51,254 --> 02:04:52,414
Look!

1069
02:05:00,830 --> 02:05:01,956
Is that all?

1070
02:05:02,031 --> 02:05:03,362
That's all.

1071
02:05:11,508 --> 02:05:12,839
Bring him.

1072
02:05:25,455 --> 02:05:27,286
Who sent you here, Zhivago?

1073
02:05:27,724 --> 02:05:29,851
No one sent me here, Commander.

1074
02:05:29,993 --> 02:05:32,223
I'm going to Yuriatin
with my wife and child.

1075
02:05:32,295 --> 02:05:34,058
They're on the train from Moscow.

1076
02:05:34,130 --> 02:05:35,791
Yes, we've checked that.

1077
02:05:36,299 --> 02:05:37,029
Then?

1078
02:05:37,033 --> 02:05:40,867
You put your knife with a fork and a spoon
and it looks quite innocuous.

1079
02:05:40,937 --> 02:05:44,429
Perhaps you travel with a wife and child
for the same reason?

1080
02:05:46,543 --> 02:05:47,532
No.

1081
02:05:47,844 --> 02:05:51,837
Yuriatin is occupied by White Guards.
Is that why you're going there?

1082
02:05:52,315 --> 02:05:54,875
No. We're going on to Varykino.

1083
02:05:55,251 --> 02:05:57,879
Not through Yuriatin. It's under shellfire.

1084
02:05:58,421 --> 02:06:00,582
Commander, I'm not a White agent.

1085
02:06:02,091 --> 02:06:03,888
No, I don't think you are.

1086
02:06:04,127 --> 02:06:07,096
All right, Kolya. Thank you, Comrades.
Sit down, Doctor.

1087
02:06:07,163 --> 02:06:08,152
Take it.

1088
02:06:09,766 --> 02:06:13,429
It's not as silly as it seems.
There have been one or two attempts.

1089
02:06:19,275 --> 02:06:20,606
Are you the poet?

1090
02:06:21,411 --> 02:06:22,400
Yes.

1091
02:06:22,779 --> 02:06:24,713
I used to admire your poetry.

1092
02:06:24,781 --> 02:06:25,839
Thank you.

1093
02:06:26,416 --> 02:06:28,145
I shouldn't admire it now.

1094
02:06:28,218 --> 02:06:31,210
I should find it absurdly personal.
Don't you agree?

1095
02:06:32,222 --> 02:06:35,714
Feelings, insights, affections.
It's suddenly trivial, now.

1096
02:06:37,327 --> 02:06:39,318
You don't agree. You're wrong.

1097
02:06:39,529 --> 02:06:41,759
The personal life is dead in Russia.

1098
02:06:42,832 --> 02:06:44,424
History has killed it.

1099
02:06:45,768 --> 02:06:47,759
I can see how you might hate me.

1100
02:06:49,506 --> 02:06:52,998
I hate everything you say,
but not enough to kill you for it.

1101
02:06:55,612 --> 02:06:57,045
You have a brother?

1102
02:06:57,113 --> 02:06:57,977
Yevgraf?

1103
02:06:58,047 --> 02:07:00,072
Yevgraf. Yes. The policeman.

1104
02:07:00,350 --> 02:07:01,817
I didn't know that.

1105
02:07:01,951 --> 02:07:05,182
Perhaps not. A "secret" policeman.
Did he send you here?

1106
02:07:05,255 --> 02:07:06,347
Yevgraf?

1107
02:07:06,556 --> 02:07:08,285
No, Yevgraf's a Bolshevik.

1108
02:07:12,795 --> 02:07:15,662
I don't know anything about these things.

1109
02:07:15,732 --> 02:07:17,563
Oh, you know a great deal.

1110
02:07:18,735 --> 02:07:20,896
When you came in you recognized me.

1111
02:07:21,371 --> 02:07:22,463
How?

1112
02:07:22,805 --> 02:07:24,739
Has someone shown you photographs?

1113
02:07:24,807 --> 02:07:25,831
No.

1114
02:07:26,142 --> 02:07:28,406
I am certain that you recognized me.

1115
02:07:30,947 --> 02:07:33,108
I've seen you before, Commander.

1116
02:07:33,917 --> 02:07:34,941
When?

1117
02:07:35,318 --> 02:07:36,649
Six years ago.

1118
02:07:37,320 --> 02:07:38,480
Go on.

1119
02:07:38,922 --> 02:07:40,412
Christmas Eve. You...

1120
02:07:41,658 --> 02:07:42,920
You were there?

1121
02:07:43,560 --> 02:07:45,494
Or, has someone told you this?

1122
02:07:46,162 --> 02:07:49,154
I attended to the man
who was injured by your wife.

1123
02:07:50,033 --> 02:07:51,967
Why do you call her my wife?

1124
02:07:53,303 --> 02:07:54,668
I met her again.

1125
02:07:55,038 --> 02:07:57,666
We served together on the Ukranian Front.

1126
02:07:57,874 --> 02:08:00,604
If she's with you,
I'm sure she'd vouch for me.

1127
02:08:00,977 --> 02:08:03,104
I haven't seen her since the war.

1128
02:08:04,147 --> 02:08:05,512
She's in Yuriatin.

1129
02:08:08,885 --> 02:08:10,147
Yuriatin!

1130
02:08:11,688 --> 02:08:16,523
The private life is dead,
for a man with any manhood.

1131
02:08:17,727 --> 02:08:20,821
We saw a sample of your manhood
on the way, a place called Mink.

1132
02:08:20,897 --> 02:08:22,762
They were selling horses to the Whites.

1133
02:08:22,832 --> 02:08:23,730
No.

1134
02:08:24,067 --> 02:08:25,932
It seems you burned the wrong village.

1135
02:08:26,002 --> 02:08:28,027
They always say that.
And what does it matter?

1136
02:08:28,104 --> 02:08:30,937
A village betrays us, a village is burnt.
The point's made.

1137
02:08:31,274 --> 02:08:33,242
Your point, their village.

1138
02:08:33,710 --> 02:08:34,904
Kolya!

1139
02:08:41,517 --> 02:08:44,884
And what will you do
with your wife and child in Varykino?

1140
02:08:44,954 --> 02:08:46,114
Just live.

1141
02:08:47,857 --> 02:08:49,825
Take him away. He's innocent.

1142
02:09:01,170 --> 02:09:02,398
You're lucky.

1143
02:09:36,873 --> 02:09:39,535
We've been diverted.
Do you know where we're going?

1144
02:09:39,609 --> 02:09:40,906
Varykino Halt.

1145
02:09:55,458 --> 02:09:56,482
Hello?

1146
02:10:00,496 --> 02:10:01,554
Hello?

1147
02:10:05,802 --> 02:10:07,133
How lovely!

1148
02:10:12,008 --> 02:10:13,498
Oh, how lovely!

1149
02:10:15,978 --> 02:10:17,070
Hello?

1150
02:10:18,081 --> 02:10:19,139
Hello?

1151
02:10:25,354 --> 02:10:27,151
Alexander Maximiovich?

1152
02:10:27,323 --> 02:10:28,312
Yes.

1153
02:10:29,225 --> 02:10:30,658
It's me, Petya.

1154
02:10:32,428 --> 02:10:33,292
Your Honor!

1155
02:10:33,362 --> 02:10:36,024
Now, now, now,
that's all done with, you know.

1156
02:10:38,434 --> 02:10:40,595
How do we get to the house, Petya?

1157
02:10:41,037 --> 02:10:42,629
As you always did, Your Honor.

1158
02:11:04,894 --> 02:11:06,225
Look, Sasha!

1159
02:11:11,033 --> 02:11:13,695
What is it, Petya? Forest fire?

1160
02:11:14,237 --> 02:11:16,364
Forest fire, Your Honor?

1161
02:11:16,439 --> 02:11:17,906
That's Yuriatin.

1162
02:11:18,708 --> 02:11:21,700
Poor souls.
First the Reds, then the Whites.

1163
02:11:22,111 --> 02:11:23,601
Now, the Reds again.

1164
02:11:24,247 --> 02:11:27,080
That's Strelnikov. His heart must be dead.

1165
02:11:31,220 --> 02:11:32,949
We'll soon be there, now, Sasha.

1166
02:11:33,022 --> 02:11:34,512
Another five miles.

1167
02:11:34,657 --> 02:11:38,457
Is it that far? One forgets.
How is the place?

1168
02:11:38,961 --> 02:11:42,954
Oh, well enough, Your Honor.
It's all locked up, you know.

1169
02:12:00,750 --> 02:12:01,910
Varykino!

1170
02:12:53,636 --> 02:12:55,570
All locked up, you see.

1171
02:13:02,178 --> 02:13:03,805
A body, styling itself.

1172
02:13:04,780 --> 02:13:07,749
The Yuriatin Committee
of Revolutionary Justice...

1173
02:13:08,451 --> 02:13:11,943
...has expropriated my house
in the name of the people.

1174
02:13:12,989 --> 02:13:14,320
Very well.

1175
02:13:14,457 --> 02:13:16,948
I'm one of the people, too!

1176
02:13:19,195 --> 02:13:21,857
Don't, Your Honor!
They'd call it counterrevolution.

1177
02:13:21,931 --> 02:13:23,956
- Get out of my way!
- Father, don't!

1178
02:13:24,033 --> 02:13:25,432
Petya brought us here.

1179
02:13:25,501 --> 02:13:27,992
That makes him
a counterrevolutionary, too.

1180
02:13:28,271 --> 02:13:30,398
They shoot counterrevolutionaries.

1181
02:13:43,519 --> 02:13:46,716
It's not the Reds in the town,
it's the Reds in the forest.

1182
02:13:46,956 --> 02:13:48,787
- Partisans.
- Here?

1183
02:13:48,891 --> 02:13:52,122
Who knows? They go where they want,
and they do what they want.

1184
02:13:52,194 --> 02:13:54,059
All we need is a roof, Petya.

1185
02:13:54,230 --> 02:13:57,028
And a bit of garden. Is there nowhere?

1186
02:14:02,038 --> 02:14:03,903
They didn't lock the cottage.

1187
02:14:14,483 --> 02:14:16,280
Oh, yes, we can manage here.

1188
02:14:20,556 --> 02:14:22,046
Oh, the stove works.

1189
02:14:23,426 --> 02:14:25,485
I'll find you a few sticks of furniture.

1190
02:14:25,561 --> 02:14:27,153
And some seed potatoes?

1191
02:14:28,130 --> 02:14:30,963
I'm afraid the garden is
dreadfully run back.

1192
02:14:41,811 --> 02:14:43,142
Yes. Thank you.

1193
02:15:12,842 --> 02:15:14,207
Well done, my boy.

1194
02:15:14,510 --> 02:15:17,502
I must say, scratch a Russian
and you'll find a peasant.

1195
02:15:17,580 --> 02:15:19,070
I've always said so.

1196
02:15:19,215 --> 02:15:20,648
Well, you're wrong.

1197
02:15:20,716 --> 02:15:23,549
He works like a peasant,
but he isn't a peasant.

1198
02:15:23,619 --> 02:15:25,780
I don't mind, Tonya. Really.

1199
02:15:26,122 --> 02:15:28,283
- It's a good life.
- It certainly is.

1200
02:15:28,357 --> 02:15:32,851
I wouldn't be surprised if you two didn't
look back on this time as one of your best.

1201
02:15:34,130 --> 02:15:36,963
Awfully glad about the expected
new arrival, Yuri.

1202
02:15:37,733 --> 02:15:39,633
Anna was born here, you know.

1203
02:15:40,202 --> 02:15:41,965
Oh, no, I didn't know that.

1204
02:15:42,138 --> 02:15:43,799
Well, I'm terribly glad.

1205
02:15:44,640 --> 02:15:46,301
Here's winged Mercury.

1206
02:15:48,811 --> 02:15:50,836
Looks a bit down in the mouth.

1207
02:15:52,948 --> 02:15:54,142
Enter.

1208
02:15:54,617 --> 02:15:56,346
What news from Yuriatin?

1209
02:15:56,485 --> 02:16:00,216
There's no lard, no sugar.
Oil, next week, perhaps.

1210
02:16:00,489 --> 02:16:04,118
There's flour, salt, coffee and nails.

1211
02:16:09,265 --> 02:16:10,357
Bad news?

1212
02:16:11,333 --> 02:16:14,029
Oh, Lord, not another purge!

1213
02:16:14,170 --> 02:16:15,296
No.

1214
02:16:15,371 --> 02:16:16,736
Strelnikov's gone.

1215
02:16:17,540 --> 02:16:18,734
That's not bad news.

1216
02:16:18,808 --> 02:16:22,039
No. He's in Manchuria, they say.

1217
02:16:26,882 --> 02:16:28,372
That's the news.

1218
02:16:49,438 --> 02:16:51,065
They've shot the tsar.

1219
02:16:53,709 --> 02:16:55,199
And all his family.

1220
02:16:58,747 --> 02:17:01,079
Oh, that's a savage deed.

1221
02:17:04,453 --> 02:17:05,886
What's it for?

1222
02:17:08,891 --> 02:17:11,121
It's to show there's no going back.

1223
02:18:23,899 --> 02:18:26,060
Yuri, why don't you go to Yuriatin?

1224
02:18:27,002 --> 02:18:30,165
Yes, why don't you, my boy?
It'd do you good.

1225
02:18:31,707 --> 02:18:33,732
Why? What's in Yuriatin?

1226
02:18:34,310 --> 02:18:36,073
It isn't Petersburg.

1227
02:18:36,145 --> 02:18:38,238
A very decent little library...

1228
02:18:38,347 --> 02:18:39,939
...if it's still there.

1229
02:18:40,416 --> 02:18:41,747
I wish you would.

1230
02:18:43,752 --> 02:18:45,276
No, I don't think so.

1231
02:18:46,155 --> 02:18:48,055
Anyway, the roads are blocked.

1232
02:20:52,748 --> 02:20:53,737
Zhivago?

1233
02:20:57,953 --> 02:20:58,942
Yes.

1234
02:21:04,760 --> 02:21:05,920
How are you?

1235
02:21:07,629 --> 02:21:09,290
What are you doing here?

1236
02:21:09,732 --> 02:21:11,097
We're at Varykino.

1237
02:21:13,302 --> 02:21:14,360
Varykino?

1238
02:21:21,276 --> 02:21:22,470
Why Varykino?

1239
02:21:23,278 --> 02:21:25,439
Why not? We had to go somewhere.

1240
02:21:25,647 --> 02:21:27,137
But, here!

1241
02:21:28,217 --> 02:21:31,653
I came here to find my husband.
The one who was reported killed.

1242
02:21:31,720 --> 02:21:33,984
Strelnikov. I met him.

1243
02:21:35,657 --> 02:21:36,783
Met him?

1244
02:21:36,959 --> 02:21:37,983
Yes.

1245
02:23:11,019 --> 02:23:13,180
How long have you been living here?

1246
02:23:14,456 --> 02:23:15,718
About a year.

1247
02:23:20,596 --> 02:23:21,585
Alone?

1248
02:23:21,730 --> 02:23:22,822
With Katya.

1249
02:23:23,932 --> 02:23:25,297
Where's Katya now?

1250
02:23:26,101 --> 02:23:27,159
At school.

1251
02:24:17,653 --> 02:24:19,052
Is Tonya with you?

1252
02:24:20,455 --> 02:24:21,547
All of us.

1253
02:24:22,357 --> 02:24:23,346
Sasha?

1254
02:24:23,592 --> 02:24:24,752
Of course.

1255
02:24:29,831 --> 02:24:31,492
What are we going to do?

1256
02:24:32,167 --> 02:24:33,361
I don't know.

1257
02:25:48,377 --> 02:25:49,401
Yuri?

1258
02:25:51,380 --> 02:25:53,245
It's awfully early, isn't it?

1259
02:25:53,915 --> 02:25:55,143
Half past six.

1260
02:25:55,951 --> 02:25:57,418
What are you doing?

1261
02:25:58,120 --> 02:25:59,849
Nothing. Couldn't sleep.

1262
02:26:00,656 --> 02:26:02,248
Is anything the matter?

1263
02:26:02,658 --> 02:26:03,647
No.

1264
02:26:08,764 --> 02:26:10,254
Shall I get some tea?

1265
02:26:12,668 --> 02:26:13,760
Yes, do.

1266
02:27:35,050 --> 02:27:38,019
Hello. You are silly. We called and called.

1267
02:27:38,086 --> 02:27:40,577
- Did you? I didn't hear.
- Well, we did.

1268
02:27:43,191 --> 02:27:44,920
- Hello, Lara.
- Hello.

1269
02:27:47,629 --> 02:27:49,620
How's Olya Petrovna?

1270
02:27:49,698 --> 02:27:51,529
She gets worse and worse.

1271
02:27:51,700 --> 02:27:54,396
She gave us C.I. And arithmetic
all morning.

1272
02:27:54,636 --> 02:27:55,694
C.I.?

1273
02:27:56,104 --> 02:27:57,696
Civic Instruction.

1274
02:27:58,039 --> 02:27:59,063
Look.

1275
02:28:01,877 --> 02:28:04,107
- That's very good, Katya.
- Thank you.

1276
02:28:04,546 --> 02:28:06,013
It's the tsar.

1277
02:28:08,150 --> 02:28:10,345
The tsar was an enemy of the people.

1278
02:28:11,787 --> 02:28:14,984
Well, he didn't know he was an enemy
of the people, you know.

1279
02:28:15,056 --> 02:28:17,388
Well, he should have known, shouldn't he?

1280
02:28:17,459 --> 02:28:18,926
Yes, he should.

1281
02:28:19,528 --> 02:28:23,225
Fancy not knowing C.I.
Doesn't your little boy go to school?

1282
02:28:23,598 --> 02:28:24,622
Lunch.

1283
02:28:25,367 --> 02:28:26,425
Good.

1284
02:28:27,035 --> 02:28:28,468
Come on, you.

1285
02:29:00,068 --> 02:29:01,092
Smell.

1286
02:29:06,141 --> 02:29:08,200
This one's a prize-fighter.

1287
02:29:08,810 --> 02:29:09,834
Yuri!

1288
02:29:12,180 --> 02:29:13,442
Wait a minute.

1289
02:29:14,382 --> 02:29:15,371
There.

1290
02:29:34,469 --> 02:29:36,528
I'm going in to Yuriatin, darling...

1291
02:29:36,605 --> 02:29:37,731
What? Now?

1292
02:29:37,806 --> 02:29:41,139
Yes, I want to get some morphine,
disinfectant...

1293
02:29:41,309 --> 02:29:42,936
I shan't need morphine.

1294
02:29:43,044 --> 02:29:44,272
You never know.

1295
02:29:44,346 --> 02:29:45,904
Well, I shan't need it today.

1296
02:29:45,981 --> 02:29:48,814
No. But, it's pretty close.
I hadn't realized it.

1297
02:29:51,086 --> 02:29:53,611
- You'll be back before it's dark?
- Long before.

1298
02:30:07,002 --> 02:30:09,766
Yes, yes, my darling. Do what's best.

1299
02:30:10,405 --> 02:30:12,066
I'm not coming back.

1300
02:30:12,274 --> 02:30:13,605
I understand.

1301
02:30:14,075 --> 02:30:15,565
But, never, Lara.

1302
02:30:16,978 --> 02:30:18,377
Do you understand?

1303
02:30:19,881 --> 02:30:21,246
Do you believe me?

1304
02:31:23,712 --> 02:31:26,146
Comrade Doctor, I need a medical officer.

1305
02:31:26,214 --> 02:31:28,876
Sorry. I have a wife and child in Varykino.

1306
02:31:29,184 --> 02:31:31,015
And a mistress in Yuriatin.

1307
02:31:33,621 --> 02:31:36,351
Comrade Medical Officer,
we are Red Partisans...

1308
02:31:36,524 --> 02:31:38,492
...and we shoot deserters. Up!

1309
02:31:51,740 --> 02:31:52,729
Up!

1310
02:32:28,009 --> 02:32:30,341
- Where are you taking me?
- To the Front.

1311
02:32:31,379 --> 02:32:34,007
- And where is the Front?
- Good question.

1312
02:32:34,082 --> 02:32:36,915
The Front is wherever there are
enemies of the Revolution.

1313
02:32:36,985 --> 02:32:38,976
Wherever there is one gang
of White Guards...

1314
02:32:39,054 --> 02:32:42,080
...one battalion of foreign
interventionists, that is the Front.

1315
02:32:42,157 --> 02:32:45,684
Wherever there is one resentful
bourgeois, one unreliable schoolmaster...

1316
02:32:45,760 --> 02:32:48,251
...one dubious poet hugging
his private life.

1317
02:32:48,797 --> 02:32:50,458
That, too, is the Front.

1318
02:32:52,233 --> 02:32:54,030
How long are you going to keep me?

1319
02:32:54,102 --> 02:32:55,569
For as long as we need you.

1320
02:33:45,854 --> 02:33:46,843
Now!

1321
02:33:56,131 --> 02:33:57,291
Charge!

1322
02:34:54,689 --> 02:34:58,352
Well, that was easy. Come on, Doctor,
let's see what we've done.

1323
02:35:44,305 --> 02:35:46,637
"St. Michael's Military School."

1324
02:35:52,780 --> 02:35:55,146
You old bastard!

1325
02:36:07,095 --> 02:36:08,528
It doesn't matter.

1326
02:36:12,300 --> 02:36:14,530
Did you ever love a woman, Razin?

1327
02:36:14,936 --> 02:36:17,268
I once had a wife and four children.

1328
02:36:30,551 --> 02:36:31,745
He has been a good comrade.

1329
02:36:31,819 --> 02:36:33,582
He's been a good medical officer.

1330
02:36:33,655 --> 02:36:36,488
We took him from his wife,
we took him from his child.

1331
02:36:36,791 --> 02:36:38,281
None of this matters.

1332
02:36:39,594 --> 02:36:42,062
What does matter, Comrade Commissar?

1333
02:36:42,497 --> 02:36:43,896
Tell me, I've forgotten.

1334
02:36:43,965 --> 02:36:46,195
This is contemptible. The doctor stays.

1335
02:36:46,267 --> 02:36:47,495
I command this unit!

1336
02:36:47,568 --> 02:36:50,401
We command jointly.
The "Party Bulletin" expressly states...

1337
02:36:53,374 --> 02:36:55,672
I could have you taken out and shot.

1338
02:36:56,611 --> 02:36:59,102
And could you have the Party
taken out and shot?

1339
02:36:59,647 --> 02:37:01,046
Try to understand.

1340
02:37:01,282 --> 02:37:04,945
As the military struggle nears its close,
the political struggle intensifies.

1341
02:37:05,320 --> 02:37:08,448
In the hour of victory
the military will have served its purpose.

1342
02:37:08,523 --> 02:37:10,753
All men will then be judged politically...

1343
02:37:11,392 --> 02:37:13,758
...regardless of their military record.

1344
02:37:15,196 --> 02:37:18,688
Meanwhile, there are still White units
in this area.

1345
02:37:18,766 --> 02:37:20,097
The doctor stays.

1346
02:37:20,835 --> 02:37:22,598
That concludes the meeting.

1347
02:38:14,822 --> 02:38:16,687
Comrade, where are you going?

1348
02:38:17,425 --> 02:38:19,325
Are you running away, Comrade?

1349
02:38:20,695 --> 02:38:21,855
Soldiers.

1350
02:38:22,230 --> 02:38:24,095
Red soldiers or White soldiers?

1351
02:38:24,165 --> 02:38:25,359
Soldiers.

1352
02:40:14,942 --> 02:40:16,102
Tonya!

1353
02:40:17,211 --> 02:40:18,269
Tonya!

1354
02:40:18,446 --> 02:40:19,470
Sasha!

1355
02:40:22,683 --> 02:40:23,672
Tonya!

1356
02:40:27,455 --> 02:40:28,444
Tonya!

1357
02:40:31,192 --> 02:40:32,181
Tonya!

1358
02:40:36,731 --> 02:40:37,720
Tonya!

1359
02:40:38,065 --> 02:40:39,054
Tonya!

1360
02:41:28,816 --> 02:41:30,147
This is Yuriatin?

1361
02:41:30,318 --> 02:41:31,979
Yes. Yuriatin.

1362
02:41:33,354 --> 02:41:35,254
What's happened at Varykino?

1363
02:41:35,356 --> 02:41:36,846
The Moscow folks?

1364
02:41:37,592 --> 02:41:38,422
Yes.

1365
02:41:38,492 --> 02:41:41,984
They've gone away. Gone away.
There's nobody at Varykino.

1366
02:42:35,182 --> 02:42:38,515
Lord what happiness!
They say you are alive.

1367
02:42:38,653 --> 02:42:40,553
Someone saw you near the Town.

1368
02:42:40,988 --> 02:42:44,981
I take it you have gone to Varykino,
so I'm going there myself with Katya.

1369
02:42:45,126 --> 02:42:48,755
But just in case, I've left a little food,
boiled potatoes mostly.

1370
02:42:48,829 --> 02:42:51,821
Put the lid back on the pan
or the rats will get it.

1371
02:42:51,899 --> 02:42:54,299
Oh, I'm mad with joy.

1372
02:44:10,411 --> 02:44:11,400
Tonya!

1373
02:44:13,180 --> 02:44:14,204
Tonya!

1374
02:44:15,149 --> 02:44:16,081
Yuri.

1375
02:44:16,150 --> 02:44:17,208
Tonya!

1376
02:44:17,518 --> 02:44:20,612
Yuri. Yuri, darling.

1377
02:44:36,003 --> 02:44:38,904
It's all right, Yuri. They're safe.

1378
02:44:39,907 --> 02:44:41,272
They're in Moscow.

1379
02:44:41,509 --> 02:44:42,999
- In Moscow?
- Yes.

1380
02:44:43,778 --> 02:44:45,336
- Tonya?
- All of them.

1381
02:44:45,913 --> 02:44:47,107
They're safe.

1382
02:44:48,682 --> 02:44:49,706
Safe.

1383
02:44:52,787 --> 02:44:54,254
Firing squad...

1384
02:45:32,560 --> 02:45:33,584
Better.

1385
02:45:42,870 --> 02:45:43,928
What?

1386
02:45:45,339 --> 02:45:47,637
I've got a letter for you.

1387
02:45:47,708 --> 02:45:49,403
I've had it three months.

1388
02:45:51,679 --> 02:45:53,909
And it was three months getting here.

1389
02:45:54,315 --> 02:45:55,646
It's from Moscow.

1390
02:45:58,252 --> 02:45:59,913
I think it's from Tonya.

1391
02:46:00,387 --> 02:46:02,548
It's addressed to you. Care of me.

1392
02:46:05,059 --> 02:46:08,222
She came into Yuriatin to find you
when you vanished.

1393
02:46:09,597 --> 02:46:11,155
Someone sent her here.

1394
02:46:11,498 --> 02:46:12,658
You met?

1395
02:46:15,936 --> 02:46:17,267
She's very fine.

1396
02:46:27,948 --> 02:46:29,472
My dearest dear...

1397
02:46:30,150 --> 02:46:32,675
...I am sending this to Larissa Antipova...

1398
02:46:32,920 --> 02:46:35,684
...because if you are alive,
which God grant...

1399
02:46:36,190 --> 02:46:38,181
...I think that is where you will go.

1400
02:46:39,159 --> 02:46:41,821
We have a little daughter, Yuri,
did you know?

1401
02:46:42,897 --> 02:46:44,364
Her name is Anna.

1402
02:46:44,932 --> 02:46:46,559
Father sends greetings.

1403
02:46:47,201 --> 02:46:49,032
Sasha has grown quite a lot.

1404
02:46:49,303 --> 02:46:50,770
He is quite big now.

1405
02:46:51,739 --> 02:46:55,368
Whenever we speak of you
he weeps and won't be comforted.

1406
02:46:56,477 --> 02:46:58,468
This is what I have to tell you.

1407
02:46:58,579 --> 02:47:00,706
We are being deported from Russia.

1408
02:47:01,415 --> 02:47:04,407
We can't make out
if you would be allowed to join us.

1409
02:47:04,985 --> 02:47:07,510
An organization in Paris
which I mustn't name...

1410
02:47:07,588 --> 02:47:09,180
...will know where we are...

1411
02:47:09,256 --> 02:47:11,986
...but nothing is certain
and there is very little time.

1412
02:47:12,059 --> 02:47:13,822
I am writing this in haste.

1413
02:47:14,662 --> 02:47:16,425
They are coming for us now.

1414
02:47:16,830 --> 02:47:18,058
God bless you.

1415
02:47:19,199 --> 02:47:22,362
I must honestly admit
that Antipova is a good person.

1416
02:47:33,614 --> 02:47:36,947
Yuri, when they got away to Moscow,
she left something here.

1417
02:48:14,054 --> 02:48:15,112
Yuri!

1418
02:48:40,714 --> 02:48:41,976
May I come in?

1419
02:48:44,451 --> 02:48:47,011
Yuri Andreyevich, you've changed, I think.

1420
02:48:48,489 --> 02:48:50,184
Oh, yes, decidedly.

1421
02:48:51,992 --> 02:48:53,050
Larissa...

1422
02:48:55,162 --> 02:48:56,754
...remarkably the same.

1423
02:49:04,571 --> 02:49:06,004
I came from Moscow.

1424
02:49:07,341 --> 02:49:09,241
I'm on my way to Vladivostock.

1425
02:49:17,084 --> 02:49:18,984
I'm here to offer you my help.

1426
02:49:19,053 --> 02:49:20,543
We don't want it.

1427
02:49:20,754 --> 02:49:22,085
Speak for yourself.

1428
02:49:22,156 --> 02:49:23,487
We don't want it.

1429
02:49:23,857 --> 02:49:27,588
Yuri Andreyevich, you spent two years
with the Partisans, Fifth Division.

1430
02:49:27,661 --> 02:49:30,221
You have no discharge
so you are a deserter.

1431
02:49:30,397 --> 02:49:34,163
Your family in Paris is involved
in a dangerous migr organization.

1432
02:49:34,368 --> 02:49:36,427
Now all these are technicalities.

1433
02:49:37,438 --> 02:49:39,133
But your style of life...

1434
02:49:39,206 --> 02:49:41,140
...everything you say and think...

1435
02:49:41,208 --> 02:49:44,644
...your published writings
are all flagrantly subversive.

1436
02:49:44,912 --> 02:49:46,504
Your days are numbered.

1437
02:49:47,081 --> 02:49:48,446
Unless I help you.

1438
02:49:49,183 --> 02:49:50,810
Do you want my help?

1439
02:49:51,785 --> 02:49:52,717
No.

1440
02:49:53,787 --> 02:49:54,879
Wait, Yuri.

1441
02:50:00,327 --> 02:50:02,227
Larissa, three glasses.

1442
02:50:02,863 --> 02:50:03,887
No!

1443
02:50:04,598 --> 02:50:07,465
Yuri, you must see how serious this is.

1444
02:50:11,071 --> 02:50:12,971
Please don't underestimate me.

1445
02:50:13,307 --> 02:50:16,799
Practically, or morally,
I am not the man you take me for.

1446
02:50:19,012 --> 02:50:21,207
How do you know all this about Yuri?

1447
02:50:21,615 --> 02:50:22,946
How can you help?

1448
02:50:23,484 --> 02:50:25,816
I do and I can. Isn't that sufficient?

1449
02:50:26,186 --> 02:50:27,175
No.

1450
02:50:29,423 --> 02:50:30,685
Sant, Larissa.

1451
02:50:41,535 --> 02:50:44,026
Our eastern seaboard is
an undeveloped area.

1452
02:50:45,272 --> 02:50:49,766
The Commissariat of Foreign Affairs wants
to establish an independent state there.

1453
02:50:50,344 --> 02:50:54,405
It affords us a temporary channel
of communication with the outside world.

1454
02:50:55,215 --> 02:50:57,945
I've good contacts in the Far East.

1455
02:50:59,286 --> 02:51:01,846
I've been appointed the minister of justice.

1456
02:51:02,289 --> 02:51:03,722
The Bolsheviks trust you?

1457
02:51:03,790 --> 02:51:07,282
They trust no one.
They've found me useful.

1458
02:51:12,399 --> 02:51:14,094
Here's how I can help you.

1459
02:51:14,902 --> 02:51:15,891
You...

1460
02:51:16,770 --> 02:51:19,068
You come with me
as far as the Pacific Coast.

1461
02:51:19,139 --> 02:51:21,573
And from there you can go where you like.

1462
02:51:22,409 --> 02:51:23,876
To Paris.

1463
02:51:23,944 --> 02:51:24,933
Or not.

1464
02:51:25,946 --> 02:51:27,607
I think you'd better go.

1465
02:51:28,248 --> 02:51:32,378
Your rarified selfishness is intolerable.

1466
02:51:33,320 --> 02:51:35,049
Larissa's in danger, too.

1467
02:51:35,889 --> 02:51:37,516
By association with me?

1468
02:51:37,624 --> 02:51:40,718
No. Not by association with you.
You're small fry.

1469
02:51:41,828 --> 02:51:43,921
By association with Strelnikov.

1470
02:51:44,398 --> 02:51:45,956
I've never met Strelnikov.

1471
02:51:46,033 --> 02:51:48,593
You're married to Strelnikov.
They know that.

1472
02:51:49,069 --> 02:51:50,969
I was married to Pasha Antipov.

1473
02:51:51,038 --> 02:51:54,565
I understand, I understand.
But they don't.

1474
02:51:55,375 --> 02:51:56,865
You're being watched.

1475
02:51:58,111 --> 02:51:59,442
Do you know why?

1476
02:52:00,914 --> 02:52:04,441
A husband is a sticky commodity, my dear.

1477
02:52:05,852 --> 02:52:07,046
Go away!

1478
02:52:09,890 --> 02:52:13,189
More of your high-minded lunacy.

1479
02:52:14,661 --> 02:52:16,526
You have a child to think of.

1480
02:52:17,130 --> 02:52:18,188
Look here.

1481
02:52:19,266 --> 02:52:20,324
Here.

1482
02:52:20,834 --> 02:52:22,392
That's sugar for the child.

1483
02:52:22,469 --> 02:52:23,800
I don't want it.

1484
02:52:25,205 --> 02:52:27,070
You'd refuse my sugar?

1485
02:52:28,575 --> 02:52:30,668
Who are you to refuse me anything?

1486
02:52:30,911 --> 02:52:32,003
Now you go!

1487
02:52:36,283 --> 02:52:37,614
- I came...
- Go!

1488
02:52:38,685 --> 02:52:39,709
Go!

1489
02:52:41,388 --> 02:52:43,652
I came to you in good faith.

1490
02:52:49,029 --> 02:52:51,497
You stay here then and get your desserts!

1491
02:52:55,202 --> 02:52:57,102
Your desserts, do you hear me?

1492
02:53:01,141 --> 02:53:03,006
You think you're immaculate.

1493
02:53:07,381 --> 02:53:08,939
You're not immaculate!

1494
02:53:11,318 --> 02:53:12,512
I know you!

1495
02:53:14,488 --> 02:53:16,149
Do you hear me?

1496
02:53:16,957 --> 02:53:21,519
We're all made of the same clay, you know.

1497
02:53:23,230 --> 02:53:24,288
Clay!

1498
02:53:25,832 --> 02:53:27,493
Clay!

1499
02:53:32,439 --> 02:53:33,531
Lara.

1500
02:53:36,643 --> 02:53:38,133
He's rubbish, Lara.

1501
02:53:39,713 --> 02:53:41,180
Yes, rubbish.

1502
02:53:43,917 --> 02:53:45,680
I wish he'd never happened.

1503
02:53:46,553 --> 02:53:47,884
Does it matter?

1504
02:53:48,889 --> 02:53:50,186
Doesn't it?

1505
02:53:50,624 --> 02:53:51,682
Not to me.

1506
02:54:01,601 --> 02:54:04,035
What shall we do? Can we get on a train?

1507
02:54:04,604 --> 02:54:06,663
No, they'd arrest us on the spot.

1508
02:54:07,574 --> 02:54:09,735
I don't want to stay here and wait.

1509
02:54:10,043 --> 02:54:11,032
No.

1510
02:54:13,780 --> 02:54:14,769
Listen.

1511
02:54:16,316 --> 02:54:18,250
- We could go to...
- Varykino.

1512
02:54:20,921 --> 02:54:22,912
They'd find out sooner or later.

1513
02:54:23,457 --> 02:54:24,719
Yes, but later.

1514
02:54:25,525 --> 02:54:27,686
And if our days are really numbered, Yuri...

1515
02:54:27,761 --> 02:54:30,127
Yes. We'd better live them.

1516
02:54:33,033 --> 02:54:34,762
Before we're parted.

1517
02:54:35,569 --> 02:54:36,558
Yes.

1518
02:57:15,829 --> 02:57:19,321
Anna taught me to write at this desk.

1519
03:01:14,134 --> 03:01:15,624
This isn't me, Yuri.

1520
03:01:17,003 --> 03:01:18,095
Yes, it is.

1521
03:01:19,072 --> 03:01:20,096
No.

1522
03:01:21,474 --> 03:01:22,463
It's you.

1523
03:01:28,014 --> 03:01:29,072
"Lara."

1524
03:02:19,365 --> 03:02:20,389
Yuri!

1525
03:02:21,501 --> 03:02:23,401
Yuri, there's a wolf howling!

1526
03:02:23,603 --> 03:02:25,298
Oh, yes.

1527
03:02:29,409 --> 03:02:32,537
I've seen them. They're frightened.
They won't harm us.

1528
03:02:32,979 --> 03:02:34,913
Yes. I know.

1529
03:02:36,382 --> 03:02:37,440
I'm sorry.

1530
03:02:46,492 --> 03:02:49,552
Oh, Lord, this is an awful time to be alive.

1531
03:02:50,163 --> 03:02:51,152
No.

1532
03:02:51,264 --> 03:02:52,663
It is. Oh, it is!

1533
03:02:52,732 --> 03:02:53,721
No. No.

1534
03:03:59,532 --> 03:04:01,898
Wouldn't it have been lovely
if we'd met before?

1535
03:04:01,968 --> 03:04:03,230
Before we did?

1536
03:04:04,370 --> 03:04:05,359
Yes.

1537
03:04:07,941 --> 03:04:10,774
We'd have got married
and had a house and children.

1538
03:04:14,147 --> 03:04:17,981
If we'd had children, Yuri,
would you have liked a boy or a girl?

1539
03:04:19,419 --> 03:04:23,412
I think we may go mad,
if we think about all that.

1540
03:04:24,090 --> 03:04:26,058
I shall always think about it.

1541
03:04:27,527 --> 03:04:29,757
- Will you write today?
- No, not today.

1542
03:04:49,515 --> 03:04:50,504
Katya!

1543
03:04:52,385 --> 03:04:53,875
Come to me, darling.

1544
03:05:06,933 --> 03:05:07,922
Victor!

1545
03:05:09,702 --> 03:05:11,135
We thought it was...

1546
03:05:12,638 --> 03:05:13,627
Quiet.

1547
03:05:16,142 --> 03:05:18,201
I wonder if you'd mind, Comrades?

1548
03:05:22,782 --> 03:05:25,876
There's a train belonging
to my government standing in Yuriatin.

1549
03:05:25,952 --> 03:05:28,580
It has a carriage for myself
and my assistants.

1550
03:05:28,721 --> 03:05:31,554
You would travel in comfort and safety.

1551
03:05:31,824 --> 03:05:34,054
There's no question.
I'm not going with you.

1552
03:05:34,127 --> 03:05:37,187
I'm not going without you.
So, there's an end to it.

1553
03:05:37,830 --> 03:05:40,993
Well, then, I'll have to speak
to Yuri Andreyevich in private.

1554
03:05:56,682 --> 03:05:58,172
Strelnikov is dead.

1555
03:05:59,018 --> 03:05:59,882
What?

1556
03:05:59,952 --> 03:06:02,113
Spare me your expressions of regret.

1557
03:06:02,255 --> 03:06:05,747
He was a murderous neurotic
and no loss to anyone.

1558
03:06:06,659 --> 03:06:08,820
Do you see how this affects Larissa?

1559
03:06:09,162 --> 03:06:10,220
You don't.

1560
03:06:11,330 --> 03:06:12,558
You're a fool.

1561
03:06:17,270 --> 03:06:18,760
She's Strelnikov's wife.

1562
03:06:18,838 --> 03:06:22,103
Why do you think they haven't
arrested her? Is this the usual practice?

1563
03:06:22,175 --> 03:06:24,643
Why do you think
they had her watched in Yuriatin?

1564
03:06:24,710 --> 03:06:26,803
They were waiting for Strelnikov.

1565
03:06:27,180 --> 03:06:29,978
If they thought that he would
come running to his wife...

1566
03:06:30,049 --> 03:06:31,448
...they didn't know him.

1567
03:06:31,517 --> 03:06:32,916
They knew him well enough.

1568
03:06:32,985 --> 03:06:35,977
He was only five miles from here
when they caught him.

1569
03:06:36,189 --> 03:06:39,317
He was arrested on the open road.
He didn't conceal his identity.

1570
03:06:39,392 --> 03:06:42,759
Throughout the entire interview,
he insisted they call him Pavel Antipov...

1571
03:06:42,829 --> 03:06:46,492
...which is his right name, and refused
to answer to the name of Strelnikov.

1572
03:06:46,599 --> 03:06:49,568
On his way to execution,
he took a pistol from one of the guards...

1573
03:06:49,635 --> 03:06:51,296
...and blew his own brains out.

1574
03:06:51,938 --> 03:06:53,303
Oh, my God!

1575
03:06:55,308 --> 03:06:56,536
Don't tell Lara this.

1576
03:06:56,876 --> 03:06:59,538
I think I know Lara at least as well as you.

1577
03:06:59,612 --> 03:07:02,945
But don't you see her position?
She's served her purpose.

1578
03:07:03,182 --> 03:07:05,616
These men that came with me today
as an escort...

1579
03:07:05,685 --> 03:07:08,745
...will come for her and the child tomorrow,
as a firing squad.

1580
03:07:09,222 --> 03:07:11,850
Now, I know exactly what you think of me.

1581
03:07:11,958 --> 03:07:13,016
And why.

1582
03:07:13,693 --> 03:07:16,526
But if you're not coming with me,
she's not coming with me.

1583
03:07:17,463 --> 03:07:19,454
So, are you coming with me?

1584
03:07:20,032 --> 03:07:22,694
Do you accept the protection
of this ignoble Caliban...

1585
03:07:22,768 --> 03:07:25,635
...on any terms that Caliban cares to make?

1586
03:07:26,072 --> 03:07:31,772
Or, is your delicacy so exorbitant that you
would sacrifice a woman and a child to it?

1587
03:07:41,387 --> 03:07:43,719
There are some bags to carry, Comrades.

1588
03:08:00,540 --> 03:08:01,598
Get in!

1589
03:08:06,512 --> 03:08:07,501
Come.

1590
03:08:11,751 --> 03:08:13,048
- How many?
- All of us.

1591
03:08:13,119 --> 03:08:14,450
Sorry, not enough room.

1592
03:08:14,520 --> 03:08:16,351
Comrade, there's got to be room.

1593
03:08:16,422 --> 03:08:18,583
It's all right, I have to bring our sledge.

1594
03:08:18,658 --> 03:08:21,752
Hurry. This train can't wait.
There are important people on it.

1595
03:08:21,827 --> 03:08:23,590
You start, I'll catch you up.

1596
03:08:29,735 --> 03:08:31,066
Right, Comrades!

1597
03:08:33,573 --> 03:08:34,904
We'll see you.

1598
03:08:35,908 --> 03:08:37,068
Hurry!

1599
03:10:12,805 --> 03:10:16,138
I'm afraid that's it, my dear.
Your young man's not coming.

1600
03:10:16,742 --> 03:10:17,731
You fool!

1601
03:10:19,078 --> 03:10:21,672
Did you really think
he would come with you?

1602
03:10:31,123 --> 03:10:32,590
The man's an idiot.

1603
03:10:34,660 --> 03:10:36,821
From Mongolia
he could have gone to China.

1604
03:10:36,896 --> 03:10:38,488
He'll never leave Russia.

1605
03:10:38,564 --> 03:10:41,226
Let him stay.
You've come with me, haven't you?

1606
03:10:42,735 --> 03:10:43,702
Yes.

1607
03:10:45,371 --> 03:10:47,862
To be sure, it was your duty as a mother.

1608
03:10:49,108 --> 03:10:50,632
That's right, Victor.

1609
03:10:53,479 --> 03:10:55,504
I'm carrying Yuri's child.

1610
03:11:01,220 --> 03:11:04,553
I was born out there,
in the Far East, somewhere.

1611
03:11:04,990 --> 03:11:07,584
I think it was Mongolia. I don't remember.

1612
03:11:07,660 --> 03:11:10,561
You were born in Mongolia.
And you were born that very year.

1613
03:11:10,629 --> 03:11:12,494
So were a lot of other children.

1614
03:11:12,565 --> 03:11:16,057
Not many called Tonya, bearing the name
Komarov, or Komarovsky.

1615
03:11:16,302 --> 03:11:18,270
Komarov's a common name. So is Tonya.

1616
03:11:18,337 --> 03:11:20,965
With fair hair and blue eyes,
lost at the age of eight...

1617
03:11:21,040 --> 03:11:23,406
...when the civil war broke out
in the Far East.

1618
03:11:23,476 --> 03:11:25,444
There's something you haven't told me.

1619
03:11:25,511 --> 03:11:27,411
How did you come to be lost?

1620
03:11:28,013 --> 03:11:29,241
I can't remember.

1621
03:11:29,315 --> 03:11:31,374
I don't believe that.
You must remember something.

1622
03:11:31,450 --> 03:11:32,280
No!

1623
03:11:34,086 --> 03:11:36,316
Shall I tell you
how I first met your mother?

1624
03:11:36,389 --> 03:11:38,357
If she was my mother, Comrade General.

1625
03:11:38,424 --> 03:11:39,448
You doubt it?

1626
03:11:39,625 --> 03:11:42,992
I picked my brother up, literally picked
him up, on a Moscow street.

1627
03:11:43,062 --> 03:11:46,554
He had a fourth-class ration book
and he was undernourished.

1628
03:11:46,799 --> 03:11:49,267
He didn't seem to mind that, or anything.

1629
03:11:49,668 --> 03:11:52,102
I thought he was a happier man than me.

1630
03:11:53,472 --> 03:11:55,702
He suffered me to buy him a new suit.

1631
03:11:56,509 --> 03:11:58,977
And to get him a job at his old hospital.

1632
03:11:59,812 --> 03:12:02,144
I saw him off for his first day's work.

1633
03:12:02,548 --> 03:12:07,042
This was eight years
after he and Lara parted.

1634
03:12:08,621 --> 03:12:10,179
So, he never saw her again?

1635
03:12:15,327 --> 03:12:17,693
Thank you. You've been very kind to me.

1636
03:12:24,804 --> 03:12:28,797
He must have known how ill he was.
The walls of his heart were like paper.

1637
03:12:29,241 --> 03:12:33,234
But, he kept it to himself.
He kept a lot to himself.

1638
03:12:58,204 --> 03:12:59,193
Please!

1639
03:14:05,471 --> 03:14:08,634
I was astonished at the extent
of his reputation.

1640
03:14:09,508 --> 03:14:13,740
His work was unobtainable at the time.
It was disapproved of by the Party.

1641
03:14:14,580 --> 03:14:17,242
But, if people love poetry, they love poets.

1642
03:14:18,250 --> 03:14:20,150
And nobody loves poetry like a Russian.

1643
03:14:30,663 --> 03:14:32,096
Excuse me, Comrade.

1644
03:14:33,365 --> 03:14:34,696
Are you Yevgraf?

1645
03:14:35,901 --> 03:14:37,163
My name's Lara.

1646
03:14:37,503 --> 03:14:39,528
I knew her name from the Lara poems...

1647
03:14:39,605 --> 03:14:42,267
...which I'd found
among my brother's manuscripts.

1648
03:14:43,008 --> 03:14:44,532
I knew your brother.

1649
03:14:46,312 --> 03:14:47,711
I need your help.

1650
03:14:48,314 --> 03:14:50,942
She'd come to Moscow
to look for her child.

1651
03:14:51,383 --> 03:14:53,351
I helped her as far as I could.

1652
03:14:57,089 --> 03:14:58,886
But, I knew it was hopeless.

1653
03:15:04,797 --> 03:15:07,197
I think I was a little in love with her.

1654
03:15:15,741 --> 03:15:18,266
One day she went away
and didn't come back.

1655
03:15:18,811 --> 03:15:21,439
She died, or vanished, somewhere...

1656
03:15:21,513 --> 03:15:23,481
...in one of the labor camps...

1657
03:15:23,882 --> 03:15:27,716
...a nameless number on a list
that was afterwards mislaid.

1658
03:15:28,988 --> 03:15:31,320
That was quite common in those days.

1659
03:15:41,734 --> 03:15:43,634
How did you come to be lost?

1660
03:15:45,604 --> 03:15:47,834
- We were running in the street.
- We?

1661
03:15:47,906 --> 03:15:50,466
- My father.
- Not your father, Komarovsky.

1662
03:15:50,542 --> 03:15:51,736
I don't know.

1663
03:15:52,378 --> 03:15:54,107
The street was under fire.

1664
03:15:54,346 --> 03:15:57,838
There were explosions
and the houses were falling down...

1665
03:15:59,918 --> 03:16:01,715
...and he let go of my hand.

1666
03:16:03,555 --> 03:16:05,045
He let go of my hand.

1667
03:16:07,126 --> 03:16:08,388
And I was lost.

1668
03:16:12,097 --> 03:16:13,997
Would a father have done that?

1669
03:16:14,500 --> 03:16:17,492
Oh, yes, people will do anything.

1670
03:16:17,870 --> 03:16:19,235
It was Komarovsky.

1671
03:16:22,908 --> 03:16:26,309
This man was your father.

1672
03:16:28,881 --> 03:16:30,576
Why won't you believe it?

1673
03:16:31,850 --> 03:16:33,715
Don't you want to believe it?

1674
03:16:34,620 --> 03:16:36,349
Not if it isn't true.

1675
03:16:40,159 --> 03:16:41,490
That's inherited.

1676
03:16:41,960 --> 03:16:45,623
Comrade General, when I was a child,
I wanted parents.

1677
03:16:46,865 --> 03:16:49,197
You can imagine how I wanted parents.

1678
03:16:50,803 --> 03:16:54,500
I wanted to die when I was a child,
you know?

1679
03:16:58,243 --> 03:16:59,608
Now, I don't know.

1680
03:17:01,847 --> 03:17:04,475
I can't be of any use to them, now, can I?

1681
03:17:05,451 --> 03:17:07,942
I was hoping I might be
of some use to you.

1682
03:17:10,355 --> 03:17:12,016
Will you think about it?

1683
03:17:12,124 --> 03:17:13,113
Yes.

1684
03:17:19,064 --> 03:17:20,622
It's all right, David.

1685
03:17:24,136 --> 03:17:25,228
Do you work here?

1686
03:17:25,304 --> 03:17:27,101
Yes, Comrade General. I'm an operator.

1687
03:17:27,172 --> 03:17:28,662
And what do you operate?

1688
03:17:30,075 --> 03:17:31,064
That!

1689
03:17:46,992 --> 03:17:48,823
You've promised to think about it.

1690
03:18:01,974 --> 03:18:02,963
Tonya!

1691
03:18:04,877 --> 03:18:06,538
Can you play the balalaika?

1692
03:18:06,812 --> 03:18:08,006
Can she play?

1693
03:18:08,514 --> 03:18:09,845
She's an artist!

1694
03:18:10,048 --> 03:18:12,346
An artist? Who taught you?

1695
03:18:13,152 --> 03:18:14,710
No one taught her.

1696
03:18:16,789 --> 03:18:18,154
Then, it's a gift.

1697
03:18:19,305 --> 03:18:25,472
