3
00:00:38,781 --> 00:00:40,441
Heads, you live.

4
00:00:41,743 --> 00:00:43,735
Tails, you die.

5
00:00:46,622 --> 00:00:49,708
Tails, you die.

6
00:00:51,249 --> 00:00:54,537
My name is Domino Harvey.

7
00:00:54,627 --> 00:00:56,916
I am a bounty hunter.

8
00:00:59,341 --> 00:01:01,299
What I say
over the next several hours

9
00:01:01,386 --> 00:01:04,672
will determine whether or not
I spend the rest of my life in prison.

10
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,342
Tails, you die.

11
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:10,928
Miss Harvey, my name is Taryn Mills.

12
00:01:11,021 --> 00:01:13,976
I'm a criminal psychologist
working for the FBI.

13
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:16,272
I'm here to ask you
a few questions.

14
00:01:17,486 --> 00:01:18,399
Here's the part

15
00:01:18,487 --> 00:01:20,029
where I'm supposed
to get all defensive

16
00:01:20,114 --> 00:01:23,235
and say, "Not until
I speak with my attorney."

17
00:01:25,078 --> 00:01:26,905
I'll tell you everything I know.

18
00:01:29,249 --> 00:01:31,372
36 hours ago,
10 million dollars was stolen

19
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,453
from an armoured car that
was subsequently found

20
00:01:33,545 --> 00:01:35,371
abandoned at the Hoover Dam.

21
00:01:42,556 --> 00:01:44,633
The driver's name was Locus Fender.

22
00:01:46,143 --> 00:01:48,681
We know that he was in on the heist.

23
00:01:48,771 --> 00:01:51,309
We know that
he was in on the heist.

24
00:01:52,233 --> 00:01:54,191
Is it true that you were hired

25
00:01:54,278 --> 00:01:56,270
to track down
and capture the thieves

26
00:01:56,363 --> 00:01:58,106
and then deliver them to Drake Bishop,

27
00:01:58,198 --> 00:02:00,357
owner of the Stratosphere
Hotel and Casino?

28
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,619
Yes.

29
00:02:04,246 --> 00:02:05,076
You then learned

30
00:02:05,164 --> 00:02:07,120
where the thieves
had hidden the money.

31
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:10,452
And at the instructions
of your employer,

32
00:02:10,544 --> 00:02:12,585
went to retrieve the money yourself.

33
00:02:13,423 --> 00:02:15,996
We were sent out
to the Fender Compound...

34
00:02:16,592 --> 00:02:18,632
in the desert near the chicken ranch.

35
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,304
This way.

36
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:44,283
All right, on my go.

37
00:02:45,205 --> 00:02:46,995
Watch your ass on this one.

38
00:02:47,873 --> 00:02:49,284
Go.

39
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,643
Sic 'em, boy! Sic 'em!

40
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:17,569
Fuck!

41
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,526
Chi Chi?

42
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:23,822
That's my best friend.

43
00:03:24,498 --> 00:03:26,952
His name is Choco.
He's always fancied me,

44
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,711
but too shy to ever
do anything about it.

45
00:03:30,962 --> 00:03:32,754
Chi Chi!

46
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:36,636
Edna, Chi Chi's in doggie hell.

47
00:03:37,887 --> 00:03:39,429
All we want is the money.

48
00:03:39,513 --> 00:03:40,794
That's Ed Moseby,

49
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,761
the most legendary bounty hunter
in all of Los Angeles.

50
00:03:43,851 --> 00:03:46,225
He's my boss, my mentor,

51
00:03:46,314 --> 00:03:48,104
the father I never had.

52
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,525
Chi Chi!

53
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:56,194
My poor Chi Chi!

54
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,409
The Manchurian Candidate,
eh, Edna?

55
00:04:03,707 --> 00:04:05,616
Is that you, Domino?

56
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:07,618
Nice to see you, darling.

57
00:04:08,044 --> 00:04:10,414
Your father must be so proud

58
00:04:11,712 --> 00:04:14,001
of what's become of his little angel.

59
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,750
Listen, bitch, we've got your son!

60
00:04:15,842 --> 00:04:18,462
If you don't give us the money,
we're gonna wax his fucking ass!

61
00:04:18,552 --> 00:04:20,379
You don't have shit!

62
00:04:21,055 --> 00:04:22,430
Hey, Choco.

63
00:04:24,684 --> 00:04:26,477
Show her.

64
00:04:39,033 --> 00:04:41,073
He's still alive, Edna!

65
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,035
Prove it!

66
00:04:43,122 --> 00:04:45,162
Choco, go get him.

67
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:03,058
Last question for 20 pounds.

68
00:05:03,143 --> 00:05:05,385
Start the clock. Zack, in anatomy,

69
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:07,972
a human being is usually
born with how many toes?

70
00:05:08,066 --> 00:05:09,857
We got to show Edna her son.

71
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,284
That's our driver Alf.

72
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,864
He's from Afghanistan.

73
00:05:21,664 --> 00:05:23,491
He once ate a cat.

74
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,620
We can't understand how to
pronounce his fucking name,

75
00:05:27,712 --> 00:05:30,333
so we just call him
the cat eating alien.

76
00:05:38,766 --> 00:05:40,224
What does that mean?

77
00:05:40,309 --> 00:05:42,136
Shut the fuck up.

78
00:06:16,345 --> 00:06:18,468
How did Locus Fender lose his arm?

79
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,972
He had the combination
to the safe tattooed on it.

80
00:06:25,063 --> 00:06:26,807
Mama! Mama!

81
00:06:27,524 --> 00:06:29,019
Locus!

82
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,390
Mama. Mama.

83
00:06:30,486 --> 00:06:32,194
Baby, I'm here!

84
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:34,237
Please. Please.

85
00:06:35,575 --> 00:06:37,817
You got to do as I say.

86
00:06:38,286 --> 00:06:41,157
Now, the combination is on my arm.

87
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,908
Mama, you got to get the decoder.

88
00:06:45,795 --> 00:06:47,503
Please, Mama.

89
00:06:48,297 --> 00:06:50,669
Put your weapon down!

90
00:06:51,842 --> 00:06:53,253
Put it down, Mama!

91
00:06:53,344 --> 00:06:54,921
Put your fucking weapon down!

92
00:07:17,663 --> 00:07:19,206
Time to start at the beginning.

93
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,658
Time to start at the beginning.

94
00:07:23,335 --> 00:07:25,293
I'm the boss.

95
00:07:25,922 --> 00:07:29,257
I'm already a cool
motherfucker, you know?

96
00:07:29,343 --> 00:07:30,916
I employ bounty hunters.

97
00:07:31,007 --> 00:07:32,335
I'm here today to speak

98
00:07:32,425 --> 00:07:35,130
for all the women of
mixed race in America.

99
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,548
I'm sorry?

100
00:07:37,764 --> 00:07:40,765
I will knock
you out! Number one!

101
00:07:44,688 --> 00:07:46,598
Where's my money?

102
00:07:48,318 --> 00:07:49,860
I fuckin' love that show.

103
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:27,975
Maybe one of you will survive.

104
00:08:49,885 --> 00:08:51,463
Now, Mama!

105
00:08:53,389 --> 00:08:55,014
Put your fucking weapon down!

106
00:09:07,571 --> 00:09:10,522
You got 10 minutes
to open that safe, Edna.

107
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:13,647
Fuck you!

108
00:09:15,368 --> 00:09:16,862
I've never killed anyone.

109
00:09:16,953 --> 00:09:21,283
I hope to never kill anyone,
even if they deserve it.

110
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:25,621
My agenda is to kick ass
and secure the bounty.

111
00:09:25,712 --> 00:09:29,663
If I'm on this side of the law,
I can live the low life and avoid jail.

112
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,543
I can live the nasty
and not do time for it.

113
00:09:33,846 --> 00:09:36,384
That's called
the best of both worlds.

114
00:09:36,474 --> 00:09:39,808
As for that other world,
that 90210 world,

115
00:09:39,894 --> 00:09:41,852
it's not for me.

116
00:09:48,738 --> 00:09:50,315
Is that him?

117
00:09:50,406 --> 00:09:52,364
Is that your dad?

118
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:55,072
My real father was an actor.

119
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,035
He died when I was a little girl.

120
00:09:57,122 --> 00:09:58,201
Hi, Ben.

121
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,414
What the hell are you doing?
What's the matter with you?

122
00:10:00,502 --> 00:10:02,910
Heh. I knew Frank.

123
00:10:03,005 --> 00:10:04,628
Who didn't?

124
00:10:05,423 --> 00:10:07,380
Hey, Edna...

125
00:10:07,467 --> 00:10:09,460
You know what, sweetheart?
You got, like, 7 minutes

126
00:10:09,553 --> 00:10:11,842
to open that goddamn freezer,

127
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:14,467
or I'm gonna flush that
fucking arm down the toilet.

128
00:10:14,557 --> 00:10:16,051
Fucker!

129
00:10:16,142 --> 00:10:18,183
You're probably
wondering how a girl like me

130
00:10:18,271 --> 00:10:20,762
arrived here, at the arse end
of the Nevada Desert

131
00:10:20,857 --> 00:10:24,521
with a blood-spattered Winnebago
and a one-armed man.

132
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:30,445
The Department of
Motor Vehicles in Los Angeles.

133
00:10:31,826 --> 00:10:34,033
His name is Frances.

134
00:10:34,121 --> 00:10:36,993
Mr 90210 college boy
had found himself

135
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,491
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

136
00:10:39,586 --> 00:10:41,413
Hey, yeah, what's up?

137
00:10:41,505 --> 00:10:42,536
OK.

138
00:10:42,631 --> 00:10:45,999
Look, I said,

139
00:10:46,092 --> 00:10:48,880
they're about to call
my number, like, any second.

140
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:51,293
Now, are you in, or are you out?

141
00:10:51,387 --> 00:10:55,680
OK. Make up your fucking mind, 'cause
they're about to call my number.

142
00:10:55,766 --> 00:11:00,345
Right now, 'cause they're about to call
my fucking number.

143
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,104
All right.

144
00:11:03,191 --> 00:11:04,898
We're on.

145
00:11:13,577 --> 00:11:17,622
Now serving GO86.

146
00:11:17,707 --> 00:11:19,996
Hey...

147
00:11:22,337 --> 00:11:24,130
Kee Kee?

148
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:36,641
Kee Kee said that
you could deliver the...

149
00:11:36,727 --> 00:11:39,645
the IDs tonight.

150
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,890
Lateesha... I need that web link.

151
00:11:42,985 --> 00:11:45,772
The JLo concert is
probably sold out already.

152
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:53,161
Kee Kee don't make the rules.

153
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:55,111
Listen...

154
00:11:56,164 --> 00:11:58,124
bitch...

155
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,374
I don't think you understand who
the fuck you're dealing with here.

156
00:12:06,427 --> 00:12:10,888
OK? Because I could make
your job disappear like that.

157
00:12:14,395 --> 00:12:16,720
Kee Kee said tonight.

158
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,482
Tonight, 8pm.

159
00:12:31,034 --> 00:12:32,991
Anything else?

160
00:12:35,497 --> 00:12:37,453
Nope.

161
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,581
Good-bye, Frances.

162
00:12:41,963 --> 00:12:44,288
Good-bye, Lateesha.

163
00:12:54,268 --> 00:12:55,928
Fuck 'em.

164
00:12:57,646 --> 00:12:59,722
Fuck 'em all.

165
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,273
Lateesha, Frances,
and the 4 fake IDs

166
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,983
is where it all went wrong.

167
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,196
Where's the money?

168
00:13:08,283 --> 00:13:10,157
I don't know.

169
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:18,998
I think that you're lying. I think you know
exactly where the money is.

170
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,092
I think you're trying to scare me
into falsely incriminating myself,

171
00:13:24,176 --> 00:13:26,086
and it's not going to work.

172
00:13:27,346 --> 00:13:31,807
This is your last chance. Once I walk
out that door, I can't help you.

173
00:13:36,606 --> 00:13:40,651
When I was a little girl, my
father told me that if you weren't careful,

174
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:45,113
you could lose everything you've ever
earned in life in a split second.

175
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,361
You have to know when to cash out.

176
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,638
Thank you.

177
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,218
He will wipe away
every tear from their eyes,

178
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,972
and death will be no more.

179
00:14:18,064 --> 00:14:20,057
Neither will mourning nor outcry

180
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:22,475
nor pain be any more.

181
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:25,862
The former things have passed away.

182
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,693
And, look...

183
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,611
I am with you all the days

184
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,906
until the conclusion
of the system of things.

185
00:14:44,928 --> 00:14:48,379
After Dad passed on, my
mum's agenda was to hit the town

186
00:14:48,473 --> 00:14:51,178
and find another husband
with a boatload of cash.

187
00:14:54,938 --> 00:14:57,097
Hello, Mr Stevens. How are you?

188
00:14:57,191 --> 00:15:00,191
- Good holidays?
- Absolutely. Thank you.

189
00:15:00,277 --> 00:15:03,481
Darling.
I love you, love you.

190
00:15:03,573 --> 00:15:06,527
- Bye. Got to go, got to go.
- Bye.

191
00:15:10,788 --> 00:15:13,280
She decided to sock me
and my goldfish Sammy away

192
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,999
in boarding school.

193
00:15:19,965 --> 00:15:22,966
A week later, Sammy died.

194
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:27,099
It was a pivotal moment in my life.

195
00:15:27,183 --> 00:15:31,394
I decided to never invest too much
emotion in one thing.

196
00:15:34,773 --> 00:15:38,025
It's always a set-up
to the pain of losing them.

197
00:16:01,465 --> 00:16:03,505
God created me
in His image.

198
00:16:13,688 --> 00:16:16,179
I guess
he had a thing for models.

199
00:16:16,274 --> 00:16:18,231
I guess
he had a thing for models.

200
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:21,567
Like most models,
I was bored with life.

201
00:16:21,654 --> 00:16:24,858
I hated everything and everyone.

202
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:33,035
If you think America
is dirt bag central,

203
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:36,874
clearly you've never been to the sleaze
nation of our Queen Mother.

204
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,509
I hope all this
is not gonna change you.

205
00:16:43,595 --> 00:16:47,096
One thing we'd like to change, though...
You said Ian's name wrong.

206
00:16:47,184 --> 00:16:50,350
- Right, it's "eye-an".
- Ian Ziering, not "ee-an" Ziering.

207
00:16:50,436 --> 00:16:52,346
It's "eye-an", since birth.

208
00:16:52,438 --> 00:16:55,642
Brilliant... Absolutely brilliant.

209
00:16:56,193 --> 00:16:59,029
Mum was determined
to move us to Beverly Hills.

210
00:16:59,113 --> 00:17:01,319
That damn show started it all.

211
00:17:01,407 --> 00:17:03,863
That damn show
started it all.

212
00:17:07,372 --> 00:17:10,954
She remarried to a man
named Mark Waldman.

213
00:17:12,251 --> 00:17:15,372
He invested in a restaurant
called the Hard Rock Cafe.

214
00:17:17,258 --> 00:17:20,922
Domino, Domino, give the goddamn
num chucks a rest already.

215
00:17:21,011 --> 00:17:23,087
It's time for supper. Come on, baby.

216
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,754
I tried
Beverly Hills High for a spell,

217
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,808
but it didn't work out.

218
00:17:27,895 --> 00:17:31,057
I hated them. I hated them all.

219
00:17:31,143 --> 00:17:34,478
5, 6, 7, 8!
We are Alpha Omega

220
00:17:34,565 --> 00:17:36,558
we are the AOPs...

221
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:40,316
College was even worse.
Mum convinced me to join a sorority.

222
00:17:40,405 --> 00:17:42,646
It was all fun and games at first.

223
00:17:42,739 --> 00:17:44,531
Then the hazing started.

224
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:54,702
This is fucking disgusting!

225
00:17:54,795 --> 00:17:57,630
Disgusting!

226
00:18:02,886 --> 00:18:05,972
Look at these mosquito bites.

227
00:18:08,478 --> 00:18:11,763
What's it like to have the body
of a 10-year-old boy?

228
00:18:15,526 --> 00:18:18,314
- Have you had a nose job?
- No.

229
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,458
A week later, I was expelled.

230
00:18:32,127 --> 00:18:35,461
In the end,
it all came down to fate...

231
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:40,716
An LA Weekly advert
strewn across the ground.

232
00:18:44,766 --> 00:18:47,388
Claremont Williams III...

233
00:18:47,477 --> 00:18:51,097
- Yeah!
- The legendary bail bondsman.

234
00:19:15,338 --> 00:19:18,588
I'm here for
the bounty hunter seminar.

235
00:19:24,681 --> 00:19:26,673
Cash?

236
00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:34,021
Keep the change.

237
00:19:42,535 --> 00:19:44,112
See, as a bail bondsman,

238
00:19:44,202 --> 00:19:47,489
I'm the go-between for
the court and the accused.

239
00:19:47,582 --> 00:19:49,326
For a 10% fee,

240
00:19:49,418 --> 00:19:52,288
I will guarantee the amount
set by the court.

241
00:19:52,379 --> 00:19:53,789
Now...

242
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,549
if the defendant should fail to appear

243
00:19:56,633 --> 00:19:58,542
at his or her court date,

244
00:19:58,635 --> 00:20:03,097
I will bring in a bounty hunter
to recapture the defendant,

245
00:20:03,183 --> 00:20:06,883
or I will face having to repay
the court costs myself,

246
00:20:06,978 --> 00:20:11,058
which... we can't do.

247
00:20:13,027 --> 00:20:16,111
Now, this occurs most...

248
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:22,405
frequently when the collateral

249
00:20:22,496 --> 00:20:25,413
or the guarantee
given to the bondsman

250
00:20:25,498 --> 00:20:30,790
turns out to be worthless
or difficult to liquidate.

251
00:20:31,422 --> 00:20:35,004
So... in layman's terms,

252
00:20:35,091 --> 00:20:38,758
we get 10% of the bail.

253
00:20:38,847 --> 00:20:41,848
Now, in the next few moments,

254
00:20:41,933 --> 00:20:45,218
Ed Moseby will take the podium,
and he will begin the seminar

255
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:47,387
on how to become a bounty hunter.

256
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,680
In the meantime, feel free to take
a coffee break, pee break, whatever.

257
00:20:50,772 --> 00:20:53,443
We'll be starting
in the next few minutes.

258
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:00,364
Hey, how about it? Want to ride
some bounty hunter cock?

259
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:04,069
- Fuck you, dickhead.
- Bitch!

260
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:06,914
Excuse the fuck out of us!

261
00:21:15,257 --> 00:21:17,334
We got to ditch this thing.

262
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,963
Gentlemen...

263
00:21:21,055 --> 00:21:23,428
it has been a pleasure.

264
00:21:24,892 --> 00:21:28,559
All right, bathroom window, 5minutes.

265
00:21:28,647 --> 00:21:30,854
I'll keep the engine running.

266
00:21:40,452 --> 00:21:42,860
Nobody really knows
where Ed came from.

267
00:21:42,955 --> 00:21:45,707
This much is clear...
the man's been places,

268
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:48,627
seen things, lived life.

269
00:21:48,711 --> 00:21:51,285
He did a term in Soledad
and a term in Angola,

270
00:21:51,381 --> 00:21:54,335
where he lost a toe during a prison riot.

271
00:21:54,426 --> 00:21:56,916
The man's a warrior.

272
00:22:15,907 --> 00:22:18,400
To say that Choco is
the product of a broken home

273
00:22:18,495 --> 00:22:21,068
is to presume a home existed
in the first place.

274
00:22:21,164 --> 00:22:25,114
No. Choco never had a home.
Well, not unless you count

275
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,036
10 or so juvenile
correction facilities,

276
00:22:27,128 --> 00:22:29,121
where he spent his childhood.

277
00:22:36,384 --> 00:22:38,377
Mierda! Damn!

278
00:22:41,891 --> 00:22:43,682
Goddamn!

279
00:22:45,061 --> 00:22:47,218
Puta...

280
00:22:47,312 --> 00:22:50,564
- What the fuck is this?
- Where the fuck are you going?

281
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:53,189
Those people paid for a seminar!

282
00:22:54,822 --> 00:22:56,613
Where do you get off
fucking up my windshield?

283
00:22:56,699 --> 00:22:59,404
I want a job!

284
00:23:02,539 --> 00:23:04,911
Jesus fuckin' Christ, lady.

285
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,538
Everybody wants a goddamn job.

286
00:23:08,462 --> 00:23:11,748
What makes you think you
can do this one?

287
00:23:15,011 --> 00:23:17,584
I've been training since I was 12.

288
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,922
Knives, guns, throwing stars.

289
00:23:20,015 --> 00:23:23,599
You name it, I can fight with it.
I'm a hard worker. I'm a hard worker.

290
00:23:23,686 --> 00:23:28,147
I'm fast to learn, and nothing scares me.
I'm not afraid to die.

291
00:23:33,405 --> 00:23:35,529
Why would a...

292
00:23:35,616 --> 00:23:40,195
delicate little thing like you
want to be a goddamn bounty hunter?

293
00:23:41,207 --> 00:23:43,994
I want to have a little fun.

294
00:23:47,546 --> 00:23:49,872
You want to have a little fun?

295
00:23:53,469 --> 00:23:56,175
Well, little girl, you want a job?

296
00:23:56,264 --> 00:23:58,056
Yeah.

297
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,719
It's gonna cost you a new windshield.

298
00:24:00,811 --> 00:24:04,311
You know what? Enough of that
"little girl" shit. The name is Domino.

299
00:24:05,233 --> 00:24:07,190
Domino.

300
00:24:07,734 --> 00:24:11,147
- Domino what?
- No, just Domino.

301
00:24:11,276 --> 00:24:13,435
Let's take a ride.

302
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:14,561
Que?

303
00:24:28,003 --> 00:24:31,420
The kid's name is Hector Maldonado,
19 years old.

304
00:24:31,967 --> 00:24:36,510
His mother posted bail for him,
after he was arrested for a drive-by.

305
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,137
He speaks perfect fuckin' English.
He just thinks it's cute

306
00:24:43,228 --> 00:24:45,767
when he's around
a good-looking woman.

307
00:24:55,617 --> 00:24:58,025
Hey. Yeah, listen.

308
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,821
Louise, listen,
you can make this easy,

309
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:04,373
or you can make it real complicated.

310
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,298
For 200 dollars, Louise gave us
her boyfriend's whereabouts

311
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:11,833
at the local gang banger hangout
across the street.

312
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:25,015
What's his problem?

313
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:29,106
Latin petulance. Hold on.
Give me a minute with him.

314
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:33,571
All right, come on,
princess, spit it out.

315
00:25:35,703 --> 00:25:38,954
Why do we need that bitch on the
team? You don't like what I'm doing?

316
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:42,161
I can hear you.

317
00:25:42,253 --> 00:25:45,836
Hey, baby, why don't you take a walk
and let me handle this?

318
00:25:46,257 --> 00:25:49,871
First, she ain't on the team yet.

319
00:25:49,964 --> 00:25:51,673
OK?

320
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:54,249
Second of all,

321
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,385
take a look at her.

322
00:25:56,556 --> 00:25:59,226
I mean, come on, man, she ain't ugly.

323
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:02,015
You and I walk down the street,
what do people see?

324
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:04,096
A couple of losers, right?

325
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:07,973
We add her to the equation, you know
what people are gonna think?

326
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:08,982
What?

327
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:13,696
There goes two of the coolest
mother fuckers who ever lived.

328
00:26:15,743 --> 00:26:19,029
You know what?
I don't know about you, man, but...

329
00:26:19,122 --> 00:26:22,289
I'm already
a cool motherfucker, you know?

330
00:26:22,376 --> 00:26:25,081
Sometimes you got
your own tongue up your ass.

331
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:27,959
Little fuckin' pendejo.

332
00:26:29,468 --> 00:26:33,595
I could feel the blood
coursing through my veins.

333
00:26:35,265 --> 00:26:38,469
Merry Christmas.
Did you ever use one of these?

334
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,596
Ever heard of the
Beverly Hills Gun Club?

335
00:26:44,942 --> 00:26:47,860
Shotgun in hand,
kicking down a door and wondering

336
00:26:47,946 --> 00:26:50,104
if there was heavy firepower
on the other side.

337
00:26:50,198 --> 00:26:52,523
Domino, you cover the side.

338
00:26:52,617 --> 00:26:54,989
Choco, you cover the rear.

339
00:26:55,078 --> 00:26:57,450
On my word.

340
00:26:58,373 --> 00:27:00,117
Turns out...

341
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:03,294
my first raid was to be
a near-disaster.

342
00:27:06,383 --> 00:27:08,709
That bitch Louise set us up.

343
00:27:08,802 --> 00:27:10,925
Hector was hiding underneath
her bed all along.

344
00:27:11,012 --> 00:27:14,713
- Hey, what's up, fool?
- Hurry! There's 3 po-pos out front!

345
00:27:14,808 --> 00:27:17,050
Fuck. You serious?

346
00:27:23,443 --> 00:27:25,851
Ed On my go.

347
00:27:28,281 --> 00:27:29,856
Go.

348
00:27:44,921 --> 00:27:49,251
That night, my coin was tossed.

349
00:27:50,177 --> 00:27:52,929
Heads, you live. Tails, you die.

350
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,893
50/50 chance.

351
00:28:01,398 --> 00:28:03,105
Life or death.

352
00:28:12,326 --> 00:28:14,484
This ain't Sunset Boulevard.

353
00:28:16,622 --> 00:28:19,576
My destiny was life.

354
00:28:27,844 --> 00:28:30,514
Life as a bounty hunter.

355
00:28:34,392 --> 00:28:36,634
Put that shit down, homey!

356
00:28:36,728 --> 00:28:40,180
What the fuck you doin', bitch?!
Step back, motherfucker!

357
00:28:49,158 --> 00:28:50,819
What the fuck you want?

358
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:54,076
We're not cops. We're bounty hunters.
All we want is Hector.

359
00:28:54,163 --> 00:28:56,452
Fuck you and the fuckin' po-pos, bitch!

360
00:28:56,541 --> 00:28:58,914
You tell me where he is,
and I'll give you...

361
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:00,201
You'll what?

362
00:29:00,296 --> 00:29:05,004
Sometimes a girl has to be
naughty to get herself out of a jam.

363
00:29:05,092 --> 00:29:07,002
I'll give you a lap dance.

364
00:29:07,095 --> 00:29:08,969
Man, fuck you, bitch!

365
00:29:09,056 --> 00:29:11,804
I'll give you a lap dance,
bra and panties on.

366
00:29:11,888 --> 00:29:15,221
Man, if I wanted all that,
I'd go to a strip joint, motherfucker.

367
00:29:15,308 --> 00:29:17,716
Come on, you and me.

368
00:29:19,063 --> 00:29:20,937
You know you want it.

369
00:29:21,941 --> 00:29:24,265
Hey, what do you think, dawg?

370
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:26,399
I want to see what the fuck
this bitch is workin' with.

371
00:29:26,487 --> 00:29:29,938
- I'm offering it to you, baby. Come on.
- Is that right?

372
00:29:30,741 --> 00:29:33,197
Well, take off your clothes, bitch.

373
00:29:35,997 --> 00:29:38,323
Sit down.

374
00:29:40,419 --> 00:29:42,328
That's right, girl.
That's right, girl.

375
00:30:05,864 --> 00:30:07,656
It worked.

376
00:30:07,866 --> 00:30:10,867
We got the scoop
on how to find Hector.

377
00:30:10,953 --> 00:30:13,029
2 weeks later, we nailed him.

378
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,332
Claremont was Charlie
to our three Angels.

379
00:30:20,421 --> 00:30:24,918
It's very simple. The...
DMV is the de facto conduit

380
00:30:25,009 --> 00:30:26,836
for all humanity,

381
00:30:26,928 --> 00:30:28,838
and every human being
that we track down

382
00:30:28,931 --> 00:30:31,849
has a record in the DMV database.

383
00:30:31,935 --> 00:30:35,469
Whether it be LAPD,
Social Services,

384
00:30:35,563 --> 00:30:37,354
the Credit Bureau, or the FBI,

385
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,932
they all use the DMV's database
as their hub.

386
00:30:40,027 --> 00:30:43,231
So, we have people on the inside
who feed us the information.

387
00:30:43,322 --> 00:30:45,113
This one right there.

388
00:30:45,449 --> 00:30:48,450
Shit. And who would know it?

389
00:30:48,536 --> 00:30:53,739
The gatekeepers of humanity turn out
to be a bunch of sassy black women.

390
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,460
Excuse me?

391
00:31:02,547 --> 00:31:04,753
He said he liked your suit.

392
00:31:06,467 --> 00:31:08,923
- Tell him what you said.
- I like your suit.

393
00:31:20,317 --> 00:31:24,018
After 6 months,
Claremont hired Alf to drive us around.

394
00:31:24,113 --> 00:31:26,650
We were so busy.

395
00:31:29,953 --> 00:31:35,291
Little did I know that the FBI liked
to keep tabs on us bounty hunters.

396
00:31:37,794 --> 00:31:41,413
Ed, what did you do
before you were a bounty hunter?

397
00:31:41,506 --> 00:31:45,006
I played music. I was a musician.

398
00:31:45,094 --> 00:31:46,588
Really?

399
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:48,588
What, in a band?

400
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,551
Did you ever hear
of Stevie Ray Vaughan?

401
00:31:51,644 --> 00:31:53,802
Wait, you're shitting me.

402
00:31:54,689 --> 00:31:57,523
Stevie and I hooked up in Austin.

403
00:31:58,609 --> 00:32:02,192
Back in the day,
we did the bus tour thing together.

404
00:32:02,697 --> 00:32:06,113
Played every goddamn
small club that would have us.

405
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:11,905
Yep. Me and that boy, we tore it up.

406
00:32:14,335 --> 00:32:16,042
Holy shit.

407
00:32:16,127 --> 00:32:19,579
Played with Pat Benatar,
but that was only when I needed cash.

408
00:32:19,674 --> 00:32:22,711
Fuck off. I love Pat Benatar.

409
00:32:22,802 --> 00:32:25,009
Hey... So did I.

410
00:32:26,138 --> 00:32:28,677
But that's another story.

411
00:32:29,849 --> 00:32:32,219
Love is a battlefield, baby.

412
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,647
What about Choco?
How did you meet him?

413
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,032
I met Choco on the street...

414
00:32:46,116 --> 00:32:49,200
a few hours after he got out of lockup.

415
00:32:49,285 --> 00:32:53,154
He was standing there
in a pair of those jailhouse slippers.

416
00:32:54,042 --> 00:32:57,825
He didn't have a nickel in his pocket
or a place to sleep.

417
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,162
We started talking, and I liked the kid.

418
00:33:00,256 --> 00:33:02,664
Like a little brother.

419
00:33:03,635 --> 00:33:05,426
You know?

420
00:33:05,512 --> 00:33:08,298
Worst thing in the world
is to be caged up.

421
00:33:08,389 --> 00:33:12,768
That boy has been there,
and he ain't never goin' back.

422
00:33:12,853 --> 00:33:15,891
Even if it costs him his life.

423
00:33:22,781 --> 00:33:25,948
- What you lookin' at, darlin'?
- Nothing!

424
00:33:26,035 --> 00:33:27,743
Put that fucking gun down!

425
00:33:29,664 --> 00:33:31,538
Put the fucking gun down!

426
00:33:43,053 --> 00:33:46,008
Choco grew up
on the streets of Venezuela.

427
00:33:46,099 --> 00:33:47,261
When he was four years old,

428
00:33:47,349 --> 00:33:50,054
he stabbed another kid in the eyeball
with a pencil.

429
00:33:52,146 --> 00:33:54,852
There were wires crossed
somewhere in his soul.

430
00:34:19,089 --> 00:34:23,383
In 2003,
I was named Bounty Hunter of the Year.

431
00:34:31,685 --> 00:34:35,684
To the woman who has brought
beauty and grace

432
00:34:35,775 --> 00:34:37,768
to this profession...

433
00:34:37,861 --> 00:34:40,565
Domino Harve-e-e-ey!

434
00:35:01,468 --> 00:35:04,968
From that day on, Eddie,
Choco, and I were inseparable.

435
00:35:09,269 --> 00:35:11,641
It turned out
the three sassy black women and Raul

436
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:16,392
were the gatekeepers of humanity...
the DMV.

437
00:35:16,485 --> 00:35:19,155
Lateesha was one of
Claremont's many mistresses.

438
00:35:19,238 --> 00:35:21,812
Claremont was godfather to us all.

439
00:35:22,033 --> 00:35:25,201
Just look at t that luscious action
right there. Look at that.

440
00:35:25,288 --> 00:35:28,159
Man, I'm gonna get you
a pair of glasses.

441
00:35:32,753 --> 00:35:34,462
Hey.

442
00:35:34,547 --> 00:35:36,623
That's an ass.

443
00:36:10,791 --> 00:36:14,161
Weather's gonna be
a great day today. Lots of sunshine.

444
00:36:14,254 --> 00:36:16,876
Cool temperatures, though.
We should be at 76 degrees.

445
00:36:16,965 --> 00:36:20,832
You know, a guy could get used
to a life this ordinary.

446
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,351
Maybe you should...

447
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,900
Maybe you should fuck her mom, too.

448
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:39,236
What the fuck is your problem, bitch?

449
00:36:39,991 --> 00:36:41,532
So, who is this Choico?

450
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:43,660
Mum was terrified for me.

451
00:36:43,744 --> 00:36:45,654
She didn't approve
of my lifestyle one bit.

452
00:36:45,746 --> 00:36:47,871
Is he your new boyfriend?

453
00:36:51,127 --> 00:36:54,378
His name is Choco, and he's not
my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.

454
00:36:54,465 --> 00:36:57,501
Whatever. He's a criminal.
And that Ed Moseby character...

455
00:36:57,593 --> 00:37:00,049
I mean, he's a complete loser.

456
00:37:02,806 --> 00:37:05,974
He knew Frank Sinatra.

457
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,348
Who didn't?

458
00:37:16,405 --> 00:37:20,948
We may have been
dysfunctional, but we worked.

459
00:37:21,035 --> 00:37:22,779
We were family.

460
00:37:29,212 --> 00:37:30,785
Do you know this man?

461
00:37:30,876 --> 00:37:33,960
Yeah, he's a reality television producer.

462
00:37:34,045 --> 00:37:36,715
His name's Mark Heiss.

463
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:42,503
Mr Heiss was very generous in turning
over some videotapes to the FBI.

464
00:37:42,597 --> 00:37:45,170
There's lots of footage of you.

465
00:37:46,226 --> 00:37:48,895
We know everything.

466
00:37:49,354 --> 00:37:50,552
Mark Heiss
was friends with Mum.

467
00:37:50,647 --> 00:37:52,935
I hate this!

468
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,304
They changed the fucking font!

469
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,975
He heard my story
at some cocktail party.

470
00:37:57,071 --> 00:38:00,025
She's stupid! You're not stupid.

471
00:38:00,116 --> 00:38:01,908
- All right.
- Get Cynthia on the line!

472
00:38:01,993 --> 00:38:05,197
- Well, Domino's in the lobby.
- They changed the fucking font!

473
00:38:05,289 --> 00:38:07,447
Well, Domino's been waiting.

474
00:38:07,541 --> 00:38:09,166
Put her in the conference room.

475
00:38:09,251 --> 00:38:11,209
Turns out, he wanted
to put us on television.

476
00:38:12,714 --> 00:38:16,047
I should let you know that
Mr Heiss will only be available to meet

477
00:38:16,134 --> 00:38:19,420
for about five minutes, so we should
hurry up and cut to the point.

478
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:25,558
And speak in short sentences
because he has the attention span

479
00:38:25,644 --> 00:38:27,352
of a ferret on crystal meth.

480
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:30,898
Mum was horrified
and demanded to tag along

481
00:38:30,984 --> 00:38:33,474
just to keep me from signing anything.

482
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:37,398
- I've seen that.
- Excuse me?

483
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:39,198
A ferret on crystal meth.

484
00:38:46,585 --> 00:38:48,993
You don't speak...
you don't speak Spanish?

485
00:38:49,087 --> 00:38:51,045
- No.
- No?

486
00:38:52,299 --> 00:38:55,917
This is LA, man.
You should speak Spanish, you know?

487
00:38:58,472 --> 00:39:01,010
OK, everybody has water...

488
00:39:06,689 --> 00:39:11,015
God, he should be here
any second. Here he is.

489
00:39:12,192 --> 00:39:14,943
- Sophie.
- Hello.

490
00:39:15,528 --> 00:39:19,313
Sorry, guys, about the wait.
I'm having font issues.

491
00:39:19,408 --> 00:39:22,445
Let me cut to the chase
'cause I have to take this call.

492
00:39:22,536 --> 00:39:25,657
We want to follow you around
with a camera crew for a week.

493
00:39:25,748 --> 00:39:29,497
The last thing we did...
the pilot episode... is not testing well.

494
00:39:29,586 --> 00:39:31,495
We got too many rednecks.

495
00:39:37,803 --> 00:39:39,843
It's too much like Cops.

496
00:39:39,931 --> 00:39:41,591
We need... Go ahead.

497
00:39:42,434 --> 00:39:44,010
We need...

498
00:39:44,393 --> 00:39:46,682
something sexy!

499
00:39:47,313 --> 00:39:49,472
Something different.

500
00:39:51,484 --> 00:39:53,478
We need Domino.

501
00:39:56,991 --> 00:39:58,818
We need Domino.

502
00:40:01,245 --> 00:40:03,368
Listen, friend...

503
00:40:04,373 --> 00:40:06,367
we ain't gonna do this thing

504
00:40:06,459 --> 00:40:09,415
unless the whole team
gets equal coverage.

505
00:40:09,923 --> 00:40:13,292
You're not her father, Ed.
No one cares what you think.

506
00:40:18,807 --> 00:40:21,642
Well, with all due respect, Mom,

507
00:40:21,726 --> 00:40:26,354
I'm her boss,
and she's on my team. OK?

508
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:31,518
And unless we all get equal coverage,

509
00:40:31,612 --> 00:40:34,815
we're all gonna walk the fuck
out of here together?

510
00:40:40,163 --> 00:40:43,699
Equal coverage, or we all walk.

511
00:40:43,793 --> 00:40:45,701
Done! OK.

512
00:40:46,421 --> 00:40:48,746
The whole team... We follow it.

513
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:52,704
What guarantee can you give us that
Domino's name won't be tarnished?

514
00:40:52,799 --> 00:40:55,716
Sophie, this is reality television.

515
00:40:55,801 --> 00:40:59,421
What you see is what you get.

516
00:40:59,515 --> 00:41:03,928
You will be exploited,
your story won't be told truthfully,

517
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,475
and your life will never be the same.

518
00:41:06,563 --> 00:41:09,233
I beg you.

519
00:41:09,316 --> 00:41:12,520
I beg you not to get involved with this...

520
00:41:12,612 --> 00:41:14,604
this drivel!

521
00:41:15,782 --> 00:41:18,451
No offence, Mark,
but we both know that this is drivel.

522
00:41:18,535 --> 00:41:20,694
No offence taken.

523
00:41:20,787 --> 00:41:23,575
Anyway, if she's gonna be in anything,
she should be in the centre.

524
00:41:23,666 --> 00:41:25,907
Sure, OK.

525
00:41:26,001 --> 00:41:28,208
But...

526
00:41:28,296 --> 00:41:30,372
Done!

527
00:41:30,465 --> 00:41:33,253
Talk it over. I have to take this call.

528
00:41:33,344 --> 00:41:36,962
Cynthia, you changed the fucking font
on the promo! Why?

529
00:41:37,056 --> 00:41:41,006
I felt like a hypocrite,
given my hatred of all things Hollywood,

530
00:41:41,102 --> 00:41:43,427
but I'll admit...

531
00:41:43,521 --> 00:41:45,477
I wanted my story told.

532
00:41:46,315 --> 00:41:49,234
I wanted everyone to know
the things I'd done.

533
00:41:49,319 --> 00:41:51,941
I wanted some recognition
in the world.

534
00:41:54,408 --> 00:41:55,902
We'll do it.

535
00:41:58,078 --> 00:42:00,237
We'll do it.

536
00:42:01,415 --> 00:42:04,582
God help us. God help us all.

537
00:42:04,669 --> 00:42:07,705
It was the beginning of the end.

538
00:42:09,383 --> 00:42:11,672
Jerry! Jerry!

539
00:42:11,761 --> 00:42:16,304
Welcome back. We're here in LA
with mixed race single mothers.

540
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:18,798
Our next guest
takes pride in the fact

541
00:42:18,893 --> 00:42:21,135
that she's in the Guinness
Book of World Records

542
00:42:21,229 --> 00:42:25,062
for being America's
youngest grandmother.

543
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:28,602
And... she's only 28.

544
00:42:28,695 --> 00:42:30,898
Please welcome Lateesha Rodriguez!

545
00:42:30,986 --> 00:42:33,857
Lateesha was
our prime contact at the DMV.

546
00:42:33,947 --> 00:42:37,529
Most of our bond certificates
came from Claremont through her.

547
00:42:41,164 --> 00:42:43,121
- Hey, Jerry!
- Hey, Lateesha. How are you?

548
00:42:43,208 --> 00:42:44,916
- I'm fine.
- What's going on?

549
00:42:45,001 --> 00:42:48,334
I'm here today to speak
for all people of mixed race in America.

550
00:42:48,421 --> 00:42:52,254
Now, as a blactino woman, I believe
we deserve our own race category

551
00:42:52,343 --> 00:42:55,130
to forge an identity, Jerry.
That's how I feel.

552
00:42:55,221 --> 00:42:57,510
Did you just say "blactino"?

553
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,638
Yes, I did. I'm a blactino-American.

554
00:42:59,726 --> 00:43:01,553
First of all...

555
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:03,685
first of all, you don't even look Latino.

556
00:43:03,772 --> 00:43:05,931
You look black.
You're... You're black.

557
00:43:06,025 --> 00:43:09,061
Second of all, I'm of mixed race,
and I've struggled my whole life

558
00:43:09,152 --> 00:43:11,441
as to whether I'm Chinese
or whether I'm black.

559
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:13,939
Chinegro! What you are is chinegro!

560
00:43:14,034 --> 00:43:16,276
- Chinegro?
- Chinegro! There you go!

561
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:18,445
- Chinegro?
- You are a chinegro!

562
00:43:18,538 --> 00:43:23,034
- What the is chinegro?
- That's what you are! Chinegro is you!

563
00:43:23,126 --> 00:43:25,452
That's some bulls...

564
00:43:25,546 --> 00:43:29,044
OK, as I understand it, you brought
a mixed-race flow chart with you.

565
00:43:29,132 --> 00:43:32,052
Why don't we bring that out?

566
00:43:33,514 --> 00:43:37,381
How you doin', sugar? All right.
I'm gonna call you later.

567
00:43:37,476 --> 00:43:39,931
All right.

568
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:42,724
Take a look at this...

569
00:43:42,815 --> 00:43:46,517
Blactino, black Asian, hispasian, OK?

570
00:43:46,612 --> 00:43:49,695
Now, for the Asian subcategories,
I got you, sister.

571
00:43:49,781 --> 00:43:52,818
We have chinegro right here.
That's you. Chinegro.

572
00:43:52,909 --> 00:43:55,033
That's not a word! That's not a word!

573
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:59,367
Yes, it is, sister.
We have koreagro. Japegro, OK?

574
00:44:01,334 --> 00:44:04,621
Chispanic, koreaspanic,
and last but not least,

575
00:44:04,714 --> 00:44:07,833
check this out, y'all... japanic.

576
00:44:07,967 --> 00:44:10,122
That's how I flow with it!

577
00:44:10,215 --> 00:44:14,131
Do you believe the government should
recognise these racial subgroups?

578
00:44:14,221 --> 00:44:15,680
Yes, Jerry, I do.

579
00:44:15,764 --> 00:44:17,009
Hey, wait!

580
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:19,887
First of all, first of all,
honey, let me tell you,

581
00:44:19,977 --> 00:44:22,765
from one, blactino woman
to another...

582
00:44:22,856 --> 00:44:25,228
- Right on.
- Our concern is education!

583
00:44:25,317 --> 00:44:28,650
You ever hear of that?! Here you are,
a 28-year-old grandmother!

584
00:44:28,736 --> 00:44:30,563
Yes, I am.

585
00:44:30,655 --> 00:44:32,731
You need to add another category
to your flow chart.

586
00:44:32,824 --> 00:44:36,407
It's called birth control, bitch!

587
00:44:40,165 --> 00:44:42,573
OK, yeah. Check this out.

588
00:44:42,668 --> 00:44:44,875
I am educated, you blactino bitch!

589
00:44:44,963 --> 00:44:46,161
What?!

590
00:44:46,256 --> 00:44:49,422
I'm a Devry graduate! And, yes,
my daughter might be a single mother...

591
00:44:49,508 --> 00:44:53,508
- I'll kick your ass! I'll kick your ass!
- Bring it, bitch!

592
00:44:53,598 --> 00:44:57,893
Jerry! Jerry!
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

593
00:45:13,411 --> 00:45:16,911
- Come on, Bri. We're late, we're late.
- Dude, it's fucking Map quest.

594
00:45:16,998 --> 00:45:18,990
I told you, never again
with that piece of shit.

595
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:20,577
Guys.

596
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:23,664
Come meet Domino.

597
00:45:23,755 --> 00:45:27,706
Domino, I want you to meet
the co-hosts of Bounty Squad.

598
00:45:28,845 --> 00:45:31,845
Fucking... fucking... fucking...

599
00:45:31,931 --> 00:45:35,930
fucking 90210.
I couldn't get away from it.

600
00:45:36,019 --> 00:45:38,012
It wasn't until later on that I realised

601
00:45:38,105 --> 00:45:41,141
Mum had gotten to Heiss
and pulled some strings.

602
00:45:41,233 --> 00:45:43,060
Ian Ziering.

603
00:45:44,279 --> 00:45:47,482
Brian Austin Green. Domino.

604
00:45:49,575 --> 00:45:51,196
Cocoa... Choco.

605
00:45:51,282 --> 00:45:53,440
- Cocoa?
- Choco.

606
00:45:53,534 --> 00:45:55,326
Choco. Sorry.

607
00:45:55,411 --> 00:45:57,203
The man from Afghanistan

608
00:45:57,288 --> 00:46:01,073
has made some significant
changes to the RV.

609
00:46:02,711 --> 00:46:04,538
My God.

610
00:46:18,897 --> 00:46:21,731
Are those real bones?

611
00:46:21,816 --> 00:46:24,354
Monkey... monkey bones?

612
00:46:25,069 --> 00:46:27,442
Shrunken heads?

613
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:29,607
From my family.

614
00:46:29,908 --> 00:46:32,908
I drive these bounty hunters
for a free Afghanistan.

615
00:46:32,994 --> 00:46:36,909
I didn't know
this was gonna be a political show.

616
00:46:39,085 --> 00:46:44,209
Alf grew up during the Russian
invasion of Afghanistan.

617
00:46:49,012 --> 00:46:52,428
He had always wanted to be
part of the revolution

618
00:46:53,767 --> 00:46:56,389
but it seemed to pass him by.

619
00:46:59,232 --> 00:47:01,189
At the tender age of 14,

620
00:47:01,275 --> 00:47:04,395
he decided that explosives
would be his speciality.

621
00:47:25,219 --> 00:47:27,675
His eyebrows
never grew back.

622
00:47:30,262 --> 00:47:32,752
OK, Ed...

623
00:47:32,847 --> 00:47:35,469
What background should someone have
if they want to go into bounty hunting?

624
00:47:35,559 --> 00:47:37,932
How does jail sound?

625
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:43,558
So, tell me, do you boys hunt?

626
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,977
I killed a... I killed a squirrel...

627
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:49,609
once.

628
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:59,033
Well, let me tell you something.
Once you hunt a human being,

629
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:02,708
you'll never hunt an animal again.

630
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:04,790
You know, it's a different kind of rush.

631
00:48:04,883 --> 00:48:08,798
The problem is, is that when
you've done it for as long as I have,

632
00:48:08,887 --> 00:48:10,797
all you got to show for it is

633
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:14,591
an empty bank account and, IBS.

634
00:48:17,105 --> 00:48:20,273
- IBS?
- Yeah, that's irritable bowel syndrome.

635
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:25,151
You got a spastic colon?
That's hysterical.

636
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:27,398
You know, my grandmother
has one of those.

637
00:48:27,491 --> 00:48:29,568
Does your grandmother hunt?

638
00:48:30,537 --> 00:48:33,206
Well, I don't know. Maybe.

639
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,786
Why don't you just
shut the fuck up?

640
00:48:46,178 --> 00:48:49,097
You were supposed to talk about
the healthcare crisis!

641
00:48:49,182 --> 00:48:51,887
Exactly. Why would you use
Jerry Springer

642
00:48:51,977 --> 00:48:56,224
as a platform for some kind of
progressive race modification proposal?

643
00:48:56,314 --> 00:48:59,269
Well, I don't think Ted Koppel
would blook Lateesha Rodriguez!

644
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:03,192
- Not a chance.
- Not a chance in hell.

645
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,773
OK, Jerry is one of the only forums
our people have, baby.

646
00:49:05,868 --> 00:49:08,785
I thought having time on Springer
would give me a chance

647
00:49:08,871 --> 00:49:12,616
of gettin' a blook deal
or a correspondence gig on BET.

648
00:49:12,705 --> 00:49:14,198
Jenny Jones bitch got cancelled.

649
00:49:14,289 --> 00:49:16,614
Yeah, Montel would've been better.

650
00:49:22,591 --> 00:49:25,840
Lateesha's granddaughter
Mika had a rare blood disease.

651
00:49:25,927 --> 00:49:28,845
Her white cell count was dropping fast.

652
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:30,555
Dad?

653
00:49:31,767 --> 00:49:34,008
We need money.

654
00:49:37,313 --> 00:49:38,975
I got an idea.

655
00:49:39,066 --> 00:49:40,561
What?

656
00:49:40,651 --> 00:49:42,444
Armoured car business.

657
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,771
We just signed a new
insurance policy in Nevada.

658
00:49:45,866 --> 00:49:47,823
There's a loophole.

659
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:54,371
Claremont Williams,
bail bondsman,

660
00:49:54,457 --> 00:49:58,670
armoured car service,
bounty hunter service.

661
00:49:58,755 --> 00:50:01,127
An unusual combination.

662
00:50:05,637 --> 00:50:07,629
Kee Kee, me and Claremont

663
00:50:07,722 --> 00:50:11,056
are working on a plan
to get money for Mika.

664
00:50:12,562 --> 00:50:15,812
A real good plan, baby... a good plan.

665
00:50:19,027 --> 00:50:21,269
Are you aware that Lateesha Rodriguez
has been running

666
00:50:21,363 --> 00:50:23,273
a counterfeit driver's licence racket?

667
00:50:23,366 --> 00:50:25,773
Well, that's the word on the street.

668
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:30,905
You drove Lateesha's daughter
to school,

669
00:50:30,999 --> 00:50:34,119
then dropped her off
at the DMV. Why?

670
00:50:34,211 --> 00:50:36,499
Her car was in the shop.

671
00:50:40,384 --> 00:50:45,295
How convenient. The morning
you call in sick, I turn on the TV

672
00:50:45,389 --> 00:50:49,055
and see you all over Jerry Springer.

673
00:50:51,267 --> 00:50:53,805
- Never heard of Ti Vo?
- Think I can afford it?

674
00:50:53,895 --> 00:50:56,266
Give me a break, Pat.
What do you want?

675
00:50:56,355 --> 00:50:59,938
I got a call yesterday from
our health care provider.

676
00:51:00,026 --> 00:51:02,600
They said you tried to pass your
granddaughter off as Kee Kee

677
00:51:02,696 --> 00:51:05,448
down at City Terrace
Community Hospital.

678
00:51:05,533 --> 00:51:09,448
They said you forged the age on the
application for some sort of operation.

679
00:51:09,537 --> 00:51:13,120
Mother fuckin' HMOs
don't cover grandchildren.

680
00:51:13,208 --> 00:51:17,668
That fuckin' operation is 300,000 dollars.
Where am I gonna get the money, Pat?

681
00:51:17,754 --> 00:51:22,666
You should've thought about that
before you became a grandmother.

682
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,884
Fuck you.

683
00:51:25,888 --> 00:51:29,388
You got 2 weeks to clear out your desk.

684
00:51:29,475 --> 00:51:32,430
It just kept
getting worse for Lateesha.

685
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:35,890
- What?
- Did I stutter? 2 weeks.

686
00:51:36,525 --> 00:51:39,360
No one could've
expected what happened next.

687
00:51:39,445 --> 00:51:44,689
By the way, there are a couple of
FBI agents here that want to talk to you.

688
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:53,541
You're gonna go to jail
for a long, long time, Lateesha.

689
00:51:54,129 --> 00:51:56,085
Unless you cooperate with us.

690
00:51:56,172 --> 00:51:59,126
Their names
were Cosgrove and Wilson.

691
00:51:59,217 --> 00:52:02,088
Someone had tipped them off
to Lateesha's counterfeit scam,

692
00:52:02,178 --> 00:52:04,752
but that's not what
they were really after.

693
00:52:04,848 --> 00:52:06,555
I'm listening.

694
00:52:06,641 --> 00:52:09,050
In about 10 minutes,
a college kid named Frances

695
00:52:09,144 --> 00:52:12,893
is gonna walk up to your window
and ask for 4 counterfeit IDs.

696
00:52:14,359 --> 00:52:15,936
You could help us out here.

697
00:52:16,026 --> 00:52:18,517
Lateesha, we want
to know what he's up to.

698
00:52:18,612 --> 00:52:22,824
I mean, look at you. You got your hair
did, your nails lookin' all good.

699
00:52:22,909 --> 00:52:25,948
You go to jail, that's all gonna go away.

700
00:52:26,039 --> 00:52:28,327
- Won't see your kids for a long time.
- Think about it.

701
00:52:28,416 --> 00:52:30,571
It's gonna be long as hell.

702
00:52:32,375 --> 00:52:35,293
This was when Lateesha
decided to do something foolish,

703
00:52:35,378 --> 00:52:38,711
and Frances was
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

704
00:52:38,798 --> 00:52:40,256
OK.

705
00:52:41,843 --> 00:52:46,885
OK. He and three of his friends
are gonna hijack an armoured truck.

706
00:52:49,434 --> 00:52:52,970
They're gonna walk away
with 10 million in cash.

707
00:52:53,063 --> 00:52:55,056
10 million.

708
00:52:56,983 --> 00:53:01,980
Now serving GO86.

709
00:53:05,244 --> 00:53:06,524
Hey.

710
00:53:25,266 --> 00:53:28,350
Weather Sunshine, that's for sure.
We should be at 76 degrees,

711
00:53:28,435 --> 00:53:31,639
the downtown area barely breaking
that 70-degree mark.

712
00:53:31,731 --> 00:53:35,350
66 was the high yesterday. Overnight
lows dropping down to 48 degrees.

713
00:53:35,444 --> 00:53:37,769
All right, y'all, Lateesha done...

714
00:53:37,862 --> 00:53:41,030
Lateesha done dug herself a deep hole,

715
00:53:41,116 --> 00:53:44,616
and, she can't get out by herself.

716
00:53:44,703 --> 00:53:46,613
Can y'all dig what l'm saying?

717
00:53:46,706 --> 00:53:49,957
Mija, we're in a hole together.
We dig together. We're a team.

718
00:53:50,044 --> 00:53:52,998
Just like Billy Ocean says:
"When the going gets tough..."

719
00:53:53,089 --> 00:53:55,414
"the tough get going."

720
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:01,508
There are 3 kinds
of people in this world...

721
00:54:01,597 --> 00:54:03,507
the rich,

722
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:06,555
the poor, and everyone in between.

723
00:54:06,646 --> 00:54:09,314
Think you're having a tough day?
You should see this.

724
00:54:09,398 --> 00:54:11,552
I got an armoured truck that's empty.
Yeah.

725
00:54:11,646 --> 00:54:14,316
I think Mr Wonderful is pulling up now.

726
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:24,780
That's Drake Bishop, owner
of the Stratosphere Hotel and Casino.

727
00:54:24,869 --> 00:54:28,997
He's worth a billion dollars,
10 million of it recently stolen.

728
00:54:29,081 --> 00:54:31,574
His attorney, Burke Beckett.

729
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:34,504
- I'm Detective Chris Cudlitz.
- We know who you are.

730
00:54:34,588 --> 00:54:35,620
Where's my money?

731
00:54:35,715 --> 00:54:38,715
I think it's probably best
if we take a look at the tapes.

732
00:54:43,682 --> 00:54:46,090
Our tapes show
that at 6:23 am,

733
00:54:46,185 --> 00:54:50,597
your truck pulls into the parking lot
and turns the engine off.

734
00:54:52,941 --> 00:54:55,729
- Rewind, please.
- Rewind the tape.

735
00:54:59,031 --> 00:55:02,116
- Freeze the tape.
- Freeze the tape.

736
00:55:02,952 --> 00:55:05,788
- Now, can you zoom in?
- Zoom in, please.

737
00:55:05,872 --> 00:55:08,328
You a fucking mockingbird?
Shut the fuck up!

738
00:55:08,417 --> 00:55:10,076
I just...

739
00:55:15,884 --> 00:55:19,253
- Nancy Reagan.
- I think that's Hillary Clinton.

740
00:55:19,346 --> 00:55:23,130
- Fat ankles.
- It's Barbara fucking Bush.

741
00:55:23,225 --> 00:55:26,060
And Jacqueline Onassis
just to her left.

742
00:55:26,145 --> 00:55:29,596
Christ almighty, it's the goddamned
First Ladies.

743
00:55:30,441 --> 00:55:32,933
If you don't mind me
asking you, Mr Bishop,

744
00:55:33,028 --> 00:55:35,104
what exactly is in those tan duffel bags?

745
00:55:35,197 --> 00:55:39,195
- You don't have to answer that.
- Shut up, Burke. 10 million dollars, cash.

746
00:55:39,285 --> 00:55:42,154
Don't tell me it was a fucking hijacking.

747
00:55:43,955 --> 00:55:46,662
How'd you get me
in this position, Burke?

748
00:55:46,751 --> 00:55:49,751
Mr. Bishop?
You have an urgent telephone call, sir.

749
00:55:50,876 --> 00:55:52,704
Yeah. Bishop.

750
00:55:53,004 --> 00:55:55,330
Bishop, this is Claremont Williams.

751
00:55:55,424 --> 00:55:58,875
I own the Williams Brothers
Armoured Car Service.

752
00:55:58,969 --> 00:56:00,131
Yeah.

753
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:02,793
Hold on a minute, please.

754
00:56:13,985 --> 00:56:15,266
Let me isolate it.

755
00:56:16,029 --> 00:56:19,861
Yesterday I received
an e-mail from a source.

756
00:56:19,951 --> 00:56:22,655
In this e-mail were
four social security numbers

757
00:56:22,745 --> 00:56:25,414
made to counterfeit
California driver's licences.

758
00:56:25,498 --> 00:56:26,743
And?

759
00:56:26,833 --> 00:56:29,454
I believe these are the gentlemen
who robbed us, sir.

760
00:56:29,544 --> 00:56:32,711
I'm also a bail bondsman
out of Los Angeles,

761
00:56:32,798 --> 00:56:36,879
and I can track down and deliver these
thieves to you for a small finder's fee.

762
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:40,339
- How much?
- Just 300,000 dollars.

763
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:43,307
And what happens
if you don't deliver?

764
00:56:43,393 --> 00:56:47,557
My theft insurance policy
will have to fork over that 10 million dollars.

765
00:56:47,648 --> 00:56:49,557
That will take 6-8 months.

766
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:52,270
But you should know, sir,
that I employ bounty hunters,

767
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:55,695
and my bounty hunters can and will
track down these thieves.

768
00:56:55,782 --> 00:56:59,732
Well, you deliver these crooks to me
and you've got yourself a deal...

769
00:56:59,828 --> 00:57:01,072
300,000.

770
00:57:01,162 --> 00:57:03,534
Thank you, sir. That's a deal.

771
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,914
Crime boss Anthony Cigliutti.

772
00:57:11,465 --> 00:57:15,546
Bishop's attorney had put his boss
in business with the mob.

773
00:57:15,637 --> 00:57:17,345
They're asking for a findera's fee.

774
00:57:17,431 --> 00:57:20,349
Finder's fee? That's bullshit.

775
00:57:20,434 --> 00:57:22,722
Sounds like an inside job to me.

776
00:57:22,811 --> 00:57:25,384
Could be. Who knows
if this Claremont Williams

777
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,273
is in on the heist or not.

778
00:57:27,358 --> 00:57:30,854
All I know, if this joker
delivers the First Ladies,

779
00:57:30,942 --> 00:57:33,812
we'll split the 300,000 fee with you.

780
00:57:36,405 --> 00:57:40,190
All right, gentlemen.
Sounds like we got a little situation here.

781
00:57:41,202 --> 00:57:44,120
Quite a mess indeed.

782
00:57:44,206 --> 00:57:48,667
Beckett had just brokered
an underhanded deal with Cigliutti.

783
00:57:48,752 --> 00:57:51,623
The 10 million,
en route from LA to Vegas,

784
00:57:51,713 --> 00:57:53,207
belonged to the mob.

785
00:57:53,298 --> 00:57:57,843
Bishop's clean reputation was a great
cover for laundered cash.

786
00:57:58,805 --> 00:58:01,724
If the FBI could link
the two men together,

787
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:04,134
it would be the takedown of the century.

788
00:58:08,441 --> 00:58:11,941
The FBI was always listening,
hence the underwater cordless.

789
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:21,742
In Needles.

790
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:31,796
Locus Fender was brought in
to drive the armoured car,

791
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:34,255
another one of Claremont's
network of stooges.

792
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,919
His mother Edna
worked at the Nedles DMV.

793
00:58:37,015 --> 00:58:41,060
Mama! You're not gonna believe this.
Mama, come quick!

794
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:44,225
- Where are the First Ladies?
- They disappeared.

795
00:58:44,313 --> 00:58:45,974
What do you mean, they disappeared?

796
00:58:46,065 --> 00:58:50,110
According to Locus,
they stopped for gas.

797
00:58:51,739 --> 00:58:55,072
I'm gonna fill up the tank and grab
a Mountain Dew. Don't make a peep.

798
00:58:55,159 --> 00:58:57,365
Especially you, Barbara.

799
00:59:04,168 --> 00:59:06,125
- Hey, man.
- Hey, how's it going?

800
00:59:06,212 --> 00:59:08,336
I need to get...

801
00:59:08,424 --> 00:59:11,089
8 dollars of gas and...

802
00:59:11,173 --> 00:59:13,959
A Mountain Dew.
Do you have Moonpie?

803
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,541
Yeah, I got a couple of them over there.

804
00:59:17,346 --> 00:59:19,719
And a slim...

805
00:59:19,807 --> 00:59:22,725
Shit! No, no, no!

806
00:59:22,811 --> 00:59:26,678
He was sure they'd nabbed
the cash. Straight-up double-cross.

807
00:59:31,862 --> 00:59:34,400
But they'd left without it.

808
00:59:34,781 --> 00:59:37,699
That doesn't make any sense.

809
00:59:41,290 --> 00:59:44,124
Well, they left all the money.
It doesn't make sense...

810
00:59:44,209 --> 00:59:47,708
Locus! Fuck 'em. Their loss is our gain.

811
00:59:47,796 --> 00:59:49,587
Put the money in the freezer.

812
00:59:49,673 --> 00:59:53,007
- Mama?
- Locus... Fuck 'em.

813
00:59:53,636 --> 00:59:54,880
OK, Mama.

814
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:59,184
Either this was some kind of
setup, or the First Ladies got scared,

815
00:59:59,268 --> 01:00:01,177
decided to pull out and cut their losses.

816
01:00:04,898 --> 01:00:07,650
Are you wearing makeup?

817
01:00:07,735 --> 01:00:09,811
What, can you tell?

818
01:00:09,904 --> 01:00:13,107
You're wearing eyeliner, man.
You look like a drag queen.

819
01:00:13,908 --> 01:00:15,735
Who the hell is that?

820
01:00:30,509 --> 01:00:33,714
Guys, it's time.
We need the bounty hunters.

821
01:00:33,806 --> 01:00:36,474
Come on! 110%.

822
01:00:36,558 --> 01:00:40,058
Looks like Night of the Living Dead.

823
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:44,314
Are we on? Now?

824
01:00:44,401 --> 01:00:45,349
Yeah, now.

825
01:00:45,443 --> 01:00:48,979
- Is that a joint?
- No. He's not smoking.

826
01:00:49,073 --> 01:00:52,770
Put that down. You know, television...
the people watching, those kids...

827
01:00:52,864 --> 01:00:53,979
Yeah, yeah...

828
01:01:00,163 --> 01:01:04,244
Claremont fed us a fake story
about the First Ladies.

829
01:01:06,045 --> 01:01:08,168
Are we rolling?

830
01:01:08,256 --> 01:01:11,874
So, today, Domino and her team are out
to nab four criminals for forging checks

831
01:01:11,968 --> 01:01:14,175
with counterfeit driver's licences.

832
01:01:14,262 --> 01:01:17,216
What can you tell us about
these 4 creeps, Domino?

833
01:01:17,306 --> 01:01:21,556
Apparently, they call
themselves the First Ladies.

834
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:25,965
Jackie Onassis...
his real name was Lester Kincaid.

835
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:28,346
Yo, yo, yo yo, yo

836
01:01:32,481 --> 01:01:36,312
Hey, Rochelle.
Put your mama on the phone.

837
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:38,025
Hey, what's happening, baby?

838
01:01:38,446 --> 01:01:40,237
Lester Kincaid, you're going to jail.

839
01:01:40,323 --> 01:01:42,779
What the fuck is this shit? Hey, man!

840
01:01:43,993 --> 01:01:46,365
I need clearances.

841
01:01:52,627 --> 01:01:54,620
- Go, go.
- Cho... Chocko... Choco.

842
01:01:54,713 --> 01:01:56,789
Jesus. This guy's a psychopath.

843
01:01:56,882 --> 01:02:01,343
What do we get for 10 dollars?
Everything you want.

844
01:02:01,429 --> 01:02:05,807
Nancy Reagan turned out to
be a sex addict named Howie Stein.

845
01:02:05,893 --> 01:02:10,305
My name is Howie, and I am
a recovering nymphomaniac.

846
01:02:10,397 --> 01:02:12,854
Yeah!
Hi, Howie.

847
01:02:22,953 --> 01:02:25,989
Now, if 2 Live Crew
has taught us anything,

848
01:02:26,081 --> 01:02:30,158
it's that horniness in today's society
is out of control.

849
01:02:30,248 --> 01:02:32,656
And at one point
within the next decade,

850
01:02:32,751 --> 01:02:34,459
mark my words, ladies and gentlemen,

851
01:02:34,545 --> 01:02:37,830
society will have reached
something I call...

852
01:02:37,923 --> 01:02:39,999
APATT...

853
01:02:41,301 --> 01:02:44,469
"All porno, all the time."

854
01:02:44,556 --> 01:02:49,183
Pornography will have become
an epidemic in this country.

855
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:52,306
Phase one... masturbation.

856
01:02:52,398 --> 01:02:55,399
- Who's this chump?
- That's Howard Stein.

857
01:02:55,485 --> 01:02:57,856
He's an entertainment lawyer,
some shit firm.

858
01:02:57,945 --> 01:02:59,226
Love him.

859
01:02:59,321 --> 01:03:01,279
He's so attractive.

860
01:03:01,365 --> 01:03:03,443
And to our female friends here today,

861
01:03:03,536 --> 01:03:08,612
we must not abuse of our dogs with
the lure of a peanut butter snatch.

862
01:03:08,707 --> 01:03:11,993
We must channel our horniness
into extracurricular activities.

863
01:03:12,086 --> 01:03:14,873
Howard Stein, you're under arrest.

864
01:03:14,964 --> 01:03:18,713
Whoa! Look, he's got him by the eyes.

865
01:03:26,311 --> 01:03:31,103
Barbara Bush
and Hillary Clinton were next.

866
01:03:37,673 --> 01:03:40,164
Frances and Charles Cigliutti.

867
01:03:40,259 --> 01:03:44,091
Their father was mob boss
Anthony Cigliutti. They were Mafia kids.

868
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:47,430
We found them at their frat house, and
they'd been under FBI surveillance

869
01:03:47,517 --> 01:03:49,805
for the past six months.

870
01:04:02,074 --> 01:04:04,399
All right, boys, we're in business.

871
01:04:04,493 --> 01:04:07,449
Yeah. The bounty hunters have arrived.

872
01:04:08,957 --> 01:04:12,074
They're driving Winne...
driving Winnebagos?

873
01:04:16,045 --> 01:04:18,617
What is this shit?

874
01:04:20,507 --> 01:04:23,045
Is that the guy from
Beverly Hills 90210?

875
01:04:23,135 --> 01:04:26,636
- I fuckin' loved that show, man.
- Well, he hasn't aged well.

876
01:04:33,605 --> 01:04:36,891
We're looking for Frances and Charles!
Are they here?

877
01:04:40,737 --> 01:04:44,321
We're from a new reality TV show.
It's called Bounty Squad.

878
01:04:45,869 --> 01:04:49,285
Jesus, look at that.
She just tells it like it is.

879
01:04:49,373 --> 01:04:52,290
It's... It's... we should sign her.

880
01:05:04,097 --> 01:05:05,924
Frances! Frances!

881
01:05:06,016 --> 01:05:10,176
Frances! Frances!

882
01:05:10,270 --> 01:05:13,889
All right, 60 seconds.
Here's the question.

883
01:05:14,525 --> 01:05:16,815
Which one of you is Frances?

884
01:05:57,485 --> 01:05:58,683
This girl is gonna be a star.

885
01:05:58,778 --> 01:06:02,313
We should sign her
to a talent holding deal.

886
01:06:02,990 --> 01:06:04,699
Stay down!

887
01:06:04,784 --> 01:06:06,861
Fucker!

888
01:06:29,146 --> 01:06:31,221
Fuck!

889
01:06:49,042 --> 01:06:50,999
Fuck.

890
01:06:51,086 --> 01:06:54,087
I told him back off.
It's too psychotic.

891
01:07:09,982 --> 01:07:11,724
- Hello?
- You get all four?

892
01:07:11,816 --> 01:07:14,024
- Yeah.
- Good.

893
01:07:14,111 --> 01:07:16,437
Deliver them to the Needles DMV,

894
01:07:16,531 --> 01:07:18,903
sundown,
the Sam Kinison Monument.

895
01:07:18,992 --> 01:07:21,068
Why in the fuck out there?

896
01:07:21,161 --> 01:07:24,944
Listen, I can't even find any warrants
in the system for these four.

897
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:28,124
The system hasn't been updated is all.

898
01:07:46,142 --> 01:07:48,551
- Hey.
- How you doing?

899
01:07:51,357 --> 01:07:54,726
- This is all an act, isn't it?
- What is?

900
01:07:54,819 --> 01:07:58,484
This... this whole tough chick thing.

901
01:07:59,824 --> 01:08:01,900
What makes you so sure?

902
01:08:02,534 --> 01:08:04,742
I'm an actor.

903
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:07,701
You can't fake it like we can.

904
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:10,456
You know what I think?

905
01:08:10,544 --> 01:08:14,293
I think you're just a scared little girl
with some serious daddy issues.

906
01:08:27,855 --> 01:08:30,347
Motherfucker!

907
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:33,684
You... you broke my fuckin' nose!

908
01:08:37,324 --> 01:08:39,116
Thanks.

909
01:08:41,162 --> 01:08:43,866
My friend Tina,
she thought you were dead.

910
01:08:43,956 --> 01:08:48,665
Really? Well, tell your friend Tina...
she's a whore.

911
01:09:00,642 --> 01:09:03,642
- It's still bleeding.
- I can't believe this fucking bitch.

912
01:09:03,728 --> 01:09:05,851
- I'm sorry!

913
01:09:09,109 --> 01:09:11,099
Where are the bond certificates?

914
01:09:11,191 --> 01:09:13,895
There are no bond certificates.

915
01:09:16,697 --> 01:09:18,405
Claremont didn't provide them?

916
01:09:18,490 --> 01:09:20,982
He didn't give me anything.

917
01:09:21,076 --> 01:09:24,077
Hey, Claremont said
drop the First Ladies off in Needles,

918
01:09:24,162 --> 01:09:27,449
go home and don't ask any questions.

919
01:09:32,673 --> 01:09:37,300
There's only one reason that we
wouldn't have any bond certificates.

920
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:45,979
These guys have never been arrested.

921
01:09:47,856 --> 01:09:50,774
Is this an inside job?

922
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:18,048
- No, that's bullshit...
- Do you believe what's going on?

923
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:21,058
No, I didn't sign on for this shit, Terry.
I got punched in the...

924
01:10:21,143 --> 01:10:24,145
Get the fuckin' camera
off me right now, please.

925
01:10:25,814 --> 01:10:30,441
Put down the camera.
Turn the fucking camera off!

926
01:10:30,528 --> 01:10:33,019
What happens now?

927
01:10:33,114 --> 01:10:34,906
The tour is cancelled.

928
01:10:34,991 --> 01:10:37,364
You drove us to Needles
to put us in jail?

929
01:10:37,452 --> 01:10:39,860
Come on, move! Getup. Come on.

930
01:10:39,955 --> 01:10:42,244
Turn the fucking camera off!

931
01:10:42,333 --> 01:10:44,705
Don't listen to her. Keep filming.

932
01:10:44,793 --> 01:10:46,073
Fucker!

933
01:10:55,009 --> 01:10:57,002
Fuck!

934
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:12,438
- I ain't worth this shit.
- Shut the fuck up and walk.

935
01:11:12,529 --> 01:11:14,189
- These aren't cops.
- No shit.

936
01:11:14,281 --> 01:11:16,273
Watch your mouth. God is listening.

937
01:11:16,366 --> 01:11:18,405
Come over here, good-looking.

938
01:11:18,493 --> 01:11:20,569
Here's your First Ladies.

939
01:11:20,662 --> 01:11:23,498
Pleasure doing business with you.

940
01:11:23,582 --> 01:11:26,073
She told me she was 18.

941
01:11:39,558 --> 01:11:42,763
- Ow. Fuck!
- I hit my head, too.

942
01:11:42,855 --> 01:11:47,563
Why the fuck are we staying
in this shithole? This is ridiculous.

943
01:11:47,651 --> 01:11:49,359
Guys.

944
01:11:51,697 --> 01:11:54,983
The footage we captured for that
was phenomenal.

945
01:11:55,076 --> 01:11:56,902
Did you get the broken fuckin' nose?

946
01:11:56,993 --> 01:11:59,782
- It's gonna jump start your careers.
- Fuck, yeah.

947
01:11:59,873 --> 01:12:02,115
Look at my face!

948
01:12:02,209 --> 01:12:04,166
It's all good.

949
01:12:08,131 --> 01:12:11,500
You need to start thinking more
positively. We need to celebrate.

950
01:12:11,593 --> 01:12:14,714
- We need to go to, like, a strip club.
- All right.

951
01:12:25,693 --> 01:12:28,183
Something awful
was about to happen.

952
01:12:41,664 --> 01:12:43,906
I could feel it in my bones.

953
01:13:12,282 --> 01:13:16,159
What?

954
01:13:28,507 --> 01:13:31,295
Do you mind if I ask you a question?

955
01:13:33,012 --> 01:13:35,764
Do I look like I speak Spanish?

956
01:13:36,808 --> 01:13:40,260
Do I look South American to you?
I don't understand

957
01:13:40,354 --> 01:13:41,979
a word you're fucking saying.

958
01:13:42,065 --> 01:13:45,269
You know what? Ed's right.
It's not cute. It's not fucking cute!

959
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:48,776
It's never been fucking cute, Choco!
I don't fucking understand you!

960
01:13:48,863 --> 01:13:50,821
You're a freak!

961
01:14:21,186 --> 01:14:25,731
Man, they never show the cum shots
in these shitbag motels.

962
01:14:47,091 --> 01:14:52,880
Jesus Christ, Choco. I just got done
paying 12.95 for this movie.

963
01:14:52,971 --> 01:14:57,266
- I'm never gonna know how it ends.
- Don't fuck with me, Ed.

964
01:14:57,351 --> 01:15:00,601
Listen, Choco, don't go goddamn
King Kong on me, OK?

965
01:15:00,687 --> 01:15:04,355
If you want to be alone...
if you need me, I'll tell you what...

966
01:15:04,444 --> 01:15:07,564
I'll be in Domino's room.
I'll be makin' up my own ending.

967
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:10,481
Shut up!

968
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:14,615
Come on, boy.
I'm gonna whip your ass,

969
01:15:14,704 --> 01:15:18,370
and then I'm gonna whip your
goddamn girlfriend's ass.

970
01:15:21,670 --> 01:15:25,004
- Do it!
- Hey, wait a minute...

971
01:15:28,511 --> 01:15:31,001
What are you doing? Over this?!

972
01:15:31,096 --> 01:15:33,469
- Pull the fuckin' trigger.
- I will fucking pull it!

973
01:15:33,557 --> 01:15:36,228
I know it comes easy
to a fucker like you.

974
01:15:36,311 --> 01:15:39,432
Pull it. Pull the trigger.

975
01:15:41,858 --> 01:15:45,359
You think I don't know
what the fuck's goin' on?

976
01:15:47,324 --> 01:15:49,649
Let me tell you something.

977
01:15:51,865 --> 01:15:53,943
You see this?

978
01:15:55,037 --> 01:15:57,493
There was no prison riot.

979
01:15:57,957 --> 01:16:00,411
I blew off my own goddamn toe.

980
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:04,795
Just to numb the pain.

981
01:16:05,798 --> 01:16:08,882
Let me tell you something...
we all get weak over women.

982
01:16:09,636 --> 01:16:12,423
We all get weak over women.

983
01:16:13,765 --> 01:16:17,265
Fuckin' broads are all nuts.
They know how to kill us.

984
01:16:17,352 --> 01:16:19,060
And this kid in there...

985
01:16:19,146 --> 01:16:21,517
she's killin' you.

986
01:17:05,613 --> 01:17:07,987
Who are you?

987
01:17:18,712 --> 01:17:20,420
Sir...

988
01:17:20,506 --> 01:17:22,961
You want me to shoot 'em
in the kneecaps?

989
01:17:23,050 --> 01:17:26,585
Now, you listen to me.
Hold on one second.

990
01:17:28,097 --> 01:17:30,880
Ask them politely where the money is.

991
01:17:30,971 --> 01:17:34,839
If they don't know, just tell them
to start digging their own graves.

992
01:17:34,934 --> 01:17:37,010
OK.

993
01:17:48,407 --> 01:17:50,781
- Yeah. Hello?
- Mr. Cigliutti?

994
01:17:50,869 --> 01:17:54,035
I'm calling from the Zeta Theta Theta
house at Cal West LA.

995
01:17:54,122 --> 01:17:57,622
- Yes, yes. What is it?
- I'm sorry to be bothering you.

996
01:17:57,709 --> 01:17:59,916
- It's a bit of an emergency.
- What?

997
01:18:00,003 --> 01:18:04,416
Your sons have been kidnapped
by these crazy game show hosts.

998
01:18:04,507 --> 01:18:08,589
Wait, wait, wait. My sons Frances
and Charlie have been kidnapped?

999
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,589
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

1000
01:18:16,354 --> 01:18:21,147
We don't know about any money.
We were just going to get fake IDs.

1001
01:18:21,234 --> 01:18:25,813
Forgive us, O Lord,
for our daily trespasses...

1002
01:18:27,158 --> 01:18:29,567
for we know not what we do,

1003
01:18:29,662 --> 01:18:32,331
and what we see...

1004
01:18:32,622 --> 01:18:34,580
may not be the truth.

1005
01:18:35,208 --> 01:18:38,993
I'm gonna fill up the tank and grab
a Mountain Dew. Don't make a peep.

1006
01:18:39,088 --> 01:18:40,334
Especially you, Barbara.

1007
01:18:41,883 --> 01:18:46,462
The three sassy black women
and Raul were the real First Ladies.

1008
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:50,264
- What now?
- I don't know.

1009
01:18:57,525 --> 01:18:59,352
Hello? Where are you?!

1010
01:18:59,444 --> 01:19:02,943
I'm pullin' up right now.
Evacuate the van, Tee.

1011
01:19:03,031 --> 01:19:05,652
Plans have changed.
We setup the wrong guys.

1012
01:19:12,788 --> 01:19:15,706
The four guys we nabbed
were just Lateesha's patsies.

1013
01:19:15,791 --> 01:19:18,627
It was her sorry luck
they were connected to the mob.

1014
01:19:18,711 --> 01:19:20,918
Get out! Get out of the car!

1015
01:19:40,943 --> 01:19:43,731
You have fucked us so bad.

1016
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:45,612
- I fucked up?
- You heard me.

1017
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:49,567
You can't help your black, greedy, lyin'
ass from tryin' to get every fuckin' thing.

1018
01:19:49,661 --> 01:19:54,039
All you did is put a death sentence
on my grandbaby. That's all you did.

1019
01:19:54,250 --> 01:19:57,370
- Did you know what I was trying to do?
- What?

1020
01:19:57,462 --> 01:19:59,704
What was you tryin' to do, Claremont?!

1021
01:19:59,798 --> 01:20:02,419
- I ain't talkin' to y'all.
- What was you tryin' to get done?

1022
01:20:02,509 --> 01:20:05,179
Shut the fuck up! Everybody!

1023
01:20:05,262 --> 01:20:07,255
You mad because you fucked up!

1024
01:20:07,348 --> 01:20:09,222
Who told you to get
those boys involved?

1025
01:20:09,308 --> 01:20:11,017
What the fuck else did you want?!

1026
01:20:11,102 --> 01:20:13,225
Let's go home right now!

1027
01:20:33,544 --> 01:20:34,374
Hi.

1028
01:20:34,461 --> 01:20:36,537
Domino, we got a problem.

1029
01:20:36,629 --> 01:20:40,379
Lateesha's assumed
the FBI was onto the scam...

1030
01:20:40,468 --> 01:20:42,378
the fake ID scam.

1031
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:45,043
She sets up these college kids.

1032
01:20:45,139 --> 01:20:48,805
These kids have been under
FBI surveillance for the last 6 months.

1033
01:20:48,893 --> 01:20:52,389
- What happened to them?
- They might be dead already.

1034
01:20:55,980 --> 01:21:01,272
There's something else
you should know about these kids.

1035
01:21:01,361 --> 01:21:05,027
They're Mafia kids, Cigliutti's kids.

1036
01:21:05,281 --> 01:21:07,773
Jesus Christ.

1037
01:21:07,868 --> 01:21:12,780
What, Anthony Cigliutti? Fuck,
Claremont! You've so fucked us up.

1038
01:21:12,874 --> 01:21:16,244
You set me up to deliver...

1039
01:21:16,336 --> 01:21:21,046
fucking Mafia crime boss children
to be executed.

1040
01:21:21,133 --> 01:21:26,091
Just relax. Just follow my instructions
and we all walk away from this clean.

1041
01:21:28,225 --> 01:21:30,716
Claremont laid it
all out on the table.

1042
01:21:30,811 --> 01:21:34,097
His plan was to ask for
a 300,000 dollars finder's fee

1043
01:21:34,190 --> 01:21:38,567
to recover the 10 million he'd stolen.
It all became a huge cluster fuck

1044
01:21:38,652 --> 01:21:42,864
when Lateesha tried to pin it
on the Cigliutti kids.

1045
01:21:42,948 --> 01:21:45,073
Now our only chance for survival

1046
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:47,781
was to stay on course
and retrieve the money.

1047
01:21:47,871 --> 01:21:49,495
Alf, come on!

1048
01:21:49,581 --> 01:21:53,994
First priority was to cut loose
the crew and sabotage the footage.

1049
01:21:54,086 --> 01:21:55,462
We couldn't leave
any evidence behind.

1050
01:21:55,547 --> 01:21:57,871
Come on, guys! It's time to go!

1051
01:21:57,965 --> 01:22:01,252
Alf, go grab all the footage,
every tape you see. Come on!

1052
01:22:01,345 --> 01:22:05,011
We gotta go find Locus Fender.
He knows exactly where the money is.

1053
01:22:05,099 --> 01:22:09,559
We find the money, we return it to
Bishop, we're in the clear. Come on!

1054
01:22:12,189 --> 01:22:13,518
I knew in my heart of hearts

1055
01:22:13,608 --> 01:22:16,313
we should've stopped
when my goldfish died.

1056
01:22:16,401 --> 01:22:18,976
It was a sign from a higher power.

1057
01:22:20,115 --> 01:22:22,867
Alf!

1058
01:22:24,328 --> 01:22:27,162
For fuck's sake, Alf!

1059
01:22:30,538 --> 01:22:33,077
Where the fuck are the tapes?

1060
01:23:03,784 --> 01:23:05,444
Based on Claremont's plan,

1061
01:23:05,536 --> 01:23:08,703
we joined forces with
Lashandra and Lashindra.

1062
01:23:10,917 --> 01:23:13,159
- You want a lap dance?
- Yeah.

1063
01:23:13,253 --> 01:23:16,587
Tonight we have a 2-for-1 special
for these luscious tits.

1064
01:23:16,673 --> 01:23:18,796
Luscious tits.

1065
01:23:19,343 --> 01:23:21,715
Come on. Come on, baby.

1066
01:23:33,192 --> 01:23:37,142
What's goin' on?
What the fuck?! I didn't do anything!

1067
01:23:41,451 --> 01:23:45,366
I kicked ass at the fucking audition.
Seriously, I really was great.

1068
01:23:49,083 --> 01:23:51,206
My agent called
and says that I'm too old.

1069
01:23:59,554 --> 01:24:02,306
Ian, how you doing?
You all right? Yeah?

1070
01:24:20,531 --> 01:24:22,987
Domino, Domino,
now, listen to me.

1071
01:24:23,075 --> 01:24:25,365
The combination code is
tattooed on his right arm.

1072
01:24:25,453 --> 01:24:27,991
You will never get inside
Edna Fender's safe

1073
01:24:28,081 --> 01:24:32,329
unless you have the code breaker
on that arm. Understand?

1074
01:24:32,419 --> 01:24:34,329
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.

1075
01:24:34,421 --> 01:24:36,877
Listen, Edna's armed and dangerous...

1076
01:24:36,966 --> 01:24:38,591
So don't fuck around.

1077
01:24:38,676 --> 01:24:41,843
- What?
- Remove the right arm.

1078
01:24:41,930 --> 01:24:45,845
- You're breaking up.
- Domino, remove the right arm.

1079
01:24:52,316 --> 01:24:56,065
Remove his shirt
from his upper right arm.

1080
01:24:56,154 --> 01:25:00,021
You'll find the combination inside
the tattoo on his arm. You got me?

1081
01:25:17,427 --> 01:25:19,798
What did he say?

1082
01:25:26,980 --> 01:25:29,980
He said, "Remove the right arm."

1083
01:26:49,651 --> 01:26:51,559
You're fuckin' crazy!

1084
01:26:52,444 --> 01:26:53,773
Phew!

1085
01:26:53,863 --> 01:26:56,817
My fuckin' arm!

1086
01:27:14,843 --> 01:27:17,549
So, now we're back where we started.

1087
01:27:18,890 --> 01:27:20,219
We sure are.

1088
01:27:24,731 --> 01:27:28,859
Edna! You beautiful thing, come on out.

1089
01:27:29,110 --> 01:27:31,893
We found the money in the freezer.
It was all there.

1090
01:27:39,243 --> 01:27:41,699
That's a lot to carry.

1091
01:27:44,623 --> 01:27:49,084
How about a pot of coffee, Edna?
It's gonna be a long night.

1092
01:27:50,004 --> 01:27:52,161
...part light-induced, part drug.

1093
01:27:57,762 --> 01:28:03,005
Turned out Edna
had one last trick up her sleeve.

1094
01:28:14,072 --> 01:28:16,564
Cocksuckers gonna pay.

1095
01:28:20,454 --> 01:28:22,779
Mescaline.

1096
01:28:23,957 --> 01:28:26,746
With each passing second,

1097
01:28:26,836 --> 01:28:30,669
reality eclipsed
into the asphalt horizon.

1098
01:28:34,219 --> 01:28:37,670
Soon, the mescaline was
pulsing through our veins.

1099
01:28:40,184 --> 01:28:43,351
...pulsing through our veins.

1100
01:29:43,542 --> 01:29:46,329
There is mescaline in your system,

1101
01:29:46,419 --> 01:29:48,626
but I'm guessing it's nothing new.

1102
01:29:49,381 --> 01:29:51,956
It's not unusual for someone like you...

1103
01:29:54,804 --> 01:29:57,342
pampered her whole life...

1104
01:29:58,725 --> 01:30:02,853
to indulge in drugs
as a coping mechanism.

1105
01:30:05,857 --> 01:30:08,563
Not living up to your expectations.

1106
01:30:10,322 --> 01:30:13,323
Certainly not up to your mother's.

1107
01:30:13,993 --> 01:30:16,400
You know you're a heartbreak to her,
don't you?

1108
01:30:17,162 --> 01:30:20,199
Now the bitch
was getting personal.

1109
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:45,388
You lost everything that belongs to you.

1110
01:30:45,484 --> 01:30:47,643
You can take responsibility for it, or not.

1111
01:30:47,737 --> 01:30:51,317
Either way, you've got
no one to blame but yourself.

1112
01:32:32,678 --> 01:32:34,967
Hey, there's someone coming.

1113
01:32:44,608 --> 01:32:46,435
Hey!

1114
01:32:47,277 --> 01:32:49,353
David!

1115
01:32:54,328 --> 01:32:55,906
We need help.

1116
01:32:55,997 --> 01:32:59,496
Miracles. You're all miracles.

1117
01:32:59,583 --> 01:33:01,909
Thank you! Thank God!

1118
01:33:24,151 --> 01:33:26,274
What's your name?

1119
01:33:27,155 --> 01:33:29,147
Domino.

1120
01:33:36,833 --> 01:33:39,406
I know you.

1121
01:33:42,797 --> 01:33:44,874
You're the angel of fire.

1122
01:33:44,967 --> 01:33:47,174
Angel of fire.

1123
01:33:50,055 --> 01:33:51,715
I know you.

1124
01:33:51,807 --> 01:33:54,678
You burn bright enough
to know there are certain sacrifices

1125
01:33:54,769 --> 01:33:57,342
that need to be made.

1126
01:34:03,487 --> 01:34:07,355
You see, if you don't give back
the money, you all will die.

1127
01:34:09,784 --> 01:34:14,609
And you will die contorted,
and you will die unforgiven.

1128
01:34:14,703 --> 01:34:19,662
You see, there's... there's this...
this puzzle,

1129
01:34:19,751 --> 01:34:22,871
and at the centre of this puzzle,
there's a child,

1130
01:34:22,963 --> 01:34:25,501
and this is a very sick child.

1131
01:34:25,591 --> 01:34:27,880
Avery sick child.

1132
01:34:31,054 --> 01:34:34,507
But this child will be
a great leader someday.

1133
01:34:34,601 --> 01:34:37,270
Do you know the child I speak of?

1134
01:34:38,105 --> 01:34:39,812
Yes.

1135
01:34:40,565 --> 01:34:45,607
Well, you have only one destiny,
and that destiny is...

1136
01:34:46,905 --> 01:34:51,532
that you must offer your lives
in exchange for the life of the child.

1137
01:34:52,161 --> 01:34:54,070
Then, and only then,

1138
01:34:54,163 --> 01:34:57,783
will you truly be cleansed
in the blood of the lamb.

1139
01:35:09,139 --> 01:35:11,297
Take us to Vegas.

1140
01:35:48,766 --> 01:35:50,588
It's official.

1141
01:35:51,556 --> 01:35:54,177
Bishop whacked Frances and Chuckie.

1142
01:35:57,312 --> 01:36:00,764
- What's our options?
- What's your options?

1143
01:36:06,531 --> 01:36:08,025
Kill them.

1144
01:36:08,116 --> 01:36:11,235
When?

1145
01:36:14,372 --> 01:36:16,829
- When?
- Tonight!

1146
01:36:16,917 --> 01:36:18,577
Kill them all.

1147
01:36:18,669 --> 01:36:20,792
Kill them all tonight!

1148
01:36:24,092 --> 01:36:25,670
Go! Go!

1149
01:36:25,761 --> 01:36:28,003
Let's go! Move it out!

1150
01:36:39,818 --> 01:36:43,732
You know, we discovered the bodies
early this morning.

1151
01:36:44,989 --> 01:36:46,863
The FBI was lying.

1152
01:36:46,950 --> 01:36:49,786
The guys we nabbed
weren't dead after all.

1153
01:37:00,298 --> 01:37:03,964
Please, I just supply them with pussy.

1154
01:37:04,052 --> 01:37:07,304
I just want to get people high, man.

1155
01:37:08,767 --> 01:37:10,641
Fuck 'em. They don't know.

1156
01:37:39,713 --> 01:37:41,790
Fuck, this shit's intense.

1157
01:37:41,883 --> 01:37:45,002
Ian, just do what they say.
I don't feel like getting killed.

1158
01:37:45,094 --> 01:37:47,217
We need you to book us
a hotel suite.

1159
01:37:47,305 --> 01:37:50,057
- What, with my money?
- Put it on your credit card.

1160
01:37:50,141 --> 01:37:53,841
Are you serious?
OK, don't look at me that way.

1161
01:38:08,619 --> 01:38:10,279
- This is Bishop.
- Mr Bishop,

1162
01:38:10,371 --> 01:38:13,326
the bounty hunters have arrived.
Where do you want to meet?

1163
01:38:13,416 --> 01:38:17,117
Top of the World at the Stratosphere.
Yeah, it's completely secure.

1164
01:38:17,212 --> 01:38:22,171
We'll drop off the money in exactly
one hour. Should we say, 7pm?

1165
01:38:22,259 --> 01:38:23,802
Yeah, good.

1166
01:38:23,886 --> 01:38:29,095
We'll drop off the money in exactly
one hour. Should we say, 7pm?

1167
01:38:29,185 --> 01:38:32,885
All right, boys, we're in business.

1168
01:38:37,902 --> 01:38:41,567
We could let Cigliutti think
that the kids are still dead.

1169
01:38:41,656 --> 01:38:45,701
Yeah, and then we can flush out
Cigliutti in the money exchange.

1170
01:38:45,786 --> 01:38:48,158
Yeah!

1171
01:38:50,332 --> 01:38:53,333
Wilson...
They're on the move.

1172
01:39:00,509 --> 01:39:01,589
Yeah, what?

1173
01:39:01,677 --> 01:39:04,715
Yeah, Mr Cigliutti, the money exchange
with Drake Bishop

1174
01:39:04,807 --> 01:39:09,965
will occur on the top floor suite of
the Stratosphere at exactly 7pm.

1175
01:39:11,394 --> 01:39:15,722
Sounds like we got a negro
Deep Throat here. Right?

1176
01:39:18,651 --> 01:39:21,225
Man, we are so fucked.

1177
01:39:22,531 --> 01:39:26,030
Yeah, well, that guy said
we were fucked either way.

1178
01:39:35,669 --> 01:39:38,541
- Hello?
- Domino...

1179
01:39:38,631 --> 01:39:43,543
the money exchange will take place
at Top of the World, Stratosphere.

1180
01:39:43,637 --> 01:39:46,722
And I need you
to get there right at 7pm.

1181
01:39:48,059 --> 01:39:52,852
I'm sorry it turned out like this.
I won't forget this, Domino.

1182
01:40:23,472 --> 01:40:25,678
Get off.

1183
01:40:29,688 --> 01:40:31,765
Lateesha.

1184
01:40:32,775 --> 01:40:35,526
What the fuck have you gotten us into?

1185
01:40:35,611 --> 01:40:39,276
Claremont negotiated a findera's fee
for 300,000 dollars.

1186
01:40:39,365 --> 01:40:41,856
He fucked it up
'cause he tried to take all of it.

1187
01:40:41,951 --> 01:40:44,953
- Bullshit. You set us up.
- Fuck you.

1188
01:40:51,082 --> 01:40:54,748
Domino, if I could take it all back,
I would.

1189
01:40:56,003 --> 01:40:59,289
Well, they're gonna kill us
if we don't deliver all the money.

1190
01:41:09,645 --> 01:41:13,346
300,000 dollars, and I need to collect
that fee right now.

1191
01:41:14,817 --> 01:41:18,400
It'll pay for my baby's entire operation.

1192
01:41:19,113 --> 01:41:21,356
Please.

1193
01:41:36,590 --> 01:41:39,378
Alf, what the fuck
are you doing in there?!

1194
01:41:39,469 --> 01:41:40,879
Alf!

1195
01:41:42,764 --> 01:41:46,512
Wanker, cut the drama.
I need 300k from one of the bags.

1196
01:42:13,757 --> 01:42:15,915
I love you, Domino.

1197
01:42:16,009 --> 01:42:17,586
Thank you.

1198
01:42:41,867 --> 01:42:45,948
This is your last chance. Once I walk
out that door, I can't help you.

1199
01:42:47,623 --> 01:42:50,161
You have a fondness for tattoos.

1200
01:42:53,129 --> 01:42:56,463
You've been staring
at my goldfish all afternoon.

1201
01:42:57,926 --> 01:43:00,002
It's a koi, actually.

1202
01:43:00,095 --> 01:43:02,337
The Japanese refer
to them as shiro muji,

1203
01:43:02,431 --> 01:43:05,183
which, translated, means "white...

1204
01:43:06,102 --> 01:43:08,307
and nothing else."

1205
01:43:10,481 --> 01:43:13,519
Do you know why I really
became a bounty hunter?

1206
01:43:14,112 --> 01:43:16,603
Because of cunts like me?

1207
01:43:20,451 --> 01:43:24,366
It kills you that
while I'm coming into my own,

1208
01:43:24,456 --> 01:43:27,457
you're stuck
in some dead-end marriage.

1209
01:43:27,542 --> 01:43:30,115
Or, worse yet, an unfulfilling job.

1210
01:43:30,211 --> 01:43:32,834
I'm not married.

1211
01:43:33,382 --> 01:43:36,218
And I love my job.

1212
01:43:37,804 --> 01:43:39,926
Where are you hiding your tattoo?

1213
01:43:40,014 --> 01:43:41,638
Is it on your ankle?

1214
01:43:41,724 --> 01:43:44,595
No. Or is it somewhere else?

1215
01:43:44,686 --> 01:43:47,260
Is it somewhere nasty?

1216
01:43:48,149 --> 01:43:51,351
I'm picturing something...
picturing something delicate,

1217
01:43:51,443 --> 01:43:54,979
like a rose, or... or a hummingbird.

1218
01:43:55,073 --> 01:43:57,825
Or, no. Maybe it's the name of a man

1219
01:43:57,910 --> 01:44:00,234
that you can't bring home to Daddy.

1220
01:44:03,875 --> 01:44:05,832
No.

1221
01:44:05,919 --> 01:44:09,168
No, I'm completely wrong,
aren't I, Taryn?

1222
01:44:09,255 --> 01:44:10,626
God.

1223
01:44:10,711 --> 01:44:13,961
See, I bet... I'm thinking...

1224
01:44:14,048 --> 01:44:17,666
that when you go to sleep
alone tonight...

1225
01:44:18,844 --> 01:44:21,217
it's my pussy you'll be dreaming of.

1226
01:44:21,848 --> 01:44:23,757
Really?

1227
01:46:03,623 --> 01:46:05,166
Brian...

1228
01:46:05,876 --> 01:46:07,750
I love you, bro.

1229
01:46:49,173 --> 01:46:51,546
Welcome to the Top of the World.

1230
01:46:56,014 --> 01:46:59,265
It's a little out of the way,
but, very private.

1231
01:47:02,604 --> 01:47:04,762
Where have I seen
you two boys before?

1232
01:47:04,856 --> 01:47:06,814
We're actors.

1233
01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:08,775
What the fuck are you doing here?

1234
01:47:08,862 --> 01:47:12,277
- We're celebrity hostages.
- Celebrity hostages?

1235
01:47:12,365 --> 01:47:14,856
Yeah. Apparently, people
don't kill other people

1236
01:47:14,951 --> 01:47:17,656
when celebrities are around.

1237
01:47:18,414 --> 01:47:20,537
Brings too much attention.

1238
01:47:21,668 --> 01:47:23,410
I see.

1239
01:47:23,502 --> 01:47:27,371
Well, I'd better have you
escorted downstairs, then.

1240
01:47:45,648 --> 01:47:48,221
You got lucky.

1241
01:48:01,541 --> 01:48:03,913
Go! Let's go!

1242
01:48:15,514 --> 01:48:17,638
And you're a...

1243
01:48:18,059 --> 01:48:20,301
a bounty hunter.

1244
01:48:25,942 --> 01:48:29,062
- Yes, I am.
- Dangerous profession.

1245
01:48:32,241 --> 01:48:34,399
Sometimes.

1246
01:48:40,375 --> 01:48:42,452
Will maintain visual contact...

1247
01:48:42,545 --> 01:48:46,043
Will maintain visual contact with
the tactical team that's on location.

1248
01:48:47,674 --> 01:48:51,720
Could you... could you be
a little bit more specific about that?

1249
01:48:54,182 --> 01:48:58,096
It can be dangerous when you don't
know what to expect from a situation.

1250
01:49:06,362 --> 01:49:10,736
When you have absolutely no idea
what could possibly happen next.

1251
01:49:19,204 --> 01:49:22,790
The bags contain the 10 million,
minus the 300,000 dollars finder's fee

1252
01:49:22,877 --> 01:49:25,035
you negotiated with Claremont.

1253
01:49:25,462 --> 01:49:30,837
Well, now, that's...
that's what I call bold, Miss Harvey.

1254
01:49:31,302 --> 01:49:34,552
But I'm impressed.
I'm very impressed.

1255
01:49:34,638 --> 01:49:36,263
Go!

1256
01:49:42,857 --> 01:49:47,602
All right, gentlemen, let's make sure that
those bags are packed with my money,

1257
01:49:47,695 --> 01:49:51,396
and we'll let these bounty hunters go.

1258
01:49:51,491 --> 01:49:53,614
Your money's gone.

1259
01:49:55,954 --> 01:49:57,863
What?

1260
01:50:02,629 --> 01:50:03,827
What are you talking about?

1261
01:50:03,922 --> 01:50:07,088
It has been sent
to help free Afghanistan.

1262
01:50:07,175 --> 01:50:08,717
Let us go.

1263
01:50:10,387 --> 01:50:13,223
- Let us go.
- What the fuck are you doing?

1264
01:50:22,233 --> 01:50:24,143
It's a bomb!

1265
01:50:46,552 --> 01:50:48,960
OK, drop the weapons!

1266
01:50:56,642 --> 01:51:01,351
- You killed my sons.
- I didn't kill your sons.

1267
01:51:01,814 --> 01:51:04,650
I'm not in the people-killing business.

1268
01:51:10,365 --> 01:51:11,445
No!

1269
01:51:34,350 --> 01:51:35,893
Alf!

1270
01:51:37,437 --> 01:51:41,482
- What the fuck's going on up there?
- Get somebody in there!

1271
01:52:01,546 --> 01:52:04,216
Mayday, mayday. This is Victor Bravo.
We're going down.

1272
01:52:06,927 --> 01:52:08,885
Repeat, I'm going down.

1273
01:52:12,017 --> 01:52:13,975
Heads, you live.

1274
01:52:14,687 --> 01:52:16,644
Tails, you die.

1275
01:52:18,398 --> 01:52:20,641
Tails, you die.

1276
01:52:25,490 --> 01:52:27,233
Tails, you die.

1277
01:52:44,215 --> 01:52:46,920
Move back, for fuck's sake!

1278
01:52:57,271 --> 01:52:59,144
No!

1279
01:53:36,690 --> 01:53:39,227
Come on, Alf!

1280
01:54:00,715 --> 01:54:02,209
I make...

1281
01:54:04,135 --> 01:54:07,340
I make everything... OK.

1282
01:54:11,432 --> 01:54:13,508
My coin was tossed.

1283
01:54:13,601 --> 01:54:16,223
50/50 chance.

1284
01:54:50,600 --> 01:54:53,174
Put it down, or I'll blow
your fuckin' brains out!

1285
01:54:56,148 --> 01:54:57,976
Fuckin' shoot him!

1286
01:55:19,632 --> 01:55:23,083
I once vowed never to invest
too much emotion into anyone.

1287
01:55:23,177 --> 01:55:25,585
- I love you.
- I love you.

1288
01:55:30,267 --> 01:55:32,511
I love you, Choco.

1289
01:55:38,904 --> 01:55:42,189
50/50 chance. Life or death.

1290
01:55:42,282 --> 01:55:43,776
Heads, you live.

1291
01:55:43,867 --> 01:55:45,943
Tails, you die.

1292
01:55:53,165 --> 01:55:55,074
My destiny was life.

1293
01:55:59,422 --> 01:56:01,497
When I was a little girl,

1294
01:56:01,590 --> 01:56:04,164
my mum took me to Las Vegas.

1295
01:56:06,471 --> 01:56:10,220
She told me that it was the most
dangerous place on earth.

1296
01:56:32,291 --> 01:56:35,411
Miss Harvey, I suggest you retire.

1297
01:56:36,712 --> 01:56:38,753
Sweet dreams, Miss Mills.

1298
01:56:40,050 --> 01:56:43,004
My name is Domino Harvey.

1299
01:56:44,304 --> 01:56:46,630
I am a bounty hunter.

1300
01:56:49,477 --> 01:56:54,270
I know that my Eddie and Choco are
staring down at me from the afterlife.

1301
01:56:57,153 --> 01:57:00,985
I now feel a sense of relief
that we will meet again.

1302
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:12,750
Mum...

1303
01:57:14,838 --> 01:57:16,748
I love you.

1304
01:57:23,472 --> 01:57:26,307
There are three kinds of people
in the world...

1305
01:57:28,228 --> 01:57:30,513
The rich...

1306
01:57:39,654 --> 01:57:41,611
The poor...

1307
01:57:55,295 --> 01:57:57,703
And everyone in between.

1308
01:58:01,845 --> 01:58:05,178
- I'm Dr Walton.
- Mr Williams.

1309
01:58:05,890 --> 01:58:08,216
Kee Kee Rodriguez.

1310
01:58:08,310 --> 01:58:10,386
- I'm her mother, Lateesha.
- We're her cousins.

1311
01:58:10,479 --> 01:58:11,724
First cousins.

1312
01:58:11,813 --> 01:58:15,680
It seems that we
have a few things we have to look at.

1313
01:58:16,736 --> 01:58:18,860
If you're wondering
what's true and what isn't,

1314
01:58:18,947 --> 01:58:22,483
fuck off, because it's
none of your goddamn business.

1315
01:58:22,576 --> 01:58:25,327
I'll never tell you what it all meant.

1316
01:58:25,412 --> 01:58:28,247
I'll never tell you
what it all meant.

1317
01:58:29,375 --> 01:58:33,419
All that matters is
that my mission is complete.

1318
01:58:44,224 --> 01:58:46,051
I saved her.

1319
01:58:49,187 --> 01:58:50,848
And when she is older...

1320
01:58:52,984 --> 01:58:54,644
A woman named Domino will tell her

1321
01:58:54,735 --> 01:58:58,687
that there is only one
conclusion to every story...

1322
01:59:00,159 --> 01:59:02,650
We all fall down.

1323
02:00:24,331 --> 02:00:27,082
My name is Domino Harvey.

1324
02:00:37,595 --> 02:00:40,133
Heads, you live.

1325
02:00:41,305 --> 02:00:47,297
