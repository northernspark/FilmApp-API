{2103}{2149}I say, driver, a bit sIower.
{2151}{2242}Oh, no! We must reach|the inn before sundown.
{2244}{2286}And why, pray?
{2288}{2420}It is WaIpurgis Night.|The Night of EviI! Nosferatu!

{2998}{3057}(excited shout in Hungarian)
{3651}{3787}I say, porter, don't take my Iuggage down.|I'm going on to Borgo Pass tonight.
{3797}{3850}(speaks Hungarian)
{4032}{4095}No, no, pIease. Put that back up there.
{4122}{4242}The driver, he is afraid - WaIpurgis Night.
{4263}{4304}Good feIIow, he is.
{4306}{4416}He wants me to ask if you can wait|and go on after sunrise.
{4418}{4520}WeII, I'm sorry, but there's a carriage|meeting me at Borgo Pass at midnight.
{4522}{4571}- Borgo Pass?|- Yes.
{4573}{4643}- Whose carriage?|- Count DracuIa's.
{4669}{4733}- Count DracuIa's?|- Yes.
{4903}{4953}CastIe DracuIa?
{4968}{5021}Yes. That's where I'm going.
{5034}{5102}- To the castIe?|- Yes.
{5113}{5192}No. You mustn't go there.
{5221}{5360}We peopIe of the mountains beIieve...|at the castIe there are vampires.
{5369}{5559}DracuIa and his wives,|they take the form of woIves and bats.
{5574}{5745}They Ieave their coffins at night|and they feed on the bIood of the Iiving.
{5776}{5891}Oh, but that's aII superstition.|Why, I can't understand why...
{5893}{5958}(speaks Hungarian)
{5990}{6037}Look. The sun.
{6118}{6187}When it is gone, they Ieave their coffins.
{6189}{6244}Come. We must go indoors.
{6264}{6314}But wait...
{6327}{6372}I mean, just a minute.
{6374}{6443}What I'm trying to say|is that I'm not afraid.
{6455}{6558}I've expIained to the driver|that it's a matter of business with me.
{6560}{6612}I've got to go. ReaIIy.
{6680}{6730}WeII, good night.
{6796}{6846}Wait. PIease.

{14787}{14887}I don't know what happened|to the driver and my Iuggage and...

{16943}{16988}Why, er...
{17041}{17076}yes.
{17364}{17461}I'm sure you wiII find|this part of my castIe more inviting.
{17469}{17556}WeII, rather! It's quite|different from outside.
{17581}{17671}Oh, and the fire - it's so cheerfuI.
{17686}{17769}I didn't know but that|you might be hungry.
{17788}{17833}Thank you. That's very kind of you.
{17835}{17932}But I'm a bit worried about my Iuggage.|You see, aII your papers were in...
{17934}{18023}I took the Iiberty of having|your Iuggage brought up.
{18025}{18075}AIIow me.
{18090}{18140}Oh, yes.
{18241}{18286}Thanks.
{18998}{19058}(wolf howls)
{19205}{19286}I trust you have kept|your coming here a secret.
{19296}{19364}I've foIIowed your instructions impIicitIy.
{19399}{19451}ExceIIent, Mr RenfieId.
{19472}{19522}ExceIIent.
{19528}{19581}And now, if you're not too fatigued,
{19583}{19674}I wouId Iike to discuss|the Iease on Carfax Abbey.
{19676}{19797}Oh, yes. Everything is in order,|awaiting your signature.

{21299}{21339}Ouch!
{21819}{21929}Oh, it's nothing serious.|Just a smaII cut from that papercIip.
{21963}{22015}It's just a scratch.

{34415}{34465}Obey.
{34599}{34661}- Dr Seward?|- Yes?
{34663}{34709}You're wanted on the teIephone.
{34711}{34768}Oh, thank you. WeII, excuse me, dears...
{34770}{34892}Oh, Father, if it's from home, wiII you say|I'm spending the night in town with Lucy?
{34894}{34951}(chuckles) AII right, dear.
{34953}{34993}- Pardon.|- Yes?
{34996}{35061}I couId not heIp overhearing your name.
{35063}{35169}Might I inquire if you are the Dr Seward|whose sanitarium is at Whitby?
{35171}{35216}Why, yes.
{35218}{35263}I'm Count DracuIa.
{35313}{35428}I have just Ieased Carfax Abbey.|I understand it adjoins your grounds.
{35430}{35525}Why, yes, it does. I'm very happy|to make your acquaintance.
{35544}{35637}May I present my daughter, Mina...
{35664}{35700}Count DracuIa.
{35711}{35806}- Miss Weston...|- How do you do?
{35814}{35901}- And Mr Harker.|- How do you do?
{35929}{35988}Count DracuIa has just|taken Carfax Abbey.
{35990}{36061}Oh, it'II be a reIief to see Iife|in those dismaI oId windows.
{36063}{36162}It wiII indeed. You'II excuse me -|I'm wanted on the teIephone.
{36174}{36216}The abbey couId be very attractive.
{36218}{36311}But I shouId imagine it wouId need|quite extensive repairs.
{36328}{36386}I shaII do very IittIe repairing.
{36424}{36559}It reminds me of the broken battIements|of my own castIe in TransyIvania.
{36571}{36654}The abbey aIways reminds me|of that oId toast:
{36656}{36788}''Above, Iofty timbers,|The waIIs around are bare,
{36814}{36927}Echoing to our Iaughter,|As though the dead were there.''
{36951}{37039}- Nice IittIe sentiment!|- But there's more, even nicer.
{37051}{37161}''Quaff a cup to the dead aIready,|Hurrah for the next to die...''
{37163}{37218}Oh, never mind the rest, dear!
{37247}{37322}To die, to be reaIIy dead...
{37343}{37397}that must be gIorious.
{37413}{37463}Why, Count DracuIa!
{37524}{37654}There are far worse things...|awaiting man...
{37680}{37730}than death.
{38109}{38159}(music box chimes)
{38275}{38384}(Mina, mimicking) It reminds me...|of the broken battIements...
{38386}{38488}of my own castIe in TransyIvania.

{38620}{38720}Laugh aII you Iike. I think he's fascinating.
{38733}{38785}Oh, I suppose he's aII right.
{38809}{38884}But give me someone|a IittIe more normaI.
{38886}{38928}Like John?
{38930}{38986}Yes, dear. Like John.
{39023}{39106}CastIe... DracuIa.
{39142}{39192}TransyIvania.
{39238}{39317}WeII, er... Countess,
{39358}{39441}I'II Ieave you to your count|and his ruined abbey.
{39466}{39532}- Good night, Lucy.|- Good night, dear.
{39583}{39644}The fog seems to be|cIosing down a bit, sir.
{42166}{42204}Another death.
{42206}{42256}Dead?
{42284}{42397}Dr Seward, when did Miss Weston|have the Iast transfusion?
{42399}{42456}About four hours ago.
{42494}{42624}An unnaturaI Ioss of bIood,|which we've been powerIess to check.
{42810}{42935}On the throat of each victim|the same two marks.
{43182}{43273}- (nurse) Keep your hands covered.|- I don't want to keep my hands covered.
{43275}{43326}- But you said you wouId.|- I don't want to.
{43328}{43408}- Now pIease do as you said you wouId.|- I don't want to.
{43410}{43477}(man screams)
{43479}{43556}(patient) He probabIy wants|his fIies again! (manic laughter)

{43776}{43859}- Here, give it to me now, I teII you!|- No, Martin, pIease!
{43861}{43956}No, Martin. Martin, don't!|Don't throw my spider away from me!
{43968}{44043}Oh, Martin... Oh...

{44296}{44371}FIies? FIies?!
{44397}{44453}Poor puny things!
{44486}{44539}Who wants to eat fIies?
{44541}{44587}You do, ya Ioony!
{44618}{44710}Not when I can get nice fat spiders!
{44719}{44809}AII right. Have it your own way.
{45281}{45339}Read, Dummkopf, where I have marked.
{45348}{45500}Deinde cum extractum|vesiculionis sanguine mixtum est,
{45502}{45590}sanguis puniceo color|amisso lactteus fit.
{45661}{45790}GentIemen, we are deaIing|with the... undead.
{45810}{45871}Nosferatu!
{45873}{45998}Yes, Nosferatu. The undead. The vampire.
{46059}{46122}The vampire attacks the throat.
{46137}{46253}It Ieaves two IittIe wounds,|white with red centres.
{46337}{46476}Dr Seward, your patient RenfieId,|whose bIood I have just anaIysed,
{46478}{46617}is obsessed with the idea|that he must devour Iiving things
{46619}{46669}in order to sustain his own Iife.
{46680}{46725}But, Professor Van HeIsing,
{46727}{46823}modern medicaI science|does not admit of such a creature!
{46825}{46883}The vampire is a pure myth, superstition.
{46885}{47068}I may be abIe to bring you proof|that the superstition of yesterday
{47070}{47181}can become the scientific reaIity of today.
{47229}{47352}But, Professor, RenfieId's cravings|have aIways been for small Iiving things.
{47354}{47437}- Nothing human.|- As far as we know, Doctor.
{47455}{47570}But you teII me that he escapes|from his room. He's gone for hours.
{47593}{47643}Where does he go?
{47645}{47701}(voice approaches)
{47712}{47774}..so you won't have to eat fIies.
{47815}{47866}WeII, Mr RenfieId,
{47868}{47962}you are Iooking much better than you did|this morning when I arrived.
{47964}{48021}Thanks. I'm feeIing much better.
{48094}{48141}I am here to heIp you.
{48143}{48203}You understand that, do you not?
{48237}{48312}Why, of course. And I'm very gratefuI.
{48420}{48522}- Keep your fiIthy hands to yourseIf!|- Now now, RenfieId.
{48566}{48711}Oh, Dr Seward, send me away|from this pIace! Send me far away!
{48722}{48794}Why are you so anxious to get away?
{48883}{48977}My cries at night -|they might disturb Miss Mina.
{48979}{49019}Yes?
{49151}{49246}They might give her bad dreams,|Professor Van HeIsing.
{49340}{49388}Bad dreams.

{49679}{49729}(wolf howls)
{49847}{49887}(thud)
{50169}{50217}That sounded Iike a woIf.
{50219}{50324}Yes, it did. But I hardIy think|there are woIves so near London.
{50343}{50393}He thinks they're woIves.
{50395}{50468}Me, I've heard 'em howI at night before.
{50483}{50537}He thinks they're taIking to him!
{50539}{50641}He 'owIs and 'owIs back at 'em.|He's crazy!
{50705}{50800}I might have known. I might have known.
{50851}{50996}We know why the woIves taIk,|do we not, Mr RenfieId?
{51032}{51136}And we know how|we can make them stop.
{51138}{51178}Argh!
{51203}{51259}You know too much to Iive, Van HeIsing!
{51268}{51308}Now now, RenfieId.
{51355}{51428}We wiII get no more out of him now|for a whiIe.
{51430}{51467}Take him away, Martin.
{51469}{51525}On your way, oId fIy-eater.
{51596}{51696}I'm warning you, Dr Seward,|if you don't send me away
{51703}{51783}you must answer|for what wiII happen to Miss Mina!
{51785}{51869}- AII right, Martin.|- Come aIong now. Come aIong.
{51901}{51965}What was that herb that excited him so?
{51990}{52096}WoIfbane. It is a pIant|that grows in centraI Europe.
{52098}{52206}The natives there use it to protect|themseIves against vampires.
{52208}{52287}RenfieId reacted very vioIentIy|to its scent.
{52289}{52428}Seward, I want you to have RenfieId|cIoseIy watched by day and night.
{52430}{52462}EspeciaIIy by night.
{52554}{52604}(sobs)
{52629}{52679}(wolf howls)
{52975}{53025}Yes, master.
{53133}{53191}Master, you've come back.
{53291}{53406}No, master, pIease...|PIease don't ask me to do that.
{53432}{53485}Don't. Not her.
{53568}{53651}PIease! PIease don't, master!
{53674}{53724}Don't, pIease!
{53746}{53786}PIease...
{53811}{53857}Oh, don't...
{54815}{54895}I Iaid in bed for quite a whiIe... reading.
{54934}{55069}And just as I was commencing|to get drowsy, I heard dogs howIing.
{55132}{55191}And when the dream came...
{55201}{55280}it seemed the whoIe room|was fiIIed with mist.
{55295}{55399}It was so thick I couId just|see the Iamp by the bed,
{55425}{55480}a tiny spark in the fog.
{55517}{55613}And then I saw two red eyes|staring at me,
{55631}{55726}and a white, Iivid face|came down out of the mist.
{55783}{55866}It came cIoser... and cIoser.
{55917}{55977}I feIt its breath on my face...
{56006}{56056}and then its Iips!
{56072}{56132}Dear, it was onIy a dream.
{56147}{56219}And then in the morning I feIt so weak.
{56235}{56316}It seemed as if aII the Iife|had been drained out of me.
{56323}{56412}DarIing, we're going to forget|aII about these dreams
{56414}{56495}and think about something cheerfuI,|aren't we?
{56497}{56563}- AIIow me?|- Oh. CertainIy, Professor.
{56590}{56640}Think for a moment.
{56653}{56763}Is there anything that might|have brought this dream on?
{56817}{56841}No.
{56853}{56982}Doctor, there's something troubIing Mina.|Something she won't teII us.
{56988}{57155}And the face in the dream - you say|it seemed to come cIoser and cIoser?
{57188}{57238}The Iips touched you?
{57255}{57303}Where?
{57305}{57368}Is there anything the matter|with your throat?
{57370}{57418}- Oh, no. But I...|- Permit me.
{57420}{57486}- No, pIease...|- Yes. Yes.
{57663}{57725}How Iong have you had|those IittIe marks?
{57727}{57789}- Marks?|- PIease.
{57791}{57891}- Mina, why didn't you Iet us know?|- Do not excite her.
{57951}{58001}When, Miss Mina?
{58063}{58123}Since the morning after the dream.
{58218}{58304}- What couId have caused them?|- (maid) Count DracuIa.
{58447}{58508}It's good to see you back again, Doctor.
{58525}{58580}I heard you have just arrived.
{58711}{58813}And you, Miss Mina,|you're Iooking exceptionaIIy...
{58815}{58878}(Van Helsing) Pardon me, Dr Seward...
{58899}{58968}but I think Miss Mina|shouId go to her room at once.
{58970}{59064}Professor Van HeIsing, I don't beIieve|it's as important as you seem to think.
{59066}{59141}Excuse me. Count DracuIa,|Professor Van HeIsing.
{59270}{59385}Van HeIsing.|A most distinguished scientist,
{59387}{59517}whose name we know...|even in the wiIds of TransyIvania.
{59581}{59659}I had a frightfuI dream a few nights ago.
{59661}{59715}I don't seem to be abIe|to get it out of my mind.
{59717}{59794}I hope you haven't taken|my stories too seriousIy?
{59796}{59836}Stories?
{59864}{59904}Yes.
{59932}{60034}In my humbIe effort|to amuse your fiancee, Mr Harker,
{60036}{60169}I was teIIing her some rather... grim taIes|of my far-off country.
{60195}{60251}I can imagine.
{60253}{60300}Why, John!
{60398}{60497}I can quite understand|Mr Harker's concern.
{60499}{60554}I'm afraid it's quite serious.
{60565}{60641}My dear, I'm sure|Count DracuIa wiII excuse you.
{60643}{60738}You must go to your room,|as Professor Van HeIsing suggests.
{60764}{60843}Oh, but reaIIy, Father,|I'm feeIing quite weII.
{60862}{60934}You had better do as your father advises.
{61014}{61064}Very weII.
{61101}{61141}Good night.
{61157}{61192}John.
{61335}{61443}Miss Mina, may I caII Iater|and inquire how you are feeIing?
{61445}{61517}Why, yes. Thank you.
{61778}{61851}I'm sorry, Doctor,|my visit was so iII-timed.
{61853}{61886}Not at aII.
{61888}{61981}On the contrary, it may prove|to be most enIightening.
{61996}{62089}In fact, before you go,|you can be of definite service.
{62102}{62170}Anything I can do, gIadIy.
{62307}{62439}A moment ago I stumbIed|upon a most amazing phenomenon.
{62460}{62605}Something so incredibIe|I mistrust my own judgment.
{62637}{62677}Look.
{63157}{63229}Dr Seward, my humbIe apoIogy.
{63231}{63291}I disIike mirrors.
{63303}{63369}Van HeIsing wiII expIain.
{63667}{63754}For one who has not Iived|even a singIe Iifetime...
{63779}{63876}you are a wise man, Van HeIsing.
{63969}{64000}Phew!
{64002}{64056}What on earth caused that?
{64058}{64120}Did you see the Iook on his face?|Like a wiId animaI!
{64122}{64180}WiId animaI? Like a madman!
{64243}{64353}What's that, running across the Iawn?|Looks Iike a huge dog!
{64366}{64416}Or a woIf?
{64467}{64513}A woIf?
{64515}{64597}- He was afraid we might foIIow.|- FoIIow?
{64599}{64710}Sometimes they take the form of woIves.|But generaIIy of bats.
{64725}{64777}What are you taIking about?
{64786}{64834}DracuIa.
{64836}{64910}But what's DracuIa got to do|with woIves and bats?
{64912}{64993}- DracuIa is our vampire.|- But sureIy, Professor...
{64995}{65154}A vampire casts no refIection in the gIass.|That is why DracuIa smashed the mirror.
{65167}{65229}I don't mean to be rude,|but that's the sort of thing
{65231}{65283}I'd expect one|of the patients here to say.
{65285}{65418}Yes. And that is what your EngIish|doctors wouId say, your poIice.
{65469}{65583}The strength of the vampire|is that peopIe wiII not beIieve in him.
{66377}{66458}But, Professor, vampires|onIy exist in ghost stories.
{66468}{66591}A vampire, Mr Harker,|is a being that Iives after its death
{66593}{66705}by drinking the bIood of the Iiving.|It must have bIood or it dies.
{66719}{66813}Its power Iasts onIy|from sunset to sunrise.
{66815}{66919}During the hours of the day it must rest|in the earth in which it was buried.
{66921}{67031}But then, if DracuIa were a vampire, he'd|have to return every night to TransyIvania.
{67033}{67064}And that's impossibIe!
{67066}{67134}Then he must have brought|his native soiI with him.
{67136}{67239}Boxes of it. Boxes of earth|Iarge enough for him to rest in.
{67241}{67309}(manic laughter)
{67311}{67339}RenfieId?!
{67341}{67403}What are you doing there? Come here.
{67489}{67541}Did you hear what we were saying?
{67553}{67607}Yes, I heard something.
{67626}{67666}Enough.
{67694}{67754}Be guided by what he says.
{67777}{67829}It's your onIy hope.
{68017}{68072}It's her onIy hope.
{68094}{68151}I begged you to send me away,|but you wouIdn't.
{68153}{68219}Now it's too Iate. It's happened again.
{68221}{68276}(Harker) What's happened?
{68363}{68447}Take her away from here.|Take her away before...
{68449}{68509}(squeaking)
{68575}{68652}No, no, master!|I wasn't going to say anything!
{68668}{68760}I toId them nothing!|I'm IoyaI to you, master!
{68778}{68828}What have you to do with DracuIa?
{68838}{68878}DracuIa?
{69037}{69128}I never even heard the name before.
{69130}{69249}You wiII die in torment if you die|with innocent bIood on your souI.
{69267}{69310}Oh, no.
{69330}{69401}God wiII not damn a Iunatic's souI.
{69425}{69546}He knows that the powers of eviI are|too great for those of us with weak minds.
{69548}{69591}(woman screams)
{69593}{69652}Oh, Mr Harker! Mr Harker, it's horribIe!
{69654}{69761}Oh, it's horribIe! Dr Seward!|Miss Mina... Out there, dead!
{69763}{69823}- Out where?|- Out there!
{69825}{69895}(Renfield laughs)
{70528}{70595}Thank heaven she's aIive.|Thank heaven for that!
{70597}{70696}AIive, yes. But in greater danger,|for she's aIready under his infIuence.
{70698}{70775}Oh, it's horribIe, Van HeIsing, horribIe!|IncredibIe!
{70777}{70886}IncredibIe, perhaps, but we must face it,|we must cope with it.
{70888}{70993}As these attacks continue, she comes|more and more under his power.
{71106}{71158}(child cries)
{71630}{71684}''Further attacks on smaII chiIdren,
{71686}{71829}committed after dark by the mysterious|woman in white, took pIace Iast night.''
{71844}{72039}''Narratives of two smaII girIs, each chiId|describing a 'bootifuI Iady in white'
{72041}{72160}who promised her chocoIates,|enticed her to a secIuded spot,
{72162}{72234}and there bit her sIightIy in the throat.''
{72267}{72341}- Ghosts!|- Vampires.
{72343}{72373}And then, Miss Mina?
{72375}{72430}What couId she know|about the woman in white?
{72432}{72541}- It's bad enough for her to read about it...|- PIease, pIease, Mr Harker.
{72582}{72692}And when was the next time you saw|Miss Lucy after she was buried?
{72879}{72947}I was downstairs on the terrace.
{72993}{73078}She came out of the shadows|and stood Iooking at me.
{73106}{73158}I started to speak to her.
{73236}{73301}And then I remembered she was dead.
{73329}{73419}The most horribIe expression|came over her face.
{73421}{73506}She Iooked Iike a hungry animaI. A woIf.
{73584}{73669}And then she turned|and ran back into the dark.
{73685}{73765}Then you know the woman in white is...
{73856}{73900}Lucy.
{73917}{74058}Miss Mina, I promise you that|after tonight she wiII remain at rest,
{74060}{74129}her souI reIeased from this horror.
{74131}{74243}If you can save Lucy's souI after death,|promise me you'II save mine.
{74245}{74336}DarIing, you're not going to die.|You're going to Iive.
{74350}{74414}No, John. You mustn't touch me.
{74448}{74520}And you mustn't kiss me - ever again.
{74529}{74587}What are you trying to say?
{74655}{74695}You teII him.
{74697}{74767}You make him understand. I can't.
{74933}{74973}Professor...
{75120}{75175}It's aII over, John.
{75177}{75235}Our Iove, our Iife together.
{75280}{75316}Oh, no.
{75318}{75376}No, no, don't Iook at me Iike that.
{75401}{75469}I Iove you, John. You.
{75600}{75675}But this horror... He wiIIs it.
{75677}{75752}(Van Helsing) Miss Mina,|you must come indoors.
{75784}{75834}You must.
{76007}{76095}Do you know what you're doing to her,|Professor? You're driving her crazy!
{76097}{76191}Mr Harker, that is what|you shouId be worrying about.
{76193}{76306}The Iast rays of the day's sun wiII soon be|gone and another night wiII be upon us.
{76308}{76363}(door opens)
{76365}{76474}Dr Seward, I'm taking Mina with me|to London tonight, or I'II caII in the poIice.
{76476}{76554}- But, John...|- Mina, pIease get your bags packed.
{76556}{76633}Seward, I must be master here|or I can do nothing.
{76643}{76670}Quite.
{76672}{76763}Miss Mina, both this room|and your bedroom
{76765}{76819}have been prepared with woIfbane.
{76821}{76880}You wiII be safe if DracuIa returns.
{76882}{76944}She'II be safe aII right,|because she's going with me!
{76946}{77041}- Mina, I'II be waiting for you in the Iibrary.|- Oh, John!
{77058}{77135}Father, taIk to him.|PIease don't Iet him go.
{77208}{77258}Oh, Briggs.
{77295}{77400}Miss Mina is to wear this wreath|of woIfbane when she goes to bed.
{77402}{77492}Watch her cIoseIy and see|that she does not remove it in her sIeep.
{77494}{77516}I understand.
{77518}{77609}And under no circumstances|must these windows be opened tonight.
{77611}{77661}Very weII, sir.
{77932}{77982}(wolf howls)
{78028}{78068}(thud)
{78372}{78471}You wiII recoIIect that DracuIa|cast no refIection in the mirror.
{78473}{78485}Yes.
{78487}{78567}And that three boxes of earth|were deIivered to him at Carfax Abbey.
{78569}{78583}Quite.
{78585}{78693}And, knowing that a vampire|must rest by day in his native soiI,
{78695}{78783}I am convinced that|this DracuIa is no Iegend,
{78785}{78907}but an undead creature whose Iife|has been unnaturaIIy proIonged.
{78909}{79023}(Harker) WeII, Dr Seward, what about it?|Is Mina going with me or not?
{79025}{79110}If you take her from under our protection,|you wiII kiII her.
{79112}{79177}Now, John, pIease, pIease, be patient.
{79186}{79279}Mr Harker, pIease, come here.
{79318}{79360}WeII?
{79362}{79422}John, I know you Iove her.
{79424}{79536}But don't forget she's my daughter,|and I must do what I think is best.
{79572}{79723}Mr Harker, I have devoted my Iifetime|to the study of many strange things -
{79725}{79831}IittIe-known facts which the worId|is perhaps better off for not knowing.
{79833}{79947}I know. But, Professor, aII I want|is to get Mina away from aII of this.
{79949}{79999}That wiII do no good.
{80014}{80089}Our onIy chance of saving Miss Mina's Iife
{80091}{80180}is to find the hiding pIace|of DracuIa's Iiving corpse
{80182}{80241}and to drive a stake through its heart.
{80243}{80362}(Renfield) Isn't this a strange conversation|for men who aren't crazy?
{80364}{80449}RenfieId! You're compeIIing me|to put you in a straitjacket.
{80451}{80556}You forget, Doctor,|that madmen have great strength.
{80572}{80659}Dracula has great strength, eh, RenfieId?
{80661}{80706}Words, words, words!
{80708}{80772}Oh, Martin. Didn't I warn you|to keep a strict watch?
{80774}{80811}What?
{80813}{80860}What, again?!
{80862}{80912}Yes, sir. At once, sir.
{80924}{80981}Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
{81009}{81094}Here, the doctor's pet Ioony|is Ioose again.
{81111}{81208}He came and stood beIow|my window in the moonIight.
{81235}{81303}And he promised me things.
{81328}{81421}Not in words, but by doing them.
{81440}{81482}Doing them?
{81484}{81552}By making them happen.
{81689}{81834}A red mist spread over the Iawn,|coming on Iike a fIame of fire.
{81877}{81931}And then he parted it.
{81975}{82093}And I couId see that|there were thousands of rats,
{82113}{82238}with their eyes bIazing red -|Iike his, onIy smaIIer.
{82271}{82366}And then he heId up his hand|and they aII stopped.
{82404}{82470}And I thought he seemed to be saying...
{82537}{82653}''Rats, rats... rats!''
{82670}{82784}''Thousands... miIIions of them!''
{82802}{82856}''AII red bIood!''
{82868}{82954}''AII these wiII I give you...
{82988}{83046}if you wiII obey me.''
{83064}{83119}What did he want you to do?
{83173}{83245}That which has aIready been done.
{83284}{83373}Strike me down dead, Doctor!|He's got me going!
{83375}{83470}Now he's twisted and broken|them iron bars as if they was cheese.
{83481}{83552}- DracuIa is in the house!|- In the house?!
{83554}{83667}Doctor, this time he can do no harm.|We are ready for him.
{83669}{83770}Martin, come. I'II show you where we can|put Mr RenfieId where he won't escape.
{83772}{83863}Maybe you're right, but I have me doubts.|Come aIong, oId fIy-eater.
{83865}{83990}Now you mustn't get out of it this time.|You've got to stay in your room...
{84014}{84064}Van HeIsing!
{84150}{84227}Now that you have Iearned|what you have Iearned,
{84229}{84316}it wouId be weII for you|to return to your own country.
{84318}{84468}I prefer to remain, and protect|those whom you wouId destroy.
{84483}{84540}You are too Iate.
{84542}{84617}My bIood now fIows through her veins.
{84683}{84769}She wiII Iive through|the centuries to come...
{84800}{84844}as I have Iived.
{84852}{84921}ShouId you escape us, DracuIa,
{84923}{85021}we know how to save Miss Mina's souI,|if not her Iife.
{85027}{85081}If she dies by day.
{85089}{85171}But I shaII see that she dies by night.
{85173}{85296}And I wiII have Carfax Abbey|torn down stone by stone,
{85298}{85354}excavated a miIe around.
{85356}{85466}I wiII find your earth box|and drive that stake through your heart.
{85500}{85550}Come here.
{85941}{85981}Come...
{86009}{86049}here.
{86821}{86906}Your wiII is strong,
{86916}{86966}Van HeIsing.
{87102}{87176}More woIfbane?
{87187}{87250}More effective than woIfbane, Count.
{87268}{87314}Indeed?
{87316}{87356}(snarls)
{87511}{87557}(Mina) Open the windows, Briggs,|Iet in some air!
{87559}{87671}The odour in the room from that horribIe|weed! It's stifIing! I can't stand it!
{87673}{87752}- But the professor gave orders.|- Never mind the professor now.
{87754}{87852}Now, pIease, go back to bed at once.|I'm going to caII your father.
{87880}{87918}What is it, Briggs?
{87920}{87970}I don't know, Mr Harker.
{87981}{88039}I feIt strangeIy dizzy.
{88041}{88134}And when it cIeared away, Miss Mina was|up and dressed and out on the terrace.
{88136}{88230}- And I can't get her to go to bed.|- WeII, Iet me see her. TeII her I'm here.
{88232}{88271}John?
{88273}{88342}Oh, John, I'm so gIad you're here.
{88344}{88405}What have they been doing to me, dear?
{88451}{88564}Locking me in my room! Oh, and|the horribIe smeII of that awfuI weed.
{88566}{88620}It's been Iike a nightmare.
{88634}{88696}What's been the matter?
{88698}{88755}Why are you Iooking at me Iike that?
{88766}{88805}Mina...
{88817}{88902}You're so... Iike a changed girI.
{88927}{88972}Oh, you Iook wonderfuI!
{88974}{89075}I feel wonderfuI.|I've never feIt better in my Iife.
{89077}{89189}I'm so gIad to see you Iike this.|I've been awfuIIy worried about you.
{89191}{89281}Mr Harker, you'd better|bring Miss Mina inside.
{89292}{89350}That's aII right, Briggs - now that I'm here.
{89352}{89408}Run aIong, Briggs. Don't worry.
{89530}{89595}John... Look, the fog's Iifting.
{89614}{89670}See how pIain you can see the stars.
{89680}{89722}Yes.
{89724}{89772}MiIIions of them.
{89774}{89837}I've never seen them so cIose.
{89839}{89919}Why, it Iooks as if you couId|reach out and touch them.
{89932}{89987}WouId you Iike me to get you a ha...
{90024}{90082}Why, what's the matter?
{90084}{90145}Oh, nothing. Nothing at aII.
{90204}{90264}Come. Let's sit down.
{90348}{90388}Van HeIsing.
{90390}{90488}Seward. That which I feared|from the beginning has happened.
{90490}{90517}What?
{90519}{90615}DracuIa boasts that he has fused|his bIood with that of Miss Mina.
{90617}{90698}In Iife she wiII now become|the fouI thing of the night that he is.
{90700}{90747}- But Van HeIsing...|- Come, Seward.
{90749}{90798}There's not a moment to be Iost.
{90800}{90898}Oh, but I Iove the fog!|I Iove nights with fog.
{90913}{90999}WeII, onIy yesterday you said|you were afraid of the night.
{91001}{91111}But, darIing, I couId never have said|anything so siIIy! I couIdn't!
{91113}{91221}I Iove the night.|Why, it's the onIy time I feeI reaIIy aIive.
{91239}{91316}- There's that bat again!|- (bat squeaks)
{91336}{91374}- Yes?|- Shoo!
{91376}{91431}- Look out. He'II get in your hair.|- (squeaking)
{91433}{91470}Yes?
{91543}{91601}- My, that was a big bat.|- (squeaking)
{91603}{91653}I wiII.
{91706}{91762}You wiII what?
{91764}{91816}Why, I didn't say anything.
{91818}{91863}Yes, you did. You said ''I wiII''.
{91865}{91910}Oh, no, I didn't.
{91912}{91977}John... Come, sit down.
