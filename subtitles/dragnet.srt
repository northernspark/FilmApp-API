Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:21,563
This is the city.
Los Angeles, California.

3
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:26,860
465 square miles of constantly
interfacing humanity...

4
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:30,280
representing every race, colour...

5
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:33,659
creed and persuasion...

6
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:39,122
that God,
no matter how he is worshipped...

7
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:42,543
chose, in His infinite wisdom,
to deposit here...

8
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:45,879
in the cultural nexus
of the Pacific Rim.

9
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:48,882
Almost 4 million people
work and play here.

10
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:52,135
And like any other place
anywhere...

11
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:56,098
there are those who have it
and those who want it.

12
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:59,560
Those who have it, enjoy it...

13
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:01,520
no matter how they got it.

14
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:05,023
Those who want it, can get it
by attempting to better themselves...

15
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:08,819
in a sympathetic community populated
by decent citizens cheering them on.

16
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:13,699
Or they can try to take it
the easy way.

17
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:18,745
Because even in the City of Angels,
from time to time, some halos slip.

18
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:25,210
That's where I come in, doing my job to
the best of my ability on a daily basis.

19
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:29,798
I work here.
I carry a badge.

Dragnet, Dragnet, Dragnet

00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:12,419
Ladies and gentlemen, the story
you are about to see is true.

45
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:15,422
The names have been changed
to protect the innocent.

46
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:20,636
For example, George Baker
is now called Sylvia Wiss.

47
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,535
Hey, who called
the fire department?

48
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,412
What the hell is going on here?

49
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,456
Chief, where's the fire?

50
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,889
See the fire?

51
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:09,685
I see the fire.
I see the fire.

52
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,437
Good! When you wake up...

53
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:18,610
tell Jerry Caesar
he's out of business.

54
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,498
It was Wednesday, January 7.

55
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:35,460
A cool day in Los Angeles,
with westerly winds...

56
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:38,172
and light, scattered clouds
at 3,000 feet.

57
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,299
I was working day watch
out of Robbery-Homicide...

58
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,509
at the same desk
my late Uncle Joe occupied...

59
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:45,387
when he served with the department
20 years ago.

60
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:53,812
Many aspects of the officer's routine
have changed since Uncle Joe's time.

61
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:56,982
Now there are new methods,
new philosophies, new equipment.

62
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:00,068
The standard service revolver
and simple lead sap...

63
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:03,614
have given way to Taser guns
and anodized metal batons.

64
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:07,326
But there's one thing
that never changes.

65
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:12,372
The face of crime. It just gets bigger
and badder and uglier every day.

66
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:15,584
My partner's name is Frank Smith.
The boss is Captain Gannon.

67
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,085
My name's Friday.

68
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:19,046
- Joe.
- Captain.

69
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:22,049
Frank's late.
Must've been held up in traffic.

70
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:25,511
- Frank won't be coming in today.
- 24-hour virus?

71
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:28,430
- Or tomorrow.
- Forty-eight?

72
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:31,225
Frank quit.
Bought a goat farm.

73
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:34,186
Moved to Ukiah. Left you this note.

74
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,980
He was too broken up to talk about it.

75
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,358
Said he knew you'd understand.

76
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,238
Every man has a dream to chase.
Frank's was that goat farm.

77
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:47,658
- I understand. But tell me something.
- Yeah?

78
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:51,703
Those 3.6 million citizens who expected
him to be on the job this morning...

79
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:53,372
will they understand?

80
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,170
8:47 a.m.

81
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:04,466
Captain Gannon had assigned me
to investigate the Pagan robberies...

82
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:07,761
a pattern of serial crimes
which had occurred throughout the city.

83
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:11,223
They'd seemed merely irritating,
but were gaining notoriety...

84
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,517
through their growing frequency
and naked brazenness.

85
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,770
I was to contact my new partner
at the central receiving lot.

86
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:21,441
A less experienced officer might have
been concerned he was getting potluck.

87
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:24,862
But I knew that any detective
the department had to offer me...

88
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,906
was automatically worthy
of my respect.

89
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,453
- Sergeant Friday?
- Who wants to know?

90
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:36,331
I'm Pep Streebek,
your new partner.

91
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:40,669
- Not looking like that, you aren't.
- Really? What's that mean?

92
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,797
It means I don't care what
undercover rock you crawled out from...

93
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:46,258
there's a dress code for detectives
in Robbery-Homicide.

94
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,968
Section 3-605...

95
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:52,639
.10, .20, .22, .24, .26,
.50, .70, .80.

96
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:56,185
It specifies clean shirt, short hair,
tie, pressed trousers...

97
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:59,730
sports jacket or suit and leather shoes,
preferable with a high shine.

98
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,403
9:05 a.m.

99
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,156
Streebek's unauthorized outfit
and facial growth were history.

100
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:14,161
For the first time in 12 years, I rolled
into traffic with a new partner.

101
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:26,590
Detective Pep Streebek:
Male, Caucasian...

102
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,926
six feet, 165 pounds...

103
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,094
no distinguishing scars.

104
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:34,640
He had an extensive list
of merit citations which was tainted...

105
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,975
by his total disregard
for departmental procedure.

106
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,811
He pictured himself
as some hipster, free-bird cop.

107
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:41,813
But his wings were about
to be clipped...

108
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:45,275
because now he was going to play
the detective game by my rules.

109
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,499
Friday, we're allowed to go 55.

110
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,836
On some occasions, even faster.

111
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,548
I'm well aware of the
federally-mandated speed limit.

112
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:10,634
But did it ever occur to you
that by going 8 miles an hour slower...

113
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:15,472
we might save gas and ease the burden
on the taxpayers who pay our salaries?

114
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:18,517
A little extra gas
isn't gonna put the city in hock.

115
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,519
Besides, this looks bad.

116
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:24,898
Live a little!
It's the vertical pedal on the right.

117
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:28,193
9:47 a.m.
We arrived at the Griffith Park Zoo...

118
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:33,073
Los Angeles's habitat for wild animals
sustained in dignified captivity.

119
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:37,077
An adult male lion and a security guard
had been tranquillized with a dart gun...

120
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,454
and subsequent robberies
had occurred.

121
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:41,456
These animals have it pretty good.

122
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,042
Simulated surroundings,
three squares a day.

123
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:47,963
If these creatures could talk, they'd
give the citizens a vote of thanks.

124
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:51,508
Friday, these animals...

125
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:56,221
were trapped, stunned and roped,
crated and shipped, dropped into cages.

126
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:59,933
You think they were in the wild
forming lines, jockeying for position...

127
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:03,228
saying, "Take me!
I want to live on damn cement"?

128
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:06,315
When I look in their eyes,
I get a different message.

129
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,525
We'll leave it at that.

130
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,573
Are you the police?

131
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:18,076
Friday, Streebek. Robbery.
You have some Pagan cards?

132
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,580
Yeah. Three of them.
Left in separate cages.

133
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:24,541
Let me show you where I found them.

134
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,252
This is Ben, our boa constrictor.

135
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:31,465
The missing giant anaconda was still
here last night at 8:30.

136
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:34,009
I know because that's when it gets
its final feeding.

137
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,345
It's not always its final feeding.

138
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:39,431
Sometimes it hides a little snack
for later.

139
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:41,558
Just the facts,
if you don't mind, ma'am.

140
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:44,228
What exactly does a Central Bolivian
Anaconda choose to feed on?

141
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,647
It eats whole, live groundhogs.

142
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,275
- You skip breakfast, Friday?
- Whoever stole it's gotta feed it.

143
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:53,612
We also seem to be missing
one of these.

144
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,575
What is the approximate dry weight
of the Madagascar Fruit Tree Bat?

145
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:01,036
You mean you don't know?

146
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:06,667
This is the one
I understand the least.

147
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:15,133
Somebody must've wanted that lion's mane
bad to pull a stunt like that.

148
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:19,638
Although, as Mohawks go,
it's not that bad. It'll grow back.

149
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:24,142
How do you tell that to kids who haven't
seen a lion and won't want to again?

150
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:26,395
Kids, it'll grow back.

151
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:28,856
Yea!

152
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,650
10:35 a.m.

153
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:34,778
Arsonists posing as firemen
had left a Pagan card...

154
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:37,155
in the charred ruins
of a downtown warehouse.

155
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:40,158
We were advised to contact
the owner of the stolen merchandise...

156
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:42,619
soft-core porno lord, Jerry Caesar...

157
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:46,665
at his notorious pleasure compound
in the coveted Bel-Air section.

158
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:54,673
Oh, thank God! Vibrator repair?

159
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:59,178
No, ma'am.
Los Angeles Police Department.

160
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:00,971
Sorry.

161
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:12,232
It's enough to churn your guts,
isn't it?

162
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:15,277
This girl pruning this bush
with her...

163
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,780
That a slut peddler like Jerry Caesar
could build a modern day Gomorrah...

164
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:22,284
in the same city where they recorded
"We Are the World."

165
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,044
- Hi.
- Hi.

166
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:34,713
Don't get too friendly.

167
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,677
Hi. Can I help you?

168
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:44,306
Police officers, ma'am.
L.A.P.D. Robbery. I'm Friday. This is...

169
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,725
- April!
- That's right.

170
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:48,644
She was a Baitmate.

171
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:51,063
Bait magazine.
She was featured.

172
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:53,524
I get the hang of it.
In the April issue.

173
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:57,486
No, Mr Silly. February!
My name is April.

174
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:02,074
Don't tell me. Your favourite movies are
The Sound of Music and Yes, Giorgio.

175
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:04,159
You love to go bobbing for apples.

176
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:06,620
Your major turn-offs are...

177
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:10,749
anchovies, people
who don't use coasters and...

178
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:14,628
And men who smoke in public places.

179
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:17,840
Let's go meet Jerry.

180
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,561
There's Jerry over there.

181
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:41,989
I'm gonna have a place
like this someday.

182
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:44,324
Dream on, Streebek, dream on.

183
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:53,333
It's about time.

184
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:55,627
I called you cops three hours ago.

185
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:58,714
Yes, sir. My name's Friday.
This is Detective Streebek.

186
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:00,966
What's missing?

187
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,552
How about the entire run...

188
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:07,472
every single copy of our
25th Anniversary double issue of Bait.

189
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:11,143
- Bait.
- That's his skin magazine.

190
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:15,230
You say.
The intelligent subscriber regards it...

191
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:18,233
as a politically-oriented,
socially-impacted monthly.

192
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:22,070
I'm not gonna allow a gang
of cement heads to intimidate me...

193
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:24,448
just because I refused to publish
their stupid manifesto.

194
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:29,036
- Tell us about that.
- Here. Read it for yourself.

195
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:33,123
"Manifest of the International
Brotherhood of Pagan.

196
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:37,169
We believe bad sex and good drugs are
the cornerstone of a great democracy.

197
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:40,714
- The peak of pornography..."
- We get the general idea.

198
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:44,801
My publishing company is not a
private platform for a bunch of yahoos.

199
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:47,387
I don't care how many copies
they buy.

200
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:51,183
I don't have to publish their junk just
because they got 1st amendment rights.

201
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:53,477
I've got 1st amendment rights, too.
Look 'em up.

202
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,146
I don't have.
I can quote 'em to you.

203
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,775
Anyhow, how much do you figure
a monthly run of your...

204
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:01,818
"magazine" is worth?

205
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:07,616
It's more money than you'll ever see
in your life. And I do that every month.

206
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,159
My money's clean.

207
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:13,539
I'll tell you what you do before you go
home and start polishing your pennies.

208
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:16,875
Go out and get my magazines
back on the stand where they belong.

209
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,797
Listen, hotshot, I don't care for you or
the putrid sludge you're trowelling out.

210
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,468
But until the laws are changed,
my job's to get back your boxes of smut.

211
00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:28,971
Since I'll be doing it holding my nose,
I'll be doing it with one hand.

212
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:34,434
Excuse me. Jerry, it's time
for your collagen treatment.

213
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:37,563
And don't forget, you're having
your pores sucked at 3:00.

214
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:40,190
Thank you, Sylvia.

215
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:42,734
Boys, as you can see,
I've got my work to do.

216
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:46,029
Why don't you get the hell out of here
and do yours?

217
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,746
You have very strong hands.

218
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,124
Hey, Sylvia Wiss!

219
00:15:58,542 --> 00:15:59,918
Yes, that's me.

220
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:02,880
They oughta transfer you to
Missing Persons. You know everybody.

221
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:07,968
Don't you read the papers? Saturday is
Bait magazine's 25th anniversary party.

222
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:11,263
Caesar is reuniting all
of his former Baitmates.

223
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:16,476
Miss Sylvia Wiss, right here,
was the very first Baitmate ever.

224
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,978
Fascinating.

225
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:22,900
Sergeant, if I asked your honest opinion
about something, would I get it?

226
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,943
You can bet the house on it.

227
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,906
Would you say these look like
the breasts of a 43-year-old woman?

228
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:35,621
No. No, they don't, Miss Wiss.

229
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:39,124
They're quite impressive,
bordering on spectacular.

230
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,126
We have to be running along now.

231
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,629
What's your hurry?

232
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:46,340
Wouldn't you like to have
an early lunch?

233
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:50,052
Listen, Joe,
it's the darndest thing.

234
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:53,639
I seem to have
left my notebook in the car.

235
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:57,601
It's gonna take me 15, 20 min...
A half an hour to find it.

236
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:02,481
Why don't you pump Sylvia privately
for information?

237
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:04,608
And I'll, you know...

238
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:08,487
- Nice meeting you, Miss Wiss.
- I had a good time, too.

239
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:12,157
Come on. Let's go to the car
and find that notebook.

240
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:15,494
Are you crazy?

241
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:17,496
Sylvia Wiss wanted you.

242
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:20,707
Let me tell you something.

243
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:24,169
There are two things which differentiate
the human species from animals.

244
00:17:24,253 --> 00:17:28,006
One, we use cutlery.
Two, we can control our sexual urges.

245
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:32,594
You might be an exception, but don't
drag me into your private hell.

246
00:17:34,513 --> 00:17:37,432
You've got a lot
of repressed feelings, don't you?

247
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:40,394
Must be what keeps your hair up.

248
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:54,950
- What is bothering you besides me?
- I'm thinking about those Pagans.

249
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:59,121
If all they were after was revenge
against Caesar, it's slime versus slime.

250
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:03,917
But when they attack great institutions
like our city zoo, my hackles turn red.

251
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:07,379
You'll lose those red hackles
if you eat those chili dogs.

252
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:09,047
I can handle it.

253
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:12,926
They're the worst thing for you.
Filled with nitrates, toxins, poisons.

254
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,928
And you're doubling up on them.

255
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:18,932
Mister, outside of cigarettes
I only have one vice: Chili dogs.

256
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:21,977
So pipe down and let me
enjoy my lunch in peace.

257
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,689
Do you know the things that can fall
into an industrial sausage press...

258
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:29,359
not excluding rodent hairs
and bug excrement?

259
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:31,528
I hate you, Streebek.

260
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:45,375
Except for you and canned cling peaches,
I'd be hard-pressed to find anyone...

261
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:48,170
that doesn't know you should never leave
your car keys in the ignition.

262
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:51,548
It's called a mistake. But I don't
suppose you ever make any of those.

263
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:54,009
At ease, Streebek.
We got another one.

264
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:56,553
Chemical train hijack
at the freight yards.

265
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:59,181
Damn Pagans must be living on No-Doz.

266
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:01,600
Yes, sir. We'll roll
as soon as we requisition a new...

267
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:05,103
One more thing.
Police and fire departments...

268
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:09,107
have been reporting vehicles stolen,
so keep an eye on your car.

269
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:18,200
1:15 p.m. After requisitioning
a replacement vehicle...

270
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:20,911
we were issued
a new Ford Escort subcompact...

271
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:25,999
and responded to the call at Southern
California's largest railhead...

272
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:29,795
with more than 1,000 miles of track
lying parallel over 2 million ties...

273
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:31,839
hewn from majestic redwood forests.

274
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,677
3,000 gallons of two deadly chemicals
had been siphoned individually...

275
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,805
from their respective
hijacked tanker cars.

276
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:43,308
We questioned the battered
train engineer, Seńor Tito Provencal...

277
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:46,979
and attempted to determine the precise
identification of the missing gases...

278
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:50,774
from the owner of the
chemicals company, a Mr Roy Grest.

279
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:55,821
Actually trichlornitromethan
and the pseudo-halogenic cyanogen.

280
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:57,948
Pseudo-halogenic cyanogen.

281
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:01,702
They're shipped in separate containers.
Mixed properly in the exact ratio...

282
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:05,080
they form a liquid fertilizer
that's clear as water.

283
00:20:05,164 --> 00:20:07,499
- But you wouldn't want to smell it.
- Why is that?

284
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,878
It burns the eyes, lungs, and throat,
causes vomiting...

285
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:13,255
and if continuously inhaled, death.

286
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:15,799
Sort of like your aftershave.

287
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:30,772
It's time to "Advance"
with the Reverend Jonathan Whirley...

288
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:35,194
founder of MAMA,
the Moral Advance Movement of America.

289
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:40,324
Today, Dr Whirley's special guest is
police commissioner for Los Angeles...

290
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,951
Ms. Jane Kirkpatrick.

291
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:45,579
Dr Whirley.

292
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:50,042
Thank you, George,
and welcome once again to Advance.

293
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:52,419
Commissioner...

294
00:20:52,503 --> 00:20:55,088
Please, will you call me Jane?

295
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:59,051
Only if you call me Jonathan.

296
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:02,054
Have you seen this guy?
What a mental fur ball.

297
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:04,556
Happens to be one of my favourite shows.

298
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,600
Why don't you listen and learn?

299
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:11,688
What a deep honour it is for this city
that you have chosen Los Angeles...

300
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:16,193
to be the new focal point for
the Moral Advance Movement of America.

301
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:20,405
It's quite simple, Jane.

302
00:21:20,489 --> 00:21:23,659
If one wishes to effect a financial
upheaval in this country...

303
00:21:23,742 --> 00:21:26,245
one should set his or her sights
on Wall Street.

304
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:30,040
If one wishes to revolutionize
the political system...

305
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:33,126
he or she would naturally
go to Washington.

306
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:36,797
But when dealing...

307
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,133
with pornography, filth, crime...

308
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:42,386
degradation...

309
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:46,056
what better place is there to begin with
than Los Angeles...

310
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:49,643
the current capital of depravity...

311
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:53,397
in what sadly passes
for the modern world.

312
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,825
2:15 p.m.

313
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:09,538
We had been advised to follow up on
a theft at 8823467 Magnolia Boulevard.

314
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:11,915
At this time of day,
it took us 20 minutes to get there.

315
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:14,001
The complainant was the landlady,
Enid Borden.

316
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:16,170
Some Pagan cards had been found.

317
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:24,136
- What the hell do you want?
- Police officers, ma'am.

318
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:26,305
About time you pencil dicks showed up.

319
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:28,849
Why couldn't you have gotten here
before that big, bad...

320
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:32,436
stupid-looking piece of sewage breath
stole my wedding dress?

321
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:35,189
Sewage breath would be
your nickname for...

322
00:22:35,272 --> 00:22:36,815
Muzz. Emil Muzz.

323
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:39,193
Not much of an improvement.

324
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:44,656
That ass-wipe also stiffed me for two
months' rent when his cheque bounced.

325
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,909
Goddam puss-faced pimp stick.

326
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:49,286
All that was left in his room...

327
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:51,663
was a big box of these things.

328
00:22:56,502 --> 00:22:59,755
Any idea where Emil Muzz could be now?
Friends? Family?

329
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:03,342
He was a loner.
Took off in the middle of the night.

330
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:05,552
Useless scum-lapping shitbag.

331
00:23:05,636 --> 00:23:07,846
Just the facts, ma'am.
He leave anything else behind?

332
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:11,725
Yeah, a tape deck which I had to sell
to make up for the lost rent.

333
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:15,812
So there's nothing you can do about it,
you slimy little jizz bucket.

334
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:20,108
Yes, ma'am. Although you could be cited
for swearing at us.

335
00:23:20,192 --> 00:23:22,194
Says who, flathead?

336
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:26,240
The California penal code 314.1
covering obscene conduct in public.

337
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:27,741
Good enough for you?

338
00:23:27,825 --> 00:23:31,370
Them magazines and papers
were his down in the trash.

339
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:33,455
No cheques or money. I looked.

340
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:35,874
I should've thrown it in the river
the day he left...

341
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:39,378
but unlike some people,
I have a heart, goddam it!

342
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:41,797
That miserable bag of puke.

343
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:47,678
I think we're finished here,
don't you, Detective Streebek?

344
00:23:49,638 --> 00:23:52,850
Didn't she say she threw
some of his stuff in the trash?

345
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:55,894
There it goes. Let's roll.

346
00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:13,078
Am I glad I got transferred
into Robbery-Homicide!

347
00:24:13,162 --> 00:24:16,665
You can almost reach out
and touch the tension.

348
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:19,501
What the hell was that?

349
00:24:19,585 --> 00:24:21,503
It has its days.

350
00:24:21,587 --> 00:24:23,755
Yeah. Like today.

351
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:28,552
Sitting in a park, getting eaten
by ducks, sifting through garbage.

352
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:32,472
Hello! Photographs of people.
Kinda faded.

353
00:24:32,556 --> 00:24:35,851
- Maybe one of them's Muzz.
- We couldn't be that lucky.

354
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:41,732
Hey, phone number.
Think it means something?

355
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:45,277
There's only one way to find out,
isn't there?

356
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:53,160
It's for you. The president.

357
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,051
It's ringing.

358
00:25:12,888 --> 00:25:15,849
- Good afternoon. Caesar residence.
- Bingo.

359
00:25:15,933 --> 00:25:18,602
- Hello. May I help you?
- Emil Muzz, please.

360
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:22,147
- He's not here right now.
- This is Sergeant Friday, L.A.P.D.

361
00:25:22,231 --> 00:25:24,274
Could you tell us where he is?

362
00:25:24,358 --> 00:25:27,069
He's Mr Caesar's driver...

363
00:25:27,152 --> 00:25:31,406
and Mr Caesar's sailing on his yacht.

364
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,659
That's it.
The limousine from the mansion.

365
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:35,536
Yeah, and Emil Muzz.

366
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:38,205
Let's check Enid Borden's description.

367
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:40,082
Well...

368
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:42,417
"Big, bad, stupid-looking."

369
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:44,169
An exact match.

370
00:25:57,975 --> 00:26:00,060
Police officers. Emil Muzz?

371
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:06,859
We need to ask you
a few questions.

372
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:08,902
Blow it out your pants, cop.

373
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:12,030
Good, Muzz.
Give yourself a hard time.

374
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:21,874
I'll drive!

375
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:47,191
- What are you doing?
- Calling for backup.

376
00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:50,194
- Why?
- There are regulations for pursuit.

377
00:26:50,277 --> 00:26:53,906
- We're gonna follow every one of them.
- Forget it. This is our collar.

378
00:26:53,989 --> 00:26:56,033
- Our collar, huh?
- I think so.

379
00:26:56,116 --> 00:26:58,368
Let me tell you something,
Mr Lone Wolf.

380
00:26:58,452 --> 00:27:02,206
The dedicated people of the Los Angeles
Police Department are one big family...

381
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:05,000
from my brother, the traffic cop,
to my sister, the metre maid.

382
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:08,712
And when one of us makes a collar,
we all make a collar.

383
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:12,341
Are you on any medication that as
your partner I should be made aware of?

384
00:27:12,424 --> 00:27:15,636
2-King-14.
I am requesting a backup...

385
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,976
Oh, no! Ahh!

386
00:27:38,534 --> 00:27:39,660
Look out!

387
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:55,926
Look out! Muppets.

388
00:28:15,362 --> 00:28:20,242
Reckless endangerment of human life,
wilful disregard of private property...

389
00:28:20,325 --> 00:28:23,996
- He's really racking up the violations.
- Not him, you!

390
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:27,624
Your ticket back to civilian life, Mr
I-Like-To-Throw-The-Book-Out-The-Window.

391
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:29,418
That's a good idea.

392
00:28:36,884 --> 00:28:38,719
Ever been to Hawaii?

393
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,232
Look out!

394
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:01,992
Surf's up, but not for you.

395
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:05,370
You'll be hanging 10 downtown.
Read him his rights.

396
00:29:05,454 --> 00:29:07,539
Emil Muzz, guess what!

397
00:29:07,623 --> 00:29:09,708
You are under arrest!

398
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:14,963
Sit down, unless you're growing!

399
00:29:15,047 --> 00:29:18,091
We've got you on
'87 motre vehicle violations.

400
00:29:18,175 --> 00:29:20,928
It's only time before we tie you in
to one of those Pagan jobs.

401
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:23,138
And you stole
your landlady's wedding dress...

402
00:29:23,222 --> 00:29:26,600
which is the only endearing thing
about you, so talk to us.

403
00:29:29,186 --> 00:29:31,980
Listen, you public pawn.
My attorney's on his way.

404
00:29:32,064 --> 00:29:35,275
We both know I'll be out
on bail.

405
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:37,653
So take off these cuffs
and open the door!

406
00:29:37,736 --> 00:29:42,908
I wouldn't worry about the door. Scum
who'd represent you would ooze under it.

407
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:46,787
Joe, why don't you go get
a couple cups of coffee?

408
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:49,623
I could use one.
You want anything?

409
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:53,544
Chewing gum, Snickers bar,
and my attorney, badge kisser!

410
00:30:09,643 --> 00:30:11,311
Well, Emil.

411
00:30:12,938 --> 00:30:15,107
It's just you...

412
00:30:16,233 --> 00:30:18,443
and me...

413
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:20,487
and your balls...

414
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:22,781
and this drawer.

415
00:30:39,923 --> 00:30:41,592
4:15 p.m.

416
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:46,180
By the time I had returned with coffee,
Muzz was singing like Beverly Sills.

417
00:30:46,263 --> 00:30:49,349
He had been planning to attend a meeting
that night at the Pagan clubhouse...

418
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:52,686
but he refused to divulge the time
or location of that meeting.

419
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:55,105
Muzz, let's run through it again.

420
00:30:55,189 --> 00:30:58,942
You say you're a Pagan, but you work for
Jerry Caesar. That makes you a plant.

421
00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:01,653
Make it easy on yourself.
Lead us to the stolen magazines.

422
00:31:01,737 --> 00:31:03,906
Jump on this and spin, cop.

423
00:31:03,989 --> 00:31:07,159
I'm not saying another word
until my attorney gets here!

424
00:31:07,242 --> 00:31:08,494
Joe...

425
00:31:08,577 --> 00:31:13,040
wouldn't a couple of Danishes
go good with this coffee?

426
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:25,594
At 7:13 p.m., Captain Gannon authorized
us to stake out Muzz's clubhouse...

427
00:31:25,677 --> 00:31:28,889
located in the ecologically-balanced
San Gabriel Mountains.

428
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:32,059
When a code-5 authorization for
undercover surveillance is approved...

429
00:31:32,142 --> 00:31:36,063
officers proceed to the building
where the department has research...

430
00:31:36,146 --> 00:31:40,984
on the precise behaviour and dress
of today's average street gang member.

431
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:50,118
Friday, I think we finally found
your look.

432
00:31:50,202 --> 00:31:51,787
9:56 p.m.

433
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:55,123
We were issued appropriate apparel
and withdrew from receiving...

434
00:31:55,207 --> 00:31:59,044
one distressed
1985 unmarked Ford sedan.

435
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:03,173
It's right up here, off highway 61!

436
00:32:03,257 --> 00:32:05,551
Yeah. Probably some
rat-hole roadhouse...

437
00:32:05,634 --> 00:32:09,096
where they watch TV
and suck beers all day.

438
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:16,353
Uh-oh. Highway patrol.
And they're pulling us over.

439
00:32:32,286 --> 00:32:35,330
- Licence and registration.
- What was the offence?

440
00:32:35,414 --> 00:32:38,000
- It's okay. They're Pagans.
- Yeah?

441
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:42,254
Yeah. Show 'em your card, Muzz, Emil.

442
00:32:42,337 --> 00:32:44,965
Yeah, that's right. That's me.

443
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:47,384
Muzz, Emil. Emil Muzz.

444
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:49,845
I've been sick.

445
00:32:49,928 --> 00:32:53,599
Sorry to bother you, fellas.
We can't be too careful, huh?

446
00:32:53,682 --> 00:32:56,059
We don't want any non-Pagans
around here.

447
00:32:56,143 --> 00:32:58,729
Especially tonight, right? Huh?

448
00:33:10,532 --> 00:33:13,577
Follow us, fellas.
The party's just starting!

449
00:33:20,626 --> 00:33:22,169
Bogus cops!

450
00:33:22,252 --> 00:33:25,756
No matter how many times I see that,
it never ceases to disgust me.

451
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:29,510
People dressing up in strange clothes
pretending to be who they're not?

452
00:33:29,593 --> 00:33:32,262
Exactly! That kind of behaviour...

453
00:33:32,346 --> 00:33:34,556
Just get out that list
of stolen black and whites.

454
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:42,272
9-9-9-4-7-4.
Oh, yeah, it's hot, all right.

455
00:33:42,356 --> 00:33:43,607
Yeah.

456
00:33:56,745 --> 00:33:59,206
Howdy. I'm Emil Muzz,
and I'm a Pagan.

457
00:34:14,805 --> 00:34:17,349
Good evening, Pagans.

458
00:34:17,432 --> 00:34:19,893
Don't forget your goat leggings.

459
00:34:33,323 --> 00:34:35,659
Must be every other stolen
police vehicle on our hot sheet.

460
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:37,953
We're onto something here.

461
00:34:38,036 --> 00:34:40,164
You think so?

462
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:45,502
- I see school is out.
- Yeah.

463
00:34:45,586 --> 00:34:49,590
All I can think of is 38 kids standing
individually on lonely corners...

464
00:34:49,673 --> 00:34:51,967
waiting for a bus
that will never come.

465
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:55,137
Put your goat leggings on
and try to blend in.

466
00:35:07,524 --> 00:35:10,194
- Put it to sleep.
- Down, boys.

467
00:35:14,364 --> 00:35:17,659
You have to admire their techniques
in crowd control.

468
00:35:17,743 --> 00:35:22,039
Yeah. Cosy little group.
Just like your local Rotarians.

469
00:35:22,122 --> 00:35:26,502
Listen, we get a little wild
at times, sure...

470
00:35:26,585 --> 00:35:28,921
but nothing like this.

471
00:35:42,142 --> 00:35:47,272
I'd say this is shaping up to be a
little more than a series of robberies.

472
00:35:47,356 --> 00:35:51,610
"People against goodness and normalcy."

473
00:35:51,693 --> 00:35:53,946
P-A-G-A-N.

474
00:35:54,029 --> 00:35:55,656
Pagan.

475
00:35:55,739 --> 00:35:57,324
Nice work, Joe.

476
00:35:57,407 --> 00:36:02,663
Ah, here are two who have not yet
sipped the nectar of Shaitan.

477
00:36:10,379 --> 00:36:14,842
Small surprise before
the ceremony starts?

478
00:36:14,925 --> 00:36:17,469
Why not?

479
00:36:20,264 --> 00:36:22,558
- You?
- I had a big lunch.

480
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,637
I, your High Priest...

481
00:37:00,721 --> 00:37:04,600
of living Pagan perfection...

482
00:37:04,683 --> 00:37:09,062
do call the name Gathool!

483
00:37:09,146 --> 00:37:11,440
Do call the name Gathool!

484
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:14,234
Eelbazel!

485
00:37:14,318 --> 00:37:17,196
Ignodrohoth!

486
00:37:17,279 --> 00:37:19,072
Shaitan!

487
00:37:19,156 --> 00:37:22,784
Shaitan! Shaitan! Shaitan!

488
00:37:23,494 --> 00:37:25,579
Prepare the virgin.

489
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:33,086
"Prepare the virgin."
I don't like the sound of that.

490
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:35,631
Let's just hope
they're not referring to you.

491
00:37:36,715 --> 00:37:38,467
With this bat...

492
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:41,428
I do consecrate.

493
00:37:41,512 --> 00:37:43,347
With this bat, he does consecrate.

494
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:46,642
- The Madagascar Bat from the zoo.
- Good eye.

495
00:37:46,725 --> 00:37:49,645
With this lion's mane...

496
00:37:49,728 --> 00:37:51,355
I do consecrate.

497
00:37:51,438 --> 00:37:55,818
With this lion's mane,
he does consecrate.

498
00:37:55,901 --> 00:38:00,364
All that's missing is one humongous,
30-foot, groundhog-gulping reptile.

499
00:38:00,447 --> 00:38:03,867
For the final touch
to our brew tonight...

500
00:38:03,951 --> 00:38:08,330
a pristine virgin
in a gown of white.

501
00:38:20,884 --> 00:38:23,345
Evil bringeth here our plea.

502
00:38:23,428 --> 00:38:26,265
She's as pure as she can be.

503
00:38:26,348 --> 00:38:29,142
White and clean as driven snow.

504
00:38:29,226 --> 00:38:31,770
From Orange County, here we go!

505
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,695
Two to one, that's Enid Borden's
wedding dress.

506
00:38:41,822 --> 00:38:45,576
Twenty to one, Enid Borden never looked
that beautiful on her wedding day.

507
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:51,081
Virgin! Virgin!

508
00:38:55,294 --> 00:38:57,462
- Friday!
- Let's move!

509
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:07,181
Help!

510
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,682
Can you swim?

511
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:11,310
Red Cross. Junior Lifesaver
with clusters.

512
00:39:11,393 --> 00:39:13,395
Silly me.

513
00:39:19,485 --> 00:39:22,738
- Friday!
- Streebek?

514
00:39:22,821 --> 00:39:25,240
I found the snake.

515
00:39:25,324 --> 00:39:27,868
Help! Help!

516
00:39:28,952 --> 00:39:31,121
- Help!
- Hang in there. I'm coming.

517
00:39:31,205 --> 00:39:33,957
What goes on?
Who are those two clowns?

518
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:36,460
Who are you?

519
00:39:36,543 --> 00:39:39,421
Friday, Streebek,
Los Angeles police officers.

520
00:39:43,675 --> 00:39:47,221
- Where are you from?
- Anaheim.

521
00:39:48,889 --> 00:39:51,058
Her favourite colour is blue.

522
00:39:51,141 --> 00:39:53,310
Jesus Christ! I'm about to be eaten!

523
00:39:55,729 --> 00:39:59,608
Some big guys grabbed me
off the street last night.

524
00:40:01,235 --> 00:40:06,532
- Were you sexually assaulted?
- No, thank God. They needed a virgin.

525
00:40:07,574 --> 00:40:09,993
You're still a virgin?

526
00:40:11,286 --> 00:40:13,997
My hat's off to you, ma'am.
Hope you stay that way.

527
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:21,004
Streebek, quick! Do something.
It's constricting.

528
00:40:21,088 --> 00:40:23,841
Distract it.

529
00:40:49,783 --> 00:40:51,535
Anybody need boots?

530
00:40:55,414 --> 00:40:56,790
Stop them!

531
00:40:56,874 --> 00:40:58,292
Go!

532
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:15,642
Kill the good! Kill the good!

533
00:41:15,726 --> 00:41:19,938
Kill the good! Kill the good!
Kill the good! Kill the good!

534
00:41:20,022 --> 00:41:23,025
Kill the good! Kill the good!
Kill the good!

535
00:41:23,108 --> 00:41:24,735
You are under arrest.

536
00:41:26,904 --> 00:41:28,697
You can remain silent.

537
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:33,452
If you waive that right, anything you
say can and will be used against you.

538
00:41:33,535 --> 00:41:36,330
For crying out loud!

539
00:41:48,592 --> 00:41:51,094
How come his is so much bigger
than yours?

540
00:41:51,178 --> 00:41:53,514
- Miss?
- The gun.

541
00:41:53,597 --> 00:41:56,475
I've never needed more.

542
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:14,535
Come on, Joe!

543
00:42:23,752 --> 00:42:26,129
Gosh! I'm terribly sorry!

544
00:42:34,721 --> 00:42:37,057
Our car! We can steal it back.

545
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,767
Right.

546
00:42:38,851 --> 00:42:40,727
I'll drive.

547
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,691
Forget it. We're responsible
for a civilian's safety.

548
00:42:45,774 --> 00:42:48,819
And frankly, you don't belong
behind the wheel of a car.

549
00:42:57,911 --> 00:43:00,205
Hang on and keep your head down.

550
00:43:12,342 --> 00:43:14,011
Good driving!

551
00:43:14,094 --> 00:43:16,722
Yes, you were wonderful.

552
00:43:16,805 --> 00:43:20,142
Excuse me, miss.
I never did catch your name.

553
00:43:20,225 --> 00:43:23,854
Swail. Connie Swail.

554
00:43:23,937 --> 00:43:27,232
- Your name is Friday?
- Joe.

555
00:43:27,316 --> 00:43:29,318
Joe.

556
00:43:30,819 --> 00:43:32,529
Joe.

557
00:43:37,451 --> 00:43:39,620
Pep.

558
00:43:39,703 --> 00:43:41,455
Pep Streebek.

559
00:43:42,581 --> 00:43:45,042
Glad to meet you.

560
00:43:53,592 --> 00:43:56,803
You certainly have
a beautiful home, Miss Swail.

561
00:43:56,887 --> 00:44:00,516
You bet. Can the Beaver
come out and play?

562
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,278
- Good night.
- Good night.

563
00:44:20,536 --> 00:44:23,247
Will I ever see you again, Joe?

564
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:26,124
Absolutely.
You're our main witness.

565
00:44:26,208 --> 00:44:28,961
We'd like you to come downtown,
take a look at the mug books...

566
00:44:29,044 --> 00:44:31,463
see if you can make a positive I.D.
On the man you saw.

567
00:44:31,547 --> 00:44:34,174
I'll have a policewoman come here
tonight, keep an eye on the house...

568
00:44:34,258 --> 00:44:36,426
and bring you downtown
to Parker Center tomorrow.

569
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:38,136
Here's my card.

570
00:44:39,304 --> 00:44:42,474
You'll be needed
for further questioning.

571
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,319
I don't know why, but...

572
00:44:54,403 --> 00:44:58,240
somehow I feel
I could tell you anything, Joe.

573
00:45:02,661 --> 00:45:05,998
Friday, January 9, 3:12 a.m.

574
00:45:06,081 --> 00:45:09,042
We returned from Anaheim where we had
dropped off the virgin Connie Swail.

575
00:45:09,126 --> 00:45:12,254
I telephoned Captain Gannon at home,
waking him.

576
00:45:12,337 --> 00:45:15,257
After absorbing minutes
of gratuitous verbal abuse...

577
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:18,427
I requested him to meet us
as soon as possible at his office.

578
00:45:19,595 --> 00:45:21,221
Come in.

579
00:45:21,305 --> 00:45:23,515
- Evening, Captain.
- Captain.

580
00:45:25,184 --> 00:45:27,144
3:35 a.m.

581
00:45:27,227 --> 00:45:30,314
We related the details of our successful
follow-up on the Pagan robberies...

582
00:45:30,397 --> 00:45:33,692
and briefed Captain Gannon on the
outlandish festival we had attended...

583
00:45:33,775 --> 00:45:35,944
even going so far
as to demonstrate the goat dance...

584
00:45:36,028 --> 00:45:39,198
we had engaged in
as part of our undercover role.

585
00:45:42,075 --> 00:45:46,288
This music was pulsating
over and over again.

586
00:45:49,708 --> 00:45:51,376
Stop it!

587
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:54,087
At this point, Captain Gannon
became quite upset.

588
00:45:54,171 --> 00:45:56,215
He accused us of being
on a drinking binge...

589
00:45:56,298 --> 00:45:59,676
and based on our appearance, seemed
reluctant to contact the sheriff...

590
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,678
to investigate the area.

591
00:46:01,762 --> 00:46:05,307
Captain, call the sheriff's department.
I have the directions to the compound.

592
00:46:12,815 --> 00:46:14,399
Hay fever?

593
00:46:14,483 --> 00:46:16,735
Illegal hallucinogenic love drugs.

594
00:46:16,819 --> 00:46:20,072
The Pagans were taking them.
We tried to fit in.

595
00:46:20,155 --> 00:46:22,616
If it weren't for the drugs, we couldn't
have gotten away from the snake.

596
00:46:22,699 --> 00:46:24,493
The snake!

597
00:46:24,576 --> 00:46:28,413
I forgot about the snake.
How big did you say it was again?

598
00:46:28,497 --> 00:46:29,957
- 30 feet.
- 20 feet.

599
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:34,628
We'd like to have you come to the crime
scene and visually verify our report.

600
00:46:34,711 --> 00:46:36,713
If you could call
Commissioner Kirkpatrick...

601
00:46:36,797 --> 00:46:40,133
we believe this incident, because of its
magnitude, is worthy of her attention.

602
00:46:40,217 --> 00:46:43,470
Do you have any idea
what time it is?

603
00:46:43,554 --> 00:46:45,764
- Yes, sir.
- Don't ask him that, Captain.

604
00:46:45,848 --> 00:46:49,810
- It's 4:27 a.m., sir.
- He lives for that. It's in his blood.

605
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:54,523
Thursday, January 8, 5:45 a.m.

606
00:46:54,606 --> 00:46:57,776
Having gained Captain Gannon's grudging
agreement to contact the commissioner...

607
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:00,404
and proceed with us
to the San Gabriel Mountains...

608
00:47:00,487 --> 00:47:04,283
we eventually arrived at the scene
of the previous night's debauchery.

609
00:47:11,999 --> 00:47:15,586
What is this?
Some sort of juvenile cop humour?

610
00:47:15,669 --> 00:47:18,338
And where the hell
is this supposed Pagan festival?

611
00:47:18,422 --> 00:47:22,217
I can't understand it. There was a huge
screen with Pagan vision written on it.

612
00:47:22,301 --> 00:47:25,721
Yeah! Yeah! This was the hole
that was filled with water.

613
00:47:25,804 --> 00:47:29,600
We had to dive in to save the virgin
being eaten by the giant snake.

614
00:47:29,683 --> 00:47:32,394
Who are these painted cretins?

615
00:47:32,477 --> 00:47:36,523
- Two of my best men, ma'am.
- That's right. That's right.

616
00:47:36,607 --> 00:47:38,984
They're heading up
the Pagan investigation.

617
00:47:39,067 --> 00:47:43,363
They were heading up the investigation.
Now you may consider them off it.

618
00:47:43,447 --> 00:47:46,074
- But, Commissioner?
- Gannon.

619
00:47:46,158 --> 00:47:48,702
What am I going to tell the press?

620
00:47:48,785 --> 00:47:52,289
That now we are investigating
invisible crimes on the word of two...

621
00:47:52,372 --> 00:47:54,124
trick-or-treaters?

622
00:47:54,208 --> 00:47:57,503
You are a civilian and probably unaware
the department's "regs"...

623
00:47:57,586 --> 00:48:00,756
authorize us to wear specialized apparel
during a simulation surveillance.

624
00:48:01,757 --> 00:48:06,345
- I assume you were once a civilian.
- Yes, ma'am.

625
00:48:06,428 --> 00:48:10,807
If you do not drop that insubordinate
tone, you'll be one again soon.

626
00:48:13,393 --> 00:48:15,187
Wait a minute, Friday.

627
00:48:16,647 --> 00:48:19,316
I've never known you to act this way.

628
00:48:19,399 --> 00:48:23,445
Certainly not the behaviour
your Uncle Joe would have approved of.

629
00:48:23,529 --> 00:48:26,657
You know the kind of man he was.

630
00:48:27,533 --> 00:48:31,703
I suggest you try to be
a little more like him from now on.

631
00:48:31,787 --> 00:48:33,747
Yeah, sir. I'll try.

632
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:35,874
Good.

633
00:48:52,641 --> 00:48:56,395
I'm sorry, Joe.
He's not in any of these.

634
00:48:56,478 --> 00:48:58,564
And I'll never forget his face.

635
00:48:59,606 --> 00:49:04,653
Okay. I guess this officially closes
my end of the investigation.

636
00:49:08,699 --> 00:49:12,161
As far as your personal safety
is concerned, I wouldn't worry.

637
00:49:12,244 --> 00:49:15,164
That guy's probably
200 miles from here by now.

638
00:49:24,214 --> 00:49:28,594
10:30 a.m. I picked up Streebek at his
sanitationally-questionable commune...

639
00:49:28,677 --> 00:49:31,763
his apartment building in the "come
as you are" section of Venice Beach.

640
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,489
The door was opened
by Police Officer Betsy Blees...

641
00:49:48,572 --> 00:49:52,910
who had dropped by to chat about more
effective methods of law enforcement.

642
00:49:52,993 --> 00:49:55,454
They'd been playing a version
of good-cop, bad-cop.

643
00:49:55,537 --> 00:49:59,750
Though I was unable to fathom the rules,
it seemed Streebek had lost this round.

644
00:50:01,043 --> 00:50:03,003
Playtime was over...

645
00:50:03,086 --> 00:50:05,672
and it was back to routine duty
for me and Pep Streebek.

646
00:50:05,756 --> 00:50:10,886
Joe, I suddenly got very hungry.
Let's grab some sushi.

647
00:50:10,969 --> 00:50:14,932
We're late for our watch already,
and raw tuna isn't my bag.

648
00:50:34,451 --> 00:50:36,578
My hat was in that car.

649
00:50:36,662 --> 00:50:40,457
- I can tell who reblocked it for you.
- Pagans.

650
00:50:40,541 --> 00:50:41,959
I need coffee.

651
00:50:42,042 --> 00:50:44,670
I know where they serve
the best in town. Come on.

652
00:51:14,366 --> 00:51:15,868
Ma'am.

653
00:51:25,627 --> 00:51:30,007
I hate to admit it, but for once in your
life you're right. This is good coffee.

654
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:32,301
You should try the French toast.

655
00:51:32,384 --> 00:51:34,636
Joe, lend me 20 bucks.

656
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,307
Do I know you long enough
to lend you money? I don't think so.

657
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:40,309
We've been ordered off the Pagans...

658
00:51:40,392 --> 00:51:43,937
but that doesn't mean we can't follow up
on one of their thefts.

659
00:51:44,021 --> 00:51:47,483
The trichlornitromethane and
the pseudo-halogenic compound cyanogen.

660
00:51:47,566 --> 00:51:52,529
There's one illegal lab in the city with
the capacity, personnel and equipment...

661
00:51:52,613 --> 00:51:54,781
to mix those two chemicals
into a deadly gas.

662
00:51:54,865 --> 00:51:58,785
Narcotics has been waiting for months to
bust this place. We can do it tonight.

663
00:51:58,869 --> 00:52:01,580
Forget it.
It's out of our jurisdiction now.

664
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:05,334
But this won't be a Pagan investigation.
We can bring Narc in on it.

665
00:52:05,417 --> 00:52:09,922
Police work is a matter of us
against them, not "Mother, may I?"

666
00:52:10,005 --> 00:52:14,009
Hi, Kay. How are you? I could find out
where they set up the lab this week.

667
00:52:14,092 --> 00:52:17,471
- Oh? How?
- By you lending me 20 bucks.

668
00:52:25,521 --> 00:52:29,733
6:30 p.m. After witnessing
the gratuitous sex display...

669
00:52:29,817 --> 00:52:32,986
at Streebek's favourite coffeehouse
and an outlay of $50 by me...

670
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:37,449
to one of his old informants,
I proceeded by Celebrity Cab...

671
00:52:37,533 --> 00:52:40,285
to 3396834108th Street...

672
00:52:40,369 --> 00:52:44,248
an illegal drug lab disguised
as a legitimate place of business.

673
00:52:45,374 --> 00:52:47,292
Streebek had gone to seek assistance
from friends...

674
00:52:47,376 --> 00:52:50,254
in the undercover narcotics unit
where he used to work.

675
00:52:50,337 --> 00:52:52,256
It didn't surprise me
that he was late...

676
00:52:52,339 --> 00:52:54,299
even though he knew I was waiting
in a part of town...

677
00:52:54,383 --> 00:52:57,511
where it's not advisable
to stand around whistling.

678
00:53:03,267 --> 00:53:05,310
Hey, zipper-head!

679
00:53:08,856 --> 00:53:10,983
Up late tonight, kids?

680
00:53:11,066 --> 00:53:13,026
Let's have one of your smokes.

681
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:15,571
It's an unhealthy habit
I don't encourage in others.

682
00:53:15,654 --> 00:53:17,865
Get smart.
Give it up by not taking it up.

683
00:53:17,948 --> 00:53:19,867
Thanks for
the public service announcement.

684
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:23,328
Hand over your money,
and I'll go buy my own smokes.

685
00:53:23,412 --> 00:53:26,540
If you're that strapped for cash,
I'd suggest a part-time job.

686
00:53:26,623 --> 00:53:28,542
How 'bout a paper route?

687
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:30,961
It builds character.
It did in my case.

688
00:53:31,044 --> 00:53:35,048
Hey, we're not askin' you
for your money, Ozzie.

689
00:53:35,132 --> 00:53:37,551
- No?
- No.

690
00:53:37,634 --> 00:53:42,514
- Are you threatening me, son?
- Ooh!

691
00:54:14,546 --> 00:54:16,924
And on a school night, too.

692
00:54:36,693 --> 00:54:38,278
Hit the deck!

693
00:55:13,188 --> 00:55:15,399
I can't quite place it.

694
00:55:16,817 --> 00:55:18,235
It tastes like...

695
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:19,903
Milk.

696
00:55:19,987 --> 00:55:23,407
Just like the sign said on the building
before you obliterated it.

697
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:26,160
Fresh, wholesome milk.

698
00:55:26,243 --> 00:55:28,829
You probably love this stuff,
don't you?

699
00:55:28,912 --> 00:55:31,665
Vitamin D, calcium...

700
00:55:31,748 --> 00:55:34,877
essential for good strong bones
and healthy teeth.

701
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,755
But that's probably all Greek to you,
isn't it, Mr Gingivitis?

702
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:44,011
7:15 p.m.

703
00:55:44,094 --> 00:55:48,265
After explaining to the milk factory
they could not take legal action...

704
00:55:48,348 --> 00:55:50,350
since we had properly obtained
a search warrant...

705
00:55:50,434 --> 00:55:52,352
our apology was
reluctantly accepted...

706
00:55:52,436 --> 00:55:55,939
and Streebek and I were on
our way back to Parker Center.

707
00:55:56,023 --> 00:55:58,734
After losing two previous vehicles
we had been issued...

708
00:55:58,817 --> 00:56:01,445
the only car the department would
release to us at this point...

709
00:56:01,528 --> 00:56:04,448
was an unmarked 1987 Yugo...

710
00:56:04,531 --> 00:56:08,744
a Yugoslavian import donated
as a test vehicle by that country...

711
00:56:08,827 --> 00:56:12,581
and reflecting the cutting edge
of Serbo-Croatian technology.

712
00:56:48,867 --> 00:56:52,037
I've been thinking.
Maybe your informant was right.

713
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,081
Maybe the Pagans anticipated our raid...

714
00:56:54,164 --> 00:56:56,750
and mixed those chemicals
into a deadly gas before we got there.

715
00:56:56,834 --> 00:56:59,503
Nuh-huh.

716
00:56:59,586 --> 00:57:02,047
- Friday?
- That's me.

717
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:04,049
What do you like to do for fun?

718
00:57:05,467 --> 00:57:08,345
I'm your partner, and
I don't even know where you live.

719
00:57:08,428 --> 00:57:10,347
That's right, mister, you don't.

720
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:16,603
Streebek, why are you always looking
at your watch?

721
00:57:16,687 --> 00:57:18,605
I'm watching my TV.

722
00:57:18,689 --> 00:57:23,235
You don't like my music, you don't want
to talk, so I'm watching my TV.

723
00:57:23,318 --> 00:57:25,279
We're at the Law and Order
Foundation dinner...

724
00:57:25,362 --> 00:57:29,449
where Los Angeles mayor, Peter Parvin,
is fighting for his political survival.

725
00:57:29,533 --> 00:57:33,453
Leading that attack again is
Police Commissioner Jane Kirkpatrick.

726
00:57:33,453 --> 00:57:35,789
Let's hear what she has to say.

727
00:57:35,789 --> 00:57:40,460
This rampaging gang of Pagans has made
a mockery of city administration.

728
00:57:40,544 --> 00:57:43,630
Vehicles from the fire and police
departments are stolen in daylight.

729
00:57:43,714 --> 00:57:49,052
Deadly toxic chemicals are on the loose.
What next, Mr Mayor?

730
00:57:49,136 --> 00:57:51,138
In my opinion...

731
00:57:51,138 --> 00:57:54,433
Mayor Parvin should consider
the welfare of his constituents...

732
00:57:54,516 --> 00:57:56,810
and do the honourable thing:

733
00:57:56,894 --> 00:57:58,770
Resign now.

734
00:58:01,732 --> 00:58:05,027
You know, I think you and the
commissioner would make a cute couple.

735
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:07,070
You both keep your jaws locked.

736
00:58:07,154 --> 00:58:10,449
Plus you two share
that curious affection for hats.

737
00:58:10,532 --> 00:58:12,993
May I remind you that
Commissioner Kirkpatrick...

738
00:58:13,076 --> 00:58:15,829
threatened to turn me
into a civilian?

739
00:58:15,913 --> 00:58:18,832
Yeah, I know.
There was a gleam in her eye, though.

740
00:58:18,916 --> 00:58:20,667
Put a clamp on it!

741
00:58:20,751 --> 00:58:23,837
I have never been elected
to public office.

742
00:58:23,921 --> 00:58:28,509
I have always sought the approval
of a somewhat higher power...

743
00:58:28,592 --> 00:58:30,093
for my actions.

744
00:58:30,177 --> 00:58:33,180
The sad truth...

745
00:58:33,263 --> 00:58:36,016
is that we live here now
in a city...

746
00:58:36,099 --> 00:58:40,187
where even a gross pornographer
like Jerry Caesar...

747
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:43,482
is not immune from lawlessness!

748
00:58:43,565 --> 00:58:47,528
With this grim fact in mind...

749
00:58:47,611 --> 00:58:51,156
I am relieved to announce tonight...

750
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:54,701
that even Mr Caesar himself
has bravely decided...

751
00:58:54,785 --> 00:58:57,830
to strike a blow in our common fight
against crime!

752
00:58:57,913 --> 00:58:59,873
Yes, sir! Yes, indeed!

753
00:59:01,458 --> 00:59:04,878
This guy knows God personally.
I hear they play racquetball together.

754
00:59:04,962 --> 00:59:08,382
Just chuckle away.
I don't hear God laughing.

755
00:59:08,465 --> 00:59:10,884
You will once He sees your haircut.

756
00:59:11,885 --> 00:59:16,640
My friends, in an unprecedented
gesture of atonement...

757
00:59:16,723 --> 00:59:20,519
Mr Caesar has agreed
to donate the sum...

758
00:59:20,602 --> 00:59:25,399
of $1 million
to my Moral Advance Movement.

759
00:59:29,444 --> 00:59:31,405
7:52 p.m.

760
00:59:31,488 --> 00:59:34,575
After witnessing the raging political
turmoil on Streebek's puny TV...

761
00:59:34,658 --> 00:59:37,953
I was really looking forward
to the end of a rotten day.

762
00:59:38,036 --> 00:59:42,416
- Well, want to get something to eat?
- Not tonight. I have plans.

763
00:59:42,499 --> 00:59:46,044
You do? What? What?

764
00:59:46,128 --> 00:59:49,423
Where do you go? What is her name?
Does she have a sister?

765
00:59:49,506 --> 00:59:51,675
Good night, Streebek.

766
00:59:54,428 --> 00:59:57,639
Truth is, I don't care where you go.

767
01:00:01,685 --> 01:00:03,812
Yeah, I do.
I gotta know.

768
01:00:31,381 --> 01:00:33,300
I knew it.

769
01:00:33,383 --> 01:00:35,886
It's Nightmare on Elm Street.

770
01:00:35,969 --> 01:00:39,640
That would make him Freddie Krueger.

771
01:00:41,016 --> 01:00:43,519
We're gonna be driving along some night
and the lighting's gonna be bad.

772
01:00:43,602 --> 01:00:47,731
He's gonna mistake me for some
pretty coed, and out comes that claw.

773
01:00:53,195 --> 01:00:55,239
170 pounds of ground chuck.

774
01:00:57,908 --> 01:01:02,996
Who knows what kind of thrill-seeking
hose monster he's got stashed in there?

775
01:01:09,753 --> 01:01:13,340
My God, he's dating Mother Goose!
Hey, Joe!

776
01:01:13,423 --> 01:01:16,677
Streebek, what are you doing here?

777
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:20,138
- Who is this nice-looking young man?
- He's nobody.

778
01:01:20,222 --> 01:01:22,015
My partner.

779
01:01:22,099 --> 01:01:25,185
Streebek, introduce yourself
to my grandmother, quickly.

780
01:01:25,269 --> 01:01:28,856
Well, what a pleasant surprise.

781
01:01:28,939 --> 01:01:30,858
Granny Friday.

782
01:01:30,941 --> 01:01:34,444
She's my maternal grandmother.
Her name is Mundy.

783
01:01:35,737 --> 01:01:39,032
Why don't we discuss this over dinner?
It's my birthday.

784
01:01:39,116 --> 01:01:43,370
We're going to the Brown Derby.
Do join us, Detective Swayback.

785
01:01:43,453 --> 01:01:45,372
- Streebek.
- Pep.

786
01:01:45,455 --> 01:01:47,457
I don't think it's a good idea.

787
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:51,044
- Why not, Joe?
- Yeah, Joe, why not?

788
01:01:51,128 --> 01:01:56,466
I've invited someone already
to join us, and you don't know her.

789
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:57,885
- Her?
- Her?

790
01:01:57,968 --> 01:02:01,180
Joe! You have a date?

791
01:02:06,268 --> 01:02:08,854
I'm so proud!

792
01:02:12,274 --> 01:02:15,736
Well, it looks like
I have a date, too.

793
01:02:15,819 --> 01:02:18,947
Granny Mundy, may I escort you
to Joe's car?

794
01:02:19,031 --> 01:02:22,534
I'd be privileged,
Detective Startrek.

795
01:02:26,622 --> 01:02:30,751
9:00 p.m. Exactly one night after
witnessing the satanic cult rally...

796
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:35,339
I escorted my grandmother to her
favourite restaurant, the Brown Derby.

797
01:02:35,422 --> 01:02:40,260
There was someone I wanted her to meet,
and it wasn't Detective Streebek.

798
01:02:40,344 --> 01:02:42,763
Sergeant Friday, your table is ready.

799
01:02:42,846 --> 01:02:45,682
I took the liberty of pouring
the Dom Perignon.

800
01:02:45,766 --> 01:02:47,226
What Dom Perignon?

801
01:02:47,309 --> 01:02:51,563
I stopped and phoned in an order
in honour of Granny Mundy's birthday.

802
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:54,691
You'd want her to have
the most expensive kind, wouldn't you?

803
01:02:54,775 --> 01:02:58,779
What a thoughtful gesture!
Don't you think so, Joe?

804
01:02:58,862 --> 01:03:02,199
Yes, Granny.
It was very considerate of him.

805
01:03:11,416 --> 01:03:14,795
Hello, Joe.
Guess I'm early.

806
01:03:14,878 --> 01:03:16,797
I was kind of excited.

807
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,966
You sly minx!

808
01:03:20,676 --> 01:03:23,512
I'd like you to meet my maternal
grandmother, Mrs. Grace Mundy.

809
01:03:23,595 --> 01:03:25,597
Granny, this is
the virgin Connie Swail.

810
01:03:27,558 --> 01:03:28,976
You're kidding?

811
01:03:29,059 --> 01:03:30,978
Hi.

812
01:03:31,061 --> 01:03:34,773
Well, allow me.
The place of honour for Granny.

813
01:03:34,857 --> 01:03:37,192
- Thank you.
- Certainly.

814
01:03:39,736 --> 01:03:42,406
And if I may, a toast.

815
01:03:42,489 --> 01:03:43,949
To Granny Mundy.

816
01:03:44,032 --> 01:03:47,244
May you live as long as you want
but never want as long as you live.

817
01:03:49,246 --> 01:03:50,706
Hear! Hear!

818
01:03:54,084 --> 01:03:56,670
Ahhh.

819
01:03:56,753 --> 01:03:59,006
This is such a happy restaurant.

820
01:03:59,089 --> 01:04:02,092
Commissioner Kirkpatrick,
how nice to see you again.

821
01:04:02,176 --> 01:04:04,678
Reverend Whirley,
it's a privilege.

822
01:04:06,847 --> 01:04:08,765
An aperitif, perhaps?

823
01:04:08,849 --> 01:04:12,186
I once saw Alan Hale, Jr. In here.

824
01:04:12,269 --> 01:04:15,814
Alan Hale, Jr! Wow!
"Gilligan, little buddy!"

825
01:04:15,898 --> 01:04:20,694
Don't order anything more expensive than
the Cobb salad. That is an order.

826
01:04:20,777 --> 01:04:23,530
Oh, my God!

827
01:04:23,614 --> 01:04:26,033
- Connie?
- That's him.

828
01:04:26,116 --> 01:04:28,285
That man with the collar.

829
01:04:28,368 --> 01:04:30,287
The Reverend Whirley?

830
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:33,874
He's the one who kidnapped me
and threw me in that pit...

831
01:04:33,957 --> 01:04:36,126
with that horrible snake.

832
01:04:37,252 --> 01:04:40,214
I'll never forget his face
as long as I live.

833
01:04:40,297 --> 01:04:42,925
You have to be sure about this.

834
01:04:43,008 --> 01:04:45,886
How about very, very sure?

835
01:04:45,969 --> 01:04:48,388
I'm positive, Joe.

836
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:50,307
That's him.

837
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:52,351
The face behind the mask.

838
01:04:53,977 --> 01:04:56,563
The man who tried to kill me.

839
01:04:59,942 --> 01:05:02,986
Would you testify to that under oath
in a court of law?

840
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:05,823
Wait a minute. Settle down.

841
01:05:05,906 --> 01:05:09,201
Let's think about this.
That is Jonathan Whirley.

842
01:05:09,284 --> 01:05:12,579
Head of the Moral Advance Movement
of America. He's a public hero.

843
01:05:12,663 --> 01:05:16,500
- You can't just walk up to him...
- Streebek.

844
01:05:16,583 --> 01:05:18,752
Vermin aren't allowed
inside restaurants.

845
01:05:18,836 --> 01:05:21,004
I'll be enforcing
the public health code.

846
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:25,008
If you'll both excuse me...

847
01:05:25,092 --> 01:05:28,595
I'm afraid
the second-highest duty calls.

848
01:05:33,851 --> 01:05:37,396
Joe, he is sitting with the commissioner
and our captain.

849
01:05:37,479 --> 01:05:40,941
Bust him now, tomorrow you'll
be mucking out stalls at Horse Patrol.

850
01:05:48,282 --> 01:05:49,700
Thank you.

851
01:05:51,743 --> 01:05:53,162
I am sorry.

852
01:05:53,245 --> 01:05:56,206
Hold it there, Whirley. Police Officer.
You're under arrest.

853
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:58,709
I beg your pardon?
Is this some sort of feeble joke?

854
01:05:58,792 --> 01:06:04,464
Oh, it's a knee-slapper, if you consider
Penal Codes 484207 A597 and 217...

855
01:06:04,548 --> 01:06:07,342
theft, kidnapping, cruelty to animals,
attempted murder things to laugh about.

856
01:06:07,467 --> 01:06:09,928
I don't know
what you're talking about.

857
01:06:10,012 --> 01:06:12,806
My partner and I witnessed
that torchlight picnic you threw.

858
01:06:12,890 --> 01:06:16,560
We're gonna put you where your kind
always ends up: In a 7-by-7 cage...

859
01:06:16,643 --> 01:06:20,981
in some hundred-year-old penitentiary
with a wooden plank for a bed.

860
01:06:21,064 --> 01:06:24,526
Sure, this city isn't perfect. We need
a smut-free life for all our citizens.

861
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:26,904
Cleaner streets, better schools,
a good hockey team.

862
01:06:26,987 --> 01:06:30,991
But the difference between you and me is
you made the promise, I'm gonna keep it.

863
01:06:44,963 --> 01:06:48,884
Our good reverend's an amazing
piece of work, isn't he, Jane?

864
01:06:48,967 --> 01:06:52,054
- May I call you Jane?
- No.

865
01:06:59,978 --> 01:07:02,231
Captain, Commissioner...

866
01:07:02,314 --> 01:07:05,359
I demand an immediate explanation
for this outrageous behaviour.

867
01:07:05,442 --> 01:07:07,569
It's him again.

868
01:07:07,653 --> 01:07:10,072
Are you insane?

869
01:07:10,155 --> 01:07:13,909
Reverend Whirley abducted that girl,
had his men throw her in a pit...

870
01:07:13,992 --> 01:07:16,870
filled with polluted water
and a giant Bolivian jungle snake.

871
01:07:16,954 --> 01:07:19,623
These accusations are preposterous!

872
01:07:19,706 --> 01:07:23,502
I beg to differ. Ask him if he remembers
3,000 gallons of stolen...

873
01:07:23,585 --> 01:07:26,588
trichlornitromethane and the
pseudo-halogenic compound cyanogen...

874
01:07:26,672 --> 01:07:28,799
which, when mixed properly,
form a liquid fertilizer that burns...

875
01:07:28,882 --> 01:07:32,427
the throat, eyes, lungs, and nose,
and could cause vomiting and death.

876
01:07:32,511 --> 01:07:35,264
We're just about to eat here!

877
01:07:35,347 --> 01:07:39,184
Reverend Whirley, please accept
our most sincere apologies.

878
01:07:39,268 --> 01:07:42,437
Sergeant, you will remove
those handcuffs immediately.

879
01:07:42,521 --> 01:07:45,399
Then you will hand in your badge.
You are relieved from duty.

880
01:07:45,482 --> 01:07:47,025
But... But...
But, Commissioner...

881
01:07:47,109 --> 01:07:48,610
Now!

882
01:07:50,612 --> 01:07:52,739
Yes, sir. Ma'am.

883
01:07:52,823 --> 01:07:56,076
I don't care.
I'm absolutely humiliated.

884
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:00,205
I know the young man was overzealous,
but he springs from a great tradition.

885
01:08:00,289 --> 01:08:03,584
Commissioner, won't you please
change your mind?

886
01:08:15,554 --> 01:08:19,141
I'm afraid I'll have to take
your badge and gun.

887
01:08:19,224 --> 01:08:23,270
- If we could just please...
- I don't want to discuss it!

888
01:08:23,353 --> 01:08:25,981
Just hand them over.

889
01:08:56,053 --> 01:09:01,099
Look, Joe, don't worry. I'm still
on active duty. I'm building a case.

890
01:09:01,183 --> 01:09:03,477
You're building nothin'.

891
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:07,731
If I ever hear you've come
within one mile of Reverend Whirley...

892
01:09:07,815 --> 01:09:09,817
I'll have your badge for breakfast!

893
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:13,028
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

894
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:25,207
It was very nice of you to try
and take us out to dinner, Joe.

895
01:09:25,290 --> 01:09:29,044
Yeah. Thanks, Joe, for everything.

896
01:09:30,796 --> 01:09:35,717
Let's not stand around here moping.
I'm hungry! Let's go for chili dogs.

897
01:09:35,801 --> 01:09:41,140
Granny, have you ever eaten a chili dog
off the back of a motorcycle?

898
01:09:41,223 --> 01:09:43,142
Not till now.

899
01:09:43,225 --> 01:09:46,687
You smooth-talking son of a gun.

900
01:09:56,738 --> 01:09:59,658
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

901
01:10:04,746 --> 01:10:07,541
I'm very sorry
you lost your job, Joe.

902
01:10:07,624 --> 01:10:09,918
I really did have
a very good time.

903
01:10:10,002 --> 01:10:12,212
I'm glad, Connie.

904
01:10:12,296 --> 01:10:15,340
Now, fasten your seat belt.
I can still effect a citizen's arrest.

905
01:10:15,424 --> 01:10:18,760
I don't want to ruin a wonderful evening
by bringing you in on a misdemeanour.

906
01:10:20,095 --> 01:10:21,930
That was a joke.

907
01:10:23,056 --> 01:10:25,392
Oh.

908
01:10:40,073 --> 01:10:42,284
Oh, Joe!

909
01:10:42,367 --> 01:10:44,369
Look at the stars!

910
01:10:44,453 --> 01:10:46,622
Dozens of them.

911
01:10:48,999 --> 01:10:53,212
You know, when I was a little girl...

912
01:10:53,295 --> 01:10:56,256
I used to wish upon
a different star every night...

913
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:59,760
for that special someone to come along.

914
01:10:59,843 --> 01:11:02,471
Someone with whom
I could share...

915
01:11:04,556 --> 01:11:06,642
everything.

916
01:11:11,188 --> 01:11:13,607
I guess that's not so unusual.

917
01:11:14,525 --> 01:11:18,111
All girls do that, don't they, Joe?

918
01:11:18,195 --> 01:11:20,823
Some guys do, too, Connie.

919
01:11:24,618 --> 01:11:26,995
- Joe?
- That's me.

920
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:30,499
Was there ever...

921
01:11:33,252 --> 01:11:34,670
anyone else?

922
01:11:34,753 --> 01:11:36,588
Of course there was.

923
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,675
Oh.

924
01:11:39,758 --> 01:11:43,595
Actually, I've only been driving
with Streebek a couple of days.

925
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:46,932
- Before that I was with Frank.
- That's not what I meant.

926
01:12:12,624 --> 01:12:15,460
Goodness! Earthquake! It's the big one!

927
01:12:15,544 --> 01:12:17,880
Joe, help!

928
01:12:17,963 --> 01:12:19,590
Request Code 3.
Officer in distress.

929
01:12:19,673 --> 01:12:22,467
Assist officer.
I'll handle this. Calm down.

930
01:12:28,599 --> 01:12:31,351
January 9, 8:37 a.m.

931
01:12:31,435 --> 01:12:34,146
My name's Streebek.
I'm a cop.

932
01:12:34,229 --> 01:12:35,647
I overslept.

933
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:42,571
Curiously enough, I still hadn't heard
from my anal-retentive ex-partner...

934
01:12:42,654 --> 01:12:45,908
although I was sure he'd be proud to
know I was making a concerted effort...

935
01:12:45,991 --> 01:12:48,368
to personally develop
a close relationship...

936
01:12:48,452 --> 01:12:51,830
with one of my sisters
in the Los Angeles Police Department.

937
01:13:14,394 --> 01:13:17,064
I placed a call
to the virgin Connie Swail...

938
01:13:17,147 --> 01:13:20,317
but according to the girl's mother,
she hadn't come home either.

939
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:23,237
I don't know what to say, Mrs. Swail.

940
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:25,948
I'm beginning to be concerned myself.

941
01:13:26,031 --> 01:13:29,993
No, Joe Friday has never
stayed out all night, either.

942
01:13:30,077 --> 01:13:33,705
The day he was born,
his mother had him home by 9:00.

943
01:13:33,789 --> 01:13:37,876
Well, let's both stay in touch
in case we hear from them.

944
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:40,003
Thank you, Mrs. Swail.

945
01:13:43,173 --> 01:13:46,093
Oh, my goodness.
I'm gonna be late for my stake-out.

946
01:13:47,261 --> 01:13:49,263
As enchanting as Robin was...

947
01:13:49,346 --> 01:13:53,350
I still couldn't get my mind off
what happened to Joe Friday.

948
01:13:53,433 --> 01:13:55,727
For one misguided moment...

949
01:13:55,811 --> 01:13:59,148
I actually pictured my ex-partner
introducing that little cupcake...

950
01:13:59,231 --> 01:14:03,235
to the one piece of equipment that
wasn't issued to him by the department.

951
01:14:03,318 --> 01:14:07,948
But then I realized Joe would never
spring for the price of a motel room.

952
01:14:08,031 --> 01:14:11,618
And since having sex in a Yugo
was a logistical impossibility...

953
01:14:11,702 --> 01:14:14,913
I came to the conclusion
that something must be wrong.

954
01:14:14,997 --> 01:14:16,665
Who cares?

955
01:14:16,748 --> 01:14:18,625
Listen to me, Captain.

956
01:14:18,709 --> 01:14:21,795
Joe Friday was the most dedicated cop
in this city.

957
01:14:21,879 --> 01:14:24,840
Okay, so maybe all his dogs
aren't attached to one leash.

958
01:14:24,923 --> 01:14:27,551
He's thickheaded, insensitive
and reactionary.

959
01:14:27,634 --> 01:14:31,180
And generally less fun to be around
than any person I've ever met.

960
01:14:31,263 --> 01:14:34,099
Still, he was my partner.

961
01:14:34,183 --> 01:14:36,643
You want to find Joe Friday?

962
01:14:36,727 --> 01:14:40,814
My advice is to start checking out
the sanitariums.

963
01:14:42,483 --> 01:14:44,401
- Hey, Pep.
- What's shaking?

964
01:14:44,485 --> 01:14:46,862
- Hey, you!
- Me, Pep?

965
01:14:47,946 --> 01:14:50,365
Detective Streebek to you.
Let's get this mop trimmed.

966
01:14:50,449 --> 01:14:52,534
Stop shaving with a pocketknife,
and next time you eat your lunch...

967
01:14:52,618 --> 01:14:54,536
put it in your stomach,
not on your uniform.

968
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:57,456
You're a disgrace to this department
and that badge.

969
01:15:13,472 --> 01:15:15,474
You're late, Jerry.

970
01:15:17,142 --> 01:15:21,897
I saw your announcement about my
so-called million-dollar contribution.

971
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:24,066
Do yourself a favour, friend.

972
01:15:25,359 --> 01:15:26,902
Try the lottery.

973
01:15:26,985 --> 01:15:28,946
The lottery I can fix.

974
01:15:29,029 --> 01:15:31,323
Our problem is Mayor Parvin.

975
01:15:31,406 --> 01:15:35,661
I'm afraid he is not
"going gentle into that good night."

976
01:15:35,744 --> 01:15:37,162
Say what?

977
01:15:37,246 --> 01:15:41,291
That he is not responding
to our pressure to resign.

978
01:15:41,375 --> 01:15:44,044
We're gonna have to push him
over the edge.

979
01:15:44,127 --> 01:15:48,382
Your million-dollar contribution
will insure his presence at your party.

980
01:15:48,465 --> 01:15:53,095
Just make sure he turns into
a drug-crazed idiot, with pictures.

981
01:15:53,178 --> 01:15:55,931
Once he's politically dead,
Commissioner Kirkpatrick...

982
01:15:56,014 --> 01:15:58,392
will be a shoo-in to replace him
in the next election.

983
01:15:58,475 --> 01:16:01,937
You and I will split control
of the city.

984
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:04,189
You will monopolize all pornography.

985
01:16:04,273 --> 01:16:07,943
Half the poor dumb sheep in Los Angeles
will be forking over money...

986
01:16:08,026 --> 01:16:10,070
to buy your sleaze...

987
01:16:10,154 --> 01:16:12,948
while the other half will be funding me
with the means to fight it.

988
01:16:14,449 --> 01:16:15,868
Reverend...

989
01:16:17,035 --> 01:16:19,621
you got balls as big as church bells.

990
01:16:21,206 --> 01:16:22,749
Thank you.

991
01:16:39,558 --> 01:16:43,312
Jonathan, I do not trust that man.

992
01:16:43,395 --> 01:16:46,315
Thank goodness he trusts me.

993
01:16:46,398 --> 01:16:48,692
That socially-retarded hedonist...

994
01:16:48,775 --> 01:16:52,237
actually believes he's going
to be alive tomorrow.

995
01:17:29,441 --> 01:17:31,109
Where's Joe Friday?

996
01:17:44,748 --> 01:17:46,166
It's no use.

997
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:48,168
These knots are too tight.

998
01:17:48,252 --> 01:17:50,838
Untie the girl.
She's coming with me.

999
01:17:53,465 --> 01:17:57,719
You hypocrite. If you were decent,
you'd let her go and kill me instead.

1000
01:17:57,803 --> 01:17:59,221
Instead?

1001
01:18:00,597 --> 01:18:05,686
But, my dear Sergeant Friday,
I'd always planned on killing you.

1002
01:18:05,769 --> 01:18:08,438
How do you see yourself
going down in history?

1003
01:18:08,522 --> 01:18:10,858
Pagan or reverend,
devil or angel?

1004
01:18:10,941 --> 01:18:14,278
Why, both, of course.

1005
01:18:14,361 --> 01:18:16,697
One can't exist without the other.

1006
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:19,658
Without the Jerry Caesars,
there'd be no moral outrage.

1007
01:18:19,741 --> 01:18:21,910
What's the good of moral outrage...

1008
01:18:21,994 --> 01:18:25,205
unless you have something tangible
to direct it against?

1009
01:18:25,289 --> 01:18:27,958
By this time tomorrow,
thanks to that poison gas...

1010
01:18:28,041 --> 01:18:30,752
you've been tracking
like some flu-ridden bloodhound...

1011
01:18:30,836 --> 01:18:34,756
Mr Caesar will be sitting
in that big Jacuzzi in the sky...

1012
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:37,259
and I'll control both sides
of the equation.

1013
01:18:37,342 --> 01:18:40,762
Sure, but like every other psycho
in this city with a foolproof plan...

1014
01:18:40,846 --> 01:18:43,724
you've forgotten you're facing the
finest fighting force ever assembled.

1015
01:18:45,184 --> 01:18:46,602
The Israelis?

1016
01:18:46,685 --> 01:18:49,438
Try the decent, hardworking
men and women of Los Angeles.

1017
01:18:51,523 --> 01:18:53,817
Forgotten about them?

1018
01:18:53,901 --> 01:18:56,111
My dear Sergeant...

1019
01:18:56,195 --> 01:18:59,656
I'm absolutely counting on them.

1020
01:19:02,075 --> 01:19:04,036
Joe.

1021
01:19:04,119 --> 01:19:06,288
Joe?

1022
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:45,577
You may have taken a wrong turn,
but there's time to straighten out.

1023
01:19:45,661 --> 01:19:47,955
You're the one that's gonna
straighten out, cop...

1024
01:19:48,038 --> 01:19:49,957
all the way down the mountain.

1025
01:19:54,378 --> 01:19:55,796
Let's go, Streebek.

1026
01:20:25,534 --> 01:20:28,120
Just relax and hold on tight.

1027
01:20:28,203 --> 01:20:31,540
Tighter!
Pretend I'm Connie. Ooh!

1028
01:20:33,375 --> 01:20:35,210
Look out! Look out!

1029
01:20:39,923 --> 01:20:42,551
There's no road here.

1030
01:20:44,761 --> 01:20:47,222
No road. Look out!

1031
01:20:59,651 --> 01:21:01,862
Look, there's the mayor.

1032
01:21:01,945 --> 01:21:04,823
Pretty clever of Whirley manoeuvring
him up here to Caesar's party.

1033
01:21:04,907 --> 01:21:07,159
He's got both people
he wants to eliminate in one place.

1034
01:21:07,242 --> 01:21:10,704
Hey, isn't that Whirley's car?

1035
01:21:10,787 --> 01:21:13,207
Good evening, Reverend.

1036
01:21:13,290 --> 01:21:15,167
Child.

1037
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:17,628
I don't see Connie.

1038
01:21:17,711 --> 01:21:22,090
- The next car comes, follow me in.
- Wait. You can't go in there.

1039
01:21:22,174 --> 01:21:25,594
- When did you become Miss Manners?
- First, you don't have a warrant.

1040
01:21:25,677 --> 01:21:29,097
Penal Code 836: A police officer
may make an arrest without a warrant...

1041
01:21:29,181 --> 01:21:31,099
if he believes there's probable cause...

1042
01:21:31,183 --> 01:21:34,061
You're not a police officer any more.

1043
01:21:37,022 --> 01:21:39,775
I hate to be the one to break
that to you, but it's the truth.

1044
01:21:39,858 --> 01:21:42,778
You charge in there now,
you'll never get your badge back.

1045
01:21:42,861 --> 01:21:44,863
Whirley's the only one
that knows where Connie is.

1046
01:21:44,947 --> 01:21:47,241
He'll tell or I'll shove that collar
so far down his throat...

1047
01:21:47,324 --> 01:21:49,243
I'll have to take off his shoes
to wring his neck.

1048
01:21:49,326 --> 01:21:53,330
You're not thinking like a cop any more.
You're thinking like a man in love.

1049
01:21:53,413 --> 01:21:56,041
Watch your language, mister!

1050
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,253
Oh, Joe, I...

1051
01:21:59,336 --> 01:22:02,422
You've never had these feelings before,
have you?

1052
01:22:04,049 --> 01:22:05,968
Almost.

1053
01:22:06,051 --> 01:22:08,303
I had a kitten once.

1054
01:22:08,387 --> 01:22:11,974
This is gonna be a little different.
Connie won't be sleeping in a box...

1055
01:22:12,057 --> 01:22:15,936
or meowing all night
or climbing up your drapes.

1056
01:22:16,019 --> 01:22:20,649
Or maybe she will. You both are sort of
starting from scratch with this thing.

1057
01:22:20,732 --> 01:22:22,317
Get out of my way!

1058
01:22:22,401 --> 01:22:26,905
Last time you went after Whirley, you
got suspended. Now you'll get arrested.

1059
01:22:26,989 --> 01:22:32,119
- On what charge, Junior?
- How about Section 146-A?

1060
01:22:33,370 --> 01:22:37,124
That's right.
Impersonating a police officer.

1061
01:22:38,584 --> 01:22:41,503
It's for your own good, Joe.

1062
01:22:41,587 --> 01:22:44,256
In spite of every logical instinct
I've ever had...

1063
01:22:44,339 --> 01:22:47,259
I consider you a real friend.

1064
01:22:50,762 --> 01:22:53,182
- Wait.
- Joe, go home.

1065
01:22:53,265 --> 01:22:55,267
There's nothing more you can do here.
Believe me.

1066
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:58,270
By the way, my name is Pep.

1067
01:22:59,605 --> 01:23:03,358
It's not mister, junior,
bub or Streebek. It's Pep.

1068
01:23:05,444 --> 01:23:09,156
Friendships start with first names...

1069
01:23:09,239 --> 01:23:10,657
Joe.

1070
01:23:33,806 --> 01:23:36,225
Thank you so much for comin'.

1071
01:23:36,308 --> 01:23:38,852
Your Honour, pleased you could make it.

1072
01:23:38,936 --> 01:23:40,562
You, too, Reverend.

1073
01:23:40,646 --> 01:23:44,316
Let's just drop the fake civility.
Okay, Caesar?

1074
01:23:44,399 --> 01:23:48,195
- You have a cheque for the Reverend.
- I do, all in due time.

1075
01:23:49,363 --> 01:23:52,533
If it would make us all feel better...

1076
01:23:52,616 --> 01:23:55,369
why don't I hold on to it
until the formal presentation?

1077
01:23:57,037 --> 01:23:58,956
Well, whatever.

1078
01:24:06,296 --> 01:24:09,758
You're just in time. We're about
to start our cultural talent show.

1079
01:24:09,842 --> 01:24:11,760
Why don't you pull up a pew next to me?

1080
01:24:11,844 --> 01:24:15,806
Reverend, I'm sure you'll find
these gals socially redeemin'.

1081
01:24:24,690 --> 01:24:27,484
Me me me me

1082
01:24:27,568 --> 01:24:30,404
Me me me
Me me me

1083
01:24:30,487 --> 01:24:34,950
Me me me me me me

1084
01:24:40,372 --> 01:24:44,751
Oh, say can you see

1085
01:24:44,835 --> 01:24:48,630
By the dawn's early light

1086
01:24:49,590 --> 01:24:52,468
How do you like those sweet pipes,
Reverend?

1087
01:24:52,551 --> 01:24:53,969
Surprised?

1088
01:24:54,511 --> 01:24:56,388
Oh, yes.

1089
01:24:56,472 --> 01:24:58,223
Indeed.

1090
01:24:58,307 --> 01:25:02,603
I have a feeling this evening
is going to be full of surprises.

1091
01:25:02,686 --> 01:25:05,272
Through the perilous fight

1092
01:25:59,201 --> 01:26:02,496
Thunderhead to Cloud 9.
Do you read me?

1093
01:26:02,579 --> 01:26:05,582
Our hoses are in place.
Start the gas when ready.

1094
01:26:05,666 --> 01:26:09,169
Cloud 9 to Thunderhead.
We're startin' the gas.

1095
01:26:11,797 --> 01:26:14,550
- Hi. Just need to use the phone.
- Who the hell...

1096
01:26:14,633 --> 01:26:18,846
The White Pages, my favourite. You ever
actually reach out and touch someone?

1097
01:26:26,854 --> 01:26:29,356
See if you can get a line
on the man they work with.

1098
01:26:29,439 --> 01:26:32,818
I'll be hitting Route 30.
Keep me posted.

1099
01:26:33,694 --> 01:26:35,696
- Hello.
- L.A.P.D. Captain Gannon there?

1100
01:26:35,779 --> 01:26:38,699
- Yes, he is. It's work, dear.
- Thank you.

1101
01:26:38,782 --> 01:26:41,243
Thank you, Delilah. Hello.

1102
01:26:41,326 --> 01:26:45,372
- Captain Gannon, this is Streebek.
I'm up at the Caesar mansion. - Streebek?

1103
01:26:45,455 --> 01:26:50,043
I'm surrounded by Pagans. Call out
S.W.A.T. They've got a small army here.

1104
01:27:27,664 --> 01:27:31,543
- Reverend?
- I'll be leaving you in charge, Emil.

1105
01:27:31,627 --> 01:27:34,171
I'll be joining a special passenger...

1106
01:27:34,254 --> 01:27:37,925
aboard my jet for a few
restful days in Acapulco.

1107
01:27:38,008 --> 01:27:40,552
Don't forget to leave a Pagan card...

1108
01:27:40,636 --> 01:27:42,888
so the police and Mr Caesar's
next of kin...

1109
01:27:42,971 --> 01:27:46,892
will give us proper credit
for returning his magazines.

1110
01:27:46,975 --> 01:27:49,686
Oh, and, Emil...

1111
01:27:49,770 --> 01:27:51,772
ever forward.

1112
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:23,095
Police officers! Clear the road.

1113
01:28:31,562 --> 01:28:33,397
"Police officers.

1114
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:35,399
Clear the road."

1115
01:29:00,048 --> 01:29:02,342
- Move it!
- Go! Go! Go! Go!

1116
01:29:07,973 --> 01:29:13,020
What the... Cops! Break out the weapons!
Break out the masks!

1117
01:29:54,144 --> 01:29:56,063
We're pinned down.
Hold your positions!

1118
01:30:10,661 --> 01:30:13,163
All right, boys, let's do it!

1119
01:31:03,672 --> 01:31:05,632
Thank God, it's Friday!

1120
01:31:07,801 --> 01:31:10,929
Hey, everybody, it's me, Pep.
Good to see ya!

1121
01:31:24,985 --> 01:31:27,029
So long, hotshot.

1122
01:31:27,112 --> 01:31:31,783
Muzz, you weren't even born
with the sense God gave the common dog.

1123
01:31:31,867 --> 01:31:33,827
Don't you realize that's my partner?

1124
01:31:33,911 --> 01:31:35,954
Ha-ha!

1125
01:31:43,587 --> 01:31:44,838
Thanks, partner.

1126
01:31:44,922 --> 01:31:48,509
Read him his rights, Pep.

1127
01:31:48,592 --> 01:31:50,010
"Pep"?

1128
01:31:51,303 --> 01:31:53,347
You hear that, Emil?
He called me Pep.

1129
01:31:53,430 --> 01:31:55,682
You have the right to remain silent.

1130
01:31:55,766 --> 01:31:57,810
If you give up the right
to remain silent...

1131
01:31:57,893 --> 01:32:00,103
You know these words.
Come on. Sing along.

1132
01:32:00,187 --> 01:32:03,482
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law

1133
01:32:05,025 --> 01:32:10,697
You got a lifetime subscription
to Bait, Dollies and Field and Cream.

1134
01:32:10,781 --> 01:32:13,492
You saved my house, my gals, my life.

1135
01:32:13,575 --> 01:32:16,495
I'll give you anything you want.
Money, broads, automobiles.

1136
01:32:16,578 --> 01:32:18,539
Anything! Just name it.

1137
01:32:18,622 --> 01:32:20,791
How 'bout takin'
your hands off my suit?

1138
01:32:20,791 --> 01:32:22,084
Absolutely.

1139
01:32:22,167 --> 01:32:24,336
Joe, Jerry, Dona! Ava!

1140
01:32:24,419 --> 01:32:26,922
Whirley's headed to Mexico
in his private jet.

1141
01:32:27,005 --> 01:32:29,424
He's got Connie. Let's move it.

1142
01:32:29,508 --> 01:32:31,635
- Who's Connie?
- I don't know.

1143
01:32:31,718 --> 01:32:33,387
- Wasn't she...
- Never mind. You hungry?

1144
01:32:33,470 --> 01:32:35,389
- Yeah.
- Let's eat.

1145
01:32:36,849 --> 01:32:38,767
Friday, Streebek, good work.

1146
01:32:38,851 --> 01:32:41,186
I'll expect a full report.

1147
01:32:41,270 --> 01:32:44,064
Sure thing. If you'll excuse us,
we have a fugitive to apprehend.

1148
01:32:44,148 --> 01:32:49,278
Wait a minute. I can't let you take
a civilian with you on a hot pursuit.

1149
01:32:49,361 --> 01:32:52,447
- But, Captain, please.
- Sorry, Joe.

1150
01:32:56,994 --> 01:32:59,538
You're gonna need this.

1151
01:33:06,044 --> 01:33:08,213
I didn't have the heart to turn it in.

1152
01:33:10,215 --> 01:33:13,135
Yes, sir.

1153
01:33:14,970 --> 01:33:19,391
Don't just stand there, you petrified
monolith of legal propriety!

1154
01:33:19,475 --> 01:33:21,977
Let's move! I'll drive.

1155
01:33:22,060 --> 01:33:24,897
You seem to be suffering
from selective amnesia.

1156
01:33:24,980 --> 01:33:27,900
I outrank you. I'll drive.

1157
01:33:53,926 --> 01:33:56,470
Be careful. This is a dangerous road.

1158
01:33:56,553 --> 01:34:00,015
When are you worried about my driving,
Mr I-Like-Life-In-The-Fast-Lane?

1159
01:34:04,269 --> 01:34:07,856
- You just flew through a stop sign!
- It felt good.

1160
01:34:09,942 --> 01:34:12,110
Look out for that bump!

1161
01:34:16,782 --> 01:34:20,452
Don't you remember those films
they showed us in high school?

1162
01:34:20,536 --> 01:34:24,832
- Red Asphalt. Blood on the Highway.
- You picked two of my favourites.

1163
01:34:42,808 --> 01:34:44,351
Jonathan.

1164
01:34:45,602 --> 01:34:49,731
I just heard on the police radio
they've stormed the mansion.

1165
01:34:49,815 --> 01:34:53,902
They know everything. It's all over.
We're finished.

1166
01:34:53,986 --> 01:34:57,698
Oh. The girl's aboard, of course?

1167
01:34:57,781 --> 01:35:00,534
Yes, but we might as well let her go.
There's no point in keeping her.

1168
01:35:00,617 --> 01:35:02,911
You're absolutely right.

1169
01:35:02,995 --> 01:35:05,581
Watch for the police.
I'll untie her.

1170
01:35:05,664 --> 01:35:07,249
Be calm.

1171
01:35:07,332 --> 01:35:09,585
Calm. Police.

1172
01:35:18,510 --> 01:35:19,761
Jonathan?

1173
01:35:22,890 --> 01:35:25,434
All buckled up? Good.

1174
01:35:25,517 --> 01:35:26,935
You freak!

1175
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:32,024
- Ah! Freak.
- Don't worry, my dear.

1176
01:35:32,107 --> 01:35:34,276
You'll get used to me in time.

1177
01:35:35,194 --> 01:35:37,112
Jonathan, I think maybe...

1178
01:35:38,530 --> 01:35:40,032
Oh, my God!

1179
01:35:42,367 --> 01:35:44,286
Jonathan!

1180
01:35:48,081 --> 01:35:51,043
Oh, my God! Jonathan!

1181
01:35:55,881 --> 01:35:57,925
Jonathan!

1182
01:36:05,557 --> 01:36:07,851
Come on, Joe. Slow down!

1183
01:36:07,935 --> 01:36:11,063
What happened to those regulations
on high-speed pursuits?

1184
01:36:11,146 --> 01:36:14,358
- I thought you were safety-conscious.
- Close your eyes and think of Christmas.

1185
01:36:17,236 --> 01:36:18,987
Think of Christmas?

1186
01:36:25,410 --> 01:36:28,664
Good King Wenceslaus looked out
on the feast of Stephen

1187
01:36:28,747 --> 01:36:32,334
And the snow lay round about
Deep and crisp and even

1188
01:36:32,417 --> 01:36:36,380
Brightly shone the moon that night
though the frost was cruel

1189
01:36:36,463 --> 01:36:38,048
When the poor man came in sight...

1190
01:36:38,132 --> 01:36:39,842
Try "Silent Night."

1191
01:36:52,563 --> 01:36:55,566
- He's gone. Let's go home.
- No, the runway.

1192
01:37:20,507 --> 01:37:22,092
We lost them.

1193
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:24,386
I have eyes.

1194
01:37:36,523 --> 01:37:38,442
Streebek was right.

1195
01:37:39,902 --> 01:37:41,820
We had lost them.

1196
01:39:57,956 --> 01:39:59,792
Hi, Connie.

1197
01:39:59,875 --> 01:40:02,753
Oh, Joe! I'm so proud.

1198
01:40:07,591 --> 01:40:12,930
What a collar, Joe!
I'm so happy for us. Connie.

1199
01:40:13,013 --> 01:40:17,226
Streebek, isn't there anything
job-related you should be doing now?

1200
01:40:17,309 --> 01:40:18,727
No, nothing.

1201
01:40:22,064 --> 01:40:25,442
I could return our rent-a-wreck...

1202
01:40:25,526 --> 01:40:27,611
and maybe file a report.

1203
01:40:30,697 --> 01:40:32,324
Good...

1204
01:40:32,407 --> 01:40:34,910
because I have a whole lifetime
to catch up on.

1205
01:40:56,598 --> 01:41:01,186
On February 21, a trial was held
in Superior Court...

1206
01:41:01,270 --> 01:41:03,564
in and for the County of Los Angeles.

1207
01:41:03,564 --> 01:41:06,233
The Reverend Jonathan Whirley
was found guilty...

1208
01:41:06,316 --> 01:41:08,402
on two counts of attempted murder...

1209
01:41:08,485 --> 01:41:11,572
kidnapping, arson,
obstruction of justice...

1210
01:41:11,655 --> 01:41:14,032
and tampering
with public utilities.

1211
01:41:14,116 --> 01:41:16,994
He is presently in the men's
correction facility at Chino...

1212
01:41:17,077 --> 01:41:20,873
serving 43 consecutive
99-year sentences...

1213
01:41:20,956 --> 01:41:24,710
which makes him eligible for parole
in seven years.

1214
01:41:25,878 --> 01:41:29,590
Monday, January 12, 8:43 a.m.

1215
01:41:29,673 --> 01:41:33,260
As for Streebek and me, we're back
on day watch at Robbery-Homicide...

1216
01:41:33,343 --> 01:41:37,014
where he still exhibits a blatant
disregard for departmental procedure.

1217
01:41:37,097 --> 01:41:41,226
But I am somehow managing to keep this
in its proper perspective.

1218
01:41:52,154 --> 01:41:55,032
Goodbye, Pep.
Will you be coming over later?

1219
01:41:55,115 --> 01:41:58,869
Yeah, I have to.
I'm wearing your underwear.

1220
01:42:09,463 --> 01:42:11,507
Late night last night, partner?

1221
01:42:11,590 --> 01:42:14,343
I thought the Christian Science
Reading Room closed at 10:00?

1222
01:42:14,426 --> 01:42:17,679
Not that it's any of your business,
Mr National Enquirer...

1223
01:42:17,763 --> 01:42:21,058
but I had the pleasure of spending the
evening in the company of Connie Swail.

1224
01:42:21,141 --> 01:42:23,393
Wait a minute. Connie Swail?

1225
01:42:23,477 --> 01:42:25,896
Don't you mean
the virgin Connie Swail?

1226
01:42:44,998 --> 01:42:47,292
This is the city.
It's a city of crime.

1227
01:42:47,376 --> 01:42:49,628
My name is Friday.
I carry a badge.

1228
01:42:49,711 --> 01:42:52,256
3:15 a.m., Thursday, January 15.

1229
01:42:52,339 --> 01:42:54,550
It was chilly that morning
in the City of Angels.

1230
01:42:54,633 --> 01:42:58,345
On this occasion, we witnessed
a Pagan ritual in progress.

1231
01:43:01,140 --> 01:43:03,600
See that, Streebek
We're just in time

1232
01:43:03,684 --> 01:43:05,686
We have stumbled
into a major crime

1233
01:43:05,769 --> 01:43:08,355
They got the girl all frightened
Now that's not nice

1234
01:43:08,438 --> 01:43:11,024
I think she is the subject
of a sacrifice

1235
01:43:11,108 --> 01:43:13,402
Buddy, we're puttin'
this party on ice

1236
01:43:13,485 --> 01:43:15,946
But first you know we really
oughta read 'em their rights

1237
01:43:16,029 --> 01:43:18,115
Read 'em their rights
Read 'em their rights

1238
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:23,162
Well, I'm here tonight
to rap about your rights

1239
01:43:23,245 --> 01:43:25,164
'Cause right now you're in trouble

1240
01:43:25,247 --> 01:43:28,000
Don't have to say nothin' at all
You all got two calls

1241
01:43:28,083 --> 01:43:30,043
And you better make 'em
on the double

1242
01:43:34,214 --> 01:43:37,509
This is the city of crime

1243
01:43:39,344 --> 01:43:41,638
Don't step outta line

1244
01:43:44,141 --> 01:43:47,811
This is the city of crime

1245
01:43:47,895 --> 01:43:51,482
You better be clean

1246
01:43:52,858 --> 01:43:55,360
You're a dangerous mob
And it is our job

1247
01:43:55,444 --> 01:43:57,738
To bust you all
for being violent

1248
01:43:57,821 --> 01:44:00,157
While we are here
let's state it clear

1249
01:44:00,240 --> 01:44:02,618
You have the right to remain silent

1250
01:44:02,701 --> 01:44:05,162
Well, excuse me, Copper
Mr Crime-Stopper

1251
01:44:05,245 --> 01:44:07,581
What is wrong
with what we're doin'

1252
01:44:07,664 --> 01:44:10,209
We just like to dance
in our goatskin pants

1253
01:44:10,292 --> 01:44:12,211
Around this ancient ruin

1254
01:44:12,294 --> 01:44:14,880
Now it's not so funny
that it cost big money

1255
01:44:14,963 --> 01:44:17,508
If you ever have to hire a lawyer

1256
01:44:17,591 --> 01:44:20,093
It's my duty to inform you
and my pleasure to warn you

1257
01:44:20,177 --> 01:44:22,554
We'll provide one for ya
Huh!

1258
01:44:26,266 --> 01:44:29,728
This is the city of crime

1259
01:44:31,146 --> 01:44:33,690
Don't step outta line

1260
01:44:36,109 --> 01:44:40,614
This is the city of crime

1261
01:44:40,697 --> 01:44:44,868
You're lookin' at 7 to 9

1262
01:44:44,952 --> 01:44:47,204
Now you know what you've been doing
is a serious crime

1263
01:44:47,287 --> 01:44:49,915
And you'll probably be doin'
some serious time

1264
01:44:49,998 --> 01:44:52,376
In case you might be worried
about the friends you'll lose

1265
01:44:52,459 --> 01:44:54,711
At least they get to see you
on the evening news

1266
01:44:54,795 --> 01:44:57,131
It's a new sensation
We go down to the station

1267
01:44:57,214 --> 01:45:00,300
You're gonna answer some questions
And have some refreshments

1268
01:45:00,384 --> 01:45:02,052
What is your full name?

1269
01:45:02,136 --> 01:45:04,555
Well, excuse me
Excuse me

1270
01:45:04,638 --> 01:45:07,057
Don't use, abuse or refuse me

1271
01:45:07,141 --> 01:45:09,518
It's no joke
I'm broke

1272
01:45:09,601 --> 01:45:12,020
But my rights I can and will invoke

1273
01:45:12,104 --> 01:45:14,314
I'm homely and I'm lonely

1274
01:45:14,398 --> 01:45:16,900
But the state cannot disown me

1275
01:45:16,984 --> 01:45:19,570
It ain't funny
I might want money

1276
01:45:19,653 --> 01:45:21,738
To take home to my honey

1277
01:45:25,659 --> 01:45:28,912
This is the city of crime

1278
01:45:30,664 --> 01:45:33,208
Don't step outta line

1279
01:45:35,586 --> 01:45:39,381
This is the city of crime

1280
01:45:39,465 --> 01:45:42,968
Where an honest man is hard to find

1280
01:45:43,305 --> 01:45:49,337
