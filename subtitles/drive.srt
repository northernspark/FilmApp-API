There's a hundred thousand streets in the city.

3
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,487
Now, you give me a time and a place.

4
00:01:52,522 --> 00:01:58,994
I give you a five-minute window,
anything happens in that five minutes and I'm yours...

5
00:01:59,029 --> 00:01:59,995
No matter what.

6
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:06,043
Anything happens in either side of that,
then you are on your own.

7
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,046
Do you understand?

8
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,842
Good.

9
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:19,181
And you won't be able to reach
me on this phone again.

10
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:53,757
Hey, there you are!

11
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,093
She's down there.

12
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,137
Plain Jane boring, just like you asked for.

13
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,808
But, I dropped in 300 horses on the inside,
She's gonna fly.

14
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,894
You look like a zombie kid.
You get any sleep?

15
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,650
Can I offer you some Benzadrine,
Dextradine, Caffeine... Nicotine???

16
00:03:11,685 --> 00:03:15,320
Oh, you don't smoke, that's right.
You're better off.

17
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,448
There she is!

Director wants to see a rollover.

30
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:30,537
You okay with that?

31
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:34,458
Remember, if you don't feel good;
Just abort the shot.

32
00:14:34,493 --> 00:14:35,459
There's no shame in that,
alright?

33
00:14:35,494 --> 00:14:39,296
You're doubling for the star.
It's not like you are A player or anything.

34
00:14:39,331 --> 00:14:41,924
And I got you $500 more. Huh?

35
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:42,925
Of course we split that.

36
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,136
You okay? Ready to go?

37
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:47,804
Alright, I'm counting on you.

38
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:27,845
Oh Kid! That's fantastic.

39
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,846
Just fantastic!

40
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:31,223
Okay, how're you doing?

41
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:34,393
You okay?
Good, that was perfect.

42
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:36,139
Where should I put these?

43
00:17:36,174 --> 00:17:38,016
In the kitchen. Thank you.

44
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:54,199
Scary.

45
00:17:58,162 --> 00:17:59,705
- Hey, You want a tooth-pick?
- Sure.

46
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:08,005
You want a glass of water?

47
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:09,965
Okay.

48
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:21,852
Thanks.

49
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,316
So, did you just moved to L.A?

50
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,612
No, I've been here for a while.

51
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:34,740
- You are just new here?
- Mm-hmm.

52
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:42,873
That's Benicio's father.

53
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,543
Where is he?

54
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,171
He's in prison.

55
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:53,550
What do you do?

56
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:57,513
I drive.

57
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,642
Like a limo driver?

58
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:04,228
No, like for movies.

59
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:09,358
Doing all those car chases and stuff?

60
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:11,610
Yeah.

61
00:19:11,645 --> 00:19:12,611
Isn't that dangerous?

62
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,040
It's only part time.

63
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:29,002
- Mostly I work at the garage.
- Where?

64
00:19:29,037 --> 00:19:31,630
Receda Boulevard.

65
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:41,598
I gotta go.

66
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:45,060
Well, thank you.

67
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:48,605
Thanks for the water.

68
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:50,691
Say bye.

69
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:35,777
Chicken Chow mein?
And, some peking duck.

70
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,362
Where are the chopsticks?

71
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:43,035
- Uh... the guy
- Go get 'em. I don't want that.

72
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:46,455
Chopsticks and a fortune cookie.

73
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:49,291
Put out the fucking cigrette,
I'm eating.

74
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:52,836
- Sorry.
- What's the matter with you?

75
00:20:57,633 --> 00:21:00,969
You run a perfectly good business.
I don't know, why you wanna change that.

76
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:03,931
You know how much
my business made last year?

77
00:21:03,966 --> 00:21:04,932
30 grand.

78
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:10,896
I can build a car in six months and
in six seconds these jerks write it off as a stunt

79
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:12,731
that won't even make it to the movie.

80
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:16,735
See, all I need is a hard used start car.

81
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:18,654
That's all.

82
00:21:18,689 --> 00:21:22,741
I figure we start off small town circuit;
We work our way up.

83
00:21:22,776 --> 00:21:25,494
Once we get to the show,
we are talking millions.

84
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:33,627
So, you still haven't give me your number.

85
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,048
Alright, 430,000 dollars.

86
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,049
Oh!

87
00:21:39,084 --> 00:21:44,304
Mr. Ross, I wouldn't come to you with this.
Unless, I'm absolutely sure about it!

88
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:46,473
How can you be sure, Shannon.

89
00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:49,268
What do you got that
the professional race team don't?

90
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:53,689
I got a driver.

91
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,191
You just told me there're half a dozen drivers.

92
00:21:56,226 --> 00:21:57,192
Not like this one.

93
00:21:58,318 --> 00:21:59,695
This kid is special.

94
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:02,656
Been working with him for a while,
I've never seen anybody like it.

95
00:22:02,691 --> 00:22:05,784
If I had the money,
I'd back him myself.

96
00:22:05,819 --> 00:22:06,785
Yeah, but you don't have the money.

97
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:12,624
Mr. Ross,
you put this kid behind the wheel...

98
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:13,625
There's nothing he cannot do.

99
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:21,049
What are you doing eating
chink food in my fucking restaurant?

100
00:22:21,084 --> 00:22:23,886
What's a Jew doing running a pizzeria?

101
00:22:23,921 --> 00:22:24,887
You remember Shannon?

102
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:30,601
Take a fucking hike.

103
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:32,144
I wanna talk to my partner.

104
00:22:35,314 --> 00:22:36,773
Hah, I'm just fucking with you.

105
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,735
How're you doing Shannon.
How's the fucking leg?

106
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:43,488
I've paid my debt.

107
00:22:43,523 --> 00:22:47,159
I'll think about it. Okay?

108
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:48,994
But I wanna meet the kid first.

109
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:50,996
That's all I ask.

110
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:04,343
C'mon, I want you to meet somebody.

111
00:23:04,378 --> 00:23:07,596
Whatever you do like about the car,
don't say anything.

112
00:23:07,638 --> 00:23:09,223
I want to drive the price down a little bit.

113
00:23:09,258 --> 00:23:11,975
Kid, I want you to meet Mr. Bernie Ross.

114
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:14,645
Nice to meet you.

115
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,735
My hands are a little dirty.

116
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:24,863
So are mine.

117
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:32,287
- Good driving out there.
- Thanks.

118
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:38,168
So? What do you think?

119
00:23:38,203 --> 00:23:39,336
Do we get the 400?

120
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:43,549
I'll give you 300 for 70 percent.

121
00:23:46,385 --> 00:23:47,886
Done!

122
00:23:52,975 --> 00:23:54,476
You won't be sorry!

123
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:14,496
Hey pal, just drop it down here.
We're pushing it alright.

124
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:17,416
We wanna push her into number three.

125
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:19,668
- The car. Not you.
- Oh, good.

126
00:24:19,703 --> 00:24:22,129
- Hi...
- Hi.

127
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:26,258
- Uhh... You two know each other?
- Don't.

128
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,302
Oh, look at that.

129
00:24:28,337 --> 00:24:29,303
- We're neighbours.
- Neighbours, very good.

130
00:24:29,338 --> 00:24:32,472
Well, we'll try to be neighbourly too.

131
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:54,411
You blinked.

132
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:56,371
What?

133
00:24:57,372 --> 00:24:58,457
- Can I call a cab from here.
- Yeah, sure.

134
00:25:01,043 --> 00:25:02,294
What am I talking 'bout.

135
00:25:02,329 --> 00:25:05,672
You and the kid are neighbours, right.
He can take you.

136
00:25:05,707 --> 00:25:07,716
Oh, no.
I feel bad.

137
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:11,261
No, no... Don't even think twice about it.
He'll be happy to do it.

138
00:25:11,296 --> 00:25:12,262
He's a good guy.

139
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,518
You know, he walked into my shop here
about five or six years ago...

140
00:25:17,553 --> 00:25:20,812
right out of the blue,
asking for a job.

141
00:25:20,847 --> 00:25:23,857
So, I put him to the test,
to see what he could do.

142
00:25:25,317 --> 00:25:26,652
The kid is amazing.

143
00:25:26,687 --> 00:25:29,530
So, I hired him on the spot.
Boom!

144
00:25:29,565 --> 00:25:34,076
At about half the wages I normally pay.
He didn't even blink an eye.

145
00:25:34,111 --> 00:25:37,204
Hey kid,
come over here for a sec will you.

146
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:41,041
And I have been exploiting him ever since.

147
00:25:43,502 --> 00:25:44,753
Don't tell him.

148
00:25:44,788 --> 00:25:48,173
Looks like we've bigger problem
than I thought.

149
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:51,301
We're gonna have to keep
the car here for a few days.

150
00:25:51,336 --> 00:25:55,389
So, I offered your services to take,
Benicio and Irene home.

151
00:25:55,424 --> 00:25:56,390
Would that be okay?

152
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:01,812
Yeah, sure.

153
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:07,234
I don't have wheels...
in my car.

154
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:10,445
It's one think you should know about me.

155
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,446
Well put the tyres on.

156
00:26:11,481 --> 00:26:13,949
- You got about five minutes?
- Yeah.

157
00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:38,891
Hey, do you wanna see something?

158
00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:43,854
Yeah.

159
00:26:46,732 --> 00:26:47,900
Okay.

160
00:28:43,182 --> 00:28:46,602
You did good. We had a good time.

161
00:28:55,527 --> 00:28:57,821
Me too.

162
00:29:03,869 --> 00:29:06,330
Sorry, if I put you on the spot or anything.

163
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:07,915
It's okay.

164
00:29:31,939 --> 00:29:33,565
I'm not doing anything this weekend.

165
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:41,365
If you wanna go out or something.

166
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:20,672
Don't worry about these bumps and bruises.
Thats easily replaceable.

167
00:31:20,707 --> 00:31:23,258
We coat a paint on there with sponsors detail.

168
00:31:23,293 --> 00:31:25,761
Look at the thread on the tyre,
still good huh, we are in business.

169
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,766
You paid 300 fucking grand for this piece of shit?

170
00:31:30,801 --> 00:31:32,351
I paid for it.

171
00:31:32,386 --> 00:31:34,478
Out of my own pocket.

172
00:31:34,513 --> 00:31:35,479
This is just the shell.

173
00:31:35,514 --> 00:31:38,273
It's the inside that counts.
Not the outside.

174
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:39,399
Right, Shannon?

175
00:31:39,441 --> 00:31:40,484
You are correct sir.

176
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:43,487
Fuck that shit. If I paid 300 for something.
I want everybody to see it.

177
00:31:43,522 --> 00:31:44,488
Of course you do.

178
00:31:44,523 --> 00:31:46,698
Now this.

179
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:51,453
That is one motherfucking fine ass pussy mobile,
motherfucker!

180
00:31:52,371 --> 00:31:53,580
Damn!

181
00:31:53,622 --> 00:31:55,666
Shannon, sell him that car.

182
00:31:55,701 --> 00:31:59,044
He won't be able to find a pussy
in a whorehouse.

183
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:03,006
You know what?
This car will make you even good looking.

184
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:06,134
How's it going?

185
00:32:09,805 --> 00:32:11,265
When's our first race?

186
00:32:13,809 --> 00:32:14,935
Uhh, pretty soon.

187
00:32:16,395 --> 00:32:17,688
You gonna be ready?

188
00:32:19,773 --> 00:32:21,149
I hope so.

189
00:32:21,184 --> 00:32:22,150
Huh... I hope so.

190
00:32:22,185 --> 00:32:26,029
Hey no false modesty.
I got a lot of money on this.

191
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:30,117
Did Shannon ever tell you how we met?

192
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:35,164
I used to produce movies.

193
00:32:35,199 --> 00:32:36,165
In the 80's.

194
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,169
Kinda like action films and sexy stuff.

195
00:32:40,204 --> 00:32:41,170
One critic called them 'European'.

196
00:32:41,205 --> 00:32:44,131
I thought they were shit.

197
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:46,550
Anyway he arrange all the cars for me.
Did all the stunts.

198
00:32:46,585 --> 00:32:50,137
I liked him. I like having him around.

199
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:52,514
Eventhough, he'd overcharge the shit out of me.

200
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:56,268
His next business venture.

201
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,729
He got involved with some of Nino's friends.

202
00:32:58,764 --> 00:32:59,730
They didn't go for the overcharging bit.

203
00:33:01,523 --> 00:33:03,025
They broke his pelvis.

204
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,402
He's never had a lot of luck.

205
00:33:07,905 --> 00:33:11,450
The reason I'm telling you this is,
He's got a lot invested in you.

206
00:33:11,492 --> 00:33:12,951
So do I.

207
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:16,288
So. You need anything...
You call me.

208
00:33:16,323 --> 00:33:19,208
We're a team now.

209
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,670
I'm excited.
Let's get out of here.

210
00:33:25,547 --> 00:33:26,715
Nino.

211
00:33:42,147 --> 00:33:44,107
- You see the bad guy?
- Yeah.

212
00:33:44,142 --> 00:33:45,108
How can you tell?

213
00:33:47,945 --> 00:33:49,905
'Cos he's a shark.

214
00:33:51,532 --> 00:33:52,616
There's no good shark?

215
00:33:53,492 --> 00:33:55,953
No... I mean, just look at him.

216
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,664
Does he look like a good guy to you?

217
00:34:52,217 --> 00:34:53,719
That was my husband's lawyer.

218
00:34:55,304 --> 00:34:56,930
He's coming home in a week.

219
00:36:21,557 --> 00:36:24,977
You know, we're here celebrating.
Its a shameful thing...

220
00:36:26,937 --> 00:36:28,105
what I did.

221
00:36:29,565 --> 00:36:32,860
And I have a lot of making up to do,
to everyone.

222
00:36:38,824 --> 00:36:40,909
But second chances are rare.

223
00:36:40,951 --> 00:36:43,036
Right?

224
00:36:44,413 --> 00:36:46,373
And that's worth celebrating.
Right?

225
00:36:49,126 --> 00:36:53,046
So, I want to make a toast.
To that lady right there.

226
00:36:54,798 --> 00:36:58,677
Thanks for staying.
I love you, Inny.

227
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:01,346
Salud.

228
00:38:13,252 --> 00:38:14,336
Hey?

229
00:38:16,004 --> 00:38:17,381
Hi.

230
00:38:25,097 --> 00:38:26,807
Sorry about the noise.

231
00:38:30,936 --> 00:38:32,437
I was gonna call the cops.

232
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:37,109
I wish you would.

233
00:38:41,238 --> 00:38:42,823
You're getting heavier.

234
00:38:47,661 --> 00:38:53,250
- Hey, how are you doing?
- Hi.

235
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:55,252
This guy has been telling a lot about you.

236
00:38:57,171 --> 00:38:59,089
He says, you've been coming around and
helping out a lot.

237
00:39:00,674 --> 00:39:02,759
Yeah? Helping out.
Is that right?

238
00:39:05,053 --> 00:39:06,263
Is that right?

239
00:39:09,766 --> 00:39:11,351
That's very nice.
That's nice of you.

240
00:39:11,393 --> 00:39:13,437
- Than you.
- You're welcome.

241
00:39:17,774 --> 00:39:19,234
- You drive for the movies?
- Yeah.

242
00:39:23,572 --> 00:39:25,365
- I can take that.
- No, no. I got it.

243
00:39:29,661 --> 00:39:31,663
Let mommy talk to her friend.

244
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:54,728
You have a good night.

245
00:40:32,474 --> 00:40:33,892
You're Shannon's buddy, Right?

246
00:40:36,979 --> 00:40:38,105
We met last year.

247
00:40:39,815 --> 00:40:41,942
You drove me and my brother
back from palm springs.

248
00:40:46,655 --> 00:40:48,365
We hired another wing man.

249
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,743
I spend six months in jail and
my brother got himself killed.

250
00:40:56,748 --> 00:40:58,000
I've got a sweet job coming up.

251
00:40:58,035 --> 00:40:59,001
How about this?

252
00:40:59,036 --> 00:41:00,002
You shut you mouth.

253
00:41:00,037 --> 00:41:04,339
Or I'll kick your teeth down
your throat and i'll shut it for you.

254
00:41:12,973 --> 00:41:14,516
Nice seeing you again.

255
00:42:32,845 --> 00:42:34,054
Come here.

256
00:42:35,514 --> 00:42:36,557
Don't be scared.

257
00:42:38,892 --> 00:42:41,687
Look, don't tell mommy. Okay?

258
00:42:44,982 --> 00:42:46,984
Okay, it's a secret between us boys.

259
00:42:49,653 --> 00:42:50,821
Oh, fuck.

260
00:43:51,298 --> 00:43:52,758
Who are they?

261
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:56,386
What the fuck are you gonna do?
You gonna go and beat them out for me?

262
00:43:56,421 --> 00:43:58,680
Huh, stunt guy.

263
00:44:00,516 --> 00:44:02,351
Why the fuck do you
wanna know who they are?

264
00:44:14,988 --> 00:44:18,200
There's some guy who want me to do a job for him,
But I'm not gonna do it.

265
00:44:23,664 --> 00:44:24,998
What's the job?

266
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:28,377
He want me to rob a pawn shop in the valley.

267
00:44:30,963 --> 00:44:32,047
Why?

268
00:44:33,131 --> 00:44:35,259
'Cos I owe them protection money,
for when I was in the inside.

269
00:44:35,294 --> 00:44:36,260
It's two thousand bucks.

270
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,561
And as soon as I got out.

271
00:44:39,596 --> 00:44:42,975
Oh, it's 5,000 bucks.
Oh, it's actually 10,000 dollars.

272
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:45,769
20,000 dollars,
tomorrow I don't know what it's gonna be.

273
00:44:49,147 --> 00:44:50,149
What are you gonna do?

274
00:44:51,525 --> 00:44:53,152
That's a very good question.

275
00:44:56,363 --> 00:44:58,907
They said they're gonna come after
Benicio and Irene next.

276
00:45:22,139 --> 00:45:23,432
You okay?

277
00:45:25,267 --> 00:45:26,560
You want something to drink?

278
00:45:30,981 --> 00:45:32,524
What's that you got there?

279
00:45:35,402 --> 00:45:36,695
Can I see?

280
00:45:50,334 --> 00:45:51,835
- One of those man gave you this?
- Mmm-hm.

281
00:45:54,713 --> 00:45:56,006
They told me not to loose it.

282
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:02,721
You want me to keep this for you?

283
00:46:03,889 --> 00:46:04,932
Okay.

284
00:46:30,082 --> 00:46:31,333
- How's Benice?
- Good.

285
00:46:37,089 --> 00:46:38,632
You just saying that?

286
00:46:40,342 --> 00:46:43,428
No, what do you mean?

287
00:46:47,558 --> 00:46:50,060
I saw that Standard...

288
00:46:50,102 --> 00:46:52,104
was in an accident.

289
00:46:52,139 --> 00:46:53,397
Yeah.

290
00:46:57,734 --> 00:46:59,111
What happened?

291
00:47:03,031 --> 00:47:04,366
He got beat up.

292
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:09,830
Why?

293
00:47:11,582 --> 00:47:13,041
Just drunk kids.

294
00:47:25,429 --> 00:47:26,471
You should come over.

295
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:30,976
You should come and see him.

296
00:47:38,817 --> 00:47:39,860
You wanna...

297
00:47:39,902 --> 00:47:42,488
You wanna hear a story?

298
00:47:42,523 --> 00:47:44,865
- You wanna hear how mommy and me met?
- Yeah.

299
00:47:48,243 --> 00:47:49,411
We're at a pary.

300
00:47:50,621 --> 00:47:51,997
And she was nineteen years old.

301
00:47:52,032 --> 00:47:53,624
Seventeen.

302
00:47:53,659 --> 00:47:54,625
- You're not seventeen.
- I was.

303
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:57,044
Wow, so that's illegal.

304
00:47:59,671 --> 00:48:04,343
Alright, so I illegally walked over
to a seventeen year old girl.

305
00:48:05,469 --> 00:48:06,595
I walked up and I say...

306
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,931
"Hello Miss"

307
00:48:10,265 --> 00:48:11,475
What is your name?

308
00:48:12,684 --> 00:48:14,228
And she didn't say anything.

309
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:16,814
And I said, well...
My name's Standard Gabriel.

310
00:48:16,849 --> 00:48:19,149
Then what did you said.

311
00:48:24,613 --> 00:48:25,823
I said...

312
00:48:27,533 --> 00:48:29,159
"Where's the deluxe version"

313
00:48:39,586 --> 00:48:41,129
Oh, man, that killed me.

314
00:48:45,425 --> 00:48:47,135
And then a year later,
you popped out man.

315
00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:55,686
Best day of my life.

316
00:49:45,194 --> 00:49:46,236
Where we're going afterwards.

317
00:49:46,271 --> 00:49:48,780
I give you a five-minutes when we get there.

318
00:49:49,781 --> 00:49:52,326
Anything happens in that five minutes
and I'm yours no matter what.

319
00:49:52,361 --> 00:49:53,327
Anything a minute either side of that...

320
00:49:53,362 --> 00:49:55,913
then you are on your own.

321
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,499
I don't sit in while you're running it down;

322
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:00,459
I don't carry a gun...

323
00:50:01,418 --> 00:50:02,669
I drive.

324
00:50:02,961 --> 00:50:04,338
You look like you are hard to work with.

325
00:50:05,964 --> 00:50:07,257
Not as long as we understand each other.

326
00:50:09,176 --> 00:50:10,511
What's there to understand?

327
00:50:10,552 --> 00:50:12,304
I cannot do this thing alone.

328
00:50:12,339 --> 00:50:13,305
You got Blanche.

329
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:14,306
C'mon man.

330
00:50:17,351 --> 00:50:18,644
She's beautiful,
Look at her.

331
00:50:21,939 --> 00:50:23,482
What the fuck are you rolling your eyes at for?

332
00:50:26,193 --> 00:50:27,319
You know get the fuck out of here.

333
00:50:27,361 --> 00:50:28,445
Get up!

334
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,948
Standard, take her with you,
and go get her a fucking coke.

335
00:50:38,372 --> 00:50:39,331
Okay, here's the deal.

336
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:43,001
This much for Blanche,

337
00:50:45,504 --> 00:50:48,090
This much for that asshole...
Minus what he owes me.

338
00:50:50,008 --> 00:50:51,718
And this much for you.

339
00:50:56,056 --> 00:50:57,349
You're still interested?

340
00:50:59,935 --> 00:51:00,811
Good!

341
00:51:00,846 --> 00:51:01,812
Anything else?

342
00:51:03,939 --> 00:51:05,399
When you get your money,

343
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,692
His debt's paid.

344
00:51:06,727 --> 00:51:07,693
His out for good.

345
00:51:09,653 --> 00:51:11,238
You never go near his family ever again.

346
00:51:13,157 --> 00:51:14,408
Do you understand?

347
00:51:18,871 --> 00:51:20,247
To my family.

348
00:51:20,289 --> 00:51:21,790
To my new friend.

349
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:27,296
And toast to the future.

350
00:51:30,215 --> 00:51:31,216
Our future.

351
00:51:56,408 --> 00:51:57,493
I'll see you in five minutes.

352
00:52:04,458 --> 00:52:05,459
See you in four.

353
00:56:44,905 --> 00:56:46,532
How much did Cook said,
we're gonna get?

354
00:56:50,619 --> 00:56:51,703
40 grand.

355
00:57:00,838 --> 00:57:01,797
Stay here.

356
00:57:21,608 --> 00:57:23,193
When was the last time you saw your husband?

357
00:57:27,573 --> 00:57:29,491
Can you answer... the question?

358
00:57:39,835 --> 00:57:40,586
Hello?

359
00:57:40,627 --> 00:57:42,379
Benicio, is that you?

360
00:57:42,414 --> 00:57:43,380
Yeah.

361
00:57:46,884 --> 00:57:47,968
Your mother there?

362
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:52,723
Uh, she's sitting down...
talking to a police.

363
00:57:54,183 --> 00:57:56,810
Okay, just tell her I'm gonna call her back.
Okay?

364
00:57:56,852 --> 00:57:58,812
Okay, bye.

365
00:58:10,449 --> 00:58:12,493
<i>He's been identified as Standard Gabriel,</i>

366
00:58:14,536 --> 00:58:16,830
<i>Other details are unclear but...</i>

367
00:58:16,872 --> 00:58:20,167
<i>the owner of the pawn shop, told the reporter
that Gabriel acted alone.</i>

368
00:58:20,459 --> 00:58:22,711
<i>And that, the items he had stolen
has been recovered.</i>

369
00:58:45,859 --> 00:58:47,319
If he saw you take the money...

370
00:58:49,029 --> 00:58:50,656
and saw you get in the car;

371
00:58:53,367 --> 00:58:54,868
Then why didn't they say anything?

372
00:58:57,037 --> 00:58:58,330
I have no idea.

373
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:12,469
Did you have any idea that
there would be a second car?

374
00:59:17,933 --> 00:59:20,018
I already told you, I didn't.

375
00:59:26,108 --> 00:59:28,152
Now, you've just got
a little boy's father killed.

376
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:31,155
And you almost got us killed.

377
00:59:32,447 --> 00:59:34,032
And now, you are lying to me.

378
00:59:34,067 --> 00:59:36,160
So, how about this?

379
00:59:37,744 --> 00:59:43,083
From now on,
every words out of your mouth is the truth.

380
00:59:44,126 --> 00:59:45,627
Or I'm gonna hurt you.

381
00:59:47,379 --> 00:59:49,047
Do you understand?

382
00:59:50,215 --> 00:59:51,967
Now, what did Cook tell you?

383
00:59:53,635 --> 00:59:55,762
He said there'd be another car hold us up.

384
00:59:55,797 --> 00:59:58,348
But he didn't say anything about all these money.

385
00:59:58,383 --> 01:00:01,602
He didn't say anything about anyone
getting killed.

386
01:00:02,936 --> 01:00:04,563
And he was gonna rip us off?

387
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:13,322
What's his real name?

388
01:00:13,363 --> 01:00:15,782
He said it's Chris...
But I just call him Cook.

389
01:00:21,121 --> 01:00:24,208
You're gonna take me to him...
Right now.

390
01:00:26,668 --> 01:00:27,961
Do you understand?

391
01:00:27,996 --> 01:00:30,380
Yeah.

392
01:03:56,837 --> 01:03:59,298
This guy Cook,
he have a real name?

393
01:03:59,333 --> 01:04:01,800
Chris.

394
01:04:03,719 --> 01:04:04,970
Maybe.

395
01:04:07,389 --> 01:04:09,933
I'll ask Bernie,
see if he knows him.

396
01:04:12,436 --> 01:04:14,062
Jesus!
I can't stop thinking about...

397
01:04:14,097 --> 01:04:15,689
what we could do with all that dough.

398
01:04:15,724 --> 01:04:17,316
- Would you stop?
- Alright!

399
01:04:17,351 --> 01:04:19,568
You know, a lot of guys messing around
with married women...

400
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:23,155
but you're the only one I know who robs a joint,
to pay back the husband.

401
01:04:24,323 --> 01:04:25,282
Crazy!

402
01:04:26,366 --> 01:04:27,284
Don't worry about it.

403
01:04:27,326 --> 01:04:29,077
I'll take care of it.

404
01:05:00,984 --> 01:05:02,194
Where's Cook?

405
01:05:02,229 --> 01:05:03,529
He's in the dressing room.

406
01:05:04,947 --> 01:05:06,031
Where's that?

407
01:05:07,491 --> 01:05:08,659
It's over there.

408
01:05:28,428 --> 01:05:29,763
You're a fucking dead man.

409
01:05:38,814 --> 01:05:40,023
Whose money do I have?

410
01:05:41,692 --> 01:05:43,277
Don't worry...
they're gonna come and get it.

411
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:47,698
Call them.

412
01:05:47,739 --> 01:05:49,366
Somebody call Nino.

413
01:06:01,587 --> 01:06:02,588
Do you remember this?

414
01:06:27,321 --> 01:06:28,113
Hello?

415
01:06:29,698 --> 01:06:30,449
Nino?

416
01:06:30,491 --> 01:06:33,410
No, sorry pal.
Why don't you call back later, we're closed.

417
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:37,372
I could, but I think Nino would be upset
that you made him wait.

418
01:06:39,082 --> 01:06:40,459
Can I ask what this is about?

419
01:06:40,494 --> 01:06:43,128
I have something of his.

420
01:06:44,463 --> 01:06:45,714
And that would be?

421
01:06:46,965 --> 01:06:48,467
A million dollars.

422
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:51,136
Please hold.

423
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:00,521
Nino: You have something that
fucking belongs to me.

424
01:07:06,568 --> 01:07:07,611
Seems that way.

425
01:07:10,864 --> 01:07:13,158
And you're calling me...

426
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,535
Why?

427
01:07:16,537 --> 01:07:18,455
You're expecting to buy my own shit back from you?

428
01:07:18,497 --> 01:07:19,873
I'm not selling it.

429
01:07:19,915 --> 01:07:23,585
I'm gonna give you a time and place,
and you're gonna come and get it.

430
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:25,879
Do you Understand?

431
01:07:28,048 --> 01:07:29,174
What are you getting out of it?

432
01:07:30,843 --> 01:07:31,760
Just that.

433
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:34,555
"Out of it."

434
01:07:35,931 --> 01:07:37,182
And your partners are happy with that?

435
01:07:39,685 --> 01:07:40,978
I don't have any partners.

436
01:07:42,896 --> 01:07:46,066
You discuss this with anybody else?

437
01:07:47,901 --> 01:07:49,027
No, just with you.

438
01:07:50,946 --> 01:07:52,823
You're not very good at this.
Are you?

439
01:08:46,335 --> 01:08:47,628
Can I talk to you for a minute?

440
01:08:49,713 --> 01:08:51,173
I can't talk, I have to go.

441
01:08:54,676 --> 01:08:56,345
Can I just walk with you... for?

442
01:09:18,242 --> 01:09:19,326
I have to tell you something.

443
01:09:26,375 --> 01:09:28,460
Standard was into some...

444
01:09:28,495 --> 01:09:32,881
guys in prison for a lot of money.

445
01:09:35,425 --> 01:09:38,053
And it would ruin you and benicio
if he wouldn't pay it.

446
01:09:42,099 --> 01:09:43,559
He asked me for my help.

447
01:09:47,688 --> 01:09:49,565
It just went wrong, you know.

448
01:09:53,152 --> 01:09:54,069
I'm sorry.

449
01:09:59,825 --> 01:10:00,909
I still got the money.

450
01:10:05,664 --> 01:10:07,374
You can have it, if you wanted to.

451
01:10:10,752 --> 01:10:12,462
You can take Benicio... and.

452
01:10:24,391 --> 01:10:26,685
I just thought,
we could get out of here. If you wanted.

453
01:10:30,689 --> 01:10:31,815
I could come with you.

454
01:10:36,403 --> 01:10:37,863
I could look out for you.

455
01:10:43,285 --> 01:10:45,787
Sorry... uh... wrong floor.

456
01:14:10,284 --> 01:14:11,618
He came into my apartment, Shannon.

457
01:14:14,121 --> 01:14:15,414
How did they know where I live?

458
01:14:18,458 --> 01:14:19,209
I told you,
I was gonna call Bernie.

459
01:14:19,668 --> 01:14:20,669
I just want him know that...

460
01:14:20,711 --> 01:14:23,839
that it wasn't about that,
you are not interested in the money.

461
01:14:24,006 --> 01:14:25,007
And that you just did it for the girl.

462
01:14:34,057 --> 01:14:36,101
You told him about Irene!!!

463
01:14:40,772 --> 01:14:43,442
I just wanted him to know that...

464
01:14:43,477 --> 01:14:46,737
as soon as you return the money,
that was the end of it.

465
01:14:46,987 --> 01:14:49,907
I didn't know.
How was I suppose to know that?

466
01:14:50,073 --> 01:14:51,408
Okay?

467
01:14:52,284 --> 01:14:53,577
Look, let me just talk to Bernie...
Okay?

468
01:14:55,704 --> 01:14:57,998
Why did you have to fuck everything up, Shannon?

469
01:14:59,541 --> 01:15:00,542
How was I suppose to know that?

470
01:15:07,633 --> 01:15:08,509
They're gonna come looking for me.

471
01:15:08,675 --> 01:15:09,718
And they're gonna come for you.

472
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:11,845
Do you understand?

473
01:15:12,054 --> 01:15:14,264
You gotta get out of here.

474
01:15:14,299 --> 01:15:15,432
And you gotta get out now.

475
01:15:17,476 --> 01:15:19,895
Listen to me.
Listen to me, Shannon.

476
01:15:21,855 --> 01:15:23,774
You get out of here and you never fucking come back.

477
01:15:25,734 --> 01:15:27,236
You never come back.

478
01:15:33,325 --> 01:15:34,618
What are you gonna do?

479
01:15:52,136 --> 01:15:53,762
I already gave you my advice.

480
01:15:55,055 --> 01:15:57,558
You should've taken the money,
and left the guy alone.

481
01:15:57,599 --> 01:15:58,934
It's just not that simple Bernie.

482
01:15:58,976 --> 01:16:01,645
No! Of course not!
Now everything's bounced up in your face!

483
01:16:02,479 --> 01:16:05,149
You know, I owe you this guy.
Just give me a little time and I'll get rid of him.

484
01:16:05,190 --> 01:16:07,359
Shut the fuck up.

485
01:16:07,401 --> 01:16:09,444
You fucking monkey!

486
01:16:10,445 --> 01:16:14,741
The money, belongs to some half-assed wise guy,
out of Philly. Now...

487
01:16:14,776 --> 01:16:15,909
I got tipped off...

488
01:16:15,951 --> 01:16:19,705
he was stashing a million bucks in a pawn shop;
He's gonna invest it here in L.A.

489
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:22,082
He was gonna set up a rival operation.

490
01:16:22,124 --> 01:16:24,751
So, you stole from the east-coast mob?

491
01:16:24,786 --> 01:16:27,296
No! I stole from some jump up punk.

492
01:16:28,088 --> 01:16:29,840
He was trying to step on our action.

493
01:16:29,875 --> 01:16:33,886
Yeah... then why didn't you come to me,
before you set up this dummy robbery?

494
01:16:35,804 --> 01:16:37,389
Before you hire this piece of shit.

495
01:16:37,431 --> 01:16:40,642
This was something on the side, Bernie.
I didn't wanna involve you on this.

496
01:16:40,684 --> 01:16:42,227
Well, I'm involved now!

497
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:46,106
Let me tell you something...

498
01:16:46,148 --> 01:16:53,864
If anybody finds out you stole
from the family, we are both dead.

499
01:16:54,490 --> 01:16:55,741
What fucking family?

500
01:16:57,117 --> 01:16:59,328
The family who still calls me a fucking kike?

501
01:17:00,954 --> 01:17:02,289
To my face!

502
01:17:03,707 --> 01:17:08,545
You know, I'm fifty nine years old Bernie,
they still pinched my cheek like I'm some fucking kid.

503
01:17:10,589 --> 01:17:11,548
Family.

504
01:17:11,583 --> 01:17:14,343
The money flows up, easy.

505
01:17:14,378 --> 01:17:16,261
You know that.

506
01:17:17,638 --> 01:17:19,389
That's why this driver's gotta go, Bernie.

507
01:17:21,225 --> 01:17:22,059
He's gotta go.

508
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:24,186
And your pal, Shannon.

509
01:17:24,228 --> 01:17:27,689
It's these two guys,
that can tie me to this robbery.

510
01:18:07,896 --> 01:18:10,107
Now, it's your turn to clean up after me.

511
01:19:14,379 --> 01:19:16,048
All this priceless cars...

512
01:19:16,089 --> 01:19:18,258
One would think you'd have better locks.

513
01:19:22,888 --> 01:19:24,181
Doors is always open to you.

514
01:19:24,223 --> 01:19:26,058
Going somewhere?

515
01:19:32,189 --> 01:19:33,607
I was thinking about it.

516
01:19:35,067 --> 01:19:36,693
I'm looking for your driver.

517
01:19:39,154 --> 01:19:41,490
You breaking in here,
I figure its bad news.

518
01:19:41,532 --> 01:19:42,866
No, Shannon.

519
01:19:42,908 --> 01:19:44,701
It's bad luck.

520
01:19:45,661 --> 01:19:49,122
Two thousand heist a year in this city,

521
01:19:49,157 --> 01:19:51,250
he has to pick the wrong one.

522
01:19:52,292 --> 01:19:53,460
He tried to put it right.

523
01:19:53,502 --> 01:19:55,712
Well, he picked the wrong guy for that too.

524
01:19:55,754 --> 01:19:59,800
My partner is a belligerent asshole,
with his back against the wall.

525
01:20:01,385 --> 01:20:02,678
Right now, so am I.

526
01:20:03,971 --> 01:20:06,181
If I don't set this straight,
I'm in big trouble.

527
01:20:10,227 --> 01:20:12,104
Any idea where he might be?

528
01:20:15,732 --> 01:20:16,817
Mexico.

529
01:20:16,852 --> 01:20:19,611
Or maybe it was Balise.

530
01:20:23,115 --> 01:20:24,241
Really?

531
01:20:31,123 --> 01:20:33,542
I was excited about this whole thing.

532
01:20:34,543 --> 01:20:36,044
My name on a car!

533
01:20:37,129 --> 01:20:38,922
I mean, look how beautiful.

534
01:20:40,090 --> 01:20:42,301
I wanted to see my name on this thing.

535
01:20:44,970 --> 01:20:47,055
I think we would've made a go with this business.

536
01:21:03,197 --> 01:21:04,031
Don't worry.

537
01:21:04,072 --> 01:21:05,032
Don't worry.

538
01:21:05,067 --> 01:21:05,866
That's it.

539
01:21:05,901 --> 01:21:09,536
It's done.
There is no pain, its over. Its over.

540
01:28:41,864 --> 01:28:43,824
I think this has gone on long enough.

541
01:28:45,617 --> 01:28:47,744
You see any reason for this to continue?

542
01:28:49,872 --> 01:28:51,582
What do you say we meet?

543
01:28:54,877 --> 01:28:56,378
Why would I wanna do that?

544
01:28:57,963 --> 01:28:58,755
Well...

545
01:28:58,797 --> 01:29:02,509
You, me and your girlfriend
are the only players left.

546
01:29:02,551 --> 01:29:04,761
How's that for a reason?

547
01:29:07,264 --> 01:29:08,182
When?

548
01:29:09,224 --> 01:29:10,267
Tomorrow.

549
01:29:11,602 --> 01:29:12,769
There's a place on Sherman Way...

550
01:29:12,811 --> 01:29:15,022
there's a restaurant called "The Great Wall".

551
01:29:15,063 --> 01:29:15,898
You know it?

552
01:29:16,857 --> 01:29:18,108
I'll find it.

553
01:29:45,052 --> 01:29:46,303
Can I talk to you?

554
01:29:49,556 --> 01:29:50,933
I won't keep you long.

555
01:29:56,188 --> 01:29:58,023
I have to go somewhere now.
I don't think I can come back.

556
01:30:10,369 --> 01:30:14,414
Just getting to be around you...
was the best thing that ever happened to me.

557
01:31:06,925 --> 01:31:08,218
Did you bring the money?

558
01:31:14,808 --> 01:31:16,351
Here's what I'm prepared to offer...

559
01:31:17,644 --> 01:31:19,480
You give me the money,
the girl is safe.

560
01:31:20,606 --> 01:31:23,775
Forever, nobody knows about it.
She's off the limits.

561
01:31:26,028 --> 01:31:27,863
I can't offer you the same.

562
01:31:29,490 --> 01:31:31,158
So, this is what I would suggest.

563
01:31:32,618 --> 01:31:34,453
We conclude our deals...
we shake hands.

564
01:31:35,829 --> 01:31:37,789
You'll start the rest of you life.

565
01:31:40,709 --> 01:31:44,588
Any dreams you have,
plans or hopes for the future;

566
01:31:44,630 --> 01:31:47,591
I think you got to put that on holds.

567
01:31:49,259 --> 01:31:51,553
For the rest of your life,
you're gonna be looking over your shoulder.

568
01:31:51,595 --> 01:31:55,766
I'm just telling you this,
'cos I want you to know the truth.

569
01:31:57,601 --> 01:31:58,936
But the girl is safe.

570
01:31:59,305 --> 01:32:05,606
