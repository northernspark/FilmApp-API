{2638}{2724}The big story at Miami's Grand Prix|is the second-place finish...
{2729}{2765}...of rookie Jimmy Bly.
{2823}{2878}-Where's he from?|-Racing's new heartthrob.
{2956}{3015}-Second place in England.|-A contender.
{3059}{3084}Bly is a natural.
{3125}{3178}We're in Rio for race six.
{3204}{3267}A surprise win for rookie|Jimmy Bly.
{3314}{3363}Brandenburg's first season loss.
{3368}{3440}A second incredible upset.|Bly wins in Michigan.
{3445}{3476}Brandenburg loses.
{3513}{3569}We're down under for the 11th race.
{3611}{3659}Brandenburg's lost three in a row.
{3701}{3765}Bly and Brandenburg are tied|for the championship.
{3807}{3837}Bly looks nervous.
{3841}{3906}-Cracks are showing.|-Part of being a rookie.
{3910}{4006}It'll be interesting to see how long|this young man can keep this up.
{5021}{5113}Hey, DeMille, you promised|a sound bite for tonight's sports!
{5120}{5189}Jimmy, only talk to this woman.|This reporter only.
{5740}{5794}DeMille, can we call it?
{5807}{5854}Wait a minute. Come here.
{5865}{5913}Think. Let me explain something.
{5918}{6028}These people love you and buy tickets.|The ones with cameras help sell them.
{6033}{6086}-l need to focus on tomorrow.|-lt is tomorrow.
{6095}{6131}This is part of the game.
{6134}{6215}ln five years, when you're|a brand name, you'll thank me.
{7173}{7254}Beau, you've had problems before|and never acted like this.
{7283}{7315}Things change.
{7331}{7389}Why can't you just respect|what l need?
{7454}{7506}A bad season, so l'm|out of your life?
{7511}{7543}This is my life!
{7555}{7609}This is not your life!
{7679}{7726}This is what you do for a living.
{7754}{7853}Look, if l'm going to win...
{7861}{7971}...l need my mind there, not here.|Right now this is my life.
{8027}{8062}This is your life.
{8195}{8233}What am l?
{8352}{8384}What am l?
{8425}{8461}A distraction.
{8508}{8541}l'm sorry.
{9644}{9703}We're in lap 193|of this 225-lap race.
{9709}{9792}The defending world champion,|Beau Brandenburg, is in first...
{9798}{9894}...driving better than we've|seen him drive all season long.
{9910}{9986}Christian Fittipaldi|sits in second place.
{10007}{10083}And the young rookie, Jimmy Bly,|sits back in third.
{10088}{10145}Bly's been shaky|for the last few races.
{10151}{10221}He's such a promising star,|just got raw talent.
{10227}{10290}If Carl Henry could|get him to relax...
{10336}{10400}...there'll be no stopping him.
{10429}{10498}Laps wind down.|It's a tight panel at the front.
{10567}{10652}Bly tries to make his move|on the number 11 of Fittipaldi.
{10658}{10717}Motorola car comes to the inside.
{10834}{10901}And he does it!|Sweet pass by the rookie, Bly.
{10905}{10943}Great. You're doing great.
{10966}{11048}Close on Brandenburg?|Everybody wants to know that.
{11058}{11167}Bly really seems to be having a|problem with consistency and focus.
{11173}{11249}Even so, he now finds himself|in second place.
{11303}{11369}With just 10 laps to go,|Brandenburg leads.
{11374}{11434}You're looking good.|Right there.
{11477}{11565}Brandenburg's experience shows.|He knows how to take the corners.
{11570}{11655}Jimmy Bly coming into the corner|has a tendency to slow down.
{11711}{11803}-A lot of pressure on young Bly.|-Pass for chrissake!
{11808}{11842}What is he afraid of?
{11848}{11921}Follow Brandenburg's line.|Are you following his line?
{11931}{11989}I can't. Can I pick another line?
{11993}{12037}Take Brandenburg's line.
{12056}{12135}Bly drafts up into the vacuum|behind Brandenburg's car.
{12141}{12236}But every time he steps out of that|vacuum he runs into a wall of air.
{12241}{12344}-Slows him down and affects momentum.|-Lay it out, Jimmy. Lay it out.
{12356}{12441}You better win this thing.|Win it or you'll look like a fool.
{12503}{12581}Bly down to the inside,|tries to get alongside him!
{12586}{12655}Very, very close as they|come off the corner.
{12928}{13006}Can Bly get past him here?|It's gonna be close.
{13037}{13086}Son of a bitch, not again.|He's gone.
{13101}{13175}Bly makes his move,|nails the throttle.
{13231}{13278}They touch and Bly's in trouble!
{13282}{13356}Can he keep it off the wall?|He slides to the inside.
{13361}{13441}Bly's spinning out of control.
{13834}{13869}Damn it!
{13876}{13961}And it gives the win over|to the defending world champion.
{13969}{14054}This is Beau Brandenburg's day.
{14153}{14233}This is Beau Brandenburg's|first victory in three races.
{14238}{14276}He's gotta be happy.
{14281}{14386}Brandenburg's back in the lead in|the race for the world championship.
{14509}{14580}Crusher, it's time|to call Joe Tanto.
{15344}{15369}Hello?
{15416}{15479}You'll never be up before me,|old friend.
{15519}{15551}How you doing, Carl?
{15591}{15612}l was just...
{15637}{15672}...feeling nostalgic.
{15726}{15758}You still there?
{15763}{15854}-Can you push it to the ragged edge?|-Yeah, l think so.
{15859}{15913}-And the fear?|-lt's gone.
{15924}{15991}-Fear's never gone.|-Yeah, maybe.
{16057}{16117}-What about Memo?|-I'm making a change.
{16123}{16186}Memo's out, you're in.
{16191}{16241}You're driving for me again, Joseph.
{16246}{16295}Welcome back to the big show.
{16492}{16519}What is it, Jimmy?
{16534}{16603}Because this bad thing|is coming at a bad time.
{16618}{16677}-So talk to me.|-l said, it's nothing.
{16688}{16729}What am l, a piece of wood?
{16760}{16825}-l'm talking to you!|-Look, l can't do this.
{16830}{16911}l can't handle it.|l'm being pulled in 10 directions.
{16920}{16989}l thought l could handle it,|but l can't.
{16993}{17050}You can, and you will.
{17054}{17133}l don't care, we deal with it.|Okay?
{17138}{17195}Then stop pushing|like you're one of them.
{17201}{17257}Wait. ''Them''?
{17278}{17328}Like l'm the enemy? ''Them''?
{17388}{17427}That's great. That's....
{17475}{17557}Ever since you started kicking my ass|on everything with wheels...
{17562}{17643}...it's been us. My brother|has the touch, l don't. Fine.
{17649}{17705}But what l do have|is allegiance to you.
{17709}{17762}So don't doubt me. Don't do that.
{17811}{17903}l saw this 8-year-old,|goofy-looking kid...
{17907}{18018}...on a piece of junk go-cart,|come from three laps behind...
{18024}{18069}...to beat guys twice his age.
{18106}{18166}You rebounded then, right?
{18171}{18211}We'll rebound now.
{18223}{18298}Everybody trips. That's okay.|That's life.
{18302}{18355}lt's how fast you get up that counts.
{18377}{18416}So get up, Jimmy.
{18440}{18484}But get up fast.
{19043}{19141}We just got word from Carl Henry|that Joe ''The Hummer'' Tanto...
{19145}{19184}... will replace Memo Moreno...
{19237}{19266}...as Bly's teammate.
{20091}{20120}Excuse me.
{20148}{20204}How about an autograph, cold fish?
{20211}{20293}-What are you doing here, Joe?|-Glad to see you're still warm.
{20298}{20354}They figured you needed|some competition.
{20368}{20421}Now there's a familiar face.|Sophia!
{20431}{20467}Don't call her, please.
{20486}{20508}What's wrong?
{20541}{20586}-Joe--|-Still working here, huh?
{20591}{20670}-We haven't seen you in a long time.|-No, no, no.
{20675}{20720}You keeping him under control?
{20725}{20798}-You driving?|-Yeah, back with Carl Henry's team.
{20803}{20848}-Wow.|-Yeah.
{20852}{20883}That's great.
{20938}{20966}Well....
{21036}{21080}l'll see you around, Joe.
{21151}{21233}-She wants to kill you. What happened?|-Nothing.
{21237}{21262}Nothing?
{21267}{21327}Why'd they put you in a car again?
{21331}{21374}All you do is get in the way.
{21379}{21450}-Somebody thinks l got something left.|-Somebody?
{21454}{21485}-Yeah.|-What do you think?
{21490}{21529}l think it's will over skill.
{21538}{21603}Will over skill?|Like Detroit in '97?
{21625}{21685}-Accidents happen.|-Accidents?
{21705}{21738}You almost killed me.
{21743}{21830}You know, Beau, l'm just|glad l'm back. l really am.
{21885}{21943}-l'm different now.|-You...
{21949}{21991}...will never be different.
{21996}{22049}Be seeing you in my rear-view, Joe.
{22101}{22137}-Excuse me.|-Yeah.
{22145}{22204}Please, picture. Please.
{22209}{22243}Picture? No problem.
{22317}{22368}You gotta be kidding, right?
{22474}{22501}Smile.
{22570}{22598}How you doing, guys?
{22603}{22638}-Joseph.|-Carl.
{22662}{22710}l want you to meet our sponsors.
{22719}{22763}You've been gone a while, Joe.
{22768}{22834}Not really. Been up north|testing cars for us.
{22838}{22882}Shouldn't he wear our hat?
{22917}{22969}lt's a little damp, isn't it?
{22975}{23004}-Just kidding.|-l'm sorry.
{23009}{23071}-This is Lucretia Jones.|-Hi.
{23076}{23131}-How you doing?|-Call me ''Luc.''
{23136}{23182}Luc? l think l can remember that.
{23187}{23254}She's a journalist and will|be with us all season.
{23259}{23333}She's doing an exposé|on male dominance in sport.
{23337}{23413}-Will you have time to talk?|-Gotta ask the legend.
{23418}{23494}-Whatever he wants.|-For a beautiful lady, of course.
{23507}{23583}-No speeding tickets, Joseph?|-No, no speeding tickets.
{23587}{23624}-Bye.|-Bye.
{23629}{23683}-Nice to meet you.|-See you later, Luc.
{23688}{23739}Give him hell, Joe.
{23761}{23819}l thought Tanto was dead,|for chrissake.
{23877}{23910}Whoa!
{23939}{23979}Now that ex-wife of yours...
{23992}{24037}...that's a piece of work.
{24053}{24142}Divorces you and marries|a fellow driver.
{24149}{24207}l'm realizing how much|l didn't miss you.
{24211}{24253}-You missed me.|-Next subject.
{24258}{24346}l got a rookie driver. His name|is Jimmy Bly. He's won five races.
{24352}{24405}He's starting to find ways to stumble.
{24410}{24473}l'm not losing that lead.|lt won't happen.
{24478}{24563}-Memo drives great. What happened?|-Memo forgot his damn job.
{24567}{24680}His job is to support the team.|To support Jimmy Bly. So he's gone.
{24685}{24755}l could've hired 100 young turks|to take his place...
{24759}{24818}...but l wanted somebody|who's been to the top...
{24824}{24919}-...and stumbled down to the bottom.|-Thanks for reminding me.
{24925}{25009}l wanted somebody that|gets his attention.
{25013}{25054}-Maybe gains his trust.|-Why?
{25060}{25113}Because you're gonna help him...
{25125}{25204}-...my old friend.|-Carl.
{25235}{25318}Let's get something straight.|l thought you wanted me to race.
{25324}{25358}No.
{25366}{25402}-l'm gone.|-No, you're not.
{25406}{25475}l'm not finished yet. We go back.
{25513}{25558}We go way back.
{25564}{25662}l carried you for six years.|You owe me, Joe.
{25699}{25750}All you gotta do is help this kid.
{25755}{25812}Who knows? You might enjoy it.
{25817}{25869}You got one offer on the table.
{25894}{25933}Your choice.
{26143}{26200}-What did you give him?|-Gas money.
{26454}{26552}There are a hundred guys more|qualified to back Jimmy. Why him?
{26558}{26654}Because when he's on, he's|one of the best you'll ever see.
{26658}{26695}Just sit back and watch.
{26911}{26937}What's he doing?
{26973}{27049}He's just wound up.|Doing his coin bit will relax him.
{27094}{27170}-What's his coin bit?|-He'll hold a slide...
{27176}{27248}...going full out, then go over|to pick up three coins.
{27285}{27350}Not with the front tire,|any fool can do that.
{27355}{27433}He'll snatch them up with|the back one and not lose speed.
{27439}{27506}-There's no way.|-You don't want to bet me.
{27932}{27970}There's number one.
{28245}{28270}There's number two.
{28429}{28458}What's that sound?
{28519}{28583}-lt sounds like humming.|-Yep.
{28589}{28614}Why is he humming?
{28627}{28717}Some crazy thing he does|when he's pushing close to the edge.
{28727}{28802}-Anyone else ever do that?|-Not among the living.
{29163}{29208}-Want to back off, Joe?|-Let him go.
{29214}{29264}Let's see if he's still got it.
{29650}{29738}You passed the audition, and l'm not|mopping up the mess, Hummer.
{30005}{30045}Not bad, Hummer.
{30300}{30374}-Your humming's getting better.|-Let me drive again?
{30379}{30451}l said your humming,|not your driving.
{30492}{30533}Go talk to the kid.
{30695}{30737}How you doing? l'm Joe.
{30742}{30800}-Nice run out there.|-lt was okay.
{30835}{30900}Hey, listen, l liked Memo.
{30919}{30967}He's a good guy, good driver.
{30973}{31037}Just so you know.|We didn't have any problems.
{31131}{31169}Two out of three, huh?
{31226}{31354}Why don't you and me grab a cup|of coffee and talk some strategy?
{31375}{31464}The strategy's simple: He drives,|you block. You block, he wins.
{31469}{31525}We gotta hit it.|We got a publicity blitz.
{31530}{31561}Can't we push that back?
{31566}{31626}Come on, it's part of the contract.
{31639}{31677}Talk to you later.
{31682}{31760}Just channel through me, okay?|l channel well.
{31791}{31825}Appreciate that.
{31964}{32002}Car coming down.
{32273}{32357}Last week's big news was Jimmy Bly's|close brush with the wall.
{32362}{32453}Bly was trailing Beau Brandenburg|on turn four of the last lap...
{32458}{32527}... when he lost control|at over 200 miles an hour.
{32531}{32602}I don't know what's going on|with Bly's driving.
{32606}{32699}It went so well earlier in the season,|surprising everyone.
{32704}{32769}He can't seem to|get it together on the track.
{32775}{32865}All eyes will be on Bly|at tomorrow's Toronto Grand Prix....
{33929}{34018}So, Luc, what have you learned|since you've been here?
{34025}{34105}-l used to think you just put gas in--|-Fuel.
{34130}{34196}-Get it right.|-Fuel. l knew that.
{34221}{34271}Put the fuel in and push the pedal...
{34276}{34304}...and that was it.
{34317}{34378}That is embarrassing,|that's what that is.
{34383}{34442}Joe, with only 10 races|left in the season...
{34448}{34508}...why'd they get you?|What makes you special?
{34513}{34560}Oh, special l'm not.
{34602}{34658}Do you feel awkward being back?
{34721}{34834}-Something you're not telling me?|-Well, rumor has it you...
{34838}{34883}...were the circuit's wild man.
{34887}{34937}You married a woman named Cathy.
{34941}{35006}You cleaned up, stopped|living the old lifestyle...
{35010}{35058}...things didn't work out.
{35069}{35151}-lnteresting, if it weren't me.|-lt's just what l heard.
{35155}{35213}-l don't want to upset you.|-Game's over.
{35224}{35352}You actually have something to say.|These young drivers have barely lived.
{35362}{35417}Your life is so colorful|by comparison.
{35423}{35509}You know, Luc, l wouldn't remind|you what a fool you've been...
{35513}{35610}...and then insult you|by calling it colorful.
{35709}{35805}-l'm sorry.|-So don't judge me until you know me.
{35819}{35907}-How do l do that?|-By finishing this game, wiseass.
{35933}{36005}Wiseass? Right.
{36014}{36039}Good luck.
{36365}{36387}Hi.
{36415}{36438}Hi.
{36503}{36576}-So.|-So.
{36633}{36711}l heard about you and Beau.|And l'm sorry.
{36741}{36774}Thanks.
{36796}{36837}lt's my problem.
{36842}{36898}l'm sorry, Sophia.|l didn't mean to...
{36902}{36944}...get into your business.
{37012}{37042}l'm trying to talk.
{37116}{37184}l just came out of|a three-year relationship.
{37188}{37252}-That's a long time.|-Yeah, it's a long time.
{37283}{37351}When you get used to someone,|it's not....
{37420}{37451}l don't know.
{37505}{37541}What?
{37657}{37716}-l shouldn't be here.|-Wait. No.
{37721}{37810}-l shouldn't be doing this.|-Sophia, please.
{37834}{37857}Stay.
{38055}{38102}l'm not looking to get involved.
{38125}{38177}l'm not over him.
{38181}{38256}l understand that.|l'm just looking for a friend.
{38268}{38299}You sure?
{38333}{38392}-Yeah. l think so.|-Think?
{38487}{38552}Do you want to go sit down,|talk for a while?
{38585}{38651}Yeah. Yeah, l would.
{38746}{38845}Welcome to Toronto, Canada,|and this year's Toronto Molson Indy...
{38851}{38918}...and ESPN's live coverage|of this race.
{38924}{38979}-Hi, l'm Jeff Oaken.|-l'm Dave Wershafter.
{38984}{39078}...and this is race day|beside the lake.
{39119}{39145}Because it is time.
{39161}{39226}All the qualifying|and practicing is done...
{39230}{39324}...it's time to play the cards|and see how it goes down.
{39703}{39770}Ladies and gentlemen,|welcome today's drivers:
{39776}{39817}Max Papis, Joe Tanto...
{39840}{39894}...Jimmy Bly, Beau Brandenburg....
{39919}{39982}This race is being watched|by millions...
{39986}{40030}...from Finland to Australia.
{40055}{40137}Over 250,000 people expected|here in Toronto alone...
{40142}{40227}...from across the world.|110-lap race on a street track.
{40232}{40295}A lot of different styles,|but the street track...
{40301}{40371}...is considered as being|the most hazardous.
{40377}{40462}That's because it takes place|on ordinary city streets.
{40467}{40579}You guys here in Toronto|should be the loudest folks to cheer.
{40587}{40633}Well, well, well.
{40659}{40718}So, what about me?
{40741}{40786}How do l look?
{40790}{40865}Or do you still hate answering|loaded questions?
{40895}{40942}Go ahead, ask me.
{40953}{41020}-You love him?|-l love a lot of things.
{41027}{41085}-Why marry him?|-He's a younger, better you.
{41120}{41145}Ouch.
{41161}{41214}-You want to know more?|-No.
{41231}{41311}You left me.|With nothing, l might add.
{41316}{41444}Just as Memo and l are starting to|get something here, you steal his job.
{41450}{41507}And he still likes you.|How pathetic is that?
{41512}{41580}l don't understand this|''brotherhood of speed'' crap.
{41586}{41631}Just answer me one question.
{41641}{41739}Does hurting me make you feel better,|or does that come naturally?
{41889}{41986}You think you were better than me.|You weren't.
{42099}{42131}Hey.
{42227}{42268}-Joe.|-Memo.
{42274}{42331}Hey, did Cathy say anything bad?
{42336}{42423}She better not. Look at you.|How you been, good? Huh?
{42428}{42474}Listen, l'm sorry about all this.
{42478}{42540}Somebody had to do it,|why not an old friend?
{42545}{42582}That makes it even worse.
{42594}{42678}-You never called about our wedding.|-No, l didn't.
{42683}{42748}Hey, friends don't do that.
{42753}{42830}lf they have problems, they talk.|We always did that.
{42834}{42896}Sometimes good things happen|from bad ones.
{42913}{42962}But, if it'd make you happy...
{42966}{43029}-...l'll divorce her.|-Memo, what are you doing?
{43038}{43107}Right now, right here, today.|l'm divorced.
{43134}{43186}But only if you marry me.
{43190}{43284}-Get out. Come on.|-Please. You know, l get so lonely.
{43289}{43344}Yeah, you look like you're lonely.
{43368}{43468}l just want to enjoy my life.|My real life...
{43482}{43524}...not this one.
{43535}{43571}And Cathy does that for me.
{43588}{43688}Amigo, l have to go. Show these|maricas what a real driver can do.
{43693}{43731}-l'll do my best.|-Okay.
{43736}{43757}Bye.
{43937}{43966}Sophia!
{43991}{44021}Where are you going?
{44069}{44110}Good luck today, Beau.
{44115}{44187}Everyone excited to see how|Joe Tanto does today.
{44193}{44263}His first race since|he nearly lost his life.
{44268}{44357}-Stop bothering people, wiseass.|-Don't mess with me.
{44393}{44441}The season's rookie leader, Bly.
{44446}{44554}It'll be interesting to see if this|young man can handle the pressure.
{44562}{44608}-What's she doing here?|-lt's all right.
{44612}{44644}No, this is not all right.
{44650}{44725}Brandenburg's whatever|enters your life by accident?
{44730}{44805}-''Whatever''? Hi, l'm Sophia.|-That's your problem.
{44809}{44845}DeMille, come on.
{44861}{44936}Weren't you being pulled|in too many directions?
{44950}{45030}-Man.|-That'll make more legroom for us.
{45035}{45129}We're ready in Toronto. Time for|the big one to get underway.
{45134}{45186}Working your way down the track?
{45221}{45298}Brandenburg is on the pole|first again.
{45314}{45379}As you have heard,|we are ever so close.
{45709}{45782}-We have five minutes to race time.|-Joseph.
{45793}{45846}Gentlemen, to your cars.
{45993}{46054}Hey, Jimmy. Good luck, man.
{46082}{46105}Thanks, man.
{46124}{46179}All the racers down in pit lane now...
{46184}{46279}...are in the final stages|of getting ready for this race.
{46305}{46358}Pace cars are standing by.
{46421}{46511}We are almost underway|here in Toronto.
{46583}{46664}Ladies and gentlemen,|are you ready for racing?
{47020}{47071}Gentlemen, start your engines.
{47689}{47783}Starting today's race from|the pole position, Beau Brandenburg.
{47802}{47877}Second qualifier, Dario Franchitti.
{47881}{47931}Third, Christian Fittipaldi.
{47936}{48052}They're warming their tires to desired|temperature for better traction.
{48057}{48121}This is the first|of four warm-up laps.
{48141}{48214}All eyes on the green flag|ready for it to drop.
{48219}{48279}Sixteenth, Joe Tanto.
{48449}{48482}The race is underway!
{48486}{48565}They roar toward the first turn,|a right-hander, a treacherous gate.
{48580}{48637}They funnel down into that corner.
{48845}{48914}The second passing opportunity|lies just ahead.
{48919}{49003}Someone's in trouble!|Two cars sideways, the Visteon car!
{49008}{49101}Right through the barrier!|He's flipping up end over end!
{49106}{49179}The Visteon car in big trouble!
{49312}{49374}An incredible accident!
{49410}{49454}This puts us at|a full course yellow.
{49459}{49557}It'll give the drivers a chance|for their first pit stops of the day.
{49587}{49685}One of the strategies to this game|is when to bring your man in.
{49811}{49936}An extra second in the pits can cost|a driver a place or two in this race.
{50194}{50291}There goes Brandenburg.|Bly, and Tanto is out.
{50301}{50386}All three with very fast pit stops,|just over 12 seconds.
{50390}{50499}As Andretti and Tracy almost|get together on the exit!
{50513}{50604}But now Brandenburg's in front,|Jimmy Bly in second.
{50618}{50688}l want you to go after Brandenburg.|Go right now. Go!
{50693}{50792}We have some really interesting|driving by Bly behind Brandenburg.
{50798}{50900}-l can't find a hole.|-Don't look for a hole. Make a hole.
{50904}{50978}Back to full speed,|Bly in pursuit of Brandenburg.
{50980}{51054}He's right there.|He tries him at every corner.
{51225}{51291}Jimmy, you got 10 laps to go.|Conserve the tires.
{51296}{51363}You talk into that again,|l'll make you eat it.
{51367}{51433}Don't conserve anything. Go get him.
{51479}{51570}If he's gonna overtake Brandenburg,|it'll happen in Turn 3.
{51576}{51612}And it's right--
{51616}{51675}Oh, look at that!
{51728}{51765}What a way to move!
{51769}{51869}Jimmy Bly grabs the lead away|from Brandenburg. It's magical.
{51874}{51937}And Jimmy Bly has just taken the lead!
{51941}{51978}-Joe.|-Yeah?
{51982}{52008}l want you to pit now.
{52013}{52061}Why? l don't need to pit, Carl.
{52070}{52105}l want you to pit.
{52111}{52219}In a very unusual move, Carl Henry|has just called Tanto into the pits.
{52225}{52275}He hit the marks.
{52279}{52344}l know what you're doing, Carl.|lt's wrong.
{52350}{52404}They're changing the tires, refueling.
{52410}{52496}I see no movement on the chassis,|no wing adjustments.
{52501}{52583}l'm not asking you to like this, Joe.|Just work with me.
{52669}{52750}In the meantime, the veteran|Brandenburg behind Bly.
{52754}{52878}That's gotta worry the young rookie.|One mistake, that's all it'll take.
{52892}{52979}-Hold. Hold, Joseph, hold.|-Come on, come on, damn!
{53100}{53154}Come on, Carl, let me out of here!
{53204}{53265}Bly in front, Brandenburg second.
{53270}{53311}Carl, l can't hold him off.
{53394}{53469}Now, Joe. Go get that son of a bitch.
{53499}{53573}They release Tanto,|and he roars out of the pit!
{53578}{53653}I don't know what|Carl Henry and his team were thinking.
{53658}{53745}Tanto's making a very fast exit|from the pit. Look at this!
{53751}{53863}Tanto slices in between|Bly and Brandenburg!
{53879}{53941}The officials aren't gonna|like that one.
{53952}{54055}Tanto has to allow Brandenburg|to pass him after a move like that.
{54092}{54140}One lap to go now.
{54214}{54320}It's Bly and Brandenburg battling|it out in the last half-mile.
{54441}{54495}Brandenburg tries to the inside!
{54520}{54604}They come off the turn neck and neck.|Who's it gonna be?
{54625}{54711}And here they come!|The checkered flag is out!
{54780}{54849}It's Jimmy Bly,|the winner of this race!
{54883}{54980}As they go around the track,|the checkered flag is flown, and....
{54986}{55039}Very good strategy, Carl. Thank you.
{55044}{55117}What a battle between|Jimmy Bly, Beau Brandenburg.
{55123}{55208}This time, the young rookie|took it to the veteran.
{55302}{55354}You did all right today, Joseph.
{55429}{55475}Don't ask me to do that again.
{55763}{55869}Jimmy, after four lackluster|performances, is Jimmy Bly back?
{55877}{55905}Well, l hope so.
{56040}{56133}Everyone falls down.|lt's just how fast you get up, right?
{56165}{56246}Beau, the win could be|called controversial.
{56252}{56319}-Well, a win is a win.|-So you won't protest?
{56329}{56445}No, but l will have some lunch.|Anyone wants to join me?
{56516}{56545}Thank you.
{56569}{56627}Enjoy. This won't happen again.
{57150}{57187}Jimmy, want to talk later?
{57191}{57294}lf he wants to talk, he'll be|talking to me, okay? Come on.
{57407}{57519}Know how much you'll be worth if|you win? They'll buy you in sections.
{57524}{57598}Your eyes to a sunglass company,|your arm to a watch company.
{57603}{57699}Your foot to a shoe company. Or maybe|you'd like to keep some parts.
{57703}{57790}-Come on, he just finished racing.|-Hey, you're not here.
{57795}{57836}-DeMille.|-What?
{57849}{57886}What's so wrong with what she said?
{57921}{57950}Nothing.
{58025}{58051}Nothing.
{59475}{59508}What are you doing?
{59565}{59604}-Swimming.|-Swimming?
{59614}{59689}That's swimming to you, huh?|l don't think that's swimming.
{59694}{59735}That's a little beyond.
{59774}{59811}l've never seen anything like that.
{59828}{59911}Pretty fantastic.|Where'd you learn how to do that?
{60003}{60085}-l was raised by frogs.|-Raised by frogs?
{60257}{60337}-Well, l'm glad you escaped.|-Oh, thank you.
{60377}{60432}Jimmy, what's on your mind?
{60519}{60589}-How does Beau do it?|-Do what?
{60604}{60682}Stay on top. Stay focused.
{60729}{60766}He drives scared.
{60796}{60861}No, l don't think so.|That guy is ice.
{60866}{60946}To you, he's ice. lnside he's scared.
{60974}{61054}But he likes it.|He says it makes him try harder.
{61090}{61165}He says the day he's not afraid|is the day he'll stop.
{61191}{61271}You're just as good.|And the day you stop caring...
{61277}{61383}...what other people think and make|yourself happy, you'll be even better.
{61475}{61503}Come on.
{61844}{61902}Don't you ever stop running,|cold fish?
{61907}{61975}Block me again|and l'll put you into the wall.
{61979}{62035}Well, that's not gonna happen again.
{62060}{62088}Believe me.
{62121}{62184}-What are you trying to prove?|-Got nothing to prove.
{62189}{62315}No, you proved you could do very|little with very much. Forget it.
{62320}{62384}Why do l waste my time|talking to this guy?
{62388}{62455}Because no one else|likes your arrogant ass.
{62491}{62566}-So that's it.|-That's it. Mystery solved.
{62629}{62705}While you're in this good mood,|do yourself a favor.
{62710}{62766}-What?|-Take her back if she wants you.
{62773}{62845}Stay out of my business, Joe.|What are you doing?
{62850}{62914}l'm just talking.|You do want her back, right?
{62929}{62962}Why do you care?
{62965}{63054}You two have a lot of history.|That doesn't go away so fast.
{63059}{63138}-l pushed her away, Joe.|-But you weren't thinking right.
{63154}{63203}l wasn't thinking at all.
{63245}{63326}You know, it's really hard when--
{63341}{63379}When l see her with him.
{63404}{63450}And l did it, you know?
{63461}{63533}lt was me. l'm responsible for it.
{63566}{63625}You wanted to win no matter the cost.
{63629}{63714}-You want me to talk to her?|-No, Joe, don't do that.
{63721}{63785}You don't want either of us|to talk to her?
{63826}{63863}That's just great.
{64020}{64099}Hey, Beau, if this is about pride,|you better forget it.
{64104}{64210}-That's how the whole thing started.|-What would you do?
{64214}{64287}Me? To get someone back|that l really love?
{64291}{64339}Get that rock out of my stomach?|Crawl.
{64344}{64390}-You'd crawl?|-Crawl.
{64395}{64489}-You never crawl.|-l'd crawl till there's nothing left.
{64510}{64567}Come on, champ. Use your head.
{65406}{65442}Welcome to ESPN's coverage...
{65448}{65520}...of the Twin Rings Race|qualifying section.
{65525}{65598}And we're live|from the Japan Motor Speedway...
{65602}{65687}...in front of 120,000|spectators today.
{65692}{65781}Open wheel racing,|a very popular sport in Japan.
{65798}{65883}One day to the event,|and it's been a great day so far.
{65917}{65987}You should ask Jimmy how it is|to have the best manager.
{65991}{66088}With the final run just completed,|the top five best times were:
{66093}{66200}Brandenburg, Andretti, Gugelmin,|Montoya and Fittipaldi.
{66205}{66307}An interesting sideline: This year's|rookie point leader, Jimmy Bly...
{66312}{66382}...only managing a tie|for 10th place.
{66456}{66559}Relax, dude, don't shove.|Hey, don't shove. We're friends.
{66563}{66631}Jimmy! Jimmy, why 10th today?
{66699}{66754}How come this never happens to me?
{66786}{66809}All right!
{67758}{67828}-You seem preoccupied.|-l'm thinking about Jimmy.
{67833}{67928}You know, Carl thinks he can't cut it.|l think he can. lt's just--
{67933}{68000}lt's tough to get close|to this kid. lt is.
{68004}{68102}l think Carl cares more about|helping you than helping Jimmy.
{68107}{68193}-You're way off.|-l can see in the way he looks at you.
{68198}{68301}l mean, with Jimmy it's business.|With you, it's personal.
{70338}{70442}Keep it steady, Jimmy.|Keep your eyes out of the mirror.
{70604}{70730}With a steady drive, Beau Brandenburg|has managed to catch up to Jimmy Bly.
{70735}{70855}The veteran working both sides,|doing all he can to make Bly nervous.
{70860}{70920}Don't let him intimidate you.
{71013}{71061}l don't know if l can do this.
{71078}{71198}-You should talk less and drive more.|-Looking great, Jimmy.
{71217}{71313}Brandenburg knows every inch|of this racetrack.
{71317}{71393}He moves inside of Bly,|lets him know he's there.
{71427}{71463}Let's take him down.
{71503}{71578}Now it looks like he's gonna try|him on the outside.
{71702}{71743}They're neck and neck!
{71803}{71860}He gets by!|Brandenburg is in the lead.
{71865}{71941}That's some incredible driving|by Beau Brandenburg.
{71975}{72080}Bly's teammate, Tanto, got Bly to|the front of the pack earlier today.
{72089}{72153}Jimmy, don't let him get to you.|Shake it off.
{72240}{72312}-l'll get it back. l can get it back.|-Stay on him.
{72317}{72391}Now we'll see if Bly has learned|through this season.
{72396}{72466}Can he come back and regain the lead?
{72511}{72592}-Bly will try it on the high side.|-Don't overdrive the car.
{72610}{72695}-The suspension's getting loose.|-Bly is looking everywhere:
{72701}{72784}Inside, outside, high, low,|just nowhere to go.
{72788}{72835}Don't overdrive the car.
{72840}{72940}The rear is drifting.|Jimmy, keep it steady.
{73006}{73048}Don't overdrive the car.
{73205}{73251}Don't overdrive the car.
{73299}{73377}They're in the final lap.|This is it. Final turn.
{73381}{73492}Bly still all over the place.|He's coming up around, going high.
{73498}{73561}Bly's in trouble!|Bly's in serious trouble!
{73566}{73665}He's off to the gray stuff!|Oh, he slams into the wall!
{73831}{73874}Oh, my God!
{74401}{74452}Are you okay, Jimmy?
{74460}{74558}Safety trucks are rolling.|The crowd on its feet, silent.
{74744}{74839}We all await word on the fate|of rookie driver Jimmy Bly.
{75189}{75287}They pull him out from under the car.|He gives the crowd a wave.
{75292}{75389}Jimmy Bly, after that|awesome accident, is all right.
{75394}{75458}And the crowd responds to it.
{75506}{75529}What a waste.
{75877}{75962}It's my pleasure to welcome you|to glimpse into the future...
{76024}{76099}...and the 1000 horsepower|extreme machines...
{76104}{76159}...that'll race us|into the millennium.
{76163}{76263}Kindly join me in welcoming|the power and the glory.
{76502}{76616}Well, Joe. Now what part of formal|didn't you understand?
{76621}{76655}Wait a minute.
{76688}{76787}Oh, my mistake, yeah.|l'm gonna go get a drink.
{76792}{76837}-You look very nice.|-Thank you.
{76842}{76884}-Hey, rebel.|-Yeah.
{76889}{76917}What you got there?
{76921}{76985}lt's something l want|to give Jimmy later.
{76995}{77055}Be selective who you spend time with.
{77059}{77133}Extend yourself.|These people make everything happen.
{77138}{77202}-He's right.|-You'll stay around, right?
{77205}{77239}l'll be around.
{77271}{77324}You do know your way around,|don't you?
{77329}{77404}-l like your brother.|-l liked him first.
{77409}{77500}-DeMille?|-Nina. Exactly who l wanted to see.
{77508}{77582}-You look fantastic.|-Thank you.
{77589}{77711}Earlier today you said that Jimmy|has to find it off the track.
{77721}{77791}-What'd you mean?|-Here we go with the questions.
{77806}{77835}Gotta find that quiet spot.
{77840}{77929}lf your mind's not right,|you will get torn apart.
{77941}{78035}So you better buckle up.|lt's gonna be a bumpy ride.
{78073}{78148}l can't believe that line still works.
{78203}{78295}Now this is either very|unprofessional, or naive...
{78301}{78382}...or she swallowed your bullshit|and loved the taste.
{78387}{78479}-Where's Memo?|-Replacing you. Working his way down.
{78485}{78587}Joe, if you don't get it by midnight,|you're probably not gonna get it.
{78603}{78677}And even if you do,|l don't think it'll be worth it.
{78727}{78770}Just an observation.
{79024}{79054}Excuse me.
{79078}{79114}You make any new friends?
{79119}{79213}Like these people want to talk to me.|When the season's over....
{79217}{79281}-What?|-l was thinking...
{79285}{79371}...maybe we could go someplace.|l've never even had a vacation.
{79396}{79444}-Never?|-Never.
{79494}{79563}No pressure, all right?|Just think about it.
{79593}{79632}Two minutes, please?
{79744}{79787}What a coincidence.
{79865}{79940}ls this a little experiment|for you or something?
{79950}{80019}Dark chapter you can tell|your friends about?
{80052}{80113}Maybe you like being manhandled.
{80127}{80165}That l can understand.
{80170}{80251}But it's the being dumped part|that's kind of a drag.
{80296}{80369}So you were just used and abused?
{80386}{80434}Was that attitude?
{80465}{80520}Saucy. Good for you.
{80606}{80698}And next time l'm around, look at him.|He ain't over it.
{80745}{80789}Your mascara's running.
{80871}{80908}That's cute.
{80960}{81003}Stupid bitch.
{81011}{81107}-So, are you two enjoying the evening?|-l'll wait over there.
{81112}{81190}lf you win a championship,|what would you do first?
{81203}{81245}l don't know, really.
{81251}{81331}You've had some peaks|and valleys over the season.
{81336}{81382}What have you learned?
{81389}{81465}What have you learned|that you never realized before?
{81469}{81531}-That it's another world.|-Where air is rare.
{81536}{81615}Your team can take it all|with a strong show in Germany.
{81620}{81678}How do you prepare|for something like--?
{81683}{81811}There you have it, James Bly obviously|very pensive about the upcoming race.
{81817}{81860}-Yeah, well--|-What's happening?
{81874}{81929}-What's it look like?|-Jimmy.
{81934}{82007}-You came with me.|-Maybe she'll leave with you...
{82012}{82080}...but what l have to say|you don't need to hear.
{82084}{82162}Just let him talk.|lt doesn't mean anything.
{82166}{82262}-Yes, it does mean something.|-What, Beau? What does it mean?
{82305}{82366}We should probably just go.|Sophia, let's go.
{82371}{82424}-Don't do that.|-Don't do what?
{82429}{82513}-That's none of your business.|-Come on. What's going on?
{82518}{82579}-lt's nothing, DeMille.|-Back off.
{82651}{82714}Come with me for a second.|Can l talk to you?
{82719}{82791}-You're doing this all wrong.|-l know.
{82806}{82843}l do everything wrong.
{82849}{82918}-Excuse us.|-l can't believe this is happening.
{82958}{83027}l don't want to spend|more time away from you.
{83062}{83101}l miss you.
{83160}{83194}l miss you too.
{83238}{83308}-Really?|-Yeah.
{83318}{83445}Do not go over there. Trust me.|Jimmy, please. Calm down, calm down.
{83450}{83559}Don't blow this. Not over her.|This is not eighth-grade prom.
{83564}{83624}How you act,|these things are important.
{83634}{83686}-Jesus Christ!|-He's giving her a ring.
{83691}{83743}-That's not good.|-Please take it back.
{83749}{83856}Whatever it is, you can deal|with it later. This is not the time.
{83877}{83921}Just work with me on this.
{83927}{83957}Jimmy.
{84050}{84089}l'm so sorry.
{84114}{84178}Go. Just go.
{84227}{84256}l don't--
{84275}{84325}-Let me explain it to you.|-Hey, you need--
{84361}{84383}Get away from me.
{84387}{84435}-Play somewhere else.|-Just listen.
{84439}{84478}-Five minutes.|-Go away!
{84483}{84530}-Jimmy.|-Don't push me, don't push me.
{84534}{84566}-Go.|-Fine, fine, okay!
{84571}{84638}-Play your game somewhere else.|-Get the hell away from me.
{85037}{85079}Move, move, move! Move!
{87160}{87185}l need backup!
{87276}{87299}Pull over!
{87313}{87351}Come on, Jimmy, pull over!
{89762}{89804}Get away from me, man. Just--
{89809}{89839}You want to go through me? Come on.
{89851}{89881}l want to fight him.
{89885}{89909}-For what?|-For what?
{89914}{89938}You weren't there?
{89943}{90001}What do you think he did,|take your woman away?
{90005}{90045}Why did l let him take her away?
{90051}{90099}She was gone.|She was always gonna leave.
{90104}{90135}What do you know anyway?
{90140}{90191}Your brother puts so much|pressure on you...
{90196}{90254}...you looked for an edge.|You figured she was it.
{90259}{90299}Why do you act like you care?
{90304}{90352}l'm just a thing to you,|part of the job.
{90356}{90441}You pick up a check to help me out|since you didn't help yourself.
{90450}{90488}Why does that make you better?
{90493}{90533}lt doesn't.|Why did you take the car?
{90537}{90568}l don't need to be pushed.
{90574}{90614}-Go on, say it.|-Forget this.
{90619}{90713}You hoped this would get you thrown|out. You're looking for the exit.
{90718}{90755}What are you talking about?
{90760}{90814}You don't know who you are anymore!
{90821}{90896}You think you've got to be perfect|or you're a failure.
{90901}{90977}Well, forget that. Just forget it.
{91257}{91327}l was gonna give this to you|before all this went down.
{91338}{91371}lmpressive, isn't it?
{91462}{91532}-What is it?|-lt's the first thing l ever won.
{91537}{91612}lt was probably the last time|l ever felt pure victory.
{91617}{91679}No pressure, nobody breathing|down my back.
{91683}{91731}Just driving because l loved it.|Pure.
{91736}{91823}That's where you've gotta get back to.|Doing it naturally, for you.
{91827}{91906}l don't have your gift, but l do|have some things you don't have.
{91910}{91991}l got will and l got faith.|Don't laugh, l'm serious.
{92014}{92101}l believe that you can will yourself|into anything and do anything.
{92120}{92169}Having faith, that's like|believing in--
{92185}{92249}That's like having a good disease,|it's contagious.
{92254}{92329}Hang with people that have it,|you're gonna catch it.
{92334}{92383}That'll change your attitude.
{92393}{92444}And winning is an attitude.
{92461}{92511}So if you trust me--|No, if you trust yourself...
{92516}{92589}...by this season's end,|you'll be on top or you won't.
{92593}{92685}But l guarantee you're gonna know|what Jimmy Bly is made of.
{93018}{93069}Outside Chicago,|at the chicane it goes up...
{93075}{93141}...and comes down right where you|got Brandenburg--
{93146}{93182}ls that when l dip down?
{93219}{93251}Forget it.
{93262}{93334}l'm tired of these spoons.|We play with spoons.
{93339}{93392}-Say ''ah.''|-Ah.
{93396}{93438}Welcome to Germany.|Home of beer...
{93470}{93521}...the Autobahn and Beau Brandenburg.
{93565}{93627}-Qualifying begins tomorrow.|-With two races left...
{93632}{93716}...Beau is leading in the race|for the world championship.
{93731}{93766}Jimmy Bly is in second.
{93771}{93877}Commissioner Gilson has slapped|Bly and teammate, Joe Tanto...
{93882}{93935}... with a $25,000 fine...
{93940}{94018}...for their recent joyride|through downtown Chicago.
{94350}{94410}Doing great, Jimmy.|Keep pushing that speed.
{94515}{94540}Hey.
{94548}{94591}You don't need to talk to me anymore?
{94596}{94669}-lt's not like that.|-Really? What is it like?
{94709}{94771}All right, here you go. Jimmy.
{95833}{95856}Three, two.
{95864}{95906}One. Beautiful.|Come on, buddy.
{95961}{96037}Now, is he a hero, or is it hype?|What do you think?
{96050}{96084}What do you want me to say?
{96089}{96113}l want to hear what you think!
{96118}{96185}Jimmy just needs time|to develop, that's all.
{96190}{96266}When he can get it together off|the track, he will on it.
{96271}{96309}That's what l think.
{96328}{96355}Like you got it together?
{96374}{96442}You can help the kid off|the track more than on it.
{96457}{96527}You're not racing on Sunday.|l'm bringing Memo back.
{96580}{96631}Come here.|Joseph, over here.
{96665}{96690}Sit.
{96706}{96728}At my level.
{96779}{96825}lt's the moment of truth, my friend.
{96853}{96926}lf he doesn't deliver|next time out, he goes.
{96980}{97025}Don't hate me, but you go with him.
{97063}{97108}I'll come around here in Turn 7.
{97126}{97188}Driving off Brandenburg,|l'll fake outside.
{97194}{97233}Eight's a tough place to pass.
{97238}{97266}l'm gonna carry that speed...
{97272}{97350}...bring it down the straightaway.|l have plenty of speed.
{97356}{97381}Kind of flawless.
{97386}{97448}You're not even paying attention.|Watch this.
{97454}{97495}Show me again.
{97875}{97901}Yes, sir.
{97907}{98009}lf you find yourself in a position|to hold up traffic, do it.
{98021}{98061}l don't want any front-running.
{98080}{98117}You know the drill.
{98299}{98376}-Don't hurt yourself.|-l told you and l told you too.
{98437}{98480}-What?|-l told you l'll return.
{98485}{98525}Here l am, returned.
{98541}{98585}Like the real Zorro.
{98597}{98663}There's no helmet big enough|to hold that head.
{98669}{98706}There's so much love in here.
{98711}{98760}You keep smiling,|your face is gonna crack.
{98821}{98900}Why shouldn't he smile?|He's got a lot to be happy about.
{98906}{98951}He's back where he belongs.|Right, baby?
{98964}{98989}Yep.
{99022}{99050}Good?
{99057}{99093}Hey, you're so good.
{99100}{99146}You win this, yeah?
{99153}{99191}You're gonna win.
{99221}{99283}-Be safe, all right?|-You too, be safe.
{99844}{99909}This is the second to last race|of the season.
{99915}{99983}And what an exciting one|it promises to be.
{100097}{100131}Clouds are all around.
{100136}{100224}It looks like a thunderstorm|maybe a mile from the track.
{100229}{100274}The rain threat hasn't dampened...
{100279}{100351}...the spirits of this crowd|here in Germany.
{100492}{100515}What do you want?
{100567}{100594}Wanted to apologize.
{100616}{100664}Apologize to yourself.
{100684}{100717}Let's race.
{101011}{101075}l want you to stay in your world|and don't get into his.
{101079}{101139}You push him hard.|You get him thinking about you.
{101168}{101213}And you're not thinking about him.
{101219}{101242}Got it.
{101520}{101619}The skies are opening up|as the warm-up lap begins.
{101928}{101955}How's Jimmy?
{101960}{101984}He's all there.
{102352}{102407}We are racing in Germany.
{102413}{102494}Beau Brandenburg is starting|in the pole position today.
{102682}{102735}Jimmy Bly is in second.
{102747}{102842}Brandenburg moves out in front|on a course you can race in the rain.
{102849}{102933}Brake tires are on|and they are at speed.
{103001}{103086}Memo Moreno is back, giving|Jimmy Bly help as his teammate.
{103093}{103165}I'm sure Memo wants to make|his presence felt today.
{103197}{103230}Boy, he is on the fly.
{103234}{103285}It's like he has something to prove.
{103296}{103319}Good move, Memo.
{103350}{103386}Keep it steady.
{103407}{103466}Somebody wants their job back.
{103472}{103566}I think Joe Tanto may want|to watch his back.
{103683}{103715}Somebody's spinning!
{103721}{103754}Kenny Brack, he's in trouble.
{103758}{103821}He's gonna go way back|in the field on that one.
{103828}{103884}Back at the front|the battle continues.
{103958}{104021}Look at Brandenburg.|He cuts off Bly!
{104028}{104092}-He tried to take me out.|-Detach it. Hold your line.
{104100}{104144}Ride his blind spot.
{104191}{104253}I will, Joe,|but I can't see a damn thing.
{104258}{104327}Neither can he.|Just patience, my man. Patience.
{104852}{104877}Take him, Jimmy! Take him!
{104913}{104950}Jimmy Bly in second place.
{104955}{105008}Putting the pressure|on Beau Brandenburg.
{105116}{105139}Push it.
{105203}{105230}Here we go.
{105296}{105363}Bly is gonna try to make|a move in the corner...
{105369}{105427}...on Brandenburg on the outside.|He does it!
{105433}{105474}Bly takes the lead.
{105506}{105539}Goddamn brilliant.
{105570}{105631}Car in trouble, spinning|on the wet pavement.
{105635}{105705}-Looks like Gidley.|-Oh, here comes Max Papis!
{105725}{105757}Crash!
{105786}{105884}Head-on into that car!|Max Papis is airborne.
{106109}{106210}lf he takes it to the inside,|don't follow him, he's setting you up.
{106226}{106283}In the hairpin, that fight|for the lead continues.
{106290}{106327}Jimmy Bly has the lead now.
{106333}{106392}Brandenburg wants it back.
{106475}{106541}Brandenburg goes to the high side.
{106551}{106584}He gets by!
{106591}{106625}Brandenburg back to the lead.
{106665}{106705}Keep cool, he's putting on a show.
{106713}{106735}lt's a hell of a show.
{106766}{106795}Yeah, hell of a show.
{106810}{106899}Now Memo Moreno whips out|of the pack and passes Andretti.
{106904}{106989}He's really trying to get up there|with Brandenburg and Bly.
{106995}{107021}Memo, what are you doing?
{107028}{107058}l can almost touch him.
{107065}{107101}Hold your position.
{107107}{107131}Why? He's can win this.
{107152}{107228}I'm sure Carl Henry is not|too happy with Moreno.
{107238}{107295}Now Bly wants to make a move.
{107302}{107350}Hold on, Memo Moreno|trying to make...
{107356}{107427}...the same move on Jimmy Bly,|his teammate.
{107432}{107492}Memo, no passing. Do you hear me?
{107503}{107529}l'm right there, Carl.
{107568}{107613}Lift off. Steady.|What are you doing?
{107631}{107693}Moreno appears to have something|to prove here.
{107700}{107743}He gets alongside Bly again.
{107750}{107780}Damn it, we went over this!
{107792}{107815}Lift off!
{107857}{107907}Lift off! You work for me.|l said, lift off.
{107911}{107961}Why don't you let him drive?|Come on, baby.
{107968}{108018}-Come on. Come on. Come on!|-Shut up!
{108101}{108125}l've got to do this.
{108131}{108199}With his teammate in the battle|for the championship...
{108204}{108275}...Moreno decided to stick|his nose into this fight.
{108281}{108306}Hey, Memo, back off.
{108310}{108367}Only inches separate|these two cars.
{108374}{108396}Memo, you're too close.
{109594}{109648}What's going on here?|Bly is spinning.
{109663}{109748}He gets it under control.|He's going backwards on the track.
{109759}{109786}Jimmy, what are you doing?
{109825}{109866}Jimmy, what the hell are you doing?
{110343}{110370}Memo?
{110744}{110786}Get out! Oh, God!
{110821}{110860}We're getting chopper pictures.
{110867}{110966}This is horrible.|The car is upside down.
{110972}{111054}It's in a body of water.|Moreno is pinned underwater.
{111189}{111227}lt's okay, Memo. l'm here.
{111233}{111314}Beau, Memo crashed.|Jimmy went after him. You gotta help.
{111320}{111358}He went into the river at Turn 5.
{111364}{111432}l'll get you out, Memo.|lt's gonna be okay.
{111520}{111579}-l'm on my way.|-Beau, what are you gonna do?
{111584}{111618}Please be careful.
{111658}{111695}Oh, God! My foot!
{111733}{111766}Oh, come on.
{111784}{111846}Hang on, Memo! Hang on!
{111858}{111898}-Help me!|-Get out!
{111915}{111983}-Help me!|-Get out, now!
{111997}{112036}lt's gonna blow up!
{112085}{112113}Hurry!
{112261}{112346}We've got Bly and Brandenburg|to help a man in trouble.
{112358}{112431}Rescue teams are on the way,|but the remote location...
{112435}{112500}...of this crash makes|it difficult to reach them.
{112510}{112583}Lift it up, higher. Lift it!
{112693}{112763}Take a breath, Memo.|Come on. We're here.
{112781}{112811}We're gonna get you out.
{112858}{112893}Now!
{112903}{112935}Come on. One, two....
{113001}{113054}Get it over. Memo!
{113066}{113099}We got you, Memo.
{113138}{113186}-Come on, Memo.|-l can't move my leg!
{113204}{113227}Come on.
{113233}{113263}lt's gonna be okay.
{113269}{113292}Fuel everywhere.
{113299}{113381}They better get that driver|out of there and themselves too.
{113386}{113484}That fuel could ignite,|it could be floating on the water.
{113583}{113615}Come on!
{113660}{113688}Hurry up!
{114279}{114323}That is horrifying.
{114328}{114369}I've never seen anything like that.
{114376}{114428}It's unbelievable.
{114438}{114529}Worried about the well-being|of another driver, another competitor.
{114550}{114634}Goes to show the kind of men|they are, their true fabric.
{114641}{114708}But they worked as a team together.
{114788}{114852}Oh, my God, look at that!|Are they okay?
{114858}{114905}It looks like they are.|I think I see--
{114909}{114943}I see movement.
{115283}{115374}l can't move my legs.|l can't move them.
{115571}{115602}Jimmy?
{115607}{115640}Jimmy? You all right?
{115646}{115665}lt's just my foot.
{115670}{115731}You'll be fine.|You'll come through this fine.
{115735}{115786}-How's Memo?|-Fine, they're looking after him.
{116105}{116224}Our thoughts, of course, with Memo|Moreno and his family at this point.
{116468}{116503}Hey, Memo.
{116515}{116540}Hey, Joe.
{116590}{116614}How do l look?
{116646}{116669}Never looked better.
{116746}{116802}-Jimmy?|-Yeah?
{116819}{116842}Hey.
{116869}{116906}Thanks.
{116920}{116980}-Memo, l'm sorry.|-You came back for me.
{116991}{117033}Saved my life.
{117051}{117077}We race.
{117095}{117140}We take chances.
{117166}{117195}l took this chance.
{117219}{117254}So look at me.
{117296}{117329}Look at me.
{117333}{117368}Don't see you.
{117402}{117434}See me.
{117476}{117523}One who made a mistake.
{117580}{117608}That's all.
{117649}{117683}lt wasn't a mistake.
{118400}{118434}How are you doing?

{118508}{118557}All right if l come in?
{118579}{118607}Yeah.
{118706}{118739}You tried to get him out.
{118756}{118779}So did you.
{118784}{118809}You were there first.
{118834}{118909}l mean, he almost got you killed|and you still tried.
{118926}{118949}Anybody would've.
{118970}{118999}Would they?
{119061}{119099}You're a good man, Jimmy.
{119104}{119201}l'm sorry, l didn't want to win|the championship this way.
{119227}{119250}See you.
{120108}{120210}The old Joe Tanto had a couple|of attributes you should hold on to.
{120238}{120281}Wasn't long ago you would've said:
{120286}{120363}''There but for the grace|of God, it's not me.''
{120390}{120470}Quietly taking your place in the pack.
{120488}{120513}Where is that guy?
{120538}{120570}Where has he gone?
{120594}{120619}Who cares?
{120633}{120660}l do.
{120667}{120693}l miss him.
{120836}{120910}You're the first to know|l'm terminating the kid's contract.
{120935}{121002}-Why?|-l don't think he's the real deal.
{121028}{121090}l don't think he's mentally|tough enough.
{121127}{121168}l don't think he's adult enough!
{121175}{121215}Gets out of a car in a race.
{121221}{121282}-Saved a man's life.|-l'm not here to debate!
{121319}{121398}l'm gonna go for Brandenburg.|Next year.
{121414}{121475}-What are you doing?|-Whatever it takes to win.
{121500}{121555}-His brother know?|-He's brokering the deal.
{121559}{121591}-Don't do this.|-lt's done!
{121597}{121635}-Then undo it.|-You suddenly care.
{121642}{121698}-Don't kill him off!|-Don't kill him off?
{121708}{121751}l watched you kill yourself!
{121774}{121860}You had everything,|and you threw it all away!
{121867}{121936}And l had to sit there and watch!
{121958}{122031}The slowest man in the fastest sport.
{122035}{122152}l wake up every morning,|my legs are on fire.
{122163}{122258}l know l'm gonna have to sit|in this chair for the rest of the day.
{122278}{122370}But if they gave me one more chance,|l'd do it all over again.
{122434}{122461}lt ain't gonna happen.
{122500}{122610}We are all damaged.
{122708}{122755}l've got an excuse.
{122778}{122808}You don't.
{122842}{122875}Do you?
{123646}{123741}l want you to know that l know|about you going out to Brandenburg.
{123884}{123918}Where have you been?
{123924}{123958}Meeting after meeting.
{123965}{124006}l've got a dinner right now.

{124058}{124109}-Yeah, l'll see you tomorrow.|-Okay.

{124399}{124426}Something l have to tell you.
{124580}{124633}What restaurant did you pick?
{124638}{124728}Nina, you're in great hands.|You are going to love this place.
{124733}{124769}-DeMille.|-Jimmy.
{124779}{124841}What are you doing here?|l'll just be a minute.
{124901}{124945}Please don't walk away from me.
{124968}{124994}Did you sell me out?
{125001}{125050}Are you working for Brandenburg now?
{125069}{125106}We should take this inside.
{125110}{125141}Why are you doing this to me?
{125147}{125186}Wait a minute! Who sold out first?
{125193}{125251}l would never sell out my own brother.
{125257}{125329}When you stopped listening|to me that's what you did.
{125333}{125373}l just tried something different.
{125379}{125421}For the first time|l thought for myself.
{125428}{125490}-Was that wrong?|-Shutting me out is different.
{125496}{125584}And l was with you all the way|until you handed your mind over...
{125590}{125654}...to that has-been.|Who got you here?
{125658}{125753}Who got all the glory? You couldn't|book a plane ticket without me.
{125758}{125825}You left me, and let me|tell you something:
{125829}{125869}There's no worse feeling|getting someone...
{125876}{125933}...to the top only|to have them drop you.
{125939}{125974}You did that, you.
{125988}{126034}Ten years, Jimmy!
{126040}{126077}All a waste.
{126099}{126158}lt was coming together.|Why not wait a bit longer?
{126164}{126213}Because l'm not your goddamn waiter.
{126218}{126251}l was your manager.
{126257}{126334}And l deserve better than that.|l deserve much better!
{126341}{126436}Now you're over, and l am not going|down in flames with you, brother.
{126458}{126510}That's one trip you're taking alone.
{127315}{127389}Welcome to the Grand Prix.|It's a sunny day.
{127424}{127506}It's going to be a great race.|After an eventful season...
{127509}{127586}...this comes down|to championship time.
{127753}{127800}Everything's set.|Let's get this thing signed.
{127806}{127870}After the race it'll be a madhouse.|What do you say?
{127876}{127908}Let's hear what she says.
{127915}{127949}What's her idea?
{127955}{128017}Her idea? What do you mean her idea?
{128024}{128058}How does it feel?
{128064}{128118}What? How does what feel?
{128151}{128183}To be used.
{128191}{128241}What, l didn't treat you with manners?
{128246}{128294}You're gonna blow this over that?
{128309}{128393}What, do you want to hit me?|Would that make you feel better?
{128424}{128479}-Hurt?|-A little.
{128506}{128539}Didn't hurt.
{128584}{128611}Call that a punch?
{129610}{129634}Did you know?
{129644}{129696}-Know what?|-Know about my brother?
{129702}{129733}Yeah, l knew.
{129738}{129775}You could've told me.
{129783}{129827}l hoped you could work things out.
{129836}{129865}He was right, you know.
{129890}{129921}Never booked a plane ticket.
{129933}{130040}Remember l said by the season's end|you're gonna know what you're made of?
{130054}{130091}lt's the end of the season.
{130116}{130151}lt's up to you.
{130277}{130314}Carl, you have to let me race.
{130320}{130344}l can win.
{130351}{130441}Any driver that can't get out of|the car in five seconds can't run.
{130461}{130502}Trying to prove you're|better than l think?
{130531}{130558}Yeah.
{130638}{130660}Time him.
{131090}{131125}Ready?
{131161}{131188}Go!
{131322}{131370}-Four seconds.|-Great.
{131402}{131425}Not bad.
{131468}{131514}Now the vertical test.
{131536}{131581}Carl, don't push it.
{131587}{131630}The vertical test.
{131635}{131730}You jump up and down|on the bad foot 10 times...
{131734}{131782}...to see if you can handle|the pressure.
{131804}{131862}Again, my rules.
{131897}{131921}Don't glare, Joe.
{131945}{131980}Makes your eyes look small.
{131990}{132035}lt's all about commitment, right?
{132051}{132076}-Right.|-Right.
{132091}{132142}All right, Jimmy. One.
{132180}{132215}Two.
{132317}{132344}Three.
{132475}{132499}Four.
{132537}{132563}Five. Come on.
{132568}{132618}Six. Come on, Jimmy.|Seven. Come on.
{132625}{132682}Eight. Nine. Ten.
{132688}{132719}-Yeah!|-Good.
{132840}{132901}Too bad you didn't try|that hard sooner.
{133114}{133154}There are 100 laps...
{133159}{133258}...200 miles between this race|and a champion.
{133803}{133833}Bye-bye, Daddy.
{133903}{133937}Bye, Lucas.
{134666}{134739}Going into this race,|Brandenburg was thinking...
{134745}{134796}...he was the winner|of the championship.
{134803}{134883}He was four points ahead,|and Bly looked out of the running.
{134888}{134962}We've just received word|that Bly will be driving...
{134966}{135069}... which is amazing news after|his injury he suffered in Germany.
{135078}{135186}So as it stands,|if Jimmy Bly wins this race...
{135191}{135239}...he will become|the new world champion.
{135303}{135327}So why'd you do it?
{135369}{135450}You helped me.|l thought maybe l could help you.
{135551}{135599}-Well, l appreciate it.|-lt's okay.
{135604}{135639}Don't go too fast.
{135727}{135767}Take care. Appreciate you coming.
{135774}{135821}Take care of yourself.
{135828}{135943}Jimmy Bly is a hero today, along with|Joe Tanto and Beau Brandenburg...
{135950}{136024}... who all got to the scene|of Memo Moreno's crash...
{136030}{136108}... which had his car in the water.|He was about to drown.
{136114}{136169}They jumped in,|got him out of the water...
{136175}{136259}...before a big explosion|consumed the entire area.
{136302}{136403}You know that if l lose this race,|l'm going to blame it on you.
{136418}{136461}That's what l'm here for.
{136469}{136500}l love you.
{136511}{136537}l love you too.
{138545}{138626}Gentlemen! Start your engines!
{138708}{138749}Let's look at the starting grid.
{138755}{138805}Beau Brandenburg|in the pole position.
{138811}{138853}Gidley will be following him.
{138881}{138931}Joe Tanto in the Nextel car|starts 10th.
{138982}{139033}Bly is starting|in the 26th pole position.
{139039}{139067}He didn't qualify today.
{139074}{139144}He's got 100 laps to catch|Beau Brandenburg...
{139151}{139205}...if he wants to become|world champion.
{139832}{139902}We're off to a good start|here in Detroit.
{139950}{140002}Brandenburg's jumped out in front.
{140007}{140051}Trouble!
{140295}{140370}Tanto's caught in traffic.|He doesn't have anyplace to go!
{140451}{140517}Ladies and gentlemen,|we are under a yellow flag...
{140524}{140562}...until the cars can be removed.
{140567}{140641}Joe Tanto is in the pit|with a broken front wing.
{140646}{140686}What's the story on Tanto?
{140692}{140741}Tanto is out of it.|Don't worry about him.
{140756}{140789}Got it. That's too bad.
{140802}{140829}Come on. Come on!
{140835}{140925}Ladies and gentlemen,|we have just one lap until green.
{140999}{141027}Go, go, go!
{141156}{141248}A fast pit stop for the Nextel team,|but this unfortunate mishap...
{141253}{141306}...is going to drop Tanto|to last place...
{141312}{141381}...right behind his teammate,|Jimmy Bly.
{141425}{141460}So, Jimmy, what do you think?
{141482}{141515}lt's not looking too good.
{141535}{141558}We can work through this.
{141572}{141595}You think so?
{141604}{141659}l know we can|if we stay tight and close.
{141670}{141703}Okay. Let's do it.
{141712}{141764}Green flag comes out again.
{141903}{141943}l'll take it right, you cut left.
{141956}{142028}Look at this amazing teamwork|between Bly and Tanto!
{142050}{142109}Hey, Joe, not bad for an old-timer.
{142115}{142162}That's it. Every man for himself.
{142259}{142283}Hey, not so fast.
{142338}{142387}Who wants to be in front|of the other?
{142392}{142427}What the hell are you two doing?
{142443}{142477}Back off, back off.
{142483}{142519}Don't be afraid of me.
{142526}{142571}Why would l be afraid of you?
{142578}{142630}Carl, let Joe race his race.
{142636}{142669}Thanks, kid. l appreciate that.
{142726}{142794}Let's split them at the turn.|l'll take the inside.
{142803}{142843}They split around another car!
{142850}{142910}As they battle,|it brings both cars forward.
{143004}{143039}Pass me on the left, Jimmy.
{143117}{143145}Way to go.
{143157}{143234}Tanto and Bly are double-teaming|the entire field.
{143238}{143285}What an incredible display of driving!
{143387}{143473}-Come on, don't stop now.|-Stopping? Who's stopping?
{143525}{143585}We are now halfway|to the checkered flag.
{143594}{143638}Okay, Joe. Try to keep up.
{143789}{143820}Still back there, Joe?
{143827}{143868}-l'm still here.|-l'm impressed.
{143995}{144064}Bly passes and Tanto|is following suit.
{144135}{144235}With just 20 laps to go, Jimmy Bly|has just moved into seventh place...
{144241}{144300}...and teammate|Joe Tanto is in sixth.
{144306}{144330}Everybody's off the pace.
{144336}{144385}But Bly and Tanto|are coming on strong.
{144390}{144416}Brandenburg still leads.
{144422}{144503}In second place is Alex Barron.|Barron has an engine go!
{144526}{144583}Two cars swerving to miss the oil!
{144589}{144685}Car up over the wall!|Several cars involved!
{144761}{144849}Here comes Jimmy Bly.|He closes on the accident.
{145002}{145048}Bly has nowhere to go.
{145236}{145325}Bly and Tanto find|themselves in second and third...
{145331}{145363}...behind Beau Brandenburg.
{145381}{145468}The drivers will take advantage|of this full-course caution...
{145475}{145564}...and enter the pits|for the last time this season.
{145622}{145732}Brandenburg, Bly and Tanto all are|completing very fast pit stops.
{145770}{145878}Now, with 10 laps to go,|Beau Brandenburg is in first place...
{145884}{145981}...Jimmy Bly is in second,|and Joe Tanto is in third place.
{146032}{146137}The world championship comes down|to these last 10 laps.
{146225}{146280}Jimmy, show them|what you're made of, kid.
{146290}{146319}Okay, Joe.
{146334}{146360}Green flag!
{146386}{146414}We're back to racing!
{146420}{146477}It's a sprint to the finish|and championship.
{146594}{146680}Bly is right on Brandenburg's tail.|He wants that championship.
{146686}{146737}Take him now. Make your move.
{146772}{146855}He comes alongside Brandenburg.|Brandenburg cuts him off!
{146938}{146969}Bly is gonna try it again.
{146976}{147032}He cuts and ducks inside!|Bly has the lead!
{147038}{147125}Jimmy Bly has just taken the lead.
{147161}{147225}Bly gets past Brandenburg.|He's in the lead.
{147230}{147285}Great driving by Bly.
{147336}{147393}Brandenburg won't let Bly|get away that easily.
{147400}{147444}l'll pull him back in. There's time.
{147477}{147534}Brandenburg is putting|pressure on Bly.
{147540}{147566}Don't overreach, kid.
{147572}{147643}Just four laps to go and you are|the world champion.
{147677}{147712}He's losing it.
{147741}{147762}Come on, Jimmy!
{147767}{147857}Bly may be in trouble.|He weaves back and forth.
{147862}{147936}Brandenburg is right there,|ready to get past him.
{148107}{148168}And Brandenburg goes to the lead!
{148353}{148381}Nice while it lasted.
{148418}{148482}Bly loses the lead|with three laps to go.
{148486}{148513}He tried.
{148518}{148625}This is something we've seen|this young rookie do so many times.
{148630}{148699}Carl Henry has got|to be disappointed.
{148831}{148893}-What is he doing?|-Jesus.
{148910}{148934}He's back.
{149025}{149117}Now, Joe Tanto making a move.|He comes up alongside Jimmy Bly.
{149124}{149189}He passes him! Tanto to second.
{149207}{149254}They're shoving and elbowing|each other.
{149264}{149334}Brandenburg, Tanto, Bly.|One, two, three.
{149488}{149534}We've got one lap to go.
{149540}{149567}Let's do it.
{149859}{149941}Joe Tanto has taken the lead!
{149947}{149979}Unbelievable.
{150012}{150051}lt's incredible. l can't believe it.
{150057}{150113}But problems with Tanto's car!
{150118}{150158}Tanto's in trouble.
{150200}{150223}Will it hold together?
{150243}{150269}No, not for long.
{150276}{150309}-Hang on, Joe.|-Stay in there.
{150315}{150395}What's he doing? He ought|to park it but he stays in front!
{150407}{150464}l can't hold it together!|Take it, Jimmy!
{150535}{150576}They split him!
{150586}{150611}He's lifting off!
{150616}{150662}l see that. He had it!
{150668}{150781}Tanto has removed himself from|the race, leaving Brandenburg and Bly.
{150791}{150890}Neck and neck down the homestretch,|battling for the world championship.
{151315}{151409}Jimmy, just drive because you|love it. Drive for pure victory.
{151568}{151605}He's humming.
