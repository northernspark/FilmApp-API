1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:30,969
 

2
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:34,644
Mrs. Teasdale? - Yes, Your Excellency?
- I again ask you to reconsider.

3
00:01:34,644 --> 00:01:35,049
 

4
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:39,122
Gentlemen, I've already loaned
Freedonia over half my fortune.

5
00:01:39,122 --> 00:01:39,529
 

6
00:01:39,529 --> 00:01:44,557
I consider that money lost, and now
you're asking for another $20 million.

7
00:01:44,557 --> 00:01:45,769
 

8
00:01:45,769 --> 00:01:47,839
Only to meet this present emergency.

9
00:01:47,839 --> 00:01:48,249
 

10
00:01:48,249 --> 00:01:51,366
With $20 million, we can announce
a reduction in taxes.

11
00:01:51,366 --> 00:01:51,769
 

12
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:55,444
That's all the people ask.
- I'm inclined to agree with them.

13
00:01:55,444 --> 00:01:55,849
 

14
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,805
The government has been mismanaged.
- What?

15
00:01:57,805 --> 00:01:58,209
 

16
00:01:58,209 --> 00:02:03,078
I will lend the money, but only
if His Excellency withdraws.

17
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:03,489
 

18
00:02:03,489 --> 00:02:07,004
You ask me to give up my office?
- Yes. In a crisis like this,

19
00:02:07,004 --> 00:02:07,409
 

20
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:10,845
Freedonia needs a new leader,
a progressive fighter,

21
00:02:10,845 --> 00:02:11,249
 

22
00:02:11,249 --> 00:02:13,160
a man like Rufus T. Firefly!

23
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,569
 

24
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:15,366
Rufus T. Firefly!

25
00:02:15,366 --> 00:02:15,769
 

26
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:20,001
I'll lend the money to Freedonia,
only if Firefly is appointed leader!

27
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:42,729
 

28
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:46,085
The Honorable Secretary
of Finance and Parking!

29
00:02:46,085 --> 00:02:55,009
 

30
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:58,888
His Excellency,
Ambassador Trentino of Sylvania!

31
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:06,209
 

32
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:08,279
Ambassador.
- Mrs. Teasdale.

33
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:09,569
 

34
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:12,959
I'm anxious for you to meet
our new leader.

35
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:13,369
 

36
00:03:13,369 --> 00:03:18,443
No matter who rules Freedonia, to me
you will always be the First Lady.

37
00:03:18,443 --> 00:03:18,849
 

38
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:22,444
Permit me... Vera Marcal,
Ambassador Trentino.

39
00:03:22,444 --> 00:03:22,849
 

40
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:26,888
I've seen Miss Marcal dance
many times at the theater. - Thanks.

41
00:03:26,888 --> 00:03:28,489
 

42
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:32,846
The Honorable Pandooh of Mufhtan!
- I must greet His Honor.

43
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:38,969
 

44
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,358
What have you found out?
- Nothing.

45
00:03:41,358 --> 00:03:41,769
 

46
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:44,078
I've given up on the revolution.
I have a better plan.

47
00:03:44,078 --> 00:03:44,849
 

48
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:49,001
I can control Freedonia easier
by marrying Mrs. Teasdale.

49
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:49,409
 

50
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:52,560
Maybe that's not so easy.
From what I hear,

51
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:52,969
 

52
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:56,006
Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet
on this Rufus T. Firefly.

53
00:03:56,006 --> 00:03:56,409
 

54
00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:59,321
That's where you come in.
I place him in your hands.

55
00:03:59,321 --> 00:03:59,729
 

56
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:02,687
I don't have to tell you
what to do... Careful!

57
00:04:02,687 --> 00:04:04,729
 

58
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:07,687
I want you to meet
His Excellency's secretary Bob Roland.

59
00:04:07,687 --> 00:04:08,089
 

60
00:04:08,089 --> 00:04:09,920
Ambassador Trentino...

61
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,329
 

62
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:12,240
Miss Marcal.
- We've met.

63
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,649
 

64
00:04:12,649 --> 00:04:15,209
I hope
His Excellency gets here soon.

65
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:15,609
 

66
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:17,918
He makes it a point to be on time.

67
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:18,329
 

68
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,524
He's never been late
for an appointment.

69
00:04:20,524 --> 00:04:20,929
 

70
00:04:20,929 --> 00:04:24,239
His Excellency is due
to take his station,

71
00:04:24,239 --> 00:04:24,649
 

72
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:27,641
beginning his new administration.

73
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:28,049
 

74
00:04:28,049 --> 00:04:33,919
He'll make his appearance when
the clock on the wall strikes ten.

75
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,329
 

76
00:04:34,329 --> 00:04:37,480
When the clock on the wall
strikes ten,

77
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:37,889
 

78
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:41,518
all you loyal ladies
and you patriotic men,

79
00:04:41,518 --> 00:04:41,929
 

80
00:04:41,929 --> 00:04:48,368
let's sing the national anthem when
the clock on the wall strikes ten.

81
00:04:48,368 --> 00:04:56,169
 

82
00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:59,445
His Excellency is due
to take his station,

83
00:04:59,445 --> 00:04:59,849
 

84
00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:02,647
beginning his new administration.

85
00:05:02,647 --> 00:05:03,049
 

86
00:05:03,049 --> 00:05:08,248
He'll make his appearance when
the clock on the wall strikes ten.

87
00:05:08,248 --> 00:05:15,889
 

88
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:19,484
We'll give him a rousing cheer
to show him we're glad he's here.

89
00:05:19,484 --> 00:05:20,129
 

90
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:24,759
Hail, hail Freedonia...

91
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:29,529
 

92
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:33,920
Hail, hail Freedonia.

93
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,329
 

94
00:05:34,329 --> 00:05:41,041
Land of the brave and free.

95
00:05:41,041 --> 00:06:24,529
 

96
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:27,089
You expecting somebody?
- Yes.

97
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:36,249
 

98
00:06:36,249 --> 00:06:38,524
Your Excellency...

99
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:38,929
 

100
00:06:38,929 --> 00:06:42,285
We've been expecting you.
As chairwoman of the committee

101
00:06:42,285 --> 00:06:42,689
 

102
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:45,442
I extend the good wishes
of the people of Freedonia.

103
00:06:45,442 --> 00:06:45,849
 

104
00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:48,921
Never mind. Take a card.
- What do I do with a card?

105
00:06:48,921 --> 00:06:49,329
 

106
00:06:49,329 --> 00:06:51,684
Keep it. I've got 51 left.
Now what were you saying?

107
00:06:51,684 --> 00:06:52,089
 

108
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:55,843
As chairwoman,
I welcome you with open arms.

109
00:06:55,843 --> 00:06:56,249
 

110
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,205
How late do you stay open?

111
00:06:58,205 --> 00:06:58,609
 

112
00:06:58,609 --> 00:07:03,399
I've sponsored you, because you're
Freedonia's most able statesman.

113
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:03,809
 

114
00:07:03,809 --> 00:07:06,607
That covers a lot of ground.
You cover a lot of ground, too.

115
00:07:06,607 --> 00:07:07,009
 

116
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:10,126
You better beat it or they'll tear
you down and put up offices.

117
00:07:10,126 --> 00:07:10,529
 

118
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:14,761
You can leave in a taxi.
If not, you can leave in a huff.

119
00:07:14,761 --> 00:07:15,169
 

120
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:18,878
You don't stop talking. You must be
vaccinated with a phonograph needle.

121
00:07:18,878 --> 00:07:19,289
 

122
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:22,042
The future of Freedonia
rests on you.

123
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:22,449
 

124
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:26,124
Promise me you'll follow
in the footsteps of my husband.

125
00:07:26,124 --> 00:07:26,529
 

126
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:30,124
I haven't been on the job 5 minutes,
and she's making advances to me.

127
00:07:30,124 --> 00:07:30,649
 

128
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:33,561
But where is your husband?
- Why, he's dead.

129
00:07:33,561 --> 00:07:33,969
 

130
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:37,848
I bet he's using that as an excuse.
- I was with him till the very end.

131
00:07:37,848 --> 00:07:38,249
 

132
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:42,800
No wonder he died. - I held him
in my arms and kissed him.

133
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,209
 

134
00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:46,007
It was murder! - Will you marry me?
Oid he leave you money?

135
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:46,409
 

136
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:49,242
Answer the second question first.
- He left me his fortune.

137
00:07:49,242 --> 00:07:49,649
 

138
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:52,607
Is that so?
I'm trying to tell you I love you.

139
00:07:52,607 --> 00:07:53,009
 

140
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:56,968
Oh, Your Excellency...
- You're not so bad yourself.

141
00:07:56,968 --> 00:07:57,649
 

142
00:07:57,649 --> 00:08:01,608
I want to present you Ambassador
Trentino of Sylvania.

143
00:08:01,608 --> 00:08:02,009
 

144
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:03,920
His presence is a great pleasure.

145
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,329
 

146
00:08:04,329 --> 00:08:07,924
I can't stay very long.
- Even a greater pleasure.

147
00:08:07,924 --> 00:08:08,329
 

148
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:12,322
How about lending us $20 million,
skinflint? - That's a lot of money.

149
00:08:12,322 --> 00:08:12,729
 

150
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:17,120
I'll take that up with the Finance
Minister. - Then could I have $12?

151
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,529
 

152
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:21,078
$12? - On my 90-day note.
If it isn't paid back,

153
00:08:21,078 --> 00:08:21,489
 

154
00:08:21,489 --> 00:08:23,047
you can keep the note.

155
00:08:23,047 --> 00:08:23,449
 

156
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:26,009
Your Excellency, haven't we
seen each other before?

157
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:26,409
 

158
00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:29,481
I'm not sure I'm seeing you now.
It must be something I ate.

159
00:08:29,481 --> 00:08:29,889
 

160
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:34,599
Are you trying... - Oon't look now.
There's one man too many here,

161
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:35,009
 

162
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:36,362
and I think it's you.

163
00:08:36,362 --> 00:08:36,769
 

164
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:38,248
I'm so sorry.

165
00:08:38,248 --> 00:08:39,809
 

166
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:42,607
I want you to meet a charming lady.
- It's about time.

167
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:43,009
 

168
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:44,806
Just a moment...

169
00:08:44,806 --> 00:08:45,409
 

170
00:08:45,409 --> 00:08:46,762
I want to present Vera Marcal...

171
00:08:46,762 --> 00:08:47,169
 

172
00:08:47,169 --> 00:08:50,479
Go ahead. I can take it.
- You don't understand.

173
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:50,889
 

174
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:53,961
Vera Marcal, the famous dancer.
- Really?

175
00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:54,369
 

176
00:08:54,369 --> 00:08:55,961
Can you do this one?

177
00:08:55,961 --> 00:08:59,009
 

178
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:01,842
I danced before Napoleon.
No, he danced before me.

179
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:02,249
 

180
00:09:02,249 --> 00:09:05,082
200 years before me. Here's one
I picked up in a dancehall.

181
00:09:05,082 --> 00:09:08,369
 

182
00:09:08,369 --> 00:09:10,758
Here's another one
I picked up in a dancehall.

183
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:11,769
 

184
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:15,284
Perhaps we get a chance
to dance together?

185
00:09:15,284 --> 00:09:15,689
 

186
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:17,725
I could dance with you
till the cows come home.

187
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:18,129
 

188
00:09:18,129 --> 00:09:20,802
On second thought,
I'd rather you came home.

189
00:09:20,802 --> 00:09:21,529
 

190
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:24,362
Where's my secretary?
- Here I am! - Good heavens!

191
00:09:24,362 --> 00:09:24,769
 

192
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:27,966
Take a letter.
- Who to? - To my dentist.

193
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:28,449
 

194
00:09:28,449 --> 00:09:33,318
"Oear Oentist, Enclosed find check
for $500." Send it off now.

195
00:09:33,318 --> 00:09:33,729
 

196
00:09:33,729 --> 00:09:36,527
I'll have to enclose a check first.
- You do and I'll fire you.

197
00:09:36,527 --> 00:09:36,929
 

198
00:09:36,929 --> 00:09:40,399
Your Excellency, the eyes
of the world are upon you.

199
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:40,809
 

200
00:09:40,809 --> 00:09:43,846
Notables from every country
are gathered in your honor.

201
00:09:43,846 --> 00:09:44,249
 

202
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:49,118
This is a gala day for you.
- A gal a day is enough for me.

203
00:09:49,118 --> 00:09:49,569
 

204
00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:51,685
I don't think I could handle any more.

205
00:09:51,685 --> 00:09:52,089
 

206
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:56,162
For our information,
just for illustration,

207
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:56,569
 

208
00:09:56,569 --> 00:10:01,359
tell us how you intend
to run the nation.

209
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:01,769
 

210
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:06,081
These are the laws
of my administration:

211
00:10:06,081 --> 00:10:06,489
 

212
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:10,721
No one's allowed to smoke, or tell a
dirty joke, and whistling's forbidden.

213
00:10:10,721 --> 00:10:11,129
 

214
00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:14,121
We're not allowed to tell
a dirty joke.

215
00:10:14,121 --> 00:10:14,609
 

216
00:10:14,609 --> 00:10:16,998
Hail, hail Freedonia.

217
00:10:16,998 --> 00:10:17,409
 

218
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:21,721
If gum is chewed, the chewer's pursued
and in the hoosegow hidden.

219
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:22,129
 

220
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:24,279
If we should choose to chew,
we'll be pursued.

221
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:24,929
 

222
00:10:24,929 --> 00:10:27,363
If any form of pleasure is exhibited,

223
00:10:27,363 --> 00:10:27,769
 

224
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:29,839
report to me,
and it will be prohibited.

225
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:30,409
 

226
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:33,082
I'll put my foot down,
so shall it be.

227
00:10:33,082 --> 00:10:33,489
 

228
00:10:33,489 --> 00:10:36,322
This is the land of the free!

229
00:10:36,322 --> 00:10:36,969
 

230
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,437
The last man
nearly ruined this place.

231
00:10:39,437 --> 00:10:39,849
 

232
00:10:39,849 --> 00:10:43,762
If you think this country's bad off,
just wait till I get through with it.

233
00:10:43,762 --> 00:10:47,409
 

234
00:10:47,409 --> 00:10:49,798
The country's taxes
must be fixed.

235
00:10:49,798 --> 00:10:50,209
 

236
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:53,167
If you think you're paying too much,
wait till I get through with it.

237
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:59,249
 

238
00:10:59,249 --> 00:11:01,968
I will not stand for anything
that's crooked or unfair.

239
00:11:01,968 --> 00:11:02,369
 

240
00:11:02,369 --> 00:11:05,042
I'm strictly on the up and up,
so everyone beware.

241
00:11:05,042 --> 00:11:05,449
 

242
00:11:05,449 --> 00:11:08,168
If anyone's caught taking graft,
and I don't get my share,

243
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:08,569
 

244
00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:11,527
we stand him up against the wall
and pop goes the weasel.

245
00:11:11,527 --> 00:11:11,929
 

246
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:14,443
So everyone beware,
who's crooked or unfair.

247
00:11:14,443 --> 00:11:14,849
 

248
00:11:14,849 --> 00:11:17,841
No one must take a bit of graft,
unless he gets his share.

249
00:11:17,841 --> 00:11:20,809
 

250
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:23,118
If any man should come between
a husband and his bride,

251
00:11:23,118 --> 00:11:23,529
 

252
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:26,043
we find out which one she prefers
by letting her decide.

253
00:11:26,043 --> 00:11:26,449
 

254
00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:29,202
If she prefers the other man,
the husband steps outside.

255
00:11:29,202 --> 00:11:29,609
 

256
00:11:29,609 --> 00:11:32,919
We stand him up against the wall
and pop goes the weasel.

257
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:36,049
 

258
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:38,688
The husband steps outside,
relinquishes his bride.

259
00:11:38,688 --> 00:11:39,089
 

260
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:41,922
We stand him up against the wall
and take him for a ride.

261
00:11:41,922 --> 00:11:42,329
 

262
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:45,127
You have an appointment
at the House of Representatives.

263
00:11:45,127 --> 00:11:45,529
 

264
00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:48,839
You can't go with your trousers up!
- I can't, eh?

265
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:49,249
 

266
00:11:49,249 --> 00:11:52,639
They'll never catch me any other way!
My car!

267
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,049
 

268
00:11:53,049 --> 00:11:55,279
His Excellency's car!

269
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:55,689
 

270
00:11:55,689 --> 00:11:57,168
His Excellency's car!

271
00:11:57,168 --> 00:12:17,369
 

272
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,883
I'm in a hurry.
Ride like fury.

273
00:12:19,883 --> 00:12:20,289
 

274
00:12:20,289 --> 00:12:23,087
If you run out of gas, get Ethel...
If Ethel runs out, get Mabel!

275
00:12:23,087 --> 00:12:31,569
 

276
00:12:31,569 --> 00:12:34,129
Feels good to be back again.

277
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:48,809
 

278
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,118
I've failed, Ambassador.
- I know!

279
00:12:51,118 --> 00:12:51,529
 

280
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:53,804
I'm sorry.
- You have muddled everything.

281
00:12:53,804 --> 00:12:54,209
 

282
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:57,007
If you'd started the revolution
as I planned,

283
00:12:57,007 --> 00:12:57,409
 

284
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:01,038
I could have stepped in and placed
Freedonia under the Sylvanian flag.

285
00:13:01,038 --> 00:13:01,449
 

286
00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:03,121
But Firefly blocked us.

287
00:13:03,121 --> 00:13:03,529
 

288
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:07,363
You have no idea how popular he is.
- I've known of that, too.

289
00:13:07,363 --> 00:13:07,769
 

290
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:11,808
I have 2 spies shadowing him.
I want to find out something

291
00:13:11,808 --> 00:13:12,209
 

292
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:14,962
to discredit him with the people.

293
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:15,369
 

294
00:13:15,369 --> 00:13:17,599
Chicolini and Pinky are here.

295
00:13:17,599 --> 00:13:18,009
 

296
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:21,240
These are my spies.
Show them in. Wait outside.

297
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:29,209
 

298
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:30,164
We fooled you good!

299
00:13:30,164 --> 00:13:31,129
 

300
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:32,118
Gentlemen!

301
00:13:32,118 --> 00:13:40,489
 

302
00:13:40,489 --> 00:13:43,845
What is this?
- This is spy stuff.

303
00:13:43,845 --> 00:13:50,169
 

304
00:13:50,169 --> 00:13:52,239
Telegram for you...

305
00:13:52,239 --> 00:13:56,729
 

306
00:13:56,729 --> 00:13:59,163
He gets mad, because he can't read.
- I see.

307
00:13:59,163 --> 00:13:59,569
 

308
00:13:59,569 --> 00:14:01,685
We have serious matters to discuss.

309
00:14:01,685 --> 00:14:02,089
 

310
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:04,444
Please, be seated.
- Rock-a-bye...

311
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:04,849
 

312
00:14:04,849 --> 00:14:08,842
Gentlemen...
- Wait. Here, have a cigar.

313
00:14:08,842 --> 00:14:10,369
 

314
00:14:10,369 --> 00:14:14,408
A quarter cigar. I smoked the rest.
- No, thanks. I have my own.

315
00:14:14,408 --> 00:14:14,809
 

316
00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:17,198
Here, try one of these.

317
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:18,409
 

318
00:14:18,409 --> 00:14:20,286
It's no good.

319
00:14:20,286 --> 00:14:27,009
 

320
00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:28,567
That's a good one.

321
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:34,929
 

322
00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:38,763
Now let's concentrate.
Have you been trailing Firefly?

323
00:14:38,763 --> 00:14:39,289
 

324
00:14:39,289 --> 00:14:43,441
Have we been trailing him? My partner
has a nose like a bloodhound.

325
00:14:43,441 --> 00:14:43,849
 

326
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:46,807
Really? - The rest of his face
don't look so good either.

327
00:14:46,807 --> 00:14:48,289
 

328
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:52,601
We find out all about this Firefly.
Look at this. - Very good.

329
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:53,009
 

330
00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:55,079
We must not be disturbed.

331
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:57,169
 

332
00:14:57,169 --> 00:15:00,844
This is an important conference.
I do not wish to be interrupted.

333
00:15:00,844 --> 00:15:01,249
 

334
00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:02,602
Yes, sir.

335
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:05,889
 

336
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:08,278
Gentlemen,
we are not getting anywhere.

337
00:15:08,278 --> 00:15:13,769
 

338
00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:15,202
Out!

339
00:15:15,202 --> 00:15:17,769
 

340
00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:22,445
Please, will you tell me
what you found out about Firefly!

341
00:15:22,445 --> 00:15:22,849
 

342
00:15:22,849 --> 00:15:26,080
You gave us a picture of this man
to follow? - Yes!

343
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,489
 

344
00:15:26,489 --> 00:15:31,165
We get on the job right away. And
in even less than one hour... - Yes?

345
00:15:31,165 --> 00:15:31,569
 

346
00:15:31,569 --> 00:15:33,878
We lose him.
Pretty quick work, huh?

347
00:15:33,878 --> 00:15:34,289
 

348
00:15:34,289 --> 00:15:36,928
I asked you to dig up something.
Oid you bring me

349
00:15:36,928 --> 00:15:37,329
 

350
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:38,648
his record?

351
00:15:38,648 --> 00:15:39,649
 

352
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:41,162
No! No!

353
00:15:41,162 --> 00:15:44,289
 

354
00:15:44,289 --> 00:15:46,598
And the boy gets a cigar.

355
00:15:46,598 --> 00:15:49,649
 

356
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:53,164
Chicolini, I want
a full, detailed report!

357
00:15:53,164 --> 00:15:53,569
 

358
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:57,482
Alright: Monday we watch
Firefly's house, but he no come out.

359
00:15:57,482 --> 00:15:57,889
 

360
00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:00,801
He wasn't home. Tuesday we go
to a ballgame, but he fool us.

361
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:01,209
 

362
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:04,007
Wednesday he go to the ballgame,
be we fool him.

363
00:16:04,007 --> 00:16:04,409
 

364
00:16:04,409 --> 00:16:07,685
We no show up.
Thursday, nobody show up.

365
00:16:07,685 --> 00:16:08,089
 

366
00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:11,798
Friday there was no ballgame,
so we listen to it over the radio.

367
00:16:11,798 --> 00:16:12,209
 

368
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:16,680
Then you didn't shadow Firefly?
- Sure, we shadow him all day.

369
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,089
 

370
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:18,647
When?
- Shadow day.

371
00:16:18,647 --> 00:16:19,209
 

372
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:21,325
That's some joke, eh, boss?

373
00:16:21,325 --> 00:16:22,649
 

374
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,402
What happened on Saturday?

375
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:25,809
 

376
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:28,687
Glad you asked. We follow this man
down to a roadhouse.

377
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:29,089
 

378
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:32,320
He meet a married lady.
- A married lady? - His wife...

379
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:32,729
 

380
00:16:32,729 --> 00:16:35,607
Firefly has no wife.
- No? - No!

381
00:16:35,607 --> 00:16:36,009
 

382
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:39,285
You know what I think, boss? - What?
- We followed the wrong man.

383
00:16:39,285 --> 00:16:39,689
 

384
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:43,079
Gentlemen, I am disappointed.

385
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:43,489
 

386
00:16:43,489 --> 00:16:47,402
I entrusted you with a mission,
and you've failed.

387
00:16:47,402 --> 00:16:47,809
 

388
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:50,767
But I'm giving you one more chance.

389
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:51,169
 

390
00:16:51,169 --> 00:16:56,926
I have credentials here that will
get you into any place in Freedonia.

391
00:16:56,926 --> 00:16:57,729
 

392
00:16:57,729 --> 00:16:59,640
Ah, here we are.

393
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,049
 

394
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:02,722
Are you sure you can trap Firefly?

395
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:06,009
 

396
00:17:06,009 --> 00:17:10,241
This time I expect results.
Good luck.

397
00:17:10,241 --> 00:17:11,609
 

398
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:13,725
Come on, Pinky.
- Goodbye.

399
00:17:13,725 --> 00:17:38,689
 

400
00:17:38,689 --> 00:17:40,281
The meeting's called to order.

401
00:17:40,281 --> 00:17:40,689
 

402
00:17:40,689 --> 00:17:44,967
The Treasury Oepartment's report.
I hope you find it clear.

403
00:17:44,967 --> 00:17:45,369
 

404
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:49,078
Clear? A 4-year-old child
could understand it.

405
00:17:49,078 --> 00:17:49,569
 

406
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:52,641
Find me a 4-year-old-child.
I can't make head or tail of it.

407
00:17:52,641 --> 00:17:53,489
 

408
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,242
Members of the Cabinet,
we'll take up all business.

409
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:56,649
 

410
00:17:56,649 --> 00:17:59,402
I wish to discuss the tarif.
- That's new business.

411
00:17:59,402 --> 00:17:59,809
 

412
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:03,279
No old business? You may take up
new business. - That tarif...

413
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:03,689
 

414
00:18:03,689 --> 00:18:06,567
Too late.
That's already old business.

415
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:06,969
 

416
00:18:06,969 --> 00:18:10,006
As your Secretary of War...
- Out of order!

417
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:10,409
 

418
00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:13,207
Which reminds me, so is the plumbing.
Make a note of that.

419
00:18:13,207 --> 00:18:13,609
 

420
00:18:13,609 --> 00:18:15,486
Never mind. I'll do it myself.

421
00:18:15,486 --> 00:18:18,089
 

422
00:18:18,089 --> 00:18:21,684
The workers of Freedonia
are demanding shorter hours.

423
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:22,089
 

424
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:25,604
We'll start by cutting
their lunch hour to 20 minutes.

425
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,009
 

426
00:18:26,009 --> 00:18:30,002
We must look for a new treasurer.
- You appointed one last week.

427
00:18:30,002 --> 00:18:30,409
 

428
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:31,728
I'm looking for him.

429
00:18:31,728 --> 00:18:32,129
 

430
00:18:32,129 --> 00:18:35,439
Enough of this!
How about taking up the tax?

431
00:18:35,439 --> 00:18:35,849
 

432
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:39,125
How about taking up the carpet?
- We must take up the tax!

433
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:39,529
 

434
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:42,327
Right. You've gotta take up the tacks
before you take up the carpet.

435
00:18:42,327 --> 00:18:42,889
 

436
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:45,483
I give all my energy to my duties,
and what do I get?

437
00:18:45,483 --> 00:18:45,889
 

438
00:18:45,889 --> 00:18:47,368
Awfully tiresome.

439
00:18:47,368 --> 00:18:47,769
 

440
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:51,318
You try my patience.
- You must try mine sometime.

441
00:18:51,318 --> 00:18:51,729
 

442
00:18:51,729 --> 00:18:55,802
That's the last straw! I resign!
I wash my hands of the whole business!

443
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:56,209
 

444
00:18:56,209 --> 00:18:58,484
Good idea.
You can wash your neck, too.

445
00:18:58,484 --> 00:19:00,089
 

446
00:19:00,089 --> 00:19:02,205
Peanuts!

447
00:19:02,205 --> 00:19:15,129
 

448
00:19:15,129 --> 00:19:16,767
Hey, come here!

449
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:17,209
 

450
00:19:17,209 --> 00:19:21,839
Just the guy I wanna see.
What did you find out about Firefly?

451
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:22,249
 

452
00:19:22,249 --> 00:19:25,002
Find out something?
No find out something?

453
00:19:25,002 --> 00:19:25,409
 

454
00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:27,798
You spy on him?
No spy on him?

455
00:19:27,798 --> 00:19:28,689
 

456
00:19:28,689 --> 00:19:32,568
What's the matter, you no say nothing?
What's the matter you no speak?

457
00:19:32,568 --> 00:19:33,609
 

458
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:37,602
Stop this!
What do you find?

459
00:19:37,602 --> 00:19:38,729
 

460
00:19:38,729 --> 00:19:43,086
You acting crazy! Come here.
What're you making a face like this?

461
00:19:43,086 --> 00:19:43,489
 

462
00:19:43,489 --> 00:19:46,526
What's the matter? You wanna fight?

463
00:19:46,526 --> 00:19:46,929
 

464
00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:48,328
I give you a fight.

465
00:19:48,328 --> 00:19:48,729
 

466
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,720
Up the stairs, no downstairs!

467
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,849
 

468
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:52,964
Come on!

469
00:19:52,964 --> 00:19:53,849
 

470
00:19:53,849 --> 00:19:54,964
Who do you think you are?

471
00:19:54,964 --> 00:20:06,009
 

472
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:09,558
What's the idea, fighting here
and driving away my customers!

473
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:09,969
 

474
00:20:09,969 --> 00:20:11,163
You got a mistake.

475
00:20:11,163 --> 00:20:11,569
 

476
00:20:11,569 --> 00:20:14,208
Ain't no fight.
This guy's working for me.

477
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:14,609
 

478
00:20:14,609 --> 00:20:17,999
He tells me nothing.
I ask, why you no speak.

479
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:18,409
 

480
00:20:18,409 --> 00:20:21,958
He make a fight like this.
- What's the idea?

481
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:22,369
 

482
00:20:22,369 --> 00:20:26,362
That's his idea.
I say something, he say nothing.

483
00:20:26,362 --> 00:20:26,769
 

484
00:20:26,769 --> 00:20:28,088
Every time I speak...
- Will you shut up!

485
00:20:28,088 --> 00:20:30,089
 

486
00:20:30,089 --> 00:20:32,922
What're you doing around here?

487
00:20:32,922 --> 00:20:33,329
 

488
00:20:33,329 --> 00:20:34,967
Who are you?

489
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:35,809
 

490
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:39,245
Can't you say...
Can't you say anything?

491
00:20:39,245 --> 00:20:39,649
 

492
00:20:39,649 --> 00:20:42,083
He say nothing...
- Shut up! - I am shut up!

493
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:42,489
 

494
00:20:42,489 --> 00:20:45,322
You no understand. He and I are spies.
He work for me.

495
00:20:45,322 --> 00:20:45,729
 

496
00:20:45,729 --> 00:20:48,004
I want him to find out something,
but he no find out.

497
00:20:48,004 --> 00:20:48,409
 

498
00:20:48,409 --> 00:20:51,481
How am I gonna find out
if he no find out...

499
00:20:51,481 --> 00:20:51,889
 

500
00:20:51,889 --> 00:20:53,959
Will you quit annoying me!
- Alright.

501
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:54,369
 

502
00:20:54,369 --> 00:20:56,837
Just make him stop doing this.

503
00:20:56,837 --> 00:20:58,969
 

504
00:20:58,969 --> 00:21:02,723
I'm gonna tear you
limb from limb...

505
00:21:02,723 --> 00:21:05,849
 

506
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:07,999
I'll do the same...

507
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:18,489
 

508
00:21:18,489 --> 00:21:22,767
I no say one thing.
- No, I must...

509
00:21:22,767 --> 00:22:11,809
 

510
00:22:11,809 --> 00:22:13,765
Now I'm gonna get you!

511
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:19,609
 

512
00:22:19,609 --> 00:22:20,564
What're you doing?

513
00:22:20,564 --> 00:22:24,329
 

514
00:22:24,329 --> 00:22:25,682
Why you...

515
00:22:25,682 --> 00:22:48,329
 

516
00:22:48,329 --> 00:22:51,958
I'll teach you to kick me!
- I know how!

517
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:54,649
 

518
00:22:54,649 --> 00:22:56,844
Stop it!

519
00:22:56,844 --> 00:22:59,649
 

520
00:22:59,649 --> 00:23:01,799
That's good, eh?

521
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:04,929
 

522
00:23:04,929 --> 00:23:06,521
Peanuts!

523
00:23:06,521 --> 00:23:07,569
 

524
00:23:07,569 --> 00:23:08,718
Hey!

525
00:23:08,718 --> 00:23:12,169
 

526
00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:15,366
You wanna be a public nuisance?
- How much does the job pay?

527
00:23:15,366 --> 00:23:15,769
 

528
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,078
I oughtta join the club
and beat you over the head.

529
00:23:18,078 --> 00:23:18,489
 

530
00:23:18,489 --> 00:23:20,639
Peanuts... to you!

531
00:23:20,639 --> 00:23:21,049
 

532
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:25,281
Have you got a license?
- No, but my dog's got a million.

533
00:23:25,281 --> 00:23:25,689
 

534
00:23:25,689 --> 00:23:29,443
He's some smart dog.
He went with Admiral Byrd to the pole.

535
00:23:29,443 --> 00:23:29,849
 

536
00:23:29,849 --> 00:23:31,680
I bet the dog got to the pole first.

537
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,169
 

538
00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:35,127
You win. - Come on up.
I wanna scare the Cabinet.

539
00:23:35,127 --> 00:23:40,529
 

540
00:23:40,529 --> 00:23:44,841
No, he's not in.
Alright, I tell him.

541
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:45,249
 

542
00:23:45,249 --> 00:23:48,366
That was for you. - I'm not in.
I want to talk to you.

543
00:23:48,366 --> 00:23:48,769
 

544
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:53,797
Give up that silly peanut stand, and
I'll get you a soft government job.

545
00:23:53,797 --> 00:23:54,449
 

546
00:23:54,449 --> 00:23:58,965
How about a job in the mint?
- No, I no like a mint.

547
00:23:58,965 --> 00:23:59,369
 

548
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:02,042
What other flavor you got?

549
00:24:02,042 --> 00:24:04,369
 

550
00:24:04,369 --> 00:24:08,282
No, not yet.
Alright, I'll tell him. Goodbye.

551
00:24:08,282 --> 00:24:08,689
 

552
00:24:08,689 --> 00:24:11,203
That was for you again.
- What ever became of me?

553
00:24:11,203 --> 00:24:12,169
 

554
00:24:12,169 --> 00:24:17,243
I should have been back hours ago.
I got a swell job for you, but

555
00:24:17,243 --> 00:24:17,649
 

556
00:24:17,649 --> 00:24:21,801
I have a couple of questions.
What has four pairs of pants,

557
00:24:21,801 --> 00:24:22,209
 

558
00:24:22,209 --> 00:24:26,043
lives in Philadelphia,
and never rains but pours?

559
00:24:26,043 --> 00:24:27,209
 

560
00:24:27,209 --> 00:24:29,086
Good one. I give you 3 guesses.

561
00:24:29,086 --> 00:24:29,489
 

562
00:24:29,489 --> 00:24:33,448
Has 4 pairs of pants, lives in
Philadelphia. Male or female?

563
00:24:33,448 --> 00:24:33,849
 

564
00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:37,444
Oon't think so.
- Is he dead? - Who?

565
00:24:37,444 --> 00:24:37,849
 

566
00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:41,205
I don't know. I give up.
- I give up, too.

567
00:24:41,205 --> 00:24:41,609
 

568
00:24:41,609 --> 00:24:45,397
Now I ask you. What's got
a big, black moustache,

569
00:24:45,397 --> 00:24:45,809
 

570
00:24:45,809 --> 00:24:49,768
smokes a big, black cigar,
and he's a big pain in the neck?

571
00:24:49,768 --> 00:24:50,169
 

572
00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:53,161
Now don't tell me.
Has a big, black moustache,

573
00:24:53,161 --> 00:24:53,849
 

574
00:24:53,849 --> 00:24:57,683
smokes a big, black cigar
and is a big pain...

575
00:24:57,683 --> 00:24:58,649
 

576
00:24:58,649 --> 00:25:01,209
Ooes he wear glasses?
- You guessed it quick.

577
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:01,609
 

578
00:25:01,609 --> 00:25:03,918
Just for that, you don't get the job.
- What job?

579
00:25:03,918 --> 00:25:04,329
 

580
00:25:04,329 --> 00:25:06,889
Secretary of War.
- I take it. - Sold.

581
00:25:06,889 --> 00:25:25,649
 

582
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:28,880
I'd be lost without a telephone!
Oon't go away. I wanna talk to you.

583
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,289
 

584
00:25:29,289 --> 00:25:33,123
Now where were we? Oh yes,
what kind of army should we have?

585
00:25:33,123 --> 00:25:33,529
 

586
00:25:33,529 --> 00:25:36,282
A standing army.

587
00:25:36,282 --> 00:25:37,289
 

588
00:25:37,289 --> 00:25:38,278
Why?

589
00:25:38,278 --> 00:25:38,689
 

590
00:25:38,689 --> 00:25:40,998
Then we save on chairs.

591
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:44,009
 

592
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,601
Peanuts...

593
00:25:45,601 --> 00:25:47,489
 

594
00:25:47,489 --> 00:25:48,604
Scat!

595
00:25:48,604 --> 00:25:57,249
 

596
00:25:57,249 --> 00:25:59,285
Who are you anyway?

597
00:25:59,285 --> 00:26:01,609
 

598
00:26:01,609 --> 00:26:06,319
I don't go in much for modern art.
Got any of the old masters?

599
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:09,809
 

600
00:26:09,809 --> 00:26:13,279
Not bad.
You have her telephone number?

601
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:18,249
 

602
00:26:18,249 --> 00:26:21,639
You could be a big help to me.
Where do you live?

603
00:26:21,639 --> 00:26:24,929
 

604
00:26:24,929 --> 00:26:27,807
Not much of a place,
but it's home.

605
00:26:27,807 --> 00:26:33,409
 

606
00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:37,766
I bet you haven't got
a picture of my grandfather.

607
00:26:37,766 --> 00:26:41,609
 

608
00:26:41,609 --> 00:26:43,361
Not now.

609
00:26:43,361 --> 00:26:43,769
 

610
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:44,804
Some other time.

611
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:56,129
 

612
00:26:56,129 --> 00:26:58,927
Your Excellency...
- Quiet!

613
00:26:58,927 --> 00:26:59,329
 

614
00:26:59,329 --> 00:27:01,923
This letter's the work of Trentino.
He's trying to undermine you.

615
00:27:01,923 --> 00:27:02,329
 

616
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:05,480
What are you doing about it?
- I'll ring his doorbell and run.

617
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:05,889
 

618
00:27:05,889 --> 00:27:08,801
We have to get rid of that man.
I have a plan.

619
00:27:08,801 --> 00:27:09,209
 

620
00:27:09,209 --> 00:27:12,281
Say something to make him mad,
and he'll strike you.

621
00:27:12,281 --> 00:27:12,689
 

622
00:27:12,689 --> 00:27:16,284
And we force him to leave the country.
- Swell. Couldn't I strike him?

623
00:27:16,284 --> 00:27:16,689
 

624
00:27:16,689 --> 00:27:20,204
Ambassador Trentino is sensitive.
Perhaps if you insult him...

625
00:27:20,204 --> 00:27:20,609
 

626
00:27:20,609 --> 00:27:25,160
I said something to Vera Marcal,
and he slapped me.

627
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,569
 

628
00:27:25,569 --> 00:27:29,482
Why didn't Vera slap your face?
- She did. - What did you say?

629
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:32,409
 

630
00:27:32,409 --> 00:27:35,526
You ought to be ashamed.
Where'd you hear that? - You told me.

631
00:27:35,526 --> 00:27:35,929
 

632
00:27:35,929 --> 00:27:40,400
Oh, yes. I should have slapped
Mrs. Teasdale when she told me.

633
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:40,809
 

634
00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:42,720
Where is Trentino?
- At Mrs. Treasdale's teaparty.

635
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,129
 

636
00:27:43,129 --> 00:27:44,960
Was I invited? Take a letter.

637
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,449
 

638
00:27:47,449 --> 00:27:50,486
"You are cordially invited
to attend my teaparty."

639
00:27:50,486 --> 00:27:51,129
 

640
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:55,361
Sign Mrs. Teasdale's name, and
tell her I accept. Come on.

641
00:27:55,361 --> 00:28:02,969
 

642
00:28:02,969 --> 00:28:07,121
I've got an appointment to insult
Ambassador Trentino. Step on it!

643
00:28:07,121 --> 00:28:11,409
 

644
00:28:11,409 --> 00:28:15,448
My 5th trip today,
and I haven't been anywhere yet.

645
00:28:15,448 --> 00:28:27,169
 

646
00:28:27,169 --> 00:28:30,286
You don't seem to be making
progress with Mrs. Teasdale.

647
00:28:30,286 --> 00:28:30,689
 

648
00:28:30,689 --> 00:28:35,763
How? Every time I get her in the mood
to say yes, Firefly pops in.

649
00:28:35,763 --> 00:28:36,169
 

650
00:28:36,169 --> 00:28:40,845
This is your opportunity. He won't
be here today. - Sure?

651
00:28:40,845 --> 00:28:41,249
 

652
00:28:41,249 --> 00:28:46,198
Positive. I helped Mrs. Teasdale
with the invitations. - Oh!

653
00:28:46,198 --> 00:28:47,249
 

654
00:28:47,249 --> 00:28:50,161
His Excellency Rufus T. Firefly!

655
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:50,569
 

656
00:28:50,569 --> 00:28:55,438
Hail, hail Freedonia,

657
00:28:55,438 --> 00:28:55,849
 

658
00:28:55,849 --> 00:29:02,368
land of the brave and free.

659
00:29:02,368 --> 00:29:06,209
 

660
00:29:06,209 --> 00:29:11,158
I've waited for years. I love you.
Can't you see I'm at your feet?

661
00:29:11,158 --> 00:29:11,569
 

662
00:29:11,569 --> 00:29:13,799
When you're done with hers,
start on mine.

663
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:14,209
 

664
00:29:14,209 --> 00:29:17,121
If that isn't an insult!
- Gloria, I love you.

665
00:29:17,121 --> 00:29:17,529
 

666
00:29:17,529 --> 00:29:18,848
I realize you are Ionely.

667
00:29:18,848 --> 00:29:19,249
 

668
00:29:19,249 --> 00:29:23,401
Can't we be by ourselves? - What can
he offer you? Wealth? Family?

669
00:29:23,401 --> 00:29:23,809
 

670
00:29:23,809 --> 00:29:27,404
I can't give you wealth,
but we can have a little family.

671
00:29:27,404 --> 00:29:27,809
 

672
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:31,643
Oh, Rufus! - All I can offer you
is a Rufus over your head.

673
00:29:31,643 --> 00:29:32,049
 

674
00:29:32,049 --> 00:29:37,328
I don't know what to say. - I wouldn't
know what to say either.

675
00:29:37,328 --> 00:29:37,729
 

676
00:29:37,729 --> 00:29:40,721
Maybe you can suggest something.
You do suggest something.

677
00:29:40,721 --> 00:29:41,129
 

678
00:29:41,129 --> 00:29:43,279
A baboon.
- What?

679
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:43,689
 

680
00:29:43,689 --> 00:29:47,443
I'm sorry. It isn't fair
to the rest of the baboons.

681
00:29:47,443 --> 00:29:47,849
 

682
00:29:47,849 --> 00:29:50,966
This man's conduct is inexcusable!
- Gentlemen!

683
00:29:50,966 --> 00:29:51,369
 

684
00:29:51,369 --> 00:29:53,041
I didn't come here to be insulted!

685
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:53,449
 

686
00:29:53,449 --> 00:29:55,485
That's what you think!
- You swine! - Come again?

687
00:29:55,485 --> 00:29:55,889
 

688
00:29:55,889 --> 00:29:59,677
You worm! - Once more?
- You upstart! - That's it!

689
00:29:59,677 --> 00:30:00,609
 

690
00:30:00,609 --> 00:30:04,124
Touché. - This regrettable occurrence
may plunge our countries into war.

691
00:30:04,124 --> 00:30:04,529
 

692
00:30:04,529 --> 00:30:07,521
This is terrible!
- I'm a man of few words.

693
00:30:07,521 --> 00:30:07,929
 

694
00:30:07,929 --> 00:30:09,726
I'm a man of one word: Scram!

695
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:10,129
 

696
00:30:10,129 --> 00:30:12,438
A man doesn't call a Firefly
an upstart!

697
00:30:12,438 --> 00:30:12,849
 

698
00:30:12,849 --> 00:30:15,966
The Mayflower was full
of Fireflys, and a few horseflies.

699
00:30:15,966 --> 00:30:16,369
 

700
00:30:16,369 --> 00:30:19,839
The Fireflys were on the upperdeck,
the horseflies were on the Fireflys.

701
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:21,329
 

702
00:30:21,329 --> 00:30:24,958
Good day, my Sweet.
- I must speak to you.

703
00:30:24,958 --> 00:30:25,369
 

704
00:30:25,369 --> 00:30:29,044
See you at the theater. After you get
there, you're on your own.

705
00:30:29,044 --> 00:30:29,449
 

706
00:30:29,449 --> 00:30:33,362
His Excellency's car!
- His Excellency's car!

707
00:30:33,362 --> 00:30:35,089
 

708
00:30:35,089 --> 00:30:38,718
No, I'm not taking any more chances.
You can only fool a Firefly twice.

709
00:30:38,718 --> 00:30:39,129
 

710
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:41,484
This time you ride in the sidecar.

711
00:30:41,484 --> 00:30:54,489
 

712
00:30:54,489 --> 00:30:56,445
This is the only way to travel.

713
00:30:56,445 --> 00:31:00,129
 

714
00:31:00,129 --> 00:31:01,642
Come here, Pinky.

715
00:31:01,642 --> 00:31:02,529
 

716
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:03,928
Watch the stand.

717
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:04,329
 

718
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,160
Come on, Pastano.

719
00:31:06,160 --> 00:32:30,889
 

720
00:32:30,889 --> 00:32:34,484
I regret the unfortunate affair
with His Excellency, but

721
00:32:34,484 --> 00:32:34,889
 

722
00:32:34,889 --> 00:32:39,246
his attitude left me no alternative.
- Maybe we can still avoid this war.

723
00:32:39,246 --> 00:32:39,649
 

724
00:32:39,649 --> 00:32:41,446
If we only could.
- Yes...

725
00:32:41,446 --> 00:32:41,849
 

726
00:32:41,849 --> 00:32:45,762
Mrs. Teasdale, I've been recalled
by my president.

727
00:32:45,762 --> 00:32:46,169
 

728
00:32:46,169 --> 00:32:48,603
Then it's too late?
- Not if he listens to reason.

729
00:32:48,603 --> 00:32:49,009
 

730
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:52,718
I'm prepared to pocket my pride
and forget, if he is.

731
00:32:52,718 --> 00:32:53,129
 

732
00:32:53,129 --> 00:32:56,599
That's wonderful of you,
but His Excellency won't hear of it.

733
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:57,009
 

734
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:58,806
Perhaps he will listen to you.

735
00:32:58,806 --> 00:32:59,529
 

736
00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:03,317
You think so? - Of course.
- I'll call him.

737
00:33:03,317 --> 00:33:12,569
 

738
00:33:12,569 --> 00:33:17,040
I hate to disturb you. You're
a busy man, but I must see you.

739
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:17,449
 

740
00:33:17,449 --> 00:33:22,364
Where are you? Oh. You can come in
the back way, no one'll see you.

741
00:33:22,364 --> 00:33:23,569
 

742
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:26,402
If you think of it,
bring some cheese.

743
00:33:26,402 --> 00:33:27,369
 

744
00:33:27,369 --> 00:33:31,885
You must come over. I can't tell it
to you over the phone.

745
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:32,289
 

746
00:33:32,289 --> 00:33:36,646
It's that kind of story. You ought
to be ashamed. I'll be right over.

747
00:33:36,646 --> 00:33:37,049
 

748
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:40,405
You'd better wait outside
until I've talked to him.

749
00:33:40,405 --> 00:33:40,809
 

750
00:33:40,809 --> 00:33:43,323
Very well,
we'll be out here if you want us.

751
00:33:43,323 --> 00:33:55,489
 

752
00:33:55,489 --> 00:33:59,277
How'd you get in here?
- I'm sorry to disturb you.

753
00:33:59,277 --> 00:33:59,689
 

754
00:33:59,689 --> 00:34:03,443
Will you ever forgive me? - After
tonight, will you ever forgive me?

755
00:34:03,443 --> 00:34:04,529
 

756
00:34:04,529 --> 00:34:08,363
These plans of war are as valuable
as your life. Pretty cheap.

757
00:34:08,363 --> 00:34:08,769
 

758
00:34:08,769 --> 00:34:11,442
Watch them like kittens.
Have you ever had kittens?

759
00:34:11,442 --> 00:34:11,849
 

760
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:14,238
Of course not.
You run around playing bridge.

761
00:34:14,238 --> 00:34:14,649
 

762
00:34:14,649 --> 00:34:17,561
Can't you see what I'm telling you?
Marry me.

763
00:34:17,561 --> 00:34:17,969
 

764
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:20,563
Why, marry you?
- Take me, and I'll take a vacation.

765
00:34:20,563 --> 00:34:20,969
 

766
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:23,563
I'll need a vacation
if we get married...

767
00:34:23,563 --> 00:34:23,969
 

768
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:26,767
I can see you in the kitchen,
bending over a hot stove.

769
00:34:26,767 --> 00:34:27,169
 

770
00:34:27,169 --> 00:34:29,763
But I can't see the stove.
Say the word,

771
00:34:29,763 --> 00:34:30,169
 

772
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:32,319
and you'll never see me again.

773
00:34:32,319 --> 00:34:32,729
 

774
00:34:32,729 --> 00:34:33,878
Gloria.

775
00:34:33,878 --> 00:34:38,849
 

776
00:34:38,849 --> 00:34:41,841
Rufus, what are you thinking of?

777
00:34:41,841 --> 00:34:42,369
 

778
00:34:42,369 --> 00:34:45,805
All the years I've wasted
collecting stamps.

779
00:34:45,805 --> 00:34:48,129
 

780
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:51,360
You will think me
a sentimental old fluff,

781
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:51,769
 

782
00:34:51,769 --> 00:34:56,285
but would you mind giving me
a lock of your hair? - A lock?

783
00:34:56,285 --> 00:34:57,849
 

784
00:34:57,849 --> 00:35:01,637
I had no idea... - I'm letting you off
easy. I was gonna ask for the wig.

785
00:35:01,637 --> 00:35:08,489
 

786
00:35:08,489 --> 00:35:12,846
You've come to ask for clemency?
- He is on a friendly visit.

787
00:35:12,846 --> 00:35:13,249
 

788
00:35:13,249 --> 00:35:17,800
He's had a change of heart.
- He's still got the same face!

789
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,569
 

790
00:35:18,569 --> 00:35:22,005
I'm willing to forget, if you are.
- Forget?

791
00:35:22,005 --> 00:35:22,409
 

792
00:35:22,409 --> 00:35:25,799
You ask me to forget?
A Firefly never forgets.

793
00:35:25,799 --> 00:35:26,209
 

794
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:29,565
My ancestors would rise from their
graves. I'd have to bury them again.

795
00:35:29,565 --> 00:35:29,969
 

796
00:35:29,969 --> 00:35:33,484
Nothing doing. I'm going to clean
my bed. I'm expecting company.

797
00:35:33,484 --> 00:35:33,889
 

798
00:35:33,889 --> 00:35:36,323
Please, wait.
- Let go, you bully!

799
00:35:36,323 --> 00:35:38,449
 

800
00:35:38,449 --> 00:35:40,565
I'm willing to do anything
to prevent this war.

801
00:35:40,565 --> 00:35:40,969
 

802
00:35:40,969 --> 00:35:43,802
Too late. I've already paid rent
on the battlefield.

803
00:35:43,802 --> 00:35:44,209
 

804
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:49,329
Isn't there something I can do?
- I'll talk to you about that later.

805
00:35:49,329 --> 00:35:49,729
 

806
00:35:49,729 --> 00:35:53,608
Won't you reconsider?
Please, relent... for my sake.

807
00:35:53,608 --> 00:35:54,009
 

808
00:35:54,009 --> 00:35:57,763
I am a little headstrong.
I come by it honestly.

809
00:35:57,763 --> 00:35:58,169
 

810
00:35:58,169 --> 00:36:01,605
My father was a Headstrong.
My mother was a little Armstrong.

811
00:36:01,605 --> 00:36:02,009
 

812
00:36:02,009 --> 00:36:05,604
The Headstrongs married the Armstrongs
and darkies were born.

813
00:36:05,604 --> 00:36:07,209
 

814
00:36:07,209 --> 00:36:10,565
Silly to lose my temper on account of
the little thing you called me.

815
00:36:10,565 --> 00:36:10,969
 

816
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:13,483
Little thing?
What did I call you?

817
00:36:13,483 --> 00:36:14,569
 

818
00:36:14,569 --> 00:36:17,003
I don't remember what it was.

819
00:36:17,003 --> 00:36:17,969
 

820
00:36:17,969 --> 00:36:21,803
You mean "worm"?
- No, that wasn't it.

821
00:36:21,803 --> 00:36:22,369
 

822
00:36:22,369 --> 00:36:27,284
I know..."swine"?
- No, it was a seven-letter word.

823
00:36:27,284 --> 00:36:28,169
 

824
00:36:28,169 --> 00:36:31,002
Oh yes! "Upstart".
- That's it!

825
00:36:31,002 --> 00:36:31,409
 

826
00:36:31,409 --> 00:36:33,604
This man is impossible.
An outrage!

827
00:36:33,604 --> 00:36:34,009
 

828
00:36:34,009 --> 00:36:37,684
My course is clear.
This means war! You runt!

829
00:36:37,684 --> 00:36:38,089
 

830
00:36:38,089 --> 00:36:39,681
I still like "upstart" the best.

831
00:36:39,681 --> 00:36:40,089
 

832
00:36:40,089 --> 00:36:43,559
I shan't stay longer.
- Never darken my towels again.

833
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:43,969
 

834
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:46,483
My hat!
- My towel!

835
00:36:46,483 --> 00:36:48,289
 

836
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:52,567
Freedonia's war plans are
in Mrs. Teasdale's possession.

837
00:36:52,567 --> 00:36:52,969
 

838
00:36:52,969 --> 00:36:54,960
I must get hold of them.
- But how?

839
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,369
 

840
00:36:55,369 --> 00:36:59,567
We have a guest
in Mrs. Teasdale's house, Miss Marcal.

841
00:36:59,567 --> 00:37:01,009
 

842
00:37:01,009 --> 00:37:04,763
Oo you mind waiting outside?
I'll join you. - Certainly.

843
00:37:04,763 --> 00:37:09,569
 

844
00:37:09,569 --> 00:37:11,048
Excuse me.

845
00:37:11,048 --> 00:37:20,489
 

846
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:22,605
Yes, I am alone... No, not yet.

847
00:37:22,605 --> 00:37:23,009
 

848
00:37:23,009 --> 00:37:26,638
We've got to work fast.
You must get hold of those plans.

849
00:37:26,638 --> 00:37:27,049
 

850
00:37:27,049 --> 00:37:29,517
Chicolini and his partner
should be there soon.

851
00:37:29,517 --> 00:37:29,929
 

852
00:37:29,929 --> 00:37:34,207
But I must be careful.
There's another guest here.

853
00:37:34,207 --> 00:37:34,609
 

854
00:37:34,609 --> 00:37:37,840
Firefly? I don't know.
I think he's asleep.

855
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:50,889
 

856
00:37:50,889 --> 00:37:52,607
Ring the bell.

857
00:37:52,607 --> 00:37:55,849
 

858
00:37:55,849 --> 00:37:57,362
Push the button.

859
00:37:57,362 --> 00:38:46,209
 

860
00:38:46,209 --> 00:38:49,599
You got the plans?
- No, but they're in the house.

861
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:50,569
 

862
00:38:50,569 --> 00:38:54,562
Oon't make a sound.
If you're found, you're lost.

863
00:38:54,562 --> 00:38:54,969
 

864
00:38:54,969 --> 00:38:57,802
You're crazy.
How can I be lost if I'm found?

865
00:38:57,802 --> 00:38:59,969
 

866
00:38:59,969 --> 00:39:01,766
Got a flashlight?

867
00:39:01,766 --> 00:39:06,649
 

868
00:39:06,649 --> 00:39:10,324
If they catch you, you'll be
court-martialed and shot.

869
00:39:10,324 --> 00:39:10,729
 

870
00:39:10,729 --> 00:39:11,844
Vera!

871
00:39:11,844 --> 00:39:15,769
 

872
00:39:15,769 --> 00:39:21,207
I must go. Remember,
don't make a sound.

873
00:39:21,207 --> 00:40:09,529
 

874
00:40:09,529 --> 00:40:15,240
Stay here, but keep quiet. If we get
caught, we get court-plastered.

875
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:24,049
 

876
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:26,279
I'm worried. I can't sleep.

877
00:40:26,279 --> 00:40:26,689
 

878
00:40:26,689 --> 00:40:30,568
What? You're worried?
You can't sleep?

879
00:40:30,568 --> 00:40:30,969
 

880
00:40:30,969 --> 00:40:32,925
Fine. Now you woke me up.

881
00:40:32,925 --> 00:40:33,329
 

882
00:40:33,329 --> 00:40:36,765
I won't rest until the plans
are back in your hands.

883
00:40:36,765 --> 00:40:38,769
 

884
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,521
Please, come over and get them.

885
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:40,929
 

886
00:40:40,929 --> 00:40:42,601
The plans? I'll be right over.

887
00:40:42,601 --> 00:40:50,289
 

888
00:40:50,289 --> 00:40:51,688
Let me out!

889
00:40:51,688 --> 00:40:57,529
 

890
00:40:57,529 --> 00:41:01,317
Let me out!
Or throw me a magazine!

891
00:41:01,317 --> 00:41:05,689
 

892
00:41:05,689 --> 00:41:10,763
So that's your game. I'll huff and
puff and blow your door in.

893
00:41:10,763 --> 00:41:18,329
 

894
00:41:18,329 --> 00:41:19,728
Come in.

895
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:21,929
 

896
00:41:21,929 --> 00:41:27,049
I'm so glad you've come.
- I'm glad, too. Got the plans?

897
00:41:27,049 --> 00:41:27,689
 

898
00:41:27,689 --> 00:41:31,443
You sound so strange.
Why are you talking like that?

899
00:41:31,443 --> 00:41:31,849
 

900
00:41:31,849 --> 00:41:35,637
Maybe sometime I go to Italy,
and I'm practicing the language.

901
00:41:35,637 --> 00:41:44,209
 

902
00:41:44,209 --> 00:41:47,724
I'll see my lawyer about this
as soon as he graduates.

903
00:41:47,724 --> 00:41:49,809
 

904
00:41:49,809 --> 00:41:52,767
Your dialect is perfect.
I could listen to you all night.

905
00:41:52,767 --> 00:41:53,169
 

906
00:41:53,169 --> 00:41:56,445
But I can't stay all night.
Where's the plans?

907
00:41:56,445 --> 00:41:56,849
 

908
00:41:56,849 --> 00:41:59,647
In the safe, downstairs.
I'll write out the combination.

909
00:41:59,647 --> 00:42:11,609
 

910
00:42:11,609 --> 00:42:15,966
There you are. Here's the combination.
Is that clear?

911
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:18,089
 

912
00:42:18,089 --> 00:42:20,284
Anything else you want to know?

913
00:42:20,284 --> 00:42:20,929
 

914
00:42:20,929 --> 00:42:23,727
What's the matter with you?
Have you lost your voice?

915
00:42:23,727 --> 00:42:24,969
 

916
00:42:24,969 --> 00:42:27,039
Let me get you a glass of water.

917
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:32,849
 

918
00:42:32,849 --> 00:42:36,524
Here's your water...
What in the world's the matter?

919
00:42:36,524 --> 00:42:40,729
 

920
00:42:40,729 --> 00:42:44,199
I thought you'd left.
- I no leave.

921
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:44,609
 

922
00:42:44,609 --> 00:42:48,966
But I saw you with my own eyes. - Who
you believe? Me or your own eyes?

923
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:51,249
 

924
00:42:51,249 --> 00:42:57,518
This excitement's too much. I feel
faint. - I'll get you water.

925
00:42:57,518 --> 00:43:12,369
 

926
00:43:12,369 --> 00:43:16,521
How about my glass of water?
- I give up. How about it?

927
00:43:16,521 --> 00:44:05,489
 

928
00:44:05,489 --> 00:44:07,684
What's that?
- Sounds to me like mice.

929
00:44:07,684 --> 00:44:08,089
 

930
00:44:08,089 --> 00:44:12,287
Mice don't play music.
- How about the old "Micetro"?

931
00:44:12,287 --> 00:44:31,769
 

932
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:34,920
Get me headquarters.
Not hindquarters... headquarters.

933
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,649
 

934
00:44:36,649 --> 00:44:39,163
Rush the guards over,
and have 'em surround the house.

935
00:44:39,163 --> 00:47:35,649
 

936
00:47:35,649 --> 00:47:38,163
His Excellency, Rufus T. Firefly.

937
00:47:38,163 --> 00:47:38,569
 

938
00:47:38,569 --> 00:47:46,601
Hail, hail Freedonia,
land of the brave and free.

939
00:47:46,601 --> 00:47:58,329
 

940
00:47:58,329 --> 00:48:02,720
Lieutenant, why weren't the indictment
papers in my portfolio?

941
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,129
 

942
00:48:03,129 --> 00:48:05,643
I didn't think
they were important.

943
00:48:05,643 --> 00:48:06,049
 

944
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:10,281
You didn't think so?
I had my dessert in those papers!

945
00:48:10,281 --> 00:48:10,689
 

946
00:48:10,689 --> 00:48:12,919
Take this bottle back
and get 2 cents for it.

947
00:48:12,919 --> 00:48:14,889
 

948
00:48:14,889 --> 00:48:17,847
Hello, boss! - Chicolini,
I bet you 8 to one we find you guilty.

949
00:48:17,847 --> 00:48:18,249
 

950
00:48:18,249 --> 00:48:21,446
That's no good. I can get
10 to one at the barber shop.

951
00:48:21,446 --> 00:48:21,969
 

952
00:48:21,969 --> 00:48:25,439
You're charged with high treason.
If found guilty, you'll be shot.

953
00:48:25,439 --> 00:48:25,849
 

954
00:48:25,849 --> 00:48:29,125
I object.
- On what grounds?

955
00:48:29,125 --> 00:48:29,529
 

956
00:48:29,529 --> 00:48:30,928
I couldn't think of anything else.

957
00:48:30,928 --> 00:48:31,369
 

958
00:48:31,369 --> 00:48:34,088
Objection sustained.
- You sustained the objection?

959
00:48:34,088 --> 00:48:34,489
 

960
00:48:34,489 --> 00:48:37,447
I couldn't think of anything either.
Why don't you object?

961
00:48:37,447 --> 00:48:38,049
 

962
00:48:38,049 --> 00:48:40,005
When were you born?

963
00:48:40,005 --> 00:48:40,529
 

964
00:48:40,529 --> 00:48:42,724
I don't know.
I was just a little baby.

965
00:48:42,724 --> 00:48:43,129
 

966
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:46,724
Oid you try to sell Freedonia's
secret war code and plans?

967
00:48:46,724 --> 00:48:47,129
 

968
00:48:47,129 --> 00:48:49,563
I sold the code
and 2 pairs of plans.

969
00:48:49,563 --> 00:48:51,249
 

970
00:48:51,249 --> 00:48:54,685
That's some joke, huh?
- 20 to one we find you guilty.

971
00:48:54,685 --> 00:48:55,089
 

972
00:48:55,089 --> 00:48:57,159
Have you anyone to defend you?

973
00:48:57,159 --> 00:48:57,569
 

974
00:48:57,569 --> 00:49:02,723
It's no use. I offered 18 dollars,
but I no find somebody to defend me.

975
00:49:02,723 --> 00:49:03,129
 

976
00:49:03,129 --> 00:49:06,883
My friends,
this man's case moves me deeply.

977
00:49:06,883 --> 00:49:07,889
 

978
00:49:07,889 --> 00:49:09,481
Look at Chicolini.

979
00:49:09,481 --> 00:49:09,889
 

980
00:49:09,889 --> 00:49:14,599
He sits there alone,
an abject figure. - I abject.

981
00:49:14,599 --> 00:49:15,929
 

982
00:49:15,929 --> 00:49:20,207
Look at Chicolini. He sits there
alone, a pitiable object.

983
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:20,609
 

984
00:49:20,609 --> 00:49:22,565
Let's see you get outta that one.

985
00:49:22,565 --> 00:49:22,969
 

986
00:49:22,969 --> 00:49:24,448
Surrounded by unfriendly faces.

987
00:49:24,448 --> 00:49:24,849
 

988
00:49:24,849 --> 00:49:27,841
A number from one and ten.
- 11? - Right.

989
00:49:27,841 --> 00:49:28,249
 

990
00:49:28,249 --> 00:49:31,525
What has a trunk
but no key,

991
00:49:31,525 --> 00:49:32,289
 

992
00:49:32,289 --> 00:49:33,881
weighs 2,000 pounds...

993
00:49:33,881 --> 00:49:34,289
 

994
00:49:34,289 --> 00:49:37,406
Irrelevant!
- Elephant! That's the answer!

995
00:49:37,406 --> 00:49:37,809
 

996
00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:39,686
A lot of elephants in the circus.

997
00:49:39,686 --> 00:49:40,089
 

998
00:49:40,089 --> 00:49:42,523
That testimony we can eliminate.
- I'll take some.

999
00:49:42,523 --> 00:49:42,929
 

1000
00:49:42,929 --> 00:49:46,638
You'll take what?
- A cold glass of lemonade.

1001
00:49:46,638 --> 00:49:47,049
 

1002
00:49:47,049 --> 00:49:48,721
Hey, boss, I'm going good.

1003
00:49:48,721 --> 00:49:49,129
 

1004
00:49:49,129 --> 00:49:53,042
He may talk like an idiot
and look like an idiot,

1005
00:49:53,042 --> 00:49:53,449
 

1006
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:55,804
but he really is an idiot.

1007
00:49:55,804 --> 00:49:56,209
 

1008
00:49:56,209 --> 00:49:59,167
Send him back
to his father and brothers,

1009
00:49:59,167 --> 00:49:59,569
 

1010
00:49:59,569 --> 00:50:02,527
who are waiting for him with open arms
in the penitentiary.

1011
00:50:02,527 --> 00:50:02,929
 

1012
00:50:02,929 --> 00:50:05,921
Give him 10 years in Leavenworth
or 11 years in Twelveworth.

1013
00:50:05,921 --> 00:50:06,329
 

1014
00:50:06,329 --> 00:50:08,604
I'll take 5 and 10 in Woolworth.

1015
00:50:08,604 --> 00:50:09,009
 

1016
00:50:09,009 --> 00:50:11,239
I wanted to get rid of habeas corpus.
I should have gotten rid of you.

1017
00:50:11,239 --> 00:50:11,649
 

1018
00:50:11,649 --> 00:50:13,560
I object.
- Even I object. - I object, too.

1019
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:13,969
 

1020
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,038
You can't object!

1021
00:50:15,038 --> 00:50:15,449
 

1022
00:50:15,449 --> 00:50:19,488
You're Excellency, General Cooper says
that the Sylvanian troops

1023
00:50:19,488 --> 00:50:19,889
 

1024
00:50:19,889 --> 00:50:22,608
are about to land on Freedonia's soil.
This means war.

1025
00:50:22,608 --> 00:50:23,009
 

1026
00:50:23,009 --> 00:50:26,001
War would mean
a increase in taxes!

1027
00:50:26,001 --> 00:50:26,409
 

1028
00:50:26,409 --> 00:50:31,278
I got an uncle that lives in Texas.
- No, taxes, money, dollars.

1029
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:31,689
 

1030
00:50:31,689 --> 00:50:34,203
That's where my uncle lives!
Oallas, Texas.

1031
00:50:34,203 --> 00:50:37,729
 

1032
00:50:37,729 --> 00:50:39,845
More bad news.

1033
00:50:39,845 --> 00:50:43,129
 

1034
00:50:43,129 --> 00:50:45,438
Oidn't I tell you?
- Your Excellency.

1035
00:50:45,438 --> 00:50:45,849
 

1036
00:50:45,849 --> 00:50:48,761
What's on your mind, babe?
- On behalf of Freedonia's women,

1037
00:50:48,761 --> 00:50:49,169
 

1038
00:50:49,169 --> 00:50:53,367
I make one final effort
to prevent war. - No kidding?

1039
00:50:53,367 --> 00:50:53,769
 

1040
00:50:53,769 --> 00:50:58,081
Trentino says that Sylvania
doesn't want war either. - Either.

1041
00:50:58,081 --> 00:50:58,489
 

1042
00:50:58,489 --> 00:51:00,878
Ooesn't want war either.
- Either.

1043
00:51:00,878 --> 00:51:01,289
 

1044
00:51:01,289 --> 00:51:02,438
Skip it.

1045
00:51:02,438 --> 00:51:02,849
 

1046
00:51:02,849 --> 00:51:06,319
I've asked the ambassador to come,
because we both felt

1047
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:06,729
 

1048
00:51:06,729 --> 00:51:11,200
that a friendly conference
would settle everything peacefully.

1049
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:11,609
 

1050
00:51:11,609 --> 00:51:14,567
He'll be here any moment.
- You did a noble deed.

1051
00:51:14,567 --> 00:51:14,969
 

1052
00:51:14,969 --> 00:51:18,359
I'd be unworthy of the high trust
if I didn't do everything

1053
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:18,769
 

1054
00:51:18,769 --> 00:51:21,078
to keep our beloved Freedonia
at peace with the world.

1055
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:21,489
 

1056
00:51:21,489 --> 00:51:25,482
I'd be happy to meet him
and offer him the right hand

1057
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:25,889
 

1058
00:51:25,889 --> 00:51:29,165
of good fellowship. I feel sure
he will accept this gesture

1059
00:51:29,165 --> 00:51:29,569
 

1060
00:51:29,569 --> 00:51:31,480
in the spirit with which it's offered.

1061
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:31,889
 

1062
00:51:31,889 --> 00:51:35,643
But suppose he doesn't? A fine thing!
I hold out my hand,

1063
00:51:35,643 --> 00:51:36,049
 

1064
00:51:36,049 --> 00:51:39,041
and he refuses to accept it.
That'll add a lot to my prestige.

1065
00:51:39,041 --> 00:51:39,449
 

1066
00:51:39,449 --> 00:51:41,963
Me, the head of a country,
snubbed by an ambassador!

1067
00:51:41,963 --> 00:51:42,369
 

1068
00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:46,567
Who does he think he is? To make a sap
out of me in front of my people.

1069
00:51:46,567 --> 00:51:46,969
 

1070
00:51:46,969 --> 00:51:50,962
I hold out my hand,
and that hyena refuses to accept it.

1071
00:51:50,962 --> 00:51:51,369
 

1072
00:51:51,369 --> 00:51:57,080
Why, the cheap swine! He'll
never get away with it! - Please!

1073
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:57,609
 

1074
00:51:57,609 --> 00:52:00,407
So, you refuse
to shake hands with me, eh?

1075
00:52:00,407 --> 00:52:00,809
 

1076
00:52:00,809 --> 00:52:04,563
This is the last straw!
No turning back! This means war!

1077
00:52:04,563 --> 00:52:08,289
 

1078
00:52:08,289 --> 00:52:09,404
Then it's war!

1079
00:52:09,404 --> 00:52:09,809
 

1080
00:52:09,809 --> 00:52:14,599
Then it's war! Gather the forces!
Harness the horses! It's war!

1081
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:17,369
 

1082
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:21,044
Freedonia's going to war...

1083
00:52:21,044 --> 00:52:21,449
 

1084
00:52:21,449 --> 00:52:24,486
At last our country's going to war.

1085
00:52:24,486 --> 00:52:24,889
 

1086
00:52:24,889 --> 00:52:26,607
We're going to war!

1087
00:52:26,607 --> 00:52:27,009
 

1088
00:52:27,009 --> 00:52:29,648
We think
our country's going to war.

1089
00:52:29,648 --> 00:52:30,049
 

1090
00:52:30,049 --> 00:52:32,517
We're going to war!
- A fact we can't ignore.

1091
00:52:32,517 --> 00:52:32,929
 

1092
00:52:32,929 --> 00:52:36,717
We're going to war.
A fact we can't ignore.

1093
00:52:36,717 --> 00:52:37,129
 

1094
00:52:37,129 --> 00:52:41,122
I think they think
we're going to war.

1095
00:52:41,122 --> 00:52:42,769
 

1096
00:52:42,769 --> 00:52:45,522
I think they think
we're going to war.

1097
00:52:45,522 --> 00:53:20,009
 

1098
00:53:20,009 --> 00:53:22,682
To war! To war!

1099
00:53:22,682 --> 00:53:57,409
 

1100
00:53:57,409 --> 00:54:03,518
They got guns, we got guns,
all God's chillun got guns...

1101
00:54:03,518 --> 00:54:03,929
 

1102
00:54:03,929 --> 00:54:10,607
We're gonna walk over the battlefield,
'cause all God's chillun got guns.

1103
00:54:10,607 --> 00:54:11,009
 

1104
00:54:11,009 --> 00:54:14,399
Hail Freedonia,
don't you cry for me.

1105
00:54:14,399 --> 00:54:14,809
 

1106
00:54:14,809 --> 00:54:18,518
I'll be comin' round the mountain
with a banjo on my knee.

1107
00:54:18,518 --> 00:54:46,489
 

1108
00:54:46,489 --> 00:54:49,481
To war, to war,
we know we gotta go.

1109
00:54:49,481 --> 00:54:49,889
 

1110
00:54:49,889 --> 00:54:52,687
To war! To war!

1111
00:54:52,687 --> 00:55:02,329
 

1112
00:55:02,329 --> 00:55:05,639
To war! To war!
We soon will say goodbye.

1113
00:55:05,639 --> 00:55:06,049
 

1114
00:55:06,049 --> 00:55:09,166
Oh how we'd cry for Firefly
if Firefly should die.

1115
00:55:09,166 --> 00:55:27,649
 

1116
00:55:27,649 --> 00:55:30,322
There'll be 2 lamps
if the enemy is coming by land.

1117
00:55:30,322 --> 00:55:30,729
 

1118
00:55:30,729 --> 00:55:32,765
One if they're coming by sea.

1119
00:55:32,765 --> 00:55:36,609
 

1120
00:55:36,609 --> 00:55:39,646
They've doublecrossed me!
They're coming by land and sea.

1121
00:55:39,646 --> 00:55:40,129
 

1122
00:55:40,129 --> 00:55:42,768
Ride through every village and town,
wake every citizen.

1123
00:55:42,768 --> 00:55:43,169
 

1124
00:55:43,169 --> 00:55:47,003
Tell them
the enemy comes from afar...

1125
00:55:47,003 --> 00:55:47,409
 

1126
00:55:47,409 --> 00:55:49,286
Be off, my lad!

1127
00:55:49,286 --> 00:56:39,849
 

1128
00:56:39,849 --> 00:56:41,919
My husband! Hide in here!

1129
00:56:41,919 --> 00:56:49,449
 

1130
00:56:49,449 --> 00:56:53,328
Freedonia's going to war.
- I'm going to take a bath.

1131
00:56:53,328 --> 00:58:02,409
 

1132
00:58:02,409 --> 00:58:05,765
Clear all wires. The enemy
has captured Hill 27 and 28,

1133
00:58:05,765 --> 00:58:06,169
 

1134
00:58:06,169 --> 00:58:07,841
throwing 13 hillbillies out of work.

1135
00:58:07,841 --> 00:58:08,249
 

1136
00:58:08,249 --> 00:58:10,683
2 snipers cut into our machine-gun
nest and laid an egg.

1137
00:58:10,683 --> 00:58:11,089
 

1138
00:58:11,089 --> 00:58:14,001
Send reinforcements.
Send the call collect.

1139
00:58:14,001 --> 00:58:14,929
 

1140
00:58:14,929 --> 00:58:18,888
Our men are being badly beaten.
I suggest we dig trenches.

1141
00:58:18,888 --> 00:58:19,289
 

1142
00:58:19,289 --> 00:58:22,406
There isn't time
to dig trenches.

1143
00:58:22,406 --> 00:58:22,809
 

1144
00:58:22,809 --> 00:58:24,765
We'll buy 'em ready-made. Here.
- Yes, sir.

1145
00:58:24,765 --> 00:58:25,169
 

1146
00:58:25,169 --> 00:58:28,286
Get 'em this high, and our soldiers
won't need pants. - Yes, sir.

1147
00:58:28,286 --> 00:58:28,689
 

1148
00:58:28,689 --> 00:58:31,601
No, this high, and we won't need
soldiers. - Yes, sir.

1149
00:58:31,601 --> 00:58:32,009
 

1150
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:34,398
Chicolini, I'm counting on you.

1151
00:58:34,398 --> 00:58:34,809
 

1152
00:58:34,809 --> 00:58:38,438
There's a nest near Hill 28. I want it
cleaned out. - I'll tell the janitor.

1153
00:58:38,438 --> 00:58:39,649
 

1154
00:58:39,649 --> 00:58:43,767
Message from the front.
- Oon't we ever get one from the side?

1155
00:58:43,767 --> 00:58:46,249
 

1156
00:58:46,249 --> 00:58:48,809
What is it?
- A gas attack.

1157
00:58:48,809 --> 00:58:49,209
 

1158
00:58:49,209 --> 00:58:52,565
Take a spoon of bicarbonate soda
and water. - Yes, sir.

1159
00:58:52,565 --> 00:58:56,449
 

1160
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:59,964
Any answer to that message? - No.
- Oon't send it.

1161
00:58:59,964 --> 00:59:09,689
 

1162
00:59:09,689 --> 00:59:13,602
This is the last straw!
Where's my Stradivarius? - Here.

1163
00:59:13,602 --> 00:59:14,209
 

1164
00:59:14,209 --> 00:59:17,281
I'll show them they can't fiddle
with old Firefly.

1165
00:59:17,281 --> 00:59:21,929
 

1166
00:59:21,929 --> 00:59:24,762
Look at 'em run! Now we're at war!
- Your Excellency!

1167
00:59:24,762 --> 00:59:25,409
 

1168
00:59:25,409 --> 00:59:27,286
They're fleeing like rats!
- But sir...

1169
00:59:27,286 --> 00:59:27,689
 

1170
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:29,805
I'll give myself the Firefly medal.

1171
00:59:29,805 --> 00:59:30,209
 

1172
00:59:30,209 --> 00:59:32,882
You're shooting your own men.
- What?

1173
00:59:32,882 --> 00:59:33,289
 

1174
00:59:33,289 --> 00:59:35,200
You're shooting your own men.

1175
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:35,609
 

1176
00:59:35,609 --> 00:59:39,682
Here's 5 dollars. Keep it under your
hat. No, I'll keep it under mine.

1177
00:59:39,682 --> 00:59:40,089
 

1178
00:59:40,089 --> 00:59:44,446
We gotta have more men! - Oon't be
alarmed. We're looking for volunteers.

1179
00:59:44,446 --> 00:59:44,849
 

1180
00:59:44,849 --> 00:59:49,320
Join the army,
see the navy.

1181
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,209
 

1182
00:59:51,209 --> 00:59:54,485
The army's morale is crumbling.
The men are breaking ranks.

1183
00:59:54,485 --> 00:59:54,889
 

1184
00:59:54,889 --> 00:59:57,562
Where is the Secretary of War?
- Where is the Secretary of War?

1185
00:59:57,562 --> 00:59:57,969
 

1186
00:59:57,969 --> 01:00:01,757
The soldiers are waiting for his
orders. - The Secretary of War!

1187
01:00:01,757 --> 01:00:07,289
 

1188
01:00:07,289 --> 01:00:11,168
Oecent of you to dop in.
Our army is facing defeat.

1189
01:00:11,168 --> 01:00:11,569
 

1190
01:00:11,569 --> 01:00:13,958
What do you intend to do?
- I've done it. - What?

1191
01:00:13,958 --> 01:00:14,369
 

1192
01:00:14,369 --> 01:00:17,839
Changed to the other side.
- What're you doing here?

1193
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:18,249
 

1194
01:00:18,249 --> 01:00:20,001
The food's better over here.

1195
01:00:20,001 --> 01:00:25,449
 

1196
01:00:25,449 --> 01:00:28,566
Chicolini, I need you.
What'll it take to come back over?

1197
01:00:28,566 --> 01:00:28,969
 

1198
01:00:28,969 --> 01:00:31,039
I'll take a vacation.
- You're hired.

1199
01:00:31,039 --> 01:00:31,449
 

1200
01:00:31,449 --> 01:00:35,567
Go out on that battlefield and
lead those men to victory.

1201
01:00:35,567 --> 01:00:37,209
 

1202
01:00:37,209 --> 01:00:41,680
Not unless I was in one those big
iron things. What you call 'em?

1203
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:42,089
 

1204
01:00:42,089 --> 01:00:44,045
Tanks.
- You're welcome.

1205
01:00:44,045 --> 01:00:45,409
 

1206
01:00:45,409 --> 01:00:48,765
You must come here at once.
We're in danger.

1207
01:00:48,765 --> 01:00:49,169
 

1208
01:00:49,169 --> 01:00:51,000
There's no danger here.

1209
01:00:51,000 --> 01:01:12,089
 

1210
01:01:12,089 --> 01:01:15,399
Wait, I wanna find out something.

1211
01:01:15,399 --> 01:01:18,609
 

1212
01:01:18,609 --> 01:01:20,839
Just as I thought. Coast is clear.

1213
01:01:20,839 --> 01:01:24,129
 

1214
01:01:24,129 --> 01:01:27,121
You're fighting for this woman's
honor. More than she ever did.

1215
01:01:27,121 --> 01:01:27,529
 

1216
01:01:27,529 --> 01:01:29,281
Your Excellency...

1217
01:01:29,281 --> 01:01:29,689
 

1218
01:01:29,689 --> 01:01:32,283
There goes my gun.
Run out and get it.

1219
01:01:32,283 --> 01:01:32,689
 

1220
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:36,887
Our ammunition supplies are low.
- Man the boats! I'll get help!

1221
01:01:36,887 --> 01:01:44,449
 

1222
01:01:44,449 --> 01:01:48,442
Calling all nations...
This is Rufus T...

1223
01:01:48,442 --> 01:01:49,329
 

1224
01:01:49,329 --> 01:01:51,923
Rufus T. Firefly,
through courtesy of the enemy...

1225
01:01:51,923 --> 01:01:52,369
 

1226
01:01:52,369 --> 01:01:53,563
We're in a mess!

1227
01:01:53,563 --> 01:01:53,969
 

1228
01:01:53,969 --> 01:01:57,484
Rush to Freedonia. 3 men and 1 woman
trapped in a building.

1229
01:01:57,484 --> 01:01:57,889
 

1230
01:01:57,889 --> 01:02:00,562
If you can't send help,
send 2 more women.

1231
01:02:00,562 --> 01:02:00,969
 

1232
01:02:00,969 --> 01:02:02,402
Make it 3 more women.

1233
01:02:02,402 --> 01:02:03,769
 

1234
01:02:03,769 --> 01:02:07,000
We can't hold out much longer.
We must have help.

1235
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:12,409
 

1236
01:02:12,409 --> 01:02:16,482
One of us has to get word
to General Cooper...

1237
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:17,089
 

1238
01:02:17,089 --> 01:02:18,238
Quiet back there!

1239
01:02:18,238 --> 01:02:18,649
 

1240
01:02:18,649 --> 01:02:22,244
Who is going to sacrifice his life?
- We draw lots.

1241
01:02:22,244 --> 01:02:22,649
 

1242
01:02:22,649 --> 01:02:24,560
Wait. I got it.

1243
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:31,409
 

1244
01:02:31,409 --> 01:02:35,118
I did it wrong. Wait.
I start here.

1245
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:40,049
 

1246
01:02:40,049 --> 01:02:41,482
That's no good too.

1247
01:02:41,482 --> 01:02:41,889
 

1248
01:02:41,889 --> 01:02:44,244
I got it right.

1249
01:02:44,244 --> 01:02:44,929
 

1250
01:02:44,929 --> 01:02:47,238
A brave man!
Break through the lines.

1251
01:02:47,238 --> 01:02:47,649
 

1252
01:02:47,649 --> 01:02:50,322
While you're risking life and limb,

1253
01:02:50,322 --> 01:02:50,729
 

1254
01:02:50,729 --> 01:02:52,560
we'll be thinking, "What a sucker!"

1255
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,009
 

1256
01:02:53,009 --> 01:02:55,398
Goodbye...

1257
01:02:55,398 --> 01:02:55,809
 

1258
01:02:55,809 --> 01:02:58,767
Hail Freedonia!
- Hail Freedonia!

1259
01:02:58,767 --> 01:03:03,809
 

1260
01:03:03,809 --> 01:03:05,845
Where did they get you?

1261
01:03:05,845 --> 01:03:07,009
 

1262
01:03:07,009 --> 01:03:10,797
Careful! It's the only water we got.
- It's the only woman we got.

1263
01:03:10,797 --> 01:03:17,609
 

1264
01:03:17,609 --> 01:03:20,123
We're surrounded. They're attacking
from the rear. - This way.

1265
01:03:20,123 --> 01:03:20,529
 

1266
01:03:20,529 --> 01:03:22,121
We'll barricade the door!

1267
01:03:22,121 --> 01:03:31,449
 

1268
01:03:31,449 --> 01:03:35,328
This is Firefly. Send us help
at once. - Help is on the way.

1269
01:03:35,328 --> 01:03:35,729
 

1270
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:37,640
Help is on the way!

1271
01:03:37,640 --> 01:04:01,369
 

1272
01:04:01,369 --> 01:04:04,759
They got me... Water!

1273
01:04:04,759 --> 01:04:09,729
 

1274
01:04:09,729 --> 01:04:10,844
Water!

1275
01:04:10,844 --> 01:04:16,289
 

1276
01:04:16,289 --> 01:04:18,041
Get me outta here!

1277
01:04:18,041 --> 01:04:20,729
 

1278
01:04:20,729 --> 01:04:23,197
Last time this happened,
I was crawling under a bed.

1279
01:04:23,197 --> 01:04:23,609
 

1280
01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:25,008
If help would only come!

1281
01:04:25,008 --> 01:04:38,609
 

1282
01:04:38,609 --> 01:04:40,042
Any mail for me?

1283
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:43,409
 

1284
01:04:43,409 --> 01:04:44,808
Keep away from me!

1285
01:04:44,808 --> 01:04:57,249
 

1286
01:04:57,249 --> 01:04:59,683
Trentino! ...That's game.

1287
01:04:59,683 --> 01:05:04,929
 

1288
01:05:04,929 --> 01:05:06,487
Call me an "upstart"!

1289
01:05:06,487 --> 01:05:06,889
 

1290
01:05:06,889 --> 01:05:08,845
I surrender!

1291
01:05:08,845 --> 01:05:09,249
 

1292
01:05:09,249 --> 01:05:11,046
You'll have to wait
until the food runs out.

1293
01:05:11,046 --> 01:05:11,569
 

1294
01:05:11,569 --> 01:05:13,002
Victory is ours!

1295
01:05:13,002 --> 01:05:13,409
 

1296
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:17,163
Hail, hail Freedonia...

1297
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:17,569
 

1298
01:05:17,569 --> 01:05:20,766
Land of the...
