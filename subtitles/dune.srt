and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

2
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:53,094
A beginning is
a very delicate time.

3
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,766
Know then, that
it is the year 10191.

4
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,394
The Known Universe is

5
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:04,605
ruled by the
Padisha Emperor Shaddam IV,

6
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:06,983
my father.

7
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:11,571
In this time, the most
precious substance
in the Universe

8
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,656
is the spice melange.

9
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,993
The spice extends life.

10
00:01:18,454 --> 00:01:21,873
The spice expands
consciousness.

11
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:26,461
The spice is vital
to space travel.

12
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,672
The Spacing Guild
and its navigators,

13
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:33,968
who the spice has
mutated over 4,000 years,

14
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,763
use the orange spice gas,

15
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,349
which gives them
the ability to fold space.

16
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:42,643
That is,

17
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:47,190
travel to any part of
the Universe without moving.

18
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:51,319
Oh, yes.
I forgot to tell you.

19
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,155
The spice exists

20
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,700
on only one planet
in the entire Universe.

21
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:02,371
A desolate, dry planet
with vast deserts.

22
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:06,292
Hidden away within the rocks
of these deserts

23
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,878
are a people
known as the Fremen,

24
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:12,632
who have long held
a prophecy,

25
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,550
that a man would come,

26
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:19,555
a messiah, who would
lead them to true freedom.

27
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:24,393
The planet is Arrakis.

28
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,314
Also known as Dune.

<i>MAN:
A secret report

30
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:02,074
<i>Four planets have
come to our attention</i>

31
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,745
<i>regarding a plot which could
jeopardize spice production.</i>

32
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,874
<i>Planet Arrakis,
source of the Spice.</i>

33
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:14,045
<i>Planet Caladan,
home of House Atreides.</i>

37
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:29,268
<i>Send a third-stage
Guild Navigator to Kaitain</i>

38
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:32,271
<i>to demand details

39
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,191
<i>The spice must flow.</i>

40
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:22,863
Father?

41
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,865
Irulan, you must leave.

42
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,099
A third-stage Guild Navigator
will be here within minutes.

43
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,643
We felt his presence.

44
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,229
I shall want telepathy
during his visit

45
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,314
and a report
when we're finished.

46
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,192
I am your Truthsayer,
my lord.

47
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,778
He's here, my lord.

48
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,851
<i>TRANSLATING DEVICE:

49
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:36,479
Leave us.

50
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,815
Yes, my lord.

51
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:52,995
We are alone.

52
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:41,210
<i>We have just
folded space from Ix.</i>

53
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,711
Yes?

54
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,173
How was your journey?

55
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:48,592
<i>Many machines on Ix.</i>

56
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,720

Yes.

59
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:58,018
<i>Better than those
on Richese.</i>

60
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,481
<i>You are transparent.</i>

61
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,776
<i>I see many things.</i>

62
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:10,239
<i>I see plans within plans.</i>

63
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:13,909
<i>I see two great houses,</i>

64
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:18,998
<i>House Atreides,
House Harkonnen feuding.</i>

65
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,835
<i>I see you behind it.</i>

66
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,170
Yes.

67
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:27,423
<i>You must share with us.</i>

68
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,594
The Atreides House is
building a secret army

69
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,512
using a technique
unknown to us.

70
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:35,973
A technique
involving sound.

71
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,351
The Duke is becoming
more popular in the Landsraad.

72
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,395
He could threaten me.

73
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:43,105
I have ordered
House Atreides

74
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,524
to occupy Arrakis
to mine the spice,

75
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:48,777
thus replacing their enemies,
the Harkonnens.

76
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,362
House Atreides
will not refuse

77
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:53,407
because of the
tremendous power
they think they will gain.

78
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,159
Then, at an appointed time,

79
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:58,287
Baron Harkonnen
will return to Arrakis

80
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,040
and launch a sneak attack
on House Atreides.

81
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,708
I have promised the baron

82
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,961
five legions of
my Sardaukar terror troops.

83
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:10,633
<i>So the Harkonnens will
rid you of House Atreides.</i>

84
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,301
Yes.

91
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:35,991
<i>I mean Paul Atreides.</i>

<i>We want him killed.</i>

00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:43,249
<i>I did not say this.</i>

94

<i>I am not here.</i>

95
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,003
I understand.

96
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:22,204
<i>EMPEROR:
Why would they want
the Duke's son killed?</i>

97
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:29,545
We must have
a look at Paul Atreides.

98
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,714
On Caladan.

99

Not in the mood?

145

Mood's a thing for

Not fighting!

147

<i>You did seem finally

158
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,455
Would you really
have drawn my blood?

159
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,208
If you'd have fought
one whit below your abilities,

160
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:39,211
I'd have given you
a good scar to remind you.

161
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:45,133
Things have been
so serious here lately.

162
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,469
Soon we'll leave for Arrakis.

163
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:49,972
Arrakis is real.

164
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,475
The Harkonnens are real.

165
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,520
Doctor Yueh.

166
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:59,982
Do you have any information
on the worms of Arrakis?

167
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,777
I've obtained a filmbook
of a small specimen.

168
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,655
Only 125 meters long.

169
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:08,949
Only?

170
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,076
There have been documented
sightings of worms

171
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,330
as large as 450 meters
in the deep desert.

172
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,334
That's far from where
we'll be in Arrakeen.

173
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,629
The desert belt
and the south polar region

174
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,506
are marked forbidden.

175
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,758
How do the Fremen
survive there?

176
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,969
We don't know much
about the Fremen.

177
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:32,264
They live in the deep desert,
some of them in the cities.

178
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,600
They have
blue-within-blue eyes.

179
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:36,310
The eyes.

180
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,228
Yes.

181
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,607
Saturation of the blood
by the spice melange.

182
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,484
Could the spice
affect us in other ways?

183
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,820
Many dangers
exist on Arrakis.

184
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:47,904
For one,

185
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,906
the Harkonnens would not have

186
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:53,577
given up their CHOAM Company
contract so easily.

187
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,748
The Harkonnens are
our enemies, yes.

188
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,710
But behind them,
l suspect, is the Emperor.

189
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,297
You'll make
a formidable duke.

190
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:11,928
Now, remember,

191
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:15,849
the first step
in avoiding a trap

192
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:18,310
is knowing
of its existence.

193
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,521
I know,
but if it is a trap

194
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:22,814
then why are we going?

195
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,900
We have our new army.

196
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,902
Doctor Yueh,

197
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,780
put the weirding module
on him.

198
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,744
Well.

199
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,597
Clear and lock the room!

200
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,974
<i>GUARD:
Detachment, stand down.</i>

201
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,443
Activate a fighter.

202
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:30,424
Make the range two meters.

203
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,473
Precise control.

204
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,629
Duncan!

205
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:55,550
Paul, I was just on my way
to say goodbye to you.

206
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,845
I have to go on ahead,
alone,

207
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,388
l won't be seeing you
for a while.

208
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,766
l wish you were
coming with us. Why?

209
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,559
It's something
for your father.

210
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,645
He wants to talk to you.

211
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:09,731
I'll see you on Arrakis.

212
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,360
May the hand of God
be with you.

213
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:16,321
May the hand of God
be with us all, Duncan.

214
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,588
Father.

215
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:36,049
Thank you
for joining me, Paul.

216
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:40,136
Thufir Hawat has served
House Atreides
three generations.

217
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:45,141
He swears you are
the finest student
he has ever taught.

218
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,521
Yueh, Gurney, and Duncan
say the same.

219
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:53,900
Makes me feel very proud.

220
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:56,236
I want you
to be proud of me.

221
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,125
I'll miss the sea.

222
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,255
But a person
needs new experiences.

223
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:18,800
They jar something
deep inside

224
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:21,845
allowing him to grow.

225
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,557
Without change,

226
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:30,228
something sleeps
inside us,

227
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,482
and seldom awakens.

228
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,281
The sleeper must awaken.

229
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:09,935
Arrakis, Dune.

230
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,063
<i>Desert Planet.</i>

231
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,526
<i>FEYD:
I will kill you.</i>

232
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:22,739
<i>PAUL:
The second moon.</i>

233
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,041
Tell me of your
home world, Usul.

234
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,847
<i>JESSICA:
I know she has
come to test him.</i>

235
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:51,726
<i>No man has ever been
tested with the box.</i>

236
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,689
<i>Tonight, l may lose my son.</i>

237
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:24,259
Jessica, you were told
to bear only daughters
to the Atreides.

238
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,802
Jessica!

239
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,887
It meant so much to him.

240
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:31,599
You thought only of
a Duke's desire for a son?

241
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,477
Desires don't come
into this.

242
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:36,187
An Atreides daughter

243
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,273
could have been wed
to a Harkonnen heir

244
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,358
and sealed the breach.

245
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,903
We may lose
both bloodlines now.

246
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:48,450
l vowed never to
regret my decision.

247
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,121
I'll pay for
all my own mistakes.

248
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,957
And your son
will pay with you.

249
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:00,086
Arrakis, Dune,

250
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,131
Desert Planet.

251
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,258
Moving.

252
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:07,969
Moving.

253
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,826
REVEREND MOTHER:
We'll salvage what we can.

254
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,954
But l can tell you,
dear God,

255
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:38,291
for the father, nothing.

256
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:40,502
<i>For the father, nothing?</i>

257
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:44,214
Did you really think you could
bear the Kwisatz Haderach?

258
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:46,716
The Universe's super being?

259
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:49,511
How dare you!

260
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:52,472
My greatest student.

261
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,518
And my greatest
disappointment.

262
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:02,565
He's awake.
He's listening to us.

263
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,694
Good! Ready yourself,
young Paul Atreides.

264
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,613
I want to see you
in your mother's chambers

265
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,365
in one-quarter
of an hour.

266
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:14,786
Paul.

267
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,081
This is very important.

268
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,672
<i>PAUL:
Kwisatz Haderach?
The super being?</i>

269
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,883
<i>For the father, nothing?</i>

270
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:44,357
Vas.

271
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:03,168
This is the Reverend Mother
Gaius Helen Mohiam.

272
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:07,088
She's going
to observe you.

273
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:11,843
Please.

274
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,219
Jessica,

275
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,055
you know it must be done.

276
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,849
Your Reverence.

277
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,393
<i>PAUL:
What does she fear?</i>

278
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:22,687
What about my father?

279
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:23,855
Paul,

280
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:28,776
listen to the Reverend Mother
and do what she tells you.

281
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:39,787
Now, you,

282
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:42,999
come here.

283
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:46,294
<i>PAUL:
She's using the Voice.</i>

284
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:48,046
No.

285
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,131
<i>REVEREND MOTHER:
Some strength there.</i>

286
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:51,966
<i>Surprising.</i>

287
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,178
Come here!

288
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,513
<i>Here.</i>

289
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,975
<i>Come here.</i>

290
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:15,365
Do you see this?

291
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,411
Put your right hand
in the box.

292
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,872
What's in the box?

293
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:24,123
Pain.

294
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:25,416
Stop.

295
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:29,045
Put your hand in the box.

296
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:37,345
I hold at your neck
the gom jabbar.

297
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,765
This one kills
only animals.

298
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,227
Are you suggesting
the Duke's son is an animal?

299
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:47,855
Let us say, I suggest
you may be human.

300
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:52,110
Your awareness may
be powerful enough
to control your instincts.

301
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:53,987
Your instinct will be

302
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:56,447
to remove your hand
from the box.

303
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:58,533
If you do so,

304
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:01,202
you die.

305
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:06,124
You will feel

306
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,794
an itching

307
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:13,715
there.

308
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:19,512
Now, the itching
becomes burning.

309
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:24,142
Heat upon heat upon heat.

310
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:25,310
It burns.

311
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,145
Silence! Silence!

312
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:30,565
<i>PAUL:
I must not fear.
Fear is the mind killer.</i>

313
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:34,277
<i>Fear is the little death that
brings total obliteration.</i>

314
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:37,196
<i>I will face my fear.
I will permit it to pass</i>

<i>over me and through me.
I must not fear.</i>

316
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,826
You feel
the flesh crisping.

317
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,286
<i>Fear is the mind killer.</i>

319
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,832
<i>I will face my fear.</i>

320
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,501
Flesh dropping off.

00:27:57,426 --> 00:28:01,346
<i>Fear is the little death.
I'm...</i>

324
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:03,473
The pain!

325
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:05,391
No! Enough!

326
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:10,271
<i>Kull wahad!</i>

327
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,108
No woman child
ever withstood that much.

328
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:22,241
Take your hand out of the box
and look at it, young human.

329
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,037
Do it!

330
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,420
Pain by nerve induction.

331
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:36,381
A human can resist any pain.

332
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:39,759
Our test is
crisis and observation.

333
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,552
I see the truth of it.

334
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:43,513
<i>REVEREND MOTHER:
Could he be the one?</i>

335
00:28:44,098 --> 00:28:45,348
<i>Maybe.</i>

336
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,476
<i>But will he be ours
to control?</i>

337
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,897
Tell me of your
home world, Usul.

338
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:59,821
Do you know of
the Water of Life?

339
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,408
The bile from
the newborn worms
of Arrakis?

340
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:04,492
I have heard of it.

341
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,411
It is very dangerous.

342
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:09,914
The Bene Gesserit sisterhood
use it to see within.

343
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,209
There is a place

344
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,504
terrifying to us,

345
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:18,297
to women.

346
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,633
It is said

347
00:29:21,844 --> 00:29:23,719
a man will come.

348
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:26,681
The Kwisatz Haderach.

349
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,059
He will go
where we cannot.

350
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:34,522
Many men have tried.

351
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:37,233
They tried and failed?

352
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,569
They tried and died.

353
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:41,863
Jessica.

354
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:49,912
<i>JESSICA:
My son lives!</i>

355
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:58,629
I sense your
teachings in him.

356
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:02,091
Ignore the regular order
of training.

357
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:04,427
His safety
requires the Voice.

358
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,721
I've heard enough
of my safety.

359
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,639
What about my father?

360
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,266
I heard your talking.

361
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,560
You speak as if he were dead.
Well, he's not!

362
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:13,978
Paul.
Well, he's not.

363
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,647
And he won't die.
Tell me he won't die.

364
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,483
What can be done
has been done.

365
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,234
Mother, tell me!

366
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:47,887
<i>MESSENGER ON SPEAKER:

<i>Message for

<i>The Baron is
impatient for Leto's reply.</i>

369
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,356
It is by will alone
I set my mind in motion.

370
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,025
It is by the juice of Sapho
that thoughts acquire speed,

371
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,528
that lips acquire stains,
that stains become a warning.

372
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:06,489
It is by will alone
I set my mind in motion.

00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:25,234
Piter!

379
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:29,530
The Atreides will be
leaving Caladan soon, Baron,

380
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:32,575
and I have here
your answer from Duke Leto.

381
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:35,119
What does Leto say, Piter?

382
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:38,039
He wishes to inform you
that vendetta,

383
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:40,958
as he puts it,
using the ancient tongue,

384
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:43,836
the art of kanly,
is still alive.

385
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:47,423
He does not wish
to meet or speak with you.

386
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,385
I've made my peace gesture.

387
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:55,097
The forms of kanly
have been obeyed.

388
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,893
Bring in Feyd and Rabban.

389
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:27,755
As you
instructed me,

390
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,049
I have enlightened
your nephews

391
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,384
concerning my plan...

392
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:32,760
My plan.

393
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:38,182
The plan to
crush the Atreides.

394
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,726
Feyd,

395
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:43,771
Rabban,

396
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:46,232
go quietly.

397
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,903
No other great house
of the Landsraad

398
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:54,865
must ever know
of the Emperor's aid
to the Baron.

399
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:59,870
The entire Landsraad
would turn against the Baron

400
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,665
and the Emperor.

401
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,042
Put the pick in there,
Pete,

402
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:09,130
and turn it round
real neat.

403
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,778
You are so beautiful,
my Baron.

404
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:36,991
Your skin, love to me.

405

Your diseases
lovingly cared for,

406
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,873
for all eternity.

407
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,215
BARON:
I will have Arrakis
back for myself!

408
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,761
He who controls the spice,
controls the Universe!

409
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:59,180
And what Piter
did not tell you

410
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:02,558
is we have control of
someone who is very close,

411
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:05,311
very close to Duke Leto.

412
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:08,522
This person, this traitor

413
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:12,359
will be worth more to us
than 10 legions of Sardaukar.

414
00:35:12,486 --> 00:35:14,403
And who is this traitor?

415
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:17,823
I won't tell you
who the traitor is,

416
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:19,742
or when we'll attack.

417
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:21,702
However,

418
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:25,581
the Duke will die before
these eyes and he'll know...

419
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:28,083
He'll know that it is l,

420
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:32,129
Baron Vladimir Harkonnen,
who encompasses his doom!

421
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:52,751
<i>BARON:

to the Duke and his family.</i>

00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:34,543
Oh, I'll miss

<i>PAUL:

00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:27,442
the prophecy.

429
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:31,238
One will come.

430
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:35,534
The voice from
the outer world.

431
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:38,579
Bringing the Holy War,

432
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:40,831
the Jihad,

433
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,917
which will
cleanse the Universe,

434
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:47,921

Tell me.

444
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:56,281
Why haven't
we heard from you?

445
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:57,658
My lord,

446
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,576
I suspect so much.

447
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:03,705
I think they are
the allies we seek.

448
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,582
They are strong, fierce.

449
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:08,502
They do not give their
loyalty easily or quickly.

450
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:11,338
As you know,
the Imperium has never

451
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,548
been able to take
a census of the Fremen.

My lord,

455
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:23,642
I suspect an incredible secret
has been kept on this planet.

00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:27,437
That the Fremen exist
in vast numbers.

457
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:29,773
Vast.

458
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,361
And it is they
who control Arrakis.

00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:24,388
DUKE LETO:
We are in your hands, Doctor.

483
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:27,182
Your gift of the stillsuits
is much appreciated.

484
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:30,102
Will you give us
an explanation of
their workings?

485
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,688
Well, this is a still suit
of Fremen manufacture,

486
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:35,607
the most efficient type
on Arrakis.

487
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:36,733
Basically...

488
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,406
DUKE LETO:
It's all right, Gurney.

489
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:45,200
GURNEY:
Yes, Sire.

490
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:47,661
Basically,

491
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,788
it's a high-efficiency
filter,

492
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:51,623
and heat exchange system.

493
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,876
Perspiration passes
through the first layer

494
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,671
and is gathered
in the second.

495
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,673
The salt is separated.

496
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:03,343
Breathing and walking
provide the pumping action.

497
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:07,556
The reclaimed water
circulates to catch pockets

498
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:08,890
from which you can drink

499
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:12,227
through this tube
around your neck.

500
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:16,398
Urine and feces are processed
in the thigh pads.

501
00:46:17,066 --> 00:46:19,734
Should you be
in the open desert,

502
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,821
remember to breathe in
through your mouth

503
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:25,490
and out through
this nose tube.

504
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:28,201
With a Fremen suit
in good working condition,

505
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:30,620
life can be sustained
for weeks,

506
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:33,415
even in the deep desert,
Sire.

507
00:46:35,168 --> 00:46:36,543
My thanks.

508
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,045
With your permission.

509
00:46:41,174 --> 00:46:43,425
You've worn
a stillsuit before.

510
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:44,801
No.

511
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:47,554
Your suit is
fitted desert fashion.

512
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,264
Who told you
how to do that?

513
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:51,057
No one.

514
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:53,727
It seemed
the proper way.

515
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,315
That it is.

516
00:46:58,399 --> 00:47:01,860
<i>DOCTOR KYNES:
He shall know your ways
as if born to them.</i>

517
00:47:03,863 --> 00:47:05,906
We're wasting time, Sire.

518
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:24,591
That language?
Translate it.

519
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,596
Very faint.

520
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:36,102
Harkonnen!

521
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,361
<i>AIR CONTROLLER:
Air speed, zero-five.</i>

522
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:48,615
<i>Ambient temperature,

523
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,368

524

<i>...35% percent

525
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:06,049
That's where I told
your sandmaster

526
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,717
to concentrate
the harvesting today.

527
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:11,137
Southeast,
over the Shield Wall.

528
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:16,935
<i>AIR CONTROLLER:

<i>Air speed, one-three-zero.</i>

530
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:25,777
<i>Caution. You've now cleared
protective Shield Wall</i>

531
00:48:25,987 --> 00:48:28,405
<i>and entered open desert.</i>

532
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:38,957
Will we see a worm?

533
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,669
Where there is spice
and spice mining,
there are always worms.

534
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:43,962
Always?

535
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,171
Always.

536
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,507
Why do they come?

537
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,552
To protect their territory.

538
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:53,096
Vibrations attract them.

539
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:55,849
<i>PAUL:
He must be a Fremen
or in with them.</i>

540
00:48:56,517 --> 00:48:58,351
<i>He's studying us.</i>

541
00:48:58,728 --> 00:49:00,979
<i>He's hiding something
about the spice.</i>

542
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:04,357
Is there a relationship
between the worms
and the spice?

543
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:10,530
As I said, they defend
the spice sands.

544
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:14,743
As to their relationship
with the spice,

545
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,370
who knows?

546
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,930
<i>DOCTOR YUEH:
My message, it's here.</i>

547
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:42,020
There are more
enemy bodies coming in

548
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:44,564
for your inspection,
Doctor Yueh.

549
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:50,737
Are you all right?

550
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,530
Yes, I'm fine.

551
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,658
Thank you, Thufir.

552
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:00,372
Dust cloud ahead, Sire.

553
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:02,290
That's it. Spice mining.

554
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,585
No other cloud
quite like it.

555
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,590
Wormsign?

556
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,133
<i>Is it wormsign?</i>

557
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:14,594
<i>DOCTOR KYNES:
Yes. Worm. Big one.</i>

558
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:17,764
You've got sharp eyes.
May l?

559
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,978
Calling Harvester Pad Nine.
Wormsign.

560
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:25,939
<i>MAN ON RADIO:
Who calls Pad Nine?</i>

561
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,148
Don't mention the Duke.

562
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:29,359
This is an un-coded channel.

563
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:31,861
Unlisted flight
northeast of you.

564
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:33,905
Wormsign on intercept course.

565
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:36,908
Estimated contact,
15 minutes.

566
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,619
<i>MAN ON RADIO:

<i>Contact in 16 minutes minus.</i>

568
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:44,124
<i>Very precise estimate.</i>

569
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:45,834
<i>Who's on that
unlisted flight?</i>

570
00:50:48,129 --> 00:50:49,921
What happens now?

571
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:51,047
The carryall will come

572
00:50:51,132 --> 00:50:53,466
and lift off
the spice harvester.

573
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:56,636
Try to get in close
over the harvester.

574
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:59,180
You'll find this
interesting, Sire.

575
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,391
They work until
the very last minute.

576
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:04,436
Spotter control, there's
no sign of the carryall.

577
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:06,146
It isn't answering.

578
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:09,232
The worm is
eight minutes away, Sire.

579
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,818
<i>MINER 1:

00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:13,069
<i>Report One.</i>

581
00:51:13,154 --> 00:51:14,154
<i>MINER 2:

582
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:15,405
<i>Report two.</i>

00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:16,698
<i>MINER 3:

<i>Report Three.</i>

585
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:18,867
<i>MINER 4:

586
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:19,909
<i>Report four.</i>

00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:22,245
<i>MINER 5:

Repeat, no contact.</i>

588
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,205
I think they've
got our carryall.

589
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:26,624
Damn it! Harkonnens.

590
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:29,252
We're coming down to
take you off the harvester.

591
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:31,296
All spotters are
ordered to comply.

592
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:32,672
Ordered by whom?

593
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:34,215
Duke Leto Atreides.

594
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,426
<i>MINER 1:
Yes. Yes, Sire.</i>

595
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,761
How many men do you have?

596
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:39,429
<i>Full crew, 26 men.</i>

597
00:51:39,889 --> 00:51:42,015
But, Sire, we can't
leave all this spice.

598
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,433
Damn the spice!

599
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:44,809
Get out of there!

600
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,446
Two men in
each of the spotters!

601
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,114
You, over here!

602
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:01,034
Run! Run!

603
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,793
I can't see him yet,
but he is very close now.

604
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:13,129
Damn sloppy.
Really damn sloppy.

605
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:15,089
Come on, boys.
Come on.

606
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,887
We're going to
be heavy, Sire.

607
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:22,972
<i>PAUL:

Bless the coming

May His passing
cleanse the world.

613
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,086
What's that
you're saying?

614
00:52:53,212 --> 00:52:54,462
Nothing.

615
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,917
Gods, what a monster.

616
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:44,929
Someone is going to
pay for this, I promise.

617
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:51,102
<i>DOCTOR KYNES:
He's more concerned over

<i>I must admit,
against all better judgment,</i>

619

<i>I like this Duke.</i>

My lady,

the maids and servants,

Hawat has cleared them.

Excuse me, my lady.

624
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:02,966
The Harkonnens may have
tampered with them medically.

625
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,310
When you said
Harkonnens,

626
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:19,065
I didn't know you had
so much reason to hate them.

627
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,237
Well, my wife...

628
00:55:26,198 --> 00:55:29,283
But, of course, you...
You didn't know my wife.

00:56:53,786 --> 00:56:55,912
<i>What is it doing to me?</i>

642
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:09,509
<i>Second moon.</i>

643
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:13,846
<i>DUKE LETO:
The sleeper must awaken.</i>

644
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:16,015
<i>PAUL:
Am I the one?</i>

645
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:31,864
<i>A hunter-seeker!</i>

646
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:34,325
<i>It can't get me
if I don't move.</i>

647
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:37,745
<i>It's too dark in here
for it to see clearly.</i>

648
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:56,472
<i>I've got
to try to grab it.</i>

649
00:57:57,015 --> 00:58:00,101
<i>The suspensor field
will make it
slippery on the bottom.</i>

650
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:02,228
<i>I must grip it tightly.</i>

651
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,566
<i>Who is operating
that thing?</i>

652
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:09,569
<i>It has to be someone
in the palace.</i>

653
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:11,821
<i>I could shout for help,</i>

654
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:14,073
<i>but it would kill whoever
opened the door.</i>

655
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,302
<i>Hold still.</i>

656
00:58:58,619 --> 00:59:00,494
It would have killed me.

657
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:05,041
I was its target.
It went to the motion.

658
00:59:05,918 --> 00:59:07,418
Who are you?

659
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:09,587
I am the Shadout Mapes,

660
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,215
the housekeeper.

661
00:59:12,758 --> 00:59:16,135
I must cleanse
the way between us.

662
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:20,973
You saved my life,
and we Fremen
pay our debts.

663
00:59:21,141 --> 00:59:22,600
<i>A Fremen.</i>

664
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,727
It is known to us

665
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:27,146
that you've a traitor
in your midst.

666
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:29,523
Who it is,
we cannot say.

667
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:32,235
But we are certain
of it.

668
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:43,829
A traitor.

669
00:59:55,175 --> 00:59:58,219
Set up a sonar probe
immediately.

670
01:00:06,687 --> 01:00:08,354
ATREIDES TROOPSMAN:
Harkonnen.

671
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:14,568
<i>They've tried to take
the life of my son.</i>

672
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:21,909
Sector 6 through 80
progress reports, Sire.

673
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:23,703
Take it, Thufir.

674
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:29,792
Sector 680, copy the 6th,
the summit, the 8th,
quadrant over,

675
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:32,962
the 9th plus 84 circles, weave
the 80 and call the 4th. Copy.

676
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:42,179
8. Thufir Hawat, Mentat,
Master of assassins.

677
01:00:45,934 --> 01:00:47,935
Uh, the palace
is now secure.

678
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:52,106
The city of Arrakeen
is under martial law.

679
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:56,610
We have troops here
headquartered underground

680
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:59,238
on sub-floors
6 through 10.

681
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:01,782
The rest of the troops
are stationed in Arrakeen,

682
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:04,035
and we have some
on the airfield.

683
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:07,705
Our new army is still
in training, but everything,

684
01:01:07,873 --> 01:01:09,415
everything is shielded.

685
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:12,626
And with this shielding
we are impenetrable.

686
01:02:05,931 --> 01:02:08,224
Sleep well, my son.

687
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:21,570
Um, Father,

688
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:24,782
drugged.

689
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:34,125
<i>DUKE LETO:
Jessica, what is wrong?</i>

690
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:36,961
<i>Forgive me,
my beloved concubine.</i>

691
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:39,630
<i>I should have married you.</i>

692
01:02:40,674 --> 01:02:43,092
<i>Why hold a dream
to ascend to the throne</i>

693
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:45,136
<i>through
a political marriage?</i>

694
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,140
<i>I should have married you.</i>

695
01:03:13,832 --> 01:03:15,374
What happened?

696
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:39,023
Yueh!

697
01:03:39,107 --> 01:03:41,066
<i>He sabotaged
the house generators.</i>

698
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:42,943
<i>We are wide open!</i>

699
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:49,658
<i>MAN ON PA SYSTEM:
House shield deactivating.</i>

700
01:03:50,118 --> 01:03:53,204
I've destroyed the new army's
weirding modules.

701
01:03:53,497 --> 01:03:55,664
I've brought
House Atreides down.

702
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:56,999
Why?

703
01:03:57,083 --> 01:04:00,920
I wish to kill a man.
Not you, my dear Duke.

704
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:03,380
You were already dead.

705
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:06,091
But you'll get close
to the Baron before you die.

706
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:09,803
You'll be tied and drugged,
but you can still attack.

707
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:12,264
You can still attack!

708
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:15,226
When you see the Baron,

709
01:04:15,602 --> 01:04:18,270
you'll have a new
poison gas tooth.

710
01:04:19,773 --> 01:04:22,942
He'll want you close,
so he can gloat over you.

711
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:28,447
One bite on this tooth
and a strong exhale...

712
01:04:29,741 --> 01:04:30,741
Refuse.

713
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:31,992
No! You mustn't!

714
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,495
Because, in return,

715
01:04:34,663 --> 01:04:37,998
I'll save the lives
of your Paul and Jessica.

716
01:04:43,046 --> 01:04:44,505
For Paul.

717
01:04:49,094 --> 01:04:50,094
Ahhh!

718
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:02,815
When you see the Baron,
remember the tooth.

719
01:05:03,483 --> 01:05:06,527
The tooth! The tooth!

720
01:05:07,821 --> 01:05:11,282
The shield is down!
The shield is down!

721
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:15,077
Open the doors!

722
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:17,288
Signals!

723
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:21,000
Get that shield up!

724
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:24,086
The shield! The shield!

725
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:50,863
<i>THUFIR:
The weirding modules!
Destroyed!</i>

726
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:42,498
Long live Duke Leto!

727
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:07,564
The drug was timed.

728
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:13,278
Dr. Yueh has been
very valuable to us.

729
01:07:15,907 --> 01:07:18,992
What a pity
you must remain gagged.

730
01:07:20,245 --> 01:07:22,454
We can't let
ourselves be swayed

731
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,790
by your witch's voice,
now, can we?

732
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:28,377
<i>Leto, where are you?</i>

733
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:32,756
<i>How simple to subdue us.</i>

734
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:47,980
Goodbye, Jessica.

735
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:50,983
And goodbye
to your sweet son.

736
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:54,737
I want to spit
once on your head.

737
01:07:55,447 --> 01:07:57,698
Just some spittle
in your face.

738
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:02,995
What a luxury!

739
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:11,170
We were ordered to kill them.
So kill them!

740
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:18,260
<i>I wish this was Paul.</i>

741
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:26,643
I knew Yueh's wife.

742
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:32,941
I was the one who broke
his Imperial conditioning.

743
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:40,324
I've thought of
many pleasures with you.

744
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:44,703
It is perhaps
better that you die

745
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:46,955
in the innards
of a worm.

746
01:08:58,051 --> 01:09:00,552
What are your orders,
Piter?

747
01:09:00,929 --> 01:09:04,056
Take them to the desert,
as the traitor suggested.

748
01:09:05,016 --> 01:09:07,059
The worms will
destroy the evidence.

749
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:09,895
Their bodies
must never be found.

750
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:25,828
They're down on this floor
somewhere.

751
01:09:25,912 --> 01:09:26,995
Down there.

752
01:09:46,766 --> 01:09:48,183
Duncan!

753
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:54,022
Get off!

754
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:00,904
You wish now
to join your wife?

755
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:02,948
Is that it, traitor?

756
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:05,534
She lives?

757
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:07,160
You wish to join her?

758
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:12,541
Join her, then.

759
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,093
You think
you've defeated me?

760
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:30,392
You think I don't know
what I've gained, for my wife!

761
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:38,817
Take him away.

762
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:02,841
<i>JESSICA:
Yueh's sign.</i>

763
01:11:06,429 --> 01:11:08,263
<i>He's left us stillsuits.</i>

764
01:11:17,023 --> 01:11:19,149
Don't touch my mother!

765
01:11:19,317 --> 01:11:21,068
<i>He's trying the Voice.</i>

766
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:23,278
<i>The Reverend Mother
said it could save him.</i>

767
01:11:23,363 --> 01:11:26,114
Did you hear a noise
from the little one, huh?

768
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:29,159
No, I didn't hear
anything.

769
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:34,206
The little one.

770
01:11:47,971 --> 01:11:49,388
Remove her gag.

771
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:51,139
Excellent!

772
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:10,784
There's no need
to fight over me.

773
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:22,963
<i>A poisoned blade.</i>

774
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:37,436
First cut my son's bonds.

775
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:46,611
That's it.

776
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:01,043
Oh, my God.

777
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:13,430
<i>It's under control.</i>

778
01:13:42,543 --> 01:13:46,046
Duke Leto Atreides.

779
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:52,636
Where is
the ducal signet ring?

780
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:56,515
I must have his ring.

781
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:00,268
The ring!

782
01:14:03,564 --> 01:14:06,817
He was brought to us
as is, my lord Baron.

783
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:11,404
You killed the doctor
too soon, you fool!

784
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:16,034
<i>DUKE LETO:
The doctor, Yueh,
what did he say?</i>

785
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:18,870
<i>Paul and Jessica safe.</i>

786
01:14:19,497 --> 01:14:21,581
Yes. The tooth!

787
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:23,875
He's coming around, Baron.

788
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:25,544
Where's your ring?

789
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:27,712
Huh?

790
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:30,090
You do not answer?

791
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:32,592
<i>Wait! Wait!</i>

792
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:35,428
<i>You must come closer.</i>

793
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:39,724
The water of my life

794
01:14:42,186 --> 01:14:43,395
for Paul.

795
01:14:43,855 --> 01:14:47,149
He's crying.
He's crying!

796
01:14:48,192 --> 01:14:50,110
What does that mean,
Piter?

797
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:55,574
<i>Come closer, Baron.</i>

798
01:15:01,539 --> 01:15:02,581
No!

799
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:05,584
<i>Jessica!</i>

800
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:08,879
Leto!

801
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:12,090
Leto, he's dead!

802
01:15:12,175 --> 01:15:14,092
No, he's dead!

803
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:16,469
I know.

804
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:25,937
Am I alive?

805
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:29,024
I'm alive?

806
01:15:29,108 --> 01:15:30,150
Yes,

807
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:33,445
you're alive,
my Baron.

808
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:36,031
I'm alive, eh?

809
01:15:36,616 --> 01:15:38,408
I'm alive!

810
01:15:38,492 --> 01:15:40,285
I'm alive!

811
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:42,037
I'm alive!

812
01:15:50,922 --> 01:15:53,131
PAUL:
I can't maintain any altitude.

813
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:56,009
We'll never reach
the safety of rock!

814
01:16:00,139 --> 01:16:02,015
Maybe that small rock.

815
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:04,309
Where are we,
do you think?

816
01:16:04,477 --> 01:16:06,228
The south polar regions.

817
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:10,148
The forbidden area.
Hold on.

818
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:20,492
Hurry!

819
01:16:23,329 --> 01:16:25,205
Take the stillsuits!

820
01:16:26,958 --> 01:16:28,250
PAUL:
Hurry!

821
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:30,293
This crash
might bring a worm.

822
01:16:35,549 --> 01:16:36,758
The signet.

823
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:39,719
A million deaths
are not enough for Yueh!

824
01:17:03,494 --> 01:17:05,203
<i>Where are my feelings?</i>

825
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:07,497
<i>I feel for no one.</i>

826
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:13,712
<i>The second moon.</i>

827
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:32,689
<i>GUILD NAVIGATOR:
I mean Paul Atreides.</i>

828
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:35,400
<i>We want him killed.</i>

829
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:37,402
<i>PAUL:
Why?</i>

830
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:39,904
<i>Why do they want me killed?</i>

831
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:42,866
<i>It has to be something
to do with the spice.</i>

832
01:17:43,743 --> 01:17:45,076
<i>But what?</i>

833
01:17:51,459 --> 01:17:55,170
<i>BARON:
He who controls the spice,
controls the Universe!</i>

834
01:18:03,054 --> 01:18:05,638
<i>PAUL:
This moon holds my future.</i>

835
01:18:18,903 --> 01:18:22,113
<i>Never one drop of rain
on Arrakis.</i>

836
01:18:25,785 --> 01:18:29,329
<i>DUKE LETO:
The sleeper must awaken.</i>

837
01:18:38,172 --> 01:18:40,048
<i>They will call me,</i>

838
01:18:40,466 --> 01:18:42,008
<i>Muad'Dib.</i>

839
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:52,560
Listen to me. Listen!

840
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:55,855
You wanted to know
about my dreams.

841
01:18:56,941 --> 01:18:59,359
Well, I've just had
a waking dream.

842
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:03,613
Do you know why?
The spice!

843
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:06,408
It's in everything here.

844
01:19:07,326 --> 01:19:08,576
Calm yourself.

845
01:19:08,661 --> 01:19:10,662
Like the Truthsayer drug.

846
01:19:12,456 --> 01:19:13,748
It's a poison.

847
01:19:14,834 --> 01:19:17,669
You knew the spice
would change me.

848
01:19:18,295 --> 01:19:19,838
But thanks
to your teachings,

849
01:19:19,922 --> 01:19:22,257
it's changing
my consciousness.

850
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:25,009
I see it!
I can see it!

851
01:19:25,928 --> 01:19:27,345
<i>Is he the one?</i>

852
01:19:28,973 --> 01:19:31,224
You carry my unborn sister
in your womb.

853
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:32,892
<i>He knows.</i>

854
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:45,530
Father!

855
01:19:49,869 --> 01:19:52,704
<i>Father, I promise,</i>

856
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:55,582
<i>one day
the sleeper will awaken.</i>

857
01:19:56,542 --> 01:19:58,960
<i>And I will avenge your death.</i>

858
01:19:59,712 --> 01:20:02,422
<i>I will not stop
until I destroy</i>

859
01:20:02,506 --> 01:20:04,674
<i>the Emperor and the Baron.</i>

860
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:11,431
Father.

861
01:20:27,281 --> 01:20:28,865
Go now.

862
01:20:31,118 --> 01:20:34,996
Take him
to his desert to die.

863
01:20:37,041 --> 01:20:38,416
Go.

864
01:21:09,823 --> 01:21:12,575
<i>PAUL:
Yueh's left the plan
for the weirding modules.</i>

865
01:21:24,255 --> 01:21:26,589
We have to get to
that mountain of rock.

866
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,509
We have entered
the time

867
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:32,220
when all will turn against us
and seek our lives.

868
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:50,154
It's further
than I thought.

869
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:53,324
A worm is sure to come.

870
01:21:55,828 --> 01:21:58,496
I'll plant this thumper.
That should divert it.

871
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:30,403
Remember,
walk without rhythm,

872
01:22:30,487 --> 01:22:31,946
and we won't
attract a worm.

873
01:22:32,448 --> 01:22:34,073
It will go
to the thumper.

874
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:37,910
I'm ready.

875
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:20,912
Faster!

876
01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:24,415
It's deafening!

877
01:24:38,991 --> 01:24:39,991
Ooh!

878
01:24:42,161 --> 01:24:43,786
<i>The spice!</i>

879
01:24:45,664 --> 01:24:47,165
Do you smell it?

880
01:24:47,332 --> 01:24:48,332
Yes!

881
01:24:55,758 --> 01:24:56,758
Paul!

882
01:25:25,662 --> 01:25:27,371
<i>A thumper.</i>

883
01:25:35,714 --> 01:25:38,216
<i>The worm! Spice!</i>

884
01:25:38,592 --> 01:25:40,009
<i>Is there a relationship?</i>

885
01:25:54,066 --> 01:25:57,235
What's happened?
Why did it leave?

886
01:25:58,570 --> 01:26:01,489
Someone started
another thumper.

887
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:05,868
We're not alone.

888
01:26:35,732 --> 01:26:37,525
Man-carved steps.

889
01:26:37,609 --> 01:26:38,943
Yes.

890
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,959
<i>JESSICA:
Such stealth.</i>

891
01:26:55,085 --> 01:26:56,711
<i>I didn't hear them.</i>

892
01:26:56,795 --> 01:27:00,214
STILGAR:
Perhaps these are the ones
the Shadout Mapes told us of.

893
01:27:00,299 --> 01:27:01,966
I will take the boy-man.

894
01:27:02,718 --> 01:27:05,094
He shall have sanctuary
in my tribe.

895
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:18,149
Get back!
She has the weirding way.

896
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:22,028
Great Gods!

897
01:27:22,779 --> 01:27:25,156
If you can do this
to the strongest of us,

898
01:27:25,991 --> 01:27:29,201
you're worth 10 times
your weight of water.

899
01:27:32,205 --> 01:27:34,999
As the leader of my people,
I give you my bond.

900
01:27:36,001 --> 01:27:38,502
Teach us
this weirding way,

901
01:27:38,962 --> 01:27:41,756
and you both
shall have sanctuary.

902
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:45,676
Your water shall
mingle with our water.

903
01:27:46,637 --> 01:27:48,638
Then I will teach you
our way of battle.

904
01:27:53,143 --> 01:27:56,479
I give you the word bond
of a Bene Gesserit.

905
01:27:57,022 --> 01:27:58,981
It is the legend.

906
01:28:04,571 --> 01:28:07,531
I am Chani,
daughter of Liet.

907
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:12,203
I would not have permitted you
to harm my tribe.

908
01:28:13,664 --> 01:28:15,164
<i>From my dreams.</i>

909
01:28:16,083 --> 01:28:18,125
<i>So beautiful.</i>

910
01:28:19,086 --> 01:28:20,211
Come with me.

911
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:22,380
I'll show you
an easier way down.

912
01:28:40,941 --> 01:28:43,067
You have strength.

913
01:28:43,652 --> 01:28:45,820
You shall be known as Usul,

914
01:28:45,988 --> 01:28:48,781
which is the strength
of the base of the pillar.

915
01:28:49,366 --> 01:28:51,742
This is your secret name
in our troop.

916
01:28:52,536 --> 01:28:55,538
But you must choose
the name of manhood,

917
01:28:55,622 --> 01:28:57,915
which we will
call you openly.

918
01:29:00,919 --> 01:29:03,838
What do you call
the mouse shadow
in the second moon?

919
01:29:06,967 --> 01:29:09,760
We call that one Muad'Dib.

920
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:13,556
Could I be known
as Paul Muad'Dib?

921
01:29:14,433 --> 01:29:16,600
You are Paul Muad'Dib.

922
01:29:18,103 --> 01:29:21,230
And your mother shall be
a Sayyadina among us.

923
01:29:22,107 --> 01:29:23,733
We welcome you.

924
01:29:24,985 --> 01:29:27,778
<i>The dream unfolds.</i>

925
01:29:48,842 --> 01:29:50,009
Moisture!

926
01:29:50,427 --> 01:29:51,594
Wind traps.

927
01:29:52,471 --> 01:29:53,971
Huge ones.

928
01:30:04,858 --> 01:30:09,528
<i>Water.
Millions of decaliters.</i>

929
01:30:10,072 --> 01:30:11,655
A treasure.

930
01:30:11,782 --> 01:30:14,116
Greater than treasure,
Usul.

931
01:30:14,826 --> 01:30:17,870
We have thousands
of such caches,

932
01:30:19,247 --> 01:30:22,124
and only a few of us
know them all.

933
01:30:22,751 --> 01:30:25,002
And when we have enough,

934
01:30:25,712 --> 01:30:29,006
we shall change
the face of Arrakis.

935
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:50,945
Tell me
of your home world, Usul.

I place you

It's yours to squeeze,

I want you to squeeze
and squeeze and squeeze!

945
01:32:04,269 --> 01:32:07,104
Give me spice!
Drive them!

946
01:32:07,189 --> 01:32:09,565
Drive them
into utter submission!

947
01:32:09,649 --> 01:32:12,443
Do not show
the slightest pity or mercy!

Never stop! Go! Go!

01:32:15,697 --> 01:32:16,864
Show no mercy!

965
01:34:01,219 --> 01:34:03,721
<i>But what
of my unborn child?</i>

966
01:34:05,307 --> 01:34:08,392
<i>One day,
I will have to do this.</i>

967
01:34:25,452 --> 01:34:27,494
<i>PRINCESS IRULAN:
Following the Bene Gesserit
tradition,</i>

968
01:34:27,579 --> 01:34:30,080
<i>the old Reverend Mother
surrendered her life</i>

969
01:34:30,248 --> 01:34:32,416
<i>as she surrendered
her knowledge.</i>

970
01:34:33,918 --> 01:34:38,088
<i>Jessica had successfully
transmuted the poisonous
Water of Life.</i>

971
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:42,176
<i>PAUL: Every man
who has tried has died.</i>

972
01:34:43,428 --> 01:34:45,220
<i>Am I the one?</i>

973
01:34:45,972 --> 01:34:48,766
<i>DUKE LETO:
The sleeper must awaken.</i>

974
01:34:52,771 --> 01:34:55,230
<i>PRINCESS IRULAN:
The tremendous power
of the Water of Life</i>

975
01:34:55,315 --> 01:34:59,360
<i>caused the premature birth
of Jessica's daughter, Alia.</i>

976
01:34:59,652 --> 01:35:01,570
<i>Alia was born
with all the knowledge</i>

977
01:35:01,654 --> 01:35:03,655
<i>and powers of
a Reverend Mother.</i>

978
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:22,633
BARON:
Feyd, even though
he's aging,

979
01:35:22,801 --> 01:35:26,136
Thufir is one of the finest
Mentats in the Universe.

980
01:35:27,055 --> 01:35:30,808
And he's mine, Feyd,
all mine.

981
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:35,479
Try it now.

982
01:35:35,563 --> 01:35:36,563
I will.

983
01:35:36,648 --> 01:35:37,648
Come.

984
01:35:51,496 --> 01:35:53,205
Oh, Thufir!

985
01:35:53,998 --> 01:35:56,834
I see they've installed
your heart plug already.

986
01:35:58,378 --> 01:36:00,796
Don't be angry.
Everyone gets one here.

987
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:03,757
But this is not
why we're here.

988
01:36:05,176 --> 01:36:07,803
We've brought you
a little cat, Thufir.

989
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:11,348
You must care for it
if you wish to live.

990
01:36:12,892 --> 01:36:16,854
A poison has been introduced
into your body, Thufir Hawat.

991
01:36:17,689 --> 01:36:21,275
By milking this, this smooth,
little cat body,

992
01:36:21,359 --> 01:36:23,360
you receive your antidote.

993
01:36:23,695 --> 01:36:25,696
It must be done
each day.

994
01:36:28,867 --> 01:36:33,787
All I can see
is an Atreides
that I want to kill.

995
01:36:34,581 --> 01:36:37,458
Feyd, no, no.

996
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:41,044
Thufir's a Harkonnen now.

997
01:36:42,046 --> 01:36:44,047
Aren't you, Thufir?

998
01:36:44,132 --> 01:36:48,010
<i>My Duke,
how I've failed you.</i>

999
01:37:06,237 --> 01:37:08,155
<i>Chani, I love you.</i>

1000
01:37:10,241 --> 01:37:11,742
<i>I've always loved you.</i>

1001
01:37:37,143 --> 01:37:39,436
<i>PAUL:
The Holy Warriors.</i>

1002
01:37:40,522 --> 01:37:42,981
<i>No one ever dreamed
there were so many.</i>

1003
01:37:44,609 --> 01:37:48,946
I am Usul. Paul Muad'Dib.

1004
01:37:52,867 --> 01:37:55,035
Our shared enemy,
the Harkonnens,

1005
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:57,829
are once again
in control of Arrakis,

1006
01:37:58,957 --> 01:38:01,124
Stilgar, your leader,

1007
01:38:01,459 --> 01:38:03,460
has asked me and my mother
to teach you

1008
01:38:03,545 --> 01:38:05,921
the weirding way
to crush the Harkonnens.

1009
01:38:07,674 --> 01:38:09,591
We must do more than this.

1010
01:38:10,468 --> 01:38:14,179
We must totally destroy
all spice production
on Arrakis.

1011
01:38:15,765 --> 01:38:19,351
The Guild and the entire
Universe depends on spice.

1012
01:38:20,812 --> 01:38:23,814
He who can destroy a thing,
controls a thing.

1013
01:38:25,149 --> 01:38:27,943
I will take 100 of your
warriors and train them.

1014
01:38:28,653 --> 01:38:31,321
This 100 will train
the thousands that remain.

1015
01:38:32,365 --> 01:38:34,825
When the spice flow stops,

1016
01:38:34,909 --> 01:38:37,536
all eyes
will turn to Arrakis.

1017
01:38:38,162 --> 01:38:40,122
The Baron
and the Emperor himself

1018
01:38:40,206 --> 01:38:42,040
will be forced
to deal with us.

1019
01:38:45,253 --> 01:38:49,715
Arrakis will become
the center of the Universe.

1020
01:38:52,093 --> 01:38:53,176
Orato!

1021
01:38:57,181 --> 01:39:00,726
This obelisk is of
your hardest stone.

1022
01:39:02,687 --> 01:39:03,687
Kick it.

1023
01:39:10,612 --> 01:39:11,612
Hit it.

1024
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:18,160
Yell at it.

1025
01:39:24,042 --> 01:39:25,459
Break!

1026
01:39:27,712 --> 01:39:30,297
Korba, cut it.

1027
01:39:43,686 --> 01:39:44,686
Move back.

1028
01:40:14,092 --> 01:40:15,884
This is part
of the weirding way

1029
01:40:15,968 --> 01:40:17,511
that we will teach you.

1030
01:40:20,098 --> 01:40:23,600
Some thoughts
have a certain sound,

1031
01:40:24,519 --> 01:40:26,770
that being
the equivalent to a form.

1032
01:40:27,397 --> 01:40:29,523
Through sound and motion,

1033
01:40:29,941 --> 01:40:34,069
you will be able to paralyze
nerves, shatter bones,

1034
01:40:34,487 --> 01:40:38,782
set fires,
suffocate an enemy,
or burst his organs.

1035
01:40:39,367 --> 01:40:40,450
We will kill

1036
01:40:40,535 --> 01:40:43,537
until no Harkonnen
breathes Arrakeen air.

1037
01:40:43,663 --> 01:40:46,081
ALL:
Muad'Dib!

1038
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:51,128
Chaaksa.

1039
01:40:56,592 --> 01:40:57,801
Stilgar.

1040
01:41:00,513 --> 01:41:01,722
FREMEN WARRIOR:
Muad'Dib.

1041
01:41:01,806 --> 01:41:02,806
Hmm?

1042
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:05,851
VOICE ON WEIRDING MODULE:
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.

1043
01:41:10,231 --> 01:41:12,649
<i>My name is a killing word.</i>

1044
01:41:13,735 --> 01:41:15,318
<i>They are ready to fight.</i>

1045
01:41:15,403 --> 01:41:16,987
<i>Yet in order to lead them,</i>

1046
01:41:17,113 --> 01:41:20,699
<i>I must conquer the worm,
conquer Shai-Hulud.</i>

1047
01:41:30,334 --> 01:41:33,086
Take the kiswa maker hook
of our sietch,

1048
01:41:33,838 --> 01:41:36,089
and ride
as a leader of men.

1049
01:41:52,064 --> 01:41:54,691
Shai-Hulud.

1050
01:42:34,899 --> 01:42:38,401
<i>I must not fear.
Fear is the mind killer.</i>

1051
01:42:46,911 --> 01:42:49,704
<i>Only the very strong ones
travel this deep.</i>

1052
01:42:50,373 --> 01:42:52,916
Usul has called a big one!

1053
01:42:53,417 --> 01:42:56,086
Again, it is the legend.

1054
01:44:34,352 --> 01:44:36,102
ALL:
Muad'Dib!

1055
01:45:08,886 --> 01:45:12,472
STILGAR:
Usul, these are 15
of our finest warriors

1056
01:45:12,890 --> 01:45:15,976
to serve you
as your guard.

1057
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:22,399
The Fedaykin.

1058
01:45:36,372 --> 01:45:37,372
Now.

1059
01:46:03,649 --> 01:46:07,152
<i>When the spice flow stops,
all eyes will turn to Arrakis.</i>

1060
01:46:07,945 --> 01:46:09,696
<i>The Baron
and the Emperor himself</i>

1061
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:11,406
<i>will be forced
to deal with us.</i>

1062
01:46:15,411 --> 01:46:17,912
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.

1063
01:46:17,997 --> 01:46:19,873
Muad'Dib.
Muad'Dib.

1064
01:46:19,957 --> 01:46:21,499
What happened?
Muad'Dib.

1065
01:46:21,667 --> 01:46:23,543
What happened to you
and your men?

1066
01:46:23,627 --> 01:46:24,919
Muad'Dib!

1067
01:46:25,004 --> 01:46:26,713
What are you saying?
What are you saying?

1068
01:46:26,797 --> 01:46:28,214
Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib!

1069
01:46:28,299 --> 01:46:29,924
Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib!

1070
01:46:31,969 --> 01:46:35,472
<i>He's been repeating that name
ever since we found him.</i>

1071
01:46:35,556 --> 01:46:39,559
Who is this Muad'Dib?

1072
01:46:46,192 --> 01:46:49,069
<i>PRINCESS IRULAN:
In the two standard years
that followed,</i>

1073
01:46:49,153 --> 01:46:50,528
<i>Muad'Dib and the Fremen</i>

1074
01:46:50,613 --> 01:46:53,615
<i>brought spice production
to a standstill.</i>

1075
01:46:54,033 --> 01:46:56,701
<i>Fearing for his life,
Rabban did his best</i>

1076
01:46:56,786 --> 01:47:00,038
<i>to hide this fact
from his uncle, the Baron.</i>

1077
01:47:06,837 --> 01:47:10,090
<i>Paul's sister Alia matured
at a frightening rate.</i>

1078
01:47:10,466 --> 01:47:13,510
<i>Her small body harbored
tremendous powers.</i>

1079
01:47:14,512 --> 01:47:17,138
<i>Paul and Chani's love grew.</i>

1080
01:47:22,645 --> 01:47:24,270
We surprised
a band of smugglers.

1081
01:47:24,355 --> 01:47:26,523
Too bad. I thought
they were Harkonnen.

1082
01:47:39,036 --> 01:47:40,203
Gurney!

1083
01:47:43,707 --> 01:47:46,459
You've no need of your weapons
with me, Gurney Halleck.

1084
01:47:47,211 --> 01:47:48,211
Paul.

GURNEY:
Paul!

Don't you trust
your own eyes?

1087
01:47:53,217 --> 01:47:54,926
They said you were dead.

They...

1089
01:47:59,515 --> 01:48:00,515
They said...

01:48:38,637 --> 01:48:39,846
<i>Silence. Do not speak.</i>

1099

<i>A new Fremen leader,

<i>Our navigators suggest

<i>No one on the outside world

<i>The Harkonnens

<i>Remedy this situation,
restore spice production,</i>

50 legions?

01:49:38,197 --> 01:49:39,822
That's our entire
reserves as well.

1118
01:49:39,907 --> 01:49:41,157
This is genocide,

1119
01:49:41,242 --> 01:49:43,284
the deliberate
and systematic destruction

1120
01:49:43,369 --> 01:49:45,703
of all life on Arrakis!

1121
01:49:47,289 --> 01:49:50,792
<i>PAUL:
The Emperor is coming!
Chani! Chani!</i>

1122
01:49:53,337 --> 01:49:57,340
You were calling my name.
It frightened me.

1123
01:49:58,300 --> 01:49:59,467
Oh, Chani.

1124
01:50:00,803 --> 01:50:03,012
All the images
of my future are gone.

1125
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:08,017
I have to drink
the Water of Life.

1126
01:50:08,269 --> 01:50:10,687
No, Paul, please.

1127
01:50:11,146 --> 01:50:12,897
I've seen the men
who have tried.

1128
01:50:13,023 --> 01:50:14,774
I've seen how they died.

1129
01:50:14,858 --> 01:50:18,695
I'm dead to everyone unless
I try to become what I may be.

1130
01:50:21,699 --> 01:50:24,200
Only the Water of Life
will free what can save us.

1131
01:50:30,874 --> 01:50:32,834
I must drink
the sacred water.

1132
01:50:36,130 --> 01:50:37,714
<i>PAUL:
I must go now.</i>

1133
01:51:32,644 --> 01:51:35,938
Hurry. All I see
is darkness.

1134
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:37,940
Paul.

1135
01:51:40,694 --> 01:51:45,114
I will love you forever.
You are my life.

1136
01:51:55,292 --> 01:51:56,584
You are my life.

1137
01:52:03,175 --> 01:52:05,218
<i>REVEREND MOTHER:
Many men have tried.</i>

1138
01:52:05,803 --> 01:52:07,845
<i>PAUL:
They tried and failed?</i>

1139
01:52:07,971 --> 01:52:09,639
<i>They tried and died.</i>

1140
01:52:18,357 --> 01:52:20,233
<i>The worm is the spice.</i>

1141
01:52:20,317 --> 01:52:22,235
<i>The spice is the worm.</i>

1142
01:52:42,423 --> 01:52:44,507
<i>PAUL: The worms.</i>

1143
01:53:01,150 --> 01:53:03,484
<i>CHANI: They're not attacking.
Why?</i>

1144
01:53:22,379 --> 01:53:23,546
Alia.

1145
01:53:25,215 --> 01:53:26,340
Mother.

1146
01:53:28,385 --> 01:53:30,219
It's Paul.

1147
01:53:32,639 --> 01:53:35,475
He's taken
the Water of Life.

1148
01:53:45,569 --> 01:53:49,906
<i>REVEREND MOTHER:
There is a place,

1152
01:54:06,423 --> 01:54:09,008
<i>Now I truly
control the worm</i>

1153

<i>and the spice.</i>

1154
01:54:13,263 --> 01:54:17,433
<i>And I have the power
to destroy the spice forever!</i>

1155
01:54:47,839 --> 01:54:48,839
Paul.

1156
01:54:50,133 --> 01:54:51,133
Paul.

1157
01:55:01,061 --> 01:55:02,436
Father!

1158
01:55:05,899 --> 01:55:07,024
Father!

1159
01:55:07,526 --> 01:55:10,486
The sleeper has awakened!

ALL:  Muad'Dib.

1161
01:55:28,922 --> 01:55:32,508
Arrakis, Dune,

01:55:34,553 --> 01:55:35,803
Desert Planet.

1163
01:55:37,556 --> 01:55:39,557
Your time has come.

1164
01:55:40,350 --> 01:55:42,184
A storm is coming.

1165
01:55:43,020 --> 01:55:44,520
Our storm.

1166
01:55:46,023 --> 01:55:49,317
And when it arrives,
it will shake the Universe.

1167
01:55:51,862 --> 01:55:55,489
Emperor, we come for you!

1168
01:55:57,492 --> 01:55:59,160
We come for you!

1169
01:56:13,842 --> 01:56:16,636
Long live the fighters!

1170
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:19,972
ALL:
Long live the fighters!

1171
01:56:51,296 --> 01:56:52,838
<i>MAN ON RADIO:
Suspicion confirmed.</i>

<i>The Emperor's

1173
01:57:37,968 --> 01:57:40,761
Gurney, when the storm hits,
set off the atomics.

1174
01:57:41,972 --> 01:57:44,890
I want an opening through
the entire shield wall.

1175
01:57:46,476 --> 01:57:49,270
Stilgar,
do we have wormsign?

1176
01:57:52,441 --> 01:57:53,858
Usul, we have wormsign,

1177
01:57:53,942 --> 01:57:56,485
the likes of which
even God has never seen.

1178
01:58:52,876 --> 01:58:56,962
Bring in that
floating fat man, the Baron.

1179
01:59:13,230 --> 01:59:15,064
Why have you
brought me here?

1180
01:59:15,232 --> 01:59:18,734
Your Highness,
there must be some mistake.

1181
01:59:19,361 --> 01:59:20,986
I never requested
your presence.

1182
01:59:21,238 --> 01:59:22,238
Ah.

1183
01:59:22,739 --> 01:59:25,074
But your lack of action
demanded it.

1184
01:59:25,158 --> 01:59:27,535
Your dreadful mismanagement,
your bad judgment

1185
01:59:27,619 --> 01:59:30,704
in assigning to Rabban
the governorship.

1186
01:59:31,122 --> 01:59:32,331
You've forced me
to come here

1187
01:59:32,415 --> 01:59:35,000
and set things straight,
personally.

1188
01:59:45,262 --> 01:59:49,223
ALIA:
I am a messenger
from Muad'Dib.

1189
01:59:49,850 --> 01:59:51,642
Poor Emperor.

1190
01:59:52,143 --> 01:59:55,938
I'm afraid my brother won't
be very pleased with you.

1191
01:59:56,022 --> 01:59:57,147
Silence!

1192
01:59:57,440 --> 01:59:59,441
Kill this child.
She's an abomination.

1193
01:59:59,651 --> 02:00:01,652
Kill her. Kill her.

1194
02:00:01,862 --> 02:00:04,738
Get out of my mind!

1195
02:00:04,823 --> 02:00:07,449
Not until
you tell them both

1196
02:00:07,534 --> 02:00:10,578
who I really am.

1197
02:00:12,163 --> 02:00:13,455
Alia,

daughter of Duke Leto
the Just,

1199
02:00:19,087 --> 02:00:22,298

of Paul Muad'Dib.

1202
02:00:28,805 --> 02:00:32,600
Paul's sister?
Paul is Muad'Dib?

1203
02:00:37,564 --> 02:00:39,481
Alia keeps pace
with the storm.

1204
02:00:44,529 --> 02:00:47,489
<i>PAUL: With the storm,
their air power
will be useless.</i>

1205

Gurney.

02:00:54,122 --> 02:00:55,122

Atomics!

1209
02:01:31,910 --> 02:01:37,039
My brother is coming
with many Fremen warriors.

1210
02:01:38,583 --> 02:01:39,750
Impossible!

1211
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:41,961
Not impossible.

1212
02:01:42,045 --> 02:01:45,339
I told you.
He is here now.

1213
02:01:52,263 --> 02:01:55,432
<i>Father, today
I will avenge your death.</i>

<i>SARDAUKAR OFFICER:

<i>The Shield Wall has been

Release the Sardaukar.

1218
02:02:29,009 --> 02:02:33,554

to the storm.

there are Guild Heighliners
above us,

1235
02:07:48,786 --> 02:07:51,246
containing many Great Houses
of the Landsraad.

1236
02:07:51,456 --> 02:07:52,831
Send them back.

1237
02:07:52,915 --> 02:07:54,833
How dare
you speak to me in...

1238
02:07:54,917 --> 02:07:56,793
<i>Stop your speaking.</i>

1239
02:07:58,921 --> 02:08:00,964
You have some idea
of what I could do.

1240
02:08:04,135 --> 02:08:07,012
Don't try your powers on me.

1241
02:08:08,139 --> 02:08:10,432
Try looking into that place
where you dare not look.

1242
02:08:10,516 --> 02:08:12,517
You'll find me there
staring back at you.

1243

You mustn't speak...

1244
02:08:14,187 --> 02:08:15,354
Silence!

02:08:18,733 --> 02:08:20,567
I remember your gom jabbar.

1246
02:08:21,694 --> 02:08:23,403
Now you'll remember mine.

1247
02:08:23,488 --> 02:08:25,280
I can kill with a word.

1248
02:08:27,784 --> 02:08:30,744
And his word shall carry
death eternal

1249
02:08:31,079 --> 02:08:33,205
to those who stand
against the righteous.

The righteous?

1251

There is
a Harkonnen among you.

1252
02:08:39,504 --> 02:08:43,423
Give the Harkonnen a blade,
and let him stand forth.

If Feyd wishes,

Who is the little one?
A pet, perhaps?

1265
