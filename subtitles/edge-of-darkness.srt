-Yeah.

Can I say how shocked we all were
to hear of Emma's death.

344
00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:25,184
She was a valued member of our team.

I can't say I knew her very well personally,

BENNETT:
In the '60s, this hill was excavated.

348
00:38:34,931 --> 00:38:36,899
It was a site for Nike nuclear missiles...

349
00:38:37,066 --> 00:38:40,900
...miles of tunnels and launch chambers.
I'm sure Emma told you.

00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,197
No, she never talked about her work.

00:38:43,373 --> 00:38:46,001
So Northmoor bought this
from the federal government?

did here.

00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:34,787
In what sense?

365
00:39:35,258 --> 00:39:36,953
She didn't tell you about her work?

366
00:39:37,126 --> 00:39:40,289
Perhaps because she was following
your security protocols.

367
00:39:40,697 --> 00:39:43,131
And what are they,
in your understanding?

368
00:39:43,299 --> 00:39:46,166
I don't understand anything.
She never talked about her work.

Right.

370
00:39:48,104 --> 00:39:51,039
Well, you understand that most
of what we do here is classified.

371
00:39:51,207 --> 00:39:52,401
Almost everything we do.

372
00:39:52,575 --> 00:39:57,239
What she did, despite her qualifications,
your daughter was a trainee.

373
00:39:57,413 --> 00:40:00,109
She was a full employee
and there's a benefit package...

374
00:40:00,283 --> 00:40:02,547
...which I suppose you should see
personnel about.

375

I'm not interested in that just yet.

Northmoor is essentially
a research facility.

380
00:40:17,934 --> 00:40:21,529
We have a mandate from government to
develop a safe and clean energy source...

...based on fusion technology.

00:40:28,911 --> 00:40:31,505
Well, if we did, it would be classified.

385
00:40:31,681 --> 00:40:33,410
I can tell you, you're a policeman...

386
00:40:33,583 --> 00:40:37,246
...and have access to this information
anyway. Northmoor's an important part...

00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:40,287
...of the nation's nuclear stockpile
and maintenance program.

388

We ensure that the nation's nuclear
stockpile...

...remains ready
for the president's order.

Emma was a part of this?

392
00:40:48,965 --> 00:40:52,401
God, no. As an intern, she didn't have
any direct involvement whatsoever.

393
00:40:52,568 --> 00:40:54,866
She worked on the research floor.

394
00:40:56,372 --> 00:41:01,071
We all very, very much regret
Emma's death.

395
00:41:01,911 --> 00:41:05,005
It must be especially painful for you
in the circumstances.

396
00:41:05,915 --> 00:41:09,078
You mean
that she was shot instead of me.

397

As a parent. I can only guess
at your pain. I think.

its full dimensions.

I'd like to talk to her friends, if any.

Northmoor isn't federal. I checked.

was involved with these people...

00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:50,541
...the most you could get her for
is trespassing.

486

Her apartment was tossed.
Her computer was stolen.

487
00:47:55,257 --> 00:47:57,953
And do the police know
that you know that?

Not the type.
My daughter was not a joiner.

502
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,866
She was more like me.

503
00:48:40,269 --> 00:48:43,466
If she did anything, whatever she did.
she would have done it alone.

504

There's a point when anybody
can become an activist.

that's so wrong you have to act...

She didn't say anything.

Emma was writing to Senator Pine.

she went to this greaseball local, a lawyer...

-...to see about getting out of her security--
-The name of the lawyer?

-Dampson or Danderman.
-Danderman.

she didn't go in the tunnels. I mean....

They were exposed, but she couldn't have
been exposed, she wasn't in the tunnels.

Well, it's always a pleasure

934

-How'd you do that at 20?

-No.
-Really?

939
01:24:30,992 --> 01:24:34,223
No. People talk about trauma
and so forth.

940
01:24:34,395 --> 01:24:37,592
I figure you pretty much come out
of combat the same way you went in.

941
01:24:37,765 --> 01:24:41,599
I know that's not a very kind thing to say,
but that's my observation.

in this post-traumatic stress thing...

How am I supposed to tell you

948
01:25:00,488 --> 01:25:05,050
Well, because you're seeing me in less than
48 hours after I talked to your attorney.

949
01:25:06,995 --> 01:25:11,489
Your daughter did come to me
with allegations about Northmoor.

950
01:25:11,666 --> 01:25:12,928
She sent me a letter.

What'd the letter contain?

952
01:25:15,336 --> 01:25:19,397
It touched on national security matters
that are classified.

-What happened to the letter?
-That's also classified.

959

that she might be in breach of security.

961

of your many years of service.

...and we have to say this
despite her terrible accident...

...was in violation of almost everything
of which she could be in violation.

-That's classified.

Her death was an accident.

977
01:26:38,987 --> 01:26:41,785
No, she was poisoned with thallium
by Mr. Bennett.

1231
02:00:07,114 --> 02:00:09,048
...a Boston police detective.
was the target.

1232
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:11,116
And what assumption
are we working on?

1233
02:00:12,920 --> 02:00:14,581
That he wasn't.

1234
02:00:33,182 --> 02:00:34,649
[SIGHS]

1235
02:00:43,158 --> 02:00:45,683
You were never afraid of the dark.

1236
02:00:46,762 --> 02:00:48,696
You're a brave girl.

1237
02:00:50,532 --> 02:00:53,729
If you'd been more afraid.
more like other people...

1238
02:00:54,603 --> 02:00:56,730
...maybe I'd still have you.

1239
02:01:01,076 --> 02:01:03,101
But I'd love you less.

1240
02:01:06,815 --> 02:01:08,248
Good night.

1241
02:01:11,587 --> 02:01:14,112
Next time, tell your old man, huh?

1242
02:01:32,715 --> 02:01:35,741
If you wanted me. I would've made time.
You're a little unstable right now.

1243
02:01:35,919 --> 02:01:38,319
If you dare think that you're safe...

1244
02:01:38,621 --> 02:01:41,522
...just because I can't prove anything,
you're very wrong.

1245
02:01:41,691 --> 02:01:44,353
I don't know what you're talking about,
and neither do you.

1246
02:01:44,527 --> 02:01:47,621
My driver is armed,
and you're a man distracted by grief...

1247
02:01:47,797 --> 02:01:50,322
-...in a state of paranoid confusion.
-You're probably right.

1248
02:01:50,500 --> 02:01:52,866
If he takes his hands off the wheel.
I'll kill him then you.

1249
02:01:53,036 --> 02:01:55,698
-What if I file a police report?
-Don't fuck with me. I'm a cop.

1250
02:01:57,807 --> 02:01:59,069
I'm gonna let you go now.

1251
02:01:59,776 --> 02:02:04,338
All you need to know is
I'm gonna get you.

1252
02:02:08,017 --> 02:02:09,644
Go ahead.

1253
02:02:10,305 --> 02:02:16,510
