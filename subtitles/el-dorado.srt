00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,716
Tomás.

3
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,951
A big fellow,
riding that Appaloosa stud out there,

4
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,996
he came in here a little while ago?

5
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,629
He in the washroom.
He shaves, he cleans up.

6
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,472
Thanks.

7
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,955
Hi, Cole.

8
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,268
That's a voice I'd know anywhere.

9
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,911
J P Harrah. Wait till I get
some of the soap out of my eyes.

10
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,956
I heard you were made sheriff...

11
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,593
- What's the idea of the gun?
- I don't know which side you're on.

12
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,831
- What do you mean?
- I heard you work for Bart Jason.

13
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,879
Nothing's set yet.

14
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,873
He offered me good money,
but I don't know what I have to do.

15
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,396
- Would you like to hear?
- Yeah, go ahead.

16
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,438
Cole,
that's close enough to that gun.

17
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,274
I just wanted to see
if you'd slowed down any.

18
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,749
Not that much.

19
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,149
What were you saying about Jason?

20
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,119
He showed up here around the end
of the war with a pocketful of money.

21
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,475
Nobody can find out where he got it,

22
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,074
but everybody else
around here was broke.

23
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,118
- You know how it was.
- Yeah, all over Texas.

24
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,193
Having money, he started to grow.
But now he needs more water.

25
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,316
There's only one place to get it.

26
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,109
Trouble is, somebody was there
ahead of him. About 20 years ahead.

27
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,156
A man named MacDonald got here

28
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,276
when there was nothing
but Indians and coyotes.

29
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,955
Mr MacDonald's got four boys
and a girl, all worked real hard.

30
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,635
They hung together through the rough
times, and now things are looking up,

31
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,314
MacDonald's in no mind to sell.

32
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,518
So he's holding and Jason's pushing,
and I'm standing right in the middle.

33
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,239
It's not the way it was told to me.

34
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,279
That's the way it is. I guess
you're supposed to take care of me.

35
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:38,436
Not that I couldn't do it, Harrah,
but I don't think I'd like that.

36
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,835
I'm glad to hear you say that.

37
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,037
Not that I couldn't handle you,
but I wouldn't like that either.

38
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,109
Suppose I tell that Jason that
I had a long talk with you,

39
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,589
and you scared me off.

40
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,910
- Good enough?
- Good enough.

41
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,077
You can put that thing down now.

42
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,958
Something familiar about that gun.

43
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,836
I just had it fixed like yours.

44
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,639
You got lucky with it,
I thought I'd try it.

45
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,199
Cole Thornton, you decent? You'd
better be, 'cause I'm coming in.

46
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,478
Good to see you.
I didn't believe you were here.

47
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,711
I thought you'd forgotten
all about me, I thought...

48
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,231
Hi, JP.

49
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,839
- What's so funny?
- This whole thing.

50
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,630
Do you know what
she's laughing about?

51
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,915
I gather you knew him
before you knew me.

52
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,788
- I knew her when she was a kid.
- Didn't you know that, JP?

53
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,874
You never mentioned that. Until now,
I thought you had good taste.

54
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,555
Until now,
I thought she had good taste.

55
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,949
I'm awful glad you two are friends.

56
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,315
We may not be
when we think this over.

57
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,518
- Then I'm through with you both.
- We better get ourselves a new girl.

58
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,194
- Yeah.
- You better not.

59
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,953
I'm girl enough for you both.
Can I buy you a drink?

60
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:07,070
I'd like that, but I promised JP
I'd do something for him, didn't I?

61
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,198
- You did.
- If you want to do my errand...

62
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,555
No, you do your own work, Cole.

63
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,429
- Will you buy us that drink later?
- Sure will.

64
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,875
Where is this Bart Jason's place?

65
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,235
You take the main road
north out of town.

66
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,073
You cross the creek,
and you come to a big rock.

67
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,277
- Big rock.
- Right. That's MacDonald's boundary.

68
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,112
MacDonald's?

69
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,796
Ride east from there about 3 miles
and you get to Bart Jason's ranch.

70
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,792
Maudie, remember, I'm coming back.

71
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,552
- I left some things...
- I'll take care of it.

72
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,551
Thanks.

73
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,916
- You mad at me, JP?
- You know better than that, Maudie.

74
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,956
You must like that man.

75
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,231
- Want me to tell you about him?
- You don't have to.

76
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,154
I know I don't.
That's why I want to.

77
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,392
I met Cole right after my husband
was killed. I did tell you that.

78
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,268
- Yeah, you told me.
- There I was, stranded...

79
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,319
A gambler's widow,
not a chip to my name.

80
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,469
Cole was awful good to me. Gave me
a stake, helped me get on my feet.

81
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,438
Never would take a...

82
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,952
I don't know, JP.
With Cole and me, I guess it's a...

83
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,271
- I'll always think of him as a...
- He's a top hand.

84
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,070
- I guess so.
- Well, Cole always was pretty lucky.

85
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,233
- Have you known him long?
- Yes, since before the war.

86
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,474
- We've travelled some together.
- Sure, I know what that means.

87
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,236
It means either you saved his life,
or he saved yours, or both.

88
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,437
And neither of you
will talk about it. Men!

89
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,195
Would you like it set to music,
with a full orchestra?

90
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,114
- I'll see you.
- Don't forget to come back.

91
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,829
- I won't leave you alone with him.
- You're not a friend.

92
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,792
Hell.

93
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,910
MacDonald. Kevin MacDonald.

94
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,594
Howdy, Roy. Something wrong?

95
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,070
Doc Miller said to tell you
Bart Jason hired himself a gunhand.

96
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,357
Cole Thornton. He rode
out there about an hour ago.

97
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,000
Doc wanted you to know.
He said be careful.

98
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,436
Thanks, Roy. Tell Doc
I'm much obliged to both of you.

99
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,834
Matt, you and Saul help me
take these horses back to the ranch.

100
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,833
Joey, go to the West Fork and tell
Jared to get back to the ranch.

101
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,672
OK, Pa.

102
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,754
- Luke.
- Yes, Pa.

103
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,072
Get onto that rock. If you see anyone
coming, fire in the air to warn us.

104
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,358
- All right, Pa.
- Wait a minute, I ain't finished.

105
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,836
As soon as you fire that shot,
jump on your horse and hightail it.

106
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,876
I hear you, Pa.

107
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,871
All right, let's go.

108
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,319
- Where can I find Mister Jason?
- He's up at the main house.

109
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,596
Mr Jason, you got a visitor.

110
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,109
- Cole Thornton?
- That's right.

111
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,838
I'm Bart Jason.

112
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,515
I've been expecting you. Get off your
horse, make yourself comfortable.

113
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,159
I won't be here long enough for that.

114
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,039
Here's what's left
of your expense money.

115
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,432
Sorry about the rest of it,
but that's the chance you take.

116
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,716
I've decided against working for you.

117
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,031
Before you even talked about it?

118
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,671
No, you wouldn't do that.
You must've talked to somebody.

119
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,479
I did. The sheriff.

120
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,074
His story is a little different
from yours

121
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:09,398
Well, perhaps the law
doesn't quite see it my way.

122
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,874
Since when did hired guns get choosy?

123
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,396
- You're paid to...
- I'm paid to risk my neck.

124
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,950
I'll decide where and when
I'll do it. This isn't it.

125
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,750
I've got an idea you just don't want
to go up against Sheriff J P Harrah.

126
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,035
You know, you're just about right.

127
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,909
- You think he's that good?
- I tell you he's that good.

128
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,272
And, Mr Jason,
I see you don't wear a gun.

129
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,432
So I guess you always hire it done.

130
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,797
I'll give you
a little piece of advice.

131
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:48,238
If this bunch is all you've got,
don't tangle with Harrah.

132
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,036
'Cause they don't look tough enough
to me to stomp a stringy jackrabbit.

133
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,796
Well, Thornton, if that's
the way you think, I don't want you.

134
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,871
That's good enough for me...

135
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:04,590
Fancy vest, go ahead
and pull that rifle if you want to,

136
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,478
but you better speak to your boss
before you use it,

137
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,869
'cause he'll be dead
before I hit the ground.

138
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,829
Don't be a damn fool, Joe.
Go over there where he can see you.

139
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,674
I'll remember what you said,
Mr Thornton.

140
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,716
You do that.

141
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,555
Don't shoot no more, mister.

142
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,392
Please.

143
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,116
I won't.

144
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,514
Let me have a look at it.

145
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,156
- It's bad, isn't it?
- It isn't good.

146
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,277
My insides feel like they're on fire.

147
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,079
- Can I make you more comfortable?
- No, don't touch me, please.

148
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,396
- What's your name, son?
- MacDonald.

149
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,436
Luke MacDonald.

150
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,396
I can't stand it.

151
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,348
- Kevin MacDonald's boy?
- One of 'em.

152
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,476
I'm gonna have to get you home.

153
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,314
No, don't move me.
Please don't move me.

154
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,557
It's no use. I know it ain't no use.

155
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,070
Pa told me. Just don't touch me.

156
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,992
Well...

157
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,435
- There were two shots, Pa.
- I heard 'em.

158
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,750
- Luke should be back by now.
- I know.

159
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,271
Oh, no.

160
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,669
- Are we going, Pa?
- Where?

161
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,878
- Luke could be in bad trouble.
- If he is, we won't be any help now.

162
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,475
He went there to warn us.
He's warned us.

163
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,678
Better off here, where there's cover.
Find a good place inside that shed.

164
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,876
José and Miguel, go with him.

165
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,794
Danny, Felipe, come here.
Over behind that wall.

166
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,950
You gals, get in the house.

167
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,999
- Matt, we'll wait inside.
- All right, Pa.

168
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,510
Matt, go to that window.
Do nothing till I tell you.

169
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,949
Come out and get your boy.

170
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,632
- He's dead, ain't he?
- He's dead.

171
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,712
José, Miguel,
get him down from there.

172
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,038
- What happened?
- Luke, he's been killed.

173
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,032
I'm waiting to hear what happened.

174
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,115
I'll tell you what happened.

175
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,873
You left a boy out there
to do a man's job.

176
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,309
He went to sleep.
When I came by, he woke up,

177
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,836
jumped up and started firing his gun.

178
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,276
All I saw was somebody
shooting at me from the rocks.

179
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,396
- Cole Thornton.
- Yes, ma'am.

180
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,152
I don't believe you.

181
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,437
I don't care much, miss,
whether you do or not.

182
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,156
Pa's handling this. Just wait.

183
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,549
Get in the house, girl.

184
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,589
How do you know he was asleep?

185
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,036
He told me that.

186
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,034
He told me his name.
That's how I knew where to bring him.

187
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,556
He said you told him what happens
to a man that's gut shot.

188
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,196
How he hasn't got much of a chance.
Did you tell him that?

189
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,236
I told him that.

190
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,595
Then you're partly to blame.

191
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,634
You'll find two bullets in him.
One of them's mine.

192
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,309
He was hurtin' worse
than he could stand.

193
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,755
Had a handgun that I didn't see.

194
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,430
Any more questions you want to ask?

195
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,549
No. I guess you're telling the truth.

196
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,757
If you weren't
you'd never have brought him here.

197
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,592
I thank you for that.

198
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,756
It don't help much.

199
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,869
I reckon you won't shoot
any more little boys, mister.

200
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,436
Next time you shoot somebody,

201
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,069
don't go near them
till you're sure they're dead.

202
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,833
I don't know why you're still alive.

203
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,356
I don't know how
I missed you from that range.

204
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,876
You didn't miss.

205
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,556
Now get out of here.

206
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,990
JP, open that window, will you?

207
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,436
That's better. The smell of that
chloroform's putting me to sleep.

208
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,958
Hold him, Maudie.
Don't let him move too sudden.

209
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,792
All right.

210
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,109
He'll be waking up now.

211
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,794
It's all right, Cole. It's Maudie.

212
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,996
All right, Maudie.

213
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,554
- Who are you?
- The name's Miller.

214
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,074
Some people call me a doctor,
some other things.

215
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,151
But I'm the only one in town.

216
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,914
- Did you get the bullet out?
- No.

217
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,597
Then why this bandage?
Let's get to it.

218
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,114
- I can't.
- Why not?

219
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,715
Because I'm not good enough.
That bullet's up against your spine.

220
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:38,590
If I try to get it out, I'll only
finish what someone else started.

221
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,309
- So what happens?
- You'll heal all right.

222
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,189
When you get to a big town, find
a doctor who knows more than I do.

223
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,714
One of them new-fangled squirts.

224
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:53,396
They'll fix you up in no time.
But don't wait too long to do it.

225
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:58,235
Any chance of gettin' some coffee
or a shot of whisky around here?

226
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,392
- Linda.
- Linda, bring both of them.

227
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,596
Can he be moved?

228
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,278
Sure, in a couple of hours.
But don't go bouncing him around.

229
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,716
He can stay here.
I'll make him comfortable.

230
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,756
I've got a fine bed at my place.

231
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:19,358
It's narrow, hard and uncomfortable,
but he won't get bounced around.

232
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,434
Señor Bull. He comes.

233
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,316
Bull always announces his arrival
that way?

234
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,313
Same way, different tune.
You better let him in.

235
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,393
What are you blowing,
advance or retreat?

236
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:02,316
Neither. Couldn't let one of General
Hood's Cavalry go without a goodbye.

237
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,678
- Who's goin' away?
- Cole's leaving tonight.

238
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,433
You got any objections, Doc,
I don't want to hear 'em.

239
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,837
Glad to get you off my hands.
Where you going?

240
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,751
Sonora.

241
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,637
Folks down there got a silver mine.
A little trouble.

242
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,676
Think I might be of help.

243
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,037
I brung along a little red-eye,
in case the sheriff runs out.

244
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,190
Somehow, I reckon he has.

245
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,999
Been here a long time,
nobody's offered me a drink.

246
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,833
- Why didn't you speak up?
- Thought you'd never ask.

247
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,879
- Maudie, get him a glass, will you?
- What'll we drink to first?

248
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,638
I guess I should have told you.

249
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,996
Sometimes you...

250
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,790
I was hoping
to see you alone before you left.

251
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,953
- It's better this way, Maudie.
- Come back, will you?

252
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:06,238
- I will when...
- When you can forget Luke MacDonald?

253
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,518
When you can look at the other
MacDonalds and not feel you owe them?

254
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,317
Pretty wise for a kid, Maudie.

255
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:19,640
I think you must be the only person
who thinks of me as a kid, Cole.

256
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,796
I don't really.

257
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,356
Please don't.

258
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,875
I'll see you, Maudie.

259
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,036
That the way you make your living?

260
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,237
By golly, Cole,
it sure is good to see you.

261
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,880
What sheriff had to hire you
for a deputy?

262
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,235
You're looking at him. Hiya, Cole.

263
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,636
Dodd Draper!
The last time I saw you two,

264
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,474
you were ten jumps ahead of a posse
raisin' dust for Mexico.

265
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:27,111
- Heard you got shot.
- That was six or seven months ago.

266
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,033
How about supper?
I'll buy you a beer, too.

267
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,270
We'd like to, but we're working men.

268
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,995
How about that cantina up the street?
Good place to eat?

269
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,197
- Good as any. You sticking around?
- Day or two.

270
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,033
Well, we'll see you later, Cole.

271
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,035
Your dinner will be ready
in one minute.

272
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,277
Bring something to eat. Plenty of it.

273
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,715
- Right away.
- Something to drink, also.

274
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,277
Five and one.

275
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,719
- Charlie Hagan.
- Yeah.

276
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,915
You want something from me?

277
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,791
- You don't remember me, do you?
- No.

278
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,274
- Do you remember this hat?
- Why would I remember a hat?

279
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,913
You killed the man
that was wearing it

280
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,072
Ladies.

281
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,516
Who was this fellow I killed?
A friend of yours?

282
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,431
You could say that.

283
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,833
- When did I do this, boy?
- Two years ago, come September.

284
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,195
You and three others.

285
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,636
Natchez-Under-the-Hill,
on the Mississippi.

286
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:13,596
He was a gambler, named
Johnny Diamond, kind of an old man.

287
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,438
- Shouldn't have taken four of you.
- Remember, Charlie?

288
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,876
I remember. He was a cardsharp.
He was cheating.

289
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,555
No, he was good.
He didn't have to cheat.

290
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,031
- It shouldn't have taken 4 of you.
- No, it shouldn't.

291
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:36,590
I'm sure glad you remember,
Mr Hagan. The other three did.

292
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:41,198
- The other three?
- Yeah, I caught up with them.

293
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,155
You're the last.

294
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,636
And now I think you better stand up.

295
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,793
Stand up, Charlie.
I'm curious to see how he does this.

296
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,956
He doesn't have a gun.

297
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,828
And like he said,
it shouldn't have taken four of you.

298
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,551
Stand up, Charlie.

299
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,036
You with the hat.

300
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,320
You killed Charlie
'cause he killed your friend?

301
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,437
- Right.
- Well, Charlie was a friend of mine.

302
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,955
So let's see you do that trick twice.

303
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,757
I'd let it drop.

304
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,030
- Me?
- You.

305
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,397
- Hope you don't mind.
- Always seems to take more than one.

306
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,636
That's because they're no good.

307
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,320
- Pick up your gun.
- What?

308
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,798
You want to try again, now?
Pick up your gun.

309
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,956
Against him, or you?

310
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,110
- Me first.
- Why should you go first?

311
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,156
- Pick it up.
- Wait...

312
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,196
Tell me later. Shut up!

313
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,953
Go on. You were willing
when you had a kid...

314
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,669
Hold it! Don't get mad, mister.

315
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,435
Before you start anything,
I can't afford to lose another man.

316
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:39,153
- You promise to take Milt's place?
- You got faith in me, don't you?

317
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,880
Faith can move mountains, Milt,
but it can't beat a faster draw.

318
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,953
There's only three men I know
with his kind of speed.

319
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:54,200
One's dead, the other's me,
and the third is Cole Thornton.

320
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,316
There's a fourth.

321
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,870
- Which one are you?
- I'm Thornton.

322
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,876
Glad you didn't try, Milt?

323
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,073
Pick up your guns, both of you.
Real easy.

324
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,118
Like he said, real easy.

325
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,749
And take him out of here.

326
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,710
I'd like to talk to you.
I'm Nelse McLeod.

327
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,236
I thought so. Pretty far
off your range, aren't you?

328
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,231
A little. Drink?

329
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,436
- Why not?
- You, too.

330
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,397
Glasses.

331
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,789
- You working now, Thornton?
- No.

332
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,476
- Is it all right if music play now?
- Yeah, sure.

333
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,598
You're not working. What would
you say if I tried to hire you?

334
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,349
- First I'd ask about the money.
- Money's good.

335
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,476
Then I'd ask about the job.

336
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,949
Good evening.
Thanks for the drink, gentlemen.

337
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,874
- Just a minute, son.
- I am not your son.

338
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,555
My name is Alan Bourdillion Traherne.

339
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,915
- Lord Almighty.
- Yeah.

340
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,275
That's why most people call me
Mississippi.

341
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,079
- Mississippi?
- I was born on the river in a boat.

342
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,197
You're pretty good with that knife.
Can you use a gun?

343
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,598
If I could, I'd be using one.
Good evening.

344
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,955
Just a minute, Mississippi.

345
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,908
Why do you have
such a great passion for my company?

346
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,992
Will you just relax
for a couple of minutes?

347
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,071
About that job.

348
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,913
A little range war
in the El Dorado country.

349
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,350
El Dorado?
Mind telling me who hired you?

350
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:42,115
Fellow named Bart Jason.
Do you know him?

351
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,990
We met. He offered me the job
a few months back. I didn't take it.

352
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,990
Do you know who you're up against?

353
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,799
Yeah. The sheriff, J P Harrah.

354
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,314
I understand he used to be
pretty good with a gun.

355
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,517
Not just pretty good, McLeod.
He's the...

356
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,149
- The fourth man you told me about.
- Right.

357
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,754
He used to be. He's not any more.

358
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,077
- What happened?
- What usually happens to a man.

359
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,912
A woman.

360
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,039
Seems he tangled with some wandering
petticoat, been drunk ever since.

361
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:19,276
You're moving in before he sobers up,
or before they get a new sheriff?

362
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,158
- And you're not coming in?
- No.

363
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,834
I suppose you have your reasons.

364
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,999
It's probably just as well.

365
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,390
With two like us in the same bunch,

366
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,392
sooner or later
we'd have to find out who was faster.

367
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,200
Yeah, I guess you're right.

368
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,676
So long, Thornton.

369
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,190
I thought we were going.

370
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,315
Mississippi, just listen.

371
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:56,155
McLeod, would you like to walk out
that door first, ahead of us.

372
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,317
No, I don't believe I would.

373
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,512
I didn't think so.

374
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,476
Can you hear me?

375
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:09,229
- We hear you.
- I'm coming out.

376
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,876
Where are you?

377
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:17,114
- Over here.
- Come on out.

378
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,435
Further into the light, hurry.

379
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,351
Now drop your guns.

380
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,196
Come here.

381
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,156
Inside.

382
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,351
- That all right, Thornton?
- Good enough.

383
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,273
Mississippi, get their guns.

384
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,319
If it's all right with you, we'll
drop 'em at the sheriff's office

385
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,472
and they can pick 'em up
on their way out of town.

386
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:00,315
- Sounds reasonable.
- Much obliged.

387
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,988
Call it professional courtesy.

388
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,396
Want to get something to eat?

389
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,918
I would've walked right into
those two, if you hadn't stopped me.

390
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,912
- I asked if you were hungry.
- I'm trying to thank you.

391
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,629
I'm hungry. That shivaree you put
on in there interrupted my supper.

392
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,676
It wore out our welcome.

393
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,910
We'll have to find
someplace else to eat.

394
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,277
- Now?
- Now.

395
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,550
She wants to know
if you want something else.

396
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,196
Just coffee.

397
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,274
- Not very hungry?
- No, not so much.

398
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,072
- A little green around the gills.
- Yeah.

399
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,873
I just finished something tonight
I've been two years doing.

400
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,033
What are you figuring on doing next?
Going back to the river?

401
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:17,074
I haven't thought much
about what I'm going to do next.

402
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,196
The river won't be the same
without old...

403
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:23,319
If you're going to stay around here,
I've got two pieces of advice.

404
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,598
Get rid of that hat.
Learn how to use a gun.

405
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,831
- I don't want to get rid of the hat.
- No?

406
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,196
No.

407
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:38,639
Johnny Diamond, he's the friend I...
the man that raised me.

408
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:46,037
All he left behind was
a gold watch and this hat.

409
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,910
I had to sell that gold watch
a year or so back.

410
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:54,789
So I guess
I'll just hang on to that hat.

411
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:58,037
What about learning to use a gun?

412
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,913
Johnny didn't believe in guns.
He always thought that...

413
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,594
He's dead. Think about that.

414
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,912
Unless you can
learn to stay out of trouble.

415
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,118
That's one thing even old Johnny
couldn't teach me to do.

416
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:16,352
Well, I'll be moving along.
Good luck to you.

417
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,112
You don't suppose
I could ride along with you?

418
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,840
- No.
- That's plain enough.

419
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,038
- I hope everything works out.
- What works out?

420
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,390
Whatever it is you're going to do.

421
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,671
Pay for the meal, will you?
So long.

422
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,348
Hold it, Cochise.

423
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,478
Steady boy. I'll take a minute.

424
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,476
Where are you?

425
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:41,229
Close enough to blow your hat off
if I hadn't recognised it.

426
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,919
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for you.

427
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,549
Don't you know better
than to follow a man that way?

428
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,473
- I don't know another way.
- You almost got shot.

429
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,398
- You fall off your horse?
- Yeah.

430
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,118
- You hurt?
- No.

431
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,156
Something's the matter.

432
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:11,631
I've got a bullet in my back, it
sometimes presses against something.

433
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:16,510
I get a screaming pain, then it goes
numb, and I can't use this hand.

434
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:20,719
- How long does that last?
- A while. Why are you following me?

435
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,548
I started thinking about
what you're going to do.

436
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,276
And what am I going to do?

437
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:32,878
You're going to El Dorado to help
your friend against McLeod.

438
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,560
How do you know he's my friend?

439
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,514
That look on your face when you heard
he'd turned into a drunk.

440
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,788
It's wearing off.

441
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,269
Give me a hand up on my horse.

442
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,674
You sure your friend's worth helping?

443
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:56,715
You spent two years chasing
the fellows that killed your friend.

444
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,917
You think your friend
was worth two years?

445
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,959
- I guess I asked a fool question.
- You did.

446
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,557
Give him a breather. Slow him down.

447
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:28,111
I was wondering.
Just how good is this McLeod?

448
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:33,633
I don't know first hand,
but they say he's one of the best.

449
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:38,999
I figure he'd be mad you turned him
down and showed up on the other side.

450
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:42,038
- I hope he is.
- How come?

451
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,317
Fellow in his business
hasn't got a right to get mad.

452
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,994
He gets mad, he's not so good.

453
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,117
So the madder he gets,
the better I like it.

454
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,839
Sure wish I was there to see that.

455
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,639
Why do you want to keep
sticking your nose in this?

456
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,917
Maybe I could help.
You saved my life two times.

457
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,356
But I'm going to be too busy
to keep doing that.

458
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,991
- You can't even use a gun.
- I need somebody to teach me.

459
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,469
Johnny Diamond always told me
to get the best.

460
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,519
He was right there.
But you're not going to El Dorado.

461
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:18,309
- I'm not?
- No, you're not.

462
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,914
"Gaily bedight, A gallant knight,

463
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:29,079
"In sunshine and in shadow,
Had journeyed long..."

464
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,595
- What's that all about?
- Just a poem.

465
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,636
One of Johnny Diamond's favourites.

466
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,553
Let's see: "Gaily bedight,
A gallant knight,

467
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,396
"In sunshine and in shadow,
Had journeyed long, singing a song,

468
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,273
"In search of El Dorado.

469
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:49,229
"Over the mountains of the moon,
Down the valley of the shadow,

470
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:52,039
"Ride, boldly ride..."

471
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:56,875
Always liked that poem, too.
Makes me want to...

472
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,511
Ride, boldly ride?
It don't work out that way.

473
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,670
I'm learning that.

474
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,193
Hell. Hold it, Cochise.

475
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,828
- Step down off that horse.
- You always giving people orders?

476
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,999
You wanted to learn to shoot.

477
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,076
Right out there.

478
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:45,319
Hold it, Mississippi.
That's no way to use a handgun.

479
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:49,359
You have to draw and fire,
quicker than the other person.

480
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,396
Like this.

481
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,397
I see.

482
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:05,038
- How's that?
- Were you aiming at that cholla?

483
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:11,110
- No, the place you were shooting at.
- 'Fraid it's useless.

484
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:17,397
We'll be passing through Cuervo.
I'll have a talk with the Swede.

485
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,550
Who's the Swede?

486
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,518
An old friend of mine, a gunsmith.

487
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,596
There's the place.

488
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:47,192
- Swede, good to see you.
- What brings you here?

489
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,035
I'm looking for a gun for a fella
that can't shoot. Mississippi.

490
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,951
Swede Larson.

491
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:57,794
- Can you help us?
- I've got just what you want.

492
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,757
Good.

493
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:07,110
How wide will that shot spread?
How big a pattern?

494
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:10,915
I don't know. The fellow who used it
before, he couldn't see too good.

495
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,594
He just shoot where he hear
somebody talk.

496
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,990
- What happened to him?
- He has a fight in a saloon.

497
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:20,072
The piano player
he make so much noise,

498
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,630
he couldn't hear the other man,
so he just shoot the piano player,

499
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,676
and they hung him.

500
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,797
- Looks pretty good to me.
- Shoots good, too.

501
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,950
How about ammunition?

502
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,589
- Four or five boxes are enough.
- Good.

503
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:38,559
- Looks like what you need.
- Sure is.

504
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,758
- Pay the man. Swede.
- Cole, you come back soon.

505
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,516
A likely spot to try that new gun.

506
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,556
Try that cactus.

507
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,075
You can't miss with that.

508
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,796
It's all right.

509
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:30,077
- How far to El Dorado?
- We'll be in there around midnight.

510
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,396
Where are we headed?

511
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,869
- To see a girl.
- A girl?

512
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,030
Yes, a girl.

513
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,475
Don't you think I could know a girl?

514
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,394
- I always make you mad, don't I?
- Mostly.

515
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,077
Hold it. This. This is it.

516
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,433
Keep it quiet. I need to talk to you.

517
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,351
I'll let you in.

518
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:45,156
- Keep your eyes open.
- You pick the darnedest times...

519
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,437
- Who's he?
- Alan Bourdillion Traherne.

520
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,990
- Just call him Mississippi for now.
- Hi, Mississippi.

521
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,036
- Stay there and watch.
- Couldn't I...?

522
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,997
No.

523
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:03,829
I'm so glad to see you.
I've got so many things to tell you.

524
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,948
I've got a lot to say to you, but
first I've got to have some answers.

525
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:13,511
- Are there any strangers in town?
- No, I'd have known if there were.

526
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,636
This one you'd have noticed:

527
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:18,996
a dark, thin faced man
with a scar and a marled eye.

528
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,753
- Nelse McLeod.
- Nelse? I've heard of him.

529
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,718
Should've had four or five
riders with him.

530
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,870
- He's not here yet.
- Good.

531
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,190
At least we beat them in.

532
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,396
Now, about JP.

533
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:37,032
- Want the whole story?
- Just don't make it too long.

534
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:40,192
After you left,
I didn't see much of him.

535
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:44,751
He'd drop in for a drink once
in a while. I guess he was lonely.

536
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:48,753
One day a girl came into town,
just stepped off the stage and...

537
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,751
You know how kind...

538
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:55,675
She probably had big sad eyes and
a long sad story. That's his type.

539
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,992
Yeah. She was no good.
I tried to tell him, so did others.

540
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:03,470
Bull told him
and he knocked Bull down.

541
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:08,076
So JP had found out the hard way.
She ran off with a drummer.

542
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,118
He's not been sober since.
It's been about two months.

543
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,237
Well, that he's going
to have to get over quickly.

544
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:18,996
- Is he over at the jail?
- He's sheriff, I don't know why.

545
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:23,870
We'll mosey... Have you got a room
for Mississippi and me?

546
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,873
Sure.
Have you eaten anything lately?

547
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:31,556
- No.
- I'll have something ready for you.

548
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,392
I'm glad you're here.

549
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:38,033
- Don't tell anybody you saw us.
- I won't.

550
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,879
- I found one thing out.
- What?

551
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,110
You know a girl.

552
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,032
Hold it.

553
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:02,395
It's as far as you can come now.

554
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,596
Unless you've got some business here.

555
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:11,355
I sure have got business here, Bull.
Cole Thornton.

556
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,552
If it hadn't been so dark
I might have spotted you.

557
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,870
Might have anyhow,
if I hadn't been trying to figure out

558
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,838
what that other fellow's
got on top of his head.

559
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,515
- It's called a hat.
- I'll have to take your word for it.

560
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:27,717
He's a friend of mine.
They call him Mississippi.

561
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,756
- Glad to know you.
- Bull.

562
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,156
Glad you're here, Cole.
Our friend the sheriff ain't so good.

563
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,276
I just talked to Maudie.

564
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:38,397
He's back there sleeping.

565
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,358
Being as how you've known him
longer than I have,

566
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,238
you know enough to be careful
how you wake him up,

567
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,754
'cause he's a bad one
when he's drinking.

568
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:50,832
He ain't put that stopper
back in that bottle in a coon's age.

569
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:55,835
I know. You got someplace where
you can put these horses under cover?

570
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,070
- Sure.
- Give him a hand.

571
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:03,439
Bull, I'd just as soon everybody
didn't know we were back in town yet.

572
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:07,354
- What's up? Something in the wind?
- Jason's starting some more trouble.

573
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,956
I ain't surprised.
My neck itches like it used to

574
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:16,079
when a Comanche was around
and I couldn't see him.

575
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,669
Damn you, Bull.

576
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,996
What the hell are you doing here?

577
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:33,108
I'm looking at a tin star
with a drunk pinned on it.

578
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,514
Cole Thornton. How about that!

579
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:44,353
How about that! It's good old Cole.
Help me up out of here, Cole.

580
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,835
Come on, just pull me right on up.

581
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,876
Cole, he won't feel it.

582
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,994
Well, I owe him one.

583
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:08,556
Either one of you know
a fast way to sober a man up?

584
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:11,797
A bunch of howlin' Indians
out for hair will do it quick.

585
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:14,269
Johnny Diamond had a recipe.

586
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:18,751
Let's see: cayenne pepper;
mustard, the hot kind; ipecac;

587
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:24,318
asafoetida; oil of cloves, or was
it...? No, it was croton oil.

588
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:30,117
Croton oil? I'll be a suck-egg mule!
You know what that'll do to a fellow?

589
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,077
Guaranteed kill or cure.

590
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,038
You know where you could get
that stuff this time of night?

591
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:38,908
Greener's store would have it.
May have to wake him up.

592
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,879
Go on with him, Mississippi.
Make sure he doesn't forget anything.

593
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,951
I... Look out, Cole!

594
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:57,112
Aren't you going to get that stuff?
He's all right.

595
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:02,320
- Get it before he wakes up again.
- Sure.

596
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:09,795
Let's see, we've got ipecac,
mustard, cayenne,

597
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:12,348
that leaves us asafoetida.

598
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:20,515
Are you sure that Johnny Diamond
wasn't an embalmer?

599
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,955
- Here's your gunpowder.
- Gunpowder?

600
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,112
Yeah. Mississippi remembered it
on the way to the store.

601
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,316
- Put it in.
- All of it?

602
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:33,349
- All of it.
- I hope you don't blow him up.

603
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,639
Well, it looks done.

604
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,436
Well, let's get it into him.

605
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:47,353
Bull, you sit on his legs.

606
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:52,312
- Cole, pin down his arms.
- Don't worry about us.

607
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,870
Get hold of his nose. If he can't
breathe, he'll have to swallow.

608
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:58,315
Give him one for me.

609
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:09,475
- All down.
- Let's get out of here.

610
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,510
Lock him in.

611
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:28,272
- We're coming in.
- Come ahead.

612
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,759
- Howdy, Cole, Mississippi.
- How's our friend?

613
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:38,356
Nary a peep. Not even moved,
not one twist the last two hours.

614
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:43,196
- You reckon he'll be all right?
- Ask him. It's his concoction.

615
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:47,717
I don't know how all right he'll be,
but he won't be drinking for a while.

616
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:50,314
- How come?
- It does something to the stomach.

617
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,789
- It won't hold liquor.
- You sure?

618
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,633
Sure, I'm sure, given he's human.

619
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,712
He's human all right.
He's got to be.

620
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,553
No other critter on earth
would make such a fool of himself.

621
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,276
Come open this door.

622
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:08,796
He's still drunk. Open it yourself,
it ain't even locked.

623
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,515
My friends.

624
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:31,996
My dear good friends.

625
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:36,069
You dirty, lousy, rotten,
sheep-herding...

626
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:41,154
What did you do to me?
What did you give me?

627
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,196
I'm all crawling inside.

628
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,511
Just hang on, sheriff.
It'll fetch you round.

629
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:50,434
- Who are you?
- We met last night.

630
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:54,149
Last night? When was that?
Come on, Bull. Where is it?

631
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,435
Top drawer of your desk.

632
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,756
- Nobody's going to try to stop me?
- Nobody.

633
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,956
That's a good thing.

634
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:20,876
You dirty...

635
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,630
Take a look.

636
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:57,153
All right, Bull. You better wake up.

637
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:01,552
- Jason brought his outfit into town.
- Could be to meet McLeod.

638
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,676
Yeah, could be.

639
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:09,069
- You going to tell the sheriff?
- No, let him sleep.

640
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,993
Here comes some more of them.

641
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:34,676
You gals do your shopping.
We'll meet you back here.

642
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:37,069
Stay together. Go on with them, Joey.

643
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:41,832
- Dusty out there.
- Who are they who've just come in?

644
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:45,515
MacDonalds. They come to town
every Saturday afternoon.

645
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,511
I wish they hadn't.

646
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:52,754
Bull, it'd be a good idea if you hung
around where the MacDonalds are.

647
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,916
I guess I'd better.

648
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,596
Watch out for 'em... We'll keep an
eye on our friend across the street.

649
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:04,356
If there's any trouble, I'll toot
my bugle, and you come running.

650
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,676
Toot my bugle!

651
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:46,116
- Hello, JP.
- Hi.

652
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,470
Can you see a little clearer
from here?

653
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:01,631
Hey, Cole.
How long have you been here?

654
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:05,035
Got in last night.

655
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:09,752
Did we have a fight or something?

656
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,837
Or something.

657
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:15,596
Yeah.

658
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:22,716
What are you doing here?
Why are you here?

659
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:27,759
Waiting for a fellow.
The name's Nelse McLeod.

660
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,079
- Nelse McLeod with the...
- That one.

661
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:35,550
- Want some coffee?
- No, I don't...

662
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:38,393
I met him down near the border.

663
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:41,597
Said he wanted me
to work with him on a job.

664
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,956
Range war.
But he said it would be easy.

665
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:47,315
All we had to worry about was a...

666
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,550
...drunken sheriff.

667
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:53,516
Sure you don't want coffee?

668
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:02,316
And he's working for Jason?

669
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,870
- That's what he said.
- Well?

670
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:08,396
I turned the job down.

671
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:12,870
Well, then why are you here, Cole?

672
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:16,909
I owe the MacDonalds.
Is that enough?

673
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:21,030
Yeah, that's plenty, Cole.

674
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:28,518
Cole, I gotta have a drink.

675
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:32,160
You won't find anything around here.

676
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:36,319
- Why?
- I told Bull to throw it away.

677
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:42,311
- Now would you like a cup of coffee?
- No, I don't want any coffee, Cole.

678
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,153
I want a drink!
Can't you see? I've got to.

679
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:48,550
- Go get one.
- Where's my hat?

680
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,437
This yours?

681
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:55,115
- Who are you?
- We met last night and this morning.

682
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:59,637
- Is this your hat?
- No, it's not my hat, but it'll do.

683
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:31,719
- Let me have some whisky.
- Just hold your horses, sheriff.

684
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,076
Good evening, sheriff.

685
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,469
Here you are.

686
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:40,835
I don't want a drink,
I want the whole bottle.

687
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:43,713
I'll have to fill one up for you.

688
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:59,311
- Isn't that...?
- That's McLeod, all right.

689
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,956
Well. Glad to see you.
I've been waiting for you.

690
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:24,429
I brought some boys with me here.

691
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:28,878
Hi. Nelse, let me introduce you
to the man I wanted you to meet.

692
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:32,589
Sheriff. This is Nelse McLeod.

693
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:37,396
McLeod, this is J P Harrah,
the sheriff of El Dorado.

694
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:43,919
He's the man who's responsible
for keeping order in this town.

695
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:46,071
Here you are, sheriff.

696
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:50,235
He's just getting his evening bottle.

697
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:29,031
Shouldn't you get out
of the middle of the street?

698
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,195
Cole, they laughed at me.

699
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:57,630
Right in front of McLeod,
they just laughed at me.

700
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:02,350
They've been laughing at you
for a couple of months.

701
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,748
You haven't been
sober enough to hear it.

702
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:12,919
They'll laugh no more.
I'll show them.

703
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,795
- What's that?
- Bull.

704
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:26,348
- Needs help.
- What is it?

705
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,476
Wait a minute. Now wait for...

706
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:30,511
- Wait for me.
- Why?

707
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:41,836
Over here!

708
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,354
The men that done it
took off this way.

709
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:46,312
Just a minute.

710
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:50,279
Jared. I asked you not to go.
I asked you.

711
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:55,271
You're always around,
when one of my boys gets hurt.

712
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:57,794
- How is he?
- He's alive.

713
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:59,996
Joey's gone for the doctor.

714
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:03,869
- Who did it?
- You were with him. What happened?

715
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:08,558
Three of Jason's men came up
behind us. One took my gun.

716
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,835
Then he started calling Jared names.

717
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:14,515
When he turned around, one grabbed
his arm, the other shot him.

718
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:18,036
- Then they ran away.
- What did they look like?

719
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,236
I know what they looked like.

720
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:23,790
One was tall, one was short
and one had a bad leg.

721
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:26,474
- Let's go find them.
- Wait.

722
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:29,199
- You're not going anywhere.
- Look who's here.

723
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:32,317
- A little late, ain't you?
- Stop for a drink?

724
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,391
All right, I'm late, maybe too late.

725
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,835
That's no reason
for the rest of you to get shot.

726
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,753
- Why?
- Because you're outclassed.

727
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:45,915
Sheriff's right. Jason's beat you
since McLeod and his gunmen rode in.

728
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:49,711
Jason's been waiting for him.

729
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:53,429
You go up against him now, you'll be
doing just what Jason wants.

730
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:58,071
- What do you expect us to do?
- Why don't you ask the sheriff?

731
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:02,116
The sheriff?
You think I'm going to wait on him?

732
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:08,800
Just give me an hour, MacDonald.
You can wait that long to die.

733
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:13,279
- You backing him up, Thornton?
- No, he's not.

734
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:21,037
I'd say I'm on your side,
and this is no job for amateurs.

735
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,436
They ran down this street
and turned left.

736
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:29,671
Too many for one man to take after.

737
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:34,515
If I was you, I wouldn't be
in a hurry to go up that street.

738
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:37,831
Them fellows acted just like
they wanted somebody to follow them.

739
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:40,673
I've seen Indians act just like that.

740
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:42,876
I'm going down this side...

741
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,428
What are you doing here?

742
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:48,990
- I'm going down the other side.
- Remember, I didn't ask you.

743
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:57,032
Come on, Bull, you follow me.
Not too close.

744
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:24,158
Don't turn around. It's better
no one sees me talking to you.

745
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:29,398
Just a minute. Go ahead.

746
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:33,319
Is it that you look for three men?

747
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:36,517
- That's right.
- One walks with a bad leg?

748
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,989
Another is very tall?

749
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:42,436
- They're the ones.
- They ran over there to the church.

750
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,556
They have not come out yet.

751
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:47,791
Thank you.

752
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:53,000
You do not need to thank me.
I do not like Bart Jason or his men.

753
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:55,310
Thanks again.

754
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,475
- What kept you?
- Talking to a girl...

755
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:03,312
A girl?

756
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:07,109
Don't you think I could know a girl?
She saw them run up to that church.

757
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:09,634
- She said they're still there.
- Still there?

758
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:12,837
- Yes, sir.
- Well, we can find out.

759
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:27,558
Girl said they were
up at that church.

760
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:33,072
- What are you going to do, sheriff?
- Go closer.

761
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:42,991
- Girl was right. They're up there.
- Sure are.

762
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:46,948
Hit me in the bugle.
Look, I got a dent in it.

763
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:54,239
Alongside that big bell
on that tower. I'll show you.

764
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:02,151
Ain't that pretty?

765
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:05,875
Go on shooting.
We'll try to move up a little closer.

766
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,993
Just give me another gun,
I'll play "Marching Through Georgia".

767
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:13,152
All right, start playing. Let's go.

768
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,109
Come on up, we'll cover you!

769
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,278
Bull, we'll shake them up a little.
Keep 'em occupied while we move in.

770
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,828
- Ready?
- Let's make some music.

771
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:46,916
Here they come.

772
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:59,512
All right, Mississippi. You watch
that roof and watch it good.

773
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,478
Sheriff, you... You all right?

774
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:08,512
No, you ain't.

775
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,716
I'm getting out of here.

776
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:19,793
I'm going to hit that door.
Now you get around that...

777
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:22,030
Watch that other door.

778
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:28,116
Look out up high!

779
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:21,116
- One of 'em got away, Cole.
- You ought to know. You missed him.

780
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:26,116
Over here!

781
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,632
Over here!

782
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:33,756
- Where'd you come from?
- I heard a noise.

783
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,910
- Did you get him?
- Who?

784
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,116
The fellow that ran
out of the church.

785
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:41,237
- Yes and no.
- What do you mean?

786
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:44,278
- I hit the sign and it hit him.
- Great.

787
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,989
- He was limping when he left.
- He was limping when he got here.

788
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,992
One of us must have done some
damage, there's some blood here.

789
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:54,231
- Anyway, he got away.
- Not far.

790
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:56,880
- Where'd he go?
- That saloon.

791
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,916
Jason's place.

792
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:02,272
Sheriff?

793
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:06,752
You ask me once more
what I'm going to do next,

794
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:10,310
I'll quit and leave
the whole thing in your hands.

795
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:14,279
Here, give me that,
or we'll be here all winter.

796
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:20,551
Well, I guess I'm going
to have to go in after 'em.

797
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:22,636
You know who'll be in there?

798
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:27,236
- There's two men I've got to get.
- Two men?

799
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:31,393
The man that shot the MacDonald kid,
and the man that sent him to do it.

800
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:33,596
- Bart Jason.
- That's right.

801
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:35,671
I was wondering
when you'd get around to that.

802
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:40,834
I may be a drunk,
I may not be able to load my own gun,

803
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:43,195
but don't tell me how to do my job.

804
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,836
I hope you're good enough.

805
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:51,628
So do I. So do I.

806
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:57,836
I'm going to go round the back.

807
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:00,388
You walk along that side
of the street

808
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:06,954
If they got somebody posted outside,
you walk to the jailhouse and wave.

809
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,996
You'll need this.

810
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:11,435
Don't let your shaking hands
near the trigger!

811
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,988
- Don't get on me.
- I ain't started yet.

812
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:17,436
This is really
going to be something to see.

813
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:20,717
- Who the hell are you?
- Wait a minute.

814
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:26,318
He's a little green. The fellow
you're after has got a bad leg.

815
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:28,436
Sure, Cole.

816
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,954
The back door's through there.

817
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:00,828
If you go in real quiet,
they may not know you're there.

818
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,549
- Give me time to go to the front.
- We'll watch.

819
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:12,995
- You being fair?
- What do you mean?

820
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:18,154
- Letting him go in there.
- I'd hate to try and stop him.

821
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:22,279
They laughed at him, Mississippi.
That'll make the difference.

822
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:33,229
All right, let's get on.

823
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:38,599
If you have to use that thing,
make sure which way it's pointed.

824
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:20,959
- What do you want here, sheriff?
- I want two things.

825
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:24,277
First I want the man that just
came in here.

826
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:28,069
- Nobody came in here.
- Stay away from that gun, Elmer.

827
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:30,714
Move up the other end of the bar.

828
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:34,111
No, I wouldn't do it, McLeod.

829
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:37,510
The rest of you, don't plan anything.

830
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:41,559
- You decided to take a hand.
- Never figured it any other way.

831
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:47,673
Keep that gun pointed right
at this table, both barrels.

832
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:50,035
Go ahead, JP.

833
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:52,951
You...

834
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:58,195
- You said that nobody came in here?
- That's right, nobody came in.

835
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:03,400
How come there's a trail of blood
leading right up to that table?

836
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:08,275
Joe, you're playing
a lot of sour notes on that piano.

837
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:11,193
- I know.
- You don't look very happy.

838
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:15,193
- I'm certainly not.
- Like to move away from that piano?

839
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:17,748
- Darn right I would.
- Then move!

840
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:41,399
You said...
I told you, get away from that gun.

841
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:43,915
Get up the other end of the bar.

842
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:50,795
You were saying...
nobody walked in here.

843
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:54,316
Get up. Get up.

844
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:59,159
Nobody came in here, laughing boy?

845
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:03,313
Let me hear you laugh.
Come on, let me hear you laugh.

846
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:07,830
Now you, Jason...
Get out of my way.

847
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:11,959
You thought it was funny too, didn't
you? Why aren't you laughing now?

848
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:15,999
It's the same drunken sheriff,
the same hat, why don't you laugh?

849
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:18,316
Let me hear you laugh!

850
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,716
I don't know who you think you are...

851
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:29,876
All right, Cole.

852
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:36,839
You're lucky, Jason.
'Cause I wanted to kill you bad.

853
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:39,796
Come on, you're under arrest.

854
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:44,110
You just going to sit there, McLeod?

855
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:49,558
There really isn't much
I can do right now, is there, Jason?

856
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:54,590
I'll give you $1,000
the day you get me out of jail.

857
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:56,511
$1,000.

858
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:59,797
Listen, McLeod.
You make one move toward that jail,

859
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:04,078
and it'll be hard to collect that
mone 'cause your boss will be shot.

860
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:07,789
So you and your boys get out of town
by morning, understand?

861
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,995
- Ready, Cole?
- Whenever you are.

862
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,195
Let's go.

863
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,439
Cover us. Get out of the way.

864
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,956
All right, Mississippi.

865
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:02,556
What you looking at?

866
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:04,710
There's somebody out there
with a gun.

867
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:09,157
- Everybody in town's got a gun.
- Not pointing at us, though.

868
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:11,629
Where was this fellow?

869
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:14,109
In that livery stable
across the street.

870
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:17,511
It's too soon for one of the McLeods.

871
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:19,795
- I'll take a look.
- I don't know...

872
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:21,836
I'll be careful.

873
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:26,391
Go around the back way. Soon as
you're out the door, turn right.

874
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:30,519
If you're not back in five minutes,
I'll come after you.

875
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,798
- Listen, sheriff...
- You listen, Jason.

876
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:43,589
Unless you want only bread
and water until the marshal arrives,

877
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:45,716
you be absolutely quiet.

878
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,913
- We got away with it.
- Yeah.

879
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:12,319
You were pretty good in there.
Like old times.

880
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:15,516
Don't tell me I was good.

881
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:19,115
I got away with it
because I had a hangover.

882
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:24,320
I was too mad to be scared and sick
to worry about it. You know that.

883
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,516
I've been there.

884
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:31,037
Next time
it's not going to be so easy, is it?

885
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:34,078
Next time they'll be ready for you.

886
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:38,557
Who figured out that stuff
you people poured into me?

887
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:44,509
- Where is Mississippi?
- Who is Mississippi?

888
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:47,717
That's the kid
that was around with us all night.

889
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:50,598
- Where is he?
- That's what I was asking.

890
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:54,753
Across the street at the stables.
Saw somebody pointing a gun after us.

891
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:59,274
- He ought to know better.
- Want me to go after him?

892
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:01,999
You ought to know better.

893
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:05,993
The first time in months
I've felt like doing nothing for you,

894
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:09,038
now you don't want me to do it.

895
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:12,789
Was there something wrong with that,
or is it just my hangover?

896
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:15,870
You made better sense
when you were drinking.

897
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:17,712
Must be whisky someplace.

898
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:09,714
- Hey, you're a girl.
- Course I'm a girl.

899
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:13,349
Hold still...
Just hold still now, miss.

900
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:17,308
Hold still. You're going to lose
your clothes if you keep that up.

901
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:20,796
All right. All right. I'll quit.

902
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:23,678
- You sure?
- I told you, didn't I?

903
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:27,594
- All right.
- How'd you know I was in here?

904
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:33,436
I saw your gun barrel sticking out
that window. Who are you after?

905
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:37,678
Bart Jason. You were so close around
him that I couldn't get a clear shot.

906
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:41,595
Are you going to keep sitting on me?

907
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:44,832
Well, I'm comfortable, and I...

908
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:49,039
I told you not to do that.
Don't do it and hold still.

909
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,355
- What's your name?
- Joey.

910
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:56,196
Josephine MacDonald.

911
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:01,428
Well, come on.

912
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:10,831
If you are a MacDonald, you've got
a right to want to shoot Jason.

913
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:16,719
You're one of the ones
that took him to the jail.

914
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:20,076
- Yes, ma'am.
- I recognise the hat.

915
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:23,113
- Why do you wear that silly thing?
- Never mind.

916
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,077
Why?

917
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:28,516
It was given me
by a Cherokee medicine man,

918
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:32,395
who said, if I wore it, people
wouldn't ask me fool questions.

919
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:36,837
- That wasn't a fool question.
- Then I'll ask you one.

920
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,276
Why do you wear your hair
like some wild mustang

921
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:42,510
that needs a curry-comb and a brush?

922
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:44,432
I don't think...

923
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:48,438
Don't do that again,
'cause I can hit harder than you.

924
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:52,115
- Damn you.
- Look, I'm on your side.

925
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,796
I was wrong.

926
01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:01,271
I ought to be thanking you
for helping us, not hitting you.

927
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:03,317
Yeah, well...

928
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:08,476
- Can I have my rifle?
- Not till we find out who you are.

929
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:12,439
- I told you who I am.
- You just say so. We'll go find out.

930
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:16,109
Bull, what did Mississippi say...?

931
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:19,078
Going to the stable
across the street.

932
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:23,950
- I guess I'd better go find out.
- Hey, in the jail. Mississippi.

933
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:28,113
- Come on, open the door.
- Hold your horses.

934
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:32,357
Found this girl in that stable
opposite, pointing a gun.

935
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:34,829
- Hello, Joey.
- Sheriff.

936
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:36,797
Hello, Mr Thornton.

937
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:39,516
May I have my gun?

938
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,477
- Sure.
- Thanks.

939
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:44,757
Just who were you aiming
to shoot, Joey?

940
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:48,155
Jason.

941
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:51,278
Didn't the last time
you shot a man teach you anything?

942
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:54,352
There ain't any mistake about Jason.

943
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:57,074
We didn't have much hope in you,

944
01:25:57,160 --> 01:26:02,188
so Pa and the others are waiting
for him, out on the street.

945
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:05,670
- We thought you weren't good enough.
- Sober enough.

946
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:07,990
- We were wrong.
- Yeah...

947
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:12,073
Joey, you better
round up your family,

948
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:15,197
tell them to go home
until this thing's over.

949
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:18,989
You can also tell them we've got
the man that shot your brother.

950
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:23,079
- How is your brother?
- He's got a good chance.

951
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:25,595
I'm glad.

952
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,636
You going to be able to hold Jason?

953
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,832
- He'll stand trial.
- Will he get what he deserves?

954
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:34,674
I don't know. I'm not the judge,
I'm just the sheriff.

955
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:39,115
Could I see him, talk to him?

956
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:41,953
Sure, just let me have that gun.

957
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:49,039
Never mind. Guess I'll be going.

958
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:52,032
- You want me to go with you?
- Why?

959
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:54,759
Well, I don't know...

960
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:57,997
They haven't gotten around
to shooting women yet.

961
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,670
You're doing what you think is right.

962
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,550
And for what you're doing, thanks.

963
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:06,676
All of you.

964
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:14,271
- She would've shot that fellow.
- She shot me.

965
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,556
She...?

966
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:20,556
She's something.

967
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:45,032
McLeod and his men
just left from across the street.

968
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:47,475
Do you think he's pulling out?

969
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:51,753
Fellow in his line of work can't,
once he takes a job.

970
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:53,796
I hear he's part Indian.

971
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:56,678
Could be he wants us
to think he's leaving.

972
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:58,716
Could be.

973
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:04,670
Got that feeling in the back of
my neck that says trouble's coming.

974
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:09,237
- What time do you reckon it is?
- Around 11, 12.

975
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:13,035
- Sheriff wanted to be woke up.
- What for?

976
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:18,194
Before he tried to drink the town
dry, we used to make a patrol.

977
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:23,235
Well, don't wake him up. He's been
through enough for one night.

978
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,036
You and I will have a look around.

979
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:31,671
If you're going to do that,
here's a couple of badges.

980
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:34,636
Raise your right hand.

981
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,754
I forgot the words,
but you'd better say, "I do".

982
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:42,952
- I do.
- Now you're deputies.

983
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:47,033
You suppose these'll do any good
if somebody shoots at us?

984
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:49,190
It'll give 'em a good target.

985
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:53,589
You'd better come lock this door
after us.

986
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:06,311
Take a look-see in at Jason's.
I'll take this side.

987
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:02,954
- What was that?
- I don't know, but I don't like it.

988
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:06,596
Look out!

989
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:31,676
Get him inside.

990
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:39,156
Close the door.

991
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:47,037
- You hit bad?
- No, a nick. It missed the bone.

992
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:49,076
What happened out there?

993
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:51,196
I told you to stay out of sight.

994
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:54,312
How's a body see anything
from around the corner?

995
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:59,872
- I've got to cut these pants.
- Go ahead. You got a knife?

996
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:04,750
I suppose I've asked this before,
but just who... Who is he?

997
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:06,990
Tell him your name, Mississippi.

998
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:11,750
Alan Bourdillion Traherne.

999
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:15,719
- No wonder he carries a knife.
- You need a doctor.

1000
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:20,592
Could you go and get Doc Miller
here without getting yourself shot?

1001
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:25,595
If I thought I would get shot,
I wouldn't go. Back as soon as I can.

1002
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:31,116
Here.
Use this till the doctor gets here.

1003
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:34,600
How did this mess get started?

1004
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:38,992
A bunch of men on horseback
came flying around the bend and...

1005
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:42,835
What was the idea
of diving under those horses?

1006
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:45,556
Diving under those horses?

1007
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:48,200
A man can't shoot good
when his horse is jumping,

1008
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:50,476
and a horse won't step on a man.

1009
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:54,109
- He won't?
- He will?

1010
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:56,634
Alan Bourdillion Tra... who?

1011
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:14,155
There's nothing in there.

1012
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:16,800
Sheriff, you've got nothing
to worry about.

1013
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:19,110
Lift your leg a little, please.

1014
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:23,034
Thornton, did you ever
get that bullet out of your back?

1015
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:25,076
No, I never did.

1016
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:30,752
I said you need someone better than
me to do it. I've got the man here.

1017
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:35,311
- Doctor Donovan, got a spare minute?
- Yes, doctor.

1018
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:37,675
Hold your finger right here.

1019
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,990
No, no, here. That's it.

1020
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:46,991
This fellow's got a bullet in him.

1021
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:52,279
Went in the left side about here,
and moved toward the spine.

1022
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:55,432
- About here?
- A little higher.

1023
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:57,511
Yes, I feel it.

1024
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:59,989
- This may hurt.
- It did.

1025
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:04,432
That's very odd. Does it hurt here?

1026
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:06,556
- No.
- Doctor...

1027
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:08,631
Just a minute.

1028
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:11,757
- What do you think?
- It's a challenge.

1029
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:16,436
I reckon he's got a more interesting
misery than you, sheriff.

1030
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:20,433
Doctor, I don't want to take up your
time, but mine's still bleeding.

1031
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:23,432
You've got nothing to worry about,
it's a clean wound.

1032
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:26,910
- It's giving you trouble, isn't it?
- I wouldn't say...

1033
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:31,039
- Why don't you tell him the truth?
- I can guess.

1034
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:35,636
Sudden spasms of pain and paralysis
of one side, probably the right.

1035
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:38,917
- It doesn't last long.
- But longer each time, right?

1036
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,956
What are you trying to tell him?

1037
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:44,953
If the bullet is not removed,
he'll have an attack that won't pass.

1038
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:47,793
McLeod may settle the problem for us.

1039
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:51,589
But if I'm here after all this,
I'll come and see you.

1040
01:33:51,680 --> 01:33:55,468
- You do that.
- Now, doctors, if you please.

1041
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:58,711
Could you come here,
so I can rest my finger?

1042
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:00,552
Sure.

1043
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:21,556
Why don't you settle down?

1044
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:25,952
- I've got the shakes so bad...
- You've had them before.

1045
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:29,635
Not with a bullet wound and a bunch
of unfriendly people outside

1046
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:33,633
- Just waiting for somebody...
- What do you want to do?

1047
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:35,597
Quit?

1048
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:41,276
The only thing I can think of is
don't use the door, don't go outside.

1049
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:44,432
- You mean hole up?
- Sure, they won't come in here.

1050
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:46,511
When do you expect the marshal?

1051
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:49,433
I don't remember the last time
he was here.

1052
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:52,558
He was here.
You gave him a big welcome.

1053
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:55,313
- Flung a bottle at him.
- An empty bottle?

1054
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:57,436
Yeah, he wasn't that far gone.

1055
01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:00,910
- When's the marshal due?
- Four or five days.

1056
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:04,072
- Got enough food?
- Plenty of coffee and water.

1057
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:08,629
Could you slip out the back
and get some food?

1058
01:35:09,080 --> 01:35:12,436
- Without getting shot?
- I wish you would.

1059
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:15,671
Does he want me
to get shot or get food?

1060
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:20,470
- Want me to come?
- If I get shot, you get the food.

1061
01:35:20,680 --> 01:35:24,559
And I'm also going
to bring back a big bar of soap.

1062
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:26,995
This place'll never be Delmonico's,

1063
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:30,675
but the food would taste better
if you'd use that soap.

1064
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:34,196
- Just get.
- I'm going.

1065
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:41,238
I suppose I could use a little bath.

1066
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:44,959
I'd appreciate it.

1067
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:52,434
- Morning, Joey.
- Morning. I brought some...

1068
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:56,272
- Good morning, sheriff.
- I'm taking a bath.

1069
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:59,796
Don't mind me, sheriff,
I was raised with four brothers.

1070
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:03,589
- I'm not your brother.
- Doc Miller sent over these crutches

1071
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:07,389
and some clean clothes.
He also sent some soap.

1072
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:09,914
And I brought an extra one...

1073
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,070
You already have some.

1074
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:15,630
- I've got a lot of friends.
- Well, I'll be going.

1075
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:18,672
Morning.

1076
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:23,669
What are you doing still in town?

1077
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:28,317
We came to take my brother
Jared home, he's a lot better.

1078
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,118
When you get home...

1079
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:33,397
I remember: stay close and watch out.

1080
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:35,311
Right.

1081
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:37,789
You look a lot better
without that hat.

1082
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:39,916
Thank you.

1083
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:45,472
Wait. Don't close that door.
Morning, Joey.

1084
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:47,949
Hi, Mississippi, Bull. Morning, Cole.

1085
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:52,909
Good morning... I'd have more privacy
in the El Paso railroad station.

1086
01:36:53,120 --> 01:36:55,475
Hello, JP. How are you?

1087
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:57,790
I'm thinking of selling tickets.
I'd get rich.

1088
01:36:57,880 --> 01:37:02,032
I got here just in time.
Here's a bar of soap.

1089
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:05,829
- Just what I need.
- What happened to your leg?

1090
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:10,714
- Will you get out of here?
- All right, JP. What happened?

1091
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:14,634
- He'll be fine. A nick in the leg...
- I thought...

1092
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:17,439
You ought to have better sense
than to come here...

1093
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:21,308
Better sense...? I brought you
some food. I'll take it back...

1094
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:24,949
- Just a minute...
- Sometimes you make me so mad...

1095
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:29,393
- What?
- He's trying to tell you

1096
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:31,869
that it's not safe to come here.

1097
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:35,714
Somebody sees you come in here,
they tell McLeod,

1098
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:38,633
then McLeod tries to use you
to get to us.

1099
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:40,676
I never thought of that...

1100
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:43,115
Something else.
She shouldn't go out the front door.

1101
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:46,636
- 'Cause McLeod...
- Well?

1102
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:51,159
All right, let her come
through this way. I'll close my eyes.

1103
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:54,997
- Come on.
- You might as well leave the basket.

1104
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:59,039
- Sure, Mississippi.
- Come on, Maudie.

1105
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:11,191
You in the jail.

1106
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:17,313
- Who is it?
- Polly, with a note.

1107
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:19,356
Don't see nobody with her.

1108
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:23,758
- Come in, Polly.
- Hi, sheriff.

1109
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:26,479
Maudie asked me to bring this to you.

1110
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:30,235
I'm scared. Those men waiting
around... All the girls are scared.

1111
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:32,834
I know, Polly. What does she say?

1112
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:36,708
What I feared. McLeod's men
are hanging around her place.

1113
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:40,998
She says watch out
'cause she overheard enough to know

1114
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:43,992
that they've got something planned.

1115
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:46,668
I guess you'd better get down there.

1116
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:51,311
Yeah. Mississippi,
you want to ride, boldly ride again?

1117
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:53,391
Might be some trouble.

1118
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:56,916
"Over the mountains of the moon
Down the valley of the shadow"

1119
01:38:57,080 --> 01:38:59,833
- "Here we come."
- OK, Bull.

1120
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:14,471
Look out!

1121
01:39:20,840 --> 01:39:22,956
The window. Get their attention.

1122
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:30,190
Steady down! A man came in here.

1123
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:32,391
Out the back way.

1124
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:34,675
Through that door.

1125
01:39:36,640 --> 01:39:40,713
- Don't these fellows look familiar?
- Our friends from the border.

1126
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:43,877
Milt and Pedro. Where's McLeod?

1127
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:48,078
- I don't know.
- They wait for people outside doors.

1128
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:52,836
- Makes you wonder about that door.
- You're learning, Mississippi.

1129
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:56,799
Any reason why you want us
to go out that way?

1130
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:59,269
- He went that way...
- Pedro's telling the truth.

1131
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:02,830
He better be because you're going
out that door. You first, Milt.

1132
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,070
- No, please.
- Come on, Milt.

1133
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:07,037
Not that way.

1134
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:12,315
I'm tired of being taken for a fool.
Come on, move.

1135
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:15,437
- Please, don't.
- On your way.

1136
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:18,239
I lied. There's somebody out there.

1137
01:40:18,440 --> 01:40:23,116
- I know.
- Wait, I'll go. I'll go.

1138
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:27,239
- You sure will.
- Don't shoot, it's Milt.

1139
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:32,589
- All right, it's your turn.
- No, please!

1140
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:35,638
You're next. Move!
Go on, Pedro, move...

1141
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:48,714
You all right? What is it, Cole?

1142
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:53,433
Well, Thornton,
this is better than I expected.

1143
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:58,079
Pick him up and take him out of here.
Joe, give 'em a hand.

1144
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:07,838
- Can you see anything?
- Hardly anybody on the street.

1145
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,753
They've run into trouble sure enough.

1146
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:13,035
They should've been here an hour ago.

1147
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:30,874
- Who is it?
- Mississippi. Come on, open up.

1148
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:39,836
- Where's Cole?
- McLeod's got him.

1149
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:46,036
- Then someone gave me a headache.
- It was Jim Purvis, Jason's foreman.

1150
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:49,635
- Maudie'll tell you the rest.
- Was Cole all right?

1151
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:53,952
He was all right,
except his side seemed numb.

1152
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:56,793
- Did they take him away?
- They carried him out.

1153
01:41:56,880 --> 01:42:00,111
While they were gone,
we got Mississippi into my room.

1154
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:04,796
They didn't seem to want to try
to take him 'cause they had Cole.

1155
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:11,990
- Well, it's not too good, is it?
- It sure ain't.

1156
01:42:12,160 --> 01:42:15,948
I wouldn't look so happy because
if anything happens to Cole...

1157
01:42:28,160 --> 01:42:31,470
Get back! Stay back.

1158
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:33,516
Sheriff, can you hear me?

1159
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:36,114
- It's Nelse McLeod.
- I hear you.

1160
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:41,513
Thornton's got something wrong
with him, but it wasn't our doing.

1161
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:44,438
We got four or five guns on him,

1162
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:46,551
so don't try and move him.

1163
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:48,949
Bull, watch Jason. Mississippi.

1164
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:52,157
We've got enough guns
on your boss to do the job.

1165
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:56,199
- I expected that.
- What's your deal?

1166
01:42:56,280 --> 01:43:00,319
You send out Jason alive,
and you get your friend.

1167
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:09,475
- All right, Bull. Let him out.
- Sheriff, you can't do it.

1168
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:13,235
You free Jason,
McLeod can do anything he wants.

1169
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:17,074
- What chance you got then?
- Just open the door.

1170
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:37,119
That's far enough, Jason.
Bull, come watch him out the door.

1171
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:40,431
All right, Jason. Come on.

1172
01:43:41,640 --> 01:43:46,031
Get back here by this window.
Don't open it. Just stand ready.

1173
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:47,912
Slowly.

1174
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,833
Go on. Through the door,
close it behind you.

1175
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:56,474
- I can't with his feet there.
- Move them.

1176
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:03,720
That's right. Slowly.

1177
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:14,239
Get him out of here and get something
in front of that door.

1178
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:28,439
- Are you all right, Cole?
- I guess so.

1179
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:35,148
Well, JP,
you made a great bargain.

1180
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:38,993
You sold out
the whole MacDonald family.

1181
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:43,674
- For what?
- Go ahead, tell me about it.

1182
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:46,320
Tell me about how
you'd have done it different.

1183
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:50,071
You're going to have to face 'em

1184
01:44:51,120 --> 01:44:54,237
It's my fault, but they'll blame you.

1185
01:44:55,880 --> 01:44:57,632
Yeah.

1186
01:44:57,840 --> 01:44:59,796
In the jail.

1187
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:03,310
Thornton, I'm sorry
it had to end this way.

1188
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:06,915
I'll always wonder
which one of us was best.

1189
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:16,354
- Can you feel that?
- No.

1190
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:19,955
- Or that?
- It's almost like it was last night.

1191
01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:22,634
Last night your whole side was dead,
not just your arm.

1192
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:26,713
- It never lasted all night before.
- You may have waited too long.

1193
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:29,837
Can't you get that bullet out,
doctor?

1194
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:33,037
I could,
but he says he has too much to do.

1195
01:45:33,120 --> 01:45:37,238
I don't know how he'll do it. You
going to look out the window all day?

1196
01:45:37,320 --> 01:45:40,756
Yes.
McLeod let us leave town too easy.

1197
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:48,559
Joey MacDonald
and Saul MacDonald's wife's coming.

1198
01:45:48,640 --> 01:45:50,517
Could be trouble.

1199
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:54,673
- See if anybody's following them.
- Bull, you watch them, too.

1200
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:06,273
- Sheriff, we want to talk to you.
- What's wrong?

1201
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:08,874
- Lots.
- Jason took my husband, Saul.

1202
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:11,394
- Took him?
- Yes, they've got him.

1203
01:46:11,480 --> 01:46:13,710
You were supposed
to tell your family to watch out.

1204
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:16,917
Cattle got to be watered,
Mr Thornton.

1205
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:20,436
A Mexican boy was with Saul.
They sent him back with a message:

1206
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:24,559
Saul can live if Pa gives
his water rights to Jason.

1207
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:26,710
- Will he?
- There's no choice.

1208
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:29,155
You know
they'll never give Saul back.

1209
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:32,676
Jason doesn't want
Saul or your father around.

1210
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:35,035
to testify as to how
he got the water.

1211
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:39,557
- You have to do something, sheriff.
- Nobody's trailing.

1212
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:41,995
- When's your father meant to do it?
- Tonight.

1213
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:45,709
8 o'clock. They're bringing Saul to
the saloon. Pa's to bring the deed.

1214
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:48,439
They said they'd kill Saul
if anybody tried anything.

1215
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:52,832
That's what you said about Jason,
wasn't it, that you'd kill him?

1216
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:55,798
- And you didn't.
- No, he didn't.

1217
01:46:55,880 --> 01:46:58,838
- What are you going to do now?
- They've got McLeod,

1218
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:02,469
some gunhands and your brother.
Look around.

1219
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:05,472
We've got two cripples,
a green kid and a noisy old...

1220
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:07,869
- Indian fighter.
...lndian fighter.

1221
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:10,428
How do I know what I'm going to do?

1222
01:47:10,520 --> 01:47:13,034
Go back and tell your pa

1223
01:47:13,120 --> 01:47:15,509
we're going to do whatever we can,

1224
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:18,478
but it's up to him
whether he gives up or not.

1225
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:23,671
It's my fault. If I hadn't shot you,
none of this would've happened.

1226
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:26,797
- You will try?
- Yes, ma'am. We'll try.

1227
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:29,075
We'll be going.

1228
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:37,234
Well, sheriff,
what are we going to do?

1229
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:39,276
I don't know, Bull.

1230
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:44,395
Like I told the lady,
I just don't know.

1231
01:47:55,280 --> 01:47:57,316
Can you hit anything?

1232
01:47:57,400 --> 01:48:01,109
If I can get close enough.
Load it, will you?

1233
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:03,873
How're you going to get close enough?

1234
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:08,915
Ride up to Jason's in a wagon.
You've got a wagon, haven't you?

1235
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,753
- A big one.
- Are you crazy?

1236
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:14,354
- He's making sense.
- They'll think I'm useless.

1237
01:48:14,440 --> 01:48:16,874
I got away with it. He can.

1238
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:21,511
Last time you took the front, I took
the back. This time, the reverse.

1239
01:48:21,680 --> 01:48:24,558
We'd better go
before we think about it too much.

1240
01:48:24,680 --> 01:48:28,468
The best time to arrive would be
just before they expect MacDonald.

1241
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:30,630
Eight o'clock, Joey said.

1242
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:33,188
You'd better hook up a couple
of wagons.

1243
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:36,955
Come on, Mississippi,
before they think up something else.

1244
01:48:49,680 --> 01:48:51,796
Give me the gun.

1245
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:58,431
- Can you see it from there?
- Can't see a thing.

1246
01:48:58,520 --> 01:49:00,590
How you going to get down?

1247
01:49:00,760 --> 01:49:03,957
That's easy. I'm going to fall down.

1248
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:07,031
How're we going to time this thing?

1249
01:49:07,120 --> 01:49:10,317
They're sure to have
somebody out back watching.

1250
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:12,550
Trying to tell me my job, Cole?

1251
01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:17,316
I'm interested. I don't know how long
I can keep them busy out front.

1252
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:19,834
We'll be as quiet as we can.

1253
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:23,435
If we do it before you star shooting,
Bull will blow his horn.

1254
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:26,273
What if they shoot before he toots?

1255
01:49:26,440 --> 01:49:28,510
In that case, you're on your own.

1256
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:31,512
Wait a minute! I got an idea.

1257
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:36,314
- Can I ride with you?
- It won't be pretty.

1258
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:40,515
- I'd like to be around.
- You'll get off when I say?

1259
01:49:41,480 --> 01:49:44,233
- I'll get off.
- Come ahead.

1260
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:51,115
Give me something to lean on.

1261
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:55,356
"And when his strength
failed him at length

1262
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:57,636
"He met a pilgrim shadow

1263
01:49:57,720 --> 01:50:00,871
"Shadow, said he
Where can it be

1264
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:03,556
"This land called El Dorado?"

1265
01:50:05,400 --> 01:50:08,676
- I'll see you, Cole.
- I hope so.

1266
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:17,316
I'm coming.

1267
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:19,876
What are you doing
with that bow and arrow?

1268
01:50:19,960 --> 01:50:22,520
Like Cole said, got to be quiet.

1269
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:24,556
Can you hit a barn with that?

1270
01:50:24,640 --> 01:50:27,791
Ain't going to try to hit a barn,
just a man.

1271
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:34,831
"Over the mountains of the moon
Down the valley of the shadow

1272
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:37,190
"Ride, boldly ride,
The shade replied

1273
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:39,236
"If you search for El Dorado"

1274
01:50:54,680 --> 01:50:58,389
Well, Maudie,
this is as far as you go.

1275
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:01,352
All right.

1276
01:51:04,280 --> 01:51:07,556
- Nothing to say?
- Would it do me any good to say it?

1277
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:10,552
- Say what?
- That this is crazy.

1278
01:51:10,640 --> 01:51:12,915
No, I'm not going to say anything.

1279
01:51:13,080 --> 01:51:16,038
I'm just going to buy you a pine box.

1280
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:18,589
About six foot six...

1281
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:23,515
The MacDonalds. Hold 'em back.
Tell 'em to give us five minutes.

1282
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:26,072
Bye, Cole.

1283
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:11,469
- They've got a lookout.
- Got to get rid of him.

1284
01:52:11,560 --> 01:52:15,314
- Can you hit him with that bow?
- Can't miss.

1285
01:52:15,400 --> 01:52:18,153
- Might he yell when he gets hit?
- Yes.

1286
01:52:18,240 --> 01:52:20,151
Hold it.

1287
01:52:20,920 --> 01:52:23,957
I got an idea. Here.

1288
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,958
Hold that. Take good care of that.

1289
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:43,070
What in tarnation you doing?

1290
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:47,156
See you rater.

1291
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:57,513
What are you trying to say?

1292
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:03,829
- You can't go in there.
- Oh, no?

1293
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,673
So solly. Come on.

1294
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:16,836
Go on in, Bull.

1295
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,275
Joe never was much good
on that piano.

1296
01:53:34,360 --> 01:53:37,511
You shooting them strings
didn't help none, neither.

1297
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:52,756
Cole Thornton's coming.

1298
01:53:52,840 --> 01:53:57,197
Chuck, you and a couple of boys
stay with the kid.

1299
01:54:12,120 --> 01:54:14,873
Didn't expect to see you here,
Mr Thornton.

1300
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:18,710
- Hello, McLeod.
- I said...

1301
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:21,712
My show, Jason. Hi, Thornton.

1302
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:25,833
There's a little question
unanswered between us.

1303
01:54:25,960 --> 01:54:29,350
- Which one of us is best?
- That's right.

1304
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:32,398
I don't think we're going
to find out the answer.

1305
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:36,189
- No?
- No. Your gun hand's no good.

1306
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:42,268
Give me time to get down
and we'll find out.

1307
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:47,550
- Why should I give you time?
- Call it professional courtesy.

1308
01:54:48,280 --> 01:54:51,590
- Don't even listen. Why should you?
- Curiosity, Jason.

1309
01:54:51,680 --> 01:54:55,468
All right, Bull. Get that one
close to the MacDonald boy.

1310
01:54:55,840 --> 01:54:59,150
When you hit him, blow that bugle.

1311
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:04,669
Well, my better judgment tells me
that I can't...

1312
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:26,629
Freeze it right there, Johnny.

1313
01:55:59,120 --> 01:56:01,634
- Where's Saul?
- In there, he's all right.

1314
01:56:01,720 --> 01:56:05,872
- I told you to stay out of this.
- I'm glad she didn't.

1315
01:56:05,960 --> 01:56:08,599
- Much obliged, Joey.
- I owed you.

1316
01:56:19,360 --> 01:56:22,830
You didn't give me any chance at all,
did you?

1317
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:28,279
No, I didn't.
You're too good to give a chance to.

1318
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:34,238
I let a one-armed man take me.

1319
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:42,917
JP, look.

1320
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:46,430
Now that I don't need it,
it's working pretty good.

1321
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:48,670
That's always the way, isn't it?

1322
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:52,637
- What's going on out there?
- Town's fit to bust out.

1323
01:56:52,720 --> 01:56:56,429
Be a big time tonight.
Every son feels like hollerin'.

1324
01:56:56,520 --> 01:56:59,034
- How's your leg, Cole?
- Ask the doc.

1325
01:56:59,120 --> 01:57:03,159
It's not too bad. You know these
are buckshot wounds, don't you?

1326
01:57:03,240 --> 01:57:05,674
- I thought so.
- Who was using a shotgun?

1327
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:09,395
- A certain young man...
- I was, Doc.

1328
01:57:09,600 --> 01:57:12,512
- I thought you were on their side.
- He was.

1329
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:14,716
I told you I was no good with a gun.

1330
01:57:14,920 --> 01:57:17,275
Trouble is,
Cole was in front of the gun.

1331
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:20,796
The safe place is behind Mississippi
when he shoots that thing.

1332
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:24,793
You, too, Bull?
I think I'll take a little walk.

1333
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:26,916
- See that gal?
- What gal?

1334
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,434
The one that thinks
you look better without that hat.

1335
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:33,308
- Tell her why you're wearing it.
- I've already told her

1336
01:57:33,480 --> 01:57:37,439
She's mad. Said you let her make
a fool of herself.

1337
01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:41,911
A host of friends.
I have a host of friends.

1338
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,389
- Sorry about that leg.
- Forget it.

1339
01:57:44,680 --> 01:57:47,797
Yeah. I'll see you.

1340
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:52,314
That'll be a little sore for a few
days, but it'll be all right.

1341
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:54,595
Hope you have time to let me fix
your back.

1342
01:57:54,680 --> 01:57:58,832
- As soon as this leg heals, Doc.
- I'll be ready.

1343
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:05,429
- Hey, Cole, where's Maudie?
- I was wondering about that, too.

1344
01:58:05,600 --> 01:58:09,115
I left her down the street
just before this ruckus started.

1345
01:58:09,200 --> 01:58:11,350
She'll probably
be around pretty soon.

1346
01:58:11,560 --> 01:58:13,790
I wouldn't count on that too much.

1347
01:58:13,960 --> 01:58:16,838
- I just talked to her.
- Well?

1348
01:58:16,920 --> 01:58:20,595
If you was running for president,
you wouldn't get her vote.

1349
01:58:20,680 --> 01:58:22,636
What did I do?

1350
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:26,269
She said she was plum through
waiting on a man

1351
01:58:26,360 --> 01:58:30,478
whilst he's running around being
a target for anybody with a gun.

1352
01:58:30,560 --> 01:58:32,994
- Said she couldn't take it no more.
- She did?

1353
01:58:33,080 --> 01:58:36,550
Yeah, and she added a few frills
and dressing.

1354
01:58:36,680 --> 01:58:40,070
The main idea was,
the door was closed.

1355
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:45,595
- What are you going to do?
- What can I do?

1356
01:58:45,680 --> 01:58:47,671
Can't argue with a closed door.

1357
01:58:47,760 --> 01:58:50,320
Glad to hear you say that.
Better just drop it.

1358
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:53,392
- What can...?
- Others would try persuading her.

1359
01:58:53,480 --> 01:58:56,358
You get into trouble
with those women. Remember me.

1360
01:58:56,440 --> 01:58:59,318
You saying
I'm in the same mess you were?

1361
01:58:59,400 --> 01:59:01,038
I didn't say that.

1362
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:03,714
You think I'd make
a fool of myself like you?

1363
01:59:03,800 --> 01:59:07,031
You said yourself,
you cannot stand to be tied down.

1364
01:59:07,120 --> 01:59:11,432
Maybe I've had enough of selling
my gun arm all over the place.

1365
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:13,476
You said yourself...

1366
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:15,710
- Don't put words in my mouth...
- I'm not.

1367
01:59:15,800 --> 01:59:19,998
And if somebody's going to tell me
about women, it won't to be you.

1368
01:59:20,080 --> 01:59:22,150
- Where is Maudie?
- Her place.

1369
01:59:22,240 --> 01:59:24,356
- That's my crutch.
- Where's the other one?

1370
01:59:24,440 --> 01:59:26,635
Right over there, under your nose.

1371
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:29,872
- I can't decide for myself!
- It's under the wrong arm.

1372
01:59:30,520 --> 01:59:35,913
How would you know? You've been
using it under both arms.

1373
01:59:36,040 --> 01:59:40,875
Fine friend! Trying to keep a fellow
from doing what he wants to do.

1374
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:46,398
The way to get him to do something
is to say not to do it.

1375
01:59:46,480 --> 01:59:48,516
Not if he didn't want to.

1376
01:59:48,600 --> 01:59:51,273
- Reckon he'll stay here?
- Could be.

1377
01:59:51,360 --> 01:59:53,920
Be a good thing to have him here.

1378
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:57,959
Suppose you'll likely to wait a bit,
find a new gal,

1379
01:59:58,040 --> 02:00:00,190
make a fool of yourself
all over again.

1380
02:00:00,280 --> 02:00:03,875
Most likely. If you leave me,
I could be driven to it.

1381
02:00:03,960 --> 02:00:06,713
- I ain't said that.
- As good as.

1382
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:09,030
Now, stop putting words in my mouth.

1383
02:00:09,120 --> 02:00:12,635
I can't do anything right,
according to you. Bull, I need you.

1384
02:00:12,720 --> 02:00:14,950
- You what?
- I need you.

1385
02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:18,112
If you start being nice to me,
I'll quit you for sure.

1386
02:00:18,200 --> 02:00:22,352
Shock'd be too much. I'd sooner have
you hungover and nasty.

1387
02:00:22,440 --> 02:00:26,274
Speaking of that,
how about a little drink, Bull?

1388
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:31,069
Darn it! Took you a long time
to think of that one.

1389
02:00:33,080 --> 02:00:37,232
- That was good work, sheriff.
- Thank you, friend.

1390
02:00:37,320 --> 02:00:41,677
Sheriff, it looks like
you're going to keep your job.

1391
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:45,389
Yeah, it'll be a nice quiet town
after you leave, Cole.

1392
02:00:45,480 --> 02:00:47,630
How do you know I'm leaving?

1393
02:00:47,720 --> 02:00:51,076
We just don't need
your kind around here.

1394
02:01:16,200 --> 02:01:17,519
