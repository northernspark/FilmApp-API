{3277}{3337}Claire?
{3489}{3564}- Move up.|- Thank you.
{3772}{3861}Roast mules go topsy-turvy.
{3865}{3942}Ten letters ending in "T."
{3946}{4005}- I'm hopeless at this.|- Me too.
{4009}{4079}"Somersault. "
{4128}{4164}Bletchley.
{4457}{4504}It's a walk.
{4508}{4561}I know.
{4565}{4626}I've been here before.
{4695}{4741}This bus for Yardley--
{4818}{4864}This bus for--
{5376}{5485}Hello? Yes.|I'll try that extension for you.
{5489}{5541}Please hold the line.
{5545}{5623}I'm just putting you through.
{5627}{5687}Yes, you're through.
{5691}{5737}- Mr Skynner?|- Come in.
{5741}{5796}It's been a pleasure, sir.
{5825}{5886}I never wanted you back.
{5890}{5944}Logie says he needs you.
{5985}{6060}Well...
{6064}{6118}he's got you.
{6155}{6264}Conference in half an hour.|And keep your mouth shut.
{6268}{6332}You're only there for show.
{7060}{7151}Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.|You do look bloody terrible.
{7240}{7343}- We missed you, Tom.|- I know why you want me back, Guy.
{7347}{7428}You've lost the crown jewels,|haven't you? You've lost Shark.
{7492}{7579}We got a call from one of the|intercept stations in Scarborough.
{7583}{7665}And they started picking up a single|word broadcast on the hour, every hour...
{7669}{7725}coming out of U-boat headquarters|in Sainte-Assise.
{7729}{7793}- In Morse?|- No, it was a human voice.
{7796}{7848}- "Akelei. "|- Meaning what?
{7852}{7934}- It's a flower.|- I know it's a bloody flower, Guy.
{7938}{8022}Aquilegia. Columbine.|But what did it mean?
{8026}{8110}It meant,|"Change the weather code. "
{8114}{8219}The Germans have switched their U-boats to|a new code book, and we're blacked out again.
{8223}{8279}Is that why the Yanks are here?
{8283}{8332}Skynner's in a panic.
{8336}{8404}They want to take over his empire.
{8437}{8490}Here comes our team.
{8654}{8764}- You! You!|- Hello.
{8793}{8883}- You in the Royal Navy?|- Oh, I'm sorry.
{8887}{8966}- Only for a day or two. I mean, actually on a ship.|- What was your ship?
{8970}{9065}Look, I can't be expected|to remember every little thing.
{9069}{9134}Sorry.
{9138}{9222}Welcome to Bletchley Park, sir.
{9226}{9285}Three convoys left New York|in the past week...
{9289}{9355}and are presently at sea.
{9359}{9410}Convoy SC 122.
{9414}{9506}Fifty merchant ships|carrying fuel oil, tanks...
{9510}{9626}iron ore, bauxite,|also meat, sugar and wheat.
{9630}{9706}Convoy HX 229 departed|New York on Monday.
{9710}{9791}Forty merchant vessels|carrying explosives, manganese...
{9795}{9857}timber, powdered milk.
{9861}{9946}Convoy 229-A left New York|on Tuesday...
{9950}{10026}carrying steel, timber,|powdered milk.
{10030}{10086}I don't want a shopping list.|What's the total?
{10090}{10178}One hundred and forty-one merchant ships,|gross tonnage just under a million tons.
{10182}{10258}- Plus cargo of another million.|- And where are the U-boats?
{10322}{10398}A submarine tracking rumour|had three U-boat packs operational...
{10402}{10492}in the North Atlantic|as of 00 hundred Thursday...
{10496}{10564}here, here and here.
{10568}{10642}Midnight Wednesday?
{10646}{10728}- So where are the U-boats now?|- I'm afraid I have no idea.
{10769}{10886}I thought that was why we were here.|Our intelligence has been shut off.
{10890}{10966}You're telling us that the largest|assembly of merchant shipping...
{10970}{11020}we've ever sent|across the North Atlantic...
{11024}{11095}is now steaming towards|the largest concentration of U-boats...
{11099}{11166}the Germans have ever put|in the North Atlantic...
{11170}{11259}and you don't know where the hell|the goddam U-boats are?
{11263}{11316}- Gentlemen, if I may--|- Shut up.
{11391}{11453}What are our convoys making, hmm?
{11457}{11511}Something over 220 miles a day.
{11552}{11634}Well, I'd say we have|four days, maximum...
{11638}{11752}before the convoys come in operational|range of where you last had the enemy.
{11756}{11823}So, Leonard, this blackout--
{11827}{11885}will it be over in four days?
{11889}{11939}Uh, it's possible.
{11943}{11996}Yes, well, all things are possible,|Leonard, but is it likely?
{12000}{12092}Is it likely that you can break this|code, this, um-- What'd you call this?
{12096}{12186}This Shark? Before our convoys come|in range of the U-boats.
{12190}{12280}- We'll give it every priority.|- Yes, I know damn well you'll give it every priority, Leonard.
{12284}{12412}- That's not the question.|- Well, sir, as you press me, yes, I think we may be able to do it.
{12582}{12640}Is that what you all believe?
{12644}{12736}Um, well, I suppose you could say we know more|about Shark now than we did the last time.
{12740}{12868}If Guy thinks we can do it,|I would certainly respect his opinion.
{12872}{12949}And you?
{12953}{13008}You don't seem|to have much to say.
{13012}{13144}Tom Jericho. He's the one who got us into|reading Shark. If there’s anyone alive--
{13148}{13228}Can you break Shark again|in four days?
{13358}{13432}Have you any idea|what you’re talking about?
{13436}{13511}Tom's been on sick leave for the last month,|so I don't think he's fully in the picture--
{13515}{13591}Enigma is a very sophisticated|enciphering machine...
{13595}{13659}and Shark|is its ultimate refinement...
{13662}{13759}so we're not talking|about The Times' crossword.
{13792}{13856}It weighs 26 pounds,|battery included...
{13860}{13910}and goes anywhere.
{13914}{13996}The Enigma machine.|The Germans have thousands of them.
{14000}{14046}What's it do?
{14050}{14116}It turns plain-text messages|into gobbledygook.
{14120}{14185}Then the gobbledygook|gets transmitted in Morse.
{14189}{14305}At the receiving end, there's another Enigma|machine to turn it back into the original message.
{14309}{14384}Press the same key any number of times,|it will always come out different.
{14388}{14481}- And you have one of your own.|- Courtesy of the Polish Cipher Bureau.
{14485}{14561}So what's the problem?
{14565}{14618}Problem?
{14622}{14743}The problem is the machine has 115 million|million million ways of doing it...
{14747}{14840}according to how you set these three|rotors and how you connect these plugs.
{14844}{14887}And that's Shark.
{14891}{14965}No. No, no, no.|This is the one we can break.
{14969}{15068}Shark is enciphered on a machine with a fourth|rotor specially developed for U-boats...
{15072}{15187}which gives it about 4, 000 million|billion different starting positions.
{15226}{15296}And, uh, we've never seen one.
{15300}{15379}Holy shit!
{15383}{15448}I haven't understood a word.
{15452}{15528}Can somebody give me a straight answer|to a straight question?
{15532}{15642}- Will this blackout definitely be over in--|- Nobody can say definitely, sir.
{15646}{15687}Yes or no?
{15787}{15891}- No.|- Thank you.
{15895}{16021}So it isn't over in four days.|When will it be over, hmm?
{16025}{16073}Hmm? Hmm? You.
{16134}{16247}Well, all I have to measure it by is how long|it took last time when Shark first came in.
{16251}{16330}- And how long did it take?|- Ten months.
{16372}{16438}Well, this is a great day|for Adolf Hitler.
{16442}{16495}Ten months?
{16499}{16565}But you did break it?
{16569}{16611}Yes.
{16615}{16705}- How?|- I'm afraid I can't tell you that.
{16884}{16931}I think it's time we--
{16935}{17010}I think it's time|I got back to London.
{17380}{17485}It's not just a million tons of shipping.|It's a million tons of shipping every week!
{17489}{17578}It's our capability to supply Russia,|to support the army in North Africa...
{17582}{17636}to invade Europe|and drive the Germans out.
{17640}{17723}- It's the whole fucking war.|- Sir.
{17903}{18037}Satisfied? Now, send the stupid bugger|back to where he came from.
{18172}{18222}Don't waste a match.
{18308}{18354}Back to Mayfair?
{18358}{18404}No.
{18434}{18498}How many people knew|about the German weather code...
{18501}{18554}how important it was to us?
{18558}{18611}A dozen, maybe. Why?
{18615}{18671}Make me a little list?
{18708}{18762}What are you doing here,|Mr Wigram?
{18766}{18834}You think there's a spy|in Bletchley Park?
{18933}{19021}I'm Cave.|Naval Intelligence.
{19025}{19128}I'll be liaising with the admiralty.|They've given me an office in your hut.
{19198}{19259}I'm ultra-cleared.
{19263}{19346}- What does that mean?|- That means I know how you broke Shark, in principle.
{19350}{19427}You used a captured copy|of the German Navy's weather code book.
{19431}{19515}Gave you a pretty good idea of what their|weather signals were supposed to be saying.
{19519}{19565}Can I see it?
{19611}{19693}Midnight, two days ago,|the Germans changed to a new book.
{19697}{19832}- So we lost that crib.|- Well, why do you think they did that just then?
{19836}{19898}Don't know.
{19902}{19949}And the other one?
{19953}{20011}Short signal code book.
{20015}{20105}The U-boats employ it for reporting|their position, course and speed.
{20109}{20191}Unfortunately, if you don't know where|the U-boat is or what it's doing...
{20195}{20272}the short signal code book|isn't much help as a crib.
{20415}{20474}Two men died|saving those little books...
{20478}{20551}from a sinking submarine.
{20555}{20609}Fasson and Grazier.
{20651}{20732}We caught the U-boat|on the surface in the eastern Med.
{20813}{20922}The sub went down when they were inside|trying to bring out its four-rotor Enigma.
{21002}{21082}November '42.|I was in destroyers.
{21086}{21153}It was my last ship.
{21197}{21291}Bletchley is the lucky number|in this war.
{21297}{21362}- One and six, please.|- One and six.
{21507}{21568}Here you are.
{21747}{21796}Girls, guess I'm off.
{21800}{21864}- See you later.|- Yes, I'll see you later.
{22117}{22182}Miss Wallace?
{22186}{22259}Mr Jericho.|When did you get back?
{22263}{22365}Just today.|How, uh-- How are you?
{22402}{22447}How am I?
{22451}{22530}Yeah, all right.|How is she?
{22534}{22608}She's-- She's Claire.
{22667}{22747}- Well, will you tell her?|- If I see her.
{22751}{22824}She hasn't been sleeping|at home the last two nights.
{22862}{22923}Sorry.
{23153}{23214}Good morning, sir.
{23453}{23529}- Worrying about your babies?|- Puck.
{23533}{23606}Thomas.
{23656}{23720}So, they say you’re|not crazy any more.
{23808}{23860}- It thinks it's found a possible.|- "It thinks"?
{23864}{23947}- Why not?|- Been in the hut?
{23951}{24020}- Come on. Get it over with.|- No, I'm fine, Puck.
{24024}{24070}Sure, you are.
{24107}{24163}Hey, Betty, wait for me!
{24219}{24286}Gentlemen, we have a ghost.
{24290}{24336}Tom, how the hell are you?
{24340}{24389}- Well. Very well.|- Have you escaped, or what?
{24393}{24445}- I thought this was the asylum.|- How are you?
{24449}{24499}- Good.|- Bloody hell!
{24503}{24572}- How's the revolution, Alec?|- Coming along, comrade. Coming along.
{24576}{24653}- T-- T-- T--|- Yes, it's me.
{24657}{24724}I, uh-- I want to see all the Shark|traffic we haven't been able to break.
{24831}{24881}- In at the deep end.|- Why not?
{24885}{24958}- Yes, why not?|- Have you got yesterday's Porpoises?
{24962}{25027}Open the file.
{25031}{25131}Besides, it wasn't really Shark|that made you crazy.
{25135}{25189}Was it, Tom?
{25228}{25289}I suppose you all know.
{25293}{25378}You think I made a fool of myself?
{25382}{25433}Forget about it.|You're among friends.
{25530}{25584}So, what about the code breakers?
{25588}{25713}King come, De Brooke,|Upjohn, Pukowski.
{25717}{25822}- Spot the odd one out.|- Puck lost his parents when Poland was invaded.
{25826}{25922}His kid brother is missing in action.|He hates the Germans.
{25926}{26012}Pinker?|Bit of an arty, isn't he?
{26016}{26067}He writes detective stories.
{26071}{26147}Baxter. They say he sleeps with|a picture of Stalin under his pillow.
{26151}{26202}Perhaps you haven't heard.|Stalin's on our side now.
{26206}{26302}- And Jericho. The famous Mr Jericho.|- Mathematician.
{26306}{26423}Went off his trolley, didn't he?|About some girl.
{26427}{26492}We took him out of Cambridge|on the first day of the war.
{26496}{26608}He worked himself into a breakdown, so we|shipped him back to Cambridge to get well.
{26612}{26674}And that's all there is to it.
{26678}{26757}It's never all there is|to anything.
{26812}{26880}Shift's not over yet, ladies!
{26884}{26970}The 3:00's from Beaumanor|all need blisting.
{27087}{27185}You know, without your glasses,|you don't look half bad.
{27189}{27270}Do you know, without my glasses,|nor do you?
{29187}{29247}Claire?
{29251}{29304}I'm here.
{29334}{29387}Sorry it took an age.
{29391}{29440}Well, now you know where I am.
{29444}{29541}It's, um, off the beaten track.
{29545}{29611}Yes, well, it's better|than being snooped on by landladies.
{29615}{29679}Welfare found out I had a spare room,|so I had to share.
{29682}{29782}But Hester's a sweetie, really. Oh, there's|no sugar, I'm afraid, but it's lapsang.
{29786}{29871}And I always think sugar would|rather spoil lapsang, don’t you?
{29875}{29963}Don't know.|You're my first lapsang.
{30001}{30075}I knew you’d ask me out.
{30079}{30207}- I thought you asked me out.|- Well, I had to get you started. Aren't there any pretty girls in Hut 8?
{30210}{30314}- How do you know where I work?|- We've got an interesting men tracking room in Hut 3.
{30318}{30401}- You're not supposed to tell me where you--|- Besides, you're rumoured to have done something very clever...
{30405}{30467}and I want to know what it is.
{30471}{30538}Oh, my God.|Where did they find you?
{30542}{30618}Oh, where did they find any of us?|I'm the lucky one.
{30622}{30702}You know, they've got perfectly clever|girls working like post office clerks.
{30706}{30783}Not like me|on the German book.
{30787}{30834}I want that for my scrapbook.
{30915}{30992}- Can I see it?|- If you want. It's upstairs.
{31072}{31119}That's Hester.
{31199}{31257}And this is me.
{31487}{31546}You've been busy.
{31550}{31678}- Where is this?|- Loch Feochan, in Scotland, where I'd like to be old.
{31682}{31776}If I'm ever old.|Do you think it's beautiful?
{32842}{32938}Why are you a mathematician?|Do you like sums?
{32979}{33044}I like numbers.
{33048}{33146}Because with numbers,|truth and beauty are the same thing.
{33150}{33250}You know you’re getting somewhere|when the equations start looking...
{33254}{33322}beautiful.
{33326}{33427}And you know the numbers are taking you|closer to the secret of how things are.
{33480}{33568}A rose is just plain text.
{35794}{35884}My God.|What have you done?
{35888}{35941}What has she done?
{35945}{36013}- Mr Jericho?|- Miss Wallace.
{36017}{36115}I came looking for Claire.|I was worried about her.
{36147}{36202}I could fill a bus with men|who are worried about Claire Romilly...
{36206}{36267}but that's no reason why|I shouldn't go to the police.
{36271}{36355}She'd be the first person|they'd arrest.
{36420}{36478}Miss Wallace,|please put that poker down.
{36482}{36566}And if you know where she is,|for God's sake, tell me.
{36674}{36722}She's gone missing.
{36773}{36819}What are those, exactly?
{36865}{36936}Intercepts. German signals.
{36940}{37007}Yes, I know that much.
{37011}{37104}Five- letter groups. German Navy signals|are sent in four-letter groups.
{37108}{37174}So this must be army|or Luftwaffe.
{37178}{37224}Picked up by the radio scanners|at Beaumanor.
{37228}{37356}All sent between 9:30 and midnight|on April 17, nine days ago.
{37359}{37463}- But never deciphered.|- How do you know that?
{37467}{37558}Well, if it'd gone through the machine,|then plain text would be stuck on the back.
{37562}{37648}All from the same source.|"ADU. ADU. "
{37652}{37729}Does the call sign ADU|mean anything to you, Miss Wallace?
{37787}{37838}Miss Wallace?
{37895}{37941}"Angels Dance Upwards. "
{37945}{37991}- What?|- Well, that's how we'd reference it.
{37995}{38090}- Who is it? Who is ADU?|- I don't know.
{38094}{38170}But you could find out.
{38174}{38255}Do you have any idea|what you’re saying?
{38259}{38374}We can't just go digging through Bletchley looking|for information about missing cryptograms.
{38378}{38475}Ifwewant to find Claire, then we need|to find out what she was hiding.
{38524}{38591}- You think Claire is a traitor.|- Would it matter if she were?
{38624}{38688}Of course it matters.|Look...
{38691}{38784}she was probably flirting with an officer|and forgot to file those intercepts...
{38788}{38849}so she hid them|rather than get told off.
{38853}{38922}Or she stole them|and then she ran away.
{38969}{39018}You really are mad,|aren't you?
{39022}{39143}And I would have to be even madder to have any|part in this little amateur sleuthing adventure.
{39147}{39224}Miss Wallace.|Miss Wallace!
{39228}{39294}You said yourself|that she was missing.
{39298}{39400}Now, is that normal?|Is that her habit?
{39404}{39515}Well, she does always come home|to change her clothes.
{39519}{39572}Well, there you are.
{39650}{39715}Is she seeing anyone,|do you know?
{39750}{39809}What exactly is your interest here?
{39850}{39939}You can reach me at Armstrong's|Guest House in Albion Street.
{40055}{40108}ADU, Miss Wallace.
{40112}{40181}Angels Dance Upwards.
{40363}{40431}They call it Black Bottom|the new twister
{40435}{40484}It's sure got 'em|and, oh, sister
{40488}{40594}They clap their hands|and do a raggedy flop and a hop
{40598}{40649}Old fellows with lumbago
{40653}{40704}And high yellow|The waves they go
{40708}{40790}They jump right in|and give us all that they've got
{40794}{40908}They say that when that river bottom's|covered with ooze
{41024}{41099}You silly, silly girl.
{41269}{41318}These people keep|such funny hours.
{41322}{41405}I haven't heard--|Oh, Mr Jericho!
{41409}{41511}You have a visitor.|You can have the parlour.
{41565}{41633}We don't have guests|in the bedrooms after 10:00.
{41637}{41701}Oh, Mrs Armstrong, it's perfectly|sweet of you to worry...
{41705}{41774}but I don't mind taking|the risk just this once.
{41778}{41893}Well, I suppose it's all right|if you’re from the park.
{41983}{42089}Mr Wigram, would you care|for a cup of Ovaltine?
{42093}{42137}Ovaltine?
{42141}{42203}I haven't had Ovaltine since--|no, no--
{42207}{42282}Ovaltine. Thank you.|I don't think my system could take it.
{42331}{42375}What a charming house.
{42379}{42490}And hunting prints.|Do you hunt?
{42722}{42786}Where are you based?|Here?
{42889}{42935}Bliss.
{42980}{43048}What can I do for you,|Mr, um, Wigram?
{43052}{43140}There's something|I've been wondering about.
{43144}{43209}You're the man|who broke the U-boat code.
{43213}{43286}Hmm?|Champagne all around.
{43290}{43381}Happy days are here again,|all right?
{43385}{43439}Then you fell out of your pram.
{43478}{43525}So what happened?
{43529}{43578}It was personal.
{43582}{43634}I can keep a secret.
{43730}{43785}Wonderful thing about war--
{43825}{43899}Peacetime is about keeping|the people in their place.
{43903}{44019}But then war breaks out,|and life was never so glorious.
{44063}{44132}The toiling masses|turn into heroes...
{44136}{44217}and their little women start dropping|their drawers like debutantes.
{44221}{44306}- Well, if that’s all you--|- And best of all, the swots.
{44310}{44401}Dragged out in a cloud of dandruff|from some dim backwater...
{44405}{44470}and invited to the ball.
{44474}{44584}At Bletchley, you're as glamorous|as fighter pilots.
{44588}{44640}Girls you couldn't even hope to meet|go weak at the knees...
{44644}{44725}at the thought of the size|of your brain, isn't that right?
{44729}{44802}If talking through your arse|is what they teach you in spy school--
{44806}{44881}I'm talking about you|and a girl called Claire Romilly.
{44915}{44961}|We're rather worried about her.
{44965}{45093}Officially been missing for 14 hours, give or take.|When in fact, it's more like 48 hours.
{45097}{45178}She hasn't been seen|since she went off-duty on Thursday.
{45236}{45326}Rather a good friend|of yours, I gather.
{45364}{45430}I- I haven't seen her since befo--|since before I--
{45434}{45509}Quite.|Heard from her?
{45540}{45626}- No.|- Apart from the postcard.
{45671}{45729}Let's try to remember everything.
{45733}{45790}It saves misunderstandings.
{45898}{45989}Did you go to the cottage tonight?|Don't think about it.
{45993}{46036}- Yes.|- Yes.
{46065}{46112}Yes.
{46178}{46238}Mind if I sit down?
{46242}{46327}I've been away for a month.|I wanted to look her up.
{46331}{46410}You ever discuss|your work with her?
{46414}{46528}- Of course not.|- Um, how about a gun?
{46532}{46585}- Any guns?|- A gun?
{46589}{46667}A gun from that museum of yours...
{46671}{46771}liberated from a captured U-boat along with the code|books, the captain's teddy bear and what have you.
{46775}{46861}All very improper and unsigned for,|but I turned a blind eye.
{46865}{46951}But no reason why you should know,|a chap like you.
{47044}{47105}Mind if I check the coat?
{47593}{47676}While we're at it--
{47932}{47987}- You sure you don't mind?|- I'm beginning to.
{48103}{48150}You see my point, though,|don’t you?
{48154}{48250}One day the Germans black us out|in the North Atlantic.
{48254}{48335}Next day, girlfriend|of crack code breaker disappears--
{48339}{48396}vanishes.
{48400}{48505}- Code breaker returns, shiny new shooter goes missing.|- She's not my girlfriend.
{48509}{48589}Hmm? What is she, then?
{48593}{48672}We were-- I suppose the phrase is|"seeing each other"...
{48676}{48732}for about a month.
{48778}{48843}Is that what happened to you?
{48847}{48893}What?
{48897}{48986}Is Claire Romilly|what happened to you?
{49212}{49266}There was a concert.
{49319}{49376}I went on my own.
{49958}{50025}Oh, it’s you.|You found my slipper.
{50124}{50232}Afterwards, Claire, Hester--|Miss Wallace, who shares the cottage--
{50236}{50302}and I, we came out together.
{50306}{50355}Next week was going to be Bach.
{50359}{50405}Oh, we must go.
{50409}{50473}Oh, I can't.|I'm on the night shift.
{50476}{50525}Oh, Hester. Poor you.
{50529}{50607}"Poor you, " she said.|That's one of her phrases.
{50611}{50677}So, I asked her.
{50681}{50788}I say, I hope you don't think it|fresh of me, but should we go together?
{50792}{50933}Of course you did.|And, uh, after that?
{50937}{51001}After that?
{51004}{51076}I had the happiest month|of my whole life.
{51080}{51145}Not happiest. Something.
{51268}{51340}- You can! You can.|- I can't.
{51344}{51415}You can. Yes.
{51419}{51517}Ready? One, two, three,|four, five, six, seven, eight.
{51555}{51653}- Sorry.|- No, you can't.
{51657}{51711}- Claire!|- Aaron!
{51715}{51764}- May I?|- Do you mind?
{51768}{51832}No.
{52158}{52204}It's my favorite club.
{52208}{52306}- Mine too.|- Oh, yes, I'm sure.
{52310}{52372}How do you get the petrol coupons to go|zipping up and down to London?
{52376}{52468}Secret, darling.|I know a chap.
{52472}{52551}- No, but how?|- It's not what you think.
{52555}{52601}Do you have to know everything?
{52605}{52678}I don't know why you want me.|Let's get married before it stops.
{52682}{52776}- Tom, don't.|- I love you!
{52780}{52846}They say you shouldn't fall in love|in a war. You never know what's coming.
{52892}{52993}I love you.|I really love you.
{53448}{53504}No cottage.
{53508}{53573}- Is that code, darling?|- Yes.
{53577}{53655}- I want to see where you sleep.|- Landlady has rules.
{53659}{53733}So have I.|Hester's at home.
{53737}{53783}Oh.
{53787}{53861}I'll be quiet as a mouse.|Promise.
{53932}{53978}Shh. Shh.
{54268}{54332}Sleep with her?
{54360}{54417}I'll take that as a yes.
{54458}{54515}And then you quarreled?
{54519}{54601}Quarreled? No.
{54660}{54729}Claire? Darling?
{54800}{54866}Sorry, darling.
{54870}{54916}Go back to sleep.
{54954}{55071}- What are you doing?|- I'm just looking through your things.
{55075}{55141}No photographs?
{55145}{55206}You've never given me|a photograph.
{55340}{55394}You're all secrets,|aren’t you?
{55398}{55459}I've no secrets from you.|Please come back to bed.
{55607}{55736}What's this? What's the|entscheidungs problem when it's at home?
{55740}{55793}That's just something|I was working on at Cambridge.
{55797}{55862}It's a-- It's a theoretical|machine that--
{55866}{55975}- Theoretical. So it doesn't exist?|- Please, come back to bed.
{55979}{56072}Well, this will do.|I want something of yours to keep.
{56076}{56124}Give it back.
{56128}{56233}- Why?|- Because it means nothing|to you and a lot to me.
{56237}{56314}- Aren't I clever enough, darling?|- Please, Claire!
{56318}{56387}No!
{56391}{56442}Give it back.|Give it back.
{56674}{56726}It's not funny, Claire!
{57004}{57066}Claire, I'm sorry.|Please forgive me.
{57070}{57137}I'm really, really sorry.
{57171}{57213}Claire--
{57217}{57282}She moved on.
{57286}{57356}Why won’t you answer my letters?
{57409}{57533}Are you seeing someone else?
{57537}{57606}I'm always seeing someone else.
{57682}{57731}Yes.
{57762}{57826}She moved on.
{57859}{57914}Not right, Mr Jericho.
{57967}{58021}Can't quite put my finger on it...
{58025}{58128}but definitely not right.
{58310}{58391}Were you surprised when they told you|that Admiral Doenitz...
{58395}{58446}had changed the German Navy|weather code?
{58450}{58514}Any bells go off?
{58517}{58565}Germans were always nervous|about Enigma.
{58569}{58641}Well, the Germans are supposed to think|that Enigma's an unbreakable system...
{58645}{58721}because it would take thousands of years|to go through every setting...
{58725}{58806}to find the one that turns|the code back into the plain text.
{58810}{58912}Next day, it's different again. Using|human beings, Enigma is safe forever...
{58916}{58990}but we don't use|human beings for that.
{59050}{59089}Do we...
{59093}{59163}Mr Jericho?
{59167}{59235}- No.|- No.
{59239}{59301}And that is the secret|inside the secret.
{59305}{59383}All they know thus far is that the weather|code opened a crack in the system...
{59387}{59456}because somebody told them.
{59509}{59621}But what if somebody tells them|just how we do do it?
{59625}{59737}Your thinking machine.|Clackety- clack, day and night.
{59741}{59811}Programmed with a menu,|thanks to your big brain...
{59815}{59877}that reduces the odds|to just a few million to one...
{59881}{59936}till it locks on to|the winning combination.
{59988}{60040}There goes thewar.
{60149}{60210}Oh.
{60214}{60283}I've got a little list.
{60287}{60340}You're on it.
{60344}{60448}Communists, foreign nationals...
{60452}{60519}geniuses just this side|of barking mad.
{60523}{60571}Altogether, a security nightmare.
{60575}{60681}But of all these names, Mr Jericho,|you are the only one...
{60685}{60820}who got himself fucked into|a nervous breakdown by a missing blonde.
{60824}{60885}You live quietly from now on.
{61060}{61122}Where does one pee around here?
{61126}{61182}To the right.
{62025}{62097}Good night, Mrs Armstrong.
{62426}{62511}Talk to me!|What do you want to know?
{62540}{62601}Do you want to know about Shark?|Do you want to know about Shark?
{62605}{62693}Any secret. Ask me.|Ask me! I'll tell you!
{62697}{62792}Poor you. I really got|under your skin, didn't I?
{63063}{63109}Good morning.
{63113}{63164}- Good morning.|- You look tired, sir.
{63168}{63214}Morning!
{63412}{63450}- Have you heard the latest?|- No.
{63454}{63532}Utility knickers--|one Yank, and they're off.
{63536}{63588}Naughty, naughty.
{63677}{63795}- Came through the door for you.|- If there is some other way
{63799}{63865}To prove that I love you
{63869}{63981}I swear I don't know how
{64156}{64237}Preserve my body and soul|into everlasting peace.
{64241}{64345}Take and eat this in remembrance|that Christ died for you.
{64349}{64407}Thank you for your note.
{64411}{64520}I take it it's about Claire.|Have you heard anything?
{64524}{64588}She hasn't turned up,|if that's what you mean.
{64591}{64681}- But you’ve got something.|- Take this and eat this in remembrance that Christ died for you.
{64685}{64734}I don't know why I'm doing this.
{64826}{64907}The body of our Lord,|Jesus Christ, which was given freely.
{64911}{64957}Preserve my body and soul--
{64961}{65085}ADU is the call sign|of Nachtrichten, Regiment 537...
{65089}{65153}a motorized German|Army signals unit based...
{65156}{65208}in the Ukraine.
{65420}{65534}Its messages are encoded in the standard|cipher for the Russian campaign.
{65538}{65635}- We call it Kestrel.|- Kestrel.
{65936}{65987}Seven messages|with the call sign ADU...
{65991}{66055}were intercepted|in March and April...
{66058}{66169}not counting the last four|on April the 17th, which you found.
{66173}{66270}I've written down the dates|and times of interception.
{66471}{66574}A spy doesn't steal the enemy's signals.|And anyway, they were never de--
{66578}{66674}They were never decoded. Why would|she steal four messages she can't read?
{66678}{66729}She must have stolen them|to read them.
{66733}{66807}She stole them to read them.|But there's no way she could have.
{66811}{66885}- Why not?|- She couldn't. It just--
{66889}{66955}Just take my word for it.
{66959}{67044}God preserve me.|Another one.
{67048}{67120}I seem to move, Mr Jericho,|in an endless round...
{67124}{67195}from one patronizing male|to another...
{67199}{67271}forever being told what I am|and what I am not allowed to know.
{67275}{67324}Well, that ends here.
{67380}{67436}So, what would she need|to read them?
{67440}{67517}I'm sorry.|You can't ask me that.
{67521}{67607}But you can ask me to sneak into the Index|Room and risk getting hung up by my thumbs.
{67723}{67795}- Good morning.|- Cheerio, then.
{67799}{67858}Oh, Chr-- Miss Wallace.
{67888}{67952}Miss Wallace!
{67955}{68025}She'd need--|She'd need a Typex machine.
{68075}{68147}Every day, our Typex machines|have to be set...
{68151}{68202}the same way the Germans|set their Enigmas.
{68206}{68283}Otherwise, you just get|nonsense from nonsense.
{68316}{68392}And working out each day's settings|is the hard part.
{68396}{68457}That's where|the code breakers come in.
{68461}{68584}- How?|- Well, you-- you need a crib.
{68588}{68658}- I'll see you later, then.|- Suppose that gravestone was in code.
{68662}{68757}If I knew who was buried here, more|or less, I'd know what the code meant.
{68804}{68850}That's a crib.
{68854}{68937}And when you've set the machine,|you type in the coded message.
{68941}{69007}If it comes out nonsense,|the settings are wrong.
{69011}{69063}If it comes out|"Mary Jane Hawkins"...
{69067}{69113}you've broken Enigma for that day.
{69166}{69257}Why would Claire get hold of the|Kestrel settings for April the 17th?
{69261}{69335}She couldn't have,|unless she had help.
{69339}{69426}Kestrel would be filed in Hut 6.
{69430}{69483}It’s your hut.
{69522}{69587}So now I'm a traitor too.
{69591}{69715}Well, maybe she got access|to one of the Typex machines from you.
{69719}{69798}Typex girls work around the clock.
{69802}{69840}Sorry.
{69879}{69925}Stuck.
{69963}{70024}Look.
{70028}{70105}The first seven ADUs were decoded.
{70109}{70168}Now, what happens|to decoded messages?
{70172}{70262}They get written into the German book.|That's Claire's job.
{70266}{70313}Then what?
{70317}{70391}Well, then they get filed with|everything else in the main registry.
{70395}{70489}- Ever been in there?|- Once or twice to check some--
{70493}{70571}No. No, no, no, no.
{70672}{70748}Oh, dear, would you like some tea?
{70792}{70838}- Reference or loan?|- Reference.
{70878}{70936}- Section?|- Hut 6. Control.
{71026}{71106}- What are they?|- Kestrel intercepts, March and April.
{71314}{71420}- He's been a dark horse, hasn't he?|- Hmm. Surprise a minute.
{71424}{71488}But there are complications.
{71491}{71548}Sorry to have been so long.
{71552}{71613}I've never come across this before.
{71659}{71729}- The file was empty?|- There was a typewritten note...
{71733}{71773}dated April the 17th...
{71777}{71841}referring all inquiries|to the Office of the Director General.
{71845}{71952}And that night, four final ADU|messages got in under the wire...
{71956}{72017}never deciphered, never filed...
{72021}{72076}taken home by Claire and hidden.
{72080}{72137}Who is the Director General?
{72184}{72245}Chief of the Special|Intelligence Service.
{72249}{72339}And he gets his orders straight|from the prime minister.
{72381}{72428}We're stuck again.
{72432}{72502}Maybe. Maybe not.
{72579}{72662}I've got the hang|of this detective work.
{72666}{72740}But I've been told|that everything's okay
{72854}{72908}You're out of bounds!
{72962}{73028}- Mr Mermagen.|- What are you doing?
{73085}{73138}Can you help me?
{73142}{73222}Machine Room needs the Kestrel settings|for the last couple of weeks.
{73226}{73314}They've found a batch of intercepts|fallen behind a desk.
{73318}{73408}- They've done what?|- I know.
{73412}{73515}But please don't tell.|It was actually a friend of mine.
{73552}{73633}Ah, you girls.
{73786}{73888}You know, I should really|report you for this...
{73892}{73934}but--
{73977}{74053}One good turn|deserves another, hmm?
{74057}{74151}Why, Mr Mermagen.
{74190}{74295}What will your wife say?
{74299}{74403}The Kestrel settings|for the whole of March and April.
{74407}{74451}Christ.
{74455}{74556}So, at least there's still a chance we can|read the ones you found in Claire's bedroom.
{74560}{74608}- I've burnt them.|- You what?
{74612}{74662}Hello, Tom.|Mind if we join you?
{74666}{74761}- You can't m-m-m-mean it.|- Well, of course I mean it.
{74765}{74857}Drowning herself was Virginia Woolf's greatest|contribution to English literature.
{74861}{74949}- Actually, we were just leaving.|- Waste not, want not.
{74953}{74999}Whale meat.|Brain food, Tom.
{75003}{75114}- You burned them!|- I had a close call with that lounge lizard Wigram from Special Intelligence.
{75118}{75213}I panicked. But the worst of it is,|I could have read them.
{75217}{75273}- How?|- I didn't need a Typex machine.
{75277}{75339}We've got a real Enigma|in the museum.
{75343}{75453}- Well, when did you find that out?|- Well, I knew. I just-- I just forgot.
{75457}{75517}You forgot?
{75521}{75588}And you're the genius.
{75679}{75753}You know, I won a newspaper|crossword competition.
{75757}{75864}I beat two men. All three of us|were recruited for Bletchley.
{75868}{75918}They're cryptanalysts now.
{75922}{75987}And I'm a glorified file clerk.
{75991}{76095}'Course, if I'd been a daddy's girl|from some posh finishing school--
{76099}{76184}God, look, it's time|to go back on shift.
{76188}{76253}- You?|- Not for a bit.
{76290}{76338}Right.
{76342}{76407}Did she ever say anything about me?
{76488}{76534}Well, she must like you.
{76593}{76659}The way she talks about the others--
{76663}{76717}A bus load, you said?
{76752}{76808}The Romilly effect.
{76812}{76926}One look, and they're "Romillied. "
{76930}{77018}Who was she seeing?|I only mean it might be a way forward.
{77022}{77109}- I know what you think about me.|- No, you don't.
{77158}{77202}Well, I feel like an idiot.
{77206}{77318}And you aren't the one standing here with|the Kestrel settings stuffed into your knickers.
{77402}{77481}Look, I don't know|who she was seeing...
{77485}{77598}and I really think|we'd better call this a day.
{77602}{77648}Don’t you?
{77779}{77843}Bye, then.
{77877}{77930}Miss Wallace.
{78000}{78062}I haven't been lookin'|to the right or left...
{78066}{78189}so there's something|I didn't see clearly.
{78193}{78264}What's that?
{78268}{78322}That you’re a remarkable--
{78388}{78448}I think you’re simply wonderful.
{78765}{78859}Tom, nice of you to turn up.
{78863}{78954}- Look, I don't known what Skynner's been saying.|- Shut the door.
{79063}{79116}He wants you out.
{79120}{79210}"Send him back to Cambridge,|and this time make the bugger walk. "
{79214}{79266}I got you the rail pass.
{79270}{79344}- Not now!|- No, you can't do that, Guy. Tell them|you want to give me a couple of days.
{79348}{79409}- Why?|- To see if I can find a way back into Shark.
{79413}{79482}Tom, it was you that announced|that it couldn't be done in four days.
{79486}{79546}It was you that made Skynner look|a fool in front of his clients.
{79550}{79656}Now you want me to go back and|tell him-- Piss off, for God's sake!
{79660}{79767}Sorry, Guy. Hello, Thomas.|You'd better come and hear this.
{79771}{79829}Two long signals from U-boat|headquarters in the last 12 hours.
{79833}{79907}One just before midnight,|one just after. Rebroadcast twice.
{79911}{80010}- Then nothing. U-boat fleet is on radio silence.|- Christ.
{80014}{80097}They're on battle stations.
{80101}{80178}Say 12 U-boats 20 miles apart...
{80182}{80237}possibly two lines,|possibly three.
{80241}{80333}An ambush covering|hundreds of miles of ocean.
{80337}{80414}And this time,|we don't know where.
{80418}{80499}And one golden rule--|absolute radio silence.
{80503}{80565}- And wh-- wh--|- What then?
{80569}{80707}Either the convoy is lucky and misses|the ambush, or it isn't lucky.
{80711}{80801}And the first U-boat to make contact|with the convoy breaks radio silence.
{80805}{80885}- How?|- Minimally, using the short signal book.
{80889}{80957}It compresses the necessary information|to a few letters--
{80961}{81027}sighting of convoy,|position, course and speed.
{81031}{81116}That's repeated every two hours. As it's|picked up by the other U-boats in the line...
{81120}{81205}they start to converge on the convoy|and send a contact signal in their turn.
{81209}{81271}Contact signal.
{81275}{81364}They'll shadow the convoy till nightfall.|They prefer to attack in the dark.
{81406}{81522}We haven't got as much time as we'd thought.|I'd say, a day, a day and a half at the outside.
{81603}{81726}- Mary Jane Hawkins.|- The oracle has spoken.
{81730}{81844}They changed the weather code, but they|didn't change the short signal code book.
{81848}{81940}It's our way back into Shark,|so long as the U-boats find our convoy.
{82002}{82048}Don’t you see?|It's our convoy.
{82052}{82123}We know what the U-boats are sending.|It's the crib that we've been looking for.
{82127}{82194}- Would you get enough material?|- How many signals do you need?
{82198}{82268}One group of letters|for the convoy sighted...
{82272}{82338}two groups for grid reference, one group|for course, one group for speed.
{82342}{82410}Five groups of letters|per contact signal every two hours.
{82414}{82506}Shadowing the convoy for maybe 10 hours,|12-- that's 25 groups of letters.
{82510}{82570}And how many U-boats joining in?|Eight, ten?
{82574}{82663}Each one a contact signal|every two hours.
{82667}{82750}My God, he's right.|He's found us a crib.
{82754}{82869}- Brilliant.|- A-A-Appalling.
{82873}{82959}We've never had an operation on this scale. The contact|signals could easily build up to give us a crib...
{82963}{83051}of 100 group of letters and we've got|the short signal code book in the museum.
{83055}{83116}He's right, Guy.
{83150}{83204}Where are the keys to the museum?
{83208}{83314}Good Christ, Tom. We have to protect|the convoys, not sacrifice them.
{83318}{83393}You know what it's like out there.
{83397}{83454}The success of this plan|depends on arranging a massacre.
{83458}{83539}No. No, we are not arranging anything.|What happens is going to happen.
{83543}{83618}But if we can use it to our advantage,|we'll be able to decipher every signal...
{83622}{83690}sent by every U-boat|on the high seas for 24 hours!
{83694}{83759}- Including the weather reports.|- Yeah. We'll have the plain text.
{83763}{83810}We can make a start on reconstructing|the new weather code.
{83814}{83914}- This puts us back in the fight.|- And there will be many more convoys to protect.
{84127}{84173}You're back in business,|old thing.
{84950}{85024}Garbled text from Beaumanor.|Somebody get on the blower.
{85028}{85111}Miss Chamberlain, would you?|Get them to check their file copy.
{85244}{85337}Pam, does Beaumanor keep copies|of everything they send us?
{85341}{85420}- Yes. It's all there on file.|- Thank you.
{85424}{85495}Hello. Could I have Beaumanor 392?
{85538}{85602}Miss Wallace!
{85922}{85978}No female visitors upstairs.|That's the rule!
{86043}{86111}Mr Jericho, wake up.|It's not over.
{86115}{86182}- We need to borrow your Enigma machine.|- Didn’t you hear?
{86804}{86896}Top copy goes straight to|your people by teleprinter...
{86900}{86979}or by dispatch rider,|depending on priority.
{86983}{87079}The second copy we keep,|in case of garbles.
{87083}{87139}Can we see?
{87143}{87229}Well, if you want.|There's not much to it.
{87233}{87329}It's a treat for us, you know, a visit|from head office to the country cousins.
{87333}{87390}It's good of you to say so,|but, um...
{87394}{87488}a fat lot of use we'd be|without your intercepts, Major.
{87544}{87639}We keep them a couple of months,|filed chronologically.
{87727}{87848}These sets are tuned to the|Eastern Front-- Kestrel, Buzzard, Kite.
{87852}{87923}- And you're intercepting everything?|- Absolutely.
{87927}{87994}Except that time|the other week, of course.
{87998}{88038}Kestrel, wasn't it?
{88042}{88179}Yes, your Miles Mermagen came|on the blower in a frightful panic.
{88183}{88254}"No more ADU, thank you very much.|Not now, not ever. "
{88258}{88322}- What's that about?|- Orders from above.
{88326}{88404}We'd just sent him|four good, clean signals.
{88408}{88475}It was Kay here who handled|our mystery station.
{88479}{88516}Carry on.
{88520}{88621}Yeah, he has a good fist, ADU.|Touch like a concert pianist.
{88625}{88681}He's still transmitting?
{88685}{88791}Of course, I don't take him down any|more, but he was awful busy last week.
{88795}{88826}Oh, excuse me, sir.
{88924}{88994}What was it you said|you did again, Mr--
{88998}{89044}- Jericho.|- Jericho.
{89048}{89135}Can't say, I'm afraid.|Catch you up.
{89234}{89343}- Major, how many machines did you say you have here?|- We have 48 here.
{90303}{90359}Excuse me.
{90474}{90540}He's on now,|if you’re interested, sir.
{91466}{91526}Thank you.
{91530}{91604}I don't mean|to bother you, sir...
{91608}{91659}but it is important,|isn't it?
{91663}{91759}I know I shouldn't ask.|I mean, no one ever tells us.
{91763}{91820}You are making sense of it?|It is important?
{91824}{91870}Yes.
{91874}{91969}This is our only war, you see,|in here-- beep, beep, bloody beep.
{91973}{92030}And it's always nonsense,|nonsense, nonsense.
{92034}{92117}Yes, we are|making sense of it...
{92121}{92187}and it is important.
{92272}{92351}Eleven ADU signals|and launchings.
{92475}{92561}That's the car.|Man, woman, two-seater roadster.
{92871}{92917}Invite him to stop, shall we?
{93426}{93466}Take him, man! Take him!
{94078}{94150}Mr Jericho, stop! Stop! Stop!
{94178}{94218}Look out!
{94492}{94559}Shit.
{94598}{94686}Bravo, Mr Jericho.
{94690}{94754}Reckon, given the circumstances,|Miss Wallace...
{94757}{94808}we might now risk|first names.
{94870}{94934}Hester.
{94937}{94983}Tom.
{95073}{95163}This might be good.|It looks deserted enough.
{95167}{95213}Well spotted.
{95482}{95522}Bliss.
{95592}{95657}- What would they do to us if they knew?|- Feed us to the dogs.
{95661}{95720}Charming.
{95853}{95912}Right.
{95916}{95993}March and April|Beaumanor log sheets...
{95997}{96069}and the intercepts|from March 28th...
{96073}{96202}April 3rd, April 9th,|15th, 16th, 17th...
{96206}{96304}and Kestrel settings--|last one first.
{96308}{96370}Might tell us|why Claire disappeared.
{96374}{96441}Right. April 17, rotor order.
{96445}{96501}3- 5-4.
{96505}{96588}3- 5-4.
{96653}{96731}R- X-O.
{96770}{96878}- Plug board settings.|- A-O-E-M.
{96992}{97050}The current passes|from the keyboard...
{97054}{97103}to the lamps by way|of the rotors and the plugs.
{97107}{97195}And every time you press a key,|it changes the path of the current.
{97199}{97311}Press the same key ten times, it comes out|ten different ways on the lamp board.
{97315}{97427}You never know which letters|will light up. Simply brilliant.
{97613}{97670}Message key X-A-T.
{97757}{97828}- Ready?|- Ready.

{98572}{98652}It's not right, is it?|This isn't German.
{98656}{98708}Keep going. Sometimes the operator|pads out with nonsense.
{99011}{99067}Keep going.
{99071}{99143}- Um, "K. "|- Zed.

{99454}{99546}Isn't German.|Come on, genius!
{99799}{99851}I'm sorry. It's double coded,|or the settings must be wrong.
{99855}{99894}It's all been for nothing.
{101009}{101056}I'm afraid I have to ask you|to hurry up.
{102295}{102346}Search the barn.
{102523}{102626}This is Mr Leveret.|Detective Inspector Leveret.
{102630}{102723}He wants to know what you've been up to.|But first things first.
{103143}{103191}You've been here before?
{103278}{103324}And you?
{103444}{103508}Line up in the street|and search the area.
{103571}{103618}Have a look at this, sir.|It's down there.
{103622}{103689}- Right, sir.|- There?
{103693}{103752}Drag the river.
{103971}{104093}Please talk to me! What do you want to|know? I'll tell you anything you want.
{104156}{104229}Give me your hand.
{104267}{104347}Do you wanna know about Shark?|Any secret. Ask me!
{104393}{104471}Come this way.
{104475}{104584}I've got something to show you.|Get your notebook out.
{104657}{104704}Miss Wallace first.
{104777}{104903}I am showing the witness|one ladies' coat, colour grey...
{104907}{104966}trimmed with black velvet.
{104970}{105066}Label: Hunters, Burlington Arcade.
{105100}{105237}- And the witness responded--|- Yes. It's hers.
{105270}{105301}Yes.
{105356}{105462}Next, one ladies' shoe...
{105466}{105523}black high heel.
{105527}{105584}Uh, heel snapped off.
{105641}{105682}And the witness responded--
{105716}{105787}Yes.
{105812}{105876}It's an old quarry.
{105879}{105937}They built the town|with what they dug out.
{105941}{106024}That makes sense,|making one hole out of another.
{106028}{106138}- How deep is it?|- Sixty, seventy foot in the middle.
{106213}{106259}Christ, we'll need a submarine.
{106389}{106451}I would very much like|to arrest you...
{106455}{106514}but we don't have a body.
{106566}{106642}It's a quarter to 8:00.|Mr Leveret will take you back.
{106646}{106706}I believe your day|is just beginning.
{106990}{107052}Chaps.
{107113}{107218}Easy, everyone.|Just stopped by to wish you luck.
{107222}{107318}I'm sure you’re all aware,|as I am, what's at stake here.
{107322}{107411}I don't think I'm exaggerating|when I say...
{107415}{107486}this could be one of|the decisive nights of the war.
{107490}{107554}- So shut up, then.|- A mighty battle.
{107557}{107606}Probably...
{107610}{107686}the greatest convoy battle|of all time is about to start.
{107690}{107777}Three hours ago,|convoys HX 229A...
{107781}{107852}229 and SC 122...
{107856}{107942}had entered the presumed|operational area...
{107946}{107989}of the U-boat packs.
{108023}{108084}Now, in our long island history...
{108088}{108169}we have picked up the gauntlet|more than a few times.
{108173}{108217}|Shakespeare coming up.
{108221}{108349}"Out of this nettle, danger,|may we pluck this flower, safety. "
{108442}{108520}So, gentlemen, go to it.
{109000}{109056}Come and dance.|Boop- boop
{109095}{109129}Come on. Come and dance.
{109161}{109217}- No, I can't.|- Yes, you can. It's easy.
{109264}{109333}- No, really, you do it.|- Right, left.
{109337}{109396}Left, left.
{109400}{109464}Ah! You're getting the hang of it.
{109916}{109967}C- Can someone remind me?
{109971}{110084}A- Are w-we hoping for the U-boats|to find the convoys, o-o-or not?
{110088}{110142}- Not.|- I am.
{110146}{110246}- Yes, well, you would, Baxter.|- Y-You'd sacrifice o-o-our--
{110250}{110341}Sacrifice a convoy|to get back into Shark? Of course.
{110345}{110436}How many men has Stalin had|to sacrifice so far? Five million?
{110440}{110496}It's called the greater good.
{110500}{110603}Spoken, of course,|by someone who doesn't happen to be|in the North Atlantic at the moment.
{110607}{110727}You can only fight your own war.|What do you think, Tom?
{110771}{110830}About what?
{111337}{111438}So, Claire,|what were you doing?
{111442}{111510}What were you hiding?
{112131}{112176}Right.
{112180}{112244}Start at the beginning.
{112276}{112353}Kestrel settings, March.
{112588}{112644}Atlantic time|is two hours behind.
{112648}{112701}It's still dark.
{113194}{113248}Here, mate,|I got a lighter.
{113252}{113300}Thanks.
{114975}{115046}"Urgent. "
{115050}{115106}Mary Jane Hawkins.

{120233}{120304}Skynner's offered a bottle of Scotch|to the first man to come up with a menu.

{121615}{121665}Well, why the hell not?
{121711}{121788}When I'm done, we'll be looking|for a needle in a haystack...
{121792}{121886}but if we stop now it'll be|a hundred thousand haystacks.
{121944}{121990}You know that.
{121994}{122102}Full moon.|Ten U-boats, somewhere.
{122106}{122206}Thirty- seven merchants, five escorts,|one of which has lost contact with the convoy.
{122210}{122289}No rescue ship|and no air cover.
{122293}{122344}Eighteen.
{122348}{122427}- Flower down, 2-6-8 degrees.|- It's what you might call a bitch.
{122891}{122943}- Twenty-three.|- Not enough.
{123613}{123677}- What have you got?|- I need one more link.
{123680}{123738}I can't see it.
{123810}{123881}Names. They're names.
{123885}{123952}- You?|- No.
{123956}{124037}Getting a very bad feeling now.
{124073}{124130}Polish names.
{124331}{124389}- There.|- Yes.
{124585}{124684}- Menu.|- Let's hope to God it works.
{124833}{124916}It's started. Bastards.
{125556}{125634}Don’t you have homes to go to?
{126145}{126215}- How's it going?|- Four hits so far.
{126219}{126276}Probably 300 men lost.
{126280}{126380}A Dutch cargo and a Norwegian freighter|went straight to the bottom.
{126384}{126452}And an American liberty ship's|on fire.
{126456}{126539}Half the crew are drowning.|The other half are trying to save them.
{126636}{126733}Tom. Unfinished business.
{126794}{126856}Congratulations.
{126860}{126924}It's a half bottle,|as it turns out.
{126953}{127014}Typical Skynner.
{127018}{127082}That should go back.
{127086}{127134}Where's the museum key?
{127138}{127199}Oh, sorry, Guy.|I've still got it.
{127203}{127286}Tsk, tsk.|Security around here.
{127290}{127362}Then get off home, old thing.
{127366}{127445}- Haven't you got a girl waiting for you?|- She's dead.
{128660}{128708}Tom.
{128760}{128842}Oh, my God. Come on.
{128846}{128910}- What?|- Come on.
{128913}{128956}It's Polish.
{128960}{129006}Polish names, all of them.
{129010}{129084}The Germans|found a mass grave.
{129088}{129185}Look, doesn't it say|4, 000 corpses?
{129231}{129352}"Polish officers buried|in the forest at Katyn in 1940...
{129356}{129427}"during the Soviet occupation.
{129431}{129482}Shot in the back of the head. "
{129486}{129539}Murdered by the Russians.
{129543}{129604}By our Russian allies.
{129608}{129677}They were comrades-in-arms|against the Nazis.
{129681}{129754}My God.
{129758}{129840}That's why the file was empty--|on the orders of Secret Intelligence.
{129844}{129963}And that's why Beaumanor was ordered|to stop intercepting the signals.
{129967}{130015}It was too big a secret.
{130019}{130103}Just knowing that|can get you killed.
{130107}{130197}And Claire discovered it.
{130201}{130270}Copied it into the German book,|and she had to tell...
{130274}{130334}someone.
{130480}{130541}- Adam Pukowski.|- What?
{130545}{130585}Missing in action.
{130589}{130659}Kid brother of Jozef Pukowski.
{130663}{130700}Claire stole those intercepts|for Puck...
{130704}{130786}because he was looking|for his brother's name.
{130790}{130864}- Puck!|- Wait! Please!
{130868}{130936}This Puck killed her. Why?
{130940}{131059}Because he had a secret, too,|and she could've given him away.
{131063}{131116}- What secret?|- I can't tell you that!
{131120}{131163}Tom!
{131722}{131817}Hello. Could you get me|London Adelphi 4-2-4-3, please?
{131821}{131885}I'm sorry. That number|is not in service.
{131985}{132084}What the hell is this about, you and|some skirt waltzing around Beaumanor?
{132088}{132172}Leonard, unless you're asking me|to dance, let go of my arm!
{132176}{132280}I should've cooked your goose when you made|a fool of yourself over that blonde...
{132373}{132423}who fucked half the park.
{132427}{132470}What?
{133713}{133786}Stand away! Stand away!
{133927}{133975}What the bloody hell|do you think you’re doing?
{134044}{134113}He's two carriages up.|Snug as a bug in a rug.
{134148}{134180}Morning, sir.
{134503}{134547}You knew?
{134551}{134607}About Pukowski?
{134611}{134685}We had no proof,|but when Miss Romilly went missing--
{134689}{134796}- Puck and Claire were having an--|- Were seeing each other, as you like to put it.
{134800}{134853}Seeing each other's|brains out.
{134857}{134937}Jozef Pukowski, who'd been wondering|what could have happened...
{134941}{135028}to all those Polish officers who hadn't been|heard from since the first year of the war...
{135032}{135078}and Claire Romilly...
{135082}{135189}who was reading the Wermacht traffic|from the Eastern Front.
{135193}{135264}They were made for each other.
{135268}{135339}And lo, mass graves.
{135343}{135417}Polish uniforms, names.
{135421}{135523}- We've been bracing ourselves for the Nazi propaganda.|- Propaganda?
{135565}{135651}Four thousand Poles|murdered by Stalin?
{135655}{135726}It's what Hitler would|give his last ball for.
{135730}{135831}Think of all those Polish names|in the U. S. of A.
{135835}{135927}Think of our convoys|full of American goods...
{135931}{135979}some of them|in American ships...
{135983}{136079}running the U-boat gauntlet so our|supplies can keep Stalin in business.
{136083}{136151}- But it's true, isn't it?|- The Katyn massacre?
{136155}{136281}Oh, really, do shut up. There's a war|to win, and Stalin's helping us win it.
{136285}{136318}And they hate|the Russians, you know.
{136322}{136381}They've hated them|for centuries.
{136385}{136444}So what's Pukowski|going to do to get back at them?
{136448}{136514}Help the enemy. That's what.
{136518}{136598}His enemy's enemy.
{136602}{136713}And he's got a big piece of knowledge|that can help the Germans-- Shark.
{136717}{136814}- The weather code.|- Claire couldn't have known what he'd do. She wasn't a traitor.
{136818}{136874}I'm sure you’re right.
{136878}{136960}But then Pukowski heard|that you were coming back.
{136964}{137078}Jericho, the lover who wouldn't let go,|who'd cracked once before.
{137082}{137166}The swot who was invited to the ball,|found Cinderella's slipper...
{137170}{137216}and went so crazy|he would've told her anything.
{137220}{137321}And you would have, wouldn’t you?|About how we lost Shark.
{137325}{137393}And the rumour that there was a mole|in the park, probably in your hut.
{137397}{137507}How long would it have taken Claire to work out|that the traitor was Puck? About a minute.
{137511}{137557}So he killed her.
{137679}{137748}One- way to Manchester,|according to the ticket collector.
{137752}{137801}Change the watch.
{137865}{137986}Well, let's see where|and to whom he will lead us, hmm?
{138220}{138275}Train approaching, platform three.
{138279}{138369}It's the 3:15 to Manchester.
{138440}{138507}How do you get the petrol coupons|to go zipping up and down to London?
{138511}{138618}Secret, darling. I know a chap.
{138704}{138825}Train standing, platform three.|3:15 for Manchester only.
{139319}{139390}Manchester, next stop.
{139394}{139449}That's it for you.
{139488}{139560}Go home, keep your head down...
{139564}{139635}and I might try and forget about you and|your moll breaking the Highway Code...
{139639}{139692}and the Official Secrets Act|on the same day.
{139717}{139769}Train standing, platform three.
{139773}{139863}3:15 to Manchester only.
{139867}{139995}You've been trying to frighten me into keeping|my head down right from the start. Why?
{139999}{140071}Because somehow|I frighten you. Why?
{140075}{140169}Because of Claire.|My connection with Claire.
{140203}{140249}Be careful now.
{140364}{140436}The night you came to my room, you|already had Pukowski in your sights...
{140440}{140506}yet you went out of your way|to play the heavy with me.
{140510}{140581}And then you were more concerned about|Claire Romilly than you were about Shark.
{140585}{140663}- A girl who'd missed her shift? Why?|- Why? She was his girlfriend.
{140667}{140750}Oh, no. She was more than that.
{140754}{140851}She was working for you.|Claire was your agent.
{140855}{140950}She told you everything,|even how I found her shoe.
{141054}{141162}As you said, Bletchley was a security nightmare,|so you put a girl in the park to do your dirty work.
{141166}{141215}Surely you mean|her patriotic duty.
{141219}{141322}Everything that she did, she did because|you told her. You had her fucking for England.
{141385}{141457}And then when she got to Pukowski,|it went wrong. She took pity on him...
{141461}{141520}and she told him what she was|writing in the German book.
{141573}{141622}No wonder you were frightened.
{141626}{141743}You'd made a terrible mistake, and your|agent paid for it with her life. Claire.
{141781}{141827}He's jumped!
{141972}{142014}He's gone!
{142115}{142205}Come on! Back it up!|Back the train up!
{142412}{142463}What are they doing?
{142880}{143011}Sir, please. The station's clear.|Roadblocks are in place.
{143015}{143103}- Search the train again.|- He's not on the train!
{143107}{143185}- We'll have to let it go.|- Please be patient.
{143745}{143845}Oh, Puck, there's a message left for you|at the switchboard. It's Adelphi 4-2-4-3.
{144085}{144135}- Keep the change.|- Thank you very much.
{144139}{144198}- To the station, rather fast, please.|- Ma'am.
{146120}{146193}You bloody idiot.|This time I can't save you.
{146197}{146243}You broke Skynner's cheekbone.
{146298}{146368}Tom. Well, weather code is,|uh, c-c-cracking open.
{146372}{146433}Where's Puck?
{146518}{146565}- Check our weather report--|- How bad is it?
{146569}{146618}It's bad.
{146622}{146701}But we are reading Shark,|thanks to you lot.
{146775}{146887}- What's this?|- Grid square A-M-2-9. We think it's a garbled signal.
{146891}{146955}- Signal to a U-boat?|- Mmm. U-617.
{146959}{147041}Ordered out of battle|to proceed immedi--
{147045}{147078}Yes?
{147082}{147125}Where is this?
{147129}{147251}Loch Feochan, in Scotland, where|I'd like to be old. If I'm ever old.
{147255}{147376}So, it's the real thing.|U- 671, rendezvous in 24 hours.
{147380}{147461}Our turn to find a sitting duck.
{147465}{147501}My God.
{148255}{148301}- Be careful.|- I will.
{149798}{149828}Damn it.
{150303}{150365}- I'm on the chosen frequency.|- Sir.
{150369}{150461}- There's probably interference.|- Swing around. I'll fine-tune it.
{150465}{150511}Perfect.
{150515}{150586}Just in time to bugger up|the whole operation.
{150963}{151057}- Do you want to abort?|- Are you serious?
{151738}{151837}- I didn't kill her.|- I know.
{151841}{151905}Do you think|I'm here for that?
{152008}{152102}- That's right, my darling.|- They're ready.
{152106}{152179}Up you come.
{152183}{152229}What about the rest of it?
{152233}{152317}The real secret you want to tell the Germans,|about how we really broke the code?
{152321}{152417}- About my machines!|- Thomas, Thomas.
{152421}{152475}- You can have your enemy. Let me have mine.|- No.
{152479}{152530}Well, shoot me, then.
{152534}{152625}- It's your show, but your man--|- He is not my man.
{152629}{152679}Serve it up.
{152742}{152837}- Go ahead.|- Tell Auntie Mae the package is ready.
{153241}{153278}Dinner's ready.
{154026}{154051}Bulls eye!
{155121}{155235}- Run out a couple of yards there.|- You're looking in the wrong place.
{155264}{155315}Oh, it's Mr Jericho.
{155393}{155449}Come home again|with his batteries dried out.
{155453}{155506}You turned out to be|some swot.
{155510}{155645}- I tip my hat to you.|- She's not there. Didn’t you hear me?
{155649}{155727}She's moved on.
{155783}{155869}The murder scene was like|a pile of clothes left on a beach.
{155873}{155929}Sometimes it means|somebody's dead.
{155933}{156004}Sometimes it means|somebody wanted to disappear.
{156008}{156079}Like an agent who'd been|turned by her target.
{156083}{156154}It was you|who saw it before I did.
{156158}{156207}What makes you think that?
{156211}{156283}Pukowski was on the train,|and you were letting him run.
{156287}{156408}He knew the secret that could lose us|the war. Remember? The thinking machine.
{156412}{156480}You were holding back to see|who he would lead you to.
{156484}{156566}Who the hell could it be|to make you take that risk?
{156570}{156612}Only Claire.
{156616}{156672}Well, I was wrong, wasn't I?
{156676}{156726}She wasn't with Pukowski.
{156730}{156841}She was waiting for him up the line to take|him to her little Scottish hideaway...
{156845}{156922}where a couple of runaway lovers|could sit out the rest of the war.
{156926}{156995}Do you think I didn't check?
{156999}{157097}She loved him, and Pukowski brought her|all the way to the brink...
{157101}{157155}but then he had to tell her|what she didn't know...
{157159}{157251}about the U-boat|coming to pick him up, and why.
{157255}{157307}If they got caught,|they'd both hang.
{157311}{157418}But there was no going back.|Only forward, to Germany.
{157422}{157472}But then,|he didn't know Claire.
{157476}{157540}She was no traitor.
{157581}{157650}She's out there, somewhere...
{157654}{157742}like a sword|hanging over your head.
{157771}{157820}In different ways,|she fooled us all.
{157824}{157900}She was unreadable.
{157951}{158085}- Stick to sums.|- I think I've got something! Easy does it!
{158089}{158151}What have you got there?
{158155}{158197}Steady.
{158201}{158267}- We're losing her, lads.|- Do you want it to be her?
{158271}{158327}Steady, now.
{158359}{158452}False alarm!
{158456}{158526}Shut up.
{158530}{158589}Keep looking.
{158620}{158680}Oh, I will.
{158684}{158739}I will.
{160905}{160979}- Sorry I'm late.|- It's all right.
{160983}{161077}I was getting worried|about you two.
