00:00:59,827 --> 00:01:02,476
Based on a true story.

4
00:01:03,476 --> 00:01:08,484
Enmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay were the
first mountaineers to reach the summit of Everest.

5
00:01:08,584 --> 00:01:13,479
Over the next 40 years. Professional, expert
mountaineers tried to accomplish the same feat.

6
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:16,382
One in four died

7
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:20,296
1992:
New Zealander, Rob Hall created the concept of guided
commercial expeditions to Everest for amateur mountaineers.

8
00:01:20,475 --> 00:01:24,177
During the next 4 years, his team, "Adventure Consultants"
successfully guided 19 clients to the summit,

9
00:01:24,256 --> 00:01:26,766
without a single death.

10
00:01:27,117 --> 00:01:32,253
1996:
Other commercial operators follow the example of Rob Hall,
including "Mountain Madness", by Scott Fischer.

11
00:01:32,432 --> 00:01:37,544
Completing over 20 expeditions to reach the summit
of Everest in the same period of 2 weeks

12
00:01:38,828 --> 00:01:40,524
Please listen up.

13
00:01:41,305 --> 00:01:42,922
Guys.

14
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,941
We got 2000 feet,

15
00:01:45,966 --> 00:01:48,097
600 vertical metres (m)

16
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,234
to Camp 4.

17
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:52,467
Let's rope all the way,

18
00:01:52,492 --> 00:01:54,605
so I know you can make it.

19
00:01:54,832 --> 00:01:57,951
Alright, once we get to the
Yellow band, we're going to regroup.

20
00:01:57,976 --> 00:02:00,784
Put on the mask,
turn on the gas.

21
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,628
Make sense?

22
00:02:54,434 --> 00:02:56,409
$325 a bottle,

23
00:02:56,434 --> 00:02:57,343
- for oxygen.
(6 weeks ago...)

24
00:02:57,367 --> 00:02:59,427
- It's daylight robbery.
(6 weeks ago...)

25
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,474
Yeah. Well, he's corner the market,
he's got it

26
00:03:01,499 --> 00:03:04,631
He reckon there's going to be
20 teams at Base camp this season.

27
00:03:04,656 --> 00:03:07,034
- 20 teams?
- I mean with all the Sherpas and porters

28
00:03:07,059 --> 00:03:09,423
it's going to be
squeeze up there.

29
00:03:09,961 --> 00:03:12,729
Lets...
scrum on the ropes right there.

30
00:03:12,754 --> 00:03:13,846
What is this?

31
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:14,994
It's Helen's.

32
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:16,896
It's a little decoration
for the mess in.

33
00:03:16,921 --> 00:03:19,173
- Hey, you can wear them on your head, y'hear.
- I'll have it, thank you.

34
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,481
Okay, I got some news.

35
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:22,981
- We got Krakauer.
- Huh?

36
00:03:23,006 --> 00:03:24,088
Oh, yeah!

37
00:03:24,113 --> 00:03:26,626
- You stole him from Scott Fischer.
- No, he made his own mind.

38
00:03:26,651 --> 00:03:28,503
Good job, Rob.

39
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:31,527
How much is he paying you, Rob?

40
00:03:31,552 --> 00:03:34,001
Well, he's...
only paying for his airfare.

41
00:03:34,026 --> 00:03:35,914
but we got 5000 words

42
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:38,888
in the magazine and our picture
in the front cover.  Huh.

43
00:03:38,937 --> 00:03:41,555
That makes it all worthwhile.
Right there.

44
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,024
Or if you get him to the top.

45
00:03:43,058 --> 00:03:46,017
If... If...
How can you say that to me?

46
00:03:46,042 --> 00:03:47,459
Here you go, I got you.
You alright?

47
00:03:47,484 --> 00:03:48,879
Thanks, Guy.
Cheers, mate.

48
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:51,160
- Hey.
- Hi, Rob.

49
00:03:52,022 --> 00:03:53,972
- You alright?
- Oh, yeah. How are you?

50
00:03:53,997 --> 00:03:56,726
- I am good. Oh, look at you.
- I know.

51
00:03:56,751 --> 00:03:58,471
- Big.
- Here you go.

52
00:03:58,496 --> 00:03:59,459
You good?

53
00:03:59,508 --> 00:04:00,644
- Yeh, you know.
- Okay.

54
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:02,329
Just going to miss you.

55
00:04:05,424 --> 00:04:07,232
Let's go, Guy.

56
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,638
Just-Just go careful, alright?

57
00:04:10,663 --> 00:04:12,531
- It's just...
- Please don't.

58
00:04:12,556 --> 00:04:14,662
Come on, please don't worry.

59
00:04:14,692 --> 00:04:17,357
It's just that doing nothing back here
that's making me worry.

60
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,073
- You're not doing nothing.
- No, but...

61
00:04:20,287 --> 00:04:21,714
What?

62
00:04:22,008 --> 00:04:24,413
It's the waiting for you.

63
00:04:24,438 --> 00:04:26,635
- For him.
- Ha ha.

64
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,726
- Her.
- Her.

65
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:34,308
Just, be back for the birth,
Rob Hall.

66
00:04:35,035 --> 00:04:37,377
You try and stop me.

67
00:04:41,454 --> 00:04:44,074
- Okay, I love you.
- Go, or I'll cry.

68
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:45,738
Go.

69
00:05:04,133 --> 00:05:06,638
KATHMANDU, NEPAL

70
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,679
30th March 1996

71
00:05:09,704 --> 00:05:11,204
Here.

72
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:13,955
- That all you got.
- Yeah. That's it.

73
00:05:14,253 --> 00:05:16,274
I think we're over here.

74
00:05:24,528 --> 00:05:27,133
Hey...
What work outfit you guys with?

75
00:05:27,158 --> 00:05:29,745
- Adventure Consultants.
- Uh, good, me too.

76
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,362
I'm Beck.
Beck Weathers.

77
00:05:31,387 --> 00:05:32,850
Doug Hansen.

78
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,657
- Jon Krakauer.
- How're you doing?

79
00:05:34,682 --> 00:05:36,068
- Okay.
- Are you...

80
00:05:36,093 --> 00:05:38,272
Krakauer from Outside magazine.

81
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:39,960
- Yeah.
- Really?

82
00:05:39,985 --> 00:05:42,151
What're you doing?
Writing or climbing or what?

83
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:44,115
A little bit of both.

84
00:05:44,565 --> 00:05:47,243
Well. I'll let you know
how the Summit goes, okay?

85
00:05:47,268 --> 00:05:50,822
- No need, I'll be there.
- We'll see.

86
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,634
What do you do when
you're not climbing, Doug?

87
00:06:08,673 --> 00:06:10,530
- What? Work?
- Yeah.

88
00:06:10,555 --> 00:06:13,323
Uh, different things.
Carpenter, mailman.

89
00:06:13,348 --> 00:06:16,197
- Carpenter, mailman.
- Yep.

90
00:06:16,222 --> 00:06:20,237
- Seriously, you deliver the mail?
- Yep, I deliver the mail.

91
00:06:21,007 --> 00:06:23,270
Mailman on Everest?

92
00:06:23,295 --> 00:06:26,041
- Hope so.
- Ha ha. I like that.

93
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:28,102
Mailman on Everest.

94
00:06:35,925 --> 00:06:37,197
There we go.

95
00:06:37,222 --> 00:06:38,695
- There.
- Yeah.

96
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,016
You know, he made it to the
South Summit on Everest last year.

97
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,227
- Who? Doug did?
- Yeah.

98
00:06:43,252 --> 00:06:46,848
- That's pretty hot for a mailman.
- Yep

99
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,338
Brown's Peak,
McKinley.

100
00:06:49,385 --> 00:06:52,253
I never made it up to
the top of McKinley myself.

101
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:53,305
I know.

102
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,108
- How did you know that?
- 89', right?

103
00:06:56,133 --> 00:06:59,230
Ohhh.
You done your research.

104
00:06:59,255 --> 00:07:01,113
That's what we do.

105
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:12,282
You, my friends, are following
in some very famous footsteps.

106
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:14,500
A histroy made famous
by George Everest,

107
00:07:14,525 --> 00:07:17,545
George Mallory, Tenzing Norgay,
Edmund Hillary...

108
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,685
- And Rob Hall.
- lege...

109
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,715
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

110
00:07:20,771 --> 00:07:23,091
legend... lege...
legends, all of them.

111
00:07:23,116 --> 00:07:25,015
- Ha-ha-ha...
- Eh ha ha...

112
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,736
That's right.

113
00:07:27,088 --> 00:07:28,798
For those of you who dare
face the dreams,

114
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:33,515
Adventure Consultants offer something
beyond the power of words to describe.

115
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,326
And why don't we
describe it in the brochure.

116
00:07:37,676 --> 00:07:40,101
Because it's mostly just pain.

117
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,408
- Yes.
- Ain't that the truth.

118
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:43,165
And the odd,
if you don't mind, Mike.

119
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,003
And the odd missing toe.

120
00:07:46,686 --> 00:07:47,842
There we go.

121
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,193
- Oh...
- Uuu...

122
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,014
To put it simply, guys.

123
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,979
Human beings
simply aren't built to function

124
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:57,946
at the cruising altitude of a 747.

125
00:07:58,164 --> 00:08:01,560
Okay, once we get above here,
above the South Col.

126
00:08:01,585 --> 00:08:04,836
Our bodies will be literally dying
and I mean literally dying.

127
00:08:04,861 --> 00:08:07,016
It's not called the Death Zone
for nothing, guys.

128
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:10,474
So, the game is,
can we get you up to the top

129
00:08:10,499 --> 00:08:13,872
and down to the bottom
before that happens.

130
00:08:13,897 --> 00:08:16,469
- You sure can.
- Oh.

131
00:08:16,606 --> 00:08:17,933
Beck Weathers,
ladies and gentlemen.

132
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,048
You might've noticed he's a
bit of a lone star state.

133
00:08:20,073 --> 00:08:24,377
100% Texan right here, people.
100% Texan.

134
00:08:24,763 --> 00:08:26,773
You met Mike Groom.

135
00:08:27,104 --> 00:08:29,262
I like to introduce you to Andy Harris.
- Or Harold.

136
00:08:29,287 --> 00:08:30,844
Harold had got out of Queenstown.

137
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:32,903
Taranaki actually,
originally Canada.

138
00:08:32,936 --> 00:08:35,069
Helen and the rest of the team are
already on their way up to Base Camp.

139
00:08:35,094 --> 00:08:37,525
They're setting it up
when we get there.

140
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,412
- Today is March 30th, people.
- Yeah.

141
00:08:39,437 --> 00:08:41,632
I plan on going to
the Summit, May 10th.

142
00:08:41,657 --> 00:08:43,895
It's been a lucky day for me
in Adventure Consultants,

143
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,552
and the weather is usually
pretty stable around then.

144
00:08:46,577 --> 00:08:47,897
So that means,

145
00:08:47,922 --> 00:08:51,640
We have 40 days,
to train your bodies and your minds

146
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:52,867
to go for it.

147
00:08:52,891 --> 00:08:55,841
Now. I know there is a lot of
mountaineering experience in this room

148
00:08:55,865 --> 00:08:57,303
you wouldn't be here without it.

149
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:00,263
- Stu, K2, Broad Peak.
- Nice.

150
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:04,491
John Taske,
1192m of Mount Kosciuszko.

151
00:09:04,516 --> 00:09:05,657
- Ha ha ha...
- Eh ha ha...

152
00:09:05,682 --> 00:09:08,105
- And Yasuko Namba.
- Oh.

153
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,489
- 6 of the 7 Summits.
- Yeah.

154
00:09:09,514 --> 00:09:11,529
- An amazing woman.
- There you go.

155
00:09:11,554 --> 00:09:13,177
- Let's make it 7.
- Thank you.

156
00:09:13,202 --> 00:09:16,877
But, Everest though, is another beast.
Another beast altogether.

157
00:09:16,902 --> 00:09:18,751
That's why you're here.
Isn't that right, Dougy.

158
00:09:18,776 --> 00:09:21,838
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

159
00:09:21,863 --> 00:09:23,403
So, listen.
Tonight, that's it for me.

160
00:09:23,428 --> 00:09:27,033
Eat, drink, be merry.
Tomorrow we trek.

161
00:09:29,205 --> 00:09:31,351
Alright, let's go.

162
00:09:35,102 --> 00:09:36,962
Alright, folks, hang on.

163
00:09:36,987 --> 00:09:38,040
Okay.

164
00:09:38,065 --> 00:09:39,508
That's it.
Here we go, colonel

165
00:09:39,533 --> 00:09:41,306
Alright, everybody, earbuds.

166
00:09:41,338 --> 00:09:43,397
Take your seats.
Buckle in, everyone.

167
00:09:43,422 --> 00:09:44,996
Thanks, bud.

168
00:09:45,021 --> 00:09:47,331
Here we go.

169
00:10:13,481 --> 00:10:16,387
Lukla : 2,860 metres

170
00:10:25,575 --> 00:10:27,370
Take it easy.

171
00:10:28,538 --> 00:10:30,953
- Ready.
- Let's go.

172
00:10:30,978 --> 00:10:32,872
You lead the way.

173
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:35,774
- Are you alright?
- Come on, man.

174
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:10,392
Namche Bazzar : 3,750 metres

175
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:12,664
Guys, man want to see
your climbing permits.

176
00:11:12,689 --> 00:11:15,281
Need to see all
your climbing permits.

177
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,846
Thank you very much.
We'll see you on the way back.

178
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:20,554
Thank you very much.

179
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,851
- All good?
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you?

180
00:11:22,876 --> 00:11:25,131
- Yeah.
- Hey...

181
00:11:25,156 --> 00:11:26,783
Thanks, Rob.

182
00:11:27,265 --> 00:11:30,283
- Thanks for what?
- You know, the discount.

183
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,651
You're working 3 jobs, Doug.

184
00:11:33,676 --> 00:11:35,189
It's the least I can do, right?

185
00:11:35,214 --> 00:11:38,910
I know you didn't have to do it.
I appreciated it.

186
00:11:39,913 --> 00:11:41,478
Let's just get you
to the top this time.

187
00:11:41,503 --> 00:11:43,257
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

188
00:11:43,282 --> 00:11:44,906
Yeah.

189
00:11:53,648 --> 00:11:55,516
How're you feeling, Beck?

190
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,915
About a third to midland.

191
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,698
Come on, buddy.
You can do it.

192
00:11:59,723 --> 00:12:02,015
Thought I was going to
acclimatise faster than this.

193
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,035
Uh.
You'll be alright.

194
00:12:06,489 --> 00:12:08,263
Go on, critters

195
00:12:23,287 --> 00:12:25,027
Woo.

196
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:28,175
- Well.
- Yeah.

197
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,833
How close did you get?

198
00:12:34,858 --> 00:12:36,700
I got really close, 
but...

199
00:12:36,725 --> 00:12:40,097
got a lateness , 
pretty shot anyways, so...

200
00:12:41,013 --> 00:12:43,271
I think I would have
made a run for it.

201
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:46,131
- Everyday I wake up thinking that.
- Then why didn't you do it?

202
00:12:46,156 --> 00:12:48,299
Because I turned him around.

203
00:12:48,445 --> 00:12:50,108
1:15 (PM) of the South Summit.

204
00:12:50,142 --> 00:12:53,567
That condition, we weren't going to
make that 2 PM turn around.

205
00:12:53,918 --> 00:12:55,504
It's all good more you make
the top, Beck.

206
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:58,084
but you pay me
to bring you down safely.

207
00:12:58,109 --> 00:12:59,702
Remember that.

208
00:13:00,725 --> 00:13:02,353
Okay.

209
00:13:11,272 --> 00:13:12,938
What's eating him?

210
00:13:13,832 --> 00:13:16,563
One of those Sherpas is Tenzing.
He had an accident.

211
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:18,796
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah.

212
00:13:18,821 --> 00:13:21,123
... on the icefall.

213
00:13:21,148 --> 00:13:24,011
It's not good,
had to bring him down.

214
00:13:39,142 --> 00:13:43,303
Tengboche Monastery : 3,867 metres

215
00:13:56,214 --> 00:14:05,905
Blessing at Tengboche Monastery

216
00:14:16,138 --> 00:14:21,257
Climbers Memorial, Thok La : 4,877 metres

217
00:15:01,388 --> 00:15:04,818
South Base Camp Of Everest : 5,367 metres

218
00:15:06,418 --> 00:15:08,498
Look what happens.

219
00:15:08,525 --> 00:15:11,138
Yeah. Didn't take you too long
to get in on the act.

220
00:15:11,163 --> 00:15:13,426
Got to make a living, man.

221
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:17,509
You... went ahead and
fixed the ice post, I see.

222
00:15:17,534 --> 00:15:20,141
Yeah, yeah.
It's pretty messy up there this year.

223
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,685
- Yeah?
- The vasses are pretty big.

224
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,848
Strung 4 or 5 ladders across.

225
00:15:23,873 --> 00:15:25,969
You use good ropes there, did you?

226
00:15:26,795 --> 00:15:28,151
You ready?
Okay.

227
00:15:28,176 --> 00:15:31,605
This is April 7th about 10:30 am

228
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,557
This is Sandy Hill Pittman reporting
for Nbc Interactive Media

229
00:15:34,582 --> 00:15:38,447
and we are official at
Everest Base Camp.

230
00:15:38,472 --> 00:15:40,375
- She one of yours?
- Oh, yeah.

231
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,258
Someone went and stole my journalist
so I had to get another one.

232
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,061
She's a lot easier on the eye
than Jon Krakauer, that's for sure.

233
00:15:47,086 --> 00:15:48,858
Listen, just to be clear
I didn't steal your journalist.

234
00:15:48,883 --> 00:15:50,259
Hey, man.
It's all good.

235
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:52,445
- Outside magazine gave me a call...
- Hey.

236
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,971
- They gave me a call...
- Hey!

237
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:56,094
-  said they wanted...
- It's all good.

238
00:15:56,119 --> 00:15:57,717
they're going to sent
a journalist up the hill

239
00:15:57,742 --> 00:16:00,064
and asked me if
I was interested.

240
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:03,370
It was his call in the end.

241
00:16:13,538 --> 00:16:15,494
Alright.
Carol Mackenzie, team doctor.

242
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,095
Why don't you kick it off, Carol.

243
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,883
- Hi, everyone.
- Hey, Carol.

244
00:16:18,908 --> 00:16:20,367
Hi, there.

245
00:16:21,852 --> 00:16:24,295
- Hey, sorry.
- No, it's fine.

246
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,919
Um. So...
Rob and Harold and Mike

247
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,584
will tell you all sorts of stuff
about mountaineering.

248
00:16:29,609 --> 00:16:31,822
but, from a medical stand of point,

249
00:16:31,847 --> 00:16:35,274
getting into the top of Everest
was really about oxygen.

250
00:16:35,299 --> 00:16:36,902
and the lack of it.

251
00:16:36,927 --> 00:16:38,953
To give you the best chance
of summiting,

252
00:16:38,978 --> 00:16:42,297
you need to prepare your bodies
for the thin air up there.

253
00:16:42,322 --> 00:16:45,054
So, over the next month
before the final ascend,

254
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:47,987
you are going to make
3 partial acclimatising ascends,

255
00:16:48,012 --> 00:16:51,109
returning here, to Base Camp,
after each one.

256
00:16:51,134 --> 00:16:55,480
The bad news is that each ascend
begins and ends with the icefall.

257
00:16:55,505 --> 00:16:58,540
I'm sorry,
but there's no way around it.

258
00:16:58,744 --> 00:17:03,343
There're millions of tons of glacier ice
continue moving day and night.

259
00:17:05,446 --> 00:17:08,683
Your crevasses so deep
they probably don't have a bottom.

260
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:11,134
It is not a place that you want to
get caught hanging out on,

261
00:17:11,159 --> 00:17:13,021
especially when the sun hits it.

262
00:17:13,046 --> 00:17:16,568
So, we're going to be up, nice and early
and through that as soon as possible.

263
00:17:16,593 --> 00:17:19,179
Now, the Sherpas are going ahead and
fixed the ladders across the crevasses

264
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,835
and we've made it
as safe as we possibly can.

265
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,721
But, that is not to say
that it is completely safe.

266
00:17:24,746 --> 00:17:27,391
19 people have died
in that icefall.

267
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:30,935
- Whoa whoa whoa...
- Hold on.

268
00:17:31,663 --> 00:17:33,196
Steady.

269
00:17:33,442 --> 00:17:35,942
- You alright, Jon?
- You alright?

270
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:39,271
- I'm good. Okay.
- Alright, steady up.

271
00:17:39,296 --> 00:17:41,873
So, remember,
we're a team,

272
00:17:41,898 --> 00:17:43,833
let's look up for each other.

273
00:17:43,865 --> 00:17:46,560
 - Lookout for hypothermia.
(Camp 1 : 5,944 metres)

274
00:17:46,585 --> 00:17:50,363
Things like slur speech
and irrational behaviour.

275
00:17:50,388 --> 00:17:52,805
I've seen hypoxia climbers
ripped off all their clothes

276
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:55,984
at 8000 m because
they are feeling hot.

277
00:17:57,172 --> 00:18:00,151
You all know about cerebral edema,
the swelling of your brain

278
00:18:00,191 --> 00:18:04,386
to the point of lost of motor function
and eventually death.

279
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,202
And pulmonary edema, which is
your lungs filling with fluid.

280
00:18:08,227 --> 00:18:10,438
till you furtively drown.

281
00:18:10,463 --> 00:18:13,838
The only cure is to get
down the mountain fast.

282
00:18:13,863 --> 00:18:15,450
Alright. Okay.
Alright.

283
00:18:15,475 --> 00:18:17,931
But, it is not all doom
and gloom here, okay?

284
00:18:17,956 --> 00:18:21,622
Myself and the whole AC team are here
to make sure you get up and down safely

285
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:24,574
and you will acclimatise naturally.

286
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:27,511
So, why don't we all
give Carol a nice big thank you.

287
00:18:27,536 --> 00:18:29,068
- Oh, you don't have to give me that.
- It's her first time here.

288
00:18:29,093 --> 00:18:30,404
- Hey.
- Alright.

289
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:32,093
Nice job.

290
00:18:32,856 --> 00:18:36,317
23th April

291
00:18:39,088 --> 00:18:42,346
Camp 2 : 6,492 metres

292
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,178
Well done.

293
00:18:44,967 --> 00:18:48,344
You want to get on the regulator
or you want to hear that

294
00:18:49,898 --> 00:18:51,142
Can it get hosed.

295
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:52,642
Guys, go.

296
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,756
- How're you doing, darling?
- Okay.

297
00:18:54,781 --> 00:18:55,850
- Good?
- Yeah.

298
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,741
- Well done.
- Hang in there.

299
00:18:59,446 --> 00:19:02,044
In a situation like this,
you just want to catch your breath

300
00:19:02,069 --> 00:19:04,246
go right up to 4, you should
start feeling pretty good.

301
00:19:04,271 --> 00:19:05,453
Yeah, I can feel that already.

302
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:06,951
How did you boys go?

303
00:19:06,976 --> 00:19:08,534
- Instant happiness.
- Hey.

304
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,173
- Amazing.
- Very happy.

305
00:19:14,466 --> 00:19:16,580
- Doug, you okay?
- Huh?

306
00:19:16,605 --> 00:19:19,109
When we get back to base,
I want you to...

307
00:19:19,134 --> 00:19:20,349
get Carol to get
a look at you.

308
00:19:20,374 --> 00:19:21,630
Nah, I'm alright.
I'm okay.

309
00:19:21,655 --> 00:19:24,652
Then... do me a favor,
swinge another oxygen.

310
00:19:24,677 --> 00:19:25,998
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

311
00:19:26,023 --> 00:19:28,293
- You got enough?
- We got plenty.

312
00:19:28,318 --> 00:19:29,837
Alright.

313
00:19:31,032 --> 00:19:32,869
Get some tea in there.

314
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,590
Just lift your shirt up a bit.

315
00:19:35,615 --> 00:19:37,140
Thank you.

316
00:19:39,925 --> 00:19:42,276
Now, take a deep breath for me.

317
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,592
Just take one of those
in the morning

318
00:19:49,617 --> 00:19:52,718
- with a little bit of water before breakfast.
- Okay. thanks.

319
00:19:52,923 --> 00:19:54,385
- Right, Beck. You're up.
- It's alright.

320
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:56,307
You're right.
Go for it.

321
00:19:57,753 --> 00:19:59,562
Read it and weep.

322
00:19:59,974 --> 00:20:01,862
Take it easy there.

323
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:06,705
- Right, you can stop.
- Yeah?

324
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:09,247
- You're in great shape, Beck.
- I'm in great shape.

325
00:20:09,272 --> 00:20:11,341
- Yeah.
- 6 days a week in the gym

326
00:20:11,366 --> 00:20:13,601
- ought to do it.
- Your wife must have love that.

327
00:20:13,626 --> 00:20:15,599
Yeah, she does.

328
00:20:15,905 --> 00:20:18,382
Oh no.
What's the date today?

329
00:20:18,407 --> 00:20:20,889
- April 25th.
- No.

330
00:20:20,914 --> 00:20:22,774
No...

331
00:20:26,801 --> 00:20:29,629
Need to send a message to my wife.
Can I use your fax?

332
00:20:29,654 --> 00:20:33,000
You might want to look at this one first,
came in for you last night.

333
00:20:35,585 --> 00:20:37,667
Happy Anniversary Beck
- Peach.

334
00:20:37,692 --> 00:20:38,831
Oh, Lord.

335
00:20:38,856 --> 00:20:40,119
What?

336
00:20:41,149 --> 00:20:42,861
Can I-Can I use your satphone?

337
00:20:42,886 --> 00:20:46,430
Woo. This came in last night,
it is an emergency?

338
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:48,864
- It's...  25 bucks a minute, Beck.
- Yeah, fine.

339
00:20:48,891 --> 00:20:51,977
- No. This one is on us.
- Seriously.

340
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:53,540
Thanks.

341
00:20:54,914 --> 00:20:56,370
Rob.

342
00:20:57,617 --> 00:21:00,123
- Beck?
- Peach, it's me.

343
00:21:00,148 --> 00:21:01,651
What happened?

344
00:21:01,676 --> 00:21:03,777
Nothing. Nothing.
I'm fine.

345
00:21:03,802 --> 00:21:06,119
Where-Where are you?

346
00:21:06,653 --> 00:21:09,176
I'm at Base Camp right now.

347
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:11,195
You're calling me from Everest?

348
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,911
Yeah, it's a satellite phone, honey.

349
00:21:12,936 --> 00:21:15,114
Oh my god.
How much is that costing?

350
00:21:15,139 --> 00:21:18,858
- What's the problem?
- There is no problem, Peach.

351
00:21:19,765 --> 00:21:21,705
I'm sorry, we were
up at Camp 2 and

352
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:24,998
that's why I didn't send
you a fax yesterday.

353
00:21:26,194 --> 00:21:29,644
Happy anniversary.
Okay.

354
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:31,202
- Get off.
- Mom.

355
00:21:31,227 --> 00:21:33,825
- How're the kids?
- Fine.

356
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,312
- Hey.
- Peach.

357
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:37,572
- Get off.
- Bud's here.

358
00:21:38,198 --> 00:21:41,088
Doing his homework
in the morning as per usual.

359
00:21:41,113 --> 00:21:42,588
You want to say hi to him?

360
00:21:42,613 --> 00:21:43,898
Yeah, of course I do.

361
00:21:43,923 --> 00:21:45,069
- Hang on.
- Okay.

362
00:21:45,094 --> 00:21:46,129
- Say hi.
- Hey, Dad.

363
00:21:46,154 --> 00:21:47,353
- Hey, Bud.
- Hi.

364
00:21:47,378 --> 00:21:49,126
I miss you, buddy.

365
00:21:49,388 --> 00:21:51,776
Oh.
And Meg went on her first date.

366
00:21:51,801 --> 00:21:54,204
- Mom.
- ...last weekend. Well, you did.

367
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,911
- Wow. Really?
- Um-hum.

368
00:21:56,936 --> 00:21:58,938
- Get off.
- Peach.

369
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,366
I missed you, honey.

370
00:22:03,826 --> 00:22:05,611
Mom?
Mom.

371
00:22:05,636 --> 00:22:07,616
Missed the kids...

372
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:10,981
a lot.

373
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:16,480
- Peach.
- Listen, I got to get the kids to school.

374
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:18,701
I got to run.

375
00:22:20,161 --> 00:22:21,290
Okay.

376
00:22:21,315 --> 00:22:23,043
Yeah.
Go careful.

377
00:22:23,068 --> 00:22:24,790
Bye bye.

378
00:22:27,636 --> 00:22:29,652
Is Dad okay?

379
00:22:31,084 --> 00:22:32,842
Just... he never calls.

380
00:22:32,867 --> 00:22:34,320
He's...

381
00:22:34,592 --> 00:22:36,815
I think he's scared.

00:22:47,981 --> 00:22:49,101
Yeah.

385
00:22:49,126 --> 00:22:51,410
Beck.
Come in mate, come on.

386
00:22:51,999 --> 00:22:54,600
- Come on.
- Come on, Beck.

387
00:22:55,451 --> 00:22:57,889
You don't dance.
You don't climb.

388
00:22:57,914 --> 00:22:59,568
Come on, guys.
Beck Weathers.

389
00:22:59,614 --> 00:23:01,704
- Yeah.
- Come on, Beck. Come on.

390
00:23:01,729 --> 00:23:06,598

Hey, man.
Breaking into the rations?

394
00:23:17,294 --> 00:23:18,617
Yeah, you want some?

395
00:23:18,642 --> 00:23:21,705
No. I'll...
I'll wait till we summit.

396
00:23:22,723 --> 00:23:25,272
I don't know about that, Neal.

397
00:23:25,903 --> 00:23:27,784
We'll get there.

398
00:23:27,891 --> 00:23:29,177
I'm excited.

399
00:23:29,202 --> 00:23:33,016
Anyway, me and Anatoli are here
to help you, you know.

400
00:23:34,815 --> 00:23:37,695
It's too much competition.

401
00:23:40,473 --> 00:23:44,038
We don't need competition
 between people.

402
00:23:46,664 --> 00:23:51,805
This competition,
between every person and this mountain.

403
00:23:53,542 --> 00:23:58,292
The last word always
belongs to the mountain.

404
00:24:11,147 --> 00:24:14,457
Lhotse Face : 7,132 metres

405
00:24:22,368 --> 00:24:24,301
- Ang Dorjee.
- Yeah!

406
00:24:24,326 --> 00:24:26,973
Stay there, Beck.
Stay there.

407
00:24:27,121 --> 00:24:29,364
Okay, I'm coming down.

408
00:24:35,647 --> 00:24:37,959
This isn't happening, guys.

409
00:24:38,738 --> 00:24:40,699
Let's turn him around.

410
00:24:41,308 --> 00:24:43,399
Get him off the Face,
and back to the Base Camp

411
00:24:43,424 --> 00:24:44,581
Turn around.

412
00:24:44,606 --> 00:24:47,511
- Ang Dorjee. Come on, we're going down.
- Okay.

413
00:24:52,747 --> 00:24:54,412
My hand!

414
00:24:55,858 --> 00:24:58,817
Okay, make a fist again.
Just kind of keep clenching

415
00:24:58,842 --> 00:25:00,752
to keep the blood flow.

416
00:25:03,475 --> 00:25:05,125
What's going on, man?

417
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:07,534
Still waiting for the south Africans.

418
00:25:07,818 --> 00:25:10,387
 Carl took forever as well.

419
00:25:11,938 --> 00:25:14,665
Hey, Ian.
You haven't paid for these ladders.

420
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:17,757
Yeah, yeah.
Your yak fun money is coming.

421
00:25:18,542 --> 00:25:21,632
- You serious man?
- Come on. Get a move on.

422
00:25:27,765 --> 00:25:30,271
- How long you're been waiting him?
- A good 45 minutes.

423
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:32,625
- Man, it's freezing.
- Yeah.

424
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:34,688
- Stinging, huh?
- Yeah.

425
00:25:34,713 --> 00:25:37,722
- Hey, Rob, we got to get him over!
- We're working on it.

426
00:25:37,747 --> 00:25:39,717
He's freezing, man.

427
00:25:40,825 --> 00:25:42,691
- Are you set?
- Yeah.

428
00:25:42,716 --> 00:25:45,536
- We're sending him over, mate.
- Go ahead.

429
00:25:52,263 --> 00:25:54,075
Keep going, Beck.

430
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,833
Looking good.

431
00:26:02,742 --> 00:26:06,099
- That's it.
- Now, head up, mate. Head up.

432
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:24,743
Hold on there!

433
00:26:24,785 --> 00:26:26,033
- Whoaaaa.
- Pull. Pull.

434
00:26:26,058 --> 00:26:28,582
Help. Help!
Help!

435
00:26:28,607 --> 00:26:30,547
Beck, you alright?

436
00:26:30,572 --> 00:26:32,181
- Are these ladders going to take 2.
- Yeah.

437
00:26:32,206 --> 00:26:33,721
I'll get a rope.
I'll belay you, okay!

438
00:26:33,746 --> 00:26:36,229
- Stay right where you are, mate.
- I can't pull yourself up!

439
00:26:36,254 --> 00:26:38,593
I'm going to come after you.

440
00:26:38,757 --> 00:26:41,256
Good-Good, Beck.
You're okay.

441
00:26:41,706 --> 00:26:43,072
Untie these, 
you got to tie me in.

442
00:26:43,097 --> 00:26:44,199
Come and get me.

443
00:26:44,224 --> 00:26:45,618
- On belay.
- Got it, on belay.

444
00:26:45,643 --> 00:26:46,953
Let's go.

445
00:26:46,978 --> 00:26:49,984
I'm coming after you, Beck.
Here I come, mate.

446
00:26:55,388 --> 00:26:57,816
Nice and easy,

447
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:01,425
- I can't feel my hands!
- Looking good.

448
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,457
Help me.

449
00:27:02,482 --> 00:27:03,528
- Beck. Beck. Beck.
- Help me!

450
00:27:03,553 --> 00:27:05,077
Stay right where you are, mate.

451
00:27:05,102 --> 00:27:06,435
- Can't pull myself up.
- I'm right here. I'm here.

452
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,364
I can't pull myself up!

453
00:27:18,794 --> 00:27:20,468
You okay?

454
00:27:21,085 --> 00:27:23,888
No guarantees to the Summit.
I get it.

455
00:27:23,913 --> 00:27:28,245
I get killed because I'm waiting in line.
Like I'm in a freaking Wal-mart.

456
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:31,578
Not while I paid you $65,000

457
00:27:31,603 --> 00:27:34,029
Now get me off of here.

458
00:27:35,033 --> 00:27:38,658
That's it.
Plant your feet, one at a time.

459
00:27:44,754 --> 00:27:46,930
Alright, thanks for coming by.
(Meeting for guides, organizers)

460
00:27:46,955 --> 00:27:50,162
Look. Base Camp as you know
is chalked up all this year, so...

461
00:27:50,187 --> 00:27:52,390
I think it'll
all benefit us greatly

462
00:27:52,415 --> 00:27:54,189
by coming together like this
and you know,

463
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:56,176
working out some kind
of plan and schedule.

464
00:27:56,201 --> 00:27:58,789
- What, like some kind of rotor?
- Yes.

465
00:27:58,814 --> 00:28:00,517
On Everest.

466
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:05,147
Everyone knows Everest is a business for you,
but, Rob, are you kidding?

467
00:28:05,172 --> 00:28:07,765
What gives you the right to tell us
when we can climb and when we can't.

468
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,872
I'm not telling you,
I'm asking.

469
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:12,254
We know everybody is planning to summit,
for instance...

470
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:15,922
You know we can avoid the chaos
that happened at the Icefall today.

471
00:28:16,205 --> 00:28:18,572
Adventure Consultants
are aiming for May 10th.

472
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:19,867
So are we, man.

473
00:28:19,892 --> 00:28:22,293
- Us too.
- May 10th.

474
00:28:24,272 --> 00:28:27,184
Okay, that's bumper to bumper traffic
on the Hillary step.

475
00:28:27,209 --> 00:28:28,493
Yes it is, that's my point.

476
00:28:28,518 --> 00:28:31,991
Look, this is ridiculous.
We summiting when we want.

477
00:28:32,016 --> 00:28:35,990
Alright. And I don't need
your permission to climb the mountain.

478
00:28:36,015 --> 00:28:37,882
Ian, have you seen how
many people here

479
00:28:37,922 --> 00:28:39,006
- ... at Base Camp this year.
- We're finish here.

480
00:28:39,031 --> 00:28:41,930
- Come on, lads.
- Hey, man.

481
00:28:57,294 --> 00:28:59,253
Ah.
Come in, man.

482
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:00,644
- Hi.
- Ha ha.

483
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:03,096
- Have a drink, Rob.
- Yeah, have a drink.

484
00:29:03,121 --> 00:29:04,507
Na zdorovye. (*To health.)

485
00:29:04,532 --> 00:29:07,000
- Nostrovia.  (*Cheers)
- Nostrovia.  (*Cheers)

486
00:29:07,025 --> 00:29:09,719
- With a word. Yeh.
- Um-hum.

487
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:17,645
- You're a little crook, huh.
- I know, it's just a little.

488
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:21,308
- A little touch of the deli belly.
- He means Buddha belly.

489
00:29:25,561 --> 00:29:28,154
What's going on Roberto?

490
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:38,788
I don't like the look of the
crowds on the ropes.

491
00:29:39,203 --> 00:29:42,508
We will run into some trouble
once we're above Camp 3.

492
00:29:43,133 --> 00:29:45,251
- Well. You want the top of number 10, yeah?
- Yeah.

493
00:29:45,276 --> 00:29:46,813
So do I.

494
00:29:48,404 --> 00:29:50,307
What're you saying,
we should team up?

495
00:29:50,332 --> 00:29:52,611
Well, it's an idea, yeah.

496
00:29:53,715 --> 00:29:55,815
Oh, man.

497
00:29:57,983 --> 00:30:02,362
Oh, I don't know, man.
We have different styles, man. Like...

498
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,091
All due respect,
you're a hand holder.

499
00:30:05,116 --> 00:30:07,650
I mean the best, but...

500
00:30:07,675 --> 00:30:09,992
I just believe that if you can't
get up there yourself

501
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:12,477
you shouldn't be on
the mountain at all.

502
00:30:12,932 --> 00:30:15,271
You guide your team,
I guide my.

503
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:18,627
I'm just suggesting that we work
with each other instead of against.

504
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:22,052
The only way we both summit, mate,
is that we work together.

505
00:30:22,077 --> 00:30:24,555
Particularly fixing the ropes.

506
00:30:25,058 --> 00:30:27,082
It's got to make sense.

507
00:30:29,437 --> 00:30:31,289
Ah.

508
00:30:33,424 --> 00:30:35,119
Why not.

509
00:30:36,038 --> 00:30:38,765
- Oh Yeah.
- Yeah, I see the sense in it.

510
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:40,015
Okay then.

511
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,467
- Thanks, Scott.
- Alright.

512
00:30:42,793 --> 00:30:45,273
Who's going to lead
when we get up there.

513
00:30:50,026 --> 00:30:53,345
Rob, if I say I want to lead,
could it be done?

514
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,219
- Whoa whoa whoa.
- Okay, hey.

515
00:30:59,244 --> 00:31:02,571
You got to work with Ang Dorjee.
'cause we're working together now.

516
00:31:03,292 --> 00:31:07,795
He's just saying if both of us...
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.

517
00:31:08,306 --> 00:31:09,609
Okay.

518
00:31:10,074 --> 00:31:11,676
Ang Dorjee.

519
00:31:13,187 --> 00:31:14,542
We're all professionals here.

520
00:31:14,567 --> 00:31:16,211
We work together and
we get the job done.

521
00:31:16,236 --> 00:31:18,082
- Yes?
- Alright, yeah.

522
00:31:18,107 --> 00:31:21,002
We're planning of stashing,
what 8 bottles of "O"

523
00:31:21,027 --> 00:31:22,339
 over the South Summit.

524
00:31:22,364 --> 00:31:24,681
- Well, I'm not using "O".
- What do you mean?

525
00:31:24,706 --> 00:31:26,721
- You're not using oxygen at all?
- Come on man, you know you want it.

526
00:31:26,746 --> 00:31:28,432
In his care, don't need it.

527
00:31:28,457 --> 00:31:31,015
Yeah, but Anatoli,
you're guiding for Scott this year.

528
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,248
You have people's lives in your hands.
It's your job.

529
00:31:33,273 --> 00:31:36,058
Never used it.
Never will.

530
00:31:36,224 --> 00:31:38,856
Bigger problems if you run out.

531
00:31:39,547 --> 00:31:40,925
Okay.

532
00:31:41,206 --> 00:31:42,639
I'll put some more bottles 
over up there.

533
00:31:42,664 --> 00:31:44,807
- You know, that would be good.
- Alright.

534
00:31:45,135 --> 00:31:46,342
Just as long as you guys are clear.

535
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:49,123
You work for me you use oxygen,
otherwise you don't work for me.

536
00:31:49,156 --> 00:31:50,433
Hey, you don't have to ask me.

537
00:31:50,458 --> 00:31:53,877
I've been up here before without "O"s, Rob.
I don't need to deal with clients.

538
00:31:53,902 --> 00:31:56,065
- Alright. Next we have the fixed ropes.
- Yeah.

539
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:58,985
Particularly, above the Lhotse Face.

540
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:00,727
You let us start
make new fixed rope.

541
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,642
- And Southeast Ridge as well.
- Yes, it does.

542
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:04,812
Well. My idea is that
we work together

543
00:32:04,837 --> 00:32:07,155
and we fix ropes together,
we share the duties.

544
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,373
- Okay.
- Sounds good.

545
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:09,958
Alright, you and Lopsang
maybe get together,

546
00:32:09,983 --> 00:32:13,097
talk about who want to
fix what and where, okay?

547
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,021
Ah.
Only essentials.

548
00:32:15,046 --> 00:32:18,261
I'm not going to tell you what to pack,
but be brutal, okay.

549
00:32:18,286 --> 00:32:21,259
1 pint down here 
is like 10 up there.

550
00:32:21,678 --> 00:32:24,523
Light and fast.
Light and fast.

551
00:32:24,548 --> 00:32:28,571
What, and just like that
you-you killed my summit cappuccino.

552
00:32:28,959 --> 00:32:31,413
Go go go.
Run.

553
00:32:31,446 --> 00:32:34,061
That camera is totally daine.
( 5th May )

554
00:32:34,092 --> 00:32:36,330
Alright, it's going to be a tough week.
( 5th May )

555
00:32:36,355 --> 00:32:39,686
But, it's going to be the
best Friday of your lives.

556
00:32:39,711 --> 00:32:41,998
Hey, what-what are we
doing in a boat?

557
00:32:42,023 --> 00:32:44,601
- Summiting!
- Summiting!
- Summiting...!

558
00:32:46,885 --> 00:32:48,712
- Now it's up to me, right?
- Yeah, you.

559
00:32:48,737 --> 00:32:49,743
 I take 3.

560
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:52,581
- It's from Jan.
- You can't look at my card.

561
00:32:53,896 --> 00:32:55,625
I knew it was 
going to be a girl.

562
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:57,723
I can't believe it.

563
00:32:57,748 --> 00:32:59,084
It's a girl!

564
00:32:59,109 --> 00:33:02,172
- Yeah!
- That's great.

565
00:33:02,197 --> 00:33:03,658
Alright, good on you.

566
00:33:03,683 --> 00:33:06,046
I know. I knew.
I knew she was.

567
00:33:06,071 --> 00:33:08,765
- Thank you. Thank you, Doug.
- Cheers, mate.

568
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,424
When is she due?

569
00:33:10,449 --> 00:33:11,998
Mid July.
As soon as I get back.

570
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:15,371
- You can't leave now, buddy.
- Yeah, that's true.

571
00:33:15,406 --> 00:33:16,928
Hey, Rob.

572
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,368
 Yeah?

573
00:33:18,517 --> 00:33:20,238
Jan doesn't mind you being here?

574
00:33:20,263 --> 00:33:23,806
Oh oh.
Krakauer's sword is unleashed.

575
00:33:23,831 --> 00:33:26,418
It's okay. I'm...
Jan's a climber, Jon. She gets it.

576
00:33:26,443 --> 00:33:28,410
- Oh yeah?
- She is, Helen.

577
00:33:28,435 --> 00:33:29,824
Now you, Doug.
What about your wife?

578
00:33:29,849 --> 00:33:32,886
Oh, she's been fine with it
ever since we divorced.

579
00:33:33,271 --> 00:33:36,064
- She's been great with everything since then.
- I'm so sorry, buddy.

580
00:33:36,089 --> 00:33:37,591
I'm sorry.

581
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:39,229
No no no.
I asked because

582
00:33:39,254 --> 00:33:42,645
Peach said to me, "If you climb 1 more mountain,
I will divorce you."

583
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,410
And you went ahead
and then booked this trip.

584
00:33:44,435 --> 00:33:46,310
- Oh.
- Ow...

585
00:33:46,335 --> 00:33:49,292
No no no. The worst-
The worst part of it is that, I...

586
00:33:49,317 --> 00:33:52,132
I kind of forgot to tell her.

587
00:33:52,157 --> 00:33:54,567
- No.
- Ha ha ha.

588
00:33:54,592 --> 00:33:56,528
I forgot to tell her.
I did.

589
00:33:56,553 --> 00:33:59,423
Alright.
It's all on the table here.

590
00:33:59,453 --> 00:34:02,085
It hurts. It's dangerous.
It...

591
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:05,370
destroys relationships.
It's costing you all a small fortune.

592
00:34:05,395 --> 00:34:07,007
- Were there any negative aspects?
- Yeah.

593
00:34:07,032 --> 00:34:09,838
Come on, I got to ask the question.
You know I do.

594
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,715
Why?

595
00:34:12,938 --> 00:34:14,771
Why?

596
00:34:15,784 --> 00:34:16,527
Because

597
00:34:16,552 --> 00:34:19,021
- Because it's there!
- It's there!
- It's there!

598
00:34:19,046 --> 00:34:21,109
That's why.
Thank you Mr. Mallory.

599
00:34:21,134 --> 00:34:23,661
Come on, guys,
I'm-I'm serious.

600
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:25,151
- Yasuko.
- Huh?

601
00:34:25,176 --> 00:34:27,287
Why are you climbing Everest?

602
00:34:27,955 --> 00:34:28,965
Uh.

603
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:31,247
I'm 47 years old.

604
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:33,642
I have reached 6 of the 7 summits.

605
00:34:33,667 --> 00:34:38,472
So. Of course, now I have to
reach the 7th.

606
00:34:38,497 --> 00:34:39,688
- It's not an answer.
- Oh.

607
00:34:39,713 --> 00:34:41,565
Why...
No, why any summits?

608
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:44,088
- Well. I...
- Doug.

609
00:34:44,234 --> 00:34:45,718
Why?

610
00:34:46,315 --> 00:34:48,466
- Come on. Tell him about the kids.
- What.

611
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,786
- Tell him about the kids.
- Yeah.

612
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:53,057
- Oh. I...
- You have kids?

613
00:34:53,164 --> 00:34:54,829
Yeah, I have kids.
But...

614
00:34:54,901 --> 00:34:59,120
I thought I told you their's...
their elementary school back home...

615
00:34:59,145 --> 00:35:01,294
I've been going and talking
to the kids there and they

616
00:35:01,319 --> 00:35:04,544
actual helped me raised some
of the money to come and...

617
00:35:04,574 --> 00:35:07,712
gave me a flag to plant
on the Summit and...

618
00:35:08,156 --> 00:35:11,135
so, I was thinking maybe it's...

619
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:17,211
they see an...a regular guy can,
you know, follow impossible dreams.

620
00:35:17,236 --> 00:35:21,594
Maybe they will be inspired to
do the same, I guess.

621
00:35:21,759 --> 00:35:27,841
I'm climbing Mount Everest
because I can.

622
00:35:28,373 --> 00:35:33,857
Because, to be able to climb that high and
see that kind of beauty nobody ever sees,

623
00:35:34,904 --> 00:35:37,132
it'll be a crime not to.

624
00:35:38,578 --> 00:35:39,664
Yeh yeh, Dougy.

625
00:35:39,689 --> 00:35:41,966
- There you go.
- I like that.

626
00:35:47,077 --> 00:35:48,218
Hello.

627
00:35:48,243 --> 00:35:50,876
Hey.
Did I wake you?

628
00:35:51,174 --> 00:35:52,796
No.

629
00:35:52,974 --> 00:35:55,490
I did to, you liar.

630
00:35:58,301 --> 00:36:00,632
- You okay?
- Yeah.

631
00:36:00,657 --> 00:36:03,936
Yeah yeah, I'm good.
I'm better. I'm better now.

632
00:36:04,431 --> 00:36:06,059
I missed you.

633
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:09,420
We go for the final ascend tomorrow.

634
00:36:09,445 --> 00:36:12,413
Oh. So, you're...
you summit on Friday?

635
00:36:12,445 --> 00:36:14,376
Yeah.
10th.

636
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:18,213
- It's your lucky day.
- It is.

637
00:36:18,238 --> 00:36:19,901
How's the weather?

638
00:36:20,384 --> 00:36:21,918
It's good.

639
00:36:21,943 --> 00:36:24,113
Yeah, I think we're going to
get a good window.

640
00:36:24,485 --> 00:36:28,279
- So... It's a girl.
- Oh yeah.

641
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,965
And, did you go to the doctor?
Did you get your scan done?

642
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:33,646
- Did you see her?
- Yes, we're good.

643
00:36:35,495 --> 00:36:38,319
And?
Come on, what does she look like?

644
00:36:38,344 --> 00:36:41,272
Oh, you know.
Blonde hair, nice smile.

645
00:36:41,297 --> 00:36:44,683
Perfect height-weight ratio,
she's going to be a great climber.

646
00:36:46,326 --> 00:36:50,169
She's here, Rob...
already.

647
00:36:50,627 --> 00:36:53,070
- Wow.
- Me and you.

648
00:36:53,095 --> 00:36:55,330
And a little bear, huh.

649
00:36:56,471 --> 00:36:58,174
And in one day,

650
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:01,219
you,
me,

651
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,654
and our little Sarah, we'll all
go climbing together. Huh.

652
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:06,560
Sarah?

653
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,918
Yeah.
What do you think?

654
00:37:08,944 --> 00:37:11,043
- No way.
- Come on.

655
00:37:11,068 --> 00:37:13,502
- No.
- Please, think about it.

656
00:37:13,527 --> 00:37:15,519
- No.
- Huh.

657
00:37:19,542 --> 00:37:23,113
- You're still there?
- Of course I'm still here.

658
00:37:25,817 --> 00:37:27,495
I love you.

659
00:37:27,801 --> 00:37:29,788
I love you too.

660
00:37:34,108 --> 00:37:35,692
Sleep well, my love.

661
00:37:35,716 --> 00:37:38,049
Alright.
Bye.

662
00:38:00,715 --> 00:38:07,131
* Everest climbers
Puja blessing ceremony

663
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:29,400
- I need to take him down.
- Yeah.

664
00:38:29,623 --> 00:38:31,572
You can't get Scott on the radio?

665
00:38:31,597 --> 00:38:34,538
No.
No, I think he's-he's up ahead.

666
00:38:44,049 --> 00:38:46,292
Best not to stay
too long at the Summit.

667
00:38:46,317 --> 00:38:48,427
It's a long way to go, man.

668
00:38:50,863 --> 00:38:54,204
Head down,
one step at a time.

669
00:38:54,229 --> 00:38:56,291
You got it, boss.

670
00:38:58,671 --> 00:39:00,368
You seen Dale?

671
00:39:00,393 --> 00:39:03,327
Yeah, and he wasn’t looking too good,
but...

672
00:39:03,352 --> 00:39:06,579
Neal seem to have
handle the situation.

673
00:39:06,604 --> 00:39:07,964
Try to use your radio.

674
00:39:07,989 --> 00:39:10,330
- You kidding me.
- No.

675
00:39:10,649 --> 00:39:13,043
Guess it's not working, huh.

676
00:39:13,803 --> 00:39:15,423
I'm going down to Camp 1.

677
00:39:15,448 --> 00:39:17,401
If he's not doing so well,
I'm going to take him down to Base Camp.

678
00:39:17,426 --> 00:39:18,769
and I'll head back up.

679
00:39:18,794 --> 00:39:21,626
- You guys alright?
- Yeah.

680
00:39:22,771 --> 00:39:24,646
He can't be too far
ahead of you, mate.

681
00:39:24,671 --> 00:39:27,453
Yeah.
I'll make it down in half the time.

682
00:39:28,585 --> 00:39:31,557
I'm going to catch you.
Woo.

683
00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:34,023
Woo.
I'll catch you.

684
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:37,191
Cheers, mate.

685

Rob to Guy.

687
00:39:49,521 --> 00:39:51,616
- Rob to Guy. Are you there, mate?
(MOUNT PUMORI, 8 KM WEST OF EVEREST)

688
00:39:51,641 --> 00:39:54,310
- Guy to Rob. I'm here.
(MOUNT PUMORI, 8 KM WEST OF EVEREST)

689
00:39:54,335 --> 00:39:57,855
Good to hear you, Guy.
Where are you?

690
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,040
Camp 1, Pumori.

691
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:01,973
Yeah.

692
00:40:01,998 --> 00:40:04,723
There you go,

693
00:40:04,927 --> 00:40:07,849
Listen, I think you're on the
wrong mountain there.

694
00:40:08,237 --> 00:40:10,130
Look, I can't talk and
we got to get out of here.

695
00:40:10,155 --> 00:40:13,641
Alright, mate. Oh, listen.
You take care on the kiddy slope.

696
00:40:13,666 --> 00:40:15,626
I ought to get back
 to the real thing.

697
00:40:15,651 --> 00:40:18,432
Hey, don't worry, Rob.
I'll keep an eye on you.

698
00:40:27,588 --> 00:40:29,939
Aye!
Watch out!

699
00:40:30,945 --> 00:40:32,140
Aw!

700
00:40:33,483 --> 00:40:34,914
ROB!

701
00:40:34,938 --> 00:40:37,099
- Rob!
- I got you.

702
00:40:47,364 --> 00:40:49,112
Harold, you okay?

703
00:40:52,571 --> 00:40:54,235
Is everyone okay?

704
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,992
We're okay!

705
00:41:01,094 --> 00:41:02,862
Come here, come here, come here.
Sit. Sit down, sit.

706
00:41:02,887 --> 00:41:04,559
I'm fine.

707
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,326
Look at me.

708
00:41:07,351 --> 00:41:08,572
- Look at me!
- I'm fine, mate.

709
00:41:08,597 --> 00:41:09,755
Look at me, Harold.

710
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,587
Look.
I'm tell you, I'm alright.

711
00:41:11,612 --> 00:41:13,574
- Okay.
- I'm alright.

712
00:41:15,548 --> 00:41:17,248
- Harold.
- Thank you.

713
00:41:17,273 --> 00:41:19,347
Don't do that to me again, aye.

714
00:41:20,523 --> 00:41:22,326
Rob, I'm sorry.

715
00:41:23,198 --> 00:41:24,485
Okay, mate.

716
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:27,541
I'll get drop back with Frank's,
you start with him, alright?

717
00:41:27,638 --> 00:41:29,933
- Alright.
- Alright.

718
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:35,200
- Alright. Straight here.
(Camp 3 : 7,315 metres)

719

Let's get him on the oxygen.

720
00:41:36,701 --> 00:41:38,627
Bravo to Scott Fischer.
Bravo to Scott Fischer.

721
00:41:38,652 --> 00:41:40,596
Mountain Madness, have you copy?

722
00:41:40,621 --> 00:41:43,340
Hey, man.
Scott here.

723
00:41:43,365 --> 00:41:46,333
I've been down to Base Camp
and I'm back to Camp 1.

724
00:41:46,358 --> 00:41:47,702
I'll catch you tomorrow.

725
00:41:47,727 --> 00:41:50,446
What? You not going to
rest up a day first, huh?

726
00:41:51,629 --> 00:41:55,523
Scott, you sound a little rough.
Hey, take an extra day.

727
00:41:55,548 --> 00:41:58,724
No way, Jose.
What, missing out on all the fun.

728
00:41:59,281 --> 00:42:03,036
It's a lot of up and down in...
one day even for you, Scott.

729
00:42:03,073 --> 00:42:05,471
You know what they say, man.

730
00:42:05,758 --> 00:42:08,356
It's not the altitude,
it's the attitude.

731
00:42:10,118 --> 00:42:11,892
You sure you're going to be okay?

732
00:42:11,917 --> 00:42:13,215
- Scott?
- I'll be good.

733
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,202
Just taking a shot of
dexamethasone now.

734
00:42:17,085 --> 00:42:19,074
Just don't push yourself too hard.

735
00:42:19,099 --> 00:42:21,212
Okay?
Over and out.

736
00:42:27,498 --> 00:42:31,118
Rob, I've just been over the Miles
to get a weather update.

737
00:42:31,329 --> 00:42:35,920
It's moving fast.
It's changed course slightly

738
00:42:35,945 --> 00:42:39,646
and it could still go north but
if it doesn't

739
00:42:39,671 --> 00:42:44,112
It's gonna hit sometime
on the 11th, I reckon.

740
00:42:45,947 --> 00:42:48,370
Get some weather forecast, Helen.

741
00:42:48,395 --> 00:42:50,556
The mountain makes it's own weather.

742
00:42:50,581 --> 00:42:52,518
We're keeping an eye on it.

743
00:42:52,638 --> 00:42:54,858
Yeah, sure.
Just, letting you know.

744
00:42:54,893 --> 00:42:56,623
Appreciate it, Helen.

745
00:42:59,182 --> 00:43:01,990
Why're we doing this to ourselves?

746
00:43:05,605 --> 00:43:07,756
Oh, it's crazy.

747
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:14,978
You know I never told
Krakauer this.

748
00:43:15,011 --> 00:43:17,690
When he was asking us
why we climb Everest.

749
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,420
When I'm at home...

750
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:23,599
I just got this big...

751
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,809
black cloud following me.

752
00:43:26,834 --> 00:43:28,935
You know, like a depression.

753
00:43:29,761 --> 00:43:31,682
When I'm out here...

754
00:43:31,923 --> 00:43:34,144
on a mountain,
any mountain,

755
00:43:36,254 --> 00:43:38,308
it's just like it's a cure.

756
00:43:39,851 --> 00:43:41,946
Feel like I'm reborn.

757
00:43:42,439 --> 00:43:44,438
So, you're happy now?

758
00:43:45,927 --> 00:43:48,139
Now I'm starting to wonder.

759
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:52,883
This is suffering, man.

760
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:56,379
This is suffering.

761
00:43:56,404 --> 00:43:58,050
Yeah.

762
00:43:58,381 --> 00:44:00,866
Suffer a few more days.

763
00:44:01,198 --> 00:44:04,841
The rest of your life, you'll be a guy
that climb to the top of Everest.

764
00:44:10,061 --> 00:44:12,217
I just hope I get there.

765
00:44:13,075 --> 00:44:14,814
Yeah.

766
00:44:15,855 --> 00:44:18,394
Just hope I get there
and get home.

767
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:26,485
What do you think, Mike?

768
00:44:29,158 --> 00:44:32,986
Almost pretty good.
A little bit of wind up high.

769
00:44:33,382 --> 00:44:35,569
And if it picks up, we can
always come back down.

770
00:44:35,594 --> 00:44:38,327
- Exactly.
- It's your call, Rob.

771
00:44:39,166 --> 00:44:41,050
Let's get them all going.

772
00:45:32,117 --> 00:45:35,497
Camp 4 : 7,951 metres

773
00:45:35,522 --> 00:45:37,234
Hey, Rob!

774
00:45:37,259 --> 00:45:40,621
- You, okay?
- Not good!

775
00:45:45,912 --> 00:45:48,958
I'm hoping it's going to
die down after sun down.

776
00:45:48,983 --> 00:45:50,832
Been doing that.

777
00:45:51,105 --> 00:45:52,660
I don't like this.

778
00:45:52,685 --> 00:45:55,876
We don't go
if it doesn't calm.

779
00:45:56,075 --> 00:46:00,031
- I talk to Scott when he come's here.
- Okay.

780
00:46:12,426 --> 00:46:13,678
Scott!

781
00:46:13,703 --> 00:46:16,719
- Scott!
- Anatoli, here.

782
00:46:27,347 --> 00:46:29,939
Anatoli, where is Rob?

783
00:46:29,964 --> 00:46:32,370
Where are they?
Did he go down?

784
00:46:32,774 --> 00:46:36,432
Where's Rob?
What's Rob's team doing?

785
00:46:36,457 --> 00:46:40,056
Rob will see
if it passes.

786
00:46:40,706 --> 00:46:42,675
If he wait.

787
00:46:45,195 --> 00:46:48,035
- We wait.
- Okay.

788
00:46:49,353 --> 00:46:52,281
Friday, 10th May

789
00:47:01,503 --> 00:47:03,323
Hey, guys.

790
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:05,611
Come out and take a look.

791
00:47:19,779 --> 00:47:22,177
At least somebody up there loves us.

792
00:47:22,202 --> 00:47:23,888
Lovely.

793
00:47:27,294 --> 00:47:29,226
Where did the storm go?

794
00:47:29,798 --> 00:47:31,515
Exactly.

795
00:47:32,179 --> 00:47:35,856
- That's crazy.
- You ready to saddle up?

796
00:47:38,012 --> 00:47:40,223
Okay, everyone.

797
00:47:40,248 --> 00:47:42,175
We got a window.

798
00:47:42,397 --> 00:47:44,428
We don't know how long
it's going to last.

799
00:47:44,763 --> 00:47:46,702
But we're going to go for it.

800
00:47:46,866 --> 00:47:48,887
Be ready in half an hour.

801
00:47:48,912 --> 00:47:51,390
We have a 2 PM turn around.
Let's climb this thing.

802
00:47:51,415 --> 00:47:52,933
Okay.

803
00:47:56,966 --> 00:47:59,436
So, today's the day, huh?

804
00:47:59,845 --> 00:48:01,295
Yeah.

805
00:48:02,753 --> 00:48:04,524
Now or never.

806
00:48:07,409 --> 00:48:09,322
Oh boy.

807
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,919
The south Africans were
laid out at Camp 3.

808
00:48:14,944 --> 00:48:17,223
They never made it into Camp 4.

809
00:48:17,248 --> 00:48:18,915
But we got caught up in it.

810
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:23,199
- Maybe it blew though early.
- Yeah. Well, it hit us all night.

811
00:48:23,307 --> 00:48:26,074
But that was nothing,
absolutely nothing.

812
00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:28,468
So, it's definitely worth a shot.

813
00:48:28,492 --> 00:48:31,609
I'll radio Ed,
tell him you're continuing.

814
00:48:32,214 --> 00:48:34,234
Any messages?

815
00:48:34,259 --> 00:48:37,448
Yeah. Ring Jan, tell her that
we're heading out.

816
00:48:37,473 --> 00:48:40,800
I'll call you, Helen, in 12 hours
when we get to the Summit.

817
00:48:40,825 --> 00:48:42,783
Turn around is 2 PM.

818
00:48:42,808 --> 00:48:44,724
Good luck and
god speed to you all.

819
00:48:44,749 --> 00:48:46,590
Okay. Thank, Helen.
Bye bye.

820
00:48:46,615 --> 00:48:47,917
I'll see you guys up there.

821
00:48:47,942 --> 00:48:49,257
- Take it easy, Scott.
- Let's do it.

822
00:48:49,282 --> 00:48:51,274
I'll get a couple of hours of sleep
and I'll be right behind you.

823
00:48:51,299 --> 00:48:52,654
- Yeah, okay.
- See you at the top.

824
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:55,397
- Have fun, Pittman. Yeah.
- You get some rest, okay.

825
00:48:55,422 --> 00:48:56,566
See you there.

826
00:48:56,591 --> 00:48:59,545
- You got the ropes for the Hillary Step?
- Yeah.

827
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:00,899
- Okay.
- Okay.

828
00:49:00,924 --> 00:49:02,496
Okay.

829
00:49:11,578 --> 00:49:15,520
The Balcony : 8,412 metres

830
00:49:15,545 --> 00:49:18,581
04:30 AM

831
00:49:19,181 --> 00:49:21,133
Can we go any faster?

832
00:49:21,158 --> 00:49:22,882
Not a chance we can
go faster here.

833
00:49:22,907 --> 00:49:26,321
It's too difficult.
This could take a while.

834
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,334
We're losing time.

835
00:49:43,975 --> 00:49:45,661
This might be it.

836
00:49:45,801 --> 00:49:47,240
I don't know.

837
00:49:47,608 --> 00:49:51,041
Okay.
Guys, go in front of us.

838
00:49:51,075 --> 00:49:53,808
- Alright, Beck, let's sit you down.
- Okay.

839
00:49:59,646 --> 00:50:02,571
Beck.
Look at me.

840
00:50:04,406 --> 00:50:05,779
I need to send you down
with someone.

841
00:50:05,804 --> 00:50:07,503
- No. I don't want to go down, Rob.
- No, you got to go down.

842
00:50:07,528 --> 00:50:09,548
I don't want to go down.

843
00:50:13,278 --> 00:50:14,688
Okay.

844
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:20,457
Alright, Beck.
Listen.

845
00:50:20,482 --> 00:50:22,652
You can wait here for half and hour.
Beck, listen to me.

846
00:50:22,677 --> 00:50:27,959
If it gets better by then,
join in the queue and keep going up.

847
00:50:27,984 --> 00:50:30,991
If it doesn't get better, Beck,
I'm sorry, mate. It's over.

848
00:50:31,016 --> 00:50:34,828
Sherpas are going to go and drop off the
extra oxygen on the south side while they can.

849
00:50:34,853 --> 00:50:38,082
I'm going to send one of them
down for you. Is that clear?

850
00:50:38,107 --> 00:50:40,354
- Yeah?
- Alright.

851
00:50:40,379 --> 00:50:43,525
Okay, mate.
Alright.

852
00:50:46,886 --> 00:50:48,644
God speed.

853
00:50:49,675 --> 00:50:51,874
Sandy, do you want to go down?

854
00:50:51,899 --> 00:50:54,531
What?
No, no way.

855
00:50:54,556 --> 00:50:56,646
Look, Lopsang, I'm going
to make it to the top.

856
00:50:56,671 --> 00:50:58,730
- Do you understand?
- Okay.

857
00:50:58,756 --> 00:51:02,332
- I'm not going back, okay?
- Okay.

858
00:51:02,811 --> 00:51:06,211
The Southeast Ridge.

859
00:51:13,081 --> 00:51:15,307
Hey, where are the ropes?

860
00:51:15,332 --> 00:51:17,829
There is no rope.
No rope.

861
00:51:17,854 --> 00:51:19,712
Yeah?
They should have been fixed.

862
00:51:19,737 --> 00:51:21,367
Do you have more in your pack.

863
00:51:21,392 --> 00:51:24,029
Lopsang has the ropes.
He's not here.

864
00:51:24,054 --> 00:51:27,419
- No ropes?
- No.

865
00:51:27,444 --> 00:51:29,908
Alright.
Neal.

866
00:51:29,948 --> 00:51:33,178
Guy to Rob.
Listen, we got a problem here, mate.

867
00:51:33,203 --> 00:51:37,009
There's no fixed ropes on the
crevasse to Hillary Step, over.

868
00:51:37,034 --> 00:51:38,555
Where is Ang dorjee and Lopsang?

869
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:41,847
Yeah, I got Ang Dorjee here
but there's not sign of Lopsang.

870
00:51:41,879 --> 00:51:45,903
So, me, Neal, Anatoli are going
to set some new ones, over.

871
00:51:45,928 --> 00:51:47,131
- Fine then.
- Yeah.

872
00:51:47,156 --> 00:51:49,754
- Good.
- Let's do it.

873
00:51:53,903 --> 00:51:57,373
- What's going on?
- No fixed rope.

874
00:51:57,398 --> 00:51:59,046
What?

875
00:52:27,995 --> 00:52:29,439
That's it.

876
00:52:29,464 --> 00:52:31,829
1 step at a time, Doug.

877
00:52:39,803 --> 00:52:42,240
Come on, Dougy.
Deep breaths, Dougy.

878
00:52:42,265 --> 00:52:44,177
- I can't, man.
- Keep it on. Keep it on.

879
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:46,262
- Rob.
- Deep breaths, Dougy. Yeah.

880
00:52:46,287 --> 00:52:47,805
Hang on.

881
00:52:55,489 --> 00:52:57,673
You can do this , Dougy.

882
00:52:57,698 --> 00:53:00,497
- I know you can, pal.
- Yeah?

883
00:53:01,502 --> 00:53:04,381
I don't want to see you
back here the third time, mate.

884
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:24,540
John.
You heading back down?

885
00:53:25,254 --> 00:53:28,930
There's a hold up. There's no fixed ropes
above the South Summit.

886
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:30,418
Yeah.
I know, mate.

887
00:53:30,443 --> 00:53:32,382
But we are sorting that
situation out now.

888
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:34,733
Ran out of juice waiting.

889
00:53:34,758 --> 00:53:37,299
God.
I'm sorry, Rob.

890
00:53:37,324 --> 00:53:39,317
It's your call, pal.

891
00:53:42,097 --> 00:53:44,777
I don't want to run out
of oxygen up there.

892
00:53:45,315 --> 00:53:47,063
Sorry, Rob.

893
00:53:53,591 --> 00:53:55,166
We've a little bit of a set back.

894
00:53:55,191 --> 00:53:58,365
Lou, Stuart and John Taske
just turned back, just...

895
00:53:58,390 --> 00:54:00,422
just below the South Summit.

896
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:03,566
- How are the conditions so far?
- Cold and windy.

897
00:54:03,591 --> 00:54:07,538
- Okay, let me know, Rob.
- Okay, Helen. Thanks, bye bye.

898
00:54:08,822 --> 00:54:12,980
I hope we're not looking at another year
with no clients at the top.

899
00:54:13,353 --> 00:54:15,469
Well, if that ain't going to
move them pretty soon.

900
00:54:15,494 --> 00:54:17,614
They're out of time, aren't they?

901
00:54:17,639 --> 00:54:19,607
Yeah.
And...

902
00:54:19,959 --> 00:54:23,075
What's Jon going to say
about that in his article.

903
00:54:24,103 --> 00:54:25,239
- It's Rob.
(The Hillary Step : 8,760 metres)

904
00:54:25,264 --> 00:54:26,342
- Guy.
(The Hillary Step : 8,760 metres)

905
00:54:26,367 --> 00:54:28,671
- We just lost Lou, Stuart and John Taske.
(The Hillary Step : 8,760 metres)

906
00:54:28,696 --> 00:54:30,841
What's going on?
What's the hold up?

907
00:54:30,872 --> 00:54:32,519
Yeah, yeah, mate.
We...

908
00:54:32,544 --> 00:54:36,759
We sent Anatoli and Neal
to the top of the Step

909
00:54:36,784 --> 00:54:38,874
fixing the ropes.

910
00:54:38,982 --> 00:54:42,743
We're at the-
at the Face's Step, over.

911
00:54:44,635 --> 00:54:46,954
- So, how's Doug doing?
- Doug's just behind me.

912
00:54:46,979 --> 00:54:49,256
I left him behind
to scoot forward.

913
00:54:49,281 --> 00:54:51,194
Yeah, I got eyes on you right now.
Yep, that's me.

914
00:54:51,219 --> 00:54:53,076
Let's move this

915
00:54:53,752 --> 00:54:55,541
as quickly as possible, over.

916
00:54:55,566 --> 00:54:59,095
We'll start moving everybody up
as soon as we get the all clear.

917
00:55:00,104 --> 00:55:02,756
Rob to base. Rob to base, Hel.
Copy, Helen.

918
00:55:02,781 --> 00:55:04,937
- You alright?
- Copy. Base camp to Rob.

919
00:55:04,962 --> 00:55:09,617
Have you... Have you heard from Scott?
Anyone manage to find out where he is, over.

920
00:55:09,757 --> 00:55:12,685
Woo-Eee!
Yo, dude.

921
00:55:12,715 --> 00:55:15,947
Look. Where are you, mate? We got a
real logjam here at the Hillary Step, over.

922
00:55:15,972 --> 00:55:18,338
- I'm more than an hour behind.
- Just chill.

923
00:55:18,363 --> 00:55:21,088
Everybody is just sitting there
using up their oxygen.

924
00:55:21,113 --> 00:55:23,171
Get here as soon as you can.

925
00:55:25,144 --> 00:55:27,163
- Oh my god. You okay, Beck?
- Yeah.

926
00:55:27,188 --> 00:55:31,300
Oh I got a little problem with my eyes.
You guys turning back?

927
00:55:31,325 --> 00:55:33,741
There's a logjam below
the Hillary Step.

928
00:55:33,766 --> 00:55:36,774
It's crazy.
Come down with us.

929
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:39,958
No, I can't.
Promise Rob I'd wait for him.

930
00:55:39,983 --> 00:55:41,325
- Your call.
- I'm good.

931
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:42,965
See you down there.

932
00:55:43,736 --> 00:55:46,335
Neal.
Andy.

933
00:55:46,654 --> 00:55:48,578
Okay, Anatoli.

934
00:55:48,603 --> 00:55:50,223
I'm done.

935
00:55:51,192 --> 00:55:54,784
Safe to climb.

936
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:56,181
Okay, we're climbing up.

937
00:55:56,215 --> 00:55:57,466
- Hey, Mike.
- What?

938
00:55:57,491 --> 00:55:59,373
- You mind if I go first?
- Why.

939
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:01,605
I'm running pretty low on "O".

940
00:56:02,722 --> 00:56:04,861
Rob, it's Mike here.

941
00:56:04,885 --> 00:56:07,447
Eh. We have been all clear
on this end.

942
00:56:08,004 --> 00:56:11,531
I'm going to stay here with Yasuko
till we got a clear line.

943
00:56:11,796 --> 00:56:15,174
I'll be here till I get a visual
on Doug. Over and out

944
00:57:10,279 --> 00:57:12,515
* 01:14 PM *

945
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:14,438
We did it.

946
00:57:31,885 --> 00:57:34,261
Hey.

947
00:57:52,353 --> 00:57:54,368
Thank you very much.

948
00:57:54,393 --> 00:57:56,623
Thank you, Mom.

949
00:58:08,454 --> 00:58:10,295
Yasuko.

950
00:58:12,459 --> 00:58:13,815
- Seven.
- Seven.

951
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:16,443
- 7 summits.
- 7 summits.

952
00:58:16,548 --> 00:58:17,744
Come here.

953
00:58:17,769 --> 00:58:22,233
I'm so proud of you, Yasuko.
So proud.

954
00:58:22,258 --> 00:58:24,042
Thank you.

955
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:28,911
Thank you.
Thank you.

956
00:58:29,499 --> 00:58:31,894
Rob to base.
Rob to base.

957
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:37,066
Rob, this is Helen.
Hello, where are you?

958
00:58:37,091 --> 00:58:39,542
I'm at the top of Everest, Helen.
We made it.

959
00:58:39,566 --> 00:58:40,879
- Yeah.
- They did it.

960
00:58:40,905 --> 00:58:42,355
Copy us, over.

961
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:47,225
Oh, we copy you loud and clear, Rob.
It's wonderful to hear your voice up there.

962
00:58:47,258 --> 00:58:48,555
Who are you with again, Rob?

963
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:50,735
At the moment
I'm with Mike and Yasuko.

964
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,310
Good job, man.

965
00:58:52,335 --> 00:58:54,214
Rob, see you.
Thank you.

966
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:56,969
Jon and Kasischke have
already been and gone.

967
00:58:56,994 --> 00:58:58,914
Doug is just coming over the horizon.

968
00:58:58,939 --> 00:59:00,936
And-And what about Beck?

969
00:59:00,961 --> 00:59:03,660
Beck was having a problem
with his eye sight.

970
00:59:03,685 --> 00:59:07,927
He waited on the Southeast Ridge,
on the Balcony.

971
00:59:07,952 --> 00:59:10,108
But the first three
never came back, over.

972
00:59:10,133 --> 00:59:13,292
And I... I guess you'll be
leaving right away, yes?

973
00:59:13,317 --> 00:59:15,913
Moving off in a few minutes
just as soon I see Doug,

974
00:59:15,938 --> 00:59:17,745
we'll be heading back down, over.

975
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:20,712
Alright, understood.
Oh, that's terrific, Rob.

976
00:59:20,737 --> 00:59:23,020
We're all keeping
our fingers cross for Doug.

977
00:59:23,045 --> 00:59:25,024
Over and out, Helen.

978
00:59:37,202 --> 00:59:39,162
- Congratulation.
- You're welcome.

979
00:59:39,187 --> 00:59:42,122
Yeah, ladsy.
You did it.

980
01:00:15,816 --> 01:00:17,787
You look terrible.

981
01:00:18,423 --> 01:00:22,160
My stories,
not so good, man.

982
01:00:22,447 --> 01:00:25,719
- You see Doug?
- Oh, yeah. He's way way...

983
01:00:26,207 --> 01:00:28,597
way back there, man.

984
01:00:28,622 --> 01:00:31,832
Hey, Roberto.
Where're the rest of your guys.

985
01:00:31,857 --> 01:00:35,381
'Cause I'm pretty sure
my whole team

986
01:00:35,406 --> 01:00:36,719
made it up, yeah.

987
01:00:36,744 --> 01:00:38,553
Heh heh heh.
I saw them.

988
01:00:38,578 --> 01:00:40,743
Don't worry.
I won't tell Krakauer.

989
01:00:40,768 --> 01:00:43,344
Hold on, mate.
I know it's bad, heh.

990
01:00:43,369 --> 01:00:45,415
I'll give you it this year.

991
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,779
Scott, you really
don't look too good.

992
01:00:47,804 --> 01:00:49,208
- Lopsang.
- Yeah.

993
01:00:49,233 --> 01:00:51,448
Come, mate.
Let's get him down.

994
01:00:58,209 --> 01:00:59,574
Alright.

995
01:00:59,913 --> 01:01:01,439
Let's go.

996
01:01:25,558 --> 01:01:28,764
Harold.
What're you doing?

997
01:01:29,082 --> 01:01:31,311
I'm just trying to
sort out the "O".

998
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:33,813
I can't find any full ones.

999
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:35,693
There's full bottles,
I saw them on the way up.

1000
01:01:35,718 --> 01:01:36,797
No.

1001
01:01:36,822 --> 01:01:38,604
So I pretty sure you
just running out of luck.

1002
01:01:38,629 --> 01:01:41,883
- No. They just have, they're not full.
- Harold. Listen, I saw...

1003
01:01:41,908 --> 01:01:44,961
Look, Mike.
I've checked twice, alright.

1004
01:01:45,259 --> 01:01:48,593
Yeah.
Alright, man.

1005
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:51,212
I'm going down.

1006
01:01:52,695 --> 01:01:54,218
Yeah.

1007
01:01:57,022 --> 01:02:01,402
03:15 PM

1008
01:02:02,391 --> 01:02:04,224
Doug. Doug.
Doug.

1009
01:02:05,379 --> 01:02:06,994
- It's over, mate.
- No.

1010
01:02:07,019 --> 01:02:08,895
I' sorry.
No no no no.

1011
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:11,306
Doug.
You're too late, okay.

1012
01:02:12,067 --> 01:02:14,645
You guys keep going, mate,
I'll catch up.

1013
01:02:14,670 --> 01:02:16,406
Doug. Doug.
Doug, listen to me.

1014
01:02:16,431 --> 01:02:18,207
- It's way too long, it's over.
- No, it's not.

1015
01:02:18,232 --> 01:02:21,040
Now, listen to me, mate.
I'm sorry.

1016
01:02:21,065 --> 01:02:23,357
But I got to turn you around.

1017
01:02:23,382 --> 01:02:24,884
Okay.

1018
01:02:25,729 --> 01:02:27,406
I can do it.

1019
01:02:28,592 --> 01:02:32,109
It's right here, man.
It's right here.

1020
01:02:32,683 --> 01:02:35,975
I'm not coming back next year, man.
It's my last chance.

1021
01:02:39,496 --> 01:02:41,869
You got to let me do this.

1022
01:02:43,296 --> 01:02:45,179
Let me do this.

1023
01:02:45,618 --> 01:02:47,319
- Okay.
- Please, Rob.

1024
01:02:47,344 --> 01:02:50,228
- Let's do it. Let's get it done.
- Yeah.

1025
01:02:50,253 --> 01:02:52,563
- Come on.
- Okay.

1026
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,179
Alright, then.

1027
01:03:30,655 --> 01:03:32,262
- Beck?
- What?

1028
01:03:32,287 --> 01:03:35,426
- Are you okay?
- Who is there?

1029
01:03:35,451 --> 01:03:38,721
- It's Jon.
- I'm not seeing too well, Jon.

1030
01:03:38,746 --> 01:03:40,728
Fre-Freezing.

1031
01:03:41,647 --> 01:03:43,663
Mike's just behind me.

1032
01:03:43,688 --> 01:03:45,622
He's back there with Yasuko.

1033
01:03:45,647 --> 01:03:48,927
You'll be okay.
Mike's right behind me.

1034
01:03:48,952 --> 01:03:50,735
You okay?

1035
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,573
I'll see you then.

1036
01:03:58,173 --> 01:04:00,071
There she is.

1037
01:04:00,096 --> 01:04:02,098
Almost there, mate.

1038
01:04:03,587 --> 01:04:05,891
Dig deep, Doug.
Dig deep.

1039
01:04:05,916 --> 01:04:07,553
There you go.

1040
01:04:18,672 --> 01:04:20,707
There you go.

1041
01:04:21,079 --> 01:04:24,456
Yehhhh!

1042
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,048
Huh, you made it.

1043
01:04:34,174 --> 01:04:35,864
You did it.
Huh.

1044
01:04:35,889 --> 01:04:38,744
Yeah.
Because of you, man.

1045
01:04:47,897 --> 01:04:50,461
Guy to Rob.
You read me, mate?

1046
01:04:52,883 --> 01:04:55,126
Guy to Rob.
Are you there?

1047
01:04:57,638 --> 01:04:59,578
This is going to the kids.

1048
01:05:00,898 --> 01:05:03,259
Yehhh!

1049
01:05:06,306 --> 01:05:08,038
Hang in there, Doug.

1050
01:05:08,178 --> 01:05:09,716
Come on.

1051
01:05:10,034 --> 01:05:11,808
Easy.
Here, I got it.

1052
01:05:11,833 --> 01:05:14,302
Here.
I'm okay.

1053
01:05:14,451 --> 01:05:16,086
Yeah, I got it.

1054
01:05:18,925 --> 01:05:20,653
- Come on, let's get you up.
- I need...

1055
01:05:20,678 --> 01:05:21,951
- Huh?
- Need more "O".

1056
01:05:21,976 --> 01:05:23,258
No, Doug.
We can't give you more "O".

1057
01:05:23,283 --> 01:05:25,755
We got to get down
to the South Summit, come on.

1058
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,275
Guy going to Everest Base Camp.
Are you there, Helen?

1059
01:05:34,505 --> 01:05:36,646
Guy, this is Helen.
How is it going?

1060
01:05:36,671 --> 01:05:38,062
Yeah, I'm fine.

1061
01:05:38,087 --> 01:05:40,080
I got a clear view of the Summit
and...

1062
01:05:40,105 --> 01:05:43,396
you know, we still got climbers up there.
They are not any of ours, right?

1063
01:05:43,421 --> 01:05:45,849
We got 3 up and
they're all on their way down.

1064
01:05:45,874 --> 01:05:47,545
Well.
What are they doing there so late?

1065
01:05:47,570 --> 01:05:50,844
And there's 2 o'clock turn around time,
they're way past it.

1066
01:05:50,869 --> 01:05:53,897
Here we go. Cloud coming out
of the valley. It's a lot of it.

1067
01:05:53,922 --> 01:05:56,346
Thanks.
I'm calling them now, Guy.

1068
01:05:59,957 --> 01:06:02,152
Rob, come in.
This is Helen.

1069
01:06:04,146 --> 01:06:06,560
Rob, come in.
This is Helen.

1070
01:06:13,361 --> 01:06:14,660
Whoa!

1071
01:06:14,685 --> 01:06:18,694
Easy. Easy. Easy, Dougy.
There you go. There you go.

1072
01:06:19,805 --> 01:06:21,940
We're going to go
around the corner.

1073
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:24,863
That's it.

1074
01:06:27,429 --> 01:06:29,321
Rob, is that you?

1075
01:06:30,255 --> 01:06:31,633
Beck.

1076
01:06:32,076 --> 01:06:33,459
It's Mike, mate.

1077
01:06:33,484 --> 01:06:36,245
- What're you doing here?
- I can't see, it's bad.

1078
01:06:36,270 --> 01:06:37,756
You guys alright?

1079
01:06:37,781 --> 01:06:39,294
We got a problem with Beck.

1080
01:06:39,319 --> 01:06:41,279
Hey, Mike.
We're getting low on "O".

1081
01:06:41,304 --> 01:06:42,821
We got to move.

1082
01:06:42,846 --> 01:06:44,482
I'll get you to stand up, okay.

1083
01:06:44,507 --> 01:06:46,301
I'll take the...

1084
01:06:48,313 --> 01:06:51,899
Has anyone got eyes
 on Ang Dorjee?

1085
01:06:52,484 --> 01:06:55,906
Mate, I have just had Ang Dorjee
go past me heading down, over.

1086
01:06:55,931 --> 01:06:57,642
He's going down.

1087
01:06:57,667 --> 01:06:59,197
Can you stop him?
Can you turn him around?

1088
01:06:59,222 --> 01:07:00,983
I need someone
to come back up now.

1089
01:07:01,008 --> 01:07:03,909
Hey!
Ang Dorjee.

1090
01:07:04,746 --> 01:07:07,028
Ang Dorjee!

1091
01:07:07,053 --> 01:07:09,023
Base camp, do you copy, over.

1092
01:07:09,048 --> 01:07:11,143
Helen to Rob.
Go ahead.

1093
01:07:11,168 --> 01:07:12,554
Helen, please.

1094
01:07:12,579 --> 01:07:15,896
I need a bottle of gas
at the top of the Hillary Step.

1095
01:07:15,921 --> 01:07:17,903
I can't get him down without it.

1096
01:07:17,928 --> 01:07:20,049
I'm really stuck.

1097
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:21,822
Understood.

1098
01:07:21,847 --> 01:07:25,688
That you need a bottle of oxygen
at the bottom of the Hillary Step.

1099
01:07:25,713 --> 01:07:28,122
We're sending it up to you
as soon as we can.

1100
01:07:28,147 --> 01:07:31,411
At the top.
At the top.

1101
01:07:31,527 --> 01:07:33,862
The last thing I said to
Ang Dorjee was please

1102
01:07:33,887 --> 01:07:36,501
bring 2 bottles of gas
at the South Summit.

1103
01:07:36,526 --> 01:07:39,860
Yes, uh.
Copy that, Rob.

1104
01:07:39,941 --> 01:07:43,876
Boys. There's oxygen
at the South Summit, right?

1105
01:07:43,901 --> 01:07:46,611
No. No.
This is Harold.

1106
01:07:46,636 --> 01:07:51,072
There's no oxygen
at South Summit.

1107
01:07:51,097 --> 01:07:53,474
Repeat.
No "O".

1108
01:07:54,293 --> 01:07:57,391
Ang Dorjee stashed
4 bottles there, Harold.

1109
01:07:57,416 --> 01:07:59,414
Harold, where are you?

1110
01:08:01,879 --> 01:08:03,918
Can you hear me, Harold?

1111
01:08:04,039 --> 01:08:05,591
Harold.

1112
01:08:05,683 --> 01:08:07,589
Harold, can you hear me?

1113
01:08:07,614 --> 01:08:12,060
Figure it'll take me about half an hour
to get back up to the South Summit.

1114
01:08:15,161 --> 01:08:16,714
Okay.

1115
01:08:16,972 --> 01:08:18,577
I'm coming.

1116
01:08:20,014 --> 01:08:21,305
If you don't have oxygen, mate,

1117
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:23,252
don't come up, don't come up.
We're moving on.

1118
01:08:23,277 --> 01:08:25,279
I'm coming up to you, Rob.

1119
01:08:26,664 --> 01:08:29,337
Doug, come on, mate.
Come on!

1120
01:08:33,339 --> 01:08:37,226
Rob, this is Base Camp.
Rob, this is Base Camp.

1121
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:39,912
I copy you, Carol.

1122
01:08:39,937 --> 01:08:42,593
Rob, can you get yourself down?

1123
01:08:43,952 --> 01:08:46,339
Carol, we're not at that point yet.

1124
01:08:46,364 --> 01:08:49,114
Rob, can you let us know
who you're with?

1125
01:08:50,199 --> 01:08:51,832
I'm with Doug.

1126
01:08:51,857 --> 01:08:53,368
We're both listening.

1127
01:08:53,393 --> 01:08:56,173
Come on, Dougy. Come on, mate.
One more alping, come on.

1128
01:08:56,198 --> 01:08:58,529
Rob.
What is Doug's state of consciousness?

1129
01:08:58,554 --> 01:09:00,358
He's really weak.

1130
01:09:00,383 --> 01:09:03,427
He collapsed after he
ran out of oxygen.

1131
01:09:03,696 --> 01:09:08,122
Okay.
Give him 8 mg of dexamethasone.

1132
01:09:08,239 --> 01:09:10,642
That's 2 tablets, Rob.

1133
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:12,656
Guy to Rob.

1134
01:09:13,101 --> 01:09:14,954
Go ahead Guy.
I got you, mate.

1135
01:09:14,979 --> 01:09:17,491
Rob, I suggest
you get yourself down.

1136
01:09:17,516 --> 01:09:19,149
You know you're doing
no good up there.

1137
01:09:19,174 --> 01:09:20,905
And we got people we can
send up there to help Doug,

1138
01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:24,202
but you got to get
yourself down, you understand?

1139
01:09:24,227 --> 01:09:26,892
I mean, come on, mate.
We're playing with a man's life here.

1140
01:09:26,917 --> 01:09:29,714
There's no way I'm leaving Doug,
bellowing.

1141
01:09:31,428 --> 01:09:33,448
We got to keep moving, mate.

1142
01:09:33,473 --> 01:09:36,173
We got to keep moving,
we are in some trouble.

1143
01:09:36,198 --> 01:09:39,866
Yeah, Helen gonna... need some help.
So I'm gonna try make my way back.

1144
01:09:39,891 --> 01:09:41,235
- Okay?
- Okay.

1145
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:43,586
Alright.
Go on.

1146
01:09:52,742 --> 01:09:55,379
Hey, Scott.
Scott.

1147
01:09:55,405 --> 01:09:57,074
You okay?

1148
01:10:00,996 --> 01:10:02,775
Lopsang.

1149
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:04,796
Lopsang.

1150
01:10:06,373 --> 01:10:08,546
I'm done, pal.

1151
01:10:09,871 --> 01:10:11,597
I'm done.

1152
01:10:13,131 --> 01:10:16,748
You go...
send Anatoli.

1153
01:10:17,326 --> 01:10:20,435
Send Anatoli back with some more.

1154
01:10:22,241 --> 01:10:23,340
- Okay.
- Go.

1155
01:10:23,365 --> 01:10:24,915
Okay.

1156
01:10:25,283 --> 01:10:28,663
I will send back, Anatoli.

1157
01:10:34,236 --> 01:10:36,249
- Let's go.
- You go down.

1158
01:10:36,274 --> 01:10:37,977
No, mate.

1159
01:10:38,002 --> 01:10:39,610
No. I'm not leaving
you behind, Doug.

1160
01:10:39,635 --> 01:10:41,270
- Come on.
- Got to rest.

1161
01:10:41,295 --> 01:10:43,165
No, Doug! Come on!
Come on with me!

1162
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:46,003
I need 10 good minutes, Doug.
Come on.

1163
01:10:49,749 --> 01:10:51,702
Please, let me go.

1164
01:10:51,727 --> 01:10:55,067
Damn it.
We're at the bottom of the Step.

1165
01:10:55,282 --> 01:10:58,812
On this leg.
This leg, Dougy, come on.

1166
01:10:59,244 --> 01:11:00,910
Come on.

1167
01:11:01,358 --> 01:11:03,039
Here we go.

1168
01:11:22,356 --> 01:11:24,054
Oh no.

1169
01:11:24,439 --> 01:11:25,920
Oh no.

1170
01:11:25,945 --> 01:11:28,682
Hey. Hold it down.
Hold that down.

1171
01:11:28,707 --> 01:11:31,625
Come on, come on.
Get the chairs.

1172
01:12:12,524 --> 01:12:14,270
Come on, Dougy!

1173
01:12:14,295 --> 01:12:16,827
Go, let's go!
Hurry up!

1174
01:12:52,051 --> 01:12:56,098
Doug. I'm going to go to
the South Summit to get oxygen.

1175
01:12:56,123 --> 01:12:59,008
Okay.
Got to find oxygen.

1176
01:12:59,033 --> 01:13:01,636
But, you got to stay here!

1177
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:05,965
Okay, stay here!
Don't move, I'll be back!

1178
01:13:30,528 --> 01:13:32,233
Hey, Rob.

1179
01:14:11,008 --> 01:14:13,435
Hey!
Stop!

1180
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:15,846
That's the wrong way!

1181
01:14:17,826 --> 01:14:19,943
Turn back!

1182
01:14:36,511 --> 01:14:38,105
Easy.

1183
01:14:53,372 --> 01:14:55,042
Hey, Rob.

1184
01:14:55,677 --> 01:14:57,484
Hey, Rob!

1185
01:15:08,781 --> 01:15:10,515
Rob!

1186
01:15:11,884 --> 01:15:13,277
- I got...
- Harold?

1187
01:15:13,308 --> 01:15:15,439
I got oxygen.

1188
01:15:15,464 --> 01:15:19,964
Here.
I found some half empty ones.

1189
01:15:20,688 --> 01:15:22,986
Where's Doug?

1190
01:15:23,845 --> 01:15:26,088
Doug's gone.

1191
01:15:26,728 --> 01:15:28,465
What?

1192
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,907
Gone.

1193
01:15:44,315 --> 01:15:46,077
Come on!

1194
01:15:47,871 --> 01:15:49,498
Camp 4 is that way.

1195
01:15:49,523 --> 01:15:53,041
Get up!
Let's go.

1196
01:15:53,816 --> 01:15:57,064
Come on.
Beck.

1197
01:16:04,853 --> 01:16:07,549
I'll get help!

1198
01:16:42,328 --> 01:16:44,385
Hey!

1199
01:16:44,823 --> 01:16:46,677
Yeah!

1200
01:16:48,254 --> 01:16:50,432
Neal!

1201
01:16:52,111 --> 01:16:53,939
- Anatoli.
- Where-Where are they?

1202
01:16:53,964 --> 01:16:56,169
They're still out there.

1203
01:17:02,575 --> 01:17:05,541
Jon!
I need help!

1204
01:17:05,672 --> 01:17:06,756
What?

1205
01:17:06,791 --> 01:17:09,377
Get out there!
I need help!

1206
01:17:09,402 --> 01:17:11,800
I can't.
I can't see, Anatoli.

1207
01:17:11,825 --> 01:17:13,727
I'm snow blind.

1208
01:17:14,291 --> 01:17:17,260
Beck.
Doug.

1209
01:17:17,285 --> 01:17:20,560
They need help.
They're still out there.

1210
01:17:22,558 --> 01:17:26,502
I go find them.
You stay here.

1211
01:17:31,009 --> 01:17:33,181
12:00 AM

1212
01:17:40,632 --> 01:17:42,343
Good job.

1213
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:57,908
Hey!

1214
01:18:01,694 --> 01:18:03,519
Anatoli!

1215
01:18:03,544 --> 01:18:07,103

1216
01:18:09,315 --> 01:18:12,417
- Can you walk?
- I can't.

1217
01:18:13,810 --> 01:18:16,308
I'll come back.

1218
01:18:16,624 --> 01:18:18,642
I'll stay!

1219
01:18:24,329 --> 01:18:26,059
Give me that, come on.

1220
01:18:26,084 --> 01:18:29,226
- It won't budge. It's frozen!
- Take this.

1221
01:18:30,513 --> 01:18:32,208
The gloves.

1222
01:18:33,273 --> 01:18:35,297
I'm sorry.

1223
01:18:47,217 --> 01:18:48,737
Come on, mate.

1224
01:18:49,585 --> 01:18:51,253
Come on now.

1225
01:18:53,255 --> 01:18:55,469
Thanks for coming back.

1226
01:19:16,881 --> 01:19:19,297
- Hello, Base Camp.
- Helen, it's Jan.

1227
01:19:19,322 --> 01:19:22,388
Why haven't I heard from you?
Why hasn't anybody call me?

1228
01:19:22,413 --> 01:19:26,534
They've been hit by a storm, Jan.
It's really bad.

1229
01:19:27,687 --> 01:19:31,514
- Where is he?
- We don't know exactly. But...

1230
01:19:31,554 --> 01:19:33,450
He was still on the Summit at 4:00.

1231
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:36,759
Oh my.
Can he get down?

1232
01:19:36,784 --> 01:19:39,757
Rob can,
but Doug can't.

1233
01:19:39,879 --> 01:19:43,199
There's at least 13 people
stranded up there and...

1234
01:19:43,224 --> 01:19:45,774
while the storm is getting worse.

1235
01:19:49,263 --> 01:19:50,315
Helen!

1236
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:54,011
Get Ang Dorjee up there.
He'll bring them down.

1237
01:19:54,299 --> 01:19:56,433
- Helen, do you understand?
- Helen. Give me an update.

1238
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:59,516
Get Ang Dorjee up there.

1239
01:19:59,541 --> 01:20:01,397
Jan, yep.
We will get him.

1240
01:20:01,422 --> 01:20:04,385
And I will call you
the minute I hear from him.

1241
01:20:04,410 --> 01:20:06,556
- As soon as I hear from him.
- Thanks, Helen.

1242
01:20:06,581 --> 01:20:08,594
- Alright.
- Okay.

1243
01:20:08,625 --> 01:20:10,532
- Where is he?
- Guy, I haven't heard from him.

1244
01:20:10,557 --> 01:20:13,326
- Okay, I get it.
- I've been trying.

1245
01:20:13,351 --> 01:20:15,312
- Guy.
- Just hang on, hang on.

1246
01:20:15,337 --> 01:20:17,449
Rob, it's Guy.
Where are you?

1247
01:20:17,474 --> 01:20:20,569
- Guy, I've been doing that for the last 2 hours.
- Alright. Alright.

1248
01:20:20,594 --> 01:20:22,119
Rob, it's Guy.

1249
01:20:22,143 --> 01:20:24,896
- Just keep your energy, mate.
- Helen.

1250
01:20:24,921 --> 01:20:27,135
Once you catch a break, you move.
You know the drill.

1251
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:30,781
Hey, Guy. We got a stash of oxygen
on the South Col.

1252
01:20:30,822 --> 01:20:33,031
- Whoever needs it can have it.
- That's the way, thank you.

1253
01:20:33,056 --> 01:20:35,643
Faust's team are gonna go up,
they got a man to search,

1254
01:20:35,672 --> 01:20:37,091
as soon as they can.

1255
01:20:37,122 --> 01:20:40,218
Anyone who is going would have 
to leave at dawn.

1256
01:20:40,888 --> 01:20:42,020
That's right, David.

1257
01:20:42,045 --> 01:20:44,232
Go and let Ed knows what's going on,
I'll be right behind you.

1258
01:20:44,257 --> 01:20:45,752
Camp 4, come in.

1259
01:20:45,777 --> 01:20:48,090
Hey, Rob.  Rob, can you hear me?
( 03:00 AM )

1260
01:20:48,123 --> 01:20:53,979
David Breashears has a stash of oxygen 
at the South Col that we can use.

1261
01:20:54,003 --> 01:20:57,558
Alright, mate. Well, we're all organizing 
a team, we're coming to get you.

1262
01:21:20,119 --> 01:21:22,093
Burning up.

1263
01:21:42,171 --> 01:21:43,929
No.
No.

1264
01:21:44,990 --> 01:21:46,637
Yasuko.

1265
01:21:47,685 --> 01:21:49,651
Ohhh.

1266
01:21:49,675 --> 01:21:51,508
Andy

1267
01:21:58,072 --> 01:21:59,853
Come on!

1268
01:22:54,883 --> 01:22:58,440
Rob, talk to me, please. Pick up.
( Saturday, 11th May )

1269
01:23:02,358 --> 01:23:05,550
- Pick up, mate. Please
( 05:00 AM )

1270
01:23:32,672 --> 01:23:34,617
Was there any word from the others?

1271
01:23:34,650 --> 01:23:39,377
Anatoli managed to get 3 climbers back 
from the South Col last night. But...

1272
01:23:39,402 --> 01:23:42,054
Beck and Yasuko 
are still out there.

1273
01:23:42,086 --> 01:23:46,293
They try another search but everyone 
who's been up there is exhausted.

1274
01:23:48,348 --> 01:23:50,687
- Base.
- Rob, is that you?

1275
01:23:51,564 --> 01:23:54,538
Rob, where are you?
We're sending people for you.

1276
01:23:55,618 --> 01:23:57,674
Rob, this is Base Camp.

1277
01:24:02,933 --> 01:24:06,578
Can't move anymore.
Can't move anymore

1278
01:24:07,485 --> 01:24:09,312
Hey, mate. Yeah, I know.
I know, mate. I know.

1279
01:24:09,337 --> 01:24:11,424
You got to keep on moving.

1280
01:24:11,449 --> 01:24:13,307
Hands...

1281
01:24:13,332 --> 01:24:16,760
Can't feel my hands,
they're frozen.

1282
01:24:19,171 --> 01:24:21,745
There's "D" ice on the ice.

1283
01:24:21,771 --> 01:24:24,314
I got "D" ice in my mask.

1284
01:24:24,339 --> 01:24:26,886
That's good. You got to get 
that mask working. You got to.

1285
01:24:26,911 --> 01:24:28,434
The sun's going to come up
and...

1286
01:24:28,459 --> 01:24:30,779
you know you can get warmer 
and you can get moving.

1287
01:24:30,804 --> 01:24:32,828
- Guy.
- Yeah.

1288
01:24:32,853 --> 01:24:34,167
Guy.

1289
01:24:34,192 --> 01:24:36,892
Harold was here.
Where did he go?

1290
01:24:36,917 --> 01:24:39,477
Rob. 
Is Doug with you?

1291
01:24:42,868 --> 01:24:46,049
Doug.
Doug's gone.

1292
01:24:47,961 --> 01:24:50,122
Harold is gone.

1293
01:24:53,055 --> 01:24:55,689
Harold needed a little help.

1294
01:24:56,757 --> 01:24:58,839
Okay.
Rob, you got to get yourself down.

1295
01:24:58,864 --> 01:25:00,520
Where are you?

1296
01:25:05,511 --> 01:25:07,237
Guy.

1297
01:25:07,262 --> 01:25:09,713
I'm in the...
in the little...

1298
01:25:09,738 --> 01:25:12,967
in the little deep just below 
the South Summit.

1299
01:25:13,222 --> 01:25:14,821
Alright, you can do this.

1300
01:25:14,846 --> 01:25:17,183
You just go to, you know,
pull yourself out of that deep,

1301
01:25:17,208 --> 01:25:19,423
and slide the rest of the way.

1302
01:25:19,448 --> 01:25:21,546
Guy, send them boys.

1303
01:25:21,571 --> 01:25:25,521
Okay.
I'm going to need a little help.

1304
01:25:25,546 --> 01:25:28,703
I got some Sheapas coming 
up there with 3 oxygen.

1305
01:25:28,728 --> 01:25:30,486
You just got to
come on down, mate.

1306
01:25:30,511 --> 01:25:32,558
Aye, come on down.

1307
01:25:34,307 --> 01:25:35,818
Rob.

1308
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:42,707
Can you patch Jan through?

1309
01:25:42,732 --> 01:25:45,399
- To what?
- Pat-Patch her through.

1310
01:25:45,424 --> 01:25:47,243
Let's-Let's just try it.
Let's just...

1311
01:25:47,268 --> 01:25:50,730
put the satphone next to the radio
and uh.

1312
01:25:50,755 --> 01:25:53,936
If anyone can motivate him 
to move, then Jan will.

1313
01:25:55,156 --> 01:25:56,719
Guy to Rob.

1314
01:25:56,980 --> 01:25:58,603
Guy to Rob.

1315
01:26:01,254 --> 01:26:03,959
Guy to Rob.
Can you read me?

1316
01:26:09,355 --> 01:26:11,804
- Rob, are you there?
- We're getting him now.

1317
01:26:14,076 --> 01:26:15,962
Rob, this is Helen.

1318
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:19,518
Copy.

1319
01:26:19,725 --> 01:26:22,857
Rob, I got Jan for you.

1320
01:26:24,354 --> 01:26:26,108
My Jan?

1321
01:26:26,133 --> 01:26:27,463
Yeah. She's just here.

1322
01:26:27,488 --> 01:26:29,907
- Jan, you're on.
- Okay.

1323
01:26:30,611 --> 01:26:33,097
Hi, sweetheart.
How are you doing?

1324
01:26:36,413 --> 01:26:38,467
Hi, my love.

1325
01:26:38,492 --> 01:26:39,639
I'm a bit

1326
01:26:39,664 --> 01:26:41,808
a bit cold.

1327
01:26:42,069 --> 01:26:43,986
My love, I'm okay.

1328
01:26:44,011 --> 01:26:45,839
I know you are.

1329
01:26:45,864 --> 01:26:48,501
But the sun will warm you soon.

1330
01:26:48,892 --> 01:26:52,906
Sweetheart.
You got to get moving.

1331
01:26:53,069 --> 01:26:55,446
You got to come on down.

1332
01:26:56,269 --> 01:26:58,410
My hands...

1333
01:27:00,788 --> 01:27:02,582
frozen.

1334
01:27:03,868 --> 01:27:04,993
My...

1335
01:27:05,494 --> 01:27:08,113
My feet are frozen.

1336
01:27:08,518 --> 01:27:12,294
We're sending people up to you
with tea and "O"s

1337
01:27:12,319 --> 01:27:15,595
But, you got to get moving, Rob.
Can you hear me?

1338
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:18,219
You got to get 
your circulation going.

1339
01:27:18,244 --> 01:27:20,350
Okay, my love.

1340
01:27:20,504 --> 01:27:23,915
You do it.
Do it right now!

1341
01:27:26,227 --> 01:27:27,999
I love you.

1342
01:27:28,863 --> 01:27:30,917
Over and out.

1343
01:27:40,516 --> 01:27:42,334
Come on, Rob.

1344
01:28:32,206 --> 01:28:34,426
We can't carry them.

1345
01:28:35,656 --> 01:28:37,754
That's not possible.

1346
01:28:37,871 --> 01:28:39,502
He's good.

1347
01:28:40,809 --> 01:28:42,742
It's going to take all of your...

1348
01:28:42,767 --> 01:28:44,952
just to get ourselves down.

1349
01:28:47,207 --> 01:28:49,202
Oh, damn it.

1350
01:28:53,429 --> 01:28:56,421
Helen, it's Mike here.
Do you copy?

1351
01:28:57,265 --> 01:28:59,060
Come in, Mike.
What do you got?

1352
01:28:59,085 --> 01:29:01,891
Yasuko and Beck,

1353
01:29:01,916 --> 01:29:04,477
did not make it back to camp.

1354
01:29:08,917 --> 01:29:11,586
Okay, Mike.
Thanks for letting us know.

1355
01:29:46,486 --> 01:29:47,993
Meg.

1356
01:29:50,567 --> 01:29:52,105
Bud.

1357
01:30:24,696 --> 01:30:27,049
Hello, Base Camp.
Hello, Base Camp.

1358
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:28,891
Hello, Base Camp.

1359
01:30:29,733 --> 01:30:31,592
Ang Dorjee, this is Helen.

1360
01:30:31,617 --> 01:30:33,866
We have to turn back!

1361
01:30:33,891 --> 01:30:37,045
There is a very bad storm again.

1362
01:30:37,815 --> 01:30:39,896
- Your call, Ang Dorjee.
- Sorry.

1363
01:30:39,921 --> 01:30:43,061
We'll try it again,
when the storm pass.

1364
01:30:43,086 --> 01:30:45,267
We'll leave some tea 
and oxygen here.

1365
01:30:45,292 --> 01:30:46,842
Sorry.

1366
01:30:53,428 --> 01:30:56,098
We have to tell Rob
they're not coming.

1367
01:30:57,244 --> 01:30:58,754
Okay.

1368
01:31:07,523 --> 01:31:08,845
Hey, Rob.
It's Guy, mate.

1369
01:31:08,870 --> 01:31:10,467
Guy.

1370
01:31:12,223 --> 01:31:16,020
Can't stop shaking, Guy.

1371
01:31:16,290 --> 01:31:19,204
Boys hit a bit of a high wind.
And...

1372
01:31:19,237 --> 01:31:22,215
your best shot is going 
to be to get lower.

1373
01:31:25,060 --> 01:31:27,381
Let me think about it.

1374
01:31:29,363 --> 01:31:32,670
Don't think I can hang out 
here another night.

1375
01:31:37,580 --> 01:31:40,205
Which will I get first thing, okay.

1376
01:32:48,848 --> 01:32:50,079
Helen?

1377
01:32:50,104 --> 01:32:51,483
Yeah.

1378
01:32:51,873 --> 01:32:54,017
Yeah, he's still there.

1379
01:32:55,009 --> 01:32:57,716
He's just below the South Summit.

1380
01:32:58,044 --> 01:33:00,757
He's got oxygen
but...

1381
01:33:00,782 --> 01:33:02,733
it's iced up.

1382
01:33:02,758 --> 01:33:05,687
We don't know whether 
he's been able to free it.

1383
01:33:08,130 --> 01:33:10,074
Is anybody with him?

1384
01:33:10,099 --> 01:33:11,619
No.

1385
01:33:12,039 --> 01:33:13,546
No.

1386
01:33:14,243 --> 01:33:17,641
You have to get him down before dark.
He won't survive another night.

1387
01:33:17,765 --> 01:33:19,383
We know.

1388
01:33:20,631 --> 01:33:24,303
But the storms come back,
real bad.

1389
01:33:24,737 --> 01:33:27,783
We can't get anyone 
up to him tonight.

1390
01:33:27,808 --> 01:33:29,679
We tried.

1391
01:33:33,007 --> 01:33:35,451
He might as well be on the moon.

1392
01:33:38,184 --> 01:33:39,426
Uh.

1393
01:33:41,374 --> 01:33:43,728
Can you put me on 
with him again?

1394
01:33:43,753 --> 01:33:45,572
Of course.

1395
01:33:48,471 --> 01:33:50,937
Guy.
Get Rob.

1396
01:33:55,024 --> 01:33:56,965
Hi, Rob.
It's Guy.

1397
01:33:57,949 --> 01:34:00,108
I've got Jan for you.

1398
01:34:00,682 --> 01:34:02,146
Hold on.

1399
01:34:02,635 --> 01:34:04,477
Give me a second.

1400
01:34:18,853 --> 01:34:20,657
Okay.

1401
01:34:29,079 --> 01:34:31,374
Hi, sweetheart.

1402
01:34:32,029 --> 01:34:34,211
How are you?

1403
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:38,884
I'm thinking about you.

1404
01:34:42,737 --> 01:34:44,729
Please say, "I'm good."

1405
01:34:46,940 --> 01:34:49,218
Are you warm, my love.

1406
01:34:49,892 --> 01:34:52,742
I might have a little frostbite.

1407
01:34:54,576 --> 01:34:57,762
I'm looking forward 
to making it all better.

1408
01:35:00,417 --> 01:35:03,182
I'm waiting for you 
to come home.

1409
01:35:05,902 --> 01:35:08,226
How's Sarah?

1410
01:35:08,305 --> 01:35:10,030
Sarah?

1411
01:35:10,490 --> 01:35:12,516
Yeah.

1412
01:35:13,597 --> 01:35:15,884
Yes, Sarah is good.

1413
01:35:17,382 --> 01:35:20,089
Will you call her that for me?

1414
01:35:20,366 --> 01:35:22,256
Yes, I will.

1415
01:35:24,838 --> 01:35:28,270
I don't think I'm going 
to get to meet her.

1416
01:35:31,353 --> 01:35:34,012
I'm so sorry.

1417
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:40,153
Don't say that.

1418
01:35:42,007 --> 01:35:44,757
If anyone can make it, you can.

1419
01:35:44,782 --> 01:35:46,421
Remember.

1420
01:35:50,181 --> 01:35:52,155
I love you.

1421
01:35:53,420 --> 01:35:56,666
Please don't worry too much.

1422
01:36:02,396 --> 01:36:05,039
Good bye, my love.

1423
01:36:18,142 --> 01:36:20,597
I love you, Rob.

1424
01:36:24,088 --> 01:36:25,912
I love you.

1425
01:38:08,692 --> 01:38:12,360
(Come on.)
(Come on.)

1426
01:38:25,870 --> 01:38:28,188
(Come on, Dad.)

1427
01:39:49,626 --> 01:39:51,289
Beck.

1428
01:39:54,335 --> 01:39:56,544
Helen, it's Mike here.

1429
01:39:56,690 --> 01:39:58,911
Helen, do you copy?

1430
01:39:58,936 --> 01:40:00,737
Mike, come in.

1431
01:40:00,762 --> 01:40:02,586
Beck's still alive.

1432
01:40:02,611 --> 01:40:04,749
He walked himself into camp.

1433
01:40:04,774 --> 01:40:07,219

1434
01:40:07,244 --> 01:40:10,162
I got to get him down to Camp 1.

1435
01:40:11,501 --> 01:40:13,382
Thanks, Mike.

1436
01:40:17,065 --> 01:40:21,259
We don't even know how,
but he is alive.

1437
01:40:21,529 --> 01:40:23,174
Thing is, Peach,

1438
01:40:23,199 --> 01:40:24,950
we can't get him down the Icefall.

1439
01:40:24,975 --> 01:40:26,427
Oh no.
I'll get him down.

1440
01:40:26,452 --> 01:40:28,645
- I'll get him down. Okay.
- Dad.

1441
01:40:28,670 --> 01:40:31,669
Okay, what do we need?
We need a helicopter, right?

1442
01:40:31,694 --> 01:40:36,662
Yeah, but they can't a helicopter up 
that high because the air is too thin.

1443
01:40:36,687 --> 01:40:39,659
We should try, but it is 
one heck of a rescue.

1444
01:40:39,684 --> 01:40:41,545
And he's not in a
 good way, Peach.  So...

1445
01:40:41,570 --> 01:40:44,499
I don't want you to get 
your hopes up too high.

1446
01:40:49,335 --> 01:40:51,131
1 step at a time.

1447
01:40:54,361 --> 01:40:55,602
- You got to keep moving.
- I'm tired.

1448
01:40:55,627 --> 01:40:57,059
- I know.
- I'm tired.

1449
01:40:57,084 --> 01:40:59,496
I know you are.
I know you are. Come on.

1450
01:41:01,208 --> 01:41:03,098
Slow and steady.

1451
01:41:04,482 --> 01:41:06,607
Come on, keep moving.

1452
01:41:06,968 --> 01:41:11,567
Yes, I like the number of the 
American Embassy in Kathmandu, Nepal.

1453
01:41:11,722 --> 01:41:12,840
Yes, Nepal.

1454
01:41:12,865 --> 01:41:15,389
Ambassador, please.
No. Sweets, I can't hold.

1455
01:41:15,414 --> 01:41:16,606
No. 
You listen, sir.

1456
01:41:16,631 --> 01:41:19,629
My husband has already died once
as you've seen on the news.

1457
01:41:19,654 --> 01:41:24,008
Trust me. Having him die a second
time is not going to play well on CNN.

1458
01:41:24,148 --> 01:41:26,554
There we go, buddy.

1459
01:41:27,112 --> 01:41:29,492
That's it, alright.

1460
01:41:30,245 --> 01:41:33,375
Camp 2

1461
01:41:34,060 --> 01:41:36,478
- Beck.
- Uh-huh.

1462
01:41:37,273 --> 01:41:38,405
How're you doing?

1463
01:41:38,430 --> 01:41:41,170
Oh, you know,
third amendment.

1464
01:41:41,462 --> 01:41:43,033
Warm enough?

1465
01:41:43,862 --> 01:41:45,839
I'm not sure yet.

1466
01:41:46,270 --> 01:41:48,489
Look like you are,
a little bit.

1467
01:41:50,715 --> 01:41:52,721
How's Rob doing?

1468
01:41:55,433 --> 01:41:58,152
Rob's still up there right now.

1469
01:42:00,330 --> 01:42:02,917
And Doug, 
what's he up to?

1470
01:42:07,531 --> 01:42:09,497
Doug's gone, Beck.

1471
01:42:25,362 --> 01:42:28,049
I don't know. No one's ever try 
to fly higher than Base Camp before.

1472
01:42:28,074 --> 01:42:29,973
They gonna give it a go.

1473
01:42:29,998 --> 01:42:32,487
Just find an LZ. Just make up 
with whatever you can.

1474
01:42:32,512 --> 01:42:34,162
Okay.
Worth a try.

1475
01:42:34,201 --> 01:42:35,580
Thanks, Guy.

1476
01:42:35,607 --> 01:42:37,473
Grab a Gatorade.
Got a chopper coming in.

1477
01:42:37,498 --> 01:42:39,089
We need to make a LZ

1478
01:42:39,114 --> 01:42:41,692
We got a chopper coming in!

1479
01:42:42,347 --> 01:42:44,915
- Clear the rope back to the tents!
- Okay.

1480
01:42:44,940 --> 01:42:46,001
Thanks.

1481
01:42:46,026 --> 01:42:48,616
Keep it clear.
Keep this whole area clear.

1482
01:42:49,261 --> 01:42:50,901
Come on.
Come on.

1483
01:43:05,792 --> 01:43:07,866
You can't pause zipping.

1484
01:43:08,239 --> 01:43:10,926
You land here, 
we'll never get back up.

1485
01:43:17,156 --> 01:43:19,454
Okay, Major, let's go back.

1486
01:43:37,930 --> 01:43:40,161
- That's it.
- Can't get any more out.

1487
01:43:40,186 --> 01:43:42,352
it's as light as 
we're going to get it.

1488
01:43:43,459 --> 01:43:46,220
- Tango to Charlie.
- Tango to Charlie.

1489
01:43:57,149 --> 01:43:59,463
Right here!
Right here!

1490
01:44:01,580 --> 01:44:04,100
Come on!
Come closer!

1491
01:44:32,344 --> 01:44:33,713
Come, Beck.

1492
01:44:33,738 --> 01:44:35,279
Right there.

1493
01:44:38,156 --> 01:44:39,918
Okay.
Come on.

1494
01:44:42,519 --> 01:44:43,691
Get closer.

1495
01:44:43,716 --> 01:44:46,462
- Only 1 hand, sir.
- Just hand, just 1.

1496
01:44:46,487 --> 01:44:49,051
- Alright.
- There you go.

1497
01:44:52,319 --> 01:44:53,769
You good?

1498
01:44:54,098 --> 01:44:57,270
I'm going to lift the tail up.
Flies over the edge.

1499
01:44:57,442 --> 01:44:59,563

1500
01:44:59,588 --> 01:45:01,858
- Is that okay with you?
- I'm with you.

1501
01:45:01,883 --> 01:45:03,678
Good, man.

1502
01:46:10,270 --> 01:46:12,489
It's alright.

1503
01:46:18,011 --> 01:46:20,506
I'm so sorry, Helen.

1504
01:46:20,925 --> 01:46:23,293
Come on.
Let's get you inside.

1505
01:46:44,886 --> 01:46:46,690
Hi, Peachy.

1506
01:46:51,242 --> 01:46:52,672
Beck.

1507
01:47:05,428 --> 01:47:07,829
Thank you so much, darling.

1508
01:47:28,213 --> 01:47:30,560
Oh, Jan.
I'm so sorry.

1509
01:47:59,071 --> 01:48:08,229
Rob's body remains on the mountain

He still lives in Dallas with his wife, Peach.
