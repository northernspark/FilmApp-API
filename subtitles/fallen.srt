00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,400
I want to tell you about the time
I almost died.

3
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,000
I never thought it would happen to me.

4
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,520
Not at this age.

5
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,080
Beaten...

6
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,720
...outsmarted.

7
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,280
How did I get into this fix?
How did it all begin?

8
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,400
If I go back to the beginning
that'll take forever.

9
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,000
So, let's start more recently.

10
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,040
Somewhere.

11
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,640
Anywhere.

12
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,240
Reese.

13
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,640
I thought the governor
didn't approve of this.

14
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,000
The more they don't approve,
the more they want to watch.

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,240
So what is this, six notches on your belt?

16
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,520
Eight.

17
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,080
Congratulations.

18
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,280
Fuck you.

19
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,200
Ask me more nicely, huh?

20
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,560
John Hobbes.

21
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,840
You're wanted in the dance hall.

22
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,240
Edgar Reese.

23
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,400
Well, well, well.

24
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,000
Look who's here.

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,560
It's the brilliant detective
who sealed my brutish fate.

26
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,840
That's right.

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So, what's this?
They're making you famous now?

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,760
Big time. They're gonna put me
in the movies. Documentary.

29
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,200
All courtesy of the ACLU.
They'll shoot me getting smoked.

30
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,880
Who knows?
Maybe it'll be a big video rental.

31
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,560
All these society ladies showing it
to their dinner guests:

32
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,520
"You see that there?
That's a urine stain, ladies."

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,840
"Oh, my, it's not urine."

34
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,400
It's good to see you, Hobbes.

35
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,560
It's good to be seen by you, Reese.

36
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,560
You're...

37
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,040
...my best pal.

38
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,760
You're still a good fella.

39
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,360
Open the gate.

40
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,640
You remind me of somebody, Hobbes.

41
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,760
Indeed you do.

42
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,360
Indeed you do.

43
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,760
Do you like riddles?

44
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,040
No, I don't.

45
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,040
Here's a beaut.

46
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,280
Why is there...

47
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,520
...a space between Lyons and Spakowsky?

48
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,160
What?

49
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,840
Come on. You should know this one, pal.
You should know this one.

50
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,360
Open your eyes. Look around sometime.

51
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,600
Open the gate.

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,520
Remember this, Hobbes.

53
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,520
A day...

54
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,360
...a week, a month.

55
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,640
What are you, a Nazi now?

56
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,880
It's Dutch.

57
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,840
What goes around...

58
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,360
...really goes around.

59
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,440
You have a safe trip.

60
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,520
I'll be looking for you.

61
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,200
What goes around really goes around.

62
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,680
Howdy, folks.

63
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,440
Ladies, gents...

64
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,480
...cocksuckers, pederasts...

65
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,600
...l hope you all enjoy the show. Yes, I do.

66
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,560
I'll give you a blowjob
if you get me out of this baby.

67
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,600
"Time

68
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,080
"ls on my side

69
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,600
"Yes, it is

70
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,280
"Time

71
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,520
"ls on my side

72
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,640
"Yes, it is

73
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,000
"Now, you always say

74
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,440
"That you want to be free

75
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,520
"But I'll come running back

76
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,960
"l'll come running back to you"

77
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,640
Baby, come on, go ahead...

78
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,560
...light up my life!

79
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,520
Something is always happening.

80
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,960
But when it happens,
people don't always see it...

81
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,960
...or understand it...

82
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,000
...or accept it.

83
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,520
The criminals don't accept consequences.

84
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,080
They kill. It's not their fault.
This is the consequence of what I do.

85
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,480
-Look who made it. How'd it go?
-Mr. Consequence.

86
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,480
-He died.
-I told you.

87
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,880
Get one more.

88
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,480
Nice to see you.

89
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,120
How you doing, Gracie?

90
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,160
-Don't tempt me with that.
-Sorry.

91
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,320
What's your poison? We got some Becks.

92
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,800
We got some Guinness.
We got some Bass.

93
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,920
-Budweiser's good for me.
-Budweiser?

94
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,960
-Yeah.
-Good.

95
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,920
No, we're going imported here.

96
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,480
-If you can't afford it, I'll buy.
-I can afford it. Budweiser.

97
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,720
At least have a Bud lce
or a Bud Dry or something.

98
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,080
It is just a Bud, okay?

99
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,800
-You guys want anything?
-No.

100
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,000
Here's your Bud.

101
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,520
He was one of the most notorious inmates.

102
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,760
Here you go.

103
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,400
Thank you, sweetheart.

104
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,400
You're an unusual cop, Hobbes.

105
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,440
Really?

106
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,760
I've been in this precinct about what,
five, six months?

107
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,240
Everybody says,
"Hobbes don't take no cream."

108
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,160
"Hobbes don't take no cream."

109
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,040
Now is that true, or what?

110
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,240
No, I don't like cream.

111
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,600
That means "no"?

112
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,880
Yeah, it means "no."

113
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,480
Now, is that "no" as in "never,"
"no" as in "sometimes"...

114
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,400
...or "no" as in "l do,
but I don't like to talk about it"?

115
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,960
"No" as in "never."

116
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,000
This is a big city, Hobbesy.

117
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,640
We got a tradition to uphold.

118
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,960
Got something wrong with your ears?
When the man says something, he says it.

119
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,080
This is hypothetical:

120
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,400
A cop who's trying to make ends meet
wants a little something on the side....

121
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,920
I don't like cream...

122
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,520
...and I don't judge.

123
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,960
You don't judge?

124
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,800
He's a fucking saint, huh?

125
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,440
So you're telling me
that under no circumstances...

126
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,080
...would a holy man like you ever,
you know...

127
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,400
...break the law or do something....

128
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,720
Look, Lou...

129
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,240
...l could jump across the table,
snatch your heart out of your chest...

130
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,040
...squeeze the blood out,
and stick it in your front pocket.

131
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,120
Oh, yeah?

132
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,800
If I lost control. But if I did...

133
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,920
...l'd be no different
than the people we bust.

134
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,840
Now, as to your general question....

135
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,880
You take any cop on the force,
cream or no...

136
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,920
...ninety-nine percent of the time
they're doing their job, aren't they?

137
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,960
Ninety-nine five.

138
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,320
Point five.

139
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,760
So he or she, cream or no...

140
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,240
...is doing more good out there every day...

141
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,560
...than any lawyer or a stockbroker or...

142
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,480
...President of the United States
can ever do in their lifetime.

143
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,920
Cops are the "chosen people."

144
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,080
Amen.

145
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,320
Guess I'm switching to Bud.

146
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,200
Gracie, come here and get this foreign shit
off my table...

147
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,000
...and bring me three Buds.

148
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,760
Damn it, what took you so long?

149
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,360
You know what you'd look like
with this sandwich up your ass?

150
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,200
Pardon me?

151
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,600
Like a fat, stupid fuck
with a sandwich up his ass.

152
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,720
Charles, I hate to do this, but....

153
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,960
Put the job where the sandwich goes.

154
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,840
Hello?

155
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,600
Hello?

156
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,080
Hello?

157
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,800
Here we go. Juice, pretzels...

158
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,440
...apple....

159
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,920
Peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

160
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,520
Uncle John, will you please
make my lunch tomorrow?

161
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,720
Here's Toby.

162
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,640
I can't be having the same thing every day.

163
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,600
What do you want,
peanut butter and jelly sandwich?

164
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,840
Jelly and peanut butter?

165
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,720
I love you, Dad.

166
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,040
Don't forget your Uncle Johnny.

167
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,520
I can feel the love in this room, man.

168
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,840
-Bye.
-Be good.

169
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,280
-Have a good day at school.
-Okay. Bye.

170
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,480
You're doing a good job, Art.

171
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,720
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

172
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,640
Why don't you sit down with me?
Let's talk a bit.

173
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,920
You're not in a hurry?

174
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,720
No, no....

175
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,520
I can relax today.

176
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,160
Besides, what are they going to do?
Fire me?

177
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,200
-How're you doing?
-Okay.

178
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,040
-You're all right?
-Yeah.

179
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,320
I love you, Johnny.

180
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,600
You ever think it would be easier,
your life would be easier...

181
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,520
...if maybe me and Sam
were not living with--

182
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,000
No, no.

183
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,880
-Maybe Marcy wouldn't have left.
-Later for Marcy.

184
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,680
If she loved me, she would've never left.

185
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,560
Besides, family's always first.
You're my brother.

186
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,840
I love you, too.

187
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,840
But don't make the boy any more
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

188
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,240
-No more peanut butter and jelly.
-Okay.

189
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,320
A cop knows.

190
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,080
A cop sees.

191
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,200
Even the most casual thing, it registers.

192
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,920
Often you don't remember till later on.
But then...

193
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,360
...you look back and you realize...

194
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,280
...you knew.

195
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,520
Good morning, Detective.

196
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,800
How're you doing, Lieutenant?

197
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,560
Look who's feeling good today.

198
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,520
Hey, what can I say?
You're looking better than me.

199
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,520
Got a call on four, Hobbes.

200
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,360
Thank you, Denise. Jonesy?

201
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,880
How's everything today? Good?

202
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,400
Detective Hobbes.

203
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,040
Pal, you got a pen?

204
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,080
4541...

205
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,320
...South Stender, Apartment 2.

206
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,040
Who's there?

207
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,880
A clue, Magoo.

208
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,800
Couldn't sleep last night.

209
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,000
Who can?

210
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,880
Remember I used to get calls at two or
three o'clock in the morning from Reese?

211
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,720
He loved you. He truly did.

212
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,880
Somebody called me last night.

213
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,440
Imagine that.

214
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,800
-Denise?
-Yeah?

215
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,400
Send a car to 4541 South Stender,
Apartment 2.

216
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,000
Make sure we gain entry.

217
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,080
Got a body?

218
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,320
No, it's probably just some knucklehead,
saw me on TV, trying to impress his girl.

219
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,320
-How'd I look last night?
-Fabulous.

220
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,160
You saw that? Four different channels.

221
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,080
You're a god. You're a god.

222
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,880
Name's Muskavich. Russian expatriate.

223
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,640
Super says no family,
no friends, no nothing.

224
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,600
Why is he dead, then?

225
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,640
What've you got?

226
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,200
I've got puncture wounds.

227
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,200
Look for a syringe, or something.

228
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,760
Eighteen.

229
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,800
-What's that, his eighteenth victim?
-Could be.

230
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,880
Could be.

231
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,080
Very tidy.

232
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,160
The DOA's been dead awhile,
so what the hell is this?

233
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,600
Killer slept over and then...

234
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,680
...had a nice, neat breakfast.

235
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,040
Looks like it.

236
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,160
Check this out.

237
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,280
Shit.

238
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,720
What?

239
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,160
It's a riddle.

240
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,960
Reese, in his cell before he died,
he asked me, "Why is there a space...

241
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,120
"...between Lyons and Spakowsky?"

242
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,960
Yeah?

243
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,120
Accomplice?

244
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,520
Reese had an accomplice?

245
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,360
Unless it's a copycat. Maybe the...

246
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,880
...prison guards or the people
that made that documentary.

247
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,080
-You got a minute?
-I'll be there in a second.

248
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,920
Fifty people must have seen
that documentary by now.

249
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,080
Me and Jonesy will run them down.

250
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,280
Yeah, good.

251
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,520
Fingerprint. Perp wore no gloves.

252
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,160
Left prints on the spoon and cereal bowl
like he was advertising.

253
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,360
Maybe his prints aren't in the system.

254
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,480
I hate to be stupid...

255
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,840
Enjoy it, Lou.

256
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,320
...but is motive still something
we think about...

257
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,640
...or is it that all these crimes
are done out of sickness?

258
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,040
Number 2.

259
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,640
Everything is motive.

260
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,520
Sickness is motive.

261
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,800
Sharp.

262
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,600
The coroner's prelim on the Ruski.

263
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,080
Isn't that the wacko poison
that Reese used on them Arab kids?

264
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,800
-Tiff?
-Yeah?

265
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,560
You like riddles? You know,
puzzles and shit? Brainteasers?

266
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,640
Sure, as long as I'm doing the teasing.

267
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,720
Why is there a space
between Lyons and Spakowsky?

268
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,480
What does that even mean? Come on!

269
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,280
We had a Spakowsky in my rookie year.

270
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,640
South Precinct.

271
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,080
Come again?

272
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,400
Not your Spakowsky. This guy's a cop.

273
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,840
Keep talking.

274
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,880
The guy's a fucking asshole.

275
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,000
He's the King Kong of assholes.
He's a fucking legend.

276
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,360
His name's up on the wall.

277
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,200
What?

278
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,040
Some chief in the '30s
thought it would boost morale.

279
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,480
They kept it up until '81 or '82,
and it got to be like a booby prize.

280
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,480
It was downtown in the lobby...
till they remodeled.

281
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,640
Must've passed it by 1,000 times.

282
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,240
I guess I need to open my eyes
and look around sometime.

283
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,680
Lyons, I don't remember him,
but Spakowsky, he was around.

284
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,360
This guy was so fucking mean
that his wife shot him in the foot.

285
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,800
Who was '65?

286
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,320
Who was in that space?

287
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,360
You got me, bud. I don't know.

288
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,720
You're saying they took a name off?
Why would they do that?

289
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,720
I don't know. I called Records.
They say they don't know who it was...

290
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,360
...and they don't know why it's not there.

291
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,120
We'd better find out.

292
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,120
Lieutenant, just the man I wanted to see.

293
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,000
"Robert Milano."

294
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,280
That's right.

295
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,920
Cop of the Year, 1965.

296
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,920
Eight months later, goes up to a cabin,
middle of nowhere, dies cleaning his gun.

297
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,080
So it's either two things:
He was dirty or it was a woman.

298
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,440
What?

299
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,000
I met him once...Milano.

300
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,480
He had a poker up his ass,
but otherwise he was a good cop.

301
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,280
-What I want to know is--
-I know what you want.

302
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,320
I can't help you.

303
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,160
Can't help me?

304
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,600
Look...

305
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,640
...do all of us a favor, okay?

306
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,840
Whatever you find out...

307
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,680
...keep it to yourself.

308
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,760
I got something for you.

309
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,840
Documentary on Reese.

310
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,560
Thank you. You're a real white man.

311
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,120
Jonesy.

312
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,360
-Tape on Reese. You want to view it?
-Give me a sec.

313
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,360
What do you got on Muskavich?

314
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,800
Fingerprints were bust.

315
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,520
The crime scene says
the killer probably had dark hair.

316
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,960
He probably was left-handed.

317
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,600
Yeah, like Reese.

318
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,560
He had bad teeth.
Found a piece in the corn flakes.

319
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,960
Directory Assistance.

320
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,760
Can you give me a number on a Milano...

321
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,440
...Sylvia M-l-L-A-N-O.

322
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,760
Hold, please.

323
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,360
Hey, Lieutenant.

324
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,920
Excuse me, Boss.

325
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:42,400
If somebody dies because you kept
your mouth shut, you're holding the bag.

326
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,120
When it's a perfect world, let me know.

327
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,800
In the meantime,
it's not me keeping his mouth shut.

328
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,160
-Is that clear enough for you?
-Yeah.

329
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,040
I'm sorry. There's no listing.

330
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,360
Okay, thanks. No, listen, listen.
You still there? Hello?

331
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,760
Check and see if there's a G. Milano,
a Gretta Milano. Can you do that for me?

332
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,880
-Hold, please.
-Thanks.

333
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,800
Syringe had the same prints.

334
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,600
-So now what? Video time?
-Yeah.

335
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,320
You know, I was thinking....

336
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,720
Don't hurt yourself.

337
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,760
Eat me.

338
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,360
Hold for the number.

339
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,640
Whoever did Muskavich,
knew the poison that Reese used.

340
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,640
He quotes Reese. He could be a cop.

341
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,360
He could be, huh?

342
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,360
Lou, could be a cop, huh?

343
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,760
Please leave a message. Thank you.

344
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,200
Make sure Hobbes gets a copy of this.

345
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,960
Are you watching, Johnny-boy?
I hope you're paying close attention.

346
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,480
Every gesture!

347
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,760
Every word!

348
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,400
Wait a second.

349
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,520
What?

350
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,120
Check something out.

351
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,280
That...

352
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,520
...language he was speaking...

353
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,800
...later.

354
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,280
That's Dutch?

355
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,640
That's what he said.

356
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,560
What's he speaking now? ls that Dutch?

357
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,640
This now?

358
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,680
This is mumbo-jumbo, gibberish.

359
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,960
You sure on that?

360
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,280
Who is it?

361
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,840
It's Detective John Hobbes.
I'm looking for Miss Gretta Milano.

362
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,480
-Oh, yes. You left a message.
-Yes.

363
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,760
I wanted to talk to you about your father.

364
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,960
How're you doing?

365
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,000
May I come in?

366
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,480
Sure.

367
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,560
You're surrounded by angels.

368
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,680
I teach theology at the university.

369
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,080
I see. Very beautiful.

370
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,360
Thank you.

371
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,600
Why do you want to know
about my father?

372
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,120
It's 30 years later and the files are sealed...

373
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,600
...and my boss was told to let it alone, so...

374
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,760
...here I am.

375
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,640
I can tell you what my mother told me
before she died.

376
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,440
Why do you want to know?
Just curious, or...?

377
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,520
No, ma'am.

378
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,760
See, I'm the detective
who caught Edgar Reese.

379
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,760
I'm not sure if you're familiar with him.
He was just executed.

380
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,480
-Yeah, I read about him.
-Right.

381
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,120
And this Reese fella, he...

382
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,080
...in a roundabout way,
gave me your father's name.

383
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,360
Did Reese like to sing?

384
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,440
Yeah, he did, actually.

385
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,600
And at the execution,
did he try and touch you or grab you?

386
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,040
Yeah, he did. He shook my hand.

387
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,080
Do you want some coffee?

388
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,280
Sure.

389
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,120
One condition:

390
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,200
You and I never spoke.

391
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,280
You say nothing to your boss or partner.
Nothing goes in the files.

392
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,800
My name and everything I say
is just between us. Agreed?

393
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,360
Will I get a cup of coffee if I say yes?

394
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,320
Detective, my dad was a good cop.

395
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,360
"Pride of the force" and all that.
And then he shot himself.

396
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,720
A reporter found out
my father had been under investigation.

397
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,000
He'd caught a killer,
but copycat crimes started.

398
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,360
Evidence mounted up against him:
fingerprints, witnesses.

399
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,520
The press never got real proof,
but my father's medal was rescinded.

400
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,720
I see.

401
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:06,840
So you're saying that when he died
someone made this evidence go away?

402
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,920
The mayor, the governor and
the chief of police, they all needed a hero.

403
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,240
Some of these people are
still important today.

404
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,800
-I see.
-No. Not yet, you don't.

405
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,520
My father saw the evidence against him,
told my mother he couldn't beat it.

406
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,240
So, he went to this cabin in the mountains.

407
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,760
It's a place that's been
in my mother's family for generations.

408
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,520
He went there and....

409
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,720
The thing is...

410
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,680
...l know my father was innocent
of those murders.

411
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,560
How do you know?

412
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,560
How do you know he was innocent?

413
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,520
It was 30 years ago.
It's not important anymore.

414
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,640
It's important to me, Miss Milano.

415
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,040
Don't you want the truth to come out,
the killer to be punished?

416
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,320
-Of course, I do.
-But?

417
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,640
Are you afraid that if you tell me
your life may be in danger?

418
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,880
Yeah.

419
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,200
That's it?

420
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,040
Yes.

421
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,800
Okay.

422
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,680
Okay.

423
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,360
Thank you very much.

424
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,560
-For the coffee as well.
-Okay.

425
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,880
Oh, listen....

426
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,520
If I have any more questions,
can I call you?

427
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,480
I'd rather you didn't.

428
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,960
Detective....

429
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,040
Do you believe in God?

430
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,480
Yeah. I go to church every now and then.

431
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,040
What I see in my line of work...

432
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,440
...faith's a little hard to sustain.

433
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,520
Good luck.

434
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,920
Sometimes I think the basicjob
that human beings have...

435
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,960
...isjust to figure out
what the hell is going on.

436
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,360
Example: Gretta Milano.

437
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,880
What was she hiding?
What was she so scared of?.

438
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,800
And then her question about God.
What the hell is that all about?

439
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,400
You never know.
Down to the smallest thing.

440
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,720
The man who passes you
and catches your eye. Does he know you?

441
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,200
Did you go to school together? ls he a
homicidal maniac who hates you on sight?

442
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,160
Or is it nothing?

443
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,640
Nothing at all.

444
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,240
Wake up.

445
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,960
Go to bed.

446
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,560
I know. I know.

447
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,560
Here we go. Up. Up.

448
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,040
I'm going, Uncle John.

449
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,640
Hello?

450
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,000
Hello?

451
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,280
Let's go, Sam.

452
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,080
Good night.

453
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,560
Good night, son.

454
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,720
-Johnny?
-Yeah?

455
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,960
Do you ever get scared?

456
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,360
Yeah, sometimes.

457
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,000
Me, too.

458
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,680
Good night, Art.

459
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,520
-Hello?
-Mrs. Moohr? This is Charles.

460
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,640
Apparently, I must have gotten drunk
or something...

461
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,800
...because the last few days....

462
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,080
Am I working tonight?

463
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,360
You quit.

464
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,160
I quit?

465
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,400
Yes. You insulted Harry
and he hired someone else.

466
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,480
But.... I mean.... How...?

467
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,800
Look, I'm really sorry....

468
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,240
Could you apologize, please,
to your husband for whatever--

469
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,880
We always liked you, Charles. Goodbye.

470
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,320
Hello?

471
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,160
Well, well, well. Look who's here.

472
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,840
I played Reese's tape on the phone
to a linguist. He's coming down.

473
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,080
Yeah? Prelim?

474
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,960
Said it sounded Mideastern.

475
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,200
-Anything on Muskavich?
-Only the pizza.

476
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,560
Now, we're hitting
your area of expertise, huh?

477
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,560
Pizza is a staff of life.

478
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,760
Without pizza and other fine ltalian foods,
there would be no happiness.

479
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,440
There was one slice left:

480
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,000
Garlic, linguica and pineapple.

481
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,040
Plus, there was nothing
in Muskavich's stomach.

482
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,400
So it was the killer's eats.

483
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,280
Hell of a clue. You better write
that one up for the journal.

484
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,280
I will, Lou. And I will laud you copiously.

485
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,680
Thank you.

486
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,840
Detectives? Your guy's in Video.

487
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,720
The linguist guy's here.

488
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,760
I'll be right there.

489
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,200
Any luck?

490
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,640
John Hobbes, Professor Richard Louders.

491
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,360
-How do you do?
-Pleasure.

492
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,360
This is completely exhilarating.

493
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,880
Who is this convict? Can I speak to him?

494
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,000
Not now. Have a seat.

495
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,840
Professor says it's a language.
He's just never heard it spoken aloud.

496
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,840
-Meaning?
-Some kind of antique.

497
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:43,160
I believe this is a Biblical tongue:
Syrian Aramaic.

498
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,800
Only a few nomadic tribes still use it.

499
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,440
So you don't know what he's saying?

500
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,160
I haven't the faintest.

501
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,120
He's not too pleasant, is he?

502
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,720
But if you'd spare me a copy,
I'd be more than happy to work it.

503
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,480
I'd appreciate it. If you could wait out front
for 15 minutes...

504
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,320
...we'll dupe one off for you.

505
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,680
I'll be waiting.

506
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,320
-See you in a minute.
-'Bye, Detective.

507
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,240
-Syrian Aramaic.
-Imagine that.

508
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,520
I got something else, too.
I'm looking up this clipping...

509
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,960
...of Reese, high-school baseball team.

510
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,080
He bats right.

511
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,320
He throws right.

512
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,720
What are you saying, Hobbes?

513
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,080
Reese pulled off some of the sickest shit
on record.

514
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:34,400
He speaks a language 2,000 years old and
you're worried 'cause he's ambidextrous?

515
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,040
I'm worried about everything.

516
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,640
-Hobbes, call on Line 1 .
-Thank you, Bill.

517
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,400
Detective Hobbes.

518
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,720
Hey, pal, need another clue?

519
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,360
1339 South Grove...

520
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,000
...Apartment 9.

521
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,680
Jonesy, that pizza place
with the number 17?

522
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,960
Is that close to Grove?

523
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,360
I think so.

524
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,720
They're in the same place...

525
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,920
...exactly.

526
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,000
-It's like he's laughing at us.
-He is.

527
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,880
Cash, not a check?

528
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,320
That's right.

529
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,600
Take a look at this.

530
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,200
What the hell is this?

531
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,880
You know what's scary?

532
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,200
I'm going home last night, this guy's
walking past me, he's going the other way.

533
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,760
He looks me right in the eye.

534
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,000
The kind of look like he knows you.
You know what I mean?

535
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,680
It's the same guy that's in the bathtub.

536
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,400
-The stiff.
-You're shitting me.

537
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,200
I shit you not. Same guy.

538
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,280
Oh, man.

539
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,440
I ain't smart enough to figure this out.

540
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,640
Me, neither.

541
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,240
Found under the sink.

542
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,360
Same poison?

543
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,000
Same poison.
Better get that down to the lab.

544
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,120
-What else have you got?
-The number on his chest.

545
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,680
Last Thursday it's 18, now it's 2?

546
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,720
Everything's under a Charles Olom,
but it looks like that's an alias.

547
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,920
So, we're running his prints.

548
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,520
To quote Yogi Berra ,
"lt's like deja vu all over again."

549
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,240
-You mean Reese?
-Yeah.

550
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,520
Whoever is doing it...

551
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,920
...has a thing for Hobbes.

552
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,280
Seems like.

553
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,120
How is he?

554
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,520
Who, Hobbes?

555
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,960
How is he ever? He's fine. He's great.

556
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,200
If it starts to work at him,
let me know, okay?

557
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,200
And if it starts to work on me,
I'll let you know.

558
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,160
I thought that was you.

559
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,880
What are you doing, more...

560
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,600
...historical research?

561
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,960
Nice talking to you. See you Monday.

562
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,640
All right, Lou.

563
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,000
Come on, Jimmy.

564
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,440
Over here, shoot it!

565
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,120
Shoot it, shoot it!

566
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,320
Come on, come on, Sam. Okay.

567
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,640
That's okay, that's okay.

568
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,160
Score is tied.

569
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,080
No, 19 to 17.

570
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,880
You can take him.

571
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,640
Pass the ball. I'm open.

572
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,320
Take the ball back.

573
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,960
Johnny's going to make a point.
He's got the ball.

574
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,000
-Hi, Art.
-How're you doing?

575
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,480
Good one! Three, two, one!

576
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,080
That's it for me. I've gotta go.

577
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,320
No, I've gotta go. I have a long drive.

578
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,640
Art, get in here.

579
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,760
Uncle John, but he's a spaz.

580
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,440
You don't disrespect your father, okay?
You understand me?

581
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,120
Cherish what you got.

582
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,560
Get on in there.

583
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,600
-Want to come with us?
-I didn't bring my shoes.

584
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,640
Come on.

585
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,880
What's up?

586
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,280
-Tiffany didn't get you?
-No, what's up?

587
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,400
You know how weird this case is?

588
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,560
We got a positive l.D...

589
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,640
...on Charles Olom.

590
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,200
Real name's Mickey Noons.

591
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,640
Born in Canada, illegal alien.

592
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,200
Blah, blah, blah. Smalltime shithead.

593
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,760
That ain't bad.

594
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,120
That ain't it.

595
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,040
Noons killed the Ruski. It's his prints
all over Muskavich's apartment.

596
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,160
What?

597
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,240
Let's see, Noons poisons Muskavich...

598
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,360
...dumps him in the tub,
sets out the corn flakes.

599
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,280
Three days later somebody does
the exact same thing to him.

600
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,800
"Exact," because Noons and Muskavich
were killed by the same person.

601
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,240
Some kind of ringmaster?

602
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,600
I think so.

603
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,600
Hey, Art. You and Sam don't forget lunch,
all right?

604
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,960
I don't know.
I can't seem to get my mind around it.

605
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,640
I got a bad feeling about this.

606
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,880
Me, too.

607
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,520
Somebody's playing with my dick
and it ain't me.

608
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,640
-Yeah. See you.
-'Bye.

609
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,400
-Ten minutes, Art!
-Okay.

610
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,920
There are moments which mark your life.

611
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:38,360
Moments when you realize
nothing will ever be the same.

612
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,640
And time is divided into two parts:

613
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,000
Before this...

614
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,960
...and after this.

615
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,920
Sometimes you can feel
such a moment coming.

616
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,880
That's the test...or so I tell myself.

617
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,880
I tell myself that at times like that...

618
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:29,000
...strong people keep moving forward,
anyway...

619
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,720
...no matter what they're going to find.

620
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,160
-Miss Milano.
-Oh, hello.

621
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,400
I went to your family's place
in the mountains.

622
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,800
-Beautiful, isn't it?
-Yes, it is.

623
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,520
Let me get that for you.

624
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,440
Trees and the water....

625
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,120
Absolutely beautiful.
What does "Azazel" mean?

626
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:02,200
Your father wrote it in the basement
on the wall, then he painted over it.

627
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,200
My dictionary...

628
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,120
...says that it's "the...

629
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,800
"...evil spirit of the wilderness."

630
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,400
Whatever that means.

631
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,240
One of the books your father had up there
talks about demons...

632
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,240
...and how they move by touch.

633
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,920
Walk away, Mr. Hobbes.

634
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,280
-Say again?
-If you enjoy your life...

635
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:22,240
...if there's even one human being
you care about, don't take this case.

636
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,200
It's out of my hands, Miss Milano.
I mean, it's my job.

637
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,480
'Bye, Mr. Hobbes.

638
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:35,720
That's it?

639
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,240
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

640
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,080
-Fax.
-Thanks.

641
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,640
Phone company sent MUDs and LUDs
for Noons' and Muskavich's apartments.

642
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,400
See those calls there?

643
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,600
They were made right around
the time they were killed.

644
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,720
You're saying the killer called me
from the crime scene?

645
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,880
Sure looks like it.

646
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,600
-Reese used to call me at night.
-Reese is dead.

647
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,280
Whoever's doing this
is in league with Reese...

648
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,920
...or was imitating Reese.
I know he's still calling my house.

649
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,400
How many times have I got to change
my phone number?

650
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,320
The more you change it, the more it looks
like someone on the inside.

651
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,640
Like a cop?

652
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,360
Yeah.

653
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,640
It's nothing to me...

654
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,840
...but the egos upstairs....

655
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,240
-You hear me?
-Both ears.

656
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:47,520
I'm going to lose my sense of humor.
What've you got?

657
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,720
A translation from the Aramaic:

658
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,960
"l can't enter you by touch.

659
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:55,800
"But even when I can get inside you,
after I'm spirit, I won't.

660
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,520
"l'll fuck you up and down, left and right."
That's in the Bible.

661
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,680
"lf that doesn't work, I have other ways."

662
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,200
We need a translation of the translation.

663
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,240
Anything else?

664
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,600
No, I'm okay. Thanks.

665
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,120
I like the night.

666
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,560
The street.

667
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,160
The smells.

668
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,680
The sense of another world.

669
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,800
Sometimes you come
face to face with yourself.

670
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,080
Now...

671
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,680
...put that card back in.

672
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,480
-Anywhere.
-All right.

673
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,360
-Tell me when to stop, okay?
-Okay.

674
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,680
Can you pronounce it for me again?

675
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,840
Okay, Professor, I think I got it.
All right...'bye.

676
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:44,160
I can get inside you.
After I'm spirit, I won't.

677
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:45,600
No.

678
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,680
Better I get you for real.

679
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:49,880
Fuck you...

680
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:52,960
...up, down, left, right, coming, going....

681
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,600
I'll get so close to you...

682
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,000
...so close it breaks you.

683
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,360
And if that doesn't work...

684
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,360
...well, I have other ways.

685
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,560
I have so many...

686
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,960
...many ways.

687
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:25,800
Right.

688
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,360
Fifteen minutes.

689
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,360
Hi. Can I help you?

690
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,760
You're releasing a Richard Suckle?

691
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:40,560
-He called a cab.
-I'll have him brought right down.

692
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,440
-Looking good today.
-Thanks.

693
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,040
Rap sheet on Bobby Stiggers.

694
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,200
Thank you.

695
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,760
Hobbesy, tell me something.

696
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,760
Shoot.

697
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,960
The other day you were
in the basement reading an old file.

698
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,040
What about it?

699
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:17,040
Looked like a map in there.
Are you going somewhere?

700
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:18,920
I went up to the country.

701
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,760
It's great to get out of town.

702
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:22,720
Lovely. Fresh air, you know?

703
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,200
I used to do that. Go up to a house
in the mountains and sit by the water.

704
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,880
It was beautiful.

705
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,480
So I'm curious. Where'd you go?

706
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,320
Why do you ask?

707
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,160
Come here.

708
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,040
Come here.

709
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,040
Come on, come here.

710
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,360
"Time

711
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,400
"ls on my side

712
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:52,600
"Yes, it is

713
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,840
"Time

714
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,480
"ls on my side

715
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,280
"Yes, it is"

716
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,080
-Lou?
-What?

717
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,720
"You're always saying

718
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,640
"That you want to be free

719
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,120
"But I'll come running back"

720
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:30,080
Why were you singing that song?

721
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,440
-Song?
-Why were you singing that song?

722
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,320
I was singing?

723
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:36,160
Did they put you up to this?
Why did you sing that song?

724
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,040
What're you talking about?

725
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:40,080
-You don't know what I'm talking about?
-No, I don't.

726
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:43,640
You don't know what I'm talking about?

727
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,040
Hey, you!

728
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:12,760
Syrian Aramaic.

729
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,440
How clever.

730
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,000
Jesus.

731
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,880
It's true what I said.

732
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,920
I do know who you are.

733
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:25,080
Azazel.

734
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,120
Where'd you get that?

735
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,080
From Milano's place?

736
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,440
You found something up there.

737
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,320
Well, some things, pal, you shouldn't know.

738
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:36,880
Like what?

739
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:38,800
Like what?

740
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:42,680
If you know, you should never, ever tell.

741
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,160
Beware of my wrath.

742
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,040
Well?

743
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,160
What were you doing back then?

744
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,320
-What are you talking about?
-You were singing.

745
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:20,600
No.

746
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,440
-I wasn't singing.
-You were.

747
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:25,320
Lawrence and Mike were singing
some '60s thing.

748
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,560
There you go.

749
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:30,480
I wasn't singing it. I hated the fucking '60s.

750
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,680
I wasn't singing.

751
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:41,200
I appreciate your situation, okay?
I really do.

752
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,800
Your father, mother, they're dead,
their lives were ruined, your life's ruined.

753
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,200
I'm very sorry about that.

754
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:51,200
But I gotta know what's going on.
If this thing is what it seems to be...

755
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:54,800
...if this thing is what the book says
that it is, then....

756
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,520
Is this for real? Do you believe this stuff?

757
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,440
I believe more is hidden than is seen.

758
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:09,520
I believe what I see. I'm trying to get
my mind around what I just saw.

759
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,200
Something...

760
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,680
...threatened me.

761
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:15,200
Reese threatened me in Aramaic.

762
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,120
What else did Reese say?

763
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:19,120
I'm asking the questions here.

764
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:24,040
You answer the questions I ask.
Because if I don't know what's going on--

765
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:27,200
We're not supposed to know.
We're not supposed to see.

766
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,920
It's like the Mafia. They don't even exist.

767
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,280
Okay...okay.

768
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:34,560
That's good. That's a start.
They don't even exist.

769
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:37,200
So where are they from?
Who the hell are they?

770
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:40,040
There are certain phenomena...

771
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:43,360
...which can only be explained
if there is a god...

772
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:46,920
...and if there are angels.
And there are. They exist.

773
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:51,760
Some angels were cast down. A few
were punished by being deprived of form.

774
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:55,360
They can only survive in the bodies
of others. It's inside of us.

775
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,440
Inside of human beings,
their vengeance is played out.

776
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:02,640
That's it?

777
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:05,400
Come on, get out of here.

778
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:07,560
Come on.

779
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,280
I mean....

780
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,880
Miss Milano, I'm just a cop, okay?

781
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,240
I'm a detective.

782
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,480
My work is based upon evidence, facts.

783
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:17,280
Mine, too. Mine, too.

784
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:21,640
Aren't your facts here
rather resistant to normal interpretation?

785
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:24,840
So you're saying that...

786
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:26,840
...Edgar Reese is actually--

787
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:29,560
At the time you knew him,
he was not himself.

788
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,480
-He was Azazel?
-Yes, Azazel.

789
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:34,280
Sadistic, left-handed, likes to sing.

790
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:37,000
Reese? Why does he focus in on me?

791
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,760
You got his attention.
He tried to get inside you.

792
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:44,200
He shook your hand. That didn't work,
so now he'll try to find some other way.

793
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:48,560
Like he did with your father?

794
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,680
How do we fight him? ls it possible?

795
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,920
I believe it is. And I'm not alone.

796
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:04,440
There's a network. I don't even know
who they are. I just have numbers.

797
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,200
These people know the--

798
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:09,640
We believe that God limited demons
and made them mortal.

799
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:12,400
He put a few of us here to fight them.

800
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,120
Us? Us who?

801
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:15,600
Who, us?

802
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,280
You're saying I'm one of these people?

803
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,120
I don't know. Maybe. Maybe not.

804
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,400
You're just doing your job.

805
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:25,360
Okay.

806
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:26,800
Touche.

807
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,560
So these demons are mortal?
They can be killed?

808
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:31,280
-By the right person.
-Who is?

809
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,480
This is religion, Mr. Hobbes.

810
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:37,120
These are matters of fate and divine order.
The right man--

811
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,760
-Or woman.
-Yes.

812
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,760
It could be you, me, anybody?

813
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:44,240
The right person of the right character
with the right knowledge....

814
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,320
So, this is what you've been doing.

815
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:48,920
You've been preparing for this,
haven't you?

816
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,440
Can I ask you something personal?

817
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:58,720
Everything's personal if you're a person.

818
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,720
Is this why you live alone?

819
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,560
There's a difference between
risking for yourself and someone else.

820
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:07,920
That's true.

821
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:09,280
I mean...

822
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:13,960
...if I had someone, I'd want to share
my life and thoughts, and work with them.

823
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:18,120
If I shared this, I'd put them at risk
and I don't have that right.

824
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:20,920
You can talk to me.

825
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:24,560
You don't have to. I'm not saying that....
I'm not, you know....

826
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:28,720
Do whatever you want to do. I'm just
saying you can talk to me if you want.

827
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:30,880
Thanks.

828
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:33,640
That's a very nice thing to say.

829
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:35,960
I've got to go.

830
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:37,960
I hope I've been helpful.

831
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:41,640
-Thanks for listening.
-Thank you.

832
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:48,840
I'm sorry.

833
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:51,080
I was about to tap you on the shoulder.

834
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:53,400
You're a friend of John Hobbes, right?

835
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:55,480
I'm Jay Reynolds.

836
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,000
You know?

837
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,600
How lovely.

838
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:06,800
You're not just Hobbes' chippy.

839
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:08,640
Have we met?

840
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,520
You seem vaguely familiar.

841
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,080
Come on...

842
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,320
...tell me.

843
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:17,160
I'm about to find out anyway.

844
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:24,120
Foreplay.

845
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,280
Watch out.

846
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:26,680
No, you don't!

847
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,360
Please, help me!

848
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:55,920
Go! Go!

849
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,000
-Open up!
-Go!

850
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:08,400
Jesus, are you all right?

851
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:31,720
Are you all right?

852
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:38,880
Thanks for coming.

853
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,600
I ran.

854
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:49,040
He came after me and I ran.

855
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:53,280
Maybe you weren't ready yet.

856
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:55,920
That's the point. You have to be ready.

857
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,200
You know what it is?

858
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:02,120
I never believed this day would come.

859
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:05,320
I thought God would make it up to me.
I'd be good...

860
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:07,840
...and God would show me
an angel instead.

861
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,200
Do they know who you are?

862
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,720
We shouldn't be seen together.

863
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:21,480
Not anymore.

864
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,360
Wipe your tears.

865
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,640
You wanted to see me, Lieutenant?

866
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,080
How're you doing?

867
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:47,480
Fine.

868
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,640
Murders not getting you wound up?

869
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,760
Bag the chocolates. You ain't got
to talk to me sideways. What's up?

870
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:59,160
Where were you
when Muskavich and Noons were killed?

871
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:01,360
Where was l?

872
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:03,280
Am I a suspect?

873
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:05,400
Sit down.

874
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,720
Not to me, you're not.

875
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:11,760
But....

876
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:16,040
Lieutenant, you know....
What is it, the phone records again?

877
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,400
What do they think I did?

878
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:22,040
I committed murder, then called home,
then ran home and answered my phone?

879
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:23,720
No, it's something else.

880
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:25,760
Your prints.

881
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:27,640
My prints?

882
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:29,280
On what?

883
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,800
On that fucking little coin of yours.

884
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:34,280
-Where?
-Noons' place.

885
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:45,400
Shit.

886
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:48,760
This is a frame-up.

887
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:49,840
Is it?

888
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:51,640
Anybody could have got those coins.

889
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:54,600
They could've got them
when I was at the store or something.

890
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,600
They could've taken them off my desk.

891
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,760
We always said it could be a cop.

892
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,200
We did always say that.

893
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:04,440
I'm not stupid, you know.

894
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:07,480
I know you know more than you're saying.

895
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:08,840
So tell me.

896
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:13,920
You don't really want to know.

897
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:17,200
You'd have to be there.
I was there and I don't even want to know.

898
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:18,440
Try me.

899
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:26,080
You remember Robert Milano?

900
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:27,520
Listen to me.

901
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:30,120
This is exactly what happened to him.

902
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,280
He was framed.

903
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,520
I'll give you some advice.

904
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:41,880
Let go of it for a couple of hours.

905
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:43,400
Go home.

906
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,280
See your family.

907
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:47,200
Take a load off.

908
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:56,280
The hell with Stanton.

909
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:58,560
The hell with all of them.

910
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:01,560
Nobody likes to get
the shit kicked out of them.

911
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:04,000
Nobody likes to get hit from every angle.

912
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,240
But eviljust keeps on coming.
You know what I mean?

913
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:09,800
You saw it before, but now...

914
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:13,480
...it's in your face, laughing at you.

915
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:18,120
-Hi, Unc.
-Hey, Sam.

916
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:20,760
How're you doing?

917
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:22,080
Hi, Mr. Hobbes.

918
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,520
You're home early today.

919
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,680
For a change.

920
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:57,120
-Did you move my address book?
-What?

921
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,200
No.

922
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:00,360
What?

923
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,320
What's wrong with your eye?

924
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:14,560
Who hit you in the eye?

925
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:16,360
I fell.

926
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:17,960
You fell?

927
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:20,960
I fell, or something.

928
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:24,200
People don't fall down and get a black eye.

929
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,720
-No?
-No.

930
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,560
All right, it's okay.

931
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:31,120
It's okay. Look....

932
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:33,640
What happened?

933
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,360
Sammy hit me.

934
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:37,520
What?

935
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:40,360
It was an accident though.
He didn't mean to.

936
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,640
He didn't mean to.

937
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:46,320
It was an accident. It was an accident!

938
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:47,960
John...John!

939
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:49,200
Sam?

940
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,120
Where's Toby?

941
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,200
Outside, I guess.

942
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,880
Okay, go back in the house.

943
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,600
-Toby?
-Hey, Hobbes.

944
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:13,800
Leave my family alone, you hear me?

945
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,440
Go back in the house.

946
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:17,840
-What's going on?
-Go back in the house!

947
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:25,160
-You leave my family alone.
-Why?

948
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:28,880
You came after me.
Now I'm coming after you and yours.

949
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:54,520
Toby, you all right?

950
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:56,480
Go right home. Go.

951
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,000
-Okay, I will.
-Run!

952
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:22,960
What's the matter, pal?
Are you afraid to fight me?

953
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:25,960
Come on, Hobbes. Come on out.

954
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:28,760
Come on, Hobbes.

955
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:31,400
Put the gun down.

956
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:34,400
I knew you'd come out.

957
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:36,200
Put the gun on the ground!

958
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:37,800
I know you, Hobbes.

959
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,440
Set the gun down, sir!

960
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,120
Put the gun down!

961
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:53,680
"Yes, it is

962
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:56,240
"Time

963
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:59,520
"ls on my side"

964
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:01,120
Hey, pal.

965
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:03,760
Wake up, Hobbes.

966
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,640
I'm not that easy to kill.

967
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:09,960
When my host dies and I move as spirit,
no man can resist me.

968
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:14,400
What are you going to do, arrest me?
What'll you tell Stanton?

969
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,240
I'd love to hear that one.

970
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:18,360
It's me you want, isn't it?

971
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:20,560
Why don't you just kill me?

972
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:22,560
But I'm still having fun.

973
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,240
Aren't you still having fun?

974
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:16,480
He was standing in the street,
yelling at him...

975
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:19,320
...shooting at him.
Finally, when the officer....

976
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:21,720
I guess that's it.

977
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,440
There's no question
that the dead man shot first?

978
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:34,960
No question at all. My wife saw it too,
if you want to ask her.

979
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,320
A schoolteacher.

980
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,480
What am I going to say?

981
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,120
What am I going to do?

982
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:48,080
We know that he fired first.
Witnesses corroborate.

983
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:52,120
But his gun was filled with blanks.
He got the gun out of a stolen car.

984
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:53,760
-It was a setup.
-A setup?

985
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,360
That's right. A setup.

986
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,240
He set it up for you to kill him?

987
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:58,520
Committing suicide by--

988
01:16:58,520 --> 01:16:59,680
Excuse me.

989
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:04,080
What the hell are you doing out here?

990
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:07,040
You take Sam home, lock every door,
every window....

991
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:09,640
You don't let anybody in. Can you do that?

992
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,280
Can you remember that? All right, do it.

993
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:13,800
-Johnny?
-Yeah?

994
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,720
Are you mad at me or something?

995
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,040
No, Art. Never. Just....

996
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:21,880
Do what I told you.

997
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:29,080
Hate to see the mighty fall,
you know what I mean?

998
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:31,880
Now it's letters. Fuck you, Lou.

999
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:34,680
I told you, it's a cult.

1000
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,760
Some weird, psycho,
Aramaic-Satanist reincarnation cult.

1001
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:41,400
He's got A-P-O written on his chest.

1002
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:44,560
Trying to send some kind of message.

1003
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:48,880
The killer's sending a message?

1004
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:51,680
Hobbes....

1005
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,880
This time, you are the killer.

1006
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:57,400
Yeah, sort of.

1007
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:59,000
No fucking "sort of."

1008
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,360
No breaks. No benefit of the doubt.

1009
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:04,560
We're going back to the precinct. Now.

1010
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:18,200
Tonight, another shocking murder
in the city.

1011
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:22,600
A well-respected schoolteacher
opened fire on an off-duty police officer.

1012
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:24,000
The officer...

1013
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:27,040
...John Hobbes, was forced to return fire.

1014
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:29,440
Our report now, from the scene.

1015
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:33,160
We're on the scene
of a most unusual homicide tonight.

1016
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:34,880
Close the door.

1017
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:38,080
Detective Hobbes shot and killed
a high-school math teacher.

1018
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:40,320
The police have not yet identified him.

1019
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:43,360
According to witnesses,
the man started shouting at Hobbes...

1020
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:45,440
...who was off duty at the time.

1021
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:49,360
I talked to the schoolteacher's wife.

1022
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:51,600
He got married four months ago.

1023
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,920
She's pregnant. He just got a raise.

1024
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,600
So much for suicide by a cop!

1025
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:04,480
The shooting team will need your gun.

1026
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,280
I'll get the hearing as soon as I can.

1027
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:10,360
People want the world to make sense.

1028
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:14,800
If the only way I can get the world
to make sense for me is to arrest you...

1029
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:17,200
...then I'll have to do it.

1030
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,680
Get the fuck out of here.

1031
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:06,280
-It was a clean shoot.
-Yeah, I know.

1032
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:08,200
It doesn't help, but I know.

1033
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:10,720
Coffee?

1034
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,200
No, thanks.

1035
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:17,120
Want to talk? From where I sit, we're
dealing with shit that ain't in the manual.

1036
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:23,640
Where do they buy coffee with dirt in it?
Can you tell me that?

1037
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,760
What's the point of life?

1038
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:32,560
-"The point"?
-Yeah.

1039
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:36,680
-"Of life"?
-Yeah.

1040
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,280
The point of life.... You want a cigarette?

1041
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:42,480
No, thanks.

1042
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,440
The point of life is we catch bad guys.

1043
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:50,360
That's what I used to think.

1044
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:53,800
It's not good enough.

1045
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:56,520
You can shoot me for talking like this, but--

1046
01:20:57,360 --> 01:21:00,800
It's two o'clock in the morning.
You can talk any way you want.

1047
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:05,320
What are we doing here?
You know what I'm saying?

1048
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:06,720
Why do we even exist?

1049
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:07,760
Us.

1050
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:11,440
Maybe it's God, Hobbes.

1051
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:13,840
Yeah, it could be.

1052
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:19,120
I have a hard time believing that we're...

1053
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:21,720
...part of some huge...

1054
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:26,240
...moral experiment, you know,
conducted by a greater being than us.

1055
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:30,520
If there's a greater being than we are,
why does he give a shit about us?

1056
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:34,080
There are five billion of us.
We're like ants. Do we care...

1057
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:36,560
...what ants do, from a moral standpoint?

1058
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:37,800
"Ants"? No.

1059
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:42,040
I'm following you,
but at the same time I'm losing you.

1060
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:44,280
Are you heading someplace here?

1061
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:45,880
That's my point.

1062
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:47,960
Are we headed someplace?

1063
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:50,560
If we don't figure it out....

1064
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,760
Maybe if you figure it out...

1065
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:57,440
...you die.

1066
01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:00,360
Heart attack, stroke.
You figure out what's what...

1067
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:04,400
...you don't get to hang around anymore.
You get promoted.

1068
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:07,880
Meanwhile, Delores...

1069
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:11,240
...says we're put here to do one thing.

1070
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:12,400
One thing?

1071
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:14,320
What's that?

1072
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:17,960
It's different. It's different for everybody.
Hers is lasagna.

1073
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:19,480
Lasagna?

1074
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:22,720
And just one thing, not two or...?

1075
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:25,400
Maybe two, I don't know.
It's just her opinion.

1076
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:27,480
But it's like...

1077
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:30,800
...when a moment comes...

1078
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:34,280
...we either do the right thing...

1079
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,160
...or wrong.

1080
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:40,160
When do you know
when your moment comes?

1081
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:51,880
So, like this could be it for me?

1082
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:54,080
That's the beauty. You never know.

1083
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,040
-Hello?
-John?

1084
01:22:58,320 --> 01:22:59,600
Is that you?

1085
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:04,240
Hi. I just wanted to see if you were okay.

1086
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:07,680
I'll call you back. I'll call you later.

1087
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,720
That was the killer.
We'll arrange things later.

1088
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:30,360
I'm going home.

1089
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:33,400
Yeah, fuck it.

1090
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:48,400
I killed someone.

1091
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:50,760
He got me to kill an innocent man.

1092
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:52,800
I know.

1093
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:54,840
What do they want, Gretta?

1094
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:57,240
Just tell me what they want.

1095
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:58,640
The demons?

1096
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:01,000
They want the fall of civilization.

1097
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,480
"The fall of Babylon, " as they put it.

1098
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:05,640
-The whole thing?
-Yeah.

1099
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:09,120
They're doing a goodjob, aren't they?

1100
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:11,720
You know, after I shot the teacher...

1101
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:14,120
...Azazel moved to someone else.

1102
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:16,520
Are you sure? After death?

1103
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:19,400
I'm positive. After death. Yeah, I saw it.

1104
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:20,560
Listen to this.

1105
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:23,520
I was looking through
one ofyour father's books...

1106
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:28,120
...and it says "outside"...
I guess that means outside the body.

1107
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:32,440
"Outside, they can survive
for one breath only. "

1108
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:36,680
A Hebrew text says that the breath
can carry them for 500 cubits.

1109
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,560
I never knew what it meant.

1110
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:41,160
A cubit, that's a distance
or something, right?

1111
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:43,160
From your elbow to your fingertips.

1112
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:47,080
So 500 cubits would be what?
About a sixth of a mile?

1113
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:49,320
Yeah, well, you're right then.

1114
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:52,680
They are limited in certain ways.

1115
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:56,480
What are you thinking?

1116
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:58,600
I don't know.

1117
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:03,240
I don't know. Are you okay?

1118
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:05,320
Yeah.

1119
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:07,560
All right. Well, then...

1120
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:10,440
...maybe I'll check up on you tomorrow.

1121
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:13,840
Good night.

1122
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:15,040
Good night.

1123
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,240
Good morning, Sam.

1124
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:41,680
Good morning, Sam.

1125
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:43,120
Oh, hi, Uncle John.

1126
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:44,200
Oh, hi.

1127
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:47,480
-Thanks for tucking me in last night.
-You're welcome.

1128
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:52,080
We sent Michael Aaron to the scene...

1129
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:56,200
...where he'll be ready with a live report
shortly. We'll be right back.

1130
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:49,080
Were you asleep when I tucked you in?

1131
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:53,000
I don't know. All I remember
was somebody tickling me.

1132
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:54,640
Tickling my chest.

1133
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:02,000
Why'd you write that?

1134
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:06,400
-Where's your father?
-In the bedroom.

1135
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:07,880
He's a sleepyhead.

1136
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,960
Ifyou watched the national news
just last week...

1137
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:18,440
...you might have seen
a similar case in Boston...

1138
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:21,080
...of a decorated cop accused of murder.

1139
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:33,440
Hello?

1140
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:35,400
Have you seen the news?

1141
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:38,640
The cop was shooting first.
And he kept on shooting.

1142
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,480
Lou's coming to get you.

1143
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:43,640
He'll bring you down
for more conversation.

1144
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:44,960
-Lou?
-No.

1145
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:47,480
-They get him yet?
-No. Not yet.

1146
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:50,800
I gotta go.

1147
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:29,560
Here. Put these clothes on.
Get dressed right away.

1148
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:31,920
-Why?
-Just do what I tell you, please!

1149
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:42,240
Are you ready?

1150
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:44,560
Almost. What's going on here?

1151
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:48,040
We're just going to play
a little trick on somebody.

1152
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:49,360
Cool.

1153
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:56,000
We're going out the window.

1154
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:00,480
What about my dad?

1155
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:04,840
He's sleeping. He's still asleep.

1156
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:53,120
-Excuse me, Sister. How're you doing?
-Good.

1157
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:54,440
Good.

1158
01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:58,240
Does "apocalypse" mean anything to you?

1159
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:00,080
Sure it does.

1160
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:03,040
"Apocalypse" was the Greek word
for "revelation."

1161
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:04,840
"Revelation"?

1162
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:08,160
-You mean like the book of the Bible?
-Yes.

1163
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:09,320
Revelation.

1164
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:11,040
All right. Thank you.

1165
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:41,680
Pack of cigarettes.

1166
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:44,120
-Any special kind?
-No, any kind.

1167
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:46,440
Okay, out of five.

1168
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:50,680
Detective Hobbes?

1169
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:52,880
Sir, you forgot your change.

1170
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:54,440
Detective Hobbes.

1171
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:56,320
I want to talk to you.

1172
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:03,280
Go, Sam. Run! Down the stairs,
down the stairs! Go!

1173
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:05,360
All units in the area--

1174
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:45,120
Why don't you close that coat up?

1175
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:58,000
Cigarettes?

1176
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:01,040
I thought you quit.
I thought they were bad for you.

1177
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:03,280
I did quit and they are bad for you.

1178
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:08,240
You know what's going on?

1179
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:16,480
The police think that I did some bad things.

1180
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:20,000
-You are the police.
-Not anymore.

1181
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:22,920
Why do they think you did that?

1182
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:24,080
Because....

1183
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:27,280
Because somebody...

1184
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:29,960
...made it look like I did.

1185
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:32,320
I once saw that on a show.

1186
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:44,560
I want to talk to you
about something else, too.

1187
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:46,520
About your dad.

1188
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:52,200
He's not asleep, is he?

1189
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:57,560
No, son. He's not asleep.

1190
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:00,960
Did it hurt?

1191
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:05,800
I don't think so.

1192
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:10,040
-Do you think he's gonna go to Heaven?
-Yes.

1193
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:11,760
Yes, I do.

1194
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:15,200
If anybody deserves to go to Heaven,
it's your dad.

1195
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,440
I think so, too.

1196
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:51,360
We've got no place else to go.

1197
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:53,040
This is my nephew, Sam.

1198
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,680
Okay. Hi, Sam.

1199
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:58,760
Nice to meet you. I'm Gretta.

1200
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:03,120
You're in your pajamas.

1201
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:06,480
I wasn't expecting company,
but I'm glad you're here.

1202
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:13,280
Why don't you go over there
by the fireplace and get warm.

1203
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:15,880
Azazel wrote on his chest.

1204
01:36:15,880 --> 01:36:17,600
Unless I do something--

1205
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:21,320
I'll get you a coffee.

1206
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:22,440
Thank you.

1207
01:37:23,120 --> 01:37:25,840
I think I got my mind
around this thing now, but let me...

1208
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:27,920
...let me run this by you, okay?

1209
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:30,800
After the host body dies...

1210
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:34,960
...the demon can survive
for one breath or 500 cubits, right?

1211
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:36,360
At the same time...

1212
01:37:36,360 --> 01:37:40,120
...Azazel says to me when he moves
as spirit no man can resist.

1213
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:43,680
So someone he can't get into by touch,
he can still get into by spirit.

1214
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:47,400
Because, if when he's in spirit form...

1215
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:52,080
...he's fighting for his life,
he's going to be that much more powerful.

1216
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:57,920
Please tell me what you're going to do.

1217
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:59,440
Whatever I do...

1218
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:03,920
...l have to make sure
that you and Sam are safe.

1219
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:06,720
Will you take him somewhere...

1220
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:08,400
...nobody knows about?

1221
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:10,360
Even me.

1222
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:26,320
Listen....

1223
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:30,160
I gotta go.

1224
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:34,080
You're gonna stay with Gretta
for a little while.

1225
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:35,800
Maybe for a long while.

1226
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:39,400
And I want you to remember this:

1227
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:41,680
Whatever people say about me...

1228
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:44,920
...or whatever I do...

1229
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:49,440
...l just want you to remember
that I'm doing it for you.

1230
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:51,880
Because I love you.

1231
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:54,160
You understand?

1232
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:00,360
I'm gonna go back to sleep...

1233
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:05,320
...and when I wake up
everything is gonna be just the way it was.

1234
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:41,400
Thank you.

1235
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:45,800
You know what this means, right?

1236
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:48,520
I'm ready.

1237
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:27,840
Hey, Jonesy, how're you doing?

1238
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:29,560
Look, I'm worried, man.

1239
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:32,120
What are you gonna do?
Where are you gonna go?

1240
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:33,960
I'm going nowhere.

1241
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:36,600
I'm taking a long drive...

1242
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:39,520
...where nobody will find me...

1243
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:42,120
...and sit by the water and think.

1244
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:44,440
I gotta ask you something.

1245
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:46,120
Yeah, shoot.

1246
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:48,560
We've been partners a long time.

1247
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:51,360
Twelve plus, Jonesy. Twelve plus.

1248
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:54,920
So, is there anything you gotta tell me?

1249
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:59,320
Yeah, remember what
we were talking about the other night?

1250
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:01,880
When the moment comes...

1251
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:03,640
...you know it.

1252
01:41:05,480 --> 01:41:06,840
Be careful, okay?

1253
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:09,080
I'll see you, partner.

1254
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:10,600
Yeah, you too.

1255
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:12,640
Be good.

1256
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:44,360
You're probably wondering:
What am I doing?

1257
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:48,200
This is where things get a little tricky.

1258
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:50,440
It'sjust him and me now.

1259
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
Hobbes versus Azazel.

1260
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:56,760
I thought I had him.

1261
01:41:57,160 --> 01:41:59,080
But he thought he had me, too.

1262
01:43:49,680 --> 01:43:50,920
Come on out.

1263
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:53,240
I know you're here.

1264
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:56,040
I knew you'd come.

1265
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:08,640
Haven't you done enough?

1266
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:14,400
You made me kill an innocent man. You...

1267
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:19,240
...murdered my brother!

1268
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:22,400
Come out, you son of a bitch!

1269
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:25,400
How much more fun can you have!

1270
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:31,560
Jesus, Hobbes.

1271
01:44:33,080 --> 01:44:35,560
What are you talking about?

1272
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:39,480
I didn't do any of that.

1273
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:44,920
Me, I'm the poor schmo
they sent up here to bring you in.

1274
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:48,600
So it's you now.

1275
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:50,080
It's me.

1276
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:52,040
Who'd you expect it'd be?

1277
01:44:53,200 --> 01:44:55,040
Now drop your gun, Hobbes.

1278
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:57,520
I know you've got one.

1279
01:44:58,120 --> 01:44:59,320
Or what?

1280
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:01,120
You'll shoot me?

1281
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:04,240
Where is the fun in that?

1282
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:06,000
Fuck you, huh?

1283
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:08,400
You're making me do this.

1284
01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:11,000
Now, drop the goddamn gun.

1285
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,720
Do what he says, Hobbes.

1286
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:18,920
Jonesy?

1287
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:32,160
Who else is out here, huh?

1288
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:33,840
Lou? Tiff? Come on out!

1289
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:35,760
No, it's just the two of us.

1290
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:40,400
The gun, Hobbes.

1291
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:08,040
Jonesy, you know I didn't do this.

1292
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:11,000
You know I didn't do any of it.

1293
01:46:11,320 --> 01:46:12,720
I know that, Hobbes.

1294
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:16,280
We both want to believe you,
but we've gotta bring you in.

1295
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:30,080
Stan....

1296
01:46:31,120 --> 01:46:33,040
I don't know if I can do this.

1297
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:36,200
What the fuck you talking...?

1298
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:39,120
Say Hobbes disappears into the woods....

1299
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:43,200
We drive his car into the lake.
End of story. What's wrong with that?

1300
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:46,200
We bring the son of a bitch in.
That's why we're up here.

1301
01:46:46,200 --> 01:46:47,560
He did it, fine.

1302
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:49,520
He didn't do it, even better.

1303
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:53,320
But it's not our job to decide.
Now drop the goddamn gun!

1304
01:46:57,600 --> 01:46:58,880
Jonesy?

1305
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:03,000
Put the goddamn gun down.

1306
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:14,000
Okay.

1307
01:47:29,160 --> 01:47:30,200
Thank you.

1308
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:36,760
I'm sorry, Stan.

1309
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:40,960
Been on the force so many years you think
you've seen it all, but you haven't.

1310
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:42,840
Life always gives you one more surprise.

1311
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:44,040
One more.

1312
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:51,960
Sometimes it's a big one.

1313
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:53,840
Azazel.

1314
01:47:55,080 --> 01:47:56,680
I'm your partner, man.

1315
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,360
You're free. Run.

1316
01:48:00,120 --> 01:48:01,680
Keep thinking, Hobbes.

1317
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:08,000
How about that!

1318
01:48:09,120 --> 01:48:11,600
Jonesy's fucked. He just killed his boss.

1319
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:15,280
Jonesy's fucked!

1320
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:16,760
You're fucked!

1321
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:18,560
One at a time, huh?

1322
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,080
That's how we do it. One by one.

1323
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:24,680
Olly-olly-oxen-free!

1324
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:28,200
"Time

1325
01:48:29,680 --> 01:48:31,840
"ls on my side

1326
01:48:32,320 --> 01:48:34,160
"Yes, it is

1327
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:36,240
"Time

1328
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:38,720
"ls on my side"

1329
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:40,640
You like the Stones, Hobbes?

1330
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:43,840
I bet you didn't, you big Monkee-fan pussy.

1331
01:48:49,120 --> 01:48:50,400
Time's up!

1332
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,480
See the deal?

1333
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:56,240
If I kill you...

1334
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:00,200
...it's just the final...

1335
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:02,080
...pathetic chapter...

1336
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:04,800
...in the life of a disgraced hero.

1337
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:08,880
Just one more piece of shit, human scum.

1338
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:12,080
But...

1339
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:13,560
...turn it around.

1340
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:16,320
If I die...

1341
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:22,400
...l enter you...

1342
01:49:23,360 --> 01:49:25,600
...put 20 more murders on your tab...

1343
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:27,840
...before you go down.

1344
01:49:29,880 --> 01:49:32,080
Maybe your nephew or that...

1345
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:35,680
...chippy you were talking to.

1346
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:39,840
How do you want to do this?
I die, you die?

1347
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:42,240
What's maximum fun? Can you guess...

1348
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,760
...what maximum fun is?

1349
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:48,320
Sure you can.

1350
01:49:50,120 --> 01:49:52,520
Now that I've played you
from the outside...

1351
01:49:52,520 --> 01:49:54,400
...maximum fun is...

1352
01:49:54,920 --> 01:49:56,640
...l become you.

1353
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:31,280
You got me, Hobbes. You got me good.

1354
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:35,280
But I gotta ask you something.

1355
01:50:35,960 --> 01:50:38,520
You wouldn't let me kill myself.
Why is that?

1356
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:40,320
Because I need more time.

1357
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:42,080
Time for what, asshole?

1358
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:46,600
Five hundred cubits.
That's a long way, Azazel.

1359
01:50:47,160 --> 01:50:49,000
If Jonesy dies too fast...

1360
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:50,960
...as powerful as you are...

1361
01:50:52,120 --> 01:50:53,960
...l might never get away from you.

1362
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:56,000
Oh, he's catching on.

1363
01:50:56,920 --> 01:50:59,120
What? You think you're going to win?

1364
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:01,640
God willing.

1365
01:51:08,120 --> 01:51:09,600
You never know.

1366
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:18,200
Let me ask you something.

1367
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:24,600
Why do you think...

1368
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:26,840
...Milano...

1369
01:51:27,320 --> 01:51:29,240
...came all the way out here...

1370
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:31,000
...in the middle of nowhere?

1371
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,040
To die, the little chickenshit.

1372
01:51:34,640 --> 01:51:36,000
I don't think so.

1373
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:39,680
I think that he wanted to do...

1374
01:51:40,280 --> 01:51:41,880
...what I'm going to do.

1375
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:45,080
-Only he couldn't pull it off.
-Pull what off?

1376
01:51:45,080 --> 01:51:46,800
Oh, come on, Azazel.

1377
01:51:48,120 --> 01:51:49,880
Open your eyes.

1378
01:51:51,640 --> 01:51:53,120
Look around sometime.

1379
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,760
Here we are in this beautiful place...

1380
01:51:57,760 --> 01:52:00,600
...not another human being
around for miles.

1381
01:52:01,400 --> 01:52:02,920
It's just you and me.

1382
01:52:11,160 --> 01:52:13,600
What is this? You don't smoke anymore.

1383
01:52:18,960 --> 01:52:20,600
That's right. I don't.

1384
01:52:21,720 --> 01:52:22,880
You know why?

1385
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:27,520
Because cigarettes kill.

1386
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:32,480
Especially cigarettes laced with poison.

1387
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:36,000
Bullshit.

1388
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:40,480
Same poison that you used
to kill my brother.

1389
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:45,680
Fuck you.

1390
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:48,600
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1391
01:52:49,040 --> 01:52:50,440
Isn't it so sweet?

1392
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:52,800
We die together...

1393
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:54,480
...just you and me.

1394
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:03,120
"Time

1395
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:06,480
"ls on my side

1396
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:10,600
"Yes, it is"

1397
01:53:10,600 --> 01:53:12,560
Fuck you, motherfucker!

1398
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:23,480
I'm sorry, Jonesy.

1399
01:53:36,760 --> 01:53:37,880
I'm sorry.

1400
01:54:39,480 --> 01:54:42,240
So, like I said at the start...

1401
01:54:42,520 --> 01:54:43,920
...l was beaten...

1402
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:46,520
...outsmarted, poisoned...

1403
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:49,720
...by Detective John Hobbes.

1404
01:55:00,280 --> 01:55:04,360
Can you imagine what it feels like
to be alive for thousands ofyears...

1405
01:55:04,640 --> 01:55:07,360
...and realize you're actually going to die...

1406
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:11,880
...because some self-righteous cop decided
he was going to save the fucking world?

1407
01:55:14,600 --> 01:55:16,360
Yes, a demon can die...

1408
01:55:16,840 --> 01:55:20,080
...and Hobbes figured out
how to beat me at my own game.

1409
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:21,680
So what?

1410
01:55:23,200 --> 01:55:25,440
The war isn't over, I promise you.

1411
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:28,040
Not by a long shot.

1412
01:55:45,640 --> 01:55:47,680
You forgot something, didn't you?

1413
01:55:49,640 --> 01:55:52,000
At the beginning I said
I was going to tell you...

1414
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:55,080
...about the time I almost died.

1415
01:56:02,040 --> 01:56:03,520
See you around.
