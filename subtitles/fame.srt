00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,012
I always worry that maybe people aren't
gonna like me when I go to a party.

3
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,468
Isn't that crazy?

4
00:01:24,349 --> 00:01:30,020
Do you ever get kind of a sick feeling in
your stomach when you dread things?

5
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:33,523
I wouldn't wanna miss a party,
but every time I go to one...

6
00:01:33,692 --> 00:01:37,525
...I keep feeling like
the whole world's against me.

7
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:41,030
See, I've spent my whole life
in military academies.

8
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,154
My mother doesn't have a place for me
where she lives...

9
00:01:44,328 --> 00:01:46,867
...and she doesn't know
what else to do with me.

10
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,785
You mustn't misunderstand about
my mother. She's really a lovely person.

11
00:01:51,961 --> 00:01:56,540
I guess every boy thinks his mother
is beautiful, but my mother really is.

12
00:01:56,716 --> 00:02:01,343
She tells me in every letter how sorry
she is that we're not together more...

13
00:02:01,513 --> 00:02:04,716
...but she has to think of her work.

14
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:08,841
One time we were together, though.
She met me in San Francisco once...

15
00:02:09,021 --> 00:02:13,897
...and we were together for two whole
days, just like we were sweethearts.

16
00:02:14,068 --> 00:02:17,900
It was the most wonderful time
I ever had.

17
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:22,568
Then I had to go back
to the military academy.

18
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:27,073
Every time I walk into that barracks,
I get a kind of...

19
00:02:33,171 --> 00:02:35,413
A kind of a...

20
00:02:40,053 --> 00:02:41,927
I'm sorry.

21
00:02:49,062 --> 00:02:51,933
Kind of a depressed feeling.

22
00:02:52,107 --> 00:02:56,021
It's got hard, stone walls.
You know what I mean?

23
00:02:56,612 --> 00:03:00,277
I guess I've bored you enough,
telling you about myself.

24
00:03:01,784 --> 00:03:03,444
Thank you.

25
00:03:03,619 --> 00:03:07,948
Sorry about that. I goofed up the last
couple of lines. I guess I'm nervous.

26
00:03:08,249 --> 00:03:10,122
That's okay. You did very well.

27
00:03:22,764 --> 00:03:24,590
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:52,418
Thank you. You play very well.

29
00:03:52,586 --> 00:03:57,794
Now Mrs. Tossoff's gonna play notes
for you. Sing them back to us. Like so:

30
00:04:01,887 --> 00:04:06,348
- It's too low for me.
- You're a tenor? You want to start here?

31
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,345
Louder, please.

32
00:04:49,395 --> 00:04:51,304
I'm so nervous.

33
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,853
- I'm not singing.
- But you have to.

34
00:04:54,025 --> 00:04:56,313
- But I came to dance.
- You have to sing too.

35
00:04:56,486 --> 00:04:58,893
- And act, and play an instrument.
- All three?

36
00:04:59,072 --> 00:05:02,156
- It says "performing arts," doesn't it?
- You don't have to do everything.

37
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:08,239
- Sure as shit helps, baby.
- Thank you. Next group, please. Hurry.

38
00:05:08,415 --> 00:05:11,499
- Oh, I like your nose ring.
- I'm into culture.

39
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:15,838
- Does that hurt, or is that ethnic?
- Music, please, Mrs. Snell.

40
00:05:16,006 --> 00:05:19,790
Please pay attention.
We have a lot to do today.

41
00:05:22,804 --> 00:05:25,759
- I hate my legs.
- Yeah. Me too.

42
00:05:25,974 --> 00:05:29,924
- I've tried every diet in the whole world.
- Really? Me too.

43
00:05:30,312 --> 00:05:34,939
But you can't help your glands.
I'm sorry! I'm just so nervous.

44
00:05:35,109 --> 00:05:38,193
Relax! Come on, use your body.

45
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:51,579
- Careful. That's 7000 worth of machine.
- Dollars or pounds?

46
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:55,286
Don't touch the rotary pods.
I got it set on saw-tooth.

47
00:05:55,463 --> 00:06:00,090
Why can't he play piccolo? Something
sensible. Or the accordion, like Papa did.

48
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,961
Same reason you drive a checker and
not a Roman chariot. It's progress.

49
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:08,219
My son's head is into the future.
And Papa could never play the accordion.

50
00:06:13,482 --> 00:06:17,100
- Do you think you're talented?
- You swine! You coward! You cad!

51
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,810
You dare judge me in my misfortitude?

52
00:06:19,989 --> 00:06:23,773
You dare to ask me the question
who is the father of my child?

53
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:28,613
- You! You! I point to you, Nigel!
- Next, please.

54
00:06:28,873 --> 00:06:34,329
The next group of musicians can
go to the fifth floor now, please.

55
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:49,386
- Name?
- Excuse me, miss.

56
00:06:49,561 --> 00:06:53,345
You don't need his name. He's not here
for the audition. He's my partner.

57
00:06:53,523 --> 00:06:55,682
- What school's he from?
- He ain't into school.

58
00:06:55,859 --> 00:07:00,936
He's just helping me out with my
dancing. But it's me who's auditioning.

59
00:07:01,114 --> 00:07:05,112
Mulholland, Shirley. I'm all fixed up.
I filled in all your papers and all.

60
00:07:05,285 --> 00:07:07,527
He doesn't go upstairs
without filling in his name.

61
00:07:07,705 --> 00:07:12,865
Leroy's his name, but I'm auditioning.
Shirley Mulholland. That's two L's.

62
00:07:13,043 --> 00:07:17,622
- And don't ask him to do no writing.
- Doesn't he talk, even?

63
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,509
He ain't into conversation
until you get to know him.

64
00:07:21,052 --> 00:07:25,097
- Leroy what?
- Leroy Johnson. Can we go up now?

65
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,427
He's not going up
until he checks his knife.

66
00:07:28,601 --> 00:07:31,851
We ain't staying long enough for
no trouble. He's just helping a friend.

67
00:07:32,063 --> 00:07:35,397
He's not helping out anyone
unless he checks his knife.

68
00:07:35,567 --> 00:07:39,232
This is the High School for Performing
Arts. We don't cut each other up here.

69
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,071
- You want it?
- I want it.

70
00:07:42,407 --> 00:07:44,815
- You sure you want it?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

71
00:07:46,078 --> 00:07:49,162
- Promise you won't steal it, now?
- I promise.

72
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,033
- Thanks, ma'am.
- Name?

73
00:07:54,253 --> 00:07:57,669
Don't worry, baby. I got lots of knives.

74
00:07:58,549 --> 00:08:01,585
- What are you going to do for us?
- I was gonna sing.

75
00:08:01,802 --> 00:08:05,171
- You don't have to sing, honey.
- We know our rights.

76
00:08:05,348 --> 00:08:09,559
- You can't refuse her an audition.
- She's not supposed to sing her audition.

77
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:14,769
Please, excuse me, if you don't mind.
Honey, you don't have to sing for us...

78
00:08:14,941 --> 00:08:18,725
- ... because this is the drama department.
- When she sings, it is drama.

79
00:08:19,028 --> 00:08:21,602
- What's your name, honey?
- Finsecker.

80
00:08:24,117 --> 00:08:25,445
Doris Finsecker.

81
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:34,494
- Hi.
- How do you do?

82
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,793
- What's your name?
- Ralph Garci.

83
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:41,294
- Who was your teacher?
- Well, my father taught me.

84
00:08:41,468 --> 00:08:46,261
He's doing work for the government.
I'm not supposed to talk about it...

85
00:08:46,473 --> 00:08:52,726
...but my father played some of the
most beautiful symphonies...

86
00:08:52,897 --> 00:08:55,602
- ... in the whole world once.
- What did he play?

87
00:08:56,817 --> 00:08:58,775
Trombones.

88
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:02,151
And French horns.

89
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,731
English horns.

90
00:09:06,828 --> 00:09:08,904
- Saxophones.
- Anything else?

91
00:09:09,122 --> 00:09:10,450
Yeah.

92
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:16,916
- Bongos, maracas, that sort of stuff.
- What did he teach you?

93
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,173
Why don't you
try the dance department.

94
00:09:27,349 --> 00:09:30,848
- Why do you want to go to school here?
- Should I tell him?

95
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,468
Yeah, tell him.

96
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:36,308
We can't afford a professional
children's school.

97
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:42,441
Okay. If you want to sing, go ahead.
Then we'll look at your acting.

98
00:09:43,658 --> 00:09:45,366
I'm a little nervous.

99
00:09:45,576 --> 00:09:50,369
Don't be shy, Sheila. Come over here.
What are you going to do?

100
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:53,624
- I'm doing The Towering Inferno.
- What?

101
00:09:54,877 --> 00:09:58,044
- You know, the movie?
- Oh.

102
00:09:58,506 --> 00:10:01,673
All right, I'm playing O.J. Simpson.
I'm in this building.

103
00:10:01,843 --> 00:10:05,461
There's fire all around, right?
So I go to the elevator.

104
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,678
Think of it as a concentration exercise.
Just sing to Michael...

105
00:10:09,893 --> 00:10:15,350
- ... and don't worry about anybody else.
- I don't think I can. I can't just stare.

106
00:10:15,566 --> 00:10:17,190
He won't mind.

107
00:10:20,612 --> 00:10:24,906
- Waiting for the elevator.
- Press the button, Doris.

108
00:10:29,914 --> 00:10:31,159
Her brother Harvey.

109
00:10:52,771 --> 00:10:55,725
Doesn't come, so now I'm getting mad.

110
00:11:36,107 --> 00:11:40,603
Finally it comes, so I get in.
Okay, and there's people all around.

111
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:43,317
And they're looking right at me.

112
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:33,827
Yeah, my father taught me. I'm not
supposed to talk about him right now.

113
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,788
He's doing a little bit of work
for the government, but...

114
00:12:36,962 --> 00:12:41,209
My father is very, very famous.
He danced with the Rockettes.

115
00:12:41,717 --> 00:12:43,793
Sure. Would you begin, please?

116
00:12:45,345 --> 00:12:48,300
- I'll be doing "Swanee River" for you.
- Okay.

117
00:12:48,474 --> 00:12:51,047
And...

118
00:12:51,227 --> 00:12:56,138
Hon? "Swanee River," please.
Hit it.

119
00:13:00,403 --> 00:13:04,151
Doris, what would you do
if you don't make it?

120
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,820
We'll make it.

121
00:13:06,409 --> 00:13:08,567
Next, please.

122
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:11,996
But I that am not shaped
for sportive tricks...

123
00:13:12,165 --> 00:13:15,082
...nor made to court
an amorous looking glass...

124
00:13:15,251 --> 00:13:18,418
...I that am- Cheated of-
Oh, I'm sorry.

125
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,103
Why don't you try
the drama department.

126
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:42,607
If again "it was not well cut,"
he'd answer, I spake not true:

127
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,105
This is called the Reply Churlish.

128
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:48,450
Nobody talks about it,
but there's a quota system.

129
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:53,531
Your chances are better if you're black,
Puerto Rican or everything, like me.

130
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:58,002
- I am Puerto Rican.
- Not on your paper you ain't, Garci.

131
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:01,955
- Your daddy doing government work.
- That's the truth.

132
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:06,422
And he left you his tap shoes, right?
Does he work for Pepsi-Cola too?

133
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:08,218
Be careful.

134
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:11,142
- To the left. Left.
- Come the other way.

135
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:12,969
All right.

136
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:15,766
Easy, now. Straight back, Bruno?

137
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:20,609
- Where do you want this at?
- Far corner.

138
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,945
How do you do?

139
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:26,984
Okay. Fine.

140
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:31,406
Great. Look, I'll do that. You just go
and get the rest of the stuff, okay?

141
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,656
Oh, Martelli. Bruno Martelli.

142
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:37,333
Would you like to set up
your equipment, Mr. Martelli?

143
00:14:42,675 --> 00:14:44,253
Who taught you?

144
00:14:44,427 --> 00:14:50,181
Who taught me? My father taught me.
He's in Spain. He makes Westerns.

145
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:54,679
- Why do you want to go to school here?
- Because Freddie went here.

146
00:14:54,938 --> 00:14:58,888
- Freddie?
- Freddie Prinze. He's the best.

147
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:02,816
- So you want to be an actor, huh?
- Yeah, sure, I want to be an actor.

148
00:15:02,988 --> 00:15:05,526
Judy, Judy, Judy.
Top of the world, Ma.

149
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:10,361
We don't want you to perform. We want
to see who you are. You understand?

150
00:15:10,704 --> 00:15:12,946
- Right.
- Use your own experience.

151
00:15:13,332 --> 00:15:16,286
Be simple, be honest,
but most of all, be yourself.

152
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:20,833
- Be honest. Be simple. Be yourself?
- Be yourself.

153
00:15:22,341 --> 00:15:26,719
I'm God, see? And God
is Puerto Rican, you got that? Now.

154
00:15:27,305 --> 00:15:31,468
God works in a casa de steam,
you know. It's a steam bath, right?

155
00:15:31,642 --> 00:15:37,763
And he's talking to this angel. This angel
is a computer. An electronic computer.

156
00:15:37,941 --> 00:15:42,769
I'm God, see? That's why I'm standing
on this chair, you got that? Good.

157
00:15:52,247 --> 00:15:55,747
Does he wanna be a musician
or an airline pilot?

158
00:15:56,835 --> 00:16:00,750
Mr. Martelli. We are ready when you are.
Would you care to begin?

159
00:16:00,964 --> 00:16:03,586
Oh, okay. Sure.

160
00:16:28,576 --> 00:16:29,608
Mr. Martelli.

161
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,037
Mr. Martelli.

162
00:16:38,128 --> 00:16:39,290
Mr. Martelli!

163
00:16:41,298 --> 00:16:44,963
Thank you. One instrument
at a time will be quite sufficient.

164
00:16:45,177 --> 00:16:47,964
I could do it in 4/4
if you prefer a disco beat.

165
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,399
She's a disaster.

166
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:28,359
Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name.

167
00:18:28,534 --> 00:18:31,404
Or, if thou wilt not,
be but sworn my love...

168
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:36,406
...and then I'll no longer be a Capu-
Capu- Capu-something.

169
00:18:36,584 --> 00:18:40,831
- Capulet.
- Like Cappelletti, the football player?

170
00:18:41,005 --> 00:18:43,163
- Something like that.
- That's what I mean.

171
00:18:47,553 --> 00:18:50,638
- Where's his application?
- He doesn't have one.

172
00:18:50,807 --> 00:18:53,013
Well, get him one.

173
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:14,115
- What do you call that?
- Wicked.

174
00:19:26,802 --> 00:19:28,261
Thou art thyself.

175
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:31,632
Thou art not a Montagoo-
Montagazz- Who knows?

176
00:19:31,807 --> 00:19:37,561
This is the last day of auditions. We've
seen a lot of students. We're punchy.

177
00:19:37,772 --> 00:19:43,277
We're gonna take a break. Go next door
to Mrs. Shime. Have her audition you.

178
00:19:43,444 --> 00:19:46,564
- Right next door.
- I tell her that you sent me?

179
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,649
- Yeah.
- All right.

180
00:19:48,825 --> 00:19:50,236
By the way...

181
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:54,574
- ... you were reading the girl's part.
- Shit.

182
00:19:55,707 --> 00:19:59,657
- You're not into high school, remember?
- I'm into dancing.

183
00:19:59,836 --> 00:20:05,175
You're into ass, you mean. You don't
have to go to high school for that.

184
00:20:05,342 --> 00:20:10,337
- I was doing you a favor, remember?
- Some fat fucking favor.

185
00:20:11,557 --> 00:20:17,180
Take your things to the third floor.
Give your forms to the senior there.

186
00:20:17,521 --> 00:20:22,184
Okay, you go downstairs, change
in the girls' room and wait for him.

187
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,693
I'm through?
I don't have to dance anymore?

188
00:20:25,863 --> 00:20:28,864
Where you going, Leroy?
He's in and I'm out, right?

189
00:20:29,075 --> 00:20:35,114
Fuck you, Leroy! This was my audition,
remember? You're not into high school.

190
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:40,877
We were rehearsing to get me into this
school, not you, you fucker! It's not fair!

191
00:20:41,046 --> 00:20:44,794
I didn't want to come here anyway.
This school sucks.

192
00:20:45,008 --> 00:20:47,215
You've done me a favor, shithead.

193
00:20:47,427 --> 00:20:51,674
You saved me four fucking years
from this ass-licking school!

194
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:55,224
You looking at one happy lady!

195
00:20:56,478 --> 00:21:00,227
Who wants to go to a fucking school
to learn to dance, anyway?

196
00:21:02,026 --> 00:21:03,734
Yeah, hello?

197
00:21:03,903 --> 00:21:09,407
No, it isn't. This is Naomi Finsecker
speaking. Her mother. Who is this?

198
00:21:19,127 --> 00:21:23,588
Replacement?
What do you mean, replacement?

199
00:21:27,636 --> 00:21:30,340
So is she in or is she out?

200
00:21:33,433 --> 00:21:36,683
I got in! I got in!
I got into Performing Arts!

201
00:21:41,442 --> 00:21:44,111
Doris, we're in!

202
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,999
Get her out of there!

203
00:22:40,294 --> 00:22:44,162
- Hey, later on.
- All right. All right!

204
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,665
See y'all later.

205
00:22:47,426 --> 00:22:50,630
- Hello.
- Hey, mama, get in the car!

206
00:22:54,517 --> 00:22:58,052
Come on, baby, come on.
Don't go to school.

207
00:22:58,229 --> 00:23:01,681
- Martelli, Bruno.
- Bruno. Come on.

208
00:23:01,858 --> 00:23:03,649
Garcia, Raul.

209
00:23:04,945 --> 00:23:08,195
- Garcia, Raul?
- It's Ralph.

210
00:23:09,866 --> 00:23:12,702
- It says Raul.
- I don't relate to that.

211
00:23:13,912 --> 00:23:16,866
- Garcia, Ralph.
- It's Garci.

212
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:21,121
Ralph Garci. I think they
spelled it wrong on the application.

213
00:23:21,295 --> 00:23:23,868
- Garci, Ralph.
- Here.

214
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,876
- MacNeil, Montgomery.
- Here.

215
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:32,554
- Monroe, Lisa.
- Yes?

216
00:23:34,058 --> 00:23:35,221
Johnson, Leroy.

217
00:23:37,436 --> 00:23:38,812
Johnson, Leroy?

218
00:23:41,065 --> 00:23:46,023
In future, Mr. Johnson, I'd like you to
leave your ghetto blaster at home.

219
00:23:46,404 --> 00:23:50,069
I'd have left it home
if it wasn't so goddamn boring in here.

220
00:23:50,742 --> 00:23:56,662
This is a classroom, Mr. Johnson. You're
going to be here for four years...

221
00:23:56,832 --> 00:24:00,283
...with your eyes open,
homework done, pencils sharpened...

222
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:06,250
...and all food, cigarettes and radios
outside. Do you understand me?

223
00:24:08,177 --> 00:24:12,044
- Why are you here, Mr. Johnson?
- Because I's young and single...

224
00:24:12,222 --> 00:24:15,342
- ... and I loves to mingle.
- Speak English.

225
00:24:15,518 --> 00:24:20,014
- I speak like I likes.
- This is my room. You'll speak as I like.

226
00:24:20,189 --> 00:24:24,732
I teach English. Now, if that's
a foreign language, you're gonna learn it.

227
00:24:26,863 --> 00:24:32,070
This is no Mickey Mouse school. You
won't get off easy because of talent.

228
00:24:32,285 --> 00:24:36,413
- I don't care how well you dance...
- Bitch run her fucking mouth.

229
00:24:36,623 --> 00:24:40,751
...or how many colored tutus you have.
If you don't give academic subjects...

230
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:44,786
- ... equal time, you're out.
- Bullshit.

231
00:24:44,965 --> 00:24:48,464
You have to arrive earlier
to get dressed and warmed up.

232
00:24:48,635 --> 00:24:51,921
You have to take outside classes
in your major field...

233
00:24:52,097 --> 00:24:56,973
...and study ballet, modern, folk,
jazz, tap and historical dance here...

234
00:24:57,144 --> 00:24:59,931
...as well as dance history,
supported adagio...

235
00:25:00,272 --> 00:25:05,480
...variation class, makeup, hairstyling
and even acting for dancers.

236
00:25:05,653 --> 00:25:11,027
50,000 people call themselves actors,
and maybe 500 are making a living at it.

237
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,364
Most of those do commercials to
pay the rent. The rest wait tables...

238
00:25:15,538 --> 00:25:19,951
...clean other people's apartments,
living on welfare and hope.

239
00:25:20,126 --> 00:25:22,498
Don't think talent's enough
to get you through.

240
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:27,167
You gotta have a strong technique,
a good agent, and most of all, thick skin.

241
00:25:27,384 --> 00:25:31,631
Now you're part of an underprivileged
minority, and you're going to suffer.

242
00:25:31,846 --> 00:25:36,176
Pulled tendons, shin splints,
swollen toes, smelly tights...

243
00:25:36,351 --> 00:25:39,803
Cattle calls, the humiliation,
the rejection...

244
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:45,354
Melodic dictation theory, keyboard
harmony, piano, piano literature...

245
00:25:45,527 --> 00:25:51,530
...music history, orchestration,
conducting, symphonic band...

246
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:55,366
- When do we have lunch?
- Lunch is at 11:30. One half-hour...

247
00:25:55,538 --> 00:25:58,704
- ... and then you'll have everything else.
- What's everything else?

248
00:25:58,874 --> 00:26:04,213
Biology, chemistry, algebra, English,
French, physics, history, et cetera.

249
00:26:04,589 --> 00:26:07,792
Dance is not a way
of getting through school.

250
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:12,297
It's a way of life, plus school.
The school part is easier.

251
00:26:12,514 --> 00:26:16,891
So you better like yourself a lot.
Because that's all you got to work with.

252
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:21,105
Use yourself.
Your voice, your experiences.

253
00:26:21,273 --> 00:26:26,231
Wanna accumulate some experiences?
I got plenty of experiences to spare.

254
00:26:27,863 --> 00:26:31,528
You know what?
I live with two chicks.

255
00:26:31,742 --> 00:26:34,696
Dance is the hardest
department in the school.

256
00:26:34,912 --> 00:26:37,485
Acting is the hardest
profession in the world.

257
00:26:37,706 --> 00:26:43,330
Music is the hardest profession of
them all. Isn't that right, Mrs. Tossoff?

258
00:26:43,504 --> 00:26:44,583
Indeed.

259
00:27:40,521 --> 00:27:42,146
Okay.

260
00:27:45,109 --> 00:27:47,647
No fighting. Stay in line, please.

261
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,360
Who's next?

262
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,542
Excuse me.

263
00:28:04,046 --> 00:28:08,257
- I'll be doing my scene Thursday...
- I'll be right back.

264
00:28:14,556 --> 00:28:16,134
Get out of my seat!

265
00:32:14,179 --> 00:32:18,557
- Hi.
- Hi. That's too wild for me.

266
00:32:19,643 --> 00:32:22,430
- I'm in your acting class.
- I know.

267
00:32:22,605 --> 00:32:24,763
Montgomery MacNeil.

268
00:32:25,441 --> 00:32:28,525
- Doris Finsecker.
- Hi. Wanna sit down?

269
00:32:28,694 --> 00:32:33,321
All right. Is your mother really
Marsha MacNeil, the actress?

270
00:32:33,491 --> 00:32:35,697
- That's right.
- She does wonderful work.

271
00:32:36,035 --> 00:32:38,740
- Have you seen her?
- But I've heard.

272
00:32:41,082 --> 00:32:44,914
- I didn't know she lived in New York.
- She doesn't. Officially, she does...

273
00:32:45,086 --> 00:32:49,547
...but she's been on the road forever.
She gets paid to stay in hotels...

274
00:32:49,716 --> 00:32:53,796
...but she stays with friends. Sends her
per diems home to me and Dr. Golden.

275
00:32:54,054 --> 00:32:57,755
- Is that your stepfather?
- My analyst.

276
00:32:59,142 --> 00:33:01,349
What's wrong with you?

277
00:33:01,812 --> 00:33:05,145
It's pretty technical, really.
I have problems.

278
00:33:08,902 --> 00:33:12,319
- What kind of problems?
- With women.

279
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:23,120
Fine. Swaying with a nice humming
sound, please. And:

280
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,704
Let the arms go.

281
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:35,010
Good, good, good.
And chew.

282
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,807
Faster.

283
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,432
Speed.

284
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:44,272
Tongues out.
Down.

285
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:46,023
Side. Side.

286
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:49,187
And round, round.
Come on.

287
00:33:59,163 --> 00:34:01,868
More energy!

288
00:34:04,627 --> 00:34:07,544
Do it together, please.
Keep moving.

289
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:11,961
Much better.
Much, much better now.

290
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:20,349
Reach for the jeté!

291
00:34:21,144 --> 00:34:23,813
And:

292
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:27,147
Impulse to impulse.

293
00:35:03,646 --> 00:35:05,105
Relax.

294
00:35:06,316 --> 00:35:07,774
Relax.

295
00:35:08,234 --> 00:35:11,817
Sense the floor against your bodies.

296
00:35:12,614 --> 00:35:15,864
Feel it against
the backs of your legs.

297
00:35:16,409 --> 00:35:18,034
Your arms.

298
00:35:18,829 --> 00:35:20,572
Your shoulders.

299
00:35:20,997 --> 00:35:23,702
Let your senses remember...

300
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:27,494
...this feeling of heaviness.

301
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:31,629
Relax and breathe.

302
00:35:32,468 --> 00:35:36,466
Relax and breathe.

303
00:35:38,307 --> 00:35:43,728
All right, let's go. Thank you.
Don't be late. Come on. Don't be late.

304
00:36:06,378 --> 00:36:09,332
- Should you be on this floor?
- I have a note.

305
00:36:09,506 --> 00:36:12,673
- Miss Berg wants a tambourine.
- Fine.

306
00:36:16,513 --> 00:36:20,214
Excuse me? Excuse me?
You speak English?

307
00:36:20,392 --> 00:36:22,551
- Bruno Martelli?
- He's across the hall.

308
00:36:22,728 --> 00:36:24,353
Thanks.

309
00:36:29,193 --> 00:36:31,766
- Hi.
- Hi.

310
00:36:33,531 --> 00:36:36,781
- What kind of music notes are those?
- Laser beams.

311
00:36:36,951 --> 00:36:40,865
- It's a requiem for Buck Rogers.
- Great.

312
00:36:41,622 --> 00:36:45,537
- You ever thought of doing real music?
- This is my music.

313
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:48,711
- I mean a band.
- I don't like bands. They crowd me.

314
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,293
- I prefer my basement, no people.
- There's money though, in summer trade.

315
00:36:53,468 --> 00:36:56,505
- If we get together in time.
- I'm really not interested.

316
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,512
There's tea dances and parties,
weddings and bar mitzvahs.

317
00:37:00,684 --> 00:37:04,634
Those things are steady. People always
get married and grow up.

318
00:37:04,813 --> 00:37:07,898
- I don't need the hassle.
- I'll take care of everything...

319
00:37:08,067 --> 00:37:10,225
...just like a regular business manager.

320
00:37:10,402 --> 00:37:14,815
I'll look after the bookings, travel,
costume designs, for 10% off the top.

321
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:17,149
Then a straight split
of the performing cut.

322
00:37:17,326 --> 00:37:21,454
- What costume designs?
- Nothing fancy, just sequins and stuff.

323
00:37:21,622 --> 00:37:25,074
See-through for me, maybe low-cut.
We gotta give them visuals.

324
00:37:25,251 --> 00:37:30,590
The sound might be wicked, but when
you get down to it, tits book bands.

325
00:37:30,757 --> 00:37:34,671
- I think I'll stay in my basement.
- Bruno, this is our chance.

326
00:37:34,844 --> 00:37:40,431
- Don't you want success?
- Sure. I don't think our tits are up to it.

327
00:37:45,939 --> 00:37:47,682
Why?

328
00:37:48,692 --> 00:37:51,397
Oh, why?

329
00:37:53,405 --> 00:37:57,273
God will punish you,
Yuri Yajeyopeyonoff.

330
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:01,952
What crime is this unborn
child guilty of...

331
00:38:02,122 --> 00:38:05,159
...that it should not drink of
the milk of paradise?

332
00:38:05,334 --> 00:38:09,202
You warned me, Elena.
Not one ruble have I lost, not one.

333
00:38:13,426 --> 00:38:18,135
- Can we try this again? It sounds phony.
- I don't wanna try this again.

334
00:38:18,306 --> 00:38:22,351
- There's nothing wrong with you.
- I know. That's what's wrong with me.

335
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:28,308
Everybody here is colorful or eccentric
or charismatic. I'm perfectly ordinary.

336
00:38:28,483 --> 00:38:34,272
My nose is ordinary. My body's ordinary.
And my voice, it's-

337
00:38:34,823 --> 00:38:37,575
- I don't know why I'm here.
- You wanna be an actress.

338
00:38:37,743 --> 00:38:42,203
Yeah, but actors and actresses
are colorful, flamboyant beings.

339
00:38:42,498 --> 00:38:45,783
I'm about as flamboyant as a bagel.

340
00:38:46,335 --> 00:38:47,580
Hi.

341
00:38:47,753 --> 00:38:49,829
- Hi.
- Hi.

342
00:38:50,506 --> 00:38:53,673
- Some people like bagels.
- Some people don't.

343
00:38:53,843 --> 00:38:57,093
- Some people are too old for you.
- He smiles at me.

344
00:38:57,263 --> 00:39:00,347
- He smiles at everyone.
- Yeah, but he winks too.

345
00:39:00,516 --> 00:39:03,850
- I think it's a nervous habit.
- He talks to me, often.

346
00:39:04,145 --> 00:39:06,980
- Really? What's he say?
- Hi.

347
00:39:07,273 --> 00:39:10,476
That's serious. Have you set the date?

348
00:39:13,738 --> 00:39:15,778
I'm sorry.

349
00:39:16,783 --> 00:39:19,155
- I'm sorry.
- I feel stupid.

350
00:39:19,327 --> 00:39:20,407
So get into it.

351
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:22,904
Study it. Try to remember it
so you can-

352
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:24,071
Hey, M and M.

353
00:39:24,249 --> 00:39:26,076
Seen your shrink lately?

354
00:39:26,376 --> 00:39:29,046
- Yesterday.
- You got a special delivery?

355
00:39:29,463 --> 00:39:31,254
How you doing? How are you?

356
00:39:32,633 --> 00:39:35,384
Oh, good. That's very good.
You're a good man.

357
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,889
They're not for me.
They're for a friend of mine.

358
00:39:40,683 --> 00:39:42,177
Who's the lucky fella, huh?

359
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:46,179
Looks like somebody finally
corked up old Finsecker.

360
00:39:46,522 --> 00:39:49,227
It can't be Gloria over here.
He's not into chicks.

361
00:39:53,154 --> 00:39:54,565
Shut my mouth.

362
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:57,230
Bye.

363
00:39:58,618 --> 00:40:01,109
I hate Ralph Garci, I really do.

364
00:40:01,579 --> 00:40:04,249
I must remember this feeling
and use it in my acting.

365
00:40:07,502 --> 00:40:08,747
I'm scared.

366
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:13,582
I'm scared I won't be able to live up
to their expectations of me.

367
00:40:15,969 --> 00:40:18,377
Flashing images of passion-

368
00:40:21,642 --> 00:40:25,770
- and hurl you to the ground
and make mad, passionate love.

369
00:40:26,772 --> 00:40:28,765
- I forgot it!
- For two weeks?

370
00:40:28,941 --> 00:40:31,942
- I told you, I done it and I forgot it.
- My hearing's fine.

371
00:40:32,111 --> 00:40:36,358
It's your homework that's missing.
And these pages are unintelligible.

372
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:40,366
It's a secret language.
It ain't meant for whiteys.

373
00:40:40,536 --> 00:40:42,862
- This isn't a joke.
- I got lots of jokes.

374
00:40:43,206 --> 00:40:45,744
- This is garbage!
- My pen broke.

375
00:40:45,959 --> 00:40:48,960
- It's in pencil.
- That broke too.

376
00:40:49,128 --> 00:40:51,880
You can't learn to read,
you can't learn to dance.

377
00:40:52,132 --> 00:40:54,457
You're flunking out.

378
00:40:54,634 --> 00:40:55,749
I can read.

379
00:40:55,927 --> 00:40:58,881
Terrific! Go ahead, surprise us.
Give him your book.

380
00:40:59,055 --> 00:41:01,428
Pay attention.
Mr. Johnson is gonna read.

381
00:41:02,392 --> 00:41:04,800
- I said I can read!
- Then read.

382
00:41:05,979 --> 00:41:07,473
- No.
- Read!

383
00:41:07,814 --> 00:41:09,143
- No!
- Read!

384
00:41:09,316 --> 00:41:10,691
No, you fucking bitch!

385
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:15,486
What the fuck you want me to do,
asking me to read all the fucking time?

386
00:41:15,656 --> 00:41:18,147
I hate your guts. You read,
you fucking bitch!

387
00:42:27,313 --> 00:42:28,476
It's not natural.

388
00:42:28,648 --> 00:42:30,807
Get off my case, huh, Papa?

389
00:42:31,901 --> 00:42:35,899
When I was your age, Bruno,
I had a lot of girlfriends.

390
00:42:36,072 --> 00:42:39,073
- I had a different girlfriend every day.
- I got music.

391
00:42:40,077 --> 00:42:42,069
Same to you, pal! Go ahead.

392
00:42:42,245 --> 00:42:46,742
Go ahead! Oh, sure, you got music,
okay. But for what? For yourself.

393
00:42:46,875 --> 00:42:47,907
For your headset.

394
00:42:48,168 --> 00:42:51,751
I mean, do I hear it anymore?
Does your mama hear it?

395
00:42:51,922 --> 00:42:53,251
Do your friends hear it?

396
00:42:53,591 --> 00:42:55,667
Bruno, do you have friends? Huh?

397
00:42:55,843 --> 00:42:59,757
- I don't have time. I told you.
- You told me. You told me.

398
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:02,931
It's not natural. When I was your age,
I'm telling you-

399
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:06,101
You're not my age. Nobody's my age.
I'm ahead of my time.

400
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:08,346
Maybe I don't think
people will like my stuff.

401
00:43:08,523 --> 00:43:13,185
How do you know what people will like?
How do they know if they don't hear it?

402
00:43:13,361 --> 00:43:17,110
Bruno, how do they recognize your talent
and give you scholarships...

403
00:43:17,282 --> 00:43:19,607
...and record contracts, son,
and awards?

404
00:43:19,951 --> 00:43:23,534
Maybe I die undiscovered,
and my ghost gets the Grammy.

405
00:43:23,705 --> 00:43:28,284
Maybe! Look, did I build you a studio
in the basement for a ghost?

406
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:32,125
Did I spent $7000 on equipment
for a ghost?

407
00:43:32,381 --> 00:43:37,458
Does your mama cook and clean and
wear old clothes for a ghost? A ghost?

408
00:43:37,636 --> 00:43:41,052
Elton John's mom has got
six mink coats.

409
00:44:53,214 --> 00:44:59,217
"Wel- Wel- Welcome to...

410
00:44:59,387 --> 00:45:03,219
...the wo- Won-

411
00:45:03,391 --> 00:45:07,721
Wonderful...

412
00:45:07,896 --> 00:45:12,226
...world of...

413
00:45:12,401 --> 00:45:18,155
...Ma- Maytag...

414
00:45:18,324 --> 00:45:22,571
...wash- Wash- Washing...

415
00:45:22,745 --> 00:45:25,829
...mach- Ma-

416
00:45:25,998 --> 00:45:28,240
Machines. "

417
00:46:07,625 --> 00:46:08,953
Talk about Shorofsky.

418
00:46:09,126 --> 00:46:14,999
Mr. Shorofsky does not understand any
music past Mozart when he was 2.

419
00:46:15,174 --> 00:46:17,297
They're all the same.
What do you expect?

420
00:46:18,344 --> 00:46:22,971
Graduating from P.A. is no Academy
Award. You know what I mean.

421
00:46:23,725 --> 00:46:27,639
It is better than real school. It's free,
and you don't get raped in the hallways.

422
00:46:27,812 --> 00:46:30,481
But it's still small change.

423
00:46:30,648 --> 00:46:33,982
I'm just killing time here,
waiting for my opportunity.

424
00:46:34,152 --> 00:46:36,904
It might be a movie
or a Broadway musical.

425
00:46:37,072 --> 00:46:39,741
But it's coming. I keep my eyes open.

426
00:46:39,908 --> 00:46:43,075
I read Back Stage, Show Business
and Variety.

427
00:46:43,245 --> 00:46:45,487
You see, I do the whole thing.

428
00:46:45,664 --> 00:46:48,998
Dancing's just the tip
of this iceberg.

429
00:46:49,167 --> 00:46:52,584
A friend of my sister,
she tells fortunes and stuff.

430
00:46:52,755 --> 00:46:56,254
She says I'm doing my last dance
on this dark little planet.

431
00:46:56,425 --> 00:46:58,714
So it's gotta be spectacular, you know?

432
00:46:58,886 --> 00:47:01,591
How bright our spirits
go shooting out into space...

433
00:47:01,764 --> 00:47:06,058
...depends on how much we contributed
to the earthly brilliance of this world.

434
00:47:06,227 --> 00:47:10,094
And I mean to be a major contributor.

435
00:47:11,274 --> 00:47:13,516
A sure-as-shit major contributor.

436
00:47:20,533 --> 00:47:23,285
- Can someone just-?
- She's cleaning her cleavage.

437
00:47:23,453 --> 00:47:27,949
She's taking out the lint. Oh,
that's beautiful. I wish I had a camera.

438
00:47:28,124 --> 00:47:31,410
There she is. Get out of the way.
She's gorgeous.

439
00:47:31,586 --> 00:47:33,875
Oh, now turn around, please.

440
00:47:34,214 --> 00:47:35,792
Oh, please.

441
00:47:35,966 --> 00:47:37,544
Oh, look at those tits.

442
00:47:37,885 --> 00:47:39,462
Oh, you could drown in those.

443
00:47:39,636 --> 00:47:45,058
I want you to observe yourself
doing ordinary, everyday things.

444
00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:48,229
You'll be asked to duplicate
those here in class.

445
00:47:48,395 --> 00:47:50,768
An actor must develop
an acute sense memory...

446
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:55,401
...so concentrate on how you deal
with things in your world...

447
00:47:55,569 --> 00:47:59,817
...how you wash your face
or hold your fork or lift your cup...

448
00:47:59,991 --> 00:48:05,495
...comb your hair. Observe and study
your own mechanicalness.

449
00:48:05,663 --> 00:48:10,491
See if you can catch yourself in the
very act of doing or saying something.

450
00:48:11,669 --> 00:48:16,581
See if your actions and reactions fall into
patterns and what those patterns are.

451
00:48:16,758 --> 00:48:20,507
And in particular, pay close attention
to the physical world.

452
00:48:20,679 --> 00:48:24,842
Isolate and concentrate on the details.

453
00:48:36,695 --> 00:48:39,269
Oh, mamacita!

454
00:48:43,786 --> 00:48:45,364
Ay, caramba!

455
00:48:52,795 --> 00:48:56,378
No! No! No! Give me that!

456
00:48:56,549 --> 00:48:59,219
You must hold your bow like this,
not like that.

457
00:48:59,385 --> 00:49:01,259
It's not your dick you're holding.

458
00:49:01,429 --> 00:49:05,723
Excuse me, miss. It's a violin bow.
Hold it with a little respect, like-

459
00:49:05,892 --> 00:49:07,801
Like your dick?

460
00:49:07,978 --> 00:49:10,220
Shut up. Again.

461
00:49:41,346 --> 00:49:44,430
Watch your plié, Coco.

462
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:49,265
Turn out the arch, Leroy.

463
00:49:49,771 --> 00:49:51,265
Nice, Neisha.

464
00:49:52,774 --> 00:49:54,980
I want to see the leg, Patrick.

465
00:49:55,151 --> 00:49:58,437
And stretch.

466
00:50:00,365 --> 00:50:02,025
Good.

467
00:50:03,452 --> 00:50:05,195
Keep it together now.

468
00:50:10,209 --> 00:50:14,207
Where's the sweat, Lisa?
You're not even trying.

469
00:50:29,395 --> 00:50:32,313
- Michael, congratulations. I heard.
- Oh, thank you.

470
00:50:32,482 --> 00:50:35,649
Don't thank me. You deserved
the award and the scholarship.

471
00:50:35,819 --> 00:50:38,226
You are the best actor in the school.

472
00:50:38,405 --> 00:50:41,322
Well, you were the best actor
in the school.

473
00:50:41,491 --> 00:50:43,733
I mean, we'll miss you.

474
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:45,239
Well, I'll miss you too.

475
00:50:45,495 --> 00:50:46,824
- You will?
- Yeah, sure.

476
00:50:46,997 --> 00:50:49,322
- We'll keep in touch, I guess, huh?
- Yeah.

477
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:51,160
Would you sign my yearbook?

478
00:50:51,335 --> 00:50:54,917
Yeah, all right. Do you
want me to sign my picture?

479
00:50:55,088 --> 00:50:57,710
- That'd be great.
- Oh, okay.

480
00:50:58,258 --> 00:51:00,417
- I forgot. What's your name?
- Doris Finsecker.

481
00:51:00,594 --> 00:51:02,753
- Oh, right. Doris.
- But Doris is enough.

482
00:51:02,888 --> 00:51:03,919
Oh, okay.

483
00:51:04,098 --> 00:51:06,671
- Have you decided where you're going?
- California.

484
00:51:06,851 --> 00:51:09,935
- I mean to college, the scholarship.
- I can't use it.

485
00:51:10,104 --> 00:51:12,856
- How come?
- William Morris has got big plans for me.

486
00:51:13,024 --> 00:51:15,776
- They saw me in that Senior Day show.
- You're kidding?

487
00:51:15,943 --> 00:51:19,028
- They wanna represent me.
- They're the biggest agents.

488
00:51:19,197 --> 00:51:21,273
- Yeah.
- Well, that's great!

489
00:51:22,575 --> 00:51:25,113
There's a couple of series
they think I'm right for.

490
00:51:25,286 --> 00:51:29,035
I've had a lot of really good meetings.
Everyone's very excited.

491
00:51:29,207 --> 00:51:31,877
That is so great!
I mean, Hollywood, that's like-

492
00:51:32,043 --> 00:51:37,630
Yeah. Well, here I go,
off into the sunset.

493
00:51:37,799 --> 00:51:40,041
Hey, good luck. Oh, sorry.

494
00:51:40,218 --> 00:51:43,967
I mean, break a leg,
or whatever they say.

495
00:51:46,475 --> 00:51:48,053
See you.

496
00:51:49,144 --> 00:51:50,971
Hey!

497
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,974
We'll see you at Schwab's.

498
00:51:57,153 --> 00:51:58,730
Oh, God, Doris!

499
00:52:12,585 --> 00:52:14,744
She's new. I saw her arrive
in a limousine.

500
00:52:14,921 --> 00:52:17,246
A limousine? No kidding?

501
00:52:18,592 --> 00:52:21,925
- Man, I hope to fuck she's in drama.
- No way. Dance department.

502
00:52:22,095 --> 00:52:24,586
She's too beautiful. Look at that ass.

503
00:52:24,765 --> 00:52:28,928
- I don't know about her tits.
- What do you mean? What kind of tits?

504
00:52:31,605 --> 00:52:34,013
- Tits... Pointy ones?
- She looks kind of flat.

505
00:52:34,191 --> 00:52:35,436
She's fucking gorgeous!

506
00:52:35,609 --> 00:52:37,851
Little-bitty ones
with nips like raisins?

507
00:52:38,028 --> 00:52:40,436
She's turning around. Look at that ass.

508
00:52:40,614 --> 00:52:43,615
- Oh, she is a dancer.
- Let me up. Let me up!

509
00:52:48,205 --> 00:52:50,697
Let me see, you fuckers.

510
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:02,969
Last year, we worked
on simple observations.

511
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:07,800
This year, we're going to turn
that observation inward...

512
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:10,811
...and work on re-creating
emotional states:

513
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:14,893
Fear, joy, sorrow, anger.

514
00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:20,274
And it'll be more difficult because you'll
have to expose more of you...

515
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:23,234
...what's on the inside of you.

516
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:26,326
For your first acting exercise
this year, I want you...

517
00:53:26,495 --> 00:53:29,829
...to re-create a difficult memory...

518
00:53:29,999 --> 00:53:34,661
...a painful moment when you learned
something about yourself that hurt.

519
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:38,253
And I mean really hurt.

520
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:40,500
And reach.

521
00:53:41,344 --> 00:53:44,428
And through. And drop.

522
00:53:44,597 --> 00:53:47,005
And back.

523
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:55,229
Hi, I'm Lisa Monroe.

524
00:53:56,443 --> 00:53:57,771
Hilary van Doren.

525
00:53:58,111 --> 00:53:59,440
I love your coat.

526
00:53:59,613 --> 00:54:01,237
I saw that in Bendel's window.

527
00:54:02,366 --> 00:54:06,114
- My stepmother bought it for me.
- Really?

528
00:54:06,286 --> 00:54:09,287
I wouldn't mind that kind of stepmother.

529
00:54:09,957 --> 00:54:13,789
She didn't do it for me.
She wants my father to think she cares.

530
00:54:13,961 --> 00:54:16,713
Besides, she loves shopping.

531
00:54:16,881 --> 00:54:20,131
She gets multiple orgasm
every time she buys something.

532
00:54:20,634 --> 00:54:22,793
Sounds great. I think I like her.

533
00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:24,299
You can have her.

534
00:54:24,722 --> 00:54:28,221
- Where's all the sweat, Lisa?
- I'm working on it.

535
00:54:28,726 --> 00:54:31,051
You're not working on it hard enough.

536
00:54:31,229 --> 00:54:33,268
Get rid of the gum.

537
00:54:44,576 --> 00:54:46,118
Watch me.

538
00:54:48,663 --> 00:54:50,656
Lift the bow off the string, Martelli.

539
00:54:51,166 --> 00:54:53,242
Mozart wouldn't do this today.

540
00:54:53,418 --> 00:54:55,577
- Do what?
- This bowing business.

541
00:54:55,754 --> 00:54:57,711
He'd plug his keyboard into an amp...

542
00:54:57,881 --> 00:55:01,085
...and he'd have string quartets
coming out of his fingers.

543
00:55:01,427 --> 00:55:04,677
And who would play all these
science-fiction symphonies?

544
00:55:05,264 --> 00:55:07,506
- He would.
- All by himself?

545
00:55:07,933 --> 00:55:11,599
He'd overdub and mix, of course.
He wouldn't make the same old noise.

546
00:55:11,771 --> 00:55:13,680
- Noise?
- He'd sound electric.

547
00:55:13,856 --> 00:55:18,150
He'd have spacier strings and horns
and computerized bassoons.

548
00:55:18,611 --> 00:55:21,647
- One man is not an orchestra.
- Who needs orchestras?

549
00:55:21,823 --> 00:55:26,117
You can do it all with a keyboard,
an amp and enough power.

550
00:55:26,703 --> 00:55:29,075
You're going to play all by yourself?

551
00:55:29,247 --> 00:55:30,706
You don't need anybody else.

552
00:55:31,124 --> 00:55:34,707
That's not music, Martelli.
That's masturbation.

553
00:55:36,713 --> 00:55:39,383
See, I'm not naturally graceful.

554
00:55:39,716 --> 00:55:41,839
Grace doesn't run in our family.

555
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:45,960
It's our genes. I've had to work
so hard to come this far.

556
00:55:46,139 --> 00:55:49,057
- God, I've been at it since I was 4.
- Me too.

557
00:55:49,226 --> 00:55:51,219
I started out with tap and stuff.

558
00:55:51,395 --> 00:55:55,393
Then my mom kept buying me pretty
ballet tutus, and I got hooked on it.

559
00:55:55,566 --> 00:55:58,401
Less lip, Monroe! More sweat!

560
00:55:58,986 --> 00:56:01,311
- She's just a bitch.
- She hates me.

561
00:56:01,489 --> 00:56:05,189
This is a dance class, Lisa,
not the Charles Atlas plan.

562
00:56:05,493 --> 00:56:08,826
- Shut your mouth.
- Where are your tights?

563
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,156
I told you I got them.
I just forgot them.

564
00:56:11,332 --> 00:56:12,992
What's he talking about?

565
00:56:13,167 --> 00:56:15,326
Tights. He won't wear them.

566
00:56:16,671 --> 00:56:21,417
Look, Leroy, I told you, if you don't have
tights, you don't dance. Now go!

567
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:27,386
Oh, I love your accent.
What did you say?

568
00:56:27,557 --> 00:56:29,182
I dig his black ass.

569
00:56:29,351 --> 00:56:33,847
- It's taken, Goldilocks.
- Don't count on it.

570
00:56:44,366 --> 00:56:45,695
A painful memory.

571
00:56:45,868 --> 00:56:48,620
What does he mean by
a painful memory?

572
00:56:48,788 --> 00:56:51,195
I don't know. I can't find
a painful memory.

573
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:52,784
I know I have them.

574
00:56:52,959 --> 00:56:55,876
I mean, my pain's as good
as anybody else's.

575
00:56:56,045 --> 00:56:59,295
I have lots of them. You can borrow
one of mine if you want.

576
00:56:59,465 --> 00:57:04,127
Like, I used to wet my bed. There, that
was painful. You can have that memory.

577
00:57:04,304 --> 00:57:05,632
No, thank you.

578
00:57:05,805 --> 00:57:09,803
Then there was the last time my father
packed his bags and left us.

579
00:57:09,976 --> 00:57:11,885
That really was painful.

580
00:57:12,062 --> 00:57:17,816
Or the first time my mother flew to L.A.
and didn't come back for six weeks.

581
00:57:18,068 --> 00:57:20,903
Or the first time I fell in love.

582
00:57:21,071 --> 00:57:23,479
Where'd that come from?

583
00:57:24,074 --> 00:57:26,150
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

584
00:59:02,926 --> 00:59:04,586
You're gonna tell everybody that?

585
00:59:05,262 --> 00:59:07,753
It's the most painful memory
I can think of.

586
00:59:07,932 --> 00:59:10,683
He didn't say the most painful.
He just said painful.

587
00:59:10,851 --> 00:59:14,849
- We're supposed to expose ourselves.
- Imagine what Ralph Garci will say.

588
00:59:15,189 --> 00:59:19,685
A pie in the face comes with the job.
That's what my mom says. She knows.

589
00:59:19,861 --> 00:59:21,106
I don't get it.

590
00:59:21,279 --> 00:59:25,323
A real artist must never be afraid of
what other people will say about him.

591
00:59:25,491 --> 00:59:28,279
It was a time when I realized
something about myself.

592
00:59:28,536 --> 00:59:31,371
- Maybe you didn't realize it right.
- What do you mean?

593
00:59:31,623 --> 00:59:35,407
Well, I mean, everybody falls in love
with their analyst.

594
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:38,380
There's a word for that, isn't there?

595
00:59:38,547 --> 00:59:41,038
Homosexual.

596
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:38,684
That's my music.

597
01:00:38,859 --> 01:00:40,686
That lunatic stole my tape.

598
01:00:50,454 --> 01:00:51,913
Wow, that's me.

599
01:00:53,290 --> 01:00:58,878
That's my son's music!
My son Bruno. Bruno Martelli!

600
01:00:59,046 --> 01:01:03,127
He wrote the music.
Today, 46th Street...

601
01:01:03,301 --> 01:01:06,587
...tomorrow, Madison Square Garden.

602
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:15,014
- Papa, what are you doing?
- Bruno!

603
01:01:15,188 --> 01:01:18,557
You've lost your mind. You're crazy.
Those tapes aren't ready.

604
01:01:18,733 --> 01:01:22,067
Look at the people.
They don't know it's not ready.

605
01:01:22,237 --> 01:01:26,282
Look at it, they like it!
Bruno, they like it! Bruno!

606
01:01:55,772 --> 01:01:58,726
- Hey, yo!
- Huh?

607
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:02,768
Move your fucking parade!
What do you think this is, 5th Avenue?

608
01:02:02,868 --> 01:02:04,695
Back it up!

609
01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:10,991
I'll get your ass, buddy!
Who do you think you are?

610
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:20,921
You're next, you hear me?

611
01:02:21,095 --> 01:02:23,847
Get away from there.
What are you doing?

612
01:02:24,015 --> 01:02:25,557
How do you like that?

613
01:02:25,725 --> 01:02:28,014
Pick that up, you son of a bitch!

614
01:03:04,758 --> 01:03:08,091
I thought I was just
going through a stage.

615
01:03:09,429 --> 01:03:11,671
That's what everyone told me.

616
01:03:11,848 --> 01:03:14,885
And it never
worried me when I was 10.

617
01:03:15,894 --> 01:03:20,603
Except they told me the same thing
at 12 and 14.

618
01:03:23,485 --> 01:03:28,728
So finally, my analyst
leveled with me.

619
01:03:28,991 --> 01:03:32,574
He said it was probably a life choice.

620
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:40,458
It's funny.

621
01:03:42,379 --> 01:03:47,456
"Gay" used to mean
such a happy kind of word once.

622
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:54,559
Not that it bothers me.
I'm pretty well-adjusted, really.

623
01:03:56,519 --> 01:03:58,559
I mean...

624
01:04:01,441 --> 01:04:04,311
...never being happy...

625
01:04:04,694 --> 01:04:08,145
...isn't the same as being unhappy.

626
01:04:08,406 --> 01:04:10,565
Is it?

627
01:04:12,994 --> 01:04:16,328
Dr. Golden explains it real well.

628
01:04:17,582 --> 01:04:19,456
He explains everything well.

629
01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:25,172
I've had a lot of help.

630
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:40,688
Hey, Doris, you wanna go to
The Rocky Horror Show tomorrow night?

631
01:04:40,856 --> 01:04:42,101
That sounds great.

632
01:04:42,274 --> 01:04:46,521
It starts at midnight, so you better
check it out with your mom.

633
01:04:46,695 --> 01:04:50,527
Calling Montgomery MacNeil.

634
01:04:50,699 --> 01:04:53,784
Oh, Montgomery.

635
01:05:00,209 --> 01:05:03,376
I suppose that a fuck
is out of the question?

636
01:05:03,546 --> 01:05:06,500
There he is, Ralph Garci,
right on the button.

637
01:05:06,674 --> 01:05:08,797
- Nice.
- Get off!

638
01:05:08,968 --> 01:05:14,045
- I warned you this would happen.
- It's your case, man. I don't give a fuck.

639
01:05:14,224 --> 01:05:17,308
- It's a joke, that's all. It just came out.
- Like me.

640
01:05:17,477 --> 01:05:21,806
Yeah. Hey, Doris, listen,
I meant to tell you.

641
01:05:21,982 --> 01:05:26,229
There's an open call for a movie
at the Diplomat Hotel.

642
01:05:26,403 --> 01:05:29,772
- Oh, yeah?
- They're looking for your type.

643
01:05:29,948 --> 01:05:32,700
- What's my type?
- You know, your type.

644
01:05:32,868 --> 01:05:37,245
- Irishy, Jewishy, paranoid.
- What's the name of this movie?

645
01:05:37,414 --> 01:05:41,743
- I Was a Teenage Fag Hag.
- You shit!

646
01:05:45,255 --> 01:05:46,287
Stop it!

647
01:05:46,465 --> 01:05:49,300
I never knew it would
be like this, Doris.

648
01:05:49,468 --> 01:05:53,513
Oh, come closer, sweetheart.
Oh, my, such embrace.

649
01:05:59,061 --> 01:06:02,098
The Silvermans know
some very important people.

650
01:06:02,273 --> 01:06:06,105
They really have connections.
They're mishpoche with Soupy Sales.

651
01:06:06,277 --> 01:06:09,112
Oh, listen.
Your nice white blouse is ironed.

652
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:12,696
Or you could wear your pink dress
with the ribbons.

653
01:06:12,867 --> 01:06:15,904
- You look so pretty in that.
- I hate that pink dress.

654
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:18,914
- So don't wear your pink dress.
- I'm not going, Mama!

655
01:06:19,123 --> 01:06:21,081
- Then gargle.
- I'm going out to dinner!

656
01:06:21,251 --> 01:06:24,121
- It's a catered affair.
- It's not the food!

657
01:06:24,379 --> 01:06:26,704
This is an opportunity to perform.

658
01:06:26,881 --> 01:06:29,882
- Take advantage of it.
- I promised Montgomery!

659
01:06:30,051 --> 01:06:33,052
Well, I promised the Silvermans!

660
01:06:36,058 --> 01:06:39,890
It's a party, Doris.
They need a singer.

661
01:06:40,062 --> 01:06:44,937
And you, you need exposure.
So you're going.

662
01:06:45,442 --> 01:06:47,435
I'm not!

663
01:07:33,742 --> 01:07:37,490
Very good, Doris.
What did you realize about yourself?

664
01:07:39,456 --> 01:07:43,619
I don't like birthday parties.
Or pink dresses.

665
01:07:44,586 --> 01:07:47,920
Or the Silvermans. Or Brooklyn.

666
01:07:48,090 --> 01:07:50,581
Or even being Jewish.

667
01:07:50,884 --> 01:07:52,544
I mean, it's not bad...

668
01:07:53,262 --> 01:07:55,753
...but it's not all I am.

669
01:07:55,931 --> 01:08:00,308
I don't know who I am,
and I never will if I don't assert myself.

670
01:08:00,477 --> 01:08:04,974
I'm 16 years old.
I've got to assert myself sometime.

671
01:08:07,401 --> 01:08:09,145
Don't I?

672
01:08:09,570 --> 01:08:11,693
Okay, Doris. Ralph?

673
01:08:13,699 --> 01:08:16,570
I was coming home from
school one day.

674
01:08:16,744 --> 01:08:17,989
As usual.

675
01:08:18,746 --> 01:08:23,704
I had a couple of pieces of business
to attend to in the neighborhood.

676
01:08:24,877 --> 01:08:27,036
It was January.

677
01:08:27,547 --> 01:08:29,955
It was snowing like crazy.

678
01:08:32,761 --> 01:08:35,927
Santa Claus just ripped
everybody off.

679
01:08:36,431 --> 01:08:39,515
He split for Toy Town or Igloo City...

680
01:08:39,684 --> 01:08:42,934
...or the North Pole
or wherever the hell he goes.

681
01:08:45,607 --> 01:08:47,730
So anyway...

682
01:08:48,944 --> 01:08:51,945
I was going home, and...

683
01:08:54,157 --> 01:08:56,234
I found this note.

684
01:08:56,660 --> 01:08:59,233
It said my two chicks were in church.

685
01:08:59,413 --> 01:09:02,782
What the hell are my two chicks
doing in church?

686
01:09:04,126 --> 01:09:06,451
Somebody die or something?

687
01:09:08,839 --> 01:09:13,667
That was... That was a joke.
That was supposed to be a joke.

688
01:09:20,476 --> 01:09:24,011
Anyway, I went home.

689
01:09:26,899 --> 01:09:32,107
I dropped a little incense like
I always do, just to unwind a little bit.

690
01:09:34,657 --> 01:09:37,327
And I put on the TV set.

691
01:09:40,246 --> 01:09:43,413
And there was
this guy on the TV.

692
01:09:46,628 --> 01:09:49,249
And he was talking
about Freddie.

693
01:09:52,592 --> 01:09:56,507
He... He said that...

694
01:09:58,181 --> 01:10:03,971
He said that Freddie Prinze
put a gun to his head...

695
01:10:04,146 --> 01:10:08,274
...and he killed himself.

696
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:15,154
You know, it was an accident, man.

697
01:10:16,742 --> 01:10:20,526
Shit, I mean, he was fucking...
He was very gifted.

698
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:26,788
You always laughed at him
because he was very fucking talented.

699
01:10:30,089 --> 01:10:33,957
And sometimes you didn't even
wanna laugh at him...

700
01:10:34,135 --> 01:10:36,211
...and you laughed at him anyway.

701
01:10:37,096 --> 01:10:39,219
But those motherfuckers...

702
01:10:39,390 --> 01:10:42,226
...they had to say that
he was depressed...

703
01:10:42,393 --> 01:10:45,976
...and he was suicidal,
and that he was fucked up.

704
01:10:46,147 --> 01:10:50,893
They wanted his fucking ass, man.
They wanted to nail his ass.

705
01:10:51,069 --> 01:10:55,197
Because he didn't think living
was such a happy trip, you know?

706
01:10:56,867 --> 01:11:00,401
We can't have happy people
walking on this planet.

707
01:11:00,579 --> 01:11:03,615
Everybody's gotta be
so goddamn serious.

708
01:11:03,790 --> 01:11:06,246
Everyone's gotta stay in business...

709
01:11:06,418 --> 01:11:10,914
...and suffer so the witch doctors
and the deodorant-spray people...

710
01:11:11,090 --> 01:11:14,340
...and plastic surgeons
could stay in business.

711
01:11:14,510 --> 01:11:18,424
And we can all go fucking pray
to the asshole God up there...

712
01:11:18,597 --> 01:11:21,634
...that fucked it up
in the first place!

713
01:11:26,272 --> 01:11:30,270
Does all this make you
realize anything about yourself?

714
01:11:30,568 --> 01:11:34,103
- What?
- How does it affect you?

715
01:11:35,239 --> 01:11:37,565
How does it affect me?

716
01:11:38,576 --> 01:11:41,447
I'm here,
and I'm in this fucking school.

717
01:11:41,621 --> 01:11:44,657
And I'm fucking everybody back
for Freddie!

718
01:11:44,832 --> 01:11:46,659
Take it easy, Ralph.

719
01:11:46,835 --> 01:11:50,168
You want them laughing
with you, not at you.

720
01:11:50,505 --> 01:11:52,581
I don't want them laughing.

721
01:12:04,978 --> 01:12:06,556
Leroy?

722
01:12:07,272 --> 01:12:08,303
Ma'am?

723
01:12:08,815 --> 01:12:11,057
What are you wearing, Leroy?

724
01:12:11,485 --> 01:12:14,486
- A hat.
- On your feet, Leroy.

725
01:12:14,655 --> 01:12:18,818
Oh, those. You like them? They get me
to class quicker, get more learning in.

726
01:12:18,992 --> 01:12:21,828
- What about your book report?
- I done it.

727
01:12:21,996 --> 01:12:25,162
- You did it.
-1000 words. I counted them too.

728
01:12:25,332 --> 01:12:28,832
- The Best of Playboy isn't a book report.
- It's reading, ain't it?

729
01:12:29,003 --> 01:12:33,961
So is 1984, Huckleberry Finn,
Great Expectations. You heard of those?

730
01:12:34,133 --> 01:12:36,007
I seen a couple of the movies.

731
01:12:36,177 --> 01:12:39,344
If you don't read,
you're missing so much.

732
01:12:39,514 --> 01:12:45,303
- I don't like reading. It's not my style.
- Then try Othello. He's black.

733
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:48,847
-1000 words in two weeks.
- Or what?

734
01:12:49,023 --> 01:12:52,807
Or you'll skate right out of
this school, Mr. Johnson.

735
01:13:09,336 --> 01:13:11,079
Come in.

736
01:13:13,048 --> 01:13:17,212
- Miss Berg, you wanted to see me?
- Come and sit down, Lisa.

737
01:13:23,559 --> 01:13:26,310
You're not working hard enough, Lisa.

738
01:13:26,812 --> 01:13:29,564
Well, I've been sick.

739
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:32,396
Dancers don't get sick.

740
01:13:33,110 --> 01:13:34,902
Well, my doctor told me...

741
01:13:35,071 --> 01:13:38,736
...to take it easy
for a week or two until I feel okay.

742
01:13:38,908 --> 01:13:43,202
- So now it's the doctor's fault?
- Don't you believe me?

743
01:13:43,371 --> 01:13:44,865
I believe you, Lisa.

744
01:13:45,081 --> 01:13:48,948
But I don't have room
for you in this class anymore.

745
01:13:49,127 --> 01:13:51,534
But I brought a doctor's note.

746
01:13:51,713 --> 01:13:55,580
There are too many other girls
who take dance seriously...

747
01:13:55,758 --> 01:13:59,044
...to waste time and space
on someone who isn't dedicated.

748
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:03,384
- But I am dedicated.
- I'm sorry, Lisa. I don't see it.

749
01:14:04,225 --> 01:14:06,930
I got into this school, didn't I?

750
01:14:07,103 --> 01:14:10,769
We made a mistake.
Sometimes it just doesn't work out.

751
01:14:10,941 --> 01:14:14,144
- You'll get over it.
- I'll work harder.

752
01:14:14,319 --> 01:14:17,106
- Maybe.
- I promise I'll be better.

753
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,439
Better isn't good enough.

754
01:14:19,616 --> 01:14:23,910
I don't think you'll ever
be good enough. You don't have it.

755
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:29,370
That's a hard thing to hear, and it's not
pleasant to say, but it's the truth.

756
01:14:29,543 --> 01:14:33,411
I'm saving you a lot of time and pain
by saying it now.

757
01:14:33,923 --> 01:14:36,710
I don't wanna be the best.

758
01:14:37,468 --> 01:14:40,635
- Well, you won't be.
- I just wanna dance.

759
01:14:41,972 --> 01:14:47,215
- Well, you'll never be a Mikhail, Lisa.
- I can't fail, Miss Berg.

760
01:14:47,395 --> 01:14:51,642
- I only ever wanted to be a dancer.
- You'll get over it.

761
01:14:51,816 --> 01:14:57,023
- What do I tell my mother?
- Have her call me and I'll explain.

762
01:16:26,163 --> 01:16:29,911
Fuck it. If I can't dance,
I'll change to the drama department.

763
01:16:30,417 --> 01:16:33,751
I tell you,
you're a fucking good actress.

764
01:16:40,386 --> 01:16:43,755
I heard the bitch came down
on her real hard.

765
01:16:43,931 --> 01:16:47,549
- So? Life comes down hard.
- She just took a real bad dump, kid.

766
01:16:49,603 --> 01:16:53,767
Better she realizes it now
than OD in some motel room at 30.

767
01:16:53,941 --> 01:16:56,693
You might show
a little more sympathy, dear.

768
01:16:57,028 --> 01:17:00,147
- I'm not "dear. "
- Evidemment.

769
01:17:00,323 --> 01:17:02,648
You're not très sensitive either.

770
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:04,195
I'm a professional.

771
01:17:04,368 --> 01:17:08,069
A few unkind words aren't
going to bother me none.

772
01:17:08,581 --> 01:17:13,290
- I know it won't all be standing ovations.
- Certainly not for you, my dear.

773
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:16,453
Look, I'm not "my dear. "
You can fuck "my dear. "

774
01:17:16,631 --> 01:17:20,878
Well, thank you. That might be fun.

775
01:17:23,763 --> 01:17:28,057
And that might be impossible.
He's not into vanilla.

776
01:17:28,226 --> 01:17:30,266
Might be a nice change
from black cherry.

777
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:33,806
The darker the berry,
the sweeter the juice, honey.

778
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:37,600
Yes, but who wants diabetes?

779
01:17:42,116 --> 01:17:45,650
I mean, you don't understand.
Listen to me, man.

780
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:49,327
Diction. Watch your diction, Ralph.
You're slurring your words.

781
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:54,326
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Marlon Brando slurred his words.

782
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:57,789
Montgomery Clift and
James Dean slurred their words.

783
01:17:57,965 --> 01:18:02,093
They were the greatest actors in the
world. Nobody could understand them.

784
01:18:03,304 --> 01:18:05,629
Wait a second. What's so funny?

785
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:20,941
Hey, it's Raul.
Where's my two chicks, huh?

786
01:18:28,538 --> 01:18:32,287
Look at you! You got so big!
Where is Mom? Is she home?

787
01:19:01,447 --> 01:19:03,689
Hey, cupcake. Come here, cupcake.

788
01:19:03,866 --> 01:19:07,698
Faggot.
That's what you are now, man.

789
01:19:08,079 --> 01:19:10,996
What you doing? Whoa! Damn, man.

790
01:19:55,586 --> 01:19:58,919
Martelli! Bruno Martelli!

791
01:20:01,717 --> 01:20:03,425
Shit!

792
01:20:09,141 --> 01:20:12,641
In the beginning
she's not in love with him-

793
01:20:12,812 --> 01:20:14,970
- God, you live here, Montgomery?
- Yeah.

794
01:20:15,147 --> 01:20:17,603
- This is a great pad.
- You like it?

795
01:20:17,775 --> 01:20:21,310
It's great. What happened to all
your furniture? You get ripped off?

796
01:20:21,487 --> 01:20:24,109
- It closed in Cincinnati.
- What's that mean?

797
01:20:24,282 --> 01:20:27,817
My mom kept saying she was gonna
fix it up when she got into a long run.

798
01:20:27,994 --> 01:20:30,663
- She's got a lousy choice in plays.
- It's perfect.

799
01:20:30,830 --> 01:20:35,492
We don't need nothing for rehearsal.
Ready when you are, Mr. Director.

800
01:20:35,668 --> 01:20:40,165
- All right, page one, Act 1.
- All right, page one, Act 1.

801
01:21:14,875 --> 01:21:17,164
Raul?

802
01:21:43,071 --> 01:21:45,229
Raul?

803
01:21:59,588 --> 01:22:04,250
If you're kicked around long enough,
you get to be a real professor of pain.

804
01:22:04,426 --> 01:22:08,341
I know how you feel.
But I'm having a real good time now.

805
01:22:08,514 --> 01:22:10,091
I'm enjoying myself.

806
01:22:10,265 --> 01:22:13,266
So you see, you're not such
a dog as you think you are.

807
01:22:13,435 --> 01:22:15,594
I'm having a very good time too.

808
01:22:15,771 --> 01:22:19,603
So there you are. I'm not such a dog
as I think I am.

809
01:22:19,775 --> 01:22:21,934
I think you're a very nice guy.

810
01:22:22,111 --> 01:22:25,646
I don't know why
a girl hasn't grabbed you.

811
01:22:25,823 --> 01:22:30,319
Yeah, I don't either. I am a nice guy.

812
01:22:30,578 --> 01:22:33,413
I'm also a real smart guy too.

813
01:22:41,548 --> 01:22:45,960
Wait. There's a whole speech yet.
You're not supposed to kiss yet.

814
01:22:48,722 --> 01:22:53,467
Ralph. Doris. Ralph, you have a whole
speech here you haven't even done.

815
01:22:53,643 --> 01:22:56,431
Ralph, you're not supposed to kiss yet.

816
01:23:03,654 --> 01:23:06,489
My mother was French
and very beautiful.

817
01:23:06,657 --> 01:23:12,327
Straight out of some chateau.
She danced every night for hours.

818
01:23:12,496 --> 01:23:16,494
Daddy was in Washington
or out to dinner with clients...

819
01:23:16,667 --> 01:23:20,166
...while Mom was with Tchaikovsky,
Ravel, Mantovani.

820
01:23:20,337 --> 01:23:24,038
You'll meet my stepmother, Claudia.
Trainee witch.

821
01:23:24,216 --> 01:23:27,835
No cracks about being Chinese.
She's had her eyes fixed.

822
01:23:28,012 --> 01:23:31,511
She recuperated in Palm Springs,
where she had her purse stolen.

823
01:23:31,682 --> 01:23:34,434
She lost all her credit cards.

824
01:23:34,977 --> 01:23:39,639
Dad doesn't want to report it, though.
The thief is spending less than she did.

825
01:23:47,407 --> 01:23:49,316
Hi, Daddy.

826
01:23:51,035 --> 01:23:52,411
Hi.

827
01:23:53,038 --> 01:23:56,204
Oh, this is Leroy. Homework.

828
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:17,660
That was nice. Really.

829
01:27:18,081 --> 01:27:20,833
Sentimental shit.

830
01:27:21,752 --> 01:27:24,243
That was beautiful!

831
01:27:25,422 --> 01:27:28,589
That was beautiful.

832
01:27:28,967 --> 01:27:31,209
It was beautiful.

833
01:27:38,852 --> 01:27:42,435
- Yeah, this is it here.
- You live here?

834
01:27:42,606 --> 01:27:45,441
My sister lives here.
I'm always welcome.

835
01:27:45,609 --> 01:27:47,152
- Very nice place.
- Yeah.

836
01:27:47,319 --> 01:27:51,269
They're very fancy, huh?
I'll wait till you get inside.

837
01:27:51,449 --> 01:27:53,655
No. It's okay. Really.

838
01:27:53,826 --> 01:27:56,151
- Okay.
- It's a good neighborhood.

839
01:27:56,329 --> 01:28:00,576
- It's not much, but-
- Please, come on. That's not necessary.

840
01:28:00,750 --> 01:28:02,209
I should pay you.

841
01:28:02,377 --> 01:28:06,706
You know, I play your tapes
for my customers, you know.

842
01:28:06,881 --> 01:28:12,421
They love that stuff.
My tips go up 20%, at least.

843
01:28:13,304 --> 01:28:17,136
- And my son is happy.
- He's writing some good shit too.

844
01:28:17,309 --> 01:28:20,974
We're gonna be all over the charts
one of these days.

845
01:28:21,146 --> 01:28:25,772
- You make him happy, you know that?
- We're a hot team, you know.

846
01:28:25,942 --> 01:28:30,651
- You make him hotter. You know?
- Sure.

847
01:28:30,822 --> 01:28:35,734
I seem to have that effect on people.
What can I do? Thanks again.

848
01:28:35,911 --> 01:28:38,484
- Good night, Bruno.
- Night. Take it easy.

849
01:30:04,502 --> 01:30:05,996
You're crazy.

850
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:07,583
You call a doctor?

851
01:30:07,922 --> 01:30:09,085
I don't think she's hurt.

852
01:30:09,382 --> 01:30:11,505
Since when are you
in the thinking business?

853
01:30:11,884 --> 01:30:13,047
She's frightened.

854
01:30:13,344 --> 01:30:16,594
- She's 5 fucking years old!
- Please keep your voice down.

855
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:22,134
- You're in a church, my son.
- You're in the Dark Ages!

856
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:24,848
You kiss my ass, Padre.

857
01:30:25,523 --> 01:30:30,232
She needs a doctor! A doctor!
Not the goddamn Holy Ghost!

858
01:30:55,012 --> 01:30:57,088
Is she all right?

859
01:31:01,268 --> 01:31:04,139
You're not attacked by a creep
at 5 years old and all right.

860
01:31:04,605 --> 01:31:06,265
I'm sorry.

861
01:31:06,565 --> 01:31:09,317
Doris, I wasn't there!
I wasn't fucking there!

862
01:31:09,777 --> 01:31:10,940
What about your father?

863
01:31:11,487 --> 01:31:13,812
I happen to be between
fathers right now.

864
01:31:13,990 --> 01:31:15,318
What does that mean?

865
01:31:15,992 --> 01:31:18,068
You got to understand something.

866
01:31:18,661 --> 01:31:21,615
You got to understand
the Puerto Rican woman.

867
01:31:23,416 --> 01:31:25,159
She thinks about
the kids...

868
01:31:25,335 --> 01:31:29,463
...how they gotta have a father.
Love has nothing to do with it.

869
01:31:30,340 --> 01:31:32,582
My mom has an extra room.
She rents it out.

870
01:31:32,759 --> 01:31:35,677
Next thing you know,
I've got a new father.

871
01:31:41,518 --> 01:31:44,969
They're all right, mostly.
They may stay a day...

872
01:31:45,439 --> 01:31:48,393
...or a week or a month,
if we're lucky.

873
01:31:49,067 --> 01:31:51,356
Sometimes they even pay the rent.

874
01:31:53,530 --> 01:31:55,357
They keep out all the rats.

875
01:31:56,241 --> 01:31:59,242
Not animal-type rats.
I'm talking about real rats...

876
01:31:59,411 --> 01:32:01,119
...the junkies and the winos...

877
01:32:01,288 --> 01:32:04,823
...and the shitheads
and the people who beat up...

878
01:32:08,671 --> 01:32:11,244
...little 5-year-old kids.

879
01:32:14,969 --> 01:32:17,008
I got three sisters, see?

880
01:32:18,764 --> 01:32:22,845
One of them, Maria, she's
in kind of a special place.

881
01:32:24,145 --> 01:32:28,190
We see her a couple times a year.
She's got a birth defect.

882
01:32:31,319 --> 01:32:34,106
That's a goddamn lie.

883
01:32:35,824 --> 01:32:38,493
That's a goddamn lie!

884
01:32:40,161 --> 01:32:42,913
Want to know about my father?
My first fucking father?

885
01:32:43,081 --> 01:32:45,240
He ain't no special shit.

886
01:32:46,585 --> 01:32:50,084
He's in New York State Penitentiary.
He's doing time.

887
01:32:51,381 --> 01:32:54,418
I remember this one night
he got bothered...

888
01:32:54,593 --> 01:32:58,092
...because I was making her laugh.
I was telling her stories.

889
01:32:58,555 --> 01:33:02,090
It was just kid stuff.
Flying carpets and dragons.

890
01:33:02,267 --> 01:33:05,352
And he got mad
because she was laughing!

891
01:33:05,938 --> 01:33:08,511
And he said I was telling her lies.

892
01:33:08,816 --> 01:33:10,393
And this one night...

893
01:33:11,694 --> 01:33:13,402
...he got bothered.

894
01:33:14,613 --> 01:33:17,021
He's beating me
and coming down on me...

895
01:33:17,199 --> 01:33:18,694
...I said, "I make her laugh. "

896
01:33:18,868 --> 01:33:22,035
That's not a lie, that's a gift,
goddamn it.

897
01:33:23,289 --> 01:33:25,412
He can't do it.

898
01:33:26,626 --> 01:33:30,920
He said if he can't do it,
he sure as shit's gonna stop it.

899
01:33:32,548 --> 01:33:34,956
And he went for me, and...

900
01:33:35,843 --> 01:33:38,798
...she got in the way
all of a sudden, and...

901
01:33:40,390 --> 01:33:43,095
...he put her head inside a fucking wall.

902
01:33:43,977 --> 01:33:47,262
If it was my fucking head,
it would've been all right...

903
01:33:47,439 --> 01:33:49,645
...but it wasn't. It was hers!

904
01:33:49,983 --> 01:33:54,147
If it was my fucking fat head,
it would've been all right.

905
01:33:55,822 --> 01:33:59,156
She's a beautiful kid.
She's 5 fucking years old.

906
01:33:59,409 --> 01:34:04,486
She's got a pretty little laugh.
She still laughs, as a matter of fact.

907
01:35:06,353 --> 01:35:08,511
Barbra Streisand didn't
change her name.

908
01:35:08,730 --> 01:35:12,396
- I don't want to talk about it.
- I'll call you Doris, like always.

909
01:35:12,568 --> 01:35:13,730
I won't answer.

910
01:35:13,902 --> 01:35:17,734
- It's a perfectly good name.
- For a perfectly good person.

911
01:35:17,906 --> 01:35:21,358
A skinny, boring, nondescript,
perfectly good person.

912
01:35:21,702 --> 01:35:27,076
I have a lot of friends named Doris,
and they are none of those things.

913
01:35:27,333 --> 01:35:29,491
- Yeah, but they're all-
- What?

914
01:35:29,752 --> 01:35:31,910
No, no, no. Say it. Go ahead. Say it!

915
01:35:32,088 --> 01:35:36,501
I would like to know what my daughter
thinks is wrong with my friends.

916
01:35:36,676 --> 01:35:40,211
I don't want a middle-aged name.
I can't relate to it.

917
01:35:40,513 --> 01:35:42,007
You can call me Dominique.

918
01:35:42,181 --> 01:35:43,344
Dominique.

919
01:35:43,516 --> 01:35:45,841
- That's ridiculous.
- It's French.

920
01:35:46,019 --> 01:35:50,479
- I know what it is, but it's not you.
- I'll grow into it.

921
01:35:50,774 --> 01:35:54,225
- Dominique Finsecker?
- No. Dominique Dupont.

922
01:35:54,819 --> 01:35:56,942
- Sounds like a hooker.
- Oh, Mama.

923
01:35:57,113 --> 01:36:01,028
I don't know what's happening to you.
Tell me what's happening to you.

924
01:36:01,451 --> 01:36:03,610
Where did my Doris go?

925
01:36:03,954 --> 01:36:07,952
Something wonderful is happening
to me, Mama. I'm growing up.

926
01:36:09,167 --> 01:36:11,374
You're becoming somebody else.

927
01:36:11,670 --> 01:36:16,083
- I'm becoming an actress.
- I want you to be the Doris that I know.

928
01:36:16,258 --> 01:36:19,212
That I love. That helps
me with the groceries.

929
01:36:20,179 --> 01:36:22,218
Makes me birthday cards...

930
01:36:22,389 --> 01:36:24,797
...out of Cheerio packets, huh?

931
01:36:25,434 --> 01:36:26,893
Not Dominique...

932
01:36:27,228 --> 01:36:29,267
...who stays out all night.

933
01:36:29,438 --> 01:36:30,814
Oh, Mama.

934
01:36:31,023 --> 01:36:32,815
And gets pregnant.

935
01:36:33,317 --> 01:36:35,689
Or has an abortion, God forbid.

936
01:36:37,488 --> 01:36:40,691
Now, Dominique, she'd be smart.

937
01:36:41,617 --> 01:36:43,325
But my Doris...

938
01:36:43,870 --> 01:36:45,909
...she's dumb enough
to get knocked up-

939
01:36:46,289 --> 01:36:48,578
Mama, it was just one night!

940
01:36:50,501 --> 01:36:52,126
That's all it takes.

941
01:37:03,556 --> 01:37:06,926
We'd like to welcome everyone to
The Rocky Horror Picture Show...

942
01:37:07,102 --> 01:37:09,509
...here at the 8th Street Playhouse!

943
01:37:14,693 --> 01:37:17,694
And our regulars would
like to wish a warm welcome...

944
01:37:17,863 --> 01:37:20,354
...to all you virgins!

945
01:37:24,078 --> 01:37:26,829
We have some special occasions tonight.

946
01:37:27,206 --> 01:37:29,779
Tonight is Gail's birthday.

947
01:37:34,046 --> 01:37:38,044
We have a special button
for a special young lady.

948
01:37:38,217 --> 01:37:42,429
Tonight is Christine's 150th time!

949
01:37:53,358 --> 01:37:55,397
Let's hear it for her! Come on!

950
01:38:02,075 --> 01:38:05,159
Now, we have a special warning
from the management.

951
01:38:05,328 --> 01:38:08,365
No lit candles. No throwing
food at the screen. Understand?

952
01:38:08,623 --> 01:38:09,904
Get on with the show!

953
01:38:10,458 --> 01:38:13,080
This is the fucking show!
If you don't like it...

954
01:38:13,253 --> 01:38:15,578
...you can go see the movie
in Staten Island!

955
01:38:15,756 --> 01:38:18,922
Boy, is he in for a surprise tonight.

956
01:38:19,301 --> 01:38:20,961
All right, for the cheers!

957
01:38:21,136 --> 01:38:22,879
- Give me an R!
- R!

958
01:38:23,138 --> 01:38:24,680
- Give me an O!
- O!

959
01:38:24,890 --> 01:38:26,265
- Give me a C!
- C!

960
01:38:26,433 --> 01:38:28,307
- Give me a K!
- K!

961
01:38:28,477 --> 01:38:29,852
- Give me a Y!
- Y!

962
01:38:30,104 --> 01:38:31,728
- What's it spell?
- Rocky!

963
01:38:31,897 --> 01:38:34,103
- I can't hear you!
- Rocky!

964
01:38:34,358 --> 01:38:36,434
- One more time!
- Rocky!

965
01:38:36,610 --> 01:38:37,725
- Give me an E!
- E!

966
01:38:37,903 --> 01:38:39,445
- Give me an A!
- A!

967
01:38:39,613 --> 01:38:42,365
- What kind of time we gonna have?
- E-A!

968
01:40:55,169 --> 01:40:57,411
Where did that
motorcyclist come from?

969
01:40:57,588 --> 01:40:59,332
I guess we'll have to turn back.

970
01:41:05,888 --> 01:41:08,759
- What was that bang?
- Must have a blowout.

971
01:41:09,350 --> 01:41:10,679
Damn it!

972
01:41:10,852 --> 01:41:14,932
- I should have gotten that spare fixed.
- Asshole!

973
01:41:15,106 --> 01:41:17,348
Stay here and keep warm.
I'll go for help.

974
01:41:17,525 --> 01:41:19,933
Where will you go
in the middle of nowhere?

975
01:41:20,111 --> 01:41:23,611
What's white and sells hamburgers?

976
01:41:23,782 --> 01:41:26,783
Didn't we pass a castle down the road?

977
01:41:27,077 --> 01:41:29,153
Maybe they have a telephone.

978
01:41:29,329 --> 01:41:30,954
I'm going with you.

979
01:41:35,460 --> 01:41:37,702
Kick it!

980
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:46,628
Hey, Janet! How about fries
to go with that shake?

981
01:41:50,851 --> 01:41:53,389
Take the risk!

982
01:42:00,319 --> 01:42:03,984
Hey, Riff, show us your mother!

983
01:42:22,008 --> 01:42:23,799
Watch the film.

984
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,242
How's it go?

985
01:43:13,936 --> 01:43:16,095
Oh, my God.

986
01:43:25,823 --> 01:43:27,816
- You did what?
- I got stoned.

987
01:43:28,535 --> 01:43:30,907
She took her top off.
She played with her bongos.

988
01:43:31,371 --> 01:43:33,410
- I did not!
- It was incredible!

989
01:43:33,581 --> 01:43:35,621
It was more than incredible, it was fun.

990
01:43:35,792 --> 01:43:39,541
I felt naked when people looked at me
before. But they weren't looking at me...

991
01:43:39,713 --> 01:43:42,833
...they were looking at someone
I put on. Like a costume.

992
01:43:43,216 --> 01:43:47,760
If I don't have a personality, so what?
I'm an actress.

993
01:43:47,971 --> 01:43:50,593
I can put on
as many personalities as I want.

994
01:43:50,766 --> 01:43:53,517
- To schizophrenia!
- Abso-fucking-lutely!

995
01:43:53,894 --> 01:43:57,643
- Abso-fucking-what?
- You kids ready to order now?

996
01:43:58,273 --> 01:44:00,065
- Michael?
- Yeah.

997
01:44:00,609 --> 01:44:02,317
You don't remember?

998
01:44:02,945 --> 01:44:05,103
Two years ago. I'm Doris Fin-

999
01:44:05,281 --> 01:44:08,946
I was Doris Finsecker, when
you were a senior at P.A.

1000
01:44:09,493 --> 01:44:13,491
- Yeah. Around the corner.
- You remember Montgomery MacNeil...

1001
01:44:13,664 --> 01:44:15,953
- ... and Ralph Garci.
- Sure. Good old days.

1002
01:44:16,542 --> 01:44:17,573
How was Hollywood?

1003
01:44:18,044 --> 01:44:19,206
Slow.

1004
01:44:19,462 --> 01:44:22,297
I met some people,
went to some parties.

1005
01:44:22,715 --> 01:44:26,131
- I did a pilot for a series.
- I didn't see it.

1006
01:44:26,344 --> 01:44:27,803
Nobody saw it.

1007
01:44:28,179 --> 01:44:29,294
Sorry.

1008
01:44:29,973 --> 01:44:33,306
- I did a couple of days as a male nurse.
- Did you?

1009
01:44:33,643 --> 01:44:35,517
On a soap.

1010
01:44:36,479 --> 01:44:39,149
- I didn't like L.A. too much.
- It sucks out there.

1011
01:44:39,524 --> 01:44:43,059
- Are you studying?
- I catch a class when I can.

1012
01:44:43,236 --> 01:44:44,944
Hard times, you know?

1013
01:44:45,822 --> 01:44:48,360
- I read for a showcase.
- Oh, really?

1014
01:44:48,533 --> 01:44:50,490
I got a callback next week.

1015
01:44:50,827 --> 01:44:52,654
- Hope you get it.
- Hey, good luck.

1016
01:44:53,038 --> 01:44:54,117
Yeah.

1017
01:44:54,706 --> 01:44:55,821
Yeah.

1018
01:44:57,668 --> 01:44:59,043
What you kids having?

1019
01:44:59,336 --> 01:45:01,625
Got a special today on fried clams.

1020
01:45:01,922 --> 01:45:05,172
- Fried clams sound great.
- Yeah, that's fine.

1021
01:45:06,093 --> 01:45:09,925
- Fried clams is great.
- Yeah, sounds good.

1022
01:45:14,185 --> 01:45:16,261
Welcome to Catch a Rising Star.

1023
01:45:17,605 --> 01:45:20,012
Did anybody know it was Monday night?

1024
01:45:20,316 --> 01:45:24,065
Monday night is audition night.
Anybody from anywhere...

1025
01:45:24,237 --> 01:45:26,395
...can come up here and do
what they want.

1026
01:45:26,572 --> 01:45:29,110
You should see what walks in the room.

1027
01:45:29,283 --> 01:45:32,534
Some of the people that started here
were David Brenner...

1028
01:45:32,704 --> 01:45:33,902
...Jimmie Walker...

1029
01:45:34,122 --> 01:45:38,583
...Gabe Kaplan, Freddie Prinze.
Maybe this next young man might...

1030
01:45:39,002 --> 01:45:40,710
...watch them on television.

1031
01:45:41,379 --> 01:45:44,914
Please welcome the comedy stylings...

1032
01:45:45,175 --> 01:45:48,176
...of Ralph Garci, ladies and gentlemen.

1033
01:45:53,016 --> 01:45:55,175
Yay, Ralph!

1034
01:45:56,019 --> 01:45:57,050
Thank you.

1035
01:45:57,813 --> 01:46:00,730
Like Richard said,
my name is Ralph Garci.

1036
01:46:00,899 --> 01:46:02,773
I'm a professional asshole.

1037
01:46:06,113 --> 01:46:09,564
I see we have a few
amateurs in the audience.

1038
01:46:11,243 --> 01:46:12,358
I have some-

1039
01:46:12,536 --> 01:46:17,245
Some. I have all of my friends here
tonight. From P.A. graduating class.

1040
01:46:21,712 --> 01:46:24,203
It's very important to have friends.

1041
01:46:25,007 --> 01:46:26,751
I live in the South Bronx.

1042
01:46:28,511 --> 01:46:32,094
That's the country just north of Harlem
and west of Puerto Rico.

1043
01:46:32,265 --> 01:46:34,388
It's a very tough neighborhood.

1044
01:46:34,559 --> 01:46:36,219
The dogs carry knives.

1045
01:46:38,271 --> 01:46:41,106
Did you ever see a baby
with a zip gun?

1046
01:46:41,816 --> 01:46:46,277
You gotta have friends. You can't
alienate anybody up there. Nobody.

1047
01:46:46,446 --> 01:46:50,111
Black people, white people, Chicanos,
Puerto Ricans, cockroaches.

1048
01:46:50,700 --> 01:46:53,535
You gotta respect cockroaches.
They got a good union.

1049
01:46:53,912 --> 01:46:58,289
Last week, 15,000 marched down my
block demanding better housing.

1050
01:47:00,460 --> 01:47:04,292
But I love the South Bronx.
Everywhere you go from there is up.

1051
01:47:05,340 --> 01:47:10,168
Everybody has dreams in the
South Bronx. I had dreams.

1052
01:47:10,554 --> 01:47:14,053
Stop your average boy
on a South Bronx street...

1053
01:47:14,850 --> 01:47:17,258
...and ask him
what he wants to be.

1054
01:47:17,645 --> 01:47:20,764
"I want to be an ex-junkie, man. "

1055
01:47:21,857 --> 01:47:23,731
You can see them every day.

1056
01:47:23,901 --> 01:47:28,230
You can't drive because of the dreams
on the streets being seen by cokeheads.

1057
01:47:28,406 --> 01:47:33,447
The minute that white line's laid down
the street, you got somebody going:

1058
01:47:34,662 --> 01:47:35,777
It's true.

1059
01:47:37,331 --> 01:47:40,001
And then there is sex.

1060
01:47:41,169 --> 01:47:42,579
Oh, yeah.

1061
01:47:42,962 --> 01:47:45,667
Kids are into sex earlier in South Bronx.

1062
01:47:46,674 --> 01:47:48,334
Like about 6 a. m.

1063
01:47:52,764 --> 01:47:54,388
- You were wonderful.
- No.

1064
01:47:54,557 --> 01:47:57,511
- Really.
- I was good. I felt more than good.

1065
01:47:57,686 --> 01:47:59,762
- The guy wants me back.
- You're kidding!

1066
01:47:59,938 --> 01:48:01,646
He wants to book me regularly.

1067
01:48:01,815 --> 01:48:03,226
- Great!
- That's not great...

1068
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:05,558
...it's fantastic! It's like electricity.

1069
01:48:05,735 --> 01:48:09,318
You're out there. Those faces are
out there, staring at you...

1070
01:48:09,489 --> 01:48:12,905
...and you draw them in, then
you hit them with the juice.

1071
01:48:13,076 --> 01:48:17,288
And bam! They fucking explode!
And that power goes back and forth.

1072
01:48:17,456 --> 01:48:19,947
Next thing you know,
you're making them laugh.

1073
01:48:20,125 --> 01:48:23,744
That is the meanest high there is.
That beats dope. That beats sex.

1074
01:48:24,171 --> 01:48:27,421
I love fucking acting!

1075
01:48:27,633 --> 01:48:31,132
With my money, we can get
a place. We can get married maybe.

1076
01:48:31,303 --> 01:48:35,550
I'll have $20,000 a week, a hit
TV series, my face on TV Guide!

1077
01:48:35,725 --> 01:48:36,839
- Wait!
- What?

1078
01:48:37,018 --> 01:48:40,766
- What about me? Don't I get a career?
- A career? I'll give you a career.

1079
01:48:40,980 --> 01:48:46,140
How about Shakespeare in the Park
and you get to win 17 Tony awards?

1080
01:48:46,402 --> 01:48:49,320
- All right. Bye.
- All right. Okay. Bye.

1081
01:48:51,074 --> 01:48:52,734
Don't mug anybody.

1082
01:48:53,201 --> 01:48:56,237
- Don't rape anybody.
- I'll rape you.

1083
01:48:56,412 --> 01:48:57,788
Don't rape anybody, okay?

1084
01:48:57,956 --> 01:48:59,580
I'll see you later. Take care.

1085
01:49:04,754 --> 01:49:05,999
You see...

1086
01:49:07,215 --> 01:49:10,584
...I've been offered this place
with the San Francisco Ballet.

1087
01:49:10,761 --> 01:49:13,845
I haven't told anyone yet,
but I'm gonna take it.

1088
01:49:14,014 --> 01:49:16,137
I don't care what they think.

1089
01:49:16,725 --> 01:49:19,133
I'm a good dancer. Better than good.

1090
01:49:19,394 --> 01:49:21,850
Maybe even the best in the school.

1091
01:49:22,731 --> 01:49:26,147
That's not conceit.
It's just simple honesty.

1092
01:49:27,319 --> 01:49:31,862
If I stay in New York, everybody will
think I bought my way into ABT.

1093
01:49:32,157 --> 01:49:37,282
I'm not starving myself to death
for Balanchine's City Ballet.

1094
01:49:38,456 --> 01:49:41,872
Not that I mind doing
the corps de ballet bullshit.

1095
01:49:42,460 --> 01:49:44,951
I'd sooner do it out of town.

1096
01:49:46,589 --> 01:49:49,162
I'll pay my dues on the West Coast.

1097
01:49:50,009 --> 01:49:52,796
Come back to New York as a star.

1098
01:49:55,598 --> 01:49:56,796
You see...

1099
01:49:57,642 --> 01:50:00,215
...I've always had this crazy dream...

1100
01:50:00,395 --> 01:50:04,143
...of dancing all the classical
roles before I'm 21.

1101
01:50:05,817 --> 01:50:09,815
I want Giselles and Coppélias
coming out of my feet.

1102
01:50:10,363 --> 01:50:12,403
And Sleeping Beauties...

1103
01:50:12,866 --> 01:50:14,859
...and the Swan.

1104
01:50:16,495 --> 01:50:19,531
I want bravos in Stuttgart
and Leningrad...

1105
01:50:19,706 --> 01:50:21,284
...and Paris.

1106
01:50:22,542 --> 01:50:25,994
Maybe even a ballet
created especially for me.

1107
01:50:29,341 --> 01:50:30,835
You see...

1108
01:50:31,510 --> 01:50:34,345
...there's no room for a baby.

1109
01:50:35,306 --> 01:50:38,840
Will this be Master Charge
or American Express, honey?

1110
01:50:47,652 --> 01:50:48,932
Excuse me.

1111
01:50:50,196 --> 01:50:51,939
You're an actress, aren't you?

1112
01:50:52,323 --> 01:50:53,698
I might be.

1113
01:50:54,534 --> 01:50:56,360
A Chorus Line, right?

1114
01:50:56,786 --> 01:51:00,487
Aren't you the one that does that
hot, smoky number in the red dress?

1115
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:03,827
I'm right, ain't I? I knew it.

1116
01:51:04,377 --> 01:51:08,291
Boy, let me tell you, you are
the best thing in that show.

1117
01:51:09,924 --> 01:51:13,673
I guess you get tired of hearing that.
Excuse me.

1118
01:51:13,845 --> 01:51:15,387
No, I don't.

1119
01:51:16,890 --> 01:51:18,681
You don't belong there.

1120
01:51:19,017 --> 01:51:21,389
If you don't mind my
saying so, you're a star.

1121
01:51:21,561 --> 01:51:23,353
You need a show all to yourself.

1122
01:51:23,563 --> 01:51:27,893
- You've got a lovely face, a great figure.
- I sing too.

1123
01:51:28,068 --> 01:51:29,562
- No.
- And play the piano.

1124
01:51:29,861 --> 01:51:32,613
That's what I mean. But it's
more than just talent...

1125
01:51:32,781 --> 01:51:34,857
...it's a certain quality.

1126
01:51:35,075 --> 01:51:38,029
You're the kind of girl that
stands out in a room.

1127
01:51:38,245 --> 01:51:41,282
This might sound a little
presumptuous of me...

1128
01:51:42,124 --> 01:51:44,200
I should probably
just call your agent.

1129
01:51:44,835 --> 01:51:49,129
- I don't really relate to agents.
- Don't blame you at all.

1130
01:51:49,381 --> 01:51:52,751
Listen, my name is François.
Francois Lafete.

1131
01:51:53,135 --> 01:51:54,167
Coco.

1132
01:51:54,553 --> 01:51:57,804
Coco? Coco? That's terrific!

1133
01:51:58,099 --> 01:52:02,179
Listen, Coco, I'm doing this picture
down in the south of France, you know?

1134
01:52:02,895 --> 01:52:05,433
I was wondering if...

1135
01:52:06,274 --> 01:52:08,847
...maybe you'd like to do
a screen test for me.

1136
01:52:12,739 --> 01:52:14,198
Are you serious?

1137
01:52:20,789 --> 01:52:22,283
Bunsky.

1138
01:52:22,749 --> 01:52:24,160
Hey, Bunsky.

1139
01:52:25,252 --> 01:52:26,331
You seen Sherwood?

1140
01:52:26,545 --> 01:52:28,668
She's with her husband.

1141
01:52:28,839 --> 01:52:31,543
- I didn't know she had a husband.
- He's sick, Leroy.

1142
01:52:31,925 --> 01:52:33,717
He'd have to be to be her husband.

1143
01:52:33,885 --> 01:52:36,590
He's quite bad.
In the hospital, anyway.

1144
01:52:36,763 --> 01:52:38,637
- Hospital?
- Apparently.

1145
01:52:39,183 --> 01:52:40,843
Okay, Schlepstein.

1146
01:53:08,629 --> 01:53:10,752
Leroy. What are you doing here?

1147
01:53:14,093 --> 01:53:15,837
You ever heard of Alvin Ailey?

1148
01:53:16,054 --> 01:53:17,334
Alvin Ailey?

1149
01:53:17,847 --> 01:53:18,962
He's a...

1150
01:53:19,599 --> 01:53:21,093
He's a choreographer?

1151
01:53:22,268 --> 01:53:24,178
He wants me to join his company.

1152
01:53:24,354 --> 01:53:27,853
I'm sorry, Leroy, but I don't think
this is the time-

1153
01:53:28,024 --> 01:53:30,776
I can't if you flunk me out.
I have to pass.

1154
01:53:31,027 --> 01:53:33,269
You should've thought of it
four years ago.

1155
01:53:33,447 --> 01:53:35,854
Where I come from
it don't pay to read and speak white.

1156
01:53:36,033 --> 01:53:37,906
Don't lecture me, Leroy.

1157
01:53:38,493 --> 01:53:42,408
Maybe I didn't say it right, but you
been down hard on me since day one.

1158
01:53:42,581 --> 01:53:44,823
Whatever you say,
Leroy. Go home.

1159
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:48,203
I stopped going home!
You never knew that, did you?

1160
01:53:48,379 --> 01:53:52,756
You make a big deal about pulling us out
of the gutter, yet you won't eat with us.

1161
01:53:52,925 --> 01:53:55,594
You know where that leaves people
like me? Nowhere!

1162
01:53:55,761 --> 01:53:59,925
- It isn't the time. I don't wanna hear it.
- You're going to hear it!

1163
01:54:00,099 --> 01:54:04,013
- I'm gonna be a good dancer!
- Just get out of here, please!

1164
01:54:04,270 --> 01:54:07,306
- You will not keep me down...
- Leave me alone!

1165
01:54:07,481 --> 01:54:12,559
- ... because I can't read stories!
- Don't you think of anyone but yourself?

1166
01:54:32,591 --> 01:54:33,622
Hey.

1167
01:54:34,301 --> 01:54:36,210
How's your old man doing?

1168
01:54:36,845 --> 01:54:37,876
Shit.

1169
01:54:42,476 --> 01:54:43,507
Here.

1170
01:54:45,437 --> 01:54:47,015
Thank you.

1171
01:55:49,419 --> 01:55:53,797
Coco. Bonjour. You made it. Come on in.

1172
01:55:57,136 --> 01:56:00,172
- Am I early?
- Don't be silly. Let me take your coat.

1173
01:56:00,681 --> 01:56:02,839
- Where's the crew?
- You're looking at him.

1174
01:56:03,058 --> 01:56:06,225
I must have total control of
the creative product.

1175
01:56:06,395 --> 01:56:07,806
Like Godard.

1176
01:56:08,647 --> 01:56:11,851
- Jean-Luc Godard? Ever hear of that guy?
- French?

1177
01:56:14,403 --> 01:56:16,811
- You ever see any of his pictures?
- Sure.

1178
01:56:16,989 --> 01:56:18,982
Then you know what I'm talking about.

1179
01:56:20,034 --> 01:56:24,495
You see, I belong, sort of, to the
auteur school of filmmaking.

1180
01:56:24,664 --> 01:56:26,206
It's like the-

1181
01:56:26,374 --> 01:56:29,743
It's like the Mediterranean
approach, you know what I mean?

1182
01:56:31,087 --> 01:56:33,495
- Do you want a beer?
- No, thanks. I'm okay.

1183
01:56:33,673 --> 01:56:37,338
- It might relax you.
- It's all right. I have a lot on my mind.

1184
01:56:37,510 --> 01:56:38,839
I understand.

1185
01:56:40,764 --> 01:56:42,590
- What?
- Come here.

1186
01:56:43,975 --> 01:56:47,344
That's it. I want you to sit right here.

1187
01:56:47,521 --> 01:56:52,479
We're gonna do a lovely close-up
of that beautiful face.

1188
01:56:53,485 --> 01:56:56,854
I get nervous at first with cold readings,
but then I'm all right.

1189
01:56:57,030 --> 01:57:00,197
Don't worry about that.
We'll get to the dialogue later.

1190
01:57:00,993 --> 01:57:05,702
- So, you like art movies, huh, Coco?
- Antonioni and those people? Sure.

1191
01:57:05,873 --> 01:57:08,280
It beats watching Laverne & Shirley.

1192
01:57:08,459 --> 01:57:11,744
Coco, you don't know
what you're doing to my lens.

1193
01:57:14,215 --> 01:57:16,503
You have a natural rapport
with the camera.

1194
01:57:16,675 --> 01:57:19,961
It's unbelievable. Some performers
can make love to the camera.

1195
01:57:20,137 --> 01:57:21,548
Garbo did.

1196
01:57:21,973 --> 01:57:23,550
Monroe did.

1197
01:57:24,934 --> 01:57:26,132
So could you.

1198
01:57:26,519 --> 01:57:28,558
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

1199
01:57:28,980 --> 01:57:31,138
Could you take your top off, please?

1200
01:57:34,902 --> 01:57:38,022
- What?
- Could you take your blouse off?

1201
01:57:39,866 --> 01:57:42,155
- Are you kidding?
- No, I'm not kidding.

1202
01:57:43,286 --> 01:57:46,204
What's the matter?
You're acting like some dumb kid.

1203
01:57:46,373 --> 01:57:48,780
- I thought you were a professional.
- I am.

1204
01:57:48,959 --> 01:57:50,916
Well, then what's the problem?

1205
01:58:03,432 --> 01:58:05,223
I can't.

1206
01:58:15,319 --> 01:58:16,599
That's better.

1207
01:58:18,155 --> 01:58:19,614
That's lovely.

1208
01:58:21,450 --> 01:58:23,110
Oh, yeah.

1209
01:58:24,954 --> 01:58:29,034
Yeah. Could you arch your back?
Arch your back a little, Coco.

1210
01:58:32,628 --> 01:58:34,835
Smile for me, Coco.

1211
01:58:35,173 --> 01:58:40,084
Come on, Coco. Smile, smile.
Smile for me.

1212
01:58:41,262 --> 01:58:43,054
Now take your thumb...

1213
01:58:43,223 --> 01:58:44,931
...and put it in your mouth...

1214
01:58:45,099 --> 01:58:47,637
...like a little schoolgirl.

1215
01:58:50,230 --> 01:58:52,472
You ever notice that
black news reporters...

1216
01:58:52,649 --> 01:58:55,484
...get hired because
they have white accents?

1217
01:58:55,652 --> 01:58:59,021
They should hire a more natural guy,
a dude from the street.

1218
01:58:59,447 --> 01:59:01,025
"This is Rufus X with the news... "

1219
01:59:03,452 --> 01:59:04,994
I need something.

1220
01:59:05,162 --> 01:59:06,490
Sleep.

1221
01:59:07,205 --> 01:59:09,779
- Something to keep me flying.
- Like what?

1222
01:59:10,209 --> 01:59:12,996
Like by way of your witch doctor.

1223
01:59:13,295 --> 01:59:15,667
I don't see Dr. Golden anymore.
You know that.

1224
01:59:16,173 --> 01:59:18,047
Anyway, you've been taking too much.

1225
01:59:18,217 --> 01:59:21,004
- Thanks, Marcus Welby.
- I know what I'm talking about.

1226
01:59:21,178 --> 01:59:23,550
Why don't you get off my fucking case?

1227
01:59:23,722 --> 01:59:26,510
- I'm your friend.
- You're my friend? Really?

1228
01:59:26,684 --> 01:59:30,349
I know what you've been
after, you goddamn faggot.

1229
01:59:34,525 --> 01:59:36,399
I gotta go to the bathroom.

1230
01:59:38,196 --> 01:59:39,904
Good. You do that.

1231
01:59:41,866 --> 01:59:43,408
Hi. You got a problem?

1232
01:59:44,035 --> 01:59:45,363
Yeah, I do.

1233
01:59:45,828 --> 01:59:47,655
We never see you anymore.

1234
01:59:47,914 --> 01:59:49,373
You see me plenty.

1235
01:59:49,541 --> 01:59:52,032
Drinking with your new friends
after the show.

1236
01:59:52,210 --> 01:59:55,460
After the show is when
all the big names come in.

1237
01:59:55,630 --> 01:59:57,837
You meet people. That's what counts.

1238
01:59:58,008 --> 02:00:00,878
I hate drinking. I'm doing this
for my future. For our future.

1239
02:00:01,052 --> 02:00:04,303
You're doing this for some image,
for Freddie because he did it.

1240
02:00:04,473 --> 02:00:06,880
- Yeah? Maybe.
- Yeah? Well, he died doing it.

1241
02:00:07,184 --> 02:00:09,342
- He could have been a real actor.
- He was!

1242
02:00:09,519 --> 02:00:13,268
He was funny and charming
and he made people laugh. That's it.

1243
02:00:13,440 --> 02:00:16,891
- That's plenty!
- That's not enough! Not for you!

1244
02:00:17,069 --> 02:00:18,896
- Jesus Christ!
- You are good, Ralph.

1245
02:00:19,071 --> 02:00:21,562
- You're seriously really good.
- Jesus.

1246
02:00:21,740 --> 02:00:26,568
You're full of rage and pain and love.
Not just jokes. You're an original.

1247
02:00:26,745 --> 02:00:28,655
The original Ralph Garci.

1248
02:00:28,914 --> 02:00:32,579
- You don't have to be somebody else.
- You're bringing me down!

1249
02:00:32,752 --> 02:00:35,373
- You're bringing me fucking down!
- I'm sorry!

1250
02:00:35,546 --> 02:00:39,591
I gotta go make people laugh, and
you're talking about rage and pain.

1251
02:00:39,759 --> 02:00:42,297
- I said I'm sorry!
- It takes fucking wings.

1252
02:00:42,470 --> 02:00:45,755
Miss Seriously, let me tear flypaper, huh?

1253
02:00:46,265 --> 02:00:48,223
Give me a fucking break, honey!

1254
02:00:48,393 --> 02:00:52,058
Give me a fucking break.
Okay, pal? Thank you.

1255
02:00:55,066 --> 02:00:58,934
- What's happening to you?
- What's happening to me? Success.

1256
02:00:59,112 --> 02:01:03,157
Now, you either hang on or hang up.
All right?

1257
02:01:08,788 --> 02:01:12,573
It's a great pleasure to introduce
a young man who's funny and loud.

1258
02:01:12,751 --> 02:01:14,079
Especially during my act.

1259
02:01:14,252 --> 02:01:18,202
Please welcome the comedy stylings
of Ralph Garci, ladies and gentlemen.

1260
02:01:20,717 --> 02:01:25,960
That's right. My name is Ralph Garci,
and I'm a professional asshole.

1261
02:01:29,977 --> 02:01:35,184
That's right. I see we have a couple
of amateurs in the audience tonight.

1262
02:01:35,649 --> 02:01:37,274
Don't we?

1263
02:01:38,652 --> 02:01:41,404
I see. How about sign language?

1264
02:01:41,572 --> 02:01:45,155
We have a standing ovation
over there.

1265
02:01:45,534 --> 02:01:48,820
That's great. Hon, where you from?

1266
02:01:49,747 --> 02:01:54,125
Okey-dokey. That's my best friend.

1267
02:01:55,670 --> 02:01:57,544
Yeah, friends are important.

1268
02:01:59,007 --> 02:02:03,170
I live in the South Bronx, and up there,
you got the Harlems of-

1269
02:02:03,470 --> 02:02:07,337
Shit! I'm sorry.
Excuse me. Fuck it.

1270
02:02:07,807 --> 02:02:09,350
That was supposed to be...

1271
02:02:09,851 --> 02:02:13,931
The north- The countries north
of Harlem and west of Puerto Rico.

1272
02:02:14,356 --> 02:02:17,061
That's what it was supposed to be.
Yes, indeed it was.

1273
02:02:17,234 --> 02:02:19,310
Anyway, there's lots of things there:

1274
02:02:19,486 --> 02:02:23,353
Rats, cockroaches,
and, you know, little bugs.

1275
02:02:23,532 --> 02:02:27,197
You know what cockroaches are?
Little things that crawl in the night.

1276
02:02:29,204 --> 02:02:33,831
Listen, I don't mean to alarm you,
but if you don't laugh, you'll get cancer.

1277
02:02:36,003 --> 02:02:40,167
Sorry. That was probably in bad taste,
and I didn't really...

1278
02:02:44,428 --> 02:02:48,675
Excuse me. Fuck it.
Thank you very much.

1279
02:03:09,913 --> 02:03:11,027
What do you want?

1280
02:03:11,748 --> 02:03:13,906
Pizza sounds good.
You wanna eat?

1281
02:03:14,668 --> 02:03:17,503
Could you give me a break, all right?

1282
02:03:17,963 --> 02:03:20,917
We could split a special,
with anchovies, maybe.

1283
02:03:21,216 --> 02:03:26,459
Fuck anchovies. I died out there,
you're talking about fucking pizzas?

1284
02:03:26,638 --> 02:03:32,225
- No, I'm talking about eating pizzas.
- Oh, that's very funny. You're a howl.

1285
02:03:32,394 --> 02:03:35,478
You should have been out there.
The audience hated me.

1286
02:03:35,647 --> 02:03:39,977
- You had a bad night. That happens.
- Not to me, it doesn't.

1287
02:03:40,152 --> 02:03:43,438
What do you want? Insurance?
You're in the wrong business.

1288
02:03:43,614 --> 02:03:46,531
Performers aren't safe.
We're pie-in-the-face people.

1289
02:03:46,700 --> 02:03:50,034
Look, don't lecture me.
All right, Sir Laurence?

1290
02:03:50,204 --> 02:03:54,118
All anyone ever promised you was
seven classes a day and a hot lunch.

1291
02:03:54,625 --> 02:03:56,084
The rest is up to you.

1292
02:03:56,252 --> 02:04:00,795
Back in the Middle Ages, actors,
they didn't even want to bury us.

1293
02:04:01,799 --> 02:04:03,543
Well, they do now.

1294
02:04:04,302 --> 02:04:06,923
Not if you're good.

1295
02:04:08,681 --> 02:04:10,425
How do you know?

1296
02:04:11,392 --> 02:04:14,144
How do you know if you're good?

1297
02:04:14,312 --> 02:04:16,435
Maybe you never know.

1298
02:04:21,820 --> 02:04:25,271
You just hang in, I guess.

1299
02:04:29,661 --> 02:04:31,570
You know the weirdest thing...

1300
02:04:32,414 --> 02:04:34,241
...is Freddie.

1301
02:04:35,125 --> 02:04:39,337
When he made it, he realized
it was everything he hated.

1302
02:04:39,880 --> 02:04:41,956
Cadillac Eldorado.

1303
02:04:42,132 --> 02:04:44,208
Pocketful of Quaaludes.

1304
02:04:44,385 --> 02:04:45,843
Johnny Carson.

1305
02:04:46,011 --> 02:04:48,170
It was no special shit.

1306
02:04:48,472 --> 02:04:50,678
You're not Freddie, Ralph.

1307
02:04:50,850 --> 02:04:53,341
I know that. I know.

1308
02:04:54,687 --> 02:04:59,016
Know something else about Freddie?
Freddie didn't even want to be Freddie.

1309
02:04:59,191 --> 02:05:03,355
- No?
- No. He wanted to be Joe Namath.

1310
02:05:05,698 --> 02:05:06,943
You laughed.

1311
02:05:07,116 --> 02:05:09,786
- Guess I'm funny.
- Let's get out of here.

1312
02:05:22,340 --> 02:05:23,538
5'7"?

1313
02:05:30,473 --> 02:05:33,095
Okay, you're finished.
Stand over there.

1314
02:05:33,268 --> 02:05:35,889
Go on. Keep the line moving.
Come on.

1315
02:05:36,305 --> 02:05:42,214
