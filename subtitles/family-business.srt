3
00:02:44,976 --> 00:02:47,659
24 dollars for a cab ride to the Bronx.
I can't believe it.

4
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:51,352
Come to my parents' for Passover
once a year without complaining, Vito.

5
00:02:59,584 --> 00:03:01,327
Wait a minute, honey, let me help you.

6
00:03:02,242 --> 00:03:04,616
- Will Adam be here?
- I don't know...

7
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:07,119
But if he is, be nice.
It's a Seder, okay?

8
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,461
Don't worry, don't worry.

9
00:03:11,545 --> 00:03:13,604
- Hi, Mom.
- Hello, darling.

10
00:03:13,805 --> 00:03:16,133
- Adam. Hi, darling.
- Hi.

11
00:03:16,187 --> 00:03:17,882
Come a little late like always.

12
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,641
Papa, hello, darling.

13
00:03:21,448 --> 00:03:24,383
Traffic. There are so many Jews
headed for Seder, Mama.

14
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:26,298
- Good day, sir.
- Hiya, Nat.

15
00:03:26,565 --> 00:03:28,692
I thought people were
cutting down on meat.

16
00:03:28,749 --> 00:03:31,479
How come the material
gets more expensive every year?

17
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,313
Please, don't worry yourself.

18
00:03:33,657 --> 00:03:36,648
I know the face, now.
The face... The face looks familiar.

19
00:03:36,697 --> 00:03:39,891
- Hey, Pop.
- Adam, how are you?

20
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:43,587
Hey, who'd you get this year?
I got Bernard Karlinski.

21
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:45,240
Let me see here.

22
00:03:46,232 --> 00:03:48,678
"The bar mitzvah of Owen Zuckerbrot."

23
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,587
Nat, Owen Zuckerbrot?

24
00:03:50,622 --> 00:03:53,400
He brings the yarmulkes home
from shul. You know, the extras.

25
00:03:53,462 --> 00:03:56,696
You want it to say
"Vito McMullen," you have to convert.

26
00:03:56,717 --> 00:03:57,420
Why not?

27
00:03:57,969 --> 00:03:58,810
Not yet.

28
00:04:19,787 --> 00:04:24,690
Did you see how Adam remembers
his Hebrew? With a mind like that.

29
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:26,481
- Ma.
- What did I say?

30
00:04:26,511 --> 00:04:29,002
It's a shande to me that
a boy with such a head...

31
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:32,691
Drops out of school six months
before a master's degree.

32
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,495
- Drops out? Drops out of school?
- Six months before.

33
00:04:35,496 --> 00:04:37,276
- Three months.
- Can we drop it?

34
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,988
We're not allowed to ask? You're back
since January. I haven't seen you.

35
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,953
- I came here for a Seder.
- Adam looks marvelous.

36
00:04:43,954 --> 00:04:45,777
- We're glad you're here.
- He's become a man.

37
00:04:45,778 --> 00:04:49,156
- Look how beautifully he eats.
- Ma, please. He's gonna be 23 years old.

38
00:04:49,157 --> 00:04:52,137
Stop bragging about how he gets
all the food in his mouth.

39
00:04:52,138 --> 00:04:55,003
- You try to kvell over your grandson.
- I won't complain.

40
00:04:55,004 --> 00:04:56,835
After 24 years, it's still rough.

41
00:04:56,836 --> 00:05:00,377
23, you forgot the year your goy
son-in-law wasn't allowed up here.

42
00:05:00,378 --> 00:05:03,581
- Time to let the angel in.
- Nat, how come the angel...

43
00:05:03,582 --> 00:05:04,817
Gets a bigger glass?

44
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:07,660
Your material is getting stale.

45
00:05:07,883 --> 00:05:10,303
Better leave the chain on.
This is the Bronx.

46
00:05:10,304 --> 00:05:13,845
Instead of Elijah, some mugger wearing
Reebock is gonna charge through the door.

47
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:16,114
- Adam's right.
- When you two gonna move out of here?

48
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:19,159
- You're too old to survive here.
- How old are you, Grandpa?

49
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,183
Nobody kept records in our day.
No one knows.

50
00:05:21,184 --> 00:05:23,395
They'll never tell.
Some crazy superstition.

51
00:05:23,396 --> 00:05:27,035
Not so crazy. You don't tempt God
by bragging about your age.

52
00:05:27,402 --> 00:05:28,410
Sit!

53
00:05:28,965 --> 00:05:31,964
Forty-two years here,
the neighborhood is not so bad.

54
00:05:32,141 --> 00:05:34,902
Then why can't I drive my
Cadillac to your Seder? Nat...

55
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,104
There are places in Flushing.
If it's a matter of money...

56
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,527
- I can chip in a few bucks.
- They wanna be the last.

57
00:05:41,528 --> 00:05:43,894
We'll chisel it on your stone
after the mugging.

58
00:05:43,895 --> 00:05:46,233
"Nat and Rose Gruden, the last
Jews on Davidson Avenue."

59
00:05:47,254 --> 00:05:48,573
Gruden residence.

60
00:05:51,512 --> 00:05:52,738
Hi, Jessie.

61
00:05:57,722 --> 00:05:59,354
Well, what time do you think
you'll be out?

62
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,651
Okay, no problem.

63
00:06:03,787 --> 00:06:04,967
Yeah, don't worry about it.

64
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,911
All right. Take care, Jessie.

65
00:06:10,945 --> 00:06:12,231
Your grandfather?

66
00:06:12,603 --> 00:06:14,051
What was that about, Adam?

67
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,511
Jessie wanted to wish us
a happy Passover.

68
00:06:18,238 --> 00:06:20,408
Vito, your father knows our number?

69
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:22,414
Yeah, how come?

70
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:25,138
Well, the unexpected.
Jessie doesn't change, huh?

71
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:26,433
No, he sure doesn't.

72
00:06:33,968 --> 00:06:35,081
Take care, Nat.

73
00:06:35,134 --> 00:06:37,033
Vito, see if you can get a cab,
I'll be right out.

74
00:06:37,034 --> 00:06:38,089
Alright.

75
00:06:38,123 --> 00:06:39,626
So when are you
moving, Grandma?

76
00:06:39,627 --> 00:06:41,403
We don't take
from our children.

77
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:44,302
You're like a couple of turkeys
in these streets.

78
00:06:44,391 --> 00:06:45,858
This neighborhood's
become a jungle.

79
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:49,120
I'm not coming to the next Seder
unless you're living somewhere else.

80
00:06:49,902 --> 00:06:52,636
Did you hear what your
grandson said, Ma?

81
00:06:54,771 --> 00:06:56,636
Well, what did he want?

82
00:06:57,343 --> 00:06:59,510
Jessie wanted to wish us
a happy Passover.

83
00:06:59,614 --> 00:07:01,519
Come on, Adam, stop the crap, uh?

84
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:04,546
Your old man needs bail money.

85
00:07:04,572 --> 00:07:05,758
I'm gonna go down there.

86
00:07:05,928 --> 00:07:06,905
And he calls you.

87
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:07,880
Yeah.

88
00:07:09,499 --> 00:07:11,092
So you've been talking
to my father...

89
00:07:11,093 --> 00:07:13,105
While you been ducking me
since you got back, uh?

90
00:07:14,465 --> 00:07:15,350
All right.

91
00:07:15,733 --> 00:07:16,949
Is it serious?

92
00:07:17,346 --> 00:07:18,421
It's a bar fight.

93
00:07:18,514 --> 00:07:20,214
But it's an off-duty cop
he whacked.

94
00:07:20,215 --> 00:07:21,589
He whacked a cop?

95
00:07:22,749 --> 00:07:24,118
Is the guy hurt?

96
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:26,124
Well, Grandpa says he...

97
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,354
"kicked the bull's ass...

98
00:07:27,355 --> 00:07:29,738
The length of the bar
and halfway down 10th Ave."

99
00:07:29,739 --> 00:07:31,225
When is he gonna to let up?

100
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:32,938
Oh, Christ.

101
00:07:33,257 --> 00:07:34,179
Well...

102
00:07:34,491 --> 00:07:37,050
What the hell, it's nice
to know I have strong genes.

103
00:07:37,413 --> 00:07:39,956
Hope I'm getting pinched
for bar fights in my 60s.

104
00:07:39,957 --> 00:07:43,409
Just remember, Adam,
along with those strong genes...

105
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,598
My father passes on a lot
of other crap to go with it.

106
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:49,558
- So stay away from him.
- He's not looking to hurt me.

107
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:50,475
No, he's not.

108
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:52,265
But it'll happen anyway.

109
00:07:52,758 --> 00:07:55,167
He'll spend the night in the can.
Fine with me.

110
00:07:57,766 --> 00:07:59,218
Lend me 800 dollars.

111
00:07:59,741 --> 00:08:00,495
Forget it.

112
00:08:00,496 --> 00:08:02,561
Last time I stood bail for him
was three years ago.

113
00:08:02,562 --> 00:08:03,796
I haven't heard from him since.

114
00:08:03,811 --> 00:08:06,062
I don't stand bail
for Jessie anymore.

115
00:08:06,063 --> 00:08:07,291
You're not standing bail.

116
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:08,851
I'm borrowing the money.

117
00:08:09,444 --> 00:08:11,928
I've got 200, I'd like 800 more.

118
00:08:12,323 --> 00:08:13,436
So it's for you?

119
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:14,254
Right!

120
00:08:22,924 --> 00:08:25,335
Adam, the last year
my mother was alive...

121
00:08:27,243 --> 00:08:29,177
I was 7 years old. Okay?

122
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:32,776
Jessie took me along Christmas Eve
to buy a tree, right?

123
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:36,225
Near midnight we're passing an
Esso station up near Riverdale...

124
00:08:36,226 --> 00:08:40,686
And right on top of the garage is
a perfect, all lit-up Christmas tree.

125
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:45,583
So Jessie hits the brakes and he says,
"Wow, what a score, it's even got lights."

126
00:08:45,584 --> 00:08:46,915
Wait a minute.

127
00:08:47,244 --> 00:08:51,854
I'm standing lookout, I was 7 years old,
while he climbs up the drainpipe...

128
00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:54,363
And pulls down the tree,
lights and all.

129
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,741
What's so funny?

130
00:08:55,853 --> 00:08:57,723
I got a dozen stories like that.

131
00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:02,589
Like helping him rob Lionel trains
out of Macy's when I was 12 years old.

132
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:05,389
He's working there, I had to cut school
because he decided...

133
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,358
To take a box of engines out.

134
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:09,113
He hought he'd get money for it.

135
00:09:09,114 --> 00:09:10,186
What happened?

136
00:09:10,486 --> 00:09:11,996
It doesn't matter
what happened.

137
00:09:13,075 --> 00:09:14,983
Just know who you're
dealing with. All right?

138
00:09:14,984 --> 00:09:16,062
All right, all right.

139
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,960
That's eight.

140
00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:24,348
Thanks.

141
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,659
That was nice what you did
in there... for them.

142
00:09:30,724 --> 00:09:32,885
They might get out of this
cesspool because of you.

143
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,839
Well, I had them over a barrel.

144
00:09:35,238 --> 00:09:38,517
Somebody loves you, you got a hell of
a weapon in the relationship, you know?

145
00:09:42,023 --> 00:09:43,230
Hey!

146
00:09:45,812 --> 00:09:48,508
Listen, it's supposed
to work both ways, kiddo.

147
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:52,108
I mean, if you love somebody back,
then they got an equal weapon, no?

148
00:09:52,109 --> 00:09:54,526
You're right, pa.
I guess we got a standoff.

149
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:57,703
- I guess we do.
- They may move. I think you did it.

150
00:09:57,704 --> 00:09:59,274
- I better get a cab.
- Good.

151
00:09:59,275 --> 00:10:00,447
How about dinner next week?

152
00:10:00,448 --> 00:10:02,588
Oh, sure. What time
should we be there?

153
00:10:03,723 --> 00:10:05,432
You did want Christine, no?

154
00:10:05,697 --> 00:10:06,867
Of course, Adam.

155
00:10:06,868 --> 00:10:10,370
You know Christine's always welcome.
You wanna catch a ride with us?

156
00:10:10,371 --> 00:10:12,965
- No, thanks.
- Okay, good night, Adam.

157
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:15,666
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Why doesn't he wanna ride with us?

158
00:10:15,936 --> 00:10:19,862
Docket number 178649325.

159
00:10:29,215 --> 00:10:31,730
The charge is second-degree
assault, Your Honor.

160
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:36,152
At 6 p.m. yesterday, in a bar and grill
at 50210th Avenue...

161
00:10:36,153 --> 00:10:38,119
Mr. McMullen assaulted...

162
00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:40,099
An off-duty policeman.

163
00:10:40,324 --> 00:10:43,674
Well, I'd love to hear about this
in your own words, Mr...

164
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,158
McMullen.

165
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,307
Your Honor...

166
00:10:47,845 --> 00:10:50,086
I'm a victim of police brutality.

167
00:10:50,087 --> 00:10:52,472
Just tell us what occurred,
Mr. McMullen.

168
00:10:53,526 --> 00:10:54,674
Well...

169
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:57,206
It all happened so fast,
Your Honor.

170
00:10:57,861 --> 00:10:59,222
I'll try to remember.

171
00:11:00,204 --> 00:11:01,495
We had an argument.

172
00:11:01,558 --> 00:11:03,142
To be fair about it...

173
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,479
I was as much at fault
as he was.

174
00:11:06,511 --> 00:11:08,665
Well, one thing led
to another and...

175
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,024
Somehow it comes out...

176
00:11:10,025 --> 00:11:12,174
That my mother was
a Native American...

177
00:11:12,818 --> 00:11:14,792
A full-blooded Cherokee,
Your Honor.

178
00:11:15,737 --> 00:11:17,760
And this policeman yells...

179
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:21,095
"It's too bad Custer made such
a half-ass job of it."

180
00:11:22,037 --> 00:11:23,572
Well, I lost control.

181
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,327
What did you do?

182
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:28,745
I did what little I could
for a man my age.

183
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:32,709
The little Mr. McMullen was able to do seems
to have been pretty effective, Your Honor.

184
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:37,195
The officer has taken 18 stitches
in his face, his nose is broken...

185
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,909
And his jaw is wired up.

186
00:11:39,313 --> 00:11:41,416
I must've hit him harder
than I knew.

187
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:43,877
it was fright, fear, whatever it was,
Your Honor.

188
00:11:43,878 --> 00:11:47,188
Your Honor, here is the BCI
on Mr. Jessie McMullen.

189
00:11:47,189 --> 00:11:53,244
It begins in 1947 with a three-year term
for assault just after he was naturalized.

190
00:11:53,642 --> 00:11:56,348
It goes on and on and on and...

191
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:57,431
Your Honor...!

192
00:11:58,158 --> 00:12:00,885
Before the prosecutor
sentences my client...

193
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,823
Perhaps he will agree to a trial?

194
00:12:03,904 --> 00:12:05,620
We're only here to set bail.

195
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:09,760
I'd like to point out that the defendant's
grandson is present in court.

196
00:12:10,013 --> 00:12:12,140
My client has roots in this community.

197
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,855
Bail is set at 5,000 dollars.

198
00:12:15,856 --> 00:12:19,668
A 500-dollar cash bail
bond is acceptable.

199
00:12:20,858 --> 00:12:22,127
Next.

200
00:12:22,223 --> 00:12:26,353
Docket number 178649326.

201
00:12:26,614 --> 00:12:27,917
Did you bring the 500?

202
00:12:30,432 --> 00:12:32,059
You don't travel light, I see.

203
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,698
Vito gave me 800.

204
00:12:33,724 --> 00:12:35,130
Good thing he had the cash.

205
00:12:35,131 --> 00:12:38,230
Your father's always got a few grand
swag money in his pocket.

206
00:12:38,408 --> 00:12:40,501
He robs the tax collector,
your father.

207
00:12:40,936 --> 00:12:43,730
It's never been easy for me
having a thief in the family.

208
00:12:44,705 --> 00:12:45,908
You've grown, Adam.

209
00:12:46,356 --> 00:12:47,761
It's been a long time.

210
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,054
Money.

211
00:12:54,361 --> 00:12:55,523
Oh, money.

212
00:13:03,143 --> 00:13:04,218
Look at this.

213
00:13:04,463 --> 00:13:05,921
It's become a shithouse.

214
00:13:06,433 --> 00:13:08,060
Never been in a jail before.

215
00:13:08,061 --> 00:13:10,078
You haven't missed an awful lot.

216
00:13:10,104 --> 00:13:12,330
It's got some good points too,
when you're young.

217
00:13:12,331 --> 00:13:13,202
Like what?

218
00:13:13,203 --> 00:13:14,592
It can help build character...

219
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:15,999
Like a hitch in the Army.

220
00:13:16,831 --> 00:13:19,640
A wallet. A watch.
A handkerchief, pure silk.

221
00:13:19,747 --> 00:13:22,171
Not to mention 270,000 dollars.

222
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,528
I'm just kidding. 270 dollars.

223
00:13:25,654 --> 00:13:26,702
Hey, Jessie!

224
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:27,619
Hi, John!

225
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,194
Jezez what this place
keeps going downhill.

226
00:13:29,195 --> 00:13:30,954
Yeah, just like the
rest of the city.

227
00:13:34,743 --> 00:13:36,069
You're looking good, Adam.

228
00:13:36,384 --> 00:13:38,568
These fancy schools must
be agreeing with you.

229
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,405
MIT's not fancy.

230
00:13:40,915 --> 00:13:42,246
And they don't, Jessie.

231
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,295
They really don't agree with me at all.

232
00:13:45,461 --> 00:13:48,436
Last night in the bar,
did that cop land the first punch?

233
00:13:48,821 --> 00:13:51,045
Adam, I've never been
in a bar fight yet...

234
00:13:51,046 --> 00:13:53,046
Where the other guy
landed the first punch.

235
00:13:53,072 --> 00:13:55,309
It's a sure recipe for losing.

236
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:58,170
So when did you
get back in town?

237
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:00,272
I left school in January.

238
00:14:01,116 --> 00:14:04,397
I was this far away from getting
my master's in molecular biology.

239
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:06,342
And your old man's
paying for all this?

240
00:14:06,553 --> 00:14:08,317
No way. I'm on
full scholarship.

241
00:14:08,803 --> 00:14:10,503
I was a Westinghouse Scholar.

242
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:13,316
It's a big deal.
They only have six each year.

243
00:14:14,292 --> 00:14:15,350
I hated it.

244
00:14:15,673 --> 00:14:17,309
It felt worse than that cell.

245
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:20,420
They've got your whole life
mapped out for you.

246
00:14:21,085 --> 00:14:22,438
You don't know the half of it.

247
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,186
I would have had my own lab...

248
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:25,709
Terrific salary...

249
00:14:26,008 --> 00:14:27,152
The works.

250
00:14:28,402 --> 00:14:31,073
They were already talking to me
about a retirement plan.

251
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,816
I've been living with a girl
up on 23rd Street.

252
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:37,397
An older girl.

253
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,073
Nothing wrong with an older woman.

254
00:14:40,488 --> 00:14:41,730
For a young man.

255
00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:45,420
My mother's okay.

256
00:14:45,827 --> 00:14:48,153
Vito tries, but he
makes me feel guilty.

257
00:14:48,247 --> 00:14:50,897
Your father can be
pretty good at that.

258
00:14:51,022 --> 00:14:52,342
Hey, Jess!

259
00:14:52,405 --> 00:14:55,503
Hi, Phil. Say hello to Adam,
my grandson.

260
00:14:56,013 --> 00:14:57,589
- Vito's boy.
- Hi, Phil.

261
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,974
Hey, I remember you.

262
00:14:58,975 --> 00:15:00,975
What've you been doing
with yourself lately?

263
00:15:01,394 --> 00:15:02,622
Finding myself.

264
00:15:02,984 --> 00:15:05,260
Well, I hope you've been
getting laid in the process.

265
00:15:05,632 --> 00:15:06,569
What do you got?

266
00:15:06,827 --> 00:15:08,006
Ferragamos.

267
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:11,408
300 a pair all along Madison Avenue,
fell off a truck this morning.

268
00:15:11,585 --> 00:15:13,194
Fifty dollars a pair.

269
00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:14,138
13C?

270
00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:14,768
Right.

271
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:16,691
- You got it.
- What do you take?

272
00:15:19,757 --> 00:15:21,405
9 1/2 C.

273
00:15:21,431 --> 00:15:22,569
No problem.

274
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:28,139
- There you go.
- Thanks.

275
00:15:28,155 --> 00:15:30,144
By the way, say hello
to your father for me.

276
00:15:30,145 --> 00:15:32,589
Me and him used to cut a lot
of corners when we were kids.

277
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:34,355
Take it easy.

278
00:15:36,107 --> 00:15:38,202
Not in the bar, bad luck.

279
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,678
You can get trees for them.

280
00:15:42,387 --> 00:15:44,027
You're a class act, Jessie.

281
00:15:44,886 --> 00:15:48,308
I still remember those stretch limos
out to Shea when I was 12.

282
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:52,565
Yeah, the driver was working off
a gambling debt.

283
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:54,811
It was a wonderful way to travel, no?

284
00:15:55,825 --> 00:15:57,003
Cheers.

285
00:16:00,054 --> 00:16:02,264
Those piers used to hum.

286
00:16:02,927 --> 00:16:05,105
Half the West Side
worked on the docks.

287
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:07,448
The pickings were great.

288
00:16:08,073 --> 00:16:10,769
That's where I landed...
right over there.

289
00:16:12,168 --> 00:16:13,623
September '46.

290
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:15,356
My grandmother?

291
00:16:15,357 --> 00:16:16,620
Yeah.

292
00:16:17,423 --> 00:16:19,581
Those happy years for the
two of you, grandpa?

293
00:16:19,582 --> 00:16:21,978
Happy? Married to a Sicilian?

294
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:23,799
Happiness is against their nature.

295
00:16:24,207 --> 00:16:27,006
She spent every waking hour
cooking fucking pasta.

296
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:28,819
She had me pissing olive oil.

297
00:16:28,992 --> 00:16:31,198
You be careful,
you got some of that blood.

298
00:16:31,661 --> 00:16:34,816
Try to encourage
the Scottish genes, Adam.

299
00:16:35,756 --> 00:16:39,129
Wonder how Vito would've turned out
if you'd married somebody Scottish.

300
00:16:39,137 --> 00:16:41,491
He'd have had a proper
first name, for a start.

301
00:16:41,492 --> 00:16:42,797
Instead of Vito.

302
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:45,131
And he'd have been at least
five inches taller.

303
00:16:52,955 --> 00:16:54,816
That was a terrific night, Jessie.

304
00:16:56,501 --> 00:16:58,366
Some bacon and eggs,
a couple drinks.

305
00:17:00,735 --> 00:17:04,364
When I called, it wasn't just
to get together after all this time.

306
00:17:04,985 --> 00:17:05,804
No?

307
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:06,812
No. I wanted...

308
00:17:07,391 --> 00:17:09,600
I really wanted to ask
you about something.

309
00:17:10,272 --> 00:17:11,497
Your opinion.

310
00:17:11,638 --> 00:17:12,837
What?

311
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,400
There's an ex-professor of mine,
he's a brilliant Chinese-American guy...

312
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,735
And he's got a scam.

313
00:17:22,654 --> 00:17:25,122
Says it's a good deal,
as easy as could be.

314
00:17:25,864 --> 00:17:27,991
Nobody ever tells you a deal's hard, kid.

315
00:17:29,436 --> 00:17:30,962
Well, he needs an answer.

316
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:34,884
I've stalled him for a couple of weeks,
but now he says he needs an answer.

317
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,853
Says it means a lot of money.

318
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,181
What's a Chinaman's idea
of a lot of money?

319
00:17:42,121 --> 00:17:43,524
A million dollars.

320
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,329
More coffee, fellas?

321
00:17:48,545 --> 00:17:50,358
Leave it to me.
I'll get Vito here.

322
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:51,369
See you later.

323
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,501
I'm going upstairs
for a shower and a shave.

324
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,306
- So I'll meet you here at 3?
- Right!

325
00:17:56,348 --> 00:17:59,106
But leave your old man to me.
I know which buttons to press, Ok?

326
00:17:59,107 --> 00:18:00,151
All right.

327
00:18:05,964 --> 00:18:07,448
Hello, stranger.

328
00:18:08,144 --> 00:18:10,570
When they become a success,
they forget their roots.

329
00:18:10,628 --> 00:18:11,566
Vito!

330
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,929
Glad to see you back
on the West Side.

331
00:18:14,224 --> 00:18:16,772
I remember Vito here
before he could talk.

332
00:18:17,278 --> 00:18:20,111
Your grandfather was
running numbers out of this bar.

333
00:18:20,335 --> 00:18:22,813
He'd bring Vito down in his
baby carriage...

334
00:18:22,814 --> 00:18:24,212
And park him right here...

335
00:18:24,408 --> 00:18:27,070
Then tuck his policy slips
in your old man's blanket.

336
00:18:27,267 --> 00:18:29,102
That's how I learned to count.

337
00:18:29,688 --> 00:18:31,000
How are you, Jessie?

338
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:32,704
I pinched your
father more than once.

339
00:18:32,969 --> 00:18:34,180
You're Doheny the cop?

340
00:18:34,337 --> 00:18:35,454
That's me!

341
00:18:36,251 --> 00:18:37,908
You were too little to run in.

342
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:40,537
He means Vito was too little
to shake down.

343
00:18:40,999 --> 00:18:42,491
Danny here would pinch me.

344
00:18:42,816 --> 00:18:46,547
Then when I made bail, he'd come right
upstairs and sell me back my own slips.

345
00:18:46,712 --> 00:18:47,654
You retired?

346
00:18:48,303 --> 00:18:49,763
I took early retirement.

347
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,725
The commissioner
insisted on it.

348
00:18:51,748 --> 00:18:52,897
Thank the good Lord...

349
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,100
I had a little money put by.

350
00:18:54,126 --> 00:18:55,758
You still hide it
in the coffee cans?

351
00:18:57,163 --> 00:18:59,460
- What do you drink?
- Dewar's rocks, Danny.

352
00:19:00,949 --> 00:19:02,068
Nice guy.

353
00:19:02,287 --> 00:19:04,326
Adam, you gotta learn to
judge people better.

354
00:19:06,068 --> 00:19:08,263
You two seem pretty cozy
all of a sudden.

355
00:19:08,797 --> 00:19:11,241
Hey, I'm his granddad,
for chrissakes.

356
00:19:11,377 --> 00:19:14,749
Whatever craziness you're
cooking up these days, Jessie...

357
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,078
Adam can do without.

358
00:19:16,394 --> 00:19:19,522
I'm a man trying his best
to enjoy his golden years.

359
00:19:19,523 --> 00:19:22,180
Yeah, just keep my son away
from your criminal schemes.

360
00:19:22,808 --> 00:19:24,968
Criminal schemes.

361
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,858
Probably eating you up that
you're getting old, you know?

362
00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:30,578
Let no man say that Jessie Mac
went out lying down.

363
00:19:30,693 --> 00:19:34,100
Criminal schemes. That's a little rich
coming from an ex-con.

364
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:39,898
You told him about that?

365
00:19:39,952 --> 00:19:42,316
Pop, Pop, 20 years in the
same house.

366
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,860
Some things can't stay secret.

367
00:19:43,862 --> 00:19:45,746
Just don't fuck up his life too.

368
00:19:45,866 --> 00:19:46,899
- Too?
- Yeah!

369
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:50,436
Any deal you ever made with me,
you never saw a speck of trouble.

370
00:19:50,576 --> 00:19:54,846
It's when you took off on your own, like
an asshole with that retarded Polack...

371
00:19:54,847 --> 00:19:57,468
That you wound up doing
your 27 months in the shitter.

372
00:19:58,097 --> 00:19:59,741
And he's still blaming me.

373
00:20:00,254 --> 00:20:01,971
If you'd stuck with me...

374
00:20:01,972 --> 00:20:04,483
You'd have been
a part of that Westport Bank caper.

375
00:20:04,775 --> 00:20:08,241
So sweet.
200,000 chopped up four ways.

376
00:20:08,301 --> 00:20:10,163
Ask him where the money is now.

377
00:20:10,172 --> 00:20:12,694
Just where it ought to be.
It didn't have handles on it.

378
00:20:12,922 --> 00:20:16,576
Always remember, Adam. It only
costs 100% more to go first class.

379
00:20:16,577 --> 00:20:19,116
Ask him about the downside
to a glamorous life...

380
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:20,585
The couple of years you
sit in the cage...

381
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,379
Then spend the rest
of your life trying to hide it.

382
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,391
Horseshit! Anybody who's embarrassed
about doing time is a goddamned snob.

383
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:29,977
You do your time nice, don't rat
anybody out, never take it in the ass...

384
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:32,020
What is there to be
embarrassed about, eh?

385
00:20:32,734 --> 00:20:33,734
Vito!

386
00:20:33,944 --> 00:20:37,192
Somewhere your values
got screwy.

387
00:20:37,421 --> 00:20:39,084
When the hell did you get it
in your head...

388
00:20:39,085 --> 00:20:41,512
That it was so terrible to be a thief?

389
00:20:41,513 --> 00:20:44,204
How do you get through to someone
who thinks like a Gypsy?

390
00:20:44,205 --> 00:20:46,606
- Right. Standup thieves, Gypsies.
- Right.

391
00:20:46,607 --> 00:20:48,667
Not a hypocritical bone in their bodies.

392
00:20:48,926 --> 00:20:50,340
Hey, Margie!

393
00:20:51,449 --> 00:20:52,581
You made bail.

394
00:20:52,582 --> 00:20:54,964
Yeah! Thanks to my
grandson Adam here.

395
00:20:54,973 --> 00:20:56,956
And my wonderful son Vito.

396
00:20:56,957 --> 00:20:59,268
How do you do?
It's nice to know you, Adam.

397
00:20:59,269 --> 00:21:00,237
Hi.

398
00:21:00,238 --> 00:21:01,785
Vito? Margie.

399
00:21:02,292 --> 00:21:05,645
So how are the accommodations
at the tombs these days?

400
00:21:05,661 --> 00:21:07,913
- Three-star? Four-star?
- I'll survive.

401
00:21:07,915 --> 00:21:09,964
There was never any question
about that.

402
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,731
But did the other prisoners survive?
What about the poor guards?

403
00:21:14,015 --> 00:21:16,958
I don't go on for 15 minutes.
Can I buy you guys a drink?

404
00:21:16,959 --> 00:21:19,567
- No, we'll take a rain check.
- Oh, man talk.

405
00:21:19,568 --> 00:21:21,832
- Okay, see you later.
- Okay.

406
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,418
- Listen, we still on for tonight?
- Yeah, sure.

407
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:26,871
It was very nice meeting you.

408
00:21:29,269 --> 00:21:30,113
Jessie...

409
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:32,590
Jessie, are you involving
Adam in something?

410
00:21:33,544 --> 00:21:37,830
- Just the safest, sweetest deal of my life.
- All right, stop right there...

411
00:21:37,831 --> 00:21:39,886
And he's not involving me,
it's my idea.

412
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:41,238
Your idea?

413
00:21:41,261 --> 00:21:43,222
My idea. That's right.

414
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:46,301
Adam, what are you talking about?

415
00:21:47,601 --> 00:21:49,848
I'm talking about a
lot of money, Pop.

416
00:21:49,874 --> 00:21:51,223
And it's not even dangerous.

417
00:21:51,251 --> 00:21:53,183
No, no, no, if it's against
the law, it's dangerous.

418
00:21:53,184 --> 00:21:55,005
No, no, this is a walk.

419
00:21:55,037 --> 00:21:58,277
- And it just needs a third guy.
- Needs a third guy, huh?

420
00:21:58,278 --> 00:22:01,275
Are you crazy? I spent my life
thieving with my father...

421
00:22:01,276 --> 00:22:03,948
And now I'm gonna thieve with my son?
The two of you, are you crazy?

422
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:06,212
Must be a full moon
I don't know about, alright?

423
00:22:06,213 --> 00:22:08,784
Now, you tell me, what is it
with these criminal genes?

424
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:12,870
Jesus, Vito. Don't get started
with that criminal-gene crap.

425
00:22:13,995 --> 00:22:17,468
Carnegie, Rockefeller. Those are
the guys with criminal genes...

426
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,214
The size of fucking grapefruits.

427
00:22:21,535 --> 00:22:24,737
You never really bought
that honesty shit.

428
00:22:25,564 --> 00:22:28,088
You've just been running scared
for 25 years.

429
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:29,353
I'm scared for him.

430
00:22:29,354 --> 00:22:31,508
I'm not a baby.
Let me be scared for me.

431
00:22:31,524 --> 00:22:34,042
If they catch you, haven't they lock you up.
Now, listen to me.

432
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,643
I learned long ago it's not
safe to be a thief, alright?

433
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,912
- Safe, you wanna get safe?
- Yeah, I wanna get safe.

434
00:22:38,923 --> 00:22:42,909
Go sit in one of your walk-in refrigerators
for the rest of your life, for chrissake.

435
00:22:43,418 --> 00:22:47,159
Who the hell put it in your head that
being safe is what life is all about?

436
00:22:47,227 --> 00:22:49,713
- I'm too young to play it safe.
- And me too.

437
00:22:50,841 --> 00:22:52,527
This is fucking cuckoo.

438
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:56,649
Can I get another one?

439
00:22:56,823 --> 00:22:57,988
Give him two.

440
00:22:59,228 --> 00:23:00,493
Alright Adam...

441
00:23:00,524 --> 00:23:01,673
Let me get this straight.

442
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,769
You'll jeopardize your
whole life for money?

443
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:05,048
- For money?
- Yeah.

444
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:08,486
Pop, if it was money I wanted, I'd think
about the wholesale meat business.

445
00:23:09,494 --> 00:23:10,940
Well, that was unfair.

446
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:13,424
You know I hate the fucking
meat business.

447
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:15,959
I broke my ass to give you
what he never gave me.

448
00:23:16,579 --> 00:23:18,878
- I never asked you for anything.
- You never had to.

449
00:23:19,421 --> 00:23:21,284
You had everything a kid ever wanted.

450
00:23:21,662 --> 00:23:25,633
You didn't even need a scholarship.
I could have paid for your college twice.

451
00:23:25,634 --> 00:23:27,485
- Without blinking.
- Pop.

452
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:30,026
This whole thing
has nothing to do with money.

453
00:23:30,579 --> 00:23:32,838
You've never understood me,
you still don't.

454
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:37,477
You're not doing this.

455
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:39,262
I'm doing it.

456
00:23:39,601 --> 00:23:41,885
Whether you come or not.
Whether he comes or not.

457
00:23:43,579 --> 00:23:46,305
You wanna know something?
There's nothing you can do about it.

458
00:23:48,163 --> 00:23:49,282
Nothing I can do?

459
00:23:49,527 --> 00:23:50,480
Right.

460
00:23:51,367 --> 00:23:52,837
There's nothing I can do?

461
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:18,877
Vito.

462
00:24:20,136 --> 00:24:21,994
That won't get you anywhere.

463
00:24:32,887 --> 00:24:33,945
Here.

464
00:24:34,255 --> 00:24:37,591
Leave a 20. I don't want Doheny
telling people I raised a cheapskate.

465
00:24:55,594 --> 00:25:00,045
Come on. Hey! We got a deadline!
Let's go, man.

466
00:25:13,591 --> 00:25:16,737
Vito! Jesus, it's still dark out.

467
00:25:16,738 --> 00:25:18,770
You know, it's the early worm
gets caught.

468
00:25:18,771 --> 00:25:22,075
If it's about bail money, Jessie,
I'm about tapped out.

469
00:25:22,076 --> 00:25:23,495
I got work to do.

470
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:27,396
I got bigger fish to fry
than a few bucks bail money.

471
00:25:27,426 --> 00:25:29,099
- Oh, yeah?
- But first of all...

472
00:25:29,749 --> 00:25:33,237
Who the hell smacks
a 23-year-old in public?

473
00:25:33,261 --> 00:25:35,695
Punish him if you really
lose your temper, Vito.

474
00:25:35,981 --> 00:25:37,417
But not a slap.

475
00:25:38,748 --> 00:25:39,942
Look...

476
00:25:39,943 --> 00:25:41,629
Adam and I are meeting
at the weekend...

477
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:44,013
With a third guy, for this score.

478
00:25:44,014 --> 00:25:45,721
You've got till then to decide.

479
00:25:45,722 --> 00:25:49,270
No, there's nothing to decide.
If anything happens to Adam...

480
00:25:49,271 --> 00:25:51,753
This is why you should come along.

481
00:25:51,936 --> 00:25:54,120
Blood, Vito, blood.

482
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,560
And it's the kind of work
you do to a turn.

483
00:25:56,561 --> 00:25:58,717
He's going anyway, you heard him.

484
00:25:58,981 --> 00:26:02,120
- He'll find two other guys.
- But you could talk him out of it.

485
00:26:03,482 --> 00:26:05,498
- I doubt it.
- Try.

486
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,247
I'm not gonna try something
I don't believe in.

487
00:26:08,248 --> 00:26:11,221
- Why not?
- It's as sweet for me as it is for Adam.

488
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,990
It's your choice.

489
00:26:14,253 --> 00:26:18,596
I have another guy lined up, he's not
as good as you, but he's good enough.

490
00:26:19,089 --> 00:26:20,190
Who?

491
00:26:21,879 --> 00:26:24,005
- You've got till the weekend.
- Wait a minute, who?

492
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:27,136
Who?

493
00:26:36,184 --> 00:26:37,214
Who?

494
00:26:38,286 --> 00:26:39,299
Johnny Hunt.

495
00:26:39,835 --> 00:26:40,987
Johnny Hunt.

496
00:26:41,251 --> 00:26:45,210
Well, you remember. His kid brother
got shot robbing a bank.

497
00:26:45,224 --> 00:26:48,362
- Johnny Hunt!
- He was never as bad as people said.

498
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:50,738
He was a weasel 30 years ago,
he's still a weasel.

499
00:26:50,739 --> 00:26:53,699
People get people a bum rap sometimes.

500
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,512
Johnny Hunt is a hell of a crib man.

501
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:58,745
- He stinks, Jessie.
- I think you're wrong.

502
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,431
But I wanted to give you
the shot at it.

503
00:27:01,432 --> 00:27:02,550
Jessie!

504
00:27:03,549 --> 00:27:04,737
Jessie!

505
00:27:04,738 --> 00:27:06,355
The guy stinks!

506
00:27:10,617 --> 00:27:13,397
- So, what's the story with Torres?
- I checked the carton...

507
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:15,260
He packed for Jimmy's Tavern.
I knew it.

508
00:27:15,261 --> 00:27:18,774
It was marked for 20 pounds of
short ribs and 30 pounds of chop.

509
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:20,557
There were three fillets in it.

510
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:22,111
About an 80-dollar difference.

511
00:27:22,112 --> 00:27:23,963
You give the kid every break you can.

512
00:27:23,964 --> 00:27:26,064
- What do you wanna do?
- Send him in.

513
00:27:26,065 --> 00:27:29,198
Tommy, he sticks a boning knife
in his belt, you buzz me.

514
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:30,215
All right.

515
00:27:30,246 --> 00:27:31,237
All right.

516
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:34,058
That fucking kid. Listen...

517
00:27:35,605 --> 00:27:38,813
Figure out what we owe Torres
as of yesterday afternoon.

518
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,558
- Stealing?
- Yeah.

519
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,243
Two-forty, gross.

520
00:27:46,346 --> 00:27:48,053
What good is gross gonna do me?

521
00:27:48,054 --> 00:27:51,483
You were a lot nicer boss when
we used to get laid once in a while.

522
00:27:51,484 --> 00:27:54,641
- The usual 12 fictitious dependents.
- Come on, how much?

523
00:27:55,077 --> 00:27:58,834
178.30. I don't think you get
enough sex these days.

524
00:27:58,835 --> 00:28:01,047
It wasn't meant to last.
There's an old saying...

525
00:28:01,048 --> 00:28:02,594
"You don't crap where you eat."

526
00:28:02,595 --> 00:28:06,091
Listen to 20 years in the world of
commerce from the female point of view:

527
00:28:06,092 --> 00:28:08,919
Every guy who told you that
banged his bookkeeper.

528
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,936
- How much was it?
- One seventy-eight and 30 cents.

529
00:28:12,434 --> 00:28:13,545
Yeah, come on.

530
00:28:14,853 --> 00:28:16,562
Tommy says you wanted to see me?

531
00:28:16,563 --> 00:28:18,263
Here's your pay through yesterday.

532
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,935
Today's money goes toward
the meat you been robbing.

533
00:28:20,936 --> 00:28:23,734
Be out in five minutes
or I'll break your fucking legs.

534
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:24,782
Robbing?

535
00:28:25,073 --> 00:28:26,173
Me, man?

536
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:31,482
Wanna open up the boxes
for Jimmy's Tavern?

537
00:28:32,115 --> 00:28:34,934
Go ahead. Go ahead, open them up.

538
00:28:34,935 --> 00:28:38,543
Man, how am I gonna live
on the shit wages you paying?

539
00:28:38,544 --> 00:28:41,933
Where'd you come to borrow money
when your baby had pneumonia, Julio?

540
00:28:41,934 --> 00:28:44,840
Where? We treated you
like family here, right?

541
00:28:44,841 --> 00:28:48,009
Yeh, but you just better hope
your family all stay healthy.

542
00:28:48,595 --> 00:28:49,609
What did you say?

543
00:28:49,832 --> 00:28:51,280
I said you take...

544
00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:08,921
You busted my nose, man.

545
00:29:11,802 --> 00:29:14,522
- You working for a maniac, lady.
- Come on, go.

546
00:29:14,757 --> 00:29:17,929
He busted my beak
over a piece of meat.

547
00:29:31,568 --> 00:29:34,053
Is this what's called a midlife crisis?

548
00:29:45,832 --> 00:29:48,671
Goodbye and God bless you,
Danny Doheny.

549
00:29:49,073 --> 00:29:52,195
Come on. It'll make you
feel better, Mrs. Doheny.

550
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,535
If you're here to start
smacking me around again...

551
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:30,054
No. I'm sorry about that.
I apologize.

552
00:30:30,667 --> 00:30:31,503
Accepted.

553
00:30:32,155 --> 00:30:33,392
Let's forget it.

554
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,140
I didn't expect to see you here.

555
00:30:36,195 --> 00:30:38,359
Guy was serving us drinks
four days ago.

556
00:30:38,963 --> 00:30:39,906
Yeah.

557
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:46,760
You can't wheel my casket
dolly around the place.

558
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:48,991
This is a wake.
There ought to be a little decorum.

559
00:30:48,992 --> 00:30:52,147
There's a barrel of beer on its way,
we need to set it on something.

560
00:30:52,148 --> 00:30:55,248
Not in my place. The Board of Health
can close me.

561
00:30:55,249 --> 00:30:58,800
Neary, since you've gone AA,
you're like a wet rag.

562
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,679
It's illegal to even bring beer in here.

563
00:31:06,851 --> 00:31:09,684
Neary... The mortician.

564
00:31:09,814 --> 00:31:13,904
His sister Margaret, an ex-nun,
used to own a very classy, expensive...

565
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:16,027
Nursery school down on Gramercy Park.

566
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:17,980
You interviewed for that.

567
00:31:18,022 --> 00:31:20,921
- An interview for a nursery school?
- It was very fancy.

568
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,292
What did they ask me?

569
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,136
You kow, what you watched on TV...

570
00:31:24,137 --> 00:31:25,799
Did you know your ABCs...

571
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,449
Of course I knew my ABCs.

572
00:31:27,506 --> 00:31:28,573
Adam...

573
00:31:28,668 --> 00:31:32,496
You read an entire New York Times
editorial on the U.N.

574
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:36,319
- Adam, you missed exactly five words.
- Spare me the rest.

575
00:31:36,343 --> 00:31:38,987
- They offer me a scholarship?
- A scholarship?

576
00:31:39,109 --> 00:31:42,366
They would have paid 1,000-dollar a
semester just to get their hands on you.

577
00:31:42,956 --> 00:31:45,554
They wanted me for what
all the other schools did.

578
00:31:45,632 --> 00:31:49,374
Solve geometry problems in
the fourth grade for important visitors.

579
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:52,968
I used to feel like a performing seal
at the blackboard.

580
00:31:53,777 --> 00:31:54,691
Adam...

581
00:31:55,034 --> 00:31:56,042
You were so gifted.

582
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:57,807
Let's just drop it, Pop.

583
00:31:57,808 --> 00:31:59,623
A gift shouldn't be thrown
in the garbage.

584
00:31:59,624 --> 00:32:03,513
- This is not the time or the place...
- This is the perfect time and place.

585
00:32:03,531 --> 00:32:05,441
See, I was raised to be a thief.

586
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,629
You weren't.

587
00:32:07,198 --> 00:32:11,897
- You don't have to go along.
- No, you, you don't have to go along.

588
00:32:11,945 --> 00:32:15,156
- That's the real point.
- I wanna go along.

589
00:32:19,063 --> 00:32:22,483
Your mom and I had such
enormous hopes for you, kiddo.

590
00:32:24,221 --> 00:32:26,687
- Nobody's hopes work out, Pop.
- Right.

591
00:32:27,985 --> 00:32:30,320
I'm half your age, I already know that.

592
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,523
Well, a toast seems appropriate.

593
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:39,335
- To Danny Doheny.
- To hell with him.

594
00:32:39,623 --> 00:32:40,921
To McMullens.

595
00:32:47,505 --> 00:32:49,349
Now then, lucky lads...

596
00:32:49,684 --> 00:32:52,067
Let's catch up on a little
family business.

597
00:32:52,068 --> 00:32:55,084
Yeah. Nothing like a good robbery
to bring a family close.

598
00:32:55,169 --> 00:32:57,997
He's such a fucking
wisenheimer, your father.

599
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,469
Does he do the same to you?

600
00:32:59,907 --> 00:33:01,741
Probably a little
less than I do to him.

601
00:33:02,182 --> 00:33:03,430
Let's make a decision.

602
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,114
- Let's.
- Talk.

603
00:33:09,701 --> 00:33:11,965
Are you familiar at all
with DNA research?

604
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:14,887
Yeah, I read a couple
of magazine articles.

605
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:17,927
Gene-splicing.
You know, they're breeding chickens...

606
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,512
That weigh more than you or me.

607
00:33:19,935 --> 00:33:21,282
Try to keep current, huh?

608
00:33:21,348 --> 00:33:23,950
Well, nobody knows
what's gonna happen yet...

609
00:33:24,005 --> 00:33:26,255
But the possibilities look limitless.

610
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:29,139
The small companies
who are in it first...

611
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,716
Are hoping to be the IBMs and
the Bell Telephones 20 years from now.

612
00:33:33,648 --> 00:33:36,536
There's a new red-hot,
very secret development.

613
00:33:37,137 --> 00:33:40,927
It's an agricultural plasmid.
Yeasts that are fixing nitrogen.

614
00:33:41,381 --> 00:33:44,005
That means that you could
raise wheat, corn...

615
00:33:44,052 --> 00:33:46,825
Damn near anything to grow
with no fertilizer.

616
00:33:48,051 --> 00:33:50,042
The stakes are enormous.
Farmers spend billions...

617
00:33:50,043 --> 00:33:52,399
Fuck the farmers.
Tell him what our end is.

618
00:33:53,897 --> 00:33:56,066
Jimmy Chiu,
an ex-professor of mine...

619
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,950
He works at a biology lab
out in Nassau County.

620
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:01,434
He helped found the company.

621
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:04,168
They screwed him out
of his piece of the action.

622
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:06,378
They fired this poor Chink.

623
00:34:06,379 --> 00:34:07,626
Yeah, I hear him.

624
00:34:08,318 --> 00:34:11,617
He's got some venture capital ready
to set up a new company.

625
00:34:12,262 --> 00:34:14,223
They need the new plasmids.

626
00:34:15,192 --> 00:34:16,501
He gets us in easy.

627
00:34:16,902 --> 00:34:17,993
High stakes.

628
00:34:18,073 --> 00:34:19,055
Low risk.

629
00:34:19,454 --> 00:34:20,561
Nonviolent.

630
00:34:20,612 --> 00:34:24,321
No worries about our partners
robbing us or ratting us out.

631
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:27,487
Look, if we get the plasmids
and the logbook...

632
00:34:27,856 --> 00:34:30,153
Jimmy Chiu pays us
an even million.

633
00:34:30,991 --> 00:34:33,911
You gotta sell a lot of veal cutlets
to match that, Vito.

634
00:34:39,728 --> 00:34:42,561
So this whole score
is like one big fancy burglary.

635
00:34:42,562 --> 00:34:43,925
Yeah.

636
00:34:43,926 --> 00:34:45,649
Does anyone else
know about this?

637
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,850
No one, just the three of us.

638
00:34:48,901 --> 00:34:50,433
What do you think, Pop?

639
00:35:01,408 --> 00:35:02,997
What do I think?

640
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,497
When you were talking
about yeast-fixing nitrogen...

641
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:11,809
The look on your face...
You're in or you're out, but no lectures.

642
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:14,395
I'm in. I'm in. I'm in.

643
00:35:15,122 --> 00:35:16,567
You're happy now, huh?

644
00:35:17,663 --> 00:35:19,100
- I'm in.
- Yeah.

645
00:35:19,269 --> 00:35:20,780
To the Gypsies of the world.

646
00:35:21,226 --> 00:35:23,553
Not a hypocritical
bone in their bodies.

647
00:35:28,109 --> 00:35:30,976
Come on. Let's pay our respects
to the grieving widow...

648
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:32,994
Before she falls flat
on her face, drunk.

649
00:35:40,095 --> 00:35:42,359
- How you doing, Jess?
- Hi, Phil.

650
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:44,299
Vito, it's been a long time.

651
00:35:50,136 --> 00:35:52,643
Well, Phil, busy, busy, busy.

652
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:55,752
It's my crowd.
Listen, these are Yves Saint Laurent.

653
00:35:55,799 --> 00:35:58,268
They're 800 a pop
in the better stores.

654
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:01,221
Fell off a truck.
I'll let them go for 200 apiece.

655
00:36:01,797 --> 00:36:03,061
Let's see here.

656
00:36:03,522 --> 00:36:05,118
You know, 38's on the left.

657
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,889
Ladies and gentlemen, we're supposed
to be closing in a little bit...

658
00:36:09,342 --> 00:36:12,698
But I think it would be a crime
to have a 10:00 last call...

659
00:36:12,752 --> 00:36:14,994
For Danny Doheny's wake...

660
00:36:15,362 --> 00:36:18,596
So closing time is extended.

661
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:20,870
Give me that back.

662
00:36:23,744 --> 00:36:25,908
Kevin, Michael...

663
00:36:26,489 --> 00:36:28,385
The song for Danny.

664
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,885
This your basic
old-fashioned Irish wake?

665
00:37:28,714 --> 00:37:29,558
Yes!

666
00:37:29,597 --> 00:37:31,134
When it's run right.

667
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,810
Between the keycard
and these cockamamie rent-a-cops...

668
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:02,689
Getting in will be a cinch.

669
00:38:02,885 --> 00:38:04,714
Come on, Vito, let's
get out of here.

670
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,365
But first we'll go
back to the motel.

671
00:38:06,366 --> 00:38:08,814
I wanna take a dry run
as soon as it gets dark.

672
00:38:19,554 --> 00:38:22,447
You know, being back in action,
it agrees with you, Vito.

673
00:38:22,448 --> 00:38:24,035
Puts a little bounce in your step.

674
00:38:24,036 --> 00:38:26,720
You're giving me some sound advice
on how to conduct my life?

675
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,872
- That's what fathers are for.
- Right.

676
00:38:29,105 --> 00:38:30,760
The bounce will stay in my step...

677
00:38:30,761 --> 00:38:32,628
As long as I get my share
don't wind up in your pocket.

678
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,800
Did I ever cheat you
out of a nickel, when?

679
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:38,415
For starters, you wanna start with the big 10
bucks I never got out of that Lionel train...

680
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:40,973
Are you still whining
about those fucking trains?

681
00:38:40,974 --> 00:38:42,470
I'll buy you a
set for Christmas.

682
00:38:42,471 --> 00:38:43,893
I'll hold my breath.

683
00:38:44,305 --> 00:38:46,857
You can carry a grudge
for 30 years.

684
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:48,589
That's the Sicilian genes.

685
00:38:49,792 --> 00:38:52,955
Now, I'm pretty sure
that the bar is over there.

686
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,591
It's in the restaurant, of course.

687
00:38:55,971 --> 00:38:57,471
Let's have a drink.

688
00:38:59,495 --> 00:39:01,026
After I shower.

689
00:39:02,443 --> 00:39:04,191
Honest work makes
honest sweat.

690
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,471
You're a bad influence.

691
00:39:06,815 --> 00:39:09,823
Now, I know this is gonna sound gross...

692
00:39:11,036 --> 00:39:13,838
But you've gotta accept
the cab fare.

693
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:16,761
I hear they're very expensive
in the suburbs.

694
00:39:18,846 --> 00:39:20,869
So I figured...

695
00:39:21,815 --> 00:39:23,714
150 ought to cover it.

696
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,997
That sounds right for the meter,
but we have to tip the driver too.

697
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:29,733
Jesus. We can't have
some hard-working refugee...

698
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:32,073
From Bangladesh going tipless.

699
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:34,948
Well...

700
00:39:35,464 --> 00:39:36,893
Will 200 cover it?

701
00:39:37,721 --> 00:39:39,456
We don't live near each other.

702
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:43,463
Separate cabs, of course.
That was understood from the get go.

703
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:47,206
- Vito, Margo and Denise.
- How you doing?

704
00:39:47,409 --> 00:39:50,991
It was, "I was champion
baton twirler of 19..."

705
00:39:50,992 --> 00:39:52,370
1983.

706
00:39:53,213 --> 00:39:55,378
I always thought that...

707
00:39:55,604 --> 00:39:58,132
Baton twirling ought to be
an Olympic event.

708
00:39:58,183 --> 00:39:59,449
What do you think, Vito?

709
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:02,128
No, I think the Chinese
would dominate in no time.

710
00:40:02,221 --> 00:40:04,863
Not against your all-American girl
they wouldn't.

711
00:40:05,557 --> 00:40:07,018
Well, I could be wrong.

712
00:40:07,604 --> 00:40:08,844
So the game is on?

713
00:40:09,104 --> 00:40:11,704
Yeah, I just have to get rid
of a previous appointment.

714
00:40:11,979 --> 00:40:13,788
Why don't you order us
another round?

715
00:40:14,045 --> 00:40:15,740
Yeah, sure.

716
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,370
Why don't you do that, Pop?

717
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:18,792
Jessie.

718
00:40:21,229 --> 00:40:24,112
What are you doing sitting here
talking to a couple of hookers?

719
00:40:24,456 --> 00:40:26,572
It's a vulgar way to refer
to a woman.

720
00:40:26,574 --> 00:40:28,325
I never brought you up
to talk like that.

721
00:40:28,326 --> 00:40:30,623
Are you gonna sit here and tell me
that those are not hookers?

722
00:40:30,624 --> 00:40:32,799
- Well, who are we to judge?
- All right.

723
00:40:34,151 --> 00:40:36,392
Look, I don't wanna put
a crimp in your style, alright?

724
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:38,924
But it's been 10 years
since I had to go home and lie...

725
00:40:38,925 --> 00:40:40,917
So I'm gonna pass. All right?

726
00:40:41,612 --> 00:40:42,705
Vito!

727
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:45,009
Vito?

728
00:40:47,402 --> 00:40:50,823
Can't you ever...
Just have a good time?

729
00:40:51,191 --> 00:40:52,143
Yeah.

730
00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:57,537
I mean, doesn't this beat
cutting up cows on 14th Street?

731
00:40:57,916 --> 00:40:59,760
Well, you know, we'll see.

732
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,990
Touch football, look at them.

733
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:22,511
Like a pack of kids playing soldiers.

734
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,382
- Did you ever play any sports, Jessie?
- Yeah.

735
00:41:25,383 --> 00:41:28,370
I ran the 100-yard dash
with two cops behind me.

736
00:41:29,138 --> 00:41:31,628
Vito thought he was an athlete though.

737
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:36,276
I remember having to stop your father
from signing up for high school football.

738
00:41:36,652 --> 00:41:38,651
Before that it was the Cub Scouts.

739
00:41:38,652 --> 00:41:40,463
Football, fucking Cub Scouts.

740
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:42,636
He had a lot of tendencies
in that direction.

741
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:46,069
Sounds like your son wanted
to be middle class.

742
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,128
He still does.

743
00:41:48,357 --> 00:41:50,073
You'll see that when
you meet his wife.

744
00:41:50,326 --> 00:41:51,239
Stop it.

745
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,823
It's where all the action is.

746
00:41:56,526 --> 00:42:00,144
I just hope the co-op market holds up
for another three years.

747
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,128
You know, Christine...

748
00:42:02,581 --> 00:42:04,187
There must be hundreds
of people out there...

749
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:07,190
Buying up insiders' rights
and selling them on the open market.

750
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,744
I mean... You must be
pretty good at it.

751
00:42:09,745 --> 00:42:11,417
How do you compete, dear?

752
00:42:13,212 --> 00:42:14,355
Well...

753
00:42:15,662 --> 00:42:17,089
You gotta have a gimmick.

754
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:18,104
Yeah?

755
00:42:18,709 --> 00:42:20,105
You do?

756
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:25,105
I have this friend named Gertrude...

757
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:28,768
And she works at Sloan-Kettering
Hospital in admissions.

758
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:32,313
And every time there's a new patient
with one of the cancers...

759
00:42:32,378 --> 00:42:34,144
That nothing can be done for...

760
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,667
If they live in Manhattan,
I check it out.

761
00:42:37,378 --> 00:42:40,206
While these people live in buildings
that have gone co-op...

762
00:42:40,253 --> 00:42:41,557
And they haven't bought...

763
00:42:42,245 --> 00:42:46,042
You can buy occupied apartments
at insider prices in those buildings.

764
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:49,961
But the problem is, the tenant's likely
to stay there for 20 years. Right?

765
00:42:49,962 --> 00:42:50,986
Yeah. Right.

766
00:42:51,224 --> 00:42:52,151
Well...

767
00:42:52,652 --> 00:42:56,566
Gertrude and I snap up an apartment
that will be vacant in six months.

768
00:42:57,593 --> 00:42:59,902
At which point,
we double our investment.

769
00:43:04,309 --> 00:43:07,628
We are sitting on seven prime
Manhattan apartments...

770
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:09,753
And every tenant terminal.

771
00:43:19,124 --> 00:43:21,164
If I were you and Gertrude,
I would sincerely hope...

772
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:23,167
That God does not have
a sense of humor.

773
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:28,885
Well...

774
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,107
The apartment
would just revert back...

775
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:33,128
To the original building owner.

776
00:43:33,222 --> 00:43:35,269
What's the difference
who turns the profit?

777
00:43:35,418 --> 00:43:39,411
The difference is, you're mucking around
in other people's misery.

778
00:43:39,846 --> 00:43:41,917
When you rob someone legally...

779
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:45,010
Without risk, without sticking
your neck out...

780
00:43:45,245 --> 00:43:46,612
That's immoral.

781
00:43:47,816 --> 00:43:50,176
Where did you find
this fucking parasite?

782
00:43:52,944 --> 00:43:54,536
Parasite?

783
00:43:57,410 --> 00:43:58,950
Yeah, it's...

784
00:43:59,807 --> 00:44:01,471
It's like a... Leech.

785
00:44:01,799 --> 00:44:02,872
Did you hear that, Adam?

786
00:44:02,911 --> 00:44:06,299
Your grandfather feels that breaking the law
would make Christine here more moral.

787
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,339
It would.

788
00:44:07,365 --> 00:44:08,442
Like most people, Elaine...

789
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,780
You confuse what's moral
with what's legal.

790
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:14,597
No. Like most people, I recognize
that in a reasonably just society...

791
00:44:14,598 --> 00:44:17,820
"A reasonably just society."
Well, tell me when you find one.

792
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:21,157
Adam, you agree with your paternal grandfather
that legality means nothing?

793
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:24,754
Which means that you can go blithely
through life doing just as you please.

794
00:44:25,326 --> 00:44:27,221
My "paternal" grandfather?

795
00:44:27,362 --> 00:44:29,345
Yeah, he's a defendant
in this case.

796
00:44:29,346 --> 00:44:31,895
You still haven't answered, Adam.
He's your guest.

797
00:44:32,937 --> 00:44:34,526
Well, I came here to eat.

798
00:44:34,757 --> 00:44:36,848
Come on, hey!
More meat.

799
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:42,448
You wanna make a
fight over this?

800
00:44:42,449 --> 00:44:44,886
I don't get it Vito, you should
have given me more support.

801
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:48,580
No, you don't come on like a parent
with Adam's idol sitting at the table.

802
00:44:48,581 --> 00:44:50,653
Why are you such a dishrag
with Adam?

803
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:53,215
We try and try to show him
who Christine really is...

804
00:44:53,216 --> 00:44:55,517
- And Jessie does it in two minutes.
- Fine.

805
00:44:55,518 --> 00:44:57,708
You see how he looks up to Jessie.

806
00:44:57,709 --> 00:45:00,721
You, better than anyone, should know
how destructive that can be.

807
00:45:01,249 --> 00:45:02,667
Take a stand, Vito.

808
00:45:09,867 --> 00:45:11,808
What do you think Adam
is going to do with himself?

809
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:15,211
It will break my heart if he doesn't
go back and get his master's.

810
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,647
- So tell him.
- He's 23 years old, Elaine.

811
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:20,596
It used to be,
"He's 15 years old, Elaine."

812
00:45:25,096 --> 00:45:29,199
Attention, shoppers. Socket wrench sets
are on sale in aisle 26.

813
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,572
These are 55-piece sets
complete with ratcheting carrier.

814
00:45:42,826 --> 00:45:45,993
Pop, you sure all this stuff isn't overkill?
I have a keycard.

815
00:45:46,517 --> 00:45:48,635
Do you know what you'll find
when you go in there?

816
00:45:48,696 --> 00:45:52,440
Whatever we find inside, just leave it
to your old man to get us through.

817
00:45:52,494 --> 00:45:53,557
Okay?

818
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:57,135
Hey, Vito. Tell him
the Peewee Grogan story.

819
00:45:57,186 --> 00:45:59,994
Please, we can do without
the Peewee Grogan story, alright?

820
00:46:00,248 --> 00:46:02,463
Your father was 17 or 18.

821
00:46:02,522 --> 00:46:05,666
Peewee was a couple of years older.

822
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:08,428
He was a tough little thief
from 9th Avenue.

823
00:46:08,489 --> 00:46:11,458
Couple of inches shorter
and he'd have wound up in the circus.

824
00:46:11,625 --> 00:46:15,166
Used to say, in a street fight, he could
hit you with overhand left to the balls.

825
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:19,609
The three of us went after
a load of French perfume.

826
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:23,295
- It was sitting in a warehouse out in...
- Bush terminal.

827
00:46:23,296 --> 00:46:24,291
Right.

828
00:46:24,727 --> 00:46:27,791
God. We stripped Peewee naked.

829
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:31,103
We smeared him from head to foot
with Vaseline.

830
00:46:31,819 --> 00:46:36,424
Now, this kid squeezed through
25 feet of air-conditioning duct.

831
00:46:36,787 --> 00:46:38,619
And when he opened the door for us...

832
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:40,408
He was dripping blood.

833
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:44,307
Hundreds of little gashes
where he'd ripped himself to shreds...

834
00:46:44,349 --> 00:46:46,431
On the heads of the nails
going through.

835
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:50,627
- Vito, that dwarf had heart.
- Yeah, that he did.

836
00:46:50,884 --> 00:46:53,648
- We worked for six hours.
- No, five and a half.

837
00:46:53,828 --> 00:46:55,796
- Six.
- Five and a half.

838
00:46:55,947 --> 00:46:57,892
On an inside steel door...

839
00:46:58,429 --> 00:47:01,660
With 25 grand of French perfume
on the other side.

840
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:05,788
We took turns with a sledgehammer.
We battered it. We hammered it.

841
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:09,346
We tried everything.
We even tried to cry our way through.

842
00:47:10,291 --> 00:47:13,424
- Vito, am I exaggerating?
- Just finish the story, Pop.

843
00:47:14,316 --> 00:47:18,213
Finally, Peewee knelt down
and prayed.

844
00:47:18,367 --> 00:47:21,119
He swore this was gonna be
his last burglary...

845
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,260
If only God would let us open
that fucking door.

846
00:47:25,494 --> 00:47:29,275
You see, what the job called for
was a three-foot pry bar.

847
00:47:30,329 --> 00:47:31,900
Your old man hadn't brought one.

848
00:47:33,432 --> 00:47:35,299
So we left empty-handed.

849
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:37,658
Peewee left a pint of blood behind...

850
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:40,479
And Vito swore he'd never go
on another job...

851
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:42,237
Under-equipped.

852
00:47:42,345 --> 00:47:45,193
I think your grandpa's moral
is to be prepared like a Boy Scout.

853
00:47:45,194 --> 00:47:47,498
But what he's forgetting
to tell you is that it was him...

854
00:47:47,499 --> 00:47:49,673
That should have brought
the pry bar.

855
00:47:49,674 --> 00:47:53,889
- Bullshit. The tools were your end.
- The tools were my end? I beg to differ.

856
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:55,546
Whatever happened
to Peewee Grogan?

857
00:47:55,823 --> 00:47:56,736
Peewee?

858
00:47:56,737 --> 00:47:59,813
Well, he wound up doing
15 to 30 as an habitual.

859
00:48:00,154 --> 00:48:01,955
And that's tough time for a guy...

860
00:48:02,289 --> 00:48:03,523
4-foot-2.

861
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:05,921
You're really an asshole
sometimes, you know?

862
00:48:05,922 --> 00:48:07,828
You really are a fucking asshole.

863
00:48:16,858 --> 00:48:20,207
What would you do for sex
if I were gone for a couple of years?

864
00:48:20,623 --> 00:48:22,662
You planning on
joining the Navy?

865
00:48:22,688 --> 00:48:24,576
No, you know, it's a
hypothetical question.

866
00:48:24,606 --> 00:48:28,114
Suppose, God forbid,
I got put in prison for two or three years.

867
00:48:28,808 --> 00:48:30,356
What would you do for sex?

868
00:48:31,878 --> 00:48:34,809
- I hadn't really thought about it.
- Yeah, well...

869
00:48:34,883 --> 00:48:38,614
But now that you mention it,
there is this one big good-looking kid...

870
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:41,098
Works the vegetable counter
in Grand Union.

871
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:42,394
He's crazy about me.

872
00:48:42,395 --> 00:48:43,629
Oh, yeah?

873
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,887
You been overreaching
on your tax-evasion schemes?

874
00:48:51,924 --> 00:48:56,911
I'll bet the vegetable kid in Grand Union
doesn't really love you.

875
00:49:00,254 --> 00:49:04,230
Not gonna start moralizing, are you,
robbing Uncle Sam for undeclared cash?

876
00:49:04,238 --> 00:49:06,076
No, I was just talking.

877
00:49:06,102 --> 00:49:08,185
Don't go so far they
really lock you up.

878
00:49:09,352 --> 00:49:11,481
We're not as tough as we
used to be.

879
00:49:14,373 --> 00:49:17,035
I waited 27 months to marry you, Vito.

880
00:49:17,224 --> 00:49:21,036
I rode on a bus six hours every Saturday
and never missed a visit.

881
00:49:21,843 --> 00:49:23,606
We were a couple of kids then.

882
00:49:24,626 --> 00:49:26,950
But I couldn't take it
if you went away now.

883
00:49:28,922 --> 00:49:31,270
Besides, how would you be able
to face Adam?

884
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:51,161
All right. All right. All right.

885
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:54,262
Everything's the same.
One security guard.

886
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:57,126
- I told you this was gonna be a snap.
- Yeah?

887
00:49:57,127 --> 00:50:00,127
- He's armed?
- His holster was on the back of the chair.

888
00:50:00,128 --> 00:50:03,746
And he's sitting there watching TV
with his shoes off.

889
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,457
Guard had a gun?

890
00:50:06,916 --> 00:50:08,426
Yeah, what did you expect?

891
00:50:08,982 --> 00:50:13,394
- I didn't really think about it.
- Well, welcome to the real world.

892
00:50:13,442 --> 00:50:16,286
Relax. He's got one,
we'll have three.

893
00:50:16,622 --> 00:50:20,098
- Two. He doesn't carry a gun.
- I don't wanna anybody carrying a gun.

894
00:50:20,145 --> 00:50:23,770
What you think, they'll mail us the
what do you call them? The plasmids?

895
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:26,842
If you don't wanna
do this thing, say so.

896
00:50:26,845 --> 00:50:29,427
Vito, you're doing
what you always do...

897
00:50:29,481 --> 00:50:31,358
You're treating him like a kid.

898
00:50:31,384 --> 00:50:33,326
Adam should go in there packing.

899
00:50:33,355 --> 00:50:36,121
He's never done it, Jessie.
He does not carry.

900
00:50:36,122 --> 00:50:37,139
We vote!

901
00:50:37,165 --> 00:50:39,097
We don't vote.
He doesn't carry!

902
00:50:39,098 --> 00:50:41,168
If Adam carries, I walk.

903
00:51:11,877 --> 00:51:13,317
Close the lid.

904
00:51:47,474 --> 00:51:50,667
- Wait. Didn't you bring any gloves?
- No.

905
00:51:55,675 --> 00:51:58,208
Put that on.
Come on, come on, come on!

906
00:52:02,814 --> 00:52:03,938
Say when.

907
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:43,802
- All right?
- Okay.

908
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,482
Go ahead.

909
00:52:51,723 --> 00:52:53,497
Sit tight. I'll check out the guard.

910
00:52:53,609 --> 00:52:55,443
Pull this. I can't see.

911
00:53:01,584 --> 00:53:04,527
This is why I hated
putting on your snowsuit.

912
00:53:11,287 --> 00:53:13,583
I was on much tougher scores
than this at your age.

913
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:16,580
All I saw out of them
was a ham sandwich.

914
00:53:16,606 --> 00:53:18,108
You're starting at the top.

915
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,134
Yeah, that's America.

916
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,007
Every generation does
a little bit better.

917
00:53:47,178 --> 00:53:48,640
What if he's out
making rounds?

918
00:53:48,666 --> 00:53:50,217
He's snoozing somewhere.

919
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:53,333
The work ethic in America
is dead and buried.

920
00:53:54,013 --> 00:53:55,450
- Let's do it.
- Here.

921
00:54:35,052 --> 00:54:36,361
Freeze!

922
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:39,792
Where the hell is he?

923
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:46,753
He could be off taking a leak
or making rounds.

924
00:54:47,996 --> 00:54:49,636
Then we sit tight and wait for him.

925
00:54:53,703 --> 00:54:55,388
Did you close the hall doors?

926
00:54:55,779 --> 00:54:56,696
I think so.

927
00:54:56,697 --> 00:54:57,467
No.

928
00:54:57,990 --> 00:54:59,175
You can't think so.

929
00:54:59,222 --> 00:55:02,487
You're sure you did or you're sure
you didn't or you don't know.

930
00:55:03,254 --> 00:55:04,612
I don't know.

931
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:07,065
If the guard sees an open door,
it's all over.

932
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:09,638
I'll take this corridor.
You take that one.

933
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:12,370
Adam, stay here in case
he's on his way back with a six-pack.

934
00:55:12,554 --> 00:55:15,276
Wait. What does he do
if the guard walks in?

935
00:55:18,289 --> 00:55:19,886
So let him take a piece.

936
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:25,005
No.

937
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:29,350
You got a say in
this too, you know.

938
00:55:29,376 --> 00:55:30,614
No, he doesn't.

939
00:55:32,689 --> 00:55:33,858
Move and I'll kill you.

940
00:55:34,191 --> 00:55:35,146
Come here.

941
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:42,467
Put your hands together.

942
00:55:50,316 --> 00:55:53,410
I'm marking your outline on the floor
with a piece of chalk.

943
00:55:53,523 --> 00:55:56,424
Now, when we get back,
any part of you outside that line...

944
00:55:56,459 --> 00:55:58,928
Gets shot away. D'you follow?

945
00:57:02,091 --> 00:57:04,614
- I hope he knows where he's going.
- It's his show.

946
00:57:46,053 --> 00:57:48,493
Did we bust into the wrong place,
for chrissakes?

947
00:57:48,671 --> 00:57:50,866
- He knows what he's doing.
- Yeah.

948
00:58:37,586 --> 00:58:38,848
This is it.

949
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:20,245
We're taking too long.

950
00:59:27,342 --> 00:59:28,554
This is odd.

951
00:59:29,305 --> 00:59:30,390
What?

952
00:59:32,445 --> 00:59:34,265
I'd like to get the hell out of here.

953
00:59:46,055 --> 00:59:47,109
Pop?

954
01:00:11,856 --> 01:00:13,289
That's the whole show?

955
01:00:13,349 --> 01:00:16,364
Unless you wanna tell us
the Peewee Grogan story again.

956
01:00:45,468 --> 01:00:46,585
Go!

957
01:00:49,015 --> 01:00:50,073
What about the guard?

958
01:00:50,117 --> 01:00:51,914
The longer he thinks we're here,
the better.

959
01:01:04,637 --> 01:01:06,327
No, Jessie, wait. Wait.

960
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:10,757
Go.

961
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:20,637
- Hey!
- What?

962
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:23,011
Do either of you have the logbook?

963
01:01:23,686 --> 01:01:25,292
- No.
- Shit!

964
01:01:25,454 --> 01:01:26,648
We got the tubes.

965
01:01:26,817 --> 01:01:28,808
They're paying us for
the plasmides and the logbook.

966
01:01:28,839 --> 01:01:30,035
You stay, I'll go back.

967
01:01:30,058 --> 01:01:32,058
There's a stack of logbooks
in that desk.

968
01:01:32,103 --> 01:01:34,409
Easy, easy, you just
tell me which one.

969
01:01:34,456 --> 01:01:36,496
I'm the gifted Westinghouse Scholar.
I'll get it.

970
01:01:36,565 --> 01:01:38,698
- No, no, Adam, wait a minute. Adam!
- Hey!

971
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:42,198
- Let's get these in the car.
- No, I'll wait here.

972
01:01:42,237 --> 01:01:45,136
Hey! We gotta be ready to roll
when he gets out. Now come on.

973
01:02:55,422 --> 01:02:56,632
You okay?

974
01:02:57,713 --> 01:03:01,008
Okay, we'll be out in
about a half an hour.

975
01:03:18,890 --> 01:03:19,844
Oh, God!

976
01:03:20,836 --> 01:03:22,025
God!

977
01:03:46,416 --> 01:03:47,931
You can't do anything
out there.

978
01:03:48,704 --> 01:03:51,376
Just be ready to gun this
fucking thing if the kid makes it.

979
01:03:51,377 --> 01:03:52,501
If the...?

980
01:04:40,516 --> 01:04:42,039
Freeze!

981
01:04:57,489 --> 01:04:58,797
Who's with you?

982
01:05:01,061 --> 01:05:02,499
There's two of them.

983
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:04,617
They're still in the building.

984
01:05:21,323 --> 01:05:22,722
Move out, Vito.

985
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:30,455
No lights.

986
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:32,783
Glide.

987
01:05:47,546 --> 01:05:48,596
Stop.

988
01:05:55,990 --> 01:05:57,423
Let's go, Vito.

989
01:05:57,557 --> 01:05:58,573
Drive.

990
01:06:27,929 --> 01:06:29,014
Vito?

991
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,186
Yeah.

992
01:06:33,095 --> 01:06:34,241
What time is it?

993
01:06:37,266 --> 01:06:39,952
About... About 3:00.

994
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:48,351
How'd you do?

995
01:06:48,572 --> 01:06:50,366
I lost about 60 bucks.

996
01:06:56,118 --> 01:06:58,088
I tried getting Adam earlier.

997
01:07:00,574 --> 01:07:02,525
Oh, yeah? What for?

998
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:04,626
I was thinking...

999
01:07:04,676 --> 01:07:07,705
The other day at dinner I came
down on him a little too hard.

1000
01:07:08,285 --> 01:07:09,541
I want to tell him that.

1001
01:07:11,066 --> 01:07:13,346
I'll try getting him again tomorrow.

1002
01:07:15,971 --> 01:07:17,041
He...

1003
01:07:18,032 --> 01:07:21,181
He didn't tell you? He
went up to... Cambridge...

1004
01:07:22,205 --> 01:07:23,281
For a few days.

1005
01:07:23,282 --> 01:07:25,509
He wanted to see
some college friends.

1006
01:07:27,052 --> 01:07:28,502
It's a glimmer of hope.

1007
01:07:30,067 --> 01:07:31,900
Yeah, yeah.

1008
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:39,252
I know you don't wanna hear this, but Adam
leaving school isn't the end of the world.

1009
01:07:39,294 --> 01:07:41,421
He's still growing up.
And you know what?

1010
01:07:41,666 --> 01:07:44,275
He'll outgrow Jessie too.
He'll see through him.

1011
01:07:46,652 --> 01:07:48,103
He's your son, Vito.

1012
01:07:50,105 --> 01:07:51,580
You'll see.

1013
01:07:56,678 --> 01:07:58,096
Am I wrong?

1014
01:08:14,329 --> 01:08:15,658
No...

1015
01:08:17,326 --> 01:08:18,814
I'm sure you're right.

1016
01:08:22,471 --> 01:08:25,728
You're depressed.
You lost more than 60 bucks.

1017
01:08:27,376 --> 01:08:28,635
Yeah.

1018
01:08:33,793 --> 01:08:36,674
Look, I got a boy just
about your age.

1019
01:08:38,654 --> 01:08:40,728
What are you 20, 21?

1020
01:08:41,486 --> 01:08:43,783
My name is Adam McQuade.
I'm homeless.

1021
01:08:43,821 --> 01:08:45,665
I'm waiting for my lawyer to get here.

1022
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:49,314
Your buddies left you there.

1023
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:52,096
My name is Adam McQuade.

1024
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:59,799
When you been up in Attica 10 years,
surrounded by psychotics...

1025
01:09:01,207 --> 01:09:04,173
You're gonna wish you'd taken
a little fatherly advice.

1026
01:09:33,075 --> 01:09:35,239
Hey, you're nervous. I'll drive.

1027
01:09:39,558 --> 01:09:41,372
Well, it's going to be expensive.

1028
01:09:42,692 --> 01:09:44,085
We're not rich people.

1029
01:09:44,086 --> 01:09:47,089
Your attorney should've recommended
a lawyer more suited to your pocket.

1030
01:09:47,090 --> 01:09:48,576
No one's crying poverty here.

1031
01:09:48,577 --> 01:09:50,599
All I'm saying is,
this is family money.

1032
01:09:51,159 --> 01:09:55,192
Money I managed to squirrel away
after 50 years hard work.

1033
01:09:55,193 --> 01:09:59,113
You saw Adam. Can we drop the subject
of money and hear how he is for one minut?

1034
01:09:59,114 --> 01:10:00,835
No, we can't. I bill for time.

1035
01:10:00,836 --> 01:10:03,823
Mine, the lawyers on my staff,
a couple of paralegals.

1036
01:10:03,824 --> 01:10:05,887
My office time is 150 an hour.

1037
01:10:06,098 --> 01:10:09,049
My court time, and no one but me
will ever be in a courtroom...

1038
01:10:09,050 --> 01:10:10,606
Is 1,500 per day.

1039
01:10:11,973 --> 01:10:13,347
Fifteen hundred?!

1040
01:10:13,348 --> 01:10:16,387
That's where my talent runs rampant,
and I charge accordingly.

1041
01:10:17,019 --> 01:10:18,680
Would you sit down, please?

1042
01:10:22,571 --> 01:10:24,713
Depending on whether we strike a deal
or go to trial...

1043
01:10:24,722 --> 01:10:26,593
You're looking at a low 20,000...

1044
01:10:26,594 --> 01:10:28,735
And it could run nicely to 75,

1045
01:10:29,104 --> 01:10:30,846
Exclusive of appeals.

1046
01:10:31,299 --> 01:10:34,935
Now, If the trial looks hopeless,
we'll be waiting for a guilty verdict...

1047
01:10:34,936 --> 01:10:37,127
And orchestrating everything
toward an appeal...

1048
01:10:37,174 --> 01:10:39,040
A real possibility, I might add.

1049
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:41,158
A guilty verdict is
a real possibility?

1050
01:10:41,197 --> 01:10:42,660
That's why there's no bail.

1051
01:10:43,145 --> 01:10:47,431
Running at the scene. He also refuses
to divulge the name of his partners.

1052
01:10:47,603 --> 01:10:49,197
The judge won't be lenient.

1053
01:10:49,863 --> 01:10:54,075
I must say, for a middle-class boy, your
son's values seem a bit misdirected.

1054
01:10:54,182 --> 01:10:57,494
My grandson's not middle class
and never has been.

1055
01:10:58,258 --> 01:11:01,362
The D.A.'s anxious to strike a deal.
That's a positive.

1056
01:11:01,487 --> 01:11:04,497
The company isn't screaming
for blood, which is unusual.

1057
01:11:04,675 --> 01:11:06,142
Why aren't they screaming for blood?

1058
01:11:06,165 --> 01:11:08,111
They don't want to put Adam
on the cross.

1059
01:11:08,775 --> 01:11:12,477
The bottom line is if Adam will deliver
his partners and the plasmids...

1060
01:11:12,478 --> 01:11:15,158
They're talking minimum jail time,
maybe six months.

1061
01:11:15,181 --> 01:11:19,502
Mind you, that's for openers. They'll go
for zero jail time at the drop of a hat.

1062
01:11:19,885 --> 01:11:22,217
- I see.
- They wanna make a rat out of him.

1063
01:11:22,247 --> 01:11:24,511
Hey, mister, he's your grandson.

1064
01:11:24,823 --> 01:11:27,383
- I was talking to him.
- I can hear it.

1065
01:11:27,656 --> 01:11:30,635
Please. What if Adam holds out,
gives no one up...

1066
01:11:30,681 --> 01:11:33,525
- Won't say where the plasmids are?
- They'll crucify him.

1067
01:11:33,695 --> 01:11:38,916
You can't stand in front of a judge in
the United States and say, "Fuck you."

1068
01:11:38,967 --> 01:11:40,260
They won't tolerate it.

1069
01:11:41,205 --> 01:11:42,803
What does crucify mean?

1070
01:11:42,804 --> 01:11:46,865
When they finish adding burglary-one
charges, assaulting the guards...

1071
01:11:47,049 --> 01:11:50,212
You're looking at two
14-year sentences, consecutive...

1072
01:11:50,378 --> 01:11:51,811
Which the judge is free to do.

1073
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:56,178
I would appeal it on the ground that both
charges stem from the same crime...

1074
01:11:56,578 --> 01:11:59,291
But I wouldn't hold my breath
until it's overturned.

1075
01:11:59,588 --> 01:12:00,893
If your son...

1076
01:12:01,439 --> 01:12:03,603
And your grandson, Mr. McMullen...

1077
01:12:03,825 --> 01:12:08,424
Behaves perfectly, tutors his fellow
cons with remedial-reading problems...

1078
01:12:08,663 --> 01:12:10,853
He could be out in 15 years,...

1079
01:12:11,455 --> 01:12:13,807
A bit shy of his 40th birthday.

1080
01:12:18,832 --> 01:12:20,424
We need a few minutes.

1081
01:12:20,585 --> 01:12:21,916
Come on.

1082
01:12:22,110 --> 01:12:24,544
Fifteen years! Did you hear
what she said?

1083
01:12:24,713 --> 01:12:28,227
We take the logbook and the
plasmids, and we turn ourselves in.

1084
01:12:28,228 --> 01:12:29,346
Woa, woa, woa!

1085
01:12:29,373 --> 01:12:31,128
We take this step by step.

1086
01:12:31,129 --> 01:12:33,645
Oh, fuck that! I've been through
that step by step....

1087
01:12:33,788 --> 01:12:37,280
It just means Jessie McMullen first!
That's my kid in there, man.

1088
01:12:37,361 --> 01:12:40,635
Adam can manage 48 hours
in a suburban jail.

1089
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:45,423
Adam will not spend one more
fucking hour in any fucking jail!

1090
01:12:45,458 --> 01:12:48,673
- Didn't you hear her? Did you fucking listen?
- Keep your voice down.

1091
01:12:48,703 --> 01:12:50,931
You are not listening to me.
Listen to me!

1092
01:12:50,972 --> 01:12:53,830
You don't fucking listen
to what I say!

1093
01:13:01,429 --> 01:13:05,260
- That's you... Hey.
- What?

1094
01:13:10,801 --> 01:13:13,147
- Adam's my grandson.
- Yeah.

1095
01:13:13,812 --> 01:13:16,533
- Would I hurt him?
- I don't know. Would you, Jessie?

1096
01:13:17,832 --> 01:13:19,533
- I'll tell you what.
- What?

1097
01:13:22,131 --> 01:13:24,077
- Hold still.
- I cut myself shaving.

1098
01:13:29,156 --> 01:13:30,713
You go visit him...

1099
01:13:31,174 --> 01:13:33,558
And I'll settle up with
this fucking shyster.

1100
01:13:39,254 --> 01:13:41,689
No, no. I'll settle
with the fucking shyster.

1101
01:13:41,690 --> 01:13:43,994
I'll settle with that fucking...
Don't you worry.

1102
01:13:44,777 --> 01:13:47,744
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

1103
01:14:06,119 --> 01:14:08,884
Hey! Did you see a white Caddy here?
A white Fleetwood?

1104
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:11,142
Yeah, some old guy just drove it out.

1105
01:14:14,393 --> 01:14:16,509
Where do you get
a taxi around here?

1106
01:14:16,558 --> 01:14:18,583
- Not around here.
- I need a fucking taxi.

1107
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:21,194
Get me a fucking taxi! Taxi!

1108
01:14:21,830 --> 01:14:22,885
How you doing?

1109
01:14:23,112 --> 01:14:23,933
I'm okay.

1110
01:14:24,933 --> 01:14:26,744
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1111
01:14:28,496 --> 01:14:30,225
If things don't improve, Adam...

1112
01:14:30,445 --> 01:14:33,676
Your father will want us
to turn ourselves in with the stuff.

1113
01:14:33,842 --> 01:14:35,033
That's bullshit.

1114
01:14:36,347 --> 01:14:37,609
It means you walk.

1115
01:14:38,179 --> 01:14:42,658
Yeah, the lawyer gave me
that... 15 years in prison spiel too.

1116
01:14:42,684 --> 01:14:44,392
She's just pumping her fee up.

1117
01:14:45,596 --> 01:14:47,596
I won't do more than a year, tops.

1118
01:14:48,971 --> 01:14:50,330
I can do that.

1119
01:14:51,025 --> 01:14:52,507
You did it. Dad did it.

1120
01:14:52,580 --> 01:14:54,878
He just doesn't have the
confidence in me to do it.

1121
01:14:55,142 --> 01:14:56,940
Don't kid yourself
it's gonna be easy.

1122
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:01,221
Somebody once told me it builds
character...

1123
01:15:01,315 --> 01:15:02,698
Lke a hitch in the Army.

1124
01:15:03,471 --> 01:15:05,109
You still have the plasmids?

1125
01:15:06,374 --> 01:15:07,728
Yeah, on ice.

1126
01:15:07,876 --> 01:15:09,707
- And the logbook?
- Yeah.

1127
01:15:09,878 --> 01:15:13,179
Well, then Jimmy Chiu will still pay
us the million bucks.

1128
01:15:14,209 --> 01:15:16,858
We spend a 100,000 on my defense...

1129
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:19,984
And we still get to keep
300,000 apiece.

1130
01:15:23,570 --> 01:15:25,163
You're a McMullen.

1131
01:15:41,609 --> 01:15:42,976
Adam McMullen.

1132
01:15:43,445 --> 01:15:44,625
You his lawyer?

1133
01:15:44,831 --> 01:15:45,845
I'm his father.

1134
01:15:47,227 --> 01:15:49,209
One visitor a day.
He's already had one.

1135
01:15:50,452 --> 01:15:51,491
Who?

1136
01:15:53,688 --> 01:15:55,124
Jessie McMullen.

1137
01:16:06,761 --> 01:16:09,452
Jessie, if you're in there,
open the fucking door!

1138
01:16:35,330 --> 01:16:36,406
Is he here?

1139
01:16:36,929 --> 01:16:39,064
Is that son of a bitch here?
Don't lie to me!

1140
01:16:39,065 --> 01:16:40,960
You're gonna foot the bill for
that fucking useless chain!

1141
01:16:41,011 --> 01:16:42,148
Is he here?

1142
01:16:43,938 --> 01:16:45,781
You're an emotional bunch,
you McMullens.

1143
01:16:48,046 --> 01:16:49,565
I didn't mean to do that.

1144
01:16:49,566 --> 01:16:51,246
You could have asked to come in.

1145
01:16:51,247 --> 01:16:53,585
What the hell is wrong
with your family?

1146
01:16:56,050 --> 01:16:58,554
What's wrong with my family
is my lunatic father.

1147
01:17:01,476 --> 01:17:02,452
Here.

1148
01:17:07,717 --> 01:17:09,548
You don't seem surprised to see me.

1149
01:17:09,798 --> 01:17:11,946
Well, I try to take
life as it comes.

1150
01:17:11,968 --> 01:17:13,202
Yeah?

1151
01:17:17,071 --> 01:17:18,554
What are you
supposed to tell me?

1152
01:17:22,098 --> 01:17:23,670
He tell you I might show up?

1153
01:17:25,869 --> 01:17:26,866
Yeah.

1154
01:17:27,816 --> 01:17:29,202
He tell you what for?

1155
01:17:30,877 --> 01:17:33,515
- He tell you what for?
- Yes, he said you two had a falling out.

1156
01:17:33,523 --> 01:17:37,179
A falling out? That fuck calls
this a "falling out"?

1157
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:39,062
I take it he understated the case.

1158
01:17:40,895 --> 01:17:42,382
What are you supposed to tell me?

1159
01:17:42,764 --> 01:17:45,281
- That he's out of town, which he is.
- Yeah? Yeah.

1160
01:17:45,667 --> 01:17:48,609
And that what you're looking for
isn't here, which it isn't.

1161
01:17:49,504 --> 01:17:50,937
And it's not at his place.

1162
01:17:51,105 --> 01:17:53,577
He said you'd be smart enough
to know that without asking.

1163
01:18:19,035 --> 01:18:21,066
What the hell are
you looking for Vito?

1164
01:18:21,092 --> 01:18:22,355
Don't worry about it.

1165
01:18:27,659 --> 01:18:29,206
What do you mean,
what am I looking for?

1166
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:31,730
Do you think it would be
like your father to tell me?

1167
01:18:39,129 --> 01:18:43,555
Jessie and me and Adam
did a fancy burglary.

1168
01:18:43,995 --> 01:18:47,548
We got goods worth a ton of money,
and Adam got dropped coming out.

1169
01:18:49,363 --> 01:18:50,415
My son...

1170
01:18:51,012 --> 01:18:53,884
Jessie's grandson, is now sitting
up in Nassau County...

1171
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:55,680
Looking at 15 years behind...

1172
01:18:58,587 --> 01:19:00,024
Behind bars.

1173
01:19:00,168 --> 01:19:01,637
15 years in a cage.

1174
01:19:04,303 --> 01:19:05,735
If the goods are returned...

1175
01:19:06,478 --> 01:19:07,548
And...

1176
01:19:08,286 --> 01:19:09,977
Me and Jessie...

1177
01:19:12,005 --> 01:19:13,954
Turn ourselves in, Adam walks.

1178
01:19:15,955 --> 01:19:17,696
But while my back was turned...

1179
01:19:19,294 --> 01:19:21,306
Jessie made off with the goods.

1180
01:19:25,967 --> 01:19:27,266
I don't believe you.

1181
01:19:28,688 --> 01:19:30,284
You know, I've been
around thieves.

1182
01:19:30,285 --> 01:19:31,947
That's how I came
upon your father.

1183
01:19:33,781 --> 01:19:36,810
I married one of the better
counterfeiters on the East Coast.

1184
01:19:36,811 --> 01:19:39,880
I know the score, okay?
I'm a knockaround girl.

1185
01:19:39,881 --> 01:19:44,051
You and Jessie wanna rob, go ahead,
but how could you take Adam along?

1186
01:19:44,052 --> 01:19:45,657
I went along to...

1187
01:19:46,514 --> 01:19:47,680
To look out for him.

1188
01:19:47,923 --> 01:19:49,493
Bullshit.

1189
01:19:50,359 --> 01:19:53,134
You enjoyed every minute of it.
All you guys do.

1190
01:19:58,996 --> 01:20:00,634
Why not turn yourself in?

1191
01:20:07,629 --> 01:20:09,321
Without the goods, it's useless.

1192
01:20:32,265 --> 01:20:33,903
Jesus, thank you.

1193
01:20:46,399 --> 01:20:50,680
Why don't you just tell Jessie that I,
you know, smacked you around, okay?

1194
01:20:52,220 --> 01:20:55,039
I'll tell him to go cut his fucking wrists.

1195
01:20:55,690 --> 01:20:58,252
Get that kid out of jail, Vito.
I'll take care of myself.

1196
01:20:58,253 --> 01:20:59,555
I'm trying.

1197
01:21:02,101 --> 01:21:03,625
- I'll get it.
- Hello.

1198
01:21:03,765 --> 01:21:05,164
Just a moment.

1199
01:21:05,843 --> 01:21:07,750
It's for you. It's a woman.

1200
01:21:08,727 --> 01:21:09,765
Hello.

1201
01:21:09,791 --> 01:21:11,250
You start playing
straight with me Mr...

1202
01:21:11,288 --> 01:21:13,133
Or your son's gonna rot in jail.

1203
01:21:13,843 --> 01:21:14,787
What?

1204
01:21:14,788 --> 01:21:15,751
Water!

1205
01:21:15,777 --> 01:21:18,961
You gave me eight vials of tap water.

1206
01:21:20,968 --> 01:21:22,440
What are you saying?

1207
01:21:22,441 --> 01:21:26,207
I said, you gave me
eight vials of tap water!

1208
01:21:31,861 --> 01:21:32,978
What's wrong?

1209
01:21:33,364 --> 01:21:34,528
Who was that?

1210
01:21:34,529 --> 01:21:35,883
It's...

1211
01:21:37,329 --> 01:21:39,058
It's about Adam...

1212
01:21:39,317 --> 01:21:41,148
- Oh, God.
- No, no, he's not hurt.

1213
01:21:41,202 --> 01:21:42,219
He's...

1214
01:21:46,474 --> 01:21:47,625
He's been arrested.

1215
01:21:48,376 --> 01:21:49,666
A burglary...

1216
01:21:51,813 --> 01:21:53,672
Upstate. It's...

1217
01:21:54,792 --> 01:21:56,711
- A burglary?
- Well, it's pretty serious.

1218
01:21:58,052 --> 01:21:59,813
How did Adam get...?

1219
01:22:00,653 --> 01:22:03,524
What is Adam doing involved
in a burglary, Vito?

1220
01:22:03,766 --> 01:22:05,071
How did he...?

1221
01:22:07,303 --> 01:22:09,032
Jessie was involved in it.

1222
01:22:11,359 --> 01:22:12,406
Jessie.

1223
01:22:20,374 --> 01:22:21,771
I'm gonna kill him.

1224
01:22:23,201 --> 01:22:25,101
I wanna kill that son of a bitch,
you know.

1225
01:22:28,624 --> 01:22:29,873
I was part of it too.

1226
01:22:33,354 --> 01:22:35,481
I went along to look out for Adam.

1227
01:22:36,414 --> 01:22:37,881
But he would have gone anyway...

1228
01:22:38,959 --> 01:22:42,318
So I went along to look out
for him. See?

1229
01:22:43,265 --> 01:22:44,375
What are you telling me?

1230
01:22:44,401 --> 01:22:45,804
It was the three of us.

1231
01:22:48,776 --> 01:22:51,820
The three of us, me and Jessie
and Adam.

1232
01:22:51,821 --> 01:22:53,851
And Adam got caught.

1233
01:23:03,123 --> 01:23:04,624
Well, where's Jessie now?

1234
01:23:04,805 --> 01:23:05,864
I don't know.

1235
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:15,355
You turn him in.

1236
01:23:17,165 --> 01:23:18,027
Yeah.

1237
01:23:18,458 --> 01:23:19,402
What?

1238
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:21,650
And yourself too.

1239
01:23:21,971 --> 01:23:23,025
And...

1240
01:23:24,318 --> 01:23:27,690
You explain to the judge how
a boy like Adam couldn't resist...

1241
01:23:33,214 --> 01:23:36,547
Following his father
and his grandfather into this madness.

1242
01:23:41,122 --> 01:23:43,259
You get my son out of jail, Vito...

1243
01:23:49,159 --> 01:23:52,446
Or I'll turn you and your stinking
father over to the police.

1244
01:24:14,655 --> 01:24:17,163
Where you going, uh?
Where you going?

1245
01:24:17,164 --> 01:24:19,343
- Come on, I want the plasmids.
- What are you talking about?

1246
01:24:19,344 --> 01:24:22,219
You switched the fucking plasmids.
What you got in there?

1247
01:24:22,263 --> 01:24:25,398
- You gave me fucking water!
- None of your fucking business.

1248
01:24:25,399 --> 01:24:28,602
What do you got in there?
Give me it! Open the fucking box!

1249
01:24:28,603 --> 01:24:31,605
Open the box! Give it to me!
Don't make me do something.

1250
01:24:31,606 --> 01:24:34,759
Don't you understand?
I don't have the fucking plasmids!

1251
01:24:40,954 --> 01:24:43,694
Welcome home, Vito. Here!

1252
01:24:44,352 --> 01:24:46,186
I know you fucking switched them.

1253
01:24:46,187 --> 01:24:49,356
You didn't get as far from
Hell's Kitchen as you thought, did you?

1254
01:24:49,357 --> 01:24:50,983
All right, where are they?

1255
01:24:51,025 --> 01:24:54,061
- I'm telling you the truth you fool!
- You never told me the truth.

1256
01:24:54,095 --> 01:24:55,262
Well, I am now.

1257
01:24:55,263 --> 01:24:58,435
You spout your all life about family
and loyalty, and it's all crap.

1258
01:24:58,436 --> 01:25:01,045
Stop whining about your childhood.

1259
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:04,048
You sound like every asshole
on the television talk show.

1260
01:25:04,224 --> 01:25:07,078
You're 43 years old,
for chrissakes! Here!

1261
01:25:07,492 --> 01:25:09,801
He was fine till you got
a hold of him.

1262
01:25:09,809 --> 01:25:12,193
- Fine?
- And I would have been fine too.

1263
01:25:12,194 --> 01:25:15,811
Fine. That poor kid doesn't know
his ass from a hole in the ground.

1264
01:25:15,816 --> 01:25:18,752
It's no wonder, the kind
of fucking father you've been.

1265
01:25:18,753 --> 01:25:20,630
- The kind of father I've been?
- Yes.

1266
01:25:20,631 --> 01:25:24,784
The kind of father I've been?!
What is this, some kind of fucking joke?

1267
01:25:24,795 --> 01:25:27,287
You're all ass-backwards
with that kid...

1268
01:25:27,725 --> 01:25:30,621
Tiptoeing around, hoping he's gonna
pat you on the fucking head.

1269
01:25:30,665 --> 01:25:34,101
That's right. The kid that I steered
into being a Westinghouse Scholar.

1270
01:25:34,178 --> 01:25:36,903
You spend your life talking
"Westinghouse Scholar."

1271
01:25:36,904 --> 01:25:39,805
- Well, what's the matter with that?
- It's all bullshit.

1272
01:25:39,991 --> 01:25:42,194
And Adam knows it better
than any of us.

1273
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:44,819
Now why do you think he set
this whole thing up?

1274
01:25:46,482 --> 01:25:49,491
Because he can smell the real Vito!
That's why.

1275
01:25:49,986 --> 01:25:51,180
Smell what?

1276
01:25:51,206 --> 01:25:52,656
This Vito.

1277
01:25:53,332 --> 01:25:54,623
This Vito.

1278
01:25:54,873 --> 01:25:56,543
That's the real Vito.

1279
01:25:56,921 --> 01:25:59,116
That's the one he wants respect from.

1280
01:25:59,297 --> 01:26:00,766
Do you understand?

1281
01:26:04,762 --> 01:26:06,146
No one at home.

1282
01:26:06,884 --> 01:26:08,671
You're a fucking lost cause.

1283
01:26:10,843 --> 01:26:12,498
And look at the mess you've made.

1284
01:26:22,450 --> 01:26:23,902
I'm gonna give you up.

1285
01:26:23,928 --> 01:26:25,016
Did you hear what I said?

1286
01:26:25,820 --> 01:26:27,319
I'm gonna give you up.

1287
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:29,638
Up yours... Guinea midget.

1288
01:26:37,537 --> 01:26:39,138
Water!

1289
01:27:17,623 --> 01:27:18,959
What the hell?!

1290
01:27:19,474 --> 01:27:21,881
I'm Adam McMullen's granddad.

1291
01:27:24,171 --> 01:27:25,092
So...

1292
01:27:25,522 --> 01:27:27,842
The company's put you
back on the payroll.

1293
01:27:29,053 --> 01:27:32,522
At first, I couldn't figure
why they weren't screaming louder.

1294
01:27:33,608 --> 01:27:34,889
I'm gonna call security.

1295
01:27:34,928 --> 01:27:36,208
Look...

1296
01:27:36,209 --> 01:27:40,537
I've got the logbook and the tubes
of water. You want we go public?

1297
01:27:45,958 --> 01:27:48,779
Then it was water we took
out of your lab.

1298
01:27:54,189 --> 01:27:55,412
Tell me...

1299
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:57,224
What was it?

1300
01:27:58,028 --> 01:27:59,731
An insurance scam?

1301
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:04,739
No?

1302
01:28:05,232 --> 01:28:07,959
Well, you got one big piece
of luck in all this.

1303
01:28:08,952 --> 01:28:10,373
What's that?

1304
01:28:11,041 --> 01:28:12,533
That I can be bought.

1305
01:28:14,655 --> 01:28:16,748
Why don't you tell me the story,
Wong?

1306
01:28:17,131 --> 01:28:19,013
- The name's Jimmy.
- Jimmy.

1307
01:28:20,481 --> 01:28:22,142
It's not about insurance.

1308
01:28:22,403 --> 01:28:23,495
No?

1309
01:28:23,638 --> 01:28:26,334
We've been promising this
new discovery for almost a year.

1310
01:28:26,373 --> 01:28:28,193
We dug a hole for ourselves.

1311
01:28:30,386 --> 01:28:33,214
Goddamned thing always looked
a week away.

1312
01:28:34,128 --> 01:28:35,561
Never worked.

1313
01:28:35,950 --> 01:28:38,089
It's a tough game, science, isn't it?

1314
01:28:39,855 --> 01:28:41,292
We've just gone public...

1315
01:28:41,498 --> 01:28:43,481
An 80 million dollars offering.

1316
01:28:44,470 --> 01:28:48,399
The financial community has valued
this company based on this discovery...

1317
01:28:49,812 --> 01:28:52,986
And your burglary buys us
six more months development time.

1318
01:28:53,410 --> 01:28:58,587
So long as the logbook and
the plasmids are never ever recovered.

1319
01:28:59,350 --> 01:29:01,992
That's what you had in mind
in the first place, wasn't it?

1320
01:29:15,980 --> 01:29:17,880
Police. Freeze.

1321
01:29:18,034 --> 01:29:19,852
Keep your hands over your head.

1322
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:22,993
Cut that crap out.

1323
01:29:23,030 --> 01:29:25,965
Hi, Charlie. It's been a long time.
Where's the beef here?

1324
01:29:26,063 --> 01:29:28,587
- Hey, where are you going?
- It's all legal.

1325
01:29:29,297 --> 01:29:30,673
What's he got there?

1326
01:29:35,142 --> 01:29:36,055
Vito.

1327
01:29:36,573 --> 01:29:38,283
He ratted you out, Jessie.

1328
01:29:45,419 --> 01:29:47,141
I didn't think he'd do it.

1329
01:29:49,383 --> 01:29:51,977
Does the State have anything to add
to the report?

1330
01:29:52,032 --> 01:29:53,579
- No, Your Honor.
- Counselor?

1331
01:29:53,627 --> 01:29:54,555
No, sir.

1332
01:29:54,594 --> 01:29:57,555
Would the young Mr. McMullen like
to say something on his own behalf?

1333
01:29:58,638 --> 01:30:02,462
No, Your Honor, I would like to say
something on my grandfather's behalf.

1334
01:30:05,206 --> 01:30:06,415
Go ahead.

1335
01:30:10,274 --> 01:30:11,968
My grandfather has...

1336
01:30:12,433 --> 01:30:14,360
Always tried to take care of me.

1337
01:30:16,646 --> 01:30:19,938
I know that he didn't cooperate
with the police here...

1338
01:30:20,424 --> 01:30:22,383
But that's because I didn't
want him to.

1339
01:30:23,773 --> 01:30:26,672
He's always respected... My wishes.

1340
01:30:27,728 --> 01:30:29,735
He's always respected who I am.

1341
01:30:32,197 --> 01:30:34,240
And whatever's written
in those reports...

1342
01:30:34,795 --> 01:30:36,389
Can't show it.

1343
01:30:38,504 --> 01:30:40,508
My grandpa loves me.

1344
01:30:41,784 --> 01:30:43,258
He always has.

1345
01:30:43,872 --> 01:30:45,305
And I love him.

1346
01:30:47,293 --> 01:30:50,227
This whole thing, Your Honor,
it wasn't his idea.

1347
01:30:51,299 --> 01:30:52,852
It was mine.

1348
01:30:57,274 --> 01:30:58,516
Duly noted.

1349
01:30:58,910 --> 01:31:00,073
Counselor.

1350
01:31:02,856 --> 01:31:05,620
I've known Jessie McMullen
for 35 years and...

1351
01:31:05,833 --> 01:31:09,399
In how many of the arrests in McMullen's
career have you represented him?

1352
01:31:11,473 --> 01:31:13,071
More than a few, Your Honor.

1353
01:31:13,978 --> 01:31:16,633
Jessie McMullen
is a man in his 60s.

1354
01:31:17,171 --> 01:31:19,540
Any sentence, other than a token...

1355
01:31:20,133 --> 01:31:22,290
Would really be a life sentence,
Your Honor.

1356
01:31:22,792 --> 01:31:25,165
To give him five or
10 years in prison...

1357
01:31:25,683 --> 01:31:28,329
Is not a 5 or a 10-year sentence...

1358
01:31:29,442 --> 01:31:30,594
It's a sentence of...

1359
01:31:31,292 --> 01:31:32,626
Life imprisonment.

1360
01:31:37,563 --> 01:31:39,141
Vito McMullen.

1361
01:31:43,238 --> 01:31:46,007
It it were not for the fact that you
finally showed some decency...

1362
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:48,110
By turning in your father,
as well as yourself...

1363
01:31:48,136 --> 01:31:50,297
I would have put you
away for five years.

1364
01:31:51,335 --> 01:31:53,485
You're a sorry
excuse for a parent.

1365
01:31:53,910 --> 01:31:55,948
Three years of
supervised probation.

1366
01:31:59,932 --> 01:32:01,469
Adam McMullen.

1367
01:32:03,066 --> 01:32:06,359
The company's intervention on your behalf
would count for little with me...

1368
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:08,743
It does seem, however,
to count with the prosecution...

1369
01:32:08,797 --> 01:32:12,579
And I am going to go along reluctantly
with the plea bargain arrangement.

1370
01:32:13,559 --> 01:32:18,087
Being guilty of a Class A misdemeanor,
you are sentenced to 5 years probation.

1371
01:32:20,631 --> 01:32:24,847
Readsing these background reports though,
convinced me there were mitigating circumstances.

1372
01:32:26,407 --> 01:32:27,946
Jessie McMullen.

1373
01:32:36,483 --> 01:32:38,524
I have by far devoted
most of my thinking...

1374
01:32:38,559 --> 01:32:40,883
To how the court should treat
Jessie McMullen.

1375
01:32:42,218 --> 01:32:45,305
If there is a culprit in this case,
you certainly fit the bill.

1376
01:32:46,611 --> 01:32:50,118
You've never seen fit to produce
the stolen plasmids or the logbook.

1377
01:32:50,674 --> 01:32:53,239
Among other thins you've
held up the development...

1378
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:56,297
Of an important new scientific
discovery from six months to a year.

1379
01:32:57,814 --> 01:33:00,146
But as your lawyer points out,
you're not young man.

1380
01:33:00,147 --> 01:33:03,810
It's not an easy matter to decide on
a sentence for someone of your years.

1381
01:33:04,785 --> 01:33:06,657
I've had to think this out carefully.

1382
01:33:10,848 --> 01:33:12,993
For armed robbery, 15 years.

1383
01:33:13,555 --> 01:33:15,797
For burglary in the first degree,
10 years.

1384
01:33:16,108 --> 01:33:17,969
Sentences to run concurrently.

1385
01:33:33,257 --> 01:33:34,912
Grandpa.

1386
01:33:35,978 --> 01:33:37,647
Hey...

1387
01:33:37,991 --> 01:33:40,920
If you can't do the time,
don't do the crime.

1388
01:33:44,671 --> 01:33:46,332
Jessie.

1389
01:33:49,823 --> 01:33:51,269
Ray.

1390
01:33:56,099 --> 01:33:58,506
Hey, you baldheaded prick.

1391
01:34:00,107 --> 01:34:02,420
Don't you ever get caught
on the take...

1392
01:34:03,027 --> 01:34:05,269
Because if you end
up in any joint I'm in...

1393
01:34:05,850 --> 01:34:07,855
You'll leave feet first.

1394
01:34:13,449 --> 01:34:15,714
You come by every month or so,
you hear?

1395
01:34:17,244 --> 01:34:18,847
When do they ship you out?

1396
01:34:19,822 --> 01:34:21,363
Today, tomorrow.

1397
01:34:23,461 --> 01:34:24,785
I'll come every two weeks.

1398
01:34:24,786 --> 01:34:25,932
Every month is fine.

1399
01:34:27,848 --> 01:34:29,104
Gonna be tough?

1400
01:34:29,842 --> 01:34:31,879
For me? No.

1401
01:34:32,272 --> 01:34:34,045
You pick out a tough guy...

1402
01:34:34,046 --> 01:34:36,476
Kick his ass right away, give him
a real good beating.

1403
01:34:36,477 --> 01:34:39,449
Word gets around,
and it makes your time easier.

1404
01:34:41,027 --> 01:34:42,628
They don't put you in solitary?

1405
01:34:42,692 --> 01:34:45,222
No, nobody wants trouble.

1406
01:34:46,767 --> 01:34:51,566
So you do it out of sight, no one
asks questions, the story is, "He fell."

1407
01:34:54,121 --> 01:34:55,511
I'll see you in a month.

1408
01:35:23,423 --> 01:35:25,551
I hear your kid fucked you over.

1409
01:35:25,577 --> 01:35:27,841
Tough way to start
your time, Pop.

1410
01:35:30,764 --> 01:35:33,337
Now, why would he
give a shit...

1411
01:35:33,363 --> 01:35:36,125
Whether I start my time
tough or easy?

1412
01:35:36,126 --> 01:35:38,079
Hey, no big deal Pop, I mean...

1413
01:35:38,105 --> 01:35:39,805
We all got some long bits
to do, you know?

1414
01:35:39,806 --> 01:35:44,710
And, you know, a little chitchat,
and time's half over before you know it.

1415
01:35:44,711 --> 01:35:47,788
That's the second time
you've called me "Pop."

1416
01:35:47,789 --> 01:35:51,515
I got around a lot when I was young,
but I doubt if I'm your father.

1417
01:35:51,539 --> 01:35:53,239
But who knows though?

1418
01:35:54,288 --> 01:35:57,086
You carry a picture of your mother?
Maybe I'll remember her.

1419
01:35:57,116 --> 01:35:59,586
I must have fucked half the whores
on the East Coast.

1420
01:35:59,626 --> 01:36:01,150
You fucking...

1421
01:36:11,772 --> 01:36:13,137
What happened?

1422
01:36:13,307 --> 01:36:15,241
He fell.

1423
01:36:22,937 --> 01:36:25,057
You know, Mom and Dad ask
about you all the time, Adam.

1424
01:36:25,058 --> 01:36:26,112
You ought to call them.

1425
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:28,895
I guess you visit
your grandfather a lot.

1426
01:36:29,342 --> 01:36:31,020
Yeah, every three or four weeks.

1427
01:36:32,859 --> 01:36:34,121
He's not doing so well.

1428
01:36:34,294 --> 01:36:36,849
I wouldn't worry about Jessie, Adam.
He's a real survivor.

1429
01:36:40,571 --> 01:36:42,536
You know, Adam, it's been six months.

1430
01:36:43,786 --> 01:36:45,310
Your father loves you, Adam.

1431
01:36:45,311 --> 01:36:47,544
Mom, I told you I don't want to
hear about him.

1432
01:36:48,678 --> 01:36:51,277
I mean this. The next time
you bring up his name...

1433
01:36:51,278 --> 01:36:53,489
Will be the last time
that you ever hear from me.

1434
01:37:01,267 --> 01:37:02,514
I'll call you next week.

1435
01:37:02,540 --> 01:37:03,514
Okay, sweetheart.

1436
01:37:11,227 --> 01:37:12,479
Adam.

1437
01:37:20,612 --> 01:37:24,627
Listen, God forbid one of us should get
hit by a truck tomorrow, you know?

1438
01:37:28,974 --> 01:37:31,221
Let's not let it happen
while we're still mad at each other.

1439
01:37:38,825 --> 01:37:40,479
You turned out to be...

1440
01:37:42,232 --> 01:37:43,901
A piece of garbage.

1441
01:37:50,102 --> 01:37:53,622
Adam, Adam. So, what is your gripe?
What the fuck is your gripe?

1442
01:37:53,639 --> 01:37:55,140
- Gripe?
- Yeah.

1443
01:37:55,142 --> 01:37:57,610
- You turned in your father.
- I turned in my...

1444
01:37:57,611 --> 01:38:00,046
- He's your father!
- I turned myself in too.

1445
01:38:00,047 --> 01:38:02,214
- I turned us both in for you.
- Stop it!

1446
01:38:02,215 --> 01:38:03,883
- For you.
- Stop doing things for me!

1447
01:38:03,884 --> 01:38:05,996
What did I do that was so terrible?

1448
01:38:05,997 --> 01:38:08,688
I tried to give you a better
childhood than I had.

1449
01:38:08,689 --> 01:38:11,138
No, don't give me
the terrible childhood crap.

1450
01:38:13,238 --> 01:38:16,044
You had a lot more fun
as a kid than I ever did.

1451
01:38:17,686 --> 01:38:20,513
Jessie was fun... For chrissake.

1452
01:38:23,264 --> 01:38:27,200
He showed a lot more confidence in you
as a kid than you ever did in me.

1453
01:38:27,441 --> 01:38:29,156
He showed more respect for you...

1454
01:38:29,555 --> 01:38:30,571
As a person...

1455
01:38:32,875 --> 01:38:34,372
Than you ever did for me.

1456
01:38:35,716 --> 01:38:37,396
- Come on.
- Get off.

1457
01:39:21,432 --> 01:39:23,404
You still got a grip of steel, huh?

1458
01:39:28,188 --> 01:39:30,974
You tell me I'm looking good,
I'll pop you on the nose.

1459
01:39:37,045 --> 01:39:38,787
I screwed him okay.

1460
01:39:39,967 --> 01:39:40,887
Who, Jessie?

1461
01:39:40,888 --> 01:39:44,388
I'm not even gonna do a year,
that baldheaded prick.

1462
01:39:48,609 --> 01:39:49,943
How are you doing?

1463
01:39:51,482 --> 01:39:53,045
I'm keeping out of trouble.

1464
01:39:55,434 --> 01:39:57,287
Sounds as bad as doing time.

1465
01:40:08,802 --> 01:40:10,357
You're a prince.

1466
01:40:21,254 --> 01:40:24,154
I'm sorry about the way
things turned out, Jessie.

1467
01:40:25,459 --> 01:40:26,326
Hey!

1468
01:40:27,194 --> 01:40:28,974
You play the cards you're dealt.

1469
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:35,732
I was damn lucky.

1470
01:40:37,704 --> 01:40:39,802
They could have put me away
for 10 years.

1471
01:40:55,926 --> 01:40:57,670
Who got my charges reduced?

1472
01:40:58,170 --> 01:40:59,232
The charges?

1473
01:40:59,694 --> 01:41:00,498
Me!

1474
01:41:01,551 --> 01:41:05,513
I managed to squeeze a few lousy bucks
out of your Chinaman friend too.

1475
01:41:06,897 --> 01:41:08,153
I spent it, Adam...

1476
01:41:08,516 --> 01:41:09,671
Every nickel.

1477
01:41:10,403 --> 01:41:12,584
I thought about splitting
it with you, Adam.

1478
01:41:12,907 --> 01:41:13,913
I really did.

1479
01:41:15,227 --> 01:41:16,623
Then I thought...

1480
01:41:17,496 --> 01:41:19,427
If I'm gonna do the time...

1481
01:41:19,860 --> 01:41:22,549
Well, I have a little vigorish
coming to me.

1482
01:41:24,396 --> 01:41:25,334
So...

1483
01:41:26,528 --> 01:41:28,467
I figured the best thing was...

1484
01:41:29,332 --> 01:41:30,912
Just not to mention it.

1485
01:41:32,060 --> 01:41:33,717
Even Vito couldn't
argue with that.

1486
01:41:34,150 --> 01:41:35,302
Vito.

1487
01:41:36,139 --> 01:41:38,443
Vito... A lost cause.

1488
01:41:40,300 --> 01:41:41,693
From the beginning...

1489
01:41:42,415 --> 01:41:43,795
A lost cause.

1490
01:41:49,476 --> 01:41:51,177
You're your own man now...

1491
01:41:55,911 --> 01:41:57,675
Well, I'm out from under Vito.

1492
01:41:58,506 --> 01:41:59,730
Good.

1493
01:42:02,041 --> 01:42:04,112
You think you can get out
from under me?

1494
01:42:14,407 --> 01:42:16,323
No, Mom, I don't wanna talk to him.

1495
01:42:17,074 --> 01:42:18,706
No, just tell him that...

1496
01:42:19,239 --> 01:42:20,777
That Jessie is dying.

1497
01:42:21,683 --> 01:42:24,417
They're moving him from the infirmary
into the prison hospital.

1498
01:42:26,046 --> 01:42:27,456
Yeah, just tell him.

1499
01:42:27,859 --> 01:42:29,401
Okay, bye.

1500
01:42:38,928 --> 01:42:40,249
I'm looking...

1501
01:42:40,678 --> 01:42:42,237
Hi, I'm looking
for Jessie McMullen.

1502
01:42:42,914 --> 01:42:44,370
They just wheeled him
out of here.

1503
01:42:44,818 --> 01:42:45,725
Which way?

1504
01:42:45,751 --> 01:42:47,208
Won't do you no good.

1505
01:42:47,434 --> 01:42:48,761
Which way?!

1506
01:42:49,803 --> 01:42:52,870
Go back the way you came,
take the elevator to the basement.

1507
01:42:52,871 --> 01:42:53,785
Basement?

1508
01:42:54,232 --> 01:42:55,402
To the basement?

1509
01:43:01,148 --> 01:43:02,089
Hey!

1510
01:43:02,248 --> 01:43:03,700
Wait!

1511
01:43:04,322 --> 01:43:05,925
Is that Jessie McMullen?

1512
01:43:07,583 --> 01:43:08,487
Hey!

1513
01:43:09,363 --> 01:43:10,309
Please!

1514
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:12,229
Wait a minute,
don't shut the door.

1515
01:43:49,043 --> 01:43:50,635
- Hi, Ma.
- Hello.

1516
01:43:50,873 --> 01:43:53,491
- So?
- So it's so big I can't find anything.

1517
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:55,734
- Hi, Papa. Hi.
- Hi, Rose.

1518
01:43:55,735 --> 01:43:56,902
Thank you, Vito.

1519
01:43:56,903 --> 01:43:59,923
- My first time in your new house.
- I'm sorry about your father, Vito.

1520
01:44:00,412 --> 01:44:03,321
I know. Hey, who
have we got here?

1521
01:44:05,594 --> 01:44:07,134
Hiya, Nat.

1522
01:44:08,588 --> 01:44:10,305
It's all right, don't get up.

1523
01:44:17,957 --> 01:44:21,393
After 25 years, the shaygets
knows two Jewish words.

1524
01:44:21,394 --> 01:44:23,391
Well, you know.
Here, let me help you.

1525
01:44:34,941 --> 01:44:36,501
Time to let the angel in.

1526
01:44:36,949 --> 01:44:39,782
The angel won't have to squeeze
in under the chain.

1527
01:44:41,514 --> 01:44:44,751
I knew that was coming.
Your material is getting stale.

1528
01:44:48,229 --> 01:44:50,424
- Look who's here.
- Grandma.

1529
01:44:50,723 --> 01:44:54,024
I've been outside a half an hour waiting
for you to open the door for Elijah.

1530
01:45:14,948 --> 01:45:18,569
Anyway, they were thrilled that you
stopped by to see them.

1531
01:45:18,585 --> 01:45:22,387
Yeah, well, no reason to take
our problems out on them, huh?

1532
01:45:22,388 --> 01:45:24,697
Wait a minute, you gonna wait
for your mother to come down?

1533
01:45:25,525 --> 01:45:27,455
She'll be saying goodbye
for 20 minutes.

1534
01:45:28,962 --> 01:45:32,097
Plus, we'll just get in the same
old argument again.

1535
01:45:32,098 --> 01:45:33,725
What's the same old argument?

1536
01:45:35,872 --> 01:45:38,194
That everything you did,
you did for me.

1537
01:45:48,047 --> 01:45:51,647
If you hated the meat business
so much for 20 years...

1538
01:45:53,757 --> 01:45:56,358
Then I'm sorry, but stop blaming me.

1539
01:45:58,644 --> 01:46:00,271
You did it to yourself.

1540
01:46:10,123 --> 01:46:13,084
What's the most fun you've had
since you were a kid?

1541
01:46:15,542 --> 01:46:17,186
What's the most fun I've had?

1542
01:46:17,572 --> 01:46:19,131
Yeah, since you were a kid.

1543
01:46:22,615 --> 01:46:23,843
What?

1544
01:46:24,417 --> 01:46:25,631
The caper.

1545
01:46:25,952 --> 01:46:27,920
- The caper? The caper.
- Yeah.

1546
01:46:28,087 --> 01:46:29,428
Me too.

1547
01:46:31,893 --> 01:46:33,241
Oh, boy.

1548
01:46:34,148 --> 01:46:35,702
We are some family.

1549
01:46:40,355 --> 01:46:43,561
You know, the only time the three of us
ever had a drink together...

1550
01:46:43,851 --> 01:46:45,694
Was when we were
planning that robbery.

1551
01:46:49,833 --> 01:46:51,788
We are some family.

1552
01:46:57,050 --> 01:46:59,397
I brought back his ashes, Pop.

1553
01:47:01,988 --> 01:47:04,139
I thought that maybe the two of us...

1554
01:47:05,118 --> 01:47:07,366
Ought to bury him together.
Thank you.

1555
01:47:09,420 --> 01:47:10,545
Thank you.

1556
01:47:18,087 --> 01:47:20,146
You have any idea
what we ought to do with him?

1557
01:47:23,489 --> 01:47:24,959
Yes, I do.

1558
01:47:27,648 --> 01:47:29,616
So, what are you gonna do
with yourself now, Adam?

1559
01:47:29,642 --> 01:47:31,351
What do you want to
do with your life?

1560
01:47:34,883 --> 01:47:36,655
That's the first time
you ever asked me that.

1561
01:47:37,023 --> 01:47:38,333
- First time?
- Yeah.

1562
01:47:40,355 --> 01:47:42,686
All right, I'll ask
you a second time.

1563
01:47:42,752 --> 01:47:44,311
What do you wanna
do with your life?

1564
01:47:45,231 --> 01:47:46,975
Well, now that you ask me...

1565
01:47:48,357 --> 01:47:49,545
I don't know.

1566
01:47:50,970 --> 01:47:53,163
We lived in this building
when my mother died.

1567
01:47:54,858 --> 01:47:56,164
Right on that corner there...

1568
01:47:56,165 --> 01:47:58,334
Jessie pushed me into
my first fight.

1569
01:48:00,832 --> 01:48:02,514
It's his neighborhood, okay.

1570
01:48:12,064 --> 01:48:13,881
Okay, now lift.

1571
01:48:14,561 --> 01:48:16,545
You've got to be kidding.

1572
01:48:23,970 --> 01:48:26,271
- Where do you want this keg?
- All the way up.

1573
01:48:26,272 --> 01:48:27,873
This is an open-air service.

1574
01:48:27,878 --> 01:48:29,908
Here we go.

1575
01:48:29,909 --> 01:48:32,401
I thought I told you guys
to get light beer.

1576
01:48:34,245 --> 01:48:36,011
If I'd have known
this was a roof job...

1577
01:48:36,076 --> 01:48:37,722
I would have went
for wristwatches.

1578
01:48:55,401 --> 01:48:58,700
I know! I know the Church
approves of cremation.

1579
01:48:58,871 --> 01:49:02,574
But the Church also approves of playing
the guitar at the Mass these days.

1580
01:49:02,575 --> 01:49:05,738
Vito, over the side with him.

1581
01:49:06,446 --> 01:49:08,913
Folks, hold it down, Jessie's going.

1582
01:49:10,196 --> 01:49:11,663
Quiet.

1583
01:49:14,922 --> 01:49:17,686
- Goodbye, Jessie.
- See you on the other side, Jessie.

1584
01:49:17,890 --> 01:49:20,154
So long, Jessie!

1585
01:49:20,275 --> 01:49:21,632
Goodbye!

1586
01:49:27,166 --> 01:49:28,726
I'm sorry, Adam.

1587
01:49:30,002 --> 01:49:31,257
For what?

1588
01:49:33,148 --> 01:49:34,734
I'm just sorry.

1589
01:49:38,778 --> 01:49:40,382
Well, me too.

1590
01:49:41,366 --> 01:49:42,826
I'm sorry too.

1591
01:50:46,699 --> 01:50:48,976
You know the words to this song?

1592
01:50:49,636 --> 01:50:51,585
I think I heard it once before.

1593
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,109

1594
01:50:56,305 --> 01:51:02,248
