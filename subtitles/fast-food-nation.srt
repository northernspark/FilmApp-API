and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

2
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,918
<i>Uh, what about,</i>
<i>"The Big One only gets bigger"?</i>

3
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,996
"Everyone wants a Big One."

4
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:19,394
I got a big one. Sorry.

5
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:23,367
<i>How about just, like, "Eat me."</i>

6
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:27,064
Okay, okay. There's no shortage
of future slogans. Phil, what have you got?

7
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:32,577
Well, um, same-store sales
are up 8.4% this quarter...

8
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,772
which is just... amazing.

9
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,714
<i>And the increase extends</i>
<i>across every demographic.</i>

10
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:42,447
It's "tweens," heavy users,
minivan dads, even seniors.

11
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,955
<i>So, clearly, the Big One</i>
<i>is not only a big hit...</i>

12
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,720
it is quickly becoming
the flagship of our brand.

13
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:50,921
Which we'll be building on, both in
the upcoming second half of our campaign...

14
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,930
and in merchandising.

15
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:55,057
Terrific. Don, what about
those Little Big Ones?

16
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:59,434
Well, uh, last week, you know,
we did a pretty extensive focus group...

17
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:02,303
with some of the kids
from Martin Luther King Elementary.

18
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,308
- Yeah?
- And it went great.

19
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,072
Tested 91% in the top three boxes.
They loved 'em.

20
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,546
What is it now, eight to a bag?

21
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:13,312
- No, no, no. You're thinking
about the Itty Bittys.
- Oh.

22
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,479
No, no. We figure three Little Big Ones
for each kid's meal...

23
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,750
is gonna work out about right.

24
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:21,520
But we wanna do a little more
testing on that as well.

25
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:25,120
- How about Disney?
- No word yet.

26
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:29,065
<i>Also, the PBS deal</i>
<i>doesn't seem to be happening.</i>

27
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:33,229
Uh, apparently Burger King and McDonald's
have the Teletubbies all locked up.

28
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,274
Fuck 'em.

29
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,852
That's wonderful.

30
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,115
Yeah? You like that?
That's the Barbecue Big One.

31
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,953
Wow. Tastes like it's
right off the grill.

32
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,620
You don't think it needs liquid smoke
or any other kind of flavorings?

33
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:58,924
No. No, no, no.
I think it's perfect.

34
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,933
- Let's test that.
- Okay. Try this one.

35
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:12,539
- I don't know.
- Yeah. These Caribbean seasonings
are kind of tricky.

36
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,079
We're calling 'em
Calypso Chicken Tenders.

37
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:18,810
I think people are gonna
have an expectation for, uh...

38
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:20,886
maybe a touch of lime.

39
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,978
Oh, lime? Lime's easy.

40
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:26,183
I just held back on the terpinoline on this
to keep the flavorings subtle.

41
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,192
But I can always go back
and add more.

42
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:31,229
- Yeah. Why don't you try that?
- I'll keep working on it.

43
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,299
<i>I really, really enjoyed it. You were wonderful.</i>

44
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,299
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

45
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,995
Okay. Look, I gotta go.

46
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:40,868
<i>I'll talk to you later.</i>
<i>Yeah, bye.</i>

47
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:43,464
Thanks, Louise.

48
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:46,739
Donny boy. Have a seat.

49
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:50,776
Thanks for stopping by.

50
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:53,078
So, what do you think of everything?

51
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,986
It's good, good.
I'm glad to see the Big One doin' so well.

52
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:01,527
Hmm. Listen, you ever
run into a guy named Harry Rydell...

53
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,993
executive V.P.
out of the Chicago office?

54
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,327
I don't think so.

55
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:09,230
He works closely with our suppliers.

56
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:13,101
A little too closely, if you ask me.

57
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,367
What do you mean?

58
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:20,879
I have a friend that teaches food science
over at A&M- microbiology.

59
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,676
And this semester,
a couple of his grad students...

60
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:27,651
decided to culture some patties
from a bunch of fast-food chains.

61
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:30,655
- Mm-hmm.
- Well-

62
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:33,851
They got ahold of a couple
of Big Ones- frozen patties.

63
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,860
Don't ask me how.

64
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:39,193
And the fecal coliform counts
were just off the charts.

65
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,797
<i>I'm concerned that this</i>
<i>could be a problem for us.</i>

66
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,133
Do you understand what I'm saying?

67
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:50,572
Uh- Not exactly.

68
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:55,514
I'm saying there's shit in the meat.

69
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:20,667
Mm-hmm.

70
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,912
Mmm.

71
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:51,965
"The drawbridge was down.
The great gate stood wide.

72
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:54,130
"I entered without challenge...

73
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,607
my own heels making
the only sounds I heard."

74
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,675
- Keep going.
- No.

75
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:05,444
- It's bedtime.
- Just one more.

76
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,849
- Please.
- No. That's it.

77
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,226
Good night, Stevie.

78
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,226
Hey.

79
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:22,358
- I think I may have to miss
your history exhibit on Thursday.
- Why?

80
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:27,269
Well, you know how Daddy has to go
out of town for work every now and then?

81
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:30,308
- Yeah, but I thought you didn't have to.
- Well, not as much.

82
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:33,310
But I gotta go to Colorado
for a couple of days.

83
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:36,279
All right? I'll be home
for the weekend though.

84
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:38,350
Okay.

85
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,419
I love you guys.

86
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:46,421
Too much E. coli in stuff. People could get sick.

87
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,017
Is that the one that can kill kids?

88
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:51,892
I don't know. I don't think so.

89
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,933
I mean,
nobody's gotten sick or anything.

90
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:58,697
But Jack says too much cow manure
is somehow getting into the meat.

91
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:00,772
<i>That's disgusting.</i>

92
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:05,435
That's my new job. Same office-
still dealing with bullshit.

93
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,844
<i>Well, I guess it is a marketing issue after all.</i>

94
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,178
If the kids die
from eating your burgers...

95
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,252
it makes them much harder to sell.

96
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:15,343
That's right. Marketing 101.

97
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:17,422
Don't kill the customer.

98
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:20,287
Bad for repeat business.

99
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,110
Mm-hmm.

100
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,728
<i>¿Coco?</i>

101
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:09,265
<i>¿Coco?</i>

102
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,113
Hi.

103
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,182
<i>No.</i>

104
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:00,447
I sent that form in. I paid it.

105
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,283
<i>Hey, you tell that coach</i>
<i>and that whole fucking league...</i>

106
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,790
if he doesn't play,
I'm gonna kick all their asses.

107
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,884
<i>Sí.</i> Yeah, yeah.

108
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:12,293
I just did a pickup.
I'll talk to you later.

109
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,383
Gracias.

110
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,393
No.

111
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:21,969
- <i>Sí.</i>
- <i>Sí.</i>

112
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:33,249
<i>Oh, God! Yeah!</i>

113
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,980
<i>You like the way that feels?</i>

114
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:41,519
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh!

115
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:45,427
That's right, bitch.

116
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:50,800
- Do you like it when I pull your hair?
- Yes! Yes, pull my hair!

117
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:54,805
- That's right, slut.
- I love it when you call me "slut."

118
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,966
Let's go. Stand up.

119
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,841
Yo. Stand up.
Come on. Stand up.

120
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,249
Hey!

121
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,453
Stand up.

122
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,291
What the fuck you doin'?

123
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,992
Fuckin' people on vacation.

124
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,270
Go.

125
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:11,648
Hang on a second.

126
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,782
Welcome to Mickeys.
Can I take your order?

127
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:23,122
Yeah. I'm thinkin' about a Big One.

128
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:25,219
Okay. Would you like
some large fries with that?

129
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,560
No. No, thanks. Not tonight.

130
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:31,500
- Our supervalue drink?
- I'll have a chocolate shake and a water.

131
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:34,163
All right. Would you like
any dessert with that?

132
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:37,071
- A brownie pie or a turnover?
- No, not tonight.

133
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,703
Okay. Uh, that'll be 4.98.

134
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:44,248
Okay. Here you go.

135
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:49,576
<i>So, what's your favorite thing</i>
<i>on the menu?</i>

136
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,485
I like everything.

137
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,888
Well, I know that's not true.

138
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:56,825
But you did give me
the correct answer.

139
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,727
I was just testing you. I'm actually
a vice president of marketing for Mickeys.

140
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:02,595
- Really?
- Yeah. It's true.

141
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:06,728
Just here in town for a couple of days
seein' where the Big Ones come from.

142
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:09,398
- Here?
- Oh, no, not <i>here</i>.

143
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,499
<i>But at Uni-Globe Meat Packing</i>
<i>just outside of town.</i>

144
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:15,808
That's where every single Big One patty
in the entire country gets made.

145
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:18,576
- No way.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

146
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:21,118
- It's amazing.
- Wow.

147
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,882
Lettuce.

148
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:27,948
Pickles and cheese.

149
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:31,153
Special-

150
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,232
I think I burned the meat.

151
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:50,372
Amber. Order up.

152
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,990
- There you go.
- Okay. Thank you.

153
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,889
- What's your name?
- Amber.

154
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,656
Right. Don Anderson.

155
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,594
- It's nice to meet you.
- You too.

156
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:09,667
- Maybe I'll see you around.
- All right. I'm always here.

157
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,895
<i>Bye.</i>

158
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:14,996
Brian, can I get a Coffee Freezer?

159
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:35,947
<i>Bring it over to the scalding tank.</i>

160
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:19,584
Amber, hon,
electric is 131 for last month.

161
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:23,489
Mom, I gotta pay my car insurance.

162
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:25,654
Well, anything helps.

163
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:27,994
So how's your day lookin'?

164
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:30,693
I have band practice after school,
then work at 6:00.

165
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:34,602
Well, don't let them
keep you past 10:00.

166
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:37,971
<i>I'll try to get out of there. Tony's been</i>
<i>pretty cool about letting me out early.</i>

167
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:41,204
Good.

168
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:20,617
Hey.

169
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,523
- <i>Hey, Amber.</i>
- Hey, David.

170
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,982
- <i>Hola.</i>
- <i>Hola.</i>

171
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:32,748
Mm-hmm.

172
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:44,892
Mm-hmm.

173
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,527
Hmm.

174
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,371
<i>And right over here, Don...</i>

175
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:58,669
we mix our product
with a low-fat product...

176
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:01,041
from about a half a dozen
other plants.

177
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:30,403
<i>The liquefied gas in the cylinder...</i>

178
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:33,909
takes 'em down
to 40 degrees below zero!

179
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,292
<i>Wow. That's a lot of Big Ones.</i>

180
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:02,464
Yeah. Well, somewhere
in Kansas City...

181
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,701
someone will be eating these
tomorrow night.

182
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:32,199
<i>...can be used to explain</i>
<i>how accidents happen to other people.</i>

183
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:35,466
<i>But accidents don't just</i>
<i>happen to other people.</i>

184
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:39,634
Accident prevention
is each individual's responsibility.

185
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:44,147
This program is designed to make you
think more about accident causes...

186
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:46,843
and how you can prevent injuries.

187
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,476
<i>If you eliminate</i>
<i>the cause of accidents...</i>

188
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:53,683
you're on your way to an accident-free
workplace and lifetime.

189
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,693
<i>Safety works in your home also.</i>
<i>It works when you're-</i>

190
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:06,259
Yo. You heard about
the robbery last night?

191
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:09,465
- No. Where?
- At the McDonald's over on Cayenne.

192
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:12,099
They came in at closing time
and put everyone in the basement.

193
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,973
<i>Said they'd get shot</i>
<i>if they came out.</i>

194
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:17,206
- And boom- 6,000 bucks.
- No way.

195
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,442
- Yeah. 6,000 in cash.
- In cash?

196
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:23,647
Hell's yeah. How many times you seen somebody
buy their McNuggets with a credit card?

197
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:26,918
- Good point.
- They said it was the third
fast-food place in Cody...

198
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:29,619
to get robbed in the last few weeks.

199
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:33,527
<i>They hit Fuddruckers on Thursday night.</i>
<i>We're probably next.</i>

200
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:35,599
All the more reason
for you guys to quit.

201
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,725
I mean, why do you even work there?

202
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,566
Not all of us can get hired
at the Banana Republic.

203
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:50,776
Yo! Fuck y'all doin' in my truck?

204
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:58,218
Mike.

205
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:17,097
Yeah, the Big One's been great.
Really great.

206
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:20,473
Sales keep creepin' up.
There's been no drop off.

207
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:22,546
That's what we're hearin'.

208
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:24,774
- I've had this location 12 years.
- Yeah?

209
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,215
And you'd have to go way back-

210
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:30,879
maybe even to the original Teeny-Weenys
promotion- to see anything like this.

211
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:34,186
- You guys hit a home run.
- Well, hey, we all did.

212
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:37,420
Definitely.

213
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:41,259
Hey, Tony, have you ever-
Have you ever been out to the U.M.P. plant?

214
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:43,891
Uh, no, I haven't.

215
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:48,130
I've been hearin' some mixed things
about the place.

216
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,872
I've heard all sorts
of nasty stuff goes on there.

217
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:54,706
You have? Like what?

218
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:59,308
I don't know. Um-

219
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,647
I used to have a friend
who used to work there...

220
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,278
and he used to tell me
all sorts of things.

221
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:07,324
Did you know that's where
the Big Ones come from?

222
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,395
This was a long time back.
I mean-

223
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,464
Look, my friend could have
been full of shit.

224
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:16,590
Yeah, 'cause I was out there.
I mean, the place is-

225
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:18,601
It's spotless.

226
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:23,072
- Yeah?
- <i>Oh, yeah. It's high-tech, state-of-the-art stuff.</i>

227
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:25,142
Stainless steel everywhere.

228
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:28,610
People wearin' gloves and clean white coats.
I mean-

229
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:30,738
Well, might be a lot different now.

230
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:40,918
So, um, the friend-You think I might
be able to give him a call?

231
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:43,016
I don't know.
He split a long time ago.

232
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,652
I haven't really talked to him.

233
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:47,924
Well- Right.

234
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:54,700
My wife's got an uncle.
He can tell you all about that place.

235
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,673
- Does he work out there?
- Oh, no, no. He used to sell 'em cattle.

236
00:32:57,775 --> 00:32:59,675
But he's a real... character.

237
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:02,177
You know, been on the ranch
a little too long.

238
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,443
You think he'd talk to me?

239
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,518
Oh, he'll talk to you.

240
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:10,815
Might scare you though.
He's a little intense.

241
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:15,120
I'll give you his number.
His name is Rudy.

242
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:28,969
Hey. Hey!

243
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:31,132
What the fuck you doin'?
What the fuck-

244
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:34,905
Are you fuckin' retarded?

245
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:43,780
Say it. "Grade 'A'." Say it.

246
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:45,856
- Grade "A."
- Thank you.

247
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:48,653
Fuckin' know you understand me.
You people act like I'm a fuckin' retard.

248
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:56,491
- <i>Sí.</i>
- Get back to work.

249
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:24,795
Coco.

250
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:17,312
Yeah, like that. Like that.

251
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:21,078
Like that.

252
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:48,769
You know, if that safe in McDonald's
was holding six grand...

253
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,280
Tony must have at least five or six
locked away in there.

254
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:55,182
Maybe more. You think he goes
to the bank every day?

255
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:57,720
That's a good question.

256
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,347
Tim says that over where he works...

257
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:02,358
that they don't even have a safe.

258
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,826
That's 'cause nobody ever eats there.

259
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,796
That chicken fajita I had the other night
was some slimy shit.

260
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:11,630
Yeah, well, there's a reason
why it only costs 99 cents.

261
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:16,529
There may be five or six grand
in Tony's safe every night...

262
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:20,236
just sittin' in there, while we're out here
gettin' paid dick to mess with this shit.

263
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,744
Yeah, no kidding.

264
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,815
And Tony's a real prick too,
you know?

265
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:26,884
I always catch him
checkin' out Amber's ass...

266
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:28,918
and he's, like, five times her age.

267
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:34,583
Hey, the cops must have these places
totally staked out at night.

268
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:38,685
'Cause they're just waitin' for another robbery.

269
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:41,731
The best time to do it would be
first thing in the morning...

270
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:43,732
around opening time.

271
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:46,701
Okay. Here's how it goes down.

272
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:48,669
We come in here
first thing in the morning.

273
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:51,037
- It's still dark, no traffic.
- Uh-huh.

274
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:53,906
Everybody's feelin' calm and sleepy.

275
00:36:57,114 --> 00:37:00,345
We'll be taking this order to go,
motherfucker.

276
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:02,715
If you got the balls, bitch.

277
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:09,552
<i>I'm supposed to go out to some ranch.</i>

278
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,026
Maybe that'll be worth something.
I don't know.

279
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:15,428
Well, I'm meetin' with Harry
on Friday.

280
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:18,468
So I should be back on Saturday.

281
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,537
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Put-Put him on.

282
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:25,541
- <i>...but the disease that spreads-</i>
- Who's this?

283
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:28,203
Hello, Stevie.

284
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:33,304
Couple of guys invited me to a party
at the "U" on Saturday night.

285
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:35,311
You wanna come?

286
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:37,574
Do they know you go to Cody?

287
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:40,480
For some reason,
they think I'm a freshman in college.

288
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:42,552
Oh, I wonder why.

289
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:45,315
One of them is really hot.

290
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:48,017
Oh, I gotta work that night.

291
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:51,026
You work way too much.

292
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:19,915
You the one that called?

293
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,083
Yeah. Hi there. I'm Don.

294
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,990
Climb on over.

295
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:36,370
- <i>Ever been out here before?</i>
- <i>Nope.</i>

296
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:39,341
It's beautiful.

297
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:41,843
You ever been on a ranch before?

298
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:46,474
Yeah, when I was a kid, at camp.

299
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:51,552
<i>How, uh- How many acres</i>
<i>do you have, Rudy?</i>

300
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:56,251
Well, you wouldn't want to have to walk
your way outta here. That's for sure.

301
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:07,930
Come on up
and meet my new neighbors.

302
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:11,269
Aw. No.

303
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:13,275
Aw, geez.

304
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:17,207
- <i>When did all this happen?</i>
- <i>Last couple of years.</i>

305
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:21,273
Local rancher lost control
of the land.

306
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:25,583
Banks took it and sold it
to real estate speculators.

307
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:40,103
What the hell happened over there?

308
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:43,605
- <i>Meth freaks.</i>
- <i>Out here?</i>

309
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:47,143
<i>They find a quiet little place,</i>
<i>start cookin'-</i>

310
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:49,804
till somethin' blows up
or burns down.

311
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:51,814
Wow.

312
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:56,580
<i>Past year and a half,</i>
<i>I've had two bodies dumped on my land.</i>

313
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:58,655
Dead bodies?

314
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:01,953
One of 'em was rolled up
in this nice-lookin' carpet.

315
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:04,027
Scared the shit out of my foreman.

316
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:07,461
<i>They dump dead dogs and cats...</i>

317
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:09,692
and all other sorts of garbage
on my land.

318
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:14,100
Seems like I spend half my time
just defendin' the place.

319
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:17,368
I gotta go to court next week...

320
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:20,842
to fight off some private
corporation from Denver...

321
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:23,379
wants to build a toll road
across my land.

322
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,813
<i>Eminent domain, my ass.</i>

323
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:29,181
They got another word for it-
robbery.

324
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,324
You wanna open that up for me?

325
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,878
You should get a clicker.

326
00:41:58,382 --> 00:42:02,682
Hey, Rudy. You know anybody
over at Uni-Globe Meat Packing?

327
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:05,755
- Sure.
- What do you think of 'em?

328
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,881
I think they're a fine bunch.

329
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:09,892
Really?

330
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:12,394
They'll slit your throat
for a nickel.

331
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:15,556
Nothin' personal.
They just want the extra nickel.

332
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:21,094
- Well, who do you know over there?
- I know all of 'em.

333
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:24,697
- I sold cattle to 'em for years.
- Oh.

334
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:27,436
More important, I know their type.

335
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,878
They are the meanest, toughest sons of bitches,
and they're proud of it.

336
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:33,541
But that's nothin' new.

337
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:38,748
My granddad went up
against the meat packers in 1919.

338
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:41,848
Testified in Congress
about their price-fixing.

339
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:45,960
And after that, none of them
would buy his cattle.

340
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:49,726
U.M.P. and all the rest
tried to run him out of the business.

341
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:52,768
- Okay, but that was a long time ago.
- Yeah.

342
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:57,637
And the big packers are even worse today.
They're even bigger today.

343
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,368
- Really?
- And meaner.

344
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:02,775
Hell, old Dwight D. Eisenhower
would've shut 'em down.

345
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,848
He wouldn't have stood
for their crap.

346
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:09,475
Do you think they would knowingly
sell us contaminated meat?

347
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,487
Oh, come on.

348
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,558
Workers are gettin'
their arms cut off over there.

349
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:16,626
You don't know
who you're dealin' with.

350
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:18,695
No. No, I don't.
Please, help me.

351
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:21,663
I- I was at the plant.
It seemed clean to me.

352
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:24,233
They show you the kill floor?

353
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:26,462
I don't know.
I saw a lot of things.

354
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:28,731
You'd remember.

355
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:32,275
You see any cattle
gettin' their heads cut off?

356
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:35,072
Were you walkin' ankle-deep in blood?

357
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:37,977
No.

358
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:41,245
So they didn't show you a damn thing.

359
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:43,912
Okay, but how-

360
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:47,957
How... would cow manure
get into the meat?

361
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,784
Rita.

362
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,656
- No, no. Thanks, I'm fine.
- You sure?

363
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:58,826
- Yes, thank you.
- I'll have some.

364
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:02,372
Hey, Rita, is your brother
still workin' over at U.M.P.?

365
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,040
How's he doin'?

366
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:12,547
Oh, he has a good job now.
He's a supervisor in Trim.

367
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,619
- Hmm.
- Mr. Anderson here would like to know...

368
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:17,687
if the meat over there is clean.

369
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,989
He wants to know how cow manure...

370
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:25,357
could ever possibly wind up
in his hamburger.

371
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:27,794
Well, there's lots of ways.

372
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:30,230
My brother used to work
at the gut table.

373
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:33,997
And, you know, they have
to pull out the intestines and the stomachs.

374
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:38,097
<i>And they just don't have enough time</i>
<i>to do it right.</i>

375
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:40,574
The line is moving too fast.

376
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:45,377
<i>So when they're pulling the guts out-</i>
<i>and they make a mistake-</i>

377
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:48,349
all the poop and stuff
just pours out all over the meat.

378
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:51,580
Okay, okay, okay.
All right.

379
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,589
But, really,
how often does that happen?

380
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:56,658
Every day.

381
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:01,493
- <i>We got any cookies back there?</i>
- I'll bring a plate of them.

382
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:03,657
Anything else you want to know?

383
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:08,534
No. No, that's, uh, plenty. Thanks.

384
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:13,608
This isn't about good people
versus bad people.

385
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,271
It's about the machine
that's taking over this country.

386
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,541
It's like somethin'
out of science fiction.

387
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:24,549
The land, the cattle, human beings.

388
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:28,518
This machine don't give a shit.

389
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:31,685
Pennies a pound.
Pennies a pound.

390
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:35,094
That's all it cares about.
A few more pennies a pound.

391
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:39,169
Sounds pretty bleak.

392
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:42,238
By the way, Don,
you seem like a nice fella.

393
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:45,274
But the food
your company sells is crap-

394
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:47,275
total crap-

395
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:49,436
even when there isn't manure in it.

396
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:18,958
Eh?

397
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:37,416
<i>Sí.</i>

398
00:47:40,424 --> 00:47:42,392
<i>Bueno.</i>

399
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:36,301
<i>Ándale.</i>

400
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:39,107
Thank God old Mr. Nathan come in.

401
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:41,207
He took one look at me.
Said, "Harry...

402
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:44,583
"you are the scariest
fucking clown I've ever seen.

403
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:48,089
<i>Take that off immediately."</i>
<i>And that was that.</i>

404
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:50,751
<i>I came about that close</i>
<i>to becoming the first Mickey.</i>

405
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:54,661
<i>Which would have been a disaster,</i>
<i>because I'd have probably killed somebody.</i>

406
00:48:55,899 --> 00:49:00,893
Mmm. What do you think?
I know it's not Mickeys.

407
00:49:01,004 --> 00:49:03,598
- Mmm.
- But it's good, right? Good burger.

408
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:06,335
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's-It's great.

409
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:12,080
- Harry, what's goin' on out at U.M.P.?
- Beg your pardon?

410
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:16,084
Yeah, what's really goin' on out there-
with the meat?

411
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:18,450
<i>You're supposed to be</i>
<i>our conduit to that place.</i>

412
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:21,786
- They didn't give you the tour?
- Yeah. Yeah.

413
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:24,326
Who took you through there?

414
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,361
Uh, Terry?

415
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:28,658
- Oh, boy.
- <i>No, no, no.</i>

416
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:30,756
He was- Listen, he was great.
He was fine.

417
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:32,835
I just-

418
00:49:32,936 --> 00:49:35,029
I've been talkin'
to a lot of people around town...

419
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:37,265
and I've been hearing
some bad things about that plant.

420
00:49:37,374 --> 00:49:40,138
<i>You know, things</i>
<i>they don't show you on the tour.</i>

421
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:44,813
Sounds like they might be running
the production line too fast, you know?

422
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:48,112
- <i>Hmm.</i>
- People are gettin' hurt out there every day.

423
00:49:48,218 --> 00:49:50,778
<i>They're gettin' cut up.</i>

424
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:52,878
One guy lost his entire arm.

425
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:56,282
<i>These poor Mexicans,</i>
<i>they come over here...</i>

426
00:49:56,393 --> 00:49:58,861
<i>and U.M.P. treats 'em like shit.</i>

427
00:49:58,962 --> 00:50:00,930
And the meat-
I gotta tell you somethin'.

428
00:50:01,031 --> 00:50:03,158
Harry, the meat is filthy.

429
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:06,531
Do you know they got untrained people
workin' at the gut table?

430
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:09,696
- Really? The gut table?
- <i>Yeah. I mean-</i>

431
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:13,640
- Harry, there's shit in our meat.
- <i>Harry.</i>

432
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:15,712
- Hi.
- Hey.

433
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:18,144
- I heard you were here today.
- How are you doin', huh?

434
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:21,547
- Ah, can't complain.
- Good. Lisa, I want you to meet Don Anderson.

435
00:50:21,651 --> 00:50:26,145
- He just came to the company from CNN.
- ESPN actually.

436
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:28,690
- Don is the inventor of the Big One.
- Really?

437
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:30,817
No. My team came up with the name.

438
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:33,919
You're just being humble.
It was pure genius, Don.

439
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,431
- It's a good name for a burger, isn't it?
- It sure is.

440
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:40,196
It's very nice to meet you.
Can I get you another Fat Tire?

441
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:42,863
I would love another Fat Tire.
You want a beer, Don?

442
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:44,873
- No, thanks.
- Just one.

443
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:47,068
- All right.
- Just one. All right.

444
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:51,911
Mmm!

445
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:00,755
You know...

446
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:04,349
I think there might be a little bit of shit
right here in this meat.

447
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:07,089
Just a teeny little bit.
Microscopic.

448
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:12,601
Your tests say that the meat
we're getting from U.M.P. is clean.

449
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:16,570
It's not. I've seen independent tests
that say that it's not.

450
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:18,732
There's always been
a little shit in the meat.

451
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:20,810
You've probably been
eatin' it your whole life.

452
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:24,472
Yeah? Well, I prefer not to, Harry.

453
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:27,846
Well, I don't know
who you been talkin' to, Don...

454
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:32,251
but there is absolutely nothing illegal
goin' on here, okay?

455
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:34,482
Meat is supposed to be cooked.

456
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:37,617
And the grills at Mickeys
are calibrated carefully...

457
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:42,926
to make sure it kills every little bit
of the bad stuff that's in there.

458
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:45,297
- That might be kinda tough
to explain to our customers.
- <i>Explain what?</i>

459
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:48,769
Listen, there is cow shit in our meat
because we're running the line too fast.

460
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:52,239
Just cook it.
That's all you need to do.

461
00:51:52,342 --> 00:51:56,369
<i>You see? That's one of the things</i>
<i>that's just buggin' me about this country.</i>

462
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,380
Really buggin' me.

463
00:51:58,482 --> 00:52:01,542
Americans have become
these-these great big fraidy cats.

464
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:05,610
Afraid of everything.
Everything's gotta be sterile and germfree.

465
00:52:05,722 --> 00:52:07,690
Well, everybody needs to grow up.

466
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:10,624
That's what they need.

467
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:13,753
You wanna be safe?
Huh? Perfectly safe?

468
00:52:13,864 --> 00:52:16,526
Well, forget about it.
That's not gonna happen. Okay?

469
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,601
Everybody just needs
to get that through their head.

470
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:22,604
Just cook the meat,
and you'll be fine.

471
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,808
I can't believe I'm hearing this.

472
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:28,571
You've known all about this?

473
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:30,646
I'm shocked.

474
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:36,877
Donny boy, you just gotta try and step back
and look at the big picture.

475
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:41,321
40,000 people die
in automobile accidents every year.

476
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:43,392
Does that mean Detroit
should stop making cars?

477
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,552
<i>Does it?</i>

478
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:48,859
<i>Of course not.</i>

479
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:50,990
You ever been down to Mexico?

480
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:53,194
- What's that have to do with anything?
- <i>It's beautiful down there.</i>

481
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:56,534
Really beautiful.
Great beaches. Gorgeous.

482
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,837
<i>But poor. Poor.</i>

483
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:02,207
<i>Poorest fuckin' place</i>
<i>I ever been, I think.</i>

484
00:53:02,312 --> 00:53:06,646
Guy down there makes three,
maybe four dollars a day.

485
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:08,650
A day, Don.

486
00:53:08,752 --> 00:53:12,017
<i>Now, that same guy,</i>
<i>he comes up here...</i>

487
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:14,522
he gets a job workin' for U.M.P.-

488
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:16,592
makin' $10 an hour.

489
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:21,995
That's more money in one day
than he makes back home in a whole month.

490
00:53:22,098 --> 00:53:25,090
So, frankly, I don't see the problem.

491
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:29,036
Nobody's makin' these people
come up here. Right?

492
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:31,664
Nobody's tellin' them
to come work for U.M.P.

493
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:34,039
- Okay, okay. But that's not the point.
- <i>And you know what?</i>

494
00:53:34,144 --> 00:53:36,135
I admire these people. Okay?

495
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:38,578
I really do.
They're hard workers.

496
00:53:38,682 --> 00:53:42,550
They're workin' hard, and they're trying
to improve their lives. Okay?

497
00:53:42,652 --> 00:53:44,620
<i>Now, isn't that</i>
<i>what our ancestors did?</i>

498
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:49,124
Isn't that what made this country
the great country that it is today? Huh?

499
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:51,194
<i>And you wanna try and stop 'em?</i>

500
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:54,320
You wanna tell 'em
that you know what's best for 'em?

501
00:53:54,431 --> 00:53:57,457
Well, most people don't like
to be told what's best for 'em.

502
00:53:57,567 --> 00:54:01,435
Well, what's goin' on
at U.M.P. is unacceptable.

503
00:54:01,538 --> 00:54:04,132
And I'm gonna have
to tell Jack about all this.

504
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,803
Oh. Gonna tell Jack, huh?

505
00:54:17,287 --> 00:54:20,120
I've been workin' for this company
almost 30 years.

506
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:22,555
Hell, I grew up right down the street
from the Nathans...

507
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:24,923
when we were all back in Muncie.

508
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:29,397
So, here's my little piece
of friendly advice to you, Donny boy.

509
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:34,659
I'd be careful
how close I got to Jack.

510
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:37,797
See, your boy Jack
is about <i>this</i> close...

511
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:40,205
to gettin' his tit
caught in the ringer.

512
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:43,336
He's under investigation, okay?

513
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:46,609
<i>Cookin' the books,</i>
<i>paddin' his expense account.</i>

514
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:50,117
Not to mention
bonin' his own secretary, okay?

515
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:53,678
- And that is not the kind of
company that we want to run.
- Louise?

516
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,690
That's right.

517
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:59,990
Your buddy Jack's got two,
maybe three months before he's out the door.

518
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:02,929
- Could be sooner.
- He's sleeping with Louise?

519
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:04,933
And you know what, Don?

520
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:07,697
You should be thankin' me
instead of doin' all this complainin'.

521
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:11,103
<i>I negotiated a hell</i>
<i>of a good price with U.M.P.</i>

522
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:15,200
Okay? I negotiated a great price
for your fuckin' meat.

523
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:19,214
Hell, if it weren't for me,
there wouldn't be no Big One, Don.

524
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,216
I'd like to see you find a supplier...

525
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,718
that will sell you Grade "A" chuck
at 40 cents a pound.

526
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,084
I'd like to see that.

527
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,682
Have-Have you ever met Louise?

528
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:32,125
Have I ever met her?

529
00:55:32,228 --> 00:55:34,696
Twenty years ago,
I gave her that job.

530
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:37,289
She was a good-lookin' woman
back then too.

531
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:45,469
<i>It is a sad fact of life, Don.</i>

532
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:48,135
But the truth is...

533
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:51,008
we all have to eat a little shit
from time to time.

534
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:54,345
But just for the record, I want you to know
that I'm with you on this.

535
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:56,851
Okay? I really am.
I'm gonna go down there.

536
00:55:56,953 --> 00:55:58,853
I'm gonna see
what the hell's goin' on.

537
00:55:58,955 --> 00:56:00,855
If I have to,
I'm gonna kick some ass.

538
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,527
You know what, Harry?

539
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:08,197
I don't think
that's gonna be good enough.

540
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:13,763
You seem like
a real bright guy, Don.

541
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:17,033
I'd hate to see you get caught up
in something you couldn't get out of.

542
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:20,309
<i>Give it some thought.</i>

543
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:25,408
Why don't you take
some of these fries home with you?

544
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:27,415
I'm not gonna finish 'em.

545
00:56:35,091 --> 00:56:38,720
No. No, it's not that simple.

546
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:43,761
There is something definitely weird
going on between Jack and Harry...

547
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:46,028
and, either way,
I can lose this job.

548
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:48,036
Either way.

549
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:54,375
No. No, we're not gonna move again.
That's-

550
00:56:54,477 --> 00:56:56,445
That's not gonna happen.

551
00:56:58,014 --> 00:57:00,073
Well, just tell Jay
to wait a moment.

552
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:03,346
This is important.
Well, have him wait!

553
00:57:08,558 --> 00:57:10,822
Yeah.

554
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:13,555
I'll- I'll talk to you later.

555
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:41,013
No, no. Look, Jack, it's gone great.

556
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:45,026
I, uh- I've been out to the plant.
I spoke to some workers.

557
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:48,222
I even tracked down
this old rancher...

558
00:57:48,331 --> 00:57:50,299
who's dealt with these guys for years.

559
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,927
So, there's a lot of things, but-

560
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:56,096
Yeah. No, of course
I met with Harry.

561
00:57:56,206 --> 00:58:00,074
Yeah. He's-He's a- interesting guy.
You were right.

562
00:58:00,176 --> 00:58:04,169
But I- I don't think that he's...
a crook.

563
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:08,150
Well, I don't know.

564
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,814
All right.

565
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:15,857
Then, uh...

566
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:18,189
I would probably recommend...

567
00:58:18,294 --> 00:58:21,388
we do some additional testing...

568
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:24,194
in the near future.

569
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,291
See what that shows.

570
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,969
Yeah.

571
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:37,205
- Will you be keeping this
on your American Express?
- Sure.

572
00:58:37,313 --> 00:58:41,283
- I have three pay-per-view movies at 7.95 each.
- Uh-huh.

573
00:58:41,384 --> 00:58:44,319
- Would you like to join
our Executive Guest Advantage program?
- No.

574
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:48,686
- Did you enjoy your stay with us?
- Not really.

575
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:51,851
- Were you here on business or pleasure?
- Business.

576
00:58:51,961 --> 00:58:55,863
Is there anything we can do in the future
to make your stay with us more enjoyable?

577
00:58:55,965 --> 00:58:58,229
You can give me my bill.

578
00:59:00,336 --> 00:59:02,463
Bye-bye, Mr. Anderson.
Have a great day.

579
