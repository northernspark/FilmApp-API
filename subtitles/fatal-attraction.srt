00:01:58,832 --> 00:02:00,060
<i>Well, there is one thing... </i>

3
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:01,765
<i>I'd like to ask you. </i>

4
00:02:01,835 --> 00:02:04,565
<i>How do they make that slime</i>
<i>they're always dumping on you? </i>

5
00:02:04,838 --> 00:02:08,001
<i>Oh, well. First, </i>
<i>they take some liquid. </i>

6
00:02:08,308 --> 00:02:11,243
<i>And then they add some</i>
<i>Jell-O powder and some flour... </i>

7
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:13,871
<i>and sometimes some soap, </i>
<i>then they dump it all over me. </i>

8
00:02:14,314 --> 00:02:17,374
You better get going, kiddo.
We're gonna be late.

9
00:02:25,258 --> 00:02:27,385
<i>Very interesting. </i>
<i>Is it always green? </i>

10
00:02:27,861 --> 00:02:31,058
<i>Yeah, it usually is, </i>
<i>but I guess it could be red. </i>

11
00:02:35,368 --> 00:02:37,097
<i>Or it could be blue. </i>

12
00:02:51,384 --> 00:02:53,511
Daddy, telephone.

13
00:02:53,887 --> 00:02:55,445
Thanks, darling.

14
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:07,957
Hello.

15
00:03:09,402 --> 00:03:11,836
Hildy, I'm fine.
I just stubbed my toe.

16
00:03:11,905 --> 00:03:13,736
Hang on one second, will you?

17
00:03:13,907 --> 00:03:15,397
Honey, it's Hildy.

18
00:03:15,876 --> 00:03:17,707
I'll call her back.

19
00:03:17,978 --> 00:03:22,347
She's in the bathroom. She wants
to know what you're wearing.

20
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:24,144
My black suit.

21
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:27,352
She's gonna wear her black dress.

22
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,446
Well, it's gonna be business.
You know how those things are.

23
00:03:31,424 --> 00:03:35,292
Ellen, I don't want you
messing with my makeup. I'm late.

24
00:03:35,428 --> 00:03:38,226
- Is her red dress okay?
- It's perfect.

25
00:03:38,431 --> 00:03:40,365
Did you hear that?
You got it.

26
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:42,628
Okay, darling.
See you later. Bye.

27
00:03:42,936 --> 00:03:44,494
Oh, man.

28
00:03:44,938 --> 00:03:49,375
I told you a million times not
to play with my lipstick, right?

29
00:03:49,442 --> 00:03:51,876
So when are you gonna
listen to me, huh?

30
00:03:51,945 --> 00:03:53,572
Silly girl.

31
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,941
Honey, where's my blue suit?

32
00:03:59,452 --> 00:04:01,181
It's on the back of the door.

33
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,392
Oh, shit.

34
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,360
Shit, shit, shit.

35
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,988
Shit, shit, shit.

36
00:04:21,474 --> 00:04:23,135
- Hi, Ellen.
- Hi, Christine.

37
00:04:23,476 --> 00:04:24,875
- How you doin'?
- Good.

38
00:04:24,978 --> 00:04:28,277
- Where's your mom?
- She's in the bathroom.

39
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:31,041
I got you a present.
Wanna see what it is?

40
00:04:33,987 --> 00:04:35,386
- Do you like it?
- Uh-huh.

41
00:04:35,488 --> 00:04:38,548
Okay, come on.
Let's go find Mommy.

42
00:04:53,506 --> 00:04:56,942
Hiya, Chuck. How are you? Good to
see you. Can you make it Friday?

43
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,774
- I'm there.
- We need you. We're in the cellar.

44
00:05:00,013 --> 00:05:01,947
Dan, is my hair okay?

45
00:05:02,015 --> 00:05:03,983
- You look great.
- I'm serious.

46
00:05:04,017 --> 00:05:05,951
You're the prettiest woman
in the room, sweetheart.

47
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:06,986
Liar.

48
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:14,686
Hiya, Bob. How are you?

49
00:05:15,028 --> 00:05:17,462
Glad you could make it, Dan.
Sorry about the meeting tomorrow.

50
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,862
I know it's a Saturday,
but we got a real crisis.

51
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:22,467
I understand. Do you know
my wife Beth? Bob Drimmer.

52
00:05:22,535 --> 00:05:24,298
- Pleased to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

53
00:05:24,537 --> 00:05:26,767
- Hope you like sushi.
- Love it, Bob.

54
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,965
- What did he do to his neck?
- He was screwin' his wife.

55
00:05:30,043 --> 00:05:32,477
- Are you serious?
- Absolutely. You should see his wife.

56
00:05:32,545 --> 00:05:34,877
They had to take her out
on a stretcher.

57
00:05:35,048 --> 00:05:38,745
- You guys are bad!
- Do you want champagne?

58
00:05:39,052 --> 00:05:40,986
- Champagne for everyone.
- With a twist.

59
00:05:41,054 --> 00:05:42,851
Four champagnes over here.

60
00:05:43,623 --> 00:05:45,523
Excuse me. Hi.

61
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,993
Thank you.

62
00:05:49,062 --> 00:05:50,791
Thank you very much.

63
00:05:52,565 --> 00:05:54,499
- Jesus!
- Thank you.

64
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:55,932
Fuck!

65
00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:58,367
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

66
00:05:58,972 --> 00:06:00,997
So, what great cultural event
are we here to celebrate tonight?

67
00:06:01,074 --> 00:06:04,532
- Some exercise manual.
- Not another one.

68
00:06:05,078 --> 00:06:06,705
This one's different.

69
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,844
It's based on
ancient samurai discipline.

70
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:13,518
Danny, look at this guy nod.

71
00:06:13,586 --> 00:06:15,577
What is that,
part of the ritual?

72
00:06:19,092 --> 00:06:20,491
Hi there.

73
00:06:24,597 --> 00:06:28,192
- Jesus! If looks could kill.
- Glad you haven't lost your touch.

74
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:30,535
I think she likes me.
I think she wants me.

75
00:06:30,603 --> 00:06:33,037
I think you're batting zero for two,
and I don't wanna know you.

76
00:06:33,106 --> 00:06:35,540
- She was undressing me with her eyes.
- You think so? Good luck, pal.

77
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:37,508
She had trouble with the buttons.

78
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:00,065
- Can I get a champagne, please?
- You got it.

79
00:07:05,638 --> 00:07:08,766
I'm not saying anything.
I'm not even gonna look.

80
00:07:09,142 --> 00:07:10,575
Was it that bad?

81
00:07:10,643 --> 00:07:14,545
I was glad I wasn't on the receiving end
of that one. Cheers.

82
00:07:14,647 --> 00:07:17,480
I hate it when guys think
they can come on like that.

83
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:18,981
Jimmy's okay.

84
00:07:19,152 --> 00:07:22,383
He's just a little insecure
like the rest of us.

85
00:07:24,157 --> 00:07:27,593
- My name is Dan Gallagher.
- Alex Forest.

86
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,185
Nice to meet you.
And what is your connection here?

87
00:07:30,663 --> 00:07:33,632
I'm an editor at Robbins and Hart.
And you?

88
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:36,601
I'm with Miller, Goodman and Hurst.
I do all your legal work.

89
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:38,899
I haven't seen you around
their office, though.

90
00:07:39,172 --> 00:07:41,902
I've just been with them
a couple of weeks.

91
00:07:50,683 --> 00:07:52,674
- I have to go.
- Is that your wife?

92
00:07:54,187 --> 00:07:55,745
Better run along.

93
00:07:56,189 --> 00:07:58,555
It was very nice to meet you.

94
00:08:08,201 --> 00:08:12,160
- Give me a break.
- Give you a break? What does this mean?

95
00:08:12,205 --> 00:08:14,969
- How many did you buy?
- What does this mean?

96
00:08:23,216 --> 00:08:25,616
- Thanks again, Christine.
- Anytime, Mrs. Gallagher.

97
00:08:25,685 --> 00:08:27,243
Good night.

98
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:38,620
Aren't you forgetting something?

99
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:50,767
Quincy, let's hit it, pal.

100
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:02,313
You're such a good boy, yes.

101
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:10,754
You did such good business.
You're the best, boy.

102
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,470
It's just for tonight, honey.

103
00:09:25,245 --> 00:09:27,975
When you first see a house,
don't show any interest at all.

104
00:09:28,248 --> 00:09:31,183
- Otherwise you can't negotiate.
- Will you stop worrying about it?

105
00:09:31,251 --> 00:09:34,550
- Ellen, are you chewing gum again?
- We can't afford it anyway.

106
00:09:34,754 --> 00:09:38,155
Look, there's no harm in looking.
It's just up the road from Mom and Dad.

107
00:09:38,758 --> 00:09:41,192
- Just another reason not to buy it.
- I didn't hear that.

108
00:09:41,261 --> 00:09:43,695
Really nothing to worry about.
We can't afford it anyway.

109
00:09:44,264 --> 00:09:47,427
Come on.
Hold on a minute, honey.

110
00:09:48,768 --> 00:09:52,033
Let's just not worry about it.
I haven't seen the damn place yet.

111
00:09:52,272 --> 00:09:54,706
I may not even like it.

112
00:09:54,774 --> 00:09:56,765
Ellen, the gum.

113
00:09:57,277 --> 00:09:59,404
Thank you.

114
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,008
Come on, Quincy.

115
00:10:02,782 --> 00:10:05,216
No, honey. Quincy's
gotta stay here with Daddy.

116
00:10:05,285 --> 00:10:07,219
- Daddy's gonna be all alone.
- Sorry, Quincy.

117
00:10:07,287 --> 00:10:09,812
- Don't forget to walk him.
- I promise.

118
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,715
You promise? Okay.
You have a good meeting.

119
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:15,317
- See you tomorrow night.
- I love you.

120
00:10:37,317 --> 00:10:40,514
<i>Two times down. Third time up</i>
<i>he looked like a jellyfish. </i>

121
00:10:44,324 --> 00:10:47,760
Sorry to ruin your weekend. Please
give my apologies to your lovely wife.

122
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:49,317
I will.

123
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,162
- So, how you feeling?
- Don't ask.

124
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,769
Henry's out of town, so I asked
Alex Forest to stand in for him.

125
00:10:56,836 --> 00:10:59,805
- Anybody know where she is?
- She's on her way.

126
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:05,107
Since we got a little time, maybe you
can tell us what happened to your neck.

127
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,544
That's cute. Very cute.

128
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,783
Sorry I'm late.
I was getting the file.

129
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:14,149
This is Alex Forest,
our new associate editor.

130
00:11:14,354 --> 00:11:16,083
We've met before.

131
00:11:16,356 --> 00:11:18,756
Okay, can we get started?

132
00:11:18,858 --> 00:11:22,294
Okay, here's the story.
You want to publish a novel...

133
00:11:22,362 --> 00:11:25,957
in which one character is a senator
from New Jersey who's foolin' around.

134
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:29,164
Now, there's a certain congressman
from Ohio...

135
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:33,296
who claims the character's based on him
and filed an injunction against this.

136
00:11:33,373 --> 00:11:35,807
The congressman's bald.
This guy has hair.

137
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,570
They're from different states.

138
00:11:38,311 --> 00:11:39,300
If we don't sell those books,
we're screwed.

139
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:43,042
If I go to court to prove this senator's
not based upon this congressman...

140
00:11:43,383 --> 00:11:45,783
then I have to know the truth.

141
00:11:45,885 --> 00:11:47,819
Now...

142
00:11:47,887 --> 00:11:50,981
strictly between these walls,
all right...

143
00:11:51,391 --> 00:11:54,724
did the author have an affair
with Mr. Ohio or not?

144
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:01,958
Yeah, she did.

145
00:12:02,402 --> 00:12:05,337
But she also had a lot of affairs
with other politicians.

146
00:12:05,405 --> 00:12:07,999
Any one of them
could make the same claim.

147
00:12:08,408 --> 00:12:10,342
She swears
this character's fictitious.

148
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,900
I just got off the phone with her.

149
00:12:12,412 --> 00:12:13,743
And you believe her?

150
00:12:14,914 --> 00:12:16,745
Yeah, I believe her.

151
00:12:18,418 --> 00:12:22,047
Now that we got that on the table,
what can we do to lift that injunction?

152
00:12:22,422 --> 00:12:25,050
If we believe the girl, is there some
way we can get to the congressman?

153
00:12:25,425 --> 00:12:27,859
They take campaign contributions.
Can we buy him off?

154
00:12:27,927 --> 00:12:32,125
Can we frighten him off? Is there
something in his past we can find?

155
00:12:32,432 --> 00:12:34,992
We need to use some leverage.

156
00:12:48,948 --> 00:12:50,848
Give me a break!

157
00:12:53,853 --> 00:12:55,252
Come on.

158
00:13:11,471 --> 00:13:14,907
- Is it made in Taiwan?
- These are tough to find.

159
00:13:14,974 --> 00:13:17,442
Oh, wait, wait. Here.
We got one.

160
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:20,969
Come on!

161
00:13:23,483 --> 00:13:25,781
You wanna go get a drink?

162
00:13:25,985 --> 00:13:27,885
Yeah, I'd love it.

163
00:13:34,494 --> 00:13:36,928
The strangest case I ever handled?

164
00:13:36,996 --> 00:13:40,488
Well, the truth was
I never actually handled it...

165
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,434
but the strangest case
I ever came near to...

166
00:13:43,503 --> 00:13:48,099
was when my parents got divorced
and my mother asked me to represent her.

167
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:51,033
- You're kidding.
- That's what I said.

168
00:13:51,444 --> 00:13:54,436
"What do you mean?" she told me.
"You know what an asshole the guy is.

169
00:13:54,514 --> 00:13:57,142
You've been a witness to this marriage
for 29 years."

170
00:13:57,517 --> 00:13:59,451
Can you believe this?
This is coming from my mother.

171
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,956
- How did you get out of it?
- You can't turn your mother down.

172
00:14:04,023 --> 00:14:06,787
So, I escaped on a technicality.

173
00:14:07,527 --> 00:14:10,496
- Which was what?
- I didn't practice family law.

174
00:14:11,364 --> 00:14:14,765
And it was true, you know,
and she bought it.

175
00:14:15,034 --> 00:14:18,231
- Are you making this up?
- Could I make something up like that?

176
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,371
Waiter.

177
00:14:25,044 --> 00:14:27,478
I've got a lot of pull here.
My favorite restaurant.

178
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:29,640
- I noticed.
- They know me well.

179
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:34,179
Miss. You want a coffee?
Can we have two coffees, please?

180
00:14:37,056 --> 00:14:39,183
Well, I'll tell you, it's...

181
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:41,993
- You want one?
- No, thank you.

182
00:14:42,595 --> 00:14:45,894
It's funny being a lawyer.
It's like being a doctor.

183
00:14:46,065 --> 00:14:48,499
Everybody is telling you
their innermost secrets.

184
00:14:48,568 --> 00:14:50,092
Oh, God.

185
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,504
You must have to be discreet.

186
00:14:52,572 --> 00:14:54,039
Oh, God, yeah.

187
00:14:54,073 --> 00:14:55,631
Are you?

188
00:14:58,578 --> 00:14:59,840
Am I what?

189
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:03,139
Discreet.

190
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:12,523
Yes, I'm discreet.

191
00:15:13,593 --> 00:15:15,151
Me too.

192
00:15:21,601 --> 00:15:24,468
- Can I ask you something?
- What?

193
00:15:24,604 --> 00:15:28,005
- Why don't you have a date tonight?
- I did have a date.

194
00:15:28,608 --> 00:15:31,577
I stood him up.
That was the phone call I made.

195
00:15:34,614 --> 00:15:36,946
Does that make you feel good?

196
00:15:38,117 --> 00:15:40,244
It doesn't make me feel bad.

197
00:15:42,622 --> 00:15:44,886
So, where's your wife?

198
00:15:45,124 --> 00:15:47,024
Where's my wife?

199
00:15:49,128 --> 00:15:53,531
My wife is in the country with
her parents, visiting for the weekend.

200
00:15:55,635 --> 00:15:58,729
And you're here with a strange girl
being a naughty boy.

201
00:15:59,138 --> 00:16:01,470
I don't think having dinner
with anybody is a crime.

202
00:16:02,141 --> 00:16:03,699
Not yet.

203
00:16:05,645 --> 00:16:07,670
Will it be?

204
00:16:08,147 --> 00:16:09,580
I don't know.
What do you think?

205
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:12,209
I definitely think
it's gonna be up to you.

206
00:16:16,656 --> 00:16:19,955
I can't say yet.
I haven't made up my mind.

207
00:16:24,664 --> 00:16:26,359
At least you're very honest.

208
00:16:29,168 --> 00:16:32,626
We were attracted to each other
at the party. That was obvious.

209
00:16:34,674 --> 00:16:37,871
You're on your own for the night.
That's also obvious.

210
00:16:42,682 --> 00:16:44,582
We're two adults.

211
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,718
Let's get the check.

212
00:18:39,298 --> 00:18:42,893
- Oh, that was great.
- Thank God.

213
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:52,209
Are you feeling energetic?

214
00:18:54,814 --> 00:18:56,782
What do you have in mind?

215
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:52,269
You live in this building?

216
00:19:58,377 --> 00:20:02,177
Well, where can I get a cab?
Do you know?

217
00:20:11,891 --> 00:20:14,655
- Have you ever done it in an elevator?
- Not recently.

218
00:20:14,894 --> 00:20:16,987
I'll bet you haven't.

219
00:22:11,443 --> 00:22:14,412
I'm sorry, baby.
I'm sorry.

220
00:22:14,446 --> 00:22:16,004
How are you?

221
00:22:24,456 --> 00:22:26,890
<i>Hi. What happened to you? </i>

222
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:30,417
<i>I tried you earlier. I'm gonna go... </i>
<i>I guess you're not back yet. </i>

223
00:22:30,462 --> 00:22:33,920
<i>I'm gonna go to bed now, </i>
<i>so call me in the morning. Bye-bye. </i>

224
00:22:54,987 --> 00:22:57,217
Oh, Dan, darling.
We were expecting you.

225
00:22:57,489 --> 00:22:58,922
<i>I had work to do. </i>

226
00:22:58,991 --> 00:23:01,892
That's a pity. We really
wanted you to see that house.

227
00:23:01,994 --> 00:23:04,963
- <i>I'll see it next time. </i>
- Of course. You wanna speak to Beth?

228
00:23:05,931 --> 00:23:07,831
<i>Hold on a second. </i>

229
00:23:10,436 --> 00:23:12,927
The phone. It's Dan.
Here you are.

230
00:23:15,441 --> 00:23:17,807
Hello.
What happened to you?

231
00:23:18,944 --> 00:23:23,108
Hi. Nothing. I just went out
and had dinner with Bill last night.

232
00:23:24,016 --> 00:23:25,643
How is he?

233
00:23:25,951 --> 00:23:30,411
He's... Bill's Bill,
the same as usual.

234
00:23:30,956 --> 00:23:32,389
<i>Is he still with that girl? </i>

235
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:34,892
Well, he wasn't last night.

236
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,428
I think it's over.
He didn't wanna talk about it.

237
00:23:38,964 --> 00:23:40,898
So, you getting any work done?

238
00:23:40,966 --> 00:23:42,160
<i>Yeah, I'm working. </i>

239
00:23:42,468 --> 00:23:45,631
There's some of the spaghetti sauce
in the refrigerator if you get hungry.

240
00:23:45,971 --> 00:23:48,439
Great. Okay.
How's Ellen doing?

241
00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:50,907
She is having the best time.

242
00:23:50,976 --> 00:23:53,706
I just hope that Dad survives it.

243
00:23:53,979 --> 00:23:57,346
Honey, I don't know
how to tell you this, but...

244
00:23:58,484 --> 00:23:59,917
she wants a rabbit.

245
00:23:59,985 --> 00:24:01,418
<i>No rabbits! </i>

246
00:24:02,387 --> 00:24:04,912
Jesus Christ! This goddamn family's
turning into Noah's ark.

247
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:08,687
I mean, please, give her a kiss,
all right? But no promises.

248
00:24:08,994 --> 00:24:10,928
- All right.
- <i>When are you coming home? </i>

249
00:24:10,996 --> 00:24:12,691
- Well, it's getting complicated.
- <i>Why's that? </i>

250
00:24:12,998 --> 00:24:14,898
There's a problem with the house.

251
00:24:15,534 --> 00:24:17,434
They sold it?

252
00:24:17,503 --> 00:24:21,439
Very funny. No, we can't get in
to see it until late this afternoon.

253
00:24:21,507 --> 00:24:24,670
I'm not up to fighting the traffic.
I thought I would come in tomorrow.

254
00:24:25,477 --> 00:24:27,274
What about school?

255
00:24:27,546 --> 00:24:30,947
She's only five years old.
What's she going to miss, trigonometry?

256
00:24:31,016 --> 00:24:34,452
Okay, all right. Then I'll see you
when I get home from work.

257
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,681
Okay. See you tomorrow.

258
00:24:37,022 --> 00:24:38,956
Okay. Thanks.
Have a good time.

259
00:24:39,024 --> 00:24:40,423
Bye.

260
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,467
What happened?

261
00:24:49,535 --> 00:24:52,436
I woke up, you weren't here.
I hate that.

262
00:24:59,044 --> 00:25:00,909
You didn't get my note?

263
00:25:01,046 --> 00:25:02,479
<i>What note? </i>

264
00:25:02,548 --> 00:25:05,346
I left you a note
right by your bed.

265
00:25:16,061 --> 00:25:18,029
That's nice.

266
00:25:18,063 --> 00:25:20,054
I thought we were gonna
spend the day together.

267
00:25:20,532 --> 00:25:23,990
Alex, I got so much work
to do today. I can't.

268
00:25:24,069 --> 00:25:26,503
<i>Why don't you just come over. </i>
<i>I'll cook us lunch. </i>

269
00:25:26,572 --> 00:25:29,166
I got to take the dog for a walk.
The poor dog has not been out all day.

270
00:25:30,108 --> 00:25:31,507
<i>I gotta take him out. </i>

271
00:25:31,577 --> 00:25:34,512
Bring the dog. I love animals.
I'm a great cook.

272
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,639
Come on.

273
00:25:37,082 --> 00:25:39,516
Listen. I'd love to, but I can't.
I really can't.

274
00:25:39,585 --> 00:25:42,053
<i>Do what you have to do, </i>
<i>then come over afterwards. </i>

275
00:25:42,087 --> 00:25:43,987
<i>We can always eat late. </i>

276
00:25:46,491 --> 00:25:49,517
Or you can work here.

277
00:25:49,595 --> 00:25:53,929
I won't disturb you, I promise.
I'll be a good girl.

278
00:25:57,102 --> 00:26:00,265
You don't give up, do you?
You just don't give up.

279
00:26:00,973 --> 00:26:02,065
Come on, Quincy.

280
00:26:21,126 --> 00:26:22,753
Help, Quincy.

281
00:26:23,128 --> 00:26:24,561
I got it. I got it.

282
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,996
He's free.
Quincy, cover me.

283
00:26:27,132 --> 00:26:29,532
I'm up. Go deep.
He fires.

284
00:26:30,135 --> 00:26:31,067
Throws.

285
00:26:31,136 --> 00:26:33,934
She got it.
Yes, it's back.

286
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:36,632
Over the head.
He's got it.

287
00:26:51,123 --> 00:26:53,557
Dan, can you hear me?

288
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:55,115
Oh, my God.

289
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:04,294
- You bastard.
- Your face.

290
00:27:06,672 --> 00:27:10,108
- That was a shitty thing to do.
- I'm sorry. I was just fooling around.

291
00:27:10,175 --> 00:27:12,541
My father died of a heart attack.

292
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:18,343
I was seven years old.
It happened right in front of me.

293
00:27:20,686 --> 00:27:22,347
Honey, I'm sorry.

294
00:27:22,688 --> 00:27:26,317
Really, I had no idea. If I did,
I never would have done that.

295
00:27:31,697 --> 00:27:33,688
What, he didn't die?
He's alive?

296
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,498
Yeah, he's alive and well
and living in Phoenix.

297
00:27:42,207 --> 00:27:44,266
You certainly got me,
didn't you?

298
00:28:03,228 --> 00:28:04,786
Let's hear it.

299
00:28:07,232 --> 00:28:10,998
I hope you like spaghetti.
Specialty of the house.

300
00:28:11,236 --> 00:28:13,466
Goes with the opera.

301
00:28:20,746 --> 00:28:22,680
It smells so good.

302
00:28:29,254 --> 00:28:31,347
- Anything else for me to do?
- No, nothing.

303
00:28:31,757 --> 00:28:34,123
Just make yourself at home.
You can change the tape.

304
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:37,524
No, this is great.
I love <i>Madame Butterfly. </i>

305
00:28:37,763 --> 00:28:40,698
Really?
It's my favorite opera.

306
00:28:40,766 --> 00:28:42,028
Mine too.

307
00:28:42,267 --> 00:28:44,497
First opera I ever saw.

308
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:49,331
My father, he took me to the old Met.
I was five years old.

309
00:28:49,775 --> 00:28:51,242
Did it make any sense?

310
00:28:51,276 --> 00:28:52,709
I got most of it.

311
00:28:52,778 --> 00:28:57,112
There was this US sailor settin' up
house with this Japanese lady.

312
00:28:59,785 --> 00:29:03,744
That was all fine,
but in the final act...

313
00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:06,019
after he left her...

314
00:29:07,793 --> 00:29:11,729
my father told me
she's gonna kill herself...

315
00:29:11,797 --> 00:29:13,765
and I was terrified.

316
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:17,030
I was... I climbed
right underneath the chair.

317
00:29:19,304 --> 00:29:20,862
It's right here.

318
00:29:22,307 --> 00:29:23,865
This is it.

319
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,878
It's funny.

320
00:29:38,323 --> 00:29:39,517
What?

321
00:29:39,825 --> 00:29:43,727
One of the only times I recall my father
being nice to me when I was a kid...

322
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:47,992
comforting me at <i>Madame Butterfly. </i>

323
00:30:23,168 --> 00:30:24,260
What?

324
00:30:26,671 --> 00:30:28,901
What are you thinking about?

325
00:30:30,675 --> 00:30:34,338
I was wondering why is it that all the
interesting guys are always married?

326
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,081
Maybe that's why you find them
interesting... you can't have them.

327
00:30:41,186 --> 00:30:43,620
How long have you been married?

328
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,555
Nine years.

329
00:30:48,226 --> 00:30:50,353
Do you have any kids?

330
00:30:50,695 --> 00:30:53,027
I got a six-year-old girl.

331
00:30:54,699 --> 00:30:56,496
Sounds good.

332
00:31:00,705 --> 00:31:02,195
I'm lucky.

333
00:31:03,708 --> 00:31:05,938
So what are you doing here?

334
00:31:14,719 --> 00:31:16,619
You know how to ask them.

335
00:31:19,224 --> 00:31:20,657
I really wanna know.

336
00:31:20,725 --> 00:31:23,694
I had a wonderful time last night.
I'd like to see you again.

337
00:31:24,229 --> 00:31:26,424
Is that so terrible?

338
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:29,325
No.

339
00:31:29,734 --> 00:31:32,430
I just don't think
it's possible, though.

340
00:31:36,241 --> 00:31:39,176
It's really strange.
I feel like I know you already.

341
00:31:40,745 --> 00:31:42,804
I just wanna know where I stand.

342
00:31:47,252 --> 00:31:49,311
I think you're terrific.

343
00:31:53,258 --> 00:31:55,158
But I'm married.

344
00:31:57,262 --> 00:31:58,524
What can I say?

345
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:05,827
Just my luck.

346
00:32:32,297 --> 00:32:33,924
Oh, shit.

347
00:32:36,801 --> 00:32:38,894
- What are you doing?
- I gotta go.

348
00:32:39,804 --> 00:32:42,238
I thought you said she wasn't
coming back till tomorrow.

349
00:32:42,307 --> 00:32:46,539
She's not, but I got things to do.
I gotta go home.

350
00:32:48,313 --> 00:32:51,043
I don't think I like this.

351
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,240
Like what?

352
00:32:53,318 --> 00:32:57,277
The way you run away
after every time we make love.

353
00:32:57,756 --> 00:33:00,748
What difference does it make
whether I leave now or in the morning?

354
00:33:00,825 --> 00:33:03,259
- The fact is I gotta go.
- You're not gonna leave now.

355
00:33:03,328 --> 00:33:05,159
- Come on. Will you stop it?
- I mean it!

356
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:06,490
Come on. Hey!

357
00:33:11,836 --> 00:33:13,667
What's the problem?

358
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,638
I'm sorry.

359
00:33:19,344 --> 00:33:22,211
Jesus Christ.
I mean, let's be reasonable.

360
00:33:22,847 --> 00:33:24,280
Be reasonable?

361
00:33:24,349 --> 00:33:25,873
What?

362
00:33:26,351 --> 00:33:28,819
"Thank you. Good-bye.
Don't call me. I'll call you."

363
00:33:28,853 --> 00:33:30,787
Look, you knew about me,
all right.

364
00:33:30,855 --> 00:33:33,187
I didn't hide anything.

365
00:33:33,358 --> 00:33:35,292
- I thought it was understood.
- What was understood?

366
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,794
The opportunity was there
and we took it.

367
00:33:37,862 --> 00:33:39,796
Come on now.
We are adults, aren't we?

368
00:33:39,864 --> 00:33:41,798
What's that supposed to mean?

369
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:44,801
- I thought we'd have a good time.
- No, you didn't.

370
00:33:44,869 --> 00:33:47,804
You thought you'd have a good time.
You didn't stop to think about me.

371
00:33:47,872 --> 00:33:50,432
That's crazy.
You knew the rules.

372
00:33:51,309 --> 00:33:52,867
What rules?

373
00:33:53,378 --> 00:33:56,313
Look. I like you.

374
00:33:56,381 --> 00:33:59,782
And if I wasn't with somebody else,
then maybe I'd be with you, but I am.

375
00:34:00,819 --> 00:34:04,084
Please don't justify yourself.
It's pathetic.

376
00:34:04,389 --> 00:34:07,483
If you told me to fuck off,
I'd have more respect for you.

377
00:34:10,895 --> 00:34:12,487
All right then. Fuck off.

378
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,299
And you get out!

379
00:34:36,421 --> 00:34:37,581
I'm going.

380
00:34:37,922 --> 00:34:42,086
Why don't you come over here
and say good-bye nicely?

381
00:34:42,427 --> 00:34:44,327
Let's be friends.

382
00:34:56,441 --> 00:34:57,999
Baby, no.

383
00:34:58,943 --> 00:35:00,501
It's okay.

384
00:35:03,381 --> 00:35:04,370
Sorry if I upset you.

385
00:35:04,449 --> 00:35:07,179
It's okay.
It's okay, really.

386
00:35:16,461 --> 00:35:18,895
It's okay. All right.
It's okay now.

387
00:35:20,965 --> 00:35:23,126
Your hands are all wet.

388
00:35:25,036 --> 00:35:25,900
Oh, Jesus!

389
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:29,064
Jesus Christ!
Come here, come here!

390
00:35:32,377 --> 00:35:34,277
Hold on, hold on.

391
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:45,012
Nice and tight.

392
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:59,291
Hi. Did you just call me?

393
00:37:00,064 --> 00:37:04,330
I was in the shower and I heard
the phone. I thought it was you.

394
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:08,538
So how are you?
Did you have a good day?

395
00:37:14,512 --> 00:37:16,480
Really?

396
00:37:17,015 --> 00:37:19,449
That's terrific.
That's really terrific.

397
00:37:19,517 --> 00:37:21,417
You sound excited.

398
00:37:27,525 --> 00:37:31,461
No, I'm not against the idea.
Don't get me wrong.

399
00:37:31,529 --> 00:37:33,429
It's just the money.

400
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:46,242
Okay, darling.

401
00:37:46,311 --> 00:37:47,869
I love you.

402
00:37:49,314 --> 00:37:50,713
Bye.

403
00:38:19,344 --> 00:38:21,244
How are you feeling?

404
00:38:24,349 --> 00:38:26,579
Okay.

405
00:38:28,853 --> 00:38:30,844
I gotta go.

406
00:38:32,323 --> 00:38:34,689
Will you call me sometime?

407
00:38:35,326 --> 00:38:37,487
You don't have to
if you don't want to.

408
00:38:37,829 --> 00:38:39,763
No, I want to.

409
00:38:39,831 --> 00:38:43,130
You promise me
you're gonna go see the doctor.

410
00:38:53,745 --> 00:38:55,144
Good-bye.

411
00:39:00,251 --> 00:39:02,185
You take care.

412
00:39:02,253 --> 00:39:03,652
You too.

413
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:33,979
Shit.

414
00:39:34,252 --> 00:39:37,187
Look what I got.
Look what I got for you here?

415
00:39:37,255 --> 00:39:40,053
A little spaghetti and meat sauce.
That's it, buddy.

416
00:39:40,258 --> 00:39:42,692
We'll make an Italian out of you yet.
That's a good boy.

417
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,228
All right.
Have a good one.

418
00:40:04,282 --> 00:40:06,546
What are you doing here?
It's 8:00 a.m.

419
00:40:07,285 --> 00:40:10,721
I'm in the shitter, Martha. I gotta be
in court by 2:00 and I'm really behind.

420
00:40:10,788 --> 00:40:15,020
Do me a favor. Cancel everything
and call Drimmer. Tell him we're fine.

421
00:40:15,293 --> 00:40:18,558
- I'll be there by 2:00.
- At 2:00? Okay.

422
00:40:18,796 --> 00:40:20,696
Good morning, Martha.

423
00:40:27,004 --> 00:40:29,996
- Daddy!
- Hey, honey! Oh, God, I missed you.

424
00:40:30,308 --> 00:40:34,540
We had a great time. We went for a walk
with Grandpa and saw rabbits.

425
00:40:34,812 --> 00:40:37,474
Well, good. Why don't you slow down.
I can't understand a word you're saying.

426
00:40:37,815 --> 00:40:39,749
- Daddy, I want a rabbit.
- I know you do, honey.

427
00:40:39,817 --> 00:40:42,513
- Hi, darling. How are you?
- Good.

428
00:40:49,827 --> 00:40:51,761
Oh, God, I missed you.

429
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:54,195
Liar.

430
00:40:54,332 --> 00:40:55,890
I did.

431
00:40:57,835 --> 00:41:00,065
I should go away more often.

432
00:41:11,315 --> 00:41:13,283
- I did this one.
- You did?

433
00:41:13,351 --> 00:41:16,286
- Pick another one.
- I thought it was this row you picked.

434
00:41:16,354 --> 00:41:19,448
- It was this one.
- I think you're in a lot of trouble.

435
00:41:27,365 --> 00:41:29,424
Phooey. I can't do it.

436
00:41:39,343 --> 00:41:41,436
Now pick a card, Dad.

437
00:41:41,846 --> 00:41:44,713
Any card at all?

438
00:41:44,849 --> 00:41:46,407
- Of course.
- Where'd she learn this?

439
00:41:46,851 --> 00:41:48,751
Grandpa showed me.

440
00:41:50,855 --> 00:41:52,413
It's a surprise.

441
00:41:56,861 --> 00:41:58,089
So, how was it?

442
00:42:00,865 --> 00:42:03,766
Come on. I'm a big boy.
I can take it.

443
00:42:04,869 --> 00:42:07,394
It had a place for rabbits.

444
00:42:07,872 --> 00:42:11,000
Oh, no! She said it.
She said the "R" word.

445
00:42:12,877 --> 00:42:15,937
Not rabbits? Rabbits?

446
00:42:21,385 --> 00:42:24,149
Well, what can I tell you?
It's absolutely perfect.

447
00:42:24,388 --> 00:42:26,379
In this row?

448
00:42:27,892 --> 00:42:31,828
So, when are you gonna come up
and take a look at it?

449
00:42:31,896 --> 00:42:34,194
- Just for the hell of it?
- In this row?

450
00:42:35,399 --> 00:42:37,594
How about tomorrow morning?

451
00:42:38,402 --> 00:42:41,132
- Daddy, which row?
- You mean it?

452
00:42:41,405 --> 00:42:44,135
If you can get me back
to the office by 1:00, yeah.

453
00:42:44,408 --> 00:42:46,342
Which row, Dad?

454
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:48,503
It's in this row, sweetheart.

455
00:43:15,439 --> 00:43:16,872
Honey?

456
00:43:16,941 --> 00:43:19,000
Honey, come here.
I want you to see this.

457
00:43:24,949 --> 00:43:26,382
Well?

458
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:29,351
Well, it's... it's okay.

459
00:43:30,955 --> 00:43:32,388
What do you mean?
It's fantastic.

460
00:43:32,456 --> 00:43:33,980
It's great.

461
00:43:34,458 --> 00:43:37,894
Just think of all the money
we're gonna save not living in New York.

462
00:43:37,962 --> 00:43:40,988
The local high school is excellent.
My own children went there.

463
00:43:41,465 --> 00:43:44,400
- You see?
- This is a terrific area for kids.

464
00:43:44,468 --> 00:43:46,698
I'm sure it is.
Is it okay if I go upstairs?

465
00:43:46,971 --> 00:43:49,872
- Go ahead. I'll wait for you down here.
- Thank you.

466
00:43:52,476 --> 00:43:54,410
You know,
we still gotta decorate.

467
00:43:54,478 --> 00:43:57,345
We can fix up anything.
We can have painting parties.

468
00:43:57,481 --> 00:44:00,609
Painting parties?
Beth, you're making me very nervous.

469
00:44:07,491 --> 00:44:10,289
Now look at this.
This is fantastic.

470
00:44:11,495 --> 00:44:13,963
This would make a terrific playroom.

471
00:44:14,498 --> 00:44:17,934
What are you talking about playroom?
This is my den. It's a den.

472
00:44:18,002 --> 00:44:20,470
I knew you were gonna like it.

473
00:44:23,007 --> 00:44:25,032
I like it.

474
00:44:37,521 --> 00:44:39,455
I'll be in court.
How you doing, Dan?

475
00:44:39,523 --> 00:44:41,718
Hi, Eunice.
Did Martha get back from lunch?

476
00:44:42,026 --> 00:44:44,927
- She just returned.
- Thank you.

477
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,100
This isn't a bad time, is it?
I was in the area.

478
00:44:59,543 --> 00:45:02,239
No. No. You...
Do you wanna come in my office?

479
00:45:17,561 --> 00:45:20,826
You gonna be in your office later?
There's a little something... Excuse me.

480
00:45:21,065 --> 00:45:23,499
- Haven't we met somewhere?
- I don't think so.

481
00:45:23,567 --> 00:45:26,127
She looked at me first.

482
00:45:29,573 --> 00:45:31,131
Sit down.

483
00:45:45,589 --> 00:45:47,887
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

484
00:45:48,092 --> 00:45:50,390
I was gonna call you today.

485
00:45:57,601 --> 00:46:00,502
This is terribly embarrassing.

486
00:46:00,604 --> 00:46:05,041
I just wanted to say sorry
for what happened.

487
00:46:05,109 --> 00:46:07,669
I had no right
to put you through that.

488
00:46:10,614 --> 00:46:12,548
Nothing happened, okay?

489
00:46:13,117 --> 00:46:16,951
I was going through a bad time
and everything was coming to a crisis.

490
00:46:17,621 --> 00:46:21,421
But I'm fine. I'm really all right.
And thank you.

491
00:46:22,126 --> 00:46:25,493
- You don't have to thank me.
- Oh, yeah, I do.

492
00:46:25,596 --> 00:46:28,030
A lot of guys
would have just run away.

493
00:46:28,632 --> 00:46:31,760
I don't know what I would have done
if you hadn't been there.

494
00:46:33,137 --> 00:46:36,436
Well, you... you look good.

495
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,904
As a matter of fact,
you look great.

496
00:46:39,543 --> 00:46:40,942
Thanks.

497
00:46:43,147 --> 00:46:45,479
So that's past?

498
00:46:49,687 --> 00:46:52,588
- May I ask you one more favor?
- What's that?

499
00:46:54,158 --> 00:46:57,958
I've got two tickets
to <i>Madame Butterfly... </i>

500
00:46:58,162 --> 00:47:00,995
two weeks from Thursday.

501
00:47:01,165 --> 00:47:04,965
I'd really love it if you'd come
with me, kind of as a peace offering.

502
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:09,503
That's... That's very nice of you...

503
00:47:11,175 --> 00:47:13,166
but I don't think it's a good idea.

504
00:47:13,744 --> 00:47:15,507
No strings attached.

505
00:47:17,214 --> 00:47:20,149
You don't have to explain.
I just thought I'd ask.

506
00:47:22,686 --> 00:47:24,085
So...

507
00:47:28,192 --> 00:47:30,160
I'll see you around sometime.

508
00:47:47,211 --> 00:47:48,371
Come here.

509
00:47:53,717 --> 00:47:55,582
Take care.

510
00:47:55,719 --> 00:47:57,414
Good-bye.

511
00:48:27,751 --> 00:48:29,412
Let's go, pal!

512
00:48:29,753 --> 00:48:32,483
We're on a roll.
We're on a roll.

513
00:48:40,764 --> 00:48:42,129
I like it.

514
00:48:42,233 --> 00:48:43,165
Very nice.

515
00:49:01,285 --> 00:49:03,150
That is no good.

516
00:49:31,815 --> 00:49:34,181
How about Rodgers
versus whatchamacallit?

517
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:37,287
- Winitsky.
- Right. I got your memo.

518
00:49:37,321 --> 00:49:39,619
- You gonna go for summary judgment?
- Why not, Arthur?

519
00:49:39,823 --> 00:49:43,350
The facts are not in dispute. Rodgers
admits reading Winitsky's article.

520
00:49:43,827 --> 00:49:46,261
The question is whether
he plagiarized it in his book.

521
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:49,561
You can't copyright an idea,
only the expression of the idea...

522
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:53,269
and Rodgers sure as hell didn't use
any of the words in the book.

523
00:49:53,337 --> 00:49:55,271
Let me think about it.

524
00:49:55,339 --> 00:49:57,637
So, I hear you're about
to become a suburbanite.

525
00:49:57,841 --> 00:49:59,775
We're gonna take the big plunge.

526
00:49:59,843 --> 00:50:02,334
- Got a buyer for the apartment?
- No.

527
00:50:02,846 --> 00:50:05,781
- Got cold sweats about your escrow?
- Yeah.

528
00:50:05,849 --> 00:50:08,283
But not about Rodgers
versus Winitsky?

529
00:50:08,352 --> 00:50:10,616
- No, sir.
- Good.

530
00:50:11,422 --> 00:50:13,652
He's still in a meeting.

531
00:50:13,857 --> 00:50:17,088
Yes, I know. I did expect him
to be through by now.

532
00:50:21,365 --> 00:50:23,833
I'd like you to have lunch with me
on Tuesday, if you're around.

533
00:50:23,867 --> 00:50:26,392
Thank you, Arthur. That'd be great.
Let me just check my diary.

534
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:29,805
You are on his list of calls.
It's Alex Forest.

535
00:50:29,873 --> 00:50:33,309
Again? I thought you told her
I'd call her back.

536
00:50:33,377 --> 00:50:35,311
- I did.
- Put her on hold.

537
00:50:35,379 --> 00:50:37,176
Would you mind holding?

538
00:50:37,381 --> 00:50:39,815
- Tuesday would be great.
- I look forward to it.

539
00:50:39,883 --> 00:50:41,783
Thank you. I will too.

540
00:50:43,887 --> 00:50:45,115
Put her through.

541
00:50:54,898 --> 00:50:58,026
Look, Alex, I thought we agreed
this was not a good idea.

542
00:51:01,905 --> 00:51:03,304
Why?

543
00:51:07,411 --> 00:51:09,311
I'm sorry.
I thought you understood.

544
00:51:09,413 --> 00:51:12,348
If I misled you in some way,
I apologize.

545
00:51:12,416 --> 00:51:15,715
But I don't think it's a good idea
if we talk to each other anymore.

546
00:51:15,919 --> 00:51:17,318
Okay?

547
00:51:18,922 --> 00:51:20,321
Good-bye.

548
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:29,126
If she calls again,
tell her I'm not here.

549
00:51:29,433 --> 00:51:30,991
Thank you.

550
00:52:16,713 --> 00:52:18,442
Wait. Let me do something.

551
00:52:18,715 --> 00:52:20,774
Let me just look at you.

552
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:25,449
You're so beautiful.

553
00:52:25,722 --> 00:52:27,986
You're just so beautiful.

554
00:52:40,737 --> 00:52:43,103
- Wouldn't you know.
- I know.

555
00:52:55,719 --> 00:52:57,516
Do you know how many injuries can...

556
00:52:57,721 --> 00:52:59,655
- That's my wife!
- Don't terrorize them.

557
00:52:59,723 --> 00:53:02,191
I'm a lawyer. I'm insured.

558
00:53:02,726 --> 00:53:04,626
Oh, it's excited.

559
00:53:04,695 --> 00:53:06,595
Now don't forget who gave you this.

560
00:53:06,697 --> 00:53:09,131
My cold sores are almost gone.

561
00:53:09,233 --> 00:53:11,895
This is for you. Ladies first.
I use that term advisedly.

562
00:53:13,737 --> 00:53:15,170
You bet, sweetie.

563
00:53:15,239 --> 00:53:18,572
That's my wife!
A little attention, please.

564
00:53:18,742 --> 00:53:21,176
Ladies. Gentleman.

565
00:53:21,245 --> 00:53:23,713
My wife.
My little ball and chain.

566
00:53:23,747 --> 00:53:26,682
- You should have such a ball and chain.
- Mother of some of my children.

567
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:31,187
- Wouldn't be that confident about it.
- Here is to Miller, Goodman...

568
00:53:31,255 --> 00:53:33,621
Hurst and Gallagher.

569
00:53:34,758 --> 00:53:37,192
- Here's to Mrs. Gallagher.
- Give me a break, will you, guys?

570
00:53:37,261 --> 00:53:39,126
All he did was ask me to lunch.

571
00:53:39,263 --> 00:53:42,164
Your moving to your country estate.
You'll forget you ever knew us.

572
00:53:42,266 --> 00:53:44,700
Wait a minute.
I read one of those self-help books.

573
00:53:44,768 --> 00:53:47,066
Published by Robbins and Hart,
of course.

574
00:53:47,271 --> 00:53:49,296
<i>Samurai Self-Help. </i>

575
00:53:55,279 --> 00:53:58,180
In it, it tells you how to deal
with the anxieties of your friends...

576
00:53:58,282 --> 00:54:01,581
as you move up the corporate ladder
and they stay put...

577
00:54:01,785 --> 00:54:03,184
or, God forbid, go down.

578
00:54:03,287 --> 00:54:07,417
And in this book, it tells you
not to coddle your friends' anxieties.

579
00:54:07,758 --> 00:54:10,727
So I'm not gonna make
any false reassurances, guys.

580
00:54:10,794 --> 00:54:13,592
I'm not gonna tell you you're gonna be
up to the house every weekend.

581
00:54:13,797 --> 00:54:17,198
Let's face it. Things have changed.
This is not a classless society.

582
00:54:18,302 --> 00:54:21,203
As a matter of fact, this is it.
Good-bye. Good-bye.

583
00:54:21,305 --> 00:54:24,240
I knew he was gonna say that.
The man is running true to form.

584
00:54:24,308 --> 00:54:26,503
Honey, I think we gotta make
a clean break.

585
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:29,506
We're on a roll.
We gotta travel light.

586
00:54:29,813 --> 00:54:31,781
Thanks for the time you've given us.

587
00:54:39,823 --> 00:54:43,088
Here, you, drink. I want you
with a lamp shade on your head by 10:00.

588
00:54:43,327 --> 00:54:46,125
Why should today be any different
from any other?

589
00:54:52,836 --> 00:54:54,394
Here's to you.

590
00:55:50,394 --> 00:55:53,659
Yeah, Richards.
It's kind of late, isn't it?

591
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:00,597
If you refuse to take my phone calls
at the office, you leave me no choice.

592
00:56:01,405 --> 00:56:05,341
It's 2:00 in the morning.
Can't this wait till tomorrow morning?

593
00:56:05,409 --> 00:56:07,240
Is it awkward for you to talk?

594
00:56:09,413 --> 00:56:11,745
You could say that.

595
00:56:12,916 --> 00:56:14,349
I've gotta see you.

596
00:56:14,418 --> 00:56:16,147
I don't have the...

597
00:56:17,421 --> 00:56:21,118
the documentation to answer that right
now, but I'll call you from the office.

598
00:56:21,925 --> 00:56:26,726
No. Meet me in front of the Robbins
and Hart building tomorrow, 6:00.

599
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:29,694
Don't disappoint me.

600
00:56:29,933 --> 00:56:31,366
Be there.

601
00:56:38,275 --> 00:56:41,642
- This has gotta stop.
- If you saw me, I wouldn't call.

602
00:56:41,945 --> 00:56:44,379
Do you get it? It's over.
There's nothing between us.

603
00:56:44,448 --> 00:56:47,383
You mean you've had your fun.
Now you just want a quiet life.

604
00:56:47,451 --> 00:56:49,316
- Why are you doing this?
- Doing what?

605
00:56:49,453 --> 00:56:51,353
- You need help.
- Don't tell me what I need.

606
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:53,389
You need a shrink!

607
00:56:53,457 --> 00:56:55,789
Why are you so hostile?
I'm not your enemy.

608
00:56:55,959 --> 00:56:59,417
- Then why are you trying to hurt me?
- I'm not. I love you.

609
00:56:59,463 --> 00:57:01,556
- You what?
- I love you.

610
00:57:03,467 --> 00:57:06,027
- You don't even know me.
- How can you say that?

611
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:08,370
We spent a weekend together,
that's all.

612
00:57:08,472 --> 00:57:10,406
You stayed that second night.
You must like me a little.

613
00:57:10,474 --> 00:57:14,069
Because I was concerned about you.
Why do you read so much into everything?

614
00:57:14,478 --> 00:57:17,914
Can't you understand? I have
a whole relationship with someone else.

615
00:57:17,981 --> 00:57:19,380
I am very happy.

616
00:57:19,483 --> 00:57:21,451
Whole means complete.

617
00:57:21,985 --> 00:57:23,919
If your life's so damn complete,
what were you doing with me?

618
00:57:23,987 --> 00:57:27,889
- Is that what you wanna talk about?
- I'm pregnant.

619
00:57:32,496 --> 00:57:35,260
I saw my gynecologist on Monday.

620
00:57:35,499 --> 00:57:37,592
Here's his card.
You can call him.

621
00:57:44,508 --> 00:57:45,873
You don't...

622
00:57:48,011 --> 00:57:49,911
Use anything?

623
00:57:51,014 --> 00:57:54,848
I had a very bad miscarriage last year.
I didn't think I could get pregnant.

624
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:59,614
How do you know it's mine?

625
00:58:01,525 --> 00:58:04,517
Because I don't sleep around.

626
00:58:15,539 --> 00:58:17,097
I apologize.

627
00:58:19,543 --> 00:58:21,704
I'm sorry.

628
00:58:22,045 --> 00:58:24,479
Don't worry. You're not gonna
have to handle this alone.

629
00:58:24,548 --> 00:58:26,880
Handle what?

630
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:30,213
The abortion. I'll take care of it.
I'll pay for it.

631
00:58:31,054 --> 00:58:33,284
What makes you think
I want an abortion?

632
00:58:38,061 --> 00:58:39,995
You're not gonna have the baby.

633
00:58:40,063 --> 00:58:41,894
Why not?

634
00:58:42,065 --> 00:58:44,465
There are plenty
of one-parent families.

635
00:58:44,568 --> 00:58:48,004
- At least they don't end in divorce.
- I don't have a say in this?

636
00:58:48,071 --> 00:58:50,733
I want this child.

637
00:58:51,074 --> 00:58:55,010
It has nothing to do with you. I want it
whether you're a part of it or not.

638
00:58:55,078 --> 00:58:58,980
Then why are you telling me?
Why not just go ahead and do it?

639
00:59:02,085 --> 00:59:04,485
I was hoping that you would want
to be a part of it.

640
00:59:06,089 --> 00:59:08,922
This is crazy.
This is totally insane.

641
00:59:09,092 --> 00:59:12,289
I'm 36 years old. It may be
my last chance to have a child.

642
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:19,694
Just think what you're saying.

643
00:59:20,103 --> 00:59:22,037
Just think about it.

644
00:59:22,105 --> 00:59:26,940
We are gonna live with this
for the rest of our lives.

645
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:29,010
I know that.

646
00:59:30,614 --> 00:59:32,548
I've thought of that.
I know how you feel.

647
00:59:32,616 --> 00:59:36,575
It's a big thing,
but it doesn't have to be a problem.

648
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:38,679
Really, it doesn't.

649
00:59:39,122 --> 00:59:42,114
You play fair with me,
I'll play fair with you.

650
00:59:48,632 --> 00:59:51,499
"He led Agnes and Nellie
into the hall closet and shut the door.

651
00:59:51,568 --> 00:59:54,662
Agnes and Nellie and Oink giggled
and laughed in the dark.

652
00:59:55,071 --> 00:59:57,005
Pearl listened outside the door.

653
00:59:57,073 --> 00:59:58,904
'Oh, it works, ' cried Nellie.

654
00:59:59,075 --> 01:00:00,542
'Of course, ' said Oink.

655
01:00:00,577 --> 01:00:02,511
'Look at the flying dog, '
yelled Agnes.

656
01:00:02,579 --> 01:00:04,274
'Wow! ' cried Nellie.

657
01:00:05,015 --> 01:00:08,280
Pearl frowned. 'Who cares
about flying dogs? ' she said.

658
01:00:08,518 --> 01:00:10,486
Nobody heard her.

659
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,454
'Look out for the worms! '
squealed Agnes.

660
01:00:12,522 --> 01:00:14,854
'Eeek! ' yelled Nellie
and Agnes together.

661
01:00:15,025 --> 01:00:18,188
'Look at the monster cockroach! '
yelled Oink.

662
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:21,554
'Help!"'

663
01:03:03,159 --> 01:03:06,094
So you know what I did?
I called the doctor.

664
01:03:06,162 --> 01:03:08,562
You know what he says?
"Congratulations."

665
01:03:08,665 --> 01:03:11,793
I can't even imagine
what she told him.

666
01:03:12,135 --> 01:03:14,695
Anyway, that's not the end of it.

667
01:03:15,672 --> 01:03:18,140
After I talk to the doctor...

668
01:03:18,174 --> 01:03:21,405
this morning
I broke into her apartment.

669
01:03:21,678 --> 01:03:24,909
I know. Me, a lawyer,
breaking and entering.

670
01:03:25,181 --> 01:03:28,116
I'm looking for something, anything to
get a handle on what I'm dealing with.

671
01:03:28,184 --> 01:03:32,086
I thought maybe I could find out
she was sleeping with somebody else.

672
01:03:32,188 --> 01:03:34,713
Well, I didn't find anything.

673
01:03:39,195 --> 01:03:41,959
Anyway, I didn't find anything.

674
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:46,635
Jimmy, I don't know anything
about family law.

675
01:03:46,703 --> 01:03:49,831
You gotta help me.
What kind of case does she really have?

676
01:03:54,711 --> 01:03:56,736
It ain't good.

677
01:03:58,214 --> 01:04:00,114
She keeps calling the apartment.

678
01:04:01,718 --> 01:04:04,243
Every time Beth answers the phone,
she hangs up.

679
01:04:06,723 --> 01:04:09,556
I'm scared, Jimmy. I...

680
01:04:09,726 --> 01:04:11,853
I don't wanna lose my family.

681
01:04:18,735 --> 01:04:23,172
<i>The facts, as alleged, </i>
<i>are horrendous. </i>

682
01:04:23,239 --> 01:04:26,106
<i>The instrument allegedly used</i>
<i>in all three cases... </i>

683
01:04:26,242 --> 01:04:28,904
<i>was an electronic shock device</i>
<i>or stun gun... </i>

684
01:04:29,305 --> 01:04:35,355
