00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:40,726
I used to think a wedding
was a simple affair.

3
00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:43,963
Boy and girl meet.
They fall in love. He buys a ring.

4
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:46,699
She buys a dress.
They say, "I do."

5
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,607
I was wrong.
That's getting married.

6
00:02:52,741 --> 00:02:56,879
A wedding is an entirely
different proposition.

7
00:02:56,979 --> 00:03:00,150
I know.
I've just been through one.

8
00:03:00,284 --> 00:03:02,719
Not my own,
my daughter's--

9
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,124
Annie Banks-MacKenzie.

10
00:03:06,257 --> 00:03:09,562
That's her married name--
MacKenzie.

11
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:14,134
I'll be honest with you.

12
00:03:14,267 --> 00:03:18,306
When I bought this house 17 years ago,
it cost less than this blessed event...

13
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:22,111
in which Annie Banks
became Annie Banks-MacKenzie.

14
00:03:22,211 --> 00:03:24,747
I'm told that one day
I'll look back on all this...

15
00:03:24,848 --> 00:03:28,451
with great affection
and nostalgia.

16
00:03:28,586 --> 00:03:31,755
I hope so.

17
00:03:31,856 --> 00:03:34,159
You fathers will understand.

18
00:03:34,292 --> 00:03:37,230
You have a little girl...

19
00:03:37,363 --> 00:03:40,199
an adorable little girl
who looks up to you...

20
00:03:40,334 --> 00:03:44,071
and adores you in a way
you could never have imagined.

21
00:03:44,205 --> 00:03:49,544
I remember how her little hand
used to fit inside mine...

22
00:03:49,677 --> 00:03:53,349
how she used to lover to sit on my lap
and lean her head against my chest.

23
00:03:53,482 --> 00:03:56,487
She said I was her hero.

24
00:03:56,621 --> 00:03:58,623
Then the day comes when she wants
to get her ears pierced...

25
00:03:58,723 --> 00:04:01,894
and wants you to drop her off a block
before the movie theater.

26
00:04:02,027 --> 00:04:05,197
Next thing you know, she's
wearing eye shadow and high heels.

27
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,902
From that moment on
you're in a constant state of panic.

28
00:04:09,035 --> 00:04:11,739
You worry about her going out
with the wrong kind of guys...

29
00:04:11,872 --> 00:04:14,543
the kind of guys
who only want one thing.

30
00:04:14,676 --> 00:04:16,611
And you know exactly
what that one thing is...

31
00:04:16,745 --> 00:04:19,080
because it's the same thing you wanted
when you were their age.

32
00:04:20,883 --> 00:04:22,852
Then she gets a little older...

33
00:04:22,985 --> 00:04:25,924
and you quit worrying about her
meeting the wrong guy...

34
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,893
and you worry about her
meeting the right guy.

35
00:04:29,027 --> 00:04:32,932
And that's the biggest fear
of all because...

36
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:37,004
then you lose her.

37
00:04:37,104 --> 00:04:40,575
And before you know it, you're sitting
all alone in a big, empty house...

38
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:45,747
wearing rice on your tux,
wondering what happened to your life.

39
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:49,552
It was just six months ago
that it happened here.

40
00:04:49,652 --> 00:04:53,791
Just six months ago
that the storm broke.

41
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,430
Annie had been studying
for her masters in architecture...

42
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:00,566
for the past semester in Rome.

43
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,137
I remember I was at work,
walking through the factory.

44
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:07,241
I own a company called Sidekicks.
We manufacture athletic shoes.

45
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:10,145
Anyway, I remember
how preoccupied I was that day.

46
00:05:10,278 --> 00:05:12,748
- I'm sorry, Mr Banks.
- My fault, Grace.

47
00:05:12,882 --> 00:05:17,320
Annie had never been that far away from
home, and she was due back any minute.

48
00:05:17,454 --> 00:05:19,990
I couldn't wait
to see the kid.

49
00:05:22,827 --> 00:05:26,131
George, she landed.

50
00:05:26,265 --> 00:05:28,801
My daughter has been studying abroad,
been flying for 11 hours.

51
00:05:28,968 --> 00:05:31,604
I'm not wild about her being
in the air. You have kids, Juan.

52
00:05:31,704 --> 00:05:34,475
You understand. It's-It's better
when they're on the ground.

53
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,682
I've always been
a concerned parent.

54
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:44,188
I'm big on car seats,
seat belts, bedtimes, curfews...

55
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,357
calling when you get somewhere,
never running with a sharp object.

56
00:05:47,492 --> 00:05:49,694
- Hi, George.
- What can I say? I'm a father.

57
00:05:49,828 --> 00:05:53,097
- Worrying comes with the territory.
- Is Nina picking her up at the airport?

58
00:05:53,198 --> 00:05:54,300
- Yeah.
- And you're gonna meet them?

59
00:05:54,466 --> 00:05:56,135
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm going home right now.

60
00:05:56,268 --> 00:05:58,138
I, uh-- My keys are--

61
00:05:58,305 --> 00:05:59,306
- Here.
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.

62
00:05:59,472 --> 00:06:01,409
- And sign this.
- Okay.

63
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:07,182
- Hat.
- Okay, thanks. Now-- Oh!

64
00:06:09,986 --> 00:06:11,321
- Okay. Bye.
- Bring her by.

65
00:06:12,856 --> 00:06:16,293
I left work early because I had
a little something to pick up
for Annie's homecoming.

66
00:06:18,897 --> 00:06:23,436
We live in a small town in
Southern California called San Marino.

67
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:25,972
I love this town, and not
just because it's the kind of place...

68
00:06:26,072 --> 00:06:28,141
where people still
smile at each other...

69
00:06:28,308 --> 00:06:31,779
- Bye.
- but because it hasn't changed much
in the past 25 years.

70
00:06:31,913 --> 00:06:35,985
And since I'm not a guy who's big on
change, this town fits me like a glove.

71
00:06:40,724 --> 00:06:43,094
I got Annie's ten-speed
all cleaned up and polished.

72
00:06:43,261 --> 00:06:46,265
New seats, new tyres.
I couldn't wait to show it to her.

73
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:53,039
This is our house.
24 Maple Drive.

74
00:06:53,206 --> 00:06:55,642
Annie was just in grammar school
when we bought it.

75
00:06:55,808 --> 00:06:59,713
A few years later, we got
a surprise package-- our son Matt.

76
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,551
I love this house.
I love that I taught my kids...

77
00:07:02,717 --> 00:07:04,620
to ride their bikes
in the driveway.

78
00:07:04,787 --> 00:07:07,456
I love that I slept with them
in tents in the backyard.

79
00:07:07,623 --> 00:07:11,261
I love that we carved our initials
in the tree out front.

80
00:07:11,428 --> 00:07:13,597
This house is warm in the winter,
cool in the summer...

81
00:07:13,765 --> 00:07:16,101
and looks spectacular
with Christmas lights.

82
00:07:16,268 --> 00:07:20,006
It's a great house,
and I never want to move.

83
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:22,275
But the think I think
I like best about this house...

84
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,078
are the voices I hear
when I walk through the door.

85
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:27,583
- Hey. Hi. You got out early.
- Hi.

86
00:07:27,683 --> 00:07:29,985
- Where is she?
- Oh, she's, uh, unpacking.

87
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:34,858
She looks-- She looks so fabulous,
just fabulous. Different.

88
00:07:34,991 --> 00:07:37,795
- Anyway, she can't wait to see you.
- Different.

89
00:07:37,928 --> 00:07:40,231
- Ciao, Papa.
- Hey.

90
00:07:40,331 --> 00:07:42,334
Annie brought me this candy bar
all the way from Rome.

91
00:07:42,467 --> 00:07:44,603
Let's not get it
on our American furniture.

92
00:07:44,703 --> 00:07:47,306
Matty. The high tops.

93
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:53,114
- Hey, grazie.
- Hey, you're welcome.

94
00:07:53,248 --> 00:07:57,419
- What do you mean, different?
- Oh.

95
00:08:03,693 --> 00:08:07,164
- Annie.
- Hi, Dad.

96
00:08:07,832 --> 00:08:11,136
Hey, hey, hey!

97
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:14,841
- God, I missed you.
- You look all lit up inside.

98
00:08:14,974 --> 00:08:17,877
Oh, I feel
all lit up inside.

99
00:08:18,011 --> 00:08:20,814
- Maybe we should go to Rome
for a few months, honey.
- Oh, you two would love it.

100
00:08:20,915 --> 00:08:23,651
It's the most romantic place
on Earth.

101
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:27,290
- You smell pretty good too.
- Oh, you like it? It was a present.

102
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:30,327
Doesn't she look incredible?
I almost didn't recognize her.

103
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:34,499
Come on. Dinner's on the stove.
Honey, you wanna come?

104
00:08:34,632 --> 00:08:37,702
Oh, Mom, I had this pasta in Florence.
I forget what it's called.

105
00:08:43,209 --> 00:08:44,878
All right. Now that
we're all back under one roof...

106
00:08:45,011 --> 00:08:47,648
we have some very important items
to discuss.

107
00:08:47,748 --> 00:08:51,118
First on the list: Who wants to go
to the Laker game on Thursday?

108
00:08:51,252 --> 00:08:53,922
- Oh.
- Me. Definitely yes.

109
00:08:54,056 --> 00:08:55,424
Okay, and with
your busy schedule too.

110
00:08:55,558 --> 00:08:57,694
Honey, I can't. I have
inventory to do that night.

111
00:08:57,794 --> 00:09:01,097
- Aw.
- Uh, Thursday, sure. Absolutely.

112
00:09:01,231 --> 00:09:04,501
- Okay.
- Matty, could you use your fork?

113
00:09:04,602 --> 00:09:07,807
Number two: Paul Simon
is coming to the Forum...

114
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,876
and I think I can
get us great seats.

115
00:09:09,976 --> 00:09:15,350
- Um, yeah, sure.
- All right. Paul Simon's
an "um, yeah, sure..."

116
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,785
which I believe
translates to a yes?

117
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:20,521
- All right. I'll call that guy.
- Um, honey?

118
00:09:20,622 --> 00:09:22,625
Could you please get that
bottle of wine in the fridge for me?

119
00:09:22,758 --> 00:09:25,896
- Sure.
- Dad, wait. Um, I don't know.

120
00:09:25,996 --> 00:09:29,834
- You don't want to see Paul Simon?
- No, I-I do. It's just, um--

121
00:09:29,967 --> 00:09:31,235
- Well, what is it?
- Well--

122
00:09:31,369 --> 00:09:33,705
- Honey, is something going on?
- Yes.

123
00:09:33,805 --> 00:09:38,110
Yeah, it is, Mom. Uh-- God, this is
a hard thing to tell parents.

124
00:09:38,243 --> 00:09:41,282
Especially when they're
my parents. Oh, God.

125
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,150
Honey, just say it.
What's the big deal?

126
00:09:43,284 --> 00:09:45,653
- Yeah.
- Okay.

127
00:09:48,491 --> 00:09:52,762
I met somebody in Rome.
Um, he's an American.

128
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:57,034
Uh, he's from L.A., actually,
and, um, his name's Bryan MacKenzie.

129
00:09:57,167 --> 00:10:01,172
And he's this
completely wonderful...

130
00:10:01,306 --> 00:10:05,144
wonderful, amazing man, and--

131
00:10:05,277 --> 00:10:08,048
Well, we, we started
seeing each other...

132
00:10:08,181 --> 00:10:11,451
a lot, and, um...

133
00:10:11,585 --> 00:10:13,521
we fell in love.

134
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:16,491
It actually happened.
And, uh...

135
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:22,032
we've decided to get married
which means that I'm engaged!

136
00:10:22,165 --> 00:10:25,169
I'm engaged!
I'm getting married!

137
00:10:27,338 --> 00:10:31,176
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

138
00:10:31,309 --> 00:10:33,479
Well, my, my.

139
00:10:33,613 --> 00:10:37,551
Oh, so-- Oh, my. And that's
your engagement ring, huh?

140
00:10:37,684 --> 00:10:41,256
Yes, yes! We got it
at a flea market outside of Rome.

141
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:45,527
The guy we bought it from said
it was at least 100 years old.

142
00:10:45,661 --> 00:10:49,900
- Wow.
- So, Dad. Stop it. Say something.

143
00:10:52,636 --> 00:10:54,205
I-I'm sorry.
What did you say?

144
00:10:54,338 --> 00:10:57,242
Dad, I met a man in Rome,
and he's wonderful...

145
00:10:57,376 --> 00:11:00,712
and brilliant,
and we're getting married.

146
00:11:02,816 --> 00:11:05,419
- Mom, what's he doing?
- George.

147
00:11:06,653 --> 00:11:09,024
George, what is it?

148
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:15,131
Well. This is-- This--

149
00:11:15,264 --> 00:11:17,568
This is ridiculous.

150
00:11:17,701 --> 00:11:20,304
- What?
- You're-- You're-- You're
too young to get married.

151
00:11:20,438 --> 00:11:23,575
Too young? Dad, I'm 22.
If I'm not mistaken...

152
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:26,378
that's, that's a year older
than Mom was when you guys got married.

153
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:29,748
- That is absolutely not true.
- Oh, no, you-- Ha!

154
00:11:29,882 --> 00:11:31,718
You're absolutely wrong.

155
00:11:31,851 --> 00:11:34,622
- You were this age when I married you?
- No! I was younger.

156
00:11:34,755 --> 00:11:38,126
I was this age
when she was born.

157
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,629
That-- That-- That doesn't matter.
Times have changed.

158
00:11:40,762 --> 00:11:45,468
You mother was mature, and, uh,
22 isn't what it used to--

159
00:11:45,602 --> 00:11:49,340
Matty, would you turn on
the air conditioner? It's hot in here.

160
00:11:49,473 --> 00:11:51,642
I thought-- I thought you didn't
believe in marriage.

161
00:11:51,776 --> 00:11:54,347
I thought that it meant
that a woman lost her identity.

162
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,983
I-I thought you wanted to get a job
before you settled down...

163
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,318
so you could earn money
and be your own person.

164
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,121
All right. Hold on.

165
00:12:01,255 --> 00:12:04,659
I didn't think I believed
in marriage until I met Bryan.

166
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:06,828
And Bryan's not like any other guy
I've ever known.

167
00:12:06,961 --> 00:12:08,897
I want to be married to him.

168
00:12:08,998 --> 00:12:11,668
And I'm not gonna lose
my identity with him...

169
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:15,373
because he's not
some overpowering, macho guy.

170
00:12:15,506 --> 00:12:19,645
I mean, he's like you, Dad,
except he's brilliant.

171
00:12:19,778 --> 00:12:23,116
He happens to love the fact
that I want to be an architect.

172
00:12:23,216 --> 00:12:26,386
He wants me to design
a house for us to live in.

173
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:29,490
He said he'd move
anywhere I got a job.

174
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,559
Give me a little credit, George.

175
00:12:31,693 --> 00:12:34,629
I'm not gonna marry some ape
who wants me to wear...

176
00:12:34,729 --> 00:12:36,999
go-go boots and an apron.

177
00:12:37,133 --> 00:12:40,871
I'm telling you you'll love him.
He's a genius.

178
00:12:41,004 --> 00:12:42,973
And sweet.

179
00:12:43,106 --> 00:12:48,146
And I-- I love him more
than anything in the world.

180
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:50,983
- What does Bryan do?
- Who's Bryan?

181
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:59,026
- I forgot his name!
- He's an independent
communications consultant.

182
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,430
- Independent?
- Yes.

183
00:13:01,562 --> 00:13:06,135
Yeah. That's code for "unemployed." This
is perfect. You meet an unemployed...

184
00:13:06,302 --> 00:13:09,706
amazingly brilliant non-ape
that I'm going to have to support.

185
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,544
I suppose I'm going to have to hire him
and fire some hard-working guy...

186
00:13:12,676 --> 00:13:15,146
with three kids
because my son-in-law--

187
00:13:15,246 --> 00:13:18,751
the, the independent
communications consultant--

188
00:13:18,918 --> 00:13:20,987
can't get a job anywhere else.

189
00:13:21,087 --> 00:13:24,591
No wonder he'll move
anywhere you get a job.

190
00:13:24,758 --> 00:13:27,695
You're not getting married,
and that's it, and that's final.

191
00:13:27,795 --> 00:13:31,332
And I don't like you calling me George.
I mean, when did this start?

192
00:13:31,432 --> 00:13:33,469
Daddy, what is wrong with you?

193
00:13:40,478 --> 00:13:42,613
What? You're telling me
you're happy about this ?

194
00:13:42,747 --> 00:13:44,783
George, please, will you stop
acting like a lunatic father...

195
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,387
and go out and talk to her
before she runs out that door...

196
00:13:47,553 --> 00:13:49,656
marries this kid
and we never see her again?

197
00:13:53,827 --> 00:13:55,797
All right.

198
00:13:57,265 --> 00:14:00,503
"Kid." How do you know he's a kid?
He could be 45 years old.

199
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,426
An independent
communications consultant...

200
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:23,631
does not mean
he's an unemployable non-ape.

201
00:14:23,798 --> 00:14:27,302
Bryan happens to be
a computer genius.

202
00:14:27,469 --> 00:14:30,406
Companies send him all over the world
hooking up these complex systems.

203
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,510
Major banks and corporations
send him to, to Tokyo...

204
00:14:33,644 --> 00:14:35,279
and Brazil and Geneva.

205
00:14:35,412 --> 00:14:37,115
I mean, he's--
He's a genius.

206
00:14:37,248 --> 00:14:41,320
You mentioned that.
How old is this genius?

207
00:14:41,454 --> 00:14:44,791
Twenty-six, not forty-five.

208
00:14:44,891 --> 00:14:47,861
You guys still think I can't hear you
when you're one room away.

209
00:14:51,967 --> 00:14:54,803
If you love him so much,
I know I'll love him too.

210
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,881
- Bryan?
- Mackenzie.

211
00:15:04,015 --> 00:15:06,385
Bryan MacKenzie.

212
00:15:06,518 --> 00:15:08,720
- Yeah.
- I can't wait to meet him.

213
00:15:08,854 --> 00:15:12,058
Good, 'cause he'll be here
in an hour to meet you.

214
00:15:14,161 --> 00:15:16,697
I suppose you're not in the mood
for a little one-on-one?

215
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:20,368
- Daddy, I'm wearing heels.
- Come to the right place.

216
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:30,714
I've got sunshine

217
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,052
On a cloudy day

218
00:15:36,188 --> 00:15:40,126
When it's cold outside

219
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,863
I've got the month of May

220
00:15:44,865 --> 00:15:47,803
-He's got it behind the back. The crowd
is going wild. The crowd is going wild.
-I guess

221
00:15:47,936 --> 00:15:50,272
- It's-- It's--
- You say

222
00:15:50,405 --> 00:15:54,812
What can make me feel this way

223
00:15:54,945 --> 00:15:58,215
My girl, my girl
my girl

224
00:15:58,349 --> 00:16:01,619
- Talking about my girl
- Hey!

225
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:07,626
My girl, ooh-ooh

226
00:16:16,805 --> 00:16:19,174
Hey, hey, hey

227
00:16:21,478 --> 00:16:23,914
- Hey, hey, hey
- Yes.

228
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:27,986
- Dad!
- Yes!

229
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,822
Oh, traveling!

230
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:34,927
I don't need no money

231
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:38,499
Fortune or fame

232
00:16:40,035 --> 00:16:44,506
I got all the riches, baby

233
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,176
- This is it. Eight up.
- One man can claim.

234
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,577
- Go.
- Ready?

235
00:16:49,646 --> 00:16:52,316
Well, I guess

236
00:16:52,449 --> 00:16:54,652
- You'll say
- Hold on.
- No!

237
00:16:54,786 --> 00:16:59,425
- What can make me feel this way
- Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
No, no, no, no. No!

238
00:16:59,525 --> 00:17:02,895
My girl, my girl
my girl

239
00:17:03,028 --> 00:17:05,800
- Talking about my girl
- Yes!

240
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,237
My girl
Talking about my girl

241
00:17:09,371 --> 00:17:12,174
- I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
- All right.

242
00:17:12,307 --> 00:17:15,011
With my girl

243
00:17:15,144 --> 00:17:16,847
I've even got the month of May

244
00:17:16,981 --> 00:17:18,481
You're not really getting married,
are you?

245
00:17:18,614 --> 00:17:20,985
Dad, stop!

246
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:35,570
- So can you see him?
What does he look like?
- He just drove up.

247
00:17:36,571 --> 00:17:39,540
And?

248
00:17:39,674 --> 00:17:42,278
He drove too fast.

249
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,965
Well, wait. So, George,
you want to meet him?

250
00:17:59,098 --> 00:18:01,902
Do I want to meet him?

251
00:18:09,044 --> 00:18:12,616
- Oh, hello. Hi.
- Hello, I'm Brian MacKenzie.

252
00:18:12,748 --> 00:18:15,252
Good. I'm Nina Banks.

253
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,555
Yes. Yes, I recognize you
from your picture.

254
00:18:17,689 --> 00:18:19,591
- Yes, come in, please.
- The one Annie had with her in Rome.

255
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:24,763
- Yes. Oh, good. Come in.
- Okay. Hello, Mr Banks.

256
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:28,034
It was the first time I ever
hated the sound of my own name.

257
00:18:28,134 --> 00:18:31,173
- Hi.
- I've heard so much about you.

258
00:18:31,305 --> 00:18:33,475
It's great
to finally meet you, sir.

259
00:18:33,608 --> 00:18:37,180
"Sir." Two words
now crossed my mind:

260
00:18:37,313 --> 00:18:39,182
"brown" and "nose."

261
00:18:39,315 --> 00:18:43,120
Annie talks about you so much,
I feel like I already know you.

262
00:18:43,253 --> 00:18:46,156
- Bryan.
- Oh, Annie.

263
00:18:55,936 --> 00:18:59,007
- So this is him.
- Oh, he's just-- Uh, just.

264
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:02,310
A little nervous. Just like one
of those situations you read about...

265
00:19:02,443 --> 00:19:05,280
you know,
meeting the in-laws.

266
00:19:05,381 --> 00:19:09,152
But you two seem great. I'm sure
I have nothing to be nervous about.

267
00:19:09,285 --> 00:19:11,622
But, uh, still, I--

268
00:19:11,756 --> 00:19:14,125
Let's, let's, uh, uh,
go into the, uh, uh, the, uh--

269
00:19:14,225 --> 00:19:16,528
The-- uh-- Great.

270
00:19:16,661 --> 00:19:18,931
- I think he's adorable.
- I don't like him.

271
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:22,503
- Oh, George, for God--
- He's wearing Nikes.

272
00:19:25,806 --> 00:19:28,410
- Mom, where's Matty?
- Oh, he fell asleep watching TV.

273
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:32,181
- Oh, well, you'll meet him tomorrow.
- Okay.

274
00:19:32,314 --> 00:19:34,250
- Sit down.
- So.

275
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:37,688
Um, how did you two, uh, meet?

276
00:19:37,822 --> 00:19:42,427
Oh. We were the only two people
at this revival house in Rome...

277
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,530
for a midnight showing
of Bringing Up Baby.

278
00:19:45,664 --> 00:19:48,268
- We kept hearing each other laugh.
- And at all the same places.

279
00:19:48,401 --> 00:19:50,970
Yeah. When it was over,
I picked him up.

280
00:19:51,137 --> 00:19:53,006
Oh, no, no, no. I went over
to you to ask directions...

281
00:19:53,139 --> 00:19:56,444
and then one thing
led to another and--

282
00:19:56,577 --> 00:19:58,714
And that was it.
For the next three months...

283
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,816
we never left
each other's sight.

284
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:04,887
We went to all these museums,
all these great concerts, the opera.

285
00:20:05,054 --> 00:20:08,459
We traveled to the country. Remember
that place we stayed in Tuscany?

286
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,429
Oh, with the, uh--

287
00:20:11,563 --> 00:20:14,467
- Uh, suffice it to say,
it was not a four-star hotel.
- No.

288
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,569
You have a very brave daughter.

289
00:20:18,872 --> 00:20:21,843
Bryan, um, what is it exactly
that you do?

290
00:20:21,943 --> 00:20:24,579
Annie was saying
something about computers.

291
00:20:24,712 --> 00:20:27,950
Uh, yes, uh, I'm an independent
communications consultant.

292
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,885
Yeah, yeah,
that part I heard.

293
00:20:30,018 --> 00:20:32,288
Sounds fake, right?
Like it's not a real job?

294
00:20:32,455 --> 00:20:34,859
- No, we wouldn't say that. No.
- That's what my dad said...

295
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:36,595
when he first heard
what I was doing.

296
00:20:36,762 --> 00:20:40,032
But, um, what it is,
uh, in this case:

297
00:20:40,132 --> 00:20:42,034
Uh, Pacific International Bank
sent me to Rome to hook up...

298
00:20:42,134 --> 00:20:44,505
the X-Dot connection
to their European subsidiary.

299
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:49,476
Um-- Uh, all European computers, uh,
communicate on the Dot 25 network.

300
00:20:49,643 --> 00:20:51,846
And, uh, since Pacific International
is an L.A.-based firm...

301
00:20:52,046 --> 00:20:56,252
they wanted to interface with standard
European protocol, so I set 'em up.

302
00:20:58,422 --> 00:21:02,460
And, uh, why are you, uh, independent?
What was that?

303
00:21:02,627 --> 00:21:05,763
Because no one can afford
to keep him on staff.

304
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:10,070
Well, I guess that's true,
basically, but, uh--

305
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:14,407
You know, driving down here,
I tried to put myself in your place.

306
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,777
Your daughter comes home
after spending four months in Rome...

307
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:19,346
a-and I'm sure you couldn't wait
to see her, and she shocks you...

308
00:21:19,513 --> 00:21:21,850
with the news
that she's getting married.

309
00:21:22,017 --> 00:21:24,020
And to somebody
you've never met before.

310
00:21:24,187 --> 00:21:26,656
I'm sure that
must've been pretty...

311
00:21:26,823 --> 00:21:29,860
um, heavy...

312
00:21:30,027 --> 00:21:33,030
to use a word
from your generation.

313
00:21:33,197 --> 00:21:35,968
I just wanna say
that I'm an upstanding citizen.

314
00:21:36,135 --> 00:21:38,037
I've-I've never been
engaged before.

315
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:41,908
I've, uh, never really
been in love before.

316
00:21:42,042 --> 00:21:46,481
And, uh, I think Annie's
the greatest person I've ever met.

317
00:21:46,581 --> 00:21:49,151
And I can't wait
to marry her and...

318
00:21:49,284 --> 00:21:52,755
one day have children
and grandchildren.

319
00:21:55,692 --> 00:21:59,997
And I'm gonna do my best
to be supportive of her dreams.
And she's a very gifted architect.

320
00:22:00,131 --> 00:22:03,335
Um-- I'm just thrilled
that I met her.

321
00:22:06,739 --> 00:22:08,709
I love your daughter.

322
00:22:08,842 --> 00:22:13,747
And the feelings that I have for her
are never gonna change.

323
00:22:13,881 --> 00:22:17,186
And I'm here to stay.

324
00:22:17,318 --> 00:22:19,855
- Oh, honey.
- Mom.

325
00:22:24,027 --> 00:22:25,962
I'm so happy for you.

326
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:28,233
That's okay, Mr Banks,
We don't have to hug.

327
00:22:28,366 --> 00:22:30,769
- Well, uh, maybe later.
- I know.

328
00:22:30,903 --> 00:22:35,375
Well, that was just, um--
That was just the best thing
I've ever heard anybody say.

329
00:22:37,077 --> 00:22:39,380
- Oh. Good.
- Well, I meant it.

330
00:22:39,512 --> 00:22:41,883
Listen, I want to take Bryan out
for a drive, show him around San Marino.

331
00:22:41,983 --> 00:22:44,386
- Okay, honey. Good.
- Annie, it's a little nippy out.

332
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:46,789
- You might want to put on a sweater.
- Oh, Dad, it's okay. I'm kinda warm.

333
00:22:46,922 --> 00:22:48,524
Still, there's a chill in the air,
and you've been on a plane.

334
00:22:48,624 --> 00:22:50,927
- Dad, I'm fine.
- Annie, it is kinda cold out.

335
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,062
- It is?
- Yeah.

336
00:22:52,196 --> 00:22:55,800
- All right, thanks. I'll get my jacket.
- All right.

337
00:22:55,934 --> 00:22:59,972
Right then, I realized
my day had passed.

338
00:23:00,106 --> 00:23:03,543
She'll always love me, of course,
but not in the same way.

339
00:23:03,643 --> 00:23:06,680
I was no longer the man
in my little girl's life.

340
00:23:06,813 --> 00:23:09,383
I was like an old shoe,
the kind we manufacture...

341
00:23:09,484 --> 00:23:13,655
and get all excited about and then
after a few years discontinue.

342
00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:18,128
That was me now:
Mr Discontinued.

343
00:23:18,261 --> 00:23:20,998
Mom? Don't wait up, okay?
We might stop for a cappuccino.

344
00:23:21,132 --> 00:23:23,435
Oh, okay, fine.
Well, good night, Bryan.

345
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,771
Good night.
Um, good night, Mr Banks.

346
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:28,140
Oh, you can call him George,
or Dad.

347
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:30,878
- George will be fine.
- Okay. Uh--

348
00:23:31,011 --> 00:23:33,480
I'll say it next time I see you.

349
00:23:33,614 --> 00:23:37,519
Drive carefully, and don't forget
to fasten your condom.

350
00:23:37,652 --> 00:23:39,421
- Dad!
- Seat belt!

351
00:23:39,521 --> 00:23:42,358
I meant-- I meant
seat belt.

352
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:46,897
Um, I'm putting your father to bed.
This has been a very big night for him.

353
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,800
- Bye.
- Okay.
- Well, good night.

354
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,300
- Have fun.
- Bye.
- Good night.

355
00:23:50,435 --> 00:23:53,138
- Bye.
- Bye-bye. Have fun.
- Bye.

356
00:23:55,841 --> 00:23:58,445
This is a great kid.

357
00:23:58,545 --> 00:24:01,181
- It'll never last.
- Wanna bet?

358
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:03,684
Nina, Annie's much too spirited
for this kid.

359
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:07,322
He's totally wrong for her.
I give it two months, tops. One month.

360
00:24:07,456 --> 00:24:10,359
This is the right guy for Annie, George.
I'm telling you, I feel it in my bones.

361
00:24:10,493 --> 00:24:12,628
- I mean, we're two lucky parents.
We are.
- Lucky? Oh!

362
00:24:12,728 --> 00:24:15,732
What about his laugh? It was such
a giveaway. It was so phoney with his--

363
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,003
- I thought it was totally sincere.
- Oh, please.

364
00:24:19,104 --> 00:24:21,907
What about that little rehearsed speech
he gave? It was right out of a book.

365
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:24,043
How To Grease Your Future
Mother-In-Law.

366
00:24:24,176 --> 00:24:27,647
You're off here, George,
really. I thought it was
completely from his heart.

367
00:24:27,747 --> 00:24:29,951
- Why do you think I cried?
- Good question.

368
00:24:30,084 --> 00:24:32,553
I don't know why either of you cried.
I'm losing my voice.

369
00:24:32,687 --> 00:24:35,824
- Are my glands swollen or something?
- Let me see. No. No, honey, no.

370
00:24:35,924 --> 00:24:37,761
And what about
the way he kept touching her?

371
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:40,263
- What do you mean?
- What do you mean what do I mean?

372
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,565
- He could-- He couldn't
keep his hands off her.
- Oh, yes. Kind of like...

373
00:24:42,699 --> 00:24:46,237
when we were engaged, except that
wasn't all you couldn't keep off me.

374
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:49,441
That was different.
And we certainly never
acted that way in your parents' house.

375
00:24:49,574 --> 00:24:53,112
Ah! You want me to name all the rooms
we did it in at my parents' house?

376
00:24:53,246 --> 00:24:55,916
That was different.
We were like two imbeciles.

377
00:24:56,049 --> 00:24:58,752
- This is our child we're talking about.
- Our child? Oh, George.

378
00:24:58,887 --> 00:25:02,892
You know, I still think you see Annie
as a seven-year-old in pigtails.

379
00:25:02,992 --> 00:25:04,726
Well, you know, that just shows
how much you know about me...

380
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,297
because that is not at all
how I see her.

381
00:25:07,431 --> 00:25:10,133
Right, a seven-year-old
with pigtails.

382
00:25:10,267 --> 00:25:13,237
I mean, here's the thing: We have
no idea who this Bryan really is.

383
00:25:13,337 --> 00:25:16,174
- Oh. Uh-huh.
- I mean, if that's his real name.
I mean, who knows?

384
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:19,812
You know, maybe he already has a wife.
You read about these cases every day--

385
00:25:19,945 --> 00:25:23,783
you know, men who have wives and
families stashed all across the country.

386
00:25:23,917 --> 00:25:26,954
I mean, he could be a professional
con artist who meets innocents abroad...

387
00:25:27,087 --> 00:25:31,827
and gives them this song and dance about
being an independent whatever that was.

388
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,031
And then skips out after bilking them
for all they're worth.

389
00:25:35,164 --> 00:25:37,934
- Wh-What are you doing?
- I'm getting ready for bed.

390
00:25:38,035 --> 00:25:40,939
You know, then I suppose you're not
interested that I believe
I remember seeing someone...

391
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:43,608
who looked like Bryan's twin
on America's Most Wanted.

392
00:25:43,741 --> 00:25:46,979
You're right.
I'm not.

393
00:25:47,113 --> 00:25:49,381
George.

394
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:51,485
George, I-I thought he was great.

395
00:25:51,618 --> 00:25:53,988
I liked him a lot.
And I'm really ha-- Ann--

396
00:25:54,122 --> 00:25:57,759
George, will you please stop making
that face? I'm very happy for Annie.

397
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,395
I'm excited for her.
This is a big deal.

398
00:26:00,529 --> 00:26:04,200
I think that we should
at least hug.

399
00:26:04,334 --> 00:26:06,970
This is great news.

400
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:09,039
Oh, a wedding.

401
00:26:11,476 --> 00:26:14,613
Father of the bride.
Can you believe it?

402
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:27,029
Forty-eight hours later,
the wedding was still on...

403
00:26:27,163 --> 00:26:30,499
and we were on our way to Bel-Air
to meet Bryan's folks.

404
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:33,003
I don't know why we have to have
brunch with total strangers.

405
00:26:33,136 --> 00:26:37,341
Because their son is marrying
our daughter and it's not
an unusual custom meeting the in-laws.

406
00:26:37,441 --> 00:26:40,879
You know, that's another thing.
I hate that expression: in-laws.

407
00:26:41,013 --> 00:26:44,450
What does it mean anyway?
We're legally bound to these people?

408
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:48,689
I don't wanna be "in-lawed," especially
to people who live in Bel-Air.

409
00:26:48,823 --> 00:26:52,461
I mean, what kind of people
have brunch and live in Bel-Air?

410
00:26:52,594 --> 00:26:54,997
Rich people.

411
00:26:55,163 --> 00:26:59,368
They probably live in the one shack
in the middle of all these mansions.

412
00:26:59,469 --> 00:27:02,407
- Nice mood, George.
- What? I'm in a good mood.

413
00:27:07,011 --> 00:27:10,048
Okay, I think this is it.
Yeah.

414
00:27:12,853 --> 00:27:15,922
- Nice shack, babe.
- Worse. It's the biggest house
on the street.

415
00:27:16,057 --> 00:27:19,627
Now we're related to
pretentious snobs. Just what we need.

416
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:45,994
You look very handsome, George,
way too young to be in-lawed.

417
00:27:46,161 --> 00:27:49,932
Well, it really shouldn't matter
how I look. We're not here
to win their approval.

418
00:27:51,934 --> 00:27:53,703
Just because you
changed your outfit five times.

419
00:27:53,837 --> 00:27:55,705
Oh, and you didn't try on
nine different shirts?

420
00:27:55,906 --> 00:27:57,175
- Two.
- Two.

421
00:27:57,341 --> 00:27:59,076
Two long-sleeve,
two short-sleeve.

422
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:02,680
- Hi!
- George, Nina, welcome.

423
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,249
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- I'm John.

424
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:07,620
- How do you do?
- Hi, I'm Joanna.

425
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,123
- Welcome. Come in, please.
- Welcome to our house. Come on in.

426
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:12,159
- Come in.
- Thank you so much. Well.

427
00:28:12,326 --> 00:28:16,097
All I could think about
was the size of this place.

428
00:28:16,264 --> 00:28:18,701
We could've parked our whole house
in the foyer.

429
00:28:18,868 --> 00:28:22,539
Ah, what a nerve-racking thing,
meeting your future in-laws.

430
00:28:22,706 --> 00:28:24,842
- Yeah.
- What a relief. You two
look perfectly normal.

431
00:28:25,008 --> 00:28:28,646
Oh, well, I am.

432
00:28:28,813 --> 00:28:31,649
I have to tell you,
we got so nervous about today...

433
00:28:31,749 --> 00:28:35,421
about meeting the two of you,
I-I must've tried
on three different outfits.

434
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:38,526
- Oh.
- I changed my shirt four times.

435
00:28:38,693 --> 00:28:43,331
- Can you imagine anyone
being that jerky?
- Oh, I know.

436
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:45,367
So, come on in. I thought
we'd have lunch in here.

437
00:28:45,501 --> 00:28:48,004
- Oh, what a great room.
- Marta.
- Thank you, Marta.

438
00:28:48,137 --> 00:28:52,776
Marta, estos son nuestros in-laws,
George and Nina Banks.

439
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:54,879
- Hello.
- How do you do? Hi.

440
00:28:55,012 --> 00:28:58,683
Oh, and here's
the rest of our family.

441
00:28:58,783 --> 00:29:02,722
Oh, don't worry. They look like killers,
but they're actually quite friendly.

442
00:29:02,855 --> 00:29:05,759
As long as you're relaxed,
why, they're relaxed.

443
00:29:05,893 --> 00:29:08,795
Hi, puppy, puppy, puppy.
Why, you're--

444
00:29:08,929 --> 00:29:12,067
All right, fellas, that's enough.
Go on. Release! Good boys.

445
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,103
- Well, why don't we all sit down.
- Please.

446
00:29:14,236 --> 00:29:16,372
- Oh, thank you.
- All right. Here we go.

447
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:19,743
- George. Honey.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

448
00:29:19,876 --> 00:29:22,580
I don't know if the kids told you, but
we were over in Europe on business...

449
00:29:22,713 --> 00:29:25,049
and we stopped in Rome
to see Bryan.

450
00:29:25,184 --> 00:29:28,620
So we got to spend a few days
with Annie. Oh, boy!

451
00:29:28,754 --> 00:29:31,958
- We just fell in love
with her immediately.
- Isn't she great?

452
00:29:32,091 --> 00:29:34,261
Yes. We just couldn't
be happier about this.

453
00:29:34,395 --> 00:29:37,132
How did you, uh,
take the news, George?

454
00:29:37,265 --> 00:29:39,234
Me?

455
00:29:39,367 --> 00:29:43,439
Uh, truthfully, uh, I was
a little surprised.

456
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:46,676
- I was shocked.
- So was I.

457
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:49,379
After all, they'd only known each other
a few months.

458
00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:52,083
Exactly. And Annie's
just finishing up school.

459
00:29:52,217 --> 00:29:54,385
Absolutely. Oh, believe me,
I tossed and turned over this one...

460
00:29:54,485 --> 00:29:57,456
but the bottom line
is they're in love.

461
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:00,327
They're over 21, and whether they're
rushing into this or not...

462
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,697
may be not for us to say.

463
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:06,502
Right. "Not for us to say."
We're only their parents.

464
00:30:06,635 --> 00:30:09,705
I was about to say these very words
out loud when he hit me with--

465
00:30:09,838 --> 00:30:12,709
Yeah, sooner or later,
you just have to let your kids go...

466
00:30:12,842 --> 00:30:14,812
and hope you
brought 'em up right.

467
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:21,653
George. Nina. Darling.

468
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:23,889
This guy was making
a little too much sense for me.

469
00:30:24,023 --> 00:30:27,961
Suddenly my shirt collar felt like
it was starting to strangle me.

470
00:30:28,061 --> 00:30:30,197
To George and Nina...

471
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,734
and a future
of wonderful memories.

472
00:30:32,867 --> 00:30:35,069
First, the wedding
of our children...

473
00:30:35,203 --> 00:30:38,374
and the happiness we'll share
watching their lives.

474
00:30:38,507 --> 00:30:42,045
Then sharing the joy
of our grandchildren together.

475
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:47,084
Birthday parties,
graduation--

476
00:30:53,626 --> 00:30:57,565
Now I knew where they got the
expression "like father, like son."

477
00:30:57,698 --> 00:31:01,101
- I also knew I needed some air.
- Can you tell me where the restroom is?

478
00:31:01,236 --> 00:31:04,940
Oh, actually, the one down here
is a mess. We're remodeling.

479
00:31:05,074 --> 00:31:09,079
Uh, why don't you try
the one at the top of the stairs?
It's the seventh door on the left.

480
00:31:09,213 --> 00:31:10,948
- Second?
- Seventh.

481
00:31:11,081 --> 00:31:14,352
- Seventh.
- Seventh.

482
00:32:36,687 --> 00:32:40,225
I'm leaving.
I'm relaxed, and I'm leaving.

483
00:33:02,786 --> 00:33:04,388
Relent.

484
00:33:04,522 --> 00:33:06,858
Re-- Recoil.

485
00:33:06,992 --> 00:33:08,561
Reverse.

486
00:33:11,664 --> 00:33:15,102
- Well, I hope George hasn't
gotten lost up there.
- Oh, no, he's gonna be fine.

487
00:33:15,235 --> 00:33:17,905
Okay.

488
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:21,876
Well, um--
Such a lovely sculpture.

489
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:24,813
Oh. Doesn't it have a wonderful
sense of motion?

490
00:33:24,914 --> 00:33:28,518
We got it in Denmark. All the-- Quite
a lot of my family's from Copenhagen.

491
00:33:28,652 --> 00:33:32,423
- Is that right?
- Oh, yeah. Doesn't it have
a wonderful sense of balance?

492
00:33:32,557 --> 00:33:34,660
- Oh, it's amazing.
- I was going to put it in the garden.

493
00:33:40,033 --> 00:33:42,869
Well, actually, uh, uh, Bryan spent
quite a few summers in Denmark.

494
00:33:43,002 --> 00:33:46,374
Uh, he now speaks
better Danish than, than Joanna.

495
00:33:48,076 --> 00:33:49,912
N-- Is that a fact?

496
00:34:01,626 --> 00:34:03,762
And we're planning a trip
back this summer.

497
00:34:03,896 --> 00:34:05,864
I think this is
a very beautiful spread here.

498
00:34:05,965 --> 00:34:09,135
- Oh, thank you.
- Well, shall--
should we wait for George?

499
00:34:36,102 --> 00:34:39,439
- Maybe I should, uh, check on George.
- No.

500
00:34:57,028 --> 00:35:01,566
- Release!
- Oh, man.

501
00:35:05,338 --> 00:35:09,376
Wow. No kidding?
Really? It went great?

502
00:35:09,543 --> 00:35:13,315
Uh, better than great. I mean, it, just,
just couldn't have gone better.

503
00:35:13,481 --> 00:35:15,483
God, I'm so relieved.

504
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:18,855
I mean, who knows what can happen
at these things, you know?

505
00:35:19,021 --> 00:35:21,759
- This is great.
- Now I feel like the wedding's
officially on.

506
00:35:21,893 --> 00:35:23,828
Um, Dad, that looks so good.
This looks great.

507
00:35:23,995 --> 00:35:27,866
Um, Bryan's mom called with the names
of her immediate family.

508
00:35:33,574 --> 00:35:36,410
- Is this a joke?
- Not only is it not a joke...

509
00:35:36,577 --> 00:35:38,779
but eight of them are
from Copenhagen and well...

510
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:41,617
it's the bride's family's
responsibility to--

511
00:35:41,783 --> 00:35:44,454
Do you have any idea what
a round-trip ticket from Denmark costs?

512
00:35:44,621 --> 00:35:46,689
Try eight round-trip tickets.

513
00:35:46,856 --> 00:35:48,758
Well, actually, it's nine.

514
00:35:48,891 --> 00:35:51,329
You see, Joanna's,
uh, cousin Gitte...

515
00:35:51,429 --> 00:35:56,434
is apparently a rather large woman
so she needs two seats.

516
00:35:56,568 --> 00:35:59,439
She can lop over into the aisle for all
I care 'cause there's no way I'm pay--

517
00:35:59,573 --> 00:36:00,907
Hi, everyone.
Sorry I'm late.

518
00:36:01,041 --> 00:36:02,877
- Hi.
- That's okay.
- How're you doing? Hi.

519
00:36:03,011 --> 00:36:04,879
- Hello.
- Hey, dude.
- Hi.

520
00:36:05,013 --> 00:36:07,882
- Oh. Here you are.
- Oh. Well, thank you.

521
00:36:09,451 --> 00:36:12,956
- It's "you're welcome" in Danish.
- Ah, thanks.

522
00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:17,128
This looks great. I hear you're
a whiz at the barbecue, Dad.

523
00:36:20,264 --> 00:36:24,971
Well. So have you two given any thought
to what kind of wedding you want?

524
00:36:25,104 --> 00:36:28,475
- Well, we've talked about it.
- Yes, and what do you think?

525
00:36:28,609 --> 00:36:30,244
Big? Small? Or--

526
00:36:30,377 --> 00:36:32,681
Well, it can't be too big.
We don't have that many friends.

527
00:36:32,814 --> 00:36:35,150
So we're talking
in the small vicinity, then?

528
00:36:35,283 --> 00:36:37,920
Well, no, she didn't say "small."
She said not too big.

529
00:36:38,054 --> 00:36:40,623
Yeah, but nothing fancy
or overblown, right?

530
00:36:40,756 --> 00:36:42,459
- Right.
- Right.

531
00:36:42,593 --> 00:36:45,495
So kind of the "less is more"
theory, huh, Annie?

532
00:36:45,629 --> 00:36:49,601
- Basically.
- The reason I'm asking all these
questions is I have a great idea...

533
00:36:49,702 --> 00:36:54,774
where we can have this lovely,
not small but not too big wedding.

534
00:36:54,874 --> 00:36:57,545
You do? Where?

535
00:36:57,678 --> 00:37:00,982
At our favorite restaurant, the place
we've been eating at for 15 years.

536
00:37:01,115 --> 00:37:05,722
The best.
The Steak Pit.

537
00:37:05,855 --> 00:37:09,560
- Dad, get serious.
- I don't think
you want the word "pit"...

538
00:37:09,693 --> 00:37:12,296
on a wedding invitation,
George.

539
00:37:12,429 --> 00:37:15,266
Really, Dad, a rib joint
with sawdust on the floor...

540
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:17,869
isn't exactly what I had in mind
for my wedding.

541
00:37:18,003 --> 00:37:19,639
- No offence.
- Well, excuse me.

542
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:21,807
What did you have in mind,
the Beverly Hills Hotel?

543
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:25,112
No. Actually, what I'd like
is to have...

544
00:37:25,212 --> 00:37:27,548
my wedding in a church
and have the reception here.

545
00:37:27,682 --> 00:37:29,350
- Oh.
- That's what I was hoping for.

546
00:37:29,484 --> 00:37:31,453
Here?

547
00:37:38,929 --> 00:37:42,199
Don't I have
the greatest Dad in the world?

548
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:44,670
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.

549
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:48,373
- Can we have some burgers?
- Okay, here's the bride burger
and your groom burger.

550
00:37:48,508 --> 00:37:51,511
And, uh, enjoy 'em. Now, go on
over there and see the jugglers.

551
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:54,248
My dream wedding,
a barbecue wedding.

552
00:38:02,191 --> 00:38:04,361
- This is a better idea
than the Steak Pit.
- Yeah.

553
00:38:04,494 --> 00:38:08,066
We'll get some, uh, picnic tables
and, uh, crepe paper and balloons.

554
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:12,771
You know, invite all our best pals.
I'll make my famous guacamole.

555
00:38:12,905 --> 00:38:16,409
A wedding at home.
This is a great idea.

556
00:38:19,546 --> 00:38:23,584
Great idea. Picnic tables, crepe paper,
balloons, you at the barbecue.

557
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:26,121
- Oh, George.
- What don't you like about that?

558
00:38:26,254 --> 00:38:29,626
Why have you been
acting so crazy since the moment
Annie told you she was getting married?

559
00:38:29,759 --> 00:38:32,528
You know, I haven't been acting crazy.
I've simply acted...

560
00:38:32,629 --> 00:38:35,299
Like any normal,
red-blooded American dad.

561
00:38:35,432 --> 00:38:39,471
Normal? Uh-huh. Okay.
Falling in the MacKenzie's pool.

562
00:38:39,604 --> 00:38:41,941
Suggesting the Steak Pit
as a wedding reception.

563
00:38:42,074 --> 00:38:45,612
Oh, watching America's Most Wanted
every night, looking for Bryan's face.

564
00:38:45,746 --> 00:38:49,651
And now this picnic scenario.
George, a wedding is a big deal!

565
00:38:49,784 --> 00:38:52,754
Everybody seems to understand this
but you. And as a matter of fact--

566
00:38:52,854 --> 00:38:56,960
N-Now don't go nuts when I tell
you this, but when Bryan's mom...

567
00:38:57,093 --> 00:39:00,030
called with her list, she
suggested that they might just wanna...

568
00:39:00,163 --> 00:39:02,265
pitch in and help
with the cost of the wedding.

569
00:39:02,399 --> 00:39:06,037
You know, hey, we may not have a house
the size of Rhode Island,
but we're not poverty-stricken.

570
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:09,174
We can certainly afford to give
our daughter a proper wedding.

571
00:39:09,308 --> 00:39:12,577
Proper. Not you in a chef's hat,
right, George?

572
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:15,416
- Who said anything about a chef's hat?
When did this come up?
- Yes, but I know you.

573
00:39:15,516 --> 00:39:18,118
I'm close. Oh, look.

574
00:39:18,218 --> 00:39:20,588
I just really saw this
whole thing differently.

575
00:39:20,689 --> 00:39:23,359
Like, I wanted to call a wedding
coordinator to make the whole thing...

576
00:39:23,492 --> 00:39:26,496
really, really beautiful, and you want
to call Gabe at the Steak Pit.

577
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,967
Wait a minute. Wedding coordinator?
What's a wedding coordinator?

578
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:33,705
- A person who coordinates weddings.
- What's to coordinate?

579
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:37,977
Well, there's the invitations
and the flowers, the food,
the band, the photographer.

580
00:39:38,078 --> 00:39:42,049
George, why are you
giving me that look again? A lot
of people hire wedding coordinators.

581
00:39:42,182 --> 00:39:46,887
Nina, you and I run
successful businesses. We can certainly
pull together one smallish wedding.

582
00:39:47,021 --> 00:39:49,024
- Yeah, okay.
- We don't need
some fancy wedding coordinator.

583
00:39:49,157 --> 00:39:52,729
Okay, George, then
let's just forget it, okay? Because,
you know, I just really can't take this.

584
00:39:52,862 --> 00:39:55,365
- I'm not used to all this
arguing, so just, uh--
- Fine. I don't want to argue.

585
00:39:55,498 --> 00:39:59,003
Just-- Do me a favor, okay, George?
Just go on upstairs and I'll...

586
00:39:59,103 --> 00:40:01,740
- finish up down here.
- Fine. Fine. I'll go upstairs.

587
00:40:01,873 --> 00:40:04,876
However, I would like
to remind you what happened
to what's-his-name down the street.

588
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:07,681
His daughter got married and the thing
practically broke him. Remember?

589
00:40:07,814 --> 00:40:09,950
- I remember.
- You and I could end up...

590
00:40:10,083 --> 00:40:13,086
shuffling along the sidewalk
in our bathrobes.

591
00:40:15,423 --> 00:40:18,894
- That was a joke.
- Hilarious.

592
00:40:19,028 --> 00:40:23,199
Oh, all right. I'll go.
I'll meet the wedding coordinator.

593
00:40:23,299 --> 00:40:26,037
You know I don't want to,
but I'll go...

594
00:40:26,137 --> 00:40:28,839
if you still want me to go,
all right?

595
00:40:28,939 --> 00:40:32,377
- Okay?
- Okay.

596
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:36,282
Now, let me do the talking,
girls, okay?

597
00:40:36,416 --> 00:40:38,384
Well, I negotiate better than you.

598
00:40:38,484 --> 00:40:40,254
- Now what's this guy's name?
- Franck.

599
00:40:40,387 --> 00:40:42,156
- Frank.
- Franck.

600
00:40:42,289 --> 00:40:43,692
- Franck?
- Franck.

601
00:40:43,792 --> 00:40:47,863
- Franck. Franck. Franck.
- Oh, this is it.

602
00:40:47,963 --> 00:40:50,299
Okay, here we go.

603
00:40:50,433 --> 00:40:53,804
- Ah, Mom.
- No. No. This is just--

604
00:40:53,937 --> 00:40:56,107
- Oh, my, Annie.
- This is amazing.

605
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:58,076
- Look. Look at this trim.
- What?

606
00:40:58,176 --> 00:40:59,944
- Oh!
- Isn't this beautiful? Pearls.

607
00:41:00,078 --> 00:41:02,615
- Oh!
- Oh, gee.

608
00:41:02,782 --> 00:41:05,251
-Oh, wow. I love how they did this, Mom.
-Annie.

609
00:41:05,418 --> 00:41:06,887
- Yeah?
- Do you like this place setting?

610
00:41:06,987 --> 00:41:09,123
- Oh, it's beautiful.
- That china also comes...

611
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:11,592
in a wonderful Sara Lee yellow.

612
00:41:11,726 --> 00:41:15,197
- Hi. You must be Franck?
- I wish.

613
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:18,468
I'm Franck's assistant,
Howard Weinstein.

614
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,904
-Well, I'm Nina Banks and this is Annie.

615
00:41:21,071 --> 00:41:23,173

616
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,910
- George, my husband.
- How do you do?

617
00:41:26,077 --> 00:41:30,216
May I offer anyone any refreshments:
Pellegrino, espresso, champagne?

618
00:41:30,349 --> 00:41:33,854
- Oh. Um, no. No.
- No.

619
00:41:34,021 --> 00:41:39,461
I'll alert the boss that you're here.
Look around. Have fun.

620
00:41:39,561 --> 00:41:41,697
Oh. Oh.
This is so great.

621
00:41:43,933 --> 00:41:45,300
- Annie.
- Yeah?

622
00:41:45,468 --> 00:41:49,306
- Oh! Wouldn't this be perfect for you?
- Oh, it's gorgeous!

623
00:41:49,407 --> 00:41:52,677
Look how it goes with the crystal.
Oh, perfect.

624
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:57,049
Moster and Missus Banks

00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:08,029
- Oh, yes.
- Yes.
- Oh, the bride, the bride.

629
00:42:08,196 --> 00:42:12,234
Right away, I realized this was
a mistake of gargantuan proportions.

630
00:42:12,401 --> 00:42:16,540
This guy was going to coordinate
our wedding? How? With subtitles?

631
00:42:16,674 --> 00:42:18,710

00:42:31,292 --> 00:42:33,461

Very nice, I think.

636
00:42:33,627 --> 00:42:36,732

Five munths not much!

00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:08,071
But that don't bother me so much
because it's a little bit tight...

Oh! Oh!
That is incredible!

661
00:43:56,798 --> 00:43:59,101
Annie, that's just like the one
we saw in the magazine.

662
00:43:59,201 --> 00:44:01,037
Do you like it, Dad?

663
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:05,908
Well, what is that? Is that--
Is that dollars? $1,200?

664
00:44:06,042 --> 00:44:09,146

for a keck of dis magnootud.

666
00:44:11,182 --> 00:44:13,918
A cake, Franck, is made
of flour and water.

667
00:44:14,052 --> 00:44:16,989
- My first car didn't cost $1,200
- George.

668
00:44:17,123 --> 00:44:22,864
Well, welcome to the '90s,
Moster Bonks.

669
00:44:22,997 --> 00:44:26,201
Not only did I not understand
a syllable this guy was saying...

670
00:44:26,335 --> 00:44:28,370
now I had the feeling
he was putting me down.

671
00:44:28,504 --> 00:44:31,740
Excuse me, um, Franck.

672
00:44:31,875 --> 00:44:33,878
- Could we please have a second?
- Oh, of course!

673
00:44:34,011 --> 00:44:38,383
Take two seconds. Howard,
letz return calls. Could we--

674
00:44:40,852 --> 00:44:44,190
All right, George, what's the problem?
Do you want to leave?

675
00:44:44,323 --> 00:44:46,526
- Do you?
- No. I like him.

676
00:44:46,626 --> 00:44:50,597
I think he's going to make this
a beautiful wedding.

677
00:44:50,731 --> 00:44:52,600
Don't look at me.
You guys decide.

678
00:44:52,734 --> 00:44:57,072
Give the man a chance, George, please.
Annie, do you like this cake?

679
00:44:57,205 --> 00:45:00,644
It is incredible, Dad.

680
00:45:00,776 --> 00:45:02,646
- Well, all right.
But, look, let's just--
- I know.

681
00:45:02,779 --> 00:45:04,915
We-- We're going to, George.
We're gonna hold things down.

682
00:45:05,048 --> 00:45:08,087
- We just-- We won't go nuts.
- No. No.
- Thank you.

683
00:45:08,219 --> 00:45:10,189
- Franck!
- Coming!

684
00:45:13,893 --> 00:45:17,264
- We'll take the cake.
- Oh, good, good.

685
00:45:17,398 --> 00:45:19,934
Don't worry, Moster Bonks. I'm gonna
bring de crew over to the house.

686
00:45:20,067 --> 00:45:23,105
We gif everything that we haf
in the once-over department...

687
00:45:23,238 --> 00:45:25,541
and then in the end you be
vary, vary happy, trust me.

688
00:45:25,641 --> 00:45:29,780
- You just smile away.
Now, interesting idea.
- Yes.

689
00:45:29,913 --> 00:45:33,651
Wit regard to thame and kolor
of de wedding, dis is how I see it:

690
00:45:33,785 --> 00:45:36,422
I think we go vary elegant,
inside de tent, you know--

691
00:45:36,555 --> 00:45:39,558
With one swift move,
I'd been cut out of the deal.

692
00:45:39,658 --> 00:45:41,660
Annie, Nina and Franck
were in charge now.

693
00:45:41,794 --> 00:45:43,263
...and bootiful china--

694
00:45:43,397 --> 00:45:46,834
Now, spo! And crystal
to drop over dead for!

695
00:45:46,968 --> 00:45:49,971
Old Dad was history.

696
00:45:50,172 --> 00:45:53,041
- ...new machine to work now.
- A few days later, I was at work...

697
00:45:53,175 --> 00:45:55,278
relieved for once not to be
talking about the wedding.

698
00:45:55,412 --> 00:45:58,482
- I wore those 750-trainers
over the weekend.
- They still stiff?

699
00:45:58,616 --> 00:46:02,454
- I think they need a soft--
- Just back from the Orient, ladies,
and I got a new shipment.

700
00:46:02,587 --> 00:46:06,526
Beautiful merchandise.
Gucci, Cartier, Louis Vuitton.

701
00:46:06,659 --> 00:46:08,428
- I never heard of Louis Vuitton.
- I don't know.

702
00:46:08,528 --> 00:46:11,765
He's big, darling, believe me, or they
wouldn't be knocking 'em off.

703
00:46:11,865 --> 00:46:13,467
Don't worry, Mr Banks,
they're on a break.

704
00:46:13,601 --> 00:46:15,603
- That's okay.
- George, Franck's office, line two.

705
00:46:15,703 --> 00:46:19,240
Uh, maybe I could see those mockups
by Friday, then, Dave? Thanks.

706
00:46:19,374 --> 00:46:21,511
This was the call I'd been dreading
since the moment I heard...

707
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:24,147
the words, "wedding coordinator."

708
00:46:24,247 --> 00:46:27,485
- Hello.
- Mr Banks, this is Howard Weinstein...

709
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,521
Franck's executive assistant.

710
00:46:29,654 --> 00:46:32,491
I have-- estimate for you.

711
00:46:32,624 --> 00:46:35,528
- I can barely hear you!
- I'm in my car...

712
00:46:35,662 --> 00:46:38,098
going through ...water Canyon.

713
00:46:38,231 --> 00:46:40,267
- Call you back?
- No, no, no! I-I want the estimate.

714
00:46:40,401 --> 00:46:42,369
How much?
What's the damage?

715
00:46:42,503 --> 00:46:46,909
For everything from the flowers
to the honeymoon limo--

716
00:46:47,043 --> 00:46:49,045
Okay, everything.
How much?

717
00:46:49,178 --> 00:46:52,215
--dred --ifty head.

718
00:46:52,348 --> 00:46:55,886
You're breaking up. It sounded like
you said 150 a head.

719
00:46:56,019 --> 00:46:57,956
No! No!

720
00:46:58,089 --> 00:47:03,195
- Good. I was about to kill myself.
- It's 250 a head.

721
00:47:09,137 --> 00:47:11,773
- Get me Nina at work.
- She just called.

722
00:47:11,906 --> 00:47:15,711
- I need the final head count.
- She just gave it to me.

723
00:47:15,844 --> 00:47:19,048
What is it? One-fifty?

724
00:47:19,149 --> 00:47:21,118
572.

725
00:47:25,222 --> 00:47:29,127
$250 a head means for the four of us to
attend this wedding in our own home...

726
00:47:29,261 --> 00:47:31,297
will cost $1,000.

727
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:33,099
Therefore, we are not
getting up from this table...

728
00:47:33,232 --> 00:47:35,636
until we cut this list down
to the bare minimum.

729
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:38,606
Now, invite as many people as you want
to the church, pack 'em in...

730
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:41,276
build a grandstand if you want,
but we are not having...

731
00:47:41,409 --> 00:47:44,980
more than 150 people in this house
on the day of the wedding.

732
00:47:45,114 --> 00:47:50,254
-All right. Now let's start eliminating.
-Okay, Jim Pepper and wife.

733
00:47:50,354 --> 00:47:54,827
- Oh, great. Start with one of my guys.
- Fine. We'll start with one of mine.
I'll cut Steve and Stephanie Turrill.

734
00:47:54,959 --> 00:47:57,129
- They're very good
clients of mine. They're--
- Say no more. They're history.

735
00:47:57,262 --> 00:48:00,100
- All right. Jim Pepper and wife.
- I've known the guy for 20 years.

736
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,103
You haven't seen him
in 15, George.

737
00:48:02,203 --> 00:48:04,105
All right. I'll say
I lost his address.

738
00:48:04,205 --> 00:48:08,376
Now here's somebody-- your cousin Betsy,
the poet/waitress/picture framer.

739
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:12,281
We can't cut family.
They know about the wedding.

740
00:48:12,381 --> 00:48:16,988
I only invited one person: Cameron.
Mom said I could have a friend there.

741
00:48:17,121 --> 00:48:19,657
For 250 bucks, you can see Cameron
after the wedding.

742
00:48:19,791 --> 00:48:23,295
All right. Very good.
Five down. We're rolling.

743
00:48:23,395 --> 00:48:26,165
All right. What about Harry Kirby?
We haven't seen him in ages.

744
00:48:26,298 --> 00:48:30,036
- I don't know.
- Didn't Harry Kirby die last year?

745
00:48:30,203 --> 00:48:32,038
Yes! Good!

746
00:48:34,008 --> 00:48:36,845
Oh, uh, sorry.

747
00:48:36,979 --> 00:48:39,581
- Who's Franck Eggelhoffer?
- What?

748
00:48:39,715 --> 00:48:42,686
He's coordinating the wedding,
and then we're not going to invite him?

749
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:45,723
Exactly! Do you think
I'm gonna pay a guy 15%%%...

750
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:50,396
plus an hourly, plus an additional $500
to feed him and that assistant of his?

751
00:48:50,562 --> 00:48:55,134
- Have you lost your mind?
- Can I put Cameron back on the list
if he promises not to eat?

752
00:48:55,268 --> 00:48:58,872
You know, that's not a bad idea.
Who else can we ask not to eat?

753
00:48:59,006 --> 00:49:00,975
My parents, your mother.

754
00:49:01,075 --> 00:49:05,814
Why don't we just charge people? That
way we can make money on the wedding.

755
00:49:05,915 --> 00:49:07,884
Annie. A--

756
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:15,159
I was kidding.

757
00:50:00,983 --> 00:50:04,120
"How to give a beautiful wedding
on a small budget.

758
00:50:06,924 --> 00:50:09,527
"Bake your own wedding cake.

759
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:14,467
"Find a good tailor and copy
a designer dress.

760
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,270
Have a friend take the pictures."

761
00:50:26,448 --> 00:50:32,155
From that moment on, I decided
to shut my mouth and go with the flow.

762
00:50:34,491 --> 00:50:37,962
My first move was to get
the old tuxedo out of mothballs.

763
00:51:20,548 --> 00:51:24,553
Hey! Looking good, my man.

764
00:51:24,686 --> 00:51:26,788
Get down! Hey!

765
00:51:26,923 --> 00:51:31,929
What's new, pussycat
Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh

766
00:51:32,062 --> 00:51:36,101
What's new, pussycat
Whoa, whoa, whoa

767
00:51:36,234 --> 00:51:38,603
- Whoa, whoa
- George!

768
00:51:38,738 --> 00:51:40,940
- Hey
- Annie, he's up here.

769
00:51:41,073 --> 00:51:45,979
Pussycat, pussycat
I love you

770
00:51:46,113 --> 00:51:48,382
'Deed I do

771
00:51:48,516 --> 00:51:50,753
Yes, I do

772
00:51:50,886 --> 00:51:54,357
Hey, what do you think?
Bought it in '75 and it still fits.

773
00:51:56,125 --> 00:52:00,431
- Like a glove.
- Yes. It's just, it's a real way to go.

774
00:52:00,565 --> 00:52:02,601
Um, maybe--

775
00:52:04,303 --> 00:52:07,806
Maybe you could get a new tux.
Uh, we're all wearing new clothes, and--

776
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:11,010
What? Don't you think I look cute?
I mean, there will be a lot
of single gals there.

777
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,816
- I'll get it.
- Oh, oh.

778
00:52:15,951 --> 00:52:19,254
Oh, by the way. Good news.
The church is free.

779
00:52:19,387 --> 00:52:24,294
- Oh, finally something is free.
- I meant available.

780
00:52:24,428 --> 00:52:26,296
Oh, I like that. It's very good.

781
00:52:26,497 --> 00:52:28,266
Adorable.

782
00:52:28,399 --> 00:52:33,238
Oh, they've done the shutters. It's like
kind of an I Remember Mama touch.

783
00:52:33,338 --> 00:52:36,775
Oh, it's very nice.
We change it all though. Let's go.

784
00:52:36,876 --> 00:52:42,183
Franck and his crew had arrived to
finalize all the details of the wedding.

785
00:52:42,316 --> 00:52:45,454
First was an audition for a band singer.

786
00:52:45,587 --> 00:52:49,959
Volare
Oh, oh

787
00:52:50,059 --> 00:52:53,330
Cantare
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

788
00:52:54,665 --> 00:52:57,002
No wonder
Annie's happy heart sings

789
00:52:57,135 --> 00:52:59,971
Bryan's love has given her wings
Hey!

790
00:53:00,071 --> 00:53:01,974
Like birds of a feather
A rainbow together--

791
00:53:02,074 --> 00:53:05,512
Just as I was about to say, "Don't
call us, we'll call you," I heard...

792
00:53:05,646 --> 00:53:09,450
Howard, we'll huf to move out all de
furniture to huf any sort of room to--

793
00:53:09,551 --> 00:53:12,821
Oh. Dis is a nice statement.

794
00:53:12,922 --> 00:53:16,192
It's lots of fun.
Mrs Bonks, one kvestion--

795
00:53:16,325 --> 00:53:19,362
Howard, uh, Franck was saying something
about moving out the furniture.

796
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:22,733
We have to move it all out
if we're going to fit
more than 200 bodies in here.

797
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:26,505
- But what if someone wants to sit down?
- We bring in chairs.

798
00:53:26,638 --> 00:53:30,376
Well, if you're bringing in chairs, then
why are you moving the furniture out?

799
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:34,013
Mr Bonks, I do dis for a loving,
you know? Trust me.

800
00:53:34,113 --> 00:53:36,217
A movink van must tek everything out.

801
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:38,653
It's an extra expense. Oh, sure.
Yah, yah.

802
00:53:38,753 --> 00:53:40,722
Bot we need it. Annie!

803
00:53:40,856 --> 00:53:43,792
Mrs Bonks. Come this way, please.
So, vhat do you think of the zinger?

804
00:53:43,925 --> 00:53:46,063
- We do have other choizes.
- I'd like to see 'em.

805
00:53:46,196 --> 00:53:49,366
Good. That'll be no problem.

806
00:53:49,499 --> 00:53:53,438
My caterer, everyone, and my best friend
in the whole world, Hanck Kucinetzki.

807
00:53:54,772 --> 00:53:55,908
Hi.

808
00:53:56,041 --> 00:53:58,043
- Hi.
- Hi.

809
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:01,715
If I cud have a mewmunt of yer time
to discuss de monyo.

810
00:54:01,815 --> 00:54:04,685
- "De monyo." "De monyo." Remind me?
The menu! Yes.
- No, the menu.

811
00:54:04,785 --> 00:54:08,690
Onfortulley, Hanck doesn't
spake Anglish, so I will translit.

812
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:11,360
Franck, that'll--
that'll be a big help.

813
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:30,017
Dis is vhat Hanck sugjoost.
Fer the men kers, he vants to serf voll.

814
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:33,321
Oh, really?
I have a problem with that.

815
00:54:33,454 --> 00:54:36,024
- With what?
- With veal. I keep reading...

816
00:54:36,157 --> 00:54:38,928
there's a lot of inhumane treatment
in the way they treat the calves.

817
00:54:39,028 --> 00:54:41,965
I read that too.
You're very chic. No voll.

818
00:54:45,002 --> 00:54:46,971
So that leafs seafoot,
which is also chic.

819
00:54:47,104 --> 00:54:48,974
Or fowl, which is not chic
but chip.

820
00:54:49,107 --> 00:54:54,914
Cheap. Finally a word I understood.
My first and last piece of good news.

821
00:54:55,014 --> 00:54:56,750
- Mrs Banks?
- Yes?

822
00:54:56,850 --> 00:55:00,522
One last thing.

823
00:55:00,655 --> 00:55:03,925
- What is he doing?
- We need more amps
to light the house and the tent.

824
00:55:04,025 --> 00:55:07,864
- It's cheaper
than bringing in a new line.
- In terms of the florals out front...

825
00:55:07,997 --> 00:55:10,767
we're gonna color coordinate
with the swans, right?

826
00:55:10,868 --> 00:55:12,703
- Swans?
- I think it'd be wonderful.
- Perfect.

827
00:55:12,836 --> 00:55:14,939
- We're having swans?
- Franck thought it would be great...

828
00:55:15,039 --> 00:55:17,809
to have swans waddling around
the tulip border, you know,
as the guests enter.

829
00:55:17,942 --> 00:55:21,347
- It would be really sweet.
- Nina, we don't have a tulip border.
- You will.

830
00:55:23,482 --> 00:55:24,951
How much is--

831
00:55:25,051 --> 00:55:27,420
Mr Bonks,
ve huff problus.

832
00:55:27,621 --> 00:55:29,725
Hanck does not vant
no vay to prepare chuckun.

833
00:55:29,858 --> 00:55:34,197
- He doesn't what?
- Franck, does the tent connect
through here?

834
00:55:34,329 --> 00:55:37,333
I've been meaning to fix that.
You have to push, then pull.

835
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:42,540
Oh.

836
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:45,510
Oh, now les not panic
about anything. Les see.

837
00:55:45,644 --> 00:55:48,814
Oh. Oh, that-- Eww. That's only
a sem. We cun fix that.

838
00:55:48,981 --> 00:55:51,251
Now, Mr Bonks, please,
about the seafoot.

839
00:55:51,385 --> 00:55:53,754
Hanck vants to know
if it's hokay or not hokay.

840
00:55:53,921 --> 00:55:59,595
No, Franck.
Tell Hanck it's not okay.

841
00:55:59,762 --> 00:56:03,366
If I have to move out
all the furniture and add amps...

842
00:56:03,466 --> 00:56:08,605
and repaint the walls and get
a new tux and pay for swans...

843
00:56:08,738 --> 00:56:12,243
then I'd like
the "chipper" chicken.

844
00:56:12,376 --> 00:56:17,317
- Is that clear?
- I understood the "chipper" part. Yeah.

845
00:56:29,699 --> 00:56:33,036
Hokay. Dat's it. Hanck says
he will think about dis.

846
00:56:33,136 --> 00:56:35,172
Now, we do not vant
to louse him.

847
00:56:35,339 --> 00:56:40,178
He is a ganius, and
ve need his mand. Hokay? So.

848
00:56:40,346 --> 00:56:44,317
I'll see vhat I can do.
Hanck? Hanck!

849
00:56:46,186 --> 00:56:48,356
I'm fine.

850
00:56:49,522 --> 00:56:52,193
Anyway, where were we? Oh.

851
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:54,263
- Yes.
- I see you're starting to lose it.

852
00:56:54,429 --> 00:56:56,632
But I have one more question.
Very minor. I'll say it quickly.

853
00:56:56,798 --> 00:56:59,903
Parking attendants. Four is comfortable.
Three is acceptable. Anything less...

854
00:57:00,069 --> 00:57:02,640
- absolutely terrifies me.
- Two.

855
00:57:02,806 --> 00:57:05,476
- Two.
- George--
- Two.

856
00:57:05,609 --> 00:57:08,346
Hanck says if you vant the fowl,
he vasn't interested. He passes.

857
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,118
He-- He passes?
Is he gonna do our cake?

858
00:57:12,251 --> 00:57:13,854
Hey, Dad. How's it going?

859
00:57:13,987 --> 00:57:16,623
Hi. I came to get my sneakers.
I left them in Annie's room last night.

860
00:57:16,723 --> 00:57:21,162
I was beginning to feel like I was
having an out-of-body experience.

861
00:57:21,296 --> 00:57:23,465
I had to get out
of the house and fast.

862
00:57:28,405 --> 00:57:30,507
Nina said as long as
I was escaping, would I mind...

863
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,311
escaping to the market
and picking up something for dinner?

864
00:57:33,411 --> 00:57:36,714
Sure. That was all I needed.
A busy supermarket.

865
00:57:36,847 --> 00:57:40,319
I needed to drive, mellow out,
get my mind off the wedding.

866
00:57:42,422 --> 00:57:45,125
But mellowing out
was not in the cards.

867
00:57:45,225 --> 00:57:47,962
Here we go.
Here we go. Yeah.

868
00:57:51,499 --> 00:57:55,771
- Excuse me, sir. What are you doing?
- I'll tell you what I'm doing.

869
00:57:55,905 --> 00:58:00,210
I want to buy eight hot dogs
and eight hot dog buns to go with them.

870
00:58:00,344 --> 00:58:04,583
But no one sells eight hot dog buns.
They only sell twelve hot dog buns.

871
00:58:04,717 --> 00:58:07,186
So I end up paying
for four buns I don't need.

872
00:58:07,319 --> 00:58:10,256
So I am removing
the superfluous buns.

873
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:13,627
I-I'm sorry, sir, but you're gonna
have to pay for all twelve buns.

874
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:17,099
- They're not marked individually.
- Yeah.

875
00:58:17,232 --> 00:58:21,637
And you wanna know why? Because some
big shot over at the wiener company...

876
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:25,241
got together with some big shot
over at the bun company...

877
00:58:25,375 --> 00:58:27,411
and decided to rip off
the American public.

878
00:58:27,544 --> 00:58:31,283
Because they think the American public
is a bunch of trusting nitwits...

879
00:58:31,416 --> 00:58:34,720
- who'll pay for things they don't need
rather than make a stink.
- Get me security.

880
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:37,456
Well, they're not ripping off
this nitwit anymore...

881
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:40,193
because I'm not paying
for one more thing I don't need.

882
00:58:40,294 --> 00:58:43,363
George Banks is saying no!

883
00:58:43,463 --> 00:58:45,099
Who's George Banks?

884
00:58:47,736 --> 00:58:50,040
Me!

885
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:52,943
Uh, why don't we just
calm down now, sir?

886
00:58:53,076 --> 00:58:56,314
I'll tell you why "we" don't calm down.
Because you're not excited.

887
00:58:56,447 --> 00:59:00,052
It takes two people for a "we"
to calm down, doesn't it?

888
00:59:00,152 --> 00:59:04,591
Uh, that I don't know, sir. I'm just
the assistant manager of a supermarket.

889
00:59:04,691 --> 00:59:09,697
But I'll tell you this. If you don't
pipe down and pay for those buns...

890
00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:14,336
- I'm gonna call the police.
- Oh, right!

891
00:59:14,469 --> 00:59:16,472
Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Right.

892
00:59:16,605 --> 00:59:18,074
- That's right.
- Hey.

893
00:59:18,174 --> 00:59:20,077
- Right.
- Hey! Hey, come here!

894
00:59:20,177 --> 00:59:21,612
- Uh-uh! Uh-uh!
- Come here!

895
00:59:21,712 --> 00:59:23,681
Uh-uh! Uh-uh!

896
00:59:31,523 --> 00:59:36,263
That was the low point.
Flipping out over four hot dog buns.

897
00:59:36,363 --> 00:59:38,634
I couldn't figure out
why I'd gotten so nuts...

898
00:59:38,734 --> 00:59:40,869
why the wedding had me so unglued.

899
00:59:41,003 --> 00:59:44,274
Banks, your wife is here.

900
00:59:47,610 --> 00:59:53,084
- Aren't you going to let me out?
- She wants to talk to you first.

901
00:59:53,218 --> 00:59:56,289
- She wants to talk to me first?
- Thank you.

902
01:00:00,327 --> 01:00:03,830
Hello, George.

903
01:00:03,932 --> 01:00:06,234
Why do you look happy
to see me in here, Nina?

904
01:00:06,367 --> 01:00:10,372
Happy? No, no, no.
I'm not happy, George.

905
01:00:10,506 --> 01:00:12,474
You think I was happy to tell everyone
that I had to come...

906
01:00:12,574 --> 01:00:15,211
down to the city jail and bail you out
for stealing hot dog buns?

907
01:00:15,345 --> 01:00:18,015
- I wasn't stealing them--
- Ah!

908
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:21,052
- I was having a little--
- Ah!

909
01:00:21,185 --> 01:00:23,121
I'm going to have to ask you
not to talk or I'll have to call...

910
01:00:23,254 --> 01:00:25,892
Officer What's-his-name
over there.

911
01:00:27,894 --> 01:00:30,697
You've been more
than I can handle, George.

912
01:00:30,797 --> 01:00:33,368
Annie's wedding is not
a conspiracy against you.

913
01:00:33,501 --> 01:00:37,373
It's just a wedding. People have them
every day in every country in the world.

914
01:00:37,506 --> 01:00:41,411
I know it's going to be expensive,
but we don't go to Europe.

915
01:00:41,545 --> 01:00:44,114
We don't own fancy cars.
I don't own expensive jewelry.

916
01:00:44,247 --> 01:00:47,118
So we can afford
to have a big wedding.

917
01:00:47,251 --> 01:00:48,954
Nina.

918
01:00:49,088 --> 01:00:51,357
I'll get you out of here
on one condition, Banks.

919
01:00:51,457 --> 01:00:55,695
That you agree to the following.
Now, repeat after me.

920
01:00:55,795 --> 01:00:59,000
I, George Stanley Banks...

921
01:01:01,969 --> 01:01:03,772
I, George Stanley Banks...

922
01:01:03,905 --> 01:01:08,443
promise to pull it together
and act my age. Promise.

923
01:01:08,578 --> 01:01:10,614
promise to pull it together
and act my age.

924
01:01:10,748 --> 01:01:15,953
I will stop hyper ventilating, rolling my
eyes, unbuttoning my top collar button.

925
01:01:16,086 --> 01:01:20,760
- I don't unbutton my top collar--
- Oh yeah. No. You mean this bit, with--

926
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:23,195
- Stop hyper ventilating...
- Hyper ventilating.

927
01:01:23,329 --> 01:01:25,165
- rolling my eyes, and, uh...
- Unbuttoning.

928
01:01:25,299 --> 01:01:27,334
unbuttoning
my top collar button.

929
01:01:27,467 --> 01:01:30,104
I will stop making faces in general,
and I will definitely stop...

930
01:01:30,204 --> 01:01:32,841
telling everybody I meet
how much this wedding is costing.

931
01:01:32,975 --> 01:01:37,147
I don't tell everyone
how much it costs!

932
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,451
- He told you, right?
- 250 a head.

933
01:01:40,584 --> 01:01:43,889
Oh, well, thanks!

934
01:01:48,127 --> 01:01:51,497
I will try to remember
my daughter's feelings.

935
01:01:51,632 --> 01:01:57,672
And how with every roll of my eyes, I am
taking away a piece of her happiness.

936
01:01:57,806 --> 01:02:01,142
I love you, Nina.

937
01:02:01,242 --> 01:02:03,779
Just repeat the last part
for me, George.

938
01:02:03,879 --> 01:02:05,682
I will try to remember
my daughter's feelings...

939
01:02:05,816 --> 01:02:09,152
- That's right.
- and how with every roll of my eyes...

940
01:02:09,253 --> 01:02:12,924
I am taking away
a piece of her happiness.

941
01:02:13,057 --> 01:02:17,263
I love you too.
Let's go home, okay?

942
01:02:20,467 --> 01:02:22,836
- No!
- Hey, I'm gonna hold ya here!

943
01:02:23,004 --> 01:02:25,207
- Yes! Sweet!
- Come on, Matty. Let's go.

944
01:02:25,374 --> 01:02:27,843
Plan "B," Matty. Plan "B."

945
01:02:27,943 --> 01:02:30,512
Here we go! Hey!

946
01:02:30,679 --> 01:02:32,816
Okay, I got ya! I got ya!

947
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:35,052
- Midget slam!
- All right!

948
01:02:35,219 --> 01:02:38,055
Annie! Bryan! Look,
you got a present.

949
01:02:38,188 --> 01:02:40,025
Our first present!
I can't believe it.

950
01:02:40,125 --> 01:02:41,926
Oh, our second one
should be here any minute.

951
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:44,697
- Oh, wow. How do you know?
- Oh, my parents are bringing it over.

952
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:45,998
- Oh!
- Oh!

953
01:02:46,098 --> 01:02:48,769
Oh, this is, uh, when we give
the presents. Uh, great. Uh, good.

954
01:02:48,902 --> 01:02:50,938
- I'll be right back.
- Where's he going?

955
01:02:51,105 --> 01:02:53,408
- Maybe he got a present for you.
- You know about this?

956
01:02:53,574 --> 01:02:55,543
Uh, I haven't got a clue.

957
01:03:07,792 --> 01:03:11,296
- Look at this!
- This is for us? Thank you so much!

958
01:03:14,167 --> 01:03:16,470
Yikes. A whole car.

959
01:03:16,637 --> 01:03:19,139
My dad's gotta see this!

960
01:03:24,647 --> 01:03:27,751
Dad! Dad?

961
01:03:29,418 --> 01:03:31,956
Dad, did you see
what the MacKenzies got us?

962
01:03:32,123 --> 01:03:34,625
It's unbelievable. And you thought
you'd never have a new car.

963
01:03:34,792 --> 01:03:37,730
I know! What's that?

964
01:03:37,896 --> 01:03:42,535
It's nothing. It's just a gift
I was thinking of giving you guys.

965
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:46,374
You know, it's something you said
you didn't have but you wanted.

966
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:48,976
Can I see it?

967
01:03:49,144 --> 01:03:51,613
Yeah, you know, it's--

968
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:56,619
It's not the big,
big gift, of course.

969
01:04:03,128 --> 01:04:05,131
It's a cappuccino maker!

970
01:04:05,297 --> 01:04:07,700
Supposed to be a good one.
That's what they said at the store.

971
01:04:07,867 --> 01:04:11,872
It's, uh, top of the line.
Makes great foam.

972
01:04:18,246 --> 01:04:20,649
I couldn't love anything more.

973
01:04:23,253 --> 01:04:26,390
Going to the chapel and we're

974
01:04:26,524 --> 01:04:30,696
- My feelings exactly.
- Gonna get married

975
01:04:30,829 --> 01:04:34,600
Going to the chapel and we're

976
01:04:34,734 --> 01:04:38,739
- Gonna get married
- Wow!

977
01:04:38,872 --> 01:04:42,410
Gee, I really love you and we're

978
01:04:42,544 --> 01:04:45,815
Gonna get married

979
01:04:45,915 --> 01:04:51,153
Going to the chapel of love

980
01:04:54,157 --> 01:04:56,427
Spring is here

981
01:04:56,561 --> 01:05:00,232
The sky is blue

982
01:05:00,366 --> 01:05:04,471
Whoa, birds all sing

983
01:05:04,604 --> 01:05:09,175
- As if they knew
- No.

984
01:05:09,275 --> 01:05:13,080
Today's the day

985
01:05:13,214 --> 01:05:15,418
We'll say I do

986
01:05:15,551 --> 01:05:20,423
And we'll never
be lonely any more

987
01:05:20,556 --> 01:05:23,361
All right, Mr Banks.
Here you go.

988
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:26,932
- A 40-long. It's gorgeous
even on the hanger.
- Because we're going to the chapel

989
01:05:27,066 --> 01:05:31,103
- Now this is an actual Giorgio Armani,
the real McCoy.
- And we're gonna get married

990
01:05:31,237 --> 01:05:34,607
- Don't ask how I got it,
but here it is.
- Going to the chapel

991
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:39,814
And we're gonna get married

992
01:05:39,947 --> 01:05:43,686
Gee, I really love you
and we're

993
01:05:43,819 --> 01:05:47,057
Gonna get married

994
01:05:47,157 --> 01:05:53,130
Going to the chapel of love

995
01:05:55,434 --> 01:05:57,636
Bells will ring

996
01:05:57,769 --> 01:06:03,310
The sun will shine, whoa

997
01:06:03,444 --> 01:06:05,779
I'll be his

998
01:06:05,879 --> 01:06:07,682
- Nina, we have great friends,
you know that?
- And he'll be mine

999
01:06:07,816 --> 01:06:11,454
I mean, these are not
your run-of-the-mill salad bowls.
Theses are primo gifts.

1000
01:06:11,553 --> 01:06:14,524
- We'll love until
- As a matter of fact, I am so happy
we have decided to serve...

1001
01:06:14,658 --> 01:06:19,196
- The end of time, and we'll never
- the very chic but exponsive seafoot
at our very foshionable wotting.

1002
01:06:19,329 --> 01:06:21,699
- Be lonely anymore
- Ah! The beautiful bride! Good news!

1003
01:06:21,834 --> 01:06:25,805
You have received another lovely,
too-good-to-be-true silver tea set.

1004
01:06:25,905 --> 01:06:29,142
- What's the matter?
- Send it back.

1005
01:06:29,275 --> 01:06:33,114
- Come on. What do you mean?
- Daddy, I'm not kidding!

1006
01:06:33,214 --> 01:06:35,182
Send them all back.
The wedding's off!

1007
01:06:46,363 --> 01:06:49,667
Anne? Annie?

1008
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:03,484
I'm sorry, Dad,
but I'm not gonna marry Bryan.

1009
01:07:03,584 --> 01:07:07,222
Okay, okay. Whatever you want
is okay with us.

1010
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:11,361
I feel so awful,
after everything you guys have done.

1011
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:14,098
And now
I have to undo it all.

1012
01:07:15,966 --> 01:07:19,604
Don't worry about it. These things
get canceled all the time.

1013
01:07:19,738 --> 01:07:21,708
Your mother and I can
take care of everything.

1014
01:07:21,808 --> 01:07:23,776
Okay.

1015
01:07:30,117 --> 01:07:32,220
What happened?

1016
01:07:35,791 --> 01:07:39,596
- Another girl?
- No.

1017
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:45,937
- Now look at your shirt.
- Don't worry.

1018
01:07:46,071 --> 01:07:49,375
No, it wasn't anything like that.

1019
01:07:49,475 --> 01:07:53,981
It started out as nothing really.
He gave me a present.

1020
01:07:54,115 --> 01:07:57,618
It's our eight-month anniversary
today, and he--

1021
01:07:57,753 --> 01:08:01,758
He gave me-- Just look.

1022
01:08:06,396 --> 01:08:09,968
He said it was for me,
for our apartment.

1023
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:12,337
Just look.

1024
01:08:20,614 --> 01:08:22,783
It's a blender.

1025
01:08:22,883 --> 01:08:25,753
Yeah. Exactly.

1026
01:08:27,189 --> 01:08:32,828
I mean, I didn't want to act thrown
or anything, but inside I was.

1027
01:08:32,962 --> 01:08:35,633
I mean, I thought something
for the apartment. Maybe--

1028
01:08:35,766 --> 01:08:39,837
Maybe a new clock or a cool phone
or a great art book or something.

1029
01:08:39,970 --> 01:08:43,142
But a blender?
I mean, what is this? 1958?

1030
01:08:43,242 --> 01:08:45,978
Give the little wife a blender?

1031
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:50,819
I mean, it scared me, you know.
In terms of his expectations.

1032
01:08:50,918 --> 01:08:53,855
Oh, I started to freak out,
and he asked me what was wrong.

1033
01:08:53,988 --> 01:08:56,357
And I asked him what a gift like this
was supposed to be telling me.

1034
01:08:56,492 --> 01:08:58,861
And he said, "Nothing,"
and I didn't believe him.

1035
01:08:58,994 --> 01:09:03,366
And we got into this big fight.
And he said I was overreacting.

1036
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:08,005
And I said, "Why would I overreact?
Nobody in my family overreacts."

1037
01:09:08,106 --> 01:09:11,577
And then he came up
with this totally absurd story...

1038
01:09:11,710 --> 01:09:14,681
this completely outrageous lie,
and I'm looking at him...

1039
01:09:14,814 --> 01:09:17,283
and I'm thinking,
"This man's a liar!"

1040
01:09:17,417 --> 01:09:20,388
- What did he lie about?
- Oh...

1041
01:09:20,521 --> 01:09:22,958
actually it was
something about you.

1042
01:09:23,091 --> 01:09:25,962
Me?

1043
01:09:26,095 --> 01:09:29,767
He said the day that you and Mom
went to go visit his folks--

1044
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:32,936
It-- This is just--
This is so ridiculous.

1045
01:09:33,070 --> 01:09:36,741
He said that you were snooping
around his-- his dad's desk.

1046
01:09:36,875 --> 01:09:39,578
And that you somehow found
his dad's bankbook--

1047
01:09:39,712 --> 01:09:42,315
Oh, no, no. First he said you broke
some mirror in their bathroom.

1048
01:09:42,449 --> 01:09:45,787
And then you found his dad's bankbook
and you somehow threw it in their pool!

1049
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:49,691
I mean, it's too ridiculous!
The man lies!

1050
01:09:49,792 --> 01:09:51,994
Come in!

1051
01:09:53,862 --> 01:09:55,799
Annie, Bryan's downstairs.

1052
01:09:55,965 --> 01:09:59,136
- I don't want to see him.
- He looks awful.

1053
01:09:59,303 --> 01:10:01,605
Good.

1054
01:10:01,772 --> 01:10:04,142
Excuse me.

1055
01:10:04,309 --> 01:10:06,711
I thought maybe I should help
smooth things over.

1056
01:10:06,878 --> 01:10:08,981
So I took Bryan out for a drink.

1057
01:10:09,115 --> 01:10:13,120
Thought we could
have a talk, man-to-man.

1058
01:10:13,253 --> 01:10:16,156
But as I sat there and listened
to his side of the story...

1059
01:10:16,323 --> 01:10:19,261
I realized this was
a golden opportunity.

1060
01:10:19,428 --> 01:10:23,966
If I ever wanted to get rid
of Bryan MacKenzie, this was my chance.

1061
01:10:24,801 --> 01:10:27,637
You know those banana shakes
she likes to make, right?

1062
01:10:27,771 --> 01:10:30,843
Well, that's why I thought
she'd like a blender.

1063
01:10:31,008 --> 01:10:34,680
I guess I can see her point. I mean,
a blender does suggest a certain...

1064
01:10:34,847 --> 01:10:38,451
1950s reference
to sexual politics, but...

1065
01:10:38,618 --> 01:10:43,157
I swear, it never entered
my consciousness at the time.

1066
01:10:43,324 --> 01:10:46,962
- I believe you.
- You do?

1067
01:10:48,998 --> 01:10:51,334
Would you tell Annie
that for me, Dad?

1068
01:10:51,501 --> 01:10:54,571
This was where I was gonna
lower the boom.

1069
01:10:54,772 --> 01:10:58,643
But instead, I looked into his
weepy eyes and found my self saying--

1070
01:10:58,810 --> 01:11:03,249
- Sure, I'll tell her.
- Oh, good!

1071
01:11:03,415 --> 01:11:06,953
'Cause I know whatever you say
she'll believe.

1072
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:09,055
Not only was I not getting rid
of the kid...

1073
01:11:09,222 --> 01:11:12,193
I now found myself
talking him into staying.

1074
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:15,864
You know, Bryan,
Annie's a very passionate person.

1075
01:11:16,031 --> 01:11:19,869
And passionate people tend
to overreact at time.

1076
01:11:20,003 --> 01:11:24,608
Annie comes from a long line
of major over reactors.

1077
01:11:24,742 --> 01:11:28,013
Me. I can definitely lose it.

1078
01:11:28,146 --> 01:11:30,682
My mother. A nut.

1079
01:11:30,816 --> 01:11:34,253
My grandfather.
Stories about him were legendary.

1080
01:11:36,156 --> 01:11:39,260
The good news, however,
is that this overreacting...

1081
01:11:39,394 --> 01:11:42,464
tends to get proportionately less
by generation.

1082
01:11:42,597 --> 01:11:46,168
So, your kids could be normal.

1083
01:11:49,573 --> 01:11:52,310
As if that wasn't enough,
I went on.

1084
01:11:52,442 --> 01:11:56,414
But on the upside,
with this passion...

1085
01:11:56,547 --> 01:11:59,419
comes great spirit
and individuality...

1086
01:11:59,552 --> 01:12:03,756
which is probably
one of the reasons you love Annie.

1087
01:12:03,890 --> 01:12:06,561
That's what
I love most about her.

1088
01:12:06,661 --> 01:12:09,598
That's when it hit me
like a Mack truck.

1089
01:12:09,731 --> 01:12:14,670
Annie was just like me,
and Bryan was just like Nina.

1090
01:12:14,804 --> 01:12:17,141
They were a perfect match.

1091
01:12:23,214 --> 01:12:25,417
Dad, I can't believe
you took him out. What did he say?

1092
01:12:25,518 --> 01:12:28,054
I mean, you don't
have to tell me. What?

1093
01:12:28,155 --> 01:12:30,924
Honey, I just spent
an hour with Bryan, and...

1094
01:12:31,057 --> 01:12:33,160
believe me
when I tell you that...

1095
01:12:33,293 --> 01:12:36,632
this gift says nothing about
how he feels about you.

1096
01:12:36,765 --> 01:12:40,436
It's just a--
just a thing to put in the kitchen.

1097
01:12:40,537 --> 01:12:43,641
He thought you might want to blend
something one day, and that's all.

1098
01:12:43,774 --> 01:12:47,344
- And you believe that?
- Completely.

1099
01:12:47,478 --> 01:12:52,317
He's-- He's downstairs now. His heart
is breaking. Please go see him.

1100
01:12:55,855 --> 01:12:57,958
And also,
that story he told you...

1101
01:12:58,091 --> 01:13:00,661
about me and the bankbook
and the swimming pool?

1102
01:13:00,794 --> 01:13:02,863
Yeah?

1103
01:13:08,537 --> 01:13:11,808
- What?
- It's-- It's true.

1104
01:13:17,483 --> 01:13:20,419
- Oh, Bryan.
- Oh, Annie.

1105
01:13:20,552 --> 01:13:23,389
Oh.

1106
01:13:23,523 --> 01:13:25,592
I am so sorry
about the blender.

1107
01:13:25,725 --> 01:13:28,362
And I see your point. It w-- It w--
It was incredibly insensitive of me.

1108
01:13:28,496 --> 01:13:30,765
Oh, no, it's okay. I want it.

1109
01:13:30,899 --> 01:13:36,572
Oh, it's my first anniversary present.
I'm-- I'm so sorry
about calling you a worm.

1110
01:13:36,706 --> 01:13:40,009
- My dad told me.
- That's-- When I thought I was never
gonna see you again, I mean--

1111
01:13:40,143 --> 01:13:42,680
- If it wasn't for your father--
- I know. I know.

1112
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:44,883
- I love you.
- You too.

1113
01:13:48,721 --> 01:13:51,757
Everything fine now?

1114
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:02,938
Good. I'll just, uh, uh--

1115
01:14:19,525 --> 01:14:22,362
- Annie!
- Hi, Bryan. What's up?

1116
01:14:22,462 --> 01:14:25,065
- Well, we made it to January.
- Is that for us?

1117
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:28,636
- It was the day before the big day.
- Sure. I'll be out in a sec.

1118
01:14:28,770 --> 01:14:31,374
The Farmer's Almanac predicted this week
was going to be the coldest...

1119
01:14:31,475 --> 01:14:34,110
L.A. had seen
in over half a century.

1120
01:14:34,244 --> 01:14:37,315
But we were so busy,
none of us had time to notice.

1121
01:14:41,954 --> 01:14:44,089
Franck! Franck.
Franck, Franck, Franck.

1122
01:14:45,792 --> 01:14:48,695
Sure, yes. We'll do the whole--
You like it?

1123
01:14:48,828 --> 01:14:50,797
Looks good, yeah.

1124
01:14:50,931 --> 01:14:52,333
Right, together.

1125
01:14:53,468 --> 01:14:56,505
Left, together.
Right, together.

1126
01:14:56,638 --> 01:14:59,876
Left, together.
Right, together.

1127
01:15:00,009 --> 01:15:02,478
Left--

1128
01:15:04,983 --> 01:15:07,952
Right, together.
Left, together.

1129
01:15:08,052 --> 01:15:10,288
Hey, Matty. You're up pretty late,
aren't ya?

1130
01:15:10,421 --> 01:15:13,159
Yeah, I know.
I'm just practicing.

1131
01:15:13,292 --> 01:15:15,595
I wish I didn't have to
walk Mom down the aisle.

1132
01:15:15,695 --> 01:15:18,031
Don't worry. You'll be great.

1133
01:15:18,165 --> 01:15:21,502
Is it right, together, left
or left, together, right?

1134
01:15:21,636 --> 01:15:24,273
Well, let's try it.
Let's see, we go...

1135
01:15:24,373 --> 01:15:28,745
right, together,
left, together.

1136
01:15:28,878 --> 01:15:33,150
Right, together,
left, together.

1137
01:15:33,284 --> 01:15:35,152
Good.

1138
01:15:35,286 --> 01:15:39,224
Matty, I'm sorry if I've been
preoccupied lately with this wedding.

1139
01:15:39,357 --> 01:15:41,895
- It's okay.
- Yeah, but I have, haven't I?

1140
01:15:42,029 --> 01:15:43,897
It's all right.
I understand.

1141
01:15:44,031 --> 01:15:46,834
- Yeah, but--
- Yeah, you have.

1142
01:15:46,934 --> 01:15:49,370
But I haven't felt
ignored or anything.

1143
01:15:49,504 --> 01:15:52,708
Don't worry, Dad.
No permanent damage done.

1144
01:15:52,842 --> 01:15:56,012
- Oh, good.
- It's really cute and cozy.

1145
01:15:56,112 --> 01:15:58,348
And in a great neighborhood.
You'll see it.

1146
01:15:58,481 --> 01:16:00,585
I am really excited.

1147
01:16:00,717 --> 01:16:04,722
I've got all this packing to do,
and this room looks so different.

1148
01:16:06,258 --> 01:16:08,594
It's gonna be weird,
isn't it?

1149
01:16:08,727 --> 01:16:10,663
Just you, me
and Mom here now.

1150
01:16:15,337 --> 01:16:18,139
Yeah. Come on.

1151
01:16:18,273 --> 01:16:20,809
G'night, pal. Sleep tight.

1152
01:16:20,943 --> 01:16:25,082
- Good luck tomorrow, Dad.
- Yeah, you too.

1153
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:27,251
- Annie?
- Yeah?

1154
01:16:27,384 --> 01:16:30,687
- G'night.
- G'night, Matty. I love you.

1155
01:16:30,788 --> 01:16:33,158
I love you too.

1156
01:16:43,871 --> 01:16:48,810
Today I met the boy
I'm gonna marry

1157
01:16:48,944 --> 01:16:53,917
He's all I've wanted
all my life and even more

1158
01:16:54,017 --> 01:16:58,423
He smiled at me and
gee, the music started playing

1159
01:16:58,590 --> 01:17:02,962
"Here Comes The Bride"
when he walked through the door

1160
01:17:04,330 --> 01:17:09,303
Today I met the boy
I'm gonna marry

1161
01:17:09,436 --> 01:17:14,643
The boy whose life and dream
and love I want to share

1162
01:17:14,776 --> 01:17:19,315
For on my hand a band of gold
appeared before me

1163
01:17:19,448 --> 01:17:23,286
The band of gold
I always dreamed I'd wear

1164
01:17:25,323 --> 01:17:30,529
When we kissed
I felt the sweet sensation

1165
01:17:30,696 --> 01:17:35,603
This time it wasn't
just my imagination

1166
01:17:35,703 --> 01:17:40,508
Today I met the boy
I'm gonna marry

1167
01:17:40,674 --> 01:17:45,681
He's just what I've been waiting for
Oh, yes

1168
01:17:45,848 --> 01:17:50,387
With every kiss, oh
"This is it," my heart keeps saying

1169
01:17:50,554 --> 01:17:52,991
Today I met

1170
01:17:53,157 --> 01:17:57,897
The boy I'm going to marry

1171
01:18:50,462 --> 01:18:53,232
- Did I wake you?
- No, no. I was up.

1172
01:18:53,332 --> 01:18:55,400
So, what are you doing?

1173
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,705
I couldn't sleep.

1174
01:19:04,279 --> 01:19:09,318
I just kept thinking about how this was
my last night in my bed, in my house.

1175
01:19:10,653 --> 01:19:13,891
Kind of like
my last night as a kid.

1176
01:19:13,991 --> 01:19:15,960
I mean, I've lived here
since I was five.

1177
01:19:16,094 --> 01:19:20,466
And I feel like I'm supposed
to turn in my key tomorrow.

1178
01:19:20,599 --> 01:19:22,635
It was so strange,
packing up my room.

1179
01:19:22,768 --> 01:19:26,773
You know how you've always trained me
never to throw anything away.

1180
01:19:26,907 --> 01:19:30,511
So, like, I have all these
ratty stuffed animals...

1181
01:19:30,645 --> 01:19:34,116
and yearbooks, my old retainer...

1182
01:19:34,249 --> 01:19:38,254
all my old magic tricks.

1183
01:19:38,354 --> 01:19:41,325
I've actually packed it all.

1184
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:46,398
I just didn't want
to let it go.

1185
01:19:46,531 --> 01:19:50,136
I mean, I know I can't stay.

1186
01:19:52,138 --> 01:19:54,841
But it's like
I don't want to leave.

1187
01:19:56,276 --> 01:20:00,583
Well, that's the thing about life,
is, uh...

1188
01:20:00,716 --> 01:20:02,851
the surprises.

1189
01:20:02,985 --> 01:20:07,824
The little things that sneak up
on you and grab hold of you.

1190
01:20:09,659 --> 01:20:13,898
- It still happens to me.
- Thanks.

1191
01:20:18,771 --> 01:20:21,708
- What is this?
- I don't believe it.

1192
01:20:21,842 --> 01:20:26,915
- Oh, my God! Talk about surprises.
- It hasn't snowed in L.A.
since I was nine.

1193
01:20:27,048 --> 01:20:29,184
Mom's gonna die.

1194
01:20:35,224 --> 01:20:38,096
What? What is that face?

1195
01:20:38,229 --> 01:20:41,467
No. Nothing. I was--
I was just thinking.

1196
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:45,538
Oh, this is gonna end up
costing you more money.

1197
01:20:45,639 --> 01:20:48,275
No.

1198
01:20:48,408 --> 01:20:51,712
How I know I'll remember this moment
for the rest of my life.

1199
01:21:07,666 --> 01:21:09,634
Whee!

1200
01:21:13,272 --> 01:21:16,108
When you live in a city that hasn't
seen snow in 36 years...

1201
01:21:16,242 --> 01:21:18,947
it's bound to cause a few problems.

1202
01:21:20,648 --> 01:21:23,952
First, we panicked
and brought in extra heaters.

1203
01:21:24,085 --> 01:21:27,456
But they were melting
the ice sculptures, so they had to go.

1204
01:21:27,590 --> 01:21:28,792
- Right.
- Yeah?

1205
01:21:28,925 --> 01:21:31,795
- All right. Back in the truck.
- Yeah.

1206
01:21:31,928 --> 01:21:36,234
The florist had to thaw out our
newly planted tulips with a hair dryer.

1207
01:21:39,237 --> 01:21:42,175
Franck and Howard shoveled our path
themselves at no extra charge.

1208
01:21:42,308 --> 01:21:44,245
- Franck?
- Just keep shoveling! Don't stop!

1209
01:21:44,345 --> 01:21:47,314
'Cause they're gonna be here, you know.

1210
01:21:47,448 --> 01:21:50,885
And the swans spent the morning
in a lukewarm bath.

1211
01:21:53,121 --> 01:21:56,260
Other than that, we were
almost running on schedule.

1212
01:21:57,426 --> 01:22:02,000
- Nina, it's after 3:00!
- All I can say is thank God
snow is white.

1213
01:22:02,133 --> 01:22:04,269
- It works. You know what I mean?
- It works.

1214
01:22:04,369 --> 01:22:05,804
Franck, do you have
that needle and thread?

1215
01:22:05,904 --> 01:22:07,606
Here you go, George.
We fix you right up.

1216
01:22:07,706 --> 01:22:10,910
- Howard, you better go to the church!
- On my way.

1217
01:22:11,044 --> 01:22:13,079
Uh-oh. I bring
the wrong kolor thread.

1218
01:22:13,213 --> 01:22:15,716
I assumed you'd be wearing
a black tuxedo.

1219
01:22:15,850 --> 01:22:18,619
- It is a black tuxedo.
- I don't think so, babe.

1220
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:22,291
This tux if nuffy blue.
No doubt about dat. Let me--

1221
01:22:22,391 --> 01:22:25,496
What are you talking about?
Armani doesn't make a blue tuxedo.

1222
01:22:25,629 --> 01:22:27,998
Armani don't also make polyaster.

1223
01:22:30,401 --> 01:22:33,571
Franck, where are the cars?
We're supposed to be there by now.

1224
01:22:33,705 --> 01:22:37,310
Where are dos cares?

1225
01:22:37,410 --> 01:22:42,516
All right. Relax, honey.
Everything's going to be just fine.

1226
01:22:42,649 --> 01:22:46,521
At least we know
they can't start without us.

1227
01:22:46,654 --> 01:22:51,361
I knew I'd never be able to remember
what Nina wore that day.

1228
01:22:51,494 --> 01:22:54,331
But I also knew I'd never forget
the way she looked.

1229
01:23:00,104 --> 01:23:03,108
Nina.

1230
01:23:03,241 --> 01:23:04,877
Thank you, George.

1231
01:23:04,978 --> 01:23:07,380
You shouldn't look this beautiful.
It's not fair to the bride.

1232
01:23:10,251 --> 01:23:12,420
- Cars is here!
- Huh?

1233
01:23:12,554 --> 01:23:14,990
Matthew, frond and cendre!

1234
01:23:17,593 --> 01:23:20,130
- Aw!
- Aw!

1235
01:23:21,999 --> 01:23:24,736
Just kidding.

1236
01:23:24,836 --> 01:23:28,574
- Oh, no.
- What did you do to your hair, honey?

1237
01:23:28,707 --> 01:23:30,409
I gelled it. You don't like it?

1238
01:23:30,542 --> 01:23:32,845
N-- Oh, no, no. I think it--
it looks-- yeah-- cool.

1239
01:23:32,978 --> 01:23:34,981
- Very debonair, my boy.
- Thank you.

1240
01:23:35,115 --> 01:23:37,584
- Okay, we'll go in the first car,
and you and Annie follow.
- Right.

1241
01:23:37,718 --> 01:23:40,721
- George.
- Oh, I follow! I-- Anne!

1242
01:23:45,995 --> 01:23:48,965
Annie?

1243
01:23:49,098 --> 01:23:51,301
I'm ready. Come on in.

1244
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:05,153
- You look beautiful.
- Thanks.

1245
01:24:05,286 --> 01:24:08,856
Okay. Let's get
this show on the road.

1246
01:24:27,981 --> 01:24:31,485
- We're here!
- Oh! Oh, just look!

1247
01:24:31,652 --> 01:24:35,156
- Hi. Oh, Mom.
- Line up, everyone.

1248
01:24:35,256 --> 01:24:37,726
- Mother of the bride.
- Oh, George!

1249
01:24:37,892 --> 01:24:41,063
Coming through! Here we come.
Coming through.

1250
01:24:41,197 --> 01:24:43,699
- Left, together, right, together.
- Got it, Dad.

1251
01:24:43,866 --> 01:24:46,337
- Let me see that.
- See?

1252
01:24:46,504 --> 01:24:49,874
Let's do this. Okay?
I love you.

1253
01:24:50,041 --> 01:24:53,212
- I love you too.
- Mother of the bride.
Mother of the bride. We've gotta go.

1254
01:24:53,345 --> 01:24:55,648
- George.
- Let's go, everybody. Line up.

1255
01:24:55,814 --> 01:24:58,351
It's time. It's time.
Mother of the bride.

1256
01:24:58,518 --> 01:25:01,088
Come on, mother of the bride.
Here we go. I'm opening the doors.

1257
01:25:01,255 --> 01:25:04,526
Natasha, haven't you peeked enough?
Here we go. Come on. Let's go.

1258
01:25:05,761 --> 01:25:08,531
Shh. Okay.

1259
01:25:14,938 --> 01:25:20,445
And left, right.
Very nice. Smile now.

1260
01:25:36,632 --> 01:25:39,235
Right and left.

1261
01:25:39,336 --> 01:25:44,108
Right and very nice and left.

1262
01:25:44,241 --> 01:25:47,446
Right. Keep smiling.

1263
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:56,624
And left. Hey.

1264
01:26:09,172 --> 01:26:13,811
This was the moment I'd been dreading
for the past six months.

1265
01:26:13,945 --> 01:26:17,783
Well, actually,
for the past 22 years.

1266
01:26:29,631 --> 01:26:33,036
- Hold on, Dad.
- Annie overwhelmed me.

1267
01:26:33,169 --> 01:26:37,341
She was as calm and cool as
I'd ever seen her. Very un-Banks-like.

1268
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:44,150
Okay.

1269
01:27:07,878 --> 01:27:11,283
Here you go.

1270
01:27:40,787 --> 01:27:44,290
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
here together...

1271
01:27:44,425 --> 01:27:47,762
in the presence of family,
friends and loved ones...

1272
01:27:47,895 --> 01:27:49,964
for the purpose
of uniting in matrimony--

1273
01:27:50,097 --> 01:27:52,567
All I could think of was the part
I had to play.

1274
01:27:52,668 --> 01:27:57,373
Then suddenly I went blank. I had
one line, and I couldn't remember it.

1275
01:27:57,473 --> 01:27:59,776
When the reverend said,
"Who presents this woman?"...

1276
01:27:59,909 --> 01:28:03,814
was I supposed to say, "That's me,"
or was it, "I do"?

1277
01:28:03,948 --> 01:28:06,419
- ...Forever hold your peace--
- I couldn't think. I felt every eye...

1278
01:28:06,519 --> 01:28:09,956
in the place boring into the back
of my neck, waiting for me to screw up.

1279
01:28:10,090 --> 01:28:12,292
- When suddenly, it was upon me.
- And so I now ask...

1280
01:28:12,426 --> 01:28:16,164
who presents this woman
in holy matrimony?

1281
01:28:16,297 --> 01:28:19,601
I do.

1282
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:24,974
Annie and Bryan, you have come here
today to join your hands--

1283
01:28:25,108 --> 01:28:27,878
- "Who presents this woman?"
- Always remember...

1284
01:28:28,012 --> 01:28:30,648
- This woman.
- this vow of marriage is most solemn...

1285
01:28:30,781 --> 01:28:34,186
- But she's not a woman.
She's just a kid.
- should not be entered into lightly.

1286
01:28:34,319 --> 01:28:40,360
- And she's leaving us.
- With a deep realization of its
obligations and responsibilities.

1287
01:28:40,493 --> 01:28:43,498
I realized at that moment that I was
never going to come home again...

1288
01:28:43,631 --> 01:28:46,167
and see Annie
at the top of the stairs.

1289
01:28:46,301 --> 01:28:48,436
Never going to see her again
at our breakfast table...

1290
01:28:48,536 --> 01:28:51,340
in her nightgown and socks.

1291
01:28:51,474 --> 01:28:54,478
I suddenly realized
what was happening.

1292
01:28:54,578 --> 01:28:58,349
Annie was all grown up
and leaving us.

1293
01:28:58,483 --> 01:29:01,754
And something inside
began to hurt.

1294
01:29:05,525 --> 01:29:08,829
I, Bryan MacKenzie...

1295
01:29:08,929 --> 01:29:10,865
I, Bryan MacKenzie...

1296
01:29:10,998 --> 01:29:14,870
- take thee, Annie Banks...
- take thee, Annie Banks...

1297
01:29:15,003 --> 01:29:18,173
- to be my wedded wife.
- to be my wedded wife.

1298
01:29:18,306 --> 01:29:21,077
To love and to comfort
from this day forward.

1299
01:29:21,210 --> 01:29:24,249
To love and to comfort
from this day forward.

1300
01:29:24,382 --> 01:29:29,220
- I, Annie Banks...
- I, Annie Banks...

1301
01:29:29,354 --> 01:29:32,191
take thee, Bryan MacKenzie...

1302
01:29:32,324 --> 01:29:36,229
- take thee, Bryan MacKenzie...
- to be my lawful wedded husband.

1303
01:29:36,363 --> 01:29:38,633
to be my lawful wedded husband.

1304
01:29:38,766 --> 01:29:41,169
To love and to comfort
from this day forward.

1305
01:29:41,269 --> 01:29:44,273
To love and to comfort
from this day forward.

1306
01:29:44,406 --> 01:29:47,176
The ring, please.

1307
01:29:54,652 --> 01:29:59,959
With this ring as a token of my love
and affection, I thee wed.

1308
01:30:00,093 --> 01:30:05,833
With this ring as a token of my love
and affection, I thee wed.

1309
01:30:09,738 --> 01:30:12,141
Here, sweetie.

1310
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:20,283
With this ring as a token
of my love and affection...

1311
01:30:20,417 --> 01:30:22,587
I thee wed.

1312
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:26,725
With this ring as a token
of my love and affection, I thee wed.

1313
01:30:29,963 --> 01:30:35,102
By virtue of the authority vested in me,
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

1314
01:30:35,202 --> 01:30:37,839
You may kiss the bride.

1315
01:31:15,519 --> 01:31:17,989
Well, she did it.

1316
01:31:18,090 --> 01:31:21,928
And now, as my son said,
it was time to party.

1317
01:31:25,364 --> 01:31:28,268
- Hi, how are you? Good to see you.
Don't you look great?
- Congratulations.

1318
01:31:28,402 --> 01:31:31,906
The house was busting at the seams.
Everywhere I looked, there were faces.

1319
01:31:32,073 --> 01:31:34,909
Most of which, I might add,
I had never seen before.

1320
01:31:35,076 --> 01:31:38,848
- George, I'd like you to meet the
Danish relatives. These are the Prowses.
- Hello!

1321
01:31:38,948 --> 01:31:43,086
I met Bryan's Danish relatives,
who thanked me profusely
for flying them over.

1322
01:31:49,261 --> 01:31:52,665
- Hi. How are you?
- Everyone was telling me
what a great party it was.

1323
01:31:52,831 --> 01:31:55,503
How beautiful the house looked.
They loved the flowers...

1324
01:31:55,669 --> 01:31:57,772
the hors d'oeuvres, the swans.

1325
01:31:57,938 --> 01:32:00,876
We even seemed to be getting away
with only two parking attendants.

1326
01:32:01,042 --> 01:32:04,279
Everything was running smoothly,
except for one small detail.

1327
01:32:04,446 --> 01:32:06,416
- Annie's very favorite uncle.
This is Ben Banks.
- I still hadn't kissed the bride.

1328
01:32:06,582 --> 01:32:08,919
- Congratulations.
- Where's Annie?
- Annie. She's having her picture taken.

1329
01:32:09,086 --> 01:32:10,254
- Hi, Ben.
- How are you, George?

1330
01:32:10,421 --> 01:32:12,957
Yes. Ben's been
back in Connecticut.

1331
01:32:13,124 --> 01:32:17,096
Okay, kids. Look at each other.
Very nice. Now, turn towards me, please.

1332
01:32:19,932 --> 01:32:22,169
I'm sorry, sir. All traffic
has to go through the front door.

1333
01:32:22,335 --> 01:32:25,106
Doris! It's so good to see you!
How are you?

1334
01:32:25,273 --> 01:32:27,975
- Oh, could I have one of those?
- Sorry. Just sold my last one.

1335
01:32:28,142 --> 01:32:30,879
Hey, a button. It's navy.
This must be yours.

1336
01:32:33,183 --> 01:32:36,787
We're moving into the tent now.
Dinner is served.

1337
01:32:36,921 --> 01:32:39,256
This way to the tent, please.

1338
01:32:41,425 --> 01:32:45,597
- Uh, let's--
I think we have to go back in--
- Ann-- Annie!

1339
01:32:45,730 --> 01:32:47,667
As well, I--

1340
01:32:51,605 --> 01:32:56,377
It was unbelievable.
I had never seen a line form so fast.

1341
01:32:56,511 --> 01:33:00,149
It was as if they knew
what the food was costing me.

1342
01:33:02,819 --> 01:33:05,055
Finally,
I made it into the tent.

1343
01:33:11,396 --> 01:33:13,633
I was ready to relax and taste
the food I'd been hearing about...

1344
01:33:13,767 --> 01:33:15,502
for the past five months, when--

1345
01:33:15,635 --> 01:33:19,874
Dad! Dad! There's some cops out front,
and they want to talk to you!

1346
01:33:20,007 --> 01:33:22,810
- Cops?
- I've heard. We'll handle dis togather.

1347
01:33:22,943 --> 01:33:24,880
I got George. Ve're on our vay.

1348
01:33:25,013 --> 01:33:27,183
Come on, George.
Pick it up. Pick it up.

1349
01:33:29,986 --> 01:33:31,822
One-Adam-seventy, roger.
Standby.

1350
01:33:31,955 --> 01:33:34,425
Let me handle this, George.
Give me your wallet.

1351
01:33:34,558 --> 01:33:36,428
Stop!

1352
01:33:36,561 --> 01:33:40,498
- Adam-30, disregard.
- What is this?

1353
01:33:40,598 --> 01:33:44,805
- See, Cameron? I told ya.
- Wow!

1354
01:33:44,905 --> 01:33:47,408
Just try to smile. That's all.

1355
01:33:47,542 --> 01:33:49,744
- This your house?
- Me?

1356
01:33:49,877 --> 01:33:53,582
Yeah, you. In the blue tux.

1357
01:33:53,715 --> 01:33:58,756
- Yes. Yes, it is.
- Do you have a permit for parking
200 cars in this street?

1358
01:33:58,888 --> 01:34:04,296
Vell, the-- the problem is, Officer,
dat we are supposed to haf
four parking attendants.

1359
01:34:04,429 --> 01:34:06,898
- Uh, but two got de flu.
- Well, you better get...

1360
01:34:07,032 --> 01:34:10,001
all these cars off this street
before the fire marshall gets here.

1361
01:34:10,103 --> 01:34:12,239
Fine, fine. Any sugjoostions
what we do with them?

1362
01:34:12,372 --> 01:34:15,409
I don't care what you do with them.
Just have them off this street
within the next 30 minutes.

1363
01:34:15,542 --> 01:34:18,947
Vill do, sir. Ve'll take care of it.
You're not to worry, okay?

1364
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:21,851
- Franck? Where are you? The cake--
- Uh, uh, George. They need me inside.

1365
01:34:21,951 --> 01:34:24,621
Uh, the big moment.
The keck is being wheeled out!

1366
01:34:24,753 --> 01:34:28,625
- I-- I-- I'll handle this.
- I'm on my vay!

1367
01:34:28,758 --> 01:34:31,429
Where're we gonna get
a couple extra drivers?

1368
01:34:51,888 --> 01:34:54,358
Yes!

1369
01:34:59,597 --> 01:35:01,534
Whoa!

1370
01:35:07,140 --> 01:35:09,276
By the way,
great wedding, Mr Banks.

1371
01:35:09,376 --> 01:35:12,146
And don't worry!
I didn't eat anything!

1372
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:17,152
That makes two of us.

1373
01:35:20,290 --> 01:35:23,327
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

1374
01:36:06,714 --> 01:36:12,155
I know.

1375
01:36:49,433 --> 01:36:51,102
Well, I had to admit...

1376
01:36:51,236 --> 01:36:54,139
the wedding appeared to be
a complete success.

1377
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:57,310
Now, all I needed to make me happy
was a dance with the bride.

1378
01:36:57,443 --> 01:37:01,014
- It's time.
- Ladies and gentlemen...

1379
01:37:01,148 --> 01:37:05,854
in just a few moments,
Mrs Annie Banks-MacKenzie will be
tossing her bouquet in the foyer.

1380
01:37:05,987 --> 01:37:08,290
- And then she's off to Hawaii.
- Let's go in there. Oh, sorry.

1381
01:37:08,424 --> 01:37:11,627
- Excuse me. Thank you.
- This I was not going to miss.

1382
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:14,298
- Coming through.
- The mob was headed
through the living room...

1383
01:37:14,432 --> 01:37:17,835
- so I decided to take a shortcut.
- Sorry.

1384
01:37:17,969 --> 01:37:19,804
- Excuse me. Thank you.
- Great wedding, George!

1385
01:37:19,937 --> 01:37:22,308
- Had a lovely time.
- Thanks. Excuse me.
- Great party, George.

1386
01:37:22,442 --> 01:37:24,711
Hurry up!

1387
01:37:29,150 --> 01:37:31,051
Whoa! Ay-yi-yi-yi!

1388
01:37:32,654 --> 01:37:34,856
Whoo!

1389
01:37:46,738 --> 01:37:49,140
- Where's my dad?
- I-- I-- I don't know.

1390
01:37:49,274 --> 01:37:54,047
- I haven't seen him.
- Watch it. Behind you.

1391
01:37:54,181 --> 01:37:56,216
Excuse me.

1392
01:37:58,986 --> 01:38:02,391
- Should I throw it?
- Yeah! Yes!

1393
01:38:06,629 --> 01:38:08,364
He missed it.

1394
01:38:11,836 --> 01:38:14,105
- Bye-bye!
- Let us through. Let us--

1395
01:38:19,212 --> 01:38:22,048
Bye!

1396
01:38:22,181 --> 01:38:24,218
Goodbye, Charlie!

1397
01:38:24,351 --> 01:38:26,320
Bye, Bryan!

1398
01:38:28,423 --> 01:38:29,891
- Bye!
- Bye!
- Thanks.

1399
01:38:30,024 --> 01:38:32,762
- Bye!
- Have fun!

1400
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:40,404
She was gone.
My Annie was gone...

1401
01:38:40,538 --> 01:38:43,775
and I was too late
to say goodbye.

1402
01:39:04,067 --> 01:39:05,435
When the last guest was gone...

1403
01:39:05,569 --> 01:39:08,473
and the last glass of champagne
had been drunk...

1404
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:10,942
we surveyed the damage.

1405
01:39:20,988 --> 01:39:23,892
It's funny how empty a house
can suddenly get, isn't it?

1406
01:39:24,026 --> 01:39:28,797
Yeah. I'm sorry you didn't get a chance
to say goodbye to her, George.

1407
01:39:28,964 --> 01:39:32,036
Oh, that's all right.

1408
01:39:32,203 --> 01:39:35,207
But, you know, I think she's going
to be really happy.

1409
01:39:35,373 --> 01:39:39,178
Oh, yeah. Sure.

1410
01:39:50,592 --> 01:39:53,395
- Hello?
- Dad!

1411
01:39:53,529 --> 01:39:56,332
Hi! Where are you?

1412
01:39:56,465 --> 01:39:58,334
At the airport.
Our plane's about to take off...

1413
01:39:58,467 --> 01:40:00,938
but I couldn't leave
without saying goodbye.

1414
01:40:01,038 --> 01:40:04,075
Thank Mom for everything, okay?

1415
01:40:04,208 --> 01:40:06,678
And Dad...

1416
01:40:06,812 --> 01:40:08,815
I love you.

1417
01:40:08,948 --> 01:40:12,218
I love you very much.

1418
01:40:12,353 --> 01:40:14,321
I love you too, sweetheart.

1419
01:40:14,421 --> 01:40:18,627
Thanks for calling.
And have a great honeymoon.

1420
01:40:18,727 --> 01:40:23,032
Thanks. I will. Bye.

1421
01:40:32,043 --> 01:40:35,848
That was Annie.

1422
01:40:36,305 --> 01:40:42,400
