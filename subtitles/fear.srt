2
00:01:30,849 --> 00:01:34,046
Nicole,
save some hot water for your dad!

3
00:01:54,506 --> 00:01:56,667
- Mr. Walker.
- Larry.

4
00:02:23,869 --> 00:02:26,804
I've eaten meaner dogs than you
for breakfast, you wimp!

5
00:02:30,842 --> 00:02:33,902
Did you get the tickets yesterday?

6
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:37,745
- The Pier? James Taylor?
- Shit!

7
00:02:37,816 --> 00:02:39,841
I'll have Eddie get 'em today.

8
00:02:44,723 --> 00:02:47,214
- What?
- Nothin'.

9
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:51,160
Dad, you're looking at me like you
didn't know who I was or something.

10
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:53,891
No, no, no. I was just thinking
that maybe you'd...

11
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:56,024
like Laura to take you
to buy new clothes.

12
00:02:56,101 --> 00:02:58,729
What she's got on is brand-new.

13
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:02,467
- This is new?
- Yeah. Why? What's wrong with it?

14
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:05,203
It looks like something you wore
when you were 12.

15
00:03:05,277 --> 00:03:07,711
- Yeah, so?
- Look.

16
00:03:07,779 --> 00:03:10,475
All I'm saying
is that it's... it's...

17
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:13,109
What? I'm not allowed
to have an opinion?

18
00:03:13,185 --> 00:03:15,779
No, Dad, you're allowed to do
whatever you want to do.

19
00:03:15,854 --> 00:03:18,379
I'm the one who has to ask
permission to breathe.

20
00:03:18,457 --> 00:03:20,482
Can I go to school now, Father?

21
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:22,493
Have a nice day, Nicole.

22
00:03:25,096 --> 00:03:27,291
Does that count
as quality time?

23
00:03:32,571 --> 00:03:36,132
- Good boy, Kaiser.
- Drink all your juice, sweetheart.

24
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:39,143
- Congratulations. I heard you won your game last night.
- Spanked 'em.

25
00:03:39,211 --> 00:03:42,578
- I bet that made your dad happy.
- He doesn't really watch the games.

26
00:03:42,647 --> 00:03:44,581
He's too busy trying
to pick up chicks.

27
00:03:47,986 --> 00:03:50,819
I gotta go.

28
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:53,619
Could you drop me off
at school?

29
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,320
The Mustang's way cooler
than Mom's car.

30
00:03:57,496 --> 00:03:59,657
Please, Dad.

31
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,667
- Okay, hurry up. Get your stuff.
- All right!

32
00:04:08,607 --> 00:04:10,632
He called me "Dad."

33
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:19,993
Morning, Eddie.

34
00:04:20,061 --> 00:04:23,224
The Sweikert project
went to the bad guys last night.

35
00:04:23,298 --> 00:04:25,232
- You're shittin' me.
- Wish I were.

36
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,566
We're on thin ice here, pal.
Vancouver or bust.

37
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:33,471
Show me the drafts we got.
I'll create the presentation myself.

38
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,271
- That's what I wanted to hear.
- We shouldn't be doing this.

39
00:04:36,344 --> 00:04:39,245
We're just gonna have to turn around and
come back the second we get there.

40
00:04:39,314 --> 00:04:42,647
Yes, but we can say we were there.
Factor in the residual coolness.

41
00:04:42,717 --> 00:04:46,118
Sorry. Mr. Keheela had to stare
at my boobs for 10 minutes...

42
00:04:46,187 --> 00:04:48,485
before he'd give me
an extension.

43
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,559
We should just get
something to go, guys.

44
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:55,619
Nicole, chill. What do you want
to remember five years from now?

45
00:04:55,697 --> 00:04:58,325
Being on time for English Lit
or having a life?

46
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,698
Well, let me see.
English Lit, life.

47
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:02,703
- English Lit.
- Shut up, Gary.

48
00:05:12,781 --> 00:05:15,716
Come along and take a ride.

49
00:05:15,784 --> 00:05:17,718
With the one that's got a life.

50
00:05:17,786 --> 00:05:20,152
Just leave your cares behind.

51
00:05:20,221 --> 00:05:22,621
Right now it's party time.

52
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,920
Come along and take a ride.

53
00:05:24,993 --> 00:05:27,223
With the one that's got a life.

54
00:05:27,295 --> 00:05:29,729
Just leave your cares behind.

55
00:05:29,798 --> 00:05:34,235
- Right now it's party time.
- Yo, get up, stand up Put your hands up.

56
00:05:34,302 --> 00:05:38,238
In the air like you just don't care
You can put down your gun.

57
00:05:38,306 --> 00:05:40,240
Yes?

58
00:05:40,308 --> 00:05:42,299
- Smoked turkey and gouda on a roll.
- To go.

59
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:46,643
So pretty? Davey,
you see me hole that?

60
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,418
God, stop being so obvious.
What do you wanna eat?

61
00:05:51,486 --> 00:05:54,250
Just some
chocolate cake, please.

62
00:05:54,322 --> 00:05:56,256
- To go.
- To go.

63
00:05:56,324 --> 00:05:59,816
Swing and a miss. You're outta
here, buddy. Batter up, Davey.

64
00:06:10,271 --> 00:06:12,569
Come along and take a ride.

65
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,835
With the one that's got a life.

66
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:17,434
Just leave your cares behind.

67
00:06:17,512 --> 00:06:19,946
Right now it's party time.

68
00:06:20,014 --> 00:06:22,380
Winning is a good thing, man.

69
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,384
This is what we're gonna do.

70
00:06:24,452 --> 00:06:26,079
We'll leave the guns
and the knives at home.

71
00:06:26,154 --> 00:06:29,783
We'll only get busy on the microphone
with no static.

72
00:06:29,858 --> 00:06:32,418
- "King and Occidental"?
- I'm there.

73
00:06:32,494 --> 00:06:34,553
- Down by the docks?
- Yeah. So?

74
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:36,722
- Better bring your Uzi.
- That's $8.75.

75
00:06:36,798 --> 00:06:38,732
- I got it.
- Come with me.

76
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,735
I can't. I've got a family outing.
James Taylor at the Pier.

77
00:06:41,803 --> 00:06:45,239
- Yikes! Isn't he bald?
- Probably.

78
00:06:45,306 --> 00:06:48,434
Gotta go, guys.

79
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,944
Margo, come on.

80
00:06:51,012 --> 00:06:52,946
All right, all right.

81
00:06:57,318 --> 00:06:59,616
It won't stop
It won't ever quit.

82
00:06:59,687 --> 00:07:02,781
'Cause wild-ass kids
are for the bids.

83
00:07:02,857 --> 00:07:05,451
Sick and tired of
killin' one another.

84
00:07:05,527 --> 00:07:07,791
Each man teachin' one
that we'll all be brothers.

85
00:07:07,862 --> 00:07:12,060
- God, I'd bet it'd be a rush.
- You wouldn't really do it.

86
00:07:13,735 --> 00:07:15,669
Why not?

87
00:07:15,737 --> 00:07:19,070
Who wouldn't want millions
of guys fantasizing about them?

88
00:07:22,544 --> 00:07:25,741
- It's power.
- It's nuts.

89
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:28,873
What, it doesn't
feel good to be wanted?

90
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:32,078
Hey, what about Jason Fuller?
He wants you bad.

91
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:35,455
He doesn't want me. He just...

92
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:38,985
I don't really know
what he wants.

93
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,858
Every time I go out with him, I feel
like I should be paid for baby-sitting.

94
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:48,024
Come with me tonight. There's sure
to be something going on down there.

95
00:07:48,102 --> 00:07:50,900
I told you, I gotta
do this family thing.

96
00:07:50,972 --> 00:07:54,203
I'm leaving now. There's food in
the fridge and money on the counter.

97
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:58,211
If you need to reach me, I'll be at the
St. Francis under Vince's name, okay?

98
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,975
- Okay, Mom.
- Be good. Love you.

99
00:08:02,717 --> 00:08:05,345
- Who's Vince?
- Some old coot in San Francisco...

100
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,354
with a potbelly
and a lotta dough.

101
00:08:07,422 --> 00:08:10,414
He promised her a Mercedes.

102
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:14,222
Which means I get the Rabbit.
Don't you just love life?

103
00:08:14,295 --> 00:08:17,423
Nicole?
Your father's here to pick you up.

104
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:20,228
Oh, yeah. Life's just great.

105
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:23,737
- Dad?
- Daughter.

106
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:27,833
Is it absolutely mandatory
that I see James Taylor again?

107
00:08:30,712 --> 00:08:32,737
When did you ever see
a James Taylor concert?

108
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:36,940
You, me, Mom, summer of '85.

109
00:08:37,018 --> 00:08:40,476
- Does that ring any bells?
- '85?

110
00:08:40,555 --> 00:08:42,716
- You'd have been...
- Six.

111
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,418
That doesn't count.
I'm surprised you even remember it.

112
00:08:46,828 --> 00:08:49,126
I don't think there's a thing
that's ever happened...

113
00:08:49,197 --> 00:08:52,428
or not happened, for that matter...
that I don't remember.

114
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,991
You're the one
who blocks out the past.

115
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,800
Nicole, I don't
block out anything.

116
00:08:58,873 --> 00:09:03,276
It just takes longer
to sort through 40 years of data...

117
00:09:03,344 --> 00:09:05,278
than it does 16.

118
00:09:05,346 --> 00:09:07,678
Maybe you oughta
consider upgrading to a faster chip.

119
00:09:11,753 --> 00:09:13,721
You know, sometimes
you're pretty funny.

120
00:09:13,788 --> 00:09:17,724
- I have my moments.
- It'll be fun tonight.

121
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:20,727
You, me, Laura. Toby.

122
00:09:20,795 --> 00:09:24,595
Old memories, new adventures...
It'll be like real life.

123
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:28,727
Okay, my little sugar plum?

124
00:09:30,004 --> 00:09:31,938
Okay, my little nectarine.

125
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,702
- Hey, Laura.
- Hey.

126
00:09:35,777 --> 00:09:38,075
Want me to help with anything?

127
00:09:38,146 --> 00:09:41,877
Yeah. There's
fruit in the refrigerator.

128
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:44,213
- Why don't you get that out? Thanks.
- Okay.

129
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,559
Get outta there!

130
00:09:52,627 --> 00:09:54,561
I gotta change
and jump in the shower.

131
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:57,757
Call Eddie first. He was looking for you.

132
00:09:57,832 --> 00:10:01,290
Come on. Not even a nice, schmoozy
conference call? Please.

133
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:07,907
All right.

134
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:10,409
What choice do I have?
I'll see you at the airport.

135
00:10:13,815 --> 00:10:17,751
She's got this little chain she hooks
through it and wraps around her waist.

136
00:10:17,819 --> 00:10:20,617
- What would Dad do if I got one?
- You know exactly what he would do.

137
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:22,679
- Bullet to the brain.
- Toby.

138
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:26,960
What?

139
00:10:27,028 --> 00:10:28,962
I can't go to the concert.
I gotta go to Vancouver.

140
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,521
- Now?
- I have to meet the client for dinner in three hours.

141
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:34,193
Oh, Jesus, Steven.
We've been planning this for weeks.

142
00:10:34,268 --> 00:10:37,260
- The whole thing was your idea.
- Honey, nobody wanted to go more than me.

143
00:10:37,338 --> 00:10:40,671
- What would you like me to do about it?
- Keep your word to your family.

144
00:10:40,742 --> 00:10:43,006
Oh, yeah? Then we can
just all starve to death.

145
00:10:43,077 --> 00:10:46,444
- Spare me the melodrama. Nobody's starving.
- You were right, Dad.

146
00:10:46,514 --> 00:10:48,607
It's just like real life.

147
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,254
Margo.

148
00:11:03,322 --> 00:11:05,882
King and Occidental?
I'm with ya.

149
00:11:52,305 --> 00:11:54,205
There's that guy from Largo!

150
00:11:56,809 --> 00:11:58,743
Let's go say hi.

151
00:11:58,811 --> 00:12:01,211
Nah, I think I'll just be
over here, okay?

152
00:12:26,472 --> 00:12:28,406
Hey.

153
00:12:30,543 --> 00:12:32,477
Hi.

154
00:12:32,545 --> 00:12:35,105
You're not dancing.

155
00:12:35,181 --> 00:12:37,172
I know.

156
00:12:45,758 --> 00:12:48,249
You aren't either.

157
00:12:52,598 --> 00:12:55,931
- How come?
- How come what?

158
00:12:56,002 --> 00:12:58,402
How come you're not dancing?

159
00:12:59,505 --> 00:13:01,666
Well, because
nobody's asked me.

160
00:13:16,422 --> 00:13:18,982
Come on!

161
00:13:25,031 --> 00:13:27,124
Hey, come on.
Let's get outta here.

162
00:13:47,353 --> 00:13:49,821
Logan!

163
00:13:57,163 --> 00:13:59,222
Logan, come on!

164
00:14:03,002 --> 00:14:04,936
Are you all right?

165
00:14:05,004 --> 00:14:07,495
Yeah. How we gonna get down?

166
00:14:07,573 --> 00:14:09,507
I'll figure somethin' out.

167
00:14:11,544 --> 00:14:13,171
Hold on.

168
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:19,350
Come on.

169
00:14:27,626 --> 00:14:30,720
Come on.

170
00:14:30,796 --> 00:14:33,094
I promise. It'll be okay.
It's safe. Come on.

171
00:14:42,441 --> 00:14:44,875
Margo!

172
00:14:44,944 --> 00:14:48,505
I'll see ya later! Come on!

173
00:14:54,653 --> 00:14:56,951
Go ahead. Just let go.

174
00:14:58,324 --> 00:15:00,884
It's safe. Come on.

175
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:36,056
Isn't this the car they stopped making 'cause
it, I don't know, blows up or something?

176
00:15:37,897 --> 00:15:40,161
I guess that's why I got her.

177
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:44,259
I saw her sittin' there all alone,
cold in the junkyard.

178
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:50,136
You know, it's not her fault
they didn't put her together right.

179
00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:53,076
You just said that
like you really meant it.

180
00:15:53,145 --> 00:15:55,579
I did.

181
00:16:05,024 --> 00:16:07,993
I stayed with my real mom
in L.A. After my dad moved up here.

182
00:16:09,695 --> 00:16:11,629
I was nine years old.

183
00:16:13,365 --> 00:16:16,334
It was just the two of us,
all alone in this big house.

184
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:23,230
She was so sad most of the time that I felt
like I was the one taking care of her.

185
00:16:23,309 --> 00:16:25,277
Must've been tough.

186
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:30,873
Yeah.

187
00:16:32,952 --> 00:16:36,820
How 'bout your dad?
You get along with him okay?

188
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:40,017
I don't know. I only moved
up here about a year ago.

189
00:16:40,092 --> 00:16:42,026
It's not like we even know
each other that well.

190
00:16:42,094 --> 00:16:44,892
Yeah.

191
00:16:44,964 --> 00:16:47,432
How 'bout you?
You have parents?

192
00:16:49,535 --> 00:16:51,560
- I mean, that you see and stuff.
- Yeah.

193
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:54,572
They're back East,
but I talk to them all the time.

194
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,268
Are they still together?

195
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,402
They're weird, though.

196
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:02,276
I mean, they're totally cool,
totally together.

197
00:17:02,348 --> 00:17:05,283
It's just that they've never had a
disagreement about anything more serious...

198
00:17:05,351 --> 00:17:09,720
than whether it's gonna be
mashed or Stove-Top, or tea or coffee.

199
00:17:09,788 --> 00:17:12,552
Kinda crazy.

200
00:17:15,461 --> 00:17:17,929
- What?
- Nothing.

201
00:17:17,997 --> 00:17:21,763
That was not "nothing" going on
behind those beautiful eyes of yours.

202
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:23,893
Tell me.

203
00:17:26,138 --> 00:17:29,198
I was just thinking that,

204
00:17:29,275 --> 00:17:33,371
you're not at all what I expected
you to be the first time I saw you.

205
00:17:33,445 --> 00:17:35,379
How so?

206
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,551
I don't know. You're just...

207
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:42,553
You're sweet.

208
00:17:44,623 --> 00:17:48,218
What? You're the one
that's hiding something.

209
00:17:50,462 --> 00:17:55,399
It's just that I was taught that if
something seems too good to be true,

210
00:17:55,467 --> 00:17:57,628
then it probably isn't.

211
00:17:57,703 --> 00:17:59,466
Yeah.

212
00:17:59,538 --> 00:18:03,133
So far what I know about you
is you're beautiful...

213
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:06,367
and incredibly perceptive.

214
00:18:06,445 --> 00:18:10,472
I just need to know like one flaw
so I can believe the rest.

215
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:14,485
- Got a week?
- I got all the time in the world.

216
00:18:18,357 --> 00:18:20,985
David.

217
00:18:22,094 --> 00:18:24,528
I gotta go.
My curfew's at midnight.

218
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:35,473
All the time in the world.

219
00:19:00,999 --> 00:19:02,933
David.

220
00:19:04,303 --> 00:19:06,464
I'm sorry.

221
00:19:06,538 --> 00:19:09,132
I guess you found my flaw.

222
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,506
That's not a flaw.

223
00:19:11,577 --> 00:19:14,603
That's one more perfect thing
for me to admire.

224
00:19:16,014 --> 00:19:18,005
And respect.

225
00:19:19,418 --> 00:19:21,352
And wait for.

226
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:25,552
The least you could have done
was call, Nicole.

227
00:19:25,624 --> 00:19:29,116
I was sitting here for two hours
imagining God knows what.

228
00:19:29,194 --> 00:19:32,027
Laura, I can't help it
if my watch broke.

229
00:19:32,097 --> 00:19:36,329
I mean, how would I even notice unless
I was staring at it every second.

230
00:19:36,402 --> 00:19:39,030
Go to bed, Nicole.
We'll deal with this tomorrow.

231
00:19:39,104 --> 00:19:41,368
- Laura...
- I'm angry, Nicole. Just go to bed.

232
00:19:43,876 --> 00:19:46,504
And take off your makeup.
You look like a slut.

233
00:19:54,586 --> 00:19:57,054
- Mr. Walker.
- Larry.

234
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:04,053
So, 2:00 a.m.
Am I missin' somethin'?

235
00:20:05,964 --> 00:20:08,159
Come on, Nicky. Help me out.

236
00:20:08,233 --> 00:20:10,167
Your were kidnapped by aliens.

237
00:20:10,235 --> 00:20:14,171
They tried to take you to their planet, but
you escaped and hitchhiked back from Pluto.

238
00:20:20,245 --> 00:20:24,045
- So who's this guy you were with?
- Just a guy.

239
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:28,953
- Is he a good guy?
- He's good to his car.

240
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:32,115
You'd appreciate that.

241
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:34,625
Well, that's a start.
Maybe I should meet him.

242
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:37,184
I just met him. I don't know if
I'm gonna see him again.

243
00:20:39,465 --> 00:20:41,296
So?

244
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:43,630
Right.

245
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:45,727
All right, here's the deal.

246
00:20:47,139 --> 00:20:50,438
Kitchen duty and yard work
for two weeks. No exceptions.

247
00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:53,876
And no subcontracting out
to Tobias.

248
00:20:53,946 --> 00:20:55,880
- Is that fair?
- Do I have a choice?

249
00:20:55,948 --> 00:20:58,610
- No.
- I guess it's fair.

250
00:20:58,684 --> 00:21:02,279
And... I want you
to apologize to Laura.

251
00:21:02,354 --> 00:21:07,621
Yeah. I'll apologize to her when she
apologizes to me for calling me a slut.

252
00:21:11,497 --> 00:21:14,864
You were too easy on her.
She should have been grounded.

253
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:17,026
She knows she screwed up.

254
00:21:17,102 --> 00:21:19,764
It's all easy fixes
with you, Steve.

255
00:21:19,838 --> 00:21:22,807
You give her whatever she wants, like
you're forever trying to make it up to her.

256
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,002
Please, Laura.

257
00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:27,739
It's gonna blow up
in your face, Steve.

258
00:21:27,813 --> 00:21:32,750
Everybody needs rules. She'd respect you more
if you laid it out and played it straight.

259
00:21:32,818 --> 00:21:36,584
Straight? Is that why
you called her a slut?

260
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,815
I said she looked like a slut.

261
00:21:40,893 --> 00:21:44,329
She had about two gallons of makeup on.
That's exactly what she looked like.

262
00:21:44,396 --> 00:21:46,421
Shitty choice of words,
don't you think?

263
00:21:46,498 --> 00:21:49,695
Maybe.

264
00:22:02,885 --> 00:22:05,786
Love and hate Get it wrong.

265
00:22:05,855 --> 00:22:09,689
Just cut me right back
down to size.

266
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:13,160
Sleep through the day
Let it fade.

267
00:22:13,229 --> 00:22:17,029
Who was there
to take your place.

268
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:19,897
No one knows Never will.

269
00:22:19,969 --> 00:22:23,496
Mostly me but mostly you.

270
00:22:23,572 --> 00:22:27,064
Do you say Do you do.

271
00:22:27,143 --> 00:22:30,203
When it all comes down.

272
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:34,375
'Cause I don't wanna come back
down from this cloud.

273
00:22:35,618 --> 00:22:37,779
It's taken me all this time.

274
00:22:37,853 --> 00:22:41,118
To find out what I need Yeah

275
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,620
I don't wanna come back down
from this cloud.

276
00:22:49,131 --> 00:22:53,932
It's taken me all this
all this time.

277
00:22:54,003 --> 00:22:56,995
You know, every part
of you tastes so good.

278
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,148
- Nicole?
- Yeah?

279
00:23:06,215 --> 00:23:09,241
I wanna meet your family.

280
00:23:09,318 --> 00:23:11,809
- Really?
- Yeah. Will that be okay?

281
00:23:12,922 --> 00:23:14,856
Yeah.

282
00:23:16,592 --> 00:23:18,651
Dad, meet David McCall.

283
00:23:20,062 --> 00:23:22,997
Mr. Walker.
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

284
00:23:23,065 --> 00:23:24,862
Same here, David.

285
00:23:24,934 --> 00:23:27,994
Hey, Toby, right?
What's up, big guy?

286
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:31,096
This must be
the savage beast Kaiser.

287
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:35,935
That means he likes ya.

288
00:23:36,011 --> 00:23:38,411
Yeah? Tell him
the feeling is mutual.

289
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,971
You know, you look bigger
than your sister described.

290
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:44,417
Or maybe you just grew
since yesterday. Which one?

291
00:23:44,486 --> 00:23:47,216
So, David, you're not
in school with Nicole, are you?

292
00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:51,123
No, sir.
But maybe U-Doub in the fall.

293
00:23:51,193 --> 00:23:53,787
I'm just kinda explorin'
my options, I guess.

294
00:23:53,863 --> 00:23:56,855
Nicole, remember you gotta help me
plant these trees before you leave.

295
00:23:56,932 --> 00:23:59,526
But I gotta get changed.

296
00:23:59,602 --> 00:24:01,934
Well, you knew it was
one of your chores.

297
00:24:02,004 --> 00:24:03,938
Excuse me. It's Laura, right?

298
00:24:04,006 --> 00:24:06,236
Hi, I'm David. I...

299
00:24:06,308 --> 00:24:10,642
I don't wanna interfere, but it so
happens I work summers in a nursery.

300
00:24:10,713 --> 00:24:13,580
- I'd be happy to give you a hand.
- Can I help too?

301
00:24:13,649 --> 00:24:17,449
I couldn't do it
without you, partner.

302
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:19,612
Okay. Come on.
Grab the big one.

303
00:24:19,688 --> 00:24:24,182
The main thing is the moisture content
of the soil when you first plant it.

304
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,455
These guys' roots are really sensitive
for about ten days.

305
00:24:26,528 --> 00:24:31,158
Well, you certainly learned
a lot during your summer, didn't you?

306
00:24:38,941 --> 00:24:42,536
Is there someplace
I can get cleaned up?

307
00:24:42,611 --> 00:24:46,547
I don't know. Hard-earned dirt under
a man's fingernails can be attractive.

308
00:24:46,615 --> 00:24:48,583
Maybe I shouldn't wash.

309
00:24:48,651 --> 00:24:50,585
- It's in there, on your left.
- Thanks.

310
00:24:50,653 --> 00:24:53,144
Oh, excuse me, Mr. Walker.
I was looking for the bathroom.

311
00:24:53,222 --> 00:24:55,122
It's right in there.

312
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:57,454
- I'm not disturbing you, am I?
- No, no. Go ahead.

313
00:24:57,526 --> 00:24:59,790
Thank you.

314
00:25:00,863 --> 00:25:02,854
Did David come in here?

315
00:25:02,932 --> 00:25:05,025
- I'll be right out.
- Margo.

316
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,694
Come on in. Tell me about life.

317
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:12,764
Mr. Walker, I'm sure you know
a lot more about life than I do.

318
00:25:12,841 --> 00:25:14,934
I wouldn't be so sure.
I get surprised at least once a day.

319
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:17,877
- That's the fun part, though, isn't it, Mr. Walker?
- Depends, David.

320
00:25:17,947 --> 00:25:21,439
Kinda cuts both ways.
You just never know.

321
00:25:21,517 --> 00:25:24,509
- Two minutes.
- Those trash bags have to go out.

322
00:25:24,586 --> 00:25:27,783
- You're not gettin' out of that.
- All right.

323
00:25:27,856 --> 00:25:30,450
You should come with us
to the Orbit. It'd be fun.

324
00:25:31,927 --> 00:25:34,691
- Nicole! Get me a Coke.
- Yeah?

325
00:25:34,763 --> 00:25:36,822
Okay, I'll be right there.

326
00:25:36,899 --> 00:25:41,427
Come on, Steve.
You could play pinball.

327
00:25:41,503 --> 00:25:44,370
You could ride the bumper cars.

328
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,898
You could do that thing where
you throw the ball at something...

329
00:25:47,977 --> 00:25:51,504
And maybe win me a stuffed animal.

330
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,344
Or you could just walk around,

331
00:25:54,416 --> 00:25:57,214
eating cotton candy,
checking everybody out.

332
00:25:58,821 --> 00:26:01,847
Hey, thank you.
You almost ready?

333
00:26:01,924 --> 00:26:03,858
I wanna get there before dark.

334
00:26:03,926 --> 00:26:07,020
- We still gotta pick Logan up. Hurry, okay?
- Okay. Let me grab my jacket.

335
00:26:07,096 --> 00:26:08,723
Okay.

336
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:12,692
David.

337
00:26:14,203 --> 00:26:17,229
Nicole's curfew is 12:00,
not five after, all right?

338
00:26:17,306 --> 00:26:19,069
All right.

339
00:26:19,141 --> 00:26:22,872
Hello.

340
00:26:22,945 --> 00:26:25,004
Yeah, Eddie.

341
00:26:27,449 --> 00:26:30,816
Pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Walker. Take care.

342
00:26:30,886 --> 00:26:33,218
No, I'm finishing them up
right now.

343
00:26:33,288 --> 00:26:35,222
I'm gonna drop 'em off
at FedEx myself.

344
00:26:39,495 --> 00:26:42,328
I'm not gonna miss it. It'll get there.

345
00:26:42,398 --> 00:26:45,231
- Nicole!
- All right, Eddie. I'll see ya.

346
00:26:49,938 --> 00:26:51,929
Nicole!

347
00:26:53,242 --> 00:26:56,234
You let her leave?

348
00:26:57,846 --> 00:27:02,146
- Steven.
- Why don't you get your helpmate to do it?

349
00:27:02,217 --> 00:27:05,618
What, Eddie?

350
00:27:20,135 --> 00:27:23,468
Childhood living.

351
00:27:26,141 --> 00:27:29,406
Is easy to do.

352
00:27:32,448 --> 00:27:36,475
The things that you wanted

353
00:27:39,188 --> 00:27:41,918
I bought them for you.

354
00:27:45,994 --> 00:27:49,020
Graceless lady.

355
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,227
You know who I am.

356
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:01,871
You know I can't let you.

357
00:28:04,313 --> 00:28:08,181
Just slide through my hands.

358
00:28:10,752 --> 00:28:14,654
And wild horses.

359
00:28:16,725 --> 00:28:20,752
Couldn't drag me away.

360
00:28:23,298 --> 00:28:27,428
Wild horses.

361
00:28:29,505 --> 00:28:33,703
Couldn't drag me away.

362
00:28:39,848 --> 00:28:43,340
Faith has been broken.

363
00:28:45,587 --> 00:28:49,523
And tears must be cried.

364
00:28:51,393 --> 00:28:56,057
Let's do some living.

365
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:03,997
After we die.

366
00:29:05,674 --> 00:29:09,735
Wild horses.

367
00:29:10,913 --> 00:29:14,815
Couldn't drag me away.

368
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,583
Wild, wild horses.

369
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:28,287
Couldn't drag me away.

370
00:29:30,532 --> 00:29:35,902
Wild, wild horses.

371
00:29:35,971 --> 00:29:40,908
We'll ride them someday

372
00:29:52,487 --> 00:29:55,547
Eddie, I'm sealin' the envelope,
I'm out the door.

373
00:29:57,826 --> 00:30:01,125
What are you talkin' about?
The last pickup's not until 7:00.

374
00:30:01,196 --> 00:30:04,165
I still got half an hour. What?

375
00:30:08,237 --> 00:30:09,169
Shit!

376
00:30:13,575 --> 00:30:15,509
There you go, kid.
Take your best shot.

377
00:30:17,012 --> 00:30:19,537
Bull's-eye will get you
anything on the wall.

378
00:30:23,986 --> 00:30:26,181
- We got a winner.
- I'll take that peace pipe.

379
00:30:26,255 --> 00:30:28,780
You look like a basketball player.

380
00:30:28,857 --> 00:30:30,825
Take a shot.

381
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,452
I screwed up. I gotta
go back up to Vancouver.

382
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:41,691
Bye-bye.

383
00:30:41,766 --> 00:30:43,825
I want you to come with me.

384
00:30:45,369 --> 00:30:47,360
We could stay
in that same hotel.

385
00:30:51,242 --> 00:30:53,870
Maybe even get that same suite.

386
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,174
The number
of the hotel is by the phone.

387
00:30:58,249 --> 00:31:01,741
So just rent some videos, call Domino's,
and try not to kill each other.

388
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:04,982
- I'll try and restrain myself.
- I'll sic Kaiser on you.

389
00:31:05,056 --> 00:31:07,251
I'm shaking.

390
00:31:07,325 --> 00:31:09,418
Try and have a nice time, Nic.
Life is short.

391
00:31:09,494 --> 00:31:11,359
Nobody in the house
but you and Toby.

392
00:31:11,429 --> 00:31:13,590
- I hear you, Dad.
- Smile?

393
00:31:18,236 --> 00:31:20,636
- Hello.
- David?

394
00:31:20,705 --> 00:31:25,199
- Nicole, how are you?
- I'm good. Listen.

395
00:31:25,276 --> 00:31:28,803
David, my parents went out
of town for a couple of days,

396
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,041
and I'm all alone in my room.

397
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,784
- Nicole.
- Yes, David?

398
00:31:34,852 --> 00:31:38,515
I promised some friends I'd help
'em out with somethin' tonight.

399
00:31:38,589 --> 00:31:42,685
- Okay. Whatever.
- But, Nicole.

400
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,695
- Yeah?
- I could come by afterwards.

401
00:31:45,763 --> 00:31:47,697
- Would that be okay?
- Sure.

402
00:31:47,765 --> 00:31:49,699
If it gets too late,
I might be in bed.

403
00:31:49,767 --> 00:31:53,703
Okay? So just punch 1-4-3-2 into
the keypad and just come on in.

404
00:31:53,771 --> 00:31:55,705
I'll be waiting.

405
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:33,163
Hey.

406
00:34:17,782 --> 00:34:19,716
David.

407
00:34:33,364 --> 00:34:35,662
Nicole.

408
00:34:35,733 --> 00:34:37,667
I love you.

409
00:35:05,593 --> 00:35:08,619
Please don't tell Margo.
Not that it's a secret or anything.

410
00:35:08,696 --> 00:35:10,823
I just... I don't know, it...

411
00:35:10,898 --> 00:35:12,832
Are we talkin'
the "L" word here?

412
00:35:14,469 --> 00:35:16,403
I don't know.

413
00:35:16,471 --> 00:35:19,963
Whatever it is,
I definitely never felt it before.

414
00:35:20,041 --> 00:35:21,975
Prince Charming must be late.

415
00:35:22,043 --> 00:35:25,672
- Do you want me to wait?
- No, that's all right. He'll be here.

416
00:35:39,927 --> 00:35:43,090
David, what the hell
are you doing? Stop it!

417
00:35:46,167 --> 00:35:48,601
Stop it! Stop it!

418
00:35:52,674 --> 00:35:56,440
What? Come on.

419
00:35:56,511 --> 00:35:58,706
Go away!

420
00:36:00,048 --> 00:36:03,779
Get away from me!

421
00:36:03,851 --> 00:36:05,819
Just leave us alone.

422
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:27,938
Oh, my God. Oh, my...

423
00:36:30,211 --> 00:36:32,611
- Who is it?
- Can I come in?

424
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,171
I...

425
00:36:35,249 --> 00:36:38,150
I thought of you when I saw
this in the hotel gift shop.

426
00:36:38,219 --> 00:36:40,687
Oh, Nicole, what happened?

427
00:36:40,755 --> 00:36:45,351
I was in gym class. We were playing volleyball,
and I caught an elbow right in the eye.

428
00:36:45,426 --> 00:36:48,657
Well...

429
00:36:50,198 --> 00:36:52,325
Let's see what we can do.

430
00:36:55,403 --> 00:36:57,598
- Those are pretty shoes.
- Thank you.

431
00:36:57,672 --> 00:37:01,631
Hey there. Doesn't your daughter look
exceptionally pretty today?

432
00:37:03,778 --> 00:37:06,542
Oh, hey, yeah.
You look lovely, Nic.

433
00:37:06,614 --> 00:37:08,639
Thanks, Dad. I gotta go.

434
00:37:08,716 --> 00:37:11,617
Can I get a kiss?

435
00:37:14,689 --> 00:37:16,953
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, Nic.

436
00:37:17,024 --> 00:37:19,492
Thanks, Laura.

437
00:37:22,997 --> 00:37:25,022
- What was that about?
- Woman stuff.

438
00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:28,728
She got a black eye in gym class,
so I gave her a makeup lesson.

439
00:37:28,803 --> 00:37:30,737
So she wouldn't
look like a slut.

440
00:37:35,543 --> 00:37:37,738
Hey.

441
00:37:37,812 --> 00:37:40,474
Talk to Travis Bickle yet?

442
00:37:40,548 --> 00:37:42,641
I don't think I ever
wanna see him again.

443
00:37:46,721 --> 00:37:48,712
Are you okay?

444
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:51,315
Did you see the look in his eye?

445
00:37:51,392 --> 00:37:55,328
I can't get it out of my head.
Gave me goddamn nightmares.

446
00:37:55,396 --> 00:37:57,660
I'm sorry, Gary.

447
00:37:57,732 --> 00:37:59,757
I'm just so incredibly confused.

448
00:38:17,318 --> 00:38:19,252
Hey, I'm a murderous murder man.

449
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,618
Comin' from a bad land
Real hard-core.

450
00:38:21,689 --> 00:38:23,623
Kickin' down your front door.

451
00:38:23,691 --> 00:38:25,625
Let me get what's comin' to me.

452
00:38:25,693 --> 00:38:28,685
'Cause if I can't use my mind
I'm gonna grab the...

453
00:38:39,073 --> 00:38:41,473
We're here to see
a man about a dog.

454
00:38:41,542 --> 00:38:44,568
- Does this look like a kennel?
- I... We...

455
00:38:47,748 --> 00:38:49,682
Woof, woof, woof.

456
00:38:53,688 --> 00:38:56,782
All right, wait in here.
But don't be fooled. He's on red alert.

457
00:39:01,295 --> 00:39:03,559
They're interested in the dog.

458
00:39:03,631 --> 00:39:05,622
Go tell David
we have to leave soon.

459
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:10,399
Holy smoke, Beaver!

460
00:39:12,573 --> 00:39:15,007
Hey, man.

461
00:39:15,076 --> 00:39:17,567
What the hell
you doin' in here?

462
00:39:17,645 --> 00:39:21,843
- Not now, Knobby.
- Logan says we gotta leave soon.

463
00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:24,316
Tell Logan I'm not goin'.

464
00:39:24,385 --> 00:39:27,786
Oh, yeah? Well, he's gonna be pissed,
man. You've been bailin' a lot.

465
00:39:29,023 --> 00:39:30,957
When his old man
gets back into town,

466
00:39:31,025 --> 00:39:33,050
we're all gonna be
out on our ass.

467
00:39:33,127 --> 00:39:35,118
You better start
thinkin' about that.

468
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,814
You're welcome.

469
00:39:54,882 --> 00:39:56,816
Hey, Nicole.

470
00:39:58,553 --> 00:40:00,487
You got a fan.

471
00:40:08,329 --> 00:40:10,263
Thanks.

472
00:40:39,393 --> 00:40:41,691
Never mind.

473
00:40:53,374 --> 00:40:55,934
Steve, let me go?

474
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:05,080
Were the flowers from him?

475
00:41:05,152 --> 00:41:07,484
Yeah.

476
00:41:07,555 --> 00:41:09,648
It's just like him, you know?

477
00:41:11,058 --> 00:41:13,424
He's always so polite
and considerate.

478
00:41:13,494 --> 00:41:16,793
He never has to show off
the way other guys do.

479
00:41:16,864 --> 00:41:19,594
Then all of a sudden
he turns into a monster.

480
00:41:19,667 --> 00:41:21,931
I mean, Gary was down
on the ground, and David...

481
00:41:22,003 --> 00:41:24,904
just kept on kicking him
and kicking him so hard!

482
00:41:24,972 --> 00:41:27,270
Did he give you
the black eye too?

483
00:41:30,177 --> 00:41:32,202
Did he?

484
00:41:34,382 --> 00:41:36,316
Dad, I told you
how I got the black eye.

485
00:41:43,824 --> 00:41:46,588
Steven, why don't you
let us finish up here?

486
00:41:48,062 --> 00:41:50,257
Toss me the Kleenex?

487
00:42:01,709 --> 00:42:07,477
Nicole, I want you to understand that whatever
you think I may have done to disappoint you...

488
00:42:07,548 --> 00:42:11,450
is no reason for you
to go screw up your whole life.

489
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:13,487
What?

490
00:42:13,554 --> 00:42:15,522
Dad, I don't know what
you're talking about.

491
00:42:15,589 --> 00:42:17,523
That's what worries me.

492
00:42:18,759 --> 00:42:22,695
Look, Dad, this may come
as a big shock to you,

493
00:42:22,763 --> 00:42:25,698
but every move I make
does not have to do with you.

494
00:42:25,766 --> 00:42:28,997
- Turns out I'm living my own life.
- Not yet you're not.

495
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:31,436
As long as you're living in my house,
you'll follow my rules.

496
00:42:31,505 --> 00:42:34,906
That means when you wanna go out, I wanna
know where you're going and with who.

497
00:42:34,975 --> 00:42:37,808
- And if I don't like it, you're not going.
- Don't be ridiculous, Dad.

498
00:42:37,878 --> 00:42:41,814
- I'm not kidding, Nicole. This is gonna stop!
- What?

499
00:42:41,882 --> 00:42:44,009
Why don't you just say it?
This is all about David.

500
00:42:44,085 --> 00:42:46,349
- There's something wrong with him.
- That's your problem, not mine.

501
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,547
- He's not a good guy.
- Look, Dad.

502
00:42:48,622 --> 00:42:51,284
David and I had a disagreement.

503
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:53,553
Maybe we'll get past it,
maybe we won't.

504
00:42:55,029 --> 00:42:58,055
But no matter what happens,
it'll be between us.

505
00:43:00,267 --> 00:43:02,633
This doesn't have
anything to do with you.

506
00:43:17,118 --> 00:43:19,643
Oh, God!

507
00:43:24,558 --> 00:43:26,526
What the hell was that about?

508
00:43:29,897 --> 00:43:31,831
Oh, boy.

509
00:43:31,899 --> 00:43:34,766
He hit her too, Laura.
I know he did.

510
00:43:34,835 --> 00:43:36,666
You heard what she said.

511
00:43:36,737 --> 00:43:38,671
I don't care what anybody says.
He hit her.

512
00:43:38,739 --> 00:43:41,333
Fine.

513
00:43:41,408 --> 00:43:45,902
But don't think you can bully her into growing
up, Steven. It doesn't work that way.

514
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,861
So he hit ya.

515
00:44:08,936 --> 00:44:12,269
Sometimes that's just their asshole way
of showing they love you.

516
00:44:12,339 --> 00:44:15,103
- He didn't mean to hit me. It was an accident.
- Fine.

517
00:44:15,176 --> 00:44:19,112
- So then what's the problem?
- I don't know.

518
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:23,708
Do yourself a favor and don't think so
much. It gives you premature wrinkles.

519
00:44:23,784 --> 00:44:26,082
My dad hates him,
that's for sure.

520
00:44:26,153 --> 00:44:29,122
Well, that means that he knows
you're sleeping together.

521
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:31,488
You know, it's that usual
weirdo jealously trip.

522
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:34,221
How could he possibly know
we were sleeping together?

523
00:44:34,295 --> 00:44:38,925
Caught ya, ya ho! You never told
me you were screwin' him!

524
00:44:38,999 --> 00:44:42,025
Ach! Tch. You'll always
remember your first.

525
00:44:43,337 --> 00:44:45,897
Not your second,
not your third.

526
00:44:45,973 --> 00:44:47,736
Just your first.

527
00:44:47,808 --> 00:44:50,402
- Party!
- Oh, shit!

528
00:44:50,477 --> 00:44:52,968
No! No! Logan!

529
00:44:53,047 --> 00:44:55,515
- Don't you dare!
- Goin' in.

530
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:12,655
Nicole. Nicole.

531
00:45:12,733 --> 00:45:15,668
Just give me one minute?

532
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:25,170
I know you never
wanna see me again,

533
00:45:25,246 --> 00:45:27,646
but I still have to explain.

534
00:45:27,715 --> 00:45:30,878
There's nothin' that I can say
that'll make what I did all right.

535
00:45:30,951 --> 00:45:33,545
I know that, but I need you to know
that it came from someplace good.

536
00:45:33,621 --> 00:45:37,182
It came from me feelin' like
I'd do anything to protect you.

537
00:45:37,258 --> 00:45:39,692
- From Gary?
- I didn't know it was Gary.

538
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,958
I swear. All I saw was some guy
with his paws all over you.

539
00:45:44,031 --> 00:45:47,228
I mean, knowin' how many
bad guys are out there...

540
00:45:47,301 --> 00:45:50,532
guys that would take
advantage of somebody like you.

541
00:45:50,604 --> 00:45:53,539
Guys that I would kill if they
ever did anything to hurt you.

542
00:45:55,542 --> 00:45:57,874
I just lost it.

543
00:45:57,945 --> 00:45:59,879
I want you to know...

544
00:45:59,947 --> 00:46:04,111
that I'm very sorry about
what happened to Gary, I am.

545
00:46:04,184 --> 00:46:06,345
But I can't be sorry
that I love you.

546
00:46:08,589 --> 00:46:11,114
I learned from you,
Nicole, I really did.

547
00:46:11,191 --> 00:46:14,490
I learned that I need people
more than I thought.

548
00:46:14,561 --> 00:46:18,395
I've always been the one
takin' care of things.

549
00:46:18,465 --> 00:46:20,433
And with you, it's different.

550
00:46:21,635 --> 00:46:23,694
And I want us to
take care of each other.

551
00:46:25,673 --> 00:46:28,608
And I'll promise nothin' like that
will ever happen again.

552
00:46:34,615 --> 00:46:36,549
I'm sorry.

553
00:46:42,813 --> 00:46:44,610
I'm home.

554
00:46:50,387 --> 00:46:53,117
Laura?

555
00:47:06,203 --> 00:47:09,536
- No! No, no, no.
- Come here. Oh, yes, yes.

556
00:47:14,945 --> 00:47:18,847
Hey there! Isn't this
Indian summer great?

557
00:47:18,916 --> 00:47:21,180
- What's goin' on?
- Well, it's warm.

558
00:47:21,252 --> 00:47:23,880
We're taking advantage.
You oughta jump in.

559
00:47:23,954 --> 00:47:27,321
What's he doin' here?

560
00:47:27,391 --> 00:47:29,951
What's he doin' here, Laura?

561
00:47:31,662 --> 00:47:35,723
Steven, would you rather
she lied and snuck off to see him?

562
00:47:39,203 --> 00:47:42,866
You made the rules.

563
00:48:03,293 --> 00:48:06,228
I appreciate it.
Thank you very much.

564
00:48:09,166 --> 00:48:11,600
- Hello.
- You remember that song and dance Nicole gave us...

565
00:48:11,668 --> 00:48:14,603
about David growing up like Beaver Cleaver
in some perfect little town back East?

566
00:48:14,671 --> 00:48:16,798
- Yeah, something like that.
- Well, guess again.

567
00:48:16,873 --> 00:48:20,070
The kid bounced from foster home
to foster home to institution...

568
00:48:20,143 --> 00:48:22,873
until he was finally kicked out
on his ass at 18.

569
00:48:22,946 --> 00:48:24,880
Since then, no one knows.

570
00:48:24,948 --> 00:48:28,406
He's got no family, no address,
no work record... nothin'.

571
00:48:28,485 --> 00:48:31,283
All right. So the guy's embarrassed
about being an orphan.

572
00:48:31,355 --> 00:48:33,323
Not his fault, by the way.

573
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:37,156
So he makes up a story about having
a happy childhood to impress a girl.

574
00:48:37,227 --> 00:48:41,288
- What's the big deal?
- The big deal, Laura, is that the guy give me the creeps...

575
00:48:41,365 --> 00:48:43,424
and the girl is my daughter.

576
00:49:28,043 --> 00:49:30,705
- Hello, David.
- Hi, Mr. Walker.

577
00:49:30,779 --> 00:49:35,182
- You got a minute? I need to talk to you.
- I'm meeting Nicole.

578
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:37,218
This won't take long.

579
00:49:38,387 --> 00:49:41,322
- All right.
- Follow me around the corner.

580
00:50:00,008 --> 00:50:02,169
David, I don't want
to beat around the bush.

581
00:50:02,244 --> 00:50:04,712
I came to tell you that
you're gonna stop seeing Nicole.

582
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:09,149
Now, either you're as smart as you think
you are and you'll just go away,

583
00:50:09,218 --> 00:50:12,016
or else you're gonna make things harder
on yourself than they have to be.

584
00:50:13,288 --> 00:50:15,916
You know, Steve,
you're really not a faggot.

585
00:50:17,326 --> 00:50:20,124
- What?
- I'm serious.

586
00:50:20,195 --> 00:50:22,925
Seem like a pretty solid guy.
You should lighten up on yourself.

587
00:50:22,998 --> 00:50:26,297
- We're not talkin' about me. We're talkin' about...
- Yes, we are.

588
00:50:26,368 --> 00:50:29,531
That's what this whole thing's
about, Steve. Your inadequacies.

589
00:50:29,605 --> 00:50:31,436
- Your fears.
- You just wait a minute.

590
00:50:31,506 --> 00:50:36,443
Listen to me. See, I'm hip
to your problems. All of 'em.

591
00:50:36,511 --> 00:50:42,040
I know you abandoned Nicole when she needed you most...
'cause I licked her sweet tears.

592
00:50:42,117 --> 00:50:46,611
I know about things comin' apart at work.
Maybe you fuckin' lost it in that department.

593
00:50:48,323 --> 00:50:50,257
I also know you ain't
keepin' up, so to speak,

594
00:50:50,325 --> 00:50:52,793
your end of the bargain
with the missus.

595
00:50:52,861 --> 00:50:55,921
'Cause if you were,
she wouldn't be all over my stick.

596
00:50:55,998 --> 00:50:59,934
Relax, Steve. We're friends.

597
00:51:00,002 --> 00:51:02,129
We're practically family.

598
00:51:05,007 --> 00:51:07,771
I want you to understand
something, pal.

599
00:51:07,843 --> 00:51:10,903
If you don't disappear from my family's
life, I'm gonna rip your balls off...

600
00:51:10,979 --> 00:51:13,607
and shove 'em so far up your ass
they'll come out your fuckin' mouth!

601
00:51:13,682 --> 00:51:16,276
You got that, my friend?

602
00:51:39,007 --> 00:51:40,975
Steve, what I'm saying is,

603
00:51:41,043 --> 00:51:44,604
even if he's got a record and we can convince
a judge, this thing could still backfire.

604
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:48,116
You tell some kid that the state is restraining
him, you'll make him want it more.

605
00:51:48,183 --> 00:51:50,811
We've gotta do something.
I'm not gonna just sit around.

606
00:51:50,886 --> 00:51:53,150
Let me ask you something
as your friend.

607
00:51:53,221 --> 00:51:56,486
Are you sure you're not just
fighting the inevitable here?

608
00:51:56,558 --> 00:51:59,493
You didn't expect she
was gonna stay a virgin, did you?

609
00:51:59,561 --> 00:52:02,428
Alex, the guy is a psychopath.

610
00:52:02,497 --> 00:52:04,431
Because he's hot
for your daughter?

611
00:52:04,499 --> 00:52:06,967
Took a jealous swing at some guy,
talked trash to you?

612
00:52:07,035 --> 00:52:10,801
- Are you gonna help me or not?
- Yeah, of course.

613
00:52:10,872 --> 00:52:12,806
I'll make a couple of calls
for you, all right?

614
00:52:15,344 --> 00:52:17,869
- Where's my father?
- He's in his workroom.

615
00:52:22,117 --> 00:52:26,053
You know, Dad, I never expect you
to be perfect, 'cause I know I'm not.

616
00:52:26,121 --> 00:52:28,316
But I never thought
you were a hypocrite until now.

617
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:30,551
Honey, calm down.
What are you talking about?

618
00:52:30,625 --> 00:52:33,253
I'm talking about you lecturing me
about what David did to Gary,

619
00:52:33,328 --> 00:52:36,388
and then turning around and acting
a million times worse yourself.

620
00:52:36,465 --> 00:52:40,401
- I don't know what he told you...
- He didn't have to tell me anything. I saw the bruises.

621
00:52:40,469 --> 00:52:44,166
- What bruises?
- You're gonna tell me that you never touched him,

622
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:47,208
that you didn't hit him so hard in
the chest that he's sore and bruised?

623
00:52:47,275 --> 00:52:50,369
- Look, I-I may have...
- Yeah, exactly, Dad.

624
00:52:50,445 --> 00:52:53,972
You may have. But I'll tell you
what you definitely did.

625
00:52:54,049 --> 00:52:57,075
You lost my respect.

626
00:52:57,152 --> 00:52:58,915
Nicole, come back here!

627
00:53:01,289 --> 00:53:03,382
Nicole!

628
00:53:08,797 --> 00:53:11,527
Nicole!

629
00:53:18,073 --> 00:53:20,371
Fuck!

630
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:42,126
She ran to the car, she got in, and she slammed
the door in my face, if you need to know.

631
00:53:43,999 --> 00:53:46,627
What?

632
00:53:46,701 --> 00:53:49,135
What are you talkin' about?
She's only 16.

633
00:53:50,906 --> 00:53:54,398
So what if she wasn't kidnapped?
I still have the right to...

634
00:53:56,912 --> 00:53:58,846
Fine, I'll call a lawyer!

635
00:54:00,182 --> 00:54:03,640
Just you and me, Nicole.
Nobody else.

636
00:54:03,718 --> 00:54:06,118
Nobody else.

637
00:54:08,256 --> 00:54:10,451
- Do you want me?
- Yes.

638
00:54:12,327 --> 00:54:14,261
Tell me.

639
00:54:14,329 --> 00:54:16,490
Tell me you want me.

640
00:54:20,435 --> 00:54:23,768
- I want you, David.
- Yeah?

641
00:54:27,309 --> 00:54:29,277
- David.
- Yeah?

642
00:54:30,345 --> 00:54:32,279
I love you.

643
00:54:35,417 --> 00:54:39,410
And wild horses.

644
00:54:41,089 --> 00:54:45,583
Couldn't drag me away.

645
00:54:47,896 --> 00:54:51,229
- And wild horses.
- Sure you won't change your mind and come home with me?

646
00:54:51,299 --> 00:54:55,292
I can't. My dad will kill me.

647
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:58,305
Okay. I love you.

648
00:54:59,641 --> 00:55:01,905
- Bye.
- Bye.

649
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:35,305
I woke up wanting you.

650
00:55:35,377 --> 00:55:38,437
But you are rarely there

651
00:55:40,015 --> 00:55:44,543
I howl a song
and I prowl at dawn

652
00:55:44,619 --> 00:55:47,554
I growl but you don't care.

653
00:55:49,391 --> 00:55:50,915
Growl

654
00:55:53,094 --> 00:55:57,588
I see you walking
around like that.

655
00:55:57,666 --> 00:56:01,067
With that animal on your back

656
00:56:07,442 --> 00:56:11,811
I woke up wanting you.

657
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:16,544
- But you are rarely there.
- Get outta here, you skinny-ass motherfucker!

658
00:56:16,618 --> 00:56:20,952
I howl a song
and I prowl at dawn

659
00:56:21,022 --> 00:56:23,957
I growl but you don't care.

660
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:28,260
Growl.

661
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:32,596
- Come on.
- Hey, fuck you. She's mine.

662
00:56:35,003 --> 00:56:37,062
You want me?

663
00:56:41,209 --> 00:56:43,143
Say it so he can hear you.

664
00:56:43,211 --> 00:56:45,202
Go ahead. Tell him.

665
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,273
Tell him you want me.
Tell him! Now!

666
00:56:49,351 --> 00:56:52,149
I want him!

667
00:56:59,828 --> 00:57:03,992
Yeah, fuck it. Keep that
dirty little bitch. I don't want her.

668
00:58:19,799 --> 00:58:21,733
What?

669
00:58:40,119 --> 00:58:45,216
- Nic.
- Please, Dad. I don't wanna talk about it.

670
00:58:49,696 --> 00:58:51,994
I just wanna be alone.

671
00:58:57,370 --> 00:58:59,429
Okay.

672
00:59:05,945 --> 00:59:10,905
The pain'll go away, honey.
I promise.

673
00:59:18,524 --> 00:59:21,254
Is she okay?

674
00:59:21,327 --> 00:59:23,557
I hope so.

675
00:59:33,172 --> 00:59:37,939
I got you some anyway. I thought food
might zap you out of your zombie trip.

676
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:41,571
- Thanks. I'm just not hungry.
- Let me guess.

677
00:59:41,647 --> 00:59:45,105
You're preparing a junk food defense before
you and your boyfriend go on a killing spree.

678
00:59:45,184 --> 00:59:46,879
No. Definitely not.

679
00:59:46,953 --> 00:59:49,615
Joke. Joke, Nicole.

680
00:59:49,689 --> 00:59:53,090
As in "ha-ha." Remember?

681
00:59:53,159 --> 00:59:56,151
Jesus, cane me in Singapore.

682
00:59:56,229 --> 01:00:00,928
- Was Margo in bio?
- She called and said she was sick.

683
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,491
- At least she's honest.
- What?

684
01:00:03,569 --> 01:00:07,630
- Nothing.
- Speak of the devil.

685
01:00:09,008 --> 01:00:11,476
- Guess who?
- Don't touch me!

686
01:00:11,544 --> 01:00:13,478
Nicole, where are you going?

687
01:00:13,546 --> 01:00:16,071
- Get away from me! Help!
- Get over here. Stop it!

688
01:00:16,149 --> 01:00:18,174
- Somebody help me!
- What's the matter with you? Come here.

689
01:00:18,251 --> 01:00:20,344
- Hey!
- Just stay away from me!

690
01:00:20,419 --> 01:00:23,855
- No. Why?
- You heard her David. Just let her go!

691
01:00:23,923 --> 01:00:28,860
All right? Okay?

692
01:00:31,364 --> 01:00:33,832
All right.

693
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:35,834
Okay.

694
01:00:50,016 --> 01:00:52,348
- Hey. They're in there.
- Hi. Thanks.

695
01:00:56,622 --> 01:00:58,852
Why won't you take my calls?

696
01:00:58,925 --> 01:01:03,021
As you can see, I'm playing
with my little brother.

697
01:01:03,095 --> 01:01:07,293
Okay. You don't have to
be so snotty about it.

698
01:01:07,366 --> 01:01:10,927
Hey there, handsome. When you
gonna grow up so I can ravage you?

699
01:01:11,003 --> 01:01:14,268
Margo, why don't you
leave Toby alone?

700
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:17,503
Jesus. What's your problem?

701
01:01:29,055 --> 01:01:32,513
What?

702
01:01:32,592 --> 01:01:36,926
The fact that you can stand there and act
cool and fine as if nothing ever happened.

703
01:01:36,996 --> 01:01:42,229
That's what scares me
the most about you, Margo.

704
01:01:42,301 --> 01:01:47,568
It's like I don't know you, or... Maybe
I don't know anybody for that matter.

705
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:50,438
- Everybody says one thing and then does another.
- Nicole.

706
01:01:50,509 --> 01:01:54,878
I... I'm sorry. I just... I have no idea
what you're talking about.

707
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:59,784
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

708
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:11,129
Who told you?
Did David tell you?

709
01:02:11,197 --> 01:02:14,564
Forget it. It doesn't matter.
You're not a friend of mine.

710
01:02:14,634 --> 01:02:19,401
Nicole, I was high, okay?
He forced me. He made me do it!

711
01:02:19,472 --> 01:02:23,806
Nicole, please don't do this.
Please don't do this. I need you.

712
01:02:23,876 --> 01:02:27,403
You're my only friend!

713
01:03:26,476 --> 01:03:29,104
Hey, pull over!
I gotta talk to you!

714
01:04:16,125 --> 01:04:19,458
- What the fuck do ya think you're doin'?
- David, please leave me alone.

715
01:04:19,529 --> 01:04:22,555
- What did you say to Nicole?
- Nothing.

716
01:04:22,632 --> 01:04:26,432
You fuckin', lyin' fuckin' whore.

717
01:04:26,502 --> 01:04:29,801
Get the fuck outta the car!
You lyin' fuckin' whore!

718
01:04:32,909 --> 01:04:36,072
What did you say to her?
What the fuck did you say to her?

719
01:04:36,145 --> 01:04:40,582
Nothing. I swear, David. I didn't tell
her. I don't know how she knows.

720
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:42,675
But she knows.

721
01:04:45,121 --> 01:04:49,854
Let me tell you somethin'. You better
fix it. You better make it right.

722
01:04:49,926 --> 01:04:53,657
Because if you don't,
I'm gonna hurt you.

723
01:04:53,729 --> 01:04:56,823
Don't cry.

724
01:04:56,899 --> 01:04:59,060
You fuckin' liked it.

725
01:05:08,744 --> 01:05:14,444
Mr. Walker, sir, I believe I owe you,
Nicole and your entire family an apology.

726
01:05:14,517 --> 01:05:16,883
Well, I was wonderin' if...

727
01:05:16,953 --> 01:05:22,152
I was just wonderin' if you'd be so kind as
to let me come in and explain a few things?

728
01:05:22,225 --> 01:05:24,420
I think you might understand.

729
01:05:26,028 --> 01:05:29,191
I'm not interested
in understanding you, David.

730
01:05:29,265 --> 01:05:32,792
I'm only interested in
keeping you away from Nicole.

731
01:05:32,869 --> 01:05:36,361
And I'll do whatever it takes
to accomplish that. Okay?

732
01:05:37,974 --> 01:05:40,602
Whatever it takes.

733
01:05:58,394 --> 01:06:00,328
Thanks, Dad.

734
01:06:00,396 --> 01:06:04,696
Hello?

735
01:06:04,767 --> 01:06:08,396
Oh, hey, Eddie.
Just hold on one second.

736
01:06:08,471 --> 01:06:10,803
Yeah, Eddie?

737
01:06:10,873 --> 01:06:14,639
I'm gonna work all night.

738
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:16,644
Please, don't panic.

739
01:07:01,591 --> 01:07:04,719
I talked to the school.
Security knows about everything, so...

740
01:07:04,794 --> 01:07:08,195
Don't worry, Dad.
It's over, okay?

741
01:07:08,264 --> 01:07:10,198
- Love you.
- Love you.

742
01:07:19,342 --> 01:07:22,277
Nicole! Wait up.

743
01:07:22,345 --> 01:07:25,371
- Hi.
- Everything copacetic?

744
01:07:25,448 --> 01:07:29,077
Yeah. You know, I never thanked you
for the other day.

745
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:31,085
No sweat.

746
01:07:43,165 --> 01:07:46,191
Yes! You did it! This is great.

747
01:07:46,269 --> 01:07:48,863
This is a work of art.

748
01:07:48,938 --> 01:07:52,101
You think you can stay conscious long
enough to crunch out the new numbers?

749
01:07:52,174 --> 01:07:55,060
I've been livin' on pure adrenalin
for 24 hours. Why stop now?

750
01:07:55,193 --> 01:07:57,525
Sure you don't want
to come to the mall?

751
01:07:57,596 --> 01:07:59,894
Nah. I gotta finish
that story for the paper.

752
01:07:59,965 --> 01:08:04,493
The Washington Post is gonna need to see
something before they make me editor.

753
01:08:04,569 --> 01:08:07,299
- Hey, Laura. - Hey, Gary.
- Get in the back.

754
01:08:07,372 --> 01:08:09,340
- Hey, Toby bear.
- Hi, Gary.

755
01:08:09,407 --> 01:08:11,341
Okay, I'll see you later.

756
01:08:34,599 --> 01:08:37,193
- Hey, Gary.
- David.

757
01:08:37,269 --> 01:08:41,205
- Did you know I grew up in a lot of different places?
- No. Actually, Nicole told...

758
01:08:41,273 --> 01:08:44,436
Oh, yeah. Bridgewater,
Spaford, Rikers, you name it.

759
01:08:44,509 --> 01:08:46,272
- You know what they have in common?
- No.

760
01:08:46,344 --> 01:08:49,802
Weak walls. Actually, that's why
they moved me around so much.

761
01:08:49,881 --> 01:08:51,815
I'd pound on the wall,
it'd break.

762
01:08:51,883 --> 01:08:53,942
They'd move me to the next one
and the next one...

763
01:08:54,019 --> 01:08:57,580
until finally they got sick of
buildin' walls and showed me the door.

764
01:08:57,656 --> 01:09:01,592
Pretty useful upbringing it turned out,
though, Gar. There's always walls.

765
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:07,428
Usually the moist, fleshy kind that try to get
in the way of me and it, whatever it may be.

766
01:09:07,499 --> 01:09:12,562
Silly, silly people, though.
They're only to be knocked down.

767
01:09:12,637 --> 01:09:14,662
Gary.

768
01:09:36,361 --> 01:09:38,989
- We ready?
- We're ready?

769
01:09:39,064 --> 01:09:42,761
I appreciate your efforts. I know how hard the
push has been on yourselves and your families.

770
01:09:42,834 --> 01:09:47,294
Today is just another dog and pony show.
I'll kick it off, and then you're up, Steve.

771
01:09:47,372 --> 01:09:49,966
Let's sell these guys.

772
01:09:50,041 --> 01:09:52,532
How many tickets we got
for the Hawks Sunday?

773
01:09:52,611 --> 01:09:56,513
- We got the four. Peterman kept the rest.
- That figures.

774
01:10:00,952 --> 01:10:03,318
Holy shit!

775
01:10:06,458 --> 01:10:08,392
Jesus, Steve.

776
01:10:14,699 --> 01:10:17,691
What does it say?

777
01:10:17,769 --> 01:10:23,139
Eddie, I need for you to give me the keys to your
car and for you to catch a ride with Harvey.

778
01:10:23,208 --> 01:10:26,006
- Steve, we gotta...
- Please!

779
01:10:27,946 --> 01:10:31,006
Okay.

780
01:10:54,806 --> 01:10:59,675
Hello, Laura? Nicole?
Come on. Somebody pick up.

781
01:10:59,744 --> 01:11:04,181
Shit!

782
01:11:04,249 --> 01:11:08,310
Hello, Margo. This is Mr. Walker.
Is Nicole with you?

783
01:11:09,888 --> 01:11:12,379
Do you know where
David McCall lives?

784
01:11:38,149 --> 01:11:41,585
How are you?
I need to talk to you.

785
01:11:41,653 --> 01:11:44,417
Help!

786
01:11:44,489 --> 01:11:49,950
You gotta listen to me, Nicole.
To me. The real me.

787
01:11:50,028 --> 01:11:54,055
You gotta use the one thing
you have that can hear the real me.

788
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:58,836
It's not here.
It's not what I say.

789
01:11:58,903 --> 01:12:01,394
It's not here.

790
01:12:01,473 --> 01:12:04,271
It's not the way
you see me acting.

791
01:12:04,342 --> 01:12:07,004
It's here.

792
01:12:07,078 --> 01:12:10,912
That's what it is, Nicole. You know it.

793
01:12:10,982 --> 01:12:15,248
I know it. Your daddy knows it.
Everybody knows it.

794
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:19,723
That's why they're tryin' to keep
us apart. They're just jealous.

795
01:12:19,791 --> 01:12:24,387
We have somethin' that
everybody wants but nobody has.

796
01:12:24,462 --> 01:12:27,989
We can't let them
take that away from us, Nicole.

797
01:12:28,066 --> 01:12:31,832
It belongs to me and you. Okay?

798
01:12:35,273 --> 01:12:38,470
I love you. I love you.

799
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:44,441
Help!

800
01:12:44,516 --> 01:12:46,711
Somebody help me.

801
01:15:01,374 --> 01:15:04,537
It's your fucking fault!

802
01:15:04,611 --> 01:15:08,479
Come on! Now somebody knows
who did this. Now who is it?

803
01:15:08,548 --> 01:15:13,144
- I know who did it.
- Well, I'll fucking kill whoever did this!

804
01:15:13,220 --> 01:15:15,950
- Yeah, who?
- Yeah, let's pay the dude a fuckin' visit, then!

805
01:15:16,022 --> 01:15:17,956
All right.

806
01:15:24,798 --> 01:15:26,959
Here.

807
01:15:28,668 --> 01:15:31,296
Thanks.

808
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:38,841
I can't get over the feeling that I let you down, Nic.
I should've seen it coming.

809
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:44,275
- I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault, Laura.

810
01:15:47,454 --> 01:15:49,945
Thanks, anyway.

811
01:15:50,023 --> 01:15:53,652
I mean that, on top of the fact that
he assaulted her in a public bathroom,

812
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:57,390
and you're tellin' me that that's
not enough to haul him in?

813
01:15:57,464 --> 01:16:01,161
Who gives a shit
about warrants?

814
01:16:01,234 --> 01:16:06,536
They're runnin' their own cartel, and
you can't do a goddamn thing about it?

815
01:16:06,606 --> 01:16:10,303
Well, look, I'm not worried about tonight,
but what about tomorrow and the next day?

816
01:16:10,377 --> 01:16:12,675
She can't stay here
like she's a prisoner.

817
01:16:22,689 --> 01:16:24,748
Pull in over there.

818
01:16:26,259 --> 01:16:28,318
We'll cut through the woods.

819
01:16:39,506 --> 01:16:43,203
- An eye for an eye.
- A tooth for a fuckin' tooth!

820
01:16:43,276 --> 01:16:46,609
Just remember,
Nicole ain't part of this game.

821
01:17:07,834 --> 01:17:09,961
Margo.

822
01:17:12,038 --> 01:17:14,768
What's wrong?

823
01:17:16,176 --> 01:17:18,167
We...

824
01:17:22,782 --> 01:17:24,807
Gary's dead.

825
01:17:24,885 --> 01:17:30,393
They found his body in the woods
by school, beaten to death.

826
01:17:33,095 --> 01:17:36,496
Kaiser. Kaiser.

827
01:17:36,566 --> 01:17:38,898
Come here, boy.
Come here, Kaiser.

828
01:17:38,968 --> 01:17:41,664
Come here, boy.

829
01:17:41,737 --> 01:17:45,901
Come here, boy. Good boy.

830
01:17:45,975 --> 01:17:48,603
Okay, fine. You're right.
It's not an emergency.

831
01:17:48,678 --> 01:17:52,341
Could I please talk to the people
that try and solve murders?

832
01:17:52,415 --> 01:17:55,475
Jesus!

833
01:17:55,551 --> 01:17:59,112
Come on. That's a good boy.

834
01:18:05,294 --> 01:18:07,785
- Come here, Toby.
- Yeah, yeah...

835
01:18:07,864 --> 01:18:11,356
- Come here.
- My... My name is Steven... Hello?

836
01:18:11,434 --> 01:18:14,028
Hello? Hello?

837
01:18:14,103 --> 01:18:17,266
- The phone is dead.
- You're next, man!

838
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:20,707
No!

839
01:18:20,776 --> 01:18:24,234
You don't know what's out there.
Here. Security'll come.

840
01:18:26,749 --> 01:18:31,482
- There's no siren.
- Well, they'll still get the signal. Larry'll come.

841
01:18:31,554 --> 01:18:35,115
No, it's disconnected. The system
works through the phone lines.

842
01:18:35,191 --> 01:18:38,160
- Come here.
- It doesn't matter. No one is getting in here.

843
01:18:38,227 --> 01:18:42,789
- You designed it, remember? Reinforced doors. No entry without the code.
- Dad?

844
01:18:42,865 --> 01:18:45,925
David's got the code.

845
01:18:59,015 --> 01:19:01,745
It all could've been different,
Mr. Walker.

846
01:19:01,817 --> 01:19:05,253
You should've allowed nature
to take its course.

847
01:19:05,321 --> 01:19:09,121
In the end it will anyway.

848
01:19:09,191 --> 01:19:11,921
So let me in the fuckin' house!

849
01:19:22,705 --> 01:19:26,004
- Nicole, take Margo and Toby up to your room and stay there.
- Okay.

850
01:19:26,075 --> 01:19:30,273
Laura, get the flashlight. Then
turn off every light in the house!

851
01:19:36,185 --> 01:19:38,881
Go, Nicole! And lock your door!

852
01:19:54,070 --> 01:19:57,767
Turn the flashlight off. I don't want
'em to know where anybody is.

853
01:20:00,176 --> 01:20:04,237
No one's gonna hurt
our family, honey. No one!

854
01:20:48,958 --> 01:20:51,518
An eye for an eye,
Mr. Walker, sir?

855
01:20:51,594 --> 01:20:54,859
You fuck up my house,
I'll fuck up yours!

856
01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:56,955
Steven?

857
01:21:00,870 --> 01:21:02,804
Come on. The refrigerator.

858
01:21:11,347 --> 01:21:14,441
They're gonna kill us,
just like they did Gary.

859
01:21:16,118 --> 01:21:18,951
Don't say that.
You need to calm down.

860
01:21:19,021 --> 01:21:22,218
- I can't. I can't. I can't.
- You need to.

861
01:21:22,291 --> 01:21:26,284
- Nicole.
- Noo-oo-oo!

862
01:21:26,362 --> 01:21:29,126
Get out of the way!

863
01:21:33,502 --> 01:21:36,232
Go check the kids. Go on.

864
01:21:38,541 --> 01:21:40,475
Nicole, are you all right?

865
01:21:40,543 --> 01:21:42,602
We're okay!

866
01:21:42,678 --> 01:21:44,509
Steve!

867
01:22:02,064 --> 01:22:05,261
You gotta do ol' dad
a favor before he kills you.

868
01:22:28,023 --> 01:22:31,288
We're sorry. You've reached a number
that has been disconnected...

869
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:33,920
or is no longer in service.

870
01:22:46,942 --> 01:22:48,876
- Steve!
- Laura!

871
01:23:10,699 --> 01:23:13,395
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

872
01:23:15,738 --> 01:23:18,502
I gotta get to a hospital, man.
I'm fucked!

873
01:23:18,574 --> 01:23:21,168
- I'm fucked!
- This gig's tired.

874
01:23:21,243 --> 01:23:23,211
Car comin', Logan.
Let's get outta here.

875
01:23:23,279 --> 01:23:26,180
- Logan, you comin'?
- It's Larry.

876
01:23:26,248 --> 01:23:28,978
- Gimme the fuckin' gun.
- It's gonna be all right.

877
01:23:29,051 --> 01:23:31,212
Thank you, God. Thank you.

878
01:23:31,287 --> 01:23:34,723
- Stay here.
- Be careful, Steven.

879
01:23:54,610 --> 01:23:56,703
Hands in the air, son.

880
01:23:56,779 --> 01:24:00,112
- Sir, is there somethin' wrong?
- Hands on the hood real slow.

881
01:24:00,182 --> 01:24:05,051
Sir, I think there's some confusion. I just
came back from visiting my girlfriend.

882
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:07,554
Is that right?

883
01:24:09,959 --> 01:24:12,427
- Stay where you are!
- Larry!

884
01:24:12,494 --> 01:24:16,021
- Mr. Walker, you okay?
- We're all right. We're safe.

885
01:24:16,098 --> 01:24:19,329
- You know these jokers? Are there any more of them?
- I think the others ran away.

886
01:24:42,491 --> 01:24:47,258
There's plenty of time. We're gonna take this inside.
Get the cuffs and the guns.

887
01:25:03,379 --> 01:25:07,008
Laura, stay back!
Don't open the door.

888
01:25:07,082 --> 01:25:10,051
- What? Steven, what's going on?
- Mrs. Walker?

889
01:25:10,119 --> 01:25:14,180
Ma'am, we'd like you to see the situation
from a different point of view.

890
01:25:15,257 --> 01:25:17,725
- Oh, God!
- Laura, no!

891
01:25:17,793 --> 01:25:22,526
Yo, lady of the house, we're comin' in. You
gotta decide if he's comin' with us, and fast.

892
01:25:22,598 --> 01:25:25,965
Say bye-bye.

893
01:25:31,707 --> 01:25:33,641
Laura.

894
01:25:48,557 --> 01:25:50,616
Laura, no!

895
01:25:50,693 --> 01:25:54,026
I'm sorry.

896
01:25:54,096 --> 01:25:56,030
I'm sorry.

897
01:25:57,333 --> 01:26:00,427
Terry, go out there
and keep a watch.

898
01:26:00,502 --> 01:26:04,461
If I could get to Laura's car phone...

899
01:26:06,108 --> 01:26:09,566
I can fit through my bathroom window.

900
01:26:22,658 --> 01:26:24,592
Log, cuff her.

901
01:26:30,899 --> 01:26:33,629
Steven!

902
01:26:33,702 --> 01:26:36,569
Logan, go find some tape.

903
01:26:57,829 --> 01:27:01,925
I think I'll go check out
the rest of the house.

904
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,730
If you touch any
of those kids...

905
01:27:04,803 --> 01:27:09,297
Calm down, Mr. Walker.
Everything's under control.

906
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:28,122
Stay away from me.
Stay away from me!

907
01:27:30,762 --> 01:27:34,596
- Let go of me!
- Noo-oo-oo!

908
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:38,067
- Leave her alone! Don't you hurt her!
- Jealous bitch!

909
01:27:38,136 --> 01:27:40,502
- No! No!
- Come on!

910
01:27:44,209 --> 01:27:48,077
- Stop!
- No, get off me! No!

911
01:27:48,146 --> 01:27:51,274
Stop hitting her, you mother...

912
01:28:04,396 --> 01:28:06,364
Toby!

913
01:28:27,745 --> 01:28:31,408
Come on, Mr. Walker.

914
01:28:31,482 --> 01:28:34,417
Time to give away the bride.

915
01:29:02,847 --> 01:29:05,372
No! No!

916
01:29:12,857 --> 01:29:15,155
It's time to go, Nicole.

917
01:29:15,226 --> 01:29:20,220
First, I want you to do the
right thing and say bye to Daddy.

918
01:29:25,303 --> 01:29:28,136
- No!
- What?

919
01:29:28,206 --> 01:29:31,505
You wanna go with me,
don't you?

920
01:29:35,279 --> 01:29:37,213
- Yes.
- Well, all right then.

921
01:29:37,281 --> 01:29:42,344
Come here and give your father a kiss good-bye.
It's not easy to give away your daughter.

922
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:44,388
David! Don't!

923
01:29:46,824 --> 01:29:49,315
Please!

924
01:29:49,393 --> 01:29:52,988
Nicole.

925
01:29:54,332 --> 01:29:56,493
I know this is hard.

926
01:29:56,567 --> 01:29:59,832
I'm sorry it has to be
like this, but it does.

927
01:29:59,904 --> 01:30:02,031
It's not our fault.

928
01:30:02,106 --> 01:30:05,337
It's his.
I tried so hard to be nice,

929
01:30:05,409 --> 01:30:08,674
to get him to accept me.

930
01:30:08,746 --> 01:30:12,580
Can't you see all he wants is for you
to be his little girl forever?

931
01:30:12,650 --> 01:30:15,175
You don't want that, do you?

932
01:30:19,290 --> 01:30:23,420
It's okay.

933
01:30:23,494 --> 01:30:27,328
All girls cry at their weddings.
Now, I know this is gonna be hard.

934
01:30:27,398 --> 01:30:31,698
We'll get over it... together.

935
01:30:33,671 --> 01:30:36,469
Just me and you.
Nobody else, remember?

936
01:30:39,577 --> 01:30:41,545
Daddy.

937
01:30:44,515 --> 01:30:47,882
You will forever hold your peace!

938
01:31:07,371 --> 01:31:10,306
Now, you get out of here!

938
01:31:11,305 --> 01:31:17,184
