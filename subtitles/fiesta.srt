MAN:
Maestro...

165
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:06,592
...would you like to select the bulls
for shipment to MeXico City?

166
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:09,602
Yes. Of course.

167
00:13:14,109 --> 00:13:16,907
The bull is a little tired, huh?

Mario?

- I can't.
- Why not?

171
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,268
- Mother is out there.
- No, she isn't.

172

I just came through.

00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:28,744
All right.

Mario.

Is that your lesson?

00:14:46,068 --> 00:14:47,592
No, Mother. I'm sorry.

177
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:50,830
- What is it, then?
MARIA: It's entirely his own invention.

178
00:14:51,006 --> 00:14:54,942
It comes into his ears in the field.
It comes out of his fingers on the piano.

179
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:59,069
It's as beautiful as a hundred butterflies.

Somebody has taken it.

- What?
- My music, the rhapsody, gone.

That's impossible, dear.

Well, then, where is it?

- I never kept it anywhere but here.

Do you know when you had it last?

Last Sunday, when Pepe was down
to see Maria.

195

She insisted that I play it for him.
All of it.

- Is it very beautiful, Father?
- Magnificent.

Uh, Father, Maria means the party dress
for her birthday.

211
00:17:13,015 --> 00:17:16,382
Oh, that's all right, Mario.
The younger always comes first.

212
00:17:16,552 --> 00:17:18,611
Younger? You are twins.

213

I'm older by 15 minutes.

214

- Fifteen minutes.

00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:24,652
...did you or did you not get the dress?
- Yes.

216
00:17:24,827 --> 00:17:26,920
Of course.

217
00:17:27,096 --> 00:17:28,996
It's a good moment
for your career, Mario.

218
00:17:29,164 --> 00:17:33,658
You see, your measurements are eXactly
as mine were when I was your age.

219

We'll show them something tomorrow.

in this eXhibition tomorrow.

223
00:17:43,545 --> 00:17:46,981
Of course. How else will Barrios know
he's good enough for MeXico City?

224
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,709
- Barrios?
- Is he really coming to see me fight?

225
00:17:49,885 --> 00:17:51,648
- Certainly.
- Tomorrow's his birthday.

226
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,754
Now, Mother, don't worry.

227
00:17:53,922 --> 00:17:57,119
Morales men,
they know how to handle bulls.

228
00:17:57,292 --> 00:17:58,691
Have you picked your bull yet?

229
00:17:59,294 --> 00:18:01,023
I was just about to leave when...

230
00:18:03,365 --> 00:18:05,026
We're going now.

231
00:18:05,634 --> 00:18:07,499
Are you ready, Maria?

232
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,830
I'll get my hat.

233
00:18:10,072 --> 00:18:12,040
MARIO:
I'll be waiting.

234
00:18:16,712 --> 00:18:19,704
That's quite a boy I've got there.

235
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:24,842
I wonder if you've ever forgiven me
for the fact that your first child was a girl.

236
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,989
Well, it was a shock.

237
00:18:28,323 --> 00:18:30,018
But you made everything all right.

238
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,217
And immediately. Ha, ha.

239
00:18:32,728 --> 00:18:34,889
You always make everything all right.

MARIA:
Mario, no, no! Please, Mario, no!

241
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,461
Tell me, where is my music? Where is it?

242
00:18:40,636 --> 00:18:41,933
- I'll tell you.
- You promise?

243
00:18:42,104 --> 00:18:44,004
- Yes, I promise.
- All right, where is it?

250
00:19:24,213 --> 00:19:26,807
Miguel, what are you trying to do
to that bull?

251
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,551
What is the bull trying to do to Miguel?

252
00:19:29,718 --> 00:19:33,313
- Ha, ha. I like that one.
- You do? That's good enough for me.

253
00:19:33,488 --> 00:19:36,252
Maria's right. With him,
you'll put on a good show tomorrow.

254
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,017
He'll charge straight, you'll see.

255
00:19:38,193 --> 00:19:42,960
He's got strong legs, good shoulders,
and his eyes are on fire. That's a true bull.

256
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:45,827
Isn't it wonderful
how much Chato knows about a bull?

257
00:19:46,001 --> 00:19:47,798
How do you account for it, Maria?

258
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,232
Well, that's simple, Mario.

259
00:19:49,404 --> 00:19:51,269
All you have to do is think like a bull.

260
00:19:54,009 --> 00:19:55,806
Well, I'll see you later, Chato.

261
00:19:56,378 --> 00:19:58,938
- You'll be over later, Maria?
- Yes.

262
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,508
(MARIO WHISTLES)

263
00:20:33,682 --> 00:20:35,843
I'll be right back, Papa.

264
00:20:44,693 --> 00:20:46,251
Now, suppose you tell me:

265
00:20:46,428 --> 00:20:48,157
- Where have you been?
- Out of my mind.

266
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,696
Now you tell me:
Which way does the world go round?

267
00:20:50,866 --> 00:20:52,060
This way or that way?

268
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:54,293
- Why?
- You're wrong. Today, it goes this way.

269
00:20:54,469 --> 00:20:57,927
- And this way. And this way. Ha, ha.
- Oh, please, Mario.

270
00:20:58,206 --> 00:20:59,264
Now will you tell me?

271
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:01,409
When Pepe gets here,
we'll know everything.

272
00:21:01,576 --> 00:21:03,476
And who did it? Who thought of it?

273
00:21:03,645 --> 00:21:05,169
Maria. I'm telling you, she's...

274
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:08,714
- Oh, Mario, you're not telling me anything.
- Oh, she's so smart.

275
00:21:08,884 --> 00:21:10,476
If it weren't for her, l...

276
00:21:10,652 --> 00:21:13,519
Conchita, if I ever amount to anything
in this world...

277
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,919
...you know who'll be responsible.
- Maria.

278
00:21:16,091 --> 00:21:17,581
Oh, Conchita, I'm not...

279
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:19,852
I know, darling, she's your twin.

280
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,120
But what happened?

281
00:21:21,296 --> 00:21:24,754
Well, l... My music manuscripts disappeared.
Now, wait a minute.

282
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:26,195
I looked all over for them.

283
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,563
And when I was about to go crazy...

284
00:21:28,737 --> 00:21:32,764
...I suddenly see Maria
smiling like a porcelain cat.

285
00:21:33,108 --> 00:21:34,905
Do you know who has the music now?

286
00:21:35,077 --> 00:21:36,510
No.

287
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,513
- MaXimino Contreras.
- The symphony conductor.

288
00:21:39,681 --> 00:21:41,308
- That's right.
- Oh, Mario.

289
00:21:41,483 --> 00:21:45,510
I wouldn't have the nerve to send my music
to a man like that. I couldn't.

290
00:21:45,687 --> 00:21:49,817
But Maria, well, she just gave it to Pepe,
who's a friend of Contreras...

291
00:21:49,992 --> 00:21:52,927
...and forced Pepe
to make Contreras play it.

292
00:21:53,095 --> 00:21:56,087
- And I am scared to death.
- Oh, but it's good, Mario.

293
00:21:56,264 --> 00:21:57,424
It's beautiful.

294
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:58,964
He's sure to like it.

295
00:21:59,134 --> 00:22:01,898
Oh, I don't know. I can't believe it.

296
00:22:03,472 --> 00:22:05,838
But if he does like it...

297
00:22:06,008 --> 00:22:08,238
I mean, if Maria is right...

298
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,170
Conchita...

299
00:22:11,346 --> 00:22:13,075
...you know that's what I live for.

300
00:22:14,816 --> 00:22:17,910
That and this.

301
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:24,949
It's wrong. All wrong.

302
00:22:25,127 --> 00:22:28,528
- Have you done something wrong again?
- No, I didn't.

303
00:22:28,697 --> 00:22:32,565
And it is not necessary for me to think
like a bull to know where Mario went.

304
00:22:32,734 --> 00:22:35,294
Oh, you're beginning to cackle
like an old hen.

305
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,836
Oh, I'm a hen now. Oh, right.

306
00:22:38,006 --> 00:22:39,439
But let me tell you something.

307
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,168
You cannot fight a bull without rest.
You just can't.

308
00:22:42,344 --> 00:22:46,041
Tomorrow is his birthday. His friends
wanna give him a little party, that's all.

309
00:22:46,214 --> 00:22:47,806
A little party, how sweet.

310
00:22:47,983 --> 00:22:50,918
Tonight, they give him a party.
Tomorrow, he gives them a party.

311
00:22:51,086 --> 00:22:52,348
You know as well as I do...

312
00:22:52,521 --> 00:22:55,752
...when he gets together
with those musicians, he stays out all night.

313
00:22:55,924 --> 00:22:59,325
- He'll be all right tomorrow.
- Don't always defend him. It's all wrong.

314
00:22:59,494 --> 00:23:02,691
With Señor Barrios coming all the way
from MeXico City to watch him.

315
00:23:02,864 --> 00:23:05,230
It's a very important day, and...

316

No, I'm sorry.
This time, I will have to tell your father.

Oh, no, you won't.

318

- Why won't I?
- You know why.

319
00:23:11,406 --> 00:23:14,466
- Why?
- Because you never have and you never will.

320
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,873
Come on. Come on, baby.

Thank you, old goat.

Now I'm a goat.

00:24:35,624 --> 00:24:36,921
Hey, Maria.

336
00:24:37,092 --> 00:24:39,822
All right, darling. Just a moment.

00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:05,044
Ah, Pepe, I'm so glad to see you.

338
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,121
All day long, just one thought
has been running around my head:

339
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,019
When will Pepe get here? When?

340
00:25:10,192 --> 00:25:13,093
Music, music to my ears.
Now let me tell you the big news.

341
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,819
- About Mario?
- No, about us.

342
00:25:14,996 --> 00:25:17,658
You did take Mario's music
to Señor Contreras, didn't you?

343
00:25:17,832 --> 00:25:21,563
- Yes, I did, but something came up...
- You don't think Mario's music is important?

344
00:25:21,736 --> 00:25:23,966
- Did Contreras play it?
- Will you let me...?

345
00:25:24,139 --> 00:25:27,131
Contreras must be a fool
if he doesn't like my brother's music.

346
00:25:27,309 --> 00:25:30,369
Instead of conducting an orchestra,
he ought to be on the street...

347
00:25:30,545 --> 00:25:33,742
...blowing a tin horn...
- Will you let me tell you what he said?

348
00:25:33,915 --> 00:25:36,406
That's what I'm waiting for, darling.
What did he say?

349
00:25:36,585 --> 00:25:37,609
Nothing.

350
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,550
Nothing? How could he possibly
say nothing?

351
00:25:40,722 --> 00:25:43,850
- Play that music once, and...
- He played it more than once.

352
00:25:44,025 --> 00:25:46,926
He played it over and over.
He got so eXcited he couldn't talk.

353
00:25:47,095 --> 00:25:49,620
- Now, will you let me tell you...?
- I knew he'd love it.

354
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,858
Oh, that's wonderful.
He's gonna play it with his orchestra.

355
00:25:53,034 --> 00:25:55,332
- He is, isn't it, Pepe?
- I don't know.

356
00:25:55,503 --> 00:25:58,165
He's coming tomorrow.
He's coming to see Mario personally.

357
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:01,776
Here? Oh, Pepe,
thank you for doing this for Mario.

358
00:26:01,943 --> 00:26:04,969
He'll be so happy. Oh, this is wonderful.

359
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,340
Now, will you...

360
00:26:06,514 --> 00:26:10,177
...let me tell you something about us?
- Don't say a word to Mario. Not a word.

361
00:26:10,352 --> 00:26:12,513
- What now?
- Well, don't you see?

362
00:26:12,687 --> 00:26:16,350
Mario won't know anything about it.
Tomorrow will be like any other birthday.

363
00:26:16,524 --> 00:26:18,788
And then, suddenly, someone comes to him
and says:

364
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,520
"Mario, there's a gentleman
to see you from MeXico City.

365
00:26:21,696 --> 00:26:24,722
A Señor MaXimino Contreras,
about the music you sent him."

366
00:26:24,899 --> 00:26:27,459
Oh, it will be the greatest moment
in Mario's life.

367
00:26:27,636 --> 00:26:29,263
And in yours.

368
00:26:29,437 --> 00:26:31,564
Yes, darling, it will.

369
00:26:31,873 --> 00:26:33,204
Everything is Mario.

370
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:35,707
Mario and his music.
Mario and his bullfighting.

371
00:26:35,877 --> 00:26:38,869
- Mario this. Mario...
- Darling, it's only natural. He's my twin.

372
00:26:39,047 --> 00:26:41,481
I know that, but I'm marrying you.

373
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,049
All of you, but only you.

374
00:26:43,218 --> 00:26:44,913
I like Mario. He's a wonderful guy.

375
00:26:45,086 --> 00:26:48,021
He'll be the best brother-in-law
I ever had in my life.

376
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:50,453
But there's one thing
I want you to understand.

377
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:53,753
After we married, you're not gonna take
an aspirin every time he has a headache.

380
00:26:59,467 --> 00:27:01,298
All right, now about us.

381
00:27:01,469 --> 00:27:04,597
I received an offer
from the Institute of Research of New York.

382
00:27:04,773 --> 00:27:08,231
- We're gonna have to live there for a year.
- Darling, that's wonderful.

383
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,672
But there's something else.

384
00:27:09,844 --> 00:27:11,436
I don't know when I have to leave.

385
00:27:11,613 --> 00:27:13,877
We may not be able to wait months
to get married.

386
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,880
- It might be three weeks.
- Three weeks?

387
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,349
Maybe less time.
It depends on when they need me.

388
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,717
Well, darling, that sounds grand,
New York for a whole year, but...

389
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,949
Well, suppose Mario needs a...

390
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:27,253
Oh. Mario again.

391
00:27:27,996 --> 00:27:29,657
What, darling?

392
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:33,390
The only time you seem to be happy
is when you're doing something for Mario.

393
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:36,503
Pepe, wait a moment. I'm sorry.

394
00:27:36,771 --> 00:27:38,398
All right.

395
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,970
Will you leave on short notice
if we have to?

396
00:27:41,142 --> 00:27:43,235
Any time you say.

397
00:27:50,151 --> 00:27:51,175

398
00:27:51,353 --> 00:27:53,048
- It's good to see you.
- Thank you.

405
00:28:10,972 --> 00:28:15,409
Oh. The last time I saw you, Pepe,
you were terribly eXcited.

406
00:28:15,577 --> 00:28:18,375
You were looking
for a very important bug.

407
00:28:18,546 --> 00:28:21,947
- Well, have you found it?
- Not yet.

Why not?

409
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:26,113
Well, for one thing,
we don't know what it looks like.

he wouldn't know what it looks like.

Yes, he wants you to be very proud
of him tomorrow.

to be proud of him tomorrow...

Do you remember the night
of Mario's birthday party?

748

would take Mario's music away from him...

And yet you deliberately destroyed
the thing he loved.

753

01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:29,842
...I was very happy, Antonio.

he wanted to.

764
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:36,147
For himself...

765
01:00:36,316 --> 01:00:39,547
...not to satisfy your pride.

766
01:00:40,019 --> 01:00:42,249

In 20 years...

768
01:00:44,257 --> 01:00:46,919
...in all the time I trained him...

769
01:00:47,293 --> 01:00:48,555
...you haven't said a word.

770
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:50,525
No, Antonio.

771
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:53,426
I didn't say anything
when you were fighting either.

772
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:56,466
But I lived only when you did not fight.

773
01:00:56,636 --> 01:00:58,661
Then in fear.

774
01:00:58,971 --> 01:01:01,940
Fear of what would happen
when you fought again.

775
01:01:02,642 --> 01:01:04,667
When, finally, you were hurt...

776
01:01:04,844 --> 01:01:07,938
...all of MeXico, yes, all of Spain, even...

777

...wept.

778
01:01:10,516 --> 01:01:12,677
I wept too.

779

Mine were tears of relief...

780
01:01:16,723 --> 01:01:19,055
...you'd never fight again.

781
01:01:20,554 --> 01:01:23,455
And now Mario will never fight again.

782
01:01:24,391 --> 01:01:27,519
And for that, I am very thankful.

783

in my room when he comes home.

01:02:02,129 --> 01:02:05,223
No. And you are not leaving here, Maria.

791
01:02:05,399 --> 01:02:07,799
- Father, I have to. You saw Mother...
MORALES: He'll be back.

792
01:02:07,968 --> 01:02:10,300
The moment he's hungry, he'll be home.
Don't worry.

793
01:02:10,471 --> 01:02:11,495
No, father.

794
01:02:11,672 --> 01:02:13,765
I'm going to find him somehow.

795
01:02:13,941 --> 01:02:15,875
I forbid you.

796
01:02:16,043 --> 01:02:19,809
Maria, do you understand
that you are to stay home?

797
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:21,538
I'll go with you, Maria.

798
01:02:23,450 --> 01:02:24,678
Do you understand?

799
01:02:24,852 --> 01:02:27,343
You are not to leave.

800
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:36,962
Whenever you want to start, Maria,
I'm ready.

801
01:02:37,131 --> 01:02:38,996
Well, wait a minute.
Where are you going?

802
01:02:39,166 --> 01:02:42,829
Start where? If Mario wanted to be here,
you wouldn't have to look for him.

803
01:02:43,003 --> 01:02:45,437
If he insists on staying away,
you'll never find him.

804
01:02:45,606 --> 01:02:48,507
A needle in a haystack
is not hard to find...

805
01:02:48,676 --> 01:02:50,075
...if you have a magnet.

806
01:02:50,244 --> 01:02:52,178
They can't call Mario a coward.

807
01:02:52,346 --> 01:02:55,406
- I'm gonna demand they print the truth.
- They don't know the truth.

808
01:02:55,582 --> 01:02:57,777
They would question your father.

809
01:02:57,951 --> 01:02:59,111
I don't care.

810
01:02:59,286 --> 01:03:00,981
They've got to take it back.

811
01:03:01,155 --> 01:03:03,919
A Morales is not a coward.

812
01:03:07,328 --> 01:03:08,556
I'll prove it to them.

813
01:03:08,729 --> 01:03:10,492
PEPE: Maria.
- Yes, I'll prove it to them.

814
01:03:10,664 --> 01:03:13,098
I'll go see Barrios.
He'll give me a chance to fight.

815
01:03:13,534 --> 01:03:14,660
- You will not.
MARIA: Why not?

816
01:03:14,835 --> 01:03:16,962
Why not? What about us?

817
01:03:18,639 --> 01:03:20,470
You think that would bring Mario home?

818
01:03:20,641 --> 01:03:22,939
- Maybe.
- No, just the opposite.

819
01:03:23,110 --> 01:03:25,874
If you fight, it doesn't prove
your brother is not a coward.

820
01:03:26,046 --> 01:03:27,536
You'd only make it worse.

821
01:03:27,715 --> 01:03:30,946
It would seem you were doing something
your brother was afraid to do.

822
01:03:31,118 --> 01:03:34,087
It would be a disgrace for Mario.
He'd never be able to return.

823
01:03:34,722 --> 01:03:36,986
Can't you see
I'm telling you the truth, darling?

824
01:03:38,225 --> 01:03:40,090
We'll find Mario. I promise you.

825
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:44,026
That's right. It is not the name of Morales
that has to be cleared.

826
01:03:44,198 --> 01:03:46,393
It's Mario's.

827
01:03:46,567 --> 01:03:48,728
Only he can do it.

828
01:03:49,336 --> 01:03:50,928
Yes.

829
01:03:51,105 --> 01:03:53,130
Only Mario.

830
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:06,442
No, no, not the good ones.
Give me the bad ones.

831
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:09,646
I understand.
Everybody buys the bad ones.

832
01:04:09,823 --> 01:04:12,519
Mario Morales. I can't wait.

833
01:04:12,693 --> 01:04:14,593
The promoter had better lock the gate.

834
01:04:14,762 --> 01:04:18,425
Yeah. Maybe Morales
will jump over the wall today.

835
01:04:19,333 --> 01:04:21,597
Your public seems to be
a little temperamental.

836
01:04:21,769 --> 01:04:24,863
Oh, don't worry.
They're just in a playful mood.

837
01:04:25,038 --> 01:04:26,869
Yes, I see.

838
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:30,601
I wouldn't want to see damage done
to your magnificent establishment.

839
01:04:30,778 --> 01:04:33,747
So say, perhaps, we would call off
this engagement.

840
01:04:33,914 --> 01:04:35,313
Are you crazy?

841
01:04:35,482 --> 01:04:38,679
Call off the most profitable day
I have had in five years?

842
01:04:38,852 --> 01:04:40,717
- Yes.
- Come, old man. Get your man ready.

843
01:04:40,888 --> 01:04:43,083
Yes, I think, uh...

844
01:04:50,297 --> 01:04:51,992
There.

845
01:04:58,205 --> 01:05:00,173
Please, Maria, don't go through with this.

846
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:02,001
We can find him some other way.

847
01:05:02,176 --> 01:05:03,905
We could advertise in the newspapers.

848
01:05:04,077 --> 01:05:07,478
There's one way to find Mario.
When he reads the papers and finds out...

849
01:05:07,648 --> 01:05:11,015
...somebody is fighting under his name...
- I know, but it's so dangerous.

850
01:05:11,185 --> 01:05:14,643
- Lf anything should happen to you...
- Will you please stop saying that?

851
01:05:14,822 --> 01:05:16,187

Oh, no, not so big.

855
01:05:31,305 --> 01:05:34,274
You know, Maria,
I've had the most wonderful idea.

856
01:05:34,441 --> 01:05:37,274
- What?
- In Monterrey, I have many relatives.

857
01:05:37,444 --> 01:05:42,245
If we went there right away, we could
get them to start looking all over for Mario.

858
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:47,082
If you're in a hurry to see your relatives,
you can leave right now.

859
01:05:47,488 --> 01:05:51,049
I made a mistake. I should never
have let you talk me into this.

860
01:05:51,225 --> 01:05:52,385
It's crazy.

861
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:55,687
If anything happens,
how could I ever answer for this?

862
01:05:55,863 --> 01:05:59,594
Not only to your father, but to myself.

863
01:06:01,468 --> 01:06:02,833
Look, Chato...

to bring Mario back. This way.

It's my responsibility.

866
01:06:10,444 --> 01:06:13,106
It isn't fair to ask you to share it.

867
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:14,611
What?

868
01:06:14,781 --> 01:06:17,181
To let you go down there alone?

869
01:06:18,185 --> 01:06:19,277
Come.

870
01:06:19,453 --> 01:06:21,648
It's bad luck to be late.

871
01:06:29,229 --> 01:06:31,129
I'll wait outside.

872
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,511

You know, Chato,
there's one thing worrying me.

What's that?

876

Before it's too late. Please.

883

They don't need to worry.

884
01:07:57,184 --> 01:07:59,448
The only way I'll go out
is to be carried out.

not because he thought you were right.

01:15:42,082 --> 01:15:44,915
You better eat. We got a long way to go.

949
01:15:45,085 --> 01:15:46,177
I'm not hungry.

950
01:15:46,352 --> 01:15:48,877
The bus ride bumped his stomach. Ha, ha.

951
01:15:50,457 --> 01:15:53,017
Is that music coming all the way
from the United States?

952
01:15:53,193 --> 01:15:54,251
Oh, no, señor.

953
01:15:54,427 --> 01:15:56,793
That is our symphony orchestra
in MeXico City.

954
01:15:57,363 --> 01:15:59,831
With Maestro
MaXimino Contreras conducting.

955
01:15:59,999 --> 01:16:01,432
(SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

956
01:16:03,103 --> 01:16:06,231
I'm afraid, uh, Pancho isn't very fond
of music.

957
01:16:06,940 --> 01:16:09,704
And I am afraid you have
the wrong impression of my country.

958
01:16:09,876 --> 01:16:12,174
Not everyone in MeXico
appreciates music.

959
01:16:12,345 --> 01:16:13,642
Many prefer bullfighting.

960
01:16:13,813 --> 01:16:16,043
MAN (ON RADIO):
<i>The final selection of today's concert...</i>

961
01:16:16,216 --> 01:16:17,513
<i>... will be "Fantasia Mexicana"...</i>

962
01:16:17,684 --> 01:16:21,211
<i>... the work of a young Mexican composer,</i>
<i>Mario Morales.</i>

963
01:16:21,387 --> 01:16:24,982
<i>It is being introduced today</i>
<i>for the first time to the people of Mexico...</i>

964
01:16:25,158 --> 01:16:28,491
<i>... by Maestro Maximino Contreras.</i>

(CROWD CHEERING)

968
01:21:32,465 --> 01:21:33,591
Wait a minute, Pancho.

969
01:21:33,766 --> 01:21:36,234
The radio said it was being played
for the first time.

970
01:21:36,402 --> 01:21:39,428
- Now, you told me...
- Don't get the wrong impression, señor.

971
01:21:39,605 --> 01:21:42,165
Not everyone in MeXico
lives only for bullfighting.

972
01:21:42,341 --> 01:21:44,832
- Just as many prefer music.
- Hmm?

973
01:21:45,178 --> 01:21:47,476
Wait! Wait!

974
01:21:54,454 --> 01:21:56,285
No, no, señor. You must not enter.

975
01:21:56,456 --> 01:21:59,152
He is busy. He will see no one.

976
01:21:59,325 --> 01:22:01,555
(PLAYING PIANO THEN STOPS)

977
01:22:03,196 --> 01:22:04,424
Mario!

978
01:22:04,897 --> 01:22:07,593
I'm sorry, señor.
He would not give his name.

979
01:22:07,767 --> 01:22:10,065
You may go.
Mario, so you heard it, huh?

980
01:22:10,236 --> 01:22:11,294
Yes.

981
01:22:11,471 --> 01:22:13,803
Oh, I knew it.
I knew it was the only way.

982
01:22:13,973 --> 01:22:15,804
I had to come, maestro, to thank you.

983
01:22:15,975 --> 01:22:17,909
It was... Well, I have no words.

984
01:22:18,077 --> 01:22:21,171
It didn't sound like my music at all.
It was so big.

985
01:22:21,347 --> 01:22:22,814
Oh, of course it was.

986
01:22:22,982 --> 01:22:26,008
Mario, when your sister told me
that she had a way to find you...

987
01:22:26,185 --> 01:22:29,348
...I said to myself, there is only one way
to bring him back.

988
01:22:29,522 --> 01:22:30,921
And it worked.

989
01:22:31,090 --> 01:22:33,058
Now, my boy,
we'll get down to business.

990
01:22:33,226 --> 01:22:34,591
To study music.

991
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:37,320
- Of course, no more bullfighting.
- No.

992
01:22:37,497 --> 01:22:39,055
No, I'm all through with that.

993
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:42,668
Fine. You know, my boy,
it was very foolish of you.

994
01:22:42,835 --> 01:22:44,666
- You don't understand...
- No, no, please.

995
01:22:44,837 --> 01:22:46,498
You have nothing to eXplain.

996
01:22:46,672 --> 01:22:49,004
I know it was your father.
Anyway, it was foolish.

997
01:22:49,175 --> 01:22:51,666
Why risk your life
just to prove to some people...

998
01:22:51,844 --> 01:22:54,438
...who read the sporting news
that you are not a coward?

999
01:22:54,614 --> 01:22:56,241
It's ridiculous.

1000
01:22:56,415 --> 01:22:59,282
Of course, now, after you had
your big success at La Scala...

1001
01:22:59,452 --> 01:23:02,580
...and you're a hero in your father's eyes,
everybody's happy.

1002
01:23:02,755 --> 01:23:05,918
Don't eXplain to me
and don't argue with me.

1003
01:23:06,092 --> 01:23:08,617
This foolishness is over once and forever.

1004
01:23:08,794 --> 01:23:11,160
You must not risk your life again.

1005
01:23:11,330 --> 01:23:13,457
Uh, and I insist
that you cancel your engagement...

1006
01:23:13,633 --> 01:23:15,123
...you have to fight at Puebla.

1007
01:23:15,868 --> 01:23:18,962
I don't know what you're talking about,
Señor Contreras.

1008
01:23:19,138 --> 01:23:20,765
I didn't fight in La Scala.

1009
01:23:21,207 --> 01:23:23,141
And I am not fighting in Puebla.

1010
01:23:23,309 --> 01:23:24,537
I'm not.

1011
01:23:24,710 --> 01:23:25,768
Now, wait, my boy.

1012
01:23:25,945 --> 01:23:29,381
We can't get along unless we are
really frank and honest to each other.

1013
01:23:29,549 --> 01:23:31,517
Come. I'll show you.

1014
01:23:36,122 --> 01:23:37,282
Oh, here.

1015
01:23:37,456 --> 01:23:38,855
Here.

1016
01:23:42,061 --> 01:23:44,427
- EXcuse me.
- Where do you think you are going?

1017
01:23:44,597 --> 01:23:45,791
Well, it's obvious, señor.

1018
01:23:45,965 --> 01:23:48,798
If someone is using my name,
I have the right to...

1019
01:23:51,137 --> 01:23:54,504
Did you say my sister told you
she had a plan to find me?

1020
01:23:54,674 --> 01:23:55,834
Yes.

1021
01:23:56,008 --> 01:23:57,999
- I must go.
- Wait! Mario...

1022
01:23:58,177 --> 01:23:59,405
Oh, he runs away again.

1023
01:23:59,579 --> 01:24:02,275
Oh, I'll chase this boy
to my appointments.

1024
01:24:02,448 --> 01:24:04,541
Mario, wait!

1025
01:24:04,817 --> 01:24:07,308
No. Maria, please.

1026
01:24:07,486 --> 01:24:09,113
Please stop being so nervous.

1027
01:24:09,288 --> 01:24:10,915
MARIA:
I can't understand it.

1028
01:24:11,090 --> 01:24:13,684
Mario's name has been in every newspaper
for two weeks.

1029
01:24:13,859 --> 01:24:15,884
Today's fight has been announced
all over.

1030
01:24:16,062 --> 01:24:17,893
- He must have seen it.
- He'll be here.

1031
01:24:18,064 --> 01:24:20,498
He'll be here. Don't worry, please.

1032
01:24:20,666 --> 01:24:21,690
Sit down.

1033
01:24:21,867 --> 01:24:23,164
(PHONE RINGS)

1034
01:24:23,336 --> 01:24:25,804
- It's Mario. Mario.
- Mario.

1035
01:24:26,706 --> 01:24:29,607
Darling. Where are you?

1036
01:24:30,910 --> 01:24:32,468
Pepe.

1037
01:24:32,645 --> 01:24:34,078
Where are you?

1038
01:24:34,246 --> 01:24:36,510
Where do you think?
I'm downstairs in the lobby.

1039
01:24:36,682 --> 01:24:38,240
How did you know I was here?

1040
01:24:38,417 --> 01:24:42,080
Darling, all I had to do was find out
where Mario is staying and I'd find you.

1041
01:24:42,955 --> 01:24:46,118
Oh, no, no, Pepe,
you can't come up here.

1042
01:24:46,325 --> 01:24:48,691
Mario is not feeling well.

1043
01:24:48,861 --> 01:24:50,726
Mario isn't feeling very well, Pepe.

1044
01:24:50,896 --> 01:24:53,626
He's very nervous.

1045
01:24:53,799 --> 01:24:55,960
He's not seeing anybody.

1046
01:24:56,135 --> 01:24:59,298
No, no, he's just tired.

1047
01:24:59,639 --> 01:25:01,504
Darling, I'll come right down.

1048
01:25:01,674 --> 01:25:03,574
Yes, yes, I promise. Right away.

1049
01:25:03,743 --> 01:25:05,540
No, you can't. I won't allow you.

1050
01:25:05,711 --> 01:25:07,576
Chato, I have to. He can't come up here.

1051
01:25:07,747 --> 01:25:09,578
You've got to get dressed, Maria.

1052
01:25:09,749 --> 01:25:12,183
- What are you going to tell him?
- I don't know.

1053
01:25:12,351 --> 01:25:16,151
- Nothing. Nothing.
CHATO: Good. I'll tell it to him with you.

1054
01:25:24,897 --> 01:25:27,627
Darling. Ha, ha.

1055
01:25:29,468 --> 01:25:32,369
What happened to you?
I could've lost my mind waiting for you.

1056
01:25:32,538 --> 01:25:36,030
- Darling, I'm so sorry. You see, it was...
- All right, you found her now.

1057
01:25:36,208 --> 01:25:38,005
Kiss her and say goodbye.

1058
01:25:38,177 --> 01:25:39,576
Mario needs her.

1059
01:25:39,745 --> 01:25:40,973
He's very nervous.

1060
01:25:41,147 --> 01:25:43,081
I'm nervous too.

1061
01:25:43,249 --> 01:25:44,273
- Guess what.
- What?

1062
01:25:44,450 --> 01:25:48,216
I received my appointment with the Institute
of Research, New York. It's ours.

1063
01:25:48,387 --> 01:25:50,651
Look. Telegrams,
documents, airplane tickets.

1064
01:25:50,823 --> 01:25:53,189
We leave tomorrow morning at 6:00.

1065
01:25:53,993 --> 01:25:57,292
- Oh, no, Pepe. We can't.
- No.

1066
01:25:58,230 --> 01:25:59,492
Why not?

1067
01:26:00,433 --> 01:26:03,095
Well, to begin with,
we're not even married.

1068
01:26:03,269 --> 01:26:04,759
Yes.

1069
01:26:06,072 --> 01:26:08,267
That's why I came.
I've got that arranged too.

1070
01:26:08,441 --> 01:26:10,432
- Come on.
- No.

1071
01:26:11,610 --> 01:26:13,407
- Did you say something?
- Who? L...

1072
01:26:13,579 --> 01:26:14,978
Did I say something?

1073
01:26:15,147 --> 01:26:16,171
No.

1074
01:26:16,348 --> 01:26:18,213
Darling, I know that I promised, but l...

1075
01:26:18,384 --> 01:26:21,615
I tell you,
Mario is more nervous than ever.

1076
01:26:21,787 --> 01:26:24,255
He wouldn't fight if she wouldn't...

1077
01:26:27,426 --> 01:26:29,485
I knew the test
would come one day, Maria...

1078
01:26:29,662 --> 01:26:31,653
...somehow or another.

1079
01:26:32,198 --> 01:26:33,825
After everything we'd planned...

1080
01:26:33,999 --> 01:26:35,933
...for a lifetime.

1081
01:26:36,235 --> 01:26:39,636
Against one afternoon
of watching your brother fight a bull.

1082
01:26:47,012 --> 01:26:49,344
You say you have everything arranged?

1083
01:26:49,515 --> 01:26:50,880
PEPE:
Yes, darling.

1084
01:26:51,050 --> 01:26:52,642
Everything.

1085
01:26:52,852 --> 01:26:54,820
All right, darling.

1086
01:26:56,021 --> 01:26:58,148
There's just one thing, Pepe.

1087
01:26:58,324 --> 01:27:01,418
You've got to get me back here
by 3:00.

1088
01:27:01,727 --> 01:27:02,989
What for?

1089
01:27:03,162 --> 01:27:04,857
You've got to, Pepe.

1090
01:27:05,297 --> 01:27:06,992
PEPE:
To see your brother?

1091
01:27:07,566 --> 01:27:09,864
Whose honeymoon is this gonna be?

1092
01:27:10,035 --> 01:27:11,866
Will you, Pepe?

1093
01:27:13,439 --> 01:27:14,997
All right.

1094
01:27:16,075 --> 01:27:19,374
- Tell Mario I'll be back at 3:00.
- Yes.

1095
01:27:19,545 --> 01:27:21,012
Come on.

1096
01:27:42,701 --> 01:27:43,998
Chato, I want you to meet...

1097
01:27:44,170 --> 01:27:48,266
...Señora Maria Morales Jose Fernandez
Hector Sanchez Tello Giermillo Ortego.

1098
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:50,305
Yes, yes, yes. Now hurry, hurry.

1099
01:27:50,476 --> 01:27:52,671
Mario is very nervous.

1100
01:27:52,845 --> 01:27:54,039
You won't be able to stay.

1101
01:27:54,213 --> 01:27:55,771
Just pack your things.

1102
01:27:55,948 --> 01:27:58,781
MARIA: Yes, darling, I know.
PEPE: Hurry.

1103
01:27:59,218 --> 01:28:01,778
Uh, Pepe, you wait for her here.

1104
01:28:01,954 --> 01:28:04,616
- But I wanna see Mario.
- No.

1105
01:28:04,790 --> 01:28:06,621
If anything should happen, don't worry.

1106
01:28:06,792 --> 01:28:09,226
- Maria will meet you at the entrance.
- What entrance?

1107
01:28:09,395 --> 01:28:13,024
In case you miss her at the entrance,
she will meet you at this seat.

1108
01:28:13,199 --> 01:28:14,496
Wait, why should I miss her?

1109
01:28:14,667 --> 01:28:18,694
- I don't wanna see the bullfight.
- Don't worry. From that seat, you won't.

1110
01:28:24,810 --> 01:28:26,573
The number of my son's suite.

1111
01:28:26,745 --> 01:28:28,269
Your son?

1112
01:28:28,447 --> 01:28:30,938
Mario Morales, the torero.

1113
01:28:31,183 --> 01:28:32,707
Don Antonio.

1114
01:28:32,885 --> 01:28:34,318
I beg your pardon, señor.

1115
01:28:34,486 --> 01:28:37,011
- Suite 401403.
- Thank you.

1116
01:28:37,189 --> 01:28:38,486
For nothing, señor.

1117
01:28:43,462 --> 01:28:45,054
Pepe.

1118
01:28:45,431 --> 01:28:49,060
- Oh, hello, maestro.
- Why are you not upstairs with Mario?

1119
01:28:49,235 --> 01:28:50,634
He won't see me.

1120
01:28:50,803 --> 01:28:52,430
He won't see anybody eXcept Maria.

1121
01:28:52,605 --> 01:28:56,200
- Why not?
- I don't know. He says he's nervous.

1122
01:28:56,508 --> 01:28:58,373
We'll fiX that.

1123
01:28:58,544 --> 01:29:01,809
You know, Pepe, Mario and I,
we had a little misunderstanding.

1124
01:29:01,981 --> 01:29:04,973
But he's young.
He would not come to me...

1125
01:29:05,150 --> 01:29:08,347
...so I'll go to him.

1126
01:29:13,025 --> 01:29:14,856
MAN 1: Señor Morales.
MAN 2: Señor Morales.

1127
01:29:15,027 --> 01:29:18,155
- We need your help.
- Please help us to get some pictures.

1128
01:29:18,330 --> 01:29:21,527
- Would you help us get some pictures?
- We've been here for two hours.

1129
01:29:21,700 --> 01:29:22,724
Leave it to me.

1130
01:29:22,902 --> 01:29:27,339
Just give me a few minutes with my son,
alone, and it'll be all right.

1131
01:29:28,274 --> 01:29:29,605
(KNOCKING)

1132
01:29:34,079 --> 01:29:35,944
- So.
- Maestro, I, uh...

1133
01:29:36,115 --> 01:29:37,605
Please tell my son I'm here.

1134
01:29:37,783 --> 01:29:40,650
- Tell him we're here a long time.
- Yeah.

1135
01:29:40,819 --> 01:29:43,788
Yes, yes. Just a moment, please.

1136
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:50,752
- What's happened now?
- Your father and Pepe are outside.

1137
01:29:50,930 --> 01:29:53,956
Hurry, Conchita.
We've gotta get out of here.

1138
01:29:54,133 --> 01:29:56,033
Where's Mario? Why didn't he come?

1139
01:29:56,201 --> 01:29:59,568
Did you hear what I said?
Your father and Pepe are outside that door.

1140
01:29:59,738 --> 01:30:01,933
If your father finds out, he'll kill me.

1141
01:30:02,107 --> 01:30:03,734
If he doesn't, Pepe will.

1142
01:30:03,909 --> 01:30:05,035
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

1143
01:30:05,210 --> 01:30:07,906
MORALES:
Chato. Mario.

1144
01:30:08,547 --> 01:30:10,708
Quick. Quick.

1145
01:30:11,016 --> 01:30:12,449
Hurry.

1146
01:30:16,455 --> 01:30:19,686
It's crazy.
It's been crazy from the beginning.

1147
01:30:21,427 --> 01:30:23,520
I've had enough of this nonsense, Chato.

1148
01:30:23,696 --> 01:30:26,665
- Get out of the way.
- No. If you please, just a few minutes.

1149
01:30:26,832 --> 01:30:28,322
Oh, he's so nervous.

1150
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:30,730
Everybody's nervous before a fight.

1151
01:30:30,903 --> 01:30:32,928
- Step aside.
- No, no, please, not yet.

1152
01:30:33,105 --> 01:30:35,005
- We gotta have pictures.
- Who does he think he is?

1153
01:30:35,174 --> 01:30:37,074
Please, gentlemen. Please be patient.

1154
01:30:37,242 --> 01:30:39,301
I'll see if he's, uh...

1155
01:30:39,478 --> 01:30:41,810
I'll see if he's still praying.

1156
01:30:44,049 --> 01:30:46,574
You would think
that he was the boy's father.

1157
01:30:46,752 --> 01:30:48,413
Wait until I get him home.

1158
01:30:48,587 --> 01:30:51,454
- About 4:00.
- The fight will be starting soon.

1159
01:30:51,623 --> 01:30:54,285
Maybe he isn't
going to fight today either.

1160
01:30:54,460 --> 01:30:55,757
What do you think, maestro?

1161
01:30:55,928 --> 01:30:57,259
Oh, this is too much.

1162
01:30:57,429 --> 01:31:00,330
Chato. Mario. Open the door.

1163
01:31:00,499 --> 01:31:02,228
You hear me?

1164
01:31:15,581 --> 01:31:17,446
But it's impossible. L...

1165
01:31:17,616 --> 01:31:19,345
I didn't...

1166
01:31:19,718 --> 01:31:22,983
All I wanted is to give him my sword.

1167
01:31:23,155 --> 01:31:24,486
(PLAYING TRUMPET)

1168
01:31:35,067 --> 01:31:37,797
- Lf Mario doesn't come out...
- Please. We'll find Mario.

1169
01:31:37,970 --> 01:31:40,837
You stop looking around
while you're working the bull.

1170
01:31:47,913 --> 01:31:50,211
Watch the bull, please.

1171
01:31:55,087 --> 01:31:57,146
All right. Go now.

1172
01:32:03,929 --> 01:32:05,294
(CROWD CHEERING)

1173
01:32:33,792 --> 01:32:34,952
She must be inside.

1174
01:32:35,127 --> 01:32:37,925
Well, go in there and find her. Go ahead.

1175
01:32:38,097 --> 01:32:40,463
You're making me nervous.

1176
01:32:53,011 --> 01:32:55,206
Mario, wait!

1177
01:33:03,255 --> 01:33:04,688
- Ticket?
CONTRERAS: I don't have any.

1178
01:33:04,857 --> 01:33:06,950
Ticket over there, please.

1179
01:33:07,726 --> 01:33:11,162
- Oh, no, my friend.
- I don't consider myself your friend.

1180
01:33:11,330 --> 01:33:13,560
And then, please,
would you kindly step aside?

1181
01:33:13,732 --> 01:33:18,328
Go back to scraping on your fiddle.
You will not interfere with my son again.

1182
01:33:18,504 --> 01:33:21,098
Step aside, please.
Let the gentlemen buy his ticket.

1183
01:33:21,273 --> 01:33:22,740
You are mistaken on two counts.

1184
01:33:22,908 --> 01:33:25,934
He's not a gentleman
and he's not going to buy a ticket.

1185
01:33:26,111 --> 01:33:29,080
Señor, will you kindly
have this person removed?

1186
01:33:29,248 --> 01:33:30,374
Call the police.

1187
01:33:30,549 --> 01:33:33,109
CONTRERAS: See to my rights.
- What seems to be the trouble?

1188
01:33:33,285 --> 01:33:35,446
- Look, l...
- I'll do the eXplaining.

1189
01:33:35,621 --> 01:33:36,849
I am Don Antonio Morales.

1190
01:33:37,022 --> 01:33:39,650
Don Antonio.

1191
01:33:39,825 --> 01:33:41,656
Is this criminal annoying you, maestro?

1192
01:33:41,827 --> 01:33:45,024
Criminal? I am MaXimino Contreras
of the National Symphony Orchestra.

1193
01:33:45,197 --> 01:33:48,963
Maestro. Is this broken-down bullfighter
annoying you?

1194
01:33:49,134 --> 01:33:52,194
No. You'll address the greatest matador
of all times with respect.

1195
01:33:52,371 --> 01:33:55,602
You will address the greatest musician
in MeXico with reverence.

1196
01:33:55,774 --> 01:33:59,005
- He wants to stop my son from fighting.
- We won't let him.

1197
01:33:59,178 --> 01:34:01,476
It's against the law
to prevent a man from buying a ticket.

1198
01:34:01,647 --> 01:34:03,638
It's against the law
to interfere with a bullfight.

1199
01:34:03,815 --> 01:34:05,715
You can't prove
that he intends to interfere.

1200
01:34:05,884 --> 01:34:07,511
All right.
We'll go see the captain.

1201
01:34:07,686 --> 01:34:08,880
- He'll settle this.
- Good.

1202
01:34:09,054 --> 01:34:10,646
But I have to get in, please.

1203
01:34:10,822 --> 01:34:13,416
Yes. Yes. Let's see the captain.
He'll settle this.

1204
01:34:13,592 --> 01:34:15,389
- Come, señores.
- Good.

1205
01:34:22,668 --> 01:34:24,397
Mario.

1206
01:35:29,901 --> 01:35:31,960
(SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

1207
01:35:39,411 --> 01:35:41,845
- Mario.
- Look out, Maria!

1208
01:35:42,014 --> 01:35:43,072
(WOMEN SCREAMING)

1209
01:36:04,169 --> 01:36:07,866
MARIA: I'm fine. Put me down, I'm fine.
- Yes, dear.

1210
01:36:08,307 --> 01:36:10,366
Are you all right?
You're not hurt, are you?

1211
01:36:10,542 --> 01:36:13,033
Oh, Mario. Oh, I knew I'd find you.

1212
01:36:13,211 --> 01:36:14,803
(CROWD CHEERING)

1213
01:36:33,732 --> 01:36:35,632
Maria.

1214
01:36:36,835 --> 01:36:38,860
Hello, Pepe.

1215
01:36:40,439 --> 01:36:42,634
That's what I wanna talk to you about.

1216
01:36:42,808 --> 01:36:45,971
Later. Later, Pepe.
Not in front of Mother, please.

1217
01:36:46,144 --> 01:36:47,270
- Pepe.
- Congratulations.

1218
01:36:47,446 --> 01:36:50,142
I'm so glad. I know you'll be very happy.

1219
01:36:50,315 --> 01:36:52,340
Where's Don Antonio?

1220
01:36:53,085 --> 01:36:56,077
Maria said she left him with you.
Didn't he come home with you?

1221
01:36:56,254 --> 01:36:57,380
We got separated.

1222
01:36:57,556 --> 01:36:58,682
Isn't he here yet?

1223
01:36:58,857 --> 01:37:00,449
I can't understand it.

1224
01:37:00,625 --> 01:37:02,991
He invited all these people
for a fiesta for you.

1225
01:37:03,161 --> 01:37:06,358
He'll be here any minute. Come on,
Mother, let's dance, huh? Come on.

1226
01:37:07,933 --> 01:37:10,197
Where is Father, Pepe?

1227
01:37:10,369 --> 01:37:13,634
He's probably having Barrios arrested
for letting you get in that ring.

1228
01:37:13,805 --> 01:37:16,740
- Where's Chato?
- I passed Chato at the gate, waiting for him.

1229
01:37:19,077 --> 01:37:21,341
Maestro, Don Antonio.

1230
01:37:21,813 --> 01:37:24,043
Is there something
I can do for you, señor?

1231
01:37:24,216 --> 01:37:25,649
Yes. Step aside, please.

1232
01:37:25,817 --> 01:37:28,377
We don't like to run over little animals
on the highway.

1233
01:37:28,553 --> 01:37:29,952
Go on.

1234
01:37:35,527 --> 01:37:37,119
CHATO:
Maestro.

1235
01:37:37,996 --> 01:37:40,430
Maestro, we're glad you're home.
We've been worried.

1236
01:37:40,599 --> 01:37:44,262
Chato, you are as trustworthy
as a scorpion.

1237
01:37:44,436 --> 01:37:48,270
It's a lucky thing for you
that everything went so well for me.

1238
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:50,169
I can almost forgive you.

1239
01:37:50,342 --> 01:37:52,037
Yes, life is good.

1240
01:37:52,210 --> 01:37:54,701
Good? What is good, Maestro?

1241
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:57,144
Who made it possible
for Mario to fight the bull?

1242
01:37:57,315 --> 01:37:59,681
You? No, I did it.

1243
01:37:59,851 --> 01:38:01,716
- You, maestro?
- Of course.

1244
01:38:01,887 --> 01:38:05,948
That crazy man, Contreras, showed up
outside of the bullring again today.

1245
01:38:06,124 --> 01:38:10,117
Well, I stopped him. I refused
to let him go in and create a disturbance.

1246
01:38:10,295 --> 01:38:12,559
By the time we were through
with eXplanations...

1247
01:38:12,731 --> 01:38:15,962
...at the office of the police captain,
the fights were over.

1248
01:38:16,134 --> 01:38:18,034
Oh, then, you didn't see the fight?

1249
01:38:18,203 --> 01:38:21,570
- No. Come inside and let me know about it.
- No, maestro. Please listen.

1250
01:38:21,740 --> 01:38:22,764
Listen to what?

1251
01:38:22,941 --> 01:38:24,875
So far we have told your wife nothing.

1252
01:38:25,043 --> 01:38:26,271
Nothing about what?

1253
01:38:26,445 --> 01:38:29,437
Maestro, you'll never know
how close Mario was to the end.

1254
01:38:29,614 --> 01:38:33,209
He was going beautifully when,
suddenly... You know his fault.

1255
01:38:33,385 --> 01:38:34,716
- He lost his concentration.

1256
01:38:34,886 --> 01:38:37,719
The bull swung
and threw Mario to the ground.

1257
01:38:37,889 --> 01:38:41,484
He was stunned.
The bull turned, saw him lying helpless.

1258
01:38:41,660 --> 01:38:42,991
He lowered his head.

1259
01:38:43,161 --> 01:38:45,857
Oh, the horns were within an inch
of Mario's body.

1260
01:38:46,031 --> 01:38:49,831
Then, all of a sudden, from nowhere,
a young man appeared.

1261
01:38:50,001 --> 01:38:53,903
He stepped over Mario's body
and used his own coat as a cape.

1262
01:38:54,072 --> 01:38:57,974
Oh, maestro, if that boy
had been one second later...

1263
01:38:58,143 --> 01:39:01,271
...you'd never have been able
to come home and face your wife.

1264
01:39:01,446 --> 01:39:03,607
- It was that close?
- No, maestro...

1265
01:39:03,782 --> 01:39:05,545
...it was closer.

1266
01:39:05,884 --> 01:39:07,408
No concentration.

1267
01:39:17,329 --> 01:39:18,557
What is it, Maria?

1268
01:39:18,730 --> 01:39:20,027
It's Father.

1269
01:39:20,465 --> 01:39:22,228
Antonio.

1270
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:24,664
- We were worried.
- I'm sorry, querida.

1271
01:39:24,836 --> 01:39:26,599
- Has Mario come home?
- Yes, of course.

1272
01:39:26,771 --> 01:39:28,432
Where is he?

1273
01:39:29,341 --> 01:39:30,865
(BOTH SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

1274
01:39:37,115 --> 01:39:38,810
Antonio.

1275
01:39:38,984 --> 01:39:40,417
You know Señor Contreras.

1276
01:39:40,952 --> 01:39:42,214
Don Antonio.

1277
01:39:43,922 --> 01:39:46,083
Señor Contreras.

1278
01:39:55,734 --> 01:39:57,326
Mario.

1279
01:39:59,571 --> 01:40:00,663
Yes, Father?

1280
01:40:00,839 --> 01:40:02,932
You fought well.

1281
01:40:03,108 --> 01:40:04,370
L...

1282
01:40:06,077 --> 01:40:09,478
- You saw me?
- Of course, why not?

1283
01:40:10,782 --> 01:40:14,149
You know, Mario,
you eXecuted the veronicas quite well.

1284
01:40:14,319 --> 01:40:16,082
Slowly, with good form.

1285
01:40:16,254 --> 01:40:17,915
Also the <i>chicuelinas.</i>

1286
01:40:18,089 --> 01:40:20,148
In fact...

1287
01:40:20,325 --> 01:40:23,158
...I have no criticism
on the way you handled the cape...

1288
01:40:23,328 --> 01:40:28,766
...but one thing
you have never learned: Concentration.

1289
01:40:28,934 --> 01:40:31,266
I'm afraid I was wrong.

1290
01:40:31,436 --> 01:40:33,631
Fighting bulls is not for him.

1291
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:38,409
Perhaps he'll have better luck
with his concentration...

1292
01:40:38,577 --> 01:40:42,013
...when he studies music
with Señor Contreras.

1293
01:40:45,450 --> 01:40:47,441
Thank you, Father, for...

1294
01:40:47,619 --> 01:40:48,677
For everything.

1295
01:40:49,721 --> 01:40:51,348
That's all right, my boy.

1296
01:40:52,257 --> 01:40:56,717
Maestro, I take back everything
I've said about you.

1297
01:40:56,895 --> 01:41:00,490
Yes, even what I was thinking about you.

1298
01:41:01,199 --> 01:41:02,325
Well...

1299
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:04,161
...Mario, Maria, dance.

1300
01:41:04,336 --> 01:41:05,803
I ordered this fiesta for you.

1301
01:41:05,971 --> 01:41:08,132
Go on, enjoy yourselves.

1302
01:41:11,643 --> 01:41:13,838
You did well, maestro.

1303
01:41:14,012 --> 01:41:15,240
Very well.

1304
01:41:15,413 --> 01:41:17,347
Well, why not?

1305
01:41:18,149 --> 01:41:20,276
(BAND PLAYING
"MEXICAN HAT DANCE")

1306
01:41:39,104 --> 01:41:42,130
If Mario was knocked down,
why is Maria limping?

1307
01:41:42,307 --> 01:41:43,535
Uh...

1308
01:41:44,075 --> 01:41:47,238
Twins, maestro, twins.

1309
01:41:52,784 --> 01:41:54,411
Chato!

1310
01:41:57,756 --> 01:41:59,553
Come back here!

1311
01:42:14,305 --> 01:42:16,296
