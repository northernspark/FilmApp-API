00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:43,609
This is the police!
Open up!

3
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,022
Police! Anyone here?

4
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,067
Hey, fella.
Anybody home?

5
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:38,063
Ma'am, turn around slowly.

6
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:50,442
Unit 507,
we got a possible homicide.

7
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,444
Requesting backup.

8
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:56,381
<i>Copy that, 507. Backup is
en route. ETA 10 minutes.</i>

9
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,551
Adrian?

10
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,619
Adrian!

11
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:15,767
Adrian.

12
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:44,763
Cobbs.

13
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,636
Cobbs!

14
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:36,748
This is Unit 507.
I've got an officer down.

15
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,450
Repeat, officer down.

16
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:42,888
<i>Copy, 507.
EMS is being notified.</i>

17
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,657
<i>Backup to your location
in five minutes.</i>

18
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,324
It's gonna be so much better
than the city, honey.

19
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:25,030
You're gonna have sidewalks
to ride your bike on and a yard.

20
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,065
You're gonna love it.

21
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:30,068
I miss Daddy.

22
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:34,106
I know, honey.

23
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:36,108
But you're gonna be
so much happier here.

24
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:38,610
I promise. You'll see.

25
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:06,938
There they are!

26
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:08,307
- Hi.
- Hi.

27
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:09,841
You must be Claire.

28
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,576
Your mommy's told me
a lot about you,

29
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,679
so I brought you something
very special from our office

30
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:14,946
Ta-da!

31
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:21,153
I'm sorry. She's still not 100%
about this whole moving thing.

32
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,823
That's all right. She will be
when she sees her new room.

33
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:27,926
Come on. Let's go inside.

34
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,799
Welcome home.

35
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:42,174
What do you think, hmm?
I mean, I know it's not perfect,

36
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:44,343
but I think with a little bit
of work, it'll be great.

37
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,678
Well, you know, there was
a lot of interest in this house,

38
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,847
mostly from
real estate speculators,

39
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:51,850
but I felt that
it needed a family.

40
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:55,120
You like it?

41
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,924
Did something happen here?

42
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,025
What?

43
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,527
Well, it's an old house.

44
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:06,131
It's got a lot of history,
but nothing too bad.

45
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,333
- There you go.
- Oh, thanks.

46
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:11,103
Those are for the front door,
the back door, and the garage.

47
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,637
I'm right in town.

48
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,573
Call me if you need
anything at all.

49
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,541
- What is this?
- That's for the keys.

50
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,210
Oh, okay.

51
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,413
You keep that.

52
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,048
Thank you.

53
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,417
Oh.

54
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:27,172
"Lilith."

55
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,212
What's that?

56
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,981
What's what?

57
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:37,182
Claire.

58
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,152
Please, Mommy, can I keep her?

59
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,755
But you have so many other dolls
already, honey.

60
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,992
But I want this one.

61
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:50,095
I think that one probably
belongs to somebody else.

62
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,130
Finders keepers.

63
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:58,203
Fine, but you have
to let me wash it first.

64
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,271
Come on.

65
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,708
All right, keep unpacking.

66
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:05,210
Okay.

67
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,723
Everything's going pretty well.

68
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:23,662
I mean, she's not
super excited, but...

69
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,597
What's going on with you?

70
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,132
<i>Same-old, same-old.
Grading papers.</i>

71
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:28,833
<i>Everything okay with the move?</i>

72
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,102
Yeah. You know what?

73
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,673
Thanks so much for helping me
with that article.

74
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,575
It's hard to imagine
there's actually people

75
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:39,878
who believe this stuff is real.

76
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:42,581
Sometimes it's easier to rely on
a supernatural explanation

77
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:45,483
rather than confronting
the truth.

78
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,652
So what are you gonna do now?

79
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,155
Well, I'm gonna talk
to some of the local papers,

80
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:52,390
but I really just want
to take some time

81
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,160
and work on my book
and focus on Claire.

82
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:56,595
<i>Good.</i>

83
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,797
It's much bigger
than our old apartment.

84
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:01,533
- Claire?
- <i>Everything okay?</i>

85
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,969
You know what? I'm gonna go.
I'll call you later?

86
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,438
Okay, honey.
Good luck with the unpacking.

87
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:09,140
Thanks.

88
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:12,777
And I have some friends for you
in one of these boxes.

89
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:17,482
Tomorrow I have to go
to a new school with new kids.

90
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,719
I'm scared.

91
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:27,459
I hope they're nice,
not mean like some kids.

92
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:30,261
What if they don't like me?

93
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:35,000
What if they don't need
any new friends?

94
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:40,972
Hey.

95
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,145
I know it's hard.

96
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:54,653
You're gonna do great.

97
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,554
I promise.

98
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:58,790
Can I sleep with the light on?

99
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:01,526
Aren't you forgetting something?

100
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,094
Mom.

101
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,229
Come on.

102
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:06,164
Okay.

103
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:09,167
Now I lay me down to sleep,

104
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:12,904
I pray the Lord
my soul to keep.

105
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:17,075
If I should die before I wake,

106
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:20,679
I pray the Lord
my soul to take.

107
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:29,020
- 3 times 3?
- Nine.

108
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,356
- 3 times 4?
- 12.

109
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:33,892
- 3 times 5?
- 15.

110
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:37,328
3 times 6?

111
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,464
Claire?

112
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,700
Are you paying attention?

113
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:44,302
18.

114
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,304
Very good.

115
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,873
- 3 times 7?
- 21.

116
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,144
Hey, did you really move
into the bad house?

117
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,979
I heard it's haunted.

118
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,581
Stop it.

119
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,817
You moved into the bad house?

120
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,652
Stop it.

121
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,853
It's gonna get you.

122
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:06,958
♪ It's gonna get you ♪

123
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,993
- ♪ It's gonna get you ♪
- Hey!

124
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,396
Stop it!

125
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:53,872
Hello?

126
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:04,916
Hello?

127
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,590
Oh, my God!

128
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:14,926
- The door was open.
- Can I help you?

129
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,162
I'm Janine, your new neighbor.

130
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:18,963
Alyson.

131
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:21,866
I thought this place
was gonna... Oh!

132
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,468
Whoops!

133
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:30,675
They kept
all the original fixtures.

134
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,646
It's lovely.

135
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:37,048
Oh, where are my manners?

136
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,283
Sorry they're a bit smushed,

137
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,518
but my cats were
walking on them.

138
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:43,354
Thank you.

139
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:45,456
Oh, look.
There's one of them now.

140
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:48,960
Smokey!

141
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:52,897
He's my oldest.

142
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,900
You have a little girl.

143
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:58,369
Yeah. Claire. She's nine.

144
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:01,673
My cats simply adore children.

145
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,474
Oh, that's great.

146
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,113
So if Claire ever wants to come
and play with the kitties,

147
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,548
just send her over.

148
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,317
They would love it.

149
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:15,320
And if you need anything,
just holler.

150
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:17,422
- Okay, thank you.
- Bye!

151
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,224
It's nice to meet you.

152
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,131
Wow.

153
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,874
Mommy said
it would be better here,

154
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:37,809
that I'd be happy.

155
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,044
She promised.

156
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:41,779
I thought things
would be different,

157
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:44,782
that people would be nicer.

158
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,151
But they're not.

159
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,387
They pick on me.

160
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:52,357
I hate them.

161
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:55,393
I wish they were dead.

162
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:34,232
- I won't go back there!
- Claire, you have to!

163
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,500
- Stop it.
- No.

164
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,101
- Yes.
- I want to go home.

165
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:38,603
- We are home.
- No!

166
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,004
You don't scream at me.

167
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,005
No!

168
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:43,875

171
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,161

hear me calling your name?

176
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:20,478

Sluggo!

00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,358
Smokey!

184

No! No! No! No!

186
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:43,628
No! No, no, no, no!

187
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:53,838
Separation and divorce can be
very stressful for a child.

188
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,341
An entire support system's
been torn out from under her.

189
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:05,316
The future suddenly appears
very uncertain.

190
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:09,087
The hardest thing is that you're
having to go through this alone.

191
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:13,491
I just... I don't know what
I'm supposed to do anymore.

192
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:17,862
I mean, she won't go to school,
and she'll barely eat anything.

193
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,364
Her father still lives
in the city?

194
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,500
Yeah.

195
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:25,136
Returning to the dynamics
of that environment

196
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:27,138
might be a helpful thing
for her,

197
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:31,109
even just for a visit.

198
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:35,480
I'd strongly consider
letting her go back.

199
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:39,684
Thank you for your time, Doctor.

200
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:50,495
The subject exhibits traits
I've seen in similar cases

201
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:53,164
of callous,
unemotional children.

202
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:58,069
Distinctive lack of remorse
and empathy.

203
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:02,974
Further study will be required

204
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:06,611
before I can determine
the presence of psychopathy.

205
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:19,423
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

206
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:31,169
You're not even gonna touch
your ice cream?

207
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:39,143
Fine. Then I will.

208
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:42,346
I wanna go home.

209
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,484
Honey, this is our home now.

210
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:50,688
Why? 'Cause you and Daddy
can't get along?

211
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,890
It's a lot more complicated
than that, sweetie.

212
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,226
It's your fault.

213
00:19:57,829 --> 00:19:59,597
Claire...

214
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:02,233
You're always so busy
with your stupid writing.

215
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,735
No wonder he hates you.

216
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,841
I'm gonna go take care
of the check.

217
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,815
What have you got there?

218
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,850
Give her back.

219
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:22,086
A pretty girl like you
should have a nice, new doll,

220
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,021
not an ugly, old one
like this.

221
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,090
- She's not ugly.
- Well, look at her.

222
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:27,592
She's practically falling apart.

223
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,227
I tell you what.

224
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,529
I bet I have a new one
in the back room.

225
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:32,997
Why don't we throw this one
away, and I'll go get her?

226
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,066
Give her back!

227
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:36,534
Claire!

228
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:39,203
I am so sorry.

229
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:43,541
What is wrong... Claire!

230
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:44,742
I'm sorry.

231
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,952
I think we should
talk about this, don't you?

232
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:58,823
She's a murderer!

233
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,792
- What are you talking about?
- Your daughter!

234
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,394
I don't... What?

235
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:06,397
A child trampled through
my garden last night.

236
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:07,965
Janine...

237
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:10,067
I saw the way
she looked at them.

238
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:13,137
My babies wouldn't hurt anybody,
and now they're dead,

239
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,805
and she killed them!

240
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,874
Okay, well, I'm sorry,
but I can assure you

241
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,177
that my daughter had absolutely
nothing to do with your cats.

242
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:22,146
Excuse me.

243
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,934
Good night, Rose.

244
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:45,069
Good night, Hank.

245
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,780
Someone there?

246
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:37,748
- Hey, Daddy.
- It's Daddy's little girl.

247
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:40,317
Oh, my God, I've missed you.

248
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:43,320
Bedtime is at 8:30
and no sugar after 6:00.

249
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:46,090
Yeah, I know.
I've done this before.

250
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:47,758
Just keep an eye on her, okay?

251
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:49,660
Ready to go, sweetheart?

252
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:55,566
Okay, you keep warm, all right?

253
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:03,474
I love you.

254
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:12,116
Well, that's a nice house.
How much did you put down?

255
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:13,951
Don't.

256
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:16,320
I bet you could get some
good money if you flipped it.

257
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:18,522
Jonathan, please.

258
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,325
There's a unit that opened up
two floors down from me.

259
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:24,528
Earl even said
he'd waive the deposit.

260
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:28,032
Look, just take care of her,
okay?

261
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:29,667
Okay.

262
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,293
Looks like there's a leak
in one of your fittings.

263
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:58,262
There's something else.

264
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:05,803
- What's that?
- You know these people?

265
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:08,272
No.

266
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,108
No, they must be the people
that used to live here.

267
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,977
That looks like
a muñeca quitapena.

268
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:14,411
A what?

269
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:16,380
Muñeca quitapena.
The doll.

270
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:18,415
You don't see them here
in the States much.

271
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:20,751
They're not usually that big.

272
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:22,720
My daughter actually
found this in the house.

273
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:24,555
She's gotten
pretty attached to it.

274
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:27,124
Bad luck to find
someone else's muñeca.

275
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:03,928
"Local family found slain."

276
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:41,732
Zachary, this nice lady is gonna
ask you some questions, okay?

277
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:45,869
Hi.

278
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,805
I'll be right outside.

279
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:03,854
Do you mind if I sit down?

280
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:22,606
I'm Alyson Simon.

281
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:26,944
I recently moved into
your old house.

282
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:33,117
And I have a little girl
who's nine,

283
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:37,388
just about the same age you were
when you lived there.

284
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:42,960
She found your doll.

285
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:49,533
Do you remember your doll?

286
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,618
She's grown
really attached to it.

287
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:14,591
Can you tell me why you did it,
Zachary?

288
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:17,361
Why'd you kill your family?

289
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,430
Was it...

290
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:23,200
Was it the house?

291
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:26,904
Was it something in the house?

292
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:33,143
Zachary.

293
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:35,512
Zachary!

294
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,815
It's time to go.

295
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,516
No, I just need one more minute.

296
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:42,086
He's not gonna tell you
anything.

297
00:28:57,702 --> 00:29:03,240

299
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:09,546

- Ma'am?

300
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:11,381
Where did you hear that song?

301
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:13,550
Tell me where you heard
that song!

302
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:25,763
The kid killed his whole family
and two cops in my house!

303
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:29,032
We found his picture
under my daughter's floor!

304
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,269
Mrs. Simon, the state civil code
is very clear.

305
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:35,405
A death in the home
is only a material defect

306
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:37,775
if it occurs within
three years of the sale.

307
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:39,777
Material defect?
This isn't a cracked shingle.

308
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:41,512
It's a multiple homicide!

309
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:43,113
What do you want me to do?

310
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:44,882
<i>Tell the bank
that you misrepresented</i>

311
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,351
the condition of the property
and get me my damn money back.

312
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:50,654
There's no cooling-off period.
This is a done deal.

313
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:52,856
Then list it. You said there was
a lot of competition.

314
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:55,659
Sell it to one of the others.

315
00:29:55,727 --> 00:30:00,564
<i>Yeah, well, um...</i>

316
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,567
- There was no one else.
- <i>Listen...</i>

317
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,870
I'm gonna be honest with you.
With the history of this house,

318
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:10,440
selling it is not gonna be easy,
believe me.

319
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:13,076
No. You know what?
I'm calling my lawyer.

320
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,846
<i>There's no reason to get...</i>

321
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:17,214
Damn it.

322
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,328
<i>You knew this would happen.</i>

323
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:33,397
You were my friend.

324
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:36,867
<i>And I always will be.</i>

325
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,335
Why?

326
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:41,872
<i>It's her turn.
She needs me.</i>

327
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,376
<i>You understand, don't you?</i>

328
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:48,545
<i>Why you have to go?</i>

329
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:50,380
I'm scared.

330
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:53,617
<i>Don't be. You're going
to be happy again.</i>

331
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,352
<i>You're going to be free.</i>

332
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,522
<i>You can play forever.</i>

333
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,490
With you?

334
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:02,759
<i>Come find us, Zachary.</i>

335
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,268
<i>Come find us, Zachary.</i>

336
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:14,805
<i>We'll be waiting.</i>

337
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,921
You know,
sometimes your mother and I,

338
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:35,025
we act like mean children
on a schoolyard.

339
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:38,362
We say things to each other
that we don't really mean,

340
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:43,233
and you have to listen to it,
and it's not fair.

341
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:47,938
But both of us want you to know
that we love you

342
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:49,740
more than you can ever imagine.

343
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:51,675
Well, what about Mommy?

344
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,443
What about Mommy?

345
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:56,313
Do you love her?

346
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,782
I do.

347
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:02,853
Well, I just don't understand
why we can't live together

348
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,422
and things can be
like they used to.

349
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:08,992
Okay.

350
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:14,498
Because sometimes
people who love each other

351
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:17,034
need a little time apart

352
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:20,070
to remember why they loved
each other in the first place.

353
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:23,874
But I promise you
I'm working on it.

354
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,676
No, you're lying.

355
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:28,278
No, sweetie.

356
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:29,880
Yeah, you don't love her.

357
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:33,317
- Yes, I do.
- You don't love me either.

358
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:35,152
Claire...

359
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:36,620
And I don't love you.

360
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,216
Why doesn't anyone listen?

361
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:09,920
We don't want a new mommy.
We want our mommy to come back

362
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:16,026
so that things can be
like it used to be.

363
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:19,396
You're the only one
that listens to me.

364
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:38,949
I will never stop
loving you, ever.

365
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,517
I promise.

366
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:43,053
Cross your heart?

367
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:44,454
Cross my heart.

368
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,123
Hope to die?

369
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:51,361
Come on, let's go home.

370
00:33:57,835 --> 00:33:59,836
Your favorite pizza.

371
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:02,773
Here you go.

372
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,343
And...

373
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:08,945
some funny movies
to make you laugh.

374
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:21,925
Thought I'd come by
and surprise you.

375
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:24,995
No, no, no, I told you that
tonight is not a good night.

376
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,230
Is she here?
Can I meet her?

377
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,468
Oh.

378
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:34,404
She is just adorable.

379
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:41,211
Who are you?

380
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:46,149
My name is Kathy.
I'm a friend of your father's.

381
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:48,718
He never talks about you.

382
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:55,258
- Kathy's a friend from work.
- Yeah.

383
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:58,261
So what grade are you in,
Claire?

384
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:00,997
Sweetheart,
someone asked you a question.

385
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:04,267
- So?
- So why don't you answer her?

386
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:06,303
- I don't want to.
- Jonathan...

387
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,405
Claire's in third grade.

388
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:12,375
Well, your father told me
that you like dolls.

389
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,244
I brought you one.

390
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:18,115
Isn't that nice?

391
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,384
What do you say?

392
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,385
It's ugly.

393
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:25,422
No, it's not ugly.

394
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:28,158
Yes, it is. It's ugly.
I don't want it.

395
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:31,761
It's okay. I'm sure she'll
open up when she's ready.

396
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:35,365
But until then, maybe she can
play with Sally, huh?

397
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:38,869
Hey! That's crossing the line.
You pick that up right now.

398
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:40,871
- It's just a little thing.
- Claire, now!

399
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,984
That didn't go
as well as I expected.

400
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:58,989
She just moved to Monterey,
and she left all of her friends,

401
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:00,957
she's in a new school,

402
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:02,826
and the separation
between Alyson and me

403
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:05,428
is really hard on her.

404
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:08,698
- I didn't mean to...
- Kathy...

405
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:11,568
I told you that I needed to be
alone with my daughter tonight.

406
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:15,672
I'm sorry. I just...

407
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,307
I wanted to be with you.

408
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:31,021
Tell you what.
I could use a drink.

409
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:33,490
Why don't you let me
finish up these dishes?

410
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:36,393
You go down the corner
and get us a bottle of wine.

411
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,295
I really don't think
that's a good idea.

412
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:39,963
Oh, come on.

413
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:43,833
You really don't take no
for an answer, do you?

414
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:46,536
Listen, you deserve
a chance to relax.

415
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,472
Okay.

416
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,008
And I'm gonna get some
chocolate chip ice cream

417
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:53,310
because that's
Claire's favorite.

418
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,612
- I'll be right back.
- Sure.

419
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:37,053
<i>♪ One quiet night ♪</i>

420
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:39,756
<i>♪ I've been waiting
oh, so long ♪</i>

421
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:45,262
Claire?

422
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:50,834
Claire, is that you?

423
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:18,962
Jon?

424
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,434
Jon, is that you?

425
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:40,877
911, help me.

426
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:43,146
<i>- 911. What's your emergency?</i>
- Oh, my God.

427
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,383
<i>What's your emergency, ma'am?</i>

428
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,418
<i>Ma'am?</i>

429
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:50,153
<i>Do you need
medical assistance?</i>

430
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,489
- They're here.
- <i>Ma'am, are you there?</i>

431
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,191
<i>Ma'am?</i>

432
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:35,398
- Hi.
- Hey.

433
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:40,970
Do they know what happened?

434
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:44,040
Said it looks like
someone broke in.

435
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,109
Signs of a struggle.

436
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,479
I was gone 10 minutes.

437
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,717
Were you guys serious?

438
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,486
No.

439
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:58,288
She was just a friend
from work,

440
00:40:58,355 --> 00:41:00,957
but we've gone out
a couple of times.

441
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:02,692
That's it.

442
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,828
Why don't you come back with us?

443
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:07,464
I gotta stay here
and deal with the police.

444
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:09,466
- You sure?
- Yeah.

445
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:10,834
Why don't you and Claire
go back?

446
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:12,569
I don't want you
anywhere around this.

447
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:16,406
Okay. Call us
if you hear anything.

448
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:19,175
Thanks.

449
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:21,511
Come on, honey,
let's go get your stuff.

450
00:44:34,638 --> 00:44:36,205
Oh, God.

451
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,046
Oh, my God!

452
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:27,790
<i>You've reached Ken Stevens.
Please leave a message.</i>

453
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:31,527
Hi, this is Alyson Simon.

454
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:34,797
I was just calling to see
if you had put any more thought

455
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:37,366
into the house situation.

456
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:39,435
Could you give me a call back,
please?

457
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:57,954
Ms. Simon?
It's Ken Stevens.

458
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:20,009
Ms. Simon?

459
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:21,144
It's Ken.

460
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:26,082
I wanted to come by and clear
the air a little bit, Ms. Simon.

461
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:28,818
I thought, uh...

462
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:31,621
I thought we could talk about
the house's history.

463
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:36,993
Claire?

464
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,463
Is that you, honey?

465
00:46:57,414 --> 00:46:58,414
<i>Okay, yeah.
You know what?</i>

466
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,249
<i>What do you want me to say?</i>

467
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:02,552
<i>You want me to say I made
a mistake? Fine, I did.</i>

468
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:06,322
<i>I made a mistake. You know,
I didn't call you to argue.</i>

469
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,791
We gotta figure out what we're
gonna do about our daughter.

470
00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:12,628
The therapy isn't working and
I don't know what else to do.

471
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:15,464
When she came over, she had this
spooky-looking doll with her.

472
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:17,466
Yeah, and she won't
go anywhere without it.

473
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:20,469
<i>She happened to mention that
Kathy brought her a new one?</i>

474
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:22,471
What do you mean?

475
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:24,841
<i>She brought her a new doll.</i>

476
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:26,909
<i>I found it underneath her bed
torn apart.</i>

477
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:30,246
<i>I'm talking violently.</i>

478
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:32,181
- <i>Wow.</i>
- I know it's just a doll,

479
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:34,617
but I can't help but think
it might better if it were gone.

480
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:10,820
I'll be right back.

481
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:31,440
Lily?

482
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,386
Lily?

483
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:05,041
Where's Lily?

484
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,542
Oh, God, honey, you scared me.

485
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,077
Where is she?!

486
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:11,414
Claire!

487
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:14,583
Where is she?

488
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:16,919
Come on, honey.
Claire, it is too late.

489
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:18,587
Put it... Claire!

490
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:21,791
- Claire!
- Where's Lily?

491
00:49:21,858 --> 00:49:23,793
- Stop it!
- How could you do that to her?

492
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:26,662
She was my friend!
My only friend!

493
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:28,864
Stop it!

494
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:32,268
She did not belong to you!
She belonged to someone else.

495
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:36,205
- Ow.
- What? What?

496
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:38,107
Oh, my God.

497
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:41,444
Oh, my God. Claire, honey,
where is this from?

498
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:42,912
Who did this to you?

499
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,246
I don't know!

500
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:46,949
Claire!

501
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,800
No!

502
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:41,223
- Good morning.
- Hi.

503
00:52:46,363 --> 00:52:47,930
Are they real?

504
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:50,432
You come on in,
I'll tell you all about them.

505
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:54,336
See you in a bit.

506
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:56,539
How many of you have
ever heard the expression

507
00:52:56,606 --> 00:52:58,307
"giving someone
the evil eye?"

508
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:01,310
One of the best known and
perhaps the most frightening

509
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:04,079
Latin American superstitions
is called Mal de Ojo.

510
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:06,415
Ophelia?

511
00:53:06,483 --> 00:53:09,552
The belief is that the evil
spirit can direct bad luck

512
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:13,422
or even injury at someone with
nothing more than a simple look.

513
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:16,425
Children, particularly the ones
that are not baptized,

514
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:18,861
are believed to be more
susceptible to this curse.

515
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:20,696
Next.

516
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:22,765
Oftentimes in Central America,

517
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:24,533
you'll see children wearing
something red

518
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:27,703
or even having a simple red
thread tied around the wrist

519
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:29,872
to ward off Mal de Ojo.

520
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,575
Lights, please.

521
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:35,945
Okay, well, finish the readings
on superstition for next time.

522
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:39,748
Alyson, hi.

523
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:42,818
I'm sorry to hear things
aren't going well with the move.

524
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:44,720
- Oh, yeah.
- Did you bring it?

525
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:47,189
I did.

526
00:53:47,257 --> 00:53:48,791
And it's from Guatemala?

527
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:52,161
- Tecal.
- Hmm. It's a worry doll.

528
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,129
Some people believe that when
a child has trouble sleeping,

529
00:53:54,197 --> 00:53:56,332
it's because a large amount
of stress has built up,

530
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:57,933
but a worry doll
worries in the child's place

531
00:53:58,001 --> 00:53:59,368
so the child sleeps better.

532
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:00,669
Does it work?

533
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:03,072
Sometimes, but the question is

534
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:05,374
does it work because
the doll has magical powers,

535
00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:07,876
or because the child
believes it does?

536
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:10,946
Okay, assuming
that it does work,

537
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:15,384
and this doll can transfer
the child's worries to itself,

538
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:18,754
could it work
the other way around?

539
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:23,025
I mean, could the doll transfer
something to the child?

540
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,526
Look, Alyson, if your
daughter's having issues,

541
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:25,794
I'm really not the right person.

542
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:27,563
Okay, just look at something.

543
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:29,498
This happened the other night.

544
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:31,800
I picked it up.
I was trying to get rid of it,

545
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:36,105
and now Claire has a bruise in
the exact same place on her arm.

546
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:38,674
- It's not a voodoo doll.
- I know it's not.

547
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:42,511
But I took this doll that night
and put it in a Dumpster,

548
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:44,413
and the very next morning,
it was back.

549
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:45,814
This doll.

550
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:47,416
Yeah.

551
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:50,853
Can you help me?

552
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,155
Yeah.
If you don't mind leaving it,

553
00:54:53,223 --> 00:54:54,923
I can take a closer look at it
for you.

554
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:57,026
You can keep it
as long as you like.

555
00:54:57,093 --> 00:54:59,595
I want this doll as far away
from my daughter as possible.

556
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:01,330
Okay.

557
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:02,598
Thanks.

558
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:09,938
I want you to realize

559
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:15,511
that as a professional who
works regularly with children,

560
00:55:15,578 --> 00:55:18,314
I have a responsibility
to report...

561
00:55:18,381 --> 00:55:22,484
suspicious behavior...

562
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:26,322
to the authorities.

563
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:30,859
What... What do you mean,
um, suspicious behavior?

564
00:55:32,228 --> 00:55:35,364
Tell me about her arm.

565
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:41,337
Wait a minute. Are you...
Is that what this is about?

566
00:55:41,404 --> 00:55:43,706
Are you...

567
00:55:43,773 --> 00:55:47,676
Are you accusing me
of abusing my daughter?

568
00:55:47,744 --> 00:55:51,547
I'm giving you a chance
to explain it.

569
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:55,017
What? Are you...

570
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:57,119
Of course not!

571
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:58,921
Absolutely not!

572
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:01,290
Come sit down for a second.

573
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:11,033
It's very important
that you help me understand

574
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:12,901
how this happened.

575
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:15,304
Understand what?

576
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,806
She's a kid. Kids play hard.
Why don't you ask her?

577
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:20,776
I did. She told me
that you grabbed her.

578
00:56:20,844 --> 00:56:23,712
- You lost your temper.
- I don't believe it.

579
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,614
That's crazy.

580
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:29,284
I mean, that's crazy.
Why would she tell you that?

581
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:31,120
Do you lose your temper?

582
00:56:31,187 --> 00:56:33,021
No, I don't lose my temper!

583
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:34,656
You're raising your voice
right now.

584
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,892
Yeah, because you're making
ridiculous accusations!

585
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,262
You're saying
I'm abusing my daughter.

586
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:42,364
It's difficult
to be a single mom,

587
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:46,201
and I can't imagine how much
stress you must be under.

588
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:47,870
Don't you dare make this
about that.

589
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,842
We'll give this one more chance,
all right?

590
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:56,612
But if I see as much as
one bruise...

591
00:56:56,679 --> 00:57:00,315
or one scrape,

592
00:57:00,383 --> 00:57:03,552
I'll call protective services,
am I clear?

593
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:07,489
Yeah.

594
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:30,012
Jon, I feel like
I'm losing her,

595
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:31,880
and I don't know
what else to do.

596
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:34,650
<i>That's it.
I'll see you in a couple hours.</i>

597
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:36,819
No, I can't ask you to do that.

598
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:39,655
<i>You're not doing this alone
anymore, Alyson.</i>

599
00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:41,657
<i>I'll see you by 10:00.</i>

600
00:57:41,724 --> 00:57:43,425
Okay, thank you.

601
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:46,428
- Hey.
- Oh!

602
00:57:48,331 --> 00:57:49,698
You scared me.

603
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:52,034
Where's Lily?

604
00:57:52,101 --> 00:57:56,071
Why don't I take you to the
store and buy you a new doll?

605
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:58,440
I don't want a new doll.

606
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:02,344
I want Lily!

607
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:04,980
Claire!

608
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:09,718
Why do you always hurt me,
Mommy? Why?

609
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:11,687
Oh, my God.

610
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:20,295
Okay, let's see what we got.

611
00:58:20,363 --> 00:58:21,930
Ophelia?

612
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:23,732
Would you like me to start
with the abdomen?

613
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,601
Sounds good.

614
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:04,773
Want me to check it out?

615
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:08,310
No, no, I'll go.
Call maintenance and stay here.

616
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:41,376
Hmm. Strange.

617
00:59:42,812 --> 00:59:45,213
Hello?

618
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:47,349
Is there someone there?

619
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:21,049
We need to get out of here.

620
01:00:24,187 --> 01:00:25,520
Ophelia?

621
01:00:29,425 --> 01:00:30,726
Ophelia?

622
01:00:56,085 --> 01:00:57,886
There's Daddy's little princess.

623
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:01,123
I know what you want.

624
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:04,359
Daddy's world-famous...

625
01:01:04,427 --> 01:01:06,094
flapjacks.

626
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:13,268
- Morning.
- Morning.

627
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:15,904
Breakfast is almost ready.
Can you get the juice?

628
01:01:15,972 --> 01:01:16,972
Yeah, sure.

629
01:01:23,112 --> 01:01:24,646
<i>The campus
has been on lockdown,</i>

630
01:01:24,714 --> 01:01:26,448
<i>as officers question anybody...</i>

631
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:27,683
- Here you go, sweetie.
- <i>who might have information</i>

632
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,451
<i>helpful to this case.</i>

633
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,153
<i>The classroom
where the student was found</i>

634
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:33,055
<i>belonged to Latin American
studies professor</i>

635
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:34,089
<i>Elena Carranza.</i>

636
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:36,224
Oh, my God.

637
01:01:36,292 --> 01:01:37,225
What?

638
01:01:37,293 --> 01:01:39,327
What, you knew her?

639
01:01:39,395 --> 01:01:41,029
She's the one I gave it to.

640
01:01:41,097 --> 01:01:42,998
<i>The professor was not
at her apartment.</i>

641
01:01:43,066 --> 01:01:44,533
<i>Efforts to reach her by phone
have failed.</i>

642
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,234
<i>Her colleagues and students</i>

643
01:01:46,302 --> 01:01:48,704
<i>are among those being
questioned this hour...</i>

644
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:49,771
I gotta go.

645
01:01:52,842 --> 01:01:55,577
<i>- Bill, back to you.
- Thanks, Valerie.</i>

646
01:01:55,645 --> 01:01:58,980
<i>More from this breaking story
later in our broadcast.</i>

647
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:04,586
<i>Did your mother
do that to you?</i>

648
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:06,221
<i>Hurt your arm?</i>

649
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:10,492
<i>Yes.</i>

650
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,328
<i>How, Claire?</i>

651
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:15,397
<i>How did she hurt you?</i>

652
01:02:17,834 --> 01:02:20,435
<i>I was in the kitchen,</i>

653
01:02:20,503 --> 01:02:23,839
<i>and I spilled my milk,</i>

654
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:27,142
<i>and she just...
she just finished cleaning up,</i>

655
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:28,510
<i>and...</i>

656
01:02:31,013 --> 01:02:32,748
<i>and she got mad.</i>

657
01:02:34,884 --> 01:02:38,320
<i>Claire, I'm going to go
and get a special report</i>

658
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:40,655
<i>so I can write this down.</i>

659
01:03:06,015 --> 01:03:07,916
I'm in the middle of something.

660
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:11,453
I know, but someone left this
in the front door.

661
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:14,689
It's the Simon girl's doll,
isn't it?

662
01:03:14,757 --> 01:03:16,558
- Who left it?
- Don't know.

663
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:19,261
I went to put the mail out,
and it was just sitting there.

664
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:24,299
Just keep it up front
for me, okay?

665
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:25,333
Sure.

666
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:26,868
And there's another thing.

667
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:28,770
It's about Zachary Orcutt.

668
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:42,150
That's a lot of blood.

669
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:43,652
Yeah, looks like our victim
was killed up here,

670
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:45,887
then dragged down to the desk.

671
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:50,192
Can I help you?

672
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:51,760
Yeah, I'm sorry,

673
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:54,029
but Professor Carranza
was a friend of mine,

674
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:57,699
and I'm wondering
if anyone has found a doll.

675
01:03:57,767 --> 01:03:59,501
A doll?

676
01:03:59,569 --> 01:04:01,536
Yeah, I came by, I dropped it
off with her yesterday.

677
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:02,704
She was looking into
something for me.

678
01:04:02,772 --> 01:04:04,773
I'm gonna need you to leave.

679
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:07,008
There's a detective outside
that'll take your statement.

680
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:09,344
Danny, can you please
escort this woman out?

681
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:12,013
Okay, but it's really important
that you find this doll.

682
01:04:12,081 --> 01:04:13,782
- I need you to come with me.
- Yeah, but...

683
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,984
- Get her out of here.
- Yeah, okay, I'm...

684
01:04:16,052 --> 01:04:17,652
Right this way.

685
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,321
Sorry.

686
01:04:19,388 --> 01:04:23,024
Anyway, they dragged her
from here to there.

687
01:04:23,092 --> 01:04:24,192
Right.
And down the steps.

688
01:04:27,096 --> 01:04:28,630
Hello?

689
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:30,298
I really need to talk to you
about Claire.

690
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:32,167
How soon can you get here?

691
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:36,404
Halfway to the city is gonna
be like another hour or two.

692
01:04:36,472 --> 01:04:39,107
I know you went to see
Zachary Orcutt.

693
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:42,444
<i>You know I evaluated him
for the court five years ago</i>

694
01:04:42,511 --> 01:04:44,512
<i>after he murdered his family.</i>

695
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:46,248
Okay. Why are you
telling me this?

696
01:04:46,315 --> 01:04:48,683
Shortly after
you spoke with him,

697
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:51,152
Zachary Orcutt
disappeared from his ward

698
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,688
<i>and hasn't been seen since.</i>

699
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:59,728
Are you telling me
that Claire is in danger?

700
01:04:59,795 --> 01:05:01,963
<i>Just get here
as soon as you can.</i>

701
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:07,035
Jane, I need you to
reschedule my next...

702
01:05:52,348 --> 01:05:53,848
Claire?

703
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:01,022
Claire.

704
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:08,763
Sweetheart?

705
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:13,735
Sweetheart!

706
01:06:15,738 --> 01:06:16,738
Daddy?

707
01:06:19,008 --> 01:06:20,642
Just checking.

708
01:06:50,606 --> 01:06:51,940
Claire?

709
01:06:55,811 --> 01:06:56,811
Sweetheart?

710
01:07:00,149 --> 01:07:02,417
Claire, open the door!

711
01:07:05,154 --> 01:07:06,187
Claire!

712
01:07:18,934 --> 01:07:20,268
Claire!

713
01:07:27,143 --> 01:07:28,309
Hello?

714
01:07:32,982 --> 01:07:34,649
Hello!

715
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:35,717
Claire?

716
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:38,686
Sweetheart?

717
01:07:45,194 --> 01:07:46,961
Claire!

718
01:07:47,029 --> 01:07:48,329
Anybody here?

719
01:08:18,494 --> 01:08:20,028
Oh, my God!

720
01:08:27,203 --> 01:08:28,603
Claire?

721
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:32,574
Claire!

722
01:08:32,641 --> 01:08:35,009
Claire, you open this door
right now.

723
01:08:35,077 --> 01:08:36,811
Do you hear me?

724
01:08:36,879 --> 01:08:40,181
Claire, Daddy says
open this door right now!

725
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:03,371
Sweetheart?

726
01:09:28,097 --> 01:09:30,798
There's something else in here.

727
01:09:30,866 --> 01:09:33,368
Claire, give me the doll,
sweetie.

728
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:34,969
No.

729
01:09:35,037 --> 01:09:37,605
- Claire.
- That's it.

730
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:40,175
No!

731
01:09:40,242 --> 01:09:41,676
Daddy!

732
01:09:41,744 --> 01:09:45,113
Jonathan!
Stop it, stop it!

733
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:47,882
They're connected!

734
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:49,517
Look.

735
01:09:54,890 --> 01:10:00,562
♪ Don't do you look
as the hearse goes by ♪

736
01:10:00,629 --> 01:10:04,699
- Where'd it go?
- Where is it? Where is she?

737
01:10:04,767 --> 01:10:06,367
Where is it?

738
01:10:09,605 --> 01:10:11,973
It's downstairs.
Stay here. Stay here!

739
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:15,977
I'd run if I were you.

740
01:10:19,582 --> 01:10:21,115
Claire?

741
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:25,820
Claire!

742
01:11:09,698 --> 01:11:11,833
Claire! Oh, my God.

743
01:11:20,509 --> 01:11:22,043
No sign of it.

744
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,946
We're going now!

745
01:11:25,014 --> 01:11:27,115
Don't just stand there.
Move. Move!

746
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:39,894
It's a prayer.
It's not getting out anymore.

747
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:42,897
- No! No!
- Claire!

748
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:44,666
You've got to get her
out of here!

749
01:11:44,733 --> 01:11:47,335
Let me go! Let me go!

750
01:11:47,403 --> 01:11:50,305
- Where are we going?
- Anywhere! Far from here!

751
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:57,145
How's she doing?

752
01:11:57,212 --> 01:12:00,548
Fever still hasn't broken.

753
01:12:00,616 --> 01:12:02,417
- May I see her?
- Yeah.

754
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:10,425
You were right.

755
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:12,827
There's a strong connection
between Claire and the doll.

756
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:15,396
Exactly what kind of connection
are we talking about here?

757
01:12:15,464 --> 01:12:17,632
There are three stages.

758
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:20,568
The first stage, the doll
and the subject are introduced.

759
01:12:20,636 --> 01:12:22,236
In the second stage,

760
01:12:22,304 --> 01:12:24,439
the doll actually gets
into the host's mind.

761
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:26,941
It influences
his or her thoughts,

762
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:29,610
starts to change
the way they behave.

763
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:33,181
And the third and final stage,
the doll and the host will meld.

764
01:12:33,248 --> 01:12:34,782
They'll become one.

765
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:37,218
- Are we too late?
- I don't think so.

766
01:12:37,286 --> 01:12:39,153
But I don't think
we have much time either.

767
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:41,189
Well, how about
if we get her to a doctor?

768
01:12:41,256 --> 01:12:43,191
There's gotta be someone
who could do something.

769
01:12:43,258 --> 01:12:46,127
It's very important that we
handle this in a specific way.

770
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:47,962
So it is possible
to break the bond.

771
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:50,365
I don't know. I thought if we
got your daughter far away

772
01:12:50,432 --> 01:12:51,766
that it would free her,
but I was wrong.

773
01:12:51,834 --> 01:12:53,434
The doll still has
a hold on her.

774
01:12:53,502 --> 01:12:55,236
Then I'll destroy it.

775
01:12:55,304 --> 01:12:57,705
I'll go back to the house,
and I'll destroy it.

776
01:12:57,773 --> 01:12:59,374
Jonathan...

777
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:02,377
This time of night,
I can be there in two hours.

778
01:13:02,444 --> 01:13:03,811
You can't. You can't!

779
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:05,680
- Do you have any children?
- No.

780
01:13:05,748 --> 01:13:07,548
Then you couldn't possibly know
what it's like to sit there

781
01:13:07,616 --> 01:13:10,318
and watch your daughter suffer
and do nothing about it.

782
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:12,854
You're right, I can't,
but what I do know

783
01:13:12,921 --> 01:13:14,889
is that if you don't dispose
of this doll properly,

784
01:13:14,957 --> 01:13:18,092
whatever happens to that doll
will happen to your daughter.

785
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:20,528
If the doll dies,
Claire dies.

786
01:13:20,596 --> 01:13:22,630
What is it that we need to do?
What is the proper way?

787
01:13:22,698 --> 01:13:24,532
You have to remove
the eyes first.

788
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,434
If you remove the eyes
from the doll,

789
01:13:26,502 --> 01:13:28,102
the connection with Claire
should be severed.

790
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:29,871
What do you mean, should?

791
01:13:29,938 --> 01:13:33,307
How many times do you think
I've done this?

792
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:36,744
Okay, then that's what we'll do.

793
01:13:36,812 --> 01:13:39,781
And when were done, I'm gonna
burn the frickin' thing.

794
01:13:39,848 --> 01:13:41,582
No!

795
01:13:45,788 --> 01:13:48,523
- Come here, Claire.
- Jonathan, be careful.

796
01:13:51,493 --> 01:13:53,928
- What?
- Don't let her have it!

797
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:55,696
You let her live!

798
01:14:00,068 --> 01:14:01,068
Jonathan!

799
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:04,605
Oh, my God.
Where is she?

800
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:11,512
She's outside.

801
01:14:14,249 --> 01:14:15,383
Claire!

802
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:20,388
- Claire!
- Where is she?

803
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:25,426
- I'll check over here.
- Okay. We'll go this way.

804
01:14:25,494 --> 01:14:27,128
Claire!

805
01:14:33,435 --> 01:14:34,735
Claire?

806
01:14:47,082 --> 01:14:49,717
Stop! Claire, stop!

807
01:14:55,224 --> 01:14:57,158
Elena!

808
01:15:20,816 --> 01:15:22,250
Elena!

809
01:15:22,317 --> 01:15:23,584
Oh, my God.

810
01:15:24,753 --> 01:15:26,153
Get the tarp!

811
01:15:43,639 --> 01:15:44,739
Okay.

812
01:15:44,806 --> 01:15:45,840
Claire.

813
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,915
Elena.

814
01:15:53,982 --> 01:15:55,550
Elena?

815
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:22,843
We're gonna be okay.

816
01:16:37,926 --> 01:16:39,193
Hold on!

817
01:16:55,644 --> 01:16:57,511
Everybody okay?

818
01:17:24,573 --> 01:17:26,574
We have to find it.

819
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:29,243
- I'll go get it.
- You're not getting anything!

820
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:31,012
- Claire.
- Claire!

821
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:55,569
Claire.

822
01:17:58,140 --> 01:17:59,440
Claire.

823
01:18:09,751 --> 01:18:10,751
Oh, my...

824
01:18:16,591 --> 01:18:17,591
Sweetheart.

825
01:18:19,861 --> 01:18:21,529
Just give Daddy the doll.

826
01:18:23,131 --> 01:18:25,332
There is no doll, Daddy.

827
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:28,903
Claire, give Daddy the doll.

828
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:38,946
No!

829
01:18:45,821 --> 01:18:48,589
Your daughter
doesn't need you anymore,

830
01:18:48,657 --> 01:18:49,757
and neither do I.

831
01:18:51,593 --> 01:18:53,394
Alyson!

832
01:18:53,462 --> 01:18:54,729
Claire!

833
01:19:00,502 --> 01:19:01,502
Claire...

834
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:05,840
Alyson!

835
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:10,611
Goodbye, Mommy.

836
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:17,184
No!

837
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:19,086
- No!
- The eyes!

838
01:22:16,197 --> 01:22:18,499
Can I help?

839
01:22:18,566 --> 01:22:21,335
Go upstairs and bring your
mother's dresser down here.

840
01:22:21,403 --> 01:22:23,971
- You think you can handle that?
- You're funny.

841
01:22:24,039 --> 01:22:25,906
No, there's some picture frames
in the living room.

842
01:22:25,974 --> 01:22:27,241
You can grab those.

843
01:22:27,309 --> 01:22:28,609
Okay.

844
01:22:33,682 --> 01:22:36,417
- She doesn't remember anything?
- Nothing.

845
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:40,187
I mean, she remembers moving
in here, but that's about it.

846
01:22:40,255 --> 01:22:43,223
Good.
Let's keep it that way.

847
01:22:45,894 --> 01:22:48,095
You sure about this?

848
01:22:48,163 --> 01:22:49,797
About what?

849
01:22:49,864 --> 01:22:51,498
About us.

850
01:22:51,566 --> 01:22:53,133
Yeah.

851
01:22:54,402 --> 01:22:55,836
I'm sure.

852
01:22:55,904 --> 01:22:57,171
I love you.

853
01:22:58,406 --> 01:23:00,307
I love you.

854
01:23:20,395 --> 01:23:21,562
Come on.

855
01:23:21,629 --> 01:23:23,664
Let's go home.

856
01:23:23,732 --> 01:23:25,099
Okay.

857
