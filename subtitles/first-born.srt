00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,971
Are you OK?

3
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:34,472
Yeah. God, I don't know
what's wrong with me.

4
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:39,780
I might just be coming down
with the flu, or something.

5
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:48,256
Don't tell me
you're pregnant.

6
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:51,126
I'm not pregnant.

7
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:05,703
No express service
between 34th and 14th Street.

8
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,263
We apologize
for the inconvenience.

9
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:45,861
Parker!

10
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:47,565
Parker, no!

11
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,567
Hi, honey.

12
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:18,763
Hey, what are you
still doing up?

13
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:21,033
I've been waiting for you.

14
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,199
Ah.

15
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:27,042
You know,
I think your man
might make partner.

16
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:31,413
What does your wife
get out of this partnership?

17
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:36,610
Oh, wow.

18
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:39,783
God, you look beautiful.

19
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:42,453
More beautiful than usual?

20
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,960
Maybe.
Maybe.

21
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,230
I'm pregnant.

22
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,536
Are you serious?

23
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,075
I'm serious.

24
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,132
Are you sure?

25
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:03,547
I'm sure.
I have four pregnancy tests
that say I am.

26
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,584
Oh my God.
I love you.

27
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:32,172
I really think it's time
we consider moving
out of the city.

28
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:35,476
You know?
Just like we always wanted.

29
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,645
You mean
like you've always wanted.

30
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:45,353
Wait, you said,
"l will never raise kids
in this city."

31
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:52,159
I know. I know.
But, I feel different now
that I'm actually having one.

32
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:55,564
Well anyway,
we should look
at a couple of places.

33
00:08:55,635 --> 00:09:01,733
Yeah? I've got the name
of a good real estate agent.

34
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:05,067
Will you think about it?

35
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,203
Maybe.
I'll think about it.

36
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,269
OK.

37
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:15,075
Ugh.

38
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,318
Get out of here now!
Get out! Go! Leave!

39
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:37,037
I've saved this property
for last

40
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:40,044
because I think
it's really special.

41
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,444
Now, as you can see
it's very private

42
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:46,645
but just as commutable
as the other homes
we've looked at.

43
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,613
Wow.

44
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,884
It's really big.

45
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,721
It's spacious

46
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,455
but don't let that put you off
until you've seen it.

47
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,361
Wow.

48
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,167
It's beautiful.

49
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,520
This home was built
with children in mind.

50
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,989
Do you plan
on having any children?

51
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:31,586
Actually I'm pregnant
right now.

52
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,894
That's wonderful.
Congratulations!

53
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,059
Thank you.
Thank you.

54
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,968
You have to admit
this would make
a perfect nursery.

55
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,596
Yeah.

56
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,578
With this much land
so close to the city,

57
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,948
I'm sure
it's out of our price range.
Isn't it?

58
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,748
No.
Actually the owners
are anxious

59
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,118
to get the place off their hands
as soon as possible.

60
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:58,178
Really?

61
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:00,054
Their daughter
went off to college,

62
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,060
so they decided to move
into the city.

63
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:06,121
I guess they felt
like this was too much house
for the two of them.

64
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,431
Come on.
We spoke about it.

65
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,866
Yeah, I know.
I know.

66
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,102
OK, it's finished.

67
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,109
Is it gonna work?

68
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:52,166
Yeah.

69
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:53,233
Y eah?

70
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:54,802
Yeah.
Go see for yourself.

71
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,918
Well?

72
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:39,287
Does it work?

73
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,989
It works.

74
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,719
Oh!
No, no!

75
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,256
What are you doing?

76
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:21,293
It's a mouse.
There's a mouse.

77
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,759
It's a what?

78
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:23,817
It's a mouse.

79
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,353
All right.

80
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:35,801
OK, I've got it.
Where is it?

81
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,536
He went
under the dresser.

82
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,736
Under here?

83
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:39,903
Yeah.

84
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,071
OK.

85
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,746
OK, mousy,
come on.

86
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,217
What are you doing
with that?

87
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:50,945
He's probably
next door by now.

88
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:20,809
Can I write you
a check?

89
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:22,877
Yeah.
Yeah, you can write me
a check.

90
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,286
Oh, good.

91
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:38,698
You moved
into Jenny's old house?
1 620 Woodland Lane.

92
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:42,104
Oh.
Yeah, I guess I did.

93
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:48,306
That's Jenny's house.
She used to work here.
We were pretty decent friends.

94
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:53,041
Thanks.

95
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,585
Thank you very much.

96
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,119
Let me tell you,

97
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,856
they didn't have
the drugs back then
that they do now.

98
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,192
I'm sure.

99
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:16,462
But Mom,
I don't want
the drugs.

100
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,368
I'm planning on having
a natural birth.

101
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:20,700
You don't want
the drugs?

102
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:21,762
Nope.

103
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,671
What the hell
are you talking about?

104
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:26,040
Are you crazy?
Who wouldn't want
the drugs?

105
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:29,171
Mom, you know
the drugs are actually
bad for the baby.

106
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,875
They aren't bad
for the baby.

107
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:31,938
Y es, they are.

108
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,679
You'll be singing
a different tune
when the baby comes.

109
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:37,813
Trust me.
Yoga and all that breathing
doesn't mean shit

110
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,121
with a ten pound parasite
coming out
from between your legs.

111
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:45,630
It's true.
Why do you think
you're an only child?

112
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:47,130
Mom, you're scaring me.

113
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,895
Well, you should be scared.
You should be horrified.

114
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:52,266
I'd come but I don't even
want to be reminded.

115
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:55,636
Thanks for the support, Mom.
Could you just hold on
for one second?

116
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,231
I want to put
Parker downstairs.

117
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,174
He's been driving me
up the wall lately.

118
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,233
OK.

119
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:01,438
Come here.

120
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:04,038
Oh God.

121
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,183
There you go.

122
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,654
Hi.

123
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:44,047
Mom, I need to go.

124
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,751
I'm actually cooking
dinner for Steven tonight.

125
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:49,293
Cook?
Did you move to a farm?

126
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:51,852
What?
They don't have delivery
out there?

127
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,693
I like cooking.

128
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:56,791
And Steven's been working
really hard lately

129
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:59,337
and he comes home
like ten o'clock at night

130
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:00,871
and I think
he'd like a meal.

131
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:05,035
Well, I hope he doesn't plan
on working these kind of hours
when the baby comes.

132
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,874
He's going to take some time
off when the baby comes.

133
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:08,935
OK.
Good.

134
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:10,709
It's great to talk to you.

135
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:11,976
You too, sweetie.

136
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,711
O K.
T ake care
of yourself, OK?

137
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:15,343
You take care of yourself.
Bye.

138
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,921
Parker!
Come here, boy!

139
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,755
Come on!
It's time to eat!

140
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,125
Come here!
Come on!

141
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,858
Parker!

142
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:33,662
Parker.
How you doing?

143
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,805
Oh God!

144
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:57,894
No! Oh God!

145
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,507
I am so sorry.

146
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:12,669
I had a nightmare
of a phone call
just as I was leaving.

147
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:18,407
You OK?

148
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,621
I killed Parker.

149
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:28,988
What?

150
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,222
I'm sorry.

151
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,858
How?

152
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:21,846
Does this mean
I'll be a horrible mother?

153
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,413
Laura... it wasn't your fault.

154
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:29,653
It was an accident.

155
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:35,456
Why didn't I close
the door to the laundry room?

156
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:39,463
Why didn't I do that?

157
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:41,897
Let's get some sleep, eh?

158
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,068
I'm sorry.

159
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,165
I know.

160
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:54,801
I know.

161
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,163
I'm sorry.

162
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:55,306
I'm sorry.

163
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,365
Oh!

164
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,478
Oh no!

165
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,518
Oh no!

166
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,410
Is there something wrong?

167
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:27,542
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be
all right.

168
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:48,860
She's fine.
Everything's fine.

169
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:50,525
Laura.

170
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:54,398
Actually, she's asleep
right now but, uhm,

171
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:58,465
they're just gonna keep her
in for a few more days
because of the c-section.

172
00:27:58,543 --> 00:28:01,137
You OK?

173
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:03,407
Yeah, I'm,
I'm a little tired.

174
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:06,177
You'll be able to rest
as soon as you feed her.

175
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:08,742
We advise our mothers
who've had a c-section

176
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,913
to breastfeed on their sides

177
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:15,517
because your abdominals
are going to be sore
for awhile.

178
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:30,702
It takes some practice.
You can do it.

179
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:34,368
I don't think
she wants it.

180
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:37,711
No, oh, you've got to be really--

181
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:40,046
careful to make sure
that her mouth
is on it.

182
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,450
You don't want to starve
your baby to death,

183
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:46,547
thinking she's feeding
when she's not.
I've seen it happen.

184
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:51,689
Ah.
See?

185
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:54,391
Now, from here on out

186
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:56,991
everything's pretty
much downhill.

187
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:22,151
There you go.

188
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,085
Oh God.

189
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,248
Hey.

190
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:53,443
Hi.

191
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:57,887
Hello.
Hello, little one.

192
00:30:57,956 --> 00:30:59,924
Hello, my little one.

193
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:05,251
No.
Oh-oh-oh.

194
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:08,723
How long you been up?

195
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,360
Uh, I don't know.

196
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:12,926
What time is it?

197
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:15,529
It's about six thirty.

198
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:19,236
I don't even think
I slept.

199
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,335
I heard those mice again.

200
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:25,405
Oh Jesus.
Look, I'll call the exterminator.

201
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:28,111
I'll make sure
someone gets out here
today. OK?

202
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:29,881
OK.

203
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:31,922
OK.

204
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,788
I've got to go.

205
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:38,289
I've got to go,
sweetheart.

206
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:42,391
Oh. Here we go.

207
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,697
There we go.

208
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:46,964
See you.

209
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,177
When are you coming home?

210
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,974
I'll call.

211
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:55,801
God!

212
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:58,402
Is there something wrong?

213
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,468
I assure you
it's perfectly normal.

214
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:02,979
I, I,
it's just that--

215
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:06,175
Just use the ointment
I prescribed
and you should be fine.

216
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,013
Really.

217
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:10,577
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've really got to go.

218
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,145
O K, bye.

219
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,884
You got a rodent problem?

220
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,045
Hello?

221
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:45,111
Hi.

222
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,178
Hi.

223
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:47,485
Why'd you call
so early?

224
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:49,082
I didn't.

225
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,424
Yeah.
Like around four
I got your message.

226
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:53,896
Oh, oh.

227
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,159
Are you OK?

228
00:33:55,233 --> 00:34:01,502
Mom, how did you feel
after you gave birth
to me?

229
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:04,871
How did I feel?
I felt like shit.

230
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:06,341
You did?

231
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:10,074
How else
are you supposed to feel
after you've just had a baby?

232
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:12,480
So, what,
you've got the blues
or something?

233
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,381
It's like I have
so much anxiety.

234
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:17,148
I'm just worried
about every little stupid thing.

235
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:20,622
Yeah well, don't worry.
It goes away.
You'll be fine.

236
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:21,783
It does?

237
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:25,522
It's one of those aspects
of having a baby
that people fail to mention.

238
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:28,156
Hormones,
they're horrible.

239
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:31,258
It's weird.
I feel like I 'm going crazy.

240
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:33,530
You're not going crazy.

241
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:35,936
Excuse me.
Basement?

242
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:38,908
There's only room
for one crazy person
in this family

243
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:41,035
and I already
got the job.

244
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:21,811
I promise you,
it'll get better soon.

245
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:24,946
You just need to get
some sleep.
At least five hours.

246
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:26,512
How am l
supposed to do that?

247
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,354
The baby eats
like every two hours.

248
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:41,939
I 'm not going to do that.
He has a really stressful job.
OK?

249
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:44,770
He can't get up like ten times
in the middle of the night.

250
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:47,504
And you can?
You guys
should take turns.

251
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:51,014
So he has a job.
He goes and does his job.
Then he comes home

252
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:53,642
and he has another job.
He's the father.

253
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:56,949
The mother isn't the only one
who's responsible
for the child.

254
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,957
Mom...
can I call you back?

255
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:09,329
OK.

256
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:14,900
I'm sorry.

257
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:18,203
No problem.
I'm just glad
you were around.

258
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:24,503
I laid some traps
even though
I didn't see any droppings.

259
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:28,348
But you never know.
They say if you got one mouse
you got forty.

260
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:32,549
Like I said,
mice like to run up and down
the pipes.

261
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:35,990
So if I were you,
I wouldn't leave your diary
in the utility closet.

262
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,891
Mice like to eat
that kind of stuff.

263
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:39,486
What diary?

264
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:42,590
I just assumed it was yours.
It looked kind of girlie.

265
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:45,431
If you'll just sign there,
Ma'am.

266
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:48,597
Thank you.
And you call me
if you hear anything else.

267
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:49,662
OK, I will.

268
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:39,882
Oh God!

269
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:45,486
Help!
Help!

270
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:49,688
Help!!
Help!!

271
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:58,605
What are you talking about?

272
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:01,372
You are kidding me?

273
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:06,078
Don't tell me that.
Why is he springing this shit
on us now?

274
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:11,985
This is meant to be finished.
This is meant to be a deal.

275
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:13,387
I can't believe this.

276
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:17,188
Look John,
It's a little bit late
in the day for this.

277
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:18,853
Y eah.

278
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:24,260
Sorry to interrupt, John.
I 'm gonna have to call you back.
OK?

279
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:25,768
Bye-bye.

280
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:30,631
Hey, darling, hey.

281
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:32,573
Where's mommy?

282
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:39,714
Sh, sh, sh.
All right, all right.
Laura!

283
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:45,418
Laura!

284
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:50,860
Laura!!
Laura!!!

285
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:55,358
Laura!

286
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:56,764
Laura!!

287
00:38:56,834 --> 00:39:02,272
Steven, I'm in the basement!

288
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,503
Open the door!

289
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:10,678
Jesus. What happened?
O K. All right.

290
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:15,048
I have to feed her!
I have to feed her!

291
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:19,423
I practically abandoned her.

292
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,980
Laura, she's fine.

293
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:23,193
She's never
gonna forgive me.

294
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:27,863
There's nothing to forgive.

295
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:32,335
Anyway, she's a baby.
She forgave you
the moment you fed her.

296
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:35,338
I think she thinks
I'm a bad mother.

297
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:37,499
Listen to me.

298
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:40,408
Listen.

299
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:42,571
You're a great mother.

300
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:45,545
I'm not.

301
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:47,880
I'm a terrible mother.

302
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:14,003
Can I help you?

303
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,444
Are you Mrs. Davis?

304
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:18,573
Yes.

305
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:22,915
I am Mrs. Kasperian.
Your husband sent me.
He said you need helper.

306
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:25,854
Steven...called you?

307
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:30,121
He's very good man.
He knows it's not easy
to be a mother.

308
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:33,322
I'm not looking
for any help right now.

309
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:38,767
Well, he sent me.
Maybe you would like
to telephone him. I wait.

310
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:44,207
All right,
I'll call him.

311
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,264
You can come in.

312
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:47,367
Thank you.

313
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:56,847
Is your mother coming?

314
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:58,445
No.

315
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:00,922
Thank God
she doesn't want to fly.

316
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:04,449
Where is she?

317
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:06,257
She's in Los Angeles.

318
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:09,390
Are you from there?

319
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,459
Yes.

320
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:18,236
When I had my first baby,
I wanted to go home to Mother.
I was very scared.

321
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,437
But she convinced me
to stay here.

322
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:26,711
Outside this country,
many mothers and babies
don't make it.

323
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:29,412
Here, very few women
have troubles.

324
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:35,615
Oh, look.
She's sound asleep.

325
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:41,663
Would you like me
to put her in the crib
for you?

326
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:43,632
No.

327
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:47,498
She's very beautiful.

328
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:51,097
Shall I go on folding?

329
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,164
Sure.

330
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,103
Always so much laundry.

331
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:09,245
Mrs. Davis?

332
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:14,155
Baby is sleeping upstairs.
You should get some rest too.

333
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:16,852
I will.

334
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:19,923
I'm going now.

335
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:21,021
Thank you.

336
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,895
You're welcome.

337
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:26,231
You get some rest.

338
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:57,564
Did you remember to call
Mrs. Kasperian
about baby sitting tonight?

339
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,331
You didn't forget
about the party tonight,
did you?

340
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:02,372
I didn't.
I called her.
She's coming.

341
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:04,202
Good.
Good.

342
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:09,337
It's all right.
You had me scared there
for a minute.

343
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:13,179
Oh, can you make sure
that you show up on time?

344
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,946
It's just that we're considered
to be one of the hosts

345
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:19,581
and I want to make sure
that we greet everyone
as they come in.

346
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:36,002
Oh my God.

347
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:27,188
How's your mouse problem?

348
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:32,354
They're doing great.
They are so good.

349
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:37,926
Hey, do you remember
that girl that you
told me about?

350
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:40,595
I think
I found something
of hers

351
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:42,468
and I was wondering
if I could reach her.

352
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:47,499
Uhm, I don't have a number
but she went to NYU.

353
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:50,046
I'm sure you can just call
their directory.

354
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:51,706
What was her name again?

355
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:53,443
Jenny.

356
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:57,078
Ugh.

357
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,903
Wait a minute.

358
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:27,171
Wait a minute!

359
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:39,585
Oh my God! Jesus Christ!
All right. Where is she?
Where is she?

360
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:51,665
Oh my God.

361
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:53,327
Oh my God!!

362
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,404
Oh my God.

363
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:06,813
Oh my God.

364
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,114
Oh my God!

365
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:13,782
Oh my God!
Oh my God!

366
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:18,151
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

367
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:42,575
I'm sorry.

368
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:18,345
Mrs. Davis?

369
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:26,992
What you do
to your hair?

370
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:33,359
Oh no.

371
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:35,064
Oh no!

372
00:49:38,842 --> 00:49:40,241
Will you take her?

373
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:41,299
Yes. Of course.

374
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:44,176
She'll be fine.
It's all right.

375
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:48,206
It's all right.
Little one.

376
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:52,449
She's fine.
Oh, little one.

377
00:49:52,522 --> 00:49:56,253
Oh, little one.

378
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:37,693
Is everything all right,
Mrs. Davis?

379
00:50:37,768 --> 00:50:40,931
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm--

380
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:41,993
I'm fine.

381
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:49,642
Thank you.

382
00:50:50,814 --> 00:50:53,806
You're welcome.
I'm glad
I could help.

383
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:01,949
You are not happy,
Mrs. Davis.

384
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:05,652
Why do you say that?

385
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:08,527
You remind me
a little of myself.

386
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:13,825
When I had my first baby,
I wasn't happy either.

387
00:51:15,672 --> 00:51:20,803
I didn't feel the way
I thought
a mother should feel.

388
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:22,242
Really?

389
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:25,475
I had first baby
here in the States.

390
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:29,679
I was
too far from home.

391
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:32,347
I was very lonely.

392
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:34,253
And I had no one
to help me.

393
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:37,691
I couldn't eat,
I couldn't sleep,

394
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:42,323
I worried about the baby
all the time.

395
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:45,891
I had many thoughts
of death,

396
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:50,531
I had terrible dreams,
even more terrible thoughts.

397
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:55,237
My mother thought
someone put evil curse
on me.

398
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,241
What did you do?

399
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:01,546
I prayed a lot.

400
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:06,615
Did it help?

401
00:52:08,091 --> 00:52:09,388
No.

402
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:17,262
I went to someone
people said was good
at removing evil curses.

403
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:24,536
She told me
that when a mother has a baby,
she's cut in two pieces.

404
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:28,408
One piece is baby,
one piece is mother.

405
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,969
But sometimes
baby takes too much.

406
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:35,814
Baby steals mother's soul
and mother begins to die.

407
00:52:38,855 --> 00:52:41,881
How did you overcome
those feelings?

408
00:52:45,395 --> 00:52:47,454
I got my soul back.

409
00:53:04,214 --> 00:53:05,272
Hello?

410
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:06,713
Hi.

411
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:07,772
Hi!

412
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:10,115
I was wondering
if you'd left yet.

413
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:13,122
Uh, uh, where?

414
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,818
Oh, Lord,
tell me you didn't forget,
you promised.

415
00:53:15,892 --> 00:53:19,623
Oh God,
yes, I know, I know.
I'll be there!

416
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:21,493
Well, did you call
Mrs. Kasperian?

417
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:23,294
Uhm, yeah,
she's here.

418
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:25,994
OK, can you hurry?

419
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:28,671
Oh.

420
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:33,471
I really--
I really don't feel
like I'm up for it, though.

421
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:39,106
Look, all I asked you to do
was to come on time,
and to look nice, and smile.

422
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:43,551
And now what?
You're telling me
you can't even do that?

423
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,417
All right.
I'll be there.

424
00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:46,750
You know
I wouldn't ask--

425
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:48,017
I'll be there
in an hour.

426
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:50,616
Good. Great.
Thanks.

427
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:51,683
Bye.

428
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:53,524
I'll see you soon.
Bye.

429
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:11,608
Oh no.

430
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:25,021
Oh no.

431
00:54:59,863 --> 00:55:01,797
Is that Steven's wife?

432
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:04,026
Yes.
She just had a baby.

433
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:08,659
I mean, it changes you.
There's no question but...

434
00:55:08,738 --> 00:55:11,366
we're really happy.

435
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:13,238
I'm sorry,
excuse me.

436
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:17,980
Why didn't you tell me
it was black tie?

437
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:20,016
What did you do
to your hair?

438
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:22,381
I know. OK?
I had a really hard day.
All right?

439
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:23,544
You've no idea what--

440
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:24,746
Steven.

441
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:25,845
Hey.

442
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:28,618
I'm glad to see you let
the little lady out of the house.

443
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:30,489
It wouldn't be a party
without Laura.

444
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,393
I just love what you've done
with your hair.

445
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:36,455
So vanguard.

446
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:37,932
Thank you.

447
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,366
How's the kid?

448
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:42,633
We hear she is
the most beautiful child
in company history.

449
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:43,934
Yes, where is she?

450
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,100
She's at home
with the babysitter.

451
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,440
Oh! Well, we're all dying
to see her.

452
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,741
You should've
brought her along.

453
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:52,839
I can't believe
you left her at home.

454
00:55:56,052 --> 00:55:59,112
I'm gonna call her
right now.
Do you have a phone?

455
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,181
Yeah, yeah.
Of course.

456
00:56:03,993 --> 00:56:05,085
Thank you.

457
00:56:05,161 --> 00:56:07,186
It's so great
to see you guys.

458
00:56:07,263 --> 00:56:08,662
Glad you made it.

459
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:10,063
I love your dress.

460
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:11,122
Thanks.

461
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:12,894
She'll be right back.

462
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,401
Is everything all right?

463
00:56:14,471 --> 00:56:15,460
Yeah, good.

464
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:13,888
What is she doing?!

465
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:36,444
Hey!

466
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,845
I was looking
for you.

467
00:58:38,915 --> 00:58:40,815
I want to go home.

468
00:58:40,884 --> 00:58:42,749
What are you
talking about?

469
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:45,083
I'm just gonna go home.

470
00:58:47,123 --> 00:58:48,181
Laura.

471
00:58:49,893 --> 00:58:51,485
Laura!

472
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:54,990
Laura!!

473
00:59:02,805 --> 00:59:04,033
Hi.

474
00:59:04,107 --> 00:59:05,267
Hi.

475
00:59:05,341 --> 00:59:06,365
Where's the baby?

476
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:08,376
She's upstairs sleeping.

477
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:10,810
Why didn't you answer
the phone?

478
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,372
I didn't hear it.
I must have been upstairs.
I'm so sorry.

479
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:17,078
I'm gonna go check on her.

480
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:18,711
Is everything OK?

481
00:59:18,788 --> 00:59:20,312
Everything's fine.

482
00:59:35,872 --> 00:59:38,033
Is everything OK?

483
00:59:40,443 --> 00:59:42,877
Didn't you hear everybody
talking about me?

484
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,609
No.
What are you
talking about?

485
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:48,446
At the party.
All the coworkers.

486
00:59:48,518 --> 00:59:51,681
You didn't hear
all the awful things
they were saying about me?

487
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:53,688
Right. So is that
why you stormed out?

488
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:56,748
No. I went and I called
and no one picked
up the phone.

489
00:59:56,826 --> 00:59:59,260
Well, I think,

490
00:59:59,329 --> 01:00:01,160
I think you owe me
an apology.

491
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:04,358
You knew how important
this was to me.

492
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:10,131
But no,
you show up late.

493
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:11,696
And you look a mess.

494
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:16,234
And then,
you're there for ten minutes
before you storm out.

495
01:00:16,312 --> 01:00:17,301
I'm sorry.

496
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:20,315
I was worried
about the baby.

497
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:22,639
Oh no!

498
01:01:33,489 --> 01:01:38,051
Steven! Don't take the baby
without telling me!

499
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:41,389
Oh my God,

500
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:42,453
you're bleeding.

501
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:49,134
Oh God.

502
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:54,537
Have you had
excessive vaginal bleeding?

503
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:55,872
No.

504
01:01:55,945 --> 01:01:57,810
Have you started having
sex again?

505
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:00,811
No.

506
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:03,283
How often
do you bathe?

507
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:05,843
I take showers.

508
01:02:05,922 --> 01:02:08,288
Sometimes more than once.

509
01:02:08,357 --> 01:02:12,794
Well, your stitching
seems to have gotten infected.

510
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:17,298
I don't want to take
anything 'cause, uhm,

511
01:02:17,366 --> 01:02:20,426
I'm still breastfeeding
and I don't want to hurt
the baby.

512
01:02:20,503 --> 01:02:22,767
This won't hurt the baby.

513
01:02:22,839 --> 01:02:24,602
It's just antibiotics.

514
01:02:24,674 --> 01:02:27,973
Take them three times a day
and everything should be fine.

515
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:32,447
And you're also
having problems sleeping?

516
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:35,882
Yeah. I'm having
a lot of anxiety
and I'm feeling--

517
01:02:35,952 --> 01:02:39,683
Take two of these
right before you want to go
to sleep.

518
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:47,788
Oh, the breastfeeding.

519
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:49,553
Here.

520
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,024
This will be better.

521
01:02:53,336 --> 01:02:56,396
Maybe start out taking half,
see how it does.

522
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:01,035
H uh.

523
01:04:09,745 --> 01:04:11,508
Hello, Mrs. Davis.

524
01:04:11,581 --> 01:04:14,948
I can't get her to stop crying.
I don't know
what's wrong with her.

525
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:19,716
I fed her
and then I changed her.
And she just won't stop!

526
01:04:19,789 --> 01:04:22,587
Maybe I could try.

527
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:26,094
Sometimes all you need
is a different person.

528
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:41,069
How did you do that?

529
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:43,270
How did you stop
her crying?

530
01:04:43,346 --> 01:04:45,871
I, I don't know.

531
01:04:48,684 --> 01:04:52,711
Maybe you could go up,
take a little rest.

532
01:04:56,459 --> 01:04:57,756
Yeah.

533
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:29,451
Oh. Oh.

534
01:05:57,887 --> 01:06:01,687
Oh little one.
Here we go.

535
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:19,139
No!

536
01:06:33,522 --> 01:06:36,286
No! No!
What are you doing?

537
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:38,054
I find this knife
in baby's crib.

538
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:39,585
I don't believe you.

539
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:41,630
I protect your baby.

540
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:42,925
Step away
from the crib!

541
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:44,023
No.

542
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:45,499
Get away from the crib!!!

543
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:46,694
You need help!

544
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:51,035
Get the hell out of my house!
I'm going to kill you!

545
01:06:58,314 --> 01:07:01,112
It's OK.
It's OK.

546
01:07:04,387 --> 01:07:06,685
Thank God
the baby's OK.

547
01:07:08,124 --> 01:07:10,752
Did she say anything
when you confronted her?

548
01:07:10,826 --> 01:07:15,229
I asked her to step away
from the crib
and she wouldn't move.

549
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:18,690
I have to tell you,
Mrs. Davis,

550
01:07:18,768 --> 01:07:21,066
I've known Mrs. Kasperian
for a long time

551
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:23,628
and I just can't imagine
she'd harm a baby.

552
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:26,732
Well, then why
did she have a knife
in the baby's room?

553
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:29,505
I don't know.
We're going to go
and talk to her.

554
01:07:31,347 --> 01:07:32,336
Hey, how are you?

555
01:07:32,581 --> 01:07:33,570
Hi.

556
01:07:35,184 --> 01:07:36,674
Cigarettes?

557
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:40,352
I'm sorry,
it's none of my business.

558
01:07:40,956 --> 01:07:43,015
Did you ever get in contact
with Jenny?

559
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,920
You said she left something
at the house.

560
01:07:46,996 --> 01:07:49,294
So I was just wondering
how she was doing.

561
01:07:49,365 --> 01:07:51,833
I gotta call her.
I'm gonna call her tomorrow.

562
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:56,031
Thanks.
Good to see you.
OK.

563
01:07:56,105 --> 01:07:57,868
Bye.

564
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:07,306
New York University
student directory.

565
01:08:07,383 --> 01:08:09,283
I'm looking
for a Jenny Foster.

566
01:08:09,351 --> 01:08:11,342
Uh, she goes
to school there.

567
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:13,183
OK,
one moment please.

568
01:08:21,063 --> 01:08:22,530
I'm sorry,
we have no record

569
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:24,930
of a Jennifer Foster
attending school here.

570
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:28,659
Hello?

571
01:08:30,573 --> 01:08:35,135
The earth, the dirt,
the blackness inside.

572
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:37,839
Nothing in this room
makes me feel welcome.

573
01:08:37,913 --> 01:08:40,143
How am I ever
going to tell them about this?

574
01:08:40,216 --> 01:08:42,116
I hear voices.
Desperate.

575
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:45,881
Are they my voices
or someone else's?

576
01:08:49,191 --> 01:08:53,924
I feel so cold in here.

577
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:12,410
I 'll be right back.
O K? I 'll be right back.

578
01:12:41,657 --> 01:12:43,215
Police.

579
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:44,953
Someone is breaking
into my house!

580
01:12:45,994 --> 01:12:47,689
Ah! Ah!

581
01:13:39,681 --> 01:13:41,273
I called the police!!

582
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:43,875
They're gonna be here
any second!!

583
01:15:19,414 --> 01:15:20,608
Ahh!!

584
01:15:23,118 --> 01:15:25,211
I want my baby!!

585
01:16:07,763 --> 01:16:09,196
Ah!

586
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:14,263
Ah!

587
01:16:42,364 --> 01:16:44,457
I don't know
what she looked like.

588
01:16:44,533 --> 01:16:46,501
What's going on?

589
01:16:46,568 --> 01:16:49,867
Your wife called
about an intruder.

590
01:16:50,839 --> 01:16:52,136
Someone tried to break in?

591
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:53,196
Yes.

592
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:54,572
Jesus.
What happened?

593
01:16:54,643 --> 01:16:56,474
There was a woman
and she was outside

594
01:16:56,545 --> 01:16:59,673
and then she came inside
and then she was coming upstairs
and--

595
01:16:59,748 --> 01:17:01,010
She was gonna take
the baby.

596
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:02,072
Was it Mrs. Kasperian?

597
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:04,345
I don't think
it was Mrs. Kasperian.

598
01:17:04,419 --> 01:17:06,546
You know
she threatened Laura
with a knife.

599
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:08,613
No, she didn't threaten me
with a knife.

600
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:09,679
You know
what I mean.

601
01:17:09,758 --> 01:17:11,589
We talked
to her earlier.

602
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:12,991
You talked to her?

603
01:17:13,061 --> 01:17:16,224
You just talked to her?
You didn't arrest her?

604
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:18,061
It wasn't
Mrs. Kasperian.

605
01:17:18,133 --> 01:17:19,122
Are you sure?

606
01:17:19,201 --> 01:17:22,534
Yeah. No.
I mean, it wasn't

607
01:17:22,604 --> 01:17:24,572
it didn't look
like her but--

608
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,767
I don't know.
she looked
more like me then,

609
01:17:26,842 --> 01:17:29,640
I don't know.
I want to put
the baby to bed.

610
01:17:33,215 --> 01:17:35,308
Can I talk to you
for a second?

611
01:17:35,384 --> 01:17:37,716
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.

612
01:17:37,786 --> 01:17:40,152
Look, I know
your wife's really upset.

613
01:17:40,222 --> 01:17:44,124
But I'm going to be honest
with you.
Her story doesn't add up.

614
01:17:44,192 --> 01:17:47,684
Maybe she's a little lonely
out here by herself

615
01:17:47,763 --> 01:17:51,130
and worked herself
up into a frenzy.
I've seen it before.

616
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:54,999
Are you telling me you think
my wife called you
just to get some attention?

617
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:56,970
Are you
out of your mind?

618
01:17:57,039 --> 01:18:00,406
I'm just saying
that I don't see anything
that leads me to believe

619
01:18:00,475 --> 01:18:04,070
that anyone
other than your wife
was here.

620
01:18:04,146 --> 01:18:06,341
I talked
to Mrs. Kasperian.

621
01:18:06,415 --> 01:18:10,044
She said she found the knife
already in the baby's crib.

622
01:18:10,118 --> 01:18:11,517
And you believe that?

623
01:18:11,586 --> 01:18:15,989
M r. Davis,
I don't know what to believe.
That's my point.

624
01:18:16,058 --> 01:18:18,492
Well, gentlemen,
thanks for coming out.

625
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:19,891
Now look,
I am not saying--

626
01:18:19,961 --> 01:18:21,189
Good night, gentlemen.

627
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:28,360
Call us
if you need us.

628
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:56,394
Are you O K?

629
01:18:56,465 --> 01:18:59,366
I don't know
what's going on.

630
01:18:59,434 --> 01:19:03,564
It's OK.
Everything's going to be
all right.

631
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:08,232
But l... I saw her.

632
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:09,538
I know.

633
01:19:09,611 --> 01:19:13,240
I believe you.
Let's get some sleep.

634
01:20:46,274 --> 01:20:48,208
Shhhh.

635
01:21:58,179 --> 01:22:02,878
Yeah, look,
I just need a few days.
OK?

636
01:22:02,951 --> 01:22:06,114
I mean,
Jake can take care of things.

637
01:22:06,187 --> 01:22:10,317
I mean, he can always call me
if he needs me, anyway.

638
01:22:10,392 --> 01:22:12,121
Yeah.

639
01:22:12,193 --> 01:22:14,753
Yeah, yeah.
I know. I know.

640
01:22:14,829 --> 01:22:18,060
Well, uh,
look, I'll deal
with that on Monday--

641
01:22:20,535 --> 01:22:21,593
Oh my God!

642
01:22:46,561 --> 01:22:50,258
Ah!

643
01:22:51,433 --> 01:22:53,094
Oh.

644
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:21,554
Excuse me,
do you have
any books on curses?

645
01:23:21,629 --> 01:23:24,291
You mean
like witchcraft?

646
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:26,724
Yeah.

647
01:23:29,537 --> 01:23:31,664
My personal favorite.

648
01:25:08,036 --> 01:25:10,197
Get off!
Get off!

649
01:25:10,271 --> 01:25:11,738
Get off!!

650
01:25:11,806 --> 01:25:14,104
No! No!
Get off!

651
01:25:20,982 --> 01:25:22,506
Laura!

652
01:25:36,598 --> 01:25:40,090
I gave her something
that will help her sleep.

653
01:25:40,168 --> 01:25:41,863
Well, what's wrong
with her?

654
01:25:41,936 --> 01:25:43,198
It's too early to tell.

655
01:25:43,271 --> 01:25:45,967
We're going to keep her here
and monitor her behavior.

656
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:48,941
She may be suffering
from Postpartum Psychosis.

657
01:26:15,103 --> 01:26:17,867
You're starting to look
like yourself again.

658
01:26:17,972 --> 01:26:19,906
The doctors say
it's time to come home.

659
01:26:19,974 --> 01:26:21,305
Where's the baby?

660
01:26:21,376 --> 01:26:25,039
She's fine.
Your mother's with her
right now.

661
01:26:25,113 --> 01:26:26,307
I'm sorry.

662
01:26:26,381 --> 01:26:27,780
Don't say sorry.

663
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:29,544
I ' m sorry.
I didn't really mean--

664
01:26:29,617 --> 01:26:31,778
I didn't want to hurt her.

665
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:34,981
I don't want to hear you
say "sorry" anymore.

666
01:26:35,056 --> 01:26:40,995
OK? It's over.
It happened.
It doesn't matter.

667
01:26:41,062 --> 01:26:42,427
You know?

668
01:26:42,497 --> 01:26:45,398
Yeah, I'm happy
you're here.

669
01:26:45,466 --> 01:26:47,093
Good.

670
01:26:47,168 --> 01:26:48,726
I miss you.

671
01:26:48,803 --> 01:26:51,033
I'm right here, sweetheart.
I'm right here.

672
01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:52,929
OK?

673
01:26:56,711 --> 01:26:58,679
We just got to get you better.

674
01:27:03,751 --> 01:27:05,514
Hi, Mom.

675
01:27:05,587 --> 01:27:07,145
Hi, sweetie.

676
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:13,417
She's beautiful.

677
01:27:13,494 --> 01:27:15,928
Yes, she is,
isn't she?

678
01:27:17,098 --> 01:27:18,622
How are you feeling?

679
01:27:19,767 --> 01:27:21,701
I feel better.

680
01:27:21,769 --> 01:27:24,033
Thank you for coming.

681
01:27:25,373 --> 01:27:27,933
I didn't realize
how much I could use your help.

682
01:27:28,009 --> 01:27:29,977
Well, if you told me
how cute she was

683
01:27:30,044 --> 01:27:32,478
I would have been
on the first plane here.

684
01:27:34,816 --> 01:27:37,614
Well you know,
now that Steven
is taking a month off,

685
01:27:37,685 --> 01:27:40,210
and you're going to be here
for a while,

686
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:43,985
I thought maybe
I would start dancing again.

687
01:27:44,058 --> 01:27:45,753
Well, that's a great idea.

688
01:27:50,498 --> 01:27:53,023
That's a girl.

689
01:28:16,591 --> 01:28:19,389
It's great to see you
dancing again.

690
01:28:24,265 --> 01:28:26,426
You look beautiful.

691
01:33:07,081 --> 01:33:08,912
Where's the baby?

692
01:33:08,983 --> 01:33:11,508
Uh, I think
she's still sleeping.

693
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:13,349
Hm.

694
01:33:13,421 --> 01:33:14,786
I'll go check on her.

695
01:33:14,855 --> 01:33:16,322
Hm.

696
01:33:45,486 --> 01:33:47,351
Good morning, sweetheart.

697
01:33:47,421 --> 01:33:48,888
Good morning.

698
01:33:51,659 --> 01:33:53,388
Where's Jessica?

699
01:34:01,202 --> 01:34:02,897
Who's Jessica?

700
01:34:08,542 --> 01:34:10,305
Laura, where's the baby?

701
01:34:14,415 --> 01:34:16,144
What baby?

702
01:34:22,356 --> 01:34:24,221
Jessica!

703
01:34:25,893 --> 01:34:27,656
Jessica!!

704
01:34:30,631 --> 01:34:32,258
Jessica!!!

705
01:34:33,305 --> 01:34:39,190
