<i>It was the summer of 1917
and the world was at war.</i>

3
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,831
<i>Like lots of children, we had to leave
our home - leave London.</i>

4
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,114
<i>We didn't want to go, but Dad went to fly planes</i>

5
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,397
<i>and Mum went to look after the wounded,
and we were stuck.</i>

6
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,471
<i>They insisted we go to the country</i>

7
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,711
<i>to stay with mad Uncle Albert
and our cousin Horace.</i>

8
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,316
Read all about it! Read all about it!

9
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,233
<i>Sopwith squadrons to go to 
the Western Front.</i>

10
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,197
<i>Robert!
- The latest news!</i>

11
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,794
<i>Robert, wait!</i>

12
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,519
Now, Uncle Albert will meet you at the station.

13
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,637
Do you think he'll have model planes -
fighters, like Dad's?

14
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,111
I'm not sure, but he has a son called Horace
who's about your age. He might.

15
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,714
Children, you're to listen to Cyril
while we're away.

16
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,916
Why's he in charge?
You're not in charge of me!

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,194
Robert, I am.

18
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,510
Find a nice...
Oh, there's an empty carriage here.

19
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,828
- Dad.
- What?

20
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,949
Dad.

21
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,679
Is there any way I can come with you?

22
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,275
Robert, who's the most important
member of any mission?

23
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,476
You are - the pilot.

24
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,597
No, it's the navigator.
The pilot would be lost without one.

25
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,598
Your mum and I need you
to keep everyone on course.

26
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,671
You can count on me.

27
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,556
So you always know where to find me.

28
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,313
Your compass.

29
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,278
I'm going to miss you.

30
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,716
Come on. On you get.

31
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,872
<i>- All aboard!
- Look after yourself.</i>

32
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,359
- Be a brave girl.
- Cyril.

33
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,351
Promise to do as Uncle Albert tells you.

34
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,317
Anthea, take that. Here's another.

35
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,711
- Bye, Mummy!
- Wish you were coming.

36
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,074
<i>- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, Mum.</i>

37
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,712
<i>After we left,
CyriI was trying to show me who was boss.</i>

38
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,671
<i>I didn't pay him any attention, though.</i>

39
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,069
<i>I began to think, if I played my cards right,</i>

40
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,631
<i>a summer in the country with no parents about
could only mean one thing.</i>

41
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,199
<i>Adventure.</i>

42
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,239
<i>Of course, I never dreamed
just how amazing an adventure it would be.</i>

43
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,748
Robert, wait!

44
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,155
Robert, what have I told you?
Wait on the platform.

45
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,998
Hello!

46
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,350
I'll take those.

47
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,993
<i>Mind the doors!</i>

48
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,591
- Hurry up.
- Close all the doors, please.

49
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,669
Can you see Uncle?
He must be here somewhere.

50
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,593
- Maybe he's a bit late.
- Train, that's right!

51
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,756
- Are you coming or not?
- OK. OK.

52
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,394
Robert, wait for us!

53
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,116
I'm sure we're going the right way.

54
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,196
How many times have you said that?

55
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,192
I still don't understand
why we had to leave home.

56
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,429
Jane,

57
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,353
we're going on a secret mission,
behind enemy lines.

58
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,432
The chances are that none of us
will make it back alive.

59
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,318
C YRIL: Oh, Robert. For goodness' sake.

60
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,231
They'll come at us with Zeppelins...

61
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,629
Oh, look, it's the house!

62
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,034
- Yes!
- We've arrived.

63
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,038
It's Uncle's castle. Come on, you two.

64
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,758
Oh, I'm soaked.

65
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,512
He's got a car.
Maybe he'll give you a go.

66
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,913
Good evening, madam.
We're looking for our Uncle Albert.

67
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,309
- We are...
- Five children! Oh, my goodness!

68
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,755
But you're not due till Friday.

69
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,068
Today is... Friday.

70
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,357
It is? I have a goose in the oven.
Goose is Thursdays.

71
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,309
Oh, never mind.

72
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,231
Come in. Come in. Come on.

73
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,708
Tuesday's duck, Wednesday's duck,
Thursday's goose.

74
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,915
Put your cases down.

75
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,319
It's duck, duck, goose.

76
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,233
We must have had Wednesday
on Tuesday and Monday on Sunday.

77
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,555
It's just one day, I suppose.

78
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,277
Last year, we lost October.

79
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,272
It's not an easy thing to do, you know,
lose a whole month.

80
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,238
I'll get you some towels
and tell your uncle you've arrived.

81
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,514
CHILDREN: Thank you.

82
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,797
<i>- What a dump.
It's scary.</i>

83
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,154
<i>I don't like it very much.</i>

84
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,949
I do, it's so Gothic,
just like the Castle Of Terror.

85
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,077
- It's like school. You'd love it, Cyril.
- What was that?

86
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,878
<i>Nothing.</i>

87
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,996
<i>What is this caterwauling and cacophony?</i>

88
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,196
<i>Rumbles and grumbles? Distant thunder?</i>

89
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,350
Warm air rising, cold front - boom.

90
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,398
Not expecting that, I dare say, hmm? What.

91
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,836
These are the children I was telling you about -
your nephews and nieces.

92
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,956
Impossible. Not due till Friday.

93
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,316
- Isn't that right, Horace?
- Yes, Father, not due till Friday.

94
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,356
<i>- Today is Friday.
Can't be.</i>

95
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,432
Smell that. That's Thursday.

96
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,556
<i>Uncle, it's me - CyriI.</i>

97
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,835
You came to my eighth birthday party.

98
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,639
You gave me a subscription to Algebra Monthly.

99
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,870
Cyril? Cyril!

100
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,269
No. Cyril was a much smaller boy.

101
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,998
But that was five years ago.

102
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,638
Was it?

103
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,473
Well, er... I should think
he'd be about your age by now.

104
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,755
I wonder what he's doing.

105
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,353
I can eat a whole goose by myself.

106
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,557
Well, if it is Friday, as you assert,
then goose was yesterday,

107
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,915
so you'll have to wait till um...

108
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,228
er... next Thursday.

109
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,949
<i>But there is a goose cooking
and today is Friday.</i>

110
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,397
Ah. Well, Martha...

111
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,793
Looks like Thursday's gone missing
with last October.

112
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,871
Well, well done. Thank you.

113
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,751
Oh... your father...

114
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,432
<i>.. top chap.</i>

115
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,237
Very brave.

116
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,113
Well, I'm off to unleash my thoughts
onto the page.

117
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,237
Many problems to solve.
History will be the judge.

118
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,750
- What was that?
- Children, I'll show you to your rooms.

119
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,193
- Anthea, is it?
- Yes.

120
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,669
Er... please, let me just take the little one.

121
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,671
Upsy. There we are.

122
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,796
You poor things. You must be so exhausted.

123
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,711
- Hello, Horace.
Hello.

124
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,430
I was taught never to talk to strangers.

125
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,511
But... we're your cousins.

126
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,151
Yes... but you're strange.

127
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,873
In the morning,
I'll give you a tour of the grounds.

128
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,872
You're allowed everywhere
except the greenhouse.

129
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,473
That's strictly off limits.

130
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,596
Why would a greenhouse be off limits?

131
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,753
Maybe the plants are deadly,
like in The Black Rose Of Devil's Island.

132
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,355
The greenhouse is off limits because I said it is.

133
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,115
So just stay out of it and everything will be fine.

134
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,077
Here we go.

135
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,680
<i>Look. It seems to have stopped drizzling...</i>

136
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,275
just in time for it to start raining... much harder.

137
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,954
- It could be worse.
- Let's have a little bit of music.

138
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,868
I knew I should have
hid that thing back at home.

139
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,272
Oh, no, there must be
a wounded cat in the room.

140
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,316
Jane, put that thing down and help me look.

141
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,992
<i>- Here, kitty.
C YRIL: Take that back.</i>

142
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,799
- You can't tell me what to do!
- I can and you know it.

143
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,751
I hate it here!

144
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,239
He doesn't mean it.

145
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,073
- He's just missing home.
- Am I that bad?

146
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,355
Be honest.

147
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,151
Take that back?

148
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,593
No chance.

149
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,189
What a place.

150
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,236
All summer?

151
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,436
I'll go mad, too.

152
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,279
Ah, children!
I expect you could do with a spot of lunch.

153
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,918
Come on, sit down, sit down.

154
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,037
First, second Saturday of the month,
all know what that means.

155
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:46,798
Second Saturday.
Statutes, laws, edicts, regulations... rules.

156
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,552
Exciting times, children.

157
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,757
A chance to grasp the goblet of goodness.

158
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,914
Ah, yes... rules. Delicious.

159
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,991
It doesn't look too bad.

160
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,195
Rule one.

161
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,113
No running in corridors.

162
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,713
<i>Rule two.</i>

163
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,234
<i>You will tidy your rooms
from top to bottom, side to side,</i>

164
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,788
<i>up and down, round and round,
and back to front.</i>

165
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,348
<i>Polish the woodwork, the paintwork,
and your homework.</i>

166
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,271
<i>Rule three.</i>

167
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,477
Laundry. Three times a week. Very important.

168
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,791
British Empire was built on clean pants.

169
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,190
- Er... clean pants and um...
- Mint sauce?

170
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,712
Don't be ridiculous, Horace.

171
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,273
<i>- Rule four. Never ever go into...
- The greenhouse.</i>

172
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,636
So, come on, don't delay,
don't dilly-dally, push on, go forth.

173
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,556
Wait! One more rule.

174
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,120
The alpha and omega - be all and end all.

175
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,671
I am writing a book. Difficult Sums For Children.

176
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,038
Therefore, in this house, absolute silence.

177
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,315
Do not bring down...

178
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,752
<i>.. the dragon's wrath.</i>

179
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,632
Now...

180
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,837
did Martha say that we were not to go in here...

181
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,877
<i>.. or that... we were not to miss going in here?</i>

182
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,599
She wasn't very clear.

183
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,109
<i>Grapes!</i>

184
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,229
Great!

185
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,117
Laundry...

186
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,031
These rules are mad.

187
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,678
Yes.

188
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,431
We're never going to get through this.

189
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,238
Not if there were 100 of us.

190
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,719
Look how long it is.

191
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,398
Where do you think Uncle keeps
his really big hammers?

192
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,950
What?

193
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,397
Robert, this is the one room
we were told not to go in. Come back.

194
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,833
What's that?

195
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,629
<i>- I said, this is the one room...
- I can't hear a word you're saying.</i>

196
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,280
Robert, stop fooling around.
Come here. Come here!

197
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,239
You were saying something
about not being in the greenhouse?

198
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,630
Yes, Cyril. So, can we come in, too?

199
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,439
All right. All right, just don't touch anything.

200
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,713
- Over here. Look.
- What is it now?

201
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,756
But it's locked.

202
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,239
Is it?

203
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,517
- I wonder what's behind it.
- I don't.

204
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,034
- Let me borrow that hammer.
- Forget it.

205
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,758
We're guests, not burglars.

206
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,752
Besides, I'm sure there's a good reason
why the door's locked.

207
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,796
- Anyone for grapes?
- Yes, please!

208
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,031
<i>No wonder Martha didn't want us in here.</i>

209
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,997
<i>Look at it. It's a mess.</i>

210
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,359
<i>- Jane.
- Thank you.</i>

211
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,750
<i>Catch. CyriI!</i>

212
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,474
- Very nice.
- How did he do that?

213
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,755
Who cares?

214
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,673
Let's explore.

215
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,433
Where's the Lamb?

216
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,238
Come on.

217
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,312
Come on, Cyril.
It's either this or laundry.

218
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,910
In for a penny...

219
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,954
It's wonderful. I wonder where it leads.

220
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,837
It's so dark in here.

221
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,673
We turn back if we see anything creepy-crawly.

222
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,479
- Agreed?
- OK. Agreed.

223
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,073
<i>I wonder where this leads?</i>

224
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,754
<i>There was a tunneI like this
in The Maze Of Molidor.</i>

225
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:21,311
<i>It's where Bertram the Bold encounters
a giant nine-legged, talking spider.</i>

226
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,470
How horrible.

227
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,710
<i>C YRIL: Well, I think that's ridiculous.</i>

228
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,916
<i>Everybody knows spiders have eight legs.</i>

229
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,551
<i>I don't like it in here.</i>

230
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,957
Cyril, maybe we'll find a sunken ship.
Or buried treasure.

231
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,793
<i>- Or maybe even... a dead body.
- Oh.</i>

232
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,314
- Robert!
- Let's hope we can find our way back.

233
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,510
Come on. I can see light.

234
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,068
I can see the sea up ahead. It's not raining.

235
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,916
- It's beautiful.
C YRIL: Robert, wait.

236
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,036
- Look at it.
- Anthea.

237
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,159
Beautiful.

238
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,550
Where are we? What happened to the rain?

239
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,791
<i>CyriI, come here, look at this.</i>

240
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,118
- What is it?
- Right...

241
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,158
this is uncharted territory,
so we have to be careful.

242
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,993
- No-one do anything...
- Yeah, yeah. You're it!

243
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,274
- Yes!
Robert!

244
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,554
<i>.. rash.</i>

245
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,790
<i>- Robert!
- Amazing!</i>

246
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,195
Fantastic! Yes!

247
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,791
C YRIL: Robert!

248
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,117
Ooh!

249
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,474
Whoa!

250
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,678
Yes!

251
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,431
You shouldn't have eaten those grapes.

252
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,192
It wasn't me. It was...

253
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,474
It was it.

254
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,915
- Help me lift it out.
- What?

255
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,951
<i>- Lift this out.
What is it?</i>

256
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,828
It looks like an old turtle shell.

257
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,233
I can hear it breathing.

258
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,436
- Something's inside it.
- It's alive!

259
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,748
Hey...

260
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,308
- Come on.
- I'm not sure...

261
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,799
Oh, come on.

262
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,199
This could be dangerous.

263
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,793
Robert.

264
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,673
I think it's asleep.

265
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,274
Look, whatever it is,
we don't want to wake it up.

266
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,635
It spoke. How scary.

267
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,153
It couldn't have.

268
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,673
One, two, three...

269
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,350
Yes, there it is again.

270
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,158
What's it saying?

271
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,992
It sounded like, "Shove off. "

272
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,116
- Hello?
- Do you want to lose your nose?

273
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,316
It could be a giant talking crab.

274
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,355
Oh.

275
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,316
Look! A lobster.

276
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,959
- After it!
- Don't touch it!

277
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,156
I don't know why I said lobster.

278
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,800
On this beach, just over there!

279
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,029
Come here!

280
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,959
- Stay back!
- Aghh!

281
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,952
You have to stop talking to it.
It could be dangerous.

282
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,350
I bet it has huge fangs
and poisonous saliva.

283
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,351
<i>- It's an ugly little monster.
- "It"?</i>

284
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,072
It? It?

285
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,470
Do you mean to tell me you
do not know what a Psammead is?

286
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,913
You're a what?

287
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,235
I am a Psammead crustacea
decapodlium wishasaurus.

288
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,594
Got it?

289
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,635
No.

290
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,757
I am a Sand-fairy.

291
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,796
- Sand-fairy?
- Yeah.

292
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,793
I thought fairies had little ballet dresses
and wings and wands.

293
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,155
What on earth have you been reading?

294
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,878
I'll call you Sandy.

295
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,235
<i>- Why?
- Because we found you in the sand.</i>

296
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,596
You're so funny.
Have your parents tried boiling you?

297
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,318
That's it. Come on.

298
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,118
<i>- Don't like that "boiling" line, do you?
- Robert, now!</i>

299
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,156
<i>Kids don't like that.</i>

300
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,559
<i>- Off you go...
- Come here.</i>

301
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,916
Did you know
that fairies in books can grant wishes?

302
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,788
All right, all right. I will grant you your wishes.

303
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,677
But... I have a list of demands.

304
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,877
My needs are minimal
but what I need is a state room,

305
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,997
with a sunken bath and those taps
that go backwards and forwards.

306
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,119
And I need a toothbrush made of gold.
Not the bristles, but the bit you hold.

307
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,792
Gold bristles would hurt my gums.

308
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,233
<i>Did that once.</i>

309
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,599
Anyway, I'd like white sand spread on the floor,
preferably sand from the Bahamas.

310
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,638
- And a shower cap.
- The thing is, we don't have a palace.

311
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,870
- And a yak.
- Or any of those other things.

312
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,952
We're the Butterworths.
All we have is a small house in London.

313
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,156
- We're just children.
- Make a wish anyway.

314
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,913
- I wish...
- Stop.

315
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,231
You've started a wish. You can't stop now.

316
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,356
¶ Make a wish, make a wish...

317
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,429
On second thoughts,

318
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,432
we're going to leave this little man
and go back to the house.

319
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,670
We've still got Uncle's list to get through.

320
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,832
Oh, great idea. Let's go and tidy up for 14 hours.

321
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,071
- That's it.
¶ Ba-dup, bo-dup, ba-da ba-da

322
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,195
Sand-fairy.

323
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,316
<i>- Are you still here?
- Yes.</i>

324
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,879
- And we wish...
- Anthea!

325
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,715
We wish for all the tasks on Uncle's list
to be done by magic.

326
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,994
OK.

327
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,993
So, you want me to give you...
extra hands?

328
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,196
No!

329
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,111
<i>Here we go.</i>

330
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,834
Was that it?

331
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,512
Yeah, good, eh?

332
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,515
Quick! Come on, let's see if it worked.

333
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,639
Let's go!

334
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,473
Anthea, how did you get here so fast?

335
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,277
- Anthea?
- Yes?

336
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,678
You'll never guess what's in our...

337
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,914
Ah.

338
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,797
I don't believe it.

339
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,912
Come on. Come on!

340
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,151
Do you realise what this means?

341
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,913
We'll never have to work again. We're free.

342
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,551
Jane?

343
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,590
Wishes. Real wishes. We made a wish...

344
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,557
and it came true.

345
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,153
It's not supposed to happen.

346
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,435
She's right, you know. This is big.

347
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,873
It's huge.

348
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,589
<i>It's immense. It's monumentally,
colossally ginormous.</i>

349
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,319
- Is that even a word?
- Apparently it is now.

350
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,631
I hate to do this, but it's for your own good.

351
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,630
Stop!

352
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,869
Horace is coming.

353
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,997
You have to distract him.
Quickly, go! Quick!

354
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,868
Well, it's you, you horrible little child.
Shouldn't you be cleaning my room?

355
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,315
Horace, it's time we got to know one another.

356
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,549
No, it isn't.

357
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,108
I used to think that myself, but here we are.

358
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,189
I'll start.

359
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,352
Oh, great.

360
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,191
Just what my day was missing.

361
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,510
A tour of a dark, smelly basement.

362
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,989
This is where I keep my monster collection.

363
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,356
What's that noise?

364
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,396
I don't know.

365
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,276
Be careful. Don't get too close.
You might get savaged.

366
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,794
By a dead starfish with an onion stuck on it.

367
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,759
It's not. It's called Megastarrium
and it's a monster. They're all monsters.

368
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,955
Look.

369
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,110
Ooh, that was scary - very scary.

370
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,669
- Oh, no! It's me.
- This is not good.

371
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,990
If Uncle hears it, we're for it.

372
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,514
Here. Wait there.

373
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,919
I'll try and distract him.

374
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,436
I was hoping you could teach me
the more finer points of monster er...

375
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,714
Monster mastery?

376
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,268
- Please.
- You're in for a treat.

377
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,070
Who dares sally forth
to the dragon's lair?

378
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,832
It's Cyril, Uncle.

379
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,239
Yes, Cyril. Mm.

380
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,878
Yeah, popular name these days.

381
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,111
Seems every other boy I meet
is called Squirrel - Cyril. Cyril!

382
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,917
I've come to see what you're writing.

383
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,319
Really?

384
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,356
I like to do sums.

385
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,793
- The harder, the better.
- Plucky chap! Come in.

386
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,517
Let us make maths your mistress.
Ignite the mind.

387
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,276
I am going to set you the most
difficult sum you have ever seen.

388
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,874
Exciting, eh? It's here... somewhere.

389
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,393
Ahh...

390
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,109
Ooh.

391
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,478
I know how you feel.

392
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,311
It's beautiful, isn't it?

393
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,152
There's no need to rush.

394
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,639
Enjoy.

395
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,188
Savour the sum.

396
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,316
Let it wash over you.

397
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,673
And once you gain its trust...
it's yours for life.

398
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,990
- Are you the real Anthea?
- Yes.

399
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,116
At least, I think so.

400
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,679
Shrieking?

401
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,193
Screeching?

402
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,635
Ahh, nails down the blackboard?

403
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,432
The dragon awakes.

404
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,238
Uncle, no!

405
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,828
Whoever is making that noise...

406
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,558
Well, then, minus 82...

407
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,551
<i>.. dire consequences!</i>

408
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,555
Come on, Cyril, think!

409
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:33,356
<i>.. the cosine rule will come into action,
meaning that the 86 is totally irrelevant.</i>

410
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,112
Ah!

411
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,873
3,465,222.

412
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,155
Say that again.

413
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,714
3,465,222.

414
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,076
A prime number of the Zeeman series.

415
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,993
Toppety-notchety work, Squirrel - Cyril.

416
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,274
<i>It's my favourite series,</i>

417
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,158
although the Flugelstadt Succession
runs it a close second.

418
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,992
I'll show you Dr Flugelstadt's book.

419
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,150
He went mad, you know, completely bonkers.

420
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,959
Lost his marbles. Fell out of his tree. Oak, I think.

421
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,792
Ah, now, wait.

422
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,711
What's this one?

423
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,836
No, wait! Don't tell me.

424
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,519
Eggasaurus.

425
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,272
No. Tyrannosaurus.

426
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,748
Come on, you two.

427
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,879
If we start now, we might be able
to finish by... next Tuesday.

428
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,359
Just look at this place.

429
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,670
How are we going to pay for the damage?

430
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,398
It's not too bad.

431
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,311
I mean, it's just...

432
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,198
these plates... and that clock...

433
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,872
<i>.. this vase...</i>

434
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,598
How expensive do you think
a Ming vase would be?

435
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,989
I know. We don't have to buy anything.

436
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,753
We can wish
for the things to be fixed good as new.

437
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,876
<i>Well, now.</i>

438
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,269
What a to-do today turned out to be.

439
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,998
Oh... it wasn't us.

440
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,719
- Honestly, it was the Sand-fairy...
- Jane.

441
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,109
<i>- Sand-fairy, huh?
Er...</i>

442
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,875
No, she didn't say "Sand-fairy", she said...

443
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,712
She said...

444
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,633
Safari. We were pretending to be on safari,

445
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,551
and Cyril is an elephant.

446
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,916
A safari, of course.

447
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,594
Well, now, if we all do as I do...

448
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,672
we can undo all this to-do before tomorrow.

449
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,239
Come along, you lot.

450
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,113
<i>Dear Mummy,</i>

451
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,112
<i>should Uncle's letter reach you
before this one does,</i>

452
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,352
<i>Robert says breakages are inevitable,
under the circumstances.</i>

453
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,793
<i>Anyway, it is only the second week,</i>

454
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,075
<i>and we've already found
an amazing beach,</i>

455
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,550
<i>and we found a... found a strange thing.</i>

456
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,279
<i>But it is nearly bedtime.</i>

457
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,237
<i>So, no more from me tonight.</i>

458
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,031
<i>Your loving daughter, Jane.</i>

459
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,837
<i>PS. If you could have a wish come true,</i>

460
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,990
<i>what would you have?</i>

461
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,233
- Bacon?
- Yes, please.

462
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,517
- The Supersaurus was 200 feet high!
- I know that.

463
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,477
<i>But if you want to see a reaI monster...</i>

464
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,437
Ow! What was that for?

465
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,318
- Boiled egg, Jane?
- Mm. Yes, please.

466
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,472
Thank you. Ooh!

467
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,232
What did you two get up to yesterday?

468
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,231
Horace showed me his laboratory.

469
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,072
And his collection of monsters.

470
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,071
<i>He's got dozens pickled in jars.</i>

471
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:35,436
- Eugh, that's really disgusting.
- Most of them were rubbish.

472
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,034
- Hey!
- But he has a dinosaur in an egg!

473
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:41,476
That's a secret.
Now you have to tell me a secret of yours.

474
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,916
<i>Well... yester...
- Robert! Robert, no. Come here.</i>

475
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,592
Hey!

476
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,039
<i>Put me down!</i>

477
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,314
Hey, get off. What are you playing at?

478
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,157
You're bound to mention It.

479
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,719
- So?
- It's our secret.

480
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,916
And Horace is so nasty.

481
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,117
He's odd, but he's not so bad
when you get to know him.

482
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,713
And he has his own laboratory.

483
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,155
Where he collects monsters
and pickles them in jars?

484
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,071
- Yes.
- Think what he'd do to It.

485
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,628
Er... yes. Good point.

486
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,598
Don't mention It in front of the pickler.

487
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,195
What are you whispering about?
And what's It?

488
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,998
- Ah... well...
- Er...

489
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,229
It...

490
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,834
It's a game of hide-and-seek. You're it.

491
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,753
You count to a thousand while we hide.

492
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,070
A thousand? Isn't it usually 20?

493
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,914
<i>Well, it's such a big house
and Jane and I are only girls...</i>

494
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,877
Oh, fine.

495
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,030
One, two, three...

496
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,792
<i>I hated saying, "We are only girls. "</i>

497
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,632
- Where are you going?
- Here's a clue.

498
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,154
<i>- It rhymes with "hand hairy".
C YRIL: Oh, no.</i>

499
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,753
No way. We're not going back.

500
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,274
You saw all the trouble that wish got us into.

501
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,477
Oh, look, this must be the pole
that's been sticking up Cyril's...

502
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,199
Back off! You can insult me all you like, but...

503
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,077
Thanks, but I'll save that for later.

504
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,230
I'm going, whether you're coming or not.

505
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,591
Hand hairy...?

506
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,671
Hand hairy?

507
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,917
Sand-fairy.

508
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,231
Oh, pendulous expression,
furrowed brow - bad news?

509
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,108
- This letter from your publisher.
- Yes, yes. Immaterial.

510
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,679
Impact inconsequential.

511
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,671
They want to make big changes to your book.

512
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,875
- They do?
- Yes.

513
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,633
Difficult Sums For Children isn't catchy enough.

514
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,109
- Catchy?
- They're suggesting a new title.

515
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,919
Counting The Fun With Charlie Chicken.

516
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,230
They're replacing you with a chicken.

517
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,197
- Ridiculous.
- Of course it is.

518
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,793
We must write back and tell them.

519
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,440
Give me the name of the chicken
and the address of his coop.

520
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,637
No, no, your publishers.
You can't have a counting chicken.

521
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,109
Of course not. Can't count without fingers.

522
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,316
No use. Oh, I suppose he could use wings.

523
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,470
No, that's silly. He'd only get to two.

524
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,437
Unless... er...

525
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,476
Noah managed two by two.

526
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,028
Gosh, that flood must have been
a terrible setback.

527
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,792
Ahh.

528
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,915
Hm-hm.

529
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,832
Smells like rain. Great change is afoot.

530
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,319
You can sign this one.

531
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,794
It! It!

532
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,519
So, have you come to thank me
for yesterday's wish?

533
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,875
- I brought you these.
- Ah.

534
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,916
Forget it. How kind.

535
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,956
That hole doesn't look very comfortable.

536
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,429
- Yes, it is.
- Would you like to sit next to me?

537
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,988
Like Flopsy. He's my rabbit.

538
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,196
- You have a rabbit called Flopsy?
- Mm.

539
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,111
Has he got no spine?

540
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,033
Your ability with naming things
is not very good, child.

541
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,997
Oh, here they all come. Hmm.

542
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,116
Our wish didn't turn out as we expected.

543
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,269
No.

544
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,716
Yes. Our doubles turned the hall
into a swimming pool.

545
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,109
Was anything damaged?

546
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,316
- Damaged? It was an absolute mess!
- Huh? Plenty.

547
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,551
- The vases smashed to smithereens?
- Yes.

548
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,949
The floor flooded, and dictionaries drenched?

549
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,349
They were.

550
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,271
<i>And the house burnt to the ground?</i>

551
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,238
- No.
- House didn't burn to the ground?

552
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,629
You got off lightly, all things considered.

553
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,675
What?

554
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,713
Not so fast, Sand-fairy!

555
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,439
You made those doubles
ruin the house on purpose.

556
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,272
Look, it's not me. It's the rules.

557
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,271
You make a wish, it goes horribly wrong.

558
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,148
And then you learn something valuable. Hmm?

559
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,152
That's terrible. I don't need to learn anything.

560
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,275
Ooh!

561
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,158
Of course,
everything is back to normal by sunset.

562
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,389
Why "of course"?

563
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,472
Because wishes only last
during the daylight.

564
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,710
So that's why our doubles disappeared.

565
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,712
- Why didn't you tell us that?
- You didn't ask.

566
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,360
- So, can you fix everything we broke?
- Oh, yes.

567
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,074
- But they'll be broken again by sunset.
- Oh, great.

568
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,798
<i>- It's got a point.
- Mmm.</i>

569
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,678
So what you learn from this,
you see, is... Hello.

570
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,954
What do you think?

571
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,316
Ah, well... very good. I like er...

572
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,755
the use of light and shadow, it's very effective.

573
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,952
The subject is hideous monster, of course.

574
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,112
As the sun here melts,
the monster, he is shocked.

575
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,634
His hair's on end and...

576
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,676
<i>Oh, it's me.</i>

577
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,036
I know. Let's ask for money.
We can pay to get everything fixed.

578
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,237
<i>Let's not go crazy.
Just enough to cover the breakages.</i>

579
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,754
<i>- I think we should ask for gold.
Yes!</i>

580
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,990
<i>- I wish we had buckets of it.
C YRIL: Robert!</i>

581
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,911
So, buckets of gold.

582
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,432
398... 399...

583
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,238
400...

584
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,037
999...

585
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,951
1,000.

586
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,075
Ready or not, here I come!

587
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,436
<i>- I said let's not go crazy.
Oh, shut up.</i>

588
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,872
- Hurry up.
C YRIL: It's stuck.

589
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,996
Push it harder, Cyril.

590
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,991
- Push!
- Push.

591
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,991
Ohh...

592
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,671
Buckets of the stuff!

593
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,836
<i>Hello?</i>

594
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,552
It's Horace.

595
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,596
Oh, no, he mustn't see the gold.

596
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,557
<i>I can hear you.</i>

597
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,949
<i>Come out, come out, wherever you are!</i>

598
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,357
You can't hide for ever, you know.

599
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,352
Aha! I found you!

600
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,158
I win, I win, I win, I win!

601
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,356
New game. You're it.

602
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,115
Oh, come on. Don't be sore losers.

603
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,351
Er... new rules.
The winner gets a head start.

604
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,678
- That's right.
- Yes.

605
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,317
OK. Fine.

606
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,637
<i>Come on! Hurry up!</i>

607
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,109
<i>Anthea, we're going! Come on!</i>

608
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,111
<i>Just wait for us.</i>

609
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,598
Come on, Lamb.
C YRIL: Come on. Keep up.

610
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,193
<i>Are you OK with Lamb, Anthea?</i>

611
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,748
- Have you got the list?
- Yes, Cyril.

612
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,795
Good.

613
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,031
When we get into town,
we're going to the antique shop.

614
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,157
Yes, Cyril.
- We'll go straight in and straight out.

615
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,471
Yes, Cyril.
- We won't get distracted by anything.

616
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,755
- Got it?
Yes, Cyril.

617
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,593
Thank you.

618
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,710
Come on. We're here to buy vases,
not ice creams.

619
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,994
Let's buy the vase.

620
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,230
- Five cones with all the trimmings.
- Robert!

621
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:51,393
- Keep the change.
- What's a child doing with all this gold?

622
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,869
- It must be fake.
- No, it's not, is it?

623
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,076
- We made a wish...
- We didn't, Jane.

624
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,791
Old Blighty! Old Blighty!

625
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,549
No, he's taking back the vase.

626
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,950
- It was just like the one that broke.
- He doesn't want to take the gold.

627
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,835
Wha...?

628
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,631
Not again. Not...

629
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,280
Your country needs you!

630
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,917
Dad! Dad!

631
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,396
Sorry, lad.

632
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,680
- I thought...
- It's OK.

633
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,554
It's all right.

634
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,598
You know what we need?
To fill our faces. What do you say?

635
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,399
But the ice-cream man...
He didn't want our money.

636
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,755
Neither did the man in the antique shop.

637
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,594
There must be someone
willing to take a heap of gold,

638
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,557
no questions asked.

639
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,230
- Look at that one.
- It's nice, isn't it?

640
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,596
Cyril!

641
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,875
He's trying to say something.

642
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,598
Cyril?

643
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,910
<i>It's the car- something to do with the car.</i>

644
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,076
<i>C YRIL: That's not a car.</i>

645
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,789
That is the Portman Speedster 3000.

646
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,598
According to Motorcar Monthly,

647
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,719
the 3000 is the fastest production motor
of all time.

648
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,472
We're talking eight horsepower.

649
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,074
If it's so wonderful, why don't you just buy it?

650
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,276
- Yeah, buy the car, Cyril!
- Buy the car!

651
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,191
- No.
- Buy the car! Come on!

652
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,679
Stop it!

653
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,951
Don't step on my floor.

654
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,634
I need to speak to my father.
Get out of my way.

655
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,508
Oh, well, it must be very important
if you want to disturb him at work.

656
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,556
It's about those children.

657
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,074
Oh, really? And what children would you mean?

658
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,639
My cousins.

659
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,034
Broom-broom.

660
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,157
<i>CyriI, this one goes 80mph.
Dad would love this.</i>

661
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,832
Get off, get off, get off!

662
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,070
- We were just...
- Shh.

663
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,310
I beg your pardon!

664
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,310
Eh?

665
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,755
We would like to buy a motorcar.

666
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,355
- That one over there.
- Of course, sir.

667
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,112
And perhaps sir would like to take

668
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,237
the aforementioned automobile for a test drive.

669
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,993
- Great idea.
- Just a small matter of a deposit...

670
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,632
<i>- .. in case of misadventure.
- Ours are always misadventures.</i>

671
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,153
I daresay.

672
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,117
This enough?

673
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,675
Yes.

674
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,480
- I didn't know Cyril could drive.
- He can't.

675
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,516
Come on!

676
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,718
<i>On the left!</i>

677
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,794
<i>- Look out!
- Whoa!</i>

678
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,232
I can't see!

679
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:19,956
Help!

680
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,191
Stop this car!

681
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,838
Stop! Ahh!

682
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,835
Oh...

683
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,558
- Thanks for the test drive.
But I don't think he likes it.

684
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,119
- Wait...
C YRIL: Quick.

685
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,269
Halt!

686
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,790
- You'll pay for this, you little...
- Good afternoon.

687
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,472
Sergeant...

688
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,437
Just the man.

689
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:01,273
These hooligans have wrecked my motorcar.

690
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,955
- This one here was driving like a...
- A child?

691
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,190
Behind the wheel of your motorcar?

692
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,157
Eh? Er...

693
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,117
Children...

694
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,154
Well, this one here, he swore he was 27.

695
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,470
He's got a wife and three kids in Winchester.

696
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,834
<i>But I'm 11!</i>

697
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,638
Yeah, yeah, you and your gold!

698
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,597
Nice lot you are.

699
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,797
Tempting honest car dealers
with your stolen gold.

700
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,309
That's enough. These children are with me.

701
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,277
Oh, an accomplice, I'll wager.

702
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:36,070
I don't think they're going to
wriggle out of this one. Allow me.

703
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,275
Gone!

704
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,191
Come along, Mr Peasemarsh.

705
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,918
It's gone!

706
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,198
I'm sure there's a good explanation
for this but we'll have to go down...

707
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,840
I was going to be a policeman.
Never had the feet.

708
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,469
Horace, I trust this isn't a prank.
I'm in the middle of chapter 12-

709
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,472
The Joy Of Quadratic Equations.
I'm at the good bit.

710
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,711
No, it's true.
The children, the gold and the greenhouse.

711
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,153
I have them.

712
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,913
Will they be sentenced to 20 years hard labour?

713
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,797
- What the...?
- But...

714
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,790
Ah!

715
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,314
Convicts on the loose. Alert the authorities!

716
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,154
Unusual hour.

717
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,879
Nocturnal excursion... dishevelled youngsters...

718
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,996
Ripe odour.

719
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,958
Odd situation. Martha, explain.

720
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,758
We were taking the dog for a walk.

721
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,035
- Isn't that right, children?
- Yes, Martha.

722
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,270
Ah, the howl of the hounds!

723
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,635
Running with the pack
of an autumn morning, eh?

724
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,075
Fresh air, waggedy tails, eh?
Bow-wow-wow.

725
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,469
How much is that doggie in the um...?

726
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,597
- But we don't have a dog.
- Use your imagination, Horace.

727
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,352
The gold.

728
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,271
Ah, the gold coins. Nobody move.

729
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,390
Horace... Horace!

730
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,631
You're becoming eccentric.

731
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,834
Come along, children.

732
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,793
You may be able to fool my father,

733
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,155
but I've enough proof to send you to prison.

734
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,276
For the rest of your lives.

735
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,669
Phew.

736
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,512
What a day it's been.

737
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,353
- It could've been worse.
- Worse?

738
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,749
How? You keep getting us into trouble.

739
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,432
Stop picking on me.

740
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,512
Besides, it didn't take long
to get you behind the wheel.

741
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,238
Why do you have to be such a pain?

742
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,231
Why do you have to boss everyone about?

743
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,231
You think you're grown-up but you're not.

744
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,356
Stop it! Don't fight.

745
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,475
Please.

746
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,677
I was put in charge.

747
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,718
- It doesn't mean I have to listen to you.
- Yes, it does!

748
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,677
- No, it doesn't!
- Yes, it does!

749
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,637
You're not Dad.

750
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,397
<i>Hello?</i>

751
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,357
Well, well, well, well, well now.

752
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,317
What's all this commotion?

753
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,231
So many sad faces.

754
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,511
Well, I may have something
that might cheer you up.

755
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,431
A little bit of magic.

756
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,556
No more magic, please.

757
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,790
Abra Chihuahua!

758
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,677
Let me see. Let me see.

759
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,036
- It's addressed to all of us!
- I recognise the writing. It's Dad's.

760
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,997
Open it, Cyril. Go on, you have to.

761
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,355
In all the kerfuffle, I almost forgot.

762
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,237
"My darling children,

763
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:30,596
I hope you are all happy, healthy,
and up to plenty of mischief

764
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,955
and soaking up all the joys of the country. "

765
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,917
He's got the soaking part right.

766
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:35,671
Sh.

767
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,911
<i>"Jane, I hope you are enjoying your violin.</i>

768
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,877
However hard it is to learn now,

769
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,076
it's something you'll be glad of one day.

770
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:48,469
Anthea, I'm thoroughly enjoying
the novel you hid in my luggage.

771
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,437
<i>The Plummeting Pilot Of Poslewait.</i>

772
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,398
<i>All the boys in the squadron
are lining up to borrow it.</i>

773
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,675
<i>And, Robert...</i>

774
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,797
the Sopwith's a bit tricky in the air,
but she's a beauty.

775
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,757
I wish I could fly over to see you.

776
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,677
Let's all hope it won't be long.

777
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,159
And, Cyril...

778
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,435
these are difficult days for us all.

779
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,317
But I know I can count on you.

780
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,999
Whatever happens,
you must stand by one another.

781
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,355
<i>Now, give the Lamb a big kiss from me.</i>

782
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,879
I'd better grab some shuteye
as I am on dawn patrol.

783
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,356
All my love always,

784
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,317
Dad. "

785
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,910
Read it again, Cyril.

786
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,792
<i>Martha?</i>

787
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,314
Unexpected guest just arrived.

788
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,278
On a flying visit, I suppose.
I didn't know about this.

789
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,759
A guest, sir?

790
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,717
Yes.

791
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,553
Professor Charles Chicken,
University of Eggsford.

792
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,995
I was at Eggsford.
I don't remember a Chicken.

793
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,957
It's from your publisher.

794
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:13,157
They propose giving away
one free puppet with every book.

795
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,071
One free with every book?

796
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:18,152
- Ridiculous. That'll never catch on.
- That's what I said.

797
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,150
Chicken!

798
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,117
Huh!

799
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,350
C YRIL: Today's a new day, a fresh start.

800
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,317
Are we making another wish?

801
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,231
Not a chance.

802
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,275
What?

803
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,237
Cyril and I have been discussing it,

804
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:33,437
and we've agreed from now on,
we leave the Sand-fairy alone.

805
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,397
But I drew it another picture. Look.

806
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,357
We can't leave it alone.

807
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,000
Think of all the wishes we'd be giving up.

808
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,957
No more wishes. It's over.

809
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,871
Promise me, Robert. Please.

810
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,235
All right. All right, I promise.

811
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,914
<i>So what do we do instead?</i>

812
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,877
We'll make friends with Horace.

813
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,837
- Why?
- Why not?

814
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,751
Because he's so nasty.

815
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,711
Excellent!

816
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,271
Who's there?

817
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,237
C YRIL: Hello, Horace.
GIRLS: Hello.

818
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,237
Oh, it's you lot.

819
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,959
C YRIL: We've come to see
if you'd like to play with us.

820
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,759
So you can have another game
of hide-and-seek and run off?

821
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,717
We're sorry about that.

822
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,637
So what do you say?

823
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,757
How about we make a picnic
and go down to the sea?

824
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,711
<i>Oh, I wish I could.</i>

825
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,633
I really, really do. The truth is...

826
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,359
- I don't like you.
- But we want to be your friends.

827
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,317
<i>I don't need friends.</i>

828
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:51,032
But I do need test subjects for my experiments.

829
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,155
Eugh! Horace, don't be silly.

830
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,549
- Put that down. Put that down.
- Make me.

831
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,471
Horace, put those down.

832
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,957
Quick!

833
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,793
This is going well.
Do you think he's our friend yet?

834
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,393
I don't know.

835
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,476
I know you've got a secret,
and when I catch you, I'll get it.

836
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,077
Oh, what's going on here?

837
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,634
Just playing with the other children, Martha.

838
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,870
That's good. Good boy, Horace. Carry on.

839
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,197
Up here, quick!

840
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,474
Brilliant.

841
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,916
C YRIL: Think we're OK?
Yes.

842
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,433
You do, do you?

843
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,829
<i>If you don't let me in on your little secret,</i>

844
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,797
<i>I won't let you out.</i>

845
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,392
We're trapped.

846
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,357
No, we can't be.

847
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,197
I wonder what happened to Robert.

848
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,397
I need a longer pin.

849
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,637
I might have something.

850
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:49,597
What about this?

851
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,759
Here.

852
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,353
Great.

853
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,997
Oh, my gosh!

854
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,672
I've got wings!

855
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,637
<i>So soft.</i>

856
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,631
So white.

857
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,278
Wow!

858
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:12,154
- The little...
- What?

859
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,037
He must have made a wish.

860
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:17,078
The boy is out of control.
I don't know how I'll cope.

861
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:19,594
What am I going to tell Mum? Look at you!

862
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,033
<i>CyriI!</i>

863
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,758
Cyril! Cyril!

864
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,717
You've done it again!

865
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,916
What on earth were you thinking?

866
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,911
I'm going to France to see Dad.

867
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,877
France?

868
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,315
He wished he could fly to see us,
well, he can't.

869
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,277
But we can fly to him. Come on!

870
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,311
Robert, no!

871
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,278
This way. Just try and catch me!

872
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,157
Anthea, wait!

873
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,832
Please, wait for me!

874
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,674
- Come on, Jane.
- Anthea, wait for me!

875
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,037
Huh.

876
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,796
Robert!

877
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,077
<i>This is amazing!</i>

878
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,231
Let's get Robert.

879
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,830
Look!

880
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,319
Aargh!

881
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,077
<i>.. wieso wir gehört haben.</i>

882
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,837
Let's get going!

883
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,112
<i>Wait for me!</i>

884
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,156
Wait for me! No!

885
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:22,070
Much against my better nature,
I have decided to let you...

886
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,037
out.

887
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:35,997
<i>Yoo-hoo!</i>

888
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,799
Children! Where are you, dears?

889
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:44,552
Ah, Horace. Have you seen your cousins?

890
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,550
No.

891
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,915
The only rational conclusion is,

892
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,230
they flew out the window.

893
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,031
C YRIL: What were you thinking?

894
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,429
- We could have been killed!
- I want to see Dad!

895
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,397
France is just a few miles that way.

896
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,993
Too dangerous!

897
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,752
And too late.

898
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,956
We have to get back. Now!

899
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,591
- I'm going down.
- No, you're not.

900
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,557
Keep up with me.

901
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,592
Come in, all of you.

902
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,557
Here you are, Robert.

903
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,312
There you are. Good heavens.

904
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,277
Look at the state of you. Filthy.

905
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,677
I think I landed on Uncle's roses.

906
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,830
He's going to be so angry.

907
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,797
Come here, children.

908
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,677
Come here.

909
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,637
Now, I'm sure that all will be well.

910
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,553
Er... we must hope... we must believe...

911
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,914
Mummy!

912
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,831
- I can't believe you're here!
- Mum!

913
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,115
- I didn't know you were coming.
- Mummy.

914
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:13,357
- Did you get our letter?
- Yes, I did, precious.

915
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,192
Something's wrong.

916
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,037
- It's your father.
- He's here?

917
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,678
<i>No, Robert, he's not.</i>

918
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,870
His plane went down behind enemy lines.

919
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,837
Several days ago.

920
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,717
He's missing.

921
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:27,835
No.

922
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,275
<i>It's not true.</i>

923
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,917
Where is it? I've got it right here!

924
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,029
Robert?

925
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:48,759
- It's gone!
- What have you lost?

926
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,798
The compass.
I left it in my drawer but it's not here.

927
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,757
It'll turn up. Come here.

928
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,956
You don't have to worry. Dad's all right.

929
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,031
- Yes.
- No, really. He isn't missing.

930
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,997
He can't be.

931
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:02,719
He must be on a secret mission
behind enemy lines.

932
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,677
It's all right to be upset.

933
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:08,634
I'm not upset. I have to go now.

934
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,597
We have to help Dad.

935
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,318
Look, I know...

936
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,992
I know you want to.

937
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,548
But we just have to wait for news.

938
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:20,789
Wait?

939
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,075
- Yeah, I'm sure everything...
- Wait?

940
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,037
Robert, I...

941
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:31,197
Please be here.

942
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,157
Please, Sand-fairy.

943
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,117
Please.

944
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,157
Why have you woken me?

945
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,679
I lost something.

946
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,149
Well, did you, indeed? Something precious?

947
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,196
And you think I can help you to find it?

948
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,157
With a wish.

949
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,912
Well, of course.

950
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,752
- I wish...
- No, stop.

951
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,717
You've had all your wishes today.

952
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,553
I gave you all wings.
That's not easy to do, you know.

953
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,517
Wings is a big job.

954
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,591
You might show some gratitude.

955
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,477
I'm very grateful.

956
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,357
But, Sand-fairy...

957
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,271
I do need this wish.

958
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,715
Well, all right, I can grant your wish.

959
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,268
But when dawn comes, not before.

960
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,351
- But you'll do it?
- Yes.

961
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,271
But, child, what then?

962
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,351
The wish will fade at sunset, you know.

963
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,193
- Maybe this wish won't fade.
- But you know it will.

964
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,794
What's the point in wishes that don't last?

965
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,314
Magic... fades.

966
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,277
That's its nature.

967
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,237
It can show you the way,

968
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,197
but in the end,

969
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,157
it's up to you.

970
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,117
As the years go on,

971
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:45,113
your moments of magic
will become less and less.

972
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,077
And before you know it...

973
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,351
<i>.. you too will have forgotten.</i>

974
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,317
Forgotten all this.

975
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,237
Forgotten me.

976
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,919
And the magic... will have faded.

977
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:03,113
I won't. I'll never forget.

978
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,037
We shall see.

979
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,997
Now...

980
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,991
go to your bed and let me go to mine.

981
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,477
You're not going.

982
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,437
Have you turned to stone?

983
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:18,193
Do you think he's looking up at the same sky?

984
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,435
<i>IT: Well... I expect so,</i>

985
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,080
unless he's been whisked
to a different galaxy.

986
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,037
Which I am sure he has not.

987
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,997
Very tricky, that.

988
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,957
Galaxy's a big job.

989
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,917
Could you move over a bit?

990
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,877
<i>Hey. Hey!</i>

991
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,837
<i>What are you doing?</i>

992
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,797
Get off me.

993
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,758
Tomorrow will come quicker
if I stay with you tonight.

994
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:48,276
No, it won't.
It comes at a very similar speed.

995
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,715
- No matter where, you can't...
- Good night.

996
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,677
You'd better not snore.

997
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:57,679
Terrific.

998
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:00,637
I hope you appreciate this.

999
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,355
Hm.

1000
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,757
It's morning, Sand-fairy.

1001
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,717
I can make my wish.

1002
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,677
Sand-fairy?

1003
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,592
Sand-fairy!

1004
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,517
<i>Sand-fairy!</i>

1005
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:11,517
I knew it!

1006
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,477
It had to be you!

1007
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:16,279
Robert. Just in time for the dissection.

1008
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:19,352
How did you find out about the Sand-fairy?

1009
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:23,479
Thanks to you. Last night when you
went to the greenhouse, I followed you.

1010
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,279
<i>For years I've wondered
why I was never allowed in.</i>

1011
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,237
Now I know.

1012
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:31,710
I'm not sure if this Sand-fairy
is a crustacean or decapod or...

1013
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,268
Let It go.

1014
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,715
I need it to grant me my wish.

1015
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:39,951
- Wish? What are you talking about?
- I'm a Sand-fairy!

1016
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,348
There's a tiny clue in the name.

1017
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,079
<i>- It can talk.
- You should hear me sing.</i>

1018
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:51,595
Call it extra insurance.

1019
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:55,357
I, Charles Chicken...

1020
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,077
- Ahem.
- Ah.

1021
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,077
- Tea?
- Yes, thank you.

1022
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:03,151
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

1023
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:04,514
No, no.

1024
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:07,558
May I present my colleague
Professor Charles Chicken,

1025
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:10,029
MA, BSc, EGG?

1026
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:13,434
<i>Not a lot going on behind that beak.</i>

1027
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:17,037
I wonder where the wishes come from.

1028
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,997
Is it a gland?

1029
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:21,389
Perhaps there's something about its brain.

1030
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:23,152
Oh, hello. Good afternoon.

1031
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,310
- Maybe I'll slice it down the middle.
- No!

1032
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,311
I recognised you, Horace.

1033
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:29,872
You're not like other children.

1034
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,155
- I should hope not.
- No...

1035
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:35,232
<i>like a crazy kid experimenting
on things in the basement.</i>

1036
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:37,914
<i>- That is you.
- Enough! It is time.</i>

1037
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,117
Wait, if you slice it open it can't give you a wish.

1038
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:44,988
Are you suggesting I not perform
a proper exploratory dissection?

1039
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:47,674
Yes, I am for that idea.

1040
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,113
Let's have a vote, shall we?

1041
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:52,351
All in favour of the non-slicing open
approach say aye.

1042
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,317
Aye!

1043
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:58,075
Surely the best way to find out where
wishes come from is to ask for one.

1044
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,116
What could possibly go wrong?

1045
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,156
Surprisingly good thinking, Robert.

1046
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:05,630
Then we can study the wish
under strict laboratory conditions.

1047
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:07,836
But... what to wish for?

1048
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:11,475
What a delicious monster collection you have.

1049
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,952
Now I have you to complete it.

1050
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,519
Oh, no.

1051
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,477
<i>As fine a prize as I am,</i>

1052
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:20,199
you are yet missing one vital beast.

1053
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,871
Nice egg.

1054
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,872
Tyrannosaurus, if I'm not mistaken.

1055
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:29,748
Just make one... little... wish.

1056
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:31,717
<i>Come on, Horace.</i>

1057
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,916
<i>- You know you want to.
- OK.</i>

1058
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,195
<i>I wish for the egg to hatch.</i>

1059
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,397
That's rubbish.

1060
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:52,830
I know you don't trust the Sand-fairy...

1061
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:55,150
- Cyril, come quick!
- Where have you been?

1062
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:57,879
- Sand-fairy.
- But that's where we're going.

1063
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,837
No, you can't. He isn't there.

1064
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,911
What are you talking about?

1065
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,190
You've been to It already, haven't you?

1066
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,430
- No...
- You've wasted the wish.

1067
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,511
- I was trying to help.
- What have you done?

1068
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,352
I was doing it for Dad.

1069
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,351
<i>But Horace followed me.</i>

1070
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,000
- I had to, because you don't care!
- What do you mean?

1071
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,913
You idiot. Of course I care!

1072
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,230
We all care. But you...

1073
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:23,072
You had to ruin everything as usual!

1074
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,276
You're the one who doesn't care, Robert!

1075
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:27,954
Leave him! That's what he wants.

1076
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,349
You've ruined everything.

1077
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,317
<i>Don't go. Please.</i>

1078
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,399
It's not too late.

1079
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,317
<i>I've been trying to tell you.</i>

1080
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,037
<i>It's in the basement.</i>

1081
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,837
Here we go, Horace.

1082
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:50,990
I promised you a dinosaur.

1083
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:54,873
<i>And you shall get what you deserve.</i>

1084
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,913
<i>This... is Gerald.</i>

1085
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,508
<i>He dribbles a bit because he's only two.</i>

1086
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:12,237
Come in, children, come in.

1087
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,197
It's all right.

1088
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:16,111
<i>He's only interested in Horace.</i>

1089
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,077
Do something.

1090
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:24,030
<i>IT: This is an example of what we
in the wish game call a bad wish.</i>

1091
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:26,680
<i>Very bad, even badder than the bad ones.</i>

1092
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,675
Sand-fairy, make the wish stop.

1093
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:32,591
Ah, just let it gobble him up.

1094
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,796
He's hungry! The kid's delicious.

1095
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,836
He's a goner.

1096
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:52,834
- Did you hear that frightful noise?
- Sorry.

1097
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:54,672
Probably my gippy tummy.

1098
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:00,110
I know what to do.

1099
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:02,077
Jane?

1100
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,557
¶ Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star

1101
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,877
Music soothes the savage beast.

1102
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,837
I read it in one of your books.

1103
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:20,353
I take it all back.

1104
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:23,318
- She's wonderful.
C YRIL: Yes, keep it up, Jane.

1105
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,277
Fantastic.

1106
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,431
Raa-aargh!

1107
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:31,592
Oh, no. I take back all I just took back.

1108
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,870
Someone tell her to shut up!

1109
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,518
<i>It's killing me!</i>

1110
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,555
IT: I feel a... little light-headed now.

1111
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:54,317
IT: Hyperventilating.
- Horace!

1112
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:57,437
IT: Thank God that's over.

1113
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,158
IT: Hello?

1114
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:01,071
What's wrong with him?

1115
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:03,549
Get him to Mum, quick. She'll know what to do.

1116
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:06,677
I'll take him. Anthea, you make the wish.

1117
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,915
<i>- Sand-fairy.
- .. kid with the... Hello.</i>

1118
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,877
- Is that you, Mother?
- It's OK.

1119
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:13,837
Come to do my nails?

1120
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,797
Just a light buffing, thank you.

1121
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:18,599
<i>C YRIL: He's out of his head.
It's made him too weak.</i>

1122
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:21,513
<i>We have to get him back to the beach quickly.</i>

1123
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:24,239
<i>IT:.. maybe just a monkey with a wrench.</i>

1124
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,151
- I know how to save Dad.
- We have to wish.

1125
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,117
It's not enough. Trust me.

1126
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:29,997
After what you've put us through?

1127
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:31,957
All the wishes, it's been all about you.

1128
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:33,314
Not any more.

1129
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:36,278
<i>IT:.. used to be one during the war.
- All right, then.</i>

1130
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:38,191
You lot head to the beach.

1131
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:40,157
I'll take Horace to Mum.

1132
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,832
Come on, Horace.

1133
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,797
You'll never make a dance troupe.

1134
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,831
Hello. Are you the three wise monkeys?

1135
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:50,274
I'm Captain Spiky.

1136
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,235
Wait.

1137
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:54,957
You're right.

1138
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:56,917
I have wasted the wishes.

1139
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,635
You all go and see Dad and I'll take Horace.

1140
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:03,314
But you've got to make sure
Dad gets his compass.

1141
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:04,753
<i>IT: Hello, sir.</i>

1142
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:06,239
So he'll know where to find us.

1143
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,236
Come on, Horace.

1144
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:11,197
I've got you, Sand-fairy.

1145
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,793
Hello.

1146
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,348
You're my favourite one of the bunch, you know.

1147
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:17,752
I've got you too.

1148
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:20,400
Well, you're my favourite one of the bunch, too.

1149
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,357
And you're very tall.

1150
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,396
Come on.

1151
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,994
Just burp me once.

1152
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:30,240
Steady. Gently does it. That's it.

1153
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,311
C YRIL: There you are.
IT: Ah...

1154
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,311
<i>IT: That was awfuI!</i>

1155
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:38,350
That's better.

1156
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:41,352
There's no place like a mobile home.

1157
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:44,754
Are you strong enough
to grant us our wish now?

1158
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:47,869
Sorry, but that mad scientist
cousin of yours

1159
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:49,837
<i>has made the wish for today.</i>

1160
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,229
<i>You're going to have to wait
till tomorrow,</i>

1161
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:55,869
which is my birthday,
actually, as a matter of fact.

1162
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:57,473
I'll be 22.

1163
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:59,949
We can't wait till tomorrow.
It might be too late.

1164
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:01,917
IT: Really? All right.

1165
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,276
Well, maybe I've got something
down here that could help.

1166
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,037
This is a big book of wishes.

1167
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:10,793
This should help. OK.

1168
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,877
Ah, here we go.

1169
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,837
Genius wishes, instant wishes,

1170
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:18,388
interminable wishes, intellectual wishes,

1171
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,357
interruptive wishes.

1172
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:22,317
<i>This looks promising.</i>

1173
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:24,757
Ah, yes.

1174
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:27,229
Addendum C, regula Vll.

1175
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:31,029
<i>".. it being wholly inappropriate to
reinstate full wish-giving status</i>

1176
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:33,873
subject to all parties
being of sound mind and limb. "

1177
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:36,155
Ah, there you are.

1178
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:38,276
And where exactly is that?

1179
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:44,356
I think it means you haven't had
a whole day's wish, contractually speaking.

1180
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:48,035
Therefore you do have
some wish allowance left over.

1181
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:50,395
Oh, thank you.

1182
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:53,037
Oh, er... hm.

1183
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:55,680
You'd better be quick about it. Hm?

1184
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,671
OK, Sand-fairy.

1185
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,436
We wish for our dad to come home safely.

1186
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:03,238
And that's all.

1187
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:07,033
Well, if you're sure that's what you want...

1188
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:11,230
Holding hands. Nice touch.

1189
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,835
There!

1190
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:42,951
Look! I think it's Dad!

1191
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:45,190
<i>Come on, quick!</i>

1192
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:47,157
- Come on, Anthea.
- Come on!

1193
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:50,356
<i>Dad! Daddy!</i>

1194
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:17,916
- Daddy!
- Cyril!

1195
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:20,871
We thought you were lost.

1196
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,916
Oh... What's happening?

1197
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,275
I don't understand, how did I get here?

1198
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:27,271
- Oh...
- The Sand-fairy.

1199
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:28,793
We made a wish, Daddy.

1200
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,950
Has she been reading one of your novels?

1201
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,871
She won't sleep now.

1202
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,076
Where's Robert?

1203
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:37,037
He's in shock but he'll be OK.

1204
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:39,350
You did the right thing bringing him to me.

1205
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:41,590
Now... what happened?

1206
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:51,478
I still don't believe I'm here.
Wait till your mother finds out.

1207
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:53,471
She doesn't know about this place.

1208
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,357
- No-one does except us.
- All right.

1209
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,396
We'll surprise her and Robert later.

1210
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:01,836
There... There isn't going to be a later.

1211
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:07,032
<i>We haven't much time.</i>

1212
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,917
Only until the sun sets.

1213
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,596
I want this wish to last for ever.

1214
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:16,320
Please, Daddy, I want you to stay.

1215
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:21,237
It's Robert's idea.

1216
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:29,111
Dad! Dad!

1217
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:06,597
Ssh.

1218
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,472
How is he?

1219
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:13,791
Martha's been up with him all night.
I told her to take a rest.

1220
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:15,757
I don't know what's wrong with him.

1221
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:19,594
He just keeps muttering about
monsters and sand fairies.

1222
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:21,750
Maybe you should have a rest, too.

1223
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,877
We'll look after Horace.

1224
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,837
For a bit.

1225
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:29,673
- Well, if you're sure. I am quite tired.
- OK.

1226
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:31,635
Mum?

1227
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:33,233
Dad's OK.

1228
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:35,151
I know it.

1229
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,393
Horace, can you hear?

1230
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:43,435
Horace!

1231
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:45,351
- Robert!
- He's up now.

1232
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,237
Here, have some.

1233
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:52,198
- What is it?
- It's medicine. It's very good for you.

1234
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:54,669
I made it myself.

1235
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:56,637
Perhaps not, Jane.

1236
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,756
We need to talk.

1237
01:11:58,840 --> 01:11:59,989
Yes.

1238
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,957
About the dinosaur.

1239
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:03,996
And the wish.

1240
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,911
And It.

1241
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:09,474
It was all real. It wasn't a dream.

1242
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:12,836
- Yes, and it has to be our secret.
- But the world must know.

1243
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:14,512
The world doesn't have to.

1244
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,431
Yes...

1245
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:18,397
we can write a classified report.

1246
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:22,393
Bury it in red tape for 40 years
and deny everything. I like it.

1247
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:24,596
Or we could just keep it to ourselves.

1248
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,948
I've never had a secret
to share with anyone before.

1249
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:35,908
Well, now you have us.

1250
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:44,231
Allow me, my dear.

1251
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:51,275
Ah.

1252
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:53,316
Familiar face.

1253
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,391
<i>Stout fellow.</i>

1254
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:58,631
Mr Bialli, butcher... er, baker...
er candlestick maker.

1255
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:01,109
I heard about, well, you know...

1256
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:03,077
Poor children.

1257
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:05,151
I thought these might cheer them up.

1258
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:08,676
- Very kind indeed.
- Here you are.

1259
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,990
- One each.
- Thank you.

1260
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:14,829
The papers say
it's safe to go back to London.

1261
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:19,319
Apparently a fleet of Zeppelins
were turned back.

1262
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:21,277
The pilot said he saw angels.

1263
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:23,271
So, I think it's time we went home.

1264
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:26,671
<i>Are you in there?</i>

1265
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:30,878
IT: Hey! Hey, turn that light out!

1266
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:33,030
- Where is he?
- Don't you know there's a war on?

1267
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,075
Hello!

1268
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:40,037
He's been to the hairdresser's!

1269
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,397
Well, so it's you again.

1270
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:47,832
What's he doing here?

1271
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,832
I'm really sorry
for trying to cut you into little pieces.

1272
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:54,469
Oh, well, never mind. It was fun.
Apology accepted.

1273
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:57,677
- Have one of these.
- I suppose you want today's wish.

1274
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:00,752
<i>- No.
- No... No, we don't.</i>

1275
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:02,910
- You don't want a wish?
- No.

1276
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:07,152
I've never heard such a thing. Surely I can
tempt you with one teeny, little, baby wish?

1277
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:10,038
We've decided not to make any more of them.

1278
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:13,317
That's the most sensible thing
I've heard in 8,311 years.

1279
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:16,153
We've come to say goodbye.
We're going home.

1280
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,639
<i>Going home?</i>

1281
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:19,551
We've just started to have fun.

1282
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:21,790
I made you this. It's a birthday card.

1283
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:25,074
<i>- How did you know?
- You told us.</i>

1284
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:26,832
<i>- Oh, yes.
- Here you are, Robert.</i>

1285
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:28,751
Don't get many cards these days.

1286
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:32,992
You know how it is,
after your 6,523rd birthday,

1287
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:35,514
- you just stop counting.
- You don't look that old.

1288
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,033
No, I drink a lot of moisturiser.

1289
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:39,554
<i>And you can't have a birthday without a present.</i>

1290
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:41,551
Brown paper - my favourite!

1291
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:44,200
<i>- You'll have to unwrap it.
- Yes er... I knew that.</i>

1292
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:45,872
Ah!

1293
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,552
<i>Er...</i>

1294
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:50,153
It's...

1295
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:52,151
He's called Brian.

1296
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:53,912
He's to keep you company.

1297
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,752
<i>C YRIL: Now for the best bit.</i>

1298
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:58,877
<i>IT: Hello, Brian. Brian? Hello, Brian.</i>

1299
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:01,030
Not very chatty, is he?

1300
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:06,113
¶ Happy birthday to you

1301
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,357
¶ Happy birthday to you

1302
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,271
You have to blow them out.

1303
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:12,430
¶ Happy birthday...
- And make a wish.

1304
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:16,559
<i>.. Psammead Crustacea Anostraca Decopodlium</i>

1305
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:19,712
Anthropodlious Wishasaurus...

1306
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:22,633
¶ Happy birthday to you

1307
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:24,711
¶ 8,311 today!

1308
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:42,510
Well, that was the best birthday
I have ever, ever had...

1309
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:45,391
Come on, you lot. It's time to leave.

1310
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:47,835
<i>.. except when I was 15,
and I was given a yak.</i>

1311
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,797
Come on, Horace.

1312
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:51,996
<i>Look, I would help to clean up, you know, but...</i>

1313
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,957
I've got a bad leg.

1314
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:55,917
Goodbye, I'm going to really miss you.

1315
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,877
<i>I will miss you too, child.</i>

1316
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:00,512
Hang on, you're not...

1317
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,477
<i>you're not going, going, going are you?</i>

1318
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,790
<i>What... all?</i>

1319
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:08,236
You could come with us. Cyril and I
would move in with the Lamb.

1320
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:10,038
We'd fill our room with sand for you.

1321
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:11,997
You'd do that for me?

1322
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:14,719
That's very kind of you, child, but...

1323
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:17,028
I understand.

1324
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:19,156
Goodbye, child.

1325
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:20,593
Bye.

1326
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:23,312
Sand-fairy,

1327
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:26,517
when you blew out your candles,
what did you wish for?

1328
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,477
Me, make a wish?

1329
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,630
You must be joking!

1330
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,551
<i>- Goodbye.
Let's go.</i>

1331
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:35,393
<i>- Come on.
C YRIL: We'll miss you.</i>

1332
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:37,357
- Bye.
- Horace...

1333
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:40,277
Bye, Sand-fairy.

1334
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:43,757
Goodbye, Sand-fairy.

1335
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:47,797
<i>Come on, Jane!</i>

1336
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:10,151
It won't start.

1337
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:13,038
It could be water on the carburettor
or a sandwich.

1338
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:15,998
There were suspicious crumbs
round the crank handle.

1339
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:18,992
Not to worry, I've got a book here
somewhere. Excuse me.

1340
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:23,270
Or did I eat it? The sandwich, not the book,

1341
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:26,511
although I have devoured many a book
over the last few years.

1342
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,272
This isn't helping things, is it?

1343
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:30,430
Does this mean we're staying?

1344
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:32,431
I just want to go home.

1345
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:35,198
We'll be home soon.

1346
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:38,397
I'm sure your uncle will fix
the problem. In the meantime...

1347
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:41,233
best stand behind something flame resistant.

1348
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:43,356
I know, let's play a game.

1349
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,317
How about hide-and-seek?

1350
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:48,472
- I've had a lot of practice.
- All right, Horace, hide-and-seek.

1351
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:51,834
- I'll be it.
C YRIL: Good, good.

1352

<i>Dear Sand-fairy,</i>

1366
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:25,518
<i>I've been thinking about
what you said to me that night.</i>

<i>That magic fades because people forget.</i>

1368

<i>I want you to know that I won't forget.</i>

01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:37,637
