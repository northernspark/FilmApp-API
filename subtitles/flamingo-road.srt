00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:59,403
There's a Flamingo Road
in every town.

3
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:03,913
It is the street of social success,
the avenue of achievement,

4
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:08,280
the golden goal for all who struggle
and aspire to reach the top

5
00:01:08,351 --> 00:01:12,515
and sometimes find that from the top,
there's no other place to go.

6
00:01:13,456 --> 00:01:15,048
And so, in Boldon City,

7
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:17,719
a small town with people of big dreams,

8
00:01:17,794 --> 00:01:21,389
their Flamingo Road had
touched them all with ambition.

9
00:01:21,464 --> 00:01:25,093
The political factions who killed flies
on the porch of the Palmer House,

10
00:01:25,902 --> 00:01:28,769
the big timers who killed care
at Lute Mae's,

11
00:01:28,938 --> 00:01:33,136
a place that had been called many things,
most recently a road house,

12
00:01:33,777 --> 00:01:36,746
the Tony Night Club set
who sip champagne,

13
00:01:36,813 --> 00:01:39,646
the gang at Pete's cafe
who dunk doughnuts,

14
00:01:40,283 --> 00:01:42,945
even the gaudy show folks
with Coyne's Carnival

15
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:46,420
who once a year set up their tents
on the wrong side of the tracks.

16
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:47,581
corners of the Earth!

17
00:01:47,657 --> 00:01:51,753
We have none other than Bonnieta,
300 pounds of loving.

18
00:01:51,828 --> 00:01:55,491
She shakes and shimmies like the jelly
on your grandmother's table.

19
00:01:55,565 --> 00:01:56,623
Also, on the inside...

20
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:57,791
You won't see it again
for another year.

21
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:00,267
Only in town once a year, folks!

22
00:02:00,336 --> 00:02:03,999
All right, then! Glad to see you.
Hey, hey! Hey, hey! Come in!

23
00:02:04,073 --> 00:02:05,734
Come in, folks, come in!

24
00:02:05,809 --> 00:02:07,276
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
The big-time show.

25
00:02:07,343 --> 00:02:11,803
The biggest show on wheels!
Twelve cars of outstanding attractions

26
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,213
brought to you
from the four corners of the Earth.

27
00:02:14,284 --> 00:02:15,444
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

28
00:02:15,518 --> 00:02:18,954
Hurry, hurry!
Right this way for that featured attraction.

29
00:02:19,022 --> 00:02:22,890
Those masked beauties of
the Sultan's harem, in exotic, tantalizing,

30
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,725
captivating dances of the Far East
as you've always wanted to see them.

31
00:02:26,796 --> 00:02:30,596
It's spicy! It's daring!
It's a thing to take your breath away!

32
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:33,693
A dance to make the old men young
and the young men old!

33
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:34,964
A dance, gentlemen, which is a replica,

34
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:37,197
an exact replica of the dance

35
00:02:37,273 --> 00:02:38,968
that you would expect to see
in the Far East.

36
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:42,205
I can see that you're all men of the world,
traveled and sophisticated.

37
00:02:42,278 --> 00:02:44,371
But you, gentlemen,
I'm sure each and every one of you

38
00:02:44,447 --> 00:02:47,541
will understand and appreciate
the unveiled beauty which will be yours

39
00:02:47,617 --> 00:02:50,882
for the small price of 10 cents, one dime,
the tenth part of a dollar!

40
00:02:50,954 --> 00:02:53,684
Every year you've been telling me
the same thing.

41
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,953
"Next season will be better. " But it ain't.
Now I want my money.

42
00:02:57,026 --> 00:03:00,154
Rent for the carnival lot, the light bills,
and the money I loaned you two years ago.

43
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,199
But, sir, I just don't have
the necessary funds at the moment.

44
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,700
Things in the entertainment world
are at a low ebb, sir.

45
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:08,498
Yes, sir, the tide is sure enough out.

46
00:03:08,571 --> 00:03:11,233
Now, sir, if you'll just give me
a little bit more time, I...

47
00:03:11,307 --> 00:03:14,970
All the time I'm gonna give you is
the time that it takes me to go uptown,

48
00:03:15,044 --> 00:03:18,411
get an attachment against your show
and find the sheriff to serve the papers.

49
00:03:18,481 --> 00:03:21,746
I'm gonna take your show.
That's what I'm gonna do.

50
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,422
The young ladies will unveil briefly,
the box office will open

51
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:28,923
and the big show will continue
on the inside.

52
00:03:28,992 --> 00:03:30,220
And, now, ladies and gentlemen,

53
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,625
if you'll be kind enough
to step up to the box office,

54
00:03:32,695 --> 00:03:36,791
the young lady will oblige you by
selling you the ticket and the big show...

55
00:03:38,668 --> 00:03:41,296
Hurry it up, girls.
We're folding the show!

56
00:03:41,371 --> 00:03:42,429
Not again, Tom!

57
00:03:42,505 --> 00:03:44,473
Get out of those costumes.
Get going, girls.

58
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,564
Here we go again, kids.

59
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,839
Run, run, run. What do they think we are?
Three blind mice?

60
00:03:48,912 --> 00:03:50,277
Tell them to strike the canvas
and get loaded.

61
00:03:50,346 --> 00:03:53,645
We got to beat an attachment
across the state line!

62
00:03:53,716 --> 00:03:57,152
Get yourself together, girls.
The sheriff's breathing down our necks.

63
00:04:10,066 --> 00:04:12,057
Hello, there, Sheriff!

64
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,840
Hi, Sheriff Semple, sir!

65
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,343
- Boatright!
- Yes, sir.

66
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,417
- Boatright, where's my other chair at?
- Goodness, Sheriff, if it ain't...

67
00:04:30,486 --> 00:04:33,922
I remember once before
I didn't have me a chair for my hat.

68
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,356
It dropped to the floor.
I had to pick it up myself.

69
00:04:36,426 --> 00:04:37,450
Yes, sir.

70
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,994
- Boatright?
- Yes, sir?

71
00:04:39,062 --> 00:04:41,530
Whatever happened to that other boy?

72
00:04:41,597 --> 00:04:44,760
I don't know.
I guess maybe he's still in jail.

73
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,700
Here we are, Sheriff.

74
00:04:49,105 --> 00:04:51,164
Yes, everything's gonna be all right now.

75
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,641
Yes, sir.
Everything's gonna be all right now.

76
00:05:06,823 --> 00:05:09,485
- You want to see me, Sheriff?
- What have you been doing, bub?

77
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,753
Fishing.

78
00:05:11,461 --> 00:05:15,761
I didn't figure you'd be fool enough
to do any work on the county time.

79
00:05:15,832 --> 00:05:19,529
Well, if I felt like I was getting someplace
I wouldn't mind doing a day's work.

80
00:05:19,602 --> 00:05:22,298
The county pays me little enough,
but I don't even earn that.

81
00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:26,604
There are plenty of folks in this county
who would do less for a lot more.

82
00:05:26,809 --> 00:05:29,573
When I gave you this job,
I told you to let me do the worrying.

83
00:05:29,645 --> 00:05:31,806
Well, it's kind of hard
not to do your own worrying.

84
00:05:31,881 --> 00:05:35,112
I got plans for you, bub.
Long-range plans.

85
00:05:35,651 --> 00:05:38,347
Deputy sheriff is just a good starter.

86
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,652
A man can make a heap of friends
being deputy sheriff.

87
00:05:41,724 --> 00:05:44,818
Of course, he can make enemies, too,
but that's politics.

88
00:05:44,894 --> 00:05:49,263
You just got to be sure that you make
more friends than you do enemies.

89
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,366
I want you to run out to that carnival show
that's playing across the tracks.

90
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:57,634
Mark Lanright has got
an attachment against them.

91
00:05:59,342 --> 00:06:01,867
- Field!
- Hi!

92
00:06:02,145 --> 00:06:05,308
I've been chasing you
for the past 10 miles.

93
00:06:05,381 --> 00:06:06,370
Hello, Sheriff.

94
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,646
- You're gonna have to get a faster car.
- Evening, Miss Annabelle.

95
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:13,746
Don't keep the lady waiting, bub.
And don't forget to serve these papers.

96
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,118
Hi, Annabelle.

97
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,930
Field Carlisle,
I shouldn't even speak to you.

98
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:25,331
You promised to play tennis with me
yesterday afternoon.

99
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:26,993
Well, I'm a busy man.

100
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,766
The duties of a deputy sheriff
don't allow much time for tennis.

101
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:32,706
Papa says that deputy sheriff job
is just ridiculous,

102
00:06:32,775 --> 00:06:34,766
that you should have finished law school
and then you'd be...

103
00:06:34,844 --> 00:06:37,745
- Respectable.
- Well, that's what Papa says.

104
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,476
You know, your papa can say
almost anything he wants to

105
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,017
and people listen to him.

106
00:06:42,085 --> 00:06:44,883
The trouble with you is
you just don't want to improve yourself.

107
00:06:44,954 --> 00:06:48,754
Look at that outlandish cowboy hat.
Why don't you wear something dignified?

108
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:53,262
- I reckon I'm used to it.
- Used to it? I don't understand you, Field.

109
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,388
How can you be so stubborn
about some things

110
00:06:55,465 --> 00:06:58,298
and so easygoing about everything else?

111
00:06:58,367 --> 00:06:59,959
You know, you look awful pretty today.

112
00:07:00,036 --> 00:07:02,163
I've got a good mind
to give you a great big kiss.

113
00:07:02,238 --> 00:07:06,106
Right here in the middle of the street?
Really! You get the craziest notions.

114
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:10,407
Isn't that the truth? Well,
I got to go do something official. Bye.

115
00:07:10,746 --> 00:07:15,979
Papa says to invite you to dinner tonight.
And don't you dare stand me up.

116
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,112
If I could be with you
I'd love you strong

117
00:08:23,186 --> 00:08:27,555
I want you to know that I wouldn't go

118
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,116
Until...

119
00:08:32,662 --> 00:08:34,630
What are you doing here?

120
00:08:34,697 --> 00:08:37,689
Getting up a parade.
You're just in time. Who are you?

121
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,098
Deputy sheriff.

122
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:40,396
Oh.

123
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:42,232
Well, then you're not in time.

124
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:46,708
Yeah. I could figure that looking over
the lot. They must have left in a hurry.

125
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,472
- Did they forget you?
- No.

126
00:08:50,246 --> 00:08:52,407
Why didn't you go with them?

127
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,051
Look, if you want to throw
your weight around,

128
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,144
why don't you go outside
where there's plenty of room?

129
00:08:59,222 --> 00:09:01,213
I'm just being mildly official.

130
00:09:01,757 --> 00:09:04,248
You don't look much like a sheriff.

131
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,790
You look more like Buffalo Bill
with that hat on.

132
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,199
Look, all sheriffs got to wear
this kind of hat,

133
00:09:12,268 --> 00:09:15,431
otherwise people wouldn't know
they were the law.

134
00:09:17,707 --> 00:09:19,675
Why didn't you go with the others?

135
00:09:19,742 --> 00:09:22,438
They weren't going anywhere.
They were just running.

136
00:09:22,511 --> 00:09:24,672
If it isn't this town, it's another.

137
00:09:24,747 --> 00:09:27,944
Besides, I got tired of being
on the wrong end of a rabbit hunt.

138
00:09:28,017 --> 00:09:30,747
- Doesn't make sense.
- It does to me.

139
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,353
Well, look, you can't stay here alone
in a tent.

140
00:09:34,423 --> 00:09:35,788
What you gonna do?

141
00:09:35,858 --> 00:09:38,326
Well, I could pan for gold or something.

142
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:44,695
- What's your name?
- Lane. Lane Bellamy. Thanks.

143
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:46,962
Lane? That's a funny name for a girl.

144
00:09:47,036 --> 00:09:48,799
I suppose it was something fancy
like Elaine,

145
00:09:48,871 --> 00:09:50,498
but nobody ever bothered
to call me anything but...

146
00:09:50,573 --> 00:09:54,475
- What's yours?
- Field. Field Carlisle.

147
00:09:55,544 --> 00:09:57,569
That's a funny name for a man.

148
00:09:57,647 --> 00:09:59,512
Well, it's really Fielding.

149
00:09:59,582 --> 00:10:03,643
Look, you couldn't go away and forget
I was here for the night, could you?

150
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:07,985
I could sleep here and then tomorrow
figure out something to do.

151
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,057
- How about it?
- Have you got any money?

152
00:10:11,127 --> 00:10:14,528
- Sure, I've got three dollars.
- It isn't very much.

153
00:10:14,597 --> 00:10:18,727
That's a lot when you think of how
many times I didn't have three dollars.

154
00:10:19,468 --> 00:10:21,732
What'd you do in the carnival?

155
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,173
Well, sometimes I was Seminole Annie,

156
00:10:25,241 --> 00:10:28,506
then again I was Princess Kalina,
siren of the Pacific.

157
00:10:28,577 --> 00:10:32,240
Lately, I've been one of the Sultan's
favorite dancing girls.

158
00:10:32,315 --> 00:10:35,978
But most of the times,
I was just a little tired and dirty.

159
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,613
Sick of moldy tents and one-night stands
and greasy food.

160
00:10:41,957 --> 00:10:45,188
Sick of having people look at me
like I was cheap.

161
00:10:45,261 --> 00:10:48,230
Look, why don't you come uptown
with me and get some supper?

162
00:10:48,297 --> 00:10:51,266
Maybe we can figure out
what to do about you.

163
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,160
You wouldn't have anything personal
in mind, would you?

164
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:57,171
Nothing. I just don't like to eat by myself.

165
00:11:00,376 --> 00:11:03,675
I wouldn't have to go like this.
I've got better clothes.

166
00:11:04,947 --> 00:11:07,347
- You sure you want me to go?
- Sure.

167
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:12,046
There's an attachment on this show.
Right now you're the only tangible asset.

168
00:11:12,121 --> 00:11:14,112
I won't be but a minute.

169
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:20,720
- Maybe I'd better wait outside.
- No, you don't have to if you don't want...

170
00:11:20,796 --> 00:11:23,890
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you, Sheriff.

171
00:11:24,467 --> 00:11:27,493
- I guess I had you figured all wrong.
- Why?

172
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,867
You really meant that, didn't you?

173
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,839
About taking me uptown
for something to eat?

174
00:11:33,008 --> 00:11:36,068
No bargains?
No "I'll do this if you'll do that?"

175
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:38,972
No hot breath down my neck?

176
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:44,775
Better?

177
00:11:44,854 --> 00:11:46,549
- A lot.
- Good.

178
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:50,388
You know something?
You're too pretty to be alone in Boldon.

179
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:58,127
I've been in lots worse towns.
Took pretty good care of myself, too.

180
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:01,832
I'll bet you did at that. Let's go.
All right.

181
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,258
Here, take this inside
and cut them up, will you?

182
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,417
Right away. Cut them up.

183
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:25,517
Hello, Sheriff.
- Evening, Joe.

184
00:12:25,594 --> 00:12:27,391
Well, how are you, Field?
- Hi, Pete.

185
00:12:27,463 --> 00:12:28,862
One hamburger, hold sauce.

186
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:31,991
Hey, bring me some more pie
and another pitcher of milk.

187
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:35,400
- Coming right up.
How's everything? How's the soup?

188
00:12:36,305 --> 00:12:38,000
Hi, Field.
- Hello, Millie.

189
00:12:38,073 --> 00:12:40,633
- How's the Blue Plate?
- You couldn't do worse.

190
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:43,337
- You're out late tonight.
- Rabbit hunting.

191
00:12:43,412 --> 00:12:45,346
Must use quite a snare.

192
00:12:46,315 --> 00:12:47,839
Millie, this is Lane Bellamy.

193
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:49,316
- Hi.
- Hello.

194
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:52,783
- You're gonna have the Blue Plate, too?
- Well, if it's no worse than you say it is.

195
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:56,450
It couldn't be.
Don't eat the soup, it's awful.

196
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,518
Two Blue Plates!

197
00:12:59,595 --> 00:13:01,426
Well, here we are.

198
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:07,093
- Well, aren't you gonna ask me?
- What? The story of your life?

199
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:09,364
I figure that's the least you're entitled to.

200
00:13:09,438 --> 00:13:11,736
You know, I'd almost forgotten
I didn't know you.

201
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:15,573
There didn't seem to be anything for me
to be curious about.

202
00:13:16,846 --> 00:13:19,110
You said that as though you meant it.

203
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:24,010
I hope this won't spoil
a beautiful friendship.

204
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,886
If you want anything else, just yell.
Everybody else does.

205
00:13:26,956 --> 00:13:28,890
You're a good girl.
- Good and ready.

206
00:13:30,593 --> 00:13:34,859
Do you go through this every night?
It comes with the Blue Plate special.

207
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,832
We got up to where your great ambition
was to be a dancer.

208
00:13:42,805 --> 00:13:44,397
Isn't much more to tell.

209
00:13:44,473 --> 00:13:48,204
I had a few jobs with burlesque,
got stranded in Helmet,

210
00:13:48,511 --> 00:13:50,502
then a fellow with a doll pitch
wanted an assistant

211
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,945
so I hooked up with Coyne's Carnival.

212
00:13:53,015 --> 00:13:56,212
And that takes us right up to 8:30.

213
00:13:56,285 --> 00:13:59,083
- Now what are you gonna do?
- Catch my breath.

214
00:13:59,154 --> 00:14:01,987
You got to make a living.
What can you do?

215
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,822
I was gonna figure that one out tonight.

216
00:14:06,395 --> 00:14:08,386
- Hey, Pete!
- Yes, sir.

217
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,862
I was just wondering if you could use
another girl to wait tables?

218
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:15,267
- Well, I don't know about that.
- Miss Bellamy here is looking for a job

219
00:14:15,337 --> 00:14:17,669
and I notice that business
has been pretty good.

220
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,607
- You ever wait a table before?
- Once.

221
00:14:20,676 --> 00:14:24,737
Here no one will know the difference.
Okay. You wait lunch and supper.

222
00:14:24,813 --> 00:14:26,872
Ten dollars a week, your meals and tips.

223
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,042
Well, you can do better than that.

224
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:32,212
Everybody knows the restaurant business
better than I do.

225
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:36,122
- I think it's wonderful. I'll take it. Thanks.
- What for? So you're getting fallen arches.

226
00:14:36,191 --> 00:14:39,388
Hey, Millie, the new girl here starts
tomorrow, noons and supper.

227
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,122
Oh, good.

228
00:14:42,531 --> 00:14:46,058
- May I have a check, please?
- Did you ever wait table before, honey?

229
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,194
- Well, not in a cafe.
- Ain't anything to it.

230
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,931
Just bring them in full,
take them out empty,

231
00:14:50,005 --> 00:14:52,769
and don't drop the tray
when someone pinches you.

232
00:14:52,841 --> 00:14:54,706
And you'll get pinched.

233
00:14:54,777 --> 00:14:57,473
Millie, you don't happen to know of
a good, cheap room someplace, do you?

234
00:14:57,546 --> 00:14:59,309
Only kind I do know.

235
00:14:59,915 --> 00:15:03,578
I tell you what. You and me could go in
on a double, if you want to try it?

236
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:04,880
That'd be swell.

237
00:15:04,954 --> 00:15:08,321
- You got a place to stay tonight?
- Yes. Yes, I have. Thanks.

238
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:13,056
- None of my business, mind you.
- Let's get out of here.

239
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,297
- Well, I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

240
00:15:15,364 --> 00:15:18,458
Look, I'm not gonna try and thank you
for everything now, but...

241
00:15:18,534 --> 00:15:20,024
Well, thanks, anyway.

242
00:15:20,102 --> 00:15:21,535
Hey, bub.

243
00:15:21,604 --> 00:15:23,401
Surprised to see you, bub.

244
00:15:23,472 --> 00:15:26,339
Thought you'd be having a fancy dinner
up on Flamingo Road.

245
00:15:26,408 --> 00:15:28,376
Well, Coyne cleared out.

246
00:15:28,444 --> 00:15:31,038
- Miss Bellamy here is all he left.
- Hi.

247
00:15:31,113 --> 00:15:34,173
This ain't a very good town
to get stranded in.

248
00:15:34,783 --> 00:15:38,241
- Well, no town is.
- Pete just gave her a job. I asked him to.

249
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,118
That's good.
We got a nice town, Miss Bellamy.

250
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:45,456
We aim to keep it that way.
Everybody working and happy.

251
00:15:46,261 --> 00:15:48,729
- I'll take you home.
- You do that, Field.

252
00:15:48,797 --> 00:15:51,766
You've got a great reputation for courtesy.

253
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:54,268
- Figure to see you later.
- Yeah.

254
00:15:54,336 --> 00:15:55,564
Like to have
some more milk, Sheriff?

255
00:15:55,638 --> 00:15:57,902
Yeah, fill it up.

256
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:05,911
Was that fat man telling me
to get out of town?

257
00:16:05,981 --> 00:16:08,313
I never know for sure
what he means, myself.

258
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,545
Hey, he gives me the creeps.

259
00:16:10,619 --> 00:16:13,918
We had better looking people
than that in our sideshows.

260
00:16:13,989 --> 00:16:16,583
- Do you like him?
- No.

261
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:19,150
Now that I come to think of it,
I don't guess I do.

262
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,287
Well, how come you work for him then?

263
00:16:21,363 --> 00:16:24,298
Well, he's a very important man
in this town.

264
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,127
That's a very funny reason.

265
00:16:46,221 --> 00:16:49,713
You don't have to stay here tonight.
You know that, don't you?

266
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:52,420
Sometimes a nice guy comes along
and even the things he says

267
00:16:52,494 --> 00:16:56,123
don't sound the way they did
when somebody else said them.

268
00:16:56,331 --> 00:16:58,231
Would you like to sit on my porch
for a minute?

269
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,426
Yeah.

270
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:04,333
It's funny how everything can change
within a couple of hours.

271
00:17:04,406 --> 00:17:06,806
Supposing I had run away with Coyne
and the others,

272
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,275
I would've just had to keep on going.

273
00:17:09,344 --> 00:17:13,246
Got to stop sometime
because after a while you get afraid.

274
00:17:14,149 --> 00:17:17,414
Then there isn't anything left
that you want or care about.

275
00:17:17,486 --> 00:17:20,580
- You don't feel like that now, do you?
- Oh, no.

276
00:17:21,223 --> 00:17:24,420
For the first time in my life,
I feel I really belong someplace.

277
00:17:24,493 --> 00:17:26,757
And someplace belongs to me.

278
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:30,856
I live in Boldon and I don't ever have
to leave unless I want to.

279
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,834
Hey, look, they can't make me go,
can they?

280
00:17:35,204 --> 00:17:36,865
I mean, if I don't want to.

281
00:17:36,939 --> 00:17:40,340
They can't just bat a person around
because the town doesn't want them.

282
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:41,535
No.

283
00:17:43,579 --> 00:17:45,012
That's good.

284
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:52,209
Well, it's getting late.
That fat man said he wanted to see you.

285
00:17:52,454 --> 00:17:54,012
I suppose so.

286
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:56,683
Well, good night.

287
00:17:57,726 --> 00:17:59,125
Good night.

288
00:17:59,461 --> 00:18:01,520
- You know something?
- What?

289
00:18:02,264 --> 00:18:04,630
I'll bet you're a lousy sheriff.

290
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,994
Mmm.

291
00:18:32,127 --> 00:18:33,890
- Boatright, hurry up!
- Yes, sir.

292
00:18:33,962 --> 00:18:35,657
- Did you find Field?
- Yes, sir.

293
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:40,600
He's eating breakfast at the Eagle Cafe
and he's had six cups of coffee already.

294
00:18:48,577 --> 00:18:49,805
Hello?

295
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:53,905
Oh, yes, Sheriff, he's here.
Hey, Field! Field!

296
00:18:53,982 --> 00:18:55,779
- Yeah?
- It's for you.

297
00:19:00,923 --> 00:19:03,323
Hey, bub, it don't look exactly right,

298
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:07,123
my deputy spending so much
of the taxpayers' time drinking coffee.

299
00:19:07,196 --> 00:19:09,790
Get shined up,
pick me up at the hotel at 7:00.

300
00:19:09,865 --> 00:19:11,765
Keep this evening free.

301
00:19:19,274 --> 00:19:22,334
That was the Sheriff.
I got to see him tonight.

302
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,402
- I'm sorry about our date.
- So am I.

303
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:25,810
- Tomorrow?
- Sure.

304
00:19:25,881 --> 00:19:26,973
Good.

305
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:32,682
- Well, Pete, how's she doing?
- Fine. Okay. She's the best I ever had.

306
00:19:35,891 --> 00:19:39,554
I had to slap him a couple of times.
Outside of that, he bored me stiff.

307
00:19:39,628 --> 00:19:41,926
- How about going out with me tonight?
- Well, I...

308
00:19:41,997 --> 00:19:44,659
- What time will I pick you up?
- After 8:00.

309
00:19:46,168 --> 00:19:47,362
I'll take it.

310
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,428
Hey, if you're gonna be
free tonight, want to go on a double date?

311
00:19:50,505 --> 00:19:54,134
I'm going out with Tunis Simms.
We could get his brother Johnny for you.

312
00:19:54,209 --> 00:19:55,801
Awful nice boys.

313
00:19:56,044 --> 00:19:57,443
Thanks, Millie. I don't think so.

314
00:19:57,512 --> 00:20:00,447
Oh, honey, you can't sit home
like a dope every night

315
00:20:00,515 --> 00:20:02,312
waiting for Field
to get around to seeing you.

316
00:20:02,384 --> 00:20:03,544
Some other time, maybe.

317
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,416
You sure seem to know all the answers,

318
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:07,717
but I'm afraid
you don't understand the questions.

319
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:11,281
How's a fellow supposed to appreciate a
girl if she ain't popular with other fellows?

320
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,760
Look, baby,
people like Field live on Flamingo Road.

321
00:20:13,829 --> 00:20:15,592
People like us live on River Street.

322
00:20:15,664 --> 00:20:18,827
And on River Street,
the Simms boys are awful nice.

323
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:20,732
Oh, so that's what makes
the difference in Boldon?

324
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:23,600
- Living on Flamingo Road?
- It sure helps.

325
00:20:23,672 --> 00:20:26,641
Well, maybe one of these days,
I'll get a place on Flamingo Road, myself.

326
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:30,166
Well, when you get there, honey,
save me a room and bed.

327
00:20:30,245 --> 00:20:32,543
Can you break down now
and tell me where we're going?

328
00:20:32,614 --> 00:20:35,640
How are you and Annabelle
getting along these days?

329
00:20:35,717 --> 00:20:37,184
Same as usual, I guess.

330
00:20:37,252 --> 00:20:40,085
You two think about getting married ever?

331
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,521
You know I can't do that on my salary.

332
00:20:42,591 --> 00:20:46,823
Maybe we can straighten that out.
I told you I had plans for you.

333
00:20:47,362 --> 00:20:51,856
Plans that don't include you getting mixed
up with that stray cat from the carnival.

334
00:20:54,303 --> 00:20:57,795
How would you like to be a member
of the State Legislature?

335
00:20:57,873 --> 00:20:58,897
I'm no politician.

336
00:20:58,974 --> 00:21:01,306
I don't think I could get 10 votes
from my own home town.

337
00:21:01,376 --> 00:21:02,968
I didn't ask you
how to get elected senator.

338
00:21:03,045 --> 00:21:06,105
I asked you if you wanted to get elected.
Do you or don't you?

339
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:10,015
- Well, yeah. I guess anybody would.
- You catch on fast.

340
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:13,343
Now, all you need to know is two words,
"yep" and "nope. "

341
00:21:13,422 --> 00:21:16,050
You can't go wrong
if you say "yep" to the right people

342
00:21:16,124 --> 00:21:18,285
and "nope" to the rest of them.

343
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,885
It might be a good thing, bub,
if you was to get married.

344
00:21:20,963 --> 00:21:23,761
Man going to the Legislature's
got to have a heart of gold

345
00:21:23,832 --> 00:21:26,824
and a respectable wife for voters to see.

346
00:21:26,902 --> 00:21:31,305
Gives folks confidence in him.
Never been able to figure out why.

347
00:21:31,473 --> 00:21:35,204
Yep, Annabelle Weldon would be
just about right.

348
00:21:36,178 --> 00:21:40,342
You see, bub, I am planning
to skin me a big bear one of these days.

349
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:43,146
Step on it. It's after 7:00.

350
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:46,278
Sure don't want to keep
Dan Reynolds waiting.

351
00:21:46,355 --> 00:21:50,587
Dan Reynolds?
- Pinch its ear, bub. I like to hear it squeal.

352
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:11,475
- Good evening, Sheriff Semple, sir.
- Evening, Wade.

353
00:22:12,714 --> 00:22:15,444
They nominating senators here
this evening?

354
00:22:15,517 --> 00:22:19,044
There are a lot of senators elected
at Lute Mae's place.

355
00:22:19,388 --> 00:22:21,322
And governors, too.

356
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:23,824
Come along, I'll show you
and everything's going to be all right.

357
00:22:23,892 --> 00:22:25,883
You'll meet the right people.

358
00:22:37,339 --> 00:22:39,773
Hurry up, Gracie. The well's going dry.

359
00:22:39,841 --> 00:22:42,401
Where do those big shots put it all?

360
00:22:45,013 --> 00:22:48,244
Well, Titus, you old blimp, you!
How are you?

361
00:22:48,316 --> 00:22:49,783
How are you, Lute Mae?

362
00:22:49,851 --> 00:22:51,614
I didn't expect to see you
in my place again.

363
00:22:51,686 --> 00:22:54,712
I don't get around like I used to.
Meet Field Carlisle.

364
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,587
- How are you, Field?
- Howdy, Lute Mae.

365
00:22:56,658 --> 00:23:00,025
I knew your father, the judge.
You look some like him.

366
00:23:00,095 --> 00:23:02,859
And I always said there was never
a handsomer man in the state.

367
00:23:02,931 --> 00:23:04,421
- Thanks.
- Your friends are upstairs.

368
00:23:04,499 --> 00:23:08,299
- Yeah, I reckoned they would be.
- Go on up. Meet the big boss.

369
00:23:08,703 --> 00:23:12,969
No matter how many times you see it,
you just can't believe it's real.

370
00:23:15,243 --> 00:23:17,677
Go up. Don't keep the boss waiting.

371
00:23:18,013 --> 00:23:19,810
My old man, rest his uneasy soul,

372
00:23:19,881 --> 00:23:23,112
once said that the only time to raise
was before the draw.

373
00:23:23,185 --> 00:23:26,951
I always believed him after he took a club
to the back of my head.

374
00:23:27,022 --> 00:23:28,216
Raise.

375
00:23:29,891 --> 00:23:31,085
I'm in.

376
00:23:31,393 --> 00:23:33,156
- I'll stay.
- Out.

377
00:23:33,228 --> 00:23:36,095
- I think I'll take a test card.
- Let's have some action, boys.

378
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,132
I'm just a man who doesn't know
his own weakness.

379
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,134
That's possible.
- Maybe it could be you, Gracie.

380
00:23:40,202 --> 00:23:43,638
- Could be. There.
- Thank you.

381
00:23:43,705 --> 00:23:45,172
How many for you, Dan?

382
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,074
I think I'll just play those.
Come on, baby, let's watch this.

383
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,403
Two to the dealer and check.

384
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,243
Check.
Check.

385
00:23:53,315 --> 00:23:56,648
- Check to you, Dan.
- Okay. Here you are.

386
00:23:57,319 --> 00:23:58,946
Growl over that.

387
00:23:59,788 --> 00:24:01,050
I can't match that.

388
00:24:01,123 --> 00:24:05,617
I think you're lying, but I haven't
got nerve enough to find out for sure.

389
00:24:05,894 --> 00:24:09,694
Thanks, boys. Easy come, easy go.
Come on, Gracie. Take a handful.

390
00:24:09,764 --> 00:24:11,288
- Help yourself.
- Thank you!

391
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,027
Look at that, a pair of deuces.

392
00:24:13,101 --> 00:24:14,659
What a bluffer.

393
00:24:16,805 --> 00:24:18,898
Still pushing 'em.
- Oh, boy!

394
00:24:18,974 --> 00:24:20,339
Hello, Dan.

395
00:24:20,408 --> 00:24:23,673
Well, this is a surprise, Titus.
I didn't think you could make the stairs.

396
00:24:23,745 --> 00:24:26,145
I usually manage one way or another.

397
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,272
When it's worth your while.

398
00:24:28,817 --> 00:24:30,648
- How are you, boys?
How are you?

399
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,779
I'd like you to meet my deputy,
Field Carlisle. Dan Reynolds.

400
00:24:33,855 --> 00:24:36,517
- How do you do, sir?
- I knew your father, the judge, slightly.

401
00:24:36,591 --> 00:24:39,389
He did his best once to put me in jail.

402
00:24:39,461 --> 00:24:42,430
Come on over and meet the boys.
This is John Shelton from Brenton.

403
00:24:42,497 --> 00:24:43,657
- Mr. Shelton.
- How are you?

404
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,599
Link Niles from Marlack County.
Very, very shy.

405
00:24:46,668 --> 00:24:47,999
- Glad to meet you.
- How do you do, Mr. Niles?

406
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,663
Here's one of the best.
This is Ed Parker from Trondo.

407
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,104
- Mr. Parker.
- How are you, Field?

408
00:24:52,174 --> 00:24:53,732
Les Mitchell, Kentara County.

409
00:24:53,808 --> 00:24:55,673
- How do you do, sir?
- Glad to know you, sir.

410
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:56,870
Tom Hill from Lodge View.

411
00:24:56,945 --> 00:24:58,310
- How do you do, Mr. Hill?
- How do you do?

412
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,577
Oh, yes, and Gracie. Gracie!
Where are you from, sugar?

413
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:04,551
- I'm from Paducah.
- There we are, Gracie from Paducah.

414
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:06,849
Never would have guessed it.

415
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:10,722
I figured on finding all you boys
getting up a weekend frolic.

416
00:25:11,826 --> 00:25:14,454
So I just came down to tell you
how things is in my district.

417
00:25:14,529 --> 00:25:16,394
- How are things?
- Well, when Lockheart died,

418
00:25:16,464 --> 00:25:18,056
it sort of left a hole in the Legislature.

419
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:19,794
I figured to help you plug it up.

420
00:25:19,868 --> 00:25:22,063
We were half-thinking of Ed Morgan
taking the vacancy.

421
00:25:22,137 --> 00:25:23,934
Yes.
- Well, you can stop thinking now.

422
00:25:24,005 --> 00:25:25,302
I've done it for you.

423
00:25:25,373 --> 00:25:29,366
Since it's my district, I'm going to
put my deputy, Field, there.

424
00:25:31,012 --> 00:25:32,445
That's all right, Sheriff.
Sure.

425
00:25:32,514 --> 00:25:34,345
And now, Senator Carlisle,

426
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:37,510
you understand with what difficulty
a great public servant is born.

427
00:25:37,586 --> 00:25:38,644
How do you feel?

428
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,315
- Well, like the tail on a runaway kite.
- What you need is a drink.

429
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:43,880
I didn't come up here to talk politics.

430
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,654
- Let's get on with the game.
- I'm ready.

431
00:25:45,727 --> 00:25:46,819
Here.

432
00:25:46,895 --> 00:25:49,625
- Is this all there is to it?
- That's all.

433
00:25:49,698 --> 00:25:51,962
Oh, now and then
we have to help cut each other's bait.

434
00:25:52,033 --> 00:25:55,264
- You mean I'm Titus's minnow?
- Not exactly.

435
00:25:55,337 --> 00:25:59,330
- It could turn out that way if you let it.
- I figured you'd see things my way.

436
00:25:59,407 --> 00:26:01,637
Now I want to do something for you, Dan.

437
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:04,543
I've got some fine convict boys out
to my county farm.

438
00:26:04,613 --> 00:26:08,310
You could get them cheap
for that road job you're building.

439
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:11,785
At a dollar a day for the county
and a dollar and a half a day for you?

440
00:26:11,853 --> 00:26:14,879
- That's a nice good figure, Dan.
Deal you in, Titus?

441
00:26:14,956 --> 00:26:16,685
We'd like to take some of your money
home with us.

442
00:26:17,859 --> 00:26:20,259
Most of the county's been trying
to do that very thing for years.

443
00:26:21,396 --> 00:26:22,420
Ante up, boys.

444
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:23,521
- Okay.
What are you gonna play?

445
00:26:23,598 --> 00:26:26,328
You're a veteran, aren't you?
Yes, sir.

446
00:26:26,401 --> 00:26:29,495
Army or navy?
- Army. Fourth Division.

447
00:26:29,571 --> 00:26:31,266
You been around.

448
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,534
Well, that's all to the good.

449
00:26:34,442 --> 00:26:36,808
You can go a long way in this state
if you want to.

450
00:26:36,878 --> 00:26:40,814
You've got a good name and with Titus
backing you, you've got a good start.

451
00:26:40,882 --> 00:26:44,943
You stick with Titus.
And remember one thing.

452
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:49,252
He's the only man I know that can make
a sow's ear out of a silk purse.

453
00:26:49,324 --> 00:26:53,556
Somehow, I always hate to see it happen!
Here's luck to you, Senator!

454
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:56,220
Thanks. I appreciate that.

455
00:26:57,232 --> 00:26:59,530
All right, bub. Let's push off.

456
00:26:59,834 --> 00:27:01,358
- Sheriff?
- Yes?

457
00:27:03,672 --> 00:27:09,508
If I could be with you
I'd love you strong

458
00:27:09,978 --> 00:27:14,711
If I could be with you I'd love you long

459
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:21,780
I want you to know that I wouldn't go

460
00:27:21,856 --> 00:27:26,987
Until I told you, honey, that I love you so

461
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:33,194
If I could be with you one hour tonight

462
00:27:33,268 --> 00:27:37,136
If I was free to do the things I might

463
00:27:37,205 --> 00:27:39,639
- Hi, Sheriff!
- Millie!

464
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:42,802
I'm telling you true

465
00:27:43,778 --> 00:27:45,143
Hello, Lane.

466
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,171
Well, Sheriff,
I'm surprised to see you here.

467
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:50,240
I'm here on business. Political deal.

468
00:27:50,318 --> 00:27:52,286
- Oh.
- By yourself?

469
00:27:52,354 --> 00:27:54,788
No, I'm with Millie
and the two Rover Boys.

470
00:27:54,856 --> 00:27:57,051
That one over there bought me
a sandwich and a cup of coffee,

471
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:59,889
and now he's sore because he figures
it's money thrown away.

472
00:27:59,961 --> 00:28:02,191
- I see.
- What's this, Sheriff? A raid?

473
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:03,321
No.

474
00:28:03,398 --> 00:28:04,888
Come on. Let's go over here.

475
00:28:04,966 --> 00:28:06,991
All these machines are fixed.

476
00:28:07,068 --> 00:28:10,196
Hey, Lane. Let's get out of here.
You going with me?

477
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:11,431
No.

478
00:28:11,506 --> 00:28:13,599
Oh, you moving in, Field?

479
00:28:14,008 --> 00:28:15,839
Here's 80 cents
for my sandwich and coffee.

480
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:18,310
Let's have no hard feelings, huh?

481
00:28:18,847 --> 00:28:19,939
Hey!

482
00:28:20,882 --> 00:28:22,440
Wait a minute!

483
00:28:22,517 --> 00:28:24,007
- Millie...
Come on, let's get out of here!

484
00:28:24,085 --> 00:28:26,144
I think you better stay here
with your friends.

485
00:28:26,221 --> 00:28:29,088
I'm sure the sheriff will take me home.
I'll see you later.

486
00:28:29,157 --> 00:28:30,181
Well, all right.

487
00:28:30,258 --> 00:28:33,819
But I don't see why you had to go
and spoil a nice party.

488
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,673
What were you doing out
with the Simms boys?

489
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,305
I was afraid for a while
you weren't going to ask me.

490
00:28:54,382 --> 00:28:57,647
I thought maybe you didn't care
one way or another.

491
00:29:12,367 --> 00:29:16,326
I bet this is a pretty place by daylight.
What's the name of it?

492
00:29:18,773 --> 00:29:20,297
Shell Springs.

493
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,541
Is it really a spring?

494
00:29:27,215 --> 00:29:31,982
It's the only spring in the state that's
guaranteed to have no therapeutic value.

495
00:29:32,053 --> 00:29:34,521
Now can we forget the statistics?

496
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:39,520
It is getting late.
We'd better be getting back.

497
00:29:46,901 --> 00:29:48,766
Come on, Buffalo Bill.

498
00:30:02,784 --> 00:30:06,811
Somehow I wish you'd known
this was going to happen the way I did.

499
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:17,560
"The grossness
of Titus Semple's shadow

500
00:30:17,632 --> 00:30:21,568
"prevents us from describing it
as 'sinister,' but we call it 'evil. "'

501
00:30:21,636 --> 00:30:23,627
That's telling him.

502
00:30:23,705 --> 00:30:26,139
"In his shadow today
stands the scion

503
00:30:26,207 --> 00:30:28,505
"of one of the town's oldest families.

504
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:31,303
"For Fielding Carlisle,
we have only sympathy.

505
00:30:31,379 --> 00:30:34,075
"For the voters, we have only pity. "

506
00:30:34,148 --> 00:30:37,777
My, my, that Doc Waterson
sure can pour it on, can't he?

507
00:30:37,852 --> 00:30:39,581
- So long.
So long.

508
00:30:53,001 --> 00:30:56,402
- Sorry, Field.
- It's your paper.

509
00:30:57,505 --> 00:30:59,803
I've known you
since you were a youngster, son.

510
00:30:59,874 --> 00:31:02,069
Your father was a fine man.

511
00:31:02,143 --> 00:31:05,579
I never understood why you didn't
finish law school like he wanted.

512
00:31:05,647 --> 00:31:08,548
You never really looked good
wearing a deputy sheriff's badge.

513
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:11,050
Too much like a ring in your nose.

514
00:31:13,354 --> 00:31:14,616
Hey, bub!

515
00:31:20,762 --> 00:31:21,922
Ready?

516
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,323
Seen the Advertiser this morning?
The whole town's laughing.

517
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,369
Nobody but an idiot would read
that filthy sheet.

518
00:31:28,436 --> 00:31:31,894
One day Waterson's going too far out
on a limb, and when he does,

519
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:34,635
I'm gonna chop it off and him with it!

520
00:31:36,044 --> 00:31:39,810
Have you had that talk with Annabelle yet
about getting married?

521
00:31:39,881 --> 00:31:42,782
I kind of wanted to think about it
a couple of days.

522
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:44,943
Nothing to think about.

523
00:31:45,019 --> 00:31:47,385
You drop me over at the Palmer House

524
00:31:47,455 --> 00:31:51,152
and get over to that girl's house
and ask her to marry you.

525
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:07,065
I think it's just wonderful
your being a senator!

526
00:32:07,141 --> 00:32:09,336
I'm just as proud as I can be.

527
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:12,038
But that nasty Mr. Waterson
in the Advertiser!

528
00:32:12,113 --> 00:32:13,546
Papa says you should sue him.

529
00:32:13,615 --> 00:32:16,675
Even if you can't collect any money,
it'll teach him a lesson.

530
00:32:16,751 --> 00:32:20,585
But I don't see why you didn't tell me
about it before I read it in the paper.

531
00:32:20,655 --> 00:32:22,282
You could've called me last night.

532
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,587
Well, it was late last night.
It was awful late.

533
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:27,150
Next thing I know, you'll just pick up
and go off to Olympic City

534
00:32:27,228 --> 00:32:29,355
and that's the last I'll hear of you.

535
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:31,193
Well, I'm not elected yet.

536
00:32:31,265 --> 00:32:35,258
Papa says anybody who's got the sheriff
behind him gets elected.

537
00:32:36,504 --> 00:32:39,701
We've known each other
for a long time, Annabelle.

538
00:32:40,008 --> 00:32:42,238
I've just been thinking that
it would be a good idea

539
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:45,108
if you and I went to Olympic City together.

540
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:49,946
They tell me that any young man going
into politics is supposed to get married.

541
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,311
Field, darling!

542
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:56,049
I do love you so!

543
00:32:56,591 --> 00:33:01,688
And I am so proud of you!
Mrs. Senator Fielding Carlisle.

544
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:04,758
Norma Henderson will just be livid.

545
00:33:04,832 --> 00:33:08,734
Although I don't suppose anyone
will be surprised and that's half the fun.

546
00:33:08,803 --> 00:33:10,395
I have a million things to do.

547
00:33:10,471 --> 00:33:12,496
The reception
and our announcements to get out.

548
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,200
And Papa says we'll have
to do some entertaining

549
00:33:14,275 --> 00:33:15,799
to interest the nice people in you.

550
00:33:15,877 --> 00:33:19,438
He says you'll have to move right back
here to Flamingo Road where you belong.

551
00:33:19,514 --> 00:33:21,846
I thought you'd never get around
to asking me.

552
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:22,905
Neither did I.

553
00:33:23,351 --> 00:33:24,511
Oh, Field!

554
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,313
He's not here. No.

555
00:33:28,856 --> 00:33:31,689
Oh, yes, he is. I mean, he just come in.

556
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,351
- Hello, Pete.
- Hello, Field.

557
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:36,795
You wanna talk to him? Oh.

558
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,033
Oh, okay.

559
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:43,332
No, no, I don't ask no questions.
You are the boss.

560
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,809
Hello, Senator.

561
00:33:50,878 --> 00:33:53,676
The Advertiser must have quite
a circulation in Boldon.

562
00:33:53,748 --> 00:33:55,272
What do you care what they said.

563
00:33:55,349 --> 00:33:58,284
Just reading your name
made me proud of you. Hungry?

564
00:33:58,352 --> 00:33:59,376
No, thanks.

565
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:03,185
- Coffee, huh?
- Yeah, maybe some coffee.

566
00:34:03,257 --> 00:34:07,091
Look, there's something I've got to tell you
and I don't quite know how to do it.

567
00:34:07,161 --> 00:34:09,061
It's about you and me.

568
00:34:10,431 --> 00:34:12,331
I'm gonna get married.

569
00:34:15,036 --> 00:34:17,266
You knew this last night, huh?

570
00:34:17,672 --> 00:34:21,870
Lane, please try to understand.
I'm not sure of anything.

571
00:34:22,677 --> 00:34:25,305
I'm trying to do what I think is right.

572
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:28,940
It must be right,
otherwise it wouldn't be so hard to do.

573
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:31,180
Yeah, I suppose so.

574
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:37,488
I'm almost glad in a way.
Sounds funny, doesn't it?

575
00:34:38,025 --> 00:34:40,425
Sounds funny to me when I say it.

576
00:34:41,229 --> 00:34:43,993
But now we don't have to watch
anything die.

577
00:34:44,065 --> 00:34:46,499
That's what we would have had to do.

578
00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:49,866
The waitress at the Eagle Cafe
and Senator Carlisle.

579
00:34:51,572 --> 00:34:53,369
I'll get your coffee.

580
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:22,191
- Where'd he go?
- Field? I guess he changed his mind.

581
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:26,434
- Sit down, drink your coffee.
- No, thanks. I don't want it.

582
00:35:26,808 --> 00:35:30,608
- I got to let you go, Lane.
- You mean I'm fired?

583
00:35:30,678 --> 00:35:35,012
- Well, business ain't been so good lately.
- Business has been fine.

584
00:35:35,082 --> 00:35:37,243
And if you let me go,
you'll only have to get another girl.

585
00:35:37,318 --> 00:35:39,912
The job is not really good
like used to be.

586
00:35:39,987 --> 00:35:44,424
- Tips ain't much and the food is rotten.
- The job is good and I want to keep it.

587
00:35:44,492 --> 00:35:46,187
I've got to keep it,
don't you understand that?

588
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:50,060
I'm sorry, but it's just the way I said.
Business ain't good.

589
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,560
- Okay, I won't make it tough on you.
- You are a nice girl.

590
00:35:55,636 --> 00:35:57,763
Someone else might carry on
and cry maybe.

591
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:01,969
- I don't cry, Pete.
- Here, this is for the week.

592
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:06,179
And $10 more on account
I didn't give you no notice.

593
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:07,680
Thanks.

594
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:12,845
Look, I'd like to bet you this that
you won't tell me why I was fired.

595
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,715
That's a hard bet to refuse.

596
00:36:21,062 --> 00:36:22,859
- Yes, Miss?
- I'm looking for a job.

597
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,296
- I'd like to put an ad in your paper.
- I know you.

598
00:36:25,366 --> 00:36:27,834
You're that carnival girl
who took a job at the Eagle Cafe.

599
00:36:27,902 --> 00:36:29,836
- Yes.
- Come in.

600
00:36:29,904 --> 00:36:31,701
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

601
00:36:33,908 --> 00:36:36,274
- Now, what happened?
- I got fired.

602
00:36:36,344 --> 00:36:38,369
I know, but what's the story?

603
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:41,643
- That's all there is to it. I got fired.
- That isn't all there is to it.

604
00:36:41,716 --> 00:36:44,446
And advertising for a job
isn't going to do you any good.

605
00:36:44,518 --> 00:36:46,349
You're not gonna get a job in Boldon.

606
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,581
Or if you do,
you're not gonna be able to keep it.

607
00:36:48,656 --> 00:36:50,214
I don't understand what you mean.

608
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,485
I think maybe you can find the answer

609
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:54,426
sitting on the porch over there
at the Palmer House.

610
00:36:54,495 --> 00:36:57,589
- You mean the Sheriff had me canned?
- That's it.

611
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:02,766
Well, then it wouldn't be any use
putting an ad in your paper.

612
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,662
Are you sure you know
what you're talking about?

613
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:07,867
I'm a newspaper man. I always check
the source of my information.

614
00:37:07,942 --> 00:37:11,571
If you don't mind, I think
I'll do the same thing. Thanks.

615
00:37:29,697 --> 00:37:32,393
I know you're not asleep.
You don't have to pretend you are!

616
00:37:32,466 --> 00:37:33,956
How are you, Miss Bellamy?

617
00:37:34,035 --> 00:37:36,401
Did you have me fired
from the Eagle Cafe?

618
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:39,405
Did you have it fixed so I couldn't
get another job in this town?

619
00:37:39,473 --> 00:37:41,668
There wasn't really anything personal in it.

620
00:37:41,742 --> 00:37:44,404
It's personal to me
if I don't have a place to eat or sleep.

621
00:37:44,478 --> 00:37:45,706
I reckon it would be.

622
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,941
I'm a quiet man, Miss Bellamy.

623
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:50,950
When I see trouble coming, I try to duck it.

624
00:37:51,419 --> 00:37:55,685
Now, with you and Field Carlisle,
I just can't see nothing but trouble.

625
00:37:55,756 --> 00:37:57,553
I don't mean anything to Field Carlisle.

626
00:37:57,625 --> 00:37:59,991
If I did, he wouldn't be getting married,
would he?

627
00:38:00,061 --> 00:38:03,394
I just don't want to take
any chances, Miss Bellamy.

628
00:38:03,764 --> 00:38:06,232
Field's going to the State Senate.

629
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,860
One of these days,
he's going to be Governor.

630
00:38:08,936 --> 00:38:13,532
A man like that's got to get married,
stay married, happily married.

631
00:38:13,607 --> 00:38:16,041
That's fine, but I've got a right to live, too!

632
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:20,046
You know, when I was a young fellow,
I once had a job at a warehouse.

633
00:38:20,114 --> 00:38:23,379
There were rats there.
I didn't pay no attention to them.

634
00:38:23,451 --> 00:38:27,785
One night, though, I went to sleep
and a rat near half chewed my big toe off

635
00:38:27,855 --> 00:38:30,255
before I knew what was happening.

636
00:38:30,324 --> 00:38:33,782
After that I went around
and plugged up all the holes.

637
00:38:33,861 --> 00:38:37,797
And as long as I kept the holes plugged,
I didn't have nothing to worry about.

638
00:38:37,865 --> 00:38:40,698
That's how I kept my toes all these years.

639
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:43,396
I won't be run out of town this way.

640
00:38:43,471 --> 00:38:46,440
I'm gonna stay here and get another job.
Any kind of a job.

641
00:38:46,507 --> 00:38:48,975
I'm gonna stay here if it kills me!

642
00:38:49,443 --> 00:38:52,071
You may do just that, Miss Bellamy.

643
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,205
One more move shouldn't be
so hard to take.

644
00:38:55,282 --> 00:38:59,048
- You've been a carnival girl.
- I'm not a carnival girl anymore.

645
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,317
You sure been acting like it
with young Carlisle.

646
00:39:04,058 --> 00:39:06,822
I'm not running. Do you understand that?

647
00:39:07,661 --> 00:39:10,528
I'm sure sorry you did that, Miss Bellamy.

648
00:39:39,193 --> 00:39:40,592
I beg your pardon.

649
00:39:40,661 --> 00:39:42,822
Hey, what are you doing
walking the streets this time of night?

650
00:39:42,897 --> 00:39:45,388
- I'm on my way home.
- Oh, yeah?

651
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,058
Say, who are you and what do you want?

652
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:49,193
Does this mean anything to you?
- No, it doesn't.

653
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:50,259
This girl giving you any trouble,
Lieutenant?

654
00:39:50,337 --> 00:39:52,134
Yeah, she tried to pick me up.
Let's get her to the station.

655
00:39:52,206 --> 00:39:53,571
What kind of a deal is this?
I haven't done anything.

656
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:54,699
I can go easy in court
or make it tough on yourself,

657
00:39:54,775 --> 00:39:56,208
- I don't care which!
But you can't put me in there!

658
00:39:56,277 --> 00:39:58,268
All right! Let's go, Mac!

659
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:09,018
- Hello, Pete.
- Field, I am glad to see you again.

660
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:11,786
From everywhere you go,
I hear you make a fine election speeches.

661
00:40:11,859 --> 00:40:14,692
Thanks. I understand Lane
isn't working here anymore.

662
00:40:14,762 --> 00:40:17,526
- Why'd you let her go?
- Well, business was not so good.

663
00:40:17,598 --> 00:40:19,088
I notice you got another girl.

664
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,100
Well, business picked up.
You know how it is.

665
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,192
Yeah.

666
00:40:22,269 --> 00:40:24,203
- You don't know where she is, do you?
- I don't.

667
00:40:24,271 --> 00:40:27,763
- Maybe perhaps Millie, she knows.
- All right.

668
00:40:32,379 --> 00:40:35,007
She just disappeared,
didn't come home one night.

669
00:40:35,082 --> 00:40:37,380
Even left what little clothes
she had in the room.

670
00:40:37,451 --> 00:40:38,748
I tell you, Field, I was worried.

671
00:40:38,819 --> 00:40:41,583
I thought something might have
happened to her.

672
00:40:41,655 --> 00:40:44,624
And then I got to thinking.
She must have just left town.

673
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,956
That was when you were away
orating for votes.

674
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:49,359
But you got more important things
to think about now, Field,

675
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:51,489
what with getting married next week.

676
00:40:51,565 --> 00:40:55,126
Suppose I ought to offer you
my congratulations, Senator.

677
00:40:56,637 --> 00:40:57,831
Thanks.

678
00:41:02,109 --> 00:41:03,667
See you again, Field.

679
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:07,874
Mr. Pete, do we charge extra
for a second cup of coffee?

680
00:41:08,582 --> 00:41:11,915
No, no, no! A cup of coffee...

681
00:41:23,831 --> 00:41:27,528
- You get out tomorrow or Thursday?
- Thursday.

682
00:41:27,601 --> 00:41:30,331
Did you ever stop to think how it is?
The judge can never say anything

683
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:35,000
but "thirty days!" "Thirty days!"
You'd think it'd get monotonous.

684
00:41:35,943 --> 00:41:38,343
You never did say what you was in for.

685
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:41,347
They said I was trying to pick up
men on the streets.

686
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:42,848
How about you?

687
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:46,114
My boyfriend cut himself on a knife
I was holding.

688
00:41:48,355 --> 00:41:50,516
What are you gonna do when you get out?

689
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:54,186
Go back to Boldon, I guess.
Try to get a job if I can.

690
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:55,592
Boldon?

691
00:41:55,663 --> 00:41:59,064
I know a good place you can get a job
in Boldon. I used to work there.

692
00:41:59,133 --> 00:42:02,193
- A road house called Lute Mae's.
- Yeah.

693
00:42:03,537 --> 00:42:07,906
- It sounds like a good setup.
- It was. I waited tables, served drinks.

694
00:42:07,975 --> 00:42:10,443
A lot of big shots go there. Big tips.

695
00:42:10,511 --> 00:42:13,275
There ain't no cops gonna pick you up,
either, if you work for Lute Mae.

696
00:42:13,347 --> 00:42:15,838
She's just like that with
all the politicians and big shots,

697
00:42:15,916 --> 00:42:17,349
from the Governor on down!

698
00:42:20,521 --> 00:42:23,922
Just tell Lute Mae I sent you.
Only don't say where you met me.

699
00:42:23,991 --> 00:42:27,825
She always told me I'd wind up in the can
and I'd hate for her to be right!

700
00:42:27,895 --> 00:42:29,192
Shut up!

701
00:42:29,263 --> 00:42:30,423
Ah!

702
00:43:20,781 --> 00:43:23,306
When I was very young,
I made up my mind to be rich.

703
00:43:23,384 --> 00:43:26,876
How'd you make out?
- I found it was better to change my mind.

704
00:43:26,954 --> 00:43:29,514
Frankly, I'm broke and I need a job.

705
00:43:30,724 --> 00:43:34,285
Sugar or lemon?
- Oh, no tea for me. Thank you.

706
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:39,264
Me, neither. My tonic.
Sure wish I could drink tea.

707
00:43:39,333 --> 00:43:42,200
The things make the room
look so cozy and genteel.

708
00:43:42,269 --> 00:43:45,204
But I can't stand the stuff.
It gives me gas.

709
00:43:45,639 --> 00:43:49,166
You say you can't get a job anyplace
else in town? Why?

710
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:54,276
I've been at the county farm.
There's a piece in the paper about me.

711
00:43:54,615 --> 00:43:55,775
I never read the paper.

712
00:43:55,849 --> 00:43:59,307
If I don't know what's going on,
I can't worry about it.

713
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:02,321
I sure wish those girls weren't so talented.

714
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:04,983
I can serve drinks and wait on table.

715
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:08,859
- And in a pinch, I can even sing a little bit.
- Yeah, I was afraid of that.

716
00:44:08,929 --> 00:44:11,363
I'd like to know why you're lying.

717
00:44:11,965 --> 00:44:13,193
I'm not lying.

718
00:44:13,267 --> 00:44:16,896
You're not lying in what you say.
It's what you don't say.

719
00:44:18,439 --> 00:44:21,340
You know, I've got a hunch about you
and it scares me.

720
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:24,241
I think you'll make trouble for me
one of these days.

721
00:44:24,311 --> 00:44:28,577
You're moody.
And the moody kind always cause trouble.

722
00:44:32,219 --> 00:44:34,619
- Gracie!
- Coming!

723
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:40,959
- Did you want me, Miss Lute Mae?
- This here's Lane Bellamy.

724
00:44:41,028 --> 00:44:42,655
- Hi!
- Hello!

725
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:45,824
- She can room with you, Gracie.
- You gonna work here, honey?

726
00:44:45,899 --> 00:44:48,163
- Well, I...
- Take her back to see Frank.

727
00:44:48,235 --> 00:44:50,669
He'll get you a uniform
and tell you what to do.

728
00:44:50,738 --> 00:44:53,366
I'm sure I've got one that fits you, honey.

729
00:44:55,509 --> 00:44:56,737
Thanks.

730
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:19,790
Peterson! Do you know why
I'm not gonna let you go to jail?

731
00:45:19,867 --> 00:45:21,732
I've spent a long time building up
this organization

732
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:24,396
and I'm not going to break it down
for some five-and-10-cent chiseler.

733
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:27,201
Now, listen, Reynolds...
- You'll resign for reasons of ill health.

734
00:45:27,274 --> 00:45:31,005
Because if you're not sick now,
you will be when I get through with you.

735
00:45:31,078 --> 00:45:33,069
Deal me out. I'm out.

736
00:45:33,447 --> 00:45:35,711
Peterson's a good superintendent
of hospitals.

737
00:45:35,783 --> 00:45:37,910
I wouldn't want to lose him.

738
00:45:38,385 --> 00:45:41,877
If he's not smart enough to steal
and stay in the clear, he gets dumped.

739
00:45:41,955 --> 00:45:44,822
Dan, I ain't going to like losing Peterson.

740
00:45:45,125 --> 00:45:47,992
We had them hospitals
with the contracts for heat, light,

741
00:45:48,061 --> 00:45:52,020
and all the supplies paying off good.
I don't aim to lose him.

742
00:45:54,201 --> 00:45:57,967
- Getting a bit out of line, aren't you, Titus?
- I got big feet, Dan.

743
00:45:58,038 --> 00:46:00,973
If I ever step out of line, you'll see them.

744
00:46:01,041 --> 00:46:04,568
I'm not going to have an investigation
in an election year. He's out!

745
00:46:04,645 --> 00:46:08,342
And you'll let him go quietly
or you'll both go. Like that!

746
00:46:10,083 --> 00:46:12,643
Come on, let's get on with the game.

747
00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:41,445
Mr. Reynolds' party. Two Old Fashioneds.

748
00:46:44,017 --> 00:46:45,450
Gracie!
- Yes, Miss Lute Mae.

749
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:47,282
Table 22, a special.

750
00:46:47,821 --> 00:46:48,981
You're leaving early.

751
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:51,524
How long you got that Bellamy girl
working here?

752
00:46:51,592 --> 00:46:54,060
- Why?
- She done time, county time.

753
00:46:54,495 --> 00:46:57,293
How do you figure to improve
the reputation of your place?

754
00:46:57,364 --> 00:47:00,162
I lost that some time around
the Spanish-American War.

755
00:47:01,301 --> 00:47:03,098
Maybe you ought to get rid of her.

756
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:05,661
Somebody might complain
to the authorities.

757
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:08,333
When you walk through that door,
I'm the authority.

758
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:09,466
Besides, I like her.

759
00:47:09,543 --> 00:47:12,171
And knowing you don't
makes me like her twice as much.

760
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:14,373
Just figured to be friendly.

761
00:47:14,448 --> 00:47:17,281
I'll bet. Hurry up with that order, girls.

762
00:47:27,895 --> 00:47:30,557
Why is Titus Semple interested in you?

763
00:47:30,631 --> 00:47:33,122
- Is he?
- I expect a straight answer.

764
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,863
- What did you ever do to him?
- Nothing.

765
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:41,567
He just told me I ought to can you.
What did he do that for?

766
00:47:41,642 --> 00:47:44,270
- I don't know.
- You're lying.

767
00:47:44,745 --> 00:47:46,508
That's right, I am.

768
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,508
He thought Field Carlisle
was interested in me.

769
00:47:49,583 --> 00:47:52,279
I was wondering when you'd get around
to tell the truth about that.

770
00:47:52,352 --> 00:47:56,755
I'm not interested in what's happened.
I'm interested in what may happen.

771
00:47:58,191 --> 00:48:01,683
- You still in love with Field?
- He's married.

772
00:48:01,762 --> 00:48:03,593
Are you or aren't you?

773
00:48:05,566 --> 00:48:06,999
I don't know.

774
00:48:08,602 --> 00:48:13,301
- Well, what are you going to do about it?
- I'm not firing you, am I?

775
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:17,337
- Aren't you?
- No, I'm not.

776
00:48:18,445 --> 00:48:23,508
Most of the time, I don't like people.
Most of the time, I don't trust them at all.

777
00:48:23,584 --> 00:48:25,211
Especially women.

778
00:48:25,786 --> 00:48:27,651
I must be getting old.

779
00:48:28,555 --> 00:48:30,648
It's going to be
a pretty rugged party up there.

780
00:48:30,724 --> 00:48:32,453
Keep an eye on Dan.

781
00:48:32,526 --> 00:48:36,018
See that he don't get in trouble
or burn the place down.

782
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:37,724
Thanks.

783
00:49:23,871 --> 00:49:25,998
- What's that stuff?
- Daylight.

784
00:49:26,073 --> 00:49:28,564
Well, turn it off. I don't like it.

785
00:49:28,642 --> 00:49:30,507
- Feel awful?
- Terrible.

786
00:49:33,013 --> 00:49:34,674
How did I end up in here?

787
00:49:34,748 --> 00:49:37,979
Well, it took a bit of doing
but I finally managed.

788
00:49:38,619 --> 00:49:41,554
- I really tied one on last night, didn't I?
- Mmm-hmm.

789
00:49:42,723 --> 00:49:44,190
Here you are.

790
00:49:44,525 --> 00:49:45,924
- What's that?
- Whiskey Sour.

791
00:49:45,993 --> 00:49:48,553
- Oh, no!
- Oh, yes. Go on, drink it.

792
00:49:49,163 --> 00:49:50,562
How do you know about these things?

793
00:49:50,631 --> 00:49:53,657
I read about them once
in a bartender's manual.

794
00:50:02,743 --> 00:50:03,971
Better?

795
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:07,340
Better.

796
00:50:08,015 --> 00:50:09,607
- What's your name?
- Lane.

797
00:50:09,683 --> 00:50:13,517
- No, no, I mean your first name.
- That's my first name, Lane.

798
00:50:14,355 --> 00:50:17,813
Well, it was mighty nice of you
to take care of me, Lane.

799
00:50:17,892 --> 00:50:20,759
I still don't see
how you managed it or why.

800
00:50:21,729 --> 00:50:24,459
Not because I'm pretty, that's for sure.

801
00:50:25,165 --> 00:50:29,124
Lute Mae told me to take care of you.
She said you were very important.

802
00:50:29,203 --> 00:50:32,366
- Are you important?
- I don't feel very important.

803
00:50:32,873 --> 00:50:36,104
Look at the score board.
I don't behave like this all the time.

804
00:50:36,176 --> 00:50:39,407
Just once a year after elections,
purge my soul.

805
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:41,675
I've got a soul that needs lots of purging.

806
00:50:41,749 --> 00:50:44,479
- Well, your candidates won, didn't they?
- Mmm-hmm.

807
00:50:44,551 --> 00:50:46,746
- They always win?
- Just about always.

808
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:49,482
If they didn't,
I wouldn't be important anymore.

809
00:50:49,556 --> 00:50:52,650
Look, honey, honey,
I've got an awful hangover.

810
00:50:53,193 --> 00:50:54,387
Sorry.

811
00:50:54,795 --> 00:50:57,923
- Can I wash up in there?
- Certainly, help yourself.

812
00:50:57,998 --> 00:51:00,660
My old man warned me
there'd be mornings like this.

813
00:51:00,734 --> 00:51:03,999
You're pretty careless with your money,
aren't you?

814
00:51:13,147 --> 00:51:14,375
Thanks.

815
00:51:15,916 --> 00:51:20,410
- Is Field Carlisle a good man?
- Carlisle, yeah. I guess he's all right.

816
00:51:21,522 --> 00:51:23,046
You would know if he wasn't,
wouldn't you?

817
00:51:23,123 --> 00:51:25,182
I mean, you helped get him elected,
didn't you?

818
00:51:25,259 --> 00:51:27,352
Titus seems to have a lot of faith in him.

819
00:51:27,428 --> 00:51:29,828
Would you consider that
a recommendation?

820
00:51:29,897 --> 00:51:31,762
You sure ask a lot of questions.

821
00:51:31,832 --> 00:51:34,027
Someone once told me that
it was one way to get answers.

822
00:51:34,101 --> 00:51:37,468
- Where the devil is that towel?
- Here it is.

823
00:51:41,141 --> 00:51:43,632
I'm beginning to feel almost human.

824
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:47,272
Say,

825
00:51:48,415 --> 00:51:50,940
you know, you're a very pretty girl.

826
00:51:52,853 --> 00:51:54,616
I guess I am human.

827
00:51:55,022 --> 00:51:57,115
I'll get you some breakfast.

828
00:51:58,325 --> 00:52:01,192
Don't tell me you can cook, too?
- Uh-huh.

829
00:52:04,431 --> 00:52:05,955
The way you talk,
I don't see much difference

830
00:52:06,033 --> 00:52:08,092
between politics and a carnival pitch.

831
00:52:08,168 --> 00:52:10,227
How come you're so interested in politics?

832
00:52:10,304 --> 00:52:12,272
Just trying to improve my education,
I guess.

833
00:52:12,339 --> 00:52:14,432
It wasn't much of an education
to begin with.

834
00:52:14,508 --> 00:52:18,569
- You sure learned to cook.
- You learn a lot of things in a carnival.

835
00:52:18,645 --> 00:52:21,546
- How are you feeling, Dan?
- Terrible.

836
00:52:21,615 --> 00:52:22,946
This man been annoying you?

837
00:52:23,017 --> 00:52:25,076
As a matter of fact,
she's been bothering me.

838
00:52:25,152 --> 00:52:27,848
She can handle a drunk and
make a whiskey sour and cook bacon.

839
00:52:27,921 --> 00:52:29,115
Crisp.

840
00:52:29,323 --> 00:52:31,985
A man's got to know more
about a gal like that.

841
00:52:32,059 --> 00:52:33,822
- Get me a cup of coffee, will you?
- Sure.

842
00:52:33,894 --> 00:52:37,091
I've got a hangover just from opening
bottles for you last night.

843
00:52:37,164 --> 00:52:39,655
- Did you have fun?
- Honey, fun is like insurance.

844
00:52:39,733 --> 00:52:42,201
The older you get, the more it costs.

845
00:52:42,269 --> 00:52:45,295
Do you mind if Lane drives me down
to my construction job?

846
00:52:45,372 --> 00:52:47,101
I'm afraid I'll fall asleep at the wheel.

847
00:52:47,174 --> 00:52:49,005
When I asked you to keep
an eye on him last night,

848
00:52:49,076 --> 00:52:51,510
I didn't mean you had to room
together all through college.

849
00:52:51,578 --> 00:52:54,843
How about it, Lane?
- Well, if it's all right with Lute Mae?

850
00:52:54,915 --> 00:52:59,409
I swear, I don't know whether I'm running
a road house or a get-acquainted society.

851
00:52:59,486 --> 00:53:00,783
Oh, go ahead.

852
00:53:00,854 --> 00:53:03,687
Let's go while we still have her blessing.

853
00:53:08,595 --> 00:53:11,120
Wake me up when we pass Trondo.

854
00:53:11,198 --> 00:53:13,029
Now I know
why you wanted me to come along.

855
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,415
Well, there it is.

856
00:53:36,356 --> 00:53:38,847
With all this,
how do you ever find time for politics?

857
00:53:38,926 --> 00:53:42,453
Honey, I couldn't move
a load of gravel without politics.

858
00:53:42,529 --> 00:53:45,726
When I first started my construction
company, I discovered that the fat jobs,

859
00:53:45,799 --> 00:53:48,427
the big money jobs,
are going to other people.

860
00:53:48,502 --> 00:53:49,696
I needed connections and I found

861
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:52,637
the only connections I could trust
were the ones I made myself.

862
00:53:52,706 --> 00:53:54,731
So, I began to get men elected
here and there.

863
00:53:54,808 --> 00:53:55,968
It was pretty simple.

864
00:53:56,043 --> 00:53:58,409
Do the people always elect
the men you want?

865
00:53:58,479 --> 00:54:02,040
The people haven't elected anyone in this
state for so long, they've lost the habit.

866
00:54:02,116 --> 00:54:03,640
It's a lot of trouble to go to the polls.

867
00:54:03,717 --> 00:54:07,153
Usually it interferes
with a baseball game or a fishing trip.

868
00:54:07,221 --> 00:54:10,782
When people don't care,
they get about what they deserve.

869
00:54:11,024 --> 00:54:12,924
Meaning a Dan Reynolds?

870
00:54:13,427 --> 00:54:15,327
Yeah, that's about it.

871
00:54:15,629 --> 00:54:16,994
Hi ya, Dan.

872
00:54:17,164 --> 00:54:19,758
Hi ya, Burr. Come on over and meet Burr.

873
00:54:21,068 --> 00:54:22,933
It's good to see you.
- Everything on schedule?

874
00:54:23,003 --> 00:54:24,903
Well, we hit rock yesterday.
We had to blast.

875
00:54:24,972 --> 00:54:27,668
Lane, this is Burr Lassen.
He's head of all our construction.

876
00:54:27,741 --> 00:54:29,231
- Been with me 10 years.
- Hello.

877
00:54:29,309 --> 00:54:30,970
Pleased to meet you.
Well, I'll be seeing you.

878
00:54:31,044 --> 00:54:32,773
Okay. Come on,
let's get something cold to drink.

879
00:54:32,846 --> 00:54:35,144
- Be with you in a minute!
Okay!

880
00:54:35,883 --> 00:54:38,545
This is what we call home.
Not good, not bad.

881
00:54:38,619 --> 00:54:40,177
I've seen worse.

882
00:54:43,157 --> 00:54:46,183
What'd I do with it.
I thought I had some change here.

883
00:54:48,095 --> 00:54:49,187
Here.

884
00:54:56,069 --> 00:54:59,835
This is the first time since I was a kid
that anyone has ever given me anything.

885
00:54:59,907 --> 00:55:02,034
It's an interesting switch.

886
00:55:05,512 --> 00:55:08,242
And everything about you is interesting.

887
00:55:09,316 --> 00:55:12,149
The more I see you, the less I understand.

888
00:55:15,923 --> 00:55:19,120
There's something inside you
that just won't give.

889
00:55:21,228 --> 00:55:26,131
If I were going to be around a little longer,
maybe I could try and figure you out.

890
00:55:30,904 --> 00:55:33,805
- Going away?
- New York. Probably Washington.

891
00:55:34,274 --> 00:55:35,366
Oh.

892
00:55:35,809 --> 00:55:38,039
- Be gone long?
- Quite a while.

893
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:42,244
I guess today is goodbye then.

894
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:44,745
Yes, I guess it is.

895
00:55:52,492 --> 00:55:54,517
I'm crazy about you, Lane.

896
00:56:02,536 --> 00:56:04,367
What's your last name?

897
00:56:12,446 --> 00:56:15,506
- Senator Blangsted.
- Afternoon, Senator Carlisle.

898
00:56:15,582 --> 00:56:17,880
- Have you come to a decision yet?
- Decision?

899
00:56:17,951 --> 00:56:19,441
Well, about appointing me
to the power commission.

900
00:56:19,519 --> 00:56:22,044
You remember, about six weeks ago,
you said for me to be patient.

901
00:56:22,122 --> 00:56:23,714
And I still say be patient.

902
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:27,590
You're young, my boy. Why, you've only
been with us two, or is it three months?

903
00:56:27,661 --> 00:56:31,097
- Now, it took me four years to...
- Hey, bub, come here.

904
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,795
Excuse me, Senator.

905
00:56:35,736 --> 00:56:39,297
I don't want you to make a nuisance
of yourself by asking favors.

906
00:56:39,373 --> 00:56:41,773
People always expect to be paid back.

907
00:56:41,842 --> 00:56:44,970
- Tell the driver to take us to the hotel.
Twenty-third and Second Avenue.

908
00:56:49,116 --> 00:56:53,075
Mr. Reynolds.
Paging Mr. Dan Reynolds, please.

909
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:57,750
Mr. Reynolds. Paging Mr. Dan Reynolds.
Mr. Dan Reynolds, please.

910
00:56:57,824 --> 00:57:00,486
Not a very interesting session,
was it?

911
00:57:00,761 --> 00:57:02,661
- Excuse me.
- Okay, Sheriff.

912
00:57:03,363 --> 00:57:05,593
- Yes, Sheriff Semple?
- Dan Reynolds in town?

913
00:57:05,666 --> 00:57:07,634
Yes, sir.
Flew in this afternoon from New York.

914
00:57:07,701 --> 00:57:09,726
I'm saving his table, 22.

915
00:57:17,844 --> 00:57:20,369
Better slow down, bub.
Dan Reynolds is in town.

916
00:57:20,447 --> 00:57:24,349
- What am I supposed to do, salute?
- What's the matter with you, bub?

917
00:57:24,418 --> 00:57:28,479
I guess I'm just a little sick of being stuck
in a corner and not getting anyplace.

918
00:57:28,555 --> 00:57:31,490
The only thing I've done in that whole
session is to make one little speech,

919
00:57:31,558 --> 00:57:33,492
and then there were
three people in the house.

920
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,687
I was there.
- All right, four.

921
00:57:35,762 --> 00:57:37,992
Don't go jumping out of your britches.

922
00:57:38,065 --> 00:57:40,295
Remember I told you
I was planning to skin me a bear?

923
00:57:40,367 --> 00:57:44,030
Well, it's a big bear
and I'm taking my time in the skinning.

924
00:57:44,104 --> 00:57:48,165
One of these days, when I think you are
ready, I'm gonna make you Governor.

925
00:57:48,241 --> 00:57:52,041
That's what I've been aiming at.
I never had me a governor before.

926
00:57:56,016 --> 00:57:57,347
I'm sorry I'm late.

927
00:57:57,417 --> 00:57:59,715
Evening, Annabelle. You look real smart.

928
00:57:59,786 --> 00:58:02,550
I look awful.
You needn't tell me, I know I do.

929
00:58:02,622 --> 00:58:04,249
My hair's half done.

930
00:58:04,324 --> 00:58:05,985
But I found out in the beauty shop today

931
00:58:06,059 --> 00:58:09,426
just how much it means
to be a senator's wife in this town!

932
00:58:09,496 --> 00:58:11,964
They gave my appointment
to Dan Reynolds' new lady friend.

933
00:58:12,032 --> 00:58:16,833
Dan's lady friends last such a short time
that folks are obliged to be polite to them.

934
00:58:16,903 --> 00:58:20,236
This one is something special.
The girl in the beauty shop told me.

935
00:58:20,307 --> 00:58:21,831
He brought her back with him
from New York

936
00:58:21,908 --> 00:58:24,274
and she's got enough clothes,
furs and jewels

937
00:58:24,344 --> 00:58:27,040
to start a department store of her own.

938
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,417
What's the matter with you?

939
00:58:34,488 --> 00:58:35,955
- Good evening, Mr. Reynolds.
- Hello, Maurice.

940
00:58:36,022 --> 00:58:40,254
Well, I'm glad to see you back.
I've saved your regular table for you.

941
00:58:40,594 --> 00:58:42,323
Just a moment, dear.

942
00:58:42,596 --> 00:58:43,995
- Hello, Titus.
Hello, Dan.

943
00:58:44,064 --> 00:58:47,124
How are you, Field?
Mrs. Carlisle, nice to see you.

944
00:58:56,042 --> 00:58:57,407
Cocktails, Mr. Reynolds?

945
00:58:57,477 --> 00:58:59,240
No, I think you might bring
some champagne.

946
00:58:59,312 --> 00:59:01,906
- We'll order a little later.
- Very well, sir.

947
00:59:01,982 --> 00:59:04,382
Cordon Rouge, Mr. Reynolds' table.

948
00:59:05,152 --> 00:59:09,646
Dan, surprised to see you back.
And if it isn't Miss Bellamy.

949
00:59:10,157 --> 00:59:11,590
Sit down, Titus.

950
00:59:11,658 --> 00:59:14,126
Knew you had been running
between New York and Washington

951
00:59:14,194 --> 00:59:15,752
for the last three months.

952
00:59:15,829 --> 00:59:18,525
I hardly figured you'd come back
without telling me,

953
00:59:18,598 --> 00:59:20,589
us working together for so long.

954
00:59:20,667 --> 00:59:21,861
Lane dragged me back.

955
00:59:21,935 --> 00:59:24,096
She wanted to see
the State Legislature in action.

956
00:59:24,171 --> 00:59:26,731
I didn't know
you were interested in politics.

957
00:59:26,807 --> 00:59:29,537
I wasn't until politics
became interested in me.

958
00:59:29,609 --> 00:59:32,601
The Legislature's really
interesting to watch.

959
00:59:33,046 --> 00:59:36,482
Of course, we officers of the law
ain't as forgetful of our promises

960
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:38,177
as the fellows who make the laws.

961
00:59:38,251 --> 00:59:40,879
Now, me, I don't never forget anything.

962
00:59:41,054 --> 00:59:45,423
You know, Sheriff, we had an elephant
in our carnival with a memory like that.

963
00:59:45,492 --> 00:59:49,553
He went after a keeper that he'd held
a grudge against for almost 15 years.

964
00:59:49,629 --> 00:59:51,153
Had to be shot.

965
00:59:51,832 --> 00:59:56,132
You just wouldn't believe how much
trouble it is to dispose of a dead elephant.

966
00:59:56,203 --> 00:59:58,137
If I could be with you

967
00:59:58,538 --> 01:00:00,403
I'd love you strong

968
01:00:00,474 --> 01:00:05,138
If I could be with you I'd love you long

969
01:00:05,312 --> 01:00:07,542
I want you to know...

970
01:00:07,614 --> 01:00:09,605
Excuse me a minute, Dan.

971
01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:13,684
Until I told you, honey, why I love you so

972
01:00:25,565 --> 01:00:27,829
I'd be anything but blue

973
01:00:27,934 --> 01:00:30,926
If I could be with you

974
01:00:36,977 --> 01:00:38,706
Hello, remember me?

975
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:43,445
I'm the fellow that chases girls
off carnival lots.

976
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:45,110
Hello, Field.

977
01:00:45,185 --> 01:00:47,847
You've come a long way
from the Eagle Cafe.

978
01:00:47,921 --> 01:00:49,718
It's still a dining room.

979
01:00:49,789 --> 01:00:51,518
No wonder I couldn't find you.

980
01:00:51,591 --> 01:00:53,991
When you aim, you really aim high.

981
01:00:54,394 --> 01:00:56,862
I suppose you've been
in New York, too, huh?

982
01:00:56,930 --> 01:01:00,093
I've been in a lot of places
since I saw you last.

983
01:01:00,901 --> 01:01:03,734
Isn't it about time he asked you to marry?

984
01:01:04,404 --> 01:01:07,464
- Did you?
- That was different.

985
01:01:07,541 --> 01:01:09,270
Yes, it was, Field.

986
01:01:09,609 --> 01:01:11,509
I was in love with you.

987
01:01:14,748 --> 01:01:18,184
You're a thief, Reynolds.
My company went bankrupt today.

988
01:01:18,251 --> 01:01:19,843
You're drunk, Martin. Go away.

989
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:23,879
- I'm sorry to hear about your company.
Sure, you're sorry! You're rotten.

990
01:01:23,957 --> 01:01:25,822
The whole gang of you are rotten.

991
01:01:25,892 --> 01:01:27,325
Come along...
- Now, just a minute!

992
01:01:27,394 --> 01:01:29,794
I got a right to tell him what I think of him.

993
01:01:29,863 --> 01:01:32,058
It was my company, wasn't it?

994
01:01:32,699 --> 01:01:34,098
Didn't that bother you?

995
01:01:34,167 --> 01:01:36,635
You get used to it.
Someone's always crying.

996
01:01:36,703 --> 01:01:38,034
If he was in and I was out,

997
01:01:38,104 --> 01:01:39,799
then my nose would be pressed
against the windowpane

998
01:01:39,873 --> 01:01:42,774
and he'd call someone
to pull down the shade.

999
01:01:50,050 --> 01:01:51,950
I think it's disgraceful
of that Dan Reynolds

1000
01:01:52,018 --> 01:01:53,815
to flaunt a woman of that sort here.

1001
01:01:53,887 --> 01:01:56,879
Look at her,
sitting there as if she owned the place.

1002
01:01:56,957 --> 01:01:58,686
Well, she practically does.

1003
01:01:58,758 --> 01:02:02,922
Dan just told me they got married
in New York more than a month ago.

1004
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:04,624
Oh!

1005
01:02:04,698 --> 01:02:06,529
Really? How exciting!

1006
01:02:07,033 --> 01:02:09,763
I must call on her
the first thing in the morning.

1007
01:02:09,836 --> 01:02:11,030
Great.

1008
01:02:26,252 --> 01:02:27,344
Lane!

1009
01:02:28,488 --> 01:02:29,614
Lane!

1010
01:02:29,789 --> 01:02:31,723
- Hello, Sarah.
Hello.

1011
01:02:31,791 --> 01:02:34,726
Well, I see Mrs. Reynolds is
rearranging the furniture again.

1012
01:02:34,794 --> 01:02:37,092
We've been grunting and pushing
all morning.

1013
01:02:37,163 --> 01:02:39,791
We get everything real nice
time and time again,

1014
01:02:39,866 --> 01:02:43,393
but it seems like Miss Lane
just can't get comfortable in her mind.

1015
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:44,494
Where is she, Sarah?

1016
01:02:44,571 --> 01:02:48,632
I believe she's still down in the cellar
messing with those contraptions.

1017
01:02:48,708 --> 01:02:50,471
- What contraptions?
- I don't know nothing about them.

1018
01:02:50,543 --> 01:02:53,103
I've got enough to wear me out
in the kitchen with an electric stove

1019
01:02:53,179 --> 01:02:55,670
that you got to run
with buttons and clocks.

1020
01:02:56,016 --> 01:02:57,506
Lane! Lane!

1021
01:02:57,584 --> 01:02:59,484
I'm down here, darling.

1022
01:03:01,354 --> 01:03:04,084
You weren't supposed to get back
until late tonight.

1023
01:03:04,157 --> 01:03:07,354
I didn't want you to see it
till it was all finished.

1024
01:03:09,996 --> 01:03:11,224
But how did you know I wanted a shop?

1025
01:03:11,297 --> 01:03:14,323
Oh, honey, after all the times
you told me that pathetic story

1026
01:03:14,401 --> 01:03:16,926
about having a workshop in your barn
when you were a kid,

1027
01:03:17,003 --> 01:03:20,063
your father not being able to afford even
a hammer after the barn burned down.

1028
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:21,505
It's wonderful.

1029
01:03:21,574 --> 01:03:23,633
Well, if there is anything
that doesn't work, you can blame me.

1030
01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:27,146
Of course, I don't know one of these things
from another except that's a saw.

1031
01:03:27,213 --> 01:03:29,204
I knew that because
I was sawed in half a couple of nights

1032
01:03:29,282 --> 01:03:32,115
when a magician's assistant
got pneumonia.

1033
01:03:34,054 --> 01:03:36,181
I hope you'll be happy with it, Dan.

1034
01:03:36,256 --> 01:03:37,314
As happy as I am.

1035
01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:39,824
- What?
- I said I hope you like it!

1036
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:41,888
Like it?

1037
01:03:42,429 --> 01:03:46,422
Honey, getting you and this house
are the best things I ever did.

1038
01:03:47,667 --> 01:03:51,228
Dan Reynolds, one of these days
you're gonna make me cry.

1039
01:03:51,971 --> 01:03:54,201
Tea is served, Mrs. Reynolds.

1040
01:03:54,441 --> 01:03:56,966
Oh, no, Sarah.
Not down here, please.

1041
01:03:57,043 --> 01:03:59,876
But you said, "Serve the tea at 4:00."

1042
01:03:59,946 --> 01:04:01,538
It's 4:00.

1043
01:04:09,422 --> 01:04:11,083
Strong enough?
- Mmm-hmm.

1044
01:04:11,157 --> 01:04:13,148
- Lemon or cream?
- Straight.

1045
01:04:13,226 --> 01:04:15,353
If I actually thought
you were gonna make me drink this stuff,

1046
01:04:15,428 --> 01:04:16,986
I'd have never bought that tea service.

1047
01:04:17,063 --> 01:04:20,499
I promise never to embarrass you
by bringing it out in company.

1048
01:04:20,567 --> 01:04:21,932
Hello, Titus.

1049
01:04:22,001 --> 01:04:24,094
Hello, Dan. Afternoon, Miss Bellamy.

1050
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:26,730
Mrs. Reynolds.
- Oh, Mrs. Reynolds now, ain't it?

1051
01:04:26,806 --> 01:04:28,831
I always keep forgetting.

1052
01:04:28,908 --> 01:04:32,366
You know, I thought I'd give you time
to get settled before I paid my respects.

1053
01:04:32,445 --> 01:04:36,313
I sure was surprised when
you bought a place in Flamingo Road.

1054
01:04:36,382 --> 01:04:38,145
We always do the unexpected, Titus.

1055
01:04:38,218 --> 01:04:40,652
- As witness, my afternoon tea.
- Tea?

1056
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:43,848
Sit down, Titus. I know what you want.
Here, dear.

1057
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:51,360
Real nice place you got here.
Quite an ambitious undertaking.

1058
01:04:51,431 --> 01:04:53,365
Better than Lute Mae's.

1059
01:04:53,433 --> 01:04:56,493
I admire ambition
when it don't get in my way.

1060
01:04:56,569 --> 01:05:01,302
I've never been able to make up my mind
if you're awful smart or awful stupid.

1061
01:05:01,608 --> 01:05:03,599
Someday you may find out, Sheriff.

1062
01:05:03,676 --> 01:05:05,667
Here's your drink, Titus.

1063
01:05:06,112 --> 01:05:07,443
Excuse me.

1064
01:05:10,917 --> 01:05:11,975
Here.

1065
01:05:13,319 --> 01:05:14,911
Come on, Titus. Out with it.

1066
01:05:14,988 --> 01:05:16,956
- What's on your mind?
- Nothing.

1067
01:05:17,023 --> 01:05:20,584
Except I'd sort of like to see young Field
get along a little faster.

1068
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:24,118
You see, I've been busy measuring
the Governor's chair for him.

1069
01:05:24,197 --> 01:05:28,190
Your memory is getting bad.
The name's Parkhurst, George Parkhurst.

1070
01:05:28,268 --> 01:05:31,101
The chair already fits.
I measured him for it myself.

1071
01:05:31,171 --> 01:05:35,130
Maybe you pronounce it Parkhurst, Dan,
but it's spelt Carlisle.

1072
01:05:35,208 --> 01:05:38,302
I have nothing against Carlisle.
He's just not ready.

1073
01:05:38,378 --> 01:05:40,175
Maybe not, but I am.

1074
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:43,178
You know the Governor's job
was promised to George Parkhurst.

1075
01:05:43,249 --> 01:05:45,274
Yeah, but it can be un-promised.

1076
01:05:45,351 --> 01:05:49,287
I kind of like it for Field.
I like to see young fellows get ahead.

1077
01:05:49,355 --> 01:05:54,520
You know how I've always been,
just an easygoing, friendly, fat old man.

1078
01:05:54,828 --> 01:05:55,852
Mmm-mmm.

1079
01:05:55,929 --> 01:05:58,796
The governorship was promised
to Parkhurst, and it stands.

1080
01:05:58,865 --> 01:06:00,662
I'm going to keep my word.

1081
01:06:00,733 --> 01:06:02,200
So am I, Dan.

1082
01:06:03,069 --> 01:06:06,436
I'm not gonna let you get away with it.
Maybe I shouldn't be so stubborn.

1083
01:06:06,506 --> 01:06:08,565
Maybe I shouldn't care
if you take over the state.

1084
01:06:08,641 --> 01:06:10,370
I can profit by it.

1085
01:06:10,443 --> 01:06:12,934
But Titus, I know
what you've got in your mind.

1086
01:06:13,012 --> 01:06:16,948
Pretty nice state to hand over to you.
Give you five years and you'll drain it dry.

1087
01:06:17,016 --> 01:06:19,211
What isn't corrupted, you'll corrupt.
I've seen it.

1088
01:06:19,285 --> 01:06:21,515
I know what you're capable of.

1089
01:06:22,488 --> 01:06:26,891
You know, Dan, once before I said
we could run this state real good together.

1090
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:28,621
Now, I ain't sure.

1091
01:06:28,695 --> 01:06:31,687
I would hate to have to fight it out
with you.

1092
01:06:35,435 --> 01:06:36,732
Sarah!

1093
01:06:36,803 --> 01:06:38,600
Coming, Mr. Reynolds!

1094
01:06:52,752 --> 01:06:55,812
Lane, what's the trouble
between you and Titus?

1095
01:06:56,623 --> 01:06:59,183
I just don't trust him, that's all.

1096
01:06:59,259 --> 01:07:02,524
That's a lot of hatred
for just not trusting a man.

1097
01:07:02,762 --> 01:07:04,923
Never mind.
You'll tell me when you're ready.

1098
01:07:04,998 --> 01:07:06,488
Come on, honey.

1099
01:07:08,635 --> 01:07:10,262
What did he want?

1100
01:07:10,470 --> 01:07:11,732
A favor.

1101
01:07:12,071 --> 01:07:13,732
I turned him down.

1102
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:17,368
Sometimes I wonder
why I don't let him have his way.

1103
01:07:17,443 --> 01:07:19,343
I have everything I want now.

1104
01:07:19,412 --> 01:07:21,277
I wish you meant that.

1105
01:07:21,648 --> 01:07:25,846
I wish we could get out and leave all this
backstabbing and crookedness behind us.

1106
01:07:25,919 --> 01:07:28,444
- And just turn everything over to Titus?
- No, no, I didn't mean that.

1107
01:07:28,521 --> 01:07:29,988
Well, you give me an answer.

1108
01:07:30,056 --> 01:07:33,753
Look, you know so much more than...
Why don't you be honest with the people?

1109
01:07:33,826 --> 01:07:36,624
Why don't you teach them
to run their own state?

1110
01:07:36,696 --> 01:07:38,323
Honey, the honest men get eaten up.

1111
01:07:38,398 --> 01:07:41,595
There are too many other men waiting,
watching, probing for the soft spots,

1112
01:07:41,668 --> 01:07:43,033
the graft.

1113
01:07:43,102 --> 01:07:47,732
No, it's better to be one of them.
Besides, I've got to keep my eye on Titus.

1114
01:07:47,807 --> 01:07:51,140
Left alone, he'd steal the gold
off the capitol dome.

1115
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:53,678
- You wouldn't like that, would you?
- No.

1116
01:07:53,746 --> 01:07:55,771
That's why you get drunk
on election night.

1117
01:07:57,283 --> 01:07:59,308
You're a very smart girl.

1118
01:08:01,187 --> 01:08:04,782
You take care of the teapot.
Let me take care of Titus.

1119
01:08:06,993 --> 01:08:09,052
It's not that simple, Dan.

1120
01:08:22,608 --> 01:08:24,337
Take the old labor gang
and move that stuff.

1121
01:08:24,410 --> 01:08:26,241
You can take your crane and gang
and give them a hand.

1122
01:08:26,312 --> 01:08:28,473
Hi, Lassen.
- Hi, Sheriff.

1123
01:08:28,548 --> 01:08:30,778
- I want to talk to you.
- What about?

1124
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:34,411
Come on, bub.
I'm gonna give you a lesson in politics.

1125
01:08:34,487 --> 01:08:37,047
I've got some kind of bad news
about that boy of yours.

1126
01:08:37,123 --> 01:08:39,853
Huh?
- Police picked him up in Boldon last night.

1127
01:08:39,926 --> 01:08:41,223
What for?

1128
01:08:41,294 --> 01:08:44,786
Booked him on a hit and run.
There was also a drunk-driving charge.

1129
01:08:44,864 --> 01:08:47,094
Tommy never had a drink in his whole life.

1130
01:08:47,166 --> 01:08:49,134
Saw it right there on the police blotter.

1131
01:08:49,202 --> 01:08:51,796
It's just his word
against a lot of witnesses.

1132
01:08:51,871 --> 01:08:56,240
I sure wouldn't like to take a chance on a
boy of mine going up on a charge like that.

1133
01:08:56,309 --> 01:08:59,005
What is it you want, Sheriff?
You didn't come here just to talk.

1134
01:08:59,078 --> 01:09:00,568
That's right.

1135
01:09:00,646 --> 01:09:01,908
You're gonna do something for me

1136
01:09:01,981 --> 01:09:05,473
and after that I'm going to see
that your boy gets off.

1137
01:09:06,586 --> 01:09:08,110
What is it?

1138
01:09:08,187 --> 01:09:11,554
Well, you know Dan Reynolds is
chairman of the prison board.

1139
01:09:11,624 --> 01:09:15,355
So I'm going to send you some convict
boys and a man with a gun to watch them.

1140
01:09:15,428 --> 01:09:17,919
You're gonna put them to work
without wages.

1141
01:09:17,997 --> 01:09:21,433
I won't do it. I wouldn't do anything
to hurt Dan Reynolds.

1142
01:09:22,502 --> 01:09:26,302
You and me are going to send
Dan Reynolds to jail for peonage.

1143
01:09:26,372 --> 01:09:27,430
I won't do it.

1144
01:09:27,507 --> 01:09:31,307
You'll do it, Burr, just like I'm telling you.
If you don't...

1145
01:09:32,011 --> 01:09:33,478
Come on, bub.

1146
01:09:39,919 --> 01:09:42,547
I'm not gonna go along with you
on a frame-up like that.

1147
01:09:42,622 --> 01:09:47,286
Yes, you will, bub. You'll go along
and you'll do everything just like I say.

1148
01:09:47,727 --> 01:09:52,528
You're getting soft and weak.
You're just the kind of man I like.

1149
01:09:52,598 --> 01:09:55,226
You've got that anxious,
hungry look I like to see.

1150
01:09:55,301 --> 01:09:57,531
That means you want the things
I can give you.

1151
01:09:57,603 --> 01:10:00,367
You'd rather be Governor
than anything else in the world.

1152
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:03,603
Without me, you wouldn't be
even a deputy sheriff.

1153
01:10:05,745 --> 01:10:08,646
You'll go along, bub. You'll go along.

1154
01:10:11,684 --> 01:10:13,777
How are you, Miss Annabelle?

1155
01:10:15,088 --> 01:10:16,817
Sheriff Semple!

1156
01:10:18,858 --> 01:10:20,018
Sheriff Semple!

1157
01:10:20,093 --> 01:10:23,654
Afternoon, Miss Annabelle.
Ain't seen much of you lately.

1158
01:10:23,996 --> 01:10:26,658
You look kind of peaked. You been crying?

1159
01:10:26,732 --> 01:10:30,190
- Have you seen Field?
- Oh, some four to five days ago.

1160
01:10:31,204 --> 01:10:33,604
Papa invited some upstate bankers
for lunch to meet him.

1161
01:10:33,673 --> 01:10:35,231
And they're still at the house waiting.

1162
01:10:35,308 --> 01:10:38,334
Papa's furious!
He says he's given Field his last chance.

1163
01:10:38,411 --> 01:10:42,677
Yeah, I heard you two weren't getting
along so well, quarreling in public and all.

1164
01:10:42,748 --> 01:10:44,545
It's been worse in the last week or so.

1165
01:10:44,617 --> 01:10:47,643
Some nights he doesn't even come home
at all and when he is there,

1166
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:52,453
he talks so crazy, about being able to tell
a governor by his anxious, hungry look.

1167
01:10:52,525 --> 01:10:54,720
I just don't know what to do!

1168
01:10:55,528 --> 01:10:58,053
You just go on home, Miss Annabelle.

1169
01:10:59,031 --> 01:11:01,363
Just leave it to me.

1170
01:11:38,938 --> 01:11:41,338
Trying to crawl into a whiskey bottle?

1171
01:11:41,407 --> 01:11:44,535
You're drinking in kind of bad company,
ain't you, bub?

1172
01:11:44,610 --> 01:11:48,478
Look, bub.
I got you this job to help you financially.

1173
01:11:48,548 --> 01:11:52,917
That name on the door is in water color.
I could spit on it and wash it out.

1174
01:11:52,985 --> 01:11:56,443
You've turned soft in my fingers.
I made a mistake about you.

1175
01:11:56,522 --> 01:11:59,184
The only way we can tell
what a mule or a man can do

1176
01:11:59,258 --> 01:12:01,886
is to give him a field to plough.

1177
01:12:01,961 --> 01:12:03,792
The job I have got to do is too big.

1178
01:12:03,863 --> 01:12:07,264
- You're gonna throw me over, huh?
- I'm just turning you loose.

1179
01:12:07,333 --> 01:12:09,096
Well, you can't do that!

1180
01:12:09,168 --> 01:12:13,400
I don't like for people to talk to me
like the way you're doing, bub.

1181
01:12:15,241 --> 01:12:17,835
You're not gonna throw me out
like you did the rest of them!

1182
01:12:17,910 --> 01:12:21,573
Look, I told you, I don't like to hear
you say such things.

1183
01:12:26,252 --> 01:12:29,779
You ain't even gutsy enough
to fight an old man like me.

1184
01:12:34,293 --> 01:12:35,521
Get out!

1185
01:12:37,597 --> 01:12:38,859
Get out!

1186
01:12:47,006 --> 01:12:49,702
I told you it wasn't permanent, bub!

1187
01:13:02,288 --> 01:13:06,247
- What do you think is really happening?
- I'm not sure, but I don't like the feel of it.

1188
01:13:06,325 --> 01:13:10,318
That's the reason why I called you all here,
to see if we could figure it out together.

1189
01:13:10,396 --> 01:13:14,059
I've been sort of bird-dogging Titus
these past few days.

1190
01:13:14,133 --> 01:13:16,829
I found him in some very strange cover.

1191
01:13:17,503 --> 01:13:19,471
He's looking for trouble
and he's got a nose for it.

1192
01:13:27,146 --> 01:13:30,309
Good evening, Sheriff.
Good evening, Sarah.

1193
01:13:32,285 --> 01:13:35,777
Don't bother to tell him I'm here.
I'll go right on in.

1194
01:13:39,058 --> 01:13:42,084
- Well, how are you, boys?
Hello, Sheriff.

1195
01:13:42,161 --> 01:13:43,958
I'm sure I never figured
to find you all here.

1196
01:13:44,030 --> 01:13:47,090
How are you, Niles? John, Ed, Leo, Tom.

1197
01:13:47,166 --> 01:13:48,258
Dan.

1198
01:13:49,001 --> 01:13:50,127
Hello, Titus.

1199
01:13:50,202 --> 01:13:52,500
I didn't mean to break in on you like this.

1200
01:13:52,571 --> 01:13:54,801
I didn't really think
there was no truth in it.

1201
01:13:54,874 --> 01:13:57,274
I heard the boys were in town and up here.

1202
01:13:57,343 --> 01:13:59,834
So I says to myself,
"Why, that can't be so. "

1203
01:13:59,912 --> 01:14:02,710
For years they've made it a point of
dropping around to the Palmer House

1204
01:14:02,782 --> 01:14:06,878
to say hello to me. Now, why should
they stop doing that all of a sudden?

1205
01:14:06,952 --> 01:14:10,854
So I just started wanting company and
come up to spend a little time with you.

1206
01:14:10,923 --> 01:14:12,083
We're glad to have you.

1207
01:14:12,158 --> 01:14:13,284
Yes. How've you been, Sheriff?

1208
01:14:13,359 --> 01:14:14,724
I was going to call you
in the morning.

1209
01:14:14,794 --> 01:14:16,989
Something on your mind, Titus?

1210
01:14:17,063 --> 01:14:18,189
Yeah.

1211
01:14:19,098 --> 01:14:22,864
Boys, we ain't gonna run
Parkhurst as Governor.

1212
01:14:22,935 --> 01:14:24,425
- What?
What do you mean?

1213
01:14:24,503 --> 01:14:25,834
Why, you're crazy!

1214
01:14:25,905 --> 01:14:27,930
You know, I let people think that
for a long time.

1215
01:14:28,007 --> 01:14:31,465
I used to like to hear them say,
"That fat, good-natured old Titus. "

1216
01:14:33,112 --> 01:14:37,378
You know, all fat people are
supposed to be laughing and happy.

1217
01:14:37,450 --> 01:14:40,647
I spent most of my life
getting people to think that.

1218
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:43,245
All right, Titus, let's get down to it.

1219
01:14:43,322 --> 01:14:46,519
You still dreaming of running Carlisle
in Parkhurst's place?

1220
01:14:46,592 --> 01:14:47,786
No.

1221
01:14:48,127 --> 01:14:49,924
- Then who is it?
- It's me.

1222
01:14:49,995 --> 01:14:51,792
- You?
- I don't get it.

1223
01:14:51,864 --> 01:14:54,833
You are crazy.
You know you can't get away with it.

1224
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:56,367
I think maybe I can.

1225
01:14:56,435 --> 01:14:58,562
I won't go along with it
and neither will my district!

1226
01:14:58,637 --> 01:15:03,370
Why, John, I figured to have you in jail
by the time the primaries come along.

1227
01:15:03,442 --> 01:15:06,434
I've been doing some rooting around
and you'd be surprised

1228
01:15:06,512 --> 01:15:09,242
the things I ran into right here
in this state.

1229
01:15:09,315 --> 01:15:12,944
There's been some unusual illegal
contracts, phony land condemnations...

1230
01:15:13,018 --> 01:15:14,042
Now see here, Titus, you...

1231
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:17,351
Now, you were in
on that land grab, too, Ed.

1232
01:15:17,423 --> 01:15:20,051
The fact is, all of you seemed
to have got your cut of it.

1233
01:15:20,126 --> 01:15:24,028
Now, here I have something
that will really interest you.

1234
01:15:25,297 --> 01:15:26,787
What's this?

1235
01:15:26,866 --> 01:15:32,099
Go ahead! Read them!
Contracts, checks, bank statements.

1236
01:15:32,171 --> 01:15:34,366
They're photostatic copies
so I've got plenty more!

1237
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:35,737
What's the idea of this?

1238
01:15:35,808 --> 01:15:37,469
Why, you double-crossing...

1239
01:15:37,543 --> 01:15:40,068
Now, there ain't no use to calling names.

1240
01:15:40,146 --> 01:15:43,115
You see, the public are used to
having you all eat at the trough.

1241
01:15:43,182 --> 01:15:47,482
I don't know how they'll take it when
they learn you ate up the trough, too.

1242
01:15:47,553 --> 01:15:48,986
Nothing for me, Titus?

1243
01:15:49,054 --> 01:15:52,683
Oh, I have a few jim-dandies for you
if you really want them!

1244
01:15:52,758 --> 01:15:56,353
Now, look here, Titus.
If we go to jail, you go with us.

1245
01:15:57,963 --> 01:15:59,897
Now, that's a funny thing.

1246
01:15:59,965 --> 01:16:03,457
But somehow, there ain't a scrap of paper
to tie me to you.

1247
01:16:03,536 --> 01:16:05,561
All of you were so busy
getting your big cuts

1248
01:16:05,638 --> 01:16:07,833
that you were careless
when you gave me my little ones.

1249
01:16:07,907 --> 01:16:12,344
I plucked a goose here and there
but nobody could find the feathers.

1250
01:16:13,345 --> 01:16:15,643
You know, I almost believe you.

1251
01:16:16,449 --> 01:16:20,351
I hope you do, Dan.
I sure wouldn't want to see you go to jail.

1252
01:16:20,653 --> 01:16:24,487
Dan, we've got to be reasonable.
- I can't afford to take any chances.

1253
01:16:24,557 --> 01:16:26,218
Maybe we ought to
think about this some.

1254
01:16:26,292 --> 01:16:28,522
There's nothing to think about.

1255
01:16:28,961 --> 01:16:33,261
Titus, if you try this,
I'll fight you every inch of the way.

1256
01:16:33,332 --> 01:16:35,664
Sure sorry to hear you say that, Dan.

1257
01:16:35,734 --> 01:16:40,068
You'll find out sooner than you think
that it don't pay to be too stubborn.

1258
01:16:41,207 --> 01:16:43,368
Well, I've got to be going.

1259
01:16:44,310 --> 01:16:46,574
Any of you boys coming my way?

1260
01:16:47,213 --> 01:16:49,147
Can't go along with you, Dan.

1261
01:16:49,215 --> 01:16:50,648
Maybe we could make some kind of a deal.

1262
01:16:50,716 --> 01:16:52,775
Don't you think we ought to
sleep on it? Maybe in the morning.

1263
01:16:52,852 --> 01:16:54,046
No.

1264
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:56,244
You boys go on.

1265
01:16:57,823 --> 01:16:59,723
No hard feelings, Dan?

1266
01:17:00,793 --> 01:17:02,055
No hard feelings.

1267
01:17:02,127 --> 01:17:03,560
Can I drop you, Titus? I got my car.

1268
01:17:03,629 --> 01:17:04,926
Maybe we ought to stop off
and have a drink.

1269
01:17:04,997 --> 01:17:06,692
Sorry, Dan.
Good night, Dan!

1270
01:17:06,765 --> 01:17:09,427
Maybe get a glass of milk,
if you like.

1271
01:17:55,948 --> 01:18:00,442
I'm sorry, Lane. Thought you were asleep.
I didn't feel much like talking.

1272
01:18:01,353 --> 01:18:03,014
You don't have to.

1273
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:06,858
I heard the whole thing.

1274
01:18:07,826 --> 01:18:11,318
No matter what you give Titus Semple,
he'll never let up.

1275
01:18:11,397 --> 01:18:14,924
He hates you worse
than any of the others because of me.

1276
01:18:16,168 --> 01:18:17,226
Why?

1277
01:18:18,304 --> 01:18:20,499
He's been after me
ever since I came to Boldon.

1278
01:18:20,573 --> 01:18:24,976
He was determined to break me and
make me run away, only I wouldn't run.

1279
01:18:25,411 --> 01:18:27,311
- So he framed me.
- Why?

1280
01:18:29,648 --> 01:18:32,583
To protect his candidate's political future.

1281
01:18:33,352 --> 01:18:37,789
He thought Field Carlisle was in love
with me and I was in love with him.

1282
01:18:38,223 --> 01:18:39,485
Were you?

1283
01:18:42,328 --> 01:18:43,386
Yes.

1284
01:18:43,729 --> 01:18:45,788
Are you in love with him now?

1285
01:18:45,864 --> 01:18:48,526
Were you in love with him
when you married me?

1286
01:18:48,601 --> 01:18:50,068
I don't know.

1287
01:18:50,736 --> 01:18:54,900
You at least knew you weren't in love
with me. You were that honest.

1288
01:18:55,474 --> 01:18:58,272
You thought if you married me,
you'd be out of Titus's reach.

1289
01:18:58,344 --> 01:19:01,643
You thought I had more power
than he had and you'd be secure,

1290
01:19:01,714 --> 01:19:04,239
maybe one day you'd pay him back.

1291
01:19:04,316 --> 01:19:06,079
And then you and Carlisle would...

1292
01:19:06,151 --> 01:19:07,743
That's not true!

1293
01:19:08,554 --> 01:19:11,751
No one has ever played me
for quite such a sucker.

1294
01:19:13,325 --> 01:19:17,728
I don't mind being taken for a free ride,
but if you had just warned me,

1295
01:19:17,896 --> 01:19:19,591
if you'd just told me these things
when I asked you to,

1296
01:19:19,665 --> 01:19:21,895
I'd have known what to expect.

1297
01:19:23,469 --> 01:19:25,869
I've made two big mistakes in my life.

1298
01:19:25,938 --> 01:19:28,930
I underestimated Titus
and I overestimated you.

1299
01:19:29,008 --> 01:19:32,774
- But you...
- Too bad, sugar. This joke's on you.

1300
01:19:32,845 --> 01:19:34,642
Titus is top man now.

1301
01:19:39,351 --> 01:19:40,409
Dan.

1302
01:19:43,122 --> 01:19:44,180
Dan.

1303
01:19:57,369 --> 01:20:01,772
I'm here at the station.
I'm catching the 1:15 for Olympic City.

1304
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,831
I'll probably be moving fast
in the next couple of weeks

1305
01:20:03,909 --> 01:20:06,002
so I can't tell you where I'll be.

1306
01:20:06,078 --> 01:20:09,013
Will you have Sarah pack a bag for me
and send it on to the Olympic City Hotel?

1307
01:20:10,549 --> 01:20:13,211
All right, Jamieson!
Train's just about to pull out.

1308
01:20:13,285 --> 01:20:14,650
Dan.
- Yes?

1309
01:20:16,021 --> 01:20:17,045
Will you call me?

1310
01:20:17,690 --> 01:20:19,817
There isn't anything to say.

1311
01:20:29,601 --> 01:20:31,933
- Hello, Doc.
- You got a story for me, Dan?

1312
01:20:32,004 --> 01:20:33,972
I understand
Titus has you all over a barrel.

1313
01:20:34,039 --> 01:20:35,529
He's gonna put himself in as Governor.

1314
01:20:35,607 --> 01:20:38,474
My client has
no statement to make, Waterson.

1315
01:20:38,544 --> 01:20:40,774
I don't need any
legal protection against Doc.

1316
01:20:40,846 --> 01:20:42,143
Don't miss the train.

1317
01:20:42,214 --> 01:20:43,272
Okay.

1318
01:20:43,348 --> 01:20:45,816
- What are you going to do, Dan?
- I don't know.

1319
01:20:45,884 --> 01:20:47,181
I'm no lace-pants reformer,

1320
01:20:47,252 --> 01:20:50,688
but I'll be horsewhipped
before I'll turn this state over to Titus.

1321
01:20:50,756 --> 01:20:53,691
I don't know yet how we could have
been so stupid as to let this happen.

1322
01:20:53,759 --> 01:20:55,556
Men like Titus don't just happen.

1323
01:20:55,627 --> 01:20:57,561
No, it's men like me
that make them possible.

1324
01:20:58,931 --> 01:21:02,128
Say, Doc, you're always writing fancy,
flag-waving speeches

1325
01:21:02,201 --> 01:21:04,032
telling how to run the universe.

1326
01:21:04,103 --> 01:21:06,697
- Have you a solution?
- Not off-hand.

1327
01:21:06,772 --> 01:21:08,763
But then I don't think our form
of government's so bad

1328
01:21:08,841 --> 01:21:10,240
that honest men can't run it.

1329
01:21:10,309 --> 01:21:11,833
Aboard!

1330
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:13,878
- Good luck.
- Thanks, Doc.

1331
01:21:45,144 --> 01:21:46,475
Who is it?

1332
01:21:55,621 --> 01:21:56,781
Field!

1333
01:21:57,623 --> 01:22:00,683
- I got to talk to you.
- Well, you can't. It's late.

1334
01:22:00,759 --> 01:22:02,192
You're drunk!

1335
01:22:02,995 --> 01:22:04,656
Not drunk enough.

1336
01:22:05,030 --> 01:22:07,931
There's not enough liquor in the world
to wash away what I got to wash away.

1337
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,900
You have no business to come here
at this time of night.

1338
01:22:09,968 --> 01:22:13,062
There's nobody here.
I watched them all leave, one by one.

1339
01:22:13,138 --> 01:22:16,596
Sitting across the street for hours
in my car.

1340
01:22:18,210 --> 01:22:20,110
Guess I went to sleep!

1341
01:22:20,779 --> 01:22:22,940
It's as good a place as any.

1342
01:22:30,622 --> 01:22:33,523
Why don't you stop killing yourself
this way?

1343
01:22:33,892 --> 01:22:38,386
If it were just that simple.
I've been trying all day to get up the nerve.

1344
01:22:45,270 --> 01:22:46,965
Field, what's wrong?
What's happened to you?

1345
01:22:47,039 --> 01:22:49,974
I crawled into a bottle and I can't get out,

1346
01:22:50,409 --> 01:22:54,345
my sweet little wife's thrown me over,
Titus is through with me...

1347
01:22:54,413 --> 01:22:55,778
I lost you.

1348
01:22:57,516 --> 01:22:59,040
You are drunk.

1349
01:23:00,085 --> 01:23:01,848
It's the only way I could
get up the courage to come here

1350
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:04,753
to say what's been eating me
all these months.

1351
01:23:04,823 --> 01:23:08,088
We should have stayed together.
I'd have been all right then.

1352
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:12,426
None of this would have happened.
I'd have made a good deputy sheriff.

1353
01:23:13,432 --> 01:23:17,869
It never would have worked.
Whatever we had is over.

1354
01:23:17,936 --> 01:23:21,269
I can look at you now
and know it's completely gone.

1355
01:23:21,907 --> 01:23:24,102
Now, come on, you can't stay here.
You better go home.

1356
01:23:24,176 --> 01:23:26,007
Go back to my gutter?

1357
01:23:27,179 --> 01:23:31,513
I got a nice little place all staked out
in front of the Palmer House.

1358
01:23:31,583 --> 01:23:35,349
Titus can rock and rock and rock
and look down on me and spit.

1359
01:23:35,420 --> 01:23:36,978
Oh, he's got all of us.

1360
01:23:37,055 --> 01:23:40,513
He framed you and now he's framed Dan.
He's got us all.

1361
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:45,327
- What do you mean, he's framed Dan?
- I want a drink.

1362
01:23:45,397 --> 01:23:46,830
How did Titus frame Dan?

1363
01:23:46,899 --> 01:23:50,232
What difference does it make?
He's got us all licked.

1364
01:23:50,736 --> 01:23:53,671
I'm sick, Lane.
I'm sick all the way through.

1365
01:23:54,172 --> 01:23:58,108
- I need a drink. Please give me a drink.
- All right, all right.

1366
01:23:59,278 --> 01:24:01,178
Then will you tell me?

1367
01:24:03,382 --> 01:24:05,714
You're really in love with Dan?

1368
01:24:51,330 --> 01:24:52,490
Field!

1369
01:25:01,873 --> 01:25:03,864
Hold it, Sheriff!

1370
01:25:04,109 --> 01:25:07,636
I'm Johnson of The Olympic City Times,
Sheriff. Will you make a statement?

1371
01:25:07,713 --> 01:25:10,477
No boys, there ain't much to say
at a time like this.

1372
01:25:10,549 --> 01:25:13,985
Senator Carlisle was a brilliant man
with a great future.

1373
01:25:14,052 --> 01:25:17,146
But when a man gets into bad company
and starts calling on another man's wife

1374
01:25:17,222 --> 01:25:19,315
late at night
when the husband ain't home...

1375
01:25:19,391 --> 01:25:23,327
- There's no doubt about it being suicide?
- Depends on how you look at it.

1376
01:25:23,395 --> 01:25:25,795
It's his gun, but then maybe
a man could get so tormented

1377
01:25:25,864 --> 01:25:29,391
by that kind of woman,
he wouldn't know what he was doing.

1378
01:25:32,104 --> 01:25:33,867
Back to the office.

1379
01:25:43,949 --> 01:25:45,211
The Grand Jury must be crazy

1380
01:25:45,283 --> 01:25:48,116
if they think they can make
this indictment against me stick!

1381
01:25:48,186 --> 01:25:51,587
I said the same thing to Semple last night
when I first got wind of it.

1382
01:25:51,656 --> 01:25:53,749
But he appears to think they can.

1383
01:25:53,825 --> 01:25:55,656
He'd just come from the showdown
at your house

1384
01:25:55,727 --> 01:25:57,991
and he was cocky as a bantam rooster.

1385
01:25:58,063 --> 01:26:00,156
He's a trifle overweight for a bantam.

1386
01:26:00,232 --> 01:26:02,359
This is no laughing matter, Dan.

1387
01:26:02,434 --> 01:26:05,631
When the Attorney General steps
into a case, it's serious.

1388
01:26:05,704 --> 01:26:07,763
They've got you on a peonage charge,

1389
01:26:07,839 --> 01:26:10,933
working with convict labor,
not paying for it.

1390
01:26:11,009 --> 01:26:13,170
And they've got the sworn statements
of eight convicts

1391
01:26:13,245 --> 01:26:16,180
and your own construction boss,
Burr Lassen.

1392
01:26:16,882 --> 01:26:19,976
Well, if Lassen did it,
Titus must really have him by the throat.

1393
01:26:20,052 --> 01:26:22,043
It's too bad about Burr,
but as your lawyer,

1394
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:23,815
I'm bound to worry about your neck.

1395
01:26:24,990 --> 01:26:26,252
Come in.

1396
01:26:28,293 --> 01:26:30,090
- Mr. Reynolds?
- Here.

1397
01:26:55,620 --> 01:26:56,609
Good evening, Sarah.

1398
01:26:56,688 --> 01:26:58,656
If you want to see Mrs. Reynolds,
you can't see her.

1399
01:26:58,723 --> 01:27:01,624
She don't want to see nobody,
nobody at all.

1400
01:27:01,693 --> 01:27:05,254
Besides, Doc Waterson,
she's asleep, sound asleep.

1401
01:27:05,330 --> 01:27:09,664
- I'll tell her you were here.
- Never mind, Sarah, I'll tell her myself!

1402
01:27:09,968 --> 01:27:11,367
And at a late hour yesterday,

1403
01:27:11,436 --> 01:27:13,461
the Grand Jury indicted Dan Reynolds,

1404
01:27:13,538 --> 01:27:16,769
state political boss,
on a charge of peonage.

1405
01:27:16,842 --> 01:27:19,777
The Attorney General is assuming
personal direction of the case

1406
01:27:19,845 --> 01:27:24,043
and he promises to press the inquiry
to the fullest. He is quoted...

1407
01:27:24,282 --> 01:27:28,378
Now, you don't believe that, do you?
Dan's too smart for any cheap graft.

1408
01:27:28,453 --> 01:27:30,944
No, I know it's a frame-up.
Field told me.

1409
01:27:31,022 --> 01:27:33,616
Did he tell you how Titus framed him?

1410
01:27:33,892 --> 01:27:36,087
That's all I could get out of him.

1411
01:27:36,161 --> 01:27:38,561
I'm not much of a man for giving advice,
Mrs. Reynolds,

1412
01:27:38,630 --> 01:27:41,155
never having been able to take it myself,

1413
01:27:41,233 --> 01:27:43,963
but I'm suggesting
that you get out of town today.

1414
01:27:44,035 --> 01:27:46,697
If you don't, Titus will drive you out.

1415
01:27:46,771 --> 01:27:49,137
How? What are you talking about?

1416
01:27:49,341 --> 01:27:51,935
Well, this morning a committee
made a call on our mayor,

1417
01:27:52,010 --> 01:27:53,443
a committee of women.

1418
01:27:53,512 --> 01:27:54,536
Yes?

1419
01:27:54,613 --> 01:27:57,810
They went there protesting
to the mayor about you.

1420
01:27:58,016 --> 01:27:59,950
But I don't understand.

1421
01:28:00,385 --> 01:28:01,682
Well, it's this way.

1422
01:28:01,753 --> 01:28:04,278
They call themselves
the Mother's Committee.

1423
01:28:04,356 --> 01:28:05,448
Tomorrow, Titus will name it

1424
01:28:05,524 --> 01:28:08,459
a spontaneous demonstration
by indignant citizens.

1425
01:28:12,631 --> 01:28:14,997
I know you're trying to help me.

1426
01:28:16,168 --> 01:28:19,103
- But I'm not running.
- Maybe you'll wish you had.

1427
01:28:19,171 --> 01:28:22,299
Titus is digging up some more
of his particular brand of dirt.

1428
01:28:22,374 --> 01:28:24,535
You'd be surprised how fast it can spread.

1429
01:28:26,244 --> 01:28:28,872
- Get out of town!
- You're a cheat!

1430
01:28:35,220 --> 01:28:36,244
What is this?

1431
01:28:36,321 --> 01:28:38,084
I was hoping you'd get out
before this happened.

1432
01:28:38,156 --> 01:28:41,717
It's gonna get louder, Mrs. Reynolds.
Louder and uglier!

1433
01:28:45,664 --> 01:28:47,188
I'll stop them!

1434
01:28:47,399 --> 01:28:49,162
No, don't! That's just what the mob wants.

1435
01:28:49,234 --> 01:28:52,032
Well, I'll stop them in another way.
I'll have them arrested!

1436
01:28:52,103 --> 01:28:53,832
It won't do any good. No one will come.

1437
01:28:53,905 --> 01:28:57,102
The same man who arranged
that demonstration controls the police.

1438
01:28:57,175 --> 01:29:00,144
If you don't get out town,
we'll run you out!

1439
01:29:01,846 --> 01:29:03,404
Titus Semple!

1440
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:41,913
Yeah, he's still here, honey.
Lute Mae kept him waiting for you.

1441
01:29:41,987 --> 01:29:44,251
You want me with you
or do you want to be alone?

1442
01:29:44,322 --> 01:29:45,482
Alone.

1443
01:29:57,602 --> 01:30:00,230
Miss Bellamy, you keep surprising me.

1444
01:30:00,572 --> 01:30:04,906
Mrs. Reynolds, I mean. I keep forgetting.
I sure figured you'd be gone by now.

1445
01:30:04,976 --> 01:30:07,103
You'd have saved a heap of trouble
if you had.

1446
01:30:07,178 --> 01:30:09,738
Saved who, Sheriff? You or me?

1447
01:30:09,814 --> 01:30:14,478
- I ain't never felt in need of salvation.
- Oh, but you are, Sheriff.

1448
01:30:14,552 --> 01:30:18,010
You've gotten away with the things you've
done because everyone's afraid of you.

1449
01:30:18,089 --> 01:30:20,250
Well, I'm not. Not anymore.

1450
01:30:20,892 --> 01:30:24,726
What you've done to me
and what you did to Field is past.

1451
01:30:24,796 --> 01:30:29,096
That can't be helped. But I'm not going
to let you destroy my husband.

1452
01:30:31,603 --> 01:30:36,302
Miss Bellamy, I'm going to crucify you.
You and Dan both.

1453
01:30:38,977 --> 01:30:42,208
You're going to pick up that phone
and call the Attorney General.

1454
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:45,716
You're going to tell him it was a frame-up
and that Dan is innocent.

1455
01:30:45,784 --> 01:30:48,776
Because if you don't, Sheriff, I'll kill you.

1456
01:30:51,389 --> 01:30:54,552
Looks like I just about got to do
as you suggest.

1457
01:30:59,864 --> 01:31:01,388
Long distance.

1458
01:31:01,499 --> 01:31:04,400
Shame after I had everything
planned so nice.

1459
01:31:04,502 --> 01:31:07,369
Hello? This is Sheriff Semple.

1460
01:31:08,039 --> 01:31:11,736
I want to talk to Attorney General Brandon
in Olympic City.

1461
01:31:12,844 --> 01:31:16,541
I guess now we're gonna break out into
a rash of good government,

1462
01:31:16,614 --> 01:31:18,980
when poor old Titus has retired.

1463
01:31:19,050 --> 01:31:21,712
Dan's heart was never in smart politics.

1464
01:31:21,786 --> 01:31:24,880
He always had a kind of
nasty streak of honesty!

1465
01:31:30,695 --> 01:31:34,825
I should have spit you out
the first time you lit between my teeth.

1466
01:31:35,066 --> 01:31:39,435
It ain't too late now. It's your gun.
It'd be self-defense.

1467
01:32:11,836 --> 01:32:13,326
The position
of the gun indicates

1468
01:32:13,405 --> 01:32:16,135
that it could have fallen
from Semple's hand.

1469
01:32:16,207 --> 01:32:18,300
These are his fingerprints.

1470
01:32:19,043 --> 01:32:21,807
I think that's all the evidence we need.

1471
01:32:22,313 --> 01:32:24,645
Dan, you can see your wife now.

1472
01:32:25,550 --> 01:32:27,575
I'm very grateful. Thanks.

1473
01:32:27,652 --> 01:32:29,017
Take these down for photostats.

1474
01:32:29,087 --> 01:32:32,056
- Right, Will.
- Give me the Women's Division, block C.

1475
01:32:33,992 --> 01:32:35,721
I'm kind of disappointed in you.

1476
01:32:35,794 --> 01:32:37,557
Why didn't you tip me off
this was gonna happen?

1477
01:32:37,629 --> 01:32:39,756
I'd have had an extra on the street.

1478
01:32:39,831 --> 01:32:42,299
I haven't been very cooperative, have I?

1479
01:32:42,367 --> 01:32:44,028
Some people think you have.

1480
01:32:44,102 --> 01:32:46,468
Half the county will be out
to shake your hand.

1481
01:32:46,538 --> 01:32:49,166
I didn't mean it to turn out like this.

1482
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:50,969
I've hurt Dan, too.

1483
01:32:51,543 --> 01:32:55,809
The one man who could have cleared him
before the Grand Jury is dead.

1484
01:33:05,356 --> 01:33:06,414
Dan.

1485
01:33:08,593 --> 01:33:11,323
Dan, I thought I'd never see you again.

1486
01:33:12,297 --> 01:33:16,427
When you walked out,
I knew then how much you meant to me.

1487
01:33:19,137 --> 01:33:22,504
