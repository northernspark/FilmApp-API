2
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,420
Klytus, I'm bored.

3
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,500
What plaything
can you offer me today?

4
00:00:47,864 --> 00:00:56,224
An obscure body in the SK system.
The inhabitants call it Earth.

5
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:01,259
How peaceful it looks.

6
00:01:05,907 --> 00:01:09,747
EARTHQUAKE

7
00:01:11,074 --> 00:01:16,994
Most effective, Your Majesty.
Will you destroy this Earth?

8
00:01:17,492 --> 00:01:24,931
Later. I like to play with things...
before annihilation.

MAIN TITLE

10
00:03:55,252 --> 00:03:58,852
HOT HAIL

11
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:53,070
Green Mountain Airways 123
requesting instructions.

12
00:05:53,471 --> 00:06:00,031
I hope Flash Gordon's had
a great vacation after last season.

13
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:14,524
- Any problem, fellas?
- Just turbulence. Nothing serious.

14
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,689
Nothing you'd want to toss
a third-down pass through either.

15
00:06:19,096 --> 00:06:24,856
Would you like to autograph this
for my kid, Mr. Gordon?

16
00:06:26,847 --> 00:06:30,887
- Call Boston approach.
- It may be smoother higher up.

17
00:06:31,306 --> 00:06:35,866
Do us a favor and leave them alone.
They're busy driving the bus.

18
00:06:36,307 --> 00:06:40,027
It's just a little turbulence.

19
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:44,192
- My name's Flash.
- I know.

20
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:48,439
I'm sorry if I seemed rude.
I'm just a little scared.

21
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:53,048
It's kind of nice.
A travel agent who's scared in planes.

22
00:06:53,474 --> 00:06:58,154
I asked the Maître D' who you were.

23
00:06:59,891 --> 00:07:04,731
- Talk to me. Get my mind off this.
- I couldn't believe you were alone.

24
00:07:05,184 --> 00:07:07,984
- You're just saying that.
- No, I mean it.

25
00:07:08,351 --> 00:07:13,431
- What were you doing there, alone?
- Trying to get my head together.

26
00:07:13,893 --> 00:07:18,973
- By myself, you know?
- I sure do.

27
00:07:19,436 --> 00:07:22,235
It's okay.
Honestly, it's nothing.

28
00:07:22,602 --> 00:07:25,402
- Famous last words.
- I take flying lessons.

29
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:30,889
Sometimes air rises above clouds
and you get a...

30
00:07:31,353 --> 00:07:35,633
What's the matter?

31
00:07:39,313 --> 00:07:43,593
What's happening, Flash?

32
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:22,277
Dr. Zarkov! There's no sun.
It's 8:24 in the morning.

33
00:08:22,731 --> 00:08:25,851
- No sun?
- No.

34
00:08:26,231 --> 00:08:29,711
Check the angular vector
of the moon.

35
00:08:30,106 --> 00:08:34,946
There seems to be no reason
for these intergalactic upsets.

36
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:40,559
Only Dr. Hans Zarkov, formerly
of NASA, provided an explanation.

37
00:08:41,024 --> 00:08:45,744
His ideas, however,
have been rejected as irrational.

38
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:51,992
According to NASA, today's
solar eclipse is no cause for alarm.

39
00:08:52,484 --> 00:08:59,043
A team of scientists has been
in conference with the President.

40
00:08:59,693 --> 00:09:02,693
What do you find?
The moon out of orbit?

41
00:09:03,068 --> 00:09:07,108
By more than twelve degrees.
It must be a mistake.

42
00:09:07,527 --> 00:09:13,287
That's no mistake.
It's an attack.

43
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:19,590
I've been right all these years.

44
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:33,979
Fragments of moon rock. Our moon
is subjected to some enormous force.

45
00:09:34,487 --> 00:09:40,527
A kind of energy beam.

46
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:44,990
Time to go, Munson.
I've got the coordinates -

47
00:09:45,405 --> 00:09:48,125
- the direction it's coming from.

48
00:09:48,489 --> 00:09:51,409
This is what we've been waiting for.

49
00:09:51,781 --> 00:09:56,181
We'll go up and counter-attack.

50
00:09:56,615 --> 00:10:00,775
You're crazy.
I'm not going up in that.

51
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:05,398
- I can't handle the capsule alone.
- You'd better try.

52
00:10:05,824 --> 00:10:10,664
- Get your toothbrush and whatever.
- Right, chief.

53
00:10:11,116 --> 00:10:17,276
Munson!
Why are you running away?

54
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,255
All the frequencies are dead.

55
00:10:20,615 --> 00:10:26,175
- Get a look at the V.O.R.
- Holy cow!

56
00:10:26,574 --> 00:10:31,134
John, ten o'clock!

57
00:10:34,158 --> 00:10:39,118
I'll put this baby down right here.

58
00:10:45,867 --> 00:10:50,147
What the hell?

59
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:58,364
- My God, where are the pilots?
- Help me pull her up.

60
00:11:06,243 --> 00:11:08,883
Are we coming up?
I can't see.

61
00:11:09,244 --> 00:11:12,004
Me neither. Look for landing lights.

62
00:11:12,369 --> 00:11:17,449
- This isn't my scene. Look where?
- Hit the switches over there.

63
00:11:17,912 --> 00:11:22,272
Did your flying lessons
get as far as landing?

64
00:11:22,704 --> 00:11:26,224
I was afraid you'd ask that. No.

65
00:11:26,621 --> 00:11:31,221
Hang on, here we go.

66
00:11:41,122 --> 00:11:43,442
Munson!

67
00:11:43,789 --> 00:11:47,309
I swear, Munson, I'll shoot!

68
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:50,626
Get shot, go up,
what's the difference?

69
00:11:50,999 --> 00:11:54,159
You'll give your life to save Earth.

70
00:11:54,541 --> 00:12:00,101
- Haven't you any spirit at all?
- No!

71
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:11,454
- Dr. Zarkov, listen!
- You're back.

72
00:12:22,043 --> 00:12:25,843
- Dale, you all right?
- I'm terrific.

73
00:12:26,249 --> 00:12:31,969
Let's get out of here
before she blows.

74
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:47,552
Hold me for a second, then drop me,
I'll kiss the ground.

75
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:53,480
- You sure you're okay?
- Fine. But no more flying.

76
00:12:54,627 --> 00:13:00,067
- Good morning! Are you injured?
- It seems not.

77
00:13:00,545 --> 00:13:04,585
A miracle.
I expect you'd like to use my phone?

78
00:13:05,004 --> 00:13:10,204
- I would.
- I'm sure the insurance...

79
00:13:10,671 --> 00:13:14,750
- Please, don't mention it.
- What happened to the sun?

80
00:13:15,171 --> 00:13:20,251
- Looks like an eclipse.
- There was nothing about it on TV.

81
00:13:20,713 --> 00:13:25,432
The phone is right in there.

82
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:34,810
Sorry, Munson.
Missed your opportunity.

83
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:40,134
- Where's the telephone?
- I'm sure that's Dr. Zarkov.

84
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:43,070
He's a crazy scientist I saw on TV.

85
00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:47,943
He kept talking about an attack.
They kicked him out of NASA...

86
00:13:48,382 --> 00:13:50,822
- Dr. Zarkov.
- Enough!

87
00:13:51,174 --> 00:13:53,934
- Are you crazy?
- Unfortunately not.

88
00:13:54,299 --> 00:14:00,419
The attack has begun. We have eleven
days before the moon crashes down.

89
00:14:00,925 --> 00:14:05,365
- I need aid in taking off.
- Taking off where?

90
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:11,001
Up there. I need one person
to keep a foot on that red pedal -

91
00:14:11,468 --> 00:14:17,108
- During blast-off.
You're the lighter. Sit down.

92
00:14:17,594 --> 00:14:23,313
You may leave. Tell the world
what Hans Zarkov has done.

93
00:14:23,802 --> 00:14:29,482
I guess I'll be running along now.
You lunatic!

94
00:14:33,804 --> 00:14:37,522
Flash, the doors!

95
00:15:02,553 --> 00:15:07,273
Sit down! Keep a foot on the pedal,
or the G-forces will kill us all.

96
00:15:07,721 --> 00:15:11,121
My God, we're moving.

97
00:15:11,346 --> 00:15:17,946
For God's sake,
strap yourselves down! Quick!

98
00:15:37,224 --> 00:15:41,664
The red pedal!

99
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:49,900
Friendship.
Built this to send in friendship...

100
00:15:50,726 --> 00:15:53,566
The end, now...

101
00:15:53,934 --> 00:16:01,653
Unless we three can...
Unless we can...

102
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:15,217
Strange object
in the imperial vortex.

103
00:17:15,648 --> 00:17:19,528
What distance?

104
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:25,539
Parallel to star field Zygma 12,
approaching.

105
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:35,550
- Test object for life waves.
- Positive, form unknown.

106
00:17:35,982 --> 00:17:39,742
Approximate Mong Scale 3.

107
00:17:44,025 --> 00:17:48,385
Object entering our control range,
approaching the Sea of Fire.

108
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:53,857
Bring it through safely. Land it.

109
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:38,135
Wake up, Dale. We're okay.

110
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:43,009
It's me, Flash. Remember?
We're on the ground.

111
00:18:43,447 --> 00:18:48,607
- Back home?
- I don't think so.

112
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:06,438
Hello. We're from Earth. Friends.

113
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:22,483
Whoever they are,
it's clear they are highly developed.

114
00:19:22,907 --> 00:19:28,627
- I'm sure we can reason with them.
- Want to bet on it?

115
00:19:34,701 --> 00:19:38,620
- My God!
- Is this a Civic Reception?

116
00:19:39,034 --> 00:19:43,034
- More like a police state.
- That could be our good luck.

117
00:19:43,451 --> 00:19:46,091
It means we'll find allies everywhere.

118
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:50,571
They're just waiting for someone
to lead them in revolt.

119
00:19:50,994 --> 00:19:57,874
- Are you looking at me, Zarkov?
- Please. I just want to get home.

120
00:19:59,745 --> 00:20:05,544
Guards, halt.
Prisoners, follow me.

121
00:20:17,078 --> 00:20:23,278
Halt, Lizard Man!
Escape is impossible. Surrender.

122
00:20:26,288 --> 00:20:30,088
Prisoners, march below me
to Emperor Ming.

123
00:20:30,497 --> 00:20:34,697
Let's not argue. Here, hold my hand.

124
00:20:35,123 --> 00:20:40,323
- You want to reason with that?
- If it fails, I still have the gun.

125
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:45,029
Don't worry. I'll make it plain
I'm acting on my own.

126
00:20:45,456 --> 00:20:49,096
- It's plain suicide.
- It's a rational transaction.

127
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:53,899
- One life for billions.
- Halt!

128
00:21:01,165 --> 00:21:05,085
Proceed.

129
00:21:59,003 --> 00:22:04,003
Hail Ming, hail!
Ruler of the universe!

130
00:22:04,462 --> 00:22:09,262
Hail, Ming! Emperor of the galaxy!

131
00:22:09,713 --> 00:22:15,033
The tributes of the Hawkmen
will be first.

132
00:22:16,089 --> 00:22:19,088
- Are we dreaming?
- I'd like to think so.

133
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:24,783
The fabled Ice Jewel of Frigia.

134
00:22:25,256 --> 00:22:30,376
- We seized it in battle.
- Stop!

135
00:22:31,631 --> 00:22:36,791
The Ice Jewel is our tribute,
not Vultan's.

136
00:22:37,257 --> 00:22:41,337
Vultan stole it
while we were burying our dead.

137
00:22:41,758 --> 00:22:46,557
- You are a thief.
- What?

138
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:52,578
Let down your weapons!

139
00:22:53,049 --> 00:22:57,089
No one, but no one,
dies in the palace -

140
00:22:57,508 --> 00:23:02,588
- Without a command
from the Emperor.

141
00:23:07,382 --> 00:23:11,502
Hail Ming.

142
00:23:13,133 --> 00:23:20,213
You obey...
Or you sacrifice your daughter.

143
00:23:27,301 --> 00:23:31,181
Hail Ming.

144
00:23:33,427 --> 00:23:38,587
Now the tributes from Ardentia.

145
00:23:39,052 --> 00:23:43,172
Your Majesty,
we, the people of Ardentia. -

146
00:23:43,595 --> 00:23:46,795
- Have suffered
since you blasted our kingdom.

147
00:23:47,178 --> 00:23:50,938
I can offer you nothing
except my loyalty.

148
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:56,065
Prince Thun,
we prize nothing more highly.

149
00:23:56,512 --> 00:24:01,072
- And how great is this loyalty?
- Without measure.

150
00:24:01,513 --> 00:24:07,552
We are delighted to hear it.
Fall on your sword.

151
00:24:08,221 --> 00:24:14,621
Show us this loyalty.
Throw yourself onto your sword.

152
00:24:29,598 --> 00:24:36,158
May this deed of Prince Thun be an
example to all the kingdoms of Mongo.

153
00:24:36,682 --> 00:24:41,122
Death to Ming!

154
00:25:14,768 --> 00:25:18,808
- This Ming's a psycho.
- This Ming is a psycho.

155
00:25:19,227 --> 00:25:25,866
- Who said that?
- The fair-haired prisoner.

156
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:52,952
Come along, Fellini.

157
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,960
Remember me?

158
00:26:07,939 --> 00:26:13,379
- Who are you?
- Flash Gordon. Quarterback.

159
00:26:13,856 --> 00:26:19,016
Dale Arden, Your Highness.
Live and let live, that's my motto.

160
00:26:19,482 --> 00:26:25,402
I'm Hans Zarkov. I kidnapped them
in an effort to save our planet Earth.

161
00:26:25,899 --> 00:26:31,779
An obscure body, which has given you
so much amusement recently.

162
00:26:32,275 --> 00:26:37,314
We're only interested in friendship.
Why do you attack us?

163
00:26:37,775 --> 00:26:40,575
Why not?

164
00:26:40,942 --> 00:26:47,181
Pathetic earthlings.
Hurling your bodies into the void. -

165
00:26:47,692 --> 00:26:51,372
- Without an inkling of
who or what is out here.

166
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:58,616
If you knew anything about
the Universe, you'd hide from it.

167
00:26:59,402 --> 00:27:02,362
Come closer.
Not you!

168
00:27:02,736 --> 00:27:08,655
- You. Let us see you.
- No.

169
00:27:17,945 --> 00:27:22,145
- Dale!
- Don't.

170
00:27:53,989 --> 00:27:58,789
- Did you ever see such response?
- No. Truly.

171
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,799
She even rivals your daughter.

172
00:28:13,906 --> 00:28:17,586
- What happened?
- Don't know, but it was sensational.

173
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:21,190
Remove the Earth woman.

174
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:27,094
Prepare her for our pleasure.

175
00:28:28,492 --> 00:28:34,292
Forget it, Ming. Dale's with me.

176
00:28:35,076 --> 00:28:40,556
- Stay back!
- Don't, Flash, they'll kill you.

177
00:28:55,036 --> 00:29:00,476
I'll go with them, just...
You...!

178
00:29:28,122 --> 00:29:30,840
Klytus!

179
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:35,643
Are your men on the right pills?

180
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:41,159
Maybe you should execute
their trainer.

181
00:29:51,622 --> 00:29:53,822
Come here!

182
00:29:54,164 --> 00:30:00,804
You fools. He's playing some
barbaric game. Match him, like this.

183
00:30:04,082 --> 00:30:09,922
- Forty one! Forty two!
- Go, Flash, go.

184
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:16,018
Go, Flash, go!

185
00:30:47,711 --> 00:30:50,471
Don't kill him yet, Father.

186
00:30:50,835 --> 00:30:55,875
I want him.
Give him to me.

187
00:30:56,336 --> 00:30:59,416
What would Prince Barin say?

188
00:30:59,795 --> 00:31:05,635
I can handle Barin.
Please...

189
00:31:06,921 --> 00:31:10,441
Really, Aura. Your appetites
are too dangerous. I refuse.

190
00:31:10,838 --> 00:31:16,678
Guards! Deliver the scientist
to General Klytus for conditioning.

191
00:31:17,172 --> 00:31:20,772
This one has defied us
before our subjects.

192
00:31:21,173 --> 00:31:27,452
We order him disposed of tonight
by public execution.

193
00:31:28,715 --> 00:31:34,235
This is a public announcement.
Flash Gordon is to be executed -

194
00:31:34,715 --> 00:31:38,715
- at 29.15 Mingo mean time.

195
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:45,771
Fly back to your kingdom.
You may see me sooner than you think.

196
00:31:49,132 --> 00:31:53,212
- Lying bitch.
- I'll come.

197
00:31:53,633 --> 00:31:59,232
If you rocket there right away.
I've a surprise for you.

198
00:31:59,716 --> 00:32:05,675
- Don't you love me?
- I don't trust you.

199
00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:11,689
Just be there.

200
00:32:20,593 --> 00:32:25,193
I demand to see the Governor.

201
00:32:27,676 --> 00:32:31,796
I can hardly breathe in this thing.

202
00:32:32,218 --> 00:32:37,418
Yes, you don't look well. And I'm told
you refused your final meal.

203
00:32:37,886 --> 00:32:42,006
- The chef will be upset.
- Tell him to go to hell!

204
00:32:42,428 --> 00:32:47,948
Gas works more quickly
on an empty stomach. Any requests?

205
00:32:48,429 --> 00:32:53,829
- Let me see Dale right away.
- Oh, dear. How pathetic.

206
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:57,345
Yes, I anticipated that.

207
00:32:57,722 --> 00:33:01,681
Bring in the Emperor's concubine.

208
00:33:02,096 --> 00:33:08,896
- Oh, my God!
- I said I want to see her!

209
00:33:11,306 --> 00:33:17,586
You have until the sands run out.

210
00:33:21,682 --> 00:33:25,761
Pathetic...

211
00:33:27,765 --> 00:33:33,284
You look great.
No kidding, you look great.

212
00:33:33,765 --> 00:33:38,885
It's the eye make-up. I hope
I remember the trick when I wake up.

213
00:33:39,349 --> 00:33:42,789
That's exactly
what I was gonna tell you.

214
00:33:43,183 --> 00:33:47,541
This isn't happening.
It's just a bad dream.

215
00:33:47,974 --> 00:33:49,894
I agree completely.

216
00:33:50,224 --> 00:33:55,984
We'll wake up any minute
in Dark Harbor and laugh about this.

217
00:33:56,475 --> 00:34:01,195
Only, next time I'll walk over
and talk to you.

218
00:34:01,642 --> 00:34:06,881
- Promise?
- Cross my heart and hope to...

219
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:12,030
- I really will talk to you, Dale.
- What if we're wrong?

220
00:34:12,476 --> 00:34:17,636
- What if it isn't a dream?
- You'll find Zarkov, save the Earth.

221
00:34:18,102 --> 00:34:24,062
He'll get you home in the capsule.
Don't think of me, think of...

222
00:34:24,811 --> 00:34:28,891
Don't look at it.

223
00:34:30,353 --> 00:34:36,072
It won't turn over...
It won't turn over.

224
00:35:27,942 --> 00:35:32,782
Did you enjoy yourselves on Sybaria?
I hear you flew the Doctor there.

225
00:35:33,234 --> 00:35:37,274
Klytus kindly fed me the information.

226
00:35:37,693 --> 00:35:43,052
He wants me himself. His agents
are always making up lies about me.

227
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:25,680
Look!
Water is leaking from her eyes.

228
00:36:26,153 --> 00:36:32,312
It's what they call tears,
a sign of their weakness.

229
00:36:48,113 --> 00:36:52,473
This will help you on your way.

230
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:20,033
Flash!

231
00:37:44,952 --> 00:37:50,071
FLASH GORDON -
EARTHLING EXECUTED BY MING

232
00:38:04,494 --> 00:38:08,054
Hurry.

233
00:38:13,578 --> 00:38:18,178
You know what happens
if I'm found out.

234
00:38:18,621 --> 00:38:23,100
I'm a fool for you, Aura.

235
00:38:23,537 --> 00:38:27,417
There we are. Sybaria again,
same place, next weekend?

236
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:32,109
I can hardly wait.

237
00:38:56,331 --> 00:39:02,451
- Where am I?
- Back from the dead. I saved you.

238
00:39:02,957 --> 00:39:06,837
- How?
- By magic, of course.

239
00:39:07,249 --> 00:39:12,329
- With a kiss, because I like you.
- Where's Dale and Zarkov?

240
00:39:12,792 --> 00:39:19,752
They're safe. Put this uniform on
before the Lizard Men come.

241
00:39:20,751 --> 00:39:25,430
Don't worry, I won't look.

242
00:39:25,876 --> 00:39:29,636
I like you a lot.

243
00:39:34,419 --> 00:39:38,139
- Where are you taking me?
- To the moon Arboria.

244
00:39:38,544 --> 00:39:41,544
I've got to rescue my friends
and save Earth.

245
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:47,680
Pretty risky telling that
to the Emperor's daughter.

246
00:39:49,254 --> 00:39:53,214
- What's in Arboria?
- People who'll help you.

247
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:58,909
- Prince Barin does anything I ask.
- That's Zarkov!

248
00:40:01,088 --> 00:40:06,687
They're just conditioning him
to our climate. Keep out of sight.

249
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:15,548
Every thousand years I test
each life system in the universe.

250
00:40:16,045 --> 00:40:22,605
I visit it with mysteries,
earthquakes, unpredicted eclipses.

251
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:26,170
Strange craters in the wilderness.

252
00:40:26,547 --> 00:40:31,146
If these are taken as natural, I judge
that system ignorant and harmless.

253
00:40:31,588 --> 00:40:37,988
I spare it. But if the hand of Ming
is recognized in these events -

254
00:40:38,506 --> 00:40:45,666
- I judge that system dangerous.
I call upon the great god Dyzan.

255
00:40:46,215 --> 00:40:53,775
And for his greater glory,
and our mutual pleasure...

256
00:40:54,966 --> 00:40:58,166
I destroy it utterly.

257
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:03,549
So it's my fault
Earth is being destroyed?

258
00:41:04,008 --> 00:41:08,488
Precisely, Doctor.

259
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:16,052
I thought it might amuse you to
know this, before your mind is gone.

260
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:21,470
Proceed with it.

261
00:41:25,677 --> 00:41:29,117
What are you doing to me?

262
00:41:29,511 --> 00:41:32,910
We're just emptying your mind.

263
00:41:33,302 --> 00:41:39,302
We are going to empty your memory
as we might empty your pockets...

264
00:41:39,803 --> 00:41:44,843
- Doctor...
- No, don't. Please. I beg you.

265
00:41:45,303 --> 00:41:50,223
My mind is all I have. I've spent
my whole life trying to fill it.

266
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:54,839
Begin.

267
00:42:38,432 --> 00:42:42,512
Now he showed promise.

268
00:42:58,392 --> 00:43:02,512
Papa!

269
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:27,229
- Hold it there.
- Reprogram now?

270
00:43:27,603 --> 00:43:30,923
Yes.

271
00:43:31,312 --> 00:43:36,352
But don't fill him with anything above
level three. His mind can't take it.

272
00:43:36,813 --> 00:43:39,732
I understand. Level three only.

273
00:43:40,104 --> 00:43:42,624
I have to attend to something.

274
00:43:42,979 --> 00:43:47,619
- Can you manage without me?
- I'll try.

275
00:43:48,063 --> 00:43:51,583
I'll return.

276
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:55,820
Begin to reprogram.

277
00:43:56,731 --> 00:44:01,331
Continue to level six.
I gave you an order.

278
00:44:01,773 --> 00:44:06,452
Program the subject to level six.

279
00:44:17,607 --> 00:44:20,167
Try again.

280
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:28,042
Your left hand controls direction,
right does the altitude.

281
00:44:28,393 --> 00:44:33,198
And use your fingers too this time.

282
00:44:36,524 --> 00:44:41,124
Gently, darling,
it's extremely sensitive...

283
00:44:41,567 --> 00:44:45,126
- Like me.
- What's that?

284
00:44:45,524 --> 00:44:50,004
The planet Aquaria.

285
00:44:54,609 --> 00:45:01,569
Now take a left over Frigia,
the next moon rising.

286
00:45:03,652 --> 00:45:10,212
Every moon of Mongo is a kingdom.
My father keeps them fighting.

287
00:45:10,736 --> 00:45:15,855
It's a really brilliant strategy.

288
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:21,719
- Why don't they team up against him?
- Team up? What does that mean?

289
00:45:22,195 --> 00:45:26,554
- Maybe I'll show you sometime.
- Wonderful.

290
00:45:26,986 --> 00:45:31,466
You can do it
when I take you to Cythera.

291
00:45:31,904 --> 00:45:36,104
It's my secret pleasure moon.
I have a little palace there.

292
00:45:36,529 --> 00:45:39,529
- Just for two.

293
00:45:39,905 --> 00:45:45,185
- Wait a minute.
- Oh, Flash, I saved your life.

294
00:45:54,698 --> 00:45:58,578
Drink this.
It has no name.

295
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:03,190
Many brave men died to bring it here
from the Galaxy of Pleasure.

296
00:46:03,615 --> 00:46:08,815
It will make your nights with Ming
more agreeable.

297
00:46:09,283 --> 00:46:11,763
- Will it make me forget?
- No.

298
00:46:12,117 --> 00:46:17,237
But it will make you not mind
remembering.

299
00:46:25,242 --> 00:46:29,442
This isn't bad at all.

300
00:46:33,577 --> 00:46:39,335
It's a thought amplifier. I'm going to
think to Barin to expect us.

301
00:46:39,826 --> 00:46:43,545
- You're kidding. Think to him?
- Of course.

302
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:49,430
- Don't you have telepathy on Earth?
- Could I call Dale on this?

303
00:46:49,909 --> 00:46:55,148
- If I showed you how. But I won't.
- Please, show me.

304
00:46:55,618 --> 00:47:01,858
You'll have to persuade me
much better than that.

305
00:47:04,035 --> 00:47:09,395
What are you doing? Are you mad?
Let go, we're diving into Frigia.

306
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:15,549
- Pull up.
- Just tune me in to Dale.

307
00:47:22,621 --> 00:47:29,380
Dale, it's me, Flash.
Are you getting me?

308
00:47:29,788 --> 00:47:35,628
Oh, my head.
If it only was you.

309
00:47:36,122 --> 00:47:43,162
- She's not getting me.
- Use your brain.

310
00:47:44,123 --> 00:47:49,363
I'm with you, Dale. Just concentrate hard.
It's telepathy.

311
00:47:49,832 --> 00:47:54,432
Can this be real?
I saw you executed.

312
00:47:54,875 --> 00:48:00,234
- I was saved.
- Thank God. Where are you?

313
00:48:00,708 --> 00:48:05,187
In a rocket to Arboria, to get help.
Are you okay?

314
00:48:05,624 --> 00:48:11,064
- I'm locked in Ming's bedroom.
- Fake him out. Girls know how.

315
00:48:11,542 --> 00:48:15,142
It's been done to me.
"Fake him out till I get back."

316
00:48:15,542 --> 00:48:20,102
It's too dangerous for you here.
Stay where you're safe.

317
00:48:20,543 --> 00:48:26,783
- This girl really turns me on...
- I didn't quite get that.

318
00:48:27,294 --> 00:48:32,053
- It wasn't about you.
- What?

319
00:48:32,502 --> 00:48:37,982
I've got to go, someone's coming.
Got to stop thinking to each other.

320
00:48:40,003 --> 00:48:44,521
His Imperial Highness
will be here very soon.

321
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:49,840
- Shall I pour?
- Please.

322
00:48:50,336 --> 00:48:56,136
- Wouldn't you like a sip?
- No, it's forbidden for us slaves.

323
00:48:56,628 --> 00:49:01,667
It's quality stuff, have some.

324
00:49:02,128 --> 00:49:07,088
We're all girls here, I won't tell.
Just one sip.

325
00:49:07,545 --> 00:49:11,985
Live a little.

326
00:49:18,297 --> 00:49:22,137
Bottoms up.

327
00:49:25,255 --> 00:49:28,175
- What is your name?
- Hans Zarkov.

328
00:49:28,547 --> 00:49:34,066
Agent Zarkov! Number 2133 of the
Anti-Insurgent Espionage Group.

329
00:49:34,547 --> 00:49:37,147
Hail Ming.

330
00:49:37,506 --> 00:49:41,106
Good.

331
00:50:06,259 --> 00:50:10,579
- It's not usually so bad.
- How far to the landing pad?

332
00:50:11,009 --> 00:50:15,969
Six point four. I'll drop the flaps.

333
00:51:11,512 --> 00:51:15,312
You?

334
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:35,810
Over here.

335
00:51:39,308 --> 00:51:43,067
Hey buddy!

336
00:52:40,022 --> 00:52:45,421
I've got her.
Sector 409 beta.

337
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:50,336
Activate Agent Zarkov.

338
00:53:07,606 --> 00:53:11,446
Dr. Zarkov.
You're a sight for sore eyes.

339
00:53:11,856 --> 00:53:15,536
- Rest a minute.
- I can't.

340
00:53:15,939 --> 00:53:19,259
We've got to join up with Flash.
He's alive.

341
00:53:19,648 --> 00:53:23,887
I talked to him by telepathy.
He went to Arboria to get help.

342
00:53:24,314 --> 00:53:27,954
- Incredible.
- There's soldiers everywhere.

343
00:53:28,357 --> 00:53:30,997
- Let me think a moment.
- Unseal the city.

344
00:53:31,357 --> 00:53:37,277
- Allow her to exit with Zarkov.
- I think I can find a way out.

345
00:53:37,774 --> 00:53:42,054
No questions, just follow me.

346
00:53:45,776 --> 00:53:49,735
Dale Arden is under the guidance
of Agent Zarkov.

347
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:55,710
- But Flash Gordon is still alive.
- He was revived by a traitor.

348
00:53:56,193 --> 00:54:00,433
And spirited from the city.
We know this from the Earth girl.

349
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:06,420
- What traitor?
- I have my suspicions.

350
00:54:06,902 --> 00:54:10,582
- Stop at nothing.
- No matter to whom the trail leads?

351
00:54:10,986 --> 00:54:15,506
I said at nothing.

352
00:54:27,196 --> 00:54:30,396
- What's that?
- Their sacred temple.

353
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:37,420
A young man is being initiated.
But we must hide till it's done.

354
00:55:08,739 --> 00:55:12,339
I love initiations.

355
00:55:19,574 --> 00:55:23,454
I am now of age, Green Father.
I ask for the test of manhood.

356
00:55:23,865 --> 00:55:29,505
Choose your passage,
into this world, or the next.

357
00:55:29,991 --> 00:55:35,031
May Arbor guide you.

358
00:56:31,413 --> 00:56:34,773
Send me on my way.

359
00:56:35,164 --> 00:56:41,284
- Spare me the madness.
- I will. Hold him.

360
00:56:47,207 --> 00:56:52,847
- This guy is going to help me?
- Stay.

361
00:56:58,084 --> 00:57:05,043
That was extremely moving.
I do sometimes keep a promise.

362
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:14,759
- Prepare a feast.
- No, I have to get back right away.

363
00:57:15,210 --> 00:57:22,768
- Then why did you come?
- I brought you a present. Flash?

364
00:57:29,334 --> 00:57:32,173
Welcome back from the grave.

365
00:57:32,542 --> 00:57:35,502
I knew you were up to something,
but not necrophilia.

366
00:57:35,875 --> 00:57:39,555
Just keep him for me until my father
has had his way with Dale Arden.

367
00:57:39,959 --> 00:57:44,879
I'll keep him all right! In my larder.
Take him, with the rest of the meat.

368
00:57:45,335 --> 00:57:51,815
I forbid it. If you kill Flash,
you'll never have me again.

369
00:57:52,336 --> 00:57:56,936
What danger is there?
Everyone thinks he's dead.

370
00:57:57,378 --> 00:58:02,178
- I'll take him to Cythera next week.
- Harboring a fugitive is treason.

371
00:58:02,629 --> 00:58:07,948
You're not frightened of Ming.

372
00:58:08,754 --> 00:58:14,354
- You are playing with fire, Aura.
- Of course I am.

373
00:58:21,339 --> 00:58:24,099
Does anyone ever trust her twice?

374
00:58:24,298 --> 00:58:27,738
So they let us escape because Klytus
thought he erased your memory.

375
00:58:28,131 --> 00:58:35,890
Do you know why it failed? I started
to recite Shakespeare, the Talmud. -

376
00:58:36,465 --> 00:58:43,625
- Einstein, anything I could remember,
even The Beatles. It armored me.

377
00:58:44,173 --> 00:58:50,773
They couldn't wipe those things away.
You can't beat the human spirit.

378
00:58:56,592 --> 00:59:02,152
Prince Barin! I'm not your enemy,
Ming is. And you know it.

379
00:59:02,634 --> 00:59:09,313
Ming is the enemy of every creature
on Mongo. Let's team up and fight him.

380
00:59:10,468 --> 00:59:14,988
Lower them into the swamp.

381
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:19,272
We can do it, Barin!

382
00:59:42,594 --> 00:59:47,274
Your lover Barin is harboring
Gordon, is he not?

383
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:50,000
This lying is such a waste of time.

384
00:59:50,345 --> 00:59:56,585
You left with a pilot and returned
alone. Wasn't he Gordon?

385
00:59:57,096 --> 01:00:01,336
Who do you think you're protecting?
The Imperial Surgeon?

386
01:00:01,763 --> 01:00:06,562
- Another lover of yours!
- Your jealousy has made you mad.

387
01:00:07,013 --> 01:00:10,613
Seize the surgeon
on suspicion of treason.

388
01:00:11,014 --> 01:00:15,133
- Prepare him for torture!
- Confess and we won't hurt you.

389
01:00:15,555 --> 01:00:19,715
- We don't like doing this at all.
- Never!

390
01:00:20,139 --> 01:00:23,659
Bring me the bore worms.

391
01:00:24,056 --> 01:00:29,496
No! Not the bore worms.

392
01:00:31,849 --> 01:00:36,449
I'm a princess. My father
will have your head for this.

393
01:00:36,891 --> 01:00:44,690
He'll execute your whole perverted
secret police. I demand to see him!

394
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:49,506
With pleasure.

395
01:00:53,726 --> 01:00:57,886
- Father...
- The traitor is close to confession.

396
01:00:58,310 --> 01:01:02,230
Should we stop the torture?

397
01:01:02,644 --> 01:01:07,924
- No.
- Damn you, father!

398
01:01:12,978 --> 01:01:18,097
- That damn woman's using me again.
- What do you expect?

399
01:01:18,561 --> 01:01:25,320
- I don't know what you see in her.
- Keep playing, fool.

400
01:01:26,145 --> 01:01:32,343
- Fico, I'm going to kill Gordon now.
- And lose the princess forever?

401
01:01:32,852 --> 01:01:39,052
There must be a way to dispose of him
and keep faith with the princess.

402
01:01:39,561 --> 01:01:45,281
- I'm sorry, Flash, I'm finished.
- No, you're not. Get up.

403
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:50,529
Look, someone's coming.

404
01:01:54,021 --> 01:01:57,541
Send him over. Hurry up.

405
01:01:57,938 --> 01:02:02,178
It's no good, Flash.
I can't hold on.

406
01:02:02,605 --> 01:02:07,045
Go on, get in.

407
01:02:07,439 --> 01:02:12,799
Sleep well, you traitor.
We hang you in the morning.

408
01:02:18,816 --> 01:02:22,215
- There's always hope.
- This is better.

409
01:02:22,607 --> 01:02:26,887
I stole the key.
We need weapons to cross the swamp.

410
01:02:27,316 --> 01:02:30,676
They're stored in the temple.
Want to climb up with me?

411
01:02:31,066 --> 01:02:35,426
Hold on, Hawkman.

412
01:02:37,609 --> 01:02:41,129
Nice confession. I commend you.

413
01:02:41,526 --> 01:02:46,805
- Execute her.
- No. Too kind.

414
01:02:47,276 --> 01:02:50,796
Aura will be banished to Frigia
after my wedding.

415
01:02:51,193 --> 01:02:57,232
One year in a cavern of ice
will cool her blood.

416
01:02:57,526 --> 01:03:01,486
And then, who knows?

417
01:03:01,902 --> 01:03:07,422
Perhaps we'll marry her to someone
worthy of her treacherous nature.

418
01:03:07,903 --> 01:03:16,783
- How can I express my gratitude?
- Easily. Get me Gordon and Barin.

419
01:03:20,571 --> 01:03:23,011
With pleasure.

420
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:49,315
Hans, look!

421
01:03:59,656 --> 01:04:04,135
- Hey Vultan!
- Not now.

422
01:04:04,572 --> 01:04:08,252
You'll love this.
See what Brave Blue has caught.

423
01:04:08,656 --> 01:04:12,976
Prince Vultan. Remember us?

424
01:04:13,407 --> 01:04:18,047
Indeed I do, my lovely.

425
01:04:18,491 --> 01:04:22,891
Call the Emperor.
Tell him I have prisoners.

426
01:04:23,325 --> 01:04:26,605
- You wouldn't!
- Are you mad, Vultan?

427
01:04:26,992 --> 01:04:32,711
You hate Ming. You're only waiting
for the moment to attack.

428
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,160
Yes, and Ming knows it, too.

429
01:04:36,534 --> 01:04:41,694
By delivering you,
I allay his suspicions.

430
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:47,720
- I gain time.
- Our weapons are inferior.

431
01:04:48,202 --> 01:04:52,362
Ming's not unbeatable.
He couldn't even kill Flash.

432
01:04:52,786 --> 01:04:58,026
- Gordon's alive?
- In Arboria with Prince Barin.

433
01:04:58,495 --> 01:05:02,214
I tell you, now is the time to strike.

434
01:05:13,538 --> 01:05:18,458
- Where are the weapons?
- Feel one.

435
01:05:24,830 --> 01:05:29,710
- Do you know where you are?
- Up the creek.

436
01:05:30,164 --> 01:05:33,403
You've trespassed.

437
01:05:33,789 --> 01:05:40,069
A stranger in this temple
must try the Wood Beast, or die...

438
01:05:40,581 --> 01:05:44,621
That figures.

439
01:05:45,665 --> 01:05:49,903
You came here of your own free will.
However. -

440
01:05:50,331 --> 01:05:56,851
- Because of my word to Aura,
I swear by Arbor I'll not kill you...

441
01:05:57,373 --> 01:06:00,973
Unless you beg me to.

442
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:05,253
The Beast lies somewhere
in the stump. Choose a passage.

443
01:06:05,665 --> 01:06:09,385
No way.

444
01:06:13,583 --> 01:06:18,463
- Coward.
- Let's do it.

445
01:06:33,627 --> 01:06:37,026
Must be my lucky day.

446
01:06:37,418 --> 01:06:41,298
You scared?

447
01:06:48,627 --> 01:06:53,347
What would Aura think of you now?

448
01:07:03,463 --> 01:07:07,903
Second down.

449
01:07:12,463 --> 01:07:14,823
Your play.

450
01:07:15,171 --> 01:07:18,971
No, yours.

451
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:26,540
- Are you sure these are the rules?
- They've just been changed.

452
01:07:49,425 --> 01:07:53,705
Death is certain,
but only after tortured madness.

453
01:07:54,134 --> 01:07:59,052
- How long?
- It depends on your strength.

454
01:07:59,508 --> 01:08:04,787
Please, end it now.

455
01:08:05,341 --> 01:08:10,301
Tricked you, Barin.
Back off!

456
01:08:10,758 --> 01:08:16,477
One move and you're looking
for a new prince.

457
01:08:18,217 --> 01:08:24,937
Leave him! He's mine.
I hunt him alone.

458
01:09:58,268 --> 01:10:02,388
What the hell is going on?

459
01:10:27,227 --> 01:10:33,067
This is one grave
you won't be returning from.

460
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:38,030
Vultan wants a word.

461
01:10:56,896 --> 01:11:01,856
Excuse me for waking you. We scanned
a Hawkman patrol 400 Mongo miles east.

462
01:11:02,314 --> 01:11:06,834
They have Gordon and Prince Barin.

463
01:11:08,064 --> 01:11:13,144
- When do we reach Vultan's kingdom?
- Estimating sixteen.

464
01:11:13,607 --> 01:11:18,367
Wake me when it's in sight.

465
01:11:25,941 --> 01:11:30,461
- You'd sell us to Ming?
- Come on, Barin.

466
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:36,339
Do you expect mercy here? What
would you do if I were your captive?

467
01:11:36,817 --> 01:11:41,337
Remind you of
Article 17 of Ming's Law:

468
01:11:41,775 --> 01:11:45,496
"No prince of Mongo
shall be offered for ransom -

469
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:49,222
- without trial by combat."

470
01:11:49,610 --> 01:11:55,131
Is there such an article?
What a damned nuisance.

471
01:11:55,611 --> 01:12:03,410
- And... who do you choose to fight?
- Him.

472
01:12:05,944 --> 01:12:09,304
This is a lunatic asylum.

473
01:12:09,695 --> 01:12:13,773
- Where are we being taken now?
- Ssh, I'm calculating.

474
01:12:14,193 --> 01:12:19,992
Time remaining before the moon crashes
on Earth. I'd say, roughly...

475
01:12:20,486 --> 01:12:23,926
Fourteen hours, nine minutes
and twenty seconds.

476
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:29,079
And we haven't even found...
Flash!

477
01:12:33,277 --> 01:12:37,518
Last time I saw you
I prayed it was a dream.

478
01:12:37,945 --> 01:12:42,906
This time I pray it's not.
Are you okay? Me too.

479
01:12:43,363 --> 01:12:49,162
- I've got some crazy stories to tell.
- Save them for our kids.

480
01:12:49,656 --> 01:12:56,776
- Enough!
- Leave us alone! I just got engaged.

481
01:13:08,782 --> 01:13:14,862
Let the combat begin! To the death.

482
01:13:48,119 --> 01:13:52,399
Give me the remote control.

483
01:13:55,412 --> 01:13:59,532
Come on!

484
01:14:02,954 --> 01:14:06,833
He's tilting it.

485
01:14:14,121 --> 01:14:17,801
Watch out!

486
01:14:32,372 --> 01:14:36,052
- Present from Vultan.
- Brute! Give me that.

487
01:14:36,455 --> 01:14:40,935
- Bastard!
- Flash!

488
01:14:46,038 --> 01:14:50,718
Come on, finish him.

489
01:15:22,917 --> 01:15:26,437
Flash! I love you.

490
01:15:26,835 --> 01:15:32,235
But we only have 14 hours
to save the Earth.

491
01:15:46,961 --> 01:15:50,961
How's that feel, Arborian?

492
01:16:00,505 --> 01:16:07,464
If you kill me, promise to team up
with Vultan and fight Ming.

493
01:16:09,505 --> 01:16:13,104
Goodbye, Barin.

494
01:16:19,005 --> 01:16:25,125
- Take my hand.
- You've won, let him go.

495
01:16:34,506 --> 01:16:38,226
That's it, Prince.

496
01:16:40,215 --> 01:16:45,214
- What is this?
- Humanity.

497
01:17:05,592 --> 01:17:10,352
Where you go, I follow.

498
01:17:12,593 --> 01:17:16,592
Listen to me!

499
01:17:17,009 --> 01:17:21,209
There is something finer
in this galaxy than Ming's law.

500
01:17:21,635 --> 01:17:25,674
Rubbish!

501
01:17:30,427 --> 01:17:34,867
Hawkmen, to your posts!

502
01:17:56,679 --> 01:18:00,199
Agent Zarkov,
you will be liquidated for treachery.

503
01:18:00,597 --> 01:18:04,797
Vultan!
Surrender the fugitives at once. -

504
01:18:05,222 --> 01:18:10,102
- Or the Imperial Fleet will blast
your kingdom to atoms.

505
01:18:13,265 --> 01:18:16,065
- Step forward, Barin.
- "Prince" Barin.

506
01:18:16,432 --> 01:18:22,271
Princess Aura has implicated you
on a charge of high treason.

507
01:18:22,765 --> 01:18:26,285
- A prison ship will take you away.
- You tortured Aura.

508
01:18:26,683 --> 01:18:30,163
Interesting girl. I think
she found it rather enjoyable.

509
01:18:30,558 --> 01:18:34,518
Klytus.

510
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:54,830
The first step forward.

511
01:18:55,224 --> 01:19:00,464
Into the air, Hawkpeople.
Fly for your lives!

512
01:19:00,933 --> 01:19:06,373
You damned hothead, you brought down
destruction on my kingdom.

513
01:19:06,851 --> 01:19:10,011
He showed us the way.
Fight with us.

514
01:19:10,393 --> 01:19:14,673
- Against the Imperial Fleet?
- They won't expect resistance.

515
01:19:15,102 --> 01:19:17,902
- We'll take them by surprise.
- We can do it.

516
01:19:18,269 --> 01:19:25,228
You're all mad! My duty is
to protect my people. Evacuate!

517
01:19:25,769 --> 01:19:30,249
- Then take us with you.
- Impossible, we can't carry more.

518
01:19:30,686 --> 01:19:34,086
- You're leaving us to die?
- You know Ming's law.

519
01:19:34,479 --> 01:19:38,519
Outside his own kingdom,
the hunter becomes the hunted.

520
01:19:38,937 --> 01:19:45,577
- Traitor!
- Save your breath. Fly!

521
01:19:52,314 --> 01:19:54,514
Help me pull these down.

522
01:19:54,856 --> 01:19:57,775
We'll make parachutes
and jump to Arboria.

523
01:19:58,147 --> 01:20:00,187
We'll kill ourselves.

524
01:20:00,523 --> 01:20:04,722
A body reaches maximum velocity
within a few hundred feet.

525
01:20:05,147 --> 01:20:12,587
- We'll need some rope.
- My God, what is that?

526
01:20:13,524 --> 01:20:19,924
It's Ming.
We must stop him.

527
01:20:26,234 --> 01:20:29,753
- Blast them?
- Not yet. Send down a shuttle.

528
01:20:30,150 --> 01:20:34,110
- Bring back Barin, Zarkov and Dale.
- And Gordon?

529
01:20:34,525 --> 01:20:40,005
Leave him there.
Prepare my Imperial Lander.

530
01:20:46,108 --> 01:20:49,628
Why aren't I going with them?

531
01:20:50,026 --> 01:20:55,946
- I've got other plans for you.
- I can imagine.

532
01:20:56,443 --> 01:21:03,962
- You want to destroy me.
- It's the only way to save Earth.

533
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:10,526
- What if I granted you a kingdom?
- If you what?

534
01:21:10,986 --> 01:21:15,386
Ming the Merciless,
ruler of the universe. -

535
01:21:15,820 --> 01:21:22,500
- Offers Flash Gordon a kingdom
of Mongo, to rule over as his own.

536
01:21:23,029 --> 01:21:28,188
You're crazy. Why would you do that?

537
01:21:28,654 --> 01:21:33,173
Because I've never met your like.
You're a hero, don't you see that?

538
01:21:33,612 --> 01:21:41,132
Who better to rule a kingdom?
Your moon is very close now.

539
01:21:41,696 --> 01:21:47,536
- Earth's end might come within hours.
- You'd call off the attack?

540
01:21:48,030 --> 01:21:50,750
- I could.
- Everyone would be saved?

541
01:21:51,114 --> 01:21:56,074
Yes, and no.

542
01:21:56,990 --> 01:22:01,590
After the earthquakes and tidal waves,
they won't be the same human beings.

543
01:22:02,032 --> 01:22:06,951
They'll be more tractable. Easier
for you to rule, in the name of Ming.

544
01:22:07,407 --> 01:22:15,847
- You mean slaves?
- Let's say 'satisfied with less'.

545
01:22:17,075 --> 01:22:23,675
- What about Dale?
- We have decided to marry her.

546
01:22:24,201 --> 01:22:27,481
She's exceptional.
We'll breed with her -

547
01:22:27,868 --> 01:22:32,988
- And send our progeny back
to populate your Earth.

548
01:22:33,452 --> 01:22:39,771
Do you really prefer death
to a kingdom? I'm disappointed.

549
01:22:40,286 --> 01:22:47,045
I'd rather see you on my side
than scattered into...

550
01:22:48,994 --> 01:22:51,514
Atoms.

551
01:22:51,869 --> 01:22:56,987
But as you wish.

552
01:22:58,327 --> 01:23:05,407
We'll return to the Imperial Rocket.
Leave the Earthling here to his doom.

553
01:23:17,912 --> 01:23:22,912
- Beam another blast.
- You murderer.

554
01:23:59,875 --> 01:24:04,555
Flash. I loved you.

555
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:13,549
- They were brave creatures.
- Shut up!

556
01:24:13,958 --> 01:24:20,198
With respect, the man who rid us
of Klytus should not be deserted.

557
01:24:20,709 --> 01:24:26,949
So... maybe I'd do it different
if I had it over again.

558
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:33,860
- Then fight.
- I can't help a man who's dead!

559
01:24:34,377 --> 01:24:40,577
Flash Gordon to Vultan.
Mayday, mayday.

560
01:24:41,170 --> 01:24:45,769
This is Vultan. I read you.
Where are you?

561
01:24:46,211 --> 01:24:53,491
- Flying blind on a rocket cycle.
- Flying blind on a rocket cycle?

562
01:24:54,046 --> 01:24:58,726
We're in Arboria.
I'll send you a homing beam.

563
01:24:59,172 --> 01:25:04,970
For what it's worth,
Ming's got Dale, Zarkov and Barin.

564
01:25:05,420 --> 01:25:10,540
- I see. My thanks to you.
- What for?

565
01:25:11,004 --> 01:25:16,004
Well... for giving a dumb old bird
a second chance.

566
01:25:16,464 --> 01:25:20,943
Over to homing beam.

567
01:25:33,381 --> 01:25:37,381
Don't touch me!

568
01:25:38,298 --> 01:25:42,018
- You!
- Stop! I'm a prisoner too.

569
01:25:42,423 --> 01:25:49,262
Damned Mongo person! You couldn't
tell the truth to save your life.

570
01:25:51,090 --> 01:25:56,570
- Stop! I'm going to be exiled.
- Liar!

571
01:25:57,049 --> 01:26:01,089
Liar.

572
01:26:06,717 --> 01:26:13,677
- Is this another trick, Aura?
- Is this a trick?

573
01:26:14,218 --> 01:26:19,178
Could I cry
if my heart hadn't changed?

574
01:26:19,636 --> 01:26:25,035
I've been such a spoiled fool.
I never knew what my father was...

575
01:26:25,511 --> 01:26:29,471
Until he let Klytus use bore worms.

576
01:26:29,886 --> 01:26:34,846
I believe you.
But I don't trust you.

577
01:26:35,304 --> 01:26:40,424
You're of Ming's blood. You'll cosy up
with him again in the morning.

578
01:26:40,888 --> 01:26:45,487
Not if you give him this.
It's deadly poison.

579
01:26:45,929 --> 01:26:49,809
He always drinks a power potion
before making love.

580
01:26:50,221 --> 01:26:56,540
- Drop this into his glass tonight.
- I can't. I gave him my word.

581
01:26:57,055 --> 01:27:00,975
- What word?
- To be a good wife...

582
01:27:01,389 --> 01:27:04,909
If he'd spare Zarkov and Barin.
He vowed he would.

583
01:27:05,306 --> 01:27:10,104
My father has never kept a vow.

584
01:27:10,555 --> 01:27:16,395
Keeping our word is one of the things
that make us better than you.

585
01:27:17,222 --> 01:27:23,222
A guard will take you to the waiting
room. Your Joyous Time has come.

586
01:27:23,723 --> 01:27:28,042
You are to be prepared
for your wedding.

587
01:27:28,473 --> 01:27:33,873
I'm lost. Nothing can save me now.

588
01:27:48,142 --> 01:27:51,182
Flash Gordon approaching.

589
01:27:51,559 --> 01:27:56,039
What do you mean,
'Flash Gordon approaching'?

590
01:27:56,476 --> 01:28:00,915
On a rocket cycle.
Shall I inform His Majesty?

591
01:28:01,351 --> 01:28:05,750
The Emperor would shoot you
for interrupting his wedding.

592
01:28:06,184 --> 01:28:10,264
Fire when Gordon's in range.

593
01:28:30,061 --> 01:28:37,181
He's escaping, idiot!
Dispatch War Rocket Ajax.

594
01:28:57,107 --> 01:29:00,986
Charge the boosters.

595
01:29:09,691 --> 01:29:16,371
- Flash Gordon in range, Captain.
- Fire!

596
01:29:20,899 --> 01:29:26,778
- Shall we go in after him?
- No. Reduce velocity.

597
01:29:32,649 --> 01:29:37,728
Our trap worked.
They'll follow me for sure.

598
01:29:38,191 --> 01:29:42,351
Stand by, my Hawkmen!

599
01:29:45,483 --> 01:29:51,043
- He's not coming out, sir.
- Prepare to electrify cloud.

600
01:29:51,526 --> 01:29:58,486
Prepare sky nets to catch
Gordon's body. Fire capacitators.

601
01:30:03,236 --> 01:30:09,395
- They're trying to flush you out.
- Let's go in.

602
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:20,840
Good. They're coming through.

603
01:30:43,781 --> 01:30:49,540
Squadron 40... Dive!

604
01:31:05,491 --> 01:31:09,370
Arm topside!

605
01:31:22,243 --> 01:31:26,721
Second wave. Dive!

606
01:31:57,244 --> 01:32:01,284
Stop engines. Repel boarders.

607
01:32:41,623 --> 01:32:48,302
- Biro's hit. I'm going in after him.
- Impetuous boy.

608
01:32:49,582 --> 01:32:55,182
Oh well, who wants to live forever?

609
01:32:56,083 --> 01:33:00,043
Dive!

610
01:33:54,336 --> 01:33:58,456
Biro, hold on, I'm coming.

611
01:33:59,045 --> 01:34:05,165
- You all right?
- They winged me. Detonate the mine.

612
01:34:08,754 --> 01:34:12,514
Blow it, Flash!

613
01:34:17,297 --> 01:34:21,776
Let's get out of here.

614
01:34:26,589 --> 01:34:30,229
Well done, Flash. Here.
Up there, Luro!

615
01:34:30,631 --> 01:34:34,511
Come on.

616
01:34:38,549 --> 01:34:42,789
Full velocity, all drives.

617
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:04,600
Attention, all citizens.

618
01:35:04,967 --> 01:35:10,647
Behold the face
of your Empress to be.

619
01:35:11,968 --> 01:35:17,488
While you await the ceremony,
all channels will display -

620
01:35:17,969 --> 01:35:23,569
- the execution of the traitors,
Barin and Zarkov.

621
01:35:35,554 --> 01:35:39,874
Pick that up, would you?

622
01:35:47,220 --> 01:35:50,940
Tell me more about this Houdini.

623
01:35:51,346 --> 01:35:55,906
This is it.
At least it'll be over quickly.

624
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:08,223
Scanner malfunction,
area 7-7 delta, under repair.

625
01:36:18,347 --> 01:36:22,107
- They've changed the code.
- I've changed too, Aura.

626
01:36:22,515 --> 01:36:26,235
- I think I can work it out.
- Will you marry me?

627
01:36:26,640 --> 01:36:30,999
We'll try.
Not now, Barin!

628
01:36:31,431 --> 01:36:34,071
If I'm not at the wedding,
I'll be shot.

629
01:36:34,432 --> 01:36:40,832
I thought it was the Zeitman series!
I haven't changed.

630
01:36:46,392 --> 01:36:51,632
Everybody take off! Form a battle
stream behind the rocket.

631
01:36:52,101 --> 01:36:55,541
Flash and me bail out
when the shooting starts.

632
01:36:55,935 --> 01:37:01,015
- And keep your head down.
- See you in Mingo City.

633
01:37:01,476 --> 01:37:07,116
Yes... with luck.
What are you setting there?

634
01:37:07,602 --> 01:37:13,522
That's the time left for the Earth.
In minutes and seconds.

635
01:37:14,020 --> 01:37:18,620
- Level with me. Will this do it?
- Yes, no doubt.

636
01:37:19,062 --> 01:37:24,622
There's a lightning field at the
entrance. When this baby hits it...

637
01:37:25,103 --> 01:37:31,143
It will blow that field dead.
My Hawkmen fly right in.

638
01:37:31,646 --> 01:37:36,405
Let's see what Mingo City's saying.

639
01:37:41,855 --> 01:37:44,935
Oh, my God.

640
01:38:15,315 --> 01:38:18,555
- Rocket Ajax returning.
- With Gordon's body?

641
01:38:18,940 --> 01:38:21,860
I presume so. Communications are off.

642
01:38:22,232 --> 01:38:27,952
- Are they in the proper approach?
- Negative.

643
01:38:28,441 --> 01:38:32,361
- Open fire!
- On Ajax?

644
01:38:32,775 --> 01:38:37,534
All weapons, now!
Charge the lightning field.

645
01:38:37,983 --> 01:38:44,023
I take responsibility,
in the Emperor's name.

646
01:38:50,026 --> 01:38:54,386
Attention, all wedding guests.
There is no cause for alarm.

647
01:38:54,818 --> 01:38:58,978
The weapons are being fired
in continuous salute. -

648
01:38:59,402 --> 01:39:04,602
- In honor of His Majesty's wedding.

649
01:39:09,736 --> 01:39:13,736
Come on, Flash.
It's time to bail out.

650
01:39:14,153 --> 01:39:18,553
Sorry, I'm not coming.
The rocket cycle's gone.

651
01:39:18,987 --> 01:39:23,147
- I'll carry you.
- Bail out, Vultan.

652
01:39:23,571 --> 01:39:27,091
- Are you crazy?
- The fire's too heavy.

653
01:39:27,488 --> 01:39:30,688
We'll never make it
with nobody at the wheel.

654
01:39:31,072 --> 01:39:35,432
- It's suicide, Flash!
- No. A rational transaction.

655
01:39:35,864 --> 01:39:39,904
- One life for billions.
- You'll be destroyed!

656
01:39:40,323 --> 01:39:43,722
Looney bird!
Get out of here, they need you.

657
01:39:44,114 --> 01:39:51,034
- Goodbye, Flash, it's been...
- I know. For me too, Vultan.

658
01:39:51,574 --> 01:39:54,974
Tell Dale I know
it would've been good.

659
01:39:55,366 --> 01:39:58,844
You must come from
one hell of a planet.

660
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:03,800
Not too bad.

661
01:40:12,615 --> 01:40:16,334
Onward, my brave Hawkmen.

662
01:40:16,740 --> 01:40:23,780
Let this be known forever
as Flash Gordon's Day!

663
01:40:25,408 --> 01:40:30,968
- Freeze, you bloody bastards!
- Take us to Ming.

664
01:40:31,450 --> 01:40:35,130
We do not lead traitors
to the Emperor.

665
01:40:35,534 --> 01:40:42,134
We'll find a way.
Grab an imager off an agent.

666
01:40:47,993 --> 01:40:51,993
Zarkov!

667
01:40:54,577 --> 01:40:57,777
- Thank you.
- Ajax still approaching.

668
01:40:58,161 --> 01:41:00,721
Identified Earthling Gordon
at the controls.

669
01:41:01,078 --> 01:41:06,078
We guarantee its destruction in
the lightning field. General Kala?

670
01:41:06,537 --> 01:41:10,097
Please show yourself.

671
01:41:10,496 --> 01:41:14,856
- Let's go.
- We must deactivate the field.

672
01:41:15,289 --> 01:41:19,568
- Where are the atomic generators?
- There's no time.

673
01:41:19,997 --> 01:41:26,076
I'm heading for Sector Alpha 9.
Hold the fort.

674
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:45,520
There must be a way of
deactivating the lightning field.

675
01:42:17,375 --> 01:42:21,294
Do you, Ming the Merciless,
ruler of the universe. -

676
01:42:21,708 --> 01:42:25,948
- Take this Earthling, Dale Arden,
to be your Empress of the hour?

677
01:42:26,376 --> 01:42:32,216
- Of the hour, yes.
- Do you promise to use her?

678
01:42:32,710 --> 01:42:39,390
Not to blast her into space...
until you grow weary of her?

679
01:42:39,919 --> 01:42:44,159
- I do.
- I do not!

680
01:43:08,421 --> 01:43:13,101
Recite after me, Your Majesty.
With this ring...

681
01:43:13,547 --> 01:43:18,907
Matsuna! Ring! Ring!

682
01:43:22,131 --> 01:43:28,890
Recite after me, Your Majesty.
With this ring I thee wed.

683
01:43:29,506 --> 01:43:33,826
Dale, what a damn shame.

684
01:43:38,466 --> 01:43:44,066
Freeze!
Deactivate the lightning field.

685
01:44:06,593 --> 01:44:10,673
- Gordon!
- Flash?

686
01:44:54,555 --> 01:45:01,434
The game's lost. Stop your attack
on Earth, and I'll spare your life.

687
01:45:01,971 --> 01:45:05,211
You pitiful fool.

688
01:45:05,597 --> 01:45:10,317
My life is not
for any Earthling to give. -

689
01:45:10,764 --> 01:45:14,764
- Or take.

690
01:45:17,140 --> 01:45:21,540
Your power's fading, Ming.

691
01:45:44,517 --> 01:45:47,677
The reactors are destroyed.
Glad you made it, Vultan.

692
01:45:48,059 --> 01:45:50,819
Better late than never.

693
01:45:51,184 --> 01:45:54,384
- Dale.
- Look out, Flash.

694
01:45:54,768 --> 01:45:59,728
Don't move. Stay where you are.

695
01:46:00,186 --> 01:46:07,225
Long live Flash. You've saved
your Earth. Have a nice day.

696
01:46:15,562 --> 01:46:19,482
Barin is the rightful heir.

697
01:46:19,896 --> 01:46:23,574
Hail Barin, King of Mongo.

698
01:46:23,977 --> 01:46:27,817
We owe everything to Flash.

699
01:46:28,228 --> 01:46:34,188
We appoint Vultan
General of our armies.

700
01:46:35,687 --> 01:46:42,726
From this day on, let every breed
of Mongo live together in peace.

701
01:46:43,896 --> 01:46:48,655
- Will we ever get out of here, Hans?
- I don't know.

702
01:46:49,104 --> 01:46:53,264
- But we'll try.
- We certainly invite you all to stay.

703
01:46:53,688 --> 01:46:59,568
- What do you think?
- I'm a New York City girl.

704
01:47:00,064 --> 01:47:05,544
It's a little too quiet around here
for me.

705
01:47:16,357 --> 01:47:20,957
THANKS

706
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:31,200
FLASH

707
01:47:32,305 --> 01:47:38,403
