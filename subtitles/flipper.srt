Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

2
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:49,937
It's the big house on the left.
"Casa de Porter"!

3
00:04:10,499 --> 00:04:12,043
Hello?

4
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,899
See ya, Porter!

5
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:25,825
Just the one.
It's not five o'clock yet.

6
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:34,500
I beg your pardon, little pig.
What d'ya say?

7
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:38,921
Sandy? - Yep.
- Thought you were comin' Thursday.

8
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:42,550
It is Thursday.
- Looks like I missed your boat.

9
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,096
Oon't worry, buddy,
Uncle Paul will make it up to you.

10
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:51,684
What is this place anyway?
- It was an abandoned fishing camp.

11
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:56,147
It was a real dump when I got here.

12
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,484
Come aboard, I'll show you around.

13
00:06:01,485 --> 00:06:02,945
Hey! Heel!

14
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,614
Here, boy.

15
00:06:08,075 --> 00:06:09,577
We're in the poo, mate.

16
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:27,011
You like spaghetti this much?
- I'm quite a bargain hunter.

17
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:32,475
When the cruise ships are in the area,
you can do some terrific deals.

18
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:37,688
Any passengers that want Spaghetti-os
are out of luck.

19
00:06:38,814 --> 00:06:40,149
I'm sure.

20
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,903
They're not exactly Omaha steaks,
but you won't go hungry.

21
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:51,452
There's gotta be some mistake.
You cannot be my uncle.

22
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:57,542
You know they say: You can choose
your friends, but not your relatives.

23
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,464
Why don't you unpack?
I'll rustle us up some grub.

24
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:06,926
How much did she pay you
to take me off her hands?

25
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:13,224
I resent that. When your mother
called, I didn't hesitate.

26
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,018
If anyone
knows about divorce, it's me.

27
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,938
I mean, family's very important.

28
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,608
You guys are all I've got.

29
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,026
How much?

30
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:33,035
A hundred dollars a week.
Just for the summer.

31
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:36,706
Oh boy, she really low-balled ya.

32
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,292
Story of my life, kid.

33
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,629
This concert's history.

34
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,110
All aboard!

35
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,116
Come on, sailor! Shake a leg!

36
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:16,078
You don't get up, you don't eat.
Time to rock and roll!

37
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:25,296
Spaghetti-os with or without?
- Without what? - Pee-wee franks.

38
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,800
Suit yourself.

39
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,303
But out on the ocean,

40
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,474
you can't order a pizza.

41
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,729
You ever been fishing?

42
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,779
What d'ya catch? - A whale.
But I threw it back.

43
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:55,201
Most people think fishing's
a bamboo pole and a 6-pack of suds.

44
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,995
But it's tougher than that.
- Oh really.

45
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,456
What about seasickness?

46
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,293
Look, I can handle it.

47
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,975
Sure ya can.

48
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:38,744
Where's the bait, sailor?

49
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,414
Bait my butt!

50
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,226
You okay?

51
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,428
At least it floats!

52
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,723
Funny. Buck-faced wombat!

53
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:49,023
Just keep your eyes on the horizon.
- For how long?

54
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,651
As long as it takes to keep it down.

55
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,130
Oamn dolphins stealing all the bait.
- They're scaring the fish away.

56
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,369
That's not fishing, kid.
That's murder.

57
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:26,954
It's pathetic.

58
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,438
Hey, kid!

59
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,858
You see where that dolphin went?

60
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,446
Yeah.

61
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,116
That way.

62
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,163
You sure?

63
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:23,928
Alright, Oirk!

64
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,055
Come on!

65
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,397
Go on, get outta here!

66
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,109
Go on. Go!

67
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,241
Go!

68
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:17,273
You gonna be at this concert?
- The Chili Peppers are mine!

69
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,026
You're splitting?
- Am I splitting!

70
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:26,657
Hey, Tommy.

71
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,118
You returning to the mainland?

72
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:33,289
I can't make it with no fish.
Fish are gone, I'm gone.

73
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,834
What, you givin' up the good life?

74
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:41,005
Good life's ancient history. I can't
feed a cat with what I catch.

75
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,550
Oon't worry.

76
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:49,096
I'm on the 5 A.M. Ferry.
Pick me up, we'll be at the concert.

77
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,599
Gotta go, it's the hippy!

78
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:57,188
Thought you might
like a change. - Why?

79
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:00,650
I dunno.

80
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,988
Yo, Marvin!

81
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,200
Aren't you a bit warm?

82
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,791
What's with him?
- Marvin's a little shy.

83
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:22,421
Give him a spring and a wire,
he'll make an outboard motor.

84
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,511
I don't want to hurt him.
- But sweetheart...

85
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:33,391
Okay, we'll put him back
in with his friends,

86
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,395
and we'll use this guy.
He won't mind at all.

87
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:40,022
Have fun fishing!
- Okay.

88
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,526
Become a marine biologist
and you can bait hooks too...

89
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:46,988
In Boston you wouldn't get to see me.

90
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:50,366
Just my luck.
This must be Sandy.

91
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,661
Hi, I'm Cathy.
He probably told you about me.

92
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,997
No.

93
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,166
Can you get my stuff?

94
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:08,259
So, how's he doing?
- Like a pizza, but upside down.

95
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:13,681
I'll straighten him out.
You cooking dinner tonight?

96
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,225
Why? You tired of Spaghetti-o's?

97
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,624
You heard Tommy's leaving the island.

98
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,960
We haven't had a decent catch
since spring. - I know why.

99
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:46,714
The fish are loaded with dioxin.

100
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:50,801
What's dioxin?
- It's a by-product of herbicide.

101
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:53,095
How's that getting in our water?

102
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,264
Careful!

103
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:04,148
Will he ever take off that raincoat?

104
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,818
Maybe we could get it cleaned
with him still inside.

105
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:10,279
You never take me seriously!

106
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,950
That's not fair!
Hit me with your best shot.

107
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,702
When are we getting married?

108
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,128
Gotta go fix the net.
- Porter Ricks!

109
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:36,347
Think he'll ever grow up?

110
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,398
What are you doing?

111
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,533
Hey, Sandy. Oo I look cool or what?

112
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:01,951
Or what.

113
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:07,957
It's the shirt. It was given to me
by Brian Wilson. - Who?

114
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:13,212
Brian Wilson. Beach Boys.
What are they teaching you kids?

115
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,259
I'm tired. Gonna hit the hay early.

116
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:21,137
Good. Cathy's number's on the wall.

117
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:24,265
There's spaghetti if you're hungry...
- Yeah.

118
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,476
I'm late. See ya in the A.M., kid.

119
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:31,731
See ya in the A. M... not!

120
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,233
FERRY OEPARTURES

121
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:05,056
Hello?

122
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:38,232
Is that you?

123
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,374
Come on!

124
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:20,710
Cool!

125
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:30,344
Sorry. Gotta jet. See ya!

126
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:03,002
Shake a leg, sailor!
You don't get up, you don't eat.

127
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:10,259
Sandy?

128
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:16,891
Earthquake!

129
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:24,023
Jeez!

130
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,491
Storm's comin'. Board up the windows.

131
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:36,661
I can't, Russ.
Looking for a runaway nephew.

132
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:40,623
Call off the search.
He took the first ferry out.

133
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:49,632
By the way, I'll need $22.50.
He put it on your tab.

134
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:05,690
He's so cute!

135
00:26:18,661 --> 00:26:22,498
Sandy?
I am by nature a gentle soul.

136
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:27,920
However, I can crush a coconut...

137
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:30,256
with my bare hands.

138
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:33,968
Hold that thought
as we make our exit...

139
00:26:35,887 --> 00:26:37,263
with dignity.

140
00:27:02,914 --> 00:27:03,915
Get that rope!

141
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:10,046
Sandy! Get the line!

142
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:44,247
Oamn! Nice going, kid!
- You know what you just did?

143
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:48,000
I probably saved your life.
- You made me blow Chili Peppers.

144
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:52,755
Next concert's in Orlando.
I don't have tickets. - I don't give...

145
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:57,260
Great! Bloody great.
"Yeah, I'd love to see Sandy.

146
00:27:58,678 --> 00:28:00,596
Send him down. It'll be great."

147
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:07,645
Lt'll cost me
my house and my boat, but...

148
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:11,315
I should give up
and join Tommy on the mainland.

149
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:16,612
Why didn't you just let me go?
- I'm not finished with you yet.

150
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:22,285
Oon't talk like my father.
I'm not looking for another father.

151
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:24,871
Good.

152
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:29,250
Make's us even.
'Cause I'm not looking for a son.

153
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:31,961
Especially
a screw-up teenager like you.

154
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:37,550
You don't know me.
You know nothing about me.

155
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:42,013
Tell you what I do know, kid.

156
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:45,516
This here is the earth.

157
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:50,229
This is the great big ocean.
Here's our tiny island. Your mum

158
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:52,106
is way over there.

159
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:57,028
No matter how you scream,
she can't hear ya.

160
00:28:57,862 --> 00:29:03,075
You got no friends, no money,
no malls to hang around. You're stuck.

161
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:05,828
All you have is me.

162
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:09,290
So get used to it.

163
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:14,504
And relax. Got a long, ugly
day ahead of us... and night.

164
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,383
Gonna use that pillow?

165
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:23,137
Thanks.

166
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:49,205
He snored all bloody night!

167
00:30:00,258 --> 00:30:02,134
Oh man!

168
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:13,813
Is nothing sacred?

169
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,862
Jeez!

170
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:25,116
Get off there!

171
00:30:37,128 --> 00:30:38,754
Look...

172
00:30:39,172 --> 00:30:42,925
Since I know you love being here,
I'll make a deal.

173
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:46,679
You work for me,
help clean this mess up,

174
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:49,390
and I'll get you
to that concert in Orlando.

175
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:53,436
How?
I don't even have tickets.

176
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:55,980
Kid, this is Porter Ricks.

177
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:59,650
If it exists, I can get it.
We'll make that show.

178
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:02,820
We?
- Think I'd let you go alone?

179
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:07,867
Besides, I can dig the Chili Peppers.
Not the Beach Boys, but who is?

180
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:09,994
Is it a deal?

181
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:25,760
Haul her in!

182
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:32,350
Start with the fish pan netting. Mast
and stuff's in the shed or in town.

183
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:35,645
I'm gonna have to stay
with the boat on the mainland.

184
00:31:36,062 --> 00:31:38,606
You gonna be alright?
- I'll be fine.

185
00:31:42,151 --> 00:31:44,153
Cathy will drop in on you.

186
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:48,449
You can reach me through
the coastguard station.

187
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:51,160
But nothing's gonna happen, right?
- Right.

188
00:31:52,537 --> 00:31:53,538
Right.

189
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:53,764
You...

190
00:36:59,093 --> 00:37:03,556
Like my dolphin?
- Your dolphin?

191
00:37:04,974 --> 00:37:08,477
That's right. I found him.

192
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:10,771
What's his name?

193
00:37:16,694 --> 00:37:18,487
His name's Flipper.

194
00:37:20,656 --> 00:37:24,076
Never seen one alone like this.

195
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:28,664
Alone he'd be no match for Scar.
- Who's Scar?

196
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:32,251
The hammerhead that stalks
these waters. Big and ugly.

197
00:37:33,002 --> 00:37:38,049
They say he took out a tourist boat.
He likes those out-of-towners.

198
00:37:47,642 --> 00:37:50,436
That jerk tried to kill Flipper.

199
00:37:51,395 --> 00:37:53,606
He was shooting at him.

200
00:37:54,565 --> 00:37:57,443
That's Oirk Moran, a bottom-feeder.

201
00:37:59,737 --> 00:38:03,491
What are you doing?
- I'm hypnotizing him.

202
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,535
It's not working.

203
00:38:07,537 --> 00:38:09,455
You make him do something.

204
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:15,044
Okay. Sure.

205
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,589
Alright.

206
00:38:19,632 --> 00:38:20,716
Alright, Flipper...

207
00:38:21,926 --> 00:38:24,011
What do you wanna do today?

208
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:34,230
Jump!

209
00:38:41,696 --> 00:38:42,947
Awesome!

210
00:38:43,364 --> 00:38:46,242
You know...
- Where did he go?

211
00:39:08,806 --> 00:39:10,808
I'm Kim.
- Sandy.

212
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:16,647
He's hungry.
- Really?

213
00:39:17,064 --> 00:39:20,276
Where d'you get fish to feed him?
- Feed him?

214
00:39:21,569 --> 00:39:24,906
He's your dolphin.
- Well, yeah...

215
00:39:26,449 --> 00:39:28,201
Come on, I got an idea.

216
00:39:41,714 --> 00:39:44,800
Lookin' good, Porter.
- Thanks.

217
00:39:46,427 --> 00:39:49,847
Oid most of it myself.
Most of it.

218
00:39:50,306 --> 00:39:52,308
Now I just have to pay for it.

219
00:39:52,725 --> 00:39:57,063
Take a lesson from your nephew.
He's becoming quite a businessman.

220
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:00,525
What's he been up to?
- You'll see!

221
00:40:04,779 --> 00:40:09,825
Fish go in the bucket. One dollar
to see Flipper, the Wonder Oolphin.

222
00:40:13,913 --> 00:40:14,914
FLIPPER THE WONOER OOLPHIN

223
00:40:15,373 --> 00:40:18,334
One dollar. Oid you put your fish in?

224
00:40:18,751 --> 00:40:21,671
One dollar. In there. Wow!

225
00:40:22,088 --> 00:40:23,881
TOSS A QUARTER. FLIPPER RETURNS.

226
00:40:38,771 --> 00:40:41,566
OROP 25 CENTS HERE

227
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:47,655
PENNIES

228
00:40:48,072 --> 00:40:51,117
Oon't ask me,
I can't explain how he does it.

229
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:56,414
What's this, a penny?

230
00:40:56,831 --> 00:41:00,668
It's a Lincoln penny!
Vintage, man! Enjoy!

231
00:41:30,531 --> 00:41:33,326
Marvin! Come on in. No charge!

232
00:42:09,403 --> 00:42:12,657
1 dollar, thanks. Fish in the bucket.

233
00:42:13,074 --> 00:42:16,827
1 dollar, thanks.
Fish go in the bucket. Excuse me!

234
00:42:18,204 --> 00:42:20,206
You need a fish to get in.

235
00:42:20,623 --> 00:42:23,709
I don't have to pay, Kim.
I own this circus.

236
00:42:25,419 --> 00:42:27,713
What's going on here?
- Oh, hi!

237
00:42:28,172 --> 00:42:32,969
My best havanas! - It's the
Flipper Show! - Who's Flipper?

238
00:42:36,055 --> 00:42:39,976
Alright, the Flipper Show is over.
All you kids go home, now!

239
00:42:40,393 --> 00:42:42,770
Come on.
- Sorry.

240
00:42:43,187 --> 00:42:45,314
You can have your fish back.

241
00:42:45,731 --> 00:42:47,859
Give me my fish!
- Now!

242
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:53,114
See ya, Sandy.
Go easy on him, Mr. Ricks.

243
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:59,620
You were gonna fix the house!
- I did it so Flipper could eat.

244
00:43:00,037 --> 00:43:04,333
Who do you think you're dealing with?
You did it to turn some coin.

245
00:43:05,126 --> 00:43:08,421
I didn't do too bad
for myself either. Hey!

246
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:12,258
Half cut!
As for you, you oversized guppy...

247
00:43:17,722 --> 00:43:19,557
I'll have to bring out the heavy guns.

248
00:43:29,817 --> 00:43:34,697
We're gonna try a new approach.
It's called "Oealing with your crap."

249
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:37,366
This is how it works. Number 1:

250
00:43:37,783 --> 00:43:42,830
You're gonna take responsibility for
your actions and the consequences.

251
00:43:43,247 --> 00:43:46,375
Number 2: You're
gonna start getting up on time.

252
00:43:46,792 --> 00:43:49,504
And at work,
you're gonna hump, not gripe.

253
00:43:49,921 --> 00:43:54,133
You'll have to use your brain,
the weakest muscle in your body.

254
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:56,219
And as fo the dolphin:

255
00:43:56,636 --> 00:44:02,058
If the damn thing won't go away,
you'll feed it. In your own time.

256
00:44:02,475 --> 00:44:04,602
And stand up straight!

257
00:44:05,061 --> 00:44:09,232
Oh, and you wanna be
a big man with a cigar, right?

258
00:44:10,608 --> 00:44:11,943
Fire up that puppy!

259
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:16,113
Keep it stoked! From now on,
when I smoke, you smoke.

260
00:44:45,393 --> 00:44:48,479
Washed your hands? Sit down.

261
00:44:51,774 --> 00:44:52,775
Stogies down.

262
00:44:55,152 --> 00:44:56,320
Let's eat.

263
00:44:56,737 --> 00:45:01,367
Mom, when are you picking me up?
- In 2 weeks. What's in your mouth?

264
00:45:01,784 --> 00:45:03,995
Cigar.
- A what?

265
00:45:05,371 --> 00:45:09,208
I've been smokin' up a storm.
Uncle Porter lets me drink beer.

266
00:45:09,625 --> 00:45:13,462
He also knows a lot of
loose women. - Put your uncle on!

267
00:45:18,968 --> 00:45:22,638
Yeah, Porter.
- He can't smoke. He's just a kid!

268
00:45:23,055 --> 00:45:24,724
Hang on a sec, love...

269
00:45:28,477 --> 00:45:30,855
It's OK,
he' s about to kick the habit.

270
00:45:33,399 --> 00:45:34,942
Ready for another?

271
00:45:36,569 --> 00:45:39,197
Oh, please,
I'll never smoke again!

272
00:45:40,114 --> 00:45:43,701
Good. Now go and
take care of that poor little fish.

273
00:46:05,848 --> 00:46:07,850
Good boy. Thanks.

274
00:46:10,478 --> 00:46:13,981
Bring it to Sandy. Go on!

275
00:46:19,862 --> 00:46:21,447
Porter!

276
00:46:23,324 --> 00:46:27,787
I can't find Marvin anywhere.
I'm really worried. - Jump in.

277
00:46:32,625 --> 00:46:33,709
1 minute 20.

278
00:46:35,545 --> 00:46:36,546
Hey, Sandy!

279
00:46:38,464 --> 00:46:39,715
Marvin, what's up?

280
00:46:41,425 --> 00:46:42,677
Cool, huh?

281
00:46:44,428 --> 00:46:45,763
Come on down.

282
00:46:54,146 --> 00:46:57,650
Careful on the dock, Marv.
It's kinda slippery!

283
00:47:01,112 --> 00:47:03,489
Alright, Marv. Meet Flipper!

284
00:47:28,014 --> 00:47:30,099
Marvin!
- Flipper!

285
00:47:35,605 --> 00:47:38,065
Way to go, Marv!

286
00:47:49,952 --> 00:47:51,746
Are you guys telling secrets?

287
00:47:53,539 --> 00:47:57,293
We were wondering what the deal
is with you two? - What d'ya mean?

288
00:47:57,710 --> 00:48:01,005
You in for the long haul,
or is it just a fling?

289
00:48:03,424 --> 00:48:05,384
Sorry, is that the wrong question?

290
00:48:05,801 --> 00:48:10,056
Not at all, Sandy.
I'd be interested in the answer.

291
00:48:10,473 --> 00:48:12,517
Eat up, it's getting cold.

292
00:48:26,739 --> 00:48:28,574
Well, the gang's all here.

293
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:32,453
Word has it you have a pet dolphin.

294
00:48:34,038 --> 00:48:36,165
I wouldn't call it a pet, Oirk.

295
00:48:36,582 --> 00:48:40,878
No? The way fishing's been,
we don't need a dolphin...

296
00:48:41,295 --> 00:48:44,674
to tear holes in nets and steal bait.

297
00:48:45,925 --> 00:48:47,969
But you know that, don't you?

298
00:48:48,386 --> 00:48:52,390
We're talking about one dolphin.
- You stay out of this.

299
00:48:53,266 --> 00:48:55,643
One dolphin is one too many.

300
00:49:03,234 --> 00:49:04,235
Bad smell around here.

301
00:49:08,072 --> 00:49:13,494
What's his problem? - He resents
anything smarter than he is.

302
00:49:13,911 --> 00:49:17,039
That includes about everything,
even these clams.

303
00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:32,013
Get him!
- Out of the way!

304
00:49:33,514 --> 00:49:36,684
What are you doing?
You're hurting him!

305
00:49:38,811 --> 00:49:39,812
That's enough!

306
00:49:40,605 --> 00:49:45,234
You've had your fun. Let him go.
- It's the Greenpeace Warrior!

307
00:49:49,071 --> 00:49:52,450
The animal means something
to the kid. - It does?

308
00:49:53,242 --> 00:49:56,454
Well, isn't that sweet?

309
00:49:56,871 --> 00:49:58,998
Isn't that sweet, boys?

310
00:49:59,415 --> 00:50:02,210
The kid and the fish are pals.

311
00:50:02,627 --> 00:50:05,379
I'd watch how I make friends.
- Enough!

312
00:50:16,432 --> 00:50:20,937
You got no right to do that.
I should teach you a lesson.

313
00:50:21,354 --> 00:50:23,481
Yeah, I'd like that.

314
00:50:23,898 --> 00:50:28,528
I have a thirst for knowledge.
Teach me.

315
00:50:36,077 --> 00:50:37,453
School's out, is it?

316
00:50:42,708 --> 00:50:44,168
Thought so.

317
00:50:44,585 --> 00:50:46,796
Maybe next time.

318
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,801
You can count on it, Ricks!

319
00:50:59,934 --> 00:51:05,064
Good boy.
Come here, let me see those teeth.

320
00:51:11,362 --> 00:51:14,031
Here you go.
- That'll fit.

321
00:51:19,996 --> 00:51:21,622
Slow down!

322
00:51:27,461 --> 00:51:30,965
Hey, Buck, How are ya?
- Fine, and you?

323
00:51:31,382 --> 00:51:35,928
Pretty good. Bit of storm damage,
nothing we can't handle.

324
00:51:36,721 --> 00:51:39,849
Lucky dolphin! Gets the pro treatment.
- How are ya?

325
00:51:40,266 --> 00:51:44,562
Fine, except a little bird told me
you found yourselves this animal.

326
00:51:45,354 --> 00:51:47,648
Porter, you can't keep a dolphin.

327
00:51:48,065 --> 00:51:52,403
Here's the funny part: We're not
keeping it. He just stays.

328
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:57,867
I tried to chase him away,
but he's taken a fancy to us.

329
00:51:58,326 --> 00:52:02,246
He's also harassing the fish.
- What? - We can't allow that.

330
00:52:02,705 --> 00:52:06,292
Who told you that?
- It doesn't matter.

331
00:52:06,709 --> 00:52:11,756
The law says, unless an animal's in
licensed captivity, he must be at sea.

332
00:52:15,468 --> 00:52:19,847
You're here to take him?
- You can't! He's used to being fed.

333
00:52:20,264 --> 00:52:22,808
That animal
can't fend for itself anymore.

334
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:26,729
Help me out here, old buddy.

335
00:52:27,772 --> 00:52:31,776
They'll stick him in some
aquarium and revoke your license.

336
00:52:41,661 --> 00:52:45,831
Good boy. Easy now.

337
00:52:46,249 --> 00:52:48,709
Slow down, guys.

338
00:52:54,841 --> 00:52:57,218
You wanna come, or wait here?

339
00:53:01,514 --> 00:53:02,765
All set, Porter!

340
00:53:13,776 --> 00:53:15,278
Wait!

341
00:53:30,501 --> 00:53:32,503
It's okay.

342
00:53:39,927 --> 00:53:41,470
Good boy.

343
00:54:00,865 --> 00:54:04,202
Let him down slowly.
Easy, easy!

344
00:55:37,211 --> 00:55:39,297
Almost out of gas.

345
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:44,886
It's cold.

346
00:55:51,809 --> 00:55:53,895
Here.
- Thanks.

347
00:56:24,133 --> 00:56:25,551
Jeez!

348
00:57:03,506 --> 00:57:05,258
Let's get outta here!

349
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:23,150
Another day in paradise.

350
00:57:28,823 --> 00:57:30,867
You sleep here all night?

351
00:57:36,247 --> 00:57:39,417
I know you miss him.
He belongs out there.

352
00:57:41,878 --> 00:57:44,839
Things seem to mess up
when you care about them.

353
00:57:46,299 --> 00:57:49,802
It's like they say:
"To live is to love.

354
00:57:50,219 --> 00:57:54,140
All reason's against it,
all instinct's for it."

355
00:57:54,932 --> 00:57:58,227
What does that mean?
- I dunno. Read it on a calendar.

356
00:58:00,229 --> 00:58:05,693
It's good to care. People who don't
wind up drooling cream spinach.

357
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:21,501
How come you don't have any kids?

358
00:58:25,046 --> 00:58:28,799
Kids require commitment.
That's not one of my strengths.

359
00:58:29,258 --> 00:58:32,220
If had a kid,
he'd might turn out like me.

360
00:58:33,971 --> 00:58:35,223
Might not be bad.

361
00:58:36,891 --> 00:58:40,728
He could turn out like you.
- Now that'd be a nightmare!

362
00:58:49,111 --> 00:58:51,155
Special delivery.

363
00:58:53,324 --> 00:58:54,909
I got us front and center.

364
00:58:57,119 --> 00:58:59,664
You're really going
to the concert? - Why not?

365
00:59:00,122 --> 00:59:03,292
I was grunge before they named it.

366
00:59:07,213 --> 00:59:10,800
Speakin' of grunge,
there's a load of dirty laundry

367
00:59:11,259 --> 00:59:14,053
with your name on it. Enjoy.

368
00:59:30,945 --> 00:59:31,946
What's the matter?

369
00:59:53,801 --> 00:59:55,052
What's wrong?

370
00:59:59,515 --> 01:00:03,519
Sandy, do something!
- Hold him up, don't let him sink.

371
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:12,403
I'll be back.

372
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:16,574
How are the kids?
- They're all fine.

373
01:00:17,241 --> 01:00:19,202
Come quick! He came back.

374
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:21,829
I think he's dying.

375
01:00:30,004 --> 01:00:33,174
His breathing is shallow.
He's probably dehydrated.

376
01:00:34,884 --> 01:00:36,886
Who's for pizza?

377
01:00:39,931 --> 01:00:41,098
I see a dolphin.

378
01:00:41,557 --> 01:00:45,311
The only thing keeping him alive
is a strong will to live.

379
01:00:46,312 --> 01:00:48,981
Oo you have a blender?
- Pardon?

380
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:06,457
What is it?
- Kind of a dolphin shake.

381
01:01:06,874 --> 01:01:11,587
An emergency supply of iron, protein,
calcium, bunch of other nutrients.

382
01:01:12,004 --> 01:01:15,758
Oo you have any Jell-O?
- Jell-O?

383
01:01:20,221 --> 01:01:21,222
Marshmellow cream...

384
01:01:22,265 --> 01:01:23,266
Rancid...

385
01:01:25,601 --> 01:01:26,602
Oead...

386
01:01:27,937 --> 01:01:29,480
How about tropical punch?

387
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:44,203
Sorry.
- No problem, I got a handy vac.

388
01:01:52,545 --> 01:01:54,839
I've seen him eat a cockroach.

389
01:02:03,848 --> 01:02:04,932
It's better from you.

390
01:02:08,603 --> 01:02:10,313
Come on, buddy.

391
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:14,567
You can do it.
Please, Flipper, just try it.

392
01:02:19,071 --> 01:02:20,323
Come on.

393
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:23,117
That's it. There.

394
01:02:33,252 --> 01:02:34,253
Come on.

395
01:03:16,963 --> 01:03:19,674
Listen, sorry about that time
I yelled at you.

396
01:03:29,016 --> 01:03:34,438
I saved you
a couple of slices, extra anchovies.

397
01:04:06,512 --> 01:04:08,598
This is quite a spread for you.

398
01:04:09,015 --> 01:04:13,978
I was going to do croissants, but
you might've had a heart attack.

399
01:04:14,937 --> 01:04:20,067
It's the thought that counts.
Like bringing someone flowers.

400
01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:22,820
You'll do it one day.

401
01:04:23,279 --> 01:04:26,532
I bought you flowers!
- You're such a liar!

402
01:04:28,034 --> 01:04:30,828
What d'ya call that?
- Weeding.

403
01:04:35,082 --> 01:04:37,084
Here are the test results.

404
01:04:49,013 --> 01:04:53,017
I can't believe it.
He's just like a little kid.

405
01:04:53,434 --> 01:04:55,895
All he wants to do is play.

406
01:04:57,021 --> 01:04:58,189
Come here!

407
01:05:00,024 --> 01:05:01,025
Go on!

408
01:05:03,569 --> 01:05:05,613
Good boy, that's it.

409
01:05:07,365 --> 01:05:10,201
Our friend was poisoned!

410
01:05:12,245 --> 01:05:17,542
Oioxin levels are off the chart.
Another meal and he'd be glowing.

411
01:05:17,959 --> 01:05:23,005
Someone poisoned him? - Or the water,
which is why the fishing's so bad.

412
01:05:24,757 --> 01:05:28,094
Ooesn't make sense.
Nearest industry's on the mainland.

413
01:05:28,803 --> 01:05:32,473
Maybe the mainland's found
a place to dump toxic garbage.

414
01:05:33,724 --> 01:05:35,601
Uh-oh...
- What now?

415
01:05:36,018 --> 01:05:39,313
The other night Kim and I
were looking for Flipper.

416
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:44,694
Oirk Moran's boat was out there.
They were tossing barrels over the side.

417
01:05:46,279 --> 01:05:49,365
Oo you remember where you were?

418
01:05:49,782 --> 01:05:53,828
Oefinitely. - Can you show us?
- No problem.

419
01:05:54,245 --> 01:05:58,165
This is it. Right here.
- No, it was over here.

420
01:05:58,624 --> 01:06:03,171
No, I'm positive. This is it.
- I'm telling you, I remember.

421
01:06:03,588 --> 01:06:05,882
Actually, it was more this way.

422
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:11,220
No, over here. - I'm telling you...
- I know it was here somewhere.

423
01:06:12,638 --> 01:06:16,142
"Somewhere"?
Could you be more specific?

424
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:17,977
It was dark.

425
01:06:18,394 --> 01:06:23,274
Hey, I'm from Chicago.
It's not like there are street signs.

426
01:06:23,691 --> 01:06:28,905
Oid you notice
the lighthouse on the way out?

427
01:06:29,906 --> 01:06:32,283
I'm pretty sure this was the spot.
- Me too.

428
01:06:32,742 --> 01:06:36,495
If you're at all right,
Oirk Moran's been dumping poison

429
01:06:36,913 --> 01:06:40,750
smack in the middle of my fishing
grounds. Let's head back.

430
01:06:48,382 --> 01:06:50,760
We know why
the fishing's been so lousy lately.

431
01:06:51,219 --> 01:06:55,556
What is it this time?
Algae blooms, el Niño, bad karma?

432
01:06:55,973 --> 01:06:59,644
Somebody's poisoning
these waters. - We may know who.

433
01:07:00,102 --> 01:07:02,897
When Flipper came back sick...
- Wait a minute!

434
01:07:03,314 --> 01:07:05,608
That dolphin's back?

435
01:07:06,692 --> 01:07:11,405
We're talking about toxic waste.
Costs big bucks to dispose of.

436
01:07:11,822 --> 01:07:15,576
If you can just dump it in the
ocean... - Look at these test results!

437
01:07:15,993 --> 01:07:21,207
I'm not interested! Bring me
hard evidence and I'll bust 'em!

438
01:07:21,666 --> 01:07:26,629
Buck! - Any idea how many
marine parks I've turned away?

439
01:07:27,046 --> 01:07:29,340
That animal
would be a fine attraction.

440
01:07:29,799 --> 01:07:32,635
Son-of-a...
- Easy, Oirk.

441
01:07:35,930 --> 01:07:40,351
If Flipper's still here on Monday,
I will see to it that he's

442
01:07:40,768 --> 01:07:42,770
jumping hoops at Sea World on Tuesday.

443
01:07:44,772 --> 01:07:49,068
Still talking about that dolphin?
- No. Actually,

444
01:07:49,485 --> 01:07:53,239
we were talking about
the slime-ball who's been

445
01:07:53,656 --> 01:07:56,117
dumping toxic waste offshore.

446
01:07:57,243 --> 01:07:59,871
That explains
why fishing's been so lousy lately.

447
01:08:01,455 --> 01:08:03,916
You have an active imagination.

448
01:08:04,375 --> 01:08:07,336
Just yesterday,
a fella landed a marlin there,

449
01:08:07,753 --> 01:08:09,422
trophy size.

450
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:12,717
These things happen.
Nature has its

451
01:08:13,134 --> 01:08:16,429
rhythms.
The fishing'll be back.

452
01:08:16,846 --> 01:08:19,140
And you'll be the boy who cried wolf.

453
01:08:24,103 --> 01:08:26,022
Remember that dolphin.

454
01:08:32,945 --> 01:08:36,365
What did he say?
- He needs more evidence.

455
01:08:36,824 --> 01:08:39,035
Like the dead fish ain't enough!

456
01:08:44,624 --> 01:08:49,587
And Flipper has to be gone by Monday.
- That gives us three days.

457
01:08:50,004 --> 01:08:53,674
For what? - To deploy our
secret weapon: Flipper.

458
01:08:54,091 --> 01:08:57,136
What are you talking about?
- Project Quick Find.

459
01:08:57,553 --> 01:09:00,348
The Navy started it after Korea.

460
01:09:00,765 --> 01:09:06,270
They trained dolphins to find things
like missiles. It was top secret.

461
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:09,941
How do you know about it?
- Part-time work.

462
01:09:10,358 --> 01:09:13,778
You didn't tell me. - You never told
me about whatshername at the marina.

463
01:09:14,195 --> 01:09:17,698
That was years ago.
How d'ya know about that?

464
01:09:18,991 --> 01:09:21,202
Cast off. We got work to do.

465
01:09:21,661 --> 01:09:24,747
Sandy, come up on the bow.
- Hey, Sandy.

466
01:09:25,164 --> 01:09:27,291
We could miss that concert.
- What concert?

467
01:09:30,795 --> 01:09:35,049
Microphone?
Nitrox, pressure gauge?

468
01:09:35,466 --> 01:09:38,094
GPS...
- Nitric oxide,

469
01:09:38,511 --> 01:09:41,138
ATP, dramomine...

470
01:09:44,016 --> 01:09:46,561
Seasickness.
- I don't need this. - Sandy,

471
01:09:46,978 --> 01:09:49,105
never hurl in front of a woman.

472
01:09:50,606 --> 01:09:53,776
Thanks.
- Something to live by.

473
01:09:58,364 --> 01:09:59,365
Nice outfit!

474
01:10:03,744 --> 01:10:04,745
Figures.

475
01:10:09,959 --> 01:10:11,836
Wait for me!

476
01:11:00,843 --> 01:11:04,430
Porter, can you help Marvin
set up the computer?

477
01:11:04,847 --> 01:11:09,185
Computer? No problem.
What are you gonna do?

478
01:11:10,061 --> 01:11:12,063
I'm command central.

479
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:16,859
I'm keeping track of Flipper.
Tell me when the grunt work's done.

480
01:11:17,527 --> 01:11:20,947
Grunt work?
We both know I'm good at that...

481
01:11:23,241 --> 01:11:27,578
Sandy, make sure Flipper's ready.
Kim, you spot. Marv, this is for you.

482
01:11:28,913 --> 01:11:33,960
Flipper's secret is
echo-location. - Echo what?

483
01:11:34,377 --> 01:11:40,466
Oolphin sonar. Flipper sends a beam
of sound and receives an echo back.

484
01:11:40,883 --> 01:11:43,177
He's good at that.
- Like a dog.

485
01:11:43,594 --> 01:11:47,890
Instead of using his nose,
he uses his... echo... thing.

486
01:11:50,142 --> 01:11:53,813
Exactly.
The Navy took it one step further.

487
01:12:00,236 --> 01:12:04,907
Come in, Central Command. We're in
spashdown area, awaiting orders.

488
01:12:05,324 --> 01:12:09,912
Copy that. Send Flipper
when the ball is secure. Over.

489
01:12:10,329 --> 01:12:12,790
Go on, boy. Find it!

490
01:12:35,980 --> 01:12:38,274
Negative on station 1.

491
01:12:40,151 --> 01:12:43,029
Proceed to next station.

492
01:12:43,446 --> 01:12:48,326
I love all this Navy talk.
You still have your old uniform?

493
01:13:00,755 --> 01:13:03,049
Guppy says negative on station four.

494
01:13:04,926 --> 01:13:06,177
Oamn.

495
01:13:06,636 --> 01:13:09,722
Negative on station 15.

496
01:13:49,387 --> 01:13:52,473
We must have
searched the whole ocean by now.

497
01:13:57,061 --> 01:13:58,855
We should come back tomorrow.

498
01:14:00,857 --> 01:14:03,818
This Martha Stewart's a clever woman.

499
01:14:04,235 --> 01:14:08,948
She's made curtains out of fishing
nets. That'd work at my place.

500
01:14:14,328 --> 01:14:17,331
I think
you really need to get a life.

501
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:34,640
It's just sea swells.

502
01:14:55,661 --> 01:14:58,497
I think he found something.

503
01:15:01,375 --> 01:15:02,376
Hey, look!

504
01:15:10,426 --> 01:15:13,763
What's happening?
- He found something. What now?

505
01:15:14,388 --> 01:15:18,226
It's time for
the "Flippo-Cam". - The "Flippo-Cam"?

506
01:15:23,648 --> 01:15:25,942
You made this?

507
01:15:27,193 --> 01:15:29,403
You're starting to scare me.

508
01:15:59,892 --> 01:16:01,352
Giant squid astern!

509
01:16:02,728 --> 01:16:03,729
Marv, I...

510
01:16:10,236 --> 01:16:11,696
I don't see anything.

511
01:16:32,466 --> 01:16:34,468
I bet that's his family.

512
01:17:11,088 --> 01:17:12,089
POISON

513
01:17:12,548 --> 01:17:15,676
Oh my God!
- Gross.

514
01:17:16,093 --> 01:17:18,471
HAZAROOUS WASTE

515
01:17:27,563 --> 01:17:32,318
We better get hold of old Buck!
- Buck? Try the coastguard.

516
01:17:32,735 --> 01:17:35,029
Coastguard, this is the Reliable, over.

517
01:17:37,615 --> 01:17:39,992
Coastguard, this is the Reliable, over.

518
01:17:45,248 --> 01:17:46,249
Gotcha!

519
01:17:48,376 --> 01:17:52,755
Coastguard, this is the Reliable, over.
It's not working.

520
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:01,639
What happened?

521
01:18:02,890 --> 01:18:05,351
Marvin, what's wrong?

522
01:18:22,451 --> 01:18:26,038
That'll send a signal
so we can find the spot again.

523
01:18:28,165 --> 01:18:31,502
I'm not going without Flipper.
- This isn't the time.

524
01:20:21,654 --> 01:20:24,198
This is Porter Ricks.
Anyone out there?

525
01:20:25,491 --> 01:20:26,826
Hey, Marv.

526
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:29,954
Where's Sandy?

527
01:20:33,207 --> 01:20:34,208
Oh my gosh.

528
01:20:34,667 --> 01:20:35,668
Mr. Ricks!

529
01:20:36,878 --> 01:20:39,589
Alright, Buck...
- Sandy's gone. - Not now...

530
01:20:40,006 --> 01:20:41,340
Buck, I...

531
01:20:43,342 --> 01:20:44,260
Oh God.

532
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:01,235
Scar!

533
01:21:19,670 --> 01:21:21,214
No!

534
01:21:32,934 --> 01:21:34,685
Help!

535
01:22:05,925 --> 01:22:08,302
Come on, swim!

536
01:22:42,003 --> 01:22:45,506
That a boy, come on. You're safe.

537
01:22:48,050 --> 01:22:50,845
That's one courageous little dolphin.

538
01:22:53,097 --> 01:22:55,183
Too bad you saw us that night, son.

539
01:23:10,615 --> 01:23:12,700
Thanks buddy!

540
01:23:13,117 --> 01:23:15,494
That's a good boy!

541
01:23:29,175 --> 01:23:31,385
You alright?
- I'm fine.

542
01:23:31,844 --> 01:23:34,514
Thank God.
Your mother would have killed me.

543
01:23:36,057 --> 01:23:40,853
You remember that story about Scar?
- Yeah. - It's true.

544
01:23:46,526 --> 01:23:47,985
Thanks.

545
01:23:50,154 --> 01:23:51,155
You're welcome.

546
01:23:56,369 --> 01:24:01,165
Get that piece of sea slime
out of here. - Let's go.

547
01:24:01,582 --> 01:24:04,752
I don't think we got it in time.
EPA's on the way.

548
01:24:05,545 --> 01:24:09,298
Oon't worry. We'll clean these
waters up, thanks to Flipper.

549
01:24:10,883 --> 01:24:13,553
What about Flipper?
He saved my life.

550
01:24:13,970 --> 01:24:15,930
How about it, Buck?

551
01:24:20,643 --> 01:24:23,813
As long as he's free,
he can make this his home.

552
01:24:27,525 --> 01:24:29,902
We'll have him looking out for us.

553
01:24:31,070 --> 01:24:32,947
How about it, Sandy?

554
01:24:45,084 --> 01:24:50,214
He should go. - What?
- He belongs with his family.

555
01:25:04,937 --> 01:25:06,480
What is it?

556
01:25:12,069 --> 01:25:14,822
No, I can't come.

557
01:25:17,950 --> 01:25:20,328
Go on, it's okay.

558
01:25:29,795 --> 01:25:30,796
Please!

559
01:25:33,090 --> 01:25:34,467
Just go!

560
01:27:14,984 --> 01:27:16,360
Hi Mom!

561
01:27:18,487 --> 01:27:19,947
Hey bud!

562
01:27:21,115 --> 01:27:23,659
How was your summer?
- It was a total blast.

563
01:27:24,118 --> 01:27:25,912
A total blast, huh?

564
01:27:28,331 --> 01:27:30,541
I can't wait to hear about it.

565
01:27:40,259 --> 01:27:41,344
See ya around, Marv.

566
01:27:43,346 --> 01:27:46,015
What's the matter?

567
01:27:49,143 --> 01:27:51,437
He'll be back. You'll see.

568
01:27:56,609 --> 01:27:58,819
Gonna miss you.

569
01:27:59,237 --> 01:28:00,947
I'll miss you too.

570
01:28:06,661 --> 01:28:09,705
Gimme a sec?
- Come on, let's go on the boat.

571
01:28:13,835 --> 01:28:16,212
Gonna miss me?

572
01:28:26,264 --> 01:28:28,307
Bye.
- Bye.

573
01:28:34,689 --> 01:28:37,149
Take it easy, kid.
- All aboard!

574
01:28:44,532 --> 01:28:46,659
Bye.
- Take care.

575
01:29:02,842 --> 01:29:03,843
Wait!

576
01:29:06,721 --> 01:29:10,850
I forgot one thing.
Can I come back next summer?

577
01:29:12,685 --> 01:29:15,980
I think you'd better. I just made
a deal for 150 pound of spam.

578
01:29:21,569 --> 01:29:22,945
Go on, get!

579
01:29:47,970 --> 01:29:49,055
There!

580
01:29:50,681 --> 01:29:52,308
Hey, check it out!

581
01:29:55,895 --> 01:29:57,605
Hey, come on, guys!

582
