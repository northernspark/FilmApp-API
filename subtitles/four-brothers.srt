2
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,434
Okay, Darnell,

3
00:00:58,538 --> 00:01:01,562
so the candy just happened
to jump into your pocket, huh?

4
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,752
I don't think so.
Samir's gonna call the police now.

5
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,150
- But I...
- Samir, the police.

6
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,738
- Hello, police?
- Please don't call the police. Please.

7
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,240
I'll hold.

8
00:01:14,179 --> 00:01:17,098
That's what happens when you
shoplift, there's consequences.

9
00:01:17,307 --> 00:01:20,122
But it's just some damn candy.
I don't wanna go to jail.

10
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:23,146
Well, you can probably get away
with stealing sometimes, Darnell,

11
00:01:23,355 --> 00:01:25,649
but, you know, sooner or later
you're gonna get caught.

12
00:01:25,851 --> 00:01:28,360
Is that the way you wanna
lead your life, huh?

13
00:01:28,568 --> 00:01:30,758
- No.
- I happen to believe

14
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:33,260
that you're worth more.

15
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:35,659
But you gotta believe it, Darnell.

16
00:01:36,076 --> 00:01:39,308
- I hear you, Miss Evelyn.
- Are you bullshitting me?

17
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:43,479
- No, ma'am.
- Well, you better not be, you hear me?

18
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,251
Yes, ma'am.

19
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,650
Okay. Now you tell Samir.

20
00:01:49,005 --> 00:01:51,612
I won't steal anymore, sir.

21
00:01:55,053 --> 00:01:56,617
It's all right.

22
00:01:57,138 --> 00:01:59,015
Boy, did you get lucky.

23
00:01:59,224 --> 00:02:01,101
Now I want you to go straight home,
you hear me?

24
00:02:01,309 --> 00:02:02,352
- Yes.
- You shouldn't be out

25
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,750
at this time of the night anyway.
Go on, get.

26
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,731
Thank you, Miss Evelyn.

27
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:14,656
You handled that just beautifully.

28
00:02:14,864 --> 00:02:19,348
You know, he's a good kid.
He just needs an older brother.

29
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:22,685
So let's take a look
at these Thanksgiving birds.

30
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:26,960
Oh, nice. Nice and plump.

31
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,652
Yo, Osama! Osama!
Get behind the register! Now!

32
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:33,633
- Did you hear what he said?
- Move! Move!

33
00:02:33,842 --> 00:02:36,031
- Please! Take it. Please.
- Shut up, man. Come on.

34
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,595
- I want no trouble.
- Shut the fuck up.

35
00:02:37,804 --> 00:02:38,847
- Take it all.
- Shut up!

36
00:02:39,055 --> 00:02:40,828
- I just came to the country.
- Don't you move.

37
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:43,643
- Do not move!
- I want no trouble, sir. Take it all.

38
00:02:43,852 --> 00:02:46,354
This is America, homeboy. Black
people don't get what they want

39
00:02:46,563 --> 00:02:48,335
- in this country. Why should you?
- Please!

40
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:04,289
Move, move, move, move!

41
00:03:04,497 --> 00:03:06,061
Come on. Let's go!

42
00:05:28,913 --> 00:05:31,936
Been a long time since anybody seen
that face around here.

43
00:05:32,145 --> 00:05:34,960
Must've gotten off for good behavior.

44
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,235
Not likely.

45
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:45,596
That's Bobby Mercer.

46
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:47,890
Heavyweight champion fuck-up
of the family.

47
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,914
And that's a well-defended title.

48
00:05:51,122 --> 00:05:54,250
Would've made his daddy proud
if he had ever had one.

49
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:57,066
I used to know him a little.
Played hockey with the boy.

50
00:05:57,587 --> 00:05:59,255
Got thrown out of 60-odd games

51
00:05:59,464 --> 00:06:01,862
before the league
had finally had enough of him.

52
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,573
They called him
the Michigan Mauler.

53
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:09,370
- Who's the kid?
- Oh, that's Jack. He's the youngest.

54
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:12,811
First-class fuck-up,
third-class rock star.

55
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:16,252
- He doesn't look like trouble.
- He's a Mercer.

56
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,441
Don't let him fool you.

57
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:20,527
Hey.

58
00:06:20,735 --> 00:06:22,299
You all right?

59
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:24,593
You sure?

60
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,096
You know I love you, man.

61
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,537
Come on, let's go see Jerry.

62
00:06:30,745 --> 00:06:34,395
- What do we got over here?
- Another model citizen, I'm sure.

63
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:36,480
My mom, she used
to talk about y'all all the time,

64
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:38,878
about how y'all used
to cut up at work.

65
00:06:39,087 --> 00:06:41,798
- No, actually Jeremiah's all right.
- She told me everything.

66
00:06:42,007 --> 00:06:44,718
You know, he was a rising star
in the union for a while.

67
00:06:45,135 --> 00:06:46,699
Man found a cause.

68
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,054
- How you doing, baby?
- Cool.

69
00:06:48,263 --> 00:06:49,618
Nice house, man. Not bad at all.

70
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:52,955
What's up, kiddo?
Come on, man. Give me a hug, man.

71
00:06:53,164 --> 00:06:55,562
We got one MIA.
I thought you said there were four.

72
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,334
Angel?

73
00:06:58,169 --> 00:06:59,628
Pretty boy.

74
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:01,609
Ex-hustler.

75
00:07:01,818 --> 00:07:03,382
Soldier.

76
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:06,093
Guess he's a no-show today.

77
00:07:06,302 --> 00:07:08,179
Do you remember
when I built that tree house

78
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:10,160
- and you burned the shit down?
- Come on, man.

79
00:07:10,368 --> 00:07:13,079
- Boy, I wanted to kick your ass, man.
- Don't worry, your house is brick.

80
00:07:13,288 --> 00:07:15,686
- I ain't gonna burn it down.
- Well, now, yeah.

81
00:07:15,895 --> 00:07:17,459
Oh, yeah, yeah.
No smoking in my house,

82
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:20,483
so you're gonna have
to put that out. Sorry.

83
00:07:21,004 --> 00:07:22,464
I don't get it.

84
00:07:22,672 --> 00:07:24,966
If this woman's such
a goddamn saint,

85
00:07:25,175 --> 00:07:27,990
how did she end up raising
four total fuck-ups?

86
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,327
Ms. Evelyn cycled hundreds
of kids out of the foster-care system

87
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:33,412
and into permanent homes.

88
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:37,687
And in 30 years,
she only came across four lost causes.

89
00:07:37,896 --> 00:07:39,251
Four delinquents so far gone,

90
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,650
she couldn't find anyone
to take them in.

91
00:07:41,858 --> 00:07:43,526
So she did.

92
00:07:43,735 --> 00:07:45,090
Trust me, Fowler,

93
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:49,470
these kids are congressmen compared
to what they would've been.

94
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:54,162
- Hey there. You must be Daniela.
- Look how big you guys are.

95
00:07:54,371 --> 00:07:56,352
And you must be Amelia.

96
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,959
Nice dress, Amelia.

97
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:01,982
- I'm Amelia.
- I know.

98
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:05,006
You guys probably don't remember us,
but I'm your Uncle Bobby

99
00:08:05,215 --> 00:08:06,257
and this is Cracker Jack.

100
00:08:06,466 --> 00:08:07,509
Don't teach them that, man.

101
00:08:08,343 --> 00:08:11,680
- You're not my uncle. You're white.
- Grandma Evey's white.

102
00:08:11,888 --> 00:08:13,661
Yeah, see,
we're a different kind of uncle.

103
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:15,538
Your grandma,
she adopted me and Uncle Jack,

104
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:17,206
like she did your daddy.

105
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,500
You're a policeman!

106
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,524
That's right, and you're all under
arrest, so don't nobody move.

107
00:08:23,984 --> 00:08:25,443
Hey, where y'all going?

108
00:08:25,652 --> 00:08:27,842
What about me, Green?
You gonna arrest me too?

109
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,387
All depends, Bobby.
You keeping straight?

110
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:33,055
Straight-ish.

111
00:08:33,264 --> 00:08:36,392
- How you doing, man?
- Good to see you.

112
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,686
- Jack.
- Green.

113
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:42,022
Sorry about your mom, brother.
Give me some love.

114
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:44,942
Jerry.

115
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:48,279
I thought you said
he wasn't coming.

116
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:51,198
No, I said I didn't know
if he was coming or not.

117
00:08:51,407 --> 00:08:54,743
I ain't seen him in
Lord knows how many years.

118
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:57,559
You know it's hard
to track that Bobby down.

119
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:02,042
Don't give me that look, Camille.

120
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:04,962
I am way through with that life.

121
00:09:05,171 --> 00:09:07,569
Thanks for coming, Green.
Mom would've been happy you made it.

122
00:09:07,777 --> 00:09:11,427
Shit, your mom would've been happy
you made it back for her funeral.

123
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:14,138
I didn't come back for no funeral.

124
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:19,143
Thanks for the offer,
but we got it under control.

125
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:21,958
Yeah. You know, I could tell by
the looks of things when I drove in.

126
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:24,878
The place looks completely different.
Detroit's finest cleaned it up, huh?

127
00:09:25,086 --> 00:09:28,110
Yeah, be easy, Bobby.
We got these punks.

128
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,987
Kid playing basketball
across the street

129
00:09:30,196 --> 00:09:32,802
witnessed two gangbangers running in
there, shooting up the place...

130
00:09:33,011 --> 00:09:35,305
Come on, Green. I used to make
a good living around here

131
00:09:35,513 --> 00:09:38,642
because cops like you guys
couldn't find tits in a strip joint.

132
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:39,788
Why don't you come inside,

133
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,353
have some coffee
and some doughnuts

134
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:45,315
and then take your boy and get
the fuck out of here, okay? Come on.

135
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:51,154
Charming guy.

136
00:10:07,212 --> 00:10:09,193
Nice to be home.

137
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,174
So, shit, Bobby,
what've you been up to?

138
00:10:11,383 --> 00:10:14,198
I'm a freaking college professor, Jack.
What do you think I've been doing?

139
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,700
- I doubt that.
- Same old Bobby.

140
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:20,037
What about you? You still sucking
a little cock left and right, or what?

141
00:10:20,246 --> 00:10:21,810
Fucker.

142
00:10:23,374 --> 00:10:25,668
Y'all ain't right leaving me
out here in the cold like this.

143
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:28,170
- Yo, little brother! You asshole!
- You ought to be ashamed!

144
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:29,734
- I missed my plane.
- Get over here.

145
00:10:29,943 --> 00:10:32,133
You missed our mother's
funeral too, jarhead.

146
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:33,905
- What's up?
- What's up with you?

147
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:37,346
- What's up, boy?
- It's all good, man.

148
00:10:37,555 --> 00:10:40,891
- You shaved off the Afro, huh?
- Jack!

149
00:10:41,621 --> 00:10:44,019
- Haven't seen you in forever.
- Yeah, I know.

150
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:48,399
- Did you get your teeth whitened?
- Man, shut up, Jackie-poo.

151
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,480
I'm gonna get me something to eat.

152
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:12,590
- All y'all hungry?
- No, I'm gonna get some sleep.

153
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:15,926
Jack, you take your old room, all right?
Angel, take yours.

154
00:11:16,135 --> 00:11:18,220
I'm gonna sleep in Mom's room.

155
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:04,160
You been crying in here,
you little fairy?

156
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:10,520
Leave it alone, man.

157
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,857
Still making a lot of racket
on that freaking thing?

158
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:18,757
Yeah, still making a lot of racket.

159
00:13:21,364 --> 00:13:24,492
- Too weird in Mom's room?
- Oh, man.

160
00:13:24,701 --> 00:13:26,786
Way too weird.

161
00:13:26,995 --> 00:13:28,455
It's crazy.

162
00:13:28,663 --> 00:13:30,123
I mean,
everything's exactly the same.

163
00:13:30,332 --> 00:13:32,834
She didn't change nothing
in this house.

164
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,489
- Look at y'all.
- What?

165
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:43,261
Nothing. I'm just happy
to see you, man.

166
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,929
Happy to see my brothers,
that's all.

167
00:13:45,764 --> 00:13:47,328
I'm happy to see you too, Jerry.

168
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:51,186
I guess I'll stop by the grocery store
and grab a turkey or something.

169
00:13:51,394 --> 00:13:53,375
Have a Thanksgiving dinner.

170
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:55,878
Let's at least act like
we're a real family.

171
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:58,172
Mom would like that.

172
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:04,115
Where you think you going?

173
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:09,433
It's a little heavy in there. I'm gonna
just go outside and get me a little air.

174
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:14,334
You're full of shit, man. You can smell
that ass from down the street, huh?

175
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:15,481
What are you talking about?

176
00:14:15,794 --> 00:14:17,566
What do you mean, what?
Come on, what, man.

177
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:20,069
You know exactly what we're talking
about with La Vida Loca.

178
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:22,363
Ain't nobody going
to get no La Vida Loca nothing.

179
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:24,240
- She got a boyfriend.
- She got a boyfriend.

180
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:26,429
She's got hard dick in her right now.

181
00:14:26,638 --> 00:14:29,245
She's screaming somebody else's
name, and the last thing she's doing

182
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:31,747
is thinking about your black ass.
Leave it alone, man.

183
00:14:31,956 --> 00:14:34,458
I can't even believe y'all coming at me
with this crazy junk, man.

184
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:36,335
- She's nothing but trouble.
- I'm standing here

185
00:14:36,544 --> 00:14:37,691
telling y'all both right now,

186
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:40,506
I'm not going to see that girl,
and I'm not!

187
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:45,407
- How serious are you with this dude?
- We're serious!

188
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:49,056
Oh, shit!

189
00:14:49,577 --> 00:14:52,080
Come on, in here.

190
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:56,981
Loco Ono is not staying
in this house!

191
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:58,440
- Bullshit, Bobby!
- I don't care!

192
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:00,839
La Vida Loca ain't staying
in this house one more night.

193
00:15:01,047 --> 00:15:02,611
- So get her stuff...
- So it's your house?

194
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,322
- This ain't no homeless shelter.
- You not running shit, Bobby!

195
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:06,782
- You not!
- Hey, Bobby.

196
00:15:08,972 --> 00:15:11,683
Baby, why don't you go back upstairs.
I've got this covered.

197
00:15:11,891 --> 00:15:13,455
- What's wrong with you?
- Go back upstairs!

198
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:15,124
Why do you let him talk
to me like that?

199
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:16,792
- Go upstairs!
- Was I speaking Spanish?

200
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:18,773
- Was I speaking Spanish?
- What's your problem?

201
00:15:18,982 --> 00:15:21,172
Can you stop talking
to my girl like that, man?

202
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,840
That's what
I'm talking about, Bobby.

203
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:25,655
She wasn't your girl as of yesterday,
man. She had another man.

204
00:15:25,864 --> 00:15:27,011
So I'm confused.

205
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:29,096
What are you talking about, man?

206
00:15:29,305 --> 00:15:30,660
- She is my girl!
- He's right!

207
00:15:30,869 --> 00:15:34,101
Let's just play some fucking
Turkey Cup, man. How about that?

208
00:15:38,793 --> 00:15:40,670
Don't start, man.

209
00:15:43,381 --> 00:15:45,988
- Why do you always do that?
- Shut up.

210
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:49,950
- To be aggravating.
- "To be aggravating."

211
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:52,244
Chill out, man.
I'm watching the game. Come on.

212
00:15:53,808 --> 00:15:55,477
- Why don't y'all hold that down?
- Yeah.

213
00:15:55,685 --> 00:15:57,145
Hold that down, man.

214
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:01,837
- You a woman.
- Get him, Jerry.

215
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:05,174
- Try it one more time.
- What you gonna do?

216
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:09,345
- You'll see.
- Big-ass teeth. Bite me?

217
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:12,681
You do got some
big-ass teeth, Jerry.

218
00:16:14,245 --> 00:16:15,810
Yeah.

219
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:18,833
All right.

220
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,066
- Yeah, get him, Jerry!
- What's up?

221
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:23,943
- What the hell you doing?
- Come on, boy.

222
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:27,696
The Gorgeous Black Ladies
of Wrestling, Nitro and Midnight.

223
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:30,616
Nitro got Midnight in a headlock.

224
00:16:30,825 --> 00:16:32,284
Get him! Get him, Jerry!

225
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:35,621
Midnight trying to get up,
but Nitro's on him!

226
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,436
- Get him, Nitro!
- Okay. All right, all right. All right.

227
00:16:38,645 --> 00:16:41,252
I'm still your big brother.

228
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:46,778
Come on, man, let's eat.
Bring out that bird.

229
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:53,034
Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior,
thank you for this day.

230
00:16:53,243 --> 00:16:54,911
Thank you for this food
we're about to receive

231
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,205
and thank you
for bringing us together. Amen.

232
00:16:57,414 --> 00:16:59,603
- Amen.
- Amen.

233
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:09,196
Pass me the salad, man.

234
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:38,809
Zip up your mouth, Jeremiah.

235
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:41,729
You grow up in a barn?

236
00:17:49,132 --> 00:17:50,279
Close your mouth, Angel.

237
00:17:52,469 --> 00:17:54,346
You think you a cow
or something?

238
00:17:58,204 --> 00:17:59,872
More tattoos, Angel?

239
00:18:01,332 --> 00:18:05,190
You don't have to hide them.
Look at mine.

240
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:12,176
But take your elbow off the table.

241
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:24,271
Jackie?

242
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:35,533
I know bad things happened to you
before you came to me.

243
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:37,514
Hey, look at me.

244
00:18:40,225 --> 00:18:42,832
But you're safe now.

245
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:04,103
To hell with this, man.

246
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,169
Let's go get a pickup game.

247
00:19:08,378 --> 00:19:10,359
I wanna see some quick sticks
and some tight passing.

248
00:19:10,568 --> 00:19:11,819
It's too cold, man.

249
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:14,530
I ain't come all the way back out here
to go play no hockey.

250
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:17,971
Come on, ladies, let's show
these guys some fucking skills!

251
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:23,706
Yeah! Come on. Bring it.

252
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:25,061
All right. Here it comes.

253
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:29,649
Pass me the puck, Bobby!

254
00:19:30,275 --> 00:19:31,839
Come on, man. Go.

255
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,341
- Y'all watch this.
- You got him.

256
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:38,721
Yeah! Black present.

257
00:19:39,242 --> 00:19:41,223
- There you go, yes!
- Nigga, please.

258
00:19:42,892 --> 00:19:43,830
Sorry about that.

259
00:19:47,792 --> 00:19:50,191
- Let me to talk to the girls.
- What are you doing? Give me that!

260
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,797
- Get your head out of your ass, Jerry!
- That's my phone, man!

261
00:19:53,006 --> 00:19:55,196
- Come on!
- Hit him hard.

262
00:19:55,404 --> 00:19:58,532
- That was weak.
- Get it, get it, get it.

263
00:19:58,741 --> 00:20:01,869
- Shut up, man.
- There you go!

264
00:20:02,077 --> 00:20:04,684
- Shit, I gotta make a man out of you.
- Damn it, Bobby.

265
00:20:04,893 --> 00:20:07,291
- Why you make them madder?
- Yeah.

266
00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:12,296
Gentlemen, I am truly sorry
about your mother.

267
00:20:12,505 --> 00:20:14,486
Although I only met Evelyn
the one time...

268
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:18,239
...she made quite an impression.

269
00:20:18,448 --> 00:20:22,306
I know it's difficult to deal
with mundane financial matters

270
00:20:22,515 --> 00:20:25,330
while your heart still grieves
for a loved one.

271
00:20:25,538 --> 00:20:27,624
How much do we get?

272
00:20:27,937 --> 00:20:29,814
Come on, man.

273
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:31,586
- Excuse me.
- Jack, what the...?

274
00:20:31,795 --> 00:20:33,359
Stupid-ass Jack,
what's wrong with you?

275
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:35,236
What was that?

276
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:40,449
This is the contents of your mother's
safety-deposit box.

277
00:20:40,658 --> 00:20:43,369
I'll leave you to look through it.

278
00:20:52,128 --> 00:20:54,213
Birth certificate.

279
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,341
The adoption papers.

280
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:00,365
Henry Ford Hospital.
So I am from Detroit.

281
00:21:01,095 --> 00:21:04,119
- Lansing, Michigan.
- My mom was 16?

282
00:21:04,327 --> 00:21:06,725
I got any papers in there?

283
00:21:07,143 --> 00:21:08,498
No.

284
00:21:08,707 --> 00:21:10,062
- I don't?
- No.

285
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:13,712
- You got any papers in there?
- No.

286
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,570
1969.

287
00:21:17,674 --> 00:21:21,011
- Mom went to Woodstock.
- You didn't know Mom was a hippie?

288
00:21:21,219 --> 00:21:22,887
Oh, here we go.

289
00:21:29,352 --> 00:21:33,002
- I ain't got no papers in there, man?
- There's some paper right there.

290
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:36,026
What about me?

291
00:21:36,234 --> 00:21:39,467
- That'll look good on you.
- Whatever, man.

292
00:21:41,135 --> 00:21:42,595
- You're fucking with me.
- Quit crying.

293
00:21:42,699 --> 00:21:44,159
Come on,
I got something to show y'all.

294
00:21:44,367 --> 00:21:46,661
- This is it.
- So this is your dream, Jerry?

295
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,955
- Oh, yeah.
- There's a lot of space in here.

296
00:21:49,164 --> 00:21:50,936
What are you gonna do,
build some automobiles?

297
00:21:51,145 --> 00:21:53,230
- No, luxury lofts.
- Rims, man.

298
00:21:53,439 --> 00:21:55,316
Urban sophistication
is what I'm talking about.

299
00:21:55,524 --> 00:21:58,235
- So now you're doing real estate?
- This whole first floor here

300
00:21:58,444 --> 00:22:01,468
is gonna be lavish offices
and storefronts.

301
00:22:01,676 --> 00:22:03,240
I'm gonna put
stained-glass windows here...

302
00:22:03,449 --> 00:22:05,534
The building is condemned.
You got insurance?

303
00:22:05,743 --> 00:22:07,203
- Why?
- So we can burn this bitch down.

304
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:10,331
No, we ain't burning shit down. You
always wanna destroy something.

305
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:13,042
- Look. Look at your little brother.
- Jack!

306
00:22:13,563 --> 00:22:15,336
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is this the master suite?

307
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:17,630
Am I making the property value
go down?

308
00:22:17,838 --> 00:22:19,715
This shithole gives the term
"Motor City Breakdown"

309
00:22:19,924 --> 00:22:21,592
a whole new meaning, Jerry.

310
00:22:21,801 --> 00:22:23,573
How the hell
you gonna pay for all this?

311
00:22:23,782 --> 00:22:28,370
Government redevelopment loan.
Easy to qualify. Low interest rates.

312
00:22:28,578 --> 00:22:32,540
Y'all stick around,
I might give y'all ass a job.

313
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:38,171
They look like nipples.

314
00:22:40,256 --> 00:22:42,238
Let's go get a real drink.

315
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,096
Your attention, please.
I wanna make a toast.

316
00:22:46,304 --> 00:22:47,660
To Evelyn Mercer.

317
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:51,726
The greatest mother
four degenerate bastards ever had.

318
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:57,670
Johnny, pour me
and my brothers another round.

319
00:22:57,878 --> 00:23:01,736
- And a warm milk for my sister here.
- Man, I will drink you under the table.

320
00:23:01,945 --> 00:23:04,135
We're not talking about sperm,
Jack, this is whiskey.

321
00:23:04,343 --> 00:23:06,533
Jack drinks Jack
Jack drinks Jack

322
00:23:06,741 --> 00:23:08,618
- That's your brother.
- Jack drinks Jack

323
00:23:08,827 --> 00:23:10,599
Jack licks ass crack and ball sack.

324
00:23:10,808 --> 00:23:13,415
Jack doesn't lick ass crack
and ball sack!

325
00:23:13,623 --> 00:23:16,960
Jack likes boobs. Jack gots fans.

326
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:19,775
Jack's got lots of fans.

327
00:23:19,984 --> 00:23:22,069
- Oh, man.
- Will you shut up, man?

328
00:23:22,278 --> 00:23:24,050
- I don't wanna go.
- Why are you in such a rush?

329
00:23:24,259 --> 00:23:26,240
You can't hang with your big brother
and have a drink?

330
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:29,577
- I'm here. I mean, what?
- I'm glad y'all here. I love y'all.

331
00:23:29,785 --> 00:23:33,122
Hey, that's real goddamn bad stuff
about your mom, fellas.

332
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:37,188
- Yeah.
- Freaking gangs. Worms.

333
00:23:37,397 --> 00:23:40,838
- Someone ought to step on them.
- Which gang, Johnny G?

334
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:43,862
Oh, shit. Here we go. I knew it.

335
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,217
I think I heard something.

336
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,762
The neighborhood's
really upset about this.

337
00:23:48,971 --> 00:23:51,265
Same old Bobby.

338
00:23:51,474 --> 00:23:52,620
Mama always said,

339
00:23:52,829 --> 00:23:56,374
"As bright as Bobby is,
he just does not like to think."

340
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:57,834
Ain't no good gonna come from this.

341
00:23:58,043 --> 00:24:00,337
- Let the police do their damn job.
- Stop with the police.

342
00:24:00,545 --> 00:24:01,901
Half the cops
in this town are crooked.

343
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:04,924
You think the other half give two shits
about another liquor-store holdup?

344
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:07,323
I'm telling you, man,
Green's on our side on this one.

345
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:09,200
- Come on, man.
- Green?

346
00:24:09,408 --> 00:24:11,911
She's the only woman
that ever gave a damn, man.

347
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:14,934
The least we can do
is go bang on a few doors

348
00:24:15,143 --> 00:24:17,124
and see what happens.

349
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:18,584
We owe her that much.

350
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:20,565
Why are you acting
like such a bitch, Jerry?

351
00:24:20,774 --> 00:24:23,380
Okay. So, what, y'all just gonna
shoot up the whole town

352
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:24,527
because y'all mad?

353
00:24:24,736 --> 00:24:26,300
- Why not?
- Come on, man!

354
00:24:26,509 --> 00:24:28,385
The people who did this,
they probably from the same

355
00:24:28,594 --> 00:24:30,784
shitty-ass streets we from.

356
00:24:30,992 --> 00:24:33,390
Mom would've been the first
to forgive them. Y'all know that.

357
00:24:33,912 --> 00:24:37,144
- We can't all be saints, Jerry.
- Yeah, we can't all be saints, Jerry.

358
00:24:37,353 --> 00:24:41,732
All right. All right. Cool.

359
00:24:42,775 --> 00:24:45,903
- Bye, Jerry.
- Don't call me when y'all get shot up.

360
00:24:46,111 --> 00:24:47,780
This is Detroit,
in case y'all forgot.

361
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:50,491
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Johnny.

362
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:51,951
Come tell us what's going on, man.

363
00:24:54,662 --> 00:24:56,747
You wanna know what I heard?

364
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,292
- You got a burner?
- I flew in.

365
00:25:00,501 --> 00:25:04,567
Man, be careful with my baby.

366
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:06,861
- You like that?
- Got ammo?

367
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:10,719
Yeah. It's loaded, little brother.
Careful. Here, you carry the gas can.

368
00:25:10,928 --> 00:25:13,952
- We're gonna do that gas thing?
- Yeah, we're gonna do the gas thing.

369
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,663
The only thing that scares people
more than getting burned to death

370
00:25:16,871 --> 00:25:18,435
is people getting eaten alive.
Let's go.

371
00:25:18,644 --> 00:25:21,147
What do I...? What do I get?

372
00:25:21,251 --> 00:25:25,317
You coming with us? Here you go,
sweetheart. Poke them with that.

373
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:26,881
- Oh, thanks.
- You're welcome.

374
00:25:31,782 --> 00:25:33,972
Let's go. Five-0!
I wanna see some hands!

375
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,536
Five-0, man! Five-0!

376
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:38,038
It's the fucking police!

377
00:25:38,768 --> 00:25:39,811
Bitch, get off me.

378
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,792
Get out! I don't wanna see
any of you back!

379
00:25:42,001 --> 00:25:43,356
- What are you doing here?
- Hands!

380
00:25:43,565 --> 00:25:44,920
You got any drugs
or alcohol on you?

381
00:25:45,129 --> 00:25:46,797
We're gonna make
y'all take urine samples!

382
00:25:47,006 --> 00:25:49,195
Get out of here!
Get your little asses home now!

383
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:56,494
The popos is here! Y'all better run,
man, these white cops are crazy!

384
00:25:56,703 --> 00:25:58,580
They killed Cornbread.
He didn't do nothing.

385
00:25:58,788 --> 00:26:00,457
Everybody put
your fucking hands up!

386
00:26:00,665 --> 00:26:02,751
Detroit Police! I wanna see
your fucking hands in the air!

387
00:26:02,959 --> 00:26:05,149
- We got the building surrounded!
- Every last one of you!

388
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:06,504
Sit your motherfucking ass down!

389
00:26:06,713 --> 00:26:08,381
- Fuck you.
- Sit the fuck down.

390
00:26:08,486 --> 00:26:09,633
- Don't fucking move!
- Sit down!

391
00:26:09,841 --> 00:26:11,926
You. Over here.
Yeah, yeah, you.

392
00:26:12,135 --> 00:26:13,282
You the man, right?

393
00:26:13,491 --> 00:26:16,410
Sit down and shut the fuck up!
Give me the gas.

394
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:17,870
Yo, what the hell y'all want?

395
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:19,851
Y'all ain't no cops.
What the hell you doing here?

396
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,875
You're gonna wish I was the police
when I'm done with your ass.

397
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:24,230
No, no, no, no, no.

398
00:26:24,439 --> 00:26:26,420
This is not the talking part, okay?

399
00:26:26,524 --> 00:26:28,610
This is the listening part,
so shut your mouth.

400
00:26:29,027 --> 00:26:30,904
- Why are you standing up?
- You know who I am?

401
00:26:31,112 --> 00:26:32,364
- It's warm here.
- No?

402
00:26:32,572 --> 00:26:35,387
- Get your ass over there on the couch.
- You don't know why we're here?

403
00:26:37,786 --> 00:26:39,975
- Yo, what the fuck!
- Shut up.

404
00:26:40,184 --> 00:26:42,061
I know you're not gonna tell me
what I wanna know,

405
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:44,459
so I'm gonna light
your little bitch ass on fire.

406
00:26:46,336 --> 00:26:47,796
Then I'm gonna
watch you run around here

407
00:26:48,004 --> 00:26:50,924
like a chicken with his head cut off,
lighting all your little friends on fire.

408
00:26:51,132 --> 00:26:52,175
Is that what you want?

409
00:26:52,384 --> 00:26:54,886
Which one of your boys shot up
the liquor store on 104th Street?

410
00:26:56,242 --> 00:26:57,701
The police got witnesses, bra.

411
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:00,621
- Don't even hit us with no bullshit.
- Okay, tough guy. Hey!

412
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,081
Now is the talking part.

413
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:05,417
You better start saying what
the fuck I wanna hear. Speak.

414
00:27:05,626 --> 00:27:08,233
Man, that shit was counterfeit
as a motherfucker, man.

415
00:27:08,441 --> 00:27:11,569
Ain't nobody playing no basketball
when that shit went down, okay?

416
00:27:11,778 --> 00:27:13,238
Why you think cops
ain't arrest nobody?

417
00:27:14,802 --> 00:27:15,949
What the hell is he doing?

418
00:27:16,157 --> 00:27:18,660
How do you know nobody was playing
basketball if you weren't there?

419
00:27:18,868 --> 00:27:21,892
Because, bitch, police said those
people wasn't killed till 11:00.

420
00:27:22,101 --> 00:27:24,603
- So what?
- So they turn the court lights out at 10!

421
00:27:28,461 --> 00:27:31,589
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Now, where we going, man?

422
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:32,945
The fuck y'all taking me?

423
00:27:33,154 --> 00:27:35,969
You little bastards need
to stay in school.

424
00:27:36,386 --> 00:27:38,263
That's what you get
for calling my brother a bitch.

425
00:27:38,471 --> 00:27:41,078
I hope you all have
a very nice evening.

426
00:27:47,856 --> 00:27:49,733
It's 10:02, and these
fucking lights are still on.

427
00:27:49,941 --> 00:27:51,818
I know you know
who did this, homeboy.

428
00:27:52,027 --> 00:27:54,216
This is bullshit. Let's pop
this motherfucker right now.

429
00:27:54,425 --> 00:27:55,989
- Speak up on it, man.
- Bobby, take it easy.

430
00:27:56,197 --> 00:27:57,970
- Shut up, Jack. Come on.
- Look, what...?

431
00:27:58,179 --> 00:28:00,577
Yo, man, they gonna shut off!
They gonna shut off, man!

432
00:28:00,785 --> 00:28:02,662
Only lights that are going off
are yours. Let's go.

433
00:28:02,871 --> 00:28:04,435
Look, look, look. Look.

434
00:28:08,606 --> 00:28:10,483
You're fucking lucky.

435
00:28:11,421 --> 00:28:12,985
Told you.

436
00:28:13,194 --> 00:28:16,635
Man, y'all fools been played.
Get off of me, man!

437
00:28:16,843 --> 00:28:18,928
Y'all don't even know
who you messing with, man.

438
00:28:19,137 --> 00:28:21,327
Questioning me about the lights
being off and all that.

439
00:28:21,535 --> 00:28:24,559
Why don't you shut the fuck up, man?
You talk too much.

440
00:28:25,602 --> 00:28:28,938
Jack, it was a questionable kill.

441
00:28:29,147 --> 00:28:30,503
What makes you think that?

442
00:28:30,711 --> 00:28:32,692
Boy, it's sad,
you growing up without a father.

443
00:28:32,901 --> 00:28:34,361
Nobody taught you anything,
did they?

444
00:28:34,569 --> 00:28:37,593
I should've stayed around longer and
held your little hand, huh, sweetheart?

445
00:28:37,802 --> 00:28:38,740
Whatever, man.

446
00:28:38,948 --> 00:28:42,494
Look, sometimes pros will cover up
their shots with another crime.

447
00:28:42,702 --> 00:28:44,162
Like a burglary or something.

448
00:28:44,371 --> 00:28:47,290
Then pay a witness to throw
the cops on to the wrong suspect.

449
00:28:47,499 --> 00:28:49,376
You understand?

450
00:28:49,584 --> 00:28:51,252
Why would anybody wanna kill

451
00:28:51,461 --> 00:28:55,006
the sweetest woman
in the goddamn world?

452
00:28:56,257 --> 00:28:58,864
I don't know, Jackie. I don't know.

453
00:29:07,727 --> 00:29:09,813
All right, I'm here.

454
00:29:10,543 --> 00:29:12,419
- What?
- Last night we found out

455
00:29:12,628 --> 00:29:14,192
it wasn't random.

456
00:29:14,401 --> 00:29:17,320
The witness was paid, and the whole
gang story was some bullshit.

457
00:29:17,529 --> 00:29:18,571
Are you serious, man?

458
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,282
- Come on now.
- Yeah.

459
00:29:23,576 --> 00:29:24,828
Can I help you, gentlemen?

460
00:29:25,036 --> 00:29:28,269
Yeah, if we could just have
a moment of your time, sir.

461
00:29:28,477 --> 00:29:30,980
Evelyn Mercer was our mother.

462
00:29:32,127 --> 00:29:34,629
She was a good lady.

463
00:29:35,672 --> 00:29:37,757
I liked her very much.

464
00:29:38,904 --> 00:29:40,573
Let's come inside.

465
00:29:55,483 --> 00:29:57,673
This doesn't add up.

466
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:05,389
He's already got the money.

467
00:30:37,505 --> 00:30:39,694
Supposedly, a witness told police
this was a gang shooting.

468
00:30:39,903 --> 00:30:41,154
You know anything about that?

469
00:30:41,363 --> 00:30:43,761
The police talked
for a long time with one man.

470
00:30:43,969 --> 00:30:45,429
One man more than the others.

471
00:30:46,263 --> 00:30:48,244
Would you remember what
he looks like if you see him?

472
00:30:48,453 --> 00:30:51,164
He comes in for Gatorade
after the games.

473
00:30:51,373 --> 00:30:53,979
Big guy. Always wears sweats,
never a jacket.

474
00:30:54,188 --> 00:30:56,378
Even with snow or rain.

475
00:30:56,586 --> 00:30:58,254
He has a dog and a...

476
00:30:58,463 --> 00:31:01,070
- You know a:
- A fro?

477
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:04,094
Like an Afro? Like Ben Wallace,
the basketball player?

478
00:31:04,302 --> 00:31:06,700
Pistons. Yes, yes, Ben Wallace.

479
00:31:07,743 --> 00:31:08,890
Okay.

480
00:31:09,307 --> 00:31:12,852
- Is he on the courts a lot?
- On the courts or at the gym.

481
00:31:16,189 --> 00:31:18,483
That wasn't no gang shooting,
that was an execution.

482
00:31:18,692 --> 00:31:21,298
They set Mom up.
They set her up.

483
00:31:21,924 --> 00:31:23,592
Come on.

484
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,925
- You guys ready?
- What's the plan, Bobby?

485
00:31:44,134 --> 00:31:46,532
- We're winging it, Jerry.
- We always wing it.

486
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,513
We're gonna get killed.

487
00:31:48,722 --> 00:31:51,224
What you mean "we," white boy?

488
00:31:51,433 --> 00:31:53,101
You ready?

489
00:31:55,603 --> 00:31:57,480
Here we go.

490
00:31:57,689 --> 00:31:58,836
Excuse me.

491
00:32:01,234 --> 00:32:04,049
I'll handle it. I don't know what
the hell you think you're doing,

492
00:32:04,258 --> 00:32:06,031
but you better get
the hell out of here, friend.

493
00:32:06,239 --> 00:32:07,907
I'd love to, friend, but I can't.

494
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:12,078
Yeah! I got the rock now!
I got this motherfucker now!

495
00:32:12,287 --> 00:32:14,789
- What? What? I got the rock!
- What, bitch?

496
00:32:20,629 --> 00:32:23,131
No need to grab me.
This will only take a second.

497
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,008
Now shut up and listen!

498
00:32:25,216 --> 00:32:26,780
- Get off!
- Get off the floor!

499
00:32:26,989 --> 00:32:28,970
My name is Bobby Mercer.

500
00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:30,847
And some of you probably
knew my mother.

501
00:32:31,056 --> 00:32:32,515
And some of you probably know
she was shot

502
00:32:32,724 --> 00:32:34,288
about a week ago across the street.

503
00:32:34,809 --> 00:32:37,520
Sixty-two years old,
murdered in cold blood!

504
00:32:37,729 --> 00:32:40,649
- Think about it, Bobby, think. Think!
- I'm looking for the witness.

505
00:32:40,857 --> 00:32:42,630
I got this.

506
00:32:42,838 --> 00:32:46,696
Ballplayer. Big guy.
Supposedly never wears a coat.

507
00:32:47,218 --> 00:32:49,720
- Dog lover. Ring any bells?
- Damn.

508
00:32:50,346 --> 00:32:53,578
You tell me where I can find the guy
and you can finish your game.

509
00:32:54,934 --> 00:32:57,436
All we wanna do is talk to the guy.

510
00:32:57,645 --> 00:32:59,834
You can end this real quickly.

511
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:04,318
Hey! Hey, kid!
No running in the halls!

512
00:33:05,882 --> 00:33:06,925
Get off me, man!

513
00:33:07,133 --> 00:33:09,636
- Why you running?
- Get off me, man.

514
00:33:09,844 --> 00:33:11,826
- Man, I don't know nothing.
- Why don't you shut up?

515
00:33:12,034 --> 00:33:14,745
You got something
to tell me, youngster?

516
00:33:14,954 --> 00:33:18,186
- Back the fuck up!
- I'm looking for who killed my mother.

517
00:33:18,603 --> 00:33:22,357
You tell me where I can find this guy
and you can finish your game.

518
00:33:23,295 --> 00:33:24,547
Cracker Jack.

519
00:33:24,755 --> 00:33:27,988
I appreciate your help very much.
You've all been upstanding citizens.

520
00:33:29,656 --> 00:33:31,637
Enjoy the rest of your game.

521
00:33:31,846 --> 00:33:34,035
You crazy as hell.

522
00:33:34,974 --> 00:33:37,163
- What do we got here?
- Bobby, meet Keenon.

523
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:40,813
Keenon, this is Bobby.

524
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:44,671
Something tells me he was
on his way to deliver a warning.

525
00:33:44,879 --> 00:33:46,756
What's his name, Keenon?

526
00:33:47,903 --> 00:33:50,197
Damian. He's my brother.

527
00:33:50,614 --> 00:33:53,847
He's your brother?
No shit. These are my brothers.

528
00:33:56,349 --> 00:33:59,373
- No, dog. He's my real brother.
- Yeah, these are my real brothers.

529
00:33:59,477 --> 00:34:02,605
This is Angel, I'm Bobby.
This is Jack and Jeremiah.

530
00:34:02,814 --> 00:34:04,795
So, what about you and Damian?
You guys still close?

531
00:34:05,004 --> 00:34:07,193
- Does he live at home with you?
- Yeah.

532
00:34:07,402 --> 00:34:08,966
But I ain't telling you shit else.

533
00:34:09,175 --> 00:34:12,824
- Okay.
- I wouldn't sell out my brothers either.

534
00:34:15,014 --> 00:34:16,474
Just calm down, okay?

535
00:34:16,995 --> 00:34:18,767
Look, we just wanna talk to him.

536
00:34:18,976 --> 00:34:22,417
We wanna ask him a few questions.
Is he gonna cooperate?

537
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,545
- We got something.
- Address?

538
00:34:25,754 --> 00:34:27,422
He lives in the Gardens,
right over there.

539
00:34:27,631 --> 00:34:31,593
Enjoy the rest of the game, okay?
Don't worry about it.

540
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:35,659
These are nice grades.
Better stay in school.

541
00:34:36,806 --> 00:34:38,996
What is that? Aluminum?

542
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:41,707
Shit doesn't even spin.

543
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:44,001
Come on, man.

544
00:34:44,627 --> 00:34:46,399
I just don't get it.
Why would somebody hire

545
00:34:46,608 --> 00:34:49,736
a goddamn killer to shoot Mom?

546
00:34:49,944 --> 00:34:50,987
Here's an idea:

547
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:54,324
We'll wait for the shithead
to get back and we'll ask him.

548
00:34:55,158 --> 00:34:56,931
Well, y'all do what y'all gotta do.

549
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:59,016
I got gymnastics.
Come on, let me out.

550
00:35:01,623 --> 00:35:03,187
You got your leotard on, Jerry?

551
00:35:03,395 --> 00:35:06,002
Go to hell. Y'all know what I'm talking
about. I got a schedule to keep.

552
00:35:06,211 --> 00:35:08,088
Girls got gymnastics,
I gotta take them.

553
00:35:08,296 --> 00:35:10,799
Come on, let me out, man.

554
00:35:11,111 --> 00:35:13,823
You wanna take Cracker Jack
with you? He's very flexible.

555
00:35:14,031 --> 00:35:16,012
- Bobby, you're the one who took ballet.
- All right, Jerry.

556
00:35:16,221 --> 00:35:17,993
All right, man.

557
00:35:19,453 --> 00:35:24,041
I don't mind
If it rains or freezes

558
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:28,942
Long as I got
My plastic Jesus

559
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,340
- Riding on the dashboard
- I don't know how you did it

560
00:35:31,549 --> 00:35:33,530
for so many years.
Must have driven you crazy, Angel.

561
00:35:33,738 --> 00:35:36,866
You're on a ship for what, six months
at a time with nothing but dudes?

562
00:35:37,075 --> 00:35:42,288
It wasn't a ship. And the Marines
went coed. They got girls now.

563
00:35:42,497 --> 00:35:44,791
Yeah, I bet you them girls
look like dudes too, though.

564
00:35:46,042 --> 00:35:47,606
Not after six months they don't.

565
00:35:50,526 --> 00:35:54,280
Comes in colors
Pink and pleasant

566
00:35:54,488 --> 00:35:56,991
Glows in the dark...

567
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:58,555
Oh, that's him. It's him!

568
00:36:13,674 --> 00:36:16,698
Yo, Damian! You Damian?

569
00:36:18,366 --> 00:36:21,390
Why are you pulling out guns
and shit, dog?

570
00:36:22,537 --> 00:36:25,352
- Yo!
- Oh, fuck! Who are these guys, man?

571
00:36:26,708 --> 00:36:29,419
Jack, stay here.
Tell me where it stops.

572
00:36:33,694 --> 00:36:35,154
Come on!

573
00:36:35,362 --> 00:36:37,135
Four.

574
00:36:38,595 --> 00:36:39,533
Five.

575
00:36:41,931 --> 00:36:43,078
Six.

576
00:36:43,808 --> 00:36:45,477
Come on, come on. Shit!

577
00:36:48,813 --> 00:36:51,524
Six. It stopped.

578
00:36:51,941 --> 00:36:54,340
Come on, Angel, we got this clown!
Come on!

579
00:36:56,842 --> 00:36:59,240
Six! He stopped at six!

580
00:37:05,392 --> 00:37:06,539
Yo!

581
00:37:07,582 --> 00:37:09,459
Yo, Damian, I just wanna
ask you a few questions!

582
00:37:09,668 --> 00:37:11,336
I got something for your ass!

583
00:37:12,483 --> 00:37:14,047
Bite his ass, Chucky!

584
00:37:14,673 --> 00:37:15,611
Oh, shit!

585
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,886
Yo, don't shoot my dog, man!

586
00:37:20,095 --> 00:37:21,972
- They got him! That's right!
- Shit!

587
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,536
- Bite his ass!
- Angel! Angel!

588
00:37:30,209 --> 00:37:33,650
Get this fucking dog
off my leg! Shit!

589
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,569
There's a dog trying to eat me, man!
Help me, man.

590
00:37:36,778 --> 00:37:39,906
- Hold on!
- Bite his ass!

591
00:37:41,574 --> 00:37:44,494
- It's biting my legs off!
- Get up off my brother!

592
00:37:44,911 --> 00:37:47,831
Get up off my brother, little boy!
What you doing?

593
00:37:51,376 --> 00:37:52,627
Where you at, playboy?

594
00:37:52,836 --> 00:37:54,296
My eyes.
Give me something for my eyes!

595
00:37:54,504 --> 00:37:57,215
We just wanna talk!
Put that in your eyes.

596
00:37:57,424 --> 00:37:58,675
Talk, huh?

597
00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:03,054
- The window. The window.
- All right.

598
00:38:04,723 --> 00:38:05,765
- Shit!
- Y'all didn't know

599
00:38:05,974 --> 00:38:08,059
- who you was messing with!
- He'll try to come up like...

600
00:38:08,268 --> 00:38:09,519
Get him.

601
00:38:11,396 --> 00:38:12,647
Give me my gun! Give me my gun!

602
00:38:12,856 --> 00:38:14,524
- I ain't playing with this dude!
- Drop it!

603
00:38:14,733 --> 00:38:15,775
I just wanted to talk!

604
00:38:19,633 --> 00:38:21,093
You're going down now!

605
00:38:25,055 --> 00:38:26,724
- Think he dead?
- No, he ain't dead.

606
00:38:26,932 --> 00:38:29,226
He's just fucked up.
Let's go talk to him now.

607
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,876
Man, you must be freezing.

608
00:38:33,501 --> 00:38:36,525
You won't be needing
this no more, playboy.

609
00:38:41,635 --> 00:38:43,407
You know why we're here, Damian?

610
00:38:46,118 --> 00:38:47,682
Come on, man,
call me an ambulance.

611
00:38:47,891 --> 00:38:49,872
An ambulance?
What, for my dog bites?

612
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,521
I'm gonna be okay.
You give me a name, I'll call 911.

613
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:55,815
I wanna know who shot up
that liquor store now.

614
00:38:56,024 --> 00:38:58,631
- Man, I didn't shoot no one.
- Say what?

615
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:01,237
Speak up. Can't hear you, playboy.

616
00:39:01,446 --> 00:39:03,531
It's hard to hear you out here
with all this wind.

617
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,972
If we leave, ain't nobody else gonna
hear you out here either.

618
00:39:07,181 --> 00:39:08,745
They say it's gonna be a cold night.

619
00:39:08,953 --> 00:39:11,247
You ain't gonna make it far
with that leg.

620
00:39:11,456 --> 00:39:12,916
Look, man,

621
00:39:13,124 --> 00:39:16,044
these two fools
said they'd pay me a few dubs

622
00:39:16,252 --> 00:39:18,546
if I said I saw some gangsters
shoot up the place, all right?

623
00:39:18,755 --> 00:39:21,675
- But I didn't hurt no one!
- Well, turn into a fucking Fudgesicle.

624
00:39:21,883 --> 00:39:24,698
Hey, come on, man!
I can't say nothing!

625
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:28,348
Fair enough.
You're gonna die right here.

626
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:31,372
Yo, man, come on! Yo, man!

627
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,457
- I'm calling his bluff.
- Hey, come on!

628
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:35,334
- Call an ambulance!
- Think he gonna break?

629
00:39:35,543 --> 00:39:37,211
You see that sparerib
hanging out of his leg?

630
00:39:37,419 --> 00:39:38,879
It's just a matter of time.

631
00:39:39,088 --> 00:39:40,860
- You sure?
- You wanna put money on it?

632
00:39:41,069 --> 00:39:42,529
- Are you sure?
- Someone help me!

633
00:39:42,737 --> 00:39:44,927
- Turn around, dick lips!
- What the fuck you looking at?

634
00:39:45,136 --> 00:39:47,221
- I'll tell you where you can find him!
- Come on!

635
00:39:47,429 --> 00:39:48,994
Just call me an ambulance.

636
00:39:49,932 --> 00:39:52,330
- Give me a name.
- Where can we find him?

637
00:39:56,084 --> 00:39:57,648
Yeah.

638
00:40:01,715 --> 00:40:03,383
How are you guys tonight?

639
00:40:11,829 --> 00:40:14,540
Goatee. Goatee.
Look for the man with the goatee.

640
00:40:14,748 --> 00:40:16,938
- I can get you one bigger than that.
- How big?

641
00:40:18,606 --> 00:40:19,753
- There he is.
- Where?

642
00:40:19,962 --> 00:40:21,318
Right there.
The guy with the goatee.

643
00:40:21,526 --> 00:40:24,654
- I see. Put your fucking hand down.
- Check the cats at the door.

644
00:40:26,531 --> 00:40:28,199
I see him. I see him.
Come on. Let's get him.

645
00:40:29,138 --> 00:40:30,910
- Get down!
- Damn! Go, go, go!

646
00:40:31,432 --> 00:40:34,351
- Run, y'all!
- Move! Everybody move!

647
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,498
- Go, go.
- Clear the way.

648
00:40:35,707 --> 00:40:37,584
- Excuse me.
- Move!

649
00:40:37,792 --> 00:40:40,191
Come on! Come on!

650
00:40:40,399 --> 00:40:41,859
Go ahead, you fucking punks!

651
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,153
Get it, Jackie-o!

652
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,783
You go, girl!
Let's get these motherfuckers.

653
00:40:57,708 --> 00:41:00,106
- Where they at?
- Can't see shit!

654
00:41:02,609 --> 00:41:04,381
- Punch it, Bobby! Punch it!
- I got no traction!

655
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:07,405
I'm sliding all over the fucking street!

656
00:41:15,747 --> 00:41:17,207
Hold on!

657
00:41:18,667 --> 00:41:20,439
Shit!

658
00:41:20,648 --> 00:41:23,046
Shit! I scraped the whole side
of my fucking car!

659
00:41:23,254 --> 00:41:26,383
- Get these guys before you kill us!
- Sit back and put your seat belt on.

660
00:41:30,762 --> 00:41:33,682
- Watch the snow, man!
- I don't give a fuck about the snow!

661
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,478
Shit! Where the hell's
that shotgun, Jack?

662
00:41:38,687 --> 00:41:40,668
- There's no shells.
- They're in the trunk.

663
00:41:40,876 --> 00:41:42,857
- What the hell am I...?
- Sit down and shut up!

664
00:41:43,066 --> 00:41:45,986
Angel, stick that cannon
out the window and bust some shots!

665
00:41:46,194 --> 00:41:48,801
I'm gonna put one
in the back of their heads!

666
00:41:49,948 --> 00:41:52,138
Shoot those sons of bitches, Angel!
Get them!

667
00:41:52,346 --> 00:41:53,910
Shoot that motherfucker!

668
00:41:57,872 --> 00:41:59,958
- You got him!
- Look out for the snow bank!

669
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:02,043
Look out!

670
00:42:06,631 --> 00:42:09,134
Jackie, you got your seat belt on?
Watch this. Hold on.

671
00:42:13,617 --> 00:42:15,390
Oh, shit!

672
00:42:16,745 --> 00:42:18,831
- Shit!
- Fuck that nigga. Just drive. Drive!

673
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:22,272
Don't let them get away!
Don't let them get away!

674
00:42:29,988 --> 00:42:31,552
I got them.

675
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:34,367
- Shit!
- I'm over this shit!

676
00:42:34,576 --> 00:42:36,765
Pop them, Angel! Pop them!
Get them!

677
00:42:39,164 --> 00:42:41,458
Angel, get your ass in here!

678
00:42:44,064 --> 00:42:46,046
Shit! We got a fucking blowout!

679
00:42:46,254 --> 00:42:48,548
Bobby, let's just stop the car!
Okay, Bobby? Let's stop!

680
00:42:48,757 --> 00:42:52,093
Shut up, Jack! I'm gonna ride
this bitch out on the rim! We got them!

681
00:43:08,568 --> 00:43:09,507
Ready?

682
00:43:15,033 --> 00:43:18,891
Hold on. Hold on.
I got them now. I got them.

683
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:20,455
- We got them now.
- We got them.

684
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:22,019
- On your side, man!
- Where they at?

685
00:43:22,228 --> 00:43:23,583
On your side. Look out. Look out!

686
00:43:25,564 --> 00:43:27,024
Hold on!

687
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:34,010
- Get them! Get them!
- Hold on!

688
00:43:52,258 --> 00:43:54,030
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

689
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,594
That's what
I'm talking about, Bobby.

690
00:44:04,353 --> 00:44:06,334
Jack, you wait here.

691
00:44:10,297 --> 00:44:12,799
- Get your punk ass out the car.
- Fuck you!

692
00:44:13,008 --> 00:44:16,970
- Who sent you?
- I ain't telling you shit!

693
00:44:19,472 --> 00:44:21,453
Get his wallet.

694
00:44:22,288 --> 00:44:24,686
You fucked with the wrong lady.

695
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,236
Let's get the fuck out of here, man.

696
00:44:40,327 --> 00:44:41,578
- Let's go! Come on.
- Are they dead?

697
00:44:41,786 --> 00:44:44,602
- Yeah, they gone!
- They killed Mom. We got them.

698
00:44:49,085 --> 00:44:53,673
- What's happening?
- Lieutenant. It's maximum ugly.

699
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:57,114
We got two obvious executions.

700
00:44:57,531 --> 00:44:59,095
Any IDs on them?

701
00:44:59,304 --> 00:45:02,432
No. I'll get their prints
before we put them on ice.

702
00:45:02,641 --> 00:45:06,081
What do you say, Green?
Any ideas?

703
00:45:06,394 --> 00:45:08,584
That's what we pay you for.

704
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,637
You're such a pussy, Bobby.

705
00:45:19,949 --> 00:45:22,139
- Give me a break, will you?
- It should be against the law

706
00:45:22,348 --> 00:45:24,850
for people to keep dogs where
someone like you can get to them.

707
00:45:25,059 --> 00:45:26,936
Hey, y'all! Police in the house!

708
00:45:27,144 --> 00:45:28,917
- Get me something to cover my arm.
- Yeah, yeah.

709
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:30,689
Shit. Hurry up.

710
00:45:35,173 --> 00:45:37,884
Angel. Mind if we come in?

711
00:45:38,093 --> 00:45:39,970
You're already in.

712
00:45:40,178 --> 00:45:41,846
Cops are always welcome
at the Mercers'.

713
00:45:42,055 --> 00:45:44,036
It makes us feel safe and cozy.

714
00:45:44,245 --> 00:45:47,268
Just the way we like it.

715
00:45:48,937 --> 00:45:51,022
Ain't you sexy.

716
00:45:51,439 --> 00:45:53,108
Thank you.

717
00:45:53,316 --> 00:45:56,027
Jackie wanted this little number
for himself, but I fought him for it.

718
00:45:58,425 --> 00:45:59,572
What happened to the hand?

719
00:46:00,407 --> 00:46:02,492
Did you happen to forget
our little conversation we had

720
00:46:02,701 --> 00:46:06,037
at your brother's house about
not interfering with our investigation?

721
00:46:06,246 --> 00:46:10,208
Oh, no, no. This is Turkey Cup, man.
Hockey.

722
00:46:10,417 --> 00:46:12,398
An old Mercer family tradition.

723
00:46:12,606 --> 00:46:14,796
You remember that, don't you, Green?
You played hockey.

724
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:17,716
Guys can be pretty rough
out on that ice.

725
00:46:17,924 --> 00:46:20,010
Where's you car, Bobby?

726
00:46:21,157 --> 00:46:22,512
It's not outside.

727
00:46:22,721 --> 00:46:26,370
- We left it at Jeremiah's.
- Yeah.

728
00:46:26,996 --> 00:46:28,247
Jerry drove us home.

729
00:46:28,455 --> 00:46:30,645
You know, Volvos are one
of the safest cars out there.

730
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:34,607
Volvos are incredible, man,
when it's a blizzard outside.

731
00:46:34,816 --> 00:46:36,693
- So we...
- Fascinating.

732
00:46:36,901 --> 00:46:38,674
Hey, Gretzky,
you know what this is?

733
00:46:38,883 --> 00:46:42,324
- A hair from your wife's tit?
- Try from your thick skull.

734
00:46:42,532 --> 00:46:46,182
Forensics took it off a pair of contract
killers we found dead this morning.

735
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:49,205
Fishing for a confession
with a phony hair, huh?

736
00:46:49,414 --> 00:46:53,272
That's an old one, boys.
Come on, Green.

737
00:46:54,419 --> 00:46:58,068
You know when I'll know you got
my hair off a dead body, right?

738
00:46:58,277 --> 00:47:01,092
When I hear the jailhouse doors
close behind me, girls.

739
00:47:01,301 --> 00:47:02,969
Okay, then you tell me
what they told you.

740
00:47:03,491 --> 00:47:06,931
You think that these thugs
were hired to kill Evelyn, is that it?

741
00:47:07,349 --> 00:47:09,121
I have no idea
what you're talking about, Green.

742
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:14,230
Wait, Green, how do you go from
petty thug to contract killer?

743
00:47:14,648 --> 00:47:17,254
And if they were
professional shooters, like you say,

744
00:47:17,671 --> 00:47:20,904
they'd have never told us who they
was working with anyway.

745
00:47:21,112 --> 00:47:23,615
Even if they got one hell
of an ass-whupping.

746
00:47:24,866 --> 00:47:27,786
You think you're pretty cute,
don't you? He does.

747
00:47:28,098 --> 00:47:30,184
Everybody's a smart guy
until I bust them in the mouth.

748
00:47:30,392 --> 00:47:31,748
- Wait!
- You gonna bust me in my mouth?

749
00:47:31,956 --> 00:47:34,250
- This ain't what I'm here for!
- The fuck you think this is?

750
00:47:34,459 --> 00:47:36,127
Hey, stop!

751
00:47:37,796 --> 00:47:41,132
Look, Bobby, if you got something,
you give it to me.

752
00:47:41,341 --> 00:47:43,218
And if it's something vital,
we will run with this.

753
00:47:43,426 --> 00:47:46,659
But don't try and take on Detroit
by your damn self.

754
00:47:46,867 --> 00:47:48,744
You keep knocking
on the devil's door long enough,

755
00:47:48,953 --> 00:47:51,247
and sooner or later,
somebody gonna answer you.

756
00:47:54,896 --> 00:47:56,982
What's up, guys?

757
00:47:57,816 --> 00:48:01,569
Oh, shit. Evan, Vic's here.
Vic's here.

758
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:04,280
- Ladies, get up.
- Get up. Come on, go, go!

759
00:48:04,489 --> 00:48:05,845
I'm going.

760
00:48:12,414 --> 00:48:14,812
Out-of-town shooters.

761
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:17,106
That's what I said.

762
00:48:17,314 --> 00:48:19,504
I remember hearing myself saying,

763
00:48:19,713 --> 00:48:22,736
"Out-of-town shooters."

764
00:48:22,945 --> 00:48:26,699
You know what?
You don't pay a ho to fuck you.

765
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:29,514
You pay her to leave.

766
00:48:30,348 --> 00:48:32,017
What you pay
out-of-town shooters to do?

767
00:48:32,851 --> 00:48:35,562
You pay them to get
the hell back out of town.

768
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:39,107
That's why I asked
for out-of-town shooters.

769
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:40,984
What'd I get?

770
00:48:41,401 --> 00:48:43,695
In-town shooters.

771
00:48:44,738 --> 00:48:49,743
Someone decided
to hire in-town shooters.

772
00:48:50,785 --> 00:48:52,558
You know what else
I got for my money?

773
00:48:52,766 --> 00:48:54,852
In-town police.

774
00:48:56,207 --> 00:48:58,501
In-town trouble.

775
00:49:00,065 --> 00:49:03,089
Who's got to get
in the ring with me on this?

776
00:49:04,028 --> 00:49:05,383
You hungry, Evan?

777
00:49:07,886 --> 00:49:10,284
You must be hungry, right?

778
00:49:12,474 --> 00:49:14,038
- I'm sorry...
- Don't apologize!

779
00:49:15,393 --> 00:49:17,687
Dog's gotta eat, right?

780
00:49:18,313 --> 00:49:20,920
I tell you what, you wanna come
in my restaurant and eat? Go ahead!

781
00:49:21,128 --> 00:49:22,171
Eat, dog, eat!

782
00:49:26,133 --> 00:49:28,010
Get the fuck out of my seat, man!

783
00:49:36,456 --> 00:49:38,124
Eat!

784
00:49:43,234 --> 00:49:45,215
That's a good boy.

785
00:49:45,945 --> 00:49:47,404
- That's a good boy.
- That's bullshit.

786
00:49:47,613 --> 00:49:50,741
Shut your mouth, bitch!
I'll put you down there with him.

787
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:55,850
Matter of fact, get your ass over here
and share a meal with your man!

788
00:49:56,476 --> 00:49:58,040
Now.

789
00:50:15,558 --> 00:50:17,226
Lap that shit up good.

790
00:50:22,961 --> 00:50:26,089
Now find out who killed
the shooters.

791
00:50:27,132 --> 00:50:30,260
- What bastard hired these guys?
- West Marine's by the river, right?

792
00:50:30,364 --> 00:50:33,492
- Yeah.
- Come on. Let's go take a look.

793
00:50:33,701 --> 00:50:35,161
All right.

794
00:50:38,289 --> 00:50:41,313
- Baby.
- Now, sweetie,

795
00:50:41,521 --> 00:50:44,649
wasn't there a discussion
about a dinner together?

796
00:50:44,858 --> 00:50:47,360
Because I seem to remember
spending two hours in the kitchen.

797
00:50:47,569 --> 00:50:49,446
We got some important shit
to deal with, baby.

798
00:50:49,654 --> 00:50:51,635
She's so la vida loca.

799
00:50:51,844 --> 00:50:53,825
- Man, don't do that right now.
- Shut up, Bobby.

800
00:50:54,034 --> 00:50:56,223
- Don't you start with that crap!
- Can y'all not go there?

801
00:50:56,432 --> 00:50:59,247
- That's why you don't get a girlfriend.
- Don't go there, please.

802
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:01,958
You know what?
I want a girlfriend like you.

803
00:51:03,105 --> 00:51:05,608
- Can we go?
- Angel.

804
00:51:05,816 --> 00:51:09,049
You said this time
was gonna be different.

805
00:51:12,385 --> 00:51:14,262
You're breaking mi corazn.

806
00:51:16,765 --> 00:51:18,433
She's getting
real comfortable here, huh?

807
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:19,851
What are you doing?

808
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:22,896
I thought you was a macho man.
A tough guy.

809
00:51:25,982 --> 00:51:29,152
You know, it's a real shame that little
Jackie's the only one down to ride.

810
00:51:29,361 --> 00:51:31,446
Let's go, Jackie.

811
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:33,615
Say goodbye
to your big sister, Jackie. Let's go.

812
00:51:33,782 --> 00:51:37,243
You gonna leave me too?
I just need 15 minutes, man.

813
00:51:37,452 --> 00:51:41,956
She's addicted
to what Angel's dick did.

814
00:51:46,378 --> 00:51:48,004
Sofi?

815
00:51:49,047 --> 00:51:50,590
Baby.

816
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:54,344
Just like when we were 16.

817
00:51:56,346 --> 00:51:58,306
My favorite room in the house.

818
00:51:58,556 --> 00:52:01,142
I already set it to spin.

819
00:52:11,486 --> 00:52:14,114
- Who are you?
- Hi, I'm with State Farm.

820
00:52:14,322 --> 00:52:16,992
I have a question or two about
your mother's insurance policy.

821
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:24,124
It's imperative that I speak
with Jeremiah immediately.

822
00:52:24,332 --> 00:52:25,375
The check is being processed,

823
00:52:25,583 --> 00:52:27,711
but nonetheless,
some red flags have been raised.

824
00:52:27,919 --> 00:52:29,129
What do you mean, red flags?

825
00:52:29,337 --> 00:52:32,716
Well, it's an unusually high payout
for a simple life-insurance policy.

826
00:52:32,924 --> 00:52:35,719
For the last two years,
the premium was paid via check

827
00:52:35,927 --> 00:52:37,429
from your brother's bank account.

828
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:41,558
With your brother's criminal record and
his business near bankruptcy, well,

829
00:52:41,766 --> 00:52:43,893
- it's our responsibility to investigate.
- Bankruptcy?

830
00:52:44,102 --> 00:52:46,813
Wait, so Jeremiah's broke?

831
00:52:47,981 --> 00:52:50,817
- Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt.
- Certainly.

832
00:52:51,026 --> 00:52:53,028
- Angel, can I ask you a question?
- Yeah, baby.

833
00:52:53,236 --> 00:52:55,864
What the hell is this?

834
00:52:56,072 --> 00:52:57,949
Oh, those are breath mints, baby.
Give me one sec...

835
00:52:58,158 --> 00:53:00,118
- You know I'm allergic to latex.
- I should be going.

836
00:53:00,327 --> 00:53:02,329
- No, no. Hold on, please.
- Who did you buy them for?

837
00:53:02,537 --> 00:53:03,997
Put the cuckoo back
in the clock, baby.

838
00:53:04,164 --> 00:53:06,291
I bought them in Vegas before
I knew I was coming here.

839
00:53:06,499 --> 00:53:08,084
- Who are they for?
- For no one!

840
00:53:08,293 --> 00:53:10,003
Please, sir, please.

841
00:53:10,211 --> 00:53:11,588
Baby, if we gonna talk about this,

842
00:53:11,796 --> 00:53:14,674
- can we please do it outside?
- Okay, you wanna talk outside?

843
00:53:14,883 --> 00:53:16,301
Well then fine, let's talk outside!

844
00:53:16,509 --> 00:53:18,428
We're gonna talk right now.
We're gonna talk right...

845
00:53:18,637 --> 00:53:21,014
Get your ass out of here, girl.

846
00:53:24,059 --> 00:53:25,644
So how much is my brother getting?

847
00:53:25,852 --> 00:53:29,314
- A little more than 400,000.
- Open the door now.

848
00:53:29,564 --> 00:53:30,565
That's crazy.

849
00:53:30,899 --> 00:53:33,276
Check everything, Jackie. There's
gotta be some shit around here

850
00:53:33,485 --> 00:53:35,528
that ties these guys
to somebody else.

851
00:53:58,385 --> 00:54:01,846
You dicking around in here?
You find anything?

852
00:54:02,931 --> 00:54:04,641
A camera.

853
00:54:04,849 --> 00:54:06,059
Come on.

854
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:08,395
Thank you.

855
00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:11,147
- Big Chief.
- Hey, thanks.

856
00:54:11,564 --> 00:54:14,651
Angel Mercer. How you doing?

857
00:54:14,859 --> 00:54:17,404
I ain't worked for Jerry
for a long time.

858
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:20,240
Not since he started up
those luxury condos.

859
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:23,785
High-dollar stuff like that brings in
all the gangsters.

860
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:26,705
Wait. So you're saying Jerry
got mixed in with some gangsters?

861
00:54:27,122 --> 00:54:29,165
What's going on?

862
00:54:29,374 --> 00:54:33,336
There's this do-gooder. He's on
city council. His name's Douglas.

863
00:54:33,545 --> 00:54:35,171
- Okay.
- He's the guy who shut down

864
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:37,215
Jerry's warehouse project.

865
00:54:37,632 --> 00:54:39,676
He'll know who Jerry
got mixed up with.

866
00:54:43,722 --> 00:54:46,099
SIG Sauer.45 auto.

867
00:54:46,308 --> 00:54:48,852
That'll blow your back out.

868
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:54,274
Nine millimeter Beretta.

869
00:54:54,482 --> 00:54:55,984
Oh, look at this Beretta.

870
00:54:56,192 --> 00:54:58,945
It's triple-action.
Three bullets at once.

871
00:54:59,154 --> 00:55:00,280
They say dead men tell no tales,

872
00:55:00,488 --> 00:55:02,282
but they sure leave
important shit lying around.

873
00:55:02,449 --> 00:55:04,284
Hey, what the hell
are y'all doing now?

874
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,287
Just getting a head start
on next year's taxes, Jerry.

875
00:55:07,454 --> 00:55:10,457
Look how y'all doing
Mama's house!

876
00:55:10,665 --> 00:55:13,126
Come on. Look at this table, man.
Come on.

877
00:55:13,293 --> 00:55:15,420
- You know what? You're right.
- Hey, Sofi, why don't you

878
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:17,297
do me a favor
and clean up some of this shit?

879
00:55:17,464 --> 00:55:19,299
Make yourself useful.

880
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:22,886
You missed.

881
00:55:24,763 --> 00:55:26,389
Hey, Bobby.

882
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:31,978
- Where'd y'all get this?
- Our friend Stanly, the shooter.

883
00:55:32,187 --> 00:55:34,064
Let me see that.

884
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:36,816
- They were tracking Mom.
- That's that guy.

885
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:39,486
That's that lawyer guy.
That shithead said...

886
00:55:39,694 --> 00:55:41,821
He said he only met
her once, Bobby.

887
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:44,366
Where the hell you been?
I been trying to call you all day.

888
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:45,867
Following up new leads.

889
00:55:47,619 --> 00:55:49,371
Yep. Let's go.

890
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:52,499
Jerry, you coming with us? Don't
you wanna find out who hired them?

891
00:55:52,707 --> 00:55:54,626
Yeah, don't you wanna
find out who killed Mom?

892
00:55:54,834 --> 00:55:57,629
- Of course I do, man.
- Let's go. Stop bullshitting. Come on.

893
00:55:57,837 --> 00:55:59,172
All right.

894
00:55:59,381 --> 00:56:01,174
Somebody gotta look after
y'all clowns.

895
00:56:02,425 --> 00:56:06,763
- Oh, so now you calling us clowns?
- Well, I call it like I see it.

896
00:56:08,014 --> 00:56:09,391
- What?
- You're gonna leave again?

897
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,017
- That's your problem.
- Okay, fine.

898
00:56:11,226 --> 00:56:13,353
- Go. Go.
- You gonna be here. Whatever.

899
00:56:13,561 --> 00:56:16,731
We might have to spend
the night up in this bitch.

900
00:56:18,525 --> 00:56:21,403
An attack dog.
Come here, poochie.

901
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:24,114
You don't wanna bite me, do you?

902
00:56:24,614 --> 00:56:26,199
You gonna bite me, baby?

903
00:56:26,533 --> 00:56:29,202
Hey, Bobby, check this out.
I found Bradford's calendar.

904
00:56:29,411 --> 00:56:34,416
You don't think "EM" stands
for Evelyn Mercer, do you?

905
00:56:34,624 --> 00:56:38,920
- You're getting good at this, Jackie.
- November 21.

906
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:41,589
He met up with her
the night she died.

907
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:44,217
Why would anybody meet up
with their lawyer at 8:00 at night?

908
00:56:44,384 --> 00:56:46,177
Angel!

909
00:56:47,429 --> 00:56:49,306
- Nice. Your girlfriend's here.
- She's crazy, man.

910
00:56:49,514 --> 00:56:50,724
Well, go shut her up then.

911
00:56:50,932 --> 00:56:54,811
Angel! Angel, come out!
I see you in the window!

912
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:57,105
Come out, you idiot!
I know you're in there!

913
00:56:57,314 --> 00:56:59,441
Y'all come out here with me.
This girl is crazy.

914
00:56:59,649 --> 00:57:03,653
Angel! People, there's robbers
in the house!

915
00:57:04,112 --> 00:57:05,113
Come out, Angel!

916
00:57:05,322 --> 00:57:07,324
- I'm gonna call the police now!
- Come on!

917
00:57:07,532 --> 00:57:09,034
You better call
immigration on this girl.

918
00:57:09,242 --> 00:57:12,037
You've got a real class act here.

919
00:57:13,788 --> 00:57:15,582
- She should be at Guantanamo Bay.
- Oh, my God.

920
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:17,083
Locked up.

921
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,962
Excuse me. What are you doing?

922
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:23,298
- How you doing, buddy?
- Bobby! Bobby! He's a lawyer!

923
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:25,175
- What's going on here?
- He's a liar, Jerry!

924
00:57:25,383 --> 00:57:27,177
- Ain't nobody's business! Stay away!
- Come here!

925
00:57:27,385 --> 00:57:28,887
You heard me, old man.

926
00:57:29,137 --> 00:57:31,848
You fucking lied to me. You said
you didn't even know my mother.

927
00:57:32,057 --> 00:57:34,976
You were the last person
to see her alive.

928
00:57:35,935 --> 00:57:38,188
Look at that, Jerry. It leaves
a nice big red handprint, huh?

929
00:57:38,563 --> 00:57:39,689
Just ask him the question.

930
00:57:39,898 --> 00:57:44,277
No, I'm gonna do it again and again
until I find out what I wanna know.

931
00:57:44,444 --> 00:57:45,570
- Oh, God!
- Tell him!

932
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:48,698
Okay. Okay, I'll explain.

933
00:57:48,907 --> 00:57:50,450
It's just that I...

934
00:57:50,659 --> 00:57:53,453
- I felt so guilty.
- Guilty for what?

935
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:56,706
I'm not even sure
I know how to say it.

936
00:57:56,915 --> 00:57:59,334
- Say what?
- Your mother and I were...

937
00:58:00,001 --> 00:58:01,795
Were seeing each other socially.

938
00:58:02,003 --> 00:58:04,923
- Socially?
- I didn't want to sully

939
00:58:05,131 --> 00:58:06,341
your mother's reputation.

940
00:58:06,549 --> 00:58:08,927
- She was a fine, fine woman.
- I know. I know.

941
00:58:09,177 --> 00:58:10,720
I have some of your mother's
night things,

942
00:58:10,929 --> 00:58:12,305
- if you want. They...
- What?

943
00:58:12,472 --> 00:58:14,975
- No. No, it's not necessary.
- Too much information.

944
00:58:15,183 --> 00:58:17,394
Baby, listen, I need you
to get out of here.

945
00:58:17,602 --> 00:58:20,563
I apologize, Mr. Bradford.
We broke your back window.

946
00:58:20,772 --> 00:58:22,524
We're just trying to figure
out what happened.

947
00:58:22,732 --> 00:58:25,026
- I understand.
- Thank you. I appreciate that.

948
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:27,195
- You have a beautiful home here.
- Thank you.

949
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:34,077
- Hey, Bobby.
- Yo.

950
00:58:39,207 --> 00:58:42,711
- Hey, man. I gotta ask you a question.
- What's up?

951
00:58:42,919 --> 00:58:45,839
You know me and Sofi
did a lot of making up last night.

952
00:58:46,047 --> 00:58:48,967
- You gave her that ring, huh?
- Yeah.

953
00:58:49,175 --> 00:58:53,346
But it seem like I got
a little rust on the tools down here.

954
00:58:53,555 --> 00:58:55,598
Ask the cockologist
in the shower, man.

955
00:58:55,807 --> 00:58:57,809
- How the hell would I know?
- You're the expert.

956
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:04,441
- Rug burn.
- You're gonna live.

957
00:59:04,649 --> 00:59:06,860
Thank God, man.
I thought my luck ran out.

958
00:59:11,406 --> 00:59:12,866
Hey, listen, man.

959
00:59:13,074 --> 00:59:14,784
You know, Jerry
ain't been straight up with us

960
00:59:14,993 --> 00:59:17,078
about that redevelopment project.

961
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:21,207
Found out his dream's dead. Jerry
got involved with some bad people.

962
00:59:21,416 --> 00:59:23,752
City got on him about fraud
and whatnot.

963
00:59:24,169 --> 00:59:26,129
Cut his loans off like a month ago.

964
00:59:26,338 --> 00:59:29,466
- Technically, Jerry's really broke.
- You think this had something to do

965
00:59:29,674 --> 00:59:30,800
with what happened to Mom?

966
00:59:31,009 --> 00:59:33,386
No, I'm saying that it's something
that we should look into.

967
00:59:33,887 --> 00:59:37,891
I need y'all to go down and visit
this city official named Douglas.

968
00:59:38,099 --> 00:59:39,893
He'll know who Jerry
got mixed up with.

969
00:59:40,435 --> 00:59:41,895
I'm gonna go check
on some other shit.

970
00:59:42,103 --> 00:59:43,104
What are you talking about?

971
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:45,273
Why don't you just tell me
what you know, Angel?

972
00:59:45,482 --> 00:59:48,318
I know you need to stay your ass
on that porcelain.

973
00:59:48,526 --> 00:59:51,029
This is gonna require a little finesse.

974
00:59:51,237 --> 00:59:53,114
And given your prior reputation
as a hothead,

975
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:56,117
- I wrote the fucking book on finesse.
- You gonna be the first to fuck up.

976
00:59:56,326 --> 00:59:59,329
Wait for me to wipe my ass, Angel.
I'm coming with you.

977
00:59:59,537 --> 01:00:01,081
Angel!

978
01:00:01,956 --> 01:00:04,000
Get me some
fucking toilet paper, Jack.

979
01:00:04,459 --> 01:00:05,418
Angel!

980
01:00:06,044 --> 01:00:09,339
You know, you didn't come up
on the list of any of Evelyn's friends

981
01:00:09,547 --> 01:00:12,968
- or known associates, Mr. Bradford.
- No?

982
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:16,471
I got your name
off of her phone records.

983
01:00:17,889 --> 01:00:19,432
Well...

984
01:00:19,641 --> 01:00:23,228
Well, yes. Yes, we did try to keep
our relationship

985
01:00:23,436 --> 01:00:26,606
- somewhat discreet.
- There we go. There we go.

986
01:00:26,773 --> 01:00:29,275
You know, well,
maybe you can help me then.

987
01:00:29,484 --> 01:00:34,447
You see, what I've gathered so far,
it seems that...

988
01:00:34,656 --> 01:00:38,410
...Evelyn had become upset with
her son Jeremiah's business situation.

989
01:00:38,618 --> 01:00:41,079
Yes, she was starting
to raise a bit of a stink.

990
01:00:41,287 --> 01:00:45,917
But... But wasn't all that covered
in the police report that she filed?

991
01:00:47,294 --> 01:00:49,254
What police report?

992
01:00:51,798 --> 01:00:53,633
Councilman Douglas.

993
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,010
Sorry to startle you.

994
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:57,595
My name's Bobby Mercer. I believe
you know my brother, Jeremiah?

995
01:00:57,804 --> 01:01:00,640
Apparently, you were the one
who got his business shut down, right?

996
01:01:00,807 --> 01:01:02,642
This is not the proper venue
for an appeal.

997
01:01:02,851 --> 01:01:04,894
Look, we're not really concerned
with that, councilman.

998
01:01:05,103 --> 01:01:06,980
I heard my brother got mixed
up with some hoodlums.

999
01:01:07,147 --> 01:01:09,274
You know what I'm talking about?

1000
01:01:09,482 --> 01:01:12,902
I can't help you. Excuse me.

1001
01:01:33,465 --> 01:01:35,258
Gas?

1002
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:38,345
Councilman!

1003
01:01:39,721 --> 01:01:43,058
Now I gotta light your ass on fire!
All I wanted was a name!

1004
01:01:43,558 --> 01:01:47,604
You're gonna make me turn your ass
into the black gingerbread man now!

1005
01:01:47,812 --> 01:01:48,980
It's all right.

1006
01:01:49,189 --> 01:01:51,232
I'll have my little brother
here suck your burning dick.

1007
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:54,653
Give me the fucking cigarette.
Roll down the window.

1008
01:01:56,196 --> 01:01:58,782
Victor. Victor Sweet.

1009
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:00,575
What about him?

1010
01:02:04,621 --> 01:02:06,623
Is there a problem?

1011
01:02:18,009 --> 01:02:20,553
Goddamn, Jerry.

1012
01:02:23,056 --> 01:02:25,225
There she is.

1013
01:02:25,642 --> 01:02:27,435
So she got in there at 6:05.

1014
01:02:27,894 --> 01:02:30,021
Fast-forward that.

1015
01:02:31,815 --> 01:02:33,566
Hey, look. That's Fowler.

1016
01:02:34,234 --> 01:02:38,697
Wait, pause it, pause it. He didn't say
anything to me about talking to her.

1017
01:02:39,406 --> 01:02:42,575
Fast-forward to when she leaves.

1018
01:02:43,201 --> 01:02:44,953
Okay, stop.

1019
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:49,457
So she was here until 7:11.

1020
01:02:57,132 --> 01:02:59,759
He spent more than an hour
with her.

1021
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:03,346
- What do you think he found?
- I don't know, but it's something big.

1022
01:03:03,555 --> 01:03:05,557
- How can you tell?
- By the sound of his voice.

1023
01:03:05,765 --> 01:03:07,392
I know my brother.

1024
01:03:10,478 --> 01:03:12,731
What's going on, Angel?

1025
01:03:13,106 --> 01:03:17,736
- Was that councilman helpful?
- Oh, yeah. A real public servant.

1026
01:03:19,321 --> 01:03:21,990
You remember a punk
named Victor Sweet?

1027
01:03:22,490 --> 01:03:25,785
- I remember a Malcolm Sweet.
- Victor was his nephew.

1028
01:03:25,952 --> 01:03:29,205
Used to deliver things for his uncle.
Like firebombs and beatings.

1029
01:03:29,414 --> 01:03:33,084
You remember. Malcolm used
to love to humiliate him all the time.

1030
01:03:33,293 --> 01:03:34,794
Yeah, I remember that dude.

1031
01:03:35,003 --> 01:03:36,796
Apparently, Victor got sick
of the ass-whuppings

1032
01:03:36,963 --> 01:03:38,590
and sunk his uncle into the river.

1033
01:03:38,798 --> 01:03:40,634
He owns
the whole neighborhood now.

1034
01:03:40,842 --> 01:03:42,677
No shit?

1035
01:03:43,595 --> 01:03:45,472
Hey, Bobby.

1036
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:50,977
Word around town is that Jerry
owed a lot of people some money.

1037
01:03:51,186 --> 01:03:53,188
What are you talking about?

1038
01:03:55,106 --> 01:03:58,193
Recognize that dude over
there with the fat head?

1039
01:03:58,401 --> 01:04:02,155
Yeah, that's Evander Pearson.
He used to be all right, that guy.

1040
01:04:02,364 --> 01:04:04,157
Jerry and him used to hang
during the union days.

1041
01:04:04,366 --> 01:04:07,535
He goes by Evan now. And he's
working for a guy named Victor.

1042
01:04:09,788 --> 01:04:11,706
You guys are coming
up with this pretty quick.

1043
01:04:11,915 --> 01:04:14,167
Yeah, we should have been cops.

1044
01:04:17,295 --> 01:04:19,047
What are we doing here, Angel?

1045
01:04:19,255 --> 01:04:21,174
Holy shit.

1046
01:04:33,019 --> 01:04:35,021
- Evan.
- Jerry.

1047
01:04:35,188 --> 01:04:37,190
I hate meeting you here, man,
with your kids and all,

1048
01:04:37,399 --> 01:04:38,608
but you know how it goes.

1049
01:04:38,817 --> 01:04:40,944
- I understand.
- I got it.

1050
01:04:42,153 --> 01:04:46,658
I found out Jerry got a big
insurance check for Mom's death.

1051
01:04:47,325 --> 01:04:48,952
Be cool, brother.

1052
01:04:50,412 --> 01:04:53,331
Forget Jerry. We're gonna
find him later. Come on.

1053
01:05:00,755 --> 01:05:03,842
- Yo, Evander! What's up?
- Muriel! We leaving.

1054
01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:06,428
- Game's over. Let's go.
- Put your jacket on. It's time to go.

1055
01:05:08,763 --> 01:05:10,890
It's nice to see you, boys,
but we was just leaving.

1056
01:05:11,099 --> 01:05:13,601
You ain't going nowhere.
What was you talking to Jerry about?

1057
01:05:13,810 --> 01:05:15,228
Nothing. Just saying hello.

1058
01:05:15,395 --> 01:05:18,231
Me and Jerry go way back from
the union days. You know that, Bobby.

1059
01:05:18,732 --> 01:05:20,692
Angel tells me you're
one of Victor Sweet's boys now.

1060
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:23,570
Hear he's running shit like his uncle.
Treating you like a house nigger.

1061
01:05:23,778 --> 01:05:26,448
What are you thinking about, Evan?
The dude's a punk.

1062
01:05:27,157 --> 01:05:30,744
You been gone a long time, fellas.
Times change.

1063
01:05:31,244 --> 01:05:33,413
- What's in that envelope?
- What envelope?

1064
01:05:33,621 --> 01:05:35,582
You wanna play that fucking game
with me right now?

1065
01:05:37,417 --> 01:05:40,420
- Y'all gonna do this here?
- Right here. Right now.

1066
01:05:40,629 --> 01:05:44,257
Give me the envelope
and take a walk. Now!

1067
01:05:48,762 --> 01:05:50,430
Go ahead, Evander.
Take the kids home.

1068
01:05:50,639 --> 01:05:52,682
We'll see your ass again real soon.

1069
01:05:52,891 --> 01:05:54,684
Let's go.

1070
01:05:55,185 --> 01:05:56,227
Hurry up.

1071
01:05:59,356 --> 01:06:00,607
Councilman.

1072
01:06:00,815 --> 01:06:02,859
Pull up a chair.

1073
01:06:09,282 --> 01:06:11,951
Vic, this cop came
to see me today,

1074
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:14,788
and he was asking
about that woman.

1075
01:06:16,081 --> 01:06:18,249
Don't worry about cops.

1076
01:06:18,458 --> 01:06:20,627
- I got cops.
- No, I'm not.

1077
01:06:20,794 --> 01:06:23,546
But I'm worried about this guy
Bobby Mercer.

1078
01:06:23,755 --> 01:06:25,465
He came to see me
after the cop did.

1079
01:06:25,882 --> 01:06:28,009
You tell him my name?

1080
01:06:28,218 --> 01:06:30,762
Of course not, Vic. I mean...

1081
01:06:30,971 --> 01:06:33,974
But look, you know, we can't
do business like this anymore.

1082
01:06:34,557 --> 01:06:35,725
Nothing's changing.

1083
01:06:35,934 --> 01:06:38,520
Evan and I were just talking
about this fella, Bobby Mercer.

1084
01:06:44,192 --> 01:06:50,615
- Vic, I did not tell the man anything.
- Did you tell him my name?

1085
01:06:50,824 --> 01:06:53,952
- No, I swear...
- Yes, you did! You stinking coward.

1086
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,329
I smelled it on you
the second you walked in here.

1087
01:06:56,538 --> 01:06:59,040
Now go sit at the other table.

1088
01:07:02,877 --> 01:07:05,630
- Excuse me?
- Go sit at the kiddie table!

1089
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:10,093
I ain't finished with you. I ain't finished
my hand, so sit your ass down!

1090
01:07:11,678 --> 01:07:15,515
- Are you in trouble?
- He's on a time-out.

1091
01:07:16,850 --> 01:07:18,435
Come on, man, what you got?

1092
01:07:21,813 --> 01:07:24,691
No. I'm out.

1093
01:07:26,359 --> 01:07:29,154
Nines. Won again.

1094
01:07:29,362 --> 01:07:30,363
Oh, Charlie.

1095
01:07:30,572 --> 01:07:33,950
I heard you're marrying
that fine piece of ass of yours.

1096
01:07:34,826 --> 01:07:37,245
Yeah, that's right, that's right.
This spring, in fact.

1097
01:07:37,454 --> 01:07:39,581
How about I send you
on a little out-of-town work, huh?

1098
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:41,708
Give me a little
one-on-one time alone

1099
01:07:41,916 --> 01:07:44,794
with that cute little Italian thing
of yours, huh?

1100
01:07:45,337 --> 01:07:46,796
How would that be?

1101
01:07:47,005 --> 01:07:49,215
I'll teach her some nice tricks
for you.

1102
01:07:49,424 --> 01:07:51,509
Yeah, maybe you can teach her
how to cook.

1103
01:07:51,718 --> 01:07:54,095
No, man, I'll teach her better things
than that.

1104
01:07:54,304 --> 01:07:56,306
She's too much woman
for you, Charlie.

1105
01:07:56,514 --> 01:07:59,225
You're gonna have
to share her around a bit.

1106
01:08:02,437 --> 01:08:06,024
- Nine! My turn!
- You're the one that...

1107
01:08:06,399 --> 01:08:07,525
All right, you kids.

1108
01:08:09,486 --> 01:08:12,030
- Who wants some ice cream, huh?
- Me!

1109
01:08:12,238 --> 01:08:16,701
Why don't you run upstairs. We'll get
you some ice cream. Go on now.

1110
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:32,467
Evan.

1111
01:08:33,093 --> 01:08:34,719
Pistol.

1112
01:08:36,638 --> 01:08:38,014
I ain't playing no more.

1113
01:08:38,223 --> 01:08:41,101
I'm gonna go in there and bust that
melon and find out what he's thinking.

1114
01:08:41,476 --> 01:08:42,852
His family's in there.

1115
01:08:43,395 --> 01:08:45,647
- You're gonna have to calm down.
- I don't give a shit, man.

1116
01:08:45,855 --> 01:08:47,482
Oh, I'm calm.

1117
01:08:47,691 --> 01:08:49,567
- I'm calm.
- Let me just call him.

1118
01:08:49,776 --> 01:08:51,236
He thinks I'm an idiot.

1119
01:08:51,444 --> 01:08:54,489
He thinks I don't know
what the fuck is going on.

1120
01:08:55,365 --> 01:08:56,533
- Jerry.
- Yeah?

1121
01:08:56,741 --> 01:08:58,493
- It's Angel.
- What's up, man?

1122
01:08:58,702 --> 01:09:02,122
Look, man. We need to meet up first
thing tomorrow at Mom's house.

1123
01:09:02,330 --> 01:09:03,832
- I'm gonna kill him.
- Calm down, Bobby.

1124
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:06,084
We still family, right?

1125
01:09:07,294 --> 01:09:09,379
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Yeah, man.

1126
01:09:10,005 --> 01:09:11,298
Okay.

1127
01:09:11,464 --> 01:09:14,092
- Is he coming?
- Yeah.

1128
01:09:14,301 --> 01:09:15,302
Good.

1129
01:09:43,997 --> 01:09:46,499
- What?
- You know what you did.

1130
01:09:46,708 --> 01:09:49,294
No! You don't know
who you fucking with!

1131
01:09:49,502 --> 01:09:51,171
Where's Bobby?

1132
01:09:52,339 --> 01:09:54,966
- What are you hiding, Jerry? What?
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

1133
01:09:55,175 --> 01:09:57,052
If you had something to do
with what happened,

1134
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:59,596
I swear to God, Jerry,
I'm gonna kill you right here and now!

1135
01:09:59,804 --> 01:10:01,681
- No, Bobby, no!
- Angel's gonna ask some questions.

1136
01:10:01,890 --> 01:10:04,351
And, brother, I shit you not,
the time for lying is over.

1137
01:10:04,517 --> 01:10:06,061
We know you're lying
about your business.

1138
01:10:06,269 --> 01:10:08,146
And we know you got mixed up
with some gangsters.

1139
01:10:08,355 --> 01:10:10,065
- Hold on...
- Stay down!

1140
01:10:12,233 --> 01:10:14,402
Y'all think I had something to do
with Mom getting killed?

1141
01:10:14,611 --> 01:10:17,947
You got a check for 400,000 that you
just so happened to forget to mention

1142
01:10:18,156 --> 01:10:21,034
- from Mom's life insurance.
- She took out the policy for the girls.

1143
01:10:21,201 --> 01:10:23,328
Man, I ain't have nothing
to do with that. Come on.

1144
01:10:23,536 --> 01:10:25,789
- You made the payments!
- Good timing, Jerry.

1145
01:10:25,997 --> 01:10:27,582
Just when it seems like
all is lost for you,

1146
01:10:27,791 --> 01:10:30,335
Mom gets shot by some gangsters
and now you hit the fucking lottery!

1147
01:10:30,543 --> 01:10:33,797
So y'all...? Y'all tripping
because I made insurance payments?

1148
01:10:34,005 --> 01:10:36,508
What? I paid all her bills!

1149
01:10:39,719 --> 01:10:40,887
Where the fuck were y'all?

1150
01:10:42,931 --> 01:10:45,809
How many years did I have
to take care of her my goddamn self?

1151
01:10:46,017 --> 01:10:48,728
Y'all were around doing nothing!
Bullshitting!

1152
01:10:49,521 --> 01:10:51,439
And you gonna tell me I killed her?
Come on, man!

1153
01:10:51,648 --> 01:10:53,566
So why would you pay off
a killer like Sweet?

1154
01:10:53,775 --> 01:10:55,777
And what the fuck
did he do for you, Jerry?

1155
01:10:55,986 --> 01:10:58,488
What did he do for me?
He killed my fucking life!

1156
01:10:58,697 --> 01:11:00,198
I put everything in that project!

1157
01:11:00,407 --> 01:11:02,617
I bet it all trying to make
something of myself!

1158
01:11:02,826 --> 01:11:03,952
Trying to make the shit work!

1159
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:06,079
Then Vic's goons gonna
come try to take a piece.

1160
01:11:06,287 --> 01:11:08,081
You paid him, Jerry.
You got in bed with him.

1161
01:11:08,248 --> 01:11:10,834
No, no, I didn't pay them! That's
how they fucking shut me down!

1162
01:11:11,042 --> 01:11:12,252
I thought the city cut you off.

1163
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:14,337
Douglas? Come on, man.
This is Detroit!

1164
01:11:14,546 --> 01:11:17,424
Sweet owns Douglas! He ain't nothing
but a gangster in a suit!

1165
01:11:17,590 --> 01:11:19,426
I don't pay him,
and now he shuts my loans off!

1166
01:11:19,634 --> 01:11:22,262
- End of story, end of project.
- So, what about the 20 grand?

1167
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:25,598
I just told you. You wanna cross
the bridge, you gotta pay the toll.

1168
01:11:25,807 --> 01:11:28,059
I took the money. I was gonna pay
the bribe until y'all fucked it up.

1169
01:11:28,059 --> 01:11:28,560
I took the money. I was gonna pay
the bribe until y'all fucked it up.

1170
01:11:28,768 --> 01:11:29,936
Your mother was a whore!

1171
01:11:31,646 --> 01:11:33,106
Hey, fuck you, man! I will kick your...

1172
01:11:35,942 --> 01:11:37,193
It's all about Jerry, right?

1173
01:11:37,402 --> 01:11:39,154
Son of a bitch! Piece of shit!

1174
01:11:39,612 --> 01:11:41,531
Jack. Jack!

1175
01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:48,997
Jack!

1176
01:11:58,048 --> 01:11:59,799
Shit.

1177
01:12:03,928 --> 01:12:07,057
Shit! Get down!
Get the fuck down!

1178
01:12:07,265 --> 01:12:09,309
- Come on! Get down!
- Jack! Bobby!

1179
01:12:14,606 --> 01:12:15,982
Shit!

1180
01:12:20,945 --> 01:12:22,405
- Bobby!
- Jack.

1181
01:12:22,614 --> 01:12:24,407
- Bobby!
- Jack!

1182
01:12:27,327 --> 01:12:28,995
Sofi, give me the gun!

1183
01:12:50,308 --> 01:12:52,018
- Bobby!
- Jack, hold on!

1184
01:13:04,864 --> 01:13:06,449
Shit!

1185
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:11,955
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

1186
01:13:14,624 --> 01:13:16,167
He's behind the bricks!
Jackhammer!

1187
01:13:23,883 --> 01:13:25,802
Jeremiah, where are you going?

1188
01:13:26,678 --> 01:13:28,054
Jack!

1189
01:13:33,268 --> 01:13:35,395
I got kids! A wife.

1190
01:13:36,855 --> 01:13:38,732
A family.

1191
01:14:16,770 --> 01:14:19,105
Oh, shit.

1192
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:22,025
Fuck.

1193
01:14:32,702 --> 01:14:34,162
Motherfucker!

1194
01:14:42,796 --> 01:14:44,172
You fucking...

1195
01:14:58,812 --> 01:15:00,230
Bobby!

1196
01:15:00,605 --> 01:15:02,983
Bobby! Bobby!

1197
01:15:03,149 --> 01:15:04,526
The van! Watch out!

1198
01:15:11,324 --> 01:15:13,326
Jack! Jack, look at me!

1199
01:15:13,493 --> 01:15:15,286
Jack, you all right? Hold on.

1200
01:15:15,495 --> 01:15:17,747
We need an ambulance!

1201
01:15:18,957 --> 01:15:21,334
Somebody help! Call 911!

1202
01:15:21,835 --> 01:15:24,170
Jack. Jack.

1203
01:15:24,379 --> 01:15:25,672
Jack!

1204
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:27,507
Jack, please.

1205
01:15:27,716 --> 01:15:29,342
- Come on, man.
- I'm calling, I'm calling.

1206
01:15:29,551 --> 01:15:32,304
- Come on, Jack, you gotta breathe!
- We need an ambulance right now!

1207
01:15:32,512 --> 01:15:35,974
Don't you die on me, you little fairy.
Come on, Jack. Please!

1208
01:15:36,182 --> 01:15:38,518
You gotta fucking breathe!
Come on!

1209
01:15:43,648 --> 01:15:45,191
Jack!

1210
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:46,776
Jack.

1211
01:15:46,985 --> 01:15:50,947
Jack, come on, Jack, please!

1212
01:15:51,364 --> 01:15:52,907
Please...

1213
01:15:54,576 --> 01:15:55,785
Jack.

1214
01:16:16,056 --> 01:16:20,185
- Who sent you? Victor Sweet?
- Yeah. Yeah, it was Sweet.

1215
01:16:20,977 --> 01:16:22,646
Thank God.

1216
01:16:22,854 --> 01:16:24,856
Thank God?

1217
01:16:25,357 --> 01:16:27,859
He killed my mother and my little
brother, you motherfucker!

1218
01:16:28,068 --> 01:16:30,278
Thank Victor Sweet.

1219
01:16:32,405 --> 01:16:34,824
Photograph them.

1220
01:16:37,410 --> 01:16:40,246
Hey, let me talk to them, okay?

1221
01:16:42,916 --> 01:16:44,834
Look, I'm real sorry, man.

1222
01:16:45,043 --> 01:16:46,836
I really am.

1223
01:16:47,045 --> 01:16:49,047
But what happened here?

1224
01:16:49,255 --> 01:16:51,257
Victor Sweet did this.

1225
01:16:51,424 --> 01:16:52,509
How do you figure that?

1226
01:16:52,717 --> 01:16:54,511
Because his friend in the bag
over there told me.

1227
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:57,222
Okay, I'll make sure I get
a statement from him then.

1228
01:16:57,430 --> 01:16:59,933
Why did Sweet do us like this, man?

1229
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:02,727
And why did it have
to be our moms?

1230
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:06,856
Because Evelyn was going after him.

1231
01:17:07,232 --> 01:17:09,234
She knew her son, man.

1232
01:17:09,442 --> 01:17:12,195
She never thought for a second
that you were corrupt.

1233
01:17:12,404 --> 01:17:14,406
But I never told her
about my business.

1234
01:17:14,614 --> 01:17:17,200
Jerry, were you ever able
to keep a secret from her?

1235
01:17:17,409 --> 01:17:19,953
She knew all about
your trouble, man.

1236
01:17:20,161 --> 01:17:22,080
The moment they shut you down,
she went down there,

1237
01:17:22,288 --> 01:17:26,251
- raising hell with the councilman.
- You gonna bury Sweet, or are we?

1238
01:17:28,461 --> 01:17:30,797
Well, I got me...

1239
01:17:32,132 --> 01:17:34,259
...a dirty uniform I gotta deal with first.
- What?

1240
01:17:34,467 --> 01:17:37,971
You see, Evelyn filed a report that
got passed on to Victor Sweet.

1241
01:17:38,179 --> 01:17:39,973
- By who?
- Look, I just got something I...

1242
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:43,268
Don't bullshit me, Green.
Who are you protecting?

1243
01:17:43,476 --> 01:17:46,896
- Your boy Fowler?
- Look, Fowler's my problem!

1244
01:17:47,105 --> 01:17:50,984
I'll deal with him.
And then we get Sweet.

1245
01:17:53,361 --> 01:17:55,113
Green.

1246
01:17:55,739 --> 01:17:57,657
So how we gonna deal
with all this?

1247
01:17:58,867 --> 01:18:00,076
Self-defense.

1248
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:02,746
Wasn't it?

1249
01:18:05,874 --> 01:18:07,792
Hey.

1250
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:10,462
What's happening, partner?

1251
01:18:10,670 --> 01:18:12,297
What's cooking, boss?

1252
01:18:14,382 --> 01:18:17,344
Isn't this one
of Victor Sweet's spots?

1253
01:18:18,553 --> 01:18:20,513
Yeah, I heard that.

1254
01:18:21,306 --> 01:18:23,266
So what?

1255
01:18:25,018 --> 01:18:28,188
So why ain't you tell me
that you had talked to Evelyn Mercer

1256
01:18:28,355 --> 01:18:30,649
a week before she got killed?

1257
01:18:30,857 --> 01:18:33,902
I mean, don't you think that that's
relevant to a murder investigation?

1258
01:18:34,861 --> 01:18:36,404
I didn't tell you

1259
01:18:36,613 --> 01:18:39,366
because it wasn't relevant at all.

1260
01:18:39,866 --> 01:18:41,868
- Really?
- Yeah, I talked to the old lady...

1261
01:18:43,036 --> 01:18:44,871
...for all of about five minutes.

1262
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:46,956
She came in with her usual medley.

1263
01:18:47,165 --> 01:18:49,417
Kids tagging up her block,
that kind of shit.

1264
01:18:55,131 --> 01:18:57,300
You know, I figured
it was something like that.

1265
01:18:57,509 --> 01:18:59,636
But you still should have
said something to me, man.

1266
01:18:59,844 --> 01:19:01,596
Sorry.

1267
01:19:02,639 --> 01:19:04,307
Did she file a police report?

1268
01:19:04,516 --> 01:19:07,352
No. I sent it over
to the Parks Department.

1269
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:09,896
They clean that shit up.

1270
01:19:10,230 --> 01:19:13,316
- Five minutes, huh?
- Yeah.

1271
01:19:13,525 --> 01:19:15,986
Couldn't have been
much more than that.

1272
01:19:19,197 --> 01:19:21,449
You wanna take a shot?
You're gonna need some practice.

1273
01:19:22,409 --> 01:19:24,369
I'd love to.

1274
01:19:31,876 --> 01:19:35,171
It's been a long time
since I played a game like this one.

1275
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:38,258
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

1276
01:19:44,723 --> 01:19:47,851
Partner, I think your stick is crooked.

1277
01:19:48,143 --> 01:19:50,312
I think it's all right.

1278
01:19:52,439 --> 01:19:54,024
And the weight is off.

1279
01:19:54,607 --> 01:19:56,318
Worked pretty good for me.

1280
01:19:58,028 --> 01:19:59,696
You sure?

1281
01:20:00,530 --> 01:20:02,115
Yeah.

1282
01:20:07,954 --> 01:20:09,998
You is a dirty cop!

1283
01:20:10,206 --> 01:20:11,499
Give me your badge.

1284
01:20:11,708 --> 01:20:14,044
See, I hate dirty cops.

1285
01:20:16,212 --> 01:20:17,964
Green, wait.

1286
01:20:22,052 --> 01:20:24,137
Green, wait!
There is something I forgot.

1287
01:20:24,346 --> 01:20:26,139
What? What the fuck
you wanna say to me?

1288
01:20:30,101 --> 01:20:32,562
I forgot they installed those
surveillance cameras in the station.

1289
01:20:32,771 --> 01:20:34,939
Motherfucker!

1290
01:20:59,255 --> 01:21:02,175
Officer down! Officer down!
Green's been shot!

1291
01:21:02,384 --> 01:21:06,137
I'm in the alleyway behind
John R and Seven Mile!

1292
01:21:06,346 --> 01:21:09,975
Suspects are two young black males
heading east on foot!

1293
01:21:10,183 --> 01:21:12,811
Request backup immediately!

1294
01:21:15,605 --> 01:21:18,358
Ready! Aim! Fire!

1295
01:21:19,818 --> 01:21:23,697
Ready! Aim! Fire!

1296
01:21:23,863 --> 01:21:26,741
Ready! Aim! Fire!

1297
01:21:33,748 --> 01:21:35,500
Jackie.

1298
01:21:49,306 --> 01:21:51,725
Never should have came home.

1299
01:21:53,018 --> 01:21:55,228
Never should have came.

1300
01:22:06,865 --> 01:22:09,284
I miss him too.

1301
01:22:10,118 --> 01:22:11,494
We won't be able to bring him back,

1302
01:22:11,703 --> 01:22:13,580
but we're gonna send him
some company.

1303
01:22:13,788 --> 01:22:17,876
You can't go to war with Victor Sweet.
Not straight up.

1304
01:22:18,168 --> 01:22:21,838
He'll just hire more and more
goons until we are all dead.

1305
01:22:22,881 --> 01:22:24,549
I don't know.

1306
01:22:24,758 --> 01:22:27,260
I don't know what to do anymore.

1307
01:22:28,261 --> 01:22:30,597
I already lost one brother.
You guys are all I got.

1308
01:22:35,602 --> 01:22:37,604
- I got an idea.
- What?

1309
01:22:38,730 --> 01:22:41,232
We'll take the rest of the money
from Mom's insurance,

1310
01:22:41,441 --> 01:22:43,568
pay Sweet to call off the dogs.

1311
01:22:43,777 --> 01:22:46,821
- He'll deal. He's a businessman.
- It doesn't count as a plan

1312
01:22:47,030 --> 01:22:49,282
if it takes you longer to say it
than it does to think it up.

1313
01:22:49,491 --> 01:22:51,618
Yeah, Jerry.
Sweet will meet up with you,

1314
01:22:51,826 --> 01:22:53,370
take your money.

1315
01:22:53,578 --> 01:22:55,914
Won't be able to find your body
till the river thaws.

1316
01:22:56,456 --> 01:22:58,583
If you can get that far.

1317
01:23:11,721 --> 01:23:13,181
Jesus, Jeremiah,
what you doing here?

1318
01:23:13,390 --> 01:23:15,100
I'm here to do a little
collective bargaining.

1319
01:23:15,308 --> 01:23:17,519
What, with Sweet?
Did you not get the message?

1320
01:23:19,813 --> 01:23:22,023
He wants blood.

1321
01:23:22,232 --> 01:23:24,192
- That's not negotiable.
- Look, they told us

1322
01:23:24,401 --> 01:23:27,946
we'd never get $30 an hour on the job
either, right? But what we get?

1323
01:23:28,154 --> 01:23:30,240
So don't tell me this is not possible.
Come on, man.

1324
01:23:30,448 --> 01:23:32,158
So, what you bringing to the table?

1325
01:23:34,661 --> 01:23:36,371
Four hundred thousand dollars.

1326
01:23:41,876 --> 01:23:43,461
Yo.

1327
01:23:44,296 --> 01:23:46,798
- Evan called Sweet. He's going for it.
- So when's the meet?

1328
01:23:47,007 --> 01:23:48,383
- Four o'clock.
- Today?

1329
01:23:48,591 --> 01:23:49,843
- Yeah.
- That's in three hours.

1330
01:23:50,051 --> 01:23:51,803
Well, we ain't got no choice!

1331
01:23:52,012 --> 01:23:54,556
Sweet's supposed to roll up on us
any minute now.

1332
01:23:54,764 --> 01:23:56,808
What? What else?

1333
01:23:58,601 --> 01:24:01,187
Well, Evan, we cool.
And he let me in on a little something.

1334
01:24:01,396 --> 01:24:03,440
If Fowler's there, he don't
think he's gonna go for it.

1335
01:24:03,648 --> 01:24:07,110
- So there's no plan!
- Yes, there is, Bobby.

1336
01:24:07,319 --> 01:24:09,195
We need to take Fowler out
before the meet.

1337
01:24:09,362 --> 01:24:11,448
We can't kill a cop
even if he is dirty.

1338
01:24:11,656 --> 01:24:15,201
He handed Ma to Sweet, okay?
He ain't walking away from this.

1339
01:24:27,797 --> 01:24:30,592
Make sure the hole's cut
when we get there.

1340
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,219
Hey, come here.

1341
01:24:33,803 --> 01:24:36,765
- All right. I love you.
- Now, don't get shot.

1342
01:24:36,973 --> 01:24:38,308
- Don't shoot anyone either.
- Relax.

1343
01:24:38,516 --> 01:24:40,185
Unless you have to.

1344
01:24:40,727 --> 01:24:43,730
Come on, now.
You know I love you, don't you?

1345
01:24:47,233 --> 01:24:50,570
Y'all be good now.
And take care of Mommy, all right?

1346
01:24:56,451 --> 01:24:58,370
Be careful.

1347
01:24:58,870 --> 01:25:00,664
I will.

1348
01:25:01,539 --> 01:25:03,291
Bobby.

1349
01:25:08,338 --> 01:25:10,632
Look, I know I don't
know you that well,

1350
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:14,719
but don't you let him get hurt.
You bring him back to me.

1351
01:25:15,095 --> 01:25:16,471
I will, Camille.

1352
01:25:17,639 --> 01:25:18,932
It's gonna be okay.

1353
01:25:29,567 --> 01:25:31,444
Hey, kid!

1354
01:25:31,778 --> 01:25:34,114
What you doing,
playing out here in the snow?

1355
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:37,492
I'm just working on my swing
for the spring.

1356
01:25:37,951 --> 01:25:40,328
Hey, man, I need a big favor.

1357
01:25:40,537 --> 01:25:44,582
I'll give you $20
and this whole box of Baby Ruths.

1358
01:25:48,503 --> 01:25:50,714
You see that house over there?

1359
01:26:03,059 --> 01:26:05,103
Not till we hear from Angel.

1360
01:26:22,579 --> 01:26:24,789
- What do you want?
- I'm selling candy to raise money

1361
01:26:24,998 --> 01:26:28,710
for my baseball team. We wanna
buy new uniforms and equip...

1362
01:26:28,918 --> 01:26:29,336
Thanks. Now get the hell out of here.

1363
01:26:29,336 --> 01:26:31,087
Thanks. Now get the hell out of here.

1364
01:26:33,298 --> 01:26:37,302
This is a big problem.
A big problem for you.

1365
01:26:39,262 --> 01:26:41,514
Even a completely calm person
will suffocate

1366
01:26:41,681 --> 01:26:43,933
in four minutes without oxygen.

1367
01:26:44,142 --> 01:26:46,519
And you're not exactly calm,
are you?

1368
01:26:46,686 --> 01:26:49,564
- Jerry!
- Fuck!

1369
01:26:49,773 --> 01:26:51,191
We ain't going nowhere
without the call,

1370
01:26:51,399 --> 01:26:52,984
- so just calm down.
- What the fuck you...?

1371
01:26:53,860 --> 01:26:56,655
- Jerry!
- Just keep stalling him.

1372
01:26:56,863 --> 01:26:59,491
Hold... I'm grabbing my scarf, man.
I'll be there in a minute! Hold on.

1373
01:26:59,699 --> 01:27:01,409
- Angel?
- Hey, I got him.

1374
01:27:01,618 --> 01:27:03,578
- Is he out of the way?
- What, you wanna ask him?

1375
01:27:03,787 --> 01:27:06,498
- Let me hear his voice.
- Hold on, let me put him on. Hold on.

1376
01:27:06,706 --> 01:27:09,042
Hey, man, say hi to my brother.

1377
01:27:09,834 --> 01:27:11,378
- We got you now, bitch.
- I'm coming.

1378
01:27:11,586 --> 01:27:13,213
Go.

1379
01:27:15,423 --> 01:27:17,926
Jerry, what the hell? You in there?

1380
01:27:23,515 --> 01:27:26,643
- That's our money?
- Yeah.

1381
01:27:30,438 --> 01:27:31,564
- Hey, man, hey!
- Relax, relax.

1382
01:27:31,773 --> 01:27:34,734
- Hey, what is this, man? What is this?
- Relax, relax. Just relax.

1383
01:27:34,901 --> 01:27:38,738
We just gotta check it out, make
sure you ain't strapped. Relax, relax.

1384
01:27:38,947 --> 01:27:40,740
- He's good.
- Okay.

1385
01:27:40,949 --> 01:27:43,118
Let's take a ride, Jerry.

1386
01:27:50,417 --> 01:27:54,004
Yeah, yeah, I got it.
Well, he's onboard, boss.

1387
01:27:54,587 --> 01:27:56,464
Yeah, all right.

1388
01:27:58,008 --> 01:27:59,259
What did he say?

1389
01:27:59,467 --> 01:28:03,555
He say, "Hurry the fuck up."
Then he hung up.

1390
01:28:06,725 --> 01:28:09,811
You'll never get the belt. Trust me.

1391
01:28:15,025 --> 01:28:16,776
People never think to go for the bag.

1392
01:28:16,985 --> 01:28:18,987
It's always the belt first
for some reason.

1393
01:28:19,195 --> 01:28:22,532
The bag has to be clear, though.
Black doesn't work.

1394
01:28:25,910 --> 01:28:27,203
Get up.

1395
01:28:27,829 --> 01:28:28,872
Get over there right now.

1396
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:32,500
- He's gonna end up dead.
- Ma'am, ma'am, slow it down a gear.

1397
01:28:32,709 --> 01:28:35,879
And this isn't even his fight.
It's his stupid brother's fault!

1398
01:28:36,087 --> 01:28:37,756
I understand. I can help you.

1399
01:28:37,964 --> 01:28:40,508
But you're gonna have to let
me know who it is we're talking about

1400
01:28:40,717 --> 01:28:43,261
- and what's about to happen.
- My boyfriend.

1401
01:28:44,095 --> 01:28:47,474
He was talking about killing a cop.

1402
01:29:20,382 --> 01:29:22,884
You hear that?
You know what that is?

1403
01:29:23,093 --> 01:29:25,637
That's a damn beautiful sound.

1404
01:29:25,845 --> 01:29:27,847
Those are my boys coming.

1405
01:29:56,793 --> 01:29:59,045
So, what do we do now?

1406
01:29:59,921 --> 01:30:01,756
We get out.

1407
01:30:07,137 --> 01:30:10,015
Jesus Christ! What is that?
Wha...? What's that?

1408
01:30:10,223 --> 01:30:14,227
It's ice fishing.
Tommy there is part Eskimo.

1409
01:30:27,741 --> 01:30:29,367
No.

1410
01:30:32,579 --> 01:30:34,164
It's not looking good
for you, homeboy.

1411
01:30:34,581 --> 01:30:36,624
We'll see if they're still your boys
after they find out

1412
01:30:36,833 --> 01:30:39,919
you killed your partner Green,
homeboy.

1413
01:30:40,420 --> 01:30:41,921
That's your angle, huh?

1414
01:30:42,130 --> 01:30:45,425
You gonna walk out there
and tell them I killed Green.

1415
01:30:47,010 --> 01:30:48,595
That's your story?

1416
01:30:48,803 --> 01:30:51,264
- It has the advantage of being true.
- So what?

1417
01:30:52,265 --> 01:30:54,476
I killed my partner.

1418
01:30:55,685 --> 01:30:57,937
I could kill the whole
damn police department

1419
01:30:58,146 --> 01:30:59,606
if you were the only witness.

1420
01:31:00,231 --> 01:31:02,233
They'd probably just
promote me to chief.

1421
01:31:02,442 --> 01:31:06,446
You're one of
the Mercer brothers, brother.

1422
01:31:06,655 --> 01:31:09,824
No cop in the world's gonna
believe your word over mine. Sorry.

1423
01:31:10,033 --> 01:31:12,452
You know what?
You're probably right.

1424
01:31:12,661 --> 01:31:15,455
Other than the ones
I got outside right now in the van

1425
01:31:15,664 --> 01:31:18,625
listening to every bit
of our conversation...

1426
01:31:19,250 --> 01:31:21,002
...brother.

1427
01:31:22,045 --> 01:31:23,129
You're lying.

1428
01:31:24,547 --> 01:31:25,966
Afraid not.

1429
01:31:29,260 --> 01:31:30,637
Take a look.

1430
01:31:31,304 --> 01:31:32,764
I want eyes on the house!

1431
01:31:32,973 --> 01:31:35,809
Okay, lieutenant, I'm bringing
him out now.

1432
01:31:36,017 --> 01:31:38,645
Come on, man. It's all over.

1433
01:31:44,484 --> 01:31:46,820
I'm gonna pop your head
like a champagne cork.

1434
01:31:46,987 --> 01:31:49,489
You hear me?
I'm taking your clown down with me!

1435
01:32:21,980 --> 01:32:24,357
Fool showed up.

1436
01:32:24,774 --> 01:32:28,069
And they say there's no such thing
as a free lunch.

1437
01:32:32,824 --> 01:32:34,159
All right.

1438
01:32:34,367 --> 01:32:37,329
Let's sink this dumb-ass
and get out of here.

1439
01:32:37,537 --> 01:32:40,540
I got a candlelit date lined up with
a hot piece of Puerto Rican pussy.

1440
01:32:51,009 --> 01:32:54,054
Jeremiah Mercer. Businessman.

1441
01:32:55,388 --> 01:32:57,474
Give me that.

1442
01:33:09,194 --> 01:33:12,405
Goddamn it, I like the way
you do business!

1443
01:33:13,573 --> 01:33:15,450
You're a reasonable man.

1444
01:33:15,659 --> 01:33:17,661
You should have let me in
on your project.

1445
01:33:17,869 --> 01:33:19,829
We could have been partners.

1446
01:33:20,038 --> 01:33:23,500
Could have been a sweet deal
for both of us.

1447
01:33:23,708 --> 01:33:25,835
Now it just a sweet deal for me.

1448
01:33:26,044 --> 01:33:28,630
Come on, man.
We gonna do business, or what?

1449
01:33:30,674 --> 01:33:32,342
Right.

1450
01:33:35,053 --> 01:33:37,430
Right. Right.

1451
01:33:37,639 --> 01:33:38,682
Down to business.

1452
01:33:39,265 --> 01:33:41,101
What were the...?

1453
01:33:41,267 --> 01:33:42,894
What were the terms again?

1454
01:33:44,312 --> 01:33:45,814
You give me 400 grand,

1455
01:33:46,314 --> 01:33:50,151
and I pardon you and your brothers,
is that right? Forgive and forget, right?

1456
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:51,403
That's right.

1457
01:33:51,945 --> 01:33:54,280
My brothers said I was naive.
That you would shoot me

1458
01:33:54,489 --> 01:33:56,866
and just take the money. Yeah.

1459
01:33:58,660 --> 01:34:01,121
- Damn, man, you hurt my feelings.
- Good.

1460
01:34:02,122 --> 01:34:04,624
Because you don't know shit
about hurt feelings.

1461
01:34:07,294 --> 01:34:09,838
I just buried my mama
and my brother.

1462
01:34:10,046 --> 01:34:12,299
And I think that's
payment enough, Vic.

1463
01:34:13,633 --> 01:34:16,052
You been doing a lot
of thinking, boy.

1464
01:34:16,886 --> 01:34:19,389
Yeah, my mama raised me
to be a thinking man.

1465
01:34:19,597 --> 01:34:21,850
So me and my brothers, we came up
with a whole new proposal.

1466
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:26,396
- A whole new proposal. Is that right?
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

1467
01:34:26,604 --> 01:34:29,858
You gonna like it too. Because it is a...
A sweet deal.

1468
01:34:30,608 --> 01:34:33,820
Check it out. Instead of giving you
the 400 grand, we decided

1469
01:34:34,029 --> 01:34:36,865
we'd give it to these mistreated
workers you got standing behind you.

1470
01:34:38,533 --> 01:34:39,659
Pistol.

1471
01:34:40,660 --> 01:34:43,413
- Evan, I said pistol!
- No, bitch.

1472
01:34:43,621 --> 01:34:46,583
The one thing you forgot
about me is this:

1473
01:34:46,791 --> 01:34:49,794
I was in the union for a long time.

1474
01:34:50,253 --> 01:34:53,006
I ain't never missed no meetings.

1475
01:34:53,506 --> 01:34:54,674
He ain't lying.

1476
01:34:55,300 --> 01:34:57,510
It's cold out here when you
by yourself, ain't it?

1477
01:35:01,973 --> 01:35:04,017
So, what now?

1478
01:35:06,061 --> 01:35:09,022
You gonna kill the hand
that's been feeding you?

1479
01:35:10,231 --> 01:35:13,610
- Over some stupid old lady?
- Watch your motherfucking mouth.

1480
01:35:14,402 --> 01:35:16,112
You dumb shits!

1481
01:35:19,699 --> 01:35:24,412
I told Fowler and his pals
all about this meeting!

1482
01:35:25,205 --> 01:35:28,875
You kill me, you all go down!
Murder!

1483
01:35:30,752 --> 01:35:32,337
He's already late.

1484
01:35:32,545 --> 01:35:34,422
Shit, he's probably on his way
right now.

1485
01:35:35,507 --> 01:35:36,800
He ain't coming.

1486
01:35:39,135 --> 01:35:42,389
- Come out!
- I swear to God, I'll kill him!

1487
01:35:44,140 --> 01:35:46,059
You guys set me up, huh?

1488
01:35:46,476 --> 01:35:50,021
You think you're real smart,
getting this shit on tape, huh?

1489
01:35:50,230 --> 01:35:51,523
- Fowler?
- What the hell?

1490
01:35:51,731 --> 01:35:54,109
- I thought Fowler was the hostage.
- Back off! I'm serious!

1491
01:35:54,317 --> 01:35:56,945
- Fowler, what are you doing, man?
- Drop the goddamn gun!

1492
01:35:57,153 --> 01:35:59,406
- We're here to help you!
- Back off now! I'm serious!

1493
01:35:59,614 --> 01:36:02,075
That's right.
Fowler, put down your weapon!

1494
01:36:02,283 --> 01:36:03,326
Not a chance!

1495
01:36:04,411 --> 01:36:06,329
I said, back off! Now!

1496
01:36:08,707 --> 01:36:09,916
Drop your weapon!

1497
01:36:15,297 --> 01:36:17,215
He's down!

1498
01:36:17,757 --> 01:36:20,093
Man down! Man down! EMS!

1499
01:36:20,927 --> 01:36:22,429
- Call it in!
- Get on the horn!

1500
01:36:27,851 --> 01:36:29,519
Come on now.
Who's gonna do it, huh?

1501
01:36:31,187 --> 01:36:33,690
Who the man here, huh?

1502
01:36:33,898 --> 01:36:36,609
Which one of you tough guys
gonna do it?

1503
01:36:37,485 --> 01:36:41,448
Who's gonna take on the champ?
You, Charlie?

1504
01:37:01,092 --> 01:37:02,886
Yeah. That's right.

1505
01:37:03,428 --> 01:37:05,472
Is this who I think it is?

1506
01:37:07,098 --> 01:37:09,684
Is this what you all been waiting on?

1507
01:37:09,893 --> 01:37:11,561
- You all right, Jerry?
- Yeah, I'm straight.

1508
01:37:11,770 --> 01:37:15,398
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, Bobby Mercer.

1509
01:37:16,149 --> 01:37:17,359
Back in town.

1510
01:37:17,567 --> 01:37:19,319
- You gonna be the one, man?
- Come on, Bobby.

1511
01:37:19,486 --> 01:37:21,154
Bring it on, baby. What you got?

1512
01:37:21,905 --> 01:37:23,573
Watch his hands, Bobby.

1513
01:37:23,782 --> 01:37:25,617
You better say a prayer, man.

1514
01:37:26,951 --> 01:37:28,745
- Get him, champ.
- Come on!

1515
01:37:29,287 --> 01:37:30,705
Kick his ass! Kick his ass!

1516
01:37:30,914 --> 01:37:33,166
Come on, kick his ass!

1517
01:37:33,375 --> 01:37:35,710
- Come on, that's it! Come on!
- Hit him hard! Bobby, hit him!

1518
01:37:40,632 --> 01:37:43,802
- Get your ass up! Come on!
- Get him!

1519
01:37:44,010 --> 01:37:47,222
- All right, you got him! You got him!
- Put that shit away, man. Come on.

1520
01:37:47,430 --> 01:37:48,723
Yeah, come on, man!

1521
01:37:54,854 --> 01:37:56,356
Take him out, boy!

1522
01:38:00,151 --> 01:38:01,403
Get back. Get back.

1523
01:38:04,197 --> 01:38:06,032
That's it!

1524
01:38:09,285 --> 01:38:11,830
- Good night, man!
- That's it! All right, come on, man.

1525
01:38:12,455 --> 01:38:14,124
It's over now, Bobby.

1526
01:38:14,833 --> 01:38:17,002
- Elbow, baby, elbow!
- Turn it around, man!

1527
01:38:19,754 --> 01:38:22,299
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Get him!
Come on!

1528
01:38:25,385 --> 01:38:27,053
Fucker!

1529
01:38:27,762 --> 01:38:30,181
Hey, get up, bitch! Get up!

1530
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:34,561
- Motherfuck!
- Get your bitch ass back in there!

1531
01:38:34,728 --> 01:38:36,229
Get him back here!

1532
01:38:41,568 --> 01:38:42,819
Yeah!

1533
01:38:43,278 --> 01:38:44,446
That's what's up!

1534
01:38:57,375 --> 01:38:58,877
- Get him in the hole.
- That's right.

1535
01:38:59,085 --> 01:39:01,421
Way to go, Bobby.

1536
01:39:14,643 --> 01:39:16,061
So, what we gonna do
about the police?

1537
01:39:16,269 --> 01:39:17,270
Police?

1538
01:39:17,479 --> 01:39:19,522
Cops love the Mercers, Jerry.

1539
01:39:20,690 --> 01:39:23,318
- Sit him down.
- Damn! You girls are trying to kill me!

1540
01:39:23,526 --> 01:39:25,278
What are you doing, man? All right!

1541
01:39:26,279 --> 01:39:27,614
You wanna go another round, huh?

1542
01:39:27,781 --> 01:39:30,617
You arrested him,
and he didn't do anything!

1543
01:39:30,784 --> 01:39:31,868
Let me ask you again.

1544
01:39:32,077 --> 01:39:33,953
What happened to Victor Sweet,
Mercer?

1545
01:39:34,162 --> 01:39:36,289
His name is Jeremiah Mercer,
and I wanna see him now!

1546
01:39:36,498 --> 01:39:38,708
Ellis, you might wanna close your ears.
This is nasty shit.

1547
01:39:38,917 --> 01:39:42,462
That's what you wanna hear? I did it.
I did it, okay?

1548
01:39:42,671 --> 01:39:44,297
If you did it,
then I wanna hear you say it!

1549
01:39:44,506 --> 01:39:47,467
From about 5:30 p.m. Till
about 11 or so last night,

1550
01:39:47,634 --> 01:39:51,513
I was banging that pretty little wife
of yours, okay? Here's the...

1551
01:39:54,307 --> 01:39:57,602
I was bumping uglies with your wife.

1552
01:39:58,103 --> 01:40:00,563
Your mama, she wasn't good
the first time.

1553
01:40:01,022 --> 01:40:03,483
- That true? What do you got now?
- Your hair, scumbag!

1554
01:40:03,692 --> 01:40:05,986
Taken off Victor Sweet's dead body.

1555
01:40:08,822 --> 01:40:11,324
Don't push him like that!

1556
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:13,493
Oh, baby! Oh, my God!

1557
01:40:14,119 --> 01:40:15,870
Are you okay?

1558
01:40:16,079 --> 01:40:18,123
- I'm okay, baby.
- They bought it, baby.

1559
01:40:18,331 --> 01:40:20,083
- They bought it.
- Let me see. Come here.

1560
01:40:20,291 --> 01:40:21,376
- It's all right.
- Let me see.

1561
01:40:21,584 --> 01:40:23,378
- It's just a boo-boo.
- It's not just a boo-boo!

1562
01:40:23,586 --> 01:40:25,088
Somebody put their fist in your eye!

1563
01:40:25,297 --> 01:40:26,756
- Let me see it!
- Come on, now.

1564
01:40:26,965 --> 01:40:28,341
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

1565
01:40:28,508 --> 01:40:31,428
- Oh, my God. You're bleeding, baby.
- You know I can take a punch.

1566
01:40:31,636 --> 01:40:33,930
I know you can take a punch.

1567
01:40:34,139 --> 01:40:37,517
- You don't talk about peoples mamas!
- Well, he talked about mine.

1568
01:40:37,684 --> 01:40:40,353
- Did you get some licks in?
- Of course.

1569
01:40:40,562 --> 01:40:43,565
- Does his eye look like yours?
- Hey, man, where's Bobby?

1570
01:40:43,773 --> 01:40:45,608
Let me catch you on the street
without that badge.

1571
01:40:45,817 --> 01:40:47,319
I'll smack that smirk
off your face, punk!

1572
01:40:47,527 --> 01:40:51,281
I'm gonna smack you, Bobby.
I told you not to let Jerry get hurt.

1573
01:40:51,489 --> 01:40:52,490
He's breathing.

1574
01:40:52,699 --> 01:40:54,826
- You all right, Jerry?
- I'm all right, man.

1575
01:40:55,035 --> 01:40:57,370
Let me get my property.

1576
01:40:58,872 --> 01:41:01,791
- Man, you all right?
- I'm good.

1577
01:41:03,376 --> 01:41:04,961
You said something,
didn't you, Jerry?

1578
01:41:05,170 --> 01:41:06,338
I did not say nothing, man.

1579
01:41:06,546 --> 01:41:08,006
- Why you always...?
- I did.

1580
01:41:08,214 --> 01:41:11,593
- What you say?
- I told him I was banging his wife.

1581
01:41:13,386 --> 01:41:15,639
- Come on, man!
- I did too.

1582
01:41:15,847 --> 01:41:17,849
Me too.

1583
01:41:19,184 --> 01:41:21,686
Okay, pass the ball, guys!
Pass the ball.

1584
01:41:24,898 --> 01:41:27,150
Yeah, yeah. I got you, I got you.

1585
01:41:29,319 --> 01:41:31,321
Guys, right here, right here.

1586
01:41:56,930 --> 01:41:59,432
Got one window in.

1587
01:42:00,433 --> 01:42:04,270
All right. Let's keep it going,
come on.

1588
01:42:08,650 --> 01:42:10,860
Okay, okay. No more work for today.

1589
01:42:11,069 --> 01:42:14,447
That's right. Come in the house.
Wash your hands.

1590
01:42:15,365 --> 01:42:17,826
- Dang! A little to eat.
- Time to eat. I'm starving.

1591
01:42:18,034 --> 01:42:19,160
What did you cook?

1592
01:42:19,369 --> 01:42:21,287
You too, girls, come on.

1593
01:42:21,454 --> 01:42:23,540
Come on, babies.

1594
01:42:37,262 --> 01:42:39,055
Here you go.

1595
01:42:39,264 --> 01:42:41,266
Evelyn isn't coming back, is she?

1596
01:42:42,225 --> 01:42:44,269
No, she's not coming back.

1597
01:42:44,477 --> 01:42:46,813
Because she's dead, huh?

1598
01:42:48,398 --> 01:42:51,568
Yeah. It's because she's dead.

1599
01:42:52,402 --> 01:42:54,821
You guys have fun, all right?
No rough stuff.

1600
01:43:02,871 --> 01:43:06,583
Always so good to have
you back home, son.

1601
01:43:07,167 --> 01:43:09,794
You gonna stick around
a little while this time?

1602
01:43:10,920 --> 01:43:14,257
I'm thinking about it, Ma.
I'm thinking about it.

1603
01:43:16,551 --> 01:43:19,137
Oh, Bobby.

1604
01:44:01,554 --> 01:44:03,390
- Mercer!
- Yeah, Bobby!

1605
01:44:05,266 --> 01:44:08,895
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1606
01:44:09,104 --> 01:44:10,730
Yeah!

1607
01:44:13,900 --> 01:44:16,528
Come on, now. Come on.
Did you have to push?

1608
01:44:16,736 --> 01:44:18,571
Hold up! Hold up!

1609
01:44:18,738 --> 01:44:21,700
If we don't work, nobody work!
Get back!

1610
01:44:32,377 --> 01:44:35,672
I'm sorry, Mr. Wong, your credit card
has been reported stolen.

1611
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:38,550
Stolen? Madam, you know what,
them my uncles right there.

1612
01:44:38,758 --> 01:44:43,471
- Tyrone Wong, help me out real quick.
- Mr. Wong! Mr. Wong! Mr. Wong!

1613
01:45:02,282 --> 01:45:05,410
You keep sayin'
The world is gonna end

1614
01:45:05,618 --> 01:45:09,331
You keep sayin'
The world is gonna end

1615
01:45:10,305 --> 01:45:16,599
