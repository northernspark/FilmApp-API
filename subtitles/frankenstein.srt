1
00:00:04,287 --> 00:00:07,006
The formally attired gentleman
is Edward Van Sloan,

2
00:00:07,087 --> 00:00:09,885
who plays Doctor Waldman
in Frankenstein.

3
00:00:09,967 --> 00:00:12,640
Here he is out of character
to introduce the film.

4
00:00:12,727 --> 00:00:17,243
Van Sloan had closed the Bela Lugosi
Dracula film in a similar manner.

5
00:00:17,327 --> 00:00:21,639
This was an added scene, photographed
long after the film completed production,

6
00:00:21,727 --> 00:00:24,764
in anticipation of objections
from religious groups

7
00:00:24,847 --> 00:00:27,839
over the theme of divine presumption.

8
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:32,205
Staff Universal screenwriter at the time,
John Huston, wrote earlier drafts

9
00:00:32,287 --> 00:00:37,805
that included lines such as "Frightful,
supremely frightful, would be the effect

10
00:00:37,887 --> 00:00:43,166
of any human endeavour to mock the
stupendous mechanism of the creator."

11
00:00:43,247 --> 00:00:46,125
Scenario editor Richard Schayer
wrote another version,

12
00:00:46,207 --> 00:00:50,200
which includes material used
in the speech now being given:

13
00:00:50,287 --> 00:00:54,758
"Here we unfold the portentous record
of Frankenstein, man of science,

14
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:59,875
who sought to create a man in
his own image, not reckoning upon God."

15
00:00:59,967 --> 00:01:01,639
This is Rudy Behlmer speaking.

16
00:01:01,727 --> 00:01:05,515
The main title is presented
in a properly misterioso manner.

17
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,438
The music is an original composition

18
00:01:07,527 --> 00:01:10,963
written for the picture
by film composer Bernhard Kaun.

19
00:01:11,047 --> 00:01:14,960
Other than the end-title music,
it is the only scoring used in the picture.

20
00:01:15,047 --> 00:01:17,197
This was typical for 1931.

21
00:01:17,287 --> 00:01:22,236
Background scoring throughout a film did
not become accepted practice until later.

22
00:01:22,327 --> 00:01:24,716
The writing credits
may seem a bit complicated:

23
00:01:24,807 --> 00:01:28,766
"Based upon the composition", "From
the novel", "Adapted from the play",

24
00:01:28,847 --> 00:01:33,318
"Screen Play", "Scenario Editor"...
All this will be sorted out.

25
00:01:35,647 --> 00:01:40,562
Then, of course, a single card
for director James Whale.

26
00:01:41,647 --> 00:01:46,482
Notice "The Monster" is only identified
by a question mark in the cast list.

27
00:01:46,567 --> 00:01:52,244
This was reminiscent of the very first
stage production of Frankenstein in 1823.

28
00:01:52,327 --> 00:01:57,447
The character of the monster was billed
only with a question mark at that time.

29
00:02:00,567 --> 00:02:05,083
Originally, this opening sequence
began with a distant shot in profile

30
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,840
of the funeral procession going up the hill.

31
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:09,918
This was dropped during editing,

32
00:02:10,007 --> 00:02:14,956
but appeared briefly during the flashback
sequence in The Bride of Frankenstein.

33
00:02:15,727 --> 00:02:18,799
The panning shot of mourners
ends by a statue...

34
00:02:20,327 --> 00:02:23,956
and the statue is of the Grim Reaper.

35
00:02:30,207 --> 00:02:34,644
Here we are introduced to Henry
Frankenstein, played by Colin Clive,

36
00:02:34,727 --> 00:02:37,685
and his assistant, played by Dwight Frye.

37
00:02:37,767 --> 00:02:40,520
This sequence does not derive
from the novel,

38
00:02:40,607 --> 00:02:44,043
nor does it derive from any of
the play adaptations that followed.

39
00:02:44,127 --> 00:02:47,199
But the novel that spawned
the Frankenstein phenomenon

40
00:02:47,287 --> 00:02:49,243
was radically different in many ways

41
00:02:49,327 --> 00:02:54,276
from the countless dramatisations
that followed on stage and screen.

42
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:58,565
When did this saga
of Frankenstein begin?

43
00:02:58,647 --> 00:03:03,038
It started on a stormy night, June 1816,

44
00:03:03,127 --> 00:03:06,881
with a 19-year-old woman
who was lying half-awake in a villa

45
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:09,800
on the shores of Lake Léman
in Switzerland.

46
00:03:09,887 --> 00:03:14,642
Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin was staying
there with her lover, later her husband,

47
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:16,445
the poet Shelley.

48
00:03:16,527 --> 00:03:20,520
Together with their neighbour Lord Byron,
his physician, Doctor Polidori,

49
00:03:20,607 --> 00:03:22,484
and Mary's stepsister Claire,

50
00:03:22,567 --> 00:03:27,357
they would often gather on chilly, wet
evenings and read ghost stories aloud.

51
00:03:29,007 --> 00:03:33,637
One evening Byron suggested
they each try their hand at writing a story,

52
00:03:33,727 --> 00:03:35,797
a story of the supernatural.

53
00:03:35,887 --> 00:03:40,677
On another night, Mary heard an intense
conversation between Shelley and Byron

54
00:03:40,767 --> 00:03:43,964
concerning the nature
of the principle of life,

55
00:03:44,047 --> 00:03:47,756
and whether it might ever be
discovered and communicated.

56
00:03:47,847 --> 00:03:50,839
According to Mary,
the talk went on to include speculation

57
00:03:50,927 --> 00:03:53,999
that perhaps a corpse
could be reanimated,

58
00:03:54,087 --> 00:03:57,966
perhaps the component parts
of a creature might be manufactured,

59
00:03:58,047 --> 00:04:01,642
brought together
and imbued with vital warmth.

60
00:04:02,447 --> 00:04:05,519
After going to bed, she later wrote

61
00:04:05,607 --> 00:04:09,043
"I did not sleep,
nor could I be said to think."

62
00:04:09,127 --> 00:04:12,517
"I saw - with shut eyes,
but acute mental vision -

63
00:04:12,607 --> 00:04:15,519
I saw the pale student of unhallowed arts

64
00:04:15,607 --> 00:04:18,963
kneeling beside the thing
he had put together."

65
00:04:19,047 --> 00:04:23,757
And here's Frankenstein literally
throwing dirt on the face of death.

66
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:27,442
"I saw the hideous phantasm
of a man stretched out,

67
00:04:27,527 --> 00:04:33,796
and then, on the working of some
powerful engine, show signs of life

68
00:04:33,887 --> 00:04:37,197
and stir with an uneasy, half-vital motion."

69
00:04:37,287 --> 00:04:40,438
"His success would terrify the artist."

70
00:04:40,527 --> 00:04:44,964
"He would rush away from
his odious handiwork horror-stricken."

71
00:04:45,047 --> 00:04:50,360
"I could not so easily get rid of my
hideous phantom - still it haunted me."

72
00:04:50,447 --> 00:04:54,235
"On the morrow, I announced
that I had thought of a story."

73
00:04:56,807 --> 00:05:00,004
Shelley encouraged her
to develop and expand the material.

74
00:05:00,087 --> 00:05:03,159
He also helped her to edit
the manuscript as it evolved.

75
00:05:03,247 --> 00:05:09,117
21 months later, in March 1818,
Frankenstein was published.

76
00:05:09,207 --> 00:05:13,598
In 1831, Mary Shelley
revised her novel for a new edition.

77
00:05:13,687 --> 00:05:17,441
She also added an introduction,
which tells the story of its origin

78
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:22,555
and ends with Mary bidding her
"hideous progeny go forth and prosper."

79
00:05:22,647 --> 00:05:24,399
And indeed it did.

80
00:05:24,487 --> 00:05:27,445
Frankenstein is one of
the most often-reprinted novels

81
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,438
in the history of literature.

82
00:05:29,527 --> 00:05:34,362
The adaptability of the story to the theatre
was recognised immediately.

83
00:05:34,447 --> 00:05:40,920
In 1823, there were at least five
stage versions, both serious and comic.

84
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:45,637
One, Presumption; or, the Fate
of Frankenstein by Richard Peake,

85
00:05:45,727 --> 00:05:49,197
was to serve as a basic transcription
of the novel for the stage

86
00:05:49,287 --> 00:05:51,881
and a source for further elaboration.

87
00:05:51,967 --> 00:05:54,720
Action and melodrama were
the keynotes of Peake's play,

88
00:05:54,807 --> 00:05:57,321
and Frankenstein the creator
and his creature

89
00:05:57,407 --> 00:06:00,479
were presented as instant antagonists.

90
00:06:00,567 --> 00:06:04,003
There is a major creation sequence -
not in the novel -

91
00:06:04,087 --> 00:06:08,239
an assistant to Frankenstein named Fritz -
not in the novel -

92
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,966
and a non-talking monster.

93
00:06:11,047 --> 00:06:16,167
In the book, Frankenstein's creature
eventually becomes absolutely verbose,

94
00:06:16,247 --> 00:06:19,922
with an impressive vocabulary
and masterful syntax.

95
00:06:20,007 --> 00:06:25,081
His monologues run on for pages
and, on occasion, entire chapters.

96
00:06:30,447 --> 00:06:35,601
Here at the medical college we are going
to meet again actor Edward Van Sloan,

97
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:39,521
this time in character
as Doctor Waldman -

98
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:44,397
a variation on his Van Helsing role
in Universal's Dracula with Bela Lugosi

99
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:47,524
that was released earlier in 1931.

100
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:51,998
Van Sloan also played Van Helsing in the
New York stage production of Dracula,

101
00:06:52,087 --> 00:06:55,079
with Lugosi, in 1927.

102
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:56,885
Later he played Van Helsing again

103
00:06:56,967 --> 00:07:00,926
in Universal's 1936 sequel
Dracula's Daughter,

104
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:06,445
and a similar role, Professor Muller,
in The Mummy in 1932.

105
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:12,276
Van Sloan began his professional
acting career on the stage in 1910.

106
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:15,757
He worked with stock companies
in Montreal, Canada,

107
00:07:15,847 --> 00:07:17,803
and in Boston, Newark and Cleveland,

108
00:07:17,887 --> 00:07:21,243
finally reaching the New York stage
in 1923.

109
00:07:21,327 --> 00:07:25,479
All in all, he was in
approximately 150 plays.

110
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:30,766
His film career began with Dracula, but
he soon became a victim of typecasting:

111
00:07:30,847 --> 00:07:35,682
The Death Kiss, Death Takes a Holiday,
The Black Room, The Phantom Creeps,

112
00:07:35,767 --> 00:07:38,201
Before I Hang, The Monster and the Girl,

113
00:07:38,287 --> 00:07:40,323
and so on and so on.

114
00:07:40,407 --> 00:07:43,001
He died in 1964.

115
00:07:44,647 --> 00:07:48,765
The technical advisor for Waldman's
lecture was Doctor Cecil Miller,

116
00:07:48,847 --> 00:07:50,758
a brain specialist.

117
00:07:52,487 --> 00:07:56,560
The character of Fritz, played by
Dwight Frye, was not in the novel,

118
00:07:56,647 --> 00:08:01,323
but was introduced in the 1823
Richard Peake stage dramatisation.

119
00:08:01,407 --> 00:08:05,195
In early drafts of the film scripts
the character was mute,

120
00:08:05,287 --> 00:08:09,326
but it made sense to give him speech
so that Frankenstein could have dialogue

121
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:13,161
rather than talking to himself
or resorting to pantomime

122
00:08:13,247 --> 00:08:17,559
during the rather nefarious
preparatory work for the experiments.

123
00:08:17,767 --> 00:08:21,726
The about-to-be-dropped-and-shattered
"normal brain",

124
00:08:21,807 --> 00:08:25,482
followed by Fritz
taking the "criminal brain",

125
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:29,480
was a later addition to the script
by Francis Edwards Faragoh.

126
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:33,321
This element had never been used before
in novel or plays,

127
00:08:33,407 --> 00:08:37,559
and indeed took away from
the basic innocence of the monster.

128
00:08:37,647 --> 00:08:42,357
Perhaps it was felt, because of the severe
time compression necessary in the film,

129
00:08:42,447 --> 00:08:46,918
that the criminal brain would justify
the monster's early acts of violence,

130
00:08:47,007 --> 00:08:49,237
in addition to his being tormented.

Close-up of Henry Frankenstein's

133
00:09:04,607 --> 00:09:06,359
Close-up of a maid.

Close-up of guest, Victor Moritz.

135

Close-up of Henry's fiancée Elizabeth.

136
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:13,558
Then cut back to the establishing shot,

137
00:09:13,647 --> 00:09:17,117
with the top half, including chandelier,
being a matte painting.

138
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:21,405
A rather unusual way to introduce
a new sequence and new characters.

139
00:09:21,487 --> 00:09:23,364
The room in Elizabeth's home

140
00:09:23,447 --> 00:09:28,726
is a set left over from Universal's
The Cat and the Canary from 1927.

141
00:09:28,807 --> 00:09:31,844
Leading man John Boles
was given the thankless part

142
00:09:31,927 --> 00:09:34,964
of Henry's friend and Elizabeth's friend -

143
00:09:35,047 --> 00:09:38,722
although he would like to be
much more than friend to Elizabeth.

144
00:09:38,807 --> 00:09:40,638
Boles acted and sang on Broadway,

145
00:09:40,727 --> 00:09:43,480
then came to Hollywood
and starred in several musicals,

146
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:47,196
such as The Desert Song,
Rio Rita and King of Jazz,

147
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,676
revealing a rich baritone voice.

148
00:09:49,767 --> 00:09:52,520
Later he became a leading man
in screen soap operas,

149
00:09:52,607 --> 00:09:58,921
such as the 1932 Back Street, Only
Yesterday, and the 1937 Stella Dallas.

150
00:09:59,007 --> 00:10:01,601
And he was a father or father figure
to Shirley Temple

151
00:10:01,687 --> 00:10:04,201
in The Littlest Rebel and Curly Top.

152
00:10:05,127 --> 00:10:10,076
Here it is planted that Victor has strong
romantic feelings toward Elizabeth,

153
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:13,921
but, being a gentleman,
he doesn't overplay his hand,

154
00:10:14,007 --> 00:10:18,319
and for the most part stays
in control with regard to his feelings.

155
00:10:18,407 --> 00:10:23,481
Henry Henigson, a Universal executive,
early in the preparation of Frankenstein

156
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:25,797
complained to screenwriter Garrett Fort

157
00:10:25,887 --> 00:10:29,277
that the implied frustrated love affair
between Elizabeth and Victor

158
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:35,397
was "insufficient"
as relief from the horror plot.

159
00:10:35,487 --> 00:10:41,039
Fort responded "The girl is not deeply
in love with Henry and does love Victor."

160
00:10:41,127 --> 00:10:45,359
"Her wedding to Henry is the result of a
childhood arrangement between families,

161
00:10:45,447 --> 00:10:48,757
quite in keeping with the continental
conception of such matters."

162
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:51,236
"She is fond of Henry, she admires him."

163
00:10:51,327 --> 00:10:56,162
"Her emotions, when she finds him
in trouble, are not those of love, but pity."

164
00:10:56,247 --> 00:10:57,885
"She has given up Victor

165
00:10:57,967 --> 00:11:01,323
because of obligations
she feels she cannot sidestep."

166
00:11:01,647 --> 00:11:07,085
"Henry is an abnormal character.
The Victor and girl character are normal."

167
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,237
"The audience will be rooting for them,

168
00:11:09,327 --> 00:11:14,355
although, at the same time, sympathetic
to Henry because of his ill-starred love,

169
00:11:14,447 --> 00:11:17,280
wrecked because of
his absorption in science."

170
00:11:17,367 --> 00:11:20,962
"The girl, in her scenes with Henry,
will receive all the sympathy

171
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:24,244
because we realise
she is making the best of a bad bargain,

172
00:11:24,327 --> 00:11:26,887
but doing it like a thoroughbred."

173
00:11:28,727 --> 00:11:31,287
Mae Clarke,
director James Whale's leading lady

174
00:11:31,367 --> 00:11:34,643
in the recently completed
Waterloo Bridge, whom he liked,

175
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:37,878
was a natural choice
for Frankenstein's fiancée.

176
00:11:37,967 --> 00:11:43,280
She had been in film since 1929, and
before that was a dancer, actress, singer,

177
00:11:43,367 --> 00:11:47,963
appearing primarily in nightclubs,
Broadway musicals, vaudeville.

178
00:11:48,047 --> 00:11:52,518
In 1974, author Anita Loos
revealed that Clarke

179
00:11:52,607 --> 00:11:58,125
was the inspiration for her Lorelei Lee
in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes in 1926.

180
00:11:58,207 --> 00:12:03,156
"I patterned her on a cute, little blonde
HL Mencken was escorting at the time."

181
00:12:03,247 --> 00:12:08,241
"Her name was Mae Clarke.
Mencken was a beau of mine."

182
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:13,242
In The Public Enemy, also made in 1931,
Clarke was the memorable recipient

183
00:12:13,327 --> 00:12:18,276
of a half-grapefruit slapped and twisted
on her face by James Cagney.

184
00:12:18,367 --> 00:12:21,837
She was Cagney's leading lady in
two other films after The Public Enemy -

185
00:12:21,927 --> 00:12:23,918
Lady Killer and Great Guy.

186
00:12:24,007 --> 00:12:27,363
Mae had a stand-out and showy role
as Molly the prostitute

187
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:30,359
in the 1931 version of The Front Page.

188
00:12:30,447 --> 00:12:33,007
But her starring role in Waterloo Bridge,

189
00:12:33,087 --> 00:12:37,285
in which she played a woman forced to
turn to prostitution by her circumstances,

190
00:12:37,367 --> 00:12:40,837
was Clarke's favourite part -
and she is excellent in it,

191
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:44,317
delivering a performance
of extraordinary delicacy.

192
00:12:44,407 --> 00:12:48,764
Because of legal complications regarding
two remakes, one with Vivien Leigh,

193
00:12:48,847 --> 00:12:51,645
it was unavailable for viewing
for decades.

194
00:12:51,727 --> 00:12:54,287
James Whale said that on Frankenstein

195
00:12:54,367 --> 00:12:58,804
"I asked for Mae Clarke for Elizabeth
because of her intelligence, fervour

196
00:12:58,887 --> 00:13:03,756
and sincere belief that Frankenstein
would claim the public interest."

197
00:13:03,847 --> 00:13:07,726
The only other actress of record
considered for the part was Bette Davis,

198
00:13:07,807 --> 00:13:10,082
under contract to Universal
for six months.

199
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:16,766
But apparently producer Carl Laemmle Jr
did not think too highly of her sex appeal.

200
00:13:16,847 --> 00:13:20,237
After Frankenstein,
James Whale immediately cast Mae

201
00:13:20,327 --> 00:13:23,205
in the leading role
in The lmpatient Maiden.

202
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:40,043
Here is the miniature exterior
of the old watchtower set

203
00:13:40,127 --> 00:13:42,800
and the full-scale portion of the exterior.

204
00:13:42,887 --> 00:13:46,084
The interiors were built
on a Universal sound stage.

205
00:13:47,407 --> 00:13:52,720
Back in 1927, English theatrical
producer and actor Hamilton Deane

206
00:13:52,807 --> 00:13:55,640
decided to try out
another subject for his company,

207
00:13:55,727 --> 00:13:59,606
to alternate with his version
of Bram Stoker's novel Dracula,

208
00:13:59,687 --> 00:14:02,042
on his tour of the English provinces.

209
00:14:02,127 --> 00:14:06,917
This was to be a new adaptation
of Frankenstein by Peggy Webling.

210
00:14:07,007 --> 00:14:11,523
The initial presentation of this
Frankenstein took place late in 1927

211
00:14:11,607 --> 00:14:13,643
in Preston, England.

212
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,844
It continued to alternate
in the provinces with Dracula,

213
00:14:16,927 --> 00:14:22,240
and it finally opened in London,
considerably revised, in February 1930.

214
00:14:23,127 --> 00:14:28,326
Peggy Webling retained some basic ideas
from the novel and the previous plays,

215
00:14:28,407 --> 00:14:33,959
but she made substantial changes
in time, locale, incidents and characters.

216
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:38,837
Mary Shelley's narrative took place
over a considerable period of time.

217
00:14:38,927 --> 00:14:42,806
In the novel, Frankenstein vows
to destroy his creation

218
00:14:42,887 --> 00:14:45,003
and pursues him to the Arctic,

219
00:14:45,087 --> 00:14:48,875
where the scientist dies
and his foe goes off into the ice and mist,

220
00:14:48,967 --> 00:14:51,925
presumably to his death.

221
00:14:52,007 --> 00:14:54,282
Shortly after the play opened in London,

222
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:58,246
the London Times announced
that it would be produced on Broadway.

223
00:14:58,327 --> 00:15:00,124
As with Deane's Dracula,

224
00:15:00,207 --> 00:15:03,836
playwright and newspaper correspondent
John L Balderston -

225
00:15:03,927 --> 00:15:07,158
who had recently written
the hit play Berkeley Square -

226
00:15:07,247 --> 00:15:11,684
was engaged to revise and brush up
the material for American consumption.

227
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:15,999
He kept, for the most part, Peggy
Webling's modifications and structure,

228
00:15:16,087 --> 00:15:18,647
but he added several touches of his own.

229
00:15:18,727 --> 00:15:24,120
For example, Fritz, the hunchback who
assists Frankenstein in his experiments,

230
00:15:24,207 --> 00:15:27,597
was added - although he is mute
in Balderston's version.

231
00:15:31,287 --> 00:15:37,635
With the release of Dracula in early 1931,
Universal Pictures had a major success.

232
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:42,039
Even before it was in theatres, there had
been discussions regarding a follow-up.

233
00:15:42,127 --> 00:15:44,960
Frankenstein was a logical choice.

234
00:15:45,047 --> 00:15:52,237
The film Dracula was based more on the
Hamilton Deane play than on the novel.

235
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:57,720
This stage version had been exceptionally
well received in England and in America.

236
00:15:57,807 --> 00:16:02,756
Since Universal bought the play version
of Dracula from Deane and Balderston,

237
00:16:02,847 --> 00:16:05,645
they decided to do the same
with Frankenstein.

238
00:16:05,727 --> 00:16:08,799
The original novel, of course,
was in the public domain.

239
00:16:08,887 --> 00:16:14,439
In May 1931, the screen rights for the play
were purchased for $20,000,

240
00:16:19,367 --> 00:16:23,918
At Universal's stipulation, the play wasn't
produced in America - never has been -

241
00:16:24,007 --> 00:16:26,077
contrary to the original plan.

242
00:16:33,767 --> 00:16:35,439
Notice the lateral move here.

243
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:40,920
James Whale liked moving from one area
to another, as on a stage, with a cutaway.

244
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:50,358
Rex Ingram's 1926 film The Magician

245
00:16:50,447 --> 00:16:53,996
has various aspects that were
later used in Frankenstein.

246
00:16:54,087 --> 00:16:56,317
The dwarf assistant in The Magician

247
00:16:56,407 --> 00:17:00,605
hobbled down a staircase
similar to the one in this film

248
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,042
when he was going
to open the tower door.

249
00:17:03,127 --> 00:17:07,598
Also, there is a comic porter scene
from Shakespeare's Macbeth,

250
00:17:07,687 --> 00:17:10,326
and that's often been cited
as an influence.

251
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:18,084
In a letter, Florey said that he and Schayer
"worked with Garrett Fort" -

252
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:19,885
who wrote Universal's Dracula -

253
00:17:19,967 --> 00:17:24,085
"on the first screenplay, following
the lines of my synopsis treatment."

254
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:25,759
"Fort wrote the dialogue."

255
00:17:25,847 --> 00:17:30,637
"My contribution was as continuity
of action and development."

256
00:17:30,727 --> 00:17:35,482
Florey directed a test, shot on
the castle set left over from Dracula,

257
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:39,116
with Bela - Dracula - Lugosi
in the role of the monster.

258
00:17:39,207 --> 00:17:42,916
As early as April, Lugosi had been
announced for Frankenstein.

259
00:17:44,367 --> 00:17:46,119
Florey claims he had thought of him
for the role of Frankenstein,

260
00:17:46,207 --> 00:17:50,120
but that Universal executives
insisted he play the monster.

261
00:17:50,207 --> 00:17:55,998
According to Florey, the edited test ran for
20 minutes, which seems extremely long.

262
00:17:56,087 --> 00:17:58,317
It was photographed by Paul lvano,

263
00:17:58,407 --> 00:18:02,525
and it started with a short conversation
between Victor Moritz and Waldman,

264
00:18:02,607 --> 00:18:05,917
leading to both going
into the Frankenstein laboratory.

265
00:18:06,007 --> 00:18:09,556
Following a scene with
Frankenstein and Fritz in the lab,

266
00:18:09,647 --> 00:18:12,207
there was the arrival
of Waldman and Victor.

267
00:18:12,287 --> 00:18:13,766
According to Florey,

268
00:18:13,847 --> 00:18:18,125
the test lasted up to and including
the initial awakening of the monster.

269
00:18:18,207 --> 00:18:21,597
The actors involved were
Edward Van Sloan, Dwight Frye, Lugosi -

270
00:18:21,687 --> 00:18:26,522
all of whom from the film Dracula -
and two stock players.

271
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:30,077
From all indications,
Lugosi's test make-up and garb

272
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:33,045
were reminiscent of
Paul Wegener in The Golem,

273
00:18:33,127 --> 00:18:37,006
the 1920 German film about
a legendary figure of clay

274
00:18:37,087 --> 00:18:40,682
brought to life by Rabbi Loew
in the 15th century.

275
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:44,646
According to Forrest J Ackerman's
interview with Edward Van Sloan -

276
00:18:44,727 --> 00:18:48,481
who later played the major role of
Doctor Waldman in Frankenstein -

277
00:18:48,567 --> 00:18:53,561
Lugosi arrived for the test
with a head "about four times normal size,

278
00:18:53,647 --> 00:18:55,285
with a broad wig on it."

279
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:58,837
"He had a polished clay-like skin."

280
00:18:58,927 --> 00:19:04,877
Lugosi claimed he did not want to play
a speechless brute laden with make-up.

281
00:19:04,967 --> 00:19:08,039
Mary Shelley's and Webling
and Balderston's talking monster

282
00:19:08,127 --> 00:19:10,038
had been relieved of speech,

283
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:15,360
but he did speak in Universal's first
sequel, The Bride of Frankenstein,

284
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:19,122
for which Balderston received
co-adaptation credit.

285
00:19:19,207 --> 00:19:23,917
The evolving script at the time presented
the monster as totally unsympathetic,

286
00:19:24,007 --> 00:19:25,838
devoid of any pathos.

287
00:19:25,927 --> 00:19:28,122
Who could blame Lugosi?

288
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:34,045
In an interview Carl Laemmle Jr gave
within six months of his death,

289
00:19:34,127 --> 00:19:37,005
he states that the sight of Lugosi
in the test make-up

290
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:41,603
made the studio head
"laugh like a hyena".

291
00:19:41,687 --> 00:19:44,565
Florey claimed
the test make-up was virtually identical

292
00:19:44,647 --> 00:19:46,683
to the final make-up worn by Karloff,

293
00:19:46,767 --> 00:19:51,522
but obviously Laemmle didn't regard
the Karloff version as funny in any way.

294
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:55,077
Karloff himself recalled that
he had been told the Lugosi make-up

295
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:59,957
was "a horrid, hairy thing.
Not at all like our monster."

296
00:20:00,807 --> 00:20:03,241
Make-up artist Jack Pierce
told an interviewer

297
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:07,115
that Lugosi himself influenced
the test make-up negatively,

298
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:11,917
thinking "his ideas
were better than anyone's."

299
00:20:12,007 --> 00:20:13,759
Though not followed to the letter,

300
00:20:13,847 --> 00:20:17,840
the general structure of the first half
of the Webling/Balderston play

301
00:20:17,927 --> 00:20:21,636
was at least in evidence in
the evolving film script for Frankenstein.

302
00:20:21,727 --> 00:20:23,877
But the last part of the play was not used

303
00:20:23,967 --> 00:20:27,596
until Universal made
Bride of Frankenstein four years later.

304
00:20:27,687 --> 00:20:32,715
The final act of the play was concerned
with Frankenstein's preparations

305
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:35,321
for the making of a mate for the creature.

306
00:20:35,407 --> 00:20:37,762
This originated in the novel.

307
00:20:37,847 --> 00:20:40,361
But the monster kills Frankenstein
in the play

308
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:44,725
after his creator decides at the last
moment not to provide him with a mate.

309
00:20:44,807 --> 00:20:47,844
Then the monster stumbles into
the electrical apparatus

310
00:20:47,927 --> 00:20:53,684
and dies as a result of a flash of lightning
and the machine that brought him to life.

311
00:20:53,767 --> 00:20:57,965
Between the time the play premiered
in Preston, England, in 1927

312
00:20:58,047 --> 00:21:00,515
and its London opening in 1930,

313
00:21:00,607 --> 00:21:03,121
there were considerable changes
in the script.

314
00:21:03,207 --> 00:21:07,758
In the early version, the monster
leaps from a cliff and destroys himself.

315
00:21:07,847 --> 00:21:12,363
Frankenstein and his fiancée, whom
the monster had wanted to possess,

316
00:21:12,447 --> 00:21:14,881
are then happily reunited.

317
00:21:14,967 --> 00:21:19,324
There is no material regarding the plan
to create a mate for the monster.

318
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:31,516
By the end of June, a director
was confirmed for Frankenstein:

319
00:21:31,607 --> 00:21:33,438
Britisher James Whale.

320
00:21:33,927 --> 00:21:36,395
Whale was relatively new to Universal.

321
00:21:36,487 --> 00:21:40,275
He'd just finished directing an extremely
well-received screen adaptation

322
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:44,155
of Robert Sherwood's play
Waterloo Bridge for that studio.

323
00:21:44,247 --> 00:21:46,283
His previous film-directing credits

324
00:21:46,367 --> 00:21:50,838
were the dialogue scenes in Howard
Hughes' aviation epic, Hell's Angels,

325
00:21:50,927 --> 00:21:52,645
and all of Journey's End -

326
00:21:52,727 --> 00:21:57,039
the screen version of the exceptionally
popular RC Sherriff World War I play

327
00:21:57,127 --> 00:22:01,086
that Whale had directed on the stage
in London and then in New York.

328
00:22:02,327 --> 00:22:04,238
All of the elaborate electrical apparatus,

329
00:22:04,847 --> 00:22:08,965
full of sound and fury,
but signifying and actually doing nothing,

330
00:22:09,047 --> 00:22:11,242
was built by Kenneth Strickfaden,

331
00:22:11,327 --> 00:22:15,445
who began his film career
as an electrician in 1921.

332
00:22:15,527 --> 00:22:18,837
The first film to use some of
his electrical pyrotechnics

333
00:22:18,927 --> 00:22:22,442
was the 1929 Return of Sherlock Holmes.

334
00:22:22,847 --> 00:22:27,159
The devices that, as a hobby, he had
collected over the years and stored,

335
00:22:27,247 --> 00:22:31,718
came from discarded industrial parts,
old aeroplanes, sections of automobiles,

336
00:22:31,807 --> 00:22:36,164
radio-broadcast transmitters and
odds and ends of electrical equipment.

337
00:22:36,247 --> 00:22:42,117
In 1981, he said "I'd put something
together, then sit back and marvel at it."

338
00:22:42,207 --> 00:22:44,357
"Then I found there was a market."

339
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:49,202
"The styling all depended upon
what kind of junk I had at hand."

340
00:22:49,287 --> 00:22:53,917
The apparatus was leased by the studio
and Ray Lindsay operated it.

341
00:22:54,007 --> 00:22:59,479
In 1981, the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences sponsored a gala affair

342
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:01,842
in Strickfaden's honour.

343
00:23:01,927 --> 00:23:04,157
Above the ceiling-opening of the lab set

344
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:08,081
electricians operated
large lightning-arc machines,

345
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:13,116
which gave off bright flashes of
intermittent light and showers of sparks.

346
00:23:13,207 --> 00:23:18,998
Boris Karloff recalled years later "The
scene made me as uneasy as anyone,

347
00:23:19,087 --> 00:23:23,444
for while I lay half-naked and strapped
to Doctor Frankenstein's table,

348
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:26,121
I could see directly above me
the special-effects men

349
00:23:26,207 --> 00:23:30,564
brandishing the white-hot, scissors-like
carbons that made the lightning."

350
00:23:30,647 --> 00:23:34,481
"I hoped that no one up there
had butterfingers."

351
00:23:36,167 --> 00:23:41,639
Director James Whale later commented
on the importance of the creation scene:

352
00:23:41,727 --> 00:23:45,037
"I consider the creation of the monster
to be the high spot of the film,

353
00:23:45,127 --> 00:23:49,200
because if the audience did not believe
the thing had been really made,

354
00:23:49,287 --> 00:23:52,597
they would not be bothered with
what it was supposed to do afterward."

355
00:23:52,687 --> 00:23:57,203
"By this time, the audience must at least
believe something is going to happen."

356
00:23:57,287 --> 00:24:01,678
"It might be disaster, but at least
they will settle down to see the show."

357
00:24:13,967 --> 00:24:18,518
The lines "In the name of God" and
"Now I know what it feels like to be God"

358
00:24:18,607 --> 00:24:22,077
were deleted by some local and regional
censor groups at the time.

359
00:24:22,167 --> 00:24:23,805
And in 1937,

360
00:24:23,887 --> 00:24:27,562
the Production Code Office required
that the lines, among other aspects,

361
00:24:27,647 --> 00:24:30,525
definitely be eliminated
for reissue approval.

362
00:24:31,927 --> 00:24:36,125
Throughout this film, scenes of
incredible intensity and dramatic impact

363
00:24:36,207 --> 00:24:39,119
are relieved by relatively mild scenes.

364
00:24:39,207 --> 00:24:43,041
Here we are introduced to
Henry's father, Baron Frankenstein,

365
00:24:43,127 --> 00:24:45,641
portrayed by
British stage actor Frederick Kerr,

366
00:24:45,727 --> 00:24:49,561
who had recently worked with
director Whale on Waterloo Bridge.

367
00:24:49,647 --> 00:24:56,678
Incidentally, the baron here refers to
"an old ruined windmill" where his son is.

368
00:24:56,767 --> 00:25:02,524
In early drafts of the script, Frankenstein's
laboratory was in an old ruined windmill.

369
00:25:02,607 --> 00:25:04,598
This was changed to a watchtower,

370
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:08,123
but somehow this reference
in the script wasn't changed.

371
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:11,916
Frederick Kerr was on the stage
almost continuously for 50 years

372
00:25:12,007 --> 00:25:14,362
in both England and America.

373
00:25:14,447 --> 00:25:16,677
In 1930, he commenced his film career

374
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:20,157
and appeared in Raffles with
Ronald Colman, among other films.

375
00:25:20,247 --> 00:25:23,444
Whale requested Kerr for both
Waterloo Bridge and Frankenstein

376
00:25:23,527 --> 00:25:27,315
and said that
"He is an asset to any picture."

377
00:25:27,407 --> 00:25:31,685
Kerr died in 1933 at the age of 74.

378
00:25:31,767 --> 00:25:35,123
Enter the burgomaster,
played by Lionel Belmore.

379
00:25:35,207 --> 00:25:40,520
The British actor arrived in America
in 1907 after being on the London stage.

380
00:25:40,607 --> 00:25:44,600
For a long time he was with
the old Vitagraph Studio in New York City.

381
00:25:44,687 --> 00:25:48,043
Belmore appeared in a great range
of parts over the years,

382
00:25:48,127 --> 00:25:53,440
in such films as the 1922
Oliver Twist, the 1924 Sea Hawk,

383
00:25:53,527 --> 00:25:57,998
The King of Kings, The Count of Monte
Cristo, Cleopatra, Mutiny on the Bounty,

384
00:25:58,087 --> 00:26:02,763
Little Lord Fauntleroy and
The Adventures of Robin Hood in 1938.

385
00:26:02,847 --> 00:26:07,398
His so-called horror pictures are
The Vampire Bat, Son of Frankenstein,

386
00:26:07,487 --> 00:26:11,719
Tower of London
and The Ghost of Frankenstein.

387
00:26:11,807 --> 00:26:16,722
Apparently, producer Carl Laemmle Jr
wanted Whale to do Frankenstein.

388
00:26:16,807 --> 00:26:19,241
He was now the fair-haired boy
around the lot.

389
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:21,602
But Whale wasn't sure.

390
00:26:21,767 --> 00:26:25,077
Dracula and Frankenstein
were both pushed through to production

391
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:27,317
by junior Laemmle's efforts.

392
00:26:27,407 --> 00:26:30,638
He was enthusiastic
about this tale of the macabre,

393
00:26:30,727 --> 00:26:36,404
but his father, Carl Senior, founder and
president of Universal, was apprehensive.

394
00:26:36,487 --> 00:26:40,241
Frankenstein was even
stronger stuff than Dracula.

395
00:26:40,327 --> 00:26:43,956
But young Laemmle, who had been
made head of production in 1929

396
00:26:44,047 --> 00:26:46,880
as a 21st-birthday present from his father,

397
00:26:46,967 --> 00:26:51,358
had been right about the very successful
All Quiet on the Western Front in 1930,

398
00:26:51,447 --> 00:26:54,803
and, of course, he was right
about the recent Dracula.

399
00:26:54,887 --> 00:26:59,039
Whale, after giving the subject some
thought, decided to do Frankenstein -

400
00:26:59,127 --> 00:27:04,042
partly, perhaps, because it wasn't
yet another World War I subject.

401
00:27:04,767 --> 00:27:07,486
Here is another relatively
calm and quiet scene.

402
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:13,005
But we are gradually building up
to the revealment of the creature,

403
00:27:13,087 --> 00:27:14,918
better known as "the monster",

404
00:27:15,007 --> 00:27:18,477
although so far he has done
nothing to deserve that title.

405
00:27:18,567 --> 00:27:22,355
Remember, in 1931 no one had seen
what the character had looked like,

406
00:27:22,447 --> 00:27:25,007
other than advertisements, posters.

407
00:27:25,087 --> 00:27:29,558
His visage was hardly that of the icon
we have known through the decades.

408
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:34,926
Also, we weren't sure what he would do,
how he would react, what would happen.

409
00:27:35,007 --> 00:27:39,285
This speech of Henry Frankenstein,
not in the final shooting script,

410
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:43,599
gives us an added dimension
to Henry's character and psyche.

411
00:27:43,687 --> 00:27:46,042
Colin Clive plays it extremely well.

412
00:27:46,127 --> 00:27:51,406
It is a telling counterpoint to his utterly
believable theatrics in the creation scene.

413
00:27:51,487 --> 00:27:55,275
Here is the intelligent,
enquiring and sensitive human side

414
00:27:55,367 --> 00:27:58,518
of the obsessed and passionate
man of science.

415
00:27:58,607 --> 00:28:02,885
Although Universal wanted Leslie Howard
for the role of Henry Frankenstein,

416
00:28:02,967 --> 00:28:05,162
Whale insisted on Colin Clive,

417
00:28:05,247 --> 00:28:09,638
the British leading player of the stage
and screen versions of Journey's End,

418
00:28:09,727 --> 00:28:11,718
both directed by Whale.

419
00:28:11,807 --> 00:28:16,403
Universal went along with Whale,
and Clive sailed from England.

420
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:20,605
Even assuming that Fritz replaced the jar
marked "abnormal brain"

421
00:28:20,687 --> 00:28:22,678
before handing it to Frankenstein,

422
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:26,806
it would seem, with all his training, the
doctor would have spotted the differences

423
00:28:26,887 --> 00:28:29,560
between a criminal brain
and a normal brain,

424
00:28:29,647 --> 00:28:32,764
as outlined and demonstrated
by Doctor Waldman.

425
00:28:32,847 --> 00:28:35,236
Well, let's call it dramatic licence.

426
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:41,001
The monster's criminal brain became
a thread in many Universal follow-ups.

427
00:28:42,727 --> 00:28:46,766
The first son of Frankenstein wanted to
provide the monster with a healthy brain.

428
00:28:46,847 --> 00:28:51,602
The second son did replace the brain,
but with one not exactly normal -

429
00:28:51,687 --> 00:28:54,406
that of lgor, played by Bela Lugosi.

430
00:28:54,927 --> 00:28:58,078
Then, in 1948, Count Dracula - Lugosi -

431
00:28:58,167 --> 00:29:01,796
would try to give the monster
the brain of Lou Costello

432
00:29:01,887 --> 00:29:04,685
in Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein.

433
00:29:04,767 --> 00:29:07,201
And so it goes, or so it went.

434
00:29:23,767 --> 00:29:27,680
And now, after much anticipation, surely
one of the great theatrical entrances.

435
00:29:29,127 --> 00:29:32,915
Whale chose to direct this
in an unusual, but very effective manner.

436
00:29:33,007 --> 00:29:36,522
First, we heard the sound of
the monster in the hall: Suspense.

437
00:29:36,607 --> 00:29:40,600
Then, when the door opens,
he walks in backwards: More suspense.

438
00:29:40,687 --> 00:29:45,807
And the dramatic turn, followed by
a series of progressively closer shots,

439
00:29:45,887 --> 00:29:51,644
which allow us to be startled,
and yet able to observe in detail that face.

440
00:29:52,807 --> 00:29:56,720
Whale certainly was involved in
the concept of the monster's look.

441
00:29:56,807 --> 00:30:01,039
He made several sketches and consulted
with make-up artist Jack Pierce,

442
00:30:01,127 --> 00:30:04,199
but Pierce was the man
who executed the work.

443
00:30:04,287 --> 00:30:08,724
He and Karloff worked for several hours
each evening over a three-week period

444
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:12,482
to evolve the make-up
prior to the start of production.

445
00:30:12,567 --> 00:30:17,880
Over a bald cap, the head was built up
with layers of cotton and collodion.

446
00:30:17,967 --> 00:30:22,722
The scars were painted on, and
careful shadow-definitions were applied.

447
00:30:22,807 --> 00:30:25,640
Pierce would then hand-lay the hair.

448
00:30:25,727 --> 00:30:29,242
Karloff had a bridge of molars
on his right side that were removed

449
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,204
and he sucked in his cheek.

450
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:33,847
Pierce shaded this for accent.

451
00:30:33,927 --> 00:30:39,763
Karloff's lean, gaunt face and features
were necessary for the perfect realisation.

452
00:30:39,847 --> 00:30:42,156
A top layer of blue-green greasepaint

453
00:30:42,247 --> 00:30:46,320
gave the skin a grey look
on black-and-white film.

454
00:30:46,407 --> 00:30:50,480
Karloff, according to some accounts,
suggested his eyelids be heavily caked,

455
00:30:50,567 --> 00:30:53,877
giving the creature a look
of only partial awareness.

456
00:30:53,967 --> 00:30:57,118
Pierce accomplished this
with mortician's wax.

457
00:30:57,207 --> 00:31:00,677
The metal studs that protruded
from the sides of the monster's neck

458
00:31:00,767 --> 00:31:03,486
were inlets for electricity.

459
00:31:03,567 --> 00:31:09,597
Significantly, the creative make-up always
allowed Karloff's expressions full play,

460
00:31:09,687 --> 00:31:15,398
accounting to a considerable degree for
the effectiveness of his characterisation.

461
00:31:15,487 --> 00:31:18,479
His legs were stiffened by steel struts.

462
00:31:18,567 --> 00:31:22,799
To add to the bulk, he wore a built-up
and padded double-quilted suit

463
00:31:22,887 --> 00:31:25,082
and raised heavy boots.

464
00:31:25,167 --> 00:31:31,163
These were weighted in such a way as to
enable him to lean considerably forward.

465
00:31:31,247 --> 00:31:34,364
The ill-fitting black suit
was made up with shortened sleeves

466
00:31:34,447 --> 00:31:36,915
to make his arms appear longer.

467
00:31:37,007 --> 00:31:38,725
Years later,

468
00:31:38,807 --> 00:31:43,722
Pierce stated that the monster's
final visage was "a compromise"

469
00:31:43,807 --> 00:31:46,526
between his own ideas
and those of Whale.

470
00:31:46,607 --> 00:31:50,885
The overall look of the monster
in all of the subsequent Universal sequels

471
00:31:50,967 --> 00:31:54,676
was never as effective as it was
in the original production -

472
00:31:54,767 --> 00:31:56,644
at least, in my opinion.

473
00:31:56,727 --> 00:32:00,083
Karloff's test convinced
Whale and Universal executives

474
00:32:00,167 --> 00:32:02,476
that he was perfect for the part.

475
00:32:19,487 --> 00:32:22,957
In the August 12th script
this scene is handled quite differently.

476
00:32:23,047 --> 00:32:25,561
I quote from that script:

477
00:32:25,647 --> 00:32:29,526
"The dwarf drops on the floor on all fours,
fumbles in his pocket,

478
00:32:29,607 --> 00:32:34,840
takes out a dirty package of cigarettes,
strikes a match and lights a cigarette."

479
00:32:34,927 --> 00:32:38,715
"The moment the monster sees the fire,
it lets out an unearthly shriek."

480
00:32:38,807 --> 00:32:42,925
"Lts mouth widens to a hideous grin,
its awful hands beat the air,

481
00:32:43,007 --> 00:32:46,716
it starts to rise from the chair,
moves toward the dwarf."

482
00:32:46,807 --> 00:32:51,005
"Frankenstein and Waldman shout.
The monster takes no notice, however."

483
00:32:52,407 --> 00:32:54,443
"So Frankenstein, now frightened,
seizes a box of matches

484
00:32:54,527 --> 00:32:59,840
and strikes match after match
in the monster's face until it is cowed."

485
00:32:59,927 --> 00:33:02,282
"He grovels on the floor, shrieking."

486
00:33:02,367 --> 00:33:05,200
"Frankenstein again
approaches the monster."

487
00:33:05,287 --> 00:33:10,156
"This time he holds a single lighted match
in front of the latter's eyes a long while."

488
00:33:10,247 --> 00:33:12,556
"The monster shrinks from the fire."

489
00:33:12,647 --> 00:33:15,241
"During this, the dwarf
has maliciously crept up."

490
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:17,841
"Stealthily, he kicks the monster."

491
00:33:17,927 --> 00:33:23,081
"Just at this moment, Frankenstein's
last match flares up, then dies out."

492
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:27,683
Obviously, changing the matches to
a torch made much more dramatic sense

493
00:33:27,767 --> 00:33:30,406
and was a precursor for things to come.

494
00:33:30,487 --> 00:33:33,445
Fritz is played by
Kansas-born Dwight Frye -

495
00:33:33,527 --> 00:33:37,566
neither a dwarf nor a hunchback,
but another victim of typecasting

496
00:33:37,647 --> 00:33:42,926
after his role in the 1931 Dracula
as the crazed Renfield.

497
00:33:43,007 --> 00:33:48,764
After Frankenstein, he was the village
lunatic in The Vampire Bat, and so on.

498
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:54,123
But, before coming to Hollywood in 1930,
he had an impressive career on the stage.

499
00:33:54,207 --> 00:33:57,279
After touring in stock,
vaudeville and musical comedy,

500
00:33:57,367 --> 00:34:00,564
he then had leading roles
in a variety of Broadway plays,

501
00:34:00,647 --> 00:34:07,280
and in 1929 the critics voted him one of
the ten best actors of the legitimate stage.

502
00:34:07,367 --> 00:34:12,361
He died in 1943, aged 44,
from a heart attack,

503
00:34:12,447 --> 00:34:15,803
which could have been brought on
by the strain of working nights

504
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:21,405
at Lockheed Aircraft Company in World
War II in order to support his family,

505
00:34:21,487 --> 00:34:26,561
while playing some bit roles by day
and acting in local theatrical productions.

506
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:31,163
His death certificate listed his occupation
as "tool designer".

507
00:34:32,887 --> 00:34:36,163
In the play,
especially in Balderston's version,

508
00:34:36,247 --> 00:34:40,798
Frankenstein's relationship to the monster
is decreed, in Frankenstein's words,

509
00:34:40,887 --> 00:34:45,005
as "Only command, blind obedience,
no discussion."

510
00:34:45,087 --> 00:34:46,998
He treats the creature cruelly,

511
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:52,320
and in Balderston's adaptations makes
considerable use of a whip and a hot iron.

512
00:34:52,407 --> 00:34:56,685
He also finds satisfaction in having
the monster perform tricks like a puppy,

513
00:34:56,767 --> 00:35:02,763
literally commanding him to "lie down,
roll over", and he refers to him as a slave.

514
00:35:02,847 --> 00:35:08,399
Frankenstein announces that the creature
"must be afraid of me. He must obey me."

515
00:35:08,487 --> 00:35:13,163
This cruelty is transferred in the final
screen version to the character of Fritz,

516
00:35:13,247 --> 00:35:17,286
who continually provokes Frankenstein's
creation with whip and torch,

517
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:20,837
thereby making Frankenstein
more sympathetic.

518
00:35:20,927 --> 00:35:25,205
Incidentally, many people refer to
the monster by the name of Frankenstein.

519
00:35:25,287 --> 00:35:28,677
In fact, in Peggy Webling's 1927 play,

520
00:35:28,767 --> 00:35:33,204
the revised 1930 presentation,
and Balderston's version of the play,

521
00:35:33,287 --> 00:35:37,121
the monster is called Frankenstein
after its creator,

522
00:35:37,207 --> 00:35:39,846
on many occasions
by some of the characters.

523
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:47,325
Whale was quoted, when asked why
he decided to do Frankenstein:

524
00:35:47,407 --> 00:35:50,922
"Of 30 available stories,
it was the strongest meat,

525
00:35:51,007 --> 00:35:54,044
and gave me a chance
to dabble in the macabre."

526
00:35:54,127 --> 00:35:58,564
"I thought it would be amusing to try
and make a physical impossibility

527
00:35:58,647 --> 00:36:00,399
seem believable."

528
00:36:00,487 --> 00:36:05,720
"Also it offered fine pictorial chances,
had two grand characterisations,

529
00:36:05,807 --> 00:36:09,004
and had a subject matter
that might go anywhere -

530
00:36:09,087 --> 00:36:12,523
and that's part of the fun
of making pictures."

531
00:36:12,607 --> 00:36:17,078
Among the changes made in the script by
the new writer, Francis Edwards Faragoh,

532
00:36:17,167 --> 00:36:20,318
was giving dialogue to Fritz,
Frankenstein's assistant,

533
00:36:20,407 --> 00:36:23,638
who in the previous Universal scripts
had been a mute.

534
00:36:23,727 --> 00:36:27,720
Also, Frankenstein's laboratory
was now located in an old watchtower,

535
00:36:27,807 --> 00:36:30,116
rather than the deserted mill.

536
00:36:30,207 --> 00:36:33,040
The mill, however, was retained
for the final scene.

537
00:36:33,127 --> 00:36:37,882
Most importantly, both Frankenstein
and the monster were modified

538
00:36:37,967 --> 00:36:42,916
into basically more sympathetic
characters, given more dimension.

539
00:36:43,007 --> 00:36:45,396
Certainly now
we feel sorry for the monster,

540
00:36:45,487 --> 00:36:48,126
as in the novel and the Webling play.

541
00:36:50,567 --> 00:36:54,082
In the novel
Frankenstein is a student of science,

542
00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:56,761
not a doctor, not the son of a baron.

543
00:36:58,407 --> 00:37:00,682
The scene in which
the monster is given life

544
00:37:00,767 --> 00:37:04,237
takes place in the upstairs room
of Frankenstein's house,

545
00:37:04,327 --> 00:37:07,637
not, as in this film, an old watchtower.

546
00:37:07,727 --> 00:37:13,279
There is no apparatus giving forth
a pyrotechnic display during the creation,

547
00:37:13,367 --> 00:37:16,325
no raging electrical storm outside.

548
00:37:16,407 --> 00:37:18,443
In the Webling/Balderston play,

549
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:22,759
Frankenstein's study, in an old house
at Goldstadt in Switzerland,

550
00:37:22,847 --> 00:37:27,762
has been fashioned into a laboratory, and
there's a storm during the creation scene.

551
00:37:27,847 --> 00:37:31,920
In the early versions of the screenplay
an abandoned windmill is used for the lab

552
00:37:32,007 --> 00:37:33,725
and a storm is raging.

553
00:37:33,807 --> 00:37:38,358
A description of the setting in a
preliminary script draft in the studio files

554
00:37:38,447 --> 00:37:43,760
mentions "something suggestive
of the laboratory in Metropolis."

555
00:37:43,847 --> 00:37:45,917
The 1926 German silent film

556
00:37:46,007 --> 00:37:50,478
had a mad scientist
involved in a laboratory creation scene

557
00:37:50,567 --> 00:37:54,162
amidst considerable
electrical paraphernalia.

558
00:37:54,247 --> 00:37:57,125
In Mary Shelley's book,
the description of the procedures

559
00:37:57,207 --> 00:38:00,802
by which Frankenstein gave
his creation life is vague.

560
00:38:00,887 --> 00:38:06,120
Indeed, this major sequence
of the creation, a high point in this film,

561
00:38:06,207 --> 00:38:11,679
is presented in one
not-very-detailed paragraph in the book:

562
00:38:11,767 --> 00:38:16,477
"It was on a dreary night of November that
I beheld the accomplishment of my toils."

563
00:38:16,567 --> 00:38:19,877
"With an anxiety
that almost amounted to agony,

564
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:22,959
I collected the instruments of life
around me,

565
00:38:23,047 --> 00:38:28,758
that I might infuse a spark of being
into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet."

566
00:38:28,847 --> 00:38:30,917
"It was already one in the morning;

567
00:38:31,007 --> 00:38:34,477
the rain pattered dismally
outside the panes,

568
00:38:34,567 --> 00:38:37,479
and my candle was
nearly burnt out, when,

569
00:38:37,567 --> 00:38:40,445
by the glimmer of
the half-extinguished light,

570
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:44,520
I saw the dull, yellow eye
of the creature open."

571
00:38:44,607 --> 00:38:49,840
"It breathed hard and
a convulsive motion agitated its limbs."

572
00:38:50,647 --> 00:38:53,878
Then in another paragraph she wrote:

573
00:38:53,967 --> 00:38:56,117
"I had worked hard for nearly two years

574
00:38:56,207 --> 00:39:00,246
for the sole purpose of infusing life
into an inanimate body."

575
00:39:00,327 --> 00:39:03,603
"For this I had deprived myself
of rest and health."

576
00:39:03,687 --> 00:39:07,077
"I had desired it with an ardour
that far exceeded moderation,

577
00:39:07,167 --> 00:39:11,126
but now, now that I had finished,
the beauty of the dream vanished,

578
00:39:11,207 --> 00:39:15,485
and breathless horror and disgust
filled my heart."

579
00:39:16,527 --> 00:39:18,882
The monster has been described
as a projection

580
00:39:18,967 --> 00:39:23,085
of Mary Shelley's feeling
of isolation and hatred,

581
00:39:23,167 --> 00:39:27,126
which stem from the death of her mother
when she was only ten days old.

582
00:39:27,207 --> 00:39:31,997
Mary was barely tolerated
by her cruel father and was driven inward,

583
00:39:32,087 --> 00:39:36,877
spending her childhood in solitary
pastimes: Reading, writing, daydreaming.

584
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:41,398
In a letter sent to Colin Clive
before production,

585
00:39:41,487 --> 00:39:47,119
director James Whale described how he
perceived the character of Frankenstein:

586
00:39:47,207 --> 00:39:49,277
"An intensely sane person,

587
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:53,997
at times rather fanatical, and
in one or two scenes, a little hysterical."

588
00:39:54,087 --> 00:39:57,557
"And a little reminiscent of
the breakdown in Journey's End."

589
00:39:57,647 --> 00:40:00,207
"Frankenstein's nerves are all to pieces."

590
00:40:00,287 --> 00:40:06,237
"All the time I should feel Frankenstein
is normally an extremely intelligent,

591
00:40:06,327 --> 00:40:09,922
a sane and lovable person, never
unsympathetic, even to the monster."

592
00:40:12,687 --> 00:40:14,837
Shortly after talking over Frankenstein,

593
00:40:14,927 --> 00:40:18,840
James Whale did not have an actor
in mind to play the monster.

594
00:40:18,927 --> 00:40:21,680
Whale's companion, David Lewis,
had been impressed

595
00:40:21,767 --> 00:40:26,045
with Boris Karloff's performance
as the rather ungainly and odd convict

596
00:40:26,127 --> 00:40:29,244
in the stage and screen versions
of The Criminal Code.

597
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:33,718
He recommended that Whale meet
the actor to see for himself the potential.

598
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:38,483
Whale and Karloff arranged a meeting and
Whale decided to test him for the role.

599
00:40:38,567 --> 00:40:42,924
Whale said later on
that he was fascinated by Karloff's face:

600
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:45,840
"His physique was weaker
than I could wish,

601
00:40:45,927 --> 00:40:51,559
but that queer, penetrating personality,
I felt, was more important than his shape,

602
00:40:51,647 --> 00:40:54,525
which could easily be altered."

603
00:40:54,607 --> 00:40:58,395
Although Karloff had been
in American films since 1919,

604
00:40:58,487 --> 00:41:00,955
he was hardly a well-known performer.

605
00:41:01,047 --> 00:41:05,325
Most of his parts in silent films
were small or not particularly significant,

606
00:41:05,407 --> 00:41:08,638
but just before Frankenstein
things were looking somewhat better,

607
00:41:08,727 --> 00:41:12,640
with showy parts in
The Criminal Code and Five Star Final.

608
00:41:13,767 --> 00:41:17,043
Karloff's real name
was William Henry Pratt.

609
00:41:17,127 --> 00:41:21,598
Born in a London suburb,
he emigrated to Canada in 1909

610
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:24,884
and eventually joined
various theatrical touring companies,

611
00:41:24,967 --> 00:41:29,324
playing supporting roles in plays
all over Canada and the United States.

612
00:41:29,407 --> 00:41:34,037
By 1919, he was in Hollywood
playing extra and bit parts in films.

613
00:41:34,127 --> 00:41:38,917
He also alternated as a truck driver
until the mid-'20s to support himself.

614
00:41:39,007 --> 00:41:43,398
Frankenstein, of course, made him a star
in a myriad of horror films,

615
00:41:43,487 --> 00:41:46,877
but he also played character parts
in a variety of other films.

616
00:41:46,967 --> 00:41:50,198
But the public identified him with horror.

617
00:42:00,407 --> 00:42:05,435
Once again, as relief and counterpoint to
all of the preceding high-intensity drama,

618
00:42:05,527 --> 00:42:08,678
or melodrama, if you will,
and the mayhem,

619
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,918
we have a tranquil and idyllic interlude.

620
00:42:12,007 --> 00:42:14,043
A romantic scene, yet.

621
00:42:14,127 --> 00:42:17,005
Colin Clive gets an opportunity
to shift gears

622
00:42:17,087 --> 00:42:20,443
now that he is away from
graveyards and old watchtowers.

623
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:26,640
Clive was from a military family,
a descendant of the famous Clive of India.

624
00:42:26,727 --> 00:42:29,764
His father was a distinguished colonel
in the British army.

625
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:32,725
Young Colin's horse fell
in cavalry training,

626
00:42:32,807 --> 00:42:36,436
fracturing the young man's knee
and ending his military future.

627
00:42:36,527 --> 00:42:38,916
The leg never fully healed.

628
00:42:39,007 --> 00:42:42,443
He was forced to resign from
Sandhurst Royal Military College

629
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:46,566
and went into the theatre, training
at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.

630
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48,877
He made his London bow in 1919

631
00:42:48,967 --> 00:42:52,596
and toured in many plays,
including repertory companies.

632
00:42:52,687 --> 00:42:56,600
James Whale hired him to play
the doomed Captain Stanhope

633
00:42:56,687 --> 00:43:01,397
in the extremely successful
World War I drama Journey's End.

634
00:43:01,487 --> 00:43:06,356
He starred in the play and film version,
which was also directed by Whale.

635
00:43:06,447 --> 00:43:08,597
Other film roles following Frankenstein

636
00:43:08,687 --> 00:43:13,124
include One More River, from
the last of The Forsyte Saga novels,

637
00:43:13,207 --> 00:43:15,357
also directed by Whale,

638
00:43:15,447 --> 00:43:20,362
Clive of India, about his ancestor,
Mad Love, based on The Hands of Orlac,

639
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:22,961
The Man Who Broke the Bank
at Monte Carlo,

640
00:43:23,047 --> 00:43:26,960
and, of course,
The Bride of Frankenstein in 1935,

641
00:43:27,047 --> 00:43:30,676
in which he reprised his role
for director Whale.

642
00:43:30,767 --> 00:43:36,239
Mae Clarke said in 1971
"Oh, how I remember that voice."

643
00:43:36,327 --> 00:43:40,605
"Jim Whale would say about Colin
'His voice is like a pipe organ."'

644
00:43:40,687 --> 00:43:46,125
"'You just arrange him, pull out the stops
and his voice comes out like music."'

645
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:50,955
But Clive in his personal life
was tormented and anguished,

646
00:43:51,047 --> 00:43:55,086
fraught with his private demons -
a kind of Jekyll and Hyde.

647
00:43:55,167 --> 00:43:56,964
He also drank heavily.

648
00:43:57,047 --> 00:44:03,919
In 1937, at the age of 37,
Colin Clive died as a result of alcoholism.

649
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:11,760
Prior to the 1931 Frankenstein there were
three silent-film productions of the story,

650
00:44:11,847 --> 00:44:14,680
the first going back to 1910.

651
00:44:14,767 --> 00:44:18,646
The Edison Company's
approximately 15-minute-long version,

652
00:44:18,727 --> 00:44:24,120
according to the script, was a liberal
adaptation of Mrs Shelley's famous story.

653
00:44:24,207 --> 00:44:27,517
It featured a hunchbacked
and shaggy-chested monster

654
00:44:27,607 --> 00:44:29,484
suggestive of Quasimodo,

655
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:34,163
with a stark, kabuki-like white face
and a mass of matted hair.

656
00:44:34,247 --> 00:44:38,957
The monster was formed
in a "cauldron of blazing chemical"

657
00:44:39,047 --> 00:44:41,481
rather than with the aid of electricity.

658
00:44:41,567 --> 00:44:46,118
The climax of the film introduced
some aspects of the Jekyll-Hyde theme -

659
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:49,722
the monster was defeated
by the power of love.

660
00:44:49,807 --> 00:44:53,356
This, presumably the world's
first horror film, was filmed

661
00:44:53,447 --> 00:44:57,725
at the Edison Manufacturing Company
Studio at Bedford Park, the Bronx,

662
00:44:57,807 --> 00:45:00,196
under the direction of J Searle Dawley,

663
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:04,883
and was colour-tinted and/or toned
for daylight and night scenes.

664
00:45:04,967 --> 00:45:09,324
Then there was the feature-length
Life Without Soul in 1915.

665
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:14,765
In this adaptation the monster had
no bizarre trappings or unusual make-up.

666
00:45:14,847 --> 00:45:19,204
He was "awe-inspiring,
but never grotesque".

667
00:45:19,287 --> 00:45:25,442
One character was established by being
shown reading the story from a book.

668
00:45:25,527 --> 00:45:28,360
When Frankenstein died
after killing the monster,

669
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:33,237
the book was closed and each of the
characters revealed to be alive and well.

670
00:45:33,327 --> 00:45:38,879
The third filming was done in Italy in 1920
and called The Monster of Frankenstein.

671
00:45:38,967 --> 00:45:42,198
No known negatives or prints
survive of the silent productions,

672
00:45:42,287 --> 00:45:45,518
with the exception of the 1910 version.

673
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:50,838
With the exception of this sequence,

674
00:45:50,927 --> 00:45:56,445
Frankenstein was filmed on the Universal
lot and the immediate surrounding terrain.

675
00:45:56,527 --> 00:46:01,442
But now the production moved to what
was almost certainly Lake Sherwood

676
00:46:01,527 --> 00:46:04,360
in the Santa Monica Mountains
near Westlake Village

677
00:46:04,447 --> 00:46:09,316
and close to the dividing line between
Los Angeles County and Ventura County.

678
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:12,479
Lake Sherwood and its immediate
neighbour, Sherwood Forest,

679
00:46:12,567 --> 00:46:17,516
had been used for many years as a choice
location for all kinds of outdoor pictures.

680
00:46:17,607 --> 00:46:20,724
The name, according to various sources,
derived from its use

681
00:46:20,807 --> 00:46:24,766
in Douglas Fairbanks's
1922 production of Robin Hood,

682
00:46:24,847 --> 00:46:28,760
and it was ideal for jungle epics,
Westerns, you name it.

683
00:46:28,847 --> 00:46:32,362
Seven-year-old Marilyn Harris
was chosen to befriend the monster

684
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:34,403
in this delicate portrayal.

685
00:46:34,487 --> 00:46:39,277
The monster, for the first and only time,
finds a human who is unafraid of him -

686
00:46:39,367 --> 00:46:41,597
an innocent peasant child.

687
00:46:41,687 --> 00:46:43,803
Karloff later said

688
00:46:43,887 --> 00:46:48,005
"Whale and I both saw the character
of the monster as an innocent one."

689
00:46:48,087 --> 00:46:50,920
"This was a pathetic creature
who, like us all,

690
00:46:51,007 --> 00:46:53,805
had neither wish nor say in his creation,

691
00:46:53,887 --> 00:46:57,197
and certainly did not wish upon itself
the hideous image

692
00:46:57,287 --> 00:47:01,166
which automatically terrified humans
whom it tried to befriend."

693
00:47:01,247 --> 00:47:04,922
"What astonished us was
the fantastic number of ordinary people

694
00:47:05,007 --> 00:47:07,521
that got this general air of sympathy."

695
00:47:07,607 --> 00:47:10,405
"I found all my letters heavy with it."

696
00:47:10,687 --> 00:47:14,965
In the Peggy Webling play the monster
accidentally crushes a dove in his hands

697
00:47:15,047 --> 00:47:18,756
and throws it into the lake,
where, much to his delight, it floats.

698
00:47:18,847 --> 00:47:24,877
Then he takes Frankenstein's crippled
sister, a character not in the novel or film,

699
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:30,644
out in a boat and tries to make her
float like the dove - but she drowns.

700
00:47:30,727 --> 00:47:33,161
His remorse at this act
is one of the motivations

701
00:47:33,247 --> 00:47:38,321
that leads to his flinging himself
off the cliff in the 1927 play version.

702
00:47:38,407 --> 00:47:43,276
The monster, as portrayed by Hamilton
Deane in this play, was sympathetic.

703
00:47:43,367 --> 00:47:45,927
In a variant version from the same play,

704
00:47:46,007 --> 00:47:50,398
at the side of a river the creature, unaware
that death can be caused by drowning,

705
00:47:50,487 --> 00:47:53,047
placed the girl's head beneath the water

706
00:47:53,127 --> 00:47:56,403
to see her lovely face
through the glassy surface.

707
00:47:56,487 --> 00:47:59,797
Marilyn Harris, years later, recalled that

708
00:47:59,887 --> 00:48:03,766
"After the monster threw me into the lake
I was supposed to swim underwater,

709
00:48:03,847 --> 00:48:08,443
but I had only three swimming lessons.
I didn't even know how to go underwater."

710
00:48:08,527 --> 00:48:12,076
"They had rowboats in a semicircle
outside of camera range,

711
00:48:12,167 --> 00:48:15,603
but the first time the monster threw me in
I couldn't go underwater,

712
00:48:15,687 --> 00:48:17,439
I had too many clothes on."

713
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:21,076
"I had to get all my clothes dry
and my hair redone", says Marilyn.

714
00:48:21,167 --> 00:48:24,443
"The second shot went fine.
Boris Karloff threw me in again

715
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:26,722
and I went underwater
out of camera range."

716
00:48:26,807 --> 00:48:29,719
Touched and excited
with his first encounter with beauty,

717
00:48:29,807 --> 00:48:32,446
the monster tries to float the little girl

718
00:48:32,527 --> 00:48:36,156
and feels intense pain and confusion
when she sinks.

719
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:40,035
Later the scene was considerably cut
and modified from what you see now,

720
00:48:40,127 --> 00:48:42,197
but more about that anon.

721
00:48:51,527 --> 00:48:54,678
This European village
was built on the back lot at Universal

722
00:48:54,767 --> 00:48:58,123
for All Quiet on the Western Front in 1930.

723
00:48:58,207 --> 00:49:00,721
It was used through the years
for a great many films,

724
00:49:00,807 --> 00:49:03,765
including subsequent
Frankenstein productions.

725
00:49:03,847 --> 00:49:06,441
The village was destroyed by fire
many years later.

726
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:10,520
The present European street
was then constructed on the same site.

727
00:49:10,607 --> 00:49:15,362
The dances are authentically performed
by Austrian musicians and dancers.

728
00:49:15,447 --> 00:49:20,999
Incidentally, where exactly are we?
In Austria, Germany, Switzerland?

729
00:49:21,087 --> 00:49:23,237
And what is the time period?

730
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:26,399
The wardrobe varies from 1931 fashions

731
00:49:26,487 --> 00:49:30,162
to Doctor Waldman's frock coat
of an earlier vintage.

732
00:49:30,247 --> 00:49:34,638
There is never any indication of
an automobile, a telephone, a radio,

733
00:49:34,727 --> 00:49:39,243
to say nothing of the practice of hanging
bodies on gibbets for public viewing.

734
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:42,160
This was abandoned in Europe
before the 20th century.

735
00:49:42,247 --> 00:49:46,957
And, being somewhere in Europe, they all
speak with a British or American accent.

736
00:49:47,527 --> 00:49:51,361
In another exchange between
Universal executive Henry Henigson

737
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:54,996
and screenwriter Garrett Fort
during the script-development stage,

738
00:49:55,087 --> 00:50:00,002
Henigson wrote "I think everyone in the
production should speak perfect English

739
00:50:00,087 --> 00:50:03,397
and we should take away
the jas, the Herrs, the Frauleins

740
00:50:03,487 --> 00:50:07,878
and twists in the language's construction
which give it a Teutonic distinction."

741
00:50:07,967 --> 00:50:11,755
"We're not trying to place the picture
geographically in any particular spot,

742
00:50:11,847 --> 00:50:15,760
and I think that we can attend to this
by taking the Teutonic element out of it."

743
00:50:15,847 --> 00:50:20,716
Garrett Fort replied
"In a story laid in and around Goldstadt,

744
00:50:20,807 --> 00:50:25,403
with names like Frankenstein,
Waldman, Moritz, Fritz, etc,

745
00:50:25,487 --> 00:50:28,797
it seems that a Teutonic element
is inescapable."

746
00:50:28,887 --> 00:50:33,005
"If we lay it elsewhere it will be necessary
to change every name in the cast,

747
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:38,719
probably even that of Frankenstein, which
certainly has Teutonic connotations."

748
00:50:38,807 --> 00:50:42,959
"This might lead to titles such as
'The Monster', 'Garibaldi',

749
00:50:43,047 --> 00:50:46,437
or 'Love and Murder in Norway', etc."

750
00:50:46,527 --> 00:50:50,679
"I have an idea that there is nothing
offensive about the Teutonic slant."

751
00:50:50,767 --> 00:50:54,726
"And it is a particularly pertinent angle
when we consider that

752
00:50:54,807 --> 00:51:00,120
the Teutonic type of mind is certainly
foremost in the scientific world, etc."

753
00:51:01,727 --> 00:51:04,116
Another scene between
Elizabeth and Henry.

754
00:51:04,207 --> 00:51:08,086
This time Elizabeth's premonition
of danger and death

755
00:51:08,167 --> 00:51:10,601
is about to become a reality.

756
00:51:11,327 --> 00:51:16,845
In the novel, Frankenstein reluctantly
agrees to create a female for the monster,

757
00:51:16,927 --> 00:51:19,805
but he changes his mind and
the outraged monster tells Frankenstein

758
00:51:20,807 --> 00:51:25,722
that "I will be with you
on your wedding night."

759
00:51:25,807 --> 00:51:28,401
After Frankenstein and Elizabeth marry,

760
00:51:28,487 --> 00:51:32,082
the monster keeps his word
and kills the bride.

761
00:51:32,167 --> 00:51:38,356
In Edison's 1910 film version, the monster
returns on Frankenstein's wedding night

762
00:51:38,447 --> 00:51:41,996
and, hearing his bride scream,
Frankenstein interrupts the attack

763
00:51:42,087 --> 00:51:43,805
and the monster flees.

764
00:51:43,887 --> 00:51:47,197
In Peggy Webling's 1927 British play,

765
00:51:47,287 --> 00:51:50,996
the monster falls in love
with Frankenstein's fiancée.

766
00:51:51,087 --> 00:51:54,045
She is captured by him,
but finally escapes.

767
00:51:54,647 --> 00:51:58,879
Lewis Klein, the general manager of
Horace Liveright Theatrical Productions,

768
00:51:58,967 --> 00:52:03,006
the potential producer of the
Webling/Balderston US play version,

769
00:52:03,087 --> 00:52:07,399
added some ingredients of the
bodice-ripping school of sensationalism

770
00:52:07,487 --> 00:52:10,081
to John Balderston's adaptation.

771
00:52:10,167 --> 00:52:14,240
The monster confronts
Frankenstein's bride and seizes her.

772
00:52:14,327 --> 00:52:19,117
In the struggle he tears off her bridal veil
and the top of her wedding gown -

773
00:52:19,207 --> 00:52:24,076
"Which gown", Klein explained,
"is a breakaway affair,

774
00:52:24,167 --> 00:52:27,284
and leaves her as nude
as the censor will allow."

775
00:52:27,367 --> 00:52:30,200
"Then he is about to mount her in a rape."

776
00:52:30,767 --> 00:52:34,601
This production, as we know,
was never presented on the stage.

777
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:37,485
The staging of this scene
resembles a similar scene

778
00:52:37,567 --> 00:52:41,640
in the 1919 film
The Cabinet of Dr Caligari,

779
00:52:41,727 --> 00:52:44,480
whereby the character
portrayed by Conrad Veidt

780
00:52:44,567 --> 00:52:47,843
has been sent to kill a lovely girl
in her bedroom.

781
00:52:47,927 --> 00:52:50,236
The suspense here is well orchestrated

782
00:52:50,327 --> 00:52:54,798
and both players do not go over the top
in the realisation of the scene.

783
00:52:55,967 --> 00:53:00,006
Although Mae Clarke remembers tea
breaks each mid-afternoon during filming,

784
00:53:00,087 --> 00:53:04,160
she never had an opportunity
to get to know Karloff very well.

785
00:53:04,247 --> 00:53:07,956
"He would arrive at 4am
and spend four hours in make-up."

786
00:53:08,047 --> 00:53:12,962
"He didn't have lunch with us because
it was easier for him, due to the make-up,

787
00:53:13,047 --> 00:53:15,322
to eat alone
in his dressing-room bungalow,

788
00:53:15,407 --> 00:53:17,841
where he could remove
some of his body padding."

789
00:53:17,927 --> 00:53:22,000
"Then a couple of hours would be spent
removing his make-up at the day's end,

790
00:53:22,087 --> 00:53:23,884
and he would require a rubdown

791
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:27,676
after stomping around all day
with those weights on his shoes."

792
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:32,565
The woodcutter is carrying his drowned
daughter to the burgomaster's office.

793
00:53:32,647 --> 00:53:35,639
The scripts had Maria
being carried by her mother,

794
00:53:35,727 --> 00:53:38,525
who was also established earlier
at their cottage.

795
00:53:38,607 --> 00:53:42,919
This particularly long tracking shot -
actually two tracking shots -

796
00:53:43,007 --> 00:53:45,999
apparently was difficult for both players.

797
00:53:46,087 --> 00:53:50,922
Marilyn Harris recalled "And did that
ever hurt. It was the longest walk."

798
00:53:51,007 --> 00:53:53,680
"All I can remember is
'Stay limp, don't move,

799
00:53:53,767 --> 00:53:56,725
just let your arms flop,
just let your hands flop."'

800
00:53:56,807 --> 00:53:59,640
"Oh, my back hurt so bad."

801
00:53:59,727 --> 00:54:04,198
Michael Mark, playing the father,
appeared later in Son of Frankenstein,

802
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:07,518
The Ghost of Frankenstein
and The House of Frankenstein,

803
00:54:07,607 --> 00:54:09,802
with different roles in each.

804
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:15,043
Going back to the drowning at the lake,
this scene was cut entirely or in part

805
00:54:15,127 --> 00:54:19,279
by many local state and city censors
and in foreign countries

806
00:54:19,367 --> 00:54:21,881
before the film's initial release.

807
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:25,801
But when the studio applied to
the Production Code Administration

808
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:28,959
for a reissue seal of approval in 1937,

809
00:54:29,047 --> 00:54:31,436
various cuts were demanded.

810
00:54:32,127 --> 00:54:36,564
This scene was modified in a manner that
paradoxically compounded the problem.

811
00:54:36,647 --> 00:54:38,399
The action played as photographed

812
00:54:38,487 --> 00:54:42,446
up to the point where the monster
had thrown his last daisy into the water.

813
00:54:42,527 --> 00:54:47,043
He watched it, then looked at his empty
hands and held them out toward the child.

814
00:54:47,127 --> 00:54:49,118
The rest of the scene was deleted,

815
00:54:49,207 --> 00:54:54,361
and it stayed deleted for decades
until Universal's restoration.

816
00:54:54,447 --> 00:54:58,838
The motivation to destroy the monster
is gaining momentum.

817
00:54:58,927 --> 00:55:03,443
Maria's father, the townspeople,
the burgomaster,

818
00:55:03,527 --> 00:55:06,564
and certainly Frankenstein, were ready.

819
00:55:07,647 --> 00:55:10,684
Incidentally, has anyone
noticed the disappearance

820
00:55:10,767 --> 00:55:13,486
of the old baron, Henry's father?

821
00:55:13,567 --> 00:55:18,482
He wasn't around before, during and after
the monster was loose in the household,

822
00:55:18,567 --> 00:55:20,478
and he's not around now.

823
00:55:21,727 --> 00:55:24,924
The original plan,
as we know from scripts and memos,

824
00:55:25,007 --> 00:55:29,797
was to keep Victor Moritz on the scene,
quietly longing for Elizabeth,

825
00:55:29,887 --> 00:55:35,519
so he and Elizabeth would be with each
other after the forthcoming tragic events.

826
00:55:35,607 --> 00:55:39,282
Hence the emphasis on
"I leave her in your care."

827
00:55:43,367 --> 00:55:46,439
Obviously, it is clearly understood
that neither Victor nor Elizabeth

828
00:55:46,527 --> 00:55:48,722
are joining the hunting party.

829
00:55:50,767 --> 00:55:54,646
There seems to be no question about
the durability of the Frankenstein theme,

830
00:55:54,727 --> 00:55:57,719
with its innumerable interpretations.

831
00:55:57,807 --> 00:56:01,686
The cosmic theme of the limits of man
and the power of God,

832
00:56:01,767 --> 00:56:04,804
which extends to man emulating God.

833
00:56:04,887 --> 00:56:11,156
The disturbing idea that science could
create life, possibly even eternal life.

834
00:56:11,247 --> 00:56:14,205
The fascination with dolls,
mechanical puppets and robots

835
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:16,926
that effectively simulate life.

836
00:56:17,007 --> 00:56:19,646
The Faustian concept of the overreacher,

837
00:56:19,727 --> 00:56:25,916
who momentarily commands divine
power, only to be destroyed because of it.

838
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:28,805
The father creator
who abandons his child.

839
00:56:28,887 --> 00:56:32,084
Frankenstein's crime
was that he abandoned his creature.

840
00:56:32,167 --> 00:56:36,877
The theme of the divided self,
in this instance creator and creature,

841
00:56:36,967 --> 00:56:41,916
that is part of the human psyche
and derives from ancient legend.

842
00:56:42,007 --> 00:56:44,646
The dumb innocent,
craving love and understanding,

843
00:56:44,727 --> 00:56:47,878
but forced to become violent
and exercise hatred

844
00:56:47,967 --> 00:56:52,165
because of the lack of compassion
and the fear of others.

845
00:56:52,247 --> 00:56:57,241
Frustration and overwhelming rejection
were the cause of the monster's brutality.

846
00:56:57,327 --> 00:57:01,878
Frankenstein, then, is a mixture
of fascination and horror,

847
00:57:01,967 --> 00:57:04,003
dream and nightmare.

848
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:07,921
Mary Shelley succeeded in
creating a tale that would, she said,

849
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:13,161
"Speak to the mysterious fears
of our nature and awaken thrilling horror."

850
00:57:15,847 --> 00:57:19,999
The enraged, driven villagers,
frequently carrying torches,

851
00:57:20,087 --> 00:57:24,399
became a staple in Universal's cavalcade
of Frankenstein films.

852
00:57:24,487 --> 00:57:29,322
In Bride of Frankenstein, villagers seek
the monster with lanterns and weapons.

853
00:57:29,407 --> 00:57:33,764
In Son of Frankenstein, the villagers
storm Castle Frankenstein's gate.

854
00:57:33,847 --> 00:57:38,159
In The Ghost of Frankenstein,
villagers storm the castle to dynamite it.

855
00:57:38,247 --> 00:57:40,158
In Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man,

856
00:57:40,247 --> 00:57:44,081
the townspeople are in pursuit
with guns and howling dogs.

857
00:57:44,167 --> 00:57:48,285
In House of Frankenstein,
there is a band of torch-bearing villagers.

858
00:57:48,367 --> 00:57:52,076
In House of Dracula, the mob
chases the murderer through the town,

859
00:57:52,167 --> 00:57:54,920
up the hills and through the cemetery.

860
00:57:55,007 --> 00:57:59,205
The exterior chase scenes were shot
on portions of the Universal back lot,

861
00:57:59,287 --> 00:58:03,678
including Pollard Lake,
and around the nearby hills.

862
00:58:03,767 --> 00:58:07,362
Lifted footage of the search party
from Frankenstein was later inserted

863
00:58:07,447 --> 00:58:12,316
in The Bride of Frankenstein, The
Mummy's Tomb and House of Dracula.

864
00:58:13,247 --> 00:58:16,637
If Frankenstein had been made
just a year or two later,

865
00:58:16,727 --> 00:58:21,278
at this point we would be listening
to rousing music underscoring.

866
00:58:21,367 --> 00:58:24,837
We're no longer on the back lot,
but on one of Universal's sound stages

867
00:58:24,927 --> 00:58:30,843
with plaster rocks and a cyclorama in the
background representing an ominous sky.

868
00:58:30,927 --> 00:58:35,443
A cyclorama, incidentally, that had
some problems, as you will soon notice.

869
00:58:35,527 --> 00:58:39,042
Incidentally, director James Whale
described this chase

870
00:58:39,127 --> 00:58:42,563
as "the pagan sport
of a mountain manhunt".

871
00:58:42,647 --> 00:58:45,923
Note that the wounded man
is character actor Francis Ford,

872
00:58:46,007 --> 00:58:49,886
who earlier had been a Universal
writer, director and leading player.

873
00:58:49,967 --> 00:58:52,845
He was director John Ford's older brother.

874
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:56,525
During the First World War,
in the British army,

875
00:58:56,607 --> 00:58:59,280
Whale was in
a prisoner-of-war camp in Germany,

876
00:58:59,367 --> 00:59:03,246
where he directed and acted
in plays for his fellow prisoners.

877
00:59:03,327 --> 00:59:06,444
Later he abandoned his job
as a cartoonist for a London newspaper

878
00:59:06,527 --> 00:59:09,246
to become a full-time theatre person -

879
00:59:09,327 --> 00:59:13,843
actor, director, set and costume designer
and stage manager.

880
00:59:13,927 --> 00:59:16,395
According to Whale biographer
James Curtis,

881
00:59:16,487 --> 00:59:20,958
the genesis of the look and interpretation
of Karloff in Frankenstein

882
00:59:21,047 --> 00:59:23,641
goes back to Whale's
highly praised performance

883
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:25,718
as the demented son of Charles Laughton

884
00:59:25,807 --> 00:59:30,597
in the London stage production
of A Man With Red Hair in 1928.

885
00:59:31,647 --> 00:59:34,605
Following Frankenstein,
Karloff worked with Whale again

886
00:59:34,687 --> 00:59:37,997
in The Old Dark House
and The Bride of Frankenstein.

887
00:59:38,087 --> 00:59:42,319
But after Son of Frankenstein
in 1939 with another director,

888
00:59:42,407 --> 00:59:45,080
he vowed never
to play the monster again,

889
00:59:45,167 --> 00:59:49,763
since he felt that the character
was becoming a clown or merely a prop.

890
00:59:49,847 --> 00:59:52,884
Despite the horror genre
going in and out of fashion,

891
00:59:52,967 --> 00:59:57,597
Karloff continued to make films, work
in television and appear in popular plays,

892
00:59:57,687 --> 01:00:00,724
such as Arsenic and Old Lace in 1941,

893
01:00:00,807 --> 01:00:04,197
and Peter Pan, as Captain Hook, in 1950.

894
01:00:05,047 --> 01:00:08,005
Near the end of his life,
Boris Karloff continued to work

895
01:00:08,087 --> 01:00:12,319
with half a lung,
crippling arthritis and a bad heart.

896
01:00:12,407 --> 01:00:16,082
He died in 1969 of respiratory problems.

897
01:00:16,847 --> 01:00:19,315
Unlike many actors
who played in horror films,

898
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:24,003
Karloff was always grateful for the
monster characters that built his career.

899
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:28,877
He once said of Frankenstein's monster
"God bless the old boy."

900
01:00:28,967 --> 01:00:31,845
"Without him,
I would have been nowhere."

901
01:00:33,367 --> 01:00:38,157
Here is the confrontation scene
between creator and creature.

902
01:00:38,247 --> 01:00:40,556
The obligatory scene.

903
01:00:41,887 --> 01:00:45,800
When the Laemmles
lost control of Universal in 1936,

904
01:00:45,887 --> 01:00:48,924
Whale's golden years at the studio
came to an end,

905
01:00:49,007 --> 01:00:53,046
following the release that year
of the extremely popular Show Boat,

906
01:00:53,127 --> 01:00:55,561
Whale's last major success.

907
01:00:55,647 --> 01:00:57,683
A few years later he retired from films

908
01:00:57,767 --> 01:01:01,396
and started painting
in his Pacific Palisades home.

909
01:01:03,527 --> 01:01:07,918
In 1957, his maid discovered Whale's fully
dressed body in the pool out in the back.

910
01:01:08,007 --> 01:01:12,444
There was an ugly gash on Whale's
forehead, and many suspected foul play,

911
01:01:12,527 --> 01:01:16,679
but ultimately it was revealed
that Whale committed suicide.

912
01:01:18,927 --> 01:01:23,079
It wasn't easy for Karloff in take after take
to carry Clive to the windmill

913
01:01:23,167 --> 01:01:27,877
and then up to the second level with all
that heavy paraphernalia that he had on.

914
01:01:27,967 --> 01:01:32,358
And certainly his physical conflicts
were difficult for the same reason.

915
01:01:32,767 --> 01:01:36,726
The exteriors of the windmill,
built on the back lot at Universal,

916
01:01:36,807 --> 01:01:42,677
were a combination of a full-scale lower
structure of 12ft and an upper miniature.

917
01:01:42,767 --> 01:01:47,636
The Williams travelling matte process
was used to effect overlapping elements.

918
01:01:47,727 --> 01:01:51,117
The original plan was
to have the monster seek the mill,

919
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:54,404
the only refuge it knew
from the time its life began.

920
01:01:54,487 --> 01:01:59,163
This was before the laboratory in the mill
was switched to the old watchtower.

921
01:02:00,287 --> 01:02:05,566
Budgeted at $262,000
and given a 30-day shooting schedule,

922
01:02:05,647 --> 01:02:09,560
Frankenstein had been laid out to film
in continuity for the most part,

923
01:02:09,647 --> 01:02:12,639
starting on August 24th.

924
01:02:12,727 --> 01:02:17,243
The schedule ran over by five days and
shooting was completed on October 3rd.

925
01:02:17,327 --> 01:02:21,445
Final cost: $291,000.

926
01:02:22,407 --> 01:02:28,243
The film was previewed at the Granada
Theatre, Santa Barbara, on October 29th.

927
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:32,081
When it started playing
in theatres in late 1931,

928
01:02:32,167 --> 01:02:37,878
Frankenstein did sensational business
and garnered generally excellent reviews.

929
01:02:37,967 --> 01:02:43,325
The New York Times called it
"Far and away the best thing of its kind."

930
01:02:43,407 --> 01:02:46,399
The New York American
told how it held its audience

931
01:02:46,487 --> 01:02:49,877
"in hypnotic thrill
through every sequence".

932
01:02:49,967 --> 01:02:56,281
And the World-Telegram
referred to it as "a singularly fine picture".

933
01:02:56,367 --> 01:03:01,282
Several local censor boards ordered cuts
to be made before it was shown,

934
01:03:01,367 --> 01:03:03,801
even though
the Production Code Administration,

935
01:03:04,967 --> 01:03:07,686
the film industry's self-regulatory body,
had passed it.

936
01:03:07,767 --> 01:03:11,806
Czechoslovakia, Italy, Sweden,
Belfast and South Australia

937
01:03:11,887 --> 01:03:14,685
rejected the film outright,

938
01:03:14,767 --> 01:03:17,839
and England made
a considerable number of cuts.

939
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:23,001
But Frankenstein was breaking
house-attendance records all over the US.

940
01:03:23,087 --> 01:03:26,284
It made the New York Times
ten-best list for the year.

941
01:03:27,407 --> 01:03:31,161
Exploitation gimmicks that go back
to Grand Guignol presentations

942
01:03:31,247 --> 01:03:34,523
in the 1920s and perhaps earlier
were resurrected -

943
01:03:34,607 --> 01:03:39,556
ambulances stationed at the front
of theatres, nurses on duty in the lobby,

944
01:03:39,647 --> 01:03:41,956
free nerve tonic, and so on.

945
01:03:42,047 --> 01:03:45,881
Motion Picture Herald
stated that the film had arrived

946
01:03:45,967 --> 01:03:51,599
"if the psychologists can be believed,
at the familiar psychological moment".

947
01:03:51,687 --> 01:03:57,319
"People like the tragic best at those times
when their own spirits are depressed,

948
01:03:57,407 --> 01:04:02,561
and the economists tell us that even
more than their spirits are at a low ebb."

949
01:04:02,647 --> 01:04:06,196
Motion Picture Herald
stated that the film had arrived

950
01:04:06,287 --> 01:04:11,805
"if the psychologists can be believed,
at the familiar psychological moment".

951
01:04:11,887 --> 01:04:16,915
"People like the tragic best at those times
when their own spirits are depressed,

952
01:04:17,007 --> 01:04:22,718
and the economists tell us that even
more than their spirits are at a low ebb."

953
01:04:22,807 --> 01:04:28,245
The reference to the economists was
referring to 1931-32 being the worst years

954
01:04:28,327 --> 01:04:30,318
of the Great Depression.

955
01:04:30,927 --> 01:04:33,805
In 1937, when Universal
submitted Frankenstein

956
01:04:33,887 --> 01:04:39,166
to the considerably tougher Production
Code Administration for reissue approval,

957
01:04:39,247 --> 01:04:41,556
a number of deletions were ordered.

958
01:04:42,287 --> 01:04:45,882
The official letter to the studio said:

959
01:04:45,967 --> 01:04:51,439
"Remove 'ln the name of God' and
'Now I know what it feels like to be God."'

960
01:04:51,527 --> 01:04:57,284
"Shorten views of Fritz with lighted torch
rousing the fear and fury of the creature."

961
01:04:57,367 --> 01:04:59,927
"Eliminate view of doctor jabbing
hypodermic into back of creature."

962
01:05:01,847 --> 01:05:06,796
"Eliminate scene in which the creature
throws the child into the water."

963
01:05:07,887 --> 01:05:12,881
The ending of the film was changed at
the last moment before its opening dates.

964
01:05:12,967 --> 01:05:16,755
Up to this time it was intended
that both Frankenstein and his creation

965
01:05:16,847 --> 01:05:21,443
would die at the conclusion of the film,
as in the Webling/Balderston play.

966
01:05:21,527 --> 01:05:25,042
Reaction at the previews
caused Universal executives

967
01:05:25,127 --> 01:05:27,038
to decide on a new ending,

968
01:05:27,127 --> 01:05:30,164
which necessitated the filming
of a short epilogue

969
01:05:30,247 --> 01:05:33,637
depicting Henry Frankenstein
recovering from his injuries

970
01:05:33,727 --> 01:05:35,445
and reunited with Elizabeth,

971
01:05:35,527 --> 01:05:38,599
while his father, the baron,
and the maids drink a toast

972
01:05:38,687 --> 01:05:41,884
to "a son of the house of Frankenstein".

973
01:05:41,967 --> 01:05:46,404
The ending was written by Whale
and scenario editor Richard Schayer.

974
01:05:46,487 --> 01:05:50,958
Colin Clive was on his way to Europe,
so another actor was used instead.

975
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:53,277
And Mae Clarke
could have been substituted,

976
01:05:53,367 --> 01:05:56,120
based upon the staging of the single shot.

977
01:05:56,207 --> 01:05:57,959
Frederick Kerr, as the baron,

978
01:05:58,047 --> 01:06:02,245
reappeared from his prolonged absence
from the footage.

979
01:06:02,327 --> 01:06:06,002
The prologue with Edward Van Sloan
was also a late addition.

980
01:06:18,007 --> 01:06:23,559
The closing music is "Grand
Appassionato" by Giuseppe Becce.

981
01:06:23,647 --> 01:06:27,196
He was a composer of short orchestral
mood pieces for motion pictures.

982
01:06:27,287 --> 01:06:31,997
In fact, he was the innovator of
the library of mood music for orchestra.

983
01:06:32,087 --> 01:06:34,760
And this selection goes back to the '20s.

984
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:37,842
This is Rudy Behlmer.

984
01:06:38,305 --> 01:06:44,928
