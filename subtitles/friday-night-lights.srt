00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,655
It's Mojo Radio back on the air.
Slammin'Sammy here.

3
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:14,890
Football time in Texas.
Let's go to the phone.
We got, uh, Butch on the line with us.

4
00:01:14,925 --> 00:01:17,455
Butch, what about it?
We'll have a great year, or what?

5
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,495
How you doin'?
Good, Butch.
Tell me about this season.

6
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:25,530
We're gonna
have a hell of a season this year.!
Winchell's gonna take us all the way.

7
00:01:25,565 --> 00:01:29,810
- Deep slant tripps stacked right?
- Primary receiver's inside flanker.

8
00:01:29,845 --> 00:01:32,490
- "Z" burst.
- "My linemen are an 80 pass block."

9
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:35,530
- How deep is your drop?
- Five steps.

10
00:01:35,565 --> 00:01:38,215
Five steps.
Tripps stacked left?

11
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,690
Inside eight-yard curl.
You gonna get a scholarship?

12
00:01:41,725 --> 00:01:45,930
Yes, Mom.
"Z"receiver.

13
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:52,010
It's Mojo Radio, Slammin'Sammy,
and I've gotJerry on the line with us
from the Sonic down there.

14
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:55,970
Jerry, there's a lot of talk
that Coach Gaines,

15
00:01:56,005 --> 00:01:58,015
"with that $60,000 a year salary"...

16
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:02,610
I know where we're goin'with this.
He makes a little bit more
than the principal of the school.

17
00:02:02,645 --> 00:02:06,170
"I read the book"..."Just last week,"
I was readin'this book about Babe Ruth,

18
00:02:06,205 --> 00:02:08,855
and they asked him
ifhe deserved his salary...

19
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:14,175
"way back in 1910"... "04, whatever it was,"
"and he said, "Hey, you know"...""

20
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:19,090
They said, " You make more than
the president. "He says," Well, you know,
can the president hit a baseball?"

21
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:24,290
I'm tellin'you right now, you know,
Coach Gary Gaines, they could give him
$ 100,000 a year,

22
00:02:24,325 --> 00:02:28,215
and if these boys go undefeated,
it's worth every single dollar.

23
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:32,095
I tell you what, the principal,
uh, of Permian
"don't get 28,000 people"...

24
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:36,410
I got two
to three seconds of rotation and
my linemen are an 80 pass block.

25
00:02:36,445 --> 00:02:40,135
Wide receiver?
He runs the... burst route.

26
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:45,570
If he sees cover two, he...
he bends outside, eight to 12 yards.

27
00:02:45,605 --> 00:02:48,290
20 yards, and runs
straight to the sideline.

28
00:02:48,325 --> 00:02:51,210
Are you ready for this, Mike?

29
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:42,370
- Yo. Ivory!

30
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,615
Ready to work?

31
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,730
'Sup, Boobie? State.

32
00:03:48,765 --> 00:03:51,615
State? State?

33
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,370
State. State.
State.

34
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,610
Where your girlfriend at, Water Bug?

35
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,575
"Well"...
We ain't got a girlfriend yet?

36
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:16,570
- Come on. Let's go. Snap it up.
- "You wanna know why"
you ain't got a girl yet, Water Bug?

37
00:04:16,605 --> 00:04:20,610
- Why?
- You got the wrong shoes on, man.

38
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:27,575
You got on white Adidas.
Everybody know the shoe is Nikes.

39
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,215
Nothin' holds a nickel next to Nike.
Ask Ivory. Ask Preacher Man.

40
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:35,130
- What kind of shoes
on your feet don't matter.
- Come on, Preacher. Bullshit!

41
00:04:35,165 --> 00:04:38,770
- Don't matter at all.
- "You know God made black beautiful."

42
00:04:38,805 --> 00:04:42,175
God made Boobie beautiful,
black and strong.

43
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:45,495
His mouth keeps gettin'
bigger and bigger and bigger.

44
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:50,450
And when Boobie knocks some fools out,
Boobie gonna knock 'em out with
black Nikes on his feet. Ain't that right?

45
00:04:50,485 --> 00:04:52,495
I could knock you out
in a pair of flip-flops.

46
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:55,970
Yeah, well, I'm gonna knock 'em out
with Nikes on my feet,

47
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:57,930
and I'm gonna smile when I do.

48
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,970
Let's go. Five minutes. Let's go.

49
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,570
Get up. Let's go.

50
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:14,570
How y'all doin' up there?
Y'all doin' all right?

51
00:06:14,605 --> 00:06:18,495
"45, Boobie"...
That's my nephew out there.

52
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,975
The boy can play some football.
I'm telling you.

53
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:24,130
I think he'll win
the Heisman Trophy someday.
The Heisman, really?

54
00:06:24,165 --> 00:06:26,607
- Oh, yes sir. You can bet on it.
- "I got it.! I got it.!"

55
00:06:26,642 --> 00:06:29,926
Who's you guys'favorite player?
- Boobie Miles.

56
00:06:29,961 --> 00:06:33,210
He can spin left. He can spin right.
Don't make no difference.

57
00:06:33,245 --> 00:06:37,290
He can block, tackle,
score the touchdown, snap the ball,

58
00:06:37,325 --> 00:06:39,855
hold the snap
and kick the extra point.

59
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:44,690
Hell, the boy will fill up
the Gatorade cooler, walk the dog,
and paint your back porch.

60
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:50,290
I'm telling you, that boy
can flat out play football.

61
00:06:50,325 --> 00:06:55,255
Ow! And he can pass!

62
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,695
Should we believe the hype?
What hype?

63
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:02,690
- The hype about Boobie Miles.
- "No, hype is something"
that's not for real.

64
00:07:02,725 --> 00:07:05,210
"I'm all real."

65
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:11,370
I'm Chris Comer. I'm a running back.
So that means you're Boobie's backup?

66
00:07:11,405 --> 00:07:14,335
I'm actually Boobie's backup backup.
I'm third string right now.

67
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:17,610
- "You know which way"
you're supposed to run?
- "Yeah, with strong right"...

68
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:20,530
I ain't talkin' about the play.
I know what the play was, okay?

69
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,210
I know what the play was, okay?

70
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,295
Odessa's a small town, and, uh,

71
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,295
if you screw up,
everybody knows about it.

72
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:32,090
Your dad played at Permian.
What's it like to be the son
of a local legend?

73
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,810
Hold on to the damn ball, Donnie!

74
00:07:34,845 --> 00:07:37,295
Next question.

75
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:40,970
There it goes.! There it is.!
How are your grades, Boobie?

76
00:07:41,005 --> 00:07:43,015
I get straight A's.
I'm an athlete.

77
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:47,010
In what subject?
There's only one subject.
It's football.

78
00:07:47,045 --> 00:07:49,730
- Ain't no other subject,
you know?
- Hut!

79
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,610
"Hang on to the ball.! The ball.!"

80
00:07:54,645 --> 00:07:57,410
You sure he's part of
your gene pool, Charlie?

81
00:07:57,445 --> 00:07:59,495
Shit.

82
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,495
Red alert.
Red alert, everybody.

83
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:07,010
What about the expectations
of coaching a team like this
in a community like this?

84
00:08:07,045 --> 00:08:10,650
Well, I guess there's always
a surprise or two in every community.

85
00:08:10,685 --> 00:08:13,490
Ball. Just concentrate on
hangin' on the ball. Both hands.

86
00:08:13,525 --> 00:08:15,735
Hey, Donnie. Hey.

87
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:20,015
- Come here. Come here.
What's the problem?
- "Get off the field, Dad."

88
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:23,590
Why can't you hold on to the football?
What's so goddamn hard
about holdin' on to it?

89
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:27,130
- I'm sorry.
- All you gotta do is hold on to the
goddamn football, and you can't do it.

90
00:08:27,165 --> 00:08:30,970
Tell me why you can't do it.
Just tell me. That's all I wanna know.

91
00:08:31,005 --> 00:08:33,655
I'll try better next time.
Come on.
Hey!

92
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,735
Charlie.!
Don't you walk away from me.

93
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:39,650
- Leave him alone.
- "Don't you walk away from me"
when I'm talkin'to you, you hear me?

94
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,930
Tell me why you can't
hold on to the ball.!
Enough.!

95
00:08:41,965 --> 00:08:43,975
Tell me. Answer a question.
Mr. Billingsley.

96
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:47,250
- It's the first day of practice.
- This is practice. Seriously.

97
00:08:47,285 --> 00:08:49,927
Enough. Charlie!

98
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:52,570
Embarrassin' me out here.
Jesus Christ.

99
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,570
It's all right, Don.

100
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,535
It's all right.
Don't worry about it. Here we go.

101
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:06,410
Slot right. 38...
Billingsley, you ain't gotta worry
about holdin' on to the ball, man.

102
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:09,295
- Why's that?
- 'Cause you ain't gonna get the ball.

103
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,410
Your job is to be blockin' for Boobie.
I don't care if your daddy
is over there cryin'.

104
00:09:13,445 --> 00:09:15,575
- You can...
- You never shut up, do you?

105
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:19,890
Our team's been playin'with each other
for a long time and, uh,

106
00:09:19,925 --> 00:09:22,255
we got the brotherhood
part of it down pretty much.

107
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:27,690
People here at Permian are already
predicting a state championship.

108
00:09:27,725 --> 00:09:30,055
Is there any pressure to that
for you guys?

109
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:34,170
Well, any time they start predictin'
the state championships,
there's always pressure, believe me.

110
00:09:34,205 --> 00:09:38,010
You guys don't have a lot of size.
How can you make up for that?

111
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:42,135
We're gonna rely on our speed,
discipline.

112
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:46,250
Come on, Ivory.
You're in the game now.
You're in the game.

113
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,770
Do football players
get special treatment here?

114
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:55,410
What do you have to do
to be a better football player this year?

115
00:09:55,445 --> 00:09:57,490
Do you enjoy playing football?

116
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,615
You quit reading
your press clippings, all right?

117
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:07,210
Because you're smaller,
and you're gonna be smaller every week.

118
00:10:07,245 --> 00:10:09,855
- Yo, Boobie Miles!
- It is hard to be humble.

119
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:13,050
Ain't gonna be no growth spurt
between now and the first game.

120
00:10:13,085 --> 00:10:15,130
Where does all that anger
come from?

121
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:20,030
- They're gonna underestimate you
every single week.

122
00:10:20,065 --> 00:10:23,570
- We teach you this technique
for a reason.

123
00:10:23,605 --> 00:10:26,890
We do not do this
to make our heads rattle.

124
00:10:26,925 --> 00:10:29,255
You're gonna use your mind.

125
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,410
You're gonna play with your heart.
Come on.!

126
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:37,090
That's what you're gonna use
to win the state championship.

127
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:44,490
Get up, Ivory. Get up.
Get up! Get up.

128
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:56,135
It's a good day, gentlemen.
It's a good day to think
about responsibility.

129
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:59,730
It's a good day to ask yourself
if on a personal level you're willing
to accept that...

130
00:10:59,765 --> 00:11:02,210
if you're willing to accept
the responsibility that you have...

131
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:06,610
to protect this team
and this school and this town.

132
00:11:06,645 --> 00:11:09,495
And make no mistake
about it, gentlemen,

133
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,930
we are in the business
of protecting this town.

134
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,855
We're in the business
of winning.

135
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,890
The expectations
couldn't be any higher.

136
00:11:18,925 --> 00:11:22,667
We will win state.

137
00:11:22,702 --> 00:11:26,410
We will win state.

138
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,810
Can you be perfect?

139
00:11:40,465 --> 00:11:43,657
Mojo.!

140
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:49,010
No, I'm all right.
Come on, Mike. Live a little.

141
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,815
He's not going out, either.
Yeah, he is.

142
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:56,170
Mike, you're going out tonight.
If I have anything to say about it,
you're gonna get laid too.

143
00:11:56,205 --> 00:12:00,490
Billingsley.! Billingsley.!
"Party at Taylor's house" now, "Billingsley.!"

144
00:12:00,525 --> 00:12:04,890
You better be there. Gonna get wasted.!
Party at Taylor's house.!

145
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:07,170
Billingsley!

146
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:12,850
Isn't that guy, like, 35?

147
00:12:12,885 --> 00:12:15,695
Mike. Here's your mom's food.

148
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:18,750
How much?
No, no. Don't worry about it.
It's on us. It's on us.

149
00:12:18,785 --> 00:12:21,735
How's she doin', by the way?
You never give me free food, David.

150
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:24,890
- "I just gave you free food."
- Oh yeah. Oh yeah, I forgot about that.

151
00:12:24,925 --> 00:12:27,810
- Say hi to your mom, huh?
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

152
00:12:27,845 --> 00:12:29,975
Stay out of jail, Billingsley.

153
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,910
- We're not goin' home, Mike.
- I ain't goin' out drunk foolin'.

154
00:12:32,945 --> 00:12:35,775
How 'bout I bring
your mom some dinner
so you can come out with us?

155
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:39,890
Because we're gonna get laid,
and we're gonna get drunk, and
we're gonna win state, but not tonight.

156
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,890
All right?

157
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:48,095
You been blessed, Mike,
'cause we got a runner.

158
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:51,935
He's gonna make us all look good.
So I'm telling you to lighten up.

159
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:57,290
All you gotta do is exist in those
two seconds between snap
and you givin' Boobie the ball.

160
00:12:57,325 --> 00:13:00,130
So lighten up, Mike.
Mike.

161
00:13:00,165 --> 00:13:03,415
How you doin'?
Hey, Brian.

162
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,250
How's old Gaines treatin' you?
Got you all perfect?
We gettin' there.

163
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,415
All right.
How's your mama?
Fine, sir.

164
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:12,610
- All right. You mind if we get a shot
real quick with the kid, little picture?
- Shot?

165
00:13:12,645 --> 00:13:14,575
Yeah, little picture.
Yeah, sure.

166
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:17,055
Here. All right, sweetie.
Just take a picture.

167
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:21,290
My baby girl and the next Texas
state championship quarterback, huh?

168
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,895
Where's the damn camera?

169
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:28,370
Winchell, boy, you remember
every minute of this.
I'm tellin'you right now.

170
00:13:28,405 --> 00:13:32,730
You're 17, but it goes fast.
Don't sleep. Don't waste a second of it.

171
00:13:32,765 --> 00:13:35,535
'Cause before you know it,
it's done.

172
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:38,655
Nothin' but babies and memories.
You hear me?

173
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:43,690
Babies and memories.
Smile, sweetheart. Give us a smile.
Say "Mojo." Say "Mojo."

174
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:49,210
I tell you what, why don't
you hold on to her for a little while?
Babysit her for us for a couple hours.

175
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,047
We're gonna go get a drink.
We'll be back in a little bit.

176
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:55,326
All right. I'm kiddin' with ya.
Come here. Come here, sweet...

177
00:13:55,361 --> 00:13:58,570
Come here, sweetie.
Let's go back over to Mama.
All right.

178
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:02,250
Thank you. Thank you.
Hey, hey. Bring it home, huh?

179
00:14:02,285 --> 00:14:05,967
Bring one of these home.
Get you one of these.

180
00:14:06,002 --> 00:14:09,650
Christian, get you one of these.
Boys? Right here.

181
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:17,650
Come up here a second.
Got some change for you.

182
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:25,890
Wanna go to that party?
Just for a little bit?

183
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:32,130
*It's tricky to rock a rhyme
To rock a rhyme that's right on time *

184
00:14:32,165 --> 00:14:35,535
*It's tricky
It's tricky, tricky *
*Tricky, tricky *

185
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:38,930
*It's tricky to rock a rhyme
To rock a rhyme that's right on time *

186
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:42,735
*It's tricky *
* T-t-t-tricky, tricky *

187
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:45,370
*I met this little girlie
"Her hair was"..."*

188
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:51,970
What I saw was speed out there,
but uh, where's the beef, Coach?

189
00:14:52,005 --> 00:14:54,487
I saw me some small boys.
They're small.

190
00:14:54,522 --> 00:14:56,935
- I think we're gonna be okay.
- On defense?

191
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:01,130
Yes, ma'am. I firmly believe that.
We got some backs.
We're about, what, 180?

192
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,215
* Tricky, tricky, tricky *

193
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:10,290
*It's tricky to rock a rhyme
To rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's tricky *

194
00:15:10,325 --> 00:15:12,335
Hi, Mike.

195
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,935
I'm Melissa.
I know who you are.

196
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:17,290
You do?
Everybody knows
who you are, Melissa.

197
00:15:17,325 --> 00:15:20,610
Everybody knows
who you are, Mike.

198
00:15:20,645 --> 00:15:22,490
Is that right?

199
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:26,095
- Whole lot of... Arab oil embargo.
- " Oh, God."

200
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:29,050
- Don't talk about that.
- Midland Lee likes to bust it
up the middle, too.

201
00:15:29,085 --> 00:15:32,207
You're right about that.
You know what you should do?

202
00:15:32,242 --> 00:15:35,175
You should play Boobie Miles defense.
Work him both ways.

203
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:38,970
The problem with that is
I don't want to get him hurt.
We need him to score touchdowns.

204
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:41,535
Bullshit. That big nigger
ain't gonna break.

205
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:45,175
You wanna beat Midland Lee,
you play him middle linebacker.

206
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,850
- Break some heads out there.
- Are you ready for Midland Lee, coach?

207
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:54,455
*I got a letter from the government
The other day
I opened and read it *

208
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:59,610
This is not about Boobie. This is
about the fact that we're sittin'here
in the stairwell while they're up there.

209
00:15:59,645 --> 00:16:02,907
- I wanna be with a ball carrier.
- Baby, Boobie is...

210
00:16:02,942 --> 00:16:06,135
Don't you "Baby, Boobie" me.
I wanna see somethin'.

211
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:09,170
Can I get a touchdown?
How 'bout that?
Can I get a touchdown?

212
00:16:09,205 --> 00:16:12,930
Why don't you have a girlfriend?
I don't know.

213
00:16:12,965 --> 00:16:15,330
Why doesn't he have a girlfriend?

214
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,650
Is that a rule or somethin'?

215
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:26,610
No, not really.
Well, then,
why don't you have a girlfriend?

216
00:16:26,645 --> 00:16:29,387
Just don't.
Are you gay?

217
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:32,130
- What?
- Is he gay?

218
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:37,495
- "I'm not gay."
- Can you prove it?

219
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:42,970
Coach, here's to the start of
your second season as our head coach.

220
00:16:43,005 --> 00:16:46,887
- We're here,
we believe in you and Sharon.
- Thank you.

221
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:50,770
To sittin' here in December
as the state champions ofTexas.

222
00:16:50,805 --> 00:16:53,455
- Let's bring 'em hell. Go Mojo!
- Go Mojo!

223
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,375
- Go Mojo!
Bring us some glory, Coach.

224
00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:01,530
- "* That's what I say"
Don't need nothin'but a good time *
- Go! Go! Go!

225
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:09,730
Why isn't anyone allowed
at your house?

226
00:17:09,765 --> 00:17:12,467
People come over.

227
00:17:12,502 --> 00:17:15,170
When?

228
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,330
Is your mother really crazy?

229
00:17:19,365 --> 00:17:22,690
No.

230
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:24,850
Are you crazy?

231
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,175
Do I look crazy?

232
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:32,170
Look like someone who's gonna get
the hell out of Odessa, Texas one day
and never look back.

233
00:17:32,205 --> 00:17:35,610
Seriously works for me.

234
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:49,770
See ya.

235
00:17:57,605 --> 00:17:59,535
Get in here, boy.

236
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:03,010
Come on. Get this off.
Ow.

237
00:18:03,045 --> 00:18:06,450
That's good.

238
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,895
Ow!

239
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:12,490
Take my shoes...

240
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:25,010
Don't get so prude.
Stop. We're on your couch.

241
00:18:25,045 --> 00:18:28,850
Something for everybody. Oh.

242
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,375
Let's go to your room.

243
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:37,810
Let's go to your bedroom.
Dad, can you just go
back to bed, please?

244
00:18:37,845 --> 00:18:40,130
Who's this? This Melissa?

245
00:18:40,165 --> 00:18:42,575
Yes.
Maria.

246
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:46,890
How you doin', Maria?
Damn, girl. You have grown up.

247
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:49,810
Dad, please.
Can you just go back to bed?

248
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,615
What happened to my lamp?

249
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:58,250
- "Hey, y'all. What's goin'on?"
- Hey, Flippy.

250
00:18:58,285 --> 00:19:00,215
Hi, Maria.
What happened to my lamp?

251
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:04,055
I dropped it.
Yeah, you dropped it.

252
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:09,930
That makes perfect sense, huh?
He dropped it. Can't hold on to
the lamp, can't hold on to the football.

253
00:19:09,965 --> 00:19:13,450
- I can hold on to the football, Dad,
now get the hell out of here!

254
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:19,930
Little fumble,
can't hold on to the football.

255
00:19:19,965 --> 00:19:23,027
Since when can you hold
on to the football?

256
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:26,055
I haven't seen it.
Y'all don't do it today?

257
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:29,850
How about yesterday? You hold on
to the football yesterday? Have you
seen him hold on to the football?

258
00:19:29,885 --> 00:19:33,370
How 'bout tomorrow?
You gonna hold on to it tomorrow?
How 'bout now?

259
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:35,770
Can you hold on...
Hold on to the football.
Goddamn it, Dad.

260
00:19:35,805 --> 00:19:40,135
- "Dad."
- Maybe this'll help.

261
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:44,210
What are you doing?
Hold... on... to... the football!

262
00:19:44,245 --> 00:19:47,147
Dad! Goddamn it, Dad!
Knock it off!

263
00:19:47,182 --> 00:19:50,176
"That's enough.!"

264
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:59,450
I don't think we've felt this kind of
expectation in years.

265
00:19:59,485 --> 00:20:01,375
If Winchell shows up
like we know he can,

266
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,970
even a short passing game
to give Boobie Miles
"a couple of feet of cushion"...

267
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:24,250
You boys all right?
Yes, sir.

268
00:20:24,285 --> 00:20:26,695
Yes, sir.

269
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:29,050
Gonna win state?
Yes, sir.

270
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,890
Yes, sir.
Undefeated?

271
00:20:31,925 --> 00:20:34,615
Yes, sir.
Get it done.

272
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,410
Take this opportunity
"to support the Permian Panthers"...

273
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:51,850
"The Southern California lifestyle
is but one of the bonus features...

274
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,215
"of playing for"...""

275
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,135
What's that word?
Uh, "distinguished."

276
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:04,690
- Who's that one from, UCLA?
- No, this is USC.
That's UCLA right there.

277
00:21:04,725 --> 00:21:10,210
Hey, Mike. You gonna come visit
my distinguished ass in California?

278
00:21:10,245 --> 00:21:12,410
See if I can put the damn smile
on your face.

279
00:21:12,445 --> 00:21:15,175
You know I'm fittin'
to be rich, right?

280
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:19,890
I'm thinkin'about hiring,
uh, Eddie Murphy
to lay some ofhis shit on you...

281
00:21:19,925 --> 00:21:21,855
till you crack a damn smile.

282
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:25,490
No? Well, what about
Richard Pryor?

283
00:21:25,525 --> 00:21:28,815
Bill Cosby?
I know you like Bill Cosby.

284
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:32,530
Mike Winchell, you got
a natural ability...

285
00:21:32,565 --> 00:21:34,975
for throwing Boobie Miles the ball.

286
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:39,090
Any every once in a while
you throw a pretty good pass,

287
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,250
so you're going to eat
yourJell-O Pudding Pops.

288
00:21:41,285 --> 00:21:43,890
Wah!

289
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:50,330
Yo, Mike Winchell. You gonna move
out of Odessa, Texas one day, baby,

290
00:21:50,365 --> 00:21:53,050
and you gonna come visit
Boobie Miles in California,

291
00:21:53,085 --> 00:21:56,335
and you gonna smile,

292
00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:00,295
or I'm gonna stick
about four pudding pops
up your white ass.

293
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:03,890
- "Now, now"... "Oh, my God.!"
I got Mike Winchell to smile.!

294
00:22:03,925 --> 00:22:06,655
Look at this! Wah!

295
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:10,015
Did y'all see it? Wah.!

296
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:12,850
That's probably the only smile
y'all gonna see from Mike
all season.

297
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:17,095
Yeah. Yeah.

298
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:19,530
I'm distinguished now.
Hey, Boobie.

299
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:23,015
- What?
- You didn't lift.

300
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,455
Come on, man.
This is God-given.

301
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:29,530
Only thing I gotta do
is just show up.

302
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:36,530
Now, people call this monument out here,
the Ratliff Stadium,

303
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:39,175
the monument to football of Odessa.

304
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:43,170
They say some of that money
should have gone to the school.

305
00:22:43,205 --> 00:22:47,570
What's your feelings on that, D.U.?
You played ball.

306
00:22:47,605 --> 00:22:49,695
Ain't that stadium
part of the school?

307
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:53,690
So I say that money did go to the school.
What's everybody whinin'about?

308
00:22:53,725 --> 00:22:56,410
This is football country, folks.
Come on. Get your heads out.

309
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:00,455
Hi, Don.
Hey, Karen.

310
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:04,130
- It's you. Do you like it?
Do you like it?
- Think so. What is it?

311
00:23:04,165 --> 00:23:06,930
Rice Krispy.
You like it, right?
Yeah, I love it.

312
00:23:06,965 --> 00:23:09,650
Thanks.
You're welcome.

313
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:14,330
- "Hey, Gary?"
- Hey, John. How you doin'?

314
00:23:14,365 --> 00:23:16,695
Good. Um, you real busy?

315
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:19,295
I got a minute or two.
What you got up?

316
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:23,090
- Well, I got some characters out here.
- Well, who you got with you?

317
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:26,027
Wilkins.
Well, hey.
Hey, Jim. How you doin'?

318
00:23:26,062 --> 00:23:28,895
- How's that pretty wife of yours?
- She's good.

319
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:31,815
Ready for Friday night?
Sure hope so.
Seems pretty good.

320
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:34,450
I feel pretty good about it.
I really do.
" We'rejust, uh"...

321
00:23:34,485 --> 00:23:36,495
Wanted to come by and visit,

322
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:39,170
maybe talk about defense
a little bit, if you got a second.

323
00:23:39,205 --> 00:23:41,095
You got a second?

324
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:45,375
We got a dog named Mojo.
We got a cat named Panther.

325
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:49,735
You got season tickets?
You kiddin'?
We don't miss anything.

326
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:55,290
- Instead of the cover 2 zone.
- "Get the D-line in as many gaps"
and stack gaps as possible.

327
00:23:55,325 --> 00:23:57,967
Double dent, type of technique.

328
00:23:58,002 --> 00:24:00,466
- " Hey, Boobie."
- Hey.

329
00:24:00,501 --> 00:24:02,930
- How you doin'?
- "All right."

330
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:06,735
Strong "B"slide force.
"Hell, we can look at"...

331
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:09,570
- He'll still be a robber...
- Get Ivory out of the board...

332
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,295
- And go!
- Go, go, go, go.

333
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:17,610
- "Go by the speed and make up"
"for the size differential"...
- What do you think, Coach?

334
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:28,910
Now, obviously we're not Division I,
but we got a good program.

335
00:24:28,945 --> 00:24:34,490
You play well enough,
we'll find you a spot at Kansas Wesleyan.

336
00:24:34,525 --> 00:24:38,415
- How far is the drive?
- What drive?

337
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:42,330
To your school. How far is it
from Odessa to your school?

338
00:24:42,365 --> 00:24:45,250
I don't know. 10 or 12 hours.
Are you offering?

339
00:24:45,285 --> 00:24:47,090
Ma'am?
Right now. Are you offering?

340
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:48,770
If you are, we're in.
Mom.

341
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:51,135
He'll sign his intent right now.

342
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:56,170
Well, obviously we're interested,
Miss Winchell, otherwise
we wouldn't be here, Mike.

343
00:24:56,205 --> 00:25:00,130
- But right now, that's all we are, is...
- Interested.

344
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:03,335
Now, you go get at 'em,
you throw some touchdowns,

345
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:06,710
you win some football games,
maybe a state championship, huh?

346
00:25:06,745 --> 00:25:10,050
We'll see if we can't find you a home
at Kansas Wesleyan.

347
00:25:10,085 --> 00:25:12,175
Yes, sir.

348
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,770
Do you like playin' football, Mike?
Yes, sir.

349
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,970
Is it fun for you?

350
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:22,295
- Lots of fun, sir.
- He loves the game.

351
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:25,250
That's good. It's important.
It's... legitimate love of the game.

352
00:25:25,285 --> 00:25:27,727
Supposed to be fun,
you know?

353
00:25:27,762 --> 00:25:30,170
Greatest game in the world.

354
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:38,655
I'm not that good at toastin;
but, uh, I'll give it a try.

355
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:43,610
Um, fact is I don't know if I've ever
done a toast myself before.
Been involved in a few, but uh...

356
00:25:43,645 --> 00:25:47,735
"Uh, well, here's to Boobie Miles, who"...

357
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:51,930
"Well, everything"... "everything you get"
this year, you deserve it,

358
00:25:51,965 --> 00:25:55,655
because you... you work hard,
and you... I'm real proud of you.

359
00:25:55,690 --> 00:26:00,690
"And, um, L. V., to you l"... "I can't"
even tell you how proud of you I am,

360
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:04,570
the way you've raised this kid
"and what you do for him, and uh"...

361
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:08,810
Here's to a great season,
and uh, God bless us.

362
00:26:08,845 --> 00:26:10,930
- God bless us.
- God bless.

363
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:15,935
We been thinkin'about this
for four months now.

364
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:20,730
You seniors have been
thinkin'about it for 17 years.

365
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:23,650
Well, it's here now.
It's time.

366
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:27,695
If any of you have any doubt
in your mind,

367
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:30,295
I don't want you to walk
through that door over there.

368
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:36,490
You shouldn't have any doubt
in your mind about what
you're supposed to do tonight,

369
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:40,010
and about how
you're supposed to do it.

370
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:47,010
So let's take care of it!

371
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:52,530
*Don't know we can do this
'Cause we always knew this *

372
00:27:52,565 --> 00:27:55,615
*Ha, ha
Yeah, boy *

373
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,935
*Bass
How low can you go *

374
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:00,770
- "*Death row"
What a brother know *
- Way to go.

375
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:02,450
- Do you understand?
- Hut!

376
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:05,415
Boobie Miles.

377
00:28:07,985 --> 00:28:10,415
You can't turn it back
to Boobie Miles!

378
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:13,690
All Boobie, all the time here.

379
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:17,970
"A Mojo first down."

380
00:28:18,005 --> 00:28:20,015
Boobie around one more.!

381
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:22,970
- Yeah! That's my boy!
- "Boobie Miles for 45 yards"...

382
00:28:23,005 --> 00:28:25,975
"Score for Mojo. Touchdown."

383
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:29,730
Billingsley takes it right.
Boobie. Here we go again.

384
00:28:29,765 --> 00:28:32,855
Into the end zone.
Touchdown, Mojo.

385
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:36,610
Boobie Miles has it all,
"all in one great package"...

386
00:28:36,645 --> 00:28:39,735
the speed, the size, the athleticism.

387
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:42,690
Let me tell you, folks, Boobie Miles
is worth the price of admission.

388
00:28:42,725 --> 00:28:44,530
Yeah!
Yeah, all right!

389
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:47,770
- "Boobie Miles breakin'loose"
one more time.
- Yes, sir!

390
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:51,850
- Broke the line.
Chavez.!

391
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:56,730
Chavez is playin'like a man possessed.

392
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:00,375
Whoo!

393
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:03,775
- God damn, I'm so proud of ya!
- Calm down, son.

394
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:06,730
- Chavez will eat you...
Billingsley. Hey, Billingsley.

395
00:29:06,765 --> 00:29:09,770
Whoo!
Go sit...
Go get on the bench.

396
00:29:09,805 --> 00:29:11,735
Get on the bench.
Boy, crazy.

397
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:15,090
I like enthusiasm, but my goodness.

398
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:22,170
He's gonna throw it.
"What an arm.! Did you see"...

399
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:28,850
Boobie Miles, from 35 yards out,

400
00:29:28,885 --> 00:29:30,775
scores a Mojo touchdown.

401
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:34,570
You're doin' a great job.
Give me a smile. Give me a smile.
Thank you, Coach.

402
00:29:34,605 --> 00:29:37,575
Boobie Miles is about as solid
as you can ask for.

403
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:41,370
He ain't gonna smile.
He's more internal.
Why not? Why didn't he ever smile?

404
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:43,295
Mojo.! Mojo.!
Keep watchin'out.

405
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:47,210
- Let me kick that extra point.
- Not this time. You did enough.

406
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:52,970
- " Come on."
- Chris Comer! Come in.

407
00:29:53,005 --> 00:29:56,015
Comer! You're in the game.
Come on.

408
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:59,230
Hey, hey, hey, hey, son. Come here!
Come here! Where you goin'?

409
00:29:59,265 --> 00:30:02,410
- You don't want me to go in, Coach?
- You don't want a helmet?

410
00:30:02,445 --> 00:30:04,575
Where's your helmet?
Go get it!
Yes, sir!

411
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:07,895
- "You see my helmet, man?"
- Find your helmet, son.

412
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:11,570
- What you lookin' for, Water Bug?
- Let me get this real quick.
Let me get your helmet, man.

413
00:30:11,605 --> 00:30:14,455
Come on, come on.
My goodness gracious.

414
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:17,530
Boobie.
Water Bug, you can't come out here
with no helmet, man.

415
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:20,850
You seen my helmet right here?
I can't believe it.

416
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:23,215
28 sweep. 28 sweep.

417
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:27,530
You don't know where your helmet is?
What are you thinkin'?
Where did you put your helmet?

418
00:30:27,565 --> 00:30:30,415
- Right there a second ago.
- Well, it ain't there!

419
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:33,170
Do you not know that you
play the game with a helmet on?

420
00:30:33,205 --> 00:30:35,130
- "Put your tail end right there.!"
- Hut!

421
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:38,490
He throws back to Miles.

422
00:30:38,525 --> 00:30:41,370
Miles cuts to his right.

423
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:46,970
Bailey takes him down.

424
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:57,130
Was that a knee?
Could have been.

425
00:30:57,165 --> 00:30:59,730
Hold on. Hold on.

426
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:16,730
Winchell
was still in there. Billingsley was
still in there. Unfortunately...

427
00:31:16,765 --> 00:31:21,810
the running back's been taken down hard
"and it looks like a knee could possibly"...

428
00:31:21,845 --> 00:31:25,810
Just gonna touch the kneecap here.

429
00:31:25,845 --> 00:31:28,090
Does it hurt over here, son?

430
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:34,010
Get up, Boobie.

431
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:43,410
Let me take a look at this.
Let me look at it.

432
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:04,650
It's definitely his A.C.L.
I mean, it's a legitimate tear.

433
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:10,730
Do you think he tore any cartilage?
Maybe. I could feel the knee catching.

434
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:15,530
What do you think?

435
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:18,850
This kid, it's all about
how he responds mentally.

436
00:32:18,885 --> 00:32:21,130
I don't know.

437
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:41,050
All right, everybody.
Listen up.

438
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:48,850
He's gonna be fine.
It's not serious. There's no tear.
He'll be back in a week.

439
00:32:48,885 --> 00:32:51,855
That's the good news.

440
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:54,290
Even better news, y'all played
a great football game tonight.

441
00:32:54,325 --> 00:32:56,370
A real good football game.

442
00:32:56,405 --> 00:32:59,407
I'm real proud of ya.

443
00:32:59,442 --> 00:33:02,410
And Mike...
Where's Mike Winchell?

444
00:33:02,445 --> 00:33:04,975
Mike, I'm proud of you, son.

445
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:08,130
You showed discipline.
You showed leadership.

446
00:33:08,165 --> 00:33:11,187
You played your butt off, son.
I'm proud of you.

447
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:14,175
All of you. Proud of all of you.
And, uh, Wilson...

448
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:17,530
Now that's body tackle.
That's what I been tellin'you about.

449
00:33:17,565 --> 00:33:19,610
Did y'all see him tonight?

450
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:26,490
Anyway, I'm proud of every one of you.
I'm proud of the coaches, all of y'all,
each and every player.

451
00:33:26,525 --> 00:33:30,770
I want you to go celebrate.
Feel good about yourselves
tonight, okay? Come on!

452
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:52,650
We only got
a minute and a halfleft in the game,
we're leadin'by a good lead.

453
00:33:52,685 --> 00:33:56,175
He leaves the boy in there like that.
That makes no sense.!

454
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:59,410
You gotta protect your best asset.!
What's the matter with this man?

455
00:33:59,445 --> 00:34:01,495
He could have ruined
the whole season for us right there.

456
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:04,695
We were up. We were winnin'big,
and the boy stays in the game.

457
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:08,930
"Yeah.! What's"... "You don't need any more."
You don't need to accomplish any more.

458
00:34:08,965 --> 00:34:12,335
I think Coach Gaines
"is a stupid f"..."in'idiot."

459
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:16,010
Hey.
" Well, he sh"... "You know,"
he shouldn't have put him in.

460
00:34:16,045 --> 00:34:18,427
I mean, we had a big lead
and everything.

461
00:34:18,462 --> 00:34:20,775
I don't understand
what that was all about.

462
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:23,930
We can't do anything without Boobie.
"We had the game won"...

463
00:34:23,965 --> 00:34:26,895
I'm feelin'some damage
on the right side here.

464
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:31,130
- "Well, can I play on Friday?"
- I think you got a slight tear.

465
00:34:31,165 --> 00:34:33,610
Can he play?
Yeah, can I play?

466
00:34:33,645 --> 00:34:36,210
Can he play football?

467
00:34:36,245 --> 00:34:38,290
Can I?

468
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:42,570
You need to get up to Midland,
get an M.R.I.

469
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:47,370
Can a M.R.I. fix your knee?

470
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,655
Is he the one player
you can't do without?

471
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:55,810
Well, l... I never looked at it
that way. A football team is not
about one player or two players.

472
00:34:55,845 --> 00:34:57,775
A football team is about the team.

473
00:34:57,810 --> 00:35:01,130
This is a unit, and that's
the way we have to play.

474
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:04,450
"Uh, it's gonna be a"...
It's gonna be a challenge.

475
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:17,490
You are makin'
some bad decisions!

476
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:23,650
You're playin'like the village idiot.
You want people to think you're
the village idiot? Is that what you want?

477
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:40,375
The Eagles take down
the Panthers, 49-6,

478
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:43,390
and for Coach Gary Gaines,
it's gotta be back to the drawing board.

479
00:35:43,425 --> 00:35:46,335
That's gonna be the word
around town all week.

480
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:51,570
Coach Gaines, what are you gonna do?
The loss of Boobie Miles can not
result in the loss of this season.

481
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:11,170
Hell of a game.
Gimme the keys.

482
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:15,330
Way to take care ofbusiness.
Gimme the keys, Dad.

483
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:30,690
We, uh... We just need
a few more days, Coach,
and we be back.

484
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:33,775
You go into Midland,
get that M.R.I.?

485
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:38,530
I don't need nothin'in Midland.
Those rich hillbillies ain't never seen
nothin'as pretty as Boobie Miles.

486
00:37:38,565 --> 00:37:40,930
Them M.R.I. machines
wouldn't know what to do with it.

487
00:37:40,965 --> 00:37:44,015
He gonna be just fine, Coach Gaines.

488
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:47,810
Uh, we gonna go back to the clinic
but they already said ain't no tears.

489
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:52,490
No tears?
Ain't no tear.

490
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:56,295
Is that what they said?

491
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:59,535
Yes, sir. Uh, we gonna go back
for some double confirmation,

492
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:05,290
but when it come time
to play Midland Lee,
we be good to go, Coach.

493
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:09,250
That's good, then.

494
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:27,610
He designed his offense
around one player.

495
00:38:27,645 --> 00:38:30,375
We're dead.
We're not dead.

496
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:33,850
- We just need to start
throwin' the football.
- We're dead.

497
00:38:33,885 --> 00:38:35,330
Dead. Pull it.

498
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:42,730
We gotta lighten up. We're 17.

499
00:38:42,765 --> 00:38:46,127
Do you feel 17?

500
00:38:46,162 --> 00:38:49,375
I don't feel 17. Pull it.

501
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,530
We will win state.

502
00:38:52,565 --> 00:38:54,575
Chavo, you're like a human pinata.

503
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:58,890
You get your ass all beat on
more than anybody I know,
and you just sit there and spit out candy.

504
00:38:58,925 --> 00:39:02,187
That's 'cause he's out ofhere.
He's got the grades.

505
00:39:02,222 --> 00:39:05,295
No matter what, if we win or lose,
he knows he's gettin' out.

506
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:09,290
- "He's like the one foot"
out the door man.
- "It's true, Chavo."

507
00:39:09,325 --> 00:39:12,330
You're gonna be
drinkin'martinis,
Gimme the gun.

508
00:39:12,365 --> 00:39:14,375
eatin'lamb chops,
gettin'manicures.

509
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:18,690
You're just jealous.
Removin' your freakin' shoes.

510
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:31,055
What's it like being the quarterback?

511
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:33,610
I mean, this is a big responsibility
for a 17-year-old kid.

512
00:39:33,645 --> 00:39:36,647
No.! That is not acceptable.!

513
00:39:36,682 --> 00:39:39,650
Uh... It's sort of... I mean, uh...

514
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,975
It's not too bad. I know, uh...

515
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:48,290
- " You are playin'like a fool.!"
- " Do you think"
you can handle it?

516
00:39:48,325 --> 00:39:51,410
If you got a receiver
gettin'jammed inside,
what will you do with your brain?

517
00:39:51,445 --> 00:39:54,730
Yeah, I hope so.
What will your brain do?

518
00:39:54,765 --> 00:39:56,730
- You'll throw outside!
- Throw it outside.

519
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:59,010
You'll throw outside!
Now you think you can do that?

520
00:39:59,045 --> 00:40:02,050
- Yes, sir.
- Well, show me.
Show me!

521
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:12,215
Hey.

522
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:16,650
Yeah, well, I thought
maybe if you came home
it would help out a little bit.

523
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:20,810
She's sick.
She's not doin' so good.

524
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:26,295
It's just kinda hard.
Football's startin' and this is a lot.

525
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:30,410
Well, I thought if maybe you could
come home, it'd help out a little bit,

526
00:40:30,445 --> 00:40:32,490
'cause she's your mother, too.

527
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:42,490
Okay. Okay.

528
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:45,530
Okay.

529
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:57,170
Can you get the job done, Mike?

530
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:05,730
We're pretty small.
I didn't ask you
if you think we're small.

531
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:10,530
I asked you if you think
we can get the job done.

532
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:16,250
Think so.
Well, you're gonna have to do better
than "I think so."Is that clear?

533
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:20,495
It's clear.

534
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:25,210
Now I'm gonna assume
that by now you've learned
that the world's not fair...

535
00:41:25,245 --> 00:41:27,810
and sometimes
you get the short end.
That's all you get.

536
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:32,090
And if you don't do
something personally to fix it,

537
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:36,370
that's all you're ever gonna get.

538
00:41:36,405 --> 00:41:38,570
Yes, sir.

539
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:49,255
Mike.

540
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:58,690
Do you wanna play college ball?
Do you wanna get out of this town?

541
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:04,010
Think so.

542
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:08,050
Well, why aren't you
doin' something about it?

543
00:42:08,085 --> 00:42:13,370
My mind's not right.

544
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:29,850
One of these days you're gonna
have to get out of this house.

545
00:42:29,885 --> 00:42:32,250
You're gonna have to leave her.

546
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:36,210
Yes, sir.

547
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:41,210
You gotta accept the fact that
people have to take care of themselves,
and that includes you.

548
00:42:41,245 --> 00:42:43,810
You understand that?
Yes, sir.

549
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:48,375
Okay. The truth is,

550
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:52,670
against some
pretty overwhelming odds,

551
00:42:52,705 --> 00:42:56,930
if... if you do decide to accept that...

552
00:42:57,770 --> 00:42:59,970
Look at me, Mike.

553
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:04,450
If you decide to accept that,

554
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:09,770
you're gonna seriously fly, son.

555
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:25,810
Same song, different
verse. Middle of the second quarter,
Cooper has a 14-nothing lead.

556
00:43:25,845 --> 00:43:28,375
Things are really going south
in a hurry.

557
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:34,450
But when you got an offense play
built around one player, that's great,
as long as the player's there.

558
00:43:34,485 --> 00:43:37,135
When he gets hurt,
in this case like Boobie Miles did,
what do you do?

559
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:40,610
I don't know, but Gaines
better come up with a plan quick...

560
00:43:40,645 --> 00:43:42,575
'cause the unthinkable's
gonna happen.

561
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:45,055
The Panthers are gonna lose
two consecutive district games.

562
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:49,050
Wilson gets the hand-off and he's
got room to run on the left-hand side.

563
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:52,375
Across the line. Clotheslined.!

564
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:55,850
- "And he's down.!"
- Gimme a running back!
We got a running back?

565
00:43:55,885 --> 00:43:58,130
Permian has lost Boobie Miles,
now Wilson,

566
00:43:58,165 --> 00:44:00,175
Comer! Comer!
Yeah, come on!

567
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:03,450
leaving him with third-string
running back Chris Comer.

568
00:44:03,485 --> 00:44:06,935
- Hut!
- "Comer around the right side,"

569
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:09,370
has some room to run and...
runs out ofbounds.

570
00:44:09,405 --> 00:44:11,855
What is that?

571
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:15,210
- I didn't have a block.
- You are so dumb! Are you scared?

572
00:44:15,245 --> 00:44:17,255
I didn't have no block.
Football is a contact sport!

573
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:20,650
I think he's a sophomore.
May be lookin'for
a badminton scholarship or something.

574
00:44:20,685 --> 00:44:22,575
That's not gonna cut it.

575
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:26,535
"Blue 40.! Hut.!"

576
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:29,375
The snap. Lookin'to throw.
Here comes the rush.

577
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:34,930
Winchell avoids the rush,
throws the ball,
Comer turns from blocker to receiver.

578
00:44:34,965 --> 00:44:39,090
Has the ball, crosses the 20-yard line,
crosses the 30.

579
00:44:39,125 --> 00:44:41,975
Comer to the 40.! Comer to the 50.!

580
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:45,570
- "Where did this speed come from?"
- Go, go, go!

581
00:44:45,605 --> 00:44:48,335
- "Who was that?"
- It was Comer.

582
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:51,610
- Our Comer?
- It was Comer. It was Comer!

583
00:44:51,645 --> 00:44:55,415
Comer has a Mojo touchdown.!

584
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:58,810
Chris Comer with his first varsity T.D.

585
00:44:58,845 --> 00:45:00,770
Not letting go of that ball.
Gimme the ball.

586
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:05,450
- "85 yards, the second-longest"
power play in Permian history.
- Gimme the ball. Gimme the ball!

587
00:45:05,485 --> 00:45:07,970
Interception, Brian Chavez.!

588
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:13,370
Abilene Cooper back to punt.
It's blocked.!

589
00:45:13,405 --> 00:45:16,055
Touchdown, Permian.!

590
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:19,295
- "That's a Mojo touchdown."
- Jesus!

591
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:22,770
- "Billingsley up the middle,"
picks up a great block from Comer.
- Run, Donnie!

592
00:45:22,805 --> 00:45:27,215
Forearm shove behind him,
in for the Mojo touchdown.

593
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:29,970
There's your old school football.

594
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:34,210
* Oh yeah *

595
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:37,670
* Got my Mojo working, baby *

596
00:45:37,705 --> 00:45:39,495
Where did this guy come from?

597
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:44,450
Chris Comer afforded
a couple of fantastic runs
and one fantastic pass reception,

598
00:45:44,485 --> 00:45:46,410
leading Mojo from a 14-nothing deficit.

599
00:45:49,285 --> 00:45:51,295
Hello?

600
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:54,935
I'm feelin'great. How are you?
I feel much better than I did
before the hit.

601
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:58,410
This team has a swagger. They're
walkin'tall. They're playin'tough.

602
00:45:58,445 --> 00:46:00,655
I love these kids.
I love the way Winchell's playin;

603
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:03,610
Real good. They came
"together after Boobie went out"...

604
00:46:03,645 --> 00:46:07,250
He's got him.
Touchdown in the corner.!

605
00:46:07,285 --> 00:46:09,050
You know,
we just have to dig deep...

606
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:11,735
Comer's amazing. You know,
he's stepping in just nicely.

607
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:15,810
My concern is that he doesn't
have the experience in the long run.

608
00:46:15,845 --> 00:46:18,487
If they can just stay strong,
not get overconfident,

609
00:46:18,522 --> 00:46:20,975
and take out Midland Lee
I think we're goin; man.

610
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:24,170
I think we're gonna go all the way,
but I'm a little worried.

611
00:46:24,205 --> 00:46:26,850
Oh no, sir.
It's just a small sprain.

612
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:31,615
It was just, uh, a precaution.
We're on a roll.

613
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:35,290
Don't get started
on the celebration dance.
We got Midland comin'up.

614
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:37,055
Midland Lee is the real deal.

615
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:40,410
You don't need to be slackin'right now.
You gotta be playin'and practicin;

616
00:46:40,445 --> 00:46:44,370
Permian zips past
North Shore Galena 17-3.

617
00:46:44,405 --> 00:46:47,695
Come on. We're five and one.
The team is winning now.

618
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:50,850
They all win, but who we playin'?
Come on. Mediocre teams.

619
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:56,990
Two losses could shut the door
on the Permian Panthers.

620
00:46:57,025 --> 00:47:00,295
Let's not start tootin'the horns
just yet, you know what I mean?

621
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:05,530
You lose two division games
in this football climate,
and you're done, Sammy. You're done.

622
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:14,490
Midland.
Boobie.

623
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:18,890
This the best damn hospital
in Texas.

624
00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:22,010
The very best.

625
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:55,050
My son, Andrew, played for Midland,
and ended up back East at Penn.

626
00:47:55,085 --> 00:47:57,467
Oh, he playin' with,
uh, Joe Paterno.

627
00:47:57,502 --> 00:47:59,850
University of Pennsylvania.
Uh, premed.

628
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:03,610
Oh.
Just let it relax.
You have any pain?

629
00:48:03,645 --> 00:48:05,807
Not at all.
Does this hurt?

630
00:48:05,842 --> 00:48:07,935
Nope.
None of that hurts?

631
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:11,310
Nope.
Okay. Go ahead and sit up and
just let your legs hang over the side.

632
00:48:11,345 --> 00:48:14,650
In fact, why don't you
go ahead and get dressed
and let me look at the scan.

633
00:48:14,685 --> 00:48:17,535
l-I'm sorry.
You'reJames' dad?

634
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:21,330
No, I'm his uncle.
"Come over and let me"...
let me look at the scan with you.

635
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:24,295
Uh, this is the scan
wejust did today ofhis knee...

636
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:27,570
and this is looking right
through the middle of the knee.

637
00:48:27,605 --> 00:48:30,535
What we're looking at
right through here is... is the A.C.L.,

638
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:35,690
and what this shows is that
he's had a fairly significant,
fairly serious injury.

639
00:48:35,725 --> 00:48:38,055
James, let me show you.
Right through here
is where the injury is,

640
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:42,210
and it looks like you've had
a pretty serious injury
to that part of your knee.

641
00:48:42,245 --> 00:48:46,330
Significant enough that...
that I have concerns about
what you can do from here on.

642
00:48:46,365 --> 00:48:48,290
So when can I suit up?

643
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:55,690
Well, let me just say with how
your knee felt when I examined it
and what I see on the scan...

644
00:48:55,725 --> 00:48:58,695
"With"... "with the"...
"the things that you do well"...

645
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:01,650
The reason that you're great
is that you can run and cut
and hammer people...

646
00:49:01,685 --> 00:49:04,335
and you don't hesitate
because you've got a solid knee.

647
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:08,410
When you don't have this ligament,
you can't do that,
so it's really out of the question.

648
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:11,347
What? No, no, no. That's...
That's not what Dr. Spencer said.

649
00:49:11,382 --> 00:49:14,250
He said three weeks.
Three weeks is up,
and I'm ready to play.

650
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:16,815
I understand. I understand,
but again, when l...

651
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:20,610
Based on what I see
when I feel your knee, examine
your knee... What I see here...

652
00:49:20,645 --> 00:49:23,650
You... You really can't play
with this kind of knee.

653
00:49:23,685 --> 00:49:26,727
What are you talkin'
about, I can't play?
I'm gonna play.

654
00:49:26,762 --> 00:49:29,770
I'm ready to play.
My team needs me.
I'm ready to play.

655
00:49:29,805 --> 00:49:31,735
Listen to me.
I am listenin' to you.

656
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:33,815
"l- I want"...
I want what's best for you.

657
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:37,090
You and I
are on the same page...
We ain't on the same page.!

658
00:49:37,125 --> 00:49:39,135
How you gonna want
what's best for me?
Hold on. Hold on.

659
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:42,290
How you gonna want
what's best for me?
You from Midland, right?

660
00:49:42,325 --> 00:49:45,387
You from Midland? Huh?
This is bull, man.

661
00:49:45,422 --> 00:49:48,415
You just jealous
'cause you from Midland.

662
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:51,890
What I recommend...
You jealous 'cause you from Midland.
Who paying you?

663
00:49:51,925 --> 00:49:53,850
- Who paying you?
- Come on, Boobie. That's okay.

664
00:49:53,885 --> 00:49:56,535
You tryin' to take
my football career!

665
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:59,575
You tryin'to take
my football career.!
Boobie, let's get out ofhere.

666
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:03,130
Tryin'to take my football career.!
Whatever you're sayin' to me,
listen to me.

667
00:50:03,165 --> 00:50:05,130
Come on!
Pig!

668
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:09,375
Here back on Mojo Radio,
it's Slammin'Sammy Stands.

669
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:12,575
I knew tonight's game was gonna
be a big game, but itjust got bigger.

670
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:17,330
Earlier today, Cooper beat Woodland,
which means that if Permian wins tonight,
they're in the play-offs.

671
00:50:17,365 --> 00:50:21,370
"If they" lose", though, they fall back"
into a three-way tie for first place,

672
00:50:21,405 --> 00:50:24,930
and that means the tie-breaker
is a coin toss.

673
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:28,570
So what'd the doctor say?

674
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:37,650
'Cause, see, if you go out there
before your knee's ready...
Coach, my knee's fine.

675
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:44,210
You okay with this, L.V.?

676
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:47,850
Yeah, I'm good with it.
Hundred percent.

677
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:53,170
Go get dressed.

678
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:04,010
The most storied rivalry
in the state of Texas...

679
00:51:04,045 --> 00:51:08,307
is Permian hosting
the Midland Lee Rebels
at Ratliff Stadium.

680
00:51:08,342 --> 00:51:12,536
Tonight one of these teams
could take a step toward the play-offs.

681
00:51:12,571 --> 00:51:16,730
Permian has one district loss,
both Cooper and Midland Lee have two.

682
00:51:16,765 --> 00:51:18,655
There's no doubt about that.

683
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:22,050
A win tonight puts
Permian in the play-offs,
no coin flip needed,

684
00:51:22,085 --> 00:51:25,135
plus it'll send the Lee Rebels
home for the season.

685
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:29,570
Well, what
do you know, folks. Look at this
coming out of the locker room.

686
00:51:29,605 --> 00:51:31,495
Number 45 has emerged
from the locker room.

687
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:34,250
Boobie doesn't look like
he's limping at all.

688
00:51:34,285 --> 00:51:37,867
He looks good to me.
He looks like he's ready to go.

689
00:51:37,902 --> 00:51:41,450
Now the question is, decoy or player?

690
00:51:41,485 --> 00:51:43,575
He ain't gonna play.
I don't think so either.

691
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:48,610
From what I know
about Coach Gary Gaines, nobody
holds his cards closer than Gary does.

692
00:51:48,645 --> 00:51:53,210
- Come on, guys. Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!
- "Hut.!"

693
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:57,655
Winchell pitches to Comer.
Flipped on his head.!

694
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:01,770
Winchell, pressured by Olivera,
"swings a pass out to Billingsley"...
Picked off!

695
00:52:01,805 --> 00:52:06,970
It's Dominguez.
Dominguez will take it in
from 25 yards away.

696
00:52:07,005 --> 00:52:09,015
And Lee brings home points.

697
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:12,055
Hang on to the ball, son!

698
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:15,375
Don't worry about it.
Shake it off. Shake it off.

699
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:20,210
Don't worry about it, Coach.
Let me spin. Let me spin, Coach.

700
00:52:20,245 --> 00:52:22,170
Y'all wanna win, put Boobie in.

701
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:24,255
Set. Hut.! Hut.!

702
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:27,290
- " Winchell"
will swing it out to Billingsley.
- Come on, Donnie.

703
00:52:27,325 --> 00:52:30,175
And the ball is tripped
by Dominguez.

704
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:34,050
- "Kevin Lane, and a blatant"
body slam by Billingsley.
- Donnie! Donnie!

705
00:52:34,085 --> 00:52:37,410
What's up?

706
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:43,570
My goodness. Son, is there
something wrong with you?
Are you mentally okay?

707
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:49,655
What are you
puttin' your helmet on for?
Take your helmet off, son.

708
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:52,730
You're gonna sit on the bench
for a little while.
You don't need that helmet.

709
00:52:52,765 --> 00:52:55,615
Third down, with less than
two minutes to play in the half.

710
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:59,895
Strandler over the left side,
uncontested. 32 yards down to T.D.

711
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:04,490
Permian came in
with a four-game win streak
but they haven't been tested all year.

712
00:53:04,525 --> 00:53:07,530
Coach Gaines is gonna have to find
a way to get his offense on track...

713
00:53:07,565 --> 00:53:10,095
or start feeling his season
slipping through his fingers.

714
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:15,050
- "Do you think you're playin'football?"
Do you think you're playin'football?

715
00:53:15,085 --> 00:53:17,970
Do you think you're playin'football?
You are showing me nothing.!

716
00:53:18,005 --> 00:53:22,730
Do you understand me?
Do you think you got it made?

717
00:53:22,765 --> 00:53:25,667
Do you think you got it made?

718
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:28,535
Because if that's what you think,

719
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:32,650
you're gonna find out what
it feels like to sit on your asses...

720
00:53:32,685 --> 00:53:35,250
and watch Midland Lee
take your season!

721
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:47,330
No offense tonight for Mojo, and still
no sign ofJames "Boobie"Miles.

722
00:53:47,365 --> 00:53:51,375
Y'all wanna win? Put Boobie in.
I'm about to spin.

723
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:55,630
Come on, Coach. Come on, Coach.
Let me get this for you.

724
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:59,695
Under five minutes to play
and Lee still leads 14-7.

725
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:04,730
Weak defense, weak offense
and no Boobie. If you're
Coach Gaines, what do you do?

726
00:54:04,765 --> 00:54:07,970
Right now Mike Winchell
can't get this offense going,

727
00:54:08,005 --> 00:54:10,335
and the Midland coach
has seen Boobie on the sidelines.

728
00:54:10,370 --> 00:54:14,250
If you don't put him in,
he knows you're bluffing.
I'd put him in.

729
00:54:14,285 --> 00:54:17,170
All right. Move out!

730
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:33,090
Come on!

731
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:41,130
Boobie! You're in.
Let's go! Let's go!
What you want, yo?

732
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:49,655
Well, we apparently are all
gonna get what we wished for,

733
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:54,050
because here comes Boobie Miles,
and this is certainly
what the fans came to see.

734
00:54:54,085 --> 00:54:56,570
That's number 45
back in the Permian backfield.

735
00:54:56,605 --> 00:54:59,135
Back slam, 37 stretch...
Break!

736
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:03,330
Now Boobie the senior,
Number 45, lining up behind
quarterback Mike Winchell,

737
00:55:03,365 --> 00:55:07,410
and offensive line is rarin'to go
with room to run.

738
00:55:07,445 --> 00:55:10,055
Three, 12, hut.!

739
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:14,490
Miles going left.
Hesitates just a bit.

740
00:55:17,125 --> 00:55:19,370
Get off! Get off!

741
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:28,250
- Let's go with 60-Cheetah.
- 60-Cheetah!

742
00:55:28,285 --> 00:55:30,815
Let's go! Let's go!

743
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:35,010
They're gonna cheat up close
to the line again and see if they're
gonna run Boobie one more time.

744
00:55:35,045 --> 00:55:37,495
He will go to the right.
There is a hole.

745
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:41,770
He gets a block.
The Dominguez brothers take him down.
He spins and he's down.

746
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:50,415
Take it easy. Stay down.

747
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:53,770
Don't touch it.
Don't touch it.
Try to relax.

748
00:55:53,805 --> 00:55:56,170
Let me take a look at it.

749
00:55:57,410 --> 00:56:02,330
I'm gonna get up on my own.
I can get up on my own.

750
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:06,810
Folks, the utterjoy of watching
Boobie Miles trot back on to the field...

751
00:56:06,845 --> 00:56:10,735
has been replaced by the sheer misery
of watching him being carried off of it.

752
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:15,450
We unfortunately may have seen
the last of Boobie Miles
in the black and white of Permian.

753
00:56:15,485 --> 00:56:18,255
Let me see.
He's done.

754
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:20,770
We're gonna go jet fire, Coach.
Well, you better go somethin'!

755
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:24,295
One minute 35 seconds
left to play in this one.

756
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:27,215
Panthers move immediately
to the hurry-up offense.

757
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:31,730
Boobie
no longer a factor. Comer, following
the tackle, will dig up near midfield.

758
00:56:31,765 --> 00:56:35,807
The clock now inside of 1:20.
It'll be second down, Permian.

759
00:56:35,842 --> 00:56:39,850
Lee clinging to that seven-point lead
and time becomes a factor.

760
00:56:39,885 --> 00:56:42,850
- 60 Cheetah.
- 60 Cheetah! 60 Cheetah! Hut!

761
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:47,615
Again, Winchell to Payne,
beating Preston.

762
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:51,930
Only 40 seconds left.
Mike Winchell trying to keep
Permian's play-offhopes alive.

763
00:56:51,965 --> 00:56:54,850
- "Completes the pass."
- He's got it. He's got it.

764
00:56:54,885 --> 00:56:57,130
Winchell was drilled,
but he seems to be okay.

765
00:56:57,250 --> 00:57:01,210
- Back it off!
- "Winchell, past time, he's lookin;"

766
00:57:01,245 --> 00:57:05,170
Again, Winchell to Payne.
The clock continues to run.

767
00:57:05,205 --> 00:57:07,015
- "25 seconds left."
- Go, go!

768
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:21,330
Let's go! We got four up!

769
00:57:21,365 --> 00:57:23,010
Hold it.! Hut.!

770
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:28,930
Mike Winchell trying to keep
the play-offhopes alive. Complete.!

771
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:34,095
We gotta go with...

772
00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:36,850
This is for the ball game.
The clock is still moving.

773
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:42,890
Come on, front line!

774
00:57:44,770 --> 00:57:49,490
- "Mike Winchell will go for the shotgun,"
steps back and he drops the ball.!
- Pick it up! Pick it up!

775
00:57:49,525 --> 00:57:52,930
Picks it up, steps into the pocket,
looking for Allen Wyles, he's open.

776
00:57:52,965 --> 00:57:55,850
Here's the pass, and it's... too tall.!

777
00:57:55,885 --> 00:57:59,690
Midland Lee wins the ball game.

778
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:46,950
It's all right.
No, man.

779
00:58:46,985 --> 00:58:50,077
I'm sorry.
It's all right.

780
00:58:50,112 --> 00:58:53,170
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

781
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:57,535
Thanks for nothing, Permian.
Go home, cowards.

782
00:58:57,570 --> 00:59:01,535
I don't understand
what's gonna happen
"at this point. How do we"...

783
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:06,770
Another loss, and
that's thrown us into a three-way tie.
They're going to have a coin toss.

784
00:59:06,805 --> 00:59:08,815
You gonna be all right?
I'm okay.

785
00:59:08,850 --> 00:59:13,730
You're serious?
That's right. We're gonna get the three
coaches, they're all gonna toss a coin.

786
00:59:13,765 --> 00:59:16,415
I love you.

787
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:19,530
What the hell kind of way
is that to make a decision?

788
00:59:19,565 --> 00:59:22,610
When you assemble
the kind of talent that we have here,

789
00:59:22,645 --> 00:59:24,735
and then you just
throw it away like that.

790
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:28,055
It started with him playin'Boobie
when we had a big lead.

791
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:32,370
"And now"... "This is a once in a lifetime"
"thing to be able to see these people"...

792
00:59:32,405 --> 00:59:34,850
I mean, we could have
been in the history books.

793
00:59:34,885 --> 00:59:37,735
"And now? Ain't no way."

794
00:59:37,770 --> 00:59:40,570
I mean, that's it.
What about Winchell's play tonight?

795
00:59:40,605 --> 00:59:42,535
"Well, what do" you "think?"

796
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:46,450
"And that Billingsley couldn't hold on"...
They all suck.!

797
00:59:46,485 --> 00:59:48,335
And I think it
just goes to the coachin;

798
00:59:48,370 --> 00:59:50,550
That's what it is.
You know what else it is, too?

799
00:59:50,585 --> 00:59:52,730
They been doin'too much
learnin'in the schools.

800
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:59,010
My daddy used to take a bullwhip,

801
00:59:59,045 --> 01:00:01,690
and he'd cut it up...

802
01:00:01,725 --> 01:00:03,690
And he'd tie 13 knots in it.

803
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:09,770
Then he'd beat me
and beat me in my gut...

804
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:13,370
till I got a sick feeling in my stomach.

805
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:17,370
Well,

806
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:19,627
that's how I feel...

807
01:00:19,662 --> 01:00:22,236
when I watch "you..."

808
01:00:22,271 --> 01:00:24,160
play... football.

809
01:00:24,195 --> 01:00:26,015
Sick at my stomach.

810
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:28,330
Oh, I need some fresh air!

811
01:00:29,290 --> 01:00:32,410
- " Aah.!"
- "What the hell are you doing?"

812
01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:37,930
Get this sickness
out of my stomach.

813
01:00:37,965 --> 01:00:41,095
- Yeah.
- Goddamn it, Dad.

814
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:43,890
You were sent down here
to learn how to play football.

815
01:00:43,925 --> 01:00:45,655
And you haven't.

816
01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:48,775
You have not!

817
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:52,410
And I gotta take that
as a personal... failure!

818
01:00:54,370 --> 01:00:57,330
Nobody in Mojo football
wants to win in a coin toss.

819
01:00:57,365 --> 01:01:00,730
But that's the way
it is. That's the way
the tiebreaker is.

820
01:01:00,765 --> 01:01:02,575
Well, they oughta
change that.

821
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:05,250
They ought to change
"coaches"... "Make a lot"
of changes in executing.

822
01:01:10,930 --> 01:01:13,690
I was supposed to
make a man outta you.

823
01:01:13,725 --> 01:01:16,055
Shit.

824
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:19,210
You know what that is?
Do you know what that is?

825
01:01:19,245 --> 01:01:21,410
That's a state championship.

826
01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:26,650
I won a state championship.
Just calm down, Dad.

827
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:30,370
Can you touch that?

828
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:35,370
Can you... touch... that?

829
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:40,130
Can you... touch... that!

830
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:44,215
Hell with it.

831
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:47,410
What the hell are you doing?

832
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:56,210
You drunk bastard!

833
01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:08,055
You ever feel cursed, Coach?

834
01:02:08,090 --> 01:02:12,490
Like, no matter what,
inside your heart you feel
that you're gonna lose.

835
01:02:12,525 --> 01:02:14,735
Like something's
hanging over you,

836
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:19,250
following you like a witch
"or a demon thatjust"...
What is wrong with you?

837
01:02:19,285 --> 01:02:23,130
Why you gotta be
so messed up?
You can't win.

838
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:26,610
I feel like that all the time.

839
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:30,230
Even when things
are going good.

840
01:02:30,265 --> 01:02:32,737
When we're winnin',
it's there.

841
01:02:32,772 --> 01:02:35,210
And when we're losin',
it's there.

842
01:02:35,245 --> 01:02:37,690
What is wrong with you?

843
01:02:39,810 --> 01:02:42,970
It took me a long time
to realize that, uh,

844
01:02:46,450 --> 01:02:49,570
there ain't much difference
between winnin' and losin',

845
01:02:49,605 --> 01:02:52,010
except for how
the outside world treats you.

846
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:56,050
But inside you,
it's about all the same.

847
01:02:56,085 --> 01:02:58,130
It really is.

848
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:04,010
Fact of the matter is,
I believe that, uh,

849
01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:08,090
our only curses are the ones
that are self-imposed.

850
01:03:08,125 --> 01:03:09,975
You know what I'm sayin'?

851
01:03:10,010 --> 01:03:13,810
We, all of us,
dig our own holes.

852
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:18,010
God, Dad.

853
01:03:24,770 --> 01:03:27,570
*Breaks somebody's back **

854
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:37,030
What is wrong with you?

855
01:03:37,065 --> 01:03:39,410
What's wrong with you?

856
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:47,130
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is truly unbelievable.

857
01:03:47,165 --> 01:03:49,535
A three-way tie for first place.

858
01:03:49,570 --> 01:03:52,455
So, in less than an hour,
this truck stop,

859
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:55,650
which we're not allowed
to reveal the identity of,

860
01:03:55,685 --> 01:03:57,655
will serve as host for a coin toss...

861
01:03:57,690 --> 01:04:00,850
that will send two of these teams
to the state play-offs...

862
01:04:00,885 --> 01:04:03,535
and one of them home
empty-handed.

863
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:07,695
Okay, Skip. We're on
in three, two, one.

864
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:10,295
Folks, we're here with
the three winning coaches.

865
01:04:10,330 --> 01:04:13,670
Now, we've all agreed on
the rules. Two out of three
here, odd man out.

866
01:04:13,705 --> 01:04:16,975
If you got one tails, they're out.
If you got one heads, they're out.

867
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:20,690
It's a tough way after a great
season for these coaches, but
this is the way it's gonna be.

868
01:04:20,725 --> 01:04:23,255
When I give the word,
we're gonna toss our coins.

869
01:04:23,290 --> 01:04:26,370
And then the district's gonna
have its two representatives.

870
01:04:26,405 --> 01:04:28,775
Let's see the coins, guys.

871
01:04:28,810 --> 01:04:31,770
All right, uh,
Coach Doug McCutcheon
"from Abilene Cooper's got"...

872
01:04:31,805 --> 01:04:34,050
What is it, Coach?
A 1922 silver dollar.

873
01:04:34,085 --> 01:04:35,055
'22 silver dollar, all right.

874
01:04:35,090 --> 01:04:38,250
Coach Gary Gaines
from Permian, you got a...

875
01:04:38,285 --> 01:04:40,855
'69 nickel.
'69 nickel.

876
01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:45,570
And from Midland Lee,
"Coach Earl Miller's got a"... "Well,"
that's just your basic U.S. quarter.

877
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:49,650
Okay. Coaches ready?

878
01:04:49,685 --> 01:04:52,330
One.
Ain't no curses.

879
01:04:52,365 --> 01:04:54,210
Two.

880
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:58,090
Three. Toss 'em.

881
01:05:02,210 --> 01:05:04,810
"Coins are down."

882
01:05:04,845 --> 01:05:07,335
This one looks like it's heads.

883
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:11,010
Okay, that's heads
for Abilene Cooper.

884
01:05:13,205 --> 01:05:14,810
That's mine.

885
01:05:18,530 --> 01:05:21,015
It's heads.

886
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:23,330
Okay. Midland Lee
is also heads.

887
01:05:25,850 --> 01:05:28,330
Hey, we got a third one
over here, Skip.

888
01:05:28,365 --> 01:05:31,210
Coach, that's you.

889
01:05:33,890 --> 01:05:36,610
- Come on, Gaines.
- Come on.

890
01:05:41,090 --> 01:05:44,010
Don't touch that.
Just leave it alone.

891
01:05:48,850 --> 01:05:51,050
- Well, that's heads.
- Yup. That's heads too.

892
01:05:51,085 --> 01:05:53,450
Permian is also heads. Man.

893
01:05:53,485 --> 01:05:55,615
- Yeah.
- "Well, that figures."

894
01:05:55,650 --> 01:05:59,370
The way you guys'teams
played each other this year,
it'd take more than one toss, so...

895
01:05:59,405 --> 01:06:03,650
Hang on a second.
You know, this coin's pretty worn.

896
01:06:03,685 --> 01:06:05,175
Does this look like heads
to you, Doug?

897
01:06:05,210 --> 01:06:07,695
I can't tell the difference.
It might be tails.

898
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:11,410
Folks, there might be
some controversy here
regarding Cooper's coin.

899
01:06:16,610 --> 01:06:18,650
It's tails.

900
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:36,530
So, the good news is that life
continues for both Midland Lee
and Permian high schools.

901
01:06:36,565 --> 01:06:38,770
At least for another
couple of weeks.

902
01:06:38,805 --> 01:06:40,695
That's the good news.

903
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:46,290
The not-so-good news is
that it looks like all roads are
eventually leading to Dallas Carter.

904
01:06:46,325 --> 01:06:49,135
And what a monster of a team
Dallas Carter is.

905
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:52,455
This Dallas Carter team
appears to be completely
unstoppable.

906
01:06:52,490 --> 01:06:57,090
I mean, the rumor is they've got
nine players that have already signed
Division I letters of intent.

907
01:06:57,125 --> 01:06:58,610
Damn, them boys big.

908
01:06:58,770 --> 01:07:02,770
They are a very, very good
football team, people.

909
01:07:39,570 --> 01:07:42,890
I'll get that car fixed today.

910
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:46,770
Yeah.

911
01:07:50,730 --> 01:07:52,850
I don't want this to sound
like an apology,

912
01:07:53,010 --> 01:07:57,010
but, uh, I didn't mean
"half the things I said la"...
I know.

913
01:08:03,810 --> 01:08:08,330
You just...
You ain't gettin' it.

914
01:08:08,365 --> 01:08:11,175
You don't understand.

915
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:14,170
This is the only thing
you're ever gonna have.

916
01:08:16,170 --> 01:08:18,450
Forever,
it carries you forever.

917
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:30,370
It's an ugly fact of life.
Donnie, hell.

918
01:08:32,330 --> 01:08:36,210
It's the "only" fact of life.

919
01:08:37,650 --> 01:08:42,930
You got one year,
one stinkin'year to make
yourself some memories, son.

920
01:08:43,810 --> 01:08:46,810
That's all.
It's gone after that.

921
01:08:53,090 --> 01:08:55,850
And I'll be damned
if you're not gonna miss it.

922
01:09:16,810 --> 01:09:18,930
No guts.

923
01:10:08,090 --> 01:10:10,090
What's up, Water Bug?

924
01:10:10,170 --> 01:10:12,730
What's up, Boobie?

925
01:10:39,090 --> 01:10:41,055
Water Bug!

926
01:10:41,090 --> 01:10:44,570
Play-offs belong to you, baby.
I'll make you proud.

927
01:10:49,690 --> 01:10:51,690
What you all lookin' at?

928
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:56,450
Play your ass off!
Win state.

929
01:10:56,485 --> 01:10:58,850
Be perfect, all that shit.

930
01:11:05,570 --> 01:11:09,210
This is a gift for you.
It's gonna be worth
a lot of money.

931
01:11:09,245 --> 01:11:11,810
I bet it will.

932
01:11:17,290 --> 01:11:19,970
You be perfect,
Preacher Man.

933
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:26,735
What's up?

934
01:12:01,970 --> 01:12:05,810
Now what we gonna do?
I can't do nothin' else
but play football.

935
01:12:05,845 --> 01:12:07,655
Hey, hey.
Don't worry about that.

936
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:10,650
Don't worry about it?
I can't be doin' nothin' else.
You'll be all right, son.

937
01:12:10,685 --> 01:12:13,130
I can't do nothin' else
but play football.

938
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:18,450
Why? We practiced
and we practiced.
It'll be okay.

939
01:12:18,485 --> 01:12:21,415
You told me we were
gonna go to the pros.

940
01:12:21,450 --> 01:12:24,895
What the hell am I gonna do
without my knee?

941
01:12:24,930 --> 01:12:28,730
You'll find somebody else.
Don't worry about it, son.

942
01:12:28,765 --> 01:12:32,130
No! I wanted to buy you a house!

943
01:12:44,570 --> 01:12:48,370
They won't
let me play, though.!

944
01:12:52,930 --> 01:12:55,250
It's play-off time in Texas.!

945
01:12:55,285 --> 01:12:58,895
And who cares if Permian
snuck in on a coin toss?

946
01:12:58,930 --> 01:13:02,810
You know
there's been a lot of expectations
for this Permian football team.

947
01:13:02,845 --> 01:13:05,615
"And you" gotta "love"
this play-off atmosphere.!

948
01:13:05,650 --> 01:13:09,010
They call this
the thinning of the herd,
the survival of the fittest.

949
01:13:09,045 --> 01:13:11,250
Win, you go home.
Lose, you play basketball.

950
01:13:11,370 --> 01:13:15,490
Quarterback Mike Winchell.
Runs back, pulls right, throws long.

951
01:13:15,525 --> 01:13:17,855
- "Caught.! Touchdown.!"
- Whoo!

952
01:13:17,890 --> 01:13:22,570
The Panthers defeated Dallas Jesuit
to advance to round 16.

953
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:32,250
They're goin'to the 20,
to the ten, to the five.!

954
01:13:32,285 --> 01:13:35,807
It's Comer, folks,
into the end zone for
another Permian touchdown.!

955
01:13:35,842 --> 01:13:39,330
Chris Comer with another
sensational performance.!

956
01:13:39,365 --> 01:13:41,690
Permian cruises past San Angelo
"and into the quarter"...

957
01:13:41,725 --> 01:13:45,010
Permian was afraid of that.
"Dallas Carter"...

958
01:13:50,010 --> 01:13:53,170
Brian Chavez,
"a great reading player"...
Touchdown.!

959
01:13:55,450 --> 01:13:58,255
Permian defeats Nimitz
48-7.!

960
01:13:58,290 --> 01:14:01,850
Moving into the semi-finals
of the Texas 5-Aplay-offs.

961
01:14:05,170 --> 01:14:06,770
Advancing to the state finals.

962
01:14:09,130 --> 01:14:12,975
Mike Winchell drops back,
throws a 50-yard bomb.!

963
01:14:13,010 --> 01:14:16,530
It's gonna be caught by Parker.!
It's going out ofbounds.

964
01:14:16,565 --> 01:14:18,375
"What a good team"...

965
01:14:18,410 --> 01:14:21,730
And that's it. Permian's
gonna battle Dallas Carter...

966
01:14:21,765 --> 01:14:26,610
for the Texas Class 5-A
State Championship.!

967
01:14:30,610 --> 01:14:33,290
What would it take for you
to come up to Texas Stadium?

968
01:14:33,325 --> 01:14:36,127
How about if y'all come out here?

969
01:14:36,162 --> 01:14:38,735
Where?
Over at Ratliff Stadium?
Yeah.

970
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:41,410
I still think there'd be
a problem with our fans
sittin' with your fans.

971
01:14:41,445 --> 01:14:44,295
I don't see any problems.

972
01:14:44,330 --> 01:14:47,215
We can bring in
extra police to handle
the crowd-control issues.

973
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:51,330
Mr. McClary, perhaps
you're not aware, but we
have an all-black community.

974
01:14:51,365 --> 01:14:54,730
And frankly,
between our communities,
there are some issues.

975
01:14:54,765 --> 01:14:56,730
Wait a minute. What issues
are we talkin' about?

976
01:14:56,810 --> 01:14:59,610
You know, I'm not gonna
get into it at this table.

977
01:14:59,645 --> 01:15:01,690
It's just different.

978
01:15:04,810 --> 01:15:06,890
How about if we went
with a neutral site?

979
01:15:06,925 --> 01:15:09,890
Say College Station,
or San Anton;

980
01:15:09,925 --> 01:15:11,935
Somewhere like that?

981
01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:14,770
Or, you know
what we could do,

982
01:15:15,770 --> 01:15:18,770
is the Astrodome.

983
01:15:19,970 --> 01:15:22,295
Astrodome.

984
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:24,770
I got no problem
with that.
Good.

985
01:15:24,805 --> 01:15:26,895
Let's discuss officials.

986
01:15:26,930 --> 01:15:29,270
I think the simplest thing to do
is get a zebra crew...

987
01:15:29,305 --> 01:15:31,917
outta some neutral place
like San Antonio, or somethin'.

988
01:15:31,952 --> 01:15:34,981
Now are these zebras
gonna be white or black?

989
01:15:35,016 --> 01:15:38,010
Well, as far as I know,
"zebras are white" and "black."

990
01:15:38,045 --> 01:15:39,335
What are we talkin' about here?

991
01:15:39,370 --> 01:15:40,975
How many black stripes
these zebras got?

992
01:15:41,010 --> 01:15:45,970
I believe a zebra's got about
the same amount ofblack ones
as he does white ones.

993
01:15:46,005 --> 01:15:48,847
How many black stripes
you "think a zebra's got?"

994
01:15:48,882 --> 01:15:51,690
It makes sense to hire a crew
as-is. That's how we always do it.

995
01:15:51,725 --> 01:15:53,415
- Don't make sense to me.
- It makes sense to me.

996
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:56,090
- Not me.
- "Well, not a whole lot"
does make sense to you.

997
01:15:56,125 --> 01:15:58,615
Yeah, there's a lot
that makes sense to me.

998
01:15:58,650 --> 01:16:01,970
So you think having an all-black
officiating crew is gonna
somehow help you win the game?

999
01:16:02,005 --> 01:16:04,770
Watch your mouth.

1000
01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:16,655
Hey, Coach.
How you doin'?
Hey.

1001
01:16:16,690 --> 01:16:18,770
Ben, how you doin'?
All right, Coach. You?

1002
01:16:18,805 --> 01:16:20,610
Oh, pretty good.
Hi, Sharon.

1003
01:16:20,645 --> 01:16:21,690
How you doin'?

1004
01:16:21,770 --> 01:16:25,610
- We're just out gettin'
flowers for the ladies.
- Secretaries Week.

1005
01:16:25,645 --> 01:16:29,335
Oh, is that right? I'll be dogged.
Well, see, I don't have a secretary.

1006
01:16:29,370 --> 01:16:32,890
So I don't have to worry.
You win state, Coach,
we'll get you two secretaries.

1007
01:16:32,925 --> 01:16:35,387
Everything all right?
Well, yeah.

1008
01:16:35,422 --> 01:16:37,695
Everybody's gonna be just fine.

1009
01:16:37,730 --> 01:16:42,650
Everything's all right, as long
as we get out there and get
what we need to get done...

1010
01:16:42,685 --> 01:16:45,490
and, uh, you know,
win state.

1011
01:16:46,690 --> 01:16:48,775
Boy, I sure hope so.
Yeah, me too.

1012
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:52,055
Yeah, I want it bad
as y'all do, believe me.
Yes, sir.

1013
01:16:52,090 --> 01:16:54,530
'Course, you know, Dallas Carter.
That's a... That's a tough team.

1014
01:16:54,565 --> 01:16:57,855
Real tough team.
Yeah? Well.

1015
01:16:57,890 --> 01:17:00,890
We're a pretty tough
team too, Coach.
Yeah, that's true.

1016
01:17:00,925 --> 01:17:04,170
So, uh, beat 'em.

1017
01:17:07,450 --> 01:17:09,450
Or what?

1018
01:17:10,770 --> 01:17:13,015
Or what?

1019
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:16,095
Or...

1020
01:17:16,130 --> 01:17:20,530
You know, that'd be a real
bad deal for you, Gary, so...

1021
01:17:21,730 --> 01:17:25,450
All right? Let's just
get out there and get it done.

1022
01:17:25,485 --> 01:17:27,530
Get that state championship.

1023
01:17:29,330 --> 01:17:31,450
Well, I sure appreciate your support.

1024
01:17:31,485 --> 01:17:33,535
We believe in you.
I'm glad you do.

1025
01:17:33,570 --> 01:17:35,770
We're behind you, Coach.
See you, Sharon.

1026
01:17:36,970 --> 01:17:38,935
Well, "that" was subtle.

1027
01:17:38,970 --> 01:17:41,890
Yup.
Are we gonna move again?

1028
01:17:41,925 --> 01:17:44,490
No, baby.
It's possible.

1029
01:17:44,525 --> 01:17:46,495
No.

1030
01:18:11,210 --> 01:18:14,550
What do you think about Alaska?

1031
01:18:14,585 --> 01:18:17,655
What about Alaska?
Well, you know,

1032
01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:20,770
I bet that they are
not nearly as serious about
their football in Alaska.

1033
01:18:20,805 --> 01:18:23,450
I think that's a real nice idea.
We should go to Alaska.

1034
01:18:23,485 --> 01:18:27,215
"Stay there for a couple years"..."20."

1035
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:29,570
Okay.
Just somethin'
to think about, baby.

1036
01:18:29,605 --> 01:18:33,290
Mm-hmm.
I think it'd be really nice.

1037
01:18:33,410 --> 01:18:36,930
Build us a nice little igloo.

1038
01:18:38,610 --> 01:18:41,370
Baby, these boys are big.

1039
01:18:41,405 --> 01:18:44,130
Yeah, they are.
Sure are.

1040
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:18,295
You get any sleep last night?
Oh, yes, sir. I did. I did.

1041
01:19:18,330 --> 01:19:21,330
Good. We got a six hour ride,
so you can get you some more.
All right, Coach.

1042
01:19:23,810 --> 01:19:25,810
Coach.

1043
01:19:30,210 --> 01:19:32,330
Coach.

1044
01:19:44,650 --> 01:19:48,770
You got room for one more?
Absolutely. Hop on.

1045
01:20:38,210 --> 01:20:40,175
Mojo has come to Houston.

1046
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:42,970
This is the Astrodome, the eighth
wonder of the world, and today...

1047
01:20:43,005 --> 01:20:46,090
it's gonna be Odessa Permian
versus Dallas Carter.

1048
01:20:46,970 --> 01:20:49,255
This is a moment these kids have
been looking for their whole life.

1049
01:20:49,290 --> 01:20:53,850
They started playing as
eight year olds in the Pop Warner
fields of Odessa, or in Dallas.

1050
01:20:53,885 --> 01:20:56,815
They've dreamed of
the state championship
laying in bed late at night,

1051
01:20:56,850 --> 01:21:02,610
dreaming of their chance to bring
home the title, for their town,
for their team, for their school.

1052
01:21:02,645 --> 01:21:05,610
Folks, you better lock the doors,
turn up the radios, strap yourself in.

1053
01:21:05,645 --> 01:21:07,855
We've got east Texas
versus west Texas.

1054
01:21:07,890 --> 01:21:10,375
We've got Texas high school football
at its finest.

1055
01:21:10,410 --> 01:21:15,090
No doubt. This crowd is jacked.!
This is gonna be an all-out war.!

1056
01:22:08,730 --> 01:22:10,890
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen...

1057
01:22:10,925 --> 01:22:13,050
Welcome, Dallas Carter fans.

1058
01:22:13,970 --> 01:22:16,730
Permian will be
the home team in white.
Carter will be the visiting team in red.

1059
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:17,815
"To the 1988"...

1060
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:19,850
Come on, fellas. Let's shake hands.
Have a good ball game.

1061
01:22:19,930 --> 01:22:22,930
- "Texas 5-A"...
- I'm gonna ring your bell
all day long, Mexican.

1062
01:22:22,965 --> 01:22:24,010
Football championship.

1063
01:22:24,130 --> 01:22:25,410
Let's not fumble.
You too, Goldilocks.

1064
01:22:25,650 --> 01:22:27,970
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

1065
01:22:28,005 --> 01:22:29,970
Let's play football!

1066
01:22:30,010 --> 01:22:32,090
All right, Dallas
kicking off to Permian.

1067
01:22:33,970 --> 01:22:35,935
We're underway
in the state championship.

1068
01:22:35,970 --> 01:22:40,335
Harold Jones kickoff
carries eight yards.
Comer should down it there.

1069
01:22:40,370 --> 01:22:43,050
Wait.! He's gonna bring it out.!
No.! What are you doing?

1070
01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:46,935
Howser makes the tackle
on the three-yard line.

1071
01:22:46,970 --> 01:22:50,695
And now Chavez
is very slow to get up as
he was just blasted to the turf.

1072
01:22:50,730 --> 01:22:53,850
- Mike I want you to be patient
in there, all right? Keep your cool.
- Yes, sir.

1073
01:22:53,885 --> 01:22:55,295
Be a leader. Okay?
Yes, sir.

1074
01:22:55,330 --> 01:22:57,775
The run's two-seven-seven dolphin.
Let's go!

1075
01:22:57,810 --> 01:23:00,575
Saturday is finally here.
The Texas Bowl is underway.!

1076
01:23:00,610 --> 01:23:04,890
Winchell now first and ten
for Permian inside their five-yard line.

1077
01:23:04,925 --> 01:23:08,570
Winchell, under center will back up.
Here comes Stuber.!

1078
01:23:11,290 --> 01:23:14,775
Dad gum it!
Dad gum it!

1079
01:23:14,810 --> 01:23:19,490
Andjust like that, Stuber
has given Carter a 2-nothing lead.

1080
01:23:19,525 --> 01:23:20,690
Which game are we in?

1081
01:23:21,690 --> 01:23:25,815
And Whitaker
will find Grande and pass
as Chavez is leveled.

1082
01:23:25,850 --> 01:23:30,270
And Grande will take this one
to the half from more than
50 yards away in play.

1083
01:23:30,305 --> 01:23:34,690
There's not a Panther
within ten yards ofhim. That's
a Carter Cowboy touchdown.

1084
01:23:36,450 --> 01:23:39,455
Carter will go for two.
They will not kick.

1085
01:23:39,490 --> 01:23:44,290
No surprise. This team has not kicked
an extra point or a field goal all year.

1086
01:23:44,325 --> 01:23:49,090
Whitaker now will make his play. Going
left will get the two-point conversion.

1087
01:23:49,125 --> 01:23:51,330
Cowboys, ten.
Permian, nothing.

1088
01:23:52,890 --> 01:23:55,090
What's it like out there, Ivory?
They're big.

1089
01:23:56,730 --> 01:23:59,495
They're fast.

1090
01:23:59,530 --> 01:24:01,170
Fun ride, huh, big boy?

1091
01:24:01,205 --> 01:24:03,135
They're dirty.

1092
01:24:03,170 --> 01:24:06,410
Ball's gone. Ball's gone!
He's holding me, Ref!

1093
01:24:06,445 --> 01:24:09,650
- Plus, they fast.
- Yeah, you said that already.

1094
01:24:09,685 --> 01:24:11,530
Hut!

1095
01:24:13,410 --> 01:24:15,375
Do not fumble against a team...

1096
01:24:15,410 --> 01:24:18,050
Two runs to deep turn!
Keep your heads together!

1097
01:24:18,085 --> 01:24:20,050
Help me out!
45-2 split!

1098
01:24:20,130 --> 01:24:24,490
It's gonna be Whitaker to Cane
from 26 yards away.

1099
01:24:24,525 --> 01:24:26,770
He levels Chavez.!

1100
01:24:27,970 --> 01:24:30,570
Oh, and another
Carter Cowboy touchdown.

1101
01:24:34,285 --> 01:24:36,735
Go, Cowboys.!

1102
01:24:36,770 --> 01:24:39,295
Yeah!
Whoo!

1103
01:24:39,330 --> 01:24:42,250
All day long, baby.
All day long.

1104
01:24:42,285 --> 01:24:43,935
That's it.
Oh, yeah.

1105
01:24:43,970 --> 01:24:45,935
You're gonna have to wake up.
You understand me?
Yes, sir.

1106
01:24:45,970 --> 01:24:49,170
Are you gonna let
the offense do everything,
or are you gonna help us out some?

1107
01:24:49,205 --> 01:24:51,135
- I'm gonna help us.
- You gonna help us out some? Okay.

1108
01:24:51,170 --> 01:24:55,610
You gonna have to keep them out of
the end zone 'cause if they score more
than we do, we lose the game, 'kay?

1109
01:24:55,645 --> 01:24:57,490
Right.
All right? So "wake up.!"

1110
01:24:58,490 --> 01:25:01,655
It's been all Carter here
in the first quarter.

1111
01:25:01,690 --> 01:25:05,010
Carter over 161 yards already,
and Panthers minus 21.

1112
01:25:05,045 --> 01:25:07,650
"Winchell is trying"...

1113
01:25:09,490 --> 01:25:12,090
Comer stopped at the line again.!

1114
01:25:14,490 --> 01:25:16,790
Great grandma's drawers!
I can't believe that!

1115
01:25:16,825 --> 01:25:19,055
Winchell's downed again.!

1116
01:25:19,090 --> 01:25:22,130
Right now I don't know if we need to
worry so much about the scores,

1117
01:25:22,165 --> 01:25:25,130
just whether or not we'll be able
to take all these boys home.

1118
01:25:25,165 --> 01:25:29,330
"Permian's offensive line is being"...

1119
01:25:35,410 --> 01:25:37,890
What in the world are you doing?
Did you see that?

1120
01:25:37,925 --> 01:25:39,570
Did you see that?
Back up, Coach.

1121
01:25:39,605 --> 01:25:40,810
He almost killed him!

1122
01:25:40,890 --> 01:25:44,290
Clay, this game is quickly
spiraling out of control.

1123
01:25:44,325 --> 01:25:45,810
At some point you worry
about the safety of the kids.

1124
01:25:48,410 --> 01:25:52,170
Tell you what. The Panthers came
into this ball game really fired up.

1125
01:25:52,205 --> 01:25:54,775
Right now they've got the wind
just knocked out of'em.

1126
01:25:54,810 --> 01:25:56,650
You've got to get your head in the game.
Are you in the game?

1127
01:25:56,685 --> 01:25:58,730
- Yes, sir.
- You have to wake up out there!

1128
01:25:58,765 --> 01:26:00,375
Yes, sir!

1129
01:26:00,410 --> 01:26:03,130
Five minutes left to play in
a half that's been all Carter.

1130
01:26:03,165 --> 01:26:05,810
They lead 18-nothing.
Third and one on the Permian 40.

1131
01:26:05,845 --> 01:26:06,850
Come on, Preacher!

1132
01:26:06,930 --> 01:26:10,610
Whitaker with a pro set in shotgun.
Looking once again to throw the ball.

1133
01:26:10,645 --> 01:26:11,730
Gotta come off it.
Let's go!

1134
01:26:11,890 --> 01:26:13,975
McCleery's comin'on the zone blitz.

1135
01:26:14,010 --> 01:26:17,330
Robert Whitaker will look to throw.
Looking right. Ball is in the air.

1136
01:26:17,365 --> 01:26:19,690
"And it's picked offby"...

1137
01:26:20,690 --> 01:26:23,370
And I'm pretty sure
the Preacher Man is
headed for the promised land.

1138
01:26:23,405 --> 01:26:25,970
He may take this one all the way.!

1139
01:26:26,005 --> 01:26:27,250
"He clears"...
Yeah!

1140
01:26:27,330 --> 01:26:31,530
Finally a spark oflife
in the form of Ivory Christian.!

1141
01:26:31,565 --> 01:26:34,347
Whitaker has taken him down.!

1142
01:26:34,382 --> 01:26:37,015
Inside the Mojo's 5.!

1143
01:26:37,050 --> 01:26:39,695
We've got plenty of time
to get in this game.

1144
01:26:39,730 --> 01:26:42,815
Y'all need to wake up out there
and play football, okay?

1145
01:26:42,850 --> 01:26:47,010
You need to find each other.
'Cause you need each other
right now, so find each other.

1146
01:26:49,650 --> 01:26:53,690
Go field goal. Let's get on the board.
Elephant-37. Count it on one. Ready.
Break!

1147
01:26:53,725 --> 01:26:55,855
Jump on the ball!

1148
01:26:55,890 --> 01:26:59,450
Left to Winchell,
drops back, rolls right.

1149
01:26:59,485 --> 01:27:01,335
He's gonna run it inside the five.!

1150
01:27:01,370 --> 01:27:03,690
Winchell throws this play
towards the end zone.

1151
01:27:03,725 --> 01:27:06,335
Anthony has him,
but Mike Winchell...

1152
01:27:06,370 --> 01:27:10,935
will stretch himself into the end zone
for the Mojo touchdown.!

1153
01:27:10,970 --> 01:27:15,050
- Winchell strives for the goal line.
Holds the ball out over the plane.
- Yes!

1154
01:27:15,085 --> 01:27:16,930
He didn't break the plane!
Coach, we've got him...

1155
01:27:20,250 --> 01:27:23,495
Hey, Ref! Did you see that?

1156
01:27:23,530 --> 01:27:25,890
What? There's no way he got in.
He got in.

1157
01:27:25,925 --> 01:27:27,775
How you gonna...
Coach James!

1158
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:30,335
Winchell's without a helmet.!
Kicked in his face.!

1159
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:34,690
There's not a flag
anywhere on the field!
How can you miss that, Ref?

1160
01:27:34,725 --> 01:27:38,887
Time has run out in the first half.

1161
01:27:38,922 --> 01:27:43,050
Coach Gary Gaines and his Mojo Cats
trail Carter by 26-7.

1162
01:27:43,370 --> 01:27:45,970
- What in the hell happened on that...
- That's right, Green. You understand that?

1163
01:27:46,005 --> 01:27:47,855
Forty yards? Hell no!

1164
01:27:47,890 --> 01:27:50,370
"You guys are" not "doin'"
any pass blockin;

1165
01:27:50,405 --> 01:27:53,175
You're just steppin' aside
and lettin' 'em walk in...

1166
01:27:53,210 --> 01:27:56,855
Pop, pop, pop!
That's what I want!
All of you around that ball!

1167
01:27:56,890 --> 01:27:59,210
To go for two and get it every
single time? That is ridiculous.

1168
01:27:59,245 --> 01:28:01,530
Do you realize they have not
even kicked a field goal yet?
Just relax.

1169
01:28:01,565 --> 01:28:03,295
We not tryin' to coach y'all now.

1170
01:28:03,330 --> 01:28:06,095
Coach done gave y'all
all these adjustments, okay?

1171
01:28:06,130 --> 01:28:08,890
If you do everything the coach
told you to do...
Two-point conversions,

1172
01:28:08,925 --> 01:28:10,895
I want those gone.
Here is what we're gonna do.

1173
01:28:10,930 --> 01:28:13,535
We're gonna use our speed.
"We're gonna run Texas power"...

1174
01:28:13,570 --> 01:28:16,975
What's wrong with y'all?
Y'all are playin' like some little girls!

1175
01:28:17,010 --> 01:28:19,570
Y'all act like you never
played football before!
These guys are nothin'!

1176
01:28:19,605 --> 01:28:21,495
- You hear me?
- They bleed just like we do.

1177
01:28:21,530 --> 01:28:23,430
Yes, sir!
- And sweat just like we do.

1178
01:28:23,465 --> 01:28:25,295
- Do you hear me?
- They went through two-a-days.

1179
01:28:25,330 --> 01:28:28,295
- We went through two-a-days
in 110 degree heat!
- Yes, sir!

1180
01:28:28,330 --> 01:28:31,450
I want you to hit everything
that move! If the ref gets
in your way, you hit him!

1181
01:28:31,485 --> 01:28:34,107
- Okay, then. Let's play!
- They're cheatin' us too!

1182
01:28:34,142 --> 01:28:36,996
They're against us too.
This is our team. This is us!

1183
01:28:37,031 --> 01:28:39,815
Let's go right now!
Let's get it off now and let's go!

1184
01:28:39,850 --> 01:28:44,130
Permian is gonna have to step up here
and establish some offensive confidence.

1185
01:28:54,650 --> 01:28:56,650
Let's go.

1186
01:29:14,450 --> 01:29:18,930
Well, it's real simple.
You got two more quarters
and that's it.

1187
01:29:21,490 --> 01:29:24,290
Now most of you have been
playing this game for ten years.

1188
01:29:25,970 --> 01:29:30,770
You got two more quarters and
after that most of you will never play
this game again as long as you live.

1189
01:29:32,090 --> 01:29:34,255
You all have known me
for a while...

1190
01:29:34,290 --> 01:29:37,570
and for a long time now, you've been
hearing me talk about being perfect.

1191
01:29:37,605 --> 01:29:39,890
Well, I want you
to understand somethin'.

1192
01:29:40,890 --> 01:29:44,130
To me, being perfect...

1193
01:29:44,930 --> 01:29:47,770
is not about that
scoreboard out there.

1194
01:29:48,930 --> 01:29:50,930
It's not about winning.

1195
01:29:52,410 --> 01:29:57,210
It's about you and your
relationship to yourself and
your family and your friends.

1196
01:29:58,410 --> 01:30:00,410
Bein'perfect...

1197
01:30:01,570 --> 01:30:04,610
is about being able to look
your friends in the eye...

1198
01:30:05,770 --> 01:30:09,890
and "know" that you
didn't let them down.

1199
01:30:09,925 --> 01:30:13,215
Because you told 'em the truth.

1200
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:16,370
And that truth is, is that you did
everything that you could.

1201
01:30:16,405 --> 01:30:19,810
There wasn't one more thing
that you could've done.

1202
01:30:19,845 --> 01:30:22,447
Can you live in that moment...

1203
01:30:22,482 --> 01:30:25,050
as best you can with clear eyes...

1204
01:30:26,330 --> 01:30:28,330
and love in your heart?

1205
01:30:30,690 --> 01:30:33,695
With joy in your heart?

1206
01:30:33,730 --> 01:30:36,210
If you can do that, gentlemen,

1207
01:30:38,330 --> 01:30:41,210
then you're perfect.

1208
01:30:43,410 --> 01:30:45,610
I want you to take a moment...

1209
01:30:46,690 --> 01:30:49,050
and I want you to look
each other in the eyes.

1210
01:30:54,650 --> 01:30:58,295
I want you to put each other
in your hearts forever.

1211
01:30:58,330 --> 01:31:01,530
Because forever's about to happen
here in just a few minutes.

1212
01:31:04,730 --> 01:31:07,210
I want you to close your eyes...

1213
01:31:11,730 --> 01:31:14,090
and I want you to think
about Boobie Miles,

1214
01:31:15,090 --> 01:31:17,210
who is your brother.

1215
01:31:20,090 --> 01:31:24,290
And he would die to be out there
on that field with you tonight.

1216
01:31:27,050 --> 01:31:29,450
And I want you to put that
in your hearts.

1217
01:31:32,250 --> 01:31:34,770
Boys, my heart is full.

1218
01:31:38,170 --> 01:31:40,250
My heart's full.

1219
01:31:42,770 --> 01:31:44,850
Ivory.

1220
01:31:46,930 --> 01:31:49,770
Our Father...
Who art in heaven,

1221
01:31:49,805 --> 01:31:51,135
hallowed be thy name.

1222
01:31:51,170 --> 01:31:53,690
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done...

1223
01:31:53,725 --> 01:31:55,570
On earth as it is in heaven.

1224
01:31:55,610 --> 01:31:57,810
Give us this day our daily bread...

1225
01:31:57,845 --> 01:31:59,775
and forgive us our trespasses.

1226
01:31:59,810 --> 01:32:02,415
As we forgive those
who trespass against us.

1227
01:32:02,450 --> 01:32:05,615
Lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil.

1228
01:32:05,650 --> 01:32:09,450
- For thine is the kingdom...
- The power and the glory forever.

1229
01:32:09,485 --> 01:32:11,450
Amen!

1230
01:32:22,610 --> 01:32:23,690
That's it, baby!

1231
01:32:28,090 --> 01:32:29,890
Hut.!

1232
01:32:33,370 --> 01:32:36,090
- Let go offense!
- Lead and roll.
- Spread right Eagle.

1233
01:32:40,010 --> 01:32:42,090
- Are you hungry?
- Thank you.

1234
01:32:43,370 --> 01:32:45,815
They're killin' us with their size.

1235
01:32:45,850 --> 01:32:49,410
They're playing some
hard-hitting football.!

1236
01:32:53,850 --> 01:32:55,210
- Whoo!
- Get off the ball!

1237
01:32:56,530 --> 01:32:58,850
Drive hard!

1238
01:33:00,090 --> 01:33:02,930
- Sit!
- We will not be able to live,
do you realize that?

1239
01:33:02,965 --> 01:33:04,610
Let the boy play.
Get your guys back.

1240
01:33:04,645 --> 01:33:05,730
Golly bum!

1241
01:33:05,890 --> 01:33:09,690
"Z" up 543. Get to the first landmark
or I'm gonna hit you as soon as
you get there.

1242
01:33:09,725 --> 01:33:11,690
- On one, ready.
- Break!

1243
01:33:14,490 --> 01:33:16,650
- Get hell into the snap!
- Show me somethin'!

1244
01:33:20,730 --> 01:33:23,370
- Whoo!
- Did you see that?
That's the way to play ball.

1245
01:33:23,405 --> 01:33:25,495
You know that was a bad call!

1246
01:33:25,530 --> 01:33:28,495
Now if he backs up
on the next series, it'll be over.

1247
01:33:28,530 --> 01:33:30,975
He can't drop back
fast enough, all right?
Yeah, it's good.

1248
01:33:31,010 --> 01:33:34,530
After the blowout of the first half,

1249
01:33:34,565 --> 01:33:36,730
we've seen a showcase of defense
here in the third quarter.

1250
01:33:36,765 --> 01:33:40,810
The score closing
with Carter on top, 26-14.

1251
01:33:42,410 --> 01:33:45,135
10:25 remains
in the fourth quarter.

1252
01:33:45,170 --> 01:33:50,490
It's third and ten for Carter as Whitaker
is pinned and hit Drake for six.

1253
01:33:50,525 --> 01:33:53,247
Tackled by Thomas.
It's gonna be fourth down.

1254
01:33:53,282 --> 01:33:55,935
You know Carter's
going for it on fourth.

1255
01:33:55,970 --> 01:33:59,410
Unbelievable.! James is not
even gonna consider a punt.!

1256
01:33:59,445 --> 01:34:02,815
So now Whitaker on fourth down
as Carter will go for it.

1257
01:34:02,850 --> 01:34:06,370
He's gonna look for Graf.
Graf's the main receiver, and
this one bounces off the turf.

1258
01:34:06,405 --> 01:34:07,970
Oh, incomplete.

1259
01:34:08,050 --> 01:34:10,535
No way.
Got that touchdown.

1260
01:34:10,570 --> 01:34:12,590
Look, did you see it?
I'm gonna talk to him.

1261
01:34:12,625 --> 01:34:14,610
Well, I wanna talk to
whoever "did" see it!

1262
01:34:14,645 --> 01:34:16,255
I wanna talk to whoever
"did" see it!

1263
01:34:16,290 --> 01:34:19,150
This is big, man.
Anybody get a better look? Gary?

1264
01:34:19,185 --> 01:34:22,010
- Did you turn? Jason?
- I turned and looked,
but I was lost.

1265
01:34:22,045 --> 01:34:24,255
- That ain't no catch.
- I couldn't see it.

1266
01:34:24,290 --> 01:34:27,730
- Are you sure he
caught that football?
- His was a catch, Ref.

1267
01:34:27,765 --> 01:34:31,170
- Lee, Mack, set 'em up.
We got first down.

1268
01:34:31,205 --> 01:34:33,570
What are you talkin' about?

1269
01:34:33,605 --> 01:34:35,615
That was a bad call!

1270
01:34:35,650 --> 01:34:38,290
This man has it.
This man had the catch.

1271
01:34:39,850 --> 01:34:43,490
- There's no way.
The ball came off the turf.
- That is bullshit!

1272
01:34:44,250 --> 01:34:46,215
Here's the pass.
Whitaker has found Graf.

1273
01:34:46,250 --> 01:34:51,255
Graf makes a one-handed
phenomenal catch
for another Carter T.D.

1274
01:34:51,290 --> 01:34:55,130
Chavez in frustration
levels him in the end zone.
Personal foul on the defense.

1275
01:34:55,165 --> 01:34:58,890
And that's gonna cost Permian
15 on the kickoff.

1276
01:34:59,490 --> 01:35:01,990
Called on the Carter
two-point conversion.
They now lead 34-14.

1277
01:35:02,025 --> 01:35:04,490
These Panthers
are gettin'beat physically.

1278
01:35:04,525 --> 01:35:06,655
They're gettin'beat mentally.
They're really down.

1279
01:35:06,690 --> 01:35:09,810
We've seen games like this before,
but Permian's always
been on the other end.

1280
01:35:09,845 --> 01:35:12,587
All right? We're lookin'
for the next play.

1281
01:35:12,622 --> 01:35:15,330
Comer got across the five.

1282
01:35:15,365 --> 01:35:18,295
Comer, to the 30, to the 35.

1283
01:35:18,330 --> 01:35:20,410
Comer could go all the way, folks.

1284
01:35:20,445 --> 01:35:23,895
Comer, 25, 20, 15,

1285
01:35:23,930 --> 01:35:28,575
10, 5.!
That's a Mojo touchdown.!

1286
01:35:28,610 --> 01:35:34,090
Chris Comer has brought
Permian back one more time.!

1287
01:35:34,125 --> 01:35:37,255
We're in this ball game now.
We're in this ball game.

1288
01:35:37,290 --> 01:35:42,255
- "5:27 to play."
Carter still leads 34-21.
- Come on, Chavo!

1289
01:35:42,290 --> 01:35:46,250
They will pitch it to Grande.
Ripped away by Chavez.!

1290
01:35:50,370 --> 01:35:53,095
Let's go!

1291
01:35:53,130 --> 01:35:55,535
Yeah! Come on!

1292
01:35:55,570 --> 01:35:58,170
Now strong right,
81 Trojan horse.

1293
01:36:01,930 --> 01:36:04,410
All right. Here we go, fellas.
Let's shock these punks.

1294
01:36:04,445 --> 01:36:06,415
Strong right, 81 Trojan horse.

1295
01:36:06,450 --> 01:36:09,850
Me and you, baby. We got it.
Throw it deep. On one, ready.

1296
01:36:11,530 --> 01:36:13,855
Mike Winchell to
Don Billingsley will go right.

1297
01:36:13,890 --> 01:36:18,370
They're on the run, but stop, wait.
Instead he's looking for a receiver.

1298
01:36:18,405 --> 01:36:20,250
Winchell's open.!

1299
01:36:22,770 --> 01:36:26,850
Winchell's open in the end zone.
"Winchell make a" tremendous "catch.!"

1300
01:36:26,885 --> 01:36:32,370
Winchell, with a touchdown reception,
scores the Mojo touchdown.!

1301
01:36:32,405 --> 01:36:35,370
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

1302
01:36:37,570 --> 01:36:38,815
One more, one more.

1303
01:36:38,850 --> 01:36:42,095
But is it too little, too late
for Coach Gary Gaines?

1304
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:46,810
Mojo defense is really gonna have to
step it up if they have a prayer
of winning the state championship.

1305
01:36:46,845 --> 01:36:50,210
Grande, across midfield.
Dropped at the 40.

1306
01:36:50,245 --> 01:36:51,490
- First down!
- Let's go, baby!

1307
01:36:51,570 --> 01:36:54,610
The clock now has to be
a concern for Coach Gary Gaines
and the Permian staff.

1308
01:36:54,645 --> 01:36:57,010
We need to stop right now.

1309
01:36:57,810 --> 01:37:01,335
First and ten now for Carter
from the Permian 30.

1310
01:37:01,370 --> 01:37:06,170
Less than two minutes to play.
One more Carter first down,
folks, and that will be it.

1311
01:37:07,170 --> 01:37:10,695
- "Grande hit.!"
- Yeah, baby!

1312
01:37:10,730 --> 01:37:13,450
They do know how to tackle.
All right!

1313
01:37:13,485 --> 01:37:15,695
What's my edge?
What's my edge?

1314
01:37:15,730 --> 01:37:19,930
Second down and long.
Promptly falls back.

1315
01:37:19,965 --> 01:37:22,810
Just keep rollin' it, baby.

1316
01:37:22,845 --> 01:37:24,655
Come on!

1317
01:37:24,690 --> 01:37:27,910
The clock continues to roll.
This will set up third down.

1318
01:37:27,945 --> 01:37:31,130
Permian desperately needs a stop
to get the ball back.

1319
01:37:31,165 --> 01:37:34,655
Grande right up the gun
over Chavez.!

1320
01:37:34,690 --> 01:37:36,855
Maybejust doing what
he needs for a first down.

1321
01:37:36,890 --> 01:37:40,530
First down here,
and the game's over.

1322
01:37:41,770 --> 01:37:45,110
It didn't make it.
It's short.

1323
01:37:45,145 --> 01:37:48,295
Short.! By inches.!
Okay. Mm-hmm.

1324
01:37:48,330 --> 01:37:50,570
James immediately signals
he's goin'for it.

1325
01:37:50,605 --> 01:37:52,615
James is gonna gamble.

1326
01:37:52,650 --> 01:37:56,810
He can get these four inches
and win the state championship,
right here, right now.

1327
01:37:56,845 --> 01:37:58,930
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna do a Texas stunt.

1328
01:37:58,965 --> 01:38:01,610
Now, Ivory, you and Steen,
I want you to twist.
Yes, sir.

1329
01:38:01,645 --> 01:38:02,930
Steen, you go first.
Yo, Coach.

1330
01:38:03,010 --> 01:38:05,695
Ivory, you come offhis butt
into the 'A"gap.
Yes, sir.

1331
01:38:05,730 --> 01:38:08,690
Lucas, you crash the "A" gap, too.
Let's shut these cocky
sons-of-guns down!

1332
01:38:08,725 --> 01:38:10,490
Now let's go!
Let's shut 'em down.

1333
01:38:10,570 --> 01:38:11,815
Go, Donnie, go!

1334
01:38:11,850 --> 01:38:14,570
Let's go! Let's shut 'em
down right now.
Let's shut 'em down.

1335
01:38:14,605 --> 01:38:17,187
Right here!
Take 'em.

1336
01:38:17,222 --> 01:38:19,796
West Texas football, baby.

1337
01:38:19,831 --> 01:38:22,335
Whitaker comes to the line.

1338
01:38:22,370 --> 01:38:24,810
- Okay, let's go.
- Come on, D.

1339
01:38:24,845 --> 01:38:27,250
Looks across.
Calls the cadence.

1340
01:38:27,285 --> 01:38:28,495
Hut!

1341
01:38:28,530 --> 01:38:31,330
Hands to his running back.
Grande.!

1342
01:38:38,530 --> 01:38:41,210
- Let it go. Let it go. Let it go.
- Damn it, boy!

1343
01:38:41,245 --> 01:38:44,575
Yeah!

1344
01:38:44,610 --> 01:38:47,210
- Mike, I want you to show 'em
who we are.
- Yes, sir.

1345
01:38:47,245 --> 01:38:48,975
Okay? Show 'em who we are.
Execute.!

1346
01:38:49,010 --> 01:38:52,210
As Winchell gathers his
teammates up into a huddle,

1347
01:38:52,245 --> 01:38:54,667
he can see on the big clock down
in the end zone...

1348
01:38:54,702 --> 01:38:57,090
one minute
and 40 seconds to play.
Break!

1349
01:38:57,250 --> 01:39:02,970
One time out left,
and he has 75 yards
of Astrodome turfto go.

1350
01:39:03,005 --> 01:39:05,695
Green, 12, hut, hut, hut!

1351
01:39:05,730 --> 01:39:08,330
Winchell wings it off to Comer.
Comer has it, picks up a block.

1352
01:39:08,365 --> 01:39:09,575
- That a way, Comer!
- On three!

1353
01:39:09,610 --> 01:39:13,690
Off to Billingsley.
Billingsley breaks out a big event.

1354
01:39:13,725 --> 01:39:15,855
We're at a first down.

1355
01:39:15,890 --> 01:39:19,010
- Way to go, son!
- "Stop the clock"
for goin'out ofbounds.

1356
01:39:19,045 --> 01:39:20,530
Okay. Let's go. Let's go.
Let's get wild!

1357
01:39:23,810 --> 01:39:25,690
Come on, Michael!

1358
01:39:25,725 --> 01:39:27,535
- He wasn't ready!
- Let's go! Let's go!

1359
01:39:27,570 --> 01:39:31,490
Winchell adds time as he drops back.
He's looking to the right.

1360
01:39:31,525 --> 01:39:34,010
Payne is wide open
down the right sideline.!

1361
01:39:34,045 --> 01:39:36,290
The pass is in the air.!

1362
01:39:41,050 --> 01:39:45,650
This Tennessee-bound tracer
comes halfway across the field
to knock the ball loose.

1363
01:39:45,685 --> 01:39:47,695
Payne had it.

1364
01:39:47,730 --> 01:39:52,010
- "I'll tell you. Mike Winchell, folks,"
showin'how tough he is.
- Come on, baby, get up!

1365
01:39:52,045 --> 01:39:53,855
Hang in there under
unsurmounting pressure.

1366
01:39:53,890 --> 01:39:56,350
Winchell appears to be okay, folks.
He's one tough dude.

1367
01:39:56,385 --> 01:39:58,810
He's back on his feet.
Let's go, baby!
We need you, Mike!

1368
01:40:00,890 --> 01:40:04,255
- "l" right. 90.
- Mike, you all right?

1369
01:40:04,290 --> 01:40:06,330
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right, man.

1370
01:40:07,730 --> 01:40:11,290
"Under a minute to play"...
"52 seconds"...

1371
01:40:11,325 --> 01:40:14,850
Winchell will scan,
pick it to Comer.
It's a bootleg pass.!

1372
01:40:20,570 --> 01:40:25,130
He's latched onto it.
It's Wyles, down to the Carter 25.!

1373
01:40:25,165 --> 01:40:26,450
Look, I want you to feel it.

1374
01:40:27,410 --> 01:40:28,895
Show me some heart!

1375
01:40:28,930 --> 01:40:30,930
Permian showing
what a tough out they are.

1376
01:40:30,965 --> 01:40:33,650
Come on, Donnie! Go!

1377
01:40:39,450 --> 01:40:42,110
That's a first down!
Whose game, baby?

1378
01:40:42,145 --> 01:40:44,615
Whose game is it?
Come on. There we go.

1379
01:40:44,650 --> 01:40:48,090
Clay, he's hurt.! He's hurt.
He grabs his shoulder.

1380
01:40:51,090 --> 01:40:54,450
Trapper helps him off the field.
Feels like he dislocated his shoulder.

1381
01:40:54,485 --> 01:40:56,535
See ya, fella!
Bye-bye!

1382
01:40:56,570 --> 01:40:58,215
Shake it off.
Get back out there.

1383
01:40:58,250 --> 01:41:00,335
- Strong left 90 "Z" five, ready?
- Break!

1384
01:41:00,370 --> 01:41:04,650
Permian with 35 seconds
to play go to Comer.!

1385
01:41:04,685 --> 01:41:07,010
And Comer over the red zone.

1386
01:41:07,045 --> 01:41:09,175
- Ooh, God.
- Ooh!

1387
01:41:09,210 --> 01:41:12,590
Did you see that?
I'll back up when
I'm through talkin' to you.

1388
01:41:12,625 --> 01:41:15,970
Comer is on Queer Street,
walking towards the Carter sideline.

1389
01:41:18,970 --> 01:41:21,890
Winchell on third down, again,
"will drop the pass"...

1390
01:41:22,890 --> 01:41:27,450
Hard to the turf.
And Permian will now
have to burn their final time-out.

1391
01:41:27,485 --> 01:41:30,415
Third and final time-out.

1392
01:41:30,450 --> 01:41:33,770
You have to pass.
You have no choice but to pass.
All their backs are out.

1393
01:41:33,805 --> 01:41:35,535
- We gotta go to the air.
- You gotta throw the football.

1394
01:41:35,570 --> 01:41:39,330
- They ain't got no runnin' back.
- Trapper! Trapper!
I need a runnin' back!

1395
01:41:39,365 --> 01:41:41,210
All right. Just relax.
We'll pop this back in.

1396
01:41:41,290 --> 01:41:47,210
On the count of three.
"One, two"...
Aah!

1397
01:41:47,245 --> 01:41:49,210
We're good to go.

1398
01:41:53,290 --> 01:41:56,410
You're gonna set a Bronco stunt,
then drive into the full pass
three-man coverage.

1399
01:41:56,445 --> 01:41:57,690
You got that?
Got it.

1400
01:41:57,770 --> 01:42:00,170
So, Clay, if you're Gary Gaines,
what do you do?

1401
01:42:00,205 --> 01:42:02,210
Coach Gaines is
done out of running backs.

1402
01:42:02,245 --> 01:42:04,055
"We've" got "to go to the air."

1403
01:42:04,090 --> 01:42:06,930
A vertical smash
and go to a reverse.
I agree. I agree.

1404
01:42:06,965 --> 01:42:09,770
Coach, we gotta get number one
across the goal line.

1405
01:42:09,805 --> 01:42:11,215
Squeeze it.
I agree.

1406
01:42:11,250 --> 01:42:14,650
Hang on a second,
hang on a second.
Billingsley, can you do it?

1407
01:42:14,685 --> 01:42:17,175
- Yes, sir.
- You sure?

1408
01:42:17,210 --> 01:42:19,175
- Can you hang onto the ball?
- Yes, sir.

1409
01:42:19,210 --> 01:42:21,695
Okay, then.
All right, now here's
what we're gonna do.

1410
01:42:21,730 --> 01:42:26,130
We're gonna do "l" right wiggle,
34 switchblade. Now, let's go, Mike.

1411
01:42:26,165 --> 01:42:29,187
Hey, Billingsley. They gonna
try to steal the ball from you.

1412
01:42:29,222 --> 01:42:32,175
Cover it. Cover the points.
Roll with it. Don't resist it.

1413
01:42:32,210 --> 01:42:36,055
You got it, baby.
No more fumbles.
That's right! That's right!

1414
01:42:36,090 --> 01:42:40,850
Let's go, baby. It's in your hands.
Don't think about that shoulder.
Just keep driving your feet.

1415
01:42:40,885 --> 01:42:43,935
"l"right wiggle,
34 switchblade.

1416
01:42:43,970 --> 01:42:46,615
For the state championship.
I love all y'all, baby.

1417
01:42:46,650 --> 01:42:49,215
I love all of ya.
Let's go on one, ready?
Break.!

1418
01:42:49,250 --> 01:42:52,930
Fifty-five thousand people in
the Houston Astrodome, folks,

1419
01:42:52,965 --> 01:42:56,530
and every seat is empty
because everyone is on their feet.

1420
01:43:02,730 --> 01:43:04,575
His offensive line digs in.

1421
01:43:04,610 --> 01:43:07,890
The Carter defense digs in
to face it.

1422
01:43:10,170 --> 01:43:12,815
Down!
Switch.

1423
01:43:12,850 --> 01:43:16,615
312.! 312.!

1424
01:43:16,650 --> 01:43:18,615
Come on.
Run it right down his throat.

1425
01:43:18,650 --> 01:43:21,970
Hut.!
He hands it off to Don Billingsley.!

1426
01:43:23,890 --> 01:43:27,370
Billingsley is lookin'
like Larry Csonka.!

1427
01:43:29,130 --> 01:43:35,090
- Come on.
- "Billingsley holds it, runs over"
another Dallas Carter Cowboy.

1428
01:43:36,410 --> 01:43:39,210
"Down to the" one-"yard line."

1429
01:43:44,290 --> 01:43:47,890
What guts to call that play.!
Fooled everybody on the field.

1430
01:43:47,925 --> 01:43:51,490
- Holding!
- "Clay, wait a minute. I'm seeing"
a hold call by the official.

1431
01:43:51,525 --> 01:43:54,890
Dad gum it!
Ten-yard penalty. Still fourth down.

1432
01:43:54,925 --> 01:43:57,010
- That's bullshit!
- What?

1433
01:43:58,650 --> 01:44:00,455
Strong right, 20 to Frasier.

1434
01:44:00,490 --> 01:44:04,210
Winchell has to hurry.
The clock will start
as soon as the ball is reset.

1435
01:44:05,850 --> 01:44:07,010
Let's go! Hurry up!

1436
01:44:07,410 --> 01:44:11,610
32! 3! 30!
Set! Hut!

1437
01:44:35,850 --> 01:44:38,730
It's Mike Winchell down to the five.!

1438
01:44:45,010 --> 01:44:46,250

*Into the misty morning sun *

1452
01:51:54,890 --> 01:51:59,830
*Nobody asks you where you are goin'*

1453
01:51:59,865 --> 01:52:04,770
*Nobody knows where you're from *

1454
01:52:08,330 --> 01:52:13,030
* There is a man asking the question *

1455
01:52:13,065 --> 01:52:17,730
*Is this really the end of the world *

1456
01:52:20,730 --> 01:52:26,290
*Seagull you must have known
for a long time *

1457
01:52:26,325 --> 01:52:31,187
* The shape of things to come *

1458
01:52:31,222 --> 01:52:36,050
*Now you fly through the sky *

1459
01:52:36,085 --> 01:52:40,215
*Never asking why *

1460
01:52:40,250 --> 01:52:45,250
*And you fly all around *

1461
01:52:45,285 --> 01:52:51,487

*Seagull, you fly *

1465
01:53:05,885 --> 01:53:09,890
*Seagull, you fly *

1466
01:53:10,690 --> 01:53:15,290
*And you fly away today *

1467
01:53:15,325 --> 01:53:19,890
*And you fly away tomorrow *

1468
01:53:19,925 --> 01:53:24,330
