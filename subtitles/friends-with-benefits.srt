Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

2
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:18,568
Okay. Let's see where we are.

3
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:22,823
We could move this, get
rid of that, kill that.

4
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:27,491
That kind of freaks me out. Don't need her.
We can get rid of that.

5
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,993
That's done.
Okay, we could start with this.

6
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:33,204
I know it's a hard-hitting piece,
but come on, you guys, it's the Internet.

7
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,581
We need traffic, traffic, traffic.
What do you got?

8
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:38,293
- How about this?
- It's perfect.

9
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,791
Now, doesn't she look smart and
knowledgeable about immigration reform?

10
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,801
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. She does, right?

11
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:45,216
I'm fucking with you people.
This isn't a porn site.

12
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,968
What are we, nerds trying
to look at boobies?

13
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,841
Come on, Keep looking.

14
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,343
Shit! Hello?

15
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,929
Hey! Baby, where are you?
Are you still at work?

16
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:55,348
No! Not even close.

17
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,932
Just so you know,
the movie starts in 10 minutes.

18
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,813
- I know! Give me your pants.
- What?

19
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:00,527
- I'll buy you lunch tomorrow. Come on.
- No.

20
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:02,484
I'm your boss. Give me your pants.

21
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:05,032
Please try not to be late.
I really hate missing the beginning.

22
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:06,279
I know. I know.

23
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:09,779
Give me your pants. I'm coming, baby.

24
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:11,780
I'm almost there!

25
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:14,287
- How far away?
- I think I see you!

26
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,003
- Where are you? I'm here.
- So am I.

27
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,921
So many people. What are you wearing?

28
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,466
I'm wearing the only clothes
outside the theater,

29
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,294
because I'm the only person
outside the theater!

30
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,508
I love that outfit.
You look so sexy in that.

31
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,131
You know that I love this movie.

32
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:32,969
If a prostitute and a ruthless businessman
can fall in love,

33
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:34,891
then anyone can.

34
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,143
I know this means a lot to you,
which means it means a lot to me.

35
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,644
Well, apparently it doesn't.

36
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:40,067
I'm looking at you right now.
I can see you!

37
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:41,481
Jamie!

38
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,232
Hey!

39
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,526
- Hey.
- You made it.

40
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,399
- Yeah. Hey.
- Hi.

41
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,985
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's okay. I got us sandwiches.

42
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:52,412
I got you turkey, no cheese,
gluten-free bread.

43
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,494
You sure this was prepared
in a nut-free facility?

44
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,830
Yes, I'm full aware of our allergies.
Y.

45
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:00,838
Hey, I'm here! I'm here. I'm really sorry.

46
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,665
We missed Your Body Is a Wonderland.

47
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,716
Okay. Only one song.
That's not so bad, right?

48
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,210
It was fucking Your Body ls a Wonderland!

49
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:10,181
Well, the good news is,
he has so many good ones.

50
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,975
Here's an idea: next time, instead
of being late, just shit on my face.

51
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,725
'Cause that's kind of the same thing
as missing Your Body ls a Wonderland.

52
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:17,971
Okay, come on. We really gotta go in.

53
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:20,274
Julia Roberts is about to put on
her really tall boots.

54
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,397
We need to talk.

55
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:28,698
I think we should take a break.

56
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:31,118
I just feel like
we should chill for a while, you know?

57
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:32,991
- You're doing this?
- You're breaking up with me?

58
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,413
You said I was your soul mate.

59
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,743
I did? When?

60
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,333
When we were at that bed and breakfast
having sex.

61
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,910
- But, you know, that doesn't...
- That doesn't what?

62
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:43,206
- Count.
- I was tied up at work. I'm sorry.

63
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,625
Maybe you should care
a little bit less about work

64
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,926
and a little more
about the girl that you're dating.

65
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:51,430
'Cause last time I checked,
work doesn't reassure you

66
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:54,015
that liking a finger up your ass
doesn't make you gay.

67
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,935
I never said "go up." Okay?

68
00:02:57,052 --> 00:03:00,431
I just said lightly around...
It's like a little button.

69
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,432
You know what? Not your issue any more.

70
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,683
Is this why you were late?

71
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,269
You were worried
about how to break up with me?

72
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,738
Oh, no, no.
I was trying to decide what to wear.

73
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,069
- So, you went with sneakers and a hoodie.
- Yeah.

74
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:11,905
What, are you gonna
take the SATs after this?

75
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,819
Don't lash out, okay?

76
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,620
- You're better than that.
- I'm really not.

77
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,410
I just think
we're heading in different directions.

78
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,912
Yeah, you to the John Mayer concert
and me not.

79
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,419
Thank you for doing this
before the concert, by the way.

80
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,496
Best breakup ever.

81
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,757
He is the Sheryl Crow of our generation!

82
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,167
Let me just ask you a quick question.

83
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,255
And just know that I am not at all
crushed by this breakup.

84
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,260
So, be honest. Why?

85
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,636
- Wait, is this a trick?
- No.

86
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,600
Just pure anthropological research.

87
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,682
Okay. You want someone
to sweep you off your feet,

88
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,560
but you're more interested
in getting swept off your feet

89
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,856
than the someone who's doing the sweeping.

90
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,150
You seem like you've got
it totally together,

91
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:48,111
but you're actually
really emotionally damaged.

92
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:51,656
Also, you have, like, really big eyes,
and that freaks me out sometimes...

93
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,867
Thank you. That's enough.

94
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,410
It is not you at all.

95
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,614
Of course it's me! You can't say that.
You're breaking up with me!

96
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,492
It's not. It's me.
I don't like you any more.

97
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,994
This is my fault.
You deserve better than me.

98
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,336
You're a great guy.

99
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:08,754
A little too emotionally unavailable,
if you ask me.

100
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,879
I didn't.

101
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,210
I really want to stay friends.

102
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:12,795
- Let's stay friends.
- Sure.

103
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,050
Totally.

104
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:17,178
John Mayer.

105
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,510
John fucking Mayer!

106
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,477
Come here, you.

107
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,147
You're gonna get through this.

108
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:31,322
Why do relationships always start off so
fun and then turn into suck-a-bag-o-dicks?

109
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:35,651
I really have to stop buying into this
bullshit Hollywood cliché of true love.

110
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,537
Shut up, Katherine Heigl! You stupid liar!

111
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,828
I'm just gonna work and fuck.
Like George Clooney.

112
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,665
I'm just gonna
shut myself down emotionally.

113
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,002
Like George Clooney.

114
00:04:58,507 --> 00:04:59,554
Hello.

115
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,180
Seat up, please, sir.

116
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,011
Is that the Hudson River?

117
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,893
No. It's the East River.

118
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:10,027
So we won't be landing on it, then,
like that flight,

119
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:13,272
you know, with that captain
they keep giving medals to?

120
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:15,945
That pilot was a hero.

121
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,535
Asshole.

122
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,864
Plane actually did a lot of the work.

123
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,876
I think I found the perfect guy
to fill that job at GQ.

124
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,208
No, he's landing early. I'm scrambling.

125
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,458
No, he's not sold on the job yet,
but I'll get him there. I always do.

126
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,801
I'm even picking him up in a hybrid.

127
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,588
He's from LA.
I figured he's into all that bullshit.

128
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,969
Hey, sir, what's that
tall building over there?

129
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:41,891
Empire State Building.

130
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,435
No, no, no, no. No. The other one.

131
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:47,352
The really, really tall one
with the antenna on top of it, the windows.

132
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,932
That is Empire State Building.

133
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,606
Oh, yeah. You're right. King Kong.

134
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,773
Hey...

135
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:00,073
Oh, hey! Are you done with this?
All met up?

136
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,745
Great. Welcome to New York,
Ms. Penderghast.

137
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,285
Yeah.

138
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:18,128
Oh, no. Excuse me. Sorry.

139
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,428
Okay.

140
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,803
- Can you hand me my bag?
- Sure. Which one?

141
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,019
- The one with the straps.
- Okay.

142
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,187
There.

143
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,932
Okay.

144
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,105
- Thank you.
- Welcome to New York, sir.

145
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,489
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

146
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,284
That's me.
Which one, the blue or the yellow?

147
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,450
No. The makeshift sign made
out of lipstick, that's me.

148
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,998
- You're Dylan Harper.
- I am.

149
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:48,374
I'm Jamie Rellis.

150
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,207
- You're picking me up from the airport.
- Hi. Yes, I am.

151
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,587
You always pick people up like this?

152
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,540
Yeah, you know,
I like to keep things interesting.

153
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,175
- Welcome to New York.
- Thank you.

154
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,883
You're not exactly what comes to mind
when you think headhunter.

155
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:04,182
Yeah, I prefer "executive recruiter."
Headhunter sounds a little creepy.

156
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,802
You did stalk me for six months.
Kind of creepy.

157
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:08,561
Here, here, here, I'll take it.

158
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:11,523
You're really gonna carry my bag?
You're that girl?

159
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:14,727
No. I'm gonna change your life.
I'm that girl.

160
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,062
My life is already pretty great.

161
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:20,490
Oh, really? 'Cause you wouldn't be here
if your life were already pretty great.

162
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,326
A free trip to New York.
I'd be an idiot to turn that down.

163
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,325
Well, then I guess you must have been
an idiot for the past six months.

164
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,533
Yeah, a lot of people
would say longer than that.

165
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,539
It's a huge opportunity Dylan.

166
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,584
Art director of GQ magazine.
This is the big leagues.

167
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,836
I mean, no offense to your little blog
on the Internet.

168
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,921
Which got six million hits last month.

169
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,921
I could put up a video of me mixing
cake batter with my boobs

170
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,547
and it will get eight million hits.

171
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,676
It's been done. Dunkin-My-Tits-Hynes.com.

172
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,176
Really?

173
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,642
Well, look, there's no question that
you are talented at what you do,

174
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,519
but this is GQ.

175
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,441
New York's so crowded.

176
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,566
Look around. I'm from LA, okay?

177
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:01,782
- I like my open spaces.
- What are you, a gazelle?

178
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,075
Come on,
what's really worrying you about this?

179
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:10,202
I don't know. I don't want to be the guy
who took something legendary

180
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:13,034
and shit the bed with it.
Excuse the expression.

181
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:16,087
Well, then don't be the guy who shit the bed.
Excuse the expression.

182
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:19,254
Be the guy
who made the bed legendary again.

183
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,591
Listen, we'll get some coffee in you
before the interview. You'll be fine.

184
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:28,805
I'm sorry, not coffee.
Some green tea, soy, organic hemp bullshit.

185
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:30,927
Really hot in New York.

186
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,558
Doesn't it get hot in LA?

187
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,514
Yeah, it gets hot in LA,
but it's the humidity.

188
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,396
In LA, if it's 90 degrees,
it feels like 90 degrees. But...

189
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,936
- Right.
- If it's hot in New York,

190
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,900
it's 90 degrees, it's like 100,000 degrees.

191
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,152
This conversation about weather
is really fascinating,

192
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,983
but lucky for me, we are here.

193
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:47,490
So, good luck.

194
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:52,119
Whatever happens, happens.
I told you, I don't really want it.

195
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:55,411
Just do me a favor?
Act like you do so that I look good.

196
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,791
- I can do that.
- Okay. Go get 'em.

197
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,255
This is great, by the way.

198
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,350
Watch it!

199
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,937
- Hey!
- You're still here?

200
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,490
Yeah. Well, it's my job.

201
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:26,654
Nice.

202
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,278
So, tell me, how'd it go?

203
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,239
They bought it.
You're safe for a little while longer.

204
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,620
Well, thank you. I owe you one.

205
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,000
This is from you.

206
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,502
It's your offer.

207
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:44,126
- Wait, I got it?
- They called about five minutes ago.

208
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,297
Congratulations. Offer expires at midnight.

209
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,137
Why didn't you just tell me
instead of texting me?

210
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,642
'Cause it's more dramatic.

211
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,976
Dylan, you are not gonna shit the bed.

212
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,478
I've seen your work. It's amazing.

213
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,358
It's a huge move.

214
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,646
Would you uproot your entire
life for a job? Be honest.

215
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,985
Well, no. For a job, probably not.

216
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:09,986
But for New York? Yeah, I would.

217
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,370
Which is why I'm not gonna
try to sell you on the job,

218
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:13,739
I'm gonna sell you on New York.

219
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,160
It's New York!

220
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,537
I've seen Seinfeld.

221
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,747
Not the bullshit tourist version.

222
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,956
Puppy dog eyes. Nice touch.

223
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,507
Yes! Come on.

224
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,009
Let me buy you a drink.

225
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:30,551
What's wrong?

226
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,594
What are you waiting for?

227
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:33,807
The light to change.

228
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,510
You LA folk are so cute.

229
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:36,936
Come on.

230
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,142
Come on, it's fine.

231
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:39,268
- See?
- Yep.

232
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,439
I'm gonna die.

233
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:44,520
Here we have Brooklyn Bridge,
downtown Manhattan,

234
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,863
and right in front of us, an outdoor bar.

235
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,576
Alcohol. Now we're talking.

236
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,206
You know, I like you.

237
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,082
I'll give you your choice of closes.

238
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,461
- What?
- How I close you on this job.

239
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:04,085
- Okay.
- So we got the flattery close.

240
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,797
Dylan, you are so good at what you do.

241
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,219
The take-it-or-leave-it close.

242
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:12,214
Man, I don't care if you take it.
I get paid regardless.

243
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:13,806
The sympathy close.

244
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:15,349
You see, my kidneys are failing...

245
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,974
Why do women think the only way
to get a man to do what they want

246
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,224
is to manipulate him?

247
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:23,233
History. Personal experience.
Romantic comedies.

248
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,561
Come on, you're here for a reason,
whether you want to admit it or not.

249
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:29,823
Yeah, to explore an option.
Who wouldn't want to know their options?

250
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,403
Someone who's in the perfect situation.

251
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:32,734
Are you in the perfect situation?

252
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,911
Job? Absolutely.

253
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,242
Everything else? None of your business.

254
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:42,543
Shaun!

255
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:43,912
- Jamie!
- Hey!

256
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,664
- Hey, what's up, baby?
- What are you doing here?

257
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:46,839
- Shaun White?
- You look great.

258
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,088
- You been working out?
- Nope. Just been eating a lot.

259
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,467
- Okay.
- Yeah.

260
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:51,677
- You want a drink?
- Yeah!

261
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:52,925
- Let me get you a drink. Yeah?
- Okay.

262
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,431
- Careful! Careful.
- Sorry.

263
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,472
Hey, bro, that was like
a double McTwist 1260.

264
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,476
- Yeah, like the trick.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Dylan.

265
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,144
Jamie, you want to get this guy
out of my face

266
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,608
before I break his fucking skull?

267
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:08,812
Sorry, bro. No disrespect. I'm a huge fan.

268
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:12,316
You don't fucking know me, man!
Don't talk to me like you know me!

269
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,114
What, you think I'm all chill
'cause I snowboard and shit?

270
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,779
One more word,
I'll fuck you up like dynamite!

271
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:19,660
Dynamite?

272
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,621
I'm just playing, bro.

273
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,627
Any friend of Jamie's is cool with me.

274
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:27,130
- It's all good, man.
- All good.

275
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,796
I'm whispering in the ear of a dead man.

276
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,592
I'll see you later.

277
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:32,760
- Good to see you.
- Bye, honey.

278
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,849
Shaun White seems really great. Nice dude.

279
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,806
- How do you know him again?
- I took his virginity.

280
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,391
So you guys have known
each other for a while?

281
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:44,973
No, it was like eight months ago.

282
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:46,854
Wow.

283
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:49,189
So does the carpet match the drapes?

284
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:52,022
It's hardwood floors,
if you know what I mean.

285
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,274
My God! Terrible visual.

286
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,985
Totally kidding, by the way.
Just an old friend of mine.

287
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,159
You guys use the same leave-in conditioner.

288
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,456
His hair had nice body.

289
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,455
Can I get two gyro number sixes,
extra sauce?

290
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,038
- What are you looking for?
- The cops.

291
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,706
- Come on.
- The cops?

292
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,003
Yep...

293
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,001
Come on!

294
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,843
- Where are you taking me?
- You'll see.

295
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,821
Well, here's your open space.

296
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,365
Run, gazelle. Run!

297
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:43,198
- Wow. This is unbelievable.
- I know.

298
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,703
Okay, this was not on Seinfeld.

299
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,881
Come on,
what's your dad think about all this?

300
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,419
About what?

301
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,669
Well, he must have an opinion.

302
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,847
He used to write for the LA Times
for 23 years.

303
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,341
Somebody did their homework.

304
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:05,679
I have this thing at work.
It's called Google.

305
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,935
Come on, what's he think about the job?

306
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,190
Actually, I didn't ask him.

307
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,230
Well, then you must know what he'd say.

308
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:21,362
He'd tell me to go with my gut and that
he'd be proud of me no matter what I did.

309
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:24,914
Sounds like a really great man.

310
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,080
Yeah, he is.

311
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,878
Hey, do you want to
see something really cool?

312
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,464
I always want to see something really cool.
What...

313
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:34,962
Come on.

314
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,589
Okay.

315
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,261
Only place in the city
you can actually see the stars.

316
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,433
- Wow.
- Yeah.

317
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,769
- It's pretty awesome.
- I know.

318
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,147
I like to come up here to think.

319
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:52,107
Just when it gets a little too much
for me down there, it's like...

320
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,485
It's like my New York version
of a mountaintop.

321
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,155
Best part, no cell reception.

322
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,819
You take all your recruits up here?

323
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,282
Actually, never really
taken anyone up here.

324
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,459
- Really?
- Yeah.

325
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:11,081
Thanks.

326
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,413
If you tell anyone about this,
I will rip your ears off

327
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,248
and staple them to your neck.

328
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,176
Everyone in this city seems really violent.

329
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,801
Come on, let's go. One last stop.

330
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:25,509
- We're just getting comfortable.
- I know you are. Come on, buddy.

331
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,977
It's New York. Now hustle. Come on.

332
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,730
- Come on, come on.
- You're showing me Times Square.

333
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:33,183
- This is not touristy at all!
- Would you shush? Come on.

334
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,605
Do we have to power-walk
everywhere we go?

335
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:36,982
Yes.

336
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:40,900
So everybody just kind of walks
wherever they want, then.

337
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,030
How 'bout right here?

338
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,702
- What do you mean?
- We're here.

339
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:52,168
Oh, my God, it's 1988.

340
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,499
All right, smartass, give it five seconds.

341
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,731
- What is this?
- It's a flash mob.

342
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,318
- Like on Oprah!
- Exactly.

343
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,031
Should we get out of the way?

344
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,246
No, no. Enjoy it. Take it all in.

345
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,246
- It's pretty damn cool.
- Right?

346
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:38,377
It's kind of rad.

347
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,376
Do these people get paid for this?

348
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,259
No. No. They kind of just do it for fun.

349
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,178
It's nice to feel
like you're a part of something.

350
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,225
New York can be a little
bit lonely at times.

351
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,012
And you're trying to sell me on it.

352
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:55,390
Every place can be a bit lonely sometimes.

353
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:01,730
- Be careful!
- Oh, my God.

354
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,572
- Come down.
- Okay.

355
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,408
- Shit. Get back down.
- Okay.

356
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,882
- I'm in.
- What?

357
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,381
- You sold me.
- Really?

358
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,137
- I'll take the job.
- Oh, my God!

359
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:34,809
- What, are you surprised?
- No! No. Oh, you are gonna crush it!

360
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,603
Amazing.

361
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:41,277
- You can all go home now! Thank you!
- Very funny.

362
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,441
Come on.

363
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,277
Congratulations, sell-out!

364
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,775
Thank you, thank you.

365
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,160
All I'm saying is,
it wasn't so much the pilot's skill

366
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:52,247
that landed that plane on the river
as much as the mechanics of the aircraft.

367
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,744
Are you saying
that Captain Sully wasn't a hero?

368
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,121
No, no.

369
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:57,956
There were just other factors.

370
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,962
Are you not an American?

371
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,306
Hey, fuckface, you want to get your shit
out of my car or what?

372
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,932
I... Yeah.

373
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,149
Welcome to New York. Go and fuck a dick.

374
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,791
Fuck.

375
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:49,470
So, all I ask is that you give me
a little bit of time to gain your trust.

376
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:54,176
I know that I'm new at this, but what I lack
in experience I make up for in cliches.

377
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:55,844
So, my door is always open.

378
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:01,353
But seriously, my door is always open.

379
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:07,238
My first order of business, lighter doors.

380
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,700
- Okay. Thanks, guys.
- Welcome, Dylan.

381
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,238
Hey, man. Tommy Bollinger, sports editor.

382
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,036
Tommy, I've read your articles.
Love your writing.

383
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:18,791
Just trying to keep it realsies.

384
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:22,086
Listen, I'd love to take you out one night
and troll for cock.

385
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,589
- What?
- You got some pretty boys out there in LA,

386
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:28,380
but the quality in this town is ridiculous.

387
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,552
We can tear this shit up.

388
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,217
I'm not gay, Tommy.

389
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,010
Really? I just assumed,
art director and, you know...

390
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,428
Hey. No skin, more pipe for me.

391
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:41,271
By the way,
doing a piece on racism in hockey.

392
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,517
Love to get your concepts on the font.

393
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:47,445
I'm thinking Helvetica
but I could be persuaded to Courier New.

394
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,781
But what the fuck do I know?
I'm just the sports editor.

395
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,909
- You sure you're not gay?
- Yep.

396
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:55,236
- I'm sure.
- Okay.

397
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,034
All right.

398
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,034
- Hey.
- Hey.

399
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:03,711
I'd knock, but you don't have a door.

400
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,163
- I don't.
- No.

401
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,418
Hey, check this out.

402
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,924
Dunkin-My- Tits-Hynes. Com.

403
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,261
- Yeah, it really does exist.
- I told you, but not that. This.

404
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:15,423
Awesome.

405
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,266
But it'd be even more awesome
if this happened.

406
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,265
Wait for it.

407
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:22,184
Nice!

408
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:24,391
I got in touch with a guy
who puts flash mobs together.

409
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,817
We're thinking about using them
for guerrilla advertising.

410
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,271
Taking something so pure
and commercializing it?

411
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,064
Knew I found the right guy.

412
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,275
- Here I am.
- Okay. Here's your contract.

413
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,946
Sign it and I will be out of here.

414
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:36,948
Okay.

415
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:39,955
A whole year?

416
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,914
Why do I get the feeling this is the first
real commitment you've ever made?

417
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,416
It's not. T-Mobile, two years.

418
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,667
And, fuck, do I regret that one.

419
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,299
Do me a favor. Don't quit or get
fired before the year's up,

420
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,838
because otherwise I don't get my bonus.

421
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,336
Wait, I can leave whenever I want?

422
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,138
- What's the point of this contract?
- Just sign the damn thing.

423
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:57,469
Okay.

424
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,140
Nice doing business with you, Dylan Harper.

425
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,478
Hey, I was thinking of getting some lunch.
Do you know a place?

426
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:09,818
Are you asking me out?

427
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,446
Whoa, I'm not asking you out.

428
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,693
I'm asking you to show me a restaurant.

429
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,441
I mean, I'm the only friend you have
in New York.

430
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,777
- You don't wanna complicate that.
- I know. I'm not asking you out.

431
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,862
I mean, sure, we'd have fun, roll around,

432
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,160
- get into some erotic humiliation fantasy.
- Erotic?

433
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,626
But it'd all blow up in our faces, end badly,
and we'd never speak to each other again.

434
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,328
I'm not fucking asking you out!
I swear to God!

435
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,706
Okay. You don't like me like that.

436
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,999
You don't have to be so mean about it.

437
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:34,965
I'm sorry. I didn't...

438
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,514
God, you're such a girl.
Come on, it's my treat.

439
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:41,676
So was it an easy move?

440
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,685
- It was tough leaving my dad.
- Yeah.

441
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,146
My sister gave me some shit.

442
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,390
But timing was right.

443
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,276
Timing was really right.

444
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:53,571
- Is that your sister?
- No. My ex.

445
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,860
She's great. Loves John Mayer.

446
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,200
Wants us to stay friends.

447
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:03,410
She's also convinced she can cure me
of my emotional unavailability.

448
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:07,042
- You're emotionally unavailable?
- Oh, yeah.

449
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:10,705
Oh, my God. I'm emotionally damaged.
I haven't seen you at the meetings.

450
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,173
I'm done with the relationship thing.

451
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:15,468
Girl, you are preaching
to the congregation.

452
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:16,590
- Choir.
- What?

453
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,380
"Preaching to the choir." You're supposed
to preach to the congregation.

454
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,428
- That's the expression.
- Did you understand what I was saying?

455
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:22,596
Then don't be a dick about it.

456
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,436
Oh, my God. Do you mind?

457
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,351
- Please.
- Great.

458
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:31,105
Hello. You've reached
Dylan Harper's cell phone.

459
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:32,977
He's emotionally unavailable,
but if you'd like...

460
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,062
- John fucking Mayer!
- Hello?

461
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:40,527
Wow. Hello?
You really do have shitty cell service.

462
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,735
- Right?
- Yeah.

463
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,618
I'm gonna have some friends over tomorrow.

464
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:48,083
Why don't you come,
and you can meet some new people?

465
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,704
I'm gonna have to check my schedule.
I'm really busy.

466
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,289
I work at GQ now.
It's not some little blog on the Internet.

467
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,797
- Hey.
- Hey.

468
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,303
- You made it.
- Sorry I'm late.

469
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,094
No, no. Please, come in, come in.
Thank you.

470
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,095
Hey, everybody! Hey!

471
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:07,269
This here is Dylan. He's from LA.

472
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,890
He's the reason I can afford all this beer.

473
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:14,773
Okay, all right.

474
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,448
Am I an animal?

475
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:21,942
Yeah.

476
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,073
Fuck, I'm pretty good at this.

477
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:53,307
Lieutenant Kali's a West Coast street
artist I got into about five years ago.

478
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:56,645
- His postmodern interpretation...
- This shit is amazing.

479
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:57,816
I know, right?

480
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:05,445
You will be able to find the perfect candidate
to fill the position at your company.

481
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,154
Okay, here we go.

482
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,500
First up is Joey Morena,
who's fluent in Vietnamese

483
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,665
and has had 10 years of experience
in the culinary field.

484
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,137
I can't do this any more.

485
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,174
No, I think we both need to go get happy.

486
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,639
It's not adding up to a hundred any more.

487
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:30,810
Yeah.

488
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,729
Looks like New York's
all out of blueberries.

489
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,230
Goodbye, Flapjack.

490
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:38,019
Taxi! Taxicab!

491
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,311
Flapjack.

492
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:41,864
Why do all these movies
have such bad music?

493
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,700
It's so that you know how to feel
every single second.

494
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:45,905
"I'm heartbroken."

495
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,572
"I'm getting married
to the man of my dreams."

496
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,661
"I'm sneaking through an office."

497
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,006
Madison, wait!

498
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,426
Madison!

499
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:04,420
Madison, wait!

500
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:06,593
Bryce.

501
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,391
How did you know
I was at Grand Central Station?

502
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,352
You're not. You're in Los Angeles,
where this movie was shot.

503
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:14,226
I know you better than you know yourself.

504
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:18,191
And your crazy friend Susie
across the hall told me.

505
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:19,943
Susie.

506
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,196
Why are you here?

507
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:23,613
To tel/ you that

508
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:26,609
I love that sunsets make you cry

509
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:30,078
and I don't care that you failed
your real estate exam,

510
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,619
and I'm glad that you
have a five-date rule.

511
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,784
And that I love you.

512
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,957
Not as much as I love you.

513
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,587
Now boarding, track 5, love.

514
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,427
God, I wish my life was a movie sometimes.

515
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,551
You know, I'd never have to worry
about my hair,

516
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,389
or having to go to the bathroom.

517
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,976
And then, when I'm at my lowest point,

518
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:55,433
some guy would chase me down the street,
pour his heart out,

519
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:56,643
and we'd kiss.

520
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:58,816
Happily ever after.

521
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,607
I mean, a horse and carriage?

522
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,774
Come on, that is awesome.

523
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:08,367
Not as awesome as this
ambiguously upbeat pop song

524
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:10,069
that has nothing to do with the plot

525
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:14,908
they put in at the end to try to convince you
that you had a great time at this shitty movie.

526
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,953
You know, why don't they ever make a movie
about what happens after the big kiss?

527
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,250
They do. It's called porn.

528
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:24,250
God, I miss sex.

529
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:27,628
Right? I mean, sometimes you just need it.
It's like...

530
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,639
I don't know, it's like cracking your neck.

531
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,800
Why does it always gotta
come with complications?

532
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,802
- And emotions.
- And guilt.

533
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,303
Guilt.

534
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,681
- It's women's fault.
- What?

535
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:42,522
You heard me. "Hold me.
Let's spend the rest of our lives together."

536
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:44,020
Oh, please, you are no better.

537
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:47,983
"Oh, yeah, baby, come on, now.
Say my name. Yeah..."

538
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:50,693
"I'm done. How was I?"

539
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:51,819
Who have you been with?

540
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,825
Why can't it not be like that?

541
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:59,368
It's a physical act. Like playing tennis.

542
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:02,046
Two people should be able to have sex
like they're playing tennis.

543
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,960
Yeah, I mean, no one wants to
go away for the weekend

544
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,336
after they play tennis.

545
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,711
It's just a game.
You shake hands, get on with your shit.

546
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,174
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

547
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:13,890
Do you want more beer?

548
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:16,014
Okay.

549
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:24,817
- Jamie!
- Yeah?

550
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,112
- Let's play tennis.
- What?

551
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,564
Let's have sex like we're playing tennis.

552
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:29,906
Get the hell out of here.

553
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,694
Don't laugh. This could be great.

554
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,407
This could take all the
weirdness out of it.

555
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,951
Well, we talked about this.
I don't like you like that.

556
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,579
I don't like you like that either.
That's why it's perfect.

557
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:42,499
I don't even know if I find you attractive.

558
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:43,704
That's cute.

559
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,422
Well, I do have a thing for jerks.

560
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,167
Okay, well, do you even find me attractive?

561
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,672
- That's cute.
- No, no, no.

562
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,220
Before you got to know
my awesome personality.

563
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,380
Strictly physical.

564
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:55,678
First time you saw me.

565
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,223
- This is just two people talking?
- Yeah.

566
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,724
Two girls over drinks at Bennigan's. Go.

567
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:07,395
I liked your eyes. I didn't think
I'd ever seen such big, beautiful eyes.

568
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,529
Your lips. Yeah.
I thought you might be a good kisser.

569
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,031
I am.

570
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,904
- Your breasts.
- What about them?

571
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,326
- They intrigued me.
- Really?

572
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,703
- Yeah.
- I think they're so tiny.

573
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,747
- They're still breasts.
- Thanks.

574
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,454
- I liked your hands.
- Mouth.

575
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:26,834
- Butt.
- Voice.

576
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:27,961
- Chest.
- Eyes.

577
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,628
- You said that.
- I meant it.

578
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,760
You swear you don't want anything more
from me other than sex?

579
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,599
You swear you don't want anything
more from me?

580
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:41,266
I know how you girls get.
Tick-took, tick-took.

581
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,433
Stop it.

582
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:47,443
- What are you doing?
- I'm pulling up my Bible app.

583
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,400
- You have a Bible app?
- Yes. I am a good girl.

584
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:51,776
- Hand on the iPad.
- Okay.

585
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,277
Wait, no.

586
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,612
Why can't they figure this out?

587
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:58,112
No... This thing thinks
I'm you and you're me.

588
00:28:58,237 --> 00:28:59,705
Keep your hand still. I'll move the iPad.

589
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,123
- It's actually making me dizzy.
- Hold on.

590
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:03,666
There we go.

591
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,456
No relationship.

592
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,003
No emotions.

593
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,751
Just sex.

594
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:15,462
Whatever happens, we stay friends.

595
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,927
- Swear.
- Swear.

596
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,307
Okay.

597
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,318
So I guess we should just start.

598
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:32,817
Okay.

599
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:34,982
I'll serve.

600
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:37,405
That's really...
That's enough of the tennis.

601
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:38,576
Let's go to the bedroom.

602
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:40,654
What's wrong with the couch?
It's less emotional.

603
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,122
The bedroom has better light.

604
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:44,913
And since we're just friends,
I don't have to be insecure about my body.

605
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:46,994
Come on, okay? You're beautiful.

606
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,167
You have nothing to be insecure about.

607
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:53,209
No, you see,
that is way too emotionally supportive

608
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,301
and you need to just lock that down.

609
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:59,640
- Your ass is a little bony.
- Much better.

610
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,684
My nipples are sensitive,
I don't like dirty talk,

611
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,805
and had I known this was gonna happen,
I would have shaved my legs this morning.

612
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,436
My chin is ticklish,
I sneeze sometimes after I come,

613
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,983
and if I'd have known
this was gonna happen,

614
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,275
I wouldn't have shaved
my legs this morning.

615
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,523
Okie-dokie.

616
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,153
I keep my socks on. Intimacy issues.

617
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,155
Great, 'cause feet gross me out.
Daddy issues.

618
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,577
Great.

619
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:25,995
I can work with that.

620
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:29,916
Should be fine.

621
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:34,250
I can't believe I'm doing this.

622
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,301
Should we stop? We could just go for a run.

623
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,923
I don't know, are we
getting too old for this?

624
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:40,597
- Sex?
- No, casual sex.

625
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:43,433
It just, I don't know,
feels a little collegey.

626
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:45,560
- I could sing some Third Eye Blind.
- Okay.

627
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,475
- That's not Third Eye Blind.
- I'm pretty sure that's Third Eye Blind.

628
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:52,605
Nope.

629
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,573
- What's wrong?
- We're just doing this once.

630
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,862
- I totally agree.
- Okay.

631
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,158
- Great.
- Great.

632
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,451
Little faster.

633
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,571
- More circular.
- Watch my chin.

634
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,080
- Touch my ears.
- Okay.

635
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:08,959
Kiss my neck.

636
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,628
- Say my name.
- Dylan Francis Harper Jr.

637
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:12,746
Not my full name.

638
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,088
Sorry, I had to fill out
a lot of your paperwork.

639
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,253
- Stop talking.
- Okay.

640
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,251
Oh, my God, you're really...

641
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:24,593
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I,
J, K, L, M, N, O, P...

642
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,060
- Dylan, I...
- Relax.

643
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,308
Just a friend going down on another friend.

644
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,147
Oh, yeah, baby. Tornado.

645
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:36,441
What, what?

646
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,697
What are you trying to do?
Dig your way to China?

647
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:40,149
- I'm good at this.
- Says who?

648
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,616
Every girl I've been with.

649
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,111
Well, they're either lying
or their vaginas are made out of burlap.

650
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:46,120
So, relax. You're not a lizard.

651
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,948
- Okay, fine.
- Okay, fine.

652
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,244
- A little to the right.
- Okay.

653
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,079
- A little bit more to the left.
- Roger that.

654
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,630
- Now go down.
- Here we go.

655
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,258
- A little more... Whoa, too far!
- Sorry.

656
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,257
- What's wrong?
- Nothing!

657
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,842
When women start to scream,
it could be misconstrued.

658
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:08,435
Just keep going!

659
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:19,025
Yeah, you know it.

660
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,823
Well, let me tell you how I like it.

661
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,746
See, most girls think
you should start off soft,

662
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:32,292
but if you just get in,
really go for it, ..

663
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,507
Yeah, you know it.

664
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:08,954
- Let's go with Obama.
- No, no, no, no!

665
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:11,873
It's too easy, too predictable.
Go with Shaun.

666
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:16,871
He's stylish, transcendent of sport,
has an ass like a kumquat.

667
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,873
- I hear he's kind of a jerk.
- No, he's not.

668
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,087
You're just threatened by him

669
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,631
because he's the greatest snow
sport athlete in the universe

670
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,678
and he gets more squirrel than an oak tree.

671
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:27,927
Hey, Dylan?
Jamie Rellis is in the lobby for you.

672
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:29,095
Okay, thanks.

673
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,514
Let's hit this after lunch. Okay, guys?

674
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:34,180
Nobody wants to fuck Obama, brah.

675
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,605
He's got ears like an elephant.

676
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,895
That's not the part of
an elephant you want.

677
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:43,063
- Hi!
- Hi.

678
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,277
Sorry to just show up like this.

679
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:49,569
No, no, no, it's fine.

680
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:51,409
So...

681
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,246
- Wanna take a walk?
- Love to.

682
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,627
Great. Okay.

683
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,713
Okay, so about what happened, I...

684
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,672
- It was crazy and we shouldn't have done it.
- Exactly. No, no, exactly.

685
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,006
I mean, it is so not me.

686
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:11,091
I totally agree. Let's forget it happened.

687
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:14,762
Great. I mean, look,
I've had one-night stands.

688
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:18,106
We both have had one-night stands,
none of which we're proud of, but...

689
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:20,100
Really?

690
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,149
Look, to think that you and I
could just have sex

691
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,443
and without it compromising anything
was just so...

692
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,903
- Misguided.
- Exactly.

693
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,492
I was gonna call you this morning.

694
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:30,781
But you didn't.

695
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:31,945
But I didn't.

696
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:34,285
And you see, it's already
coming between us and I really...

697
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:35,703
I just don't want it to.

698
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:36,829
It's not going to.

699
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,829
Look, I know that I act all tough
and I talk all tough, but really...

700
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:42,752
It's just a front to protect yourself
from your own vulnerability.

701
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:45,292
What are you, my fucking therapist now?

702
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:50,097
No, I'm a friend. Who knows that
every time you curse, you blink.

703
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:53,642
- Like your body's rejecting the word.
- It does not.

704
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,801
- Fuck you.
- Blinked.

705
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,644
- No, I didn't fucking blink.
- Blinked again.

706
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,430
- Shit.
- Ah, didn't blink.

707
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:00,106
"Shit" you're okay with.

708
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:02,188
- It was stupid.
- Yes.

709
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:05,188
- We're friends, let's stay friends.
- Yes. Yes, this, I don't wanna lose this.

710
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:06,438
Me neither.

711
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:07,647
- Great.
- Fantastic.

712
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,612
Portrait for the lovely couple?

713
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:19,785
- What the hell are we doing?
- I don't know.

714
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:24,335
- Rub my hair.
- Kiss my neck.

715
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:28,506
- Watch my nipple.
- All right, all right.

716
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:32,010
- I didn't know you had a tattoo.
- Yeah.

717
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:33,465
Why didn't I notice that before?

718
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,050
Because we were drunk.

719
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,143
- Was it your dog?
- No. Never had one.

720
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:38,394
But everyone else did.

721
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,184
And I thought having a dog
meant you had a normal family,

722
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:41,978
which at 17 I desperately wanted.

723
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,980
So as a sign of rebellion you got a tattoo

724
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:45,652
of the most conventional thing
you could think of.

725
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,354
It was super awesome back then.

726
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,654
- Check it.
- Okay.

727
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,107
- A lightning bolt?
- Eighteen.

728
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,407
- Wanted superpowers.
- Yeah.

729
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:54,236
I was a little into Harry Potter back then.

730
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:56,955
- Were you also gay back then?
- Harry Potter doesn't make you gay!

731
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,828
- Okay.
- Are you sure about this?

732
00:35:58,907 --> 00:35:59,954
- Are you?
- No.

733
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:01,205
Me neither.

734
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,883
- How was your day?
- It was okay.

735
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,218
- I had a turkey sandwich for lunch.
- How was that?

736
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,053
It wasn't that good. How was your day?

737
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,548
Still trying to figure out that
subway system. It is tricky.

738
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:18,886
And it's out of here!

739
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:26,898
- My butt.
- What?

740
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,565
- Oh, my butt.
- Really?

741
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:31,823
No, I mean my butt, it's cramping.
Can you grab a pillow?

742
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,115
Okay, yeah, yeah.

743
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,240
- So, no butt?
- No.

744
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:42,208
- Really? Already?
- Just kidding.

745
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:49,420
- Do you like this position?
- Yeah, it's all right.

746
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,262
I gotta be honest, I feel
a little emasculated.

747
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:59,138
A naked girl is lying on top of you
and you feel emasculated?

748
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,687
- Little bit.
- You do know what that word means, right?

749
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,810
Yes, I know what it means, and I feel it.

750
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,104
Okay, all right, you big baby.

751
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,394
- Chinese fire drill.
- Okay. Go!

752
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:12,776
Okay.

753
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,076
- Do you feel manly now?
- I do.

754
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:18,494
Okay. Put it in.

755
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:20,947
That's not funny.

756
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:22,783
- It's kind of funny.
- It's kind of funny.

757
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:28,459
- Hold on.
- What's wrong?

758
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,581
I have to go to the bathroom.

759
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,008
- What? Now?
- Yes, now. I had a lot of watermelon.

760
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:44,350
What's going on in there?

761
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:46,098
Do you know how hard it is
to pee with a hard-on?

762
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:47,228
No, actually.

763
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:49,605
It's like two lanes of traffic
merging into one. It takes time.

764
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,776
- Are you pooping?
- No.

765
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:59,987
- Why are you sitting down?
- It's easier to control.

766
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,994
- You want a mess in here?
- No. No, no. Sorry.

767
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,175
Yeah.

768
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,010
Yup...

769
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,226
What? Did I leak?

770
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:25,345
Did you wash your hands?

771
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:26,892
Oh, come on, dude.

772
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,640
I know we're just friends,
but I'm still a lady.

773
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:32,360
Now get back in there, wash your hands
and then bring that fine ass back here.

774
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:35,026
If you keep talking to me like that,
I'm not gonna come back.

775
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:43,572
- My hammies are killing me.
- Have a banana, they're in the fridge.

776
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,074
Why would you keep bananas in the fridge?

777
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:47,538
- It dries them out.
- It doesn't. They have a peel.

778
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,161
It's not armor. Air still gets in.

779
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:50,496
Do you want a banana or not?

780
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,080
Not if they're dry. I'm not an animal.

781
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,879
At least I have food in the house.

782
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,840
All you have at home is drinkable yogurt.

783
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,171
I like to drink my yogurt.
It's a timesaver.

784
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:02,724
Well, then you think you could use
that time to shave your stubble.

785
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,309
Your whiskers are like knives.

786
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:08,059
Now, see, if you were my girlfriend,
I couldn't tell you to shut up right now.

787
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:10,565
And because you're just my buddy,
I can tell you

788
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:15,404
that if you don't start shaving up here,
I'm gonna stop shaving down there.

789
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:21,492
Hey, hey. Hey...

790
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:23,115
- Mom!
- "Mom"?

791
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:27,120
My eyes are covered.
I don't know what you're doing.

792
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,914
I can't see you putting on
your black underpants.

793
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,002
Jamie, baby, I missed you.

794
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,421
On, baby.

795
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,924
Did your boobs get bigger?
Mom, I'm over here.

796
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:39,051
Hey, baby. Oh, no, they didn't.

797
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:42,973
- What are you doing here?
- Victor turned out to be a total Lombard.

798
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:46,601
L-O-M-B-A-R-D.
"Lots Of Money But A Real Dullard."

799
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:47,970
Victor, her fiancé.

800
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,471
Ex-fiancé.

801
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:51,644
- What happened?
- Nothing. He was just blah.

802
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,607
I mean, nice, but it was
like talking to dirt.

803
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:56,444
I woke up one day and I said, "Lorna..."
I'm Lorna.

804
00:39:57,437 --> 00:40:00,281
- Dylan.
- I said, "Lorna, this is not your bliss."

805
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,366
- "Just because you're 39..."
- Forty-eight.

806
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:05,070
"...It doesn't mean you have to settle.
He's not an insurance claim."

807
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,030
So I caught the first plane off the island.

808
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,787
- Cleveland's not an island.
- Oh, baby, it is.

809
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,744
Anyway, here I am. It's so good to see you.

810
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:15,250
You never told me you had a hot boyfriend.

811
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:17,207
He's not my boyfriend, Mom.

812
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,167
- That's right, we're just friends.
- I love it.

813
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:21,670
It's like the '70s in here.

814
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:24,635
That was a better time. Just sex.

815
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:27,805
A little grass, a little glue...
Not during pregnancy.

816
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,599
Well, not during the final trimester.

817
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:32,180
But no complications. It's great!

818
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,854
Okay, well, that's technically, I guess,
what this is.

819
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:37,314
That's exactly what this is.

820
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,278
So my daughter is just your slampiece?

821
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,322
No, no. "Slampiece"?

822
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,658
I'm just kidding. Slam away.

823
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,113
Have fun. I think this is great.

824
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:46,820
The only thing is, it
takes you off the market.

825
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,954
But what the hell.
The whole reason you go to the market

826
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,783
is to buy the produce,
which you already got.

827
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:56,997
It's so good to see you, baby.
I'm only gonna be here a few weeks.

828
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,998
I'm starving. You got any gin?

829
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:00,959
It's in the kitchen.

830
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,507
You gotta go.

831
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:06,306
- Is she wearing Axe body spray?
- I don't know. Come on.

832
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:08,679
Bananas in the refrigerator?
What are you, Puerto Rican?

833
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:12,558
- That is terrible, Mother.
- Just joking. Your dad was Puerto Rican.

834
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,181
What? You said that he was Greek.

835
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:15,815
- Potato, potato...
- Get your shoes.

836
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,439
- Okay. All right.
- Well, not... Just go, just go.

837
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:20,065
I'll just put these on on the bike?

838
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,233
- Yeah.
- Okay.

839
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:22,901
It was nice to have met you...

840
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,615
- Hey.
- And your pants are coming off.

841
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:26,739
Oh, my... Mom! Mom, please!

842
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,029
Back, back!

843
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,919
That's what I'm talking about!

844
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:39,206
We're kicking every gay ass out here!

845
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:41,758
I don't say that pejoratively,
I say it hopefully.

846
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:43,376
Hold it. Any of you gay?

847
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:45,045
- Not even you?
- Come on, man.

848
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,263
Come talk to me after.
Give me five minutes of your time.

849
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,098
I might be able to let you see some reason.

850
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:57,015
Look at you in the house!

851
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:58,224
Come on, baby!

852
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:00,852
I'm supposed to meet up with Jamie.

853
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,609
Who's that, that headhunter?

854
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,198
What, you guys going out now?

855
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:07,901
No, no, no, we're just friends.
We're messing around a little bit.

856
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:09,994
- What do you mean?
- Sleeping together.

857
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,366
But it's just sex.

858
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:13,073
That never works, bro.

859
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:16,918
She's a girl. Sex always means more
to them even if they don't admit it.

860
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:18,168
Jamie's different.

861
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,838
Does she have a penis
where most girls have a vagina?

862
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,586
- No penis.
- Then she's no different.

863
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,292
What do you know about women, anyway?

864
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:27,091
Dude, I've turned down more tail
than you'll ever have.

865
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,303
Yeah, bro. You're gay.

866
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:32,259
But the offers still keep rolling
in, naturally. Look at me.

867
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:38,640
And, hey, I love women. They're beautiful,
majestic, mysterious, mesmerizing creatures.

868
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:42,736
Smart, empathetic.
Far superior to men in every way.

869
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:46,572
And if I had a choice,
I would be with women to my dying day.

870
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:49,821
But me likes cock so I'm
strict-aly dick-aly.

871
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:53,246
So it's always just about sex, then?

872
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:56,666
No. I've been in love.
I went down that rabbit hole.

873
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,288
You know what I discovered?

874
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:01,045
It's not who you want to spend
Friday night with,

875
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,589
it's who you want to spend
all day Saturday with.

876
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:04,756
Feel me, Felix?

877
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:08,177
Yeah, but then it's every Saturday
for the rest of your life.

878
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:10,096
It's okay, you don't get it.

879
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:12,511
It's no big deal. But you will.

880
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:17,099
One day, you'll meet someone
and it'll literally take your breath away.

881
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:21,357
Like you can't breathe.
Like no oxygen to the lungs.

882
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:23,860
- Like a fish...
- Yeah, I get it, Tommy.

883
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:25,444
Yeah, you don't.

884
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:28,356
Nice work on that new online site,
by the way.

885
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:30,317
What was the font on that headline?

886
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,700
It was Times Roman.

887
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:34,116
Times Roman. Inspired. I'm out.

888
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,707
You have a boat?

889
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:45,169
I live in Jersey.
And I ain't taking no ferry.

890
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:47,709
Unless it's out to dinner and a show.

891
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,017
- Hey.
- Yeah.

892
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:10,445
You and that Dylan? Way to go.
I mean the whole friendship-sex thing.

893
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:12,196
Kudos, baby, kudos.

894
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:15,036
It's not that big of a deal.

895
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:19,161
It's just surprising. I always thought
you were a true-love kind of girl.

896
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,539
Whatever, Mom. It's not like
it's stopping me from anything.

897
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:24,545
That's what I thought back in '78.

898
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,672
And every year since.

899
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,258
I'm just... I'm flattered, actually.

900
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,343
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

901
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,009
It's just surprising.

902
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:38,225
- There, done. It's... There we go.
- Okay.

903
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:42,848
You look great! You look great.
You look like a princess.

904
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:44,728
- Yeah!
- Really?

905
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:46,234
- Yeah.
- Okay.

906
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:50,196
Hey, my friend gave me his house
in Montauk for July 4th.

907
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:53,195
Let's you and me go away together.
No men, no bullshit.

908
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:56,073
Just mother-daughter.
Like a Nora Ephron movie.

909
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:59,410
When was the last time
we spent a full weekend together?

910
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:02,576
When I was eight, that time in Vermont.
We got snowed in with the ski instructor.

911
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,792
- Demitri.
- Bill.

912
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,253
He reminded me a lot of your father.

913
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:08,923
Dark curls, olive skin, Cold War accent.

914
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,883
- My father was Russian?
- I don't remember.

915
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:14,091
But what I do remember is we drank
a lot of vodka and shot a lot of guns.

916
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:17,757
Mom, this "who's your daddy" game
is getting really old.

917
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:20,601
I know I haven't been
the best mother in the world...

918
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:25,064
I'm sorry,
were you waiting for me to jump in?

919
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:28,393
Come on! Go away with me. Come on!

920
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:31,070
Come on. Come on.

921
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:34,323
Okay, we'll do it. It'll be fun, yeah?

922
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:42,949
- Mom...
- I was trying to bond!

923
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:45,452
It was either this or sniff glue.

924
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,251
- Sorry about my mom.
- I thought she was funny.

925
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:56,133
Yeah, she's really funny
when she's asking for money,

926
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:58,803
and she's hilarious
when she needs a place to stay.

927
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:07,265
Dylan, I think I wanna start dating again.

928
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,144
Listen, I think we should stop this.

929
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:15,448
Yeah?

930
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,195
I kind of think you're right.

931
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:18,317
Right?

932
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:24,033
Every new beginning
comes from some other beginning's end.

933
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:25,916
That actually makes sense right here.

934
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:27,960
Who would've thought Third Eye Blind
could be so prophetic?

935
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,161
Not Third Eye Blind.

936
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:31,005
I'm pretty sure that's Third Eye Blind.

937
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,289
Do you wanna go grab some lunch?

938
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:33,499
- Yes.
- Okay.

939
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:35,301
- You're buying.
- What?

940
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:38,637
Okay.

941
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:42,008
- Pants.
- Shirt.

942
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,847
So this is the end of this?

943
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,887
- I guess so. But it's good.
- Yeah.

944
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:47,389
- And we did it.
- With no bullshit.

945
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:48,560
- Shirt.
- Sweater.

946
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,316
We managed to actually stay friends.

947
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:52,810
- Yup.
- Yeah.

948
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,029
Okay. So, what is your type, anyway?

949
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:01,193
No, I don't have a type.

950
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,579
- It's more about what's inside.
- Oh, please!

951
00:47:03,696 --> 00:47:05,414
Okay, what about her?

952
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,038
Yeah. I could get to know her inside.

953
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:09,206
And she's reading a book.

954
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:11,333
It's probably Nicholas Sparks.

955
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,669
- I'm gonna go talk to her.
- What?

956
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,917
What do you mean, "What?"
We said we wanted to date again.

957
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:17,715
- I'm gonna go talk to her.
- Now?

958
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,337
Here, in front of all of these people?

959
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,723
I didn't say I was gonna rape her.
I said I was gonna go talk to her.

960
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:29,393
Excuse me. I'm Dylan. Nice to meet you.

961
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:31,015
The Notebook.

962
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:38,564
Nice meeting you.

963
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,825
- Well?
- We talked. We laughed.

964
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:46,030
Yeah.

965
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:48,411
- She's Belgian.
- Explains the reading.

966
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:50,163
I showed her where the balcony was,

967
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:52,916
because that's where
she is meeting up with her husband.

968
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:56,086
Anniversary trip to New York.

969
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:59,378
Three kids. Christof, Karlina and Pepijn.

970
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:01,550
Shut up.

971
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:05,432
Why are you still laughing?
At least I gave it a shot.

972
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:08,268
Fine. I'll go next.

973
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,938
- See if I still have game.
- Okay.

974
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:12,440
- Okay.
- Okay.

975
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,024
- Yes.
- Right here. Eleven o'clock.

976
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:16,860
- Iced coffee.
- Handsome, but doesn't know it.

977
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:20,444
Staring at a tree, which means
he's actually in the park for nature

978
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:22,116
and not to watch women sunbathe.

979
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:23,867
- Or he's retarded.
- Don't care.

980
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:25,069
I'm going in.

981
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,377
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

982
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:34,961
- Hi.
- Hello.

983
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:36,751
I'm Jamie.

984
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:39,626
Yeah. Yeah, that works.

985
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:42,629
Hi.

986
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:46,136
Okay.

987
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:47,390
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, my God!

988
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:56,894
Okay. His name is Parker.
He's a children's oncologist.

989
00:48:58,144 --> 00:48:59,817
And I have a date this Saturday.

990
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:02,319
- Nice.
- Thank you.

991
00:49:03,149 --> 00:49:04,947
Why'd you wave to me?

992
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:08,408
I told him you were my gay best friend,

993
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,239
so he wants to set you up with his brother.

994
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:16,792
College, med school,
and I haven't slept since.

995
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:19,206
I can't believe you actually cure cancer.

996
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,542
Well, me and God.

997
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:23,844
- What?
- I'm kidding.

998
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,673
Can you imagine
someone who would actually say that?

999
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,845
Yeah, I could.
I've been out with a lot of them.

1000
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,676
- Cancer doctors?
- No, assholes.

1001
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:32,390
Yeah.

1002
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:33,683
Well, hopefully you're all done with that.

1003
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:38,351
Although, I gotta warn you,
lot of cancer doctors, big assholes.

1004
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:39,477
- Really?
- Yeah.

1005
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:42,484
And brain surgeons, huge perverts.

1006
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:45,404
While they're doing this,
a little bit of that.

1007
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:48,027
Hey.

1008
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:50,700
Thank you.

1009
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:52,581
When can I see you again?

1010
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:57,703
Right now.

1011
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:00,582
- I'm just kidding.
- Okay.

1012
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,379
Can you imagine
someone who would actually say that?

1013
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:04,711
I played the tuba in high school.

1014
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:07,047
World's stupidest instrument.

1015
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,097
Especially when you move eight times.

1016
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:12,886
- Why'd you move?
- My mom really likes to break up with guys,

1017
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:14,429
and she was really good at it.

1018
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:16,848
- Was your dad one of them?
- No, no, he was long before that.

1019
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:18,561
I actually never knew my dad.

1020
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:20,268
I'm sorry. That sucks.

1021
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,573
All right, look, I think I should
probably tell you something.

1022
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:27,199
Please don't tell me you're a dude.

1023
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:29,527
Because that'll be like the third time
since I moved here,

1024
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:31,237
and I don't think I can handle that.

1025
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:32,576
I have a five-date rule.

1026
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:36,079
- You know, like, five dates before we...
- Yeah.

1027
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:38,957
I saw it in a movie.
I thought I'd give it a try.

1028
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:41,293
You're worth waiting for.

1029
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:44,257
I'm sure that was the line
in the movie you saw.

1030
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,086
That's awesome.

1031
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:50,052
This four-year-old that I've been
working on for the last couple months,

1032
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:51,303
he's gonna be fine.

1033
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:52,762
- That's great.
- Yeah.

1034
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:55,219
How is a guy like you single?

1035
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:58,306
I've just been waiting for someone
to come up to me in the park

1036
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:00,941
and compliment me for looking at the trees
and not the sunbathers.

1037
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,435
I meant it. It was impressive.

1038
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,562
Actually, if I'm gonna be
completely honest with you,

1039
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:06,363
I was sleeping standing up.

1040
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:09,567
I worked 36 hours straight.
I don't even know how I got to the park.

1041
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:11,827
How is a girl like you single?

1042
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:14,905
I have issues.

1043
00:51:15,114 --> 00:51:16,661
One might even call me damaged.

1044
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:18,493
Actually, one did call me damaged.

1045
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:19,743
Get out of here. Damaged how?

1046
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:21,669
I kind of believe in true love.

1047
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,923
That there might be
a Prince Charming out there for me.

1048
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:35,226
Listen, I know this is probably a no
because all you do is work like a dull boy,

1049
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:37,645
but would you like to come get a beer?

1050
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:38,762
I'm good.

1051
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:40,598
No, it's not a gay bar.

1052
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:44,652
And there'll be just as many hot girls
as hot guys.

1053
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:49,031
You know what? I will come out.

1054
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:51,942
All right. Let's find you a lady.

1055
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:54,111
You're still not gay, right?

1056
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,491
- Nope.
- Okay.

1057
00:52:01,327 --> 00:52:03,000
- What?
- Do you know what today is?

1058
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:06,336
- Date number five.
- I wasn't even counting.

1059
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:14,640
- Wanna go in the bedroom?
- No. Here's fine.

1060
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:23,190
I am so glad I met you tonight.

1061
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:25,229
Me, too.

1062
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:31,031
What are you thinking?

1063
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:34,155
Just how great you are.

1064
00:52:45,746 --> 00:52:47,168
Annie, hey.

1065
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,591
Who the fuck is Annie?

1066
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:50,925
My sister.

1067
00:52:51,043 --> 00:52:53,045
Better be. I'll cut her.

1068
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:56,719
Of course I'm coming.

1069
00:52:57,049 --> 00:53:01,225
Yeah, I'm taking the 4th off,
so I'll be there for three days.

1070
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,524
Yeah. How's Dad?

1071
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,401
Any worse?

1072
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:17,866
All right, tell him I said hi.

1073
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:20,239
Bye, Banannie.

1074
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:26,253
I want you to meet my parents.

1075
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,793
No, you... Really?

1076
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:37,593
God!

1077
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,993
Hey. Hold on, hold on.

1078
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:01,238
No, just hold on. Just give me a second.

1079
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:04,120
I gotta go find a place to talk. Okay.

1080
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:08,458
Shit. Shit. Just hold Oh.

1081
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:09,751
- Oh, sorry.
- Hold on.

1082
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:11,423
I was out pretty late last night.

1083
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:14,673
When I got in, you and your girlfriend
were on the couch

1084
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,340
so I just crashed in your bed.

1085
00:54:16,462 --> 00:54:18,135
- He's not a girl.
- He smells like a girl.

1086
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:20,516
- You smelled him?
- I wanna buy marshmallows.

1087
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:23,226
- What did you say?
- For Montauk this weekend.

1088
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:26,101
I wanna do a campfire,
like when you were little.

1089
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,272
Okay.

1090
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:30,317
- And then we're gonna look for sticks.
- I hear you. Sticks.

1091
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:33,313
And then we're gonna sing. We're gonna...

1092
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:35,447
Just hold on a second.

1093
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,612
Okay.

1094
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:40,865
Okay.

1095
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:47,083
What's up?

1096
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:49,127
Do you think guys care more
about global warming

1097
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:51,626
or how to wear white pants to a cookout?

1098
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:52,831
We/I, that depends.

1099
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,630
Do you have a hot model in a bikini
standing on an icecap?

1100
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,427
No. Ski slope.

1101
00:54:57,503 --> 00:54:59,471
I'd still go with pants to a cookout.

1102
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:01,177
Yeah, me, too.

1103
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:04,514
How's your boy Parker?
Still staring at trees?

1104
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:06,888
Two coffees.
Yeah, he's still looking up at trees,

1105
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:09,231
but this time it's
actually in my apartment.

1106
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:11,726
- It's the fifth date already?
- Maybe. Thank you.

1107
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,569
Did you guys "fifth-date""?

1108
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:18,361
- How dare you! A lady never tells.
- I know. That's why I'm asking you.

1109
00:55:21,902 --> 00:55:24,746
Hey. I gotta go. You have a great
trip in LA and call me when you land.

1110
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:26,198
Okay.

1111
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:27,745
Parker.

1112
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:29,705
Hey.

1113
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,838
I got us coffees.
Nonfat, one sugar, one Splenda.

1114
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:36,041
- I gotta get going.
- What?

1115
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,418
I thought you weren't on call today.

1116
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:40,843
I'm not, but I got that thing...
I got stuff.

1117
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:42,548
This... They just called me.

1118
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:46,518
- Really?
- Yeah.

1119
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:49,897
The sneak-out.
How incredibly cliché of you.

1120
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,390
I just...

1121
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:54,268
I don't think I can be
your Prince Charming.

1122
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:57,237
God, you totally didn't get
anything that I was saying, did you?

1123
00:55:57,354 --> 00:56:00,699
- No, no, no. I think you're great.
- Yeah, you, too.

1124
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,697
Hey, you know what?
You and I should stay friends.

1125
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:05,223
- Really?
- No, go fuck yourself.

1126
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,343
Who sleeps standing up?

1127
00:56:17,836 --> 00:56:19,008
You know, you'd be really proud of me.

1128
00:56:19,129 --> 00:56:21,097
I didn't even blink
when I told him to go fuck himself.

1129
00:56:21,172 --> 00:56:24,847
- You did just then, though.
- This does not count. I'm not in the moment.

1130
00:56:25,468 --> 00:56:27,141
I don't know, maybe I suck in bed.

1131
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:28,563
Trust me, you don't suck in bed.

1132
00:56:29,347 --> 00:56:31,190
- Thank you.
- So needy.

1133
00:56:31,307 --> 00:56:32,934
Hey, maybe the guy's married or something.

1134
00:56:33,017 --> 00:56:34,860
No, did a background check at work.

1135
00:56:34,978 --> 00:56:38,073
Single, no criminal history,
credit report 720.

1136
00:56:38,189 --> 00:56:39,782
Background check. Did you do one on me?

1137
00:56:39,858 --> 00:56:42,077
How could you possibly
max out an Old Navy card?

1138
00:56:42,193 --> 00:56:44,366
After college I was
really into cargo pants.

1139
00:56:46,072 --> 00:56:47,915
Dylan, I gotta stop thinking it's not me.

1140
00:56:48,032 --> 00:56:50,285
- I mean, it's gotta be me.
- It's not you.

1141
00:56:50,368 --> 00:56:51,620
Nothing is wrong with you.

1142
00:56:51,703 --> 00:56:53,705
He's a guy.
You gave him a five-date challenge,

1143
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:56,208
he got you and cutout. Forget the douche.

1144
00:56:56,332 --> 00:56:58,755
He's a dick. He's a dick-douche.

1145
00:56:59,919 --> 00:57:01,421
Go have fun with your mom.

1146
00:57:01,921 --> 00:57:05,095
- Okay.
- Almost forgot. I got you something.

1147
00:57:12,724 --> 00:57:15,398
It's Lieutenant Kali,
the street artist we talked about.

1148
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:18,063
I got him to do something for you.
"F-tale." Fairytale.

1149
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:21,904
- I know you're into that girly shit, so...
- This is so cool.

1150
00:57:23,026 --> 00:57:24,994
Dylan, that's actually really sweet.

1151
00:57:25,069 --> 00:57:27,071
- It's cool, right?
- Yeah. Thank you.

1152
00:57:28,907 --> 00:57:30,580
Hey, I'm gonna need to borrow cab fare.

1153
00:57:31,743 --> 00:57:33,916
I'm not taking that thing on the subway.
I don't wanna get rolled.

1154
00:57:34,037 --> 00:57:35,129
No problem.

1155
00:57:35,246 --> 00:57:37,248
As long as you get your feet off my bed.
They're disgusting.

1156
00:57:39,542 --> 00:57:40,634
What are you doing?

1157
00:57:40,752 --> 00:57:42,049
Why are you doing that?
Why are you doing that?

1158
00:57:42,587 --> 00:57:44,464
You're an animal. Stop doing that.
An animal. Stop.

1159
00:57:48,593 --> 00:57:50,061
Hey, Ma.

1160
00:57:51,387 --> 00:57:53,810
Ma. Come on, we gotta get on the road.

1161
00:57:54,265 --> 00:57:55,608
Come on.

1162
00:57:55,725 --> 00:57:57,147
Ma?

1163
00:58:15,787 --> 00:58:17,664
Why did I think that
this time would be any different?

1164
00:58:17,789 --> 00:58:19,416
- Come with me to LA.
- What?

1165
00:58:19,499 --> 00:58:22,218
What else are you gonna do?
It's 4th of July, everybody's left the city.

1166
00:58:22,293 --> 00:58:24,045
You're very sweet for
asking, but it's fine.

1167
00:58:24,128 --> 00:58:25,801
You know what, I'll just stay here.
I'll be fine alone.

1168
00:58:25,922 --> 00:58:28,141
I know you'll be fine alone.
You're not a baby in a hot car.

1169
00:58:29,133 --> 00:58:30,976
I'm actually asking you to come
because it would help me.

1170
00:58:31,302 --> 00:58:33,020
You'd be a great distraction for my family.

1171
00:58:33,137 --> 00:58:35,310
They'd forget all about
drilling me for being single.

1172
00:58:35,473 --> 00:58:36,645
Won't they think that we're together?

1173
00:58:36,766 --> 00:58:38,814
- Not if I tell them we're not.
- And they'll believe you?

1174
00:58:38,935 --> 00:58:41,313
Yeah, we're one of these crazy families
that doesn't lie to each other.

1175
00:58:41,437 --> 00:58:42,780
PBS is doing a documentary on us.

1176
00:58:42,981 --> 00:58:44,028
Come on, they'll love you.

1177
00:58:44,148 --> 00:58:46,617
All fast-talking and brusque,
like I'm bringing home a carny.

1178
00:58:46,693 --> 00:58:49,788
You're really nice to ask,
but I'm just gonna stay here.

1179
00:58:49,862 --> 00:58:51,114
Go to the gym.

1180
00:58:51,364 --> 00:58:54,288
I just got you a ticket with my miles,
it's done. Meet me at JFK.

1181
00:58:54,367 --> 00:58:55,789
- But...
- No buts.

1182
00:58:55,868 --> 00:58:58,712
- Like you were gonna go to the gym.
- I wasn't.

1183
00:59:12,176 --> 00:59:13,803
LA's so nice.

1184
00:59:14,387 --> 00:59:16,230
And everyone's so genuine and level-headed.

1185
00:59:17,849 --> 00:59:20,853
Thanks for this. You're good peeps.

1186
00:59:21,019 --> 00:59:22,646
You're the good peeps, dude.

1187
00:59:22,729 --> 00:59:25,357
You haven't met my family.
You don't know what you're in for.

1188
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:28,322
Okay.

1189
00:59:28,568 --> 00:59:30,411
You know these planes
pretty much land themselves?

1190
00:59:30,528 --> 00:59:33,407
Nobody cares. You sound like an asshole.

1191
00:59:34,866 --> 00:59:36,243
She's from New York.

1192
00:59:36,367 --> 00:59:37,710
I'm sorry.

1193
00:59:48,379 --> 00:59:50,677
Wow. This looks normal.

1194
00:59:50,757 --> 00:59:52,009
It is.

1195
00:59:52,884 --> 00:59:54,010
Thank you.

1196
00:59:58,222 --> 01:00:00,099
Wow, you grew up here?

1197
01:00:00,725 --> 01:00:02,727
It was my grandfather's.

1198
01:00:02,894 --> 01:00:04,521
He bought it
when there was nothing else here.

1199
01:00:04,687 --> 01:00:06,906
My dad and my sister
and her son live here now.

1200
01:00:08,358 --> 01:00:10,235
Why would you move to New York?

1201
01:00:10,401 --> 01:00:11,903
I was conned by some headhunter.

1202
01:00:13,071 --> 01:00:14,573
- You're here.
- Sammy!

1203
01:00:14,739 --> 01:00:15,740
Hey, Uncle Dylan.

1204
01:00:15,907 --> 01:00:17,124
What's up, buddy?

1205
01:00:18,076 --> 01:00:19,168
How are you?

1206
01:00:19,243 --> 01:00:21,962
Jamie, this is my nephew,
Sam the Magnificent.

1207
01:00:22,205 --> 01:00:24,833
- Hello.
- May I offer you a light for your cigarette?

1208
01:00:24,916 --> 01:00:26,589
I'm sorry, I don't smoke.

1209
01:00:26,709 --> 01:00:28,507
Just pretend. He's a magician.

1210
01:00:28,586 --> 01:00:31,465
Of course I'll have a cigarette.
Smoking is great for you.

1211
01:00:34,759 --> 01:00:39,139
- Wow. Thank you, good sir.
- My pleasure, my lady.

1212
01:00:40,056 --> 01:00:41,399
Oh, my God. I got it, I got it.

1213
01:00:41,474 --> 01:00:43,647
Sammy. I got it, I got it.
Just stay still. I got it, I got it.

1214
01:00:43,768 --> 01:00:45,395
Sammy! Are you okay?

1215
01:00:45,478 --> 01:00:46,730
All part of the illusion.

1216
01:00:46,813 --> 01:00:48,440
- Jet Skis later?
- Definitely.

1217
01:00:49,482 --> 01:00:50,699
Still into magic, huh?

1218
01:00:50,775 --> 01:00:53,949
Yep. But I'll take that over him
sexting his friends any day.

1219
01:00:54,779 --> 01:00:56,998
- Dilbert!
- Banannie.

1220
01:00:58,324 --> 01:01:00,827
Jamie, this is my sister, Annie.

1221
01:01:00,952 --> 01:01:02,374
- Hi.
- Thank you for having me.

1222
01:01:02,453 --> 01:01:04,421
Oh, please.
It's nice to have Dylan bring a girl home.

1223
01:01:04,497 --> 01:01:06,090
- We're just friends.
- Oh, no, I know.

1224
01:01:06,165 --> 01:01:08,338
If you were his girlfriend,
he never would've brought you here.

1225
01:01:08,459 --> 01:01:11,133
- This one has intimacy issues.
- I know.

1226
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:12,342
- Dylan.
- Dad.

1227
01:01:12,463 --> 01:01:14,090
- Dylan. Oh, man.
- Hey.

1228
01:01:14,173 --> 01:01:16,551
- How you doing, buddy?
- I'm good.

1229
01:01:16,634 --> 01:01:18,602
I miss you guys, but I'm good.

1230
01:01:19,846 --> 01:01:21,018
Dede Spencer?

1231
01:01:21,472 --> 01:01:23,349
Jamie. Dylan's friend.

1232
01:01:25,518 --> 01:01:27,270
- I'm sorry. I...
- That's okay.

1233
01:01:27,353 --> 01:01:29,321
No, for a minute you reminded me
of a girl I used to know.

1234
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,824
- No, that's okay. It happens.
- Nice to meet you.

1235
01:01:31,941 --> 01:01:34,035
Pleasure meeting you.
You have a beautiful house.

1236
01:01:34,152 --> 01:01:35,153
Thank you.

1237
01:01:35,445 --> 01:01:38,619
Pool's a little cold,
but it's very expensive to heat, so...

1238
01:01:39,657 --> 01:01:41,659
I think I'm gonna goin
and check the tide tables

1239
01:01:41,784 --> 01:01:43,377
'cause I'm gonna take the boat out
early in the morning.

1240
01:01:43,494 --> 01:01:44,996
- You should come.
- I would love to.

1241
01:01:45,121 --> 01:01:46,714
We sold the boat.

1242
01:01:46,831 --> 01:01:48,833
The doctor doesn't want you
driving the boat any more.

1243
01:01:51,127 --> 01:01:53,004
- Turning to mush.
- No.

1244
01:01:54,630 --> 01:01:56,849
It's good to see you, buddy.

1245
01:01:57,008 --> 01:01:58,635
- Nice to meet you.
- It was nice meeting you, too.

1246
01:01:58,718 --> 01:02:00,470
- Jamie. See?
- Yes.

1247
01:02:05,475 --> 01:02:08,319
- What's with the pants?
- He doesn't like them any more.

1248
01:02:08,519 --> 01:02:10,362
He's getting worse.

1249
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:12,482
It's so good to have you here.

1250
01:02:13,691 --> 01:02:14,738
Go show her the beach.

1251
01:02:16,194 --> 01:02:18,242
- Let me show you the beach. Come on.
- Okay.

1252
01:02:18,362 --> 01:02:21,206
- Go, get sandy. Get all messed up.
- Okay.

1253
01:02:36,756 --> 01:02:38,804
Dylan never told me about your dad.

1254
01:02:38,883 --> 01:02:41,602
Yeah, it's been tough on him.
They were real close.

1255
01:02:42,261 --> 01:02:44,138
Dylan doesn't quite know
how to deal with the Alzheimer's.

1256
01:02:44,222 --> 01:02:45,439
I'm sorry.

1257
01:02:45,556 --> 01:02:48,150
He'll be his regular old self
and everything seems fine,

1258
01:02:48,226 --> 01:02:50,900
and then just in a flash, he's gone.

1259
01:02:52,855 --> 01:02:55,358
- That's Dylan when he was nine.
- Are those braids?

1260
01:02:55,608 --> 01:02:58,236
He was going through a Kris Kross phase.
Remember them?

1261
01:03:03,699 --> 01:03:06,452
- Is that your mom?
- No, that's Dylan's speech therapist.

1262
01:03:07,578 --> 01:03:10,548
He had a stutter.
It got real bad when he was nervous.

1263
01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:12,258
He had a rough childhood.

1264
01:03:12,416 --> 01:03:15,420
- His math tutor called it "character-building."
- Math tutor?

1265
01:03:15,545 --> 01:03:19,391
No, we're talking, like,
8 times 6 equals 1,200.

1266
01:03:19,465 --> 01:03:21,559
But he's very visual, thank God.

1267
01:03:21,801 --> 01:03:26,307
- Can you please explain to me this photo?
- That is my 12th-birthday surprise party.

1268
01:03:26,430 --> 01:03:28,478
- Hey.
- Amazing moment.

1269
01:03:28,599 --> 01:03:30,317
I'm exhausted. I'm gonna go to bed.

1270
01:03:30,434 --> 01:03:33,483
- Jamie, you all good with your room?
- Yeah. No, it's perfect.

1271
01:03:33,896 --> 01:03:35,648
Thank you. Thank you for everything.

1272
01:03:40,444 --> 01:03:43,664
Sammy and I built a saw-a-girl-in-half box,
so just be careful on your way to bed.

1273
01:03:43,781 --> 01:03:46,910
- He's not using a real saw, is he?
- Of course he is. He's magnificent.

1274
01:03:47,410 --> 01:03:50,789
I'll make sure he brushes his teeth,
and you, don't believe anything she says.

1275
01:03:50,913 --> 01:03:52,415
She's a liar.

1276
01:03:53,457 --> 01:03:55,926
- He's a pretty special guy.
- Yeah, I think so.

1277
01:03:58,671 --> 01:04:00,639
- Jamie. Hey.
- Hey.

1278
01:04:00,965 --> 01:04:02,137
- You up?
- Yeah. Come in.

1279
01:04:05,094 --> 01:04:06,892
- I thought you were going to bed.
- I was.

1280
01:04:06,971 --> 01:04:09,645
But then I realized
we were both single again, so...

1281
01:04:13,352 --> 01:04:14,979
- Dude, no.
- Why not?

1282
01:04:15,104 --> 01:04:16,981
I washed my hands. With soap this time.

1283
01:04:17,148 --> 01:04:19,025
Are you serious?
Why would you just assume?

1284
01:04:19,191 --> 01:04:22,866
You cracked your neck on the porch.
This thing. That's your tell, remember?

1285
01:04:23,029 --> 01:04:26,329
I cracked my neck
because we were on a flight for six hours,

1286
01:04:26,991 --> 01:04:29,870
and you were yapping my ear off
about how planes all fly themselves,

1287
01:04:29,994 --> 01:04:31,496
and it actually kinked my neck a bit.

1288
01:04:31,621 --> 01:04:34,340
- So, no?
- No. Not having sex with you.

1289
01:04:34,457 --> 01:04:36,710
Is it your special time?
They have an app for that. No, wait.

1290
01:04:39,670 --> 01:04:41,638
- Nope, you're good to go.
- We talked about this.

1291
01:04:41,714 --> 01:04:44,388
- Plus, I just got dumped, so...
- Okay, I'm sorry.

1292
01:04:44,508 --> 01:04:46,806
I thought this would be a good way
to take your mind off him.

1293
01:04:46,886 --> 01:04:49,014
No, I don't function that way.
Sex is not gonna help.

1294
01:04:49,472 --> 01:04:51,600
But you know what will? Emotional support.

1295
01:04:51,682 --> 01:04:54,561
Before we were sex without emotion,
and now we're emotion without sex.

1296
01:04:54,685 --> 01:04:56,107
Exactly.

1297
01:04:56,187 --> 01:04:58,030
I just need you to be my friend right now.

1298
01:04:58,147 --> 01:05:00,195
Okay. So I'll listen to you
while you give me a hand job.

1299
01:05:00,483 --> 01:05:02,827
- No.
- I'm kidding. I got it. Good night.

1300
01:05:03,069 --> 01:05:07,074
Wait, hold on! Friends can still hang out
and, I don't know, listen to music.

1301
01:05:07,323 --> 01:05:08,370
Listen to music?

1302
01:05:10,409 --> 01:05:11,535
I'm gonna kill Annie.

1303
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:15,374
- I can't believe you used to like them.
- I didn't like these guys.

1304
01:05:15,498 --> 01:05:16,545
I don't even remember...

1305
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:31,564
And then there's something,
I don't know what he says right there...

1306
01:05:34,058 --> 01:05:36,607
Are you kidding me?
These dudes were da bomb.

1307
01:05:36,727 --> 01:05:38,604
Everybody had Girbauds,
we all wore them backwards.

1308
01:05:38,729 --> 01:05:39,730
The baseball jerseys.

1309
01:05:41,565 --> 01:05:43,567
I went as Kris Kross
three years in a row for Halloween.

1310
01:05:43,693 --> 01:05:45,866
- Oh, you poor kid.
- I'm not proud of it.

1311
01:05:46,112 --> 01:05:49,742
Hey, I borrowed one of your books.
I hope that's okay.

1312
01:05:53,285 --> 01:05:54,582
Like this.

1313
01:05:57,039 --> 01:05:58,086
No.

1314
01:06:06,799 --> 01:06:07,925
Surprise!

1315
01:06:11,637 --> 01:06:14,937
Have you really never brought
a girl home before?

1316
01:06:15,141 --> 01:06:16,939
I brought you here.

1317
01:06:17,059 --> 01:06:20,233
I mean like a real girl. Not a friend.

1318
01:06:21,105 --> 01:06:23,107
- A real girl?
- Yeah.

1319
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,822
I guess not.

1320
01:06:25,943 --> 01:06:28,617
- Separation of church and state.
- Ah, yes.

1321
01:06:28,779 --> 01:06:32,283
Build up as many walls as possible.
That's really healthy.

1322
01:06:32,408 --> 01:06:34,502
- What, are you talking to me about walls?
- Yeah.

1323
01:06:34,618 --> 01:06:36,837
What about you and your mom?

1324
01:06:36,996 --> 01:06:39,966
You couldn't get me out of there fast
enough when she walked in on us.

1325
01:06:40,124 --> 01:06:42,252
That was for your own protection. Okay?

1326
01:06:42,334 --> 01:06:46,180
I'm just surprised she didn't try
to slip you her number or something.

1327
01:06:46,297 --> 01:06:48,470
She did. She put it in my phone.

1328
01:06:48,591 --> 01:06:50,685
- Under "MILF."
- Oh, my God.

1329
01:06:50,801 --> 01:06:53,475
It's cool, we only hooked up, like, twice.

1330
01:06:55,097 --> 01:06:57,395
I'm starting to get a mental image.

1331
01:06:57,475 --> 01:06:58,727
Well, I have a video image.

1332
01:06:58,809 --> 01:07:01,983
No. Just stop it. Just stop it.

1333
01:07:04,607 --> 01:07:06,655
Just wrong.

1334
01:07:09,987 --> 01:07:11,159
What?

1335
01:07:12,698 --> 01:07:14,996
Nothing. Just glad I met you.

1336
01:07:17,453 --> 01:07:20,502
Yeah, well, knowing you
doesn't suck either.

1337
01:07:38,349 --> 01:07:41,523
- But I thought you said...
- I know what I said.

1338
01:09:18,699 --> 01:09:19,791
God.

1339
01:09:44,683 --> 01:09:46,856
Lasorda was a good pitcher,
but he was an even better manager.

1340
01:09:46,977 --> 01:09:49,446
- Wrecking Crew?
- I wasn't saying he's not a great manager.

1341
01:09:49,521 --> 01:09:51,273
He's underappreciated as a pitcher,
that's all I'm saying.

1342
01:09:51,357 --> 01:09:52,700
We get it. Guys.

1343
01:09:52,816 --> 01:09:53,908
- Hi.
- Morning.

1344
01:09:53,984 --> 01:09:57,488
- Good morning.
- Is it always this beautiful out here?

1345
01:09:57,988 --> 01:10:00,867
Well, in between the fires and the floods,
we get about 10 good days.

1346
01:10:01,492 --> 01:10:03,745
No, no. Here. You two sit together.

1347
01:10:03,827 --> 01:10:05,204
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yeah, no, no.

1348
01:10:05,329 --> 01:10:08,003
- You don't have to do that, Dad.
- I know. I wanna look at the boat.

1349
01:10:08,082 --> 01:10:09,834
I love that boat.

1350
01:10:10,167 --> 01:10:12,010
- Here. Sorry.
- Great. Thanks.

1351
01:10:12,378 --> 01:10:13,550
Here.

1352
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:17,054
Thank you. This... Okay.

1353
01:10:18,676 --> 01:10:20,770
- Coffee, my lady?
- Yes, please.

1354
01:10:21,762 --> 01:10:23,184
Thank you.

1355
01:10:24,890 --> 01:10:27,439
- All right, man!
- Look at you!

1356
01:10:27,685 --> 01:10:30,814
- That's pretty impressive.
- Yay, Sammy!

1357
01:10:30,896 --> 01:10:32,569
All right!

1358
01:10:32,898 --> 01:10:36,698
Oh, buddy. Your shirt's leaking.
Oh, no, that's...

1359
01:10:36,777 --> 01:10:37,903
Apologies.

1360
01:10:42,616 --> 01:10:43,788
Here.

1361
01:10:48,372 --> 01:10:50,045
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1362
01:10:50,958 --> 01:10:52,380
- You?
- Yeah.

1363
01:11:04,805 --> 01:11:07,058
- See them, Sammy?
- Yeah.

1364
01:11:08,892 --> 01:11:10,894
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Yeah.

1365
01:11:11,812 --> 01:11:13,655
God, it's nice.

1366
01:11:13,731 --> 01:11:17,986
I do miss the mornings out here.
Right before it burns off, it really is beautiful.

1367
01:11:18,235 --> 01:11:19,452
I like Jamie.

1368
01:11:22,072 --> 01:11:23,915
And she's pretty, too.

1369
01:11:24,074 --> 01:11:26,748
Hey, easy, dude.
Don't you go casting a spell on her.

1370
01:11:27,077 --> 01:11:30,752
I'm a magician, not a wizard.
You and your gay Harry Potter.

1371
01:11:31,248 --> 01:11:33,797
You can't deny that going to Hogwarts
wouldn't be life-changing.

1372
01:11:34,918 --> 01:11:37,421
- I miss you.
- I miss you, too, bud.

1373
01:11:38,422 --> 01:11:41,266
Mom misses you. And so does Grandpa.

1374
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:44,432
Does he say anything?

1375
01:11:44,762 --> 01:11:47,606
No. But sometimes he calls me Dylan.

1376
01:11:50,476 --> 01:11:52,103
He said that he didn't want the job.

1377
01:11:52,186 --> 01:11:54,939
That he was just coming to New York
to explore his options.

1378
01:11:55,189 --> 01:11:56,361
What a crock of gas.

1379
01:11:57,357 --> 01:11:59,451
You fly across the country
to explore your options?

1380
01:11:59,526 --> 01:12:00,948
Please. I don't think so.

1381
01:12:01,028 --> 01:12:04,658
Exactly! Please, I knew I had him
the second he got off that plane.

1382
01:12:04,823 --> 01:12:06,040
- Oh, did you, now?
- Yeah.

1383
01:12:06,116 --> 01:12:08,710
Was that the same second you leapt
onto the baggage carousel barefoot

1384
01:12:08,786 --> 01:12:10,129
and acted out a scene from Will and Grace?

1385
01:12:10,788 --> 01:12:12,665
- She did?
- Oh, yeah, you should have seen her.

1386
01:12:12,790 --> 01:12:14,133
"Look at me, I'm goofy but cute."

1387
01:12:14,208 --> 01:12:15,755
You know what? It was all part of my plan.

1388
01:12:15,834 --> 01:12:17,006
Quite a plan.

1389
01:12:17,127 --> 01:12:18,595
Did you major in Planning
at Headhunting College?

1390
01:12:18,670 --> 01:12:21,014
- So clever.
- It's not a real college, by the way, buddy.

1391
01:12:21,131 --> 01:12:24,180
You guys bicker like
you're an old married couple.

1392
01:12:24,468 --> 01:12:25,765
Here, pick a card, my lady.

1393
01:12:25,844 --> 01:12:27,016
Okay.

1394
01:12:27,137 --> 01:12:29,105
Oh, no, not that one. The one on top.

1395
01:12:29,181 --> 01:12:31,354
- This is a good one.
- So...

1396
01:12:31,475 --> 01:12:32,647
- Yeah?
- Shuffle.

1397
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:34,733
Did you get her an engagement gift?

1398
01:12:35,145 --> 01:12:37,739
We're not engaged, Dad. We're not together.
We're just friends.

1399
01:12:37,815 --> 01:12:41,991
All right, you don't wanna label it.
I understand. But get her some jewelry.

1400
01:12:42,986 --> 01:12:44,363
The only thing your mom loves is jewelry.

1401
01:12:44,488 --> 01:12:47,992
I don't care how upset she is,
I get her jewelry, she lights right up.

1402
01:12:48,367 --> 01:12:49,539
Where is she, anyway?

1403
01:12:50,869 --> 01:12:54,043
- She's not here, Dad.
- I know, that's why I asked. Where is she?

1404
01:12:56,375 --> 01:12:58,548
- She's not coming.
- Why not?

1405
01:12:59,086 --> 01:13:01,839
She doesn't live with you any more, Pop.
You're not married.

1406
01:13:02,589 --> 01:13:05,217
- What?
- She left about 10 years ago.

1407
01:13:05,342 --> 01:13:06,434
I don't understand.

1408
01:13:06,844 --> 01:13:08,721
She divorced you, Dad.

1409
01:13:11,849 --> 01:13:13,192
- I have to call her.
- Dad, you can't.

1410
01:13:13,267 --> 01:13:14,689
Stop telling me what to do.

1411
01:13:16,061 --> 01:13:17,529
Get your...

1412
01:13:21,191 --> 01:13:22,443
Grandpa!

1413
01:13:22,693 --> 01:13:23,990
Dylan, get...

1414
01:13:24,069 --> 01:13:25,446
- You okay, Dad?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

1415
01:13:25,529 --> 01:13:27,952
- Here, let me help you up.
- No, don't. Don't!

1416
01:14:00,272 --> 01:14:01,740
Here we are.

1417
01:14:02,816 --> 01:14:05,114
This is beautiful.

1418
01:14:05,235 --> 01:14:07,988
Yeah, this is where I used to
come to think. My rooftop.

1419
01:14:08,071 --> 01:14:09,573
Okay, how high do you think that fence is?

1420
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:11,242
I'm a little over 6 foot.

1421
01:14:11,408 --> 01:14:14,662
Looks like it's about three of me.
So six times three...

1422
01:14:15,746 --> 01:14:17,419
Ninety-two feet.

1423
01:14:17,915 --> 01:14:21,294
- Ninety-two feet. That's really tall, right?
- Yeah.

1424
01:14:22,252 --> 01:14:25,756
But they don't want you to get up there,
so I guess that makes sense.

1425
01:14:25,839 --> 01:14:29,594
- Wait. Six times three...
- Oh, God, you poor kid.

1426
01:14:30,469 --> 01:14:32,312
- What's up?
- Come on.

1427
01:14:32,763 --> 01:14:34,310
What? What? Where are you going?

1428
01:14:34,932 --> 01:14:37,651
Jamie, no, no, no, no, no, wait.
They take this shit seriously, okay?

1429
01:14:37,768 --> 01:14:38,769
Look at all the cameras.

1430
01:14:38,852 --> 01:14:42,231
This is the only landmark this city has
other than the Scientology Center.

1431
01:14:42,314 --> 01:14:45,409
And if any of these cameras are hooked up
to the actual Scientology Center,

1432
01:14:45,484 --> 01:14:47,361
that was an inappropriate joke
and I apologize.

1433
01:14:47,444 --> 01:14:50,038
I believe in the freedom
of science fiction.

1434
01:14:51,531 --> 01:14:53,204
Pussy! Oh, sorry.

1435
01:14:53,283 --> 01:14:54,330
Pussy!

1436
01:14:54,701 --> 01:14:55,793
Come on!

1437
01:15:02,125 --> 01:15:04,924
- You really never been up here before?
- No.

1438
01:15:05,003 --> 01:15:07,472
I've also never transferred
heroin in my rectum,

1439
01:15:07,547 --> 01:15:09,345
'cause it's against the law.

1440
01:15:09,675 --> 01:15:13,475
You know, sometimes a simple
yes or no answer is adequate.

1441
01:15:13,637 --> 01:15:15,310
Hey, why didn't you tell me about your mom?

1442
01:15:15,806 --> 01:15:17,808
She's not worth talking about.

1443
01:15:18,475 --> 01:15:19,476
That's rough.

1444
01:15:19,810 --> 01:15:21,187
So is leaving your husband and kids.

1445
01:15:22,312 --> 01:15:24,360
Yeah, you never told me about him either.

1446
01:15:24,481 --> 01:15:26,404
You know, there's a lot of stuff
you didn't tell me.

1447
01:15:26,525 --> 01:15:28,072
I don't want your pity.

1448
01:15:29,569 --> 01:15:33,324
I can handle anything except
that look in people's eyes.

1449
01:15:35,742 --> 01:15:38,666
- That one.
- Who cares what anybody thinks?

1450
01:15:39,204 --> 01:15:42,549
He's the smartest man I've ever known.
He's the only person I'd ever go to for advice.

1451
01:15:42,666 --> 01:15:43,918
He's my dad.

1452
01:15:44,042 --> 01:15:45,464
Dylan, he's still the same man.

1453
01:15:45,544 --> 01:15:46,887
When I see the way people
look at him now...

1454
01:15:47,004 --> 01:15:50,178
It doesn't matter how people look at him.

1455
01:15:50,257 --> 01:15:51,509
All that matters is how you look at him.

1456
01:15:51,591 --> 01:15:54,435
Yeah, but he's walking around
without his pants. Everyone's staring.

1457
01:15:54,553 --> 01:15:56,146
- So what?
- It's embarrassing.

1458
01:15:56,221 --> 01:15:57,894
He needs to know that nothing has changed.

1459
01:15:58,015 --> 01:15:59,892
That he's still that same man to you.

1460
01:16:00,017 --> 01:16:02,019
Can we stop talking about this?

1461
01:16:03,562 --> 01:16:06,816
Yeah, that's really smart.
Let's just not talk about our feelings.

1462
01:16:06,898 --> 01:16:08,024
I'm trying not to.

1463
01:16:10,027 --> 01:16:13,122
Come on. Is something going on here?
You've been acting really weird.

1464
01:16:13,447 --> 01:16:15,199
- No, I haven't.
- Yeah, you have.

1465
01:16:15,782 --> 01:16:17,079
Is this about what
happened the other night?

1466
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:19,294
What, sex? That doesn't mean anything.
You know that.

1467
01:16:22,539 --> 01:16:23,586
Right.

1468
01:16:23,707 --> 01:16:25,880
- And I haven't been acting weird.
- Okay.

1469
01:16:27,544 --> 01:16:29,922
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, shit!

1470
01:16:30,088 --> 01:16:32,011
- I told you!
- Well, I'm sorry!

1471
01:16:32,090 --> 01:16:33,137
Fuck!

1472
01:16:33,216 --> 01:16:36,311
This is the LAPD. You are trespassing.
Get down from the sign.

1473
01:16:36,386 --> 01:16:37,558
We gotta jump.

1474
01:16:39,473 --> 01:16:41,896
- Dylan, jump!
- I'm frozen.

1475
01:16:41,975 --> 01:16:43,067
Come on, get down!

1476
01:16:43,143 --> 01:16:44,269
Sin this is your last warning.

1477
01:16:44,394 --> 01:16:46,567
- Use the ladder!
- I have a fear of heights!

1478
01:16:46,813 --> 01:16:51,569
And also helicopters!
They don't make sense to me!

1479
01:16:51,651 --> 01:16:53,995
What do you mean
you have a fear of heights?

1480
01:16:54,446 --> 01:16:55,868
Why would you come up here?

1481
01:16:55,947 --> 01:16:58,496
You called me a pussy!

1482
01:17:00,494 --> 01:17:03,168
A bizarre situation
this afternoon in the Southland.

1483
01:17:03,246 --> 01:17:06,796
The LAPD rescued a local man
from the Hollywood sign,

1484
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:08,968
the city's only real landmark.

1485
01:17:09,086 --> 01:17:11,259
They actually wrapped
you in a foil blanket!

1486
01:17:11,463 --> 01:17:13,010
Did you run a marathon before this?

1487
01:17:13,090 --> 01:17:14,637
- Okay. Give me...
- No!

1488
01:17:14,758 --> 01:17:17,011
- No, no. I wanna save it. I gotta save it.
- No. That's enough!

1489
01:17:17,094 --> 01:17:19,347
- Give me the remote! Shut up!
- No, I wanna watch it over and over.

1490
01:17:19,429 --> 01:17:21,022
Foil wrapper...

1491
01:17:21,098 --> 01:17:22,315
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1492
01:17:23,266 --> 01:17:25,018
It's okay, it'll be up on YouTube.

1493
01:17:26,311 --> 01:17:30,032
Hey, you're still good to take Dad that week I
have to go to DC for Sam's class trip, right?

1494
01:17:30,107 --> 01:17:33,281
- Yeah, he's gonna stay with me in New York.
- Oh, good.

1495
01:17:33,652 --> 01:17:36,371
So, when are we gonna see Jamie again?

1496
01:17:36,446 --> 01:17:37,914
I don't know.

1497
01:17:37,989 --> 01:17:40,367
What's your problem?
Did you have a fight with your girlfriend?

1498
01:17:40,450 --> 01:17:42,498
She's not my girlfriend.
Why don't you believe me?

1499
01:17:42,619 --> 01:17:44,963
I would believe you if
you didn't lie to me.

1500
01:17:45,038 --> 01:17:47,086
I saw you creeping out of her room
the other night.

1501
01:17:47,165 --> 01:17:49,213
Like you had just had sex,
if you know what I mean.

1502
01:17:49,459 --> 01:17:51,211
Yes, I know what you
mean, you just said it.

1503
01:17:51,294 --> 01:17:53,513
And how do you know
what I look like after I have...

1504
01:17:53,630 --> 01:17:56,850
I'm not talking to you about this, okay?
We're not together.

1505
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:59,519
- Dylan.
- Enough! I'm not talking about it.

1506
01:17:59,719 --> 01:18:00,971
Dylan.

1507
01:18:02,806 --> 01:18:04,228
Forgot my saw. I'll be right back.

1508
01:18:06,810 --> 01:18:09,359
I'll wait here. Don't worry about me.

1509
01:18:09,479 --> 01:18:12,653
Friends who have sex?
What are you, in college?

1510
01:18:12,732 --> 01:18:14,700
- It doesn't matter, it's over.
- Why?

1511
01:18:14,818 --> 01:18:16,491
Because we don't like each other like that.

1512
01:18:16,570 --> 01:18:19,540
Okay, you know what?
Can we just talk about this? Sit down.

1513
01:18:19,823 --> 01:18:21,245
What more are you looking for?

1514
01:18:21,324 --> 01:18:23,326
- Who says I'm looking for anything?
- Dylan.

1515
01:18:23,493 --> 01:18:26,667
- I don't know, but it's not Jamie.
- Why, because you're great together?

1516
01:18:26,997 --> 01:18:28,590
Because you're actually
friends with each other?

1517
01:18:28,665 --> 01:18:31,134
Because this is the happiest
I have ever seen you?

1518
01:18:31,209 --> 01:18:34,088
I don't know what to tell you. She's not for me.
I don't like her like that.

1519
01:18:34,171 --> 01:18:37,675
- You liked her enough to have sex with her.
- It's just physical.

1520
01:18:37,757 --> 01:18:40,636
- Like playing tennis.
- I don't even know what that means, Dylan.

1521
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:43,268
I haven't seen you this dumb
since you got that candy corn tattoo.

1522
01:18:43,388 --> 01:18:45,686
It's a lightning bolt! With extra powers!

1523
01:18:45,765 --> 01:18:47,859
Dylan, you can't name
one thing that's wrong with her.

1524
01:18:48,018 --> 01:18:51,147
I can never go out with her.
She's too fucked up.

1525
01:18:51,229 --> 01:18:53,152
Okay, she doesn't want a boyfriend.

1526
01:18:53,231 --> 01:18:54,403
She's too damaged.

1527
01:18:54,524 --> 01:18:56,572
Magnum P.l. couldn't solve
the shit going on in her head.

1528
01:18:56,693 --> 01:18:58,912
Wow. You'll say anything right now

1529
01:18:59,029 --> 01:19:00,576
not to admit that
you're perfect for each other.

1530
01:19:00,697 --> 01:19:02,574
- Why am I still having this conversation?
- Because I'm right.

1531
01:19:02,699 --> 01:19:04,372
- Good talk, Annie.
- Dylan.

1532
01:19:24,596 --> 01:19:26,644
I don't think the three-point line
would have done anything.

1533
01:19:26,723 --> 01:19:28,521
- He was taller than anyone alive.
- No, but it helped Kobe.

1534
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,068
- Kobe Bryant is incredible.
- It helped him.

1535
01:19:30,143 --> 01:19:33,522
- You're men. You like sports. You're men.
- Scored 81 points. Please.

1536
01:19:33,605 --> 01:19:35,482
Hey! We were waiting for you.

1537
01:19:35,774 --> 01:19:37,196
I actually got a call from work.

1538
01:19:37,275 --> 01:19:38,993
I have to be on a red eye tonight
back to New York.

1539
01:19:39,319 --> 01:19:40,741
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

1540
01:19:41,112 --> 01:19:43,080
- Tomorrow's the 4th.
- I know, it sucks.

1541
01:19:43,323 --> 01:19:44,620
Well, at least let me
drive you to the airport.

1542
01:19:44,741 --> 01:19:47,745
No, no. It's fine. Stay.
I already called a cab. It's out front.

1543
01:19:47,827 --> 01:19:49,875
But thank you guys for everything.

1544
01:19:49,955 --> 01:19:52,754
And thank you for letting me stay here.
It's been pretty great.

1545
01:19:56,002 --> 01:19:57,174
- Hey.
- Hey.

1546
01:19:57,254 --> 01:20:00,178
- Everything okay, buddy?
- Yeah, buddy. Everything's great.

1547
01:20:00,257 --> 01:20:01,600
I just really gotta go.

1548
01:20:01,925 --> 01:20:05,555
So, thank you again. I'm sorry I gotta go.

1549
01:20:05,637 --> 01:20:07,355
- Let Dylan drive you.
- Yeah.

1550
01:20:07,430 --> 01:20:10,274
- Do you wanna take some food to go?
- Do you want me to saw you in half?

1551
01:20:10,433 --> 01:20:13,687
You can send your bottom part to New York
and your top half can stay here.

1552
01:20:15,146 --> 01:20:18,150
Or the whole of you could stay.

1553
01:20:18,275 --> 01:20:19,993
Okay, I'm sorry. I gotta go.

1554
01:20:32,372 --> 01:20:33,794
Jamie!

1555
01:20:41,298 --> 01:20:43,847
She's gone. She hopped in the cab.

1556
01:20:51,141 --> 01:20:53,519
- We should eat. You hungry, buddy?
- Yeah.

1557
01:20:53,893 --> 01:20:56,316
Okay. Hand me your plate.

1558
01:21:26,593 --> 01:21:29,437
Hey, bro. You hungry?
'Cause I'm going to get something to eat.

1559
01:21:29,512 --> 01:21:32,516
Thanks, man.
I think I'm just gonna work through lunch.

1560
01:21:32,682 --> 01:21:37,779
A work ethic. I love it.
That is why this country is still number one.

1561
01:21:38,355 --> 01:21:42,110
Well, behind Germany and France
and Belgium and Japan and China and...

1562
01:21:42,525 --> 01:21:44,778
Thank God for Bangladesh.

1563
01:21:45,528 --> 01:21:49,032
By the way, why did you take
your door off its lovely hinges?

1564
01:21:49,115 --> 01:21:51,538
It was dumb, man.
Something I saw in a management book.

1565
01:21:51,701 --> 01:21:55,456
Oh, right, right.
Like, that's how Warren Buffett got rich.

1566
01:21:55,538 --> 01:21:57,290
He took doors off of things.

1567
01:21:57,374 --> 01:21:59,376
Hey, everybody wants a shortcut in life.

1568
01:21:59,459 --> 01:22:02,303
My guidebook is very simple.
You wanna lose weight?

1569
01:22:02,462 --> 01:22:03,634
Stop eating, fatty.

1570
01:22:03,755 --> 01:22:04,881
You wanna make money?

1571
01:22:04,964 --> 01:22:06,966
Work your ass off, lazy.

1572
01:22:07,050 --> 01:22:08,176
You wanna be happy?

1573
01:22:08,259 --> 01:22:10,478
Find someone you like and never let him go.

1574
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:13,724
Or her, if you're into
that Kind of creepy shit.

1575
01:22:26,569 --> 01:22:29,072
Hi, you've reached Jamie Rellis.
I can't pick up the phone right now

1576
01:22:29,155 --> 01:22:31,749
but please leave a message
and I'll call you back.

1577
01:22:38,915 --> 01:22:41,919
Mom, Mom, you gotta point it at the screen.
You gotta tell it where you are.

1578
01:22:42,585 --> 01:22:45,964
Fine. I'm over here pouring myself a drink.

1579
01:22:50,009 --> 01:22:53,434
Booty call.
I can take a walk around the block.

1580
01:22:53,513 --> 01:22:56,107
No, no. Nope, that's okay.

1581
01:22:56,182 --> 01:22:57,934
This is your apartment.
I don't wanna twat-block you.

1582
01:23:00,937 --> 01:23:02,780
That's Dylan, right?

1583
01:23:02,939 --> 01:23:04,737
- He seemed pretty great.
- You met him once.

1584
01:23:04,816 --> 01:23:06,659
Well, that's more than
anybody else you've dated.

1585
01:23:06,943 --> 01:23:09,947
I don't know, you think maybe I keep
my worlds apart for some crazy reason?

1586
01:23:21,124 --> 01:23:23,627
I am an asshole.

1587
01:23:24,294 --> 01:23:27,389
We're looking for someone
to lead the redesign of our entire website.

1588
01:23:27,464 --> 01:23:29,216
Someone to turn it completely upside down.

1589
01:23:29,299 --> 01:23:31,051
But you can't tell me
what company you work for?

1590
01:23:31,134 --> 01:23:33,683
For confidentiality reasons, no.

1591
01:23:33,803 --> 01:23:35,020
Can you give me a hint?

1592
01:23:35,138 --> 01:23:39,143
We may or may not be the largest seller
of purchased goods on the Internet.

1593
01:23:39,225 --> 01:23:41,569
And by 'purchased goods, â I mean books.

1594
01:23:41,978 --> 01:23:44,572
You just placed the new art director
over at GQ, right?

1595
01:23:44,647 --> 01:23:45,694
Yeah.

1596
01:23:45,815 --> 01:23:48,694
That's the type of guy we want.
Shoot, that's the guy we want.

1597
01:23:48,818 --> 01:23:49,819
Can you get him to come out to us?

1598
01:23:50,653 --> 01:23:53,247
No longer have a relationship with him.

1599
01:23:53,364 --> 01:23:56,208
- Can you get to him?
- He's still in the first year of his contract,

1600
01:23:56,326 --> 01:23:58,749
so that would be inappropriate.

1601
01:23:58,828 --> 01:24:00,922
So is paying full price
for a book at Barnes & Noble,

1602
01:24:00,997 --> 01:24:02,169
but people do dumb shit.

1603
01:24:05,835 --> 01:24:08,338
Hi, you've reached Jamie Rellis.
I can't pick up the phone right now

1604
01:24:08,421 --> 01:24:10,515
but please leave a message
and I'll call you back.

1605
01:24:10,673 --> 01:24:13,677
Wow, right to voice mail. Didn't even ring.

1606
01:24:25,939 --> 01:24:27,191
Jamie.

1607
01:24:29,108 --> 01:24:31,406
How'd you know I was up here?

1608
01:24:32,695 --> 01:24:34,538
Only place in the city
you don't get reception.

1609
01:24:34,614 --> 01:24:35,866
Right.

1610
01:24:36,032 --> 01:24:38,126
- Why are you avoiding me?
- I'm not.

1611
01:24:38,409 --> 01:24:40,377
Really? Come on, Jamie.

1612
01:24:40,537 --> 01:24:44,542
Well, Dylan, I don't know if you've heard,
but I am seriously fucked up.

1613
01:24:45,250 --> 01:24:49,221
I mean, Magnum P.I. couldn't solve
the shit going on up here.

1614
01:24:50,213 --> 01:24:52,511
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
- But I'm just gonna go

1615
01:24:52,590 --> 01:24:55,890
and try to fix the shit going on up
in my head, if that's even possible.

1616
01:24:56,553 --> 01:25:00,274
I shouldn't have said that.
I was just trying to get my sister off my back.

1617
01:25:00,390 --> 01:25:02,609
- She thought we liked each other.
- Yeah, me, too, Dylan.

1618
01:25:02,725 --> 01:25:03,726
I thought we were friends.

1619
01:25:03,810 --> 01:25:06,404
But friends don't go
talking shit about each other,

1620
01:25:06,479 --> 01:25:09,858
which must mean that you and I
were actually never friends.

1621
01:25:09,941 --> 01:25:13,366
- That all you wanted was to get in my pants.
- What?

1622
01:25:13,444 --> 01:25:15,663
You jumped at the chance
at your dad's house.

1623
01:25:15,738 --> 01:25:16,830
You cracked your neck.

1624
01:25:16,906 --> 01:25:19,034
I thought you were giving me a sign.
We talked about this.

1625
01:25:19,117 --> 01:25:20,460
Oh, my God, really?

1626
01:25:20,577 --> 01:25:22,830
You pulled my robe off.
"Oopsy." Remember?

1627
01:25:22,912 --> 01:25:25,131
Yeah. And then you snuck out of the room.

1628
01:25:25,248 --> 01:25:26,420
"Oopsy." Remember that?

1629
01:25:27,417 --> 01:25:30,421
Are you pissed off at me
because I didn't cuddle?

1630
01:25:32,255 --> 01:25:36,351
Isn't that why we started
this whole arrangement in the first place?

1631
01:25:36,509 --> 01:25:38,182
You wanted this.

1632
01:25:40,847 --> 01:25:42,440
I wanted this?

1633
01:25:43,474 --> 01:25:44,771
Just me?

1634
01:25:45,101 --> 01:25:48,401
God, you are just like every other guy.

1635
01:25:48,479 --> 01:25:51,278
The sad thing is, Dylan,
I actually thought you were different.

1636
01:25:51,357 --> 01:25:53,610
Different from what?
I'm not your boyfriend, I'm your friend.

1637
01:25:54,444 --> 01:25:56,617
Well, with friends like you,
who needs friends?

1638
01:25:59,365 --> 01:26:03,791
And thank you for ruining my mountaintop.

1639
01:26:04,662 --> 01:26:05,959
Asshole.

1640
01:26:12,879 --> 01:26:14,847
Hey, man, you can't be up here.

1641
01:26:15,715 --> 01:26:16,887
Okay.

1642
01:26:17,175 --> 01:26:19,849
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

1643
01:26:46,496 --> 01:26:48,544
Bryce, is this for me?

1644
01:26:48,831 --> 01:26:51,209
Yeah. And so is this.

1645
01:26:51,584 --> 01:26:54,178
Madison, will you many me?

1646
01:26:54,504 --> 01:26:56,427
You bet your ass, Flapjack!

1647
01:26:58,675 --> 01:27:00,928
- I love New York.
- I love you.

1648
01:27:01,678 --> 01:27:03,555
Oh, my God.
Look, the Empire State Building.

1649
01:27:03,763 --> 01:27:04,935
Wow.

1650
01:27:05,014 --> 01:27:06,607
Oh, look, the Statue of Liberty.

1651
01:27:13,940 --> 01:27:15,362
Hello, this is Jamie.

1652
01:27:17,193 --> 01:27:19,116
What do you mean they went to him directly?

1653
01:27:20,196 --> 01:27:21,698
Well, is he gonna take it?

1654
01:27:21,864 --> 01:27:24,959
No, no, no, no, no. I'll handle it.
I'll call him right now.

1655
01:27:25,034 --> 01:27:26,206
Okay.

1656
01:27:29,956 --> 01:27:31,708
Hey this is Dylan. Leave a message.

1657
01:27:40,091 --> 01:27:41,764
Excuse me. May I help you?

1658
01:27:41,968 --> 01:27:44,016
Oh, hi. Where's Dylan Harper?

1659
01:27:44,095 --> 01:27:45,722
He's at a photo shoot for the sports issue.

1660
01:27:46,222 --> 01:27:49,476
That's right. The photo shoot.
Where was that again?

1661
01:27:49,726 --> 01:27:50,818
I'm sorry. Who are you?

1662
01:27:51,561 --> 01:27:52,733
One of the models.

1663
01:27:53,438 --> 01:27:55,566
I have the perfect body for Photoshop.

1664
01:27:56,065 --> 01:27:59,660
Yeah, this gets more angular,
these get longer,

1665
01:27:59,777 --> 01:28:02,075
and this gets way more Christian.

1666
01:28:02,572 --> 01:28:04,666
So where did you say he was again?

1667
01:28:05,742 --> 01:28:09,121
Sports is the last chance we have
of bringing our world together, bro.

1668
01:28:09,287 --> 01:28:12,336
So I just wanted to shoot some photos
that speak to that,

1669
01:28:12,415 --> 01:28:14,793
to the unification of all people
through sports.

1670
01:28:14,917 --> 01:28:16,294
Okay, guys. Let's go.

1671
01:28:16,919 --> 01:28:18,091
That's it.

1672
01:28:18,629 --> 01:28:19,846
Beautiful.

1673
01:28:20,006 --> 01:28:21,724
Okay, now put your arms around each other,

1674
01:28:21,799 --> 01:28:24,143
like you like each other,
like you love each other.

1675
01:28:24,510 --> 01:28:26,763
- Too gay?
- A little bit.

1676
01:28:27,013 --> 01:28:29,141
Throw some girls in there.

1677
01:28:29,265 --> 01:28:31,609
Come on, ladies. Hop to.

1678
01:28:33,186 --> 01:28:36,486
Girls, girls. Okay, look. Just blend in.

1679
01:28:36,939 --> 01:28:39,158
Okay, let's go boy, girl, boy...

1680
01:28:39,275 --> 01:28:41,118
- Dylan.
- ...boy, boy, boy, boys.

1681
01:28:41,944 --> 01:28:43,787
- What are you doing here?
- You met for another job!

1682
01:28:43,863 --> 01:28:46,616
- What, are you gonna leave now?
- I don't know. Yeah, I took one meeting.

1683
01:28:46,699 --> 01:28:49,122
- I can't believe you.
- Come here.

1684
01:28:50,161 --> 01:28:52,255
- Is this your way of getting back at me?
- What?

1685
01:28:52,330 --> 01:28:54,458
You know that if you leave
before a year is up, I get screwed.

1686
01:28:54,707 --> 01:28:56,175
Oh, right.

1687
01:28:56,292 --> 01:28:57,509
If I did leave,

1688
01:28:57,627 --> 01:29:00,426
which I don't know yet
because all I did was take one meeting,

1689
01:29:00,505 --> 01:29:02,348
I'd write you a check for your bonus.

1690
01:29:03,633 --> 01:29:06,011
Whatever it is, I'll pay for it.
Happy now? We good?

1691
01:29:06,302 --> 01:29:08,475
- Why didn't you tell me you were looking?
- That's personal.

1692
01:29:08,554 --> 01:29:10,852
And we're not friends any more.
You made that pretty clear.

1693
01:29:12,391 --> 01:29:16,066
See, all I wanted to do
was have sex with you. Remember?

1694
01:29:16,813 --> 01:29:18,406
Pretend you were the best
friend I'd ever had.

1695
01:29:18,481 --> 01:29:20,324
Open up to you
like I've never done with anyone ever.

1696
01:29:20,650 --> 01:29:23,995
And then when the sex stopped,
invite you to LA for the weekend

1697
01:29:25,571 --> 01:29:27,039
to introduce you to my family.

1698
01:29:28,574 --> 01:29:30,997
- I'll send you a check if I take the job.
- Don't bother.

1699
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:38,088
Why don't you pick him up?

1700
01:29:38,501 --> 01:29:41,095
Yeah. Just pick him on up.

1701
01:29:41,379 --> 01:29:43,507
Oh, you little Christ figure, you!

1702
01:30:07,697 --> 01:30:10,041
- Hey, Dyl.
- Dad's coming into Newark Airport, right?

1703
01:30:10,116 --> 01:30:11,868
Yeah, he leaves at 9:00 our time.

1704
01:30:12,034 --> 01:30:14,878
9:00. So it's a five-hour flight,
three-hour time difference,

1705
01:30:14,954 --> 01:30:17,582
so he gets in at 321007

1706
01:30:17,707 --> 01:30:20,711
5:00. Be there at 5:00, Dylan.

1707
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:22,928
Right. How is Dad?

1708
01:30:24,589 --> 01:30:27,092
He's lost more often than not now.

1709
01:30:27,216 --> 01:30:30,220
But then he has these moments
of real clarity. It's hit or miss.

1710
01:30:30,303 --> 01:30:31,475
- Okay.
- How's Jamie?

1711
01:30:33,973 --> 01:30:35,566
- That's over.
- Oh, Dylan!

1712
01:30:35,725 --> 01:30:38,774
- Okay, we're done.
- Don't be an idiot, please.

1713
01:30:38,895 --> 01:30:41,239
Thank you, Annie.
I'll pick up Dad tomorrow at the airport.

1714
01:30:41,314 --> 01:30:43,066
- 32:00 sharp.
- I love you.

1715
01:30:46,736 --> 01:30:48,113
I don't know what it is.

1716
01:30:48,237 --> 01:30:50,740
I just can't get myself
to start looking for a replacement for him,

1717
01:30:50,823 --> 01:30:51,915
assuming that he leaves.

1718
01:30:51,991 --> 01:30:55,211
- Do you want some motherly love advice?
- Not really.

1719
01:30:55,286 --> 01:30:57,038
Oh, good, 'cause I don't know
how to do that.

1720
01:30:57,121 --> 01:31:00,716
What I do know is that
it's no great goddamn secret

1721
01:31:00,791 --> 01:31:03,510
you live in fear of repeating my mistakes.

1722
01:31:03,586 --> 01:31:05,680
And you're not wrong, so learn from me.

1723
01:31:05,922 --> 01:31:08,926
Do you know how many men in my life
I thought were really perfect?

1724
01:31:09,133 --> 01:31:10,259
- Eighty.
- One.

1725
01:31:10,426 --> 01:31:12,099
- Eighty-one?
- One.

1726
01:31:12,303 --> 01:31:14,772
It was your dad. Greatest man I ever met.

1727
01:31:14,847 --> 01:31:16,520
Obviously. Look at you.

1728
01:31:16,599 --> 01:31:19,819
How smart you are, how great,
how funny, how driven.

1729
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:21,279
Your vaguely Middle Eastern beauty.

1730
01:31:21,354 --> 01:31:24,107
Sure as hell didn't all come from me.

1731
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:26,534
Okay, but, seriously, Mom,

1732
01:31:26,609 --> 01:31:28,953
do you really not remember
where my dad's from?

1733
01:31:29,153 --> 01:31:30,780
Or is it like a coping mechanism?

1734
01:31:30,863 --> 01:31:32,661
- A little of both.
- Okay.

1735
01:31:32,782 --> 01:31:35,285
But I'm pretty sure he's Eurasian.

1736
01:31:36,452 --> 01:31:40,127
I mean, we all have our Prince Charming,
you just gotta know him when you see him.

1737
01:31:40,289 --> 01:31:42,792
Mom, it's Prince Charming.
You should just know.

1738
01:31:42,875 --> 01:31:46,129
Well, your Prince Charming isn't coming
to rescue you in a horse and carriage.

1739
01:31:46,212 --> 01:31:47,885
That's not who you want.

1740
01:31:47,964 --> 01:31:51,889
I mean, you're looking for a man
to be your partner.

1741
01:31:52,802 --> 01:31:54,520
To take on the world with.

1742
01:31:54,637 --> 01:31:57,390
You gotta update your fairytale, baby.

1743
01:31:58,015 --> 01:31:59,858
My Prince Charming?

1744
01:32:00,559 --> 01:32:01,902
You.

1745
01:32:02,061 --> 01:32:03,153
Mom.

1746
01:32:25,418 --> 01:32:29,013
- Hey.
- A wheelchair. Like I'm an invalid.

1747
01:32:29,171 --> 01:32:30,718
- How was the flight?
- I'm hungry.

1748
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:32,558
You know they don't serve food
in coach any more?

1749
01:32:32,675 --> 01:32:34,928
You'd think with these new planes,
they practically fly themselves,

1750
01:32:35,011 --> 01:32:37,560
they could get rid of a pilot
and use his salary for a hot lunch.

1751
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:40,103
- I know, right? Let's get you some food.
- God.

1752
01:32:40,558 --> 01:32:42,777
The engineering on these planes
is so advanced.

1753
01:32:42,852 --> 01:32:44,069
Completely computerized.

1754
01:32:44,186 --> 01:32:46,188
- It's like playing a video game.
- Exactly.

1755
01:32:46,355 --> 01:32:49,199
God. How long have we been waiting here?
It's ridiculous.

1756
01:32:49,358 --> 01:32:51,406
I'll be right back, okay?

1757
01:32:54,196 --> 01:32:56,244
Excuse me. We've been waiting a while.

1758
01:32:56,365 --> 01:32:58,038
- Harper.
- Yeah, I got you. I got you.

1759
01:32:58,117 --> 01:32:59,744
I have to seat people
in the order they came.

1760
01:32:59,869 --> 01:33:01,792
I totally understand that,
but I'm with my dad

1761
01:33:01,871 --> 01:33:03,748
- and he's not in the best shape.
- I'm sorry.

1762
01:33:03,914 --> 01:33:05,712
Is there no way we could,
like, squeeze a table?

1763
01:33:06,083 --> 01:33:08,632
No, I gotta go by the list. Sorry.

1764
01:33:12,548 --> 01:33:13,720
Dad?

1765
01:33:20,556 --> 01:33:21,728
Dad?

1766
01:33:23,059 --> 01:33:24,561
Shit. Dad?

1767
01:33:37,281 --> 01:33:38,749
You gonna join me?

1768
01:33:48,459 --> 01:33:50,086
Absolutely.

1769
01:33:54,799 --> 01:33:56,597
Excuse me, sir.
I'm sorry, you cannot do this.

1770
01:33:56,675 --> 01:33:58,894
Could I get a steak, medium, please?

1771
01:33:58,969 --> 01:34:00,937
- Sir, this is the Daily Grill.
- Make that two.

1772
01:34:10,106 --> 01:34:11,483
Dede? Dede!

1773
01:34:20,449 --> 01:34:21,621
Dad.

1774
01:34:22,118 --> 01:34:23,461
Dad.

1775
01:34:27,289 --> 01:34:28,381
Who is Dede?

1776
01:34:29,166 --> 01:34:33,467
Jesus. She's just a girl
that I met in the Navy.

1777
01:34:34,547 --> 01:34:35,969
Was...

1778
01:34:38,467 --> 01:34:40,060
She was the love of my life.

1779
01:34:41,637 --> 01:34:42,684
Okay?

1780
01:34:43,806 --> 01:34:45,149
Why didn't you tell me about her before?

1781
01:34:45,307 --> 01:34:48,151
This is not something
you discuss with your children.

1782
01:34:48,227 --> 01:34:51,106
And besides, I have you and Annie.
I have no regrets.

1783
01:34:51,188 --> 01:34:52,235
So tell me now.

1784
01:34:54,483 --> 01:34:55,860
She was the love of my life.

1785
01:34:55,985 --> 01:34:57,237
And I was too stupid to realize it,

1786
01:34:57,319 --> 01:35:00,414
and I lost her because of something
so dumb I don't even remember.

1787
01:35:01,157 --> 01:35:02,579
And I never really got over her.

1788
01:35:03,159 --> 01:35:06,914
And I think that may be
one of the reasons your mom left.

1789
01:35:08,164 --> 01:35:11,714
You know, my friends used to say that
when Dede and I looked at each other,

1790
01:35:11,834 --> 01:35:13,006
it was electric.

1791
01:35:13,085 --> 01:35:14,337
And I let her go.

1792
01:35:14,753 --> 01:35:16,096
I just let her go.

1793
01:35:16,172 --> 01:35:19,722
Because I was too damn proud
to tell her howl really felt about her.

1794
01:35:20,426 --> 01:35:23,020
I'll tell you something that I wish
I knew when I was your age.

1795
01:35:23,179 --> 01:35:25,022
And I know you've heard
a million times, "life is short."

1796
01:35:25,097 --> 01:35:28,692
But let me tell you something,
what this is teaching me

1797
01:35:28,767 --> 01:35:31,896
is that life is goddamn short
and you can't waste a minute of it.

1798
01:35:34,523 --> 01:35:36,366
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1799
01:35:40,863 --> 01:35:44,709
The girl I brought home to LA, Jamie?

1800
01:35:44,783 --> 01:35:47,457
- Yeah, what's going on with her?
- I think I messed it up.

1801
01:35:47,953 --> 01:35:49,546
- Fix it.
- She won't talk to me.

1802
01:35:49,872 --> 01:35:52,000
Maybe she'll listen. There's always a way.

1803
01:35:52,082 --> 01:35:56,758
If you think there's even a chance
that she could be it, you fix it.

1804
01:35:58,881 --> 01:36:00,133
Did Annie put you up to this?

1805
01:36:00,883 --> 01:36:02,055
Who's Annie?

1806
01:36:02,593 --> 01:36:03,765
I'm kidding.

1807
01:36:03,886 --> 01:36:06,184
What, I can't joke about this?

1808
01:36:06,263 --> 01:36:08,766
- Jesus Christ, Dad.
- I don't know what else to do.

1809
01:36:10,601 --> 01:36:11,727
Let's go.

1810
01:36:12,102 --> 01:36:14,150
You don't want to finish your steak?

1811
01:36:14,230 --> 01:36:17,109
We're eating in the goddamn airport.
I can leave the steak. Come on.

1812
01:36:17,608 --> 01:36:21,579
Yeah, hey, this is Dylan Harper from GQ.
We meta few weeks ago at the...

1813
01:36:21,654 --> 01:36:24,123
Right. Hey, can I ask you a huge favor?

1814
01:36:24,448 --> 01:36:26,917
- I am so sorry, sir.
- It's my fault.

1815
01:36:26,992 --> 01:36:28,539
- You just scared me.
- No, no. My fault. You all right?

1816
01:36:28,619 --> 01:36:30,121
- Yeah, I'm good.
- Here, let me help you with that.

1817
01:36:30,246 --> 01:36:32,840
- Thanks, man. You're really nice.
- All right. Hey, safe travels.

1818
01:36:32,915 --> 01:36:34,417
- All right, thanks, man.
- Okay, thank you.

1819
01:36:35,167 --> 01:36:39,013
You gotta be fucking kidding me.
All right, let's dance, Clowny Brown.

1820
01:36:39,171 --> 01:36:41,845
- What's your problem with me?
- I saw you at that bar with Jamie.

1821
01:36:42,091 --> 01:36:45,686
How could such an awesome girl
be with this over this?

1822
01:36:46,428 --> 01:36:49,272
I've been trying to take that little monkey
to pound-town for years.

1823
01:36:49,765 --> 01:36:51,608
- I'll tell her you say hello.
- What?

1824
01:36:51,809 --> 01:36:53,857
You missed a little. There you go.

1825
01:36:53,936 --> 01:36:55,609
Dylan! I got a cab. Come on.

1826
01:36:55,688 --> 01:36:57,110
I ever run into you again,

1827
01:36:57,189 --> 01:36:59,612
I'll crush your earlobes
and make soup stock out of them.

1828
01:36:59,775 --> 01:37:01,777
- You have a vivid imagination.
- I do!

1829
01:37:01,860 --> 01:37:04,204
- I'm gonna get in the cab now.
- I'm gonna go make soup!

1830
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:06,157
- What's the matter with her?
- I don't know.

1831
01:37:10,286 --> 01:37:13,631
God! I thought LA was bad.
This traffic is terrible.

1832
01:37:13,789 --> 01:37:15,041
Is there another way into the city?

1833
01:37:25,467 --> 01:37:27,561
I owe you big time, Tommy.

1834
01:37:27,636 --> 01:37:32,016
You'll make it up to me.
Actually, I was heading into town anyway.

1835
01:37:32,516 --> 01:37:36,817
Tonight's the Butterfly Ball.
Great place to pick up dudes.

1836
01:37:36,979 --> 01:37:39,152
- You okay, Dad?
- Are you kidding?

1837
01:37:39,315 --> 01:37:42,615
1937 Chris-Craft?
Couldn't get any better, buddy.

1838
01:37:42,693 --> 01:37:43,819
Nice.

1839
01:37:46,071 --> 01:37:48,244
Yeah. Hi, this is Dylan. We met at...

1840
01:37:48,324 --> 01:37:51,419
Right. Can I ask you a huge favor?

1841
01:37:55,914 --> 01:37:58,258
My number. Here's the remote.

1842
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:01,674
My friend Dave from across the hall, his
oven broke, so he'll be using the kitchen.

1843
01:38:01,754 --> 01:38:05,099
Your friend Dave is here using the kitchen
or watching me?

1844
01:38:05,507 --> 01:38:06,850
Go.

1845
01:38:07,009 --> 01:38:08,556
- Holy...
- What?

1846
01:38:08,677 --> 01:38:10,520
"How to wear white pants to a cookout."

1847
01:38:10,679 --> 01:38:13,774
Did you scoop the Times on this?
I smell Pulitzer.

1848
01:38:14,350 --> 01:38:15,567
All right, all right.

1849
01:38:15,684 --> 01:38:17,106
Just say hello to her for me, will you?

1850
01:38:18,103 --> 01:38:19,525
See you, Dad.

1851
01:38:20,856 --> 01:38:22,028
Thanks, man.

1852
01:38:22,399 --> 01:38:23,946
Hi, Dave from across the hall.

1853
01:38:24,026 --> 01:38:27,747
Hi, Mr. Harper. How are you?

1854
01:38:28,614 --> 01:38:30,207
And now we know why you're here.

1855
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:34,795
Mom, I'm over by the Lexington exit.
Where are you?

1856
01:38:34,870 --> 01:38:36,998
I'm standing right by the guy in the tie.

1857
01:38:37,081 --> 01:38:40,756
- There are a million guys in ties.
- So look for the guy I'm standing next to.

1858
01:38:40,876 --> 01:38:43,720
You never do what you say you're gonna do.
When am I gonna learn?

1859
01:38:43,921 --> 01:38:45,423
Just hang on, baby.

1860
01:38:50,052 --> 01:38:51,144
What?

1861
01:38:53,472 --> 01:38:55,395
I don't think I'm gonna be able
to make it after al/.

1862
01:38:55,474 --> 01:38:57,602
Something came up. Let's meet tomorrow.

1863
01:38:57,726 --> 01:39:00,821
I'll be on the stairs.
Right across from you.

1864
01:39:05,275 --> 01:39:06,743
Oh, my God.

1865
01:39:07,111 --> 01:39:08,579
Have a great night, baby.

1866
01:39:27,965 --> 01:39:29,512
What is this?

1867
01:39:29,633 --> 01:39:32,307
It's Closing Time, by the band Semisonic!

1868
01:39:32,594 --> 01:39:34,892
It's not Third Eye Blind.
Can you believe that?

1869
01:39:34,972 --> 01:39:37,771
No, no, no. Not the song. This.

1870
01:39:37,975 --> 01:39:39,977
You said you wanted your life
to be like a movie.

1871
01:39:40,936 --> 01:39:44,531
Sorry I had to use the real Grand Central
instead of the fake one.

1872
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:52,372
Listen, Jamie, I'm...

1873
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:54,621
I'm having trouble hearing you!

1874
01:39:54,700 --> 01:39:56,577
Yeah, I didn't really think this through.

1875
01:39:56,660 --> 01:39:59,004
I guess in the movies
the guy pours his heart out

1876
01:39:59,121 --> 01:40:00,498
and they put the music in later.

1877
01:40:00,664 --> 01:40:01,836
What?

1878
01:40:05,127 --> 01:40:06,299
I messed up.

1879
01:40:07,296 --> 01:40:08,798
I was scared.

1880
01:40:09,631 --> 01:40:11,349
Look at what happened
with my mom and my dad.

1881
01:40:11,467 --> 01:40:12,559
Of course I was scared.

1882
01:40:13,385 --> 01:40:14,807
So I ruined it.

1883
01:40:15,971 --> 01:40:17,769
Everything that happens in the day,

1884
01:40:17,848 --> 01:40:21,022
all I can think to myself is,
"I can't wait to tell Jamie about this."

1885
01:40:22,019 --> 01:40:25,148
When I see someone cursing,
all I picture is you blinking.

1886
01:40:25,981 --> 01:40:30,578
And when I hear a kid's been cured of
cancer, I pray it's not by that douchebag,

1887
01:40:30,652 --> 01:40:33,576
tree-hugging fucking doctor
who ran out on you.

1888
01:40:33,822 --> 01:40:38,202
I mean, cancer being cured is awesome,
but, you know, I wish someone else did it.

1889
01:40:39,077 --> 01:40:40,374
Come on.

1890
01:40:45,334 --> 01:40:47,678
Hey, I miss you.

1891
01:40:47,836 --> 01:40:49,679
Yeah, I miss you, too.

1892
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:51,848
But you're not wrong, I am damaged.

1893
01:40:52,007 --> 01:40:54,226
So am I. Who isn't?

1894
01:40:54,510 --> 01:40:56,387
That's what makes us so awesome.

1895
01:40:56,512 --> 01:40:58,185
- And our tattoos.
- Yeah.

1896
01:41:00,349 --> 01:41:02,852
- No, no, no.
- Shut up. It's not what you think.

1897
01:41:03,393 --> 01:41:05,862
Jamie, will you be my best friend again?

1898
01:41:06,897 --> 01:41:09,195
- That is so lame.
- I know.

1899
01:41:10,359 --> 01:41:11,986
That's some Prince Charming shit,
though, right?

1900
01:41:12,069 --> 01:41:13,286
- Get up.
- Okay.

1901
01:41:14,863 --> 01:41:18,083
Look, I can live without
ever having sex with you again.

1902
01:41:18,450 --> 01:41:20,293
It'd be really hard.

1903
01:41:20,744 --> 01:41:23,588
Hey, I want my best friend back,

1904
01:41:23,872 --> 01:41:25,715
because I'm in love with her.

1905
01:41:26,583 --> 01:41:29,052
- Under one condition.
- Anything.

1906
01:41:30,879 --> 01:41:32,222
Kiss me.

1907
01:41:33,799 --> 01:41:36,427
- In public? In front of all these people?
- I did not ask you to...

1908
01:41:56,071 --> 01:41:58,073
You can all go home now.

1909
01:42:04,329 --> 01:42:06,297
Okay. So...

1910
01:42:09,251 --> 01:42:11,424
- What do we do now?
- Have our first date.

1911
01:42:11,795 --> 01:42:12,921
Okay.

1912
01:42:16,091 --> 01:42:19,186
Oh, my God!
Did you get a horse and carriage?

1913
01:42:20,262 --> 01:42:22,105
Yeah, that's not for you.

1914
01:42:22,306 --> 01:42:25,355
Oh, thank God.
Horses actually scare the shit out of me.

1915
01:42:25,517 --> 01:42:26,769
- Really?
- Yeah.

1916
01:42:26,935 --> 01:42:28,187
So, where are you from?

1917
01:42:28,270 --> 01:42:30,819
- Outside of Philly, actually.
- Interesting.

1918
01:42:31,023 --> 01:42:34,618
- I'm from LA, just moved to New York.
- Interesting. Didn't really ask, but go on.

1919
01:42:34,693 --> 01:42:37,993
What? I'm excited, I'm
on a first date. So...

1920
01:42:38,322 --> 01:42:40,495
This isn't weird at all.

1921
01:42:40,616 --> 01:42:42,789
- We're okay.
- Yeah. Thank you.

1922
01:42:45,162 --> 01:42:46,789
So...

1923
01:42:49,374 --> 01:42:50,967
Yeah, fuck it.

1924
01:49:02,163 --> 01:49:05,918
Roll credits, roll credits, roll credits.
And here come the outtakes.

1925
01:49:06,334 --> 01:49:09,679
Because if the actors had
a good time making it, it must be good.

1926
01:49:09,838 --> 01:49:11,681
You bet your ass, Jason.

1927
01:49:12,257 --> 01:49:14,680
Oh, my God, I just called him Jason.

1928
01:49:14,759 --> 01:49:16,511
Look, the crew's laughing.

1929
01:49:17,512 --> 01:49:20,391
They made me do it! They made me do it.

1930
01:49:21,057 --> 01:49:22,525
It's my favorite part.

1931
01:49:23,305 --> 01:49:29,544
