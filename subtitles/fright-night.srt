and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:11,070
Defy reason.
Defy everything you know.

3
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:34,176
Welcome to Fright Night.

4
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,971
Onstage at the Hard Rock Hotel
and Casino in Las Vegas.

5
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,598
Welcome back.

6
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,768
In the northern Las Vegas suburb
of HiIIcrest BIuffs today,

7
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:46,355
a woman Ieaving a grocery store says
a man came up to her

8
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,023
and tried to bite her.

9
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,109
He was scared off
by the security guard.

10
00:01:50,185 --> 00:01:52,160
If you've seen or witnessed anything
similar...

11
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,788
Really? Really?
l'm going to take you apart.

12
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,415
You watch me.
Watch me take you apart.

13
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,125
You're done. You're done.

14
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:13,919
Nothing doing?

15
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:18,590
This thing has got no ambition.
lt's got no huevos.

16
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,927
Doris, do you want some help
with the trash?

17
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,595
l got it. Thanks.

18
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:29,101
All right. Good to see you, Char-Char.
You're getting big.

19
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,612
Hey, kid. Don't leer at the neighbours.

20
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,865
She's the one that
put the word on her butt.

21
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,992
l'm just reading it.

22
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,122
ls he ever going to
move that dumpster?

23
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,124
Mom, come on. You got to get over it.

24
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,668
Attitude.

25
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,045
You've been stressed or something.

26
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,174
Amy?

27
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,011
Amy is good.
Hasn't dumped me yet, so...

28
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,141
Getting what you want can be stressful.

29
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,561
Especially when you're not used
to getting it. More to lose.

30
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:16,398
You reading those books again?
The Power of Whatever-the-Hell?

31
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,901
Because they're definitely not working.

32
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:21,987
And neither is this bike.

33
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,656
Still tripping out over some guy's box.

34
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,491
lt's an eyesore.

35
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:30,412
l'm trying to get people to move in,
not join the legions leaving town.

36
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,497
- l like that word. "Legions."
- Hello.

37
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,041
Can l get some help here?

38
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:37,369
- When the Perrys lived there...
- When the Perrys lived there,

39
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,172
they were the greatest neighbours ever,
but they moved.

40
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,133
l thought you were happy
their house finally sold.

41
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:47,220
He's not digging a pool, so where did
all this concrete come from?

42
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,680
That's a very good question.

43
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,891
Maybe you should spy on him
some more and find out.

44
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,479
He's 13 feet from our house.
That's not spying.

45
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:59,107
lt's merely observing.

46
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:03,904
- Hi, Mrs Brewster.
- Hey, honey. Hi, girls.

47
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,447
- Hi.
- Hi.

48
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,871
- Hey, Ed called again.
- Yeah?

49
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,882
l'm tired of
making excuses for you, Charley.

50
00:06:14,966 --> 00:06:16,908
lf you don't want to talk to him,
just tell him.

51
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:19,169
Kind of defeats the purpose.

52
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,134
- Still can't get the bike started?
- No faith.

53
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,678
So you don't need a ride?

54
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:30,972
Amy!

55
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:36,186
Amy! Oh, my God.

56
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,315
- Charley?
- Yeah.

57
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:41,733
- Guess what?
- What?

58
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:45,320
- Guess what? We are on time.
- Good.

59
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,572
- You stress too much.
- No, l don't.

60
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,200
Yeah, you do.
You do your worried thing.

61
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,702
- What's my "worried thing"?
- Your worried thing.

62
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,956
l don't have a worried thing.
l never make that face.

63
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,124
All the time.

64
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:01,878
- Ladies.
- Dudes. Looking good.

65
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,174
Seriously? A mochaccino?

66
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,553
You can't ride with the girls any more.
l mean,

67
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,222
you let them brush your hair,
My Pretty Pony?

68
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,640
Chuck's secure.

69
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,184
Nice, man. Nice kicks.

70
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,987
- Puce.
- Fuck, yeah.

71
00:07:19,055 --> 00:07:21,206
l have track after school.
l'll see you later.

72
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,275
Hey, Amy, Amy.

73
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:28,738
About the prom. l was going to ask you.
l just kind of figured it was a go.

74
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:32,659
You, me, ill-fitting tuxedo.
The whole thing, you know?

75
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:36,997
No. Nobody goes to the dance
in senior year.

76
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:39,124
Okay. Yeah, l knew that.

77
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,084
- lt's so not cool.
- l know.

78
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,753
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

79
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:54,181
Did you find
a freaking genie lamp, man?

80
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:58,977
Make a sacrifice to the hot-ass gods?
How do you get that?

81
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,563
Just game, man.

82
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,690
Rock-solid game.

83
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,861
- He doesn't even have a car.
- Seriously.

84
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:10,697
- Ben Wegener?
- Here.

85
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,282
Nick Straley?

86
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,202
Nick?

87
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,663
- Courtney Frank?
- Here.

88
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:19,998
Adam Johnson?

89
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,125
Adam?

90
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,878
- Steve Danton?
- Here.

91
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,922
- Matt Hofstetler?
- Yo.

92
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:30,509
- Ellen Mclntosh?
- Here, Ms Granada.

93
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,636
Samuel Silverman?

94
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,972
Holy crap, man. How did you get that?

95
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,307
She's hard up, man.

96
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,060
Dude, l think Ed's going to talk to us.

97
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,395
Hey, can l get a minute?

98
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,731
Just the two of you? That's sweet!

99
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,776
Now he can school you
in the ways of geek-douchery.

100
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,654
Nice. Don't you have
some sluts to go fuck?

101
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,280
Actually, yeah, l do.

102
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,074
lt's important, Brewster.

103
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,456
What's up, Ed?

104
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,250
You know Adam's missing, right?

105
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,793
What do you mean, Adam's missing?

106
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:08,071
l keep trying him.
No texts, no phone calls, nothing.

107
00:09:08,073 --> 00:09:10,273
l don't know if you were
paying attention at roll call,

108
00:09:10,275 --> 00:09:11,992
but he's not the only one that's gone.

109
00:09:12,377 --> 00:09:14,586
Kids aren't coming to school.
That happens all the time.

110
00:09:14,612 --> 00:09:16,096
What do you want me to do about it?

111
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:17,665
Just meet me at his house after school.

112
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:19,251
We'll check around
and see if he's okay.

113
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,793
l can't. l'm sorry. l'm busy.

114
00:09:21,819 --> 00:09:24,437
l don't think you understand
what l'm telling you. Adam's gone.

115
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,756
Do we really have to do this here?

116
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,792
Am l supposed to not even speak
to you any more?

117
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,361
- Be quiet. Don't spaz out.
- "Don't spaz out."

118
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,864
You don't want me to spaz out?
Oh, my God! lt's so horrible!

119
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:38,368
Crossing the streams! Will high school
as we know it cease to exist?

120
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:45,208
Okay. You want me to go tell your pals
how well we really know each other?

121
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,461
The LEGO contests,
the Farscape conventions,

122
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,046
- the costumes?
- Please stop.

123
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,173
Or how about that one time
you took my Stretch Armstrong,

124
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,509
so you could tie it around your balls
and jerk off for an hour?

125
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,970
- Stop.
- Then be my backup.

126
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:02,142
Okay, fine. Adam's after school.

127
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:03,977
Don't be late.

128
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,190
l'd really like Stretch back, by the way.

129
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,490
You know what l want for dinner?

130
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,952
You realise you're eating
right now, right?

131
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,705
You just forced me to get you
a smoothie so big

132
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,373
that they named a planet after it.

133
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:30,003
lt's true. l'm insatiable.

134
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,755
You are.

135
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,928
What was that for?

136
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,264
Nothing.

137
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:46,770
l'm so sorry to take up your time.
l really appreciate your help.

138
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,148
ls my mom flirting?

139
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:55,028
Hey, Charley, l'm at Adam's house,

140
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:57,322
and it's really weird,
because you're not here.

141
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,325
Remember those videos of us
back in the day?

142
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,369
Adam, you, and l dressed in tights?

143
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:07,123
You don't want your new pals
seeing you in that, do you? All right.

144
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:13,380
So, not a pool?
What's the work you're doing?

145
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,841
Foundation problems.
l had to rip up half the basement.

146
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,135
These houses were
practically built overnight.

147
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,179
lt never surprises me
when they come apart.

148
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,473
This is the third time
this thing has broken.

149
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,767
Done. Just needed a new stem.

150
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,813
Jerry, this is my son, Charley, and his...

151
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,732
l don't know. Do we say "girlfriend"?

152
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,150
Hi, l'm Amy.

153
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,777
Hey, Jerry.

154
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,781
So, Jerry is our new neighbour
at the Perry place.

155
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,992
- And he's handy.
- No kidding.

156
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,787
l'm sorry about the mess, Charley.

157
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,957
l was just saying to your mom
l'll have the dumpster gone tomorrow.

158
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,167
lt doesn't bother me. My mom was...

159
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,378
Jerry does night construction
on the Strip.

160
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,297
You play ball.

161
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,093
l'm always looking for a pickup game.

162
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,054
Yeah, no, l do. Definitely.

163
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,056
- l do.
- lt's more of a collector thing, the shoes.

164
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:08,184
He's obsessed.
They sleep on sidewalks to get them.

165
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:12,981
- l play, though.
- lt takes a real man to wear

166
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,233
puce.

167
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,318
l like them.

168
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,866
So, l'd invite you guys inside,
but it's a mess.

169
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,994
- l've been meaning to.
- Be neighbourly.

170
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,706
A drink. Something.

171
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,551
Soon, okay?

172
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,970
Yeah, you bet.
And thank you so much for the help.

173
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,222
lt's the least l could do.

174
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,726
My God. Why did you blow him off?

175
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,480
A guy that good-looking still single?
Bad bet. He is a player.

176
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,648
Nice, Mom, breaking it down.

177
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,985
l've had enough man troubles.
l am not getting suckered again.

178
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,327
l got to go.

179
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,954
- What?
- l'll call you later. Okay?

180
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,331
- Now?
- Dinner's on.

181
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,249
- That's fine. l'll eat after.
- Charley!

182
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,668
- Are you okay?
- Okay, see you, guys.

183
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,188
Dude, where the hell have you been?

184
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,274
- You said after school.
- l meant right after. This is dusk.

185
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,276
- Do you know what that means?
- No, l have no idea.

186
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:43,112
- Let me consult my pocket dictionary.
- Nice.

187
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:49,327
Hello? Anybody home?

188
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,247
Nope.

189
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,182
This is nuts.

190
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,477
l really hate to be the one
to tell you this, but

191
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,104
that guy, your neighbour,

192
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,398
he's a vampire, man.

193
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,734
- My neighbour? Next door?
- Yeah.

194
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,112
Jerry. l just met him.

195
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,738
Okay. Jerry.

196
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,533
That is a terrible vampire name. Jerry?

197
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:32,203
l didn't name him, man.
l'm just reporting the facts.

198
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:37,709
Dude.

199
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:49,554
Hello?

200
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,057
Adam?

201
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,732
Yo. lt's Ed.

202
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,198
- Jesus.
- l feel stupid. lt's a cardboard cutout.

203
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,367
Nice.

204
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:15,288
- They're not here, dude.
- lt's not just them, okay? Listen to me.

205
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,124
l saw this thing on channel 13
where there was this lady

206
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,710
who escaped an attacker
that tried to bite her.

207
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,420
Why are you walking like that?

208
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,676
All right. Listen.

209
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:33,973
Adam and l graphed out all the attacks,
all the disappearances.

210
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,017
- Whole families, gone.
- That happens all the time.

211
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,977
Nobody lives in Vegas,
they just pass through.

212
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,604
You live in Vegas.

213
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:43,232
That's you right there in the centre,
next to his house and Perry's old place.

214
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,735
His windows
are completely blacked out.

215
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,528
Lots of people
have blacked-out windows.

216
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,572
They work on the Strip at night,
sleep during the day.

217
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,783
Which is why it's the perfect plan. lt fits!

218
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,077
What? That Jerry's a Dracula?

219
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:57,080
No. Dracula is one specific vampire.
l'm telling you...

220
00:15:57,247 --> 00:16:01,292
Dude, l know what you're telling me.
l'm making fun of you. l'm mocking you.

221
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,795
- Awesome.
- You read way too much Twilight.

222
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,255
That's fiction. This is real.

223
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,507
He's a real monster,

224
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:10,426
and he's not brooding,
or lovesick, or noble.

225
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,804
He's the fucking shark from Jaws.

226
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:16,599
He kills, he feeds, and he doesn't stop
until everybody around him is dead.

227
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,602
And l seriously am so angry
you think l read Twilight.

228
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:29,112
Ed? Ed?

229
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,031
You haven't asked him in yet,
have you?

230
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,491
Because obviously he can't get in

231
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,118
without an invitation.
l know you know that.

232
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,537
- You're on drugs, dude.
- No, well... Yeah.

233
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,288
But l thought you'd take
my word on this, man.

234
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,456
l have hard evidence at home.

235
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,166
Okay.

236
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,547
All right. Listen.
We have to stake him in his nest, okay?

237
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,842
Me and you. But not now. lt's too dark.

238
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:52,218
We should go during the day.

239
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,854
That's what l read
on Peter Vincent's website.

240
00:16:53,856 --> 00:16:55,773
- The magician?
- Yeah.

241
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,516
The magician in the bandana
and the leather pants and...

242
00:16:58,642 --> 00:16:59,809
- Yes.
- ...tattoos and...

243
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,103
Yes. He's the master of dark forces.

244
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:05,565
He studies vampire methodology.
What else do you need?

245
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,483
- Wow.
- Wow.

246
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:13,740
Can we just pretend for one minute
that you're not a complete douchebag?

247
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,491
Evil, this was fun when we were eight.

248
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,910
- Try 16.
- Whatever, man!

249
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,538
Point is l grew up.
lf you don't want to, that's fine,

250
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:23,458
but don't get an attitude because
l'd rather have a life than make shit up.

251
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:27,170
l get it. You're so cool, Brewster.

252
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,380
Go ahead and join
your Clark High early peakers,

253
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,549
- and that includes your girlfriend.
- Shut up.

254
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,260
She's undeniably doable,
yes, l will give you that,

255
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,220
but we used to make fun
of her and her friends.

256
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,264
- She's a skank. We used to make fun...
- Shut up!

257
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,775
Adam's gone and you act
like you don't give a shit!

258
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,695
What the fuck happened to you?

259
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,530
We were inseparable.

260
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,326
You know when my life
started to get better?

261
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,369
When l stopped being friends with you.

262
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,429
What a fucking asshole.

263
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:26,354
Goddamn.

264
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:32,568
- Why are you on my street, bro?
- Sorry. l'm really sorry about that.

265
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,821
You tracked your nerd juice
all the way down it.

266
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:38,241
Really? Looks like l tracked
some nerd juice on your face there.

267
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:41,244
Oh, yeah? Do l still got some?
Still there?

268
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:42,620
Okay.

269
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:46,082
Just hit me. Really,
l don't have time for this.

270
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,375
Seriously?

271
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,877
Jesus, l just gave you
a fucking invitation to hit me.

272
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,546
You just gave me an invitation...

273
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:58,177
You better run, boy!
l'm coming! You better run!

274
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,402
Unbelievable.

275
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,920
Shit!

276
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:36,632
You back the fuck up! l'm armed!
l know how to use this thing!

277
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,553
Hello! Please!
Please, somebody let me in!

278
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,972
Someone's after me right now!
Please!

279
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,600
Help me! God damn it!

280
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:59,947
Forget it, Jerry. No invitation.
You can't get in.

281
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,785
Oh, shit.

282
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:09,874
Abandoned. l thought
you did your homework.

283
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,627
You've been watching me.

284
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:18,716
l've been watching you.
lt seems fair.

285
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:02,551
Shit, shit.

286
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,513
That looked like it hurt.

287
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,859
You bit off more than you can chew.

288
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:22,029
lt's too late. l told people what you are.
You've been made!

289
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,700
And you think anyone's
actually going to believe you.

290
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:28,369
Don't play that crap,
don't play that mind shit with me.

291
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,745
l'm serious. Try me!

292
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:31,789
Okay.

293
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:40,047
You say you're glad you're different.

294
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:44,051
- Get back!
- How can you be in a place like this?

295
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:47,972
These people, even your best friend,

296
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,308
- you're nothing to him now.
- No.

297
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,436
You were born for this.

298
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,646
And you know it.

299
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,775
lt's a gift.

300
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,427
Good on his word.

301
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,682
Kid Comeback!

302
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,477
Gladiator Man!

303
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,437
Squid Man!

304
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,106
- Come at me if you dare!
- l dare!

305
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,112
What can you do now, Squid Man?

306
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,078
- Hey, you.
- ls Charley up yet?

307
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:56,791
You try. My voice seems to be
on some frequency he can't hear.

308
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,459
Charley!

309
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,711
The world is Kid Comeback's!

310
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,592
No, you're aIready dead.
No, you're aIready dead.

311
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:07,760
Coming!

312
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,138
- Eden Miller?
- Here.

313
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,182
Ed Lee?

314
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:16,769
Edward Lee?

315
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,481
- Zach Taylor?
- Here.

316
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,983
- Beth Tepper?
- Here.

317
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:34,412
Charley!

318
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:37,164
- Hey, Mrs Lee.
- What a nice surprise. Come in.

319
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,125
Rick, Charley's here.

320
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,001
- This looks great.
- Thank you.

321
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:45,506
- Look at you, so handsome!
- No. You look great.

322
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:48,843
Ed said you really sprouted up.
Look at you. How's it going?

323
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,928
Ed's going to be so sorry
he missed you.

324
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,639
- He's not here?
- No, he leaves early.

325
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:58,519
Do you mind if l run upstairs and...
There's just a book that we need.

326
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,563
Of course. Make yourself at home.

327
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:03,691
- Right up there.
- Nope, l remember.

328
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:31,927
Oh, man.

329
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:44,231
Peter Vincent.
Welcome to Fright...

330
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:56,160
Oh, Adam. Here he comes.
You see? You see what I'm saying?

331
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,622
He's a guy with a wheeIbarrow.
The horror.

332
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:02,583
Don't be a dick.
You know what I'm trying to prove.

333
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,421
There. That's his truck.

334
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,883
Fuck! Fuck me! Oh, he didn't look.

335
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,971
That's him right there, Adam.
He does not show up on the video.

336
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:19,183
He is so nailed. So nailed.

337
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,628
- Hey, guy.
- Hey.

338
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,172
Guy.

339
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:53,092
- You could really do me a solid.
- What's that?

340
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:58,264
l got a girl on her way over for a beer,
and l'm all out of beer.

341
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:01,976
lt's... Sucks.

342
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:05,854
Set me up. l'll pay you back two times.
A sixer for your mom and one for you.

343
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,107
- What do you say?
- Yeah.

344
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,234
Yeah, let me do that.

345
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:15,197
Right now. l'll go right now
and check what we got in the fridge.

346
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:16,532
Okay.

347
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,994
- Cool. Just give me a second.
- Cool.

348
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,833
Let me just see what she's got.

349
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,419
Mom's kind of a...

350
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,213
Kind of a

351
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:33,841
light domestic

352
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,760
kind of a mother.

353
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,435
Nice kitchen.

354
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,063
Good cabinet work.

355
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,316
Thanks.

356
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,154
You cool with Budweiser?

357
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,198
Yeah, that works. Yeah.

358
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,538
- Oh, shit.
- Can l help you with that?

359
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,332
No! No, no.

360
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,462
l got it.

361
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,967
l just... Yeah, l got it.

362
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,904
Sorry it's not a sixer.

363
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,965
This girl tonight, she's a handful.

364
00:27:58,927 --> 00:27:59,968
You know?

365
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,180
Women who look a certain way, they...

366
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,768
They need to be managed.

367
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,062
lt's true.

368
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,321
Your dad ducked out on you?

369
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:24,660
Your mom, she didn't exactly say, but

370
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:31,625
there's a kind of neglect.

371
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,630
Gives off a scent.

372
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,303
You don't mind my saying,
you got a lot on your shoulders for a kid.

373
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:45,973
The two of you,

374
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:47,725
alone.

375
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:53,105
And your girl, Amy, she's ripe.

376
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:58,318
l bet there's a line of guys
dying to pluck that. Your mom, too.

377
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:04,366
You don't see it. Maybe you do,
but she's putting it out.

378
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,246
lt's on you to look out for them.

379
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,292
You up for that, guy?

380
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,963
- l think l can manage.
- Good.

381
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:22,634
Because there are a lot of
bad people out there, Charley.

382
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,644
Everyone's got to look
after his own business.

383
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,237
Thanks for the beers.

384
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,084
Hey.

385
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,003
Where have you been?

386
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:00,798
You told me to meet you here
an hour ago.

387
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,551
Hello?

388
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:07,137
Hey, are you all right?

389
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:10,182
Are you all right? Everything good?

390
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,350
Yep.

391
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:15,020
- Why shouldn't it be?
- No, it should.

392
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:17,064
Did you ever read this?

393
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,150
- No.
- lt's really good.

394
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,569
lt's kind of sexy, actually, in like,

395
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:26,365
frustrated, unconsummated sort of way.

396
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:28,700
Like us, you mean.

397
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,619
Kind of makes it hotter.

398
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:43,632
- Am l boring you?
- No, l'm just tired. Sorry.

399
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,134
Okay. That's all right.
We can fix that.

400
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:52,057
Do you want to
get under the covers?

401
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,021
Right now? Really?

402
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:02,484
Yeah, why not?
We could just give it a go, and...

403
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,530
Please believe me, there is nothing
l would rather be doing right now

404
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:09,408
than getting under the covers with you.

405
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:10,534
Okay.

406
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:17,165
Charley, don't be nervous.

407
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,750
lt's okay.

408
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:23,130
l'm not nervous, l'm cool.
l'm good.

409
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,350
Did you hear that?

410
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,436
Sorry l'm late.

411
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,440
Doris. Oh, shit.

412
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,276
Shit.

413
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,428
What? He's hot,
your neighbour's a stripper.

414
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,880
They were bound to find each other.

415
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:49,364
Go-go dancer.

416
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:53,744
No. You take away two tiny pieces
of cloth, she is a stripper.

417
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,120
Rude.

418
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,374
Oh, shit! Oh, shit, he saw us!

419
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,960
Whoa! Maybe.
lt's not a big deal.

420
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:06,715
lt's a huge deal, okay? Very big deal.
He looked at us and he was pissed!

421
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,919
Okay, Charley, if you're not into this,
can you just tell me?

422
00:32:11,004 --> 00:32:12,838
Because you don't have to
do me any favours.

423
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:16,725
Amy, l'm not doing you any favours.
Of course l'm into this. Of course.

424
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,310
l don't trust that guy.

425
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,647
You're so stupid, Charley.

426
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:24,149
- l'm going.
- Come on. l'm sorry.

427
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:28,362
No, l'm going. l'm going to leave you to
look out the window at the neighbours

428
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:31,073
and have fun
with your neighbourhood watch thing!

429
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,387
Oh, shit.

430
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,061
911...

431
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,983
A woman screaming?

432
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:08,860
You bet she screamed.

433
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,864
"You bet l made her scream." Jeez.

434
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,369
- Keep it down a bit.
- Sure, absolutely.

435
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,870
Unbelievable.

436
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:13,300
Come on. Come on.

437
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:18,764
There it is.

438
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,118
Doris?

439
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:50,749
Shit.

440
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:58,024
Fuck!

441
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,821
Doris?

442
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:04,823
Doris.

443
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,033
lt's Charley.

444
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:09,703
Charley? Charley!

445
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,664
Oh, God! Get me out of here!

446
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,332
l am. l am.

447
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:21,506
Hurry!

448
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:31,850
Shit! Shit!

449
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:34,602
Oh, no, he's coming back!
He's coming back! No!

450
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:55,248
No, please.

451
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:03,757
Please don't. Please.

452
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:12,599
No, please don't. Please don't.

453
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,854
Fuck!

454
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:53,241
Oh, God!

455
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,580
Good. l got you. l got you.

456
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:03,042
That's the first thing you wear for Joe
when you get your new boobies.

457
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:06,254
I want to get breast impIants, but
my husband, he's more of an ass guy,

458
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,424
and he's very happy with my boobies,
with my minus-As.

459
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:10,837
Thank you.

460
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,841
You'll be all right.
You'll be all right.

461
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,778
Hey, you're going to be late.

462
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:43,202
The hours you keep.
lt's like living with a vampire.

463
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,204
Mom...

464
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,457
That guy Jerry, next door.

465
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:51,377
Under no circumstances
is he invited into our house,

466
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,795
all right? He's dangerous.

467
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:55,048
- l think l can handle myself.
- Mom, please, l'm serious.

468
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,884
Don't acknowledge him.
Don't talk to him,

469
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,802
and at night, please stay inside.

470
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,804
Why? Because he's dangerous?

471
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:04,807
l can't answer a million questions
right now. Will you just trust me?

472
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:09,062
Charley, stop! l'm your mom,
not some ridiculous woman.

473
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:13,483
l'm sorry, l can't do this right now.
l can't answer a million things right now.

474
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,818
l don't understand. Charley!

475
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,669
Hey.

476
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:37,340
You weren't in class.
What are you working on?

477
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:39,926
Porn.

478
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:44,263
Good. l thought
it was something creepy.

479
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,145
You okay?

480
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:55,358
- l should probably...
- Get back to your porn?

481
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,320
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

482
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:56,419
Get back, demons!

483
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:11,184
No!

484
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:18,024
Stop, stop, stop.
Stop! Cut it!

485
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:21,277
Come on! What the fuck, people?

486
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:25,531
Fire. She's supposed to be on fire,
not dribbling fucking smoke.

487
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:26,949
She keeps moving the squib.

488
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:29,410
Hey, l do not.

489
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:33,539
But Mr Fireman here almost nearly
burned off my extensions last time.

490
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:38,377
Bugger this. Look!
Get me some professionals, all right?

491
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:41,881
Mr Vincent?

492
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:44,091
Mr Vincent?
Hi, l'm from the Vegas Sun.

493
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,551
We had an appointment today.

494
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:47,762
l don't think so.
Speak to my guy.

495
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:50,389
No, we did. l'm doing that article,

496
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:51,933
"Vampires: Separating Myth
From Fact."

497
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:53,309
Do you want a quote?

498
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,479
That's a shit idea for an article.

499
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:58,564
Look, please...

500
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:03,736
Please, l need your expertise
and you're the man on this stuff, so...

501
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:05,321
l fucked her.

502
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:07,740
Filthy!

503
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,285
So, is this, what,

504
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:12,829
your first assignment or something?

505
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:14,831
Yeah.

506
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,253
l'm going to pop your cherry.

507
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:24,257
Ginger! Bring him upstairs.
You got 10 minutes.

508
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,350
Wow! This is all his stuff?

509
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:37,812
He started collecting tarots and Ouijas.
Gateway stuff.

510
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:41,357
Now scholars,
they call him for answers.

511
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:43,609
Those books, the forgotten texts,

512
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,945
the Agrippa. He's read them all.

513
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,865
No, don't touch anything.
He's PMS-y today.

514
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:51,534
Sensitive little girl.

515
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:55,454
Over there, that's haunted antiques.
Cursed stuff!

516
00:47:56,623 --> 00:48:01,377
And that's Pete's honourary degree
from LVSU.

517
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,213
But he got it off the lnternet.

518
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:09,844
Fuck!

519
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:13,556
The one and only.

520
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:19,228
- Midori me.
- Midori yourself, douchebag.

521
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,522
- Fuck you!
- Asswipe.

522
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,234
Come on in. Come on.

523
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:41,834
lt looks like pee, but l'm hooked.

524
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:45,713
- Do you want some?
- l'm good, thank you.

525
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:49,175
No? Too much for you?
Do you want a Shirley Temple?

526
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:52,178
Sit down.

527
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,183
So,

528
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:02,438
l'm the expert for your vampire thing?

529
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,650
They're all the rage.

530
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:10,446
Leather, it doesn't breathe.

531
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:13,783
Fucking rashes are fucking killing me.

532
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:20,998
Shoot.

533
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:24,377
Right. Well...

534
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:26,796
Look, l know your show...

535
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,342
l know your show is an illusion.

536
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:32,760
Meaning bullshit?

537
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:40,309
- Yeah, fair enough.
- But say l wanted to kill a vampire.

538
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:45,815
- Yeah, sorry. Go on.
- How would l go about doing that?

539
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,693
You want to know how to kill a vampire?
Seriously?

540
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,820
Yeah, kill a vampire.

541
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:53,322
Well, let's think.

542
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:57,326
You got fire, beheading.

543
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:02,832
You can make him
a big garlicky omelette.

544
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,876
Or go traditional.
Stake through the heart.

545
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:11,674
Cool. So that stuff really works?

546
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,844
Well, maybe not the omelette.

547
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:18,222
How the fuck should l know?

548
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:25,563
l don't know. You have all this stuff,

549
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:26,731
and you

550
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:30,651
are "Peter Vincent: Vampire..."

551
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,155
- l don't know. l'm not sure.
- l read books.

552
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:39,285
You think l'm hanging out with Dracula?
And the Easter bunny? Fuck off.

553
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,874
l'm sorry, but l have
a personal interest in this.

554
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,418
l think one of them got my friend.

555
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,546
What? "One of them,"
meaning a vampire?

556
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:53,424
Yeah. Jerry. He lives next door to me.

557
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,844
Jerry? Jerry the vampire?

558
00:50:57,179 --> 00:51:00,473
Do you think l don't know
how this sounds?

559
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:05,227
Two days ago l would have laughed
in my face, but it's really happening.

560
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:07,772
l am so far down the rabbit hole.

561
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:12,902
l was in his house, or his lair,
or whatever, and l got these pictures.

562
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:15,237
- lf you just look at them.
- Okay. Get out.

563
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:17,740
- No, please.
- You're a nut job. Ginger!

564
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:20,242
l'm not! l know what l saw.

565
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:22,286
No, you don't. lllusion, remember?

566
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:24,171
People see
what they want to see. This is...

567
00:51:24,173 --> 00:51:26,365
You don't collect this stuff.
You don't have all this stuff

568
00:51:26,367 --> 00:51:28,868
if you don't believe, and l promise you,
l can take you to him.

569
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,711
l can show you
what you've been waiting for...

570
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:33,422
What, in Clark County,
Nevada? Ginger!

571
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,257
That's a hotbed of supernatural activity.

572
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:37,718
lt is, though. lt's genius.

573
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:41,063
lt's a transient population. People
work all night, they sleep all day!

574
00:51:41,148 --> 00:51:42,781
Get this loser out of my sight, please.

575
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:44,475
- Stop!
- Whoa!

576
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:47,812
He got my friend already!
l am not crazy.

577
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:52,024
l'm not. l don't want to know this shit.

578
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:53,818
Please, just look at these pictures.

579
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:57,321
Get the fuck out of my house!

580
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:00,783
Time to go, doll. Come on.

581
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:24,765
Dude, is that Charley?
What the fuck is he doing?

582
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:28,185
lt's paranoia.

583
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:32,022
Once l thought l was being chased
by carrots with machetes.

584
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:35,776
- l know!
- Whatever, man.

585
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:37,903
You guys are both ruining my high.

586
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:42,783
Oh, shit! All right,
ditch the weed. l'm cool.

587
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:51,959
- Hey, guy.
- Yeah?

588
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,922
- Fuck...
- Oh, fuck.

589
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:22,489
Hey.

590
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:24,116
- Hey.
- Hey.

591
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:30,164
The whole house looks like that show.
Dark Shadows.

592
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:34,501
Yeah. lt's a gag for Amy.

593
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,503
Long story.

594
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:40,507
Don't, Mom, don't!
Don't open it!

595
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:47,097
How did you get in here?

596
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:48,849
- lt was unlocked.
- Oh, my God.

597
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:51,268
Mom, please, l told you to lock the door!

598
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:52,394
Okay!

599
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:56,232
You are flipping out.
You're acting all weird.

600
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:58,108
You're blowing everything off.

601
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:00,903
ls that a stake?

602
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:05,532
No. Maybe.

603
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,369
Look.

604
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:13,499
Even if you are losing it,
you do not get to blow me off.

605
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:16,293
You don't go from something
to nothing overnight.

606
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:21,298
You're not nothing to me, Charley,
so whatever is happening,

607
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:26,011
l would like you to talk to me,
to tell me what is going on.

608
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:29,890
Oh, man. Amy, look...

609
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,228
l need you to just
forget about me, okay?

610
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:37,231
l'm not going to let you get hurt.
l'm sorry.

611
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:39,358
What? How?
How am l going to get hurt?

612
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:47,408
- Stay there.
- l got it.

613
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:50,077
No! Don't answer it.
Please don't answer it.

614
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:52,037
This is ridiculous, Charley.

615
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:53,789
Jane, it's Jerry from next door.

616
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:56,375
Don't answer the door.

617
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:58,419
This is my house.
l will answer the door if l want to.

618
00:54:58,586 --> 00:54:59,628
But, Mom!

619
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:01,422
Jane, l need to talk to you.

620
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:05,467
Just hold on!

621
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:08,178
Now. Your son is harassing me.

622
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:10,222
- Charley, what is going on?
- Listen to me.

623
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:11,974
Whatever he says,
he's going to try to slip...

624
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,767
Jane, he broke into my house.

625
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:15,060
ls that true?

626
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:18,981
l'd rather not take this to the authorities,
but l will. l have no choice.

627
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:21,191
He's sick! He's deluded.

628
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,112
Please.

629
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:30,159
Go get the authorities!

630
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,022
- Shit!
- What?

631
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:05,486
Wow. What is he doing?

632
00:56:05,488 --> 00:56:07,447
l don't know, but whatever it is,
it's not good.

633
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:15,537
We're all right as long as we stay inside

634
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:17,998
because obviously
he can't get in without an invitation.

635
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:22,878
- Like a vampire.
- Yeah, really, like a vampire.

636
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:26,156
This is the joke for Amy, right?

637
00:56:26,241 --> 00:56:28,217
l can't believe
you got Jerry to go along with it.

638
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:29,385
Take this.

639
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:31,804
Okay.

640
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,223
Vampire protection.

641
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:35,891
l don't think this is funny.

642
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:40,521
Shit.

643
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:43,065
Hey.

644
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:46,402
What the fuck is he doing to my yard?

645
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:10,509
What's that?

646
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:35,117
l don't need an invitation
if there's no house.

647
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:36,577
Come on. Come on!

648
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:41,123
Get in! l'll drive.

649
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:48,130
Jesus Christ, Charley,
what the hell is going on?

650
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:52,050
Mom, just go!
Just gun it! Just go!

651
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,525
- ls everybody okay?
- Are you all right?

652
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:09,735
Nobody's hurt?

653
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:14,573
Look out!

654
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:19,495
Are you all right?
Amy, are you okay? You okay?

655
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:21,997
- Jesus!
- Mom, keep driving!

656
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:23,207
What the hell is going on?

657
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:27,002
This is seriously not okay, Charley!
Who the fuck is this guy?

658
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:29,004
Mom, l told you, he's a fucking vampire!

659
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,715
- Enough with the vampires!
- Really!

660
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:35,427
Let's just calm down.
l'm going to call the police.

661
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:39,223
- l don't have any service.
- l do. No.

662
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:42,518
l hate the fucking desert!
Now l have a psycho next door.

663
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:48,565
Oh, shit. Charley, is this him?
Who is this?

664
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:53,237
Oh, man. Damn it.

665
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,072
- Oh, my God.
- No.

666
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:56,949
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no.

667
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:00,661
God! What the fuck!

668
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:03,914
- What is he doing?
- Charley, he's coming around the side.

669
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:05,707
Keep going. Keep going.

670
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:07,709
Jesus Christ.

671
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:09,545
Shit. Look out!

672
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:13,715
What does he want?

673
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:26,687
- Oh, no. What do l do?
- Hit him.

674
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:28,313
- What?
- Hit him.

675
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:30,983
- Mom, just hit him!
- Charley, no!

676
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:33,235
Just fucking hit him!

677
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,198
- Don't stop.
- Holy shit!

678
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:40,367
- Just drive. Don't stop!
- Oh, my God.

679
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:52,754
- Do you see him?
- No.

680
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:58,760
- Did l kill him?
- Hopefully.

681
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:13,275
Mom.

682
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:16,778
Oh, God.

683
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:24,077
No! That's his fucked-up vampire hand.
Now do you believe me?

684
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:26,371
Shit!

685
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:28,123
Keep driving, Mom!

686
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,630
Oh, my God!

687
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:37,382
Charley, fucking kick him!

688
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:39,259
Shit!

689
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:43,013
Get away from me!

690
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,145
- Where is he?
- l don't know.

691
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:03,116
- Where is he? Where did he go?
- Stay in the car.

692
01:01:08,122 --> 01:01:09,414
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

693
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:11,625
No! Stay in the car!

694
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:13,919
You stop in the middle of the road,
you got a taillight out.

695
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:47,411
No, Charley!

696
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,291
Hey!

697
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:55,043
Charley!

698
01:02:14,522 --> 01:02:15,564
Hey.

699
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:19,443
Please go. lt'll be all right.
Go. Take her and go!

700
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,445
Amy, take her and go!

701
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:23,780
Catch you later.

702
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:28,535
l repel you with the power
of Christ the Lord.

703
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:31,413
Do you? Really?

704
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,502
That's a mighty big cross
you got there, Charley.

705
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:40,922
The question is,
do you have faith?

706
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:42,758
Get back!

707
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:47,429
Not the cross.
Not the cross, Charley.

708
01:02:51,058 --> 01:02:52,601
Come here.

709
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,985
You ever get a stake
in the chest, Charley?

710
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,906
l have. lt hurts.

711
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:07,949
But they missed the heart.

712
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:10,494
lt's right here, Charley.

713
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,330
Easy measurement.

714
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:15,832
You shouldn't have been so nosy.

715
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,055
- Mom!
- Mrs Brewster!

716
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:31,640
Her head.

717
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:36,728
- You got her?
- Yeah.

718
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:54,621
- Charley...
- Hang on!

719
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:34,411
Good show tonight, right, babycakes?

720
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:37,372
You were late again
on "The Devil's Torture Chamber."

721
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:39,457
l have something for you. Look.

722
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:44,713
You were early again in the bedroom.

723
01:04:44,797 --> 01:04:45,922
Fuck you!

724
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:48,884
l will fuck myself.
Someone's got to do it.

725
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:29,799
We won't be up all night.

726
01:05:30,843 --> 01:05:32,844
Honestly, it's really not a party.

727
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:36,598
Sit tight. We might have
a few more questions for you.

728
01:05:36,807 --> 01:05:38,266
- Okay.
- Mom?

729
01:05:39,685 --> 01:05:41,519
l love you. Bye.

730
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:49,361
They only asked a couple of questions.
We should be okay.

731
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:52,447
l don't know. l think maybe you
should've said something to the police.

732
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:56,993
Like what? "This vampire moved in,
borrowed a six-pack of Bud,

733
01:05:57,328 --> 01:06:00,538
"ate a stripper and blew up our house
because we wouldn't invite him inside."

734
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:05,043
Last time l called the cops,
they nearly all went to Chili's together.

735
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:08,880
Okay.

736
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:14,803
This is my fault.

737
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:18,515
You didn't make any of it happen.

738
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:22,477
Ed came to me,
and l turned my back on him.

739
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:25,397
How were you supposed
to believe him?

740
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:27,565
l mean, he begged me.

741
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:29,985
l mean, he really...

742
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:32,988
And he was my best friend.

743
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:38,034
l know, but, Charley,
people, they change.

744
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:40,578
Yeah, and l just changed into a dick.

745
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:43,206
l figured my dweeb past

746
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:46,001
wasn't really going to be
very popular with the ladies, so l...

747
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:49,671
Are you trying to say this is my fault?

748
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:57,095
l just really wanted you to like me,
that's all.

749
01:06:58,347 --> 01:06:59,597
Charley,

750
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:02,934
l knew you were a dweeb.

751
01:07:03,936 --> 01:07:08,356
Do you think l wanted
some dude like Mark? Or Ben?

752
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:09,524
No.

753
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:13,611
l like you. Because you're different.

754
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:19,451
lt didn't hurt that your skin cleared up.

755
01:07:20,911 --> 01:07:22,037
Thanks.

756
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,711
- Hello?
- l can help you.

757
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:31,796
My place in one hour.

758
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:35,258
We're going to see the Peter Vincent?

759
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:39,262
lt's underwhelming, believe me,
but he's what we've got.

760
01:07:40,264 --> 01:07:42,140
Mom's very religious.

761
01:07:49,273 --> 01:07:51,274
l'll tell you what l know, but that's it.

762
01:07:52,151 --> 01:07:53,151
Right?

763
01:07:53,986 --> 01:07:58,656
Don't expect me to join
your little Scooby gang. Sit down.

764
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:01,993
Whatever you got, l'll take it.

765
01:08:04,955 --> 01:08:06,581
That insignia you showed me.

766
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:11,169
lt's a species that originated
in the Mediterranean.

767
01:08:12,129 --> 01:08:15,006
They nest in the earth.
And they kill slowly.

768
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:18,343
They keep their victims alive for days.

769
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:21,262
Snackers.

770
01:08:22,014 --> 01:08:24,933
And they turn everyone?
They change them into...

771
01:08:25,017 --> 01:08:26,184
Yeah, l got it.

772
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:29,270
They're tribal by nature.
He could be trying to turn them all.

773
01:08:30,022 --> 01:08:31,356
Replenish his ranks.

774
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:33,858
How do we kill these guys?
This tribe.

775
01:08:34,026 --> 01:08:36,277
You two? You don't.

776
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:41,950
lt's a strong breed.
You're going to need an army.

777
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:46,871
Hang on. Sorry. Sorry.

778
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:51,376
- Hello!
- Mr Vincent?

779
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:53,711
- Yes!
- You have a deIivery.

780
01:08:53,879 --> 01:08:55,296
All right. Send him up.

781
01:08:56,006 --> 01:08:57,382
Ginger, we've got a delivery!

782
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:01,344
l'm watching my programme!
You get it!

783
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:04,639
You're TiVo-ing it, you lazy cow!
Come on!

784
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:11,187
Shit. Douchebag.

785
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:13,815
Hi, doll.

786
01:09:15,025 --> 01:09:19,154
eBay. l order things late at night
when l've had a few cocktails...

787
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:21,156
So, yeah, some nice stuff.

788
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:23,158
Wait a minute.
You get deliveries this late?

789
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:24,367
Yeah.

790
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:29,372
No. l don't know.

791
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:32,834
Oh, shit. No. You said
that guy could come in. That's a...

792
01:09:32,918 --> 01:09:34,586
An invitation, airhead.

793
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:38,089
Hey, Mr Vincent, package for you.

794
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:40,091
Fuck!

795
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:42,093
One second, guys. Business call.

796
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:45,263
Hello. Oh, yeah.

797
01:09:45,389 --> 01:09:49,267
No, l'm looking at them right now.
Yeah, come on up.

798
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:52,437
He's actually quite modern.

799
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:55,398
Jerry dispensed
with all that "master" stuff.

800
01:09:55,733 --> 01:09:58,067
Ed, if you have a problem,
just keep it with me, okay?

801
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:02,113
Oh, do l got a problem.
You let him get to me.

802
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:04,782
You let him turn me into this.

803
01:10:08,787 --> 01:10:10,079
Stay away, demon.

804
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:12,040
ls that itsy-bitsy little sticky for me?

805
01:10:12,124 --> 01:10:13,958
lt's a crucifixion nail.
lt's lethal to you.

806
01:10:14,126 --> 01:10:17,086
Yeah. That's old school. Nice!

807
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:19,964
You're going to have to get
pretty close to use that thing, though.

808
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:28,056
Oh, no, you don't.

809
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:29,224
Come on! Let's go!

810
01:10:35,272 --> 01:10:36,814
Holy shit!

811
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:39,776
You took my arm!

812
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:43,279
Are you enjoying your panic room,
master of darkness?

813
01:10:43,447 --> 01:10:45,823
God, you are such a pussy. l love it!

814
01:10:46,784 --> 01:10:47,825
Come on!

815
01:10:51,163 --> 01:10:52,163
Oh, my God.

816
01:10:53,832 --> 01:10:56,292
- Oh, my God.
- Amy, listen to me.

817
01:10:56,794 --> 01:10:59,796
There's more than one way out,
and there's a million things to fight with.

818
01:10:59,838 --> 01:11:01,631
We're going to be okay. All right?

819
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:03,841
- Yeah.
- Trust me. Come on.

820
01:11:07,137 --> 01:11:08,179
Come on!

821
01:11:11,475 --> 01:11:12,684
Damn it.

822
01:11:14,311 --> 01:11:16,688
Give it up, Chuck.

823
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:21,150
lf you hadn't turned out
to be such a dick,

824
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:23,278
l might have tricked you out.

825
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:25,655
We could have rocked
this evil shit together!

826
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:28,866
Sign in, please.

827
01:11:29,493 --> 01:11:33,329
Sign in, all right?
Hey! l'm talking to you.

828
01:11:34,832 --> 01:11:36,291
l need you to sign in.
No exceptions...

829
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:52,849
l expected more of a fight
from you, Brewster.

830
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:56,019
Girl's made you lazy in the head.

831
01:11:57,354 --> 01:11:58,855
Pussy will do that.

832
01:12:01,066 --> 01:12:03,693
l can hear you breathing.

833
01:12:05,237 --> 01:12:07,488
lt's really fucking cool.

834
01:12:10,075 --> 01:12:12,035
l can feel you.

835
01:12:13,203 --> 01:12:14,871
l can taste you.

836
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:17,832
You're so...

837
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:22,670
Fuck!

838
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:24,380
Come on!

839
01:12:27,426 --> 01:12:29,177
Not so fast, Chuck.

840
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:35,099
We got some catching up to do,
my friend.

841
01:12:35,893 --> 01:12:38,936
Amy, go. Amy, please go!

842
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:50,239
lt's just you and me now, buddy.
Mano a mano.

843
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:52,116
Let's do this.

844
01:12:56,288 --> 01:12:58,081
Nice weapon there, Squid Boy.

845
01:12:58,457 --> 01:12:59,499
Ed...

846
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:01,417
Not going to do you much good, though,

847
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:04,253
because l'm a goddamn
killing machine.

848
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:18,810
Come on. lt's like you're not even trying.

849
01:13:47,131 --> 01:13:48,673
l'm so glad you're here.

850
01:14:09,194 --> 01:14:10,319
Werewolves.

851
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:17,869
Vampires.

852
01:14:40,392 --> 01:14:42,894
Bone is a motherfucker, Chuckles.

853
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:46,230
lt's hard to cut.

854
01:14:52,696 --> 01:14:53,946
ls this weird for you?

855
01:14:54,072 --> 01:14:56,032
Because l'm feeling
really homo right about now.

856
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:03,206
Fuck!

857
01:15:13,592 --> 01:15:15,259
Bimbo's got some juice.

858
01:15:25,437 --> 01:15:26,437
Jerry's here.

859
01:15:30,609 --> 01:15:32,109
Do it, Charley.

860
01:15:34,321 --> 01:15:36,781
Charley, do it now!

861
01:15:49,127 --> 01:15:51,462
lt's okay, Charley. lt's okay.

862
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:05,351
Come on. l found the stairs.
We have to go. Come on.

863
01:16:07,145 --> 01:16:09,145
Come on.

864
01:16:43,223 --> 01:16:45,891
Wait. He can't kill us, not in here.

865
01:16:46,018 --> 01:16:49,478
Really? Look around. Do you think
any of these people are going to notice?

866
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:52,315
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, God.

867
01:17:09,374 --> 01:17:11,709
It's tequiIa mad T-shirts!

868
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:23,929
- Amy!
- Charley!

869
01:17:25,057 --> 01:17:26,657
Amy!

870
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:42,907
Charley!

871
01:17:43,575 --> 01:17:44,617
Amy!

872
01:17:47,245 --> 01:17:49,080
Now that is what l'm talking about!

873
01:17:49,247 --> 01:17:51,415
Can you help me? Please?

874
01:17:56,254 --> 01:17:58,214
Charley's going to come.
He's gonna find me.

875
01:17:58,256 --> 01:17:59,590
l'm counting on it.

876
01:18:00,967 --> 01:18:04,095
You'll see. You just need a taste.

877
01:18:09,267 --> 01:18:10,559
lt could be like a dream.

878
01:18:21,571 --> 01:18:22,613
Amy!

879
01:18:23,615 --> 01:18:25,707
- How did you get in here?
- Listen, man! Listen to me!

880
01:18:25,709 --> 01:18:28,452
He's dangerous. You have to help me.
That guy's going to kill her.

881
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:31,122
Yeah, she looks to be liking it, then.

882
01:18:31,248 --> 01:18:33,290
No, man. Listen, you don't understand!

883
01:18:43,802 --> 01:18:44,802
Attagirl.

884
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:51,475
- lD, then you can...
- l don't have lD! There's no time!

885
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:53,978
Amy! Amy!

886
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:09,076
Amy! No! No!

887
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:13,247
No! Amy!

888
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:33,851
Shit! How did you get in here?

889
01:19:34,186 --> 01:19:37,521
Security is a little lax since everybody
got their throat torn out.

890
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:39,440
You, too? Has he turned you?

891
01:19:40,692 --> 01:19:42,359
Check your monitor, man.

892
01:19:49,326 --> 01:19:52,870
l don't know if Amy's alive
or dead or turned, but he got her.

893
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:57,458
l'm going to end him,
or he's going to end me.

894
01:19:57,542 --> 01:19:59,877
That's how it's going to be,
and you're gonna come with me.

895
01:20:04,841 --> 01:20:07,301
Don't you understand this yet?
There will be no fighting.

896
01:20:07,385 --> 01:20:09,637
There will only be surviving.

897
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:12,223
- Maybe.
- Really?

898
01:20:12,225 --> 01:20:13,884
You think if you live and we all die,

899
01:20:13,892 --> 01:20:15,559
you'll be able to
get us out of your head?

900
01:20:16,394 --> 01:20:19,647
No, l know l won't.
l never could after the first time.

901
01:20:21,191 --> 01:20:22,733
So l told myself l made it up.

902
01:20:24,361 --> 01:20:28,322
l was a kid. Figured it was easier
to believe in monsters.

903
01:20:30,742 --> 01:20:31,867
Made what up?

904
01:20:34,871 --> 01:20:37,414
The vampire that killed my parents,

905
01:20:38,416 --> 01:20:39,708
but not me.

906
01:20:41,419 --> 01:20:44,171
You think l collected all this stuff
because it was bitching?

907
01:20:44,881 --> 01:20:47,842
Come with me. We'll go in at dawn.
He's got to rest some time.

908
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:53,597
The only reason l survived the last time
is because l had the sense to hide.

909
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:57,601
lf you want to be a dead hero,
good for you. l'm out.

910
01:20:59,771 --> 01:21:02,773
You think l'm a coward.
l'm not. l'm a realist.

911
01:21:04,609 --> 01:21:06,569
So you just bail on people.

912
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:11,115
Hey, l get it.
My dad was like that.

913
01:21:11,283 --> 01:21:14,618
But l don't want to live till tomorrow
if you're the kind of man l'm going to be.

914
01:21:20,625 --> 01:21:22,459
Hang on. Wait.

915
01:21:26,464 --> 01:21:27,715
Blessed by Saint Michael.

916
01:21:29,968 --> 01:21:33,721
You kill your vampire with this, it's
supposed to change his victims back.

917
01:21:37,475 --> 01:21:39,143
Maybe you can still save your girlfriend.

918
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:42,479
lf it's for real.

919
01:21:44,649 --> 01:21:45,983
You got a plan?

920
01:21:46,968 --> 01:21:48,669
There's no guarantee he'll be sleeping.

921
01:21:48,671 --> 01:21:50,839
To stake him, you got to get close.

922
01:21:54,659 --> 01:21:55,659
Torch him.

923
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:59,455
A vampire on fire is not thinking clearly.

924
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:04,835
lf he's on fire, how do l get
close enough to stake him?

925
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:12,968
Fuck.

926
01:22:53,677 --> 01:22:55,052
l'm going to kill a vampire.

927
01:22:56,513 --> 01:22:58,055
Good for you.

928
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:51,442
Amy! Amy!

929
01:23:52,944 --> 01:23:55,279
- Amy! Amy!
- Charley!

930
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:57,948
- You all right?
- Hey. Yeah.

931
01:23:58,116 --> 01:24:00,117
- Hang on. l'm going to get you out.
- Hurry.

932
01:24:04,873 --> 01:24:06,582
Shit. Shit.

933
01:24:09,294 --> 01:24:10,878
Amy! Amy?

934
01:24:13,089 --> 01:24:15,799
- Fuck!
- Sorry.

935
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:20,429
l guess l don't want to be
a man like me, either.

936
01:24:25,435 --> 01:24:26,643
Let's kill something.

937
01:24:29,814 --> 01:24:31,774
Floor trap. l use them all the time.

938
01:24:32,467 --> 01:24:33,917
What do you think is down there?

939
01:24:34,652 --> 01:24:36,044
There's only one way to find out.

940
01:24:36,821 --> 01:24:38,489
You're going down?

941
01:24:38,656 --> 01:24:42,326
See that? Like a great date.
You get me drunk, l'll try anything.

942
01:25:04,432 --> 01:25:06,517
Peter. Peter.

943
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:25,369
Oh, shit.
l may not be drunk enough for this.

944
01:25:31,876 --> 01:25:33,210
After you.

945
01:26:11,249 --> 01:26:12,291
Help!

946
01:26:17,714 --> 01:26:19,423
You know this is a trap, right?

947
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:21,633
l'm counting on it.

948
01:26:49,662 --> 01:26:50,746
Fuck!

949
01:27:03,593 --> 01:27:04,843
She's all yours.

950
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:11,475
Look at you, all grown up.

951
01:27:13,811 --> 01:27:15,479
Welcome to Fright Night,

952
01:27:17,815 --> 01:27:19,274
for real!

953
01:27:26,032 --> 01:27:27,366
Oh, fuck.

954
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:33,038
You've got your mother's eyes.

955
01:27:36,793 --> 01:27:38,377
And your father's aim.

956
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:42,297
Better.

957
01:27:43,174 --> 01:27:44,216
Fuck!

958
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:48,262
Amy!

959
01:28:12,870 --> 01:28:14,037
Really?

960
01:28:17,041 --> 01:28:18,542
A pebble? That's it?

961
01:28:24,716 --> 01:28:26,466
Oh, shit.

962
01:28:46,362 --> 01:28:47,487
Fuck!

963
01:28:50,533 --> 01:28:53,618
You know you should have
saved me, Charley.

964
01:28:54,579 --> 01:28:57,289
There's still time. All right?

965
01:29:04,839 --> 01:29:07,257
He's inside me now.

966
01:29:26,527 --> 01:29:27,944
Fucking eBay!

967
01:29:32,241 --> 01:29:34,409
l'll be the best you ever had.

968
01:29:34,535 --> 01:29:37,454
The only you ever had.

969
01:29:39,832 --> 01:29:44,252
Charley, we could be together forever.

970
01:30:02,397 --> 01:30:03,480
Shit!

971
01:30:21,624 --> 01:30:23,625
- You missed.
- l know.

972
01:30:55,283 --> 01:30:57,325
- How you holding up?
- Oh, fucking great.

973
01:30:59,328 --> 01:31:01,663
- Mark?
- You're dead now, asshole.

974
01:31:07,503 --> 01:31:08,795
What were you thinking, Charley?

975
01:31:09,505 --> 01:31:13,842
That you were just going to walk in here
with your little crossbow

976
01:31:13,968 --> 01:31:16,970
and put to bed 400 years of survival?

977
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:19,681
No, Charley. Not likely.

978
01:31:21,601 --> 01:31:23,226
You smell that?

979
01:31:24,896 --> 01:31:26,188
lt's your fear.

980
01:31:29,734 --> 01:31:30,984
lt's intoxicating.

981
01:31:31,861 --> 01:31:35,989
lt's a very specific scent, Charley.

982
01:31:48,711 --> 01:31:50,754
Amy's scent,

983
01:31:52,006 --> 01:31:54,841
now that was exquisite.

984
01:31:56,052 --> 01:31:59,513
lt's all gone now, Charley.

985
01:32:02,683 --> 01:32:04,476
She's something, isn't she?

986
01:32:06,062 --> 01:32:08,730
l have to thank you
for bringing her to me.

987
01:32:10,107 --> 01:32:13,026
Well, she makes me feel young again.

988
01:32:14,987 --> 01:32:16,154
l'm smoking.

989
01:32:16,489 --> 01:32:18,490
Yeah, you're turning.

990
01:32:20,034 --> 01:32:21,701
You can't stay there forever, Charley.

991
01:32:22,703 --> 01:32:25,664
The sun's got to go down,
but we can wait.

992
01:32:37,843 --> 01:32:39,010
That's rough.

993
01:33:05,955 --> 01:33:07,080
Got a light?

994
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:16,965
That's your plan?

995
01:33:18,843 --> 01:33:20,760
Actually, it's your plan.

996
01:33:27,226 --> 01:33:28,268
Fuck.

997
01:34:23,699 --> 01:34:25,033
Fuck you!

998
01:34:35,544 --> 01:34:37,921
Charley! ln the heart!

999
01:35:30,141 --> 01:35:32,100
Charley? Charley, come on.

1000
01:35:32,226 --> 01:35:34,018
Come on, Charley!

1001
01:35:34,186 --> 01:35:36,563
Charley, come on.
Come on, come on.

1002
01:35:36,689 --> 01:35:38,022
Wake up. Wake up.

1003
01:35:39,108 --> 01:35:40,942
Come on, you little prick.

1004
01:35:42,528 --> 01:35:43,570
Charley!

1005
01:35:57,460 --> 01:36:01,254
Hey.

1006
01:36:03,382 --> 01:36:04,549
You okay?

1007
01:36:06,427 --> 01:36:07,510
Yeah.

1008
01:36:09,138 --> 01:36:10,263
Are you?

1009
01:36:14,185 --> 01:36:15,518
Yeah, l'm all right.

1010
01:36:19,398 --> 01:36:20,523
You little shit.

1011
01:36:21,859 --> 01:36:25,153
Next time you're going to use my plan,
give me a heads-up first.

1012
01:36:34,371 --> 01:36:35,789
That was a fucked-up night.

1013
01:36:57,394 --> 01:36:58,478
Are you sure?

1014
01:37:00,356 --> 01:37:01,397
Yeah.

1015
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:10,031
One second.

1016
01:37:12,326 --> 01:37:13,451
Hello?

1017
01:37:13,786 --> 01:37:16,162
lt's me. Just checking in.
What are you up to?

1018
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,085
Nothing, nothing.

1019
01:37:22,087 --> 01:37:24,080

- Just did a little shopping

1020
01:37:24,082 --> 01:37:25,958
- for the new house.
- Shopping? Nice.

1021
01:37:26,048 --> 01:37:29,551
Something actually just came up,
and l have to go.

1022
01:37:29,885 --> 01:37:30,927
You okay?

1023
01:37:31,053 --> 01:37:32,846

Good. Monster free is good.

1026
01:37:37,810 --> 01:37:38,852
Okay, bye.

1027

1028

1032

lt's all yours.
Don't do anything l wouldn't do.

1033
01:37:58,831 --> 01:38:00,290
That doesn't narrow it down.

1034
01:38:00,416 --> 01:38:03,418
There's, like, mini golf and sushi.
Carry on!

1035
