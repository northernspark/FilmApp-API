kind of stayed the same size

really work too much more.

161
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,918
with the wrong thread count.

162
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,257
That's how fucked up
in the head he is.

163
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,660
But I mean,
his signature, his MO,

164
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:07,728
is burning people alive.

165
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,559
That's how you knew
Lomatic was there.

166
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:11,123
♪♪

167
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,515
(knocking)

168
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,011
Why, hello there.

169
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:33,579
Hi.

170
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,053
Got your pizza right here.

171
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:36,115
Thank you.

172
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,623
How much I owe you?

173
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:41,358
Uh, it comes out to $15
and 35 minutes with me.

174
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:44,924
What?

175
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,163
Here's a 20.

176
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,170
(sighing)

177
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:07,480
How much longer you gonna
let me go on here, seriously?

178
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,220
You only walked three blocks.

179
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:12,429
Yeah, well, why didn't you walk
the three blocks then?

180
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,624
And now I'm sitting here
subtracting money off my tip

181
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,496
and you standing there
with your hand out.

182
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,596
You know what... Whatever.

183
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:18,966
Fine... You keep it.

184
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:24,741
You sure you don't need
any help with that?

185
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:26,276
Cut it up for you?

186
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,334
Serve it to you on a plate?

187
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,177
Maybe feed it to you
like the queen of England?

188
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,580
Pizza's finally here, baby?

189
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:33,906
- Yeah.
- Good.

190
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,683
'Cause I am starving.

191
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,383
Hey.

192
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:42,114
Oh...

193
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,761
So I take it you two
don't like any sausage

194
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:47,923
on your pizza, huh?

195
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,255
Ew.

196
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,323
Wait, wait, wait.

197
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,904
I was always infatuated
with you guys.

198
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,600
I always wondered how often
do you, uh, clean the bean?

199
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,131
What?

200
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:00,232
You know.

201
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:01,367
Massage the vage.

202
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:04,041
What are you talking about?

203
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:05,738
You know.

204
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:07,206
Tickle the twat.

205
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:09,976
Goddamn!

206
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:11,310
(school bell ringing)

207
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:15,089
Aren't you here at an odd time?

208
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:16,588
That's Gia, my little sister.

209
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,060
When our dad died,
I kind of took over

210
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,460
the role model position.

211
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,327
My mom was barely home,
working to pay the bills.

212
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,196
That's the life of a flight
attendant for you.

213
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:24,529
So I pretty much raised her.

214
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,729
Well, me and rated-R
television that is.

215
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:31,002
She's got quite a mouth on her,
but she means everything to me.

216
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:32,770
Are you ever not
in detention, huh?

217
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:33,970
Even on the last day?

218
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,376
I'm still waiting for the day
you come out of school

219
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:36,474
with the rest of the kids.

220
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:37,843
It's not my fault.

221
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:39,780
It's that bitch of
a teacher Miss Barkley.

222
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:40,840
Watch it.

223
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:43,573
She's mean and her boobs sag all
the way down to her stomach.

224
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,089
You can't talk like
that about people.

225
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,784
That's why you keep getting
detention in the first place.

226
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:47,847
Sorry, Anthoni.

227
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,521
Well, at least you finished
the year with good grades.

228
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,926
High five for that.

229
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:56,256
You know, Tony's Pizzeria
is only three blocks away.

230
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:58,531
So that's an extra
three blocks I get to spend

231
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,468
with my obnoxious little
kid sister.

232
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:03,095
Shut up.

233
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,163
You shut up.

234
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,270
- You shut up.
- Big mouth.

235
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,368
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

236
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,036
(horn honking)

237
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:13,548
Anyway, I gotta tell you
about this last delivery, man.

238
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:14,607
Straight lesbians, man.

239
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,487
Man: Hold on a second, though.

240
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,887
You talking about those real
good-looking lesbians?

241
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:21,820
Are you talking about the ones
that wear the fitted hats

242
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,189
and the Champion hoodies?

243
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,490
No, I'm talking about the
good-looking lesbians, man.

244
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:27,553
I'm talking about the ones
where the two

245
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,997
are walking in the street
and you see them together...

246
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,056
Hey!

247
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:31,490
Stop fucking around.

248
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:34,131
I got the last two
deliveries for the day.

249
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,867
Now, which one of you two
procrastinating degenerates

250
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:39,907
is taking this one?

251
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:42,169
(with Italian accent) Hey... Ho.

252
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:43,713
Imma take this one,
okay, my friend?

253
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:46,409
I'm the best fucking pizza
delivery guy you got over here.

254
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:47,974
You see that picture... Huh?

255
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,884
I'm not employee of the month
for no fucking reason.

256
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:53,822
You gimme the pizzas
and I go get your money.

257
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,223
Hey... stop with that
Italian mafia shit.

258
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:58,517
You know who you sound like?

259
00:11:58,584 --> 00:11:59,722
You sound like Scarface.

260
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:01,162
(imitating Scarface)
Okay, I reloaded!

261
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,494
Tony: Go home after this.

262
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,795
I'm closing shop and I
don't want to see

263
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,802
your ugly mug here again today.

264
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,026
Okay?

265
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:08,094
Okay... Relax.

266
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,132
I deliver the pizzas now.

267
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:11,197
Oh my God.

268
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,933
Now you just
sound Chinese, man.

269
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:14,909
- Taking Gia home today?
- Yeah, I'm gonna take her home.

270
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,071
I'll see you later.

271
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,910
Yeah, Uncle Ronnie!

272
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:27,884
Don't you think that's the last
thing you should be eating?

273
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,620
Such a little prick mouth.

274
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,388
(chatter)

275
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,311
boy: Yo, Anthoni...
Let me get a slice.

276
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:41,770
You ain't getting
no slice, little man.

277
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:42,897
- Get out of here.
- Come on...

278
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:43,997
I'll give you my
sister's phone number.

279
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,736
I don't want your sister's
phone number... Get out of here.

280
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:46,868
- Hook a brother up... come on.
- I'm not hookin' you

281
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:47,933
up with nothin',

282
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,775
but I will bust your
ass at ball right now.

283
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:57,916
You ready... You ready?

284
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:59,888
You can't do nothing.

285
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,167
That's enough ball for you.

286
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:12,702
I'm outta here.

287
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:20,669
(music playing)

288
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:45,457
What's up, mamacita?

289
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,234
Hey, what's up, papicito?

290
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,261
Ain't nothing.

291
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,966
When you gonna let me
come over, huh?

292
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,237
So you can be like
♪Oh Anthoni keep spanking me♪

293
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,677
♪From the back

294
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:57,111

295
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,170
Yo, Anthoni.

296
00:13:58,571 --> 00:13:59,572
You holler at my girl?

297
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:01,242
What the fuck... Again, man?

298
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:02,980
(tires screeching)

299
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:11,116
(knocking)

300
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,251
Oh man.

301
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:14,053
Finally.

302
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,121
I been waiting
forever for this.

303
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:18,090
My God.

304
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:19,934
Total comes to $14.

305
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,300
Oh, okay.

306
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:27,608
Hey, man... Let me ask
you a question.

307
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,272
You ever call somebody, like
on the third or fourth ring,

308
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,077
you forgot who you
were calling?

309
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:34,674
But you gotta figure that
shit out because if you don't,

310
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,741
you look rude, right?

311
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,151
'Cause you called them.

312
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,285
Yeah, that's happened to me.

313
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,082
$14, man.

314
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:44,718
Hold on, let me get the money.

315
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,289
Hey, man, let me ask
you something.

316
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,459
You ever see a cockroach
on the floor, right?

317
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,922
You go to the next room to get
that bug spray, you come back,

318
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,598
that fucking thing is gone!

319
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,709
Hey, that's happened to me too.

320
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:02,968
Hold up, this
ain't enough money.

321
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,071
Hey, man... Look.

322
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,359

What level of comfort
does it have to be?

646
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:13,358
An eight.

647
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:14,525
Good.

648
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:18,769
Don't you come back here with
anything less than an eight.

649
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:28,717
There was only one man that
I could think of

650
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:30,480
that could hook
me up that I trusted,

651
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:33,147
so I had to go visit my boy
Kyle at his new spot.

652
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:35,452
We used to chill all the time
till he moved in with his girl

653
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,856
who's got him pussywhipped
to a level of

654
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:38,257
jump-how-high kind of shit.

655
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:40,452
It's real funny because Kyle,

656
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,088
he used to be a real
gangster-type dude.

657
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:43,655
Always strapped
and robbing people.

658
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:45,291
He did a three-year bid,
got out,

659
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:48,701
met this Valley girl that
flipped him like a pancake.

660
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:50,396
I never seen anything like it.

661
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:52,304
It's amazing what some
pussy can do to a man.

662
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:04,509
What's up, Kyle?

663
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,045
Anthoni.

664
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:08,921
What's going on, brother?

665
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,548
I been better.

666
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:13,188
- How you been, man?
- Me?

667
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:14,457
Oh man, I'm good.

668
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:15,520
I'm really good.

669
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:20,896
You know, Rose got me
doing a job at tech support.

670
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,468
It pays all right, you know.

671
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:25,439
But I'm staying out of trouble.

672
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:28,807
No, baby, I'm the one that
keeps you out of trouble, right?

673
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:30,140
Yes... Yes you do.

674
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:31,544
Don't you forget that.

675
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:33,204
Anthoni: That's Rosemary.

676
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:37,612
We call her Rose even though
this bitch is far from a flower.

677
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:39,154
She never really liked me.

678
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,087
I guess it's 'cause I
never really liked her either.

679
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:42,886
Kept telling Kyle to
man up, you know?

680
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:44,722
Put the bitch in
place every now and then.

681
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:46,386
Shit, I wouldn't be surprised
if Kyle told her

682
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:47,896
every time I did, you know.

683
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:49,989
"Well, Anthoni said I should
be washing the dishes

684
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:51,727
"all the time..." but whatever.

685

Hey, Anthoni.

686

What's up, Rose?

687
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,770
You want to, uh,
give us a minute?

688
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,167
Sure.

689
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:05,742
Thanks.

690
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:15,988
Um, I heard what happened
to Ronnie.

691
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,458
That's some fucked-up shit.

692
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,921
That's actually why I'm here.

693
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:23,488
I need you to hook me up
with some heavy artillery.

694
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:24,555
For what?

695
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:30,570
- I'm gonna kill Lomatic.

Are you crazy, man?

698
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:38,244
You're gonna need a tank and a
fucking SWAT team to kill him.

699
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:41,183
Man, I heard he killed
some guy for getting him

700
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,582
the wrong shoe insert.

701
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:45,310
The guy got him the gels
and he wanted the memory foam

702
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:47,378
or some shit like that, man.

703
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,823
Guess he wasn't
trying to be gellin'.

Don't get me wrong.

I want him dead just
as much as you do, man,

707

but there's only so much
people like us can do.

Plus, I ain't touched

made me watch helplessly

713
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:21,183
while gasoline was dripping
down my fucking face?

714
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,554
Do you have any idea
what that feels like, Kyle?

How you doing?

Well, Anthoni, AKA
somebody worth waiting for,

Well, it's a pleasure,
but I don't want to waste

so, in that case,

give me your number

And what makes you think

986
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:43,037
rm going to give you
my number anyway?

987
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:44,436
Well, let's not exaggerate.

988
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:45,869
It was more like
two minutes ago.

989
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:47,408
But, uh, I don't know.

990
00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:50,536
I walked by, I saw you, you
saw me, we linked eyes.

991
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,706
You know, we had this crazy
instinctive attraction going on.

992

You know, everything
moved in slow motion.

993
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:57,415
So instead of leaving it up
to you to come initiate

994
00:52:57,474 --> 00:52:58,748
the conversation, I set it off

995
00:52:58,808 --> 00:53:00,649
so you should kind of
be thanking me right now.

01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:00,984
I met him at an
Alcoholic Anonymous meeting.

1128
01:03:01,043 --> 01:03:02,420
Not that I had a problem.

1129
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:04,116
I just went there
'cause the women were easy.

1130
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:05,716
Beat going to the club any day.

1131
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,352
I could never
chill too long with Hippy,

1132
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:09,953
'cause he had the attention span
of a short little baby midget.

1133
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:11,657
I mean, ADD to the max.

1134
01:03:11,721 --> 01:03:13,029
Couldn't even have a normal
conversation

1135
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:15,626
without him drifting
off 30 seconds into it,

1136
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:16,863
but I had no choice.

1137
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:18,496
And I needed a place to stay.

1138
01:03:18,561 --> 01:03:20,302
(knocking)

1139
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:34,980
Anthoni: Hippy, yo,
what's up, man?

1140
01:03:35,044 --> 01:03:36,614
Yo, you know Jamal and Pinky.

1141
01:03:36,679 --> 01:03:37,680
Lomatic's goons.

1142
01:03:38,047 --> 01:03:39,048
They found me...
They found where I lived.

1143
01:03:39,115 --> 01:03:40,150
They busted in my door.

1144
01:03:40,216 --> 01:03:41,752
They were shooting at me.

1145
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,297
I had to jump out of my
fucking window, man.

1146
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:44,353
That's crazy, man.

1147
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:46,389

1148
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:48,291
Tangerine?

1149
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:51,137
What... Why are you offering
me tangerines right now?

1150
01:03:51,194 --> 01:03:52,195
Antioxidants, man.

1151
01:03:53,729 --> 01:03:55,936
It helps relieve the stress.

1152
01:03:59,902 --> 01:04:01,210
All right, give me one.

1153
01:04:03,773 --> 01:04:06,447
Man, you won't believe the shit
I just went through, Hippy.

1154
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:09,513
I jumped from the fire
escape onto the street.

1155
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:14,127
I'm running as fast as I can,
Pinky's fucking fast as hell.

1156
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:15,856
I jumped over a fence.

1157
01:04:15,952 --> 01:04:17,522
You know what I ended up doing?

1158
01:04:17,587 --> 01:04:21,797
I ended up jumping off of a roof
on top of a fucking train, man.

1159
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:24,429
On top of a train... Am I shot?

1160
01:04:24,493 --> 01:04:26,200
Am I bleeding somewhere...
I think I'm bleeding, man.

1161
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:27,570
They must have shot
me somewhere.

1162
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:28,631
Am I bleeding?

No, you look good,

It's that bitch Layla.

1167
01:04:43,779 --> 01:04:45,417
She set me up, man.

1168

I got caught slipping.

1169
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:50,021
Yo, you don't have no seeds
in your tangerine?

1170

What'd you just ask me?

You don't have no seeds.

1173

I have like, five already.

1174
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,573
I'm not even halfway done.

1175
01:05:06,636 --> 01:05:09,640
I'm over here telling you
about this life-changing event

1176
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:13,110
and you're asking me about some
fucking tangerine seeds?

1177
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:17,017
I just don't understand
how you had no seeds in yours.

Not even one... And mine...

You're gonna ask me about some
fucking fruit right now?

1182
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:35,371
You didn't swallow
them, did you?

1183
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:36,774
Did you swallow them?

1184
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:38,134
Yeah, HiPPY-

1185
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:40,313
Maybe I swallowed them.
Maybe I juggled them.

1186
01:05:40,369 --> 01:05:41,849
I don't know, maybe
I'm thinking about

got fucking killed.

Oh no, bro.

1189
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:46,110
You shouldn't have
swallowed them.

1190

It's real bad for your stomach.

He was the block wise man.

Anything going
down in the neighborhood,

1203

he would know three days
prior to it happening.

1204
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:14,008
He was like
the anchorman of the hood.

1205

Only thing is that he couldn't
speak a lick of English.

Look at him.

He can't even get his
wallet out of his pocket.

He probably had to lie on his
back just to put them on.

1212

He probably went
