{483}{588}CALVIN: Gus Delario--|the invisible man is Gus.
{588}{622}He´s one of those guys...
{622}{689}who you feel like|you know them really well...
{689}{739}but when|you think about it...
{739}{793}you don´t really know them|at all. you know what I mean?
{793}{839}And. you know. obviously...
{839}{889}you look at his track record|of all the movies he´s done--
{889}{947}He´s been very successful.|Almost every actor in town...
{947}{1046}wants to work in. you know.|one of Gus´s movies.
{1098}{1164}FRANCESCA: I´ve done|some mean things in my life.
{1164}{1288}Yeah. And sometimes.|the--ahem. ahem--
{1288}{1343}the worst part is|is that sometimes...
{1343}{1388}it doesn´t bother me.
{1388}{1436}I just say. well.|yeah. this is mean.
{1436}{1504}I wanted to be mean.|and I was mean.
{1504}{1547}Period.
{1599}{1673}LEE: Well. I have to be|somewhat judgmental...
{1673}{1732}because of what I do.|you know...
{1732}{1779}so I don´t think|that it´s such a bad thing...
{1779}{1827}to be judgmental.
{1827}{1925}I think that´s|how you get through life.
{1925}{1971}You have to assess things...
{1971}{2063}and people do it|about you all the time...
{2063}{2137}and that´s life.|and it´s too bad.
{2190}{2255}CARL: I think there is|no amount of money...
{2255}{2301}I could have been paid--
{2301}{2352}there is no deal|that I could have made...
{2352}{2454}that she would not have felt|that I had been too passive...
{2454}{2523}and that--I think that...
{2523}{2590}her opinion of me|on that level...
{2590}{2676}was formed before|the movie was ever sold.
{2676}{2751}I think it has nothing to do|with the movie. frankly.
{2804}{2867}ARTHUR: It´s frightening.|It´s monstrous.
{2867}{2927}It´s evil|to not have feelings.
{2927}{2993}So I spoke to Carl about it.|and we discussed it...
{2993}{3046}and we went immediately...
{3046}{3084}to the most monstrous|character...
{3084}{3124}we could think of in history--
{3124}{3158}you know. Hitler himself.
{3212}{3252}LINDA: Yeah. they´re always|trying to set me up...
{3252}{3293}Lee and Carl. They--
{3293}{3346}Well. they never have|introduced me to anyone...
{3346}{3413}but they always talk about|how I should be dating.
{3413}{3463}But they´re|trying to set me up now...
{3463}{3576}with this producer friend|of theirs--a guy named Gus.
{3576}{3675}Uh... we´ll see.|I don ´t think...
{3675}{3757}a film producer´s going to go|for me. but I don ´t know.

{6772}{6852}Excellent. Thank you.|Thank you for having me.
{6852}{6919}-Sure.|-Mind if we get started?
{6919}{6987}So, I play his partner.
{6987}{7021}An equal partner?
{7021}{7100}No, l´m his flunky...
{7100}{7144}if that´s what you want to hear.
{7144}{7180}Is that what you want to write?
{7180}{7223}Is that what|you want me to write?
{7223}{7299}No.|No, you can write „sidekick.“
{7299}{7334}That´s fine.
{7334}{7394}See, the thing is,|l´ve done a lot of TV.
{7394}{7459}He´s an established star,||a big star.
{7459}{7524}I figure it doesn´t make me|any less talented.
{7524}{7600}So, no,||I don´t have a problem with it.
{7600}{7656}Look, if l´m going to make|the leap to the big screen...
{7656}{7710}I expect to work for it.
{7710}{7760}Don´t that make sense?
{7760}{7801}Don´t you think|most black actors...
{7801}{7849}expect to have to work|to make that leap?
{7849}{7916}It doesn´t seem to happen|as often with white actors.
{7916}{7969}-Jesus.|-Don´t you find that the case?
{7969}{7998}A couple of movies...
{7998}{8060}1 5, 20 million dollar paychecks,|magazine covers.
{8060}{8100}OK, is this the kind of story|you want to write?
{8100}{8160}We can go there.
{8160}{8212}Trust me, l´ve got plenty|of opinions on the subject.

{9962}{10023}where I can´t continue|in this marriage.
{10023}{10080}I´m writing because|I can´t take any more...
{10080}{10142}emotional confrontations|about it.
{10142}{10219}I´m out of ideas.|and I want to make a change.
{10219}{10277}When I get home tonight.|we can discuss...
{10277}{10327}the practical issues|of how to separate.

{11036}{11095}Did you have|bad dreams last night?
{11095}{11150}LEE: No.
{11150}{11194}Well, I did.
{11194}{11250}Well, I had a weird dream.
{11287}{11337}I dreamt that my job...
{11337}{11433}was that every day|I would go into work...
{11433}{11559}and narrate a documentary|about some guy´s life...
{11559}{11653}and go home from work|and have dinner...
{11653}{11718}and go to bed and go back|to work in the morning.
{11718}{11879}It´s like|I have no effect on anyone.
{11976}{12038}So. what´s on for today?
{12038}{12090}More bloodshed.
{12131}{12227}God.|How do you stand it?
{12270}{12362}(Sighs) Hey, listen, don´t|forget to make the brownies...

{12754}{12813}is in any kind|of long-term relationship...
{12813}{12851}with anybody they´ve met|on the internet...
{12851}{12939}but the short-term stuff|have been pretty exciting.
{12939}{13012}I don´t know what|I´m gonna do when I meet her.
{13012}{13113}She thinks I´m twenty-two|years old. and I´m not.
{13113}{13225}I´m not a painter.|although I´d like to paint.
{13225}{13285}So. it could be anything.
{13285}{13356}I mean. the imagination|could take you anywhere.
{13356}{13430}I find that|really. really exciting.
{13430}{13521}And it´s one of those places|where I can lie.
{13567}{13672}LINDA: I´m happy with|meeting men on the computer...
{13672}{13722}on the internet.|in the chat rooms.
{13722}{13795}And. you know.|people disappoint...
{13795}{13862}and these people|don ´t so much. so...
{13862}{13919}I really connected|with somebody.
{13919}{13974}So--and he´s a painter...
{13974}{14049}and. you know. gosh...
{14049}{14130}five years from now. I´d like|to be living there with him.
{14130}{14225}I´ve told him|I´m a massage therapist...
{14225}{14277}and I didn´t lie.
{14277}{14331}Um...
{14375}{14431}I lied a little about my age--
{14431}{14481}just a little--|because he´s so young.
{14481}{14573}(Laughs) So. I just knocked|a few years off of that.
{15155}{15261}CAL VIN: She said.|“No. baby. you´re bored...
{15261}{15340}“but why are you|taking that out on us?“
{15340}{15422}(Chuckles)|It was that kind of thing.
{15422}{15501}It just--you know,|everything clicked...
{15539}{15570}for me.
{15621}{15695}(Click)|Oh. Sorry.
{15766}{15815}You transcribe those yourself?
{15815}{15878}Someone at work.
{15878}{15942}-Like an intern?|-Mm-hmm.
{15942}{15996}Male or female?
{15996}{16033}What do you think?
{16115}{16145}Male.
{16186}{16277}(Laughs)|Yeah. So, which is it?
{16277}{16372}And don´t tell me|you´re not gonna say.
{16372}{16403}Male.
{16403}{16453}-Ah.|-Mm-hmm.
{16453}{16503}Do you want to know|if he´s straight?
{16503}{16575}Oh, no, I know he´s straight.
{16575}{16614}(Cell phone ringing)
{16614}{16663}Oh, shit.
{16663}{16713}Yeah, l´m coming, l´m coming.

{17101}{17151}Hey, Frank!
{17226}{17288}CARL: I´ll tell you--|I´ll tell you what it´s like.
{17288}{17351}OK. you know.|I work at this magazine.
{17351}{17420}This magazine is great.|It´s very good.
{17420}{17469}It has very high standards.|I think.
{17469}{17517}I think they can do|really good work.
{17517}{17570}But I think the guy|who runs the thing...
{17570}{17618}is just not very smart.
{17618}{17668}I mean. you know.|this is between us...
{17668}{17718}but I just don ´t think|he´s very smart.
{17718}{17768}I think his instincts|are all wrong...
{17768}{17874}and I think|he´s. you know. the big butt.
{17874}{17965}LEE: Yeah. you know.|I´ve lost my temper in traffic.
{17965}{18022}I have. I´ve lost my temper.
{18022}{18072}I wouldn´t call it road rage...
{18072}{18173}but I have gotten pissed|driving...
{18173}{18256}because people. you know...
{18256}{18339}they drive cars|that are ridiculous--
{18339}{18453}you know. wrong for them.
{18513}{18551}(Car door opens)
{18551}{18600}(Car beeping)
{18735}{18782}I don ´t really like my job.
{18782}{18841}I´ve thought about|doing something else.
{18841}{18885}I like the money.
{18885}{18938}I don´t even|like that that much.
{18938}{18993}I could get a betterjob.
{19030}{19093}LINDA: Lee is ambitious|and smart and beautiful...
{19093}{19140}and she always has been|all of those things...
{19140}{19189}and she´s always done|really well. you know?
{19189}{19253}So. maybe she is|completely in control.
{19412}{19464}(Razor buzzing)
{19511}{19545}-Hey.|-Hey.
{19545}{19582}-Coffee.|-Herr director.
{19582}{19634}-How are you?|-What´s up, man?
{19634}{19722}Rehearsing something|for ten days sucks.
{19722}{19790}And I know how tough it´s been.
{19790}{19839}Oh. no. no. no.|Listen. Iisten...
{19839}{19881}I think I know|where you´re going. man.
{19881}{19919}First of all,||I got to apologize.
{19919}{19963}I know l´ve been|all over the map...
{19963}{20029}and that´s my process,|and l´ve kind of been crazy.
{20029}{20075}Listen, I really feel bad|about what I said...
{20075}{20125}to your friend.|I know he´s Jewish...
{20125}{20180}and I went way too far|with that whole oven thing.
{20180}{20212}But believe me,||I was going over...
{20212}{20266}some of my anger management|stuff last night...
{20266}{20316}and I really feel like|I had another breakthrough.
{20316}{20348}That´s great. That´s great.
{20348}{20390}But I just--oh, I felt so bad.
{20390}{20440}You know what,||Carl and I wrote this for you.
{20440}{20520}You are our Hitler.|Don´t you ever forget that, OK?
{20520}{20558}That means a lot,||but I know this is...
{20558}{20605}your and Carl´s vision--|I mean, you wrote this.
{20605}{20714}But, yeah, it´s funny,|I was talking to Tom Sizemore...
{20714}{20802}and he was saying the only way|to learn how to act is to act.
{20802}{20842}-Right. Yes.|-And I know you´re concerned...
{20842}{20877}because I haven´t really|memorized anything...
{20877}{20906}and l´ve been|all over the place...
{20906}{20993}but believe me, on the day--|well, you know, tonight--
{20993}{21034}yeah, I really think|it´s gonna be salty.
{21034}{21063}You´re gonna be OK.
{21063}{21104}I just want to make sure|you´re all right.
{21104}{21136}-l´m good.|-OK. All right.
{21136}{21180}-See you later.|-Oh, hey. Um...

{21493}{21579}LINDA:|Well. no. not married.
{21579}{21629}This guy that I was seeing...
{21629}{21735}This guy Tom that I was seeing|last year at this time...
{21735}{21818}said when he broke up with me.|he said he was...
{21818}{21870}getting back together|with an ex-girlfriend...
{21870}{21917}but I don ´t know|if that´s true or not.
{21917}{21966}I heard he´s--|I heard it´s not true.
{21966}{22017}But that´s what he said|at the time.

{22051}{22098}-l´m OK, how are you?|-Good, good.
{22155}{22188}It´s funny.

{22700}{22770}No. I don´t even get that.
{22770}{22833}I don´t even get that.|It´s like...
{22833}{22900}they´re just selling you|back to yourself.
{22900}{22952}What is that?
{22952}{23002}Hmm.|I never thought of it that way.
{23002}{23031}-Mm-hmm.|-Um...

{23751}{23796}Did he kill people?
{23796}{23873}He killed their spirits.
{23873}{23925}Did he threaten|their identities?
{23925}{23962}Something like that.
{24009}{24057}So, what about you?
{24107}{24173}He, um...
{24173}{24233}No, no, that´s all right.|Sorry.
{24233}{24293}-No.|-OK.

{24479}{24545}Wow.
{24545}{24610}I don´t think|l´ve ever been adored.
{24610}{24612}CARL: You can get paid|to have sex by a company--
{24612}{24726}CARL: You can get paid|to have sex by a company--
{24726}{24788}I mean.|acting in an adult film--
{24788}{24843}but if some guy pays you|five hundred bucks...
{24843}{24914}to have sex with him.|that´s illegal.
{24914}{24989}So. you´re in porn.
{24989}{25051}Why are you in porn?|Two reasons.
{25051}{25151}Either you need the money.|or you´re an exhibitionist.
{25151}{25207}WOMAN: What do you think|is exhibitionism?
{25207}{25245}CARL: Porn.
{25245}{25332}What--well. no. OK.|That´s a good question.
{25332}{25477}I think it goes way beyond|just wanting to perform.
{25477}{25577}You can´t pretend that you´re|having sex with someone...
{25577}{25653}when you are actually|having sex with them.
{25653}{25769}Well, I think||it´s easier to think...
{25769}{25838}that they´re|enjoying themselves.
{25838}{25899}Or maybe they want you|to enjoy yourselves.
{25899}{25944}Why would you want|to think about it so much?
{25944}{26010}It´s been made to turn you on.|It´s nothing deeper than that.
{26010}{26039}Yes, I do.
{26039}{26118}Sorry. I thought you said|this didn´t bother you.
{26118}{26210}Carl, I can´t have||conversations like this anymore.
{26210}{26250}(Chuckles) You can´t?
{26288}{26325}I´ve met someone.

{27043}{27076}Yep.
{27114}{27230}Yeah, I was just thinking|of the rest of my day.
{27230}{27275}Jerry wants to meet with me.
{27275}{27352}-Really?|-Yes.
{27352}{27417}He´s never liked me,||you know, from day one.
{27417}{27500}Just--nothing I can do|about that. I just, uh--

{28509}{28589}“DUl“--|you´re familiar with the term.
{28589}{28616}Yeah.
{28616}{28652}-Correct?|-Yeah.
{28652}{28727}No. I mean,||what does this have to do with--

{29517}{29554}(Sniffles)
{29554}{29621}Oh, come on, kitten--||the water works?
{29672}{29722}You know,||we´ve talked about this.
{29722}{29759}Nothing´s changed...
{29759}{29816}since the last time|we had this discussion.
{29816}{29849}(Sniffles)
{29849}{29917}No, l´m just--|l´m too committed to my work...
{29917}{29988}to sustain a serious|relationship right now.
{29988}{30082}You know, I bring work|home with me. I´m distracted.
{30082}{30168}I´m taking a swim in Lake Me,|you know?
{30168}{30273}And, you--hey, you deserve|better, believe you me.
{30273}{30332}I would only cause you pain.
{30332}{30401}Remember how I let you|twirl my key chain?
{30401}{30510}Nice, right?|Hugging, kissing, all nice.
{30510}{30588}Now, go on, sweetie.|Go on, split. Come on, come on.
{30622}{30658}I´ll call you.
{30805}{30877}If the phone doesn´t ring,|it´s probably me.
{30877}{30921}(Sighing) Oh, man.
{30921}{30971}(Pager beeping)
{31015}{31096}Fucking Goebbels--|he thinks it´s a toy.
{31133}{31214}(Chuckling)|“Gone to get haircut.“
{31214}{31264}What an asshole.
{31314}{31364}LINDA: I don´t know why.|I just started that.
{31364}{31427}I don´t--I just don´t want|them knowing me. you know?
{31427}{31468}I don´t want them knowing me.
{31468}{31585}I give--I give the name „Ann“|all the time...
{31585}{31625}because it seems like Ann is--
{31625}{31663}One.
{31663}{31729}And it´s less invasive.
{31729}{31792}It´s less--|or more anonymous. you know?
{31792}{31842}More invisible.|If they know me as Ann...
{31842}{31900}they don´t know who really|is in the room with them.
{31936}{31992}And for some reason.|that feels good to me.
{32595}{32669}CAL VIN: „Nicholas.|I will begin simply.
{32669}{32719}“l love you.
{32719}{32779}“Have always loved you...

{33222}{33258}“Until then.“
{33493}{33534}I´ve been away a lot.

{34665}{34768}-lt´s kind of personal.|-Shoot.
{34768}{34836}Is that your real hair?
{34836}{34874}Absolutely.
{34912}{34988}Hmm. I´m thinking of|getting some more.
{34988}{35041}Don´t do that.
{35041}{35114}-Why not?|-You´ll have doll head.
{35114}{35185}I don´t care. I want more hair.
{35185}{35326}Low-level, free-floating|anxiety about it, you know?
{35326}{35363}I have anxiety about it.
{35363}{35417}I see homeless guys|with a full head of hair...
{35417}{35457}and I think, „What the fuck?“
{35457}{35495}You know, Kirk Douglas,|what the fuck--
{35532}{35568}Does Lee mind?
{35611}{35657}Uh, she says no.
{35657}{35703}Well, that´s a lie.
{35703}{35789}She doesn´t say anything,|and I assume that´s a no.
{35789}{35934}We sit in the same room,||we live in the same house...
{35934}{35975}but, uh...
{35975}{36056}-“And.“|-What?
{36056}{36147}Try changing your „but“s|to „and“s. See what happens.
{36187}{36256}We live in the same house,||and--
{36256}{36294}Now you got it.
{36395}{36444}Yes, I would say that.
{36444}{36483}-How often?|-Um...
{36483}{36573}Once a week, once a month,||once a year, once--
{36573}{36657}-This is kind of--|-l´ll come back to that.

{36720}{36763}Well, you know,|not like a bearded guy--
{36763}{36813}It´s a yes or no question,|David.
{36813}{36849}Yes, then.
{36849}{36905}Listen, l´m sorry,|I just thought--
{36905}{36951}I´m going to be straight|with you, David, OK?
{36951}{36986}OK.
{36986}{37038}In three years,|you haven´t impressed...
{37038}{37093}a single person at this agency.

{37540}{37580}Put that chair|against the door.
{37632}{37700}-Ms. Bright?|-Yeah.
{37700}{37745}Is this a joke?|´Cause I´m a good sport.

{37910}{37962}-OK.|-OK?
{37962}{38000}Yeah.

{38593}{38646}WOMAN:|Ooh. are we doing this now?
{38646}{38692}LINDA: Mm-hmm. He wants me|to meet him in Tucson...
{38692}{38742}for the weekend. He´s a kid.
{38742}{38791}-In Tucson?|-Mmm.
{38791}{38847}-You have to try these.|-Do they have sugar?
{38847}{38946}-No. sugar free. Why Tucson?|-Mmm. He lives near there.
{38946}{38992}WOMAN:|Does he live in the desert?

{39035}{39112}-Uhh.|-I´m intrigued.
{39112}{39180}-ln Tucson?|-These are good.
{39180}{39226}I know. They´re sweetened|with fruit juice.
{39226}{39275}I could eat|this whole damn tray.
{39275}{39342}I bought new underwear.
{39342}{39418}-Have you seen a photo?|-No.
{39481}{39567}That Holiday lnn part--|that´s kind of a little sad.
{39567}{39628}-Why is that sad?|-Because, Tucson?
{39628}{39700}-So what? He knows a good one.|-All right.
{39700}{39751}Seems like you put|a lot of thought into this.
{39751}{39793}-Planned--we both have.|-Mm-hmm.
{39793}{39872}-Kind of like a wedding?|-Sort of.
{39872}{39965}OK, I think that was good,|but I really, really think...
{39965}{39995}you guys shouldn´t make|eye contact.
{39995}{40033}Hold on, hold on.
{40033}{40074}That whole thing of you guys|being an extension of me--
{40074}{40139}Hold on.|Stop giving them directions.
{40139}{40187}One second.|Just let me work this out, OK?
{40187}{40234}One second.|You know when we do...
{40234}{40279}that first scene|where l´m exercising...
{40279}{40329}you guys gotta have|athletic supporters.
{40329}{40376}You know what. stop. Stop.
{40376}{40437}Hey. guess who the world|doesn´t revolve around?
{40437}{40478}You. OK? I´m trying--
{40478}{40526}Maybe you want to come out here|and look at it.
{40526}{40563}Give me the jacket--
{40563}{40614}Can I talk to you for a second?
{40614}{40650}I´m fucking giving my all here.
{40650}{40679}I know, I know.
{40679}{40742}I´m giving my all, and|l´m really fucking worried, OK?
{40742}{40787}Because last week you tell me...
{40787}{40835}you want me to play it|like Danny Kaye, right?
{40835}{40877}This morning,|you come in, and you say...
{40877}{40922}“Hey, why don´t you play it|like Alan Alda.“
{40922}{40960}What am l, fucking Danny Alda?
{40960}{41000}OK, I think||you´re really distracted.
{41000}{41037}You´ve been|on the fucking laptop...
{41037}{41108}Iike a little crack monkey,|logging onto Expedia...
{41108}{41150}for this fucking chick|in Tucson?
{41150}{41196}Let me tell you something, man.|This is art.
{41196}{41274}I dumped my girlfriend|the day we started rehearsals.
{41274}{41324}You´re not here, man.||You´re not present.
{41324}{41362}I am here. I am here.
{41362}{41432}You´re not, OK?||And l´m starting to question...
{41432}{41491}whether you and Carl know what|the fuck you´re talking about.
{41491}{41520}Because let me tell you|something...
{41520}{41584}Peter Ustinov said,||“To act is difficult...
{41584}{41648}“but it´s more difficult|to write a bad play...
{41648}{41692}“than to give|a bad performance.“
{41692}{41763}You know what? You know what?
{41763}{41826}What a great fucking idea,|watching me squirm.
{41826}{41878}What are you talking about?
{41878}{41981}-Catherine.|-What are you talking about?
{41981}{42033}-The letter.|-What letter?

{42425}{42458}Hmm.
{42513}{42561}Wow. Well.
{42642}{42698}Pretty extraordinary.
{42698}{42747}Really?
{42826}{42888}This is a prank, right?
{42888}{42951}I mean, that´s cool.||You can tell me.
{42951}{43001}I don´t think it´s a prank, no.
{43001}{43046}You didn´t write this?
{43046}{43109}Is it your fantasy|that I wrote it?
{43109}{43151}Oh, don´t. Don´t do that.
{43151}{43193}I don´t know what to tell you.
{43193}{43230}OK, here´s the deal.
{43230}{43287}This right here,|you can´t write about.
{43287}{43348}-I can´t?|-No, you cannot. It´s not fair.
{43348}{43380}You know, they really do|have ovens back there.
{43380}{43428}I am onto you, girl.
{43428}{43480}Well, I think l´m onto you,|all right?
{43480}{43534}Look at me.
{43534}{43597}-Look at me.|-Oh, my.
{43641}{43680}Come on,||did you write the letter?
{43792}{43825}It´s OK.
{43937}{43966}See?
{44023}{44122}Ahem. I´m just not gonna play|this game with you anymore.
{44122}{44186}I ain´t even thinking about you.|Look.
{44425}{44467}You missed a piece.
{44467}{44519}(Sighs)
{44573}{44666}CARL: So. Tracy--|is that your given name?
{44666}{44710}-Yes.|-Mm-hmm.
{44710}{44787}And what´s your porn name?
{44787}{44817}I´m--
{44817}{44862}Do you know about porn names?
{44862}{44893}-No.|-OK.
{44893}{44942}Your porn name|is your middle name...
{44942}{45059}and the name of the first|street you grew up on.
{45059}{45088}OK.
{45088}{45179}So. Iike. my porn name|is Andrew Highland.
{45179}{45261}(Laughs) It´s terrible.|It´s not very sexy.
{45261}{45329}So. you´re Tracy...
{45329}{45386}I don´t have a middle name.
{45386}{45422}Oh. well. you can--
{45422}{45544}Yeah. well. you can also use|the name of your first pet.
{45544}{45631}We weren´t allowed to have pets.
{45631}{45696}Ivory Coast, Senegal,|Sierra Leone...
{45696}{45729}LEE: Mm-hmm. Good.
{45729}{45799}Ghana, Mali.

{46237}{46279}-Jesus.|-Ethiopia.
{46279}{46362}Time.|You are very impressive.
{46402}{46477}I don´t think|you´re allowed to do this.
{46477}{46529}(Takes polaroid)
{46529}{46569}Of course I am.
{46569}{46625}Get down from there.
{46662}{46729}LEE: Just meet me|in the lobby. please.
{46729}{46802}You´ll have a great time.|I know you´ll love Gus.
{46802}{46857}I can´t go to a party like that.|I have nothing to wear.
{46857}{46922}LEE: Wear the green dress.|You look great in it.
{46922}{46971}It´s too tight.|It doesn´t fit me anymore...
{46971}{47001}and it has a stain that´s--
{47001}{47032}LEE:|You always have an excuse.
{47032}{47072}It´s not an excuse.|Lee, that´s a reason.
{47072}{47106}There´s a difference.
{47106}{47141}Look, are we still||having lunch today?
{47141}{47212}Because I have|a birthday present for you.
{47212}{47263}LEE: It´s tomorrow.
{47263}{47327}You know what? I know|when your birthday is, OK?
{47327}{47372}I´m not here tomorrow.
{47372}{47418}LEE: Hey. Linda...
{47418}{47463}Hello?
{47463}{47505}LEE: You´re breaking up.|Call me back.
{47505}{47564}Hello? Listen, if you can|hear me, call me back.
{47564}{47614}LEE: Call me back.
{47614}{47672}(Hangs up)|Fuck.
{47672}{47718}LINDA:|Yeah. I think about him a lot.
{47718}{47841}You know? It´s hard.|I found him in the basement.
{47841}{47926}And then I found Lee...
{47926}{47982}who was outside. I think.|or somewhere else in the house.
{47982}{48012}I mean. I remember screaming...
{48012}{48075}and then I remember her|appearing.
{48075}{48153}Uh. and then. you know.|no one else was home...
{48153}{48248}so she ran to a neighbor´s...
{48248}{48355}and. uh. I stayed with him.
{48355}{48454}And then neighbors came. and...
{48454}{48490}and then my mom was home.
{48490}{48575}They found my mom. and so...
{48628}{48666}LEE:|It´s pretty surprising...
{48666}{48750}when you see|somebody you know...
{48750}{48857}Iike your dad. you know.|in that state. you know?
{48857}{48895}So. it was surprising...
{48895}{49026}but I think that. you know.|in retrospect. he...
{49060}{49113}(Groaning)
{49113}{49217}He was pretty unhappy...
{49217}{49276}most of the time.
{49302}{49385}My friend Gus says that people--|the straight world--
{49385}{49458}will always be fascinated|by gangster sagas...
{49458}{49514}because, here are these guys...
{49514}{49566}they say,|“We´re not going to live...
{49566}{49601}“by some unspoken rule...
{49601}{49637}“that we don´t take you|to the cleaners...
{49637}{49667}“when you´re not looking.
{49667}{49760}“We don´t have any agreement|not to take advantage of you.“
{49760}{49818}And these people, they´re|in the minority, fortunately...
{49818}{49862}otherwise, there would be chaos.
{49862}{50014}But we love watching them,|because--because...
{50014}{50071}it´s a walk on the wild side...
{50071}{50130}without any real risk|of corruption.
{50130}{50170}It´s two-dimensional, you know?
{50170}{50211}And it´s always|going to be compelling.
{50211}{50298}Uh, you know, sometimes,|we can´t look away.
{50298}{50348}But--and we should.
{50348}{50378}(Door opens)
{50378}{50453}-Hey, Carl, how you doing, pal?|-Good to see you.
{50453}{50526}-You look great.|-Thanks. Uh...
{50526}{50583}you know, that´s amazing|that you called today...
{50583}{50648}because l--ahem--|I needed to see you.
{50648}{50735}I have an idea. I have an idea.|I think it´s a cover.
{51090}{51135}You got slobber|all up on your...
{51135}{51174}Mmm.
{51204}{51272}What time is it?
{51272}{51332}Oh, I feel--I feel nauseous.
{51332}{51395}Are you ready to talk|about this?
{51395}{51486}Ohh. Nicholas...
{51486}{51550}Iook, I think||that you´re very talented...
{51550}{51642}and l´ll probably write|a very nice piece about you...
{51642}{51722}but you´re really annoying|about this whole letter thing.
{51722}{51811}No. You´re annoying.
{51811}{51889}Mm-hmm. OK.
{51889}{51983}CARL: You see. I think that is|worth discussing. I really do.
{51983}{52065}Well, Carl, l´ll discuss||anything with you anytime...
{52065}{52128}because every time|you´ve come into my office...
{52128}{52187}every time|l´ve asked to see you...
{52187}{52247}or you´ve come to see me|with an idea...
{52247}{52291}about a cover|or a feature story...
{52291}{52330}or anything you want to do...
{52330}{52407}it always has validity.|It always has...
{52407}{52473}it´s important to me|to hear your ideas, you know?
{52473}{52503}Thank you. thank you.
{52503}{52540}Let me ask you a question.
{52540}{52584}The reason I called you in|today. actually...
{52584}{52634}Yeah. Sorry. Ahem.
{52634}{52668}I have a question for you...
{52668}{52774}and it´s kind of important|to me to hear the answer.
{52774}{52812}And the question is...
{52812}{52905}when you go to your|refrigerator in your home...
{52905}{53002}and you open the door,|and you see a bottle of beer...
{53002}{53048}do you take|that bottle of beer...
{53048}{53103}and pour it into a glass|and drink it...
{53103}{53162}or do you drink it|from the bottle?
{53228}{53359}Um. I--I--|well. I drink it from a glass.
{53359}{53408}Ah, you see?
{53408}{53489}Ohh. That´s the problem.

{54306}{54347}we´ve heard Poitier say.
{54347}{54394}It´s a new day. some say.

{54836}{54896}Or just cool it,|be anybody, like Denzel.
{54896}{55003}But wait. He ain´t even really|getting no loving...

{55302}{55354}underneath a Pelican Moon?
{55354}{55422}Can even he be a romantic lead?

{55724}{55815}Maybe it is a conspiracy.|But do folks still fear...
{55815}{55901}the black man´s sexuality|like that?
{55901}{56007}A fear that could be wiped out|just by seeing us love...
{56007}{56059}not by race, but by heart.
{56059}{56120}And can´t a brother|get some love?
{56120}{56171}Now, that, Catherine...

{56626}{56685}Who are you? Who are we?
{56685}{56754}We are human, too...

{58459}{58497}Have you ever stayed|at a Holiday lnn?
{58497}{58534}No. Have you?
{58534}{58574}I think that´s what´s|really bothering me.
{58574}{58604}You know what, Lee?||He´s paying for it.
{58604}{58644}So if that´s what´s|really bothering you--
{58644}{58694}-What does he do?|-He´s an artist.
{58694}{58731}-An actor.|-A painter.
{58731}{58760}In Tucson?

{59061}{59112}You´re acting insane.
{59186}{59243}I´m going to have the squash.
{59243}{59317}But this is|a boundary issue. man!
{59317}{59440}What I do off-stage is|my process and my business. OK?
{59440}{59482}And I don´t care|what anybody thinks.
{59482}{59535}And it´s my business|to put on a play.
{59535}{59603}And now l´ve got three hours|to find a new Eva Braun.
{59603}{59660}Oh, OK. You know what?||Fuck her.
{59660}{59713}And here´s why. Number one--
{59713}{59775}anyone who´s offended|by drinking blood...
{59775}{59820}obviously doesn´t drink blood.
{59820}{59896}Number two--anybody who drinks|as much blood as I do...
{59896}{59943}knows it has no effect.
{59943}{59989}Number three--
{59989}{60051}there is absolutely|no scientific connection...
{60051}{60097}between drinking|a shot of blood a day...
{60097}{60144}and being|an extraordinary actor.
{60144}{60259}And number 4--it is impossible|to prove number 3.
{60259}{60311}You know, do the words Masai||mean anything to you?
{60311}{60346}Do you know who that is?
{60346}{60401}Yeah. Herzog made|a documentary about them.
{60401}{60456}The herdsmen of fire.|warriors of Africa.
{60456}{60496}They drank blood.
{60496}{60548}Jack fucking LaLanne|drank blood in the fifties.
{60548}{60593}Yeah. granted.|his wife wouldn´t kiss him...
{60593}{60632}but this is bullshit. man.
{60632}{60683}I don´t care what you do|outside of this theater.
{60683}{60765}I don´t give a shit. You could|eat the ass out of a dead wolf.
{60765}{60813}I don´t care.
{60813}{60869}Just keep it to yourself, OK?
{60869}{60929}Just keep it to yourself.
{60929}{60989}I think it´s fucking hysterical|that she walked.
{60989}{61040}And I know comedy.
{61040}{61076}LINDA: I don´t understand.
{61076}{61118}I don´t understand|what´s wrong.
{61118}{61155}I mean. birthdays are fun.
{61155}{61242}Well, OK, this is mom||when I was four...
{61242}{61295}at my birthday|introducing me to people.
{61295}{61430}“And this is Lee. She ruined|my body, didn´t you, dear?“
{61430}{61470}-There.|-Thanks.
{61470}{61518}I won´t be here tomorrow.|so happy birthday.
{61518}{61609}Oh. It´s smaller than the gift|you gave me last year...
{61609}{61657}for my fortieth birthday.
{61657}{61705}You know what. Lee. you make|forty a bigger deal than it is.
{61705}{61774}You have no idea about forty.
{61774}{61819}I´ll be forty.
{61819}{61864}What did I give you last year?|I don´t even remember.
{61864}{61965}You know, that--that thing.|That...
{61965}{62073}-Oh. You didn´t like it?|-No.
{62073}{62136}Well. honestly.|I would have rather had...
{62136}{62178}just. Iike.|a card or something.
{62178}{62211}OK. God.
{62211}{62246}It´s just a weird gift|to give your sister...
{62246}{62297}who´s married.|on her fortieth birthday.
{62297}{62347}You know what Gus gave me|last year for my birthday?
{62347}{62420}First edition of Bernard Shaw´s|The Sanity of Art.
{62420}{62485}Did you get anything out of it?
{62485}{62543}-Which?|-The gift I gave you.
{62601}{62651}Are you kidding?
{62651}{62726}No. I mean, yes or no.
{62726}{62763}But for my fortieth birthday?
{62763}{62835}Well, I have one, so...
{62835}{62886}I used it once.
{62886}{62976}OK. All right.|Well, what happened?
{62976}{63030}Um, I got stuck in the chair.
{63072}{63169}You used it in a chair?
{63169}{63260}Well, yeah,|that´s what´s on the box.
{63260}{63325}Different ways. I´ve never...
{63325}{63384}Not in a chair. I´ve never...
{63384}{63438}Well...
{63438}{63510}gift-giving--|you know, it´s an art.
{63510}{63570}You should have|the person in mind--
{63570}{63633}OK, l´m sorry. I thought|you´d like it. I like it--
{63633}{63690}Well. that´s--|but you should give people...
{63690}{63729}what you think|they would want--
{63729}{63767}you know. something personal.
{63767}{63825}How much more personal|could that be?
{63825}{63900}But then. you and that guy--|what was his name?
{63900}{63932}-Tom.|-Tom.
{63932}{63997}Yeah. You sat at|the other end of the table...
{63997}{64044}and just stared|at each other the whole time.
{64044}{64093}You didn´t even|really socialize.
{64093}{64151}Oh, my God. Oh, my God.|Lee, forgive me, OK?
{64151}{64231}I happened to be in love--|for a brief period of time.
{64231}{64272}Once--which happened|to include...
{64272}{64306}the week of your birthday.
{64306}{64345}-This is all a year later.|-You don´t get it.
{64345}{64388}Christ!

{64428}{64470}A gift is a gift.|Don´t question it.
{64470}{64556}At least not to the giver|and out loud a whole year later.
{64597}{64625}Chr--
{64662}{64709}-OK, now I know.||-What?
{64709}{64748}Well, that it meant something|to you.
{64748}{64797}What?
{64797}{64882}Just the whole thing,|that you put thought into it.
{65025}{65087}You know.|it´s for your small change.
{65149}{65213}FRANCESCA: So he gives me|this injection...
{65213}{65283}and I become invisible.
{65283}{65325}And I can do anything. right?
{65325}{65371}Because. you know.|I´m invisible.
{65371}{65494}What do I do? I go to|one of my colleagues. Carl...
{65494}{65569}and I make him|sign a confession...
{65569}{65649}while I hold a knife|to his neck.
{65649}{65753}Now. it´s just weird.|because I really like Carl.
{65753}{65809}He´s a brilliant,||talented man...
{65809}{65876}completely misunderstood|by his boss.
{65876}{65996}Well, you know, l´m not|surprised he was in my dream...
{65996}{66101}really, because|I think of him a lot.
{66150}{66215}I think l´m actually--
{66215}{66255}MAN: Wheel in Nicholas.|We´re ready for him.
{66255}{66287}It´s funny, because|he´s one of these guys--
{66287}{66330}You know what?|I want to tell you...
{66330}{66414}what I think about that,||but I gotta go do this.
{66414}{66504}OK. I´ll be here--listening.

{66675}{66749}OK, exactly the same thing.|We´re starting from over here.
{66749}{66782}It took me a little bit--
{66782}{66812}I needed to do this|with track...
{66812}{66841}instead of just the walk-up...
{66841}{66884}so we´re gonna do|a little bit of a push-in.
{66884}{66930}There´s probably|going to be some focus stuff...
{66930}{66967}so we´re gonna shoot a few.
{66967}{66996}OK.
{66996}{67038}But just split the extras|as they come through--
{67038}{67071}don´t be precious about it.
{67071}{67109}Tell them we´re coming through.
{67109}{67166}I will, I will.

{69154}{69215}Hey. that´s simple.|Well. there. I can write that.
{69215}{69244}I can write.|“I´m not so great. „

{71942}{71975}Well, you could find out.
{71975}{72076}Yeah. The point is, the answer|to your question is...

{74783}{74847}CARL: Oh. the film.|Well. the film--
{74847}{74890}Artie and I wrote this.
{74890}{74928}We started working together--
{74928}{74981}really writing together.|about a year ago.
{74981}{75031}We tossed around|a couple of ideas.
{75031}{75120}And Artie´s a pretty good|playwright in his own right.
{75120}{75198}And we thought.|you know. maybe this--
{75198}{75284}sort of my understanding|of Hollywood and everything...
{75284}{75351}and his ability|to actually write...
{75351}{75401}would be a good combination...
{75401}{75453}and so we came up|with this idea...
{75453}{75516}for what is now|Rendezvous. the movie.
{75516}{75601}It´s almost like a spy film|in the intrigue...
{75601}{75682}of this romantic encounter...
{75682}{75801}between this guy|that Calvin plays--
{75801}{75859}I´m sorry. there´s a...
{75901}{75951}Uh. and this woman.
{75951}{76010}And anyway.|I think it´s a neat story.
{76010}{76101}And I think it´s a great cast.
{76101}{76226}Um. uh. but. uh...
{76226}{76301}Yeah. I´m sorry.|I have some--it´s weird.
{76301}{76383}I´m really happy about|the project. I really am.
{76383}{76464}I got--you know. there´s--|I´ve got issues with some of--
{76464}{76552}Actually. Calvin. Calvin is.|I think. I don ´t know--
{76552}{76585}You know. other people...
{76585}{76646}get more excited about him|than I do.
{76646}{76744}It´s not to say I´m not happy|having him on the movie.
{76744}{76816}I think that´s great. and|I´m sure he´s very good in it.
{76816}{76963}I just don´t get what|the big thing is with Calvin.
{76963}{77070}I think--you know. you picture|a role in a certain way...
{77070}{77141}And sometimes it´s--|I´m not always right. either.
{77141}{77212}I know. you know. certainly|my wife thinks he´s great.

{78250}{78327}I don´t even want to talk|to the guys l´m dating.
{78372}{78472}Uh-huh.|Well. I´m not dating anyone.
{78472}{78520}A date is not dating.
{78520}{78592}Well, you know,|someone buys you dinner...
{78592}{78666}you owe them a phone call,|in my opinion.

{120555}{120622}Gus and I used|to hunt together. all right?
{120622}{120689}And this one time, we´re||waiting up in this deer stand...
{120689}{120776}and, uh, Gus climbs down...
{120776}{120842}to relieve himself|in the bushes, OK?

{122046}{122075}And if you fall,|you´re fucked...

{128156}{128254}the effect that would have|on a ten-year-old girl.
{128254}{128329}I think Lee is like...

{128437}{128511}but walk away?
{128511}{128612}And... there´s this impact...

{128665}{128718}has happened to that dog...
{128718}{128774}but it walks away...
{128774}{128876}and it doesn´t seem to even|realize the implications...
{128876}{128911}´cause it just goes on.
{128911}{129008}But you know|that something terrible...
{129008}{129058}has happened inside this dog.
{129058}{129127}LEE:|Why do you think he did it?

{129354}{129428}LEE: No. Not this.
{129526}{129579}Ohh.
{129579}{129624}CARL: That´s. I think.|what happened to Lee.
{129624}{129668}It´s like--it´s like--
{129668}{129732}She´s a dog that got hit by|a car. and she walked away...
{129732}{129841}and she´s still walking. but...
{129841}{129887}LINDA: I don´t know.|I guess he was really sad.
{129887}{129946}CARL: Some very. very|important things...
{129946}{130015}inside her are damaged.
{130153}{130197}LEE: Oh.
{130197}{130248}Jesus.
{130248}{130337}(Traffic noise)
{130337}{130455}CARL: So... my wife and I|were having trouble...
{130455}{130542}and I said I thought|maybe we were in a rut...
{130542}{130594}and that maybe|we should try something...
{130594}{130686}to liven things up.|and she said. „Like what?“
{130686}{130834}And I said like maybe we should|tape ourselves doing it.
{130834}{130887}And she was|completely shocked by this...
{130887}{130952}and she thought|it was beyond disgusting...
{130952}{131027}and that was that|for. Iike. four months.
{131027}{131084}And then one night.|out of the blue...
{131084}{131169}she says. „Let´s do it. „
{131169}{131248}Ohh... (Laughs)
{131248}{131391}So, we get it all set up, and|l´m ready and she´s ready...
{131391}{131500}and, uh, and she has gone out|and bought herself...
{131500}{131604}a little toy to use|in the video.
{131604}{131633}Really?
{131633}{131757}Well, it´s not a little toy.|It´s a--it´s a huge...
{131757}{131796}(Giggling)
{131796}{131847}Fucking...I mean, it was--
{131847}{131904}No one has a--you know, OK.
{131904}{131949}Well, anyway, I took one look|at this thing...
{131949}{132006}and I knew|I would not be able to--
{132006}{132035}(Laughs)
{132035}{132147}I mean, it--I just couldn´t--|I couldn´t...
{132226}{132261}I couldn´t.
{132357}{132418}So we haven´t.
{132444}{132527}And, you know...
{132527}{132640}you can´t come back|from something like that.
{132640}{132732}I don´t know whether|she lost respect for me...
{132732}{132874}or I lost respect for myself,|but something was lost.
{132928}{132981}HEATHER:|What are you going to do?
{132981}{133046}CARL: I have no idea.
{133046}{133142}I mean. I know professionally.|I´m gonna go back to teaching.
{133142}{133177}I always loved teaching.
{133177}{133206}-Really?|-Yeah.

{133702}{133736}HEATHER: Hmm.
{133736}{133850}CARL: Aside from loving her.|I just really like her.
{133850}{133913}A lot.
{133913}{133985}But...
{133985}{134027}I guess she thinks...
{134027}{134131}everyone and everything|is against her.
{134131}{134220}Somehow I just think...
{134220}{134283}it keeps her from being happy.

{134442}{134483}Is that your wife?

{138735}{138773}LEE: Huh?
{138881}{138945}LEE: I really don´t know|what you should do...
{138945}{138982}when you´re in love|with someone.
{138982}{139042}I know that you´re thinking|about them all the time.
{139042}{139138}You want to be with them|and see things with them.
{139138}{139216}I think it´s impossible.|It´s an ideal to just think...
{139216}{139324}that you can actually|be kind all the time...
{139324}{139400}and never be disappointed|in them or by them.
{139400}{139561}It´s hard. I mean. it´s like|the dream is short-lived.
{139561}{139703}CARL: You´ve got|to keep hoping that...
{139805}{139869}that there´s more.
{139922}{139983}FRANCESCA:|You know. you always--
{139983}{140028}It´s when|you least expect it...

{140576}{140609}So. that makes it nice...
{140609}{140652}but I think|that it´s just fate...

{140708}{140783}I don ´t know. And today. just|negative ions in the air...
