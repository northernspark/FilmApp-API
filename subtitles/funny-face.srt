{3545}{3592}Good morning, Miss Prescott.
{3652}{3697}Good morning, Miss Prescott.
{3900}{3952}Nowhear this.
{4346}{4425}I simply cannot release this issue|the way it is.
{4428}{4535}In the 60 years of Quality|magazine, this hits rock bottom.
{4538}{4625}If I let this go through, I will have|failed the American woman.
{4628}{4672}No, Miss Prescott, don't say that.
{4675}{4747}The great American woman,|who stands out there naked,
{4750}{4821}waiting for me|to tell her what to wear.
{4825}{4873}It doesn't speak.
{4876}{4957}And if it won't speak to me,|it won't speak to anyone.
{4982}{5057}A magazine|must be like a human being.
{5060}{5122}If it comes into the home|it must contribute.
{5125}{5196}It just can't lie around.
{5200}{5250}A magazine must have...
{5275}{5340}..blood and brains and pizzazz.
{5343}{5378}This is just paper.
{5381}{5459}If I send paper to the American|woman, I will have let her down.
{5462}{5514}No, Miss Prescott,|you mustn't say that.
{5517}{5564}Yes. D for down.
{5567}{5601}D for dreary.
{5604}{5705}D for dull and for depressing,
{5708}{5750}dismal and deadly!
{5831}{5894}Ahh! Here it is.
{5897}{5966}Here is our theme.|Here is our answer. Pink.
{6205}{6257}I want dresses made up in this pink.
{6260}{6303}Babs, take this to Kaiser Delmont.
{6306}{6360}I want shoes and stockings|in this colour.
{6363}{6422}Laura, everything goes pink!
{6425}{6498}I want the whole issue pink.|I want the whole country pink!
{6501}{6598}Lettie, take an editorial.|"To the women of America..."
{6601}{6662}No, make it|"To the women everywhere."
{6670}{6706}Banish the black,
{6709}{6745}burn the blue,
{6747}{6795}and bury the beige.
{6798}{6841}From now on, girls...
{10189}{10223}Maggie?
{10236}{10280}Dovitch. I want to see you.
{10282}{10353}Girls, back to work.|Gentlemen, that will do.
{10356}{10417}The railroad|is going to paint a whole train pink
{10420}{10454}and send it on a tour.
{10457}{10519}TWA will let me know|if we can have a pink plane.
{10522}{10599}I haven't seen a woman in two weeks|in anything but pink.
{10602}{10678}- What about you?|- Me? I wouldn't be caught dead.
{10681}{10770}Dovitch, I can't wait to tell you|about my feature for the next issue.
{10773}{10855}It's my newest project.|When you hear it, you will drop.
{10858}{10909}- Now what?|- Just you listen.
{10913}{10974}Dick Avery|started working on the pictures.
{10977}{11034}He's more excited about it|than any of us.
{11037}{11131}Here it is. Clothes for the woman|who isn't interested in clothes.
{11144}{11222}Marion, give me a long look.
{11225}{11250}Longer.
{11316}{11408}Steve, tip that back light down|a bit, will you? OK.
{11448}{11550}Hold it, boys.|Beethoven isn't working. Try Brahms.
{11553}{11638}Look, Marion,|I'd like to try it again.
{11641}{11702}This time,|let's see if we can't get with it.
{11705}{11771}Keep in mind|that you're a woman who thinks.
{11774}{11840}That is a piece of sculpture|by ltsabuchi.
{11843}{11957}Look at it as if you understand it.|As if it understands you. See?
{12028}{12123}No, that's not the way we look|when we're thinking of ltsabuchi.
{12126}{12194}React to it. Just... say it.
{12226}{12297}Itsabuchi, hmm?
{12322}{12416}You haven't quite got it.|Now, listen carefully.
{12419}{12487}You are in the Museum of Modern Art,|Marion.
{12491}{12557}Deep, Marion. Profound, Marion.
{12559}{12631}You have come across this statue.|It says something to you
{12634}{12691}because you are intellectual,|always thinking.
{12716}{12767}What are you thinking?
{12770}{12829}I'm thinking|this is taking a long time,
{12833}{12913}and I'll never be able to|pick up Harold's laundry.
{12920}{12993}When Harold doesn't get his laundry,|disaster!
{12997}{13109}If we don't get this fixed, you may|never see Harold again. Let's go.
{13112}{13204}The woman who thinks must come|to grips with fashionable attire.
{13207}{13301}A woman can be beautiful, as well|as intellectual. See facing page.
{13304}{13337}And how is the facing page?
{13340}{13432}The facing page looks|as intellectual as a snake.
{13435}{13498}Nonsense. Marion can be very deep.
{13501}{13548}Look at her. She's reading.
{13574}{13646}Marion, dear, what are you reading?
{13649}{13682}Minute Men From Mars.
{13721}{13799}Are we all gonna hang around,|or get somebody else?
{13802}{13860}- How about Lucy Brand?|- On her honeymoon.
{13864}{13925}- Betty Hayes?|- She's in jail.
{13928}{13989}Are there no models|who think as well as they look?
{13992}{14061}Marion might look better|in a different background.
{14064}{14122}We can go on location.|An intellectual hang-out.
{14125}{14171}- Somewhere with books.|- A book store.
{14174}{14259}A sinister place|in Greenwich Village. Come on, girls.
{14262}{14357}Let's hurry. We might have to pick up|Harold's laundry on the way.
{14531}{14560}There's one.
{14582}{14618}Driver, stop here.
{14621}{14655}That's sinister enough.
{14732}{14793}Melissa, help me with this lamp.|It's heavy.
{14796}{14849}I can't, Babs, I got my hands full.
{14999}{15100}It's movingly dismal. We couldn't|have done better if we'd designed it.
{15104}{15156}Marion looks smarter already.
{15260}{15348}I'm sorry. I didn't see you up there.|Are you alright?
{15389}{15495}Yes, thank you. Can I help you?|Would you like a book?
{15498}{15587}- Marion, over here.|- Who are those...?
{15616}{15647}May I help you?
{15650}{15716}Thank you.|We have everything we need.
{15719}{15764}Please tell me what this is about.
{15767}{15818}We're just going to take|a few pictures.
{15821}{15857}What sort of pictures?
{15860}{15907}- Are you the owner?|- No, Dr Post is.
{15910}{15963}I work here,|and I'm in charge in her absence.
{15966}{16028}I'm Jo Stockton. Can you help me?
{16031}{16079}How do you do? I'm Dick Avery.
{16082}{16116}What about these pictures?
{16119}{16157}We want the shop as a background
{16159}{16221}for fashion pictures|for Quality magazine.
{16224}{16305}I'm sorry. I can't let you.|Dr Post would never approve.
{16308}{16360}She doesn't approve|of fashion magazines.
{16363}{16452}It's chi-chi and an unrealistic|approach to self-impressions.
{16455}{16538}- We have trouble. She's a thinker.|- She's also a talker.
{16541}{16583}I must ask you to leave.
{16586}{16627}We throw ourselves at your mercy.
{16630}{16702}Haven't poor people like us|a right to make a living?
{16705}{16750}I asked you to leave.|That is my right.
{16753}{16789}If the rights of the individual
{16792}{16857}are not respected by the group,|the group cannot exist.
{16860}{16887}What does that mean?
{16890}{16967}"Do unto others as|you would have others do unto you."
{16970}{17016}We'll only do unto you for a moment,
{17019}{17097}and it's no more|than we would do unto ourselves.
{17100}{17149}Girls, I want these books rearranged.
{17152}{17227}They look too much alike.|They're too pat. Mix them up.
{17230}{17279}No, you mustn't mix them up.
{17282}{17341}The books on this shelf|pertain to empiricism,
{17344}{17427}and on this shelf, materialism,|and on this, psychopiscoparalysm.
{17430}{17509}Put them back. Please talk to her.|It'll take me hours.
{17512}{17579}One never talks to Maggie Prescott.|One only listens.
{17582}{17673}Here. I think we ought to use her|in the shot. Miss, come here, please.
{17676}{17749}- Me?|- You're selling a book to that girl.
{17751}{17774}Her?
{17777}{17831}Just pretend that Marion can read.
{17834}{17867}Say, listen!
{17870}{17905}Alright, Marion, let's go.
{17908}{17986}But this would be a violation|of all my principles.
{17989}{18053}It would be hypocrisy for me|to lend myself to this.
{18056}{18089}- I'm sorry, but...|- Shush.
{18092}{18172}Now, tell Marion about the books|so that we can get out of here.
{18219}{18309}This deals with epiphenomenalism,|which has to do with consciousness
{18312}{18379}as a mere accessory|of physiological processes
{18383}{18495}whose presence or absence|makes no difference...
{18511}{18558}Whatever are you doing?
{18561}{18590}Hold it!
{18593}{18661}- Good. Get her in another outfit.|- Put on the shebop.
{18664}{18753}None of you seems to realise you're|trespassing on private property.
{18757}{18838}You run around, ignorant of the fact|that I can have you put in jail.
{18841}{18899}- For the last time...|- You're getting tiresome.
{18902}{18935}What are you doing?
{18938}{18984}Let go. Let go of my arm.
{18987}{19062}I know you don't mean any harm,|but you are in everyone's way.
{19065}{19098}Now, we won't be a moment.
{19125}{19157}Let me in.
{19160}{19236}The air will do her good.|She was very pale.
{19431}{19454}Alright, hit it.
{19464}{19507}Hold it. Ready?
{19510}{19552}Good. One more, please.
{19554}{19602}Alright. Hit it.
{19605}{19630}Hold it. Ready?
{19655}{19715}Very good, Marion.|One more, please. Last one.
{19718}{19746}Alright, here we go.
{19749}{19783}Hit it.
{19786}{19827}Hold it. Ready.
{19830}{19891}OK, that's it. That ought to do.
{20311}{20368}- Quite through?|- Thank you. You've been wonderful.
{20371}{20422}We'll mention the shop|in the magazine.
{20425}{20455}Don't you dare!
{20458}{20500}Taxi!
{20551}{20602}Oh, no!
{20689}{20721}Hello there.
{20724}{20773}I stayed to help you|put these back.
{20776}{20831}I didn't realise we made such a mess.
{20834}{20892}Which shelf for materialism?
{20895}{20947}Just hand them to me.
{20977}{21028}Oh, no.
{21100}{21144}You should be ashamed of yourself.
{21146}{21190}We don't usually barge in that way.
{21193}{21263}I mean a man of your ability|wasting his time
{21266}{21332}photographing silly dresses|on silly women.
{21354}{21443}Most people think they're|beautiful dresses on beautiful women.
{21446}{21497}At most, a synthetic beauty.
{21522}{21564}Trees are beautiful.
{21612}{21665}Why don't you photograph trees?
{21668}{21740}I do what I do for a living.|It has to do with supply and demand.
{21743}{21822}You'd be amazed how small|the demand is for pictures of trees.
{21825}{21878}My work is pleasant,|the pay is excellent,
{21881}{21925}and I get a trip to Paris every year.
{21928}{21962}I certainly envy you that.
{21965}{22030}I'd be in Paris now|if I could afford it.
{22098}{22126}You'd have a ball.
{22129}{22186}You'd go to a party every night,|drink champagne,
{22189}{22268}swim in perfume, and a new love|affair every hour on the hour.
{22271}{22358}If I went to Paris, it would be|to go to Emile Flostre's lectures.
{22362}{22407}Who goes to Paris for lectures?
{22410}{22477}Professor Flostre|is the greatest living philosopher,
{22480}{22535}and father of empathicalism.
{22538}{22599}Oh? What's empathicalism?
{22616}{22723}The most sensible approach to|true understanding and peace of mind.
{22726}{22761}Sounds great, but what is it?
{22764}{22804}It's based on empathy.
{22808}{22861}Do you know|what the word "empathy" means?
{22864}{22931}No, I'll have to have|the beginner's course on that one.
{22934}{22991}Empathy.|Is it something like sympathy?
{22995}{23038}Oh, it goes beyond sympathy.
{23042}{23104}Sympathy|is to understand what someone feels.
{23107}{23160}Empathy|is to project your imagination
{23163}{23256}so that you actually feel|what the other person is feeling.
{23259}{23324}You put yourself|in the other person's place.
{23327}{23379}Do I make myself clear?
{23613}{23672}- Why did you do that?|- Empathy.
{23675}{23766}I put myself in your place and|I felt that you wanted to be kissed.
{23815}{23865}You put yourself in the wrong place.
{23868}{23951}I have no desire to be kissed|by you, or anyone else.
{23955}{24040}Don't be silly. Everybody wants|to be kissed, even philosophers.
{24072}{24144}I'm sorry, Mr Avery, we don't stock|what you're looking for.
{24147}{24176}I'll let you out.
{24179}{24254}Don't bother. I'll throw myself out.
{24342}{24365}Goodbye.
{30440}{30485}What do you think?
{30488}{30543}Good models.|What have you in mind?
{30546}{30590}A fantastic idea.
{30593}{30649}It staggers me|nobody's thought of it before.
{30652}{30714}I'm going to select a girl|to be the Quality Woman.
{30717}{30799}This girl will represent everything|the magazine stands for.
{30802}{30883}It's a great gimmick. Any|of these models would be alright.
{30886}{30976}She's got to be more than alright.|She's got to have pizzazz.
{30979}{31067}A collection will be designed for her|by the greatest couturier in Paris.
{31071}{31126}- Paul Duval?|- Yes, Paul Duval.
{31129}{31227}And he's going to let us photograph|the collection before the opening.
{31230}{31284}We'll scoop every other magazine.
{31287}{31338}- Staggers you, doesn't it?|- I can't believe it.
{31341}{31435}He would be barred|from all the other fashion magazines.
{31438}{31527}Nonsense. If the project comes off,|we'll all be heroes.
{31530}{31628}Wait till you see what I've got.|The girl. The Quality Woman.
{31631}{31657}Oh, Marion's...
{31660}{31730}Forget her. This is the other girl|I'm talking about.
{31733}{31777}That thing from the book shop?
{31780}{31839}Maggie, she's new.
{31850}{31881}She's fresh.
{31885}{31921}You've gone out of your mind.
{31924}{31996}One can't deny that she is unusual.|Who is she?
{31999}{32086}Don't even ask. The thought of her|makes me shudder. Dreadful girl.
{32089}{32131}If this is some sort ofjoke...
{32134}{32214}It's no joke. If we do her over|and fix her up, she'd be great.
{32217}{32246}She'd devour us all.
{32249}{32299}- Come on, Maggie.|- Well, look at her.
{32326}{32371}I think her face is perfectly funny.
{32374}{32446}The Quality Woman must have grace,|elegance and pizzazz.
{32449}{32510}This is the first time|I've seen you lack imagination.
{32513}{32592}Every girl in Quality|has grace, elegance and pizzazz.
{32595}{32672}What about a girl with character,|spirit and intelligence?
{32675}{32726}That would be novel|in a fashion magazine.
{32729}{32774}Sir, I owe you a drink.
{32777}{32821}Can you make me some enlargements?
{32824}{32863}- Yes.|- Use our darkroom.
{32866}{32933}- Let me study the possibilities.|- Now you are talking.
{32936}{33005}- I'm not promising anything.|- You don't have to.
{33031}{33108}Runs around here|like he owns the magazine.
{33110}{33168}Lettie, remember that creature|in the book shop?
{33171}{33210}Get her up here. Order books.
{33213}{33288}- A large order, so she can't refuse.|- $50 worth?
{33291}{33349}Yes, $50 worth if necessary.
{33352}{33452}$50 to get her up here. We'll have to|drug her to get her to Paris.
{33648}{33709}Miss Prescott, please.
{33712}{33800}- Lettie, you'd better come out here.|- I've got the books she ordered.
{33817}{33893}Miss Prescott's secretary|will deal with you.
{33908}{33974}Oh, it's you. Well, come on in.
{33990}{34017}Come on.
{34152}{34186}The books are here.
{34297}{34324}Come in.
{34506}{34605}That'll be $52 and 75 cents,|and $1.20 for the taxi.
{34609}{34651}$53.95.
{34654}{34695}Drop the books.
{34698}{34734}Come on, drop the books.
{34737}{34789}- On the floor?|- Yes, drop them.
{34858}{34898}Straighten up, shoulders back.
{34901}{34994}If you girls only knew|how important posture is.
{34997}{35057}I didn't come here|to enrol in a military school.
{35060}{35124}All I want is $53.95.
{35127}{35167}The Modigliani is $12.50,
{35170}{35246}and the Braque and Hieronymus Bosch|come to $22.75.
{35249}{35298}$7 for the postimpressionists
{35301}{35368}and $10.50 for The Egyptians -|Fourth to Seventh Dynasties
{35371}{35467}make it a total of $52.75,|and there's $1.20 for the taxi.
{35470}{35525}- Talks incessantly.|- The body's good.
{35528}{35589}It'll be better|when we get through with it.
{35592}{35669}- Through with what?|- She might do.
{35672}{35705}Might do what?
{35726}{35763}The bones are good.
{35766}{35849}Suppose we leave my bones alone|and give me my $53.95?
{35852}{35896}The eyebrows up, a light powder.
{35899}{35971}I want a little rouge here.|She needs a marvellous mouth.
{35974}{36031}The hair is awful. It must come off.
{36035}{36094}Would you mind telling me|what all this is about?
{36105}{36191}We may as well get started. Babs,|get that dreadful thing off of her.
{36194}{36256}Now, wait a minute. Just a minute.
{36259}{36301}Don't! Stop!
{36316}{36393}This is my second and last encounter|with you lunatics.
{36396}{36453}You just keep your hands off me,|all of you.
{36468}{36547}I make a delivery and find myself|being pillaged and plundered.
{36551}{36624}Well, I'll have no more of it.|I don't want my hair cut.
{36627}{36704}I don't want my eyebrows up or down.|I want them where they are.
{36707}{36816}And I see no functional advantage|in a marvellous mouth.
{36819}{36887}I'm leaving now, and if anyone|makes a move to stop me
{36890}{36956}there'll be plenty of hair cut,|and it won't be mine.
{37033}{37062}Bring her back, girls, alive!
{37224}{37256}Hurry up.
{37332}{37379}Hurry. Over here.
{37546}{37607}Hey,|didn't you see that light outside?
{37628}{37708}In desperation, one does not examine|one's avenue of escape.
{37711}{37746}Oh, it's you.
{37807}{37857}I'm sorry if I spoiled a print.
{37860}{37948}That's alright.|What's all the desperation about?
{37951}{37990}Those people.
{37993}{38059}They don't care about|anyone's feelings.
{38076}{38144}Pulling my clothes|and cutting my hair.
{38147}{38216}Is that girl in there?
{38219}{38264}Don't give me away.
{38267}{38318}Maybe you should give them|a chance...
{38321}{38370}There was no one here when I came in.
{38373}{38420}If you see her, hang on to her.
{38464}{38496}I'll do that.
{38536}{38635}I'm afraid it's all my fault.|I thought you'd make a good model.
{38660}{38692}This is your idea?
{38695}{38739}Yeah, I'm the one you sue.
{38753}{38800}Oh, how could I be a model?
{38822}{38901}I have no illusions about my looks.|I think my face is funny.
{38904}{38940}That's what Maggie said.
{38943}{38988}I hate to admit it,|but she's right.
{38991}{39075}What you call funny,|I call interesting.
{39131}{39195}It's too ridiculous|even to think about.
{39198}{39283}- I couldn't do it.|- Let me be the judge of that.
{39298}{39389}I wouldn't take you to Paris|if I didn't think you'd work out.
{39392}{39465}- Paris?|- Yeah. Look at it this way.
{39468}{39519}Modelling|may not be as bad as you think.
{39523}{39619}If it is, you'll be in Paris.|You can see your Professor Whosis.
{39622}{39660}- Flostre?|- Yeah.
{39663}{39719}You can talk to him|and go to his lectures.
{39722}{39769}That way it won't be a total loss.
{39791}{39833}A means to an end.
{39836}{39914}Or a means to a beginning,|according to how it works out.
{39917}{39944}Now, let's see.
{39984}{40019}There we are.
{40022}{40091}- Oh, no.|- What's the matter?
{40094}{40170}How can you possibly|make a model out of that?
{40173}{40206}You can't be serious.
{40209}{40261}When I'm done, you'll look like...
{40264}{40371}What do you call beautiful?|A tree. You'll look like a tree.
{45139}{45222}Ladies, feast your eyes|on our Quality Woman.
{45225}{45259}Marvellous!
{45295}{45354}I'm sorry about the trouble.|I didn't realise.
{45357}{45449}My dear, let me do the apologising.|I behaved abominably.
{45452}{45511}She's agreed to go to Paris.|She can hardly wait.
{45514}{45537}Marvellous!
{45540}{45630}This is not a loss of integrity.|It is a means to an end, and...
{45634}{45694}There's no time for talking.|Tell us on the plane.
{45697}{45785}Alright, girls, we've got to|get cracking. To work and to Paris.
{47081}{47162}- Would you like a tour of Paris?|- No, we're not tourists.
{47165}{47217}Do we look like people|who gape all day?
{47220}{47279}They can't understand anyone|coming here to work.
{47282}{47355}We should all go straight to|our hotels and get some rest.
{47358}{47410}- I am exhausted.|- I know how you feel.
{47413}{47471}I'm so tired it's an effort for me|to say I'm tired.
{47474}{47536}Goodbye. I'll be in touch.
{54581}{54623}Well, how was that?
{54781}{54880}Duval! I can't hear myself think,|and I'm trying to think in French.
{54883}{54939}- Maggie!|- Ssh! I'm calling again.
{54942}{55000}I shouldn't design|a collection for you.
{55003}{55087}I am jeopardising my position|with Harper's Bazaar and Vogue,
{55090}{55131}all for a girl who does not appear.
{55134}{55253}You're too important forjeopardy.|Relax. She will be here without fail.
{55256}{55337}You said she would be here at ten|this morning. It is now past five.
{55340}{55394}- She's not at the hotel.|- Forget about her.
{55397}{55477}We've started the campaign.|There isn't time to get someone else.
{55480}{55504}Well, where is she?
{55507}{55586}Maybe at the top of the Eiffel Tower,|or the bottom of the Seine.
{55589}{55655}Maybe she's in a traffic jam.|How should I know?
{55826}{55896}I'm throwing a shindig|to christen the Quality Woman.
{55899}{55958}Leave it to Dick to find|a delicatessen in Paris.
{55962}{56032}Imported all the way|from Napa Valley, California.
{56035}{56062}Melons from Florida.
{56065}{56137}About the guest of honour.|Where is she? How does she look?
{56140}{56191}If she's here, she looks invisible.
{56194}{56233}- She didn't show?|- She did not.
{56236}{56295}These gentlemen are waiting|to do her face, hair.
{56298}{56355}Duval needs measurements.|Where is she?
{56358}{56424}I wouldn't like to swear in court,|but I have an idea.
{56427}{56486}Do keep it to yourself!
{56489}{56566}I'll have her here|tomorrow morning at ten without fail.
{56570}{56615}In the meantime, be my guests.
{56681}{56704}Strike.
{57314}{57356}This must be the place.
{57669}{57696}Thank you.
{57736}{57804}Monsieur, Gigi would like to dance.
{57807}{57852}- Who's Gigi?|- I am Gigi.
{57855}{57943}Some other time. I just stopped by|to pick up the wife and kids.
{57946}{58040}All that is delicious|is not nutritious.
{58046}{58092}Avaricious, av...
{58095}{58146}I feel a hostile vibration.
{58149}{58186}That'll be me. Sorry.
{58345}{58379}Has he been that way long?
{58382}{58449}Three hours.|It is the ultimate in concentration.
{58452}{58492}Feels so good when you stop.
{58533}{58591}I have no doubt|that in less than ten years,
{58594}{58711}people everywhere will know that|only empathicalism can bring peace.
{58714}{58794}Peace through understanding|is the only real...
{58819}{58881}Well, hello. How are you?
{58884}{58929}Just fine, thank you.|How are you?
{58932}{58970}How long have you been in Paris?
{58973}{59026}This is Mr Avery.|These are my friends.
{59030}{59076}How do you do, boys?
{59079}{59160}Would you mind if I had|my own conversation with this lady?
{59163}{59236}- They don't understand English.|- You were talking English.
{59239}{59325}It's hard to explain,|but it's all part of empathicalism.
{59328}{59394}We don't have to communicate|with words.
{59397}{59486}They understand me through the way|I feel, and the tone of my voice.
{59489}{59570}- Sort of like a dog.|- Obviously, you don't understand.
{59573}{59608}Who's buying the wine?
{59611}{59666}- I am.|- I understand more than you think.
{59669}{59750}- If you're saying that the wine...|- Let me show you something.
{59798}{59886}Gentlemen, may I tell you|that you look like a mess of worms?
{59889}{59977}And that you not only look like,|but you are, a mess of worms.
{59980}{60035}I'll bet you've been here|all these years
{60038}{60105}because if you left,|you'd be picked up for vagrancy.
{60108}{60167}- Bravo.|- Your defence rests.
{60170}{60219}This isn't funny.|You don't belong here.
{60222}{60285}Neither do you,|which brings us to why I'm here.
{60288}{60329}Monsieur, you dance with Mimi?
{60332}{60388}No, thanks, I'm busy.|Didn't Gigi tell you?
{60391}{60470}That's very rude,|refusing to dance with Mimi.
{60473}{60540}Where I come from,|the man asks the girl to dance.
{60543}{60590}You must come from the Stone Age.
{60593}{60696}We think freely here. If a girl wants|to dance with a man, she asks him.
{60699}{60780}We're not inhibited by|outmoded social conventions.
{60784}{60864}I can see that.|Do you ask men to dance with you?
{60880}{60918}Isn't it time you realised
{60921}{61020}that dancing is nothing more than|a form of expression or release?
{61023}{61099}There's no need to be formal|or cute about it.
{61102}{61202}As a matter of fact, I rather feel|like expressing myself now.
{61205}{61254}And I could certainly use a release.
{66330}{66399}You certainly made friends|and influenced people.
{66402}{66454}They're empathicalists.
{66457}{66564}You talk a lot about empathy.|Ever do anything about it yourself?
{66567}{66602}I don't know what you mean.
{66605}{66695}- Why not throw some empathy my way?|- I still don't know what you mean.
{66698}{66757}How do you think I feel|when you don't show up?
{66760}{66790}I'm responsible for you.
{66793}{66882}An empathicalist should feel me|asking for unemployment insurance.
{66885}{66921}Show up where?
{66924}{67015}They've been waiting for you|at Duval's all day.
{67018}{67085}I had no idea. Nobody told me.
{67088}{67154}We've been calling you|on the telephone for hours.
{67199}{67308}I've been at the cafe all day.|I'm terribly sorry.
{67311}{67384}I don't want to sound like|the personnel department,
{67387}{67464}but you ought to get to bed early.|The camera picks up everything.
{67467}{67537}I don't want to spend my life|retouching your pictures.
{67540}{67630}When we're done, you can spend|all your time making small talk.
{67633}{67730}Small talk? I suppose you think|the neckline of a dress
{67733}{67801}makes for world-shaking conversation?
{67804}{67877}Anything you don't understand,|you call small talk.
{67880}{67949}- What do you think of Flostre?|- Don't change the subject.
{67952}{68018}- It's the same subject.|- I haven't met Flostre.
{68021}{68102}You haven't? By now|I thought you two'd be buddies.
{68105}{68200}You don't find Flostre in cafes,|except on special occasions.
{68203}{68281}Not everyone interested in|empathicalism meets him,
{68284}{68351}any more than every American|meets the President.
{68354}{68431}An invitation to Flostre's home|is a great honour,
{68434}{68490}and as hard to get|as an invitation to...
{68493}{68533}The White House.
{68536}{68600}I don't think jokes about Flostre|are funny.
{68603}{68681}No more jokes. But let's be friendly.|We have to work together.
{68684}{68783}You don't have to be friendly|to work together. Acquainted will do.
{68786}{68838}Am I supposed to|go over to Duval's now?
{68841}{68883}I said you'd be there at 10:30am.
{68887}{68930}- I'll be there.|- Promise?
{68933}{68975}I said I'd be there, and I will.
{68978}{69039}- Alright.|- This is where I get off.
{69050}{69114}Wait a minute. Don't go away mad.
{69117}{69212}Can't we walk and get friendly,|or better acquainted, or something?
{69215}{69271}No, thanks. I've got to go to bed.
{69274}{69366}I don't want you spending|your life retouching my pictures.
{69369}{69409}You are mad, aren't you?
{69455}{69497}No, I'm not mad, l...
{69542}{69612}I'm hurt, and disappointed, and...
{69646}{69674}..and mad.
{76576}{76625}What are they doing?|They've been hours.
{76628}{76675}There was a lot to be done.
{76707}{76778}- They don't look happy.|- They don't look unhappy.
{76823}{76871}I can't tell. Do they look pleased?
{76874}{76942}- They don't look displeased.|- Everyone.
{76945}{76998}- The grand finale.|- I'm getting nervous.
{77001}{77052}- You should.|- Sit down.
{77056}{77184}Friends, you saw enter here a waif,|a gamin, a lowly caterpillar.
{77204}{77289}We open the cocoon but|it is not a butterfly that emerges.
{77292}{77405}- It's not?|- No, it is a bird of paradise.
{77431}{77453}Lights!
{77506}{77529}Curtain!
{77997}{78025}Oh...
{78639}{78725}- Beautiful! I don't believe it.|- Maggie, what did I tell you?
{78728}{78792}You look absolutely fabulous.|How does it feel?
{78795}{78844}It feels wonderful, but it's not me.
{78847}{78905}The hair, the dress. It's perfection.
{78908}{78969}You see how much we accomplish|when you appear?
{78972}{79072}Try to stay with us for a while.|Duval shows the collection on Friday.
{79075}{79139}The night before,|we'll introduce you to the press.
{79142}{79208}It is your opportunity.|It will be your evening.
{79212}{79261}- You will be there?|- Yes, of course.
{79264}{79322}Dick, that gives you a week|to photograph her.
{79325}{79398}I want marvellous pictures.|Give me a lot of pizzazz.
{79401}{79487}Take her, and whatever you do,|don't let her out of your sight.
{79506}{79563}Do what I tell you.|Don't worry about it.
{79566}{79662}Here, hold these balloons high|in the air, and when I say "run",
{79665}{79742}run as fast as you can|and don't let the balloons go.
{79745}{79805}Run as fast as I can|and don't let the balloons go.
{79809}{79862}Right. Now, ready?
{79865}{79934}Head up a little. You're so happy.
{79937}{79973}Alright, run!
{79976}{80003}Run!
{80007}{80050}What? Oh, why did I ever...
{80066}{80123}- What's wrong?|- I don't know which way to go.
{80126}{80160}That way.
{80163}{80235}I'm sorry, I'm nervous.|I've never done anything like this.
{80238}{80327}There's nothing to be nervous about.|You're in Paris, the Tuileries.
{80330}{80420}You've got balloons. There's|a sudden shower. You're very happy.
{80423}{80485}- Why am I so happy?|- Because I say you are.
{80523}{80594}That's all you have to know.|You're happy. Now, run!
{80623}{80651}Great. That's great.
{80654}{80681}Now, stop!
{80705}{80732}Wonderful!
{80930}{80975}Now, today you're not happy.
{80978}{81035}- I'm hurt and...|- Right, a creature of tragedy.
{81039}{81109}Heartbroken, suffering.|You're Anna Karenina.
{81122}{81164}Shall I throw myself under the train?
{81167}{81268}We'll see. For now, just wonderful,|noble self-sacrifice.
{81276}{81333}Your lover|has just kissed you goodbye.
{81413}{81477}You may never know that kiss again,|or love again.
{81480}{81533}Marcel, put some tears in her eyes.
{81601}{81643}There are tears in her eyes.
{81646}{81711}Good. You're not only a model,|you're an actress.
{81714}{81843}Jo, give me the works.|Heartbreak, longing, tragedy.
{81846}{81883}Wet your lips.
{81904}{81958}Good. Alright. Now, la steam.
{81961}{81984}La steam!
{81987}{82042}That's great. Just like the movie.
{82045}{82088}Poor Anna Karenina.
{82091}{82127}No, not too much steam.
{82130}{82224}Cut down the steam.|That's wonderful. That's it.
{82295}{82396}Good. Now give her some flowers.|Flowers. Arms full.
{82398}{82467}Alright. More!
{82476}{82535}Alright, Jo, it's spring.|You're in love.
{82538}{82607}Now, turn around. Fabulous!
{82944}{82994}You're walking out of the opera,
{82997}{83065}Ieaving to the passionate|music of Tristan Undlsolde.
{83068}{83121}- You're very unhappy.|- What happened now?
{83124}{83172}A rendezvous at the opera.|Two seats.
{83175}{83221}He didn't show up. You're furious.
{83224}{83324}When I say go, walk down with fire|in your eyes and murder on your mind.
{83327}{83354}Wet your lips.
{83364}{83452}You're lsolde. You're a queen.|Now, go!
{83481}{83540}You're furious at Tristan.
{83543}{83580}That's great.
{83895}{83945}Today,|you're just a simple little girl.
{83948}{84036}You live on the Seine, and you're|trying to catch a fish for lunch.
{84062}{84132}Jo, fish. I want you|to look like you're fishing.
{84135}{84199}I'm trying,|but I've never fished before.
{84202}{84289}That's quite obvious. You might|just as well be flying a kite.
{84316}{84361}Don't look like such an amateur.
{84364}{84397}You're just not fishing.
{84400}{84471}I am, but it's caught on something.
{84474}{84528}Well, give it a yank.
{84531}{84578}Pretend you caught a fish.|Pull it out.
{84613}{84649}Marvellous!
{84733}{84840}- Here's what I want you to be.|- I know. I'm a princess at a ball.
{84843}{84941}The bird is Prince Charming,|turned into a bird by a sorcerer.
{84944}{85003}But we've decided|not to let it spoil the ball
{85006}{85075}and to go on dancing|as if nothing had happened.
{85078}{85115}You've outgrown me.
{85140}{85212}Alright. Now, give him a kiss.
{85223}{85301}He's your Prince Charming, isn't he?|Well, get happy!
{85327}{85360}That's a killer.
{85462}{85517}Alright, Marcel, lights!
{85592}{85658}Jo, where are you?
{85682}{85744}Tell me when you're ready. Say "go".
{85747}{85799}I'm ready. What are you gonna do?
{85802}{85880}Never mind what I'm going to do.|Just say "go".
{85897}{85928}Alright. Go!
{86008}{86081}Holy Moses! You look fabulous!
{86084}{86112}Look, stop.
{86130}{86156}Stop!
{86159}{86256}- I can't stop. Take the picture.|- Stop!
{86260}{86350}I don't want to stop. I like it.|Take the picture.
{86828}{86910}This is your wedding day,|the happiest day of your life.
{86913}{86989}Bells are ringing, flowers blooming,|angels singing.
{86992}{87096}The man you love more than anyone|is inside the church waiting for you.
{87126}{87164}What's the matter?
{87182}{87258}I just feel so dishonest|in this wedding dress.
{87261}{87360}It's not the happiest day of my life.|No one's waiting for me anywhere.
{87363}{87458}But you weren't Anna Karenina.|The bird wasn't Prince Charming.
{87461}{87515}- Please, Dick.|- I don't understand.
{87518}{87555}Yes, I know.
{87729}{87777}But, Padre, we're not here to marry.
{87780}{87866}- Such a beautiful bride.|- This is not my dress.
{87869}{87908}We're here to take pictures.
{88007}{88082}I'm sorry. Perhaps we should've|asked your permission first.
{88085}{88154}No wedding?
{88475}{88552}I'm sorry. I don't know|what's the matter with me.
{88555}{88637}Forget it and relax.|We've been working too hard.
{88640}{88697}I suppose we'll be going home soon?
{88700}{88743}That's it. You're homesick.
{88746}{88839}Well, just this last picture,|then you'll be through.
{88842}{88914}- And then what happens?|- We go home.
{88930}{88954}And then?
{88974}{89006}What do you mean?
{89009}{89050}Will I see you any more?
{89053}{89130}And how! lf you model,|I can get you bookings.
{89133}{89212}- We'd be working together every day.|- I'll model.
{89215}{89260}Good. We'll put you to work.
{89263}{89344}Stand here, please.|There's a good place. Fine.
{89423}{89446}Lovely.
{89449}{89517}Now, tip your head just a little bit.
{89540}{89594}Good. A little smile.
{89730}{89754}Yes?
{89775}{89812}Something is wrong.
{89834}{89873}No. Why?
{89876}{89937}You're the saddest bride|I've ever seen.
{89940}{89992}You look as if you've been jilted.
{89995}{90043}This is your wedding day.
{90046}{90137}The day you've dreamt of.|You're marrying the man you love.
{90140}{90185}The man who loves you.
{90209}{90236}He's the only...
{90262}{90298}And you're...
{90499}{90572}Dick, I thought|it would never happen.
{90607}{90685}I never want to go home.|I love Paris!
{90688}{90784}I love these clothes and|the little church. And I love you.
{90868}{90915}What did you say?
{90918}{90967}I love Paris.
{90970}{91012}That's not what I heard.
{91076}{91109}My, my...!
{91174}{91215}Well, what do you know!
{97840}{97896}Armande, let me see|a breeze in the trees.
{97899}{97965}Not too much.|I don't want a cyclone.
{97968}{98002}Fountains.
{98044}{98112}It's thrilling!|It makes me cry for the Carolines.
{98115}{98174}The correspondent from Pakistan|has accepted.
{98177}{98246}The correspondent from Madrid|will be able to make it.
{98249}{98319}And the man from lstanbul|will be at the presentation.
{98322}{98367}Good. Now, where is Jo?
{98383}{98408}Here she is.
{98411}{98474}Thank heavens.|I thought you'd stand us up again.
{98477}{98539}- How did the wedding pictures go?|- Wonderfully.
{98542}{98585}He is a marvellous photographer.
{98588}{98682}All you do is sit there.|I make my speech to the press,
{98685}{98752}the curtains will open|and you dazzle 'em!
{98755}{98808}- Give 'em the old pizzazz.|- I'll try.
{98811}{98865}I will introduce you to them.
{98868}{98921}Be charming|and answer their questions.
{98924}{99002}- What sort of questions?|- It's remarkably simple.
{99005}{99061}I've written editorials on it|for years.
{99064}{99104}As one lady to another...
{99107}{99167}We ought to look like|one lady to another.
{99170}{99229}They'll want to know|who does your hair,
{99232}{99300}what you eat, drink,|what sheets you sleep on.
{99302}{99370}You're the authority|on how to be lovely.
{99373}{99415}What am I going to tell them?
{99419}{99467}Just listen and repeat after me.
{102983}{103031}Ah, beautiful!
{103097}{103134}These are not my clothes.
{103137}{103220}They were lent for tonight.|I'm being presented to the press.
{103223}{103292}Your picture will be|in all the newspapers?
{103295}{103318}Oh, yes.
{103321}{103391}And they'll ask me|all sorts of questions.
{103423}{103516}I think perhaps you had better stay|here with me, huh?
{103540}{103563}Hello!
{103619}{103676}Don't you remember me?|Jo Stockton?
{103862}{103931}What were they saying about Flostre?
{103934}{104031}That he is speaking at the cafe|and that they are late.
{104334}{104385}Mr Avery will be by in five minutes.
{104388}{104446}Ask him to pick me up at the cafe.
{105326}{105392}Je suis... terribly sorry.
{105395}{105454}- I...|- Quite alright, mademoiselle.
{105458}{105485}You're quite welcome.
{105739}{105775}Now, mademoiselle.
{105778}{105847}I can't believe it.|I thought you'd be old.
{105850}{105912}Well, I mean, a philosopher|and professor.
{105915}{105984}It all suggests age.|I mean, maturity.
{105987}{106033}I'm afraid I've disappointed you.
{106036}{106141}No. There's no reason why someone|brilliant shouldn't be young.
{106166}{106229}I find myself|at an awkward disadvantage.
{106263}{106310}You know who I am.
{106332}{106432}But except that you are|very charming, I don't know you.
{106435}{106523}I'm so excited about meeting you,|I forgot to introduce myself.
{106526}{106600}If only you knew how anxious I am|to talk to you.
{106603}{106668}I came from New York|just to see you.
{106671}{106762}You couldn't have a more loyal|disciple of empathicalism than l.
{106765}{106865}- Than whom?|- I'm sorry. I'm Jo Stockton.
{106885}{106954}I'm enchanted,... Miss Stockton.
{106998}{107104}And since you've come such a long way|to talk with me,
{107107}{107164}by all means, let us talk.
{107305}{107363}There's so much|you can teach us.
{107366}{107412}I may go next year.
{107415}{107496}You must see Greenwich Village.|It's our Left Bank.
{107499}{107575}People there think, and do things.|Useful things.
{107578}{107647}- Do you live in Greenwich Village?|- Of course.
{107650}{107746}Then I will come. Perhaps we can do|useful things together.
{107749}{107828}I'm sure that in all America|there's no empathicalist
{107831}{107869}as charming as you.
{107871}{107925}Well, I hate to throw|a wet blanket...
{107928}{107996}Darling, guess who this is.|You'll never guess!
{107999}{108060}- Your brother?|- Professor Flostre.
{108063}{108169}- This is Dick Avery.|- Professor? I thought you'd be old.
{108172}{108243}- So did l. Aren't you surprised?|- I'm overcome.
{108246}{108334}For you, my dear,|I promise never to grow old.
{108337}{108392}- Come on, Jo.|- What's the matter?
{108395}{108436}We've got to get to Duval's.
{108439}{108505}Must you go?|I was just beginning to know you.
{108508}{108582}Couldn't I stay?|The professor wants to talk to me.
{108585}{108666}- You've heard it all before.|- Have you lost your mind?
{108669}{108737}- We'll talk about that later.|- What are you doing?
{108740}{108809}I've never been so humiliated|in all my life!
{108812}{108886}What's got into you?|Have you any idea...?
{108975}{109023}How could you be so rude?
{109026}{109091}Embarrassing me|in front of Professor Flostre!
{109094}{109146}What am I going to tell him?
{109149}{109247}You're not gonna tell him anything.|You'll never see him again.
{109250}{109322}- Not going to see him again?|- That's what I said.
{109325}{109374}Now, just a moment...
{109377}{109456}I went through all this nonsense|to meet this man.
{109459}{109496}So I could talk to him.
{109538}{109624}I worship everything he stands for.|The way he thinks.
{109627}{109692}You might as well tell me|never to eat again.
{109730}{109785}The Herald Tribune has brought|a correspondent from Sweden.
{109788}{109839}- The more the merrier.|- They are here.
{109842}{109901}Get them quiet, Duval.|I'll be back.
{109904}{109996}When a man looks at a woman|the way Flostre looks at you...
{110123}{110202}If you weren't so serious,|this would be terribly funny.
{110205}{110270}I'll check the lights,|then I make my speech.
{110273}{110305}Everybody, ready!
{110307}{110351}Flostre may be the quiz kid,
{110354}{110420}the greatest philosopher|since Aristotle.
{110423}{110503}But he's also a man.|He's more man than philosopher!
{110506}{110575}His interest in me|is anything but intellectual?
{110578}{110635}He's as interested in your intellect|as I am.
{110668}{110739}Ladies and gentlemen of the press,|my friends.
{110742}{110831}I have asked you here to meet|the woman selected to represent
{110834}{110929}the most discriminating|publication in the world, Quality.
{110932}{110987}Let's forget it|and get this over with.
{110990}{111016}Forget it?
{111019}{111096}You attack Flostre|and the things I believe in.
{111099}{111167}We're fortunate to have found out|these things now.
{111170}{111226}I'm certain|you'll not be disappointed.
{111229}{111302}She is a rare creature...|chosen from hundreds
{111305}{111387}for her appearance, her grace,|her poise,...
{111390}{111456}and her ineffable charm.
{111459}{111516}We can never|reconcile our differences.
{111519}{111557}They are too elemental.
{111560}{111633}This is no time|to discuss our differences.
{111636}{111680}Please, let's get this show on.
{111683}{111754}Yes, the show!|Our personal lives don't matter!
{111757}{111844}- Would you please sit down?|- Leave me alone!
{111937}{112002}May I present the Quality Woman!
{112746}{112805}What does that one say?
{112809}{112894}They all say the same thing.|Everyone in Paris is laughing.
{112897}{112972}- I'm not.|- This is all your fault.
{112975}{113063}I know. I said things|I shouldn't have. She got upset.
{113066}{113137}- Just a lovers' quarrel.|- A what?
{113140}{113208}- You and that girl...|- Why not?
{113211}{113264}Impossible!|You're in the fashion world.
{113267}{113329}We're cold, artificial|and without sentiment.
{113332}{113407}- How can you be in love?|- I'm a black sheep.
{113410}{113487}What about my collection?|Without her I cannot show it.
{113490}{113561}- The gowns were sewn on her!|- I'm facing ruin!
{113564}{113624}She'll show up.|The girl has integrity.
{113627}{113719}She's filled with virtues.|Only she's not wasting them on us.
{113722}{113778}I went to the cafe. She isn't there.
{113781}{113806}So where is she?
{113809}{113875}She's at her hotel,|but she won't take messages.
{113878}{113974}So I bribed the desk clerk into|letting me copy her phone messages.
{114010}{114084}"At 10:15, Dick Avery called."
{114087}{114146}"At 11:30, Dick Avery called."
{114178}{114261}"At 12:16, Professor Flostre called."
{114288}{114349}Lousy, rotten good-for-nothing!
{114384}{114471}"Having an evening of international|philosophy, poetry,
{114474}{114540}song and meditation tonight|at my salon. "
{114543}{114641}"Would be delighted if you would|join us. Emile Flostre."
{114644}{114693}That's where she'll be tonight.
{114696}{114746}Not showing my collection.|I'm ruined.
{114749}{114812}I'll go to Flostre's tonight|and bring her back.
{114815}{114897}And take someone who isn't|emotionally involved. Like me.
{114900}{114929}You'll never get in.
{114932}{115023}Empathicalists have a very firm way|with hostile vibrations.
{115026}{115092}Let's turn into|a couple of friendly vibrations.
{115095}{115174}Until we get in. As they say,|if you can't lick 'em, join 'em.
{115390}{115459}- Do I look grubby enough?|- Yeah. How's the beard?
{115462}{115510}- Full of pizzazz.|- Come on.
{115724}{115747}La.
{115848}{115918}- Florida.|- That's us. De Tallahassee.
{115957}{116010}- Come on, sugar.|- Alright, darlin'.
{116166}{116214}I don't know. I just asked.
{116510}{116582}- What's the matter?|- The song's a bundle of laughs.
{116729}{116791}She stabbed her lover|because she hated him.
{116963}{117028}Now that the poor thing is dead...
{117147}{117203}Now that he's dead, she loves him.
{117405}{117470}This kid's a little confused.
{117632}{117670}Now she's gonna get even.
{117720}{117754}She's gonna kill herself.
{117928}{117990}You can say that again.
{117993}{118014}Hey!
{118143}{118178}Look up the airstay.
{118245}{118282}We're on the wrong floor.
{118465}{118513}Oh-oh, the real Barkers.
{118516}{118555}Now what's this all about?
{118572}{118673}- They are not from Tallahassee!|- They ain't even from Miami.
{118676}{118738}I've never seen these people|in Tallahassee,
{118741}{118816}and I have been in every corner|of Tallahassee.
{118819}{118903}- Is this some sort of a gag?|- I know who he is!
{118994}{119055}She's a fashion editor.|Get 'em out!
{119058}{119121}At once,|or Mr Flostre will hear about this.
{119124}{119205}Now, wait, we're spiritual singers|on a tour and...
{119208}{119267}Now the hostile vibrations|have gone...
{119271}{119319}We are ready for your show.
{119347}{119432}- Command performance!|- Come on, Mama. We're on.
{119436}{119482}Let's give 'em the old pizzazz.
{122675}{122728}Well, Mr Tallahassee, how we doin'?
{122731}{122828}Why, we's the two most friendly|vibrations you ever seen.
{122836}{122891}Hey, diddle diddle,|the cat and the fiddle.
{122894}{122941}The dish ran away with the spoon.
{123012}{123082}Do you know why|a chicken crosses the road?
{123085}{123134}No, why does a chicken|cross the road?
{123137}{123199}- To get to the second floor!|- You is a genius!
{123202}{123248}Roses are red,|the violets are blue,
{123251}{123362}the dresses is gotta be showed.|Let's get this show on the road!
{125349}{125429}Intellectual gratification|is nonexistent.
{125432}{125534}- Only you can fulfil that potential.|- This is it.
{125566}{125633}- Flostre, there you are.|- Professor, we need you.
{125636}{125721}What are you doing here?|You look ridiculous!
{125725}{125810}We've come to see Flostre. Professor,|Maggie and I need guidance.
{125813}{125867}We realise what futile lives we lead.
{125870}{125951}- When did you realise this?|- Today. At about two o'clock.
{125954}{126023}- Just after lunch.|- Professor, don't believe them.
{126026}{126086}We want to sit at your feet|and learn.
{126089}{126152}We sit at your feet,|ignorant, but so willing.
{126155}{126198}You leave his feet alone.
{126201}{126255}Professor, they want to make|a fool of you.
{126258}{126323}- Are you making a fool of him?|- Me?
{126326}{126412}You're making things difficult.|You don't own empathicalism.
{126415}{126464}It's in the public domain.
{126467}{126550}- Why don't you trust these people?|- Because I know them well.
{126553}{126622}I know what they're here for|and it is not guidance.
{126625}{126677}Don't listen to her. She is a child.
{126680}{126724}They came to see me, not you.
{126727}{126792}To get me over to Duval's|to model their collection.
{126832}{126910}- I should have known.|- You should've heard what he said.
{126913}{127004}If we'd come a few minutes later,|you'd have found out for yourself.
{127007}{127045}You've said enough, Mr Avery.
{127048}{127118}Not yet. I haven't told you|what a phoney you are.
{127121}{127205}- Get out of my house.|- I'm not ready to leave.
{127208}{127259}I think I can change your mind.
{127262}{127321}Catch!
{127325}{127366}Oh! Oh, no!
{127385}{127471}Look what you've done!|Bursting in here like a hoodlum.
{127474}{127528}- I never touched him.|- Go away!
{127531}{127595}It's time you woke up|to your responsibilities.
{127598}{127638}Will you please leave?
{127641}{127710}Duval can't show his collection|without you.
{127713}{127772}You can't do this to him,|or to all the others.
{127775}{127801}Hundreds of people.
{127806}{127856}I'm not interested in your people.
{127859}{127961}- Your empathy is a little one-sided.|- Get out!
{127964}{127989}Alright!
{128009}{128051}I assume you mean me, too.
{128070}{128121}On you it looks cute, sugar.
{128241}{128287}Well, you fixed everything!
{128290}{128382}If you can't lick 'em, join 'em|and if you can't join 'em, lick 'em!
{128385}{128443}- Tell Duval I'm sorry.|- Where are you going?
{128446}{128527}There's a plane to New York|at 10:30pm and I'm on it.
{128546}{128612}You can't do this to me! Come back!
{128616}{128720}How dare you leave me in the street|like this! Taxi!
{128972}{129040}- Have they gone?|- They've gone.
{129043}{129118}- And you're still here?|- I'm still here.
{129121}{129166}Are you alright?
{129169}{129196}Well.
{129212}{129296}In fact, I feel wonderful.
{129328}{129383}I can't tell you how sorry I am.
{129387}{129486}I had no idea they were coming,|or what got into Dick.
{129489}{129606}My dear, you mustn't assume guilt|for something that was unavoidable.
{129630}{129669}They've gone.
{129697}{129789}We're here.|That's all that matters now.
{129792}{129858}Nice of you to say so,|but it was me...
{129861}{129924}You have the most penetrating eyes.
{129927}{129988}I can still see them|when I close mine.
{129991}{130032}- Professor?|- Call me Emile.
{130035}{130108}Would there be any value|in my contacting philosophers
{130111}{130183}in cities like|Omaha and Detroit and...
{130186}{130249}and acquainting them|with empathicalism?
{130252}{130329}Your mouth suggests to me|burgundy velvet.
{130332}{130445}Dr Post, who runs a shop I worked in,|has contacts in several universities.
{130448}{130489}Please.
{130553}{130595}Don't say another word.
{130598}{130669}- But I came here to talk.|- We'll talk.
{130672}{130749}- Later.|- Then why don't I come back later?
{130752}{130786}But I need you now.
{130804}{130883}Professor Flostre, I came to talk|with a philosopher.
{130886}{130945}You're talking like a man.
{130948}{131020}But I am a man. And you're a woman.
{131024}{131079}That's not what I came|to talk about.
{131082}{131116}My dear.
{131185}{131256}There is a magical moment|waiting for us.
{131259}{131349}- Don't come any closer.|- Why are you behaving like this?
{131353}{131461}- You come from Greenwich Village.|- I'm moving uptown. Yonkers.
{131464}{131501}But before you move...
{131822}{131905}I cannot keep them waiting.|I must make an announcement.
{131908}{131988}- What shall I say?|- Tell them it was all my fault.
{132265}{132305}Maggie, where's Dick?
{132308}{132392}You told him to go and he went.|He flies at 10:30pm.
{132395}{132422}He mustn't!
{132425}{132476}I knew you would not let us down!
{132479}{132562}- You must do the collection!|- Later. I've got to get to Dick.
{132565}{132632}- We are so late already.|- I want to help.
{132635}{132710}I know how you feel,|even if you think I don't.
{132714}{132821}- I can put myself in your place.|- Maggie, that's empathy!
{132824}{132903}That's what you've been talking|about! Why didn't you say?

{136099}{136194}They promised they'd get my message|to him before he boarded.
{136247}{136275}It's too late.
{136278}{136372}The clock must be fast.|He just hasn't got the message yet.
{136600}{136683}I'm sure he got it.|He didn't want to talk to me.

{137333}{137376}What a beautiful bride!

{137841}{137869}Professor!
{137872}{137914}Keep away from me, you!
{137917}{137996}If you lay one finger on me,|I will call your embassy.
{137999}{138082}I want to apologise.|She wasn't worth fighting about.
{138085}{138148}- Don't tell me I did that!|- You?
{138151}{138207}You didn't even give me a headache.
{138210}{138295}She did this to me, with a statue|that cost 200,000 francs.
{138298}{138377}- She did that?|- I have 18 stitches in my head.
{138380}{138440}- She gave you 18 stitches?|- And a gashed lip.
{138443}{138481}And six stitches in my ear.
{138484}{138556}Professor, I love every broken bone|in your body!
{138682}{138745}Excuse me, Duval. Where is Jo?

{138812}{138879}- Where is she?|- I don't know, she was here...
{138882}{138930}Lettie! Have you seen Jo?
{138933}{139000}No, l...|Oh, Dick, she was just great!
{139003}{139058}Maggie, where's Jo?|Have you seen her?

{139112}{139177}- Did she say where she was going?|- I understand now.
{139180}{139253}She put herself in your place,|so put yourself in her place.
