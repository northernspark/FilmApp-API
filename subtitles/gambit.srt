00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,757
- <i>This is the story of my brave,
foolish friend, Harry Deane.</i>

3
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:29,927
<i>Mr Deane's work
as an art curator in London</i>

4
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:33,380
<i>had gone, he felt,
largely unappreciated.</i>

5
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:37,388
<i>He told me of countless insults
suffered at the hands of his employer,</i>

6
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:42,394
<i>Lionel Shabandar,
media tycoon, art collector</i>

7
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,066
<i>and an absolute brute of a fellow.</i>

8
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:48,146
Do not touch my person. You!

9
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,526
- Yes, my lord?
- Idiot! Give me your boot.

10
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,070
<i>40 years ago,
I'd have called this Shabandar a cad.</i>

11
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:57,780
<i>Now the prevailing parlance
for a fellow of this type</i>

12
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:01,499
<i>is, I believe, shitbag.</i>

13
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,622
Hello.

14
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,749
This bloody thing is not operational.

15
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,672
Ah, well, that's because,
I believe, my lord...

16
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:11,093
Because you believe what,
you steaming turd?

17
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,588
<i>Now he would have his revenge,</i>

18
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,220
<i>for Mr Deane had a plan.</i>

19
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:19,848
<i>To be grandiose, a heist.</i>

20
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,725
<i>To be accurate, a bit of a thieving.</i>

21
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,898
<i>This is where I came in.</i>

22
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:30,355
<i>I am, you see,
a rather capable forger of fine art.</i>

23
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,609
<i>I was pleased my little hobby
might prove of use to him.</i>

24
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:40,198
<i>The plan relied on securing the aid
of one PJ Puznowski.</i>

25
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,376
<i>"Find this Puznowski," Mr Deane told me,</i>

26
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,921
<i>and it would all fall nicely into place.</i>

27
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,508
Excuse me.
We were given to understand

28
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:55,212
that there was an equestrian tourney
in the area.

29
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,219
Well, we got a law attorney,

30
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,552
don't know his religion,
up downtown Alpine.

31
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,513
He's a fairy.

32
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,436
Moved here from Albuquerque,

33
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:09,519
it'll be five, no,
six years ago, come May.

34
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:12,354
Not that I judge.

35
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:16,067
How terribly interesting, but is there
a tournament of some description

36
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,026
with various rowdy goings-on?

37
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:21,158
Rough-riding,
bronc-busting sort of thing.

38
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:25,709
It's a competition.
A test of skill involving farm animals.

39
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,162
Yippee-ai-yay.

40
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,172
<i>Alright, Pecos!</i>

41
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:36,254
<i>This is the West of the Pecos Rodeo,
featuring America's number-one team,</i>

42
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:41,058
<i>Team Ghostrider with Tim Lepard
and his cowboy monkeys.</i>

43
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,638
Go on, Suzie! Go get 'em!

44
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:52,774
<i>And it's brought to you by Charlie
Goodnight and all those good people</i>

45
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,902
<i>down at Charlie Goodnight's
Implements 'n' Feed.</i>

46
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,876
<i>Let's put some hands together
for the monkeys!</i>

47
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:15,468
<i>And first out of the chute
is PJ Puznowski from down Terlingua way.</i>

48
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,759
There.

49
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:21,966
<i>Gonna try to put a rope around Rodney
from the Lazy L Sickle Y Bar Ranch.</i>

50
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,268
<i>And, folks,
Rodney ain't gonna be heppin' any.</i>

51
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:39,863
<i>That's 11.7 for PJ Puznowski!</i>

52
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,411
- That's her.
<i>- Alright, Jammies!</i>

53
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,674
What makes you so certain
she'll be game?

54
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:03,264
Good God, she works in a poultry
processing plant for minimum wage.

55
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,844
- You think she'll turn this down?
- How much are you going to tell her?

56
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,430
Just as much as she needs to know.

57
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,482
That's nice.

58
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:32,620
This is Major Nigel Nelson-Wingate,
King's African Rifles, retired.

59
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,670
- Sunday painter.
- Madam.

60
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:44,260
Now, the simple question is,

61
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:48,890
how would you like to make
half a million pounds sterling?

62
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,017
I have a little plan.

63
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,570
Straight?

64
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:14,336
- Have a good day, sir.
- Shut up.

65
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:31,186
- Sorry, sir.
- Bloody hell, man, be careful!

66
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,059
<i>Shabandar Media.</i>

67
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:37,314
I wonder if you might approve this last
photo layout for the Horse and Hunt.

68
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,024
Is there a problem, sir?

69
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,319
Slazenger, give me a loupe.

70
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,794
<i>Haystacks, Dusk.</i>

71
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,506
Get me Harry Deane.

72
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,847
Old man just called me up.

73
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,307
Yes, he's expecting you.

74
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,556
- No, no, no.
- Oh, I am sorry, sir.

75
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:17,308
What? Come in.
Have them proof it quick as possible.

76
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,020
We'll try and get it into next month's.
Deane, sit down.

77
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:25,403
Have a look at these.

78
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,739
I've sent the plane
to collect this woman.

79
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,662
Arrives at Heathrow in about an hour.
You'll pick her up.

80
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,991
Interesting. Oh, I see, the painting.

81
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:37,920
- A reproduction, though, in my opinion.
- Bloody hell. Based on what?

82
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:41,544
On the fact that it's hanging
on the wall of a caravan, sir, in Texas.

83
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:46,754
Yes, precisely.
But whose caravan, you plank?

84
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:52,096
- The cowgirl, sir.
- Puznowski, Deane.

85
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:56,601
PJ Puznowski. Think, man.

86
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,232
You stupid bastard, what!

87
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,616
Welcome to London.

88
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,373
Before we throw you
into the thick of it,

89
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,625
I should give you a bit
of the history.

90
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,874
Monet's Haystacks.

91
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:29,171
On September 15th, 1891, during
the course of one very productive day,

92
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:31,097
the master Impressionist

93
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,550
<i>finished two oii paintings:</i>

94
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,682
<i>"Haystacks, Dawn",
"Haystacks, Dusk".</i>

95
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:40,231
<i>"Haystacks, Dawn" was traded
amongst various private collectors</i>

96
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,558
<i>over the years.</i>

97
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,020
<i>"Haystacks, Dusk" was put on display
in Paris at the Jeu de Paume.</i>

98
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:48,277
<i>That is,
until the Nazi occupation of 1941.</i>

99
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,953
<i>"Haystacks, Dusk"
was carted off to Carinhall,</i>

100
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,119
<i>the private residence
of Air Marshal Hermann Göring,</i>

101
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:01,078
<i>for the delectation of his eyes only.</i>

102
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:05,382
<i>In 1945, Carinhall is overrun
by the first division of Patton's army,</i>

103
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,208
<i>the Big Red One.</i>

104
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:14,183
<i>The point platoon is led
by Sergeant Brian "Bulldog" Puznowski,</i>

105
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,635
<i>the Killer of Kilgore, Texas.</i>

106
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,186
Your grandfather.

107
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,898
For the next 67 years,
the whereabouts of <i>Haystacks, Dusk</i>

108
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:25,352
has proved one of the art world's
most tantalising mysteries.

109
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,187
And what is all this to Shabandar?

110
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,194
A man of outsized appetites
and enormous enthusiasms,

111
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:33,948
and no few eccentricities;
an avid nudist, a case in point.

112
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:37,663
Owing to his considerable fortune
and my not inconsiderable knowledge,

113
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,117
he has assembled
the most important collection

114
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,749
of Impressionist masterpieces
in private hands.

115
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,421
The prize? <i>Haystacks, Dawn.</i>

116
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:49,627
<i>Acquired at auction 20 years ago
in spirited bidding.</i>

117
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:53,634
The bid is with the gentleman
on the aisle. The bid is £8 million.

118
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,557
- Good heavens.
- I have eight and a quarter.

119
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:59,227
The bid is with the gentleman
on my left.

120
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:04,474
The bid is against you, sir. The bid
is eight and a quarter million pounds.

121
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:07,819
<i>Shabandar rolled
all his competitive impulses into a ball</i>

122
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:11,273
<i>and outbid his great rival,
Akira Takagawa.</i>

123
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:15,573
<i>He purchased the painting
for £11 million.</i>

124
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,910
His ownership of the one has merely
whet his appetite for the other.

125
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,917
For years now, Shabandar
has been seeking Haystacks, Dusk

126
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,124
with a passion
bordering on monomania.

127
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:30,675
When he saw that photograph,

128
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,755
Shabandar conducted his own
investigation into your family history.

129
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,716
Best to let the fish
work the hook in himself, eh, Major?

130
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,722
Much the best, Mr Deane.

131
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:42,224
He will want to negotiate
the price with you.

132
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:45,182
You must stick at 12 million.

133
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,142
Pounds.

134
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:51,321
He'll pay it,
no matter how much he protests.

135
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:56,986
Be firm. Be polite, but firm.

136
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,033
He will try to charm you.
He will try to impress you.

137
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,535
- Ms Puznowski!
- He will try to...

138
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,871
An honour! Welcome, welcome.

139
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:10,423
Painting in the gallery, men.

140
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,593
I knew a Koznowski once,
charming man, no relation I suppose.

141
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:17,923
Baron Koznowski. Quite the equestrian.
Man had horse blood in his veins.

142
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,638
This way, please.

143
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:23,596
Right, let's take a look, shall we?

144
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,726
Mere formality, of course.

145
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,899
Oh, yes.

146
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,436
So...

147
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,446
What do you think, Deane?

148
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:41,746
- Yes, I'll need a few moments, sir.
- Oh, yes. Quite.

149
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,329
You may not realise it,
Ms Puznowski,

150
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:49,671
but Harry Deane knows Monet
like I know...

151
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:54,045
Actually, I don't know anything
quite like that.

152
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,925
The artist has used a light ground
true to Monet's habit.

153
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:01,850
The palette is very limited,
no blacks or browns.

154
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:06,054
Cerulean blue and cadmium yellow
to achieve his broken colour.

155
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:10,142
And unlike the heartbreaking fraud
perpetrated on the Austrians,

156
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,147
the signature is correct.

157
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:18,825
It is Monet and it is very fine indeed.

158
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,824
And that, Mr Deane,
is good enough for me.

159
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,869
Shall we discuss terms?

160
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,721
System armed.

161
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,392
System armed.

162
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:07,331
- Hello, kitty.

163
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,870
Your wages.

164
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:15,999
£500,000 and your ticket home.
First class, of course.

165
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:19,882
No, no, no. No, no, no.
Please, do not thank us.

166
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:23,591
It is the Major and I who should be
thanking you for the self-possession,

167
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:27,849
the good humour and the élan with which
you played your small but vital part.

168
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:31,056
- Eh, Major?
- Hear, hear, sir. Jolly well played.

169
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:34,609
We should be arriving
at Heathrow in mere minutes.

170
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:35,776
<i>Mr Deane.</i>

171
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:40,573
Mr Deane? Mr Deane.

172
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,535
Shouldn't have to tell her
any more than that.

173
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,080
Quite right.
But you will have to talk to her.

174
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,871
Hmm.

175
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:59,000
Back in a flash.

176
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:06,555
<i>Mr Deane, for all his talents,
was given to one particular flaw.</i>

177
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,761
<i>He saw the world
as he wished to see it.</i>

178
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:15,271
<i>But, as we know, an optimist is simply
a man who hasn't heard the news.</i>

179
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,144
<i>As my time in the African Rifles
had taught me,</i>

180
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:22,323
<i>one ignored the elephant in the room
at one's peril.</i>

181
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:26,028
Half a million pounds sterling.
Half a million...

182
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,829
- Hello.
- I believe the lady said get lost.

183
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:35,416
I'll take the chunky one!

184
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,374
Gonna open a can of whup-ass
on you now.

185
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,674
Major, for heaven's sake,
just be gentle.

186
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,926
- I'm trying to get...
- No, that's enough.

187
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,600
- Those people are barbarians.
- Other countries, other customs.

188
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:53,347
- How are we going to meet this woman?
- I remember one night in Botswana...

189
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,807
She's surrounded
by a Cro-Magnon Swiss Guard.

190
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:59,690
This wasn't the plan, Major.
How are we going to get back on plan?

191
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:02,613
You boys OK, huh?

192
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,816
Faces still on right ways round?

193
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:09,037
Yes, thank you.
All present and correct.

194
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:12,536
I do apologise on Merle.
He just loves a brawl.

195
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:15,539
Nose been broke so many times,
he had the cartilage taken out

196
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,087
so there wouldn't be downtime
between bar fights.

197
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:22,425
An expedient we might consider
if we spend much more time in Texas.

198
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,337
Heigh ho, friend.
I wouldn't recommend it.

199
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:30,095
May I draw your attention to the matter
which brought us here to meet you?

200
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:33,303
Sure.

201
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:38,392
So you're saying
that's like $800,000 American? Wow!

202
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,693
We don't have the money yet.

203
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:44,363
- But it's gonna work out, right?
- As long as we stay on plan.

204
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:47,783
Sounds like you really wanna
stick it to this guy. Here we are.

205
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:52,246
<i>Inside is a man who weighs half a ton.</i>

206
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:56,118
<i>Michael was fork-lifted onto a stretcher
for transporting killer whales.</i>

207
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,999
Shame! Shame!

208
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,082
Hey, Grandma! Alright, well, here it is.
Take your pick.

209
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:05,008
- Plenty of walls to choose from.
- Good morning.

210
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,178
Too fat!

211
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,055
Major, if you'd like to set
your camera up over there.

212
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:16,555
Perhaps if your grandmother
would move over for a moment.

213
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:22,064
Grandma Merle, these nice people
wanna take a picture here in the house.

214
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,271
Is everyone in this state named Merle?

215
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:27,524
- There you go.
- Good God. Is she unwell?

216
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,110
Oh, no, she's fine.
Grandma Merle just chews.

217
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:33,992
Ms Puznowski, could you slide
a little closer to your grandmother?

218
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:39,540
Ready, ladies? Say cheese.

219
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:45,675
<i>Hard facts,
honest reporting. Shabandar.</i>

220
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,424
His door is rather firmly shut
at the moment.

221
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:51,756
- Would you care to wait?
- Yes, thank you, I'll wait.

222
00:18:56,594 --> 00:19:00,849
<i>Lionel Shabandar
explains his formula for success</i>

223
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:04,185
<i>in his startling
new autobiography, "Me".</i>

224
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:12,493
<i>Welcome to the jungle.

225
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,570
Huh!

226
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,583
<i>Shabandar Media. Creating...</i>

227
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,224
Go right in, Mr Deane.

228
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,429
- Your lordship...
- Yes, Deane?

229
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,522
That's a very nice suit, sir.

230
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,854
- What?
- Nothing.

231
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:52,613
I was leafing through the advance
on the <i>Horse and Hunt</i> the other day.

232
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:55,787
- The layout pages.
- Why on earth were you doing that?

233
00:19:56,946 --> 00:20:00,667
Well, as a matter of fact, it's...
Well, why be coy?

234
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:04,791
It's a simple explanation,
so simple, in fact, that I...

235
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:08,716
Well, it's my favourite of your...
of your publications, sir.

236
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,803
Our publications
here at Shabandar Media.

237
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:17,884
Without wanting to overstate things,
I would say it may be my favourite...

238
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:23,098
publication ever, without the...
qualification of Shabandar Media,

239
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,557
et cetera, et cetera.

240
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,143
- Do you ride?
- Good God, no.

241
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,603
That is, I have ridden.

242
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:31,690
A birthday party. They had ponies.
Little Shetland ponies.

243
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:34,195
We traipsed around
in a circle in the garden.

244
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:37,495
I was, oh, six, seven years old.

245
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:41,373
It was my friend
Bobby Montaigne's birthday party.

246
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,913
He's a speech pathologist now.

247
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:47,372
And how well I remember it.
Made a deep impression, sir.

248
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:50,880
- Is there something I can help with?
- Yes, sir, there is. Thank you.

249
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,220
You see, I snuck an advance peek,
as I said, at the Horse and <i>Hunt.</i>

250
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:57,720
I was struck most particularly
by the piece on this PJ Puznowski,

251
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,846
the Texan horse person.

252
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:04,146
Equestrienne,
not a mutant or a mythical creature.

253
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:09,986
One imagines a... well, the bosom
of a woman and the hindquarters of...

254
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,279
- Did you happen to see it, sir?
- Yes.

255
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,865
I was struck by one particular picture.

256
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,157
<i>Haystacks, Dusk.</i>

257
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:20,579
- Yes. Exactly, sir.
- A reproduction, of course.

258
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:24,375
Really? You think so, sir?
Based on what, if I may ask?

259
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:28,830
Based on the fact that it was hanging on
the wall of a bloody caravan in Texas.

260
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,627
There is that.

261
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,130
- Is that all?
- Yes, sir.

262
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,296
Thank you.

263
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:41,426
But shouldn't we check, do research?
I could put together a memo.

264
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:45,184
- One of your memos, yes.
- The painting is so rarely reproduced,

265
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,640
I don't even know
if I've seen a reproduction.

266
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:51,273
And it's the very incongruity of it,
hanging, as you so discerningly...

267
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:54,731
Fine. Ring this woman up
and ask if she has an original Monet

268
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:59,570
on the wall in Shitbird, Texas.

269
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,249
- Did he bite, our little fishy?
- He's not hooked yet.

270
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:08,495
- But he's circling the bait.
- Not sure I follow you, old thing.

271
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:11,748
He's seen the painting
and he's considering being intrigued.

272
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:14,175
- Considering?
- Considering being, yes.

273
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,378
- Where's the girl?
- In a hotel in Dallas.

274
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:20,260
- Why is she in a hotel in Dallas?
- The passport office is there.

275
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,639
It turns out that the dear girl's
never been out of the country.

276
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:28,644
Now, ordinarily, a passport takes
eight weeks, but they can expedite.

277
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:32,189
Pay a couple of hundred pounds,
they'll hurry it along.

278
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:36,239
That's very nice of them.
Couple of hundred.

279
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,315
Right.

280
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:43,950
Your post, Mr Deane.

281
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,792
It is extraordinary, isn't it?

282
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:56,877
Well, it's very amusing if you should
turn out to have been right.

283
00:22:56,959 --> 00:23:01,055
I am here to amuse, sir.
So shall we bring her in?

284
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:05,636
- <i>Who?</i>
- The cowgirl, sir. PJ Puznowski.

285
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:09,143
Her grandfather, and all this
confirmed in the US military records,

286
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,564
Bulldog Puznowski.

287
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:13,560
Yes, yes, I read the memo,
but why would I bring her in?

288
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:17,146
<i>If the painting is real
and if she wants to sell it,</i>

289
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,859
<i>I certainly don't want to seem
overly eager. No, no, no, no.</i>

290
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:23,990
Ring her up and tell her
if ever she finds herself in London,

291
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:27,198
I'd be happy to carve out
a few minutes for a chat.

292
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:30,034
<i>Let her invest
in the deal coming off.</i>

293
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:33,792
- I see, sir. It's brilliant.
- Nonsense, Deane. It's elementary.

294
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,836
- Prat.
- Wanker.

295
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:40,966
- Unrestricted economy fare.
- That's what they call it, sir.

296
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:44,260
Of course, they use the word "economy"
with a certain looseness.

297
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,344
Looseness? It's a positive leap
of the poetic imagination.

298
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,269
Very good, sir. Well put.

299
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:51,939
- Still, we can't count our pennies.
- Oh, no, sir.

300
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:54,767
Not with millions in the offing.

301
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:58,195
- There she is.
- Great to meet you. You take care.

302
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,949
Hey, boys! Hi!

303
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:07,408
Wow. That was a very comfortable flight.

304
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,372
Excellent. Welcome to London.

305
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,952
Thank you. Oh, thank you, Major.

306
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,588
Yes, still holding.

307
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:20,167
Can't see her today? Any time today?

308
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,424
At the end of the day, could he see her?
Needn't take long.

309
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:29,219
No, I understand. No, I understand.

310
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,303
Right. Cheers.

311
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:01,508
Hey! Is this bothering you?

312
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,754
Not at all.

313
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,805
- I'm going to make some tea.
- OK.

314
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:14,814
- What you got hanging here?
- Sorry?

315
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,767
On your wall. Is this a Monet?

316
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,022
Careful.

317
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:25,783
Alfred Sisley. They were contemporaries.

318
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:31,451
It's of his son, Pierre.

319
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,204
The boy was ten at the time, I think.

320
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:37,415
Sure is small.

321
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:42,295
It cost me a ridiculous amount of money.
Rather put me in a hole.

322
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:46,341
I like it.

323
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,131
It's nice.

324
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,140
It's very beautiful.

325
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,609
- Good morning.
- You know what time it is, mate?

326
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,732
Yes, Mr Knowles. It's just coming...

327
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,899
Morning.

328
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:14,657
Psst. Come on, wake up.
He can see us now.

329
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:19,291
<i>Creating and distributing news,
sports and entertainment.</i>

330
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:22,623
- Come on, let's go.
<i>- It's a jungle out there.</i>

331
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,710
<i>The lion's share of the world's media.</i>

332
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:29,464
<i>Shabandar. Hear us roar.</i>

333
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:33,847
- Let me do the talking.
- Sure.

334
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,348
Ms Puznowski.

335
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,521
- Howdy.
- Delighted to meet you.

336
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,724
Good grief, Deane.
What happened to you?

337
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:43,318
A fellow in the pub expressed
a preference for Matisse over Cézanne.

338
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,737
Had to set him straight.
I'm joking, of course.

339
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:48,441
Love Matisse. Use of colour.

340
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:52,904
No, bent down to pick something up,
bookshelf in the way. Hello, bango.

341
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:55,284
So, shall we sit?

342
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:57,617
So, how do you find London?

343
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:01,124
Well, everybody knows
the answer to that one.

344
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:03,046
You turn right at Greenland.

345
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,883
Indeed. And where are you staying?

346
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:11,510
Er, well, one of them,
erm, big hotels downtown.

347
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:14,387
I can't remember the name of it.
You remember, Harry?

348
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,809
- Connaught.
- Me neither.

349
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:18,266
- But it's one of them big ones.
- The Connaught.

350
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,814
We spoke about the Connaught Hotel.

351
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:26,070
That's a stupid name.
Staff seems pretty can-do.

352
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,239
You certain about the Connaught?

353
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,986
- Sorry?
- It's fine, I suppose.

354
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:33,285
But I'll make a few calls,
get our friend in at the Savoy.

355
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,829
- I much prefer it.
- Sir, there's really no need.

356
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:39,450
Let him do it, Harry. I'm sure
the service is plenty good there, too.

357
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:42,207
Good anywhere, I reckon,
if you got the do-re-mi.

358
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,954
And I don't mind shelling it out.

359
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:48,918
I guess Harry here told you about
this here painting I'm aiming to unload.

360
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:52,972
Ms Puznowski feels that in light of
the precedential value of the piece...

361
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,140
You're hardly her agent, Deane.

362
00:27:55,215 --> 00:28:00,312
And anyway, Ms Puznowski seems
perfectly capable of expressing herself.

363
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:03,061
- Well, yes, sir.

364
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,484
Yes, sir. English is my mother tongue.

365
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:08,403
But you don't have to Ms Puznowski me.

366
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,822
No, you can call me PJ. Or Jammies.

367
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:14,493
That's my rodeo handle.
Or Philomena, which is my real name.

368
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:18,448
Well, thank you, PJ.
And you may call me Lionel.

369
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,033
Let's hope doing business
on a first-name basis

370
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:24,495
will be conducive to plain speaking
and clear understanding.

371
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:27,252
Amen to that, Lionel.

372
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:29,379
Well, then, let's get to it.

373
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,711
I want £12 million
for this here picture.

374
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,342
That's 6,000 tons
if I've clone my math right.

375
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:38,016
And maybe you'd like to throw in
a nice four-by-four to haul it off in,

376
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:42,096
with an auto tranny, a CD deck
and graduated tint on the windshields.

377
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:43,806
Please and thank you.

378
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:48,311
Well, that's marvellous,
and tell me, PJ,

379
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,863
what makes you think
this painting is worth £12 million?

380
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:58,412
Well, Lionel, first off, it's oil.
Ain't it, Harry?

381
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:01,661
Indeed, the medium is oil,
and its provenance is promising.

382
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:09,840
But I would like to take it to your
country house to compare it to its mate.

383
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:12,506
- Is it being shipped in?
- Arrives Tuesday.

384
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,678
You can run it up to the house.

385
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,051
We'll take a look at it
at the gala on Wednesday.

386
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,553
- You've never been to the house.
- No, sir, no. I...

387
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:22,227
I have an annual party
up at the estate.

388
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:25,806
That sounds nice. That's another thing
I got going in my favour.

389
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,687
You've got this other Haystacks,

390
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:31,191
and the man ain't churning 'em out,
what with his being dead an' all.

391
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:36,442
So, looks like if you want the set,
I got you by the short and curlies.

392
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:39,870
I don't think it's a situation
of one party trying to subdue the other.

393
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:43,666
Nonsense. It's a pleasure doing business
with someone who knows her position

394
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,209
and is able to clearly set it out.

395
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:51,424
Unfortunately I have
another appointment at 11 o'clock.

396
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,717
But I believe this is worth pursuing.

397
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:57,888
Let's see if we mightn't find
some common ground.

398
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:00,591
Why, thank you. A gentleman.

399
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:03,598
Thank you.

400
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:06,647
I'm booked the rest of the day
and I have a business dinner.

401
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:10,693
But a thought occurs to me. Perhaps
you might be my dinner companion.

402
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:14,738
We'd have time to talk and you might
even help me with a business matter.

403
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,861
Thank you. That would be delightful.

404
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:21,867
Don't bother yourself, Deane.
I'm sure PJ and I can handle things.

405
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,822
To plain speaking.

406
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,782
- Yes, sir.
<i>- Going down.</i>

407
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:28,289
- Shall we say eight o'clock?
- Sure.

408
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,620
Pick you up at...?

409
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:32,422
- The Savoy.
- Why not?

410
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:42,933
<i>As I drove the two of them
to the most expensive hotel in London,</i>

411
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:46,387
<i>I was rather taken by Ms Puznowski.</i>

412
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:52,193
<i>Her invigorating lack of decorum
would have enraptured my younger self.</i>

413
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,941
<i>Still, for the successful execution
of the plan,</i>

414
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:59,400
<i>Mr Deane would require a firm hand
to bring her into line.</i>

415
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:03,283
<i>I won't deny
I doubted the strength of his wrists.</i>

416
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,660
I don't think
I need to remind you, do I,

417
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:07,616
of the consequences
of room service?

418
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,248
- Uh-huh.
- This place is absurdly expensive.

419
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:12,830
Well, this was all your idea.

420
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:16,008
- Not your actually staying here.
- It's not my fault neither.

421
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:19,591
We told him our story and either
we keep laying on the bamboozlement

422
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,592
or we might as well
pack it in and go home.

423
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:24,891
<i>Mamacita!</i> I bet this place has cable.

424
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:27,803
What are you doing?

425
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:31,477
The Major gave me a rag to dry this

426
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,355
and, good God,
I believe it has motor oil on it.

427
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:38,989
Hello. Do you have a single room?

428
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:43,319
Very, very small. Tiny, in fact.
Just for one evening.

429
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:45,450
Certainly, sir. I'll just take a look.

430
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:49,830
Not even the whole evening necessarily.
We could just use it for...

431
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:53,253
We are rather hemmed in
at the moment, sir.

432
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:58,630
All I see for this evening is a very
comfortable suite overlooking the river.

433
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,551
We'll take it.

434
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,345
Hold on. What's the tariff?

435
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:06,426
Hoss, if you're gonna nickel-and-dime
me, we can call this whole thing off.

436
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:10,433
- I'm beginning to have second thoughts.
- Why would you have second thoughts?

437
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:12,731
There's moral issues. Right and wrong.

438
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:14,308
What would my momma have said

439
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:17,691
if she saw me deceiving somebody
with you and your little Major?

440
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:21,069
The Major has made quite a mess here.
It's really embarrassing.

441
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:24,277
- Don't you feel a little ashamed?
- I'm not remotely ashamed.

442
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,657
- Just run that through.
- Sir, I already have.

443
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:30,707
There seems to be a problem with this
card. Perhaps you've exceeded the limit.

444
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:35,709
Bloody hell. Alright, try the... This
is a mistake. Try the American Express.

445
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,586
I don't know why I worry.
You ain't up to it anyway.

446
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:41,760
- You or the Major.
- The Major is quite capable.

447
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:44,213
Well!
- What? What's the laugh for?

448
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:47,220
Laughing at the Major?
He's handled better than you.

449
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,768
He's been in any number
of sticky spots in and out.

450
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:52,434
Should you choose to play coy
this late in the game,

451
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:53,764
the Major would be aroused

452
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:56,642
and I could not be held responsible
for the consequences.

453
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:59,649
From what I've seen,
ain't nothin' gonna arouse the Major.

454
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:02,777
Very good, sir.
This one worked brilliantly.

455
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:06,486
There you are. That's room 344.

456
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:10,907
This evening, it is very important
to stay on topic. Keep it businesslike.

457
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:14,084
The man is not above mixing
the professional with the personal

458
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,878
- to get what he wants.
- What's that supposed to mean?

459
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:20,674
Don't make me say it.
The man is... Well, he's a cad.

460
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:23,878
He's up to something.
He excluded me from your little date.

461
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:29,467
Hell, maybe I don't mind being seduced,
chased after by a multi-zillionaire.

462
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:31,889
I don't know,
that don't sound so terrible.

463
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:35,893
What a depraved point of view.
The man's money makes him attractive?

464
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:38,816
Yeah. Momma always called
money and manners

465
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,815
the pork and beans of personality.

466
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:44,068
- What an odd woman.
- There we are. 344, right?

467
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:48,152
And I beg you,
do not abuse the minibar.

468
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,578
Is that...

469
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,701
Good God!

470
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:01,206
- It's a Ming.
- Harry.

471
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,461
Key.

472
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,886
- That's your side.
- This is a real nice car, Lionel.

473
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:12,059
- It's nicer than my house.
- Indeed.

474
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,010
Would you classify this as a limo?

475
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:15,892
Well, I suppose you could.

476
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:28,200
Shabandar.

477
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:29,993
Yes. Good to see you.

478
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:34,915
Martin Zaidenweber,
this is PJ Puznowski.

479
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:39,166
- This is her? It's so nice to meet you.
- It's very nice to see you too.

480
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:43,044
- Are you excited to be here in London?
- I'm so excited. It's my first time.

481
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:45,251
No! No, come on.

482
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:49,383
Now, I have heard about this painting.
I mean, what a story.

483
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:52,056
Almost incredible. Almost incredible.

484
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:54,134
I thought it'd be good
for you two to meet.

485
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,219
Martin will be examining your painting.

486
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:58,522
He's going to curate
my private collection.

487
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,224
<i>Ja.</i>

488
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,273
Wow. I thought that
that's what Harry did.

489
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:08,357
For the moment,
but the man's a bit of an idiot.

490
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,364
- Don't you think?
- No, no, no, Shabandar.

491
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,241
No. Harry is a good man.

492
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,494
Not much of an eye, but a good man.

493
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:21,586
I am for five years a director
of the Kunst Museum in Köln.

494
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:26,918
<i>Und</i> before that I curated the collection
of Baron Thyssen-Bornemisza.

495
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,631
But the Baron's collection is...
heavily Flemish.

496
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:38,225
Titian, Rubens,
all the women, so <i>saftig und heftig.</i>

497
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:44,106
I mean, how many years can you spend
looking at the Walloons, huh?

498
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:46,653
Anyway, now I prefer the Impressionists.

499
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:50,115
<i>Und</i> I'm now considered
as the top man on Monet.

500
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,906
Say, your English
is pretty darn good there, Martin.

501
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,363
I mean, for someone
from the country of Germany.

502
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:59,871
Oh, thank you. Well,
I speak eight languages fluently.

503
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:04,204
<i>Und</i> I'm internet-savvy, but you have
to be these days, don't you think?

504
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,961
I pluck chickens,
so there ain't a lot of call for me

505
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,543
to be traipsing around
tweetin' and bloggin'.

506
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:11,594
<i>Ja, ja.</i>

507
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:16,096
I'm unfamiliar with this expression,
"I pluck chickens".

508
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:19,219
Anyway, tell me this remarkable thing.

509
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:22,146
This painting was hanging
always in your house,

510
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:25,066
ever since you can remember,
even as a little kinder?

511
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:28,774
Yep.

512
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,620
Hmm!

513
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:45,204
Bloody hell.

514
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:52,461
- So, Harry's out on his butt, huh?
- Harry is, as you say, out on his butt.

515
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,714
He's a bit of a disappointment, really.

516
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,262
Something a little desperate
about the man.

517
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,560
- I don't know.
- A little shifty, a little weak.

518
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:01,978
Not that bright.

519
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:05,227
I like to look a man in the eye,
"Lionel Shabandar, how do you do?"

520
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:08,651
"This is what I should like. What do
you fancy?" Just have out with it.

521
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:12,277
It's easier to live up to that when
you're rich and can call all the shots.

522
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:15,575
Character is tested in many ways.
Money brings its own burdens.

523
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:20,156
You, I'm certain, will pass every test.
Deane, I don't know.

524
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,037
I think maybe
you're just not looking deep enough.

525
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:27,212
Like Momma said, if you can't tell the
difference between a pig and a javelina,

526
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:30,757
well, you could lose a big old chunk
out of your ass.

527
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,593
Indeed.

528
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:40,384
<i>Mr Deane was a proud man
in a difficult moment.</i>

529
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:44,188
<i>His credit exhausted,
his coffers near empty,</i>

530
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:48,062
<i>he was forced to contemplate
desperate measures.</i>

531
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:52,813
<i>Yet he could allow no chink
to appear in the plan.</i>

532
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:56,776
<i>And though his accomplice might seem,
shall we say, less than perfect,...</i>

533
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:00,905
<i>- ..He would maintain control.</i>

534
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:05,367
<i>These are the moments
that try men's souls.</i>

535
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:07,711
So how is His Lordship this evening?

536
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,538
- He's...
- No problems?

537
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:13,125
- He wasn't rude or bullying, I hope.
- No, he was polite enough.

538
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:16,087
Hey, Harry, what are you doing
with all your quarters?

539
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:19,548
These, madam, are pounds and pence,
not quarters.

540
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:23,261
- Just putting my affairs in order.
- Harry Deane, are you tapped out?

541
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:28,600
Hardly. I do this periodically
so as to have use of the jar.

542
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:31,309
I bag the coins
and donate the proceeds to charity.

543
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,860
Uh-huh.

544
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:37,861
Tea?

545
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:43,496
So where do we stand with
our little affair, scheme, programme?

546
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,871
You know, hoss,
I don't think it's gonna work out.

547
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,835
What? Nonsense.
Everything's going according to plan.

548
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:52,585
We have the painting,
or so Shabandar believes.

549
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:55,793
And I, my dear, have
that credulous boob's confidence.

550
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,752
On plan, don't you understand?

551
00:38:57,836 --> 00:39:01,340
Well, then, I guess it's just me
having second thoughts, then.

552
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:04,972
Second thoughts? Well,
it's a little late for that, young lady.

553
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:08,021
- Don't young lady me, hoss.
- Don't you hoss me, young lady.

554
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:09,143
That is it.

555
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:14,486
I have invested thousands of pounds
in this little caper of ours,

556
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:19,362
not to mention the Major, who has
painted his heart, his soul, his guts

557
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,317
into his forgery of Haystacks, Dusk.

558
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:25,281
You call the Major, tell him about your
second thoughts, your silly little...

559
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,116
What is it anyway?
Cold feet, moral qualms again?

560
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,371
Yeah, that's part of it.

561
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,670
Besides, the man
is a cold-blooded, heartless bully.

562
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,339
- I happen to think he's quite charming.
- Charming?

563
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:39,386
He's charming in a thoroughly reptilian,
repulsive way. Repulsively charming.

564
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,088
But you fail to see his manners
are completely ersatz.

565
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,215
I knew you were naive and provincial...

566
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:47,894
And look at you,
trash-talkin' my origins!

567
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:51,599
I respect your origins,
your entire double-wide way of life,

568
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:53,854
but it does leave you vulnerable to...

569
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:57,233
Leaves me vulnerable? I don't know
how to tell you this, Harry.

570
00:39:57,312 --> 00:40:00,532
- But you're fired.
- Oh, I'm fired?

571
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:02,609
- Yep.
- Very amusing.

572
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:06,071
Let me remind you who's running
this little enterprise, madam. Moi.

573
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:09,784
And it is you who are fired!
Except you're not.

574
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:14,417
In clue course, when I have authenticated
the Major's beautiful work, then,

575
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:17,499
then we shall discuss
the termination of your employment

576
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,380
and come to some understanding

577
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:23,509
as to how to bear the onus
of your ridiculous expenses.

578
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:28,344
Wrong, hoss. Wrong, wrong and wrong.

579
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:32,272
You are fired, by Lionel,
cos he told me hisself.

580
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:35,396
He introduced me to some
stuck-up heinie, Martin Zaidenweber,

581
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:36,647
who's getting your job

582
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:40,276
and you won't be authenticating
your dumb old hay painting.

583
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:42,733
So I'm going back to the Savoy
to stay the night

584
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:45,568
and I might just order up
some surf 'n' turf.

585
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:49,031
And tomorrow I'm going to Texas,
get my job back at the chicken plant.

586
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,660
It ain't no fault of mine

587
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,664
that your whole cockamamie scheme
just went blooey.

588
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,432
Hmm!

589
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:29,161
- Zaidenweber.

590
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:33,325
Hmm. It's a little late
to apologise now.

591
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:40,541
How could he? Zaidenweber.

592
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:43,797
The man is a... Admittedly he knows
his way around the Walloons.

593
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:47,631
But when it comes to the Impressionists,
the man is a hopeless ignoramus.

594
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:50,593
This would be comical
if it weren't actually dangerous.

595
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:52,222
I refer not just to my nose,

596
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:55,555
which this time I fear
may be well and truly broken.

597
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:58,357
Perhaps since our little caper
is far from over,

598
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:01,653
perhaps we should consider
removing the cartilage.

599
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:04,948
Don't be an ass. I'm hardly likely
to be hit in the face a third time.

600
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,900
That was the third time, sir.

601
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,368
This isn't a maths class.

602
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:12,618
What are we going to do about
Zaidenweber who, once hired on,

603
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:16,372
is not going to authenticate
our dumb old hay painting?

604
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:21,293
Perhaps, Major, could you not
contrive to neutralise him

605
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:25,172
simply with a...
well, with a gun of some sort?

606
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:29,472
With a silencer screwed onto the tip
of the thing, the barrel there?

607
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:33,594
- Mr Deane.
- Hmm?

608
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:36,429
Too much? No, you're right,
it's too outlandish.

609
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,514
I'll take care of Zaidenweber.

610
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:41,067
More pressing is how do we get
our rogue elephant

611
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:43,858
out of the most expensive hotel
in London?

612
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:49,238
Oh, er, sorry, sir. I haven't quite got
the knack of this.

613
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:53,283
She is a person without vision, Major.

614
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:57,287
She cannot see the plan,
so she will not believe in the plan.

615
00:42:57,366 --> 00:43:00,916
Instant gratification is her
<i>modus vivendi</i>, discipline a dirty word.

616
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,544
There's something
awfully refreshing about her.

617
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:06,968
There's something refreshing
about being plunged into an ice bath

618
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:08,841
and flogged with a birch switch.

619
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,548
Oh, yes, good flogging.

620
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:15,852
Madam Olga, Pennypockets Lane,
third floor to the rear.

621
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:22,650
- Yeah?
<i>- Martin?</i>

622
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:27,071
<i>- Ja,</i> this is Martin Zaidenweber, <i>ja.
- Martin, it's Harry.</i>

623
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:33,078
- Harry Trinkwasser?
- No, Harry Deane, calling from London.

624
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:36,539
- How's Cologne?
- Köln?

625
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:41,377
Oh, <i>ja!</i> Köln is... is good, not so bad.

626
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:44,331
<i>Of course, I'm in Köln.
You catch me at my gym.</i>

627
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:49,010
Practising physical culture. I am gaily
shvitzing away the kilos, you know?

628
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:52,214
We have to fight the heftiness!

629
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,298
Oh, absolutely.

630
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:57,101
Look, I know this will seem
a little out of the blue,

631
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:59,144
and it's sort of embarrassing to say,

632
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:02,186
but I'm calling to ask
if you might have a job on offer soon.

633
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:04,359
- Job?
<i>- I'm going to be free soon.</i>

634
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,310
I'm about to kiss Shabandar off.

635
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:09,864
- You will kiss him off?
<i>- Quitting, yes.</i>

636
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:13,030
<i>Rather embarrassing,
but Shabandar's having problems.</i>

637
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:14,611
<i>Business problems.</i>

638
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:17,664
Rumour has it he's built himself
a bit of a house of cards.

639
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,036
- A card house?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

640
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:24,754
Just last week,
my pay cheque didn't clear.

641
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:32,170
- Good evening.
- Good evening, sir.

642
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:35,424
- What can we do for you?
- Well, I'm checking my friend out.

643
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,600
Lovely room.
She's quite enjoyed her stay.

644
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:40,895
But I can authorise no further payments
against my credit card.

645
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:43,473
So we're going to have to
throw her out on her ear.

646
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:45,650
- Actually...
- Give her the old heave-ho.

647
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:47,443
Bags packed, out on the pavement.

648
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:52,570
Actually, sir, those charges have been
assumed as of 4:17 this afternoon

649
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:54,150
by another party.

650
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:59,239
In fact, I believe she has been
moved up to a senior suite.

651
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:02,082
Senior suite.

652
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:04,536
She's been moved up to...
Who the bloody hell...?

653
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:07,964
Lord Shabandar
called round. You just missed him.

654
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,459
He left with the young lady
in evening wear.

655
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:12,794
Hmm.

656
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:14,720
- Evening wear?
- Yes, sir.

657
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,422
- Quite striking.
- Indeed.

658
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:19,258
A gift from His Lordship.

659
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:22,637
Fine. Excellent. Well, good, then.

660
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,224
But I'd be happy
to close out your account. Let me see.

661
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:29,644
Charges accumulating
prior to this evening...

662
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,195
Yes, here we are.

663
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:37,701
It'll just be two shakes, sir.

664
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:51,006
How is the...
the Major this evening, sir?

665
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:55,132
- Hmm?
- The Major.

666
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:58,506
He's alright, I suppose.

667
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:03,018
- Seems like a busy little fellow.
- Not so little, I would hazard.

668
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:07,522
He's lost a bit of weight recently.

669
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:11,523
- Semi-retired now.
- That is a pity, sir.

670
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:15,448
- At least it's... semi.
- Hmm.

671
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:24,457
Leaving that on the American Express
card, are we, sir?

672
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:26,250
Yes, thank you.

673
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:43,889
Now, the task this evening
is quite straightforward.

674
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:45,891
The Japanese ran the world in the '80s

675
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:48,814
and my little friend Takagawa
screwed me a dozen times.

676
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:51,108
Well, now the boot is on the other foot.

677
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:53,936
So it's kind of like a grudge match.

678
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,944
He's still pissed off
that I beat him to Haystacks, Dawn.

679
00:46:57,023 --> 00:47:00,618
Now, if I can get his lackeys to sell me
their 220 television channels,

680
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:04,789
I become the third largest provider
of premium cable in the whole of Asia

681
00:47:04,864 --> 00:47:09,370
and the Shabandar lion
can finally roar over Japan.

682
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:15,800
Hello. Good day, Mr Shabandar.

683
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:20,051
I am your interpreter
from Konichiwa Media Group.

684
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:23,224
- I am Chuck.
- Delighted to meet you.

685
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:27,854
This is Ms Philomena Puznowski.

686
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:29,271
Hi.

687
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:34,774
Hello. Good day. I am your interpreter
from Konichiwa Media Group.

688
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,820
I am Chuck.

689
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:40,366
This is Mr Katsuhara Cho.

690
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:44,659
Very powerful big man
of Konichiwa Media Group.

691
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:50,494
I present Mr Shabandar
and Ms Puznoskusam.

692
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:51,998
- Marvellous.

693
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:02,138
I think we'll just pick up the names
as we go along, don't you?

694
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:07,014
- It's a pleasure to meet you all.
- And that goes double for me.

695
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:09,937
As I said,
these dinners can be difficult.

696
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:12,481
Don't worry.
These guys seem pretty harmless.

697
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:15,184
They're evil little shits.
Watch me crush them.

698
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:25,077
It occurs to me, I'm afraid
I left my glasses up in the room.

699
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:29,202
Would it... Would the key still work
for me to run up and have a look?

700
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:33,331
- You're wearing them, sir.
- These, to be sure, yes.

701
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:36,915
No, I mean my other glasses,
my distance glasses.

702
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:40,505
Distance.

703
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,554
I'll run you another key, sir.

704
00:49:05,234 --> 00:49:06,486
Huh.

705
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,128
Bloody hell!

706
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:05,090
Hello!

707
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:08,051
Hello!

708
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:21,527
This is Extra Vroom-Vroom channel.

709
00:50:21,644 --> 00:50:24,238
- Aim at people love car.
- Hmm.

710
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:27,283
This is Extra Killer Whale channel

711
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:30,953
for people like watch whale
eat other people.

712
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:34,532
- Very popular after ten o'clock.
- Hmm.

713
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:37,289
This is Let's Young channel.

714
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:41,248
For young teenage wear hair extra crazy,

715
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:45,255
drink sake all night, puke in street.

716
00:50:45,334 --> 00:50:48,383
Combined viewer for Konichiwa TV,

717
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:51,056
42 millions, I think.

718
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:54,177
- Yes.
- Yes, yes, very impressive.

719
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,763
Of course,
I'm familiar with the figures.

720
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:03,937
- However...

721
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:07,740
...my offer for the group was made
in pounds sterling, not yen.

722
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:11,194
But the recent rise of your currency
relative to the pound

723
00:51:11,277 --> 00:51:14,201
would raise my cost fully ten percent,

724
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,124
and that, gentlemen,
is an obligation I never undertook

725
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:20,703
and do not propose to undertake now.

726
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:32,265
There is snow on the mountains
in the winter

727
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:35,434
and the man, in despair,

728
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:38,763
cannot walk to the next valley.

729
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:43,477
But in spring, snow melts

730
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:47,780
and is remembered in tranquillity.

731
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:52,284
Right. Sure, OK, I got you.

732
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:56,114
Yeah, see, what I think the big man here
is trying to tell you is

733
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:59,575
he may have been tough on the price
and a real son of a bitch until now,

734
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:03,834
but if you kind of party down with him
so he don't lose face,

735
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:05,505
maybe things'll go your way.

736
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:09,427
But he ain't about to say it straight
out and look like a wimp, right?

737
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:14,469
If you really wanna
butter these boys up,

738
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:17,392
you ought to invite them all
out to your house.

739
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:20,563
You know, break some bread, mano a mano.

740
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:24,976
Have 'em out for the gala,
why don't you?

741
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:26,732
Maybe you're right.

742
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:29,113
God, what a bore.

743
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,952
Can't be so terribly difficult.

744
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:43,874
Just one foot...

745
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,835
...in front of the other.

746
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:48,962
Let's go dancing!

747
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:35,053
Oh, sod it.

748
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:38,759
You're a bit of a marvel. I hope
you'll stay on, even after the gala.

749
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:41,055
I could use somebody
with your qualities.

750
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:43,645
Well, I guess I got qualities at that.

751
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:47,646
That you do, Ms Puznowski.
That you do.

752
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:51,480
For Pete's sake, this time I think
you really are trying to get me drunk,

753
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:53,155
with all that rice wine an' all.

754
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,699
Well, why not?
No more business this evening.

755
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:58,072
This is a strictly social part
of the day.

756
00:53:58,152 --> 00:54:01,827
Let's get, as you might say, down,
I believe, shall we?

757
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:07,411
- Say that one more time, please.
- Let us get down.

758
00:54:22,885 --> 00:54:24,979
Oh, bugger me.

759
00:54:35,022 --> 00:54:38,526
Well, Lionel,
tonight was real, real fun.

760
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:40,862
That sounds like the past tense.

761
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:44,866
The...

762
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:47,618
Bloody tart!

763
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:56,882
Well, that seems to have had
the desired effect.

764
00:54:58,253 --> 00:54:59,721
My Pants.

765
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:02,265
My bloody trousers!

766
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:08,389
Lionel, you know,
this ain't the place to be...

767
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:09,598
Nonsense.

768
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:13,231
This is precisely what hotels are for.

769
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,312
In the tree!

770
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:17,443
- Taxi!
- My bloody trousers!

771
00:55:19,775 --> 00:55:25,282
Out snogging about when I'm trying
to bloody stay on plan.

772
00:55:30,202 --> 00:55:31,875
This is absurd.

773
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:04,783
Good evening, madam.
I am terribly sorry.

774
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:07,581
Tomorrow evening's Kirov Ballet
is quite sold out

775
00:56:07,656 --> 00:56:09,408
and it's the last performance.

776
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:12,210
- Oh, my!
- Yes.

777
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:15,085
Shall we try <i>The Cherry Orchard</i>
at the Duke of York's?

778
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:17,165
- Yes, let's.
- Lovely.

779
00:56:17,249 --> 00:56:21,880
Lovely. Still just the one...
the one ticket?

780
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:25,136
- Yes, just the one.
- Lovely. As you please.

781
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:29,345
- Have a very nice evening.
- Yes, I shall try.

782
00:56:29,428 --> 00:56:33,149
Straight back into bed. My husband
doesn't arrive until Thursday.

783
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:37,524
Of course, madam.
It must seem like an eternity.

784
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:42,654
There.

785
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:05,589
The vase.

786
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:10,060
Just nipping down the hall for some ice.

787
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:31,623
You can fly private,
but you still have to take the time.

788
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:34,998
That's why you need a place like this
to lay your sleepy head.

789
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,870
Oh, look. Here we are.

790
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:40,504
Here we are. Well, thanks
for escorting me up, Lionel.

791
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:43,836
I'm pretty tuckered out,
so I should probably just...

792
00:57:43,919 --> 00:57:46,923
- Nonsense. Let's have a nightcap.
- What?

793
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:50,350
A nightcap, that's code, really,
for a bit more conversation

794
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:54,020
- and then... who knows?
- Er...

795
00:57:54,096 --> 00:57:57,100
- Well...
- I'm making you uncomfortable.

796
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:59,685
- Perhaps another time.
- Oh, no, that's fine.

797
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:05,067
We should do it tonight, so here we go.
Let's go on in. You first.

798
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:08,322
- What are you doing?
- What?

799
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:11,121
- Evening, Mr Deane.
- Evening.

800
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:14,916
Hey, get your butt in here. Come on.

801
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:20,873
Quite the extensive bar.
What are you having?

802
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:23,584
Let me think about it.
I'll be right there.

803
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:26,591
What are you doing here?
Where are your pants?

804
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:30,049
Hanging on the tree downstairs.
What are you doing with Shabandar?

805
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,720
They're what?

806
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,929
Hanging on the tree downstairs.

807
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:37,106
Good God, I can hardly put it
more plainly!

808
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:39,850
There's Scotch, gin, Jägermeister...

809
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:41,901
Why would you hang your pants
in a tree?

810
00:58:41,977 --> 00:58:44,571
- It ain't Christmas.
- I didn't hang them there.

811
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:46,740
Why did you invite Shabandar
to your room?

812
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:50,069
Do your orgiastic impulses
know no limits? You've been drinking.

813
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:54,073
If I wanna have a nightcap, well,
I am of drinking age and voting age

814
00:58:54,156 --> 00:58:56,204
and the age of consent.

815
00:58:56,283 --> 00:58:58,285
And I can have anyone I want
up to my room,

816
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:01,247
cos you ain't paying for it
no more anyways.

817
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:05,084
- What? Are you jealous?
- Jealous? Don't be absurd.

818
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:06,339
Champagne cooling.

819
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:11,094
Are you coming out or are you slipping
into something more approachable?

820
00:59:11,173 --> 00:59:13,346
Yeah, that's it.

821
00:59:13,425 --> 00:59:15,974
All sense of shame
is well and truly atrophied.

822
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:19,102
Not only do you not seek to disguise
your wanton behaviour...

823
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:21,608
My behaviour? Why don't you go first?

824
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:24,402
Why were you out on that ledge,
what was in that vase

825
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:26,901
and why are your pants
hanging in a tree?

826
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:31,076
You're a very suspicious person, really.
There was nothing in the vase.

827
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:34,701
As for the rest of it, it is involved,
but unlike your shenanigans,

828
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:37,454
there's a sensible plan
governing my behaviour.

829
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:40,911
- Jealous. Good God.
- Ready or not,

830
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:43,209
here I have to come.

831
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:45,461
I need to use the lavatory.

832
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:49,590
But I shall respect your modesty.

833
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:56,426
I don't suppose you could dash down
and get my trousers?

834
00:59:56,510 --> 01:00:00,014
You get out of here, Harry Deane.
You go get your own damn trousers.

835
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:02,145
Well, thanks a lot.

836
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,103
- So you don't have any ice, then?
- What?

837
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:09,531
- What did you say?

838
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:10,983
What did you say?

839
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:15,116
- Do we have any ice?
- No, not with champagne.

840
01:00:15,237 --> 01:00:17,239
Harry. Harry.

841
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:21,327
- Harry.
- It's alright. I've practised.

842
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:24,921
Are you decent?
I'm coming out.

843
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:33,138
I've never told you, have I,
the story of the Shabandar lion?

844
01:00:34,506 --> 01:00:36,759
Oh! Wanker.

845
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:16,215
Stroke of luck, madam. One ticket left
for The Cherry Orchard.

846
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:19,555
- Third row in the stalls, aisle seat.
- Ah, wonderful.

847
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:21,932
Splendid.
Book that for you straightaway.

848
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:25,186
Oh, that's where it is. Excuse me.

849
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:27,814
Housekeeping.

850
01:01:27,893 --> 01:01:29,895
Evening, Mr Deane.

851
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:33,231
Sometimes I wonder if they drink.

852
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:36,944
Right, shan't bother you again

853
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:41,157
and I'll tell switchboard to put
a Do Not Disturb on room 318.

854
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:46,920
318?

855
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:53,756
Good evening.

856
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:56,133
Good evening, sir.
Did you find your glasses?

857
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:58,181
Yes, thank you. Got 'em right here.

858
01:01:58,256 --> 01:02:00,679
Not forgetting anything else,
are we, sir?

859
01:02:00,759 --> 01:02:03,228
No, no, I shouldn't think so.

860
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:09,727
- At least he's wearing a tie.
- Extraordinary fellow.

861
01:02:37,045 --> 01:02:39,264
Good morning.

862
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:47,564
Harry Deane, are you spying on me?

863
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:50,142
No, not at all.
It's just that seducing Shabandar,

864
01:02:50,225 --> 01:02:52,478
last I checked,
was not part of our plan.

865
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,528
Well, like Momma always used to say,

866
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:57,483
scratch it if it itches,
even if it's in your britches.

867
01:02:57,565 --> 01:03:01,115
Miss, I've had sufficient
of your mother's gnomic utterances.

868
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:03,196
Relax, Harry.

869
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:07,205
Face it, our little plan
ain't exactly operational any more.

870
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:08,957
You're wrong.

871
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:10,662
Look...

872
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:19,551
We gotta have a little talk here.
See, there's two kinds of people.

873
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:23,725
There's people like Lionel with big
deals and big cars and manners an' all,

874
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,268
and there's people like us.

875
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:28,267
Look at you, running around
all desperate and cockamamie,

876
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:31,816
pretending like you're gonna
take Lionel for a gazillion dollars.

877
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:34,770
Well, Harry Deane,
it ain't gonna happen.

878
01:03:34,853 --> 01:03:39,074
You're not Lionel,
and why would you wanna be?

879
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:40,867
You got your own thing going on,

880
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:44,287
with all your art
and your beautiful little painting.

881
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:49,118
But you gotta quit
trying to be something you're not.

882
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:53,664
It's OK, you know.
You being you is... is OK.

883
01:03:55,665 --> 01:04:00,262
Look, I understand how certain
unforeseen wrinkles in my plans

884
01:04:00,337 --> 01:04:02,965
have conspired to diminish
your confidence in me.

885
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:06,225
Consider that you might
still have an obligation,

886
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:09,017
having incurred considerable expense,

887
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:11,143
having pledged
a degree of cooperation

888
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:16,103
and having...
having wounded me personally

889
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:19,156
by fraternising with a man
who does not deserve your respect,

890
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:21,824
who's a cynical manipulator
of those less powerful

891
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:24,403
and who's a degenerate nudist at that.

892
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:28,081
Only person I've seen traipsing round
London in their underwear is you.

893
01:04:28,156 --> 01:04:30,158
That is not the point.

894
01:04:32,327 --> 01:04:35,752
You sure do have nice eyes
for a fella who never smiles.

895
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:39,130
Too bad you're all wrapped up
in your crazy scheme.

896
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:43,510
Maybe you could ungrit your teeth
a little bit every once in a while.

897
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:49,478
OK, I get it.

898
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:54,934
I think it's trouble, but...
I'll play along at Lionel's party,

899
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:57,360
if that's what you want.

900
01:04:57,435 --> 01:05:00,564
Yes, yes. Thank you, madam,
that is all I ask.

901
01:05:03,191 --> 01:05:06,741
I'm certain after tonight, you shall
have reason to admire the skills

902
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:11,200
of a reborn, reinvigorated
and surprisingly capable Harry Deane.

903
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:14,869
If you say so.

904
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:40,404
- Very good evening to you.
- You're most welcome.

905
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,277
Thank you.

906
01:05:49,404 --> 01:05:53,250
<i>There are moments in a life
that define a man.</i>

907
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:55,622
<i>This was Mr Deane's.</i>

908
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:57,796
<i>He was sprung for action</i>

909
01:05:57,871 --> 01:06:01,921
<i>and yet perfectly capable
of blowing it completely.</i>

910
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,002
Here we go.

911
01:06:11,342 --> 01:06:12,935
Zowie.

912
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:22,278
- This the painting?
- Painting's in the crate.

913
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:25,072
This is my easel so I can have a look
at the bloody thing.

914
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:28,243
Uncrate the painting in the gallery.
I'll look at it up there.

915
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:33,119
Managed to get hold of the guest list.
No sign of Zaidenweber, thank God.

916
01:06:33,198 --> 01:06:36,327
You should go, Major.
No reason to put yourself at risk.

917
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:38,377
You know where to find me.

918
01:06:38,453 --> 01:06:40,421
Good luck, old thing.

919
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:54,010
- Howdy.
- Good evening.

920
01:06:54,093 --> 01:06:56,391
- Hey, there. Great mask.
- Thank you.

921
01:06:56,471 --> 01:06:58,473
- Hi.
- Good evening.

922
01:07:04,062 --> 01:07:05,609
I'm so glad you could make it

923
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:09,409
and that you've decided
to consummate our little transaction.

924
01:07:09,484 --> 01:07:13,079
Perhaps you might allow me to do
the same with our other little affair.

925
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:15,122
You can try all you want, Shabby.

926
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:17,041
Shabby.

927
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:21,212
- Shabandar-san!
- Oh, Christ.

928
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:23,756
It is I, Chuck.

929
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:27,965
We wish to thank you for extending

930
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:31,048
of your hospitality
of your extra-big house.

931
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:36,682
Oh, yes, quite. Delighted.
I see you managed to find the bar.

932
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:40,356
And if you're hungry,
there's a big old spread over there.

933
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:42,604
Our boy Lionel pulled out all the stops.

934
01:07:42,684 --> 01:07:44,436
Many thanks, Ms Puzkoza.

935
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,999
- Hey, Harry.
- Oh, Deane.

936
01:07:58,074 --> 01:08:01,044
They probably think
you're pretty strange too, Lionel,

937
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:03,918
what with you being a nudist an' all.

938
01:08:03,997 --> 01:08:06,125
What with my being a what?

939
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:08,676
- A nudist.
- Nothing wrong with that, is there?

940
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:11,971
Hell, no. I think
it's real relaxing going naked.

941
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:14,048
What the devil are you talking about?

942
01:08:14,132 --> 01:08:17,887
I understood you to have said once
that you attended the Eden Retreat.

943
01:08:17,969 --> 01:08:21,143
That isn't a nudist gathering.
Somebody's been having you on.

944
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:24,192
It's one of the most formal gatherings
you could imagine.

945
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:27,441
Once again, Deane,
you have things arse backwards.

946
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:30,899
- I understand, sir. I apologise.
- Just forget it.

947
01:08:30,982 --> 01:08:34,828
Deane... we really need
to have a private talk.

948
01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:37,121
There is something
I have to discuss with you.

949
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:38,740
You boys get your bellies full?

950
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:42,327
Blast, here they come again.
I would rather not have to talk to them.

951
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:45,505
- Can't we just do business?
- I can take care of these old boys.

952
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:48,083
And I shall just pop up
and examine the painting.

953
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:51,261
Gentlemen.
Found some nourishment, I see.

954
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:57,722
Have you boys heard of a little thing
called live karaoke?

955
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:35,262
Thank you, gents. That'll do.

956
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:01,368
Hmm.

957
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:05,372
Whoo! Let me tell you
a little bit about Texas.

958
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:31,360
Yippee-ai!

959
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:42,789
That's my boys!
Deep in the heart of Texas!

960
01:10:56,461 --> 01:10:59,715
Assuming I close this deal,
may we conclude yours as well?

961
01:10:59,797 --> 01:11:01,174
The painting arrived, yes?

962
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:03,476
Harry told you
he was going to take a look at it.

963
01:11:03,551 --> 01:11:07,055
No, he couldn't have.
My security's on, you see.

964
01:11:07,138 --> 01:11:08,230
Your security?

965
01:11:08,306 --> 01:11:11,150
It's quite an ingenious system.
I dreamt it up myself.

966
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:13,603
I hope he's not stupid enough
to have gone up there.

967
01:11:13,686 --> 01:11:15,654
Then again,
we are talking about Deane.

968
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:50,223
Oh. Shit.

969
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:54,398
Go away.

970
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:57,905
- No, there's no need for that.

971
01:12:00,066 --> 01:12:01,488
Now, stop it.

972
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:05,079
Stop it. Oh!

973
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:06,656
Harry?

974
01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:10,827
Damn.

975
01:12:12,286 --> 01:12:14,835
OK, Harry,
I'm gonna have to take him down.

976
01:12:15,456 --> 01:12:17,584
Ya! Come on, big boy!

977
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:22,343
Bad lion! Bad lion! Come on!

978
01:12:23,381 --> 01:12:25,554
Heel! Come on!

979
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:34,813
To the deal, then.

980
01:12:36,811 --> 01:12:38,688
Banzai!

981
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:40,773
Oh!

982
01:12:46,904 --> 01:12:49,532
Well, that's that.

983
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:53,294
- Are you sure he's secure?
- That's a double granny.

984
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:54,962
He can't work out of that.

985
01:12:57,123 --> 01:13:00,673
Ms Puznowski,
your timing is impeccable.

986
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:02,594
Thank you.

987
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:05,014
I can handle anything
that's got four legs.

988
01:13:05,089 --> 01:13:06,887
Once you trip 'em up, they're gravy.

989
01:13:06,966 --> 01:13:09,060
- As your momma used to say.

990
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:11,513
I'm going to get somebody
to deal with him.

991
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:20,487
Hey, Shabby.

992
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:22,440
Where on earth have you been?

993
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:23,695
Well...

994
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:30,990
God, Deane,
this is so typical of you.

995
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:34,668
What on earth were you doing larking
about up here creating a nuisance?

996
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:37,748
More than a nuisance,
a bloody dangerous situation.

997
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:40,458
PJ could well have been mauled,
and all to no end.

998
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:44,887
Hardly to no end. It is my job to ensure
the integrity of the collection.

999
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:46,930
Sorry, Deane, it isn't your job.

1000
01:13:47,006 --> 01:13:49,304
Sorry to have to break it to you
like this,

1001
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:51,477
but we're knocking it on the head.

1002
01:13:51,552 --> 01:13:54,431
I've got a new man.
It was a bloody chore hiring him.

1003
01:13:54,513 --> 01:13:56,607
I had to advance him two years' salary.

1004
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:00,895
- Zaidenweber?
- Zaidenweber.

1005
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:16,044
I am pleased to inspect.

1006
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:19,460
- Fine, but I hardly think you're...
- Stand down, Deane.

1007
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:29,473
How does it look, Martin?
What do you say?

1008
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:38,854
Ja. Almost incredible.

1009
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:42,732
Almost incredible.

1010
01:14:44,063 --> 01:14:45,906
But...

1011
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:59,374
Yeah.

1012
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:02,294
The painting is in order.

1013
01:15:02,373 --> 01:15:04,796
- It's beautiful, isn't it?
- Hm-hmm.

1014
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:07,628
The brush strokes. The impasto.

1015
01:15:07,712 --> 01:15:11,342
Everything is just quite the way
it should be.

1016
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:14,303
And there are certain things
that you cannot phoney up.

1017
01:15:14,385 --> 01:15:18,481
Gross depiction, maybe, but
the finer fingerprints of technique, no,

1018
01:15:18,556 --> 01:15:20,479
absolutely not, you cannot, no.

1019
01:15:20,558 --> 01:15:25,064
I mean, this is, I have to say,
really quite bloody marvellous.

1020
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:27,781
This is authentic.

1021
01:15:27,857 --> 01:15:31,737
Now, you can do tests
until your testicles are cerulean blue,

1022
01:15:31,819 --> 01:15:34,948
but there is no doubt in my mind.

1023
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:37,204
- Alright, then.
- Bollocks.

1024
01:15:40,995 --> 01:15:42,838
- I beg your pardon?
- Bollocks.

1025
01:15:42,913 --> 01:15:44,130
Excuse me?

1026
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:52,348
Anyone with an eye can see
that something is amiss here.

1027
01:15:52,423 --> 01:15:54,346
What the devil are you...?

1028
01:15:55,134 --> 01:15:58,104
- Harry!

1029
01:16:00,431 --> 01:16:02,900
Fake.

1030
01:16:02,975 --> 01:16:06,195
The impasto is a caricature
of Monet's actual brush handling,

1031
01:16:06,312 --> 01:16:08,531
which was infinitely more subtle.

1032
01:16:08,606 --> 01:16:11,780
And as far as I'm aware,
Monet never painted over

1033
01:16:11,859 --> 01:16:14,282
a rather hackneyed portrait of...

1034
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:23,954
Martin.

1035
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,502
I'm disappointed.

1036
01:16:37,635 --> 01:16:39,854
Imagine how I feel.

1037
01:16:45,392 --> 01:16:48,316
<i>Auf Wiedersehen, meine Lieblinge.</i>

1038
01:16:54,235 --> 01:16:57,785
And as for you, you're either
rather clever or not clever enough.

1039
01:16:57,863 --> 01:17:01,458
Either way, it's clear
that you're of no further use to me.

1040
01:17:01,534 --> 01:17:03,912
Speaking of clever, what did you expect?

1041
01:17:03,994 --> 01:17:06,292
It was hanging on a wall
in a trailer in Texas.

1042
01:17:06,372 --> 01:17:10,422
And besides,
I was never gonna be any use to you.

1043
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:14,131
Well, no harm done.

1044
01:17:15,798 --> 01:17:19,894
Just a bit of a waste of time,
that's all.

1045
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:23,314
Well, Deane, against expectations,

1046
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:25,767
you seem to know
what you're on about rather.

1047
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:28,319
You will continue in the job.

1048
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:30,988
- Now, if you'll excuse me...
- I think not, sir.

1049
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:35,533
You think not what?

1050
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:38,704
I think not regarding
continuing in the job.

1051
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:41,077
I'm afraid I can no longer
render services

1052
01:17:41,157 --> 01:17:45,333
to a man who'd wilfully insult
the intelligence and moral character

1053
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:48,381
of a woman I have so come
to admire and respect.

1054
01:17:52,793 --> 01:17:54,795
You are a boor, sir.

1055
01:17:55,963 --> 01:17:59,058
And a bully. And I've had enough.

1056
01:17:59,133 --> 01:18:01,727
So I'll just gather my kit...

1057
01:18:04,138 --> 01:18:07,688
...and bid you a semi-fond farewell.

1058
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:10,857
Ms Puznowski, may I see you out?

1059
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:14,690
Yes, you may.

1060
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:16,867
Excuse me.

1061
01:18:20,029 --> 01:18:21,656
You know, Harry Deane,

1062
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:24,868
for an Englishman, you sure do have
some big old cojones.

1063
01:18:36,128 --> 01:18:39,928
<i>They say
you can't put a price on dignity,</i>

1064
01:18:40,007 --> 01:18:43,602
<i>but if you could, in Harry Deane's case,</i>

1065
01:18:43,677 --> 01:18:48,103
<i>it would be approximately £11 million.</i>

1066
01:18:48,182 --> 01:18:50,856
Well, that didn't go
exactly according to plan.

1067
01:18:52,478 --> 01:18:56,608
I know it sounds funny coming from me,
but now I wish you'd let him buy it.

1068
01:18:56,690 --> 01:18:58,863
I just couldn't help myself, you know?

1069
01:18:58,943 --> 01:19:00,695
Hear, hear.

1070
01:19:01,528 --> 01:19:03,371
I'll make it up to you, I promise.

1071
01:19:03,489 --> 01:19:05,867
No, no, you did your bit.
I owe you your wages.

1072
01:19:09,245 --> 01:19:10,497
Here we are.

1073
01:19:12,623 --> 01:19:14,625
Well, here we are.

1074
01:19:35,312 --> 01:19:37,360
Your tickets.

1075
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:40,576
- I regret that it's economy.
- Unrestricted.

1076
01:19:45,322 --> 01:19:49,953
- Well, goodbye, Harry.
- Goodbye.

1077
01:20:00,754 --> 01:20:02,131
Come here.

1078
01:20:06,844 --> 01:20:08,846
- Major.
- Madam.

1079
01:20:23,235 --> 01:20:24,987
Shall we, Major?

1080
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,497
No problems, then, sir?

1081
01:20:31,577 --> 01:20:34,205
Security was a little tougher
than I'd anticipated.

1082
01:20:34,288 --> 01:20:36,791
<i>But you had time
to make the switch?</i>

1083
01:20:36,874 --> 01:20:39,627
<i>Oh, yes.
Shabandar will never suspect.</i>

1084
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:41,087
<i>Beautiful work, Major.</i>

1085
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:43,389
- On which one?
- Both of them.

1086
01:20:43,464 --> 01:20:47,219
Although I'm afraid I had to destroy
your Dusk to prove it was a fake.

1087
01:20:47,301 --> 01:20:50,271
Understood, sir. No hard feelings.

1088
01:20:58,103 --> 01:21:02,950
Thoughtful of this gentleman to make
the trip. Saves us going to Japan.

1089
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,203
Mr Takagawa.

1090
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:08,326
- Hello, Harry.
- Hello, Charlie.

1091
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:10,624
Hello, Major. Everything alright?

1092
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:13,828
- Everything according to plan.
- Right you are, Mr Deane.

1093
01:21:14,995 --> 01:21:16,588
- Very good.

1094
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:25,305
Mr Takagawa wants to thank you.

1095
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:28,885
He says he has been waiting 18 years
for this moment.

1096
01:21:29,009 --> 01:21:31,853
- Not at all. Pleasure to have done it.

1097
01:21:34,348 --> 01:21:35,691
Oh, yes.

1098
01:21:35,766 --> 01:21:38,895
I'm clever. But look.

1099
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:42,398
Monet.

1100
01:21:42,481 --> 01:21:47,078
Inimitable. Though no doubt
your version will satisfy Shabandar.

1101
01:21:51,156 --> 01:21:53,500
He assures me
the transfer has been made.

1102
01:21:53,617 --> 01:21:55,836
The money should now be
in your Swiss account.

1103
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:58,130
- Excellent.
- Hello?

1104
01:21:58,205 --> 01:22:00,207
Major?

1105
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:03,753
It's gone through.

1106
01:22:03,836 --> 01:22:05,930
So much better
than having to count it all.

1107
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:09,759
I'd have got it all bollocksed up
before I got to ten million.

1108
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:12,311
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- Thank you, Harry.

1109
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:16,269
Has anyone given you anything
to take on board our flight?

1110
01:22:16,348 --> 01:22:18,396
- No, ma'am.
- Thank you.

1111
01:22:35,868 --> 01:22:37,870
Oh, Harry Deane.

1112
01:22:39,746 --> 01:22:41,999
You'll see
she gets what we owe her?

1113
01:22:42,082 --> 01:22:45,757
Certainly, sir.
And should we upgrade her ticket?

1114
01:22:45,836 --> 01:22:48,009
Yes, why don't we?

1115
01:22:48,088 --> 01:22:50,841
- Bit of an extravagance.
- Oh, well.

1116
01:22:51,925 --> 01:22:54,428
How will you explain it?

1117
01:22:54,553 --> 01:22:57,022
You know me, Major.
I'll think of something.

1118
01:22:58,599 --> 01:23:00,601
Fancy trying your hand at Picasso?

1119
01:23:00,726 --> 01:23:02,854
Do you think we'd find a use for it?

1120
01:23:02,936 --> 01:23:05,780
Seems Donald Trump
is obsessed with the fellow.

1121
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:08,780
And there's many a billionaire in Texas.

1122
01:23:08,859 --> 01:23:10,111
Mr Deane.

1123
01:23:10,194 --> 01:23:14,415
Oh, yes, Major.
The opportunities are endless.

1123
