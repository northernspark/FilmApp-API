Not just a pocketknife,
Swiss Army knife.

338

a tiny magnifying glass.

339

Fish scaler, a saw, a flamethrower,
chisel, a wire-crimping tool.

340

Did you say flamethrower?

- Yeah.
- Check it.

343

We also added a crossbow
that fires harpoons...

344
00:22:08,651 --> 00:22:12,363
...connected to spider-silk nano-thread.
Has the strength of steel cable.

345

It's a time-consuming,
labor-intensive technology.

346

have to be individually milked.

You and I share a bond, I think.

for me to make this decision.

Okay, 99, you know what?
That is profiling.

necessarily mean that he is a bad guy.

Oh. Um...
That's not really a personal question.

959

Things from my non-work sphere
spilled into my work sphere.

Facts became known, identities were
compromised, and I became a brunette.

Wow. That is a great story...

absolutely nothing about yourself.

I was involved with someone from work.
I lost focus. The mission blew up.

965

I broke it off with that person,
but my identity had already been revealed.

966

So I had two choices.

967
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:25,528
I could either spend the rest of my life
behind a desk...

968

...which would be like
eight hours a day...

against my forehead.

so that's what I did.
