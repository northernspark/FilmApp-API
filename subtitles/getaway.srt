Your wife has been taken.

<i>...but you'll have to overcome your fear
if you want to save her.</i>

00:07:02,574 --> 00:07:05,017
<i>You've done very well so far, Mr. Magna.</i>

32
00:07:05,173 --> 00:07:10,061
<i>During the course of this night,
you will be given several tasks.</i>

33
00:07:10,213 --> 00:07:11,938
<i>If you fail at any...</i>

34
00:07:12,094 --> 00:07:14,461
<i>you will never see your wife again.</i>

35
00:07:14,773 --> 00:07:16,737
<i>How do you like the car?</i>

36
00:07:17,213 --> 00:07:18,740
<i>Do you like it?</i>

37
00:07:18,893 --> 00:07:20,661
<i>It's armored.</i>

38
00:07:20,813 --> 00:07:23,061
<i>It was designed especially for you.</i>

39
00:07:24,973 --> 00:07:26,578
Is she alive?

40
00:07:27,772 --> 00:07:29,497
<i>The police will be looking for you.</i>

41
00:07:29,654 --> 00:07:31,137
<i>If they catch you, ever...</i>

42
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:34,301
<i>...the game's over.
Is that clear?</i>

43
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,061
<i>Brent? Why is this happening?</i>

44
00:07:37,212 --> 00:07:40,062
<i>Please, help me.
I'm so scared.</i>

45
00:07:40,214 --> 00:07:43,301
<i>Where are you taking me?
Where are you taking me? Wait!</i>

46
00:07:44,253 --> 00:07:45,781
<i>She's fine.</i>

47
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:46,893
<i>For now.</i>

48
00:07:47,053 --> 00:07:50,774
<i>She will remain that way
as long as you follow my instructions.</i>

49
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:53,453
<i>I'm watching you, always.</i>

50
00:07:53,853 --> 00:07:55,292
<i>Get rid of your phone.</i>

51
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,653
What do you want?

52
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:44,217
What do you want?

53
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:46,020
Where are we?

54
00:08:55,572 --> 00:08:58,333
No! Please, please, don't leave me here!

55
00:08:58,492 --> 00:08:59,573
No!

56
00:09:34,732 --> 00:09:36,532
<i>- Answer.
- Speed up.</i>

57
00:09:40,332 --> 00:09:41,772
<i>Faster.</i>

58
00:09:43,811 --> 00:09:45,295
<i>Turn left.</i>

59
00:09:49,053 --> 00:09:52,499
<i>Go through the intersection
and turn hard left.</i>

60
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:55,456
No, I can't do that.
I'll dead end into the park.

61
00:09:55,611 --> 00:09:57,291
<i>- Just do it.
- It's Christmas.</i>

62
00:09:57,452 --> 00:10:01,412
<i>- There's gotta be hundreds of people in there.
- I won't ask again.</i>

63
00:10:01,972 --> 00:10:03,053
Shit.

64
00:10:08,172 --> 00:10:09,655
Come on! Get out of my way.

65
00:10:12,852 --> 00:10:14,456
<i>Drive toward the market.</i>

66
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,695
<i>Smash into everything you can.</i>

67
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,460
<i>- I can't do this!
- You have no choice.</i>

68
00:10:27,692 --> 00:10:29,056
Jesus.

69
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:39,976
<i>Excellent.
Now drive onto the skating rink.</i>

70
00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:42,095
<i>- There's too many people!
- Now.</i>

71
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:45,291
Get out of the way!

72
00:10:57,131 --> 00:11:00,655
<i>Go straight to the stage
where the man is speaking. Knock it down.</i>

73
00:11:00,811 --> 00:11:01,936
- I'll kill him.
- Do it.

74
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,011
- Are you crazy?
- Now.

75
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,099
<i>Now go down the stairs.</i>

76
00:11:19,371 --> 00:11:21,138
Ah, shit.

77
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,334
Ah...

78
00:11:31,731 --> 00:11:33,891
<i>Mr. Magma, are you there?</i>

79
00:11:34,571 --> 00:11:36,011
<i>Confirm you're still receiving.</i>

80
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,697
<i>I can hear you.
Where's my wife?</i>

81
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,930
<i>Keep going. Now.</i>

82
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,411
Watch out, watch out!

83

Oh, no, no!

84

Jesus.

85
00:12:08,731 --> 00:12:11,774
Bravo, Mr. Magna.
Your first task is complete.

86
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,338
Am I done?

87
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,497
We're just getting started, my boy.

88
00:12:17,491 --> 00:12:19,050
<i>We're just getting started.</i>

89
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:20,498
<i>Turn right, now.</i>

90
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,379
<i>- The water truck.
- Yeah?</i>

91
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:26,610
<i>Smash into it!</i>

92
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:35,297
<i>Don't stop.</i>

95
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:43,693
<i>Go through it.</i>

96
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,818
Jesus.

97
00:12:57,489 --> 00:12:59,138
<i>Wonderful, Mr. Brent Magna.</i>

98
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,891
<i>Now turn right. Pull into the
underground construction zone.</i>

99
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,297
<i>Relax...</i>

100
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:13,932
<i>...and you will await
further instructions.</i>

101

<i>Do not get out of the car.</i>

Now.

106
00:14:03,728 --> 00:14:06,293
- Look, you got the wrong car. Walk away--

111
00:14:15,528 --> 00:14:17,296

- Drive away now!</i>

112
00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:19,489
- Drive.

113
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:22,093

115
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:25,770
Get off of me, asshole!

116
00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:29,933
Do not ever point a gun at me, you hear me?
Do not ever point a gun at anyone!

117
00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:34,573
Unh! Don't ever touch me like that again.
Do you know what I could have done to you?

118
00:14:34,729 --> 00:14:37,609
- The hell are you doing?
- Strap yourself in.

119
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:39,613
- I'm not doing shit!
- Just put on your seatbelt.

120
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:41,537
- No!

121
00:14:41,689 --> 00:14:44,012

122
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:46,096
<i>Kill her.</i>

123

<i>- Kill her.
- I'm not gonna do it. I can't do that.</i>

125
00:14:55,369 --> 00:14:56,569
<i>You either shoot her...</i>

126
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,698
<i>...or I'm going to shoot your wife.</i>

127
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:02,128
<i>One.</i>

128
00:15:02,608 --> 00:15:04,334
<i>Two.</i>

129
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:06,649
What? What? No.

130
00:15:08,488 --> 00:15:10,332
I can't do that!

131
00:15:10,487 --> 00:15:12,092
I'm not a killer.

132
00:15:12,968 --> 00:15:16,208
<i>It's the right choice.
You'll need her.</i>

133
00:15:16,688 --> 00:15:19,569
You can keep the car.
Can I get out now?

134
00:15:19,728 --> 00:15:23,057
<i>- I'll let you off right up here.
- She is not to be set free.</i>

135
00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:25,936
<i>- I-- Listen.

136
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:28,173
<i>- Understood?
- It's understood.</i>

137
00:15:32,249 --> 00:15:33,612
Oh, great.

138
00:15:34,328 --> 00:15:35,616
Oh, my God.

139
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:37,968
What did you do?

140
00:15:39,368 --> 00:15:40,416
Pull over!

141
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:43,449
Oh! Shit!

142
00:15:46,968 --> 00:15:48,091
Oh, God.

143
00:15:49,129 --> 00:15:52,009
- What the hell are you doing?
- Put on your seatbelt!

144
00:15:54,408 --> 00:15:57,212
Shit. Hey, hey!
Do not touch that gun, all right?

145
00:15:59,288 --> 00:16:02,092
- I need both hands to drive this car!
- Let go of me, asshole! You understand me.

146
00:16:02,247 --> 00:16:04,168
Do not touch that gun!

147
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:07,929
I don't care. I hope we crash.
Help me! This guy's trying to kill me!

148
00:16:08,087 --> 00:16:09,854
- What are you doing?
- Pull us over!

149
00:16:10,007 --> 00:16:12,049
Get in! Get inside the car!

150
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:15,372
- This guy's crazy! Help me!
- Get inside this car, all right?

151
00:16:15,528 --> 00:16:18,092
You understand me? Stay in the car!

152
00:16:30,728 --> 00:16:32,168
Pull over.

153
00:16:32,808 --> 00:16:34,095
Please slow down.

154
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:37,172
- Oh, we're gonna die.
- Shut up.

155
00:16:41,648 --> 00:16:42,892
Oh, my God.

156
00:16:44,367 --> 00:16:45,775
Shit.

157
00:16:46,368 --> 00:16:47,688
No, no, no.

158
00:16:51,688 --> 00:16:53,936
You're the shittiest
driver I've ever seen.

159
00:17:00,007 --> 00:17:02,287
Back off, back off. Jesus!

160
00:17:09,848 --> 00:17:10,895
Oh, shit!

161
00:17:25,688 --> 00:17:26,888
Is he dead?

162
00:17:29,727 --> 00:17:31,047
I hope not.

163
00:17:35,406 --> 00:17:37,175
Listen to me, all right.

164
00:17:37,328 --> 00:17:41,528
I have got to get this car out of the city
right now, or they're gonna murder my wife.

165
00:17:43,087 --> 00:17:44,494
- You understand me?
- Sure.

166
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,568
Let me give you a word to the wise.

167
00:17:46,726 --> 00:17:50,448
Next time you wanna steal a car,
try to make sure that no one is in it.

168
00:17:50,606 --> 00:17:53,934
- It works better.
- I'm not stealing it, you asshole. This is my car.

169
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,371
- What?
- You probably don't understand this...

170
00:17:56,527 --> 00:17:57,814
...because you're a criminal.

171
00:17:57,966 --> 00:18:01,371
Things in this world belong to people
before people like you take them.

172
00:18:01,526 --> 00:18:03,206
This car, which was really great...

173
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:05,932
...till you added all these cameras
and shit in it to drain the battery...

174
00:18:06,087 --> 00:18:08,574
- ...belongs to me.
- How'd you find the car?

175
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:13,655
I got a call from a cop saying that he saw my car
parked in the garage where I found you.

176
00:18:13,807 --> 00:18:15,367
What makes you think it was a cop?

177
00:18:15,526 --> 00:18:17,054
Because he said so, genius.

178
00:18:17,207 --> 00:18:19,607
What kind of cop calls
to tell you he's got your car...

179
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,775
...but he still leaves me inside of it?

180
00:18:21,927 --> 00:18:24,175
- It wasn't the police that called.
- Then who was it?

181
00:18:24,326 --> 00:18:25,494
I don't know.

182
00:18:25,645 --> 00:18:27,686
- When was it stolen?
- Whenever you stole it.

183
00:18:29,766 --> 00:18:32,493
When was the last time you saw it?

184
00:18:32,647 --> 00:18:35,449
2 days ago, I guess.
Look, you're obviously very disturbed.

185
00:18:35,606 --> 00:18:37,527
Whatever trouble you're in,
I'm sure you deserve it.

186
00:18:37,687 --> 00:18:40,414
So I'll cut you a deal.
Pull over, get out and I'll let you walk away.

187
00:18:40,566 --> 00:18:43,207
- Or what, you shoot me?
- Give me back my gun and I will.

188
00:18:43,365 --> 00:18:44,971
What's a kid like you doing with a gun, huh?

189
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,930
So if some dipshit like you steps to me,
I can take care of it.

190
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:50,487
That worked out well for you, didn't it?

191
00:18:51,246 --> 00:18:53,614
Did you recognize the voice,
huh, that voice?

192
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:56,647
- Your friend who wanted you to kill me?
- He's not my friend, okay?

193
00:18:56,806 --> 00:18:59,251
I'm not the kind of person
you wanna be caught kidnapping.

194
00:18:59,406 --> 00:19:01,490
Yeah? You special, is that it?

195
00:19:02,246 --> 00:19:05,455
Just do me one favor, will you?
Shut the hell up.

196
00:19:05,606 --> 00:19:07,286
You shut up!

197
00:19:09,126 --> 00:19:10,566
What are you doing? Hey.

198
00:19:10,727 --> 00:19:12,166
What the hell?

199
00:19:13,766 --> 00:19:18,534
<i>Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way</i>

200
00:19:18,687 --> 00:19:23,247
<i>Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh</i>

201
00:19:23,405 --> 00:19:29,047
<i>Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way</i>

202
00:19:29,206 --> 00:19:34,368
<i>Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh</i>

203
00:19:34,525 --> 00:19:36,414
<i>Dashing through the snow</i>

204
00:19:36,565 --> 00:19:39,730
<i>In a one-horse open sleigh</i>

205
00:19:39,885 --> 00:19:42,046
<i>O'er the hills we go</i>

206
00:19:42,206 --> 00:19:44,573
<i>Laughing all the way</i>

207
00:19:46,565 --> 00:19:49,129
I can't believe
you threw my phone out the window.

208
00:19:53,724 --> 00:19:57,327
- I have a lot of money, you know.
- Good for you.

209
00:19:57,965 --> 00:20:00,410
As in, if you let me go,
I can give you a lot of money.

210
00:20:00,565 --> 00:20:03,685
- I don't want your money.
- What do you want?

211
00:20:03,845 --> 00:20:05,765
I want you to stop talking.

212
00:20:07,325 --> 00:20:08,646
And I want my wife back.

213
00:20:09,445 --> 00:20:12,053
- And he took her?
- He did.

214
00:20:12,965 --> 00:20:16,730
Whatever you owe him, I can get however
much it is to pay him off, no problem.

215
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:18,413
We'll take care of it right now.

216
00:20:18,565 --> 00:20:20,649
You have to let me go
and stop almost killing us.

217
00:20:20,806 --> 00:20:25,127
I would love to let you out of this car alright.
Unfortunately, I can't do that.

218
00:20:25,285 --> 00:20:26,529
Why the hell not?

219
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:30,329
Because he asked me not to
and I am doing whatever he asks.

220
00:20:31,365 --> 00:20:33,526
So, what? What are you supposed to do?

221
00:20:35,605 --> 00:20:37,929
- I don't know.
- Well, who is he?

222
00:20:40,685 --> 00:20:43,130
- I don't know.
- What do you know?

223
00:20:43,645 --> 00:20:45,205
Not much.

224
00:20:55,685 --> 00:20:57,168
No, no, no!

225
00:20:58,645 --> 00:20:59,692
Get up!

226
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:03,369
- Shut up.
- Ow! Aah!

227
00:21:03,565 --> 00:21:07,209
Please. Please. Please, don't shoot me.
Please, don't shoot me.

228
00:21:07,364 --> 00:21:08,565
Quiet.

229
00:21:13,766 --> 00:21:17,006
<i>- Answer.
- It's time for your next task.</i>

230
00:21:17,165 --> 00:21:20,013
<i>- What is it?
- More police are coming.</i>

231
00:21:20,165 --> 00:21:22,488
<i>You'll have 4 minutes to get away.</i>

232
00:21:22,645 --> 00:21:24,806
<i>You'll follow my instructions exactly.</i>

233
00:21:25,164 --> 00:21:28,013
<i>- Someone wants to say hello.
- Please, please.</i>

234
00:21:28,165 --> 00:21:29,770
<i>- Leanne?
- Please. Help.</i>

235
00:21:29,925 --> 00:21:32,174
<i>The clock starts now.</i>

236
00:21:35,364 --> 00:21:36,892
Damn it!

237
00:21:37,044 --> 00:21:38,334
I'm totally screwed.

238
00:21:41,684 --> 00:21:43,213
Oh!

239
00:21:49,844 --> 00:21:52,005
- Ram him.
- What are you doing?

240
00:21:57,444 --> 00:21:59,407
<i>- Oh, my God.
- Keep going.</i>

241
00:22:00,004 --> 00:22:02,765
You're an idiot.
That's assault with a deadly weapon.

242
00:22:02,924 --> 00:22:04,692
They could shoot at us now.

243
00:22:06,605 --> 00:22:09,004
<i>- Speed up.
- Shit.</i>

244
00:22:10,404 --> 00:22:11,844
<i>Turn right now.</i>

245
00:22:16,805 --> 00:22:19,204
<i>Remember, if they catch you...</i>

246
00:22:20,164 --> 00:22:21,484
<i>you'll be a widower.</i>

247
00:22:26,884 --> 00:22:28,564
<i>- Turn left.
- Oh, shit.</i>

248
00:22:32,564 --> 00:22:34,648
<i>- Force him off the road.
- Look out!</i>

249
00:22:36,403 --> 00:22:38,892
- This is not very subtle you know!
- What are you talking about?

250
00:22:39,045 --> 00:22:41,292
You're not making yourself
very hard to find.

251
00:22:47,524 --> 00:22:50,447
God, I promise I'll be good from now on.
Please let me live.

252
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:52,807
<i>- You're really not helping, okay?
- Turn right.</i>

253
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:02,492
Great.

254
00:23:12,723 --> 00:23:14,252
<i>Turn right down the alley.</i>

255
00:23:16,164 --> 00:23:17,243
Stop!

256
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:22,250
Holy shit.

257
00:23:26,403 --> 00:23:28,411
- 2 minutes.
- We're gonna die, please stop!

258
00:23:38,725 --> 00:23:40,643
<i>I don't think you'll make it.</i>

259
00:23:44,963 --> 00:23:48,248
- What are you doing?
- Take a deep breath, okay? And calm down.

260
00:23:53,644 --> 00:23:55,051
Shit.

261
00:23:58,763 --> 00:24:00,323
<i>I wouldn't relax just yet.</i>

262
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:05,971
- Shit.
- Not again.

263
00:24:06,123 --> 00:24:08,251
<i>- Did you think we were done?
- No, don't!</i>

264
00:24:09,603 --> 00:24:10,682
God!

265
00:24:17,763 --> 00:24:19,204
<i>You're running out of time.</i>

266
00:24:21,122 --> 00:24:22,966
Oh! Oh!

267
00:24:23,243 --> 00:24:24,410
<i>Tick tock, tick tock.</i>

268
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:33,130
<i>You have less than a minute.</i>

269
00:24:33,283 --> 00:24:35,530
<i>- Turn into the park.
- No, not the park!</i>

270
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:37,330
Here we go.

271
00:24:40,322 --> 00:24:42,406
<i>Your wife's time is running out.</i>

272
00:24:43,963 --> 00:24:45,850
- Watch out!
- Unh!

273
00:24:46,002 --> 00:24:48,523
<i>- Go through the intersection.
- All right, hold on!</i>

274
00:24:57,523 --> 00:24:59,563
<i>Not much time, Mr. Magna.</i>

275
00:25:00,202 --> 00:25:01,522
Oh, no!

276
00:25:04,321 --> 00:25:07,083
- No, please don't! Don't!
- Yep, yep, yep, hold on!

277
00:25:07,243 --> 00:25:08,650
<i>5...</i>

278

00:25:10,762 --> 00:25:12,170

00:25:15,602 --> 00:25:19,050
...zero. Bravo, Mr. Magna.
Well done.

283
00:25:20,001 --> 00:25:22,250
Bravo. Your wife lives...

284
00:25:23,241 --> 00:25:24,409
<i>...for now.</i>

285
00:25:28,642 --> 00:25:30,247
Well done.

286
00:25:47,042 --> 00:25:48,089
Answer.

287
00:25:48,241 --> 00:25:52,082
Brent Magna is
both reckless and fearful.

288
00:25:52,242 --> 00:25:53,726
He is, in short...

289
00:25:53,882 --> 00:25:58,083
...a dangerous driver
and should pursue another profession.

290
00:25:58,242 --> 00:26:01,449
Remember that review?
It wasn't very flattering.

291
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:03,926
<i>They're blind to your real talents...</i>

292
00:26:04,082 --> 00:26:06,930
<i>...which are perfectly
suited to my needs.</i>

293
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:08,249
Do I know you?

294
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:10,290
<i>I know you, Mr. Magna...</i>

295
00:26:10,442 --> 00:26:12,166
<i>- ...and I believe in you.
- Listen.</i>

296
00:26:12,322 --> 00:26:15,323
I need to know when this is all
gonna be over, all right? I need--

297
00:26:17,522 --> 00:26:18,766
What are you doing?

298
00:26:18,921 --> 00:26:21,202
Hey, what are you doing?

299
00:26:23,121 --> 00:26:25,446
- I hate you.
- Yeah, I love you.

300
00:26:25,603 --> 00:26:29,170
You realize I'll just have to buy another
limited edition Shelby Super Snake...

301
00:26:29,322 --> 00:26:33,643
...take another 6 months to re-time the cams,
open up the intake and customize it.

302
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:36,082
And then I'm gonna drive
it over your face.

303
00:26:36,242 --> 00:26:39,689
- You sure know a lot about cars for--
- A girl?

304
00:26:39,842 --> 00:26:41,205
Yeah.

305
00:26:41,761 --> 00:26:43,082
Wow.

306
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:47,690
<i>I like fast cars and computers
and boy things, how butch.</i>

307
00:26:47,842 --> 00:26:49,687
It's the 21st century,
you should join it.

308
00:26:53,281 --> 00:26:55,529
- What are you doing?
- I'm documenting this shit.

309
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,842
I'm not going to jail
after we get arrested.

310
00:26:58,001 --> 00:27:00,969
- Well, nobody's gonna get caught, okay?
- That's right, I forgot.

311
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:05,169
We're just gonna die because you're a dumb-ass
who attacks the police with a damn car.

312
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,088
Now every cop in this entire country...

313
00:27:07,242 --> 00:27:10,089
...is hoping to run to us, to put a couple bullets
in our heads. That's a good plan.

314
00:27:10,241 --> 00:27:12,565
- We are alive.
- Barely.

315
00:27:12,802 --> 00:27:14,330
Not much of a thinker are you?

316
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,928
Well you know, I didn't actually graduate
from charm school like you so maybe...

317
00:27:18,081 --> 00:27:21,290
...you know someday you can give me
some tutoring or something.

318
00:27:22,521 --> 00:27:25,370
This is what he did
to my beautiful, beautiful paint job.

319
00:27:25,521 --> 00:27:26,809
Just get in the car.

320
00:27:26,961 --> 00:27:31,206
This is all the crap that he drilled
into my carbon fiber interior.

321
00:27:31,361 --> 00:27:33,204
And this is the dumb-ass
who got me into this mess.

322
00:27:33,362 --> 00:27:35,849
- Stop filming me, all right?
- Wave hi to the judge.

323
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,921
- Say hi to all your new friends in jail.
- Hey! Put that thing away! I'm trying-- Just stop it.

324
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,289
What is--? You're like ADD or something.
What are you fiddling with now?

325
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,089
- Stop doing that.
- Why?

326
00:27:48,241 --> 00:27:50,881
Because this guy is watching us, okay?

327
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:53,441
- And I need you to stop--
- I know what I'm doing.

328
00:27:53,601 --> 00:27:56,961
- Just sit still and listen to me for 2 seconds.
- I know what I'm doing.

329
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,129
See, I went to school
and I know things...

330
00:27:59,281 --> 00:28:02,446
...which is why I don't have to
steal stuff, like some people.

331
00:28:03,922 --> 00:28:07,446
If you're so smart, you tell me what's
going on with all these cameras, huh?

332
00:28:15,201 --> 00:28:16,969
They're all linked to a single feed.

333
00:28:17,121 --> 00:28:21,443
It's not only encrypted, but it's
piggybacking on a public server.

334
00:28:21,601 --> 00:28:22,680
Huh?

335
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,729
It means that they're hosting
this live feed from these cameras...

336
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,641
...on a government server
without them knowing about it.

337
00:28:30,401 --> 00:28:33,162
So anybody can watch it, even us.

338
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,848
- Wait a second.
- What?

339
00:28:41,001 --> 00:28:44,043
- These aren't coming from the same place.
- Where are they coming from?

340
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,164
Looks like a parking garage.

341
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,961
- Can you tell where it is?
- I don't know. Could be anywhere.

342
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,721
- Do you think it's where he might be?
- Doubt it. But he can see it.

343
00:28:52,881 --> 00:28:54,442
I don't like the fact that he's watching us.

344
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,640
Do you think you can track him
with that thing?

345
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:59,768
No, and if anyone did,
he would just dump the IP address.

346
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,488
As long as his feed is hosted remotely,
there's no way to find it.

347
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,843
- And that thing isn't really well-hidden.
- What?

348
00:29:05,999 --> 00:29:07,288
Microphone.

349
00:29:07,441 --> 00:29:09,764
- Oh, so he's listening to us too?
- Probably.

350
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,720
Well, I'll give you this,
you are bright.

351
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,404
It's called being educated.

352
00:29:18,561 --> 00:29:21,200
You should look into it
when you're not committing crimes.

353
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,999
Scratch that, you'll be in jail.

354
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,641
All right, answer.

355
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,048
Pull up power plant on the GPS.

356
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,927
We're kind of busy right now.

357
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:45,520
Learn to multitask.

358
00:29:47,761 --> 00:29:50,565
Or let your new little friend help you.
Look under the visor.

359
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:53,440
<i>Won't you do that?</i>

360
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,963
<i>I'm uploading a new set of directions.</i>

361
00:29:58,479 --> 00:30:00,084
That's the city power plant.

362
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,764
At exactly 11:30...

363
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:04,240
...you will be there.

364
00:30:07,399 --> 00:30:09,047
Why are we going to the power plant?

365
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,599
Always so inquisitive.

366
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,363
I like it.

367
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,844
Now listen carefully,
you're to break into the control room.

368
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,288
Access the remote system...

369
00:30:31,439 --> 00:30:33,447
- ...and insert that drive.
- What will that do?

370
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:36,283
You're a clever girl.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

371
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,159
He wants to cut the power off.
Why do you want to cut the power?

372
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:44,686
You have some time until 11:30.

373
00:30:45,439 --> 00:30:48,047
I wouldn't spend it
trying to figure out my motives.

374
00:30:51,838 --> 00:30:53,202
He's a real asshole.

375
00:31:27,758 --> 00:31:29,121
So you don't know who that is?

376
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:32,799
No.

377
00:31:33,718 --> 00:31:35,683
- No idea?
- I got ideas.

378
00:31:36,719 --> 00:31:39,043
People I used to work with...

379
00:31:39,198 --> 00:31:41,599
...but nobody I know could set up
something like this.

380
00:31:42,998 --> 00:31:45,606
- So why you?
- Because I can drive.

381
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,280
- That's debatable.
- No, I mean, I used to race.

382
00:31:49,878 --> 00:31:53,086
- Really?
- Really.

383
00:31:53,238 --> 00:31:55,846
Professionally, like, real racing.

384
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:58,083
Don't think I ever saw you on TV.

385
00:31:58,238 --> 00:32:00,638
There was a couple weeks
there where you might have.

386
00:32:01,158 --> 00:32:02,643
And?

387
00:32:04,158 --> 00:32:05,926
And what?

388
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:11,078
I washed out.

389
00:32:14,837 --> 00:32:16,201
How come?

390
00:32:16,918 --> 00:32:19,558
I don't know, I just did.
Doesn't matter now.

391
00:32:20,477 --> 00:32:22,399
That's a pretty shitty answer.

392
00:32:28,158 --> 00:32:31,922
I washed out because I believed
everybody who told me how great I was.

393
00:32:32,077 --> 00:32:36,157
Turns out the only thing I was great at
was wrecking expensive cars.

394
00:32:36,959 --> 00:32:39,239
So I fell off the pro circuit
and I owed a bunch of money.

395
00:32:39,397 --> 00:32:41,918
This is the only thing
I was ever any good at...

396
00:32:42,118 --> 00:32:45,118
...so I took whatever job
paid the most.

397
00:32:47,078 --> 00:32:49,642
I did some things I'm not proud of.

398
00:32:52,477 --> 00:32:55,839
But then I got out of it. And this...

399
00:32:56,917 --> 00:32:58,565
...is why.

400
00:33:04,717 --> 00:33:06,517
She's beautiful.

401
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:11,441
- Is she from here?
- Yeah.

402
00:33:12,438 --> 00:33:15,525
She always wanted to come back,
so we thought...

403
00:33:15,678 --> 00:33:19,442
...it'd be a good place
to lay low and start over.

404
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:22,325
Then I come home from work today,
the door is busted open...

405
00:33:22,477 --> 00:33:25,686
...the place is a wreck,
there's blood on the floor.

406
00:33:26,078 --> 00:33:31,282
My cell phone rings and this voice tells me
if I ever wanna s--

407
00:33:33,276 --> 00:33:35,242
If I ever wanna see her again...

408
00:33:35,997 --> 00:33:38,158
...I gotta do this job.

409
00:33:41,078 --> 00:33:43,477
And if I tell anyone, she'll be dead.

410
00:33:46,837 --> 00:33:50,121
Next thing you know,
I'm driving around in your car.

411
00:33:54,998 --> 00:33:56,797
You souped this thing up yourself?

412
00:33:58,037 --> 00:34:00,045
Yeah, it was a graduation present.

413
00:34:00,477 --> 00:34:03,445
Nice. Something tells me
your dad's not a mechanic.

414
00:34:06,716 --> 00:34:08,965
He's the CEO
of one of the largest banks in town.

415
00:34:09,118 --> 00:34:13,001
We moved here about 2 years ago
for him to take it over.

416
00:34:15,037 --> 00:34:18,966
I barely see him, but this car
is the nicest gift he ever gave me.

417
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:23,197
Well, I'm sorry about all the damage.

418
00:34:26,076 --> 00:34:29,165
You know, you could also apologize
for taking me hostage.

419
00:34:29,756 --> 00:34:31,885
And you could apologize
for putting a gun in my face.

420
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:33,520
I will if you let me out.

421
00:34:33,917 --> 00:34:36,961
There's only one thing
I'm concerned about right now...

422
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:39,998
...and I'm gonna do whatever I have to
to get her back.

423
00:34:40,157 --> 00:34:43,517
So if he says you gotta stay in the car,
you gotta stay in the car.

424
00:34:43,676 --> 00:34:45,281
And where does that get you?

425
00:34:46,238 --> 00:34:48,244
Why is this happening?
What is he after?

426
00:34:49,836 --> 00:34:52,160
You clearly haven't
thought this through.

427
00:34:52,956 --> 00:34:56,840
What happens when this is done
and he gets what he wants?

428
00:34:56,996 --> 00:34:59,604
Why would he even give her back to you?

429
00:35:00,476 --> 00:35:03,924
If I were him, I'd kill her
and I'd probably kill you.

430
00:35:04,076 --> 00:35:06,957
- Shit.
- What?

431
00:35:07,116 --> 00:35:09,365
I'd probably kill me too.

432
00:35:34,516 --> 00:35:36,480
Looks like they've already been here.

433
00:35:37,796 --> 00:35:41,243
If he was already here, why didn't
he just take out the power himself?

434
00:35:41,677 --> 00:35:43,236
I don't know.

435
00:35:45,275 --> 00:35:46,565
Stop here.

436
00:35:48,836 --> 00:35:50,440
Why?

437
00:35:50,596 --> 00:35:52,483
Ever see what happens to a metal car...

438
00:35:52,635 --> 00:35:55,517
...when it touches a transformer
that powers the whole city?

439
00:35:55,996 --> 00:35:59,041
- Just wait here, I'll handle it.
- What, alone?

440
00:35:59,196 --> 00:36:00,636
Yeah, just be ready to go.

441
00:36:00,996 --> 00:36:02,316
You sure?

442
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:03,515
Turn the car around,
that's what I should do.

443
00:37:03,675 --> 00:37:05,280
No, I should go in after her.

444
00:37:05,635 --> 00:37:08,003
No, she's fine.
She knows what she's doing.

445
00:37:15,676 --> 00:37:17,804
Hello? I don't have much time.

446
00:37:17,955 --> 00:37:20,475
I'm in this car with this man
and his wife was kidnapped.

447
00:37:20,635 --> 00:37:22,282
<i>I speak English. Calm yourself.</i>

448
00:37:22,436 --> 00:37:24,476
Could you just send someone, please?

449
00:37:24,635 --> 00:37:26,644
<i>- What is your, uh, emergency?
- I don't know.</i>

450
00:37:26,795 --> 00:37:29,599
It's this voice telling us what to do.
You have to help us.

451
00:37:29,756 --> 00:37:32,636
<i>- Exactly what is your location?
- I'm at the power plant.</i>

452
00:37:35,194 --> 00:37:37,082
- You make it so much fun.
- Shit.

453
00:37:37,234 --> 00:37:40,519
Wherever that clever mind takes you,
remember, I've already been there.

454
00:37:40,674 --> 00:37:42,715
<i>Look around.</i>

455
00:37:43,075 --> 00:37:44,558
<i>You see? That's right.</i>

456
00:37:46,475 --> 00:37:49,159
The police will think
you blew up the power station.

457
00:37:52,955 --> 00:37:55,279
Can I give you some advice? Run.

458
00:37:56,795 --> 00:37:58,202
Come on, come on.

459
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:05,119
- Go, go, go!
- What, what, what?

460
00:38:05,275 --> 00:38:06,879
- Drive, drive! Go!
- What happened?

461
00:38:23,194 --> 00:38:24,559
- Hold on.
- Shit.

462
00:38:33,714 --> 00:38:34,718
Aah!

463
00:38:52,075 --> 00:38:53,199
Faster!

464
00:38:54,554 --> 00:38:56,038
Go faster!

465
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:08,721
Oh!

466
00:39:47,355 --> 00:39:49,842
What are you doing? What are you doing?

467
00:39:51,034 --> 00:39:52,998
I'm not dying for you.

468
00:39:54,232 --> 00:39:56,678
- What happened?
- This is a part of his plan.

469
00:39:56,834 --> 00:39:59,037
I was on camera that whole time.

470
00:39:59,193 --> 00:40:02,597
He could have easily taken out the power
himself, but he lured us in there because...

471
00:40:02,753 --> 00:40:05,480
...he wanted me
to get caught on camera doing it.

472
00:40:05,633 --> 00:40:08,033
You think the cops
would ever believe me now?

473
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:12,041
Before, it was just you...

474
00:40:12,192 --> 00:40:13,841
...this car.

475
00:40:14,394 --> 00:40:16,357
But now I'm screwed too.

476
00:40:17,634 --> 00:40:19,280
I'm sorry.

477
00:40:23,753 --> 00:40:25,914
I gotta take care of myself.

478
00:40:39,233 --> 00:40:41,436
<i>- Answer.
- Stop her from leaving.</i>

479
00:40:41,794 --> 00:40:43,518
Go to hell.

480
00:40:44,553 --> 00:40:47,357
<i>Where are you taking me?
Where are you taking me? Wait. Wait.</i>

481
00:40:47,514 --> 00:40:49,477
Leanne? Leanne, can you hear me?

482
00:40:49,633 --> 00:40:51,356
Can you--? Please.

483
00:40:51,513 --> 00:40:53,358
Leanne, can you hear me?

484
00:40:53,513 --> 00:40:55,117
<i>Brent. Brent, what's going on?</i>

485
00:40:55,273 --> 00:40:56,833
Are you okay? Have they hurt you?

486
00:40:56,994 --> 00:40:58,640
<i>- Why is this happening?
- Leanne.</i>

487
00:40:58,793 --> 00:41:01,882
<i>- Please help me! Brent?
- Leanne, are you all right, baby?</i>

488
00:41:02,033 --> 00:41:03,679
<i>Please help me!
I'm so scared.</i>

489
00:41:03,832 --> 00:41:05,512
I'm coming after you.
I'm gonna make all this better.

490
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:07,320
- I'm gonna get--
- Aah!

491
00:41:08,792 --> 00:41:10,276
What--?

492
00:41:12,312 --> 00:41:15,357
Put my wife back on! Put her back on!

493
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:17,160
Is my wife all right?

494
00:41:18,913 --> 00:41:21,881
<i>I told you not
to let her out of the car.</i>

495
00:41:22,032 --> 00:41:24,116
<i>- I just need to see if she's--
- I warned you.</i>

496
00:41:43,032 --> 00:41:44,321
I'm sorry.

497
00:41:44,992 --> 00:41:46,957
It's not your fault.

498
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:53,272
I know what it's like to disappoint everyone,
but I never thought that I'd let her down.

499
00:41:54,792 --> 00:41:56,035
She's still alive.

500
00:42:07,672 --> 00:42:08,992
You don't have to do this.

501
00:42:09,632 --> 00:42:11,117
I want to.

502
00:42:27,512 --> 00:42:29,912
Where are you? Where are you?

503
00:42:47,272 --> 00:42:48,439
What are you doing?

504
00:42:48,592 --> 00:42:50,119
We gotta figure out his plan.

505
00:42:51,513 --> 00:42:52,953
Oh, shit.

506
00:43:15,751 --> 00:43:17,519
Get down, get down. Come on.

507
00:43:49,272 --> 00:43:50,711
Okay, okay.

508
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:56,316
He was having you make this.

509
00:43:57,110 --> 00:44:00,831
You're blocking off a path.
Half of these are one-way streets.

510
00:44:00,991 --> 00:44:04,831
With these intersections blocked off,
no one will be able to get through here.

511
00:44:05,751 --> 00:44:09,035
Until they clean this mess up, there'll
only be one way out of the city.

512
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:11,471
The rest will be a total shit show.

513
00:44:12,431 --> 00:44:14,395
It's an escape route.

514
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:20,154
I just wish I knew what he was after.

515
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:22,997
You and me both.

516
00:44:38,151 --> 00:44:41,118
<i>- Answer.
- I have good news for you.</i>

517
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:42,831
<i>This is your last assignment.</i>

518
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:46,155
<i>Look up number 5 in the GPS.</i>

519
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:49,476
<i>Follow the directions precisely.
You have 10 minutes.</i>

520
00:44:49,631 --> 00:44:52,958
- It's the bank.
- What bank?

521
00:44:53,109 --> 00:44:55,913
- He wants us to rob my dad's bank.
- Oh, shit.

522
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:57,514
We can't do that.

523
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:59,439
<i>Do as instructed. The clock is ticking.</i>

524
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:02,635
You can't. There's no way we could do that.
The security's way too tight.

525
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:05,190
<i>Don't concern yourself with security.</i>

526
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:08,798
<i>- He wants us to get caught.
- Follow the GPS. Turn around.</i>

527
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:11,231
This is a suicide mission.
You had to listen to me, we can't do this.

528
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:13,278
<i>Ignore her.
Listen to me. Turn around now.</i>

529
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:16,191
<i>- Am I gonna see my wife again?
- Turn around.</i>

530
00:45:16,351 --> 00:45:18,554
<i>- I'm losing my patience with you.
- Listen to me alright.</i>

531
00:45:18,709 --> 00:45:22,071
- No.
- I need to know when I'm going to see my wife.

532
00:45:22,231 --> 00:45:24,554
<i>No, you listen to me, and turn the car around.
This is your last warning.</i>

533
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:29,152
I need to be told that she is all right
and when this shit is gonna be over!

534
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:32,638
<i>Do you want to see her again?</i>

535
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:38,351
<i>Get control of yourself
and turn the car around.</i>

536
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:45,430
You can't do this.

537
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:50,393
- Listen to me, this is a setup.
- He will kill her.

538
00:45:50,549 --> 00:45:53,595
That's why they used my car.
it had to be me. Think about it.

539
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,030
My dad, he cut off all of my funds.

540
00:45:56,189 --> 00:45:58,591
Now my car is causing havoc
all over the city...

541
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:00,233
...and I'm seen robbing his bank?

542
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:02,590
He wants us to get caught.

543
00:46:14,749 --> 00:46:16,791
- What does he wanna steal?
- Money.

544
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,353
But that's just it,
it's not that kind of bank.

545
00:46:19,509 --> 00:46:21,594
- What do you mean?
- My dad runs an investment bank.

546
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:23,669
- There's no cash.
- Oh, shit!

547
00:46:32,469 --> 00:46:34,750
- God.
- So, what are you talking about, like safety deposit boxes?

548
00:46:34,909 --> 00:46:38,238
No, there's nothing like that in there,
just computers.

549
00:46:39,509 --> 00:46:42,236
- Bonds. Bearer bonds.
- Bearer bonds? How old are you?

550
00:46:44,869 --> 00:46:47,750
What is he after, then?
What's he trying to steal?

551
00:46:48,109 --> 00:46:49,156
Unless...

552
00:46:50,949 --> 00:46:52,390
Hold on!

553
00:46:56,309 --> 00:46:59,518
- Unless what?
- Unless you don't want to do a record of your money.

554
00:46:59,669 --> 00:47:01,917
- Right, right, like it's dirty money.
- Exactly.

555
00:47:04,549 --> 00:47:06,918
- So how do you move dirty money?
- Look out, look out!

556
00:47:09,668 --> 00:47:12,353
- Come on, help me.
- They could encrypt the information...

557
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:15,597
...on a numeric transfer key.
A flash drive with account numbers.

558
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:18,237
If you stole one of these
little transfer keys, right...?

559
00:47:18,389 --> 00:47:20,233
- You could drain the accounts.
- Right.

560
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:24,192
No one would report that money stolen,
because it's not supposed to exist.

561
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,873
- How much are we talking about?
- It could be billions.

562
00:47:27,669 --> 00:47:29,273
I should have been a banker.

563
00:47:31,189 --> 00:47:32,988
Tell me that you're not serious.

564
00:47:33,629 --> 00:47:34,872
Shit!

565
00:47:41,748 --> 00:47:43,832
- I'm gonna go for it.
- No, don't go for it!

566
00:47:43,989 --> 00:47:45,278
Here we go!

567
00:47:50,549 --> 00:47:51,552
That was awesome.

568
00:47:52,229 --> 00:47:53,395
Aah!

569
00:48:00,868 --> 00:48:02,997
Aah! Get us out of here!

570
00:48:11,228 --> 00:48:12,472
Watch out.

571
00:48:22,869 --> 00:48:25,270
I really, really hate you.

572
00:48:25,428 --> 00:48:26,596
I can understand that.

573
00:48:54,428 --> 00:48:55,911
- What are you doing?
- Just wait.

574
00:48:58,108 --> 00:49:00,389
Okay, just sit still and
be quiet for a minute.

575
00:49:11,988 --> 00:49:15,348
- Okay, it's done. I bought us some time.
- What?

576
00:49:15,507 --> 00:49:19,033
I hacked into the server connected to these
cameras, put on a loop of us driving.

577
00:49:19,188 --> 00:49:21,511
- That's what he can see right now.
- Why?

578
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:23,032
So that you'll listen to me.

579
00:49:23,189 --> 00:49:26,156
When we get there, we're gonna get
caught and your wife will die.

580
00:49:26,307 --> 00:49:27,595
We're his decoys.

581
00:49:29,427 --> 00:49:30,868
- Great.
- The power's out...

582
00:49:31,028 --> 00:49:33,548
...which means the security
infrastructure has been compromised.

583
00:49:33,707 --> 00:49:36,315
And when that happens,
there's a procedure. Oh, shit.

584
00:49:36,468 --> 00:49:39,152
My dad said something about this.

585
00:49:41,628 --> 00:49:44,551
They're being moved.
They're moving them right now.

586
00:49:44,907 --> 00:49:48,476
They move anything that sensitive to a secure
location until the system is back up...

587
00:49:48,627 --> 00:49:51,595
- ...and then they run like a million tests.
- By the time we get there--

588
00:49:51,747 --> 00:49:53,514
We'll be robbing an empty bank.

589
00:49:53,667 --> 00:49:56,035
Please, let's just find a place
to look at it first.

590
00:49:56,187 --> 00:49:58,707
I guarantee you it's swarming with cops.

591
00:49:59,947 --> 00:50:01,268
How long do we have?

592
00:50:01,427 --> 00:50:03,828
I don't know, 5,
maybe 10 minutes at the most.

593
00:50:07,228 --> 00:50:09,311
Watch where you're going, asshole!

594
00:50:13,068 --> 00:50:17,388
<i>It's the most wonderful time of the year</i>

595
00:50:19,147 --> 00:50:20,795
<i>With the kids jingle-belling</i>

596
00:50:20,948 --> 00:50:25,596
<i>And everyone telling you
"Be of good cheer"</i>

597
00:50:25,748 --> 00:50:30,592
<i>It's the most wonderful time of the year</i>

598
00:50:37,707 --> 00:50:39,146
I'll go check it.

599
00:50:55,348 --> 00:50:56,787
So you were right?

600
00:50:58,108 --> 00:50:59,273
I wish I wasn't.

601
00:51:00,947 --> 00:51:02,234
So, what do we do now?

602
00:51:02,587 --> 00:51:03,874
I'm thinking.

603
00:51:04,627 --> 00:51:08,228
You said there was a procedure.
if the power goes out, they'll move the drives?

604
00:51:08,387 --> 00:51:09,991
- Yeah.
- Where do they move them?

605
00:51:10,147 --> 00:51:12,951
I don't know, it's classified
information for the bank.

606
00:51:13,106 --> 00:51:14,711
Right. Shit.

607
00:51:14,866 --> 00:51:17,955
But they gotta get picked up right.
They have to be picked up from here.

608
00:51:18,948 --> 00:51:21,031
I mean they've got all these cops here
waiting for us.

609
00:51:21,187 --> 00:51:24,110
I mean, what, is there a back door?
ls there another entrance?

610
00:51:31,747 --> 00:51:33,306
Remember that parking spot that we saw?

611
00:51:33,826 --> 00:51:35,671
You asked if I thought
that's where he was?

612
00:51:35,827 --> 00:51:38,870
- Yeah.
- Well, I bet he's there now.

613
00:51:44,386 --> 00:51:45,630
I told you you were bright.

614
00:51:46,307 --> 00:51:48,073
Let's go.

615
00:53:01,905 --> 00:53:03,106
Yeah.

616
00:53:04,506 --> 00:53:08,827
3, 1, 9, 7, 2,
1, 3, 4, 2, 6.

617
00:53:21,427 --> 00:53:22,746
What?

618
00:53:24,305 --> 00:53:25,429
Go, go, go!

619
00:53:26,906 --> 00:53:29,273
- You got it?
- Yeah, go!

620
00:53:32,466 --> 00:53:33,905
Get them!

621
00:53:45,905 --> 00:53:47,072
Answer me.

622
00:53:48,463 --> 00:53:49,632
Answer me, answer me.

623
00:53:50,545 --> 00:53:51,833
Answer!

624
00:53:52,624 --> 00:53:53,672
Answer.

625
00:53:54,705 --> 00:53:58,874
You're dead. Your wife is dead.
It's over! Don't play with me!

626
00:53:59,025 --> 00:54:00,792
We hold the cards now, asshole!

627
00:54:33,266 --> 00:54:35,545
Could you be a little bit more careful?

628
00:54:37,266 --> 00:54:39,064
How do I get this drive out?

629
00:54:40,824 --> 00:54:41,905
Got it!

630
00:54:46,706 --> 00:54:47,871
Knock him! Hit him!

631
00:54:56,224 --> 00:54:57,664
Holy shit!

632
00:55:05,185 --> 00:55:06,712
Oh, my God, go!

633
00:55:16,624 --> 00:55:18,873
- Get down, get down, get down!
- Do something!

634
00:55:20,264 --> 00:55:22,305
Please, get us out of here!

635
00:55:28,023 --> 00:55:29,148
Oh!

636
00:55:33,744 --> 00:55:35,511
- Look out!
- Hold on!

637
00:56:08,184 --> 00:56:10,432
This is Sofia Police Department.

638
00:56:10,585 --> 00:56:12,711
- Shit.
- Pull over the car now!

639
00:56:12,862 --> 00:56:14,063
Lose them.

640
00:56:15,343 --> 00:56:18,387
Driver, pull over car now!

641
00:56:18,543 --> 00:56:20,463
We're trapped.
Sit back. Hold on. You ready?

642
00:56:22,264 --> 00:56:24,828
All right.
Where's the gun? Where's the gun?

643
00:56:26,063 --> 00:56:28,988
- Give me the gun!
- Keep your hands where we can see them.

644
00:56:29,144 --> 00:56:31,828
Now, just go with me on this,
all right? Just go with me.

645
00:56:31,983 --> 00:56:35,552
Back off! Or I will shoot her head!
I will blow her brains out!

646
00:56:35,703 --> 00:56:38,312
Back off! Hey! Hey! See this?

647
00:56:38,464 --> 00:56:40,788
Back off, or I'm killing this girl,
you hear me?

648
00:56:40,943 --> 00:56:44,184
- I will kill this girl right now!
- What the hell are you doing?

649
00:56:44,343 --> 00:56:47,509
I am going to blow her head off!
Now, you. You. Yeah, you!

650
00:56:47,664 --> 00:56:49,267
You okay? Hey!

651
00:56:49,423 --> 00:56:52,467
Back, back, back!
Or I'm killing this girl, you hear me?

652
00:56:52,624 --> 00:56:55,144
Back off! Back off!

653
00:56:56,465 --> 00:56:58,547
That's it, you're doing great.

654
00:57:04,303 --> 00:57:05,744
Get out of my way, copper.

655
00:57:11,982 --> 00:57:13,903
I can't believe that worked.

656
00:57:27,263 --> 00:57:30,427
They're clear.
I've sent you their location.

657
00:57:30,583 --> 00:57:32,427
Intercept them.

658
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:46,064
What are you doing?

659
00:57:46,942 --> 00:57:49,190
- I'm gonna let you out.
- What?

660
00:57:49,343 --> 00:57:51,351
Come on. You're not a suspect anymore.

661
00:57:51,502 --> 00:57:54,066
They think I kidnapped you.
Just tell them you were a hostage.

662
00:57:54,222 --> 00:57:56,022
- No, I'm--
- I'm serious. I'm serious.

663
00:57:56,183 --> 00:57:59,182
You've done more than enough for me.
Alright I can't risk your life anymore.

664
00:57:59,342 --> 00:58:02,462
- I really can't. You gotta get out, okay?
- No.

665
00:58:02,622 --> 00:58:05,471
- Get out of the car.
- No.

666
00:58:05,622 --> 00:58:09,747
- Come on, get out of the car, will you?
- I'm coming with you.

667
00:58:09,902 --> 00:58:12,663
You're an extremely stubborn person,
all right, you know that?

668
00:58:14,542 --> 00:58:15,982
I know.

669
00:58:16,542 --> 00:58:18,911
But I'm still not getting
out of this car.

670
00:58:20,823 --> 00:58:25,110
Besides, without me, you'd probably do
something stupid, like get your face shot off.

671
00:58:31,462 --> 00:58:32,663
All right.

672
00:58:36,062 --> 00:58:37,666
You don't even know my name, do you?

673
00:58:40,382 --> 00:58:41,942
No.

674
00:58:44,982 --> 00:58:47,263
Aah! Go!

675
00:58:56,983 --> 00:58:58,061
Damn it!

676
00:59:07,822 --> 00:59:10,070
- Ow!
- Are you all right?

677
00:59:12,661 --> 00:59:13,982
Hit him!

678
00:59:35,901 --> 00:59:37,265
Damn it!

679
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:56,302
Get down, get down!

680
00:59:57,021 --> 00:59:58,069
Down!

681
01:00:04,621 --> 01:00:06,149
Look out!

682
01:00:07,821 --> 01:00:09,469
Oh, God.

683
01:00:20,782 --> 01:00:22,222
Get us off the train!

684
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:24,301
- Where's the gun? Find the gun!
- I don't know!

685
01:00:24,461 --> 01:00:26,381
- Find the gun!
- I'm looking!

686
01:00:26,541 --> 01:00:27,862
Find it!

687
01:00:32,461 --> 01:00:34,622
- You got it? Give it to me!
- I found it! Here!

688
01:00:38,781 --> 01:00:40,385
Just hold the wheel for a second!

689
01:00:41,101 --> 01:00:42,945
I need you to downshift! You ready?

690
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:46,224
Now!

691
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:33,100
I have an idea.

692
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:35,065
Get out.

693
01:01:48,701 --> 01:01:50,381
So we meet up with him.

694
01:01:50,539 --> 01:01:52,787
We do an exchange.
The drive for your wife.

695
01:01:52,941 --> 01:01:54,468
It'll never work. He'll kill us.

696
01:01:54,619 --> 01:01:55,908
I have a way around it.

697
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:01,909
We use his camera to feed the video
to the cops. They'll see everything.

698
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:44,220
Answer the phone.

699
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:49,307
<i>- Answer.
- You think you are so smart?</i>

700
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:51,828
<i>- I wouldn't be so--
- No, shut up and listen.</i>

701
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:53,825
We have what you want,
let's make a trade.

702
01:02:53,979 --> 01:02:56,500
- Where?
- You know where I work?

703
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:58,220
I'll see you there in 2 hours.

704
01:02:58,579 --> 01:03:00,019
Goodnight, asshole.

705
01:04:27,099 --> 01:04:28,582
Where's my wife?

706
01:04:28,738 --> 01:04:30,627
Where's my drive?

707
01:04:46,378 --> 01:04:47,742
Where's my wife?

708
01:04:59,739 --> 01:05:01,823
- No. No! No!
- Leanne!

709
01:05:01,978 --> 01:05:03,025
Brent?

710
01:05:04,778 --> 01:05:06,098
I need to know they're real.

711
01:05:10,618 --> 01:05:12,702
You. Follow him.

712
01:05:19,536 --> 01:05:20,705
Let her go first.

713
01:05:42,258 --> 01:05:44,058
Oh, thank God you're here.

714
01:05:44,217 --> 01:05:45,745
I love you.

715
01:06:05,577 --> 01:06:07,182
I'm waiting.

716
01:06:07,337 --> 01:06:08,626
Waiting.

717
01:06:21,898 --> 01:06:23,021
Let's go.

718
01:06:30,057 --> 01:06:32,142
- Shoot them.
- Brent, look out!

719
01:06:32,657 --> 01:06:33,780
No! No!

720
01:06:41,617 --> 01:06:43,505
- Throw her in!
- No! Aah!

721
01:06:43,658 --> 01:06:44,946
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

722
01:06:48,697 --> 01:06:49,941
Shit, they got the kid.

723
01:06:51,097 --> 01:06:52,701
- I gotta go after her.
- Go get her.

724
01:06:53,818 --> 01:06:55,585
- You stay with the police.
- Be careful.

725
01:06:55,737 --> 01:06:57,144
Damn it!

726
01:07:13,497 --> 01:07:15,383
Are you hurt, ma'am?

727
01:07:27,177 --> 01:07:28,541
Shit.

728
01:07:36,656 --> 01:07:38,096
He has a gun on me.

729
01:07:39,975 --> 01:07:41,776
Brent, he has a gun.

730
01:07:43,176 --> 01:07:44,257
Please hear me.

731
01:07:46,856 --> 01:07:48,537
<i>I hope you can see this.</i>

732
01:07:48,936 --> 01:07:50,781
Quiet! Don't talk.

733
01:07:56,777 --> 01:07:59,266
<i>Brent, I'm trying
to show you where we are.</i>

734
01:08:07,177 --> 01:08:08,617
Move out of my way!

735
01:08:15,375 --> 01:08:16,785
Brent, yes!

736
01:08:19,335 --> 01:08:20,864
- You're screwed, asshole!
- Shut up!

737
01:08:23,816 --> 01:08:25,824
Come on, come on.

738
01:08:46,137 --> 01:08:47,664
Oh!

739
01:08:57,936 --> 01:08:59,420
Damn it!

740
01:09:06,215 --> 01:09:07,982
What are you doing? Is that a camera?

741
01:09:11,496 --> 01:09:13,897
- Give it to me, give it to me!
- No, give it back!

742
01:10:03,814 --> 01:10:05,582
Ah, shit! Bastard.

743
01:10:25,095 --> 01:10:26,100
Damn it!

744
01:11:29,574 --> 01:11:30,578
Oh, shit.

745
01:12:07,653 --> 01:12:08,974
Shit.

746
01:12:37,254 --> 01:12:39,502
The only way out of the city.

747
01:12:40,374 --> 01:12:41,738
I know where she is.

748
01:13:15,493 --> 01:13:18,701
- Pull over! Give me the gun!
- What are you doing? Stop it!

749
01:13:19,333 --> 01:13:20,381
You want us to die?

750
01:13:42,972 --> 01:13:44,936
Come on, come on!

751
01:15:11,652 --> 01:15:13,256
- Get out!
- What?

752
01:15:13,812 --> 01:15:15,176
Now!

753
01:15:39,971 --> 01:15:42,099
- Are you okay? Are you okay?
- Yeah.

754
01:15:49,732 --> 01:15:52,056
Stay there.
You're under arrest.

755
01:16:06,412 --> 01:16:07,612
Thanks.

756
01:16:07,771 --> 01:16:10,215
Everybody back!

757
01:16:19,051 --> 01:16:20,132
Ugh!

758
01:16:22,531 --> 01:16:25,096
- I guess I owe you one, huh?
- And you owe me a new car.

759
01:16:25,251 --> 01:16:29,256
Don't worry about the car. It just needs
a new paint job and she'll be fine.

760
01:16:43,972 --> 01:16:46,176
- What's that?
- I don't know.

761
01:16:48,451 --> 01:16:50,011
It's not mine.

762
01:16:53,091 --> 01:16:55,655
<i>- Hello?
- Aren't you going to thank me?</i>

763
01:16:55,811 --> 01:16:58,418
<i>I did for you
what you could never do for yourself.</i>

764
01:16:58,570 --> 01:17:00,851
<i>I showed you what you are made of.</i>

765
01:17:01,492 --> 01:17:06,020
<i>Please excuse me
if I wasn't able to be there in person.</i>

766
01:17:06,851 --> 01:17:09,099
<i>I'm sure you understand,
under the circumstances...</i>

767
01:17:09,251 --> 01:17:11,575
<i>...it would have been
most inconvenient for me.</i>

768
01:17:12,450 --> 01:17:15,496
<i>If you're asking yourself
who I am to you...</i>

769
01:17:15,891 --> 01:17:20,376
<i>...I will answer very simply:
I am your greatest fan.</i>

770
01:17:21,211 --> 01:17:24,134
<i>I always thought you could have been
at the very top of your profession...</i>

771
01:17:24,291 --> 01:17:26,691
<i>...if only you believed you could.</i>

772
01:17:26,930 --> 01:17:29,331
<i>So that's it, you see.</i>

773
01:17:30,691 --> 01:17:34,979
<i>Please send your lovely wife my
best wishes for a happy Christmas.</i>

774
01:17:35,130 --> 01:17:39,331
<i>I'm sincerely glad you worked things out
to be with her for the holidays.</i>

775
01:17:41,571 --> 01:17:45,815
<i>It's the season to be together
with loved ones, so I'm told.</i>

776
01:17:46,331 --> 01:17:48,534
