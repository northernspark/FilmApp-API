1
00:00:08,424 --> 00:00:10,257
I can't see a thing in here.

2
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:12,126
Ow. Will you cut it out?

3
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,534
- Big shock.
- BOY

4
00:00:20,536 --> 00:00:22,637
I don't hear anything.

5
00:00:26,792 --> 00:00:28,425
Wait.

6
00:00:28,427 --> 00:00:30,311
There it is again.

7
00:00:30,313 --> 00:00:32,763
You must have dog ears,
'cause the only thing I hear

8
00:00:32,765 --> 00:00:34,282
is Charlie breathing.

9
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:37,185
Let's just get out of here.
This is really stupid.

10
00:00:37,187 --> 00:00:40,120
Yeah. Next time you hear that there's
some kind of hideous, deformed creature

11
00:00:40,122 --> 00:00:41,822
living in some
old abandoned building,

12
00:00:41,824 --> 00:00:44,158
do us a favor
and leave us out of it.

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,893
Hey, I had a solid lead.

14
00:00:45,895 --> 00:00:48,179
Jeanie Taylor
told Martie Nixon.

15
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:51,498
And I heard her telling Ethan
Reynolds about it in Phys Ed.

16
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,703
Besides, I didn't know we were going
to end up trapped in a broom closet.

17
00:00:55,705 --> 00:00:57,538
That's a solid lead?

18
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,375
Nice going, goggles.
You are so not cut out for this.

19
00:01:01,377 --> 00:01:03,895
Hey, don't call me that.

20
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,830
Would you two knock it off
already?

21
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:08,232
Trust me, whatever it is
you thought you heard,

22
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:11,519
it's gone.
Let's just go home.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,074
Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

24
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,817
See? I told you
there's nothing out here.

25
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:32,823
You were saying?

26
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,295
That's got to be the wind
or something.

27
00:01:39,565 --> 00:01:42,566
I'm leaning more
towards "something."

28
00:01:42,568 --> 00:01:45,403
Come on, let's check it out.

29
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:48,222
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

30
00:01:48,224 --> 00:01:50,391
Fine, stay here then.

31
00:01:50,393 --> 00:01:52,593
Yeah, stay here.

32
00:01:52,595 --> 00:01:55,296
Uh, an even worse idea.

33
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,535
What's that?

34
00:02:01,537 --> 00:02:04,205
Thermal camera.

35
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,240
Monster tracker.

36
00:02:06,242 --> 00:02:07,958
Shh.

37
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,093
I think I heard something.

38
00:02:10,095 --> 00:02:12,463
What is it?

39
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,798
Something's over there.

40
00:02:21,825 --> 00:02:24,574
- I don't see anything.
- Guys?

41
00:02:24,576 --> 00:02:28,796
I think we might want
to find another way out here.

42
00:02:42,545 --> 00:02:45,462
Well, well,
look what we got here.

43
00:02:45,464 --> 00:02:47,765
Out favorite
middle-school wimps.

44
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,118
The monster geek squad!

45
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,321
Actually, it's "Elite Monster-Hunting
Unit," you Neanderthal.

46
00:02:54,323 --> 00:02:55,556
Oh, get up.

47
00:02:58,277 --> 00:03:01,479
"Neanderthal"?
That sounds bad.

48
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:04,482
It has a bunch of those,
uh, whatchamacallums?

49
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:06,500
Syllables, moron.

50
00:03:06,502 --> 00:03:09,136
Oh yeah? How about a
bruise for every syllable?

51
00:03:09,138 --> 00:03:10,404
Ne-an-der-thal!

52
00:03:10,406 --> 00:03:11,756
Ah!

53
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,141
What's wrong, dorks?

54
00:03:13,143 --> 00:03:15,193
No science club today,
so you thought you'd try

55
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,146
the life of crime, huh?
A little breaking and entering?

56
00:03:18,148 --> 00:03:20,047
Truth be told,

57
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:22,884
we were chasing down an
unidentified beast-like creature

58
00:03:22,886 --> 00:03:24,584
right inside that old building.

59
00:03:24,586 --> 00:03:26,570
We have it trapped in there.

60
00:03:26,572 --> 00:03:27,971
Cork it, geek boy!

61
00:03:27,973 --> 00:03:29,873
Nobody's talking to you.

62
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:32,276
What gives, Charlie? What
are you and the dork patrol

63
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:33,694
doing mess around
the old bank?

64
00:03:33,696 --> 00:03:35,096
None of your business.

65
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:37,281
Whoa! Take it down a notch,
brainiac,

66
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:39,149
or you'll be chewing
on a knuckle sandwich.

67
00:03:39,151 --> 00:03:40,851
A triple decker!

68
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:42,652
Hey, yeah, what's with
this jacket anyway?

69
00:03:42,654 --> 00:03:44,221
You wear this stupid thing
every day.

70
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:46,290
He's thinks he's going
to Hartford someday!

71
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,524
Uh, doubt it!

72
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,578
It's "Harvard," you meathead.

73
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,464
You know, you might have thought
high school would have made you

74
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,515
a little bit smarter.

75
00:03:54,517 --> 00:03:56,884
And that jacket
belonged to his brother,

76
00:03:56,886 --> 00:03:58,119
the Marine.

77
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:05,209
Where are the Marines
when we need them?!

78
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:06,944
A beast-like creature?

79
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:09,129
Could you be bigger wimps?

80
00:04:09,131 --> 00:04:12,216
Figures dorks like you would be
afraid of a little kitty cat.

81
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,786
Wait till all the other losers
at their school hear about this!

82
00:04:17,473 --> 00:04:21,491
You're dead meat, Hamilton!

83
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:43,050
Nice costume, dork.

84
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:47,821
Told you-hardly anyone else
is wearing a costume.

85
00:06:47,823 --> 00:06:49,490
I feel like a total idiot.

86
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,792
Dude, it's Halloween.
We always wear costumes.

87
00:06:51,794 --> 00:06:54,828
But don't you think we might be getting a
little bit old for this kind of stuff?

88
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,313
No.

89
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:57,381
Guys!

90
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:58,715
It finally came!

91
00:06:58,717 --> 00:07:00,684
"Swamp Monsters" 217!

92
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:04,871
The one where the swamp alien has to
battle the zombie slime creatures.

93
00:07:04,873 --> 00:07:06,907
He ends up having to eat
his own head.

94
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:09,326
- Hey, Charlie!
- Oh! Brandy, hey.

95
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:11,478
How's it going?

96
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,431
Did you finish your chapter for
the Chem Lab notes last night?

97
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:17,168
Oh, yeah, Chem Lab!
Absolutely!

98
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,102
I, uh, got 'em right here.

99
00:07:28,497 --> 00:07:30,181
Oh yeah.

100
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:33,883
Nice costume. You supposed
to be a dog or something?

101
00:07:33,885 --> 00:07:36,736
Oh, no, werewolf actually.

102
00:07:36,738 --> 00:07:39,022
It's cute.

103
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:42,309
Yeah, we were actually just
making fun of all the losers

104
00:07:42,311 --> 00:07:46,330
that actually wear costumes. Yeah,
usually we're way more mature-

105
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:47,531
I can see that.

106
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:11,155
Oh, great.

107
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:15,709
We could run. I hear Mexico
is lovely this time of year.

108
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:27,404
What's this? "A guide to
demons, monsters and aliens"?

109
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:29,373
Ooh, which chapter
are you in?

110
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,491
This is so lame, jake.
Just leave them alone.

111
00:08:31,493 --> 00:08:34,678
Oh, hey look,
it's the geek patrol.

112
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,248
Not so bad when you're not armed
with a milkshake, are you?

113
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,266
Serious, Jake!
I'm gonna tell ma.

114
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,268
Hey, why don't you guys
knock it off?

115
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,754
What's the matter? Run out of
kids to bully at your own school?

116
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,973
- You had to come back here?
- Jake!

117
00:08:45,975 --> 00:08:48,626
How much grass do you think
Charlie here could eat

118
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,960
before he chucks it all up,
huh?

119
00:08:50,962 --> 00:08:53,580
- Maybe we should find out.
- Get off of him!

120
00:08:53,582 --> 00:08:56,483
- How about a game, twerps?
- Ah!

121
00:08:56,485 --> 00:08:59,236
Oh, get real! These losers
couldn't play football

122
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:02,089
against my grandma's
knitting club.

123
00:09:02,091 --> 00:09:04,175
And those old bags
can't even walk.

124
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:09,263
Yeah, we were thinking
about taking the day off

125
00:09:09,265 --> 00:09:11,014
from anything that requires
the human brain.

126
00:09:11,016 --> 00:09:13,783
So yeah, maybe football
might just do the trick.

127
00:09:13,785 --> 00:09:15,819
What did you say, geek boy?

128
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:19,023
It sounded like an insult,

129
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:22,259
but, no, that can't be right.
That would require guts,

130
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:25,312
which you and the wimp brigade
don't have.

131
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:28,948
Charlie! You're not
exactly helping here.

132
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,469
Any rock-for-brains
can throw a football.

133
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,438
Well, apparently not anyone,
since you and your team

134
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,024
have lost almost
every game this year,

135
00:09:37,026 --> 00:09:39,643
and set the record for most
interceptions in a season.

136
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:41,812
Oh really?

137
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,914
Let's see you do this,
Einstein.

138
00:09:51,106 --> 00:09:52,689
Uh, you were saying?

139
00:09:52,691 --> 00:09:55,559
I was saying
that it doesn't take much

140
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,728
for a bunch of morons
to go out on the court

141
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,296
and bash each other's
brains in.

142
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,648
It's a field, professor,
not a court.

143
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,500
No, all right.

144
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:05,502
All right, Charlie,
I got something for you,

145
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:08,122
now that you're
Mr. Big and Bold.

146
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,176
Let's hear it.

147
00:10:13,178 --> 00:10:14,911
Name your challenge.

148
00:10:14,913 --> 00:10:17,347
Uh, all right.

149
00:10:17,349 --> 00:10:20,201
Uh...

150
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:23,103
the old Sullivan place-
one night.

151
00:10:23,105 --> 00:10:25,772
- Ooh!
- You and the geek squad

152
00:10:25,774 --> 00:10:28,525
spend an entire night up there.

153
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:31,128
- Excuse me?
- Oh, you heard me.

154
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,298
The Sullivan house,
one night.

155
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,600
Isn't that place
supposed to be haunted?

156
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:37,835
Oh, is it?

157
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,703
Yeah, that's the point,
loser.

158
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:42,523
You guys think you're some kind
of monster experts?

159
00:10:42,525 --> 00:10:44,041
Prove it.

160
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:50,046
That's what I thought.

161
00:10:50,048 --> 00:10:51,765
Name the time and place.

162
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:53,300
We'll be there.

163
00:10:53,302 --> 00:10:55,902
Tomorrow-Halloween.

164
00:10:55,904 --> 00:10:57,621
Done.

165
00:10:59,475 --> 00:11:01,841
Okay, Charlie,
it's your funeral.

166
00:11:01,843 --> 00:11:05,445
Behind the school,
bike path, tomorrow,

167
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:07,314
6:00. Be there.

168
00:11:23,232 --> 00:11:25,482
What did you
just get us into?

169
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:28,051
Please tell me
this is a dream.

170
00:11:28,053 --> 00:11:30,654
- I think the word is "nightmare."
- Come on, guys!

171
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:34,024
Are we going to let them show us
up for the rest of our lives?

172
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:38,112
How many more swirlies and wedgies and wet
willies are we going to have to take?

173
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,764
I don't know, Charlie, but I'd rather
take more of what they're dishing out

174
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:43,283
than go near
that Sullivan house.

175
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:44,735
Yeah, Charlie,
the house is haunted.

176
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,720
Not sure what's confusing
about that.

177
00:11:46,722 --> 00:11:48,905
And you guys
actually believe that?

178
00:11:48,907 --> 00:11:50,890
Yeah, why wouldn't we?

179
00:11:50,892 --> 00:11:52,792
You just want us
to come with you.

180
00:11:52,794 --> 00:11:56,129
Guys, we're going to be in the
same school as them next year.

181
00:11:56,131 --> 00:11:59,483
Do you really want to be a punching
bag for those jerks 'til we graduate?

182
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,302
Fine, I'm done.

183
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:08,425
So what do you have in mind?

184
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:12,012
Yeah, what's the plan?

185
00:12:12,014 --> 00:12:15,248
Meet me at my house at 6:00.
I'll lay it out for you guys.

186
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,685
- So you mean you'll make it up as you go?
- Exactly.

187
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:34,467
Charlie, I wish
you'd drink more milk.

188
00:12:34,469 --> 00:12:36,052
Stop with all that soda.

189
00:12:36,054 --> 00:12:38,405
I'm allergic to milk, mom.
Remember?

190
00:12:38,407 --> 00:12:42,058
And I haven't had a soda
in, like, forever.

191
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,676
Yeah, he's allergic
to everything,

192
00:12:43,678 --> 00:12:46,713
- especially girls.
- Zip it, runt.

193
00:12:46,715 --> 00:12:48,515
Oh no, you don't
still have the hots

194
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,850
for the girl
in your Chemistry Lab, do you?

195
00:12:50,852 --> 00:12:52,986
I'm serious, Todd.

196
00:12:52,988 --> 00:12:54,537
I've got a better idea.

197
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:57,341
Why don't you come over here
and make me zip it?

198
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,459
Hey!

199
00:12:59,461 --> 00:13:02,762
He threw his peas at me!

200
00:13:02,764 --> 00:13:04,531
And they say you can't
train a baby.

201
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,251
Charlie, Todd, stop it.
Just eat.

202
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:10,970
I got you some almond milk. They say
it's better for your digestive tract.

203
00:13:10,972 --> 00:13:14,274
Yeah, Charles, or how about
some of Noah's baby formula?

204
00:13:14,276 --> 00:13:16,326
I'm warning you, Todd.

205
00:13:23,685 --> 00:13:26,703
Warning me how?

206
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:28,822
Sit down and be quiet, Todd,

207
00:13:28,824 --> 00:13:31,925
or I'm going to let Charlie have five
minutes alone with you off the leash.

208
00:13:31,927 --> 00:13:35,712
Not cool, Russ!

209
00:13:46,308 --> 00:13:49,059
Hey, guys?

210
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:52,029
You might want to come over here
and read this.

211
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,785
"During the 1950s,

212
00:13:58,787 --> 00:14:00,987
"the Sullivan Gang was rumored
to be responsible

213
00:14:00,989 --> 00:14:03,923
"for over 30 bank robberies
in California alone.

214
00:14:03,925 --> 00:14:06,426
"They were finally killed
in a shootout

215
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:08,412
"right here in Elk Falls
at their hide-out,

216
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,447
"the old Sullivan place.

217
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:14,084
Cops said it was
a total bloodbath."

218
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:16,419
Like, body parts everywhere!

219
00:14:16,421 --> 00:14:20,173
It also says the place is supposed
to be haunted by the gang

220
00:14:20,175 --> 00:14:22,342
and their vicious old dog
Salty.

221
00:14:22,344 --> 00:14:25,645
Haunted by a dog?
Let me see that.

222
00:14:25,647 --> 00:14:28,882
"Over the years,
many citizens of Elk Falls

223
00:14:28,884 --> 00:14:31,518
"have reported hearing
strange noises

224
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,186
"coming from the house,

225
00:14:33,188 --> 00:14:35,622
"which to this day
remains abandoned

226
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:38,791
"due to an ongoing dispute
over ownership

227
00:14:38,793 --> 00:14:40,778
"and the city's inability
to find a buyer

228
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:45,148
willing to take on
the troubled property."

229
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,951
Dude! Look at these guys!

230
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:50,620
They look like total psychos!

231
00:14:50,622 --> 00:14:54,874
Hey, this one looks
just like you, goggles.

232
00:14:54,876 --> 00:14:56,876
Haunted by a dog?

233
00:14:56,878 --> 00:14:59,996
What a bunch of baloney!
The place is just old.

234
00:14:59,998 --> 00:15:01,497
We're doing this.
End of story.

235
00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:04,417
Yeah, we kind of have to.
We chicken out now,

236
00:15:04,419 --> 00:15:07,087
our lives at Joe Dante
middle school are gonna suck.

237
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:10,807
- Probably high school too.
- It already sucks.

238
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:14,611
Yeah, but we're talking about it
going to an entirely new level.

239
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,229
How are we going
to get our parents

240
00:15:16,231 --> 00:15:18,148
to let us stay the night
in that old house?

241
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,266
It's simple.
We tell our parents

242
00:15:20,268 --> 00:15:21,868
that we're staying over
at each other's houses,

243
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,603
and by morning,
we're heroes.

244
00:15:23,605 --> 00:15:25,889
Jake and those other lug nuts
won't be able

245
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:28,575
- to push us around anymore.
- I gotta go home.

246
00:15:28,577 --> 00:15:32,012
My mom's making something
that vaguely resembles meatloaf.

247
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:35,932
If I don't get there soon, my sister
will gives hers to the dog before I can.

248
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:39,152
Remember, we meet behind the
school tomorrow at 6:00.

249
00:15:39,154 --> 00:15:41,838
Does this mean
no trick-or-treating?

250
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,207
What do you think?

251
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,859
This will be better.
Trust me.

252
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,460
Oh, okay, Charlie.

253
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:53,450
- See you tomorrow night, Charlie.
- No you won't.

254
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,768
Got your new wrestling coach coming
over tomorrow night, remember?

255
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:59,338
- Charlie doesn't wrestle.
- I hate wrestling, dad.

256
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,224
Well, that's why
you're going to take lessons.

257
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:03,026
That doesn't make any sense.

258
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:05,612
You need to do something
more physical, okay?

259
00:16:05,614 --> 00:16:07,614
You're wasting too much time
at your computers.

260
00:16:07,616 --> 00:16:10,884
What kind of wrestling coach
comes over on Halloween, anyway?

261
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:13,236
Bye, boys.

262
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:16,239
But dad, we have
a big geometry test coming up.

263
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:19,059
We're in a study group together.
I can't let my friends down.

264
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,711
What about
letting your dad down?

265
00:16:21,713 --> 00:16:24,314
Day after tomorrow,
I promise.

266
00:16:25,668 --> 00:16:27,935
I expect to see an "A"
on that test.

267
00:16:30,555 --> 00:16:33,039
Geometry test, huh?

268
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,658
I know what you guys
are doing.

269
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,460
- You don't know anything.
- Really?

270
00:16:37,462 --> 00:16:41,881
Maybe we should have a talk
with mom and dad then.

271
00:16:41,883 --> 00:16:44,801
I'll do your homework
for a week.

272
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:47,237
You're not getting my bank.

273
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:49,473
I already looked in there.
There's not enough.

274
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:53,110
25 bucks, that's the price
for my silence.

275
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:54,778
I'll kill him for free.

276
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,248
Deal.

277
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,485
Not a word.

278
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,854
And you're doing my homework.

279
00:17:22,373 --> 00:17:24,774
I'm impressed.

280
00:17:24,776 --> 00:17:26,192
Didn't think
you guys would show.

281
00:17:26,194 --> 00:17:28,378
This is a piece of cake.

282
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:35,435
If you're doing this
for my sister, forget about it.

283
00:17:35,437 --> 00:17:37,554
- You got no shot with her.
- I'm doing this

284
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,741
because I'm tired of you guys
always giving us a hard time.

285
00:17:40,743 --> 00:17:43,159
We do this,
you guys back off.

286
00:17:43,161 --> 00:17:45,094
Deal?

287
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:50,316
Deal, but I won't
hold my breath.

288
00:17:50,318 --> 00:17:52,068
Ha!
You clowns ready?

289
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,020
Born ready.

290
00:17:55,156 --> 00:17:58,158
Yeah? Well, talk is cheap,
professor.

291
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,310
Smart money says
you won't make it 'til dark.

292
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,546
I bet they don't
even go inside.

293
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,881
Let's just do this.

294
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,433
Are you sure about this,
Charlie? You don't have to.

295
00:18:07,435 --> 00:18:11,154
Sure he is! The dare is you
stay the entire night.

296
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:13,356
Of course if you decide
to split early,

297
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:16,376
youtube and the whole rest
of the world will be watching.

298
00:18:16,378 --> 00:18:18,778
You guys will be
on hidden cameras all night.

299
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,097
Uh, bye, boys.

300
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:28,888
Can we go now, please?

301
00:19:00,488 --> 00:19:02,989
What are you doing? We didn't
even get to the house yet.

302
00:19:02,991 --> 00:19:06,209
My dad! We're supposed to
be studying for a math test

303
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:08,311
at your house, remember?

304
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,396
Come on, let's go.

305
00:19:26,281 --> 00:19:28,982
Are we almost there yet,
Charlie?

306
00:19:28,984 --> 00:19:31,317
Almost.

307
00:19:45,534 --> 00:19:47,850
Hey, did you read the new
"zombie invasion" comic?

308
00:19:47,852 --> 00:19:49,819
Yes, it's awesome!

309
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:52,021
Dude, it was awesome. I like
"the zombie warrior" better.

310
00:19:52,023 --> 00:19:54,324
Well, yeah,
because that was the first one.

311
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,293
I mean, it's expected.

312
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:16,296
What now?

313
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:20,167
How are we
getting in this place?

314
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,213
Okay, come on.

315
00:20:39,554 --> 00:20:42,389
There, that's our entrance.

316
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:44,690
We pry that wood off
and slip inside.

317
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,830
Let's see here.

318
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,867
We're sure we really
want to do this?

319
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:55,668
Don't chicken out now, Nick.

320
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:58,137
They could be watching us
on those cameras.

321
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,325
No turning back now.

322
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,685
This is way too easy.

323
00:21:12,687 --> 00:21:14,704
This is going
to be an awesome night.

324
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:17,373
Meet up at my place in an hour,
make sure everything's ready.

325
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,709
- I got this.
- Tonight,

326
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:23,779
those dipsticks are going
to get a double dose of ghost.

327
00:21:23,781 --> 00:21:27,750
- Do you guys really have cameras in there?
- Jake's dad works security.

328
00:21:27,752 --> 00:21:30,253
He gave me a few toys. Heighten
the experience a little.

329
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:32,439
Plus we got to make sure
your friends don't wuss out.

330
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:35,341
Don't you think
that's kind of mean, Jake?

331
00:21:35,343 --> 00:21:38,361
Absolutely!

332
00:21:56,097 --> 00:21:58,264
Oh, my face.

333
00:22:04,405 --> 00:22:07,173
Would you get off me, please?

334
00:22:07,175 --> 00:22:08,942
I'm trying!

335
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,484
Man, it's higher
than I thought.

336
00:22:18,486 --> 00:22:21,955
I don't think we could get back out
that way even if we wanted to.

337
00:22:21,957 --> 00:22:23,155
Great!

338
00:22:23,157 --> 00:22:24,691
So we're trapped
in here?

339
00:22:24,693 --> 00:22:26,358
We shouldn't even be here,
Charlie.

340
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,927
This is all your fault.

341
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,329
Yeah, I had my grimm reaper
super-hero costume

342
00:22:30,331 --> 00:22:34,150
all ready to go for tonight.
But no, I'm trapped here

343
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:36,769
in this stupid old
haunted house with you guys!

344
00:22:36,771 --> 00:22:39,706
Would you guys calm down? You
whine worse than my baby brother.

345
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:41,273
So you're calling us babies?

346
00:22:41,275 --> 00:22:44,176
Yeah, snot-nosed
little diaper-wearing babies.

347
00:22:44,178 --> 00:22:46,228
Okay, that's it.

348
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,981
I'm done.
Party's over.

349
00:22:47,983 --> 00:22:49,381
Give me a boost, Nick.

350
00:22:49,383 --> 00:22:51,117
No way,
you give me a boost.

351
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,986
Guys, you really
want to leave?

352
00:22:52,988 --> 00:22:55,855
Aren't you tired of those jerks
always getting the best of us?

353
00:22:55,857 --> 00:22:58,825
This is our chance to show
everyone what we're made of.

354
00:22:58,827 --> 00:23:01,293
We go back out that window now,
we can never show our faces

355
00:23:01,295 --> 00:23:03,062
in the school again.

356
00:23:03,064 --> 00:23:05,732
We can do this,
you know we can.

357
00:23:05,734 --> 00:23:09,169
Unless you really think we're the
gutless losers they say we are.

358
00:23:09,171 --> 00:23:10,904
We're not losers.

359
00:23:10,906 --> 00:23:13,006
So prove it.

360
00:23:14,475 --> 00:23:16,910
Come on, guys.

361
00:23:18,646 --> 00:23:21,948
Forget those guys,
right?

362
00:23:23,885 --> 00:23:25,585
I guess.

363
00:23:27,522 --> 00:23:30,172
Let's take inventory.
Supply check.

364
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,527
I brought the entertainment.

365
00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:38,164
Ipad, video game, dvd,

366
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,833
D.S., and G.P.S.,
just in case.

367
00:23:40,835 --> 00:23:43,720
Oh, and this.

368
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:45,187
Nice touch.

369
00:23:45,189 --> 00:23:47,190
Thought you'd appreciate
the irony.

370
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:49,025
I brought the food.

371
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:52,745
Chips, salsa-not too spicy-
drinks,

372
00:23:52,747 --> 00:23:54,247
chocolate-covered debby cakes,

373
00:23:54,249 --> 00:23:56,349
and my personal favorite,

374
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:59,586
hungry boy
fried chicken dinners.

375
00:23:59,588 --> 00:24:02,054
These are frozen dinners.

376
00:24:02,056 --> 00:24:03,889
They'll thaw out
by the time we eat them.

377
00:24:03,891 --> 00:24:07,327
All right, so I brought
the batteries, matches,

378
00:24:07,329 --> 00:24:09,796
non-drip candles.

379
00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:11,931
No one will ever know
that we were here.

380
00:24:11,933 --> 00:24:13,666
What about the window?

381
00:24:13,668 --> 00:24:15,918
Cat did it.

382
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:20,540
Oh, and these-
standard army flashlights.

383
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,775
- They're the real deal.
- No, thanks.

384
00:24:22,777 --> 00:24:25,077
I have my cactus jack
ranger pocket knife.

385
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:26,546
It has a light
built into it.

386
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,080
Look.

387
00:24:28,082 --> 00:24:30,617
Did you get that
out of cereal box?

388
00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:33,820
- It's for small, tight spaces.
- Like your brain?

389
00:24:33,822 --> 00:24:36,205
Let's just look around
and find a place

390
00:24:36,207 --> 00:24:37,473
to settle down for the night.

391
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:39,608
Maybe we should
just stay right here.

392
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:43,913
In a dusty old basement?
I don't think so.

393
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:47,267
Let's just go. This place
smells like a dungeon.

394
00:24:55,943 --> 00:24:57,943
Ready?

395
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,658
Be quiet,
just in case.

396
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:15,028
Just in case what?

397
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:17,614
In case the bloody, rotting
corpses of the Sullivan Gang

398
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:19,899
- are still living upstairs.
- That's not funny!

399
00:25:19,901 --> 00:25:21,784
Hello?
Anyone home?

400
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:24,653
Are you crazy, Charlie?

401
00:25:24,655 --> 00:25:26,522
It's just us.

402
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:28,257
Let's go.

403
00:25:30,778 --> 00:25:33,563
You guys waiting
for a formal invitation?

404
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,216
Maybe we should go
back downstairs.

405
00:25:37,218 --> 00:25:39,001
They'll never know.

406
00:25:39,003 --> 00:25:41,870
Rangers never retreat.

407
00:26:03,678 --> 00:26:05,728
You guys coming or what?

408
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,397
What do you see?

409
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:10,399
Uh, big empty house.

410
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:11,968
See for yourself.

411
00:26:35,743 --> 00:26:38,111
Whoa, look at that.

412
00:26:38,113 --> 00:26:40,713
Wow!

413
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,101
This is pretty cool.

414
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:48,971
Yeah, see? No ghosts,
no Sullivan Gang, no Salty.

415
00:26:48,973 --> 00:26:51,223
Yeah.

416
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:07,089
Hey, we found a perfect spot
for us.

417
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,295
Oh, and the best part?
After tomorrow,

418
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,697
no more Jake and his meathead
friends bothering us.

419
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,732
I have to admit,

420
00:27:16,734 --> 00:27:19,568
I thought you were out of your
gourd for getting us into this.

421
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:23,639
Yeah, this actually turned out to
be a pretty good idea, Charlie.

422
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:26,276
So, if you Neanderthals
are watching us,

423
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:29,578
hello from the haunted house.

424
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,131
Jake, help us!

425
00:27:32,133 --> 00:27:36,268
Zombies got us and turned us
into the living dead.

426
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:40,456
Yeah! Please tell our teachers we won't
be coming back to school anymore.

427
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:42,492
They can give our homework
to someone else.

428
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,907
You really think the Sullivan
Gang ever lived here?

429
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:00,476
I don't know.
Doesn't really matter, though.

430
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:02,579
I mean, you saw
all the furniture in there.

431
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:05,848
Somebody lived there,
a long time ago, anyway.

432
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:09,201
And besides, there's
no such thing as ghosts.

433
00:28:09,203 --> 00:28:12,438
That's what they always say
in the movies

434
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,091
right before one shows up
and rips their face off.

435
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:35,911
Wow, it's really pretty.

436
00:28:35,913 --> 00:28:37,897
Yeah, just like Brandy Benson.

437
00:28:37,899 --> 00:28:39,666
Don't even, Alex!

438
00:28:39,668 --> 00:28:42,335
Got to admit, Charlie,
we wouldn't be here right now

439
00:28:42,337 --> 00:28:45,071
if Brandy wasn't standing there
yesterday.

440
00:28:45,073 --> 00:28:48,257
Yep, you'd be out trick-or-treating,
just like you always do.

441
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:49,909
What's wrong
with trick-or-treating?

442
00:28:49,911 --> 00:28:51,627
It's for kids.

443
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:53,246
Oh yeah,
so what's that make you?

444
00:28:53,248 --> 00:28:56,299
- Some kind of grown-up?
- Truce, guys.

445
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:58,634
Look at this-
sunset, three friends.

446
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:00,602
This is a total
beer-commercial moment.

447
00:29:00,604 --> 00:29:02,855
You guys are ruining it.

448
00:29:02,857 --> 00:29:05,291
Okay.
But he started it.

449
00:29:06,961 --> 00:29:08,744
And yeah,
Brandy Benson is beautiful.

450
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:39,892
What are you doing?

451
00:29:39,894 --> 00:29:41,293
Tempting fate.

452
00:29:41,295 --> 00:29:43,162
That's what Rangers do.

453
00:29:43,164 --> 00:29:45,448
Dude, that's what idiots do.

454
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,349
Get over here.

455
00:29:49,103 --> 00:29:52,271
- Come on, dude.
- Man, come on.

456
00:29:52,273 --> 00:29:56,525
I don't remember it being this dark in here.

457
00:29:56,527 --> 00:29:57,860
What are you doing now?

458
00:29:57,862 --> 00:30:00,263
Seeing if any
of the light switches work.

459
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:03,432
That would be a great idea if
there were any lights to turn on.

460
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:04,801
But there aren't.

461
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,036
So just stay close,
okay?

462
00:30:33,681 --> 00:30:35,380
Did we leave the door open?

463
00:30:37,151 --> 00:30:40,185
What's that down there?

464
00:30:57,972 --> 00:31:00,372
It's just the wind.

465
00:31:00,374 --> 00:31:03,442
I thought I heard it
say something.

466
00:31:06,547 --> 00:31:08,180
Nick!

467
00:31:08,182 --> 00:31:11,117
I'm coming to get you.

468
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,352
If it gets me,
I promise,

469
00:31:13,354 --> 00:31:15,521
it's getting you first.

470
00:31:35,376 --> 00:31:38,544
That's right, boys.
Make yourselves comfortable.

471
00:31:38,546 --> 00:31:40,462
It's going to be
a bumpy ride.

472
00:31:40,464 --> 00:31:42,364
When do the ghosts arrive?

473
00:31:42,366 --> 00:31:44,066
Hey, patience, amigo.

474
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,201
They'll be making a house call
very soon.

475
00:31:46,203 --> 00:31:48,054
I've got it all wired
into that single unit.

476
00:31:48,056 --> 00:31:49,488
Can control it all
from there.

477
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,023
You promised
I could do this part, Jake.

478
00:31:51,025 --> 00:31:53,709
And I am a man
of my word.

479
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:58,080
I've never eaten
a frozen drumstick before.

480
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:01,284
Just suck on it till it melts.
Then you can bite into it.

481
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:03,669
Sorry, I had to grab
whatever I could

482
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,988
before my mom asked me
where I was going

483
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,924
with three
hungry boy meals.

484
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:12,595
This piece is a little softer.

485
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,264
Kind of slushy.
Not bad.

486
00:32:28,912 --> 00:32:30,946
Get out, Debbie!
Debbie, look out!

487
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:41,089
What?

488
00:32:41,091 --> 00:32:42,958
Nothing.

489
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,711
Sometimes I think
you're a little hard on Charlie.

490
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:47,079
That's all.

491
00:32:47,081 --> 00:32:49,615
No, my old man
was hard on me.

492
00:32:49,617 --> 00:32:51,918
I had a job
when I was 13.

493
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,785
These kids
live lives of leisure.

494
00:32:53,787 --> 00:32:56,288
It wouldn't kill you
to try a little harder.

495
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:57,923
That's all I'm saying.

496
00:32:57,925 --> 00:33:00,259
I asked him to help me
fix the car last weekend.

497
00:33:00,261 --> 00:33:01,994
He said no.
What am I gonna do?

498
00:33:01,996 --> 00:33:04,063
He's a smart kid.

499
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:06,098
He likes what he likes.

500
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,400
Did you ever think maybe
that doesn't include wresting

501
00:33:08,402 --> 00:33:09,969
or fixing the car?

502
00:33:09,971 --> 00:33:13,271
What kids don't like wrestling
and fixing cars?

503
00:33:13,273 --> 00:33:15,558
It might be nice
to take an interest

504
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,593
in the things
that he's interested in.

505
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:20,295
Charlie's growing up.

506
00:33:20,297 --> 00:33:21,463
Todd too.

507
00:33:21,465 --> 00:33:23,432
We have
this tiny little window

508
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:25,634
where they actually
still want to be with us.

509
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:27,686
You're missing it.

510
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,141
Oh, I think Noah
needs a new diaper.

511
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:33,842
Can you smell his butt
for me?

512
00:33:33,844 --> 00:33:35,944
Okay, Todd, let's go!
We're gonna go get dinner.

513
00:33:35,946 --> 00:33:37,279
Get in the car.

514
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:38,581
Aw, man!

515
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:40,182
Shut up, Todd.

516
00:33:53,147 --> 00:33:56,282
- Go on!
- Yeah, do it!

517
00:34:14,518 --> 00:34:17,335
This is so much better
than trick-or-treating.

518
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,340
Ooh, smarties!
Dibs!

519
00:34:27,881 --> 00:34:31,083
Check it out.
I added a skull there.

520
00:34:31,085 --> 00:34:32,918
Plus the hand
coming out of the grave.

521
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,170
Dude, you wrote that
on your science book?

522
00:34:35,172 --> 00:34:39,074
Yeah. It's either that
or study photosynthesis.

523
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:40,959
What if somebody sees it?

524
00:34:42,196 --> 00:34:44,863
You bring "zombie invasion" 33?

525
00:34:44,865 --> 00:34:47,048
Ho ho ho!

526
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:49,218
Who do you think
would win in a fight?

527
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,720
The zombie warrior
or the big plant monster

528
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:53,272
from "tales of terror" 16?

529
00:34:53,274 --> 00:34:54,957
Can't we talk
about something other

530
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:57,610
than that stupid kids' stuff
all the time?

531
00:34:57,612 --> 00:34:59,228
I like being a kid.

532
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:02,698
Yeah, what's so great
about being a grown-up anyway?

533
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,017
The only thing I ever hear
my parents talking about

534
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:09,338
are bills, "how come you didn't stop
at the grocery store on the way home?"

535
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:12,958
Or how to, like, lower your
cholesterol and stuff.

536
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,426
Okay, Mr. Grown-Up.

537
00:35:14,428 --> 00:35:17,496
You promised to tell us
the Brandy story.

538
00:35:17,498 --> 00:35:18,581
Let's hear it.

539
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,382
Yeah, what is it
about that girl

540
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:23,952
that makes you volunteer
to do crazy stuff like this?

541
00:35:23,954 --> 00:35:26,739
It's not normal.

542
00:35:26,741 --> 00:35:29,391
It's not much of a story.

543
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:32,011
Okay, you can hardly remember
your name when she's around.

544
00:35:32,013 --> 00:35:35,030
- That's something.
- Well...

545
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:37,733
it all started-

546
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:39,368
it was last summer.

547
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,320
I was on my way home
from the pool

548
00:35:41,322 --> 00:35:43,772
and I saw Brandy's dad
doing some yard work.

549
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:45,607
And I asked him
if I could give him a hand.

550
00:35:45,609 --> 00:35:49,411
And he said, "sure, come marry
my beautiful daughter."

551
00:35:50,798 --> 00:35:52,464
No!

552
00:35:52,466 --> 00:35:54,149
Then I spent
the next two hours

553
00:35:54,151 --> 00:35:55,551
bagging up all the leaves
and stuff

554
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:56,985
and taking them
out to the curb.

555
00:35:56,987 --> 00:35:58,871
What does that have to do
with Brandy?

556
00:35:58,873 --> 00:36:01,656
Well, when I was finished,
Mr. Benson goes inside,

557
00:36:01,658 --> 00:36:03,575
and a few minutes later...

558
00:36:16,106 --> 00:36:18,424
Brandy comes out to give me
some money for the work.

559
00:36:22,396 --> 00:36:24,446
It was like everything
just stopped.

560
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,958
Then what happened?

561
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,860
Then I said goodbye
and left.

562
00:36:38,862 --> 00:36:41,097
- That's it?
- So she touched your hand

563
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:43,348
and you've been gaga
over her ever since?

564
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:46,518
Pretty much.

565
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,308
What was that?

566
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:55,310
Let's find out.

567
00:36:55,312 --> 00:36:57,479
No way.
I'm staying right here.

568
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,848
Your choice.
We'll be right back.

569
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,117
You guys can't leave me
here alone.

570
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:04,203
Watch us.

571
00:37:04,205 --> 00:37:06,906
All right, then give me
your cactus jack ranger knife.

572
00:37:06,908 --> 00:37:09,875
No way,
I'm coming with you.

573
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:17,015
What are you doing? We're not supposed to
hit them with the big guns till later.

574
00:37:17,017 --> 00:37:18,984
I didn't do anything.
That wasn't me.

575
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:31,480
Odds or even?

576
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:34,132
- What?
- To see who goes in first.

577
00:37:34,134 --> 00:37:36,986
This whole thing
was your idea, fearless leader.

578
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:38,687
I nominate you.

579
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:44,026
Just so you know,

580
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:45,560
if it's some maniac
with a chainsaw,

581
00:37:45,562 --> 00:37:48,097
I'm leaving you guys
in the dust.

582
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:51,901
- Charlie?
- Shh!

583
00:38:04,065 --> 00:38:06,264
You can put the knife away,
goggles.

584
00:38:06,266 --> 00:38:08,734
It's just a branch. Must
have broke off in the wind.

585
00:38:08,736 --> 00:38:12,071
Hey, a Ranger can never
be too careful.

586
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,604
Who got mashed potatoes again?

587
00:38:34,394 --> 00:38:38,981
Get me the six-piece
extra-crispy combo, Russ.

588
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,732
Wings and drumsticks only.

589
00:38:40,734 --> 00:38:43,201
You think you could call me dad,
at least when we're in public?

590
00:38:43,203 --> 00:38:44,987
Okay, dad.

591
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:48,490
White meat, extra sauce.

592
00:38:56,349 --> 00:38:57,783
Can I help you
with something?

593
00:38:57,785 --> 00:38:59,401
You're Brandy Benson.

594
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,738
Do I know you?

595
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,107
You're the screensaver
on my brother's computer.

596
00:39:06,109 --> 00:39:09,178
Your picture,
he stares at it all day.

597
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,431
And your brother is?

598
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:15,884
- Charlie. Charlie Hamilton.
- I told you he was a stalker.

599
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:18,570
You know he's only doing this
to impress you.

600
00:39:18,572 --> 00:39:20,355
What do you mean?

601
00:39:20,357 --> 00:39:23,291
I know all about him spending the
night in the old Sullivan place.

602
00:39:23,293 --> 00:39:26,211
Him and the other two rocket
scientists he hangs out with.

603
00:39:26,213 --> 00:39:29,314
You're prettier in person.

604
00:39:31,768 --> 00:39:33,085
What a weirdo.

605
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:36,471
I'm worried about Charlie.

606
00:39:36,473 --> 00:39:39,858
I should have never let him agree to
this stupid thing in the first place.

607
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,093
First of all,
you didn't let him do anything.

608
00:39:42,095 --> 00:39:44,496
He made his own bed
and now he has to sleep in it.

609
00:39:44,498 --> 00:39:49,101
That bed just happens to be an
incredibly scary old haunted house.

610
00:40:04,351 --> 00:40:05,917
Just lightning.

611
00:40:05,919 --> 00:40:08,853
I think we'll keep this on
just in case.

612
00:40:08,855 --> 00:40:11,923
Just in case what?

613
00:40:13,894 --> 00:40:16,278
That had to be
the basement door, right?

614
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,497
Yeah, it's just the wind.

615
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:24,536
Okay, the wind
blows the door shut.

616
00:40:24,538 --> 00:40:26,254
I heard it slam.

617
00:40:26,256 --> 00:40:29,791
So how exactly does the wind
blow it open again?

618
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:38,250
Okay, Mr. "It's just the wind,"

619
00:40:38,252 --> 00:40:40,502
you want to explain that one
to me?

620
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,924
Your dad's gear
is completely off the hook.

621
00:40:45,926 --> 00:40:47,575
Dude, look at
those little losers.

622
00:40:47,577 --> 00:40:49,111
You got the place
totally rigged.

623
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,746
That's nothing.
Check it out.

624
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:52,848
I bet this scares them
right out of the house.

625
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,723
What was that?

626
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:03,725
Is there someone in here with us?

627
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:05,944
I say we get
the heck out of here.

628
00:41:05,946 --> 00:41:08,513
I've said "uncle"
enough times in my life

629
00:41:08,515 --> 00:41:10,298
to know when to say it,
Charlie.

630
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,133
And this is one
of those times.

631
00:41:12,135 --> 00:41:13,835
He's right.
Let's get out of here, Charlie.

632
00:41:13,837 --> 00:41:16,488
- To heck with the bet.
- I'm not leaving.

633
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:20,159
I've always wondered what a
ghost looked like up close.

634
00:41:20,161 --> 00:41:22,327
- Are you crazy?
- Nope.

635
00:41:22,329 --> 00:41:24,429
I just don't believe
in ghosts.

636
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:33,755
If I don't make it back,

637
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:35,891
make sure Todd doesn't get
my $25.

638
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,286
Gah!

639
00:41:49,556 --> 00:41:52,808
Didn't want you
to have all the fun.

640
00:41:54,194 --> 00:41:56,261
Hello?

641
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,767
Let's run!

642
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:16,982
Help me with this, you guys!

643
00:42:20,887 --> 00:42:23,655
Put your backs up against it!

644
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,495
Turn your light on, Charlie.
I can't see a thing in here.

645
00:42:30,497 --> 00:42:32,397
It's out there.
I dropped it.

646
00:42:32,399 --> 00:42:34,132
Nice going, Charlie!

647
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:35,901
Where's your cactus jack
ranger light?

648
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,468
I left it
in my sleeping bag.

649
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:39,121
Well, we're not getting out
this way.

650
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:41,690
- What time is it?
- What does that matter?!

651
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:44,709
Sunrise is 6:48 a.m.
I looked it up!

652
00:42:44,711 --> 00:42:46,744
I say we stay right here
until it's light.

653
00:42:46,746 --> 00:42:49,297
Then we make a break
for the front door.

654
00:42:49,299 --> 00:42:51,733
Look, if whatever is out there
wanted to hurt us,

655
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,301
it would have done it already.

656
00:42:53,303 --> 00:42:55,170
Maybe it's just trying
to scare us.

657
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:57,272
It's doing a pretty good job.

658
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:09,201
D- d-did you just see that?

659
00:43:09,203 --> 00:43:12,237
That sheet just moved.

660
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:16,991
Maybe it's just the wind
again.

661
00:43:16,993 --> 00:43:19,244
There is no wind
in this room.

662
00:43:19,246 --> 00:43:21,763
What am I looking at?

663
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:25,700
I could have sworn
that thing moved.

664
00:43:25,702 --> 00:43:29,437
Look, there's got to be a logical
explanation for all of this.

665
00:43:29,439 --> 00:43:32,574
This house is really old
and it's got creaks and drafts

666
00:43:32,576 --> 00:43:34,276
and all kinds of crazy stuff.

667
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:37,128
Just like my grandma Arletta.

668
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:46,170
It's moving again.

669
00:43:46,172 --> 00:43:47,955
Didn't we just go through this?

670
00:43:47,957 --> 00:43:49,441
Guys?

671
00:43:51,428 --> 00:43:53,061
Charlie?

672
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:57,132
I think he's right.

673
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:01,153
- Run!
- Which way?

674
00:44:01,155 --> 00:44:02,887
To anywhere but here!

675
00:44:02,889 --> 00:44:04,523
Go!

676
00:44:11,014 --> 00:44:12,714
Oh, are you all right?

677
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:14,416
I tripped over something.

678
00:44:16,804 --> 00:44:18,837
I think you tripped
over this.

679
00:44:21,809 --> 00:44:22,840
What is it?

680
00:44:26,846 --> 00:44:28,730
Come on.

681
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:49,384
Just as I thought.
Jake.

682
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:51,386
Him and his meathead friends
rigged all this up

683
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:53,304
so that we'd leave
and they'd win the bet.

684
00:44:53,306 --> 00:44:55,490
I mean, think about it-
slamming doors,

685
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:58,726
the scary footsteps.
Come on.

686
00:44:58,728 --> 00:45:00,361
Let's see what else
they set up for us.

687
00:45:00,363 --> 00:45:01,697
Yeah.

688
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,465
Maybe we can give them
a little surprise.

689
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:16,344
Carol, we're out of candy.

690
00:45:18,732 --> 00:45:20,515
Mr. Hamilton?

691
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:23,285
There's something
I need to tell you.

692
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:30,091
Whoa whoa, what's going on?

693
00:45:30,093 --> 00:45:31,710
I told you
not to touch anything.

694
00:45:31,712 --> 00:45:33,044
I didn't touch anything.

695
00:45:33,046 --> 00:45:34,946
Well, then what happened
to the picture?

696
00:45:34,948 --> 00:45:37,298
Maybe a ghost got 'em.

697
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:39,751
Very funny.
We're missing all the action.

698
00:45:39,753 --> 00:45:41,919
- Reboot it.
- I did. It's not working.

699
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:46,641
Come on,
let's go get a closer look.

700
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:49,210
Uh, how close exactly?

701
00:45:49,212 --> 00:45:50,829
Front-row seats.

702
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:57,985
So you knew your brother was sneaking
off to pull this crazy stunt

703
00:45:57,987 --> 00:46:00,671
- and you didn't tell anybody?
- Dad, he begged me.

704
00:46:00,673 --> 00:46:02,407
I don't want to hear
another word from you.

705
00:46:02,409 --> 00:46:05,894
$25? Is that what a lie
goes for these days?

706
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:08,112
Mr. Hamilton,
Charlie was really determined.

707
00:46:08,114 --> 00:46:10,882
Charlie and his friends
lied.

708
00:46:10,884 --> 00:46:12,700
What if they got hurt
or they needed help?

709
00:46:12,702 --> 00:46:14,419
I wouldn't even know
where to find them.

710
00:46:14,421 --> 00:46:16,020
Mr. Hamilton.

711
00:46:16,022 --> 00:46:18,155
Didn't you do anything like this
when you were a kid?

712
00:46:18,157 --> 00:46:19,607
My dad was never a kid.

713
00:46:19,609 --> 00:46:22,610
All right,
get in the van, Todd.

714
00:46:22,612 --> 00:46:24,712
I'm not done with you. Come on,
I'll give you a ride home.

715
00:46:24,714 --> 00:46:26,297
And then I'm going
to deal with this nonsense.

716
00:46:26,299 --> 00:46:27,582
Let's go!

717
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:29,717
Watch it, Russ.

718
00:46:32,105 --> 00:46:33,939
There's your Sullivan-Gang
ghosts,

719
00:46:33,941 --> 00:46:36,307
all in one neat little pile.

720
00:46:36,309 --> 00:46:38,276
This is Jake's dad's stuff.

721
00:46:38,278 --> 00:46:40,378
That's how they rigged
the entire house.

722
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,948
It's also how they made
all the doors close and stuff.

723
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:45,316
No ghosts, huh?

724
00:46:45,318 --> 00:46:47,251
You sound disappointed.

725
00:46:47,253 --> 00:46:48,420
A little.

726
00:46:48,422 --> 00:46:50,422
Maybe we should just leave now.

727
00:46:50,424 --> 00:46:51,956
They'll never know
the difference.

728
00:46:51,958 --> 00:46:53,591
Forget about that.

729
00:46:53,593 --> 00:46:55,794
Look, when we walk out of here
tomorrow morning,

730
00:46:55,796 --> 00:46:57,729
I want to see the look
on Jake and his friends' faces

731
00:46:57,731 --> 00:47:00,264
when we throw all of this stuff
right back at 'em.

732
00:47:00,266 --> 00:47:01,900
Neanderthals!

733
00:47:03,804 --> 00:47:05,937
But before we go,
let's take one last look around

734
00:47:05,939 --> 00:47:08,907
to make sure that there aren't
any more surprises.

735
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:11,075
Please?

736
00:47:27,828 --> 00:47:29,628
Come on.

737
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:31,763
Let's check out all the windows
and meet back here.

738
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:33,264
We'll see who has the best view
inside.

739
00:47:33,266 --> 00:47:34,466
And don't make any noise.

740
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:44,843
Those little dorks think
they're so smart, don't they?

741
00:48:02,729 --> 00:48:04,462
You're mad, aren't you?

742
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:06,781
Good night, Brandy.

743
00:48:06,783 --> 00:48:08,783
Sorry you had to get dragged
through all this.

744
00:48:08,785 --> 00:48:10,518
I'm not.

745
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,553
Charlie's my friend.

746
00:48:15,992 --> 00:48:19,194
I know he lied to you, Mr. Hamilton,
but it was for a good reason.

747
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:22,630
Yeah, to prove to those other
kids he's some kind of tough guy.

748
00:48:22,632 --> 00:48:24,466
That's not Charlie,
Mr. Hamilton.

749
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:28,135
I think he did it to prove
to himself he wasn't afraid.

750
00:48:28,137 --> 00:48:31,256
It's not easy
being a kid, you know?

751
00:48:31,258 --> 00:48:33,791
Especially when you're afraid
all the time.

752
00:48:33,793 --> 00:48:36,344
What would you know
about that?

753
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:39,030
I'm scared all the time

754
00:48:39,032 --> 00:48:41,933
that people won't like me,

755
00:48:41,935 --> 00:48:44,502
that I'll disappoint
my parents,

756
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:47,688
that people will realize
I'm a dork

757
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:50,758
just like everybody else
and I won't be popular anymore.

758
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,830
I guess it's tough
being a kid sometimes.

759
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:09,093
That's exactly what I've been
trying to tell you, Russ.

760
00:49:09,095 --> 00:49:11,062
Shut up, Todd.

761
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:20,638
There's nothing back there.

762
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,307
Same here.
Rooms are all empty.

763
00:49:22,309 --> 00:49:24,892
They're in there. I just saw
a flashlight in the hallway.

764
00:49:24,894 --> 00:49:26,894
Hold on, I think
they're coming back.

765
00:49:26,896 --> 00:49:28,530
I think I see something.

766
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:39,407
You hear that?

767
00:49:51,237 --> 00:49:53,137
Go go go! Go go go!

768
00:50:06,787 --> 00:50:08,753
Guess it was nothing.

769
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:11,990
Man, this was so much
more fun than trick-or-treating.

770
00:50:11,992 --> 00:50:13,925
There's always a next year.

771
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:15,610
You'll be 14 next year.

772
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:18,696
Hey, as long as people
are giving out candy,

773
00:50:18,698 --> 00:50:20,515
I'm putting on a costume.

774
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,584
I don't care if I'm 50.

775
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:41,803
What was that?

776
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:43,337
Some kind of
prehistoric monster.

777
00:50:43,339 --> 00:50:45,173
- There's no such thing.
- What was it then?

778
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:47,491
Big teeth, red eyes,
claws to rip your face off.

779
00:50:47,493 --> 00:50:51,696
Whatever it was, those little
twerps are stuck in there with it.

780
00:50:51,698 --> 00:50:53,131
Shouldn't we do something?

781
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:54,465
Yeah.

782
00:50:54,467 --> 00:50:57,234
Yeah, go home
and keep your mouths shut.

783
00:50:57,236 --> 00:51:00,171
Those big shots want to show us
how tough they are?

784
00:51:00,173 --> 00:51:02,006
Now is their chance.

785
00:51:02,008 --> 00:51:05,076
Unless you want to go back
and help them?

786
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:10,164
Yeah, that's what I thought.

787
00:51:10,166 --> 00:51:11,999
Let's go.

788
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:27,699
Okay, this is where
you get out.

789
00:51:27,701 --> 00:51:28,983
Go.

790
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:30,451
What are you gonna do?

791
00:51:30,453 --> 00:51:32,670
I'm not sure yet.

792
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,939
You mean there's a chance
I could still get my $25?

793
00:51:34,941 --> 00:51:37,491
You're such an idiot.

794
00:51:37,493 --> 00:51:40,044
Go in the house and tell your mother
I'll call her in a few minutes.

795
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:46,367
I want to go with you.

796
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:48,235
That's not happening.
Good night.

797
00:51:48,237 --> 00:51:49,387
I'm serious.

798
00:51:49,389 --> 00:51:51,606
So am I!
Go inside.

799
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:54,109
Look, I know I'm not the best
brother a kid could have.

800
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,677
You think?

801
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:57,195
But I do care about Charlie.

802
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:59,013
I want to see if he's okay.

803
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:04,035
Put your seatbelt back on.
We're going.

804
00:52:06,139 --> 00:52:09,673
Okay, so maybe I want
to protect my investment too.

805
00:52:09,675 --> 00:52:12,026
Shut up, Todd.

806
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,674
'Night, guys.

807
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:28,926
Leave your light on, Charlie.

808
00:52:28,928 --> 00:52:31,029
Okay.

809
00:52:31,031 --> 00:52:35,133
Yeah, no more scary
bedtime stories.

810
00:52:35,135 --> 00:52:37,969
I think the excitement's over
for the night.

811
00:52:37,971 --> 00:52:39,303
See you guys in the morning.

812
00:52:39,305 --> 00:52:42,106
Yeah, good night.

813
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:08,532
I think that's a terrible idea.

814
00:53:08,534 --> 00:53:10,585
Look, will you just
listen for one minute?

815
00:53:10,587 --> 00:53:12,253
He lied, Russ.

816
00:53:12,255 --> 00:53:14,422
His friends too.
We have to tell their parents.

817
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:16,424
I'm not condoning
what he did.

818
00:53:16,426 --> 00:53:18,660
If we let him stay the night
in that house,

819
00:53:18,662 --> 00:53:20,345
it's like saying
that lying was okay.

820
00:53:20,347 --> 00:53:23,097
He is gonna be punished,
I promise.

821
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:25,532
Yeah, be tough, Russ.

822
00:53:25,534 --> 00:53:28,236
Zip it
or you're walking home.

823
00:53:29,973 --> 00:53:31,705
I don't know, Russ.

824
00:53:31,707 --> 00:53:34,675
Don't try to tell me
this is some kind of guy thing.

825
00:53:34,677 --> 00:53:36,294
Well, it kind of is.

826
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:38,296
Charlie's friend Brandy
was right.

827
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:41,565
He should stay the night in the
house, see something through.

828
00:53:41,567 --> 00:53:44,252
Maybe he could learn
that way.

829
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:46,520
Honesty is what he needs
to learn.

830
00:53:46,522 --> 00:53:49,207
If he asked us to let him stay
the night in this old house-

831
00:53:49,209 --> 00:53:50,959
we would have said no.

832
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:51,943
Exactly.

833
00:53:51,945 --> 00:53:53,561
He's 13.

834
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:55,530
He's trying to figure out
how to be a man.

835
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:57,798
You told me I should take
interest in what he's doing,

836
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,368
so why don't you let me? Nothing's
going to happen to him.

837
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:02,486
Todd and I are sitting
right outside the door.

838
00:54:02,488 --> 00:54:04,722
If I see any kind of trouble,
I'll pull the plug.

839
00:54:04,724 --> 00:54:06,858
All right, Russ.

840
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:08,960
But this one is on you.

841
00:54:08,962 --> 00:54:11,145
I will see you
in the morning.

842
00:54:13,049 --> 00:54:15,550
Thanks again
for letting me come, Russ.

843
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:19,654
Yeah, well, just keep an eye
on the house.

844
00:54:37,573 --> 00:54:40,425
- Alex, Nick, wake up.
- What's up?

845
00:54:40,427 --> 00:54:42,410
There's something going on
over there.

846
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:45,380
I thought we'd found
all of Jake's little toys.

847
00:54:45,382 --> 00:54:47,365
Well, apparently we didn't.
Go check it out.

848
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:50,467
What are you doing?

849
00:54:50,469 --> 00:54:52,736
I'm getting my Ranger knife.

850
00:54:52,738 --> 00:54:54,471
For what?

851
00:54:54,473 --> 00:54:55,740
You never know.

852
00:54:55,742 --> 00:54:58,926
Hey, danger is my middle name.

853
00:54:58,928 --> 00:55:03,915
Did they-did they drop you
on your head as a kid?

854
00:55:03,917 --> 00:55:05,416
Only once.

855
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:27,522
It is so somebody else's turn.

856
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:31,159
Go ahead,
just do it already.

857
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,558
It must have turned on
by accident.

858
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,894
You guys see a remote
anywhere?

859
00:55:49,896 --> 00:55:54,315
I'm pretty sure this TV was made
before remote controls were invented.

860
00:55:54,317 --> 00:55:57,068
Maybe there was a power surge.

861
00:55:57,070 --> 00:55:59,686
There is no power in this house.
How could there be a power surge?

862
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:04,325
Um, guys?

863
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:07,261
It's not plugged in.

864
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:11,215
Let's not overreact.

865
00:56:11,217 --> 00:56:12,884
How do you explain the TV?

866
00:56:12,886 --> 00:56:14,718
I can't, okay?

867
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:18,956
But it's not the time
to panic.

868
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:22,109
"Dateline Elk Falls."

869
00:56:22,111 --> 00:56:25,029
The tale of a band of notorious
outlaws known as the Sullivan Gang

870
00:56:25,031 --> 00:56:27,431
- appears to be coming to a close.
- It's about the Sullivan Gang!

871
00:56:27,433 --> 00:56:29,783
Local authorities have announced
that they in fact have the Sullivans

872
00:56:29,785 --> 00:56:33,371
wanted in connection with over
30 bank robberies since 1952

873
00:56:33,373 --> 00:56:36,323
surrounded at their hideout
in Elk Falls.

874
00:56:36,325 --> 00:56:39,293
- The Sullivan Gang...
- I think it's time to panic. Let's get out of here.

875
00:56:39,295 --> 00:56:41,011
I'll see you out front!

876
00:56:41,013 --> 00:56:44,549
...sure to be a fateful clash

877
00:56:44,551 --> 00:56:45,916
with local police.

878
00:56:49,522 --> 00:56:51,822
Let me try.

879
00:56:51,824 --> 00:56:53,724
We're locked in.

880
00:56:53,726 --> 00:56:56,394
I'm not liking this
one bit.

881
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:03,016
The back door.
Very slowly.

882
00:57:12,978 --> 00:57:15,696
What the heck is that?

883
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,395
What was that?

884
00:57:31,397 --> 00:57:33,464
I don't know.
You want to go back and ask?

885
00:57:37,853 --> 00:57:39,604
What now?

886
00:57:39,606 --> 00:57:41,606
Put your light on it.

887
00:57:41,608 --> 00:57:44,975
The batteries are dead!
Where's yours?

888
00:57:44,977 --> 00:57:46,360
I left it by my sleeping bag!

889
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:47,962
Nice work, Sherlock!

890
00:57:50,833 --> 00:57:52,099
- Run!
- Where?

891
00:57:52,101 --> 00:57:53,668
This way!

892
00:58:06,482 --> 00:58:07,831
In here quick.

893
00:58:10,169 --> 00:58:12,653
Wait, wait, wait, wait, how do
we know it's safe in there?

894
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:19,326
We'll take our chances!

895
00:58:19,328 --> 00:58:20,694
Me too!

896
00:58:22,931 --> 00:58:24,931
- Lock the door, Alex!
- There is no lock.

897
00:58:27,903 --> 00:58:29,686
I want to go home.

898
00:58:29,688 --> 00:58:31,588
Nothing gets through
this door.

899
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:34,041
What was that? That sure
wasn't Jake and his friends.

900
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:36,443
I don't know
and I don't want to find out.

901
00:58:36,445 --> 00:58:39,379
Go away!
Leave us alone!

902
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:04,054
I think whatever was out there
is gone.

903
00:59:04,056 --> 00:59:06,690
What if it's waiting
for us to open the door?

904
00:59:06,692 --> 00:59:09,343
- We have to open it eventually.
- No we don't.

905
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:11,278
So we stay here until?

906
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,980
College.

907
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:16,334
Or until our parents
come to find us.

908
00:59:16,336 --> 00:59:19,770
- Yeah! Then they kill us.
- Parents I can deal with.

909
00:59:19,772 --> 00:59:23,674
Whatever that thing is, it's
three of us versus one of them.

910
00:59:23,676 --> 00:59:25,710
What exactly
is the "them"?

911
00:59:25,712 --> 00:59:28,245
I don't know, but if we stick
together, we'll be okay.

912
00:59:28,247 --> 00:59:29,913
Not a sound.

913
00:59:35,037 --> 00:59:37,755
We leave this room,
go right,

914
00:59:37,757 --> 00:59:39,840
30 feet to the back door
and then out of here.

915
00:59:39,842 --> 00:59:42,977
- Don't stop for anything.
- What about our stuff?

916
00:59:42,979 --> 00:59:46,347
I don't think your mom
will miss the TV dinners.

917
00:59:51,854 --> 00:59:53,754
Let's go.

918
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:07,602
Charlie?

919
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:22,366
- That was nuts!
- Totally!

920
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:24,385
I've never been so scared
in my life.

921
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:25,652
What was that in there?

922
01:00:25,654 --> 01:00:27,705
A ghost!
Tons of them!

923
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:30,040
I don't know! We didn't exactly
get a very good look at it.

924
01:00:30,042 --> 01:00:32,526
What was that fireball,
or those red eyes

925
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:34,978
or that scratching on the closet door?
That wasn't the wind.

926
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:36,863
What happens
when we see Jake?

927
01:00:36,865 --> 01:00:39,249
We'll worry about that
tomorrow.

928
01:00:39,251 --> 01:00:41,184
Tomorrow should be here
in about two hours.

929
01:00:41,186 --> 01:00:44,004
Well, we'll come back then,
wait for him, and win the bet.

930
01:00:44,006 --> 01:00:45,723
How do you figure that?

931
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:48,158
Well, we took out all of
Jake's cameras and stuff

932
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,944
so now they won't have any idea that
we're not in the house anymore.

933
01:00:50,946 --> 01:00:53,447
Let's go home, boys.

934
01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:55,783
Yeah.

935
01:01:00,506 --> 01:01:03,690
Hey, you coming or what?

936
01:01:03,692 --> 01:01:06,927
- I have to go back in there.
- What are you talking about?

937
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:08,729
I left my jacket. I have to
go back in there and get it.

938
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:11,014
It's just a jacket, Alex.

939
01:01:11,016 --> 01:01:13,067
I can't leave it.
Who knows what'll happen to it?

940
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:15,569
Well, whatever happens to it
is going to happen to you too.

941
01:01:15,571 --> 01:01:18,055
- I mean, maybe when it's light-
- I'm not asking you to come.

942
01:01:18,057 --> 01:01:20,023
What's the problem?

943
01:01:20,025 --> 01:01:23,377
Alex wants to go back in there
and get his raggedy old jacket.

944
01:01:23,379 --> 01:01:25,996
It's my good-luck jacket.
I'm not leaving without it.

945
01:01:25,998 --> 01:01:27,815
Look, what is it
with that jacket, Alex?

946
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:29,066
It's special.

947
01:01:29,068 --> 01:01:30,484
It's falling apart.

948
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:32,920
Okay?
You wear it every single day.

949
01:01:32,922 --> 01:01:34,822
It's my brother's, Charlie.

950
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:36,891
He's deployed overseas.

951
01:01:36,893 --> 01:01:39,310
We don't get to hear
from him. Half the time,

952
01:01:39,312 --> 01:01:40,761
we don't even know
where he is.

953
01:01:40,763 --> 01:01:43,147
So as long
as I'm wearing that jacket,

954
01:01:43,149 --> 01:01:44,414
I know he's safe.

955
01:01:45,951 --> 01:01:47,851
I'm going.

956
01:01:47,853 --> 01:01:49,686
Alex.

957
01:01:54,694 --> 01:01:57,160
Come on.

958
01:01:58,814 --> 01:02:01,198
Alex, wait up.

959
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,584
What are you guys doing?

960
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:05,302
We're in this together,
remember?

961
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:07,704
Friends till the end.

962
01:02:07,706 --> 01:02:10,374
Yeah.

963
01:02:10,376 --> 01:02:13,027
Don't sound so excited,
goggles.

964
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:15,779
Let's just get your jacket
and get out of here.

965
01:02:15,781 --> 01:02:17,364
Do you remember
where you left it?

966
01:02:17,366 --> 01:02:19,583
It should be right next
to my sleeping bag,

967
01:02:19,585 --> 01:02:21,936
unless that thing
got its claws on it.

968
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:27,908
All quiet.
Let's go.

969
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:30,243
Hey, Charlie?

970
01:02:30,245 --> 01:02:32,196
Thanks for coming back for me.

971
01:02:54,703 --> 01:02:57,404
Those things
won't do you any good

972
01:02:57,406 --> 01:02:59,406
against a ghost.

973
01:02:59,408 --> 01:03:01,158
How do you know?

974
01:03:02,394 --> 01:03:04,327
Good point.

975
01:03:53,129 --> 01:03:56,296
- It's not here!
- What do you mean it's not here?

976
01:03:56,298 --> 01:03:59,917
- You sure this is where you left it?
- I'm sure.

977
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:01,902
Hurry up, guys!
Come on, let's go!

978
01:04:01,904 --> 01:04:05,405
At least your flashlight
still works.

979
01:04:05,407 --> 01:04:08,225
It's not showing
another rerun, is it?

980
01:04:08,227 --> 01:04:11,078
Man, I'd really like to know how that
thing turned off and on all by itself.

981
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:13,931
Yeah! Or where
that fireball came from.

982
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:15,649
And those eyes!

983
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:17,451
Maybe we didn't find it all.

984
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:20,020
Jake's stuff, I mean!
Maybe there's still more.

985
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:22,773
Come on, Alex!
Hurry up, let's go.

986
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:24,958
I'm not leaving here
without my jacket.

987
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:27,261
Then maybe we should each
split up and take a room.

988
01:04:27,263 --> 01:04:30,130
Have you ever actually
seen a war movie, Charlie?

989
01:04:30,132 --> 01:04:33,383
No way! I'm staying with you
and that flashlight.

990
01:04:33,385 --> 01:04:34,618
Then come on.

991
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:32,760
Ahh!
Another ghost!

992
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:35,463
Wait a second.

993
01:05:43,372 --> 01:05:45,806
You can open your eyes now,
Rambo.

994
01:05:52,014 --> 01:05:54,081
Oh.

995
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:00,670
There it is!

996
01:06:03,442 --> 01:06:05,308
My jacket.

997
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:08,045
You sure you didn't drop it
when we ran out of here?

998
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:09,563
Yeah, I'm sure.

999
01:06:09,565 --> 01:06:11,298
Then how did it get there?

1000
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:15,535
Guys, we walked right
by here when we came back in.

1001
01:06:15,537 --> 01:06:17,271
It wasn't there.
We would have seen it.

1002
01:06:17,273 --> 01:06:19,473
Maybe we just missed it.

1003
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:21,575
Or maybe something
put it there

1004
01:06:21,577 --> 01:06:23,310
after we ran in,

1005
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:27,982
meaning whatever it is,
it's still in the house with us.

1006
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:29,483
You got a better explanation?

1007
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:31,285
Come on, Charlie.

1008
01:06:31,287 --> 01:06:34,088
Let's just get the heck
out of this spooky old dump!

1009
01:06:39,895 --> 01:06:42,796
I think you made
the spooky old dump mad.

1010
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:45,398
Come on!

1011
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,840
Try one of the windows!

1012
01:06:57,079 --> 01:06:59,213
I can't get it off!

1013
01:07:09,542 --> 01:07:10,924
Just stay calm!

1014
01:07:10,926 --> 01:07:12,626
They're trying
to scare us again.

1015
01:07:12,628 --> 01:07:14,628
Yeah? Well, they're doing
a pretty good job of it.

1016
01:07:21,386 --> 01:07:24,104
Just stay close
and don't move.

1017
01:07:24,106 --> 01:07:26,723
We'll be fine as long
as we cover each other's backs.

1018
01:07:29,495 --> 01:07:32,413
Charlie, you may want to reconsider
that whole "don't move" thing.

1019
01:07:34,367 --> 01:07:36,533
There are those eyes again.

1020
01:07:59,074 --> 01:08:00,991
My mom's gonna kill me.

1021
01:08:00,993 --> 01:08:02,475
Come on!

1022
01:08:11,553 --> 01:08:13,570
Let us out of here!

1023
01:08:13,572 --> 01:08:17,024
I'll even give you my cactus
jack knife if you want!

1024
01:08:17,026 --> 01:08:19,893
Just leave us alone!

1025
01:08:24,232 --> 01:08:26,716
- Alex!
- Something's got my foot!

1026
01:08:26,718 --> 01:08:29,219
- What is it?
- How should I know?

1027
01:08:29,221 --> 01:08:31,337
Help me, Charlie!
Do something!

1028
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:41,031
You guys?

1029
01:08:42,468 --> 01:08:45,619
Alex, can you hear me?
Hang on!

1030
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:47,704
I told you we shouldn't
have come back in here.

1031
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:49,856
- Just help me, will you?
- In fact,

1032
01:08:49,858 --> 01:08:52,576
we never even should have
come here in the first place.

1033
01:08:52,578 --> 01:08:54,878
This is all your fault,
Charlie.

1034
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:58,331
I should be home right now eating
Halloween candy 'til I puke.

1035
01:08:58,333 --> 01:09:01,418
But no! You had to
take that stupid dare.

1036
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:03,553
It's not the time, Nick!
Alex is in trouble.

1037
01:09:03,555 --> 01:09:05,806
In case you hadn't noticed,
so are we!

1038
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:08,726
Charlie, you guys! Help!

1039
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:13,429
Snap out of it! That thing
out there has our friend,

1040
01:09:13,431 --> 01:09:14,965
and he needs our help!

1041
01:09:14,967 --> 01:09:17,533
Now help me with the door.

1042
01:09:23,458 --> 01:09:27,578
"This job definitely isn't worth
eleven five a year."

1043
01:09:28,981 --> 01:09:31,748
"Ghostbusters"?

1044
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:33,900
You are so weird.

1045
01:09:41,727 --> 01:09:44,344
Remind me again
why we're doing this.

1046
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:46,847
So I can see the look
on my brother's face

1047
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:49,282
when Charlie and his friends
walk out of that house.

1048
01:09:49,284 --> 01:09:52,052
What makes you so sure
they actually stayed the night?

1049
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:55,338
They're not exactly the bravest bunch
of seventh graders I've ever seen.

1050
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:56,873
Because I know Charlie.

1051
01:09:56,875 --> 01:10:00,643
He's sweet and he always
sticks to his word.

1052
01:10:00,645 --> 01:10:03,580
Be quiet
and don't wake up my parents.

1053
01:10:11,723 --> 01:10:13,123
Alex?

1054
01:10:14,893 --> 01:10:17,294
Can you hear me?

1055
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:19,830
Where are you?

1056
01:10:21,483 --> 01:10:22,983
Ooh!

1057
01:10:30,142 --> 01:10:32,176
Holy smokes.

1058
01:10:48,376 --> 01:10:51,244
Charlie, check it out.

1059
01:10:51,246 --> 01:10:52,429
The sun's finally up.

1060
01:10:59,889 --> 01:11:01,922
Will you get back?

1061
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:06,093
You think they're
still in there?

1062
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:07,460
Would you be?

1063
01:11:10,482 --> 01:11:12,933
- Alex, are you in there?
- Yeah, I'm in here.

1064
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:16,352
But you won't believe
what I'm looking at.

1065
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:32,885
Check, please.

1066
01:11:35,841 --> 01:11:38,308
Okay, new plan-
we go home,

1067
01:11:38,310 --> 01:11:39,977
forget this night
ever happened,

1068
01:11:39,979 --> 01:11:42,595
and start looking
for a new best friend.

1069
01:11:44,149 --> 01:11:45,999
Was that-

1070
01:11:46,001 --> 01:11:48,351
Salty.

1071
01:11:48,353 --> 01:11:50,254
The Sullivan Gang's dog?

1072
01:11:50,256 --> 01:11:53,240
Didn't he rip people to shreds
who crossed the gang?

1073
01:11:53,242 --> 01:11:56,460
- Shut up, Nick!
- Well, that's what the story said.

1074
01:11:56,462 --> 01:11:58,261
Alex, can you move?

1075
01:11:58,263 --> 01:12:00,413
It won't let me.

1076
01:12:00,415 --> 01:12:02,265
We've got to do something.

1077
01:12:02,267 --> 01:12:04,300
I got an idea!

1078
01:12:04,302 --> 01:12:07,270
Uh...

1079
01:12:08,323 --> 01:12:10,907
fetch, doggie.

1080
01:12:13,278 --> 01:12:17,130
Well, it was worth a try!

1081
01:12:17,132 --> 01:12:18,931
We need a diversion.
We need something

1082
01:12:18,933 --> 01:12:21,268
that will give us enough time
to get Alex out of there.

1083
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:23,287
Uh, give me a phone.

1084
01:12:23,289 --> 01:12:25,489
I'll call in an air strike!

1085
01:12:25,491 --> 01:12:27,124
I've got an idea!

1086
01:12:38,587 --> 01:12:40,687
Coffee.

1087
01:12:43,959 --> 01:12:46,259
I don't think
I can do this, Charlie.

1088
01:12:46,261 --> 01:12:48,361
Whatever happened
to "Rangers never retreat,"

1089
01:12:48,363 --> 01:12:50,196
tempting fate
and all that stuff?

1090
01:12:50,198 --> 01:12:52,866
Whatever happened
to "live to see 14"?

1091
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:56,302
This has got to be the dumbest
thing I've ever done.

1092
01:12:56,304 --> 01:12:59,439
Nope, it's the bravest.
Come on.

1093
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:09,432
You guys!

1094
01:13:09,434 --> 01:13:13,470
Ahh!

1095
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:16,957
- Are you okay?
- I think so.

1096
01:13:16,959 --> 01:13:20,276
Ahh!

1097
01:13:20,278 --> 01:13:23,413
Charlie!

1098
01:13:23,415 --> 01:13:26,115
Come on!

1099
01:13:27,436 --> 01:13:29,652
Hey!

1100
01:13:29,654 --> 01:13:33,339
Over here!

1101
01:13:43,251 --> 01:13:45,184
Get away from me!

1102
01:13:52,427 --> 01:13:55,278
Sit!

1103
01:14:17,753 --> 01:14:19,919
Charlie!

1104
01:14:21,873 --> 01:14:25,075
Easy, boy.

1105
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:35,301
It's not working, Charlie!

1106
01:14:36,605 --> 01:14:40,106
Sit!

1107
01:14:40,108 --> 01:14:42,108
That's it.

1108
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:45,245
Good boy.

1109
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:47,046
What's he doing?

1110
01:14:47,048 --> 01:14:48,948
He's a dog.

1111
01:14:48,950 --> 01:14:51,984
A dog needs a friend.

1112
01:14:54,422 --> 01:14:56,673
Attaboy.

1113
01:14:56,675 --> 01:14:59,559
Awesome.

1114
01:14:59,561 --> 01:15:00,677
See that?

1115
01:15:00,679 --> 01:15:02,712
We didn't mean you any harm.

1116
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:15,392
Man's best friend, right?

1117
01:15:15,394 --> 01:15:18,011
Let's just get out stuff
and get out of here.

1118
01:15:30,959 --> 01:15:33,693
Don't forget your Ranger knife,
goggles.

1119
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:35,845
Just in case.

1120
01:15:35,847 --> 01:15:38,515
You think that thing
was really a ghost?

1121
01:15:38,517 --> 01:15:41,601
There's no such thing
as ghosts, remember?

1122
01:15:44,639 --> 01:15:46,756
Besides, who'd believe us
anyway?

1123
01:15:51,463 --> 01:15:54,997
This was the craziest adventure
we've ever had.

1124
01:15:54,999 --> 01:15:56,732
Yeah, and the coolest.

1125
01:15:56,734 --> 01:15:59,235
What are we going
to tell everybody at school?

1126
01:15:59,237 --> 01:16:01,487
Nothing.
It was a piece of cake.

1127
01:16:03,425 --> 01:16:04,424
Hey, I've got an idea.

1128
01:16:04,426 --> 01:16:06,292
No more bets, please.

1129
01:16:06,294 --> 01:16:07,910
This will be even better.

1130
01:16:07,912 --> 01:16:10,146
So we spread the word around

1131
01:16:10,148 --> 01:16:12,315
that if we,
the lowly geek squad,

1132
01:16:12,317 --> 01:16:14,417
can spend the night
in this place,

1133
01:16:14,419 --> 01:16:16,752
that Jake and his friends shouldn't
be afraid to do it either.

1134
01:16:16,754 --> 01:16:20,122
Yeah, I heard Jake's
a dog person.

1135
01:16:23,428 --> 01:16:25,011
Do you think
it'll let us out?

1136
01:16:44,499 --> 01:16:48,768
Uh... uh-oh, Charlie.
It's your dad.

1137
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:50,286
Todd must've squealed.

1138
01:16:50,288 --> 01:16:51,821
What are you
going to tell him?

1139
01:16:51,823 --> 01:16:53,940
The truth, I guess.

1140
01:16:53,942 --> 01:16:57,177
Well, most of it anyway.

1141
01:16:57,179 --> 01:16:59,412
Time to face the music.

1142
01:17:05,236 --> 01:17:06,836
Morning, fellas.

1143
01:17:06,838 --> 01:17:08,020
Hey, dad.

1144
01:17:08,022 --> 01:17:09,923
Morning, Mr. Hamilton.

1145
01:17:09,925 --> 01:17:12,258
So how was your study group
last night?

1146
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:15,261
I'm really sorry.
It's kind of a long story.

1147
01:17:15,263 --> 01:17:18,130
I know.
I heard the whole thing.

1148
01:17:18,132 --> 01:17:19,332
Todd!

1149
01:17:19,334 --> 01:17:21,084
It wasn't me this time,
I swear.

1150
01:17:21,086 --> 01:17:22,836
For once, he's actually
telling the truth.

1151
01:17:22,838 --> 01:17:25,221
Your friend Brandy
came over last night.

1152
01:17:25,223 --> 01:17:29,058
- She told me the whole story.
- She came to our house?

1153
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:31,578
Yeah. Personally, I think
she has a crush on me.

1154
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:34,097
But don't worry, Charlie.
I'll let her down easy.

1155
01:17:34,099 --> 01:17:35,414
- Todd.
- What?

1156
01:17:35,416 --> 01:17:37,217
Oh yeah, right, sorry.

1157
01:17:39,704 --> 01:17:42,388
She's a nice girl, Charlie.

1158
01:17:42,390 --> 01:17:45,792
I'm sorry
that I lied to you, dad.

1159
01:17:45,794 --> 01:17:47,994
Sorry about the whole thing.

1160
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:50,680
I know, and you're grounded
for lying, kiddo.

1161
01:17:50,682 --> 01:17:52,882
And I'm sure you guys are too
once your parents find out.

1162
01:17:52,884 --> 01:17:55,034
Yes, Mr. Hamilton.

1163
01:17:57,572 --> 01:17:59,689
But I'm proud of you too.

1164
01:17:59,691 --> 01:18:01,791
Thanks, dad.

1165
01:18:01,793 --> 01:18:05,428
You boys must have had quite an
experience in there last night, huh?

1166
01:18:07,248 --> 01:18:10,183
Nothing we couldn't handle.

1167
01:18:13,555 --> 01:18:16,372
All right, let's go, boys.
Let's get you home. Come on.

1168
01:18:16,374 --> 01:18:20,192
Hey, uh, do you mind
if we walk?

1169
01:18:20,194 --> 01:18:22,128
I'll come straight home,
I promise.

1170
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:23,263
All right, but straight home.

1171
01:18:23,265 --> 01:18:24,964
All right? Let's go.

1172
01:18:24,966 --> 01:18:27,416
Sorry, bro.

1173
01:18:27,418 --> 01:18:30,136
Wow, I must be hearing things.

1174
01:18:30,138 --> 01:18:33,222
We can discuss the matter
of my $25 later.

1175
01:18:33,224 --> 01:18:35,642
Todd! Van now.

1176
01:18:46,304 --> 01:18:48,737
Oh yeah,
and if your mom asks,

1177
01:18:48,739 --> 01:18:51,190
you tell her I got real angry
and I couldn't stop yelling,

1178
01:18:51,192 --> 01:18:53,292
just like I always do,
all right?

1179
01:18:53,294 --> 01:18:55,311
It's our secret, dad.

1180
01:18:55,313 --> 01:18:56,979
All right.

1181
01:18:56,981 --> 01:18:59,482
You know, since you're
in such a forgiving mood, Russ,

1182
01:18:59,484 --> 01:19:01,917
there's this letter that got
sent home with me from school

1183
01:19:01,919 --> 01:19:03,919
that I've been meaning
to talk to you about.

1184
01:19:03,921 --> 01:19:05,321
- Todd?
- Yeah?

1185
01:19:05,323 --> 01:19:06,889
Shut up.

1186
01:19:17,001 --> 01:19:20,536
Wow, your dad's
full of surprises.

1187
01:19:23,892 --> 01:19:27,009
Yeah, seems to be
the night for it.

1188
01:19:27,011 --> 01:19:29,796
Hi, Charlie.

1189
01:19:29,798 --> 01:19:31,113
Hey.
What are you guys doing here?

1190
01:19:31,115 --> 01:19:32,899
She's waiting for you,
stupid.

1191
01:19:34,368 --> 01:19:37,503
I told your dad.
I'm so sorry.

1192
01:19:37,505 --> 01:19:41,557
It's okay. He was actually
kind of cool about it.

1193
01:19:41,559 --> 01:19:43,192
I was just worried.

1194
01:19:43,194 --> 01:19:45,495
About me?
No, I mean, about us?

1195
01:19:45,497 --> 01:19:48,515
- I mean, you were-
- Well, I was.

1196
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:50,684
- Um, I mean, like-
- this is so stupid.

1197
01:19:50,686 --> 01:19:52,167
Look, you like her,
she likes you.

1198
01:19:52,169 --> 01:19:53,636
Just say it already.

1199
01:19:53,638 --> 01:19:55,789
Angela!

1200
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:58,792
You're the one they always
call "goggles," right?

1201
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:01,027
Yeah.

1202
01:20:01,029 --> 01:20:03,329
You're actually kind of cute
without your glasses.

1203
01:20:06,084 --> 01:20:08,217
Hey, brainiac!

1204
01:20:14,559 --> 01:20:16,909
I never said
I couldn't catch a football.

1205
01:20:16,911 --> 01:20:18,310
You did.

1206
01:20:18,312 --> 01:20:19,996
You guys actually
stuck it out, huh?

1207
01:20:19,998 --> 01:20:22,782
Yeah.
That was the bet, right?

1208
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:24,450
And it's "Charlie,"

1209
01:20:24,452 --> 01:20:27,970
not brainiac
or dork or geek-boy!

1210
01:20:27,972 --> 01:20:30,089
- Yeah.
- Hey, shut up, Brent.

1211
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:32,458
I'll remember that.

1212
01:20:34,278 --> 01:20:35,595
Come on, guys.

1213
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:39,065
See you around, Charlie.

1214
01:20:41,252 --> 01:20:43,620
I can't believe it.

1215
01:20:43,622 --> 01:20:46,505
- He actually seemed-
- Nice.

1216
01:20:46,507 --> 01:20:48,257
I was going to say
"Magnanimous."

1217
01:20:48,259 --> 01:20:50,493
But then I thought
he might hear me

1218
01:20:50,495 --> 01:20:53,963
and come back and do that
hitting-us-on-every-syllable thing again.

1219
01:20:53,965 --> 01:20:56,131
Let's just go home.

1220
01:21:04,042 --> 01:21:05,891
Who's this?

1221
01:21:05,893 --> 01:21:08,310
- I don't know.
- Does he have a tag?

1222
01:21:08,312 --> 01:21:11,064
- What's his name?
- I don't see one.

1223
01:21:11,066 --> 01:21:13,833
How about "Salty"?

1224
01:21:13,835 --> 01:21:17,003
He sure acts
like he knows you, Charlie.

1225
01:21:17,005 --> 01:21:19,705
He's so cute!

1226
01:21:19,707 --> 01:21:21,925
What a good boy.

1227
01:21:21,927 --> 01:21:24,543
Can we go home now, please?

1228
01:21:34,489 --> 01:21:36,005
Come on, boy.

1229
01:21:42,413 --> 01:21:44,380
Thanks for coming back
for me.

1230
01:21:44,382 --> 01:21:47,650
Uh, Charlie
sort of made me do it.

1231
01:21:47,652 --> 01:21:51,086
Boy, when that old TV
came on by itself...

1232
01:21:51,088 --> 01:21:52,805
...or that fireball.

1233
01:21:52,807 --> 01:21:56,492
Man! That was the ugliest
ghost I've ever seen.

1234
01:21:56,494 --> 01:21:58,561
Dude, that was the only ghost
you've ever seen.

1235
01:21:58,563 --> 01:22:00,263
What are they talking about?

1236
01:22:00,265 --> 01:22:02,648
Just an old ghost story.

1237
01:22:02,650 --> 01:22:05,568
What did he mean when he said,
"thanks for coming back for me"?

1238
01:22:05,570 --> 01:22:06,836
Tell me, Charlie.

1239
01:22:06,838 --> 01:22:08,254
Really.

1240
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:12,191
Did something happen
in that house last night?

1241
01:22:12,193 --> 01:22:13,393
Yeah.

1242
01:22:13,395 --> 01:22:14,961
I learned
who my real friends are.

1243
01:22:20,451 --> 01:22:22,218
And I don't care what Jake

1244
01:22:22,220 --> 01:22:24,353
or any of his friends
or anyone else says.

1245
01:22:24,355 --> 01:22:26,122
I'm Charlie Hamilton

1246
01:22:26,124 --> 01:22:29,092
and I like math
and science and "D&D"

1247
01:22:29,094 --> 01:22:30,793
and old monster movies.

1248
01:22:30,795 --> 01:22:32,929
And I think
that's pretty cool.

1249
01:22:32,931 --> 01:22:34,463
So do I.

1250
01:22:40,254 --> 01:22:44,324
Well, anyway, it must have
been pretty exciting.

1251
01:22:45,877 --> 01:22:47,777
Are you going to keep him?

1252
01:22:47,779 --> 01:22:49,679
Sure.

1253
01:22:49,681 --> 01:22:53,382
Unless someone else
comes to get him.

1254
01:23:14,004 --> 01:23:16,355
Good boy, come on!
Come on!

1254
