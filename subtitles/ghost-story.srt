So he smoothed out the soil...

And set the cross back upright
at the head of the grave,

to his bed.

- No.
- Good.

01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:15,576
You mean nobody ever
showed up askin' about her ?

942
01:30:15,576 --> 01:30:18,579
It was as if she
had never been here.

943
01:30:18,579 --> 01:30:21,082
As if it had
never happened.

944
01:30:21,082 --> 01:30:24,085
As if we had dreamed
the whole affair.

945
01:30:24,085 --> 01:30:26,587
Ah, what about the car ?

946
01:30:27,088 --> 01:30:29,590
Still at the bottom
of the dedham pond.

947
01:30:31,592 --> 01:30:34,095
And you stayed here ?
You never left.

948
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:37,098
We couldn't.
Not for long, anyway.

949
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:41,102
What else could we have done ?
Ruined four more lives ?

950
01:30:41,602 --> 01:30:44,605
Could have gone to the police
and taken our chances.

951
01:30:44,605 --> 01:30:48,109
Instead, we did this...
Obscene thing.

- And that somehow or other
  she's come back to us, huh ?
- Yeah.

So do i.

955
01:31:03,624 --> 01:31:08,129
I think maybe by growin' old,

956
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:12,133
maybe the forces, or whatever
the hell you want to call them,
have increased.

957
01:31:12,133 --> 01:31:14,635
And these stories
 and these nightmares--

01:31:14,635 --> 01:31:18,639
- Maybe the guilt--
- Is that what killed edward ?

you're going ?

Ah.  you'll do
no such thing.

967
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:10,191
You'll march right back
upstairs before you
catch pneumonia.

- But I have to go out.
- Where ?

01:32:16,697 --> 01:32:20,201
You infuriate me
with your secrets.

970
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:24,205
I've been married to you
for 32 years,

971
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:28,709
and I'm no closer to you
than the day we were married.

972

I'll tell you in the spring.

973
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:33,214
I'm going to take you
to the south of france,

I never thought
i'd set foot
in this house again.

If only we'd been 30
instead of 20.

979
01:33:20,428 --> 01:33:23,431
Oh, what fools
we were.

980
01:33:23,431 --> 01:33:25,433
I don't think
anybody's here.

981
01:33:25,433 --> 01:33:28,936
She's here.
I'm sure of it.

You want to try
upstairs ?

983
01:33:35,943 --> 01:33:39,447
Nothing will come of this.

Do you want to stay
downstairs, Mr. James ?

985
01:33:45,953 --> 01:33:48,456
Not on your life.

[ ricky ]
it's hard to believe, but
all this was so beautiful then.

I'll be back with help
as soon as I can.

I could never make him
do anything he didn't
want to do.

Yeah.

No, you scamp.

It's sears.
I'm worried about him.

A lot of people think I take
too much guff from him,
but I don't mind that.
