But, Father Fitzgibbon,
why do you want a new furnace?

4
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,752
Because, Mr. Haines, last winter,
in the month of November alone...

5
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,479
four of me parishioners
took to the bed with pneumonia.

It's only by a miracle
that I meself pulled through.

But, Father, I didn't come here
to put in new furnaces.

11
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,470
I think you ought to give him
his furnace, Dad.

12
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,996
It would warm people's hearts,
and maybe his collections would be bigger.

No, Son. Improvements are out.

Well, no.

All right, then, I'll do the talking.
How does your new pastor impress you?

156
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,551
You're a big help. It's a little early to say.

157

No, I think it would be better
if I told you when I saw you.

160
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,710
Yes, it would be much better.

161
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,037
All right, Timmy, make it soon, huh?
So long.

162
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,440
- He's a great little man.
- Yeah.

00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,077
What were we talking about?
Yes, I was going to ask...

164
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,589
You were going to ask me
if I want to see the church.

165
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,591
- Yes, that's right.

- Forty-five years.

- And the...
- Forty-six in October.

- The church?
- Same. I built it.

171
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,791
I can only hope someday I can say
I built as much.

172
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,673
- This is nice.
- Yeah, the birds like it.

It's been hard work, but it's been worth it.

I think you'll find this a very pleasant place
in which to meditate.

is a loudspeaker system.

a four-leaf clover. Guess it just isn't my day.

is his fish pole?

- Been to market?

00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:07,269
Mrs. Carmody could attend to that.

A fine Christian woman, Mrs. McGonigle.

it's a nice big jar of brandied peaches.

Well, now, about your golf.
Of course, I can't answer for you...

for games of golf and such like.

is that you wouldn't have time for it, either.

It's lucky for me then that I'm at St. Francis.

When I had my talk with the Bishop,
it was our understanding...

254
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,234
that Father Fitzgibbon
was to remain here as pastor...

255
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,074
and I was to try and straighten out
St. Dominic's without hurting his feelings.

256
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,836
I see. You're in charge, but you're not.
I don't think I'd like an assignment like that.

- All churches have mortgages.

It isn't respectable
for a church not to have one.

- My name's O'Malley.
- Mine's Haines.

Nice meeting you. We may have to
touch you for a little more a little later on.

281
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,472
Hello, Father.
Mrs. Quimp and I were just discussing you.

282
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,552
- You were?
- As you know, I represent...

283
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,835
the Knickerbocker Savings
and Loan Company.

284
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,354
Inasmuch as Mrs. Quimp
declines to pay her rent...

285
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,431
the Knickerbocker Savings
and Loan Company...

286
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,354
- refuses to offer her any further hospitality.
- Is she very far in arrears?

287
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,715
TED: Mrs. Quimp has paid us nothing
for six months.

288
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,473
O'MALLEY: It's certainly very nice of you
to show her leniency.

289
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,472
Supposing the poor old woman
has no place to go?

290
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,678
The Knickerbocker Savings and Loan
Company is not a charitable institution...

291
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,432
like St. Dominic's.

292
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,233
With us, it's just a matter
of cold-blooded business.

293
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,108
With you it's different. You haven't got
anything and you don't want anything.

294
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,839
That's your business
and people respect you for it.

295
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,717
But I'm not in your business, see?

296
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,554
If I haven't got anything
and don't want anything, I'm a bum.

297
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,235
Surely there must be something
we can do about it.

298
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,393
I don't know what you'll do about it, but
I'm going to throw her right out on her ear.

Give her a month to make good in.

- St. Dominic's?

I can see you haven't been around long.

302
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,559
Why, St. Dominic's is in worse shape
than Mrs. Quimp.

- Your father holds the mortgage?

You're darn right he does.

305
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,074
Confidentially,
he'd like to find a way to foreclose.

306
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,993
He wants to tear down the church
and make a parking lot of it.

307
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,072
Can you imagine it?
He's a very disliked man.

308
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,511

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,833
That's a fine fat bird you have there.

315
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,070
We was sort of bringing it over for you.

316
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,357
- It's sort of a present. Ain't it, Herman?
- Yeah.

317
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,069
That's very generous of you.
Such a fine bird and all.

318
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,154
Now, where may I ask did you get it?

319
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,118
- We got...
- We won it in a raffle over at the theatre.

320
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,112
- We were lucky.
- Isn't that great?

- Except on Christmas, Ma don't like turkey.

- She don't?
- Honest.

323

That's most fortunate for me.

There's nothing I'm more partial to
than a nice tom turkey.

around here named Tony Scaponi?

342

FITZGIBBON: What about him?
O'MALLEY: This afternoon...

343
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,635
Tony belongs to
a fine upstanding Catholic family.

344
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,910
Eleven children. Sure, I know Tony.
As fine a lad as there is in the parish.

345
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,319
Police don't think so.

- No.

If something isn't done

they're gonna wind up in a reform school.

- Who told you that?
- The police.

350

You've been listening
to Patrick McCarthy, no doubt.

351

Let me tell you that that man
hasn't been to Mass in the last <i>1</i>0 years.

352
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,789
That may be, but I think
McCarthy's right about those kids.

353
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,792
They're terrorising
the whole neighbourhood.

No use talking like that.

355

To hear the police talk, you'd think
that every lad in the parish was a criminal.

356
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,560
I'll have you know
that the very food there before us...

357
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,997
is brought to us by two of those very lads
the police are so maliciously slandering.

Is that so?

359
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,710
Tony Scaponi was one of them.

So, anyway, she tells us
that she's run away from home...

I must admit that my purpose
in going to see the Bishop...

Well, that was that.

1054
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:43,195
And with practically no more of a build up
than that, he asked me to lunch.

1055
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:46,232
Who knows? It might have worked.
It's been known to.

1056
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:49,551
So after I'd cooled him off, I came back here.

1057

expecting to be thrown out any minute.

to myself, "The landlord. Here it comes."

- And who do you think was there?
- Junior?

- So was I.

Well, up to here, we're all surprised.

1062
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:10,110
Naturally, before throwing me out,
he had to know a little about me.

1063
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:13,795
So in a few well-chosen sentences,
I gave him the details.

1064
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:15,791
Sort of like I told you.

1065
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:18,599
And you found a landlord
with a heart of gold.

1066
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,672
Well, not exactly a heart of gold,
Father, but...

1067
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:25,918
Well, we had the apartment vacant,
and it seemed a shame to throw her out.

- Nothing that I know of, up to here.

As I was saying,
it was a shame to throw her out.

She told me about coming to see you
and that you wanted to help her.

- She's got to practice. She's a singer.
- It was very thoughtful.

01:58:48,120 --> 01:58:50,076
I don't know what I'm going to do
without him.

1647
01:58:50,160 --> 01:58:52,754
Don't know who the Bishop
is going to send in his place...

1648
01:58:52,840 --> 01:58:54,990
- but whoever he is...
- Father.

1649
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:02,869
Congratulations to you, Father.

1650
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:08,349
- The Bishop wouldn't do that to me again.
- Yes, he's done it.

1651
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:12,032
Mr. Haines. Nice of you to give
that mortgage to the church.

1652
01:59:12,120 --> 01:59:13,235
HAINES: Not at all.

1653
01:59:13,320 --> 01:59:15,470
Can't tell you how much we appreciate it.

1654
01:59:22,240 --> 01:59:23,719
As you know...

1655
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:27,512
we're all going to miss Father O'Malley.

1656
01:59:30,120 --> 01:59:31,792
He was a fine man.

1657
01:59:34,080 --> 01:59:37,117
This is Father O'Malley,
the man who sent for you.

1658
01:59:37,200 --> 01:59:38,952
How do you do, Mrs. Fitzgibbon?

1659
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:41,679
I've heard so much about you.
Now it's good to see you.

1660
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:45,878
FITZGIBBON: I think you'll agree that
we're all a little better for having known him.

1661
01:59:45,960 --> 01:59:48,349
He was always thinking of others.

1662
01:59:48,840 --> 01:59:51,593
And that, you know,
can make life very beautiful.

1663
01:59:51,680 --> 01:59:55,468
Believe me, it's what we do for others that...
