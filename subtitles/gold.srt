2
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,807
We'll go in the back.

3
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,601
I don't know, Abbie. Sure you
wanna do this? Getting really nervous.

4
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,888
- I'm sure.
- What if someone finds out?

5
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,089
No one's gonna find out.
Take that stupid hat off.

6
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,084
I don't want him to recognise me.
Know how much trouble we can get in?

7
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,051
Oh, shit, here he comes.

8
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,129
You guys looking for me?

9
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,691
Um...

10
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,881
We heard you had stuff to, uh,
make you faster.

11
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,288
- Who told you that?
- Devon's brother.

12
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,771
Don't say my name.

13
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,043
All right, you've got the money?

14
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,929
Look, I'm gonna go and get the shit.
I need you to wait here.

15
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,321
Not out in the open. Go and hide.

16
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,324
- Where?
- I know. What about over there?

17
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,524
- What, behind it?
- Inside it.

18
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,809
- I'm not getting in a rubbish bin.
- Cameras all over here.

19
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,531
If my boss sees you,
he's gonna get suspicious.

20
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,889
- I don't see any cameras.
- Jesus, just do what he says.

21
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,362
We don't make the rules.
This is his turf.

22
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,204
Come on.

23
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,643
It's not even that bad.

24
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,371
I'm not getting in a rubbish bin.

25
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,522
You know that's how you get diarrhea.

26
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,444
Look, do you want the stuff or not?

27
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,691
- Fine.
- Come on.

28
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,083
Two minutes,
then I'm out of here. Move.

29
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,410
- Give me your jacket.
- What?

30
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,131
Your jacket.
I need to put the stuff into it.

31
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,289
Look, just be careful, all right?

32
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,681
Used to be me dad's.

33
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,365
- Not a sound, all right?
- It's from the '80s.

34
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,091
Yeah, grand. Watch your heads.

35
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,009
I don't think he's ever coming
back. My dad's gonna kill me.

36
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,811
Jesus. Shut up, Devon.
What about my pills?

37
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,883
I knew he was dodgy from the start.

38
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,008
Why'd you get in the bin then?

39
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,604
Jesus. Sorry, isn't it?

40
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,690
I'm here to see Eddie Canellin.

41
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,207
- Are you a family member?
- Yeah.

42
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,729
Yeah, I'm his son.

43
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,281
Oh, I didn't know Eddie had a son.

44
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,882
Haven't been around lately.

45
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,481
OK, it's Room 23.

46
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,962
Come on, Abbie, get a move on.

47
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,650
- Been doing foot stretches?
- Yeah.

48
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,485
- Every day?
- Yeah, most days.

49
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,803
- I think that guy is following us.
- Who?

50
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,089
The guy behind us.
He was outside the house.

51
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,164
- Sure it's the same guy?
- Unless there's someone else

52
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,370
driving around with a sofa strapped
to the roof, then, yeah, I'm pretty sure.

53
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,765
Wait here. I'll be right back.

54
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,491
Can I help you?

55
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,885
I'm sorry.

56
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,929
I just sort of...

57
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,484
I didn't wanna call to the house.

58
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,691
Do I know you?

59
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,931
Yeah. Mr McGunn, it's me.

60
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,482
- Ray?
- Long time no see.

61
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,321
I'm not sure it's a good idea,
turning up out of the blue like this.

62
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,801
Alice said the door was always open.

63
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,204
- I'm pretty sure she never said that.
- She did.

64
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,366
She, uh, wrote this letter,

65
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,606
saying to stop by whenever I wanted.

66
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,041
This was written 12 years ago.

67
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,889
Yeah, I appreciate it's a long time,
Mr McGunn.

68
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,646
But she does specifically say

69
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,689
to drop by...

70
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,689
whenever I wanted.

71
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,446
- You invited him to the house?
- I didn't invite him, he followed us.

72
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,171
Anyway, I'm not the one
who wrote him the letter.

73
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,722
- That was years ago.
- You don't put stuff like that in writing.

74
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,963
- What am I supposed to say to him?
- Don't say anything.

75
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,851
- You did nothing wrong.
- He tried to kill himself.

76
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,651
- He was just looking for attention.
- Who tried?

77
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,370
- Your father.
- Jesus.

78
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,488
She's got a right to know.

79
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,086
You never told me
he tried to kill himself.

80
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,288
We didn't think it was a good idea

81
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,762
for you to know
how self-destructive he was.

82
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,090
Why would he do that?

83
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,846
Because he's a very confused
and strange man

84
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,446
who needed to stop feeling sorry
for himself.

85
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,170
Mrs McGunn?

86
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,403
There's a lady asking
about the nest of trestle tables.

87
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,201
Yeah. I'll be right over.

88
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,049
I have to get back to work.

89
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,403
Jesus, I can't believe you did this.

90
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,642
I'm not the one
who wrote the letter.

91
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,730
It's OK.

92
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,491
- Ray.
- Alice.

93
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,361
It's great to see you.

94
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,651
Come in.

95
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,042
God, I couldn't believe it
when Frank told me.

96
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,171
- So, what are you doing back in town?
- Uh...

97
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,289
I don't know. I was just in the area.
You know?

98
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,083
Thought I'd stop by, you know,
pay my respects.

99
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,805
Abbie...

100
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,248
um, this is Ray.

101
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,131
Hi.

102
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,491
Hi.

103
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,925
Um...

104
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,241
- Do you want a drink or something?
- Uh, yeah.

105
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,731
Yeah? Yeah.

106
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,962
Look who's here, Frank.

107
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,604
- So you're into running, is that right?
- Yeah.

108
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,649
She takes it very seriously, Ray.

109
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,010
A lot of competition, but Abbie's
never been afraid to shoot for the gold.

110
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,721
What about yourself, Mr McGunn?

111
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,283
- Still teaching PE down at the school?
- Yes, I am, among other things.

112
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,125
He coaches Abbie's running team too.

113
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,203
All right, that's great.

114
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,843
Ray, sit down.

115
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,691
And you don't need
to call him "Mr McGunn."

116
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,243
Because he's not
your teacher anymore.

117
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,491
So how are you?
Like, what have you been doing

118
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,007
these last, jeez, what is it,
like 12 years?

119
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,721
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good. Good.
Yeah. Yeah.

120
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,201
Just getting on with things. Yeah.

121
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,203
Trying to get things back on track.

122
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,408
"Trying to get things back on track."

123
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,125
It's not really a job, though.

124
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,170
No, no, no.
Not technically, I suppose.

125
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,969
Well, when I got out of the hospital,
I got some odd jobs,

126
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,761
but then I got pretty run down,
so I ended up back in hospital.

127
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,251
- Again?
- Yeah.

128
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,687
So wait, is this before or after you...?

129
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,731
You know, you...

130
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,401
- "tried to hurt yourself?"
- Jesus, Frank.

131
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,050
- No, Ray...
- It's all right.

132
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,248
It's all part of the healing process.

133
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,643
I had to go through this self-help stuff
back at the hospital

134
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,768
where they teach you to, you know,

135
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,606
try and use the negative parts
of yourself to build a platform

136
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,171
for your confidence.

137
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,720
- So you've been building a platform?
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

138
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,605
For my confidence.

139
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,683
That sounds like time well spent.

140
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,808
I don't want him filling Abbie's head
with all that nonsense.

141
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,566
He's got emotional problems.
I feel sorry for him.

142
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,848
He's a fucking space cadet.

143
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,243
I don't trust him. Why's he showing up
after all this time, huh?

144
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,051
Maybe he wants money.
He's not having a penny.

145
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,965
I'm serious, no handouts.
Look at him, for chrissake.

146
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,282
When did the smelly fuck
last have a bath?

147
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,204
- He can hear us.
- I don't care.

148
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,691
Stop.

149
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,602
This is getting uncomfortable.

150
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,649
- I'm gonna wait in my room.
- No.

151
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,211
Sorry.

152
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,041
I should get going anyway.

153
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,370
Do you want a hug or something?

154
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,810
Never mind.

155
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,322
I'm just gonna go.

156
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,088
He's still out there.

157
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,411
- What?
- Still out there.

158
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,451
- I think he's sleeping in his car.
- No, he's not. Go back to bed.

159
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,891
- What's he doing?
- He's so gross.

160
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,287
Why sleep out there
where we can see him?

161
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,522
Maybe he'll be gone in the morning.

162
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,330
Jesus, Frank, he's not a dog.

163
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,643
I don't care.
He's not luring his way back in here.

164
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,167
No, we can't leave him out there.

165
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,965
These Frank's?

166
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,964
Yeah. Is that all right?

167
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,361
I mean, they're clean and everything.

168
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,808
Yeah, great. Nice and big.

169
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,011
What's this about, Ray?
What are you doing here?

170
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,004
I don't know.
I'm just paying my respects.

171
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,609
Yeah? Well, whatever it is,
I don't want Abbie getting hurt.

172
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,564
It's my dad.

173
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,809
I think he's dying.

174
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,521
Just wanted to see me, you know?

175
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,730
Before anything happened.

176
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,929
I'm sorry.

177
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,650
Good night.

178
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,210
Thanks.

179
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,128
Oh, hey. Bet you thought
I didn't see you there.

180
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,602
I'm high-performance coach
Frank McGunn.

181
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,207
Do you want to be a winner?
Do you dream of being a champion

182
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,727
and one day owning medals
and trophies?

183
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,528
Medals. Trophies.

184
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,809
Then I'm here to help.

185
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,123
The human foot,
a masterpiece of engineering

186
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,524
that top scientists are only now
beginning to unravel the mystery of.

187
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,048
But what if I told you
there was a new way to use your foot?

188
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,966
An amazing technique that could
revolutionize running as we know it

189
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:20,045
and set you on the path
to becoming a true champion.

190
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,131
So come with me and remember,

191
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,525
the journey of a thousand miles
starts with a single step.

192
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,490
What's it like having a dad
who tried to kill himself?

193
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,529
I already told you,
he's not my dad.

194
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,251
He's a homeless guy
sleeping in the trophy room.

195
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,483
- I hope it's not hereditary.
- Jesus, shut up, Devon.

196
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,450
I mean, what if you have
some sort of gene in your DNA

197
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,888
that turned you
into suicidal depressant?

198
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,771
What are you doing here?

199
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,924
Your mum had to work late
so she asked me to pick you up.

200
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,766
- Why would she do that?
- I don't know. She just did.

201
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,810
Come on, let's go.

202
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,089
I don't know.
Why's he got a sofa on his roof?

203
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,642
I already told you. He's homeless.

204
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,840
- Yeah, well, I don't like him.
- Ugh.

205
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,240
So, what, you do this
running thing every day?

206
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,405
True champions achieve the impossible
by rising above physical pain.

207
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,530
Sounds like something
Frank the Wank would say.

208
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,448
You call my dad "Frank the Wank"?

209
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,803
Yeah, well, most people did
when we were younger.

210
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,327
- That was his name.
- Isn't that our turn?

211
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,044
- This is the wrong way.
- I wanna show you something.

212
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,806
- You're supposed to take us home.
- Yeah, yeah.

213
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,485
Turn around. Right now.

214
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,201
OK, fine. It was supposed
to be a big surprise

215
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,081
and I didn't wanna tell you,
but, well, you forced me, OK?

216
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,686
You've ruined my surprise.

217
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,121
We're gonna go
and see your grandfather.

218
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,523
- Who?
- Your grandfather, we'll go see him.

219
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,523
Are you fucking retarded?

220
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,480
He's been very sick.
It would mean a lot to him.

221
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,291
- This is bullshit.
- Come on, what's the big deal?

222
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,603
I'm not going to see some old, sick guy
I've never heard of.

223
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,888
If Abbie's not going, I'm not going.

224
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,247
Now turn this car around,
I wanna go home.

225
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,605
This place has really changed.
Used to be packed in here all the time.

226
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,240
I swear to God, it was out the door.

227
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,806
I know you. You used to live across
from the Rainbow, right?

228
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,247
Yeah, I used to drink in here.

229
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,721
Raymond? That's it, isn't it?

230
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,201
You used to come down here
with Alice Clancy.

231
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,886
- Yeah.
- Oh, man.

232
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,886
I heard some fucked up things
happened to you.

233
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,804
I don't mean that in a bad way.

234
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,123
- It's all right. It was a longtime ago.
- Sure was.

235
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,568
Still can't believe she ended up
with your old PE teacher.

236
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,011
<i>HEY-</i>

237
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,324
Hey, mister.

238
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,408
- Do I know you from somewhere?
- Don't think so.

239
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,204
Oh. You certainly look familiar.

240
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,526
You don't work at the Seafood Express,
do you?

241
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,810
No. Don't know that place.

242
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,123
I think I might have seen you

243
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,011
down at the nursing home
where my father lives.

244
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,205
Oh, that's right,
your Eddie Canellin's son.

245
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,328
Well, I knew you looked familiar.

246
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,689
So you live near here or something?

247
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,171
Kind of.

248
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,245
I used to live around here,
but been away.

249
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,609
Oh, wow. Where were you?
Off traveling somewhere?

250
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,011
I was in the hospital.

251
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,763
Oh, I'm sorry.

252
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,491
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

253
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,531
This is funny. Me thinking
I know you from somewhere

254
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,251
- and then us ending up talking.
- I suppose.

255
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,768
- I'm Rosie, by the way.
- Ray.

256
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,882
I like to come here after work
and just hang out, you know?

257
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,371
See if anybody comes in.

258
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,371
Yeah.

259
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,361
Jesus, who the hell is that?

260
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,971
- Mr McGunn.
- Ray.

261
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,723
Do you know what time it is?

262
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,326
No. Why?

263
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,448
What the hell do you want?

264
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,729
Oh, listen,
I'm sorry for disturbing you.

265
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,644
I just wanted to say thank you.

266
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,211
For what?

267
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,204
For taking me in and everything.
It means a lot to me.

268
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,604
And I don't want you feeling bad
about what happened to me.

269
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,810
I know some people think you drove me
to it, but it's not what I think.

270
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,122
I don't want you thinking
that way either.

271
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,170
Jesus, could this not have waited
until the morning?

272
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,891
Yeah.

273
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,331
Yeah.

274
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,721
It's been hard, you know.

275
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,724
Past few years, no one to talk to.

276
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,569
Oh, fuck it.

277
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,081
You know how it is. Hm?

278
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,085
Go to bed.

279
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,605
OK.

280
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,968
What's the matter?
Everything all right?

281
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,282
It's nothing. I'm fine.

282
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,765
Ray said when he was younger,

283
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,844
Mum and him used to call you
Frank the Wank.

284
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,605
What?

285
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,765
He said it was your name.

286
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,844
- That's what people called you.
- And you believed him?

287
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,367
You think I'd let them call me that?

288
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,520
No way, Jose. When I was younger,
I was one of the coolest teachers.

289
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,526
- Ask anyone.
- Is all this really necessary?

290
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,765
I mean, dragging us all out
to the middle of nowhere.

291
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,163
Yes, Abbie needs every bit
of extra training she can get.

292
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,122
Mind if we listened to something else?

293
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,682
Yes, I would mind. I'm listening to it.

294
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,842
Stop it, Frank.

295
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,284
So, what, you're gonna go
running up here?

296
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,967
It's high-altitude endurance training.
Next step in my programme.

297
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,890
Oh, yeah, I saw those workout videos
in my room.

298
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,567
They're not workout videos.
A revolutionary new running technique.

299
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,170
You see, most athletes run upright
and strike the ground heel first.

300
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,563
The Way of The McGunn teaches
shifting your centre of gravity,

301
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:35,406
leaning forward, using the middle
of your foot to conserve energy.

302
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,282
Conserve energy. Wow.

303
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,851
- Oh, yeah.
- Fuck off.

304
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,606
That's amazing, Mr McGunn.

305
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,048
- This'll help change millions of lives.
- Supposedly.

306
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,770
What you mean "supposedly"?

307
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,049
Once this thing takes off,
it's gonna blow people away.

308
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,731
Ah.

309
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,601
OK, everybody,
I want you to listen up.

310
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,048
It's a whole different world up here.

311
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,044
One wrong move,
they airlift you out in a body bag.

312
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,481
I think we can manage, Frank.

313
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,649
Can I have a word with you, please?

314
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,487
- Can you get that?
- I have it.

315
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,485
- Why were you saying shit about me?
- What do you mean?

316
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,929
You know, all that stuff about my name,
what people used to call me.

317
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,321
Jesus, Frank, I was just saying.

318
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,484
I didn't mean anything by it.

319
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,564
- Come on!
- Frank. Frank, I'm sorry.

320
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,880
It's 11.45,
at an altitude of almost 1,800 feet.

321
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,442
Abbie should be making her way
down along the river. We should...

322
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,924
Thanks, Ray. That's great.
You've ruined the whole shot.

323
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,525
Sorry.

324
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,970
Where the hell is she?

325
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:42,045
Maybe she got tired and went back.
I mean, it's freezing out.

326
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,487
She's up there in a tiny pair of shorts.

327
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,450
The size of her shorts has nothing
to do with it.

328
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,402
Ooh.

329
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,610
Jesus Christ, Abbie. Come on.

330
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,762
- Frank, it's not that big a deal.
- What?

331
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:06,210
You're kind of pushing her very hard
to succeed at something that's...

332
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,486
In fairness, it's completely pointless.

333
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:14,009
"Pointless"? You're fucking pointless.
I mean, what are you even doing here?

334
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,003
Come on, man. Relax, will you?

335
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,687
You know what? I've about had it
with you manipulating everyone.

336
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,320
"Oh, poor Ray, he's so fragile."

337
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,529
- Pack up your shit and get out of here.
- Alice said...

338
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,490
I don't care what Alice said!
Out of my house!

339
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,962
Fuck you, Frank. It's my family
you're living with, remember?

340
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:36,091
Be grateful. If they stayed with you,
they'd be living on the street.

341
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,605
That's not true.

342
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,806
Sorry, I forgot.
They'd be living in your car.

343
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,081
So, what are you gonna do, huh?

344
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,208
You've got nowhere live. No job.

345
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,203
- No friends.
- Leave it now, Frank.

346
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,250
Abbie is scared she's gonna turn
into a wreck like you.

347
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,129
- Fuck off!
- Whoa!

348
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,540
Frank!

349
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,562
I didn't“ I didn't mean it!

350
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,651
Frank!

351
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,291
Frank.

352
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,205
Help!

353
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,682
Help!

354
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,890
Frank!

355
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,169
Frank!

356
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,765
Frank!

357
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,891
Dad?

358
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,611
- Get your ma.
- OK. OK.

359
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,604
Thanks.

360
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,610
Are you OK?

361
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,762
I just can't believe this is happening.

362
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,207
Don't worry, he's gonna wake up.

363
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,802
Everything's gonna be fine.

364
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,164
Oh, hi. Bet you thought
I didn't see you there.

365
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,687
I'm high-performance coach
Frank McGunn.

366
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,320
I'm browsing some of the old medals
and trophies

367
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,041
in my custom-made trophy cabinet.
Now, I know what you're thinking.

368
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,568
"Hey, Frank, how come
all these medals here are gold?

369
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,122
What about all the silver and bronze
you must've picked up?"

370
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,965
Well, the truth is, there aren't any.

371
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,168
You see, with The Way of The McGunn,

372
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,891
we don't believe in second place.

373
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:21,320
So before we continue,
I have to ask you a question.

374
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,369
Do you have what it takes to take your
place in the pantheon of champions?

375
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,085
Oh, I don't know, Abbie.
I'm not sure about this.

376
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,608
What's the big deal?
It's not like they're illegal or anything.

377
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:04,481
They're just an energy substitute,
made from natural products.

378
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,642
Natural products?

379
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,644
Well, I'm just not sure you need it,
you know?

380
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,811
If you want me to go up
to the nursing home,

381
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,485
then you have to do this.

382
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,688
- And you'll go see him?
- If you get me the stuff.

383
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,806
All right. But just to get this clear,

384
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,884
- it's just the once, OK?
- Yeah, I know. I know.

385
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,488
I'm looking for some guy, Kenny.

386
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,165
Oh, yeah?

387
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,525
Back there.

388
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,880
- You Kenny?
- That depends.

389
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,724
Who's asking?

390
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,290
I heard you might be able
to fix me up with something,

391
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,922
you know, help me get into shape.

392
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,730
Who told you that?

393
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,282
Just this guy I know.

394
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:27,406
He said you might be able to give me
something to help me run quicker.

395
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,767
- You're looking for some juice?
- Yeah.

396
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,251
All right.

397
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,322
These are all made
from natural products?

398
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,245
Sure. That's why I hide them
in the toilets cistern.

399
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,885
Let me do the talking. Maybe don't talk
to him unless he talks to you first.

400
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,690
- Should I say hello?
- Yeah.

401
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,650
Don't say it
like you don't wanna be there.

402
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,929
Don't act like you hate me either.
Let me look at you.

403
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,889
- Whoa. What are you doing?
- Nothing.

404
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,724
Don't touch me.

405
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,045
Sorry.

406
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,561
Rosie, have you moved me dad
to another room?

407
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,722
Oh, Ray, I'm so sorry.

408
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,371
I'm afraid Eddie passed away
in the night.

409
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,851
It was really sudden.
The doctor did everything he could.

410
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,323
I'm so sorry.

411
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,765
Yeah.

412
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,610
You're leaving.

413
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,489
Yeah.

414
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,690
It's probably for the best,
just getting in the way around here.

415
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,367
I've got some paperwork
and the funeral and everything, but...

416
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,401
"after that, I'll be on me way."

417
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,164
Where are you gonna go?

418
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,850
I don't know.

419
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,569
Hadn't thought that far ahead.

420
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,084
Because I was thinking,

421
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:18,724
you know, if you wanted,
you could stay around here for a while.

422
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,242
- Really?
- Yeah.

423
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,444
I mean, if you wanted to.

424
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,489
Well...

425
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,042
Yeah, I mean, great. If you're sure.

426
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,964
Just have to talk your mum and stuff.

427
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,923
- Whatever, you know.
- Yeah.

428
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,445
It's just a suggestion.

429
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,082
I'm sorry about your dad.

430
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,365
Thanks.

431
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,528
What are we doing here? It's freezing.

432
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,569
Come on. Trust me.

433
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,090
What do you think?

434
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,641
Bet you didn't even know
this place existed.

435
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,880
It may not look like much,
but back in the day,

436
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,486
this is where it all happened.

437
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,490
First time I ever saw your mum,
she was sitting there.

438
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,971
Yeah?

439
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,602
She asked me for a cigarette
and just started talking.

440
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,568
Can I ask you something?

441
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,131
Yeah.

442
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,091
Think when I'm older
I might try to kill myself?

443
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,605
No.

444
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,842
Why would you ask something
like that?

445
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,881
Devon told me it might be genetic.

446
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,089
And because you tried to do it,
I might try to do it.

447
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,608
It's not genetic.
That's not how it works.

448
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,250
So why did you do it?

449
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,566
I don't know. It's hard to explain.

450
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,249
I suppose...

451
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:10,651
your mum didn't want me around
after you were born, and...

452
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,926
I didn't know how to handle it.

453
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,731
Can't explain it any better than that.

454
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,482
Why didn't she want you around?

455
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,970
I don't know.
She was just worried, you know?

456
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:33,769
I didn't have a job.
We didn't have anywhere proper to live.

457
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:39,485
And one day she just said she was
taking you and moving in with Frank.

458
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,205
Then what?

459
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,562
You decided to, you know...

460
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,567
- ..kill yourself.
- I didn't decide that.

461
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,882
It just kind of happened.

462
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,249
Anyway, you shouldn't be worried
about this stuff, you know?

463
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,883
You should be concentrating
on having fun,

464
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,929
getting into trouble.

465
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,482
That's not what Frank says.

466
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,051
No?

467
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,125
He says to be a champion like him,
I've gotta be 100 per cent committed.

468
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,409
I've got to sacrifice everything,
no matter what it takes.

469
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,722
And that's what you want, is it?

470
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,408
To be like that?

471
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,051
I don't know.

472
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,330
Maybe.

473
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,844
On, hi.

474
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,801
I bet you thought
I didn't see you there.

475
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:21,123
I'm high-performance coach
Gerry Pfeffer.

476
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,683
Me too.

477
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,930
Oh, hey.

478
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,208
I bet you thought
I didn't see you there.

479
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,647
I'm high-performance coach Gerry...

480
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,167
Oh, sorry, I was just...

481
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,527
- Gerry?
- Yes. Yes.

482
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,683
I don't know, Ray.
We got a lot of big races coming up.

483
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,127
Exactly. I can help.

484
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,170
Assistant coaching's
a serious business.

485
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:57,489
You got no experience,
no references.

486
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,967
According to Frank, you spent time
in some sort of home for the...

487
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,291
- ..mentally ill. Is that right?
- Hm.

488
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,449
Oh, for Christ“ No.

489
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:12,082
Keep it going. Keep it...
Keep it go... No, don't.

490
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,608
All right, just for a couple minutes
and get your breath back.

491
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,331
Just give us a chance, Gerry.
I can do this.

492
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,081
OK, look, ordinarily,
I'd tell you where to go,

493
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,847
but, uh, Frank's always been
a personal hero of mine,

494
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,085
and what you did up there in that river,
jumping in the water like that,

495
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,163
that took real courage.

496
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,765
God knows we could use
some of that around here.

497
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,650
Come on, girls, come on.
Push on through! Come on.

498
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,131
Yeah.

499
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,165
Do I get a whistle?

500
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,247
Uh, no.

501
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,928
What about a clip chart?

502
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,844
You can hold this one.

503
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,168
- Come on, Abbie!
- Go.

504
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,289
- Come on!
- Go.

505
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,804
- Come on!
- You can do it.

506
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,962
- Yeah!
- To the finish line.

507
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,048
Ray, did you see that?

508
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,885
- Amazing.
- Well done, Abbie.

509
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,169
What the hell, Abbie?
Where did that come from?

510
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,766
Frank's programme.
I've been watching the DVDs.

511
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,251
- Yeah?
- Yeah, every day.

512
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,609
Hear that? Frank's on his deathbed,
coming up with the goods.

513
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,491
Jesus, Gerry.
Frank's not on his deathbed.

514
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,291
What? No, no, no. He's...
You know what I mean.

515
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,331
He's fine. He's not dying.
He's a million per cent alive.

516
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,811
Easy.

517
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,123
- Hey. Cracking run. Cracking run.
- I won!

518
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,203
Get warmed up. Don't get cold.

519
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,964
- Well, done, girls.
- I won!

520
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,407
- Nice run. Get those tops on.
- You won.

521
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,925
- Great work.
- Thank you.

522
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:04,445
Do I believe this programme has the
power to change the lives of millions?

523
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,568
Yes, absolutely, I do.

524
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,690
It's about having the courage
to take that next step,

525
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,808
to go that extra mile.

526
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:14,201
My whole life has led to this point.

527
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,362
This is why I'm here.

528
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,009
To change the world.

529
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:26,084
You gotta take your time.
Don't shoot too quick.

530
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,210
- Just hit the ball.
- Remember, it's all about geometry.

531
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,805
Whoo-hoo.

532
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,882
Self-taught. Excuse me.
No lessons.

533
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,010
I was one of the best players around.
Remember, I had me own cue

534
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,323
- that screwed back and everything.
- You probably stole it from this place.

535
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,811
Shh.

536
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,411
- Jesus, Alice.
- Two shots.

537
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:53,007
Hey. Raymo and Alice, huh?
Just like old times.

538
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,447
- Thanks a million.
- Cheers to you.

539
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,249
- It's my go?
- Yeah.

540
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,689
- Move out the way.
- No more of your antics.

541
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,721
- This one's on the house.
- Grand, Tommy.

542
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,888
Yay!

543
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,251
There you go.

544
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,482
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

545
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,170
Whoa.

546
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,047
Oh, my, I love this song.

547
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,929
- Do you remember this song?
- Mm-hm.

548
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,730
- Dance with me?
- I will not.

549
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,609
- Please.
- I'm not a dancer.

550
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,491
- You're so boring.
- Alice. Well, you're pissed.

551
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:45,001
<i>♪ I want to see the bright lights tonight</i>

552
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:52,126
♪ Meet me
at the station don't be late

553
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:57,922
<i>♪ I need to spend some money
and it just won't wait</i>

554
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:04,524
<i>♪ Take me to the dance
and hold me tight</i>

555
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:11,048
<i>♪ I want to see
the bright lights tonight ♪</i>

556
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:16,569
Do you ever think
about the stuff Tommy was saying?

557
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,090
Like what?

558
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:23,321
You know, the past and everything.

559
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,244
Like when we were younger.

560
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,050
I don't know.

561
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,161
Sometimes, I suppose.

562
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:35,205
I've been thinking about it a lot lately.

563
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,768
About what happened.

564
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,923
Jesus.

565
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:47,608
I never wanted it to end up
the way it did.

566
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:52,129
No, I was young and scared and...

567
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,691
Ugh.

568
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,568
I thought all this was what I needed.

569
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,529
Hey, Alice.

570
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,571
You got nothing
to feel bad about, OK?

571
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:04,485
You got this whole new life going on.

572
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,570
It's great.

573
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:09,242
I'm happy for you.

574
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,371
Yeah.

575
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,971
I'm glad you came back.

576
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,050
I mean it.

577
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,645
Abbie!

578
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,043
Abbie!

579
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:23,249
Yeah, well, if it's so good,
how come nobody's ever heard of it?

580
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,448
It happened.
Just a question of time.

581
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:28,922
I'll show you if you want.
My dad's got tons of DVDs.

582
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,731
Mum?

583
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,085
Mum! 'Oh-my God!

584
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,763
What the hell are you doing?!

585
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,209
Is that guy fucking your mum?

586
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,089
On, God!

587
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,524
Fuck off!

588
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,928
- What are you doing?
- Packing my stuff.

589
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,162
No, no, hang on.
Where are you gonna go?

590
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,641
I don't care,
as long as it's away from here.

591
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,849
We need to talk about this, Abbie.
You can't just leave.

592
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:33,530
Please, I'm so sorry. Please.

593
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,160
- I know you're upset.
- Don't even talk to me.

594
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,402
- Stay out of it.
- Just trying to help.

595
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:42,121
Just get the phone. Look, I know
you're confused about what you saw.

596
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,611
- Not confused.
- Hello.

597
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,125
I know exactly what I saw.

598
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,011
- I'm gonna stay at Devon's.
- Just let me explain.

599
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,766
It's the hospital. It's about Frank.

600
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,449
He woke up.

601
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,721
- How is he?
- He's stable.

602
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,690
He's suffering a form
of posttraumatic stress.

603
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,763
It's normal in situations like this.

604
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,651
Has he said anything,
mentioned the accident at all?

605
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,087
He's still experiencing
some disorientation,

606
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,891
his memory may take some time
before it returns.

607
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:21,408
- So nothing about the accident?
- No.

608
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,282
- Hey. Hello.
- I'm so glad you're OK.

609
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,647
- Be careful, sweetie.
- I was so sad.

610
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,848
Hi. Hi.

611
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:34,609
- How are you feeling?
- All right.

612
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,888
- You need a blanket?
- Oh, no, darling.

613
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,530
Oh, hi, Ray.

614
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,011
Hello.

615
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,961
- Sweetie?
- Yeah?

616
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,168
Oh, he stopped again.

617
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,884
Hey.

618
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,088
Are you OK?

619
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,927
I've been over that terrain
a hundred times, and nothing.

620
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:14,324
Not so much as a scratch. How could I
have been so stupid as to fall in?

621
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,131
It was an accident.

622
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,522
Why don't you come outside, huh?

623
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,603
Get some fresh air.

624
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,489
I don't know.

625
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,969
What if they don't respect me?

626
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,088
Nobody's gonna judge you.

627
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:31,050
Everyone's just glad you're home.

628
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,800
. Hey, Ray.
- Hey.

629
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:07,166
I tried calling at the front,
but no one answered.

630
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:11,370
Yeah, we're having
a little get-together. Frank.

631
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,446
On, OK. Yeah.

632
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,210
So we had some of Eddie's things
up at the home.

633
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,249
I thought I'd bring them around
for you.

634
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,731
On.

635
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:27,241
That's his watch, his wallet,
stuff like that.

636
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,971
Great. Thanks.

637
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,929
Still can't believe he did that.

638
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,970
From what I saw,
Mrs McGunn was really getting into it.

639
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,011
Shut the fuck up, Stuart.

640
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:41,163
- Pretty cool seeing her vagina, though.
- I said, shut up.

641
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,163
God!

642
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,368
I saw my parents doing it once.

643
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,490
Taped themselves on one
of my brother's wrestling videos.

644
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,881
- Could you see everything?
- Yeah.

645
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,849
Cool.

646
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:58,365
I suppose I've always been overweight,
but when I got married, I laid it on.

647
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:01,330
I gained 65 pounds,
can you imagine that?

648
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:06,202
Terry, that was my husband,
he got really angry.

649
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,931
And pretty soon
we stopped sleeping together.

650
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:12,129
- I just kept getting bigger and bigger.
- Yeah?

651
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:15,329
I think that was the worst part,
like, I felt so ashamed.

652
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,802
But instead of trying to give up,
I just kept at it.

653
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:23,204
I'd sneak out and hit Burger King
or Abrakebabra or Mr Chicken.

654
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:26,648
Sometimes all three. I didn't
wanna order too much from one.

655
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:30,282
Yeah? Jeez, that's great.
Would you mind that a second?

656
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,370
Alice.

657
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,800
- Can I speak to you for a second?
- Now's not a great time.

658
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,769
You're not angry with me, are you?

659
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,571
Oh, Jesus, Ray.
I said I can't talk right now.

660
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,769
Let's just talk,
after everything that's happened.

661
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,763
Ray, nothing happened.

662
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,606
I was just upset and confused.

663
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,207
What do you mean?
How can you say nothing happened?

664
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,564
You wanna carry on living a lie?

665
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,451
Jesus, Ray. This isn't a game.

666
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,524
- This is my family.
- It's my family too.

667
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:10,921
No, it's not.

668
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,411
Don't be an idiot.

669
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,047
What did you think
was going to happen?

670
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,567
Did you think I was going
to go pack my bags

671
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,085
and run away together?

672
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,850
Come on.

673
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,884
Hey! There he is.

674
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:30,850
We were wondering when
you were gonna show your face, eh?

675
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,490
Death came knocking,

676
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:36,440
but big Frankie McGunn
did not answer the door.

677
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,409
Good to see you, Frank.

678
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,287
If I could just get your attention.

679
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,407
Frank's asked to say a few words.

680
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,881
You go for it, Frank.
You're amongst friends.

681
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:57,485
Ahem. First, I'd like
to thank you all for being here

682
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:01,486
and for your support
at this difficult time.

683
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:04,166
Our friends, our family.

684
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,641
It's great to see the kids here.

685
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,370
It really means a lot.

686
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:13,128
But mostly I'd like to thank God

687
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,045
for granting me
this second chance at life...

688
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,611
and for allowing me
to remain among the living

689
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,321
and showing me that my work
on earth is not yet finished.

690
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,805
Amen.

691
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,530
<i>HEY-</i>

692
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,883
I know Alice said that we weren't
supposed to do anything

693
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:46,566
to get you excited.

694
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,324
But I've got some news.

695
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,171
Really big news.

696
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:53,610
I got a call from one
of the board members at the club.

697
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:57,082
They're all really excited
about this new programme of yours.

698
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,810
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

699
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,769
They said if The Way of The McGunn

700
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,890
can generate the kind of results
they've seen with Abbie,

701
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:09,080
you could be sitting
on a big pot of digital gold.

702
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:12,050
- He said that?
- "Digital gold," Frank.

703
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,043
Those were his exact words.

704
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,531
- Jesus.
- I know.

705
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,808
He said, as soon as you feel up to it,

706
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:21,169
he wants you to go down there,
show him what it's all about.

707
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:31,163
It's so bad if people said it
to your face.

708
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,685
Abbie, can I speak to you
for a second?

709
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,490
Get lost.

710
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,850
Come on, guys, we're going.

711
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,650
I'm sorry about what happened.

712
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,849
The last thing in the world I wanted
was to hurt you.

713
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,131
That's such bullshit.

714
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,851
I can't believe I almost fell for it.

715
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,003
- Abbie...
- You're a fake.

716
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,960
You act like you're this great person,
but you're just a fucking liar!

717
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:05,004
I'm sorry.

718
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:08,323
Well, my dad's back now
so we don't need you around anymore.

719
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:26,407
OK, guys, this is it.

720
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:30,531
We're gonna show everyone we
are not the worst team in the county.

721
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:34,321
- We are the worst team in the county.
- We're here because of Abbie.

722
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:38,121
All right, that might be true,
but that's no reason not to try, OK?

723
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:39,930
Remember what Coach Frank said.

724
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:43,402
You put your heart on that track
and you're halfway to winning.

725
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,203
- Even if we come last?
- Yeah.

726
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:49,523
How can coming last be halfway
to winning?

727
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:53,480
Because it... I don't know, OK?
Because it just... It just can.

728
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:56,610
Now, just try your best. Yeah?

729
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,524
- Come on, let's rock.
- Let's go.

730
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,444
Abbie, Abbie.

731
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,365
Good luck out there, yeah?

732
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,290
Come on, Abbie.

733
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:26,603
- Come on, Abbie!
- Here we go.

734
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:36,566
Regional record, regional record.
She's broken the regional record.

735
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:39,766
- She's broken the regional record.
- What?

736
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:52,131
All the greats have had
their names up there.

737
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,849
Nikki Fitzgibbon.

738
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,445
Tommy Thompson.

739
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:00,523
Frankie Kennedy back in '96.

740
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:02,808
Yeah, all the greats, and now you.

741
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:07,089
I'll have your name up there
by the end of the day. Official.

742
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:11,360
Now, you just got to provide
a small urine sample.

743
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:14,171
- A what?
- Yeah, it's just a formality.

744
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:17,210
You know, make sure
everything's above board.

745
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,281
You never said anything
about a urine sample.

746
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,681
No, I know, but it's, uh...

747
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,808
It's not that big a deal.

748
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:27,803
You know where it is, it's just...

749
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:44,125
I can't do it.

750
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,490
Everything OK?

751
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:56,765
I can't do the test.

752
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,650
Why not?

753
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:08,811
Why the hell not, Abbie?

754
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:17,120
Oh, Jesus Christ.

755
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,891
Hello?

756
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,323
Oh, he's in physio.

757
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:54,411
OK.

758
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:01,521
That was Gerry on the phone.

759
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,569
Oh, yeah? What did he say?

760
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,487
He said he wants you to go down
to the club.

761
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,005
He said it's important.

762
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:14,283
Jesus, Alice. This is it.

763
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,405
This is really it.

764
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:18,369
Get this thing off me.

765
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:22,482
- No, I think we'll finish up here first.
- No.

766
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,005
It's my presentation.

767
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:28,085
Hill, Gerry, the board,
they'll all be there.

768
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:35,730
Fred, get me out.

769
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:45,650
Get Ray on the phone. It's show time.

770
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:56,528
I'm dead. I'm so fucking dead.

771
01:03:56,680 --> 01:04:00,048
- Think they'll kick me off the team?
- I don't know, maybe.

772
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:03,124
Taking drugs, that's one
of the worst things you can do.

773
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:07,080
This is really bad.
I'm too young to go to jail, right?

774
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:10,801
I don't know, but they can put you
in some teenage detention centre.

775
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,410
- Hi, Frank.
- Hi, Karen.

776
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,050
I have a meeting with Gerry.

777
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:19,170
OK, you head right in.
They'll be with you shortly.

778
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:45,570
I know he's a friend of yours, Gerry,
but we need to stick together on this.

779
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,569
Now.

780
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:15,885
Oh, hi. Bet you thought
I didn't see you there.

781
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:19,047
I'm high-performance coach
Frank McGunn.

782
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:23,250
And welcome
to the future of athletics.

783
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,486
What's he doing?
Why has he turned off the lights?

784
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,765
We all have dreams. I know I do.

785
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:39,850
Ever since I was a child, I remember
dreaming of doing something great.

786
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:43,205
Achieving something
that no one else could achieve.

787
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:47,251
- Get that idiot down from there.
- He's in a fucking wheelchair.

788
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:50,604
All my life I'd asked myself
the same question.

789
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:54,091
What makes an athlete great?

790
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:56,205
Was it speed?

791
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,410
Was it power?

792
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,769
Or was it endurance?

793
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:08,646
And then it came to me
in a moment of innate wisdom.

794
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:11,766
<i>Moments of innate wisdom.</i>

795
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:16,805
Now, I could sit here and tell you
about how good the programme is

796
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:21,409
and how it'll change the lives
of millions of people,

797
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,927
but that's not
the Frank McGunn way.

798
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:32,400
The journey of a thousand miles
starts with a single step.

799
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:37,087
- Jesus, Frank.
- I've had enough of this.

800
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,971
Turn on the lights, turn off the music.
Turn it off.

801
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:43,567
Jesus, Frank, what is all this?
What are you doing?

802
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:45,165
I'm making me pitch.

803
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:48,642
- You think that's why you're here?
- Of course, what else?

804
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:51,930
Will someone please explain to me
what's going on?

805
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:54,162
Gerry asked me
to make a presentation,

806
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:55,970
something to get you excited.

807
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:59,806
This is the club lawyer, Frank,
we thought he should be here for this.

808
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:02,247
- What's going on?
- Look, there's no...

809
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,085
There's no easy way to do this,
so I'm just...

810
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:07,129
I'm gonna come out and say it.

811
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:10,366
Abbie's been using
a contraband substance.

812
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:13,722
- What?
- You're joking, right?

813
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:16,201
- Not possible.
- There must be some mistake.

814
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:20,081
It's possible. How else do you explain
her miraculous improvement?

815
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:21,605
She's using the programme.

816
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,127
It had nothing to do
with your programme.

817
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:26,562
No, no, no, it doesn't make sense.

818
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,611
Abbie would never...

819
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:31,764
I spoke to her this afternoon,
she told me everything.

820
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:35,086
Where would she even get
something like that?

821
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:48,125
Look, I can't do this anymore.

822
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:50,601
It's time you made
some other arrangements.

823
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:52,922
So, what? That's it?

824
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:55,287
"So long, Ray, thanks for everything"?

825
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,042
I didn't thank you for anything.

826
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:02,363
What the fuck would I thank you for?!

827
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:07,361
I can't believe you bought her drugs!

828
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,761
Jesus Christ,
what were you thinking?

829
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:21,369
What would possess you
to do something like that?

830
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:24,091
I asked you a question. Did you hear?

831
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:26,725
Have you been drinking?

832
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:30,051
- Maybe.
- Jesus Christ.

833
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:33,283
Abbie, listen to me, OK?

834
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,164
Are you all right?

835
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:38,531
I think I wet my pants.

836
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:42,806
- Oh, my God.
- Abbie.

837
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,687
- Go on. Go on in.
- Yeah, yeah.

838
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:58,525
Oh, my God.
Hey, can you help us? Please.

839
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:01,049
We need help!

840
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,371
All right.

841
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:17,965
So, uh...

842
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:23,608
Probably just gonna go now. Ahem.

843
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:30,281
Do you think it'd be OK if I, uh...?

844
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:34,600
- It's probably not a good idea.
- I'll be really quick, I promise.

845
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:51,209
Can I come in?

846
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,371
No.

847
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:06,166
So, I'm probably gonna go now.

848
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,842
Got some stuff I need to take care of.

849
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:14,010
Abbie.

850
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:19,881
You know you're the one thing
in me whole life that I'm proud of.

851
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:23,006
Maybe the only thing
I'll look back on...

852
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:26,530
and say, "Hey, you know what?
I didn't mess that up."

853
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:28,648
"She actually turned out
pretty good."

854
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:34,843
And the reason she turned out so good
is because I wasn't around, you know?

855
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:38,288
To get in the way or...

856
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:42,527
That's why me going is...

857
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:46,724
ls probably the best thing
for everyone.

858
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:56,768
I'll see you.

859
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:54,487
<i>You've opened a dialog.
That's a positive move.</i>

860
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:58,486
<i>The first step on the path
to reconciliation.</i>

861
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:03,610
But you've still got a long road
ahead of you.

862
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,884
Well, we're all very committed.

863
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,565
That's good.

864
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:13,089
In order to move forward as a family,
it's important you try to...

865
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:15,481
To create a platform

866
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:19,406
to help rebuild your confidence
in one another.

867
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:21,767
I'm sorry. A platform?

868
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:23,970
Exactly.

869
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:57,608
- How old is it?
- You should see.

870
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:59,683
I think it's sort of abandoned.

871
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:04,004
You should stay here,
do some repairs.

872
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,931
<i>“Things didn't work out
the way I planned, Ray,</i>

873
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:13,764
<i>“but I know you tried your best.</i>

874
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:18,129
<i>"I want to say this now
before ifs too late."</i>

875
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:20,567
<i>"Don't make the same mistakes! Did."</i>

876
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:23,690
<i>"Don't end up all alone
in a place like this."</i>

877
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:27,529
<i>“You lost that little girl once,
and it almost killed you.</i>

878
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:30,049
<i>"Don't let that happen again."</i>

879
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,124
<i>"She needs you, Ray."</i>

880
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:36,530
<i>"She might not know it yet,
but she does."</i>

881
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:38,762
<i>"And you need her too."</i>

882
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:44,408
So, you sure you wanna do this?

883
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,005
Yeah.

884
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:49,046
- You want me to come in with you?
- It's fine.

885
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:51,726
You wait outside. I won't be long.

886
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:40,969
Hi, Ray.

887
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:44,444
Abbie.

888
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:51,845
I was just out with Devon,
and I thought I'd stop by.

889
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:56,604
So, what, do you want to come in?

890
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,321
Yeah. OK.

891
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:01,811
Yeah.

892
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:12,370
So, yeah, still moving in,
but this is basically it.

893
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:15,762
Your standard layout.

894
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:19,970
Yeah, it's a pretty cool place.

895
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:25,131
Uh...

896
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:27,248
You forgot this.

897
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,767
- I think it's your dad's.
- Yeah.

898
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,331
Yeah.

899
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:34,331
Thanks.

900
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:40,406
Oh, hey. Abbie, isn't it?

901
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,045
Hi.

902
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:45,324
Rosie.

903
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:49,251
Ray showing you around?

904
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:50,970
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

905
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,327
It's really retro, isn't it?

906
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:01,967
OK, well, I should be getting
on with this, so...

907
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,243
Is she your girlfriend?

908
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:16,770
Well, I don't...

909
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:18,410
Kind of.

910
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,441
OK, you got it? That's it.

911
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:24,122
- OK.
- Don't drop it.

912
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:27,523
- Fuck.
- I'm going to. It's heavy.

913
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:33,250
Come on!

914
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:36,401
Send it in straight.

915
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,645
Will it m?

916
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,245
Mind your step, Devon.

917
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,129
Why don't you put it right here.

917
01:20:43,305 --> 01:20:49,410
