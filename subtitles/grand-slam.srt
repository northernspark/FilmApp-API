Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

2
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,920
Thank you.

3
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,840
A Professor James Anders
is here to see you, sir.

4
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,720
James Anders?
Who would that be?

5
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,560
James Anders of
West 89th Street, Mark.

6
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,160
40 years, Jim.

7
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,800
42.

8
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,600
Well, if it isn't little Jimmy,
the West Side Terror.

9
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,120
Thank you.

10
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,320
Well Mark, here I am.
A retired old school teacher.

11
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,720
How nice to see you, Jim.

12
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,920
You're one of the few friends of
my childhood, I've never forgotten.

13
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,520
What the hell are you
doing in New York?

14
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,800
Is there something
I can do for you?

15
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,120
Well tell me Mark, is it
true what the papers say?

16
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,440
Is it true that you're involved in
many activities from...

17
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,400
paid murder to high finance?

18
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,360
- Why, Jim?
- I have a deal to propose to you.

19
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,400
Newspapers always exaggerate, Jim.

20
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,360
Besides, they dig up
old stories... you know.

21
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,960
I was a kid. And my father was on his
uppers after the Wall Street crash.

22
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,280
I had to do something. So...
Chicago during Prohibition.

23
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,520
You had to take the first step
in order to arrive at all this.

24
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,040
This is the school in Rio de Janeiro
where I taught history for 30 years.

25
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,840
The Sacred Heart American School.

26
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,600
My classroom...
The end of the class.

27
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,680
That's Sister Clementina
who is photographing me.

28
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,200
And there she is,
Sister Clementina.

29
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,960
A window of my classroom.

30
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,760
And here is what can be see
from that window of my classroom.

31
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,080
The building in front.

32
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,920
Every year, twice a year...

33
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,560
the first Thursday in February
and October at noon.

34
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,320
For 30 years, Mark.

35
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,120
In the building right in front of us.

36
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,400
Diamonds?

37
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,200
- How much?
- 10 million dollars.

38
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,680
And you will have to take charge of
changing the diamonds into dollars.

39
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,840
- And all the rest?
- All the rest I think I've more or less taken care of.

40
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,800
- But how do you...
- I know. I know, theoretically it should be impossible...

41
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,480
After 30 years, Mark...

42
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,120
I think it's all here, right, Mark?

43
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,040
How much money do you need?

44
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,800
Nothing. Between savings and
severance pay, I have enough.

45
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,360
At the moment I need only four men.

46
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:24,000
My God, Jim. You've been a
schoolteacher for 30 years.

47
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,520
I had to do something
to break up the routine.

48
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,200
Here they are. All specialists.

49
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,840
What branch do you need?

50
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,360
Aristocrats, Atomic Scientists,
Card Cheaters, Charities, Clergy, Coal...

51
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,320
Doctors, Drugs...

52
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,640
Electrotechnicians.

53
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,720
Espionage, Gold,
Homosexuals...

54
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,440
Industries, Judges,
Military...

55
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,800
Movies, Newspapers,
Oilmen...

56
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,720
Playboys.

57
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:27,000
Plutonium, Police, Politicians,
Poisons...

58
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,360
Safe Crackers.

59
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,360
Steel, Syndicate Killers,
Television...

60
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,320
Tipsters, Union, Uranium,
Vatican...

61
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,960
Vatican?

62
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,560
Why not?

63
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,760
I can't decide between military
and syndicate killers.

64
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,240
This one, naturally.

65
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,880
All four with clean records.

66
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,960
No police force in the world
knows them or their work.

67
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,120
In their fields the very best.

68
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,840
You'll find all information you need on
those cards. I'll tell them you're coming.

69
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,200
Thank you.

70
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,680
Rome... Paris... London.

71
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,680
And that one's living in New York.

72
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,320
Mr Weiss? There's a gentleman
here to see you.

73
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,960
- Mr. Erich Weiss?
- Ja, bitte? Oh, excuse me, what can I do for you?

74
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,160
I'm James Anders.
Mr. Milford asked me to see you.

75
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:08,000
- Any other questions, Sergeant?
-  You have established the date February 3rd.

76
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,680
But if for some reason February 3rd
would not be possible...

77
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,360
That is a possibility
that must not exist.

78
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,080
The diamonds will arrive in Rio
the first Thursday in February.

79
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,840
The next day they are sorted out and
shipped to every part of the world.

80
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,560
But not this year.

81
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,240
This year, the first Thursday in February
concides with the opening of the carnival in Rio.

82
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,440
The second time
in a half century.

83
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,160
And when it's carnival time in Rio
everything is closed. Everything.

84
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,080
Therefore the diamonds will be
in the safe for four days.

85
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,320
Second time in
a half century.

86
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,240
The safe won't be re-opened
until the following Monday.

87
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,640
But the diamonds...
won't be there of course.

88
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,440
Right, Sergeant?

89
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,920
The money and the passport
with the false name.

90
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,400
A lighter...

91
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,320
The plans for the job.

92
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,040
They must be carried out
meticulously, to the letter.

93
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,600
Everything is accounted for.

94
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,360
Never mind, I'll get out here.

95
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,880
- Good luck.
- Thanks, Professor.

96
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,080
How to get past the corridor
with it's photoelectric cells?

97
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,600
It's difficult, very difficult,
that's certain.

98
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,040
But perhaps...
perhaps it can be done.

99
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,640
These apparatus are like men.

100
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,960
Each has its Achilles Heel.

101
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,720
And we have to find also that
old armored door, Professor.

102
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:13,320
Well the armored door will be opened
in the simplest way. With its key.

103
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,120
It's impossible to make a duplicate so...

104
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,640
We'll have to figure out some way of
getting hold of it for an hour.

105
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,880
That's not your worry.
Let's get back to you, Signor Rossi.

106
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,480
To me? No.

107
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,480
Don't count on me, Professor.

108
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,960
I love the quite life too much.
My work pays well.

109
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,400
I don't want to be involved in
those affairs any longer.

110
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:45,560
Besides, all the way to Rio de Janeiro.
I who have never taken an airplane?

111
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,080
No.

112
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,080
- A million dollars.
- Pardon me?

113
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,400
Your share.
A million dollars.

114
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,160
Are the dolls ready yet,
Signor Rossi?

115
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,200
The dolls!

116
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,480
Did I understand you?
A million dollars?

117
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,520
And since there is no
sound alarm system...

118
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,200
all the rest has been
carefully forseen.

119
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,440
So you only have to take
care of the last detail.

120
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,240
The safe.

121
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,320
Are you sure it's
a Royal 1964?

122
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,720
Mind you Professor,
one year before or one year after...

123
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,560
would make the safe
completely different.

124
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,880
It's a Royal 1964.

125
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,160
Well then, there's a certain
Nilson in Switzerland...

126
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,040
He's opened the Royal in
a Stockholm bank.

127
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,560
The Royal I'm interested in
must be opened in 20 minutes.

128
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,120
Nilson is not able
to do that.

129
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,800
Right.

130
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,280
But why 20 minutes?

131
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,040
20 minutes for the safe...

132
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,280
and 10 minutes to get in and get out
of the vault. In all 30 minutes.

133
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,920
The exact time between the watchmen's
rounds inside the building.

134
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,600
It looks as if you've
forseen everything.

135
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,640
Luncheon is ready
for his Lordship

136
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,160
What are you going to do
about your job?

137
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,440
I can take my holidays
whenever I like.

138
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,800
May I?

139
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,760
Keep it.
You'll find it useful.

140
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,760
Thank you.

141
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,400
And who'll take care of
the armored door?

142
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,120
The key to the armored door
is in the hands of a woman.

143
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,800
A woman is as vulnerable as a safe.

144
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,040
That's why for her too
I found a specialist.

145
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,160
Bonjour, Robert!

146
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,280
Bonjour, Monsieur.

147
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,280
Check the horseshoe, will you?

148
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,360
Monsieur Brisach?
There is a gentleman waiting for you.

149
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,480
Robert Breisach?
I'm Professor Anders.

150
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,040
Robert!

151
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,560
- What's it about?
- A woman.

152
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,640
What woman?

153
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,000
- Very rich?
- This woman has a key.

154
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,040
You'll have to get hold of it
for an hour then put it back.

155
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,000
That's all Mr. Breisach.

156
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,680
- The reason?
- By means of this key...

157
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,920
10 million dollars in diamonds
will change hands.

158
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,080
You get the idea, Mr. Breisach?

159
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,480
Perfectly.

160
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,320
- Seems simple.
- I wouldn't bet on that.

161
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,120
But it's rumored that you
are quite a success with women.

162
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,040
Well I have this reputation on almost
three continents, Mr., Anders is it?

163
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,680
Yes, Anders, that's right.

164
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,760
You may keep this.

165
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,880
- It will help you.
- Robert!

166
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,520
- Excuse me. Goodbye
- Goodbye.

167
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,240
Robert, how long will you make me wait?
Have not you heard me calling?

168
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,320
Darling, my love.
Go to hell!

169
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,960
Robert, no more excuses.
Robert, come back!

170
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,360
- Go to hell!
- Come on now!

171
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,360
Monsieur Jean-Paul Audry?

172
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,400
- Are you Mr. Jean-Paul Audry?
- Yes.

173
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,720
The keys and the papers.

174
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,520
Monsieur, your apartment has
been reserved only for four days.

175
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,240
Perfect.

176
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,680
You'll be leaving us on the
first day of the carnival, sir.

177
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,000
As they say: "That's life."

178
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,760
Thank you.

179
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,840
Thank you.

180
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,440
That's mine.

181
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,800
Didn't you forget something, Sergeant?

182
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,600
- Is this the one?
- Identical.

183
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,280
The Professor's window.

184
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,840
That's a diamond company building.

185
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,440
The management offices
are on the 2nd floor.

186
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,240
That's Mary Ann Davis. She
has the key to the vault.

187
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,440
Where do you think you
are, at Indianapolis?

188
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,840
Didn't you see me coming around the corner?
I am on the right and I have the right of way.

189
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,080
Your hairdo is not becoming.

190
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,000
- What?
- That hairdo is not becoming.

191
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,400
You see? I stopped
your talking.

192
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,880
So many words for
such a little thing.

193
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,440
Give me your address and
I'll send you a check.

194
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,520
Meanwhile, my apologies.

195
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,480
My card.

196
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,960
Lucky guy! He has
a way with them.

197
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,640
Shut up. Let's go to work.

198
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,240
Good evening.

199
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,200
Your check, Madam.

200
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,480
But I'd given you
my office address.

201
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:38,040
Well, your license plate, kind
secretary at the automobile club...

202
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,760
...here I am.

203
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,560
Thank you. You've been
very kind. Good night.

204
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,880
Please...

205
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,200
I've been in Rio for three days
and you're the only person I know.

206
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,480
Could you be my guide in
this huge metropolis,

207
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,480
in which I feel so
lonely and lost?

208
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,920
- I haven't the time Monsieur.
- Jean-Paul.

209
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,480
It should be easy to find the
kind of guide you're looking for.

210
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,240
- The city is full of them.
- Why do you say that?

211
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,520
I haven't asked you to sleep with me.
Therefore I don't see why you...

212
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,280
Senhora.

213
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,400
- This came for you.
- For me?

214
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,920
<i>I have been very discourteous to you.
I hope these flowers will make you forgive me.</i>

215
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,360
<i>Unhappily yours, Jean-Paul Audry</i>

216
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,320
<i>I also have been very unkind to you.</i>

217
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,000
<i>I hope these flowers will
help you forgive me.</i>

218
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,280
<i>Goodbye Monsieur Audry.
And that's enough!</i>

219
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,560
Hey, handsome!

220
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,960
How are you doing?

221
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,760
Breaking in, it's the first day

222
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,440
Remember you only have another two days.
So you'd better pull yourself together.

223
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,280
- Jawoll, mein General!
- Look pretty-boy...

224
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,240
I don't like guys
like you.

225
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,240
I don't like you either.
So what?

226
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,560
Sweet dreams, mein General.

227
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,440
One, two, three, four...

228
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,560
Yes?

229
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,040
We in the office, we wondered if today
might be your birthday, Senhorita Davis.

230
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,440
Senhorita Davis.

231
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,000
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

232
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,400
Hello.

233
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,240
For you.

234
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,720
Where are we going?

235
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:26,160
And after I finished my schooling, I went
to work for the diamond company.

236
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:31,280
First as a simple typist, then as
assistant to the general manager.

237
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,080
The faithful,
irreplacable secretary.

238
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,920
That's me.

239
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,960
That's all there
is to my life.

240
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,840
Why do you hide your eyes?

241
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,200
I'm near-sighted.

242
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,600
I feel protected with them on.

243
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,560
Protected from what?

244
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,520
It's very beautiful here, isn't it?

245
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,040
No thank you.

246
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,920
Tell me what...
tell me something about you.

247
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,440
What do you do
besides buy flowers?

248
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,760
He finally made it.

249
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,400
But I don't really envy him.
She's not exactly pretty.

250
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:52,120
It's all the same for him. Pretty or ugly.
Young or old. It's his work.

251
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,200
I want to call you
by your first name.

252
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,720
Alright.

253
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,120
And I want to kiss you.

254
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,840
Why?

255
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,840
What's wrong?

256
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,920
Goodbye, Jean-Paul.

257
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,240
But why?

258
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,200
It's been nice meeting you,
you gave me a lovely day...

259
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,120
now it's finished.

260
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,680
No, wait. Don't be silly.

261
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,080
Let me go, Jean-Paul!

262
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,080
Mary Ann, now come on...

263
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,760
I don't want to see you again
and don't follow me anymore.

264
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,640
- Don't be silly. It's all crazy.
- Just leave me alone!

265
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,680
- Driver.
- Mary Ann!

266
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,680
Mary Ann!

267
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,280
- Lock the door, please.
- It's already done.

268
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:59,200
I'll perforate from the inside in order
to find the right point of penetration.

269
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:03,960
There are only two spots which
will unblock the whole mechanism.

270
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,480
Let's begin with this one.
The drill, please.

271
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,920
Thank you.

272
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,320
It enters as if
it were butter.

273
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,400
That's exactly the
basic problem, old man.

274
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,080
You believe you are beginning
to make some headway...

275
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,960
when suddenly you come
upon the unexpected.

276
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,440
Seven minutes
for the drilling.

277
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,320
I think I can still gain
a couple of minutes.

278
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,360
Now let's sum it up. The watchmen come
out of the manager's office you were in.

279
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,600
Four minutes for the corridor
of the photoelectric cell.

280
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,720
Four minutes to return.

281
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,840
- Right?
- Right.

282
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,440
We're in front of
the steel door....

283
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,640
the key.

284
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,480
One minute to open
and close the door.

285
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,920
- And here's the Royal.
- 20 minutes for all the work on the safe.

286
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,960
Nine minutes to get to
the safe and get back.

287
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,080
20 minutes for us
to get the diamonds.

288
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,920
- 29 minutes altogether.
- Well, we have a 1 minute safety margin.

289
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,840
All in all not too bad.

290
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,520
Excuse me, I can't stand this heat
any longer. I'm going to get a bit of air.

291
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,240
Well, I'm going too.
Until tomorrow.

292
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,360
Jean-Paul?

293
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,360
Great day tomorrow, eh?

294
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,160
Good night.

295
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:22,480
Parlez-vous français? Sprechen Sie deutsch?
Do you speak english?

296
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,800
My name is... Agostino.

297
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,400
I am... Setuaka.

298
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,200
Pleased to meet you, Setuaka.

299
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,720
You don't have any clothes?

300
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,720
You have a man.

301
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,960
I have to go, Agostino.

302
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,840
Everyone, to your places!

303
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,040
Too far away.
She couldn't have seen us.

304
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,480
We are ready for
the alarm test.

305
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,720
What's that?

306
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,240
They've done it.
They've put in the Grand Slam 70.

307
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:14,200
That, gentlemen, is the
Grand Slam 70.

308
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:17,160
A system of very sensitive
microphones...

309
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,760
That registers the
slightest noise.

310
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,920
Any noise that is
above 14 decibles...

311
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,040
sets off the alarm.

312
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,520
Not too good, is it?

313
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,120
Well, we might as well
prepare our suitcases.

314
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,120
You're not preparing
anything.

315
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:35,800
You stay here until I tell you
what to do. And you. And you.

316
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:40,760
if you are really the supermen everybody
says, crazy your brains! Tread blood!

317
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,880
But find a solution.

318
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,840
Me and the men I lead
never give up, understand?

319
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:50,440
Kill yourself on those machines! But
tonight the diamonds will be ours.

320
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,560
Is that clear?

321
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,680
I think it's crazy.

322
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,280
Professor says, "go to Rio...

323
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:00,920
and do this. And this..."
Looks like a promenade.

324
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,680
Instead it's a
highway to prison.

325
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:07,920
And I'm not going to prison
to make you happy, General.

326
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,120
Put that in the little
bit of brain you have!

327
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,640
The Professor couldn't
have told us.

328
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,480
Grand Slam 70 came
out only two months ago.

329
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,720
Naturally, he couldn't have known.

330
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,400
You know where you
can put your reasoning?

331
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,840
I've never taken a risk in my life.
Not taking any now.

332
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:30,080
You and Agostino will never
be able to beat that gadget.

333
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,840
So, I'm saying goodbye
to you guys.

334
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,960
And forget that I exist.

335
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,480
You dirty pimp! You're only good
for charming old maids.

336
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,680
You're not even able
to do a man's job.

337
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,720
Now put one thing in that
crusted brain of yours.

338
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,960
You're not moving from here
until I say so.

339
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,160
And take some advice...

340
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,480
Obey. You'd better obey, buster...

341
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,960
Or you want me to smash in
that beautiful face of yours?

342
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,960
Everybody shut up, I mean it!

343
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,520
Shut up.

344
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,840
The Grand Slam 70
foresaw that too.

345
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,840
Blocking the microphones...

346
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,920
interrupts the circuits and
sets the sound box off.

347
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
We can cut the lines.

348
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:37,400
Naturally... Any temperance
sets off the sound box.

349
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,320
Obvious.

350
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,320
Therefore it's difficult.

351
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,480
Very difficult.

352
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,480
But perhaps...

353
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,760
Perhaps it can be done.

354
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,480
But you, Gregg, must shorten
the time of your work.

355
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,960
Leave me alone for a while
and I will show you.

356
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:08,080
I left the sound meter
here somewhere.

357
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,720
A phonometer.

358
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,200
Where has he gone?

359
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,440
Wait, I'm coming!

360
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,960
So you packed your
suitcase, huh?

361
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,640
Not on the face,
we need it.

362
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,560
Come on, get up.
I won't hurt you anymore.

363
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,840
The key. Tonight.

364
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,120
We'll pull it off, my friend.

365
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:02,080
10:30 at the corner of the square.
With the key.

366
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,640
Don't count on me.

367
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,840
I've tried everything.

368
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,520
That's not a woman,
that's piece of ice.

369
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:21,640
I'll never be able to get the key.
Can't you make another one, Gregg?

370
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,760
- Forge one.
- Shut up, you know we can't do that.

371
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:29,200
- And there's no time.
- We can't make a key like that.

372
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:34,280
Once it's in the keyhole, it opens and closes
a magnetic field that we don't know anything about.

373
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,200
You'll get me the key.

374
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,960
If you're not able to
convince her, kill her.

375
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:48,760
- But I never...
- Easiest thing in the world. Pull the trigger.

376
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,160
Maybe you'll be
able to do that.

377
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,280
I'll take his passport.

378
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:07,960
Without the key, everything
could turn into smoke.

379
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,800
Jean-Paul, you're here...

380
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,400
I'm so glad you came.

381
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,920
But I thought that you were...

382
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,200
Come in.

383
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:20,800
Come in.

384
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,040
Is this better?

385
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,200
Do you still want that kiss?

386
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,120
Yes, why?

387
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,560
Because I do, Jean-Paul.

388
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,240
Very much.

389
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,760
- It's time.
- Alright.

390
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:38,680
- Mary Ann.
- Yes?

391
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:43,480
I've finished my cigarettes.
Is there a store nearby where I can buy some?

392
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:45,200
Just a minute.

393
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:50,360
Jean-Paul.

394
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,200
Aren't these the
cigarettes you smoke?

395
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,280
I remembered and
bought them for you.

396
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:03,120
Dinner will be ready
in a few minutes.

397
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:06,680
Caviar, sir...

398
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:13,080
Pheasant and Cognac...

399
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,040
Tropical salad...

400
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,320
Strawberry pie.

401
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:34,200
I'll be right back.
I've forgeotten something.

402
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,200
- What?
- Champagne.

403
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,520
Jean-Paul, there's Champagne here.

404
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:40,720
I'll go fix dinner.

405
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:02,400
Oh, how silly!

406
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:10,080
I've broken the only bottle
of Champagne I had.

407
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:14,400
Do you mind terribly going out to buy another?
There's a store open all night just a block away.

408
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:17,640
- I'm sorry, darling
- Never mind, I'll be right back.

409
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,760
- Ready?
- Ready.

410
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:37,560
10 seconds.

411
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:16,200
Let's go.

412
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:47,760
Get going.

413
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:12,760
The nitroglycerin.

414
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:26,600
- Ready?
- Ready.

415
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:27,840
Go.

416
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,000
- Voilà!
- Jean-Paul, I was really beginning to worry.

417
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:12,840
- Jean-Paul!
- Champagne, Madame!

418
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,320
- It will cost you a kiss.
- Is that all?

419
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:19,360
If you give me another kiss,
I'll tell you a secret.

420
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:23,560
- The secret.
- I am hungry!

421
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:31,000
30 minutes from now.

422
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,320
Jean-Paul...

423
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:56,760
Couldn't you put off leaving
for a few days at least?

424
01:30:57,720 --> 01:30:59,920
No, it's not possible.

425
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:02,960
But I'll be back in
2 weeks at the latest.

426
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:14,760
- Who could that be at this hour?
- Stay there, it's for me.

427
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:21,880
Oh thank you.
You arrived in time!

428
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:26,200
Have this for your trouble.

429
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:38,640
Who was it?

430
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:41,840
Et voilà.
For you Madame.

431
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:51,680
Jean-Paul, you're really crazy.

432
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:00,240
I must go now.
It's very late.

433
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,360
Goodbye, Mary Ann.

434
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:17,400
My jacket.

435
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:45,880
Mary Ann, when I get back to Rio
could you take a few days off?

436
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:12,360
I'd like to take a trip.
Maybe up the Amazon or any place you'd like.

437
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:15,120
You choose the place.

438
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:18,960
If this business comes off...

439
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:22,240
and I think it will,
I'll have some money to throw away.

440
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:29,240
Just think my dear, if we hadn't met
each other, I would have gone back to Europe.

441
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:34,680
Mais "c'est la vie",
eh, Mary Ann?

442
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:47,920
Hey, why don't you
say anything?

443
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:52,360
Well talk about it
when you get back.

444
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:56,560
Please go away.
Don't say anything more.

445
01:33:57,800 --> 01:33:59,920
Please don't come any closer.

446
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:03,200
Have a nice trip, Jean-Paul...

447
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:05,280
and... good luck.

448
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:09,400
Good luck to you, Mary Ann.

449
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:44,720
For me?

450
01:40:51,080 --> 01:40:52,680
It's wonderful!

451
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:58,640
Thank you, Agostino.
Thank you very much.

452
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:00,960
It's nothing.

453
01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:05,640
- What's the matter?
- I'm going away.

454
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:07,360
Rome.

455
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:14,640
Goodbye, Setuaka.

456
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:18,880
Adios, Agostino.

457
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:37,880
Chin up, Agostino. We all
must give up something.

458
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:41,600
In a short while we'll all be back in dear
old Europe. Don't make that face now, come on.

459
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,200
Leave me alone.
Who cares about you?

460
01:41:44,280 --> 01:41:47,640
Come on, we have only
45 minutes to catch a plane.

461
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:44,040
Here.

462
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:20,080
We still have 35 minutes.
We're on time all right.

463
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:22,680
If I could only have a coffee.

464
01:43:23,080 --> 01:43:24,880
I just want to sleep.

465
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:27,200
Have a tough night, handsome?

466
01:43:29,320 --> 01:43:30,920
You know something, Sergeant.

467
01:43:31,320 --> 01:43:33,920
You bucked me from the
first time I've ever seen you.

468
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:37,560
Well it's all over now and
I don't have to take it anymore from you.

469
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:13,240
Now then Miss Davis, tell me, did
this friend of yours know of your work?

470
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:16,400
Miss Davis, how long have you
known the young man?

471
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:19,000
You told us his first
name was Jean-Paul.

472
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:20,800
His surname?

473
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:22,240
Miss Davis!

474
01:44:22,440 --> 01:44:25,520
Your lack of responsibility
will cost you your job.

475
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:28,680
Where did you meet him?
Did he say where he was going?

476
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:32,120
I warn you Miss Davis, you'd better tell us.
Describe him. What did he look like?

477
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,200
- The police!
- Let's turn back.

478
01:44:40,360 --> 01:44:42,760
Morning.
What's going on here?

479
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:44,880
Documents, please.

480
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:20,280
Documents.

481
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:43,080
Get out.

482
01:45:44,440 --> 01:45:45,600
Get out!

483
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:53,560
- Give me the nitro.
- No.

484
01:45:53,640 --> 01:45:55,640
Not the nitroglycerin.

485
01:45:56,440 --> 01:45:57,560
Do as I said!

486
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:59,280
No, no.

487
01:46:09,080 --> 01:46:10,520
Take the wheel.

488
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:43,880
Come on!

489
01:46:58,360 --> 01:46:59,320
No!

490
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:02,000
Erich!

491
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:05,560
No!

492
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:09,880
No!

493
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:12,360
Erich!

494
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:20,800
No, no!

495
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:18,160
Setuaka!

496
01:48:20,200 --> 01:48:21,320
Setuaka!

497
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:33,400
Hold it!

498
01:48:34,280 --> 01:48:35,440
Setuaka!

499
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:09,440
Welcome to Rome, Mary Ann.

500
01:51:09,560 --> 01:51:11,840
It's a pleasure to see
you again, Professor.

501
01:51:11,960 --> 01:51:13,400
Sit down, please.

502
01:51:53,280 --> 01:51:55,280
Congratulations, Mary Ann

503
01:51:55,880 --> 01:51:57,960
You've done a mgnificent job.

504
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:01,160
You had forseen everything, Professor.

505
01:52:01,320 --> 01:52:03,920
Even to your dear friend, Milford.

506
01:52:04,200 --> 01:52:07,280
Milford, I coudn't take
any chances on him.

507
01:52:08,040 --> 01:52:10,440
Did you have any trouble
changing bags?

508
01:52:10,720 --> 01:52:14,840
A bit. The manager and the guards only
left me alone in my office for a few seconds.

509
01:52:15,240 --> 01:52:17,080
You had to work fast.

510
01:52:29,320 --> 01:52:32,680
Thieves! Stop him!
Thieves!

511
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:36,240
- No! Thieves!
- Please, no, please, Mary Ann.

512
01:52:36,440 --> 01:52:38,160
What's happened?
I am going to call the police.

513
01:52:38,240 --> 01:52:41,320
No, no, no. It's not important.
Nothing important, really.

514
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:44,480
Believe me, please.

515
01:52:45,305 --> 01:52:51,306
