00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:00,861
Please verify that the P-one ATA removal

3
00:02:00,862 --> 00:02:02,969
on replacement cap part
one and two are complete.

4
00:02:03,745 --> 00:02:10,220
DMA M-one, M-two, M-three and M four
are complete. - Okay. Copy that, Explorer.

5
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:15,637
Dr. Stone, Houston. Medical is
concerned about your ECG readings.

6
00:02:16,404 --> 00:02:20,348
I'm fine, Houston.
- Well, Medical doesn't agree, Doc.

7
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:24,021
Are you feeling nauseous?
- Not any more than usual, Houston.

8
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:25,705
Diagnostics are green.

9
00:02:26,339 --> 00:02:29,459
Link to communications card
ready for data reception.

10
00:02:30,831 --> 00:02:33,956
If this works, when we touch down tomorrow,
I'm buying all you guys a round of drinks.

11
00:02:34,893 --> 00:02:36,358
That's a date, Doctor.

12
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:39,089
Just remember, Houston's
partial to margaritas.

13
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,307
Booting comms card now.

14
00:02:43,406 --> 00:02:45,117
Please confirm link.

15
00:02:45,854 --> 00:02:48,287
That's a negative,
we're not seeing any data.

16
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:51,923
Standby, Houston, I'm
gonna reboot the comms card.

17
00:02:52,023 --> 00:02:53,579
Standing by.

18
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:57,684
Houston, I have a bad feeling
about this mission. - Please expand.

19
00:02:58,137 --> 00:03:00,012
Okay, let me tell you a story.

20
00:03:00,111 --> 00:03:03,907
It was ninety-six. I'd been
up here for forty-two days.

21
00:03:04,116 --> 00:03:06,320
Every time I passed
over Texas, I looked down

22
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:10,097
knowing that Mrs. Kowalski
was looking up, thinking of me.

23
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:12,924
Six weeks I'm
blowing kisses at that woman.

24
00:03:13,124 --> 00:03:17,187
Then we land at Edwards and I find out
that she's run off with this lawyer.

25
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:20,374
So, I packed my car, and
I headed to... - ... Tijuana.

26
00:03:20,474 --> 00:03:22,540
You've told this story, Kowalski.

27
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,336
As Houston recalls, she, uh,
took off in your seventy-four GTO.

28
00:03:26,436 --> 00:03:29,819
Engineering requests fuel
status on the jetpack prototype.

29
00:03:30,494 --> 00:03:33,391
Five hours off the reservation and
I show thirty percent drain.

30
00:03:34,162 --> 00:03:36,531
Give my compliments to Engineering.

31
00:03:36,844 --> 00:03:38,813
Except for a slight malfunction
in the nulling of the roll axis,

32
00:03:38,914 --> 00:03:41,345
this jetpack is one
prime piece of thrust.

33
00:03:42,234 --> 00:03:43,788
Engineering says thank you.

34
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:46,665
Tell 'em I still prefer my
sixty-seven Corvette, though.

35
00:03:46,898 --> 00:03:49,900
Speaking of which, did I ever tell you...
- We know the Corvette story, Matt.

36
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:53,486
Even Engineering?
- Especially Engineering.

37
00:03:54,718 --> 00:03:56,342
We're going to miss you, Matt.

38
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:00,463
Comms card reboot in progress.
- Thank you, Doctor.

39
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:02,447
Shariff, what's your status?

40
00:04:02,963 --> 00:04:06,585
Nearly there. Replacing battery
module A-one and C.

41
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,149
Ccould you be a little more specific?

42
00:04:10,248 --> 00:04:12,681
Indeterminate estimates
make Houston anxious.

43
00:04:13,431 --> 00:04:15,566
No, Houston. Don't be anxious.

44
00:04:15,665 --> 00:04:17,456
Anxiety's not
good for the heart.

45
00:04:18,564 --> 00:04:20,699
System is ready to reactivate.

46
00:04:21,607 --> 00:04:25,164
Hubble telescope engaged.
Upgrade fully functional.

47
00:04:25,371 --> 00:04:27,837
That applause you hear
is for you, Shariff.

48
00:04:28,037 --> 00:04:30,583
Congratulations. Kick back,
take the rest of the day off.

49
00:04:36,023 --> 00:04:39,818
Matt, do you have a visual on just what
Mission Specialist Shariff is doing up there?

50
00:04:40,829 --> 00:04:43,674
He appears to be doing
some form of the Macarena.

51
00:04:44,173 --> 00:04:47,544
But that would be just a best-guess
scenario on my part.

52
00:04:48,014 --> 00:04:52,542
Dr. Stone, Houston. Medical now have you with
a temperature drop to thirty-five-point-nine

53
00:04:52,641 --> 00:04:55,182
and a heart-rate rise to seventy.

54
00:04:56,117 --> 00:04:59,551
How are you feeling?
- Houston, I'm fine.

55
00:04:59,814 --> 00:05:02,990
It's just keeping your lunch down
in zero-G is harder than it looks.

56
00:05:03,995 --> 00:05:07,164
Dr. Stone, Medical is asking
if you want to return to Explorer.

57
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:11,100
Negative. We've been here a week,
Houston. Let's just finish this.

58
00:05:11,473 --> 00:05:14,943
Card is up.
- No, that's a negative.

59
00:05:15,043 --> 00:05:17,851
I'm afraid we're getting
nothing on this end, Doctor.

60
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:22,481
Try again.
- No, still nothing.

61
00:05:24,995 --> 00:05:28,398
Houston, can you please turn
that music off? - Kowalski.

62
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,273
Not a problem.

63
00:05:30,556 --> 00:05:32,210
Thank you, Kowalski.

64
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:38,360
Now, Houston?
- That's a negative.

65
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,497
Could Houston be
misinterpreting the data?

66
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,280
Well, we're not receiving any data.

67
00:05:45,056 --> 00:05:48,604
Engineering is recommending
a vis-check for component damage.

68
00:05:50,164 --> 00:05:52,050
Let me see what's going on.

69
00:05:53,112 --> 00:05:55,112
What have we got?

70
00:06:02,723 --> 00:06:05,106
Visual examination doesn't
reveal any damaged components.

71
00:06:05,206 --> 00:06:07,757
The problem must be originating
from the comms panel.

72
00:06:08,227 --> 00:06:10,448
Yeah, that seems to be the case.

73
00:06:10,695 --> 00:06:13,334
Engineering admits that you
warned us that this could happen.

74
00:06:14,304 --> 00:06:16,682
That's as close to an apology
as you're going to get from them.

75
00:06:16,684 --> 00:06:18,518
We should have listened to you, Doc.

76
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,189
Get working. - Well, ooks like we're
going to have to improvise.

77
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,599
I'm on it.
- How long do you think it'll take you?

78
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:29,192
One hour.
- Outstanding.

79
00:06:29,427 --> 00:06:32,313
Installing your system in the
Hubble is the purpose of this mission

80
00:06:32,516 --> 00:06:34,563
and so we appreciate
your patience, Doctor.

81
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:38,184
Kowalski, we... we know you don't
care about things like this,

82
00:06:38,284 --> 00:06:41,028
but, uh, for your information, this
delay is not gonna be long enough

83
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:44,023
for you to break Anatoly
Solovyev's spacewalking record.

84
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:48,035
It seems like you're gonna be left...
- Seventy-five minutes shy?

85
00:06:48,238 --> 00:06:50,049
Never crossed my mind.

86
00:06:50,642 --> 00:06:55,955
Matt... it's been a privilege.
- Right back at you, Houston.

87
00:06:56,715 --> 00:06:58,762
Enjoy your last walk.

88
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,464
Am I a go to assist Dr. Stone in
removing the panel?

89
00:07:02,712 --> 00:07:05,203
Assistance appreciated.
- Permission granted.

90
00:07:05,303 --> 00:07:06,915
Thank you, Houston.

91
00:07:07,588 --> 00:07:10,086
Mind if I join the fun?
- Certainly.

92
00:07:10,185 --> 00:07:11,381
How you feeling?

93
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:15,234
Like a Chihuahua that's
being tumble-dried.

94
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,749
Well, it's been a rough week.

95
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:20,302
If it makes you feel any
better, I coughed up everything

96
00:07:20,303 --> 00:07:22,757
but my kidneys on my first ride.

97
00:07:23,805 --> 00:07:25,184
Shit.

98
00:07:31,457 --> 00:07:32,720
Sorry.

99
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:37,847
I'm used to a basement lab in a hospital
where things fall to the floor. Thank you.

100
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:43,266
Well, you're the genius up here.
I only drive the bus.

101
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:48,150
Yeah, well, call me a genius if I can get
this board initialized in the next hour.

102
00:07:48,354 --> 00:07:51,238
Explorer, this is Houston.
- Go ahead, Houston.

103
00:07:51,521 --> 00:07:55,613
NORAD reports a Russian satellite
has incurred a missile strike.

104
00:07:55,953 --> 00:08:00,678
The impact has created a cloud of debris
orbiting at twenty thousand miles per hour.

105
00:08:01,225 --> 00:08:04,667
Current debris orbit does not
overlap with your trajectory.

106
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:08,680
We'll keep you posted on any
developments. - Copy that, Houston.

107
00:08:09,246 --> 00:08:14,349
Should we... Should we be worried? - No,
let's let the boys down there worry for us.

108
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,642
Explorer, engage arm
and pivot to cargo bay.

109
00:08:18,741 --> 00:08:20,639
Stand by for arm maneuver.

110
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,790
So, doc, now that you work for
NASA, how do you like us?

111
00:08:24,996 --> 00:08:27,184
Kind of like winning
the lottery, huh?

112
00:08:27,445 --> 00:08:30,270
I was just happy that they didn't
cut the funding to my research.

113
00:08:30,371 --> 00:08:32,801
How long was your training?
- Six months.

114
00:08:32,901 --> 00:08:34,707
Including holidays?
- Mm-hm.

115
00:08:34,908 --> 00:08:39,053
So, what is this scanning system?
- Oh, nothing Matt.

116
00:08:39,153 --> 00:08:41,795
It's just a new set of eyes to
scan the edge of the universe.

117
00:08:42,094 --> 00:08:45,071
It's designed for hospital use,
but this one's a prototype.

118
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:47,419
Stand by for locking.

119
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:52,815
Listen, they don't bankroll prototypes.
Even for your pretty blue eyes.

120
00:08:53,939 --> 00:08:56,517
Well, my eyes are brown.

121
00:08:58,155 --> 00:09:00,341
Right now, your eyes are
bloodshot.

122
00:09:00,965 --> 00:09:02,233
Kowalski!

123
00:09:02,455 --> 00:09:06,449
Is this great, or
what? Woo-hoo-hoo!

124
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,042
And to think he went to Harvard.

125
00:09:14,065 --> 00:09:16,009
You gotta admit one thing:

126
00:09:17,046 --> 00:09:19,142
Can't beat the view.

127
00:09:23,172 --> 00:09:25,681
So, what do you like
about being up here?

128
00:09:27,636 --> 00:09:29,073
The silence.

129
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,773
I could get used to it.

130
00:09:53,268 --> 00:09:54,723
Terrific.

131
00:09:54,924 --> 00:09:57,832
Houston, from first inspection,
comms panel appears to be dead.

132
00:09:57,932 --> 00:10:00,562
Am I a go to cut link to auxiliary?

133
00:10:00,856 --> 00:10:03,331
You're the expert, doctor.
It's your call.

134
00:10:03,431 --> 00:10:05,871
Houston, I have a bad
feeling about this mission.

135
00:10:06,133 --> 00:10:08,913
Please elaborate.
- It's the same feeling

136
00:10:09,013 --> 00:10:10,980
I had about Mardi Gras in 1987.

137
00:10:12,414 --> 00:10:13,707
That is affirmative.

138
00:10:13,971 --> 00:10:18,507
Surprisingly, Control hasn't heard
the Mardi Gras story. Please proceed.

139
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:21,372
Well, it's day one, and I'm
bumping my way down Bourbon Street

140
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:24,744
looking for a sister
of a friend of mine.

141
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:28,307
Streets are full of people. I'm thinking
there's no way I'm gonna find this girl.

142
00:10:28,406 --> 00:10:31,770
Proceeding to override. - Then all of the
sudden, I look up, and there she is,

143
00:10:31,871 --> 00:10:34,657
and I'm about to yell out,
and I see she's holding hands

144
00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:38,881
with some short, hairy guy in board
shorts and a Margaritaville shirt.

145
00:10:38,981 --> 00:10:42,234
And then I realize that
this guy is not a guy.

146
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,324
That my girl is holding hands with a...

147
00:10:44,424 --> 00:10:46,043
ISS, this is Houston.
- Proceed, Houston.

148
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,962
Explorer, this is Houston.
- Go ahead, Houston.

149
00:10:49,062 --> 00:10:51,755
Mission abort. Repeat. Mission abort.

150
00:10:51,855 --> 00:10:53,991
Initiate emergency
disconnect from Hubble.

151
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:58,206
Begin reentry procedure. ISS,
initiate emergency evacuation.

152
00:10:58,305 --> 00:11:01,517
Copy all, Houston, and in work.
Matt, immediate return to Explorer.

153
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:04,339
Repeat, immediate
return to Explorer. - Copy.

154
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,728
Explorer, prep airlock.
- Airlock engaged,

155
00:11:06,828 --> 00:11:08,890
ready to receive.
- Houston, elaborate.

156
00:11:08,964 --> 00:11:11,945
Debris from the missile strike has
caused a chain reaction,

157
00:11:12,014 --> 00:11:14,582
hitting other satellites
and creating new debris.

158
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,726
Traveling faster than a high-speed
bullet up towards your altitude.

159
00:11:18,192 --> 00:11:20,031
All copy?
- Copy all.

160
00:11:20,238 --> 00:11:23,121
Put a bow on it, Dr. Stone.
- I can't.

161
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,665
The board is still initializing.
- I'm not gonna ask you again.

162
00:11:26,765 --> 00:11:29,755
One second.
- Not one second. Now.

163
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,162
Shut it down.

164
00:11:31,505 --> 00:11:34,707
That's an order.
- Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

165
00:11:34,808 --> 00:11:36,174
I'm done. I'm done.

166
00:11:36,274 --> 00:11:38,847
Kowalski, initiate emergency
disconnect from the Hubble.

167
00:11:38,946 --> 00:11:41,312
All right, Shariff, let's do this.
- Roger, Matt.

168
00:11:41,517 --> 00:11:44,402
Houston, update.
- Well, we have a full-on chain reaction.

169
00:11:44,903 --> 00:11:46,728
It's been confirmed that it's
the unintentional side effect

170
00:11:46,829 --> 00:11:49,809
of the Russians striking
one of their own satellites.

171
00:11:50,152 --> 00:11:53,191
They shot down their own satellite?
- Right of disposal.

172
00:11:53,292 --> 00:11:55,994
Most likely a spy sat gone
bad. Now it's shrapnel.

173
00:11:56,194 --> 00:11:58,327
Explorer, ready to disengage HST.

174
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:04,238
Locks releasing in three... two... one.
- Explorer, new data coming through.

175
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:07,077
What's the blowback, Houston?
- It's not good.

176
00:12:07,177 --> 00:12:09,513
Most of our systems are gone.

177
00:12:09,613 --> 00:12:13,083
Debris chain reaction is out of
control and rapidly expanding.

178
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:16,042
Multiple satellites are down, and
they keep on falling.

179
00:12:16,141 --> 00:12:19,158
Define 'multiple satellites. '
- Most of them are gone.

180
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,451
Telecommunication systems are dead.

181
00:12:21,551 --> 00:12:23,902
Expect a communication
blackout at any moment.

182
00:12:24,003 --> 00:12:26,837
Kowalski, visual of debris at nine o'clock.
- Half of North America

183
00:12:26,937 --> 00:12:28,609
just lost their Facebook.

184
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:31,352
Explorer, repeat, expect a
communication blackout

185
00:12:31,453 --> 00:12:32,973
at any moment.

186
00:12:33,348 --> 00:12:36,332
Copy that, Houston.
- Explorer, this is Kowalski,

187
00:12:36,432 --> 00:12:40,567
confirming visual contact with debris.
Debris is from a BSE sat. - Heads up!

188
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:44,058
To repeat, I have...
- Dr. Stone requesting faster transport.

189
00:12:44,435 --> 00:12:46,063
We have to go. We have to go, go, go!

190
00:12:46,064 --> 00:12:49,133
Kennedy reports meteorologicalconditions
no-go for re-entry.

191
00:12:49,658 --> 00:12:54,850
Houston, Explorer. Copy. Explorer, Dr. Stone
requesting faster transport to bay area.

192
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:57,566
Explorer, do you copy?
- Explorer, permission to retrieve Dr. Stone.

193
00:12:57,869 --> 00:12:59,514
You're a go, Kowalski.

194
00:12:59,798 --> 00:13:02,267
Houston, this is Explorer, copy.

195
00:13:02,555 --> 00:13:05,943
All right. - We've lost
Houston. We've lost Houston.

196
00:13:06,676 --> 00:13:09,458
Unstrap. Look, we need to
get the hell out of here. - All right.

197
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:12,559
Need some help there, Matt?
- No, don't wait for us. - It's stuck!

198
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,941
Man down! Man down!

199
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:20,306
Houston, this is Explorer, copy. Houston,
this is Explorer, copy. Kowalski, repor...

200
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,371
Explorer's been hit! - Explorer, do
you read? Explorer, over! Explorer!

201
00:13:29,581 --> 00:13:33,183
Astronaut is off structure!
Dr. Stone is off structure!

202
00:13:33,283 --> 00:13:36,010
Dr. Stone, detach! - No!
- You must detach!

203
00:13:36,111 --> 00:13:38,565
If you don't detach, that
arm's gonna carry you too far!

204
00:13:38,853 --> 00:13:40,896
Listen to my voice!
You need to focus!

205
00:13:40,996 --> 00:13:43,272
I'm losing visual of you.

206
00:13:43,371 --> 00:13:45,271
In a few seconds, I won't
be able to track you.

207
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:47,407
You need to detach!
I can't see you anymore!

208
00:13:47,507 --> 00:13:50,475
Do it now!
- I'm trying! I'm trying! I'm trying!

209
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,954
Houston, I've lost visual of Dr. Stone.

210
00:13:55,761 --> 00:13:57,780
Houston, I've lost visual of Dr. Stone.

211
00:14:06,785 --> 00:14:09,983
Dr. Stone, do you copy?
Repeat, do you copy?

212
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:13,201
Yes, yes, yes. I copy! I'm detached!
- Give me your position.

213
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,863
I don't know! I don't know! I'm
spinning! I can't... I can't...

214
00:14:17,068 --> 00:14:21,051
Report your position. - GPS is
down. It's down, I can't...

215
00:14:21,086 --> 00:14:24,351
Give me a visual.
- I told you, nothing. I see nothing!

216
00:14:24,351 --> 00:14:28,685
Do you have a visual of Explorer? - No. No.
- Do you have a visual of ISS? - No.

217
00:14:28,687 --> 00:14:32,508
You need to focus. Anything, use the
sun and the Earth, give me coordinates.

218
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,177
I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!

219
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:38,903
Give me coordinates!
Dr. Stone, do you copy?

220
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:41,630
Repeat, do you copy?

221
00:14:42,767 --> 00:14:46,315
Give me your position!
Report your position.

222
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:49,744
Do you have a visual of Explorer?

223
00:14:49,967 --> 00:14:51,866
Do you have a visual of ISS?

224
00:14:51,867 --> 00:14:53,368
I need you to focus. Anything.

225
00:14:53,369 --> 00:14:55,641
Use the sun and the
Earth, give me coordinates.

226
00:14:55,642 --> 00:14:57,836
Give me coordinates.

227
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:34,094
Kowalski? Kowalski, do you copy?

228
00:15:35,732 --> 00:15:39,680
Kowalski... I have... have a vis...
Kowalski, I have a visual.

229
00:15:39,883 --> 00:15:45,662
I have... have a visual of Explorer.
With north at... twelve o'clock

230
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:50,358
and the shuttle is at
the center of the dial.

231
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:58,360
I can see... I can see the Chinese station.
No, it's the International Space Station.

232
00:15:58,681 --> 00:16:00,539
ISS is at...

233
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:03,975
ISS is at seven o'clock.

234
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,965
Lieutenant Kowalski, do you copy?

235
00:16:20,031 --> 00:16:22,188
Explorer, do you... do you copy?

236
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,082
Houston, do you copy?

237
00:16:37,766 --> 00:16:41,112
Houston, this is Mission
Specialist Ryan Stone.

238
00:16:41,211 --> 00:16:43,761
I am off structure and I am drifting.

239
00:16:43,861 --> 00:16:45,170
Do you copy?

240
00:16:51,862 --> 00:16:53,149
Anyone?

241
00:16:57,321 --> 00:16:58,558
Anybody?

242
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:03,220
Do you copy?

243
00:17:06,282 --> 00:17:07,338
Please copy.

244
00:17:10,187 --> 00:17:11,995
Please.

245
00:17:31,315 --> 00:17:34,878
Dr. Stone, do you copy?
- Yeah, Lieutenant Kowalski, yes.

246
00:17:34,979 --> 00:17:37,373
Yes, Lieutenant Kowalski, I'm
here, I'm here. - Repeat, do you copy?

247
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:40,795
Yes, yes, I copy, I'm here!
I'm here. - Flash your light.

248
00:17:41,065 --> 00:17:43,461
My light... my light?
- Flash it so I can see you.

249
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,350
Okay. Uh...

250
00:17:46,743 --> 00:17:47,887
I...

251
00:17:48,312 --> 00:17:50,901
Okay, okay. Here, here! I'm here!

252
00:17:51,002 --> 00:17:54,919
There you are. Hang on
tight. Report your status.

253
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:57,767
I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm all right.

254
00:17:57,867 --> 00:17:59,658
Your status. Give me your readings.

255
00:17:59,893 --> 00:18:06,035
Three... three... three point six PSI.
- Your O2, give me your O2.

256
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:10,704
Oxygen is going down. It's going down
fast. It's going down fast. Nine...

257
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,886
No. No, eight-eight percent.

258
00:18:12,887 --> 00:18:14,597
Okay, you're breathing too fast.
- Eight three point nine percent.

259
00:18:14,624 --> 00:18:17,158
You're burning oxygen, and
we don't want to do that.

260
00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:20,579
We want to relax. Copy?
- Okay, sorry. Yes, copy, copy.

261
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,454
All right. Nearly there.
- Please hurry.

262
00:18:24,473 --> 00:18:28,959
You can holster that torch, Dr. Stone.
- Sorry. Sorry.

263
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:37,503
Gotcha. All right, now
I'm gonna tether you to me.

264
00:18:39,681 --> 00:18:42,477
I know, you never realized how
devastatingly good-looking I am.

265
00:18:43,072 --> 00:18:46,623
But I need you to stop staring and
help me with the tether.

266
00:18:47,107 --> 00:18:49,936
Okay?
- Okay, okay.

267
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,486
I got it.

268
00:18:53,572 --> 00:18:56,211
All right, here we go. All right.

269
00:18:56,312 --> 00:18:58,783
Now, to clear you from the jets...
I'm gonna give you a little push.

270
00:18:59,003 --> 00:19:00,335
No, no, no, no. No, no, no.
- Not a push.

271
00:19:00,435 --> 00:19:01,799
No, no.
- A nudge.

272
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,677
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no! Damn it, no! No!

273
00:19:12,483 --> 00:19:14,665
See? Where you go, I go.

274
00:19:20,739 --> 00:19:21,799
Better.

275
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,303
Let's get outta here.

276
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,746
Goddamn it.
- I know what you mean.

277
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:32,499
Damn it.
- You're burning oxygen.

278
00:19:33,561 --> 00:19:37,196
We're going back to the shuttle.
How's that for a plan? Copy?

279
00:19:37,231 --> 00:19:39,890
Fuck!
- Right. Copy that.

280
00:19:40,981 --> 00:19:42,863
Houston, in the blind. This is Kowalski.

281
00:19:42,864 --> 00:19:44,819
Dr. Stone and I are gonna
make our way back to base.

282
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:48,183
Can you get the Explorer to prepare the
airlock for arrival? Copy?

283
00:19:49,674 --> 00:19:52,072
Houston, this is...
Kowalski. How do you copy?

284
00:19:53,078 --> 00:19:55,338
Houston, in the blind. This is Kowalski.

285
00:19:55,906 --> 00:19:57,629
They can't hear us.
- We don't know that.

286
00:19:57,731 --> 00:19:59,242
That's why we keep talking.

287
00:19:59,343 --> 00:20:01,917
If somebody is listening,
they might just save your life.

288
00:20:02,887 --> 00:20:06,545
Set your watch for ninety minutes.
- Why ninety?

289
00:20:06,646 --> 00:20:10,292
Well, Houston clocked that debris
at fifty thousand miles an hour.

290
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,232
If you factor in our current orbit,
then I figure we got about ninety minutes

291
00:20:13,332 --> 00:20:15,618
before we get our asses kicked again.

292
00:20:15,897 --> 00:20:19,646
O2 down to six percent.
- Okay.

293
00:20:19,747 --> 00:20:22,895
Pretty scary shit being
untethered up here, isn't it?

294
00:20:24,198 --> 00:20:28,516
Yeah, pretty scary shit.
- Well, you did all right.

295
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,671
Well, you weren't so bad yourself.

296
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,645
Houston, in the blind.
This is Kowalski.

297
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:45,104
Our current location is approximately
nine hundred meters out from the Explorer.

298
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,231
Dr. Stone and I would like to retrieve
the body of Mission Specialist Shariff

299
00:20:50,803 --> 00:20:53,943
and return it to the shuttle.
Am I a go to retrieve?

300
00:20:57,181 --> 00:21:00,135
Roger that.
- Where is he? Where is he?

301
00:21:28,345 --> 00:21:30,195
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

302
00:21:34,646 --> 00:21:35,891
Grab him!

303
00:21:39,106 --> 00:21:42,234
Grab him!
- I'm trying, I'm trying!

304
00:21:46,735 --> 00:21:48,818
You're pullin' me away.
- Got... I got him!

305
00:21:49,069 --> 00:21:51,109
Clutch him like he's your Valentine.
- I got him. Okay. I got him.

306
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,657
I can't engage my thrust with you
two yo-yoin' around.

307
00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:26,201
Jesus Christ.

308
00:22:26,901 --> 00:22:29,932
Here's hopin' you have a hell of
an insurance policy, Houston.

309
00:22:30,227 --> 00:22:36,722
The damages to Explorer are catastrophic.
Will commence search for survivors.

310
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:38,750
O2 down to five percent.

311
00:22:39,647 --> 00:22:41,640
All right, here we go.
Careful of the edges!

312
00:22:50,948 --> 00:22:52,183
Here. Here!

313
00:23:44,164 --> 00:23:45,710
Houston, in the blind. To confirm.

314
00:23:46,899 --> 00:23:50,590
Mission Specialist Dr. Stone and
Mission Commander Matthew Kowalski

315
00:23:50,591 --> 00:23:53,549
are the sole survivors
of the STS-one-five-seven.

316
00:23:56,576 --> 00:23:58,145
I apologize for not complying.

317
00:23:58,146 --> 00:24:00,423
I should've stopped working as
soon as you instructed me to.

318
00:24:00,424 --> 00:24:02,109
We were gonna get hit no matter what.

319
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,480
There was nothing you could
do to change that.

320
00:24:08,931 --> 00:24:10,961
Hey.
- Yes?

321
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:15,684
All right, we have to make our
way to the Space Station.

322
00:24:17,116 --> 00:24:18,628
Over there.

323
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,921
It's a bit of a hike, but we
need to use their escape pod,

324
00:24:22,922 --> 00:24:25,369
the Soyuz, to get back to Earth.

325
00:24:25,751 --> 00:24:27,253
Agreed?

326
00:24:28,404 --> 00:24:31,765
Dr. Stone, agreed?

327
00:24:33,037 --> 00:24:36,728
Agreed.
- All right. After you.

328
00:24:39,413 --> 00:24:40,414
Oh, God.

329
00:24:50,082 --> 00:24:52,323
Houston, in the blind.
This is Kowalski.

330
00:24:53,032 --> 00:24:56,235
Dr. Stone and I have
determined to proceed to ISS

331
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:59,378
and use one of their
Soyuz for re-entry.

332
00:25:00,434 --> 00:25:02,762
ISS, if you hear us...

333
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:05,463
we could sure use a rescue mission.

334
00:25:19,514 --> 00:25:23,332
O2 down to two percent.
- We're getting there.

335
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,562
Beautiful, don't you think?

336
00:25:28,137 --> 00:25:29,494
What?

337
00:25:29,715 --> 00:25:31,162
The sunrise.

338
00:25:32,853 --> 00:25:34,806
That's what I'm gonna miss the most.

339
00:25:40,098 --> 00:25:42,518
So where's home, Dr. Stone?

340
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:47,235
Ryan, where's home?

341
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,639
Home?

342
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:54,502
Down there. Mother Earth.

343
00:25:55,357 --> 00:25:57,073
Where do you pitch you tent?

344
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:03,461
Lake Zurich.
- Where the hell is that?

345
00:26:07,115 --> 00:26:09,423
Illinois.
- Illinois.

346
00:26:09,523 --> 00:26:11,236
Central Time Zone.

347
00:26:12,516 --> 00:26:14,143
That would make it roughly...

348
00:26:15,004 --> 00:26:16,519
eight PM.

349
00:26:16,763 --> 00:26:19,871
What are the good people of Lake
Zurich doing at eight o'clock?

350
00:26:21,357 --> 00:26:22,885
I don't know.

351
00:26:23,563 --> 00:26:27,668
I'm not gonna make it. I'm slowing
you down. - What would you be doing?

352
00:26:30,448 --> 00:26:33,677
Come on, Ryan. It's eight o'clock.

353
00:26:34,644 --> 00:26:37,909
You've just left the hospital
after an eighteen-hour shift.

354
00:26:38,567 --> 00:26:40,205
Driving home.

355
00:26:43,704 --> 00:26:44,953
The radio.

356
00:26:46,985 --> 00:26:50,534
I listen to the radio.
- There we go.

357
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,784
Let me guess.

358
00:26:51,884 --> 00:26:56,027
NPR? Classical? Top forty?

359
00:26:59,726 --> 00:27:03,280
Anything. I don't care, as long
as they don't talk. I just drive.

360
00:27:05,941 --> 00:27:07,493
And where are you driving to?

361
00:27:10,202 --> 00:27:14,330
I just drive.
- What do you miss down there?

362
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,089
Is there a Mr. Stone?

363
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:22,672
No.
- Nobody special?

364
00:27:25,788 --> 00:27:29,539
Somebody down there looking
up, thinking about you?

365
00:27:31,993 --> 00:27:33,472
Ryan?

366
00:27:40,797 --> 00:27:42,131
I had a daughter.

367
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,353
She was four.

368
00:27:57,099 --> 00:28:01,290
She was at school playing tag.
Slipped, hit her head, and that was it.

369
00:28:04,238 --> 00:28:06,284
Stupidest thing.

370
00:28:12,155 --> 00:28:15,234
I was driving when
I got the call, so...

371
00:28:16,108 --> 00:28:18,681
Ever since then, that's what I do.

372
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:25,619
I wake up, I go to
work, and I just drive.

373
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:55,257
O2 down to one percent.

374
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:09,533
Well, I've got good
news and bad news.

375
00:29:09,635 --> 00:29:12,107
The good news is, we're about
five minutes from the ISS

376
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:14,346
and I know where the
Russians stash their vodka.

377
00:29:14,656 --> 00:29:17,230
And that is good, because
I'm runnin' on fumes here.

378
00:29:18,433 --> 00:29:22,112
The bad news is, I'm gonna be about ten
minutes short of breakin' Anatoly's record,

379
00:29:22,113 --> 00:29:23,663
and I...

380
00:29:24,604 --> 00:29:26,695
What? - I'm redlining.

381
00:29:26,795 --> 00:29:29,148
My O2 tank pressure is low.

382
00:29:29,353 --> 00:29:32,674
Your tank is out of oxygen but you
still have it in your suit. - Got it.

383
00:29:32,709 --> 00:29:34,473
So you have to sip, not gulp.

384
00:29:35,426 --> 00:29:38,781
Wine, not beer.
Sip, Ryan.

385
00:29:39,584 --> 00:29:42,491
Houston, in the blind, we
have a visual of the ISS.

386
00:29:42,797 --> 00:29:46,376
The station must have been evacuated
because the first Soyuz is missing.

387
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:50,655
The second Soyuz exhibits surface
damage, and its chute has been deployed.

388
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:54,913
Any use as an escape pod
for re-entry is impossible.

389
00:29:55,665 --> 00:29:57,663
Shouldn't we be turning?
We're drifting again.

390
00:29:57,764 --> 00:30:00,347
Not yet. I wasn't
kidding about those fumes.

391
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:02,972
This can has one or
two good thrusts left...

392
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:04,597
if we're lucky.

393
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:18,456
Steady.

394
00:30:28,157 --> 00:30:29,387
Aim.

395
00:30:30,043 --> 00:30:31,182
Fire!

396
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:41,243
Brake! Brake! You have to brake!
- I can't, the can's empty.

397
00:30:41,445 --> 00:30:43,822
We're gonna hit hard! Grab
a hold of anything you can!

398
00:30:55,882 --> 00:30:58,971
What do I do? What do I do?!

399
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:10,699
Ryan!

400
00:31:14,561 --> 00:31:18,138
The tether broke, I'm detached!
I'm detached!

401
00:31:18,237 --> 00:31:19,663
Grab a hold!

402
00:31:22,026 --> 00:31:23,648
Grab anything!

403
00:31:39,796 --> 00:31:41,089
Ryan!

404
00:31:42,546 --> 00:31:44,965
Give me five!
- I've got you.

405
00:31:44,966 --> 00:31:48,302
I've got you. Right here, right here.

406
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:54,254
Shit!
- No. No, no, no...

407
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,038
Got ya.

408
00:32:06,302 --> 00:32:07,303
Got ya.

409
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,610
You just... hold on and I'm gonna
start pulling you in. I'm gonna start...

410
00:32:13,672 --> 00:32:16,906
Hey, Doc. - Just hold on. Hang
on. I am gonna pull you in.

411
00:32:17,165 --> 00:32:19,945
Ryan, listen. - I'm gonna pull
you in. - You have to let me go. - No.

412
00:32:20,045 --> 00:32:22,678
The ropes are too loose. I'm
pulling you with me.

413
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,957
You have to let me
go, or we both die.

414
00:32:25,057 --> 00:32:28,299
I'm not letting you go! We're fine!
- No.

415
00:32:33,929 --> 00:32:36,433
Ryan, let me go.
- No. No.

416
00:32:37,465 --> 00:32:39,672
You're not going anywhere.
You're not going anywhere.

417
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:43,490
It's not up to you. - No, no, no, no...
Please don't do this.

418
00:32:43,491 --> 00:32:48,320
Please, please, please, please don't do
this. Please don't do this. No, no, no.

419
00:32:48,929 --> 00:32:51,446
Please don't,
Matt. Please don't do this.

420
00:32:54,287 --> 00:32:55,835
You're gonna make it, Ryan.

421
00:32:57,315 --> 00:32:58,365
No!

422
00:33:19,976 --> 00:33:23,417
I had you. I had you! I had you.

423
00:33:39,135 --> 00:33:40,574
Ryan, do you hear me?

424
00:33:43,496 --> 00:33:47,353
Do you copy?
- My CO2 alarm went off.

425
00:33:47,454 --> 00:33:50,833
My CO2 alarm went off. - Look,
you need to board the station.

426
00:33:51,722 --> 00:33:53,362
Do you see the airlock?

427
00:34:02,631 --> 00:34:05,787
Hey, Ryan, you copy?

428
00:34:08,111 --> 00:34:09,727
Look for the
airlock.

429
00:34:12,314 --> 00:34:14,938
It's above you, next to
the Zarya module.

430
00:34:18,668 --> 00:34:21,118
You see it?
- Yes.

431
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:26,276
Yes, I see it. I see it. - Good.
That's where you want to go.

432
00:34:27,163 --> 00:34:29,273
Now you're getting
lightheaded, right?

433
00:34:29,365 --> 00:34:35,584
Yeah. Yes. - That's because you're
breathing CO2. You're losing consciousness.

434
00:34:35,924 --> 00:34:38,375
You need to board the station.
- Okay.

435
00:34:39,647 --> 00:34:42,239
That second Soyuz is
too damaged for re-entry,

436
00:34:42,451 --> 00:34:45,145
but it's perfectly fine
for a little Sunday drive.

437
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:47,153
Sunday drive?

438
00:34:47,557 --> 00:34:52,259
Look to the west. You see that
dot in the distance?

439
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:55,025
That's a Chinese station.
- Yes.

440
00:34:55,227 --> 00:34:57,571
You're gonna take the Soyuz, and
you're gonna cruise over there.

441
00:34:58,912 --> 00:35:02,066
Chinese lifeboat is a Shenzhou.

442
00:35:03,003 --> 00:35:05,565
I've never flown a Shenzhou.
- It doesn't matter.

443
00:35:05,878 --> 00:35:08,532
Its re-entry protocol is
identical to the Soyuz.

444
00:35:09,828 --> 00:35:11,360
Okay.

445
00:35:13,282 --> 00:35:17,469
You never flown the Soyuz either?
- Only a simulator.

446
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:23,680
Well, then you know.
- But I crashed it.

447
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:25,993
It's a simulator, that's
what it's designed for.

448
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:31,975
Every time. I crashed it every time.

449
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,534
You point the damn thing at Earth.

450
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:36,499
It's not rocket science.

451
00:35:37,032 --> 00:35:38,076
And by this time tomorrow,

452
00:35:38,077 --> 00:35:40,896
you're gonna be back in Lake Zurich
with a hell of a story to tell.

453
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,294
You copy?

454
00:35:45,003 --> 00:35:48,809
Ryan, you copy? - I'm gonna take
the Soyuz and come get you.

455
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:50,591
No, you're not.
- I'm coming to get you

456
00:35:50,838 --> 00:35:53,213
No, I've got too much of a head
start on you. - I'm coming to get you.

457
00:35:53,315 --> 00:35:55,539
I'm afraid that ship already sailed.

458
00:35:56,795 --> 00:35:59,287
Ryan, you're
gonna have to learn to let go.

459
00:36:00,481 --> 00:36:02,910
But I... - I want to hear you say
you're gonna make it...

460
00:36:05,064 --> 00:36:07,114
Come on, Ryan, say it.

461
00:36:08,816 --> 00:36:12,796
I'm gonna make it.
- All right. Keep going.

462
00:36:13,657 --> 00:36:16,623
What kind of name is Ryan for a girl?

463
00:36:18,155 --> 00:36:21,915
Dad wanted a boy.
- Are you close to the airlock?

464
00:36:23,187 --> 00:36:26,022
Not yet.
- Keep going.

465
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:29,118
So now that we have some
distance between us...

466
00:36:29,335 --> 00:36:32,446
you're attracted to me, right?
- What?

467
00:36:33,381 --> 00:36:36,428
Well, people say I have beautiful
blue eyes.

468
00:36:38,533 --> 00:36:43,858
You have beautiful...
You have beautiful blue eyes.

469
00:36:43,958 --> 00:36:45,644
I have brown eyes.

470
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:51,839
You want to know the good news?
- What?

471
00:36:52,056 --> 00:36:53,805
I'm gonna break Anatoly's record,

472
00:36:54,025 --> 00:36:56,324
and I think mine's gonna
stand for a long, long time.

473
00:36:56,424 --> 00:36:59,306
No. I'm coming to get you.

474
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:04,723
Oh, my God.
- What? What?

475
00:37:05,566 --> 00:37:07,006
Wow.

476
00:37:08,273 --> 00:37:11,020
Hey, Ryan?
- Yeah?

477
00:37:11,203 --> 00:37:13,858
You should see the sun on the Ganges.

478
00:37:16,246 --> 00:37:18,059
It's amazing.

479
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:45,434
Where are you? Where are you?

480
00:41:45,534 --> 00:41:48,825
Comms. Comms. There you are.

481
00:41:59,575 --> 00:42:01,542
Okay. Matt, this is Ryan, copy.

482
00:42:04,434 --> 00:42:06,853
Matt, this is Ryan, copy.

483
00:42:10,121 --> 00:42:13,559
Matt, I made it, I'm here, I'm
on the station. Do you copy?

484
00:42:20,035 --> 00:42:21,689
Come on, Matt, talk to me.

485
00:42:22,312 --> 00:42:24,764
Tell me where
you are, give me your position.

486
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:29,293
Where are you? Give me a visual.
Just tell me what you see.

487
00:42:34,104 --> 00:42:36,733
Come on. You've been yammering
since we left Cape Canaveral,

488
00:42:36,733 --> 00:42:38,135
and now you decide to shut up?

489
00:42:38,184 --> 00:42:42,145
Talk to me. Just say something,
say anything! I don't care!

490
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:54,348
Hey, tell me about, uh, Mardi Gras.
Tell me about the hairy guy. Huh?

491
00:42:54,721 --> 00:42:56,484
Tell me what happened.

492
00:42:56,585 --> 00:42:59,031
What happened to the hairy guy?

493
00:43:05,153 --> 00:43:07,243
Please talk to me.

494
00:43:11,027 --> 00:43:12,886
Please.

495
00:43:28,174 --> 00:43:29,688
Houston, in the blind...

496
00:43:32,304 --> 00:43:36,493
this is Mission Specialist Ryan
Stone reporting from the ISS.

497
00:43:38,442 --> 00:43:41,381
All communications with Mission
Commander Matthew Kowalski

498
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,023
have been lost.

499
00:43:46,054 --> 00:43:48,298
Radio transmission absent.

500
00:43:50,144 --> 00:43:52,278
Visuals nonexistent.

501
00:43:54,969 --> 00:43:59,931
To confirm, I, Ryan
Stone, am the sole survivor

502
00:44:00,357 --> 00:44:02,493
of STS-one-five-seven.

503
00:44:16,803 --> 00:44:18,804
What now?

504
00:45:54,163 --> 00:45:55,165
Okay.

505
00:45:58,146 --> 00:46:02,371
Okay. Where is it, where
is it? Where is the power?

506
00:46:05,841 --> 00:46:09,921
Great, just like training.
Undocking, undocking.

507
00:46:10,463 --> 00:46:14,220
Undocking. Red.

508
00:46:19,549 --> 00:46:21,502
Okay.

509
00:46:22,566 --> 00:46:26,213
Okay, where is it?
Where is it?

510
00:46:26,407 --> 00:46:27,407
Come on.

511
00:46:28,467 --> 00:46:29,469
Okay.

512
00:46:32,885 --> 00:46:35,210
Okay, I remember this,
I remember this.

513
00:46:50,334 --> 00:46:53,093
You don't have four minutes.
We're going manual.

514
00:46:53,892 --> 00:46:54,892
Come on.

515
00:46:57,487 --> 00:47:04,019
Okay. Active-Activate, undock.

516
00:47:29,032 --> 00:47:31,091
Seven minutes to get out of here.

517
00:47:37,798 --> 00:47:39,807
All right, okay.

518
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,162
What... what?

519
00:48:06,606 --> 00:48:08,835
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

520
00:48:38,003 --> 00:48:39,894
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

521
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:51,833
Come on, come on, come on!

522
00:48:52,103 --> 00:48:53,609
Come on!

523
00:48:53,611 --> 00:48:55,594
Come on, come on, come on!

524
00:48:56,527 --> 00:48:58,290
That's right, that's right.

525
00:48:58,822 --> 00:49:01,525
That's right, that's
right, that's right.

526
00:49:04,418 --> 00:49:05,520
Come on.

527
00:49:41,447 --> 00:49:42,449
Great.

528
00:50:28,544 --> 00:50:31,635
Clear skies with a chance of
satellite debris.

529
00:51:45,307 --> 00:51:48,302
Okay, we detach this, and we go
home. Piece of cake.

530
00:52:15,018 --> 00:52:16,417
Okay.

531
00:52:20,301 --> 00:52:22,007
Okay, what do we have?

532
00:52:22,549 --> 00:52:24,443
Okay, all right.

533
00:52:35,012 --> 00:52:36,357
Shit.

534
00:52:43,484 --> 00:52:45,517
Okay, come on.

535
00:52:45,616 --> 00:52:46,617
Come on, come on.

536
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:48,457
All right.

537
00:54:19,661 --> 00:54:21,221
I hate space.

538
00:54:41,262 --> 00:54:42,950
Shut up.

539
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:48,059
Okay.

540
00:54:56,450 --> 00:54:57,450
All right.

541
00:55:02,114 --> 00:55:03,329
That's good.

542
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,559
Okay.

543
00:55:07,746 --> 00:55:09,665
Let's stabilize you.

544
00:55:25,018 --> 00:55:26,289
Okay.

545
00:55:27,376 --> 00:55:30,126
Let's go visit the Chinese station.

546
00:55:31,062 --> 00:55:32,513
Houston, in the blind,

547
00:55:32,713 --> 00:55:38,348
Tiangong is approximately one
hundred kilometers to the west,

548
00:55:38,731 --> 00:55:45,709
and I am off its course by about thirteen
degrees. I will correct trajectory.

549
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:11,609
Okay. Okay.

550
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:13,267
Okay.

551
00:56:14,567 --> 00:56:18,573
I will engage S-Ka-Dae
in five... four...

552
00:56:18,863 --> 00:56:21,258
three... two... one.

553
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:38,302
What's happening, what's
happening? Come on, come on.

554
00:56:41,387 --> 00:56:42,562
One.

555
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:58,625
Come on, come on.

556
00:57:02,595 --> 00:57:04,770
You gotta be kidding me.

557
00:57:05,178 --> 00:57:06,846
You gotta be kidding me!

558
00:57:11,691 --> 00:57:13,482
No! Don't you fuck...

559
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:28,122
Houston, in the blind. Houston, in
the blind, this is Dr. Ryan Stone.

560
00:57:28,626 --> 00:57:32,615
I'm calling from the
Soyuz TMA-one-four-M.

561
00:57:33,091 --> 00:57:37,103
I'm currently out of fuel
and adrift, do you copy?

562
00:57:38,965 --> 00:57:42,725
Houston. This is Dr. Ryan Stone.

563
00:57:43,398 --> 00:57:44,400
Do you copy?

564
00:57:49,076 --> 00:57:53,614
Houston. This is
Ryan Stone. Do you copy?

565
00:57:57,008 --> 00:58:01,758
Houston, this is Missish... Mission
Specialist Ryan Stone, do you copy?

566
00:58:03,537 --> 00:58:06,392
Houston, Houston,
please confirm identity.

567
00:58:06,754 --> 00:58:10,269
Houston, you're coming in
over an A.M. frequency. Copy.

568
00:58:11,763 --> 00:58:12,764
Do you copy?

569
00:58:13,654 --> 00:58:16,948
Is this the Chinese station? Is
this Tiangong? Copy.

570
00:58:18,617 --> 00:58:23,147
Mayday, can you copy?
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

571
00:58:24,413 --> 00:58:29,040
Yes, yes. Mayday, mayday.
Mayday, mayday.

572
00:58:30,035 --> 00:58:32,274
Aningaaq.

573
00:58:34,986 --> 00:58:38,009
Is that...? Is that your...?
Is that your name?

574
00:58:38,011 --> 00:58:41,063
Aningaaq is your... is your
name? Is that your name?

575
00:58:42,828 --> 00:58:43,830
Mayday!

576
00:58:43,831 --> 00:58:46,807
No, no, no. No, my name
is not 'Mayday. ' I'm Stone.

577
00:58:46,808 --> 00:58:50,838
Dr. Ryan Stone, I need help. I am...

578
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:55,611
Those are dogs.

579
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:58,975
They're calling from Earth.

580
00:59:02,397 --> 00:59:04,217
They're calling from Earth.

581
00:59:16,771 --> 00:59:21,836
Aningaaq, make your dogs bark
again for me, would you please?

582
00:59:23,833 --> 00:59:28,384
Your dogs. Dogs, you
know. Woof, woof. Dogs.

583
01:00:13,297 --> 01:00:15,315
Oh, I'm gonna die, Aningaaq.

584
01:00:17,633 --> 01:00:21,281
I know, we're all gonna
die. Everybody knows that.

585
01:00:21,374 --> 01:00:23,615
But I'm gonna die today.

586
01:00:26,241 --> 01:00:29,412
Funny, that. You know, to know...

587
01:00:32,508 --> 01:00:35,391
But the thing is, it's
that I'm still scared.

588
01:00:36,083 --> 01:00:37,907
I'm really scared.

589
01:00:40,673 --> 01:00:43,280
Nobody will mourn for me,

590
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:44,657
no one will pray for my soul.

591
01:00:47,316 --> 01:00:49,215
Will you mourn for me?

592
01:00:50,698 --> 01:00:52,887
Will you say a prayer for me?

593
01:00:53,458 --> 01:00:55,148
Or is it too late?

594
01:00:59,587 --> 01:01:02,845
I mean, I'd say one for myself,
but I've never prayed in my life,

595
01:01:03,065 --> 01:01:04,110
so...

596
01:01:04,956 --> 01:01:06,892
Nobody ever taught me how.

597
01:01:10,934 --> 01:01:13,402
Nobody ever taught me how.

598
01:01:24,613 --> 01:01:25,994
A baby.

599
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:40,749
There's a baby with you, huh?

600
01:01:43,611 --> 01:01:45,766
Is that a lullaby you're singing?

601
01:01:48,712 --> 01:01:50,513
That's so sweet.

602
01:01:52,696 --> 01:01:54,883
I used to sing to my baby.

603
01:01:58,738 --> 01:02:00,881
I hope I see her soon.

604
01:03:11,295 --> 01:03:14,355
That's nice, Aningaaq. Keep
singing, just like that.

605
01:03:16,327 --> 01:03:18,836
Sing me to sleep, and I'll sleep.

606
01:03:20,476 --> 01:03:24,575
Keep singing. And sing, and sing.

607
01:03:54,041 --> 01:03:55,922
No, no, no, don't!

608
01:04:38,959 --> 01:04:41,004
Check your watch. Thirteen
hours and eleven minutes.

609
01:04:41,319 --> 01:04:44,257
Call Anatoly and tell
him he's been bumped.

610
01:04:44,986 --> 01:04:46,525
It's a little gloomy in here, isn't it?
- How did you...?

611
01:04:47,227 --> 01:04:49,776
Trust me, it's a hell of a story.
- But how did...?

612
01:04:52,518 --> 01:04:54,122
That's better.

613
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:58,093
I found a little extra...
a little extra battery power.

614
01:04:58,359 --> 01:05:00,619
It helps that I didn't
have you around to distract me.

615
01:05:01,009 --> 01:05:05,010
I have to say, I'm glad to see ya. I
didn't think you were gonna make it.

616
01:05:05,504 --> 01:05:08,155
Did you find the vodka?
- You...

617
01:05:08,989 --> 01:05:11,782
You never told me where...
where it was, so... - Well...

618
01:05:17,633 --> 01:05:20,970
To Anatoly. Na zdorovje.

619
01:05:26,084 --> 01:05:30,694
Huh? - No. - No? All right.
Let's get out of here.

620
01:05:32,796 --> 01:05:37,289
The Chinese station's about a hundred
miles. Just a little Sunday drive.

621
01:05:37,634 --> 01:05:39,070
We can't.
- Sure we can.

622
01:05:39,735 --> 01:05:40,763
There's no fuel, I tried everything.

623
01:05:41,084 --> 01:05:44,147
Well, there's always something
we can do. - I tried everything.

624
01:05:44,247 --> 01:05:46,392
Did you try the soft landing jets?

625
01:05:46,492 --> 01:05:48,688
They're for landing. So...
- Well, landing is launching.

626
01:05:48,789 --> 01:05:51,020
It's the same thing. Didn't you
learn about that in training?

627
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:53,077
I never got to land the simulator.
I told you that.

628
01:05:53,310 --> 01:05:55,857
But you know about it.
- And I crashed it every time.

629
01:05:55,957 --> 01:05:58,245
Listen, do you want to go back,
or do you want to stay here?

630
01:06:01,465 --> 01:06:03,289
I get it, it's nice up here.

631
01:06:06,482 --> 01:06:10,286
You can just shut
down all the systems,

632
01:06:11,472 --> 01:06:13,476
turn out all the lights...

633
01:06:14,298 --> 01:06:16,891
and just close your eyes
and tune out everybody.

634
01:06:17,783 --> 01:06:19,707
There's nobody up
here that can hurt you.

635
01:06:20,217 --> 01:06:21,578
It's safe.

636
01:06:25,121 --> 01:06:27,981
I mean, what's the point of going
on? What's the point of living?

637
01:06:32,541 --> 01:06:36,382
Your kid died. Doesn't
get any rougher than that.

638
01:06:38,928 --> 01:06:41,491
But still, it's a matter of what
you do now.

639
01:06:42,846 --> 01:06:46,129
If you decide to go, then
you gotta just get on with it.

640
01:06:46,972 --> 01:06:49,394
Sit back, enjoy the ride.

641
01:06:50,033 --> 01:06:53,798
You gotta plant both your feet on
the ground and start livin' life.

642
01:06:53,898 --> 01:06:57,654
How did you get here?
- I'm telling you, it's a hell of a story.

643
01:06:58,103 --> 01:07:00,591
Hey, Ryan?
- What?

644
01:07:00,806 --> 01:07:03,231
It's time to go home.

645
01:07:46,620 --> 01:07:47,869
Landing...

646
01:07:50,092 --> 01:07:54,357
Landing... Landing is launching.

647
01:07:54,945 --> 01:07:56,335
I said...

648
01:08:10,207 --> 01:08:13,117
Okay, landing, landing.
Landing is green.

649
01:08:24,051 --> 01:08:25,204
Okay.

650
01:08:27,003 --> 01:08:30,676
Okay, landing. All right.

651
01:08:31,326 --> 01:08:36,141
Okay. Soft landing jets trigger automatically
at three meters before landing, so...

652
01:08:39,066 --> 01:08:41,330
You're a clever son of a
bitch, Matt.

653
01:08:41,664 --> 01:08:47,648
I need to... I need to get rid of
the B.O... and the engine module.

654
01:08:48,984 --> 01:08:50,391
Right. Okay.

655
01:08:51,107 --> 01:08:52,391
Okay.

656
01:08:54,092 --> 01:08:55,451
Okay.

657
01:08:58,249 --> 01:08:59,855
Tri-module separation.

658
01:09:01,112 --> 01:09:02,113
Go.

659
01:09:16,690 --> 01:09:17,973
Okay.

660
01:09:18,875 --> 01:09:20,860
Houston, here's the tricky part.

661
01:09:21,515 --> 01:09:23,637
Soyuz has to think

662
01:09:23,837 --> 01:09:27,347
we are three meters off the Earth.

663
01:09:28,248 --> 01:09:30,853
All right. Okay.

664
01:09:31,247 --> 01:09:36,616
Hey, Matt? Since I had to listen to endless
hours of your storytelling this week,

665
01:09:37,119 --> 01:09:38,932
I need for you to do me a favor.

666
01:09:40,198 --> 01:09:45,505
You are gonna see a little girl with
brown hair, very messy, lots of knots.

667
01:09:46,177 --> 01:09:49,490
She doesn't like to
brush it. That's okay.

668
01:09:50,534 --> 01:09:51,812
Her name is Sarah.

669
01:09:52,890 --> 01:09:54,579
Can you please tell her

670
01:09:55,624 --> 01:09:57,891
that Mama found her red shoe?

671
01:09:59,075 --> 01:10:01,166
She was so worried
about that shoe, Matt.

672
01:10:02,055 --> 01:10:03,792
But it was just right under the bed.

673
01:10:07,533 --> 01:10:09,927
Give her a big hug
and a big kiss for me,

674
01:10:10,028 --> 01:10:11,901
and tell her that Mama misses her.

675
01:10:13,276 --> 01:10:15,141
You tell her that she is my angel.

676
01:10:16,109 --> 01:10:19,682
And she makes me so
proud. So, so proud.

677
01:10:24,516 --> 01:10:26,392
And you tell her
that I'm not quitting.

678
01:10:33,978 --> 01:10:35,797
You tell her that I love her, Matt.

679
01:10:36,996 --> 01:10:39,305
You tell her that I love her so much.

680
01:10:42,087 --> 01:10:43,653
Can you do that for me?

681
01:10:46,225 --> 01:10:47,882
Roger that?

682
01:10:50,283 --> 01:10:51,657
Here we go.

683
01:11:27,981 --> 01:11:30,105
You're losing altitude, Tiangong.

684
01:11:33,356 --> 01:11:36,824
You keep dropping and you're gonna
kiss the atmosphere.

685
01:11:37,525 --> 01:11:40,633
But not without me,
because you're my last ride.

686
01:11:41,978 --> 01:11:43,445
Okay.

687
01:11:44,319 --> 01:11:45,820
Wait.

688
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:53,986
Five...

689
01:11:55,201 --> 01:11:56,312
four...

690
01:11:57,504 --> 01:11:58,562
three...

691
01:11:59,782 --> 01:12:01,464
No more just driving.

692
01:12:03,230 --> 01:12:04,889
Let's go home.

693
01:12:09,682 --> 01:12:12,762
Steady. Okay, come on, come on.

694
01:12:13,896 --> 01:12:14,897
Steady, steady.

695
01:12:16,192 --> 01:12:17,990
Come on. Come on.

696
01:12:22,101 --> 01:12:23,703
Where are you? Where
are you? Forty-five,

697
01:12:24,377 --> 01:12:27,189
ninety, one-eighty.

698
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:35,517
Come on.

699
01:12:44,581 --> 01:12:46,054
Okay, okay.

700
01:12:47,939 --> 01:12:49,684
Okay.

701
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:02,702
All right.

702
01:13:03,687 --> 01:13:05,190
Damn it.

703
01:13:06,594 --> 01:13:10,807
Down, down, down.
Come to Mama.

704
01:14:24,099 --> 01:14:25,498
Okay.

705
01:14:31,909 --> 01:14:34,130
Okay. Shit!

706
01:14:40,821 --> 01:14:41,821
Okay.

707
01:14:43,815 --> 01:14:47,304
Come on. Shenzhou, come
on. Shenzhou. Shenzhou.

708
01:14:48,358 --> 01:14:52,560
Fuck! Okay, this way. Shenzhou.

709
01:14:59,897 --> 01:15:03,129
Where are you? Come on,
where are you? What's this?

710
01:15:50,634 --> 01:15:54,055
In the Soyuz, the
power button is here.

711
01:15:57,461 --> 01:16:00,616
Okay, undocking,
undocking.

712
01:16:01,669 --> 01:16:03,593
Eeni, meeni...

713
01:16:03,595 --> 01:16:08,222
Okay, that doesn't sound
good. Miny, meeni... moe.

714
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:11,672
No hablo chino.

715
01:16:12,988 --> 01:16:15,152
Miny... moe.

716
01:16:17,054 --> 01:16:19,457
Okay. Okay, good.

717
01:16:27,787 --> 01:16:29,726
Houston. Houston, in the blind.

718
01:16:30,053 --> 01:16:31,978
This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone

719
01:16:32,349 --> 01:16:33,941
reporting from the Shenzhou.

720
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:36,083
I'm about to undock from Tiangong...

721
01:16:40,896 --> 01:16:43,544
And I have a bad
feeling about this mission.

722
01:16:45,889 --> 01:16:47,933
Reminds me of a story, Houston...

723
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:54,519
Never... Never mind the story,
Houston. Never mind the story.

724
01:16:57,048 --> 01:17:00,203
It's getting hot in here. Okay.
All right.

725
01:17:01,195 --> 01:17:02,195
Okay.

726
01:17:02,969 --> 01:17:06,969
All right, the way I see it,
there's only two possible outcomes.

727
01:17:07,216 --> 01:17:11,743
Either I make it down there in one piece
and I have one hell of a story to tell,

728
01:17:12,466 --> 01:17:14,933
or I burn up in the next ten minutes.

729
01:17:16,429 --> 01:17:20,771
Either way, whichever
way... no harm, no foul!

730
01:17:28,298 --> 01:17:29,802
Because either way...

731
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:34,497
it'll be one hell of a ride.

732
01:17:36,965 --> 01:17:38,610
I'm ready.

733
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:49,906
Shenzhou, in the blind, this is
Houston. Indicate FM frequency.

734
01:19:51,392 --> 01:19:54,018
Our radars detect you
on a re-entry trajectory.

735
01:19:54,054 --> 01:19:56,462
If you copy, please confirm identity.

736
01:20:17,345 --> 01:20:22,441
This is Houston.
- It's freezing, it's boring as hell.

737
01:20:23,041 --> 01:20:25,077
...is: No money down!

738
01:20:25,077 --> 01:20:29,165
...messages, we'll be right...
- Please confirm identity.

739
01:20:29,166 --> 01:20:30,168
Skies over the Midwest
are completely clear...

740
01:20:30,169 --> 01:20:33,498
We've deployed a rescue
mission to retrieve you.

741
01:20:33,755 --> 01:20:35,898
Rescue mission is on the way.

742
01:20:39,735 --> 01:20:41,203
Shenzhou, in the blind, this is Houston.

743
01:20:41,204 --> 01:20:43,874
We've deployed a rescue
mission to retrieve you.

744
01:23:38,121 --> 01:23:39,510
Thank you.
