Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese

2
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,797
There either is or is not
a way things are.

3
00:02:33,042 --> 00:02:36,795
The color of the day.
How it felt to be a child.

4
00:02:37,045 --> 00:02:41,465
The feeling of saltwater
on your sunburned legs.

5
00:02:41,717 --> 00:02:45,595
Sometimes the water is yellow.
Sometimes it's red.

6
00:02:45,845 --> 00:02:51,517
The color in memory
depends on the day.

7
00:02:51,768 --> 00:02:55,771
I won't tell the story
the way it happened.

8
00:02:56,022 --> 00:03:00,693
I'll tell it the
way I remember it.

9
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:02,336
Help! Help!

10
00:04:14,557 --> 00:04:15,599
What's your name?

11
00:04:17,059 --> 00:04:20,854
- Whisper. What's your name? Whisper!
- Finn.

12
00:04:21,105 --> 00:04:22,773
- What's your last name?
- Bell.

13
00:04:23,023 --> 00:04:25,191
- Where do you live?
- By the pier.

14
00:04:25,442 --> 00:04:28,194
Do you have tools?

15
00:04:28,403 --> 00:04:32,990
Do you know what bolt cutters are?
Do you or don't you?

16
00:04:33,241 --> 00:04:36,619
I can find you
and gut you like a fish.

17
00:04:36,871 --> 00:04:40,916
I'll pull out your insides
and make you eat them, hear me?

18
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:46,921
Be here tomorrow at dawn with bolt
cutters and food, or I'll kill you.

19
00:04:47,172 --> 00:04:49,173
I'll kill you if you tell.

20
00:04:49,424 --> 00:04:54,261
- Anyone! Your folks...
- They're dead.

21
00:04:54,512 --> 00:05:01,560
If you tell anyone, the last sound
you hear will be your own scream. Go!

22
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,691
Finn!

23
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:52,735
- Oh, it's you, Joe.
- Did I scare you?

24
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:56,489
- So you went out today?
- Yeah! I got a nice tan.

25
00:05:56,739 --> 00:06:00,826
No fish.
Setting traps, like everybody.

26
00:06:01,078 --> 00:06:05,790
- Where's the fire?
- Nowhere. Just got homework.

27
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:11,587
Maggie's on a kind of rant today,
so you be careful, okay?

28
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,382
- Are you coming home soon?
- In an hour.

29
00:06:14,632 --> 00:06:18,218
If you finish your work,
we'll go to Carvel's.

30
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:22,806
You rest up. We've got
a gardening job tomorrow.

31
00:06:23,057 --> 00:06:26,351
- Joe?
- Yeah?

32
00:06:27,061 --> 00:06:30,564
Nothing.

33
00:06:30,856 --> 00:06:34,651
Hey, Finn!
How do you smoke a swordfish?

34
00:06:34,902 --> 00:06:37,487
Put the bill in your mouth
and light the tail.

35
00:06:37,738 --> 00:06:41,366
I'll see you later.

36
00:06:42,326 --> 00:06:47,497
I was raised with some
freedom from my sister, Maggie.

37
00:06:47,748 --> 00:06:50,333
Joe was her man.

38
00:06:50,584 --> 00:06:55,296
They banned big fishing rigs
that year, and we were poor.

39
00:06:55,547 --> 00:07:00,927
We got by on what Joe earned
on charters and lawn work.

40
00:08:33,392 --> 00:08:34,684
Hey.

41
00:08:34,935 --> 00:08:37,312
Hey.

42
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,034
Come on, come here.
Come on!

43
00:08:55,915 --> 00:08:59,251
Are you alone?

44
00:08:59,501 --> 00:09:01,502
- You deaf? Are you alone?
- No.

45
00:09:01,754 --> 00:09:06,258
You're not alone
or you're not deaf?

46
00:09:21,231 --> 00:09:24,692
Here, I brought you
something to drink.

47
00:09:24,943 --> 00:09:28,029
Attaboy!

48
00:09:56,432 --> 00:09:59,476
Here, I took this for you.

49
00:09:59,726 --> 00:10:02,603
What's this?
Birth control pills?

50
00:10:02,855 --> 00:10:07,192
Here, this too.

51
00:10:07,276 --> 00:10:11,780
Percodan.
Attaboy, now you're talking.

52
00:10:16,744 --> 00:10:22,833
What else?
Come on, come on, come on!

53
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:35,052
Do you bite your nails?

54
00:10:35,303 --> 00:10:37,304
That's a bad habit.

55
00:10:37,555 --> 00:10:43,310
People say the eyes
are the windows to the soul. Bullshit.

56
00:10:43,562 --> 00:10:49,150
Hands. That's the sign of a gentleman.

57
00:10:51,111 --> 00:10:55,656
Come on, let's go. Come on.

58
00:10:56,449 --> 00:10:59,576
- What?
- Come on.

59
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:02,162
- In the boat.
- If I don't get home...

60
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:08,377
Fuck your uncle, get in the boat.
Pick up the anchor. Let's go.

61
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:15,884
Shut up and get in the boat.

62
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:20,471
- Where are we going?
- Mexico.

63
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:08,310
- What?
- Police boat.

64
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:12,231
Stop!

65
00:12:36,421 --> 00:12:40,007
Ahoy there!
Son, are you all right?

66
00:12:40,258 --> 00:12:42,676
- Where are you headed?
- Nowhere.

67
00:12:42,927 --> 00:12:46,889
Some lady thought she saw a raft
here yesterday.

68
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:53,230
A man on it wearing a prison suit.
Did you see anything like that?

69
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:59,568
- No.
- Tie up a line. We'll tow you in.

70
00:13:24,426 --> 00:13:26,886
That was the end of it.

71
00:13:27,138 --> 00:13:32,601
Perhaps you had an experience
like that as a child and told no one.

72
00:13:32,852 --> 00:13:36,605
Perhaps you had a brush with
a world so large you seldom...

73
00:13:36,856 --> 00:13:40,025
... or never saw it again.

74
00:14:12,182 --> 00:14:19,272
Jesus! It's the land time forgot.
Nora Driggers Dinsmoor.

75
00:14:34,828 --> 00:14:38,539
Wait here. I'll find out
what they want us to do.

76
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:46,088
- Is it all right if I look around?
- No! You stay put till I come back.

77
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:50,467
God knows what's in these weeds.

78
00:15:10,405 --> 00:15:13,908
Nora Driggers Dinsmoor,
richest lady in the gulf.

79
00:15:14,158 --> 00:15:17,828
She lost her mind 30 years ago
when her fiancé left her...

80
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,206
... at the altar.

81
00:15:49,193 --> 00:15:52,446
What's your name?

82
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:09,337
Finn.

83
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,405
Hey, Finn!

84
00:16:41,035 --> 00:16:44,997
We're out of here. She slipped me
$500 under the door.

85
00:16:45,247 --> 00:16:48,708
Gas money, she called it.
Weirdest thing.

86
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,878
- What?
- Nothing. Can I ride with you?

87
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,799
You smell like fertilizer.

88
00:16:55,049 --> 00:16:59,386
Really? I do?

89
00:17:04,058 --> 00:17:05,559
Mag!

90
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:09,520
- You've got the wrong number.
- You won't believe...

91
00:17:09,771 --> 00:17:15,109
Yes, well, he just...
Did he do something bad?

92
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,781
I'll be glad to.
That sounds really...

93
00:17:21,282 --> 00:17:24,118
You got it. Okay.

94
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:29,540
Three on Saturday. This Saturday?
And thank you so much, ma'am.

95
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:33,043
You won't believe
where we were today.

96
00:17:33,295 --> 00:17:36,631
That was Nora Driggers Dinsmoor.

97
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:40,008
It was too good to be true.
She wants her money back?

98
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,512
She wants him. Finn!

99
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:46,598
The richest lady
in the state calls me...

100
00:17:46,849 --> 00:17:49,851
...and wants my little brother
to play with her niece.

101
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:55,440
"Why"? The old bat liked you.
He's a likable kid, he's adorable.

102
00:17:55,691 --> 00:18:00,612
Who cares? Joe, this is
a really good thing.

103
00:18:00,863 --> 00:18:04,449
How'd she even know...?
Dinsmoor never met Finn.

104
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,536
She slipped this under the door.

105
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:10,747
What is it, Joe? God!

106
00:18:10,997 --> 00:18:16,335
Do you like living with all
the dead people down here?

107
00:18:16,587 --> 00:18:23,093
What's wrong with people here?
I'm tired of working so much.

108
00:18:23,343 --> 00:18:27,346
They took away the nets.

109
00:18:27,681 --> 00:18:32,810
Convict Arthur Lustig
was recaptured this evening.

110
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:35,938
This concludes
a four-day manhunt for Lustig...

111
00:18:36,189 --> 00:18:38,733
... the convicted murderer
of Gene Valiente.

112
00:18:38,983 --> 00:18:42,903
Valiente, reputed mob boss
of the Catalano family...

113
00:18:43,154 --> 00:18:46,532
... was gunned down in his home
last Christmas.

114
00:18:46,782 --> 00:18:49,993
Lustig will be returned
to death row...

115
00:18:50,244 --> 00:18:57,375
... and is scheduled to die
by lethal injection March 16th.

116
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:09,638
Holy shit!

117
00:19:10,139 --> 00:19:13,392
Hey, you look sharp.

118
00:19:13,642 --> 00:19:19,689
- How do I smell?
- You smell clean. Tea time.

119
00:19:20,023 --> 00:19:23,943
- Be polite. "Yes, ma'am", "No, ma'am".
- I will.

120
00:19:24,194 --> 00:19:28,739
- Are you okay with this?
- He's great. Go ahead.

121
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:32,553
Say, "May I", "Please",
all that stuff.

122
00:19:43,588 --> 00:19:47,383
Oh, the gardener.

123
00:19:51,221 --> 00:19:57,476
The design of this floor is
from the Alhambra in Spain.

124
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,814
The ceiling's gold leaf, real gold.

125
00:20:03,065 --> 00:20:07,569
It's just like the Thousand
Wing ceiling at Venice's Accademia.

126
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:10,989
Old Ms. Dinsmoor
hadn't been seen in years.

127
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,116
I'd heard she was crazy.

128
00:20:13,367 --> 00:20:14,826
Go ahead.

129
00:20:15,078 --> 00:20:17,914
Aren't you coming?

130
00:20:18,164 --> 00:20:22,459
But nobody knew how crazy.

131
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:28,173
Her room smelled of dead
flowers and cat piss.

132
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:44,355
Boom boom.

133
00:20:56,284 --> 00:20:57,076
Chicka-boom!

134
00:20:57,327 --> 00:21:03,207
Besame, besame mucho

135
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:10,672
Each time I cling to your kiss
I hear music divine

136
00:21:15,386 --> 00:21:21,141
Hold me my darling and say
that you'll always be mine

137
00:21:21,183 --> 00:21:24,644
This joy's something new, my arms
they're holding you

138
00:21:24,895 --> 00:21:27,313
I never knew this thrill before

139
00:21:27,564 --> 00:21:32,527
Whoever thought I'd be holding you
close, whispering...

140
00:21:32,777 --> 00:21:36,530
- Who are you?
- Finn, ma'am.

141
00:21:36,782 --> 00:21:42,328
- What are you doing in my bedroom?
- I don't know.

142
00:21:42,413 --> 00:21:46,416
Give me your hand.

143
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:52,213
- What is this?
- Your... Your boob.

144
00:21:52,464 --> 00:21:58,136
My heart. It's my heart. It's broken.

145
00:21:58,386 --> 00:22:03,766
- Can you tell?
- I'm sorry.

146
00:22:05,143 --> 00:22:07,561
"Sorry." Come.

147
00:22:07,812 --> 00:22:10,773
Shoo, shoo. Tabby, scram.

148
00:22:11,023 --> 00:22:14,859
Wow! That's the biggest cat
I've ever seen.

149
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:20,281
- What do you feed it?
- Other cats.

150
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:26,997
Well, go ahead.
You can proceed.

151
00:22:31,877 --> 00:22:34,045
- Dance.
- Huh?

152
00:22:34,296 --> 00:22:39,801
I'd like you to dance. That's why
you're here. To entertain me.

153
00:22:40,052 --> 00:22:44,764
Pony, foxtrot, frug,
Philly Dog, fandango. Anything.

154
00:22:45,015 --> 00:22:49,227
I can't. I'm sorry, ma'am.

155
00:22:49,477 --> 00:22:53,564
You "can't"? "I'm sorry, ma'am."

156
00:22:53,815 --> 00:22:58,402
Or you won't? You dance.
Dance, dance, dance!

157
00:23:00,989 --> 00:23:05,243
- Get out of here.
- Wait!

158
00:23:05,494 --> 00:23:08,330
I can draw.

159
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:16,796
You can use my lipstick and eyebrow
pencil on the dressing table.

160
00:23:19,924 --> 00:23:22,718
Estella!

161
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:26,514
Estella?

162
00:23:37,607 --> 00:23:41,443
- Is tea ready?
- I'd like you to sit for a portrait.

163
00:23:41,696 --> 00:23:46,659
- A portrait? By whom?
- That boy.

164
00:23:46,909 --> 00:23:50,120
The gardener?
I'll be in my room.

165
00:23:50,371 --> 00:23:53,081
Come back and sit.

166
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:56,418
Please.

167
00:23:56,543 --> 00:24:01,339
And you. Come sit by me.

168
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:21,149
She's beautiful, isn't she?

169
00:24:27,282 --> 00:24:33,204
What do you think of her?
Come on, whisper in my ear.

170
00:24:33,454 --> 00:24:37,416
Come on.

171
00:24:39,543 --> 00:24:43,129
I think she's a snob.

172
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,257
Anything else?

173
00:24:49,386 --> 00:24:53,306
I think she's real pretty.

174
00:24:53,557 --> 00:24:57,602
Anything else?

175
00:25:01,649 --> 00:25:05,110
I think she doesn't like me.

176
00:25:05,361 --> 00:25:10,198
But you love her.
She'll break your heart, it's a fact.

177
00:25:10,449 --> 00:25:15,578
It's tragic, you're already in love.
And though I guarantee you...

178
00:25:15,829 --> 00:25:22,835
...that the girl will hurt you
terribly, you'll still pursue her.

179
00:25:23,336 --> 00:25:27,381
Ain't love grand?

180
00:25:45,817 --> 00:25:49,612
- I'd like to go now.
- Have you finished?

181
00:25:49,862 --> 00:25:52,114
Before I'm a teenager, please.

182
00:25:52,365 --> 00:25:56,243
Can I go now?

183
00:25:59,163 --> 00:26:05,627
Would you like to come again?
Would you like to see Estella again?

184
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,880
Yes.

185
00:26:09,131 --> 00:26:13,635
Poor boy, poor boy, poor boy.
This is yours, dear.

186
00:26:13,885 --> 00:26:19,056
The ways of the rich and all my
longing, which began that day.

187
00:26:19,307 --> 00:26:24,853
To paint for the rich, to have
their freedom, to love Estella.

188
00:26:25,105 --> 00:26:28,274
The things we cannot have.

189
00:26:28,525 --> 00:26:31,652
Give this to your guardian.

190
00:26:31,903 --> 00:26:35,739
Would you see Finn out, please?

191
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:45,165
Chicka-boom!

192
00:27:10,024 --> 00:27:12,234
Want some?

193
00:27:12,484 --> 00:27:15,445
It's not poisoned.

194
00:28:06,203 --> 00:28:12,208
You remember it.
You remember how it felt.

195
00:28:12,251 --> 00:28:16,755
And then I went home to draw it.

196
00:28:25,681 --> 00:28:29,851
I'm going to work.
What are you going to do before bed?

197
00:28:30,102 --> 00:28:32,229
Brush my teeth.

198
00:28:32,479 --> 00:28:37,275
That's really beautiful, Finn.

199
00:28:39,861 --> 00:28:43,030
Keep it up, okay?

200
00:28:43,281 --> 00:28:47,159
Maggie left that night.
She never came back.

201
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:51,246
I'll see you when you wake up.

202
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:58,712
Joe raised me.
We never said a word.

203
00:28:59,755 --> 00:29:03,133
I visited Paradiso Perduto
Saturdays.

204
00:29:03,384 --> 00:29:06,595
Feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it.

205
00:29:06,846 --> 00:29:10,682
The money Dinsmoor paid
kept me in paints and brushes.

206
00:29:10,933 --> 00:29:12,934
And there was Estella.

207
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:26,823
Smile. Smile.

208
00:29:27,074 --> 00:29:31,328
Smi... All right, don't smile.

209
00:29:32,287 --> 00:29:35,414
Yes, feel it!

210
00:29:39,294 --> 00:29:44,674
Wonderful, wonderful!
Feel it in your bones.

211
00:30:01,983 --> 00:30:05,361
- Where are you going?
- Cocktails at Rewald's.

212
00:30:05,611 --> 00:30:08,989
Lane? Another cocktail,
and we'll be able to eat him.

213
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,034
Carl Rewald. Lane is his father.
Carl doesn't drink.

214
00:30:12,284 --> 00:30:16,496
Cue balls. The whole family's pickled.
Who's your escort?

215
00:30:16,747 --> 00:30:21,501
- Please, this is the '80s...
- I'll bring you.

216
00:30:27,842 --> 00:30:31,845
Finn will make a fine date.

217
00:30:31,971 --> 00:30:34,181
Oh, God!

218
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:37,017
Then it's done.

219
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:43,941
Fine, but you meet me there. 1115
North Ocean. Wear your dinner jacket.

220
00:30:44,191 --> 00:30:48,987
- How much time have you got?
- None, I'm late! I'm dead. Wow!

221
00:30:49,237 --> 00:30:54,241
That'll pass as a dinner jacket.

222
00:30:54,951 --> 00:30:58,913
- This is a girl's.
- Keep it buttoned, no one will notice.

223
00:30:59,163 --> 00:31:02,332
- Where did you get this?
- It's Maggie's.

224
00:31:02,583 --> 00:31:06,878
- It's one of the only things she left.
- What a bitch!

225
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:10,007
What?

226
00:31:10,258 --> 00:31:14,929
- "What?" Come here.
- Jesus!

227
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:19,350
- Are you all right for money?
- Yeah, I'm good.

228
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,980
- A little nervous?
- Yeah, a little.

229
00:31:27,191 --> 00:31:30,610
There you go.

230
00:31:30,861 --> 00:31:34,989
You just be yourself, huh?

231
00:31:35,157 --> 00:31:37,617
Come on, have fun.

232
00:31:37,868 --> 00:31:42,455
- You're not on the list.
- Check the name Dinsmoor?

233
00:31:42,706 --> 00:31:47,752
I did, sir. You're not on this list.
Please leave now.

234
00:31:48,003 --> 00:31:54,384
Hi, Mrs. Lee!
Use your usual spot.

235
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:00,974
Hi.

236
00:32:01,224 --> 00:32:05,144
- Do you want to get me out of here?
- Yes.

237
00:32:05,395 --> 00:32:08,481
Come on in.

238
00:32:08,898 --> 00:32:13,277
- Where do you want to go?
- Your house?

239
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:19,449
All right. Let's go.

240
00:32:24,788 --> 00:32:32,587
The moths are
from the Thousand Wing ceiling.

241
00:32:34,966 --> 00:32:40,804
Joe's not here. He's...
He's playing dominoes.

242
00:32:41,055 --> 00:32:45,559
- Is that your room?
- Yeah.

243
00:32:47,686 --> 00:32:51,397
I wasn't really
expecting company...

244
00:32:51,648 --> 00:32:54,901
...you know.

245
00:33:01,866 --> 00:33:05,577
- You still draw.
- Yeah.

246
00:33:05,828 --> 00:33:08,914
They're hanging a couple
at Washington Federal.

247
00:33:09,165 --> 00:33:12,710
The bank?

248
00:33:12,753 --> 00:33:15,505
- Go to New York.
- New York?

249
00:33:15,756 --> 00:33:17,549
Center of the art world.

250
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:23,929
Here, you'll end up painting
coconuts for tourists.

251
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,191
- When did you do this?
- A while ago.

252
00:33:37,651 --> 00:33:40,737
I don't wear my hair like that
anymore.

253
00:33:40,988 --> 00:33:43,949
But you should.

254
00:33:44,324 --> 00:33:48,619
- I mean...
- Do you like it that way?

255
00:34:06,263 --> 00:34:09,724
What else do you like?

256
00:34:13,854 --> 00:34:19,442
How come we see each other
every week, but we never did anything?

257
00:34:19,692 --> 00:34:24,029
- "Did anything"?
- Saw a movie, whatever.

258
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,282
You never asked.

259
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:30,786
And if I had?

260
00:34:34,708 --> 00:34:38,294
I'm here, aren't I?

261
00:34:40,713 --> 00:34:45,967
- Are you with anyone?
- Right this second?

262
00:34:45,968 --> 00:34:52,432
- No, I mean like...
- Like a steady boyfriend?

263
00:34:52,683 --> 00:34:56,102
No.

264
00:34:58,105 --> 00:35:04,486
- You could have anyone.
- No, I...

265
00:35:12,953 --> 00:35:16,873
What about you?

266
00:35:34,015 --> 00:35:39,019
- Why not?
- 'Cause I...

267
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:45,442
I just...

268
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:54,451
I know.

269
00:35:54,744 --> 00:35:58,497
I know.

270
00:36:48,546 --> 00:36:50,506
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

271
00:36:50,757 --> 00:36:55,344
- It's late. What time is it?
- It's 10:30. Where are you going?

272
00:36:55,595 --> 00:37:01,392
I've got to get home.
I have a million things to do tonight.

273
00:37:01,642 --> 00:37:05,228
Stay!

274
00:37:13,779 --> 00:37:17,240
Don't speak French.

275
00:37:41,806 --> 00:37:44,933
Estella?

276
00:37:48,563 --> 00:37:54,109
Excuse me. Have you seen Estella?

277
00:37:58,907 --> 00:38:05,413
Dinsmoor was weirder than
usual, but I had to see Estella.

278
00:38:13,212 --> 00:38:16,298
I never come here. Never.

279
00:38:16,549 --> 00:38:21,929
Do you know why?
Twenty-six years ago, I trusted.

280
00:38:22,179 --> 00:38:29,894
I saved myself. I was a virgin.
It's funny, huh?

281
00:38:30,645 --> 00:38:36,984
Those were the times,
that's how I was raised.

282
00:38:37,236 --> 00:38:42,282
What kind of creature takes
such a thing, such a gift, a trust?

283
00:38:42,533 --> 00:38:47,370
Who does this? Takes advantage
of a 42-year-old woman?

284
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:53,501
What kind of creature leaves
this woman waiting like a fool?

285
00:38:53,752 --> 00:39:00,967
A man does this, so men must pay.
Am I right?

286
00:39:03,052 --> 00:39:05,804
- Estella will make men weep.
- Do you know where she is?

287
00:39:06,055 --> 00:39:08,682
She'll break them.
I taught her well.

288
00:39:08,933 --> 00:39:14,021
When she returns, she'll cut through
them like a hot knife through butter.

289
00:39:14,271 --> 00:39:18,024
- Returns?
- Oh, my dear boy!

290
00:39:18,276 --> 00:39:20,986
Didn't you know?

291
00:39:21,237 --> 00:39:25,782
She's left for school.
Switzerland for two years, then Paris.

292
00:39:26,033 --> 00:39:32,706
Didn't she say goodbye?
I'm sure she meant to.

293
00:39:41,214 --> 00:39:45,426
See you next week, dear.

294
00:40:04,654 --> 00:40:07,948
Seven years passed.

295
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:10,993
I stopped going to Paradiso Perduto.

296
00:40:11,244 --> 00:40:12,745
I stopped painting.

297
00:40:12,996 --> 00:40:15,706
I put aside fantasy and the wealthy...

298
00:40:15,957 --> 00:40:19,001
... and the heavenly girl
who did not want me.

299
00:40:19,252 --> 00:40:24,256
None of it would happen to me again.
I'd seen through it.

300
00:40:24,507 --> 00:40:28,052
I elected to grow up.

301
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:12,053
Finn! This is Jerry Ragno.

302
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:16,014
Jerry, Mr. Ragno
is a lawyer in Miami.

303
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:21,269
And New York. We have
offices in Manhattan. So, Finn...

304
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:27,151
...I'm empowered by my client
to make your dreams come true.

305
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:35,617
Really? Any particular dream
or just all of them?

306
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:38,412
Have you ever shown your work?
No.

307
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:41,581
They had Finn's painting
at Washington Federal Bank.

308
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:48,171
Eight years ago. I gave all that up.
I don't understand what this is about.

309
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:54,219
How would you like a one-man show
at the Thrall Gallery?

310
00:41:54,469 --> 00:41:59,807
My client, Erica Thrall, wants you
in New York for a one-man show.

311
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:03,687
Have you ever sent slides
to the Thrall Gallery?

312
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,899
I sent slides everywhere
in high school.

313
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:10,777
They made an impression.
A ticket to New York...

314
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:14,406
...plus $1000 for incidentals.

315
00:42:14,656 --> 00:42:19,660
Sorry, they're all in hundreds.

316
00:42:30,087 --> 00:42:36,760
The hundreds aren't the problem.
I just... I don't paint anymore.

317
00:42:45,561 --> 00:42:50,106
Whose business was it
what I did with my life?

318
00:42:50,358 --> 00:42:55,029
Who'd gotten my life in order? Me.
I was in control.

319
00:42:55,279 --> 00:42:59,783
And everything I wanted, I had.

320
00:43:00,034 --> 00:43:05,414
Ms. Dinsmoor?
Are cocktails ready, Thomas?

321
00:43:05,664 --> 00:43:10,126
No, it's me. It's Finn.

322
00:43:10,377 --> 00:43:12,921
- I came...
Looking for Estella.

323
00:43:13,171 --> 00:43:19,426
- That hook is in deep, isn't it, dear?
- I came to ask you a question.

324
00:43:19,677 --> 00:43:23,931
After nearly 10 years
without a word, without a visit...

325
00:43:24,183 --> 00:43:27,811
...you've come to interrogate me.
How interesting.

326
00:43:28,061 --> 00:43:33,524
- I'm sorry. Things happened.
- The love of your life left you.

327
00:43:33,775 --> 00:43:38,904
It hurts, doesn't it?
Come closer.

328
00:43:50,708 --> 00:43:54,419
I've gone red.

329
00:43:55,045 --> 00:43:59,590
- I noticed. It's nice.
- And look at you.

330
00:43:59,841 --> 00:44:03,928
All grown up. A man.

331
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:07,975
Ms. Dinsmoor, a lawyer named Ragno
came to see me.

332
00:44:08,225 --> 00:44:10,894
- The spider.
- Do you know him?

333
00:44:11,145 --> 00:44:16,066
"Ragno" means "spider" in Italian.
You must learn other languages.

334
00:44:16,316 --> 00:44:21,654
He represents an art gallery owner in
New York who wants to show my work.

335
00:44:21,905 --> 00:44:26,659
You can draw. Can't dance
worth a shit, but you can draw.

336
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:30,705
Did you know anything about this?

337
00:44:30,955 --> 00:44:37,919
- Estella is in New York.
- I doubt our paths will cross.

338
00:44:39,088 --> 00:44:43,008
- So you're going?
- Should I?

339
00:44:47,138 --> 00:44:50,849
I remember watching you
from that very window.

340
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:57,898
Scared little mouse scurrying across
my garden and through my front door.

341
00:44:58,149 --> 00:45:05,822
Now another door opens.
What will our mouse do?

342
00:45:11,453 --> 00:45:15,707
- I expect an invitation.
- I'm sorry?

343
00:45:15,957 --> 00:45:21,253
To your opening, your show.

344
00:45:27,386 --> 00:45:31,264
- What equipment are you flying?
- What?

345
00:45:31,515 --> 00:45:33,850
Is it a wide body or a 767?

346
00:45:34,101 --> 00:45:38,188
I've no idea,
I just hope it stays up there.

347
00:45:38,438 --> 00:45:42,650
- You'd better get on.
- Yeah.

348
00:45:42,901 --> 00:45:48,489
What happens if I get up there
and I can't deliver?

349
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:54,286
Finn. There's nothing harder
than being given your chance.

350
00:45:54,537 --> 00:45:59,541
- At least that's what I hear.
- Yeah?

351
00:46:51,718 --> 00:46:55,054
Taxi!

352
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:01,310
- Have you got change for a dollar?
- What?

353
00:47:01,561 --> 00:47:08,317
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Fuck you, man! Fuck you!

354
00:47:08,568 --> 00:47:11,070
Well, then, there I was.

355
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:16,074
Ms. Dinsmoor, as my secret benefactor,
sent me to New York to draw.

356
00:47:16,325 --> 00:47:19,119
To have the girl, to have it all.

357
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:24,123
And I looked out on the great city,
as so many before, which held it all.

358
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:27,585
And it was that close,
and it was mine.

359
00:47:27,837 --> 00:47:34,760
"Liebchen, guten Morgen." Are you still
holding the red and green Picasso?

360
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:40,098
I think I have somebody interested.
No, I can't say right now.

361
00:47:40,349 --> 00:47:46,271
Just the Picasso.
Fabelhaft. Danke.

362
00:47:46,688 --> 00:47:50,274
Here's where you
show me your work, darling.

363
00:47:50,525 --> 00:47:55,237
- I told you, I don't have any.
- Then you'd better get busy.

364
00:47:55,488 --> 00:47:59,283
Why am I here?
You saw some slides?

365
00:47:59,534 --> 00:48:04,038
I gave Keith Haring a show
after he drew a sketch in my hand.

366
00:48:04,288 --> 00:48:06,289
But which paintings did you like?

367
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:10,668
I saw the beginning of something,
and here you are.

368
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:12,964
Annette, Sotheby's.

369
00:48:13,214 --> 00:48:19,636
What you do is up to you. Stay and
paint or enjoy the sights and go home.

370
00:48:19,887 --> 00:48:23,849
Either way, I always enjoy
meeting a young painter.

371
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:28,270
Look, I mean, I'll do it.

372
00:48:29,313 --> 00:48:33,650
I said that I'll do the paintings.

373
00:48:33,901 --> 00:48:40,073
Wonderful. Call Marcy
when you have something for us.

374
00:48:49,166 --> 00:48:50,750
And I could still draw.

375
00:48:51,001 --> 00:48:54,921
Nothing had lessened it as much
as I had abused it, abandoned it.

376
00:48:55,172 --> 00:48:58,550
It was a gift, and it was still mine.

377
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,886
And everything else was less real.

378
00:49:02,137 --> 00:49:05,390
What can it mean?
That picture of the world.

379
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:10,144
But when it's true, we recognize it
in ourselves, in others.

380
00:49:10,395 --> 00:49:17,068
We recognize it, like love,
completely undeserved.

381
00:49:33,126 --> 00:49:37,004
You're drooling.

382
00:49:37,129 --> 00:49:41,383
So, Finn Bell.
In New York.

383
00:49:41,634 --> 00:49:43,052
That's right.

384
00:49:43,302 --> 00:49:48,139
I thought I saw you last Christmas.
I was driving down 5th.

385
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:50,308
I just got here.

386
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:54,604
Actually, now that I see you,
this guy was bigger.

387
00:49:54,855 --> 00:49:57,857
- He's bigger.
- Fatter.

388
00:49:58,108 --> 00:50:01,152
- He had long hair.
- You thought it was me?

389
00:50:01,403 --> 00:50:07,700
- I hadn't seen you in years.
- It has been a while.

390
00:50:08,701 --> 00:50:12,204
And here we are.

391
00:50:16,084 --> 00:50:19,503
- I have to run.
- Wait, maybe we could...

392
00:50:19,754 --> 00:50:24,466
Tomorrow at the Borough Club
around 6. I'm meeting some friends.

393
00:50:24,717 --> 00:50:27,719
If you're free, that is.

394
00:50:27,971 --> 00:50:31,682
I'm free.

395
00:50:32,725 --> 00:50:36,728
I'm glad you're here.

396
00:50:41,817 --> 00:50:47,197
A long time ago there lived
two brilliant artists. True geniuses.

397
00:50:47,447 --> 00:50:51,784
One day one of them
was painting out in the forest...

398
00:50:52,036 --> 00:50:56,331
... and he came upon this dog
who was crying, obviously lost.

399
00:50:56,582 --> 00:51:00,460
A puppy.
Yes, sure. A puppy, fine.

400
00:51:00,711 --> 00:51:05,298
He couldn't concentrate anyway,
so he scooped the puppy up...

401
00:51:05,549 --> 00:51:08,760
... and took him into town
to find its owner...

402
00:51:09,011 --> 00:51:12,472
... who turned out to be
the prince of the kingdom...

403
00:51:12,722 --> 00:51:16,350
... who was eternally grateful
and very wealthy.

404
00:51:16,601 --> 00:51:20,938
That artist's name was Michelangelo.
True story.

405
00:51:21,189 --> 00:51:26,735
The other artist's name was... Nobody
knows, he was never heard from again.

406
00:51:26,986 --> 00:51:29,696
Right, that's so true, Walter.

407
00:51:29,947 --> 00:51:33,116
Can I smoke?

408
00:51:34,661 --> 00:51:41,083
- It's your last one.
- That's all right.

409
00:51:41,334 --> 00:51:45,212
So you... Cigarette, please.
You're from Florida too?

410
00:51:45,463 --> 00:51:48,507
- Yes.
- Everybody is from Florida.

411
00:51:48,758 --> 00:51:51,760
I'm not, I hate Florida.
Too much sun.

412
00:51:52,011 --> 00:51:53,470
Really?

413
00:51:53,721 --> 00:51:56,932
Actually, Finn was my childhood...

414
00:51:57,182 --> 00:52:00,727
What were you exactly?

415
00:52:00,978 --> 00:52:06,274
He was my first love.

416
00:52:06,441 --> 00:52:08,818
If that's what you say.

417
00:52:09,069 --> 00:52:12,864
He painted a beautiful portrait of me
when I was 10.

418
00:52:13,115 --> 00:52:15,909
I sat for a portrait once. Electric.

419
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,745
You sucked off de Kooning!

420
00:52:18,996 --> 00:52:24,334
- I'd like to paint you again.
- Would you?

421
00:52:24,584 --> 00:52:28,796
I want to paint your portrait.

422
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:34,969
- What do you think, sweetheart?
Me?

423
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:37,930
Well, gee.

424
00:52:38,181 --> 00:52:43,352
Do you charge by the inch
or by the hour?

425
00:52:46,522 --> 00:52:48,982
- What?
- How do you price your art?

426
00:52:49,233 --> 00:52:54,779
By its size, square footage,
or the time it takes to make...

427
00:52:55,031 --> 00:52:58,867
...the art?

428
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:06,750
I've actually never sold a painting.

429
00:53:07,001 --> 00:53:11,421
Excuse me, sir!
Please, sir. Excuse me, sir.

430
00:53:11,672 --> 00:53:17,218
That's a club jacket you have on,
this is your jacket.

431
00:53:17,469 --> 00:53:21,180
Let me help you.

432
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:24,934
Thank you.

433
00:54:20,823 --> 00:54:26,369
- What are you doing here?
- Don't you want to paint me?

434
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:30,540
You've slept all day.
It's time to work.

435
00:54:30,791 --> 00:54:35,879
- Do you want to do it right now?
- Mm-hm.

436
00:54:36,713 --> 00:54:39,882
Okay.

437
00:54:40,425 --> 00:54:46,472
How did you get in here?
They just let you in, huh?

438
00:54:46,556 --> 00:54:51,435
It's not top-of-the-line security.

439
00:55:19,254 --> 00:55:25,009
- Do you want me sitting or standing?
- Both. I mean, whatever.

440
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:28,763
Sitting.

441
00:57:35,971 --> 00:57:41,893
I have to go. I have dinner
in one hour and I look a mess.

442
00:58:27,147 --> 00:58:29,774
- What are you doing?
- You forgot your shoes.

443
00:58:30,024 --> 00:58:34,069
What is it like not to feel anything?

444
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:37,156
Get the fuck out of here!

445
00:58:37,406 --> 00:58:39,991
Say there was a little girl.

446
00:58:40,242 --> 00:58:46,039
And from the time she could
understand, she was taught to fear.

447
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:48,708
Say she was taught to fear daylight.

448
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:54,339
She was taught it was her enemy,
that it would hurt her.

449
00:58:54,589 --> 00:58:57,133
And then one sunny day...

450
00:58:57,384 --> 00:59:03,348
...you ask her to go outside and play,
and she won't.

451
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:05,767
Can you be angry at her?

452
00:59:06,018 --> 00:59:13,817
I knew that girl, saw the light
in her eyes. That's still what I see.

453
00:59:14,484 --> 00:59:19,530
We are who we are.
People don't change.

454
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:27,579
Yeah, hold on.

455
00:59:28,039 --> 00:59:33,377
- What is it? Yeah?
- Hi, Finn.

456
00:59:33,627 --> 00:59:36,504
- Walter.
- I know.

457
00:59:36,755 --> 00:59:40,174
Is this a bad time for you?

458
00:59:40,426 --> 00:59:43,053
- I can...
- It's all right, come on in.

459
00:59:43,304 --> 00:59:45,347
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, come on in.

460
00:59:45,598 --> 00:59:48,183
Thank you.

461
00:59:48,434 --> 00:59:53,438
- What are you doing here?
- Estella said she posed for you.

462
00:59:53,689 --> 00:59:55,690
And I...

463
00:59:55,941 --> 01:00:01,779
...was curious. Wow!

464
01:00:03,907 --> 01:00:06,993
- You're really good.
- I had a good subject.

465
01:00:07,244 --> 01:00:12,790
Yeah, I'll say. She is incredible.

466
01:00:13,041 --> 01:00:16,711
I've got to be insane, right?

467
01:00:16,961 --> 01:00:20,297
- Why?
- To risk losing her.

468
01:00:20,548 --> 01:00:23,467
God, look at that one!
Look at this.

469
01:00:23,719 --> 01:00:27,472
And I still can't commit.
That's certifiable, right?

470
01:00:27,722 --> 01:00:32,226
You don't look crazy to me.

471
01:00:33,144 --> 01:00:36,105
I feel like a cliff diver
in Acapulco.

472
01:00:36,356 --> 01:00:40,860
I'm right at the edge, I'm supposed
to leap, the tide is high...

473
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:47,074
...and I think your friend Estella
is trying to give me a little shove.

474
01:00:47,324 --> 01:00:50,994
- What do you mean?
- You know, these, you...

475
01:00:51,245 --> 01:00:56,875
It's her charming little version
of a wake-up call.

476
01:00:57,125 --> 01:01:04,465
But, you know, I understand.
I'm dragging my feet.

477
01:01:06,093 --> 01:01:11,514
I'm sorry you got pulled into this mess.
She doesn't want to hurt you.

478
01:01:11,765 --> 01:01:18,229
In fact, I know that she
really cares about you. Really.

479
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,275
It's just who she is, you know?

480
01:01:22,526 --> 01:01:26,863
But I love her.

481
01:01:27,113 --> 01:01:34,203
I don't know. You know her longer
than I. Any advice for me?

482
01:01:34,454 --> 01:01:40,501
What do you think I should do
about me and Estella?

483
01:01:47,592 --> 01:01:52,513
I think you two are perfect together.

484
01:01:55,933 --> 01:01:58,518
Well, thank you.

485
01:01:58,769 --> 01:02:03,064
I should get out of your hair.
I appreciate your time.

486
01:02:03,315 --> 01:02:08,945
You're really good. I look forward
to seeing your show.

487
01:02:12,950 --> 01:02:16,536
Next week, I received a
postcard from Ms. Dinsmoor.

488
01:02:16,787 --> 01:02:21,249
A beach with palm trees, it
said, "How's my little mouse doing?"

489
01:02:21,499 --> 01:02:25,461
What were her plans for me?
Why was she promoting me?

490
01:02:25,713 --> 01:02:31,551
What could her reason be, if not
to make me equal with Estella?

491
01:02:34,137 --> 01:02:37,098
That same day,
I got a call from Ragno.

492
01:02:37,349 --> 01:02:42,186
- Hello?
In here.

493
01:02:49,318 --> 01:02:54,698
What do you think of the digs?
- It's cozy.

494
01:02:54,949 --> 01:02:57,367
It's yours.

495
01:02:57,618 --> 01:03:00,287
- What do you mean?
- You open in 10 weeks.

496
01:03:00,537 --> 01:03:06,292
We can reschedule, if...
- No, I'll be ready.

497
01:03:06,544 --> 01:03:09,880
You're moving here.
We've got food, paint, canvas.

498
01:03:10,131 --> 01:03:13,550
Anything else, just ask Erica.

499
01:03:13,801 --> 01:03:19,556
Do you know what I'd like? I'd like
some money. Some living expenses.

500
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:22,225
- I don't believe...
- Done.

501
01:03:22,476 --> 01:03:25,353
- Anything else?
- Some publicity for my show.

502
01:03:25,604 --> 01:03:27,814
No one's actually heard of you.

503
01:03:28,065 --> 01:03:33,903
"Fisherman from the Gulf Coast
Lands on Manhattan's Art Scene"?

504
01:03:34,154 --> 01:03:37,073
- My, aren't we media savvy.
- We learn.

505
01:03:37,323 --> 01:03:42,661
Call Marion, she'll know.
- Toast in my absence, I'm late.

506
01:03:42,912 --> 01:03:45,497
She's a barrel of laughs.

507
01:03:45,748 --> 01:03:48,959
An artist dropped out,
she had to redo her schedules.

508
01:03:49,211 --> 01:03:52,922
It's like someone wants
to turn this frog into a prince.

509
01:03:53,173 --> 01:03:56,968
What do you mean?
You know what I mean.

510
01:03:57,218 --> 01:04:00,512
It appears as if I have
a fairy godmother.

511
01:04:00,763 --> 01:04:03,932
Aren't you too old to believe
in fairy godmothers?

512
01:04:04,183 --> 01:04:07,519
Whatever you say, Spider man.

513
01:04:07,770 --> 01:04:12,149
"Ragno" means "spider" in Italian.

514
01:04:12,399 --> 01:04:16,819
See you at your opening. "Ciao."

515
01:04:18,447 --> 01:04:23,034
I was born again. Why not?
I had never asked for anything.

516
01:04:23,285 --> 01:04:27,872
If Dinsmoor, the art world and
the world chose to adopt me...

517
01:04:28,124 --> 01:04:29,416
... I could take it.

518
01:04:29,667 --> 01:04:33,962
New York held it out, and I'd take it
and say thanks.

519
01:04:34,213 --> 01:04:38,091
You would too.

520
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:51,228
I was an orphan, raised by my
sister Maggie and her boyfriend Joe.

521
01:04:51,479 --> 01:04:55,983
Maggie took off
when I was still a kid.

522
01:04:56,234 --> 01:05:00,321
Joe was a big drug smuggler.

523
01:05:00,571 --> 01:05:03,657
Spent the '70s
in the Raiford Penitentiary.

524
01:05:03,908 --> 01:05:07,911
I came home one day,
I found him dead on the couch.

525
01:05:08,163 --> 01:05:09,664
He had OD'd.

526
01:05:09,915 --> 01:05:15,628
They took the apartment away,
so I spent the next years in a car.

527
01:05:15,879 --> 01:05:20,216
It wasn't that bad.
It was a big car, a '68 Riviera.

528
01:05:20,466 --> 01:05:23,260
It's a miracle you survived.

529
01:05:23,511 --> 01:05:27,264
- Do you like my paintings?
- Yeah.

530
01:05:28,015 --> 01:05:31,935
Why don't you tell me
about this beauty right here.

531
01:05:32,186 --> 01:05:35,897
That's some girl I knew
back in Florida.

532
01:05:36,148 --> 01:05:43,613
I used to have a huge crush on her.
Now I can't even remember her name.

533
01:05:49,537 --> 01:05:54,917
- This one looks a lot like the girl.
- It's the same girl. She grew up.

534
01:05:55,167 --> 01:05:58,712
- And you don't remember her name?
- No.

535
01:05:58,962 --> 01:06:02,465
Delicious. It's all coming
together, as I promised.

536
01:06:02,716 --> 01:06:08,221
Finn frenzy! Imagine what will happen
when they see your wonderful work.

537
01:06:08,471 --> 01:06:10,139
Your beloved per diem...

538
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:13,226
...and an invitation
to the Hamilton Museum benefit.

539
01:06:13,476 --> 01:06:14,977
Toss that.

540
01:06:15,228 --> 01:06:18,647
I killed a publicist for this.
It is the event.

541
01:06:18,898 --> 01:06:21,400
Old money, new money, big money.

542
01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:24,194
Everyone will be there,
including you.

543
01:06:24,445 --> 01:06:28,240
Erica!
- These are Finn's new paintings.

544
01:06:28,490 --> 01:06:33,286
- It's for you.
- If you don't like the portraits...

545
01:06:34,414 --> 01:06:37,792
Don't jump.

546
01:06:38,751 --> 01:06:41,044
Would you save me?

547
01:06:41,295 --> 01:06:45,048
Not in this suit.

548
01:06:45,090 --> 01:06:47,634
How are you?
Good. And you?

549
01:06:47,885 --> 01:06:49,511
Pretty well.

550
01:06:49,761 --> 01:06:52,013
Good-looking suit!
Good-looking day!

551
01:06:52,264 --> 01:06:54,182
It is.

552
01:06:54,433 --> 01:06:57,394
Seen "New York Magazine"?
Are you in it?

553
01:06:57,644 --> 01:07:02,148
It's just a little piece. It's
nice. You didn't see it?

554
01:07:02,398 --> 01:07:05,776
Thrall thinks that the show
will get good reviews.

555
01:07:06,027 --> 01:07:09,655
I don't want to jinx it,
but what does she know?

556
01:07:09,907 --> 01:07:13,618
The curator from the Whitney
came by. That was exciting.

557
01:07:13,869 --> 01:07:17,997
Wow! I'll say I knew you when.

558
01:07:18,248 --> 01:07:23,961
Listen.
What?

559
01:07:25,088 --> 01:07:29,258
Walter asked me to marry him.

560
01:07:29,842 --> 01:07:33,887
He wants to marry me.

561
01:07:36,141 --> 01:07:40,770
- Really?
- Yeah.

562
01:07:43,314 --> 01:07:47,442
Why are you telling me this?

563
01:07:47,694 --> 01:07:51,239
Because...

564
01:07:51,447 --> 01:07:58,745
I just... I wanted to know
if you had anything to say.

565
01:07:59,497 --> 01:08:03,042
Congratulations.

566
01:08:03,418 --> 01:08:07,046
Sounds wonderful.

567
01:08:07,297 --> 01:08:11,384
I wish you both the best of luck.

568
01:08:11,634 --> 01:08:14,761
- I've got to go. I've got to...
- Finn.

569
01:08:15,012 --> 01:08:18,348
- I've got some business.
- Finn, wait.

570
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,518
Why had she told me?

571
01:08:20,769 --> 01:08:25,565
She told me to wound me,
or out of habit or to drive me mad.

572
01:08:25,815 --> 01:08:31,195
I didn't care if it was a clue or it
was a plea or it was a tease.

573
01:08:31,445 --> 01:08:37,867
No. She told me so I would stop her,
and of course I would.

574
01:08:46,961 --> 01:08:50,547
Fashionably late. I have hordes
of people to meet you.

575
01:08:50,798 --> 01:08:55,635
This is the senator.
Finn! Sorry, senator.

576
01:08:55,886 --> 01:09:00,640
As the evening mists
Were rising

577
01:09:00,892 --> 01:09:05,855
Finn! So good to see you.
A friend of mine is decorating...

578
01:09:06,105 --> 01:09:09,524
- Have you seen Estella?
- No.

579
01:09:09,776 --> 01:09:15,573
Very interested in getting
some art. Interested?

580
01:09:15,573 --> 01:09:19,201
I wanted to call you.
Congratulations on your success.

581
01:09:19,451 --> 01:09:20,994
You're all over the place.

582
01:09:21,245 --> 01:09:25,123
The boy with the hands.
I saw your spread. Anton Le Farge.

583
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:28,836
Be nice to Anton,
he has a lot of empty wall space.

584
01:09:29,087 --> 01:09:30,755
I'm taking my time.

585
01:09:31,005 --> 01:09:33,841
You should get to Finn
while his rates are reasonable.

586
01:09:34,091 --> 01:09:38,762
How did we say you should price
your art? Was it by canvas size or...?

587
01:09:39,013 --> 01:09:41,265
By its beauty.

588
01:09:41,515 --> 01:09:44,267
- There you are.
- I have to talk to you.

589
01:09:44,519 --> 01:09:48,689
- We've got to go, we're late.
- We just got here.

590
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:53,152
We're to meet the Barrows
at Kelly and Ping's 10 minutes ago.

591
01:09:53,402 --> 01:09:57,405
Good night, kids. Have fun.
Congratulations again, Finn.

592
01:09:57,656 --> 01:10:03,369
This is the artist I was telling you
about. Senator Elwood, Finn Bell.

593
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:06,998
Thrall has told me
so much about you.

594
01:10:10,795 --> 01:10:13,255
- What about my friend?
- Not now.

595
01:10:13,506 --> 01:10:17,593
Thrall is a loser in this town,
I can introduce you to...

596
01:10:17,843 --> 01:10:22,555
- Sorry.
- It's all relationships, isn't it?

597
01:10:22,806 --> 01:10:26,351
Don't touch me.

598
01:10:33,359 --> 01:10:37,863
Can I get you a taxi, sir?

599
01:11:40,217 --> 01:11:45,013
Excuse me, sir. Sir! Sir!

600
01:11:52,729 --> 01:11:57,233
Hey, Finn! This is Finn.
How do you do?

601
01:11:57,485 --> 01:12:04,158
- Can I offer you a chair or a towel?
- Would you like to dance?

602
01:12:13,041 --> 01:12:16,919
Do you know him?
Yes.

603
01:12:17,129 --> 01:12:22,258
- Is everything okay?
- Yes.

604
01:13:41,171 --> 01:13:45,383
I want you inside me.

605
01:14:33,807 --> 01:14:36,809
I have to go home,
I owe my aunt a visit.

606
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:40,730
But you'll be back?

607
01:14:40,730 --> 01:14:46,443
For your show? Of course.

608
01:14:51,241 --> 01:14:55,036
I do love the way you dance.

609
01:15:07,966 --> 01:15:10,176
Hi!

610
01:15:10,426 --> 01:15:13,804
Congratulations!

611
01:15:14,056 --> 01:15:18,727
- Have you seen Estella?
- I'll send her over when she arrives.

612
01:15:18,977 --> 01:15:23,689
- Congratulations! Great job.
- It's wonderful, Finn.

613
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:25,733
- So...
- Look who's here.

614
01:15:25,984 --> 01:15:29,278
- All your dreams come true?
- We'll see.

615
01:15:29,529 --> 01:15:31,197
I want you to meet some people.

616
01:15:31,447 --> 01:15:33,282
- Have you seen Estella?
- No.

617
01:15:33,533 --> 01:15:37,828
There's a very important guy here,
Carter Macleish, he's a critic.

618
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:40,790
- Congratulations!
- Thanks.

619
01:15:41,041 --> 01:15:44,877
Nice to see you!

620
01:15:47,130 --> 01:15:51,425
We'll be right back. Thanks.

621
01:15:53,261 --> 01:15:57,890
- Is Clemente here?
- Carter. Nice to see you.

622
01:15:58,141 --> 01:16:01,936
- Finn Bell, Carter Macleish.
- Congratulations.

623
01:16:02,187 --> 01:16:07,525
Ruth you know. It's a most impressive
show, wouldn't you say?

624
01:16:07,775 --> 01:16:11,320
It is that!

625
01:16:15,408 --> 01:16:21,455
Richard! Richard! Will you do
a photo of us? Carter, come on.

626
01:16:21,706 --> 01:16:25,876
Finn! Finn!

627
01:16:26,127 --> 01:16:29,588
What is that?
Do another one.

628
01:16:29,839 --> 01:16:35,928
- I think you have a fan here.
- I'm sorry, will you excuse me?

629
01:16:37,388 --> 01:16:43,101
Hey, Finn! How are you doing?
Surprise, surprise!

630
01:16:43,353 --> 01:16:46,689
- What are you doing here?
- Where did you think I'd be?

631
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:51,110
I had to change in my car.
It's a rental tux, but what the hell.

632
01:16:51,361 --> 01:16:54,655
It looks good.
Do you want to get a juice?

633
01:16:54,906 --> 01:16:58,284
It's Jerry, huh? Hey, Jerry!

634
01:16:58,534 --> 01:17:04,581
Jerry! You son of a bitch,
you weren't bullshitting, were you?

635
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:06,918
Erica Thrall,
my Uncle Joe.

636
01:17:07,168 --> 01:17:12,214
Miss Thrall, hi. This is
your place, right? It's very nice.

637
01:17:12,465 --> 01:17:15,718
- Carter Macleish.
- Are you also from Florida?

638
01:17:15,968 --> 01:17:20,555
- Yes. I operate a fishing boat.
- This is Ruth.

639
01:17:20,806 --> 01:17:24,934
- Hi.
- Hey, Ruth.

640
01:17:25,186 --> 01:17:27,604
Hey!

641
01:17:27,814 --> 01:17:29,565
Look at me!

642
01:17:29,816 --> 01:17:33,736
Uncle Joe, the drug smuggler?
I thought you were dead.

643
01:17:33,986 --> 01:17:36,655
- Drugs?
- No, she's thinking about...

644
01:17:36,906 --> 01:17:40,576
No, I've been sober
for a good, long time now.

645
01:17:40,826 --> 01:17:43,161
Carter can't believe
it's your first show.

646
01:17:43,412 --> 01:17:45,830
- No, it's not.
- What do you mean?

647
01:17:46,082 --> 01:17:50,586
Finn had a show at the Washington
Federal a couple of years ago.

648
01:17:50,837 --> 01:17:53,047
- You know the Washington Federal?
- No.

649
01:17:53,297 --> 01:17:57,175
- It's not a gallery.
- It's a bank. Savings and loan.

650
01:17:57,426 --> 01:18:01,805
- A bank?
- This is my first gallery show.

651
01:18:02,056 --> 01:18:03,849
And you're self-taught?

652
01:18:04,099 --> 01:18:06,392
That was a gift.
Finn always had it.

653
01:18:06,643 --> 01:18:12,189
Seven months old, his sister and I took
him to the beach. He drew in the sand.

654
01:18:12,442 --> 01:18:17,446
One night he took Maggie's best
perfume and drew with it in the street.

655
01:18:17,697 --> 01:18:21,158
He poured it all out,
and then he lit it...

656
01:18:21,409 --> 01:18:29,208
Just up in flames. The most beautiful
designs you ever saw. Just...

657
01:18:30,126 --> 01:18:33,212
- Are you all right?
That's my fault.

658
01:18:33,463 --> 01:18:36,257
Your trousers, are they all right?

659
01:18:36,507 --> 01:18:39,426
Just leave it, Joe.

660
01:18:39,677 --> 01:18:41,887
Erica, it's fine.

661
01:18:42,138 --> 01:18:45,724
Joe, just leave it!

662
01:18:50,729 --> 01:18:54,274
I'm sor...

663
01:18:54,692 --> 01:19:00,280
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, it's just...

664
01:19:00,448 --> 01:19:07,079
Oh, man. Excuse me, I'm sorry.

665
01:19:15,379 --> 01:19:19,215
Excuse me.

666
01:19:19,383 --> 01:19:23,970
Joe. Joe!

667
01:19:24,430 --> 01:19:28,350
Jeez, I'm...

668
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:32,603
Listen, I'm going to head out,
because I'm starving.

669
01:19:32,854 --> 01:19:36,399
I'm going to find a McDonald's
or something and...

670
01:19:36,651 --> 01:19:40,487
So you go back in, and I'm going
to talk to you later.

671
01:19:40,738 --> 01:19:46,076
Joe! Come on, I mean...

672
01:19:46,327 --> 01:19:51,707
Joe, listen. This is work.

673
01:19:52,165 --> 01:19:58,295
Sure. Come on, I get it.

674
01:19:59,423 --> 01:20:02,384
Finn.

675
01:20:05,471 --> 01:20:08,223
You dazzle them.

676
01:20:08,474 --> 01:20:12,019
Go ahead.

677
01:20:15,647 --> 01:20:19,525
Jeez, I'm proud of you, Finn.

678
01:20:19,777 --> 01:20:24,865
And I always have been.

679
01:20:26,367 --> 01:20:31,163
So, just...

680
01:20:36,251 --> 01:20:39,504
Finn!

681
01:20:39,754 --> 01:20:46,218
Go see if they know
how to smoke a swordfish.

682
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:07,199
The night
all my dreams came true.

683
01:21:07,449 --> 01:21:11,828
Like all happy endings it was
a tragedy, of my own device.

684
01:21:12,079 --> 01:21:14,831
For I'd succeeded.
I'd cut myself loose...

685
01:21:15,082 --> 01:21:19,544
... from Joe, from the past,
from the gulf, from poverty.

686
01:21:19,794 --> 01:21:21,921
I had invented myself.

687
01:21:22,172 --> 01:21:26,134
I had done it cruelly,
but I had done it. I was free.

688
01:21:33,016 --> 01:21:36,018
I did it! I did it!

689
01:21:36,269 --> 01:21:38,562
I am a wild success!

690
01:21:38,814 --> 01:21:42,776
I showed them all! All my paintings.

691
01:21:43,026 --> 01:21:47,738
You don't have to be embarrassed
by me anymore. I'm rich!

692
01:21:47,990 --> 01:21:53,912
Isn't that what you wanted?
Isn't it great? Are we happy now?

693
01:21:54,162 --> 01:21:58,582
Don't you understand that
everything I do, I do it for you?

694
01:21:58,834 --> 01:22:03,671
Anything that might be
special in me is you.

695
01:22:17,102 --> 01:22:20,855
Estella!

696
01:22:37,497 --> 01:22:42,376
Finn! What a lovely surprise!

697
01:22:42,627 --> 01:22:47,506
- What are you doing here?
- I own this house. I was born here.

698
01:22:47,757 --> 01:22:49,758
- I haven't been here for ages.
- Where's Estella?

699
01:22:50,009 --> 01:22:56,682
Since I had to come up for the event,
I figured, "Why not stay there?"

700
01:22:56,934 --> 01:23:02,355
- What event? My opening?
- No. Estella's wedding.

701
01:23:02,606 --> 01:23:04,941
- What?
- You were the catalyst.

702
01:23:05,191 --> 01:23:12,656
The fool wouldn't commit to Estella,
but then you came on the scene.

703
01:23:13,032 --> 01:23:19,204
- I don't believe it.
- Storybook, isn't it?

704
01:23:25,086 --> 01:23:27,963
Why?

705
01:23:28,214 --> 01:23:31,759
At first you were practice for her,
a teaching device.

706
01:23:32,010 --> 01:23:38,307
Throw a mouse in with the snake,
teach it to hunt, swallow food whole.

707
01:23:38,558 --> 01:23:44,104
I must say, you didn't provide
much of a challenge.

708
01:23:47,108 --> 01:23:50,569
Now, now.

709
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:53,238
You enjoyed it.

710
01:23:53,489 --> 01:23:58,535
And I warned you, years ago.
I didn't have to do that.

711
01:23:58,787 --> 01:24:03,207
I told you the girl
would hurt you terribly. Didn't I?

712
01:24:03,458 --> 01:24:07,545
You chose not to listen.

713
01:24:11,758 --> 01:24:14,969
Well...

714
01:24:15,052 --> 01:24:19,389
I suggest you look on the bright side.

715
01:24:23,812 --> 01:24:28,316
We are together, joined.
You, Estella and I.

716
01:24:28,566 --> 01:24:31,902
A pyramid of pain.

717
01:24:32,153 --> 01:24:39,576
It's not love, but it is a bond.
We are together.

718
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:50,796
Give me your hand.

719
01:25:08,231 --> 01:25:12,318
Do you know what this is?

720
01:25:12,568 --> 01:25:16,947
It's my heart.

721
01:25:18,324 --> 01:25:21,451
And it's broken.

722
01:25:26,666 --> 01:25:30,711
Can you feel that?

723
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:38,552
I'm sorry.

724
01:25:38,803 --> 01:25:42,181
I'm sorry.

725
01:25:48,355 --> 01:25:52,317
What have I done?!

726
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:22,512
The girl, the money, fame, revenge.

727
01:26:22,763 --> 01:26:26,850
They had been Dinsmoor's
sick obsessions.

728
01:26:27,101 --> 01:26:30,103
And now they were mine.

729
01:26:30,354 --> 01:26:34,232
He's not under the car, Jojo.
How are you?

730
01:26:34,484 --> 01:26:40,072
- Who's this kid?
- Don't worry about him. Keep looking.

731
01:26:44,910 --> 01:26:48,872
Hey!

732
01:26:51,625 --> 01:26:56,879
Listen, listen.
Can I just talk one second?

733
01:26:59,175 --> 01:27:05,180
Can I call the police on your
phone? Some armed guys are chasing me.

734
01:27:05,431 --> 01:27:08,475
All right, come on.

735
01:27:30,664 --> 01:27:33,208
Here you go.

736
01:27:33,458 --> 01:27:38,045
Hello? There are some
armed gentlemen chasing me.

737
01:27:38,297 --> 01:27:41,299
Could you send some police to...?
What's the address?

738
01:27:41,550 --> 01:27:44,344
111 Greenwich.
111 Greenwich Street.

739
01:27:44,595 --> 01:27:51,059
Arthur Lustig. Could you send them
as soon as you can, please?

740
01:27:51,518 --> 01:27:55,521
Thanks. Arthur Lustig.

741
01:27:55,772 --> 01:28:00,151
So the police are coming?
And these guys, they're after you?

742
01:28:00,403 --> 01:28:06,950
This is a great place.
Are you an artist?

743
01:28:07,201 --> 01:28:09,619
Yes, I am.
Tonight was my opening.

744
01:28:09,870 --> 01:28:11,871
Congratulations.
Thanks.

745
01:28:12,122 --> 01:28:18,127
What's your name?
Finnegan Bell.

746
01:28:18,378 --> 01:28:23,632
- Like Finn?
- Exactly.

747
01:28:26,137 --> 01:28:29,306
I'm sorry, do I know you?

748
01:28:31,934 --> 01:28:34,895
I don't think so.

749
01:28:35,145 --> 01:28:39,107
- You don't remember me, do you?
- No.

750
01:28:39,107 --> 01:28:40,566
Look, I don't know...

751
01:28:40,817 --> 01:28:46,030
Whisper! Whisper! Whisper!

752
01:28:47,575 --> 01:28:53,956
That's right, my boy. It's me.

753
01:28:54,581 --> 01:28:59,794
Look at you. Look at you!
You're all grown up.

754
01:29:00,045 --> 01:29:03,339
Don't you want to know
what happened to me?

755
01:29:03,590 --> 01:29:06,801
After I left you,
they caught me.

756
01:29:07,052 --> 01:29:10,346
I escaped again, and I relocated...

757
01:29:10,597 --> 01:29:17,311
...many years abroad.
Until now. Until now.

758
01:29:19,064 --> 01:29:21,524
I'm glad things
worked out for you.

759
01:29:21,775 --> 01:29:24,736
Fucking glad.

760
01:29:24,986 --> 01:29:28,322
It's great.

761
01:29:29,617 --> 01:29:34,413
Who's that handsome young man over
there? You did think about me!

762
01:29:34,663 --> 01:29:36,539
You scared the shit out of me.

763
01:29:36,790 --> 01:29:42,670
I like that. Yeah, I like that.

764
01:29:45,757 --> 01:29:48,593
That's really good.
How much is it?

765
01:29:48,844 --> 01:29:55,183
- Is it for sale?
- Actually, the whole show sold out.

766
01:29:55,434 --> 01:29:58,228
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, I'm lucky.

767
01:29:58,478 --> 01:30:01,939
No, you're not lucky.
You deserve your success.

768
01:30:02,190 --> 01:30:06,944
You're a talented young man.
You're a fine artist.

769
01:30:07,195 --> 01:30:11,866
Your whole...
This place is...

770
01:30:12,201 --> 01:30:15,454
Might I ask a personal question?

771
01:30:15,704 --> 01:30:21,125
- What does a place like this cost?
- The rent?

772
01:30:21,376 --> 01:30:24,420
I don't know.
It's taken care of.

773
01:30:24,671 --> 01:30:28,841
Oh, yeah? Could I ask who by?

774
01:30:29,092 --> 01:30:35,097
- A lawyer. Why?
- No reason. I'm happy for you.

775
01:30:35,974 --> 01:30:41,020
- Do you mind if I have a drink?
- The cops will be here any minute.

776
01:30:41,271 --> 01:30:44,440
- They're always late.
- It is late.

777
01:30:44,691 --> 01:30:49,236
- I'm sure you understand.
- Understand?

778
01:30:49,487 --> 01:30:53,032
You're sure I would understand what?

779
01:30:53,282 --> 01:30:56,535
The police
will be here any minute.

780
01:30:56,787 --> 01:31:00,123
- No, they won't.
- They won't. Why not?

781
01:31:00,374 --> 01:31:03,001
- I didn't call them.
- You didn't?

782
01:31:03,251 --> 01:31:06,128
I pressed my finger on the button.

783
01:31:06,379 --> 01:31:09,173
- Why?
- They're looking for me too.

784
01:31:09,424 --> 01:31:15,304
They are?
And those guys down there?

785
01:31:15,555 --> 01:31:21,143
Old associates. They have a beef about
something they should've figured out.

786
01:31:21,395 --> 01:31:24,731
- You should leave.
- Let me finish my drink.

787
01:31:24,981 --> 01:31:29,109
Just give me a minute.

788
01:31:29,235 --> 01:31:32,988
It's so good to see you.

789
01:31:33,239 --> 01:31:39,536
You don't know how happy it makes me
to see how you've turned out.

790
01:31:39,788 --> 01:31:44,333
You grew up. Little Finn.

791
01:31:44,584 --> 01:31:48,546
You're a grownup.
You're a man now.

792
01:31:48,797 --> 01:31:52,550
A famous artist.

793
01:31:54,552 --> 01:31:57,763
You live this life.

794
01:31:58,014 --> 01:32:02,518
Mix with all kinds of
interesting people.

795
01:32:02,769 --> 01:32:08,816
I'm very impressed, and nobody
deserves it better than you.

796
01:32:09,067 --> 01:32:14,613
I remember when you were a little
kid. A good-hearted little kid.

797
01:32:14,864 --> 01:32:17,408
Little Finn.

798
01:32:17,658 --> 01:32:23,330
The one person who did a really
pure and good thing for me.

799
01:32:23,582 --> 01:32:31,297
Congratulations on your success,
on your show, on everything.

800
01:32:32,131 --> 01:32:35,467
To you.

801
01:32:40,306 --> 01:32:43,559
Thank you. I appreciate that.

802
01:32:43,810 --> 01:32:47,271
I do.

803
01:32:47,522 --> 01:32:53,777
It's just that... the truth is,
it's making me really uncomfortable.

804
01:32:54,028 --> 01:32:56,530
Would you mind?

805
01:32:56,781 --> 01:33:02,077
I don't want you feeling badly.
I don't want you feeling badly.

806
01:33:02,328 --> 01:33:08,959
I just came to see you, say hello.
Now I'm happy.

807
01:33:11,004 --> 01:33:14,966
If it was another night, we...

808
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:30,773
This is great.
This is the way it should be.

809
01:33:31,024 --> 01:33:35,111
This is the way it should be.

810
01:33:36,904 --> 01:33:41,116
Ragno did a good job.

811
01:34:06,350 --> 01:34:07,934
Hey. Hey.

812
01:34:08,185 --> 01:34:14,315
Don't go down there. Those guys
are there. There's a better way.

813
01:34:39,592 --> 01:34:43,637
You know where you're headed?
JFK.

814
01:34:50,436 --> 01:34:54,356
So where are you going?
Paris, city of lights.

815
01:34:54,606 --> 01:34:58,985
Come with me to Paris.
I'll get a ticket on the Concorde.

816
01:34:59,237 --> 01:35:02,364
I can't go to France.
You will love Paris.

817
01:35:02,615 --> 01:35:10,414
I love Paris in the springtime
I love Paris in the fall

818
01:35:10,831 --> 01:35:15,502
Paris is a beautiful city, a
city of culture, a magnificent city.

819
01:35:15,752 --> 01:35:18,004
It's got elegance, beauty.

820
01:35:18,256 --> 01:35:21,258
You gotta go to Paris.
You won't regret it.

821
01:35:21,509 --> 01:35:25,804
Every artist must go to Paris
at least once.

822
01:35:26,055 --> 01:35:30,726
The streets, the romance,
the women. The women...

823
01:35:30,976 --> 01:35:34,354
- You should come.
- I can't go to France.

824
01:35:34,605 --> 01:35:38,441
Do you hear that shrieking?
The subway's wheels...

825
01:35:38,692 --> 01:35:42,820
- Is that you? Arthur!
- You look like Howard Hughes.

826
01:35:43,072 --> 01:35:47,826
- Have you been on a desert island?
- I've been on vacation.

827
01:35:48,077 --> 01:35:52,164
You're heavier.
I got fat. I got kids too.

828
01:35:52,414 --> 01:35:55,124
Age catches up with you.

829
01:35:55,375 --> 01:35:59,712
Arthur, Tommy wants to invite
you to the club for old time's sake.

830
01:35:59,963 --> 01:36:02,381
- Give me Tommy's number...
- We'll come over.

831
01:36:02,633 --> 01:36:06,386
- All right, two minutes.
We're coming there, Arthur.

832
01:36:06,637 --> 01:36:10,432
We'll wait right here.

833
01:36:10,641 --> 01:36:13,477
Come on!

834
01:36:29,243 --> 01:36:33,538
What are you doing there?
You told me to come over here.

835
01:36:33,789 --> 01:36:39,669
I thought you wanted me
to come over here.

836
01:36:45,593 --> 01:36:47,720
Tommy's not going to like this.

837
01:36:47,970 --> 01:36:52,432
Come here!

838
01:36:58,605 --> 01:37:01,441
Sorry, guys.

839
01:37:01,525 --> 01:37:04,778
You have this much fun
with your artist friends?

840
01:37:05,028 --> 01:37:11,492
- Is this fun? You're having fun?
- Are you going to miss me?

841
01:37:11,744 --> 01:37:15,080
- Why don't you come?
- I can't go to Paris.

842
01:37:15,330 --> 01:37:22,169
I love Paris in the springtime
I love Paris in the...

843
01:37:44,151 --> 01:37:46,528
No, no, I'm not hurt.

844
01:37:46,778 --> 01:37:52,533
- You're hurt bad.
- Stay, stay. Attaboy.

845
01:37:59,124 --> 01:38:02,126
Oh, jeez.

846
01:38:08,466 --> 01:38:15,097
I did a lot of bad things in my life.
A lot of bad things.

847
01:38:15,349 --> 01:38:18,685
But the one good thing...

848
01:38:18,936 --> 01:38:23,064
...is that any money I had,
anything I had...

849
01:38:23,315 --> 01:38:27,026
...and I made bullshit money,
I gave to you.

850
01:38:27,277 --> 01:38:30,029
All for you.

851
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:34,158
The one good thing I did...

852
01:38:34,868 --> 01:38:42,667
I set you up, I sent you to New York.
I did it all.

853
01:38:44,086 --> 01:38:48,465
- I bought that show.
- All my paintings?

854
01:38:52,051 --> 01:38:56,054
You're a great artist.

855
01:38:59,434 --> 01:39:06,148
Open up my suitcase.
Open my suitcase.

856
01:39:07,692 --> 01:39:12,237
What do you want?
Pull out the paper bag.

857
01:39:12,780 --> 01:39:17,868
Pull it back. That's it.

858
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:22,540
Remember this?

859
01:39:24,251 --> 01:39:27,754
See this?

860
01:39:31,382 --> 01:39:34,468
Very special.

861
01:39:37,388 --> 01:39:40,390
Look at this.

862
01:39:40,726 --> 01:39:44,020
It's beautiful.

863
01:39:51,653 --> 01:39:58,576
- What time is it?
- It's almost 6:00.

864
01:39:58,910 --> 01:40:02,955
We've still got time.

865
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:51,087
Perhaps he should have died
those years ago back in the gulf.

866
01:40:51,338 --> 01:40:53,715
Perhaps.

867
01:40:53,965 --> 01:41:01,388
But he'd lived to be my benefactor.
For good and ill.

868
01:41:01,639 --> 01:41:03,849
I went to Paris, worked there...

869
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:08,937
... and received everything
I thought I wanted.

870
01:41:09,189 --> 01:41:14,902
I heard about Estella from
time to time. She was divorced.

871
01:41:15,153 --> 01:41:17,780
The years went by.

872
01:41:18,031 --> 01:41:23,661
And then one day, I went home.

873
01:41:34,798 --> 01:41:36,216
Hi. I'm Finn.

874
01:41:36,466 --> 01:41:39,593
Joe!

875
01:41:41,095 --> 01:41:46,224
You dog! You dog. Why didn't you
tell us you were coming?

876
01:41:46,475 --> 01:41:49,394
- Who is he?
- This is Jesse and Clemma.

877
01:41:49,645 --> 01:41:55,567
And you came in time to do the
dishes. Are you hungry?

878
01:41:55,818 --> 01:42:00,739
Joe told me Ms. Dinsmoor
had died alone some years back.

879
01:42:00,990 --> 01:42:05,369
Her body lay there
undiscovered for a month.

880
01:42:05,619 --> 01:42:10,665
The mansion was due to be
torn down for a housing tract.

881
01:42:10,916 --> 01:42:16,296
I sat there and thought back
over the things I'd done.

882
01:42:16,548 --> 01:42:18,341
Over my life.

883
01:42:18,591 --> 01:42:23,762
And where, in that brief,
violent time, it had gone.

884
01:42:24,013 --> 01:42:28,392
And then, she came back again.

885
01:43:16,106 --> 01:43:19,233
Estella?

886
01:43:20,361 --> 01:43:23,488
Finn?

887
01:43:24,532 --> 01:43:27,659
Is that you?

888
01:43:32,122 --> 01:43:36,292
Is that your little girl?

889
01:43:36,794 --> 01:43:42,674
Oh, God.
She's beautiful.

890
01:43:46,721 --> 01:43:50,182
What are you doing here?

891
01:43:50,432 --> 01:43:53,559
I brought her
to show her this place.

892
01:43:53,811 --> 01:43:57,647
What's left of it.

893
01:44:00,776 --> 01:44:02,903
- Have you been here often?
- No.

894
01:44:03,154 --> 01:44:06,031
No, me neither.

895
01:44:06,282 --> 01:44:09,660
So, you're doing great.
I hear all about you.

896
01:44:09,910 --> 01:44:13,288
I'm doing all right.

897
01:44:13,622 --> 01:44:16,833
Yeah.

898
01:44:19,419 --> 01:44:24,173
Things have been different for me.

899
01:44:24,633 --> 01:44:29,095
For a long time I'd get...

900
01:44:30,181 --> 01:44:33,058
What?

901
01:44:35,811 --> 01:44:39,356
I think about you.

902
01:44:39,439 --> 01:44:42,817
A lot lately.

903
01:44:44,194 --> 01:44:47,321
I'm glad.

904
01:44:50,034 --> 01:44:54,079
Can you ever forgive me?

905
01:44:56,248 --> 01:44:59,709
Don't you know me at all?

906
01:45:05,715 --> 01:45:08,342
She did know me.

907
01:45:08,593 --> 01:45:11,387
And I knew her.

908
01:45:11,639 --> 01:45:16,018
I always had, from the first instant.

909
01:45:16,268 --> 01:45:20,313
And the rest of it, it didn't matter.

910
01:45:20,564 --> 01:45:24,275
It was past.

911
01:45:24,901 --> 01:45:29,363
It was as if it had never been.

912
01:45:30,700 --> 01:45:35,371
There was just my memory of it.
