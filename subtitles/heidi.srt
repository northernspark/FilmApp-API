2
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,680
Heidi!

3
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,200
Put those on!

4
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,560
Oh, not everything.
I'm so hot.

5
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,040
Well, keep on your Sunday dress...

6
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,200
and your coat.

7
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,640
- Hurry up!
- Oh, all right.

8
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,880
Come a long way?

9
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,520
Yes. From Mayenfeld.

10
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,480
We had a ride part
of the way on a cart.

11
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,320
Can you tell me the way
to Adolph Kramer's?

12
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,960
Did you say Adolph Kramer?

13
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,200
I did.

14
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,400
A stranger hereabouts, aren't you?

15
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,000
Yes. Why?

16
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,680
You must be, or you would have...

17
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,680
nothing to do
with that old heathen!

18
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,240
Heathen or not, I'm taking his
granddaughter to live with him.

19
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,680
Well do you know what
kind of a man he is?

20
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,560
That's none of my affair.
Which path do I take?

21
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,000
There, by the church.

22
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,120
If you listen to us,
you'll never take it.

23
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,520
Um-

24
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,480
Umm.

25
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,560
Hey! Turk!

26
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,680
Everybody knows you can't
turn your back on old Turk.

27
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,840
Well, old Turk isn't
much of a gentleman.

28
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,160
What's your name?

29
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm Peter, the goat general.

30
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,120
Who are you?

31
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,240
I'm Heidi, and I'm going to live
with Adolph Kramer, my grandfather.

32
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,800
Live with him?
Aren't you scared to?

33
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,120
Why should I be afraid
of my grandfather?

34
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,040
You'll find out. If ever
he gets good and mad at you...

35
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,600
he'll probably
cut your head off.

36
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,800
Like this!

37
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,840
Oh.

38
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,320
I don't care what you say.

39
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,840
She's my niece, and I can
do what I please with her.

40
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,320
Come along.
Come along. Hurry!

41
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,480
I'm Dete,
the sister of Gretchen...

42
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,960
who married your son Tobias.

43
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,360
I've brought their orphan
to live with you.

44
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,720
I've taken care ofher for six years...

45
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,200
but I've got a job
in Frankfurt now-

46
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,320
a rich family-

47
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,920
and I can't be bothered
with her anymore,

48
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,960
I know you hated
Tobias and Gretchen...

49
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,080
but you've got to take
their daughter just the same.

50
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,760
Get out of here.

51
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,280
Here she is!
Her name's Heidi!

52
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,200
How do you do,
Grandfather?

53
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,760
I'm very glad to see you.

54
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,840
Aren't you going to
show me our house?

55
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,640
Oh. It's a very fine house, isn't it?

56
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,120
Whew!

57
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,800
Where am I going to sleep?

58
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,840
Grandfather!
I found my bed.

59
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,920
I'll sleep on the hay.

60
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,960
But I suppose I ought
to have a sheet and coverlet.

61
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,440
I say, I suppose I ought
to have a sheet and coverlet.

62
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,800
Well...

63
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,800
I've always had
a sheet and coverlet...

64
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,320
but if there aren't any,
I could sleep under the hay.

65
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,680
Could I use these?

66
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,080
Grandfather, it's a beautiful bed.

67
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,880
Would you like to come and see?

68
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,320
Oh! Is that for me?

69
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,200
Thank you.

70
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,360
Ow.

71
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,440
Now I've got a table all my own.

72
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,800
Hello, laddie.
Is this Blind Anna's cottage?

73
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,320
- Yes. She's my grandmother.
- Thank you.

74
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,800
I do not know this Adolph Kramer,
but the village thinks...

75
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,800
the child should be
taken away from him.

76
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,160
You've just come to
Dorfli, Herr Pastor...

77
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,520
or you'd understand why.

78
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,680
They say you have known
Kramer for 50 years.

79
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,040
- What sort of a man is he?
- Who knows?

80
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,200
He was a grand young man,
except for his wild temper.

81
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,000
And his son grew up
just like him.

82
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,680
Tobias wanted to marry
a girl from Mayenfeld.

83
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,960
Adolph disliked her and forbade it,
but the boy married her...

84
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,200
just the same
and brought her home,

85
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,720
Adolph turned them away in a rage...

86
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,320
and told Tobias
never to come back...

87
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,200
until he'd given up the girl.

88
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,360
But why should the village
hate him and fear him so?

89
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,000
Feuds and weeds grow
quickly, Herr Pastor.

90
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,480
The people of the village
sided with the boy...

91
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,640
and the father cursed them...

92
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,680
and went and built himself
a hut on the mountain.

93
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,720
Since that day, he's never
spoken to a living soul.

94
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,320
Frau Anna, is the child
safe with him?

95
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,360
God knows.

96
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,000
Living alone like that
has made him a strange creature.

97
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,520
I like to hear the church bells,
don't you, Grandfather?

98
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,880
- Get to bed.
- Shall I say my prayers out here with you?

99
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,280
- I told you to go to bed!
- Yes, Grandfather.

100
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,960
I think I'll go to bed now,
Grandfather. Good night!

101
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,160
And God bless Grandfather,
and please make him like me.

102
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,320
And please make me
a good little girl. Amen.

103
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,640
And please make Aunt Dete stay
in Frankfurt for a long, long time.

104
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,000
Amen.

105
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,280
- Is this for me?
- Yes.

106
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,560
It's the most beautifulest
chair I ever saw.

107
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,560
- Thank you,
- Mm.

108
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,480
- What are you making?
- Cheese.

109
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,440
Could I help?

110
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,640
Stir.

111
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,080
Do please help me tie my apron.

112
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,400
Agh!

113
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,400
Thank you.

114
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,280
- Are these ours, Grandfather?
- Mm-hmm.

115
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,080
- What are their names?
- Swanly and Bearly.

116
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,680
You don't look much like a swan...

117
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,720
and you don't look
anything like a bear.

118
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,080
I think you're a beautiful goat.

119
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,880
I wonder if you give black milk?

120
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,360
- You can milk Bearly.
- But I don't know how to milk a goat.

121
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,000
Well, then, it's time
you learned. This way.

122
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,080
You may as well stand still.
I'm going to do it.

123
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,440
Oh, please, Swanly.
Don't be so st-

124
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,320
stubborn.

125
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,440
Oh!

126
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,960
Bearly's a very warm goat, isn't she?

127
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,000
Pretty hard work,
isn't it, Grandfather?

128
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,080
Is this the last load?

129
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,640
Not quite. The rabbit's fur
is thick. It'll be a hard winter.

130
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,080
We don't care
if it's a hard winter, do we?

131
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,120
There's wood to keep us warm
and cheese to eat...

132
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,120
and lots of hay
for Swanly and Bearly.

133
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,200
May I go with Peter today?

134
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,880
It may be the last time
before the snows.

135
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,120
All right. All right.

136
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,800
But be back early for your lessons.

137
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,320
I will.

138
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,520
Are you sure you can
get along without me?

139
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,320
I'll try.

140
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,440
- You're supposed to be asleep.
- My eyes couldn't stay shut.

141
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,600
Look what I found!

142
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,440
Well.

143
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,960
Do you think there's
any music left in it?

144
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,040
We'll see.

145
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,720
I'm afraid it's all tired out.

146
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,800
Hm.

147
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,880
Oh!

148
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,080
This looks like a wonderful story!

149
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,560
What's it about?

150
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,200
It's about magic wooden shoes.

151
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,000
All right, Grandfather, I'm ready.

152
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,880
Now...

153
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,440
a long, long time ago...

154
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,560
there was a little
Dutch girl named Netje,

155
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,160
Have you seen my new shoes

156
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,360
They are made out of wood

157
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,520
Such nice little shoes

158
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,960
Don't you think
they look good

159
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,320
I can dance all around

160
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,600
With the greatest of ease

161
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,760
I can jump from the ground

162
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,080
To the top of the trees

163
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,640
I'll tell you something
I'm going to try

164
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,440
Put on your shoes
and away we'll fly

165
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,960
We'll take a trip
wherever we choose

166
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,680
We'll dance and skip
in our little wooden shoes

167
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:47,000
How many miles
will you travel with me

168
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,480
One mile or two miles
and maybe three

169
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,320
We'll make a stop
wherever we choose

170
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,040
We'll skip and hop
in our little wooden shoes

171
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,880
Wasn't our journey
a nice holiday

172
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,680
We'll take another
some other day

173
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:35,280
We'll take a trip
wherever we choose

174
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:43,280
We'll dance and skip
in our little wooden shoes

175
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,840
- Hello.
- Oh!

176
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,240
- You come to see us?
- Yes, dear.

177
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,680
- I am Pastor Schultz.
- How do you do, Pastor Schultz?

178
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,960
How do you do, Frau Schultz?

179
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:35,000
Oh, no. I'm Fraulein Elsa,
the schoolmistress.

180
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,120
Oh, you'd make
a very nice Frau Schultz.

181
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,320
You're mending
your grandfather's coat. How nice.

182
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,160
It's his Sunday coat, but he never
wears it. He doesn't go to church.

183
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,040
Perhaps we could persuade him to go,
Would you like that?

184
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,440
The pastor and Fraulein Elsa
have come to see us. Isn't that nice?

185
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,440
- Good day, neighbor.
- Well?

186
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,320
- We've come to ask about the child.
- Go inside, Heidi.

187
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,000
Save your breath.
I have nothing to say to you.

188
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,960
- That seems to settle it.
- No, it doesn't.

189
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,560
I'm sorry to insist, neighbor,
but school will open soon.

190
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,560
- I'll not send Heidi to school.
- What will you do with her, then?

191
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,560
She will thrive up here
with the goats and the birds.

192
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,080
- What will she learn from them?
- At least she will learn no evil!

193
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,080
That's hardly enough
schooling for a child.

194
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,080
I'll teach her all that's necessary.

195
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,400
And you'll teach her religion too?

196
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,600
The mountains will teach her
the only religion worth having...

197
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,880
as I have found out.

198
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,680
Come back to Dorfli, neighbor. This is
no life up here for you and the child-

199
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,640
at enmity with God and man.

200
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,720
I know what they think of me in Dorfli,
and they know what I think of them.

201
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:00,880
- It's better that we keep apart.
- I should not like to appeal to the law.

202
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Heidi shall not go to school
or to church, either. That is final!

203
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,680
I'm sorry, neighbor.
May God help you.

204
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,760
And if any man try
to take Heidi away from me...

205
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,040
God help him,!

206
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,160
I used to go to Sunday school
when I lived in Mayenfeld.

207
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,920
Are you going to be my
Sunday school teacher too?

208
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,360
We'll have our first lesson now.

209
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,720
I'd like to read this story.
Shall I?

210
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,640
"A certain man had two sons...

211
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,040
and the...

212
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,720
Y- O-U-N-G-E-R-"

213
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,160
Younger.

214
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:17,320
"and the younger of them
said to his father...

215
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,680
'Father, give me the P-O-R-"'

216
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,680
These are pretty hard words.

217
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,680
Perhaps you'd
better help me.

218
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,160
"Give me the portion of goods
that fall unto me. "

219
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:37,000
And he divided
unto them his levy...

220
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,520
and the younger son
gathered all together...

221
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,240
and took his journey
into a far country.

222
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,280
You know this story by heart.

223
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,360
Yes. By heart.

224
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,440
Does the son ever go
home to his father?

225
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,040
And the son said...

226
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,040
"Father, I have sinned
against heaven...

227
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,880
and in thy sight...

228
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:02,640
and am no more worthy
to be called thy son. "

229
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,960
But the father said
to his servants...

230
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,480
"Bring forth the best robe,
and put it on him...

231
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,480
and put a ring on his hand
and shoes on his feet...

232
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:17,640
for this my son was dead
and is alive again.

233
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,000
He was lost...

234
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,120
and is found. "

235
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,360
"If a man have a hundred sheep...

236
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,360
and one of them be gone astray...

237
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,840
doth he not leave
the 90 and 9...

238
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,680
and goeth into
the mountains...

239
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,680
and seeketh that
which has gone astray?

240
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,280
And if-"

241
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,880
Peter, what is it?

242
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,760
The grandfather and Heidi
have come to church.

243
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,520
"And if so be that he find it...

244
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,200
verily, I say unto you...

245
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,200
he rejoiceth more of that sheep...

246
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:37,680
than of the 90 and 9
which went not astray. "

247
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:52,960
Holy God we praise thy name

248
00:30:53,080 --> 00:31:02,440
Lord of all
we bow before thee

249
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:11,960
All on earth
thy scepter claim

250
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:21,520
All in heaven above
adore thee

251
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:31,000
Fill the heavens
with sweet accord

252
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:41,800
Holy, holy holy, Lord

253
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,760
Holy

254
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:53,680
Holy, holy Lord

255
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,520
Good day, Adolph.

256
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,560
Good day.

257
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,720
Good to see you and the child.

258
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,280
You're looking well.

259
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,320
Here comes the grandfather now.

260
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,240
So the old eagle
has come down from his perch.

261
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,320
It was lonely for Heidi.

262
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,280
Adolph, you're an old fraud.

263
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,680
Don't give me away.

264
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,320
Well-

265
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:26,000
I ask the Herr Pastor to forgive
the words I said on the mountain.

266
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,520
The words are forgotten, neighbor.
This is a happy day for all of us.

267
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,520
I hope we shall
see you here often.

268
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,240
- What do you say, Heidi?
- Well, I think everybody...

269
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,360
really ought to
go to church on Sunday...

270
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,440
and I think there
ought to be a Frau Schultz.

271
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,480
Aunt Dete, what-
what do you want here?

272
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,440
Where's your grandfather?

273
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:15,000
He's up on the mountain
cutting some logs.

274
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,920
Get on your coat and mittens.
We're going away.

275
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,880
I don't want to go away!

276
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,680
- What?
- I want to stay here.

277
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,640
I love the grandfather,
and he loves me.

278
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,280
It's my birthday,
and we're going to have a party.

279
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,120
Look. He made me
these for a present.

280
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,200
There's Swanly and Bearly. And we're going
down to the village to get sausage and butter...

281
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,200
because the grandmother
and Peter are coming.

282
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,760
Well, he won't mind you
going on a little trip with me.

283
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,560
- Where?
- Just to Frankfurt.

284
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,640
You can come back
whenever you like.

285
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,040
- I don't want to go to Frankfurt.
- You will do as I say!

286
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,080
- Where are your clothes?
- I've got to ask the grandfather first.

287
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,080
- Where are they?
- In there.

288
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,440
Now, there is nothing
to worry about.

289
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:04,840
We'll have a sleigh ride to Mayenfeld
and a nice trip on a train.

290
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,360
And I'll buy you a present
for your birthday.

291
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,680
- Can I come right back for my party?
- Didn't I tell you you could?

292
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,680
Can I bring some soft rolls
for the grandmother?

293
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,240
You see, she hasn't many teeth
and can't eat her black bread.

294
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,640
Oh, yes. Come!
Hurry up! Hurry up!

295
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,160
First, I must go up the mountain
and tell the grandfather where I'm going.

296
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,440
There isn't time. We might miss our train!
I'll send word back to him!

297
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,480
But I'd rather tell him myself.

298
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:36,040
Do you think if I put
my birthday shoes by the fire...

299
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,240
- he'd know I'm coming back?
- Yes, yes, of course.

300
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,360
Now, come along!

301
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,680
Heidi?

302
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,760
Heidi?

303
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,600
Heidi!

304
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,000
Heidi! Where are you?

305
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,680
- Good day, little Heidi.
- Good day, Herr Pastor.

306
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,000
- Are you going away?
- Yes, to Frankfurt with Aunt Dete.

307
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,520
I'm taking her for a little trip,
Herr Pastor. It's her birthday.

308
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:01,200
- Oh, how kind of you. Pleasant journey to you, Fraulein.
- Thank you.

309
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,640
Oh, there's the grandfather.
I must go tell him.

310
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:12,040
- Sit down! Drive on!
- Grandfather!

311
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,640
Have you seen her?
Heidi! She's gone!

312
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,640
Don't you know?
Her aunt has taken her to Frankfurt.

313
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,800
She's stolen her!
Where are they?

314
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,880
Stolen? There.

315
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,480
Heidi!

316
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,840
- I don't think I'll go any farther.
- Oh, yes, you will.

317
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,440
Aunt Dete, tell them to stop!

318
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,960
Keep quiet.
I can't stop the train.

319
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,480
You've got to. It's getting late.
I'll never get back tonight!

320
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:27,040
Of course you won't.
Sit down and keep still.

321
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,880
- Then you-you knew all the time?
- Well, what if I did?

322
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,320
There's going to be
sausage and butter at my party...

323
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,800
and I won't be there.

324
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,720
And- And the grandfather
will be lonely.

325
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,920
Do you remember
what I told you?

326
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,080
I'm to say to the lady...

327
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,240
"How do you do,
Fraulein Rottenmeier?"

328
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,400
And to Klara,
"How do you do, Fraulein Klara?

329
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,400
I hope you will
be well soon. "

330
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,720
But why are we going
to their house?

331
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,240
You'll find out
when we get there.

332
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,840
"The quality of
a young lady's breeding...

333
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,320
is indicated by her deportment
when elders are present.

334
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,680
At such times, her manner
should be sedate and diffident. "

335
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,160
It's time for them
to be here, Fraulein.

336
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,520
Remember, Klara,
no excitement.

337
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,520
You're still an invalid.

338
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,840
"The habit of interruption...

339
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,840
should always be frowned upon.

340
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:30,160
The well-bred young lady always
waits until her elders are silent. "

341
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,560
I wonder what she'll be like.

342
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,960
Your father expects a healthy,
unspoiled, mountain child...

343
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,360
of your age
to share your studies.

344
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,800
Personally, I think
the whole plan is a mistake.

345
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,720
Papa thought it might be good
for me to have a playmate.

346
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,880
But you have me.

347
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,680
Don't I give you my entire
time and devotion?

348
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,680
Yes, and it's very kind of you...

349
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,000
but I don't have much fun.

350
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,960
Whoa!

351
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,520
Now, remember.

352
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,600
My word!

353
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,680
Well, come on.

354
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,200
Announce us.

355
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,600
Where did you
pick up that?

356
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,880
- That is my niece.
- How unfortunate for the poor child.

357
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,200
Are you the king here?
You look like a king.

358
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,160
Ah, little fraulein, if only
the rest of the world...

359
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,800
could see through your eyes.

360
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,360
Hmm, quite a personage...

361
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,080
under that extraordinary hat.

362
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,040
They are here, Fraulein.

363
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,240
- Andrews, what is she like?
- Highly intelligent.

364
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:09,800
- Don't be misled by the hat.
- Show them in,

365
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,960
How do you do,
Fraulein Rottenmeier?

366
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,200
- What is your name?
- Heidi.

367
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,440
Heidi?
Ridiculous.

368
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,040
What name did they give
you when you were baptized?

369
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,240
I don't remember that.

370
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,600
Are you being impudent?

371
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,320
No, Fraulein.
She didn't understand.

372
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,600
- She was baptized Adelheid.
- Hmm.

373
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:53,360
She looks too young.
How old is she?

374
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,000
She's older than she appears.
She's nearly 11.

375
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,440
Aunt Dete doesn't tell the truth.

376
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:03,800
I'm eight years old today.

377
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,080
Grandfather was going to
give me a birthday party.

378
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,080
How far have you
gone in school?

379
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,160
I've never gone at all.

380
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,400
How do you do, Fraulein Klara?
I hope you will be well soon.

381
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,400
Not fraulein. I'm just Klara,
and I'll call you Heidi.

382
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,240
- Why do you sit in that chair with wheels?
- I can't walk.

383
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,560
I fell last summer and hurt my back.

384
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:48,000
That's when Fraulein Rottenmeier
came to take care of me.

385
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:52,000
Then you couldn't climb the mountain
with Goat Peter, Swanly and Bearly.

386
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,520
Who are they?
Are they friends of yours?

387
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,280
Yes. They're
the grandfather's goats...

388
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,200
and Peter, he's the goat general.

389
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,680
Oh, tell me about them.

390
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,000
That's enough! You will take
that impossible child back!

391
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,160
You'll have to give me
more expense money then...

392
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,400
and the 50 marks
Herr Sesemann promised.

393
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,160
You dare to speak
to me like that?

394
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,760
- I'll not give you one pfennig!
- You'd better.

395
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,200
I've brought just the kind of child
Herr Sesemann asked for...

396
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,360
unless you have
your own reasons for not wanting her.

397
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,160
Get out, and take your
wretched niece with you!

398
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,120
All right, but you'll
give me the money...

399
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,520
or I'll write to Herr Sesemann.

400
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,840
You think I don't know
what your little game is?

401
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,360
A rich widower and his sick child.

402
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,520
You don't want Klara
to get well... not yet...

403
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,520
not until
you've made him think...

404
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,680
his little darling
can't live without you.

405
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,360
Now you can get rid of
the "impossible child" yourself!.

406
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,920
Sell her to the Gypsies,
for all I care!

407
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,040
I'm afraid the grandfather
will be worried.

408
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,480
He didn't know I was going away,
so I must go back tomorrow.

409
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,520
- Didn't Dete tell you?
- What?

410
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,160
- That you're to live here with me,
- No, she didn't tell me.

411
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,440
You see, my mama's dead, and my papa's
business keeps him in Paris most of the time.

412
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:08,400
- And I haven't anyone to play with.
- I can't live here!

413
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,720
I'm going back to the
grandfather right away!

414
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,960
- Indeed, you are.
- No, I like her!

415
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,960
Andrews will take you home
in the morning.

416
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,880
- No, I want her to stay!
- That is for me to decide.

417
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:22,520
- I know what is best for you, Klara.
- No! No! Papa sent for her, and you've got to wait till he comes home!

418
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,480
Klara, you're not strong enough for this
excitement. You'll make yourself ill.

419
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,880
Yes, I will, I know I will
if you don't let me keep Heidi!

420
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,920
- But, Klara, I can't stay!
- Quiet, dear.

421
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,520
Quiet. Remember what
a sick little girl you are.

422
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,760
You do want me to get well,
don't you, Fraulein?

423
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,120
- How can you ask?
- Then- Then please let me keep Heidi.

424
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:49,480
- Very well. For the present.
- You can't keep me here!

425
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,720
The grandfather is waiting.
He doesn't know where I am!

426
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:55,320
Dinner is served.

427
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,320
You'll like it here, Heidi.

428
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,880
We'll have such
good times together.

429
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,560
And Fraulein can send word
to your grandfather.

430
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,080
No, no! Aunt Dete
must take me home!

431
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,280
Dinner is waiting.
We will attend to that tomorrow.

432
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,000
- Then it's all right? I can go?
- I said in the morning, Adelheid.

433
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,880
Adelheid...

434
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,960
I am waiting.

435
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,760
For what we are
about to receive...

436
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,720
the Lord make us
truly thankful.

437
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,520
God bless Grandfather
and Swanly and Bearly...

438
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,720
and please make me
a good little girl.

439
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,400
- Amen.
- Ha!

440
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,120
You may serve.

441
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:19,440
Remember, Klara, only a little,

442
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:36,160
- Must you hoard your food, Adelheid?
- It's for the grandmother.

443
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,520
I'm going to take it
home with me tomorrow.

444
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,680
Put it back.

445
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,080
- What's that?
- It's technically known as false hare.

446
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,720
I think you'll find it rather tasty.
Will you serve yourself?

447
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:55,240
I think I'd rather
just have some cheese.

448
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:01,320
Evidently our little friend
has no idea of table manners.

449
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,520
Bring me the tray, Andrews.

450
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,520
Now watch, Adelheid.

451
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,880
This is the way
civilized people serve themselves,

452
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,920
Stop!

453
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,920
Oh, dear, what a pity.

454
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,600
You may go.

455
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,840
This is not humorous.

456
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,080
You are not in your barbarous hut
in the Alps now, but in a cultured home.

457
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:52,440
Adelheid,!

458
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,680
Did I actually see you yawn?

459
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,600
- I'm horrified!
- Don't scold her.

460
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,200
She's had such a hard day.

461
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,720
I am trying
to be patient, Klara.

462
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,880
But it is the height of impropriety
to yawn at the dinner table.

463
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,920
Ayawn at any time
is a sign of disrespect...

464
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,040
and lack of control,

465
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,840
It shows
the attention is wandering...

466
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,560
and that the young person is not
interested in the improvement of her mind.

467
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:24,920
Oh!

468
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,200
Why, it's really more
than it's worth.

469
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,560
- You're going for the child?
- I am.

470
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,880
You're not walking all the way
to Frankfurt? It's over 100 miles.

471
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,640
- I shall get there.
- Let us lend you enough railway fare.

472
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,640
That's kind of you, Franz...

473
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,640
but my legs will carry me.

474
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,640
I have money to bring us
back on the train.

475
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,000
- Auf Wiedersehen. - Good luck,
Adolph. - Godspeed to you, neighbor.

476
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,480
Well, Little Miss Hasty Pudding.

477
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,200
I heard Goat Peter's horn.
He must be looking for me.

478
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:56,160
- Goat Peter?
- Yes. There. Don't you hear it?

479
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:00,000
I say, it's a little chilly outside
for this sort of thing, isn't it?

480
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,640
Let's try the window. Come on.

481
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:17,160
Fresh fish!
Fresh fish!

482
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,480
Oh, it isn't Goat Peter at all.
It's only fresh fish.

483
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,480
You'd better get dressed,
little fraulein.

484
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,560
Breakfast will be soon.

485
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:34,000
Well, I never thought I'd
turn out to be a lady's maid.

486
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:39,440
There.
Hurry up.

487
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,920
Breakfast in 10 minutes,
Adelheid.

488
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,200
We insist on punctuality
in this household.

489
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,080
"Punctuality. "

490
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,200
Don't dawdle.

491
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,880
"Adelheid-"

492
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,600
- Well, I-
- Shh!

493
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:21,400
It is the height of punctuality
to yawn at the dinner table.

494
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,200
Isn't Heidi the funniest little thing?

495
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,360
I'm so glad she's going to stay.

496
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,720
- Is she?
- Yes, but she doesn't know it.

497
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,560
The poor dear thinks
she's going home today.

498
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,400
But she'll be happier here.
Don't you think so?

499
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,400
I'll have some new
dresses made for her.

500
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,400
Do you think you
could manage a new hat?

501
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,800
Oh, Heidi!

502
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:47,560
It's lovely!

503
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:51,080
I wonder where Aunt Dete is.
It's time we started.

504
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,560
Oh, uh, don't think
about that now.

505
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:57,080
We're going to have our lessons
with Fraulein in a minute.

506
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:00,080
Well, maybe I could
just this once...

507
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,160
if there's time.

508
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,160
I'll be sorry to leave you.

509
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,160
I hope you begin
to walk soon...

510
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,680
and not have to
sit in that chair.

511
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,680
Fraulein says perhaps
I'll never walk again.

512
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,680
Well, Goat Peter said
I'd never learn to read...

513
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:18,360
but the grandfather
told me I could, and I did.

514
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:24,840
Your back feels just like mine.

515
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,680
And your legs do too.

516
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:32,000
I should think you could walk
if you wanted to enough.

517
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,480
- Why don't you try?
- Oh, I wouldn't dare.

518
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:37,000
- Why not?
- I might fall.

519
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,640
Lean on me.
I'm pretty strong.

520
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,160
Do you really think
I could walk?

521
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:44,680
We'll try, then we'd find out.

522
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:47,000
Come on,
put your hand on me.

523
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,640
No, no, I can't!

524
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,160
- Don't ever tell Fraulein!
- I won't.

525
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,280
- What's that?
- A monkey.

526
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,120
I'd better let her in.
She's sitting in the snow.

527
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,080
Oh, Fraulein
wouldn't like it.

528
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:17,240
She wouldn't want her
to catch cold.

529
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,960
Besides, I've never
met a monkey. Have you?

530
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,040
No. Not to speak to.

531
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,880
Oh, she says she's very cold.

532
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:33,080
Come on! Come on!

533
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,280
How are you?

534
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:45,600
She has very nice manners.

535
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:49,480
Fraulein Rottenmeier
would like you. Come on.

536
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:57,400
Doorbell when the hall's
being washed down!

537
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,800
- I want-a Louise.
- You want what?

538
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:04,320
- Louise, a-my monkey.
- Monkey? You've been misinformed.

539
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,800
This is not the zoo!

540
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,960
You'd make
a very nice schoolteacher.

541
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,600
She wants you to name
the principal rivers of Europe.

542
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:01,600
I'm afraid that's too hard.
Can't you ask me something easier?

543
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:13,920
If you young ladies have finished with
you vulgar display of lack of restraint...

544
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,120
we will begin our lessons.

545
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,600
Andrews! Andrews!
Help! Help!

546
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,360
Did you call?

547
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,880
Take that thing
out of here!

548
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,800
My word. A gorilla!

549
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,200
Well, don't stand there
fiddle-faddy.

550
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,200
Take that beast out of here!

551
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,960
This is no laughing matter!

552
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:47,040
Yes, uh, scat,!
Do you mind? Scat,!

553
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,680
Aah!

554
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,720
Get him off!.
Get him off!.

555
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,240
Oh, oh, oh!

556
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:11,400
- Oh, I'm most awfully sorry. This is most undignified.
- How dare you!

557
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:15,640
This is really not my fault.
Can I help you up at all? There we go!

558
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,720
Well!

559
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,560
Get him out ofhere,!

560
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,800
Oh, my God!

561
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,760
You might try putting
salt on her tail.

562
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,880
- Ah, what we need is strategy.
- Can I get it for you?

563
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,480
No, thank you.
I think I've got it.

564
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,480
Now the rest of you draw fire.

565
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,760
I'll attack from the rear.

566
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,560
Come here, little monkey!

567
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:54,120
come here,!
come,! come,!

568
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,920
- Come on! Come on!
- Here, monkey!

569
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:06,920
This has gone far enough!

570
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,480
Come on in.

571
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,080
Louise! Louise!

572
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:22,160
- She'll come down now. Here's your papa.
- Come, Louise.

573
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:28,080
Better get out quickly
before she finds her tongue.

574
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:33,240
- Here you are.
- What's the matter with you?

575
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,600
- Who let that beast in?
- I did.

576
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,600
- But she was so cold out in the snow.
- That's no concern of ours.

577
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:47,240
Please, Fraulein, it was
my fault as much as hers.

578
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:50,760
Such conduct is inexcusable!
She shall be punished severely!

579
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,760
Don't you touch her!
I'll write Papa!

580
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:55,600
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.
Don't excite yourself.

581
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,600
I'd forgotten it might upset you.

582
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:00,920
Adelheid, you shall spend
the rest of the day in your room.

583
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,720
I can't do that.
Aunt Dete is going to take me home.

584
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,800
Your aunt went away
this morning.

585
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,680
She... went away?

586
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,720
But she's coming back.

587
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:15,280
- No, she's not. I discharged her.
- But she's got to take me home!

588
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,160
I'm afraid not.
She cares nothing about you.

589
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,840
- She told me to sell you to the Gypsies.
- Oh, Fraulein, don't.

590
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:25,840
I doubt whether you will
ever see your Aunt Dete again.

591
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:01,360
- What does this mean?
- You mustn't stop me!

592
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,440
What have you got
in that hat?

593
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:08,320
- Oh. So you were running away.
- I wasn't running away.

594
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,440
I was just
going home by myself.

595
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:15,000
- Andrews, throw these rolls in the dustbin.
- Oh, no.

596
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,800
They're for the grandmother.
She can't eat her black bread.

597
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,960
Throw that wretched hat
in the dustbin too.

598
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:23,280
Oh, no. Not my hat.
I need that to go home.

599
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,800
That is all, Andrews.

600
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,440
If you stop me, I'll run away again!
I can't stay here!

601
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:33,440
There aren't any pine trees
or any mountains!

602
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:35,920
The grandfather doesn't
know where I am!

603
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,120
- You've got to let me go!
- Stop this nonsense!

604
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,280
You're not going home
until I send you!

605
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,480
Now you march upstairs!

606
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:48,400
You leave your room again
today, you'll be whipped!

607
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:10,280
Come on, little fraulein.
Keep the chin up.

608
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,160
Here's your precious bonnet.

609
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,080
Don't you think we ought to put it
under the bed to avoid the dustbin?

610
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,960
Try and cheer her up,
dear, will you?

611
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,640
Oh, Heidi, I-

612
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,520
I didn't know you wanted
to go home so much.

613
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,600
But you mustn't
run away again.

614
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:34,960
- Promise you won't.
- Oh, no. I couldn't promise.

615
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,040
You must, Heidi.

616
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:39,280
Papa's coming home
for Christmas.

617
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,280
That's only two weeks more.

618
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:44,440
If- If you still
feel homesick then...

619
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:47,120
I'll ask him
to send you back.

620
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:50,480
Are you sure he will?

621
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:53,080
Oh, yes.
He'll do it for me.

622
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:56,640
I won't run away.

623
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,200
I promise.

624
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:09,080
Come in.

625
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,600
I'm all new
to meet Klara's papa.

626
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:17,760
And, I must say, very impressive.

627
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,080
And just look at this!

628
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,240
I was hoping for a new hat.

629
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,240
But I'm not going
to wear my new clothes...

630
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,240
- when I go home tonight.
- No?

631
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:27,240
The grandfather
might not know me.

632
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:29,080
You're going to leave us
tonight, are you?

633
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:31,480
Yes. Klara's gonna ask
her papa to send me.

634
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:35,080
He'll be here in a few moments, and I've
come to tell you that when you meet him...

635
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,600
you're to say, "How do
you do, gracious sir?"

636
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,280
- And make him a little curtsy.
- What's that?

637
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:44,080
Well, it's uh-

638
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:47,840
That's a funny way
to say how do you do.

639
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,360
I daresay, but don't you think
you ought to practice it?

640
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:54,920
How do you do,
gracious sir?

641
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:57,080
Yes, I think
that ought to do.

642
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:14,040
A merry Christmas
to you, sir.

643
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:16,080
- Merry Christmas to you, Andrews.
- Thank you, sir.

644
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,520
- Everything all right?
- Oh, yes, sir. Quite all right.

645
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,600
Quite all right.

646
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:26,160
- Merry Christmas, Karl.
- Merry Christmas to you, sir.

647
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:28,360
Welcome, Herr Sesemann.

648
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,520
Oh, thank you,
Fraulein Rottenmeier.

649
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:33,360
- How is Klara?
- As well as may be expected...

650
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,400
considering what
we've been through.

651
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,640
I didn't want
to disturb you by writing...

652
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:40,880
- but the child Dete brought is impossible.
- Indeed!

653
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:45,880
Her manners are dreadful, and she excites
Klara to do things beyond her strength.

654
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,080
I've been seriously worried.

655
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:51,760
I'm sorry to hear that.
Why didn't you send the girl away?

656
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:54,760
Klara took an absurd fancy
to the child...

657
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,840
and I hadn't
the heart to cross her.

658
01:02:56,920 --> 01:03:00,280
You know I'm foolishly fond
of dear Klara.

659
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:03,320
But I hope you'll act immediately
for the sake of Klara's health.

660
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:06,960
- Papa, Papa, I'm waiting,!
- Coming, dear.

661
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,480
We will discuss this later, Fraulein.

662
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:14,840
- Oh, Papa, I'm so glad to see you.
- Oh, darling.

663
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:20,800
Klara, what has happened?
I expected-

664
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:23,080
That is, Fraulein told me-

665
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:25,960
But you haven't looked so well
since your accident.

666
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:28,680
Of course.
Because I've been so happy.

667
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:33,000
- It's Heidi. My little companion.
- Heidi?

668
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:36,240
Thank you a thousand times
for letting me have her.

669
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:40,280
But Fraulein seems to think
she excites you beyond your strength.

670
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:45,120
I like to be excited, and she makes
something funny happen all the time.

671
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:48,560
Oh, Papa, she's
the dearest little thing.

672
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:52,680
Well, my darling, something
has had an amazing effect on you.

673
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:56,320
I didn't have much
to look forward to before.

674
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,800
Now when I wake up,
I think...

675
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:02,120
"I'm going to spend
the day with Heidi!"

676
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:05,600
I don't see why
Fraulein doesn't like her.

677
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:08,720
Nor I. It's very odd.

678
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:15,400
This, sir, is Fraulein Heidi.

679
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:19,560
How do you do, Heidi?

680
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,720
How do you do, Sir Gracious?

681
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:30,240
I didn't do it very well.
Shall I try it again?

682
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:33,400
I don't think that
could be improved upon.

683
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,920
We're going in to the
Christmas tree in a minute.

684
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,920
You'll never guess
what your present is, will he, Heidi?

685
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,920
Let me see. Is it animal,
vegetable or mineral?

686
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,760
Well, I suppose
it's sort of animal.

687
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:48,240
I know. It's a Shetland pony.

688
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:58,760
We're ready for the
ceremony, Herr Sesemann.

689
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:01,040
Come on, Sir Gracious!

690
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:07,000
Here we go.

691
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:09,840
Remember, don't excite yourself.
You'll tire easily.

692
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:11,920
Yes, Fraulein.

693
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:30,200
Silent night

694
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:33,040
Holy night

695
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:35,720
All is calm

696
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:38,440
All is bright

697
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:43,880
Round yon Virgin
Mother and Child

698
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:49,440
Holy Infant,
so tender and mild

699
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:55,080
Sleep in heavenly peace

700
01:05:55,200 --> 01:06:00,600
Sleep in heavenly peace

701
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:03,320
Silent night

702
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:06,160
Holy night

703
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,880
All is calm

704
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,520
All is bright

705
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:16,880
Round yon virgin
Mother and child

706
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:22,360
Holy Infant,
so tender and mild

707
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:33,760
Sleep in heavenly peace

708
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:36,600
Silent night

709
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:39,240
Holy night

710
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:41,960
All is calm

711
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:44,800
All is bright

712
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:50,280
Round yon Virgin
Mother and Child

713
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:55,640
Holy Infant
so tender and mild

714
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:01,320
Sleep in heavenly peace

715
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:06,520
Sleep in heavenly peace

716
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,200
Lovely, Heidi! Lovely.

717
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,240
Merry Christmas
to you all...

718
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:19,360
and thank you for another
year's faithful service.

719
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,720
Our Christmas greetings to you,
sir, and Fraulein Klara.

720
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:24,200
A long life
and good health to you both.

721
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:27,360
- Thank you, Andrews.
- We're very grateful, sir.

722
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,520
- Karl.
- Thank you, sir.

723
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:31,680
- Fritz.
- Thank you very much, sir.

724
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,360
- Merry Christmas, Frieda.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

725
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:37,360
We'll wait till
we've had our presents.

726
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:41,160
He thinks it's going
to be an animal.

727
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:44,760
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you, sir.

728
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:46,880
For your Christmas,
Fraulein. And thank you...

729
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,680
for the efficient management
of my household.

730
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:53,200
Thank you, Herr Sesemann.
I've always felt like a mother to Klara.

731
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:56,000
Now, Papa,
my present to Heidi first.

732
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:59,520
- Oh, Klara. Your back.
- Oh.

733
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:01,680
I forgot.

734
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,800
That one, Papa.

735
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:11,680
- Happy Christmas to you, my dear.
- Thank you.

736
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:23,120
To Klara,
from her doting papa.

737
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:32,240
Turn it upside down,
then right-side up, Heidi.

738
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:43,000
It's the grandfather's house!

739
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:46,440
He's bringing in the wood.

740
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,520
Can I keep it for always?

741
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:50,600
Longer than that.

742
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:53,800
Oh! Heidi, look!

743
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:58,640
- Oh!
- It's lovely.

744
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:01,120
Now it's my turn.
I don't see...

745
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:03,400
my Shetland pony
around anywhere.

746
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:05,880
Shall we give him
his present now?

747
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,240
You hold my doll, Fraulein.

748
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,040
Now watch, Papa.
You stand over there.

749
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:27,360
- Don't be afraid.
- I'm not.

750
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,800
- Klara, stop!
- Wait!

751
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:42,720
Lean on me
until you get started.

752
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:51,240
Now, try hard.

753
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:12,720
Merry Christmas, Papa.

754
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:14,840
Oh, my darling.

755
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:17,240
My darling child.

756
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:44,880
They told me
you might never walk again.

757
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,560
- How did you? How did it happen?
- Heidi taught me.

758
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:51,000
Heidi-

759
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:55,880
I was afraid,
but she made me try.

760
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,080
We did a little more
every day.

761
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:01,080
You dear child,
you've worked a miracle.

762
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,160
Oh, no. It was the grandfather.

763
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:05,680
Goat Peter said
I'd never learn to read...

764
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,720
but the grandfather said
I could if I wanted to...

765
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,880
and I did.

766
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,160
So I thought Klara
could walk if she wanted to...

767
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:14,160
and she did.

768
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:17,480
You've given me the happiest
Christmas of my life.

769
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:21,160
And I've had a nice
Christmas present too.

770
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:23,160
Shall I get ready
to go home now?

771
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:25,680
No. I have another
Christmas present for you-

772
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,920
a home with us
as long as you live.

773
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:31,160
- No. I couldn't do that.
- Why not?

774
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,240
The grandfather's
been waiting for me...

775
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:35,280
such a long time.

776
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:39,160
Oh, Heidi, I hoped
you wouldn't want to go now.

777
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:44,720
Yes, I'd like to be that...

778
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:47,640
but I've got to go home.

779
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:52,000
Papa, I told Heidi you'd
let her go if she wanted to.

780
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:55,520
But you don't understand, dear.
You'll be my own daughter.

781
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:58,320
You'll have clothes like Klara's...

782
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:00,520
everything just like hers...

783
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,520
and grow up to be a great lady.

784
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:05,440
- Now, wouldn't you like that?
- No, thank you.

785
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:07,760
I want to go home
to my grandfather.

786
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:11,360
- I can't let you do that.
- But Klara promised!

787
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:16,120
- I- - I'm sorry, Heidi.
Someday you'll understand.

788
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:25,920
Papa, I did promise
you'd send her home.

789
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:30,240
But dear, you don't know
what her grandfather's like.

790
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:32,560
Dete told me that he was
a very brutal man...

791
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:34,560
feared by everyone.

792
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:38,480
No, Heidi will be
much happier here with us.

793
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:46,320
You!
You've spoiled everything!

794
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,480
Don't break
my snowstorm!

795
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,120
Fraulein Rottenmeier,!

796
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:57,680
What is
the meaning of this?

797
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:00,320
Forgive me, Herr Sesemann,
I- I was beyond myself.

798
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:04,360
You must realize I cannot
have you longer in my employ.

799
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:06,920
- Yes, Herr Sesemann.
- I'll give you a month's salary.

800
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,840
You will arrange
to leave tomorrow.

801
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:23,120
Grandfather.

802
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:25,960
Grandfather.

803
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:29,680
I'll never see you again.

804
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:06,280
- Looking for somebody?
- My granddaughter.

805
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,440
You might find her
at the theater.

806
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:12,280
Every youngster in town tries
to get there on Christmas day.

807
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:15,640
Yes. She might be there.
Thank you.

808
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:25,280
- What is it, Grandpa?
- I'm looking for my granddaughter.

809
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:29,120
- But you can't go inside.
- I must see if she's here.

810
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:31,120
Sorry, sir.
The performance is just over.

811
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,120
You better wait over there.

812
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:35,440
All right.

813
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:54,440
Santa Claus!

814
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:59,480
- Santa Claus!
- Santa Claus!

815
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:10,560
Santa Claus!

816
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:13,560
Oh, Heidi, see the funny
Santa Claus over there?

817
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:14,880
Where? I can't see.

818
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,880
Papa, please take us
over to see him.

819
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,800
We better not, dear. You've had
too much excitement for one day.

820
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:25,120
- But Heidi hasn't seen him.
- Never mind. I don't care.

821
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:30,400
Heidi!
Heidi, where are you?

822
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,720
It's the grandfather
calling me!

823
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:35,200
It couldn't be
your grandfather, Heidi.

824
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:37,760
It sounded just like him.

825
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:43,400
You must be mistaken, dear. Your grandfather
is 100 miles away on his mountain.

826
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:47,200
I'm almost sure I heard him.
I know it was his voice!

827
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:51,360
Grandfather! Grandfather!
Where are you?

828
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:54,400
Heidi! Heidi!

829
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,960
Whoa!

830
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:17,200
Don't you worry.
That wasn't your grandfather.

831
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,800
Heidi!
Heidi!

832
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:33,560
- Heidi!
- What do you want?

833
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:35,640
I thought this
was the sleigh.

834
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,720
It must be the right street.

835
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,800
Heidi!

836
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:41,840
Schutzmann,

837
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:45,000
That old fellow is acting very strangely.
I think you'd better keep an eye on him.

838
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:55,160
Is my granddaughter here?
A child named Heidi.

839
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:59,120
Your granddaughter?
It isn't likely.

840
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:01,120
I'll see for myself!.

841
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:03,400
Come here!
What are you doing here?

842
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:07,080
I'm looking for my granddaughter.
She may be in this house!

843
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,440
- Come! Come!
- You better come with us.

844
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:15,080
She's in one of these houses.
I'll not leave till I find her!

845
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:19,440
- What is this?
- You can't disturb people!

846
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:24,080
Herr Wachtmeister,
I heard her cry out from the sleigh.

847
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:26,080
I tell you,
she's in some trouble.

848
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:30,200
We can't have you beating on
all the doors of Frankfurt at this hour!

849
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:33,920
- I must find her.
- Of course. Of course.

850
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:36,240
But she can come
to no harm tonight.

851
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:40,160
If you're still worried in the morning,
we'll investigate your story.

852
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:42,800
I tell you,
I must find her tonight!

853
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:47,960
- Lock him up.
- The cells are full, Herr Wachtmeister.

854
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,920
Naturally, naturally.
Christmas night.

855
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:53,760
- Put him in the detention room then.
- But, Herr Wachtmeister-

856
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:55,960
Take him away.

857
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,800
Stop that.

858
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:10,040
Christmas comes
but once a year

859
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:12,360
Ja, and with it
comes too much beer.

860
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:17,200
christmas comes
but once a year

861
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:19,880
With it comes
too much beer

862
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:54,520
Heidi. Get up.

863
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,800
And be very quiet.

864
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:59,520
Why? What's the matter?

865
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:02,040
We're going away.

866
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:05,120
Oh, is it morning already,
and you're going to take me home?

867
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:07,640
Yes, that's it.
We're going home.

868
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:09,800
But I thought Andrews
was going to take me.

869
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:14,200
Shh. He can't. You're to go
with me. Now dress quickly.

870
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:25,360
If You are
a just and merciful God...

871
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:27,640
then help me...

872
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:30,480
in this hour in my need.

873
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,640
Hurry up!

874
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:36,960
But first I must go and say good-bye
to Klara and her papa.

875
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:40,640
No, you can't disturb them so early.
I said good-bye for you.

876
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:42,720
Oh, wait. I forgot.

877
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:46,880
Don't do that again!

878
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:03,320
Heidi! Heidi!

879
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,680
I'll put a stop to that.

880
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:28,160
Ah, let the poor chap
enjoy his Christmas.

881
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:33,320
Why, it isn't
morning at all.

882
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:36,160
- It's still night.
- Shh! It's a long way.

883
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:38,200
You've got to catch
an early train.

884
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:54,720
- This isn't the right way!
- I know what I'm doing!

885
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:57,000
I don't think I'll go with you.
I'll wait for Andrews.

886
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,160
He will have to find you first.

887
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:08,760
Let me go!
Let me go!

888
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:29,760
- This is the child.
- Ah.

889
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:31,920
Nice little girl.

890
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:35,760
Let me go!
I want my grandfather!

891
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:38,240
- You'll never see your grandfather again.
- Come on!

892
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:40,960
Come on.
Ayyy!

893
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:47,160
- Heidi! Heidi!
- Grandfather,! Grandfather,!

894
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:50,000
Grandfather!
Grandfather!

895
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:52,640
- Heidi!
- Grandfather,!

896
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:53,960
Grandfather,
she's hurting me!

897
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,800
Grandfather,
take me home!

898
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,560
What happened?
What's the matter?

899
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:10,600
That old man stole my child.

900
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:12,160
Hey, you! Stop!

901
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:15,160
Stop!

902
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:26,760
- They've stolen my sled.
- Who owns this one?

903
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,880
- I do.
- Get in, and follow that man.

904
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,880
- What happened?
- Stolen sleigh!

905
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,520
Follow that man
with the child!

906
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:49,560
Stop!

907
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:53,880
Stop, or I'll shoot!

908
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:56,360
Whoa!

909
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:59,320
You broke out of jail.

910
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:01,960
You took a sled that
did not belong to you.

911
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,000
You stole that child,!

912
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:05,680
- He didn't steal me!
- I tell you, she's mine!

913
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:07,560
Silence!

914
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:09,400
Herr Captain,
we have found the woman.

915
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,920
Good. Bring her in.

916
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:14,400
- Is this your child?
- Yes, Herr Captain.

917
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:15,800
No, I'm not!

918
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:18,800
Is this the man who struck you
and took her away from you?

919
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:21,240
- Yes.
- She's lying!

920
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:25,160
I don't know who she is or what
she's doing, but Heidi is mine!

921
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:27,760
That's enough!
You will be held for trial.

922
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:29,680
You stupid fools!

923
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:33,240
- Can't you see what you're doing?
- Lock him up,!

924
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:36,480
You can't! You're not going
to take her away from me again!

925
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:39,000
No! No, you mustn't
take him away!

926
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:43,080
He's telling the truth!
He is my grandfather.

927
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:46,760
My really and truly grandfather!
Please! Please let him go!

928
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:48,760
- Come on! Don't be hysterical.
- Grandfather!

929
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:51,400
We'll want you for the trial,
Take your child home,

930
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:54,240
I am not her child!
She's a bad lady!

931
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:56,320
She tried to sell me
to the Gypsies!

932
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:59,320
Please.

933
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:01,640
Please let the grandfather
take me home.

934
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:04,080
He didn't mean
to do anything bad.

935
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,480
I'll work hard and pay back
for everything he broke.

936
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:09,520
- So will Swanly and Bearly.
- Pay no attention to her.

937
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:11,600
She'll be all right
when I get her to bed.

938
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:14,400
I won't go with her!
She broke my snowstorm...

939
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:18,520
and sent my Aunt Dete away so she
couldn't take me home to the mountains!

940
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:22,840
If you don't believe me
just ask Herr Sesemann.

941
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:28,000
- He'll tell you the truth.
- Herr Sesemann?

942
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:30,880
What has Herr Sesemann
to do with this?

943
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,840
- Nothing. Nothing at all.
- He has too.

944
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:36,840
Aunt Dete brought me
there to play with Klara.

945
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:40,000
- I taught her her how to walk.
- Oh, this is ridiculous.

946
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:41,680
- Come along.
- Just a minute.

947
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:45,520
- Well, now, Lieutenant- - Perhaps
we'd better send for Herr Sesemann.

948
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:49,680
Oh, absurd! We- Well, we visited
the Sesemann house tonight.

949
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:51,920
Christmas, you know.
My sister's governess there.

950
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:55,440
It would be highly improper
to disturb Herr Sesemann at this hour!

951
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:57,480
I think you'd better
wait until we hear...

952
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:00,680
what Herr Sesemann
has got to say.

953
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:04,680
Grandfather!
Grandfather!

954
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,960
Dear, dear, dear.

955
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:20,120
Seems quite impossible.
Nothing emerges from the spigot.

956
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:22,640
- Not that way!
- Oh.

957
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:27,160
That way.

958
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:29,440
My word!

959
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:34,280
I say, Bearly's
a very warm goat, isn't she?

960
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:38,440
- Of course, silly. All goats are warm.
- How cozy.

961
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:41,640
Heidi,! Heidi,!
They're coming,!

962
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:43,960
Really ought to master this.

963
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:50,960
Let's have a race
to the grandfather.

964
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:58,360
Well, well.

965
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,440
Oh, Grandfather, this is Klara.

966
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:03,240
And just think-
she beat me running!

967
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:05,560
And I beat Herr Sesemann.

968
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:07,880
How do you do?

969
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:11,000
This is the grandmother
and Goat Peter.

970
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:14,560
And this is Pastor Schultz
and Frau Schultz.

971
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:16,720
I guess I can't deny it this time.

972
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:18,600
They were married yesterday.

973
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:20,800
Come, sit down, all of you!

974
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:24,040
You must be starved
after your climb up the mountain.

975
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:29,400
Bless us, O Lord,
in these Thy gifts...

976
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:31,040
which we are about to
receive from Thy bounty.

977
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:35,200
And please make every little boy and
girl in the world as happy as I am.

978
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:37,440
Amen.

979
01:27:38,305 --> 01:27:44,256
