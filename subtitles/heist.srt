2
00:01:25,034 --> 00:01:27,901
-Keep the change.
-What are you waiting on?

3
00:01:28,104 --> 00:01:33,201
-Four cappuccinos.
-Four cappuccinos. Let's go.

4
00:02:09,012 --> 00:02:11,742
-There you go.
-Thanks.

5
00:02:13,683 --> 00:02:17,676
-I've got a break.
-You can't smoke in here.

6
00:03:33,563 --> 00:03:36,225
Hey, buddy, you forgot your change.

7
00:03:39,903 --> 00:03:43,771
-Makes the world go round.
-What's that?

8
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,565
Gold.

9
00:03:46,442 --> 00:03:48,307
Some people say love.

10
00:03:48,511 --> 00:03:52,379
They're right too. It is Love.

11
00:03:52,715 --> 00:03:55,183
Love of gold.

12
00:05:35,318 --> 00:05:36,376
Hold on.

13
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:04,310
Thank God you're there.
There's been an explosion.

14
00:06:04,514 --> 00:06:07,813
Pick up the phone and dial 911.

15
00:06:35,878 --> 00:06:37,709
I'm burnt.

16
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:59,531
"18. 36. 7. Pound."

17
00:07:28,898 --> 00:07:30,593
What are you doing?

18
00:07:31,234 --> 00:07:33,862
Find the security tape!

19
00:09:19,842 --> 00:09:21,605
Enough.

20
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:15,854
Hey, thanks.

21
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,127
Hey, how'd it go?

22
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:21,599
Finest kind.

23
00:10:21,804 --> 00:10:24,830
-Where'd you get that?
-Here you go.

24
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,906
-You fixed it.
-I made a new one.

25
00:10:27,109 --> 00:10:30,442
-You're a pretty smart fella.
-Not that smart.

26
00:10:30,646 --> 00:10:35,208
-How'd you figure it out?
-I imagined someone smarter than me.

27
00:10:35,418 --> 00:10:38,717
Then I tried to think,
"What would he do?"

28
00:10:40,122 --> 00:10:44,582
-That's one hell of a boat.
-Sign up, I'll build you one.

29
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,054
-I wanna buy that one.
-Well, that's my boat.

30
00:10:48,264 --> 00:10:52,030
Come up with a down payment,
and I'll have it in 18 months.

31
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:56,671
-We're good at this conversation.
-Then close the deal.

32
00:10:56,872 --> 00:10:59,807
-There you go.
-What is it?

33
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:01,601
Open it up. It's yours.

34
00:11:02,178 --> 00:11:05,375
It's shaped like an arrow.
Freccia means arrow.

35
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,379
-So you told me.
-It looks Like gold.

36
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:11,849
-That's because I gilded it.
-Why?

37
00:11:12,822 --> 00:11:16,019
I wanted to sell you a boat.

38
00:11:16,225 --> 00:11:19,956
Good try, though.
I want that boat.

39
00:11:23,499 --> 00:11:28,129
Sell me that boat, and I'll come
down with a laundry bag of cash.

40
00:11:28,337 --> 00:11:32,933
Take the money, take your little girl,
cruise down to a tropic isle.

41
00:11:33,142 --> 00:11:35,736
-How will you get the cash?
-Don't be coy.

42
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:40,211
You know who I am. Sell me your boat,
you'll be under my wing.

43
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,680
That's my private number.

44
00:11:42,885 --> 00:11:48,687
I can't do it. I'm working on
your boat. Take mine out.

45
00:11:48,891 --> 00:11:51,086
Does that girl go with it?

46
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:57,122
Call me, I'll have five guys here
Monday laying out the hull.

47
00:11:57,533 --> 00:12:00,661
You decide to sell me your boat...

48
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,436
...let's do something, huh?

49
00:12:14,383 --> 00:12:18,877
-I'd have liked to build him that boat.
-Walk away from it.

50
00:12:22,124 --> 00:12:25,457
Well, Let’s start getting
the gear on board.

51
00:12:39,608 --> 00:12:42,338
-You got the charts?
-Oh, yeah.

52
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:46,909
Why so many?

53
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:51,853
Wouldn’t want somebody to look
at them and follow us.

54
00:12:52,388 --> 00:12:56,825
-How'd I get so lucky?
-You're the law west of the Pecos.

55
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:00,860
Yeah, I used to be
the Law west of the Pecos.

56
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,427
Now I'm cashing out.

57
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:08,098
-You got your picture took.
-Is that why I'm cashing out?

58
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:11,065
If you say it, it's right.

59
00:13:11,607 --> 00:13:14,132
You're the brass ring, babe.

60
00:13:15,845 --> 00:13:18,109
Glad you Like me.

61
00:13:23,786 --> 00:13:25,276
Off you go.

62
00:13:32,995 --> 00:13:34,326
See you tonight.

63
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,327
Stay in the shadows.

64
00:13:40,603 --> 00:13:42,969
Everyone's gonna be looking there.

65
00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:47,006
-Where's the place to be?
-Place to be is in the sun.

66
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,219
Beautiful.

67
00:13:58,888 --> 00:14:01,356
Just gorgeous.

68
00:14:03,626 --> 00:14:05,719
Nobody gets the goods Like you.

69
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:10,365
Anybody can get the goods.
The hard part's getting away.

70
00:14:10,566 --> 00:14:13,364
Plan a good getaway,
you can steal Ebbets Field.

71
00:14:13,569 --> 00:14:17,699
-Ebbets Field is gone.
-What'd I tell you?

72
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,210
My nephew, Jimmy Silk.

73
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:32,944
Yep, that's who he is.

74
00:14:33,155 --> 00:14:37,489
-He don't say hello?
-He must have things on his mind.

75
00:14:37,726 --> 00:14:40,286
Anything you want while you're here?

76
00:14:41,397 --> 00:14:43,831
Something for that pretty lady?

77
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:48,832
-What's she see in you anyway?
-I'm resilient.

78
00:14:49,038 --> 00:14:53,304
-So's Gumby.
-I got a better profile.

79
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:57,805
You're gonna leave that
down south in Argentina.

80
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,772
-How you doing, Bobby?
-I think you're Looking at it.

81
00:15:02,117 --> 00:15:04,847
You go down south, sit in the sun.

82
00:15:05,054 --> 00:15:09,491
Pull down your bathing suit,
stick your ass out at the world.

83
00:15:09,725 --> 00:15:12,523
You think the world’s ready for that?

84
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,659
The other thing.
We got the go-ahead.

85
00:15:17,866 --> 00:15:21,267
We got a firm date on the Swiss thing.

86
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,802
I'm burnt. They got my picture.

87
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,702
Of you in drag
with your war paint on.

88
00:15:26,909 --> 00:15:29,935
It's a blessing.
It's time to check out.

89
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:39,182
What do we got?

90
00:15:42,992 --> 00:15:46,223
-It's higher than the estimate.
-Half is yours.

91
00:15:46,428 --> 00:15:49,329
We're on for the Swiss thing.

92
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:52,227
Why did he tell me that half is mine?

93
00:15:52,434 --> 00:15:56,393
I know half of it's mine.
Me and my crew got it.

94
00:15:56,939 --> 00:15:59,931
I went in hock
and set it up on your say-so.

95
00:16:00,142 --> 00:16:03,600
Let's review. You let me
walk in there with my crew...

96
00:16:03,812 --> 00:16:05,905
...and now you're stiffing me?

97
00:16:06,115 --> 00:16:09,551
-If it was me--
-Yeah. I owe my crew.

98
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:12,414
I gotta get out of town,
I gotta go.

99
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:16,421
-Should have shot the girl.
-Should have been there.

100
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:20,618
This Swiss thing. If I was
a publisher, I'd publish the plans.

101
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:22,763
Why don't you?

102
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:28,096
If I was a publisher. But I'm a thief
so I have to do that thing.

103
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:32,236
Give me our cut.
We'll do the Swiss job.

104
00:16:32,441 --> 00:16:35,877
You know that's bullshit.
You're going travelling.

105
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:41,243
You gonna play me for a sucker?
I give you the money and you're gone.

106
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,918
The job's set up, you understand?

107
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:47,111
We did the job, my partners and me.

108
00:16:47,322 --> 00:16:50,485
Hey, fuck you and fuck your partners.

109
00:16:50,726 --> 00:16:55,663
I'm your partner. Without me
you've got, what? Little Lambsy Divy.

110
00:16:55,864 --> 00:17:01,461
-I bankroll this job on your say-so.
-I drove here, I didn't take the bus.

111
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:05,470
-Fuck you, go back to prison.
-What'd I tell you?

112
00:17:06,575 --> 00:17:08,338
I don't think so.

113
00:17:08,544 --> 00:17:11,513
-Guess again.
-You stay the fuck down.

114
00:17:16,518 --> 00:17:19,749
Want to play Elk Corral?
Wanna dress up and play?

115
00:17:20,923 --> 00:17:23,414
Is that the thing?
Is that it?

116
00:17:25,861 --> 00:17:29,319
Give me that fucking bag!

117
00:17:33,836 --> 00:17:36,100
Your weight and your fate right here.

118
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:40,207
Your weight and your fate right here.

119
00:17:40,709 --> 00:17:42,768
-Bag's empty, Bobby.
-What?

120
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,071
The bag is empty.

121
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:51,075
Put the bag down, it's empty.

122
00:17:53,756 --> 00:17:56,384
Want me to pull up a chair
while you rape me?

123
00:17:56,592 --> 00:17:59,891
If you'd pause in your
headstrong progress--

124
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:05,798
Joe, I'm in hock for all the toys.

125
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:10,995
All the toys you said go out
and buy. Two trucks, the plane.

126
00:18:11,206 --> 00:18:13,936
-You said spend the money.
-What do you want?

127
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,373
I want you to do the other thing.

128
00:18:16,578 --> 00:18:20,412
You screwed me.
Now my face is on a cereal box.

129
00:18:20,616 --> 00:18:23,983
You got no money!
You're burnt and busted.

130
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:28,714
What the fuck does it take
to get you to do the other thing?

131
00:18:32,261 --> 00:18:35,253
Excuse me, Mr. Bergman
asked you a question.

132
00:18:35,464 --> 00:18:39,195
Excuse me,
my uncle asked you a question.

133
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:42,996
-Fuck your uncle.
-Fuck my uncle? You're the help.

134
00:18:44,106 --> 00:18:49,043
Yeah, I'm the help, motherfucker.
Why'd the chicken cross the road?

135
00:18:49,244 --> 00:18:51,974
Because the road crossed the chicken.

136
00:18:52,181 --> 00:18:54,945
-Walk away.
-Hey, you! Hold on!

137
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,778
Situation is pristine.

138
00:18:57,986 --> 00:18:59,749
Cut him off.

139
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,195
I didn't see him.

140
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,434
Oh, my God!

141
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:17,699
How is he?

142
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,703
It's his road game.

143
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:43,625
-Your man does good work.
-That's why I use him.

144
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,494
Yeah, these will pass anywhere.

145
00:19:48,237 --> 00:19:50,899
Why don't you take advantage of it?

146
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,835
No.

147
00:19:54,376 --> 00:19:57,539
I need somebody to throw me
in the briar patch.

148
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:06,048
Yeah, give the gentleman a call.

149
00:20:17,699 --> 00:20:21,260
-I need some walking-around money.
-That's reasonable.

150
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,236
And I'm gonna need my men's share
on the last job.

151
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,431
-Give it to me.
-Now?

152
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,077
You got it in your pocket.

153
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:32,941
You're ahead of me every turn.

154
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,043
Stunning.

155
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:39,917
The plan holds,
you get your shipment on the 14th.

156
00:20:40,122 --> 00:20:44,149
The plan has changed.
We split it 50/50 on the site.

157
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:46,691
50/50.

158
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,020
So be it.

159
00:20:49,898 --> 00:20:54,392
-Now what's your surprise?
-My boy comes with you on the job.

160
00:20:56,939 --> 00:21:00,875
-He's got terrible manners.
-Which of us is perfect?

161
00:21:04,579 --> 00:21:06,547
So be it.

162
00:21:09,818 --> 00:21:15,256
Wait a sec. If it's about
your wife, why didn't you--?

163
00:21:15,457 --> 00:21:19,416
Will you wait? If the whole thing
is about your wife--?

164
00:21:19,628 --> 00:21:22,688
You know what?
The hell with it!

165
00:21:23,131 --> 00:21:25,531
Not a happy camper, huh?

166
00:21:26,268 --> 00:21:29,669
I'm not a camper at all, stud.
Pour it.

167
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,402
See anything you Like?

168
00:21:34,743 --> 00:21:36,472
I'm busy.

169
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,513
-Pour it!
-Hope you're not driving.

170
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:44,880
I hope I am, and I run into
some fucked abutment.

171
00:21:45,087 --> 00:21:49,421
-Take me off, will you?
-That'll rot your stomach lining.

172
00:21:49,624 --> 00:21:52,855
Yeah, but I get to drink it first.

173
00:21:59,601 --> 00:22:02,126
-That's all I need.
-What?

174
00:22:02,337 --> 00:22:04,862
There goes my job.
You see his badge?

175
00:22:05,474 --> 00:22:10,935
Do you know where that guy is from?
And he caught me drinking on shift.

176
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,988
End of a perfect day.

177
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:38,569
-That's Betty Croft.
-What's her problem?

178
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:42,175
-She's a drunk.
-She's a drunk.

179
00:22:42,377 --> 00:22:44,902
You bet she is.

180
00:22:46,815 --> 00:22:50,114
-Why is she important?
-She gets us in the door.

181
00:22:50,318 --> 00:22:52,548
She gets us in the door, how?

182
00:22:52,754 --> 00:22:57,054
I want you to Leave the uniforms
on the porch 3 or 4 days.

183
00:22:57,259 --> 00:22:59,750
Get the dry-cleaning smell
out of them.

184
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:02,623
When we do the switch, the highway--

185
00:23:06,001 --> 00:23:08,265
-Nobody can hear.
-If you don't say it.

186
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,631
I'm as quiet as
an ant pissing on cotton.

187
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:13,603
I don't want you as quiet as that ant.

188
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:18,837
I want you as quiet as an ant not
even thinking about pissing on cotton.

189
00:24:50,305 --> 00:24:53,604
Hello. I gotta report
a breakdown here.

190
00:24:53,808 --> 00:24:56,606
I got one of your rentals.
I need a tow truck.

191
00:24:56,811 --> 00:24:59,974
Oh, come on, don't tell me that.

192
00:25:00,615 --> 00:25:04,813
-Yeah, all right.
-What's the story on your pal?

193
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,511
He was born, he suffered, he died.

194
00:25:07,722 --> 00:25:11,852
-Can he do the thing?
-He was doing it before you were born.

195
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:16,992
See, that's what troubles me.

196
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:20,032
Maybe you want to pray about it?

197
00:25:20,235 --> 00:25:24,103
-No, I'm not a religious man.
-That's a shame.

198
00:25:25,006 --> 00:25:28,442
-How's the leg?
-Never better.

199
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:31,877
-How long has he been with that girl?
-Who?

200
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,846
-His wife.
-How long is a Chinaman's name?

201
00:25:36,851 --> 00:25:41,185
How long is a Chinaman's name?
You ever notice that?

202
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,359
Got the uniforms?

203
00:25:46,561 --> 00:25:49,758
Yeah, I got them.
I got them all aired out.

204
00:25:58,506 --> 00:26:00,531
-Rental trucks?
-Yeah.

205
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,637
What do we got?

206
00:26:02,844 --> 00:26:06,746
Gotta redo some of these figures.

207
00:26:06,948 --> 00:26:10,907
-I gotta start from scratch.
-Worked out on the plan. Why now?

208
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:14,953
When things start to go sour,
someone's gonna be pissing.

209
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:19,456
Looking to shoot somebody.
I want an alternate idea.

210
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,629
Why should it go sour?

211
00:26:23,365 --> 00:26:25,925
-You timing the wrecker?
-Yeah.

212
00:26:26,134 --> 00:26:30,833
Why should it go sour?
Was that such a stupid question?

213
00:26:31,072 --> 00:26:36,567
You ever cheat on a woman? Something,
stand her up, step out on her?

214
00:26:36,778 --> 00:26:38,109
What?

215
00:26:38,313 --> 00:26:41,111
-Ever do that?
-Yeah.

216
00:26:41,316 --> 00:26:44,183
-Did you have an excuse?
-Yeah.

217
00:26:44,386 --> 00:26:48,914
What if she didn't ask?
Was your alibi a waste of time?

218
00:26:56,431 --> 00:26:58,626
Is he gonna hold up?

219
00:26:59,301 --> 00:27:02,566
He's only gotta hold it together
till the thing.

220
00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:10,039
-Okay. All right.
-Is he backing up?

221
00:27:10,245 --> 00:27:11,678
Here he comes.

222
00:27:14,249 --> 00:27:16,308
Ain't that pretty.

223
00:27:20,021 --> 00:27:24,287
Don't start the car.
It's just a routine stop.

224
00:27:24,492 --> 00:27:27,154
Don't start the car.

225
00:27:30,198 --> 00:27:31,358
Good morning.

226
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:35,195
-Can I see some identification?
-Good of you to come.

227
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:38,770
You were supposed
to be here an hour ago.

228
00:27:38,973 --> 00:27:40,736
Just forget about this.

229
00:27:40,942 --> 00:27:45,140
It's no big deal. But we're
out here without protection.

230
00:27:45,347 --> 00:27:47,941
-Who'd you talk to?
-It burns my butt!

231
00:27:48,149 --> 00:27:52,950
-I understand.
-We're out working for the city!

232
00:27:53,154 --> 00:27:56,590
-Who did you talk to?
-I know it's not your fault.

233
00:27:56,791 --> 00:28:00,352
Who did you talk to?
Who did you talk to, sir?

234
00:28:04,232 --> 00:28:07,690
-Keep it together.
-Can he cool the guy out?

235
00:28:07,902 --> 00:28:11,736
-Pretend to write in your clipboard.
-Is he gonna be cool?

236
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,775
My motherfucker's so cool
when he goes to bed, sheep count him.

237
00:28:23,084 --> 00:28:26,542
Appreciate that.
Why are you mad at him?

238
00:28:26,755 --> 00:28:30,657
He's right. He's right.
Beg your pardon.

239
00:28:39,768 --> 00:28:41,895
-Get off.
-Get in the car.

240
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,503
-Get back in the car.
-You know....

241
00:28:45,073 --> 00:28:49,237
Give Pinky the piece.
Put your hands on the wheel.

242
00:28:49,444 --> 00:28:53,346
And keep them there.
Just keep it right there.

243
00:28:53,548 --> 00:28:56,813
We got it taken care of.
It's all right.

244
00:28:59,454 --> 00:29:01,684
-Thanks so much.
-All right.

245
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:04,688
Chuck! You got a phone call
right here.

246
00:29:04,893 --> 00:29:06,155
Excuse me.

247
00:29:06,361 --> 00:29:09,057
It's Mr. Smith at the office.

248
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,360
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Thank you, officer.

249
00:29:14,569 --> 00:29:19,597
Well, it's one of those days.
Got it.

250
00:29:28,483 --> 00:29:31,816
-You son of a bitch.
-Oh, that was real good.

251
00:29:32,987 --> 00:29:37,287
You fucking lame! Leave me dead
and the crew on the road.

252
00:29:37,492 --> 00:29:39,619
-I saw--
-You fucking cowboy!

253
00:29:39,828 --> 00:29:43,730
-Tell me why don't I kill him?
-How about we do?

254
00:29:43,932 --> 00:29:46,662
I'll put you down
Like the dog you are.

255
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:50,360
-You gonna shoot your way to stardom?
-I only--

256
00:29:50,572 --> 00:29:53,769
I don't want you
to do anything unless--

257
00:29:54,509 --> 00:29:57,103
We hit the city, you burn the car.

258
00:29:57,312 --> 00:29:59,337
-I'll take the--
-No, you do it!

259
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:04,875
Car's filthy. Whole fucking job's
in the car. You do it, Pinky!

260
00:30:10,325 --> 00:30:13,226
Get me the fuck out of here.

261
00:30:19,434 --> 00:30:22,426
Listen, it's very simple.
It's several elements.

262
00:30:22,637 --> 00:30:27,370
You got the tow truck.
You got the roadblock.

263
00:30:27,775 --> 00:30:32,212
I can do it, okay? I know the job.
I got the job cold.

264
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:35,007
You can't cut me loose.

265
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:38,951
Please, guys. We got a deal here!

266
00:30:39,153 --> 00:30:42,316
Why should we bet on you?
Young, dumb, full of cum.

267
00:30:42,524 --> 00:30:46,984
Leave me bleeding on the side
of the road. "He's just impetuous."

268
00:30:47,195 --> 00:30:52,064
Joe, security truck to the garage.
We beat the tow truck--

269
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:56,294
What's so fucking funny?
You got no job without me!

270
00:30:56,504 --> 00:30:58,768
You got nothing without this job.

271
00:30:58,973 --> 00:31:02,739
You want to go down south?
You want to go broke?

272
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:08,041
Without me, you got nothing.
You need the job. You need me!

273
00:31:08,249 --> 00:31:11,707
-You can't take him.
-Okay, I got loose, but--

274
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,718
You cannot take this lame
on the job, Joe!

275
00:31:15,924 --> 00:31:18,859
Can we just go calm here
for a minute?

276
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,995
Go calm?
So, what happened to you now?

277
00:31:22,196 --> 00:31:25,029
I'll tell you what happened to me.

278
00:31:25,233 --> 00:31:28,896
I need a fucking minute
to make a decision.

279
00:31:29,604 --> 00:31:33,506
-Fine.
-Joe, can I talk to you?

280
00:31:38,246 --> 00:31:42,148
-What the hell is it?
-They found the car.

281
00:31:44,218 --> 00:31:48,120
-What car?
-The station wagon. The cops found it.

282
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:52,782
How could they find it?
I told you to ditch the car.

283
00:31:53,595 --> 00:31:56,428
I stopped off to see my niece.

284
00:31:57,198 --> 00:32:00,292
-Did you wipe it down?
-You saw your niece?

285
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:03,470
Did you wipe it down?

286
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:08,472
-I left my clipboard in the car.
-What does this do to the job?

287
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:12,669
-You left your clipboard?
-My leg was troubling me.

288
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,509
-The job is on the clipboard.
-What about the job?

289
00:32:16,718 --> 00:32:20,415
-The job's on the clipboard!
-Job stands.

290
00:32:20,622 --> 00:32:22,886
-Are you crazy?
-The job stands?

291
00:32:23,091 --> 00:32:27,323
-The job is bust. This place is burnt.
-What does this mean?

292
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,758
Job stands.

293
00:32:29,964 --> 00:32:34,628
You're out of your fucking mind.
We can't sink with the job!

294
00:32:35,069 --> 00:32:39,438
Tell you what.
You want to run the show?

295
00:32:39,641 --> 00:32:41,905
It's fun to play pretend.
Come on!

296
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,670
You're gonna roll over
for these guys?

297
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:49,145
-I gotta go away.
-You took this lame on the job.

298
00:32:50,652 --> 00:32:52,313
Can't Leave with nothing.

299
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,081
You're drawing dead.
You want a fucking telegram?

300
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:59,920
The job is dead.

301
00:33:00,128 --> 00:33:04,064
You put your man in the street,
you lamed up the job.

302
00:33:04,265 --> 00:33:08,258
-Wait, wait, wait. Bobby!
-I can't sink with the job!

303
00:33:08,469 --> 00:33:11,996
Wait a second. Wait a second!

304
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:16,873
Baby, you got old.

305
00:33:20,148 --> 00:33:23,276
I'm gone, I'm out.
That's it.

306
00:33:23,484 --> 00:33:26,817
I don't see how
they could have found the car.

307
00:33:27,021 --> 00:33:29,319
Fuck the car, Pink!

308
00:33:29,524 --> 00:33:33,016
You're a stupid Lame.
I'm out of here.

309
00:33:33,695 --> 00:33:37,062
-I gotta get on with my life.
-Bobby, wait!

310
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:40,063
-Fran, what are you doing?
-Place is burnt.

311
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,065
Hold it, hold it.

312
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:47,135
For Christ sake!
You gotta move your car.

313
00:33:47,341 --> 00:33:50,071
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

314
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:53,076
What's going on?
What's the shot?

315
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:57,046
You got someplace to go? Some shade?

316
00:33:57,251 --> 00:34:01,119
You best get to it.
And move your car. I gotta go.

317
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:05,050
Shit, where's my piece?

318
00:34:05,259 --> 00:34:07,227
-I'll get it to you later.
-Now.

319
00:34:07,428 --> 00:34:10,454
What am I telling you?
Just follow me!

320
00:34:10,665 --> 00:34:15,432
Bobby, hold on! Just a minute!
For God's sake!

321
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:20,005
Walking away, Bobby?
You walking out on me?

322
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:23,507
Are you walking out on me,
you weak son of a bitch?

323
00:34:23,711 --> 00:34:25,576
Joe, I'm sorry.

324
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:28,772
Gonna get in your car?
After all this time!

325
00:34:29,016 --> 00:34:31,450
What the hell?

326
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:36,316
Come back here, you fucking coward!

327
00:34:36,524 --> 00:34:40,927
You're a fucking coward!
Go on, get the fuck out of here!

328
00:34:42,063 --> 00:34:43,655
Little prick.

329
00:34:50,204 --> 00:34:53,935
-And there they go!
-That's right.

330
00:34:54,142 --> 00:34:56,667
You get gone too.

331
00:35:01,783 --> 00:35:06,117
-I would’ve loved to do the Swiss job.
-It's a good plan.

332
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,379
Never Liked the Swiss.
Their clocks...

333
00:35:08,589 --> 00:35:12,081
...two guys come out with hammers
and hit each other.

334
00:35:12,293 --> 00:35:15,228
What kind of sick mentality is that?

335
00:35:15,429 --> 00:35:17,727
You take care, pally.

336
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,131
Get Bobby's share to him.

337
00:35:23,471 --> 00:35:27,100
-What'll you do for cash?
-We're taking down the boat guy.

338
00:35:27,308 --> 00:35:30,402
You're gonna take his cash?

339
00:35:30,611 --> 00:35:33,307
-I'm selling him my boat.
-And then?

340
00:35:34,115 --> 00:35:36,709
Then we'll take my boat back.

341
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:41,681
-Well, baby, then aloha.
-See you Later, Pinky.

342
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:46,724
It's a shame we didn't get to do
the Swiss job. It's a beautiful plan.

343
00:35:46,928 --> 00:35:49,658
-Cute.
-Cute as a pail of kittens.

344
00:35:50,431 --> 00:35:54,458
-Say goodbye to your niece for me.
-You bet, pal.

345
00:36:13,654 --> 00:36:17,215
You might want to put that out, sir.

346
00:36:20,027 --> 00:36:23,963
-Put it out. Put the cigar out.
-I told him.

347
00:36:24,165 --> 00:36:27,828
We got a fuel leak,
trying to put your cleat in.

348
00:36:28,035 --> 00:36:30,026
-Your arrow cleat.
-Her idea.

349
00:36:30,238 --> 00:36:35,073
-To put your stamp on it.
-Damned if I didn't cut the fuel line.

350
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,143
I wanted to take her out tonight.

351
00:36:38,346 --> 00:36:41,941
I know you did, sir,
and I'm sorry as hell.

352
00:36:42,149 --> 00:36:47,917
I'm gonna work all night and
I'll have it ready for sunup, okay?

353
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:53,085
All right, I want to re-ballast her.

354
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:55,819
Put her a bit by the stern.

355
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:07,541
I have the change of title, coast
guard certification and bill of sale.

356
00:37:07,742 --> 00:37:10,302
Let me show you something pretty.

357
00:37:12,413 --> 00:37:15,780
That's a lot of cash
to be carrying around.

358
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:20,420
-I brought a friend.
-Nice friend to have for a rainy day.

359
00:37:21,255 --> 00:37:22,916
Yes, sir.

360
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:27,993
-I'm sorry about that Leak.
-Forget about it.

361
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:32,257
We got forms, certifications....

362
00:37:32,466 --> 00:37:33,592
Fran.

363
00:37:34,235 --> 00:37:37,102
-Would you Like a cup of coffee?
-Yeah.

364
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:42,234
I want you to do something for me.
Look at this.

365
00:37:44,111 --> 00:37:47,012
I did this myself.
You're gonna Love it.

366
00:37:47,214 --> 00:37:50,012
This is what I want for a figurehead.

367
00:37:50,217 --> 00:37:52,583
Robin Hood.
What do you think?

368
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,715
I Like it because
it puts a twist on my name.

369
00:37:56,924 --> 00:38:00,985
Freccia is Italian for "arrow"
so you see the thing?

370
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:03,390
To personalize the boat.

371
00:38:03,597 --> 00:38:08,694
Robin Hood, robbing from the rich,
but who wants to rob from the poor?

372
00:38:08,903 --> 00:38:11,701
Let's see. Bill of sale.

373
00:38:11,906 --> 00:38:14,773
We got certificate of title.

374
00:38:16,277 --> 00:38:20,577
1400 hours on the engine.

375
00:38:20,781 --> 00:38:25,616
My people will contact you.
Here's what we're thinking--

376
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,344
Easy!

377
00:38:51,345 --> 00:38:55,042
Wait, wait, wait! Hold on!

378
00:40:36,484 --> 00:40:40,045
Are you alone? Are you alone?

379
00:40:40,254 --> 00:40:42,051
Are you alone?

380
00:40:45,726 --> 00:40:51,255
-What the fuck are you doing here?
-I Left my copy of the plans.

381
00:40:56,003 --> 00:40:58,301
Hey, hold on.

382
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,101
Call Freccia.

383
00:41:08,916 --> 00:41:10,281
Call Freccia.

384
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:19,522
You said the joint was burnt.
I don't understand.

385
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,456
-I didn't want--
-To what?

386
00:41:21,662 --> 00:41:24,028
I'm Looking out for you two.

387
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,926
He won't answer.

388
00:41:26,133 --> 00:41:30,365
What does she see in you?
You must be hung Like man-of-war.

389
00:41:38,112 --> 00:41:40,478
You want to play the dozens?

390
00:41:41,515 --> 00:41:42,846
Here we go.

391
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:46,679
There was an error at the hospital.
You died at birth.

392
00:41:46,887 --> 00:41:49,685
Cat got your tongue?
Don't you want to play?

393
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:52,381
Joe, Leave him.

394
00:42:04,471 --> 00:42:06,666
You going somewhere?

395
00:42:08,142 --> 00:42:11,407
What are you, the social service Lady?

396
00:42:18,752 --> 00:42:21,744
-Going somewhere?
-Taking the baby back?

397
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,754
You can't run.
You gotta do the job.

398
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:28,326
You know that you got to.
You know you do.

399
00:42:28,529 --> 00:42:33,193
Can you shoot me and walk away?
They'll hunt you down.

400
00:42:35,736 --> 00:42:39,832
-Shoot him.
-I can't go down there with nothing!

401
00:42:40,741 --> 00:42:42,675
Well...

402
00:42:42,876 --> 00:42:44,969
...that's the thing.

403
00:42:46,113 --> 00:42:47,705
-What'll you do?
-Out!

404
00:42:48,182 --> 00:42:52,619
And what? You owe them money.
Think you can just sail away?

405
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,789
-They'll never Let you walk away.
-Get out!

406
00:43:22,449 --> 00:43:24,576
What are we gonna do?

407
00:43:27,621 --> 00:43:29,987
That's what everybody wants to know.

408
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:42,692
How do we get the gold home?

409
00:43:42,903 --> 00:43:46,339
What's the difference?
They'll never trust you.

410
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,770
They need me to do the job.

411
00:43:48,976 --> 00:43:52,241
How can they trust you
not to walk over?

412
00:43:52,446 --> 00:43:54,311
-The kid came back?
-Yeah.

413
00:43:54,515 --> 00:43:59,077
-All right. Let's start again.
-Why'd the kid come back?

414
00:43:59,453 --> 00:44:00,442
Listen.

415
00:44:00,654 --> 00:44:03,487
He don't come back,
you're on some island.

416
00:44:03,691 --> 00:44:07,354
-I got an idea.
-You should’ve Left him on the road.

417
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:10,621
You shouldn’t have Left him
with the plans!

418
00:44:10,831 --> 00:44:12,731
What plans?

419
00:44:12,933 --> 00:44:16,994
He forgot his cheat sheet.
That's why he came back.

420
00:44:22,609 --> 00:44:26,136
He didn't forget it,
because I got it right here!

421
00:44:26,347 --> 00:44:31,148
What, am I gonna Leave my papers
in the hands of some fucking Lame?

422
00:44:31,352 --> 00:44:34,480
-That's why he came back.
-He came for me.

423
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,514
What?

424
00:44:37,624 --> 00:44:40,923
He came back to make sure I was okay.

425
00:44:41,962 --> 00:44:44,726
-He came back for you?
-That's right.

426
00:44:52,406 --> 00:44:54,874
I know how to get the gold.

427
00:44:55,676 --> 00:44:58,668
-Suit up.
-Sure you want to do that?

428
00:44:59,046 --> 00:45:03,574
-She's the go-getter.
-Tell me what you want me to go get.

429
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:06,810
I need you to suit up.
Is that all right?

430
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,454
You say it, it's right.

431
00:45:10,324 --> 00:45:11,985
All right.

432
00:45:12,659 --> 00:45:16,254
-We'll put the job off for a month.
-For a month?

433
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:22,696
I need dates for next month's shipment
and the name of a freight forwarder.

434
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:25,903
Freight forwarder
and a customs broker.

435
00:45:28,008 --> 00:45:31,603
-Good.
-Where are you going with this?

436
00:45:33,747 --> 00:45:35,908
You just listen.

437
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:39,681
We're gonna stand this thing
on its head.

438
00:45:42,556 --> 00:45:47,516
Are you fucking with me?
Or are you done fucking with me?

439
00:45:47,728 --> 00:45:53,132
I've financialized the problem, and
you're more trouble than you're worth.

440
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,063
The girl says you'll do it.
You said that before.

441
00:45:57,271 --> 00:46:00,638
Why now?
What is it, all of a sudden?

442
00:46:02,042 --> 00:46:06,945
Everybody needs money.
That's why they call it "money."

443
00:46:07,147 --> 00:46:09,138
Let me add this sweetener.

444
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:12,580
Do the fucking job,
or I'll turn you over.

445
00:46:12,786 --> 00:46:17,519
I'll drop a Roosevelt dime on you.
Finite la Commedia.

446
00:46:17,724 --> 00:46:20,284
Is that strict, you fucking vonce?

447
00:46:20,494 --> 00:46:23,952
Sorry to use such language
in front of a woman...

448
00:46:24,164 --> 00:46:28,225
...were it not for who,
I'd waste your fucking ass.

449
00:46:28,435 --> 00:46:32,565
If you say you'll do the job, do it.
No more charades.

450
00:46:32,773 --> 00:46:36,436
Save the bold moves
for the brilliant players.

451
00:46:38,312 --> 00:46:40,837
-Sorry for the Language.
-How generous.

452
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:45,348
And fuck you too! Save the bullshit.
He wants the job.

453
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:47,782
Is that a question?

454
00:46:48,956 --> 00:46:53,950
You came begging to me, doxy.
I didn't come to you.

455
00:46:54,161 --> 00:46:58,393
He'll do the job next month.
He needs a month.

456
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:03,536
-Is that the thing?
-Is that what I just told you?

457
00:47:05,105 --> 00:47:10,805
-Ain't you a piece of work.
-I came from China in a matchbox.

458
00:47:11,812 --> 00:47:13,439
Thank you.

459
00:47:17,885 --> 00:47:21,116
Fill up her drink,
she seems to enjoy it.

460
00:47:21,321 --> 00:47:22,686
What do you think?

461
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:25,256
-He's scared.
-He's never scared.

462
00:47:25,459 --> 00:47:27,984
-He's getting old.
-She said that?

463
00:47:28,195 --> 00:47:33,292
He's broke, he's tired.
She says he wants to play ball.

464
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:36,799
Why should we believe her?
Why did he send her?

465
00:47:37,004 --> 00:47:40,531
-She came to me.
-To you?

466
00:47:41,408 --> 00:47:44,809
-He put her up to it.
-She came to me on her own.

467
00:47:45,012 --> 00:47:49,039
Yeah, but as rational men,
don't we have to doubt her?

468
00:47:49,249 --> 00:47:52,946
She thinks he's weak.
She's scared, she's sincere.

469
00:47:53,153 --> 00:47:55,713
Let me put a question to you:

470
00:47:55,923 --> 00:47:59,791
If you had the job,
how would you test her sincerity?

471
00:48:12,573 --> 00:48:17,943
Okay, we're all on one team,
all arrayed against a common enemy?

472
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:21,137
Thanks for coming.
I'm going to bed.

473
00:48:22,516 --> 00:48:25,007
-I'll see you back.
-I'm all right.

474
00:48:25,218 --> 00:48:28,415
-You're all right now.
-Am I?

475
00:48:28,622 --> 00:48:31,489
You just need somebody to lean on.

476
00:48:46,389 --> 00:48:49,654
-Adrenaline gives you the shakes.
-I'm okay.

477
00:48:49,859 --> 00:48:53,522
I'm just saying,
adrenaline gives people the shakes.

478
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:57,097
Some mistake it for cowardice.
You could pray.

479
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,961
I'm not a religious man.

480
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:02,605
-There's nothing wrong with prayer.
-Think so?

481
00:49:02,806 --> 00:49:08,574
I knew this trooper who always
carried a Bible next to his heart.

482
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,937
-It stopped a bullet.
-No shit?

483
00:49:12,148 --> 00:49:16,915
Hand to God, it stopped a bullet.
Would’ve ruined his heart.

484
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:22,558
Had he had another Bible in front
of his face, he'd be alive today.

485
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:27,121
-What time you got?
-5:18.

486
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:30,560
Make the call.

487
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:46,346
Hello? I got one of your rental
trucks. The engine quit on me.

488
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:02,314
-Nobody lives forever.
-Frank Sinatra gave it a shot.

489
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:06,695
You'll do.

490
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,887
Good morning.

491
00:51:47,871 --> 00:51:49,395
It's the acid.

492
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:53,064
It isn't the acid, it's the asphalt.
It's making me sick.

493
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:56,507
How can they work in that
all day long?

494
00:51:56,713 --> 00:51:59,443
-Got any Rolaids?
-Want an Alka Seltzer?

495
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:03,085
-Doctor said not to drink.
-You shouldn’t then.

496
00:52:06,689 --> 00:52:11,149
Same old story everywhere you go.

497
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:13,420
You know....

498
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:17,157
Oh, no.

499
00:52:18,067 --> 00:52:22,197
-Do I know you?
-No. Please, please.

500
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:25,670
-What?
-Don't fire me. Please.

501
00:52:25,875 --> 00:52:28,844
-What do you mean?
-Don't fire me.

502
00:52:29,045 --> 00:52:32,481
I saw you in the bar.
You're with the FAA.

503
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:47,995
Miss Croft, you're drinking
on the job. You're done.

504
00:52:48,197 --> 00:52:53,134
I got two kids at home.
Please, mister.

505
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:55,133
Give me your keys.

506
00:52:55,638 --> 00:52:59,631
Mister, I need a break.
I'm begging you.

507
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:05,838
I swear to you on my Life that
I will never take another drink.

508
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:08,279
Don't fire me.

509
00:53:08,484 --> 00:53:12,045
Did you ever ask anybody for a break?

510
00:53:12,255 --> 00:53:15,247
Do you have any kids?

511
00:53:15,792 --> 00:53:18,488
Oh, Christ.

512
00:53:18,728 --> 00:53:23,631
In about three minutes,
I'll be conducting a security check.

513
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:28,270
I'll be passing through your station.
I will be, quote, armed.

514
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:30,632
I will have a tool kit...

515
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:34,776
...in which is hidden
three dangerous items.

516
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:38,379
It's a test of
the personnel under you.

517
00:53:38,581 --> 00:53:41,914
If you tip them off,
I'll have your job.

518
00:53:42,418 --> 00:53:44,181
I wouldn’t.

519
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,480
Go back to your station.

520
00:53:46,689 --> 00:53:49,453
-I will.
-Give me your keys.

521
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:52,588
Your alcohol.

522
00:53:53,529 --> 00:53:56,327
-You will go into the program.
-I will.

523
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,459
Thank you!

524
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:16,113
That's it.

525
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:28,692
-Is Betty Croft here?
-Is what?

526
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:31,799
-Your supervisor.
-She went for coffee.

527
00:54:33,102 --> 00:54:35,866
It's that time of day, isn't it?

528
00:54:40,943 --> 00:54:43,434
Can I Leave my tools
for a minute?

529
00:54:43,646 --> 00:54:45,477
That's no problem.

530
00:54:54,691 --> 00:54:58,991
-What happened to Betty Croft?
-I think she's sick.

531
00:54:59,195 --> 00:55:04,428
I don't feel so good myself.
Give me one of these, will you?

532
00:55:04,667 --> 00:55:08,364
And a large coffee.
Leave some room for milk.

533
00:55:15,511 --> 00:55:17,342
Here you go.

534
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,647
Hold, hold, hold.

535
00:55:29,726 --> 00:55:33,526
-Here's your change.
-Thank you.

536
00:55:51,547 --> 00:55:52,946
What's happening?

537
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:56,744
What's happening is stay put.
Put her in park.

538
00:55:56,953 --> 00:55:59,751
Don't flash your brake lights.

539
00:56:08,831 --> 00:56:11,800
-There we go.
-Going to see the elephant.

540
00:56:40,229 --> 00:56:44,928
-Up early or up late?
-Not at all, until I get this in me.

541
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:51,172
What's with that--?
What's with your supervisor?

542
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:55,640
-What, does she owe you money?
-I wish she did.

543
00:56:55,845 --> 00:57:00,612
She's got some stomach thing.
Least Little thing sets her off.

544
00:57:02,084 --> 00:57:06,987
I had an aunt Like that once.
She wasn't really my aunt.

545
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:09,556
We just called her that.

546
00:57:09,992 --> 00:57:14,088
She had a florist shop.
Funny thing was, she was allergic.

547
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:17,598
We used to tease her about that.

548
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:21,736
You know how cruel kids can be.

549
00:57:22,638 --> 00:57:25,869
-On the floor.
-With that Little thing?

550
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:29,306
-Don't. Sit on the floor.
-Doing it.

551
00:57:41,924 --> 00:57:44,893
Give me the case!
Open it up!

552
00:57:49,932 --> 00:57:51,695
You okay?

553
00:57:53,502 --> 00:57:55,333
What happened?

554
00:57:55,538 --> 00:57:58,029
Clean up this mess.

555
00:58:25,735 --> 00:58:29,193
-What happened?
-The broad went bust on me.

556
00:58:29,405 --> 00:58:32,841
-What do you mean, she went bust?
-Just drive.

557
00:58:40,549 --> 00:58:45,543
Hinton Tower. Confirm
A.T.C. clearance to Philadelphia.

558
00:58:45,755 --> 00:58:49,953
Proceed. Hold for release.
Contact Control upon departing.

559
00:58:59,402 --> 00:59:03,236
There you go. Hotel Bravo 704.

560
00:59:18,587 --> 00:59:19,576
Come on.

561
01:00:13,342 --> 01:00:15,310
What the hell?

562
01:00:17,179 --> 01:00:20,114
Hinton Tower, what the hell was that?

563
01:00:20,316 --> 01:00:25,049
-Anyone on final?
-We have TransAir 249, base.

564
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:29,281
-Divert!
-TransAir 249, go around.

565
01:00:38,834 --> 01:00:44,329
PanGeneve, proceed to runway Alpha
India. Contact Providence Control.

566
01:00:44,573 --> 01:00:48,441
This is PanGeneve 242,
we are now taking the active.

567
01:00:48,644 --> 01:00:51,010
-He's not stopping.
-Cut him off.

568
01:00:51,213 --> 01:00:54,046
-It's not that easy.
-Cut him the fuck off!

569
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:57,511
PanGeneve?

570
01:01:57,713 --> 01:01:59,704
Can you hear me?

571
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:07,083
We have reports of
a possible explosive device on board.

572
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:10,390
We want you to cut your engines.

573
01:02:11,393 --> 01:02:15,193
We got a man who's coming on board
to advise you.

574
01:02:15,431 --> 01:02:21,392
Cut your engines, kill all your power,
your electronics and the radio.

575
01:02:21,604 --> 01:02:24,004
Stay off the radio.

576
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:30,042
-What is it?
-Shut off the engine.

577
01:02:30,212 --> 01:02:32,646
Kill your radar, keep your A.P.U. on.

578
01:02:32,848 --> 01:02:35,749
There may be an explosive device
on board.

579
01:02:36,018 --> 01:02:38,179
Stay seated while I make a sweep.

580
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:41,288
Be in touch with my man on the ground.

581
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:48,196
-How serious is this threat?
-Just be in touch with my man.

582
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:51,795
Don't talk to the tower, talk to me.

583
01:02:52,001 --> 01:02:54,367
Yeah.

584
01:02:54,904 --> 01:02:58,169
Cut the radio and electronics.
Can you hear me?

585
01:02:58,374 --> 01:03:02,071
Don't talk to the tower.
I'm linked to the tower.

586
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:05,326
Beech 270 remains
18 miles from the outer marker.

587
01:05:05,534 --> 01:05:09,265
Adjust to 612 your GCA. Good day.

588
01:06:10,065 --> 01:06:15,833
Hold on. Hold it. I show PanGeneve
outbound to 1205 Zulu.

589
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:19,030
Providence Control wants to know
where is he?

590
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:22,108
PanGeneve 262, who's got him?

591
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:25,906
I got him right there,
visual on the runway.

592
01:06:26,115 --> 01:06:28,640
PanGeneve, he's right there.

593
01:06:28,851 --> 01:06:34,687
Break, Manchester Control.
I have an inbound Lear, 5-2 Papa.

594
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:38,690
Can you take him? Squawk, 1795 direct.

595
01:06:38,894 --> 01:06:43,456
Manchester, I got him.
Clear 5-2 Papa.

596
01:07:44,193 --> 01:07:45,820
Bobby?

597
01:07:46,028 --> 01:07:47,859
Keep your eyes on the road.

598
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:50,260
You got change for a 20?

599
01:07:53,335 --> 01:07:55,132
All right.

600
01:07:57,673 --> 01:08:00,107
How you Like me now, babe?

601
01:08:01,844 --> 01:08:03,675
All right.

602
01:08:12,988 --> 01:08:14,353
Do not transfer me!

603
01:08:14,556 --> 01:08:18,617
Do not transfer me! You're
the fourth person I've talked to!

604
01:08:18,827 --> 01:08:20,192
-Enough!
-Come on!

605
01:08:20,395 --> 01:08:25,298
Engine failure! I called first
at 5:20 this morning.

606
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:27,560
This is my fourth call!

607
01:08:27,769 --> 01:08:29,828
Keep coming. Whoa!

608
01:08:30,038 --> 01:08:31,528
Good.

609
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:36,775
-How Long before the tow truck?
-I called at 5:20 in the morning.

610
01:08:36,979 --> 01:08:40,073
-Let's go!
-Yes. Outside the airport.

611
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:43,080
Industrial and 207.

612
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:47,517
I'm an attorney! Can I have your name?
I'm gonna have your job!

613
01:08:49,424 --> 01:08:51,449
-The truck's almost here.
-Good.

614
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:53,594
You score?

615
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:57,031
-Look at that.
-Oh, my, oh, my.

616
01:08:57,232 --> 01:09:00,827
Go sell chocolate,
you Heidi motherfuckers.

617
01:09:01,036 --> 01:09:02,560
We got your gold!

618
01:09:02,771 --> 01:09:04,864
Hey, Let me have that. Yeah!

619
01:09:05,073 --> 01:09:09,635
Two minutes before the setup's over!
Tow truck will be here. Let's go!

620
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:14,680
-When that cop comes to....
-That's gotta be what it's gonna be.

621
01:09:14,883 --> 01:09:19,320
-Can you get through a roadblock?
-Whatever. It's all of a piece.

622
01:09:21,523 --> 01:09:23,787
You're burnt.

623
01:09:23,992 --> 01:09:26,051
You're burnt!

624
01:09:26,261 --> 01:09:27,956
We're all going together.

625
01:09:28,163 --> 01:09:31,394
I do not see the percentage.

626
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:35,036
You don't have to, baby.

627
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:38,798
You're burnt. You're fucking burnt,
old man!

628
01:09:39,007 --> 01:09:41,373
-I go with the gold.
-With the gold?

629
01:09:41,543 --> 01:09:43,670
What are you telling your beads?

630
01:09:43,879 --> 01:09:45,608
Look, man, you tell me.

631
01:09:45,814 --> 01:09:49,045
What are they going
to Look harder at? Tell me!

632
01:09:49,251 --> 01:09:53,381
You, here with us,
or you in an empty car?

633
01:09:55,057 --> 01:09:59,153
You tell me. You follow us
through the roadblock.

634
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:00,851
Joe, you're burned.

635
01:10:01,063 --> 01:10:06,000
When that cop comes through,
they'll put him at the roadblock.

636
01:10:06,201 --> 01:10:08,533
It's the wise thing.

637
01:10:09,738 --> 01:10:13,230
You go in the van with the gold.
It'll be all right.

638
01:10:13,442 --> 01:10:15,273
-I'll meet you.
-Okay.

639
01:10:15,477 --> 01:10:18,139
-Let's go, guys. Come on!
-Let's move!

640
01:10:18,347 --> 01:10:20,372
Wrap it up! Let's go!

641
01:10:20,582 --> 01:10:23,050
Bobby. There you go, pal.

642
01:10:24,953 --> 01:10:27,183
Come on, Let’s go!

643
01:10:27,956 --> 01:10:31,392
You heard what the man said.
Let's go! Move!

644
01:10:32,794 --> 01:10:36,821
-You gotta move. Get in the car. Go!
-Okay.

645
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:41,835
Joe! I'll see you at the meet.

646
01:10:42,037 --> 01:10:43,834
See you at the meet!

647
01:10:50,145 --> 01:10:52,636
-Joe!
-What?

648
01:10:52,848 --> 01:10:55,817
Come on, keep it together, boy!

649
01:10:56,018 --> 01:10:58,043
It's not over yet!

650
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:00,950
Let's go. Fran!

651
01:11:01,156 --> 01:11:03,784
-Keys.
-See you at the meet.

652
01:11:03,992 --> 01:11:05,755
Hey, Joe, Listen.

653
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:09,692
-It's the smart thing. It is.
-Yeah, all right.

654
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:11,024
-My God!
-What?

655
01:11:11,233 --> 01:11:13,724
She missed the fucking tow truck.

656
01:11:58,513 --> 01:12:00,481
He'll meet us there.

657
01:12:10,792 --> 01:12:12,987
-Don't smoke.
-Makes me Look calm.

658
01:12:13,195 --> 01:12:16,062
What kind of people try to Look calm?

659
01:12:17,165 --> 01:12:23,126
Get away from the van! Put your hands
on your head and walk towards me.

660
01:12:23,338 --> 01:12:26,603
You, the man. Kneel on the grass!
Come on!

661
01:12:26,808 --> 01:12:28,833
-Lady, stop there!
-Kneel!

662
01:12:29,010 --> 01:12:31,535
-Open the van. Open it!
-It's unlocked.

663
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:34,682
Don't Look at me, Look at the grass!

664
01:12:39,588 --> 01:12:41,180
-What's that?
-An engine.

665
01:12:41,389 --> 01:12:44,654
-For what?
-A fucking tractor. I don't know.

666
01:12:48,296 --> 01:12:50,059
Okay.

667
01:12:50,232 --> 01:12:53,065
-How Long have you been here?
-What's wrong?

668
01:12:53,268 --> 01:12:54,462
How Long?

669
01:12:54,669 --> 01:12:58,469
Since 4:00 a.m.,
waiting for the fucking tow truck.

670
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:03,269
-What's the problem?
-There was a robbery.

671
01:14:23,491 --> 01:14:25,686
Come on, Let’s go!

672
01:14:26,294 --> 01:14:29,957
Move the truck through! Come on!

673
01:14:54,055 --> 01:14:56,489
You were good with the cops.

674
01:14:56,691 --> 01:14:59,819
Oh, yeah,
I'm the Long lost motherfucker.

675
01:15:00,028 --> 01:15:02,929
You think good on your feet.

676
01:15:03,131 --> 01:15:07,898
-You think good off your feet too.
-Well, aren't you sweet.

677
01:15:08,303 --> 01:15:13,297
-What do you say we stop for a drink?
-Let's get to the meet.

678
01:15:13,508 --> 01:15:17,706
Yeah, that's difficult.
Want me to tell you why?

679
01:15:17,913 --> 01:15:20,177
There is no meet.

680
01:15:25,186 --> 01:15:27,814
-Joe wouldn’t Like that.
-We Left Joe.

681
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:30,355
There is no meet, you know that.

682
01:15:30,558 --> 01:15:33,823
Your guy got his picture
on a stamp. He got old.

683
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:38,466
Let's cut the jiving.
What kind of man sends his wife to me?

684
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:44,196
To distract me? Surprise! I was taken
in. How about that? What a fool I am.

685
01:15:44,406 --> 01:15:46,101
Would I do that to you?

686
01:15:46,308 --> 01:15:48,538
Would I do that to you?

687
01:15:48,743 --> 01:15:50,074
And who Liked it?

688
01:15:50,278 --> 01:15:55,739
For old-time's sake, why don't we
cut the nonsense and say what it is?

689
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,347
I need a drink.

690
01:16:00,555 --> 01:16:03,615
Did he think he was going home
with the gold?

691
01:16:03,792 --> 01:16:08,456
Only one who didn't know was him.
He needed someone to draw it for him.

692
01:16:08,663 --> 01:16:12,724
And you went with it, all the way.
Was you joking?

693
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:17,563
Answer me, because I'll tell you
what we could do with that gold.

694
01:16:39,327 --> 01:16:41,318
Where are you going?

695
01:16:42,330 --> 01:16:44,924
-Are you okay?
-Where are you going?

696
01:16:45,133 --> 01:16:47,431
I'm gonna check on the gold.

697
01:16:47,635 --> 01:16:49,466
Leave it!

698
01:16:49,904 --> 01:16:51,599
Walk away from it!

699
01:16:51,806 --> 01:16:54,297
-Leave it!
-Walk away?

700
01:16:54,776 --> 01:16:56,971
What are you, crazy?

701
01:16:57,178 --> 01:17:00,705
The truck's clean, for Christ sake.

702
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:04,885
Think I'm gonna walk away
from this--?

703
01:18:46,221 --> 01:18:48,189
How you doing?

704
01:18:48,389 --> 01:18:50,949
Hey, you know.

705
01:18:51,159 --> 01:18:53,423
Yeah, here you go.

706
01:18:53,761 --> 01:18:55,490
What is it?

707
01:18:56,297 --> 01:18:58,629
What the hell do you care?

708
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:02,366
Well, that's true too.

709
01:19:12,413 --> 01:19:15,382
-Hell of a thing!
-It's a hell of a thing!

710
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:19,714
My shipment was supposed to be
in Philly by 9 yesterday.

711
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:22,321
-Right.
-Called me back from vacation!

712
01:19:22,524 --> 01:19:27,291
They said, "Your load is still
on the ground. It never Left Boston."

713
01:19:27,695 --> 01:19:30,858
-We had a robbery.
-No kidding!

714
01:19:31,065 --> 01:19:35,661
-You had a robbery? Anybody hurt?
-Couple pilots shaken up a Little.

715
01:19:35,870 --> 01:19:39,362
You had a robbery,
and you impound the plane?

716
01:19:40,575 --> 01:19:45,308
-What did they take?
-Some Load from Switzerland.

717
01:19:55,757 --> 01:19:58,783
-Didn't they offer the next flight?
-What?

718
01:19:58,993 --> 01:20:01,962
Didn't they offer
their next flight to Philly?

719
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:03,757
Oh, yeah.

720
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:07,492
Their next flight is 8 a.m. tomorrow.

721
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:11,935
It has to be in Philly yesterday.
I gotta drive it there myself.

722
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:16,668
If I don't have that Load in Philly
by dawn, there's my job!

723
01:20:18,546 --> 01:20:20,537
Here it is.

724
01:20:23,651 --> 01:20:25,744
Hell of a thing.

725
01:20:26,754 --> 01:20:28,688
Hell of a thing.

726
01:20:58,686 --> 01:21:01,849
-Come to dinner tonight.
-We'll have to see.

727
01:21:02,657 --> 01:21:05,455
You always say that.
It means you won't.

728
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:07,560
Well, it's possible.

729
01:21:07,762 --> 01:21:10,663
It's possible that my business....

730
01:21:10,865 --> 01:21:15,063
-I might have to travel.
-Why can't you do business here?

731
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:18,637
I wish I could, baby. The fact is...

732
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,967
...I have to Leave this morning.

733
01:21:21,175 --> 01:21:25,043
-This morning?
-That's when my plane leaves.

734
01:21:28,449 --> 01:21:29,780
Times change.

735
01:21:29,984 --> 01:21:33,511
In my day, kids had to walk
all the way to school.

736
01:21:33,721 --> 01:21:38,283
-Yes, but the streets were safer.
-Is that so?

737
01:21:39,627 --> 01:21:43,961
-You take care of yourself, kid.
-Bye, Uncle Donny.

738
01:21:51,306 --> 01:21:53,831
-Nice day for the race.
-What race?

739
01:21:54,042 --> 01:21:58,342
The human race. Kids growing up,
so on. Hope of the future.

740
01:21:58,546 --> 01:22:00,946
Get in the fucking car.

741
01:24:34,602 --> 01:24:38,003
-Where's the gold?
-I'm reluctant to tell you.

742
01:24:38,206 --> 01:24:43,439
When we put it to you, you'll tell us
the gross national product of Bolivia!

743
01:24:43,644 --> 01:24:46,238
You'll tell us
the area code of Belgium!

744
01:24:46,447 --> 01:24:47,675
It's all I know.

745
01:24:47,882 --> 01:24:50,248
This is all you know.

746
01:24:50,451 --> 01:24:55,252
This is all you know! And we got you
going to Saint Croix!

747
01:24:55,456 --> 01:24:59,950
How do you pick up your share?
Where's the gold? Where's the meet?

748
01:25:00,161 --> 01:25:02,721
What are you gonna do, hurt me?

749
01:25:02,930 --> 01:25:05,922
Well, no. Actually, no.

750
01:25:06,601 --> 01:25:08,330
I'm not gonna hurt you.

751
01:25:08,503 --> 01:25:11,438
But tell a guy.
I'm full of admiration.

752
01:25:11,639 --> 01:25:14,699
What was the deal?

753
01:25:14,909 --> 01:25:18,902
The deal was, we get away
with the gold. Cute, huh?

754
01:25:19,113 --> 01:25:21,104
That's charming. Then what?

755
01:25:21,983 --> 01:25:24,816
-We slip away.
-You slip away?

756
01:25:25,019 --> 01:25:29,080
And we go to the meet, and we
find pig iron? Is that it?

757
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:32,987
Joe figured you weren't
never going to the meet.

758
01:25:33,194 --> 01:25:35,025
He did?

759
01:25:35,463 --> 01:25:38,830
If your guy doesn't get it
in his head to fly off...

760
01:25:39,033 --> 01:25:43,060
...we're all on the patio right now,
having a margarita!

761
01:25:43,471 --> 01:25:45,871
Where's the gold?

762
01:25:46,073 --> 01:25:49,065
You understand my reluctance
to tell you.

763
01:25:50,845 --> 01:25:53,370
Take him out and show him something.

764
01:25:55,816 --> 01:25:57,841
Don't hurt him.

765
01:26:02,823 --> 01:26:05,553
You got anything to say about this?

766
01:26:19,173 --> 01:26:22,233
Fran? Has she called in?

767
01:26:22,443 --> 01:26:25,412
She won't call
until she ditches the guy.

768
01:26:25,613 --> 01:26:28,013
How is she gonna ditch him?

769
01:26:28,516 --> 01:26:31,485
She could talk her way
out of a sunburn.

770
01:26:34,188 --> 01:26:35,314
That's right.

771
01:26:47,668 --> 01:26:48,657
Yeah?

772
01:26:48,869 --> 01:26:50,359
Joe.

773
01:26:50,571 --> 01:26:53,165
Yeah, how you doing?

774
01:26:54,108 --> 01:26:56,076
Just checking in.

775
01:26:56,877 --> 01:26:59,971
Fine, finest. Pristine.

776
01:27:01,215 --> 01:27:02,876
Yeah, I know.

777
01:27:03,451 --> 01:27:06,215
I saw the truck drive through too.

778
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:08,081
Isn't it?

779
01:27:08,289 --> 01:27:11,315
-See you at the meet.
-Okay.

780
01:27:24,405 --> 01:27:26,839
Mr. Bergman, please.

781
01:27:28,042 --> 01:27:29,907
Hold on.

782
01:27:33,981 --> 01:27:36,176
So where's the gold?

783
01:27:39,687 --> 01:27:42,281
You're shitting me.

784
01:27:54,635 --> 01:27:56,159
Is that all right?

785
01:27:56,370 --> 01:27:58,167
Okay.

786
01:28:01,308 --> 01:28:03,139
Okay.

787
01:29:14,515 --> 01:29:16,244
How you doing?

788
01:29:16,450 --> 01:29:18,714
We're all packed up.

789
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,351
How'd you ditch that guy?

790
01:29:22,857 --> 01:29:25,826
-Leave him at the altar?
-Yeah, at the altar.

791
01:29:26,026 --> 01:29:27,960
That's my girl.

792
01:29:30,164 --> 01:29:32,223
What happened to you?

793
01:29:32,433 --> 01:29:34,230
Yeah, yeah.

794
01:29:34,435 --> 01:29:38,735
There was a change in plans,
you couldn’t call to tell me?

795
01:29:39,874 --> 01:29:42,638
-Get him off the boat.
-Off the boat!

796
01:29:43,410 --> 01:29:45,503
Get off the boat!

797
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:49,076
Yeah, that's right.

798
01:29:50,184 --> 01:29:52,379
Where's your friend?

799
01:29:53,687 --> 01:29:55,518
Where's your friend?

800
01:29:55,723 --> 01:29:57,088
You all alone?

801
01:29:57,291 --> 01:30:01,318
No. You ain't alone.
It ain't good to be alone.

802
01:30:01,529 --> 01:30:02,518
Dump it.

803
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:04,163
Go find his friend.

804
01:30:04,365 --> 01:30:07,732
-I didn't have a choice.
-Let my wife go!

805
01:30:07,935 --> 01:30:11,427
Mind if I say something personal?
Your wife's a whore.

806
01:30:11,639 --> 01:30:14,506
You two fucked this plan
into a cocked hat.

807
01:30:14,708 --> 01:30:18,109
-After all we went through together!
-Fuck you!

808
01:30:18,312 --> 01:30:20,872
-I was gonna make you rich.
-Is that so?

809
01:30:21,081 --> 01:30:24,448
I was gonna make you rich,
you motherfucker.

810
01:30:24,652 --> 01:30:27,348
But you had to complicate
the last bit.

811
01:30:27,555 --> 01:30:28,749
You piece of shit!

812
01:30:28,956 --> 01:30:31,254
Yeah? Who's kneeling on the dock?

813
01:30:31,625 --> 01:30:33,957
-He ain't there.
-All right.

814
01:30:34,862 --> 01:30:37,092
Okay. You want to wrap it up?

815
01:30:37,631 --> 01:30:40,498
Want to stand around
and guess my real name?

816
01:30:40,701 --> 01:30:43,261
-What is your name?
-Rumpelstiltskin!

817
01:30:43,504 --> 01:30:46,439
-What was it before?
-Watch your mouth!

818
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:49,473
-Leave him the fuck alone!
-Get back!

819
01:30:49,677 --> 01:30:51,577
Get her out of here!

820
01:30:53,047 --> 01:30:57,416
You had to go out on a limb,
didn't you?

821
01:30:57,618 --> 01:31:01,486
-Didn't you?
-Let her go. I'll give up the gold.

822
01:31:01,856 --> 01:31:05,189
Yeah, basically, we had in mind
a different deal.

823
01:31:05,392 --> 01:31:08,691
I hear if you're flexible,
it keeps you young.

824
01:31:08,896 --> 01:31:12,957
I'll give up the gold.
Me and the girl Leave on the boat.

825
01:31:13,167 --> 01:31:17,763
-What if the gold’s on the boat?
-I gave up the gold. I had to.

826
01:31:18,105 --> 01:31:20,903
-You what?
-I had to!

827
01:31:21,709 --> 01:31:25,941
I hate to break your rice bowl,
but your wife made a deal.

828
01:31:26,146 --> 01:31:30,105
We get the gold, we Let you live.
What do you think?

829
01:31:30,317 --> 01:31:32,444
-Let me walk away?
-That's right.

830
01:31:32,653 --> 01:31:35,053
-Me and the girl?
-Well, not quite.

831
01:31:35,256 --> 01:31:36,848
I'm sorry, baby.

832
01:31:37,057 --> 01:31:41,255
Let's get this boat out of here!
She's got a commercial mind.

833
01:31:41,462 --> 01:31:45,694
-Hold on a second here!
-You're bust, pal. You're bust.

834
01:31:46,133 --> 01:31:50,229
-You got broke. Go cry a Little.
-You fortunate fucker.

835
01:31:50,404 --> 01:31:53,999
She don't step up, you stay here
Like a bit of forever.

836
01:31:54,208 --> 01:31:56,108
This way, you walk away.

837
01:31:56,310 --> 01:31:59,336
Take the gold! Just Leave me the boat!

838
01:31:59,546 --> 01:32:04,006
Don't make me lose my respect for you.
Get the gold off.

839
01:32:04,652 --> 01:32:07,985
Give him some money!
Leave him some money!

840
01:32:08,188 --> 01:32:11,749
Don't Let him go down there
with nothing.

841
01:32:12,493 --> 01:32:14,085
Give him some money!

842
01:32:14,295 --> 01:32:16,195
Yeah, that's right.

843
01:32:16,397 --> 01:32:20,163
We don't want to send you out broke.
Give me a shiv.

844
01:32:21,168 --> 01:32:23,068
Yeah.

845
01:32:26,173 --> 01:32:28,573
Buy yourself something nice.

846
01:32:28,776 --> 01:32:30,403
Pay you with gold.

847
01:32:30,611 --> 01:32:31,942
How you doing?

848
01:32:32,146 --> 01:32:34,307
You holding up?

849
01:32:34,581 --> 01:32:38,347
-The broad sold me out.
-How about that?

850
01:32:38,519 --> 01:32:40,578
Show them a pretty face...

851
01:32:40,988 --> 01:32:45,391
...a diamond necklace, and
they're gone Like morning mist.

852
01:33:05,546 --> 01:33:07,639
Find it!

853
01:33:10,050 --> 01:33:11,210
Where's the gold?

854
01:33:18,559 --> 01:33:20,424
Hurt him a Little.

855
01:33:26,867 --> 01:33:29,927
-Get him up.
-You son of a bitch!

856
01:33:31,338 --> 01:33:35,001
-You're just too hip to be happy.
-Is that so?

857
01:33:35,209 --> 01:33:37,575
You had to go and hit me.

858
01:33:38,479 --> 01:33:39,969
You all done?

859
01:33:40,180 --> 01:33:43,445
Because I got bills to pay.
Where's the gold?

860
01:33:43,650 --> 01:33:45,914
-Give me a cigarette.
-Bad for you.

861
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:48,452
Well, nobody Lives forever.

862
01:33:48,655 --> 01:33:52,056
But you're spending
the rest of your Life with me.

863
01:33:52,259 --> 01:33:53,851
Right now!

864
01:33:54,061 --> 01:33:57,588
-Where's the fucking gold?
-Kiss my Yankee ass!

865
01:33:58,465 --> 01:34:00,262
Okay.

866
01:34:00,467 --> 01:34:05,097
I hate to do anything as dramatic
as count to three. But one...

867
01:34:07,841 --> 01:34:09,240
...two....

868
01:34:09,443 --> 01:34:10,740
Hey!

869
01:34:11,845 --> 01:34:12,834
Damn it!

870
01:34:14,048 --> 01:34:15,242
What the fuck?

871
01:34:17,718 --> 01:34:20,016
Bobby! Bobby!

872
01:34:20,220 --> 01:34:23,883
-Coming at you!
-No shooting! Fuck!

873
01:34:24,091 --> 01:34:26,525
Stop! Put the fucking guns down!

874
01:34:26,727 --> 01:34:28,820
Are you listening to me? No!

875
01:34:29,029 --> 01:34:32,658
Stop! We're talking! Let's just talk!

876
01:34:32,866 --> 01:34:34,163
Stop! Just--

877
01:34:35,169 --> 01:34:36,864
Fuck, no!

878
01:34:40,174 --> 01:34:42,540
-Bobby!
-Come on, sit down!

879
01:34:42,743 --> 01:34:44,506
Sit down! No guns! No!

880
01:35:20,447 --> 01:35:22,381
I'm ready.

881
01:35:29,056 --> 01:35:30,956
Let's get the fuck out of here.

882
01:35:37,798 --> 01:35:39,891
How about that?

883
01:35:41,368 --> 01:35:43,836
How about that?

884
01:35:44,204 --> 01:35:46,195
How about that?

885
01:35:56,150 --> 01:35:58,744
Don't you want to hear my Last words?

886
01:35:58,952 --> 01:36:00,112
I just did.

887
01:36:57,844 --> 01:37:02,008
You put milk in, it lessens
the chance of stomach distress.

888
01:37:02,216 --> 01:37:05,674
I can't be worrying about
every Little thing.

889
01:37:05,886 --> 01:37:09,083
-How are you mending?
-Doing my best here.

890
01:37:09,289 --> 01:37:10,984
You?

891
01:37:13,594 --> 01:37:15,585
It's too bad about Pinky.

892
01:37:15,796 --> 01:37:16,820
What?

893
01:37:17,030 --> 01:37:21,364
-Pinky. Shame.
-Ain't that so?

894
01:37:21,868 --> 01:37:24,029
He always made me laugh.

895
01:37:24,238 --> 01:37:27,867
-What more can you ask of anyone?
-Nothing.

896
01:37:31,278 --> 01:37:35,146
You go to that plastic surgeon,
don't Let him put you under.

897
01:37:36,516 --> 01:37:39,610
I knew a cat,
went to get his face fixed.

898
01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:43,051
Woke up, and the sucker
gave him a pair of tits.

899
01:37:43,257 --> 01:37:45,157
That's a bad beat.

900
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:49,318
He landed back inside
and never wanted for cigarettes.

901
01:38:05,045 --> 01:38:06,808
Send your cut there?

902
01:38:07,514 --> 01:38:10,847
Wire it there.
When you get where you're going.

903
01:38:11,351 --> 01:38:13,148
That I will, pal.

904
01:38:13,353 --> 01:38:16,322
I hear it's nice down there
in the sun.

905
01:38:16,523 --> 01:38:18,753
Is that where I'm going?

906
01:38:18,959 --> 01:38:20,927
Wherever it is, brother...

907
01:38:21,128 --> 01:38:23,062
...don't come back.

908
01:38:31,204 --> 01:38:32,762
There.

909
01:38:41,948 --> 01:38:43,415
-Hey, baby.
-Hey.

910
01:38:43,617 --> 01:38:46,415
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay. Who was that?

911
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:49,885
Some guy, wanted a tip on a fight.

912
01:38:50,157 --> 01:38:51,351
Did you?

913
01:38:51,825 --> 01:38:57,457
I worked my whole Life. Why give him
the benefit of all that knowledge?

914
01:38:57,798 --> 01:38:59,060
Drive.

915
01:39:35,669 --> 01:39:38,638
Nothing Like a good plan, Joe.

916
01:39:39,973 --> 01:39:44,103
Yeah, I wouldn’t tie my shoes
without a backup plan.

917
01:39:45,912 --> 01:39:47,846
Shame about Pinky.

918
01:39:48,048 --> 01:39:51,074
It went bad, that Last bit, didn't it?

919
01:39:51,284 --> 01:39:55,220
-Yes, it did.
-Then that's just the price.

920
01:39:55,822 --> 01:39:57,722
That's right.

921
01:39:59,059 --> 01:40:01,186
That's part of it.

922
01:40:02,796 --> 01:40:05,356
-Didn't you do great, though?
-Did I?

923
01:40:05,565 --> 01:40:10,366
-You hot walked that dude all day.
-I went to a good school.

924
01:40:10,570 --> 01:40:13,698
-What's the rest of it?
-I don't get you.

925
01:40:13,907 --> 01:40:16,774
-We were talking about Pinky.
-Yeah?

926
01:40:17,844 --> 01:40:22,838
I said, "That's just the price,"
and you said, "That's part of it."

927
01:40:23,650 --> 01:40:25,447
What's the rest of it?

928
01:40:27,587 --> 01:40:29,282
Let me see your hands.

929
01:40:29,489 --> 01:40:32,117
That's right, real still.

930
01:40:33,460 --> 01:40:34,654
Yeah, well....

931
01:40:35,262 --> 01:40:37,355
Get over there.

932
01:40:41,134 --> 01:40:42,795
Keep walking.

933
01:40:43,003 --> 01:40:46,905
Well, you sent me to him.
You shouldn’t have sent me to him.

934
01:40:47,107 --> 01:40:51,066
-You can't think of everything.
-Where's the gold?

935
01:40:51,278 --> 01:40:53,109
It's right there.

936
01:40:53,313 --> 01:40:55,247
Why doesn't he shoot me?

937
01:40:55,449 --> 01:40:56,916
That's the deal.

938
01:40:57,117 --> 01:40:59,381
-He isn't gonna shoot me?
-No.

939
01:40:59,586 --> 01:41:02,453
Then he shouldn’t point a gun at me.

940
01:41:03,256 --> 01:41:05,451
It's insincere.

941
01:41:05,826 --> 01:41:07,794
Let's go.

942
01:41:09,362 --> 01:41:11,227
How you doing?

943
01:41:12,165 --> 01:41:13,393
Tired.

944
01:41:18,438 --> 01:41:21,271
-You'll be all right.
-You think so?

945
01:41:21,475 --> 01:41:23,602
You always are.

946
01:41:23,944 --> 01:41:25,775
Cute plan, though.

947
01:41:25,979 --> 01:41:28,709
Cute as a Chinese baby.

948
01:41:29,305 --> 01:41:35,637
