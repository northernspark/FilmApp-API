{301}{420}I deliver perfection...|and don't brag about it! :D
{446}{529}Long ago, in the faraway land|of ancient Greece...
{535}{598}there was a golden age|of powerful gods...
{604}{666}and extraordinary heroes.
{672}{741}And the greatest and strongest|of all these heroes...
{747}{810}was the mighty Hercules.
{816}{878}But what is the measure|of a true hero?
{884}{932}Ah, that is what our story is...
{938}{968}Will you listen to him?
{974}{1041}He's makin' the story|sound like some Greek tragedy.
{1047}{1079}Lighten up, dude.
{1085}{1130}We'll take it from here, darling.
{1136}{1210}You go, girl.
{1216}{1263}We are the muses...
{1269}{1353}goddesses of the arts|and proclaimers of heroes.
{1359}{1397}Heroes like Hercules.
{1403}{1446}Honey, you mean "Hunk-ules".
{1452}{1503}Ooh, I'd like to make|some sweet music with him...
{1509}{1571}Our story actually begins...
{1577}{1624}long before Hercules...
{1630}{1677}many eons ago.
{1683}{1717}{y:i}Ah
{1723}{1790}{y:i}Back when the world was new
{1796}{1858}- Whoa!|{y:i}- The planet Earth was down on its luck
{1864}{2012}{y:i}And everywhere gigantic brutes|{y:i}called Titans ran amok
{2018}{2084}{y:i}It was a nasty place
{2090}{2150}{y:i}There was a mess|{y:i}wherever ya stepped
{2156}{2265}{y:i}Where chaos reigned and earthquakes|{y:i}and volcanoes never slept
{2271}{2304}Whoo! Say it, girlfriend!
{2310}{2342}{y:i}And then along came Zeus
{2348}{2413}{y:i}- He hurled his thunderbolt|{y:i}- He zapped
{2419}{2498}{y:i}- Locked those suckers in a vault|{y:i}- They're trapped
{2504}{2591}{y:i}And on his own|{y:i}stopped chaos in its tracks
{2597}{2630}{y:i}And that's the gospel truth
{2636}{2740}{y:i}The guy was too "Type A"|{y:i}to just relax
{2746}{2812}{y:i}- And that's the world's first dish|- Yeah, baby.
{2818}{2887}{y:i}Zeus tamed the globe|{y:i}while still in his youth
{2893}{2954}{y:i}Though, honey|{y:i}it may seem impossible
{2960}{3034}{y:i}That's the gospel truth
{3040}{3092}{y:i}On Mount Olympus life was neat
{3098}{3168}{y:i}And smooth as sweet vermouth
{3174}{3247}{y:i}Although, honey|{y:i}it may seem impossible
{3253}{3403}{y:i}That's the gospel truth
{3409}{3498}{y:i}- Ah, ah|{y:i}- Ah
{3504}{3598}{y:i}- Ah, ah|{y:i}- Oh, yeah, yeah
{3604}{3695}{y:i}- Ah, ah|{y:i}- Hey, hey, hey

{5078}{5130}Yeah, you know, I had Orpheus|do the arrangement.
{5136}{5190}Isn't that too nutty?
{5196}{5261}Fabulous party. You know, I haven't|seen this much love in a room...
{5267}{5362}since Narcissus discovered himself.
{5383}{5441}Dear, keep those|away from the baby.
{5447}{5495}Oh, he won't hurt himself.

{6335}{6411}His name is Pegasus...
{6417}{6524}and he's all yours, son.

{7431}{7485}Hey, how you doin'?|Lookin' good. Nice dress.
{7491}{7549}So, Hades,|you finally made it.
{7555}{7594}How are things|in the underworld?
{7600}{7664}Well, they're just fine. You know,|a little dark, a little gloomy.
{7670}{7720}And, as always,|hey, full of dead people.
{7726}{7798}What are you gonna do? Ah!|There's the little sunspot.
{7804}{7896}Little snootchie. And here is a sucker|for the little sucker.
{7902}{7980}Eh? Here you go.|You just...

{8102}{8181}Come on, Hades. Don't be such a stiff.|Join the celebration!
{8187}{8242}Hey. Love to, babe...
{8248}{8312}but unlike you gods|lounging about up here...
{8318}{8372}I regrettably|have a full-time gig...

{8465}{8542}So, can't.|Love to, but can't.
{8548}{8634}You ought to slow down.|You'll work yourself to death.
{8640}{8746}Hah! Work yourself to death!

{12407}{12461}I got the concept.|So let me just ask:

{12544}{12601}- What do you think?|- Oh, no you don't.
{12607}{12703}We're not supposed|to reveal the future.
{12709}{12749}Oh, wait. I'm sorry.|Time out. Can I...
{12755}{12794}Can I ask you a question by the way?|Are you...
{12800}{12853}Did you cut your hair or something?|You look fabulous.
{12859}{12953}I mean, you look like a Fate|worse than death.
{12962}{13003}Oh, gross!
{13009}{13096}Yech! It's blinkin'!
{13108}{13195}Ladies, please.|My fate...

{13255}{13356}- Oh.|- Oh, all right.
{13387}{13492}In 18 years precisely...
{13498}{13555}the planets will align...
{13561}{13634}ever so nicely.
{13640}{13664}Ay, verse. Oy.
{13670}{13729}The time to act|will be at hand.
{13735}{13834}Unleash the Titans,|your monstrous band.
{13840}{13870}Mm-hmm. Good, good.
{13876}{14000}Then the once-proud Zeus|will finally fall...
{14006}{14075}and you, Hades...
{14081}{14151}will rule all!
{14157}{14216}Yes! Hades rules!
{14222}{14320}- A word of caution to this tale.|- Excuse me?
{14326}{14475}Should Hercules fight,|you will fail.
{14553}{14603}What?
{14609}{14712}Okay, fine, fine.|I'm cool. I'm fine.
{14716}{14798}Pain? Panic?|Got a little riddle for ya.
{14804}{14877}How do you kill a god?
{14883}{14919}I do not know!
{14925}{14962}You can't. They're immortal?
{14968}{15006}Bingo! They're immortal!
{15012}{15121}So, first you got to turn|the little sunspot...
{15127}{15209}mortal.
{15860}{15918}- Huh?|- Wha... What is it?
{15924}{16005}The baby!
{16101}{16236}Hercules! Oh!
{16256}{16389}No!
{16395}{16427}Now we did it!
{16433}{16481}Zeus is gonna use us|for target practice!
{16487}{16576}Just hang on to the kid, Panic!
{16633}{16705}Hurry! Let's just kill the kid|and get it over with, okay?
{16711}{16824}Here you go, kid.|A little Grecian formula.
{16825}{16915}Look at that! He's changing.|Can we do it now?
{16921}{16994}No, no, no. He has to drink|the whole potion.
{17000}{17112}- Every last drop!|- Who's there?
{17209}{17283}Alcmene, over here.
{17289}{17358}Oh, you poor thing.
{17364}{17407}- Oh, don't cry.|- Is anybody there?
{17413}{17491}- Now?|- Now.
{17497}{17571}Oh. Well, he must|have been abandoned.
{17577}{17635}Amphitryon, for so many years...
{17641}{17717}we've prayed to the gods|to bless us with a child.
{17723}{17775}Perhaps they've answered|our prayers.
{17781}{17815}Perhaps they have.
{17821}{17904}"Hercules"?
{18337}{18386}Help, help, help!
{18392}{18444}Hades is gonna kill us|when he finds out what happened.
{18450}{18510}You mean, if he finds out.
{18516}{18571}Of course he's gonna f...
{18577}{18666}If. If is good.
{18672}{18782}It was tragic. Zeus led all the gods|on a frantic search.
{18788}{18879}But by the time they found the baby,|it was too late.
{18885}{18994}{y:i}- Young Herc was mortal now|{y:i}- Mmm
{19000}{19083}{y:i}But since he did not drink|{y:i}the last drop
{19089}{19161}{y:i}He still retained|{y:i}his godlike strength
{19167}{19274}{y:i}- So thank his lucky stars|- Tell it, girl.
{19280}{19394}{y:i}- But Zeus and Hera wept|{y:i}- Ooh, ooh, ooh
{19400}{19485}{y:i}Because their son|{y:i}could never come home
{19491}{19551}{y:i}They'd have to watch|{y:i}their precious baby
{19557}{19650}{y:i}Grow up from afar
{19656}{19772}{y:i}Though Hades'horrid plan
{19778}{19853}{y:i}Was hatched before Herc|{y:i}cut his first tooth
{19859}{19957}{y:i}- Ahh|{y:i}- The boy grew stronger every day
{19963}{20060}{y:i}And that's the gospel truth
{20066}{20292}{y:i}The gospel truth
{20484}{20573}Hercules, slow down!
{20627}{20677}Look out!
{20683}{20721}Oops! S-S-Sorry, guys!
{20727}{20817}- Hey, watch where you're goin'!|- Sunday driver!
{20887}{20925}Thanks, son.
{20931}{21016}When old Penelope twisted her ankle|back there, I thought we were done for.
{21022}{21097}- No problem, Pop.|- Uh, don't-don't-don't unload just yet.
{21103}{21146}First, I have to finagle|with Phideas.
{21152}{21207}Okay.
{21213}{21259}Oops. Sorry, Penelope.
{21265}{21341}Now, Hercules, this time,|please just...
{21347}{21396}I know, I know.
{21402}{21457}Stay by the cart.
{21463}{21545}That's my boy.
{21607}{21641}Oh, my goodness. Whoa!
{21647}{21709}Careful!
{21715}{21770}- Why, thank you.|- No problem.
{21776}{21853}Why, Hercules! I-I-It's you!
{21859}{21944}- Let me, let me help you with that.|- No, no, no, no, no. I got it!
{21950}{21995}I'm fine.|You just run along.
{22001}{22039}- Are you sure?|- Oh, yes.
{22045}{22128}Absolutely.
{22180}{22233}Yo! Give it here!
{22239}{22308}Hey, you need an extra guy?
{22314}{22364}Uh, sorry, Herc.
{22370}{22429}Uh, we already got five...
{22435}{22475}and we want to keep it|an even number.
{22481}{22535}- Hey, wait a second. Five isn't an ev...|- See ya, Herc.
{22541}{22602}- What a geek!|- Destructo Boy.
{22608}{22708}- Maybe we should call him "Jerkules."|- Yeah!
{22835}{22870}Heads up!
{22876}{22960}- I-I got it!|- No! Stop!
{23001}{23099}Uh-oh. Oh, no.
{23105}{23180}It's okay.
{23311}{23396}Hey! Whoa!
{23499}{23567}- Son!|- Hang on, Pop! Be right back!
{23573}{23639}Oh, my! Oh, no! Don't!|Oh, no, no, no, no!
{23645}{23742}No, no, no, no, no, no!
{23836}{23914}Watch out!
{24244}{24322}Nice catch, Jerkules.
{24328}{24392}Son.
{24398}{24515}This is the last straw,|Amphitryon!
{24521}{24555}That boy is a menace!
{24561}{24668}He's too dangerous|to be around normal people!
{24668}{24720}He didn't mean any harm.|He's just a kid.
{24726}{24819}He-He just can't control|his strength.
{24825}{24926}I'm warning you.|You keep that-that-that...
{24932}{24968}freak away from here!
{24974}{25065}Freak! Yeah, go away!
{25348}{25447}Son, you shouldn't let those things|they said back there get to ya.
{25453}{25513}But, Pop, they're right.|I-I am a freak.
{25519}{25594}I-I try to fit in.|I really do.
{25600}{25666}I just can't.
{25672}{25752}Sometimes I feel like...
{25758}{25821}like I really|don't belong here...
{25827}{25940}like I'm supposed to be|someplace else.
{25946}{25993}Hercules, son...
{25999}{26081}I know it doesn't make any sense.
{26305}{26366}{y:i}I have often dreamed
{26372}{26423}{y:i}Of a far-off place
{26429}{26559}{y:i}Where a great, warm welcome|{y:i}will be waiting for me
{26565}{26615}{y:i}Where the crowds will cheer
{26621}{26682}{y:i}When they see my face
{26688}{26843}{y:i}And a voice keeps sayin'|{y:i}this is where I'm meant to be
{26849}{26911}{y:i}I will find my way
{26917}{26963}{y:i}I can go the distance
{26969}{27038}{y:i}I'll be there someday
{27044}{27096}{y:i}If I can be strong
{27102}{27158}{y:i}I know every mile
{27164}{27255}{y:i}Will be worth my while
{27261}{27422}{y:i}I would go most anywhere|{y:i}to feel like I
{27428}{27565}{y:i}Belong
{27608}{27678}Hercules, there's something|your mother and I...
{27684}{27771}have been meaning to, to tell ya.
{27777}{27871}But if you found me,|then where did I come from?
{27877}{27933}Why was I left here?
{27939}{28086}This was around your neck|when we found you.
{28104}{28148}It's the symbol of the gods.
{28154}{28237}This is it! Don't you see?|Maybe they have the answers.
{28243}{28332}I'll go to the temple of Zeus and...
{28358}{28436}Ma, Pop...
{28442}{28548}you're the greatest parents|anyone could have, but...
{28554}{28636}I-I gotta know.
{29046}{29109}{y:i}I am on my way
{29115}{29161}{y:i}I can go the distance
{29167}{29227}{y:i}I don't care how far
{29233}{29285}{y:i}Somehow, I'll be strong
{29291}{29343}{y:i}I know every mile
{29349}{29432}{y:i}Will be worth my while
{29438}{29506}{y:i}I would go most anywhere
{29512}{29690}{y:i}To find where I belong
{30111}{30158}Oh, mighty Zeus...
{30164}{30263}please, hear me|and, and answer my prayer.
{30269}{30341}I need to know:|Who am I?
{30347}{30444}Wh-Where do I belong?
{30552}{30635}Huh?
{30724}{30869}My boy.|My little Hercules.
{30900}{30951}Hey, hey, hey.|Hold on, kiddo!
{30957}{31008}What's your hurry?|After all these years...
{31014}{31095}is this the kind of hello|you give your father?
{31101}{31137}F-F-Father?
{31143}{31212}Didn't know you had|a famous father, did you?
{31218}{31284}Surprise!
{31290}{31336}Look how you've grown.
{31342}{31403}Why, you've got your mother's|beautiful eyes...
{31409}{31458}and my strong chin.
{31464}{31530}- Hah!|- I-I don't understand.
{31536}{31627}If you're my father,|that would make me a...
{31633}{31664}A god.
{31670}{31728}A god. A god!
{31734}{31791}Hey, you wanted answers,|and by thunder...
{31797}{31857}you're old enough now|to know the truth.
{31863}{31947}But why did you leave me on Earth?|Didn't you want me?
{31953}{32061}Of course we did. Your mother and I|loved you with all our hearts.
{32067}{32150}But someone stole you from us|and turned you mortal...
{32156}{32232}and only gods|can live on Mount Olympus.
{32238}{32271}And you can't do a thing?
{32277}{32322}I can't, Hercules,|but you can.
{32328}{32398}R-Really? W-What?|I'll do anything.
{32404}{32479}Hercules, if you can prove yourself|a true hero on Earth...
{32485}{32530}your godhood|will be restored.
{32536}{32602}A true hero. Great!
{32608}{32688}Uh, exactly how do you become|a true hero?
{32694}{32797}First, you must seek out Philoctetes,|the trainer of heroes.
{32803}{32868}Seek out Philoctetes.|Right. I'll...
{32874}{32922}- Whoa!|- Whoa! Hold your horses!
{32928}{33010}Which reminds me.
{33119}{33194}Ha-ha! You probably|don't remember Pegasus...
{33200}{33300}but you two go way back, son.
{33450}{33495}Oh, Pegasus!
{33501}{33545}He's a magnificent horse...
{33551}{33647}with the brain of a bird.
{33672}{33740}I'll find Philoctetes,|become a true hero!
{33746}{33774}That's the spirit!
{33780}{33881}I won't let you down, Father!|Yee-hah!
{33887}{33974}Good luck, son.
{34006}{34061}{y:i}I will beat the odds
{34067}{34109}{y:i}I can go the distance
{34115}{34167}{y:i}I will face the world
{34173}{34218}{y:i}Fearless, proud and strong
{34224}{34276}{y:i}I will please the gods
{34282}{34324}{y:i}I can go the distance
{34330}{34387}{y:i}Till I find my hero's welcome
{34393}{34466}{y:i}Right where I
{34472}{34813}{y:i}Belong
{35313}{35390}Whoa!
{35404}{35498}Y-You sure|this is the right place?
{35730}{35772}W-What's the matter, little guy?|You stuck?
{35778}{35876}- Whoa! Hey, butt out, buddy!|- Ugh!
{35882}{35940}Girls! Stop! Stop!|Come back! Come back, come back!
{35946}{36015}Whoa, whoa! Oh, jeez!
{36021}{36106}Wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa!|Oh, nymphs!
{36112}{36214}- They can't keep their hands off me.|- Hey!
{36277}{36324}What's the matter?|You never seen a satyr before?
{36330}{36391}Uh, no.|Can you help us?
{36397}{36508}We're looking for someone|called Philoctetes.
{36514}{36556}- Call me Phil.|- Phil!
{36562}{36616}- Ow!|- Boy, am I glad to meet you!
{36622}{36735}I'm Hercules,|and this is Pegasus.
{36740}{36801}Animals. Disgusting.
{36807}{36922}I need your help.|I want to become a hero, a true hero.
{36930}{36978}Sorry, kid.|Can't help ya.
{36984}{37023}- Wait.|- Whoo!
{37029}{37073}Uh, sorry. Why not?
{37079}{37186}Two words: I am retired.
{37192}{37231}Look, I gotta do this.
{37237}{37279}Haven't you ever had a dream...
{37285}{37385}something you wanted so bad|you'd do anything?
{37413}{37528}Kid, come inside.|I want to show you somethin'.
{37694}{37763}Watch it! That was part|of the mast of the "Argo".
{37769}{37806}- The "Argo"?|- Yeah.
{37812}{37894}Who do you think taught Jason|how to sail? Cleopatra?
{37900}{37956}I trained|all those would-be heroes.
{37962}{38074}Odysseus, Perseus, Theseus.|A lot of "yeuseus".
{38080}{38138}And every single one|of those bums let me down...
{38144}{38184}flatter than a discus.
{38190}{38258}None of'em|could go the distance.
{38264}{38329}And then there was Achilles.
{38335}{38377}Now there was a guy|who had it all...
{38383}{38425}the build, the foot speed.
{38431}{38475}He could jab.|He could take a hit.
{38481}{38536}He could keep on comin'.
{38542}{38601}But that "furshlugginer"|heel of his!
{38607}{38760}He barely gets nicked there once|and kaboom! He's history.
{38776}{38813}Yeah, I had a dream once.
{38819}{38898}I dreamed I was gonna train|the greatest hero there ever was.
{38904}{39001}So great, the gods would hang|a picture of him in the stars...
{39007}{39041}all across the sky...
{39047}{39132}and people would say,|"That's Phil's boy."
{39138}{39182}That's right.
{39188}{39231}Eh, but dreams are for rookies.
{39237}{39280}A guy can only take|so much disappointment.
{39286}{39333}But I'm different|than those other guys, Phil.
{39339}{39435}I can go the distance.|Come on. I'll show ya.
{39441}{39486}Jeez. You don't give up, do ya?
{39492}{39584}Watch this.
{39628}{39672}Holy Hera.
{39678}{39756}You know, maybe if I...|No! Snap out of it!
{39762}{39809}I'm too old to get mixed up|in this stuff again.
{39815}{39853}But if I don't become|a true hero...
{39859}{39929}I'll never be able|to rejoin my father Zeus.
{39935}{40005}Hold it.|Zeus is your father, right?
{40011}{40053}Uh-huh.
{40059}{40140}Zeus, the big guy.|He's your daddy.
{40146}{40238}Mr Lightning Bolts!|Read me a book, would ya, Da-Da?
{40244}{40310}Zeus!|"Once upon a time..."
{40316}{40416}- It's the truth!|- Please!
{40440}{40489}{y:i}So you wanna be a hero, kid
{40495}{40564}{y:i}Well, whoop-de-do
{40570}{40616}{y:i}I have been|{y:i}around the block before
{40622}{40675}{y:i}With blockheads just like you
{40681}{40732}{y:i}Each and every one|{y:i}a disappointment
{40738}{40819}{y:i}Pain for which|{y:i}there ain't no ointment
{40825}{40906}{y:i}So much for excuses|{y:i}Though a kid of Zeus is
{40912}{40989}{y:i}Askin'me to jump|{y:i}into the fray
{40995}{41098}{y:i}My answer is two words
{41135}{41165}Okay.
{41171}{41201}You mean you'll do it?
{41207}{41252}- You win.|- You won't be sorry, Phil.
{41258}{41310}- Oh, gods.|- So when do we start? Can we start now?
{41316}{41382}Oy, vay.
{41388}{41454}{y:i}I'd given up hope|{y:i}that someone would come
{41460}{41497}{y:i}Along
{41503}{41556}{y:i}A fella who'd ring the bell|{y:i}for once
{41562}{41611}{y:i}Not the gong
{41617}{41669}{y:i}The kind who wins trophies
{41675}{41728}{y:i}Won't settle for low fees
{41734}{41774}{y:i}At least semipro fees
{41780}{41847}{y:i}But, no|{y:i}I get the greenhorn
{41853}{41954}{y:i}I've been out to pasture, pal|{y:i}My ambition gone
{41960}{42070}{y:i}Content to spend lazy days|{y:i}and to graze my lawn
{42076}{42130}{y:i}But you need an advisor
{42136}{42188}{y:i}A satyr, but wiser
{42194}{42279}{y:i}A good merchandiser|{y:i}and... whoa
{42285}{42374}{y:i}There goes my ulcer|{y:i}I'm down to one last hope, and I hope
{42380}{42421}{y:i}It's you
{42427}{42536}{y:i}Though, kid, you're not|{y:i}exactly a dream come true
{42542}{42591}{y:i}I trained enough turkeys
{42597}{42650}- "Who never came through"|- Whoa!
{42656}{42742}{y:i}You're my one last hope|{y:i}so you'll have to do
{42748}{42835}Rule number six:|when rescuing a damsel...
{42841}{42926}always handle with care.
{42934}{43004}No!
{43010}{43114}Rule number 95, kid: concentrate!
{43129}{43181}Rule number 96:
{43187}{43234}aim!
{43240}{43289}{y:i}Demigods have faced the odds
{43295}{43346}{y:i}And ended up a mockery
{43352}{43387}{y:i}Don't believe the stories
{43393}{43471}{y:i}That you read|{y:i}on all the crockery
{43477}{43579}{y:i}To be a true hero, kid|{y:i}is a dyin' art
{43585}{43644}{y:i}Like paintin' a masterpiece
{43650}{43695}{y:i}It's a work of heart
{43701}{43751}{y:i}It takes more than sinew
{43757}{43812}{y:i}Comes down to what's in you
{43818}{43903}{y:i}You have to continue to grow
{43909}{43956}Now that's more like it!
{43962}{44018}{y:i}I'm down to one last shot
{44024}{44110}{y:i}And my last high note
{44116}{44238}{y:i}Before that blasted underworld|{y:i}gets my goat
{44244}{44284}{y:i}My dreams are on you, kid
{44290}{44338}{y:i}Go make 'em come true
{44344}{44384}{y:i}Climb that uphill slope
{44390}{44446}{y:i}Keep pushin' that envelope
{44452}{44490}{y:i}You're my one last hope
{44496}{44572}{y:i}And, kid, it's up to
{44578}{44668}{y:i}You
{44674}{44749}Yeah!
{44772}{44815}Did you see that?
{44821}{44898}Next stop, Olympus.
{44904}{44947}All right.|Just take it easy, champ.
{44953}{44999}I am ready.|I want to get off this island.
{45005}{45062}I want to see battles|and monsters.
{45068}{45110}Rescue some damsels.
{45116}{45164}You know, heroic stuff.
{45170}{45247}- Well.|- Aw, come on, Phil!
{45253}{45331}Well, okay, okay.|You want a road test? Saddle up, kid.
{45337}{45418}- We're goin' to Thebes!|- Ya-hoo!
{45424}{45484}- So what's in Thebes?|- A lot of problems.
{45490}{45600}It's a big, tough town.|Good place to start buildin' a rep.
{45626}{45661}Sounds like your basic DID...
{45667}{45772}- Hyah!|- Damsel in distress!
{45894}{45950}Not so fast, sweetheart.
{45956}{46010}I swear, Nessus.|Put me down or I'll...
{46016}{46103}Whoo!|I like 'em fiery!
{46109}{46177}Now remember, kid.|First, analyse the situation.
{46183}{46298}Don't just barrel in there|without thinking. Eh?
{46304}{46340}He's losin' points for this!
{46346}{46440}- You don't know what you're...|- Halt!
{46465}{46528}Step aside, two legs.
{46534}{46618}Pardon me, my good, uh, uh, sir.
{46624}{46666}I'll have to ask you to release|that young...
{46672}{46736}- Keep movin', junior.|- lady.
{46742}{46825}But you... Are-Aren't you|a damsel in distress?
{46831}{46902}I'm a damsel.|I'm in distress.
{46908}{46976}I can handle this.|Have a nice day.
{46982}{47024}Uh...
{47030}{47140}Ma'am, I'm afraid you may be too close|to the situation to realize...
{47144}{47225}Ohhh! What are you doin'?|Get your sword!
{47231}{47380}Sword. Right, right. Rule number 15:|a hero is only as good as his weapon!
{47530}{47603}Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold it! Hold on!|He's gotta do it on his own.
{47609}{47679}Come on, kid!|Concentrate!
{47685}{47748}Use your head!
{47754}{47828}Oh.
{47904}{47972}All right!|Not bad, kid!
{47978}{48076}Not exactly what I had in mind,|but not bad.
{48104}{48169}Oh, gee, miss.|I'm, I'm really sorry.
{48175}{48224}- Oh.|- That was dumb.
{48230}{48284}Yeah.
{48290}{48362}Excuse me.
{48458}{48531}Nice work! "Excelente".
{48537}{48584}Is Wonderboy here for real?
{48590}{48706}What are you talkin' about?|Of course he's real. Whoa!
{48712}{48820}And by the way, sweet cheeks.|I'm real too.
{48826}{48860}Ugh!
{48866}{48978}Yee-hah! Ya-hoo!
{49088}{49169}Whoa!
{49762}{49806}- How was that, Phil?|- Reign it in, rookie.
{49812}{49878}You can get away with mistakes|like those in the minor decathlons...
{49884}{49944}but this is the big leagues!
{49950}{49989}At least I beat him, didn't I?
{49995}{50076}Next time, don't let your guard down|because of a pair of big goo-goo eyes!
{50082}{50143}D-oh! It's like I keep tellin' ya.
{50149}{50254}You gotta stay focused,|and you...
{50441}{50515}Are you, uh, all right,|Miss, uh...
{50521}{50565}Megara.|My friends call me Meg.
{50571}{50613}At least they would|if I had any friends.
{50619}{50724}So did they give you a name|along with all those rippling pectorals?
{50730}{50821}Uh, uh, uh, I'm, um, uh...
{50827}{50883}- Uh, uh...|- Are you always this articulate?
{50889}{50982}Hercules. My...|My name is Hercules.
{50988}{51062}Herc... Huh.|I think I prefer Wonderboy.
{51068}{51165}So, uh, uh... How-how-how'd you|get mixed up with the, uh...
{51171}{51227}Pinhead with hooves?|Well, you know how men are.
{51233}{51364}They think "No" means "Yes" and|"Get lost" means "Take me. I'm yours."
{51387}{51466}Don't worry. Shorty here|can explain it to ya later.
{51472}{51522}Well, thanks for everything, Herc.
{51528}{51593}It's been a real slice.
{51599}{51711}Wait! Um, can we give you a ride?
{51752}{51835}Uh, I don't think your pinto|likes me very much.
{51841}{51903}Pegasus? Oh, no.|Don't be silly.
{51909}{52012}He'd be more than happy to... Ow!
{52017}{52080}I'll be all right.|I'm a big tough girl.
{52086}{52175}I tie my own sandals|and everything.
{52192}{52249}Bye-bye, Wonderboy.
{52255}{52312}Bye.
{52318}{52391}She's somethin'.|Isn't she, Phil?
{52397}{52460}Yeah, ye... Oh, yeah.|She's really somethin'.
{52466}{52537}A real pain in the patella!|Earth to Herc!
{52543}{52575}Come in, Herc!|Come in, Herc!
{52581}{52640}We got a job to do, remember?
{52646}{52685}Thebes is still waitin'.
{52691}{52786}Yeah. Yeah. I know.
{53023}{53064}Aw, how cute.
{53070}{53134}A couple of rodents|lookin' for a theme park.
{53140}{53179}Who you callin' a rodent, sister?
{53185}{53253}- I'm a bunny!|- A-And I'm his gopher!
{53259}{53303}Ta-dah!
{53309}{53361}I thought I smelled a rat.
{53367}{53435}- Meg.|- Speak of the devil.
{53441}{53536}Meg, my little flower, my little bird,|my little nut. Meg.
{53542}{53584}What exactly happened here?
{53590}{53652}I thought you were gonna persuade|the river guardian to join my team...
{53658}{53742}for the uprising, and here I am,|kind of river guardian-less.
{53748}{53842}I gave it my best shot, but|he made me an offer I had to refuse.
{53848}{53901}Fine. So instead of subtracting|two years from your sentence...
{53907}{53952}hey, I'm gonna add two on, okay?
{53958}{54006}- Give that your best shot.|- Look. It wasn't my fault.
{54012}{54074}It was this wonderboy, Hercules.
{54080}{54160}Hercules.|Why does that name ring a bell?
{54166}{54232}I don't know.|Um, maybe we owe him money?
{54238}{54345}- What was that name again?|- Hercules.
{54351}{54394}He comes on with this big,|innocent farm boy routine...
{54400}{54443}but I could see through that|in a Peloponnesian minute.
{54449}{54540}Wait a minute. Wasn't Hercules the name|of that kid we were supposed to...
{54546}{54623}Oh, my gods!|Run for it!
{54629}{54707}So you took care of him, huh?
{54713}{54757}Dead as a doornail.
{54763}{54829}Weren't those your exact words?
{54835}{54874}This might be|a different Hercules.
{54880}{54966}Yeah! I mean, Hercules|is a very popular name nowadays!
{54972}{55050}Remember, like, a few years ago,|every other boy was named Jason...
{55056}{55090}and the girls|were all named Brittany?
{55096}{55204}I'm about to rearrange|the cosmos...
{55210}{55287}and the one schlemiel|who can louse it up...
{55293}{55410}is waltzing around in the woods!
{55478}{55517}Wait. Wait, big guy.
{55523}{55589}- We can still cut in on his waltzing.|- That's right.
{55595}{55658}And-And at least we made him mortal.|That's a good thing.
{55664}{55694}Didn't we?
{55700}{55776}Hmm. Fortunately|for the three of you...
{55782}{55872}we still have time to correct|this rather egregious oversight.
{55878}{56003}And this time, no foul-ups.
{56033}{56095}Wow!
{56101}{56183}- Is that all one town?|- One town, a million troubles.
{56189}{56228}The one and only Thebes.
{56234}{56286}The Big Olive itself.
{56292}{56398}If you can make it there,|you can make it anywhere.
{56539}{56646}Stick with me, kid.|The city is a dangerous place.
{56652}{56739}- Look where you're goin', numbskull!|- Hey, I'm walkin' here!
{56745}{56798}See what I mean?|I'm tellin' you. Wackos.
{56804}{56881}Pita bread. Pita bread.|Get your pita bread here.
{56887}{56950}- Hey, Mack.|- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
{56956}{57000}You wanna buy a sundial?
{57006}{57052}He's not interested, all right?|Come on, kid.
{57058}{57131}The end is coming!|Can't you feel it?
{57137}{57200}Yes, yes.|Thank you for the info. Yes.
{57206}{57260}We'll ponder that for awhile.|Just stare at the sidewalk.
{57266}{57296}Come on.|Don't make eye contact.
{57302}{57383}People here are nuts. That's because|they live in a city of turmoil.
{57389}{57494}Trust me, kid. You're gonna be|just what the doctor ordered.
{57496}{57600}It was tragic!|We lost everything in the fire.
{57606}{57704}Everything|except old Snowball here.
{57710}{57771}Now were the fires|before or after the earthquake?
{57777}{57819}They were after the earthquake.|I remember.
{57825}{57858}But before the flood.
{57864}{57938}Don't even get me started|on the crime rate.
{57944}{58030}Thebes has certainly|gone downhill in a hurry.
{58036}{58073}Tell me about it.
{58079}{58124}It seems like every time|I turn around...
{58130}{58177}there's some new monster|wreakin' havoc and I...
{58183}{58296}All we need now|is a plague of locusts.
{58319}{58385}That's it!|I'm movin' to Sparta!
{58391}{58447}Excuse me.
{58453}{58491}It, uh...
{58497}{58611}seems to me that|what you folks need is a hero.
{58617}{58700}Yeah, and who are you?
{58714}{58763}I'm Hercules, and, uh...
{58769}{58851}I happen to be a hero.
{58857}{58902}- Is that so?|- A hero!
{58908}{58960}Have you ever saved|a town before?
{58966}{59018}Uh, no. Uh, not exactly, but I...
{59024}{59080}Have you ever reversed|a natural disaster?
{59086}{59138}Well, uh, no.
{59144}{59234}Oh, listen to thi... He's just another|chariot chaser. This we need.
{59240}{59270}That's a laugh.

{59338}{59383}This kid is the genuine article.
{59389}{59488}Hey, isn't that the goat-man|who trained Achilles?
{59494}{59529}Watch it, pal.
{59535}{59640}Yeah, you're right.|Hey, uh, nice job on those heels!

{59964}{60048}Young man, we need|a professional hero...
{60054}{60126}not an amateur.
{60132}{60219}Well, wait. Stop!
{60301}{60350}How am I supposed|to prove myself a hero...
{60356}{60394}if nobody|will give me a chance?
{60400}{60430}You'll get your chance.
{60436}{60525}You just need some kind|of catastrophe or disaster.
{60531}{60615}Please. Help! Please!|There's been a terrible accident!
{60621}{60675}- Meg?|- Speakin' of disasters.
{60681}{60740}Wonderboy! Hercules!
{60746}{60787}- Thank goodness.|- Wha-Wha-What's wrong?
{60793}{60823}Oh! Outside of town.
{60829}{60880}Two little boys.|Th-They were playing in the gorge.
{60886}{60945}Th-There was this rock slide,|a terrible rock slide.
{60951}{61014}- They're trapped!|- Kids? Trapped?
{61020}{61055}Phil, this is great!
{61061}{61103}You're really choked up|about this, aren't ya?
{61109}{61158}- Come on!|- No, I... You don't under...
{61164}{61276}I, I have this terrible fear|of heights!
{61364}{61425}I'm right behind ya, kid! Whoo!
{61431}{61494}I'm way behind ya, kid.
{61500}{61572}I got a fur wedgie.
{61700}{61740}- Are you okay?|- I'll be fine.
{61746}{61794}Just get me down|before I ruin the upholstery.
{61800}{61843}Help! I can't breathe!
{61849}{61893}- Hurry!|- Get us out!
{61899}{61955}We're suffocating!
{61961}{62034}Somebody call IX-I-I!
{62040}{62077}Easy, fellas.|You'll be all right.
{62083}{62119}We can't last much longer!
{62125}{62223}Get us out before we get crushed!
{62644}{62690}- How you boys doin'?|- We're okay now.
{62696}{62781}Jeepers, mister.|You're really strong.
{62787}{62869}Well, just try to be a little|more careful next time, okay, kids?
{62875}{62982}We sure will.
{63054}{63087}Stirring performance, boys.
{63093}{63161}I was really moved.
{63167}{63222}"Jeepers, mister"?
{63228}{63301}I was going for innocence.
{63307}{63399}And, hey, two thumbs way,|way up for our leading lady.
{63405}{63452}What a dish.|What a doll.
{63458}{63524}Get outta there, ya big lug,|while ya still can.
{63530}{63578}Phil, I-I did great.
{63584}{63666}They even applauded. Sort of.
{63666}{63719}Huh! I hate|to burst your bubble, kid...
{63725}{63808}but that ain't applause.
{63932}{64014}Ph-Ph-Ph-Phil?|What do you call that thing?
{64020}{64077}Two words:
{64083}{64158}am-scray!
{64193}{64316}Let's get ready to rumble!
{64452}{64502}That's it. Dance around!|Dance around!
{64508}{64586}Watch the teeth! Watch the teeth!|Keep going. Come on. Come on.
{64592}{64700}Lead with your left.|Lead with your left. Your other left!
{65298}{65389}Whoa!
{65966}{66040}All right! All right!|You're bad! Okay!
{66046}{66145}See, Phil?|That... That wasn't so hard.
{66151}{66226}Kid, kid, kid.|How many horns do you see?
{66232}{66278}- Six?|- Eh, close enough.
{66284}{66367}Let's get you cleaned up.
{66432}{66584}Guys, guys, relax.|It's only halftime.
{66623}{66704}That doesn't sound good.
{66854}{66928}Definitely not good!
{67586}{67696}Will you forget|the head-slicing thing?
{67842}{67948}Phil, I don't think we covered this one|in basic training!
{68193}{68300}My favourite part of the game:
{68330}{68408}sudden death.
{68880}{68970}Oh. There goes another one.
{68976}{69066}Just like Achilles.
{69080}{69122}Game...
{69128}{69253}set, match.
{69288}{69376}Hmm?
{69770}{69836}Phil, you gotta admit.
{69842}{69894}That was pretty heroic.
{69900}{70041}Ya did it, kid! Ya did it!|Ya won by a landslide!
{70081}{70164}Hades mad.
{70188}{70284}Well, what do you know?
{70358}{70440}From that day forward,|our boy Hercules could do no wrong.
{70446}{70529}He was so hot,|steam looked cool.
{70535}{70609}{y:i}Oh, yeah
{70615}{70674}{y:i}Bless my soul|{y:i}Herc was on a roll
{70680}{70747}{y:i}Person of the week|{y:i}in every Greek opinion poll
{70753}{70815}{y:i}- What a pro|{y:i}- Herc could stop a show

{71035}{71096}{y:i}Here was a kid|{y:i}with his act down pat
{71102}{71167}{y:i}Zero to hero in no time flat
{71173}{71234}{y:i}- Zero to hero|{y:i}- Just like that
{71240}{71306}{y:i}When he smiled|{y:i}the girls went wild
{71312}{71369}{y:i}With oohs and aahs
{71375}{71440}{y:i}And they slapped his face|{y:i}on every vase
{71446}{71511}{y:i}On every "vahse"
{71517}{71576}{y:i}From appearance fees|{y:i}and royalties
{71582}{71641}{y:i}Our Herc had cash to burn
{71647}{71710}{y:i}Now nouveau riche and famous
{71716}{71797}{y:i}He could tell you|{y:i}what's a Grecian urn
{71803}{71866}{y:i}Say amen|{y:i}There he goes again
{71872}{71933}{y:i}- Sweet and undefeated|{y:i}- And an awesome ten for ten
{71939}{71996}{y:i}Folks lined up|{y:i}just to watch him flex
{72002}{72077}{y:i}And this perfect package|{y:i}packed a pair of pretty pecs
{72083}{72147}{y:i}Hercie, he comes|{y:i}He sees, he conquers
{72153}{72217}{y:i}Honey, the crowds|{y:i}were goin' bonkers
{72223}{72279}{y:i}- He showed the moxie brains and spunk|{y:i}- Yeah
{72285}{72356}{y:i}- From zero to hero|{y:i}- A major hunk
{72362}{72457}{y:i}- Zero to hero|{y:i}- And who'd have thunk
{72509}{72552}{y:i}Who put the glad in gladiator
{72558}{72594}{y:i}Hercules
{72600}{72655}{y:i}Whose darin'deeds|{y:i}are great theatre
{72661}{72694}{y:i}Hercules
{72700}{72742}{y:i}- Isn't he bold|{y:i}- No one braver
{72748}{72795}{y:i}- Is he sweet|{y:i}- Our favourite flavour
{72801}{72843}{y:i}- Hercules|{y:i}- My man.

{73144}{73201}{y:i}- Undefeated|{y:i}- Riding high
{73207}{73277}{y:i}- And the nicest guy.|{y:i}- Not conceited
{73283}{73328}{y:i}- He was a nothing|{y:i}- A zero, zero
{73334}{73375}{y:i}- Now he's a honcho|{y:i}- He's our hero
{73381}{73450}{y:i}He hit the heights|{y:i}at breakneck speed
{73456}{73507}{y:i}From zero to hero
{73513}{73555}{y:i}Herc is a hero
{73561}{73681}{y:i}Now he's a hero
{73687}{73773}{y:i}Yes, indeed
{73808}{73893}Pull!
{73933}{73975}Nice shootin', Rex.
{73981}{74052}I can't believe this guy.|I throw everything I've got at him...
{74058}{74114}and it doesn't even...
{74120}{74207}What are those?
{74213}{74303}Um, I don't know.|I-I thought they looked kinda dashing.
{74309}{74395}I've got 24 hours|to get rid of this bozo...
{74401}{74528}or the entire scheme I've been setting|up for 18 years goes up in smoke...
{74534}{74696}and you are wearing|his merchandise?
{74844}{74938}Thirsty?
{75137}{75258}Looks like your game's over. Wonderboy|is hitting every curve you throw at him.
{75264}{75339}Oh, yeah.
{75345}{75414}I wonder if maybe|I haven't been throwing...
{75420}{75547}the right curves at him,|Meg, my sweet.
{75553}{75595}Don't even go there.
{75601}{75650}See, he's gotta have|a weakness...
{75656}{75705}because everybody's|got a weakness.
{75711}{75765}I mean, for what?|Pandora, it was the box thing.
{75771}{75832}For the Trojans, hey.|They bet on the wrong horse, okay?
{75838}{75900}We simply need|to find out Wonderboy's.
{75906}{75956}I've done my part.|Get your little imps...
{75962}{76003}They couldn't handle him|as a baby.
{76009}{76070}I need somebody|who can handle him as a man.
{76076}{76115}Hey, I've sworn off manhandling.
{76121}{76171}Well, you know, that's good|because that's what got you...
{76177}{76219}into this jam in the first place,|isn't it?
{76225}{76303}You sold your soul to me|to save your boyfriend's life.
{76309}{76366}And how does this creep thank you?
{76372}{76444}By running off|with some babe.
{76450}{76492}He hurt you real bad,|didn't he, Meg? Huh?
{76498}{76545}Look, I learned my lesson, okay?
{76551}{76604}Which is exactly why|I got a feelin'...
{76610}{76654}you're gonna leap|at my new offer.
{76660}{76729}You give me the key|to bringing down Wonder Breath...
{76735}{76818}and I give you the thing|that you crave most...
{76824}{76889}in the entire cosmos:
{76895}{77005}your freedom.
{77036}{77077}You should|have been there, Father.
{77083}{77128}I mangled the Minotaur...
{77134}{77195}grappled with the Gorgon.
{77201}{77258}Just like Phil told me.|I analysed the situation...
{77264}{77359}controlled my strength|and kicked.
{77380}{77462}The crowds went wild!
{77482}{77549}- Thank you. Thank you.|- Hah!
{77555}{77647}You're doing great, son.|You're doing your old man proud.
{77653}{77699}I'm glad to hear you|say that, Father.
{77705}{77757}I've been waiting|for this day a long time.
{77763}{77823}Hmm. What day is that, son?
{77829}{77900}The day I rejoin the gods.
{77906}{77986}You've done wonderfully.|You really have, my boy.
{77992}{78034}You're just not there yet.
{78040}{78128}You haven't proven yourself|a true hero.
{78134}{78211}But, Father, I've beaten every|single monster I've come up against.
{78217}{78292}I-I'm-I'm the most famous person|in all of Greece.
{78298}{78387}I'm-I-I'm an action figure!
{78393}{78454}I'm afraid being famous|isn't the same...
{78460}{78538}as being a true hero.
{78544}{78575}What more can I do?
{78581}{78655}It's something you have|to discover for yourself.
{78661}{78801}- But how can I...|- Look inside your heart.
{78801}{78884}Father, wait!
{79230}{79275}On your left|is Hercules' villa.
{79281}{79333}Our next stop|is the Pecs and Flex Gift Shop...
{79339}{79411}where you can pick up the great hero's|30-minute workout scroll...
{79417}{79460}"Buns of Bronze."
{79466}{79516}At 1:00, you got a meeting|with King Augeas.
{79522}{79559}He's got a problem|with his stables.
{79565}{79602}I'd advise you|not to wear your new sandals.
{79608}{79661}- Phil.|- I told you, don't move!
{79667}{79713}DGR, the Daughters|of the Greek Revolution.
{79719}{79778}- At 3:00, you gotta get a girdle|from some Amazons.|- Phil.
{79784}{79893}Phil, what's the point?
{79905}{79935}That's it!
{79941}{80024}Keep your toga on, pal.
{80041}{80117}Yuck! What do you mean,|"What's the point?"
{80123}{80156}You wanna go to Olympus,|don't ya?
{80162}{80258}Yeah, but this stuff doesn't seem|to be getting me anywhere.
{80264}{80326}You can't give up now.|I'm countin' on ya.
{80332}{80416}I gave this everything I had.
{80439}{80505}Listen to me, kid.|I seen 'em all.
{80511}{80606}And I am tellin' you...|and this is the honest-to-Zeus truth...
{80612}{80657}you got somethin'|I never seen before.
{80663}{80705}- Really?|- I can feel it...
{80711}{80769}right down in these stubby|bowlegs of mine.
{80775}{80884}There is nothin'|you can't do, kid.
{80889}{80935}- It's him!|- Hey, watch it!
{80941}{80970}- Watch it! Watch...|- I touched his elbow!
{80976}{81043}- Hey, girls!|- I got his sweatband!
{81049}{81100}Phil, help!
{81106}{81185}- Okay. Escape plan: beta.|- Gotcha.
{81191}{81279}- Hey! Where is he?|- There he goes! On the veranda!
{81285}{81368}Whoa!
{81684}{81762}Let's see. What could be behind|curtain number one?
{81768}{81804}Meg!
{81810}{81871}It's all right.|The sea of raging hormones has ebbed.
{81877}{81937}Gee, i-i-it's|great to see you.
{81943}{81987}I-I-I missed you.
{81993}{82049}So this is what heroes do|on their days off.
{82055}{82103}Nah. I'm no hero.
{82109}{82160}Sure ya are.|Everybody in Greece...
{82166}{82246}thinks you're the greatest thing|since they put the pocket in pita.
{82252}{82327}I know, it's... it's crazy. You know, I|can't go anywhere without being mobbed.
{82333}{82390}- I mean...|- You sound like you could use a break.
{82396}{82509}Think your nanny goat would go berserk|if you played hookey this afternoon?
{82515}{82590}Oh, gee, I-I don't know. Uh, Phil's got|the rest of the day pretty much booked.
{82596}{82639}Ah, Phil, schmill.
{82645}{82704}Just follow me out the window,|round the dumbbells.
{82710}{82812}You lift up the back wall|and we're gone.
{82904}{82952}Wow. What a day.
{82958}{83002}First that restaurant by the bay.
{83008}{83087}And then that, that play,|that, that, that Oedipus thing.
{83093}{83189}Man! I thought I had problems.
{83212}{83330}- Psst! Stop foolin' around.|- Yeah. Get the goods, sister.
{83336}{83416}I didn't know that playing hookey|could be so much fun.
{83422}{83482}Yeah, neither did I.
{83488}{83564}- Thanks, Meg.|- Oh.
{83570}{83618}Don't thank me just yet.
{83624}{83680}- Oh!|- Oop. Careful.
{83686}{83730}Sorry. Weak ankles.
{83736}{83834}Oh, yeah? Well, maybe you better|sit down for a while.
{83840}{83934}So, uh, do you|have any problems...
{83940}{83985}with things like this?
{83991}{84059}- Uh...|- Weak ankles, I mean.
{84065}{84130}Oh, uh, no, not really.
{84136}{84225}No weaknesses whatsoever?
{84231}{84295}- No trick knee?|- Uh...
{84301}{84399}Ruptured disks?
{84414}{84530}No. I'm, I'm, I'm afraid|I'm, uh, fit as a fiddle.
{84536}{84662}- Wonderboy, you are perfect.|- Thanks.
{84668}{84754}Whoops!
{84760}{84807}It looks better that way.
{84813}{84908}No, it really does.
{85032}{85080}You know, when, when I was a kid...
{85086}{85186}I, I would have given anything to be|exactly like everybody else.
{85192}{85250}You wanted to be|petty and dishonest?
{85256}{85343}- Everybody's not like that.|- Yes, they are.
{85349}{85425}- You're not like that.|- How do you know what I'm like?
{85431}{85473}All I know is...
{85479}{85638}you're the most amazing person with|weak ankles I've ever met.
{85686}{85724}Oh!
{85730}{85786}Meg, when I'm with you...
{85792}{85894}I-I don't feel so alone.
{85900}{85956}Sometimes it's better|to be alone.
{85962}{86081}- What do you mean?|- Nobody can hurt you.
{86134}{86253}Meg? I would never ever hurt you.
{86259}{86319}And I don't wanna|hurt you, so...
{86325}{86382}let's both do|ourselves a favour and...
{86388}{86501}stop this before we...
{86507}{86597}All right! Break it up!|Break it up! Party's over!
{86603}{86666}- I've been lookin' all over this town!|- Calm down, mutton man.
{86672}{86729}- It was all my fault.|- You're already on my list, sister!
{86735}{86824}So don't make it worse!
{86843}{86906}And as for you, ya bum,|you're gonna go to the stadium...
{86912}{86962}and you're gonna be put through|the workout of your life!
{86968}{87067}- Now get on the horse.|- Okay, okay.
{87073}{87175}- I'm sorry.|- Ah, he'll get over it.
{87274}{87382}Move! Move, move,|move, move, move! Move!
{87483}{87540}Hey, watch it. Watch it.|Watch it.
{87546}{87637}Keep your goo-goo eyes on the...
{87652}{87792}That's it. Next time, I drive.
{87924}{87995}Oh, what's the matter with me?
{88001}{88086}You'd think a girl would learn.
{88092}{88193}{y:i}If there's a prize|{y:i}for rotten judgment
{88199}{88290}{y:i}I guess I've already won that

{91649}{91711}I must have had a chunk of brimstone|wedged in my ear or something.
{91717}{91815}Then read my lips! Forget it.
{91821}{91926}Meg, Meg, Meg,|my sweet deluded little minion.
{91932}{92041}Aren't we forgetting one teensy-weensy,|but ever so crucial little, tiny detail?
{92047}{92089}I own you!
{92095}{92206}- Oh, oh, I got another horn here.|- You work for me.
{92212}{92267}That kid's gonna be|doin' laps for a month.
{92273}{92343}If I say, "Sing,"|you say, "Hey, name that tune."
{92349}{92454}If I say, "I want Wonderboy's head|on a platter," you say...
{92460}{92502}Medium or well done?
{92508}{92613}Oh! I knew that dame was trouble.|This is gonna break the kid's heart.
{92619}{92692}- I'll work on that.|- I'm sorry. You hear that sound?
{92698}{92806}That's the sound of your freedom|fluttering out the window forever.
{92812}{92902}I don't care.|I'm not gonna help you hurt him.
{92908}{93002}I can't believe you're getting|so worked up about some guy.
{93008}{93062}This one is different.|He's honest and, and he's sweet.
{93068}{93110}- Please!|- He would never do anything to hurt me.
{93116}{93228}-He's a guy.|-Besides, O Oneness, you can't beat him.
{93234}{93337}He has no weaknesses.|He's gonna...
{93343}{93425}I think he does, Meg.
{93431}{93558}I truly think he does.
{94060}{94168}- Hey, Phil, what happened to you?|- Kid, we gotta talk.
{94174}{94242}Oh, Phil, I just had|the greatest day of my life.
{94248}{94324}I, I, I can't stop thinkin'|about Meg.

{95386}{95414}Will you just knock it off|for a couple of seconds?
{95420}{95478}Rule number 38. Come on, Phil.|Keep them up there, huh?
{95484}{95552}- Phil, I got two words for ya: duck!|- Listen to me. She's...
{95558}{95593}- My dream come true?|- Not exactly.
{95599}{95642}- More beautiful than Aphrodite?|- Aside from that!
{95648}{95743}- The most wonderful...|- She's a... She's a fraud!
{95749}{95806}She's been playin' ya for a sap!

{96489}{96587}I'm hoppin' the first barge outta here.|I'm goin' home.
{96593}{96642}Fine! G...
{96648}{96757}Go! I don't... I don't need you.
{96774}{96850}I thought you were gonna be|the all-time champ...
{96856}{96973}not the all-time chump.
{96980}{97086}Jeez Louise,|what got his goat, huh?
{97119}{97163}Baboom. Name is Hades,|lord of the dead.
{97169}{97214}- Hi. How ya doin'?|- Uh, not now, okay?

{97356}{97402}And, Herc, you little devil you.|May I call you Herc?
{97408}{97462}You seem to be constantly|getting in the way of it, huh?
{97468}{97526}- You've got the wrong guy.|- Hear me out, ya little...
{97532}{97577}Just hear me out, okay?
{97583}{97646}So I would be eternally grateful|if you would just...
{97652}{97706}take a day off from|this hero business of yours.
{97712}{97756}Jeez, I mean, monsters,|natural disasters.
{97762}{97802}- You wait a day, huh?|- You're out of your mind.
{97808}{97946}Not so fast, because, ya see,|I do have a little leverage|you might wanna know about.
{97952}{98042}- Meg!|- Don't listen, Herc...
{98048}{98096}- Let her go!|- Here's the trade-off.
{98102}{98167}You give up your strength|for about 24 hours, okay?
{98173}{98222}Say, the next 24 hours.
{98228}{98271}And Meg here is free as a bird|and safe from harm.
{98277}{98326}We dance, we kiss, we schmooze,|we carry on, we go home happy.
{98332}{98389}What do ya say? Come on.
{98395}{98437}People are... are gonna|get hurt, aren't they?
{98443}{98488}Nah! I mean, it's, you know,|it's a possibility.
{98494}{98536}It happens 'cause, you know, it's war,|but what can I tell ya?
{98542}{98585}Anyway, what do you|owe these people, huh?
{98591}{98657}Isn't Meg...|you little smoochy face you...|Isn't she more important than they are?
{98663}{98707}- Stop it!|- Isn't she?
{98713}{98774}You've gotta swear|she'll be safe from any harm.
{98780}{98824}Fine, okay.|I'll give you that one.
{98830}{98878}Meg is safe, otherwise|you get your strength right back.
{98884}{98931}Yadda, yadda. Fine print. Boilerplate.|Baboom. Okay? We're done.
{98937}{98979}What do you say we shake on it?
{98985}{99032}Hey, I really don't have,|like, time to bat this around.
{99038}{99081}I'm kind of on a schedule here.|I got plans for August. Okay?

{99161}{99289}- All right!|- Yes! We're there! Bam!
{99428}{99494}You may feel just a little queasy.|It's kind of natural.
{99500}{99587}Maybe you should sit down!
{99604}{99691}Now you know how it feels to be|just like everybody else.
{99697}{99777}Isn't it just peachy?
{99783}{99835}Oh! You'll love this.|One more thing.
{99841}{99902}Meg, babe, a deal's a deal.
{99908}{99982}You're off the hook.|And by the way, Herc,
{99988}{100036}is she not, like,|a fabulous little actress?
{100042}{100074}- Stop it.|- What do you mean?
{100080}{100177}I mean your little chickie-poo here|was working for me all the time.
{100183}{100270}- Duh.|- You're... You're lying!
{100276}{100390}- Help!|-Jeepers, mister, you're really strong.
{100396}{100489}- Couldn't have done it without you,|sugar, sweetheart, babe.|- No! It's... It's not like that.
{100495}{100610}I didn't mean to...|I-I couldn't... I... I'm so sorry.
{100616}{100748}Our hero's a zero!|Our hero's a zero!
{100759}{100851}Well, gotta blaze. There's a whole|cosmos up there waiting for me...
{100857}{100941}with, hey, my name on it.
{100959}{101090}So much for the preliminaries,|and now on to the main event!

{106784}{106895}- He won't listen to me.|- Good! He's finally learned somethin'.
{106901}{106998}Look, I know what I did was wrong,|but this isn't about me. It's about him.
{107004}{107082}If you don't help him now,|Phil, he'll die.
{107088}{107137}I need more thunderbolts!
{107143}{107246}Uh, Hephaestus has been captured,|my lord. Everyone's been captured.
{107252}{107377}I've been captured.|Hey, hey, watch the glasses.

{109435}{109519}What's happening?
{109525}{109610}H-Hades' deal is broken.
{109616}{109683}He promised I wouldn't get hurt.
{109689}{109809}Meg, why... why... why did ya...|You didn't have to...
{109815}{109914}Oh, people always|do crazy things...
{109920}{109978}when they're in love.

{111984}{112052}- Thank you, my boy.|- Nice horsey!
{112058}{112211}My intentions were pure.|I really was attracted to you.
{112220}{112343}- Throw!|- Ah! Now watch your old man work!
{112349}{112431}Uh-oh!
{112467}{112524}Guys, get your|titanic rears in gear...
{112530}{112605}and kick some Olympian butt.
{112611}{112715}Whoa! Is my hair out?
{113308}{113410}Thanks a ton, Wonderboy. But at least|I've got one swell consolation prize...
{113416}{113519}a friend of yours|who's dying to see me.
{113525}{113590}Meg.
{114280}{114355}Meg.
{114471}{114568}Meg, no.
{115002}{115089}Oh, I'm sorry, kid.
{115116}{115210}There's some things|you just can't change.
{115251}{115335}Yes, I can.
{115388}{115450}We were so close!
{115456}{115522}So close. We tripped|at the finish line. Why?
{115528}{115670}Because our little nut, Meg,|has to go all noble.
{115724}{115783}- Where's Meg?|- Oh. Look who's here.
{115789}{115895}- Wonderboy, you are too much.|- Let her go.
{115901}{116006}Get a grip. Come here. Come here.|Let me show you around.
{116012}{116119}Hmph. Well, well.|It's a small underworld, after all, huh?
{116125}{116213}- Meg!|- No, no, no. Mustn't touch.
{116219}{116281}You see, Meg's running|with a new crowd these days...
{116287}{116367}and not a very lively one at that.
{116373}{116450}You like making deals.|Take me in Meg's place.
{116456}{116582}Oh, hmph. The son of my hated rival|trapped forever in a river of death.
{116588}{116642}- Going once!|- Hmm? Is there a downside to this?
{116648}{116717}- Going twice!|- Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay!
{116723}{116843}You get her out.|She goes; you stay.
{116880}{116959}Oh, you know what slipped my mind?|You'll be dead before|you can get to her.
{116965}{117076}That's not a problem, is it?
{117635}{117685}Oh!
{117691}{117741}What's the matter|with these scissors?
{117747}{117844}The thread won't cut.
{117992}{118050}This is...|This is impossible!
{118056}{118122}You... You... You can't be alive.|You'd have to be a, a...
{118128}{118229}A god?
{118274}{118362}Hercules, stop!|Ya can't do this to me! Ya can't...
{118368}{118442}Fine. Okay. Listen.|Okay, well, I deserved that.
{118448}{118538}Herc, Herc, Herc? Can we talk?|Y-Your dad? He's a fun guy, right?
{118544}{118592}So maybe you could|put in a word with him...
{118598}{118646}and he'd kind of blow|this whole thing off, you know?
{118652}{118764}Meg, Meg, talk to him.|You know, a little schmooze, uh...
{118796}{118920}Get away from me! Don't touch me!|Get your slimy souls off me!
