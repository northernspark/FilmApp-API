We're answerable to God.
I'm not giving it back.

It's not yours. It's not mine.
I don't use that.

Who has drugs
but doesn't use them?

802
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:36,799
- I'm holding it. I'm a safe house.
- We gave you a safe house.

803
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:40,773
Come on.
Don't look at me like that.

804
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:43,305

- Get right with God, Wendy.
- Shit.

It's not for me!

811

What? Peace, righteousness?
Eternal life?

Which one is not for you?

813
