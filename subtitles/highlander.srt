Their opponents,
in the corner to my right...

23

with a combined weight of 745 pounds...

00:02:22,649 --> 00:02:25,985
the toasts of the coasts...

00:02:26,027 --> 00:02:29,072
from Brad Street, U.S.A.,

Yeah!

You gotta love it!

00:04:06,002 --> 00:04:08,046
Kill him!
Stomp on the son of--

00:04:30,443 --> 00:04:32,612
Hey! Where you going?

31
00:05:38,177 --> 00:05:39,220
Macleod.

32
00:05:44,684 --> 00:05:47,645
Fasil. Wait.

33
00:06:04,662 --> 00:06:05,705
Aah!

34
00:06:08,124 --> 00:06:09,709
All right.

35
00:06:20,094 --> 00:06:21,179
Aah!

36
00:06:46,287 --> 00:06:47,497
Aah!

37
00:06:58,549 --> 00:06:59,926
Ah ha ha!

38
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:13,064
Aah!

39
00:07:40,591 --> 00:07:41,634
Aah!

40
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:32,852
Ahh.

41
00:08:32,935 --> 00:08:34,103
Ow.

42
00:09:02,715 --> 00:09:04,175
Aah!

43
00:09:35,748 --> 00:09:37,708
- Oh!

44
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:38,876
Oh!

45
00:09:41,045 --> 00:09:42,213
Oh!

46
00:09:56,894 --> 00:09:59,188
Aah!

47
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,334
Aah!

48
00:10:20,418 --> 00:10:22,378
Ohh...

49
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:17,100
Macleod!

50
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,104
Clan Macleod!

51
00:11:31,656 --> 00:11:35,576
May this year
of our Lord 1536...

52
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,122
bring victory
to the Clan Macleod!

53
00:11:39,205 --> 00:11:40,581
Macleod!

54
00:11:40,665 --> 00:11:43,751
Victory to Macleod!

55
00:11:49,966 --> 00:11:52,719
Hurry up! Hurry up!

56
00:11:55,596 --> 00:11:58,015
Are you scared, Connor?

57
00:11:58,099 --> 00:11:59,600
Ha ha ha!

58
00:11:59,684 --> 00:12:02,312
No, Cousin Dugal.
I'm not!

59
00:12:02,395 --> 00:12:04,272
Don't talk nonsense, man.

60
00:12:04,355 --> 00:12:08,526
I peed my kilt the first time
I went into battle.

61
00:12:08,609 --> 00:12:09,902
Oh, aye.

62
00:12:09,986 --> 00:12:12,280
Angus pees his kilt
all the time!

63
00:12:34,802 --> 00:12:36,012
Connor!

64
00:12:36,888 --> 00:12:38,389
Connor, wait!

65
00:12:38,431 --> 00:12:40,558
Wait!

66
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,020
Take these flowers
and think of me.

67
00:12:45,938 --> 00:12:49,650
Remember, you fight with God
on your side, Connor.

68
00:12:49,734 --> 00:12:51,861
A girl like that
can wound a soldier...

69
00:12:51,944 --> 00:12:53,905
more than a Frazer sword,
my friend.

70
00:12:53,988 --> 00:12:56,699
Angus! You and Dugal
keep him in one piece!

71
00:12:56,783 --> 00:12:59,494
Aye, we all know
what piece that is!

72
00:13:42,662 --> 00:13:46,290
There is one called Connor
among them.

73
00:13:46,374 --> 00:13:47,708
Aye.

74
00:13:53,297 --> 00:13:55,299
Remember our
agreement, Murdoch.

75
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,178
The boy is mine.

76
00:13:59,262 --> 00:14:01,180
It's begun.

77
00:14:01,264 --> 00:14:04,225
Death to the Macleods!

78
00:14:04,309 --> 00:14:07,228
Death to the Macleods!

79
00:14:07,311 --> 00:14:10,356
Yay! Yay!

80
00:14:15,987 --> 00:14:17,864
Death to the Frazers!

81
00:14:17,905 --> 00:14:19,991
Yay! Yah!

82
00:14:33,671 --> 00:14:34,922
Unh!

83
00:14:39,886 --> 00:14:41,679
Macleod!

84
00:14:45,933 --> 00:14:47,602
Aah!

85
00:14:57,361 --> 00:14:58,738
Come on!

86
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,615
Macleod!

87
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:06,663
Now you stay under.

88
00:15:08,206 --> 00:15:11,709
- Forgive me... my son.
- Aah!

89
00:15:13,211 --> 00:15:15,213
Fight me, damn you!

90
00:15:15,296 --> 00:15:16,881
Fight me, cowards!

91
00:15:16,964 --> 00:15:18,549
No, not him!

92
00:15:26,641 --> 00:15:28,226
Castrate the heathens!

93
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:30,478
Nobody will fight me!

94
00:15:30,561 --> 00:15:33,064
They all run away.

95
00:15:33,147 --> 00:15:36,567
Here, laddie, stay by me.

96
00:15:42,615 --> 00:15:44,742
Mother of God.

97
00:15:49,789 --> 00:15:51,249
Fight me!

98
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,500
Unnhhrr!

99
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,168
Ooh!

100
00:15:58,005 --> 00:16:00,758
Aah!

101
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,218
Unh!

102
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:06,889
No!

103
00:16:06,973 --> 00:16:09,225
Come on, quick!

104
00:16:09,308 --> 00:16:11,144
There can be only one!

105
00:16:11,185 --> 00:16:13,271
Unh!

106
00:16:14,272 --> 00:16:16,274
Another time, Macleod!

107
00:16:50,433 --> 00:16:52,810
Get out of the car!

108
00:16:52,852 --> 00:16:56,314
Put your hands
on the hood!

109
00:16:56,397 --> 00:16:58,399
Move!

110
00:16:58,483 --> 00:17:00,651
Okay!

111
00:17:02,111 --> 00:17:04,072
Watch it, freak!
Just cool it!

112
00:17:04,155 --> 00:17:05,656
Watch him!
Watch him!

113
00:17:05,698 --> 00:17:09,202
Move! Come on!
Come on! Move!

114
00:17:09,285 --> 00:17:11,329
Come on!
Get up there!

115
00:17:11,371 --> 00:17:13,039
Aah!

116
00:17:13,081 --> 00:17:14,540
Spread 'em!
Spread 'em!

117
00:17:14,624 --> 00:17:16,834
- Come on!

118
00:17:16,918 --> 00:17:19,712
Let's see
some l.D., pal.

119
00:17:21,255 --> 00:17:22,965
Well, Mr. Nash.

120
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:27,303
Where were you going
in such a hurry?

121
00:17:27,386 --> 00:17:31,265
Give me it!
Give me it!

122
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:32,392
Ooh!

123
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:40,149
Don't move, pal.

124
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:42,318
Don't even breathe!

125
00:18:22,775 --> 00:18:26,821
In nomine patri et filii
et spiritu sancti.

126
00:18:26,904 --> 00:18:28,281
Amen.

127
00:18:30,199 --> 00:18:32,160
It is over.

128
00:18:32,201 --> 00:18:33,661
No!

129
00:18:33,744 --> 00:18:36,289
Other men are
dying this day.

130
00:18:36,372 --> 00:18:38,416
I must attend them.

131
00:18:39,709 --> 00:18:41,044
Quiet!

132
00:18:45,173 --> 00:18:47,634
He's a highlander, by God!

133
00:18:47,675 --> 00:18:50,136
The last sound he hears...

134
00:18:50,178 --> 00:18:53,848
shouldn't be that
of a wailing woman!

135
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:20,375
Hey, let me through.

136
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:24,295
Damn it, Frank.
Forensics is supposed to be notified...

137
00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:26,547
the same time as homicide.

138
00:19:26,631 --> 00:19:28,091
Holy shit.

139
00:19:28,174 --> 00:19:30,009
Yeah, this one came unassembled.

140
00:19:30,051 --> 00:19:31,594
Did you make an arrest?

141
00:19:31,678 --> 00:19:34,806
No. We're questioning
some guy named Nash.

142
00:19:34,889 --> 00:19:37,141
Antique dealer on Hudson Street.

143
00:19:37,183 --> 00:19:39,811
- Hello, Brenda.
- Hey, Walt.

144
00:19:39,852 --> 00:19:42,146
You look pretty, Brenda.

145
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,648
What do you think's...

146
00:19:43,689 --> 00:19:45,525
the cause of death,
Lieutenant, huh?

147
00:19:45,566 --> 00:19:48,945
You're a barrel
of laughs, Garfield.

148
00:19:49,028 --> 00:19:50,988
Get your hands off!

149
00:19:51,072 --> 00:19:54,033
Try explaining this to my wife!

150
00:19:54,075 --> 00:19:57,370
Get me a cherry-cheese danish too.

151
00:19:57,411 --> 00:19:59,539
What time did he buy it?

152
00:19:59,622 --> 00:20:01,124
About 10:00, 10:30.

153
00:20:01,207 --> 00:20:03,835
Whatever cut him
was razor sharp.

154
00:20:03,918 --> 00:20:07,839
Get out of here
with these cameras!

155
00:20:07,922 --> 00:20:09,882
Frank! Frank!

156
00:20:09,924 --> 00:20:12,010
Oh, my God.

157
00:20:12,051 --> 00:20:15,888
A guy was killed
like this in Jersey.

158
00:20:15,972 --> 00:20:18,725
What the hell.
That's Jersey.

159
00:20:18,808 --> 00:20:20,351
I want out!

160
00:20:20,435 --> 00:20:22,687
Hey, Frank. Come here.

161
00:20:23,729 --> 00:20:26,065
Aw, shit!

162
00:20:27,317 --> 00:20:31,237
Ooh, baby.
Look at you.

163
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:34,365
Garfield, cover that head.

164
00:20:36,284 --> 00:20:38,744
Oh...

165
00:20:38,786 --> 00:20:41,748
What the hell
have you got?

166
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:44,041
A Toledo-Salamanca.

167
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,460
A what?

168
00:20:45,543 --> 00:20:48,212
A sword, Frank.
A very rare sword.

169
00:20:48,296 --> 00:20:50,256
Is it worth much?

170
00:20:50,339 --> 00:20:52,759
Only about a million bucks.

171
00:20:54,343 --> 00:20:56,763
Any antique dealer
on Hudson Street...

172
00:20:56,846 --> 00:20:58,264
could tell you that.

173
00:21:00,808 --> 00:21:03,770
You can't keep me here!

174
00:21:03,811 --> 00:21:05,938
I know my rights!

175
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:38,471
Ever see this guy before, Nash?

176
00:21:38,513 --> 00:21:40,723
His name's Vazilek,
Polish national.

177
00:21:40,807 --> 00:21:44,143
Had his head chopped off
in New Jersey two nights ago.

178
00:21:44,227 --> 00:21:46,729
You ever get over
to New Jersey, Nash?

179
00:21:46,813 --> 00:21:48,898
Not if I can help it.

180
00:21:48,981 --> 00:21:50,858
You talk funny.
Where you from?

181
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:52,902
Lots of different places.

182
00:21:52,985 --> 00:21:56,364
- You're an antique dealer, right?
- Mm-hmm.

183
00:21:56,447 --> 00:21:59,033
Okay. What's that?

184
00:22:03,162 --> 00:22:04,747
A sword?

185
00:22:04,831 --> 00:22:06,874
Wise up, smart ass.

186
00:22:08,292 --> 00:22:12,588
It's a Toledo-Salamanca broadsword
worth about a million bucks.

187
00:22:12,672 --> 00:22:14,006
So?

188
00:22:14,048 --> 00:22:15,925
So you want to hear a theory?

189
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:19,720
You went down that garage
to buy this sword from that guy--

190
00:22:19,804 --> 00:22:22,306
- What's his name?
- I don't know. You tell me.

191
00:22:22,348 --> 00:22:24,267
Okay, his name's
lman Fasil.

192
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:27,311
You fought about the price
and cut off his head.

193
00:22:27,395 --> 00:22:29,772
Want to hear another theory?

194
00:22:29,856 --> 00:22:32,317
This Fasil was so upset...

195
00:22:32,358 --> 00:22:34,944
about the lousy
wrestling tonight...

196
00:22:35,028 --> 00:22:41,159
in a fit of depression,
he cut off his own head.

197
00:22:41,242 --> 00:22:43,077
That's not funny, Walt.

198
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:45,121
Are you a faggot, Nash?

199
00:22:45,204 --> 00:22:47,999
Why? You cruising
for a piece of ass?

200
00:22:49,834 --> 00:22:51,711
I'll tell you
what happened, Russell.

201
00:22:51,794 --> 00:22:54,714
You went down to the garage
for a blow job.

202
00:22:54,797 --> 00:22:57,050
You just didn't
want to pay for it.

203
00:22:57,133 --> 00:22:59,927
Huh. You are sick.

204
00:23:00,928 --> 00:23:02,263
Hey! Hey!

205
00:23:02,346 --> 00:23:04,849
Hey, what are you doing?

206
00:23:04,932 --> 00:23:06,100
Stop!

207
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:08,645
- What, are you crazy?
- Break it up, goddamn it!

208
00:23:08,728 --> 00:23:12,148
That's enough!
Now, cut it out!

209
00:23:12,231 --> 00:23:14,859
Goddamn it,
I said cut it out!

210
00:23:16,069 --> 00:23:18,988
- Am I under arrest?
- Not yet.

211
00:23:19,072 --> 00:23:21,032
Then we're through.

212
00:23:21,074 --> 00:23:23,409
Nash, we're just
getting started.

213
00:23:26,704 --> 00:23:29,040
...in water from the sprinkler.

214
00:23:29,082 --> 00:23:32,001
It also left a man's
decapitated body...

215
00:23:32,085 --> 00:23:35,463
next to his own severed head.

216
00:23:35,546 --> 00:23:39,008
A head which at this time
has no name.

217
00:23:39,092 --> 00:23:41,177
I know his name.

218
00:23:43,471 --> 00:23:46,182
* Here I am *

219
00:23:46,265 --> 00:23:50,186
* I'm the master
of your destiny *

220
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,939
Ahh!

221
00:23:54,315 --> 00:23:57,360
* I am the one
The only one *

222
00:23:57,443 --> 00:24:00,321
* I am the god
of kingdom come *

223
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:02,698
* Give me the prize *

224
00:24:02,782 --> 00:24:05,201
* Just give me the prize **

225
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:17,547
Okay, Mr. Victor Kruger.

226
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,173
Room 315.

227
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:23,052
And I'll hit you
for 20 in advance.

228
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:29,475
Uh, hey, uh.

229
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:31,978
If there's anything
you need--

230
00:24:32,061 --> 00:24:35,732
Broads, uh, blow.
Just dial 0, huh?

231
00:24:35,815 --> 00:24:38,109
That's right, Mr. Kruger.

232
00:24:38,192 --> 00:24:40,945
Lucky Strike means
fine tobacco.

233
00:24:41,028 --> 00:24:43,322
Don't talk to the guests.

234
00:24:43,406 --> 00:24:45,032
I didn't do nothing.

235
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:39,003
At last...

236
00:25:39,087 --> 00:25:40,880
the gathering.

237
00:25:45,051 --> 00:25:46,386
Hi.

238
00:25:46,427 --> 00:25:47,845
I'm Candy.

239
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:53,559
Of course you are.

240
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,530
Come on in.

241
00:26:05,571 --> 00:26:09,033
Hiya. Got a present
from the coroner.

242
00:26:09,075 --> 00:26:14,038
Pieces of metal found
on the dead guy under the Garden.

243
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,874
In the wound
and on the clothes.

244
00:26:16,916 --> 00:26:18,835
Real smooth shave.

245
00:26:35,143 --> 00:26:38,062
That can't be right.

246
00:26:43,276 --> 00:26:45,069
Son of a bitch.

247
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:45,380
Who's there?

248
00:28:02,522 --> 00:28:05,024
Hey, Brenda. Usual?

249
00:28:05,108 --> 00:28:06,526
Lots of it.

250
00:28:06,609 --> 00:28:08,027
Oh.

251
00:28:08,111 --> 00:28:12,532
* ls better than
a lifetime alone *

252
00:28:12,615 --> 00:28:14,200
Say when.

253
00:28:15,576 --> 00:28:18,037
* One sentimental moment
in your arms *

254
00:28:18,121 --> 00:28:19,205
When.

255
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,250
* ls like a shooting star... *

256
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,961
Excuse me a minute, Brenda.

257
00:28:25,044 --> 00:28:27,463
Double Glenmoran on the rocks.

258
00:28:27,547 --> 00:28:28,881
Glenmoran. Right.

259
00:28:28,965 --> 00:28:31,426
Go to the Garden often?

260
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:34,053
What did you say?

261
00:28:34,137 --> 00:28:35,722
Hmm?

262
00:28:35,805 --> 00:28:40,309
* I'm a prisoner of love
inside you *

263
00:28:40,393 --> 00:28:45,022
* I'm falling apart all around you *

264
00:28:45,106 --> 00:28:47,191
What did you say?

265
00:28:48,651 --> 00:28:51,696
Madison...Square...Garden.

266
00:28:53,156 --> 00:28:55,575
Do you go there often?

267
00:28:55,658 --> 00:28:56,701
Why?

268
00:28:58,077 --> 00:28:59,579
Basketball?

269
00:28:59,662 --> 00:29:01,706
The circus? Wrestling?

270
00:29:01,789 --> 00:29:05,043
Why are you asking me?

271
00:29:05,126 --> 00:29:07,086
Have you been following me?

272
00:29:07,128 --> 00:29:11,215
I'd like to walk
you home, Brenda.

273
00:29:13,217 --> 00:29:14,719
Uh...

274
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:20,433
I can take care of myself.

275
00:29:20,516 --> 00:29:27,190
* It's always a rainy day without you *

276
00:29:27,273 --> 00:29:32,403
* I'm a prisoner of love
inside you *

277
00:29:32,445 --> 00:29:35,448
* I'm falling apart *

278
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:39,452
* All around you **

279
00:30:32,171 --> 00:30:33,131
Huh!

280
00:30:33,172 --> 00:30:34,257
Aah!

281
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,675
Be quiet!

282
00:30:35,717 --> 00:30:36,884
Unnhhrr!

283
00:30:40,179 --> 00:30:41,764
Aah!

284
00:30:52,191 --> 00:30:54,152
Here. Take this.

285
00:31:16,048 --> 00:31:18,635
Ha ha ha!

286
00:31:19,802 --> 00:31:20,720
Aah!

287
00:31:20,803 --> 00:31:23,097
Oh!

288
00:31:24,557 --> 00:31:27,602
Nice to see you
again, Macleod.

289
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:29,437
Nice to see you--

290
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,522
Ooh!

291
00:31:31,606 --> 00:31:33,608
- Ooh!
- Stop!

292
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:35,443
There can be only one!

293
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,948
No!

294
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:42,200
Unh!

295
00:31:42,283 --> 00:31:43,493
Unnhhrr!

296
00:31:44,577 --> 00:31:45,912
You, on the ground.

297
00:31:45,995 --> 00:31:47,663
This is the police.

298
00:31:47,747 --> 00:31:50,041
Put down your weapons.

299
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:51,959
Hands on your head.

300
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,962
Another time, Highlander!
I will find you!

301
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:58,091
Hold it right there!

302
00:31:58,174 --> 00:31:59,926
Come back here!

303
00:32:03,513 --> 00:32:04,430
Stop!

304
00:32:04,514 --> 00:32:05,932
Wait!

305
00:32:06,015 --> 00:32:07,433
Who was that?

306
00:32:07,517 --> 00:32:08,935
He called you Highlander.

307
00:32:09,018 --> 00:32:10,978
"There can be only one"?

308
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:12,438
Only one what?

309
00:32:12,522 --> 00:32:15,483
- I want to know!
- Shut up!

310
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:18,444
Don't you ever
follow me again.

311
00:32:18,528 --> 00:32:20,988
You only have one life.

312
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:24,117
If you value it...
go home.

313
00:32:29,997 --> 00:32:32,583
Ha ha!

314
00:32:36,003 --> 00:32:37,964
You saw the wound.

315
00:32:38,005 --> 00:32:39,924
He should have died.

316
00:32:39,966 --> 00:32:42,969
I say he's got
the devil in him.

317
00:33:03,489 --> 00:33:06,451
Drinking with us, are you?

318
00:33:06,534 --> 00:33:08,119
What's the matter, Dugal?

319
00:33:08,161 --> 00:33:09,787
You, talking
and breathing...

320
00:33:09,829 --> 00:33:13,041
and last night,
all but a corpse.

321
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:14,792
How did you manage that?

322
00:33:14,834 --> 00:33:17,086
You'd rather I was dead?

323
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:19,088
It's not natural.

324
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:24,093
He's in league with Lucifer.

325
00:33:24,177 --> 00:33:27,221
Don't say that, Kate.

326
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:29,140
I'll say it.

327
00:33:29,182 --> 00:33:31,392
You've the devil in you.

328
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:34,562
We've been kinsmen 20 years.

329
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:37,148
Connor Macleod was my kinsman.

330
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:40,526
I don't know who you are.

331
00:33:46,199 --> 00:33:47,283
Angus.

332
00:33:47,366 --> 00:33:49,285
You better go, Connor.

333
00:33:52,038 --> 00:33:54,248
I'm not going anywhere.

334
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:56,501
He's the devil!
Kill him!

335
00:33:56,584 --> 00:33:57,668
Lucifer!

336
00:34:04,967 --> 00:34:06,636
Burn the devil out of him!

337
00:34:15,561 --> 00:34:18,356
All right.
Get him down.

338
00:34:18,439 --> 00:34:19,607
Burn him!

339
00:34:20,566 --> 00:34:22,610
Leave him be!

340
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:23,945
Dugal...

341
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:25,905
Oh!

342
00:34:25,947 --> 00:34:29,075
He's your cousin, man!

343
00:34:37,792 --> 00:34:39,377
No, Angus!

344
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,461
Quiet!

345
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:42,046
Quiet!

346
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:45,258
There'll be no burning
here today!

347
00:34:45,341 --> 00:34:46,884
We'll banish him!

348
00:34:46,926 --> 00:34:49,679
No! Burn him!

349
00:34:49,762 --> 00:34:51,139
Stop it, Kate!

350
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:52,682
Burn him!

351
00:34:53,933 --> 00:34:56,269
Angus, burn him!

352
00:34:56,311 --> 00:34:57,478
Can you walk?

353
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:59,564
I'll bloody well
walk out of here.

354
00:34:59,605 --> 00:35:02,400
Then go!
While there's still time.

355
00:35:03,735 --> 00:35:06,487
I'll not forget you, Angus.

356
00:37:14,991 --> 00:37:17,535
That's a good dog.

357
00:37:25,126 --> 00:37:28,755
Pie and ale.
Do you want it?

358
00:37:28,838 --> 00:37:31,299
Aye. Right now.

359
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:34,802
You filthy sod!
You're all muck and muscle.

360
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:38,639
Aye, blossom.
The way you like it.

361
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:40,016
Ha ha ha!

362
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:42,352
Ha ha!

363
00:37:42,435 --> 00:37:43,311
Ahh!

364
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:44,645
Waah!

365
00:37:59,494 --> 00:38:03,081
You can do that to me
forever, my lord.

366
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:07,877
Will you, Connor?

367
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,588
Aye, blossom. I will.

368
00:38:17,345 --> 00:38:19,097
Whoa!

369
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:25,728
Greetings.

370
00:38:25,812 --> 00:38:29,357
I am Juan Sanchez
Villa-Lobos Ramirez...

371
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,611
chief metallurgist
to King Charles V of Spain...

372
00:38:33,695 --> 00:38:36,072
and I'm at your service.

373
00:38:36,155 --> 00:38:37,615
Who?

374
00:38:41,536 --> 00:38:43,788
What do you want?

375
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,498
You.

376
00:38:48,501 --> 00:38:49,961
You're Connor Macleod.

377
00:38:50,002 --> 00:38:51,671
Maybe I am and--

378
00:38:51,754 --> 00:38:54,924
You're Connor Macleod,
wounded in battle...

379
00:38:55,008 --> 00:38:58,970
and driven from your village
five years ago.

380
00:38:59,053 --> 00:39:00,721
- Connor!
- Ohh!

381
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:04,225
Heather, go in the house.

382
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:05,768
I'll stay right here.

383
00:39:05,852 --> 00:39:07,895
Do as I say, woman!

384
00:39:16,863 --> 00:39:19,824
Aaah!

385
00:39:19,866 --> 00:39:20,783
Aah!

386
00:39:20,867 --> 00:39:22,285
Aaah!

387
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:27,290
The sensation you're feeling
is the quickening.

388
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,459
Who are you?

389
00:39:30,543 --> 00:39:33,087
We are the same, Macleod!

390
00:39:33,171 --> 00:39:36,674
We are brothers!

391
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,058
I knew you guys
were bottle-fed.

392
00:39:46,142 --> 00:39:51,564
Well, there's not a lot
I can do about it, pal.

393
00:39:51,647 --> 00:39:54,067
See what I'm up against?

394
00:39:54,108 --> 00:39:57,445
His Vietnamese neighbor
ate his dog.

395
00:39:57,528 --> 00:39:59,906
Uh...
that's confidential.

396
00:39:59,989 --> 00:40:01,824
How are things
in forensics?

397
00:40:01,907 --> 00:40:04,243
Dull. How about lunch?

398
00:40:04,327 --> 00:40:07,246
Lunch? It's a good idea.
Who pays?

399
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:08,456
Me.

400
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:09,958
You're on.

401
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:11,959
By the way, Frank...

402
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:14,420
the hairs in the Moretti case...

403
00:40:14,504 --> 00:40:15,964
matched up.

404
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:18,049
Oh, I forgot my purse.

405
00:40:18,091 --> 00:40:21,010
I'll meet you outside.

406
00:40:21,093 --> 00:40:24,180
Garfield, Brenda and I
are going to lunch.

407
00:41:08,516 --> 00:41:10,476
Sometimes, Macleod...

408
00:41:10,518 --> 00:41:13,604
the sharpest blade is not enough.

409
00:41:16,983 --> 00:41:25,199
* B-A-L-A-N-C-E
Balance **

410
00:41:25,283 --> 00:41:27,285
I don't like boats!
I don't like water!

411
00:41:27,326 --> 00:41:30,246
I'm a man, not a fish.

412
00:41:30,329 --> 00:41:32,373
Oh, you complain endlessly.

413
00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:36,210
You look like a woman,
you stupid haggis.

414
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:37,795
Haggis? What is haggis?

415
00:41:37,879 --> 00:41:40,048
Sheep's stomach stuffed
with meat and barley.

416
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:42,759
And what do you
do with it?

417
00:41:42,842 --> 00:41:44,510
You eat it.

418
00:41:44,594 --> 00:41:46,888
How revolting.

419
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:47,972
Ah-choo!

420
00:41:48,055 --> 00:41:50,683
Be still.
You'll tip us over!

421
00:41:50,767 --> 00:41:51,726
So?

422
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:54,520
I cannot swim,
you Spanish peacock.

423
00:41:54,604 --> 00:41:56,022
I'm not Spanish.
I'm Egyptian.

424
00:41:56,105 --> 00:41:59,108
You said you were
from Spain! Liar!

425
00:41:59,192 --> 00:42:02,570
You have the manners
of a goat...

426
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:06,032
and you smell like dung.

427
00:42:06,115 --> 00:42:09,410
And you have no knowledge
whatsoever of your potential.

428
00:42:09,494 --> 00:42:11,329
Now, get out!

429
00:42:11,371 --> 00:42:12,538
No!

430
00:42:13,623 --> 00:42:15,041
Help!

431
00:42:15,124 --> 00:42:17,627
Help! Help!

432
00:42:19,629 --> 00:42:21,631
Help!

433
00:42:21,714 --> 00:42:23,591
Help me, I'm drowning!

434
00:42:23,675 --> 00:42:26,552
You can't drown, you fool.
You're immortal!

435
00:42:29,389 --> 00:42:32,016
I'm drowning!
Come help!

436
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:38,314
* We ask you...
Heavenly Father **

437
00:42:40,608 --> 00:42:42,276
I'm alive.

438
00:42:47,448 --> 00:42:48,908
I can breathe.

439
00:42:58,209 --> 00:42:59,544
Ha ha ha!

440
00:42:59,585 --> 00:43:01,963
Ha ha ha ha!

441
00:43:07,927 --> 00:43:10,513
I'll slice you in half.

442
00:43:34,579 --> 00:43:35,580
Hah!

443
00:43:36,789 --> 00:43:38,458
Crude and slow, clansman.

444
00:43:38,541 --> 00:43:42,503
Your attack was no better
than that of a clumsy child.

445
00:43:42,587 --> 00:43:44,672
Hah!

446
00:43:50,219 --> 00:43:54,807
This cannot be.
It's the devil's work.

447
00:43:57,602 --> 00:44:01,939
You cannot die, Macleod.
Accept it.

448
00:44:02,023 --> 00:44:03,483
Ha ha ha!

449
00:44:03,566 --> 00:44:05,276
Ha ha ha!

450
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:08,321
I hate you.

451
00:44:08,404 --> 00:44:09,322
Good.

452
00:44:09,405 --> 00:44:11,532
That is a perfect
way to start.

453
00:44:13,492 --> 00:44:14,452
Tell me...

454
00:44:14,493 --> 00:44:16,662
how did it happen,
for God's sake?

455
00:44:19,666 --> 00:44:23,127
Why does the sun
come up, hmm?

456
00:44:23,211 --> 00:44:27,257
Or are the stars just pinholes
in the curtain of night?

457
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:29,217
Who knows?

458
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,052
What I do know is...

459
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:32,929
because you were
born different...

460
00:44:33,012 --> 00:44:37,475
men will fear you,
try to drive you away...

461
00:44:37,517 --> 00:44:39,811
Iike the people
of your village.

462
00:44:50,655 --> 00:44:54,617
You must learn to conceal
your special gift...

463
00:44:54,659 --> 00:44:56,577
and harness your power...

464
00:44:56,661 --> 00:44:59,747
until the time
of the gathering.

465
00:45:02,667 --> 00:45:04,168
What gathering?

466
00:45:04,335 --> 00:45:07,046
When only a few of us
are left...

467
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:08,881
we will feel
an irresistible pull...

468
00:45:08,965 --> 00:45:12,260
towards a faraway land...

469
00:45:12,343 --> 00:45:14,345
to fight for the prize.

470
00:45:17,724 --> 00:45:19,141
Come on!

471
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:21,769
Faster!

472
00:45:29,694 --> 00:45:31,112
Unh!

473
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:33,197
Never lose your temper.

474
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:36,617
If your head comes away
from your neck...

475
00:45:36,701 --> 00:45:38,161
it's over.

476
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:46,085
Ha ha ha!

477
00:46:02,143 --> 00:46:03,144
Unnh!

478
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:06,147
Never overextend
your thrust.

479
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:08,608
You're vulnerable and...

480
00:46:08,691 --> 00:46:10,526
off balance.

481
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:12,737
Connor! Ha ha ha!

482
00:46:14,322 --> 00:46:16,199
Heather, please.

483
00:46:28,336 --> 00:46:34,008
If it came down to us two,
would you take my head?

484
00:46:34,092 --> 00:46:35,468
Ha!

485
00:46:37,762 --> 00:46:40,640
We must fight
until only one remains.

486
00:46:40,682 --> 00:46:44,102
You are safe only on holy ground.

487
00:46:44,143 --> 00:46:47,772
None of us will violate that law.

488
00:46:47,855 --> 00:46:49,398
It's tradition.

489
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:04,288
Now for the last.

490
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:06,958
Trust me.

491
00:47:10,545 --> 00:47:13,298
Let yourself
feel the stag.

492
00:47:16,217 --> 00:47:18,177
His heart...

493
00:47:18,219 --> 00:47:19,804
beating.

494
00:47:26,853 --> 00:47:29,939
His blood...coursing.

495
00:47:30,022 --> 00:47:31,983
Feel?

496
00:47:33,192 --> 00:47:34,569
Come on!

497
00:47:34,652 --> 00:47:37,655
I feel him.

498
00:47:37,739 --> 00:47:40,241
Macleod, come on!

499
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:41,784
I feel him!

500
00:47:41,868 --> 00:47:43,619
Come on!

501
00:47:43,703 --> 00:47:46,080
Ha ha ha!

502
00:47:46,164 --> 00:47:48,916
I feel him!

503
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,918
Ha ha ha!

504
00:47:51,002 --> 00:47:53,212
Ha ha ha!

505
00:47:53,296 --> 00:47:55,548
Come on, haggis!

506
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:01,095
Macleod.

507
00:48:01,179 --> 00:48:03,431
This is the quickening.

508
00:48:03,514 --> 00:48:05,433
Yeah!

509
00:48:05,516 --> 00:48:06,767
Yaah!

510
00:48:39,467 --> 00:48:41,010
Now, pendejo...

511
00:48:41,093 --> 00:48:45,097
shall we see what sort of
swordsman you've become?

512
00:48:45,181 --> 00:48:46,933
En garde!

513
00:48:55,108 --> 00:48:56,651
Very good.

514
00:49:15,169 --> 00:49:18,297
Give me your hand, brother.

515
00:49:34,647 --> 00:49:36,566
That one there.

516
00:49:36,649 --> 00:49:38,735
How much is it?

517
00:49:54,876 --> 00:49:56,711
Put him in.

518
00:49:56,794 --> 00:50:00,131
But what I want is a family.

519
00:50:00,173 --> 00:50:02,592
You cannot have a family.

520
00:50:02,675 --> 00:50:05,094
We cannot have children.

521
00:50:05,177 --> 00:50:07,471
That won't please Heather.

522
00:50:07,513 --> 00:50:10,516
I'll tell you that
for nothing.

523
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:13,227
He's full of life.

524
00:50:14,687 --> 00:50:16,272
Connor!

525
00:50:19,191 --> 00:50:20,776
Here's dinner!

526
00:50:22,695 --> 00:50:24,155
I'll be off now.

527
00:50:24,197 --> 00:50:26,782
I fancy buying
a new dress.

528
00:50:30,161 --> 00:50:34,207
Oh, you little devils!
Go on!

529
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,209
She's beautiful.

530
00:50:38,544 --> 00:50:42,090
You must leave her,
brother.

531
00:50:52,684 --> 00:50:55,103
Macleod.

532
00:50:55,186 --> 00:50:58,064
I was born 2,437 years ago.

533
00:50:58,147 --> 00:51:01,567
In that time,
I've had three wives.

534
00:51:01,651 --> 00:51:05,071
The last was Shakiko,
a Japanese princess.

535
00:51:05,154 --> 00:51:08,741
Her father, Masamune, a genius...

536
00:51:08,825 --> 00:51:11,077
made this for me...

537
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,913
in 593 B.C.

538
00:51:15,206 --> 00:51:19,127
It is the only one
of its kind...

539
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:21,129
Iike his daughter.

540
00:51:21,212 --> 00:51:24,465
When Shakiko died,
I was shattered.

541
00:51:24,549 --> 00:51:27,427
I would save you
that pain.

542
00:51:27,468 --> 00:51:30,429
Please.
Let Heather go.

543
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:52,910
When we first met,
you felt ill, remember?

544
00:51:52,994 --> 00:51:55,288
That wasn't the first time...

545
00:51:55,330 --> 00:51:58,249
you felt
that sensation, was it?

546
00:51:58,333 --> 00:51:59,751
No.

547
00:51:59,834 --> 00:52:02,295
When the Macleods
fought the Frazers...

548
00:52:02,336 --> 00:52:04,881
and a black knight...

549
00:52:04,964 --> 00:52:07,133
I felt it then.

550
00:52:07,216 --> 00:52:09,635
Only it was more painful.

551
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:12,138
That black knight
was the Kurgan.

552
00:52:12,221 --> 00:52:15,308
It's because of him
that I sought you out.

553
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,644
Who is the Kurgan?

554
00:52:18,728 --> 00:52:20,646
Where does
he come from?

555
00:52:20,688 --> 00:52:22,815
The Kurgans were
an ancient people...

556
00:52:22,899 --> 00:52:24,525
from the steppes
of Russia.

557
00:52:24,609 --> 00:52:26,319
For amusement,
they tossed children...

558
00:52:26,361 --> 00:52:30,239
into pits with hungry dogs
to fight for meat.

559
00:52:30,323 --> 00:52:31,741
The Kurgan.

560
00:52:31,824 --> 00:52:34,952
He is the strongest
of the immortals.

561
00:52:34,994 --> 00:52:37,371
He is the perfect warrior.

562
00:52:37,455 --> 00:52:39,957
If he wins the prize...

563
00:52:40,041 --> 00:52:44,003
mortal man would suffer
an eternity of darkness.

564
00:52:44,045 --> 00:52:46,506
How do you fight
such a savage?

565
00:52:46,589 --> 00:52:51,260
Hmm. With heart,
faith, and steel.

566
00:52:51,344 --> 00:52:54,972
In the end,
there can be only one.

567
00:52:59,936 --> 00:53:02,271
very dangerous for you.

568
00:53:02,355 --> 00:53:04,816
Well, I was very much in love...

569
00:53:04,857 --> 00:53:06,109
with her, my dear.

570
00:53:06,192 --> 00:53:09,153
She was the only thing
on my mind.

571
00:53:09,195 --> 00:53:11,531
So, holding the rose
in my teeth...

572
00:53:11,614 --> 00:53:15,076
I climbed up on the rooftop,
lowered a rope...

573
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:17,453
and swung in
through the open window.

574
00:53:20,206 --> 00:53:23,334
Unfortunately, the lady
was no longer there.

575
00:53:23,376 --> 00:53:24,794
What did you do?

576
00:53:24,877 --> 00:53:26,295
I introduced myself...

577
00:53:26,379 --> 00:53:28,798
to the lady that was there.

578
00:53:28,881 --> 00:53:30,383
She was most helpful.

579
00:53:32,718 --> 00:53:35,680
Would you like
some more wine?

580
00:53:35,763 --> 00:53:37,849
Yes, please.

581
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:50,069
Heather.

582
00:53:50,111 --> 00:53:51,529
Get out!

583
00:53:51,571 --> 00:53:53,197
What's wrong?

584
00:53:58,578 --> 00:54:00,913
Get out!

585
00:54:00,997 --> 00:54:02,665
Aaah!

586
00:54:02,749 --> 00:54:04,208
Kurgan!

587
00:54:05,626 --> 00:54:07,545
Ramirez!

588
00:54:08,713 --> 00:54:13,176
Raah!

589
00:54:16,929 --> 00:54:20,433
The Highlander,
where is he?

590
00:54:20,516 --> 00:54:21,768
You're too late.

591
00:54:21,851 --> 00:54:23,811
I've prepared him
for you.

592
00:54:23,895 --> 00:54:25,438
You waste your time!

593
00:54:29,775 --> 00:54:31,402
Aah!

594
00:54:38,117 --> 00:54:40,286
Aah!

595
00:54:52,632 --> 00:54:54,968
It hurts?

596
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:00,765
Raaah!

597
00:55:00,807 --> 00:55:02,100
Aaah!

598
00:55:06,646 --> 00:55:10,817
Now you die!
Heh heh heh!

599
00:55:13,486 --> 00:55:17,657
I am the strongest!

600
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:20,701
My cut has improved
your voice.

601
00:55:20,785 --> 00:55:22,662
Rrr!

602
00:55:22,745 --> 00:55:28,918
Whoooa!

603
00:55:50,189 --> 00:55:52,108
Ha ha ha!

604
00:55:52,191 --> 00:55:54,902
Ha ha ha!

605
00:56:07,707 --> 00:56:08,833
Aah!

606
00:56:57,882 --> 00:57:01,552
Ohhhhhh!

607
00:57:01,636 --> 00:57:04,055
Yes!

608
00:57:11,104 --> 00:57:13,022
Yaa!

609
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:21,948
Ha ha ha!

610
00:57:23,115 --> 00:57:24,242
Aah!

611
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:38,089
Ahh. Hurts?

612
00:57:41,676 --> 00:57:43,970
Who is the woman?

613
00:57:45,179 --> 00:57:47,140
Oh! She's mine!

614
00:57:47,223 --> 00:57:48,641
Ahh.

615
00:57:48,725 --> 00:57:51,352
Not for much longer.

616
00:58:00,945 --> 00:58:03,656
Tonight you sleep
in hell!

617
00:58:03,739 --> 00:58:06,451
There can be only one!

618
00:58:42,528 --> 00:58:45,364
Whoooa!

619
00:58:51,329 --> 00:58:53,081
Aaah!

620
00:58:53,164 --> 00:58:56,209
Hello, pretty.

621
00:59:06,636 --> 00:59:08,679
I'd like to speak
to Russell Nash.

622
00:59:08,721 --> 00:59:11,724
Oh, I'm sorry.
Mr. Nash isn't here.

623
00:59:11,808 --> 00:59:14,477
May I call him at home?

624
00:59:14,519 --> 00:59:16,395
That won't be possible.

625
00:59:16,479 --> 00:59:18,481
Good morning.

626
00:59:18,564 --> 00:59:21,484
This is Brenda Wyatt,
Mr. Nash.

627
00:59:22,777 --> 00:59:24,529
We've already met, Rachel.

628
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:27,073
What can I do for you?

629
00:59:27,115 --> 00:59:28,574
I'd like some advice.

630
00:59:28,616 --> 00:59:31,494
Are you someone
who takes advice?

631
00:59:31,577 --> 00:59:33,037
That depends.

632
00:59:33,079 --> 00:59:34,622
Advice about what?

633
00:59:34,705 --> 00:59:37,166
What can you tell me
about a seven-foot lunatic...

634
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:38,876
hacking away with a broadsword...

635
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,504
at one in the morning,
New York City, 1985?

636
00:59:44,048 --> 00:59:45,884
Not much.

637
00:59:45,925 --> 00:59:48,719
A Japanese sword
dated 600 B.C...

638
00:59:48,761 --> 00:59:51,264
the metal folded 200 times?

639
00:59:51,347 --> 00:59:54,100
I don't deal
in exotic weapons.

640
00:59:54,183 --> 00:59:57,812
May I show you something
in 18th-century silver?

641
00:59:57,895 --> 01:00:01,899
That's not why I came.
You know it.

642
01:00:01,941 --> 01:00:03,610
Do you cook?

643
01:00:03,693 --> 01:00:05,027
Why?

644
01:00:05,069 --> 01:00:08,197
I thought
we might have dinner.

645
01:00:08,239 --> 01:00:09,949
Did you?

646
01:00:10,032 --> 01:00:11,159
Yes.

647
01:00:12,535 --> 01:00:16,039
So I'm standing there,
and there's Brenda.

648
01:00:16,122 --> 01:00:18,333
Our little Brenda.

649
01:00:18,416 --> 01:00:21,168
You're sure it was Brenda?

650
01:00:21,252 --> 01:00:25,089
She was in Nash's shop
talking to him.

651
01:00:33,181 --> 01:00:35,099
What are you
looking at, Rachel?

652
01:00:35,183 --> 01:00:37,768
The eyes in the back of your head.

653
01:00:40,187 --> 01:00:42,648
People are asking
about you.

654
01:00:42,690 --> 01:00:44,859
What am I supposed to say?

655
01:00:44,942 --> 01:00:46,611
Hmm?

656
01:00:46,694 --> 01:00:48,488
Tell them I'm immortal.

657
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:24,440
Shh.

658
01:01:25,525 --> 01:01:27,318
Quiet.

659
01:01:32,698 --> 01:01:34,534
Don't be frightened.

660
01:01:34,617 --> 01:01:37,161
- What's your name?
- Rachel.

661
01:01:37,245 --> 01:01:40,873
- What happened?
- Everybody's dead.

662
01:01:42,125 --> 01:01:43,334
Shh.

663
01:01:44,418 --> 01:01:46,504
I'm like you.
I'm alone.

664
01:01:46,587 --> 01:01:48,339
Come with me, Rachel.

665
01:02:02,770 --> 01:02:05,731
You're alive.
Why didn't you die?

666
01:02:05,815 --> 01:02:08,025
Hey. It's a kind of magic.

667
01:02:08,067 --> 01:02:09,152
Shh.

668
01:02:10,987 --> 01:02:12,322
Ow!
Aah!

669
01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:16,492
- Move!
- Nein!

670
01:02:18,244 --> 01:02:20,663
Heh heh heh.
Whatever you say, Jack.

671
01:02:20,746 --> 01:02:22,331
You're the master race.

672
01:02:27,086 --> 01:02:28,337
Let's go.

673
01:02:30,423 --> 01:02:33,176
That was a long time ago.

674
01:02:33,259 --> 01:02:36,929
Would you listen to me
for one moment, please?

675
01:02:36,971 --> 01:02:39,390
You can't hide
your feelings from me.

676
01:02:39,474 --> 01:02:41,726
I've known you too long.

677
01:02:41,768 --> 01:02:43,394
What feelings?

678
01:02:43,436 --> 01:02:45,271
How about loneliness?

679
01:02:45,354 --> 01:02:47,940
I'm not lonely.

680
01:02:48,024 --> 01:02:50,860
I've got everything
I need right here.

681
01:02:50,943 --> 01:02:52,528
Oh, no, you don't.

682
01:02:52,612 --> 01:02:57,867
You refuse to let
anyone love you.

683
01:02:57,909 --> 01:03:00,119
Love is for poets.

684
01:03:03,748 --> 01:03:07,335
You're such
a romantic, Rachel.

685
01:03:07,418 --> 01:03:10,421
You always were.

686
01:03:32,652 --> 01:03:34,070
Just a minute.

687
01:03:53,339 --> 01:03:54,924
Good evening.

688
01:03:59,178 --> 01:04:01,597
You want to dine
in the hall...

689
01:04:01,639 --> 01:04:03,433
or shall we step inside?

690
01:04:03,516 --> 01:04:05,309
Ohh.

691
01:04:05,351 --> 01:04:06,602
Come in.

692
01:04:08,604 --> 01:04:10,022
May I take your coat?

693
01:04:10,106 --> 01:04:11,190
What? No, thanks.

694
01:04:11,274 --> 01:04:13,192
I'll hold on to it.

695
01:04:13,276 --> 01:04:14,861
Oh, fine.

696
01:04:18,322 --> 01:04:19,699
Where are you going?

697
01:04:19,782 --> 01:04:21,993
I forgot my earrings.

698
01:04:22,034 --> 01:04:23,953
Make yourself a drink.

699
01:04:24,036 --> 01:04:27,123
There are glasses in the bar.

700
01:04:30,918 --> 01:04:32,461
Hmm.

701
01:04:38,176 --> 01:04:40,344
You know what you're doing?

702
01:05:01,282 --> 01:05:03,576
I like your place, Brenda.

703
01:05:03,659 --> 01:05:07,997
I've been here three months.
Still fixing it up.

704
01:05:11,834 --> 01:05:13,961
Interesting view.

705
01:05:14,045 --> 01:05:16,047
What did you say?

706
01:05:21,093 --> 01:05:23,763
I said, "lnteresting view"!

707
01:05:23,846 --> 01:05:25,515
Isn't it great?

708
01:05:31,395 --> 01:05:33,314
You never told me...

709
01:05:33,397 --> 01:05:36,359
what you do
for a living.

710
01:05:36,442 --> 01:05:41,197
I work for
the Metropolitan Museum...

711
01:05:41,239 --> 01:05:43,991
in acquisitions.

712
01:05:44,075 --> 01:05:47,161
Huh. That explains
your interest...

713
01:05:47,245 --> 01:05:49,580
in ancient weapons.

714
01:05:51,583 --> 01:05:52,959
Right.

715
01:05:54,543 --> 01:05:57,588
Especially the samurai.

716
01:05:57,630 --> 01:05:59,173
Very nice.

717
01:05:59,257 --> 01:06:01,592
Shall we have a toast?

718
01:06:01,676 --> 01:06:03,177
Yes.

719
01:06:08,182 --> 01:06:10,142
Brandy.

720
01:06:10,226 --> 01:06:12,854
Bottled in 1783.

721
01:06:12,937 --> 01:06:15,147
Wow. That's old.

722
01:06:17,984 --> 01:06:21,279
1783 was a very good year.

723
01:06:22,697 --> 01:06:25,158
Mozart wrote
his great mass.

724
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:27,785
The Montgolfier Brothers went up...

725
01:06:27,868 --> 01:06:30,788
in their first balloon.

726
01:06:32,874 --> 01:06:34,166
Hah.

727
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:36,169
And England recognized...

728
01:06:36,210 --> 01:06:39,672
the independence
of the United States.

729
01:06:39,756 --> 01:06:42,175
Is that right?

730
01:06:42,216 --> 01:06:43,551
Yes.

731
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:52,643
What's that?

732
01:06:52,727 --> 01:06:54,687
It's for you.

733
01:06:54,770 --> 01:06:56,314
Can I open it?

734
01:06:56,397 --> 01:06:58,107
If you like.

735
01:07:12,497 --> 01:07:13,373
You bastard.

736
01:07:13,456 --> 01:07:15,375
Where did you find this?

737
01:07:15,458 --> 01:07:17,543
I have an extensive library.

738
01:07:19,170 --> 01:07:20,421
Odd thing.

739
01:07:20,505 --> 01:07:22,882
Your bio doesn't
mention the Met.

740
01:07:22,965 --> 01:07:25,385
It says you work
for the police...

741
01:07:25,468 --> 01:07:27,220
in forensics.

742
01:07:27,303 --> 01:07:29,388
Are you and Moran
setting me up?

743
01:07:29,472 --> 01:07:31,432
I don't work for Moran.

744
01:07:31,516 --> 01:07:33,893
Then why is that bald policeman...

745
01:07:33,976 --> 01:07:36,395
sitting outside
watching your apartment?

746
01:07:38,189 --> 01:07:39,440
You remember him.

747
01:07:39,524 --> 01:07:40,858
Moran's had him tailing me.

748
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:43,027
What are you going to do?

749
01:07:43,111 --> 01:07:45,780
Question is,
what are you going to do?

750
01:07:45,863 --> 01:07:48,533
Turn off the tape or
shoot me with the .45?

751
01:07:52,161 --> 01:07:54,080
I'm not looking
for a killer.

752
01:07:54,163 --> 01:07:55,581
I'm looking for a sword.

753
01:07:55,665 --> 01:07:57,625
The one used on Fasil.

754
01:07:57,708 --> 01:08:00,503
- I only want to see the samurai.
- Why?

755
01:08:00,586 --> 01:08:02,547
Because it's not
supposed to exist.

756
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:04,757
I dated the blade
at 600 B.C.

757
01:08:04,841 --> 01:08:07,135
The metal had been
folded 200 times.

758
01:08:07,218 --> 01:08:10,680
The Japanese didn't make swords
like that till the Middle Ages.

759
01:08:10,763 --> 01:08:13,057
So where the hell
did it come from?

760
01:08:13,099 --> 01:08:15,059
If I could verify
its existence...

761
01:08:15,101 --> 01:08:17,562
it would be like
discovering a 747...

762
01:08:17,603 --> 01:08:20,606
a thousand years
before the Wright Brothers ever flew.

763
01:08:20,648 --> 01:08:23,109
This is crazy.

764
01:08:23,151 --> 01:08:25,736
Wait a minute, Nash.
I want some answers.

765
01:08:27,613 --> 01:08:29,615
You want?

766
01:08:29,657 --> 01:08:32,076
Don't you ever
think about anything...

767
01:08:32,118 --> 01:08:33,745
except what you want?

768
01:08:48,134 --> 01:08:50,219
You must leave her, brother.

769
01:08:57,769 --> 01:09:02,273
* There's no time for us *

770
01:09:04,984 --> 01:09:09,780
* There's no place for us *

771
01:09:11,073 --> 01:09:18,331
* What is this thing
that fills our dreams *

772
01:09:18,414 --> 01:09:23,169
* Yet slips away from us? *

773
01:09:25,963 --> 01:09:33,096
* Who wants to live forever? *

774
01:09:33,179 --> 01:09:40,103
* Who wants to live forever? *

775
01:09:40,186 --> 01:09:46,108
* Ooh *

776
01:09:46,192 --> 01:09:49,779
* There's no chance for us *

777
01:09:51,948 --> 01:09:58,955
* It's all decided for us *

778
01:09:59,038 --> 01:10:06,671
* This world has
only one sweet moment *

779
01:10:06,712 --> 01:10:10,758
* Set aside for us *

780
01:10:10,925 --> 01:10:12,343
Heather!

781
01:10:13,886 --> 01:10:20,685
* Who wants to live forever? *

782
01:10:20,727 --> 01:10:28,151
* Who wants to live forever? *

783
01:10:28,234 --> 01:10:29,276
* Ooh *

784
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:30,319
Heather!

785
01:10:32,071 --> 01:10:34,866
Connor, I'm here!

786
01:10:37,744 --> 01:10:45,209
* Who dares to love forever *

787
01:10:45,293 --> 01:10:50,548
* Oh-ooh *

788
01:10:50,590 --> 01:10:53,676
* When love must die? **

789
01:10:56,262 --> 01:10:58,723
My beautiful man.

790
01:10:58,765 --> 01:11:00,725
My husband.

791
01:11:00,767 --> 01:11:03,895
I am that, my love.

792
01:11:07,773 --> 01:11:11,152
I've never really known...

793
01:11:11,235 --> 01:11:12,820
What?

794
01:11:14,572 --> 01:11:16,824
Why you stayed.

795
01:11:18,243 --> 01:11:21,662
Because I love you
as much now...

796
01:11:21,746 --> 01:11:24,666
as the first day we met.

797
01:11:24,749 --> 01:11:27,334
And I love you.

798
01:11:31,798 --> 01:11:34,675
I don't want to die.

799
01:11:34,759 --> 01:11:39,180
I want to stay
with you forever.

800
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:41,182
I want that too.

801
01:11:41,266 --> 01:11:44,853
Will you do something
for me, Connor?

802
01:11:47,271 --> 01:11:48,689
What, lass?

803
01:11:48,773 --> 01:11:52,694
In the years to come,
will you light a candle...

804
01:11:52,777 --> 01:11:55,822
and remember me
on my birthday?

805
01:11:55,905 --> 01:12:00,535
Aye, love. I will.

806
01:12:00,618 --> 01:12:04,288
I wanted to have
your children.

807
01:12:04,372 --> 01:12:08,584
They would have been
strong and fine.

808
01:12:12,797 --> 01:12:15,257
Don't see me, Connor.

809
01:12:15,299 --> 01:12:18,052
Let me die in peace.

810
01:12:20,638 --> 01:12:22,932
Where are we?

811
01:12:29,272 --> 01:12:32,233
We're in the highlands.

812
01:12:34,110 --> 01:12:36,237
Where else?

813
01:12:39,115 --> 01:12:41,701
Running down a mountainside.

814
01:12:55,631 --> 01:12:57,884
The sun is shining.

815
01:12:59,176 --> 01:13:00,720
It's not cold.

816
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:05,642
You've got your sheepskins on...

817
01:13:07,811 --> 01:13:11,522
and the boots
I made for you.

818
01:13:15,026 --> 01:13:17,528
Good night,
my bonny Heather.

819
01:13:32,794 --> 01:13:35,379
Hey! Kastagir.

820
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:39,717
Macleod, it's good
to see you again.

821
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:42,720
It seems like 100 years.

822
01:13:42,803 --> 01:13:45,390
It's been 100 years.

823
01:13:53,105 --> 01:13:55,066
How have you been?

824
01:13:56,901 --> 01:13:59,278
Hey, this...

825
01:13:59,362 --> 01:14:03,199
puts hairs on your chest.

826
01:14:05,785 --> 01:14:07,245
What is it?

827
01:14:07,287 --> 01:14:08,621
Boom-boom.

828
01:14:08,705 --> 01:14:10,248
Big strong man like you...

829
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:13,000
shouldn't be afraid
of a little boom-boom.

830
01:14:13,083 --> 01:14:16,129
Maybe you think
I'm trying to poison you.

831
01:14:16,212 --> 01:14:17,964
I think you're crazy, Kastagir.

832
01:14:19,465 --> 01:14:23,428
So...
the gathering is here.

833
01:14:23,511 --> 01:14:25,430
Ahh.

834
01:14:25,471 --> 01:14:27,682
Time's almost
caught us, friend.

835
01:14:27,765 --> 01:14:30,685
Has it? Do you think
we should go on?

836
01:14:32,937 --> 01:14:35,356
I think we should
have a party.

837
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:38,609
Oh, no. I remember
our last party.

838
01:14:38,693 --> 01:14:39,693
Really?

839
01:14:39,777 --> 01:14:41,237
When exactly was that?

840
01:14:41,278 --> 01:14:43,197
It was 1783.

841
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,908
1783.

842
01:14:45,950 --> 01:14:47,368
Oh, yes.

843
01:14:47,451 --> 01:14:49,871
Your famous duel
on Boston Common.

844
01:14:49,954 --> 01:14:51,372
Ha ha ha!
You were drunk.

845
01:14:51,456 --> 01:14:53,875
What was that guy's name again?

846
01:14:53,958 --> 01:14:55,418
His name was Bassett.

847
01:14:55,459 --> 01:14:56,835
The heavier blade, Mr. Bassett.

848
01:14:56,919 --> 01:14:57,878
I implore you.

849
01:14:57,962 --> 01:15:01,507
I am fighting this duel,
Hotchkiss, not you.

850
01:15:01,590 --> 01:15:03,843
See if the imbecile is ready.

851
01:15:03,926 --> 01:15:06,345
Mr. Bassett is waiting, sir.

852
01:15:06,387 --> 01:15:08,264
Tell him I'm ready.

853
01:15:08,347 --> 01:15:11,100
Christ! I've gone blind.

854
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:13,937
En garde, sir.

855
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:16,480
Ohh!

856
01:15:16,522 --> 01:15:19,108
Wonderful, sir.

857
01:15:19,192 --> 01:15:20,985
Thank you, Hotchkiss.

858
01:15:21,068 --> 01:15:22,779
Bassett?

859
01:15:22,820 --> 01:15:25,072
That you?

860
01:15:25,156 --> 01:15:27,283
You missed him, Mr. Bassett.

861
01:15:30,161 --> 01:15:31,579
Unh!

862
01:15:31,663 --> 01:15:32,747
Oh.

863
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:36,167
The sword, the sword.

864
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:38,503
Ha ha ha!

865
01:15:47,762 --> 01:15:49,513
Stop, sir.

866
01:15:49,555 --> 01:15:51,766
I beseech you.

867
01:15:51,849 --> 01:15:54,686
I apologize for
calling your wife...

868
01:15:54,727 --> 01:15:57,188
- a bloated warthog--
- Ha ha ha!

869
01:15:57,230 --> 01:16:00,274
And I bid you good day.

870
01:16:02,193 --> 01:16:03,528
Shoot him, sir.

871
01:16:03,569 --> 01:16:04,487
Shoot him.

872
01:16:04,529 --> 01:16:06,656
Now, sir, in the back!
Now, sir!

873
01:16:06,739 --> 01:16:09,742
Hotchkiss. Hotchkiss!
Stop it!

874
01:16:10,993 --> 01:16:13,079
* Hotchkiss *

875
01:16:13,162 --> 01:16:14,122
What?

876
01:16:14,205 --> 01:16:15,081
No, sir.

877
01:16:15,164 --> 01:16:17,583
No, no...

878
01:16:17,666 --> 01:16:19,627
No! No! No!

879
01:16:23,714 --> 01:16:26,759
That's the mood
of New York now.

880
01:16:26,843 --> 01:16:28,761
Get out of here!

881
01:16:28,845 --> 01:16:30,138
So far...

882
01:16:37,186 --> 01:16:39,605
Earlier today, in response
to growing pressure...

883
01:16:39,647 --> 01:16:42,108
the mayor's office issued
the following statement...

884
01:16:42,191 --> 01:16:43,693
Give us a drink, pal.

885
01:16:43,776 --> 01:16:46,154
Got a joint?

886
01:16:46,237 --> 01:16:47,613
...vigorous investigation...

887
01:16:47,697 --> 01:16:50,616
following up on
some promising leads.

888
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:54,120
Hey, Rockefeller,
how'd you like Candy?

889
01:16:54,203 --> 01:16:57,957
She said you were
kind of kinky, huh?

890
01:16:58,041 --> 01:17:01,252
Don't ever speak to me.

891
01:17:03,212 --> 01:17:05,631
I didn't mean nothin'.

892
01:17:05,715 --> 01:17:07,800
Look, I didn't mean--

893
01:17:10,011 --> 01:17:14,349
Don't ever speak
to me again.

894
01:17:14,432 --> 01:17:16,559
Do you understand?

895
01:17:17,519 --> 01:17:18,603
Yeah.

896
01:17:18,686 --> 01:17:21,147
Good.

897
01:17:23,775 --> 01:17:28,279
I hope you get your head
chopped off, asshole.

898
01:17:30,656 --> 01:17:32,116
And you!

899
01:17:32,158 --> 01:17:33,451
Shut it!

900
01:17:37,205 --> 01:17:39,374
* Here we stand *

901
01:17:39,457 --> 01:17:42,085
* And here we fall *

902
01:17:42,168 --> 01:17:45,087
* History won't care at all *

903
01:17:45,129 --> 01:17:46,756
* Lay on the bed *

904
01:17:46,839 --> 01:17:49,175
* Put out the light *

905
01:17:49,258 --> 01:17:52,887
* ...won't be home tonight, yeah *

906
01:17:52,971 --> 01:17:55,890
* We don't waste no time at all... *

907
01:17:55,974 --> 01:17:58,518
- Hey, big boy.
- Slow down.

908
01:18:00,353 --> 01:18:01,979
* Comes to you... *

909
01:18:02,062 --> 01:18:06,150
* Ahh, we just waited
for another... **

910
01:18:06,233 --> 01:18:07,985
What the hell?

911
01:18:21,749 --> 01:18:24,585
Okay, marine,
this is for real!

912
01:18:28,881 --> 01:18:30,341
Yah!

913
01:18:30,425 --> 01:18:31,467
Let's go!

914
01:18:34,804 --> 01:18:38,141
Go, go, go, go!
Come on, come on!

915
01:18:50,069 --> 01:18:53,239
What the hell
is going on?

916
01:19:06,252 --> 01:19:07,336
Ahh!

917
01:19:20,892 --> 01:19:23,645
Is somebody trapped
in there?

918
01:20:30,336 --> 01:20:33,464
Aah! Aah!

919
01:20:46,811 --> 01:20:47,728
For God's sake!

920
01:20:49,230 --> 01:20:52,775
Ooo!

921
01:21:00,450 --> 01:21:01,826
Look at that!

922
01:21:03,161 --> 01:21:11,002
Uuuuhh!

923
01:21:28,519 --> 01:21:30,020
Rrr!

924
01:21:31,272 --> 01:21:33,858
Ha ha.

925
01:21:33,941 --> 01:21:35,902
Aah! Aah!

926
01:21:39,447 --> 01:21:41,490
Mother of God.

927
01:21:45,995 --> 01:21:47,205
Mom.

928
01:21:47,288 --> 01:21:48,247
Boo!

929
01:21:48,331 --> 01:21:51,667
Aah!

930
01:21:51,709 --> 01:21:55,129
Hey, where are you
going with my car?

931
01:21:55,212 --> 01:21:58,508
Daddy, help me! Daddy!
Daddy, help me!

932
01:21:58,549 --> 01:21:59,467
Help, Daddy!

933
01:21:59,550 --> 01:22:01,218
Daddy, help me!

934
01:22:06,808 --> 01:22:08,685
Frank, take it easy.

935
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:10,728
I checked everywhere.

936
01:22:10,770 --> 01:22:12,730
There aren't any witnesses.

937
01:22:12,771 --> 01:22:15,608
That's New York for you.

938
01:22:15,650 --> 01:22:18,194
Twenty people standing around.
Nobody saw a thing.

939
01:22:18,277 --> 01:22:21,072
Tell me about Matunas.
Is he on drugs?

940
01:22:21,113 --> 01:22:22,532
He's a survival nut.

941
01:22:22,615 --> 01:22:24,075
What?

942
01:22:24,117 --> 01:22:26,077
He was a marine.

943
01:22:26,119 --> 01:22:29,038
His ex-c.o. said
he was paranoid...

944
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:32,041
but he was a good man.

945
01:22:32,125 --> 01:22:34,043
How you doing, kid?

946
01:22:34,126 --> 01:22:36,712
Okay, for a guy who got three feet
of steel crammed through his gut.

947
01:22:36,796 --> 01:22:38,255
How you doing?

948
01:22:38,339 --> 01:22:42,093
I understand
you saw who stuck you?

949
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:43,928
You kidding me, man?

950
01:22:43,969 --> 01:22:45,638
Is that him?

951
01:22:45,721 --> 01:22:46,931
Nope.

952
01:22:47,015 --> 01:22:49,892
Quit kidding, Matunas.
It was dark in that alley.

953
01:22:49,976 --> 01:22:52,353
The freak was trying to kill me!

954
01:22:52,437 --> 01:22:55,898
He had a scar
across his neck.

955
01:22:55,940 --> 01:22:57,859
That ain't him.

956
01:22:57,942 --> 01:22:59,569
Shit.

957
01:23:02,029 --> 01:23:03,447
Depressed?

958
01:23:03,489 --> 01:23:04,949
Yeah.

959
01:23:05,032 --> 01:23:08,119
You don't know grunt
about depressed.

960
01:23:08,202 --> 01:23:10,580
I got me a .357.

961
01:23:10,663 --> 01:23:13,083
Got me a trunk load
of shotguns.

962
01:23:13,166 --> 01:23:15,251
I got three big-bore
battle rifles...

963
01:23:15,334 --> 01:23:16,335
ammo up the ass...

964
01:23:16,418 --> 01:23:18,254
and I ain't safe!

965
01:23:18,337 --> 01:23:19,922
I can't protect myself!

966
01:23:20,005 --> 01:23:21,924
Okay, take it easy, pal.

967
01:23:22,008 --> 01:23:23,885
That weirdo, man.

968
01:23:23,968 --> 01:23:27,013
He got up after I put
enough lead in him...

969
01:23:27,096 --> 01:23:28,514
to drop a rhino.

970
01:23:28,598 --> 01:23:30,892
Hey, listen,
could you work...

971
01:23:30,975 --> 01:23:32,977
with one of our artists?

972
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:35,479
Get a picture of this guy?

973
01:23:35,563 --> 01:23:37,648
Sure, sure.

974
01:23:37,731 --> 01:23:40,818
Thanks.
Take it easy, pal.

975
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:42,403
Hey, cop.

976
01:23:42,486 --> 01:23:43,487
Yeah.

977
01:23:43,571 --> 01:23:46,282
I know you guys
think I'm nuts...

978
01:23:46,366 --> 01:23:49,327
but there's something else
I gotta tell you.

979
01:23:49,410 --> 01:23:52,830
After he threw me
against the wall--

980
01:24:12,350 --> 01:24:14,185
This is like
"One Step Beyond".

981
01:24:14,227 --> 01:24:16,812
All we got is an eyewitness.

982
01:24:16,896 --> 01:24:19,190
Don't say anything
about sword fights...

983
01:24:19,273 --> 01:24:21,275
or guys glowing in the dark
for Christ's sake.

984
01:24:22,819 --> 01:24:24,403
Hey, Moran!

985
01:24:24,487 --> 01:24:26,405
Have you read this?

986
01:24:26,489 --> 01:24:30,576
Are you kidding?
You know cops can't read.

987
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:33,413
What does "incompetent" mean?

988
01:24:33,496 --> 01:24:34,914
That mayor.

989
01:24:34,998 --> 01:24:38,960
He calls me at 2:00
in the morning.

990
01:24:39,043 --> 01:24:41,921
I don't answer
the phone anymore.

991
01:24:42,004 --> 01:24:44,799
What does "baffled" mean?

992
01:25:15,913 --> 01:25:19,416
Karen Joan Nash.

993
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:22,420
Yeah, I remember her.

994
01:25:22,503 --> 01:25:24,922
I was practicing
in Syracuse.

995
01:25:25,006 --> 01:25:27,425
Didn't get many of these.

996
01:25:27,467 --> 01:25:28,968
What?

997
01:25:29,010 --> 01:25:30,428
Unwed mothers.

998
01:25:30,469 --> 01:25:33,097
Nowadays, that's no big deal.

999
01:25:33,139 --> 01:25:36,184
Back then, in Syracuse...

1000
01:25:36,267 --> 01:25:38,937
that was a stoning offense.

1001
01:25:39,020 --> 01:25:40,605
What happened?

1002
01:25:40,688 --> 01:25:43,899
She had the baby,
and she died.

1003
01:25:43,983 --> 01:25:45,401
So Nash was illegitimate.

1004
01:25:45,484 --> 01:25:48,070
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, he was illegitimate...

1005
01:25:48,154 --> 01:25:50,573
for about a minute and a half.

1006
01:25:50,656 --> 01:25:52,950
He died right after she did.

1007
01:25:57,288 --> 01:25:59,040
He died.

1008
01:26:09,508 --> 01:26:10,385
Hello, Brenda.

1009
01:26:10,468 --> 01:26:12,387
I did what you asked.

1010
01:26:12,470 --> 01:26:16,265
I went through the deeds
to Nash's house...

1011
01:26:16,349 --> 01:26:18,768
back through
five previous owners...

1012
01:26:18,810 --> 01:26:21,812
to the original guy,
Montague, in 1796.

1013
01:26:21,979 --> 01:26:23,314
In all five instances...

1014
01:26:23,397 --> 01:26:24,440
Montague through Nash...

1015
01:26:24,523 --> 01:26:25,983
I found a death certificate...

1016
01:26:26,025 --> 01:26:28,111
for a kid with the same name...

1017
01:26:28,194 --> 01:26:29,696
who died at birth...

1018
01:26:29,737 --> 01:26:33,241
years before he pretended to sign
for his inheritance.

1019
01:26:33,324 --> 01:26:36,535
Jesus, Rick, isn't there
any heat in here?

1020
01:26:36,619 --> 01:26:39,372
No. Heat's bad
for the circuits.

1021
01:26:39,455 --> 01:26:41,916
In case
there's any doubt...

1022
01:27:02,228 --> 01:27:04,397
So, what you've
got here, Brenda...

1023
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:07,441
is a guy who's been
creeping around...

1024
01:27:07,525 --> 01:27:09,110
since at least 1700...

1025
01:27:09,193 --> 01:27:11,612
pretending to croak
every so often.

1026
01:27:11,696 --> 01:27:13,114
Leaving all his goods...

1027
01:27:13,197 --> 01:27:15,658
to kids who've been
corpses for years...

1028
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:18,119
and assuming
their identities.

1029
01:27:23,499 --> 01:27:27,628
It's not possible.

1030
01:27:27,711 --> 01:27:29,171
"Post" final!

1031
01:27:29,255 --> 01:27:31,549
Cops release
headhunter picture!

1032
01:27:31,591 --> 01:27:33,050
Reward offered.

1033
01:27:33,092 --> 01:27:34,051
I'll take a "Post."

1034
01:27:34,135 --> 01:27:35,762
Headhunter revealed!

1035
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:12,840
For you, my bonny Heather.

1036
01:28:12,924 --> 01:28:14,926
Happy birthday.

1037
01:28:16,970 --> 01:28:20,848
And you, Juan Ramirez.

1038
01:28:20,932 --> 01:28:24,560
Take care of her,
you overdressed haggis.

1039
01:28:39,951 --> 01:28:41,369
Ha ha ha.

1040
01:28:41,452 --> 01:28:43,371
Ha ha ha.

1041
01:28:43,454 --> 01:28:44,956
Ha ha ha.

1042
01:28:49,794 --> 01:28:51,462
Ha ha ha.

1043
01:29:00,972 --> 01:29:03,433
Kastagir is gone.

1044
01:29:03,516 --> 01:29:05,977
Only you and I remain.

1045
01:29:13,359 --> 01:29:16,404
Nice to see you, Kurgan.

1046
01:29:16,487 --> 01:29:18,573
Who cuts your hair?

1047
01:29:18,656 --> 01:29:21,909
I am in disguise.

1048
01:29:21,993 --> 01:29:25,747
This way no one
will recognize me.

1049
01:29:28,166 --> 01:29:29,500
I do.

1050
01:29:31,002 --> 01:29:32,962
What do you want?

1051
01:29:33,045 --> 01:29:35,381
- Your head.
- Ha ha!

1052
01:29:35,464 --> 01:29:37,342
And the prize.

1053
01:29:38,384 --> 01:29:41,721
Ha ha. Watch.

1054
01:29:41,804 --> 01:29:44,807
Happy Halloween, ladies!

1055
01:29:44,849 --> 01:29:47,018
Blah, blah.

1056
01:29:47,185 --> 01:29:48,645
Blah.

1057
01:29:48,728 --> 01:29:51,522
Blah, blah, blah.

1058
01:29:53,733 --> 01:29:56,444
Nuns. No sense of humor.

1059
01:29:56,527 --> 01:30:00,906
Ramirez's blade did not
cut deeply enough.

1060
01:30:00,948 --> 01:30:04,577
He was right about you.
You're slime.

1061
01:30:04,660 --> 01:30:06,871
Ramirez was an effete snob!

1062
01:30:06,955 --> 01:30:09,332
He died on his knees!

1063
01:30:09,415 --> 01:30:13,377
I took his head
and raped his woman...

1064
01:30:13,419 --> 01:30:16,714
before his blood
was even cold!

1065
01:30:16,756 --> 01:30:18,508
Ha ha ha!

1066
01:30:18,549 --> 01:30:21,052
Ha ha ha!

1067
01:30:24,931 --> 01:30:26,891
I see.

1068
01:30:26,933 --> 01:30:30,020
Ramirez lied.

1069
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:35,399
She was not his woman.

1070
01:30:35,483 --> 01:30:37,568
She was your woman...

1071
01:30:37,610 --> 01:30:41,447
and she never told you.

1072
01:30:41,489 --> 01:30:43,992
I wonder why.

1073
01:30:44,075 --> 01:30:46,452
Perhaps I gave her something...

1074
01:30:46,536 --> 01:30:48,913
you never could...

1075
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:55,419
and secretly she yearned
for my return.

1076
01:30:55,461 --> 01:30:58,464
Holy ground, Highlander!

1077
01:30:58,506 --> 01:31:01,259
Remember what
Ramirez taught you.

1078
01:31:05,012 --> 01:31:08,600
You can't stay
in here forever.

1079
01:31:11,227 --> 01:31:13,437
You are weak, Highlander.

1080
01:31:13,479 --> 01:31:19,360
You will always be
weaker than l.

1081
01:31:23,156 --> 01:31:25,158
I'll be out front.

1082
01:31:29,620 --> 01:31:31,331
Goodbye, Macleod.

1083
01:31:31,414 --> 01:31:35,292
We will meet soon enough.

1084
01:31:38,963 --> 01:31:42,425
Ha ha ha!

1085
01:31:42,508 --> 01:31:44,886
Ha ha ha ha!

1086
01:31:44,969 --> 01:31:47,722
This is the house of God.

1087
01:31:47,805 --> 01:31:50,058
People are trying to pray.

1088
01:31:50,141 --> 01:31:51,684
You're disturbing them.

1089
01:31:53,477 --> 01:31:57,898
He cares about
these helpless mortals?

1090
01:31:57,982 --> 01:31:59,900
Of course he cares.

1091
01:31:59,984 --> 01:32:02,403
He died for our sins.

1092
01:32:02,486 --> 01:32:04,864
That shall be his undoing.

1093
01:32:06,824 --> 01:32:09,327
Father...

1094
01:32:09,410 --> 01:32:11,370
forgive me!

1095
01:32:11,454 --> 01:32:14,415
I am a worm.

1096
01:32:22,131 --> 01:32:24,050
Ha ha ha!

1097
01:32:27,053 --> 01:32:29,764
I have something to say!

1098
01:32:29,847 --> 01:32:32,016
It's better to burn out...

1099
01:32:32,099 --> 01:32:34,811
than to fade away!

1100
01:32:34,894 --> 01:32:36,229
Yah!

1101
01:32:37,605 --> 01:32:39,565
Ha ha ha!

1102
01:32:39,607 --> 01:32:41,067
Ha ha ha!

1103
01:32:41,108 --> 01:32:42,819
Ha ha ha!

1104
01:32:42,860 --> 01:32:44,653
I need to see him, goddamn it!

1105
01:32:44,737 --> 01:32:46,614
I'm afraid that's impossible.

1106
01:32:46,697 --> 01:32:48,574
Mr. Nash is--

1107
01:32:48,658 --> 01:32:50,368
Mr. Nash is dead.

1108
01:32:51,953 --> 01:32:54,997
What are you doing here?

1109
01:32:55,039 --> 01:32:57,666
I'm looking for
a dead guy named Nash.

1110
01:32:57,708 --> 01:32:59,877
He died at birth
in Syracuse, New York.

1111
01:33:04,548 --> 01:33:07,218
All right.

1112
01:33:07,260 --> 01:33:09,220
Come on.

1113
01:33:36,289 --> 01:33:38,332
Are the Claymores real?

1114
01:33:39,792 --> 01:33:41,252
What is this, a museum?

1115
01:33:41,335 --> 01:33:43,838
This stuff
must be worth a fortune.

1116
01:33:52,805 --> 01:33:56,351
I've been alive
for 4 1/2 centuries.

1117
01:33:56,434 --> 01:33:58,269
I cannot die.

1118
01:33:58,353 --> 01:34:00,605
Huh.

1119
01:34:00,688 --> 01:34:03,274
Well, everybody's
got their problems.

1120
01:34:08,154 --> 01:34:11,949
What are you going
to do with that?

1121
01:34:12,033 --> 01:34:13,576
Take it.

1122
01:34:27,048 --> 01:34:31,302
I am Connor Macleod
of the Clan Macleod.

1123
01:34:31,344 --> 01:34:33,513
I was born in 1518...

1124
01:34:33,596 --> 01:34:35,515
in the village of Glenfinnan...

1125
01:34:35,598 --> 01:34:38,017
on the shores of Loch Shiel...

1126
01:34:38,101 --> 01:34:40,311
and I am immortal.

1127
01:34:41,645 --> 01:34:43,480
Aah! Ohh!

1128
01:34:43,522 --> 01:34:46,066
Ohh!

1129
01:34:46,150 --> 01:34:47,610
Ohh!

1130
01:36:20,036 --> 01:36:21,454
You're not listening.

1131
01:36:21,537 --> 01:36:23,456
Brenda, it isn't going to work.

1132
01:36:23,498 --> 01:36:25,458
I can't get involved.
Not again.

1133
01:36:38,304 --> 01:36:40,264
You know what's weird?

1134
01:36:40,306 --> 01:36:43,268
Most people are
afraid to die.

1135
01:36:43,309 --> 01:36:45,770
That's not your problem.

1136
01:36:46,645 --> 01:36:48,230
You're afraid to live.

1137
01:36:53,319 --> 01:36:55,780
Take care of yourself.

1138
01:36:55,863 --> 01:36:57,448
Don't lose your head.

1139
01:37:13,339 --> 01:37:15,633
Hello, pretty.

1140
01:37:15,716 --> 01:37:17,051
Ha!

1141
01:37:17,135 --> 01:37:19,554
Ha ha ha!

1142
01:37:19,637 --> 01:37:22,974
Come on!
Open up!

1143
01:37:29,438 --> 01:37:31,941
Oh, my!

1144
01:37:34,318 --> 01:37:35,361
Aah!

1145
01:37:51,460 --> 01:37:54,130
Ha ha ha!

1146
01:37:54,213 --> 01:37:55,798
Have you ever
played chicken?

1147
01:38:00,511 --> 01:38:02,388
Here we go!

1148
01:38:02,430 --> 01:38:04,891
Ha ha ha!

1149
01:38:04,974 --> 01:38:06,934
Watch out!

1150
01:38:42,803 --> 01:38:44,722
Excuse me!
Ha ha ha!

1151
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:48,893
Oh, no!

1152
01:39:06,995 --> 01:39:09,372
Watch out! A truck!

1153
01:39:09,455 --> 01:39:11,415
Look out!

1154
01:39:18,047 --> 01:39:19,215
Aah!

1155
01:39:27,265 --> 01:39:31,102
* New York, New York *

1156
01:39:31,186 --> 01:39:34,396
* I want to wake up *

1157
01:39:34,438 --> 01:39:35,397
Shut up.

1158
01:39:35,439 --> 01:39:37,483
* ln the city *

1159
01:39:37,566 --> 01:39:39,277
Sing along--
* That never sleeps *

1160
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:41,529
Shut up!

1161
01:39:41,612 --> 01:39:45,783
* To find I'm king of the hill *

1162
01:39:45,866 --> 01:39:47,451
Aah!

1163
01:39:47,535 --> 01:39:48,912
Shut up!

1164
01:39:50,163 --> 01:39:52,707
Shut up!

1165
01:39:52,790 --> 01:39:54,291
* And *

1166
01:39:54,375 --> 01:39:56,669
* lf I can *

1167
01:39:56,753 --> 01:39:59,297
* Make it there *

1168
01:39:59,338 --> 01:40:03,801
* I'll make it anywhere *

1169
01:40:03,843 --> 01:40:06,846
* It's up to you *

1170
01:40:06,888 --> 01:40:08,556
* New York *

1171
01:40:10,308 --> 01:40:12,352
* New *

* Ye-eah *

1175
01:40:21,819 --> 01:40:23,821
* Ye-eah *

1176
01:40:25,323 --> 01:40:28,242
Ha ha ha!

1177
01:40:28,326 --> 01:40:29,660
* Yeah! **

1178
01:40:29,702 --> 01:40:32,080
I can entertain myself.

1179
01:40:32,163 --> 01:40:34,791
Your friend is a real screamer.
Listen.

1180
01:40:34,874 --> 01:40:35,958
Aah! Uhh!

1181
01:40:36,041 --> 01:40:39,378
Which part should
I cut off first?

1182
01:40:39,420 --> 01:40:41,422
I'll be waiting.

1183
01:40:47,386 --> 01:40:50,348
The endless killing
has driven him mad.

1184
01:40:50,390 --> 01:40:52,850
Rachel, there are instructions
in the desk drawer.

1185
01:40:52,892 --> 01:40:54,852
I want you to follow them.

1186
01:40:54,894 --> 01:40:57,354
There's a power of attorney
for you.

1187
01:40:57,396 --> 01:40:59,940
You'll have everything you need.

1188
01:41:00,024 --> 01:41:01,859
You're not coming back.

1189
01:41:02,902 --> 01:41:04,362
Even if you kill him...

1190
01:41:04,404 --> 01:41:06,822
you're not coming back...

1191
01:41:06,906 --> 01:41:08,116
are you?

1192
01:41:16,875 --> 01:41:18,793
Sweet Rachel.

1193
01:41:18,876 --> 01:41:22,630
You always knew
this would happen.

1194
01:41:22,713 --> 01:41:25,049
Russell Nash dies tonight.

1195
01:41:40,105 --> 01:41:43,609
Hey...
it's a kind of magic.

1196
01:41:52,201 --> 01:41:54,412
Goodbye, Russell Nash.

1197
01:42:31,991 --> 01:42:34,202
Aah!

1198
01:43:27,255 --> 01:43:29,006
Aah!

1199
01:44:17,513 --> 01:44:21,392
Aaah!

1200
01:44:48,544 --> 01:44:50,296
Aaah!

1201
01:45:47,979 --> 01:45:49,980
Aaah!

1202
01:46:52,835 --> 01:46:54,670
Ha ha ha!

1203
01:46:56,589 --> 01:46:58,090
Ha ha ha!

1204
01:47:12,605 --> 01:47:15,066
So now it ends.

1205
01:47:15,149 --> 01:47:16,692
Uhh!

1206
01:47:23,533 --> 01:47:26,119
Ha ha ha!

1207
01:47:26,202 --> 01:47:28,371
Ha ha ha!

1208
01:47:28,412 --> 01:47:30,206
Yah!

1209
01:47:33,250 --> 01:47:34,710
What kept you?

1210
01:49:50,096 --> 01:49:52,682
There can be only one!

1211
01:50:08,197 --> 01:50:09,866
Aah!

1212
01:50:09,949 --> 01:50:11,450
Ohh!

1213
01:50:11,534 --> 01:50:14,370
Ohh!

1214
01:50:25,506 --> 01:50:28,426
The quickening overpowers me!

1215
01:50:32,388 --> 01:50:35,391
I know!
I know everything!

1216
01:50:35,558 --> 01:50:37,727
I am everything!

1217
01:50:42,064 --> 01:50:44,525
Oh!

1218
01:50:44,609 --> 01:50:46,194
Oh!

1219
01:50:46,277 --> 01:50:47,362
Oh!

1220
01:50:51,449 --> 01:50:53,367
Uh! Uh!

1221
01:50:53,451 --> 01:50:54,869
Oh!

1222
01:50:54,952 --> 01:50:56,954
Oh!

1223
01:50:58,372 --> 01:51:00,291
Unh!

1224
01:51:37,995 --> 01:51:40,665
this is where it all began.

1225
01:51:40,748 --> 01:51:43,626
Can you tell me
about the prize?

1226
01:51:43,709 --> 01:51:46,629
It's like a whirlwind
in my head.

1227
01:51:46,671 --> 01:51:48,089
But if I concentrate...

1228
01:51:48,172 --> 01:51:50,049
I know what people
are thinking...

1229
01:51:50,132 --> 01:51:51,717
all over the world.

1230
01:51:51,801 --> 01:51:52,927
Presidents...

1231
01:51:53,011 --> 01:51:54,178
diplomats...

1232
01:51:54,262 --> 01:51:55,888
scientists.

1233
01:51:55,972 --> 01:51:58,891
I can help them
understand each other.

1234
01:51:59,976 --> 01:52:01,227
What am I thinking?

1235
01:52:01,311 --> 01:52:02,270
You're thinking...

1236
01:52:02,353 --> 01:52:05,272
whether or not
you can love me.

1237
01:52:05,356 --> 01:52:07,274
You can.
I'm just like you.

1238
01:52:07,358 --> 01:52:09,276
I can love and
have children.

1239
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:11,195
Live and grow old.

1240
01:52:11,279 --> 01:52:13,739
You never prepared
me for that...

1241
01:52:13,781 --> 01:52:15,199
you Spanish peacock.

1242
01:52:15,283 --> 01:52:16,909
Ha ha ha ha.

1243
01:52:16,993 --> 01:52:19,078
Patience, Highlander.

1244
01:52:19,162 --> 01:52:21,456
You have done well.

1245
01:52:21,539 --> 01:52:23,666
But it'll take time.

1246
01:52:23,750 --> 01:52:29,088
You are generations
being born and dying.

1247
01:52:29,171 --> 01:52:31,591
You are at one
with all living things.

1248
01:52:31,674 --> 01:52:34,969
Each man's thoughts and dreams
are yours to know.

1249
01:52:36,596 --> 01:52:39,432
You have power beyond imagination.

1250
01:52:39,557 --> 01:52:42,310
Use it well, my friend.

1251
01:52:42,393 --> 01:52:44,437
Don't lose your head.

1252

1253
