00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,514
- You are an amazingly
talented woman.

3
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:16,782
- Thank you.

4
00:00:16,784 --> 00:00:18,283
- I mean, you have
an amazing voice.

5
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:20,386
I love... I've said
that to you before.

6
00:00:20,388 --> 00:00:21,388
- Thank you.

7
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:24,023
- You're a great artist,
and you write...

8
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:25,124
And you write great songs.

9
00:00:25,126 --> 00:00:26,425
- Thanks.

10
00:00:26,427 --> 00:00:27,559
- I just think
you're so talented.

11
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,094
- Oh, thank you.

12
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:31,697
- Are you surprised
by all the attention

13
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:34,500
that is going on right now
surrounding you?

14
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:36,235
- To be honest, Ellen, no.

15
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:39,204
I'm just so excited to announce
my record with Kanye

16
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,073
and my movie
with Robert Pattinson

17
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:43,475
that is gonna do great
in theaters.

18
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:45,077
- We're gonna do
"would you rather."

19
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:46,779
Would you rather date
Robert Pattinson

20
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:48,080
or Taylor Lautner?

21
00:00:48,082 --> 00:00:49,214
- Oh!

22
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:51,183
You're so bad.

23
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:54,820
I have a boyfriend,
Ryan Gosling.

24
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:58,057
But, actually,
on a serious note,

25
00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:00,826
Ryan and I will be going
back to my hometown

26
00:01:00,828 --> 00:01:03,195
to open an owl sanctuary.

27
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:07,199
My dumb hometown.

28

Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

29
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:27,412
- Excuse me.

30
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:30,415
- I have a question
about the metal.

31
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:32,417
I... can I just dump this?

32
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:33,886
I have a used kettle.

33
00:02:33,888 --> 00:02:35,420
Do I put it
in the regular trash,

34
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:39,558
or do I put it...
- Plug-in or stove-top?

35
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,726
- Plug-in.

36
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:52,771
- Hey, Rich.

37
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,273
- Hey, Dave.
Dale around?

38
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:55,340
- Yeah, he's inside.

39
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,708
- Who's she?

40
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,710
- I don't know.

41
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,578
New, I guess.

42
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,580
- Man, there's more and more
of them every day, right?

43
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:02,881
Fucking "citiots."

44
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:04,550
- Hey, did you get
your road paved yet?

45
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:06,485
- Don't start in on that shit
with me, Dave.

46
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:08,287
- That's your tax dollars,
you know.

47
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:10,189
I wrote two letters to the ACLU

48
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:11,557
because I didn't get
my due allotted time

49
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:13,425
at a town council meeting.

50
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,430
- See, the problem is,

51
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:21,733
you've got these troglodytes
running everything,

52
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,936
and guess what direction
they're running towards:

53
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:25,237
the ground.

54
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:26,738
Everything.

55
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,408
Every institution that
these morons deem precious...

56
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:35,214
The IMF, the UN, the DEA,
FDA, HEF, CDC, everything...

57
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:37,549
Is being run
right into the ground.

58
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,484
And they're all
in collusion with each other.

59
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:41,220
That's how it works.

60
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:43,889
You have been sold a false
bill of goods, my friends,

61
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:47,893
and now it's time
for these insipid ignoramuses

62
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,596
to crawl back
under the rocks they came from

63
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:52,965
and leave the seeding
and the flowering of liberty

64
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:55,400
to those that can nurture
and care for it:

65
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,702
you and me, my friends.

66
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:59,271
We need to drain the swamp.

67
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:01,773
Top of the next hour,

68
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,675
we're gonna talk
to Lieutenant Grace Rittle,

69
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:04,810
ex-military command...

70
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:28,400
- Day 128.

71
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,660
- Hello, Mr. Stuben.

72
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:56,428
This is Megyn McKibbons

73
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,930
with the Montgomery County
Commissioner's Office.

74
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:02,334
We received your emails
and phone messages.

75
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:04,036
As you are aware,
the council meets every...

76
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:05,604
- I already knew that.

77
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:07,706
- And council meetings
are open to the public.

78
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,808
Public comment
may be made in person

79
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,877
at the county council meeting

80
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:16,381
or prior to the meeting
via regular U.S. mail.

81
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:27,626
- Hi, Dad!

82
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:28,994
- Hey.

83
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,696
- Oh, my god, I have to ask you
a huge favor.

84
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:31,897
- I need to borrow...
- Here we go.

85
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:33,065
- Borrow, not take or have.

86
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:34,933
I need to borrow $300.

87
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,802
- I don't have that kind of
money to throw around, Katelyn.

88
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:38,070
- I know, Dad; I know, I know.

89
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:39,705
But it's really,
really important.

90
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:41,440
It's for my demo.

91
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:42,741
My friend Julie... you know her;
you really like her.

92
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:44,109
She has a cousin;
he's super cool.

93
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:46,411
Okay, Dad, he has a studio
in his house.

94
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:48,447
He'll let me record my demo
in his house.

95
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:50,649
- But I thought<i> American Idol</i>
already said no.

96
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:51,983
- God, Dad,
it's not<i> American Idol.</i>

97
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:53,051
I already told you that.

98
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:54,786
It's<i> The Voice.</i>

99
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:56,888
Shakira's on it.

100
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,357
- Babe, I just don't have
that kind of money.

101
00:05:58,359 --> 00:05:59,758
Besides, you still owe me

102
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,126
the money you borrowed
to get the car fixed.

103
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:02,627
- I know, I know, I know
I still owe you for that.

104
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:03,662
Dad, just please, please,

105
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:04,996
just add it to what I owe you.

106
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,098
- Babe, I just don't
have any cash.

107
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,599
I really don't.

108
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:09,468
- Okay, well, then, like,
$100, then?

109
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,503
Because I'm gonna have $200
left over after rent this month.

110
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:12,938
Is that good?

111
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,506
- I mean, what if you just
move back in for a bit?

112
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:15,774
- Oh, my god, Dad, no.

113
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:16,942
And I'm working
at the Tap tonight.

114
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:18,443
That's my third shift this week,

115
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:19,911
so I'll definitely
have the money

116
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:21,513
by, like, next Friday or
the Friday after that for sure.

117
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:22,948
- Have you asked your mom?
She could maybe...

118
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,716
- She's at Mohican Sun
with T.J. and Dave.

119
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,918
Come on, who the fuck knows
when she'll be back?

120
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,122
Oh, my god.

121
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:31,490
Oh, thank you.

122
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:33,492
- I don't know what I have.

123
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:34,526
Is that okay?

124
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:35,594
- Dad, thank you.

125
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:37,462
Oh, my god!

126
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:38,597
- Okay, okay.

127
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:39,664
- Thank you!

128
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:40,866
- Hey, hey.

129
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:41,933
You want to stick around
for dinner?

130
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,468
I got Old El Paso taco shells.

131
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,603
- Oh, I love those.

132
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:46,037
I can't, though,

133
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,739
'cause I got to talk to Julie
about recording.

134
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,007
- Okay.

135
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,542
Yeah, I've been
making tacos myself.

136
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:51,910
- Oh, that's great!

137
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,145
- I just cut up a turkey burger
or meat loaf.

138
00:06:53,147 --> 00:06:54,479
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

139
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:55,647
It's like a Southwestern taco.

140
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:56,715
- That sounds good, Dad.

141
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:58,483
- Yeah, it's good.

142
00:06:58,485 --> 00:06:59,751
Come by tomorrow night;
I'll be here.

143
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,019
- Okay, Dad.

144
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,521
- And watch out
for that goddamn pothole, okay?

145
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:03,722
- All right.

146
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:04,790
I love you.

147
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:05,792
- Love you too, Honey.

148
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:06,958
- Thanks.

149
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:34,085
- 'Sup, Katelyn?

150
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:35,220
- Hi, Cory.

151
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:37,622
- Looking good.

152
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,691
You working at the Tap tonight?

153
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:41,493
- No shit, Sherlock.

154
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:43,061
- You know, I was thinking
about swinging by there later.

155
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,763
- Oh, my god, yeah?
- Yeah.

156
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:46,097
- I'll tell Julie;
we'd love to have you.

157
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:47,499
We'll give you a vodka-soda...
Not!

158
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:48,667
Motherfucker!

159
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,203
- Shut up.

160
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:26,872
Are you for reals?

161
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:28,206
Julie, look, look!

162
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,175
- That's so cool.

163
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,843
Who's on the cover?

164
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,845
Oh, god, I hate that bitch.

165
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,013
She's so nothing.

166
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,281
I can't.

167
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:38,283
I told you,
I'm at the Tap tonight.

168
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:41,887
I know, you're, like,
officially famous now.

169
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:43,255
Yeah.

170
00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:44,689
- Oh, my god, your iPhone case
is so cool.

171
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,691
It's a tree stump.

172
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,092
- No, it's a turtle.

173
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:48,260
- It's a tree stump.
- It's a turtle.

174
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:49,528
Shut up, bye.

175
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,762
Guess what; you'll never guess.

176
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:52,731
- What?
- Amber Hartley got published.

177
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,099
- What?

178
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:55,667
Like, where?

179
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:56,902
- In this week's
<i>People</i> magazine,

180
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:58,103
the one with Katy Perry
on the cover.

181
00:08:58,105 --> 00:08:59,804
She got a letter published,

182
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,172
like, congratulating them

183
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:03,208
on their coverage
of the Bristol Palin story.

184
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,544
It has her name,
the town of Liberty, all that.

185
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:06,845
<i>People</i> magazine!

186
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:07,979
Pretty cool.

187
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,581
- I mean, I guess that's cool.

188
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,217
Where'd you get that case?

189
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:13,219
I really want one.

190
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,319
It's so cool.

191
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:15,321
- I got it from Etsy.

192
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:17,055
- Who's that?

193
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,558
- Shut up, you mean
you've never heard of Etsy?

194
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,860
- Oh, the Jewish girl
from the canoe rental place?

195
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:24,329
- No, it's a website, Etsy.

196
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:25,964
It's a crafts website.

197
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:26,966
Oh, my god!

198
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,166
You're gonna freak.

199
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:29,901
Actually, I was just
about to buy

200
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,804
this super cute hand-knit
baby sweater hoodie thing.

201
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:33,838
Look.

202
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,140
- Another fucking baby shower.

203
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:37,609
It's, like,
my fifth this summer.

204
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:38,810
Oh, my god!

205
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,011
That is so cute.

206
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,046
- Right?

207
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:42,581
It says, "Property of no one.

208
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,282
I am a human being;
I am not property."

209
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:46,251
Which is perfect, 'cause of
Courtney's trial and all.

210
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:47,652
- Uh-huh.

211
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:48,887
- This lady in Brooklyn
makes them.

212
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:50,288
- How is it vegan?

213
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:56,161
- Oh, hey,
just got another order

214
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:58,163
for the feminist theory onesie.

215
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:01,333
- Oh, cool,
it's shipping to Park Slope?

216
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:04,069
- No, Upstate.

217
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:05,270
- Really?
- Yeah.

218
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,638
- Huh.

219
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,006
- Yeah... oh, FYI,

220
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:10,075
I'm down to the last batch
of boxes, Honey.

221
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:11,376
- Oh, I know, I'm on it.

222
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:13,044
By the way, Baby,

223
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,279
it won't be long before
I don't need to rely

224
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,014
on the mill anymore at all,

225
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:18,016
because I'm getting
really super good

226
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:21,620
at the wood pulp processing part
myself.

227
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:22,921
- That would be so great.

228
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:24,356
- I know, freedom.

229
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:25,358
- Yeah.

230
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:27,693
- I think it's Bennie.

231
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:28,694
Let me check.

232
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:30,161
- Oh, little Bennie.

233
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:32,631
- Bennie.

234
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,065
Hey, Bennie, come on in.

235
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,834
- Hi, Bennie, how's it going?

236
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:36,836
- Did you get here safe?

237
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:38,003
- Yeah, all good, all good.

238
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:39,070
How's biz?

239
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:40,171
- Oh, you know, it's good.

240
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:41,239
It's pretty sweet, you know?

241
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:42,841
- Yeah, it's really good.

242
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:43,843
- Yeah, good.

243
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:44,876
- Do you want some sun tea?

244
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:46,078
- No, no, no, I really cannot.

245
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,079
- Oh, okay.

246
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:49,748
- So, all good?

247
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,815
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

248
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:51,883
Oh, you need to get that?

249
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:53,151
- No, no, it's fine.

250
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,819
It's fine.

251
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,755
Good, how's the box thing
you wanted to do?

252
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:58,123
- Oh, you know, it's good.

253
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,358
I'm really, like,
mentally, like, fit,

254
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,994
but, like, I think
just distressing

255
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,697
that people don't care
about homemade,

256
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:08,433
hand-crafted cardboard boxes,
you know?

257
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:10,769
It's a beautiful process.

258
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:14,372
Oh, you need money.

259
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:15,907
- Yeah.

260
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:16,975
Great, oh, yeah.

261
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:18,343
- There you go.
- Thank you.

262
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,412
Sweet,
so this is the Devastator.

263
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:21,880
I'm all out
of Crimson Nightshade,

264
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:23,214
but this is really similar.

265
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:26,685
- Oh... um...
- It is really similar.

266
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,319
It's, like, maybe
a bit more of an up.

267
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:29,321
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

268
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:30,322
No, no, no.

269
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:32,023
Sure, sure, sure.

270
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,459
It's just that
Crimson Nightshade

271
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:37,696
is, like, my special weed.

272
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:39,798
- Well, you know, this is
pretty much the same thing.

273
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,199
I mean, I got
President's Choice.

274
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:44,436
I got Queef Latina,
Young Philosopher.

275
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:46,271
Corduroy Pillows,
They're Making Headlines,

276
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:48,139
Black History Month.

277
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,341
It's all, like, you know,
pretty mellow body-high stuff.

278
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:53,078
- Yeah, well, see,
the thing is, like,

279
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,980
Crim Shade gets me these ideas,

280
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:58,283
like, I never otherwise
would have thought of.

281
00:11:58,285 --> 00:11:59,350
- Yeah.

282
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:00,919
- Oh, Bennie, I'm so sorry.

283
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:02,120
- No, it's cool.
- Yeah, no.

284
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:03,122
- It's cool.

285
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:04,122
I should have some by tomorrow.

286
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:05,190
- Totally sorry.

287
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:06,352
- I'll swing by then, yeah.

288
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:08,226
- You can get that.

289
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,260
- No, I'm gonna take off.

290
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:10,829
And I'll see you tomorrow.

291
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:11,896
- Are you sure we can't
get you something?

292
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:12,897
- No, I'm all good, thanks.

293
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,232
Yeah, thanks, Maddy.

294
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,400
No, I'll just see y'all
tomorrow, okay?

295
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:16,434
- Yeah, yeah, tomorrow, sure.

296
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:17,769
- Yeah, Crimson Nightshade.

297
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:19,003
Oh, shit, okay.

298
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:20,205
I got to run.

299
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:21,406
- Yeah, you want me
to help you out?

300
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:22,408
- Please.

301
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,842
- The steps are uneven.

302
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:25,076
- Yeah, I know.

303
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,444
- Sometimes they catch
on bike wheels.

304
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:27,446
- Bye.

305
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:29,114
- Okay, bye.

306
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:30,749
You know what,
I got to talk to the city.

307
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:32,351
We need to, like, have
really much safer,

308
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,919
like, bike-friendly steps.

309
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:39,425
Baby... Sweetie-pie...
Honey-bear...

310
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:40,426
- I know, I know.

311
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,527
No, I know, it's just... - What?

312
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:45,163
- I just really want...
- Shh.

313
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:46,898
You know we can't.

314
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,433
Not us; we can't.

315
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,404
- Hey, smart-ass.

316
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:55,039
I know you hit "ignore,"

317
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,542
because it's going
straight to voicemail.

318
00:12:57,544 --> 00:13:00,411
Look, I have
a town council tonight,

319
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:02,247
but I need to talk to you
about your brother,

320
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:03,982
so call me back.

321
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:06,417
Okay, Hon, love you, bye.

322
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,390
- Hey, Ms. Casserta.

323
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:15,493
You got another message from
that guy Dave Stuben again.

324
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:18,196
- Oh, for Chrissakes,
that pain in the ass.

325
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:19,198
- What should I do?

326
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:20,865
- Ignore it.

327
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:22,934
How many times do I have to
tell that guy

328
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:24,469
the same thing
over and over again?

329
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,271
- Should I respond to him?

330
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:27,438
- What?

331
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,808
I just said ignore it.

332
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,342
I got to go to Wal-Mart,

333
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:33,344
pick up that crap
for the meeting.

334
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:44,582
- Did you watch last night?

335
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:46,351
- <i> Teen Mom?</i>
Yeah.

336
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:48,086
- Can you believe Brooklyn?

337
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:49,554
- She called the cops
on her fucking mom.

338
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:50,556
Like, who does that?

339
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,323
- Yeah, that, but...

340
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:54,425
she's giving out an award
at the<i> MTV Movie Awards.</i>

341
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:55,994
- Her?

342
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:58,062
- I mean, I guess
she's famous now, so...

343
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,231
- Speaking of famous,
I forgot to tell you...

344
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,499
my dad gave me the money.

345
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:03,167
- Awesome.

346
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:05,136
I'll tell Julian
you're ready for the recording.

347
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:06,971
- What are you talking about?
What recording?

348
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:09,340
- Oh, didn't I tell you
about getting on<i> The Voice?</i>

349
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:11,075
- Huh?
- Yep.

350
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,577
Gonna make my audition,
send it in,

351
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,579
and then I will be
on<i> The Voice</i> this season.

352
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,347
- Ha-ha, yeah, right.

353
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:17,949
- What are you gonna sing?

354
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:19,584
- <i> Brave</i> by the artist
Sara Bareilles.

355
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:20,586
- Ha-ha!

356
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:21,587
Ah-ha-ha!

357
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:22,987
Oh!

358
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:24,188
- Fuck you, Christian.
- Enough.

359
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,456
Christian, go clean out
the walk-in.

360
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,225
Julie, keep restocking.

361
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:30,061
Katelyn, I want
to talk to you outside.

362
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,701
Oh, it's bright.

363
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,948
So... you got an audition
for<i> The Voice.</i>

364
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,416
- Yeah.

365
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:53,117
- What, they said
they'd just audition you?

366
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,552
'Cause that's usually
not how it works.

367
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:55,720
- Yeah.

368
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:57,255
I'm sending in a recording,

369
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:59,324
and I will get an audition.

370
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:01,492
They told me that my last demo
was so good

371
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:04,062
but that it was too low-quality
'cause I did it on my iPhone,

372
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:06,264
so I get to do
a professional recording.

373
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:07,598
- Okay, well, you know,

374
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,334
they probably get
a lot of submissions,

375
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:11,002
so I don't want you to get
your hopes up too high.

376
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:12,003
- Yeah, thank you, Crystal.

377
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:13,004
They told me that as well.

378
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:14,006
- Who?
Who said?

379
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:15,007
- Who?

380
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:16,507
The person I spoke to.

381
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:17,509
- The receptionist?

382
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:19,511
That's funny.

383
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:21,412
No, not the receptionist.

384
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:23,514
I don't know her exact
president title, or whatever.

385
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,083
The person that works there.

386
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:26,551
- Okay, well,
I just want you to know

387
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:27,986
it's not that easy, Katelyn.

388
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,454
- Crystal...

389
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:31,022
- No, I mean, they don't
care about you at all.

390
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:32,490
These shows just use you
and drop you

391
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,292
the second they don't
have any use for you.

392
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:36,494
- Sweetie,
that was<i> Star Search Junior,</i>

393
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,463
and that was a long time ago.

394
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:40,331
This is<i> The Voice.</i>

395
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,566
It's totally different.

396
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,741
- Wash your hands.

397
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:03,554
- Hey, girl.

398
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,523
- Hi, Cory.

399
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:14,699
Dude, do you want something?

400
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:18,503
Like...
- Yeah, I was wondering...

401
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:20,638
Gotcha, bitch!

402
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,722
- And I was like, "Hello!"

403
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,557
Cars are fishtailing everywhere.

404
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,392
I don't care
if it's not your department.

405
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,760
I'm gonna keep calling

406
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,362
until somebody does something
about this.

407
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:46,130
So anyway,
I made another phone call

408
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,799
to the other department

409
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:51,135
and said that it's time for
something to be done about this.

410
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:52,603
And I called
the police department,

411
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:54,839
and they said
it wasn't an emergency.

412
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:57,542
And I said... - Time.

413
00:17:57,544 --> 00:17:58,743
- "What do I have to do,
wait until I kill somebody?"

414
00:17:58,745 --> 00:17:59,745
- Time, Mrs. Torelli.

415
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,245
- Thank you.

416
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,521
- Dave Stuben.

417
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:22,400
- Dave Stuben,
16 Boylston Street.

418
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:23,835
Good evening,
President Casserta,

419
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:25,670
trustees, citizens.

420
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:27,472
- Dave, I want to remind you...

421
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:29,307
- Thank you for the right to
speak without interruption!

422
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:31,542
- I would appreciate it
if you didn't yell at me, Dave.

423
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:32,743
- Reset the timer.

424
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:34,412
- Dave.

425
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:37,348
- Upon my behalf,
I want it noted in the record

426
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:41,352
that this is
an official complaint.

427
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:43,154
- We're not gonna do that, Dave.

428
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:46,257
- Okay, then I want it noted
in the record that, once again,

429
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:49,127
I was denied
my unalienable right

430
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:53,898
from the Constitution
and Declaration of Independence.

431
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,700
- Terrific, noted.

432
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:57,268
- Okay.

433
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:01,405
So... February 6th, last year,
for the record,

434
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:03,908
I said to Mr. Hurlickson,

435
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:08,546
I said, "Go get
geothermal desalinization."

436
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:13,184
And you did not bring this up to
the water department, did you?

437
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:15,853
And now I notice,
driving through town,

438
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:18,923
that there is garbage
everywhere, everywhere.

439
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:21,792
Just like Mr. Hernandez said,
yeah.

440
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:23,694
And it's a disgrace,

441
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:26,397
because anybody driving
through our town

442
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:29,534
would assume that it's
just a great big slum.

443
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:32,904
And Liberty has gotten
really ugly since the snow melt

444
00:19:32,906 --> 00:19:35,339
after the St. Patrick's Day
snowstorm.

445
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,208
Have you noticed?
Have you noticed?

446
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,476
And there's potholes.

447
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:40,878
Potholes everywhere,
Ms. Casserta.

448
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,949
There are potholes
on my street, Boylston Street,

449
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:48,953
and there are potholes on...

450
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:54,825
Chandler Street
and Benton Avenue...

451
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:59,430
and... Willow Street.

452
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:01,432
Potholes on Willow Street.

453
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:03,668
And Railroad Avenue.

454
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,436
And the list goes on and on.

455
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:07,205
There are potholes everywhere.

456
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:11,275
And I think it's a disgrace
that the DPW

457
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:14,512
did not go out to where I live
and manage the overflow

458
00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:16,214
on my street, Boylston Street.

459
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:19,483
And they never plowed my street,
Ms. Casserta.

460
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:20,985
They never plowed it.

461
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:23,721
And there was a veterinarian
who was on our street

462
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:28,426
to save Ms. Capelli's dog,
who was stuck on the road.

463
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:30,528
And the people had
to push her car.

464
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,597
And guess what.

465
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:36,567
That dog died because
she couldn't get to it.

466
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,604
So you have blood on your hands
of a dead dog.

467
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:41,239
You've all killed a dog.

468
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,441
And I would like to know if...

469
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:46,777
What other rental vehicles
were out there, okay?

470
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:48,446
Because we have potholes.

471
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:51,315
- Time.
- We have pot... we have potholes.

472
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:52,917
- Time.
Thank you, Mr. Stuben.

473
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,486
- Well, and I think it's
a crying shame, Ms. Casserta,

474
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:56,821
and you should table this.

475
00:20:56,823 --> 00:20:59,523
You and Mr. Hurlickson
should table this,

476
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:02,426
because this town is a farce!

477
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:05,329
- Time, Mr. Stuben.

478
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:07,832
- I can speak if I want to.
- You just did.

479
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:10,668
- Oh, and where
in the Constitution does it say

480
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:13,037
that a man only has
three minutes to speak?

481
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,739
Show me, Ms. Casserta!

482
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:16,607
- We all have rules
that we need to follow, Dave.

483
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:17,708
- There are no rules!

484
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,743
There's no Robert's Rules.

485
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:19,777
There are no rules!

486
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:20,945
I have a right to speak.

487
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:22,847
- Dave, we will
have you arrested

488
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:24,649
if you don't leave, please.

489
00:21:24,651 --> 00:21:26,017
- This is a waste
of taxpayers' money.

490
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:27,652
- We've told you this before.

491
00:21:27,654 --> 00:21:29,487
- This whole town council
is under suspicion.

492
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:30,921
- Give us a break, Dave.
- A break?

493
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:32,957
You want a break?
You should give us a break.

494
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,525
Because you should be...

495
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:35,826
- That's it.
You've been warned.

496
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:38,396
Arrest Mr. Stuben
for disruptive behavior.

497
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:39,598
- You're gonna arrest me?
Fine!

498
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:41,032
I will sue you, Ms. Casserta!

499
00:21:41,034 --> 00:21:42,800
I will sue the city council.

500
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,002
I will sue the panel.

501
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:46,937
I will sue everyone
in this city!

502
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:48,306
Excuse me, I need to get...

503
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:49,974
I have a right to my things.

504
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:52,310
I am a citizen.
This is America.

505
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:54,312
You cannot take things
from people.

506
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:55,713
I have a freedom of speech!

507
00:21:55,715 --> 00:21:57,748
I demand three more minutes!

508
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,984
I request my rights
as a citizen!

509
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:02,520
And I can talk over you
without a microphone.

510
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:03,888
You will hear me!

511
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,357
Mel, Mel,
just take a stand, Mel.

512
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,758
- Who's next?
- You will hear me!

513
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,093
- Humella Alderton.

514
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,964
- Crimson Nightshade,
as requested.

515
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:14,999
- Yes!

516
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:16,701
- Okay, ka-pow.

517
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:17,802
- Okay, fair trade.

518
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:19,503
- All right, thanks, man.

519
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,706
Oh, I got to show you
this crazy, fucked-up thing

520
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:24,108
that happened last night
at my mom's council meeting.

521
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,876
This guy went off.

522
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:26,944
He got arrested.

523
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:28,612
- Wait, no.

524
00:22:28,614 --> 00:22:30,381
- Yeah, he's always showing up
and ranting.

525
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:31,615
- What?

526
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:33,017
- Last night.

527
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:34,819
- And this was at a meeting?

528
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:36,454
- It's a crying shame,
Ms. Casserta,

529
00:22:36,456 --> 00:22:37,655
and you should table this.

530
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:40,491
You and Mr. Hurlickson... - No.

531
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:42,960
Well, he has passion.

532
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,363
Fucking lunatic.

533
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,565
- Well, he's clearly disturbed.

534
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:48,833
- Oh, no shit, yeah.

535
00:22:48,835 --> 00:22:50,401
- Are there more videos
of this guy?

536
00:22:50,403 --> 00:22:51,535
- Yeah, there's a bunch, yeah.

537
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:52,803
Just Google "Dave Stuben."

538
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:54,138
Actually, just Google

539
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,140
"crazy motherfuckers
at town hall meetings."

540
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:57,875
There's, like,
a million of these people.

541
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,410
- There are no rules!

542
00:22:59,412 --> 00:23:00,778
- You can spend a whole day
watching it.

543
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,879
Oh, all right, thanks, guys.

544
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,381
That felt good.

545
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:05,149
- Hey, don't be a stranger,
okay?

546
00:23:05,151 --> 00:23:07,518
I mean, our door
is open anytime.

547
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,786
It doesn't even have to be

548
00:23:08,788 --> 00:23:10,454
the purchasing
or the buying of weed

549
00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:12,790
or the selling of weed involved,
you know?

550
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:14,125
I mean, just come on by.

551
00:23:14,127 --> 00:23:17,094
Like, just raid the fridge,
do some laundry.

552
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:18,396
- Okay.
- Yeah.

553
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:19,830
Or maybe you and Donovan

554
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:21,799
could go to a baseball game
together sometime.

555
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:23,434
- I don't know baseball.

556
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:24,535
- Donovan...

557
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:27,805
- Oh, yeah, you know,
yeah, we can...

558
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:29,874
Yeah, we could go baseball
sometime.

559
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:31,409
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

560
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:32,610
That could be fun, kiddo.

561
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:34,044
- Yeah.
- Afternoon outside.

562
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:36,514
- Want to go
for the whole nine innings

563
00:23:36,516 --> 00:23:38,048
and, like, you know, outside

564
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,817
in the big stadium
with all the people?

565
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:41,085
It could be fun.

566
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:42,820
- Yeah, I could even,
like, maybe...

567
00:23:42,822 --> 00:23:44,555
I'll just bring, like,
five friends or something.

568
00:23:44,557 --> 00:23:45,923
- Or it could just be
the two of you.

569
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,591
- Yeah?

570
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:48,893
- Yeah, I could pick you up,
or we could meet there.

571
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:50,461
We could go
to a papuseria there,

572
00:23:50,463 --> 00:23:51,829
or just, like, outside of it.

573
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:53,097
They might not have them
in the stadiums.

574
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:55,666
- No, no, I'll meet you there.

575
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:57,768
It's just kind of easier
for you.

576
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:58,836
- I'll buy you a glove.

577
00:23:58,838 --> 00:24:01,138
We'll go to the game,
and then we can...

578
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,973
You know, we could throw a...

579
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:04,542
Throw a pitch afterwards.

580
00:24:04,544 --> 00:24:06,577
- That would be so fun.

581
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:08,078
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
for sure.

582
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,147
Total fun, total fun, yeah.

583
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:11,649
- You know what?

584
00:24:11,651 --> 00:24:13,117
We're gonna do
a four-leaf clover

585
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,852
scavenger hunt next weekend,
if you want to come.

586
00:24:14,854 --> 00:24:16,220
- Oh, yeah, works for me.

587
00:24:16,222 --> 00:24:17,755
- Stay for a snack.
- Yeah, oh, actually...

588
00:24:17,757 --> 00:24:18,856
- Thank you, again.

589
00:24:18,858 --> 00:24:19,890
Thank you so much.

590
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:20,892
- Okay, okay.

591
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:22,026
- Okay.
- Cool, cool.

592
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:23,561
- Bye, Bennie.
Bye, Sweetheart.

593
00:24:23,563 --> 00:24:24,563
- Bye.

594
00:24:24,564 --> 00:24:26,831
- Bye-ee.

595
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:28,599
- Such a sweet kid.

596
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:32,236
I mean, I want one.

597
00:24:32,238 --> 00:24:33,571
I really want one.

598
00:24:33,573 --> 00:24:34,872
- I know, baby.

599
00:24:34,874 --> 00:24:36,540
You say that
every time he comes over.

600
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:39,143
I wish things were different,
but they're not.

601
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:41,512
- Yeah, I know.

602
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:47,251
Just gonna get back to it.

603
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:48,986
You know, I just... I don't feel
like working anymore.

604
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,588
I'm just gonna go take a bath.

605
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:54,492
I'm gonna go take
a childless bath.

606
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:55,659
- Okay.

607
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:59,630
- I demand three more minutes!

608
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:11,709
Hi, I'm Katelyn.

609
00:25:11,711 --> 00:25:12,843
- Hey.

610
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:16,580
- I'm...

611
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:18,682
I met you at Justin's
graduation party

612
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:19,884
at Liberty Lake that one time.

613
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:21,252
- Yeah, yeah, no, I know.

614
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:30,261
- Oh, Julie told you
about recording, right?

615
00:25:30,263 --> 00:25:31,562
- Yeah.

616
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,066
- Oh, like, today, right?

617
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:37,268
- Yeah.

618
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:43,574
- Can I come in?

619
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:45,743
- Yeah, of course.

620
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:47,745
It'll take me a second
to finish setting up.

621
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:49,847
Do you want to smoke up?

622
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:51,015
- Later.

623
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:52,316
My voice.

624
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,252
Oh, hey, Julian...

625
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:57,288
do you happen to have
any hot tea

626
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,557
with lemon and honey and stuff?

627
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:01,325
It's really important
for my voice.

628
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:05,129
- I have hot water, not
those other things.

629
00:26:05,131 --> 00:26:06,131
- That's okay.

630
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:08,065
I have mentholated cough drops.

631
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,733
- You're just doing
the one song, right?

632
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:10,901
- Yes.

633
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:13,637
- And you have the money?

634
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:15,239
- I do.

635
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:16,774
I'm so excited.

636
00:26:17,777 --> 00:26:19,143
- Here you go.

637
00:26:19,145 --> 00:26:21,111
- I started working
on a backing track

638
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:22,279
that I was able to mess with.

639
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:23,281
- Cool.

640
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:26,350
- So it should be... good.

641
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,220
Supposed to be $500.

642
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:31,222
- What?

643
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:32,856
Oh, no, no, no, no.

644
00:26:32,858 --> 00:26:35,693
Julie told me that it was
supposed to be $300.

645
00:26:35,695 --> 00:26:39,029
- Eh... no, for a
finished demo, $500.

646
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:43,200
- No, I was told $300,
so I brought you $300.

647
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:45,069
- All right, I mean...

648
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:47,738
- Can you do it for $300?

649
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,740
Please?

650
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:51,008
- Please, please?

651
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,644
- I mean, my time
is super valuable.

652
00:26:53,646 --> 00:26:55,145
- Yeah.

653
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:56,847
Here's the thing, Julian.

654
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:58,849
I don't really have
any extra money right now.

655
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:01,051
I'm working a lot,
but I don't have much extra.

656
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:01,986
- Well, can you get it?

657
00:27:01,988 --> 00:27:03,120
I mean, I'll wait.

658
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:05,756
- I can't get it right now.

659
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:08,392
- Sorry.

660
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,766
- Please?

661
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:21,338
- Well, maybe we could
work something out.

662
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,040
- Oh, thank you so much.

663
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:24,675
- You can give me a blow job.

664
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:27,711
- No.

665
00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:29,413
- All right.

666
00:27:29,415 --> 00:27:30,948
- I can't.

667
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,850
My voice.

668
00:27:32,852 --> 00:27:35,853
Well, then... let me fuck you.

669
00:27:35,855 --> 00:27:37,388
- Oh, my god.

670
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,756
No.

671
00:27:38,758 --> 00:27:40,858
- Well, then, good-bye.

672
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,027
If you get the extra money,
you can come back.

673
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:44,029
You can get a sweet demo.

674
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,129
- For real?

675
00:27:45,131 --> 00:27:46,363
You want me to go, Julian?

676
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:47,865
You're gonna say no to $300?

677
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:48,966
That's a lot of money.

678
00:27:48,968 --> 00:27:50,401
- You're gonna say no to $200

679
00:27:50,403 --> 00:27:52,069
for a stupid blow job?

680
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:53,737
I mean, do the math.

681
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:54,972
It's a good deal.

682
00:27:54,974 --> 00:27:56,340
- You're a loser.

683
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:00,377
- Eviction from a public forum

684
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:05,315
is a violation and malprac...

685
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:08,218
Is representative
of an incompetent bitch

686
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,055
running amok.

687
00:28:12,758 --> 00:28:13,824
- Dad?

688
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:16,060
- Hey, pumpkin.

689
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:19,096
- Hey.
- How'd the recording go?

690
00:28:19,098 --> 00:28:20,764
- Oh, it was good.

691
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:22,099
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

692
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:23,233
- Good for you.

693
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:25,002
I'm so proud of you.

694
00:28:25,004 --> 00:28:26,937
When can I hear it?

695
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:28,706
- Oh, I'm not sure yet,

696
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:32,710
because, like, the guy, Julian,
has to mix it, so...

697
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:33,712
- Oh.

698
00:28:33,713 --> 00:28:34,745
- I don't know.

699
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:41,985
Um... Dad, like...

700
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:44,154
I heard that you went
to jail, or something?

701
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:45,456
- Oh, yeah.

702
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:46,458
Nothing to worry about.

703
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:47,758
Goddamn city council.

704
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,027
I'm gonna fix it.

705
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:52,496
Oh... Do you have plans tonight?

706
00:28:52,498 --> 00:28:54,031
You want to stick around
for dinner?

707
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:56,233
I was thinking
of ordering Chinese.

708
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,802
- I don't like Chinese food
in the summertime.

709
00:28:58,804 --> 00:29:00,204
- Pizza?

710
00:29:00,206 --> 00:29:02,506
- Dad, what do you mean
you're gonna fix it?

711
00:29:02,508 --> 00:29:07,044
- I'm gonna get them to stop
denying my civil rights.

712
00:29:07,046 --> 00:29:08,746
- Maybe you should, like,

713
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:10,848
chill out on these meetings
for a little bit, Dad.

714
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,449
- Well, why would I do that,
Katelyn?

715
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:14,785
- Because they get you super
upset and you turn into a...

716
00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:16,920
- I only get upset
when my common decent rights

717
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:19,890
are trying to be taken away
by a bunch of goddamn Nazis.

718
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:20,991
- Oh, my god, do you see?

719
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:22,025
- What?
Are you kidding me?

720
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:23,861
Look at these potholes!

721
00:29:23,863 --> 00:29:26,063
They never plowed our street
for a whole winter, not once.

722
00:29:26,065 --> 00:29:27,197
Ask Mrs. Capelli.

723
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,999
Ask anybody on our block!

724
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:31,034
I'm paying taxes for that.

725
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:32,102
It's wrong!

726
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,471
- Okay.

727
00:29:34,473 --> 00:29:35,906
It's wrong.

728
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,070
- Do you want to get pizza
tonight?

729
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,183
- I can't; I have dinner plans.

730
00:29:46,185 --> 00:29:47,351
- Maybe tomorrow?

731
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:52,222
- I'm going to Kanoga Lake.

732
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:55,160
But... love you.

733
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:56,293
- Love you too.

734
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:58,962
- Bye, Dad.

735
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,430
- Bye, honey.

736
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:02,833
Watch the pothole.

737
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:15,546
- "Yada, yada, yada.

738
00:30:15,548 --> 00:30:18,315
Ms. Casserta
is an incompetent bitch."

739
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:21,418
"Incompetent"
is misspelled, of course.

740
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,187
No, that's not the half of it.

741
00:30:23,189 --> 00:30:26,156
He calls me a... let's see...
A "dumb whore."

742
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:29,893
There's "fat," "ugly."

743
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:32,162
There's the "C" word.

744
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:33,397
No.

745
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:35,399
How many "C" words are there?

746
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:37,134
No, "cunt."

747
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:39,336
You know, I have had it
with this guy.

748
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,004
I really have.

749
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,008
- Ellen,
that's a great question.

750
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,010
Not, it really is.

751
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:47,177
I like that question a lot,

752
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:49,580
because I get asked it a lot.

753
00:30:49,582 --> 00:30:53,550
Let's see, it all began
when I was 8 years old

754
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:56,386
and I was grounded for sticking
a Barbie purse up my nose,

755
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:57,988
and I was doing that a lot,

756
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,356
so I think my parents
were a little worried

757
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:02,226
that I might have had a problem.

758
00:31:02,228 --> 00:31:04,428
So it was a weird time.

759
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:07,931
Anyway, we were all home.

760
00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:10,467
My parents were in the next room
watching the Yankees game,

761
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:12,102
and I was in my room.

762
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:14,137
And all of a sudden,

763
00:31:14,139 --> 00:31:16,073
somebody started singing
<i>God Bless America,</i>

764
00:31:16,075 --> 00:31:18,208
and I started singing along.

765
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,110
And my parents got quiet.

766
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:22,179
They were, like, silent.

767
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:24,948
And my mom goes,
"Is that Katelyn?"

768
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:27,117
My dad was like,
"Is that Katelyn?"

769
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:29,519
I mean, they were just
shocked and floored.

770
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:31,188
And I was excited.

771
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,350
I think they were excited.

772
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:34,992
It was just a really...

773
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:39,596
You fucking douchebag!

774
00:31:39,598 --> 00:31:43,267
That's fucking dangerous,
you piece of shit!

775
00:31:48,307 --> 00:31:49,473
- Wow, fuck you, douchebag.

776
00:31:49,475 --> 00:31:50,507
That was really dangerous.

777
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:52,409
- Damn, girl, take it easy.

778
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:55,946
Yo, so I heard you be doing a
demo with Julian for<i> The Voice.</i>

779
00:31:55,948 --> 00:31:57,014
- Yeah.

780
00:31:58,683 --> 00:31:59,683
And?

781
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:01,285
- That's dope.

782
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:03,420
Maybe I can be
on the same episode, you know?

783
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:05,355
- That's really funny, Cory.

784
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:07,124
What do you want to do on it?

785
00:32:07,126 --> 00:32:09,293
Like, I don't know,
be in charge of the recycling?

786
00:32:09,295 --> 00:32:11,094
- Spittin'.

787
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:13,130
Seriously, I'm the best rapper
out there right now.

788
00:32:13,132 --> 00:32:15,632
- Yeah, like you'll
ever be on TV.

789
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:17,534
- I can make it on TV, easy.

790
00:32:17,536 --> 00:32:19,169
- Whatever.

791
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:20,971
- Um, hey...

792
00:32:20,973 --> 00:32:24,274
Um... you want to go
to Kanoga Lake with me tomorrow?

793
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,543
It's gonna be a blowout.

794
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:27,978
- Like, maybe.

795
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,579
- You know,
I asked Shawna to go,

796
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:33,083
but she can't
'cause she's got to babysit.

797
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:34,351
- Wow.

798
00:32:34,353 --> 00:32:36,553
Fuck you, Cory.

799
00:32:37,957 --> 00:32:39,656
- Fuck you too, bitch!

800
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:42,492
- Ellen, I'm so sorry.

801
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:43,994
That was rude.

802
00:32:43,996 --> 00:32:45,963
Where were we?

803
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:47,431
Oh, right.

804
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:48,699
Was I always talented?

805
00:32:48,701 --> 00:32:50,334
Yeah, well, I don't really know

806
00:32:50,336 --> 00:32:52,602
how talented I was
when I was just born, right?

807
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:56,540
I mean, did you?

808
00:32:56,542 --> 00:33:00,043
But I always knew that I wanted
to get out of Liberty

809
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:01,712
and that I wanted to be famous.

810
00:33:01,714 --> 00:33:06,683
And, well... it was
kind of hard early on,

811
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:09,987
because my mom just
wasn't really around much.

812
00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:15,359
But my dad was so supportive...

813
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:19,629
and... encouraging and...

814
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,167
just a really...

815
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:27,771
good dad.

816
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:34,678
My dad is a really good dad.

817
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:42,085
- It's very frustrating to have
to talk about this again.

818
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:45,522
But I had a great idea to help
the unemployment problem.

819
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,624
This is a depressed county
we live in,

820
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:51,728
and I suggested many times
that we should get a...

821
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:54,264
I would like to register
a complaint

822
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:56,366
against Minelli's,
a restaurant that...

823
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:59,069
- Let's not start on that again.

824
00:33:59,071 --> 00:34:01,238
- Everyone in this town
is driving too fast,

825
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,639
and there are no posted signs

826
00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:04,608
that encourage people
to slow down.

827
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:05,776
- Time, Mr. Stuben.

828
00:34:05,778 --> 00:34:07,244
- There are a few stop signs...

829
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:14,117
I would like to talk about
the snowstorm from last week.

830
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,457
I'm having problems
on my street,

831
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:22,192
Boylston Street,

832
00:34:22,194 --> 00:34:25,796
because of
the St. Patrick's Day snowstorm,

833
00:34:25,798 --> 00:34:28,632
which my street
was never plowed.

834
00:34:28,634 --> 00:34:31,501
And I think that's farcical.

835
00:34:31,503 --> 00:34:34,505
And... I would like...
- Time, Mr. Stuben.

836
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:37,274
- My question is, why
wasn't my street...

837
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:39,776
- There is a reason
why we have these time limits.

838
00:34:43,082 --> 00:34:47,117
- And you can see here,
he's calm and non-threatening.

839
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,819
He's just a simple man.

840
00:34:48,821 --> 00:34:51,788
And what's happening
is that they're shining him on.

841
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,323
They're agitating him,

842
00:34:53,325 --> 00:34:55,859
trying to make him out
to be the bad guy.

843
00:34:55,861 --> 00:34:57,360
But it's not the case.

844
00:34:57,362 --> 00:34:59,129
And this continues.

845
00:34:59,131 --> 00:35:01,098
There's other videos,
and I will show them to you.

846
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,566
All he's doing
is seeking redress

847
00:35:02,568 --> 00:35:05,602
from his so-called
"elected government."

848
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:10,340
Yes, the floor
recognizes Larson.

849
00:35:10,342 --> 00:35:12,375
- Thank you.

850
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:15,579
I was just wondering
if I could get some more hummus.

851
00:35:15,581 --> 00:35:18,715
- Yeah, it's in the mini cooler,
under the table.

852
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:23,220
Anyway, what I want
you guys to understand

853
00:35:23,222 --> 00:35:25,689
is that the town
of Liberty, New York,

854
00:35:25,691 --> 00:35:29,159
has become Berlin under Hitler.

855
00:35:29,161 --> 00:35:31,361
What do we do?

856
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:33,296
I think this
is the perfect project

857
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:35,699
for Think Tank
to sort of take on.

858
00:35:35,701 --> 00:35:37,801
We've been looking
for a project in the region,

859
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:41,471
and I think Dave Stuben
is this project.

860
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:45,308
Yes, yes, the floor
recognizes Babatunde.

861
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,477
- What are you proposing
exactly?

862
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:50,847
And for the record,
I think he's a fascinating case.

863
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:52,349
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

864
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:53,416
Sure, sure, sure, sure,
sure, sure, sure.

865
00:35:53,418 --> 00:35:54,818
I think, at this stage,

866
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,286
what I'd like to do
is just start gathering,

867
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,821
you know,
the pertinent information.

868
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:59,623
Then we'll start sort of the,
like, the online,

869
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:01,791
you know, social media effort.

870
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:03,827
And when you combine that
with boots on the ground,

871
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:06,530
that's when the movement
starts to come together.

872
00:36:06,532 --> 00:36:08,565
Think Tank will be famous.

873
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:11,935
I can see this thing going viral
within, like, days, I guess.

874
00:36:11,937 --> 00:36:14,404
- So it looks like
we're all out of hummus.

875
00:36:14,406 --> 00:36:17,741
- Then bring more next time,
for yourself, I guess.

876
00:36:17,743 --> 00:36:19,643
Anyway...

877
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:22,746
- Do you want me to ask Kusha
to make some more galatke?

878
00:36:22,748 --> 00:36:25,415
- Sure, yes, whatever.

879
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:28,418
Anyway... this is our time.

880
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,753
- Yeah.

881
00:36:29,755 --> 00:36:32,622
- History will be forced
to move out of the way.

882
00:36:32,624 --> 00:36:34,558
What happens when that happens?

883
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,359
Someone steps in
to fill the vacuum.

884
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:37,594
History steps out of the way.

885
00:36:37,596 --> 00:36:41,198
We move in... to
replace history.

886
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,200
This is our time, gentlemen...

887
00:36:43,202 --> 00:36:44,434
and ladies...

888
00:36:44,436 --> 00:36:46,303
and, I mean, any other genders

889
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:47,938
that are in attendance.

890
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,506
This is the moment.

891
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:52,442
And I, for one, am ready
to pack up right now

892
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:55,345
and be ready to leave
as early as Friday.

893
00:36:55,347 --> 00:36:56,379
And what I want to know is...

894
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:58,248
- They're out of galatke.

895
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,584
Should I just call another
friend that I have who's Polish?

896
00:37:00,586 --> 00:37:03,253
- For the love of the devil,
Larson!

897
00:37:03,255 --> 00:37:05,722
Figure out the snacks
on your own time!

898
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:07,857
I am talking about history!

899
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:10,427
And those who will make it!

900
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:28,712
Banks got bailed out!

901
00:37:28,714 --> 00:37:31,715
We got sold out!

902
00:37:35,354 --> 00:37:37,354
- Today I would like
to register a complaint

903
00:37:37,356 --> 00:37:39,956
about the oak tree
that was cut down...

904
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:42,926
at the corner of Boylston...
- Time.

905
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:47,597
- And there are no posted signs

906
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:48,932
that encourage people
to slow down.

907
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:50,367
- Get up off the ground.

908
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:51,601
That's all I ask.

909
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,436
- Speedbumps or flashing yellows
or...

910
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:54,771
- Get up there with that lady,

911
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,640
that lady that stands
for liberty.

912
00:37:56,642 --> 00:37:59,009
- If you guys
responded to emails...

913
00:37:59,011 --> 00:38:00,811
- Take a look at this country
through her eyes

914
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:02,279
if you really want
to see something.

915
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:03,613
- Time.

916
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:05,315
- Let's get involved
and get active.

917
00:38:05,317 --> 00:38:08,018
- Dave, we will
have you arrested.

918
00:38:09,655 --> 00:38:11,621
- Why aren't citizens
in the neighborhood

919
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:14,057
asked about their concerns?

920
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:15,925
This is our city, our town,

921
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:18,728
and I would request,
if there are trees to be cut,

922
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:21,598
I would be happy
to be part of that committee

923
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,501
for recommendation or refusal.

924
00:38:24,503 --> 00:38:26,436
- The people in my state
need permanent relief

925
00:38:26,438 --> 00:38:27,871
from crooked men
riding their backs.

926
00:38:27,873 --> 00:38:29,873
- This is a depressed county
we live in,

927
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:31,741
and I suggested many times

928
00:38:31,743 --> 00:38:33,610
that we should get
a professional sports franchise.

929
00:38:33,612 --> 00:38:34,612
- Time, Mr. Stuben.

930
00:38:36,381 --> 00:38:38,048
- Minelli's eliminated
their Italian specialties menu,

931
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,416
specifically eliminating...

932
00:38:39,418 --> 00:38:40,617
- Thank you, Mr. Stuben.

933
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:42,319
- Which is the only item...

934
00:38:42,321 --> 00:38:45,889
- And the threat of aggression
by any group, anywhere,

935
00:38:45,891 --> 00:38:47,490
can no longer be tolerated.

936
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:49,426
- Because I have a voice,
and I have a vote!

937
00:38:49,428 --> 00:38:51,561
- Time, time.

938
00:38:51,563 --> 00:38:53,363
Time, Mr. Stuben.

939
00:38:53,365 --> 00:38:54,597
- This is America!

940
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:56,766
I demand three more minutes!

941
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:59,069
I request my rights
as a citizen!

942
00:38:59,071 --> 00:39:02,439
- Time, Mr. Stuben.

943
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:10,647
- I know not
what course others may take,

944
00:39:10,649 --> 00:39:12,782
but as for me...

945
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:16,753
give me liberty,
or give me death.

946
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:27,864
- We used to go out
with just my dad's .22.

947
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:31,368
It'd be me and James and Brant.

948
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:32,736
And we wouldn't even
let Brant shoot.

949
00:39:32,738 --> 00:39:33,837
- Hello, Rich.

950
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,004
- Oh, hey, look who it is,

951
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:36,673
Mr. Occupy Wall Street.

952
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:38,808
- I don't know about that.

953
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,043
- What happened?

954
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:41,644
- I was having
my civil rights denied,

955
00:39:41,646 --> 00:39:43,713
and I wasn't gonna
take it anymore.

956
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:46,516
- Well, looks like we got
Rosa Parks in here, huh?

957
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:49,786
- "I have a dream," right?

958
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:51,121
Old Dave has a dream

959
00:39:51,123 --> 00:39:53,823
to climb to the mountaintop

960
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:56,993
of city council equality!

961
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:58,728
- I don't think that's funny.

962
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:06,803
- All right, Dave, all right.

963
00:40:06,805 --> 00:40:08,905
It's okay.

964
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:11,074
- Chrissake, take it easy, Dave.

965
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:21,418
Um... Oh, I tell you...

966
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:25,155
I traded Shanahan
my Mossberg 535

967
00:40:25,157 --> 00:40:28,091
for his Bellini SuperNova.

968
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:35,031
- All right.

969
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:40,670
- Fuckin' sweet 12-gauge.

970
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:41,905
Pistol grip.

971
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:46,142
- Oh, yeah?

972
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:47,144
- Yeah.

973
00:40:47,145 --> 00:40:49,179
Well... see you later.

974
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:53,049
Bye, Oprah.

975
00:40:54,753 --> 00:40:55,985
Shit.

976
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:02,525
- See, the system
is counting on ignorance.

977
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:04,828
Ignorance is the wind
which fills the sails

978
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:07,597
of these malicious miscreants.

979
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,166
They've forced their way
into the driver's seat

980
00:41:10,168 --> 00:41:12,469
and are happily steering us

981
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:15,605
in this runaway train,
hurtling towards...

982
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:18,241
and ultimately off the cliff!

983
00:41:18,243 --> 00:41:21,010
We go begging to them
with our tail between our legs,

984
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:22,645
asking for the fairest of...

985
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:29,519
- Mr. Stuben.

986
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:35,024
Mr. Stuben... Dave Stuben.

987
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:36,960
- Yeah.

988
00:41:36,962 --> 00:41:37,962
- I'm Officer Lemke.

989
00:41:37,963 --> 00:41:39,529
This is Officer Blauser.

990
00:41:39,531 --> 00:41:40,830
Do you mind if we talk
to you for a minute?

991
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,499
- Yeah, I mind.

992
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:43,833
- It's about the threats
you've been making

993
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:45,001
to Ms. Christina Casserta.

994
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:46,035
- No, I didn't.

995
00:41:46,037 --> 00:41:47,971
And I know... I know my rights.

996
00:41:47,973 --> 00:41:49,639
I get a lawyer.

997
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:50,940
If you're gonna come
on my private property

998
00:41:50,942 --> 00:41:51,942
and try to arrest me...

999
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:53,276
- Take it easy, Mr. Stuben.

1000
00:41:53,278 --> 00:41:55,545
We're not here to arrest you.

1001
00:41:55,547 --> 00:41:56,547
- Okay.

1002
00:41:56,548 --> 00:41:57,914
Well, then, get off my property.

1003
00:41:57,916 --> 00:42:00,917
- Mr. Stuben, we just wanted
to let you know

1004
00:42:00,919 --> 00:42:02,652
that, even anonymously,

1005
00:42:02,654 --> 00:42:05,054
that online threats
made to a public figure

1006
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:08,124
are taken very seriously
at our department.

1007
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:10,026
- We're all aware
of your disruptive behavior

1008
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:12,061
at the last few
city council meetings.

1009
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:14,097
- You want to know
about disruptive behavior?

1010
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:15,565
How about you trying
to take away

1011
00:42:15,567 --> 00:42:17,901
my basic civil rights
as an American?

1012
00:42:17,903 --> 00:42:19,235
I'm getting harassed
by the government...

1013
00:42:19,237 --> 00:42:20,270
- Relax, relax.

1014
00:42:20,272 --> 00:42:21,304
- On my private property.

1015
00:42:21,306 --> 00:42:22,539
I'll call the FBI!

1016
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:24,040
I'll sue you and you!

1017
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,542
I'll sue you!

1018
00:42:25,544 --> 00:42:27,710
- Put that down.
- Calm down, Mr. Stuben.

1019
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:29,312
Calm down.

1020
00:42:29,314 --> 00:42:30,747
We just wanted to make you aware

1021
00:42:30,749 --> 00:42:33,216
of what the current situation
is.

1022
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:35,051
- You've been warned, Dave.

1023
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:49,299
You're gonna hear about this.

1024
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:51,868
Think Tank?

1025
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:53,036
What's this?

1026
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,241
YouTube.

1027
00:42:58,243 --> 00:43:00,343
What's on YouTube?

1028
00:43:12,691 --> 00:43:15,291
- Baby cakes, baby cakes!

1029
00:43:15,293 --> 00:43:16,926
Dave wants to meet with us.

1030
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:19,329
- Wha...
Dave?

1031
00:43:19,331 --> 00:43:22,031
- The poor guy from Upstate
who's being exploited.

1032
00:43:22,033 --> 00:43:23,333
- Oh, right.

1033
00:43:23,335 --> 00:43:25,234
- Yeah, he really wants us
to help him.

1034
00:43:25,236 --> 00:43:27,337
- So you're just gonna
drive Upstate

1035
00:43:27,339 --> 00:43:29,872
and do what now?

1036
00:43:29,874 --> 00:43:32,609
- Help him address
his grievances with the state.

1037
00:43:32,611 --> 00:43:33,876
We're gonna record him.

1038
00:43:33,878 --> 00:43:35,678
We're gonna, like,
take his message

1039
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,246
and everything about him;
we're gonna blast it out.

1040
00:43:37,248 --> 00:43:39,215
We're gonna blast
the fuck out of it.

1041
00:43:39,217 --> 00:43:40,750
- Donovan...

1042
00:43:40,752 --> 00:43:42,285
- It's about social justice,
babe.

1043
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:44,954
It's about taking on
state-sanctioned bullying.

1044
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:46,122
It's about censorship.

1045
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:47,857
- I'm pregnant.

1046
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:55,999
- What? But... Oh... oh, my god.

1047
00:43:56,001 --> 00:43:57,001
Oh, my god.

1048
00:43:57,002 --> 00:43:58,002
- No, I'm not; I'm not.

1049
00:43:58,003 --> 00:43:59,369
I just...

1050
00:43:59,371 --> 00:44:01,938
I really wanted
to be able to say that.

1051
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:02,872
- Maddy.

1052
00:44:02,874 --> 00:44:04,374
- But it was so dramatic, right?

1053
00:44:04,376 --> 00:44:05,908
- Maddy, focus, okay?

1054
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:07,210
This is really big
for Think Tank.

1055
00:44:07,212 --> 00:44:08,211
Everybody's gonna be there.

1056
00:44:08,213 --> 00:44:09,879
I mean, not everybody.

1057
00:44:09,881 --> 00:44:11,814
Obviously Gerald has
to take care of his cats.

1058
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:13,950
And I think Janelle
has to finish her documentary

1059
00:44:13,952 --> 00:44:15,852
on hopscotch that weekend.

1060
00:44:15,854 --> 00:44:17,787
And Harris has...

1061
00:44:17,789 --> 00:44:19,756
Harris can't do it
because Harris has to go

1062
00:44:19,758 --> 00:44:21,257
to a box kite convention.

1063
00:44:21,259 --> 00:44:22,992
But it's a pretty good
core group, I think.

1064
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:25,028
I think Cyrus is...
No, Cyrus is committed ro...

1065
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:26,963
- And you're gonna be back...

1066
00:44:26,965 --> 00:44:28,665
- We're gonna leave tomorrow.

1067
00:44:28,667 --> 00:44:29,866
We're gonna be back
in, like, one or two days.

1068
00:44:29,868 --> 00:44:31,334
- Okay.
- Three days, tops.

1069
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:32,735
- Okay.

1070
00:44:36,675 --> 00:44:39,409
- I was...
- Oh.

1071
00:44:39,411 --> 00:44:41,844
- Whatever, whatever.

1072
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:42,846
- Baby.

1073
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:43,880
- It's fine.

1074
00:44:43,882 --> 00:44:44,882
You know, it's fine.

1075
00:44:44,883 --> 00:44:46,382
You should just go.

1076
00:44:46,384 --> 00:44:47,384
- Okay.

1077
00:44:47,385 --> 00:44:48,885
- Kay.

1078
00:44:48,887 --> 00:44:50,119
- I'll try to check in
every hour.

1079
00:44:50,121 --> 00:44:52,255
- Okay.

1080
00:44:52,257 --> 00:44:53,990
- Bye-ee.

1081
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:03,166
- Oh, my god, that's adorable.

1082
00:45:03,168 --> 00:45:06,836
Oh, it's, like, the perfect size
for a city sidewalk.

1083
00:45:06,838 --> 00:45:09,005
It's so cute.

1084
00:45:09,007 --> 00:45:11,140
So fucking cute.

1085
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:15,078
- See?

1086
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:19,182
She's getting her own show now.

1087
00:45:19,184 --> 00:45:20,483
- I know.

1088
00:45:20,485 --> 00:45:21,818
She's such a whore.

1089
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,920
- She didn't even do anything.

1090
00:45:23,922 --> 00:45:25,354
- She auditioned.

1091
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:29,125
- Wait, you have to audition
to be on<i> Teen Mom?</i>

1092
00:45:29,127 --> 00:45:31,194
- I guess, right?

1093
00:45:31,196 --> 00:45:32,862
- I guess.

1094
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:37,934
Do you think they got pregnant
first or second

1095
00:45:37,936 --> 00:45:39,335
when they auditioned?

1096
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:44,073
- I don't know.

1097
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:45,808
- I don't know either.

1098
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,016
She's getting
her own nail polish line,

1099
00:45:54,018 --> 00:45:56,853
and she's gonna be on<i> Ellen.</i>

1100
00:45:56,855 --> 00:45:58,855
- That's just what happens
when you're on<i> Teen Mom,</i>

1101
00:45:58,857 --> 00:46:01,924
which only came from being
in a sex tape that went viral.

1102
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:06,195
God, she's, like...
double lucky.

1103
00:46:06,197 --> 00:46:09,398
- Fucking viral videos?

1104
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,936
I have more talent than she has
in her little fingers combined.

1105
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:15,905
- You mean you have more talent

1106
00:46:15,907 --> 00:46:18,908
in your little finger
than she does?

1107
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:20,543
- Yeah, combined.

1108
00:46:20,545 --> 00:46:21,844
That's what I said.

1109
00:46:21,846 --> 00:46:23,780
- No, you said, like,

1110
00:46:23,782 --> 00:46:27,316
"I've got more talent than all
of her little fingers combined."

1111
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:43,032
- I should be famous.

1112
00:46:43,034 --> 00:46:44,801
- Whoo!

1113
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:17,533
- Who the fuck is this guy?

1114
00:47:17,535 --> 00:47:19,268
- Yo, hey, man.

1115
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:21,204
- Yo.

1116
00:47:21,206 --> 00:47:23,072
- What you doing?

1117
00:47:23,074 --> 00:47:24,106
- Nothing.

1118
00:47:24,108 --> 00:47:25,107
I'm getting ready to peel.

1119
00:47:25,109 --> 00:47:27,443
Shit's getting wack.

1120
00:47:27,445 --> 00:47:28,911
- What are you talking about,
man?

1121
00:47:28,913 --> 00:47:30,479
Why?

1122
00:47:30,481 --> 00:47:32,481
The nitrous guy's gonna be here
in, like, two seconds.

1123
00:47:32,483 --> 00:47:33,916
- Aw, fuck that shit.

1124
00:47:33,918 --> 00:47:35,518
- Suit yourself, dude.

1125
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,186
You've been dragging around
all night.

1126
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:38,188
What's up with you?

1127
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:40,623
- Nothing.

1128
00:47:40,625 --> 00:47:43,059
- No, that's not nothing, man.

1129
00:47:43,061 --> 00:47:45,494
You're pissed off
because fuckin' Katelyn

1130
00:47:45,496 --> 00:47:48,297
is eating the shit
out of Cody's face right now.

1131
00:47:48,299 --> 00:47:49,932
- What?
Nigga, please.

1132
00:47:49,934 --> 00:47:52,101
I just got mad allergies,
is all.

1133
00:47:52,103 --> 00:47:54,136
- Oh, yeah,
fuckin' allergies, man.

1134
00:47:54,138 --> 00:47:55,605
I thought you were
off her, dude.

1135
00:47:55,607 --> 00:47:57,874
- Yeah, man,
I don't give a fuck.

1136
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:03,246
- Plus fuck him.

1137
00:48:03,248 --> 00:48:05,948
Fuck him for what he's
been posting, you know?

1138
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:07,884
- Wait, what the fuck's
he been posting?

1139
00:48:07,886 --> 00:48:09,452
- You know, posting shit
on Facebook.

1140
00:48:09,454 --> 00:48:11,587
- Yeah?

1141
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:13,656
- Yeah, man.

1142
00:48:13,658 --> 00:48:15,424
He said something about, like,

1143
00:48:15,426 --> 00:48:17,426
this rapping faggot-tard

1144
00:48:17,428 --> 00:48:20,129
who's, like,
making a fool of himself.

1145
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:21,131
- Oh, yeah?

1146
00:48:21,132 --> 00:48:22,431
- Oh, yeah, man.

1147
00:48:22,433 --> 00:48:24,267
You didn't see that shit
on Facebook?

1148
00:48:24,269 --> 00:48:26,435
Dude, for sure.

1149
00:48:26,437 --> 00:48:29,672
Man, I'm not saying
it was about you,

1150
00:48:29,674 --> 00:48:31,107
but probably was.

1151
00:48:31,109 --> 00:48:33,609
- Yeah, that's right.

1152
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:35,912
- That is right, dude.

1153
00:48:35,914 --> 00:48:38,080
Don't let him get away
with that shit, dude.

1154
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:39,382
You know what I'm saying?

1155
00:48:39,384 --> 00:48:40,516
- I'll fuck
that little bitch up.

1156
00:48:40,518 --> 00:48:41,584
- Yeah, exa... right?

1157
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:42,586
Cody's a fuckin' punk.

1158
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:43,653
- He's a little bitch.

1159
00:48:43,655 --> 00:48:45,221
You think I can't rap, huh?

1160
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:48,324
Nigga, please!

1161
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:52,461
Yo, bitch.

1162
00:48:52,463 --> 00:48:54,297
- Cory, what the hell
are you doing?

1163
00:48:54,299 --> 00:48:55,665
- I ain't talking to you, bitch.

1164
00:48:55,667 --> 00:48:57,233
I'm talking to this bitch
right here.

1165
00:48:57,235 --> 00:48:58,267
- Fuck'd you say?

1166
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:00,403
- You heard me, little bitch.

1167
00:49:00,405 --> 00:49:02,104
I'll fuck you up.

1168
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,107
You think I'm a faggot?

1169
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:06,542
You 'bout to gag it.

1170
00:49:06,544 --> 00:49:08,945
I'll dick-slap you.

1171
00:49:08,947 --> 00:49:11,280
I'll... dick-slap you.

1172
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:12,682
I'll dick-slap you

1173
00:49:12,684 --> 00:49:14,483
till your pops turn blue.

1174
00:49:14,485 --> 00:49:16,152
Blue balls, that is.

1175
00:49:16,154 --> 00:49:19,021
Then I'ma take a whiz.

1176
00:49:20,158 --> 00:49:21,958
You think you got nuts?

1177
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,426
You think you got nuts?

1178
00:49:23,428 --> 00:49:25,227
Don't make me bust a gut.

1179
00:49:25,229 --> 00:49:27,430
These nuts are king.

1180
00:49:27,432 --> 00:49:29,598
These nuts... Ah!

1181
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,233
You hit me in the nuts!

1182
00:49:31,235 --> 00:49:32,501
You faggot!

1183
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:45,214
- It's like a game to me
when you run.

1184
00:49:45,216 --> 00:49:46,449
It's like a game!

1185
00:49:46,451 --> 00:49:48,084
This is my party now.

1186
00:49:48,086 --> 00:49:49,452
- Everybody stay put.

1187
00:49:49,454 --> 00:49:51,520
- I'll tase every last one
of you mother...

1188
00:49:51,522 --> 00:49:53,155
Turn the fucking hip-hop off!

1189
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:54,991
- You know you're not
supposed to be out here.

1190
00:49:54,993 --> 00:49:56,993
- You, come here.

1191
00:49:56,995 --> 00:49:58,160
Turn that off.

1192
00:49:58,162 --> 00:49:59,528
The switch right there.

1193
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:00,596
Is that it?
Is that it?

1194
00:50:00,598 --> 00:50:01,630
You're not even pressing it.

1195
00:50:01,632 --> 00:50:02,632
Throw you in that fire!

1196
00:50:02,633 --> 00:50:03,666
I swear to God.

1197
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:05,568
- Jeff, it's all right.

1198
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:07,636
- I smell weed, man.

1199
00:50:07,638 --> 00:50:10,039
- Jeff.

1200
00:50:10,041 --> 00:50:13,142
- That's a perfectly good
end table in that fire, Mark!

1201
00:50:13,144 --> 00:50:14,243
- Oh, god!

1202
00:50:14,245 --> 00:50:15,245
Mommy!
Mom!

1203
00:50:15,246 --> 00:50:16,612
- What the fuck is that?

1204
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:21,384
- Come on, man!

1205
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,121
- Jesus, Larson.

1206
00:50:25,123 --> 00:50:27,223
It's barely a 2 1/2 hour drive.

1207
00:50:27,225 --> 00:50:29,125
- Well, you never know.

1208
00:50:29,127 --> 00:50:30,426
- Yeah, we're not going
on, like,

1209
00:50:30,428 --> 00:50:32,294
a vision quest or something.

1210
00:50:32,296 --> 00:50:35,765
- Well, you'll be thanking me
if something happens,

1211
00:50:35,767 --> 00:50:38,267
if we break down or there's hail
or something like that.

1212
00:50:38,269 --> 00:50:39,335
- Hail?

1213
00:50:39,337 --> 00:50:40,337
- Yeah, hail.

1214
00:50:40,338 --> 00:50:43,172
Like, really bad hail.

1215
00:50:43,174 --> 00:50:44,174
It happens.

1216
00:50:44,175 --> 00:50:46,042
- Yeah, uh-huh.

1217
00:50:46,044 --> 00:50:48,477
Guys, I motion for a road trip.

1218
00:50:48,479 --> 00:50:50,713
Road trip!

1219
00:50:53,284 --> 00:50:55,117
- Ugh, I hate this song.

1220
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:57,286
Can you turn the station?

1221
00:50:57,288 --> 00:51:00,089
Oh, man, you got to see
this video Azir just sent me.

1222
00:51:00,091 --> 00:51:01,424
- Oh,
the "punched in the nuts" kid?

1223
00:51:01,426 --> 00:51:02,426
- Yes.

1224
00:51:02,427 --> 00:51:03,427
- I saw that.

1225
00:51:03,428 --> 00:51:05,261
- I'll tweet it to you guys.

1226
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:08,164
- You think you got nuts?

1227
00:51:08,166 --> 00:51:09,765
Don't make me bust a gut.

1228
00:51:09,767 --> 00:51:12,368
Ah!

1229
00:51:13,504 --> 00:51:14,703
- Oh!

1230
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:24,246
You think you got nuts?

1231
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:25,748
Don't make me bust a gut.

1232
00:51:27,618 --> 00:51:29,718
You hit me in the nuts!

1233
00:51:36,694 --> 00:51:38,427
- I wish it was even longer.
- This is really funny.

1234
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,229
- What are you guys laughing at?

1235
00:51:40,231 --> 00:51:41,263
- Look!

1236
00:51:43,568 --> 00:51:45,134
- You serious?

1237
00:51:45,136 --> 00:51:46,669
- It's got, like,
a million hits already.

1238
00:51:46,671 --> 00:51:47,803
- Yeah, and I kind of
started it.

1239
00:51:47,805 --> 00:51:49,238
- Oh, please.

1240
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:50,306
- It doesn't have
a million hits.

1241
00:51:50,308 --> 00:51:51,640
- It probably will soon.

1242
00:51:51,642 --> 00:51:53,375
- No, no, I was fucking with him
on purpose,

1243
00:51:53,377 --> 00:51:54,643
trying to get him
to fight with him.

1244
00:51:54,645 --> 00:51:55,711
- Cory's famous.

1245
00:51:55,713 --> 00:51:56,712
- I know, can you believe it?

1246
00:51:56,714 --> 00:51:58,147
- I was goading him on.

1247
00:51:58,149 --> 00:51:59,315
You know, I was the goat
in that story.

1248
00:51:59,317 --> 00:52:00,416
- I bet he'll get on<i> Tosh.0.</i>

1249
00:52:00,418 --> 00:52:01,417
And then they'll fly him out.

1250
00:52:01,419 --> 00:52:02,818
They do that whole thing

1251
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:04,253
where they fly out
the people from the video,

1252
00:52:04,255 --> 00:52:05,354
and then they re-create the...

1253
00:52:05,356 --> 00:52:07,756
- Famous for what?
Hmm?

1254
00:52:09,193 --> 00:52:10,593
For getting slapped
in the balls?

1255
00:52:10,595 --> 00:52:11,694
- Hey.

1256
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:15,598
- What's up her ass?

1257
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,500
- Rotate the beers.

1258
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,139
- Do we have everything?
- Yeah.

1259
00:52:23,141 --> 00:52:24,707
- We got the hoodies?
- They're in the trunk.

1260
00:52:24,709 --> 00:52:27,209
- And I also got falafel chips,
just in case.

1261
00:52:27,211 --> 00:52:29,345
- Jesus Christ, Larson.

1262
00:52:29,347 --> 00:52:30,579
- Oh, this is 16, this is it.

1263
00:52:31,883 --> 00:52:33,449
- Oh, my god,
that's the pothole.

1264
00:52:33,451 --> 00:52:35,551
- Wow.

1265
00:52:35,553 --> 00:52:37,386
- All right, this is it.

1266
00:52:37,388 --> 00:52:38,388
- Oh, wow.

1267
00:52:38,389 --> 00:52:39,421
- Should I get his mail?

1268
00:52:39,423 --> 00:52:40,556
- Uh, maybe.

1269
00:52:40,558 --> 00:52:41,690
- No, no, that's stupid.

1270
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:49,932
- Hi.

1271
00:52:49,934 --> 00:52:51,534
Mr. Stuben.

1272
00:52:51,536 --> 00:52:53,536
Hi, I'm Donovan McAfree.

1273
00:52:53,538 --> 00:52:55,404
This is Larson Tudor.

1274
00:52:55,406 --> 00:52:57,940
And this is Babatunde.

1275
00:52:57,942 --> 00:53:01,544
Um... we're Think Tank.

1276
00:53:01,546 --> 00:53:03,812
We're the guys who emailed you
from New York City.

1277
00:53:03,814 --> 00:53:04,880
- Yeah, hello.

1278
00:53:04,882 --> 00:53:05,882
- Hi.
- Hi.

1279
00:53:05,883 --> 00:53:07,583
- Hello.

1280
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:13,589
- Uh, can we come in?

1281
00:53:13,591 --> 00:53:14,857
- Yeah, sure.

1282
00:53:14,859 --> 00:53:16,292
- Awesome.

1283
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:19,528
- All right.

1284
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:24,767
- Oh, wow.

1285
00:53:24,769 --> 00:53:25,968
This is the nerve center.

1286
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:27,570
- Oh, Mr. Stuben.

1287
00:53:27,572 --> 00:53:29,405
- You guys see if I had
any mail out there?

1288
00:53:29,407 --> 00:53:30,606
- Fuck!

1289
00:53:30,608 --> 00:53:32,241
Sorry, sorry.

1290
00:53:32,243 --> 00:53:34,243
I just... I need to start
listening to my instincts.

1291
00:53:34,245 --> 00:53:35,744
Yes, you do have some;
let me go get it for you.

1292
00:53:35,746 --> 00:53:37,546
- Larson?
- Yeah.

1293
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:38,948
- Babatunde, could you guys
get the stuff from the car,

1294
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:40,382
I think, and bring it in?

1295
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:41,850
- Great idea.
- Great idea.

1296
00:53:41,852 --> 00:53:43,953
- Awesome, awesome.
This is good; this is good.

1297
00:53:43,955 --> 00:53:46,488
Dave, first order of business,

1298
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:48,757
can you direct me the loo?

1299
00:53:48,759 --> 00:53:49,759
- What?

1300
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,461
- The WC.

1301
00:53:52,463 --> 00:53:56,765
Um... if one wanted to find,
like, a comfort house?

1302
00:53:56,767 --> 00:53:58,000
Or, like, a camp station?

1303
00:53:58,002 --> 00:54:01,604
Would you... Do
you have a Biffy?

1304
00:54:01,606 --> 00:54:04,473
- These are fucking delicious.

1305
00:54:04,475 --> 00:54:06,475
- So, Larson, I think
if we get the camera set up,

1306
00:54:06,477 --> 00:54:07,643
we could start
interviewing Dave.

1307
00:54:07,645 --> 00:54:08,711
- Okay.
- Great.

1308
00:54:08,713 --> 00:54:10,412
And while you're doing that,

1309
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:11,914
I'll go ahead
and I'll start the Kickstarter.

1310
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:13,682
I'll start the Indiegogo,
a GoFundMe account.

1311
00:54:13,684 --> 00:54:15,551
Babatunde, I'm gonna
send you a link.

1312
00:54:15,553 --> 00:54:16,986
I'd love it if you'd
just send it everywhere, okay?

1313
00:54:16,988 --> 00:54:18,354
- Sure, sure.

1314
00:54:18,356 --> 00:54:19,555
- Like, Gawker,
send it to Reddit,

1315
00:54:19,557 --> 00:54:20,689
send it to BoingBoing.

1316
00:54:20,691 --> 00:54:21,691
- Okay, yeah.

1317
00:54:21,692 --> 00:54:23,025
- Make sure it goes...

1318
00:54:23,027 --> 00:54:24,460
- Huffington Post?
- HuffPo, definitely.

1319
00:54:24,462 --> 00:54:25,561
Yes, especially
the comments section.

1320
00:54:25,563 --> 00:54:27,296
- Daily Coast?

1321
00:54:27,298 --> 00:54:28,430
- Daily Coast, but only
if it's an off-topic forum.

1322
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:29,798
Same goes for Politico.

1323
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:37,673
- Actually, if you could use
your anonymous Reddit account,

1324
00:54:37,675 --> 00:54:40,509
I have five fake Reddit accounts
that I could use to up-vote it.

1325
00:54:40,511 --> 00:54:41,877
- Um, hi?

1326
00:54:41,879 --> 00:54:43,045
Hi.

1327
00:54:43,047 --> 00:54:44,913
- You must be Katelyn.

1328
00:54:46,584 --> 00:54:48,017
- Dad?

1329
00:54:48,019 --> 00:54:49,418
- Don't be scared;
we're here to help.

1330
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:50,619
- Dad.
- Hey, honey.

1331
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:52,021
- Dad, what the fuck
is going on?

1332
00:54:52,023 --> 00:54:53,656
- Oh, these boys,
they're gonna help me

1333
00:54:53,658 --> 00:54:56,458
get justice
with the town council.

1334
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,526
- What?
- Yeah.

1335
00:54:57,528 --> 00:54:58,827
They're from New York City.

1336
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:00,029
Apparently there's
a video online

1337
00:55:00,031 --> 00:55:01,597
from the council meeting
the other night,

1338
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:02,831
and all sorts of people

1339
00:55:02,833 --> 00:55:04,566
are starting to rally
behind my cause.

1340
00:55:04,568 --> 00:55:07,636
- Yeah, your dad is about to be
the most famous man in town.

1341
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:09,805
- Try the state.
- Mm-hmm.

1342
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:11,740
- The state.

1343
00:55:11,742 --> 00:55:14,877
- Your father is, like, a symbol
for something that's going on,

1344
00:55:14,879 --> 00:55:17,346
like, something big,
something worldwide and local.

1345
00:55:17,348 --> 00:55:20,816
And it's about infrastructure,
and it's about people.

1346
00:55:23,387 --> 00:55:25,087
- Katelyn.

1347
00:55:25,089 --> 00:55:27,022
Katelyn!

1348
00:55:27,024 --> 00:55:29,658
- That was a great Vine.

1349
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:30,793
Yeah.

1350
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:34,797
Hashtag "real moment."

1351
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:37,032
- Oh, my god.

1352
00:55:37,034 --> 00:55:38,954
These documents
are incriminating.

1353
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:09,865
- I want to record this demo.

1354
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:10,899
- Okay, you got $500?

1355
00:56:10,901 --> 00:56:12,034
- No, I have $300.

1356
00:56:12,036 --> 00:56:13,068
- Well, then...

1357
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:14,837
- I will give you a hand job,

1358
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:16,739
but I won't blow you,
and I will not let you fuck me.

1359
00:56:16,741 --> 00:56:17,973
Take it or leave it.

1360
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:22,144
- Okay.

1361
00:56:24,682 --> 00:56:26,715
Just sit on the couch.

1362
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:41,864
- What up, Eminem?

1363
00:56:41,866 --> 00:56:42,931
- Fuck you.

1364
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:46,135
- Rapping idiot gets pwned.

1365
00:56:46,137 --> 00:56:47,636
- Why don't you come over here

1366
00:56:47,638 --> 00:56:49,758
and say that to my face,
you little faggot?

1367
00:56:50,941 --> 00:56:52,074
Yeah.

1368
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:10,759
- Hang on, sometimes
it takes a few minutes.

1369
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:12,194
- Okay, you don't have
a few minutes,

1370
00:57:12,196 --> 00:57:15,697
so you better fucking hurry up,
you piece of shit.

1371
00:57:15,699 --> 00:57:19,568
- Well, if I don't come,
you can't record.

1372
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:21,570
That's fair.

1373
00:57:36,753 --> 00:57:39,621
- Fucking come, douchebag!

1374
00:57:39,623 --> 00:57:41,190
What is taking you so long?

1375
00:57:41,192 --> 00:57:43,859
- I... I don't know.

1376
00:57:43,861 --> 00:57:45,561
I guess I'm not gonna come.

1377
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:48,864
- Okay, then what
am I supposed to do

1378
00:57:48,866 --> 00:57:50,532
if you're not gonna come?

1379
00:57:50,534 --> 00:57:53,135
- Well, if I don't come,
you can't record.

1380
00:57:53,137 --> 00:57:54,137
That's the deal.

1381
00:57:54,138 --> 00:57:55,471
Sorry.

1382
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:01,243
- Fine, okay.
Fine.

1383
00:58:01,245 --> 00:58:04,880
Just... Just get a condom,

1384
00:58:04,882 --> 00:58:08,617
and don't even think
about kissing me.

1385
00:58:08,619 --> 00:58:09,885
And make it fast.

1386
00:58:09,887 --> 00:58:11,019
- Yeah.

1387
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:17,092
- Oh, my god.

1388
00:58:22,866 --> 00:58:24,199
- Okay.

1389
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:32,140
- Hey.

1390
00:58:32,142 --> 00:58:33,142
Don't just stand there.

1391
00:58:33,143 --> 00:58:34,977
Go pick that shit up.

1392
00:58:34,979 --> 00:58:36,645
God.

1393
00:59:12,015 --> 00:59:14,016
- Hey, let's go, come on,
back to work.

1394
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:19,788
You want to do this
next weekend too?

1395
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:22,157
First, you show your junk
in public, and...

1396
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:23,559
Hey.

1397
00:59:23,561 --> 00:59:25,127
I'm talking to you.

1398
00:59:35,004 --> 00:59:36,939
Looking fine, brother.

1399
00:59:44,948 --> 00:59:47,282
Yeah, ooh.

1400
00:59:47,284 --> 00:59:49,351
I bet he's got nice abs.

1401
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:52,821
Lift your shirt up, man.

1402
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:58,193
- Oh, god.

1403
00:59:58,195 --> 00:59:59,761
Oh.

1404
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:01,163
Okay.

1405
01:00:01,165 --> 01:00:02,931
See, that wasn't so bad, right?

1406
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:06,702
- Where's your bathroom?

1407
01:00:06,704 --> 01:00:10,072
- Uh... it's right back...

1408
01:00:10,074 --> 01:00:12,074
I'll just start
setting everything up.

1409
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:20,782
- We need way less Drambuie.

1410
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:23,018
- Check it out, you guys.

1411
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:24,886
America's next
top number one idol.

1412
01:00:24,888 --> 01:00:26,822
- You got the demo?
- Oh, cool!

1413
01:00:26,824 --> 01:00:27,824
Right.

1414
01:00:29,193 --> 01:00:30,258
Oh, my god,
you're gonna love it.

1415
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:31,326
I'm so excited.

1416
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:34,129
I'm so excited.

1417
01:00:56,787 --> 01:00:58,086
- Professional.

1418
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:01,056
Professionally done.

1419
01:01:01,058 --> 01:01:03,058
- Yeah,
you can totally tell that.

1420
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:04,060
- You can?

1421
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:07,429
Worth it.
Worth it.

1422
01:01:07,431 --> 01:01:08,964
- Good.

1423
01:01:08,966 --> 01:01:10,365
- So that's...

1424
01:01:10,367 --> 01:01:12,067
Is that, like, the final thing?
That's it?

1425
01:01:12,069 --> 01:01:13,435
- Yeah, well, I mean,
she can still make changes.

1426
01:01:13,437 --> 01:01:14,936
It's like a process, you know?

1427
01:01:14,938 --> 01:01:16,071
You do it over;
you send it back and fo...

1428
01:01:16,073 --> 01:01:17,073
- Yeah, no, it's done.

1429
01:01:17,074 --> 01:01:18,074
- Oh.

1430
01:01:18,075 --> 01:01:19,075
- But if you wanted to,

1431
01:01:19,076 --> 01:01:20,308
like, you could still tweak it.

1432
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:21,343
- Why would I want to tweak it?

1433
01:01:21,345 --> 01:01:23,178
I think it's great.

1434
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:24,913
I mean, do you think that
there's something wrong with it?

1435
01:01:24,915 --> 01:01:27,949
- No, I just was thinking,

1436
01:01:27,951 --> 01:01:29,851
like, you could just
keep making it better,

1437
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:32,688
and then if you wanted to,

1438
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:34,256
you could, like...

1439
01:01:34,258 --> 01:01:37,292
- Bring the vocals down
just a tiny bit, you know?

1440
01:01:37,294 --> 01:01:40,362
And then maybe pitch it up,
add some bass to it.

1441
01:01:40,364 --> 01:01:41,964
- Bass.
- You know.

1442
01:01:41,965 --> 01:01:43,131
And then before you
turn it in to<i> The Voice,</i>

1443
01:01:43,133 --> 01:01:44,332
you could, you know...

1444
01:01:44,334 --> 01:01:46,001
- Well, I think it's perfect.

1445
01:01:46,003 --> 01:01:47,302
- Oh, okay.

1446
01:01:47,304 --> 01:01:50,305
- And I overnighted a copy
to them already.

1447
01:01:50,307 --> 01:01:51,473
Fingers crossed.

1448
01:01:51,475 --> 01:01:52,475
- Okay.

1449
01:01:52,476 --> 01:01:53,476
- That's awesome.

1450
01:01:53,477 --> 01:01:54,477
I'm so proud of you.

1451
01:01:54,478 --> 01:01:56,011
- Thanks.

1452
01:01:56,013 --> 01:01:57,746
- Good luck.

1453
01:01:57,748 --> 01:01:59,381
- What's that supposed to mean?

1454
01:01:59,383 --> 01:02:01,083
- Nothing, it means good luck.

1455
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:04,953
- You guys, I'm so excited!

1456
01:02:04,955 --> 01:02:08,090
I just feel so good to know
that this is gonna happen.

1457
01:02:08,092 --> 01:02:09,391
- Just... you know, never know

1458
01:02:09,393 --> 01:02:11,159
what the criteria is,
that's all.

1459
01:02:11,161 --> 01:02:13,361
- Oh, I've actually seen
every episode of<i> The Voice.</i>

1460
01:02:13,363 --> 01:02:14,796
I know what they're
looking for, and...

1461
01:02:14,798 --> 01:02:16,865
oh, my god, Crystal,
some of the shit

1462
01:02:16,867 --> 01:02:18,300
that they put on there,
it's terrible.

1463
01:02:18,302 --> 01:02:19,367
- I'm just saying,
you never know.

1464
01:02:19,369 --> 01:02:20,369
That's all.

1465
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:21,937
- I do.
- No, you don't.

1466
01:02:21,939 --> 01:02:23,405
There might be
a million different reasons

1467
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:25,040
they take one person
over the next, just never know.

1468
01:02:25,042 --> 01:02:26,408
- Oh, my god, Crystal.
- What?

1469
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:28,043
That's just the reality
of the situation.

1470
01:02:28,045 --> 01:02:29,444
That's how these shows work.

1471
01:02:29,446 --> 01:02:31,179
- Please, Crystal.

1472
01:02:31,181 --> 01:02:34,116
I hate to bring this up,
because I know it's a sore spot.

1473
01:02:34,118 --> 01:02:36,852
But you lost<i> Junior Star Search</i>
like, a hundred years ago.

1474
01:02:36,854 --> 01:02:38,353
And then someone like me
with talent

1475
01:02:38,355 --> 01:02:39,988
that's young and pretty
comes around,

1476
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:41,356
and I'm sure it's hard,

1477
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:42,824
and I'm sure
you're kind of jelly,

1478
01:02:42,826 --> 01:02:44,926
but... what?

1479
01:02:44,928 --> 01:02:46,895
Why did you look at her
like that?

1480
01:02:46,897 --> 01:02:50,332
- What?
- I saw that look you gave her.

1481
01:02:50,334 --> 01:02:53,335
I don't need
to be condescended to, okay?

1482
01:02:53,337 --> 01:02:54,936
- I didn't.

1483
01:02:54,938 --> 01:02:56,104
- Fuck you, Julie.

1484
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:57,873
- I didn't.
- Fuck you.

1485
01:02:57,875 --> 01:02:59,274
I saw that look you gave.

1486
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:00,542
I saw it.

1487
01:03:00,544 --> 01:03:02,144
- Listen, she's just
trying to help.

1488
01:03:02,146 --> 01:03:04,246
- Oh, and fuck you very much,
too, Crystal.

1489
01:03:04,248 --> 01:03:07,115
I just think it's really sad
how you sit around

1490
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:09,384
and, like, try to bring me down

1491
01:03:09,386 --> 01:03:11,987
to make yourself feel better
because you were such a failure.

1492
01:03:11,989 --> 01:03:13,321
Okay?

1493
01:03:13,323 --> 01:03:14,856
You're sad to me.

1494
01:03:14,858 --> 01:03:16,892
You're really sad.

1495
01:03:16,894 --> 01:03:19,094
I hope I never get
old and bitter like you.

1496
01:03:22,265 --> 01:03:24,099
- You're out
of your fucking mind.

1497
01:03:24,101 --> 01:03:25,534
You are so naive.

1498
01:03:25,536 --> 01:03:27,169
You think you have
a chance in hell

1499
01:03:27,171 --> 01:03:28,336
of getting on<i> The Voice?</i>

1500
01:03:28,338 --> 01:03:29,404
Do you?

1501
01:03:29,406 --> 01:03:31,973
That's never gonna happen.

1502
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:34,876
Katelyn, you can't sing.

1503
01:03:34,878 --> 01:03:36,244
You cannot sing.

1504
01:03:36,246 --> 01:03:37,579
You're never gonna get
on<i> The Voice,</i>

1505
01:03:37,581 --> 01:03:39,881
not in a million years, okay?

1506
01:03:39,883 --> 01:03:42,484
You need to face the facts.

1507
01:03:42,486 --> 01:03:44,553
- Wow.

1508
01:03:44,555 --> 01:03:46,054
Super sad.

1509
01:03:47,924 --> 01:03:49,391
Really pitiful.

1510
01:03:58,067 --> 01:04:00,468
Ellen, you're totally right.

1511
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:03,004
It's just... You're
just so right.

1512
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:04,406
You have to battle the haters.

1513
01:04:04,408 --> 01:04:07,409
I mean, to quote my favorite
Kelly Clarkson song,

1514
01:04:07,411 --> 01:04:10,011
"What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger."

1515
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:12,247
I will say, though,

1516
01:04:12,249 --> 01:04:14,916
I think growing up
in this small, simple...

1517
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:22,891
Leave me alone.

1518
01:04:22,893 --> 01:04:25,994
I think growing up in this...

1519
01:04:25,996 --> 01:04:27,863
You know, in a very small town

1520
01:04:27,865 --> 01:04:29,965
with a bunch of sad people

1521
01:04:29,967 --> 01:04:33,168
made me the star
that I am today.

1522
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:34,636
And just, like, they...

1523
01:04:34,638 --> 01:04:36,171
They're just the kind of people

1524
01:04:36,173 --> 01:04:39,941
that don't understand talent,
and...

1525
01:04:39,943 --> 01:04:41,276
Aw, thank you.

1526
01:04:41,278 --> 01:04:42,278
Thank you, I know.

1527
01:04:42,279 --> 01:04:43,612
Now they see it,

1528
01:04:43,614 --> 01:04:45,614
like, along with the rest
of the world.

1529
01:04:46,016 --> 01:04:48,283
But, you know...

1530
01:04:50,419 --> 01:04:52,087
- This is serious, okay?

1531
01:04:52,089 --> 01:04:54,623
So I guess you and Julian
had sex or something?

1532
01:04:54,625 --> 01:04:57,225
Did you know that he recorded it
on his phone?

1533
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:58,526
I mean, I don't know
if that's true or not,

1534
01:04:58,528 --> 01:04:59,995
but that's what Christian said.

1535
01:04:59,997 --> 01:05:01,463
And Julian's an asshole.

1536
01:05:01,465 --> 01:05:04,199
He'll share it
with, like, everybody.

1537
01:05:04,201 --> 01:05:05,400
I'm really sorry about earlier,

1538
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:07,202
but you have to call me back,
okay?

1539
01:05:07,204 --> 01:05:08,570
I love you, bye.

1540
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,341
- Dave is so good.
- Yeah?

1541
01:05:13,343 --> 01:05:15,310
- He's just real.

1542
01:05:15,312 --> 01:05:18,146
Just everything about him
is just resonating as "common,"

1543
01:05:18,148 --> 01:05:19,447
and that's exactly what we need.

1544
01:05:19,449 --> 01:05:20,949
I think this
is really great for us.

1545
01:05:20,951 --> 01:05:23,551
I mean, this is, like...
- Mm-hmm.

1546
01:05:23,553 --> 01:05:25,553
- I think this is really gonna
put Think Tank on the map.

1547
01:05:25,555 --> 01:05:26,955
- Oh.

1548
01:05:26,957 --> 01:05:28,390
- I just put the link up
the other night,

1549
01:05:28,392 --> 01:05:30,125
and it's already getting
a ton of hits.

1550
01:05:30,127 --> 01:05:32,294
People are, like,
reposting it everywhere.

1551
01:05:32,296 --> 01:05:33,328
- Wow.

1552
01:05:33,330 --> 01:05:34,530
And when are you coming back?

1553
01:05:34,531 --> 01:05:36,031
- Well, we will
definitely be here

1554
01:05:36,033 --> 01:05:37,365
at least two more days,

1555
01:05:37,367 --> 01:05:38,633
because the next council meeting
is Tuesday.

1556
01:05:38,635 --> 01:05:39,635
- Huh.

1557
01:05:39,636 --> 01:05:41,336
- Ooh, I miss you!

1558
01:05:41,338 --> 01:05:42,570
- Yeah, you too.

1559
01:05:42,572 --> 01:05:46,107
- Well, um, just come up
if you can.

1560
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:47,208
- I can do that.

1561
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:49,644
- All right, bye.
- Bye.

1562
01:05:49,646 --> 01:05:53,248
- And I would please
like to have

1563
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:58,153
the oatmeal and raisins,
<i>s'il vous plait.</i>

1564
01:05:58,155 --> 01:05:59,721
- Sure, I'll be right back
with your coffee.

1565
01:05:59,723 --> 01:06:01,323
- Gracias.
- Raisins.

1566
01:06:01,325 --> 01:06:02,325
- Thank you,<i> au revoir.</i>

1567
01:06:02,326 --> 01:06:04,259
- Raisins.
- Raisins.

1568
01:06:04,261 --> 01:06:06,461
Oh, I love your shirt.

1569
01:06:08,731 --> 01:06:10,365
- What?
- Your shirt.

1570
01:06:10,367 --> 01:06:12,067
I love it; it's great.

1571
01:06:12,069 --> 01:06:13,168
- Oh, thanks.

1572
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:14,602
- Funny.

1573
01:06:14,604 --> 01:06:16,237
If we're gonna push this
on Instagram...

1574
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:17,272
- What?

1575
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:21,343
- Oh, your shirt, it's funny.

1576
01:06:21,345 --> 01:06:24,112
It's great; it's a great shirt.

1577
01:06:24,114 --> 01:06:25,347
- How's it funny?

1578
01:06:27,216 --> 01:06:32,153
- I mean, it's... you know...
- No.

1579
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:35,590
I don't know.

1580
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:39,427
- Um... I didn't mean

1581
01:06:39,429 --> 01:06:41,563
that it was funny like,

1582
01:06:41,565 --> 01:06:44,232
"Hahahaha, look at you," at all.

1583
01:06:44,234 --> 01:06:46,368
I mean funny like,
"Ooh, that's odd," you know?

1584
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:48,403
Not, like, abnormal
in any way, at all.

1585
01:06:48,405 --> 01:06:50,071
Like, of course not.

1586
01:06:50,073 --> 01:06:51,539
Like, if anything,
it's, like, extra normal.

1587
01:06:51,541 --> 01:06:53,608
That's a normal shirt,
hyper-normal shirt.

1588
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:55,477
- Rich, come on, just sit down.

1589
01:06:55,479 --> 01:06:57,679
- You know, I wouldn't even
think "funny" is the right word.

1590
01:06:57,681 --> 01:06:59,114
I think "fun."
Just think "fun."

1591
01:06:59,116 --> 01:07:00,281
It's a fun shirt.

1592
01:07:00,283 --> 01:07:01,716
It's a fun, normal shirt.

1593
01:07:03,285 --> 01:07:04,519
It's a normal, fun shirt.

1594
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:06,187
Just fun and normal.

1595
01:07:08,457 --> 01:07:10,658
- It's all right.

1596
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:13,294
- Fun shirt.

1597
01:07:13,296 --> 01:07:16,264
So, anyway, I was... - Oh, man.

1598
01:07:16,266 --> 01:07:19,034
- So if we push this out
on, like Pinterest...

1599
01:07:19,036 --> 01:07:20,168
- I got to have that shirt.

1600
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:21,536
Sir.

1601
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:22,637
- Larson, Larson, Larson.

1602
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:23,639
- Hey, man.

1603
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,540
Bro, where'd you get it?

1604
01:07:26,742 --> 01:07:28,209
- Did you just touch me?

1605
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:29,511
- Where'd you get the shirt?

1606
01:07:29,513 --> 01:07:31,046
- Larson, Larson.

1607
01:07:31,048 --> 01:07:33,048
- I got it at "don't touch me."

1608
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:34,115
- I really like it.

1609
01:07:34,117 --> 01:07:35,417
- Sir, thank you
for your answer.

1610
01:07:35,419 --> 01:07:37,352
- I got a buddy
who would love that shirt.

1611
01:07:37,354 --> 01:07:38,520
You know, Bran.

1612
01:07:38,522 --> 01:07:40,055
He started Grindr.

1613
01:07:40,057 --> 01:07:41,089
He would love that.

1614
01:07:41,091 --> 01:07:42,091
- Yeah.

1615
01:07:42,092 --> 01:07:43,558
- Wait, what?

1616
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:44,793
- We're very sorry.
- We're very sorry.

1617
01:07:44,795 --> 01:07:46,528
- Okay, they apologized.

1618
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:48,329
- I like her shirt too.

1619
01:07:48,331 --> 01:07:49,364
- That's enough.

1620
01:07:49,366 --> 01:07:50,366
Let's go.

1621
01:07:50,367 --> 01:07:52,300
Let it go.

1622
01:07:52,302 --> 01:07:53,701
- Do you remember
if they had mediums?

1623
01:07:53,703 --> 01:07:55,837
- Oh, my god.

1624
01:07:55,839 --> 01:07:58,106
- Because coconut milk
has nutrients.

1625
01:07:58,108 --> 01:07:59,507
Soy is filled with estrogen.

1626
01:07:59,509 --> 01:08:01,142
- It's not filled with estrogen!

1627
01:08:01,144 --> 01:08:02,343
- Yes it is!
- Guys!

1628
01:08:02,345 --> 01:08:03,511
- If you drink soy milk
for a year,

1629
01:08:03,513 --> 01:08:04,646
you're gonna grow breasts.

1630
01:08:04,648 --> 01:08:06,181
- I drink soy milk all the time!

1631
01:08:06,183 --> 01:08:07,782
- I think you guys
have carried over

1632
01:08:07,784 --> 01:08:11,119
some of that hostile energy from
the restaurant into the car.

1633
01:08:11,121 --> 01:08:13,354
What the hell is this?

1634
01:08:13,356 --> 01:08:16,191
- Piquing state-wide interest
in one man's fight

1635
01:08:16,193 --> 01:08:17,826
for rectitude and justice,

1636
01:08:17,828 --> 01:08:20,395
which has led to a tremendous
outpouring of support

1637
01:08:20,397 --> 01:08:23,198
due to an internet video
that has gone viral.

1638
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,100
And now 45-year-old Dave Stuben

1639
01:08:25,102 --> 01:08:27,669
finds himself a bit
of a local celebrity.

1640
01:08:27,671 --> 01:08:30,472
We sent our Action News 2
Action News 2 Action Crew

1641
01:08:30,474 --> 01:08:33,141
to Monticello to find out more.

1642
01:08:33,143 --> 01:08:34,576
- If there are trees to be cut,

1643
01:08:34,578 --> 01:08:37,445
I would be happy to be part
of that committee,

1644
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:39,180
for recommendation or refusal.

1645
01:08:39,182 --> 01:08:40,648
- Um, hi, yeah.

1646
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:42,517
Dave?

1647
01:08:42,519 --> 01:08:43,651
Dave?

1648
01:08:43,653 --> 01:08:45,220
Where's Dave?

1649
01:08:45,222 --> 01:08:46,888
- You must be Donovan.

1650
01:08:46,890 --> 01:08:48,756
- I'm Marshal.

1651
01:08:48,758 --> 01:08:50,859
- Hi, yeah,
what's going on here?

1652
01:08:50,861 --> 01:08:52,360
- We saw your video.

1653
01:08:52,362 --> 01:08:54,429
It is fuckin' brills,
by the way.

1654
01:08:54,431 --> 01:08:57,132
And, well, we decided
to come up and help out.

1655
01:08:57,134 --> 01:08:59,868
- Oh, yeah, well, we've kind of
got it taken care of, so...

1656
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:01,369
- Oh, my god.

1657
01:09:01,371 --> 01:09:04,439
Your video is brill, so good.

1658
01:09:04,441 --> 01:09:05,373
- I already said that.

1659
01:09:05,375 --> 01:09:06,708
Also, "brill" is my word.

1660
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:07,842
We talked about that.

1661
01:09:07,844 --> 01:09:09,677
- Thank you.

1662
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:12,313
- We're Brain Box,
a collective out of Brooklyn.

1663
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:14,382
- Oh, that's what we do.
- Oh.

1664
01:09:14,384 --> 01:09:16,684
- Yeah, we're Think Tank
out of Greenpoint, so...

1665
01:09:16,686 --> 01:09:17,852
- Oh.

1666
01:09:17,854 --> 01:09:19,521
We're out of Bushwick.

1667
01:09:21,457 --> 01:09:25,660
- Donovan, there's something
that you need to see.

1668
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:31,599
- So you consider it
really an injustice.

1669
01:09:31,601 --> 01:09:34,636
- There is no justice
in this town, none.

1670
01:09:34,638 --> 01:09:36,304
- And what did you do about it?

1671
01:09:36,306 --> 01:09:38,907
- Well, I wrote a letter
to the federal attorney general,

1672
01:09:38,909 --> 01:09:42,510
the ACLU,
the state attorney general,

1673
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:44,179
and the River Reporter.

1674
01:09:44,181 --> 01:09:45,680
- And what kind of response
did you get?

1675
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:47,182
- And I saved them all.

1676
01:09:47,184 --> 01:09:48,383
They're all on file.

1677
01:09:48,385 --> 01:09:49,584
I save everything.

1678
01:09:49,586 --> 01:09:50,685
All the letters,
I have them on file.

1679
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:51,886
- Psst, Dave.

1680
01:09:51,888 --> 01:09:53,221
- For your own protection,
right?

1681
01:09:53,223 --> 01:09:54,556
- Yes, for my own protection.

1682
01:09:54,558 --> 01:09:56,118
- And what kind of response
did you get?

1683
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:57,560
- Hey, hey, guy.

1684
01:09:57,561 --> 01:09:59,894
Do you mind?

1685
01:09:59,896 --> 01:10:01,829
- Sorry.

1686
01:10:01,831 --> 01:10:04,432
David, can I talk to you
for a second?

1687
01:10:04,434 --> 01:10:06,474
- Oh, they're interviewing me,
Donovan.

1688
01:10:09,305 --> 01:10:11,239
- Let me ask you that again.

1689
01:10:11,241 --> 01:10:12,707
What kind of response
did you get?

1690
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:14,375
- Nothing.

1691
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:15,810
- All right, secret meeting
in the Zipcar... now.

1692
01:10:15,812 --> 01:10:18,379
- ...not respect people
who vote them into office.

1693
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:19,681
- Yeah.
- All of them.

1694
01:10:19,683 --> 01:10:20,715
- The concerned citizen.

1695
01:10:20,717 --> 01:10:21,983
You've... you've...

1696
01:10:21,985 --> 01:10:23,518
You're frustrated by the system.

1697
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:24,852
- Yeah, there is no system.

1698
01:10:24,854 --> 01:10:26,921
This is the United States
of Russia.

1699
01:10:26,923 --> 01:10:28,556
- I have an interview
set up with Dave.

1700
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:29,924
- Oh, great, yeah,
my cousin works at Buzzfeed.

1701
01:10:29,926 --> 01:10:31,392
- This is gonna put
Thought Manifesto

1702
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:32,827
on the map, dudes.

1703
01:10:34,763 --> 01:10:38,233
- The car recognizes Larson.

1704
01:10:38,235 --> 01:10:41,803
- Is it possible to make
any kind of legal claim

1705
01:10:41,805 --> 01:10:43,271
on Dave's image?

1706
01:10:43,273 --> 01:10:45,741
Like, can we... - No, no.

1707
01:10:45,742 --> 01:10:47,308
I don't think so at all.

1708
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:48,676
I don't think that'll work,
sorry.

1709
01:10:48,678 --> 01:10:50,545
I was hoping to save this
for Tuesday

1710
01:10:50,547 --> 01:10:52,347
when we had momentum
on our side,

1711
01:10:52,349 --> 01:10:55,817
but I think the time has come...

1712
01:10:55,819 --> 01:10:57,018
for the hoodies.

1713
01:10:57,020 --> 01:10:58,553
- Are you serious?

1714
01:10:58,555 --> 01:10:59,854
It seems like we said

1715
01:10:59,856 --> 01:11:01,456
the hoodies were gonna be
a Tuesday thing.

1716
01:11:01,458 --> 01:11:03,691
That's a really big step
we're making.

1717
01:11:03,693 --> 01:11:05,994
- A big step is exactly
what we need right now.

1718
01:11:05,996 --> 01:11:07,428
- I'm just saying...

1719
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:09,397
- There is critically
little time

1720
01:11:09,399 --> 01:11:11,499
for discussion,
for argument right now.

1721
01:11:11,501 --> 01:11:13,434
- There's critical little time.

1722
01:11:13,436 --> 01:11:14,602
- There's critically
little time.

1723
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:15,703
- Critical little, I think.

1724
01:11:15,705 --> 01:11:16,938
- It's an adverb modifying...

1725
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:18,673
- I think you would
agree with me

1726
01:11:18,675 --> 01:11:20,608
that it's critical little,
not critically little.

1727
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:22,043
- Critically little.

1728
01:11:22,045 --> 01:11:23,511
- I don't mean to be critical
at this moment.

1729
01:11:23,513 --> 01:11:24,979
- There is little time.

1730
01:11:24,981 --> 01:11:26,414
There is critical little time,
is... doesn't...

1731
01:11:26,416 --> 01:11:27,782
- Critically, there is
little time.

1732
01:11:27,784 --> 01:11:29,584
- Then "critical"
doesn't modify "little."

1733
01:11:29,586 --> 01:11:31,052
- Literally, if we don't...

1734
01:11:31,054 --> 01:11:32,987
- The time critically;
it's the littleness.

1735
01:11:32,989 --> 01:11:34,756
- You're getting
very angry right now.

1736
01:11:34,758 --> 01:11:37,592
- The gentleman is out of order.

1737
01:11:37,594 --> 01:11:40,995
The gentleman will obey
the rules of the car.

1738
01:11:42,364 --> 01:11:43,731
- Sorry, fine, fine.

1739
01:11:43,733 --> 01:11:46,434
- The floor... the car
recognizes Babatunde.

1740
01:11:46,436 --> 01:11:48,469
- Thank you.
- Fuck.

1741
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:49,904
- Thank you.

1742
01:11:49,906 --> 01:11:51,439
- No, he said the car
recognizes Babatunde.

1743
01:11:51,441 --> 01:11:52,774
- Babatunde,
you are out of order.

1744
01:11:52,776 --> 01:11:54,876
- You just...
- Babatunde, you are recognized.

1745
01:11:54,878 --> 01:11:56,678
- Thank you.
I'm just saying...

1746
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,446
- The floor recognizes Larson.

1747
01:11:58,448 --> 01:12:02,383
- Donovan, I am 100%
behind the hoodies.

1748
01:12:02,385 --> 01:12:05,420
I also want to just suggest
a muffin.

1749
01:12:05,422 --> 01:12:06,554
- You're out of order.

1750
01:12:06,556 --> 01:12:07,556
- How?

1751
01:12:07,557 --> 01:12:08,690
- Lars...
- I'm sorry.

1752
01:12:08,692 --> 01:12:09,692
- Is there any way...

1753
01:12:09,693 --> 01:12:10,725
- Larson is out of order.

1754
01:12:10,727 --> 01:12:11,726
- Is there any way that we can...

1755
01:12:11,728 --> 01:12:12,860
- Babatunde is out of order.

1756
01:12:12,862 --> 01:12:14,362
- I am raising my hand, sir.

1757
01:12:14,364 --> 01:12:15,530
- You are raising your voice,

1758
01:12:15,532 --> 01:12:16,597
and you are out of order.

1759
01:12:16,599 --> 01:12:17,965
- You're raising your voice.

1760
01:12:17,967 --> 01:12:19,867
There's a lot of negative energy
right now.

1761
01:12:19,869 --> 01:12:22,937
- The car recognizes
a valid point for Baba...

1762
01:12:22,939 --> 01:12:25,807
- Oh!
No!

1763
01:12:25,809 --> 01:12:26,809
No!

1764
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:28,810
Stop it!
Stop it!

1765
01:12:30,713 --> 01:12:32,880
Let's just get
the fucking hoodies.

1766
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:36,617
- Dave?

1767
01:12:36,619 --> 01:12:38,052
We got you a hoodie.

1768
01:12:38,054 --> 01:12:39,821
- Are you looking
for the guy who lives here?

1769
01:12:39,823 --> 01:12:41,456
- Um, yes, Dave.

1770
01:12:41,458 --> 01:12:44,792
- They took him into town
to get a mani-pedi.

1771
01:12:44,794 --> 01:12:49,097
Hey, by the way, amazing video.

1772
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:52,700
- Let's go back
to the motor lodge.

1773
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:54,068
We need to regroup.

1774
01:12:56,138 --> 01:12:58,573
Comrades, we have 48 hours

1775
01:12:58,575 --> 01:13:00,675
until Dave Stuben
addresses the world.

1776
01:13:00,677 --> 01:13:01,876
What say you?

1777
01:13:03,579 --> 01:13:04,912
- I could go
for a veggie burger.

1778
01:13:04,914 --> 01:13:06,781
- Does this place get HBO?

1779
01:13:06,783 --> 01:13:08,416
- You guys!

1780
01:13:08,418 --> 01:13:09,817
We have things to do.

1781
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:14,455
- Katelyn!

1782
01:13:14,457 --> 01:13:17,125
Katelyn, come on,
it's been two fucking days!

1783
01:13:19,595 --> 01:13:20,595
Katelyn!

1784
01:13:20,597 --> 01:13:22,430
I'm serious.

1785
01:13:22,432 --> 01:13:24,752
If you don't answer the door,
I'm gonna call the cops.

1786
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:34,041
- Our Buzzfeed article...

1787
01:13:44,853 --> 01:13:47,688
- Who are you people?

1788
01:13:47,690 --> 01:13:48,723
Dad!

1789
01:13:48,725 --> 01:13:49,991
- Hey, you must be Katelyn.

1790
01:13:49,993 --> 01:13:51,159
- What the fuck is going on?

1791
01:13:51,161 --> 01:13:52,527
- What?
- What's happening?

1792
01:13:52,529 --> 01:13:53,961
- Oh, your dad's in town.

1793
01:13:53,963 --> 01:13:54,963
He's getting outfitted.

1794
01:13:54,964 --> 01:13:55,964
- Why?

1795
01:13:55,965 --> 01:13:57,498
Why is the news here?

1796
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:58,900
- Because of your dad.

1797
01:13:58,902 --> 01:14:00,635
They're doing a story on him.

1798
01:14:00,637 --> 01:14:01,702
And us.

1799
01:14:01,704 --> 01:14:03,538
- And who are you people?

1800
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:05,139
- Well, I don't presume
to speak for everybody.

1801
01:14:05,141 --> 01:14:06,674
But I'm with Brain Box.

1802
01:14:06,676 --> 01:14:09,710
We're an advocacy group
out of Brooklyn.

1803
01:14:09,712 --> 01:14:13,548
- Okay, look,
I don't know what that is.

1804
01:14:13,550 --> 01:14:16,150
My dad isn't really
equipped for this, okay?

1805
01:14:16,152 --> 01:14:18,519
He, like, doesn't have
the personality.

1806
01:14:18,521 --> 01:14:19,687
He's a little off.

1807
01:14:19,689 --> 01:14:21,189
Do you understand that?

1808
01:14:21,191 --> 01:14:23,024
- I know,
but that's why we're here.

1809
01:14:23,026 --> 01:14:24,559
He needs us.

1810
01:14:26,595 --> 01:14:27,895
We're here to help.

1811
01:14:32,067 --> 01:14:34,035
- This is insanity.

1812
01:14:38,106 --> 01:14:39,240
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1813
01:14:39,242 --> 01:14:40,975
Guns are not the answer.

1814
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:43,211
This isn't about you, asshole.

1815
01:15:12,876 --> 01:15:13,941
- My bong!

1816
01:15:13,943 --> 01:15:15,142
Oh.

1817
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:19,780
Dude, did you break something?

1818
01:15:19,782 --> 01:15:20,982
Who are you?

1819
01:15:20,984 --> 01:15:22,283
- I'm Cory Janike...

1820
01:15:22,285 --> 01:15:24,285
Motherfuckin' C-to-the-Y!

1821
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:25,287
- Huh?

1822
01:15:25,288 --> 01:15:26,954
- Oh, I know you.

1823
01:15:26,956 --> 01:15:28,756
- Bitch.
- Dude.

1824
01:15:28,758 --> 01:15:30,992
- I heard you had a sex tape
of you and Katelyn Stuben.

1825
01:15:30,994 --> 01:15:33,027
- Um, no.

1826
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:34,029
- Bullshit!

1827
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:35,229
I know you do.

1828
01:15:35,231 --> 01:15:36,564
Christian Snyder
said you told him,

1829
01:15:36,566 --> 01:15:38,065
and you were gonna show him.

1830
01:15:38,067 --> 01:15:41,536
- Okay, are you her boyfriend
or something, or...

1831
01:15:41,538 --> 01:15:42,570
- Where is it?

1832
01:15:42,572 --> 01:15:43,971
- Okay, dude, it was nothing.

1833
01:15:43,973 --> 01:15:45,706
What the fuck
do you care anyway?

1834
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:47,108
Jesus Christ, man!

1835
01:15:47,110 --> 01:15:48,709
All right, all right,
all right, I have it!

1836
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:49,877
All right, it's on my phone!

1837
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:50,879
Look.

1838
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,647
Fuck, dude.

1839
01:15:55,017 --> 01:15:56,017
- Katelyn!

1840
01:15:56,019 --> 01:15:57,652
- Of course.

1841
01:15:57,654 --> 01:15:59,220
You fucking creeps.

1842
01:15:59,222 --> 01:16:00,222
- Whoa, wait.

1843
01:16:00,223 --> 01:16:01,689
I was coming to save you.

1844
01:16:01,691 --> 01:16:03,591
I mean, get this
from this asshole.

1845
01:16:03,593 --> 01:16:04,659
Erase it, I mean!

1846
01:16:04,661 --> 01:16:06,093
- Cory, shut up!

1847
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:08,729
Give me the hammer.

1848
01:16:08,731 --> 01:16:09,797
- He was, actually.

1849
01:16:09,799 --> 01:16:10,831
That is what he was gonna...

1850
01:16:10,833 --> 01:16:12,833
- Give me the fucking hammer.

1851
01:16:12,835 --> 01:16:15,136
- Okay, shh.

1852
01:16:15,138 --> 01:16:17,298
What's up with your pops
and the city council?

1853
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:24,779
- I can help with your pops,
for reals.

1854
01:16:25,847 --> 01:16:27,214
I love you.

1855
01:16:35,223 --> 01:16:36,757
- Who else has this?

1856
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:37,959
Who else has this?

1857
01:16:37,961 --> 01:16:39,627
- No one, no one.

1858
01:16:39,629 --> 01:16:42,630
I swear I'm telling the truth.

1859
01:16:42,632 --> 01:16:43,998
No one.

1860
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,233
- You better be fucking
telling me the truth,

1861
01:16:46,235 --> 01:16:47,735
you piece of shit.

1862
01:16:47,737 --> 01:16:49,036
- I am.

1863
01:16:58,347 --> 01:16:59,747
- Give me your phone.

1864
01:16:59,749 --> 01:17:00,915
- Why?

1865
01:17:00,917 --> 01:17:02,016
- Give me your phone, Cory!

1866
01:17:02,018 --> 01:17:03,084
I'll shoot you in the dick.

1867
01:17:03,086 --> 01:17:04,086
- Okay, shit.

1868
01:17:04,087 --> 01:17:05,052
It's not even on there.

1869
01:17:05,054 --> 01:17:06,988
Holy shit.

1870
01:17:06,990 --> 01:17:08,723
Okay, shit.

1871
01:17:16,031 --> 01:17:18,299
Yo, what the... Oh,
what the fuck!

1872
01:17:18,301 --> 01:17:19,301
- Ugh!

1873
01:17:25,941 --> 01:17:27,775
I hate you.

1874
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:32,146
- What the fuck, man?

1875
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:33,247
- I hate you!

1876
01:17:34,683 --> 01:17:36,017
Katelyn!

1877
01:17:36,019 --> 01:17:38,252
Katelyn, I was
telling you the truth.

1878
01:17:38,254 --> 01:17:40,021
Katelyn, I was trying
to get rid of it.

1879
01:17:40,023 --> 01:17:41,288
I'm serious!

1880
01:17:42,825 --> 01:17:44,158
Katelyn!

1881
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:45,160
Fuck!

1882
01:17:53,035 --> 01:17:54,201
- Really?

1883
01:17:54,203 --> 01:17:56,437
Not even one car?

1884
01:17:56,439 --> 01:17:59,006
I'm just afraid
it's gonna get chaotic.

1885
01:17:59,008 --> 01:18:02,109
You know, screaming
and who knows what.

1886
01:18:02,111 --> 01:18:04,145
Well, I don't know what else
to do, Tom, okay?

1887
01:18:04,147 --> 01:18:06,747
You know, there's news crews.

1888
01:18:06,749 --> 01:18:07,948
There's these web people.

1889
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:09,250
It's crazy.

1890
01:18:09,252 --> 01:18:11,252
There's press
all over this thing.

1891
01:18:11,254 --> 01:18:12,787
Yeah, you've seen it.

1892
01:18:12,789 --> 01:18:14,121
National.

1893
01:18:15,757 --> 01:18:17,058
All right.

1894
01:18:19,394 --> 01:18:21,195
Megyn!

1895
01:18:21,197 --> 01:18:22,997
- Ma'am.

1896
01:18:22,999 --> 01:18:24,298
- Get on the phone, call.

1897
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:26,333
Get me some extra security
for tonight.

1898
01:18:26,335 --> 01:18:27,735
- You want guns?

1899
01:18:27,737 --> 01:18:29,170
- What?
No, people.

1900
01:18:29,172 --> 01:18:31,439
Security people, guards,
whatever they're called.

1901
01:18:31,441 --> 01:18:33,708
Call, get me some extra
for tonight.

1902
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:34,875
- Yes, ma'am.

1903
01:18:34,877 --> 01:18:37,211
- Oh, Megyn.
- Yes, ma'am.

1904
01:18:37,213 --> 01:18:39,413
- Call that Tour de Force
nail salon.

1905
01:18:39,415 --> 01:18:40,481
Make me an appointment.

1906
01:18:40,483 --> 01:18:41,749
- Ma'am?

1907
01:18:41,751 --> 01:18:43,784
- CNN is coming.

1908
01:18:43,786 --> 01:18:45,419
I want to look presentable.

1909
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:17,384
- He should be here any minute.

1910
01:19:17,386 --> 01:19:19,453
Be ready.

1911
01:19:19,455 --> 01:19:21,355
- Hi, I'm Katelyn Stuben.

1912
01:19:21,357 --> 01:19:23,023
- Hi.

1913
01:19:23,025 --> 01:19:24,358
- I'm Dave's daughter.

1914
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:25,860
- Hm?

1915
01:19:25,862 --> 01:19:27,795
- Dave, his daughter.

1916
01:19:27,797 --> 01:19:29,530
You know, the guy
that all this is for?

1917
01:19:29,532 --> 01:19:30,532
I'm his daughter.

1918
01:19:30,533 --> 01:19:31,533
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1919
01:19:31,534 --> 01:19:32,867
- He's quite a man.

1920
01:19:32,869 --> 01:19:34,502
- Yes, he is.

1921
01:19:34,504 --> 01:19:36,804
- Oh, thank you so much for
letting us intrude like this.

1922
01:19:36,806 --> 01:19:39,907
- Oh, my gosh,
no problem at all.

1923
01:19:48,016 --> 01:19:50,417
I was an only child.

1924
01:19:50,419 --> 01:19:53,053
I don't have any siblings.

1925
01:19:53,055 --> 01:19:55,956
So... I'm not a reporter,

1926
01:19:55,958 --> 01:19:57,391
but I've watched the news a bit,

1927
01:19:57,393 --> 01:19:59,126
and I think
that's a great story.

1928
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:01,128
- Oh... yeah.

1929
01:20:04,332 --> 01:20:06,433
- Can I help you guys
with anything?

1930
01:20:06,435 --> 01:20:08,335
- Oh, no, that's all right.

1931
01:20:11,006 --> 01:20:13,107
- Like an interview or anything?

1932
01:20:13,109 --> 01:20:14,308
- No.

1933
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:16,377
Thanks.

1934
01:20:16,379 --> 01:20:18,345
Oh, this is him.

1935
01:20:18,347 --> 01:20:20,047
- Hey, there he is!

1936
01:20:22,385 --> 01:20:23,450
- Dad?

1937
01:20:25,086 --> 01:20:27,087
- Dave!
- Dave!

1938
01:20:27,089 --> 01:20:28,856
- Dave, how was the dump, Dave?

1939
01:20:28,858 --> 01:20:30,457
- Uh, okay.

1940
01:20:30,459 --> 01:20:34,328
- Dave, how's it feel
to be a part of this movement?

1941
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:35,596
- Dad?

1942
01:20:36,999 --> 01:20:38,098
Dad.

1943
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:39,233
- Oh, hey, honey.

1944
01:20:39,235 --> 01:20:40,601
- Hey, Dave?

1945
01:20:40,603 --> 01:20:42,336
I need to talk to you.

1946
01:20:42,338 --> 01:20:44,238
I have a few ideas I want
to run by you for tonight.

1947
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:46,006
- Dad.

1948
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:47,842
- And the... we need to talk
to you about your outfit, okay?

1949
01:20:47,844 --> 01:20:49,043
- Dad.
- And your mustache.

1950
01:20:49,045 --> 01:20:50,045
- Dad?

1951
01:21:47,202 --> 01:21:55,109
- The acronym would
be O.T.T.S.T.D...

1952
01:21:55,111 --> 01:21:57,544
D.D.T.I.

1953
01:21:57,546 --> 01:21:59,246
- It's too long of a hashtag.

1954
01:21:59,248 --> 01:22:01,048
- I'm thinking
of forward slashing it.

1955
01:22:01,050 --> 01:22:02,449
- Well, fuck, we'll do both.

1956
01:22:02,451 --> 01:22:04,285
- Operation Think Tank
Saves the Day,

1957
01:22:04,287 --> 01:22:06,654
Dave's Day, That Is.

1958
01:22:06,656 --> 01:22:08,022
Perfect.

1959
01:22:08,024 --> 01:22:09,456
- Haters gonna hate.

1960
01:22:09,458 --> 01:22:10,658
Players gonna play.

1961
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:12,059
Make the universe sit up.

1962
01:22:12,061 --> 01:22:13,193
Tonight they gonna pay.

1963
01:22:13,195 --> 01:22:14,461
Will they say my name out loud,

1964
01:22:14,463 --> 01:22:16,196
do my mama proud, I'm allowed.

1965
01:22:16,198 --> 01:22:17,431
As I force-field my rhymes

1966
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:19,033
through intergalactic
prime times,

1967
01:22:19,035 --> 01:22:20,334
it's get-up-and-go time.

1968
01:22:20,336 --> 01:22:22,336
Motherfuckers, it's showtime.

1969
01:22:22,338 --> 01:22:24,638
Yeah, bitches!

1970
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:31,679
- I'm a veteran of two wars,
and I can tell you,

1971
01:22:31,681 --> 01:22:34,481
the Founding Fathers would be
ashamed of our behavior.

1972
01:22:34,483 --> 01:22:37,084
They would laugh at us.

1973
01:22:37,086 --> 01:22:41,588
Adding a stop sign at the corner
of Dumont and Crawford

1974
01:22:41,590 --> 01:22:43,550
is exactly
what they fought against.

1975
01:22:45,061 --> 01:22:46,660
- Time.

1976
01:22:46,662 --> 01:22:49,630
Thank you, Mr. Hapsburg.

1977
01:22:49,632 --> 01:22:51,432
- Thank you.

1978
01:22:51,434 --> 01:22:53,734
- It's always a treat
to hear from our constituents.

1979
01:22:56,738 --> 01:22:59,273
Winetta McKey.

1980
01:22:59,275 --> 01:23:00,474
Sweetheart.

1981
01:23:05,547 --> 01:23:09,450
I never said the word "school"
or "crossing."

1982
01:23:09,452 --> 01:23:10,985
- That's what I wrote down.

1983
01:23:10,987 --> 01:23:14,221
- Oh, must be
the pen's fault, then.

1984
01:23:14,223 --> 01:23:16,991
- 62 Huntsman Lane.

1985
01:23:16,993 --> 01:23:21,662
I would like to address
the issue of the...

1986
01:23:21,664 --> 01:23:24,398
- Oh, Donovan, be my eyes.

1987
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:27,468
- We're here;
take a look at this.

1988
01:23:27,470 --> 01:23:30,671
- I have a hip dysplasia, and...

1989
01:23:30,673 --> 01:23:33,107
- Isn't it amazing?

1990
01:23:33,109 --> 01:23:34,775
- Oh, go get 'em, babe.

1991
01:23:34,777 --> 01:23:37,544
- I wrote down things
that I can say.

1992
01:23:37,546 --> 01:23:39,713
I'll... I'll be back.

1993
01:23:39,715 --> 01:23:43,684
- Thank you so much, Ms. McKey.

1994
01:23:43,686 --> 01:23:47,054
Your insight is
very much appreciated.

1995
01:23:47,056 --> 01:23:48,455
Um...

1996
01:23:50,091 --> 01:23:51,525
Dave Stuben.

1997
01:23:59,334 --> 01:24:02,169
- Yeah!
Dave!

1998
01:24:02,171 --> 01:24:04,538
- Dave, yeah.
- This is amazing.

1999
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:05,572
Dave!

2000
01:24:05,574 --> 01:24:07,207
- Dave's about to speak.

2001
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:12,112
It's gonna be... epic.

2002
01:24:12,114 --> 01:24:13,447
- Remember,
you have three minutes,

2003
01:24:13,449 --> 01:24:14,681
and three minutes only.

2004
01:24:14,683 --> 01:24:16,283
That way, we get to hear
from everyone

2005
01:24:16,285 --> 01:24:19,153
who wants to participate
in democracy.

2006
01:24:19,155 --> 01:24:20,155
- Yeah.

2007
01:24:20,156 --> 01:24:22,489
Dave Stuben.

2008
01:24:22,491 --> 01:24:23,791
In the United States,

2009
01:24:23,793 --> 01:24:26,326
all people are created equal,

2010
01:24:26,328 --> 01:24:29,196
but not in the city of Liberty.

2011
01:24:29,198 --> 01:24:32,733
Liberty is like Berlin
under Hitler.

2012
01:24:32,735 --> 01:24:34,068
And it's time to...

2013
01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:36,403
It's time to drain the swamp.

2014
01:24:38,574 --> 01:24:40,140
The town council and the mayor

2015
01:24:40,142 --> 01:24:43,143
don't answer
the people's questions.

2016
01:24:43,145 --> 01:24:47,614
And the town council
is there for us,

2017
01:24:47,616 --> 01:24:50,350
but are they there for us?

2018
01:24:50,352 --> 01:24:53,153
They're there for us...

2019
01:24:53,155 --> 01:24:55,656
but "no" is more like it.

2020
01:25:03,531 --> 01:25:07,668
I believe in all people
and religion and freedom

2021
01:25:07,670 --> 01:25:10,204
and justice for all.

2022
01:25:10,206 --> 01:25:13,240
We used to be part of England
under the king,

2023
01:25:13,242 --> 01:25:15,742
and one of the grievances was,

2024
01:25:15,744 --> 01:25:18,612
"He sent hither swarms
of officers

2025
01:25:18,614 --> 01:25:22,449
to harass our people
and eat out our substance."

2026
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:24,818
That is a quote from
the Declaration of Independence,

2027
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:26,620
and I would like that
put in the record.

2028
01:25:26,622 --> 01:25:28,388
Official request.

2029
01:25:29,892 --> 01:25:33,227
So I have a question, then,
for the city council

2030
01:25:33,229 --> 01:25:36,163
and especially you,
Ms. Casserta.

2031
01:25:36,165 --> 01:25:39,466
If I do pay my fair share
of taxes,

2032
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:43,570
How come I can't get nobody
to plow my street?

2033
01:25:51,312 --> 01:25:54,348
- Well, Mr. Stuben...

2034
01:25:54,350 --> 01:25:56,717
Here in Liberty,
we are very lucky

2035
01:25:56,719 --> 01:26:00,287
to have a reciprocal agreement
with the village of Ellenville

2036
01:26:00,289 --> 01:26:02,289
so that if something
were to happen...

2037
01:26:02,291 --> 01:26:03,790
- Yes, okay, yeah.

2038
01:26:03,792 --> 01:26:05,826
Well, guess what,
I talked to that guy,

2039
01:26:05,828 --> 01:26:07,327
or tried to call him.

2040
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:11,231
Mr...
Mr. Anucci, that jerk.

2041
01:26:11,233 --> 01:26:13,734
And getting...
Getting an answer from him

2042
01:26:13,736 --> 01:26:16,403
is like getting blood
from a turnip!

2043
01:26:16,405 --> 01:26:21,675
So, Ms. Casserta, my question
for you is the same one.

2044
01:26:21,677 --> 01:26:24,244
How do I get somebody
to plow my street?

2045
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:32,519
- Well, I don't know how else
to explain this, Dave.

2046
01:26:32,521 --> 01:26:36,190
But if we run short
here in Liberty,

2047
01:26:36,192 --> 01:26:38,559
we are lucky enough to be able
to go to Ellenville and...

2048
01:26:38,561 --> 01:26:40,260
- Yeah, I understand that.

2049
01:26:40,262 --> 01:26:41,828
I understand that, remember?

2050
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:44,231
A few weeks ago
when I had a letter

2051
01:26:44,233 --> 01:26:49,303
from Amnesty International
and the federal attorney general

2052
01:26:49,305 --> 01:26:51,705
and you made me feel ridiculous?

2053
01:26:51,707 --> 01:26:56,210
Well, guess who's feeling
ridiculous now, Ms. Casserta.

2054
01:26:56,212 --> 01:27:01,882
'Cause I have the whole town
and TV and the entire internet.

2055
01:27:03,552 --> 01:27:07,354
And they're watching you
make a fool of yourself.

2056
01:27:07,356 --> 01:27:09,890
- Dave, let's stay calm now,
okay?

2057
01:27:09,892 --> 01:27:11,858
- I am one man
trying to seek redress

2058
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:14,361
from his elected officials.

2059
01:27:14,363 --> 01:27:16,664
I am trying to right a wrong...
- Time.

2060
01:27:16,665 --> 01:27:17,998
- In Liberty!

2061
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,566
- Thank you, Mr. Stuben.
- No, no more.

2062
01:27:19,568 --> 01:27:20,801
No, I have more to say!

2063
01:27:20,803 --> 01:27:22,236
- That is all the time you have.
- No!

2064
01:27:22,238 --> 01:27:23,470
You will let me speak!

2065
01:27:24,473 --> 01:27:25,539
You will let me speak!

2066
01:27:25,541 --> 01:27:27,341
- Let Dave speak!

2067
01:27:27,343 --> 01:27:28,942
Let Dave speak!

2068
01:27:28,944 --> 01:27:30,477
Let Dave speak!

2069
01:27:30,479 --> 01:27:33,814
- Where in the U.S. Constitution
does it say

2070
01:27:33,816 --> 01:27:35,882
that people only get
three minutes to speak?

2071
01:27:35,884 --> 01:27:37,251
Let Dave speak!

2072
01:27:37,253 --> 01:27:38,485
- Ask your lawyer that!

2073
01:27:38,487 --> 01:27:39,720
Ask your lawyer that!

2074
01:27:39,722 --> 01:27:40,821
- That's enough, Dave.

2075
01:27:40,823 --> 01:27:42,623
And I will have the rest of you

2076
01:27:42,625 --> 01:27:44,858
thrown out
for public disturbance.

2077
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:46,760
- And it's... ugh!

2078
01:27:46,762 --> 01:27:48,895
It's 'cause of those Jews
who run that stupid ACLU!

2079
01:27:48,897 --> 01:27:51,565
And they won't return my letters
'cause they're too busy

2080
01:27:51,567 --> 01:27:53,700
defending all the scum
of the earth,

2081
01:27:53,702 --> 01:27:54,901
like gays and Muslims!

2082
01:27:54,903 --> 01:27:56,737
- That is quite enough.

2083
01:27:56,739 --> 01:27:58,805
- And it's 'cause you
are taking marching orders

2084
01:27:58,807 --> 01:28:00,374
from Barack Obama,

2085
01:28:00,376 --> 01:28:02,416
that socialist nigger
in the White House!

2086
01:28:03,379 --> 01:28:04,411
Yes, you are!

2087
01:28:04,413 --> 01:28:06,313
You are being bullied by him!

2088
01:28:06,315 --> 01:28:08,949
And I don't even
support him officially.

2089
01:28:08,951 --> 01:28:11,418
Barack<i> Hussein</i> Obama.

2090
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:13,020
Did you know "Barack"
is a Jewish word?

2091
01:28:13,022 --> 01:28:14,488
And it means lightning.

2092
01:28:14,490 --> 01:28:16,757
It's in the Bible,
Luke 10:18.

2093
01:28:16,759 --> 01:28:18,725
Satan came down as lightning.

2094
01:28:18,727 --> 01:28:19,993
- That's enough.

2095
01:28:19,995 --> 01:28:22,029
- Satan will come down
as lightning!

2096
01:28:22,031 --> 01:28:23,797
- Wait, was that part of your...
- No!

2097
01:28:23,799 --> 01:28:25,799
- That's in the Bible!
I want it in the record!

2098
01:28:25,801 --> 01:28:27,067
I want it in the record!

2099
01:28:28,070 --> 01:28:29,070
- Dave.

2100
01:28:29,071 --> 01:28:30,771
- You, and all the liberal...

2101
01:28:30,773 --> 01:28:33,006
All the liberal Jew-run media
and their enablers!

2102
01:28:33,008 --> 01:28:34,008
- Dave.

2103
01:28:34,009 --> 01:28:35,409
- They are authorizing

2104
01:28:35,411 --> 01:28:36,777
the corporate elite
in this country!

2105
01:28:36,779 --> 01:28:38,445
- Dave, don't make me...

2106
01:28:38,447 --> 01:28:39,780
- I heard that on Alex Jones,
so it's true!

2107
01:28:39,782 --> 01:28:41,548
- Dave.

2108
01:28:41,550 --> 01:28:43,350
- I heard it on Alex Jones,
so I know it's true!

2109
01:28:43,352 --> 01:28:45,585
- Guards, remove Mr. Stuben
from the floor.

2110
01:28:45,587 --> 01:28:47,321
- You and your global warming!

2111
01:28:47,323 --> 01:28:48,989
If global warming's
such a problem,

2112
01:28:48,991 --> 01:28:51,758
how come my street
has snow all over it

2113
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:53,860
for an entire winter?

2114
01:28:53,862 --> 01:28:55,429
How come?

2115
01:28:55,431 --> 01:28:56,630
I am talking.

2116
01:28:56,632 --> 01:28:58,965
I have a right to speak
in this council.

2117
01:28:58,967 --> 01:29:00,867
These people are with me!

2118
01:29:00,869 --> 01:29:02,602
These people are with me!

2119
01:29:02,604 --> 01:29:04,037
- I'm with you
on some of it, Dave!

2120
01:29:04,039 --> 01:29:05,439
- They're behind me!

2121
01:29:05,441 --> 01:29:06,740
- On some of it, Dave.

2122
01:29:06,742 --> 01:29:08,342
Oh, I see.

2123
01:29:08,344 --> 01:29:10,344
You're a bunch of cattle.

2124
01:29:10,346 --> 01:29:11,346
Huh?

2125
01:29:11,347 --> 01:29:12,713
When the truth comes out,

2126
01:29:12,715 --> 01:29:15,749
the cowards sit down
and shut their mouths.

2127
01:29:15,751 --> 01:29:16,783
Yeah.

2128
01:29:16,785 --> 01:29:18,652
Nothing but a bunch of cows.

2129
01:29:21,523 --> 01:29:23,557
Why don't you faggots
go back to Jew York

2130
01:29:23,559 --> 01:29:25,058
and finish sucking
each other's cocks?

2131
01:29:25,060 --> 01:29:27,594
- We the people are
the government, Ms. Casserta!

2132
01:29:27,596 --> 01:29:28,595
- You give 'em hell, Dave!

2133
01:29:28,597 --> 01:29:29,830
I got your back!

2134
01:29:36,872 --> 01:29:38,071
- Don't worry, Mr. Stuben.

2135
01:29:38,073 --> 01:29:39,506
I got your back.

2136
01:29:39,508 --> 01:29:40,874
I'm doing this for Katelyn.

2137
01:29:40,876 --> 01:29:42,075
I love your daughter!

2138
01:29:42,077 --> 01:29:43,077
I'm Cory.

2139
01:29:43,078 --> 01:29:44,111
It's C-to-the-Y.

2140
01:29:44,113 --> 01:29:45,113
And in between it's "R."

2141
01:29:45,114 --> 01:29:46,713
- The fuck?

2142
01:29:53,822 --> 01:29:55,689
- Ah!
Ahh!

2143
01:29:55,691 --> 01:29:57,491
- What is happening over there?

2144
01:29:57,493 --> 01:29:59,025
Honey, are you okay?

2145
01:30:03,932 --> 01:30:06,967
- Isn't somebody
gonna stop this?

2146
01:30:06,969 --> 01:30:10,003
- If you can hear this computer,
help him!

2147
01:30:22,751 --> 01:30:24,017
- There you go, yeah.

2148
01:30:24,019 --> 01:30:25,019
- Ah!

2149
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:27,587
- There you go.

2150
01:30:27,589 --> 01:30:28,622
- It's all right, everyone.

2151
01:30:28,624 --> 01:30:29,890
Calm down, calm down.

2152
01:30:29,892 --> 01:30:30,892
Everybody, calm down.

2153
01:30:30,893 --> 01:30:32,459
- This is what you have wrought!

2154
01:30:32,461 --> 01:30:34,628
This whole town council
is rotten to the core!

2155
01:30:34,630 --> 01:30:35,662
- Shut up, Dave!

2156
01:30:35,664 --> 01:30:36,664
- Come on, come on.

2157
01:30:36,665 --> 01:30:38,498
- Turn the fucking hip-hop off!

2158
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:40,980
Can someone show me how to turn
this fucking thing off, please?

2159
01:30:43,038 --> 01:30:45,472
- All right.
- YOLO, motherfuckers!

2160
01:30:45,474 --> 01:30:46,940
Katelyn, I'm on TV!

2161
01:30:46,942 --> 01:30:48,542
- Katelyn?

2162
01:30:48,544 --> 01:30:49,910
- Dad, please.

2163
01:30:49,912 --> 01:30:51,511
This is my time now.

2164
01:30:51,513 --> 01:30:53,780
- Baby.

2165
01:30:56,752 --> 01:30:59,219
Hi.

2166
01:30:59,221 --> 01:31:00,487
I'm Katelyn Stuben.

2167
01:31:00,489 --> 01:31:02,055
I'm from Liberty, New York.

2168
01:31:02,057 --> 01:31:04,758
And I will be singing
<i>Brave</i> by Sara Bareilles.

2169
01:32:10,825 --> 01:32:11,858
- Katelyn!

2170
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:12,926
Stop!

2171
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:14,728
Ugh!

2172
01:32:17,966 --> 01:32:19,065
Egh!

2173
01:32:29,011 --> 01:32:32,212
- Well, it's the story
that just won't go away.

2174
01:32:32,214 --> 01:32:33,980
Last week's crazy story

2175
01:32:33,982 --> 01:32:35,949
from the small town
of Liberty, New York,

2176
01:32:35,951 --> 01:32:39,119
just keeps getting,
well, even crazier.

2177
01:32:39,121 --> 01:32:41,221
- Well, crazy isn't even
the half of it, Mario.

2178
01:32:41,223 --> 01:32:42,789
Apparently, Katelyn Stuben,

2179
01:32:42,791 --> 01:32:44,991
the girl who hijacked
the city council meeting

2180
01:32:44,993 --> 01:32:47,961
and "sang"
the Sara Bareilles song<i> Brave,</i>

2181
01:32:47,963 --> 01:32:49,896
now has a sex tape out.

2182
01:32:49,898 --> 01:32:50,931
- Oh.

2183
01:32:50,933 --> 01:32:51,965
- No word of how it was leaked

2184
01:32:51,967 --> 01:32:53,233
or who leaked it,

2185
01:32:53,235 --> 01:32:55,702
but it has gone
absolutely viral,

2186
01:32:55,704 --> 01:32:57,971
and a mash-up of the two videos
has quickly become

2187
01:32:57,973 --> 01:33:00,340
the most popular video
on the internet.

2188
01:33:00,342 --> 01:33:04,177
- Now, we must stress that
Katelyn is only 19 years old,

2189
01:33:04,179 --> 01:33:06,613
so this show
does not necessarily

2190
01:33:06,615 --> 01:33:08,648
approve of our airing this.

2191
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:12,786
- I'm Katelyn Stuben.

2192
01:33:12,788 --> 01:33:14,588
I'm from Liberty, New York.

2193
01:33:14,590 --> 01:33:16,756
And I'll be singing<i> Brave</i>
by Sara Bareilles.

2194
01:36:40,061 --> 01:36:41,795
- Thank you, Contestant 1.

2195
01:36:41,797 --> 01:36:45,498
And now, singing<i> Harden my Heart</i>
by Quarterflash,

2196
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:48,101
all the way from
Liberty, New York,

2197
01:36:48,103 --> 01:36:50,103
here is Crystal Minari.

2198
01:36:53,275 --> 01:36:55,308
- Thank you, Contestant 1.

2199
01:36:55,310 --> 01:36:59,045
And now, singing<i> Harden my Heart</i>
by Quarterflash,

2200
01:36:59,047 --> 01:37:01,414
all the way from
Liberty, New York,

2201
01:37:01,416 --> 01:37:03,416
here is Crystal Minari.

2202
01:37:06,154 --> 01:37:07,987
- Thank you, Contestant 1.

2203
01:37:07,989 --> 01:37:11,925
And now, singing<i> Harden my Heart</i>
by Quarterflash,

2204
01:37:11,927 --> 01:37:14,260
all the way from
Liberty, New York,

2205
01:37:14,262 --> 01:37:16,262
here is Crystal Minari.

2206
01:37:26,208 --> 01:37:27,208
- Hey!

2207
01:37:27,232 --> 01:37:57,232
<font color="#ffff00">♪ <i><b>Hope it helped -> bozxphd</b></i> ♪</font>
