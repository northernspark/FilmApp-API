Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

3
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,800
Thanks, Joe.

4
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,400
Oh, shit.

5
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,600
Yo, K-Ro,
where you going, man?

6
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,400
- K-Ro, what's up?
- Hey, baby.

7
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,300
Somebody just shot my club up.
That's what I say, shot my club up.

8
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,000
What you need to know my name?
Get the police.

9
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,900
What do you mean you ain't coming?

10
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,600
I give you first shot
at making me an offer...

11
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,900
...on this four-bedroom
Mt. Olympus...

12
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,600
...and you leave me
sitting here two hours...

13
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,800
...and now you're telling me
you ain't... Hello?

14
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,400
Shit.

15
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,400
Gavilan.

16
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,400
Yeah, give me 10 minutes.
Be right there.

17
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
Yeah, it's Calden.

18
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,300
Oh, shit.

19
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,800
I'll be there in seven minutes. Yeah.

20
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,100
- Hi, Joe. How you doing?
- Okay, how are you?

21
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,400
Find anybody to buy
that house yet?

22
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,500
No. Showed it a couple of times
last week. There's some interest.

23
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,700
- I hear we got a messy one here.
- Yeah.

24
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,000
Joe, K.C.

25
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,900
- Hey, Leon.
- Hey.

26
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,400
I'm making you two
primaries in this disaster.

27
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,500
Since you've made no progress in the
Klepto murder, I figure you're due.

28
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,900
- Thanks for the confidence.
- No problem.

29
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,800
- Do you have a body count?
- Can we get a statement?

30
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,800
- What do we got, Leon?
- One on the floor, three backstage.

31
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,300
Rap group, calls itself H2OKlick.
Don't ask me why.

32
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,000
- Joint was full?
- Yeah.

33
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,800
- Nobody saw it.
- Of course not.

34
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,100
- Are these things on?
- They were. They're off now.

35
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,100
Listen, get them out of here.
Now, come on.

36
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,100
Let's go.

37
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,400
Well, what do you think?

38
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,400
Write this down.

39
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,700
Cheeseburger, well-done.

40
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:14,300
Raw onion, pickle, ketchup.
Nothing else.

41
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,900
Got it.

42
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,000
Officer.

43
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,600
Time to get rolling on some chow.
This is what the big dog wants.

44
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,000
And I want tomato and cucumber
on whole wheat...

45
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,100
...with only mustard
and bean sprouts.

46
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,800
Hey, Lou, nobody
goes in here, okay?

47
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,600
Got you.

48
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,200
It looks like one shooter came
from down there.

49
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,400
The other came from down there.

50
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,900
This poor son of a bitch
got it from both sides.

51
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,500
- Yeah.
- How long you had this place?

52
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,800
Man, I only had this place two years.
This is messed up.

53
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,900
- Where you living?
- At the Bel Age.

54
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,600
- Bel Age?
- Right up the road...

55
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,500
...but it's just temporary.

56
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,800
- Where were you when it occurred?
- In my office. Right there.

57
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,200
- These guys were about to break out.
- The boys was blowing up.

58
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,800
Sartain Records.
Antoine Sartain, that's the big man.

59
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,200
- These guys have any trouble?
- Some sort of turf war?

60
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,000
I know nothing about no
East Coast-West Coast...

61
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,000
...hip-hop, gangbanging bullshit.

62
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,600
I'm just a poor country boy
trying to get by.

63
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,400
- Getting by pretty well, I'd say.
- I do okay.

64
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,800
Hello? Hold on. Hello?

65
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,200
Hello? Hold on just a second, let me...

66
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,700
Hey, Stan.

67
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,200
Stan, that four-bedroom
Mt. Olympus fell through.

68
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,000
Can you make me an offer?

69
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,900
Eddie, you got those shoe prints?

70
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,800
Two prints.
Matching pattern, different sizes.

71
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,600
That's a 9. That's an 11.

72
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,400
Hey, you, come here.
I see mayonnaise.

73
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,900
Did anybody in this room
hear me say the word mayonnaise?

74
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,700
Read your notes.
What does it say?

75
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,400
Cheeseburger, well-done,
ketchup, pickle.

76
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
You call that well-done?

77
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,400
In addition to the mayonnaise...

78
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,100
...I see lettuce that somebody
tried to scrape off here.

79
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,900
This is a disaster.

80
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,100
What do they teach you
at the Academy?

81
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,200
You want to be a detective?

82
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,500
- Yes, sir.
- Don't call me sir. I work for a living.

83
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,400
Dump this for me, please.
I expect better.

84
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,900
- Joe, kid's got something.
- Gavilan.

85
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,100
No, 675 won't fly.

86
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,600
If you're gonna get back to me,
have at least 7 and change.

87
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,600
Diamond earring.

88
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,000
Could be something,
could be nothing. Good work, kid.

89
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,300
Did you get the piss and
the shoe prints in the closet?

90
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,300
Yeah, I got it, Joe.

91
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm gonna go hammer
on the owner a little more.

92
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,900
How come you got no video
surveillance, big-ass place like this?

93
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,400
How come you got no video
surveillance, big-ass place like this?

94
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,800
- What kind of security you got?
- I ain't never had no problems.

95
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,700
You got a problem now.
Two guys sneak in with guns.

96
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:40,600
- Who does your security anyway?
- A bunch of off-duty L.A.P.D. Cops.

97
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,200
That's your first mistake.

98
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,600
Man, why you ragging on me?
All I'm trying to do is just business.

99
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,000
Julius, you're making me curious.
How come you live in a hotel?

100
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,900
I just sold my crib.
The new one fell through.

101
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,300
So I'm sort of, like,
looking right now.

102
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,700
You're sort of looking
for a new house?

103
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,000
That's what I said.

104
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,100
Julius, look...

105
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,800
...in my other career
I'm a real-estate broker.

106
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,500
Real-estate broker?
You got two jobs?

107
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,800
We work a lot of overtime,
we get time off.

108
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,600
A lot of guys have three jobs.

109
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,700
- What you saying?
- What I'm saying...

110
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,900
...is I got a beautiful 3400-square-foot
house on Mt. Olympus.

111
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,800
New roof, partial view.
Owner's desperate.

112
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,700
Man, I don't want no crap
on no Mt. Olympics.

113
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,400
Well, what you looking for?

114
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,100
I'm looking for a big house,
something with class.

115
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,900
How much will you pay
for something with class?

116
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,100
Not a penny more than 6.

117
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,600
- Six?
- That's what I said, 6.

118
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,800
Million?

119
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,700
I was not soliciting.
I was doing research.

120
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,800
Research is not soliciting.

121
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,300
I've never had to pay for sex.
I have four BAFTA nominations.

122
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,900
Evening, Gloria.
Do you know who I am?

123
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,100
- Here's our dead guys.
- Thanks.

124
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,800
The puddle of piss makes me think
we got a witness.

125
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,300
- Just sit down there and shut up.
- You shut up.

126
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,200
I can't work here.
This place is a zoo.

127
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,000
Let's get out of here
before Boardner's closes.

128
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,100
The doctor's in. Help's on its way.

129
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,000
Thanks, Hank.

130
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,800
- Something wrong, Joe?
- What do you mean, "wrong"?

131
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,800
You seem down.

132
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,500
Down? Me?

133
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,900
Lately. Yeah.

134
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,300
We've been partners for four months.
Now you want to be my shrink?

135
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,500
Sometimes it helps to talk.
That's all I'm saying.

136
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,200
All right.

137
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,200
Let me paint you a picture.

138
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,400
Portrait of Joe Gavilan.

139
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,000
Seven, eight years ago,
I sold the results...

140
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,000
...of my entrepreneurial efforts
up to that point.

141
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,700
Three tanning salons...

142
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:24,400
...and two original silk-tip
nail parlors in the Antelope Valley.

143
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,400
And I started attending...

144
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,000
...weekend real-estate seminars
at the airport Hyatt.

145
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,900
You know, how to make
a million dollars...

146
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,400
...in real estate
with very little money down.

147
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,500
Sounds good.

148
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,600
Started with a condo
in Sherman Oaks.

149
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,800
Slapped paint on the walls.
Refaced the kitchen cabinets.

150
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,300
Traded up to a smoke-damaged
ranch in Tarzana.

151
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,600
Then a Spanish on Outpost...

152
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,600
...and a fake Mediterranean
in Los Feliz.

153
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:57,300
Pretty soon I had everything
I've got tied up in this...

154
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,300
...this monstrosity on Mt. Olympus...

155
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,500
...at the corner of Hercules
and, I shit you not, Achilles.

156
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,000
- What's the problem?
- The problem is...

157
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,100
...if I don't score a big commission
or get rid of this...

158
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,600
...piece of shit on Mt. Olympus...

159
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,000
Well, the word Titanic
comes to mind.

160
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,700
Joe, I know a girl who works
for some rich producer.

161
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,600
Says he might sell his place.
Maybe you can get the listing.

162
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,800
- Got a name?
- Her name's like Minnie or Moma.

163
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,400
Something like that,
I don't remember.

164
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,100
Not the girl, hot rocks,
the producer.

165
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:41,300
Oh, I don't know the producer.
Way before my time.

166
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,800
- Hey, Joe, you ready for something?
- Shoot.

167
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,800
I don't think I want
to be a cop anymore.

168
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,600
Come on, you need some fresh air.

169
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,400
- Put this on my tab, Hank.
- What tab?

170
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,600
Hey, I got it. I got it. It's okay.

171
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,700
Here.

172
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,200
If you don't want to be a cop,
what do you want to be?

173
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,000
I want to be an actor.

174
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,300
- You wanna be what?
- An actor.

175
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,900
What?

176
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,300
Okay.

177
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,400
- You're gay. I can deal with that.
- You know I'm not gay.

178
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,300
Why do you want to do
something stupid like acting?

179
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,900
Because it's my bliss.

180
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,100
And I have to follow my bliss.

181
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,200
Turning into Oprah around here.

182
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,700
I rented a theater
on Highland, Friday night.

183
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,400
I invited some agents and producers.
It's called a showcase.

184
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,900
- What are you showcasing?
- My talents.

185
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,300
Mr. Robert De Niro here.

186
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,000
Hey, detective, you're gonna say
it's none of my business...

187
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,200
...but when's the last time
you got laid?

188
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,600
None of your business.

189
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,600
Right.

190
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,800
Say it ain't so, Joe.

191
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,300
Oh, my God.

192
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,100
Jesus Christ.

193
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,800
- How's business, Jack?
- Wanda.

194
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,600
- Wanda.
- Some trick's thumping on prostitutes.

195
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,500
We put our best female officer
undercover and she got hurt, so...

196
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,000
...l'm the bait.

197
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,800
Well, you look good.

198
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,600
Well, it never hurts
to get a compliment...

199
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,100
...but that's not why
I was shaking my booty at you.

200
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,800
You're working that bloodbath
over at the Freeway Club.

201
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,800
The word's out
about the shooting.

202
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,900
Word is one guy slid out
without a scratch.

203
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,300
- Got a name or anything?
- K-Ro, K-Mart or something like that.

204
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,200
He was the group's
main songwriter.

205
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,800
- Somebody writes that shit?
- Yeah, tell me about it.

206
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,600
Want me to drop you
back where I got you?

207
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,700
Yeah, I got backup to pick me up.

208
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,300
Just swing me
back around to Cherokee.

209
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,900
These heels are killing me.
Just killing me, man.

210
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,600
This is Ruby the psychic,
Ruby the night owl...

211
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,900
...waiting for your calls,
your problems, your concerns.

212
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,500
Want to unravel the past?
Ruby can help.

213
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,600
Want to sort out the present?
Ruby can help.

214
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,100
Want to look into the future?
Ruby can do that too.

215
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:07,200
Just pick up the phone.
Smokey, where have you been?

216
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,900
{y:i}Busy guy, Ruby.

217
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,300
- Got something to share?
- Tell me about the future.

218
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,100
I see some financial concerns.
Is that right?

219
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,500
Yep.

220
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,900
Wait a minute. I'm seeing something
dangerous, maybe painful?

221
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,300
What else is new?

222
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,600
Whatever else is new
will have to wait.

223
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,000
{y:i}We're out of time.
{y:i}Why do you call so late?{y}{y}

224
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,000
Night owls, this is Ruby.

225
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,700
Mr. Sartain and I'd like to thank you.

226
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,100
I'm Mr. Sartain's colleague,
Leroy Wasley.

227
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,200
- Tell Mr. Sartain the deed's done.
- Now where's our money?

228
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,900
Here you go.

229
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,700
Oh, shit.

230
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,100
Tell me something, man. You think
Gavilan can figure this thing out?

231
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,000
Bennie Macko's not gonna let him.
He'll take him down.

232
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,800
Why would Bennie Macko
believe all this bullshit?

233
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,900
I've known Bennie a long time.

234
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,600
He graduated in the class
behind mine at the academy.

235
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,800
We were rookies together
in the same division.

236
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,700
He's a politically ambitious suit.

237
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,600
- He listens to what I tell him.
- Patience is not one of my virtues.

238
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,100
Let me explain something.

239
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,300
You can kill a street
punk like Klepto. It's no big deal.

240
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,500
These two bangers,
they didn't mean anything to anybody.

241
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:55,300
But you send them into an open
nightclub, and they cap four guys?

242
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,000
That's another mess altogether.

243
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:02,100
The last time I checked, I pay you
to run my security, not your mouth.

244
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,000
Let go of me,
you sons of bitches!

245
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,800
Stella!

246
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,000
Stella!

247
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,300
Stella!

248
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,600
Stella!

249
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:17,000
Not a knickknack, knit-lock,
knock-kneed knickerbocker sock...

250
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,900
...off a hodgepodge, moss-blotched,
botched Scotch block.

251
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,800
I got more time in the third-floor
crapper than you do on the job.

252
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,500
I got more time in the third-floor
crapper than you do on the job.

253
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,500
You can't open my locker without
a warrant. I know my rights.

254
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,500
Well, I appreciate a man who knows
his rights. There you go.

255
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:38,000
- What's going on here, cap?
- This is Bennie Macko, Internal Affairs.

256
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,800
- You got a right to an attorney.
- This is an authorized investigation...

257
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,200
...within the jurisdiction
of Los Angeles.

258
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,000
- Oh, please. I'll open it.
- Go ahead.

259
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,900
- I haven't been in there in 10 years.
- You open it.

260
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:12,100
Oh, here are those shoes.
I thought I lost these.

261
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,800
- I love these shoes.
- Ever clean your locker?

262
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,800
Between finding, apprehending
and convicting murderers...

263
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,900
...and cleaning, I made
a decision to do the former.

264
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,900
- You got a lot of lip.
- A lot of lip.

265
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,300
- Yeah, you do.
- I got a big nose too.

266
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,600
Calden, open your locker.

267
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,400
- Why him?
- He's your partner. Go ahead, open it.

268
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,600
No, don't open it.

269
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,200
- You got something to hide?
- Yeah, kind of.

270
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,400
You got to do it, son.

271
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,500
Porno.

272
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,100
Commingling funds, huh?

273
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,400
That's my crime?

274
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,900
Commingling? Guilty.

275
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,300
My alimony, number one,
comes from money...

276
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,000
...commingled
with my beer money.

277
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,700
My refinanced car commingled with
the short-term loan to keep the...

278
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:41,800
...second mortgage paid, commingled
with my alimony number three...

279
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
...commingled with
every goddamn dime...

280
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,600
...l've got tied up
in my Mt. Olympus property.

281
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,500
My whole life's commingled.

282
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,500
I'm glad you brought up
Mt. Olympus.

283
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,100
You're attempting to sell
without disclosing you own it.

284
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,900
This isn't about real estate,
is it, Bennie?

285
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:59,200
What's going on here? As immediate
supervisor of these men...

286
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,000
...you are bound to inform me
of any investigation.

287
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,200
- You're informed.
- You couldn't tell me?

288
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,900
I'm trying to find out
what I'm guilty of...

289
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,200
...besides going to one too many
airport real-estate seminars.

290
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,300
Well, for starters, you know
a woman named Cleo Ricard?

291
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,500
I talk to her. Talk's cheap.

292
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,900
Administrative Vice, which has
been watching her for two years...

293
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,400
...is making a major prostitution bust...

294
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,200
...and you're making promises
to her to intervene.

295
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,800
You haven't registered her
as an informant.

296
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:30,400
- Joe, is this true?
- By itself, that's cause for suspension.

297
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,500
I mentioned her name to District
Attorney Gardner six weeks ago.

298
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,100
- Told him I was gonna make a contact.
- He denies it.

299
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,200
He's a liar! I haven't registered
her as an informant...

300
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,900
...because she hasn't informed.

301
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,600
I don't want to get
buried under paperwork...

302
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,900
...just so Vice can tell me
to back off their suspect.

303
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,400
It's a big case for them.

304
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:55,900
- Bigger than a quadruple murder?
- This is not your decision.

305
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:00,200
As no charges have been made,
release Gavilan and Calden...

306
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,300
...so they can resume investigations.

307
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,700
- Bennie?
- Yeah, we'll talk about it.

308
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,300
- When he's out of the room.
- Fuck you very much.

309
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,100
- What is with that Macko guy?
- Oh, he's a jerk.

310
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,900
Years ago, he was lead detective
on those jockey love-nest murders.

311
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,100
You remember, big girls, little guys?

312
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,200
He bragged to the papers.
I proved he had the wrong guy.

313
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,300
Embarrassed the shit out of him.
He's been wanting to get me since.

314
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:37,600
Now he's assigned to IA,
and he's taking his shot.

315
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,700
- You can't trust cops.
- Your dad was a cop.

316
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,000
He was killed in the line of duty
under bullshit circumstances.

317
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,000
No one was held responsible,
and his case was closed.

318
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,000
The feds investigate?

319
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,700
The word is they thought
his partner was dirty...

320
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,300
...but the report's sealed tight.

321
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,900
I got a pal down there
who owes me a favor.

322
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,200
You wanna see the report,
I'll make a call.

323
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,400
I'd appreciate it. Yeah.

324
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,700
Hey, Joe, listen, what I said last night
about you getting laid...

325
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,700
...it's none of my business,
you know?

326
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,400
It's no big deal.

327
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,000
Just be safe.

328
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,400
- Safe?
- Yeah.

329
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,700
That hooker last night.

330
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,000
That was a guy.

331
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,500
I don't need to know that.

332
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:36,500
That was a cop.
That was a guy cop.

333
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,000
A cop guy.

334
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,500
- Gavilan.
- "Hello, Joe?"

335
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,800
Cleo, I was just talking about you.

336
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,300
Cleo, I was just talking about you.

337
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,100
I hope it was something good.

338
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,400
Listen, Joe, I have a little problem.
Vice is breathing down my neck.

339
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,000
Yeah, well, IA's
breathing down mine.

340
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,900
Let's go.

341
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,800
Come on, big boy.

342
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,100
- Well, I might have something for you.
- I'm listening.

343
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,900
Is this the William Morris Agency?
Yeah. Hi, this is K.C. Calden.

344
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,600
I sent a headshot, résumé...

345
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,000
...and an invitation to a performance
of "Streetcar Named Desire."

346
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,500
Hold it while I get something
out of the trunk. Where you going?

347
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,400
It's on Friday.

348
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,500
One of the girls was a regular
for one of the guys shot last night.

349
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,700
{y:i}She was also a regular of Klepto's.

350
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,500
You talk to Vice and get them
to back off me...

351
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,300
- "... and I'll talk to her".
- Not the way it works.

352
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,000
Give me the girl first.

353
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,500
Joe, why don't I send you over
a couple of ladies?

354
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,600
Big mistake. Big, big mistake.

355
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,400
You can have a party on me.

356
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,500
We'll keep it out of the book.
What do you say?

357
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,100
Not my style, Cleo. Call me back
when you got something real.

358
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,200
Yeah, I'll be playing the Brando part.

359
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,900
Hello?

360
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,600
Hello?

361
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,800
Let's go.

362
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,400
I'll call you back.

363
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,400
- I'm gonna take him, Joe.
- No, no, no. The gun's still hot!

364
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:37,100
Stay down there. Stay down.
Stay down, man. Stay there.

365
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,800
Got a live gun here.
You'll get yourself shot.

366
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:43,600
What are you talking about?
It's a standard Beretta, 15 shots.

367
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,900
- I counted.
- And one in the spout.

368
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,200
- Oh, shit.
- Did you lose this?

369
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,900
- How do I look?
- You look all right.

370
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,100
Many thanks. Now the buttons.

371
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,800
I can't do nothing with them.

372
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,300
You men with your big,
clumsy fingers.

373
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,300
May I have a drag on your cig?

374
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,600
What?

375
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,700
- Okay.
- Who writes this stuff?

376
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,100
Look, it's not stuff. It's art.

377
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,700
In fact, it's one of the
greatest plays ever.

378
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,800
And it's not the words you're
having trouble with.

379
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,800
It's the lack of conviction.
If you give it conviction...

380
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,800
...we can have a back-and-forth.

381
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,400
I know you're playing a girl,
but come on.

382
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,300
- What is this about?
- Just read.

383
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,800
It's your turn.

384
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,000
You look like you raided
some stylish shops in Paris.

385
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,000
No, wait a second,
you skipped a line.

386
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,600
As a matter of fact,
you skipped a bunch of lines.

387
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,600
Never mind, we're here.

388
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,700
K.C. Calden, Hollywood Homicide.
We're here to see Antoine Sartain.

389
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,000
He's in recording studio B, I think.

390
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,300
- Is he expecting you?
- Kind of.

391
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,800
Homicide, I want to talk
to Antoine Sartain.

392
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,300
You gentlemen
have an appointment?

393
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,900
You off-duty L.A.P.D.?

394
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,500
- You giving me a hard time?
- It's called a homicide investigation.

395
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,100
- Well, you're not going in.
- My God, he has a badge and a gun.

396
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,100
Come on, get out
of the way, will you?

397
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,100
What? A cop's gonna
hit a cop now?

398
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,000
That's a good suggestion.

399
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,400
I'm filing police brutality charges.
Assault, harassment.

400
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,100
Let me help you out there.
Sergeant Willoughby. Gavilan.

401
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,000
How's Betty?
The kids? Okay, good.

402
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,800
Look, I got an off-duty cop who wants
to file a complaint against me.

403
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Hold on a second.

404
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,300
There's been a misunderstanding.

405
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,800
Thanks a lot.

406
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,200
Finally, this is the take.
This is the one.

407
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,500
This is it, Butch.
This is the one.

408
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,100
Come on in. That's the best take.

409
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,600
We need some bells,
because this ain't happening.

410
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:22,000
- Bells?
- Everybody's using bells, man.

411
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,800
- We need some radio.
- Guys, excuse me.

412
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,300
- My opinion is gold.
- Antoine Sartain?

413
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:31,000
- What did I say to you?
- Hold up.

414
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,200
- Antoine Sartain?
- Please, hold up.

415
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,800
- L.A.P.D. Homicide.
- What's this supposed to be?

416
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,200
- Who are you, coming in here?
- I'm looking for Antoine Sartain.

417
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:44,300
Turn the music down.
Turn the music down.

418
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,700
Chill on the real. On the real, chill.
Because you know what?

419
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,800
What you want, man?
You Hollywood dicks are all the same.

420
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,500
Hey.

421
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,300
You all saw that, right?
That's police brutality.

422
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,200
- Don't think I won't report you.
- Help me out here.

423
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,300
Do you know this guy?
Help me out.

424
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,500
Do you know this guy?

425
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,200
Because I don't recognize him.
These the same guys?

426
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,300
These your friends?

427
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,800
- Yeah, we know these guys.
- That's my boy, man.

428
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,200
Do you know where
I can find Mr. Sartain?

429
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,200
He just left. He's on the 10th floor.

430
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,900
- Elevator's over there.
- Thank you very much.

431
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,200
K.C. Calden?

432
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:38,000
- Silk Brown, baby. Crenshaw High.
- Oh, yeah. How you doing, brother?

433
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,400
I'm all right. Told you I knew this dude.

434
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,500
I'll stick around here and see
if I can find out anything.

435
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,900
Look at him!
Didn't know you were a cop, man.

436
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,200
Actually, I'm thinking about
getting out of this L.A.P.D. Shit.

437
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,400
- What you working, man?
- I did some acting in high school.

438
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,700
- Thinking about the movie thing.
- I knew we came for a reason.

439
00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:01,100
- Baby, talk to him. Go ahead.
- Well, I did a Jell-O commercial once.

440
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:05,500
- That's right. The blue Jell-O girl.
- That was me. J-E-L-L-O.

441
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,600
- You did a great job. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

442
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,200
- She sold a shitload of Jell-O too.
- I believe that.

443
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,100
This is nice.

444
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:25,200
Trying to imagine what it was like
when this was all still glamorous.

445
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,800
It's been a long time since anything
happened at Hollywood and Vine.

446
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,400
- Can I offer you something? Anything?
- No, I just want to ask a few questions.

447
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,200
Oh, sure. Sure.

448
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,100
- Have a seat, please.
- Thanks.

449
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,700
So how long ago did you sign...

450
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:52,200
...H2OKlick?
- Five years ago.

451
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,800
I don't really know this music.

452
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,300
- Were they good?
- Most people don't know this.

453
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,000
But I lose money on 19
out of 20 new groups.

454
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:05,900
But one breakout...
One breakout pays for everything.

455
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,900
Were these guys gonna break out?

456
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,800
They had a chance, yeah.

457
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,000
You know these fellas personally?

458
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,900
I can't afford to get
too close to my acts.

459
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,000
Because, sooner or later,
I'm gonna have to be the guy...

460
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,700
...that doesn't renew their contracts.
- Brutal business.

461
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,700
Brutal business. Brutal.

462
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:33,200
So I don't have an agent right now,
but I can do accents.

463
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:37,600
I do English, I do Jamaican
and even Texas.

464
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,500
- And I even play the piano and tennis.
- Yeah, she real good, dude.

465
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,200
Silk got this script
that's off the hook, man.

466
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,300
I got the script with Oscar
shit written all over it.

467
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,600
- I'll tell you what it's called.
- Tell him.

468
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,200
Tell him the title. You will love
this title. Tell him the title.

469
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,200
- Let me hear it.
- You ready for this?

470
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,600
- It's called...
- Listen to this.

471
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,100
..."Nasty."

472
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,300
- Tell me that ain't hot!
- That's a good title.

473
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,300
I'm into titties and shit blowing up.

474
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,700
- But nothing exploitive.
- No, none of that.

475
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,600
- Gotta respect the female.
- Always.

476
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:14,200
Maybe I can help you out with this,
but you guys can help me out too.

477
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,800
Give me a call if you hear anything
about this H2OKlick thing, all right?

478
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:22,900
We ain't no snitches or nothing
like that, you know. Come on, now.

479
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,200
- No, I don't wanna ask you to do that.
- No.

480
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,800
You hold on to that just in case
something comes up. You never know.

481
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,500
How much time you spend
in the joint, Antoine?

482
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,000
Much too long for my taste.

483
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,500
My accountant let me down.

484
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,000
Something about
commingling of funds.

485
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,700
Yeah, it could happen to anybody.

486
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,500
Must take a lot of money to get
one of these groups up and running.

487
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:55,600
How much did you have
invested in Klepto?

488
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,900
Now, that was a bad investment.

489
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,900
He left my label. Why you asking?

490
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,700
I'm just fascinated
by the music business.

491
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:19,100
One last thing. Young fellow goes
by the name of K-Ro.

492
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,600
Did some songs for H2O.

493
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,000
Know his real name
or where I can find him?

494
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,200
- I'd like to ask him a few questions.
- K-Ro.

495
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,700
No, I don't... I don't even know
the guy's real name.

496
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,300
I mean, most of these kids
have some badass names.

497
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,300
They all think they're thugs.

498
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,200
For most, it's just an act.
Bunch of mama's boys.

499
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,000
First they're down with a brother,
then they're ungrateful asses.

500
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,500
Half of them would be dead
or in prison if it wasn't for me.

501
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:52,900
You know what I'm saying, detective?
It's just a game. Nothing but a game.

502
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,800
Well, we got four mama's boys
laying on slabs at the morgue.

503
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,700
It wasn't a game last night.

504
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:06,500
I'll let you go. Thanks for your help.
If you think of anything more...

505
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,100
...you let me know, okay?
- Sure.

506
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,600
Detective.

507
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,600
What, are you trying to sell me
some real estate?

508
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,400
- What do you got?
- I know Sartain's lying to me.

509
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,300
- How do you know that?
- His lips are moving.

510
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,600
- What do you got there?
- It's a script from the guys in there.

511
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,300
They say they'll call if they
come across anything.

512
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,900
They say they don't know about
last night. They're lying too.

513
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,700
You get the name of that
producer selling his house?

514
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,100
- I'll get it now. Just a second.
- All right.

515
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,000
Mimi?

516
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,700
Mona, right. Sorry.

517
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,000
Do you know the name of that
producer selling his place up on...?

518
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,700
Yeah.

519
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,900
Thank you. Yeah, sorry. Bye.

520
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:45,100
- Jerry Duran?
- Jerry Duran. Used to be huge.

521
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:49,100
- Joe, somebody's stealing your car!
- It's insured, so it's okay.

522
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,200
No, it's not okay!

523
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,000
Hey! Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

524
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,900
Stop! Police!

525
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,700
Stop!

526
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,000
All right!

527
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,100
Get out of the car!
Get your hands up!

528
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,300
Stop! Get down! Get down!

529
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,300
Get down on the ground!
Get down!

530
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,600
Put your hands where I can see them.
Get them behind your back.

531
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,100
Don't cuff us.
We weren't stealing your car.

532
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,900
- We're repo guys.
- You kidding me?

533
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,300
Nice shot, slick.

534
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,200
Now we gotta spend the afternoon
booking car thieves...

535
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,600
...filling out paperwork.

536
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:45,200
- They weren't stealing it.
- What do you call it?

537
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,400
Repo.

538
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,300
Apparently, you're behind
on your payments.

539
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,900
You assholes, get out of here!
Get out of here! Goddamn it! Get out!

540
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,300
Shit! That was a good tire!

541
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,800
Hey, Roy. Joe Gavilan just left.

542
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,600
He was in here looking for K-Ro.

543
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,800
{y:i}He must've been
{y:i}the other guy backstage.{y}{y}

544
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,500
'Toine, listen to me.

545
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,400
- It's taken care of.
- No, no, it's not taken care of.

546
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,900
If it was, Gavilan wouldn't
be here in my face.

547
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,800
After tonight, K-Ro's just a memory.

548
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,700
Not after tonight. Take care of it now.

549
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:33,000
- By the time homicide finds him...
- Get it taken care of. Now!

550
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,300
K.C.!

551
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,500
- Kimberly, hey!
- Shawna!

552
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,100
You dog, you.

553
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,000
- Yes?
- L.A.P.D. Mr. Duran, please.

554
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,700
One moment, please.

555
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:16,900
You just shut up and let me
do the talking, all right?

556
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,900
- Gentlemen.
- Mr. Duran. Hollywood Homicide.

557
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:26,600
Detective Joe Gavilan.
My partner, K.C. Calden.

558
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,200
- There must be some mistake.
- I think I've got a buyer for your house.

559
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,200
- I won't go a penny under 5.7.
- I was thinking 6.

560
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:39,200
- So that's, what, five bedrooms?
- Six bedrooms upstairs, six baths.

561
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,200
Guesthouse has two baths,
two bedrooms.

562
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,400
And in the servants' quarters,
two bedrooms, two baths.

563
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:50,800
Now, this room's a beaut. You got
a whole view of Benedict Canyon. It's...

564
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:53,600
Hey, don't you have something
to do in the kitchen?

565
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,500
There's a lost wax fountain
at the bottom of this.

566
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,800
It's a piece of work.
You should see that.

567
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,100
And this is a living room.

568
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,700
Mr. Duran, are you still
making music and movies?

569
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,800
When I can, kid.

570
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,200
Well...

571
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,500
...what are you doing on Friday night?
- Friday night's a long time away, kid.

572
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:22,200
- Beautiful house, Mr. Duran.
- Thank you.

573
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,200
I've got a desperate buyer.

574
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,500
Give me a three-day exclusive listing.

575
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:30,700
- Lf I don't sell it in that time, deal's off.
- I'll give you 48 hours.

576
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,400
The great and the near-great.

577
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:41,100
I used to be huge.

578
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:46,200
- I could be huge again.
- You're still huge to me, Mr. Duran.

579
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,500
You got 72 hours to sell my house.

580
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,600
- Thank you.
- Let me show you the door.

581
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,900
Joe Gavilan. Look, I found you
your big house with class.

582
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,700
But you got to get over here
right away.

583
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,800
- There's a lot of interest.
- "What's up?"

584
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,900
I got $6 million. You been talking.
Show me the house.

585
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:22,100
3500 Shadow Hills Way, Beverly Hills.

586
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:27,600
How soon...? Within an hour?
Okay, great.

587
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,200
Gavilan. Yeah, Leon.

588
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,600
{y:i}Mando's got something for you.
{y:i}Hold on.{y}{y}

589
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,600
Joe, the kid who split the club.

590
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:39,900
{y:i}K- Ro, born Oliver Robidoux, 5/78.
{y:i}Went to Leuzinger High...{y}{y}

591
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,700
...in Compton, graduated '95.

592
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,000
- "Address unknown."
- Oliver Robidoux.

593
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,700
- I hope they do haul you in...
- Leon, that name ring a bell with you?

594
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:52,100
- Robidoux, Robidoux. Sounds familiar.
- Yeah, a Motown singer.

595
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:57,000
Olivia Robidoux used to sing backup
for Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell.

596
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,600
- Stella!
- Put Lopez back on.

597
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:03,300
Run Olivia Robidoux, will you?
Music unions, ASCAP, anything.

598
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:06,300
- Get back to me, okay?
- I hope they do haul you in...

599
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,600
- K-Ro.
...and turn the fire hose on you.

600
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:15,000
- You whelp of a Polack, you.
- Hey. K-Ro is one Oliver Robidoux.

601
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:20,200
I think his mom was this backup
singer for Motown, Olivia Robidoux.

602
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,500
- We're finally getting somewhere.
- Let's go.

603
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,800
Hey, look, I gotta show the house.

604
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,200
- Now?
- How about you cover the autopsies?

605
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,400
- I don't like dead bodies.
- Come on, I'll owe you one.

606
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:42,600
- You coming to my play Friday night?
- Yeah, I'm coming to your play. Sure.

607
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,700
Well, there's still some seats open.

608
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:49,700
All right, I'll bring some people, okay?

609
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,300
All right, you got a deal.

610
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,500
- Shawna, can I get a lift?
- Of course.

611
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,800
Cool. See you, Joe.

612
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:00,400
Let me take that for you.
Thanks.

613
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:02,800
It's good to see you again.

614
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,600
Man.

615
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:14,600
- Jesus!
- Sorry about that.

616
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,500
There's some towels over there, K.C.
We got a juicy one here.

617
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:38,100
- K.C. Calden, Hollywood Homicide.
- Willie Palmero, South Bureau.

618
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,400
Body drop in Vernon.

619
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,800
Couple of crispy critters here.

620
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,300
I think it was a professional hit,
a straight-up execution.

621
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:51,400
- And this earring?
- Off one of the guys.

622
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:57,200
I bet they were wearing work boots,
weren't they? Sizes 9 and 11?

623
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,700
- How'd you know?
- Jesus Christ.

624
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:08,100
Willie, I think these guys
shot those guys.

625
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,800
Beautiful home. Cool crib.

626
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:16,800
This is me.

627
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,800
The great, near-great
used to hang out here.

628
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,500
For sure?

629
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:23,600
Wow.

630
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:27,200
- He wants 7.
- Man, tell him kiss my ass.

631
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,600
No, now wait.
Here's the deal.

632
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,900
You offer 5.5. He counters with 6.5.

633
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:38,600
You come back at 6.
Give him 48 hours. He'll take it.

634
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,000
- He's desperate.
- For sure?

635
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:44,300
For sure. Excuse me.

636
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,700
- Gavilan.
- "Joe, yeah."

637
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,200
{y:i}I got two bodies here in the chop
{y:i}shop that could be the triggermen.{y}{y}

638
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,800
- What do you got?
- I got the earring...

639
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,400
...and the boots. I booked them
into evidence.

640
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:58,300
- Man, what's up?
- Police business.

641
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,400
- You seen the library?
- I don't need no library. I need a pool.

642
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,300
Turf-warfare guys do
their own dirty work.

643
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:08,700
I think these guys were capped
to cover somebody else's tracks.

644
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,700
- You like tennis?
- Too much running.

645
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:15,000
I absolutely agree with you.
No, not...

646
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,400
Look, good job, kid.
I'll talk to you later.

647
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,700
Yeah, okay.

648
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,700
So, Julius...

649
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:31,200
...what do you think?
- Okay. I'll go 5.5.

650
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:34,400
All right. My man.

651
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,600
Bring the left foot back.

652
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,100
Root it there and come up
into warrior one.

653
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,500
Let your arms just raise up.

654
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:54,800
Spread your arms to the sides. Exhale.
Come back down into warrior two.

655
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:00,800
Exhale. Bring your right arm down
to your knee and then sweep across.

656
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,900
Extreme right-angle pose.

657
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:08,800
Sweep the arms up,
move your feet to parallel.

658
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,400
Pull your arms back around
behind you.

659
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:19,900
And then just feel yourself open.

660
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:23,200
Very good.

661
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:28,900
Continue that on the other side.
I'll be right back.

662
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
- What are you doing here?
- I've got something for you.

663
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,300
- How'd you find me?
- I'm psychic.

664
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,300
- Really?
- No, not really.

665
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,800
I'm a detective, for chrissake.

666
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,500
I didn't know you taught this.

667
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:44,300
- You make some dough?
- Yeah, I make 20 bucks a head.

668
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,700
- You know, donation.
- Donation? Unreportable?

669
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:51,700
Twenty times 40...
Eight hundred bucks a whack?

670
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:53,900
Cash?

671
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:58,200
Class, all right, when you're done
with this pose, we're done for the day.

672
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:01,600
Get back here.

673
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:05,800
Some racket you got here.
Money and sex.

674
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,200
This is not a racket. These are real
people with real feelings.

675
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:12,100
They need me. I'm their teacher.
And I need them too.

676
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:16,600
It's called a symbiotic relationship.
You wouldn't know about that.

677
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,700
Have a good day. Nice practice.

678
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,500
Excuse me, K.C.,
do you give private lessons?

679
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,900
I don't. If you talk to Kimberly,
then we'll set something up.

680
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:27,100
Okay, thank you.

681
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:30,100
K.C., thank you. I feel really...

682
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,200
...open.

683
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,200
That's a good thing, okay?

684
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,800
See you later.

685
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,200
Great class.

686
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,900
Thanks, Shawna.

687
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,500
Okay.

688
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,600
Maybe I got into it for the sex.

689
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:59,500
But it's not about that anymore.
I mean, this spiritual shit...

690
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:01,500
...there's really something to it.

691
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:04,600
I mean,
I'm out of my body sometimes, man.

692
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:05,800
Seriously.

693
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,600
I mean, this stuff really works.

694
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:11,800
And then these girls come in.
And, I mean, they're everywhere.

695
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:16,100
It's spiritual.

696
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,200
- Deep.
- And shallow.

697
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,300
Deep and shallow.

698
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:26,200
This is why I came.
It's the report on your dad's shooting.

699
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,400
Gavilan.

700
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,800
Gower and Franklin.

701
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,400
Thanks for understanding, Joe.

702
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,200
What's up, Cleo?

703
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,400
- Have you talked to Vice?
- No, I haven't.

704
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:45,100
Not gonna talk to Vice
till I talk to your girl.

705
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:49,300
- You'll have to give me a name.
- My girl is ready to talk.

706
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,500
I've heard that before.

707
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:54,200
She says she was working
a Sartain Records party.

708
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,900
Overheard some guy smoking crack
start bragging.

709
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,800
About what?

710
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:04,100
The people behind the Klepto murder
were also behind the H2OKlick hit.

711
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,300
That's hearsay.

712
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,900
Hearsay to you,
pillow talk to the DA.

713
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:12,000
- You want a deal?
- I don't know.

714
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,600
Give me a call tomorrow,
I'll run it by the DA.

715
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:19,900
- This girl better be for real.
- Look, I gotta make this work.

716
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,900
Things are getting ugly.

717
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,900
I hear you.

718
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:30,500
{y:i}What we got on Gavilan so far?

719
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,100
First of all,
he's still seeing Cleo Ricard.

720
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:36,500
- In fact, he saw her earlier today.
- God, it's right in my face.

721
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:38,200
He's just completely defiant.

722
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,000
He's clearly continuing to work her
as an informant.

723
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,800
That's enough to relieve him
of duty right there.

724
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,800
I don't want him relieved of duty.
I want him to hang.

725
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,600
His financials don't add up.

726
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,300
He's paying off three ex-wives.
He's got two kids.

727
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:55,500
Two kids in a fancy college. He's got a
great big house and a big, stupid car.

728
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:58,000
I mean,
what about his real-estate thing?

729
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,700
He hasn't made a sale in ages.

730
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:03,700
My source tells me he's getting money
from somewhere to keep it afloat.

731
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,400
- So get me more surveillance.
- Okay.

732
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:07,700
Alrighty.

733
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:47,200
- Dominique?
- Close enough.

734
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:42,200
- Where'd you get the key?
- Under the flowerpot.

735
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:54,000
How'd you know it was
under the flowerpot?

736
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,000
I'm psychic.

737
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,100
Good security for a cop.

738
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,300
Bad cop.

739
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,800
No doughnut.

740
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:36,100
- Everything okay?
- Oh, yeah.

741
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:38,800
Everything's fine.

742
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,900
Just a tough case, that's all.

743
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:49,900
Used to have a feel
for a case early on.

744
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,200
Thank you.

745
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,700
So you really...

746
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,900
...think you can
predict the future, huh?

747
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,400
How's that work?

748
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:11,300
Sometimes I see things.
It just comes to me.

749
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,400
And sometimes I flip a coin.

750
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:16,800
Other times...

751
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,900
...I just make shit up.

752
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:25,100
Happy anniversary.

753
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,100
What anniversary?

754
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:30,600
You and me.

755
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:33,000
Three weeks.

756
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,800
That is so sweet.

757
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,100
You remembered.

758
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:39,200
I didn't.

759
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:42,500
I mean, dates don't really matter,
except they do.

760
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:46,000
We think human time,
but rocks think geologic time.

761
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,600
Do you understand what I'm saying?

762
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,600
I don't.

763
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:57,500
The only date that matters is the day
I found you and left that jerk.

764
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:01,300
Does he know it's over?

765
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,400
Bennie's in denial.

766
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:08,100
He's hanging on like a mongoose.
It's sad, really.

767
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:10,300
Bennie?

768
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:13,500
Macko. You don't know him.
He's not in your division.

769
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:15,800
Bennie Macko?

770
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:20,300
- Bennie "The Executioner" Macko?
- That sounds like my Bennie.

771
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:23,300
He's the guy who's trying to bury me,
for chrissake!

772
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:25,900
- Does he know about us?
- Of course not.

773
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:28,100
And who cares?
It's over, we're finished.

774
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:32,900
Guys aren't like that, honey.
Guys keep score!

775
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,300
Gavilan.

776
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,100
Yeah, Jerry...

777
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:41,700
Mr. Duran.

778
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:47,200
Yeah, I can do that.

779
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,500
Okay.

780
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,700
Get the buyer and the seller
inches away from closing...

781
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:59,900
...and this guy wants...

782
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:01,300
...breakfast.

783
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:05,500
That could be great, honey. Mercury's
not in retrograde for another week.

784
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:09,900
It's good time for deal-making.
It's perfect time.

785
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,800
What did you ever see in...

786
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,500
...Bennie Macko?

787
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:20,800
I guess I just have
a weakness for cops.

788
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:25,600
Lock up when you leave.

789
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,500
What have we here?

790
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,200
Oh, my!

791
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,600
Nice shoes.

792
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:53,700
- Good morning, Mr. Duran, Julius.
- Good morning. Have a seat.

793
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,300
This is my attorney, Marty Wheeler...

794
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:00,500
...who just happens to be Julius'
attorney as well. Small world.

795
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:03,500
A conflict of interest?

796
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:05,500
Not for me.

797
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:07,200
Okay, let's talk.

798
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:10,500
Julius was ready
to go to 6.3 or 6.4...

799
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:12,700
...and you drove the price down
to 6.

800
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:15,700
Wait a second. You wanted 5.8.
Six is a score.

801
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:19,400
- You never told me 5.8 would do it.
- I was negotiating.

802
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:20,900
For whom?

803
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:23,500
Look, you wanted 5.8.
I was about to get you 6.

804
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:27,100
- He was ready to go to 6.4.
- Maybe 6.5.

805
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:29,700
But you said the price was 7.
It never was.

806
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:32,900
Look, guys, calm down.
This is a good deal for both of you.

807
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,700
The deal's off. I want 7 million.

808
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,500
Seven?

809
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:40,300
- Seven?
- Yeah.

810
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,900
I won't go a penny over 6.5.

811
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:46,900
Good day, gents.

812
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,800
Asshole!

813
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:00,200
{y:i}I was that close to closing the deal
{y:i}when Duran starts dicking around...{y}{y}

814
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,000
...and blows the whole thing.

815
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:04,200
Getting excited never
solved any problems.

816
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:08,600
How many girls are waiting in line for
the hot tub? That's a problem for you.

817
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:12,200
Joe, you don't respect me wanting
to be an actor, do you?

818
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,700
I just don't get it.

819
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:18,300
Don't you ever want to explore
all the possibilities of who you are?

820
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:22,500
I just want to pay the mortgage and
escape with my dick attached to me.

821
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:25,700
It's that one over there.
I'm a simple man. Go around behind.

822
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:27,700
- I'll give you a second.
- Okay.

823
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,600
Take the front.

824
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:51,900
Ms. Robidoux? Police!

825
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:55,100
Just want to ask you a few questions.

826
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,700
I always thought you could sing
better than Tammi Terrell.

827
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:04,200
She got the breaks. I didn't.
That's life.

828
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,200
Mind if I come in?

829
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:15,800
Jesus Christ.

830
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:19,400
Joe, he's around front!
Joe, he's coming around front!

831
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:23,800
I got him!

832
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,200
He didn't do anything!

833
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,600
Ms. Robidoux.

834
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,300
Hey!

835
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:44,400
I ain't did shit, cop!

836
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:48,100
Why you come to my mama house?
I ain't been to your mama house!

837
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,500
Fuck!

838
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,500
Jesus Christ, man!

839
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:05,200
- Get out of the water!
- Wait.

840
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:08,200
- Don't make me come in.
- I'm knee-deep in duck shit.

841
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,700
- There's two feet of duck shit.
- That's fine.

842
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:13,400
- Get out of the water!
- What you gonna do, shoot me?

843
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:16,300
He wants to shoot an unarmed nigger.

844
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:19,800
- Get out, man. You're under arrest.
- I didn't do nothing!

845
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,800
Get out of the water!

846
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:58,300
Fuck.

847
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:02,900
Hey!

848
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:14,800
Too slow, cop!

849
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,700
Hey!

850
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,400
Christ!

851
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,700
Right or left?
Pick a way, I'm gonna catch you.

852
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:27,600
Never gonna catch me, cop!

853
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:30,000
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

854
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:42,900
Stay right! Stay... Sorry,
your right! Your right, please!

855
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:47,500
All right!

856
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:49,100
Police brutality!

857
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:52,500
Don't swear!
It's not nice.

858
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,200
Settle down!

859
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:58,800
You got him.
See where that got you!

860
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:03,600
You're still caught and you got shit
all over you! How do you like that?

861
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,200
- Center yourself.
- I'm calm, okay?

862
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:07,900
- All right.
- I'm calm!

863
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:09,900
Get up!

864
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,100
You young-ass brat.

865
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:15,500
If it wasn't for this old man,
you wouldn't have caught nothing!

866
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:19,400
Even if you had roller skates. I can't
believe I let your old ass catch me.

867
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,500
- Talk to us.
- L.A.P. D:

868
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:25,300
- Lame-ass, punk-ass dickheads.
- Settle down, son.

869
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,500
- L.A.P.D.
- Settle down.

870
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:31,800
I ain't no snitch and I ain't no bitch.
I ain't got to tell you shit.

871
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:34,500
You are just talking yourself
into a hole.

872
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:37,100
- Take my cuffs off. I'll kick your ass!
- Really...?

873
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:40,600
Will you shut up? Shut up!

874
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,100
I ain't did shit, man.

875
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:45,000
All right, that's it! That's it!

876
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:48,100
Let's take this sucker
to the station, partner, huh?

877
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:49,700
Harbor Division Substation.

878
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:51,700
Crooked-ass police.

879
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:55,400
I'm gonna call Johnnie Cochran,
Chemical Ali, Robert Shapiro.

880
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:57,500
One of them.
Wait till I call my mama.

881
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:01,100
It's gonna be whack, man...
What is this, man?

882
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:03,300
This is Harbor Division, son.

883
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:07,000
Nice, quiet place.
We can reason together.

884
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,200
Here we are.

885
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:14,300
Harbor Division.

886
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,900
This don't look like
no police station.

887
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,100
- Get him out of the car!
- My pleasure.

888
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:21,700
- Get him out.
- This don't look like no...

889
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:23,800
- Get out.
- This ain't no police station.

890
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:29,100
Yeah, this is a special station
for special assholes.

891
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:53,200
Hey! Not again.

892
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,200
- Come back here. Come on.
- Goddamn!

893
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:57,400
You okay?

894
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,000
Yeah, I'm okay. You?

895
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:00,500
Okay.

896
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:02,100
Any opportunity, right?

897
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:05,900
Somebody doesn't like you.
You're no fun to be around!

898
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,600
- You all right?
- Somebody wants you dead.

899
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:11,300
- He okay?
- He's okay, he just pissed his pants.

900
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:14,200
- I wanna talk to my mama.
- You're the man.

901
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:16,200
You got nothing on my boy.

902
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,900
We've got a puddle of piss
at the crime scene...

903
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:22,400
...and your son has a weak bladder.
- And what does that mean?

904
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:26,800
That means we take your son to the
station, we ask him what he saw.

905
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,700
He answers,
we book him into custody, he lives.

906
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:33,300
He doesn't, we let him go, he dies!

907
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:36,200
He didn't do it.
And he ain't getting involved.

908
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:39,500
All right, uncuff him.
Let the jackals hunt him down.

909
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:42,200
- Man, what I'm talking about...
- Hey, stop, stop.

910
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,100
Stop.

911
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:49,800
The young men that got shot...

912
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,400
...all were rappers since they were
little boys on the street corner.

913
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:59,200
And they all wanted to be with
Antoine Sartain and Sartain Records.

914
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,300
That was their Motown.

915
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:04,600
- I don't get the music.
- You ain't supposed to.

916
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,700
After a few albums,
they want to go out on their own.

917
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:10,400
They find out the producer's
keeping all the money.

918
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:13,300
The way it's always gonna be
in the music business.

919
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,700
Sartain goes to the joint
for a while.

920
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:19,900
Klepto, the first to rebel,
tells Sartain:

921
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:21,500
"I'm gonna hire a lawyer...

922
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:24,300
...to get out of my contract
I signed in high school."

923
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,500
Sartain get out of jail.

924
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:31,800
You know what happened next.

925
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:42,200
You telling me Sartain
had his own groups killed...

926
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,500
...because they wanted
to go on their own?

927
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,400
Makes a powerful statement...

928
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:49,500
...to anybody thinking
about breaking a contract.

929
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:51,200
Don't it?

930
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,500
I told you what the picture
looks like.

931
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:59,800
You have to put the pieces together
your own self.

932
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:03,500
We'll take care of your son
for you, ma'am.

933
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:10,000
Antoine Sartain. He was a busy guy
in the gangster network.

934
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:13,100
Had a lot of contacts on the outside.
The music guy, right?

935
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:14,300
Big time.

936
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:17,000
He was smooth,
but he was a psycho.

937
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:18,600
The guy was wired.

938
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,900
He had this attitude, like
he could get anything he wanted.

939
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,500
Any contacts, friends?

940
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,800
A white dude came to visit him
every week he was here.

941
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:28,500
For a whole year without fail.

942
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,400
- Got a name?
- Yeah.

943
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:32,400
What was the name
of the white dude?

944
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:35,000
He came to visit Sartain every week.

945
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:37,900
Wasley. Leroy Wasley.

946
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:40,600
Leroy Wasley?

947
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:46,900
"Officer Calden and his partner,
Officer Leroy Wasley...

948
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:51,200
...working undercover cocaine buy.
A standoff developed.

949
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:55,700
Suspect demanded to see the cash.
Calden demanded to see the cocaine.

950
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:01,500
Officer Calden was shot twice
in the chest.

951
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,700
Suspect got away with $100,000.

952
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:08,800
Some suspicion that Officer Wasley...

953
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,000
...may be involved
with the drug dealers."

954
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:14,500
If the feds thought
Wasley was dirty...

955
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:17,300
...why would they let him back up
my dad on a deal?

956
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,200
Because they couldn't prove it,
I guess.

957
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,800
"After an exhaustive
four-month investigation...

958
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,100
...the case against Officer Wasley
was dropped...

959
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:28,400
...due to a lack of evidence."

960
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:33,700
Joe, I want to kill him.

961
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:37,100
Easy. Easy.

962
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:40,500
There's a real can of worms here.

963
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:43,300
"Wasley wasn't the only backup.

964
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:45,900
There were three uniformed officers
in the alley.

965
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,100
Two of them took off
after the suspect.

966
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:51,800
One of them...

967
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:55,600
...came into the room to find out..."
Oh, my God!

968
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,300
Look at this name.

969
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:03,100
Bernard Macko.

970
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:06,900
- Bennie Macko?
- Bennie Macko.

971
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:10,300
Wasley and Macko.
Macko and Wasley.

972
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:14,400
Something's going on here.

973
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,900
Oh, God. I gotta be somewhere.
You okay?

974
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:23,200
Yeah, I'm good. Go ahead.

975
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:25,300
Take it easy.

976
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,400
Hey, Rubes.
Look, IA's on my ass.

977
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:38,600
Grab some takeout,
meet me at Mt. Olympus.

978
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,500
I don't want to go to the house.

979
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,400
Rube?

980
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:26,400
Ruby, where are you?

981
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:30,400
Rube?

982
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:38,300
Oh, dear.
Detective, you found me.

983
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:41,200
You're under arrest, young lady.

984
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:46,700
Please don't put the cuffs on me.

985
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:55,500
You have the right to remain silent.
You understand?

986
01:14:56,100 --> 01:15:00,500
Gavilan with Marty Wheeler, attorney
from the music business. Sleazeball.

987
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:04,300
Here's Gavilan drinking on duty.
We've got photos, date, time-stamped.

988
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,300
This is not criminal.

989
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:07,900
I need criminal shit.

990
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:12,100
Well, boss, this may not be
criminal shit, but...

991
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:26,000
- What is this?
- "Nice house."

992
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,200
You think so?

993
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,900
That's Gavilan's house.

994
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,800
That's his front porch.

995
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,400
It's a classic...

996
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:40,200
...whose time hasn't come.

997
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:43,200
And her car was there all night.

998
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,300
Where is he now?

999
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:55,600
We lost him.

1000
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:57,100
Where's she?

1001
01:15:57,300 --> 01:16:00,200
This is a very romantic idea.

1002
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,100
- You're a stud.
- No.

1003
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,400
My partner's a stud.

1004
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:10,100
But I've got a few...

1005
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:13,500
...veteran moves.

1006
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:20,900
If I take my ginkgo...

1007
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,100
...I can still remember
where I put the Viagra.

1008
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:31,100
You really like this house?

1009
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:35,100
I'll offer you 675
and not a penny more.

1010
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:37,100
Collateral?

1011
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:39,300
You're looking at it.

1012
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,800
Sgt. Gavilan,
we're taking you downtown.

1013
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:20,400
What a night.

1014
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:22,900
Just one question, asshole.

1015
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:25,600
Why me?
You got no probable cause.

1016
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:29,100
- I'm a good cop.
- Yeah.

1017
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:46,200
You have the right to remain silent.

1018
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:46,900
You have the right to remain silent.

1019
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,400
Here we go, Joe.

1020
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:52,500
You have the right to have an
attorney during questioning.

1021
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:54,200
- You understand?
- Yes.

1022
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:56,800
I do understand the rights
you've explained to me.

1023
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,400
But you know what,
I'm not gonna remain silent...

1024
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:04,400
...and I do not need an attorney
because this is all bullshit!

1025
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,600
And you can put that on the record!

1026
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,400
There's absolutely no need
to take your tie off...

1027
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:11,400
...during questioning, Mr. Calden.

1028
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,600
Why's he taking his shoes off?

1029
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:16,200
- I've got questions for you.
- Questions for me.

1030
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,600
I got questions for you.
My first is:

1031
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:22,700
How does a lightweight, needle-dick
pencil pusher get assigned to IA?

1032
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:25,000
Oh, he's up on the table.

1033
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,100
- What is he doing?
- He's on the table.

1034
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:30,600
This conversation's being recorded.
This will reflect very badly...

1035
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,800
Excuse me.
Gavilan.

1036
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,500
What, he's got a phone?

1037
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:37,500
Jerry! Slow down, Jerry.

1038
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:41,600
- Excuse me!
- I'm busy here.

1039
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:44,500
Okay. He's "oming."

1040
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,800
There are some discrepancies
with your income and your spending.

1041
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,200
You mean, like, I'm spending
more than I'm making?

1042
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:52,300
Is that news?

1043
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:53,700
Keep talking.

1044
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:56,200
I think he's centering.
He's finding his center.

1045
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:59,200
Gavilan.

1046
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:00,900
What the...? What is this?

1047
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:03,700
Julius, calm down, Julius.
It's not over.

1048
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:05,300
Julius, it's never over.

1049
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:06,900
Get him off the phone!

1050
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:08,400
Guys?

1051
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:11,300
Gavilan. Cleo.

1052
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:14,000
- Police business.
- "Joe?"

1053
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:16,900
I can't talk.
I'll call you back later, all right?

1054
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:21,100
Gavilan.

1055
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,400
Hey, Ruby.

1056
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:27,600
What is going on in...?

1057
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:31,400
Muscles, man. I mean, that's...

1058
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:32,600
Make him talk!

1059
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:38,000
I have got the most intense
compression of the L4 and L5.

1060
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:42,100
We have allegations
of commingling of funds.

1061
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:46,400
I've been told that some yoga
and some massage is really...

1062
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,900
Oh, yoga, yoga, yoga.
That's great.

1063
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:51,700
You can't hold out for 7.
Jerry, 7...

1064
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:54,300
That's great!
I think that's enough. I'm sorry.

1065
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:57,400
We're that close, Jerry.

1066
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:58,600
Jerry?

1067
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:00,900
That looks really hard.

1068
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:05,500
His position.
His position looks really hard...

1069
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:08,100
He's not even...
He's not even talking, is he?

1070
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:10,200
...to do.

1071
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,500
A tree?

1072
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:17,700
Now he's a tree?

1073
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:21,300
This is a setup.
And it will not hold up!

1074
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,500
I'm sure Gavilan is
next door right now...

1075
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:26,000
...maintaining complete
professional integrity.

1076
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:28,100
And you know it!

1077
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:31,300
What the hell is going on?
Did you say anything in there?

1078
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:34,300
- Of course not. You?
- My phone wouldn't stop ringing.

1079
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:36,300
Joe, K.C.!

1080
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:40,200
This is insane.
Can you figure this out?

1081
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:41,900
No!

1082
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:46,800
But I played my last card buying you
a couple of hours, so you figure it out!

1083
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:57,500
What did you want
to talk to me about?

1084
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:01,300
- I like you, Joe.
- Don't bullshit me.

1085
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:04,800
You didn't talk to Vice,
so I made a deal with them.

1086
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,800
- What are you talking about?
- They agreed to back off...

1087
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,500
...if I agree to testify.

1088
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:12,500
- Testify against whom?
- You.

1089
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:16,700
I was approached by Lt. Macko.

1090
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:21,400
Said he heard that you and I
were involved sexually.

1091
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:27,500
And maybe you and some of my girls
had, you know, relationships.

1092
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:31,200
The kid too.

1093
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:34,500
I don't know what you did
to piss Macko off...

1094
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:37,400
...but he cut me a deal
and I took it.

1095
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:41,700
And you're telling me this
because you like me, huh?

1096
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:43,900
Yeah, Joe.

1097
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:46,200
I thought you should know.

1098
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:57,000
Fuck! Bitch!

1099
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:06,100
- Gavilan.
- "Joe, listen".

1100
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:09,000
Bennie's going to the DA right now,
not even waiting.

1101
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:13,400
{y:i}And the stakeout at Sartain's house
{y:i}says he hasn't been seen in 24 hours.{y}{y}{y}{y}{y}

1102
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,500
And he hasn't been
at Sartain Records.

1103
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,200
Thanks.

1104
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:20,000
- What?
- This guy, Sartain.

1105
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,200
I don't even know where to find him.

1106
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:24,600
Wait a second.

1107
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:26,800
I got one idea.

1108
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,500
Hey, Rube.

1109
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:34,000
You ever done any psychic work
for the police?

1110
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:37,800
You gonna be home
for the next half-hour? Great.

1111
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:39,500
What are you laughing at?

1112
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:57,700
- It's gonna work.
- This is ridiculous.

1113
01:22:57,900 --> 01:22:59,500
Joe, be quiet, please.

1114
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:05,500
What are you doing?

1115
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:10,700
I'm getting centered,
and if you don't leave me alone...

1116
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:12,400
Leave her alone for a second.

1117
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:15,800
Flip a coin, make some shit up.
I don't care.

1118
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:18,300
Sorry.

1119
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:21,400
Continue, please.

1120
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:40,400
There's a house on Sunset Plaza.

1121
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:41,500
Yes?

1122
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:45,900
But nobody's there.

1123
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:47,700
Okay.

1124
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:51,400
We must move quickly.

1125
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:55,300
Move quickly.

1126
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,700
- Turn right.
- Right?

1127
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:04,800
I see Rodeo Drive.

1128
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:07,900
- What happened to Sunset Plaza?
- Give her a break, Joe.

1129
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:10,500
We're getting close.

1130
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:12,800
Hold on, hold on. We're here.

1131
01:24:12,900 --> 01:24:14,100
- Here?
- Here, yeah.

1132
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:15,400
- Okay.
- Here?

1133
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:17,000
We're here.

1134
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:22,900
Here.

1135
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:25,000
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1136
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:30,700
- In here.
- You sure?

1137
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:32,300
Shut up.

1138
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:36,100
- Welcome to Beverly Hills...
- I am not in the mood.

1139
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:41,900
That would look so great on me.

1140
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,900
Ruby! How nice to see you!

1141
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,900
I love that. How much is it?

1142
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:49,500
- Don't worry.
- That is cute.

1143
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:52,600
She's shopping.

1144
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,500
Let her shop.

1145
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:56,400
We have it in black and purple.

1146
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:58,800
I'm out of here.

1147
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Goddamn it, Joe!

1148
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:03,300
- Do you have that in size 2?
- Yes, we do. But we also have...

1149
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,700
This is ridiculous.

1150
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:08,900
You gotta give her some space.
We got nothing else to go on.

1151
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:16,300
- Sartain! Right there in the black SUV!
- Get the car!

1152
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:17,500
Go!

1153
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,200
Move it!

1154
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:22,000
- Keys.
- Yeah, they're in there.

1155
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:23,700
Hey! Hey!

1156
01:25:23,900 --> 01:25:26,200
- Come on!
- Hey, stop!

1157
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:27,800
Stop, damn it!

1158
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:34,800
- You owe me $10.
- I'll give it to you later.

1159
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,700
Hey, stop!

1160
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:47,000
Stop, goddamn it!

1161
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:49,200
- Go! Go!
- You good?

1162
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:51,000
I'm going!

1163
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:54,200
Don't speed. You're in Beverly Hills.

1164
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:56,600
Goddamn it, I don't want a ticket!

1165
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:59,300
- Here we are.
- There he is!

1166
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,500
- Jesus. Don't do this.
- Out of the way!

1167
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:12,600
- This is...
- Out of the way!

1168
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:18,100
Okay. Get out of the way!

1169
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:23,900
That's him, Danny.

1170
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:25,300
Right here. Turn!

1171
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:29,400
- Out of the car!
- Easy, boss.

1172
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:31,300
- Get out of the car!
- Hey, I quit!

1173
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:35,100
Damn it!

1174
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:42,300
Joe, you all right?

1175
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:45,700
Son of a bitch!
Come on! Go! Go!

1176
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:58,200
Stay with him.

1177
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:01,100
I am not going back to prison
on this bullshit!

1178
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:07,200
- Get out of the way!
- Jesus Christ. Stop!

1179
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:12,100
- Police! Get out! Move the truck!
- Get out of the way!

1180
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:13,500
Move it!

1181
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:15,200
- God.
- Jesus Christ!

1182
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:17,300
If it's not one thing,
it's another.

1183
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:22,900
This is Gavilan.

1184
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:28,200
In pursuit of possible 187 suspects.
Black Escalade, eastbound on Sunset.

1185
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:32,200
{y:i}While flying over the Hollywood
{y:i}Freeway, we hear about a chase...{y}{y}{y}{y}{y}

1186
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,100
{y:i}... on Sunset Boulevard.

1187
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:37,200
If you're driving in Hollywood
heading to Mid-Wilshire...

1188
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:39,600
{y:i}... and Beverly Hills,
{y:i}I suggest you stay away.{y}{y}{y}{y}{y}

1189
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:41,800
{y:i}The police need you
{y:i}out of the area.{y}{y}{y}{y}{y}

1190
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:53,600
- Get down!
- Watch!

1191
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:59,100
- Gavilan.
- Are you okay?

1192
01:27:59,300 --> 01:28:00,600
{y:i}Yeah. Honey, we had to go.

1193
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:03,200
That guy showed up across the street.
There...

1194
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:04,400
I know.

1195
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:08,900
- Look, I gotta go. I'll talk to you soon.
- Take care.

1196
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:12,700
{y:i}We got two more black
{y:i}and whites on the chase.{y}{y}{y}{y}{y}

1197
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:16,900
In pursuit of a silver Mustang,
black Escalade, Sunset Boulevard.

1198
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:19,100
{y:i}Doing about 50 miles an hour.

1199
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:21,200
Who are they chasing,
me or them?

1200
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:24,200
Both of us now!
You just committed three felonies!

1201
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:26,300
Twice!

1202
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:30,100
Gavilan. Yeah, Jerry.

1203
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:31,500
No, I can talk.

1204
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:35,100
Six... You'll take 6.9 now?

1205
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:37,900
I don't know, it might be too late.
I'll make a call.

1206
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:50,700
No. Go, go! Cut over!

1207
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:53,600
Get out of the way!

1208
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:56,700
Sorry.

1209
01:28:56,900 --> 01:28:59,300
Let me know when you're back
on the street.

1210
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:00,900
Don't worry.

1211
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:04,100
{y:i}Air Six, be advised,
{y:i}we're getting crowded up here.{y}{y}{y}{y}{y}

1212
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:05,700
A lot of choppers in the sky.

1213
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:09,400
It is not just crazy in the streets.
It is crazy up in the air.

1214
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:13,300
We have one, two, three.
I see Vera, Jennifer, York.

1215
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:14,600
I see Lauren, Vera.

1216
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:22,200
- Get a deal on that house yet?
- Dicking me around, but I'm on it.

1217
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:25,700
Get out of the way!

1218
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:27,800
- Get out...
- Watch!

1219
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,400
I'm watching! I'm watching!

1220
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:36,400
Julius, he says he'll take 6.9 now.

1221
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:39,100
That's what he says.

1222
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:42,800
Let me make a call. Bye.

1223
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:52,400
- Get out!
- Watch! Get off Sunset!

1224
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:54,600
- Go! Go!
- I got them.

1225
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:06,900
Is that Joe Gavilan?

1226
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:14,200
They'll try to travel
up to Hollywood Boulevard...

1227
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:17,600
...where a huge crowd is in front of
Grauman's Chinese Theatre.

1228
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:21,800
{y:i}I don't know what's going on there,
{y:i}but this is a very dangerous situation.{y}{y}{y}{y}{y}

1229
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:26,600
We'll honor him in one of the most
famous traditions here in Hollywood.

1230
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:29,700
Watch it!

1231
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:50,900
Goddamn it! Idiot!

1232
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:53,000
That's it! I'm driving! That's it!

1233
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:55,600
All right. Fine!
You think you can do better?

1234
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:57,000
Go ahead. Be my guest!

1235
01:30:57,100 --> 01:31:01,100
- Damn it! You're trying to kill me! Idiot!
- Come on! Go!

1236
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:04,400
- Kill me.
- Go ahead.

1237
01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:14,800
This is a tradition
that started back in 1927...

1238
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:18,400
...when a little dog named Zorro...

1239
01:31:18,700 --> 01:31:20,600
Yeah, this is much better. Thank you.

1240
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:23,000
...jumped out of Mary Pickford's car...

1241
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,300
...into wet cement.

1242
01:31:34,700 --> 01:31:37,600
- Nice driving.
- Sorry.

1243
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:41,400
The Mustang was hit by the Escalade
and this chase came to a halt...

1244
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:43,600
{y:i}... in front of Grauman's Theatre...

1245
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:46,100
{y:i}... where someone was getting
{y:i}their star.{y}{y}{y}{y}{y}

1246
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:58,400
I got Wasley!

1247
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:01,000
Get out of the way!

1248
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:04,000
Get down! Get out of the way!

1249
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,800
Police! Police! Stay down!

1250
01:32:10,700 --> 01:32:13,900
Mayhem is breaking out,
resulting in a foot pursuit.

1251
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,800
{y:i}They're running
{y:i}down Hollywood Blvd.{y}{y}{y}{y}{y}

1252
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
{y:i}They've got their weapons drawn.
"We've"...{y}{y}{y}{y}{y}

1253
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:23,100
People are scrambling out of the way.
Everyone's running. It's a mess.

1254
01:32:23,300 --> 01:32:25,700
Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

1255
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:41,700
Look out down there!

1256
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,500
Holy shit!

1257
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:52,900
Oh, God!

1258
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:56,000
That was not the way I planned it.

1259
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:58,700
I'm a cop. Help me up.

1260
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:01,700
Thank you.

1261
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,100
I'm okay. I'm all right. Thank you.

1262
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:08,200
Hey, move, move. Move!

1263
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:12,000
Hey! Get out of the way! Police!

1264
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:14,000
- Get out!
- Hey, stop!

1265
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:15,600
Hey!

1266
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:18,500
Stop!

1267
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:22,000
Shit! Hey, police.
Get out of your car.

1268
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:24,400
- What the hell?
- I need your car.

1269
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:26,500
- I'll get it back to you.
- My family's...

1270
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:29,900
Hey, come on!
Police! Somebody help me!

1271
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:36,700
Watch out! Police!

1272
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:39,200
Get out of the way!
Watch out! Police!

1273
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:41,200
Police!

1274
01:34:11,700 --> 01:34:12,900
You need to slow down.

1275
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:16,400
I can't slow down, ma'am. I'm sorry.
I'm chasing this guy here.

1276
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:19,400
- It's kind of fun, huh?
- No, it's not!

1277
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:22,700
We're gonna die.
I know we're going to die.

1278
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:24,900
Yes, actually. We will die.

1279
01:34:25,100 --> 01:34:28,700
- No, you're not gonna die.
- I don't mean right now.

1280
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:35,800
Hey! Get out of the car! Police!

1281
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,400
Police! Get out... Hey!

1282
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:39,700
- Hey, look! Come on!
- Get out of here!

1283
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:42,500
- Hey! That's mine!
- Give me that!

1284
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:53,100
- Bitch!
- Asshole!

1285
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:55,800
Move! Police! Move!

1286
01:34:56,900 --> 01:34:58,800
Move over!

1287
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,300
Goddamn it! You all right?

1288
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:06,100
Watch out! Move! Move! Move!

1289
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,600
Hey, kids,
Hindus say that life is a rebirth.

1290
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:16,300
Ganesh had his head chopped off.

1291
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:19,100
They put an elephant's head
on and he lived forever.

1292
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:21,200
- You're crazy!
- Kids, listen to me.

1293
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:24,100
It's not a bad thing
if we do die, all right?

1294
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,800
- Get out of the cab!
- This is my cab!

1295
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,200
My cab! My cab!

1296
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:33,100
No, man, it's my cab. It's my cab!

1297
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:35,600
- Get in the car!
- Police! Police!

1298
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:37,000
I am the police!

1299
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:40,700
For chrissake, get in the cab!
Move! Move!

1300
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:45,400
If you wreck my cab, the city...

1301
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:48,300
Don't worry. Sit back.
I'm a very good driver.

1302
01:36:04,700 --> 01:36:06,700
I don't want to die!

1303
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:09,400
We're not gonna die, all right?

1304
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,100
Shut up, okay? Please!

1305
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:18,400
Oh, my God!

1306
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:34,800
Wait a minute, man.
Where's my fare?

1307
01:36:34,900 --> 01:36:36,900
- How much?
- Ten dollars.

1308
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:41,300
Ten dollars. Ten dollars.
There's a tip!

1309
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,700
Move! Move! Move!

1310
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:33,400
Hey! Hey!

1311
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:47,600
Hey, cop. What about 6.75?

1312
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:50,200
- I don't think that'll do it!
- Not a penny more!

1313
01:38:01,700 --> 01:38:04,500
Get down! Get down!
Get the hell down!

1314
01:38:07,900 --> 01:38:09,300
Get up! In front of the door!

1315
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,400
Get in front of the frigging door!

1316
01:38:14,700 --> 01:38:16,900
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

1317
01:38:27,100 --> 01:38:29,100
What are you doing?

1318
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:40,100
Jerry, I've just been with Julius.
I've twisted his arm.

1319
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:42,500
I have a firm offer for 6.75.

1320
01:38:42,700 --> 01:38:46,200
Yes, sir, 6.75. Firm.

1321
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:51,000
- You will? You will?
- Oh, God.

1322
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:53,100
You will?

1323
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:55,100
That's fantastic.

1324
01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:59,700
I'll start the paperwork in the morning,
soon as I get to the office, okay?

1325
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:03,000
I've gotta run now.
Thank you very much.

1326
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:10,200
I'm a real-estate broker.

1327
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:16,500
Hey.

1328
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:53,700
Yeah, he needs a pop-out trailer,
cook, driver...

1329
01:39:53,900 --> 01:39:58,200
...trainer with a gym that travels,
dog walker, hair and makeup guys.

1330
01:39:58,300 --> 01:40:00,100
I'll fax you the rest of the perks.

1331
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:31,500
- Don't shoot me, man.
- Don't shoot?

1332
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:34,800
Don't shoot me.
Don't shoot, Wasley.

1333
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,800
- Please, don't shoot me.
- Please?

1334
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,900
Are you shitting me? Please?
You're not going to beg.

1335
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,900
- I'm begging. Please!
- Jesus Christ.

1336
01:40:42,100 --> 01:40:45,300
H2O didn't beg. They screamed
and hollered. They didn't beg.

1337
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:48,300
And fat-ass Klepto ran a couple yards.
You can run.

1338
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:51,400
I don't even want to be a cop anymore.
I want to quit.

1339
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:55,200
I won't tell anybody about this,
I swear to God. Please, don't kill me!

1340
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:57,100
I don't want to die, okay?

1341
01:40:57,300 --> 01:40:59,500
But my father...
My father was your partner!

1342
01:40:59,700 --> 01:41:02,200
Just please, God, don't shoot me!
Please!

1343
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:04,300
Shut up.

1344
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:05,900
Don't talk about your father.

1345
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:08,900
Your daddy didn't beg
when he got shot.

1346
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:13,800
- He was a good cop.
- Please, don't shoot.

1347
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:19,800
Don't do it!

1348
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:22,300
Don't do it, Wasley. Don't!

1349
01:41:37,900 --> 01:41:39,900
That was a great performance.

1350
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:42,600
Good enough to be
at least a Golden Globe.

1351
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:45,300
I don't know about an Academy Award,
but a Golden Globe.

1352
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:48,200
I believed it myself.

1353
01:41:48,300 --> 01:41:52,500
I mean, all the, "Don't kill me, man.
Don't freaking kill me."

1354
01:41:54,100 --> 01:41:56,800
I liked where you talked
about killing my father.

1355
01:42:04,300 --> 01:42:06,000
But it's okay.

1356
01:42:06,700 --> 01:42:09,500
'Cause I got it all right here.
See that?

1357
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:16,000
Your confession and my performance,
all on one tape.

1358
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:17,700
That will sell great.

1359
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:23,600
Air Six, suspects are on the roof
of the old Broadway Building.

1360
01:42:23,700 --> 01:42:26,000
{y:i}Shots have been fired.

1361
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:53,700
Air Six, get on the horn and get
these news choppers out of here.

1362
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:56,200
{y:i}I can't work, I need orbit room.
{y:i}Move them back.{y}{y}{y}{y}{y}

1363
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:58,400
He's telling us to get out of the way.

1364
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:01,200
But we're not moving.
We're not.

1365
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:03,500
L.A.P.D. Is trying to kick us
out of here.

1366
01:43:03,700 --> 01:43:06,200
{y:i}We don't know who the good guy,
{y:i}who the bad guy is.{y}{y}{y}{y}{y}

1367
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:09,300
{y:i}I've never seen such drama
{y:i}in Hollywood before.{y}{y}{y}{y}{y}

1368
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:18,200
We're on the roof.

1369
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:37,700
Where is he?

1370
01:45:44,100 --> 01:45:47,000
- You want me to get him out?
- Leave him for the coroner.

1371
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:50,600
- Where's the kid?
- Down that way.

1372
01:45:58,200 --> 01:45:59,800
You okay?

1373
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:03,100
- Yeah. You?
- Don't I look okay?

1374
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:05,100
Where's Sartain?

1375
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,900
And Wasley?

1376
01:46:12,300 --> 01:46:13,400
Good job.

1377
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:20,200
Good thing you didn't kill him.

1378
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:22,500
You know me.
I don't like dead bodies.

1379
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:25,000
I got arrest warrants
for Gavilan and Calden.

1380
01:46:25,300 --> 01:46:26,800
Hey, separate them!

1381
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:30,000
I don't want them talking to anybody
until they get downtown.

1382
01:46:31,100 --> 01:46:32,700
Shut up and turn around, Bennie.

1383
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:34,900
- What?
- Cuff him. Take him downtown.

1384
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
What are you talking about?

1385
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:41,000
Get your hands off me, son of a bitch!
You're making a big mistake, pal.

1386
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:44,800
- You can kiss your career goodbye.
- Good.

1387
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:47,000
Call my lawyer.

1388
01:46:53,700 --> 01:46:55,400
Great job.

1389
01:46:56,200 --> 01:46:59,400
You don't have to come tomorrow
if you don't feel up to it.

1390
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:04,400
I said I would be there tomorrow night.
I'll be there, all right?

1391
01:47:04,900 --> 01:47:05,900
All right.

1392
01:47:07,100 --> 01:47:08,500
Damn it!

1393
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:11,900
Drunk, drunk, animal thing, you!

1394
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:14,000
Will all of you please
get out of here?

1395
01:47:14,900 --> 01:47:16,300
If you lay one hand on me...

1396
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:21,500
- My sister's having a baby.
- This is so wrong. Get him out of here.

1397
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:23,800
Let go of me, you sons of bitches!

1398
01:47:25,100 --> 01:47:27,300
Get him in bed,
put a cold towel on his head.

1399
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:29,500
Some coffee would do him good
right now.

1400
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:34,000
- Let's get him into the shower.
- Let go of me, you sons of bitches!

1401
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:39,100
Take it easy.

1402
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:45,600
- Let's get out of here.
- Poker should not be played...

1403
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:47,800
...in a house with women!

1404
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:54,200
Baby.

1405
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:02,100
Eunice, I want my baby girl down here.

1406
01:48:02,300 --> 01:48:04,500
I'm just going to keep on calling,
if you...

1407
01:48:04,700 --> 01:48:06,300
Hey.

1408
01:48:11,900 --> 01:48:14,000
Stella!

1409
01:48:14,300 --> 01:48:15,500
Stella!

1410
01:48:15,700 --> 01:48:17,800
Quit howling out there.
Go back to bed!

1411
01:48:18,100 --> 01:48:19,900
Eunice, send my baby girl down here!

1412
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:24,000
She ain't coming down till you quit
or they'll set the law on you.

1413
01:48:24,200 --> 01:48:26,300
- Come here.
- You can't beat up a girl...

1414
01:48:26,700 --> 01:48:29,000
...and expect her to come back!
- You suck.

1415
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:31,500
Sit down.

1416
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:33,800
Have some respect
or I'll kick your ass.

1417
01:48:33,900 --> 01:48:36,100
Stella, come down here, baby.

1418
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:41,200
- Like they did last time.
- Eunice, send my baby girl down here.

1419
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:01,400
Yeah. It's Calden.

1420
01:49:05,700 --> 01:49:08,100
- Gavilan.
- Yeah. I'll be there in 15.

1421
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:10,600
West of Coldwater?

1422
01:49:11,100 --> 01:49:12,100
I can be there in 10.

1423
01:49:16,900 --> 01:49:20,400
Stella. Oh, baby,
don't ever leave me again.

1424
01:49:39,100 --> 01:49:40,900
- Hey, officer, help me out?
- Yeah.

1425
01:49:41,100 --> 01:49:43,500
- What's going on?
- Looks like you got a 187.

1426
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:46,400
- Possible 927D.
- Thanks a lot.

1427
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:50,900
He says we have a body and a half
with some pieces missing.

1428
01:49:51,100 --> 01:49:53,300
An Easter egg hunt.

1429
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:56,400
You were pretty good in that play.
You really were.

1430
01:49:56,600 --> 01:49:58,200
You think so?

1431
01:49:58,500 --> 01:50:00,700
Yeah.

1432
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:03,300
I don't know if I'm much of an actor.

1433
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:07,300
- I think I'm just a cop.
- What do you mean, just a cop?

1434
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:09,000
You really thought I was good?

1435
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:13,300
Hey, I already said you were good.
Don't go begging me.

1436
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:15,300
Looks like we'll be here a while.

1437
01:50:15,500 --> 01:50:17,800
Let's get going on some chow, huh?

1438
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:22,000
Cheeseburger, well-done,
onion, pickle, no mayo.

1439
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:26,300
- No rabbit food, okay?
- I'll have the same.

1440
01:50:27,305 --> 01:50:33,411
