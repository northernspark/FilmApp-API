2
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:50,893
Shit.

3
00:01:00,842 --> 00:01:01,342
Hey.

4
00:01:01,735 --> 00:01:02,361
Hey.

5
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,871
Are late, is the
second time this week.

6
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:02,843
- Not so bad.
- Yes, you better come quickly.

7
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,412
The game is tonight
and we are already late.

8
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:06,329
Realized.

9
00:03:33,869 --> 00:03:34,297
Hello

10
00:03:35,797 --> 00:03:36,941
Forgive me for being so late.

11
00:03:39,823 --> 00:03:41,087
He was my teacher
psychology.

12
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:43,485
- Yes?
- Yes, said the research work ...

13
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:45,989
... It was the best he had seen.

14
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:49,977
It's about baby mice or chimpanzees.

15
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:50,802
Chimpanzee babies.

16
00:03:52,076 --> 00:03:56,095
Hey, seriously, I would be surprised
than they are capable.

17
00:03:57,226 --> 00:03:59,343
Not so pretty
like people.

18
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:00,880
Tell me.

19
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:06,385
Okay?

20
00:04:07,558 --> 00:04:08,918
You know I'm still
worried about it?

21
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:15,898
Actually, I wanted to go. This is part
very important in the ritual of the sport.

22
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:17,900
How can I change this?

23
00:04:33,257 --> 00:04:33,810
Elizabeth.

24
00:04:36,053 --> 00:04:37,510
Hello, I thought it was you.

25
00:04:38,394 --> 00:04:39,509
- Hello, Mike.
- Eddy.

26
00:04:40,999 --> 00:04:42,242
Where are you two?

27
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:45,790
Let the town's Mike
spend the weekend

28
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,190
is a return weekend
at home, so we ...

29
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,085
The team does not need you, Mike?

30
00:04:53,762 --> 00:04:55,636
Just for the weekend ... asshole.

31
00:04:56,309 --> 00:04:56,818
Right.

32
00:04:57,174 --> 00:05:00,024
Oh, did I say that.
There is a feast

33
00:05:00,025 --> 00:05:03,025
of charities,
wondered if he could come.

34
00:05:03,342 --> 00:05:04,355
Oh, that bad.

35
00:05:05,698 --> 00:05:09,454
In fact, we'll be out
the whole weekend, so ...

36
00:05:10,484 --> 00:05:13,416
Great, it's an honor, man.

37
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:14,991
Yes, we're already late, so ...

38
00:05:15,227 --> 00:05:17,505
So ... I see you Monday,
okay?

39
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:19,095
Right.

40
00:05:33,451 --> 00:05:36,989
Welcome to MT. Bliss. City
the State Champion Tigers

41
00:05:42,987 --> 00:05:43,347
Shelby.

42
00:05:44,306 --> 00:05:45,906
- Can I talk to you a second?
- I'm a little busy.

43
00:05:46,417 --> 00:05:47,583
It only takes a minute.

44
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:59,148
Honey, do it all the more enjoyable
possible, but you have to collaborate.

45
00:06:00,747 --> 00:06:02,312
You just have to trust that I will pay.

46
00:06:02,692 --> 00:06:05,946
I think, really, but the bank
need to see some progress.

47
00:06:06,156 --> 00:06:08,107
I said I'll give the bank
... and I will.

48
00:06:09,815 --> 00:06:10,898
It is now ...

49
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:13,594
Look, I'ma tell you one thing.

50
00:06:14,236 --> 00:06:15,549
I'll talk about it with the bank tomorrow?

51
00:06:17,314 --> 00:06:17,925
Okay, Shelby.

52
00:06:18,707 --> 00:06:20,282
Really need to go there this time.

53
00:06:28,774 --> 00:06:31,065
Sorry is that ...
I can not stand aqule type.

54
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:32,926
What the hell have you seen him?

55
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,417
Obviously not enough.
55th
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,730
What about you and your ex-girlfriend?

56
00:06:38,221 --> 00:06:38,694
What was his name?

57
00:06:39,764 --> 00:06:40,263
Shelby?

58
00:06:41,656 --> 00:06:42,427
An ancient history.

59
00:06:43,431 --> 00:06:44,525
No need to worry about it.

60
00:06:44,963 --> 00:06:45,594
Okay.

61
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:46,701
I was just checking.

62
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:07,600
Hello, Billy.

63
00:07:08,131 --> 00:07:08,604
Hello, Shel.

64
00:07:12,596 --> 00:07:14,154
So, suppose that Mickey will
the game tonight.

65
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,580
He is spending the weekend.

66
00:07:17,255 --> 00:07:18,069
Really? I do not know.

67
00:07:18,713 --> 00:07:19,730
Do not be jealous.

68
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:23,644
You know? I know not seen since
he came home last year,

69
00:07:24,197 --> 00:07:27,039
but will have to wait,
because it's my turn.

70
00:07:28,362 --> 00:07:29,454
I thought you had finished.

71
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,115
Yes, we have not seen since
school, but ...

72
00:07:32,928 --> 00:07:36,453
... I still think we can continue,
when it comes to the team and all that.

73
00:07:37,444 --> 00:07:38,613
I wish I had
a girl like that.

74
00:07:38,942 --> 00:07:40,325
Whatever is to have a girl like that.

75
00:07:41,114 --> 00:07:41,700
That is true.

76
00:07:44,138 --> 00:07:46,521
Do I get early, we
press conference.

77
00:07:46,882 --> 00:07:47,956
Okay.
Tigers in front.

78
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:50,050
Yes, in front Tigers.

79
00:08:31,975 --> 00:08:33,137
We have a celebrity in the stadium.

80
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:37,845
Oh, my God.

81
00:08:38,946 --> 00:08:40,247
- Relax.
- It's great to see you.

82
00:08:44,116 --> 00:08:45,966
- Hey, Billy.
- Hello

83
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:47,872
And you should be ...

84
00:08:48,303 --> 00:08:48,834
No, no, no.

85
00:08:49,045 --> 00:08:49,565
Do not tell me.

86
00:08:50,388 --> 00:08:54,573
Sara Elizabeth Mitchum. Born in 1988,
in Illinois. A brother, a sister.

87
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,148
- It's amazing.
- But scary.

88
00:08:57,608 --> 00:08:58,891
No, I have to read the files.

89
00:08:59,108 --> 00:09:00,227
See who's going out with my cousin.

90
00:09:00,921 --> 00:09:02,442
Satisfy me that there is a mad
or whatever.

91
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:05,208
Elizabeth, this is my cousin Billy.

92
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,427
- Nice to know.
- Also.

93
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,117
There is food, I will get
Another thing, okay?

94
00:09:10,327 --> 00:09:11,294
- OK
- Right.

95
00:09:14,457 --> 00:09:14,966
It's beautiful.

96
00:09:16,282 --> 00:09:18,183
Just wanted to see you before the Shelby.

97
00:09:19,485 --> 00:09:21,316
I think she thinks
are still together.

98
00:09:22,023 --> 00:09:24,102
What? C'mon
she was joking.

99
00:09:24,532 --> 00:09:25,410
No, no.
No kidding.

100
00:09:25,994 --> 00:09:27,246
She talks about you all the time.

101
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:30,098
Very healthy.

102
00:09:31,922 --> 00:09:33,538
- Why do not you sit down?
- Yes

103
00:09:34,046 --> 00:09:35,266
Actually, the whole pizza?

104
00:09:35,777 --> 00:09:38,554
- OK, open your wallet ...
- It's so cool.

105
00:09:39,215 --> 00:09:39,829
He is the greatest.

106
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,368
Always wanted to be like him.

107
00:09:41,897 --> 00:09:42,628
- Yes?
- Yes

108
00:09:43,307 --> 00:09:46,073
If it had been in
championship game ...

109
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,917
... had lost.

110
00:10:02,175 --> 00:10:03,678
Hey, Mike. How's life?

111
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:05,811
My brother goes into
basketball team.

112
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:06,912
- Oh yeah?
- Yes, of course.

113
00:10:09,094 --> 00:10:11,077
- Now still real serious?
- Of course it should be, Mike?

114
00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:13,691
Now that is not angry.

115
00:10:14,629 --> 00:10:16,165
I do not want to embarrass him
in front of his girlfriend.

116
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:17,845
Suffice it to say.

117
00:10:20,938 --> 00:10:21,455
Are you sure you want to come?

118
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,331
Maybe go home.

119
00:10:23,778 --> 00:10:24,939
What? At the restaurant?

120
00:10:25,446 --> 00:10:26,404
Yes, come on.

121
00:10:26,796 --> 00:10:28,399
I want to know their friends.
Why can not we go?

122
00:10:31,453 --> 00:10:31,965
See you there.

123
00:10:33,844 --> 00:10:34,290
Come on.

124
00:10:35,705 --> 00:10:36,472
What?

125
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:47,201
Sta You okay?

126
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:48,331
Yes.

127
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:49,789
What's happening?

128
00:10:50,802 --> 00:10:52,655
Nothing, no problem. Just ...

129
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:54,035
Contact Mickey.

130
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:58,397
Well, why do not you know
want to go to Alley, is because,

131
00:10:59,405 --> 00:11:01,093
is the restaurant of my ex-girlfriend.

132
00:11:01,965 --> 00:11:02,645
She is the owner.

133
00:11:02,876 --> 00:11:04,486
Well, his family had,
and now it's her.

134
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,196
Are the owners of the Alley?

135
00:11:07,661 --> 00:11:08,276
Yes.

136
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,057
Well I think ...

137
00:11:10,969 --> 00:11:12,633
Billy told me that she still
think we're together.

138
00:11:16,203 --> 00:11:18,234
Why does she think that?

139
00:11:18,517 --> 00:11:20,332
Me've no idea,
do not talk to her for months.

140
00:11:22,378 --> 00:11:23,013
This is bizarre.

141
00:11:26,195 --> 00:11:27,462
It's not a bad person,
it just ...

142
00:11:28,677 --> 00:11:32,633
It's a little bit ... Just ... It's intense.

143
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:34,904
And you?

144
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:38,630
Look, I understand that.

145
00:11:40,154 --> 00:11:42,446
Do not worry about it.
I've had problems before.

146
00:11:43,863 --> 00:11:44,576
I'll behave.

147
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,957
Hello Mike.
Shelby has not seen it?

148
00:12:15,612 --> 00:12:18,384
She'll be so excited,
're always talking about you.

149
00:12:18,825 --> 00:12:19,456
Hello

150
00:12:20,456 --> 00:12:22,850
She's back there,
You should go talk to her.

151
00:12:26,002 --> 00:12:27,033
It's probably a good idea.

152
00:12:28,842 --> 00:12:29,587
I'll see Billy.

153
00:12:30,855 --> 00:12:32,197
- Give me that.
- Thanks.

154
00:12:34,826 --> 00:12:35,771
Hello

155
00:12:51,683 --> 00:12:52,178
Shel.

156
00:12:54,852 --> 00:12:55,608
Mickey.

157
00:12:58,411 --> 00:12:59,356
Shel, wait, wait.

158
00:13:00,007 --> 00:13:01,373
- Slow.
- How slow?

159
00:13:01,857 --> 00:13:04,451
Since when is like slowly?

160
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:05,923
Shelby, who knows?
Wait.

161
00:13:06,414 --> 00:13:07,174
I felt you so much.

162
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:08,676
Shelby, no.

163
00:13:09,002 --> 00:13:09,401
I can not.

164
00:13:09,988 --> 00:13:10,486
What do you mean?

165
00:13:11,114 --> 00:13:12,236
Know what I mean, Shelby.

166
00:13:12,842 --> 00:13:13,353
We finish.

167
00:13:14,062 --> 00:13:14,625
Remember?

168
00:13:16,473 --> 00:13:19,548
I felt bad after school
and would not live here anymore.

169
00:13:21,477 --> 00:13:22,685
Do not remember that?

170
00:13:23,734 --> 00:13:25,396
But I'm building
an annex in the house.

171
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:29,727
It's enough to get a
family, as you said.

172
00:13:32,844 --> 00:13:33,653
Look, I know this is

173
00:13:34,672 --> 00:13:36,707
difficult for you and know
left her without an explanation,

174
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,708
but do not know what else to do.

175
00:13:42,618 --> 00:13:44,758
Okay, I forgive you.

176
00:13:45,856 --> 00:13:47,791
I mean, I had to
go to another school e. ..

177
00:13:48,434 --> 00:13:50,814
... I was always
problems with my mother e. ..

178
00:13:52,788 --> 00:13:53,525
We can fix that.

179
00:13:53,973 --> 00:13:55,370
Shelby, not listening.

180
00:13:56,051 --> 00:13:56,790
I have a girlfriend.

181
00:13:59,662 --> 00:14:00,719
It is here, outside.

182
00:14:09,238 --> 00:14:11,320
Gotta go,
this was a bad idea.

183
00:14:11,946 --> 00:14:12,487
Sorry, Shelby.

184
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:14,396
I should not have come here.

185
00:14:23,359 --> 00:14:24,061
Hey, Eddie,
what happens?

186
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,264
What?

187
00:14:27,298 --> 00:14:29,188
No, no. Let's discuss
when you return to school.

188
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:32,218
Eddie?

189
00:14:32,877 --> 00:14:33,411
I'm losing you.

190
00:14:35,721 --> 00:14:37,698
Is there anywhere in this city where there
with signal coverage decent?

191
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:38,859
I think not.

192
00:14:39,856 --> 00:14:40,236
Elizabeth.

193
00:14:40,852 --> 00:14:41,232
We gotta go.

194
00:14:41,907 --> 00:14:42,350
Really?

195
00:14:42,856 --> 00:14:43,746
Yes, this was a bad idea.

196
00:14:46,777 --> 00:14:49,094
- Hey, must be ...
- Elizabeth.

197
00:14:50,152 --> 00:14:50,687
Shelby?

198
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,284
Yes, nice to meet you.

199
00:14:53,103 --> 00:14:55,111
Well done, Mickey.

200
00:14:55,515 --> 00:14:56,265
She is very beautiful.

201
00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:00,083
I saw your restaurant
I think it's great.

202
00:15:00,489 --> 00:15:01,973
I wish there was something
so in our school.

203
00:15:02,184 --> 00:15:02,868
Thank you.

204
00:15:03,196 --> 00:15:04,833
Maybe one day,
buy something there.

205
00:15:06,554 --> 00:15:07,795
Hey, let me get a drink.

206
00:15:08,772 --> 00:15:10,640
You know?
We have to go home ...

207
00:15:10,805 --> 00:15:11,867
C'mon, just one drink.

208
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,061
Yes, a drink sounds great.

209
00:15:24,193 --> 00:15:25,486
Okay, what drink?

210
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,714
All we have, I think.

211
00:15:28,126 --> 00:15:29,002
It is a brave girl.

212
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:31,313
- What is Tequila.
- Tequila.

213
00:15:34,023 --> 00:15:36,021
Listen, do not want to seem
strange, therefore,

214
00:15:36,582 --> 00:15:40,200
why not say Mickey
has good taste and leave it?

215
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:41,392
Fair enough.

216
00:15:43,053 --> 00:15:43,501
Great.

217
00:15:44,183 --> 00:15:45,025
Good taste.

218
00:15:45,433 --> 00:15:45,965
Good taste.

219
00:15:52,355 --> 00:15:53,207
You are comparing notes?

220
00:15:54,296 --> 00:15:55,034
And this big.

221
00:15:56,495 --> 00:15:57,738
What is penis size.

222
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:06,888
Stay out of trouble.

223
00:16:13,255 --> 00:16:13,807
Agreed.

224
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:15,991
Are you kidding?

225
00:16:16,762 --> 00:16:17,444
I can not do that.

226
00:16:18,585 --> 00:16:20,118
I have to know the
Mike's parents later.

227
00:16:20,918 --> 00:16:22,164
Really?
No problem.

228
00:16:25,105 --> 00:16:25,635
What?

229
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:28,566
No, no, they are wonderful,
trust me.

230
00:16:30,369 --> 00:16:31,584
Do not do that, what?

231
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:36,824
Not that I am the best
to judge, it's just that ...

232
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,086
They have a strange thing as
that first impression.

233
00:16:41,714 --> 00:16:44,299
So do not let them see what is
completely drunk and be fine.

234
00:16:45,398 --> 00:16:46,054
It's a promise.

235
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,870
So do not be paranoid
not mean that.

236
00:16:52,021 --> 00:16:52,623
It's just ...

237
00:16:52,938 --> 00:16:55,225
... I was Mike's girlfriend
for three years and look at me.

238
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:57,219
I'm not an angel.

239
00:16:57,923 --> 00:16:59,723
Yes, but he was 12.

240
00:17:02,539 --> 00:17:03,176
Sorry.

241
00:17:03,968 --> 00:17:04,572
I have offended you?

242
00:17:09,145 --> 00:17:11,667
If you had seen your face.

243
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:13,086
Hello, okay?

244
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:13,990
Yes.

245
00:17:14,547 --> 00:17:15,151
I like that garora.

246
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,802
I like you, too.

247
00:17:18,231 --> 00:17:20,214
Now get outta here, we are
trying to talk to you.

248
00:17:20,704 --> 00:17:21,558
Okay,
okay.

249
00:17:24,008 --> 00:17:24,552
Agreed.

250
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:25,746
Here we go.

251
00:17:33,422 --> 00:17:33,951
Bye, guys.

252
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:38,530
Good night.

253
00:17:40,381 --> 00:17:41,261
Goodbye, Shel.

254
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,216
Thank you for being ...

255
00:17:48,478 --> 00:17:49,210
Sympathetic?

256
00:17:50,456 --> 00:17:51,461
See? I'm not so bad.

257
00:17:52,087 --> 00:17:54,154
It is the reason why you
like me, right?

258
00:17:56,405 --> 00:17:57,216
Goodnight, Shelby.

259
00:17:59,465 --> 00:18:00,464
... No matter how magnificent it is.

260
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,382
You're going to walk, right?

261
00:18:05,229 --> 00:18:05,750
Let's do it.

262
00:18:06,661 --> 00:18:07,127
Are you okay?

263
00:18:07,761 --> 00:18:09,089
What? Forgot something?

264
00:18:09,725 --> 00:18:12,167
I can not go see his mother,
I'm totally drunk.

265
00:18:12,654 --> 00:18:14,402
All I want is to create
a good impression, you know?

266
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:17,374
It's late and I was drinking e. ..

267
00:18:18,276 --> 00:18:19,218
... I do not think well.

268
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:21,057
You're brilliant.

269
00:18:21,544 --> 00:18:22,590
Billy, tell him how she's okay.

270
00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:24,969
I've never seen so well.

271
00:18:25,251 --> 00:18:26,811
I never saw, Billy.

272
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,038
There is a hotel or some
something like that to stay?

273
00:18:32,574 --> 00:18:33,943
Can not we go tomorrow?

274
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:38,913
- This is stupid ...
- No, no, no. Not for me.

275
00:18:39,665 --> 00:18:41,875
I thought that I would support it, ok?

276
00:18:42,952 --> 00:18:47,333
I'll feel better tomorrow,
if you're sober.

277
00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:52,952
- Okay, I'm with you.
- No, can not.

278
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,490
She is waiting, should
be excited to see him.

279
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,879
Personally, I have training
to handle situations like this.

280
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:04,994
Can I take her to the motel and you to
home safely. OK? No problem.

281
00:19:05,689 --> 00:19:06,355
This is perfect.

282
00:19:07,284 --> 00:19:08,065
Yes, I agree.

283
00:19:09,442 --> 00:19:10,066
I'll get the bags.

284
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:17,312
Okay?

285
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:17,896
Hello

286
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:19,867
We have rooms.

287
00:20:20,737 --> 00:20:21,398
Tonight we are full.

288
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,396
- No, but the sign says ...
- The signal is broken.

289
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:27,496
Anyway it gets crowded
once a year.

290
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:30,029
Come back home at night?

291
00:20:30,151 --> 00:20:31,597
Then go.

292
00:20:31,953 --> 00:20:32,878
Okay.

293
00:20:37,241 --> 00:20:38,862
Where is the nearest motel?

294
00:20:39,887 --> 00:20:41,385
It's all over the neighborhood.

295
00:20:42,249 --> 00:20:43,536
How?
How far is it?

296
00:20:43,984 --> 00:20:45,441
4 miles to the west.

297
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:46,435
4 miles?

298
00:20:58,108 --> 00:20:58,943
You must be kidding.

299
00:21:01,379 --> 00:21:02,985
NO SERVICE

300
00:21:22,152 --> 00:21:22,768
What? 

301
00:21:26,524 --> 00:21:27,578
VACANCIES

302
00:21:27,742 --> 00:21:31,096
NO VACANCIES.

303
00:21:47,586 --> 00:21:48,388
My son?
304th
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:49,845
Hello, Mom.

304
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:51,844
Had to stay awake?

305
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:53,003
Could not sleep.

306
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:56,125
Moreover, his father is
snoring again.

307
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:02,692
- Hey, I thought it would ...
- I would ... I want it ...

308
00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:05,024
... next morning she had to
stay the night in a motel.

309
00:22:05,508 --> 00:22:06,506
Because she is drunk?

310
00:22:08,873 --> 00:22:13,376
Called and said that they had
seen in the Alley with a drunk girl.

311
00:22:13,577 --> 00:22:14,884
She exceeded slightly.

312
00:22:15,774 --> 00:22:17,336
She did not want to cause
bad impression, Mom

313
00:22:17,633 --> 00:22:18,318
Oh, that's nonsense.

314
00:22:18,631 --> 00:22:19,536
That's what I said.

315
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:21,055
You know how women are.

316
00:22:21,737 --> 00:22:22,947
Oh, never mind.

317
00:22:23,246 --> 00:22:24,602
I'm very satisfied
to have you at home.

318
00:22:50,437 --> 00:22:51,102
Hey.

319
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,274
Shit.

320
00:23:13,103 --> 00:23:15,081
Hey, Hey.

321
00:23:22,395 --> 00:23:22,993
Oh, my God.

322
00:23:24,109 --> 00:23:24,661
Oh, my God.

323
00:23:44,425 --> 00:23:45,060
Jesus.

324
00:23:46,973 --> 00:23:47,599
Elizabeth.

325
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:34,018
Missed call Mike

326
00:25:38,355 --> 00:25:38,927
Hey, I am.

327
00:25:39,143 --> 00:25:40,513
Call me when you wake up,
Bucar you go.

328
00:25:41,045 --> 00:25:41,548
Goodbye.

329
00:27:36,913 --> 00:27:38,610
- Hello
- Hello, Mom.

330
00:27:39,685 --> 00:27:41,439
Hey, what are you doing here?

331
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:43,813
Let's go fishing, remember?

332
00:27:45,427 --> 00:27:46,167
Are you serious?

333
00:27:46,627 --> 00:27:47,625
There's something
better to do?

334
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:49,656
This is my number one son.

335
00:27:50,237 --> 00:27:50,845
Hello, Dad.

336
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:53,190
- How do you dormu?
- Well

337
00:27:53,628 --> 00:27:56,658
So, Mike, it seems that cats
Wild are not going so well this year.

338
00:27:56,802 --> 00:27:58,811
- Come on, please.
- What? I'm just saying.

339
00:27:59,112 --> 00:28:01,665
Maybe if Mike were in
team would be something else.

340
00:28:02,178 --> 00:28:03,123
I doubt it, father.

341
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:05,464
He is so modest.

342
00:28:07,461 --> 00:28:08,472
When will seek to Elizabeth?

343
00:28:08,844 --> 00:28:10,254
I do not know
not answer the phone.

344
00:28:10,807 --> 00:28:11,598
Because she is still sleeping.

345
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:14,219
Come on, come to fish,
when we get it back.

346
00:28:16,013 --> 00:28:16,693
Okay.

347
00:28:21,576 --> 00:28:22,624
Be careful where you step.

348
00:29:05,717 --> 00:29:06,663
Awake.

349
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:09,352
What happened?

350
00:29:13,521 --> 00:29:14,268
Remember?

351
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:19,486
Well, I hoped
could tell me.

352
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,737
What I can say is that you were
victim of being hit with stray?

353
00:29:24,403 --> 00:29:27,063
What was on the road alone?

354
00:29:27,788 --> 00:29:28,460
Where was Mike?

355
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,462
I do not know.

356
00:29:33,515 --> 00:29:35,264
My God, sometimes, is an idiot.

357
00:29:37,917 --> 00:29:39,839
He left me at once
road, as well.

358
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:42,988
But at least had the decency
back 10 minutes later.

359
00:29:47,853 --> 00:29:49,542
I still have stuff from when
my mother was sick,

360
00:29:49,861 --> 00:29:50,988
well, I care for you.

361
00:29:53,465 --> 00:29:56,008
God knows what would have happened
if I had not appeared.

362
00:29:59,033 --> 00:30:02,375
- I want to leave now.
- I bet you want, dear.

363
00:30:03,944 --> 00:30:07,195
Unfortunately for both,
can not let you go.

364
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,788
I mean, do not want to be
responsible if it let you go ...

365
00:30:12,448 --> 00:30:13,923
... Others may collect ..

366
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:16,710
... Others have internal bleeding ..

367
00:30:17,546 --> 00:30:18,710
... A blood clot
or something like that.

368
00:30:24,238 --> 00:30:26,126
I have to sedate you
not to scream.

369
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:27,811
I have to call Mike.

370
00:30:28,487 --> 00:30:30,844
Do not worry, I called and
I left a message.

371
00:30:32,113 --> 00:30:34,827
I'm sure it arrives
before I finish watching this.

372
00:30:36,158 --> 00:30:37,925
That is, if he finds,
their voice messages.

373
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:40,421
I mean, you know what is
horrible with the phone.

374
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:42,927
It is one of the reasons they
come first.

375
00:30:45,501 --> 00:30:47,504
Do not get me wrong,
I love Mike.

376
00:30:48,777 --> 00:30:50,411
Has to mature
sooner or later.

377
00:30:58,629 --> 00:30:59,243
What are you doing?

378
00:31:00,287 --> 00:31:01,645
It is one thing that will
help her sleep.

379
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:04,667
Not sure if I want to sleep.

380
00:31:06,178 --> 00:31:07,137
Hey, trust me.

381
00:31:44,209 --> 00:31:45,456
You can relax with this thing?

382
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:48,317
It may continue to feel bad,
let her catch her breath.

383
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,245
What should I do,

384
00:31:50,393 --> 00:31:52,072
I let the weekend
all in a fucking motel?

385
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,861
Not the full weekend,
is a couple of hours.

386
00:31:56,577 --> 00:31:57,391
Afraid of losing it?

387
00:32:01,027 --> 00:32:01,748
They are so, so seriously?

388
00:32:04,003 --> 00:32:05,094
Yes, I think so.

389
00:32:06,271 --> 00:32:08,218
As I was with Shelby or what?

390
00:32:11,465 --> 00:32:13,285
I mean, I have no complaint.

391
00:32:14,655 --> 00:32:16,519
But it's not a sexual thing,
is like ...

392
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,897
... It is an intimate adult relationship.

393
00:32:21,986 --> 00:32:22,657
Whatever.

394
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:24,285
Maybe.

395
00:32:25,406 --> 00:32:26,506
No, the Shelby was different.

396
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,447
It was like a job.

397
00:32:29,307 --> 00:32:31,543
Do what he did,
for it was never enough.

398
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:33,977
Elizabeth is like ...

399
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,414
... I am enough, you know?

400
00:32:38,591 --> 00:32:40,164
No, yes ...
I know.

401
00:32:43,374 --> 00:32:43,818
What?

402
00:32:44,397 --> 00:32:45,709
No, thought I found a rope.

403
00:32:45,744 --> 00:32:46,294
Fuck you.

404
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:40,639
Mike.
Hey, where is beautiful?

405
00:34:27,401 --> 00:34:28,282
Shelby.

406
00:34:52,308 --> 00:34:53,814
Could you tell me what room
Mitchum is Elizabeth?

407
00:34:54,338 --> 00:34:55,613
- When you registered?
- Last night.

408
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:00,634
No, sorry.

409
00:35:01,888 --> 00:35:02,916
Are you sure that this is
her name?

410
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:04,895
Yes, I am sure.

411
00:35:06,831 --> 00:35:08,033
I have no one by that name.

412
00:35:09,061 --> 00:35:10,171
Maybe why not there?

413
00:35:10,386 --> 00:35:12,519
Maybe she has done,
but not at this motel.

414
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,740
Because here was not recorded.

415
00:35:38,131 --> 00:35:39,211
Excuse me, excuse me.

416
00:35:52,797 --> 00:35:53,893
Was stationed here.

417
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:03,971
This does not smell right, man.

418
00:36:04,841 --> 00:36:05,322
What?

419
00:36:05,876 --> 00:36:07,052
This whole situation.

420
00:36:09,098 --> 00:36:13,124
I mean, what do you think?
Perhaps he was cold, though.
422nd
00:36:13,396 --> 00:36:13,872
What?

421
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:14,750
No way.

422
00:36:15,717 --> 00:36:16,576
No, I know Elizabeth.

423
00:36:16,959 --> 00:36:17,463
She would not.

424
00:36:20,465 --> 00:36:22,250
Even if it did,
at least have called.

425
00:36:23,395 --> 00:36:23,987
Something happened.

426
00:36:24,927 --> 00:36:25,699
He called his friends?

427
00:36:25,958 --> 00:36:27,014
I called everyone I know.

428
00:36:27,669 --> 00:36:28,140
Nothing.

429
00:36:29,747 --> 00:36:30,301
Is there anything
we can do?

430
00:36:30,473 --> 00:36:32,278
Follow the car satellite
or something?

431
00:36:32,582 --> 00:36:35,654
I can not communicate missing
at least 48 hours.

432
00:36:37,924 --> 00:36:38,670
Until then may be dead.

433
00:36:42,134 --> 00:36:44,289
So Mike, shit like this
does not happen in this city.

434
00:36:55,016 --> 00:36:55,960
Oh, my God.

435
00:39:46,366 --> 00:39:47,197
Elizabeth?

436
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,199
You awake?

437
00:39:52,071 --> 00:39:52,798
Elizabeth?

438
00:40:03,945 --> 00:40:06,013
You know? If you are going to mess us
affairs of other people ...

439
00:40:06,911 --> 00:40:08,800
... You should ask permission first.

440
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,585
He knows that should not
Pressing the ankle.

441
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:18,372
Let's see what you did.

442
00:40:23,023 --> 00:40:25,153
Sorry Shelby,
not go to your room.

443
00:40:26,005 --> 00:40:26,533
Does it hurts?

444
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:29,014
- Yes, yes, yes.
- And this?

445
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,672
Shelby, please stop.

446
00:40:30,856 --> 00:40:31,547
Stop, stop.

447
00:40:31,979 --> 00:40:32,429
And this?

448
00:40:36,897 --> 00:40:39,453
I spent much time caring
you last night, you know?

449
00:40:42,343 --> 00:40:43,270
The least we could do,

450
00:40:44,384 --> 00:40:46,283
is to collaborate a little.

451
00:40:47,688 --> 00:40:50,255
Instead, it was giving a
walk and fuck it all.

452
00:40:55,933 --> 00:40:57,599
It seems that I have
put it right again.

453
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,904
No, no, no,
please.

454
00:40:59,079 --> 00:40:59,846
Why are you asking me this?

455
00:41:00,242 --> 00:41:01,247
I'm trying to help her.

456
00:42:26,441 --> 00:42:29,345
Look at this guy, William,
entered and started quickly.

457
00:42:40,621 --> 00:42:41,168
Hello

458
00:42:41,867 --> 00:42:42,325
Hello Mike.

459
00:42:43,075 --> 00:42:43,497
Hello

460
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:45,081
How has this number?

461
00:42:45,445 --> 00:42:46,900
Elizabeth gave me last night.

462
00:42:48,002 --> 00:42:49,194
She's great.

463
00:42:50,573 --> 00:42:51,601
Does your mother like her?

464
00:42:51,988 --> 00:42:53,435
Yes, get along well.

465
00:42:54,763 --> 00:42:55,483
Great.

466
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:57,102
I said I would.

467
00:42:58,324 --> 00:42:59,328
Well, whatever.

468
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:03,121
I wonder if
we could see.

469
00:43:04,545 --> 00:43:06,242
Spend some time together
or whatever.

470
00:43:08,408 --> 00:43:09,329
Listen, I do not interpret bad.

471
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:11,236
Just go through the Alley.

472
00:43:12,366 --> 00:43:13,911
I'm sure Elizabeth
understand.

473
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,686
- And dinner?
- No, I can not, my parents planned ...

474
00:43:18,573 --> 00:43:19,442
And lunch?

475
00:43:19,925 --> 00:43:20,537
Lunch?

476
00:43:21,943 --> 00:43:23,429
Okay,
lunch.

477
00:43:24,463 --> 00:43:24,963
Great.

478
00:43:25,722 --> 00:43:26,233
See you there.

479
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:27,482
Bye, Shelby.

480
00:43:40,275 --> 00:43:41,275
Finally woke up, right?

481
00:43:42,028 --> 00:43:42,751
There was a Shelby.

482
00:43:43,827 --> 00:43:44,622
Is everything okay?

483
00:43:45,161 --> 00:43:45,654
Yes.

484
00:43:48,003 --> 00:43:48,547
Problems with the girls?

485
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:50,607
Almost always.

486
00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:54,481
Where to go?

487
00:44:10,422 --> 00:44:11,481
Problems with the girls.

488
00:44:46,304 --> 00:44:47,545
It is still your favorite, right?

489
00:44:53,072 --> 00:44:53,701
Here you go.

490
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:55,117
Thank you.

491
00:44:57,329 --> 00:44:58,665
You know? You have not changed much.

492
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:05,070
When your team plays on television,
I always try to find him.

493
00:45:07,719 --> 00:45:08,784
It's silly, is not it?

494
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,027
I swear I saw him once.

495
00:45:12,993 --> 00:45:13,655
Probably
not to you.

496
00:45:17,862 --> 00:45:19,220
What was Mickey?
It seems she saw the devil.

497
00:45:23,198 --> 00:45:24,557
Look, why can not play ...

498
00:45:24,757 --> 00:45:25,769
This is not Rugby.

499
00:45:27,662 --> 00:45:28,638
Oh, then?

500
00:45:31,162 --> 00:45:31,645
Elizabeth?

501
00:45:33,126 --> 00:45:33,801
Why say that?

502
00:45:35,183 --> 00:45:37,268
I dunno, it's just that ...
has this guy.

503
00:45:40,315 --> 00:45:41,640
She said something
the other night, Shelby?

504
00:45:43,929 --> 00:45:45,716
You know Mike, I feel strange.

505
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:47,424
She drank a lot.

506
00:45:47,747 --> 00:45:48,917
So do not give much attention.

507
00:45:49,071 --> 00:45:49,922
- What?
- It just ...

508
00:45:50,815 --> 00:45:52,960
Not ... I know, she said she had
something going on in her mind.

509
00:45:54,887 --> 00:45:55,896
But she loves you, Mike.

510
00:45:56,636 --> 00:45:57,486
Anyone can see.

511
00:45:58,906 --> 00:45:59,506
The probe to mind?

512
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:04,764
Yes, she said something
about an ex-boyfriend.

513
00:46:05,428 --> 00:46:05,962
Who, Eddie?

514
00:46:06,988 --> 00:46:08,229
You know? I do not remember the name.

515
00:46:09,715 --> 00:46:10,701
Oh, my God.

516
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:11,834
Listen.

517
00:46:12,441 --> 00:46:13,984
Everyone has an ex in her past.

518
00:46:15,527 --> 00:46:16,987
I mean, sometimes,
think of me, huh?

519
00:46:20,341 --> 00:46:21,291
I do not know, it's just that ...

520
00:46:22,121 --> 00:46:25,527
Yesterday I took her to the motel because she
did not want to meet my mom drunk

521
00:46:26,609 --> 00:46:27,595
and now nothing makes sense.

522
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:29,094
She did not even
answer the phone.

523
00:46:30,148 --> 00:46:33,822
I thought you said that
they got along very well.

524
00:46:34,014 --> 00:46:34,697
I did not know what to say.

525
00:46:43,218 --> 00:46:44,041
I am sorry.

526
00:46:47,778 --> 00:46:49,379
It may be necessary
some time for her.

527
00:46:51,964 --> 00:46:53,417
I'm sure she'll call
when it is ready to talk.

528
00:46:58,784 --> 00:46:59,344
I must go.

529
00:47:01,544 --> 00:47:02,868
Hey, after going to Pitt?

530
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:04,955
Maybe.

531
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:06,970
Well, maybe we see ourselves there.

532
00:47:14,551 --> 00:47:15,887
You know?
I had lunch with Mike today.

533
00:47:16,915 --> 00:47:18,018
It seems going very well.

534
00:47:20,934 --> 00:47:22,879
Good to see you can get
upon his feet.

535
00:47:29,117 --> 00:47:31,121
Sorry to be so cold here.

536
00:47:31,423 --> 00:47:33,613
Is that the heater is broken.

537
00:47:52,718 --> 00:47:53,562
Dorma well.

538
00:49:18,482 --> 00:49:19,184
The telephone does not work.

539
00:49:20,538 --> 00:49:21,486
Just needed a little water.

540
00:49:24,377 --> 00:49:24,872
Really?

541
00:49:26,243 --> 00:49:27,146
Why do not seem ...

542
00:49:28,142 --> 00:49:29,189
... That, Elizabeth.

543
00:49:30,082 --> 00:49:30,914
Looks like a phone.

544
00:49:31,745 --> 00:49:32,726
It is a phone, right?

545
00:49:35,287 --> 00:49:36,036
Please do not.

546
00:49:36,614 --> 00:49:37,278
Please, what?

547
00:49:38,352 --> 00:49:41,341
"Please, you have saved
on the road, where it was abandoned?

548
00:49:42,221 --> 00:49:43,259
I thought I had done it.

549
00:49:44,467 --> 00:49:47,024
"Please give a
a bed and a roof?

550
00:49:47,891 --> 00:49:49,020
I thought I had done that.

551
00:49:50,262 --> 00:49:52,135
"Please be a
nurse for yourself?

552
00:49:52,385 --> 00:49:54,511
Well, I tried to do this,
but you're so selfish ...

553
00:49:54,952 --> 00:49:58,138
... All we get in return are
suspect, lies and shit.

554
00:49:59,377 --> 00:50:00,611
Shelby, that is a kidnapping.

555
00:50:00,803 --> 00:50:01,532
Kidnapping?

556
00:50:02,884 --> 00:50:04,551
Can not you see I try to help her?

557
00:50:11,086 --> 00:50:11,737
Great.

558
00:50:12,546 --> 00:50:13,727
Look what you made me do.

559
00:50:19,897 --> 00:50:21,408
What you want from me?

560
00:50:26,179 --> 00:50:29,745
I want to begin enjoying
my hospitality.

561
00:50:31,291 --> 00:50:31,861
I appreciate it.

562
00:50:32,819 --> 00:50:34,289
Oh, Shelby,
I appreciate it.

563
00:50:38,315 --> 00:50:40,543
You know?
Mike was right about you.

564
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:43,123
It is a selfish bitch.

565
00:50:47,865 --> 00:50:50,107
I suggest you go up the stairs
and going to bed

566
00:50:50,108 --> 00:50:52,208
before that, really,
I lose patience.

567
00:52:49,597 --> 00:52:51,997
We called the morgue,
to the hospital and guess what,

568
00:52:53,064 --> 00:52:54,518
no body matches
the description of it.

569
00:52:54,819 --> 00:52:56,413
In fact, there is dead.

570
00:52:59,035 --> 00:53:01,216
- Thanks, man.
- I tried.

571
00:53:06,312 --> 00:53:06,990
It's Elizabeth.

572
00:53:08,434 --> 00:53:09,012
Look at this.

573
00:53:09,663 --> 00:53:10,559
Seems to have become easier.

574
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:12,492
Sorry, things
walked too fast.

575
00:53:12,742 --> 00:53:15,513
I went back to school. I need time
to think. Talk soon, Elizabeth.

576
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,473
- She was scared.
- No way.

577
00:53:18,797 --> 00:53:21,822
Look, I know it sucks, but look
bright side, at least know what is right.

578
00:53:22,954 --> 00:53:23,540
I have to call her.

579
00:53:27,249 --> 00:53:28,111
Michael, calm down.

580
00:53:28,433 --> 00:53:29,379
Michael, what are you doing?

581
00:53:31,993 --> 00:53:35,091
Michael, you have to make time for
she loves you, it's a girl. Stop.

582
00:53:42,336 --> 00:53:43,900
Does this ex-boyfriend?

583
00:53:46,829 --> 00:53:47,405
Eddie?

584
00:53:49,442 --> 00:53:51,127
- As you know ...?
- Elizabeth had a call from Eddie.

585
00:53:51,536 --> 00:53:53,061
When we were in the Alley
and talking with Shel ...

586
00:53:53,192 --> 00:53:56,657
- Why did not you say something?
- No thought was strange, until now.

587
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:01,764
Oh, my God.

588
00:54:04,418 --> 00:54:06,079
Know what I think what's the problem?

589
00:54:06,455 --> 00:54:07,942
I guess you have never before been rejected.

590
00:54:09,098 --> 00:54:09,688
Never.

591
00:54:10,105 --> 00:54:11,474
Dude, no offense, but
I can not hear it ...

592
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,624
No, no. Have to listen because
need some perspective.

593
00:54:15,058 --> 00:54:17,517
Mike, you came to receive
his jersey retired.

594
00:54:18,274 --> 00:54:21,342
you're the only good thing
shit happened in this city.

595
00:54:22,986 --> 00:54:27,355
You know how I feel when I see him playing
out any experiments that went ...

596
00:54:27,523 --> 00:54:30,645
... For one who did not even garora
the decency to end up in your face?

597
00:54:31,576 --> 00:54:35,798
She pretended that she went to the motel
to be able to escape you,

598
00:54:37,075 --> 00:54:38,125
Stay with a
girlfriend like this ...

599
00:54:39,382 --> 00:54:40,223
... I pity you.

600
00:54:45,842 --> 00:54:46,617
You know what? That's right.

601
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,212
Fuck it, let's have fun.

602
00:54:50,609 --> 00:54:51,270
So it is spoken.

603
00:54:52,397 --> 00:54:53,520
Come on Rita.

604
00:54:54,089 --> 00:54:55,218
Let's see some fours.

605
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,322
I'm not going to any
strip club.

606
00:54:56,479 --> 00:54:57,181
Just kidding.

607
00:54:57,686 --> 00:54:58,583
Rita retired.

608
00:54:59,408 --> 00:55:00,118
Unfortunately.

609
00:55:00,971 --> 00:55:03,204
- What do you think of Pitt?
- Do not go to Pitt, Shelby will be there.

610
00:55:03,952 --> 00:55:04,910
Okay, so we go to pitt.

611
00:55:13,032 --> 00:55:13,566
So ...

612
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:15,920
How am I?

613
00:55:21,796 --> 00:55:22,717
Do you think Michael will like it?

614
00:55:24,096 --> 00:55:25,135
You know? I'll see you later.

615
00:55:26,797 --> 00:55:29,205
There appears to be very bad
since it is not on your side.

616
00:55:30,889 --> 00:55:32,125
It is not surprising.

617
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:34,100
are you?

618
00:55:41,215 --> 00:55:41,910
You know?

619
00:55:42,949 --> 00:55:44,147
I think Michael will like.

620
00:55:46,115 --> 00:55:46,890
Wish me luck.

621
00:55:54,692 --> 00:55:57,819
- Health
- Exactly.

622
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:10,440
Yes, that's it.

623
00:56:15,523 --> 00:56:16,053
Hello, everyone.

624
00:56:19,893 --> 00:56:22,232
- How are you?
- You are very sexy.

625
00:56:22,707 --> 00:56:23,220
Thank you.

626
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,484
Shel, Shel.
Wait.

627
00:58:36,226 --> 00:58:36,585
What?

628
00:58:37,865 --> 00:58:38,512
This is not a good idea.

629
00:58:39,482 --> 00:58:41,093
Yes, go for a more peaceful place.

630
00:58:41,407 --> 00:58:42,056
No, not that.

631
00:58:42,783 --> 00:58:43,291
What is it?

632
00:58:44,815 --> 00:58:45,665
I can not do this.

633
00:58:46,696 --> 00:58:48,505
I'm drunk and I'm not
thinking logically.

634
00:58:48,678 --> 00:58:49,252
No.

635
00:58:49,556 --> 00:58:50,410
This is a good thing.

636
00:58:50,798 --> 00:58:52,972
Finally, not listening
all that shit they say.

637
00:59:01,617 --> 00:59:02,186
Gotta go.

638
00:59:03,305 --> 00:59:04,343
Hey.

639
00:59:06,133 --> 00:59:07,501
She does not love you, Mike.

640
00:59:24,121 --> 00:59:25,197
Come on.

641
00:59:57,831 --> 00:59:58,565
Whether breakfast, Mike?

642
01:00:02,269 --> 01:00:04,032
No new posts.

643
01:00:17,306 --> 01:00:18,126
Good morning.

644
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:22,101
My God, my mother recalls.

645
01:00:23,108 --> 01:00:24,592
All fragile and weak.

646
01:00:25,544 --> 01:00:26,975
Setia me sick, only to see it.

647
01:00:29,579 --> 01:00:30,771
Have you ever lost someone like that?

648
01:00:32,924 --> 01:00:33,370
No.

649
01:00:34,637 --> 01:00:36,224
Because it's not like disappear,
know?

650
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:39,506
Then when they go,

651
01:00:41,023 --> 01:00:42,717
all the time that we take care of them,

652
01:00:43,653 --> 01:00:45,652
realize that it was like.

653
01:00:47,426 --> 01:00:49,849
It only hurts losing a child.

654
01:00:51,546 --> 01:00:52,150
That's baloney.

655
01:00:56,596 --> 01:00:57,922
Should eat.

656
01:00:59,556 --> 01:01:00,933
The more you eat, the more
will be well soon.

657
01:01:01,698 --> 01:01:03,909
The faster you eat,
the faster you can go ...

658
01:01:07,297 --> 01:01:07,999
... Without Mike.

659
01:01:13,346 --> 01:01:14,437
Think they'll like?

660
01:01:17,755 --> 01:01:18,743
I do not know
but I like it.

661
01:01:18,894 --> 01:01:21,512
I went to many places to
find the right size, but ...

662
01:01:23,245 --> 01:01:24,245
... He does not care.

663
01:01:30,092 --> 01:01:32,029
Last night I almost
I hurt her boyfriend.

664
01:01:32,848 --> 01:01:34,587
And I think this may be the night.

665
01:01:36,983 --> 01:01:37,756
Think?

666
01:01:52,404 --> 01:01:53,392
- Lloyd.
- Hello There, Shelby.

667
01:01:54,411 --> 01:01:56,378
Tried to call, but I think what happened
something with your phone.

668
01:01:58,723 --> 01:01:59,274
Are you okay?

669
01:01:59,844 --> 01:02:01,499
Ah, yes, I was just,
arranging the heater.

670
01:02:02,674 --> 01:02:03,247
I come in?

671
01:02:04,067 --> 01:02:04,994
Oh, sure.

672
01:02:05,807 --> 01:02:06,271
Of course.

673
01:02:25,226 --> 01:02:27,317
Warnings account canceled ...
Account in debt ...

674
01:02:27,499 --> 01:02:28,638
I regret that the house is
a mess.

675
01:02:29,742 --> 01:02:31,368
I had no time for anything lately.

676
01:02:39,758 --> 01:02:41,272
I thought I had spoken to
going to the bank.

677
01:02:42,365 --> 01:02:43,463
Yes, said next week.

678
01:02:44,794 --> 01:02:45,609
You said yesterday.

679
01:02:46,737 --> 01:02:48,931
And really, should have passed
there two months ago.

680
01:02:56,649 --> 01:02:58,868
But I have tried
change a thing.

681
01:02:59,999 --> 01:03:01,678
One thing that really
Mike and I had thought,

682
01:03:01,679 --> 01:03:03,379
the need for extra space.

683
01:03:09,846 --> 01:03:13,248
It's that damn heater
make noise all day.

684
01:03:29,482 --> 01:03:32,210
Are you sure that there is no way
you can get more money from the bank?

685
01:03:36,581 --> 01:03:37,255
Shelby.

686
01:03:40,321 --> 01:03:41,500
Guess you do not understand.

687
01:03:42,145 --> 01:03:43,720
There is profit taking in the Alley.

688
01:03:44,538 --> 01:03:45,707
Not pay their debts.

689
01:03:46,066 --> 01:03:47,501
And is using this
home as collateral.

690
01:03:48,072 --> 01:03:48,899
What are you saying?

691
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:52,831
I'm saying is losing
this house and the Alley.

692
01:03:53,435 --> 01:03:54,588
Can not be with this house.

693
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:57,761
It was the home of my mother.

694
01:03:58,510 --> 01:04:00,156
- Shelby, sorry.
- What will become of me and Mike?

695
01:04:00,994 --> 01:04:02,004
It is the decision of the bank.

696
01:04:02,882 --> 01:04:04,370
You can stay until the end of January.

697
01:04:05,302 --> 01:04:07,290
- After that.
- I want you to go away now.

698
01:04:29,974 --> 01:04:30,498
Hey.

699
01:04:31,648 --> 01:04:32,253
Help.

700
01:04:38,534 --> 01:04:39,182
Help me.

701
01:04:44,828 --> 01:04:45,612
Help me.

702
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:49,283
Help.

703
01:05:20,002 --> 01:05:20,914
This is all your fault.

704
01:05:22,302 --> 01:05:25,864
Just because Lloyd saw her on the bench with Mike
is that he knew he was lying.

705
01:05:28,676 --> 01:05:30,009
I understand what you are trying to do.

706
01:05:31,866 --> 01:05:33,176
Want to come back with him.

707
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:36,153
You can not control everything?

708
01:05:37,488 --> 01:05:40,444
The truth is we can not
control everything, Shelby.

709
01:05:41,391 --> 01:05:44,029
What s happening to you
is the result of what he does.

710
01:05:44,856 --> 01:05:46,625
Nobody understands what I went through.

711
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:50,486
All I have to do is wait
to come see this place

712
01:05:50,487 --> 01:05:52,687
to know how much you're fucked.

713
01:05:53,819 --> 01:05:54,421
I can not.

714
01:05:57,728 --> 01:05:59,901
Do not make me psychoanalysis.

715
01:06:01,057 --> 01:06:01,642
They are liars.

716
01:06:03,419 --> 01:06:03,968
Understand.

717
01:06:04,366 --> 01:06:04,872
These are lies.

718
01:06:07,952 --> 01:06:09,883
Shelby, do not do this, no.

719
01:06:10,831 --> 01:06:11,688
you are pathetic.

720
01:06:43,361 --> 01:06:44,564
Mike, Shelby,
tries to kill me, Elizabeth.

721
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:46,768
Nice try, thanks
again by the coat.

722
01:06:47,376 --> 01:06:48,143
Mike will like.

723
01:06:56,301 --> 01:06:57,575
What are you doing?

724
01:06:58,290 --> 01:06:59,374
Please
please.

725
01:07:25,491 --> 01:07:27,298
How did it?
This is not even possible.

726
01:07:28,603 --> 01:07:29,631
Someone is making cheating.

727
01:07:30,567 --> 01:07:31,179
See you then.

728
01:07:31,565 --> 01:07:32,106
Thank you.

729
01:07:32,727 --> 01:07:33,429
Thank you.

730
01:07:33,561 --> 01:07:35,221
Mike, darling.
You have a visitor.

731
01:07:36,338 --> 01:07:36,869
Hello, everyone.

732
01:07:37,650 --> 01:07:38,646
- Hello, Shelby.
- Hello There, Shelby.

733
01:07:38,812 --> 01:07:40,071
- Hello, Mr. Donaldson.
- Hello, Shelby.

734
01:07:43,593 --> 01:07:44,394
I can speak a second?

735
01:07:46,026 --> 01:07:47,319
Yes, after this game.

736
01:07:49,072 --> 01:07:49,807
Great.

737
01:07:52,229 --> 01:07:52,700
Ok

738
01:07:52,907 --> 01:07:53,517
What do you have?

739
01:08:32,878 --> 01:08:33,567
Oh, my God.

740
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:42,844
POISONOUS PLANTS

741
01:08:49,783 --> 01:08:51,298
Death certificate

742
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:57,896
There will be an autopsy at the request
his daughter, Shelby Mercer.

743
01:09:24,001 --> 01:09:25,074
So, Shelby, wanted to talk?

744
01:09:25,963 --> 01:09:26,987
Wait a minute.

745
01:09:27,589 --> 01:09:28,068
Okay?

746
01:09:28,233 --> 01:09:28,899
It's a surprise.

747
01:09:42,874 --> 01:09:43,684
It is for you.

748
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:46,053
Open.

749
01:10:02,173 --> 01:10:02,799
Thanks, Shelby.

750
01:10:04,037 --> 01:10:04,506
Where ...?

751
01:10:05,655 --> 01:10:06,640
Thought you might like.

752
01:10:07,843 --> 01:10:10,248
Yes, this is ... is great.

753
01:10:10,651 --> 01:10:11,154
Truth.

754
01:10:12,036 --> 01:10:12,541
Thank you.

755
01:10:15,865 --> 01:10:17,241
Wear it,
do not be shy.

756
01:10:18,221 --> 01:10:19,532
Come on, try it.

757
01:10:28,315 --> 01:10:28,954
Look ...

758
01:10:29,928 --> 01:10:30,598
Impressive.

759
01:10:33,014 --> 01:10:34,339
- I'm so proud of you.
- Shelby, please.

760
01:10:35,265 --> 01:10:35,770
What?

761
01:10:37,904 --> 01:10:38,394
What is it?

762
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:42,999
- Why is it so?
- Listen, we're finished.

763
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:43,974
Finished.

764
01:10:44,514 --> 01:10:46,455
I thought we could be friends,
but obviously you can not.

765
01:10:46,617 --> 01:10:48,215
- But last night ...
- He was drunk, Shelby.

766
01:10:48,502 --> 01:10:49,788
- Do not say that.
- It's true.

767
01:10:50,395 --> 01:10:53,983
I was drunk, confused and upset
with Elizabeth, but that is what we like.

768
01:10:54,884 --> 01:10:56,755
Do not care that feels
the same for me or not.

769
01:11:01,565 --> 01:11:04,682
If that selfish bitch had died
a month ago I would have stayed with you.

770
01:11:05,879 --> 01:11:07,926
I could have you in the
school and everything would have been fine.

771
01:11:09,627 --> 01:11:11,026
But that's not what happened.

772
01:11:12,149 --> 01:11:13,187
She was his mother, Shelby American.

773
01:11:14,243 --> 01:11:15,993
I can not believe what he said,
what is wrong with you?

774
01:11:16,885 --> 01:11:17,674
Please, Mickey.

775
01:11:19,975 --> 01:11:20,830
You're all I have.

776
01:11:23,717 --> 01:11:25,404
Please
I do not put in this position.

777
01:11:35,453 --> 01:11:36,183
Shelby.

778
01:11:37,738 --> 01:11:38,872
Come on, everything will be fine.

779
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:42,504
Give me just a little time.

780
01:11:48,605 --> 01:11:49,502
It's your fault, genius.

781
01:11:49,796 --> 01:11:50,933
Which part is my fault?

782
01:11:51,298 --> 01:11:52,891
You addressed the situation worse.

783
01:11:54,770 --> 01:11:55,491
How?

784
01:11:56,110 --> 01:11:58,186
I do not know, maybe if you like
was a bitch last night?

785
01:11:58,839 --> 01:12:00,369
What has to do this?
What do you mean?

786
01:12:00,568 --> 01:12:03,638
What do I mean? I'm tired of
listen to you complain all the time.

787
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:08,503
Garora has a wonderful, beautiful
smart and all they do is reject it.

788
01:12:09,306 --> 01:12:10,650
Yes, if you think that is so good
why not her?

789
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:13,519
Yes it's a good question.
Yes, it loves you, idiot.

790
01:12:15,298 --> 01:12:16,952
Shelby does anything for you.

791
01:12:17,986 --> 01:12:20,161
You left the city and
she still loves you.

792
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:21,856
Was rejected 10 times and
still loves you.

793
01:12:24,997 --> 01:12:26,468
As all of this city.

794
01:12:26,798 --> 01:12:28,541
Do not start with that shit.

795
01:12:28,668 --> 01:12:30,996
Sorry, that is,
was too much for you.

796
01:12:35,741 --> 01:12:36,361
See you tomorrow.

797
01:13:07,228 --> 01:13:07,968
Shit.

798
01:15:11,588 --> 01:15:13,074
No, please.

799
01:15:19,722 --> 01:15:20,444
You stupid bitch.

800
01:15:42,128 --> 01:15:43,717
My parents have money.

801
01:15:47,192 --> 01:15:48,173
What did you say?

802
01:15:48,832 --> 01:15:49,716
My parents have money.

803
01:15:50,870 --> 01:15:51,924
EPoSS pay what you want.

804
01:15:53,797 --> 01:15:54,619
Think you want your money?

805
01:15:56,738 --> 01:15:57,904
I know what you think.

806
01:15:58,433 --> 01:15:59,080
You read those papers.

807
01:16:03,965 --> 01:16:05,549
- I do not understand.
- I understand.

808
01:16:06,814 --> 01:16:08,277
You had to deal with a lot.

809
01:16:08,410 --> 01:16:09,778
It was not his job to care for his mother.

810
01:16:09,903 --> 01:16:10,775
Do not kill.

811
01:16:13,212 --> 01:16:13,903
Listen, Shelby.

812
01:16:14,639 --> 01:16:17,358
There is nothing you have done
that can not be undone.

813
01:16:18,851 --> 01:16:22,304
If you let me go, go away
and do not count anything. Interest.

814
01:16:26,017 --> 01:16:27,502
People do not always
do what they say.

815
01:16:29,191 --> 01:16:30,628
There was never anything enough,
Good for her.

816
01:16:32,439 --> 01:16:33,062
Never.

817
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:35,595
Shelby.

818
01:16:37,657 --> 01:16:41,477
All you're thinking
in doing, please do not.

819
01:16:42,167 --> 01:16:43,211
I like to solve everything.

820
01:16:45,907 --> 01:16:47,288
Everything depended on me.

821
01:16:48,108 --> 01:16:49,386
There was nobody to help us.

822
01:16:50,229 --> 01:16:51,343
I had to make a decision.

823
01:16:52,559 --> 01:16:53,626
She was a monster.

824
01:16:55,747 --> 01:16:58,036
Do not be like her,
stop what you started.

825
01:16:59,537 --> 01:17:00,087
What are you doing?

826
01:17:03,284 --> 01:17:03,778
No.

827
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:04,541
No.

828
01:17:05,738 --> 01:17:06,493
No.

829
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:36,458
Hello, everyone.

830
01:17:36,613 --> 01:17:38,110
Mom, go away.

831
01:18:29,722 --> 01:18:30,398
Are you ready?

832
01:18:32,662 --> 01:18:33,225
Here you go.

833
01:18:38,024 --> 01:18:39,727
No, better not think the jacket.

834
01:18:40,309 --> 01:18:42,402
Why? He was so good on you.

835
01:18:44,085 --> 01:18:45,092
I do not know, Shelby gave me.

836
01:18:45,713 --> 01:18:47,435
Well, you should use it.

837
01:18:48,230 --> 01:18:49,715
Will not want to hurt him
feelings, right?

838
01:19:58,251 --> 01:19:59,306
- Hello
- Hello

839
01:20:00,258 --> 01:20:01,128
What happened to you?

840
01:20:01,963 --> 01:20:04,127
Is that fell down the stairs.

841
01:20:04,836 --> 01:20:05,352
Okay?

842
01:20:05,727 --> 01:20:06,295
I'm fine.

843
01:20:06,772 --> 01:20:07,195
What's happening?

844
01:20:09,228 --> 01:20:11,116
Was in the neighborhood and thought ...

845
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:15,110
... I thought going on here wanted to see if
that left her at the ceremony Mike.

846
01:20:16,361 --> 01:20:16,851
Billy.

847
01:20:17,563 --> 01:20:19,021
Yes, I thought I would
react this way.

848
01:20:20,103 --> 01:20:20,891
But just thought ...

849
01:20:22,245 --> 01:20:22,927
... In check.
852nd
01:20:24,269 --> 01:20:25,387
You know, Billy?

850
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:27,162
Now, is not a good time.

851
01:20:35,606 --> 01:20:37,363
All is well with you, Shelby?

852
01:20:38,327 --> 01:20:39,249
Yes, I'm fine.

853
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,114
It was only a weekend
somewhat difficult.

854
01:20:43,272 --> 01:20:44,717
Sorry how
Mickey has been treating it,

855
01:20:45,063 --> 01:20:46,598
It's an idiot I told him.

856
01:20:47,938 --> 01:20:48,671
Okay.

857
01:20:49,563 --> 01:20:50,638
I'm used to it.

858
01:20:52,413 --> 01:20:54,916
Maybe that will happen some
bring it back.

859
01:20:55,493 --> 01:20:57,001
Yes, maybe it is time ...

860
01:20:58,106 --> 01:20:59,656
... you go ahead
You know what I mean?

861
01:20:59,887 --> 01:21:00,826
Know the number of boys ...

862
01:21:00,970 --> 01:21:03,370
... They wanted a girl like you?

863
01:21:13,951 --> 01:21:15,941
Are the fuses.
I'll check the basement, okay?

864
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:17,054
No, Billy.

865
01:21:17,626 --> 01:21:18,822
Never mind,
we can fix later.

866
01:21:19,451 --> 01:21:21,040
Not after repair,
repair now, so good.

867
01:21:21,194 --> 01:21:22,452
Not a big problem.

868
01:21:23,133 --> 01:21:24,280
We going to the ceremony.

869
01:21:24,595 --> 01:21:25,680
Relax, be right back.

870
01:22:14,203 --> 01:22:15,235
Sorry, Billy.

871
01:22:38,180 --> 01:22:39,733
Now, I'll put it
a new jail.

872
01:23:06,664 --> 01:23:07,381
Coach.

873
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:09,539
Hello, how are you?

874
01:23:10,146 --> 01:23:11,210
Hello Mike.

875
01:23:13,699 --> 01:23:14,944
See you there.
I brought the camera.

876
01:23:17,258 --> 01:23:18,284
Come, come here.

877
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:23,571
Just so you know, I am
completely against it.

878
01:23:24,271 --> 01:23:26,417
I think it is a mistake
withdraw a player like that.

879
01:23:26,909 --> 01:23:29,009
Sends cheating
current players.

880
01:23:29,595 --> 01:23:32,234
Telling them that the best years
their lives are about to end.

881
01:23:32,548 --> 01:23:33,937
Give them permission to lose.

882
01:23:34,572 --> 01:23:36,452
I do not like losing, Donaldson.

883
01:23:37,589 --> 01:23:38,924
Coach,'m sorry.

884
01:23:39,308 --> 01:23:39,861
I had no idea.

885
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,047
Oh, so where is your mood?
Of course I like.

886
01:23:43,415 --> 01:23:44,806
What do you think they teach
of you at school?

887
01:23:46,206 --> 01:23:47,165
Look, I gotta go.

888
01:23:48,534 --> 01:23:49,897
Do not be nervous when they speak
your name, okay?

889
01:23:51,588 --> 01:23:52,305
Really?

890
01:24:54,411 --> 01:24:56,446
I have seen many great
Players go through those doors.

891
01:24:57,283 --> 01:24:59,571
But few show commitment

892
01:25:00,723 --> 01:25:05,199
the skill and elegance
the young man that I will present today.

893
01:25:45,518 --> 01:25:48,310
Let's give a warm welcome by
back to the actual number 7

894
01:25:48,966 --> 01:25:51,070
Kevin Michael Donaldson.

895
01:25:55,736 --> 01:25:57,401
Kevin Michael Donaldson.

896
01:26:01,541 --> 01:26:02,032
Billy, I am.

897
01:26:02,282 --> 01:26:04,500
Call me when it arrives,
I know where is Elizabeth.

898
01:27:21,519 --> 01:27:22,138
Eli

899
01:27:26,364 --> 01:27:26,896
Shelby.

900
01:27:30,325 --> 01:27:30,806
Shelby.

901
01:27:32,455 --> 01:27:33,059
Opens.

902
01:27:33,584 --> 01:27:34,040
Shelby.

903
01:27:35,216 --> 01:27:35,815
Where is she, Shelby?

904
01:27:37,154 --> 01:27:37,616
Elizabeth.

905
01:27:38,490 --> 01:27:38,975
Elizabeth.

906
01:27:42,249 --> 01:27:42,748
Elizabeth.

907
01:27:44,970 --> 01:27:45,916
Where the hell is she, Shelby?

908
01:27:53,439 --> 01:27:53,891
Elizabeth.

909
01:27:55,374 --> 01:27:55,830
Shit.

910
01:27:58,826 --> 01:27:59,772
Excuse me, excuse me.

911
01:28:04,644 --> 01:28:05,925
I would not want it that way.

912
01:28:09,851 --> 01:28:10,438
Shelby.

913
01:28:11,732 --> 01:28:12,308
you're sick.

914
01:28:13,041 --> 01:28:13,555
Need help.

915
01:28:14,077 --> 01:28:14,615
Do not say that.

916
01:28:15,259 --> 01:28:15,867
Do not do anything foolish.

917
01:28:16,820 --> 01:28:18,271
What?
This is what we want?

918
01:28:18,667 --> 01:28:19,346
Do not do anything stupid ...

919
01:28:32,899 --> 01:28:33,548
Come on.

920
01:28:34,911 --> 01:28:35,476
Come on.

921
01:28:55,210 --> 01:28:56,092
Here we go.

922
01:28:56,378 --> 01:28:56,962
Go sit ...

923
01:28:57,502 --> 01:28:58,969
... In order to free her.

924
01:28:59,697 --> 01:29:00,172
Okay.

925
01:29:04,110 --> 01:29:04,605
Look for a knife.

926
01:29:05,462 --> 01:29:05,996
Right.

927
01:29:17,224 --> 01:29:17,811
Mike!

928
01:29:25,427 --> 01:29:26,313
You said it was forever.

929
01:29:35,721 --> 01:29:36,481
Elizabeth, no.

930
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:39,163
Do not.

931
01:30:29,607 --> 01:30:30,457
Come on.

932
01:31:47,774 --> 01:31:48,354
Shelby.

933
01:31:49,175 --> 01:31:50,803
Mother,
go away.

934
