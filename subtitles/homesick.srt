Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

2
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,365
Okay, now it's quiet again.

3
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,084
We have peace at home again.

4
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,684
Go on! Go on!
This way...

5
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,162
Wait, wait, wait.
I can't get the key... ah! Now!

6
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,281
Here?

7
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,051
Hold on, we can't get through.
This way!

8
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,442
Just this way!
- Upended!

9
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,601
Yep, thanks!

10
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,881
All right, that's the kitchen.
the music room is straight ahead...

11
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,966
The living room to the left...

12
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,528
That goes into the kitchen,
doesn't it?

13
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,769
Just put it down somewhere.

14
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,561
Okay.

15
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,446
Careful!

16
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,123
Wow! Cool wall.

17
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,367
Yeah, we got it like that.
I think it's pretty awesome.

18
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,764
But Jessi considers painting it again.
- Why is that?

19
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,010
Other people have to pay
to get something like that done.

20
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,402
The bathroom is back there, right?

21
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,288
Hey, that wall is awesome!

22
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,244
The whole place is awesome.
All these rooms with high ceilings!

23
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,968
Melli, are you jealous?
- Haha.

A film by JAKOB M. ERWA

25
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,966
Can you hand me my glass of wine?
- There you go.

26
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,723
Thank you for all your help!
- Great flat!

27
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,407
Thank you.

28
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,961
Thank you.

29
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,280
What for?

30
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,891
For everything.

31
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,808
Evening!
- Yes, good evening, young man!

32
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,646
I know you might have
other habits than we do.

33
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,480
But we can hear your music
very loud in our bedroom.

34
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,161
Oh, is it too loud? I'm sorry.

35
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,406
It's after midnight.
Maybe you consider calling it quits?

36
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,724
My husband has a light sleep.
You know?

37
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,889
Good evening!
- Good evening!

38
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,729
I'm really sorry. Well, um...
We will be quiet now.

39
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,729
Good night!
- Good night!

40
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,681
What was that?

41
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,325
Hello!
- Hello!

42
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,048
We are your new neighbours
from downstairs.

43
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,168
We want to apologise for
the loud music, once again.

44
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,690
Now that's charming!
That's why you have come here?

45
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,202
I'm Lorenz, hello!
- Hilde Domweber.

46
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,320
Jessica.
- Jessica.

47
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,967
Oh, I have got
something for you as well.

48
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,761
Wait a moment.

49
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,326
A little welcome gift!

50
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,481
Oh, well... Thanks!

51
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,122
Not worth mentioning.
A warm welcome.

52
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,645
Sorry again for yesterday,
that won't happen again.

53
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,327
No hard feelings!
We once were young, too.

54
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,531
In the past, only people of our age
used to live here.

55
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,208
But some couldn't afford the rent
anymore. Others passed away.

56
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,408
The neighbourhood changes.
The house changes. That's how it goes.

57
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,727
Well then! Thanks once again!
If you need anything: ring the bell.

58
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,321
Thanks!
- Thanks!

59
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,251
I'm the inofficial caretaker here,
you know?

60
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,607
Ah! Okay.

61
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,609
Does every new neighbour get this?
Or is it just bad luck?

62
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,726
Come on, let's just put it somewhere
it may accidentally fall down.

63
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,087
Isn't it strange that the neighbours
can look right into our flat?

64
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,366
If they enjoy it.

65
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,124
We've got nothing to hide.

66
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,885
No kidding!

67
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,961
I guess it will be fine once
they found out how boring we are.

68
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,209
If you want we can
put up some curtains tomorrow?

69
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,201
Well, no.

70
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,331
But you promised that the internet
would be ok. So why isn't it working?

71
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,002
That's why I notified
the change of addresses that early...

72
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,601
Yes.

73
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,121
Yes, I'm holding on.

74
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,407
Yes?

75
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,290
So please, connect me.

76
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,247
Oops!

77
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,042
Someone's in a hurry!
- You scared me!

78
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,768
No worries, it's just me.
We will probably meet more often.

79
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,281
Hello?

80
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,048
Here?
- Yes. Ah! That does me good.

81
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,447
Not too hard, be more gentle.

82
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,565
You can massage yourself
if you're delivering a lecture.

83
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,967
I'll keep quiet.

84
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,329
They want to visit our flat.

85
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,367
Who are "they"?

86
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,846
My parents called.

87
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,411
So they should come and visit.
- But not as such!

88
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,849
Everything should look...

89
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,241
It's not presentable like that.
or is it?

90
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,284
Why not?
We're not a museum.

91
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,930
Hey, they know we just moved in.

92
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,567
Tell them we're inviting them over
for a picnic with moving boxes romance.

93
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,801
Hello?

94
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,721
Yes, please?

95
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,087
What? Really?

96
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,409
Yes, okay, thank you!
Thank you. You too!

97
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,610
It's me. I will fly!

98
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,969
Really?
- Yes!

99
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,481
That's awesome!

100
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,044
I'm so happy!
I'm so happy!

101
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,050
Certainly the right choice.

102
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,961
And so bright!

103
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,441
Thanks, Mum.

104
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,767
But...

105
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,242
these walls will be painted.
right?

106
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,644
No, Dad. They'll stay like this.

107
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,001
What?

108
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,201
Like this?

109
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,085
Yes, we like it like this.

110
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,690
Well, I'm only saying...

111
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,725
one is allowed to ask
if the one is paying half of the rent.

112
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,408
Jessi will be flying to Moscow
next month.

113
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,890
She has been chosen
from all German academies...

114
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,766
to represent Germany in the
"Young Classix Award".

115
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,410
It's an international competition
considered for the elite.

116
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,046
Great, darling!

117
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,250
Well, that sounds alright.

118
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,803
Will they pay the flights
or do I have to pay for this?

119
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,885
Dad, that's a serious thing.

120
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,880
Each country elects only one musician.

121
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,211
I've been working for
such an opportunity for years.

122
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,525
That's not a funny game. It's my chance.

123
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,802
And yes: All costs will be covered.

124
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,561
No worries.

125
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,887
Ha! That's where my tax money goes!

126
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,202
Well, to be serious: I'm happy for you.

127
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,446
I'll support you as long
as you're enjoying it.

128
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,801
Cheers!

129
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,606
Do you think, we should
really paint this wall?

130
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,601
Nonsense!

131
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,281
Why?

132
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,964
Hey... hey... Jessi!

133
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,321
What's the matter?

134
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,684
All in all, it has been quite
a nice evening. Huh?

135
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,885
You do know your father.

136
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,930
He doesn't know any better.

137
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,682
Your Mum almost didn't want to leave.

138
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,681
She liked it.

139
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,164
I shouldn't have bothered...

140
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,527
to arrange the whole flat in one day.

141
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,689
He always picks on something!

142
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,641
It took us so long
to find a beautiful place.

143
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,810
Don't let it be ruined.

144
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,364
Is my make-up smudged now?

145
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,360
A little bit.
But you're still cute.

146
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,851
You don't have to prove yourself
all the time.

147
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,761
Yes.

148
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,761
Okay.

149
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,767
Hello!

150
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,361
Is it a him or a her?

151
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,081
And how old are you?

152
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,971
Umm, I don't know.
A few weeks, I guess.

153
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,290
It's a male, his name is Pikachu.

154
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,846
Pardon?
- Pikachu.

155
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,042
Actually, animals are not
allowed here.

156
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,080
But I won't tell anyone!

157
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,082
The management
didn't mention that.

158
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,726
Then it will be fine.

159
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,921
Have a nice day!

160
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,081
Bye!

161
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,244
As long as it stays clean!

162
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,850
Come on, sweetie!

163
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,447
Pikachu!

164
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,326
Well, then stay in there!

165
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,931
He needs time to acclimate.

166
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,888
I'm crawling over the floor for an hour.

167
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,604
He doesn't like me.

168
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,370
He likes everyone who feeds him!

169
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,881
Give him some time!

170
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,123
I gotta go or I'll be late.
Kiss!

171
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,729
Bye, you two!
- Bye!

172
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,607
Hello?

173
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,287
Hello?

174
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,921
Hello?!

175
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,366
Good morning, my dear.
- Hello.

176
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,131
Well, don't look so scared!

177
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,161
In the last part you had the courage
to make it more personal.

178
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,248
It's the subtle nuances,
they make the difference.

179
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,241
Very well done.

180
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,486
They are all technically excellent.
Like you are.

181
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,881
Don't worry.

182
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,203
But dare to be more emotional.
That will make the difference.

183
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,041
You can do it.
I know you can.

184
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,682
You just have to believe in yourself.

185
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,408
Yes, thank you.

186
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,528
I'm trying hard, I can do better.

187
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,047
Okay.

188
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,645
Bye!
- See you!

189
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,884
In front of whose door is that?
- In front of ours.

190
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,089
It was there when I got home.
- Oh Shit!

191
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,121
Poor thing!
- Yes, very funny. I was so amused.

192
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,561
Sorry.

193
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,371
Who does such a thing?

194
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,490
That's what I'd like to know, too.

195
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,162
I went up to our neighbours.
They didn't even open the door.

196
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:48,002
Maybe they weren't at home.
- They were. I could hear them inside.

197
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,366
Maybe they didn't
hear the bell or were busy.

198
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,847
Busy? With new surprises?

199
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,370
Lorenz, honestly: I don't know...

200
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,446
If you want.
I head upstairs to talk to them.

201
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,962
They wouldn't open the door anyway.

202
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,206
Told you so.

203
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,810
Yes? How can I help you?

204
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,321
Evening!

205
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,761
Please excuse the late disturbance...

206
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,843
Well, my girlfriend found a small pile
in front of our door...

207
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,931
Animal faeces...

208
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,566
So we're a bit worried.

209
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,242
Oh my goodness.
How terrible! Poor girl!

210
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,802
But this wouldn't happen here.

211
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,526
It's a clean house.

212
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,484
Yes, of course.

213
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,961
Haven't you seen or heard
anything suspicious?

214
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,289
No, nothing.

215
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,002
Do you know who owns
a dog in this house?

216
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,010
There aren't any
dogs here.

217
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,281
Okay.

218
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,321
Good night!

219
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,125
Sorry again to disturb you.

220
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,528
Compliments to your girlfriend!

221
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,446
I Will.

222
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,969
She shouldn't worry!

223
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,440
Hello!
- Hello!

224
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,161
Thank you!

225
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,885
I have a stupid question:

226
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,364
Do you also feel like
certain neighbours

227
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,530
are spying on you?

228
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,809
No, not really.

229
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,527
Why?

230
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,405
No, it's nothing.

231
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,006
Bye!
- Bye!

232
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,121
I've won dog food in a raffle recently.

233
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,843
Do you know who owns a dog here?

234
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,843
As far as I know there aren't any pets.

235
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,247
Sorry.

236
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,281
Ah, put it on eBay!
The buyers will even pick it up.

237
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,727
Good idea.
- Bye! - Bye.

238
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,365
I don't want to keep them
waiting with the brunch.

239
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,361
What?

240
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,563
I guess I'd better practice.

241
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,687
Invite Robert and Orhan for dinner.
okay?

242
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,441
Maybe next week?

243
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,521
Huhu!

244
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,167
Hello!

245
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,362
Must have been an extensive brunch.

246
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,690
You know they always
serve loads.

247
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,603
They wouldn't have let me go
without any gift for you.

248
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,362
We had a little too much wine.
hadn't we?

249
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,846
Me? Never.

250
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,807
Just them.

251
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,127
I see.

252
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,960
The smell comes from passive-drinking?
- Exactly.

253
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,407
Greetings from both of them.
They'd love to see our new flat.

254
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,721
How was your day?

255
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,047
Nothing special.

256
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,161
Where is my tiger?

257
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,171
My big one.
dangerous one!

258
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,807
Don't ask me.

259
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,450
I already looked where
he hid himself yesterday.

260
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,321
Pikachu!

261
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,886
He's annoying.

262
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,764
The cat is annoying.
The way he is hiding all the time.

263
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,370
Do you think he doesn't like me?

264
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,411
Bullshit. He's tiny and he's afraid.

265
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,686
That's pretty normal.

266
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,250
Do you think it's stupid
if we return him?

267
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,801
Are you crazy?

268
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,161
Why not?

269
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,686
We won't swap him.
just because he doesn't respond.

270
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,443
Oh! Now look at him!

271
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,130
It will be fine.

272
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,046
Give him some time.

273
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,569
My little tiger.

274
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,849
Whose turn is it?
- Yours!

275
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,884
It's just been her turn.

276
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,365
You're such a smartass!

277
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,571
I'm the winner anyway!

278
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,722
That might be true to some degree.

279
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:39,165
I got that habit from my ex.
Every game ended with him being offended

280
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,486
and then he locked himself
in the bathroom!

281
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,841
You know him.

282
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,528
He was generally
a denier of intelligence.

283
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,207
Why were you with
that "denier"?

284
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,568
Hold on! Was it that certain ex...?

285
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,406
Yep.

286
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,569
Now the question is superfluous.

287
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,129
I had a girlfriend who was
the opposite. She always won.

288
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,648
No matter if she knew the game or not.

289
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,561
No need to bring her to a game party,
'cause nobody would play with her.

290
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,569
Well. Lucky at cards...

291
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,890
One, two, three, oh!

292
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,481
Who has got the yellow one?
- Which ex is that?

293
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,164
Sabine. I'm not sure if you met before.
- The violinist.

294
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,122
He has got a weakness for musicians.
- I knew you would say that!

295
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,289
Well, she is rather pretty.

296
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,247
What is she up to now?
Are you still in touch?

297
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,165
Not really.

298
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,522
Maybe a message on birthdays or so.

299
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,689
What is she doing now?

300
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,244
I think she has finished the academy
and plays in an orchestra.

301
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,445
And which orchestra?

302
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,129
Jessi! If you are keen to know
you should meet her one day.

303
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,730
Not a good idea.
That would be a complete flop!

304
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,571
One might just ask.

305
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,761
Which orchestra?

306
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,569
The philharmonic orchestra.

307
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,647
Coffee anyone? Dessert?

308
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,322
I'll have both.
No coffee for him though.

309
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,251
Or he'll be unbearable all night.
- Yeah, right.

310
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,807
You can sleep on the sofa, again.

311
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,091
So she's stressed out?

312
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,130
Maybe a little tensed-up
because the competition is close.

313
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,721
And...

314
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,687
she thinks
our neighbours are harassing us.

315
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,889
What?
For real?

316
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,801
Like they do in the movies?
- I can hear you!

317
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,725
It isn't a secret, is it?

318
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,489
Nope, but then better show them
the photos on my mobile!

319
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,441
Photos?

320
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,807
Oh no!

321
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,401
That was right after we moved in.

322
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,127
Oh, a warm welcome!
- That's disgusting!

323
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,528
Disgusting indeed, cut it out!

324
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,803
That doesn't mean
you get bullied.

325
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,004
Look, how delicious!

326
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,766
Yummy!

327
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,409
Here you are, sweetie.
- Thanks.

328
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,646
I wanna marry you!

329
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,891
May I, darling?
- I have no objections.

330
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,720
Hey, please, say something!
- Do we know the bride price already?

331
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,364
About the neighbours:
I remember.

332
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,805
Back in school, I used to think
all teachers were against me.

333
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,283
Every bad grade felt like an attack.

334
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,249
I'm uptight with new clients very often,

335
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,524
because they might have a problem
with my sexual orientation.

336
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,691
Well, sometimes fantasy takes off!

337
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,840
Hey... relax!
- I don't need to relax!

338
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,369
What about all the stories
about your imaginations!?

339
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,844
Everyone can have a bad day.

340
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,487
That's true.

341
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,646
You've got the talent. We wouldn't
have nominated you, otherwise.

342
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,650
You just have to go on.

343
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,847
Mentally, too. Especially mentally.

344
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,881
Of course.

345
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,645
I'm sorry to...

346
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,481
Thank you, bye!
- See you on Monday!

347
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,081
Jessica?

348
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,207
Focus on the essence.

349
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,441
Focus on how you feel the music.

350
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,047
I Will.

351
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,921
Hello!
- Hello!

352
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,723
He says it still lacks emotions.

353
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,209
Though I really tried to push
everything aside and...

354
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,648
let myself completely into it but-

355
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,562
Well, maybe it's exactly that:

356
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,971
You shouldn't make such an effort.
- What else then?

357
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,445
Where should I take the feeling from?
- Out of the music.

358
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,767
From inside you.

359
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,602
But the piece is super difficult.

360
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,687
How should I beam myself away...

361
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,691
and be concentrated
completely at the same time?

362
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,889
What if that's all I've got?

363
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,049
What if I can't do it any better?

364
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,766
Hey, Jessi.

365
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,403
You'll make it.

366
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,410
I strongly believe in that.

367
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,726
What is the matter?

368
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,044
I don't want them to hear us.

369
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,891
At least they would know
we're not giving in.

370
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,769
I threw that angel away today.

371
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,765
It was creepy.

372
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,001
That's alright.

373
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,966
We don't have to keep awful gifts.

374
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,290
I know you don't believe me
but this is killing me.

375
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,291
Oh Jessi.
For how long will this go on?

376
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,524
I'm tiring, ain't I?

377
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,611
But since we moved here
you started nagging.

378
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,407
Just because things are going on here!

379
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,606
You're gone all day.
you don't realize it.

380
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,803
No surprise you don't believe me.

381
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,246
Listen:

382
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:56,523
Would it be of any help if I stayed
at home with you for two or three days?

383
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,886
Do you really mean it?

384
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,801
I stay with you if it helps.

385
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,368
You're just saying it,
so that I'm willing?

386
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,691
Of course!
- I know you, darling.

387
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:22,523
Hurry! The bus is coming!
- Bye! - Bye!

388
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,404
As I said: One can feel
when you open up to the music.

389
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,930
What I have heard today,
was one of the best interpretations

390
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,004
I ever heard from students.

391
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,244
I really don't exaggerate.

392
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,566
If today was the competition...

393
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,924
No one could have competed with you!

394
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,041
Pikachu! Have you been waiting?

395
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,365
Why is the door open?

396
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,521
Hey sweetie?

397
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:13,761
How was your day?

398
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,926
Any more disasters?

399
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,485
Jessi! Hey!

400
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,731
Really, I have no idea.

401
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,604
All I know is I got home
from the academy and felt sick.

402
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,447
Then nothing. A blackout.

403
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,442
You body says: Rest.

404
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,081
You've got to listen
to your body, Jessi.

405
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,085
Where is my little one?

406
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:02,242
I just wanted to ask:
Have you noticed anything?

407
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,850
No, no. I haven't seen anything.
- Okay, thanks.

408
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,206
Hello
- Hello.

409
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,484
Sorry for disturbing you but...

410
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,650
our kitten is missing somehow-

411
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,087
Oh no!

412
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,728
Yes, have you seen him?

413
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,920
I'm afraid no, I'm sorry.
- Okay, though thank you.

414
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,961
Hello Mrs. Domweber.

415
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,527
One question: Our kitten is missing.
I would like to ask if maybe you...

416
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,804
Oh no! Which kitten?

417
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,004
Well, our kitten.
Remember?

418
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,889
We brought a kitten two weeks ago...

419
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,210
Ah well, yes, that kitten.
Now I remember, pardon me.

420
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,846
No, we haven't seen it.

421
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,007
Though I'll keep my eyes and ears open!

422
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,171
Oh! Wait a moment!

423
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,724
You must have dropped it.
I picked it out of the garbage.

424
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,163
No need to be embarrassed.
Now it's as good as new!

425
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:33,767
Thanks.

426
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,327
But...

427
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,409
You know, it doesn't fit to us.

428
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:52,449
I know you wanted
that's very kind but...

429
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,331
I don't know how to say...

430
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,766
Thanks a lot, but you should keep it.
- So?

431
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,521
Fine.

432
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:11,327
Missing

433
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:15,687
Pikachu!

434
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,601
Pikachu!

435
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,929
You gotta go outside!

436
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,444
You can already smell the snow!

437
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,925
It won't be long.

438
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,369
Do you think he is still alive?

439
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:56,967
What?

440
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,801
The kitten.
Do you think it's alive?

441
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:05,647
I hope so.

442
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,804
Do you think they are involved?

443
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,207
Who?

444
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:15,727
Them!

445
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,166
Jessi, why should any...

446
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:27,650
Come on!
I just met the Domwebers in the hallway.

447
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,480
They are nice people.
They asked about him.

448
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,483
They are alright.
We should invite them over for dinner.

449
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,721
You can't be serious.

450
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,370
I guess that's often the case:

451
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:44,448
Misunderstandings occur
because people don't know each other.

452
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,411
What? Misunderstandings?
Are you nuts?

453
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,604
Just consider getting to know them
a bit better...

454
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,246
Lorenz! I don't want to!

455
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,203
I don't want to get to know them better.
I don't want them here.

456
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,326
Well, fine that it has worked out!
Please, come in!

457
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:04,089
Our flat is still a bit improvised.

458
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,930
I can imagine.

459
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:09,682
But it's good as it is now!
We rarely have guests.

460
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,849
May I?
- No thanks, I often feel a bit cold.

461
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,565
The heater is on, young lady.

462
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,962
Please!
- Oh, thanks a lot!

463
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,567
Come in!

464
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,282
I take the dusty thing to an expert.

465
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,647
He looks at me with big eyes.
You know what he said?

466
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,009
"That's a repeating pistol...

467
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:41,488
Collectors would pay a fortune for it."
He made me an offer.

468
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,930
But I said: "No, thanks!".

469
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,448
It might be our old age assurance.

470
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,244
If anything happens I can still sell it.

471
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:54,122
The value won't decrease.
On the contrary.

472
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,369
You are fooling yourself!

473
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:02,450
That's the magazine.

474
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,801
Now the action spring is tight.

475
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,365
That has been opened,
the bullets go in here.

476
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,767
Then it's done this way.
the action spring over the bullets.

477
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:21,361
It stayed here like this
because of the bullets...

478
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,210
And then...

479
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:27,163
the repeating
mechanism was activated.

480
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,204
Sharp!
So.

481
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,124
Bullets were inside.
The action spring was tight.

482
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,211
Hilde is scared by it!

483
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:41,842
But I'm always saying:
What could happen?

484
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:46,287
The thing is a hundred years old.
It won't work anymore.

485
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:50,643
I see, it doesn't work any more?
- What do you think?

486
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,764
So. Ready?

487
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,841
Erm... may I use your bathroom?
- Next to the kitchen on the right.

488
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,089
Thanks!
- The light switch is outside!

489
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,969
Please, have a seat!
Lorenz, maybe you sit here?

490
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:04,681
Thank you!

491
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:10,609
What is your profession?
- I'm a physiotherapist.

492
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,645
You heard that, Helmut?

493
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:04,729
I think they were three, right?
- Yes, but the oldest had left home.

494
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,204
Thanks.
- You don't want?

495
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:12,450
I can't handle much alcohol.
- Some more ice cream?

496
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,963
I can get some more if you want.
- Thank you.

497
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:19,850
I remember what I wanted to ask:

498
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:23,090
Which nice piece of music
is it you always play?

499
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,811
Can you hear that?

500
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:28,644
Actually I'm always
playing the quiet cello at home.

501
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,048
No problem.
Sometimes very slightly.

502
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,209
Don't worry. I really love to hear it.

503
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:39,126
It's Bach.
Suite No. 5.

504
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:44,608
Bach it is!
The fifth suite. Beautiful.

505
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:50,249
Very beautiful. And you?
Do you love Bach, too?

506
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,362
Well, to be honest,
only because of Jessi.

507
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,161
How did you get
our kitten's necklace?

508
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,161
Pardon?

509
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,727
I found it in your kitchen.

510
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,409
The one with the tiny bell.
- Jessi!

511
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,125
I don't understand.

512
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,767
What have you been looking for
in our kitchen?

513
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,531
What are you talking about?

514
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,963
That's where you're watching me from, right?
- Jessi!

515
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,482
But you know you're a guest here.
Don't you?

516
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,970
Please excuse!
She can't handle that much alcohol.

517
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:32,486
And she's very stressed lately
due to the competition in Moscow.

518
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:37,047
And the thing with our little cat
bothers her, too.

519
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,563
Jessi, I think it's time to leave now.

520
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,246
I'm not drunk.

521
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,409
I want to know
what's going on here.

522
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:48,243
Why is the necklace
in your kitchen? Where is our cat?

523
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,403
Maybe it's better
you leave now.

524
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,127
No, she should show us
what she has found.

525
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:56,647
Please.

526
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,401
But it was there.

527
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,167
Lorenz!

528
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,968
Come on, it's been a long day. Let's go.

529
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,084
What's the matter, Jessi?

530
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,246
Hey, come on.

531
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:40,766
Lie down again.

532
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,241
Fuck, it's all wet.

533
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,724
I'll get you something, hm?
Back in a second.

534
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,131
I gotta go.

535
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,610
Have a rest, sweetie.

536
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,321
Hello?
- Morning!

537
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,562
The door downstairs was wide open.
We're here for the pick-up.

538
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:04,323
First of all: Our sincere condolences
for your painful loss.

539
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,287
What...?

540
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:09,406
Koenig, undertaker Friedenreich.
We got a call.

541
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,485
So, where is the deceased?

542
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,408
Are you sure you got the right address?

543
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,047
Amann and Klug?

544
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:20,681
And who died?

545
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,647
It's written on here!

546
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,490
Klug. Jessica.

547
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:39,650
Hello Jessi!

548
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,045
Did you hear what I said?

549
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:53,007
I said: I called the undertakers.

550
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:56,122
They said they had no pick-up today.

551
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:36,407
Yes, please?

552
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,569
It's because of the laundry room.

553
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:42,561
There's laundry in the
washing machine for days. Is it yours?

554
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:44,607
Oh, yes, that's...

555
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,730
I forgot... I'm sorry.

556
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:27,561
Open!

557
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,561
What's it about?
- What have you done to my cat?

558
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:34,205
What did you - Open the fucking door!

559
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:38,640
Have you gone completely insane?

560
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,606
What's your problem with me?

561
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:46,486
Yeah, watch this!

562
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:49,441
The old trout is picking on me
since we moved in!

563
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:51,889
You know what she did to my cat?

564
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:55,764
She killed her! In the washing machine!

565
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,086
Hey, Jessi!

566
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:04,446
She killed our cat!
In the washing machine, Lorenz!

567
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,721
And none of you jerks
have seen anything?

568
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:12,161
Nobody knows a thing!

569
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:17,724
She wants to get rid of us
since we moved in!

570
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:20,366
You know what?

571
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:24,167
She sent
fucking undertakers after me!

572
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:30,090
But you can play this
fucking psycho-game all by yourself!

573
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:33,404
I'm not moving! I swear!
You evil witch!

574
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:39,766
And you!

575
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,371
You think I'm crazy, right?

576
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:49,043
Anyone else wants us to move out?

577
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:52,285
Call out, right now!

578
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,569
And we discuss it.

579
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:02,801
No one?

580
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,001
Jessi!

581
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,769
We need some quiet again, huh?

582
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:20,566
I've been thinking.

583
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:26,523
I guess we better move out.
The flat doesn't do us any good.

584
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,801
You mean, it doesn't do me
any good, right?

585
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:33,967
No, Jessi.
I'm talking about the two of us.

586
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,280
You want to give up.

587
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,126
I'm not giving up, Jessi.

588
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:47,129
It's not a...
- What?

589
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:51,361
They want to wear us down
and you're giving in.

590
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:56,210
But that isn't a fight, Jessi.

591
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:05,241
I want to live here.
With you. And at peace.

592
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,967
So why should we let them
bully us out of here?

593
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:09,930
They should move out!

594
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:14,365
I won't let myself being defeated.
Don't you see?

595
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,401
It isn't just about the flat,
it's much more.

596
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,649
It's about our attitude towards life:

597
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:23,522
Always giving up or fighting for once!

598
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:26,362
It's about us. Don't you get that?

599
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,804
I won't allow them to ruin us.

600
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:39,289
Jessi, you lost...
- What?

601
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:50,283
You lost control over it.
- Me?

602
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:53,846
You're blind.
You don't realize what's going on!

603
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,281
Fine, then I'm blind.

604
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,286
Jessi, I don't feel
like arguing with you.

605
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:07,842
You rather apologize than speaking
your mind. I'm sick of that, Lorenz.

606
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,965
Otherwise I wouldn't have
any space beside you, Jessi!

607
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:15,243
Imagine I'd act like you do.
Always head against the wall!

608
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:17,925
Jessi, this wouldn't work.

609
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,565
And that's okay, really.

610
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:30,160
I can deal with it.

611
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:32,680
No problem at all.

612
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:36,690
I'm here for you, too, Jessi.

613
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,608
But I don't know. I...

614
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,922
I feel like...

615
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:51,970
I'm losing you.

616
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:56,729
You're just...

617
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:59,083
Now you also believe that I'm crazy.

618
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:05,321
How long do you know me by now?
Have I ever claimed such a thing before?

619
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,204
Who do you believe?

620
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:13,326
Me or them?

621
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,765
Hey, Jessi, that's...

622
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:35,000
You're under extreme pressure
at the moment.

623
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:43,760
I'm trying to help you but...

624
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:53,164
I don't know anymore...

625
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:56,807
what do to.

626
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,002
I gotta get out of here, Jessi.

627
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:21,126
You should come with me. Please.

628
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,485
Where do you want to go?

629
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:31,886
I don't know.

630
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:35,166
Back to Philipp's or so,
for the time being.

631
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:42,727
Okay.

632
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:53,766
But I stay.

633
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:43,402
Don't say that you've slept until now.

634
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:45,520
I did, somehow.

635
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:51,970
But you still remember that we wanted
to make some cookies together?

636
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,368
Of course.
- Good.

637
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,248
Another customer came in
and was all confused

638
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:59,563
because there was no one there...

639
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:04,447
Jessi?

640
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,607
I'm sorry, I have lots to do.

641
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,451
You have to leave.

642
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:31,445
I'm sorry for you.

643
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:52,927
If you want I'll nominate you once more.
Next year, once you... Well-

644
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:55,211
But for now...

645
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:59,641
We believe it's not the right time.

646
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:05,408
That you forgot two appointments.

647
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:08,688
Well, I think that...

648
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:13,848
That shows you're are lost
in thoughts at the moment.

649
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:18,121
You should calm down.

650
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:28,249
Who will play now instead of me?

651
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,045
Sayoko.

652
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:47,565
I'm sorry.

653
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,450
Helmut! Take the garbage out!

654
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:49,123
Oh my god! You scared me!

655
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:52,924
Can't you knock the door?

656
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:56,162
I'm sorry, I
- It's alright.

657
01:18:57,520 --> 01:18:58,567
What do you want?

658
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,091
Because of last time...

659
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:08,281
It's very awkward for me,
what I said back then.

660
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,450
I want to apologize...

661
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:13,881
You know...

662
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:19,691
I've so many things on my mind lately

663
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,444
and I'm not feeling that well...

664
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:32,007
It's very awkward, what I said to you.

665
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:34,521
Forget about it.

666
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,369
We'll talk about it some other time.

667
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:43,247
Come on.

668
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,240
Take a rest!

669
01:19:58,520 --> 01:19:59,601
No.

670
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:01,521
No!

671
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:05,250
Why are you doing that?
That's not very kind.

672
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:10,127
I made the way up here
to apologize and you kick me out.

673
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,929
That isn't nice.
You should accept my apology.

674
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:19,442
It isn't easy at all for me, either,
after all that has happened.

675
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:21,247
No!

676
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:23,371
I could be upset, too.

677
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,881
Now, are you completely nuts?

678
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,729
Leave! Now!

679
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:32,208
Not until we have straightened this out.

680
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:38,841
Let's sit down now and we both calm down.
- No!

681
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:46,841
Please.

682
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:49,364
Let's sit down for a moment.

683
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:01,651
Look, the way I see it,

684
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:04,202
there are three options:

685
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,881
The first one: We give in and move out.

686
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:08,646
Then you get what you want.

687
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,331
But I don't like that one.

688
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:14,168
The second one:
You move out and we stay here.

689
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:16,683
But you wouldn't want that, for sure.

690
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:21,727
Well.
so only the third option is left...

691
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,290
The garbage men slammed
the containers against the wall,

692
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:28,926
all the tiles fell off.

693
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,171
Ah! There is...

694
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,921
Hello, your wife and I
just sat down together.

695
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:37,728
Aw, so you haven't...

696
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:40,442
Would you like some coffee or tea?

697
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,928
She was about to leave.
Actually.

698
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:48,003
Yes, that's true but... okay.

699
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:51,963
Coffee? Or tea?
- Tea, please. Thank you.

700
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:02,011
So what's it all about?

701
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:06,120
The three of us will discuss
the problem for good.

702
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:27,084
May I help you?
- No, no. That's fine.

703
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:12,967
So.

704
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:20,967
That's the water for tea.
- Thanks.

705
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:23,971
Our kettle does only three cups.
So you have to...

706
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:26,041
That old thing...

707
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:31,608
Put that into the socket behind you...
And then put it in there...

708
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:36,846
We haven't got one of these
Nespresso-machines like everyone has.

709
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:41,683
Coffee is an own form of art
with an own philosophy.

710
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:45,727
Everyone has different preferences.

711
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:48,447
And you don't drink any coffee?
- I do.

712
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,201
Not that often.
and only espresso.

713
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:56,207
So you're ahead
of all these filter coffee people!

714
01:23:56,760 --> 01:24:00,765
The paper filter keeps all these
fine oils, they can't get through,

715
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:02,724
that are important
for the taste.

716
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:07,370
All these aromas!
They stick to the paper!

717
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:10,170
Like a gold filter.

718
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:12,080
Just learnt something.

719
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:16,283
Do you know the so-called
"Karlsbader Kanne"?

720
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:18,360
Many count on it!

721
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:20,966
I say:

722
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:24,085
If you have the time, go ahead.

723
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:26,245
The aroma is really good.

724
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:28,684
Is it worth the effort?

725
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:32,324
You have to pour the hot water

726
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,929
little by little over the coffee.

727
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:37,647
And the coffee has to be coarse ground.

728
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,401
Do you want to try some of my coffee?

729
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:44,081
Wait a minute, I'll get you a...
- No!

730
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:47,724
She's leaving now!
I want you to leave.

731
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:49,447
Right now!

732
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:58,167
Hilde!

733
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:05,881
Hilde!

734
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,924
We said we're going
to talk about our problems.

735
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,290
Leave my wife alone!
Come on!

736
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:22,165
You have to leave my wife alone!

737
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:25,846
Leave my wife alone!
Damnit!

738
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:46,367
Helmut!

739
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,047
Helmut!

740
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:01,007
Help!

741
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:03,449
Help! Please...

742
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:57,367
Oh no! Now you have
a burn mark in your carpet.

743
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:25,041
I just came here to apologize.

744
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:29,051
I wanted to propose a fresh start.

745
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:34,326
And now this!
Was that necessary?!

746
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:57,166
You know what?

747
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:02,809
I think this is never, never,
never, never going to stop.

748
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:09,803
You won't ever let us alone, will you?

749
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:23,365
Okay, now it's quiet again.

750
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:26,051
We have peace at home again.

751
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:36,961
No!

752
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:41,407
Jessi!

753
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:52,727
Help!

754
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:57,561
Jessi!

755
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:00,560
So hurry, please! Yes, I'll stay here!

756
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:36,406
May I help you?

757
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:43,925
For our neighbours

758
01:33:44,305 --> 01:33:50,473
