Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese

2
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:07,909
Peek-a-boo!

3
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:10,658
No, no, no, no, no.

4
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,866
I didn't mean to startle
you, my little baby.

5
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:16,043
Shh, Shh, shh.

6
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:28,096
A-bitty goo-bah!

7
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,515
I vant to kiss your tush.

8
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:32,601
I vant to kiss your tush!

9
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,782
Nice, but maybe a little
more square footage.

10
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:50,907
I want a lot of monsters here.

11
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:59,207
I'm gonna
get you, little Mavis.

12
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,505
I'm gonna get you! Oy.

13
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,379
What out there?

14
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,837
Oh, we never go out there.

15
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,262
Ever.

16
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:14,928
"And then the monsters ran away
and were forced into hiding."

17
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,856
"But Harry the Human found them and
jumped out from under their bed."

18
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,274
I'm scared!
"And burned their clothes

19
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,318
and bit their toes!"

20
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,487
"And took their candy!"

21
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,400
Don't take my candy.

22
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:32,453
Babyclaws, you don't
need to be frightened.

23
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:37,249
I promised your mommy
I would protect you forever.

24
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,661
Just bend the legs
and push off.

25
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,830
Trust me, mouse.

26
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,084
Ha-ha!
I can fly! I can fly!

27
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,206
Look at you!

28
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,832
Faster, baby! Faster!

29
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,381
Whoo-hoo! You got it,
my little voodoo doll!

30
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,222
Excuse me, sir.

31
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,890
What? What?

32
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,843
Ow. I'm okay.

33
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,678
It's ready.

34
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,106
Looks good.

35
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,058
Only monsters can get in?

36
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,564
Oh, absolutely.

37
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,441
It's hidden real nicely.

38
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,444
You got 400 acres of haunted
forest in front of you.

39
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:54,402
You got the Land of the
Undead on the perimeters.

40
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:59,081
Any humans daring to even look over
there will run away real quick.

41
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,096
But, of course, be smart.

42
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:17,595
No bonfires, no firework shows.

43
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,553
Yeah, yeah, no, no. No
fire, I get it, I get it.

44
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,187
It's time, my darling Martha.

45
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,691
The place we always
talked about for Mavis.

46
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,774
No one will ever harm her here.

47
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,794
Yeah, it's a mess back there.

48
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:45,809
Welcome to Hotel Transylvania!

49
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,358
Human-free since 1898.

50
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,980
Your safest destination.

51
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,277
Take an itinerary.

52
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,277
I have personally designed a
spectacular schedule of events,

53
00:05:56,356 --> 00:06:00,202
all leading to my daughter's
birthday extravaganza tomorrow.

54
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,575
We always look forward
to coming every year, Count.

55
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,497
We enjoy the safety so much.

56
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,833
Of course. That's
why we built it.

57
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,167
Yes, good evening.

58
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:09,662
Thank you, Marty.

59
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,039
You look pale, as well.

60
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,710
Sir, sir, sir!

61
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,258
We have an urgent
plumbing issue.

62
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,630
Plumbing? On it.

63
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,712
Mr. Ghouligan!

64
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,924
There is a clogged
toilet in room 348.

65
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,681
It's okay. We all get
stomach aches, Mr. Bigfoot.

66
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,944
Hey, kids, reel it in.

67
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,398
You're only supposed to
make Mom and Dad miserable.

68
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,525
Now, now, is that
any way to behave?

69
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,953
This is a hotel,
not a cemetery.

70
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,030
Sorry, Uncle Drac.

71
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,199
Drac! How are ya?

72
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:48,625
Wayne, my old friend!

73
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,043
Couldn't wait for this weekend.

74
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,041
Always great to be out of the
shadows for a couple days.

75
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,588
The family looks beautiful.

76
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,461
Let me just clean
up their filth.

77
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,712
Housekeeping!

78
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,485
Frankie, my boy!
Look at you!

79
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,858
Still traveling by mail,
Mr. Cheapo, huh?

80
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,110
It's not a money thing.

81
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,657
I have a plane phobia, okay?

82
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,732
I mean, at any moment,
those engines could catch...

83
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,244
Fire! Yeah, yeah.

84
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,662
"Fire bad."

85
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,660
We know.

86
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,162
Augustus, Porridge
Head, come on!

87
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,289
Does that look like
Frankenstein's head?

88
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,042
Hey, Drac, buddy, what's going
on with your cape there?

89
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,212
What do you
mean? Oh!

90
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,585
Who pinched me?

91
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,633
Guilty. You're irresistible.

92
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,927
Yes, very amusing,
Invisible Man.

93
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:44,006
Hello. Great to "see" you.

94
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,432
Never gets old.

95
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,597
Ho-ho-ho.

96
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:49,769
Missed me.

97
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:51,684
Missed me, missed me, missed me.

98
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,857
Okay, you win.
Hold this bacon.

99
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,230
Why am I holding
bacon... Ahh!

100
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,936
No! Get 'em off!

101
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:05,785
Here comes the party!

102
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:07,954
Hello, Murray!

103
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,997
Drac, what's up, buddy?

104
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,996
The sand, Murray, the sand!

105
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,372
Always with the sand.

106
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,703
Whee!

107
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,081
Wolfie! Wanda! Frank!

108
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,585
I love this guy.

109
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,387
He always bringing
it full tilt.

110
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,759
You're looking skinny, too.

111
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,637
Now that you're just a head.

112
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:30,094
Okay, you'll pay for that.

113
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,346
So what's up, Drac?

114
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,353
The hotel is looking
off the hook.

115
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,772
Hey, guys, watch this.

116
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,363
By the way, you were right
about those directions.

117
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:43,486
Oh, good, good.

118
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,158
Yeah, I took the Tigris

119
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:48,112
through the Nile, and there
was absolutely no traffic.

120
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,706
You're kidding me.

121
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,128
Right in my lobby?

122
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,956
Drac, I swear, man,
I don't run like that.

123
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,466
Housekeeping!

124
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,935
I was not the cause of that.

125
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,271
We're ready!

126
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,694
If only Martha were
here to see this.

127
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,148
She's always here, Wanda.

128
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,607
Okay, friends,

129
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,785
I am so glad you are
here to celebrate.

130
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,034
Another birthday for
my sweet little Mavis,

131
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:36,789
and another successful year
of refuge from them!

132
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,171
These are recent human images

133
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,416
our surveillance has uncovered.

134
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:45,753
They are getting fatter
so as to overpower us.

135
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,837
And they are wearing
less clothing,

136
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,090
allowing more
movement to strangle us

137
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:53,268
or cut open our heads
and put candy in them.

138
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,845
But they will never

139
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,186
find us here.

140
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,602
Evil villain,
you will never win!

141
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,355
Okie doke. The fun
starts in 30 minutes.

142
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,524
Right now, I have
to see my little girl.

143
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:05,443
She's not so little any more!

144
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:06,614
Yes, she is!

145
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,448
What's going on out there?

146
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,121
Are we at the hotel?

147
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:16,291
Frank, did you book us
for a tandem massage?

148
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,539
Did you get us a
table at Hunchback's?

149
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,162
Did you do anything?

150
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,623
You're welcome.

151
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,706
What's going on?

152
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,463
Dad, you said that

153
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:29,387
when I turned 118, I could
go out into the world

154
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:32,383
like every other adult that gets
to come and go from this hotel.

155
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:35,135
"But, Mavey Wavey, it's not safe.
Bleh, bleh-bleh."

156
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,562
Dad, 30 years ago,
you promised.

157
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,477
I remember, we were
both eating mice,

158
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,979
and you specifically said
that you gave me your word.

159
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,568
Do not disturb.

160
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:48,906
Do not disturb.
Do not disturb.

161
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,074
Do not disturb.

162
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,443
Do not disturb.
Do not disturb.

163
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,662
Do not disturb. Good
morning, Your Eminence.

164
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,909
Maid, clean up this room!

165
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,747
It's you. Glad you
could make it.

166
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,996
Is she up yet?
Oh, she's up.

167
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:06,754
She's ready to go. And by "go," I mean go.
As in, go check the world out.

168
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,756
What you gonna do?
What you gonna say?

169
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:12,256
I got it covered. Please, relax.
Just do your job.

170
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,262
Good morning, Mavey Wavey!

171
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,264
Happy birthday,
my little mouse!

172
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,511
Thank you, Dad.

173
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,268
I know it's my birthday.

174
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,857
I have so much fun planned.
Whoo-hoo!

175
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,776
But first, we go catch
some scorpions together,

176
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,612
just the two of us,
yes, dead-ums?

177
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,777
Dad, please, let me speak.

178
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,525
There's something
we have to talk about.

179
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:34,031
You want to go out
into the world. You can.

180
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,202
Aha!

181
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:36,621
I knew you were gonna say that.

182
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,536
But, Dad, you gave
me your word,

183
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:41,118
and you know that I know that
a Dracula's word is sacred.

184
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,794
That our trust is
the core of our...

185
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:43,961
Wait, what?

186
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,459
I said you can go.

187
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,797
You're just playing with me.

188
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,464
No, no, no, no. You're old
enough to drive a hearse now,

189
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,552
you're old enough to
make your own choices.

190
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:52,880
You can go.

191
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,761
Holy rabies!
Holy rabies!

192
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,221
Whoa, whoa. Stop.

193
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,148
Wait a second, sweetfangs.

194
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,567
Where are you going?

195
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,565
Oh, well, I'm
going to paradise,

196
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,988
and this is just some stuff
that I thought I would need.

197
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,316
Paradise?
Yeah, you know.

198
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,992
It's that place out there
where you and Mom met.

199
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,326
Auntie Wanda says you two

200
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,325
were just like, Zing!

201
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,993
I don't know from "Zing."

202
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,912
Where did you find that card?

203
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,493
In one of your drawers.

204
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,419
Why won't you ever tell me
about how you met?

205
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:26,997
It's actually Hawaii.

206
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,172
Ha-what-what?

207
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,334
Look, honey,
I know you're excited,

208
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:35,009
but everyone has gone to great lengths
to come see you on your birthday.

209
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,599
I know. They always do.

210
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,601
But aren't I getting a little
old for these parties?

211
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:44,432
I love them, but I really
want to see new things.

212
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,608
Maybe meet somebody my age.

213
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,357
Come on. No,
no, don't do that.

214
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,939
Don't give me
the pouty batface.

215
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,359
Okay, there is a human village

216
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,819
just a little ways
past the cemetery.

217
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,997
You could go there and be back
in, like, 30 minutes or so.

218
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:03,996
It should be plenty
for your first time.

219
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,954
Well, it's not
Ha-wee-wee, but I guess

220
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,664
it's still technically
out there.

221
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,216
Okay, okay, okay!

222
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:17,763
Thanks for trusting me.

223
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,507
Of course, my little one.

224
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,558
I gave you my word.

225
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,311
Hey, honey!

226
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:25,980
Look at this!
Hey, guys.

227
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,932
You excited about tomorrow?

228
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,650
Not as excited
as I am right now.

229
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,649
You're not gonna believe
this, but Dad is letting me

230
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,480
go out on my own
to see a human village!

231
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:34,610
What?
No!

232
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,779
Excuse me. Drac!

233
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:37,991
Have you lost it?

234
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,660
Letting your own
daughter out there

235
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,239
with those horrible humans
you always tell us about?

236
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,416
That's why you
built this place.

237
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,458
They hate us.
They're vicious.

238
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,374
And they're very loud!

239
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,797
Auntie Eunice, maybe
they've changed.

240
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,541
I'm just gonna fly down the
street and see how it goes.

241
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,501
Okay, honey, be safe.

242
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,462
Bring warm clothes and a sword.

243
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:58,804
And look out for pitchforks.

244
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,140
Don't you let anyone scoop
your brains out, either.

245
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,474
Maybe stay in the shadows.

246
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,890
It's more fun to just
observe from under a house.

247
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,767
Guys, guys.
She can handle it.

248
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,065
She's a Dracula,
for Pete's sake.

249
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,484
But seriously,
watch out for fire.

250
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,444
Fire bad.

251
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:24,865
Bye, everyone.

252
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,457
Whoo-hoo!

253
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,550
Whoo-hoo!

254
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:40,763
Drac, I can't believe how calm
you are about her leaving.

255
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,260
I'm proud of you.

256
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,559
Drac? Drac?

257
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,477
Where did Drac go?

258
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:51,474
Whoo-hoo!

259
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,561
This is awesome!

260
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,899
There's the cemetery,
just like Dad said.

261
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,204
Whoo-hoo!

262
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,725
Uh... Hello?

263
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,112
Anybody out there?

264
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,828
Vampire.
Bite toes!

265
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:50,999
Oh!

266
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,702
Hi, humans.

267
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:59,168
Everything okay? My name
is Mavis Dracula, and I...

268
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,502
Vampire.

269
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,303
- Burn clothes.
- Burn my clothes?

270
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,506
Really? Um...
Vampire!

271
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:08,139
We take your candy.
Candy!

272
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,595
I'm friendly.
I really am.

273
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,722
Calm down, now.
Candy.

274
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,895
I just wanted to say hi.

275
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,318
Please. I've never
hurt anyone.

276
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,413
I'm homeschooled.

277
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,540
Is that garlic?

278
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,849
Holy rabies, you're on fire.

279
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,806
Can I do anything?
Can I help you?

280
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,441
Dad was right.

281
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,436
Dad was right.

282
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,159
It worked.

283
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:14,409
Now my baby will
be safe forever.

284
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,088
All right, everybody,
get back to work now.

285
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,589
Hey. You don't
need a mannequin.

286
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,639
Leave the mannequin
here. Come on.

287
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,244
Where you been?

288
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,163
Why you sneaking around?

289
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,412
Shh. Quiet.

290
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:59,246
Sweetheart, have you
returned so soon?

291
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,580
Oh. Come in, Dad.

292
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,586
How'd it go?
How was the big world?

293
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,292
How was it out there?

294
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,627
It was okay, Dad.

295
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,303
What? What's the matter?

296
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,130
Dad, you were right.

297
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,681
Humans are awful.

298
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,508
They were everything you said.

299
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,806
They wanted to bite my toes.
Your toes?

300
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,933
And they had garlic on bread.

301
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,981
What? Look at me.

302
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:22,560
I'm getting goose bumps,
I'm so scared.

303
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,647
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

304
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:29,280
I hate that you
had to see that.

305
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,861
I'm so sorry I doubted you.

306
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:36,245
I'll never leave here again.

307
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:39,624
Okay. Okay.

308
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:44,378
Look, Daddy's going to make you
the bestest birthday ever.

309
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:45,800
Look what I brought you.

310
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,718
Your wormcakes.

311
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,971
Don't be sad any more.

312
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:55,553
Remember, this is the year we
open Mommy's present for you.

313
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,228
What did she get me?

314
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:58,475
We'll see.

315
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:02,730
She said never to open
until you're 118.

316
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,685
We've waited this long.

317
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,066
You eat your wormcakes.

318
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,194
You come down whenever
you're ready, honey.

319
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,153
Phew.
Ooh.

320
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,452
What did you do?

321
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,620
What I had to.

322
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,827
Mm-hmm.

323
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,494
She'll thank me one day.

324
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:22,078
Yeah, that's what the guy
who shrunk my head said.

325
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,218
Ahh.

326
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,597
Yes, what do you
want, a cookie?

327
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:37,848
You did all right, man.

328
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,179
Move on already.

329
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:44,900
Phew!

330
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,192
Yeah.

331
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,694
Vampire! Vampire!

332
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:52,116
A human.

333
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,121
Who are you? And how did
you find this place?

334
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,573
Oh, I'm Jonathan.

335
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:00,656
And I was just mountain
climbing with some dudes...

336
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,249
...and heard this story about
a spooky forest.

337
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:09,884
And who's not going to go
into a spooky forest, right?

338
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:15,389
So, then I see these
goofy-looking dudes on fire-

339
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:21,938
And I just kind of followed them
to this, like, amazing castle.

340
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,316
But, of course, be smart.

341
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:28,395
No bonfires, no firework shows.

342
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,106
How many of you are there?
Just me.

343
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,485
I like to hit it alone.

344
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,659
You meet so many awesome
people in the youth hostels.

345
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:38,614
Hey, speaking of awesome,
that cape thing is killing it.

346
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:40,448
Is there, like,
a costume party here?

347
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:41,657
What have I done?

348
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,414
This is all my fault.

349
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,336
You have to leave.

350
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,458
- Oh, no.
- Excuse me.

351
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,174
One of your piranhas
in the lake is very rude.

352
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,796
He ate my sister-in-law.

353
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:53,298
Be right with you.

354
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:57,007
Mr. Dracula, we asked for a
room with a view of the pool.

355
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,966
The room's fine. We
want to book a massage.

356
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,221
Yes, Swedish.
Shiatsu.

357
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:01,644
Aromatherapy.
Lower back.

358
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:02,845
Do you have hot-stone?
We want a massage.

359
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,601
I'll get back to you, Mr. Hydraberg.
I hope so.

360
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,023
I doubt it.
See that you do.

361
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,896
That's Ms. Hydraberg.
Thanks.

362
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,860
Yes, nice to see you. JONATHAN:
Dude, seriously, what's up?

363
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,608
It's kind of funky
to breathe under here.

364
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:14,315
Drac. Hey, Drac.
How'd it go with Mavey?

365
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,696
Hey. Where'd you go?

366
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,287
Wow!

367
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,285
This room's kind of
small for a big castle.

368
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,243
No bed, but check out these
awesome dustpans they give you.

369
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,744
Quiet, you fool.

370
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:29,000
What weapons are you keeping
in this container?

371
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,672
Your pitchforks?

372
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,340
Oh!

373
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,918
I can't breathe.

374
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,503
It's killing me.

375
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,135
Yeah, definitely due
for a fluff and fold.

376
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,575
What is this?

377
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,807
A torture device?

378
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,556
A secret mind controller?

379
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,478
You won't read my thoughts.

380
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,770
I won't let you.

381
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,439
Dude, it's just music.

382
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:48,812
Here, try it.

383
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,811
Ohh!

384
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:54,773
It's taking my soul!

385
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,905
What? It's a good jam.
Don't be a grandpa.

386
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,486
You need to go.

387
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:05,450
No human has ever entered this castle.
And if someone should see you,

388
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:11,506
the safety of the hotel, the sanctuary,
no one would ever come again.

389
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,548
Yeah, go for it.

390
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:15,592
"Ever come again!"

391
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:19,047
I love your Dracula voice.
It's so over the top.

392
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:23,760
And Mavis, if she saw you, she
would know that I lied. No!

393
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,720
Who's Mavis?
Is this her room?

394
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:26,895
I'm good with a roommate.

395
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:29,132
I had six brothers growing
up, sol could totally share.

396
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,265
I can't kill him.

397
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,522
It would set monsters back
hundreds of years.

398
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,274
One time, in Hamburg,
I roomed with this dude

399
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,855
who I caught stealing
my shampoo.

400
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:39,192
I said, "Whoa, man," and he threw a
flower pot at me, but he was cool.

401
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:40,652
What are you babbling about?

402
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,236
What? Whoa.

403
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,037
Check out these
awesome costumes.

404
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:45,706
Costumes.

405
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:49,544
What's this? Sorry, man. I just
can't be without my backpack.

406
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,163
You know, everything I own's in there.
It'll be right here.

407
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:54,840
Okay, I just...
I love my backpack.

408
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,417
Whoa. Hey, what are you doing?

409
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,502
What are you... What are
you doing to my hair?

410
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,055
Stop. Oh, wait, that tickles.

411
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,349
Come on, man.

412
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:09,017
Check it out.
I'm a Franken-homie.

413
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,894
Yes, hello.
Look at me!

414
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:14,978
This is totally normal, not a problem here.
This is just a monster with me.

415
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,695
Man, everybody
stepped it up tonight.

416
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:20,528
Wait, why are we going to the front door?
Are we leaving?

417
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:22,702
Bonjour, Dracula!

418
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,528
Hey, Sniffy.
What's going on?

419
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:26,455
Not right now, Quasimodo.

420
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,075
What?

421
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,207
No. Don't be absurd.

422
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:35,085
It's not a human,
but Monsieur Dracula.

423
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:37,207
How ridiculous. It's me.

424
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:40,632
Monsieur.

425
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,347
The devilled lizard fingers.
Devilled lizard fingers?

426
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,140
I asked for
spleens-in-blankets.

427
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,263
You ugly fool! I told
you, he doesn't like

428
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:48,845
the lizard fingers!
But you said...

429
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,227
Whoa. Check that costume out.

430
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:57,653
Wow. Seriously, I just have to ask
you: How are you pulling this off?

431
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:59,230
I mean, it looks so real.

432
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,566
Like, I could just put
my hand right through...

433
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,682
What do you think you're doing?

434
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,788
She's real. You're real!

435
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:11,618
Yeah, and I'll give you a real beating.
Keep your hands out of my wife!

436
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:17,165
Oh, no.

437
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,255
Ay-yi-yi-yi!

438
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,542
Honey, I just didn't
know where you were.

439
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,623
We thought you were still out.

440
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:02,301
Oh, no. I don't know why
I ever wanted to leave.

441
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:04,299
The humans are so boring.

442
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:19,560
Mavis, honey,
are you all right?

443
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:22,738
Yeah, I think so.
That was weird.

444
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:24,736
My head hurts.

445
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:26,738
Um, who is that?
Who is what?

446
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:28,410
Oh, that.

447
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,408
That is nobody.

448
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,285
Seriously, Dad?
"Dad"?

449
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:36,164
Yeah, I know, Dracula's daughter.
Everyone freaks out at first.

450
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,415
Dracula?

451
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,586
Okay, we got to go.

452
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,251
Please don't kill me.
I'm so young.

453
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,678
I have so many
places I want to see.

454
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:49,007
I've got tickets to six
Dave Matthews Band concerts.

455
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,966
I'm getting out of here.

456
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,638
Shut up already.

457
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:58,270
It's impossible for me
to think with all your noise.

458
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,567
Sorry, Glen.
Go back to sleep.

459
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:06,782
Wait. Aren't you going to suck my blood?
Classic human paranoia.

460
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:10,828
Human blood is so fatty, and you
never know where it's been.

461
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,656
So, Dracula doesn't
drink blood?

462
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:16,162
No, I use a blood substitute.

463
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:20,542
Either Near Blood or Blood Beaters.
You can't tell the difference.

464
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:23,465
So, wow, you're, like,
the real Count Dracula.

465
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,293
Like, "I'm Dracula.
Bleh, bleh-bleh."

466
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:30,006
I've never said that in my life.
"Bleh, bleh-bleh."

467
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,807
I don't know where
that comes from.

468
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:35,307
Can I just ask, what
exactly is this place?

469
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:37,808
What is this place?

470
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:45,733
It's a place I built for all
those monsters out there,

471
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:51,161
lurking in the shadows, hiding
from the persecution of humankind.

472
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,740
A place for them and their families
to come to and be themselves.

473
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:59,243
A place void of torches,
pitchforks, angry mobs.

474
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:02,588
A place of peace, relaxation

475
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,923
and tranquility.

476
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,088
Cool. So, it's like
a hotel for monsters?

477
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:12,052
Yes, exactly. "A hotel for
monsters." Way to sum it up.

478
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:16,557
Okay, hop on my back.
We're leaving.

479
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,262
Oh, man, you're a bat now.

480
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:20,230
I always wanted to fly.
What's it like?

481
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:23,434
This is insane. Wait.
Wait, I want to stay.

482
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:26,062
Can Frankenstein sign my costume?
Can I meet the Invisible Man?

483
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,614
Hey, if I stuck my hand
in the Invisible Man's mouth,

484
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,277
- would it disappear?
- Hi.

485
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:34,245
Mavey! What are you doing,
my sweet little blood orange?

486
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,367
Our friend was just leaving.

487
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,414
Yeah, he was flying
me out the window.

488
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,035
This guy, he's so funny.

489
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:43,587
Look, you have
something on your face.

490
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:47,417
Play along if you ever want
to see your precious backpack.

491
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:54,049
Whoa. So, wait, you didn't have any
clothes on when you were a bat?

492
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:55,428
Or were they bat-sized?

493
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,635
Who exactly is that?

494
00:27:58,635 --> 00:27:59,978
Hmm. Honeybat.

495
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,268
You see, it's your birthday.

496
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:07,148
And you know I want you to have the
bestest, specialest party of your life.

497
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:10,523
So, well, I needed some help.

498
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:11,823
You needed help?

499
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,319
Well, look, I am very good,
but I thought it would be

500
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:20,792
even more bestest, specialest if someone
closer to your age helped plan the party.

501
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,118
You're my age?
Sure.

502
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,828
Well, how old are you?

503
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:24,999
118.

504
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,872
One hundred and...

505
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,754
Yeah, I'm 121.

506
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,631
Really?
Mm-hmm.

507
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:35,465
You see? Everything
is very, very normal.

508
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,300
I'm throwing a party,
and he's helping.

509
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,681
Sir, there's an emergency.
Not now.

510
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:44,352
Can't you see we're in the middle
of something very normal here?

511
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:45,975
Wait, what's going on here?

512
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:50,313
There's an emergency in your precious
hotel, and you're not running to fix it?

513
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:51,981
Why? Is it because of him?

514
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,907
Whoa, look at my face.

515
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:57,995
No, precious bones,
it's not because of him.

516
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,914
Good. Then go check on the emergency,
and I'll keep him company.

517
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,913
No! Anything but that!
What?

518
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,711
I mean, because
he needs time to plan.

519
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:09,666
And if you're keeping him
company, then he's not planning.

520
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,546
He is company-keeping,

521
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:14,003
and then the plan, it's...
it doesn't get planned.

522
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,425
Mm-hmm. Good one.
Shut up!

523
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:20,601
Okay. So, maybe if you're not
planning later, we can hang out.

524
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:23,225
Sounds good.
Yes. You hear that?

525
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,055
It sounds good.

526
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:29,185
So you will hang out. See you
later, my honey. Lovely.

527
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,649
Okay, you're not hanging out.

528
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,651
Because you are leaving.

529
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,778
But the opposite, you said.

530
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,121
But, sir, the emergency.

531
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,743
Follow me.

532
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:49,379
Boy, that kid smelt.

533
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,835
Where are we going?

534
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,295
Just getting rid of you

535
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:59,131
through a secret tunnel
so she does not see us.

536
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,551
So, can I ask you a question?

537
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,977
Is that real, about
the garlic thing?

538
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,896
Yes, I cannot have it.
My throat swells.

539
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,807
Huh. Wooden stake
to the heart?

540
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,563
Yeah, well, who
wouldn't that kill?

541
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,116
Ah. Here we go.

542
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,747
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm a little lost.

543
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,329
Yes, I know it's your honeymoon.
I apologize.

544
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:33,291
Go back to doing
what you were doing.

545
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,213
I'm not down here much.

546
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:42,891
It's meant to be an exit
if humans ever invade.

547
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:46,766
So, I'm, like, the first human here, huh?
That's really cool.

548
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,268
Oh, boy.

549
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,350
I think this is it.

550
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,021
What's happening?
I'm terribly sorry.

551
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:58,524
My mistake. What is
wrong with you people?

552
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,491
Oh, man. This
place is amazing.

553
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,198
Okay, I could really use
some silence right now.

554
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,082
All right, third time's a...

555
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:23,424
Drac.

556
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:25,308
Yes, Frankie?

557
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:26,681
Hey, buddy, what
you been doing?

558
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,977
Don't move.

559
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,805
Never mind that.
What you been doing?

560
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,812
We wanted to practice our
big number for Mavis's party,

561
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,985
and then these losers wouldn't
get off the bandstand.

562
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,733
Okay. Put down
Zombie Mozart,

563
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,405
Bach and Beethoven
this instant.

564
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:45,954
Did you get to rehearse
at all, Zombie Beethoven?

565
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:51,585
Listen, Drac, we wanted to play
something, like old times.

566
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,083
We even thought maybe
you'd sing with us.

567
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:58,463
Come on, fellas. You know that I
haven't sung in public since Martha.

568
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,795
Yeah, but we just thought how much,
you know, Mavis would love it.

569
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:01,969
I said no!

570
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,171
Don't ask me again!

571
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:06,801
Okay. Now, let's hug the zombies.
Let's all make up.

572
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,432
Wow. He really scared you.
I wasn't scared.

573
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:11,479
I was being polite, okay?

574
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:14,684
Hey. What are you doing here?
I thought you were planning.

575
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,189
I never caught your name.

576
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:18,361
My name's Mavis.

577
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:21,111
Mavis? That's a
pretty neat name.

578
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,862
Yeah, my mom picked it.

579
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:26,115
So, are you going
to tell me your name?

580
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:30,199
Me? My name?
Good question.

581
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:32,205
Well, obviously,
I'm Frankenstein.

582
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,833
No, you're not. Frankenstein
is my uncle over there.

583
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,084
The gentleman hugging
Zombie Mozart.

584
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:40,584
Right. Of course,
he's your uncle.

585
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:43,804
Well, see, I'm not
"the" Frankenstein.

586
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:47,509
I'm his cousin, Johnnystein.

587
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:49,184
Johnnystein?
Hey, Mavis.

588
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:55,357
Who is that?

589
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:56,854
Are these monsters
going to kill me?

590
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:59,027
Not as long as they think
you're a monster.

591
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,524
Huh? That's kind of racist.

592
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:02,072
We'll talk later.

593
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,073
Is he making fun of me?
No, no.

594
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:10,281
Of course he's not,
because he's...

595
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,157
He's your cousin, Johnnystein.

596
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,867
Yes, yes, yes.

597
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,202
I don't have no cousin.

598
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:18,289
No, no, you do. He's your sixth
cousin, three times removed.

599
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,415
On your right arm's side.

600
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:21,671
You have a cousin?

601
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,047
Frank, if your arm could talk,

602
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:26,175
he would tell you that the original
owner of your arm had a brother.

603
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,551
Who married a woman.

604
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:29,725
Who was...
For strangling a pig.

605
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,268
I have pig-strangling
blood in my arm?

606
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:33,436
That's kind of cool.

607
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,435
Well, cuz, great to meet you.

608
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,109
So, what brings
you here, Johnny?

609
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:40,561
Wah! What was that?
Oh, sorry.

610
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:42,738
I should really clear my
throat before I speak.

611
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,610
Anyway, what brings you here?

612
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:45,906
Oh. Uh.

613
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,450
Party planner.

614
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:52,908
Yes, I have recruited Mr. Stein here to
help me with Mavis's birthday party.

615
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:55,959
Wait a minute, you asked
someone to help you?

616
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,251
Captain Control Freak?

617
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:58,419
It's Count...

618
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:02,545
And yes, I thought having a Mavis
contemporary would be useful.

619
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:05,969
Yeah, he totally needed
a fresher perspective.

620
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:08,673
Okay, Johnny, Mr. Tight
Coffin over here

621
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:11,471
was planning to have these powdered
lame-os play at the party.

622
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,263
So, anyways, we thought we
could liven things up a bit.

623
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:19,646
Whoa! You all play?
Let's check you guys out!

624
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:51,465
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, guys.

625
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:52,765
Stop.

626
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:54,468
That's cute, but
kind of old school.

627
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:56,394
Yes, thank you, Johnny.

628
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:59,097
You got to totally
tempo things up.

629
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,682
Here, let me show you.

630
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,689
Werewolf man, give me a jam!

631
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:04,815
Two, three, four!

632
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,125
118!
Say 118!

633
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,326
118!

634
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,583
Yeah! Stage dive!

635
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:27,633
Awesome.

636
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:29,336
I am so blown away right now.

637
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:32,889
I think my cuz
is gonna make this

638
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:36,013
the best party ever!

639
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:38,436
Yeah! Maybe he can find
a way to get me some chicks.

640
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,100
We should do a dance contest!

641
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,894
We're not doing any of that.

642
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,896
We've got to stay
on schedule, all right?

643
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,568
All right, Dad, all right.

644
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,112
Johnny, you're coming, too.
I don't know.

645
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,105
Is it cool with Dracula?
Johnny, come with us.

646
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,071
N-27.

647
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:12,461
G-61.

648
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:20,311
Bingo! Bingo!

649
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:21,479
How dare you.

650
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:23,477
Do you know what
doctor made me?

651
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:24,933
I didn't do that.

652
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:28,354
Circles?

653
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,063
Fly?

654
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:33,525
Hands?
Film.

655
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:35,989
Vomit.
The Vomit?

656
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:39,198
The Throw Up.
No. That wasn't a clue.

657
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:47,922
Nothing?

658
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,670
Emptiness?
Glasses?

659
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:52,340
Glasses?
Glasses shaking?

660
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,132
Glasses shaking sideways!

661
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,055
Through The Looking-Glass?

662
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:58,634
I stink at this.

663
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,961
I didn't do that.

664
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:35,091
And pull it back.
And up. And push.

665
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,548
And twist. And back.

666
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,849
And up. And twist.

667
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,221
And push.

668
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,560
No. Don't copy that.

669
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:49,859
And back. And up. And twist.

670
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,990
Let me get a bubonic
moose nose omelet

671
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:58,409
with cockroach paste
and mouse jelly.

672
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:00,203
And with egg whites.

673
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:03,744
Bonjour, Monsieur Dracula!

674
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,370
May I make you an omelet?

675
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,202
No, no, no, no.
I'm not hungry.

676
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:11,169
What? Esmeralda, you smell it again?

677
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,965
Human?
I am hungry.

678
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:16,837
Johnny, you've been
to the Taj Mahal?

679
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,389
Come on. No monster's
been to the Taj.

680
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,967
Man, I wish I could go there.

681
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,973
You know what?
I'll take 50 omelets.

682
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,846
You heard the man!
Make them!

683
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:30,479
How did you deal with the mobs?

684
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,811
Yeah, it does get pretty
crazy in the summer.

685
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:34,646
But, you know,
you just got to roll.

686
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:37,323
He just rolls. That's
cool that he rolls.

687
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,650
Yes, yes, cool.

688
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:43,113
Look, love droppings, I brought you a
bagel with your favorite, scream cheese.

689
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:44,698
Holy rabies.
Thanks, Dad.

690
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:46,704
Johnny, try some scream
cheese, it's awesome.

691
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:47,955
Oh, cool.

692
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:52,005
But I'm scream cheese
intolerant. So, polite pass.

693
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,582
Yes, of course you are.

694
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:57,044
Johnny, can we party-plan
talk for a minute?

695
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:58,298
What are you doing?

696
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:00,472
If they find out you are
human, they'll go bat poop!

697
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:02,720
Relax. No one
suspects anything.

698
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:05,643
The only thing that looks weird is
how much whispering you're doing.

699
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:10,982
Just wrap it up. You will say you are
going in the pool and act excited.

700
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:14,527
And then you will say you hurt
your back and you have to leave.

701
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,529
Here come good times! Whoo!

702
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,109
Oh, dudes. Oh, my back.

703
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,444
I'm on your back!

704
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,495
No, no. He said,
"Oh, my back."

705
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:26,824
Get on my back!
Let's do it.

706
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:30,035
Aw, here we go. Chicken fight!
Push them off!

707
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:32,416
Chicken fight!

708
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,546
We got you, Johnny.

709
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:35,999
You're going down.
Whoa.

710
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:39,256
Oh, yeah, we'll see,
"Mavey Wavey."

711
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:44,641
Okay, calm down
with the fight chickens!

712
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:47,139
Everyone, stop
the roughhousing!

713
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,515
Whoo!

714
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,894
Frank, if you hurt yourself...

715
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:57,479
I got it, honey.

716
00:39:57,562 --> 00:40:00,315
The Stein boys are bred
for this kind of thing.

717
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,820
Geronimo!

718
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,045
Eh-heh-heh.

719
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,997
Kids, Why'd you do that?

720
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,756
I was just in the pool.

721
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:18,924
The water's cold.

722
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,422
Don't judge me!

723
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:23,805
Johnny. Your makeup.

724
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,632
Your makeup!

725
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:26,967
Climb out. Now.

726
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:29,765
Oh, man.

727
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,472
I guess the Count wanted
to go for a swim.

728
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:47,988
Cannonball!

729
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,354
Oh, you messed up, baby.
You messed up big-time.

730
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,400
I told you to take it down.

731
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,353
You'll ruin my hotel
if they find out.

732
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,678
Well, maybe you're just jealous

733
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:23,440
that people are finally
having fun at this place.

734
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:26,117
Oh, that? That was not fun.

735
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:29,321
Everyone running, jumping,
swimming with no order.

736
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:30,826
That was the opposite of fun.

737
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,657
Do you even know what fun is?

738
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,117
I invented fun!

739
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,419
Boy, the wrong people
get to be immortal.

740
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,213
Look at me.

741
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:43,794
You remember nothing
of this encounter.

742
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:49,554
You have no memory of this
place or the monsters you met.

743
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:52,852
Now go and never return.

744
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:56,390
Wait, never return
to the hotel?

745
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,691
What? You were supposed
to forget the hotel.

746
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,985
I just used my powers
to erase your memory.

747
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,653
I looked straight
into your eyes.

748
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:04,652
Huh. Oh, maybe it's
the contact lenses.

749
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,820
The what? These little
plasticky doodads

750
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,033
that help me see better.

751
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:10,157
Here, let me just try
and get them out real quick.

752
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,955
Oh, that is the most disgusting
thing I've ever seen!

753
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:15,996
Almost got it. Stop doing that.
Please stop doing that!

754
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,669
Fingers away from
the eyeballs! Enough!

755
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:23,625
Listen to me. You are
never to return here.

756
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:27,588
You are to stay away and never
tell humans about this place.

757
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:32,221
Or I will track you down
and suck every ounce of blood

758
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,806
from your body until you look
like a deflated whoopee cushion!

759
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,808
Be gone.

760
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:49,446
Can't believe I'm leaving, man.
That could have been so great!

761
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:52,495
Dude ruined everything.
Suck my blood.

762
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,289
I should have just said,
"I'm staying, old man!"

763
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:58,459
Give him a Bruce Lee kick.
Boom! Right in the...

764
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:01,913
Oh, my God. Count Dracula. Please don't kill me.
I'm leaving, I'm leaving.

765
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:09,220
Follow me. Oh. No, no, Mavis, I can't.
I have to leave.

766
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,764
You sure? It'll be fun.
Okay.

767
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,526
He's not gonna see me, is he?

768
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:29,236
Whoa.

769
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:42,086
Wow, would you look at
the view from up here?

770
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:44,797
You could almost see Budapest.
Who-da-pest?

771
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,795
Is that near Ha-wi-fi?

772
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:50,674
Huh? Oh, you mean Hawaii. Yeah,
that place is a knockout.

773
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,755
I just went to a
music festival there.

774
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:54,716
A human music festival?

775
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:56,472
Uh, I believe so.

776
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:59,641
So, did they all bite your toes and
shove garlic bread in your face?

777
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,722
No. Well, one dude
took a bigger bite

778
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:03,395
out of my energy bar
than I expected,

779
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,896
but I blame that on the heat.

780
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:07,645
It's amazing.
You've been everywhere.

781
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,822
Well, you know,
what's the alternative?

782
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:13,492
Just staying at home, never exploring,
never seeing what's out there?

783
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:18,699
I'm only gonna be 121 once, right?
Got to live it.

784
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,247
Yeah.

785
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:27,917
Oh, man. The sunrise from
here must be amaz... Ow.

786
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,417
Oh, I'm sorry.

787
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:31,590
Man, you've probably never
even seen a sunrise, have you?

788
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,763
No, not really. Why?

789
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:35,260
Come on. I have an idea.

790
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:39,431
Watch.

791
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,453
Ahh.
Ahh.

792
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:10,463
Didn't I tell you guys we'd have fun in here?
Is this not the best?

793
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:16,423
Yeah, I'm working up
a nice sweat.

794
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:18,678
When's that Johnny kid gonna
be done party planning?

795
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,847
He's a great hang.
Yeah, he's an animal.

796
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:23,892
And it was so nice seeing Mavis
laughing and hitting it off with him.

797
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,599
Who's hitting
what off? Please.

798
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:30,107
Mavis could never be
with someone of his kind.

799
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:33,531
I'm sorry?
"His kind"?

800
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:35,901
You're saying our kind's
not good enough for you,

801
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,576
"Your Lordship"?

802
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:39,404
No, no, no!
Frank, I didn't...

803
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:44,414
I meant that she wouldn't be into
someone with such red, curly hair.

804
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:46,836
Uh, what's wrong
with red, curly hair?

805
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:48,205
Why are you getting upset?

806
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:50,206
I have red curly hair!

807
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:52,333
Well, how was I
supposed to know that?

808
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:10,819
This is the most incredible
thing I've ever seen.

809
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:14,321
Johnny?

810
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:15,740
Look, settle down, fellas.

811
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:18,905
This is all a moot point
because Johnny, he left.

812
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,243
Wait a minute. He left?

813
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:23,661
Yes. He decided he didn't
like Mavis, or any of us.

814
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,873
Hi.

815
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:29,555
Hmm. I guess Johnny
had second thoughts.

816
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:43,889
I can't believe you stuck around, man.
You don't get it.

817
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:46,183
Bad things are coming your way.

818
00:46:46,262 --> 00:46:49,266
I got to get my
thoughts together.

819
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:50,733
Okay.

820
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,227
You see these tables?

821
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:55,070
You can spend the entire
day pulling them out

822
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,189
and placing them,
party planner.

823
00:46:57,273 --> 00:46:59,241
Fantastic.
I'm trapped here.

824
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,452
Now I know how
your daughter feels.

825
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:11,663
Enough! Enough! Stop!

826
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:13,339
Go to a corner,
you're in a timeout!

827
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:15,416
Timeout? I'm a grown man!

828
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:16,588
Ahh!

829
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:25,769
Okay. Table 57, please
move to position 23.

830
00:47:25,885 --> 00:47:26,932
Whoa.

831
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:32,187
- That is cool.
- Face the wall.

832
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:37,113
17 to 48. 16 to 47. 19 to 50.

833
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,029
Awesomeness.
Just let me do my work.

834
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,826
29 to 35.

835
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:44,945
42 to 18. 10 to 44.

836
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:46,948
17, 18, 19, 20,
21, 22, 23.

837
00:47:47,073 --> 00:47:48,495
39 to 24.

838
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:49,959
36 up!

839
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:51,578
29 to 35.

840
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,591
Whoa!

841
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:01,963
31 to 19.

842
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,054
24 up!

843
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:12,811
Seven to 25. 14 to 30.

844
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:22,233
Where'd you go, grandpa?

845
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,239
Don't freak out, gravity face.

846
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:26,495
Eat my dust, gray fangs!

847
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:28,697
56 and 43, to my side.

848
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,160
Whoo!

849
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:43,012
Prepare to cry, Billy Backpack.

850
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:48,517
That's how we do it!
Half-pipe, baby!

851
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:50,511
Whatever.

852
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,640
Yes. Keep smelling.

853
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:59,820
You catch the human, and then
I will make human potpie!

854
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:05,910
27, 45, 65, 76,
48, block his path.

855
00:49:06,235 --> 00:49:07,452
Block his path!

856
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:13,375
Whoa-ho!

857
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,713
Oh, come on now, dude man!

858
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,336
Nice!

859
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:24,258
Haha! Whoa-ho-ho!

860
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,387
I got you, buddy.

861
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:33,513
Do not disturb!

862
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:34,939
People trying to sleep here!

863
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,365
Did you see that?

864
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:51,994
Who is that guy,
Sir Breaks-a-lot?

865
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:58,421
Oh, boy, I have to say,
that was fun. Okay?

866
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:02,842
The fun you were talking
about earlier? Nailed it!

867
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:05,336
Johnny?

868
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,632
Quasimodo!

869
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:22,900
Mavis? Why are you still up? The sun is out.
It could kill you, my honeyguts.

870
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:25,197
I couldn't sleep. Do you
know where Johnny went?

871
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,694
I don't know. He...

872
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:28,902
Why do you want to know?
Oh! Uh...

873
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:30,952
Do you like him?
What?

874
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:34,248
Pfft, no. Come on, Dad.
He's so weird and awkward.

875
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:37,668
It's like, are you an idiot or
do you know you're adorable?

876
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,664
Eh... Hold that.

877
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:44,501
Do you have a location on Quasimodo?
Yes, sir.

878
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:46,218
They're heading through the
lobby, towards the kitchen.

879
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:47,636
I need them
stopped immediately.

880
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,384
Is that clear?
Yes, quite.

881
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:50,965
We are on it.

882
00:50:57,846 --> 00:50:58,893
Ha-ha! Missed!

883
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:04,483
What is the meaning of
this? Let me pass!

884
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:07,031
Quasimodo Wilson,
you are coming with us.

885
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:11,152
Why did that hurt me?

886
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:18,034
Look, honey, there's no
falling in love at your age.

887
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:20,752
Mom was my age. Eunice
says Mom kissed you first

888
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:22,830
'cause you were too scared
to make the first move.

889
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,415
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

890
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,717
Forget about me
and Mom and kissing.

891
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:29,633
Dad, at some point,
I'm going to get married.

892
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:32,135
I can't be here forever.
What? Why not?

893
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:35,218
You're barely out of
your training fangs.

894
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:08,550
Ha-ha!

895
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:10,344
Quasi wins again!

896
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:14,094
When you bump with the hump,
you land on your rump!

897
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:23,183
But why all the
sudden interest?

898
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:26,018
Every time we used to talk
about love, it was always,

899
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:27,944
"Ooh, Dad, that's gross,"

900
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:30,781
and "Ooh, Dad, I don't want
to know about that."

901
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:32,150
I don't know.

902
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:34,944
Sir, he made it into the kitchen.
He what?

903
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:36,412
What do I pay you for?

904
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:38,581
I'm sorry, honey.
I have to go.

905
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:41,917
He doesn't pay me.

906
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:47,418
Before you kill me,

907
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:50,126
can I please talk to my
backpack one more time?

908
00:52:50,209 --> 00:52:52,507
I don't want to leave
anything unresolved.

909
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,805
Bonjour, Monsieur Dracula!

910
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,302
Shut your hump hole.

911
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:57,804
Now you are helping him?

912
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:59,931
What is it with you
and this human?

913
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,308
He is not human.
He's a Stein!

914
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:04,607
That's right, little man,
I'm a Stein!

915
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:08,607
If he is a monster,
let him scare Esmeralda!

916
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:10,229
The mouse?

917
00:53:10,479 --> 00:53:12,356
Pfft! Without a doubt.

918
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:14,650
Okay. Here we go.

919
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:17,111
Blargh!

920
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:18,821
Bleegh!

921
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:20,781
Blargy-bliggy-blargh!

922
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:28,923
A human! A human!

923
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:33,673
Monsieur Dracula has brought
a human into the...

924
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:40,142
Esmeralda, help me.

925
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:53,773
Hey, thanks for saving
me back there.

926
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:56,575
That guy's crazy!
Trying to eat me.

927
00:53:56,650 --> 00:54:00,621
That's only happened to me one other time.
This weird dude at a Slipknot concert.

928
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:03,245
There's something
I need to show you.

929
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:14,885
Wow.

930
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,054
Hey, are we at
a funeral right now?

931
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:19,678
Oh, wait, no, it's your bed.

932
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:23,181
So creepy and cool.

933
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,228
Wow! I know her!

934
00:54:25,304 --> 00:54:29,480
I've seen that picture at the ruins of Lubov.
That's my favorite castle.

935
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:31,481
There's a whole legend
around that lady.

936
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,652
A legend?

937
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:35,739
The Lady Lubov.

938
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:38,492
The story is that
a lonely count

939
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:41,662
met her by chance, and
they say that no two souls

940
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:43,831
were ever more meant
for each other.

941
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:47,752
Eventually, they settled down at
Castle Lubov and had a child.

942
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:51,456
But then, a horrible
tragedy happened.

943
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:56,089
A fire started mysteriously one
night, and it killed both of them.

944
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:03,434
When I was at the castle, I could
still feel their powerful love.

945
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:08,060
They say it's as if a soul is still
trapped in the ruins themselves.

946
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:11,520
The legend is wrong.

947
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:17,072
It was only the wife that died.

948
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:25,076
Oh.

949
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:29,411
And it was no mystery
who killed her.

950
00:55:30,619 --> 00:55:33,213
She was killed by your kind!

951
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:36,216
Vampire!

952
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,716
Honey? Go hide. I'll
take care of this.

953
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,636
Vampire!

954
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:48,929
Martha!

955
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:53,476
They are the real monsters.

956
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:07,199
I built this place for my
love, to protect her child.

957
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:11,206
As a father, you do everything
to keep your family safe,

958
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:15,040
even if you have
to break their trust.

959
00:56:15,122 --> 00:56:19,753
But now, Mavis has
feelings for you.

960
00:56:19,835 --> 00:56:20,927
What?

961
00:56:21,003 --> 00:56:23,051
I just...

962
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,263
Awesome.
It's all right.

963
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,094
You are a good one.

964
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:31,851
If the world was different,
maybe it would be possible.

965
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:34,266
Drac, this is the 21st century.

966
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:36,477
People aren't the same
as they were back then.

967
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,939
Can you tell me for certain that
if we came out in the open,

968
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:41,444
everyone would accept us?

969
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:42,649
Everyone?

970
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:48,247
No. You're right.

971
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:50,908
I'll go for good this time.

972
00:56:50,991 --> 00:56:53,289
You can just say
I had some emergency,

973
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:55,962
or the gremlin lady
ate me or something.

974
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:57,506
No, no, no, no, no.

975
00:56:57,581 --> 00:57:00,380
I don't want to ruin
her birthday party.

976
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:03,679
You can sneak out
after it's all done.

977
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:06,132
I'm sorry.

978
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:09,559
The last thing I wanted
was to hurt her.

979
00:57:09,635 --> 00:57:10,807
Or you.

980
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:15,774
You know, you're not
the smoothest Frankenstein,

981
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,352
but you'd make a great vampire.

982
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:19,527
For real?

983
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:21,355
'Cause I think I kind of got
your hypno-eyes down.

984
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:24,066
Oh, boy, here we go.
Let me see it.

985
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:27,528
Beware! For you
are in my power.

986
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:30,239
I command you to
be the werewolf man!

987
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,996
I have too many kids.

988
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:38,331
Someone scratch
me, I have fleas.

989
00:57:39,915 --> 00:57:41,508
'Cause he's a wolf,
he'd get those.

990
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:43,130
Yeah, no, don't explain it.

991
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:44,837
It's not funny
when you do that.

992
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:07,818
I didn't order
a wake-up call.

993
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:10,950
Count Dracula
arranged it for all the rooms.

994
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:14,245
Where's the snooze button?

995
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,543
There will be no snoozing.
The party's today.

996
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:40,605
Ooh, yeah, perfecto.

997
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:22,309
Wow.

998
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,611
You look beautiful.

999
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:26,939
Thanks. Thanks
for the party.

1000
00:59:27,022 --> 00:59:29,024
Yeah, you like
my little touches?

1001
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,590
It's amazing.

1002
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:04,188
Terrific party. You really
outdid yourself, Drac.

1003
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:06,941
Got to be the best one
I've been to in 500 years.

1004
01:00:16,905 --> 01:00:19,249
Sorry, big man.

1005
01:00:39,511 --> 01:00:41,104
Uh, Mavis?

1006
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:43,056
I'm crazily scared right now.

1007
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:45,518
Maybe that's a good thing.

1008
01:00:57,696 --> 01:01:00,996
How could you? After I
shared my pain with you?

1009
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:02,747
But, no...
Dad, it was just a kiss.

1010
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:04,419
No, you're not allowed to kiss.

1011
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:07,919
Dad, I'm allowed to do things.
I'm not 83 any more.

1012
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:10,217
I'm allowed to like people,
or go see the world again.

1013
01:01:10,292 --> 01:01:12,920
What? You saw it! You
said you didn't like it!

1014
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:14,883
Maybe I want to give
the village another chance.

1015
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:17,925
I just need to learn, you know, just
how to roll with it, like Johnny does.

1016
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:20,932
No, no, you can't go
to the village again.

1017
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:22,479
Maybe you can make them see
that we could be friends.

1018
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:24,056
No, that isn't possible.

1019
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:26,358
Well, you can't be sure. It's all
in how you present yourself.

1020
01:01:26,433 --> 01:01:28,310
No, that won't make a difference!
How do you know?

1021
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:29,736
Because it just won't!
Why? Why won't it?

1022
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:32,314
Because that village
doesn't really exist!

1023
01:01:37,152 --> 01:01:39,905
What do you mean
"doesn't exist"?

1024
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:41,831
What did you do?

1025
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:44,251
I did what I had to do.

1026
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:45,452
What was it?

1027
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:49,165
What exactly did you
have to do? Tell me!

1028
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:56,305
I... I built the town. The
staff put it all together.

1029
01:01:56,379 --> 01:02:00,509
The zombies dressed up
as the townspeople.

1030
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:04,479
Please. I...

1031
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:07,808
If you really went out there
and something happened to you,

1032
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:10,485
I just couldn't
live with myself.

1033
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:14,736
But you can live with this?
Lying to me? Tricking me?

1034
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:17,988
Keeping me here forever when
you knew my dream was to go.

1035
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:21,700
Liar! Liar!

1036
01:02:22,489 --> 01:02:23,741
Oil?

1037
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:25,746
Uh-uh-uh!

1038
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:28,749
English, please.

1039
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:30,876
Your voice is really annoying.

1040
01:02:30,956 --> 01:02:32,503
Wait, I speak frozen.

1041
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:36,086
He says, "Dracula has brought
a human into the hotel."

1042
01:02:37,629 --> 01:02:39,677
A human?
Stay close, pookie!

1043
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:44,432
He says,
"There is ze human."

1044
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:46,058
He has a French accent.

1045
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:54,271
Johnny's not a human.
He's my right arm's cousin.

1046
01:02:54,354 --> 01:02:56,448
- He's lying.
- Yeah.

1047
01:02:56,523 --> 01:02:57,775
And why is he picking his nose?

1048
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:01,862
He says, "it's a long story."

1049
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:04,289
Hey, wait, no! Get off me!

1050
01:03:04,364 --> 01:03:05,411
Ew!

1051
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:10,287
He says, "Behold ze human."

1052
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,291
I don't believe it.

1053
01:03:20,714 --> 01:03:23,809
Is it true?
Are you a human?

1054
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,970
Yes.

1055
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:29,438
I'm so sorry.

1056
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:34,190
I don't care. I still
want to be with you.

1057
01:03:42,444 --> 01:03:43,491
Uh...

1058
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:48,333
Well, tough. 'Cause I don't
want to be with you.

1059
01:03:48,408 --> 01:03:51,912
Because you're a monster.
And I hate monsters.

1060
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,548
Goodbye.

1061
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:58,543
Please don't hurt me!

1062
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:04,141
This is all your fault!

1063
01:04:06,051 --> 01:04:08,804
We're getting out of here.
I'm never coming back here.

1064
01:04:08,887 --> 01:04:12,733
I thought I smelt a human.
"Human-free"? What a rip.

1065
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:27,197
Oh. Here he comes.
Count Crock-ula.

1066
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:31,581
I'm just glad my eyes are stitched
shut, 'cause I don't even want to...

1067
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:36,794
Mavis, honey, are you in there?

1068
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,594
Mavis? Mavis?

1069
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:45,594
Mavis, where are you?

1070
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:47,516
Mavis?

1071
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:10,165
Dad, can you do me a favor?

1072
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:13,665
Yes, yes, of course,
darling. Anything.

1073
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:15,461
Will you erase my mind?

1074
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:20,967
No, no, no, no.
No, I won't do that.

1075
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:23,921
There's too much
I want you to remember.

1076
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:27,758
You were right, Dad.
The humans hate us.

1077
01:05:27,841 --> 01:05:31,641
Sweetheart, there are so many
eligible monsters out there.

1078
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:33,062
You're so young to...

1079
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:36,645
What is it? What
are you reading?

1080
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,443
"Two lonely bats
crashed in the night."

1081
01:05:48,153 --> 01:05:52,579
"They felt a Zing.
Love at first sight."

1082
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:57,037
"They knew right then they
would be husband and wife."

1083
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:02,293
"For a Zing only happens
once in your life."

1084
01:06:02,834 --> 01:06:05,007
"Your Zing will come, my love."

1085
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:06,508
"Cherish it."

1086
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:09,011
"Love, Mommy."

1087
01:06:12,594 --> 01:06:16,690
- I thought we Zinged, Dad.
- You and Johnny?

1088
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:19,483
I guess it was only me.

1089
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:21,607
But you should be happy, Dad.

1090
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:23,609
There's no reason
for me to leave.

1091
01:06:23,688 --> 01:06:28,159
I have no more dreams.
I'm just like you now.

1092
01:06:54,469 --> 01:06:57,598
Martha, what have I done?

1093
01:07:04,145 --> 01:07:05,772
Where is my bill?
Over here. I'm next.

1094
01:07:05,897 --> 01:07:08,867
I'm checking out. Take my key!
Take my key!

1095
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:11,323
What is this minibar charge?

1096
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:13,530
Honey, the kids threw
the minibar out the window.

1097
01:07:13,613 --> 01:07:15,707
And that's our fault?
Well...

1098
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:18,376
Excuse me!
Pardon, yeah.

1099
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:21,830
Excuse me, I got a couple
of people to express mail.

1100
01:07:23,248 --> 01:07:25,125
Friends, please, stop.

1101
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:27,336
It's too late, rat-bat!

1102
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:28,886
Please, I'm begging you.

1103
01:07:28,962 --> 01:07:31,715
I need you to help
me find Johnny.

1104
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:33,846
The human? He
could've killed us!

1105
01:07:33,925 --> 01:07:35,723
He touched my guitar!

1106
01:07:35,802 --> 01:07:39,978
He put his hand in my mouth
to see if it would disappear.

1107
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:43,526
He let me eat his scooter!

1108
01:07:44,936 --> 01:07:47,280
I know I lied.

1109
01:07:47,355 --> 01:07:48,948
I was wrong.

1110
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:50,946
But you have to believe this:

1111
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:54,700
Johnny wasn't a bad guy.

1112
01:07:55,697 --> 01:07:59,952
The truth is, I don't even know
if humans are bad any more.

1113
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:06,337
Frank, come on, buddy.
You understand.

1114
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:07,918
He's not talking to you.

1115
01:08:08,001 --> 01:08:10,379
First you tell us humans
are bad, now they're good.

1116
01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:13,465
What else? Up is down, cold
is hot, gremlins don't smell.

1117
01:08:13,548 --> 01:08:15,550
Hey!

1118
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:21,181
I really liked Johnny, cousin or no.
He told fun stories.

1119
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:23,312
I think they Zinged.

1120
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:24,688
They Zinged?

1121
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:26,940
But I got in the way.

1122
01:08:27,604 --> 01:08:30,483
You only Zing
once in your life.

1123
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:34,486
Oy, now you're short-circuiting.
I don't care!

1124
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:37,288
Well, what are we doing?
Let's get Johnny. Come on!

1125
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:39,582
Yeah, let's do it!
Come on!

1126
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:44,208
Yeah!

1127
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:48,504
We should have
honeymooned at your parents!

1128
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:01,805
Okay, okay, where am I going?

1129
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:04,983
The human world, before
Johnny's gone forever.

1130
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:06,184
But what about the sun?

1131
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:10,279
I don't know. I'll
just have to roll.

1132
01:09:10,355 --> 01:09:12,232
He just rolls.
Rollability.

1133
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:14,629
So we follow
his boot-prints.

1134
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:17,074
When they run out, that's
where you come in, Wayne.

1135
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:18,325
Me?
There!

1136
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:24,418
Yes, I knew something would
fall out of that backpack.

1137
01:09:25,703 --> 01:09:28,047
Yowch! That stinks!

1138
01:09:28,122 --> 01:09:29,374
Work your magic.

1139
01:09:29,457 --> 01:09:31,551
Wait, you want me
to track the smell?

1140
01:09:31,626 --> 01:09:33,970
No. My sniffing tracking
days are way behind me.

1141
01:09:34,087 --> 01:09:35,964
Do you know how many
diapers I've changed?

1142
01:09:36,047 --> 01:09:38,641
How many number twos
have destroyed this thing?

1143
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:40,263
But...

1144
01:09:53,648 --> 01:09:55,867
Hey! Take it easy!
Watch it!

1145
01:09:56,901 --> 01:09:58,403
Sit.

1146
01:09:59,278 --> 01:10:01,531
Smell. I said smell.

1147
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:06,627
Not me, the shirt!
The shirt!

1148
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:09,456
Do any of your kids
still respect you?

1149
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:12,258
Mm, give me
a second. Oh, yeah.

1150
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:15,428
Winnie! Front and center!

1151
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:27,891
He got into a car.
A '86 Fiat.

1152
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:32,229
It needs a little transmission
work, but otherwise okay.

1153
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:37,408
It drove through town to the airport.
Flight 497.

1154
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:38,951
8:00 a.m. departure.

1155
01:10:39,026 --> 01:10:40,869
That's in 15 minutes.

1156
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:42,572
Seat 23A.

1157
01:10:43,197 --> 01:10:44,824
He ordered the vegetarian meal.

1158
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:47,285
Okay, thank you, cutie.

1159
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:49,458
Now, all of you,
go back to your mother!

1160
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,046
Sheep!

1161
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:11,560
High five! Don't
leave me hanging.

1162
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:14,687
Lots of sheep!
I got this one.

1163
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:24,914
What? Now there's no sheep in the road.
Let's go.

1164
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:26,582
That was pretty sick, man.

1165
01:11:26,657 --> 01:11:29,035
You eat lamb chops,
it's the same thing.

1166
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:31,158
We don't have time for this.
Come on, let's move it!

1167
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:37,210
Look, a human.

1168
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:43,634
Welcome to Transylvania!

1169
01:11:46,219 --> 01:11:48,768
That was trippy.

1170
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:50,435
Monster Festival?

1171
01:11:51,182 --> 01:11:52,399
What's a Monster Festival?

1172
01:11:59,065 --> 01:12:01,318
Did they know we were coming?

1173
01:12:24,298 --> 01:12:25,891
They like us?

1174
01:12:25,967 --> 01:12:27,469
Really?

1175
01:12:28,886 --> 01:12:31,435
Excuse me? Do you know the
best way to the airport?

1176
01:12:31,556 --> 01:12:35,311
Yes, fellow Dracula. There's only one way.
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

1177
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:39,026
But it's all blocked.
We'll never make it in time.

1178
01:12:39,105 --> 01:12:41,858
You should have left an hour earlier.
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

1179
01:12:41,941 --> 01:12:44,615
I do not say
"Bleh, bleh-bleh."

1180
01:12:45,236 --> 01:12:48,080
All right, let's just run
through it on foot.

1181
01:12:53,995 --> 01:12:56,123
Drac, this'll protect you.

1182
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:57,627
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

1183
01:12:57,748 --> 01:13:00,467
Imagine if that guy knew he
was talking to the real Drac.

1184
01:13:00,585 --> 01:13:02,258
He'd run for the hills!

1185
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:04,589
Hold it, now. Hold it, now.

1186
01:13:04,672 --> 01:13:06,219
That sounds spot on.

1187
01:13:06,299 --> 01:13:10,475
But the only way they'd know the
real us is if we show the real us.

1188
01:13:10,595 --> 01:13:11,767
This could work.

1189
01:13:11,846 --> 01:13:14,565
You mean, like, scare them? We
haven't scared people in centuries.

1190
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,893
I don't even think
I have it in me any more.

1191
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:21,614
I got nothing.
I really got nothing.

1192
01:13:21,689 --> 01:13:23,316
Let's just move this along.

1193
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:32,875
Fire! Fire!

1194
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:34,335
Fire!

1195
01:13:47,798 --> 01:13:50,551
I'm trying to scare you!

1196
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:52,394
The real Frankenstein!

1197
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:54,479
We know! We love you!

1198
01:13:54,555 --> 01:13:56,023
Can you sign my torch?

1199
01:13:57,642 --> 01:14:03,615
Listen, before anything else,
down there's the real Dracula!

1200
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:05,191
Prove it.

1201
01:14:06,192 --> 01:14:07,489
All right. Continue.

1202
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:11,414
Drac's daughter's in love, and
he's got to get to the airport!

1203
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:13,703
And he can't get
through this crowd!

1204
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:17,374
Why doesn't he fly? The sun, you idiot.
He's a vampire.

1205
01:14:17,495 --> 01:14:20,123
That's right. Thank you,
Monster Nerd.

1206
01:14:20,206 --> 01:14:25,087
So, people, if you really are our
friends, clear a path for the man!

1207
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:29,216
Okay. All Draculas,
line up. Bleh, bleh-bleh.

1208
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:37,356
Everyone else, lift the capes.
Protect our friend. Bleh, bleh-bleh.

1209
01:14:45,356 --> 01:14:47,233
It's all for you, buddy.

1210
01:14:48,526 --> 01:14:50,153
Go ahead.

1211
01:14:50,236 --> 01:14:51,488
Good luck!
Go get 'em!

1212
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:52,617
Go, Drac, go!

1213
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:54,581
Go, Drac!
Go, Drac!

1214
01:14:54,657 --> 01:14:56,204
Go, Drac!

1215
01:14:58,244 --> 01:15:00,042
Go, Drac!

1216
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:04,338
Go, Drac!

1217
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:06,135
Go get 'em!

1218
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:09,338
Go, Drac, go!

1219
01:15:09,422 --> 01:15:12,801
We love you, Dracula!

1220
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:28,820
There's no choice.

1221
01:16:07,021 --> 01:16:08,648
Ouch. Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1222
01:16:08,731 --> 01:16:10,825
Okay. Okay, I must do this.

1223
01:16:29,126 --> 01:16:32,676
Jonathan. Jonathan,
can you hear me?

1224
01:16:32,755 --> 01:16:35,804
Tell me, do you dream
of being a vampire?

1225
01:16:35,883 --> 01:16:38,932
This is how we're represented.
Unbelievable.

1226
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:41,105
Jonathan. Jonathan.

1227
01:16:41,806 --> 01:16:43,103
Can you hear me?

1228
01:16:43,182 --> 01:16:44,684
Whoa! Bat!

1229
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:47,611
Wait, it's talking.
Dracula? Is that you?

1230
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:50,402
Huh? Dracula.

1231
01:16:50,481 --> 01:16:53,030
I can't understand you.

1232
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:56,113
What? My hand's
in a tan shoe?

1233
01:16:56,195 --> 01:17:00,291
What? Japan's
eating lamb stew?

1234
01:17:00,366 --> 01:17:02,368
Hey, do you know
you're smoking?

1235
01:17:08,207 --> 01:17:09,299
Oh.

1236
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:10,627
Pardon me. Sorry, excuse me.

1237
01:17:10,709 --> 01:17:12,382
Whoa! Excuse me.

1238
01:17:26,851 --> 01:17:29,229
What the heck? How'd a
bat get up this high?

1239
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:34,196
Folks, I'm gonna turn on the seat belt sign.
Just a precaution while we...

1240
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:41,624
While we hear a special announcement
for my dear friend Jonathan.

1241
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:42,871
Dracula?

1242
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:47,330
My dear boy, I have
made a terrible mistake.

1243
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:51,043
I was trying to keep
my baby to myself,

1244
01:17:51,125 --> 01:17:53,799
because I knew I would
always protect her.

1245
01:17:53,878 --> 01:17:59,476
But I realize now, children need
to discover things for themselves.

1246
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:03,475
They'll stumble and fall,
laugh and cry,

1247
01:18:03,554 --> 01:18:05,352
but such is life.

1248
01:18:05,431 --> 01:18:08,810
The truth is, you and
Mavis are meant to be.

1249
01:18:08,893 --> 01:18:10,361
You Zinged.

1250
01:18:10,436 --> 01:18:13,360
If she must give her
trust to someone else,

1251
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:16,534
I'm thankful that it
is you, Jonathan.

1252
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:20,955
I hope you can hear me
and forgive me-

1253
01:18:34,793 --> 01:18:39,424
Okay, folks, we're going to make
a quick turnaround to refuel,

1254
01:18:39,506 --> 01:18:41,725
and then we'll be
back on our way.

1255
01:18:42,843 --> 01:18:45,687
Quit your whining!
I'm burning up out here!

1256
01:18:59,068 --> 01:19:00,160
Dad?

1257
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:06,455
I'm fine. I'm just
a little sunburnt.

1258
01:19:08,911 --> 01:19:10,083
Honey,

1259
01:19:11,664 --> 01:19:15,760
I always thought the worst thing
ever would be seeing you go.

1260
01:19:15,834 --> 01:19:19,338
But the worst is
seeing you unhappy.

1261
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:22,470
Mavey, I want you
to live your life.

1262
01:19:24,677 --> 01:19:26,771
I don't know how
I'm supposed to do that.

1263
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:31,730
You know, Mommy already
gave you her birthday present.

1264
01:19:31,809 --> 01:19:33,811
Can I now give you mine?

1265
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:37,690
What do I need this for?

1266
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:40,242
Oh, it comes with an accessory.

1267
01:19:42,152 --> 01:19:44,655
You?
You.

1268
01:19:45,406 --> 01:19:46,828
Why are you back?

1269
01:19:50,744 --> 01:19:52,667
'Cause you're my Zing, Mavis.

1270
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:54,756
I'm your Zing?

1271
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:57,676
But you told me
you hate monsters.

1272
01:19:57,751 --> 01:20:00,675
Yeah, well, I was afraid
your dad was gonna

1273
01:20:00,754 --> 01:20:03,052
suck all the blood out of my
body if I didn't say that.

1274
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:04,850
I wouldn't have...

1275
01:20:04,925 --> 01:20:06,802
No, he's right,
I would have done that.

1276
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:09,934
Dad.
I was wrong, Devil-chops.

1277
01:20:13,559 --> 01:20:15,653
Do you really mean it, Dad?

1278
01:20:17,104 --> 01:20:19,357
Go make your own paradise.

1279
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:25,488
Can we try that
kiss over again?

1280
01:20:25,571 --> 01:20:28,199
I think we can.

1281
01:20:32,244 --> 01:20:35,874
Sorry. I just...
I got to get used to that.

1282
01:20:35,956 --> 01:20:38,584
Go. Do your thing.

1283
01:20:48,969 --> 01:20:50,516
Stop! Stop!

1284
01:21:32,346 --> 01:21:34,144
Drac, you ready to throw down?

1285
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:37,397
No, no, I just came closer
to hear you better.

1286
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:39,353
Come on, just give it a try.

1287
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:41,446
All right, maybe just a little.

1288
01:22:48,005 --> 01:22:50,007
Housekeeping!

1289
01:25:46,683 --> 01:25:48,685
I didn't do that.

1289
01:25:49,305 --> 01:25:55,205
