<i>This land has a name today</i>
<i>and is marked on maps. </i>

3
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:16,171
<i>But the names and the marks and the land</i>
<i>all had to be won. </i>

4
00:08:16,846 --> 00:08:19,508
<i>Won from nature and from primitive man. </i>

5
00:08:21,117 --> 00:08:25,486
<i>Five generations ago,</i>
<i>a mere 125 years back... </i>

6
00:08:26,822 --> 00:08:29,120
<i>... this land was known only as the West... </i>

7
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,686
<i>... known only to a handful of white men... </i>

8
00:08:33,563 --> 00:08:37,693
<i>... lonely trappers wandering its vastness</i>
<i>in search of beaver. </i>

9
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:41,698
<i>They were known as "mountain men",</i>
<i>a new breed. </i>

10
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:46,071
<i>Men like Jim Bridger, Linus Rawlings... </i>

11
00:08:46,842 --> 00:08:49,811
<i>... more Indian than the Indians</i>
<i>in all but blood. </i>

12
00:08:50,413 --> 00:08:52,881
<i>They held to no law but their own... </i>

13
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:58,577
<i>... drifted free as the clouds,</i>
<i>settled nowhere, kept forever on the move. </i>

14
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:03,850
<i>Their mocassined feet and unshod horses</i>
<i>left no trace on the land. </i>

15
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:09,259
<i>Like the Indians,</i>
<i>with whom they were at peace... </i>

16
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:13,091
<i>... they wanted nothing</i>
<i>beyond what they found and little of that. </i>

17
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:18,368
<i>The mountains, the forests,</i>
<i>the harsh country... </i>

18
00:09:18,941 --> 00:09:21,842
<i>... were as unchanging to them</i>
<i>as the stars... </i>

19
00:09:22,545 --> 00:09:24,308
<i>... and just as unyielding. </i>

20
00:09:26,849 --> 00:09:30,410
<i>Far behind the mountains,</i>
<i>beyond the rolling plains... </i>

21
00:09:31,187 --> 00:09:33,553
<i>... they had left the people of the East... </i>

22
00:09:33,956 --> 00:09:36,789
<i>... people who were restless in another way. </i>

23
00:09:37,393 --> 00:09:40,362
<i>The kind who would look at the mountain</i>
<i>and see a watershed... </i>

24
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:42,997
<i>... look at the forest</i>
<i>and see lumber for houses... </i>

25
00:09:43,065 --> 00:09:45,761
<i>... look at a stony field and see a farm. </i>

26
00:09:46,636 --> 00:09:49,867
<i>Their faces and their instincts</i>
<i>had been turned to the West... </i>

27
00:09:50,606 --> 00:09:53,097
<i>... ever since Plymouth Rock</i>
<i>and James Town. </i>

28
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:57,606
<i>The trapper"s road was the trade</i>
<i>of the wolf or the bend of the canyon. </i>

29
00:09:58,147 --> 00:10:03,244
<i>But for whole families following the sun,</i>
<i>there had to be broader ways. </i>

30
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,081
<i>There were no roads into the woodlands,</i>
<i>only rivers... </i>

31
00:10:09,258 --> 00:10:12,352
<i>... and they flowed in the wrong direction,</i>
<i>north or south. </i>

32
00:10:12,461 --> 00:10:15,123
<i>Or else they stopped at the Alleghanys. </i>

33
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,397
<i>Until one day... </i>

34
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:22,132
<i>... a new river took source in the mind</i>
<i>of a man named DeWitt Clinton. </i>

35
00:10:22,972 --> 00:10:25,634
<i>He conceived of a river that would go west. </i>

36
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:30,837
<i>And in the way Americans have</i>
<i>of acting out their dreams, it came to be. </i>

37
00:10:31,814 --> 00:10:34,544
<i>The Erie Canal left the Hudson</i>
<i>above Albany... </i>

38
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,141
<i>... and carried clear across</i>
<i>to the Great Lakes. </i>

39
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:41,652
<i>People who yearned for virgin land</i>
<i>and the new life... </i>

40
00:10:41,924 --> 00:10:45,451
<i>... now had a highway to take them. </i>
<i>And they moved along. </i>

41
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,360
Pride of Utica now loading.

42
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:52,292
All aboard for the Pride of Utica.

43
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:56,500
The Ramsey family, Peter Smith...

44
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,132
...the Skoga family...

45
00:10:59,542 --> 00:11:01,237
...all eight of 'em.

46
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:04,976
All aboard for the Pride of Utica.

47
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,619
Is the laddie's health
the reason you're heading west?

48
00:11:10,686 --> 00:11:11,812
Partly.

49
00:11:11,887 --> 00:11:14,788
Only partly.
Mostly our trouble East was rocks.

50
00:11:15,191 --> 00:11:18,592
I had me a farm where some years
I'd raise 100 bushels of rocks a year.

51
00:11:18,661 --> 00:11:21,186
Zebulon, you hadn't oughta lie
to the man like that.

52
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:24,596
Wife, I'm a God-fearing soul,
and I tell the truth as I see it.

53
00:11:25,334 --> 00:11:28,770
I never used a plow.
I'd blast out the furrows with gunpowder.

54
00:11:28,838 --> 00:11:30,135
Then one mornin'...

55
00:11:30,206 --> 00:11:32,140
...I hauled the bucket up
out of the well and...

56
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,870
...so help me, the bucket was full of rocks.

57
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:35,933
Rocks.

58
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:39,308
I just stood there right still
trying not to blaspheme...

59
00:11:39,515 --> 00:11:41,949
...and said to myself:
"You've got a son that's ailin'.

60
00:11:42,017 --> 00:11:44,485
"You've got a 20-year-old daughter
who won't take a husband. "

61
00:11:44,553 --> 00:11:46,316
There she sits, moonin' as usual.

62
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:47,151
Pa.

63
00:11:47,223 --> 00:11:50,215
"You've got another daughter,
just don't seem quite right in the head. "

64
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,281
Lilith.

65
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:55,121
Yes, Pa?

66
00:11:57,066 --> 00:11:58,431
I remind you, sir.

67
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,366
I'm still standing there
holding a bucket full of rocks...

68
00:12:03,172 --> 00:12:05,834
...and staring into a bleak old age.

69
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,708
So I made me a vow
right then and there. I said:

70
00:12:08,778 --> 00:12:12,145
"If I can find a man with $500
who likes rocks...

71
00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:16,116
"... then there's gonna be another fool
ownin' this farm. "

72
00:12:16,185 --> 00:12:18,915
Well, sir, the Lord provided such a man...

73
00:12:19,855 --> 00:12:21,254
...and here I am.

74
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:24,223
He ain't told you one word of truth,
Mr. Harvey.

75
00:12:24,393 --> 00:12:26,122
We had the best farm in the township.

76
00:12:26,195 --> 00:12:28,527
Yeah, Rockville Township it was.
Stone County.

77
00:12:28,597 --> 00:12:29,928
Oh, it was not.

78
00:12:30,366 --> 00:12:32,891
It was his itchin' foot that brought us here.

79
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:35,499
Heaven knows where we'll end up.

80
00:12:36,272 --> 00:12:39,901
Oh, these are my laddies.
Angus, Brutus and Colin.

81
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,476
- How do you do?
- Hello.

82
00:12:41,544 --> 00:12:44,672
I think they're already acquainted
with your daughters.

83
00:12:45,448 --> 00:12:46,710
Be they single?

84
00:12:46,782 --> 00:12:48,511
Aye, single so far.

85
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,677
Well, this Illinois country's beginning
to sound better to me.

86
00:12:53,656 --> 00:12:57,114
Lilith, strike up a little tune
for these handsome lads.

87
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,592
I ain't in no mood, Pa.

88
00:12:58,661 --> 00:13:01,596
Lilith, there's a time for coaxin'.
This ain't the time.

89
00:13:06,469 --> 00:13:07,561
All right.

90
00:13:09,672 --> 00:13:12,072
"A captain bold in Halifax

91
00:13:12,174 --> 00:13:14,233
"Who lived in country quarters

92
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,301
"Betrayed a maid who hanged herself

93
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,938
- "One morning in her daughter's... "
- Lilith!

94
00:13:19,682 --> 00:13:22,651
Now, you know better
than to sing a song like that.

95
00:13:22,818 --> 00:13:25,218
- What ones do you know?
- We know "Yankee Doodle".

96
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:27,118
- "Yankee Doodle"?
- Their mother's dead.

97
00:13:27,189 --> 00:13:30,352
They haven't had much learnin'
in the social graces since we left Scotland.

98
00:13:30,426 --> 00:13:32,451
All right, give 'em
"A Home in the Meadow".

99
00:13:32,862 --> 00:13:37,526
"Away, away, come away with me

100
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:38,497
Eve, you, too.

101
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,365
- "Where the grass grows wild
- That's it.

102
00:13:41,437 --> 00:13:44,235
- "And the winds blow free
- Come on, join in.

103
00:13:44,306 --> 00:13:49,073
- "Away, away, come away with me
- That's it, that's it.

"And I'll make you a home in the meadow

Loading for the Flying Arrow.

111
00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:22,275
All aboard for the Flying Arrow.

112
00:14:23,312 --> 00:14:25,041
The Prescott family.

113
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,411
Here we be. Come on.

114
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:29,347
Alex Harvey and three sons.

115
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:32,949
Jeffrey Rose and family.

"I've got an old mule and her name is Belle

126

<i>Those who could raise the fare</i>
<i>went by steamboat to the end of the line. </i>

<i>Others found a cheaper way</i>

"... then from ten paces, hurled a knife
at the junction of the two hearts. "

133
00:15:55,804 --> 00:15:57,533
Junction, what's that?

134
00:15:58,607 --> 00:16:01,599
Well, that's where the two hearts meet.
Now, listen:

"'That was for love, deep, divine love',

"'... a plea for love undying. "'

Isn't that beautiful?

142
00:16:22,931 --> 00:16:25,491
I reckon. If anybody ever talks like that.

143
00:16:26,535 --> 00:16:29,003
Well, it's the sentiments, not the talk.

144
00:16:29,672 --> 00:16:31,606
There ain't no sense to you, Eve.

145
00:16:31,674 --> 00:16:35,201
You want to be a farm wife
but you don't want to marry a farmer.

146
00:16:35,611 --> 00:16:37,078
Neither do you.

147
00:16:37,613 --> 00:16:38,841
Of course not.

148
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:41,474
I don't want to have nothin'
to do with farms.

149
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:44,018
I want silk dresses and fine carriages...

150
00:16:44,219 --> 00:16:46,016
...and a man to smell good.

151
00:16:46,655 --> 00:16:49,123
What I want's back East, not West...

152
00:16:49,858 --> 00:16:52,190
...and I'll get there yet. You watch.

153
00:16:52,628 --> 00:16:54,687
You don't know what you want yet.

154
00:16:55,397 --> 00:16:58,025
It's the man that counts,
not where he lives.

155
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,102
- Ready, man?
- Ready.

156
00:17:42,945 --> 00:17:45,470
Daddy, somethin' comin' up river.

157
00:17:45,681 --> 00:17:47,581
Hostile Indians, I expect.

158
00:18:09,271 --> 00:18:11,796
- Could it be river pirates, Zebulon?
- Don't know.

159
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:14,936
They say no honest man
travels this river at night.

160
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,841
I can only see one man, Pa.

161
00:18:17,112 --> 00:18:20,479
I hear that's a favorite pirate trick.
They hide in the bottom of the boat...

162
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:22,278
...till they're ready to jump you.

163
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,649
- Get my gun, Colin.
- All right, Pa.

164
00:18:32,795 --> 00:18:35,059
Just come in slow and easy, stranger.

165
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:38,131
And keep your hands
where we can see 'em.

166
00:18:56,018 --> 00:18:57,576
Name's Linus Rawlings.

167
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,311
I'm hungrier than sin and real peaceful like.

168
00:19:00,689 --> 00:19:02,953
- What've you got in the craft?
- Beaver pelts.

169
00:19:03,025 --> 00:19:04,822
I said beaver pelts.

170
00:19:05,694 --> 00:19:08,720
I never had a chance to see a beaver pelt,
Mr. Rawlings.

171
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:13,090
Well, in that case, ma'am,
I'll show you one.

172
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,233
There you are.

173
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,735
Oh, that's real soft.

174
00:19:18,106 --> 00:19:19,403
It's a fine pelt, ma'am.

175
00:19:19,474 --> 00:19:21,465
Now, my apologies, sir.

176
00:19:22,344 --> 00:19:24,335
We was afraid you might be a pirate.

177
00:19:24,513 --> 00:19:25,605
I ain't no pirate.

178
00:19:25,681 --> 00:19:28,343
Come on, let's have supper
and get acquainted.

179
00:19:29,184 --> 00:19:31,880
No, no. That's yours. You keep that.

180
00:19:47,703 --> 00:19:49,898
Well, you sure set your cap in a hurry.

181
00:19:49,972 --> 00:19:52,440
Is he the backwoodsman
you've been waiting for?

182
00:19:52,507 --> 00:19:55,806
More than likely he's got
a wife and six kids waiting for him.

183
00:20:00,382 --> 00:20:03,078
"When I was single

184
00:20:04,386 --> 00:20:07,150
"Went dressed up so fine

185
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:11,591
"Now I am married

186
00:20:12,895 --> 00:20:16,126
"Go ragged all the time. "

187
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,969
Thank you, ma'am, that was right tasty.

188
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:27,497
You've only ate four plates.
I was beginning to think you didn't like it.

189
00:20:27,576 --> 00:20:30,943
Well, it don't pay to eat too much
on an empty stomach, ma'am.

190
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,348
How come you to be travelin'
so late at night?

191
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,646
Well, I'm kinda anxious
to get to Pittsburgh.

192
00:20:36,718 --> 00:20:40,381
I ain't seen a city for a long time.
I aim to whoop it up a little.

193
00:20:41,556 --> 00:20:43,922
We've never seen a mountain man before.

194
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:46,927
Tell me, them Rocky Mountains
as high as they say?

195
00:20:47,596 --> 00:20:50,827
Well, now, I just don't rightly know.
I never climbed one.

196
00:20:55,604 --> 00:20:58,198
I've, well... that just ain't exactly true.

197
00:20:59,107 --> 00:21:03,510
Jim Bridger and me,
we started up one of them little biddy...

198
00:21:03,578 --> 00:21:06,376
...Rocky Mountain foothills, you know.

199
00:21:06,782 --> 00:21:10,047
And then, one day, we see this fella...

200
00:21:10,752 --> 00:21:14,279
...and he has a great big pair
of white wings...

201
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,919
...and a harp in his hand.

202
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,285
And I said to Jim...

203
00:21:19,761 --> 00:21:23,322
...I said, "Jim, I don't like the way
that fella's lookin' at us. "

204
00:21:23,665 --> 00:21:27,624
And Jim said he didn't care too much
for it either...

205
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:30,231
...so we both skidaddled down
out of there...

206
00:21:30,305 --> 00:21:34,298
...and to this day I ain't never had
a good look at the Rocky Mountains.

207
00:21:40,782 --> 00:21:42,215
- I remember one time...
- Zebulon.

208
00:21:42,284 --> 00:21:43,046
What?

209
00:21:43,118 --> 00:21:45,416
One liar at a time is enough.

210
00:21:47,356 --> 00:21:49,824
Well, then, I reckon it's about bedtime.

211
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,954
Gotta get an early start in the mornin'.

212
00:21:52,027 --> 00:21:53,858
We'll be expectin' you for breakfast.

213
00:21:53,929 --> 00:21:56,329
Well, that's mighty hospitable,
Mr. Prescott...

214
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,559
...but sometimes I wake up
and get the urge to move.

215
00:21:58,633 --> 00:22:01,227
I might be long gone by sunup,
but I want to thank you.

216
00:22:01,436 --> 00:22:03,370
I want to thank all of you. Good night.

217
00:22:03,438 --> 00:22:04,530
Good night.

218
00:22:06,308 --> 00:22:08,367
Strange fellas, these mountain men.

219
00:22:08,443 --> 00:22:10,968
Yeah, kind of like a wisp of smoke.

220
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,961
By golly, that looks like my blanket.

221
00:22:33,035 --> 00:22:34,024
It is.

222
00:22:34,202 --> 00:22:37,638
Well, then, I'm a might confused, ma'am.
Whose bed would it be?

223
00:22:37,706 --> 00:22:38,730
Yours.

224
00:22:40,308 --> 00:22:44,005
I ain't never saw a bed like that
since last time I come East.

225
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,511
Why'd you do it?

226
00:22:47,215 --> 00:22:50,616
It ain't polite to ask a girl
why she done something for a man.

227
00:22:51,053 --> 00:22:53,817
No. Well, I reckon my manners
ain't much at that.

228
00:22:53,889 --> 00:22:56,380
Anyway, I sure thank you.
Good night, ma'am.

229
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:04,094
Are them Indian girls pretty?

230
00:23:04,332 --> 00:23:08,166
Well, now, I reckon that all depends
on just how long a man's gone...

231
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:09,861
...without seein' one.

232
00:23:11,206 --> 00:23:13,800
How long's it been
since you seen a white girl?

233
00:23:14,776 --> 00:23:17,244
I ain't quite sure why you asked that.

234
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,616
How pretty do I look to you?

235
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,319
Ain't you just bein' a little bit forward?

236
00:23:29,091 --> 00:23:31,787
You're headed upriver
and I'm headed down.

237
00:23:32,727 --> 00:23:35,161
There's no time
to get these questions answered.

238
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,534
You dead sure you want 'em answered?

239
00:23:42,637 --> 00:23:43,626
Yes.

240
00:23:57,586 --> 00:23:58,780
Oh, glory be!

241
00:24:00,922 --> 00:24:03,356
Ma'am, it seems like
you've been kissed before.

242
00:24:05,727 --> 00:24:08,059
I've never been kissed permanent before.

243
00:24:09,431 --> 00:24:11,865
By golly, you sure use surprising words.

244
00:24:11,933 --> 00:24:15,835
I never heard permanent mixed up
with a thing like a kiss before.

245
00:24:17,739 --> 00:24:19,673
I can still feel that kiss.

246
00:24:20,408 --> 00:24:21,306
Can you?

247
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:24,311
You said somethin' before
we hadn't oughta forget:

248
00:24:24,412 --> 00:24:27,848
I'm headin' upstream
and you're headed downstream.

249
00:24:28,984 --> 00:24:31,817
Lovers have parted before
and come together again.

250
00:24:34,923 --> 00:24:37,892
Eve, I, I'm a sinful man.

251
00:24:39,928 --> 00:24:41,919
I'm deep, dark, sinful.

252
00:24:41,997 --> 00:24:44,898
I'm on my way to Pittsburgh
to be sinful again.

253
00:24:46,101 --> 00:24:47,932
Likely I'll stay drunk for a month.

254
00:24:48,003 --> 00:24:50,938
I won't even remember
the fancy gals I dally with...

255
00:24:51,006 --> 00:24:53,941
...or the men I carve up
just out of pure cussedness...

256
00:24:54,009 --> 00:24:56,034
...any more than I'll remember you.

257
00:24:57,512 --> 00:25:00,913
Linus, I'm askin' you.
Can you still feel that kiss?

258
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,408
Eve...

259
00:25:05,453 --> 00:25:09,981
Eve, you make me feel like a man
standing on a narrow ledge...

260
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:13,322
...comin' face to face with a grizzly bear.

261
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:18,892
There just ain't no ignorin' the situation.

262
00:25:40,755 --> 00:25:42,279
Eve!

263
00:25:48,163 --> 00:25:49,790
Eve! Where is she?

264
00:25:50,732 --> 00:25:53,257
Anyways, you're here.
I thought you'd gone with him.

265
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,770
- Gone?
- Yes, gone.

266
00:25:57,205 --> 00:25:59,230
I knowed you were settin' with him...

267
00:25:59,507 --> 00:26:02,442
...but I kept tellin' myself
at least she's lookin' at a man.

268
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:05,240
Even a wisp of smoke like that
is better than...

269
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:11,613
Are you cryin'? Cryin' for him?
Now, what does that mean?

270
00:26:12,787 --> 00:26:14,652
Now, tell me what that means.

271
00:26:15,957 --> 00:26:17,185
Nothin', Pa.

272
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,422
What time did you come to bed?

273
00:26:20,228 --> 00:26:21,627
It was early, Pa.

274
00:26:22,797 --> 00:26:24,492
It wasn't. It was late.

275
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,898
Daughter, I'm only gonna ask you once.

276
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:31,239
Is there anything for your ma and pa
to worry about?

277
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,807
No, Pa, there ain't.

278
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,489
He'll be back.

279
00:26:53,495 --> 00:26:54,928
I'll see him again.

280
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:58,429
But you expected to see him this morning.
You know you did.

281
00:26:59,067 --> 00:27:01,228
I don't care. I'll see him again.

282
00:27:02,671 --> 00:27:03,695
Look.

283
00:27:10,245 --> 00:27:12,270
You got a growed man to do that?

284
00:27:12,414 --> 00:27:14,678
I did, just like in the book.

285
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,451
Did you get him to say them crazy words?

286
00:27:19,321 --> 00:27:22,552
I told you before, it ain't the words,
it's the sentiment.

287
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:27,019
You mean he didn't even giggle or nothin'
at such foolishness?

288
00:27:27,929 --> 00:27:30,363
He said it was a real solemn occasion...

289
00:27:31,366 --> 00:27:34,062
...like shootin' the rapids without a paddle.

290
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:39,939
No matter what he said, he did it just
to get rid of you so as he could clear out.

291
00:27:40,008 --> 00:27:41,441
You know that's so.

292
00:27:42,444 --> 00:27:46,346
And you're lucky he did. Do you want
to live like a squaw all your life?

293
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,507
Go on, say anything you like...

294
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:51,541
...but I'll see him again. I know I will.

295
00:27:52,187 --> 00:27:54,417
And he ain't got a wife and six kids.

296
00:27:55,056 --> 00:27:57,024
He ain't got a wife at all yet.

297
00:28:11,206 --> 00:28:14,073
Pierre, someone's comin' upriver.

298
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,250
Customer.

299
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:42,228
Trapper, seems like.
See how that cover bellies up?

300
00:28:42,737 --> 00:28:44,261
Could be furs.

301
00:28:56,518 --> 00:28:57,849
Thirsty, mister?

302
00:28:58,253 --> 00:29:01,586
Drier than a grasshopper on a hot griddle.

303
00:29:05,059 --> 00:29:07,391
Well, welcome to our little inn, sir.

304
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,855
My name is Jeb Hawkins,
late colonel of the Alabama militia.

305
00:29:10,932 --> 00:29:12,365
- Where you bound for?
- Pittsburgh.

306
00:29:12,434 --> 00:29:13,662
Pittsburgh?

307
00:29:13,735 --> 00:29:16,431
Looks like he's got
a whole canoe of furs, Pop.

308
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:18,901
- A sure enough mountain man.
- Indeed.

309
00:29:18,973 --> 00:29:22,670
One of our brave explorers gonna extend
our domain to the far shores of the Pacific.

310
00:29:22,744 --> 00:29:25,008
Nothin' but the finest for you, sir.
Whiskey?

311
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:26,068
Right.

312
00:29:26,214 --> 00:29:27,943
No pepper or rattlesnake heads in this.

313
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,314
Nothin' but the pure grain
and the sweet kiss of the malt.

314
00:29:30,385 --> 00:29:32,910
Never mind the cup, I'll just take the jug.

315
00:29:33,888 --> 00:29:35,480
A real mountain man, eh?

316
00:29:35,557 --> 00:29:37,388
I trust you'll toast our noble banner, sir.

317
00:29:37,459 --> 00:29:38,790
I sure will.

318
00:30:00,281 --> 00:30:02,545
Golly, you're right.
That's real sippin' liquor.

319
00:30:02,617 --> 00:30:03,709
Pa, him being a trapper...

320
00:30:03,785 --> 00:30:06,413
...do you suppose he might know
what that varmint is we got?

321
00:30:06,488 --> 00:30:09,321
Well, say, now, he might.
Yes, sir, he just might.

322
00:30:09,424 --> 00:30:11,688
Sir, we catched us a cave-dwellin' critter...

323
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:13,818
...that no man in these parts
has ever seen before.

324
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:17,592
And, you know, it'd be right satisfyin'
havin' you tell us what it is.

325
00:30:17,665 --> 00:30:20,964
Well, I don't know too much
about cave-dwellin' varmints.

326
00:30:21,603 --> 00:30:23,833
Just yonder, take your jug.

327
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:30,908
I don't know...

328
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:49,919
It's right over here.

329
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:03,139
You know any sweet-talkin' girls
in Pittsburgh?

330
00:31:03,211 --> 00:31:05,179
No, nary a one, yet.

331
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,480
Pop and I are hopin' we'll vacation there.

332
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:11,610
I'll be at the Duquesne House
if it ain't burned down.

333
00:31:12,654 --> 00:31:14,019
Hey there, now...

334
00:31:14,522 --> 00:31:18,288
You pretty girl,
you sure you got a varmint in here?

335
00:31:20,995 --> 00:31:22,394
Do you hear him?

336
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:24,698
He breathes loud and fierce.

337
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,836
- We keep him in this hole just yonder.
- You keep him in there?

338
00:31:31,606 --> 00:31:33,471
You gotta look a little closer.

339
00:31:53,928 --> 00:31:55,828
Well, he seed the varmint, Pa.

340
00:31:55,897 --> 00:31:57,023
Well done, daughter.

341
00:31:57,098 --> 00:31:58,588
I ain't so sure.

342
00:31:58,933 --> 00:32:02,425
He was hard-muscled. I could feel
the blade just kinda skitter along his ribs.

343
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,767
You just need more practice, that's all.

344
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:07,330
It's a pity you ain't got the knack
your ma had...

345
00:32:07,408 --> 00:32:09,000
...Lord rest her soul.

346
00:32:09,611 --> 00:32:10,669
All right, men...

347
00:32:10,745 --> 00:32:11,803
Lay into it, men.

348
00:32:11,879 --> 00:32:14,848
Come on, we've got a lot of fish to fry.

349
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:16,482
Down to the island.

350
00:33:13,941 --> 00:33:16,637
Tell Pa them settlers' rafts are comin'.

351
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,134
Can't I have this toilet water, Pa?

352
00:33:43,237 --> 00:33:46,104
- Genuine Parisian Accent, it says.
- How much is it?

353
00:33:46,374 --> 00:33:47,966
It's only 15 cents.

354
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,940
Fifteen cents! Put it back.

355
00:33:50,044 --> 00:33:54,344
You're right, sir. Absolutely right.
You save the pennies and dollars will grow.

356
00:33:54,415 --> 00:33:56,440
Likely you've growed many a dollar,
ain't you?

357
00:33:56,517 --> 00:33:59,884
Mr. Peddler, all my life I've been strivin'
to avoid becomin' a millionaire...

358
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,922
...and I think I've succeeded right well.

359
00:34:01,989 --> 00:34:04,719
I've got a little put away in the sock
and it'll stay right there.

360
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:07,192
Well, now, them's my sentiments exactly.

361
00:34:07,328 --> 00:34:09,762
Now, you, sir...
You look like a man of property.

362
00:34:09,831 --> 00:34:13,858
Now, if I was to bet,
I'd say you was worth a $1,000.

363
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,561
Pretty close to the mark?

364
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,069
Well, close, maybe.

365
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,858
Colin, how much powder we got left?

366
00:35:14,929 --> 00:35:17,261
Don't be afeerd, now, don't be afeerd.

367
00:35:17,331 --> 00:35:19,060
Now, there's women and children here.

368
00:35:19,133 --> 00:35:22,591
You gents wouldn't want us to have
to start shootin', now, would you?

369
00:35:22,937 --> 00:35:24,632
Be of good cheer, folks.

370
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:27,569
Why, it's in our noble tradition
to conquer the wilderness...

371
00:35:27,642 --> 00:35:30,133
...with nothin' but our bare hands
and stout hearts.

372
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:34,238
You can build new rafts and sally forth
in the spirit of your forefathers.

373
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,577
Why, you pious old scoundrel.

374
00:35:37,585 --> 00:35:39,143
I'll see you burn.

375
00:35:46,961 --> 00:35:48,690
Americans can't be whipped.

376
00:35:49,964 --> 00:35:51,022
It's him.

377
00:35:51,365 --> 00:35:53,424
I knew he'd come back. It's him.

378
00:36:50,391 --> 00:36:52,859
Now, let us pray.

379
00:36:55,229 --> 00:36:56,423
Oh, Lord...

380
00:36:58,399 --> 00:37:00,526
...we thank Thee for our salvation.

381
00:37:01,202 --> 00:37:04,296
We commit the souls of our dead
to Thy gentle keepin'.

382
00:37:05,606 --> 00:37:08,200
We pray for a speedy recovery
of our wounded.

383
00:37:11,512 --> 00:37:13,207
And, now, another matter.

384
00:37:14,548 --> 00:37:15,640
Oh, Lord...

385
00:37:17,051 --> 00:37:19,019
...without consulting with Thee...

386
00:37:19,687 --> 00:37:23,987
...we have sent Thy way some souls
whose evil ways passeth all understanding.

387
00:37:25,726 --> 00:37:27,853
We ask Thee humbly to receive them...

388
00:37:29,463 --> 00:37:31,431
...whether You want 'em or not.

389
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,523
Amen.

390
00:37:54,722 --> 00:37:55,984
It'll be a job.

391
00:37:56,057 --> 00:37:59,322
But I guess I can patch her up
good enough to get to Pittsburgh.

392
00:37:59,961 --> 00:38:01,428
- Linus.
- Now, Eve...

393
00:38:01,996 --> 00:38:04,430
...let's just not talk any more about it.

394
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:08,302
Linus, I'm tellin' you,
you don't know your own mind.

395
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,670
Maybe so, maybe not.

396
00:38:10,838 --> 00:38:14,205
I know I ain't sayin'
that you haven't been on my mind some.

397
00:38:14,575 --> 00:38:16,042
I ain't sayin' that.

398
00:38:16,177 --> 00:38:19,408
But I still went to see the varmint
with that pirate girl.

399
00:38:19,747 --> 00:38:22,443
I'll always be goin' to see the varmint, Eve.

400
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:26,850
I, I just ain't cut out
to be a farmer or a husband.

401
00:38:28,122 --> 00:38:31,057
Linus, I ain't never bringing up
the subject again...

402
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,284
...whether ever I see you or not.

403
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,021
Now, it's for the best.

404
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,925
I wish you Godspeed, Eve.

405
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:42,896
And I ain't said that to anybody
for a long time.

406
00:39:17,571 --> 00:39:20,506
I can see rapids ahead, Pa. White water.

407
00:39:20,841 --> 00:39:22,069
Look. Look.

408
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:24,369
Oh, we must've taken the wrong fork.

409
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,504
Let's beach her on this side.

410
00:39:26,981 --> 00:39:28,209
Harvey!

411
00:39:29,884 --> 00:39:30,976
Rapids.

412
00:39:31,585 --> 00:39:33,280
Rapids ahead! Beach her!

413
00:39:34,255 --> 00:39:35,415
Beach her!

414
00:39:38,993 --> 00:39:40,324
Hold her steady.

415
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:47,425
Strain!

416
00:39:48,836 --> 00:39:50,531
Pa, we're in the current.

417
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,140
Get inside, Zeke.

418
00:39:57,344 --> 00:39:58,709
No, I don't wanna.

419
00:40:05,252 --> 00:40:06,810
Straighten her, Pa.

420
00:40:09,023 --> 00:40:10,115
Lilith!

421
00:40:30,377 --> 00:40:31,674
Hold it steady!

422
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:35,671
I can't!

423
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,360
Go on. Go on and help Pa.

424
00:41:55,496 --> 00:41:56,656
I'll get it.

425
00:42:12,813 --> 00:42:14,747
Lilith! Lilith!

426
00:42:50,584 --> 00:42:52,313
Lie down!

427
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,614
Lie down!

428
00:43:30,291 --> 00:43:31,519
What happened?

429
00:43:31,759 --> 00:43:35,490
They took the wrong fork of the river
and they went over the falls.

430
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,164
Did you happen to hear
the name of the family?

431
00:43:38,332 --> 00:43:40,698
Prescott, I think. Something like that.

432
00:43:55,816 --> 00:43:57,943
As soon as they're buried decent...

433
00:43:58,018 --> 00:44:01,044
...I'm heading back East
on the first boat that comes along.

434
00:44:01,121 --> 00:44:04,215
And if you were in your right mind,
you would, too.

435
00:44:34,321 --> 00:44:35,618
Oh, Linus.

436
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:09,312
"Rock of ages, cleft for me

437
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:15,785
"Let me hide myself in thee

438
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:22,291
"Let the water and the blood

439
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:28,331
"From thy side, a healing flood

440
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:34,179
"Be of sin the double cure

441
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:41,049
"Cleanse me from its guilt and power. "

442
00:46:00,641 --> 00:46:02,836
Would you walk with me a piece, Eve?

443
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:24,256
Eve, I...

444
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:30,061
Eve, all the time I was paddlin' down here
I was thinkin'...

445
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:34,569
...if I found you alive, I'd...

446
00:46:36,243 --> 00:46:38,677
Would you come to Pittsburgh
with me, Eve?

447
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,643
I'm stayin' right here.

448
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:49,045
I ain't movin' a foot one way or the other.

449
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,386
Now would you explain that a little?

450
00:46:55,496 --> 00:46:57,896
Ma and Pa,
they wanted a farm in the West...

451
00:46:58,799 --> 00:47:00,892
...and this is as far as they got.

452
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:05,599
Seems to me this is where the Lord
wanted the farm to be.

453
00:47:05,772 --> 00:47:08,832
But your brother, Sam, he's bad hurt,
and winter's comin'...

454
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:11,377
There's no sense talkin' about it.
I'm gonna do it.

455
00:47:11,445 --> 00:47:13,845
Eve, you just ain't makin' much sense.

456
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:19,074
Half the people that come West
don't make much sense, I reckon.

457
00:47:24,324 --> 00:47:25,382
All right.

458
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:27,651
All right.

459
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:32,254
By golly, you're a strong-minded woman.

460
00:47:35,168 --> 00:47:38,228
I reckon I seen that varmint
for the last time.

461
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:28,977
<i>The westward course was no smoother</i>
<i>than that of true love. </i>

462
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:34,351
<i>Not only the hard hand of nature</i>
<i>was against it, but the impediment of war. </i>

463
00:48:34,895 --> 00:48:38,331
<i>Trouble over land smoldered</i>
<i>along the Mexican border. </i>

464
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:42,831
<i>Not all Americans were for war, including</i>
<i>Congressman Abe Lincoln of Illinois. </i>

465
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:45,099
<i>But a war did break out... </i>

466
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:48,599
<i>... and in the end vast new territories</i>
<i>came into the Union... </i>

467
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:50,438
<i>... along with their rich Spanish names:</i>

468
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:53,946
<i>Rio Grande, Santa Fe, Albuquerque,</i>
<i>El Paso... </i>

469
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:57,241
<i>... and most glittering of all, California... </i>

470
00:48:57,784 --> 00:49:02,346
<i>... named after a mythical island of pearls</i>
<i>and gold in a 15th century novel. </i>

471
00:49:02,656 --> 00:49:05,022
<i>Here, in 1848... </i>

472
00:49:05,559 --> 00:49:09,290
<i>... at Sutter"s Mill, a man found something</i>
<i>he wasn"t even looking for... </i>

473
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:10,955
<i>... at the bottom of a ditch. </i>

474
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:14,330
<i>And the cry of his discovery was heard</i>
<i>clear across the continent... </i>

475
00:49:14,401 --> 00:49:17,529
<i>... in Boston, New York, Savannah,</i>
<i>and across the oceans... </i>

476
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:19,535
<i>... in London, Paris, Berlin. </i>

477
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:22,671
<i>But nowhere was the clamor of gold... </i>

478
00:49:23,243 --> 00:49:25,905
<i>... heard more eagerly than in St. Louis... </i>

479
00:49:26,279 --> 00:49:28,804
<i>... the busiest fur trading center</i>
<i>in the world... </i>

480
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:32,875
<i>... and the noisiest, bawdiest,</i>
<i>most uppity town west of New York. </i>

481
00:50:00,047 --> 00:50:01,878
"Boys, hold your hosses

482
00:50:01,982 --> 00:50:03,745
"We're still the bosses

483
00:50:03,817 --> 00:50:05,182
"Please hold your hosses

484
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,049
"Till we get...

485
00:50:07,554 --> 00:50:10,318
"... to the dance!"

486
00:50:22,869 --> 00:50:24,928
I say there's no more than three.

487
00:50:25,405 --> 00:50:28,203
Six? It's all that lace that fooled you.
I still say three.

488
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,766
Watch him.
I hear Cleve's an expert on petticoats.

489
00:50:30,844 --> 00:50:32,175
Anyway, you can never prove it.

490
00:50:32,245 --> 00:50:34,406
Gentlemen, we're going to be late
for that poker game.

491
00:50:34,481 --> 00:50:37,143
I've just stuck you for
the most expensive dinner in St. Louis...

492
00:50:37,217 --> 00:50:39,310
...and I don't mind sticking you
a little bit deeper.

493
00:50:39,386 --> 00:50:41,286
I'll lay you $100 if it's no less than six.

494
00:50:41,354 --> 00:50:43,948
- How will you prove it?
- Go backstage and find out.

495
00:50:44,024 --> 00:50:45,548
If I go back and check with you.

496
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:46,751
Fair enough.

497
00:50:54,668 --> 00:50:55,794
Second girl.

498
00:51:00,107 --> 00:51:02,132
- Miss Prescott?
- Later.

499
00:51:02,275 --> 00:51:03,936
It's rather important.

500
00:51:04,845 --> 00:51:06,403
It's always important.

501
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,005
The older they are,
the more important it gets.

502
00:51:09,082 --> 00:51:11,642
Miss Prescott, please. I'm Hylan Seabury...

503
00:51:12,018 --> 00:51:14,578
...attorney in the matter
of Jonathan Brooks.

504
00:51:15,422 --> 00:51:17,117
He means nothing to you?

505
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:18,856
That old goat?

506
00:51:18,959 --> 00:51:21,427
You must've meant something to him,
Miss Prescott.

507
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:23,588
- Why?
- You're included in his will.

508
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:27,463
Of course, you'll have to make the trip
to California to claim the bequest.

509
00:51:27,534 --> 00:51:29,866
Well, now, I wouldn't go to California...

510
00:51:29,936 --> 00:51:32,837
...if John Jacob Astor left me
San Francisco.

511
00:51:33,206 --> 00:51:35,674
I don't think Mr. Astor had holdings there.

512
00:51:35,742 --> 00:51:39,269
However, the yield from
Mr. Brooks' property is not to be scorned.

513
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,540
Yield of what?

514
00:51:40,614 --> 00:51:42,673
Gold, Miss Prescott. Gold.

515
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:45,513
- Gold?
- Precisely.

516
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:47,717
You own a gold mine, Miss Prescott.

517
00:51:47,788 --> 00:51:50,723
It yielded $3,500 the very first week.

518
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:53,022
Gold mine?

519
00:51:58,832 --> 00:52:00,595
That sweet old goat!

520
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:22,150
This is an unexpected pleasure.

521
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:23,314
Where's the money?

522
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,379
Money?

523
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:25,547
Money?

524
00:52:25,792 --> 00:52:29,558
Oh, yes. You're referring, of course,
to our little agreement.

525
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,532
One hundred to start you off...

526
00:52:33,033 --> 00:52:35,058
...and my share of the winnings.

527
00:52:36,136 --> 00:52:40,470
Well, I'm somewhat embarrassed to report
that the $100 no longer exists.

528
00:52:42,776 --> 00:52:44,744
That $100, I assure you...

529
00:52:44,811 --> 00:52:48,508
...will turn out to be the best investment
you have ever made.

530
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:51,244
I have plans, gentlemen...

531
00:52:51,818 --> 00:52:53,752
...beyond your wildest dreams.

532
00:52:54,688 --> 00:52:58,351
I'm gonna earn you a piece of a gold mine.

533
00:52:58,859 --> 00:52:59,951
Gold mine!

534
00:53:01,328 --> 00:53:03,125
You ain't gonna earn nothin'!

535
00:53:03,363 --> 00:53:06,389
You ain't gonna be nothin',
you ain't gonna do nothin'...

536
00:53:06,466 --> 00:53:08,491
...unless we get that $100 back
by the morning.

537
00:53:08,568 --> 00:53:10,536
Grimes, you don't mean that.

538
00:53:11,171 --> 00:53:13,105
You're gonna kill off the golden goose.

539
00:53:13,173 --> 00:53:15,073
Call it what you want, mister.

540
00:53:15,208 --> 00:53:16,539
We'll be waitin'.

541
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:44,195
<i>Independence, Missouri, was the jump-off</i>
<i>point for emigrants from everywhere. </i>

542
00:53:45,005 --> 00:53:48,600
<i>Solid, God-fearing families bound</i>
<i>for the farmlands of Oregon... </i>

543
00:53:49,542 --> 00:53:54,479
<i>... and get-rich-quick adventurers</i>
<i>raced for the gold of California. </i>

544
00:53:57,384 --> 00:53:58,476
Try it.

545
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:05,916
You got a wagon, I suppose?

546
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:07,186
I can get one.

547
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:08,557
And a team to pull it?

548
00:54:08,628 --> 00:54:10,425
I can get everything I need.

549
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:12,195
You got a husband?

550
00:54:12,265 --> 00:54:14,096
I'm single, Mr. Morgan.

551
00:54:14,567 --> 00:54:16,159
No travelin' companion?

552
00:54:16,903 --> 00:54:18,666
No, I'm travelin' alone.

553
00:54:18,772 --> 00:54:20,330
Not on my wagon train.

554
00:54:21,107 --> 00:54:23,905
Alone and single brings out
the deviltry in a man.

555
00:54:23,977 --> 00:54:27,208
Gets 'em all worked up
and they're wild enough already.

556
00:54:27,447 --> 00:54:29,813
I intend to keep to myself, Mr. Morgan.

557
00:54:30,717 --> 00:54:32,480
A woman of your sort?

558
00:54:33,453 --> 00:54:38,186
One day you'd find yourself in trouble and
there'd be hell to pay just figurin' out who.

559
00:54:38,458 --> 00:54:40,688
What did you say, Mr. Morgan?

560
00:54:41,962 --> 00:54:46,023
Well, now, ain't you the feisty one!
I like spirit in a woman.

561
00:54:48,268 --> 00:54:50,930
You got a pretty face
under that powder, too.

562
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:54,272
And a fine, sturdy body
under them clothes, I wager.

563
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:59,743
There's a woman named Clegg,
Aggie Clegg.

564
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,175
Why don't you go see her?

565
00:55:10,457 --> 00:55:11,549
Thanks.

566
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:22,565
I told you, no.

567
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:26,098
I was hoping to make this trip
with a husband.

568
00:55:26,506 --> 00:55:28,303
Nearly got one last week.

569
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:31,571
Look, I hear there's 40 men
to every woman in California.

570
00:55:32,212 --> 00:55:34,043
Miss Clegg, I'd be willing to pay you.

571
00:55:34,114 --> 00:55:36,912
I don't need money, I need a man.

572
00:55:39,319 --> 00:55:40,411
Any man.

573
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:48,991
Mornin', ladies.

574
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:51,695
Beautiful mornin'.

575
00:55:53,233 --> 00:55:56,464
Would you, by any chance,
happen to be Miss Lily Prescott?

576
00:55:57,237 --> 00:55:59,398
Not unless you got a big imagination.

577
00:55:59,472 --> 00:56:01,872
Then, you must be the lady in question.

578
00:56:02,542 --> 00:56:05,033
Cleve van Valen, Miss Prescott,
at your service.

579
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:07,773
At your every command
from here to California.

580
00:56:07,981 --> 00:56:11,348
Well, thank you,
but whatever you're offering, I don't need.

581
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:14,817
Perhaps you don't understand.

582
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:18,321
Yes, I do. I know a tinhorn when I see one.

583
00:56:18,858 --> 00:56:20,120
Miss Prescott!

584
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:23,523
I'm offerin' you an honest days' work
for an honest days' pay.

585
00:56:23,596 --> 00:56:26,087
Goodbye, Mr. van Valen. Goodbye.

586
00:56:28,268 --> 00:56:31,032
Well, it's been a pleasure to meet you,
Miss Clegg.

587
00:56:31,104 --> 00:56:35,404
May I say I have never seen a woman
with more beautiful hair.

588
00:56:36,409 --> 00:56:38,502
What a prize catch it will make...

589
00:56:39,012 --> 00:56:41,378
...hanging from the waist of an Indian.

590
00:56:42,248 --> 00:56:44,341
Beauty, alone in the wilderness...

591
00:56:44,617 --> 00:56:46,482
...and who's to protect you?

592
00:56:47,053 --> 00:56:48,247
No one.

593
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:52,155
Not one person
won't be looking after himself.

594
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:56,319
Well...

595
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:00,163
Good day, ladies.

596
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:01,725
Good day.

597
00:57:06,372 --> 00:57:08,840
Nobody ever said that to me before.

598
00:57:09,776 --> 00:57:10,800
What?

599
00:57:11,911 --> 00:57:14,641
That I had such... such beautiful hair.

600
00:57:18,618 --> 00:57:20,210
You know something?

601
00:57:20,987 --> 00:57:24,514
I got a hunch you're gonna draw men
like fish to the bait.

602
00:57:25,658 --> 00:57:28,525
Maybe I can catch one of them
while they swim by.

603
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:32,127
You got yourself a partner.

604
00:57:32,999 --> 00:57:34,057
Thank you.

605
00:57:36,302 --> 00:57:37,530
How's it, Ben?

606
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:42,171
It's all clear up through here. Look for a
little mudhole up through the next pocket.

607
00:57:42,242 --> 00:57:44,233
- How far?
- Maybe half or a quarter.

608
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:47,473
- Well, thanks.
- Looks a little higher up on that ridge.

609
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:51,377
There's a water hole up there
about half a mile. Let's head for it.

610
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:01,122
Water hole about a half a mile ahead.

611
00:58:05,665 --> 00:58:07,132
Hey, you're drivin'.

612
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:10,198
I was raised on a farm.

613
00:58:14,474 --> 00:58:16,840
Water hole about a half a mile ahead.

614
00:58:54,581 --> 00:58:55,809
Hey, Aggie...

615
00:58:57,317 --> 00:58:58,614
Can you use these?

616
00:58:58,685 --> 00:59:01,017
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

617
00:59:15,034 --> 00:59:16,092
Ladies.

618
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:27,469
At your service.

619
00:59:27,947 --> 00:59:29,539
I thought we'd gotten rid of you.

620
00:59:29,616 --> 00:59:33,677
Well, I just couldn't bear to think of
you two makin' this trip without my help.

621
00:59:33,753 --> 00:59:36,119
If I was to hear later on
that somethin' happened to you...

622
00:59:36,189 --> 00:59:37,656
...I'd never forgive myself.

623
00:59:37,724 --> 00:59:39,419
You came 100 miles alone?

624
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:43,929
Well, I had no way of countin' the miles,
Mr. Morgan, but I'll take your word for it.

625
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:46,295
You've got another 100, mister.
Goin' back.

626
00:59:46,366 --> 00:59:49,665
I told ya, when a wagon breaks down,
I want men who can fix it...

627
00:59:49,736 --> 00:59:51,033
...not bet how long it'll take.

628
00:59:51,104 --> 00:59:53,129
You don't mean you'll turn me out?

629
00:59:53,473 --> 00:59:56,101
Pass me adrift at the mercy
of savage Indians?

630
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:58,439
If you don't get movin', I'll cast you adrift...

631
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:00,877
I appeal to your sportin' instinct, sir.

632
01:00:01,581 --> 01:00:04,709
I'm prepared to wager you
that I stay with this train.

633
01:00:04,817 --> 01:00:05,784
Well, you got a wager.

634
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,513
Wait a minute.

635
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:09,921
The fact is, I hired this man.

636
01:00:10,323 --> 01:00:12,314
We'll put up his stake.

637
01:00:14,794 --> 01:00:16,591
Is that right, Miss Prescott?

638
01:00:16,663 --> 01:00:18,392
If Miss Clegg says so.

639
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:31,101
Ma'am...

640
01:00:32,245 --> 01:00:34,042
...I'll be forever grateful.

641
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:39,843
Now, I'll unpack my gear.

642
01:00:44,023 --> 01:00:46,287
Agatha, have you gone crazy?

643
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:49,828
He says he's a man
wantin' to do an honest days work.

644
01:00:50,997 --> 01:00:53,659
And he'll do it. I can promise you that.

645
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:58,231
Hey, you men on that last wagon,
keep up that slack.

646
01:00:58,304 --> 01:00:59,430
Keep it up.

647
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:02,974
Get that team movin'.
Keep 'em movin' there.

648
01:01:06,546 --> 01:01:08,673
Don't let those lines sag.

649
01:01:10,483 --> 01:01:12,075
Keep 'em up. Keep 'em up.

650
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:18,147
Keep those teams movin'.

651
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:22,258
Keep 'em movin'.

652
01:01:23,663 --> 01:01:25,392
Don't let those lines sag.

653
01:01:26,899 --> 01:01:28,890
You on that middle team, keep 'em movin'.

654
01:01:39,712 --> 01:01:41,703
Get in there.

655
01:01:44,417 --> 01:01:46,681
Get in there, mule.

656
01:02:21,587 --> 01:02:24,852
I'm just overwhelmed by all this attention,
Miss Prescott.

657
01:02:33,433 --> 01:02:34,923
I want to confess...

658
01:02:35,635 --> 01:02:39,162
...I have lied about why
I wanted to work for you.

659
01:02:40,673 --> 01:02:41,765
I know.

660
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:46,505
The real reason is, of course,
that I'm in love with you.

661
01:02:47,146 --> 01:02:49,239
Now, it's the truth.

662
01:02:50,082 --> 01:02:52,175
From the first moment I saw you...

663
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:55,146
...I've known that I couldn't live
without you.

664
01:02:57,590 --> 01:03:00,718
I'd hate to be the cause
of your death, Mr. van Valen.

665
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:04,091
I don't speak lightly, Miss Prescott.

666
01:03:04,163 --> 01:03:07,758
I'm prepared to assume
the responsibilities of a faithful husband.

667
01:03:08,668 --> 01:03:12,069
Oh, and are you ready to assume
the responsibilities...

668
01:03:12,138 --> 01:03:14,470
...of my property, too, Mr. van Valen?

669
01:03:15,675 --> 01:03:19,111
Really? What, what kind of property?

670
01:03:20,446 --> 01:03:22,004
Gold, Mr. van Valen.

671
01:03:22,515 --> 01:03:25,177
Gold by the ton from what I understand.

672
01:03:25,852 --> 01:03:28,320
Bright, yellow, shiny gold.

673
01:03:32,492 --> 01:03:34,221
I had no idea.

674
01:03:35,995 --> 01:03:37,292
I'm sure you hadn't.

675
01:03:37,363 --> 01:03:39,297
Miss Prescott, I really mean...

676
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:41,165
Here comes Agatha.

677
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:44,028
If you must propose to somebody...

678
01:03:44,403 --> 01:03:46,963
...I suggest you get on your knees to her.

679
01:03:47,206 --> 01:03:49,401
Besides, she has beautiful hair.

680
01:03:52,211 --> 01:03:53,337
Look at 'em.

681
01:03:54,046 --> 01:03:56,947
You'd think they was gettin' ready
to bury somebody.

682
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:59,210
Ain't we worn down enough as it is?

683
01:04:00,219 --> 01:04:02,483
Well, let's wake 'em up.

684
01:04:06,893 --> 01:04:08,360
Listen, everybody.

685
01:04:09,395 --> 01:04:12,990
"Come on along, everybody come along

686
01:04:13,666 --> 01:04:16,635
"While that moon am shinin' bright

687
01:04:17,470 --> 01:04:20,962
"Come on along
And raise your voice in song

688
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:24,441
"We're gonna raise a ruckus tonight

689
01:04:25,545 --> 01:04:29,106
"It ain't no time to sit 'n brood
Raise a ruckus tonight

690
01:04:29,415 --> 01:04:33,317
"It's time to strike a lively mood
Raise a ruckus tonight

691
01:04:33,586 --> 01:04:37,386
"Go and get that old banjo
Raise a ruckus tonight

692
01:04:37,557 --> 01:04:41,152
"Just pat your foot and tap your toe
Raise a ruckus tonight

693
01:04:41,227 --> 01:04:45,596
"Do ya hear me?
Come on along, little children, come along

694
01:04:46,265 --> 01:04:48,893
"While that moon am shinin' bright

695
01:04:49,035 --> 01:04:53,096
"Come along now and tune up that string
And let that banjo ring

696
01:04:53,205 --> 01:04:56,766
"We're gonna raise a ruckus tonight!"

697
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:58,901
Sing it out, now!

698
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:30,666
That's the spirit. That's the way to feel.

699
01:05:39,819 --> 01:05:41,377
Oh, hiya, Mr. Morgan!

700
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:57,359
Aggie, for lunch.

701
01:05:58,070 --> 01:06:00,231
Thanks. Nice not to fish.

702
01:06:08,881 --> 01:06:10,473
What is it, Mr. Morgan?

703
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:13,978
Miss Prescott, I've been thinking.

704
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:21,959
Wet or dry, you're the handsomest woman
I ever did see.

705
01:06:22,495 --> 01:06:24,395
Spirit and a fine sturdy body.

706
01:06:25,564 --> 01:06:27,964
It's a noble combination, Miss Prescott.

707
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:32,168
Why, for you, child-bearin'
would come as easy as rolling off a log.

708
01:06:34,473 --> 01:06:38,000
Well, I think I'd rather roll off a log,
Mr. Morgan.

709
01:06:39,011 --> 01:06:41,775
Ma'am, I'm tellin' you,
you got the build for it.

710
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:43,840
I want you for my wife.

711
01:06:45,051 --> 01:06:47,679
I've got a cattle ranch
just below the Merced.

712
01:06:48,387 --> 01:06:50,947
I'll be settlin' down there, fit and proper.

713
01:06:52,491 --> 01:06:55,187
I'm sure you're very fit and proper,
Mr. Morgan.

714
01:06:56,062 --> 01:06:57,256
Well, then...

715
01:06:57,797 --> 01:07:00,698
...you just couldn't do no better
than marryin' me.

716
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:04,228
Why, we'd have ourselves a fine family
in no time at all.

717
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:07,367
I believe that.

718
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:11,334
I'm sorry, Mr. Morgan, but...

719
01:07:12,344 --> 01:07:13,868
...I can't accept your proposal.

720
01:07:13,946 --> 01:07:15,038
Why not?

721
01:07:16,382 --> 01:07:17,406
Well...

722
01:07:17,650 --> 01:07:20,744
A woman likes to hear something
a little more inviting.

723
01:07:22,021 --> 01:07:24,956
Well, ain't that what I've been doin'?
Invitin' you?

724
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:28,218
Invitin' you to share my life, Miss Prescott.

725
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:32,855
I'm sorry, Mr. Morgan.

726
01:07:35,267 --> 01:07:37,201
It's somethin' else, ain't it?

727
01:07:38,404 --> 01:07:40,702
Must be somethin' else naggin' at you.

728
01:07:44,243 --> 01:07:46,768
I don't aim to let it stop me, Miss Prescott.

729
01:07:48,347 --> 01:07:49,939
You can count on that.

730
01:07:50,282 --> 01:07:51,613
What did he want?

731
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:54,578
Children.

732
01:07:55,821 --> 01:07:56,913
Children?

733
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:58,752
Well, I'll be...

734
01:08:00,059 --> 01:08:02,789
Why didn't he come shopping
at the right store?

735
01:08:46,305 --> 01:08:47,636
I'll take a look.

736
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:51,237
Gentlemen, are we pikers?

737
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:54,574
I'm gonna see
and I'm gonna raise this fine pistol.

738
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:57,205
London-made and loaded for bear.

739
01:08:57,850 --> 01:08:59,647
I'll take part of that bet.

740
01:09:07,092 --> 01:09:09,993
I told you I wouldn't stand
for you fleecin' any...

741
01:09:13,165 --> 01:09:14,257
Cheyennes.

742
01:09:15,534 --> 01:09:18,002
There's too many.
We'll have to make a run for it.

743
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:19,401
You can't outrun them with the wagons.

744
01:09:19,471 --> 01:09:21,803
The minute you get movin'
cut your lead teams loose.

745
01:09:21,874 --> 01:09:23,068
Have you gone crazy?

746
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:26,074
Chances are they want our stock
more than us.

747
01:09:26,145 --> 01:09:28,306
You're a gambler, ain't you?
All right, let's get movin'.

748
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:47,960
Keep 'em closed up there.

749
01:09:59,912 --> 01:10:01,641
I don't know how to unhook them.

750
01:11:06,178 --> 01:11:08,043
Cleve, watch out!

751
01:12:10,342 --> 01:12:12,105
Joe, pick me up.

752
01:12:58,490 --> 01:13:00,458
We'll be movin' at daybreak.

753
01:13:00,993 --> 01:13:03,791
I'll take a few men
and see if we can find him.

754
01:13:04,029 --> 01:13:06,463
Give him a decent, Christian burial.

755
01:13:14,306 --> 01:13:16,501
Someone's comin'! Someone's comin'!

756
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:05,288
I can let you have this rig for $1 a day
and I'll give you a good team.

757
01:14:05,357 --> 01:14:07,291
- Pick it up in the morning.
- Fine.

758
01:14:07,359 --> 01:14:09,725
Could you tell me the way
to the Brook's claim?

759
01:14:09,795 --> 01:14:12,229
Well, the claims are down by the river.

760
01:14:12,664 --> 01:14:13,961
Which road should I take?

761
01:14:14,032 --> 01:14:16,125
Only one road, along the river.

762
01:14:16,435 --> 01:14:18,130
- Thank you.
- Sure welcome.

763
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:34,542
We're looking for a Mr. Huggins.

764
01:14:35,053 --> 01:14:36,281
You found him.

765
01:14:41,426 --> 01:14:43,894
This is Miss Lilith Prescott.

766
01:14:44,429 --> 01:14:45,487
I figured.

767
01:14:45,831 --> 01:14:48,026
They told me you was a real looker.

768
01:14:49,034 --> 01:14:52,401
It's all here for you.
Just the way Mr. Brooks staked it out.

769
01:14:52,704 --> 01:14:54,501
Must have had 20 men workin' on it.

770
01:14:55,207 --> 01:14:57,732
Where are they now?
Who's digging the gold?

771
01:14:57,843 --> 01:15:01,779
Gold? I ain't never seen a better grade
since I come here with Millie.

772
01:15:02,714 --> 01:15:04,579
But just a pocket, though.

773
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:07,310
